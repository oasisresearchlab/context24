However , it is not always successful in supporting all design activities . In contrast , especially informal collaborative design methods that are typically practiced early in the design process are still poorly supported by digital tools . Traditional workflows are often altered in negative ways due to a lack of fluency and immediacy or through incompatibility with social dynamics and embodied actions . Many design practices are thus still better supported by relying on traditional physical tools that better facilitate design as embodied , situated practice . At the same time however , digital technology is inevitable in today’s work ecology . As a result of this tension , designers frequently have to move between digital and physical tools . This thesis takes this critical gap as a central motive for investigating how digital tools can be designed to both preserve and augment existing material and social practices of collaborative design activities . By approaching potential solutions to this gap , the state of digital design and creativity support tools is advanced to better suit embodied design practices . Within this thesis , this research question is approached through the design and evaluation of new digital tools within four themes of design practice : 1 ) externalization , 2 ) reflection , 3 ) collaboration and 4 ) process . Further , as a framework to this research , a structured design methodology is developed that specifically addresses the goal of integrating digital technology with embodied design practices . This tradeoff - driven methodology is then applied to different concrete cases to demonstrate its applicability in context . Within three case studies , new concepts for supporting collaborative embodied design practices are presented . Within the first study , the interactive space AffinityTable is discussed which was designed to support the collaborative design method affinity diagramming . A second case study presents the tool IdeaVis for supporting collaborative sketching sessions . In a third case study , support for the particular activity of documenting and organizing design artifacts is explored with the interactive space ArtifactBubbles . Taken together , the case studies deliver a representation of collaborative embodied design practices . Each case study provides a detailed introduction and justification of the case selection and documents the application of the proposed tradeoff - driven design methodology throughout analysis , design and evaluation . As a result , this thesis delivers three types of contributions . As a first contribution , the thesis describes a novel design methodology than can be applied to related design problems . As a second contribution , new design concepts and interaction techniques are introduced that can be reused and adapted by other researchers or practitioners . Eventually , empirical data that relates to the effect of the designed methods on properties of design practice is provided . The thesis concludes with abstract design guidelines that bring together all contributions for reuse by researchers and practitioners . iv v Überblick Designpraktiken werden zunehmend von digitaler Technologie beeinflusst . Jedoch ist eine technische Unterstützung von Designaktivitäten nicht immer erfolgreich . Vor allem kooperative und informelle Designmethoden , die vorwiegend in frühen Prozessphasen praktiziert werden , sind nur unzureichend durch technische Hilfsmittel unterstützt . Häufig stören digitale Werkzeuge sogar den traditionellen Arbeitsfluss und etablierte soziale Dynamiken durch einen Mangel an Unmittelbarkeit und durch fehlende Direktheit und Körperlichkeit . Da diese Aspekte jedoch wichtige Charakteristiken von realen Designpraktiken sind , bevorzugen viele Designer nach wie vor traditionelle Materialen und Werkzeuge . Zugleich schreitet die Digitalisierung auch in der Design - Domäne voran , was dazu führt , dass sich Designer oft zwischen der digitalen Welt und der physischen Welt bewegen müssen . Diese Dissertation befasst sich mit der Fragestellung , wie diese beiden Welten besser überbrückt werden können , um wichtige Eigenschaften von traditionellen Materialen und Werkzeugen zu bewahren und darüber hinaus von digitalen Funktionalitäten zu profitieren . Durch die Erforschung von verschiedenen technischen Lösungsansätzen für diese Problematik , erweitert diese Arbeit vorhandene Forschungsarbeiten durch eine Fokussierung auf körperliche Aspekte zur Kreativitätsförderung . Die Studien in dieser Dissertation werden innerhalb eines Frameworks mit vier Dimensionen betrachtet : 1 ) Externalisierung , 2 ) Reflektion , 3 ) Kollaboration , und 4 ) Prozess . Zudem wird eine Methodik entwickelt , die basierend auf Design - Tradeoffs eine systematische Integration von Technologie in reale Arbeitsprozesse ermöglicht . Die Anwendbarkeit der Methodik wird in drei konkreten Fallstudien aus dem Forschungskontext demonstriert . In der ersten Fallstudie wird der Designprozess des interaktiven Raums AffintyTable diskutiert . Dieses System reichert die Designmethode Affinity Diagramming durch hybride Interaktionskonzepte an . Eine zweite Studie beschreibt IdeaVis , ein hybrides Werkzeug für die Unterstützung von Sketching - Sessions in kleinen Gruppen . In einer dritten Fallstudie wird schließlich das Werkzeug ArtifactBubbles betrachtet , ein Konzept zur Organisation und Dokumentation von Designartefakten . In jeder Fallstudie wurden die Phasen Analyse , Design und Evaluation anhand der zuvor abgeleiteten Tradeoff - basierten Designmethodik durchgeführt . Zusammengenommen liefern die Fallstudien eine Betrachtung des Forschungsgegenstandes aus unterschiedlichen Blickwinkeln . Dabei wurden die Themen der Fallstudien so ausgewählt , dass diese möglichst repräsentativ für häufig praktizierte Designmethoden sind . Die Forschungsbeiträge dieser Arbeit begründen sich in einer neuartigen Methodik zur Gestaltung interaktiver Systeme , einer Reihe von neuen Interaktionstechniken und empirischen Daten über die praktische Anwendung dieser Techniken . Schließlich werden alle diese Beiträge durch abstrakte Design - Richtlinien zusammengefasst um die Erkenntnisse anderen Forschern und Praktikern zugänglich zu machen . vi vii Publications Parts of this research were previously published in the following publications .

Computer Interaction ( HCI ) is witnessing an explosive growth and an emergence of many novel challenges . Rooted in technological developments and rapid innovations in user interface technology , the research field is not only growing more diverse and more complex , but has also experienced a shift of perspective in many different areas . From a technical standpoint , a wide range of technologies have emerged in recent years that radically changed the way people interact with computers and digital systems . New kinds of networks , sensors and displays allow for novel and entirely different forms of human - computer interaction and computer - mediated communication ( Abowd & Mynatt , 2000 ) . Traditional paradigms such as the Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) and the Windows Icons Menus and Pointers ( WIMP ) paradigm ( Dam , 1997 ) are questioned by novel concepts such as Natural User Interfaces ( NUIs ) ( Wigdor & Wixon , 2011 ) , Tangible User Interfaces ( TUIs ) ( Ishii & Ullmer , 1997 ) and Augmented Reality ( AR ) ( Feiner , Macintyre , & Seligmann , 1993 ; Wellner , 1993 ) . Under the umbrella of “Ubiquitous Computing” ( UbiComp ) ( Weiser , 1999 ) , these approaches share the common vision of integrating computing into the physical world . Thereby , technologies have created a medium of unprecedented flexibility and immediacy that does not only affect the professional workplace but also all kinds of everyday activities ( Weiser , 1999 ; Winograd , 1997 ) . In times of the disappearing computer and anytime and anyplace interactions , a discipline concerned with the “design , development and evaluation of interactive systems for human use and the study of 1 Research Context & Motivation 2 phenomena surrounding them” ( Preece , Sharp , & Rogers , 2007 ) also needs to adapt in a methodological way ( Rogers , 2004 ) . Due to the growing complexity of the potential design space for interactive systems , HCI now has to deal with “wicked” problems that are ill - defined in their nature ( Stolterman , 2008 ) . Winograd ( 1997 ) claims that today’s tradeoffs in HCI cannot always be measured and quantified because they relate to subjective aspects such as human needs , desires and values . This is in contrast to classical engineering , where tradeoffs can be defined in characteristics like performance and efficiency . As a result , HCI has evolved from a strong engineering tradition , but is now more and more influenced by design disciplines ( Winograd , 1996 ) . Fallman ( 2003 ) even argues that “HCI has emerged as a design - oriented field of research” . This change of perspective is shared by many influential scholars in HCI literature ( Buxton , 2007 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Löwgren , 1995 ; Rogers , 2004 ; Stolterman , 2008 ; Zimmerman , Forlizzi , & Evenson , 2007 ) . Buxton ( 2007 ) for example highlights that HCI has extended from a discipline concerned with engineering usable and useful products toward an additional focus on designing pleasurable and aesthetic experiences across products and services . In this new perspective that is also often labeled “Interaction Design” ( Winograd , 1997 ) , he refers to a progression from “object - centered” to “experience - centered” design . As a result of this methodological shift toward design thinking and design practice in HCI , many researchers advocate the use of informal design methods and sketching techniques that are successfully applied in other design disciplines such as industrial design . Often practiced in the early stages of a design process , these methods allow for understanding the design space as much as the problem space in its ill - defined nature ( Löwgren , 1995 ) . Many newly introduced approaches such as ethnography , participatory design ( PD ) and cultural probes ( Rogers , Sharp , & Preece , 2011 ) , Scenario - based Design ( Rosson & Carroll , 2001 ) and Contextual Design ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) have their origins in design practice and stand for a “designerly way of thinking” ( Rogers , 2004 ; Stolterman , 2008 ) . Over the years , the palette of tools and techniques in HCI was also extended to encompass more creative and generative activities like brainstorming , affinity diagramming , card sorting , sketching and other informal methods aimed at dealing with the increased complexity and ambiguousness of “wicked problems” and divergent as well as convergent thinking ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . Today , creative methods are increasingly being taught and practiced by scholars in academia as well as by practitioners in industry ( Buxton , 2007 ; Greenberg , Carpendale , Marquardt , & Buxton , 2012 ) . 1 . 1 Research Context & Motivation One of the recent and arguably important topics of study in HCI is a design - oriented perspective and the integration of design methods and tools as a complement to existing usability engineering methods . Many researchers have explored different ways of adapting traditional design practices for the design of interactive systems ( Buxton , 2007 ; Greenberg et al . , 2012 ; Kolko , 2010 , 2011 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . Besides all these developments , not only the activities of HCI researchers and designers have changed , but also their tools . Stolterman , Mcatee , Royer , & Thandapani ( 2008 ) for example report an exploratory study investigating the use of “designerly tools” by HCI and Interaction Design practitioners . In their “Tool - in - Use Model” they emphasize that there is a tight relationship between the tool , the activity and the purpose . According to the authors , activities define the use of tools , while at the same time tools may also lead to specific design activities : “When either a simple physical tool or a complex theoretical approach helps a designer to accomplish a purpose , it leads to certain activities . Each tool influences what activities are conducted and through that influences the purpose . ” ( Stolterman et al . , 2008 ) . Hence , the tools used by designers are significant , shaping how design is actually practiced . In their study , the authors also distinguished between two ways of how tools are used and valued in the interaction design process : “Designers in our study Introduction 3 talked about their tools as either supporting them in their design thinking or as a tool that helps them to produce a specific artifact . ” ( Stolterman et al . , 2008 ) . They further found that digital tools like Photoshop are more often used for artifact creation rather than for supporting thinking , while physical tools like whiteboards and pen & paper are preferably used for design thinking and reflection . Similarly , Stappers ( 2005 ) argues that digital tools in their current form are not always beneficial for many creative thought processes : “Whereas current computers are great at dealing with symbolic data , they are only just becoming usable as media machines that can support associative creative processes in the informal and flexible ways that our paper tools could . ” ( Stappers , 2005 ) . He further adds that digital design tools need to support “people’s skills in spatial reasoning , associative thought , overview , empathic thinking , informal discussions and serendipity” in order to be suitable tools for design thinking . However he also notes that despite these concerns , the computer has already replaced many physical design practices , leading to less quality in creative thinking . The increasing use of digital tools , which is inevitable in today’s professional work environments , has thereby replaced many traditional practices that have unique creative benefits that are now no longer practicable ( see Figure 1 . 1 ) . This gap is especially prevalent in HCI , where computers are quite naturally the primary medium for design . As a consequence , a lack of adequate digital tool support may be one critical obstacle in integrating creative design methods into HCI and Interaction Design . In the following sections , this critical gap between design as practiced and current digital design tools will be discussed in more detail as it is the foundation to the empirical part of this thesis . This brief analysis is provided to introduce a framework and the technical background that grounds and relates the research throughout the thesis . It is included in this introduction to provide the reader with enough background for understanding the rationale behind the research reported in each case study . A comprehensive analysis of the research foundations however is provided within Chapters 2 and 3 . 1 . 1 . 1 Thesis Framework As previously argued , many digital design tools lack support for “designerly ways” of externalizing , thinking , collaborating and reflecting as they were mostly designed for individual use and with a focus on constructing artifacts . We may use Figure 1 . 1 ( from Stappers , 2005 ) for contrasting the use of material and digital tools in the design studio and for describing critical gaps between material design practice and desktop - based computer tools . For framing this problem space , four particular themes of design thinking and practice are introduced : “Externalization” , “Reflection” , “Collaboration” and “Process” . These themes will be used as a framework for describing the problem space and the solution space within the proceedings of this thesis . Externalization Externalizing ideas is a key activity of everyday design practice . Designers need to put their ideas into the world in order to reflect on them , to compare them or to be able to communicate them to others . Whether it is in the form of words , sentences , sketches or drawings , different visual depictions are used to engage in a “conversation with materials” ( Schön & Bennett , 1996 ) . In early stages of the design process , these externalizations are preferred to be quick , fluent and informal , as they have the primary purpose of depicting an idea in its current , ill - defined state . It is widely accepted , that material design artifacts are beneficial for this activity ( Buxton , 2007 ; Cook & Bailey , 2005 ; Greenberg et al . , 2012 ; Sellen & Harper , 2003 ) . The rich affordances of paper sketches , sticky notes and paper printouts support designers in rapid externalization . When interacting with material artifacts , the properties of physical representations further allow viewing , gesturing , navigating between and annotating in a simple , quick , fluent and informal way ( see Figure 1 . 1 , a ) . These types of “thinking through doing” interactions ( Klemmer , Hartmann , & Takayama , 2006 ) can also be considered as Research Context & Motivation 4 embodied skills that aid the designer’s cognitive abilities ( Tholander , Karlgren , Ramberg , & Sökjer , 2008 ) . However , when using digital tools , many of these interactions are entirely different or are simply not possible . Externalizing with digital representations currently bounds the designer to specific digital tools that typically do not facilitate or invite embodied forms of expression and thinking ( see Figure 1 . 1 , b ) . Desktop - based tools such as Photoshop or Sketchbook are powerful tools to create visual images that are both compelling and precise – qualities that are more important in later stages of the design process . For initial work , they are however often too formal , requiring the designer to define many different aspects that are not important for the basic purposes of externalization ( Landay & Myers , 2001 ; Landay , 1996a ) . As a result of this lack of support , many designers still prefer simple material such as pen & paper for externalizing their ideas in early design stages ( Cook & Bailey , 2005 ) . Figure 1 . 1 : Traditional material ( a ) and todays digital tools ( b ) in the design studio ( Stappers , 2005 ) . Reflection Another important aspect of design practice is often referred to as “reflection” or “thinking with external representations” ( Kirsh , 2010 ) . Once ideas are externalized , they have their main purpose in “talking back” to the designer or a team of designers ( Buxton , 2007 ) . By leveraging the ability to physically align , juxtapose and compare different artifacts in space , designers harness their spatial thinking abilities for “a reflective conversation with the materials of the design situation” ( Schön , 1983 ) . Being able to group and regroup artifacts in a direct and physical way allows them to identify relations , tensions or analogies between the collected pieces which may lead to both convergence and new insights ( Vyas , Veer , Heylen , & Nijholt , 2009 ) . Or as David Kish puts it : “Reorganizing pieces in physical space makes it possible to examine relations that before were distant or visually complex [ … ] Action and vision have been substituted for imagery , projection , and memory . Physical movement has replaced mental computation . Instead of imagining transformations , we execute them externally . ” ( Kirsh , 2010 ) . Therefore , in creative workspaces such as design studios , artifacts are often displayed in artful arrangements to serve as “vehicles of thought” ( Kirsh , 2010 ; Vyas , Veer , et al . , 2009 ; Vyas , 2009 ) ( see Figure 1 . 1 , a ) . These collages of information and knowledge also save internal memory and computation through their characteristic of persistence that aids remembering , self - assessment , associating and judging ( Kirsh , 2010 ) . When working with digital tools however , representations are created and stored in the digital world rather than in physical space ( see Figure 1 . 1 , b ) . Although this might have other benefits such as the ease of sharing , archiving and retrieval , it also hides artifacts in hierarchies of file systems . Due to the predominant single state document model in desktop - based tools it is also harder to navigate between different artifacts or to compare different artifacts next to each other ( Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . The Introduction 5 main reasons for this are that digital display space typically does not extend into the environment , that it is not persistent , and that it often does not allow for informal and fluent arrangements and rearrangements of artifacts . Digital representations within the WIMP paradigm are often based on lists , grids and icons , concepts that rather limit our embodied cognitive abilities instead of supporting them . As a result of these different qualities of digital and physical artifacts , transformations between these two worlds are quite common . Digital artifacts are frequently printed for being able to display them at whiteboards , while hand drawings on whiteboards are often captured with digital cameras for archiving them in digital repositories . However , frequent transitions make design work more complex than necessary , hampering the overall flow of design knowledge management . Collaboration Designers do hardly work in isolation . Rather , they are typically embedded in a material , social and technical work environment . Material artifacts , display space and spatial arrangements are hence not only important tools for design reflection , but also serve externalization , communication , awareness and collaboration within design teams . In many design studios , dedicated rooms with abundant display space are used for co - located design collaboration ( Vyas , Heylen , & Nijholt , 2008 ; Vyas , 2009 ) . Sharing design ideas or inspirational artifacts in a spatial and informal way invites comments and feedback within the design team ( Greenberg et al . , 2012 ) . Keeping artifacts in a collaborative space can also support serendipity , triggering free associations between knowledge from different design projects . This in turn may lead to new and unexpected insights or ideas . These persistent spatial arrangements are a tool for cooperative thinking and reflection - making common design knowledge and the progress of the design process visible . While these aspects can be considered as supporting awareness , physical design practice also contributes to some benefits in accessibility . The material nature of artifacts invites group interactions like sharing , deictic gesturing and turning or skipping . These simple mechanisms support collaboration , as they make accessing artifacts quick , simple and fluent ( Vyas , Heylen , & Nijholt , 2008 ) . They thereby also assist designers as mediators for implicit communication between stakeholders that are involved in the design process ( Brown , Lindgaard , & Biddle , 2008 ) . By having things observable and in reach , designers are able to use “artifact - mediated communication” ( Boling & Smith , 2008 ) by referencing design knowledge not only verbally , but also with their bodily skills ( Vyas , Heylen , Nijholt , & Veer , 2009a ) . Digital design tools do hardly have comparable collaborative qualities ( see Figure 1 . 1 , b ) . As already claimed , desktop - based tools are not capable of supporting spatial ways of thinking and communication , which limits awareness in a group situation . When working with digital tools on small displays , designers often lack a shared visibility and accessibility to design artifacts which however is essential for group discussions ( Rogers , Lim , Hazlewood , & Marshall , 2009 ) . Desktop - based tools are also primarily designed for individual use , making it hard or impossible for multiple designers to access artifacts simultaneous in a co - located setting . Using multiple computers in creative sessions may further isolate designers behind screens leading to a breakdown of communication that is vital for a shared understanding in the group ( Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , computers also have inherently different and more formal mechanisms of browsing , search and retrieval than informal spatial arrangements . While these are clearly beneficial for dealing with a large amounts of information , they rely on meta - data and naming schemes , aspects that are less important in early design activities ( Sharmin , Bailey , Coats & Hamilton , 2009 ) . As a result of these drawbacks in using digital tools for collaboration , designers often consider computers harmful in their creative group sessions and stick to traditional media instead . Research Context & Motivation 6 Process When designers collaborate on problems and solutions during early design stages , this can potentially lead to more creative ideas and better solutions ( Warr & O’Neill , 2005 ) . However , several studies have shown that groups can only be efficient and productive under the premise that inhibitors are minimized and semi - structured workflows are employed . Social factors like evaluation apprehension , production blocking or free riding have been shown to have dramatic negative effects on a group’s performance in co - located situations ( Lugt , 2001 ; Warr , 2007 ) . Design fixation effects and social dynamics like strong personalities can further harm the quality of group work ( Purcell & Gero , 1996 ) . Consequently , professional practitioners tend to use structured workflows and methods that moderate these hindrances ( Herring , Jones , & Bailey , 2009 ) . In a sense , these workflows harness creativity through reproducible processes . Creative sessions may also be facilitated by a creative professional who directs the group’s activity to the better . The physical nature of design practice thereby allows for a very flexible use of tools and materials that is important for supporting such established workflows . Many collaborative design methods such as affinity diagramming even define and strictly emphasize the use of physical material for facilitating desired group dynamics and social factors ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) . The choice of tools and materials also determines which activities can be performed and vice versa ( Stolterman et al . , 2008 ) . This is also true for digital tools as they enable or disable certain interactions by design . When using digital tools in collaborative design activities , rigid interaction models or formal interaction techniques and modalities may not only influence the spatial and embodied characteristics of thinking and communication , but also the workflow of design methods . Frequently , digital tools are designed without a specific creative methods or techniques in mind , rather as a general purpose solution ( Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . Unfortunately , desktop - based digital design tools often lack the flexibility to make them adaptable to certain situations of use when this was not intended by the designer of the tool . This is for example in contrast to the sticky note as a simple , but versatile design tool that brings certain qualities into many different design situations . Hence , some digital functionality may conflict with established work practices and workflows rendering them useless for collaborative design sessions . As a result , designers regularly consider technology to be harmful in their collaborative work environments and stick to traditional media instead . However , at the same time they give up on potential benefits in using digital media that may complement their workflows , such as ease of documentation , sharing and reuse . 1 . 1 . 2 The Potential of Embodied Interaction Both embodied design practices as well as digital tools have their unique strengths and limitations . Designing new kinds of design tools based on embodied interaction may bring digital tools closer to physical practice and vice versa . Therefore , an integration of computational functionality with the physical , spatial , and social ecology of design practice seems well worth exploring . In the following , some developments in ubiquitous computing will be described that have great potential for filling the described gaps . As proposed in this thesis and examined in detail in Chapter 2 , the critical gap between material design practices and desktop - based digital tools can potentially be bridged with embodied interaction . Therefore , Table 1 . 1 presents the contrast between embodied design practice , digital tools and the potential of embodied interaction concepts . Introduction 7 Table 1 . 1 : Comparing characteristics of design practice with digital tools and the potential of emerging technologies . Embodied Design Practice Desktop - based Digital Tools Embodied Interaction Externalization fluent , flexible and embodied interaction with physical artifacts formal and indirect interaction with digital artifacts fluent and flexible interaction with digital or hybrid artifacts Reflection visible and tangible display of material artifacts in physical space hierarchical archives of digital artifacts in file systems spatial and tangible digital or hybrid design artifacts on digital screens Collaboration shared persistent workspaces facilitate awareness and accessibility isolation behind screens and lack of awareness with digital design artifacts multi - user systems facilitate awareness and accessibility with digital design artifacts Process tools appropriate to workflows and techniques tools replace existing traditional workflows or make methods impossible subtle design of technology as to complement or augment existing workflows From GUI to Tangible and Embodied Interaction Recent technical developments in ubiquitous computing technology introduced more natural ways of interaction with digital or hybrid digital tools . “Computer interfaces that support more natural human forms of communication ( e . g . , handwriting , speech , and gestures ) are beginning to supplement or replace elements of the GUI interaction paradigm” ( Abowd & Mynatt , 2000 ) . New concepts such as “Embodied Interaction” ( Dourish , 2004 ) and “Tangible User Interfaces” ( Ishii & Ullmer , 1997 ) seem especially suited for enhancing creative activities , considering their embodied nature . Designers are now ever more able to use more physical interaction modalities like digital pen tablets , interactive paper or touch interaction that go beyond the strict interaction models of the desktop - based WIMP paradigm . While some of this technology is already available on the mass market , design tools based on these modalities are however again mostly designed for individual use with a focus on creating design artifacts . While these significant advancements clearly augment the theme of “Externalization” – making it more fluent and flexible by simulating or imitating physical characteristics – they are hardly addressing the prevailing problems within the themes “Reflection” , “Collaboration” and “Process” . As a result , bottlenecks are still experienced when digital tools are used in collaborative design processes . From Small Screens to Large Displays As display technology is becoming more affordable , large screens and projections are increasingly available and thus form an important part of the ubiquitous computing ecology ( Bi & Balakrishnan , 2009 ) . Many researchers believe that large screens can be “an effective platform for supporting spatial organization of information , task management , and collaboration” ( Mynatt , Huang , Voida , & Macintyre , 2003 ) . In research , large interactive displays such as interactive whiteboards , interactive surfaces , tabletops , or wall - sized screens are increasingly available . Hence , it may also be valuable to explore the role of digital display space for use in collaborative design activities ( Khan et al . , 2009 ) . Significant advances were also reported in integrating displays into the larger infrastructure , like rooms or furniture for supporting more creative work styles and collaborative sense - making ( Khan et al . , 2009 ; Streitz et al . , 1999 ) . In these systems , large interactive displays are used for presenting , discussing and annotating artifacts during meetings . Thereby , they allow for using digital display space in a similar way as physical display space and thus may be used to augment the “Reflection” and “Collaboration” themes of design practice . However , many efforts have to be put into the design of software tools and interaction concepts , as the traditional WIMP paradigm does not allow direct , Research Context & Motivation 8 informal and fluent interaction for spatially organizing and reorganizing information ( Guimbretière , Stone , & Winograd , 2001 ; Keller , Stappers , & Vroegindeweij , 2004 ) . From Interactive Surfaces to Interactive Spaces The increasing size and availability of digital displays and the emergence of direct and tangible interaction techniques also made computers more suitable for collaboration in work environments . “An assumption of situating large displays in these kinds of settings is that they provide a large interactional space that can support more ‘fluid’ kinds of collaborative interactions . By fluid interaction is meant the easy transition between activities at the interface , such as writing , browsing and drawing ; the smooth switching between individual and group work and the ability to move between display - based and external work . ” ( Rogers & Lindley , 2004 ) . When comparing co - located group work with large displays to desktop - based computer display and mouse interaction , large interactive displays offer more support for switching between tasks and activities , for simultaneous interactions , and for multi - modal input devices ( Rogers & Lindley , 2004 ) . In recent years , the design of such “interactive surfaces” emerged to a major stream in HCI research , drawing the interest of many researchers ( Müller - Tomfelde , 2010 ) . In latest academic research , we have also seen great progress toward “hybrid surfaces” ( Kirk , Sellen , Taylor , Villar , & Izadi , 2009 ) that make simultaneous use of both tangible and digital components . These new generations of collaborative technologies also seem promising for narrowing the gap between physical design practice and digital tool support ( Klemmer , Newman , Farrell , Bilezikjian , & Landay , 2001a ) . Nevertheless , researchers have also started to explore “multi - surface environments” consisting of multiple horizontal or vertical displays that work in concert ( Wigdor , Shen , Forlines , & Balakrishnan , 2006 ) . As small and large displays , as well as horizontal and vertical displays have their unique benefits and drawbacks ( Rogers & Lindley , 2004 ) it seems reasonable to combine these displays into “Interactive Spaces” , new kinds of collaborative environments that are attuned to support both individual and group work . Hence , it might also be valuable to explore the use of interactive spaces for supporting the “Collaboration” theme in design practice . Toward Augmenting Instead of Replacing Eventually , developments in ubiquitous computing have also brought a change of perspective in the way human work is actually supported . Desktop - based systems mostly seek to improve or enhance traditional work practices by replacing them with digital equivalents , requiring the exclusive use of digital modalities ( Weiser , 1999 ) . In his vision of ubiquitous computing , Mark Weiser argued that technologies should take their supportive role into the background and that they better “stay out of the way” to not overburden us ( Weiser , 1999 ) . He further argues that this concept has the potential to “reverse the unhealthy centripetal forces that conventional personal computers have introduced into life and the workplace . ” ( Weiser , 1999 ) . This calm and complimentary role of digital technology also inspired researchers to develop new kinds of frameworks such as “Reality - based Interaction” ( RBI ) ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) for understanding and assisting the design of such systems . By examining tradeoffs between “power” ( computational functionality ) and “reality” ( properties of the “real world” ) it strives toward the goal “to give up reality only explicitly and only in return for increasing power” ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) . HCI researchers have developed such systems most dominantly in the fields of context awareness , ambient intelligence and monitoring or capturing ( Rogers , 2006 ) . These systems thereby seek to augment traditional work practices rather than replacing them . In the context of supporting collaborative design practices , it might also be beneficial to explore the application of unobtrusive monitoring , capturing and documentation techniques for augmenting the “Process” theme . Abowd & Mynatt , ( 2000 ) for example state that “In many collaborative design activities , the critical insights or decisions are often made in informal settings and are usually not documented Introduction 9 properly . ” However they also note that , “there has been little work on capturing artifacts in the physical world and making them easily accessible in the access phase . ” ( Abowd & Mynatt , 2000 ) 1 . 2 Research Question One of the fundamental questions raised in the previous sections is if digital tools can indeed support design thinking and practice and how these tools can be designed in such a way as to be unobtrusive to traditional workflows and methods while at the same time supporting or augmenting practices . Some of these issues have been previously recognized and studied by HCI researchers . However , as will be argued in this thesis , this has not always been entirely successful in a holistic perspective , including all of the previous introduced characteristics of design practice . While there has been considerable progress in supporting externalization and collaboration , many tools and interaction techniques were either designed from a perspective of replacing , without focusing on a holistic system design , without including the spatial characteristics of design thinking and reflection , or without explicitly addressing the influence on traditional methods and workflows ( see section 3 . 1 for more detail ) . Therefore , the following research question ( RQ ) is considered far from being exhaustively answered : RQ : How can we design digital design tools that preserve and augment material and social practices of collaborative design activities ? This thesis takes this research question a driving force to investigate a subtle and careful way of augmenting traditional design practices with technology without influencing them in a negative way . In that sense , the power of digital tools and informal interaction techniques should be used to augment collaborative design activities instead of replacing them with digital tools . By addressing the benefits and limitations of material tools , novel hybrid design tools may emerge that provide unique benefits to designers that go beyond what is possible with physical tools only . By attempting to answer this research question , this thesis seeks to contribute to the research field of HCI in regard to the design of digital tools supporting collaborative design activities that are closer to the social , embodied and material aspects of design practice than traditional desktop - based tools . Therefore , three main research objectives ( RO ) were identified and will be addressed throughout the thesis : RO1 : Devise a design methodology that systematically addresses the proposed research goal of integrating digital functionality with embodied design practices . ( section 3 . 2 ) RO2 : Design and develop new digital tools and interaction techniques to preserve and augment specific collaborative design activities . ( Chapters 4 , 5 , 6 ) RO3 : Evaluate the developed tools as to assess the success of the proposed research . ( Chapter 4 , 5 , 6 ) The accumulation of knowledge gained from investigating these research objectives can then be used to answer the research question in the form of abstract design recommendations ( Chapter 7 ) . 1 . 3 Research Approach & Methodology In order to answer a research question , structured approaches are necessary that guide the researcher in systematically addressing the derived research objectives and to ensure quality and validity of the research findings ( Lazar , Feng , & Hochheiser , 2009 ) . Therefore , a custom research methodology was Research Approach & Methodology 10 developed that specifically cares for the particular research question at hand and that conforms to criteria for evaluating interaction design research within HCI , namely the aspects of Process , Invention , Relevance and Extensibility ( Zimmerman et al . , 2007 ) . Figure 1 . 2 presents an overview of the process and the methods that were applied within this thesis . The overall research process is based on the three steps of analysis , empiricism and abstraction ( see section 1 . 5 ) . Figure 1 . 2 : Overview on the research approach and research methods applied within this thesis . Within analysis , the theoretical and technical foundations to the proposed research are identified and discussed . Because this research is deeply rooted in the application domain and context of design theory and practice , the focus of the analysis is on these aspects . Based on literature reviews on relevant theories and models along with existing field data , this step is applied to both understand and frame the research problem as well as to guide the researcher in examining the state of the art . Both steps contribute to the criteria of Relevance , as “…an extensive literature review must be performed that situates the work and details the aspects that demonstrate how [ the ] contribution advances the current state of the art in the research community” ( Zimmerman et al . , 2007 ) . Hence , as a goal of this thesis is to develop new technical solutions to the application domain , the analysis also includes a review of existing technologies and systems that relate to this work , exploiting opportunities and limitations for further research . The experiences and knowledge gained from the analysis are eventually used for the definition of a design methodology and process for addressing the research goal of integrating digital functionality with material design practices in a structured way ( RO1 ) and that will guide the empirical part of this thesis . Considerable effort was invested into the design of this Process , as “…in documenting their contributions , interaction design researchers must provide enough detail that the process they employed can be reproduced . In addition , they must provide a rationale for their selection of the specific methods employed . ” ( Zimmerman et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , a tradeoff - driven design methodology is employed to make design decisions between preserving and augmenting traditional practices more explicit . In the empirical part of this research , the previously developed design method and process is applied within multiple case studies as to evaluate its appropriateness for designing new digital collaborative design tools and for documenting and describing the rationale that leads to specific design decisions . Three cases in the form of collaborative design activities were selected based on criteria of Relevance to technology theories & models design case case studies research findings literature review literature review guidelines observation design prototyping user studies analysis ( chapters 2 , 3 ) empiricism ( chapters 4 , 5 , 6 ) abstraction ( chapter 7 ) field data literature review Introduction 11 demonstrate “novel integration of various subject matters to address a specific situation . ” ( Zimmerman et al . , 2007 ) . Based on relevance in the “real world” ( Zimmerman et al . , 2007 ) , the cases were also chosen to complement each other , representing typical tasks and activities that are performed in similar variants in many collaborative design processes . For each case , an iterative design process is conducted , including an analysis and observation of traditional practices , conceptual design and prototyping which leads to a holistic system design . An emphasis is put on supporting real workflows with a complete system design rather than designing isolated interaction techniques as one goal of this research is to demonstrate applicability in real - world scenarios . For each case , at least one user evaluation was conducted for reflecting on the design process and to examine the impact of the tools on traditional practices and methods . In all design cases , the investigation is informed by fieldwork and observations of traditional practices . This is in contrast to rather technology - driven research approaches that are predominant in the majority of related research . However , these time - consuming and extensive measures were chosen to fully understand the behaviors , practices and use of material artifacts in a natural setting . The research presented in the empirical part mostly follows a qualitative and explorative orientation as proposed by major researchers in the field of creativity support ( Shneiderman , Fischer , et al . , 2006 ) . This procedure is considered especially suitable for the research at hand , as the goal of this work is not to validate specific theories or frameworks by observing phenomena , but to highlight emerging phenomena that can be further explored for designing technologies . As qualitative approaches may have a lack of validation , the findings from own observations are compared with related fieldwork as to further validate , extend or refute existing knowledge . This and the user studies performed with the developed prototypes contribute to the Invention presented in this research . As with the investigations that informed the design , the developed interaction techniques and tools are also contrasted with findings from related work to validate or refute both qualitative and quantitative findings where applicable . Eventually , in a final step of abstraction , the findings from the different case studies conducted within the empirical part are abstracted and combined , forming guidelines for other researchers that work on similar problems . Thereby , the criterion of Extensibility is emphasized as to highlight the usefulness of the created knowledge for ”…understanding and leveraging the knowledge created by the resulting artifacts” ( Zimmerman et al . , 2007 ) . 1 . 4 Thesis Contributions This thesis disseminates three types of contributions that are relevant to the HCI community : 1 ) methodological , 2 ) technological and 3 ) empirical . Within the methodological contribution , this thesis demonstrates new ways of designing digital tools that are driven by embodied practice and that aim for augmenting instead of replacing traditional work practices . By deriving a design process based on the “Reality - based Interaction” framework ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) and by defining a design methodology based on explicit tradeoff decisions , the methodological design knowledge for domains such as “Ubiquitous Computing” ( Weiser , 1999 ) , “Tangible User Interfaces” ( Ishii & Ullmer , 1997 ) and “Embodied Interaction” ( Dourish , 2004 ) is informed . Besides defining this design process , this thesis also presents multiple case studies on how these methods can be applied within the HCI design activities of analysis , concept development and user evaluation . These descriptions can be used by other researchers for further developing design processes and for designing own digital tools or systems in a variety of different application domains . The methodological contributions are presented in the analytical and empirical part of this work but were also published in a workshop paper ( Geyer & Reiterer , 2011 ) at the premier German HCI Chapter Preview 12 conference “Mensch & Computer” and as part of a full paper ( Geyer , Pfeil , Höchtl , Budzinski , & Reiterer , 2011a ) in the proceedings of the “ACM Conference on Creativity and Cognition” . The main contributions of this thesis however can be described as technological , representing novel holistic system designs and interaction techniques that can be applied to group work , creative activities and for supporting design activities with technology in general . While the system designs as a whole contribute to the goal of supporting “Process” , the various presented interaction techniques fit into the other previously described themes of “Externalization” , “Reflection” and “Collaboration” . The approaches discussed in this work are manifold , ranging from hybrid interaction techniques with digital pen & paper or tangible user interface components over spatial navigation techniques with interactive multi - touch displays and multi - display environments as well as multi - user workspace designs . In isolation as well as in combination , they contribute to the design space of interactive systems in general and to the design of collaborative design tools and creativity support in particular . Using the detailed descriptions in this thesis , other researchers may reproduce and apply the techniques to comparable design problems . The knowledge that may be reused however does not only include the technical descriptions , but also the rationale that led to the particular designs and the understanding about potential benefits or drawbacks that result from the application of the interaction techniques or workspace designs . The technical contributions of this thesis are presented mainly in the empirical part of the thesis and are summarized and abstracted in the concluding part . However , all developed systems and techniques were also published in the proceedings of major national and international HCI conferences such as the “ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems” ( Geyer & Reiterer , 2010 ) , “Mensch & Computer” ( Geyer , Pfeil , Höchtl , Budzinski , & Reiterer , 2011b ) , “Ifip INTERACT” ( Geyer , Pfeil , Budzinski , Höchtl , & Reiterer , 2011 ; Geyer , 2009 ) , the “ACM Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces” ( Geyer , Jetter , Pfeil , & Reiterer , 2010 ; Geyer , Klinkhammer , & Reiterer , 2010 ) , the “ACM Conference on Creativity and Cognition” ( Geyer , Pfeil , Höchtl , et al . , 2011a ) , the “ACM Conference on Designing Interactive Systems” ( Geyer , Budzinski , & Reiterer , 2012a ) and the “Nordic Conference on Human - Computer Interaction” ( Geyer , Budzinski , & Reiterer , 2012b ; Geyer , Höchtl , & Reiterer , 2012 ) . The empirical contribution of this work is to provide new insights into the material nature of collaborative design activities on the one hand and its relation to digital tools on the other hand . Thereby , this thesis contributes findings from own case studies and their relation to existing field data from other researchers . This knowledge , produced mainly through qualitative research methods and transferred with the use of concepts such as tradeoffs and guidelines , originates from observations of traditional practices as well as user studies with prototype design tools . Specific findings from particular case studies on the applicability and influence of proposed interaction techniques on the workflow of design methods can be reused by other researchers working on similar issues . The abstracted findings from the case studies however contribute to a broader understanding of the potential and the limitations of digital tools for supporting material design practices . The specific findings are presented within the empirical part of this thesis , while the abstracted findings are presented in the concluding part of this work . Nevertheless , most specific insights are also discussed in several of the previously listed technical papers and summarized in an article in the “ACM interactions” magazine ( Geyer & Reiterer , 2012 ) . 1 . 5 Chapter Preview This thesis is structured according to the applied research approach ( see Figure 1 . 2 ) , namely analysis ( Chapter 2 , 3 ) , empiricism ( Chapters 4 , 5 , 6 ) and abstraction ( Chapter 7 ) . Introduction 13 Chapter 2 - provides a deeper understanding of the existing theoretical foundations and context this thesis builds upon . By reviewing definitions of design , creativity and collaboration , it sets the scene for further discussions of material and collaborative practices in design and the role of design methods in particular . This includes theoretical foundations of design theory and models for understanding creative design as well as design practice and collaboration . Therefore , field data from observations and analyses of real - world design practices are discussed . In Chapter 3 , previous research in supporting collaborative design activities with technology such as guidelines , frameworks and tools are critically reviewed , also exposing limitations and research gaps . Further , existing design approaches and methodologies that relate to the goal of supporting material practices are explored and then crystalized into a custom design methodology that serves as methodological foundation ( RO1 ) to the main research objectives ( RO2 , RO3 ) . Figure 1 . 3 : Chapter 4 describes a case study on supporting the design method Affinity Diagramming , resulting in the design and evaluation of the design tool “AffinityTable” . Chapter 4 reports a case study of supporting the design technique “Affinity Diagramming” with a hybrid digital workspace . After the choice of this case is justified , the design of the prototype design tool “AffinityTable” is described ( see Figure 1 . 3 ) . Based on the previously devised design methodology , a specific analysis of traditional practices and a conceptual design as well as a prototype implementation were developed ( RO2 ) . The chapter describes the process and experiences of this research , before a user study of the system and its interaction techniques are presented ( RO3 ) . The chapter concludes by discussing technical and empirical contributions along with related work . Figure 1 . 4 : Chapter 5 describes a case study on supporting the design method Brainsketching , resulting in the design and evaluation of the design tool “IdeaVis” . Similarly , Chapter 5 reports a case study on the design and evaluation of a hybrid system supporting the design technique “Brainsketching” ( see Figure 1 . 4 ) . Again , an analysis of traditional practices was Chapter Preview 14 conducted that formed the basis for the developed design tool “IdeaVis” . Similar as with the first case study , this chapter justifies the case selection and presents a system design and prototype implementation ( RO2 ) . Thereafter , knowledge gained from a user study with the system and its interaction techniques is discussed ( RO3 ) . Eventually , technical and empirical contributions of this research are presented in relation to existing work . Figure 1 . 5 : Chapter 6 describes a case study on supporting the specific task of spatially organizing design artifacts , including a comparative and an explorative user study with adapted interaction techniques . Chapter 6 reports an investigation into the specific task of documenting and organizing digital artifacts spatially on interactive surfaces – a topic that emerged as particular important during the previously conducted case studies ( see Figure 1 . 5 ) . Thereby , a detailed exploration of different interaction techniques for spatial organization of design artifacts and new concepts and prototypes for supporting this task are described ( RO2 ) . Then , results from a comparative user study with the techniques “Bubble” and “Bin” as well as an explorative study with the tool “ArtifactBubbles” in the context of design process documentation and reflection activities are discussed ( RO3 ) . Again , the technical and empirical findings are contrasted with existing research for summarizing the contributions of this work . Finally Chapter 7 concludes the thesis by reflecting and synthesizing the knowledge formed during the different case studies . It also includes a summary of contributions which leads to a further discussion of the limitations of this work , specific guidelines for design and a vision of future research directions .

This is crucial to the research at hand as assumptions and requirements in this work are derived from an understanding of particular characteristics of design activities , design methods and design practice . Therefore , a literature review is given concerning existing theoretical knowledge on the notions of design , the design process , design methods and creativity in design . Further , a review concerning the practical aspects of design is provided by describing and referencing existing field data on how designers actually work in embodied practice . Within this review , the cognitive , social , material and bodily aspects of design activities and their relation to design methods and design environments are discussed as they are a major foundation to the research goals and objectives within this thesis . As 2 Theoretical Foundations 18 will be shown in the proceedings of this chapter , it is crucial to provide a well - defined understanding of the notion of design and the design process as its conceptions and views are quite diverse . 2 . 1 Theoretical Foundations Design as a discipline and science has been studied since the 1950s ( Atwood , McCain , & Williams , 2002 ) . However , formal descriptions of design theories and design methodology have only emerged during the last few decades . As Atwood et al . ( 2002 ) note , the technological growth and industrialization of the modern world introduced a complexity that encouraged researchers in defining and conceptualizing Design and its effects on people , the society and products . Since then , design researchers have studied Design for developing new understandings for practicing and teaching . Pioneering works that defined the field of design research and teaching include “Notes on the Synthesis of Form” ( Alexander , 1964 ) , “The Science of the Artificial” ( Simon , 1969 ) , “The Reflective Practitioner” ( Schön , 1983 ) and “Developments in Design Methodology” ( Cross , 1984 ) . Nevertheless , many other views and conceptualizations of design methodology have emerged since then . 2 . 1 . 1 Design A fundamental question one may ask in the very beginning is for a formal definition of Design . However , an extensive literature review conducted by Atwood et al . , ( 2002 ) revealed that “there is no single , universally accepted , concise definition of design” . This has several reasons as will be argued in the following . One may begin by noting that the very word “Design” is both a noun and a verb . Thus , it may refer to an end product or to a process . In the proceedings of this chapter , it will be referred to primarily as a process . Further , it should be mentioned that difficulties in understanding Design also emerge from its use in other languages than English . For example , “Design” as a word is rather vague in many European languages as it may cover both the process of planning products and systems as well as the process of “formgiving” ( German : “Gestaltung” ) ( Koskinen , Zimmerman , Binder , Redström , & Wensveen , 2011 ) . While the latter is very restrictive , focusing on the “form” only , the former is more open and may cover anything that is created by humans such as airplanes , machines , software or even food . When for example considering the use of the word “Design” in the German language , many people tend to refer to the form only , referring to the superficial looks , style and aesthetics rather than the actual workings of a product ( German : “Formgebung” ) . However , within this thesis , Design is considered as an approach to problem solving and creativity rather than to form - giving only . Views of design in the literature also focus on the understanding of design as a process . However , as there is no such thing as a single design discipline or design profession , views differ based on the background and traditions of a variety of disciplines . Disciplines that refer to Design are quite diverse such as Arts , Architecture , Fashion Design , Game Design , Graphic Design , Industrial Design , Interaction Design , Interior Design , Landscape Design , Product Design , Process Design , Engineering Design and Service Design ( Koskinen et al . , 2011 ) . However , considering the most prominent and most cited literature in the field , Architecture and Engineering Design are the most centrally placed disciplines in this spectrum . As Lawson ( 2005 ) notes , they are the most studied and most written about . Recently however , Industrial Design and Interaction Design are among the most influential disciplines concerning a modern understanding of a methodology termed “Design Thinking” . While Design is considered different in various contexts , researchers however agree that it can be seen as a generic activity with certain characteristics that span different disciplines and Analysis 19 traditions ( Lawson , 2005 ) . Table 2 . 1 presents commonly cited definitions by influential authors in design theory ( compiled from Atwood et al . , 2002 ; Jones , 1992 ; Ralph & Wand , 2009 ; Warr , 2007 ) .

Many researchers hence agree that design is a process or action ( Ehn , 1990 ; Gero , 1990 ; Jones , 1992 ; Ralph & Wand , 2009 ; Schön , 1983 ) performed by one or more human being ( Ehn , 1990 ; Ralph & Wand , 2009 ) that involves certain activities toward a goal ( Gero , 1990 ; Nunamaker et al . , 1991 ; Ralph & Wand , 2009 ; Simon , 1969 ) . Further , some researchers agree that design involves a product or solution to a given problem ( Ralph & Wand , 2009 ; Rittel , 1984 ) . Nevertheless , it is also argued that these solutions or products are novel or refined and serve a particular purpose ( Alexander , 1964 ; Fallman , 2003 ; Jones , 1992 ) . To summarize , for the purpose of defining the notion of Design within this thesis following characterization is put forward : “Design involves a designer or a team of designers that engage Theoretical Foundations 20 in a process to produce a novel or refined product which serves a particular purpose ” . As this definition is still quite abstract and ambiguous , the next sections will provide a deeper understanding of important characteristics of design as perceived and conceptualized in the fields of HCI and Interaction Design . 2 . 1 . 2 Design in HCI The term Design in HCI is often used very broadly to refer to the entire development process of interactive systems such as a “system design lifecycle” or an “interaction design process” ( Hartson & Pyla , 2012 ) . However , it is also used more narrowly to denote the “creative human activity by which new ideas are synthesized and put together to make up parts of an interaction design” ( Hartson & Pyla , 2012 , p . 251 ) , which is in fact only one part of the entire lifecycle . In this narrow context , practitioners and researchers in the field of HCI engage in design to produce digital or physical artifacts such as interactive systems or interaction techniques either as a vehicle for prototyping or for producing and deploying real - world systems ( Fallman , 2003 ) . In that sense , the term design would explicitly exclude analysis and evaluation . As Hartson & Pyla ( 2012 ) argue , there is no real path out of this ambiguity of terminologies . Rather the authors propose to “follow the loose conventions of the field and use ‘design’ with both narrow and broad meanings , hoping that context will provide clarity” ( Hartson & Pyla , 2012 , p . 252 ) . This thesis follows this proposal , attempting to provide context where necessary . The notion of Design in HCI is also often associated with a particular way of thinking , or “Design Thinking” . Design as a way of thinking can be traced back to the early works of Simon ( 1969 ) and McKim ( 1972 ) . The term “Design Thinking” however was introduced by Rowe ( Rowe , 1991 ) and Buchanan ( Buchanan , 1992 ) . Recently the term was also made popular for business purposes by David Kelley of the company IDEO 1 and is used for teaching design cognition at universities such as Stanford’s d . school or the HPI ( Hasso Plattner Institute ) 2 . Although a buzzword in the business world , it is now also used by design researchers such as Lawson ( Lawson & Dorst , 2009 ) and Cross ( Cross , 2011 ) . An underlying assumption of the recent interest in design thinking is that its strategies may be applied to a wide range of other fields such as business or engineering . As Fallman and many other scholars ( Buxton , 2007 ; Harrison , Tatar , & Sengers , 2007 ; Hartson & Pyla , 2012 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Löwgren , 1995 ; Rogers , 2004 ; Stolterman , 2008 ; Winograd , 1996 ; Zimmerman et al . , 2007 ) argue , HCI has witnessed a dramatic shift in perspective over the last years toward a “design - oriented field of research” ( Fallman , 2003 ) that is strongly influenced by traditional design methodologies . In the following , these developments will be described in more detail . According to Winograd ( Winograd , 1997 ) , HCI has initially emerged as a classical engineering discipline . Computers and the user interface were considered as machines that needed to be engineered to make them usable to humans . In the 1970s and 1980s when the personal computer ( PC ) and the graphical user interface ( GUI ) emerged , the field of User Interface Design ( UID ) was established . Researchers and practitioners within this discipline predominantly had backgrounds in Computer Science , Ergonomics or Cognitive Science and were mainly concerned about the adequate design of interface components and their structure toward a system design that conforms to certain Usability Principles ( Shneiderman , 1992 ) . The term Usability Engineering ( UE ) ( Nielsen , 1993 ) is still used broadly to refer to this evaluation - centric methodology . Within the 1990s however , interaction modalities and interface types were growing more diverse , covering not only desktop computers , but also mobile computing and ubiquitous network access ( Winograd , 1997 ) . Due to the growing 1 http : / / www . ideo . com 2 http : / / www . hpi . uni - potsdam . de Analysis 21 complexity of the potential design space and newly introduced dynamics , the field grew more interdisciplinary including many more perspectives and more creative and generative approaches . This novel viewpoint of moving beyond the interface of a desktop PC toward the design of more general interactions between humans and digital artifacts was broadly termed Interaction Design ( IXD ) ( Moggridge , 2007 ; Winograd , 1997 ) . Similar to the design of graphical user interfaces , methodologies were introduced that respected the need for usable and efficient computing systems in complex infrastructures and ecologies ( Preece et al . , 2007 ) . Within the last ten years however , the field of HCI was again extended by a novel perspective on designing not only products or systems but toward designing experiences . The term User - Experience Design ( UXD ) is used to refer to the perspective that the focus of design is not merely on interactions or the interface , but on all aspects of an interactive product or service as experienced by the user ( Buxton , 2007 ; Hassenzahl , 2010 ) . This may include not only the workings , aesthetics and looks of a designed artifact , but also the subjective emotions , feelings and perceptions the user may experience with the product , service or brand ( Hartson & Pyla , 2012 ) . Today there is a vast range of design methods , paradigms and philosophies in HCI practice and research . However , the most prominent currents are called User - Centered Design ( UCD ) or Human - Centered Design ( HCD ) and Participatory Design ( PD ) ( Rogers et al . , 2011 ) . While PD involves actual users in the design process as more or less equal partners to the system designers , UCD and HCD do not involve the user in the design process as partners , but as a source of information on needs and requirements during analysis and evaluation . Both approaches therefore share a focus on the user . However , they differ in the degree of user involvement concerning the actual activity of creating design solutions . As a result of the above described developments from “object - centered” engineering of interactive systems toward “experience - centered” design of interactive products and services ( Buxton , 2007 ) , the field radically grew more diverse and more complex . Within the initial engineering perspective of HCI , practitioners and researchers could rely on scientific methods , metrics and cyclic processes for the design of interfaces . By measuring well - defined usability goals such as performance and efficiency , structured processes and methods could be applied in a scientific manner . However , as Winograd ( Winograd , 1996 ) argues , today’s tradeoffs in HCI cannot always be measured and quantified as they also relate to subjective aspects such as human needs , emotions , desires and values . Designers thus have to face a new kind of complexity . Stolterman defines this as “the complexity a designer experiences when faced with a design situation” ( Stolterman , 2008 , p . 57 ) . In today’s HCI practice , this complexity is determined by the potential “infinite and limitless sources” of information , requirements , limitations and opportunities a designer may experience in the design of interactive products : “The designer has to make all kinds of decisions and judgments , such as , how to frame the situation , who to listen to , what to pay attention to , what to dismiss , and how to explore , extract , recognize , and chose useful information from all of these potential sources” ( Stolterman , 2008 , p . 57 ) . These circumstances hamper the application of engineering methodologies as these typically require well - defined problems and solution paths . Consequently , HCI has increasingly adopted “designerly” methodologies that are much more suitable for such “messy” ( Schön , 1983 ) design situations and “wicked” ( Rittel , 1984 ) or “ill - defined” ( Lawson , 2005 ) design problems . Li et al . ( 2007 ) even argue that a 3 rd paradigm of thinking about design in HCI has emerged , following the Engineering paradigm and the Cognitive Science paradigm . The authors however note that these paradigms are not mutually exclusive ; rather they do overlap and complement each other . As a final remark , one may mention that the previous descriptions are clearly based on an HCI perspective . Recently , design theory researchers argued that Interaction Design can be also be seen from a Design perspective ( Blevis & Stolterman , 2009 ) . As the boundaries between Product Design Theoretical Foundations 22 or Industrial Design and HCI are becoming more and more blurred , this may lead to rather fundamental discussions about the potential future developments in this area of research ( Harrison et al . , 2007 ; Koskinen et al . , 2011 ; Löwgren , 2002 ) . 2 . 1 . 3 Design Problems In the following , Design as a way of solving problems is described based on the empirical research and literature reviews made by design researchers such as Cross ( Cross , 1996 , 2007 ) and Lawson ( Lawson , 2005 ) . These works commonly regard the nature and complexity of design problems as one of the main foundations to Design . By observing and analyzing designers and design activities , researchers found that many design problems cannot be understood in a comprehensive way . This is because “design problems and design solutions are inexorably interdependent . [ … ] In design , problems may suggest certain features of solutions but these solutions in turn create new and different problems” ( Lawson , 2005 ) . These design problems are considered “ill - defined” ( Schön , 1983 ) or “wicked” ( Rittel , 1984 ) as there are no well - defined evaluation criteria for when a design problem is solved ( Simon , 1969 ) . Rittel defines wicked problems with ten properties ( Rittel , 1984 ) : 1 ) Wicked problems have no definitive formulation , but every formulation of a wicked problem corresponds to the formulation of a solution . 2 ) Wicked problems have no stopping rules . 3 ) Solutions to wicked problems cannot be true or false , only good or bad . 4 ) In solving wicked problems there is no exhaustive list of admissible operations . 5 ) For every wicked problem there is always more than one possible explanation , with explanations depending on the Weltanschauung of the designer . 6 ) Every wicked problem is a symptom of another , " higher level , " problem . 7 ) No formulation and solution of a wicked problem has a definitive test . 8 ) Solving a wicked problem is a " one shot " operation , with no room for trial and error . 9 ) Every wicked problem is unique . 10 ) The wicked problem solver has no right to be wrong - they are fully responsible for their actions . While this list describes the reality found when observing designers , it does not give an answer why design problems are wicked . Buchanan et al . however argue that design problems are wicked because of the subjective subject matter of design , which is potentially universal in scope as it may relate to any area of human experience ( Buchanan , 1992 ) . Thus , a designer needs to “discover or invent a particular subject out of the problems and issues of specific circumstances” ( Buchanan , 1992 ) . Consequently , one of the most important steps in solving a design problem is the exploration and structuring of the “problem space” and the “solution space” . As Cross ( 2007 ) notes , designers develop problems and solutions at the same time , while their attention oscillates between the two spaces . This however requires subjective interpretation by the designer . As the understanding of design problems depends on the ideas of solving them , different designers are likely to devise different solutions based on their subjective perception of the design situation ( Lawson , 2005 ) . Hence , formulating or “framing” ( Schön , 1983 ) design problems is frequently identified as a key feature of design activities ( Cross , 2007 ) . Researchers further observed that design problems are often hierarchically organized . As Lawson ( 2005 ) argues , many design problems can be seen as symptoms of higher - level problems and that there is no logical way of determining the right level on which to approach these problems in a holistic way The ill - defined nature of design problems also determines the characteristics of design solutions . As design problems cannot be comprehensively stated , there are an inexhaustible number of different Analysis 23 solutions . This is in contrast to engineering methodology , where a range of possible solutions can be mapped out according to particular properties of problem specifications ( Lawson , 2005 ) . This in turn implies that there cannot be optimal solutions to a design problem and that design is therefore endless and open - ended as there is not stopping rule . As design problems may stand in conflict with each other , a designer cannot optimize a requirement without sacrificing some losses elsewhere . Subjective judgment therefore again determines the tradeoffs and compromises made during the evolution of the solution space . As Lawson notes , this also makes design solutions vulnerable to critique : “Design solutions can never be perfect and are often more easily criticised than created , and designers must accept that they will almost invariably appear wrong in some ways to some people” ( Lawson , 2005 ) . The above described characteristics of design problems further control how designers approach the generation of solutions . Cross ( 2007 ) states that many designers do not spend much time on defining design problems as they are aware of their ill - defined nature . Rather , they tend to be solution - focused instead of problem - focused and often rely on education and experience in a specific domain to quickly frame a problem and for proposing a solution . This “ill - behaved” or “undisciplined” behavior is also regarded as one of the weaknesses of design cognition as it may lead to fixation and to the attachment to earlier concepts ( Cross , 2007 ) . Researchers hence observed “fixation” effects where designers were reluctant to consider all relevant knowledge and experience that should be brought into a problem framing and for exploring new solutions but were instead reusing features of known existing designs ( Purcell & Gero , 1996 ) . This in turn may inevitable lead to less innovative solutions . However , it seems that fixation is an issue that is rather common for novice designers as researchers have also found that fixation does not necessarily have negative effects with highly experienced individuals as these may also find a novel problem frame that fits their fixation ( Cross , 2007 ) . Another form of fixation has been identified not only for external concepts and design examples , but with earlier concepts that were developed by the designers themselves . While designers were found to change their strategies between problem setting and solution generation , they tend to stick to initial design solutions as long as possible even when difficulties and deficiencies of the solution in relation to a new problem framing are apparent ( Rowe , 1991 ) . Researchers explain this behavior with the difficulty in discarding an earlier solution that was previously considered satisfactory . Instead , designers tend to improve their existing solutions with much effort until a workable , but less satisfying solution is reached ( Cross , 2007 ) . This also leads toward the exploration of less alternative solutions , which may reduce the chance of finding a more appropriate solution . However , it is to mention here that the number of alternative solution concepts ( degree of divergence ) is not a measure for a particular strong design strategy as it was shown that in the case of an “excessive expansion” of the problem and solution spaces , designers are forced to spend much time on managing and organizing the set of alternatives and modifications ( degree of convergence ) . Hence , a reasonable restriction of the search space seems adequate ( Cross , 2007 ) . To summarize , design problems and solutions define many characteristics of design such as its open - ended nature , the problem space and the solution space , framing activities , subjective judgment , tradeoffs , critique , fixation and attachment to concepts as well as the generation of alternatives . In the following , the particular strategies for coping with these properties in a structured process are discussed . 2 . 1 . 4 Design Process The characteristics of ill - defined problems may lead to three essential activities : 1 ) analyzing and understanding a problem , 2 ) synthesizing a solution and 3 ) evaluating the relation between problem and solution ( Alexander , 1964 ; Cross , 2007 ; Jones , 1992 ; Lawson & Dorst , 2009 ; Lawson , 2005 ) . While most researchers agree on the necessity of these three activities , there are different perceptions on Theoretical Foundations 24 how these are approached as a process . Fallman describes three accounts of what “designers really ‘do’ when they design” : the conservative account , the romantic account , and the pragmatic account ( Fallman , 2003 ) . According to the author’s description of the conservative account , the design process can be seen as a linear progression from the problem to the solution which is accomplished through a series of “well - described , discrete , rational , and structured methodological steps” ( Fallman , 2003 , p . 226 ) . Indeed , Alexander ( 1964 ) and Jones ( 1992 ) describe a linear process with discrete steps such as breaking the problem into pieces ( analysis ) , putting the pieces together in a new way ( synthesis ) and testing the consequences in practice ( evaluation ) . Jones ( 1992 ) further proposed concrete design methods for these steps as a way of structuring this process into techniques and procedures that can be followed by designers in a generic way . By specifying general guidelines and the order in which activities should be performed , the design process is conceptualized as a controlled and logical procedure , such as that of an engineer or scientist ( Fallman , 2003 ) . While the conservative account is well suited to describe the design process in a rational way , it reduces the role of the designer to that of a rule - following engineer without subjective judgment and creativity . In contrast to the conservative account however , the romantic account emphasizes the role of the designer as a “mastermind” and personality . Rather than abstract reasoning and rational problem solving , romanticism values the individual human capabilities such as imagination and creativity ( Fallman , 2003 ) . As such , the romantic account suggests that the designer should be compared to an artist rather than to a scientist and that creativity is valued over methodology . As a result , the design process is not led by predetermined steps or activities , rather by the designer’s subjective values and taste only . This in turn makes the design process rather mythical , as the designer is considered to have the ability to create innovative designs but may not be able to or might not be interested in explaining his thought processes ( Fallman , 2003 ) . Eventually , the pragmatic account considers design as an engagement in a specific situation . Pragmatism refers to the existing knowledge of everyday life and work and the spontaneous intuitive actions that are prompted by that knowledge . Rather than relying on theories and methodologies as a guiding principle , pragmatists rely on experience , knowledge and intuition . This account therefore cares for real - world situations where design is always carried out in a situation “with people , artifacts and practices , each with their own histories , identities , goals and plans” ( Fallman , 2003 ) . Rather than a systematic process as in the conservative account and also unlike the mythical process of the romantic account , the pragmatic account takes the form of an individual interpretation of meaning and effects that result from design solutions in a particular situation – or as Schön calls it : “a reflective conversation with the materials of the design situation” ( Schön , 1992 ) . The designer therefore works with the concrete tools and materials that are available in a design situation , but seeks to determine and redefine their roles by engaging in a dialogue with them ( Fallman , 2003 ) . This concept of “reflection - in - action [ … ] is central to the ‘art’ by which practitioners sometime deal well with situations of uncertainty , instability , uniqueness , and value conflict” ( Schön , 1983 , p . 50 ) . By reflecting - in - action , the designer is continually reflecting on the current understanding of the problem and the validity of the emergent solutions ( Lawson , 2005 ) . With “reflection - on - action” , Schön ( 1983 ) also describes reflection as a higher level activity in which not only actions are being monitored by the designer but also the process . By asking if the overall process is going well and by “standing back” from the tasks at hand , the designer might find problems or solutions that were previously not found or that were neglected . However , as Lawson notes “knowing when to reflect on actions , and how , may be one of the most important skills a designer may possess” ( Lawson , 2005 ) . Analysis 25 The design process hence can be seen from different perspectives . Yet , the previously presented accounts hint toward the perception of the design process as in - between engineering on the one hand and the arts on the other hand . Despite the limits in understanding design as a transparent process and criticism toward structured design methods , the engineering - oriented three - stage model of analysis , synthesis and evaluation dominates the fields of architecture , industrial design , interaction design , HCI and many other design disciplines ( Fallman , 2003 ) . However , “second generation” design methods were introduced to care for the creative , individual and collaborative nature of design work . Further , processes were extended by including the concept of iteration . By giving designers the freedom to move freely between all stages of the design process , the problem of co - evolution of problem and solution and the open - ended nature of design is taken care of . Yet , as Gedenryd ( 1998 ) argues , the idea of adding iteration to a structured process is contradicting in itself as it effectively means that several activities of the design process are inseparable and intertwined . Hence , the notion of a conversation or a dialog between problems and solutions or partial solutions might be more suitable for describing design processes than an iterative progression from abstract to concrete ( Fallman , 2003 ) . Figure 2 . 1 : Author ' s depiction of the design process ( Buxton , 2007 ; Fallman , 2003 ; Lawson & Dorst , 2009 ; Lawson , 2005 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Roozenburg & Eekles , 1991 ; Schön , 1983 ) . For the purpose of defining the characteristics of design processes as referenced throughout this thesis , Figure 2 . 1 depicts a model of the author’s interpretation of the design process . Based on other models and descriptions of the design process ( Buxton , 2007 ; Lawson & Dorst , 2009 ; Lawson , 2005 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Roozenburg & Eekles , 1991 ) and the previous described characteristics of design methodology , three basic phases or steps can be identified : analysis , synthesis and evaluation . These three steps are considered to be non - sequential in nature , rather moving between the two limits of a design problem ( depicted by a question mark ) and a design solution ( exclamation mark ) in an open - ended way . They are approached in a highly iterative manner , whereby the designer may frequently switch modes ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! analysis synthesis evaluation exploration synthesis simulation reflection elaboration reduction clarification resolution divergence convergence generation refinement problem space solution space Theoretical Foundations 26 between action and reflection and activities in a rapid and conversational way . Further , the three steps of the design process are situated between a problem space and a solution space . Within each space , divergent and convergent activities may be performed ( indicated by funnels ) . Within divergent activities in the problem space , exploration and elaboration of the problem setting generates new information , thus increasing the available opportunities . The second part of synthesis hence starts with convergent activities , putting pieces of problems together in a new way , thereby reducing the complexity of the design problem . At the same time however , the synthesis step generates a new situation , which will be further explored toward a solution . Again , divergent activities in the form of generating and externalizing partial design solutions are performed , opening up the solution space . Partial solutions in turn have to be assembled to a holistic answer to the design problem . Accordingly , the process includes a further convergence in the solution space . Although the depiction of the process tends to reflect the conservative account of design , it also respects that subjective judgments , creativity and individual real - world knowledge and rationality are brought into the process within all divergent and convergent activities . 2 . 1 . 5 Creativity in Design The subjective skills of designers play an important role in the romantic and pragmatic accounts of the design process . In design theory , this talent is often referred to as “creativity” ( Cross , 2007 ; Lawson , 2005 ) or “design ability” ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . Creativity has been studied intensively within the last decades . Although there is an extensive body of literature by philosophers , cognitive scientists and computer scientists , it still remains a rather abstract and vague concept ( Lawson , 2005 ) . This may be due to the fact that some theories include unconscious thoughts processes that remain mysterious . Most insights and findings on creativity originate from the study of the cognitive processes , work and the personal reflections of outstanding and famous thinkers or creators rather than from the investigation of a broad population . Definitions of creativity most frequently focus on the cognitive process of being creative , on the creative personality , or the creative product ( Lawson , 2005 ) . Early descriptions of the creative thought process have been proposed by Wallas ( 1926 ) and Osborn ( 1953 ) . Wallas for example describes four phases that occur in creative thinking : 1 ) preparation , 2 ) incubation , 3 ) illumination and 4 ) verification ( Wallas , 1926 ) . Preparation is described as a step of gathering relevant information that may relate to a particular problem , while in incubation , the problem is no longer considered consciously but rather as an ambient thought . Illumination then describes a creative insight , an action that suddenly brings forward an idea . Verification eventually considers the appropriateness of the idea as an adequate solution . Osborn’s definition moved away from unconscious phases by describing only two phases : idea generation and idea evaluation , while idea generation is split in the two parts of fact finding and idea finding ( Osborn , 1953 ) . Fact finding thereby describes the activity of problem definition , while idea finding is described as a process of combining old ideas into new ideas . Again , as in the model proposed by Wallas ( 1926 ) , the step of idea evaluation considers the suitability of the produced ideas . Osborne’s method “brainstorming” that was derived from this process model , is one of the most cited , most applied and most appropriated methods in creative problem solving ( Jones , 1992 ) . More recent research such as that of Boden ( 1996 ) however defines the creative thought process as “the exploration and transformation of conceptual spaces” . Thereby , a conceptual space is a bundle of knowledge which can be connected to other bundles of knowledge via associations . Hence , exploration is the activity of recalling these bundles , while transformation is the association of existing bundles to a conceptual space . According to Boden , the exploration is initiated by a stimulus that is perceived either consciously or unconsciously ( Boden , 1996 ) . The process of transformation then occurs when two or more knowledge bundles are applied to a potential solution in a new domain . The transformations hence Analysis 27 form to a new idea that previously was not there . A transformation of seemingly very distant bundles of knowledge to one conceptual space is considered especially creative . Researchers often describe the unconscious perception of these transformations as an “Eureka” moment or a “creative leap” – a sudden revelation that brings about exceptionally concepts ( Sternberg , 1998 ) . Sternberg ( 1998 ) however found that in most cases , creativity is the result of conscious efforts involving encoding , selecting and comparing existing knowledge in a laborious way . Besides these most influential models of the creative process , many other representations have emerged that however share many of the above described attributes ( Shneiderman , 2003 ) . As an internal thought process , creativity is also considered a part of the personality . Psychologists have studied exceptionally creative persons to find out about their particular traits and character as they seemed to be naturally more creative than others . Some of the results were that creative scientists for example are “very intelligent , but also persistent and highly motivated , self - sufficient , confident and assertive” ( Lawson , 2005 ) . This is consistent with many other studies that found that intelligence plays a key role in creativity . However , researchers also found that intelligent people are not naturally creative . Instead , the differences between intelligent and creative persons have been identified as a tendency to excel in convergent or divergent thinking ( Lawson , 2005 ) . Divergent thinking hence allows exploring more knowledge bundles , while convergent thinking enables the creative person to create more transformations . As a result , the chances for new and innovative ideas are much higher . In terms of the design process , creative individuals are also less prone to fixation effects or attachment to concepts as they tend to develop more frames of design problems and execute more design moves ( Cross , 2007 ) . A popular tendency however is to regard divergence as the core creative skill rather than the interplay of divergence and convergence ( Lawson , 2005 ) . Löwgren and Stolterman note that “nearly every situation requires analytical skill from the designer . At the same time , the designer needs to be creative [ … ] One of the connections is that both skills require an imaginative mind” ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 , p . 51 ) . Hence , creativity within the design process may be regarded as the designer’s ability to generate ideas that are relevant , appropriate , and capable of being realized , and new and innovative at the same time ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 , p . 52 ) . Eventually , notions of creativity are also depended on what “innovative” and “creative” actually means when referring to the outcome of a design process . Researchers have thus studied the creative product by labeling its characteristics . A creative process is only described as such if the outcome is considered “appropriate” or “novel” ( Boden , 1996 ) . Novelty thereby relates to the unusualness of a design solution based on a comparison of the product with other products of the same class . Differences between products can be seen in aesthetics , surprise and satisfaction as perceived by an observer . Boden ( 1996 ) however notes that novelty is either psychological or historical . Psychological novelty relates only to the individual mind it arose , while an idea is historically novel if no one has ever thought of it before . Similar to novelty , appropriateness also depends on the context it is perceived in , as appropriation is subjective and highly dependent on the context of use . If a product is of value for a particular situation is further dependent on the culture and subjective values an observer might have ( Boden , 1996 ) . As a result , designers need to understand novelty and appropriateness in their particular context before they can be truly creative : “One of the paradoxes of creativity is that , in order to think originally , we must familiarise ourselves with the ideas of others . . . These ideas can then form a springboard from which the creator ' s ideas can be launched” ( Lawson , 2005 ) . As a psychological phenomenon and way of thinking , creativity is relevant to design as it determines how effective a designer may engage in divergent and convergent activities within both the problem space and the solution space . Descriptions of the creative thought process have a clear analogy with models of the design process , such as the basic steps of 1 ) analysis which corresponds to preparation ( Wallas , Theoretical Foundations 28 1926 ) or fact finding ( Osborn , 1953 ) , 2 ) synthesis which resembles idea finding ( Osborn , 1953 ) or illumination ( Wallas , 1926 ) and 3 ) evaluation which is similar to idea evaluation ( Osborn , 1953 ) or verification ( Wallas , 1926 ) . Further , the inclusion of unconscious thoughts is similar to the romantic account as described by Fallman ( 2003 ) , while more conscious processes are in line with the conservative account of design ( Warr , 2007 ) . Although researchers cannot reliably state if creativity is something that people are born with or if it is something that is being learnt , design education focuses on making designers aware of previous work and to encourage them to freely engage in open - ended expansions ( Lawson , 2005 ) . Designers may also benefit from circumstances that stimulate motivation , free exploration and immersion into a design activity . Csikszentmihalyi ( 1997 ) describes a phenomenon called “flow” which is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed , focused and energized in an activity . In flow , positive emotions like joy energize a person in a way that results in fully focused attention on the activity itself without consciously being aware of one self’s emotions . Although Csikszentmihalyi describes flow as a mood or feeling , he also argues that the design environment and the design tools may be designed in a way to stimulate or at least not break the chances of designers achieving flow ( see section 2 . 2 . 3 and section 3 . 1 . 2 ) ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) . 2 . 1 . 6 Collaboration in Design So far , design and creativity have been considered as an individual and rather personal or cognitive process . Indeed much existing research has focused on creative design activities of individuals ( Amabile , 1996 ) . However , as many scholars state , this is rarely the case in design practice . Both , creativity researchers ( Amabile , 1996 ; Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ; Mamykina , Candy , & Edmonds , 2002 ; Osborn , 1953 ) as well as design researchers ( Cross , 2007 , 2011 ; Fischer , 2004 ; Lawson , 2005 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Shneiderman , 2003 ) emphasize the social nature of creative design activities . As Fischer ( 2004 ) argues , modern design problems are increasingly complex , which requires more knowledge than an individual designer can possess . Csikszentmihalyi ( 1997 ) even argues that much of our creativity emerges from interactions and collaborations with other individuals . More general theoretical frameworks on group work such as “distributed cognition” ( Hutchins , 1996 ) also move away from the individual mind as a source of cognition , but rather include the interactions with other people and the environment as a fundament to cognitive processes . Hence , communication and collaboration of multiple designers or teams of designers seems inevitable ( Warr , 2007 ) . As a result for the need of collaboration in creative activities and design thinking , actual design work does not happen in isolation , but is rather embedded into social environments , organizations or communities . Fischer ( 2004 ) states that design is also interdisciplinary , as designers from different backgrounds are needed to accomplish large scale design projects . In such projects , stakeholders from different communities and backgrounds may work together as a team . The author thereby differentiate between Communities of Practice ( CoP ) , which are groups that share the same background and knowledge and Communities of Interest ( CoI ) , which are groups that share the same goal but bring together expertise from different CoP . For example , for the design of a new computer system that is being used in a particular work environment , the end users have domain expertise in the work place , while the designers are proficient with the adequate technologies that might be used to support that work practice . In joining a CoI , both CoP work together toward a shared goal , such as the development of a system to support the end user’s work . Hence , both CoP have to reach a common understanding regarding the design problem and the design solutions as a prerequisite of collaboration . Collaboration in design can happen in different scales and levels , such as organizational , in teams or in groups . Paulus defines design groups as “two or more individuals who have some interdependence Analysis 29 or relationship and who have an influence on each other through their interactions“ ( Paulus , 2000 , p . 238 ) , while teams are defined as groups that work together for a common goal in an organization . Collaboration can however also happen on the organizational level between different teams in organizations or across different organizations . Fischer ( 2004 ) notes that characteristics are inherently different depending on the scale of collaboration . Cross - organizational collaboration is often temporally and spatially distributed . Within groups and teams however , sharing design knowledge is a rather ad - hoc and short term process , while sharing design knowledge on the organizational level requires “organizational learning” activities in order make design knowledge accessible over a longer period of time and across organizational dynamics ( Fischer , 2004 ) . Yet , all types of design collaboration share a basic need for externalizing and distributing design knowledge across individuals ( Cross , 2011 ; Fischer , 2004 ; Lawson , 2005 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Paulus , 2000 ) . In the following , research on the characteristics of design collaboration in groups is further discussed . Lawson ( 2005 ) argues that design groups are not just a collection of individuals , as they are bound together by a particular purpose . The author proposes five properties that distinguish a collection of individuals from a group : 1 ) the members of the group interact with each other ; 2 ) they share a common goal ; 3 ) they share common norms and direction ; 4 ) they develop a set of roles ; and 5 ) they develop a network of interpersonal attraction ( Lawson , 2005 ) . These characteristics are inherently interwoven and usually described within the notion of group dynamics . Groups possess dynamics because their attributes such as norms and roles grow out of the collection of individuals . For example , a group may develop a perception of a common goal and direction only after norms and roles are accepted . Within this process , it is likely that conflicts arise that force individual designers to accept certain norms . In the same way , roles are established only after some pain in “norming” and “forming” as Lawson ( 2005 ) puts it . Common roles that may emerge from a design group are for example : “Leaders” , “Clowns” , “Lawyers” and “Fools” ( Lawson , 2005 ) . While leaders are persons that impose a certain direction and goals to the group , a lawyer might keep the group within certain boundaries . While both roles seem beneficial for the group’s performance , the emergence of multiple leaders may lead to conflicts . Similarly , multiple lawyers might also limit the group’s potential . Clowns and fools seem to be useless in group work , however , Lawson argues that they can make others feel good or that they can be beneficial for resolving conflicts . Overall , group dynamics can both become a benefit and a drawback that needs to be controlled for effective collaboration . In professional practice , design groups therefore often employ leadership by pre - defining roles or by controlling the balance between individual and shared design work with the use of a facilitator ( Cross , 2011 ; Lawson , 2005 ) . By understanding the group’s dynamics , facilitators can help a group establish a set of norms and roles , but they may also intervene in the tensions between individual and group work . As Paulus notes , “groups can be trained by facilitators to generate ideas efficiently by limiting elaborations and off - task behavior” ( Paulus , 2000 , p . 243 ) . As these examples demonstrate , collaboration in design does not come naturally . Rather , it is a complex social process that has broad implications for how design is practiced . According to Cross , design groups typically engage in three basic activities : 1 ) gathering information ; 2 ) externalizing design knowledge and ideas ; and 3 ) reflecting on ( partial ) design solutions ( Cross , 2011 , p . 130 ) , which is similar to the way individual designers work . However , each activity – either individual or in teamwork – needs to be planned to some extent and is further extended through communication in the group . For example , individual designers may engage in gathering information separately only after the group has reached a common understanding and framing of the design problem . Similarly , generating design concepts and externalizing ideas is inherently influenced by the information that is shared within the group . For example , individual group members need to both generate own ideas but also have to adopt the ideas of others . Although the designers can potentially Theoretical Foundations 30 rely on a broader variety of concepts , accepting each other’s ideas or developing new ideas might be influenced by personal emotions , conflicts , fixations and attachment to concepts . When reflecting on design solutions , groups also need to reach a common perception and understanding among many different possibilities and directions . Cross ( 2011 ) argues that externalization is crucial not only for gathering information and sharing ideas , but also for presenting and discussing design solutions in design groups . The essential role of externalizations in designer’s group work is also shared by many other design researchers , as “externalizing an idea , making it ‘visible , ’ also makes it accessible for criticism , development , expansion , revision , and possible discard” ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 , p . 51 ) . Hence , an important characteristic of design groups is their visible way of communication through “artifacts” and “representations” that accompanies most design activities as a complement to verbal communication ( Arias & Fischer , 2000 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . In this context , Arias and Fischer ( 2000 ) refer to the notion of “boundary objects” . Boundary objects are “shared objects to talk about and to think with” that facilitate communication , coordination and common understanding within or across multiple CoP or CoI ( Arias , Eden , Fischer , Gorman , & Scharff , 2000 ) . These mostly physical externalizations serve the purpose to create “situations that talk back to us” ( Schön , 1983 ) and encourage face - to - face collaboration by providing a common language to the group that also allows group members to express themselves ( Arias & Fischer , 2000 ) . Figure 2 . 2 : Individual and collective creativity ( Warr & O’Neill , 2005 ) . Theoretically , a group of designers possesses more knowledge than an individual designer . By externalizing the individual’s and the group’s information , knowledge is accumulated which may enable a group to approach more design problems and to generate more design solutions ( Warr & O’Neill , 2005 ) . Further , through the combination of accumulated knowledge , entirely new concepts may emerge that are only made possible through the collective group knowledge . With this assumption , the creative process as described by Boden ( 1996 ) can also be extended toward the group , toward a process of “collective creativity” ( Mamykina et al . , 2002 ) . Each individual thereby may explore conceptual spaces by combining bundles of knowledge through transformations . Thus , if two persons would work independently from each other , each may combine two bundles of knowledge to one idea , which sums up to two ideas ( see Figure 2 . 2 , left ) . However , when externalizing 2222 ideas externalization 6666 ideas Individual Creativity ( nominal group ) Collective Creativity ( real group ) Bundle of knowledge Transformation Conceptual space Analysis 31 their individual bundles of knowledge within collaboration , the two individuals may combine four bundles of knowledge to a larger conceptual space that enables six possible transformations , which would result in six unique ideas . Hence , in theory and also as claimed by researchers such as Osborn ( 1953 ) , collaboration should make design more productive ( number of concepts ) and more innovative ( new combinations of knowledge ) than designers working individually . While the above described scenario was simplified to only two designers with each combining two bundles of knowledge , the scenario also holds for a larger number of individuals and more individual bundles of knowledge – resulting in exponential growth of idea production . When considering the environment and knowledge artifacts as additional bundles of knowledge that reside outside of conceptual spaces , situated collaborative creativity should therefore further increase the potential of collaboration in design ( Amabile , 1996 ) . However , for this theoretical potential to be realized in practice , efficient and effective ways of externalizing and communicating knowledge bundles have to be available to the group ( Warr & O’Neill , 2005 ) . As already emphasized above , externalization , communication and common understanding are therefore crucial factors for design collaboration . Yet , it was found that group dynamics and social factors have dramatic effects on a group’s effectiveness in externalization and communication , which limits the actual productivity of a group ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ) . Researchers have studied the performance of nominal groups ( individuals generating ideas separately ) and real groups ( individuals generating ideas collectively ) finding that nominal groups generally outperformed real groups in terms of the number of unique ideas produced . Indeed , as there is an abundance of studies – mostly involving the popular brainstorming method proposed by Osborn ( 1953 ) – showed that the total number of ideas as well as the total number of unique ideas of real groups is less than those of nominal groups , many researchers have recommended design work to be performed in nominal groups only ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ) . An abundance of factors have been identified that influence a group’s productivity such as group size , tasks , training , the types of representations used , group compatibility , group homogeneity , knowledge , training , motivation , facilitation , and social influences between individuals such as production blocking , evaluation apprehension and free riding ( Mullen , Johnson , & Salas , 1991 ; Warr , 2007 ) . It is assumed that these factors accumulate in such a way as to make creative group work a highly complex process that is hard to measure in a controlled quantitative way ( Stroebe & Diehl , 1991 ) . Nevertheless , researchers account the most dramatic negative influences on creative group work to the social influences between collaborating individuals ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ) . Diehl and Stroebe ( 1987 ) argue that the most important factor that makes nominal groups outperform real groups is a social phenomenon called production blocking , which relates to verbal communication in the group . Due to the synchronous nature of verbal communication , members of idea generating groups cannot exchange their ideas simultaneous . Hence , some team members are inhibited from expressing their ideas when someone is speaking to the group . Rather , the individuals have to take turns , which makes them have to remember ideas until they can express them to the group . The need to remember ideas in turn leads to increased chances of forgetting ideas and harms the overall flow of communication . Individuals were further observed to suppress their ideas because they thought they are less relevant to the group as the discussion moved on . A further issue in production blocking is that individuals may heavily reflect on their own ideas and thereby are not always interested in listening to others . Eventually , individuals may lose their motivation in contributing ideas to the group if they are repeatedly unable to do so ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ) . Similar issues described as production blocking were also observed by other researchers ( Bouchard & Hare , 1970 ; Isaksen , 1998 ) . Theoretical Foundations 32 A further factor described by Diehl and Stroebe ( 1987 ) as particular important is related to the fear of criticism within the group that prevents individuals in externalizing their ideas . This phenomenon , often termed evaluation apprehension is based on the assumption that group members may perceive their own expertise as less important in comparison to the group’s expertise or that they perceive other members of the group as more proficient . Hence , in the fear of being criticized for their own ideas , individuals contribute less to the group than they could possible do . Empirical studies have also indicated a decrease of productivity when domain experts are present even if they are not involved in the group’s work ( Collaros & Anderson , 1969 ) . Further , empirical studies showed that groups exposed to strict evaluation criteria were contributing significantly less ideas to a group than in a situation with no or only vague evaluation criteria ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ; Isaksen , 1998 ) . Eventually , free riding or social loafing is another social phenomenon documented by Diehl and Stroebe ( 1987 ) that may lead to significantly less productivity in creative group work . This factor assumes that individuals are relying on others and therefore do not contribute ideas in the extent that they would possible be able to do . ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ) explain this effect due to the fact that individual contributions are not always visible when the result of the group work is assessed as a whole rather than each individual contribution separately . In comparison , individuals working alone can always be made accountable for their individual efforts and performance . Hence they are motivated by the chance of excelling in the production of many unique and innovative ideas as this reflects back upon their individual personality . Lawson ( 2005 ) emphasizes that this effect is particularly strong in the design profession as designers tend to see themselves as gifted personalities and hence often claim authority of an original idea . The author further argues that this leads to designers having a general reluctance of sharing ideas , as this makes them lose their ownership and accountability as an individual creative person . Researchers have proposed a variety of measures that can be applied to overcome the described inhibitors of creative group work . Osborn ( 1953 ) for example proposed that groups should follow a set of rules and that they make use of certain representations to stimulate the externalization of as many ideas as possible and to minimize the effects of social influences . For example , in order to address production blocking , groups may use visual media or written notes for externalizing and sharing ideas . This way , blocking is minimized and group members may work independently and simultaneous while still being able to exchange ideas ( Osborn , 1953 ) . Paulus ( 2000 ) found that idea exchange on paper notes in a real group produced more unique ideas than in a group of non - interacting persons ( nominal group ) ( Paulus , 2000 , p . 247 ) . Osborn ( 1953 ) further suggested that criticism should be separated from idea generation and that unusual ideas should be accepted . These measures clearly address evaluation apprehension issues , as group members are more likely to contribute ideas if they do not have to expect harsh criticism . Researchers also proposed to balance individual work with shared activities as to address both evaluation apprehension and free riding . For example , a separation into individual and shared workspaces is recommended as this gives group members a protective area to work out “wild” ideas before sharing them with the group ( Paulus , 2000 ) . Similarly , by using measures to make contributions anonymous ( e . g . through computer systems ) , individual accountability is limited which may reduce evaluation apprehension . However , it is to mention that reducing individual accountability also has an effect on free riding , as group members might be less motivated to contribute if their individual ideas are not visible ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ) . Hence , ensuring individual accountability can also be motivating and may enhance the group’s performance . Figure 2 . 3 depicts the interplay of social factors and their potential influences on productivity within creative collaboration . Eventually , the use of professional facilitators was proposed by several scholars as they are able to train groups to generate ideas more effectively by eliminating or reducing distractions or by motivating individual group members ( Lawson , 2005 ; Analysis 33 Paulus , 2000 ) . A study even found that groups with highly trained facilitators were able to function at the level of nominal groups ( Oxley , Dzindolet , & Paulus , 1996 ) . Hence , the discussed research indicates that despite the variety of potential inhibitors , creative group work can potentially be more productive under the premise that it is performed in a structured and controlled manner . Figure 2 . 3 : Social factors and their influence on the productivity of collaborative design ( Hilliges et al . , 2007 ) . The benefits and drawbacks of collaboration in design have been discussed within the aspect of productivity in terms of the number of unique ideas that may be generated by combining the knowledge of several designers . Although creative group work is a complex issue that needs a careful design of work practices to make it effective , researchers also note that productivity is not the only concern in creative collaboration and that many other more subjective considerations make it beneficial in design practice ( Lawson , 2005 ; Oxley et al . , 1996 ; Paulus , 2000 ; Sutton & Hargadon , 1996 ) . For example , design collaboration is in itself valuable as it makes individuals more satisfied with their work ( Lawson , 2005 ) and as it facilitates the development of organizational memory , methodological practices and group norms ( Paulus , 2000 ; Sutton & Hargadon , 1996 ) . Further , collaboration enables multiple CoP to benefit from their different perspectives and to tackle problems that are impossible to solve by individual designers only ( Fischer , 2004 ) . Eventually , collaboration in design is also an important ingredient of reflective practice and a tool for learning ( Schön , 1983 ) . 2 . 1 . 7 Summary This chapter provided a discussion of the theoretical foundations this thesis builds upon . The most important theses put forward by the presented literature review may be summarized as follows : Design involves a designer or a team of designers that engage in a process to produce a novel or refined product which serves a particular purpose . Design in HCI has been increasingly influenced by design methodology as a complement to traditional engineering - centric approaches due to an increased complexity imposed by a transition from object - centered design to experienced - centered design . Design problems and their ill - defined nature are the foundation to design complexity which leads to certain characteristics such as the open - ended nature of design , the problem space and the solution space , framing activities , subjective judgment , tradeoffs , critique , fixation and attachment to concepts as well as the generation of alternatives . Theoretical Foundations 34 Design process is a methodology to approach design problems within analysis , synthesis and evaluation activities . This process is characterized as open - ended , highly iterative , and conversational involving a simultaneous exploration and reduction of a problem space and a solution space . Further this process is involves switching between action and reflection modes , between partial solutions and holistic solutions and between divergence as well as convergence whereby externalizations , subjective judgment and individual knowledge of designers are crucial . Creativity in design is a cognitive process of knowledge transformation that accompanies the design process . It also addresses personal skill and the ability of divergent and convergent thinking a designer might possess . Further , it can be considered a property of a product that is considered novel and appropriate . Collaboration in design enables designers to approach more complex problems by combining knowledge from multiple domains . Externalization is fundamental to design collaboration as it makes design knowledge accessible . However , collaboration does not come naturally and needs to be planned , since group dynamics and social influences can expose dramatic effects on the productivity of design groups . The conclusions deducted from this literature review regarding the framework this thesis is grounded in are defined in Table 2 . 2 . Table 2 . 2 : Theoretical conclusions regarding the four themes of the thesis framework . Theoretical Foundations Externalization Design involves externalization within all phases of the design process as it makes design knowledge “real” and accessible in both individual and collaborative design work . It is only through externalization that ideas can be acted upon within analysis , synthesis and evaluation activities . Reflection Design involves reflection as an important activity to rationally think about partial solutions , goals and directions within the design process . As ingredient of the iterative and open - ended design process , reflection is required to constantly question and evaluate the progress and appropriateness of design solutions . Collaboration Design is a social activity that involves collaboration as a mean for approaching complex design problems . Collaboration requires externalization and sharing of design knowledge through planned and structured group activities . Process Design is a process characterized by divergent and convergent activities . Creativity and subjective judgments of designers are required to approach both modes rationally . Structured methods and tools can make divergent and convergent activities more productive . Analysis 35 2 . 2 Design as Embodied Practice In the previous chapter , design has been described and analyzed from a theoretical standpoint . As such , it was studied as a cognitive process and as a general methodology for solving ill - defined problems . However , design can also be seen from a practical standpoint – as situated and embodied practice – as something that takes place in the “real world” . Many researchers in cognitive science argue that cognitive processes are indeed “embodied , environmentally embedded” ( Clark , 1998 ) or that “human cognition is always situated in a complex sociocultural world and cannot be unaffected by it . ” ( Hutchins , 1996 ) . The word “embodied” hence emphasizes a view of design that takes place outside of individual minds and that it is manifested by actions and artifacts as “an interactive process between mind and world” ( Gedenryd , 1998 ) , where “social and embodied action becomes a way of actually doing design” ( Tholander et al . , 2008 ) . In the following , this embodied nature of design will be discussed by referring to the roles of physical externalizations and sketching activities in design , by discussing collaborative practices and design environments as well as materiality and information handling in design . By further describing commonly used design methods , field data from many different researchers in the field of design practice is synthesized . The word “practice” can have multiple meanings and it is therefore important to define this term for the proceedings of this chapter ( Goodman , Wakkary , & Stolterman , 2011 ) . According to Goodman et al . ( 2011 ) , “practice” may refer to the “composite of what practitioners do , what they experience , and the context where this takes place” . Therefore , the notion of “design practice” is not limited to individual minds and bodies only , but to the environments , activities , methods and tools that are used in a situated and social process of design . In the following , a particular view on design practice is provided that is intentionally situated in the real world – ignoring the use of digital tools and materials that are without doubt part of every modern design process . However , the use of digital tools and materials within the design process and their relation to embodied design practice is discussed within the next sections . 2 . 2 . 1 Externalization & Reflection Theoretically , externalization relates to theories of embodiment and reflection , which emphasize the role of the external environment in human cognition . In recent research , this view of cognition as a dualism of internal and external processes has become increasingly popular ( Dix & Gongora , 2011 ; Dourish , 2004 ) . The origins of this movement can be traced back to the influence of the notion of embodiment in philosophy ( Clark , 1998 ; Heidegger , 1962 ) . Embodiment emphasizes the role of interactions with the world in contrast to entirely mental models of cognition that characterized thought as an internal process ( Cartesian dualism ) . Further influences can also be found in psychology , where Gibson proposed the concept of affordance , which argues that that perception is inherently tied to action ( Gibson , 1986 ) . Theoretical frameworks such as distributed cognition ( Hutchins , 1996 ) and situated action ( Suchman , 1987 ) , that also influenced HCI research , argue that humans actively use the physical and social properties of the world for solving problems . The role of externalization and embodiment in design practice was heavily influenced by Schön’s studies of professional practitioners which often utilized external representations for different kinds of reflections ( Schön , 1983 ) . Externalization in design is commonly regarded as essential and crucial in both individual and collaborative design work ( Buxton , 2007 ; Cross , 2007 ; Dix & Gongora , 2011 ; Lawson , 2005 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . It thereby refers to the activity of creating external representations during design processes by putting internal thoughts into the physical world . Lawson argues that “the designer , however , has never resembled Rodin’s ‘Thinker’ who sits in solitary meditation , but has in Design as Embodied Practice 36 contrast always externalized his thoughts , not only as an end - product in the form of a design , but as an integral part of the process itself in the form of drawings and sketches . ” ( Lawson , 1980 ) . Dix and Gongora even argue that externalization is central to human intelligence , as “the active shaping of the world as an intellectual resource , maybe a uniquely human ability and certainly the foundation of culture and civilization . ” ( Dix & Gongora , 2011 ) . In this context , externalizations may take many forms such as models , sketches or diagrams and serve many different purposes such as the communication and elaboration of ideas . External representations in design , often called “Design Artifacts” , can consistently be found across different design disciplines and in many different formats ( Boling & Smith , 2008 ) . In industrial design and graphic design for example , sketches , drawings , models and mood boards are used for externalizing design knowledge . Similarly , architects and product designers use plans , models and physical mock - ups as a way to visualize their thoughts . In software design , externalizations may be quite diverse , ranging from paper sketches or whiteboard drawings , over simple flow diagrams to more formal notations such as UML ( Unified Modeling Language ) . In HCI and interaction design , a variety of externalizations are used such as sketches , wireframes , storyboards or prototypes . As Dix and Gongora ( 2011 ) note , these different forms of external representations serve particular facets of design , such as the product , the problem space , the design space and the process . Externalizations in design can hence be used to describe a potential product in the form of a hypothesis , experiment or proposal . For example , sketches , models and prototypes may be used to test how ideas work out in practice or for communicating ideas to others . However , externalizations may also be used to describe and express a design problem or the context of a design problem . As such , they may assist designers in “grasping” all features of a design problem or for facilitating shared understanding of design problems in a group of designers . While the externalization of one particular product contributes to the representation of one possible solution to a design problem , multiple alternative externalizations can also be used to represent possibilities of the design space . Eventually , designers also create externalizations of the process they follow as tool for coordination and reflection on the actual activity of design and the design process . These representations often manifest in the form of schedules , maps or plans . Dix and Gongora ( 2011 ) further note that externalizations differ in their properties and dimensions . As external artifacts , externalizations are usually physical , presenting one particular aspect of an idea or product in detail . Yet , they may also be schematic , representing only aspects of an idea by still staying distant from a product . Eventually , they can also be symbolic , representing only abstract and vague concepts , such as a mind map or an equation . Externalizations also differ in their modality , as they may be expressed in different languages and styles such as written language , speech , drawings , as tactile and haptic object or even as movements of the body or as gestures . Finally , some externalizations such as sketches or models are persistent as they remain in the physical world over a longer period of time , while other externalized artifacts such as whiteboard drawings or the words in a conversation are transient . As externalizations of internal thoughts , external representations have their value in design by allowing the designer to interact with the world , with others and with oneself ( Dix & Gongora , 2011 ) . As a concept is put into the world , it is subject to physical laws that are not existent in the mental space . For example , when perception is created through interactions in the physical environment , humans may perceive concepts differently once they become real ( Gibson , 1986 ) . Or as Kirsh puts it : “The physical world does not lie . [ … ] If we can build it , then it must be logically and physically viable” ( Kirsh , 2010 ) . As architects build a building as physical foam board model , they may realize that it is too small or that windows are facing a wrong direction . Hence , these “reflective conversations with materials” ( Schön , 1983 ) or “thinking through doing” ( Klemmer et al . , 2006 ) interactions allow for realizing constraints and limitations of an idea but may also stimulate variations or entirely different Analysis 37 concepts . However , external representations also serve communication and coordination between individual designers as a common point of reference , as shared memory and resource that facilitates common understanding ( Boling & Smith , 2008 ) . Further , persistent externalizations enable a designer to interact with himself in the form of a memory aid and tool for thinking . As Kirsh notes , humans create external structure when thinking because “through interaction it is easier to process more efficiently and more effectively than by working inside the head alone” ( Kirsh , 2010 ) . This is partly due to the fact that external representations save internal memory and computation by lowering the costs of controlling and coordinating thoughts , by forcing more explicit encoding of information , and by facilitating re - interpretation ( Kirsh , 2010 ) . Kirsh even argues that “physical interaction with tangible elements is a necessary part of our thinking process because there are occasions when we must harness physical processes to formulate and transition between thoughts” ( Kirsh , 2010 , p . 452 ) . Externalization is hence inherently connected to reflection . As ideas are externalized , they have their main purpose in “talking back” to the designer or a team of designers ( Buxton , 2007 ) . Kirsh thereby emphasizes the role of multiple representations and re - arrangement that are facilitated by externalizations . “Without interacting with multiple representations certain discoveries would simply be out of reach” ( Kirsh , 2010 , p . 451 ) . “Reorganizing pieces in physical space makes it possible to examine relations that before were distant or visually complex [ … ] Action and vision have been substituted for imagery , projection , and memory . Physical movement has replaced mental computation . Instead of imagining transformations , we execute them externally” ( Kirsh , 2010 ) . 2 . 2 . 2 Sketching Design researchers often describe the externalization of thoughts as a core skill of designers and even as the very essence of what design work is about ( Buxton , 2007 ; Cross , 2007 ; Fallman , 2003 ; Lawson , 2005 ) . Thereby , they mostly distinguish between two kinds of externalizations in design : external representation for public communication and presentation and external representation as thinking aid ( Baskinger , 2008 ; Buxton , 2007 ; Fallman , 2003 ) . While the former relates to the designer’s communication skills , the latter can be considered as a core skill of being able to rapidly interact between the individual mind and externalizations as a way of thinking and working . This particular way of externalizing thoughts as a vehicle of cognition is often referred to as “Sketching” . In this sense , designers engage in the activity of sketching as an embodied way to support their cognition and creativity ( Hartson & Pyla , 2012 ) . Craft and Cairns thereby refer to two concepts that are repeatedly cited in the literature : lateral transformations and cycles of generation and interpretation ( Craft & Cairns , 2009 ) . The concept of lateral transformation refers to the production of related , but distinctly different drawings during sketching activity ( generation of alternatives ) , while the cycles of generation and interpretation can be seen as “dialectic” in nature ( Goldschmidt , 1991 ) , whereby idea generation and the consideration of alternatives are practiced in highly iterative cycles ( iteration ) . Fallman ( 2003 ) argues that sketching is hence directly related to design as a process , as this way of working and thinking parallels with design methodology . Researchers also found evidence that sketching in particular supports the designer’s capability of dealing with ill - defined and wicked problems as sketches can be considered ill - defined representations . Goel notes that “some ill - structured problems require ‘ill - structured’ representations to prevent premature crystallization of ideas and facilitate the generation and exploration of alternate solutions” ( Goel , 1995 ) . Hence , one major benefit designers harness when using sketches in their work practices is that they have a tool that facilitates cognition about loosely defined design problems and design solutions . Cross similarly describes sketching as aiding problem structuring through solution attempts : “Sketching enables exploration of the problem space and the solution space to proceed together , assisting the designer to converge on a matching problem - solution pair” ( Cross , Design as Embodied Practice 38 2007 ) . This is again in line with the “conversational” and “open - ended” character of the design process . Goldschmidt ( 1991 ) argues that the “sketchy” , vague and rough nature of sketches is crucial to their value in the design process as they allow designers to engage in analogical and metaphoric thinking . Goldschmidt thereby makes a distinction between “seeing - that” and “seeing - as” . Seeing - as allows designers to derive new meaning from the sketched representations , while seeing - that allows designers to develop an understanding of the consequences a particular concept or idea yields ( see Figure 2 . 4 ) . Schön ( 1983 ) describes this process of “seeing - drawing - seeing” as a concept that characterizes reflection - in - action . Sketching can thus be seen as an inherently embodied form of a reflective conversation ( Tholander et al . , 2008 ) . Hartson and Pyla note that sketching also synthesizes the designer as a human being including her hands , her mind and her senses . The authors argue that “the kinesthetics of sketching , pointing , holding , and touching bring the entire hand - eye - brain coordination feedback loop to bear on the problem solving . [ … ] physical motor movements are coupled with visual and cognitive activity ; the designer’s mind and body potentiate each other in invention . ” ( Hartson & Pyla , 2012 , p . 286 ) . Design researchers hence emphasize the embodied role of sketching in problem solving processes as it effectively supports the design activities of divergent and convergent thinking , reflection and rapid iteration . Figure 2 . 4 : Sketching as a conversation between the mind and external representations ( Buxton , 2007 ) . Buxton ( 2007 ) notes that sketching as a design activity is not to be mistaken with the general activity of externalizing thoughts . Rather , the type of representation needs to have certain properties in order to be considered as a sketch that can be used effectively as a vehicle of thought in the design process as described above . Therefore , the author defines relevant attributes of what sketches are ( Buxton , 2007 , p . 111 ) : Quick : sketches are quick to make . Timely : sketches can be provided when needed . Inexpensive : sketches are cheap and do not inhibit the ability to explore a concept . Disposable : sketches are only as valuable as the concept they represent . Thus , the designer should not invest too much effort as this would inhibit their value as vehicle of thought . Plentiful : sketches are meaningful and relevant only in a context of a collection or series of alternatives . mindmindmindmind internal knowledge sketchsketchsketchsketchexternal representation create ( seeing - that ) ( seeing - as ) read Analysis 39 Clear vocabulary : sketches distinguish themselves from other representations through their informality and style . Distinct gesture : sketches are not precise and tight , rather they communicate a sense of freedom and openness . Minimal detail : sketches only include enough detail to render the intended concept . Appropriate degree of refinement : sketches represent a level of refinement that reflects the current elaboration of a concept in the design process . Suggest and explore rather than confirm : sketches don’t define but suggest desired and appropriate characteristics . Ambiguity : sketches can be interpreted in different ways , even by the person who created them . Accordingly , the word “sketch” should not be used as a synonym for the word “drawing” . Rather , a representation that classifies as a sketch can have very different forms and formats from simple words , sentences , to interactive tangible representations or physical models . According to Buxton , everything can be considered a sketch as long as it conforms to the above cited attributes . Buxton further notes that design sketches can take different form based on the design discipline and process stage they are used in . For example , while product designers may employ drawings or tangible mock - ups of components for envisioning the form and function of a product , sketches in HCI and interaction design need to able to capture properties of interactive systems such as dynamics , feel and user experience . Hence , their form and fidelity varies from simple paper sketches to interactive sketches that may not even be distinguishable from real and functional systems ( e . g . Wizard of OZ ) . Buxton’s descriptions of interactive sketches and methods and techniques for creating them has been very influential in recent HCI research and practice and are now widely taught in academia ( Greenberg et al . , 2012 ) . Thus far , sketching has been regarded as an individual activity that aids designers in thinking and reflecting . However , as many scholars agree , sketching can also be useful as a group activity ( Buxton , 2007 ; Cross , 2007 ; Greenberg et al . , 2012 ; Hartson & Pyla , 2012 ; Lawson , 2005 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Lugt , 2001 ) . Buxton ( 2007 ) for examples states that “sketches are social things” that expose their real value in encouraging social discourse . Lugt ( 2002a ) notes that many of the functions of sketching such as re - interpretation and lateral transformations are also true for sketching as a group activity . However , when performing sketching in groups , designers are not only able to re - interpret their own ideas , but also the ideas of others . Further , he argues that sketching in group meetings can also stimulate the use of earlier ideas by enhancing their accessibility . He thereby distinguishes between three types of sketches : the thinking sketch , the talking sketch and the storing sketch . The thinking sketch refers to the individual idea generation process . It helps the designer in externalizing ill - defined design problems and solutions and contributes to the individual re - interpretive cycle by means of its indeterminacy . The talking sketch in contrast can be seen as a form of communication to other designers . It also allows externalizing ill - defined problems and solutions and invites re - interpretation because of its properties such as ambiguity . However , due to its accessibility to other designers , it can be interpreted in much more different ways than in individual interpretation . As a result , misinterpretations are quite common and “often welcomed , because they may provide radical new insights” ( Lugt , 2001 ) . Hence , collaborative re - interpretation may lead to novel directions for generating ideas in subsequent cycles . Eventually , the storing sketch can be seen as a form of documentation that refers to the persistence of sketches within a group environment . Through externalizing ideas within group sketching activities , designers have the ability to archive and Design as Embodied Practice 40 retrieve design information , which stimulates the re - use of earlier ideas and eventually leads to a building up of a “shared external memory” ( Lugt , 2001 ) . According to McKim ( 1972 ) , such “collective graphic memory” fosters the creative process in the group by facilitating shared understanding and common references . Figure 2 . 5 shows an extended model of the sketching process as a conversation between individual external representations and shared external representations . The conversation between individual minds and shared representations is facilitated by the accessibility of shared artifacts and by verbal as well as gestural communication with other individuals ( Lugt , 2001 ) . Figure 2 . 5 : Sketching as a group activity ( Lugt , 2001 ) , adapted by the author . Researchers also emphasize the interplay of verbal communication , embodied actions and material representations in the context of collaborative sketching activities ( Lugt , 2001 ; Tholander et al . , 2008 ; Visser & Maher , 2011 ) . Thereby , collaborative sketching is also accompanied by verbal communication as a mean for constructing shared understanding through work with language as a creative tool . Language hence acts as a supplement to the properties that are not materialized or visible within the shared sketch : “by acting upon the graphical representation through their use of language they refined their sketch and thereby conversational action became a way of doing sketching” ( Tholander et al . , 2008 ) . Further , the authors found that gestures and body movements are ubiquitous in collaborative sketching activities as designers use their hands and body parts for gestures such as pointing or waving . An especially frequent phenomenon thereby is a particular type of gesture called “deictic reference” – a gesture that refers to a particular part of an external representation and hence facilitates “artifact - mediated communication” ( Visser & Maher , 2011 ) . Visser and Maher argue that gestures are not only complementary to verbal communication , but fundamental due to their role in “organizing the functional design activities of generation , transformation , and evaluation of design proposals” ( Visser & Maher , 2011 , p . 216 ) . In that sense , external representations also have a mediating role as they are actively used as a verbal and bodily point of reference in communication among designers . This is however not only true for sketching activities , but rather for the entire process of collaborative design that also involves more formal and unambiguous external representations . Buxton ( 2007 ) hence argues that the physical and social ecology in which design activities are performed are crucial for supporting creative cognition as these must support awareness and accessibility of external representations . mindmindmindmind internal knowledge individualindividualindividualindividualexternal representation sharedsharedsharedsharedexternal representation gestural and gestural and gestural and gestural and verbal communication verbal communication verbal communication verbal communication Analysis 41 2 . 2 . 3 Design Environments Hutchins claims that “humans create their cognitive powers by creating the environments in which they exercise those powers” ( Hutchins , 1996 , p . 169 ) . Hence , once may expect that designers and groups of designers create social and physical environments that support design cognition and work practices . From the above described characteristics of embodied design practice , three needs for creative design environments may be extracted : the need for accessibility and awareness of individual and shared externalizations , the need for materiality of externalizations as a prerequisite for embodied interactions and the need of persistence of externalizations as a form of collective memory and long - term shared reference . Thus , in the following , descriptions from different design researchers are examined for describing how these features manifest in actual design environments . Figure 2 . 6 : Use of material externalizations and display space in design studios 3 . Buxton ( 2007 ) describes the concept of “design spaces” as social and physical ecologies where sketches and other externalizations become part of collaborative design work . These physical spaces , often called “design studios” are rooms with abundant display space and typically feature large surfaces such as tables , pin boards or wall - mounted cork boards ( see Figure 2 . 6 ) . According to many design researchers , it is common for designers to utilize this space for pinning up external representations in the direct area in which they are working for both being open to their own reflections and to responses from colleagues ( Black , 1990 ; Buxton , 2007 ; Gaver , 1992 ; G . Johnson , 2007 ; Vyas , 2011 ) . Indeed , studies of creative practice have shown that designers utilize informal collections of design material to support lateral thinking and communication ( Keller , 2005 ; Sharmin et al . , 2009 ; Sharmin & Bailey , 2011 ) . Sharing , organizing and browsing design work in direct juxtaposition is an established practice ( Keller et al . , 2004 ) that helps designers to discover and explore new relationships and also gives them the opportunity to collaborate with other designers in an ad - hoc manner ( Buxton , 2007 ) . Buxton emphasizes that the shared surface as an object itself and through its 3 Images from http : / / images . businessweek . com / ss / 09 / 09 / 0930 _ worlds _ best _ design _ schools / index . htm Design as Embodied Practice 42 affordances stimulates cognitive and social behavior by facilitating shared awareness and accessibility of common references . However , he also notes that “simply plunking a bunch of corkboards or foamboards around your work space does not magically turn it into a design studio . These are artifacts with certain affordances , but their effective use requires as much attention to the cultivation of the culture of the studio as to the detailing of the architectural space” ( Buxton , 2007 , p . 155 ) . Therefore , the design studio is not just a work place , but also implies a culture of collaborative practices like sharing , collaborating , juxtaposition and critique . Similarly , Fallman ( 2007 ) argues that not only the visual and haptic qualities of design studios shape “design studio culture” . Rather he adds that “perhaps most importantly , design studio culture is acted out . It exists in how people behave , dress , talk , relate to each other , and socialize . Thus , design studio culture comprises a set of specific activities on the one hand , but also a number of desirable social practices , a way of being on the other” . Schön also describes the design studio as a model of learning and reflective practice ( Schön , 1985 ) . Researchers in CSCW increasingly report the material and spatial nature of cooperative work practices as crucial for coordinating group activities ( Hutchins , 1996 ; Kirsh , 1995 ; Sellen & Harper , 2003 ) . Some researchers however specifically studied the design studio as a collaborative workplace within ethnographic studies . Thereby , the studies typically report the role of physical space , the use of material artifacts and typical informal collaborative interactions as properties of design environments ( Jacucci & Wagner , 2007 ; Kristensen , 2004 ; Vyas , Heylen , et al . , 2009a ; Vyas , Heylen , & Nijholt , 2008 ; Vyas , Veer , et al . , 2009 ; Vyas , 2009 ; Wagner , Tellioglu , Balka , Simone , & Ciolfi , 2009 ) . These authors also discuss how appropriation and customization of available space and architecture is utilized for supporting work practices ( see Vyas , 2011 , p . 115ff for a discussion ) . Vyas et al . for example report from a longitudinal , eight - month ethnographic study in two design studios ( Vyas , Heylen , Nijholt , & Veer , 2009b ; Vyas , Heylen , & Nijholt , 2008 ) . Among their findings , they report that a single design team collectively develops an average of 50 to 100 external representations of design ideas . These externalizations typically serve a particular purpose within the design process and evolve or change over time . The authors thereby classify these externalizations as artifacts for exploration , communication and use . Exploratory artifacts inform designers within iterative cycles of exploration and generation regarding both design problems and design solutions . They can be inspirational and socio - cultural in nature , such as information on people’s experiences , emotions , or performance . As typically relating to everyday life , these artifacts allow designers to understand the domain they are designing for . Examples for such artifacts are mood - boards , cultural probes or field data . In contrast , artifacts that serve communication are created by designers with the explicit intent of communicating design concepts or solutions to other designers . These can be sketches , storyboards , models and physical or tangible representations . According to Vyas ( 2008 ) , their purpose lies primarily in establishing common ground and awareness within a group of designers . Eventually , artifacts for use serve the purpose of collaboratively experiencing and testing design concepts . For example , prototypes or interactive sketches are used to invite informal critique and feedback on design ideas in later stages of the design process . Based on the same ethnographic study , Vyas et al . also report typical appropriation and use of space within design studios ( Vyas , Veer , et al . , 2009 ; Vyas , 2009 ) . Although the use of space has become implicit in everyday work practice , it is an important tool within human thinking and planning behavior ( Kirsh , 1995 ) . Similar to other researchers who studied the use of space as a way of thinking and working ( Kirsh , 1995 ) , the authors report that the availability of space and spatial arrangements play an important role in individual cognition but also in social interactions in the context of design studios . Vyas ( 2009 ) describes four types of surfaces that are used by designers as sites of methodic Analysis 43 design practices : 1 ) personal surfaces , 2 ) shared surfaces , 3 ) project - specific surfaces and 4 ) live surfaces . Each surface has its own implications for individual and collaborative design practices . Figure 2 . 7 : Personal surfaces serve designer ' s individual externalization and reflection ( Vyas , 2009 ) . Personal surfaces such as those pictured in Figure 2 . 7 , are created and utilized by individual designers . They are typically established within personal work areas such as at an office desk or office corner and feature desks , walls or whiteboards and corkboards . They are owned by a particular designer and usually contain private or semi - private work material such as exploratory externalizations and project - related information . Vyas ( 2009 ) found that designers – although mostly preferring horizontal surfaces – used either horizontal and vertical displays or a mix of both and that arrangements of artifacts on these surfaces are quite diverse . While the persistence of artifacts within these surfaces is quite long - term , the arrangements are adapted and re - organized as design projects progress . Hence , the surfaces provide rather individual information such as current work - in - progress , reminders , and individual resources for project management . Yet , they are not only used for organizational and reflective work , but also for subjective purposes such as to express a social identity within the social ecology of the studio . Hence , information about successful projects and achievements may be attached to surfaces for summarizing the experience and success of the individual designer . Figure 2 . 8 : Shared surfaces serve designer ' s collective memory ( Vyas , 2009 ) . In contrast , shared surfaces are owned and used by a group of collaborating individuals to share general resources . Vyas found that the artifacts displayed on such shared surfaces are either created individually or collaboratively and are inspirational or communicative in nature . Thus , shared surfaces Design as Embodied Practice 44 contain communication artifacts such as storyboards , sketches , models but also inspirational artifacts like visual material , magazine clips and other images . Since these surfaces are used for different purposes and by different people , they evolve over time and require some formal organization . Vyas hence observed patterns , clusters and colored notes that are used to structure or categorize information ( see Figure 2 . 8 ) . Similar behavior was also observed by Keller et al . ( 2004 ) . The authors argue that the persistence , visibility and accessibility of artifacts and the ease of re - arrangements and informal organization facilitate long - term awareness similar to a collective memory that is required for design collaboration . Figure 2 . 9 : Project - specific surfaces are shared surfaces that facilitate group coordination ( Vyas , 2009 ) . Vyas ( 2009 ) also identified a particular type of shared surface , the project - specific surface ( see Figure 2 . 9 ) . Similar to the shared surface , this spatial environment is created by a group of collaborating individuals . However , instead of providing general long - term information and inspiration , these kinds of surfaces are used to coordinate projects that designers are working on . Hence , artifacts that are shared on these temporary surfaces contain project - relevant information such as schedules , lists , tasks , division of work , concepts and sketches as well as important constraints such as deadlines . Through a collaborative process , the contents of such surfaces change and evolve as designers organize , manage and reflect on the progress of their project . Thereby , the externalizations are used in asynchronous and in synchronous modes of collaboration , such as designers leaving traces after finishing tasks while others are not present , or designers discussing open topics in ad - hoc meetings . Figure 2 . 10 : Live surfaces are ephemeral spaces that facilitate group interaction and discussion ( Vyas , 2009 ) . Eventually , live surfaces are temporary surfaces created and used by designers for synchronous group activities such as brainstorming , group sketching and discussion ( see Figure 2 . 10 ) . Vyas notes that Analysis 45 these surfaces are typically very short - lived as they are only created and used until a particular session is over . In contrast to the other types of surfaces described previously , these spaces are constantly being manipulated and changed and are arranged and organized collaboratively in a highly iterative manner . Therefore , different sizes and types of artifacts are employed , ranging from inspirational artifacts such as images and field data , over communicative artifacts such as sketches , notes and models to artifacts for use , such as physical models and prototypes . As Vyas ( 2009 ) emphasizes , the use and appropriation of the workspaces during these group sessions are dependent on the particular method used for collaboration . Nevertheless , he observed transitions between work on horizontal work surfaces ( table ) and vertical surfaces ( whiteboard or wall ) as these have different affordances and qualities during collaborative work . For example , the table is usually used for manipulating , while the wall is used for reflecting on created contents . This type of behavior was also observed by others ( Rogers & Lindley , 2004 ; Tang & Fels , 2008 ; Terrenghi , Quigley , & Dix , 2009 ) , who also argue that horizontal and vertical displays have differences in accessibility and visibility which makes them more or less suitable for particular collaborative practices . 2 . 2 . 4 Embodied Actions Within design environments such as design studios , designers do not only use their spatial environment as an aid for cognitive and social processes , but also use bodily interactions and materiality as important tools that aid cognition and collaboration . Researchers argue that designers make extensive use of their bodies while talking , explaining or discussing external representations ( Jacucci & Wagner , 2007 ; Vyas , Heylen , et al . , 2009a ) . Thereby , designers also utilize physical references to material artifacts that are accessible to them or those artifacts themselves , as a form of “artifact - mediated” communication ( Tory , Staub - French , Po , & Wu , 2008 ) . This is crucial , as studies have for example shown that gestures that accompany speech lessen cognitive load and also help others in understanding a particular concept ( Vyas , 2011 ) . Robertson ( 1991 ) provides a “Taxonomy of Embodied Actions” within the context of co - located and synchronous design work ( see Figure 2 . 11 ) . Based on literature reviews and own empirical studies involving group work of designers , he identified and classified categories of embodied forms of interaction . Thereby , he makes a general distinction between embodied actions of 1 ) individuals interacting with physical objects , 2 ) other bodies or 3 ) their workspace , and the 4 ) activity of a group as a whole . Hence , individual actions of group members enable the activity of the group , while the group as a whole is something different that requires its own set of categories . Thereby , he emphasizes that all actions need to be interpreted in their particular context such as the physical and spatial environment they take place . Hence , in the following , examples are given regarding the context of the design environment . Figure 2 . 11 : Taxonomy of embodied actions ( T . Robertson , 1991 ) , own depiction . A common theme that relates to individual embodied actions is that they combine hand and eye , or perception and action . These actions can be separated into interactions performed in relation to individual embodied actions group activities • conversing • looking • organizing • creating • sharing • focusing • breaking • seizing objects • moving • producing • highlighting • using bodies • signaling • pretending workspace • moving around • pointing • shifting gaze • moving in or out Design as Embodied Practice 46 specific objects , bodies or workspaces ( T . Robertson , 1991 ) . As thus , designers may perform following embodied interactions with an object : 1 ) Moving physical objects , 2 ) Producing a private physical representation , 3 ) Highlighting some aspect of an object , and 4 ) Using a physical object . Accordingly , the designer may move an external representation within her individual workspace or into and out of a shared workspace . Further , by making an externalization explicitly available , this may also have the meaning that it is shared with someone else . By using embodied actions such as writing or drawing , the designer can also produce a visual representation – as Robertson ( 1991 ) notes , this is typically done on paper . A designer may also highlight an aspect of a physical object such as a sketch or text either within a book , whiteboard or paper sheets . This is typically done by drawing a line with a pen , or by annotation , or even by an ephemeral hand gesture alone . Other ways of highlighting are to mask a background or foreground of an object with some other object such as hands , arms or paper sheets . Eventually , a designer may use a physical object such as looking at a picture , reading a text , turning and holding an object to view it , or feeling and touching an object . Embodied interaction can however also be performed in relation to other bodies . Due to the human ability to implicitly organize and recognize actions in relation to others , this can also be seen as communication behavior . Embodied actions can thus be used for : 1 ) emitting signals and monitor signs , and 2 ) pretending to be another body . Hence , designers may emit signals by indicating involvement , attention and attitude or by changing their body posture , facial expressions or gaze direction . Similarly , nodding , eye - rolling and gestures but also oral indicators can be used for signaling . Designers may also engage in enactment by pretending to be in another body to “live within a temporal representation of some process or activity” ( T . Robertson , 1991 ) . For example , a designer may pretend to be a user , a character in a game , or she may even personify an object or process . In relation to their workspace , designers may engage in actions such as 1 ) moving around , 2 ) pointing at something , 3 ) shifting direction of gaze , and 4 ) moving in or out of shared space ( T . Robertson , 1991 ) . Designers may accordingly move within a design environment to get a better view , to change their bodily alignment , or to get or put an object to a specific location . By pointing at something a designer may index an object somewhere in the workspace , such as an external representation or another person . She may also employ pointing to refer to an object that is somewhere outside of the physical environment or in some direction or orientation . However , as Robertson notes , this is only reasonable if other persons are able to perceive these pointing actions . By changing the direction of gaze , the designer may further follow a conversation , look at an object or person , or may even look at nothing particular . In all cases however , the direction of gaze may be interpreted as some intention by other persons present . Eventually , by moving in and out of a shared space , the designer may temporarily leave the group space to meet with other persons , attend individual responsibilities or for other reasons . Robertson ( 1991 ) argues that group activities rely on the individual embodied interactions discussed above and the mutual perception of those actions by the members of the group . As such , he identified following activities : 1 ) conversing , 2 ) looking at the same thing at the same time , 3 ) organizing shared resources , 4 ) creating shared representations , 5 ) sharing physical use of an object , 6 ) focusing group attention , 7 ) breaking into smaller groups , 8 ) seizing the moment , and 9 ) doing something else . The author further notes that conversing is by far the most important and essential category within his taxonomy of group actions , whereby conversations may differ between a single conversation involving the whole group and conversations within sub - groups or individuals within the same space . By looking at the same thing , designers may however make conversations more robust by referencing a single shared representation or multiple shared representations . Designers may also engage in the activity of organizing shared communication resources by changing the physical arrangement of artifacts that the group is looking at or by creating shared representations such as cooperative drawings at a Analysis 47 whiteboard or by writing words on paper notes . Thereby , designers engage in shared physical use of an object , such as a piece of paper or a whiteboard surface . Simultaneous actions such as a person highlighting a piece of text while the other person is writing or drawing at the same time require coordination and group awareness . Hence , it might be necessary to focus the group’s attention for example during a conversation . The group’s attention may thereby be focused on a shared object or representation , on a person , or on a specific individual or group activity . Another group activity described by Robertson ( 1991 ) is breaking the group into smaller sub - groups or individual activities . Thus , small groups or individual designers may for example work on specific parts while another group or an individual monitors the progress of the group as a whole . This process of work distribution is also often referred to as “coupling” between individual and shared tasks in CSCW literature ( Pinelle , 1996 ) . Thereby , “loose coupling” refers to a weak influence and interdependence of collaborating groups , while “tight coupling” refers to a strong interdependence of groups and hence a greater need for effective coordination . With seizing the moment , Robertson ( 1991 ) further describes unplanned and ad - hoc group activities such as asking a question or explicit social interaction such as telling a joke . Eventually , group members are also frequently doing something else than participating in the group activity either due to their personal interests or disinterest in the group . Throughout the process of design , designer’s embodied interaction hence shape how collaboration and cognition unfolds . By being able to perceive other’s actions and by being able to implicitly communicate with others through embodied actions , the designer’s bodily behavior inherently influences the structure and effectiveness of both individual cognition and collaboration within the design studio . 2 . 2 . 5 Materiality Previously it was discussed how the spatial and social ecology as well as bodily interactions are important aspects of design practice . However , it is to mention here that materiality and persistence are crucial qualities of design material that enable these kinds of structures . For example , it was already mentioned that the affordances of corkboards stimulate collaborative actions like sharing , pointing , looking and re - arranging . Similarly , the affordances of physical artifacts allow moving , gesturing on , highlighting or navigating a particular external representation . The property of persistence further makes these external representations available and accessible to a group of designers that share the same physical location . Hence , material design artifacts typically share affordances for social accessibility , fluency and awareness that support individual and collaborative design work ( Gaver , 1996 ) . Several studies have shown that the variety of properties that define physical artifacts such as spatial aspects ( position , size , shape , proportion ) , the material ( weight , plasticity , rigidity ) and the texture ( rough , smooth ) enable rich embodied interactions that assist certain tasks ( Cook & Bailey , 2005 ; Gaver , 1996 ; Hansen & Dalsgaard , 2012 ; Sellen & Harper , 2003 ) . For example , Sellen and Harper ( 2003 ) found that the use of paper in large organizations facilitates and expands communicative and collaborative resources . Indeed , they argue that paper has become an integral part of organizational work practices and that it is not replaceable by other means such as organizational policies , verbal or electronic communication . For explaining this phenomenon , they use the concept of affordance ( Gibson , 1986 ) for describing how the particular properties of paper artifacts contribute to specific work practices and embodied actions . Gibson ( 1986 ) argues that humans pick up certain information by perceiving physical objects and by attending to what these objects give them for interaction . Hence , an object makes possible certain functions through its properties that are perceived by a person . Most notably , Sellen and Harper ( 2003 ) found evidence within multiple studies on how the Design as Embodied Practice 48 properties of paper such as it being thin , light , porous , opaque and flexible afford reading activities and social coordination ( see Table 2 . 3 ) . Table 2 . 3 : Affordances of paper for reading and social coordination ( Sellen & Harper , 2003 ) . Affordances of paper that support reading Affordances of paper that support social coordination Flexible navigation through documents Controlling access of information Cross - referencing of more than one document at a time Reminding through physical presence Annotate documents easily Portability for meetings Allows interweaving of reading and writing Collaborative accessibility in meetings The lightness and flexibility of paper sheets for example actively supports reading activities by enabling a flexible navigation through documents , such as quickly flipping through pages of a book or magazine . Through the ability to spatially align paper documents next to each other , it is further possible to cross - reference multiple documents at the same time . The physical character of paper further allows annotation of documents with a pen while being engaged in reading activities . Regarding social coordination , Sellen and Harper ( 2003 ) argue that the physical character of paper makes controlling access to information easy , as it affords actions such as sharing , keeping , holding or discarding . The persistence of paper in physical space such as on a pin - board or table also reminds people of particular tasks and activities . Further , through its portability and accessibility that is enabled by its lightness and flexibility ( paper can be stacked , bound or indexed in folders ) it is especially suitable for team meetings as it affords fluent information exchange and ad - hoc annotation or simultaneous manipulation within discussions . The ubiquitous use of paper in creative design practice was reported by Gaver ( 1996 ) and Cook and Bailey ( 2005 ) who investigated the use and benefits of paper as a design material and tool . Designers use paper for brainstorming , annotation , and communication , and choose to use paper over other tools because it is quick , easy , portable and useful in face - to - face collaboration ( Cook & Bailey , 2005 ) . Based on contextual interviews , the authors report following design activities where paper is considered an effective tool : 1 ) communicating ideas , 2 ) soliciting feedback , 3 ) annotating designs , 4 ) sharing at meetings , 5 ) rapid sketching , 6 ) ubiquitous sketching , 7 ) brainstorming , and 8 ) refining ideas . Designers cited the usefulness of paper for communicating ideas to other designers or clients as they typically talk through an idea , which is presented across multiple paper sheets . Paper thereby allows organizing multiple alternative representations spatially to be perceived and discussed at the same time , enabling comparisons and decisions . Further , a designer can efficiently interact socially with a partner by interacting with the paper such as skipping , turning , navigating or annotating . These interactions can also be effective for flexibly adapting a presentation or discussion on the fly . Designers also stated that it is easy to solicit feedback by handing out design artifacts on paper . The directness and persistence of the paper reminds other designers that they should provide feedback . The informal way of grasping and looking at paper also makes feedback an instant process . Another activity afforded by paper is annotation . Designers use annotation for communicating comments or notes to collaborators or for refining their own thoughts . The ease of annotation with pen & paper thereby stimulates the rapid creation of feedback . Cook and Bailey ( 2005 ) also found that designers use paper within meetings as a personal workspace , to take notes and to sketch ideas without disturbing others but also to informally share ideas with others by passing around sheets of paper . The authors also identified the use of paper within rapid idea generation activities such as sketching . Some ideas only Analysis 49 take a couple of seconds to be externalized and may be later discarded when the concept was further elaborated . Designers also stated that ideas come to their mind in different locations such as at work , at home or on the go . Hence , they use paper journals or notebooks for ubiquitous note - taking . Within brainstorming activities , the use of small paper notes is considered best practice , as these are quickly moved and refined , clustered and discarded for iterative rounds of collaboration . Eventually , designers use paper to quickly refine and iterate on ideas . This is supported by the flexibility and spatial characteristics of paper that afford instant externalization and reflection as a working style by enabling the designer to work on multiple representations in parallel and in quick succession . The previous examples have emphasized the role of material artifacts such as paper in embodied design practice . It was shown that physical externalizations and their characteristics allow designers to harness their bodily , spatial and social abilities for supporting creative work practices ( Cook & Bailey , 2005 ; Hansen & Dalsgaard , 2012 ; Vyas , Heylen , & Nijholt , 2008 ) . However , as many scholar note , design also requires the effective and goal - directed use of social , physical and cognitive tools ( Kolko , 2010 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Rittel , 1984 ; Roozenburg & Eekles , 1991 ) . It is only through coordination , experience , learning and establishment of practices that designers and groups of designer make efficient use of their resources for carrying out successful and creative design work . Hence , in the following , the actual procedures , methods and patterns of design work are discussed . 2 . 2 . 6 Design Methods & Activities The process of making use of design resources such as externalizations , spatial and material design environments and embodied actions for achieving a particular goal within the design process is not straightforward . Rather , designers organize and structure their work activities by using “design methods” or “design techniques” ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . Design methods can thereby be considered as tools ( Stolterman et al . , 2008 ) that guide designers through the design process by offering patterns of convergent and divergent activities , or as “a description of a way of working or a recipe for action” ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 , p . 63 ) . In contrast , design techniques describe certain practical solutions to frequently occurring design tasks , or as Löwgren and Stolterman put it : “a technique is smaller in scope and ambition than a method and is frequently related to a particular form of expression or execution” ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 , p . 63 ) . A design method is hence an activity that includes or chooses from different design techniques for accomplishing a certain outcome within the design process . One of the most influential references in the field of design methods is the work by Jones ( 1992 ) , who provides a collection of general design methods and their appropriation and use in different design situations . He thereby characterizes three stages in the design process in which design methods may be applied : 1 ) divergence , 2 ) transformation and 3 ) convergence . Methods for use in divergent design stages may be applied early in the design process when the design objectives are unstable or uncertain , when designers are searching for ideas and when they are exploring design situations . These methods do usually not include evaluation or assessment of design concepts . Methods for transformation in contrast are applied after sufficient divergent activity occurred for exploring problem structures and for arriving at more stable design situations that allow dividing the design problem into well - defined sub - problems . Eventually , within convergent design phases , methods may be applied to reduce complexity and uncertainties by assessing and evaluation design ideas which results in a clear picture of a design problem and its solution . In his book “Design Methods – Seeds of Human Futures” , Jones describes 35 design methods that relate to one or more of these design process steps . Some of the methods may be practiced individually , while many of the described methods involve group coordination and collaboration ( Jones , 1992 ) . Design as Embodied Practice 50 While Jones describes methods related to general design methodology , Löwgren and Stolterman describe a selection of design methods and techniques that are commonly used within traditional design disciplines such as Product Design or Industrial Design but also in HCI and Interaction Design ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 , p . 64ff ) . The authors categorize these methods within the themes of : 1 ) inquiry , 2 ) exploration , 3 ) composition , 4 ) assessment and 5 ) coordination . Table 2 . 4 provides an overview of different methods and techniques from a variety of sources that fit into these themes . It is to mention here that this list is by far not exhaustive , as there are virtually countless methods and techniques and also because their application and appropriation varies between design disciplines . Other researchers for example provide a recent overview and review on methods that are specific to Interaction Design practice ( Biskjaer , Dalsgaard , & Halskov , 2010 ) . In the following , some methods are described in more detail , including their relation to design as embodied practice . Table 2 . 4 : Design Methods and techniques applied within design processes ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ; Buxton , 2007 ; Greenberg et al . , 2012 ; Jones , 1992 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ; Maguire , 2001 ; Osborn , 1953 ) . Inquiry Exploration Composition Assessment Coordination Contextual Inquiry Future Workshop Functional Analysis Prototyping Six Thinking Hats Why - why - why Brainstorming Scenario Testing Process Mapping Focus Group Method 635 Sketching Inspection Documentation Interview Boundary Shifting Storyboarding Contextual Inquiry Incubate / Reflect Active Search Random Input Movie Scenario Argumentation User Research Attribute List Role Playing Design Critique Concrete Stimuli Wizard of OZ Expert Judgment Forced Analogy Within Inquiry , which is situated in the early stages of the design process , designers typically utilize methods for finding out more about a particular design situation or design problem by analyzing information about users , their context and workflows ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . Designers may for example engage in Active Search for investigating design situations by searching for images , by browsing through magazines or looking up demographic data . While this method allows the designer or a team of designers to easily gather information indirectly , it does not involve direct information from the user . Resulting external representations of this activity are for example collections of images , collages of magazine clippings , data visualizations or inspirational images and models that are frequently shared and discussed on whiteboards or other shared surfaces . In contrast to this indirect method of inquiry , direct inquiry methods such as Contextual Inquiry ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) allow for investigating the context of design problems with combinations of interviews and observations involving users or user populations . Beyer and Holtzblatt ( 1997 ) proposed techniques for collecting and interpreting this information , for structuring these interpretations and for approaching a design solution . Representations of contextual inquiry activities are often called affinity diagrams , referring to diagrams of material information artifacts that are clustered on whiteboards or walls and organized into themes based on semantic similarity . Analysis 51 Figure 2 . 12 : Collaborative design activities within inquiry or exploration typically result in collages of material information artifacts , such as affinity diagrams on walls or whiteboards of design studios . 45 Design methods within the theme of Exploration are typically related to activities of inquiry ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . However , while inquiry is concerned with the study of the characteristics of an existing design situation , exploration considers the investigation of what is possible or what might be invented . Design methods for exploration hence focus on generating as many design ideas or solutions as possible , on deriving variations from existing concepts or on forcing re - interpretations of ideas within a design team . Hence , activities of exploration are much more divergent and do not necessarily focus on understanding existing solutions . The authors also emphasize the importance of balancing quality with quantity within these activities , as divergence has a great potential for finding innovative design solutions but also bears potential dangers , as increased variance also makes it harder to recognize good ideas . One of the most popular methods within exploration is called Brainstorming . Initially proposed by Osborn ( 1953 ) and refined and adapted by many others ( Jones , 1992 ; Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) , the method commonly consists of three basic consecutive steps : 1 ) forming a group , 2 ) externalizing ideas without critique , and 3 ) structuring and discussing the results . Using materials such as pen & paper notes and large work surfaces such as tables and walls , ideas are produced , shared and organized within a group of three to seven designers . Researchers also proposed rules that should be followed when practicing brainstorming activities , such as the type of material used , social behavior and turn - taking that typically address issues of design fixation or social dynamics ( see section 2 . 1 . 6 ) to make these activities more effective and productive . It is even argued that structured rules and defined workflows are inevitable to make such explorative group work more effective than individual work ( Pahl , Beitz , Feldhusen , & Grote , 2006 ) . Pahl et al . ( 2006 ) for example describe a brainstorming - based , strictly structured method called Method 635 , which prescribes the number and roles of participants ( 6 ) , the number of ideas to produce by each participant ( 3 ) , and the number of rounds of elaboration ( 5 ) . While this method certainly has advantages in controlling group dynamics and divergence as well as for allowing to identify originators of ideas , Löwgren and Stolterman ( 2007 ) argue that such strictly controlled activities limit creativity and spontaneity that makes group processes more lively . Hence , designers may balance the benefits of structured rules with more openly defined workflows . Within Composition , designers “make a whole out of certain parts” ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 , p . 78 ) by creating external representations of ideas or design solutions . This usually involves a synthesis of functions and features within aesthetic and practicable solutions that address partial requirements or holistic design problems . 4 http : / / www . hcii . cmu . edu / M - HCI / 2006 / MEDRADProject / process - problem - focus . html 5 http : / / wiki . fluidproject . org / download / attachments / 2395197 / 100 _ 1888 . JPG Design as Embodied Practice 52 Figure 2 . 13 : Sketching and storyboarding methods are commonly applied methods of composition , resulting in collections of concrete ideas and design concepts . 6 Storyboards are often pinned on walls or whiteboards to communicate context to a design team . In this process , designers may heavily iterate and try out different compositions or combinations to find an adequate design proposal and balance between contradicting or opposing requirements and solution ideas ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . These divergent as well as convergent methods and techniques are also known within the notion of Sketching . Sketching as a method is very versatile and flexible as it may be practiced and adapted in many different ways ( see section 2 . 2 . 2 ) . While there are virtually countless techniques for sketching , it is most frequently referred to as the activity of creating and shaping a visual representation by hand - drawing techniques or physical shaping techniques . For example , industrial designers may depict the physical shape and function of a product by drawing a simple free - form paper sketch . In interaction design , sketching may also be referred to as a lightweight method for depicting or simulating interactive behavior by using a range of techniques from interface sketches to simple animations , storyboards or functional mock - ups ( Buxton , 2007 ) . Storyboards for example combine scenarios of use and context with sketches by including a series of sequences on how a product might be used in a specific situation . Thereby , they can be used to express intended dynamics of a product or system in a manageable way . Most methods within composition result in externalizations and design artifacts that are used for individual reasoning and reflection , but also within communication and collaboration . As such , compositional artifacts are often publicly displayed within design studios as common reference and repository . As graspable and visible objects of design , they are a foundation to design discourse . However , composition may also be conducted within group sessions . Similar to brainstorming methods , collaborative sketching methods may be controlled and structured for achieving group productivity . Lugt ( 2001 ) for example describes a structure method called Brainsketching that systematically addresses social dynamics , fixation and the re - interpretative nature of sketching activities in group situations ( see section 5 . 1 ) . With direct correlation to composition activities , Assessment methods care for the fact that all design solutions are compromises between requirements and solutions . Hence , methods for assessment regard the appropriateness of design solutions in relation to the intended situation and context of use ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . Assessment is a fundamental activity to determine the success of the design process and for deciding on potential iterations . Within HCI and interaction design , these methods are often referred to as evaluation methods or usability testing techniques that mostly involve the study of user behavior and prototypes of envisioned systems or products . Prototyping for example is a method for envisioning and creating preliminary design solutions that can be actively used and experienced by users , preferably in the direct context of use ( Lim , Stolterman , & Tenenberg , 2008 ) . As such , they provide a vehicle for designers to gather rich feedback from users . However , 6 http : / / media . smashingmagazine . com / wp - content / uploads / 2011 / 12 / 9 . jpg Analysis 53 such prototype evaluations are mostly only applicable in later stages of the design process as they require tremendous efforts in realizing design solutions up to a maturity that enables functional testing . Hence , designers also use assessment methods that do not necessarily involve users or prototypes . For example , Design Critique is a method that can be applied throughout the design process for judging design ideas and solutions ( see Figure 2 . 14 ) . Usually practiced in a collaborative effort , design ideas and solutions may be displayed and discussed , exposing the designs to different views and opinions . Within design critique , the role and expertise of critics is quite important as these individuals may ask unexpected or clarifying questions that may point out unforeseen implications or requirements that have been neglected ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . As such , this method is rather personal and less empirical , involving subjective judgments , skills and values of designers . Figure 2 . 14 : Design critique typically involves collaborative judgment and discussion of design artifacts that are visually displayed on walls or whiteboards ( Buxton , 2007 ) . Documenting and mapping the design process are methods used for coordination 7 . Eventually , methods for Coordination may be applied to guide the overall design process on a meta - level ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . Thereby , these methods and techniques aim at managing the strategy and procedure of design processes , such as task coordination , choice of methods , active reflection and communicating between stakeholders . For example , within Process Mapping designers are creating visual representations of the actual design process , such as process milestones , preliminary results , open issues , applied method history or planned activities in the form of diagrams , maps , schedules , timelines or informal collages of notes ( Dalsgaard , Halskov , & Nielsen , 2008 ) ( compare to Figure 2 . 14 , right ) . Similar to a process model as applied within structured Usability Engineering or Software Engineering , these representations are a common reference for designers to understand , reflect and discuss about the current state of the design process or for guiding and planning future activities . These representations are frequently displayed on persistent shared walls or surfaces to facilitate awareness and communication within design studios . Process mapping can also be seen as a form of Documentation which is a method focused on capturing and documenting the data , representations and artifacts that are generated by design activities so that they can be subjected to analysis and reflection ( Dalsgaard & Halskov , 2012 ) . Thereby , different forms of documentations or collections serve as source of insight and learning , preserving design knowledge and making experiences accessible over a longer period of time and across projects or designers . Dalsgaard and Halskov ( 2012 ) however note , that although documentation can potentially have great benefits for reflective design , it is a method that is rarely applied due to the complexity and dynamics of real world design projects and the large amount of effort that has to be invested into reusable design documentations . 7 http : / / www . flickr . com / photos / o2lu / 2756655639 / sizes / m / in / photostream / Design as Embodied Practice 54 One may summarize that design methods and techniques have in common that they typically rely on specific workflows , rules for productivity and the use of certain tools or materials . The notion of Design Tools thereby relates more to design techniques than to methods as tools typically support specific tasks within design techniques . As such , designers may benefit from the use of design methods in different ways . Firstly , designers benefit from methods in the sense that they provide common ground between different perspectives of different individuals . By providing a common reference and frame for conducting design work , they help facilitate communication and mutual understanding in design teams ( Löwgren & Stolterman , 2007 ) . Secondly , methods are also helpful to organize design work temporally . As design processes tend to be highly iterative and messy in nature , methods give a certain structure and systematic procedure that allows tackling complex issues is a thoughtful way . Thirdly , methods also contribute to the education of novice designers , as they suggest workflows and tools that are proven to be successful in some design situations . Based on this starting point , designers may also adapted methods and techniques for use in different design situations , thereby improving their design skills . However , as Löwgren and Stolterman ( 2007 ) argue , a method in itself does not make the design process better , objective , repeatable or even measurable . Rather , the individual knowledge of the designer is prevalent in all activities , regardless of the methods used . Methods rather support the designer and give guidance and are only one tool among many tools and skills involved in the design process . 2 . 2 . 7 Summary This chapter provided a discussion of the embodied characteristics of design practice by describing commonly applied design practices , materials and design environments . The most important theses put forward by the presented literature review may be summarized as follows : Externalization & Reflection are interconnected activities that enable designers to embody , distribute and extend their cognition and memory into the physical and social environment and across tools and materials . Both activities are characterized by the use of multiple representations and spatial re - arrangements . Sketching is a particular rapid and iterative way of conducting design work that is also often regarded as a style of working that is essential to design thinking . It is characterized as an embodied skill and practice of creating , assessing and re - interpreting of intermediate representations . Design Environments are spatial and material ecologies that support collaborative and individual design activities by providing accessibility and awareness of external representations . They are characterized by different types of material design artifacts and appropriation of space . Embodied Actions are bodily and verbal interactions that designers perform as integral part of design work and collaboration . They shape how collaboration and creativity unfold by providing fluid mechanisms of informal and implicit communication . Materiality is a quality of design artifacts that supports embodied actions , social collaboration and spatial reasoning through affordances of use . Design Methods & Activities assist designers in making effective use of design resources , tools and materials in a structured and controlled workflow . They are characterized by a description of a particular structure , rules and use of tools in a specific design situation . Analysis 55 The conclusions deducted from this literature review regarding the framework this thesis is grounded in are defined in Table 2 . 5 . Table 2 . 5 : Conclusions of this chapter regarding the four themes of the thesis framework . Design as Embodied Practice Externalization Externalization in design practice is inherently embodied and involves rapid and iterative cycles of embodied externalization of intermediate representations . Externalization is supported by embodied actions and the affordances of material design artifacts . Reflection Reflection in design practice is characterized by visual and spatial assessing and re - interpretation of material design artifacts . It is supported by embodied actions and the material , spatial and persistent properties of design environments . Collaboration Collaboration in design practice is facilitated by spatial and material ecologies that provide visibility , persistence and accessibility of external representations such as design studios . Embodied actions facilitate creative fluidity and informal communication . Process Processes in design practice are shaped by design methods and activities that assist designers in choosing material , tools and workflows in a particular design situation .

In a first step , a short review of digital design practice and its potential benefits and challenges is provided . Starting with a summary of commonly used technology in the design process , potential benefits and limitations are discussed . Then , established guidelines and requirements for computational creativity support are reviewed . By further presenting and analyzing related technology - focused research , a discussion of existing limitations and research gaps is provided – leading to a justification of the research question this thesis builds upon . In a second step , a systematic design methodology is devised as an approach to the first research objective . Therefore , existing design methodologies and available technologies that aim at designing embodied interactions are compared and discussed leading to the definition of a custom design methodology that was used within the case studies of the thesis . 3 Technology in the Design Process 58 3 . 1 Technology in the Design Process According to Shneiderman ( 2003 ) , supportive technologies have always been part of problem solving . “A critic might say that creativity is inherently human and no computer could or should be brought into the process . But technology has always been part of the creative process , whether in Leonardo’s paint and canvas or Pasteur’s microscopes and beakers . ” ( Shneiderman , 2003 , p . 230 ) . Creative people hence often benefit from technology to raise their skills and to explore new ways of seeing and doing things . Modern design processes are characterized by the increasing use of digital technology as design medium . For example , in Industrial Design , Interaction Design and Communication Design , digital media is not only more and more used as the target medium for which designers design for , but also as a tool within the design process ( Stappers & Hennessey , 1999a ) . The very nature of digital material suggests that designers use digital tools to assist them in designing for this form of representation . As Stappers notes , technology has dramatically influenced professional practice by supplementing or replacing traditional tools : “Besides all this , the designers’ tools are changing . Computers and software have taken over as the ubiquitous tool for the professional thinking person , driving out the classical paper - based tools of sketching , paper collages , and foam models” ( Stappers , 2005 , p . 96 ) . Computers as design tools may indeed have many advantages over physical media . The following examples seek to demonstrate the potential benefits computer tools may yield within the four themes of design practice as introduced in section 1 . 1 . 1 . Within externalization , digital design tools assist designers in visualizing design concepts and ideas . Using applications such as drawing software ( e . g . SketchBook , Adobe Illustrator ) , Computer Aided Design ( CAD ) and 3D modeling , image manipulation ( e . g . Adobe Photoshop ) and interactive simulations ( e . g . Prototyping tools ) , designers are now able to use more powerful , more compelling and more precise tools for creating visual or interactive representations ( Stappers & Hennessey , 1999a ) . Visualizations created within digital drawing software for example can be very precise , depicting features of an envisioned design idea that are hard to externalize using pen and paper material only . Rich choices of colors , shapes and digital manipulations extend the designer’s repertoire for visual depiction . Further , the interactive nature of digital tools enables depictions of dynamic features such as movement or animations , which are simply not possible with the use of material tools only . At the same time , digital tools provide functionality that makes replication , modification and extension of existing design ideas much easier . For example , modifying images within Photoshop only takes a few clicks and thus stimulates the iterative refinement of externalizations . Due to the described benefits , digital tools for externalization are widely used within professional design practice , especially in the later stages of a design process where depictions are desired to be precise and convincing . Within the theme of reflection , digital technology may also provide benefits over physical design material . Digital design artifacts are created and stored in a digital infrastructure rather than in physical environments . While material representations live on tables , whiteboards or walls , digital design artifacts live in file systems , databases and digital screens . The digital form of design artifacts makes them easy to archive in digital repositories or file systems . Designers are now able to store a very large amount of design ideas and concepts within their computers , potentially supporting reflection over many different ideas , alternatives and development histories over longer periods of time and across different design projects ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast to traditional collages of information on whiteboards or pin - boards , digital storage space is virtually unlimited , providing the possibility to store and archive very large amounts of information . In the physical world however , display space needs to be cleared eventually , requiring the designer to archive design materials in cabinets or boxes which are much less accessible than digital file systems . Hence , designers may Related Research 59 benefit from digital tools that enable retrieval , reuse and presentation of design content for reflection activities ( Mendels , Frens , & Overbeeke , 2011 ) . Hence , interactive presentation tools such as PowerPoint or Keynote are important elements of a designer’s toolbox . Within collaboration , the potential of digital technology is enormous as it allows designers and teams of designers to cooperate in new ways that are enabled by the ability to share and communicate with digital representations . In today’s work practice , digital communication via email or messaging platforms is ubiquitous and thus designers employ digital design artifacts when communicating in various ways ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . Design sketches or digital models for example can be easily shared with others via networks , servers and communication software . This instant , asynchronous as well as synchronous way of conversing via email , blogs , wikis or websites enables new ways of exchanging design ideas beyond traditional face - to - face meetings or co - located discussions . Using technology , designers are now able to collaborate remotely across different locations and structures . Additionally , the Internet has grown to the arguably most important source for inspiration as it provides designers with seemingly unlimited number of design examples ( Herring , Chang , Krantzler , & Bailey , 2009 ) . Yet , these new ways of collaboration and communication do not reduce or replace the need for co - located collaboration in design groups . Hence , designers also employ digital tools that assist them in sharing , discussing and presenting design concepts within a group . For example , interactive whiteboards and large digital displays or projections are more and more becoming an integral part of design meetings . Regarding support for the process of design , digital tools may represent both methods as well as techniques as they propose or suggest a particular task or workflow . Thereby , they can be supportive on a meta - level for organizing and managing design processes or design teams , but also for specific tasks within design processes . For example , technology can be used to capture and document a design process ( Abowd & Mynatt , 2000 ) . The use of digital cameras for archiving design ideas or inspirational artifacts in design process repositories can be useful for coordinating an entire design process . However , as most software is designed with a particular purpose in mind , it mostly supports the designer in a specific task within the design process or in generic tasks such as externalization , communication or presentation . For example , drawing software or image manipulation packages focus on the activity of creating a visual representation while other software such as Powerpoint focus on the presentation of design ideas . While these applications are attuned to the techniques necessary for achieving these tasks , designers also appropriate tools for entirely different purposes ( Stolterman et al . , 2008 ) . Stolterman for example notes “that tools are appropriated by designers in ways that not always equates with the intentions by those who designed the tool” ( Stolterman et al . , 2008 , p . 116 ) . For example , PowerPoint is often appropriated as a prototyping tool in Interaction Design , as its slideshow metaphor doubles as a storyboarding tool , allowing the creation of simple narrations , animations and dynamic walkthroughs . Hence , the use of digital tools within the design process is not straightforward , as adequate appropriation is often crucial to its usefulness within design projects . The above discussed examples can only convey a small sample of digital design practice . Due to the appropriation of digital tools to numerous design tasks and the rapid developments of new design tools , much research is needed to further understand the relation between digital tools and design processes in more detail . However , one may summarize that digital tools can potentially provide many benefits to designers within all themes of design practice . Technology in the Design Process 60 3 . 1 . 1 Digital Tools and Embodied Design Practice Although the benefits of using technology within the design process seem obvious , there are critical issues of integrating these tools into embodied design practices as described within the previous chapter of this thesis . In the following , the limitations of current technology are explored by contrasting the above presented characteristics of digital tools with important features of embodied design practice . Using digital tools for externalizing design ideas clearly leads to different results than using traditional material or physical tools such as pen and paper . As Stappers et al . note , this is due to the nature of most digital design tools , that emphasize fine - tuning operations and refinement for achieving a precise and seemingly final rendering ( Stappers & Hennessey , 1999b ) . Hence , using digital tools such as Photoshop for ideation purposes seems to be a bad fit : “Computer graphics often consists of overprecise straight lines of uniform thickness , or hyper - real renderings conveying a look of lifeless geometry , and leaving no room for expressive techniques such as intended and controlled ambiguity , a quick annotation , or personal style . Computer input devices , most of all the universal mouse and keyboard , are poor when compared to the expressive vocabulary of articulated movement and nuanced tool wielding of the skilled artisan . Computer software interfaces interrupt the fluency of the creative process by requiring the user to select choices from verbalized menus , to enter numerical values for irrelevant parameters , or to repetitively switch software tools using screen buttons . In all these respects , the humble pen and paper are easier and quicker to use , and produce visualisations that are more suited to the needs of the user : to support ideation . ” ( Stappers & Hennessey , 1999b ) . Similar views are shared among many researchers in creativity support ( Igarashi , 2000 ) . One may hence summarize that the benefits in precision offered by digital tools can also yield limitations in activities such as ideation , where other qualities are desired . Within sketching activities for example , the ambiguity of transient representations is more important than a precise depiction , because the representation is created primarily for the purpose of reflection and re - interpretation . Additionally , formal interaction modalities such as precise pointing and text input may also lead to breakdowns of the creative flow that is important in the dynamics of ideation activities . Digital tools hence lack the fluidity and ad - hoc availability and accessibility that are crucial qualities of design material in embodied practice . Other researchers also observed a “rush to final design” when digital tools are used for externalization in the design process ( Marion , Fixson , & Meyer , 2012 ) . The ease of refining representations to perfection thereby hampers the development of alternatives and leads to premature “final” designs . Terry and Mynatt ( 2002 ) blame the predominant single - state document model of desktop applications such as document files and undo - redo mechanisms as key problems that are harmful for exploring alternatives and variations within creative activities . As a result of the above described limitations , designers frequently favor traditional material such as pen and paper for early activities and switch to digital tools only within the final stages of the design process ( Gaver , 1996 ; Igarashi , 2000 ) . Yet , at the same time , they give up on the potential benefits of digital technology such as the ease of documentation , sharing and reuse of design knowledge . Within activities of reflection , digital tools provide inherently different ways for managing , viewing and organizing design artifacts and design knowledge than commonly used spatial work environments . In traditional design environments , the spatial nature of the design studio and its display space facilitate accessibility and awareness of design content not only for individual reflection , but also for group reflection activities . It thereby serves as an extension to the individual and the group’s external memory ( see section 2 . 1 . 6 ) . Lugt ( 2001 ) argues that not only the modalities of interaction as discussed Related Research 61 in the previous paragraph , but also the organizational nature of digital design artifacts is a problem . While file systems and digital storage space is virtually unlimited and allows archiving and retrieving a very large amount of design content for reflection , digital tools have limitations regarding the visibility , accessibility and fluency that are crucial qualities of design artifacts in physical space . The hierarchical nature of file systems hides artifacts within folders and lists , which makes them hard to visualize and compare side - by - side ( Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . This however is a very important activity within reflection , where insights and knowledge are primarily created by exploring , comparing , contrasting and navigating multiple design artifacts at the same time . According to Hollan et al . ( 2000 ) , the ability of spatial arrangement simplifies choice , perception and internal computation . If these properties are limited , humans cannot make use of their spatial thinking capabilities . The intangibility of digital artifacts further makes them harder to access in a fluent and ad - hoc manner , which is crucial in the dynamics of creative work situations . Furthermore , as digital material is accessible only through explicit retrieval , this may lead to a lack of awareness and also inhibits serendipitous experiences , such as being inspired by collages of images on an ambient whiteboard . As a result , designers tend to use a combination of digital and physical design artifacts for their reflection activities . Paper printouts of digital material are frequently being used to cope with the lack of visual and spatial information management in computer systems ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . While this practice solves some of the discussed issues , it also leads to frequent transitions between digital and physical representations , which in turn hamper the fluidity of the design process and accompanying physical / digital workflows ( Hollan et al . , 2000 ) . During collaborative activities in the design process , technology provides new ways of communication that are impossible to achieve using traditional material only . However , digital sharing and remote access to design artifacts are most useful in scenarios of distant and asynchronous collaboration . In contrast , these technologies do not support the most effective forms of collaboration within co - located face - to - face activities . Rather , the use of computers and graphical user interfaces in these situations is frequently considered harmful for informal and creative group work practices ( Hollan et al . , 2000 ) . Hollan et al . ( 2000 ) note that traditional direct - manipulation software systems often fail in group situations because they do not support “the ways that people use representations to do work” ( Hollan et al . , 2000 ) . According to the authors , the source of this deficit is the lack of spatiality , physicality and immediacy that is imposed by screen - based digital representations such as icons , windows and folders or lists . As collaborating individuals use embodied strategies of coordination which are typically bound to physical and spatial representations , gestures and speech , using desktop - based direct manipulation software within group situations hence effectively limits the ability to apply these strategies within a group activity . As previously discussed ( see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) , embodied actions are also a crucial part of design practice . Accordingly , many researchers do not recommend the use of screen - based computer systems within collaborative design activities ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ; Lawson , 2005 ; Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . Lugt ( 2001 ) even argues that “computer - supported idea generation techniques like ' group decision rooms ' , obstruct access to the remote areas of the group ' s external memory . Consequently , the use of these computer systems leads to poorly integrated idea generation . ” ( Lugt , 2001 ) . Criticism of other researchers also concerns the socially intrusive nature of computer systems when used in group situations . Due to the fact that most currently used digital design tools as well as input and output devices are designed for individual use , they are not suitable for informal simultaneous collaborative work on design artifacts ( Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . As a result , collaborating individuals are frequently isolated behind their private screens , leading to breakdowns of communication that is vital for a shared understanding in the group . Eventually , digital design tools also have an impact on the way in which design activities and design processes are followed and practiced . Thereby , researchers are concerned about the positive and Technology in the Design Process 62 negative effects of digital tools on the effectiveness and efficiency of design methods and design techniques ( Marion et al . , 2012 ) . As already discussed , technology appropriation is a potentially very powerful tool that allows the introduction of new and radically different design methods that are not feasible with traditional tools ( Stolterman et al . , 2008 ) . However , design tools often fail in imitating or replicating existing design methods that have a precisely structured and well - defined workflow such as collaborative methods like affinity diagramming or sketching sessions ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ; Newman & Landay , 2000 ) . As discussed in the previous chapter ( see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) , the workflows and tools used for these methods can be very important , as they have a particular strong impact on the cognitive and social dynamics within group collaboration . A change of practice by the introduction of digital workflows that deviate from the original procedure may have unforeseeable consequences which can be either positive or negative . Hence , there is a lively discussion if and how digital tools can be indeed helpful in improving traditionally embodied design practices and processes ( Stappers , 2005 ) . As will be discussed within the proceedings of this chapter , exploring the tension between digital tools and embodied practices is a major open research issue . It is also to mention here that the use of digital tools for augmenting , capturing and monitoring design activities in an unobtrusive way is often considered most promising ( Abowd & Mynatt , 2000 ; Igarashi , 2000 ) . Using technology as assistance rather than as a replacement provides benefits to designers without sacrificing physical or material qualities . At the same time however , the potential benefits of digital tools are rather limited . As a result , the use of digital tools in the design process always brings a tradeoff which needs to be considered carefully . As a result of the previous analysis and discussion , Table 3 . 1 summarizes the main findings regarding the relation of digital tools to embodied design practices . Within all themes of design practice as discussed earlier within this thesis , digital tools present both benefits as well as potential conflicts related to embodied practices . Consequently , there is a lot of potential in designing new tools that explicitly address the described conflicts by proposing and evaluating tradeoffs between digital and material work practices . The result of successful tradeoffs can be tools that on the one hand closely fit embodied practices and traditional workflows while on the other hand also providing benefits yielded by digital tools and vice versa . It is crucial to note here that the design of such tradeoffs is the driving idea behind the research question proposed within this thesis .

Some work has also proposed requirements and guidelines for the design of computer systems that are to be used in situations that are less formal than classical engineering work . In the following , recommendations and design guidelines for digital tools to support creative activities are hence briefly reviewed . Among the first researchers to advocate a focus on creativity support in HCI and software design were Candy , Edmonds , Shneiderman , Terry and Mynatt ( Candy & Edmonds , 2000 ; Shneiderman , 2003 ; Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . Emerging from a conference series on Creativity & Cognition , Candy and Edmonds proposed a research agenda toward a new discipline of creativity and technology that is concerned with an interdisciplinary approach to software design . The authors argue that an understanding of creative and reflective work practices as well as the requirements of future digital technologies is needed for grounding research on new design tools . Later , Shneiderman ( 2002 , 2003 ) presented “a vision of how software could enable more people to be more creative more of the time” ( Shneiderman , 2003 , p . 208 ) . Inspired by different historic views on creativity and specifically by the work and life of Leonardo Da Vinci , Shneiderman derived and defined generic activities that are inherently related to creative work and problem solving . According to the author , software that aims to support creative problem solving may support following tasks ( Shneiderman , 2003 ) : 1 ) Searching – browsing digital resources for inspiration 2 ) Visualizing – understanding and discovering relationships 3 ) Consulting – intellectual and emotional support from mentors of peers 4 ) Thinking – making new combinations by free association 5 ) Exploring – what - if tools and simulations 6 ) Composing – step by step artifact creation 7 ) Reviewing – reflecting upon histories and sessions 8 ) Disseminating – gaining recognition and sharing resources Shneiderman situated these activities within three perspectives on creativity , namely inspirational , structural and situational . For example , the first three activities of searching , visualizing and consulting are more related to the inspirationalist approach to creativity , which emphasizes external influences as the sources of insights . In contrast , the activities of thinking , exploring and composing emphasize the structuralist path that aims to understand and simulate in order to exhaustively explore alternative solutions . Eventually , reviewing and disseminating aim toward the situationalist approach which emphasizes the relation of own works to that of others . Each perspective may lead to different outcomes , and as Shneiderman argues , many creative activities are actually composed of these tasks within an iterative process . Software may hence drive creativity by supporting one or more of these tasks but also by integrating these tasks in the overall workflow . If tools are designed without related activities in mind , they will eventually fail in the creative process due to the need for rapid alternations and dynamics . Shneiderman ( 2003 ) notes that general purpose software already gives much value within the tasks of searching , visualizing , consulting and disseminating . Hence , he argues for focused research efforts in particular within thinking by free association , exploring , composing and reviewing . He gives some examples on how new tools might improve these tasks . He argues that the most common task , thinking by free association is indeed poorly supported by digital tools . Hence , he claims for supporting lateral thinking by allowing the user to explore multiple possibilities and approaches instead of pursuing a single solution . Similarly , user interfaces as simulation tools may allow users to run thought experiments to reason about potential implications of their decisions . Within composing , Shneiderman discusses tools that provide adequate forms of externalization that are directly related to Technology in the Design Process 64 the design domain , such as sketching tools for early depictions of design concepts . Eventually , within reviewing he notes that digital tools may provide keen benefits by keeping histories of sessions and activities for later review . By recording not only the results of creative activities but also the path and decisions , users may edit and replay histories in order to learn about their work practices and patterns as part of reflective practice . These recommendations fit into all themes of design practice as described within the previous chapters . Hence , they are also in line with findings from the analysis of creative practices within this thesis ( see section 2 . 2 . 7 ) . Inspired by reflective practice as described by Schön ( 1983 ) , Terry and Mynatt ( 2002 ) , presented a study on the use of digital tools by creative practitioners . From their findings , they derived recommendations and guidelines for the design of more adequate design tools . According to their investigation , creative processes require three activities that are non - linear and highly iterative : 1 ) experimentation , 2 ) exploration of variations and 3 ) continual evaluation of progress . Within experimentation , designers try different actions to see if one step leads to a promising discovery for further steps . This resonates with the concept of reflection - in - action ( Schön , 1983 ) , where hypotheses are tested and evaluated in frequent cycles . By further exploring alternative solutions or variations , the designer understands the situation by comparing results side - by - side in the form of a conversation . This may either happen sequentially or in parallel . Regarding continuous evaluation the designer utilizes different representations or multiple states for long - term evaluation in the sense of reflection - on - action . Software may hence support creativity by providing tools that aid people within these practices . Terry and Mynatt ( 2002 ) argue that today’s user interfaces do not explicitly support such tasks due to the predominant single - state document model and hierarchical file systems . For example , desktop software typically provides only one state of a document to the user at a time ( e . g . Photoshop file ) . By the use of redo and undo mechanisms , designers are applying sequential steps that lead to a refinement of the document . However , this practice harms near - term experimentation , as it hides the variations that were explored within the process of creation . Accordingly , the designer does not have a reasonable way of comparing and re - evaluating the design process – leading to mostly linear progression . A typical workaround for coping with this lack of support is the creation of variations within multiple files in a folder structure . Yet , exactly this leads to a lack of parallel visibility that is required for side - by - side comparisons . According to the authors , file systems lack support for multiple views and layout tools for spatial reasoning . They hence propose the following guidelines to better support creative processes : 1 ) support comparisons or multiple views , 2 ) reduce the need for redo and undo , and 3 ) capture histories of design sessions . For example , comparisons can be supported by providing interface components or layouts that allow multiple design concepts to be displayed in parallel . Accordingly , this can best be achieved by providing and harnessing extensive display space ( Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . Redo and undo can be reduced by providing tools that allow previews of the tool’s effect or by enabling the manipulation of crucial parameters after creation ( e . g . change thickness of stroke after drawing a line ) . Eventually , the authors propose that histories of design sessions may be captured automatically and shall be presented in an adequate way for long - term evaluation . Promising concepts can for example be found in magic lenses ( Bier , Stone , Pier , Buxton , & DeRose , 1993 ) that can be used on demand for in - place comparisons , previews and histories . Overall , Terry and Mynatt’s guidelines focus on the design of interface concepts within the themes of externalization , reflection and process , rather than on collaboration . Similar guidelines and recommendations that complement or extend the above described issues were also proposed by other researchers ( Bederson , 2004 ; Hewett , 2005 ; Igarashi , 2000 ; H . Johnson & Carruthers , 2006 ; Yamamoto & Nakakoji , 2005 ) . For example , Bederson ( 2004 ) focused on supporting the flow principle in software design for providing an optimal experience . The author proposed following design guidelines : 1 ) engage the user in tasks by balancing skills and challenges 2 ) Related Research 65 design for concentration and avoid interruptions ( e . g . by using transitions and animations , or by reducing mode switching ) , 3 ) give the user control by adaptation and customization , and 4 ) provide clear goals and instant feedback . Guidelines such as those proposed by Yamamoto & Nakakoji ( 2005 ) focus on the modalities and styles of interaction for supporting informal creative activities . The author proposes three design guidelines : 1 ) provide interpretation - rich representations , 2 ) provide representations with constant grounding , and 3 ) use hands - on interaction methods for generation and manipulation of representations . Interpretation - rich representation thereby means that the externalizations created by the digital tool should have some kind of ambiguity , so that they can be interpreted in different ways ( e . g . hand - drawn sketches ) . The author further refers to constant grounding as a quality of digital representations that provides context and projection to a designer . This is a requirement for allowing users of design tools to ground their current work within the larger design process . Eventually , hands - on interaction refers to the perceptual and bodily skills of a creative person that need to be supported by digital design tools . In particular , the author states that “a designer has to be able to feel as if he / she interacts with the representations rather than with the computer system ; computer systems need to stay invisible to the user . ” ( Yamamoto & Nakakoji , 2005 , p . 523 ) . This requirement resonates with the previously discussed importance of support for harnessing the embodied cognition abilities of designers . A workshop on creativity support tools in 2005 gathered key researchers in the field to discuss and synthesize guidelines and to propose research approaches and methods . The workshop report provides 12 rather general and high - level design principles for research in new creativity support tools ( Shneiderman , Fischer , et al . , 2006 ) : 1 ) support exploration , 2 ) low threshold , high - ceiling , and wide walls , 3 ) support many paths and many styles , 4 ) support collaboration , 5 ) support open interchange , 6 ) make it as simple as possible , 7 ) choose black boxes carefully , 8 ) invent thing you would want to use yourself , 9 ) balance user suggestions with observation and participation , 10 ) iterate , iterate , then iterate again , 11 ) design for designers , and 12 ) evaluation of tools . From these , the principles 1 to 7 are similar or identical to those already discussed by others ( Shneiderman , 2003 ; Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ; Yamamoto & Nakakoji , 2005 ) . Yet , the report also includes valuable details on how to do research in the area of creativity support tools as the principles 8 to 12 explicitly address the research and development cycle for design tools . It is argued here that the complex nature of creativity requires different research methods than traditional approaches . According to the report , approaches such as observations and participatory design are to be preferred rather than relying on user suggestions only . Similarly , iterations should also find their way into research processes rather than following a strictly linear process . The recommendations also concern evaluation methods . For example , because there is a lack of definition on how to measure if a digital tool actually supports creative practices , there are no reliable methods of measuring success on a level of productivity , efficiency and quality ( Shneiderman , Fischer , et al . , 2006 ) . Accordingly , the report recommends longitudinal studies in real - life context rather than controlled lab experiments . While the above presented guidelines clearly focus on individual use , there are also recommendations specifically for the design of collaborative design tools ( Gross & Do , 2007 ; Herrmann , 2009 ; Randall , Salembier , & Herrmann , 2010 ; Warr & O’Neill , 2007 ) . Based on personal experiences from a decade of research within shared drawing surfaces , virtual environments and shared physical - digital spaces , Gross and Do ( 2007 ) proposed the “BE - FAT” design principles for the design of collaborative design tools : 1 ) Buoyancy , 2 ) Efficacy , 3 ) Fluency , 4 ) Advocacy , and 5 ) Transparency . Thereby , buoyancy is the ease and fluency of adoption and appropriation of the tool . It should be easy to walk up and use the tool as required for casual and frequent engagements . Efficacy means that the tool has an effect that contributes to the intended activity ( adequate functionality ) . Similar to the guidelines proposed by Bederson ( 2004 ) , fluency proposes that the digital tool should have smooth transitions Technology in the Design Process 66 between states or modes of operation in order to reduce distractions . Advocacy is the ability of the tool to facilitate or invite interactions from people . This can for example be achieved by designing affordances to actively stimulate participation . Eventually , the transparency principle should make the functionality of the tool obvious to the users . Hence , the tool should be designed in a way to facilitate collaboration without getting in the way of established design practices . Although these guidelines are quite abstract , they contribute to the general design space within all themes of design practice . Warr ( 2007 ) presented high - level requirements for creative collaboration that focus specifically on the externalization of knowledge and the individual and social aspects of design work . Based on an extensive literature review and additional findings from experiments , the author proposes an overall set of 23 requirements for the design of tools to support creative collaboration . For supporting externalization , following requirements are put forward : 1 ) support the creation of sketches 2 ) support the annotation of sketches 3 ) support the creation of text 4 ) support pointing interactions with externalizations 5 ) support gesturing interactions with externalizations 6 ) support generation of alternatives ( divergence ) 7 ) support the refinement of ideas ( convergence ) 8 ) do not constrain the ways of externalizing ideas ( e . g . provide different styles and freeform input ) 9 ) provide an unobstructed solution space ( allow bodily movements ) 10 ) allow users to change the orientation and position of externalizations 11 ) support the combination of previously generated ideas 12 ) support the storage and protection of created externalizations 13 ) support the comparison of created ideas For supporting individual and social activities , Warr ( 2007 ) proposes following requirements : 1 ) support individual activities using small interaction spaces 2 ) support sub - group activities using interaction spaces that create a sense of social inclusion 3 ) support group activities by using large interaction spaces 4 ) support the transition between individual and group activities 5 ) support creative activities beyond the meeting room ( e . g . after meeting ) 6 ) support synchronous forms of interaction ( avoid production blocking ) 7 ) support multiple forms of input ( reducing production blocking ) 8 ) remove identity from user contributions ( reduce evaluation apprehension ) 9 ) support individual private interactions ( reduce effects of evaluation apprehension and free - riding ) 10 ) make individual contributions accountable ( reduce free riding ) The requirements put forward by Warr ( 2007 ) are especially relevant for the research at hand as they specifically address social dynamics in design and the importance of externalizations in divergent as well as convergent activities . They also resemble many of the findings derived within the previous chapter ( see section 2 . 1 ) . However , they lack details concerning task or workflow support and details on reflection support . Herrmann ( 2009 ) presented five “design heuristics for computer supported collaborative creativity” that are based on a literature review , several workshops and interviews with practitioners : 1 ) Related Research 67 Supporting the larger picture – the visualization of rich material , 2 ) malleability of shared material and stimulation of variations , 3 ) support convergence with evolutionary documentation , 4 ) smooth transitions between different modes of collaboration , and 5 ) integration of communication with work on shared material . Within visualization , Herrmann ( 2009 ) proposes that a digital tool should provide a large picture of the group’s work and that it should provide enough display space to allow designers flexible arrangement and access to design artifacts ( e . g . digital whiteboard ) . Malleability means that the material that represents design concepts should be flexible and ambiguous in the sense that it is open for changes or revisions at any time . Support for convergence and documentation is a requirement for merging and condensing information within convergent activities ( e . g . after brainstorming ) . A collaborative design tool should provide easy tools to document results without the need for an additional time - consuming process . Similar to other researchers , Hermann ( 2009 ) also proposes to make transitions between states or modes of a system as unobtrusive as possible for supporting different phases and modes of collaboration , such as alternations between closely - coupled collaboration and loosely - coupled collaboration . Eventually , verbal communication should be seen as part of the system design , not just the work on design artifacts . Hence , the role of facilitators or special roles such as individuals that are responsible for documentation may be actively supported by the creativity support system . Table 3 . 2 : Summary of guidelines within the themes of design practice based on [ 1 ] ( Shneiderman , 2003 ) , [ 2 ] ( Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) , [ 3 ] ( Bederson , 2004 ) , [ 4 ] ( Yamamoto & Nakakoji , 2005 ) , [ 5 ] ( Shneiderman , Fischer , et al . , 2006 ) , [ 6 ] ( Gross & Do , 2007 ) , [ 7 ] ( Warr , 2007 ) , and [ 8 ] ( Herrmann , 2009 ) , [ 9 ] ( Igarashi , 2000 ) . Externalization Reflection Collaboration Process Fluent interfaces for exploring ideas [ 2 , 3 , 5 ] Hands - on interaction [ 4 , 8 ] Hide interface from the user [ 4 , ] Avoid interruptions [ 3 , 6 ] Man paths , many styles [ 5 ] Annotation , pointing , gesturing [ 7 ] Design for divergence [ 4 , 8 ] Reduce undo and redo [ 3 , 5 ] Provide storage for externalizations [ 1 , 7 ] Design for convergence [ 1 , 7 ] Use interpretation - rich , imprecise representations [ 4 ] Provide constant grounding [ 4 ] Use display space for visualizing and comparing ideas [ 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 ] Provide multiple views [ 2 ] Support the combination of ideas [ 2 , 7 , 8 ] Design walk - up and use systems [ 6 ] Fluent transitions between collaboration modes [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] Invite interactions by using adequate affordances [ 6 , 8 ] Open interchange [ 5 ] Respect social factors [ 7 ] Provide individual and group spaces [ 7 , 8 ] Support bodily movements [ 7 ] Design for and with designers as users [ 5 ] Respect established work practices [ 1 , 4 , 6 , 9 ] Keep histories of sessions and the design process [ 1 , 2 , 9 ] Use unobtrusive or automatic documentation functionality [ 2 , 8 ] Communication as part of the workflow [ 8 ] Before concluding this review , it is to mention that none of the guidelines discussed above are empirically proven . This issue is based on the fact that creative work processes are hard to measure and compare due to their dynamics and the differences in individual creative ability and skill ( Hewett , 2005 ) . As a result , evidence within the field of creativity support research is mostly episodic and frequently based on observations or subjective feedback from participants . Hence , the research area is far from being sufficiently conceptualized and described . Additionally , many of the authors ground their guidelines in their own experiences only and – with some notable exceptions – do not propose concrete interaction concepts or interfaces that may address these guidelines . Hence , the above presented design recommendations should be taken as proposals rather than rules to be strictly Technology in the Design Process 68 followed . For synthesizing the various guidelines within the context of this thesis , Table 3 . 2 presents an overview on guidelines and recommendation within the thesis framework . For each theme of the framework , guidelines , requirements or recommendations are available that may assist designers or researcher when designing new tools . 3 . 1 . 3 Research on Digital Design Tools Besides a large number of guidelines , researchers have also developed concrete tools and environments to support creative activities and design processes . Thereby , they created diverse user interfaces and interaction techniques that relate to the above discussed requirements and guidelines . In the following , an historic overview on these research efforts and in particular on noteworthy or especially influential tools in the domain of design and creativity support will be given . Subsequently , tools that are directly related to the research question will be analyzed according to the criteria within the thesis framework . This analysis is eventually used to justify the research gap and to highlight the need for new interaction techniques and system designs . Figure 3 . 1 : Timeline of existing research in design tools and creativity support systems . Works that are particularly related to this research are emphasized in bold font . An extensive literature review revealed that existing research within design tools and creativity support is quite diverse and wide - ranging . Developed concepts and prototypes range from isolated interaction techniques , over single - user applications to full - featured systems or environments for design teams . As this diversity makes understanding the field quite complex , the following review seeks to provide some structure by introducing categories in which existing research is being classified . Hence , the review is structured according to the categories of Visualization and Informal Externalization ( desktop metaphor / GUI - based ) , Large Display Systems , Multiple Display Systems , 1990 2012 2000 1995 2005 EMS ( Nunamaker et al . , 1991 ) Clearboard ( Ishii , 1992 ) Tivoli ( Moran , 1993 ) TechBox ( IDEO , 1999 ) Flatland ( Mynatt et al . , 1999 ) iiii - - - - LAND ( LAND ( LAND ( LAND ( StreitzStreitzStreitzStreitzet al . , 1999 ) et al . , 1999 ) et al . , 1999 ) et al . , 1999 ) EDC / EDC / EDC / EDC / CarettaCarettaCarettaCaretta ( Arias et al . , 2000 / 2005 ) ( Arias et al . , 2000 / 2005 ) ( Arias et al . , 2000 / 2005 ) ( Arias et al . , 2000 / 2005 ) The The The The Designer‘sDesigner‘sDesigner‘sDesigner‘sOutpostOutpostOutpostOutpost ( Klemmer et al . , 2001 / 2002 ) ( Klemmer et al . , 2001 / 2002 ) ( Klemmer et al . , 2001 / 2002 ) ( Klemmer et al . , 2001 / 2002 ) The The The The Designer‘sDesigner‘sDesigner‘sDesigner‘sEnvironment ( Tse et al . , 2008 ) Environment ( Tse et al . , 2008 ) Environment ( Tse et al . , 2008 ) Environment ( Tse et al . , 2008 ) Calico ( Mangano et al . , 2008 ) Shared Design Space ( Brandl et al . , 2006 ) GAMBIT ( GAMBIT ( GAMBIT ( GAMBIT ( SangiorioSangiorioSangiorioSangiorioet al . , 2012 ) et al . , 2012 ) et al . , 2012 ) et al . , 2012 ) NootNootNootNoot ( Dijk , 2011 ) ( Dijk , 2011 ) ( Dijk , 2011 ) ( Dijk , 2011 ) Anoto Co - Sketching ( Malmborg et al . , 2004 ) SCWID ( Cook et al . , 2005 ) CoWall ( Löwgren , 2005 ) CabinetCabinetCabinetCabinet ( Keller et al . , 2006 ) ( Keller et al . , 2006 ) ( Keller et al . , 2006 ) ( Keller et al . , 2006 ) FunkyWall ( Lucero et al . , 2008 ) Diamond‘s Edge ( Bernstein et al . , 2006 ) TEAMStormTEAMStormTEAMStormTEAMStorm ( ( ( ( HailpernHailpernHailpernHailpern et al . , 2007 ) et al . , 2007 ) et al . , 2007 ) et al . , 2007 ) BrainStormBrainStormBrainStormBrainStorm ( Hilliges et al . , 2007 ) ( Hilliges et al . , 2007 ) ( Hilliges et al . , 2007 ) ( Hilliges et al . , 2007 ) MemTableMemTableMemTableMemTable ( Hunter et al . , 2011 ) ( Hunter et al . , 2011 ) ( Hunter et al . , 2011 ) ( Hunter et al . , 2011 ) PictionairePictionairePictionairePictionaire ( Hartmann et al . , 2010 ) ( Hartmann et al . , 2010 ) ( Hartmann et al . , 2010 ) ( Hartmann et al . , 2010 ) The Nice The Nice The Nice The Nice DiscussionDiscussionDiscussionDiscussion RoomRoomRoomRoom ( Haller et al . , 2010 ) ( Haller et al . , 2010 ) ( Haller et al . , 2010 ) ( Haller et al . , 2010 ) SPPD ( SPPD ( SPPD ( SPPD ( WarrWarrWarrWarret al . , 2007 ) et al . , 2007 ) et al . , 2007 ) et al . , 2007 ) Cognoter ( Foster , 1986 ) Incremental Formalization ( Shipman et al . , 1994 / 1995 ) eMMa ( Nakakoji et al . , 1997 ) FreedFreedFreedFreed ( Mendels et al . , 2011 ) ( Mendels et al . , 2011 ) ( Mendels et al . , 2011 ) ( Mendels et al . , 2011 ) ARTware ( Yamamoto et al . , 2001 ) SideViews ( Terry et al . , 2002 ) Parallel Pies / Paths ( Terry et al . , 2004 ) Visualization Electronic Cocktail Napkin ( Do & Gross , 1996 ) Patchwork ( Kant , 1998 ) SILK ( Landay et al , 1996 ) Denim ( Lim et al . , 2000 ) DEMAIS ( Bailey et al . , 2001 ) Informal Externalization Large Displays Multiple Displays Physical / Tangible Liveboard ( Elrod , 1992 ) DAMASK ( Lim et al . , 2003 ) Post - Brainstorm ( Guimbretiere et al . , 2001 ) Idea Playground ( Pertender et al . , 2012 ) ModLab ( Herrmann et al . , 2010 ) CollaborageCollaborageCollaborageCollaborage ( Moran et al . , 1999 ) ( Moran et al . , 1999 ) ( Moran et al . , 1999 ) ( Moran et al . , 1999 ) Affinity Note Finder ( Harboe et al . , 2012 ) CAM ( Vyas et al . , 2010 ) Ideas Design Ecology ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) IdeaSpaces ( Bailey et al . , 2009 ) Design Team Mate ( Martens et al . , 2010 ) TeleBoard ( Meinel et al . , 2011 ) DazzleDazzleDazzleDazzle ( ( ( ( OehlbergOehlbergOehlbergOehlberg et al . , 2012 ) et al . , 2012 ) et al . , 2012 ) et al . , 2012 ) Remote / Web - based Design Design Horizon ( Terry et al . , 2004 ) Related Research 69 Physical / Tangible Systems , and Remote / Web - based Systems . Thereby , the particular foci of selected works are discussed along with similar research within the same category . For the sake of limiting scope and for providing consistency , only prior works that explicitly refer to the domains of creativity and design are included within this review . Figure 3 . 1 depicts a timeline of the works that are included in the review . Additional works such as interaction techniques from other domains than design that are however also related to the research within this thesis are discussed along with the case studies where appropriate . Visualizations One of the first researchers that focused on supporting creative and reflective processes by providing adequate visualizations were Shipman & McCall , ( 1994 ) . Inspired by the lack of support for informality in computer systems , they developed an application that supports incremental formalization . Thereby , the tool captures and presents informal data and further allows users to refine and formalize this data in a step - by - step and iterative way . The authors explicitly refer to the nature of creative activities and the need for expressing informal and transient knowledge . In successive research , Shipman et al . ( 1995 ) developed a tool that facilitates information management by providing a spatial visualization for categorizing and organizing informal information . Their tool design aids creativity as it allows users to express knowledge spatially without imposing a pre - defined linear structure such as lists , grids or folders . The structure may be added to the information in an ad - hoc and iterative way , thereby enabling the user to combine elements and to discover new relationships among information items . Spatial information organization was also used by the ARTware systems presented by Nakakoji et al . ( 2000 ) and Yamamoto et al . ( 2000 ) which support users in formulating “what - if” questions by positioning objects and by representing relationships between these objects ( see Figure 3 . 2 ) . The tools emphasize the importance of informal spatial positioning within a graphical user interface as a mean for visualizing concepts for reflective processes . Similar tools for visual hypothesis testing were also developed by others . The tools Parallel Paths and Parallel Pies facilitate the exploration and development of multiple solutions in parallel ( Terry , Mynatt , Nakakoji , & Yamamoto , 2004 ; Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) . Users may generate , manipulate and compare alternatives within a single user interface . They hence contribute to reflective processes by providing means of visualization that may provide insights for the paths taken and may assist in decisions on potential future paths to follow . With the tool SideViews ( Terry et al . , 2004 ) , the researchers also support near - term experimentation and evaluation by displaying visual previews of potential future states of the system . Using this approach , users can evaluate their decisions before they commit to a particular action . Consequently it serves as creativity support in the sense that it facilitates the understanding and exploration of the design space . The matching tool Design Horizon ( Terry & Mynatt , 2002 ) is a visual workspace in which variants can be positioned spatially to allow for comparisons ( see Figure 3 . 2 ) . Recent research by Mendels et al . ( 2011 ) extended this approach toward not only the visualization of artifact states but toward the visualization of the entire design process . The tool Freed allows designers to collect and visualize collections of design artifacts within multiple views on a graph - based mind - map - like layout ( see Figure 3 . 2 ) . The graphical user interface thereby explicitly supports creative thought processes by enabling visual explorations and reflections by means of documentation and dynamic visualization . Similar concepts of visual and spatial layouts on desktop interfaces are also employed in commercially available mind - mapping tools such as XMind 8 or Mindjet 9 . The discussed approaches all have in common that they use visual and spatial layout mechanisms to avoid the limitations of more formal and strict graphical user interfaces . Similar approaches were also 8 http : / / www . xmind . net / 9 http : / / www . mindjet . com / Technology in the Design Process 70 introduced for larger displays and environments , which will be discussed in the proceedings of this chapter . Figure 3 . 2 : Time - ART ( left ) , Design Horizon ( center ) and Freed ( right ) . Visualizations for supporting creative activities often make use of spatial layout techniques for design exploration and reflection . The spatial arrangement and repositioning of visual items stimulates comparisons and the exploration of variations and alternatives ( compare to spatial arrangements on traditional whiteboards or walls ) . Informal Externalization A particular popular research focus was also recognized in supporting informal externalization of design ideas . SILK ( Sketching Interfaces Like Krazy ) ( Landay , 1996b ) is a software tool that introduced free - form sketching as input modality for user interface designers ( see Figure 3 . 3 ) . It addresses the need for imprecision and fluency that is required for depicting early and vague design ideas . Similar to the system presented by Shipman and McCall ( 1994 ) , SILK supports the designer with incremental formalization and refinement by recognizing interface components based on roughly sketched shapes . Using the tool , designers can incrementally explore and formalize interface variants without the cost of time - consuming formal construction . Used in conjunction with pen input devices , the tool was an important research milestone that brought computers closer to the fluent and informal nature of traditional pen and paper tools by still providing computational benefits . SILK was followed by a family of systems that also focused on sketch - based interaction modalities such as Patchwork ( Kant , Wilson , Bekker , Johnson , & Johnson , 1998 ) and others ( see G . Johnson , Gross , Hong , & Yi - Luen Do , 2007 for a review of sketch - based design tools ) . Gross ( 1996 ) for example presented a tool called The Electronic Cocktail Napkin . Similar to SILK , the tool recognizes and interprets primitive sketches for assisting free - form “tinkering and doodling” . It further features design critique , simulation and information retrieval functionality . A further closely related design tool is DENIM ( Lin , Newman , Hong , & Landay , 2000 , 2001 ) , which extends SILK by providing the designer with an ink - based interaction model and a zoomable user interface ( ZUI ) ( see Figure 3 . 3 ) . The ZUI thereby unifies different levels of refinement and abstraction , allowing the designer to explore and compare variants within different levels through zooming . It effectively addressed the problem of formal interfaces that usually require the user to make premature decisions . Instead , its spatial layout on a zoomable canvas supports explorations and comparisons . DENIM was further extended with the tool DAMASK ( Lin , 2003 ) , which additionally supports sketching and prototyping of cross - device user interfaces ( see Figure 3 . 3 ) . Nakakoji et al . ( 1997 ) presented a system that is closely related to The Electronic Cocktail Napkin . eMMa ( Environment for Multimedia Authoring ) is a system that supports inexperienced users in designing information artifacts such as web pages . Its knowledge - based approach supports the user by providing contextual information from an internal database . It supports creativity by helping the user to reflect upon his design in the same way as a skilled trainer would do . Eventually , Bailey et al . introduced a tool for the electronic sketching of behaviors . DEMAIS features a sketch - based visual language for depicting and simulating interactive behavior ( Bailey , Konstan , & Carlis , 2001 ; Bailey , 2002 ) . Using a storyboard editor and sketches , it can be used by interface designers for prototyping early design ideas in a fluent , yet interactive way . It hence shares similar goals as SILK , Related Research 71 DENIM and DAMASK . Today’s commercial tools such as UISketcher 10 or Paper 11 implement similar concepts for use on mobile devices such as tablets with pen and touch input . The iPad App Paper is a remarkable example , as it is consistently designed for informal and fluent use by providing a pen and gesture - based interface that entirely avoids the need for buttons and menus . Overall , the reviewed tools are good examples on how designers can be better supported in externalizing their ideas more fluently using graphical user interfaces . As will be discussed in the proceedings , these works were laying the groundwork for future tools that include physical or material interaction modalities for making externalization even more natural and fluent . Figure 3 . 3 : SILK ( left ) , DENIM ( center ) and DAMASK ( right ) . Sketch - based interfaces and spatial free - form layouts as well as Zoomable User Interfaces are considered useful for informal externalization and reflection by many researchers . Large Displays A further noteworthy area in creativity support research can be found in tools that are used on large displays such as interactive whiteboards . The first notable research in this area was introduced , and with the systems ClearBoard ( Ishii , Kobayashi , & Grudin , 1993 ) , Liveboard ( Elrod et al . , 1992 ) and Tivoli ( Thomas , 1993 ) . ClearBoard is an interactive whiteboard that integrates a shared remote workspace with an interpersonal co - located interaction space ( see Figure 3 . 4 ) . Using video feeds that are overlaid on the whiteboard drawings , multiple persons can work together on a single sketch using the same interface over remote locations . The system thereby uses a “see - through window” metaphor and digital pen input to bring together two designers in a virtual workspace , supporting face - to - face conversation , gestures and deictic references across two separate locations . The first well - developed interactive whiteboard for co - located use was Liveboard , presented by Elrod et al . ( 1992 ) . The system runs a graphical user interface called Tivoli ( Thomas , 1993 ) , which supports stroke capture and interaction concepts for organizing and managing drawings in loose structures such as containers and lists . Flatland ( Mynatt , Igarashi , Edwards , & Lamarca , 1999 ) extended the whiteboard as interface metaphor by providing advanced features such as automatic stroke segmentation for making the grouping , merging and manipulation of drawings more fluent . Flatland also added domain - specific behaviors to support to - do lists , line drawing beautification , map drawing and simple calculations based on sketches . While these tools focused on pen strokes as primary medium , Post - Brainstorm ( Guimbretière et al . , 2001 ) introduced interaction techniques for managing other kinds of information artifacts such as images and application windows on a large interactive whiteboard ( see Figure 3 . 4 ) . The pen - operated system integrates Flowmenus ( Guimbretiére & Winograd , 2000 ) and scaling techniques to simulate the feel of a real wall and for efficient manipulation and spatial organization of digital content on the whiteboard interface . Similar interface elements for efficient management of whiteboard content were also presented by Mangano and Baker ( 2008 ) with the whiteboard tool Calico . The interface provides basic sketching functionality , user - defined containers 10 http : / / www . uisketcher . com / 11 http : / / www . fiftythree . com / paper Technology in the Design Process 72 called “scraps” , a zoomable canvas and a grid view to organize a set of drawings . Support for organizing and clustering sketch - based information items on wall displays is also a focus of the ModLab ( Herrmann & Nolte , 2010 ) and the IdeaPlayground ( Perteneder et al . , 2012 ) systems ( see Figure 3 . 4 ) . Similar , however not as sophisticated functionality , is also commercially available in today’s SmartBoard 12 software and other software packages for interactive whiteboard use such as Mimio 13 or eBeam 14 . Figure 3 . 4 : Clearboard 15 ( top - left ) , Post Brainstorm ( top - right ) , ModLab ( bottom - left ) , IdeaPlayground ( bottom - right ) . Systems supporting collaborative design and reflection activities often employ large interactive displays such as interactive whiteboards . Yet , most of these approaches only support interactions by one user at a time , limiting the participation of multiple other people . One common theme in interactive whiteboarding tools – with the exception of work by Haller et al . ( 2006 , 2010 ) – is the lack of support for collaborative work by multiple people at the same time . While some systems support remote collaboration , typical whiteboard interfaces only support single - user interaction in co - located settings . However , studies have shown that whiteboard interactions – even on traditional whiteboards – are usually accompanied by natural turn - taking , which makes simultaneous interaction less important ( Venolia , Deline , & Ko , 2007 ) . As will be discussed in more detail in the following , researchers have hence considered other approaches for supporting collaboration , such as systems using multiple devices or tangible components as individual workspaces . 12 http : / / smarttech . com / smartboard 13 http : / / www . mimio . com 14 http : / / www . e - beam . com 15 http : / / web . media . mit . edu / ~ ishii / ishii - images / CB - 2 . gif Related Research 73 Multiple Displays One of the drawbacks of single user groupware ( SDG ) such as whiteboards is the lack of individual interaction spaces and the need for turn - taking ( only one user has control of the system at a time ) ( Stewart , Bederson , & Druin , 1999 ) . Accordingly , researchers have also explored the use of multiple displays for supporting both individual work and creative collaboration using synchronous groupware systems ( SGS ) . Figure 3 . 5 : CoLab ( top - left ) , EDC ( top - right ) , i - LAND ( bottom ) . Multiple displays or smart rooms are used to support co - located creative collaboration by providing both individual and collaborative interaction spaces . Smart room infrastructures combine multiple devices into one workspace . These tools often consist of several devices that are connected via networks . One of the first of such systems was Cognoter ( Stefik & Foster , 1986 ) , a software to be used in digital meeting rooms that are equipped with multiple desktop computers and large screens , such as the CoLab at Xerox PARC ( Sibley et al . , 1987 ) ( see Figure 3 . 5 ) . Cognoter allowed collaborative preparation and presentation of ideas and associated text in a distributed way . Functionality that was provided by the system included the ability to brainstorm , organize and evaluate ideas using distributed text input as well as free - form sketching . In combination with Liveboard , it also allowed transitions between individual work and tightly coupled collaboration at a shared surface . A similar system was also described by Nunamaker Technology in the Design Process 74 et al . ( 1991 ) , who presented the EMS ( Electronic Meeting Support ) system to be used for collaborative brainstorming , idea refinement and idea evaluation . It was one of the first systems that explicitly addressed social dynamics in its system design as it was designed around a particular workflow to make meetings more efficient and more productive . Through the use of anonymity and specific tasks , it was able to achieve a positive impact on idea production , especially for larger groups . While both described systems used a combination of desktop computers and large screens , the i - LAND system ( Streitz et al . , 1999 ) introduced the concept of “smart rooms” that feature a variety of input and output devices . i - LAND was specifically designed for supporting fluent creative collaboration via computing devices by integrating an interactive whiteboard ( DynaWall ) , a table ( InteracTable ) and chairs ( CommChairs ) into an interconnected infrastructure ( see Figure 3 . 5 ) . Its accompanying tools for idea finding BEACH ( Basic Environment for Active Collaboration with Hypermedia ) ( Prante , Magerkurth , & Streitz , 2002 ) provided interaction concepts for synchronous interaction , spatial organization of information items and support for face - to - face interaction modalities such as touch and pen input . Additionally , the environment provided gesture - based interaction techniques for creating visualizations such as mind - maps and graphs . i - LAND was a remarkable research project and infrastructure that was followed by many other systems that also aimed at utilizing multiple input and output devices to support creative collaboration . The EDC ( Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory ) ( Arias et al . , 2000 ) and Caretta ( Sugimoto , Hosoi , & Hashizume , 2004 ) for example integrate personal and social digital spaces by providing connected interaction spaces on an interactive table and a wall projection ( see Figure 3 . 5 ) . Situated within the application context of urban planning and transportation design , the systems provide multimodal interaction modalities such as digital pens and physical objects within a shared action space ( table ) . The EDC system however also provides a reflection space ( wall projection ) that can be used by the designers for reflecting upon the collaborative progress within design sessions . Further , the reflection display can be used by a dedicated facilitator for ad - hoc analysis of the results created by the collaborating individuals . It was hence one of the first systems to actively support reflection activities and facilitators as part of design activities . Other systems supporting collaborative design with multiple interconnected devices also focus on sketching or brainstorming activities by combining tablet PCs with large displays . Notable examples for such collaborative systems can be found in SCWID ( Supporting Creative Work In Design ) ( Cook , Metcalf , & Bailey , 2005 ) , PSPD ( Public Social Private Design ) ( Warr , 2006 ) , TEAM STORM ( Hailpern , Hinterbichler , Leppert , Cook , & Bailey , 2007 ) and GAMBIT ( Sangiorgi , Beuvens , & Vanderdonckt , 2012 ) . All of these systems support individual work with private tablet PCs while collaboration is supported via shared views on large displays . The seemingly most advanced system is TEAM STORM ( Hailpern et al . , 2007 ) , which also demonstrates an interaction model for working with multiple ideas in parallel ( see Figure 3 . 6 ) . Using a distributed workspace , sketches created on the tablet devices can be shared on a digital whiteboard . A pen - operated graphical user interface allows fluent transitions between individual work and collaborative reflection and refinement . The interface also features spatial organization tools and explicitly supports the creation of alternatives to the created design ideas , thereby stimulating both divergence and convergence . Other systems that integrate multiple displays also support brainstorming activities . BrainStorm ( Hilliges et al . , 2007 ) for example facilitates the creation and discussion of ideas by combining a pen - operated interactive table with a large wall projection ( see Figure 3 . 6 ) . Supporting dyads of designers , the system allows individual ideation and loosely - coupled sharing of post - it notes on the digital table . The pen - operated wall projection is eventually used as reflection display for clustering and annotating notes in tightly - coupled collaboration . Accordingly , notes can be transferred from the table to the wall display by the use of flipping gestures . Similarly , Tse et al . ( 2008 ) presented The Designer’s Environment for supporting Related Research 75 the KJ collaborative creativity method , which is based on individual ideation and collaborative clustering of notes . Therefore , ( Tse et al . , 2008 ) presented a tablet transfer technique and multimodal interaction techniques for creating and interacting with clusters and piles of notes on a digital table through touch , gestures and speech ( see Figure 3 . 6 ) . The design tool hence focused on providing more natural interaction modalities for informal group work . Figure 3 . 6 : GAMBIT ( top - left ) , TEAM STORM ( top - right ) , BrainStorm ( bottom - left ) , The Designer’s Environment ( bottom - right ) . Mobile devices , interactive tables and wall displays in combination with informal interaction modalities such as touch or pen input form new kind of work environments for creative work practices . Physical and Tangible Interaction The importance of informal interaction modalities is also visible in the amount of research that has focused on the use of physical and tangible interactions within the domain of design tools and creativity support systems . Many researchers have recognized the important role of material artifacts in design work and have therefore developed systems that allow incorporating physical objects or the human body into digital design tools . One popular approach for example is the use of digital cameras for merging digital and physical artifacts . Systems such as Collaborage ( Moran et al . , 1999 ) and The Designer’s Outpost ( Klemmer et al . , 2001a ) were among the first to utilize overhead image capture and projection to combine physical artifacts with digital tools . Inspired by designers’ use of informal collages of information on walls , the systems use computer vision methods to automatically record physical artifacts for digital reuse or modification . Collaborage uses visual tags ( Dataglyphs ) to identify cards that are pinned on a traditional whiteboard . Using a digital camera system , the recorded artifacts are integrated into a desktop - based graphical user interface and may also be used to trigger additional functionalities . Similar approaches using marker - based recognition for artifact integration were also demonstrated in several other systems . Recent tools like CAM ( Cooperative Artefact Memory ) ( Vyas , Technology in the Design Process 76 Nijholt , Heylen , Kröner , & Veer , 2010 ) or the Affinity Note Finder ( Harboe , Minke , & Huang , 2012 ) employ Augmented Reality ( AR ) technology , using cameras built into mobile devices and graphical overlay techniques . However , there are also vision - based systems that do not require the use of markers through a direct combination of physical artifacts with interactive displays . The Designer’s Outpost ( Klemmer et al . , 2001a ) for example supports collaborative website information design by integrating physical post - it notes with an interactive whiteboard interface ( see Klemmer et al . ( 2008 ) for an extensive discussion of the system ) . The system is able to create digital copies of these notes and also allows the user to add digital annotations with a pen , which results in hybrid diagrams of notes that can be reviewed within group sessions ( see Figure 3 . 7 ) . The system is in particular noteworthy as it demonstrated the use of vision - based technology not only as a technical solution to tangible interface design , but also as a contribution to the domain of digital creativity support systems by integrating a real workflow . Following The Designer’s Outpost , researchers have developed similar tools that utilize object recognition on other surfaces such as walls or tables . Cabinet ( Keller , Hoeben , & Helm , 2006 ) for example is a tool that allows designers to collect and organize design artifacts by capturing digital images of physical artifacts on an interactive table similar to a traditional light - table ( see Figure 3 . 7 ) . Once images are captured , the system allows the creation of free - form digital arrangements such as piles and clusters for individual reflection activities throughout the design process . More recent systems such as Pictionaire ( Hartmann , Morris , Benko , & Wilson , 2010 ) or MemTable ( Hunter , Maes , Scott , & Kaufman , 2011 ) use a similar setup to allow for collaborative brainstorming sessions or to record the histories of collaborative sessions for later analysis ( see Figure 3 . 7 ) . Figure 3 . 7 : The Designer’s Outpost ( top - left ) , Cabinet ( top - right ) , Pictionaire ( bottom - left ) , MemTable ( bottom - right ) . Using tangible artifacts as integral part of the system design allows integrating material qualities with digital functionality . These approaches seem especially useful for supporting design work with technology without sacrificing material qualities . Related Research 77 Support for the storage and retrieval of design artifacts is also a popular stream of research within physical and tangible design tools that do not use camera - based setups . Systems such as the Tech Box 16 from the company IDEO ( Kelley , 2007 ) or the Co - Wall ( Löwgren , 2007 ) enable designers to associate digital information to physical artifacts . Using retrieval features , information can be shared between different designers or groups of designers using the physical object as mediator . Other systems allowing for capture and retrieval are NOOT ( Dijk , Roest , Lugt , & Overbeeke , 2011 ) and Funky Wall ( Lucero , Aliakseyeu , & Martens , 2008 ) . While NOOT allows the ad - hoc recording of audio notes within design sessions , it also demonstrates an embodied concept for retrieval using tangible interaction artifacts . In contrast , Funky Wall features the recording and replaying of embodied presentations of mood boards . Using gesture interaction , bodily interactions with collections of images on a large wall projection are recorded for later review and analysis . Most systems within the category of capture and retrieval assume that a digital tool may provide benefits to designers by automatically recording sessions for later reflection activities – something that is poorly supported within material design practices . Figure 3 . 8 : Digital Pen & paper technology allows combining traditional paper and digital tools . The Shared Design Space ( left ) , The NiCE Discussion Room ( right ) . Another noteworthy area within physical and tangible design tools is the use of interactive or augmented paper and digital pens for supporting design work . Design tools based on the Anoto 17 digital pen & paper technology allow the integration of paper - based design artifacts into design tasks . This especially natural modality was successfully used in different research projects . Malmborg and Peterson ( 2004 ) presented an early explorative field study on the use of augmented paper in collaborative design sessions . Although the authors do not present or demonstrate a specifically built prototype or system , they show how this technology can be appropriated for the use in design sessions and that it may provide many benefits over screen - based approaches such as the ease of handling , the social acceptance of digital pen & paper and the unobtrusive ability of automatic recording and tracking of sessions . The research projects The Diamond’s Edge ( Bernstein , Robinson - Mosher , Yeh , & Klemmer , 2006 ) and the Shared Design Space ( Haller et al . , 2006 ) show how digital pen & paper can be augmented with digital functionality when used on projection - based interactive tables ( see Figure 3 . 8 ) . Using overhead projection , drawings made on paper can be transferred into digital representations and vice versa . While promising , the tools however only serve as technology demonstrators , lacking support for specific workflows or references to design practices . Eventually , Haller et al . ( 2010 ) also presented a way of integrating digital pen & paper into smart room 16 http : / / www . ideo . com / work / tech - box / 17 http : / / www . anoto . com Technology in the Design Process 78 infrastructures within the NiCE Discussion Room . In combination with a large - scale pen - operated interactive whiteboard , designers may use digital pen & paper technology as a complement for individual work , while collaborative work is facilitated via the whiteboard interface ( see Figure 3 . 8 ) . Sketches made on paper can be transferred to the whiteboard to allow for digital review and editing . Yet , the smart infrastructure does not address a specific method or form of collaboration that is directly related to design practices . High - level and abstract tools for using digital pen & paper in individual and collaborative situations are also available commercially with the software Anoto Pen Presenter or Livescribe Smart Pens 18 . It is to note here that the above described research within tangible and physical design tools is considered particularly relevant , as many discussed works also focus on bridging the gap between physical design work and digital tools in order to avoid transitions between both worlds or to make these transitions more fluent and natural . The basic assumption behind all of these approaches is that the benefits of physical material can be combined with technology for harnessing the benefits of digital tools without sacrificing crucial qualities of traditional design materials . Remote and Web - based Design Within recent years , a series of design tools has emerged that focus on supporting design work across time and place . By using web - based interfaces and networking technology , these approaches aim at improving collaboration of designers that are not located in the same physical space . Although not predominantly relevant in the context of this thesis , this research will be introduced in the following as it may also serve as source of inspiration for this work . The iDeas Design Ecology ( Lee , 2007 ) integrates multiple digital tools that can be used by teams of designers for creating a web - based repository of ideas . Tools for capturing and uploading ideas into a web - based repository are provided with mobile phones , digital cameras and the iDeas Notebook , a digital pen & paper design journal . Users may create ideas independently , collecting and sharing their results in parallel . By using metadata afforded by the augmented tools , access to the collaborative design content is improved . A desktop - based graphical user interface provides a timeline visualization and an interactive browser to make accessing design content of interest more efficient and to increase the awareness of collaborating individuals . Likewise , the concept of IdeaSpaces ( Venkataswamy , Sodhi , Abdildin , & Bailey , 2009 ) is a groupware approach , allowing designers to collaborate and share design artifacts via a whiteboard - like web interface . The prototype also provides tools for organizing and arranging these artifacts spatially . However , researchers have also presented tools that are not constrained to a browser interface . Rather , systems like Design TeamMate ( Martens , Parthesius , & Atasoy , 2010 ) , TeleBoard ( Gumienny et al . , 2009 ) and Dazzle ( Oehlberg , Simm , Jones , Agogino , & Hartmann , 2012 ) integrate into the physical work environment of design studios . Design TeamMate allows designers to retrieve content from the internet and to project it on a table surface . Using interactive tools and an attached graphics tablet , these design inspirations can be reused within standard software packages like Adobe Photoshop . The workplace setting hence merges the physical workplace of designers with remote collaboration features . TeleBoard is an interactive whiteboard system that supports remote collaboration with material artifacts like post - it notes ( see Figure 3 . 9 ) . A live camera stream of an interactive whiteboard is overlaid on a graphical user interface to facilitate awareness of remote collaborators . Additional networked tools further extend the system with mobile phones and digital pens for sending ideas to the board . Dazzle is a similar tool that combines multiple interconnected software clients on notebooks , desktop computers and wall displays for use in remote or co - located scenarios ( see Figure 3 . 9 ) . The system synchronizes a list of collected design artifacts via a local server . Designers may use the system to refer to shared artifacts within remote and co - located design 18 http : / / www . livescribe . com Related Research 79 sessions . The system also provides an image capturing function , which takes snapshots of a whiteboard on demand . Many of these functionalities are also available in state - of - the - art digital note - taking and file - sharing systems such as Evernote 19 or Dropbox 20 . Figure 3 . 9 : TeleBoard 21 ( left ) , Dazzle ( right ) . Design tools can also be designed to support both co - located and remote collaboration at the same time . Therefore , devices for collaborative use are combined with networking infrastructure and access to remote collaborators or synchronized design artifact repositories . 3 . 1 . 4 Analysis and Limitations Related research that is especially relevant to the research question will be analyzed and compared in more detail . This analysis will eventually lead to a justification of the proposed research question . From the historical development of the analyzed research , some trends and directions can be extracted . Firstly , technological progress has significantly expanded the scope of design tools : from formal to informal ; from small displays to large displays ; from single - user tools to systems for collaborative design ; from desktop - based systems to multiple displays or smart rooms ; and from entirely digital to tangible and hybrid interaction modalities . Secondly , there are certain themes that emerged as particular successful in supporting design practice with digital tools : informal interaction modalities , spatial visualizations , capture and access , and augmenting workflows instead of replacing them . The relation between these trends and themes will be briefly discussed in the following . Early research efforts in digital creativity support tools focused primarily on supporting more informal ways of interacting with computers to make user interfaces more accessible and more fluent , a key requirement within the theme of externalization . Input modalities like sketch - based interaction , pen and touch input can be considered promising approaches for realizing this goal as they are able to simulate or replicate traditional qualities such as fluency and immediacy . In most recent research , tangible input methods and material artifacts are increasingly used to support the creation and manipulation of external representations and design ideas . With the increasing availability of display space , researchers also tried to harness the potential of interactive visualizations and spatial arrangements as a tool for reflection . Using large display technologies such as interactive whiteboards and tabletop computers , researchers introduced spatial organization of design content , replicating and augmenting important characteristics of traditional design practice . Being able to spatially organize information such as design artifacts within software systems is an important property for supporting reflection activities . The benefits of digital storage and access also led to a focus on capture and retrieval techniques , which are required to make material design artifacts and processes available within computer systems for reflection purposes . Vision - based or marker - based capturing 19 http : / / evernote . com 20 http : / / www . dropbox . com 21 http : / / www . hpi . uni - potsdam . de / typo3temp / pics / eb821b6b89 . png Technology in the Design Process 80 mechanisms as well as digital pen & paper technology seem to provide lightweight and unobtrusive ways for enabling hybrid interactions with design artifacts . Only by using such mechanisms , a key benefit of computer systems – unlimited storage space and ease of retrieval – can be harnessed without adding additional workload to designers . Researchers have also increasingly tackled the limitations of software systems regarding collaborative design , moving from single - user systems to multi - user environments . For both co - located and remote settings , systems were developed to accommodate different kinds of multi - user scenarios and activities . Thereby , the use of multiple devices and smart environments that accommodate an infrastructure of input and output devices has considerable benefits over single display groupware . A combination of individual and shared workspaces especially fits the requirements regarding the control of social dynamics that may have dramatic effects on the effectiveness of multi - user and process support . Eventually , physical and bodily interaction modalities like augmented reality or tangible interfaces are increasingly applied to go well beyond informal digital - only modalities . As a result , computing functionalities can now be better integrated with traditional work environments – toward a hybrid coexistence of physical and digital tools . With these developments , researchers are now more and more approaching a state where technology is used as a complement or extension to traditional work practices rather than as a replacement . Regarding the research question posed within this thesis : “How can we design digital design tools that preserve and augment material and social practices of collaborative design activities ? ” , this is a desired state . Table 3 . 3 presents an overview of tools and systems that are considered specifically relevant to the research question posed within this thesis . These particular research projects were selected from the reviewed categories based on the following criteria : 1 ) relevance to the research question , 2 ) one or more contributions to the themes of the thesis framework , 3 ) technological innovation , and 4 ) maturity as a real - world system . Accordingly , the table also includes details on contributions or limitations regarding the four themes of the thesis framework .

Current limitations and open research issues are summarized , justifying the necessity and potential value for further research . In order to partly contribute to the research question , a design tool or system should at least address one or more issues within the thesis framework . Additionally , the existing concepts and interaction techniques may be judged according to the significance regarding the support for design practices as described within the previous chapter ( see section 2 . 2 ) . Limitations and potential for further improvements may become visible by contrasting the existing approaches with the proposed potential of embodied interaction as described in the introduction of this thesis ( see section 1 . 1 . 2 ) . Table 3 . 4 depicts a summary and juxtaposition of these characteristics and their hypothetical solutions . Table 3 . 4 : The potential of emerging technologies for supporting important characteristics of embodied design practice . Embodied Design Practice Embodied Interaction Externalization fluent , flexible and embodied interaction with physical artifacts fluent and flexible interaction with digital or hybrid artifacts : “embodied interaction” Reflection visible and tangible display of material artifacts in physical space spatial and tangible digital or hybrid design artifacts on digital screens : “spatial & tangible interaction” Collaboration shared persistent workspaces facilitate awareness and accessibility multi - user systems facilitate awareness and accessibility with digital design artifacts : “multi - display groupware” Process tools appropriate to workflows and techniques subtle design of technology as to complement or augment existing workflows : “reality - based interaction” Within externalization , the most important benefit of embodied design practices was identified as the fluency and flexibility that accompanies embodied actions with material design artifacts . These characteristics are especially important as they allow designers to effortlessly cycle between action and reflection within a conversation - like activity ( see section 2 . 2 . 1 ) . Digital tools may contribute most value to this theme by simulating or replicating such characteristics with the use of adequate technologies by still providing significant benefits over traditional practices . Most reviewed prototype design tools share this goal to some extent , yet they apply different measures to achieve it . For example , systems like i - LAND , Brain Storm , TEAM STORM , The Designer’s Environment , Dazzle and GAMBIT employ entirely digital interaction modalities that require significant changes in work practices and might be criticized for being too formal . Other systems such as the EDC , The Designer’s Outpost , The NiCE Discussion Room and Pictionaire use hybrid or mixed - media modalities that are much closer to traditional embodied design practices . Although mixed - media interaction consequently seems to provide most value , both have their advantages and disadvantages , as entirely digital modalities may allow for more powerful digital functionality , while physical and hybrid solutions require a certain tradeoff between the degrees of replication or simulation and their value as a digital tool ( see section 3 . 2 for further discussion ) . Hence , one may not definitely conclude which way is best , rather this area is of interest for further systematic investigation . The field of mixed - reality interfaces is just emerging , leaving many opportunities for further explorations . Hence , the theme of externalization can be considered far from being exhaustively explored . Regarding support for reflection , embodied design practices emphasize the value of the spatial and tangible nature of design artifacts in physical space . These characteristics enable designers to gain insight into their design process and to reason over their progress and alternatives , serving as a tool Related Research 83 for embodied visual planning and thinking . Digital design tools are traditionally weak in this area , due to the limitations in spatiality , visibility and tangibility of file systems and digital display space . By replicating or simulating some or all of the physical and spatial properties , creativity support tools can provide similar characteristics or might even be able to further extent or augment these with digital functionality . Only some of the reviewed systems support reflection activities . Indeed , only the EDC explicitly states a relation to this issue and provides a dedicated reflection display as solution – however without supporting spatial or tangible characteristics . Techniques that support spatial and haptic positioning can however be identified within the tools The Designer’s Outpost , Cabinet , Brain Storm , TEAM STORM and The Designer’s Environment . Limitations within all these tools can be identified in the type and number of artifacts that are supported as well as the support for informal interaction techniques for arrangement and spatial positioning . For example , the design of most systems only cares for a very limited amount of design artifacts . Hence , approaches such as zoomable user interfaces may eventually be applied to extend display space over the physical limits of screens . In the same way , there is a lack of tools that are specifically suited for reflection tasks , such as spatial clustering techniques or tangible tools for interacting with collections of design artifacts . Yet , integration of these promising techniques is yet to be explored . All of the above compared systems support collaboration in design to some extent . Within embodied design practices , designers utilize shared workspaces such as design studios for collaboration . These design environments have certain qualities such as the physical awareness and instant accessibility of design content that facilitate ad - hoc discussions and creative sessions . Further , the flexibility of design material can also be considered a tool that appropriates many different design methods . Hence , digital design environments strive toward similar properties by offering adequate tools designers may use within collaborative sessions . Most of the above discussed approaches utilize ecologies of devices and screens to support flexible collaboration styles and to support specific design methods . The design of such shared workspaces however is a complex endeavor , requiring a computing and networking infrastructure as well as suitable interaction modalities . Systems such as TEAM STORM , Brain Storm and The Designer’s Outpost are noticeable examples how design tools can indeed offer support for traditional creative activities . However , they also have limitations regarding the number of possible participants and support for simultaneous interactions with the system . Using multiple displays for individual and shared work often requires the use of transfer techniques , which may warm the flow of the overall design activity . Systems that effectively support face - to - face collaboration on shared artifacts within a single workspace are yet to explore . The EDC can be considered an outstanding example , as it provides a shared workspace with tangible artifacts that can indeed be used for simultaneous design work . Most systems however are only able to support collaboration by turn - taking , reducing the ability for all members of a design team to actively participate in the process . Hence , there is still potential to improve collaborative use by offering true multi - user interfaces . Today’s technical possibilities using devices such as interactive tabletops and tangible artifacts are far from being exhaustively applied . Eventually , one of the most striking differences between embodied practices and technology support is the appropriation of tools to processes and workflows . While in embodied design practice , as described in section 2 . 2 , the choice of methods leads to an appropriation of tools and vice versa , this may be different in digital practice . Digital systems are far less flexible and usually attuned to a specific design method or technique . While many researchers claim that their systems are suitable for supporting creative work in general , they make implicit assumptions about the flexibility of their systems and also about the nature and characteristics of creative work practices . Far too often these systems are driven by technological innovation rather than by domain - oriented design . These researchers rarely relate to traditional methods or established workflows as foundation to their system Technology in the Design Process 84 designs . Rather , they invent tools that bring about their own workflows . While this is also a reasonable approach , it often limits the application of established design practices as designers have to adapt their work style to what the digital tool offers . As a result , the tools frequently lack support for methodic design practices and do not respect the influence of social dynamics as described in section 2 . 1 . 6 . Tools like TEAM STORM , Brain Storm and The Designer’s Environment are outstanding exceptions . The Designer’s Environment for example is attuned to the requirements of a specific design method , namely the KJ creativity technique . However , it does not address social factors that may have an important impact on the productivity of such group activities . In contrast , Brain Storm and TEAM STORM are both informed by a deeper understanding of the work domain . The researchers also address social dynamics and indicate the influence their tools might have on the procedure of these methods . Such approaches however are rarely applied , as they require a thorough domain - driven design approach rather than a technology - driven methodology . Hence , the relation of digital tools to traditional design practices and influences on social dynamics are an important research field that is further being investigated within this thesis . To summarize , previous research has clearly contributed to some issues of the research question . However , further explorations are necessary to advance the state of the art in a holistic way , addressing each of the discussed themes not separately , but in combination . This is by no means an easy task , as it requires a firm understanding of the relations between technology and established design practices in social , material and bodily dimensions . Hence , one important goal of this thesis is to provide examples on how to approach such undertakings . Further , the thesis seeks to establish and test a design methodology that similar - minded researchers or designers can use as guidance for their design processes . 3 . 1 . 5 Summary This chapter provided a review and analysis of existing research that relates to the research question . The results are summarized as follows : Technology is an inherent part of today ' s work environments and is used in the design process as a tool for both creating and thinking . It yields many benefits such as precision , simulation , ease of reuse , storage , remote collaboration , automation , appropriation and may also enable new kinds of design methods or techniques that are not possible with traditional tools only . The integration of digital tools into embodied design practices brings about limitations such as the lack of informal ways of externalization , a rush to final designs , a lack of spatial properties , limited visibility and accessibility of artifacts and a lack of shared and individual workspaces for informal creative co - located collaboration . Further , digital tools introduce different workflows that often replace instead of complement traditional design methods . Researchers have proposed various design guidelines and requirements for designing successful creativity support systems such as : support for certain interconnected activities , avoiding interruption of fluency , use of spatial visualizations for comparing variations , capturing of histories for later reflection , hands - on manipulation with physical tools , support for different situations and modes of collaboration , and augmentation of methods instead of replacement . Research in digital design tools has brought about novel concepts that often manifest many of the previously discussed guidelines . Thereby , research efforts have primarily focused on the use of visualizations , informal externalization , large displays , multiple displays , tangible and material tools as well as web - based or remote systems . Related Research 85 An analysis revealed limitations within existing research regarding the often implicitly made tradeoffs of digital and physical interaction modalities . Further potential improvements are needed within the areas of spatial interfaces , hybrid digital tools , true multi - user support and augmentation of traditional design practices . The conclusions deducted from this review regarding the thesis framework are defined in Table 3 . 5 . Table 3 . 5 : Conceptual conclusions regarding the four themes of the thesis framework . Conceptual Conclusions Externalization A firm understanding of the relations between physical and digital interaction modalities within the domain of design tools is needed . Novel tools may support embodied actions by integrating material and digital design artifacts . Reflection Digital design environments have limited support for spatial and material reflection activities . Novel tools may better harness the dynamic characteristics of display space . Collaboration Visibility , accessibility and persistence of external representations are often limited within digital collaboration scenarios . New tools may support more fluent and informal modalities for collaboration in shared and individual workspaces . Process Many digital design tools replace existing methods or techniques instead of augmenting or extending them . New tools can provide benefits by preserving and augmenting traditional design methods at the same time . 3 . 2 Designing for Embodied Work Practices An increasing interest in the material , social and bodily aspects is not only visible in the domain of design tools and creativity support research , but also within HCI in general . Within the last decade , researchers have explored new approaches for understanding and advancing this area of research . In the following , these developments will be briefly reviewed . Further , existing theoretical foundations and frameworks that may guide the design of such technologies are discussed . One of the first researchers that made physical interfaces popular among HCI researchers were Ishii and Ullmer ( 1997 ) that described the notion of “Tangible User Interfaces” ( TUIs ) . Building upon the idea of “Graspable User Interfaces” ( Fitzmaurice , Ishii , & Buxton , 1995 ) that used physical “bricks” as direct input devices , the concept describes an approach of using physical objects as an alternative to traditional mouse and keyboard - based input mechanisms . Fitzmaurice ( 1996 ) previously demonstrated the use of multiple spatially distributed tangible objects for controlling specific functionalities within a digital system . The driving notion behind these concepts was that these haptic interfaces are able to bring some of the richness people experience when interacting with physical things into the digital design space ( Ishii & Ullmer , 1997 ) . Thereby , the authors proposed to represent digital content through tangible components which can be manipulated by physical interactions . The benefit of this is that users may literally “grasp” into the data , something that is not possible with indirect input mechanism like the mouse , where representation and control mechanisms are separated . Instead , using TUIs , representations of data are closely coupled through graphical display around or on tangible objects , often called “tokens” . The concept can hence also be understood as an extension to the “Direct Manipulation” paradigm ( Shneiderman , 1981 ) , which also exploited the user’s knowledge about the physical world . In direct manipulation interfaces however , the user navigates in and manipulates virtual space that is represented as familiar or metaphorical objects and tools . These virtual objects typically rely on metaphors such as the desktop and folders for conveying the mappings of functionality and representations to the user . Visual objects provide affordances for Designing for Embodied Work Practices 86 mouse and keyboard interaction ( e . g . pressing a button or dragging an icon ) . In contrast to these direct manipulation interfaces , TUIs do not rely on typical representations such as Windows , Icons , Menus and Pointers ( WIMP ) . Instead , the affordances for interaction are directly mapped to corresponding physical objects . For demonstrating the potential of TUIs , Ishii and Ullmer ( 1997 ) developed an example which allowed placing iconic representations of buildings onto a digital map for building a hybrid urban planning simulation . Manipulations on buildings are reflected in the digital representations , simulating effects such as wind flow or sunlight . Although this example is very specific to the application domain , researchers have developed many other tools that followed this idea ( Arias et al . , 2000 ) . Among the most cited benefits of TUIs are intuitiveness ( Ishii & Ullmer , 1997 ) , motor memory ( Klemmer et al . , 2006 ) , learnability ( Resnick et al . , 1998 ) , and awareness in collaborative use ( Hornecker & Buur , 2006 ) . Critics however frequently point out that many of these tangible tools are only useful in very specific situations and that the TUI approach hence often sacrifices flexibility for simplified use ( Antle , Corness , & Droumeva , 2009 ) . Starting from the idea of TUIs , researchers have introduced related fields of research that are also known under the umbrella term of “Post - WIMP” user interfaces . Post - WIMP describes a very wide field , including many different interface variants that deviate from the traditional desktop - based graphical user interface by providing different metaphors or physical , spatial and bodily interaction modalities ( Dam , 1997 ) . Frameworks such as Instrumental Interaction ( Beaudouin - Lafon , 2000 ) build upon the Direct Manipulation paradigm for conceptualizing and generalizing novel metaphors ( e . g . ZUIs ) and interaction techniques ( e . g . Toolglasses , Graspable Interfaces ) as extensions to WIMP interfaces . In contrast , more recent frameworks do not consider tangible or spatial concepts as extension to existing interfaces but rather as an entirely new domain that does not necessarily have links to WIMP . Among these are fields such as Physical Computing ( popular among Design communities ) , Physical - Digital Appliances ( popular within Product Design ) , Interactive Spaces ( often referring to spatial , multi - device installations ) and Tangible Augmented Reality ( tangible input to Augmented Reality systems ) ( Hornecker & Buur , 2006 ) . Other , wider related areas are Whole - Body Interaction ( body as input device ) , Gestural Interfaces ( body or arm movements as input device ) , Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces ( interactive displays such as tables and walls that feature either touch and tangible input , or both ) , Ambient Technology ( systems integrated with the physical environment ) , Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing ( distributed and always available interfaces ) , Spatial Interfaces ( emphasize spatial navigation such as ZUIs ) and Organic Interfaces ( shape - changing or dynamic haptic interfaces ) . All these approaches have in common that they embrace one or more of the following design principles : tangibility and materiality , physical embodiment of data , bodily interaction and embeddedness in real spaces and contexts ( Hornecker & Buur , 2006 ) . Further terms such as Embodied Interaction ( Dourish , 2004 ) , Tangible Interaction ( Hornecker & Buur , 2006 ) , Reality - based Interaction ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) , Natural User Interfaces ( Hofmeester & Wigdor , 2009 ) , and Blended Interaction ( Jetter , Geyer , Schwarz , & Reiterer , 2012 ; Jetter , Reiterer , & Geyer , 2013 ) seek to unify these “next generation” interfaces under a common theoretical theme and also present perspectives and visions for understanding this area of research . Due to the large number of similar terms and definitions and for the sake of readability and consistency , this thesis uses to the widespread term Embodied Interaction when referring to these approaches . In the following , existing theoretical frameworks and design approaches that contribute to understanding the relation between digital and physical interactions are reviewed and discussed . 3 . 2 . 1 Design Approaches Researchers have proposed numerous frameworks and theories on how to understand and analyze embodied or tangible interactions . A literature review by Mazalek and Hoven ( 2009 ) suggests that the field is very dynamic and increasingly expanding . The authors present an overview of the research area , citing over 22 different frameworks and theoretical perspectives . The following review however Related Research 87 only regards the seemingly most valuable frameworks regarding the research at hand with a focus on useful design recommendations or guidelines and in particular recommendations for integrating digital , physical and social practices . With his approach Embodied Interaction , Dourish ( 2004 ) proposed a theoretical foundation to HCI that emphasizes an understanding in phenomenology and practical as well as social actions instead of cognitivist models . Thereby the author ties together the areas of tangible user interfaces , social computing and the concept of affordances to provide a new understanding of human - computer interaction . The philosophical tradition of phenomenology considers that “meaning arises through interaction with the world” rather than through internal thought processes as argued by the Cartesian philosophy that separates mind and body ( Dourish , 2004 ) . The notion of meaning thereby highlights that “the information in the system makes sense only in the context of a set of common practices by which people can select , interpret , understand , and put the information to use in the course of their work . ” ( Dourish , 2004 , p . 134 ) . Embodied Interaction hence argues that previous approaches in HCI that were based on the Cartesian philosophy are insufficient for understanding and analyzing phenomena like tangible and collaborative interaction as they do not care for bodily and social context . Instead , Dourish claims for observing and modeling users in their physical and social environment to derive design requirements and to discover suitable affordances . Similar to previous approaches such as Contextual Design ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) , he emphasizes the importance specific situated practices have for designing computer support . Due to the various details different work situations yield , he does not propose general guidelines and rules for the design of such systems . Rather he proposes following design principles : 1 ) computation is a medium , 2 ) meaning arises on multiple levels , 3 ) users , not designers , create and communicate meaning , 4 ) users , not designers manage coupling , 5 ) embodied technologies participate in the worlds they represent , and 6 ) embodied interaction turns action into meaning ( Dourish , 2004 , p . 162ff ) . Computation is a medium postulates that computation rather than computers are to be understood as a medium – a tool for communicating or transmitting meaning to the user . This meaning arises on multiple levels , because artifacts , representations and metaphors of computational systems are always open to multiple forms of use . The creation and communication of meaning as well as the intentional connection that arises in the course of interaction called coupling , are not entirely within the responsibility of the designer . Rather , how technology is eventually being used as an aspect of work practice cannot be predetermined , but arises as a response to the immediate , situated activity . Further , Dourish argues that embodied technologies are part of the world they represent , which means that just like the mind cannot be separated from the body , technology cannot be separated from the world . Hence , embodiment means that new technologies are also an inherent part of the situation . Eventually , and probably most importantly , Embodied Interaction proposes that actions turn systems and contexts into meaning , which means that meaning cannot be represented with artifacts or systems only , but through situated use . With these design principles , Dourish ( 2004 ) provides thought - provoking and inspiring ideas on how the relation between digital systems and embodied practices unfolds . As largely independent from specific technologies and developments , they are very robust in themselves and present a valuable starting point for researchers . Yet , as the scholar admits , “they suggest directions but do not provide hard - and - fast recipes” ( Dourish , 2004 , p . 188 ) . Antle ( 2009 ) adds that the proposed design principles also lack empirical evidence and are mostly based on reflections or episodic examples . As a contribution to the goal of this thesis , the design principles however postulate the need for intensive observation and analysis of existing situated practices as a starting point for the design of creativity support systems . Further , the design principles advise that the “meaning” the eventually developed design tools unfold can only be seen within situated use , which calls for user studies within a realistic social context . Designing for Embodied Work Practices 88 Hornecker ( 2004 ) presented a framework for understanding and designing tangible user interfaces and in particular for supporting collaborative use . The framework , which is based on reviews of theories of computer supported cooperative work ( CSCW ) and a series of empirical studies , is structured around four themes : 1 ) Tangible Manipulation , 2 ) Spatial Interaction , 3 ) Embodied Facilitation , and 4 ) Expressive Representation . Tangible Manipulation refers to the goal to harness the capabilities of the human body and perception , such as bodily interaction with physical objects . As such interactions are visible and legible , they also support implicit communication and peripheral awareness in group situations ( e . g . deictic references ) ( Hornecker , 2004 ) . With Spatial Interaction , the researcher addresses the body as reference point within physical space and recommends that tangible user interfaces may exploit the qualities space offers for supporting their psychological meanings . In Embodied Facilitation , Hornecker argues that physical structure that is imposed by tangible interfaces is very powerful as it is able to enforce social structure and hence can be used for facilitation and for educating users . Eventually , Expressive Representation emphasizes the fact that hybrid elements communicate to users and hence their representations must convey the desired meaning to the user . In order to “read” these representations , common ground is needed . Regarding the research at hand , the theme Embodied Facilitation is of special interest as it refers to the benefits tangible interface components may have for stimulating collaboration . Hornecker ( 2005 ) presents a more detailed discussion of this theme by discussing three design concepts that can be used to facilitate knowledge with the use of tangible interactions : 1 ) Embodied Constraints , 2 ) Multiple Access Points , and 3 ) Tailored Representation . Embodied Constraints are components of an interface that restrict what people can do and thereby steer the behavior of users . Using subtle mechanisms such as a particular system setup , space configurations or objects , the system may encourage actors in following a path that is beneficial for collaboration , such as to distribute a task , to help each other out , or to coordinate action ( Hornecker , 2005 ) . Multiple Access Points are the options collaborating individuals have for interacting with the system . Restricting access has implications on group dynamics , such as users not being able to participate in a process which leads to facilitator style interactions and turn - taking . On the other hand , non - privileged simultaneous access makes it difficult for individuals to take over control of the system . Hornecker’s guidelines recommend providing multiple points for interaction , to allow for simultaneous interactions and to give equal access to everyone because simultaneous interactions are important to facilitate shared understanding and distributed ownership . Eventually , the concept of Tailored Representations refers to the representations the system offers for novice and expert users . These often visual or haptic elements have to conform to the user’s expectations within the domain , the task and the user group . Hence , Hornecker recommends building upon the experiences of the group and its members , to make interaction intuitive for novel users , and to allow the semantics to rely on specific knowledge . The design recommendations by Hornecker ( 2004 , 2005 ) are especially useful for recognizing the value tangible user interfaces have for supporting collaborative work . Yet , they are entirely based on own reflections and analyses of a limited set of empirical results . The framework should thus be read as proposal and needs further grounding through studies that systematically explore the themes ( Hornecker , 2005 ) . Further , the design guidelines refer to tangible interaction in general and hence have to be re - evaluated within different application domains and communities . Comparable to the work by Dourish ( 2004 ) , Klemmer et al . ( 2006 ) derive an understanding of embodiment from the fields of psychology , sociology and philosophy . Based on theories of cognitive science and reflective practice , the authors present a discussion of five themes that are relevant to the design of tangible interactive systems : 1 ) thinking through doing , 2 ) performance , 3 ) visibility , 4 ) risk , and 5 ) thickness of practice . With these themes , the authors do not only provide a framework for understanding embodied interactions , but also derive recommendations for the design of digital tools . Related Research 89 In thinking through doing , the authors emphasize the importance of physical action as an active component of human cognition . Interactive systems should therefore facilitate cognitive development ( learning ) through physical interactions . Further , digital systems should support gestures , because they are an important and natural part of how humans think and communicate . Systems should also maintain epistemic actions , such as the manipulation of artifacts not for the purpose of creation but to better understand and offload cognitive work . By applying these principles , interactive systems are able to support the user not only in creation , but also in reflection . For backing up their clams , Klemmer et al . ( 2006 ) explicitly refer to reflective practice as described by Schön ( 1983 ) and also to findings from design practice . Within their theme performance , the authors further argue that bodily skills such as hand motion s and motor memory play an important role in expert behavior , which means that trained individuals possess tacit knowledge and are hence very skilled in rapidly translating rich sensory information to bodily actions . Systems should support such mastery by not limiting the user in these actions - centered skills through inadequate interaction modalities . Yet , the authors also discuss the importance of visibility for situated learning and collaboration . Systems should provide visible and accessible artifacts to improve awareness and ad - hoc access to information . Examples for this theme also include the use of paper collages on design studio walls that are tools for inspiration ( learning ) as well as coordination . Within the theme risk , the authors note that physical actions are always bound to a specific uncertainty or erroneous use due to their irreversibility . Hence embodied interaction techniques should be designed in awareness of the fact that users need to have trust in the effects they might have . Eventually , the authors also address the relation between established thick practices and their digital counterparts and argue for careful design approaches that do not replace beneficial properties of the physical world in turn for functionality : “…we argue that because there is so much benefit in the physical world , we should take great care before unreflectively replacing it . More precisely , from a design perspective , solutions that carefully integrate the physical and digital worlds — leaving the physical world alone to the extent possible — are likely to be more successful by admitting the improvisations of practice that the physical world offers” ( Klemmer et al . , 2006 ) . The themes presented by Klemmer et al . ( 2006 ) are important for understanding the benefits tangible and embodied interfaces yield . These arguments are valuable for creating new design claims or for thinking about a more general design direction when planning novel interfaces . However , in particular the theme thick practice is reflected within the primary research question of this thesis and hence is of great value for backing up the importance of integrating digital tools into material practices . Yet , the authors do not include empirical facts or practical recommendations on how designers should actually balance digital and physical components . From a different perspective , Jacob et al . ( 2007 ) presented a similar approach to Klemmer et al . ’s theme of thick practice . In their framework Reality - based Interaction ( RBI ) , the authors present concepts for analyzing embodied interaction and Post - WIMP interfaces based on an understanding of “reality” . Regarding the relation of digital tools to embodied practices , they postulate that “new interaction styles draw strength by building on uses’ pre - existent knowledge of the everyday , non - computer world to a much greater extent than before . [ … ] that is , interaction becoming more like the real world” ( Jacob et al . , 2007 , p . 3 ) . The researchers propose that seeing novel interaction styles through this lens may provide insights for designers and researchers for both designing and evaluating these emerging interfaces . RBI is hence related to Direct Manipulation in the sense that it strives for increased realism of the interface for a more direct interaction ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) . However , Jacob et al . ( 2007 ) also note that merely making an interface as reality - based as possible is not a fruitful way to harness the power of computing . Rather , a thoughtful tradeoff between mimicking the real world and unrealistic or artificial features is necessary . They exemplify their approach by introducing the concept of the “Power vs . Reality tradeoff” ( see Figure 3 . 10 ) . Designing for Embodied Work Practices 90 Figure 3 . 10 : Power vs . reality tradeoff diagram ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) . “Power” thereby is a generalization of the functionality and efficiency that is typically provided by computer systems . In embodied interaction , the degree of power is often balanced against properties of reality that are considered intuitive and realistic . According to the authors , designers are able to create better user interfaces when following the goal “to give up reality only explicitly and only in return for increasing power” ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) . Within this scheme , interfaces are considered better when they provide power and realism at the same time . Post - WIMP interfaces and interaction techniques can be classified and compared within this tradeoff . In Figure 3 . 10 , “A” represents an interface variant . If a redesign increases the power of the interface , it typically moves to the upper left quadrant , as an increase in power often sacrifices power . The opposite tradeoff would increase the realism of the interface but would also decrease power ( bottom right quadrant ) . RBI theory claims that designers should strive for moving interface variants to the top right quadrant to gain both power and realism – something that is quite hard to achieve . The opposite ( grey area , bottom left quadrant ) is to be avoided at all costs , as both power and realism would decrease . Later , Jacob et al . ( 2008 ) more specifically referred to relevant aspects of the “real world” by adding four themes of reality which are also used to make tradeoffs more concrete . They structure reality according to skills of humans that are related to their physical and social environment : 1 ) Naïve Physics , 2 ) Body Awareness and Skills , 3 ) Environment Awareness and Skills , and 4 ) Social Awareness and Skills . Naïve Physics means the common sense humans have in knowledge about the physical world , like gravity , friction , velocity and persistence or scale . These aspects may be simulated within tangible interfaces to make them more intuitive and fluent . Body Awareness and Skills refers to the perception of humans of their own bodies and their ability to control and coordinate it . Input techniques such as gestural interfaces and whole body interaction are for example able to harness these skills . Environment Awareness and Skills addresses the sense people have of their surroundings , including spatial orientation , navigation and manipulation of objects in space . Emerging interaction styles such as TUIs or ZUIs can be used to simulate such physical characteristics . Eventually , the fourth theme Social Awareness and Skills means that people are generally aware of others that are within their immediate environment and have certain skills for interacting with them . Digital systems may support such interactions by including awareness mechanisms and collaboration styles with adequate interaction techniques that are suitable for both verbal and non - verbal communication ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) . The authors also defined different aspects of “power” that may be weighed against the simulation of realism . Accordingly , the authors propose a series of “desired qualities” that define the benefits digital technology yield when compared to physical practices : 1 ) Expressive Power , 2 ) Efficiency , 3 ) Related Research 91 Versatility , 4 ) Ergonomics , 5 ) Accessibility , and 6 ) Practicability . Expressive Power refers to the degree of functionality a digital system provides . Simulating reality often limits functionality , hence conflicting with the support for a variety of functionalities . Digital systems also usually allow tasks to be performed more efficient compared to traditional practices . Hence , the Efficiency a system offers needs to be balanced against other qualities of the real world . Similarly , Versatility refers to the ability of digital systems in performing a range of tasks rather than just one particular activity . Increasing realism in the interface also limits the degree of versatility , as tangible interactions are typically attuned to particular tasks . Some physical interfaces may also impose physical fatigue on the user when compared to entirely digital modalities . Thus , it is important to consider the Ergonomics of new interaction techniques . Eventually , Accessibility and Practicability refer to the pragmatics , as limited availability or technological constraints may inhibit users from using tangible interfaces . As Figure 3 . 11 depicts , the properties of reality and power potentially provide a very large space for tradeoffs . Figure 3 . 11 : Characteristics of Reality and Power may be traded against each other ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) . Jacob’s RBI framework closely addresses the relation between physical practices and digital tools and may potentially be used as a foundation to a design process . The authors however do provide the framework as a tool for classifying and comparing systems that employ embodied interactions , rather than as a design method that can be readily applied to a given design problem . As the authors admit , their concept also has certain limitations . For example , the term reality is problematic in itself as it is dependent on the social and cultural context ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) . Additionally , reality in Jacob et al . ’s sense refers primarily to a physical , non - digital world . Yet much of today’s reality is already digital , such as mice and keyboards that are arguably considered to be “real” for many people . The authors respect this , clarifying that reality is a vague concept that is in no case strictly specified . In contrast , it is highly dependent on the context . In this light , the framework may provide valuable advice and design principles that may be applied to the first research objective within this thesis – under the premise that “reality” is to be further defined within the application domain . In a very similar fashion as Jacob et al . ( 2007 ) , Hurtienne et al . ( 2008 ) presented an approach to designing tangible user interfaces based on Image Schemas as theoretical meta - language . Image schemas can be understood as embodied patterns of human perceptions , movements and bodily experiences ( Imaz & Benyon , 2007 ) . A collection of image schemas such as the “source path schema” , the “container schema” or the “link schema” thereby provides a set of metaphors designers may use and combine in the TUI design process . These metaphors represent the “very basic building blocks” for giving meaning to features of a digital system that is situated in the world ( Hurtienne et al . , 2008 ) . Their design methodology also includes a systematic way of assigning digital functionality to physical user interface elements . PIBA - DIBA lists ( Physicality Is Better At – Digitality Is Better At ) are proposed as a methodology to suggest which parts of an envisioned interface are to be implemented digitally or physically . This approach has also been popular within the 1950s , when MABA - MABA lists ( Machines Are Better At – Men Are Better At ) were used by ergonomists as a basis for designing machinery ( Hurtienne et al . , 2008 ) . Based on previous work ( Gjerlufsen & Olsen , 2007 ) , the basic qualities of digital and physical world are contrasted and assigned to the application domain . Table 3 . 6 depicts the basic qualities of physicality and digitality . Designing for Embodied Work Practices 92 Table 3 . 6 : Basic qualities of digital and physical worlds ( Gjerlufsen & Olsen , 2007 ) . Physicality Digitality Physical Matter Spatial Extent Spatial Position Spatial Locality State Exitance Binary Substance Non - Void Extent Ubiquitous Referential Locality State - One of the basic differences is for example the contrast between physical matter and digital substance . Matter is the “language” of the physical world which yields benefits such as : ease of manipulation of mechanical properties such as shape , ease of accessibility , instant feedback , and uniqueness ( Gjerlufsen & Olsen , 2007 ) . On the other hand , binary substance has the benefits of : ease of visual manipulation , ease of automatic processing , possibility of multiple representations ( copies ) , and ease of storage . While Gjerlufsen and Olsen ( 2007 ) did not refer to TUIs in particular , Hurtienne et al . ( 2008 ) extended their framework by adding concrete examples from a TUI vs . GUI perspective . In their design process , an analysis of the context of use is initially conducted to identify and extract image schemas from a work domain . Thereafter , specific design requirements are derived and formulated by selecting and assigning PIBA and DIBA characteristics to system functionalities . As a result , the hybrid system is supposed to have a desired combination of digital and physical components that together form new qualities . Both , Hurtienne ( 2008 ) and Gjerlufsen and Olsen ( 2007 ) provide frameworks that focus on tradeoffs as also proposed by Jacob et al . ( 2007 ) . Yet , they do not only use these tradeoffs as a tool for categorization and analysis but as a design methodology that may be used within design processes . Consequently , they indicate that tradeoffs between digital and physical qualities may also be used as a foundation to design requirements , and hence may be considered as a foundation to the first research objective within this thesis . However , both approaches do not suggest which properties are important within a particular application domain – something that still remains a major responsibility of the designer ( Israel , Hurtienne , & Weber , 2012 ) . Besides the discussed work of Hurtienne ( 2008 ) , the use of image schemas and metaphors in the design of tangible interfaces is also of great interest to many other researchers . The premise of metaphor theory is that in language and thought , metaphors help humans in understanding a concept in terms of another . This “transfer” of knowledge between two different domains may also be used for bridging the digital - physical divide . Lakoff and Johnson ( 1980 ) describe three different forms of metaphors : conceptual metaphors , embodied metaphors , and ontological metaphors . Conceptual metaphors describe that humans do not only use metaphors as a way of expressing their thoughts in language , but also as internal tools of thought that arise unconsciously from natural interactions with the environment . Embodied metaphors extend these through a transfer of knowledge from embodied schemata to an abstract concept , such as associations like “up is more” and “sad is down” ( Lakoff & Johnson , 1980 ) . An ontological metaphor in contrast represents an abstract concept as something real and physical such as an object , for example associations like “sad is heavy” . Just like the use of metaphors in the design of graphical user interfaces ( Desktop metaphor ) , these concepts are sought to be useful as design aids when considering tangible interface components . Fishkin ( 2004 ) presented a taxonomy for classifying tangible user interfaces based on the concepts of embeddedness and metaphor . The work describes how metaphors contribute to the understanding of technology that is embedded into objects . Similarly , Hurtienne ( 2009 ) presented a taxonomy for analyzing TUIs based Related Research 93 on their metaphorical extensions and image schemas . Blackwell ( 2006 ) suggested the use of diagrams as visual tools for understanding and mapping physical interface elements to abstract metaphorical concepts . Yet , these approaches are entirely analytic and descriptive as they do not advice on the selection of metaphorical elements ( Antle et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , Imaz and Benyon ( 2007 ) proposed the use of image schemas as conceptual blends for the design of user interfaces . Conceptual blends are similar to metaphors , however instead of a cross - domain mapping within two conceptual spaces , blends operate between two input spaces , receiving partial structure from both spaces to create a new space that has a structure of its own ( see Figure 3 . 12 ) . For a more detailed discussion of the differences between metaphors and blends , see Imaz and Benyon ( 2007 , p . 48ff ) . According to Imaz and Benyon ( 2007 ) , blends can be used as a design tool in both analysis and design activities . For example , within analysis , observations of real work practices can be used to detect input spaces of a particular domain ( e . g . document work is reflected in a mapping of the desktop - input space 1 - and the file system - input space 2 ) . For each input space , structures and frames may be extracted , creating rich descriptions of both spaces . These descriptions are then sources for the detection of individual elements that will be projected to the resulting conceptual integration called blend . A resulting blend ( e . g . desktop interface ) possesses characteristics of both spaces , yet it is a space of its own , characterized with emerging features that are not available in the input spaces ( e . g . copy documents ) . After analysis , the created blends can be used as a foundation to design . Visual elements of the input spaces are therefore combined in a way that makes “unpacking” the blend – recognizing features based on signs – easier for the user . The translation of blends to visual objects however is within the responsibility of the designer . While Imaz and Benyon ( 2007 ) refer to classical graphical user interfaces , the Blended Interaction approach ( Jetter , Geyer , et al . , 2012 ; Jetter et al . , 2013 ) considers four domains of design in which blending operations can be practiced : Individual Interaction , Social Interaction , Workflow , and Physical Environment . The framework thereby aims at a holistic understanding of Interactive Spaces , including tangible and social interactions . As an extension to the RBI approach , blends assist designers in finding good analogies or tradeoffs between digital and physical work practices ( Jetter , Geyer , et al . , 2012 ; Jetter et al . , 2013 ) . As blends can be hierarchically structured , they are also suitable to include established digital technologies that are in themselves blends – hence recognizing technology as a part of the real world . Figure 3 . 12 : Conceptual blending is an operation between two input spaces . Partial structure from both input spaces create a new space called blend that has emerging features of its own ( Imaz & Benyon , 2007 ) . Approaches that are based on image schemas , metaphors or blends provide guidance for the coupling between digital and physical characteristics based on embodied human experiences . Nevertheless , these approaches do depend very much on the designer’s ability of finding good analogies that the user will eventually be able to understand . This however is by no means a straightforward process , as Designing for Embodied Work Practices 94 the design of metaphorical interactions also yields dangers such as the possibility of users misinterpreting digital features because of inconsistent metaphor representations ( Blackwell , 2006 ) . The use of metaphors may also conflict with skeuomorphisms – entirely stylistic and often superficial uses of real - world elements such as old - fashioned leather and steel – that do not care for their potential metaphorical interpretations . Yet , the emerging concept of blends gives much more freedom to the design of metaphorical interfaces . Wider related approaches also focus on the notion of affordances in relation to tangible and embodied interactions . Affordances are understood as properties of the relation between an actor ( user ) and a physical artifact in the world ( object ) that reflects possible actions on those artifacts ( Gibson , 1986 ) . While Gibson did not discuss affordances in relation to the digital realm , Norman ( 1988 ) distinguished between real affordances and perceived affordances , the latter being the affordances a digital system conveys to the user through its visual cues ( e . g . pseudo three - dimensional buttons suggest that they can be pressed ) . Similar to metaphors , perceived affordances rely on cultural conventions and experiences users have learned as a part of a specific culture or domain . Hence , they are often considered useful if the intended user audience is compatible with the designer’s cultural background . Otherwise , interference with the user’s mental model can lead to confusion . Tangible interfaces that combine physical and digital elements can make use of both real affordances and perceived affordances as they are hybrid representations between these two worlds . Terrenghi ( 2007 ) discussed the different affordances digital and physical artifacts produce and examined the effects on communication , organization and collaboration . The author suggests that a simulation or replication of physical affordances in digital interfaces is not always successful as it is often technically not possible to entirely mimic physical representations . Affordances are often very subtle and slight differences in representation can lead to confusion by the user . Rather , the researchers suggest that designers should balance uniquely digital affordances with physical or hybrid replication for better harnessing the benefits of computational media : “we have to recognize what those physical affordances achieve for people when working with tangible objects , and ask how we can employ perhaps different methods to attain those same ends digitally . ” ( Terrenghi , Kirk , Sellen , & Izadi , 2007 , p . 1165 ) . Hornecker ( 2012 ) adds another problematic point by stating that “physical objects have a potentially unlimited set of properties and affordances [ . . ] the properties of digital objects need to be explicitly created [ … ] it seems almost impossible to anticipate which physical object properties users will find remarkable and react to . ” ( Hornecker , 2012 , p . 178 ) . Hence , the tension between real and perceived affordances is a great challenge for designers and calls for careful investigation . Researchers also refer to the concept of affordances to prescribe “naturalness” to digital interfaces – meaning the use of seemingly real - life interaction modalities such as touch , gesture and speech . The notion of Natural User Interfaces ( NUIs ) describes a design philosophy that however does not aim at mimicry of the real world : “Quite the opposite . We see natural as referring to the many ways users interact with and feel about the product , or more precisely , what they do and how they feel while they are using it . ” ( Wigdor & Wixon , 2011 , p . 9 ) . “Users feel the most like a natural [ sic ] with your software when they have affordances to lead them and feedback to guide them” ( Wigdor & Wixon , 2011 , p . 70 ) . Hence , the researchers argue that the design of perceived affordances is the key to a natural experience . In their book “Brave NUI World” , the authors discuss a variety of concrete and very specific guidelines and design recommendations that are grounded in the concept of perceived affordances . Yet , the guidelines focus primarily on digital modalities such as touch and gesture rather than tangible interaction . Nevertheless , the term natural in itself is very controversial and is critiqued frequently for not caring for the fact that digital artifacts are not as predictable as “natural” artifacts because they follow entirely artificial laws ( Hornecker , 2012 ) . Norman ( 2010 ) even argues that “natural user interfaces are not natural” as naturalness is only to be developed through time and familiarization . Related Research 95 The concept of affordances is not only important in the design of graphical user interfaces , but especially in the design of tangible and hybrid interactions . For getting the best out of tangible interactions , tradeoffs have to be made between replicating or imitating physical properties and the use of digital characteristics . Designers need to be conscious about what kinds of affordances are yielded by the physical , digital or hybrid representations and how users will react to them . This however is highly dependent on the background of users and their cultural norms or community practices . Hence , in the context of this thesis , designers should care about how affordances shape collaborative design practices . The previous discussion of theoretical foundations and frameworks has revealed that the design of embodied interactions is a complex issue due to the seemingly very large design space between physical and digital realms and the lack of concrete design guidelines and recommendations for designers in this emerging field ( Antle et al . , 2009 ) . As discussed , many frameworks were designed for understanding this new design domain and for analyzing different approaches rather than as a tool or methodology for use in design processes . High - level guidelines or principles such as those proposed by Dourish ( 2004 ) , Hornecker ( 2004 ) and Klemmer et al . ( 2006 ) are inspirational for understanding the benefits of embodied interactions and can be used for deriving general directions for the design of tangible computer systems . Yet , they do not provide methodological foundations as required for addressing the first research objective of this thesis . In contrast , concepts such as RBI ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) , PIBA - DIBA ( Hurtienne et al . , 2008 ) , metaphors , blends and affordances are much more concrete and generative as it was also shown that they can indeed be used as foundations to design processes ( Hurtienne et al . , 2008 ) . One common theme that can be identified within these approaches is the notion of tradeoffs – trading a quality of the “real” and physical world against desired qualities of the digital world to benefit from digital technology without sacrificing embodied experiences . This methodology is thought to bring structure into the design of embodied interactions as they allow reflections to be made on design decisions ( c . f . Jabob et al . ’s Power vs . Realty tradeoff ) . However , within all tradeoff - based approaches , the designer is responsible for identifying and describing both , the crucial properties of the application domain and the potential benefits that are yielded by technology . To summarize , the review has put forward following requirements on a design methodology : REQ1 : The methodology needs to be grounded in a firm understanding of the application domain ( Dourish , 2004 ; Hornecker , 2005 ; Hurtienne et al . , 2008 ; Jacob et al . , 2008 ; Klemmer et al . , 2006 ) . This can be achieved by conducting observational studies of design practices . REQ2 : The design of tangible interface components benefit from a systematic assignment of digital and physical properties , affordances or metaphors ( Gjerlufsen & Olsen , 2007 ; Hurtienne et al . , 2008 ; Jacob et al . , 2007 , 2008 ; Jetter , Geyer , et al . , 2012 ; Terrenghi , 2007 ) . REQ3 : The true value of embodied interactions can only be observed within situated use ( Dourish , 2004 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 Custom Design Methodology In the following , an approach is formulated in order to address RO1 : ”Devise a design methodology that systematically addresses the proposed research goal of integrating digital functionality with material design practices” . Therefore , the previously identified requirements on design methodology are applied to the application domain of design practice and creativity support . Designing for Embodied Work Practices 96 In the sense of RBI ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) , the application domain can be understood as constituting the “reality” : conventions , traditions and practices that the domain of collaborative design is grounded in . Designers have certain established work practices and environments that support their activities . They are further accustomed to particular qualities and tools that assist them in externalizing and reflecting on their design ideas . Hybrid digital tools may hence strive toward preserving or augmenting some of these features to care for intuitiveness and integration . Section 2 . 2 describes these characteristics along the thesis framework and emphasizes important features such as the use of physical artifacts , spatial arrangements and individual and collaborative spaces . These properties also contribute to an understanding of the application domain in general . However , due to the scope of the analysis conducted in section 2 . 2 , further investigations are necessary to understand the relation of embodied practices to particular situations within the design process , such as specific design methods and techniques that are eventually being supported by a digital tool . As a first step within a design process , it is hence proposed to conduct a detailed analysis how the themes of the thesis framework manifest in specific situations ( Analysis ) . This allows for identifying crucial benefits and limitations of specific embodied design practices ( REQ1 ) . Similarly , the analysis conducted within section 3 . 1 . 4 revealed the potential “power” digital tools yield for improving aspects such as productivity , efficiency , storage , awareness and accessibility . It also discussed potentially adequate interaction modalities and improvements to be made to the design of digital design tools . Within the design of creativity support systems , these technological concepts may be used to derive explicit tradeoff decisions on what kind of properties from embodied practice are worth preserving and which characteristics may be augmented or improved by designing new interaction techniques . These decisions are then to be used for design , guiding the researcher in selecting promising concepts that address particular limitations ( Design ) . Hence , a tradeoff - driven design methodology seems adequate to approach the design of such hybrid tools in a structured way ( REQ2 ) . Eventually , once a solution is developed , the designer needs to investigate the usefulness of the concepts through some form of testing . This includes the effects that the system design and particular interaction techniques yield on the workflow of the method . As embodied interactions expose their true value only through situated use , observations of tool use should be used to re - evaluate design tradeoff decisions ( REQ3 ) ( Evaluation ) . Figure 3 . 13 depicts a model of this process that is used for approaching the design and evaluation of embodied interaction concepts within the proceedings of this thesis . Figure 3 . 13 : Tradeoff - driven design methodology to be followed within the case studies . A crucial characteristic of this process is the use of explicit tradeoffs throughout the design process . Within analysis , this may be done by finding important affordances of design material , by identifying metaphors or blends that manifest within embodied practices , or by describing themes of reality as proposed by ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) . During design , these conceptual tools provide guidance on how to compose parts of a tool or system into a whole comprehensible unit that facilitates benefits over traditional work practices . Similarly , during evaluation these aspects focus the attention of the designer analysis identification of benefits and limitations of traditional practice through observations design systematic assignment of technologytradeoff decisions evaluation re - evaluation of tradeoff decisions by observing situated tool use Related Research 97 on particular parts of the tool or the supported work process for exploring the effects that are being achieved with the design . In the proceedings of this thesis , the concept of “Reality vs . Power” tradeoffs ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) as described earlier ( see section 3 . 2 . 1 ) will be used for conceptualizing these tradeoffs as it is considered especially suited for the application domain at hand . In the following , this will be exemplified by describing this tradeoff - driven process in more detail . Applying the notion of reality to the application domain means that the features that characterize traditions , norms and community standards within embodied design practice are to be formulated and described . Within this thesis , this is done using the four themes of the thesis framework as an equivalent to Jacob et al . ’s ( 2008 ) four themes of reality . As discussed in the following , they however share many aspects . For example , the theme of Naïve Physics ( NP ) resonates with the thesis theme of Externalization as many characteristics are shared , like the need for fluent bodily interactions and the importance of physicality . Likewise , the theme of Reflection can also be understood as a specialization of Jacob et al . ’s ( 2008 ) ’s theme Environment Awareness and Skills ( EAS ) and Body Awareness and Skills ( BAS ) as both refer to visibility , spatial navigation and bodily navigation that are important qualities of design environments . The theme of Collaboration can be mapped to the theme Social Awareness and Skills ( SAS ) , as both are characterized by particular social norms and dynamics as well as awareness mechanisms that facilitate effective collaboration . Eventually , the theme Process can be considered an extension to the RBI themes , as there is no such equivalent within Jacob et al . ’s themes . Within each of the themes , an analysis is being conducted to derive more precise knowledge about the embodiment of themes in particular situations . As a starting point , the previously discussed abstract limitations and benefits of embodied and digital design practices ( see Table 3 . 1 ) can guide such investigations . Just like the notion of reality can be transferred to the application domain , the concept of power can also be used for describing potential benefits digital design tools yield . While Jacob et al . ( 2008 ) describe abstract beneficial properties of digital technology and interaction techniques that may fit all kinds of application domains , the analysis in section 3 . 1 cares for a characterization of such features within the domain of creativity support tools and hence may be used accordingly . In the proceedings of this thesis , following aspects derived from section 3 . 1 . 4 are used for characterizing the notion of power : fluency , visibility , awareness , accessibility , functionality and storage . Within the design of hybrid design tools , these most promising aspects of technology in the context of design practice are meant to guide design decisions for improving design practices . Figure 3 . 14 : Tradeoff decisions between characteristics of design practice and computational power . Visualizing tradeoffs along the reality vs . power continuum reveals relations between specific tradeoffs and the overall system design . As depicted in Figure 3 . 14 ( left ) , tradeoff decisions can be devised between properties within each theme of embodied design practice ( left ) and computational augmentation ( right ) . For example , reality p o w e r T1 T2 T3 externalization ( NP ) reflection ( BAS + EAS ) collaboration ( SAS ) process fluency accessibility storage awareness visibility functionality Designing for Embodied Work Practices 98 characteristics of Externalization ( NP ) may be traded or augmented with computational features such as functionality ( e . g . precision ) and fluency ( e . g . digital hands - on interaction modalities ) . Characteristics concerning Reflection may primarily benefit from digital features that increase visibility and accessibility . Similarly , Collaboration may be augmented with the properties of fluency , awareness and accessibility . Eventually , the theme of Process may be enhanced by storage , or digital functionality that extends or augments existing workflows . A digital design tool however is not only defined by one single tradeoff decision , but rather it is composed of several tradeoffs that address different parts of a system design . The Reality vs . Power continuum diagram ( see Figure 3 . 14 , right ) can be used to visualize the characteristics of these tradeoffs . Tradeoffs that primarily simulate embodied characteristics may be placed along the continuum toward reality ( see Figure 3 . 14 , T1 ) , while tradeoffs that require a significant deviation from traditional practices in order to achieve power , may be placed closer to power ( see Figure 3 . 14 , T3 ) . A desired tradeoff that balances reality and power equally may be placed in between these extremes ( see Figure 3 . 14 , T2 ) . For the design of a system with several tradeoff decisions , it is reasonable to assume that these will influence each other . For example , if the designer decides to choose Digital Pen & Paper for augmenting the theme of Externalization , he may augment functionality and preserve fluency at the same time . Yet , this decision will clearly also influence the potential for other tradeoffs . For example , the use of paper artifacts within a digital tool limits the options for augmenting visibility ( e . g . through a Zoomable User Interface ) . Consequently , all possible tradeoffs should be prioritized before approaching the overall system design . For example , if the designer’s goal is to preserve existing practices as best as possible , tradeoffs that are closer to reality ( e . g . T1 ) should be given dominance against tradeoffs that require a significant change of work practices for the sake of adding power ( e . g . T3 ) . Eventually , during evaluation , the success of all tradeoff decisions may be re - evaluated by observing their effect on situated use . Analytic observations are to be used for examining the true benefits of computational power within each dimension of the thesis framework . For example , once the system was applied to actual work practices , the designer can verify if the tradeoff decisions were adequate and which aspects of practice are either influenced positively or negatively . For example , the use of Digital Pen & Paper could possibly increase computational functionality but also influence other aspects such as the process . This knowledge shall be used for devising design principles or guidelines – contributing to the overall design space of creativity support systems . 3 . 2 . 3 Summary This chapter reviewed existing research within HCI with a focus on supporting embodied work practices . Based on this analysis , a custom design methodology was devised for use within the case studies of this research . The results of this discussion may be summarized as follows : The research area of Post - WIMP and Tangible User Interfaces is an emerging field that poses novel and complex challenges for designers in HCI . The premise of this new category is that these interfaces better support embodied work practices through a combination of physical and digital components . Researchers have proposed various frameworks for understanding and analyzing embodied interactions . These approaches deviate from traditional design foundations by caring for the theory of embodiment as a foundation to HCI . Related Research 99 A review of existing frameworks provided an understanding of the benefits and limitations this new design paradigm brings about . Further , requirements on a design methodology were extracted . Based on the previously identified requirements , a custom design methodology was derived for addressing the research goal of integrating digital functionality with embodied design practices .

It is sought to demonstrate and exemplify application of the proposed design methodology within a specific case . It thereby contributes to RO2 : “Design and develop new digital tools and interaction techniques to preserve and augment specific collaborative design activities” . Accordingly , the research reported in this chapter is based on the previously devised design methodology , including an observation and analysis of this technique in embodied practice and the design of a tradeoff - based novel hybrid digital tool . Further , for addressing RO3 , “Evaluate the developed tools as to assess the success of the proposed research” , a user study for examining the effects of the tool in situated use is reported . In the following , a justification of the chosen design method is given before the design process of the tool 4 Case Selection 102 “AffinityTable” is discussed . Eventually , the relation of this work with that of other researchers and specific contributions to the field of HCI and creativity support are summarized .

A video presentation of the prototype design tool is available online 23 . 4 . 1 Case Selection As previously discussed , creative professionals frequently use structured methods and workflows to work more effectively in group situations ( see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) . This is due to the dynamics of social collaboration that require a systematic approach for achieving productivity . Additionally , certain rules and materials are considered beneficial for controlling social factors , group awareness and coordination in specific design situations . This research focuses on supporting these practices as closely as possible , preserving important aspects of embodied actions by careful application of 22 http : / / research . it . uts . edu . au / creative / emma _ award / results . html 23 http : / / youtu . be / 6ArRBGEGPzA AffinityTable 103 technology where appropriate . Throughout a design process , a variety of methods – for individual and collaborative use – are available to designers . The goal of this case study is hence to investigate one particular method in detail . At the same time , it is desired that this method is representative for a range of related methods as to care for a potential appropriation of the resulting tool by designers . Figure 4 . 1 : Affinity diagramming 24 in practice ( left ) , a resulting diagram ( right ) 25 . Based on a conducted literature review ( see Chapter 2 ) , the design method Affinity Diagramming is sought to be widely used and can also be considered exemplary for various other collaborative design techniques within the category of “Exploration” ( Herring , Jones , et al . , 2009 ) . The method is designed for application in small design teams and is typically used early in the design process for analyzing a design problem or to create first design solutions . When used for analyzing design problems , artifacts or data from field observations or other research activities are used as input . When used for creating design ideas , participants create artifacts themselves that are used as input . Both variants however have the same basic abstract procedure based on three phases ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) : 1 ) Generation : participants individually create content or bring collected artifacts 2 ) Sharing : participants present their artifacts to others and collect them in a shared workspace 3 ) Structuring : participants arrange the artifacts into meaningful clusters to identify affinities ( e . g . categories ) These basic phases can be considered typical for a range of collaborative design methods that have the goal to achieve a shared understanding of design problems or design solutions . For example , the procedure shares characteristics with brainstorming ( Bono , 1995 ) , card sorting ( Nielsen , 1995 ) , and the KJ problem solving method ( Kawakita , 1975 ) . Descriptions of brainstorming however highlight the activities of generation and sharing , while card sorting and the KJ method both emphasize the structuring process . Further , the methods employ different materials and slightly altered rules based on the purpose they are used for . In the following , the focus is on the seemingly most widespread variant of affinity diagramming within the domain of HCI that is practiced with pens , small sticky notes and a shared surface such as a whiteboard or a large wall for generating and reflecting on design problems and design ideas ( see Figure 4 . 1 , left ) . The result of such activities is a hierarchical organized structure of individual ideas concerning a specific design issue or topic ( see Figure 4 . 1 , right ) . The structure is meant to facilitate a common understanding and shared structure for the 24 http : / / www . hcii . cmu . edu / M - HCI / 2006 / MEDRADProject / process - problem - focus . html 25 http : / / www . baran - systems . com / Products / Affinity % 20Diagram % 20for % 20Excel / index _ concept . htm Case Selection 104 proceedings of a design process . Hence , it may be reused as a stimulus input to other design methods in later stages . Beyer and Holtzblatt recommend affinity diagramming for early stages in human - centered design projects as it facilitates inductive reasoning , discovery and consolidation . Because the diagram is built up from individual notes , the process assists the thought process of inductive reasoning , which means that designers are able to go “from the particular to the general , from the known to the unknown” ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 , p . 151 ) , exploring the design space and problem space gradually toward a common understanding . This generative part of the activity is also considered a divergent activity as described in section 2 . 1 . 5 . Further , the technique of bottom - up clustering enables designers to not only engage in active discussion , but also to create an external representation that stimulates discovery and new serendipitous insights from a “larger picture” of previously abstract concepts . The creation of this structure is a convergent activity as it reduces the complexity by linking together similar or related concepts . Eventually , the collaborative method consolidates knowledge from different sources into a single representation , which requires negotiation and cooperation among various stakeholders that are involved in the design process . Hence , it is an effective communication and coordination tool for clarifying different opinions , background knowledge and common directions within the design group . Researchers have proposed several rules for teaching the method to designers and for making affinity diagramming sessions more productive ( Holtzblatt , Wendell , & Wood , 2004 ; Snyder , 2003 ) . The following list of recommendations summarizes the most common rules : Create notes separately in individual workspaces . This ensures that all participants have enough time to think about their contributions without imposing evaluation apprehension ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) . Initially put notes on a wall in random order to avoid implicit pre - clustering . This will make sure all notes are discussed ( Snyder , 2003 ) . Place only one note at a time , reading out the content for others to hear ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) . This cares for group awareness . All participants should be allowed and able to contribute . Avoid single - person responsibility of the diagramming process ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) . If a facilitator directs the session , he needs to carefully pay attention to the process and should avoid interruptions ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) . Participants should respect the notes of others , moving them only after consultation of the author ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) . A note should only go into one cluster . Including duplicate notes unnecessarily increases the complexity of the diagram due to ambiguity ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) . Decide for a time limit or limit the number of notes beforehand . Otherwise , sessions can become boring and exhaustive ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) . Do not use the method in large groups . It works best for small groups between 3 and 5 participants as this size cares for efficient verbal communication and bodily coordination ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) . Limit the content of notes to words , small sentences or sketches . The message of the note needs to be easily recognized by all participants . Too much detail is disrupting ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) . AffinityTable 105 There is no “right solution” to the diagram . The results are always vague and are hence to be understood as proposal only ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) . Holtzblatt et al . also proposed recommendations concerning the use of certain materials and tools to make affinity diagramming effective ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) : Use small artifacts that can be easily handled and moved . Provide a large wall space or whiteboard . A lot of space is needed for re - arranging notes during discussion . Use adhesive sticky notes and not tape . As notes are moved around iteratively , they need to be attached and moved easily . Supply different colors ( e . g . yellow , red , blue , green ) to facilitate the creation of hierarchies and cluster labels . Do not use drawings on the whiteboard / wall itself as these cannot be easily moved . Use black solid markers and thick pens . The handwritings or sketches must be visible to all participants . Clean out distractions . Ensure that participants can concentrate on the content of the diagram instead of other materials ( e . g . private notes , laptop computer ) . The lo - tech approach of affinity diagramming is generally considered a key strength of the method ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ; Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ; Snyder , 2003 ) . By relying on paper material and spatial sense - making , the method is a prime example for embodied design practices as described in section 2 . 2 . Most researchers explicitly and strongly advise the use of traditional media instead of digital tools due to the benefits material and spatial artifacts have for immediacy , fluency , group awareness , accessibility and coordination ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) . Within a separate column in their book “Rapid Contextual Design” Holtzblatt et al . remark to “build your affinity on the wall , not in a tool” : “walls give the team a large space to spread out all the affinity notes , to quickly scan and regroup the labels , and to pair up to complete the affinity building quickly . [ … ] The value of having multiple people build the affinity at once is that simply by mixing up the people , the affinity notes , the pairs , and the general group discussion , the affinity comes to represent the thinking process of the whole team . [ … ] The simple process of building makes it happen . ” ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 , p . 174 ) The authors further argue that digital tools in contrast do not have comparable qualities : “A tool interface is optimized for one person and although one person could build an affinity one affinity at a time it would take an awful long time . [ … ] It is true that we could imagine a team of 10 sitting around the room , each working on their separate computers putting in their set of affinity notes , seeing each other’s groupings , and talking across the table . But come on ! Let’s just wait for the wall - sized display so we can move things naturally , communicate simply , and not get stuck in manipulating a tool while we are trying to think . ” ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 , p . 174 ) . However , there have been multiple approaches for supporting the method through digital systems . Commercially available tools such as CDTools 26 ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ) or StickySorter 27 allow a single - user , desktop - based creation of affinity diagrams . Naturally , they do not conform to the guidelines and recommendations discussed above . In contrast , they change the process and workflow , effectively eliminating the benefits of the method as a group process . Therefore , Holtzblatt et al . recommend the use of such tools only for documenting and making available the results of sessions . Yet , as of the date of this thesis , both tools have been discontinued . Research projects such as the Designer’s Outpost ( Klemmer , Newman , Farrell , 26 http : / / incontextdesign . com / process / cdtools / 27 Microsoft Office Labs prototype , http : / / www . officelabs . com / projects / stickysorter / Analysis 106 Bilezikjian , & Landay , 2001b ) , Brain Storm ( Hilliges et al . , 2007 ) and The Designer’s Environment ( Tse et al . , 2008 ) are attempting to support similar methods with more adequate interaction modalities ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) , however these tool also have limitations regarding the applicability of embodied practices and social guidelines . These limitations will be discussed later in this chapter ( see 4 . 5 . 1 ) . Based on this review – and the detailed analysis of embodied design practice presented in section 2 . 2 – one may summarize that due to the above described characteristics , the case of affinity diagramming is considered especially suitable for the intended research as it 1 ) is a well - defined structured method that is popular within the domain of design , 2 ) is related to other methods and hence cares for appropriation , 3 ) is used within small face - to - face groups , 4 ) includes divergent and convergent characteristics of creativity , 5 ) relies on embodied aspects such as physical artifacts and spatial environments , and 6 ) is poorly supported by digital tools . 4 . 2 Analysis In the following , a detailed empirical analysis of affinity diagramming as situated embodied practice is reported . As proposed by the previously defined tradeoff - driven design methodology , this analysis is based on an observational study . The goal of this investigation is to gain a firm understanding of the interplay between method , social factors and embodied characteristics like materials and spatial arrangements . This knowledge is eventually used for identifying benefits and limitations of traditional practice and their implications for potential tradeoff decisions . 4 . 2 . 1 Observational Study To study the method in detail , HCI students practicing affinity diagramming were observed by two researchers . Figure 4 . 2 : Setting of the observational study . Rules and materials were given based on recommendations of Holtzblatt et al . , ( 2004 ) ; Snyder , ( 2003 ) . The activity was embedded into a simulated design process of a six - month interaction design course on the local university campus . As a mandatory part of the course , weekly hands - on sessions were conducted by the students that had the task to develop a novel , gesture - based concept for an automotive infotainment system . This realistic assignment was given by an invited professional from the German automotive industry . The affinity diagramming session was conducted a week after a simulated stakeholder meeting with this representative . Results of the sessions were reused within the following weeks of methodic design practices such as sketching , storyboarding and prototyping activities . Overall , three groups and fifteen students did participate in the sessions ( 4 - 6 each , N = 15 ) . The work environment and materials were based on the previously discussed guidelines and AffinityTable 107 recommendations ( Holtzblatt et al . , 2004 ; Snyder , 2003 ) . A horizontal ( table ) and a vertical ( whiteboard ) work surface ( see Figure 4 . 2 ) as well as colored sticky notes and pens were supplied . Prior to the sessions , a detailed introduction to the technique and guidance on approaching the design problem was given by the researchers . The students then carried out the design technique independently . However , two researchers were on site and carefully controlled the proceeding and timing . The three group sessions were videotaped and lasted between 1 . 5 and 2 hours . A standing microphone was used on the table to record speech between participants . In addition , each session was observed by a researcher who made structured notes of the group’s activities . Table 4 . 1 : Coding scheme for video analysis and qualitative interpretation . Externalization Reflection Collaboration Process create content Participants write or draw on notes . This can be done with notes lying on the table as well as on notes hanging on the whiteboard . attention on individual Participants focus their attention on another participant of the group . one person Participants present the results of their individual work to the group . They have the full attention of other group members and are rarely disrupted during this presentation . frequency of actions and duration Within each phase of generating , sharing , and discussing Participants spend a certain amount of time on the different characteristics within the categories . The amount and duration of these actions characterize the process . Transitions between phases characterize the workflow . sort personal notes Participants sort notes in their personal workplace . This is done either on their workplace on the table or by sorting notes whilst holding them in their hands . attention on whiteboard Participants focus their attention on the whiteboard . discussion Participants engage in the discussion about particular ideas and issues . Often , several participants talk at the same time and they are disrupted easily . hold note in hand Participants hold notes in their hand . This category is only coded when participants keep the notes in their hand for a longer period of time . attention on table Participants focus their attention on their personal workplace . This can be their personal workplace on the table or in their hands . no interactions Participants do not engage in active communication . sort note on whiteboard Participants attach notes to the whiteboard and / or rearrange their position . For analyzing the activity , the thesis framework with the themes Externalization , Reflection , Collaboration and Process was applied . Hence , based on the procedures of interaction analysis ( Jordan & Henderson , 1995 ) and qualitative content analysis ( Mayring , 2000 ) , separate categories within the four themes were inductively developed for coding the videos . For example , in Externalization , embodied actions with sticky notes were characterized . Similarly , within the theme of Reflection , the visual attention of participants was described . For Collaboration , the interactions between participants such as verbal communication or deictic gestures were identified . As for analyzing Process , the dynamics of the three basic phases of the method , namely generation , sharing and structuring were observed . Doing so , multiple iterations were conducted by two researchers before the coding Analysis 108 scheme was considered to be saturated and sufficiently described the data set . After cleaning up the scheme , the categories presented in Table 4 . 1 remained . Two sub - sets of video - data – one part covering the two phases of generating and sharing notes and one part covering the phase of discussing and structuring notes on the whiteboard – were coded by two independent researchers using the video analysis tool Noldus Observer XT 28 . In order to do so , the video was separated into chunks containing 65 activities in total and both coders were then asked to code the chunks into the previously developed categories . Coding was not exclusive to the categories , which means that one chunk could also be coded into multiple categories . An inter - coder reliability analysis revealed a Cohen’s Kappa of 0 . 86 , which was considered to be satisfactory . The whole data - set was then coded by one researcher . After coding , the corresponding parts of the videos were viewed separately for each category . Thereby , further explanations of each category , especially concerning the motivation for this action ( e . g . why do participants hold notes in their hands ? ) were derived . 4 . 2 . 2 Results and Discussion The analysis of observation data resulted in quantitative and qualitative data . In the following , the results for each theme will be presented and discussed . Figure 4 . 3 : Coding results for the theme Externalization . Concerning participant’s interaction within the theme Externalization , four categories were identified that describe these key interactions within the design sessions ( see Figure 4 . 3 ) . The values describe the percentage of the time the video was coded into the categories for each of the three phases . In the first phase , each participant spent on average 60 % of the time creating content and 56 % on sorting notes within an individual workspace on the table ( see Figure 4 . 4 , a ) . Based on overlapping data within these categories , it was identified that creation of content is tightly coupled with sorting actions in a personal workspace . The qualitative analysis further revealed that participants were utilizing the personal workspace for preparing contents for presentation or to search for inspiration by reflecting on created contents . Nevertheless , the pre - sorting behavior also led to physical restrictions during the transfer of artifacts between workspaces ( e . g . table to whiteboard ) due to the physical distance between these surfaces . Hence , both hands and external artifacts served as mobile devices to move the notes to the whiteboard , but these in turn did not provide sufficient space for participants to sort . Thus , participants frequently tried to find workarounds ( e . g . sort them on the 28 http : / / www . noldus . com / human - behavior - research / products / the - observer - xt 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 % o f t i m e c o d e d i n t o t h e c a t e g o r y Create content Sort personal Hold in hand Sort on whiteboard AffinityTable 109 table , then transfer a part of them onto the books as they carried them to the whiteboard ) . Mostly , participants used mobile piles in their hands ( see Figure 4 . 4 , b ) to keep their artifacts in order when presenting ( 36 % ) or to collect notes during discussion ( 7 % ) . Both the second phase and the third phase were accompanied with sorting actions on the whiteboard ( ~ 13 % ) . Due to the small size of artifacts and their spatial distribution on the whiteboard , mutual blocking occurred when participants were engaging in parallel actions at the partly very crowded whiteboard ( see Figure 4 . 4 , c ) . It was also found that participants frequently used their bodies ( e . g . fingers and arms ) for deictic gestures to emphasize the focus of discussion to other participants ( see Figure 4 . 4 , d ) . Overall , sorting notes into categories required mutual understanding and consensus in the group . Figure 4 . 4 : Examples of embodied actions . Working in a private workspace on the table ( a ) , holding notes in hands ( b ) , discussing note arrangements on the whiteboard ( c ) , deictic references on particular notes ( d ) . Within the theme of Reflection , three categories describing participants’ attention on the physical environment and individual persons were derived from the most frequent coded events across the design sessions . The frequency of these actions is given in Figure 4 . 5 for each of the three categories . In the first phase , participants primarily worked in individual workspaces on the table ( 86 % , see Figure 4 . 4 , a ) . In the third phase , individual attention was mainly distributed between other participants ( 18 % ) and the whiteboard ( 74 % ) . Phase two was characterized by transitions between these workspaces . All groups used the whiteboard as a shared workspace during convergent activities . However , participants made use of their individual workspaces throughout the sessions . Rapid changes of attention between individual and shared workspace as well as between different participants were observed during the third phase . Although it was expected that searching for information was a critical activity , this did not turn out to be the case . Participants did not search for notes on the whiteboard very often and if they did so , they gave up searching if they could not immediately find what they were looking for . When looking for a note on the whiteboard , they either used timely characteristics ( e . g . “We just added a note that was similar to that one . ” ) or searched according to the author of the notes ( e . g . “Didn’t you just add a note that described this issue ? ” ) . Through qualitative analysis , it was further found that when engaging in actions during convergent activities , the view on the vertical surface was frequently blocked by members of the group , limiting access and visibility to the other participants ( see Figure 4 . 4 , c ) . In the theme of Collaboration , three categories described the form of communication that characterized the different phases . The analysis revealed distinct differences in the communication activities between the three phases of the session ( see Figure 4 . 6 ) . In the first phase , most participants were working silently ( 96 % ) as intended by the method , while in phase two communication was dominated by participants presenting their ideas to other group members ( 16 % ) . In phase three , participants leaned toward engaging in discussions about the categorization of notes ( 22 % ) . Thus , the Analysis 110 data describes the transformation from individual work at the beginning of the session to extensive group work at the end of the session , with the activity of presenting one’s individual ideas as the link between these two . As the events were coded individually for each participant , high percentages of silence within phase two ( 79 % ) and phase three ( 77 % ) remains . It was expected that different people take on different roles and responsibilities in the group and thus engage in different activities . Indeed , presenting individual ideas to the group was found to be of a very different nature compared to engaging in the discussion about a particular topic . When presenting their ideas to the group , participants usually stood next to the whiteboard , facing the other members of the group sitting around them . Presenting occurred exclusively in phase two of the session . When presenting , participants made use of the personal workplace ( the place where the notes came from ) , the whiteboard ( where they placed the notes ) and referenced other group members at the same time , which frequently posed a challenge for participants . Discussion ( talking without acting ) was a substantial part of the session , as participants engaged about 15 % of the time of the whole session in this activity . Within this particular activity , group awareness was especially important to keep the communication flow steady . Further , the good visibility and accessibility of the large whiteboard was found to facilitate common reference points . During presentation and discussion the extensive use of deictic gestures was observed . Especially in the third phase of the session , when participants rearranged and sorted the notes into categories , gesturing was inevitable . Participants pointed at regions on the whiteboard but also on particular notes from different positions . Whilst some pointed from the distance , other stood right next to the whiteboard and even touched the notes when pointing at them . Frequently , gesturing from a distance was not successful and participants moved closer to the whiteboard in order to gain pointing precision . Figure 4 . 5 : Coding results for the theme Reflection . Figure 4 . 6 : Coding results for the theme Collaboration . Eventually , the theme of Process is characterized by the relation between the above discussed themes and the frequency and duration of individual activities . From the observational data it was evident that all three phases have distinct characteristics . Within the first phase , participants did work 0 20 40 60 80 100 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 % o f t i m e c o d e d i n t o t h e c a t e g o r y Table Whiteboard Individual 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 % o f t i m e c o d e d i n t o t h e c a t e g o r y Present Discuss No talk AffinityTable 111 primarily in their individual workspaces and did not cooperate directly . At the same time , this was a predominant divergent activity , although participants also engaged in reflection of their own materials to some extent . Regarding the previous discussed guidelines and general recommendations for creativity support ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 ) , this is considered a desired and effective behavior as it ensures the ability to express ideas freely without critique ( reducing evaluation apprehension ) . Within the second phase of presentation , a transition from individual work to communication was observed . As the results show , participants frequently switch their focus of attention between the personal workplace , individuals , and the whiteboard in phase two . This was observed to place a rather high workload on the participants . The most success - critical phase was phase three , which combines individual and closely - coupled collaborative work as well as convergent modes of creativity . As the result of the session is dependent on this critical phase , it is considered most important . It was also the most time consuming of all phases . Concerning creativity guidelines , this phase is the most complex , yielding interplay of social dynamics , material and spatial aspects . The general activity within this phase can be characterized by the individual actions of communicating , observing , reflecting and interacting by pointing , gesturing and grabbing / moving . Potential issues that may harm the overall workflow identified within this phase are a lack of visibility , accessibility and equal access to design material . Table 4 . 2 summarizes the findings from the analysis concerning the most beneficial properties of embodied practice and potential limitations . Table 4 . 2 : Benefits and limitations of embodied affinity diagramming practice . Benefits Limitations Externalization The use of material artifacts is especially efficient for individual ideation and reflection The transfer of artifacts between workspaces and across phases leads to break ups within the workflow Reflection The available whiteboard space is important for reflecting on the process ( overview ) Distribution of notes in spatial distances requires extensive navigation , blocked visibility due to small notes Collaboration Hands - on characteristics of physical artifacts facilitate group awareness Small notes are difficult to reference with gestures , mutual access blocked during discussion Process Physical workspaces and artifacts facilitate social properties such as privacy and shared references The overall workflow is harmed by a lack of smooth transitions between workspaces and process phases 4 . 3 Design As proposed by the devised design methodology , the results of the analysis are used as input to the design process for identifying potential opportunities for digital tool support . Accordingly , explicit tradeoff decisions derived from the analysis are discussed in the following . Thereafter , the design of the prototype design tool AffinityTable is described . First , the chosen workspace design is presented before specific interaction techniques for individual tasks are described . Eventually , technical details on the implementation of the digital tool are briefly summarized . 4 . 3 . 1 Tradeoff Decisions Based on the results of the observational study and the overall analysis of the work domain ( sections 2 . 1 and 2 . 2 ) as well as existing guidelines for creativity support ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 ) , potential tradeoff Design 112 decisions were examined . The goal of this was to identify characteristics that should be preserved because they are considered crucial to the effectiveness and efficiency of the design method . At the same time , potential deviations from physical practice using technology were explored that allow augmenting typical tasks with computational characteristics such as fluency , visibility , awareness , accessibility , functionality and storage ( see section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . Based on the observation data , the role of the physical work environment is sought to have implications for group awareness and social factors like production blocking . Work surfaces were appropriated due to their differences in accessibility of artifacts and available display space . This finding is also supported by empirical conclusions of other researchers , which describe the appropriation of physical surfaces in professional design studios . Thereby , horizontal surfaces such as tables mainly serve as a space for interaction whereas vertical surfaces such as whiteboards are primarily useful for reflection during convergent activities ( see section 2 . 2 . 3 ) . Physical blocking however is likelier to occur on vertical surfaces , while overview on multiple artifacts is limited on horizontal surfaces . Therefore , both types of surfaces may be preserved , but potential enhancements through computational power to increase visibility and accessibility are desirable . During convergent phases , alternations between manipulations and reflections and between detailed discussions of artifacts and coordination activities that required an overview on all created artifacts were observed . These findings are in line with properties of reflective practice as described within section 2 . 2 . 1 . Though , in the case at hand , this behavior also led to coordination and communication issues when dealing with a large number of artifacts during discussion . At some points , participants had problems following discussion due to rapid shifts of attention or because some artifacts on the shared work surface were blocked by other participants . Accordingly , this activity could potentially be supported by technology . From the analysis it was also discovered that individual workspaces are essential for preserving the workflow of the design technique because they moderate social factors like evaluation apprehension by providing a semi - private retreat from the group ( compare to section 2 . 1 . 6 ) . Other social factors like production blocking and free riding are partly addressed by the rules and workflow of the design technique itself . However , issues with the transfer of artifacts between workspaces throughout the sessions were discovered . Consequently , while individual workspaces should be preserved , the transfer could potentially be improved with computational functionality . A possible solution to these tradeoffs could be a digital workspace that replicates the physical properties for action and reflection activities , but at the same time provides additional features to enhance equal access and group awareness , thereby fostering shared understanding in the group . Concerning the use of physical artifacts it was found that these are especially useful during individual divergent activities , in which a large number of different artifacts are created in rapid cycles . Participants used paper notes efficiently within tightly coupled alternations between individual creation and reflection . This is in line with findings from the initial analysis ( section 2 . 2 ) regarding the use of paper in professional design practice . The unique physical affordances of paper artifacts support both fluent access and flexible handling and are thus useful in face - to - face collaboration ( see section 2 . 2 . 5 ) . However , issues with the transfer of physical artifacts between workspaces and their visibility and accessibility during convergent phases were discovered . This is partly due to the small size of the artifacts and their spatial distribution . Nevertheless , this may influence group awareness and coordination ( see section 2 . 1 . 6 ) . A possible solution to these tradeoffs could be to employ hybrid artifacts that have both a physical and digital representation . The physical representation could be used within individual divergent activities , while the digital representation may offer improved visibility ( e . g . magnification ) and improved accessibility ( e . g . parallel access ) . These digital representations would also allow for augmentation of embodied actions such as highlighting , pointing and gesturing that are important for group activities ( see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) . Digital representations would AffinityTable 113 also allow for more advanced functionalities , like duplication , semi - automatic grouping and associations with additional or analytic information that may improve ideation or reflection activities . However , the transformation between these representations needs to be smooth to minimize the costs of this transition . At the same time , digital representations should mimic the affordances of physical artifacts as closely as possible to allow for embodied interactions like deictic gestures that were found to be important forms of expression . On the basis of these arguments , following design tradeoffs ( T ) were devised as a result of an iterative process : T1 : preserve the physical workspace setting T2 : preserve individual ideation and reflection with physical artifacts T3 : support fluent handling of digital artifacts during convergent activities T4 : augment collaborative actions with more equal access and better visibility of artifacts T5 : augment reflection activities for improving coordination and group awareness T6 : augment the process with automatic storage and additional functionality . Figure 4 . 7 exemplifies a projected placement of these tradeoffs along the reality vs . power continuum . Tradeoffs that have the aim to preserve physical practices hence are closer to “reality” as tradeoffs that support the method with digital interaction modalities . These may not entirely simulate physical properties . Tradeoffs that are related to digital - only functionality are close to the extreme of “power” , as they significantly augment the process and workflow of the method with functionality that is not available in material practice . Figure 4 . 7 : Tradeoff decisions along the reality vs . power continuum . While T1 strives to preserve reality as closely as possible , it hardly adds power . Hence , it is placed toward the extreme of reality and hence should be given a high priority within the design process . This tradeoff is necessary to ensure the primary goal of preserving the original workflow of the design method ( e . g . individual workspaces vs . shared workspace ) . Similarly , T2 also has the goal to entirely preserve physical characteristics without adding computational power ( e . g . use of paper notes for individual work ) . As ideation with physical artifacts was recognized as efficient , no need for alteration of this practice is required . T3 departs from closely imitating reality in order to gain possible benefits through the use of digital artifacts . However , the goal should be to transfer important characteristics of physical artifacts and sacrifice less important characteristics for computational power . Hence , the tradeoff is placed in - between power and reality . reality p o w e r T3 T2 T1 T4 T5 T6 Design 114 T4 , T5 and T6 add digital features to the method which are not feasible in the real world . They significantly depart from reality by offering computational tools such as increased accessibility , visibility , improved group awareness and storage as well as supplemental functionality . As these tradeoffs are rather optional for the basic workflow of the method itself , they should be given less priority within the design process . These tradeoffs should hence be designed in a way that does not negatively influence other tradeoffs . 4 . 3 . 2 Workspace Design Within a first step toward a concrete design proposal , potential workspace designs were approached that may enable a realization of all tradeoff decisions as a hybrid digital tool . Therefore design ideas in the form of paper sketches were iteratively developed and checked against the requirements posed by the tradeoff decisions . Figure 4 . 8 shows some of these early sketches that were developed as a result of collaborative design sessions . Figure 4 . 8 : Iterative sketching activities were conducted as a foundation to the workspace design ( sketches by Ulrike Pfeil ) . Because T1 and T2 were given priority , a first step was to develop an adequate workspace setting that is suitable as a foundation to the remaining tradeoffs . Yet , it was also examined if technologies are available to further approach interaction techniques for the remaining tradeoffs . In doing so , it was ensured that T3 to T6 do not conflict with the basic characteristics and workflow of the method in embodied practice and that the interaction techniques complement the workspace setting . Rather than recounting this time - consuming and dynamic design process , the following descriptions refer to the final workspace design that was eventually decided upon . AffinityTable 115 Figure 4 . 9 : Final workspace design : shared action space ( a ) , reflection space ( b ) , personal spaces ( c ) and transfer spaces ( d ) . With the aim of preserving the physical workspace setting ( T1 ) , the basic layout of one horizontal and one vertical work surface was kept . However , these were replicated with interactive displays rather than traditional work surfaces . This design decision allows using dynamic visualizations of digital representations of artifacts , such as magnification , interactive manipulation and navigation , which are the key to multiple other tradeoffs ( T3 , T4 , T5 , T6 ) . Figure 4 . 9 shows the final workspace design , which is based on a large interactive table for collaboratively interacting with artifacts and a very high - resolution wall display . The table is used for interacting with digital artifacts ( shared action space , see Figure 4 . 9 , a ) , while the vertical display is used for reflection ( shared reflection space , see Figure 4 . 9 , b ) . Thereby , the particular benefits of both types of surfaces are preserved , but manipulations are concentrated on a horizontal surface that is equally accessible to all participants – hence increasing accessibility . Because in this setting , the vertical display cannot be blocked , it further improves the visibility of artifacts . However , this decision either requires a transfer of artifacts from the action space to the reflection space or a virtual workspace across these displays . Because the effort of transferring artifacts is to be minimized , it was chosen to provide different “views” onto a virtual workspace that spans across both displays . Thereby , the table only displays a magnified region ( detail view ) of the whole workspace , which is shown on the vertical display ( overview , see Figure 4 . 9 , a ) . Consequently , the same digital representation of a note is available on both displays . The detail view can be navigated within the whole workspace via panning gestures on the table . A focus box on the vertical display visualizes the view that is currently displayed on the table ( see Figure 4 . 9 , b ) . The coupled vertical display can then also be used for dynamic views on selected artifacts during phases of discussion . Since a primary goal was to preserve individual work with physical artifacts ( T2 ) , digital pen & paper is employed for supporting individual ideation and reflection activities . Therefore , the table offers individual workspaces on its non - interactive rim ( personal spaces , see Figure 4 . 9 , c ) . By providing small paper notes and multiple digital pens , the ability for individuals to create and reflect upon their contributions in a natural way is preserved . Notes are copied into the digital workspace by placing them on the table surface . Thus , the transfer of artifacts from individual workspaces ( rim of the table ) into the shared collaborative workspace ( interactive table region ) is smoothly integrated . After a transfer of physical artifacts into the digital workspace , additional functionalities that augment b a c d Design 116 the method ( T4 , T5 , T6 ) are enabled . Personalized interactive areas at the corners of the table ( transfer spaces , see Figure 4 . 9 , d ) are provided to care for personalized actions within the digital workspace . These interactive zones can be accessed by multiple users at the same time using buttons in each corner of the table . Once enabled , these spaces then provide optional functionality . 4 . 3 . 3 Interaction Techniques As a second step toward the design of a holistic system for supporting the design method , a series of interaction techniques were developed to address the tradeoff decisions . Again , iterative sketching was conducted to envision adequate interaction concepts . Figure 4 . 10 depicts several options for interacting with digital notes to support the basic tasks of affinity diagramming such as adding , clustering , moving and arranging notes . Further concepts were developed for navigating and controlling the interactive views onto the shared workspace using gestural and tangible interaction modalities . Figure 4 . 10 : Sketches for interacting with digital notes on the table to support the clustering of notes ( sketches by Ulrike Pfeil ) . In the following , the final interaction techniques that were eventually implemented are described . Along with the descriptions , the addressed tradeoff decisions are referenced accordingly . Hybrid interaction techniques were designed to support the basic workflow of affinity diagramming through copying , clustering , piling , and collecting ( T1 , T2 , T3 , T6 ) . Additional functionalities that augment physical practice were integrated with interaction techniques for highlighting , focusing , searching , and image retrieval ( T4 , T5 , T6 ) . Therefore , Figure 4 . 11 presents an overview of the AffinityTable system . Figure 4 . 11 : The AffinityTable system . Adding paper notes from individual workspaces to the shared digital workspace ( left ) . Interacting with tangible tools and multiple views across the digital workspace ( right ) . AffinityTable 117 Copying Physical to Digital Notes Within the first phase of the technique , participants work quietly with paper notes in their individual workspaces around the rim of the table . They are hence able to use the table as their individual workspace as possible in traditional practice ( T1 , T2 ) . When presenting their notes in the second phase , they need to transfer their contents into the shared workspace . Since the shared workspace is digital , a conversion between the physical and a digital representation is necessary . AffinityTable supports this transition with the ability to copy physical notes into the shared workspace by placing them on the interactive table ( see Figure 4 . 12 , left ) . A digital representation of the physical note then appears exactly underneath the note on the table surface . This digital copy is displayed within the virtual workspace ( on both displays ) , while the physical copy can be kept in the personal workspace . Users may manipulate their notes later on by writing or crossing out words on the physical note . These manipulations are synchronized with the digital copy . When placing a note onto the table that was already copied into the workspace , it is not duplicated but moved to this new location instead . Placing notes into the personal transfer spaces ( see Figure 4 . 12 , right ) triggers additional functionality such as text recognition and image search ( see later in this chapter ) . Overall , this technique allows the sharing of artifacts with minimized transfer costs while still preserving the ability to reflect upon all individual contents in the personal workspace throughout the session . It also enables rapid switching between the personal and the shared workspace . Figure 4 . 12 : Writing notes in a personal workspace on the rim of the table ( left ) . Transfer of notes into the shared workspace ( right ) . Clustering and Piling Digital Notes During convergent activities , notes are discussed and organized into meaningful arrangements . Once copied into the shared workspace , AffinityTable supports the handling of digital notes by using typical multi - touch manipulations on the interactive table such as dragging , rotating and flicking gestures . It is also possible to change the color of notes or to delete notes by using buttons on the notes or by using a tangible token ( delete function ) . To facilitate the collaborative organization of notes into groups , a simple clustering algorithm that automatically aligns and associates notes when released close to each other ( see Figure 4 . 13 , a , b , c ) was designed . Piles of notes can be created by releasing notes on top other notes . Clusters and piles can be moved by dragging them with multiple fingers ( see Figure 4 . 13 , d , e , f ) . These interaction techniques were designed with the goal to imitate collaborative sorting actions at the traditional whiteboard as closely as possible through multi - touch manipulations ( T3 ) . However , some of the flexibility that is provided by paper artifacts was traded against the possibilities introduced with digital representations . Nonetheless , since all user action is focused on a horizontal surface , which is accessible to all participants , this might lead to more equal Design 118 access and increased awareness of actions within the group compared to the same interactions on a vertical surface . Figure 4 . 13 : Clustering notes on the digital table . Associating notes with clusters ( a , b , c ) , moving groups of notes with multiple fingers ( d , e , f ) . Collecting Digital Notes When using digital notes , collecting individual notes or clusters of notes from arbitrary locations within the shared workspace can become a tedious task . Moving them individually via touch and panning manipulations across longer distances in the virtual workspace can be exhaustive . In physical practice , notes can be collected into mobile piles , which was a popular strategy among the observed subjects in the analysis . AffinityTable replicates this ability by providing multiple two - sided tangible objects called “collector tokens” ( see Figure 4 . 14 ) . By placing the colored side of these tokens on digital notes , they become selected ( see Figure 4 . 14 , a , b ) . By turning over the token ( Figure 4 . 14 , c ) and placing it on the table with the blank side , selected notes are moved to this new location ( see Figure 4 . 14 , b ) . This technique hence allows converting physical movement into virtual movement by preserving some of the original physical characteristics ( T3 ) . Figure 4 . 14 : Collecting digital notes with the collector token . Multiple notes are selected with the colored side ( like stamping an object ) . By turning over the token on a new location , selected notes are moved to this place . Highlighting Digital Notes During discussion , deictic references on notes were often used as a form of communication and for coordination in the group . AffinityTable augments these interactions by providing additional AffinityTable 119 awareness of deictic pointing gestures . When touching digital notes , they are highlighted around their border with a glowing effect . Each highlight fades out after five seconds . This fading is also visible on the context display and thus can be used for deictic gestures across displays . When clustering notes , the fading glow implicitly communicates a history of actions that may help participants to remember the current focus of discussion if they got lost in the process . Therefore , this interaction technique focuses on promoting the chance for individual reflection and on fostering group awareness ( T4 , T5 ) . Figure 4 . 15 : The fokus token allows selecting a region on the table for a magnified view on the vertical display . Rotating the token increases or decreases the degree of magnification . Focusing on Specific Notes Similarly , a physical “focus token” can be used to focus on a specific region within the virtual workspace during discussion ( see Figure 4 . 15 , right ) . By placing this token onto the table , a region within the virtual workspace is selected for a detailed view on the vertical display . By turning the token ( see Figure 4 . 15 , a ) , the users can increase or decrease the magnification of the view on the vertical display . By lifting the token from the table , the original view is restored . This interaction technique aims at improving group awareness and coordination . Because all other artifacts are temporarily hidden when using the token ( except the immediate surroundings on the table ) , this technique is a powerful tool that allows placing focus on selected artifacts in order to moderate discussion and reflection ( T5 ) . It also minimizes physical movements and mutual blocking . However , particular dominant members of the group may also use this tool for gatekeeping . Searching for Authors Although participants of our study did not have a strong need to search for particular notes , a lightweight search function based on the author of a note was integrated . Through the use of digital Design 120 pens , all content can be associated to the particular author . By tapping personal symbols that are available in the transfer spaces at the corners of the table ( see Figure 4 . 16 , a ) , the notes created by the corresponding user are marked with that symbol ( see Figure 4 . 16 , b ) . This allows participants to look up the responsible author of a particular issue or idea during discussion . It also allows analyzing participants contributions to certain clusters and thus may provide information about consensus in the group ( T5 , T6 ) . This search function may introduce positive effects by reducing free riding , but may also have negative effects by increasing evaluation apprehension ( see section 2 . 1 . 6 ) . However , since notes are anonymous throughout the session and identity is only revealed on demand , this technique may stimulate individual contributions without putting too much pressure on participants . Figure 4 . 16 : Searching for the author of notes ( left ) . Retrieving images from the web based on the content of notes . Image Retrieval based on the Content of Notes Along the presentation and discussion of ideas , it was observed that participants could benefit from additional functionality . Clarifying issues through information retrieval may help to make a clear point . Therefore , an image retrieval functionality based on the content of notes was added . When placing notes into the transfer spaces at the corners of the table , five images that are related to the words on the note are retrieved from the web and displayed around the physical note ( see Figure 4 . 16 , right ) . Users may then drag the digital images along with a copy of the physical note into the shared workspace ( see Figure 4 . 16 , c , d ) . Images in the workspace can be clustered along with the digital notes . Hence , they can also be used to visually point out important clusters by adding representative images . This technique may have a positive influence on fixation effects because the selection of images can be used to further open up divergent activities ( T5 , T6 ) . Instead of using images from the web , this technique may also be used to augment notes with other data from custom design knowledge repositories . Table 4 . 3 summarizes the potential benefits of the discussed interaction techniques , system features and corresponding tradeoff decisions within the themes of the thesis framework . AffinityTable 121 Table 4 . 3 : System features of AffinityTable and their potential benefits in relation to the themes of the thesis framework . Externalization Reflection Collaboration Process Use of physical notes in individual workspaces preserves workflow characteristics ( T1 ) Adding notes to the shared workspace by copying eases transitions between workspaces ( T2 ) The overview display provides a shared reference to all participants and increases visibility ( T5 ) Focusing and highlighting augment navigation abilities for reflection activities ( T5 ) Constrained interaction space ( table ) and use of tangible tools augments awareness and accessibility ( T4 ) Clustering , piling , collecting supports the basic workflow of the method ( T3 ) The method is augmented with additional functionality such as image retrieval , author search , and storage & documentation ( T6 ) 4 . 3 . 4 Implementation AffinityTable has been implemented in a collaborative effort using a series of progressive technologies such as optical touch recognition , fiducial markers , computer vision processing , gesture recognition , digital pen & paper streaming , network synchronization and zoomable user interface navigation techniques . In the following , only the most fundamental aspects of the implementation will be briefly summarized as the focus of this research is conceptual rather than technical . Further details on the employed technologies and toolkits can be found in related publications ( Budzinski , 2012 ; Jetter , Gerken , Zöllner , & Reiterer , 2010 ; Jetter , Zöllner , Gerken , & Reiterer , 2012 ; Kaltenbrunner & Bencina , 2007 ; König , Rädle , & Reiterer , 2010 ) . Figure 4 . 17 : Technical workspace architecture of the AffinityTable system . The fundamental workspace ( see Figure 4 . 17 ) of the tool is based on a custom - built interactive table that measures 128cm x 157cm x 105cm . The table accommodates three to five individuals that may face each other in a circular arrangement around the table . The non - interactive rim of the table ( 20cm ) supports leaning , offloading personal items and cares for avoiding involuntary interaction . The graphics of the interactive surface embedded in the table are rear - projected with a WUXGA projector ( 1900px x 1200px resolution ) . Multi - touch and object recognition is provided with IR separate software clients • network connected • central database • synchronized content • remote navigation digital pen & paper • custom paper notes • wireless connection • stroke processing • text recognition touch & marker tracking • object recognition • touch gesture processing Design 122 illumination and three tiled XGA cameras ( 1024px x 768px ) . The frameworks ReacTIVision ( Kaltenbrunner & Bencina , 2007 ) and Squidy ( König et al . , 2010 ) are employed for optical marker recognition and multiple finger tracking . Both , paper notes and tangible objects are recognized using the ReacTIVision framework . Multi - touch gesture recognition and all interface components ( e . g . notes , buttons ) and some interaction techniques ( e . g . clustering , highlighting ) were implemented using the Microsoft Surface SDK 1 . 0 29 , which is based on the Windows Presentation Foundation ( WPF ) framework 3 . 5 30 . The vertical display used as reflection display measures 76cm x 162cm and features 4K resolution ( 4096px x 2160px ) . It was mounted within close proximity to the long edge of the interactive table to minimize the effort of switching visual attention between both workspaces . The non - interactive visualization on the display is remotely controlled via the table through client - server networking infrastructure . Similarly , the content of both displays is synchronized using a central database system . These cross workspace synchronization methods and navigation techniques such as zooming and panning were implemented using the ZOIL framework ( Jetter , Zöllner , et al . , 2012 ) . The system runs on two networked workstations with the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system 31 . Interface items on the table ( e . g . notes ) were scaled to match the size of real objects . However , the reflection display uses smaller representations of the notes to care for overview . The scaling of the virtual workspace can be adapted to accommodate a virtually unlimited number of artifacts . However , it is to mention here that the amount of available space in the virtual workspace is directly related to the effort of spatial navigation on the table . Hence , for the prototype , the scale was designed to include roughly 200 notes by also preserving readability of the content from the standing distance at the table . Additionally , the stroke thickness of the digital notes was increased to ease distant visual recognition . Figure 4 . 18 : Custom two - sided tokens , custom digital pen & paper notes , Anoto Digital Pen ADP - 301 . The paper notes ( see Figure 4 . 18 ) were designed to be the same size of traditional sticky notes . Because Anoto only supplies digital paper in A4 format , six notes were cut from each page . Pen strokes made on these notes are transferred to the system using a wireless Bluetooth connection . Data from multiple Anoto ADP - 301 digital pens is received and processed using the Anoto streaming API 32 .

The Yahoo Image Search Service 34 and the Microsoft Bing search services 35 were employed for retrieving digital images from the web . All interface components and their contents are persistently stored in a central database system , thus allowing distributed access for later reuse of session results or for continuing sessions . Consequently , a small client application was developed that can be used on traditional desktop workstations . It allows exploring created diagrams in a mouse - operated zoomable user interface and also includes simple data export functionality . 4 . 4 Evaluation For testing the design hypotheses exemplified in AffinityTable , an evaluation is required . Hence , according to the research objective RO3 , “Evaluate the developed tools as to assess the success of the proposed research” , a user study was conducted . Based on the design methodology applied within the analysis and the design of the system , the investigation is also centered on the previously devised tradeoff decisions ( see section 4 . 3 . 1 ) . 4 . 4 . 1 User Study In order to adequately address the research question , it is desired that a user study produces knowledge about the relation of the digital tool to the previously identified characteristics of embodied design practices . Further , the study should give insights about the extent in which the initial tradeoffs that were the foundation to the design of the system are affecting the methodic aspects of group work . Accordingly , the goal of this study was not to measure the usability , efficiency or effectiveness of the developed interaction techniques . Rather , the goal was to evaluate the adequacy of the proposed tradeoff decisions and the holistic effects of the developed workspace design and interaction techniques on work - related aspects such as the workflow and social dynamics . As previously discussed ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 ) , the study of creativity support systems is a complex issue that is dependent on many different dynamic aspects such as individual creative ability , group composition , task variation and the overall situation within a design process . Researchers hence argue that a quantitative comparative study involving a measurement of explicit variables will not be adequate to care for the dynamics of creative group work ( Reinig , Briggs , & Nunamaker , 2007 ) . Therefore , based on recommendations by related research ( Shneiderman , Jennings , et al . , 2006 ) a situated use of the tool within a realistic context and qualitative research methods were desired ( see section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . To study how AffinityTable supports embodied practices for the design method affinity diagramming , a user study with four groups of students ( 3 - 4 participants each , N = 13 ) was conducted . The study was designed as a qualitative observational study in a lab on the local campus ( see Figure 4 . 19 ) . For the study , the same students that took part in the initial observation ( see section 4 . 2 . 1 ) were invited . Hence , all participants were graduate students in HCI and already had practical proficiency with the design method . Further , most of them worked together within a design team before . The average age was 25 . 8 years , ranging from 23 to 32 . All participants had previous experiences in using multi - touch devices such as smartphones or tablet computers . In the beginning of the study , the participants were introduced to the functionality of the design tool by one researcher who demonstrated the workspace setting and each interaction technique . The subjects also had the chance to try out all functionalities for themselves . They were then given a specific design problem to solve collaboratively . All groups were given the same task , which was to envision a novel interactive tool or 33 http : / / www . microsoft . com / en - us / download / details . aspx ? id = 3138 34 http : / / images . search . yahoo . com / 35 http : / / www . bing . com / developers / Evaluation 124 appliance that could save energy in the household . The task assignment included the exploration of design problems as well as potential design solutions . Each affinity diagramming session lasted about one hour and was observed by two researchers who made structured notes of the group’s activities . Two video cameras were set up to record the sessions , which allowed for detailed post - study analysis of critical incidents . The recording angles of the cameras were designed to cover both horizontal and vertical workspaces . Moreover , participants filled out questionnaires before and after the sessions . This data allowed assessing the general perception of the tool design . Eventually , a semi - structured focus group was conducted after the sessions in which participants were questioned about their experiences with the tool and specific interaction techniques . The overall duration of one study trial was about two hours . 4 . 4 . 2 Results and Discussion In the following , the results of a qualitative analysis are presented and discussed along the tradeoff decisions that characterize the system design . Therefore , the tradeoffs are examined starting with those that strive toward preserving or replicating traditional practices ( T1 , T2 , T3 ) . Concerning these decisions , it is to investigate if their manifestation in concrete interaction techniques was successfully applied – hence preserving crucial characteristics of traditional practice . Later , tradeoff decisions that augment the design method ( T4 , T5 , T6 ) are examined by looking at the potential negative or positive effects they might yield for changing the social dynamics and process or workflow of the method . Figure 4 . 19 : Setting of the user study - individual and collaborative workspaces . One of the key decisions made within the first tradeoff ( T1 ) was to preserve the physical workspace setting and thus provide a horizontal ( table ) as well as a vertical ( wall display ) surface . Further , it was decided to keep the division into shared and personal spaces to allow for individual ideation and reflection ( T2 ) . Yet , for being able to add further functionality , these work surfaces were replicated within a virtual workspace across two displays in order to ease the transfer between them and to allow for a smoother iteration between action and reflection . Results of the questionnaires show that participants highly appreciated the table for collaborative manipulations , while stating that the vertical display effectively supports overview reflection on the process . Participants for example used the overview display to identify isolate notes or to evaluate the structure of the diagrams like the size of clusters and the hierarchy of notes . One of the consequences of this virtual workspace is a duplicate existence of notes within : 1 ) the personal workspace ( on paper ) , 2 ) the shared workspace view on the table , and 3 ) the shared workspace view on the overview display . One may assume that this duplication might lead to confusion . However , participants did not encounter any complications with AffinityTable 125 the hybrid representation ( physical / digital ) and duplicate appearance of the same notes during the session . In contrast , participants discovered potential in the reuse of the physical artifacts after the ideation phase . For example , some kept browsing through their physical notes long after they had been digitalized in order to get inspiration for further ideas – something that is not possible in traditional practice . Likewise , one group used multiple physical notes in order to move digital representations into clusters ( see Figure 4 . 20 , left ) . This work style – although not intended by the design of the system – did not lead to uncontrolled behavior but rather proofed to be an alternative clustering strategy . Considering the personal workspaces , the study found that participants efficiently used the rim of the table to create and sort their notes into sequences or piles , just like they did in traditional practice . Nevertheless , the experience could possibly be improved by providing a slightly larger rim for supporting more refined spatial arrangements . Participants did not encounter any difficulties in transferring physical notes onto the table as it was observed in the initial user study . Rather , this interaction was mostly performed smoothly , even for pre - sorted collections of notes that some participants transferred as collections to the table . Overall , considering the tradeoffs T1 and T2 , no violations of the original workflow or embodied practice could be observed . Conversely , important characteristics of the physical workspace were preserved whilst also enabling additional functionalities . Figure 4 . 20 : Hybrid use of notes ( left ) , simultaneous interactions during clustering ( right ) . The goal of the tradeoff T3 was to support the handling of digital artifacts within convergent activities such discussion and sorting . During the study , it was observed that participants did not encounter major difficulties with clustering and piling digital artifacts on the table . The style of the multi - touch interaction techniques such as rotating , moving or skipping notes seems to be a close enough fit to participant’s experiences with interacting with physical artifacts . However , some participants commented that the fluency could be improved by faster and more precise touch recognition . Although it was possible for all group members to work on the table concurrently , simultaneous interactions were mostly negotiated in the group before they were executed , similar to the behavior we observed in real practice . Although technically possible , concurrent interactions were not observed frequently . This may be due to the fact that interactions of multiple users may still interfere with each other , e . g . when one participant tries to move the current view on the table and others seek to work on clustering notes ( see Figure 4 . 20 , right ) . Hence , it remains unclear if the table stimulates more simultaneous contributions than traditional practice . Participants however generally appreciated the automatic alignment and association of notes into clusters . Yet , due to inaccurate finger tracking , dragging clusters quickly over a long distance on the table often led to the interaction being interrupted – breaking the flow of some clustering activities . With regard to the collector token , participants only rarely made use of it for transferring notes within the workspace . Rather , they seemed to be quite emerged in the activity of interacting with the notes through direct touch . This Evaluation 126 was further strengthened by the fact that the tokens were not essential for completing the session as the number of artifacts remained rather small throughout all session . Participants however perceived the tangible tools as useful and stated that they might become more useful when the amount of artifacts increases . Hence , a longer , more elaborate design session seems to be necessary for investigating these aspects in more detail . Overall , concerning tradeoff T3 , one may conclude that the implementation did generally support the original workflow of the design technique . At the same time however , it clearly sacrifices some fluency that is inherent in handling entirely physical artifacts . The goal of tradeoff T4 was to augment collaborative actions by improving equal access and visibility of shared artifacts . This may be evaluated by observing the use and appropriation of the provided workspaces . In the beginning of the sessions , participants mostly focused their attention on the table because primary interaction such as copying and presenting notes as well as moving notes was concentrated onto this work surface . None of the participants stated that this procedure had negative effects on their individual contributions to the process . In contrast , the subjects did not state a need to add notes directly to the overview display . Toward the end of the sessions , reflection became more important and participants more often focused on the overview display during discussion . This tendency was further strengthened by the fact that none of the four created diagrams fitted onto the table view and thus the overview display was indispensable in order to gain a comprehensive view on the work progress . Hence , it becomes more important when dealing with a larger number of artifacts , a larger virtual workspace , and more complex diagrams during more extensive design sessions . Just as participants did not express the need for adding notes to the vertical display directly , they also did not miss the ability to manipulate contents directly on the overview display . As intended by the tradeoff , the vertical display did not get blocked in any of the sessions , thereby offering continuous visibility of artifacts to all participants . At the same time , accessibility was provided on the table . Participants stated that they were in control of the content on the table at all times . Hence , the study showed that T4 successfully constrained the space for interaction while improving the visibility of artifacts . Tradeoffs T5 and T6 had the goal to augment reflection activities and the workflow of the method itself . This included support for coordination and group awareness such as interaction techniques for focusing and highlighting notes . A focus token was implemented as well as the ability to search for notes based on the author . Additionally , a lightweight and fluent ability to retrieve images based on the content of notes was provided within the transfer spaces on the table . In the study , the focus token was primarily used for detailed explorations of notes that included a sketch or for focusing on images . Although it was expected that it would be used on small unreadable handwritings , it turned out to be most useful for “admiring” individual contributions during presentation and discussion . Due to the exceptionally high resolution of the vertical display , text and sketches already stand out from a larger distance and based on the ability to remotely highlight notes by touch , it was not required for notes that contain text only . The search function was hardly used during the sessions , but at the end of sessions and during discussion . This might be due to the fact that it is hidden in the transfer spaces and is only available on demand . When participants were asked , some stated that it is most useful at the end of sessions or when reusing the diagram at later times because it might help to remember the process . This confirms the design decision to provide on demand access only in order to prevent negative effects on the workflow . The picture retrieval functionality was very well received among participants . However , it was assumed that it would be used primarily for searching for inspiring images . Rather , participants tried to find pictures that helped to clarify the content of their notes . All pictures were eventually added to clusters ( see Figure 4 . 21 ) . One participant stated that including pictures might help to quickly communicate the basic content of the clusters . Overall , the functionality clearly triggered lively discussions among participants . However , it was also found that it changes the workflow of the affinity diagramming session when used by untrained people . In one AffinityTable 127 group , it led to an early transfer of physical notes into the shared workspace as participants were curious to work with the pictures and thus placed their notes onto the table right after writing on them instead of waiting until their turn for presentation . In this case , the pictures also encouraged participants to transfer each note individually instead of digitalizing them in pre - sorted clusters . Yet , this is likelier to occur with inexperienced first - time users that are curious about the interface and functionality of the tool itself . Overall , one may summarize that the interaction techniques within T5 and T6 generally did not conflict with the workflow of affinity diagramming whilst providing additional functionality at the same time . The usefulness of the particular functionalities and their effects on the outcome of affinity diagramming sessions can however only be assessed based on the subjective feedback of the participants . The results of the focus group indicate that automatic storage , overview over the process , and the image retrieval integration are the most favored characteristics of AffinityTable . Yet , it was also observed that participants were mostly passionate and engaged with use of the system . Nearly all participants agreed that they enjoyed using the system and prescribed innovation to its design . Figure 4 . 21 : Resulting diagram of one AffinityTable session . Images were mostly used for emphasizing cluster contents . After describing the results of the individual design decisions and tradeoffs , the potential overall impact of AffinityTable on the design method affinity diagramming will be discussed . As one the main research goal was to preserve the important aspects of embodied practice whilst still adding functionality , the relation of the tool to these characteristics may be evaluated ( see section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . For doing so , this analysis focuses on the social dynamics and workflow yielded by the new tool and potential conflicts with digital features . The most successful design decisions in this regard can be considered the preserving aspects such as the overall workspace design and the support for paper artifacts within individual ideation and sharing activities . Both decisions were accepted naturally by participants and did not pose any barriers to embodied work practices and social factors . Indeed , participants stated that the use of digital pen & paper is very similar to the use of traditional pens and hence preserves the important social feature of privacy which may limit evaluation apprehension ( see section 2 . 1 . 6 ) . Further , the variations of the original process by introducing the copying technique were not influencing the general workflow of the technique . In contrast , the workspace division in individual areas on the table rim , a shared area for presenting and exchanging notes , and a shared display for reflecting upon the process proved to be beneficial . No issues with production blocking could be identified . Duplicate appearance of externalizations was not confusing to participants and the physical proximity of individual and shared Evaluation 128 work surfaces did not influence the workflow in a negative way . Further , no complications with transferring artifacts between these spaces have been observed , in contrast it may be assumed that this transfer was smoother than in traditional practice . This further strengthens the design decisions of tradeoffs T1 and T2 . However , for harnessing the benefits of these tradeoffs , the use of entirely digital artifacts within the remaining phases of the method was required . As additional functionality is only enabled through a transformation of physical artifacts to digital representations , the further proceedings of the process needed to be supported with digital or hybrid interaction modalities . This proved to be challenging for the tasks of handling digital artifacts on the table within sorting and clustering phases . Although the direct touch interaction style on the table was generally found to be similar to original sorting interactions on the whiteboard , issues with unreliable touch recognition and poor optical tracking performance led to the perception that the quality of interacting with these digital artifacts is not entirely comparable to the rich affordances of interacting with physical artifacts . This of course highly depends on the implementation of multi - touch interaction techniques and the supplied hardware . Hence , it is one major area for future improvement . Yet , regarding the use of the table as primary interaction space , one may conclude that this decision did not interfere with social dynamics or the workflow of the method . Rather , the results of the study indicate signs of increased group awareness based on the high degree of attention and engagement participants had throughout all sessions ( T4 ) . Nevertheless , the constrained interaction space also brings about limitations in navigating the virtual workspace . As only a part of the entire workspace is visible at a given time on the table , panning operations need to be coordinated in the group . This again requires negotiation between the members of the design group – hence increasing the need for social bargaining . Similar issues have however also been observed on the whiteboard as primary work surface , as this also needs to be navigated by physical , bodily movements . Hence , the tradeoff T3 effectively converts physical movement into digital movement . Accordingly , the constrained interaction space did not fundamentally alter these navigational characteristics of the workflow . Tradeoffs that were in the category of augmentation can mostly be considered a success because they are optional to the workflow of the method itself . For example , reflection support with the interaction techniques searching , highlighting and focusing ( T5 ) were well received and only used on demand as necessary . Hence , these interaction techniques do not impact the general proceedings , but provide assistance only when needed . Especially the functionalities of searching and focusing were increasingly beneficial as the number of artifacts and hence the complexity of the content grew . However , the functionalities may be unnecessary for rather short sessions that do not reach that level of complexity . Automatic storage of all artifacts ( T6 ) is a given based on the system design and cannot be considered harmful for the method or social dynamics in any way . Rather , it was consistently rated as one of the most beneficial properties of the system as it enables reuse of design knowledge in later stages of a design process , while at the same time being unobtrusive to the users due to its automatic character . Eventually , the image search functionality ( T6 ) may be seen as a departure from the process due to several reasons . Firstly , as arguably the most “powerful” of all tradeoffs it gives functionalities to the users that are not part of the original method . Using related images within the process proved to be beneficial for highlighting clusters , but also changed the character of the method toward refinement and convergence . Secondly , the ability to search for images based on the content of notes was perceived to be some kind of “magic” that participants like to play with a lot . Although this may be seen as beneficial for the engagement of the group as a whole and certainly stimulates motivation – and hence lessens social loafing – it leads to a different outcome and discussion . In one group it entirely broke the traditional proceeding as participants were eager to work with the images rather than toward the shared goal of an affinity diagram . Hence , this example proves that an increase of powerful functionality can indeed conflict with traditional workflows in unexpected ways . Regarding the research question initially posed , one may however conclude that the AffinityTable 129 design was able to preserve the general workflow by still adding some power with a digital tool – under the awareness of the changes yielded by appropriation of augmented functionality . When reflecting upon the entire design process , one may devise some implications for a redesign of AffinityTable or for the design of similar creativity support tools . Other researchers may use these experiences as a foundation to future design proposals . Hence , following recommendations are proposed : Preserving characteristics of traditional practice requires a replication or simulation of many or all features . However , by closely preserving these properties , the potential for additional functionality is limited . Therefore , tradeoffs that are closer to “reality” have to be carefully designed with potential other , more powerful tradeoffs in mind . Supporting traditional practices with a mediocre simulation of realistic features will likely fail . Unexpected behaviors or limitations in fluidity are crucial for preserving the creative flow – especially within group activities . Accordingly , a simulation of physical affordances needs to stand a comparison to physical practice . Augmenting embodied design practices with technology yields great potential . However , powerful digital features need to be carefully balanced with traditional workflows as they are likely to modify or change them – creating something new that is however different in method and result . 4 . 5 Summary & Contributions In the following , the contributions of this case study are summarized . To start with , the AffinityTable system is compared with other related systems and design tools . It is discussed how it differs from existing research and how it contributes to the general design space of creativity support systems by providing extensions or modifications of design concepts . Accordingly , technical contributions as well as empirical contributions are summarized to make this knowledge available to other researchers . 4 . 5 . 1 Related Work AffinityTable is generally related to computing environments for co - located creative group work . In particular it is linked to approaches for supporting collaborative creative design sessions with tangible user interfaces , multiple devices or displays , and multi - touch surfaces ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) . Conceptually , AffinityTable is most closely related to The Designer’s Outpost ( Klemmer et al . , 2001a ) ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) . This hybrid digital tool introduced paper - based interaction techniques in the context of methodic design practices . It also combines physical sticky notes with an interactive display . By using overhead image capture , notes can be combined with digital ink annotations for creating hybrid website diagrams . The system thereby also bridges physical and digital representations to support the documentation and sharing of results . Yet , the tool differs in areas such as multi - user support , reflection support and functionality . For example , it lacks efficient multi - user support by not providing individual workspaces and a shared interaction space . It also lacks a reflection display and interaction techniques for searching , highlighting or focusing . Further , it is only suitable for facilitator - style group interactions , lacking support for group accessibility and awareness . Further , as the hybrid representations remain in workspace that cannot be navigated or zoomed , it only cares for a limited number of artifacts that fit on the whiteboard display . AffinityTable hence extends this approach not only conceptually , but also with additional functionalities . The research in this case study also extends similar vision - based approaches such as Pictionaire ( Hartmann et al . , 2010 ) and Summary & Contributions 130 Cabinet ( Keller et al . , 2006 ) . These tools also combine physical artifacts with digital annotations or clusters and collections on a hybrid tabletop system . However , they focus on the sharing and documentation aspect of digital and physical design artifacts rather than supporting real processes or methods of idea - generation and discussion . AffinityTable is not the first system to use multiple work surfaces in the context of creative group work . Researchers have previously shown that interactive surfaces and multi - display environments can be used to support creative group work . For example , i - LAND ( Streitz et al . , 1999 ) combines interactive surfaces , like tables , walls and mobile devices for supporting fluent creative collaboration and for easing the transfer of information across devices ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) . But , it focuses on the design of an adequate technical infrastructure instead of addressing specific tasks or support for established workflows . Further , the claim of fluency within the system design seems rather limited to today’s technical possibilities . Hence , AffinityTable arguable extends the i - LAND approach with more tangible and fluent interaction techniques compared to entirely digital interaction modalities . Similarly , the presented interaction techniques extend other related systems such as BrainStorm ( Hilliges et al . , 2007 ) . The tool combines multiple pen - operated displays to support creative problem solving processes . Digital notes can be created on an interactive table and transferred to a wall projection for discussion and clustering . Thereby , it provides stylus - based interaction techniques for creating , sharing and clustering of digital notes as well as a dedicated reflection display . Although it also seeks to recreate or to simulate a specific workflow , it does not add supplementary functionalities that significantly augment practice . Further , it is limited regarding its adequacy for real group work as it only supports dyads . Another closely related design tool is The Designer’s Environment ( Tse et al . , 2008 ) that supports the KJ creativity method with multimodal interaction techniques for grouping and linking digital notes on a tabletop system . Handwritten digital notes are sent to the table from multiple Tablet PCs . Text recognition is used on the tablets for retrieving images from the web according to the content of notes . The system hence shares many similarities regarding the table - centric interaction style . However , it is primarily focused on demonstrating novel multimodal interaction techniques for grouping digital notes rather than real workflow support or support for tangible media . Further , it does not support reflection activities . Accordingly , AffinityTable extends this approach with arguable more fluent and flexible interaction techniques . Wider related research can be found in the collaborative design tool TeamStorm ( Hailpern et al . , 2007 ) , which combines multiple Tablet PCs with an interactive whiteboard interface for supporting collaborative sketching sessions . Sketches can be transferred from the mobile devices to the whiteboard for coordinating discussion in the group and for enhancing reflection activities . The system hence shows how technology can be effectively used to support social interactions across digital artifacts . It also relates to traditional workflows and the importance of social dynamics for the system design . However , it is geared toward the support of convergent activities rather than idea generation and synthesis . Consequently , it differs a lot in functionality . Yet , it was an influential inspiration for the research at hand . To summarize , the research discussed in this case study extends existing work with a proposal of novel interaction modalities in the context of support for traditional workflows . By explicitly referring to embodied actions in design collaboration , AffinityTable is arguably a valuable addition to existing design knowledge in the area of collaborative design tools and creativity support systems . Yet , and perhaps most importantly , the case study makes design decisions more explicit than comparable research . Although many of the described approaches share the goal to integrate technology into physical design practice , design decisions are often made implicitly , without stating their relation to existing practice , workflows or their impact on the embodiment of actions . Only rarely , observations of real practices are used to inform the design of these tools . This however , as this study seeks to AffinityTable 131 demonstrate , is a key requirement for learning about the consequences digital tools yield for appropriation in design practices . 4 . 5 . 2 Conceptual and Technical Contributions The case study at hand contributes conceptual and technical solutions in the form of design concepts and interaction techniques . As will be demonstrated in the following , these contributions specifically address technological support for embodied design practices . However , they may not only be useful within the context of design tools and creativity support , but also for the design of collaborative systems in general . Table 4 . 4 summarizes how solutions within AffinityTable address well - recognized limitations of digital creativity support ( see section 3 . 1 . 4 ) as well as established guidelines and requirements for such systems ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 , Table 3 . 2 ) . Table 4 . 4 : AffinityTable addresses limitations as well as guidelines and requirements for creativity support . Externalization Reflection Collaboration Process Copying , digital pen & paper and table transfer are fluent interfaces Storage and retrieval through database persistence Workspace design allows for ad - hoc use Preserves important aspects of the traditional method Hands - on interaction with the clustering techniques and tokens Hand - generated content allows for imprecise representations Workspace territories enables fluent transitions between collaboration modes Automatic documentation through capture and retrieval The interface is hidden from the user – the content is the interface Spatial visualization and dynamic views for comparing ideas Tangible objects provide group affordances ( embodied facilitation ) Augments typical activities through additional functionality Support for annotation , gesturing and moving Convergence support through clustering and focusing techniques System design cares for embodied actions and social factors System designed for and with users AffinityTable also addresses many of the previously analyzed characteristics of embodied practices in design ( see section 2 . 2 ) . For example , it supports rapid cycles of externalization and reflection through a combination of material artifacts and individual and shared workspaces . The use of paper artifacts and tangible objects preserves important characteristics of materiality for individual ideation activities ( see section 2 . 2 . 5 ) . Further , a dedicated reflection display explicitly augments the need for a shared reference and overview during design sessions . Thereby , it combines the benefits of horizontal surfaces with those of vertical displays ( see section 2 . 2 . 3 ) . While the table can be considered a “live surface” ( Vyas , 2009 ) , the wall display takes the function of a “shared surface” . Through integration within a virtual workspace , the benefits of both work areas are merged . The interaction modalities of AffinityTable are also in line with important attributed of sketching activities ( see section 2 . 2 . 2 ) . The system keeps the effort for creating content low by still keeping the benefits of incremental formalization in convergent phases . Embodied actions ( see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) that are important tools for implicit group communication and coordination are supported and augmented with interaction techniques such as highlighting , focusing , and pointing . The tool design also explicitly addresses social dynamics and inhibitors that relate to established design methods ( see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) . Besides its contribution to the support for embodied practices , the presented workspace design and interaction techniques however may also be adapted for use in different situations that include the need for fluid externalization , reflection and co - located collaboration . Summary & Contributions 132 In the theme of fluid externalization , the presented interaction techniques for copying hybrid notes and informal artifact clustering can be applied to other situations that require informal user input from multiple people at the same time . For example , writing notes and attaching them to virtual workspaces or objects on interactive surfaces could also be used to annotate digital images with tags , to add notes to existing digital representations such as topographical maps , to input search terms to a collaborative information retrieval tool , or to collect individual ratings in a recommender system . Thereby , it represents an informal and fluent alternative to existing approaches such as on - screen keyboards , mobile devices or physical input controllers such as keyboards . As the handwriting on the notes can be recognized instantly , its contents may also be used to trigger commands to a system ( compare to image retrieval ) . Similarly , the described clustering techniques can be adapted for a variety of different tasks that require some kind of semi - formal structure . For example , a lightweight association of artifacts that are in spatial proximity may be used for more general sense - making activities such as for sorting photos , for clustering data from digital sources , for manually analyzing information artifacts , or for organizing document collections . Hence , it is rather flexible and represents an alternative to commonly known selection and grouping methods such as rubber banding , lasso selection and containers ( see Chapter 6 for a detailed investigation ) . Compared to these techniques , the presented approach is more informal and does not require the use of mode switches ( e . g . selection mode , manipulation mode ) or pre - determined spatial areas ( e . g . containers or folders ) . Further , the interaction technique of collecting unifies selection and collection within a single tangible object . Just by using the token , multiple mode switches and functions that are usually required are avoided – hence making interaction more fluid . Additionally , multiple collector tokens may be used at a time by different users which allows for collaborative selection and collection , which is not supported by traditional drag & drop techniques . AffinityTable also includes interaction techniques for the use in more general group activities that share the need for collaborative reflection , such as for analyzing spatial data , for making sense of information collections from different sources , or for browsing and navigating large spatial information spaces such as maps . For example , the author search technique allows visualizing ownership of digital objects on demand , thereby revealing responsibilities and consensus of group knowledge artifacts . This might be used for other situations as well , such as for reflecting on shared image or document collections . Interaction techniques for navigating a virtual workspace across multiple displays by zooming and panning such as using the focusing technique may further be applied to other situations where simultaneous explorations of overview and detail are desired . As the technique facilitates group awareness by directing the attention of multiple users upon one particular detailed workspace view , it can be used to facilitate convergent modes in group work situations . This may be desired in situations such as presentation , discussion and analysis of any visual material . Because a tangible object is used to trigger this functionality , no use of graphical user interface elements is required . Additionally , the tangible affordances of the focus token are a simple tool for guidance in the sense of embodied facilitation ( see section 3 . 2 . 1 ) . Eventually , the presented technical solutions regarding the overall workspace may also be applied for supporting more general co - located collaboration . The overall workspace design of AffinityTable includes different workspaces and territories that may be used for other group activities that combine loosely - coupled and closely - coupled collaboration styles . For example , individual workspaces on the table rim are adaptable for individual activities such as ideation or analysis , including other non - physical artifacts . The common workspace on the table is used to share and manipulate results of the individual activities as a connecting space between individual and collaborative work – thereby representing an instrument that facilitates coupling . In turn , the reflection display is a common reference for presentation , cooperative sense - making and discussion . Hence , the division of AffinityTable 133 territories within the virtual workspace follows a workflow based on individual work , shared manipulation and collaborative reflection . This may also be applied to other group activities that share one or more of these phases , such as collaborative design methods that include divergent and convergent modes . Further , awareness mechanisms such as the highlighting technique that supports embodied gestures across digital work surfaces can be applied not only to digital note artifacts , but also to artifacts such as sketches , images and other documents . Hence , it may be applied to other systems that also relate to the problems of group awareness when dealing with large spatial collections of information items . 4 . 5 . 3 Empirical Contributions The empirical contributions of this case study are two - fold . On the one hand , the initially conducted observational study contributes knowledge about the use of material artifacts within spatial design environments that may be useful for researchers working in similar domains . On the other hand , the conducted user study on the relation of digital interaction modalities and tradeoff decisions to embodied practices and workflows may also be useful for envisioning future design approaches . Regarding the observational study and analysis of embodied design practice for the case of affinity diagramming , many findings can be transferred to similar activities , such as the appropriation of work surfaces for specific tasks ( e . g . individual workspaces , shared references on walls ) , or the use of physical artifacts for creating and sharing information . It is argued that these findings resonate with similar hands - on group situations , like collaborative editing and annotation of documents and drawings . The findings hence extend existing knowledge toward an understanding of the role of embodiment in design practices . For example , Scott and Greenberg studied the natural practices of people collaborating with pen and paper on traditional tables ( Scott , 2005 ) . Based on a collaborative floor plan editing task , the researchers found three typical territories used within collaboration : personal , group , and storage territories . Similarly , the observation in this case study found personal , group and reflection territories . Although basically in line with the findings by Scott and Greenberg , the study extends this knowledge within the context of creative work . Just like related studies , the findings can be used to derive design implications and requirements . A user study of AffinityTable has been conducted to investigate the relation of digital functionality to embodied work practices . The findings of this investigation may be helpful for other researchers that have the goal to integrate digital technology in traditional work practices that are currently poorly supported by technology . The recommendations derived from the findings emphasize the need for more careful integration of technologies if work processes are to be preserved . This may not only be applied to design practice , but also to other work domains that heavily rely on physical material and spatial properties . For example , studies of control room practices such as air traffic control ( Sellen & Harper , 2003 ) emphasize the importance of embodied elements as an integral part of the workflow . The study at hand contributes to this , highlighting and creating awareness for such design strategies .

In this case , the design method “Brainsketching” was chosen as a complementary example to the previous case study . This case study seeks to demonstrate and exemplify the application of the proposed design methodology within a second , differently structured case . It is hence an additional contribution to RO2 : “Design and develop new digital tools and interaction techniques to preserve and augment specific collaborative design activities” . As with the research reported in the previous chapter , the second case study is based on the same design 5 Case Selection 136 methodology , including an observation and analysis of embodied practice and the design of a tradeoff - based novel hybrid digital tool . However , as some findings from the previous case study are also applied to this case , the observational study is limited to a qualitative analysis of traditional practices . For addressing RO3 , “Evaluate the developed tools as to assess the success of the proposed research” , a user study for examining the effects of the tool in situated use is reported . For the sake of readability and consistence , this chapter uses the same structure as the first case study , consisting of the parts analysis , design , evaluation and contribution . The research reported in this chapter was not exclusively done by the author of this thesis , but rather is the result of collaboration between multiple researchers . The individual responsibilities of these persons were : The author was responsible for the research design , process development , conceptual design , implementation , observations , user studies and dissemination ; Jochen Budzinski ( student researcher ) contributed to analysis , conceptual design , implementation , visual design and the user studies .

Affinity diagramming is – based on its use within early stages of the design process – a predominantly divergent activity that is mostly generative and explorative in nature ( see section 4 . 1 ) . It is consequently more similar to “brainstorming” methods that have the goal to achieve a common understanding of design problems and solutions ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ) . The convergent aspects of the method are concentrated to the activity of sorting notes into clusters , requiring interpretation and discussion of related design ideas . However , they are focused on organization rather than content - based reinterpretation or annotation . For a second study , it was hence desired that the investigated method may focus more extensively on convergent aspects to be suitable as a complementary extension to the previously developed approach . The goal of such activities is the refinement and selection of ideas to follow up upon in a more concentrated and focused effort . Further , it should conform to the same criteria as the case selected for the first case study . Based on the conducted literature review , the collaborative sketching method “Brainsketching” , “an idea generation technique that may be better suited for incorporating sketching in creative problem - 36 http : / / youtu . be / l0TGt5M4ovU IdeaVis 137 solving” ( Lugt , 2002b ) , was considered especially appropriate as it is primarily characterized by refinement and iteration – aspects that are less prominent in affinity diagramming . It is a representative of the more interpretational methods that fall into the category of “Composition” rather than “Exploration” ( see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) . The method is also attuned to the use in small design groups . However , it is situated later in the design process , after a common understanding of the design problem is already reached . Accordingly , explorative activities such as affinity diagramming may be practiced before Brainsketching sessions and may also be used as stimulus input to the method . The focus of the method described by Lugt is on the creation and refinement of ideas through the collaborative generation and annotation of visual sketches on paper or whiteboards ( Lugt , 2002b ) . It is based on the following procedure : 1 ) Individual externalization : ideas are visualized with visual free - form sketches and annotations 2 ) Sharing and annotating : ideas are shared and annotated using written comments without verbal discussion 3 ) Gathering and presenting : ideas are presented and discussed in the group 4 ) Rating : ideas are rated according their relevance and degree of innovation Figure 5 . 1 : Workflow , phases and iterations of the Brainsketching method : 1 ) creating , 2 ) sharing , 3 ) presenting , and 4 ) rating . These phases are conducted iteratively toward the goal of achieving saturation of a potential solution space . Doing so , participants begin by individually sketching ideas regarding a specific topic either on paper artifacts or on a whiteboard surface . The ideas are to be communicated using rough and imprecise visual depictions ( sketches ) and textual annotations . After individual generation , the group exchanges the sketches with other members , for example by passing around paper sheets or by physically rotating around a shared whiteboard . Participants may also freely choose from a collection of artifacts within a shared workspace – leading to a randomized distribution of ideas . The participants are then advised to reinterpret and comment on the shared ideas . This can be done using text annotations on the sketches or by adding sketches to the existing ideas . They are however also allowed to create new ideas based on the stimulus they received . Lugt ( 2002b ) explicitly recommends that participants use non - verbal communication for externalizing their comments in order to address production blocking ( see section 2 . 1 . 6 ) . After saturation , the accumulated ideas and annotations are discussed with the group using verbal communication and a display of created artifacts . This may be either done sequentially by all participants or may be controlled by a facilitator who directs the session . Presentation of ideas is meant to provide new stimuli and inspirations for additional rounds of externalization and sharing . Lugt recommends that this procedure may be carried out at least more than once ( Lugt , 2002b ) . Within following rounds of externalization , sharing and presenting , the ideas are iteratively selected and refined toward a common core set of seemingly valuable ideas . This iterative refinement is one of the most important differences to other collaborative design methods . Case Selection 138 Eventually , once the idea generation phase is being perceived as saturated or after a certain time limit or intervention by the facilitator , each sketch is rated by the participants using some range of values or scores . For example , differently colored sticky marker points may be attached to sketches to indicate relevance and innovation . The collected ratings may be used within the proceedings of a design process or for the documentation of results . Figure 5 . 1 depicts a schematic flow of the method and its distinct phases and iterations . The procedure of Brainsketching can be considered a specialization and well - structured variant of more loosely defined sketching activities . Although it can be practiced without a facilitator , the role of a session coordinator is helpful for controlling social dynamics , the session proceeding and phase transitions ( Lugt , 2002b ) . The facilitator then may take care of following responsibilities : Control phase durations and transitions Make sure that the shared goal is followed Allow individuals to work without being critiqued frequently Make participants feel appreciated and valued Stimulate contributions by involving passive participants Emphasize exploration and re - interpretation The method can be regarded as an extension to structured brainstorming methods such as Method 635 and Brainwriting pools ( see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) . Indeed , it shares the same rule - based and phase - oriented character of these methods . However , based on its emphasis on visual depiction and annotation rather than the use of words and sentences , it emphasizes the value of sketching methodology ( see section 2 . 2 . 2 ) by focusing on re - interpretation . Based on the importance of sketches , ( Lugt , 2002b ) proposes following general rules for practicing the method : Sketches for sharing should be depicted as a “talking sketch” which stimulates reinterpretation . This can be achieved with indeterminacy and openness to multiple solutions . Sketch depictions should however avoid too much vagueness to be useful ( Lugt , 2001 , p . 49 ) . Initial sketches should not include extensive details as the goal of the method is moving from general descriptions toward specific depictions of ideas ( Lugt , 2001 , p . 49 ) . The visibility and accessibility of sketches is crucial to enhance the availability of ideas to the members of the group . Hence , sketches should be available and accessible to the group at all times ( Lugt , 2001 , p . 50 ) . To highlight the characteristics of Brainsketching , Lugt conducted four empirical studies in which he compared the method with traditional brainstorming methodology ( Lugt , 2001 ) . Based on an analysis of multiple sessions with creative professionals , the author concludes that the method is especially suitable for idea refinement and less for idea differentiation . Using quantitative measures , the author could prove that participants built upon their own ideas to a high extent , but built upon the ideas of others to a more limited extent . These issues relate to the phenomenon of early fixation as discussed in the analysis of this thesis ( see section 2 . 1 . 5 ) . According to the author , especially untrained individuals tend to stay fixed on early ideas and also on their own ideas , which limits the degree of reinterpretation . Based on the experiences of these experiments , Lugt hence proposed following additional guidelines and rules to make such idea generation meetings more productive for novice designers : IdeaVis 139 An initial warming - up activity should be conducted before the productive part of the session . Participants should feel comfortable in expressing their ideas visually and with textual annotations ( Lugt , 2002b , p . 53 ) . This activity explicitly addresses evaluation apprehension ( see section 2 . 1 . 6 ) . Interpretation and exploration of ideas is to be emphasized over the evaluation of ideas . As participants tend to prematurely judge the value of an idea based on its visual depiction , they should rather freely imagine consequences of suggestions based on these ideas ( Lugt , 2002b , p . 53 ) . Participants should be invited to create new ideas rather than adding features to an earlier sketch . This will lessen the amount of duplicate sketches and hence cares for more differentiation ( Lugt , 2002b , p . 53 ) . Table 5 . 1 : Approaches for improving the productivity of Brainsketching sessions . Issue Production Blocking Evaluation Apprehension Free Riding Fixation Effects Method Externalizing ideas should be possible anytime Annotations instead of verbal commentary allow for reducing identification Each participant should have the chance for explaining ideas Warm - up activities Re - interpretation activities Tool Externalizing material should be easily accessible Provide simple tools for rapid externalization Reduce identification by providing identical stroke color Provide individual workspaces for private work Allow for identification on demand only Make individual contributions visible on demand Make shared artifacts visible and accessible to the group Facilitator Allow for individual work Make participants feel comfortable and appreciated Stimulate contributions by involving passive participants Invite production of new ideas Emphasize exploration or re - interpretation of selected ideas While Lugt does not specifically address the use of certain materials and tools for practicing Brainsketching , following materials that are frequently recommended for similar techniques ( Beyer & Holtzblatt , 1997 ; Greenberg et al . , 2012 ; Herring , Jones , et al . , 2009 ; Hilliges et al . , 2007 ; Snyder , 2003 ; Warr & O’Neill , 2005 ) are sought to be effective for supporting the basic workflow : Use accessible artifacts that can be easily handled ( limit production blocking ) Provide a large display surface that makes ideas visible and accessible to all participants Provide individual and shared workspaces ( avoid evaluation apprehension ) Avoid distractions to allow all participants to focus on the primary task Use simple tools such as pen & paper for externalization ( limit production blocking ) Reduce identification of individuals by providing only one stroke color ( limit evaluation apprehension ) Allow for identification of individual contributions on demand ( avoid free riding ) Table 5 . 1 summarizes approaches for improving the productivity of the Brainsketching method . The effectiveness is hence generally determined by the rules of the method , the employed tools and the Analysis 140 influence of a creative facilitator . Yet , the quality of a group activity is of course also dependent on the design knowledge , ability and motivation of the participants . The Brainsketching method is – similar to affinity diagramming – considered to be most effectively practiced using lo - tech material . Lugt even explicitly argues that desktop - based digital systems are counterproductive for use in such idea generation meetings because they obstruct access to the group’s external memory : “Computer - supported Idea generation techniques like ' group decision rooms ' , obstruct access to the remote areas of the group ' s external memory . Consequently , the use of these computer systems leads to poorly integrated idea generation . ” ( Lugt , 2001 ) . The author grounds this argument with the fact that “computers restrict the communication lines available” ( Lugt , 2001 , p . 46 ) , meaning the lack of support for gesturing and verbal communication that is important when interacting with shared visual context . Further arguments are the lack of indeterminacy yielded by formal interaction modalities of computer systems that do not match the fluency of material artifacts . However , considering the rapid evolution of technologies , these arguments have to be re - evaluated today . Researches have made significant progress in supporting co - located sketching activities with digital systems . For example , digital infrastructures such as i - LAND ( Streitz et al . , 1999 ) or TEAM STORM ( Hailpern et al . , 2007 ) allow the creation and sharing of digital sketches across multiple devices and displays ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) . TEAM STORM even demonstrates an interaction model for working with multiple ideas in parallel , something that is hard to achieve using the limited flexibility of digital display space . Recent tools such as GAMBIT ( Sangiorgi et al . , 2012 ) advance the same approach toward ubiquitous sketching on different platforms such as tablets and smartphones . Yet , these systems use entirely digital interaction modalities such as digital pen input on tablet devices or on large interactive whiteboards . Further , display transfer techniques are necessary for sharing ideas which may hamper the flow in dynamic group sessions . Accordingly , they do limit the application of the above described characteristics of the Brainsketching method . System such as the Nice Discussion Room ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) are adding more physical interaction through integration of paper artifacts with large displays . However , they lack support for the iterative and re - interpretative nature of collaborative sketching . Further limitations of existing approaches will be reviewed later in this chapter ( see section 5 . 5 . 1 ) . One may summarize that Brainsketching is an adequate method to be used for a second case study and conforms with the criteria as it : 1 ) has a well - defined structured workflow that can be frequently found within the domain of design , 2 ) is related to other methods and hence cares for appropriation , 3 ) is used within small face - to - face groups , 4 ) includes divergent and convergent characteristics of creativity , 5 ) relies on embodied aspects such as physical artifacts and spatial environments , and 6 ) is poorly supported by digital tools . 5 . 2 Analysis As with the first case study , this investigation is approached with an initial empirical analysis of the embodied characteristics of situated Brainsketching sessions . This analysis is again guided by a tradeoff - driven design methodology ( see section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . The goal of the study is to understand the interplay between the method , social factors and material and spatial properties of the design environment in situated use . While a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted in the first case study , this case study focuses on qualitative data from observations and co - design workshops conducted with professional creative facilitators . IdeaVis 141 5 . 2 . 1 Observation In order to learn more about the actual practice of collaborative sketching , an observation of multiple Brainsketching sessions was conducted . As in the first case study , the observation was embedded into the same simulated design process of a six - month interaction design course on the local university campus ( see section 4 . 2 . 1 ) . The Brainsketching session was scheduled a week after a previously conducted affinity diagramming session . Hence , participants already explored the problem space and have also previously developed first design solutions . Overall , four groups of graduate students in HCI ( N = 15 , 4 - 6 each ) were observed . Prior to the sessions , a detailed introduction to the design method , the desired results and guidance on approaching design solutions by sketching was given by the researchers . The students then carried out the design technique independently . However , two researchers were on site and carefully facilitated the proceeding and timing of the particular phases of the method . Participants were given recommended material and tools such as paper sheets and different pens . For rating the ideas , small adhesive dots were supplied that could be added to the sketches . The work environment was based on a large horizontal surface ( table ) and a large vertical surface ( pinboard ) ( see Figure 5 . 2 ) . The sessions lasted between 1 . 5 and 2 hours . Two researchers collected material in the form of video recordings , photos and structured observation notes . Further , the produced design material was collected and documented after the sessions . Figure 5 . 3 exemplifies the resulting artifacts of one of the sessions . Figure 5 . 2 : Setting of the observational study . Figure 5 . 3 : Resulting artifacts of a Brainsketching session . Sketch with annotation history ( left ) and collage of results ( right ) . The qualitative analysis was again guided by the thesis framework with the themes Externalization , Reflection , Collaboration and Process . Thereby , the social , bodily and environmental behavior of participants was in focus . Within Externalization , embodied interactions with paper artifacts were characterized and in Reflection , the visual attention of participants regarding their workspaces was Analysis 142 observed . Interactions between participants such as communication and gesturing were identified within Collaboration . For investigating the theme of Process , the dynamics of the method such as iterations and transitions between the distinct phases were analyzed . 5 . 2 . 2 Workshops with Creative Facilitators As an immediate result of the observation it became apparent that facilitating such sessions is not straightforward and that special skills and practices are required to effectively coordinate and direct the proceedings of creative group work . Hence , a further goal of the analysis was to consult professional creative facilitators for examining their work practices and strategies . The purpose of this was also to inform the design of a potential digital solution with expert knowledge . By incorporating the expertise of experienced professionals into the design process , a more adequate solution might be developed . Although interviews would give insight into the work practices of creative facilitators , it was decided that experiences regarding such complex and dynamic situations would best be exchanged through a series of participatory workshops . Therefore , two workshops with a trained professional facilitator and his team were conducted after the initial observational study . The consulted professionals are highly trained and experienced in conducting creativity workshops within the innovation lab of the German automotive manufacturer Daimler AG ( Customer Research Center ) . With over six years of professional experience in directing large - scale creativity workshops with a multitude of different design methods and techniques , the leading facilitator was able to share valuable knowledge regarding creative group processes . The workshops were conducted on two days . On the first day , four local researchers took part in a full - day creativity workshop on - site at Daimler . On the second day , the lead facilitator and one of his colleagues visited the local lab on campus for a half - day co - design workshop . Figure 5 . 4 : Setting and materials used within the full - day creativity workshop at the Daimler Customer Research Center . The first workshop had the goal to actually experience the work of facilitators by actively participating in a professionally directed workshop . Beside the researchers , about 25 people took part in this workshop . Participants were graduate students mostly with a background in Product Design and Creative Direction . Therefore , multiple groups of about 5 - 7 individuals were split up and given individual design tasks . Through a series of presentations about the design domain , Personas , creativity techniques and design methods directed by multiple cooperating facilitators , novel concepts for the interior and exterior design of a new car model were developed . Figure 5 . 4 gives some impressions on the setting employed within this workshop . Various types of lo - tech media such as IdeaVis 143 pinboards , whiteboards , sticky notes , different paper sizes ( from A0 to A5 ) as well as markers and pens were employed , depending on the individual requirements of the creativity methods . The physical environment consisted of a very large room ( construction hall ) with high ceiling , multiple large tables and abundant display space in the form of whiteboards and movable walls . Further , different forms of stimulus inputs such as Personas , images , mood boards and construction drawings were employed . Material such as Personas were also introduced and discussed by the facilitators to initiate brainstorming sessions . The large room further provided space for the current car model ( see Figure 5 . 4 : Setting and materials used within the full - day creativity workshop at the Daimler Customer Research Center . , right ) , so participants could actually experience and simulate their ideas within a real car . The facilitators did interact with the participants verbally but also by placing physical artifacts into the focus of the group . The workshop concluded with a discussion of the results and with mutual exchange regarding the individual experiences made while observing the facilitation . The workshop was not recorded with video cameras . However , digital images and summaries of the workshop results were supplied by Daimler . The second workshop was conducted in the local lab on campus in order to investigate potential use of technology and design concepts for augmenting the Brainsketching process . Participants were two local researchers and two professional facilitators from Daimler . The workshop was structured into an initial presentation and discussion of the Brainsketching method and multiple co - design phases inspired by technology probes . As the method was not familiar to the facilitators , participants discussed commonalities and differences to other methods . Limitations and benefits of the method were discussed along with potential research issues . Thereafter , an introduction to different technology probes was given by one of the researchers . Among the probes were technologies such as digital pen & paper , various interactive displays and visualizations , tangible objects , visual markers as well as a more general smart room infrastructure . During the discussion of the technology probes , the facilitators had the chance to try out different functionalities and to inquire technical information . As a result , a series of rough design concepts and sketches emerged that were documented by one observing researcher . To achieve a natural and non - committal situation , the use of audio or video recording was avoided . 5 . 2 . 3 Results and Discussion In the following , the results of the observational study and the workshops with creative facilitators are discussed and synthesized within the thesis framework . Because some of the identified issues are in line with results from the previous case study investigation , special emphasis is put on the specifics of the Brainsketching method and the need of facilitators . Concerning interactions within the theme of Externalization , features were identified that describe the individual actions within ideation and sharing of sketches . Similar as within the ideation phase of affinity diagramming participants utilized individual workspaces on the table for working on their sketches ( see Figure 5 . 5 ) . However , the workspaces were much closer and less isolated from the shared workspace which emerged in the center of the table . Further , no pre - sorting activities were observed as the ideation phase often ended with the transfer of sketches immediately after they were produced . During ideation , participants rarely communicated verbally , however , deictic gestures such as handling paper to other individuals or inside the proximity of specific persons in the group were observed . Externalization itself was rather fluent and dynamic with rapid production of a large number of sketches on different paper sheets . During presentation , deictic references were frequently used to highlighting areas of a sketch or for referencing multiple related sketches . Hence , bodily interactions also seem to form a part of externalizing ideas . Asked for the specific characteristics of the ideation phase , facilitators stated that they try to make participants feel comfortable and Analysis 144 undisturbed while externalizing and thus explicitly avoid interactions such as talking to the group as a whole . Rather they seek to stimulate contributions by making it as easy as possible with adequate materials and tools . This is realized by providing an abundance of paper sheets and pens . Having ample material available may contribute to the divergence of the activity , resulting in more ideas produced . Further , facilitators might interact with individuals when they notice that they tend to fix on one idea for a longer amount of time or when the amount of detail depicted on a sketch seems too extensive . This may ensure that more rough ideas are being produced rather than less , but more detailed ideas . Figure 5 . 5 : Use of personal workspaces for individual ideation activities . Within the theme of Reflection , the spatial and environmental aspects of the design situation were analyzed . This concerned the territories that emerged during the activity . Beside the individual areas used for ideation , the most important workspace emerged as the shared area in the center of the table . Participants used this place for non - verbally exchanging their ideas with gestures such as skipping , grabbing and dragging . During reflection phases , participants were browsing and sorting through available sketches in order to find inspiration or to look for comments and annotations . Thereby , stacks and piles of paper sheets were utilized – resulting in rather messy and dynamic collections . The available space on the table hence was utilized extensively to spread out overlapping sketches . However , even with the large tables supplied , overlapping items were quite common . Occasionally , sketches were offloaded to other areas in the proximity , such as chairs or were even temporally pinned to a whiteboard . Presentation and discussion of ideas was mostly done using the paper artifacts directly on the table . Because of legibility of the paper sketches from only one angle at the table , participants often altered their positions and gathered around a particular sketch . However , participants that were more distant such as on the opposite side of the table suffered a lack of accessibility and visibility . During the activity of presenting , the artifacts were also frequently moved and rotated to care for better visibility for all members of the group . The vertical surfaces however were rarely used as participants avoided the transfer of artifacts . This may be due to the small size and detailed pen strokes of the sketches that are hard to read from a distance . Yet , at the end of the sessions , the best rated artifacts were pinned to the whiteboard as a form of selection and documentation ( see Figure 5 . 3 ) . Facilitators stated that they are in constant reflection in order to search for good ideas and to compare ideas for recognizing potential within the group work . For doing so , they browse and scan the produced sketches while at the same time trying to gain awareness of the process and content . Accordingly , the available means of reflection are not only important for the participants but are integral to the work of facilitators . Concerning Collaboration , cooperation and coordination was mainly concentrated within the shared workspace on the table . Similar to the activities that characterized the affinity diagramming method , fluent and quick interactions such as grabbing and skipping gestures or pointing with fingers and IdeaVis 145 arms were evident during discussion and presentation . Compared to the affinity diagramming method , different roles emerged . As the shared workspace on the table was mostly visible and accessible to all participants , turn - taking was less dominant due to a more equal access on the table compared to a vertical work surface . Mutual blocking rarely occurred when participants were gathering around a sketch . This may be due to the larger size of the design artifacts that are better accessible than the small sticky notes in affinity diagramming . Hence , gatekeeping by dominant personalities is found to be a less critical issue . The table can be considered as a shared repository in which participant added and retrieved design knowledge . Awareness of manipulations regarding the shared paper sheets in the repository was supported by visible gestures such as moving and grasping that are easily perceived from the peripheral vision of individual participants . However , the piles of overlapping paper also caused issues when participants were searching for a particular sketch during discussion or presentation . Due to the limited space on the table for spreading out the ideas , browsing and shifting paper was frequently accompanied with physical restrictions – possibly leading to free riding . Awareness over collaborative activities is however not only important for the participants , but also for the facilitators . As the general direction a group pursues not only also communicated through the content of paper sketches , facilitators need to pay careful attention to the verbal communication during discussion . They might also intervene within these phases by supporting adding arguments to a particular idea or by emphasizing a seemingly fruitful group direction . Facilitators however see themselves as partners rather than critics . This is important as negative critique may contribute to increased evaluation apprehension among the designers . Similarly , during rating activities , an anonymous way of expressing support is desired . Accordingly , participants preferred the use of their rating markers within their immediate individual workspace rather than at the center of the table , which is more visible to the group . Regarding the Process of the Brainsketching method , participants mostly kept to the general proceeding and did not feel the need to change the workflow during the session . Because individual reflection of the sketches within the repository can be done in parallel with the individual ideation of other designers , synchronizing individual and group work is less of an issue . This is in contrast to affinity diagramming , where individuals might have to wait for their turn before commenting or presenting artifacts . The distributed way of communicating feedback through annotations can hence be considered effectively for limiting production blocking . Rapid changes between reflection and action were observed during the first two phases . This is in line with the characteristics of affinity diagramming , where externalization and reflection were tightly coupled . Presentation phases were again evident as a link between individual work and group work . Although the process and proceeding of the method was mostly clear and understood by the participants , issues emerged in later stages when the amount of produced artifact grew larger . This may be due to the increased complexity in convergence for follow - up activities such as additional phases of ideation . Here , a facilitator may heavily influence the productivity of the overall session as he may select and choose from the created design ideas – emphasizing convergence toward a clear goal . For doing so however , the facilitator needs to be aware of all possible paths than are available to the group based on the created content . Hence , awareness of the process and content is vital for the facilitator’s understanding of the process . This is especially crucial considering the amount of sketches and overlapping artifacts that hamper overview , visibility and accessibility . The facilitators thereby also have to reveal important source ideas between possibly multiple iterations , duplicate ideas and annotations . This also concerns the problem of identifying the author of a sketch , which might also be quite important for discussing an idea in detail . As the paper sheets end up being randomly distributed within the shared workspace , it is not always easy to identify the “owner” of a specific idea . The facilitators also emphasized a further issue that is not directly related to the proceeding of the method itself , rather regarding their follow - up activities such as documentation and analysis after Design 146 the sessions . As the main goal of the design method is to generate ideas for reuse as stimulus within a larger design process , documentation is crucial to the work of facilitators . Accordingly , they spend significant efforts in analyzing and documenting the results of the session with digital cameras for later reuse . Table 5 . 2 summarizes the findings from the analysis concerning the most beneficial properties of embodied practice and potential limitations . Table 5 . 2 : Benefits and limitations of embodied Brainsketching practice . Benefits Limitations Externalization The abundant availability of material artifacts is effective for divergence in individual ideation Externalization might be hampered by fixation and too much focus on details Reflection Spatial positioning and juxtaposition of artifacts is handled effectively though manual interaction The table is not suitable as reflection space , however transfer of artifacts to a vertical surface limits their visibility and accessibility Collaboration Hands - on characteristics of collaborative actions such as grabbing and gesturing facilitate group awareness Piles of overlapping artifacts hamper presentation and discussion Process Physical artifacts and individual workspaces facilitate parallel activities and coupling The overall workflow is harmed by limited overview and awareness over the created design ideas which is necessary for controlling convergence 5 . 3 Design The results of the presented analysis are used as input to the actual design process that strives toward a unification of benefits of embodied practice with technological possibilities . Therefore , as with the previous case study , explicit tradeoff decisions based on the proposed design methodology ( see 3 . 2 . 2 ) were devised . The tradeoff decisions were then implemented within a prototype design tool called IdeaVis . In the following , the process and the result of these efforts are described . Eventually , some details on the implementation of the system are briefly summarized . 5 . 3 . 1 Tradeoff Decisions As with the first case study , knowledge from the observational study , from the workshops with the facilitators and from the overall analysis of the work domain and established guidelines ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 ) was synthesized for devising tradeoff decisions . Again , the goal was to balance the effective characteristics of embodied practice with potential improvements with application of technology . Accordingly , technology may be applied where characteristics such as fluency , visibility , awareness , accessibility and functionality or storage are limited ( see section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . In line with previous investigations ( see Chapter 4 ) , the traditional paper - based practices for ideation , externalization and sharing of ideas were found to have no negative effects on the workflow and productivity of the design session . In contrast , the use of technology such as pen tablets or interactive displays might even hamper the fluency of externalization and the ease of artifact handling in individual and shared territories . Although many other researchers employ pen tablets for externalization ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) , it is argued here that these technologies do not yield significant benefits for improving rapid and fluent externalization . This is mainly due to two reasons . Firstly , digital interfaces and GUIs allow specifying many details such as stroke color and thickness that may IdeaVis 147 contribute to a refinement of individual sketches toward perfection , which is not the focus of this design method ( see section 5 . 1 ) . Secondly , use of digital display space makes the exchange of artifacts less fluent because transfer techniques for moving digital artifacts between devices and / or shared displays require additional effort . The natural and effortless exchange of paper sheets within the shared workspace on the table is hence considered worth preserving . Accordingly , it was decided to strive for preserving the material paper - based practice for ideation and sharing activities ( T1 ) . The analysis further revealed that participants had complications with presenting and discussing artifacts in the group based on limitations in shared accessibility and visibility of sketches on the table . This was partly due to the orientation of the artifacts on the table and varying perspectives of participants . Further , the use of a vertical surface that would offer better visibility was avoided due to the constraints in accessibility that would result from this transfer . Digital technology such as large displays might hence be used for augmenting visibility in a complementary way during presentation purposes . This could possibly be achieved with digital replication and magnification of the sketched ideas on large screens or projections . Accordingly , a second tradeoff was devised that aims for supporting improved visibility and accessibility of artifacts ( T2 ) . Eventually , regarding the process of the method , it was found that facilitators may have the most positive impact on the productivity of the session . Accordingly , they should be supported by augmenting their influence on the group’s awareness and attention . As facilitators were most challenged with the task of gaining overview and awareness of the process and contents , technology might be used effectively for analyzing and visualizing the group’s activities . For example , an interactive visualization of individual contributions , the design process and history is capable of augmenting both awareness and communication abilities of the facilitator ( T3 ) . To summarize , following tradeoffs were derived as a result of the previous investigations : • T1 : preserve individual ideation and reflection with physical artifacts • T2 : support increased visibility and awareness of shared artifacts • T3 : augment the awareness and communication abilities of facilitators Figure 5 . 6 : Tradeoff decisions along the reality vs . power continuum . For the design process , the three tradeoff decisions were classified along a reality vs . power continuum ( see Figure 5 . 6 ) . As T1 strives towards preserving reality as closely as possible , it does not add a lot of functionality ( power ) to the interface and is hence positioned toward the extreme of reality which indicates its importance for preserving qualities of embodied practices . T2 seeks to support presentation and discussion with digital replications by still preserving the basic characteristics and is hence situated in - between reality and power . T3 significantly deviates from reality by augmenting the process with entirely digital functionalities such as visualizations or histories . For the design of a prototype tool , reality is given priority and power is added when needed . Consequently , the system workspace and interaction techniques were iteratively designed from T1 to T3 along the reality p o w e r T2 T1 T3 Design 148 spectrum towards power . This way , the power of the system could be increased gradually by still ensuring that the digital functionality is complementary with the goal to both preserve and augment traditional workflows . 5 . 3 . 2 Workspace Design The first step toward a design proposal for a prototype system for supporting the design method was the development of a hybrid workspace design . Based on an iterative idea generation process , it was decided that the workspace would be the foundation to preserving many aspects of the original method such as material ideation and fluent collaboration . With the aim of preserving embodied practices , it was hence decided to keep a traditional non - interactive table as main workspace and paper sheets as work material ( see Figure 5 . 7 ) . This is in contrast to many other systems that use augmented paper directly on interactive displays ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) . However , as a prerequisite for enabling additional functionalities within later tradeoffs , digital pen & paper is employed . This technology allows users to work with regular paper while multiple digital pens recognize strokes and send them digitally to a computer via a wireless Bluetooth connection . Only one stroke color is provided for reducing individual identification to the participants . Further , optional functionality is available to the group via paper interface buttons . There are accessible to users via interactive areas printed on the paper . By tapping these areas on the paper with a digital pen , digital functionality is triggered . This hybrid workspace allows preserving the traditional workflow and the quality of paper artifacts ( T1 ) while at the same time enabling digital representations and functionality . For supporting presentation and discussion in the group ( T2 ) , a large high - resolution non - interactive display was added for displaying digital representations of the sketches on demand ( see Figure 5 . 7 , left ) . It is mounted in close proximity to the table , just like a real pin - board would be in traditional settings . Furthermore , an additional interactive display is used to display interactive and analytic visualizations to the facilitator ( T3 ) ( see Figure 5 . 7 , right ) . A facilitator may move freely between the group workspace and the visualization display for switching between directing the session and analyzing the proceeding via the facilitator display . The visualization on this second display thereby utilizes the data received from the digital pens to provide an analytic and content - based view onto the design process ( see section 5 . 3 . 3 ) . Additionally , a laser printer is available to the group and the facilitator for printing and copying paper sheets . This can be done using the paper interface on the individual paper sheets on the table or via the visualization interface of the facilitator . Figure 5 . 7 : The IdeaVis workspace is based on digital pen & paper , a printer , a group display and a facilitator display ( sketch by Jochen Budzinski ) , final system design ( right ) . IdeaVis 149 5 . 3 . 3 Interaction and Visualization Techniques Within a second step , interaction techniques and visualizations were designed for supporting the basic tasks and workflow of the design method . Based on the workspace setting , design ideas were developed in an iterative process . The main concerns were how interaction and visualization concepts may be applied to augment awareness and accessibility of design artifacts ( T2 , T3 ) . In the following , only the final interaction concepts that were eventually implemented and evaluated are described and discussed . For more details on the design process and a variety of alternative ideas and concepts , see ( Budzinski , 2012 ) . The resulting interaction techniques can be divided into the categories of paper - based interaction techniques and design activity visualizations . Paper - based Interaction Techniques Within the category of paper - based interaction techniques , IdeaVis provides functionalities that can be triggered through the use of interactive buttons printed on the paper . Therefore , the digital paper was augmented with three interactive regions . The labeled and color coded regions allow for printing copies of a sketch , for highlighting a sketch on the large group display , and for rating ideas . Figure 5 . 8 : Printing copies of a sketch using the paper interface . By tapping the red area on the paper labeled “print” , an identical copy of the particular sketch is produced by the printer ( see Figure 5 . 8 ) . Because the paper itself lacks instant feedback , a visual notification on the large group display shows the status of the printer queue to inform users if their actions were successful . The intention behind this functionality is that duplicating sketches allows the distribution of ideas to multiple other persons without the need to pass on the original . Thereby , the interaction technique aims toward fostering comments via annotation and toward reducing evaluation apprehension issues . Modification or extension of ideas now does no longer affect the original sketch , which might make participants more comfortable in commenting on the original paper sheets of others – something that is not reversibly using traditional materials . Using the printing functionality , users may print a new copy if they are not satisfied with their comments or annotations . However , when misused , this functionality might also lead to fixation as the need for re - drawing a sketch – which is avoided with the technique – also supports re - interpretation . With this additional and entirely option functionality , a simple and fluent way of forking ideas is added to the method . Because the idea may be edited or annotated by multiple designers at the same time , this concept also allows for more loosely coupled collaboration strategies . Overall , the functionality contributes to the second tradeoff T2 as it makes the design artifacts more accessible to the group and the facilitator . Design 150 Figure 5 . 9 : Highlighting a sketch on the group display using the paper interface . Using a second interactive region labeled “highlight” , users may display a digital representation of the paper sketch on the large group display . After tapping the paper button , the sketch is added to the display within a sequential grid layout ( see Figure 5 . 9 , left ) . Sequential thereby means that sketches that are added to the display appear within rows and columns from top left to bottom right . The layout was chosen to make sure that all sketches sent to the display are visible and do not overlap . This way , the display offers enough space for up to thirty sketches . Although technically a limitation , this was a conscious decision as to keep a minimum display size and persistent position of sketches on the display . This way , users may verbally reference highlighted sketches based on their position within the grid ( e . g . top row , second column ) . As the sketches are added in sequential order , the display also represents a time - based history of the session , allowing users to reflect on earlier ideas that were the focus of a presentation or discussion . Eventually , if more than thirty sketches are added to the display , each cell of the grid is filled with piles that automatically cycle through all sketches based on a timed animation . Figure 5 . 10 : Rating ideas using a gesture template region on the interactive paper . Using the same button , users can focus a sketch on the group display . Once the sketch is added to the display , it is enlarged to a full - size representation covering the whole display ( see Figure 5 . 9 , right ) . The transition between the overview state and the focus state is smoothly animated to make these switches of attention less obtrusive . Pressing the paper button again , restores the overview . Hence , users may rapidly switch between focusing multiple related sketches and reflecting upon the history of the session using the paper interface only . The view of the sketch on the display is live , which means that manipulations made on the paper are instantly transferred to the digital representation . While presenting , users may thus further use the pen to mark regions in the sketch . This way , the technique also allows for deictic references across the paper sheets and the display . By highlighting ideas , users implicitly select which ideas are visible for presentation and discussion , thereby limiting the number of artifacts in focus . Accordingly , the functionality also contributes the IdeaVis 151 goal of making artifacts more visible and accessible ( T2 ) . The large view of the sketch facilitates an immersive shared representation that may increase group awareness and may also be helpful for facilitators to involve participants . Eventually , a third interactive region on the paper is dedicated for the activity of rating ideas . Users may rate ideas by drawing small circles in a gesture template area on the paper sheet . Each circle drawn in this area indicates support for this particular idea ( see Figure 5 . 10 , left ) . The number of circles indicates a numerical scale that is instantly displayed on all digital representations of the sketch . Therefore , ideas may be rated individually by passing around the paper in the group , while the combined ratings are shown on the group display . This functionality hence also contributes to the goal of increasing group awareness ( T2 ) and at the same time moderates evaluation apprehension issues because the rating can be done privately on paper in a protected workspace . Design Activity Visualizations Some of the paper - based interaction techniques already contribute to the goal of improving awareness and accessibility . From the analysis however , it was found that facilitators may benefit from an overview of the process , the ideas created and the re - interpretations made ( T3 ) . Therefore , a custom mechanism was developed that utilizes the stroke data retrieved from the digital pens to keep track of all changes made on the paper over time and their relation to their authors or annotators . Based on the identification data of different pens and different paper sheets , a trajectory ( time - ordered set of states within a dynamical system ) of idea progression ( annotation ) and forking ( copying ) as well as original authors or modifiers and annotators ( pen identification ) is created within the IdeaVis system ( see section 5 . 3 . 4 ) . The data provided by the versioning trajectory was then used for the design of an interactive visualization for the facilitator display . Because extensive sketching sessions result in a large number of ideas and very deep trajectories , a visualization technique was desired that conveys all produced sketches and links such as copies and annotations within one comprehensible , time - based overview . At the same time , the visualization should allow browsing and focusing on specific parts of the session or even on individual sketches . After an exploration and investigation of many different visualization variants such as timelines , clusters , treemaps or hierarchies , it was decided that a hyperbolic tree visualization ( Lamping , Rao , & Pirolli , 1995 ) would be most adequate . This visualization technique supports the interactive exploration of large hierarchies within a circular fisheye view . The circular view of the tree can be navigated by moving a part of it toward the center for enlarging the respective part of the tree structure while keeping the rest of the tree visible in a scaled down representation that depends on the distance toward the center . Hence , the immediate surroundings of focused nodes are kept visible while unrelated nodes are scaled down but are still in reach . The basic concept of the visualization was adapted for the IdeaVis system , using sketches as nodes ( see Figure 5 . 11 ) . Accordingly , sketches that are produced during the session are dynamically added to the tree in clockwise direction around a central node ( see Figure 5 . 11 , a ) . The central node serves as a hub , displaying statistical information such as the number of unique ideas , the number of pens and a link counter . The link counter is a measure of the degree of re - interpretation that is evident based on the created content . Once links are created in the trajectory , child nodes are dynamically added to the tree ( see Figure 5 . 11 , b ) which makes it grow over time . Color coding is used around the border of the sketches to indicate whether a sketch is an original , an annotation or a copy ( see Figure 5 . 11 , c ) . Sketches that are currently being manipulated by the participants of the session are highlighted with a circular glow that fades over time ( see Figure 5 . 11 , d ) . This awareness mechanism allows facilitators to detect the current focus of the group’s activity . Overall , the visualization conveys a history of the session ( clockwise arrangement ) , the number of ideas produced ( size of the tree ) , the degree of re - interpretation ( depth of the tree ) , fixation ( uneven distribution of nodes ) and the current activity of the group Design 152 ( highlighting ) at a glance . Thus , it conveys content - based information to the facilitator that goes well beyond a timeline session history . Further , the interactive navigation within the focus & context visualization can be used for analyzing the contents of the session in more detail . The facilitator may interact with the visualization with touch gestures for dragging and zooming . By dragging a part of the tree to the center of the display , the respective nodes are enlarged for a more detailed view . Zooming gestures can be used to focus on a specific node in detail ( tap gesture ) or to examine a region of the tree ( pinching gesture ) . Just like on the group display , each node is a live view of the paper sketch , instantly displaying the stream of strokes from all digital pens and the rating scale if available . Figure 5 . 11 : An interactive hyperbolic tree visualization conveys the recorded data for exploration by the session facilitator . Each sketch in the tree further has a toolbox of buttons ( see Figure 5 . 11 , c ) which enables additional functionalities for the facilitator . For being able to identify authors and annotators of ideas , colored labels were attached to each pen . The color coding corresponds to the identification data of the pens in the system . Hence , the system is able to reveal identification data to the facilitator on demand . By pressing the “Identify” button ( see Figure 5 . 11 , bottom ) , a dropdown item shows all colors ( i . e . authors ) that contributed to the particular sketch in the order of occurrence . Pressing a colored button highlights strokes within the sketch with that color for visualizing which part of the sketch was created by that particular author . This way , the facilitator has awareness of individual contributions and may use this knowledge for directing group activities ( e . g . stimulate passive participants ) . This way , he is also able to distinguish between the originator of an idea and annotators , which would be impossible by looking at the paper sheets only . The buttons “Print a Copy” and “Show on Display” ( see Figure 5 . 11 , bottom ) are equivalent to the functionality of the paper interface for printing and presenting sketches . The facilitator may use this functionality for manipulating the group’s activity either by highlighting selected sketches on the large display for discussion , or for IdeaVis 153 printing a selection of sketches for systematic physical placement into the group . The facilitator may also use his own pen to write questions on the printout to further emphasize specific aspects worth exploring . Eventually , a “Combine” button ( see Figure 5 . 11 , bottom ) allows for merging different sketches from the tree onto one paper sheet . By pressing the button , the sketch is sent to a clipboard that is displayed within a drawer on the left side of the interface ( see Figure 5 . 12 ) . Sketches sent to the clipboard are scaled down and arranged within a grid on a single virtual paper sheet that can be printed from within the clipboard view . By enabling the facilitator to collect related ideas , he may control the group’s activity toward convergence . Figure 5 . 12 : A clipboard allows combining sketches . The view can be printed on paper for distribution to the group . To summarize and conclude the system presentation , Table 5 . 3 depicts the potential benefits of the discussed interaction techniques , system features and corresponding tradeoff decisions within the themes of the thesis framework . Table 5 . 3 : System features of IdeaVis and their potential benefits in relation to the themes of the thesis framework . Externalization Reflection Collaboration Process Use of physical paper and traditional workspaces preserves workflow ( T1 ) Sketches can be printed for avoiding the annotation of original sketches ( T2 ) The group display provides a shared reference to all participants and increases visibility ( T2 ) Focusing augments reflection activities with increased visibility ( T2 ) Traditional paper material preserves fluent and dynamic idea exchange ( T1 ) The group display augments presentation and browsing during discussion ( T2 ) A design activity visualization conveys content - based information to the facilitator ( T3 ) Tools such as combining , printing and highlighting augment communication abilities of the facilitator ( T3 ) 5 . 3 . 4 Implementation IdeaVis has been implemented and set up in a collaborative effort within the local lab on campus . In the following , the fundamental aspects of the implementation are briefly summarized . Further details Design 154 regarding the implementation and technical infrastructure are provided within a technical report ( Budzinski , 2012 ) . Figure 5 . 13 : Technical workspace architecture of the IdeaVis system . The main components of the design tool are a distributed workspace based on digital pen & paper and two large high - resolution displays . These work surfaces and materials are integrated with a networked client - server solution that receives digital pen data and controls the interface on both displays . Figure 5 . 13 depicts this basic infrastructure of the system . Both clients are connected to a central server and additionally direct via a network connection . Thereby , one client ( facilitator client ) is responsible for retrieving data from the digital pens and for sending commands to the other client ( group client ) . The stroke data from the pens via a Bluetooth connection is converted into visual sketch representations that are stored within the central database . Both clients connect to this central database and update their contents as soon as sketch representations are changed via the clients . The main client , which is responsible for most functionality is controlled via the facilitator display using touch interaction modalities . The secondary client which runs on the group display is controlled entirely through network commands . For example , if a user triggers a highlighting command via the paper interface , the facilitator client receives the data from the digital pen , converts it into a command and sends it to the group client via a network broadcast . Optimizations were required to quickly process the commands within both clients as to minimize the lag between user interaction and feedback from the system . Printing functionality – which was found to be quite demanding on processing time – was offloaded to the group client , as to care for fluent response on the facilitator client at all times . The facilitator client calculates and renders a dynamic and interactive visualization and hence printing management would interfere with the fluency and responsiveness of the hyperbolic tree visualization . In contrast , the group client is only presenting mostly static information and is hence suitable for supporting the printing process . For printing , stroke data received from the pens is converted into vector graphics and added to Anoto paper documents that are then augmented with the interactive areas . IdeaVis 155 An important fundament to the design activity visualization is the recording and analysis of stroke data from multiple digital pens . As this is the foundation to the tree structure of the interactive visualization on the facilitator display , it will be discussed in more detail . Figure 5 . 14 depicts the procedure of stroke processing and analysis which is implemented in the facilitator client . Once a sketch is produced on paper , a digital version is recorded in the system ( Figure 5 . 14 , 1 ) . It stores the pen id and the paper id . When a different pen is used on the same sheet of paper , a second version is linked to this item ( Figure 5 . 14 , 2 ) . This continues for each unique pen that is used on that paper , building a chain of versions ( Figure 5 . 14 , 3 ) . Note that this chain is only known to the system , as users are not able to distinguish between different pens by looking at the paper only ( except possibly in the case of handwriting ) . In the case of a print command , the system forks the trajectory , creating a tree - like versioning history ( Figure 5 . 14 , 4 ) . For the printout and the original , the procedure may continue recursively from the second step ( Figure 5 . 14 , 2 ) . The stroke processing hence produces a tree - like structure for each idea that is recorded in the system . In the case of multiple ideas , several of these trees will result , generating a large and deep hierarchical structure . Hence , it was decided to employ a focus and context visualization to convey the data in full details as it is being recorded . From the trajectory , information such as the number of unique ideas ( original paper sheets , id 1 . 0 ) , the number of links per idea ( annotations on the same paper with multiple pens , ids 1 . X ) and the number of variations ( copies of the paper , ids 1 . X . X ) can be calculated . This was also translated into a numerical versioning scheme , making each idea identifiable when exported into the file system . Figure 5 . 14 : The digital pen data is used for tracking changes on paper for creating a versioning trajectory . For exporting the recorded information , a converter was implemented that stores all digital sketch representations within a Portable Document Format file ( PDF ) . For this , stroke data is converted into vector graphics which guarantees a high - quality export that is suitable for reuse within common graphics and image manipulation software . The files are stored within the local file system on the facilitator client and hence can be copied after the session . They are named according to the versioning scheme , preserving the hierarchical information of the tree visualization . Facilitators may use this persistent documentation of the session contents for creating reports for later use within the design process . 5 . 4 Evaluation As within the first case study , an evaluation was conducted to investigate the potential success of the proposed design concepts . According to the third research objective , “Evaluate the developed tools as to assess the success of the proposed research” , a user study was conducted . As within the first Evaluation 156 case study , an observational user study was conducted and analyzed based on the previously defined tradeoff decisions ( see section 5 . 3 . 1 ) . 5 . 4 . 1 User Study The goal of the user study was to examine how the tradeoff decisions impact embodied practices and the methodic workflow of the Brainsketching method . Hence , the study was again not designed as a usability test or experiment , rather as an investigation of the holistic effects of the developed system design on work - related aspects and social dynamics . Further , the study should reveal if the tradeoff decisions were adequate and how they may be improved . Accordingly , an observational study to investigate how the provided tools might affect the work of designers and facilitators as well as the characteristics of the original technique was desired . Therefore , a controlled lab study with novice designers and professional creative facilitators was performed . Figure 5 . 15 : Physical setting used within the user study . Day one ( top ) with one facilitator , and day 2 ( bottom ) with two facilitators . For the user study , two groups of graduate students in industrial design ( N = 7 , 6 female , avg . age 27 years , study program “creative direction” ) and two professional facilitators from the innovation lab of Daimler AG ( male , avg . age 41 . 5 years , avg . experience 4 years ) were invited . Over two days , four Brainsketching sessions were conducted in the local lab on campus using the above described prototype implementation . Two sessions were practiced in a traditional way using pen & paper and a pin - board , and two sessions were conducted using the IdeaVis system . This way , participants may compare their experiences practicing the method with and without the system . Therefore , a within - subjects design using the same group of students for both conditions was applied . On both days , the IdeaVis 157 traditional session was conducted before the IdeaVis session . Each activity lasted between 1 and 1 . 5 hours with breaks in between to minimize fatigue . As it was desired that both sessions would take place in the same room , the setup for the traditional sessions was created by replacing the group display with a pin - board and by replacing the supplied paper with non - interactive , blank sheets . However , participants worked with the digital pens in both conditions in order to minimize the effects other tools may have . Based on recommendations by the creative facilitators , a standing - height table was provided as primary work surface . The use of IdeaVis involves leaving the group occasionally , thereby creating a tradeoff between the use of verbal conversations or non - verbal communication via the system . To investigate this , one facilitator was employed on the first day and a team of two facilitators on the second day . Figure 5 . 15 shows the use of the system on the first day ( top ) and on the second day ( bottom ) . The study procedure was designed as follows . As a first step , all participants were introduced to the Brainsketching method with a warming - up activity . Similarly , all participants were introduced to the prototype tool with a demonstration and exercise of the paper - based interaction techniques . The facilitators were also introduced to the visualization and were given a handout with a summary of available functionality . The participants were then asked to work on rather every - day design problems that do not require a thorough analysis . The tasks were defined independently by the facilitators . The first objective was : “How to get people to return their coffee cup after meetings ? ” and the second objective was : “How to get people in meetings to use their coffee cup more than once ? ” . The same objectives were used on both days , but their order was alternated . For the analysis , data in the form of questionnaires , video recordings , observation notes and still photos was collected . A focus group with all participants complemented each day . Two types of questionnaires were handed out before and after each session . All sessions were further recorded using a digital video camera with a wide angle that covered both the group’s activity and the work of the facilitator ( see Figure 5 . 15 ) . The use of functionalities like printing , highlighting , rating , identifying , and combining was logged to a text file . The material was then analyzed based on the tradeoff decisions within a qualitative content analysis . Therefore , evidence for each tradeoff decision was examined by looking at the frequency of use ( logging data ) , problems occurring with the use of the functionality ( observation notes and focus group ) , rating scores of functionality ( questionnaires , 7 point Likert scale , 1 = strongly agree , 7 = strongly disagree ) , by scanning and extracting video sequences and by partly transcribing verbal communication of the focus group . For more details on the data analysis , see Budzinski ( 2012 ) . 5 . 4 . 2 Results and Discussion As within the first case study , the results of the qualitative analysis are presented and discussed along the tradeoff decisions that characterize the system design . Therefore , the tradeoffs are approached from their primary intent of preserving practices ( T1 ) up to tradeoffs that target augmentation ( T3 ) . This will allow investigating if the implementation of the interaction techniques had the desired impact within the overall tool design and application domain ( see Table 5 . 3 ) . The first tradeoff decision ( T1 ) may be regarded by looking at the effects the provided digital pen & paper tools had on the design method and their impact on the work of the facilitator . As previously described , the digital pens were used in both conditions . Thus , subjective feedback from participants and the facilitators was elicited regarding a comparison of digital pen practice to traditional practice . Overall , during all sessions participants had no problems in externalizing their ideas with digital pen & paper material and the use of the table ( M = 1 . 86 , SD = 1 . 01 ) . Participants argued that the pens are very similar to traditional pens , however slightly more uncomfortable due to their larger size and Evaluation 158 weight . They also stated that they were not hesitant in using the digital pens although awareness of the fact that all interactions are recorded within a digital repository . Hence , the use of the pens did not lead to evaluation apprehension issues . Figure 5 . 16 : Use of digital pen & paper in the group was observed to have the same effects as traditional paper . Collaboration ( a ) , individual ideation ( b ) , bodily communication ( c ) and rating in individual workspaces ( d ) . Not surprisingly , similar interactions as with regular paper , like skipping , grabbing and turning as means for transferring artifacts between individual and shared workspaces were observed . This is of course due to the digital pen & paper printouts that are mostly identical to traditional paper sheets . The same characteristics were observed as in the initial observation , such as shared workspaces ( see Figure 5 . 17 , a ) , private workspaces used within ideation ( see Figure 5 . 17 , b ) , bodily communication ( see Figure 5 . 17 , c ) and individual workspaces for rating ideas ( see Figure 5 . 17 , d ) . Further , deictic references were frequently used accompanying discussion and presentation activities . The facilitators also did not see any negative impact of their work practices with the use of the digital pens . Therefore , one may conclude that the digital pen & paper material did not affect traditional workflows in a negative way ; rather it largely preserved embodied practices . Within the second tradeoff decision , a group display and paper - based interaction techniques were employed for supporting highlighting , copying and rating ( T2 ) . These interaction techniques significantly departed from what is possible with traditional media and hence may have a negative impact on the workflow of the method . However , all participants found the functionality of the paper interface generally useful ( M = 2 . 0 , SD = 1 . 73 ) . They also agreed that the functions were easy to use ( M = 2 . 43 , SD = 1 . 61 ) and that the feedback provided by the system was sufficient ( M = 1 . 43 , SD = 1 . 13 ) . The presentation function was consistently considered helpful for showing ideas to the group ( M = 2 , SD = 1 . 33 ) . During discussion however , the display was used mostly exclusively and participants almost forgot about the physical paper . The facilitators stated that the immersive size and quality of the display had a strong influence on attention and that it is a very powerful tool for controlling the focus of the group . The rating function was not as easy to use as the other functions ( M = 3 . 29 , SD = 2 . 14 ) . It was observed that some users had problems using the gesture recognition template when gestures were not instantly recognized . Accordingly , a future implementation could rely on a IdeaVis 159 more simplified alternative , such as crossing out a box or scale . The copying functionality was used by five participants ( 9 out of 52 sketches were duplicated ) . Figure 5 . 17 : Use of the paper buttons for highlighting ideas . The technique was found to support fluent transitions from discussion ( a ) , over presenting on paper ( b ) , to presenting on the large display ( c ) . They all strongly agreed that it is a helpful functionality for distributing ideas ( N = 5 , M = 1 . 0 , SD = 0 ) . Printing was however used mostly by the facilitators who referred to it in order to distribute ideas to specific persons in the group . The facilitators did incorporate the printing functionality within their work practices . Asked for their reasons in doing so , they said : “So , I just wanted to try this function because it promotes branches of the design content . Then , two persons can work at the same time into two different directions” . This statement supports the usefulness of this functionality for branching ideas . The questionnaires revealed that evaluation apprehension was no issue within the groups ( fear of criticizing : M = 6 . 86 , SD = 0 . 38 ) . This fact , and the availability of the group display , limited the use of the printing function since it was not required as compensation to evaluation apprehension ( copying to avoid destruction of original sketches of others ) . On both days , the copies were used as intended , for adding annotations rather than for re - interpretations . When participants were asked to compare their experiences with IdeaVis with the traditional sessions , all of them agreed that it did enhance the original procedure . However , while the group stated that the use of the display is certainly a benefit for them , they particularly appreciated that they did not have to leave their individual workspaces for using the system features , hence preserving the social situation . The facilitators found most value in the additional options the paper has for controlling the group without having to use the facilitator display . Eventually , the third tradeoff decision provided an interactive visualization for facilitators ( T3 ) . In comparison with the other tradeoffs , this is certainly the most powerful , providing tools that are not required by the method itself . Therefore , the facilitators had to adapt their traditional strategies in order to make use of the visualization . The use of a co - facilitator who is dedicated to analyzing the Evaluation 160 design activity in the background ( see Figure 5 . 18 , left ) was found to be most effective . This strategy was instantly favored by the facilitators on the second day as they have similar practices when conducting creativity workshops with multiple groups . Asked for their value in cooperation , the group facilitator stated that “ [ the co - facilitator ] contributes to the problem - solving process and he can ask specific questions to the facilitator or to the group . This doesn’t make the session more creative but more productive , as [ the co - facilitator ] can ask the ‘better’ questions” . The co - facilitator did only have to communicate with the group facilitator directly ( mostly through gestures and short comments ) and only indirectly with the group by using the system or by exchanging printed artifacts ( see Figure 5 . 18 , left ) . This way , he could make more frequent use of the identification , printing , combining and highlighting functionality within the toolbox of the sketches than the single facilitator was able to do on the first day . When asked , the co - facilitator did state that he used these features mostly for finding interesting ideas and for enforcing a re - interpretation or clarification of these sketches . Figure 5 . 18 : Collaboration of facilitator and co - facilitator ( left ) , collecting and combining ideas ( right ) . The concept of combining ideas on a single paper sheet via the clipboard ( see Figure 5 . 18 , right ) proved to be useful for communication between the facilitators . This confirms the assumption that the visualization is used most effectively for directing the group toward convergence . By scanning the tree for modifications indicated by the fading glow , the co - facilitator was constantly tracking changes and modifications as the group was progressing toward a presentation or discussion . Once the discussion started , the co - facilitator was able to interfere either with the group or the group facilitator . Both facilitators stated that the focus & context nature of the visualization is valuable for having all states of the process visible and that the trajectory is indeed an adequate way of capturing and analyzing sketching activities in rich detail . They especially emphasized the value it has for improving their daily work not only during the sessions but also after the sessions . When asked for the most unique benefits of the visualization , the facilitators stated that fixations are instantly recognizable by especially deep trajectories in the tree . The zooming functionality of the visualization proved to be essential as the facilitators made frequent use of it for navigating and examining sketches in detail ( see Figure 5 . 19 ) . The facilitators highlighted that the benefit of the visualization may further increase with the number of participants and when the amount of design material rises beyond what is easy to handle in physical practice . Both facilitators agreed that the visualization opens up a different , more content - focused view on the creative process than is possible with observing the session in a traditional way . Overall , the facilitators stated that IdeaVis can indeed provide a benefit for better understanding group dynamics during the session and for improving awareness and communication abilities . However , they also said that the system should be extended with a manual clustering functionality to allow for collecting good ideas as a complement to the existing automatically generated visualization . Being able to combine sketches via the clipboard is a step toward this direction , but may be further improved with more IdeaVis 161 flexibility such as manual clustering techniques ( see Chapter 6 ) . Further suggestions were the use of a tablet device for the facilitator display as this may reduce the division of attention between the visualization and the group . Further , this would reduce the need for leaving the group when analyzing the design session . On the other hand , this decision would make it harder to navigate the visualization and would also make it harder to recognize sketches visually . Figure 5 . 19 : Navigation within the visualization was found to be a key interaction as browsing the session requires constant switching between overview ( tree ) and detail ( individual sketches ) . After describing the effects of the individual design decisions implied by the tradeoffs , the overall impact of the design tool on the method is assessed by focusing on potential benefits and drawbacks of employing the tool in relation to embodied practice . As the most important goal is to preserve embodied practice by still adding functionality , possible conflicts are emphasized . As argued above , the introduction of digital pen & paper ( T1 ) did not have any negative impact on the design method . In contrast , it essentially preserved the basic workflow of the Brainsketching method due to its compatibility with the traditional workspace layout such as individual and shared areas . Both , individual ideation and collaborative sharing activities were practiced naturally and fluently by all participants . Inhibitors such as evaluation apprehension were no issue because the paper facilitates privacy and informality . Even though all content is recorded within a digital system , this did not impact the behavior of the participants . The quality of interacting with the digital pen & paper artifacts can hence be considered mostly equivalent to traditional material . At the same time however , the digital pen & paper technology enabled more advanced features for the other tradeoffs . Tradeoffs that had the goal of augmenting were mostly optional to the method itself and hence may be judged by their frequency of use and usefulness within the sessions . Further , their effect on divergent and convergent modes of creativity may be assessed . The paper - based interaction techniques for presenting such as the highlighting technique were found to be complementary to the basic workflow – meaning that they were only used when needed . For example , participants switched to the large overview display for discussing artifacts in the group but also used the paper for discussing in peers . This indicates that the traditional workflow is preserved , while improved visibility and accessibility was achieved . Both facilitators agreed that the group display is a powerful tool for controlling the focus of the group and that they see most benefit in increased awareness and focus for re - interpretation . Hence , the highlighting function contributes to the goal of increasing group awareness . The highlighting functionality was the most used of the three paper - based interaction techniques . It is argued here that it is the most useful functionality of the paper interface . The rating Summary & Contributions 162 functionality however can be considered less important as it did not augment the process . Rather it was an insufficient replication of the traditional practice . The duplication features for copying ideas was perceived well by the facilitators . However , the group members were less interested in using the functionality . This indicates that it failed as a tool for avoiding evaluation apprehension . Rather , it was shown that it is most useful as a tool for directing and controlling the session proceeding toward convergence . This , as confirmed by the facilitators is a true augmentation of the traditional workflow . Yet , the true effect of the ability to duplicate ideas for distribution in the group cannot be measured more precisely . A longitudinal field study is suggested to investigate this effect in more detail . Regarding the most powerful tradeoff , interactive visualizations were introduced that enable facilitators to observe and analyze the session through a content - based hierarchical view . The functionality can be considered an optional augmentation of the process , as facilitators do not have to work with the visualization to direct the session . Rather , it is entirely optional and may be used as required . In the user study , the visualization was most effectively used in a cooperation of two facilitators . This practice thus augmented the roles of facilitators and co - facilitators that were also present in the traditional workflow , where multiple facilitators work together in directing large or multiple small groups ( see section 5 . 2 . 2 ) . It can be used to modify the proceedings of the session by introducing new unobtrusive ways of intervening in the sketching process . These new modalities for interacting with design material augment the sketching process in a novel way . However , even when only used by a single facilitator , the visualization was confirmed to have benefits for controlling convergence and for improving documenting of the session . As all states of the Brainsketching activity are recorded and persistently stored in a database , accessibility of the design material is guaranteed . This is in contrast to traditional practice , where the produced artifacts have to be manually documented and analyzed after the session . As the capturing and documentation features do not require explicit interaction , they can be considered as both augmentation and preservation . Overall , the following implications for design may be extracted from the analysis of the user study : When preserving characteristics of traditional practice , great attention has to be paid on the compatibility of the consequences of tradeoff decisions . Preserving the overall characteristics of embodied design practices may lead to limitations regarding the support for some specific sub - activities ( e . g . rating ) . Augmenting the method with functionality does not always have to impact the workflow when it is optional to the method itself ( e . g . documentation ) . However , its usefulness depends on the degree of appropriation from the users ( e . g . visualization ) . 5 . 5 Summary & Contributions In the following , the contributions of this second case study are summarized . Therefore , the IdeaVis system is compared with other related design tools . Differences from existing research are summarized to emphasize how the developed tool contributes to the general design knowledge within creativity support systems . This may be either by providing extensions or modifications of existing design concepts . Eventually , the technical contributions as well as empirical contributions of the case study are discussed . IdeaVis 163 5 . 5 . 1 Related Work IdeaVis relates to research in computing environments for co - located creative group work in general , and in particular to systems that explicitly support methodic sketching activities with presentation support , tangible or spatial interfaces and automatic documentation . The most apparent related systems from the initially conducted review ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) are digital environments for digital pen interaction in groups such as i - LAND ( Streitz et al . , 1999 ) and TEAM STORM ( Hailpern et al . , 2007 ) . i - LAND mixes interactive surfaces , tables , walls and mobile devices for supporting fluent creative collaboration and for easing the transfer of information across devices . However , it is not attuned to a particular methodic workflow and rather refers to “creative activities” in general . By looking at the system features however , it is more targeted toward the technical ability of creating and managing sketches with digital modalities . This is in contrast to the research at hand that emphasizes the use of traditional material such as paper for externalization . Accordingly , the philosophies behind the systems are entirely different . Similarly , TEAM STORM combines multiple Tablet PCs with an interactive whiteboard for supporting the management of multiple ideas within collaborative sketching sessions . Sketches can be transferred from the tablet devices to the shared whiteboard . The system thus supports similar presentation functionality as IdeaVis . The authors also explicitly address a traditional workflow and social factors as a part of their system design . However , the tool entirely replaces traditional practices , requiring the exclusive use of digital modalities . Compared to the IdeaVis approach , it lacks support for paper - based sketching techniques and does not explicitly care for facilitators . This case study hence contributes an extension to existing collaborative sketching tools regarding support for more informal externalization with material artifacts one the one hand , and support for unobtrusive documentation functionality on the other hand . The presented approach also has some relations to hybrid digital tools such as The Designer’s Outpost ( Klemmer et al . , 2001a ) , Pictionaire ( Hartmann et al . , 2010 ) , Diamond’s Edge ( Bernstein et al . , 2006 ) and the Nice Discussion Room ( Haller et al . , 2010 ) . All systems share the ability to combine physical paper with interactive displays . Thereby , physical and digital representations are bridged or duplicated to support the brainstorming , documentation and sharing of ideas . Vision - based systems such as The Designer’s Outpost and Pictionaire however take a different approach , using overhead image capture and projection to merge physical artifacts with digital annotations . This is in contrast to paper - based support for sketching which was also successfully demonstrated in several other systems such as the Diamond’s Edge and the Nice Discussion Room . Like the IdeaVis system , these tools integrate digital pen & paper with large displays or interactive tabletops for supporting work with material paper artifacts or for augmenting these artifacts with digital functionality . However , IdeaVis takes a different approach , caring for a specific sketching method and workflow , social factors and a facilitator . It can also be considered more subtle , not requiring the use of technology but offering it in an optional way for augmenting practices without forcing the users to use digital modalities . Eventually , the presented system makes use of interactive visualizations for augmenting awareness and communication abilities of facilitators . Such functionality has not yet been explored in the context of paper - based sketching sessions . Yet , it shares some goals with The Designer’s Outpost , which explored a design history functionality that allows capturing and replaying web - design sessions ( Klemmer , Thomsen , Phelps - Goodman , Lee , & Landay , 2002 ) . The design history functionality however is limited to capturing the states of the session through user interaction rather than fully automated in the background . Further , the design history visualization is conveyed through a timeline that does not care for variations or alternatives and idea forking . The EDC ( Arias et al . , 2000 ) also employs a dedicated reflection and facilitation display in the urban planning context . The display can Summary & Contributions 164 be used by facilitators for analyzing the data which is being produced in the collaborative design session . Thereby , it also supports an expert in directing the session . Yet , the system is not oriented toward the support of traditional methodic paper - based design practices , like sketching sessions . The IdeaVis approach extends such functionality toward live content - based analysis and interactive visualization that can be used by facilitators during the session . One may summarize that a subtle , paper - based support for specific sketching methods and support for session facilitators has not been demonstrated before . The IdeaVis system closes these identified research gaps by offering support for the workflows of traditional paper - based sketching techniques and by explicitly supporting the role of creative facilitators . Additionally , the system design is grounded in explicit tradeoffs between physical practice and digital tool support , something that is not fond in other existing works . 5 . 5 . 2 Conceptual and Technical Contributions This case study contributes conceptual and technical solutions that can be applied to the domain of creative group work in general and for embodied design practices in particular . Yet , some concepts may also be applied to more general group work systems . Table 5 . 4 summarizes the design solutions exemplified with IdeaVis . It also describes how the design tool addresses current limitations of digital creativity support ( see section 3 . 1 . 4 ) as well as guidelines and requirements for such systems ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 ) . In this regard , it is very similar to the guidelines addressed within the first case study . Table 5 . 4 : IdeaVis addresses limitations as well guidelines and requirements for creativity support . Externalization Reflection Collaboration Process Ideation with digital pen & paper is fluent and unobtrusive Storage and retrieval through database persistence Workspace design allows for ad - hoc use Preserves important aspects of the traditional method through entirely optional functionality Support for annotation , gesturing and bodily movement Imprecise representations through informal artifacts and tools fluent transitions between collaboration modes through workspace territories Automatic documentation through capture and visualization The interface is hidden from the user – the content is the interface D ynamic views for comparing ideas spatially Tangible artifacts provide group affordances ( embodied facilitation ) Some activities are augmented through additional functionality Highlighting function supports reflection and convergence System design cares for embodied actions and social factors System designed for and with designers and facilitators IdeaVis effectively addresses embodied design practices as described in section 2 . 2 . It preserves the basic workflow and social dynamics of sketching sessions by keeping the benefits of paper material and workspace territories . Nevertheless , similar to the AffinityTable system , it augments reflection activities by providing a reflection display and highlighting functionality . Hence , it also synthesizes the known benefits of horizontal and vertical work surfaces in its system design . Using very simple transfer mechanisms with the use of a paper interface , the system also supports rapid cycles of externalization and reflection . As a result , the visibility and accessibility of design artifacts is enhanced by preserving handling benefits of material artifacts at the same time . Bodily characteristics such as deictic references or implicit group communication were not altered and are in line with the IdeaVis 165 observations reported in section 5 . 2 . 1 . Through a careful augmentation of the collaborative and social aspects of the design method , the system also cares for active facilitation using embodied strategies . Using the system , a facilitator has material and implicit communication tools for controlling a session that are not available by relying on traditional practice only . By utilizing the system , facilitators may harness computer - generated material and duplicated externalizations for directing the group , which augments the workflow toward convergence . Functionality such as combining ideas in a sketch printout is utilized without the need for manipulating a digital tool with formal interaction modalities . Rather , the functionalities are available via a simple direct touch interface . The augmenting functionalities of IdeaVis may however also be adapted for use in more general activities that include the need for discussion and annotation as well as facilitation and analysis . For supporting discussion and annotation , the system demonstrates fluent mechanisms for collecting and combining informal feedback from a group . As information is distributed informally via paper to multiple users , people may work independently in parallel while their annotations are synchronized into one common digital representation . This functionality might for example also be used for discussing other material such as image collections or text documents . Hence , it is also applicable to collaborative qualitative data analysis or for the categorization of existing material information such as for collaborative document analysis . As a history of annotations on documents is kept , the results can also be used for analysis during or after the session . For discussion , the presentation functionality via the paper interface may be used on different materials for presenting content that is printed on paper artifacts . The navigation between overview and a detailed view thereby implicitly selects the focus of discussion to achieve convergence and group awareness . For facilitation and analysis , the concept of design activity visualization may be appropriated to other situations as well . A live analysis of collaborative contributions and the evolution of this process may be helpful for a variety of application domains that deal with dynamic , material and messy group situations . For example , the automatic documentation and visualization features are useful during collaborative elaboration ( e . g . creating material such as text or sketches ) and for ad - hoc analysis during the session ( e . g . analysis of contributions ) . The mechanism may be adapted to support other design activities such as more loosely defined brainstorming methods , but also more content - focused techniques such as storyboarding or paper prototyping . Yet , it may also be applied to individual work that is generative and evolutionary in nature . As all steps of the work process are documented , a rich history is maintained that is helpful in both individual and cooperative reflection . For example , it could also be added to the AffinityTable system . Accordingly , different visualizations may be used depending on the workflow and material of the design method . Visualizations such as clusters are promising alternatives to the employed tree visualization . Facilitation functionalities such as presentation of sketches within the group may then be used for more general reflection activities . 5 . 5 . 3 Empirical Contributions As within the first case study , the empirical contributions of this investigation are based on the findings within both user studies . Firstly , knowledge was produced concerning the use of material artifacts and spatial environments in collaborative sketching workflows that may be used for deriving design requirements and recommendations . Secondly , findings from the user study with the prototype tool can be used by other designers that work on similar issues . Within the initial observational study and workshops with facilitators , emphasis was put on the characteristics of embodied externalization , reflection and collaboration as well as their relation to the particular workflow of the Brainsketching method . While these findings were derived regarding this specific design method , they may also be valid for similar collaborative design methods that rely on Summary & Contributions 166 content creation , annotation and facilitation . For example , use and appropriation of individual workspaces , shared references on wall displays and mechanisms of artifact sharing and handling are in line with findings from the first case study . However , the specific characteristics of annotation and facilitation are unique to the method and hence extend existing knowledge . These findings might also relate to similar group activities such as collaborative document editing and sharing . The needs and strategies of facilitators for directing creative sessions are not specific to the employed method , but were rather derived from a more general context of creativity workshops involving a multitude of methods . Hence , they can be considered as more general , applying to many other design methods as well . Researchers may refer to these findings for envisioning new kinds of facilitator support tools or design activity visualizations . The user study conducted with the prototype tool IdeaVis contributes to the knowledge on the relation of digital tools to embodied collaborative design practices . The observation results indicate which kind of interaction techniques might be suitable to support both designers and facilitators . This knowledge can be used by researchers that are interested in similar issues and may specifically assist in finding a careful and seamless integration into existing design methodologies . Especially the findings regarding support for facilitation strategies contribute to a new design space that has not been explored beforehand . Hence , the concepts and findings presented for supporting the work of facilitators is considered far from being exhaustively investigated . Researchers may use this as stimulus and inspiration for developing alternative methods of facilitation using embodied interaction concepts .

As a result of the previous studies , this theme emerged as particular important . Rather than focusing on another design method and workflow , this case study hence concentrates the research efforts on concrete techniques for documenting and organizing design knowledge . This characteristic of design processes is an integral part of many design methods and is also a crucial feature for transferring design concepts between persons , locations and multiple activities within the design process . Although this study is smaller in scope than the previous case studies , it provides a more thorough investigation in specific interaction techniques for harnessing spatial characteristics of digital work surfaces . It thus can also be considered an extension and improvement to the previously developed prototype systems in one 6 Case Selection 170 particular aspect . Accordingly , it also contributes to the RO2 : “Design and develop new digital tools and interaction techniques to preserve and augment specific collaborative design activities” . The design process applied within this case study is again based on the previously devised design methodology ( see section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . However , as findings from the previous studies already indicate the needs and requirements for the research , the conducted analysis focuses on the relation of existing digital tools to embodied design practices . For addressing RO3 : “Evaluate the developed tools as to assess the success of the proposed research” , an experimental user study was conducted to compare two interface variants . Further , a user study is reported within the context of design process reflection activities . The chapter is again based on the parts of analysis , design , evaluation and contribution . The research in this chapter was the result of collaborations between multiple researchers . Contributing researchers were : The author was responsible for the research design , conceptual design , experimental design , implementation , observations and analysis , user studies and dissemination ; Anita Höchtl ( student researcher ) contributed to conceptual design , implementation and data analysis of the comparative experiment reported in this chapter ; Johannes Zagermann ( student researcher ) contributed to the contextual user study on design process reflection .

This way , a further investigation would not extend the knowledge toward other design methods but rather intensify it within one particular theme . One particular important characteristic of both design methods explored within the previous research was the need for documenting and 37 http : / / youtu . be / EKzo5r3hWyA ArtifactBubbles 171 organizing design artifacts as the result of the collaborative design sessions . Only through an externalization and persistent storage of the created design knowledge , designers may harness the results of the activities for communicating , sharing , reusing and archiving their efforts . In affinity diagramming , a diagram or collection of design artifacts is the result of the session ( see Figure 6 . 1 , right ) . Designers may refer to the results by reflecting upon this representation in later stages of the design process , for example as a stimulus or reminder . Therefore , they need to store and retrieve it as desired . Similarly , Brainsketching sessions lead to a large amount of artifacts , revisions and re - interpretations that manifest within piles and collections of paper sheets . Documenting such processes also means that designers have to select and categorize the results in order to make them more accessible for reuse ( see Figure 6 . 1 , left ) . The activity of documenting and organizing design artifacts in collaborative settings was shown to be especially important during sense - making activities and during reflection ( see section 2 . 2 . 1 ) . Facilitators of creative sessions further emphasized the value of documentation not only of session results , but also within the larger design process ( see section 2 . 2 . 3 ) . Figure 6 . 1 : As a result of the Brainsketching and Affinity Diagramming sessions , artifacts were documented for later reuse and reflection ; collection of valuable ideas on a whiteboard ( left ) , clusters of an affinity diagram ( right ) . Nevertheless , the conducted case studies have revealed that exactly these activities are especially hard to support using digital technology . Within the AffinityTable system , users used manual spatial organization of design artifacts as a tool for sense - making and categorization of design material , stimulating them to achieve consensus through reflection and discussion . This activity was found to be the most crucial and most time consuming part of the method ( see section 4 . 2 . 1 ) . Yet , the implemented interaction techniques for handling and clustering digital artifacts were not entirely successful – imposing limitations on the effectiveness of the prototype design tool ( see section 4 . 4 . 2 ) . Within the IdeaVis system , documentation and organization of design artifacts was completely automated , not requiring manual interaction by the users as artifacts were automatically analyzed and documented within two different visualizations ( group display and facilitator display ) based on the processed data supplied by the digital pens . Yet , it was found that the facilitators desired more flexible and manual ways of organizing and categorizing design artifacts ( see section 5 . 4 . 2 ) . By offering such functionality to the facilitators , the system would have better supported individual reflection and documentation for reuse . The activity of documenting and organizing intermediate and final results of a design process or design activities is well documented . Sharmin et al . for example report on the value of design knowledge reuse and the limitations of digital tools for supporting such tasks ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . Based on a contextual analysis in professional design practice , the authors discuss the reasons why designers document and organize their design artifacts . Among these findings are the themes of : Case Selection 172 1 ) Knowledge generation 2 ) Foraging for inspiration 3 ) Storage 4 ) Organization 5 ) Retrieval 6 ) Sharing Firstly , designers utilize documentation naturally as a part of their knowledge generation processes . As most design methods generate new design knowledge , designers have to deal with the created artifacts . According to Sharmin et al . generating and visualizing multiple ideas within a visual documentation supports divergent thinking as it helps to understand the problem , prevents fixation , triggers new thought and assists in choosing promising ideas ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . Hence , it also contributes to convergent modes of creativity , where multiple ideas have to be synthesized . Secondly , designers utilize documentation as a tool for foraging when they are elaborating on new design directions . Hence , they browse existing design knowledge from previous projects or activities as well as design knowledge created by other designers . The intention behind this approach is that this would help finding new connections with the current design focus . Researchers have investigated this activity of “example finding” as a promising direction for computer - supported augmentation ( Herring , Chang , et al . , 2009 ; Keller et al . , 2006 ) . Sources of inspiration may therefore be found within the current project ( e . g . previous design activities ) , past projects ( e . g . repositories or archives ) or from external parties ( e . g . collaborators ) . Sharmin et al . also found that designers document due to their desire to store almost everything they produce during early design phases ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . This is because immense intellectual value is ascribed to their creations , because they regard the design material as too valuable to discard , and because they believe that it may be of further value in the design process or future design projects . Designers utilize different strategies for organizing design knowledge such as physical - personal ( e . g . sketchbook , folders , boxes ) , shared - physical ( e . g . pinboard , whiteboard , wall ) , electronic - personal ( e . g . file folders , hard - drives ) or electronic - shared ( e . g . servers , wikis , web ) . Regardless of the strategy , Sharmin et al . characterize the organization of design material as “messy” as no consistent naming schemes or structures were found . Rather , the documented material can be described as loosely defined collections or informal notes and logs . Frequently , different names based on versions of the design material are used ( e . g . draft1 . 0 , final , final - final ) . The authors argue that a formal organization frequently fails due to a lack of motivation and the fact that electronic meta - data such as file names is not capable of capturing the meaning of particular design artifacts . Rather , the meaning is often only understood through a story or an event that is related to the context of an artifact or a collection of artifacts . This is in line with a study reported by Cross on knowledge management practices in early engineering design ( Cross , 1996 ) . As a further theme , designers were observed to retrieve artifacts from documentations due to several reasons such as to aid ideation , for sharing , for comparing related ideas , to reflect on the design process ( e . g . design process maps , see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) , to re - interpret past knowledge , to search for expertise or to facilitate story - telling ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . A particular noteworthy effect during this activity is the complexity of search that is involved . As design material is frequently visual and no meta - data or structure is evident from design artifact collections , retrieving involves the browsing of design content to recognize the desired artifacts visually . As this is however complex and time - consuming , current retrieval methods were found to impede the reuse of design knowledge – limiting the benefits they might yield for improving design processes . Among the most important “hints” for identifying design knowledge were the project context , the creation date , the type of artifact ( e . g . sketch , image ) , the location , and the author of artifacts . Eventually , Sharmin et al . found that design knowledge documentation is tightly connected to social sharing activities such as discussions , meetings and design critique ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . Pro - active sharing is conducted to generate awareness of design ideas in a group or ArtifactBubbles 173 design studio and to help other designers . The shared artifacts then prompt communication and reflection and may even trigger ad - hoc brainstorming . Overall , the documentation of design artifacts is a complex issue that is rather poorly supported by embodied design practices but also by existing digital tools . Within traditional design practice , artifacts are documented in a shared - physical representation , using a material medium such as paper , pinboards or walls . While this allows designers to easily arrange and organize design artifacts spatially without the need to define naming schemes or hierarchical structures , this procedure is limited in terms of storage space , persistence , sharing and accessibility . For example , collages of design knowledge that are being documented on wall collages eventually have to be cleared to care for new content as the wall fills up . Once taken off the wall , the material however loses most of its value in visibility , persistence and accessibility as it then needs to be browsed manually . Frequently , designers transfer the created artifacts or collages into digital systems by taking and archiving digital photos ( Keller et al . , 2006 ) . The conversion into this shared - digital representation however leads to the artifacts ending up in files , folders and lists – losing their situational and spatial context and the relations in - between artifact locations . As a result , the design knowledge is being isolated and hidden , making it less visible and accessible for reuse and reflection . Accordingly , there is a tension between shared - digital and shared - physical representations that may be approached by harnessing the benefits of hybrid digital design tools such as AffinityTable and IdeaVis for documentation and organization purposes . Digital tools for design knowledge documentation and sharing can be found within research and commercial practice . For short term documentation such as for documenting the results of a design method , some hybrid digital tools such as The Designer’s Outpost ( Klemmer et al . , 2001b ) , Pictionaire ( Hartmann et al . , 2010 ) and Cabinet ( Keller et al . , 2006 ) provide reasonable approaches that are superior to taking digital images . By capturing and archiving the activity itself through the use of entirely digital or hybrid design material , data is stored that can be retrieved later on . The restored activity has the same quality as the original hybrid design material as it is not converted into a different representation . Both prototypes developed in the previous case studies are contributing to these themes and hence already address this strategy of documentation . However , this approach is only feasible for one particular design method and not for a series of activities within a longer term . Tools such as IdeaSpaces ( Venkataswamy et al . , 2009 ) and Dazzle ( Oehlberg et al . , 2012 ) aim at supporting long term documentation and sharing of design content . Based on graphical user interfaces , they provide ways of archiving design content within digital representations that deviate from files , folders and hierarchies . IdeaSpaces utilizes a web - based interface for posting and discussing design materials online . Similarly , Dazzle provides a list - based view on a shared design artifact repository . The list , which is available as a desktop widget , serves as a shared reference to design material within a group . Items in the list such as digital images or photographed whiteboard sketches can be tagged and browsed within the chronological list . Similar functionality is available within digital note - taking solutions such as Evernote 38 or Microsoft OneNote 39 . Both commercially available tools facilitate capturing and sharing of informal material such as notes and thus may also be appropriated for documenting design processes . Their capturing mechanisms aim at seamless integration of physical artifacts . However , they are not attuned for the use in design processes . The research projects CAM ( Cooperative Artefact Memory ) ( Vyas et al . , 2010 ) and the Ideas Design Ecology ( Lee , 2007 ) feature similar capturing features within the context of design tools . Dedicated tools for documentation were also presented by design researchers . The desktop - based tool Freed ( Mendels et al . , 2011 ) for example provides a different approach , using spatial mind - map like dynamic 38 http : / / evernote . com 39 http : / / office . microsoft . com / en - us / onenote / Analysis 174 visualizations to support the documentation and reflection over design processes . Using an interactive spatial layout , the single - user tool allows visualizing the relations between different design artifacts and further supports the creation of multiple views on the collection . Another notable tool for design documentation is the PRT ( Project Reflection Tool ) ( Dalsgaard & Halskov , 2012 ) . The web - based interface allows the collaborative documentation of design activities based graphical and textual notes , events and a timeline view . However , as will be further discussed in the following analysis , these tools do not conform to embodied practices as they are bound to traditional desktop and GUI modalities . Due to these limitations , important qualities of design material are lost due to the digitalization process and formal ways of interaction . One may summarize that investigating more informal and spatial digital documentation strategies that are compatible with embodied design practices is a promising addition to the research proposed within this thesis . Hence , the activity of design knowledge documentation and organization is considered suitable as a third research focus as it : 1 ) can be frequently found within the domain of design , 2 ) is related to structured design methods and hence cares for appropriation , 3 ) is used within small face - to - face groups , 4 ) includes divergent and convergent characteristics of creativity , 5 ) relies on embodied aspects such as physical artifacts and spatial environments , and 6 ) is poorly supported by digital tools . 6 . 2 Analysis In the following , the investigation is approached by presenting an analysis of the actual practice of design process documentation . Therefore , the goal is to identify benefits and limitations of both embodied design practices and digital tools within this context . Because findings of the previous studies already contribute to an understanding of embodied practices for documenting and organizing design material ( see sections 4 . 2 . 1 and 5 . 2 . 1 ) , this analysis mainly focuses on digital methods . Accordingly , an explorative user study using a state - of - the - art digital documentation and sharing solution is reported and discussed . Eventually , a comparison to embodied practices is provided as a foundation to potential tradeoff decisions . 6 . 2 . 1 Explorative User Study To explore if and how digital tools may be useful for documenting collaborative design processes , a longitudinal user study was conducted and analyzed . The goal of the study was to investigate the activities and practices design groups perform when capturing , archiving and organizing intermediate design artifacts and final results throughout a design process . At the same time however , the study aimed to shed light on potential benefits and limitations of digital or hybrid design knowledge management techniques , visualizations and means of communication and coordination . In a first step , it was decided that the note - taking application Evernote would be best suitable as a representative of currently available informal documentation tools . Its functionalities as well as its visualization and interaction styles are very similar to those demonstrated by latest academic research such as the tools IdeaSpaces and Dazzle . However , it is readily available , well - known and popular among designers of different domains . The tool promises to ease capturing , archiving and organizing informal information artifacts like notes , lists , ideas , sketches , images or multi - media files such as video or audio . Accordingly , it supports a wide range of digital representations of design artifacts . Thereby , the Evernote system is centered on a traditional desktop application ( see Figure 6 . 2 ) and local storage , but also supports use on different mobile devices ( smartphones , tablets ) in combination with cloud synchronization and a web interface . As such a ubiquitous system , it cannot only be used for keeping private notes , but also for sharing notes with a group of collaborators via the cloud ArtifactBubbles 175 service and remote access . Notes in Evernote are structured using a combination of notebooks ( cf . folders ) , tags and a timeline list . When capturing notes with Evernote clients , metadata such as a timestamp , location , and author as well as modification history is added . Evernote further provides search and filtering functionality for retrieving notes based on their content ( e . g . ocr text recognition ) , metadata and tags . Artifacts are captured and added to the system either via the desktop application ( e . g . drag & drop ) , via email or directly using devices such as smartphones ( e . g . mobile image upload ) or tablets ( e . g . sketches ) . One of the unique characteristics of Evernote is that it supports capturing informal information artifacts within situated practice by providing a multitude of access points and device support ( e . g . sketches can be photographed or scanned and uploaded seamlessly ) . Based on these powerful features , it seems well suited for documenting the abundant and messy artifacts that accompany design processes . The functionalities of tagging and meta - data as well as retrieval go well beyond the options common file systems provide for organizing information collections . Figure 6 . 2 : Evernote provides functionality for capturing , archiving , organizing and sharing informal information artifacts . Different clients ( desktop , mobile , web ) allow structuring and retrieving artifacts using notebooks ( folders ) , lists and tags . The system allows ubiquitous access and sharing through a cloud synchronization system . The exploratory study was conducted with six teams of students ( N = 18 , 3 students per group ) over a four - month interaction design project . The project was embedded into an interaction design course and encompassed an analysis phase ( field study & observation ) , modeling activities ( user roles , personas , task models ) , a design phase ( scenarios & sketching ) as well as a prototyping phase ( implementation ) . Hence , all typical design methods such as paper - based brainstorming , sketching , paper prototyping and storyboarding were conducted within a structured process . The students had the assignment to design a mobile application ( App ) around certain themes like shopping , leisure and cooking . Each group decided on one particular theme before the design process started . Further , students were advised to use Evernote for documenting and sharing their progress in the group . Therefore , an introduction of the tool and its functionalities and best practices was given by a researcher . Students met weekly in dedicated design studio spaces but many design activities were also carried out in the field or at home . Premium Evernote accounts were set up for all groups so that participants could make use of advanced features such as notebook sharing and larger uploads . The use and appropriation of the tool was observed by questioning participants during the weekly meetings ( informal interviews ) and through a post - study quantitative questionnaire ( 7 point Likert scale ) . After the study , the collected material and data was analyzed using the methodology of qualitative content analysis . Analysis 176 6 . 2 . 2 Results and Discussion In the following , the results of the study are summarized and discussed . The focus of this analysis is on the motivation and typical use of the documentation tool and if the functionalities were adequate for the tasks of capturing , organizing , reusing and sharing design artifacts . Further , issues that were found to be supporting or inhibiting are compared within the thesis framework . Regarding the general use of the Evernote system , the documentation behavior of participants was observed and analyzed . Overall , all groups engaged in documentation activities , however this may also be due to the fact that they were graded based on the quality of their group work . From the post - study questionnaire ( N = 16 ) it was found that most participants ( 14 ) actively engaged in documentation activities . Further , 75 % of the participants stated that documentation tasks were equally distributed among the members of the groups . Yet , from own observations and from the data collected within the shared Evernote notebooks , it was evident that roles emerged within the group . Frequently , a dedicated role of a person responsible for documenting results of a design activity was evolving . These roles however switched persons during the process as documentation was not the most motivating part of the group work . 18 . 8 % of the participants stated that coordination regarding the actual procedure and responsibilities of documentation was required . As there are many ways of capturing and organizing notes within the tool , different capturing and organizing strategies were evaluated for making documentation activities most effortless . Although participants judged the documentation as rather important for their individual work ( 4 . 94 , SD = 1 . 39 ) , it was considered to be even more important for sharing results in the group ( 5 . 8 , SD = 1 . 08 , N = 15 ) . While these findings originate from the post - study questionnaire , it was also observed that not all participants did see immediate value of the documentation during the design process . Accordingly , this indicates that the value of the shared repository increases as reflection activities gain more importance toward the end of the process . Regarding the typical use of the documentation , it was found that it was not only used for reflection ( 93 . 8 % ) and reuse of results ( 75 % ) but also for specific communication and coordination tasks ( 37 . 5 % ) . For example , participants said that they used the shared documentation for distributing tasks within the group and for setting up agendas for meetings . Concerning the frequency of use , participants modified the documentation about once a week ( after meetings ) and typically checked it again before the next meeting . However , the documentation was less used during the meetings or during actual collaborative design sessions . This indicates that it was mostly used for personal reflection rather than for collaborative reflection . Concerning support for capturing relevant design knowledge , the types of artifacts collected within the shared notebooks as well as the use of client platforms were analyzed . As digital system , Evernote is capable of storing a virtual unlimited amount of design artifacts . Further , it offers several capturing mechanisms such as digital camera and scanning support that allow transferring physical artifacts to digital representations in a relatively easy way . During the design sessions , students worked with traditional design methods that mostly rely on material artifacts . However , some design material , especially within the final process stages toward a prototype was also generated with the use of digital tools such as Photoshop or software development tools and simulators . Accordingly , the most captured artifacts were within the categories of entirely digital artifacts . 81 . 3 % of the participants stated that they documented such artifacts . Further types were : typed or written text or lists ( 75 % ) , still images or scans captured from paper artifacts ( 68 . 8 % ) , typed or written questions or claims ( 56 . 3 % ) , digital diagrams or models ( 56 . 3 % ) , videos ( 50 % ) , summaries ( 25 % ) , inspirations ( 25 % ) and audio recordings ( 6 . 25 % ) . This distribution indicates that visual material ( images , sketches , text ) is most important . Further , artifacts that summarize or abstract design knowledge ( e . g . models ) were considered “landmarks” – visual and concise ways of providing structure to the documentation . For the capturing functionality , different Evernote clients were available for adding , accessing and sharing ArtifactBubbles 177 notes . The questionnaire found that participants tried most platforms ( 50 % web , 68 . 8 % desktop , 56 . 3 % mobile ) but eventually only used the desktop ( 73 . 3 % ) and web ( 26 . 7 % ) clients . The reasons for this is that the mobile apps were rarely synchronizing and that data was frequently lost due to dropped connections . Due to these technical limitations , the more stable and secure path via the desktop clients and the web access was preferred . Yet , participants stated that a functional mobile client is indeed an effective addition to the stationary clients , especially for instantly capturing and uploading physical artifacts . The organization of the documentation is related to the topic of design knowledge management and hence is of special interest for this research . During the process , participants often stated that they consider documentation activities as too effortful and as awkward . Due to the work involved in keeping the documentation , all eventually created collections can be described as rather messy , informal and unstructured . Participants mostly agreed that collaborative effort needs to be put into maintaining it ( 3 . 94 , SD = 1 . 24 ) . As a result , the students did not invest a lot of time into keeping the collection of digital artifacts organized . Only one group used the tagging functionality and found it rather useful ( 5 . 67 , SD = 1 . 53 , N = 3 ) . However , the other groups used naming schemes or summaries . The naming schemes were found to be rather unstructured , impeding the retrieval of design artifacts on demand . Rather , the timeline was heavily utilized to browse through a chronologic log of events and their corresponding results . Yet , the timeline was also considered as too stringent as it does not allow resorting or comparing artifact collections . A more flexible representation or visualization of related artifacts may improve organization . Further , some groups created notes that summarized a particular part or phase of the design process . Therefore , references to other artifacts in the repository were given . This indicates that the relation between artifacts was quite important to those participants . The search functionality of Evernote that allows retrieving artifacts based on their content ( text recognition ) or based on meta - data such as the author or location was only used by 4 students and had a rating of 5 . 0 ( SD = 1 . 83 , N = 4 ) . However , it was found that such functionality highly depends on the employed organization scheme and might also be potentially more useful for larger collections of artifacts . As meta - data was frequently missing due to a lack of automatic or manual specification , search results were mostly disappointing the participants . This finding supports previous research ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) that found that search is not a particular effective strategy to deal with informal collections of information . Rather , the informal style of organization calls for browsing methods that facilitate overview of the collection and that also permits comparisons between different related artifacts . Regarding the social aspects of the documentation activities , it was expected that social dynamics such as evaluation apprehension and free riding would have had impact on the degree of individual contribution . As the students knew that the researchers had access to the repository , participants may further fear expert judgment . However , no hesitations in archiving or sharing design material were found . Surprisingly , the students did mostly share all individually and collaboratively created artifacts ( 6 . 38 , SD = 0 . 72 ) . This however , may be due to the trust and relationship that the groups did build up during the four - month period . The students mostly agreed that they felt comfortable in their group ( 6 . 19 , SD = 1 . 42 ) , hence social factors might be more of an issue if the involved people are only loose collaborators . Additionally , the results of the design sessions were also presented to the researchers as part of the course assignments – hence they had to be shared eventually . Not surprisingly however , the use of Evernote as a stand - alone tool was not considered sufficient for all coordination tasks that are involved in collaboration . For example , other communication tools such as phone communication and email were used along other file sharing tools such as Dropbox 40 and 40 www . dropbox . com Analysis 178 Subversion 41 . When asked why Dropbox was used even though Evernote basically supports file sharing , students said that the sync feature of Evernote did not work quite as well and that it is easier to share a larger number of big files with Dropbox . This behavior may also be due to the fact that only one of the students did use Evernote before and that Dropbox is much more popular among students . Subversion was used primarily for sharing code as it supports versioning history and concurrence mechanisms , something which is of course not supported by note - taking software . To conclude , one may summarize that communication is a vital part of design and documentations cannot replace but only extend traditional means of knowledge exchange . Table 6 . 1 : Benefits and limitations of current digital design process documentation and organization practice . Benefits Limitations Externalization Support for many different types of design artifacts and contextual capture Visualizations such as lists or timelines do not care for the relations between artifacts Reflection Many artifacts can be stored and retrieved in one common representation that can be browsed for inspiration or reflection A lack of overview and spatial arrangement impedes the value of the electronic documentation for collaborative reflection activities Collaboration Distributed information storage and ubiquitous remote access Synchronization of individual contributions into one common representation is crucial Process Semi - automatic documentation augments reuse and individual reflection throughout the design process Formal and inflexible capturing and retrieving mechanisms reduce the fluency and applicability of documentation activities The results of the study indicate that the basic functionality and infrastructure of note - taking software is largely adequate for capturing design processes , but limited within the dimensions of organization and retrieval . By comparing the process with features from embodied practices ( see Table 6 . 1 ) , further limitations may become visible . For example , when considering the theme of externalization , the tool did support the creation and visualization of representations . The capturing mechanisms provided were flexible and posed no barrier to the documentation activities . However , a crucial problem was identified in the formal and inflexible nature of the linear visualization used for organizing the design documentation . More informal visualizations might be required to make the activity of externalizing the documentation more natural . This also concerns the support for reflection activities . Although the system facilitates storage and retrieval for a virtually unlimited amount of design artifacts , it lacks a visualization that is capable of conveying overview and comparisons through spatial arrangement – something that is readily available using material design artifacts on walls or whiteboards ( see section 2 . 2 . 3 ) . The list - based timeline visualization does obstruct the important embodied characteristics such as juxtaposition , manual manipulation for sense - making and overview . Within collaboration , the employed documentation tool enables distributed access to allow the sharing and retrieval of content from different locations . Nevertheless , the retrieval of design content was harmed by the messy and unstructured character of the documentation . It may be argued here that this is due to the undisciplined behavior of participants . However , it may also be considered that the effort that has to be invested in organizing such messy collections with formal meta - data such as tags is to be minimized as it would break the flow of design activities . Rather , it is argued here that more informal , more physical and more spatial ways of managing design knowledge shall be investigated to care for the collaborative activities of browsing and reflecting within design documentations . Augmented collages of design artifacts are capable of conveying overview and also the relations between artifacts through the use of spatial positioning . For the resulting process , 41 http : / / subversion . tigris . org / ArtifactBubbles 179 inadequate browsing strategies ( e . g . text - based search ) can have the effect that previous design knowledge is not available when needed , reducing the chance for reflection and reuse . Table 6 . 1 summarizes the findings regarding current documentation tool support and its limitations in relation to embodied practices . Recent related research projects such as Dazzle and Freed are first examples on how to approach new ways of documentation . Oehlberg et al . conducted a study with the tool Dazzle and found that the system failed in replacing the hands - on ( shared - physical ) characteristics involved in design meetings ( Oehlberg et al . , 2012 ) . Hence , the results are in line with the findings of this study . The authors propose more flexible visualizations such as interactive visual clusters instead of lists for future work in this context . The system Freed ( Mendels et al . , 2011 ) is an example for the benefits of more flexible ways of visualizing design artifact collections . The employed spring layout and dynamic views allow for comparisons and re - arrangements to be made . However both approaches target single users and desktop environments and are hence not suitable for collaborative , shared - physical use . 6 . 3 Design Based on the results of the previous discussed analysis , it is valuable to explore collaborative visual artifact organization strategies in more detail . Similar as in the previous case studies , the findings from the analysis are used as input to augment embodied design practices with an adequate design of supportive technology . Therefore , a focused tradeoff decision is discussed in the following that aims at implementing novel methods . 6 . 3 . 1 Tradeoff Decision As within the previous case studies , the findings from the analysis are to be used for synthesizing a design solution that addresses the conflicts between embodied practices and digital functionality . In the previous case studies , a range of tradeoffs were developed that together make up a consistent and holistic system design . Considering the scope and supplemental character of the research within this case however , it was decided that rather than constructing a system based on multiple tradeoffs , the research efforts should be concentrated to find the most suitable tradeoff among different variants . This way , the resulting tradeoff may be used within the other case studies as a replacement or addition for supporting the documentation and organization of design artifacts . Figure 6 . 3 : The goal of the desired tradeoff is to support the benefits of flexible handling , material artifacts and spatial positioning with adding computational features such as storage , retrieval and functionality such as grouping support . Figure 6 . 3 depicts the desired tradeoff . Documenting the results of design sessions or processes on whiteboards is an informal and hands - on activity that is also part of the final phase of many reality p o w e r T1 Design 180 collaborative design methods ( e . g . Affinity Diagramming , Brainsketching ) . Hence , this activity of sense - making and synthesis is to be considered as an alternative or extension to the digital only functionalities of capture and tagging . Spatial arrangements of digital artifacts might combine the benefits of both worlds . For example , an envisioned solution might have the same characteristics as current digital solutions ( e . g . storage , retrieval , sharing ) while also preserving important features of embodied practices ( e . g . direct manipulation , spatial arrangement , awareness ) . Accordingly , the desired tradeoff is a computer - supported spatial grouping technique that is to be situated in - between power and reality as balanced as possible ( see Figure 6 . 3 , right ) . This interaction technique can be used to support the synthesis and sense - making phases of design methods but also as a tool for documenting and visualizing design processes . Organizational design methods such as “Design Process Maps” ( see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) may also benefit from such informal ways of interacting and visualizing collections of design artifacts . 6 . 3 . 2 Spatial Grouping Techniques The use of informal spatial interfaces and visualizations for managing digital information is a research field of its own . Researchers have discovered great potential for better harnessing the spatial abilities of humans such as visibility , spatial memory and peripheral vision ( see section 2 . 2 . 1 ) within the design of novel interface approaches . These research investigations are all based on the assumption that humans utilize space as a way of thinking and as a tool for creating meaning ( Kirsh , 1995 ) . The characteristics of space and their value in the context of embodied design practices have already been discussed in section 2 . 2 . 1 . Accordingly , it seems promising to apply these themes to the design of digital design documentation tools as well . Shipman et al . ( 1995 ) were among the first researchers who explored the use of implicit structures for digital information organization . Based on a survey of shared - physical spatial arrangements in traditional design practices , the authors developed a set of primitive spatial structures typically used on walls or pinboards . Figure 6 . 4 : Examples of spatial structures commonly found in information collages : lists , stacks , composites , heaps ( Shipman et al . , 1995 ) . According to the researchers , the most basic primitive spatial structures used by many collaborating groups in traditional practice are lists , stacks , composites and heaps ( see Figure 6 . 4 ) ( Shipman et al . , 1995 ) . Thereby , lists are defined as aligned objects of the same type , while stacks are overlapping objects of the same type . Composites in contrast are combinations of these alignments between objects of different types . Eventually , heaps are structures without formal organization as they are defined as overlapping objects of different types . According to the authors , humans use a combination or composition of these representations to express the relations of information items in an informal , visual and haptic way . For example , the spatial structure of a heap is suitable for ambiguous and imprecise collections as it does not imply a specific relation between the items . In contrast , the structured and aligned representation of a list indicates a close relationship between the contained items ( e . g . numerical sorted or timeline ) . The flexibility that is enabled by being able to freely combine the structures , allows humans to express complex relationships in an informal way that invites re - arrangements and spatial comparisons . Within the previous case studies and especially within the affinity diagramming technique , such spatial representations were an integral feature to a ArtifactBubbles 181 collaborative sense - making process . However , it is to be explored if spatial arrangements may also be used for documentation purposes . In contrast to informal physical collections like the spatial structures described above , digital information collections are often represented in formal ways such as lists , folders and grids . This is due to the nature of files systems that are hierarchically organized within named files and folders . Information items are visualized using placeholders ( e . g . icons , thumbnails ) and are typically enclosed in a spatially constrained container ( e . g . folder , desktop ) . As a consequence , humans are not able to harness the flexibility spatial arrangements yield in information organization and categorization . Visualizing ambiguous relations between information artifacts or comparing two representations side - by - side is thus much harder than in physical practice . However , using digital information management , humans gain powerful functionality such as the ability to move or copy multiple items at the same time , which is not possible with physical material . Figure 6 . 5 : Interfaces for spatial information management : Data Mountain ( left ) , Dynapad ( center ) , Bubble Clusters ( right ) . Researchers have investigated solutions for combining spatial layouts with digital information organization functionalities . For example , in the context of desktop interfaces , researchers have explored alternative ways for organizing information beyond the traditional files and folders structure of the WIMP paradigm . In particular , researchers were interested in interaction techniques and visualizations for supporting spatial information management on mouse - operated displays . In the following , some remarkable concepts in this domain are reviewed . For a more comprehensive assessment of spatial grouping techniques , see Höchtl ( 2012 ) . In one of the earliest research efforts , Robertson et al . presented the Data Mountain , an interface designed for organizing document thumbnails spatially on a three - dimensional landscape ( see Figure 6 . 5 , left ) ( G . Robertson et al . , 1998 ) . It allows the placement of artifacts within the 3D space and thereby supports overlapping items and free - form arrangements . Although the third dimension used in Data Mountain is beneficial for flexibly arranging artifacts in space , it considerably increases the complexity . Dynapad ( Bauer , Fastrez , & Hollan , 2005 ) in contrast provides spatial tools for managing information collections within a zoomable user interface similar to Pad + + ( Bederson & Hollan , 1994 ) . Here , the third dimension of scale allows users to position representations within free - form arrangements and containers ( see Figure 6 . 5 , center ) . Compared to Data Mountain , the ZUI approach improves the visibility and comparability of information items as it presents a full view rather than a thumbnail . Yet , it requires spatial navigation within the different interface scales . Dynapad supports two different types of containers , namely clumps and trays . Clumps can be used to create composites of loose arrangements , while the tray is a grid for sorting items based on their meta - data such as time and type . While these interface concepts focused on the representation , other interaction techniques such as Bubble Clusters ( Watanabe , Washida , & Igarashi , 2007 ) focus on the interaction with collections of digital artifacts . The Bubble Clusters concept automatically recognizes groups within aggregations of artifacts and surrounds these groups with a bubble - like shape ( see Figure 6 . 5 , right ) . Using such an Design 182 informal way of spatial organization , the concept combines the power of traditional spatial flexibility with the benefits of digital manipulation such as grouping . While the other interface variants require the selection of multiple items for moving and grouping , the bubble clusters concept automatically selects items that are in close proximity to each other , making interaction more fluent . To summarize , the described interfaces have their unique benefits that may be combined for use within this research . However , all presented concepts were designed for use on desktop interfaces only . However , for use in embodied collaborative design practices , a suitable technique additionally needs to focus on tangible and hands - on manipulation . Only recently , novel concepts for supporting grouping and categorizing of information on interactive surfaces emerged . Multi - touch interaction bears great potential for supporting the manipulation of individual items and groups more efficiently than it is possible with traditional single pointer desktop interfaces . Hence , it is especially suitable for fluent manual categorizing of information items . Further , when the mapping between gesture and action becomes more direct , users can make more use of their spatial memory capabilities and it is easier to move and remember objects ( Kirsh , 1995 ) . Nevertheless , due to the rich affordances of touch interfaces , it is possible to manipulate virtual objects and groups of objects with not only one hand ( as in mouse - operated desktop interfaces ) , but with two hands and multiple fingers , thereby making interaction more analogous to physical interactions in the non - digital world . Researchers within interactive surface design have empirically examined the benefits of digital and physical affordances ( Terrenghi , 2007 ) , gestures for typical tasks and commands ( Wobbrock , Morris , & Wilson , 2009 ) and bimanual gestures for moving and grouping items ( North , Dwyer , Lee , Fisher , & Isenberg , 2009 ; Tse et al . , 2008 ) . Besides the investigation of grouping gestures , researchers have also created interaction techniques especially for grouping items spatially on interactive tabletops . Traditionally , multi - selection and grouping tasks on desktop interfaces are supported by group selection methods such as rubber banding or lasso selection , before operations ( e . g . move into container ) are applied to the selected group . This method of group selection and drag & drop style operations was also carried over to interactive surfaces . Examples for this can be found in research and practice . For example , Scott et al . presented the interaction technique Storage Bins for supporting information management on interactive tabletops ( see Figure 6 . 6 , left ) ( Scott , Carpendale , & Habelski , 2005 ) . The concept is an extension of the classical folder metaphor . Objects can be dragged into a movable and resizable container . Once the object is contained by the container shape , it is resized into a smaller representation to visualize its containment . The containers themselves can be moved to other locations on the interactive surface , thereby preserving the spatial layout of the objects inside the container . The container itself can also be resized as to care for more objects . Therefore , handles similar to those used within pen - based graphical user interfaces , provide tools for manipulation of the container shape . The container concept as demonstrated in Storage Bins is the de - facto state - of - the - art method of grouping items on interactive surfaces . Its basic principle is used within many different applications and is also a standard - element of most software development environments for touch interfaces ( e . g . Microsoft Surface SDK ) . Today , commercial frameworks provide components such as Surface SDK’s Library Container 42 that support containment - based grouping ( see Figure 6 . 6 , right ) . Some more innovative concepts based on containment are interaction techniques based on piles or multimodal selection and grouping based on gestures and speech ( Tse et al . , 2008 ) . For example , the BumpTop system ( Agarawala & Balakrishnan , 2006 ) augmented the traditional desktop interface with three - dimensional piles and stacks and also implemented a physics simulation . Later , the system was extended for use on multi - touch devices . Yet , it relies on traditional grouping concepts based on containment . 42 http : / / msdn . microsoft . com / en - us / library / ff727879 . aspx ArtifactBubbles 183 Research has still to investigate if grouping techniques based on proximity ( e . g . Bubble Clusters ) are also suitable for supporting spatial grouping on interactive surfaces . Figure 6 . 6 : Spatial grouping techniques on interactive surfaces are using the container metaphor . Storage Bins ( left ) , Microsoft Surface Library Container ( right ) . To summarize , a review of existing spatial grouping techniques revealed that there are two fundamental concepts for supporting spatial sense - making with interaction techniques : grouping based on containment , and grouping based on proximity . While the former is well established on desktop interfaces and was already adapted for use on interactive surfaces , the latter was only studied on a desktop interface using single - pointer mouse - operation . For the design of the desired tradeoff for supporting sense - making and categorization of design artifacts within design methods and for documentation support , it is hence valuable to explore the differences and individual benefits or drawbacks of both concepts in the context of manual manipulation on interactive surfaces . With an investigation of both concepts using an experimental user study , an informed tradeoff may be decided upon . Based on the previously discussed characteristics of the application domain ( see section 2 . 2 ) , it is to be examined which concept is more suitable based on the following requirements : R1 : The spatial grouping technique is desired to provide a flexible layout supporting typical spatial structures ( see section 6 . 1 ) , such as lists , composites , piles and heaps . R2 : The spatial grouping technique is desired to provide fluent interaction in grouping and sorting tasks , such as different natural strategies of arranging items . R3 : The spatial grouping technique is desired to harness the benefits of multi - touch and bi - manual interaction , such as the effective use of multiple fingers and both hands . R4 : The spatial grouping technique is desired to be useful for visualizing abstract concepts and relations between design artifacts . Based on these requirements , spatial grouping techniques for each approach were designed for explicit use on interactive surfaces . Both interaction concepts will be briefly presented in the following . Interface Variant 1 : Bin – Grouping based on Containment As a first interface variant , a container technique based on Storage Bins ( Scott et al . , 2005 ) , was designed . The concept , which will be referred to as “Bin” , is an adaptation of the Storage Bins Design 184 interaction technique that focuses on supporting the above described requirements . It utilizes mobile and adjustable containers for storing and retrieving digital items on an interactive surface . Therefore , in contrast to the original Storage Bin technique , the classical concept of containment was extended by including eight handles which allow adjusting Bin’s shape ( see Figure 6 . 7 ) . Further , the manipulation of the shape can also be used to include items . Users can add items to Bin and may freely arrange them within the boundaries . Thus , all previous described spatial arrangements are feasible . Users may also move Bin itself by dragging it to a new location . The concept provides several ways of interaction as described in the following : Dragging objects into a Bin : The user may either drag or toss an object directly into a Bin . When the item is released inside , it is resized as to show that it is now contained by the Bin . ( c . f . drag & drop ) Lasso selection : Users may also select a group of objects with a lasso selection and may then move this temporary collection into the Bin . After releasing the collection , objects are added to the Bin . Collecting objects : The Bin itself can also be used to collect items . Therefore , users can drag the shape directly over objects or adjust the shape of Bin by dragging its handles . After releasing the shape or its handles , objects inside Bin’s boundaries are resized to visualize containment . Spreading objects : When objects overlap within Bin , users may use a pinching gesture for getting an overview on the contents . When applying this gesture , objects are slightly moved so that no overlapping items remain . Figure 6 . 7 : Interface variant Bin : grouping based on containment . The Bin technique addresses all requirements for potential application within the domain of sense - making and design documentation as described above . As objects within Bin are not aligned within a particular structure , the user is free to position the contents as desired . Thus it supports flexible spatial layouts ( R1 ) . Users may freely add and remove items by simply dragging them with their fingers . This can be done using different strategies ( e . g . dragging or collecting ) as well as with multiple fingers and both hands at the same time . Accordingly , the technique cares for the requirements on fluent interaction and also seeks to harness the benefits of direct hands - on manipulation on interactive surfaces ( R2 , R3 ) . Due to its support for free - form layouts and shape manipulation , it also enables users to customize its representation for visualizing abstract concepts ( R4 ) . Interface Variant 2 : Bubble – Grouping based on Proximity As a second interface variant , which will be referred to as “Bubble” , a grouping technique based on the proximity concept was desired . Therefore , the interaction technique Bubble Clusters ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) was adapted for use on interactive surfaces . In contrast to the container technique , the interface does not provide pre - defined containers . Rather , each object is surrounded by a bubble ArtifactBubbles 185 shape which adjusts its boundaries according the number and positions of objects in close proximity ( see Figure 6 . 8 ) . The concept hence provides following ways of organizing items : Group by object : Two items join one Bubble if they are positioned close to each other . To do so , the user drags an object to another object and as soon as their boundaries touch each other , the bubble shapes melt , creating a new , larger Bubble . ( c . f . drag & drop ) Group by Bubble : Users can also move Bubbles by dragging the bubble shape to a new position . After releasing it , overlapping items or other Bubbles are merged , when applicable . Splitting a Bubble : Users may also split Bubble by drawing a stroke with the finger across the bubble shape . The Bubble then splits and two new bubble shapes result . Spreading objects : When objects overlap within Bubble , users may use a pinching gesture for getting an overview on the contents . When applying this gesture , objects are slightly moved so that no overlapping items remain . This technique is equivalent to the functionality found in Bin . Figure 6 . 8 : Interface Variant Bubble : grouping based on proximity . Like the Bin technique , the Bubble concept addresses all desired requirements for the application domain . Objects may be freely arranged within a bubble shape , hence supporting flexible spatial layout such as lists , stacks , composites and piles ( R1 ) . The concept also supports fluent interaction as it provides several ways of clustering items using either group by object strategies or “Group by Bubble” strategies ( R2 ) . Additionally , the concept offers the ability to split Bubbles , increasing the complexity of the interface – but also enabling alternative strategies that are not feasible with the container concept . Eventually , it also supports the use of multiple fingers and both hands , which allows for harnessing the potential benefit s of multi - touch and bimanual interaction ( R3 ) . Using the technique , users are able to create arbitrary arrangements and thus may visualize abstract concepts using the spatial layout and the bubble shapes ( R4 ) . 6 . 4 Evaluation For evaluation and comparison of the concepts , a hybrid approach was desired that produces knowledge about the interaction techniques as abstract concepts but also about their suitability for application within the domain of sense - making and design process documentation . This however cannot be achieved within a single user study . When studying both techniques within a real collaborative sense - making procedure , the accompanying activities involved in reflecting , thinking and group communication will make it impossible to compare both techniques on any isolated measure of performance . Further , when studying both techniques without reference to the application domain , findings are applicable to many different situations and thus may also be useful for researchers working in other domains . Thus , an experimental setup involving an artificial task is desired to compare the general characteristics of both techniques in detail . However , on the other Evaluation 186 hand , such an experiment will not allow making inferences on requirements that are directly related to the application domain . In the case at hand , it is to be examined if the concept is suitable for visualizing abstract concepts and relations between design artifacts ( R4 ) . Accordingly , an additional contextual user study involving an actual collaborative documentation and sense - making task with the use of real design artifacts is desired . As such a hybrid approach is inevitably more complex than a single user study , it was decided that the evaluation approach would be composed of three consecutive steps : Comparative experiment : within an initial user study , both techniques will be compared on measures of performance using an abstract task . Selection : The findings regarding the abstract requirements ( R1 , R2 , R3 ) will be used to select the most promising tradeoff for subsequent application to the domain . This will allow concentrating further investigations on one technique only . Contextual user study : within a second user study , the selected technique will be studied within a realistic task that is closely related to the goal of supporting documentation and sense - making activities in design practice . The findings then primarily contribute to an understanding of the usefulness of the technique for visualizing abstract concepts ( R4 ) . Figure 6 . 9 : Evaluation approach : comparative experiment , comparison , selection and contextual case study . Figure 6 . 9 depicts this evaluation procedure and also provides an overview on the contents of the following chapters . In a first step toward approaching the user studies , both interface variants were implemented for use on interactive surfaces . To care for adoption of the interaction techniques in other prototypes , the grouping techniques were integrated into the ZOIL framework , which is also used in the other prototypes developed within this research ( see Chapters 4 , 5 ) . Hence , as rather abstract interaction techniques , they may be used for replacing currently used techniques such as those used for clustering in the AffinityTable prototype . Therefore , components of the Surface SDK were adapted and customized for supporting the above described interaction methods . The basic visualization and interaction concepts of Bin were created from scratch , while the visualization of the Bubble technique was implemented from the existing references and algorithms ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) . bin concept case study artificial task realistic task multi - user observation experimental user study contextual user study bubble concept single user performance measures artificial task single - user performance measures comparison & selection tradeoff decision ArtifactBubbles 187 More details on the technical aspects of the implementation are available within a technical report ( Höchtl , 2012 ) . 6 . 4 . 1 Comparative Experiment According to the presented evaluation approach , a comparative experiment was designed that focused on the examination of the qualities both interaction techniques yield as abstract concepts . Therefore , a controlled user study involving an artificial task and measures of performance was desired . For the sake of controllability and validity , it was also decided that a single - user setup seems to be most promising for controlling and isolating influences on performance . As measures of performance , the characteristics of both techniques in regard to fluent interaction ( R2 ) and their potential for harnessing the benefits of multi - touch and bimanual interaction ( R3 ) were focused . By combining both findings , the comparative experiment is expected to provide a foundation for selecting the most promising technique for the contextual user study . Study Design The experiment was designed to be performed on a Microsoft Surface table , measuring 24” x 18” with 1024 x 768 px screen resolution ( see Figure 6 . 10 ) . The table was situated in a controlled environment within the usability lab on the local university campus . Data collection was performed through the use of questionnaires , structured interviews , video - recordings and logging data . Twelve participants ( seven male and five female , age 21 to 39 , mean : 26 ) were recruited for the study from the local university campus . All of the participants passed a color - blindness test prior to the experiment . With the exception of two individuals , the participants did not have backgrounds in computer science . However , only one participant had never used a touch device before . Participants were compensated for their efforts with a small amount of money . For the experimental setup , a counterbalanced within - subjects design was selected . Each condition was introduced to the participants prior to each test run by a short description supplied on a paper sheet and a short tutorial and practice . Each condition was then tested in sessions that lasted approximately 20 minutes . The whole procedure took around 60 minutes per participant . Figure 6 . 10 : Both interface variants , Bin ( left ) and Bubble ( right ) , were implemented for use on interactive surfaces such as the Microsoft Surface . Evaluation 188 The tasks , representations and number of objects were selected as a replication of a similar study ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) . Accordingly , users were given the abstract tasks to group 30 spatially distributed rectangles according to five different colors . Each trial covered a grouping and a regrouping phase : 1 ) Initially , the rectangles appear distributed on the surface in random positioning . In the Bin condition , five Bins are positioned randomly on the screen using a minimum size . 2 ) Users are then asked to group the shapes according to their colors as fast as possible ( grouping ) . 3 ) After a five second break , the colors of the shapes are randomly shuffled and participants are asked to group the objects again ( regrouping ) . The whole experiment consisted of sixteen trials ( 4 passes x 2 interface conditions x 2 phases ) , whereby the first pass was excluded from data analysis as it was used for a short tutorial and free practice . In order to avoid carry - over effects , six participants started with the Bin condition and the other six started with the Bubble condition . Results The data analysis focused on the requirements of fluent interaction ( R2 ) and in which extent the techniques were able to harness the benefits of multi - touch and bimanual interaction ( R3 ) . The first aspect was measured based on the differences both concept exhibit in grouping and regrouping performance , user preferences and the structure of grouping strategies used within the tasks . The second aspect was measured based on the extent the participants utilized both hands and multiple fingers during the tasks . Figure 6 . 11 : Average task completion times for both interface variants . Bubble became increasingly faster across the passes . The participants were generally able to complete the grouping tasks with both interfaces . This was measured by logging the task completion times of each trial . 94 % of all trials with the Bubble interface and 99 % of all trials with the Bin interface were successfully completed within a five minute limit . This indicates that both variants did work reasonably well for the grouping task . Figure 6 . 11 depicts the average task completion times for both interfaces across both conditions . Logged task completion times differed between Bin and Bubble . Paired t - tests for the grouping phase depicted significant differences between both techniques ( t ( 12 ) = 0 . 00063 , p < 0 . 001 ) with Bubble being faster . However , performance within the regrouping phase showed only slight variations . By interacting with the Bubble technique , participants had a tendency to become faster across the passes 174 175 173 157 130 108 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 1 2 3 s e c BIN BLUB Expon .

The average task completion times differed in 49 seconds between the first and the third pass ( 31 % improvement ) . However , user performance remained almost constant in the Bin condition . From the results of the two standardized questionnaires SUS ( Brooke , 1996 ) and AttrakDiff ( Hassenzahl , Burmester , & Koller , 2003 ) , as well as the interview data , it was evident that participants clearly preferred the Bubble technique . Participants consistently stated that they found Bubble to be more attractive and would like to use it more frequently than Bin . Further , the latter was found to be more cumbersome to use . Although Bin was described as more motivating , all but one participant preferred Bubble . Participants described the technique as being more practical , innovative and stimulating . Based on a qualitative video analysis and an analysis of logged event data , differences in the participants grouping behavior were examined for explaining the performance effects . As a result , distinct interaction strategies were identified . It was found that the participant’s behavior could mostly be separated into two basic steps – a preparation step and a grouping step . In the Bin condition , participants often prepared the rectangle shapes by accumulating them in small heaps by either dragging or tossing them to spatial groups . After this preparation , containers and handles were arranged as to contain the objects within the boundaries . In the regrouping phase , participants often enlarged the container shape and dragged overlapping shapes apart in order to get a better overview . For the grouping itself , participants dragged or tossed objects into a Bin , from Bin to Bin or used the lasso for collecting items . Another strategy was to collect the accumulated shapes by dragging a container over them or by adjusting a Bin’s shape to enclose objects . The proximity based concept of Bubble however provided less freedom in interaction as its boundaries are not adjustable . Based on this difference , participants spent less time on preparation but rather directly engaged in grouping . During grouping , they mostly dragged objects to same - colored accumulations in a target - oriented way or tossed them to a point at the edge of the display for rough pre - clustering . Another less frequent strategy was to create a large bubble of objects and then splitting it based on colored clusters . In both interface variants , participants however hardly used the pinching gesture in order to get a better overview of overlapping objects . But when they did , they did so mainly in the regrouping phase . Concerning the effectiveness of both techniques on a multi - touch surface , the video and logging data was coded for investigating the differences concerning bimanual and multi - touch input between the interfaces . Therefore , 71 successful trials with the Bin technique and 68 successful trials with the Bubble technique were qualitatively analyzed using the video material . Each trial of both conditions was coded based on the use of one - handed and two - handed interaction as well as single finger and multiple finger interaction . Interactions such as lasso selection and bubble splitting which explicitly require the use of multiple fingers or both hands were excluded from this analysis . Figure 6 . 12 depicts the results of this analysis for all trials in order of occurrence in the user study . None of the participants ( T1 to T12 ) had one preferred way of interacting across both interfaces . Only one subject ( T1 ) kept to one interaction strategy in both conditions . Most participants adapted their interaction between the trials and between grouping and regrouping phases . Four participants ( T3 , T6 , T9 and T12 ) tried different combinations in the first interface , but eventually decided for one strategy in the second condition . In contrary , one participant ( T11 ) tried different strategies in the second condition only . Overall , all subjects tried different combinations between two patterns ( N = 4 ) , three patterns ( N = 4 ) or all four patterns ( N = 4 ) . Evaluation 190 Figure 6 . 12 : Participant ' s use of bimanual and multi - finger interaction in trials with Bubble ( A ) and Bin ( B ) . Figure 6 . 13 : Interaction patterns with one or both hands and one or multiple fingers in the grouping and regrouping phases . Figure 6 . 13 shows the percentages of interaction patterns for both interfaces . Two - handed interaction with multiple fingers was especially applied in the Bubble condition ( 41 . 2 % ) whereas one hand and multiple fingers ( 35 . 2 % ) as well as both hands with one finger each ( 31 % ) was more often used in the Bin condition ( Figure 6 . 13 , top ) . The analysis also revealed that participants used multiple fingers more often in the grouping phase than in the regrouping phase in both conditions . Bimanual use of multiple fingers was used most often ( 47 . 1 % ) in the grouping phase of the Bubble condition ( Figure 6 . 13 , bottom ) . Discussion The results of the experiment revealed significant differences between both interfaces in task performance within the grouping task . Especially within the situation of grouping randomly distributed artifacts , the Bubble technique clearly outperformed the Bin technique .

For example , within affinity diagramming , notes are synthesized from arbitrary locations into a common structure . Within such activities , there is typically no pre - defined structure readily available . Hence , the opportunistic interaction strategies used within the Bubble condition seem to be a better fit compared to the pre - determined container positions required by the Bin technique . For example , within affinity diagramming , categories and clusters emerge as the sorting activities progress and thus there is no pre - defined structure available . In the regrouping phase , no differences in performance between both interface variants were evident . This however is of less interest in regard to the application domain , as regrouping scenarios are less intense in sense - making activities . As a result , on a measure of performance , the Bubble technique seems promising for application within the domain of design tool support . This conclusion is further supported by findings on user preference and interaction strategies . In the Bin condition , participants spent more time on planning their moves rather than directly interacting in an opportunistic way . Thus , the technique is more suitable for structured tasks . In contrast , the Bubble technique seems to stimulate a more direct approach as there is no need for extensive planning . Hence , it is more suitable for tasks involving incremental formalization . The results of the qualitative analysis indicated that the differences in performance are at least partly due to increased use of bimanual interaction in combination with multiple fingers in the Bubble condition . However , similar behavior was not observed in the regrouping phase . One possible explanation for this is that the grouping phase more closely resembles tasks that are prevalent in everyday life ( like sorting randomly distributed photos or cards ) , while the regrouping task was more artificial ( sorting based on existing groups ) ( Kirsh , 1995 ) . Likewise , participants could make more use of their natural behavior in the grouping task . Participants also confirmed that the Bubble technique is more natural and easier to understand . It may be argued that this is due to the differences in affordances both interfaces yield . While the Bin technique seems to make users carry over single - pointer interaction strategies from the desktop - world , the Bubble technique is entirely different , not pointing the users to the reuse of existing strategies . For example , a particular efficient strategy was observed in moving multiple dispersed objects with both hands to a central location . Although this strategy is also possible in the Bin condition , participants applied it mostly in the Bubble condition . The organic nature of the Bubble interface emphasizes simultaneous merging operations rather than drag & drop and thus allows users to make more flexible use of space for planning and conducting grouping tasks . Considering all findings of the study together , the experiment showed that the proximity concept of grouping is more beneficial for grouping tasks on a digital surface than the traditional container concept . Participants interacted more often with multiple fingers and both hands , which depicts that grouping based on proximity is capable of harnessing more advantages of bimanual and multi - touch interaction than grouping based on containment . Technique Selection By reflecting the results of the comparative study , it is clear that the Bubble technique represents a more adequate tradeoff between power ( augmented grouping functionality ) and reality ( natural affordances ) than the Bin technique . It is superior to the Bin concept in both dimensions of the power vs . reality continuum ( see Figure 6 . 14 ) as it offers more performance by being perceived as more natural and intuitive at the same time . Further , the benefits of the technique were especially visible within the grouping phase of the experimental setup , which closely relates to potential scenarios of use in the application domain . Evaluation 192 Figure 6 . 14 : Grouping based on proximity was found to be closer to reality , by offering more power at the same time . The concept of grouping based on proximity exemplified by the Bubble technique indicates to be especially suitable for supporting sense - making tasks within the application domain . Its open and flexible character stimulated ad - hoc grouping rather than planning strategies , which better supports informal information organization practices that are typically found in design practice ( see section 2 . 2 ) . Hence , it is reasonable to further adapt and refine this technique for investigating its effectiveness within a typical situation or activity in collaborative design . Accordingly , it is selected as candidate for further study in the following contextual user study . 6 . 4 . 2 Contextual User Study Based on the previous devised evaluation methodology , the goal of the second user study is to study the suitability of the Bubble technique in the context of design process documentation and visualization . In the previous chapter , spatial grouping techniques were proposed as a solution for addressing the issue of informal visualization in the context of design artifact collections and documentation . It is hence to examine if spatial grouping is indeed a suitable approach for supporting collaborative design reflection activities . Hence , the context of this user study is defined as the activity of reflecting upon a design process by using interactive grouping techniques as visualizations . This can also be seen as a methodic approach which explicitly emphasizes the activity of reflection . For example , the design method “Design Process Maps” is documented as an isolate method for reflecting a design process by using collages of information on walls ( see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) . The objective of the study described in this chapter is in particular to investigate if and how the Bubble technique supports such activities when practiced in a realistic collaborative situation . For simulating such a situation , two basic scenarios are possible . One the one hand , reflection and visualization may occur as one step of a design method such as at the end of affinity diagramming or sketching sessions , when artifacts are clustered into groups for discussion and documentation . On the other hand , it may also be practiced as an independent method such as in the Design Process Maps methodology . For empirical study , both approaches require the integration of the grouping technique into a workflow and into a digital design tool . In the first case , it would be possible to adapt and integrate the Bubble technique into the AffinityTable or IdeaVis prototype . However , this would involve a user study that includes many other steps of the respective design method workflow . Because documentation , reflection and visualization are then intertwined with other process steps , it is a rather complex setting for a user study . Accordingly , it was decided that a more suitable approach would be to integrate the grouping technique into a dedicated design process reflection tool that can be used isolated from other workflows based on a collection of design knowledge artifacts that were previously produced in some kind of methodic process . As such , the tool does explicitly exclude the creation of artifacts and rather serves as abstract visualization for reflective documentation . Using this approach , the visualization can be studied based on this particular activity , which reduces the effort in reality p o w e r Containment Proximity ArtifactBubbles 193 isolating other influences . For the purpose of this empirical study , such a digital tool called ArtifactBubbles was implemented for supporting this scenario . ArtifactBubbles ArtifactBubbles is a prototype tool implemented especially for the purpose of this user study . It integrates an adapted implementation of the Bubble technique for use with image artifacts on large wall displays ( see Figure 6 . 15 ) . It utilizes the same basic interaction concept as demonstrated in the previous user study . Yet , instead of abstract colored shapes it features visual images that represent various design artifacts such as photos , sketches and other digital representations . These images are not created within the tool , but are rather retrieved from an existing digital design artifact repository such as Evernote . The tool essentially provides an interactive , spatial visualization of artifacts stored in such repositories . It provides a zoomable canvas that cares for a large number of artifacts ( 120 + ) and that can be navigated with zooming and panning operations . Further , the system is explicitly designed to care for situations of collaborative use where multiple people may interact at the same time . Using the interface , a group of designers is able to create rich collage - like visualizations from a collection of design artifacts . Figure 6 . 15 : ArtifactBubbles is a design process reflection tool based on spatial grouping and visualization . The ArtifactBubbles prototype supports following interactions : Design artifacts can be manipulated in their position , size , and rotation . Resizing artifacts is supported by pinching gestures on the artifacts . When resizing artifacts , a maximum and minimum size is enforced to avoid accidental blocking of other artifacts . Artifacts can be aligned by using rotation gestures with multiple fingers . The position of artifacts is controlled by dragging and flicking gestures . When artifacts are moved on the canvas , they do not collide with other artifacts . Rather , the artifacts are virtually lifted from the surface using the visual cue of a drop - shadow . Accordingly , the artifacts can be easily moved across other objects without influencing their position or alignment . Evaluation 194 Multiple artifacts can be moved at the same time by multiple people or by individuals using multiple hands and fingers . This way , artifacts can be arranged using a hands - on - approach similar to the real situation of sorting photographs on a table surface . This includes the ability to overlap multiple artifacts spatially . All artifacts are associated with surrounding bubbles . The bubbles are used for grouping and clustering . As within the experimental user study , the Bubble technique supports group - by - object as well as group - by - bubble for supporting the grouping of artifacts and artifact clusters . Individual artifacts can be grouped by dragging them into close proximity with others which leads to the merging of two bubbles . However , clustering may also be done using the bubble shape which then allows the grouping of clusters . The canvas can be navigated by zooming and panning operations . Hence , by applying dragging and pinching gestures to the canvas , the virtual view onto the artifacts may be enlarged or minimized . The view can be enlarged without any constraints ( detail view ) , but may only be minimized up to the constraints determined by the size of the canvas ( overview ) . The Bubble technique was adapted for use within the ArtifactBubbles system by refining its functionality . Based on the results of the previous study , the functionalities for spreading and splitting bubbles were removed . Both features were not used frequently during the experimental user study and did not significantly contribute to the results . The splitting functionality was further found to be rather unsuitable for collaborative use as it would require a mode switch between handling the canvas for navigation purposes and between using finger gestures for splitting bubbles . Accordingly , the Bubble technique got even simpler , further reducing its complexity . At the same time however , the Bubble technique was technically extended to support differently - sized objects and arbitrary rotation of objects . ArtifactBubbles was designed to support the visualization of design artifact collections through manual arrangement and layout on a large high - resolution wall display . It aims at addressing limitations of current formal digital information management practices such as folders , lists , and timelines ( see section 5 . 1 ) by proving more flexibility , expressivity and fluency . The design hence focuses on providing the benefits of spatial information management : visualization of overview , comparison , juxtaposition and semantic relations as well as the benefits of informal interaction : fluency , ambiguity , directness and visual feedback . It however does not aim at providing functionality that is already supported by note - taking applications such as capture , retrieval and manipulation . Accordingly , ArtifactBubbles can be understood as another “view” onto visual design artifact collections rather than a self - contained application . For the user study that will be described in the following , ArtifactBubbles was integrated with the Evernote workflow by the ability to drag & drop images stored in Evernote notebooks into the ArtifactBubbles canvas . Study Design A user study was performed with the goal to investigate the use of ArtifactBubbles for supporting collaborative reflection activities . It was situated in a controlled environment within the usability lab on campus which provides several interactive high - resolution displays . Four groups of students ( n = 10 , 9 male , 1 female ; three dyads and one triad ) were recruited from the participants of an interaction design course . The subjects were among the same students that originally participated in the exploratory user study that focused on design process documentation ( see section 6 . 2 . 1 ) . Therefore , all students had already worked together in a team for about four months and had already documented an entire design process with the tool Evernote as part of the previous course activities . Documented artifacts included all results of the design phases analysis , modeling , design and ArtifactBubbles 195 prototyping such as field data and statistics , early sketches , visual models like use cases and screenshots of prototypes . As all groups documented their design process with Evernote , the artifacts were available as digital image files . Participants were participating voluntarily and were compensated with a small amount of money . None of the students took part in the previous described comparative study and none of the students ever used the Bubble technique prior to the study . The study took place about four months after the design process . This was planned with the intention to create a collaborative situation of reflection upon past activities and their results ( reflection - on - action ) . The technical setting was based on a large , standing - height vertical multi - touch wall display measuring 76cm x 162cm with 4K resolution ( 4096px x 2160px ) . For an initial tutorial of the Bubble technique , a second interactive multi - touch display was available measuring 62cm x 108cm featuring Full HD resolution ( 1920px x 1080px ) . Both displays featured optical touch recognition with frame layover techniques . The study procedure was initiated by a short explanation and introduction of the interaction technique . Therefore , ArtifactBubbles was available on the smaller interactive display . The application was pre - loaded with 15 sample images . This methodology was chosen in order to explain the technique to participants without reference to the application domain . Following features were demonstrated by the principal investigator : moving artifacts , rotating artifacts , scaling artifacts , clustering artifacts , moving multiple artifacts and clusters , grouping clusters and navigating by zooming and panning . After the short demonstration , participants had the opportunity to try out the interaction techniques for themselves . This free practice session was also used for clarifying the abstract concept of the grouping technique . After practice , the small display was turned off and participants were introduced to the large display that was pre - loaded with the artifacts the groups documented during their design processes using Evernote . The artifacts were displayed in random order around the border of the canvas ( see Figure 6 . 16 , left ) . Figure 6 . 16 : ArtifactBubbles study setting . Design artifacts from Evernote were loaded onto the canvas in random order ( left ) . Participants were given the task to create a spatial map of their design process ( right ) . Participants of the study were then given the task to collaboratively reflect upon the design process they experienced during the previous interaction design course . The task was split into two consecutive assignments : Task 1 : “Reflect upon your design process from last semester’s course – try to remember activities , meetings , results and milestones . ” Task 2 : “Arrange all artifacts on the canvas with the goal to create a map of your design process – use the map for presenting and discussing your process . ” Evaluation 196 The task descriptions were delivered verbally by the principal investigator but were also available to the participants on a supplied paper sheet . Thereafter , participants engaged in the tasks until they were satisfied with the results and agreed on one representation for presentation . The task duration was in average 40 minutes , while the whole procedure took about 1 ½ hours per group . After completion of the task , participants briefly presented their results to an invited individual that was not involved in the design process . Concluding the study , a short focus group was conducted by the principle investigator to elicit feedback from the participants . The emphases of the focus group questions were on the usefulness and limitations of the tool in relation to the task . During the study , two researchers collected data in the form of video recordings , structured observation notes , focus group interview recordings as well as pre - timed screen captures . The data was then analyzed based on the methodology of qualitative content analysis ( Mayring , 2000 ) . For doing so , seven exploratory questions regarding the appropriation of the interaction technique were posed for guiding the analysis : How do the groups proceed during the task ? This relates to interaction strategies and task organization . How is the general layout and alignment of artifacts used for visualizing the design process ? This regards the position , rotation , size and distance of individual objects and their potential overlap . Which attributes of the artifacts such as time of creation , perceived quality , importance or type are mapped to the properties of the layout ? How are the visual properties of individual bubble shapes such as distribution of objects , distance between contained objects , closeness , size and form used for visualization ? Which structures such as lists , stacks , categories , hierarchies or timelines emerge from the visualization ? How does the tool affect the communication behavior of participants such as verbal communication , gestures and deictic references ? How does the tool affect social protocols such as roles , turn - taking , planning , joint navigation and distribution of work ? In addition to these questions , the general usability and appropriateness of the tool for this particular task was studied based on the participant’s feedback . The analysis was conducted by the principal researcher using the video material and the screenshots as primary resources . Therefore , evidence was collected by scanning over four hours of video material and by analyzing the focus group interviews . Results & Discussion Regarding the overall proceedings of the reflection sessions , a clear pattern of one particular interaction strategy emerged . If was found that the groups naturally progressed through four subsequent phases : Browsing Planning and pre - sorting Sorting within clusters Aligning clusters on the canvas . ArtifactBubbles 197 The beginning of the sessions was characterized by an initial browsing activity which can be described as rather focused on navigation rather than manipulation . Participants zoomed in and out of the canvas to examine artifacts in detail . Then , they moved on to other artifacts either by panning or by zooming out to an overview and zooming back in . This was mostly accompanied with discussion or clarification of the events and activities that were bound to these artifacts . The navigation proved to be a collaborative activity requiring coordination . Mostly , one person of the teams emerged as responsible for navigation while others were communicating with this person as proxy for navigation . One may explain this behavior by the fact that zooming and panning can effectively only be used by one person at a time as the employed gestures such as pinching and dragging affect the whole workspace . The browsing activity was closed once the groups felt that they remembered and understood the context that was provided by the artifacts . After browsing , a planning and pre - sorting phase occurred in which participants planned the next steps and prepared the sorting or grouping of artifacts . Different strategies of doing so were examined and discussed in the groups . Due to the random placement of artifacts , finding and moving related artifacts into a cluster required cross - display movements . To avoid this , most groups started with a rough sorting of related artifacts that were already positioned nearby . Then , these clusters were joined with other , more distant clusters . This finding resonates with the results of the experimental user study ( see section 6 . 4 . 1 ) , which identified this incremental approach as key to efficiency in grouping tasks . Thereby , it occasionally occurred that artifacts or clusters had to be moved across other objects on the canvas . While generally effective in single use , this method was less effective when multiple people were crossing paths on the display . Based on these interruptions and conflicts , most groups quickly decided to leave the overall layout in rough form and rather refine it toward the end ( alignment of clusters phase ) . After a rough layout was created , participants started sorting and aligning the contents of the created clusters . The clusters mostly contained between three to fifteen artifacts , but in some cases isolate artifacts remained ( e . g . a to - do list covering the whole process or multiple process steps ) . The clusters were consistently built based on semantic relationships and commonalities . For example , a bubble may contain sketches from an early brainstorming activity . These were then sorted and aligned within the bubble shape based on attributes such as date of creation , type or relation ( e . g . alternative solution ) . However , not consistent pattern was identified across all clusters . All groups engaged in this activity to some extent , while one group spent significant effort on the alignment of artifacts within the clusters . When asked why , the group stated that the clusters " need to make sense " in themselves . The group also stated that the playful nature of the clusters invited such expressions . As thus , the clusters were used as an additional form of expression . This indicates that the bubble shape together with additional informal means of expression such as position , rotation and scaling , contributes to the reflection activity in a way that extends traditional forms of visualization such as lists , piles , stacks or folders . As a last step toward the result of a design process map , the groups spent time on the overall layout of the clusters on the canvas . Clusters were mostly aligned in a timeline - like sequence from left to right ( see Figure 6 . 17 ) . Frequently , the clusters had to be slightly modified to fit into this structure . However , one group distributed their clusters across the entire canvas toward the edges and corners as " key points " referring to key themes within the design process such as analysis results and designs . Yet , the progression and timely dependencies of these structures were coded using a circular layout and clockwise direction . When asked why they did so , the group stated that they wanted to harness all available screen space on the display rather than having to compromise the individual cluster layouts in order to achieve a timeline structure . They added that if the canvas would offer more horizontal space , they would however also prefer a timeline structure . Evaluation 198 Figure 6 . 17 : A process map produced by one of the groups . Note the overall timeline structure from left to right and the informal visualization of parallel or overlapping activities . Within clusters , different artifact sizes and overlapping collections such as stacks were used to express attributes such as importance or value . An additional analysis of the resulting maps provided insights on how the groups approached the mapping of process attributes to the artifact layout and clustering . The most prominent attribute was clearly identified as the time the artifacts were created and used . Most artifacts did relate to some activity or method within the design process , such as data from interviews conducted during the analysis phase , ideas from sketching sessions during the design phase or versions of a functional prototype . Accordingly , the participants used this sequence of events or milestones as a leading time - based structure in their overall cluster layouts . Some groups also coded overlapping or parallel activities by using the flexibility in shape offered by the bubble visualization ( see Figure 6 . 17 ) . This however was not true for the contents of the clusters , as no consistent pattern was found . The structure was also not found to be based on time in any of the groups . Rather , it was heavily influenced by the types of artifacts contained and the relations between them . For example , a cluster containing prototype screenshots was arranged using a layout based on lists , whereby each list was representing prototype iterations . However , other clusters within the same map had a layout based on the relative importance of the artifacts . Therefore , artifacts were emphasized by making them larger or smaller in size . Similarly , overlap was used to form piles of artifacts ( see Figure 6 . 17 ) . When asked why , the particular group stated that all artifacts in the pile were so similar that only one visible representation was necessary . Overall , all kinds of structures such as lists , timelines , stacks , piles as well as grids were evident within the resulting process maps . Some groups also tried to visualize hierarchies within the clusters . However , this was only possible in limited ways as there was no ability to create clusters within clusters . Based on the participant’s comments , this was also one of the most requested future improvements . Overall , the findings however indicate that ArtifactBubbles could indeed provide flexible layout options for different situations on multiple levels . Table 6 . 2 provides an overview of cluster and artifact attributes and their mappings identified within the study . ArtifactBubbles 199 Table 6 . 2 : Visual attributes of ArtifactBubbles and their application in the reflection activities . Visualization Reflection activity Cluster position Used for Timeline of process steps and activities or methods Planning and pre - sorting ( 2 ) Cluster size Used for de - emphasizing less important activities ( achieved through overlapping artifacts ) Planning and pre - sorting ( 2 ) Cluster distances Used for depicting parallelism and closely related design activities . Cluster alignment ( 4 ) Cluster shape Used for harnessing space and for visualizing relationships between design activities . Cluster alignment ( 4 ) Artifact position Used for flexible layouts such as lists and piles for depicting different relations between artifacts . Sorting within clusters ( 3 ) Artifact size Used for emphasizing important or hiding less important artifacts . Sorting within clusters ( 3 ) Artifact distances Used for depicting semantic distance . Sorting within clusters ( 3 ) Artifact rotation No specific use identified other than alignment for improving readability . Sorting within clusters ( 3 ) Artifact overlap Used for depicting identical or close related artifacts . Sorting within clusters ( 3 ) Eventually , the social behavior of participants was analyzed as to identify the influence of the system on group collaboration and communication . Therefore , the previously recognized reflection activities were examined in detail . Within the browsing phase , participants were mostly navigating and discussing . Thereby , deictic gestures were prevalent for guiding and influencing navigation on the canvas . As navigation in ArtifactBubbles is only feasible through single - person interaction , coordination and turn - taking was required . However , this did not always work smoothly , as accidental touching sometimes led to unexpected consequences . For example , when two persons were trying to pan the view at the same time , or when a deictic gesture was too close to the display surface , a zooming gesture was recognized by the system . This could be avoided in a future redesign by allowing users to temporarily zoom individual artifacts for getting a closer look . This would eventually also smooth out the partly rapid switches between detail and overview that occurred during the browsing phase . Although not a major issue , this interaction technique temporarily removes context – thus making it harder to relate artifacts to their more distant spatial surroundings . During the planning , pre - sorting and artifact sorting phases , collaborative actions were much more frequent , which also led to conflicts . Although the system generally supports the manipulation of multiple artifacts at the same time , it was clear that this ability still requires coordination and group awareness as in real - world collaborative practices . Similar to earlier studies in the context of affinity diagramming ( see section 4 . 2 . 1 ) , mutual blocking occurred at the vertical wall display . This is due to the interaction paths crossing each other on the canvas . A future setup may hence investigate a horizontal or angular layout of the display to avoid this phenomenon . However , this would also compromise the visibility of artifacts . Distribution of work within the group to avoid conflicts was practiced most frequently within the third and fourth phase of detailed layout and alignment . The large size of the interactive display made it possible to accommodate at least two people working Evaluation 200 side - by - side . This however was most efficiently done when aligning two spatially distant clusters or by working on the alignment of artifacts within separate clusters . Within the final focus group , participants were questioned about general impressions on the usability and adequateness of the tool for the task . They were also asked if and how they could make use of the tool in future design processes . Most of the participants found the tool to be useful for visualizing and presenting design processes but suggested improvements to the usability of some components . For example , the use of direct touch did not always lead to the expected results ( e . g . collaborative use ) . Further , the performance and feedback delivered by the system was limited when multiple artifacts or clusters were moved at the same time . This sometimes led to participants being confused about the effects of their actions . Comparing their experiences with Evernote , the groups consistently agreed that ArtifactBubbles provides much more value than the formal list - and tag - based visualization of notes in Evernote . The spatial way of organizing design artifacts in a clustered map did evidently better fit their conceptual models of the design process . Participants however suggested multiple improvements to the system design . For example , color could be used as an additional visual property for coding attributes such as type , importance , value or hierarchy ( e . g . as in affinity diagramming , where colored notes represent hierarchies ) . This way , intermediate results or milestones could be emphasized by using both size and the color of artifacts . Further , the students suggested the addition of labels as artifacts or the ability to write and scribble on the canvas to further add comments . Although not necessary for internal reflection , it would augment the system for presentation purposes . Two groups stated that they could imagine using the tool during and not after the process in order to visualize the current state of the process and for collaboratively reflecting upon past results for planning the next process activities . This would indeed be feasible by more tightly integrating ArtifactBubbles with the Evernote system . Currently , ArtifactBubbles serves as a read - only view on an artifact repository and its contents are not synchronized with changes in Evernote . Overall , participants described the interface as motivating and generally enjoyed the use of the tool despite some limitations in performance . Reflecting upon the results of the contextual user study , one may argue that ArtifactBubbles successfully provided an interactive spatial view onto design artifact collections . It is different to existing digital visualizations for design reflection in regard to its direct and informal nature . Further , it is a system that works well even in collaborative usage . Thus it may be used to extend existing design documentation tools such as those discussed in the analysis ( see section 6 . 2 ) . Yet , it is to mention here that the manual layout also brings about limitations in the ability to generate automatic or dynamic visualizations . Further , its functionality was tested within a specific situation that involved the reflection of a completed design process involving many steps and activities . However , its concept may also be applied to short - term reflection such as within design methods like affinity diagramming . The Bubble technique as a grouping concept proved to be especially suited for an application to design documentation as it offers a rich set of visual properties to match the attributes of many different design artifacts and their relations . It was also shown to support incremental refinement as it stimulates the creation of intermediate cluster representations . Overall , the following implications for design can be extracted from the study findings : Spatial grouping closely reflects traditional practices of knowledge visualization and is perceived as a suitable concept for visualizing design artifact collections . It provides more flexibility and expressivity than traditional formal visualization approaches . However , it brings about limitations in the ability to create dynamic views or automatic layouts . ArtifactBubbles 201 Reflection activities can be supported by spatial grouping techniques under the premise that the grouping technique supports and stimulates incremental refinement . It was shown that this worked well using a grouping technique based on the concept of proximity . Augmenting documentation activities with large - scale visualizations has not only potential for long - term reflection but may also be applied to situations of in - situ or short - term usage . 6 . 5 Summary & Contributions In the following , the contributions of this case study are summarized . In a first step , the research is contrasted with similar tools or interaction techniques . Thereby , the individual differences of the presented approach to existing solutions are emphasized . Thereafter , the technical and empirical contributions of this case study in general , and specifically to the application domain are summarized . 6 . 5 . 1 Related Work The research presented in this case study relates to two different domains . One the one hand , the presented and studied interaction techniques Bin and Bubble refer to existing interaction concepts for supporting spatial grouping . On the other hand , the ArtifactBubbles approach discussed in the second user study relates to the domain of digital tool support for collaborative reflection activities . While the presented grouping techniques are an extension of existing techniques for use on interactive surfaces with multi - touch interaction , the ArtifactBubbles tool is a novel application that complements existing documentation tools . Regarding the presented grouping techniques this caste study relates to spatial grouping techniques in general such as those used in desktop - based interfaces ( see section 6 . 1 ) . The discussed approaches are for example similar to Data Mountain ( G . Robertson et al . , 1998 ) in the sense that they also employ thumbnail views to convey the contents of information items to the user . However , no three - dimensional layout is used for visualization . Rather , a spatial layout using zoomable user interface techniques is employed . This is similar to the concepts used in Dynapad ( Bauer et al . , 2005 ) and Pad + + ( Bederson & Hollan , 1995 ) , which also use zooming techniques for supporting spatial navigation on a two - dimensional canvas . Dynapad also uses containers as grouping technique . However , both systems are focused on a desktop environment and single pointer interaction . The grouping concept Clumps within Dynapad is similar to the Bin approach because it supports spatial layouts within grouped clusters . The most relevant previous research however are the interaction techniques Bubble Clusters ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) and Storage Bins ( Scott et al . , 2005 ) , as these were the foundation and inspiration to the investigations within this chapter . This research extends both techniques for the effective use on interactive surfaces . While the Storage Bins technique was only slightly adapted , the Bubble Clusters technique was ported from a desktop and mouse concept to grouping concept supporting simultaneous interaction on interactive surfaces . The discussed interaction concepts hence also contribute to the general design space of interactive surfaces by forming alternatives to the existing grouping techniques found within most software development kits such as Surface SDK . As a reflection tool , ArtifactBubbles relates to existing approaches and tools that focus on supporting individual or collaborative reflection on design activities . Specifically , it relates to the systems Cabinet ( Keller et al . , 2006 ) , Pictionaire ( Hartmann et al . , 2010 ) , IdeaSpaces ( Venkataswamy et al . , 2009 ) , CAM ( Vyas , Heylen , Nijholt , & Veer , 2008 ) , the Ideas Design Ecology ( Lee , 2006 ) , Freed ( Mendels et al . , 2011 ) , PRT ( Dalsgaard & Halskov , 2012 ) and Dazzle ( Oehlberg et al . , 2012 ) . The limitations of these systems were already discussed previously ( see section 6 . 1 ) . The presented concept of Summary & Contributions 202 ArtifactBubbles addresses a common limitation of all tools , namely support for informal visualization in a collaborative setting . It provides a true multi - user interface with a spatial grouping technique that supports incremental formalization . In contrast to most other tools however , ArtifactBubbles focuses on the visualization aspect rather than supporting capturing mechanisms . It relies on the dedicated capturing and documentation functionality of Evernote instead . 6 . 5 . 2 Conceptual and Technical Contributions This case study contributes alternative concepts for spatial visualization and hands - on collaborative interaction in the context of design process documentation and reflection . It proposes spatial grouping as a technical solution to the issues of formality , fluency and flexibility that were identified during an exploratory study ( see section 6 . 2 . 2 ) . Hence , the concepts presented in this chapter may be used to extend or improve state - of - the - art tools in the context of design process documentation and introduces the use of large - scale visualizations for collaborative reflection support . The presented interaction techniques may either be integrated into existing activity - centric solutions such as tools supporting a specific design method or techniques . They however may also be used as isolate methodic approach as demonstrated in the contextual user study within this chapter . The ArtifactBubbles concept was shown to have an informal nature that stimulates incremental refinement . Its techniques that are especially designed to harness the benefits of multi - touch and bimanual interaction stimulate strategies that are more fluent than existing approaches . The flexibility and expressivity of the employed spatial visualizations allows the implicit and explicit mapping of design artifact attributes onto visual properties such as size , position , distance and rotation . The concepts presented in this case study are based on an analysis of digital documentation activities and their drawbacks . Therefore , explicit requirements on spatial grouping techniques for supporting such scenarios were derived . These may also be used by other researchers for designing similar or alternative approaches . Table 6 . 3 summarizes how ArtifactBubbles addresses themes of digital creativity support ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) as well as established guidelines and requirements for such systems ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 , Table 3 . 2 ) . Table 6 . 3 : How ArtifactBubbles addresses guidelines and requirements for creativity support . Externalization Reflection Collaboration Process fluent interaction with incremental formalization Storage and retrieval through database persistence transitions between collaboration modes through turn - taking Preserves important aspects of the traditional method Hands - on interaction with the clustering technique , support for gesturing , navigating and moving Spatial visualization as imprecise representations is used for depicting design processes Bubble affordances invite group interaction , System design cares for embodied actions Augments typical activities through additional functionality such as grouping Independent from the application domain of creativity support and design tools , the discussed interaction techniques Bin and Bubble may also be reused for different purposes . The task of grouping digital items and the activity of clustering are common in various domains . From sorting photos to managing files , many activities require users to move single or multiple items around for creating spatial aggregations or groups . The manual way of moving and dragging objects thereby serves as an implicit tool for filtering and synthesizing , thereby taking advantage of the human capabilities of recall , visual search and reasoning . Both techniques actively advance the state of the art in this domain by harnessing the benefits of interactive surfaces . It was shown that multi - touch interaction bears great potential for supporting the manipulation of individual items and groups more ArtifactBubbles 203 efficiently than it is possible with traditional single pointer desktop interfaces . The design concepts thus can be reused by researchers working in a variety of domains . The Bubble technique was shown to be especially suitable for situations where incremental formalization is required . This is especially noteworthy since existing concepts based on the container metaphor usually require planning before grouping actions can be applied . The proximity metaphor of the Bubble technique hence extends the design space toward the support for more informal and iterative grouping strategies as required in creative work processes . 6 . 5 . 3 Empirical Contributions The ArtifactBubbles case study contributes empirical findings on multiple levels . Three user studies were conducted : an exploratory study , a comparative experiment , and a user study in the context of collaborative reflection . The first study shed light on the limitations of note - taking software for the use as design documentation and reflection tool . It provided insights on existing functionality and its usefulness for documenting the events , artifacts and results of methodic design processes . It revealed limitations in the areas of fluency , overview and navigation , which both relate to visualization . Other researchers working on similar issues may use the provided data for creating their own solution to these problems . However , they may only be valid within the studied context of design processes . As a result from the exploratory study , a focus on investigating spatial visualizations was derived . Within a comparative experiment , two variants for grouping items spatially were explored for use on interactive , multi - touch surfaces . The experiment compared the traditional container metaphor with a more recent approach that is based on proximity rather than containment . An experiment involving an abstract grouping and re - grouping task provided insights on the effects of both concepts on measures of performance and user satisfaction as well as the use of multiple fingers and bi - manual interaction . The results indicated that the proximity concept is more beneficial than the containment concept for grouping items . However , no significant differences were found for re - grouping . Most important however , different strategies were observed regarding planning behavior . The proximity concept was found to be stimulating an incremental grouping strategy . This is especially useful for supporting situations where structure is not readily available but rather emerges during the grouping activity . As the experiment involved a rather abstract task and isolated contextual influences , the findings can be readily transferred to many other application domains . Eventually , this case study also reported a user study providing insights on the usefulness of spatial grouping as a visualization concept in the context of collaborative reflection . Using a long - term reflection task rooted within a real design process , insights on the beneficial characteristics of spatial visualization were revealed . This regards the flexibility , fluency and informality that is evident in previous approaches . The study also demonstrated how attributes of design artifacts can be mapped to visual properties . Researchers working in the field of design practice and visualization may reuse these findings for designing new approaches such as dynamic or automatically generated visualizations .

Thereby , knowledge gained from the conducted research approach and the case studies is synthesized for the reuse and extension by other researchers . First , all chapters of the thesis are briefly summarized before contributions and limitations within the aspects of methodology , design and user studies are reflected . Eventually , the main findings of this thesis are abstracted and presented as guidelines before proposals for future work are described . 7 . 1 Thesis Summary The goal of the research described within this thesis was to address the problems of digital tool support for collaborative and material design activities . A fundamental question raised in the introducing chapter of this work was if and how digital tools can be designed in such a way as to be unobtrusive to traditional workflows and methods while at the same time supporting or augmenting design practices . This research topic was motivated by describing the lack of current support and potential benefits of embodied interaction . It was further argued that this lack of support could impact the use of technology and also the quality of the design process . This motivation prompted the following research question ( RQ ) : How can we design digital design tools that preserve and augment material and social practices of collaborative design activities ? To answer this 7 Thesis Summary 206 research question , three research objectives were derived that guided the research approach and methodology . Within the first research objective ( RO1 ) , the need for a design methodology was devised that systematically addresses the proposed research goal of integrating digital functionality with material design practices . It was further proposed within RO2 , that new digital tools and interaction techniques should be designed and developed in order to investigate technological means of preserving and augmenting specific collaborative design activities . Eventually , RO3 was devised as to evaluate the developed tools to assess the success of the conducted research in relation to the research question . Based on the research question and the derived research objectives , a structured research approach was carried out that consisted of an initial analytical step of literature reviews regarding design theory and embodied design practices as well as supportive technologies . Within Chapter 2 of this thesis , a deeper understanding of the existing theoretical and practical research was provided . By reviewing definitions of design , creativity and design collaboration from literature , it also cared for further discussions of material and collaborative practices in design and the role of design methods in particular . Theoretical foundations for understanding and supporting creative collaboration as well as field data from observations of real - world design practices was discussed and summarized . Within Chapter 3 existing approaches for supporting collaborative design with technology such as design guidelines , frameworks and tools to support creativity and design were critically reviewed . Furthermore , previous research in supporting collaborative design activities with technology were critically explored , compared and reviewed , revealing limitations and a need for further investigations . Eventually , the research field of tangible interfaces and embodied interaction was reviewed and analyzed by comparing and commenting on existing theoretical framework . As a result of this analysis , a custom design methodology was devised as a mean to address RO1 . This design methodology was then used as a foundation to the empirical part of this research which resulted in specific case studies . Using typical examples of traditional collaborative and material design activities , three specific tool designs were derived from field observations and implemented as functional prototypes ( RO2 ) . In Chapter 4 , a case study investigating support for the design technique “Affinity Diagramming” was presented . The case study resulted in the design and evaluation of a hybrid interactive space called “AffinityTable” . Similarly , a case study on supporting the design technique “Brainsketching” was presented in Chapter 5 . A workflow - focused interactive space called “IdeaVis” was designed and evaluated as a result of the case study . In Chapter 6 , an investigation into supporting the specific task of informal design documentation and spatial design artifact organization was reported . The case study resulted in two different interface variants that were tested and compared within an empirical experiment . Further , the prototype tool “ArtifactBubbles” for visualizing artifact collections within reflective activities was introduced as an alternative to more formal approaches . Within all case studies presented in this thesis , an observation was conducted to inform the design rationale which was devised as explicit tradeoff decisions . These tradeoff decisions were the foundation for subsequently conducted design , prototyping and evaluation efforts . Overall , the developed prototypes contributed to the second research objective in the form of holistic system designs supporting specific workflows and methods and a wide range of interaction techniques within the themes of “Externalization” , “Reflection” and “Collaboration” . Within exploratory user studies described in Chapters 4 , 5 and 6 , these prototype tools were also evaluated as to investigate the effect and potential of the systems and their interaction techniques ( RO3 ) . Along the tradeoff decisions in each studied case , findings related to the usefulness and impact of the respective design decisions on Conclusion 207 the original characteristics of the method and workflow were described . These findings are ultimately summarized and synthesized in the proceedings of this chapter . 7 . 2 Reflections In the following , the contributions and limitations of the conducted research are reflected based on the three research objectives . First , reflections on the development and usefulness of the derived design methodology ( RO1 ) are provided . Secondly , the results of the designed systems and interaction techniques are critically reflected ( RO2 ) . Eventually , the potential value and the validity of the findings derived from the conducted user studies are discussed ( RO3 ) . 7 . 2 . 1 On Methodology As a result of the research efforts in devising a design methodology that explicitly addresses the need to bridge physical and digital design practices ( RO1 ) , a tradeoff - driven design process based on the Reality - based Interaction Framework ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) was defined and carried out within the three case studies . This design methodology was also used for conceptualizing findings from observations , for informing and grounding the design process and for evaluating prototype implementations . Contributions The design methodology proposed and exemplified within this thesis is a contribution to HCI research as it demonstrates a tool for design that can be adapted for reuse by other researchers . The use of tradeoffs in Interaction Design processes is a tool that was previously proposed by HCI researchers and that was also shown to be beneficial in practice ( Rosson & Carroll , 2001 ) . For example , Rosson and Caroll introduced the concept of claims as a key strategy in Scenario - Based Design ( SBD ) ( Rosson & Carroll , 2001 ) . Thereby , claims are brief statements used to analyze narrative scenarios for identifying the positive and negative impacts on the user . Used as forms of design hypotheses , these claims are tools for designers to indicate conditions under which specific interaction techniques or system designs have a positive or negative impact to the user . An important characteristic of the claims technique thereby is that it has been shown to be beneficial for supporting the reuse of design knowledge . It offers an effective way to preserve and archive not only current design knowledge but also previously elicited findings ( Sutcliffe , 2000 ) . Further , claims also provide a way of capturing design rationale and serve as an effective tool of design argumentation ( Shum , 1996 ) . Overall , the use of claims may motivate designers to reason over their design decisions and to strive for maximizing the positive effects of the proposed interface over the negative effects it might introduce . The way tradeoffs are used in this research therefore is similar to the way claims can be used in a design process . The tradeoffs described within this thesis may be reused and adapted for different design situations . In contrast to claims however , the tradeoffs used in the case studies are framed within the RBI framework ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) . As a result , they reference desired qualities of material or digital tools rather than abstract effects on the user . Thereby , they describe not only positive and negative consequences , but a more ambiguous and more complex tension . The tradeoffs are further placed within a power vs . reality continuum to classify their character between preserving , supporting or augmenting traditional practices . This way , designers are also able to reflect on the relations and tensions between multiple potential tradeoff decisions . Initially , the power vs . reality tradeoff concept was proposed by Jacob et al . for conceptualizing and understanding a new generation of interaction styles that are increasingly emerging in the ubiquitous computing era ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) . In this thesis however , the RBI framework is used as a tool for design and as a mean to ground and evaluate designs . By embedding tradeoff decisions into an iterative design process , they are used not only for conceptualizing design goals , but also for analysis , argumentation and Reflections 208 evaluation . Thereby , the discussed design methodology may be considered an extension to the framework with the goal to improve existing practices . The design methodology presented in this thesis can be adapted by other researchers , not only for the design of similar systems within the domain of collaborative design tools , but also for other research that shares the goal of preserving , supporting or augmenting existing material , physical or social practices with a subtle and calm application of technology . The descriptions in this thesis also contribute to a better understanding of the use of tradeoffs in the design process and advocate the value of explicit design decisions and argumentation . Limitations The design methodology followed within this research was devised with the clear goal of supporting collaborative design activities in general and for designing for material practices in particular . Therefore , it has limitations and might not be suitable as a more general design tool , design strategy or design theory . One particular strong limitation of the design methodology put forward in this thesis is that it is only considered useful for designing a calm and subtle application of technology in fields that rely on a strong use of traditional or material practices . As such , it is not suitable for design domains that do not have a “real” or “traditional” counterpart , for example entirely digital work practices or workflows . As its main goal is to augment traditional practices , such concepts need to be existent for being able to apply tradeoff decisions . Further , the nature of tradeoff decisions between traditional practices and benefits of digital technology inevitably steers toward incremental innovations rather than revolutionary changes of work practices . If the goal of a design project is not to preserve specific aspects of work practices , other methodologies may be more suitable as they might be able bring more innovation into the design process . Another aspect that limits the validity and applicability of the proposed design methodology is that it heavily depends on the concept of “reality” as defined by Jacob et al . ( 2008 ) . Reality is a rather abstract concept that needs to be mapped to application domains before it can be applied . In the case of this research , the concept of reality was mapped to material and social design practices that are considered effective in their traditional nature . Researchers or designers that seek to adapt the design methodology to other domains also need to pay special attention to the fact that reality is an arguably abstract concept that may differ between user populations , user backgrounds and cultures . Hence , as there is no clear definition of what properties of the world constitute “reality” for a given domain , the designer has to build upon interpretations to some extent . This in turn limits the transferability and reproduction of the design decisions and solutions by other designers or researchers . In this research , field data and own observations of traditional design practices were utilized for defining crucial aspects of reality that need to be respected in the design process . It is argued that such measures are inevitable for being able to benefit from the proposed design methodology . Considering the previously discussed limitations , the design methodology presented in this thesis can thus be considered a complement to existing design strategies and may be applied if the described conditions are met . 7 . 2 . 2 On Design The arguably most significant contributions of this thesis are interaction techniques and prototype system designs for supporting creative group work in general and collaborative design activities in particular . These concepts , resulting from the design - oriented investigations conducted as part of the second research objective were established and demonstrated within several case study descriptions ( Chapters 4 , 5 , 6 ) . The detailed descriptions from the successful use of a particular technology or a combination of several technologies as well as their effects contribute to both general HCI design knowledge and to domain specific design knowledge . Designers are able to replicate or extend the presented techniques for supporting other design situations . Conclusion 209 Contributions The interaction techniques presented and discussed in this thesis contribute to the general design space of embodied interaction , collaborative software ( CSCW ) , tangible user interfaces , multi - display environments , interactive spaces , multi - touch interaction and spatial computing . However , the described interaction techniques were not designed in isolation , but to complement existing workflows within the domain of design practice . Consequently , the particular combination of interaction techniques demonstrated in each case study contributes to the design space of creativity support tools and collaborative design tools . Throughout this thesis , the design space was framed into the themes of “Externalization” , “Reflection” , “Collaboration” and “Process” . Each interaction technique discussed in this work contributes to at least one of these themes as a technical innovation , an extension , or an alternative to existing designs . Within each case study , the interaction techniques were summarized and contrasted with related work according to these themes . Table 7 . 1 summarizes how the main interaction concepts and system designs from the case studies contribute to each theme of the design space . Table 7 . 1 : Technical and conceptual contributions of this thesis and their relation to the themes of design practice .

For example , within the first and the second case study it was shown how digital pen & paper technology can be used to support idea externalization for individual , collaborative and divergent activities as well as convergent activities . Hybrid paper notes were used within the AffinityTable system as an effective concept to support rapid idea production that avoids common issues such as production blocking . It was further shown how these hybrid artifacts can be used to support sharing and retrieval in collaborative settings . Similarly , an alternative concept was used in the second case study IdeaVis . Using hybrid paper sketches and a digital pen & paper interface similar functionality was achieved – however with a focus on convergent activities . Both interaction techniques thus have their unique benefits and Reflections 210 drawbacks depending on the desired workflow integration . In contrast to the externalization concepts used in these case studies , the third case study presented an interaction technique for externalizing design knowledge within a spatial visualization that includes several artifacts . Using ArtifactBubbles , spatial ways of externalization are utilized for artifact organization , thereby addressing a complementary and informal way of externalizing the relations between different design artifacts . In isolation as well as in combination , all above mentioned interaction techniques can be considered by other researchers or designers for supporting creative externalization in various contexts . Within the theme of “Reflection” , this research has demonstrated how digital and physical workspaces can be combined to support and augment the spatial nature of design practice . In the first case study , the interactive space enhanced awareness and reflection with dynamic overview & detail views . Different ways of clustering and collecting digital notes through spatial arrangement contribute to the design space for collaborative sense - making activities . Tangible tools for presenting and discussing artifacts in detail as well as navigating workspaces and artifacts contribute to more general multi - display interaction techniques . Similarly , the second case study focused on the use of a reflection display and detail views using hybrid pen & paper interaction techniques . These techniques thereby again represent alternatives for the use of tangible tools in the first case study . While both cases also exemplify interaction techniques for clustering and navigating digital design artifacts , the third case study explored this theme in detail , proposing entirely novel ways of organizing and interacting with collections of digital design artifacts . Using more sophisticated interaction techniques for this particular task , the third case study complements the others , describing concepts that can be used as alternative or extension to more traditional methods of artifact organization . Overall these spatial interaction techniques contribute to the goal of supporting awareness , accessibility and reflection over design artifacts in group situations . As such they can also be adapted and redesigned for use in more general sense - making , presentation or discussion activities . The design work in this thesis also contributes to the theme of “Collaboration” as it introduced a variety of interaction techniques and collaboration concepts that support social practices . Collaborative workspaces and tangible tools were designed , respecting requirements for privacy , turn - taking and simultaneous interactions within group situations . In the first case study , the use of individual and shared territories as well as tangible artifacts was exemplified as means to support group constellations and requirements regarding group awareness but also social factors like evaluation apprehension , free riding or production blocking . Similarly , in the second case study , different digital and physical territories were combined to emphasize the material aspects of collaboration and how they can be combined with digital tools in a subtle , yet effective way . Further , support for the particular role of the creative facilitator was pioneered , introducing a new way of supporting creative group work through a dedicated supporting role . While in the case presented in this thesis this concept was shown to be effective mainly for convergence , it may be applied differently for supporting other design activities and might also be designed for amplifying divergence . In contrast to the workflow - oriented concepts of the first two case studies , the third case study focused on informal spatial representations that facilitate common understanding and awareness in design teams through the activity of reflection . Thereby , the visualization of design artifacts and their relations complements the design space by contributing a shared reflective representation for supporting both synchronous as well as asynchronous situations . As with the previous discussed interaction techniques , the demonstrated concepts for supporting design collaboration may be adapted and combined for supporting creative collaborative work in general and sense - making tasks or group discussions in particular . Eventually , this research was not limited to the design of isolated interaction techniques but also presented interactive spaces aimed at supporting real work situations by supporting or extending the Conclusion 211 creative “Process” . As one of the main goals of this research was to understand and preserve traditional workflows of collaborative design activities , the case studies also demonstrated how workflows can be extended or augmented using subtle and careful combinations of digital features and interaction techniques . In the first case study , the method of Affinity Diagramming was extended in regard to both divergent and convergent aspects . By integrating interactive overview & detail visualizations , image retrieval and search functionality , the developed system design aims toward better supporting awareness and reflection during convergent phases of the design activity . At the same time however , it preserves the original characteristics of divergent activities with the use of digital pen & paper , individual workspaces and a shared interaction space . Likewise , the IdeaVis system preserves and extends the traditional workflow of sketching sessions through an entirely optional integration of digital functionality . While particular interaction techniques using digital pen & paper interfaces and the ability to duplicate ideas aim at augmenting the original workflow toward divergence , the provided interactive views on high resolution displays and the design activity visualization are used to augment the convergent aspects of the method . IdeaVis also makes use of the role of creative facilitators as a further mean to augment the original workflow in an indirect way . The third case introduced the concept of ArtifactBubbles and a new visual representation for reflecting on design processes . Thereby , it extends traditional methods such as Design Process Maps , but also introduces a way of expression that is not possible by using traditional material only . Overall , the concept may be used best to support convergent and reflective aspects of design activities . Other researchers may reproduce , advance or adapt concepts from all discussed cases for supporting divergent and convergent characteristics of design activities . Thereby , various other combinations of the techniques presented in this thesis may be envisioned for augmenting or extending further traditional methods as well ( see section 2 . 2 . 6 ) . As a further aspect , all tools enable automatic documentation of design activities for further reuse . Because the design activities are recorded and digitally archived just by using the design tools , rich documentation is captured that might be used to analyze or reuse the embodied design knowledge – something that can only be achieved with great efforts when using traditional tools . While this aspect was not a focus of the empirical research at hand , investigations into the usefulness and practicability of such design activity documentations encompassing the whole design processes and multiple design projects or teams seem to be a promising direction for future investigations . Limitations The interaction techniques and system designs presented and discussed within this thesis have limitations that should be considered by other researchers or practitioners before reusing or adapting them to similar design problems . Hence , in the following the main limitations regarding novelty , practicability and applicability of the conceptual and technical contributions are discussed . Regarding the novelty of the tool designs and interaction techniques one may consider that the degree of novelty highly depends on the context of use . As the overall tool designs are uniquely designed combinations and integrations of interaction techniques attuned to a particular task or activity , the interaction techniques themselves cannot be considered entirely novel when compared to existing techniques in isolation . For example , the use of certain technologies like tangible user interface components for supporting important aspects of group work were demonstrated to be useful and applicable by previous research ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) . This is also true for other concepts reused and adapted for the cases presented in this thesis such as digital pen & paper , multi - touch interaction and multiple displays or visualizations . The novelty hence emerges from application of technical solutions to the problems of the particular design space of supporting collaborative design practice . In this context and with respect to the findings that are delivered with the techniques as part of the user studies , they may be considered for use and extension . Therefore , each case study Reflections 212 description also includes references to existing abstract interaction techniques and the respective differences where applicable . For the case studies , prototypical implementations were developed in order to experience and evaluate the design concepts . This was not only done as a research vehicle , but also for discussing concepts with other researchers and for empirical investigations within user studies . Therefore , system designs were prototyped up to a level of maturity that cared for live demonstrations and short - term controlled lab studies . Since it was beyond the scope of the thesis to reach a maturity that would allow deployment of the systems , all developed prototypes have technical limitations regarding stability and flexibility that would be required for long - term use in industrial settings . Practicability of the developed tools is also limited regarding the cost of certain technologies in relation to the benefits they might yield . Most concepts rely on cutting edge technology that is rarely available commercially and thus required significant financial investments . However , this might change in the future as the general infrastructure and many of the used technologies such as multi - touch displays , high - resolution screens and digital pen & paper are currently evolving , which is expected to increase general availability and to lower costs . Nevertheless , as many concepts are subtle or optional to the work itself , it is yet to be examined if a reasonable cost - benefit ratio can be achieved in the long term . Regarding the degree of applicability , the presented system designs and interaction techniques may be applied to various different contexts and scenarios that relate to group work in general . However , this research solely provides empirical data on the effect of the techniques and systems within the context of collaborative creative group activities . Hence , the effects may be differently when applied to other work domains . Likewise , the tool designs were informed by very specific workflows and methods such as Affinity Diagramming or Brainsketching . This was due to the need for a well - defined procedure as one of the goals of this research was to preserve traditional workflows . When used in a more flexible and open manner , the tool designs an interaction techniques may be combined in ways that enable entirely new workflows and design techniques . However , based on the experiences made during this research , it is to mention that this might have unforeseeable effects that can also lead to undesired outcomes ( e . g . possible misuse of the image search functionality within AffinityTable ) . As mentioned earlier , some of the developed concepts and interaction techniques may also be conceptualized as tools for documenting design activities . However , as this was not the intended use but rather a by - product of this research , it is beyond the scope of this thesis to judge their adequateness for this purpose . As a result , one may consider improvements and further functionality of the tools in regard to these aspects . Practitioners for example would have a strong need for interoperability ( e . g . PDF export ) . Further they also raised issues in terms of security and ethics of the logged data if these tools should be employed for a long - term documentation purpose in industrial practice . 7 . 2 . 3 On User Studies This thesis contributes empirical findings derived from multiple observational studies and experiments conducted during the case studies . One the one hand , own field data was collected and analyzed to inform the designs . On the other hand , developed prototypes were assessed in qualitative studies as to judge the benefits and drawbacks of each design decision as well as the potential impact of the system designs on the design method or workflow . In the following the contributions and limitation of these empirical studies are reflected upon . Contributions The findings described in this thesis relate to the characteristics of material and social practices in design and the effect of interaction techniques on these characteristics . For two specific design Conclusion 213 activities , namely Affinity Diagramming and Brainsketching , traditional practices and their relation to workflows and methods were studied with observations . These analytical descriptions deliver insights into the specific physical and social interactions that are considered crucial for the success of traditional design practices . Framed within the RBI framework , the methodology and practice of these observations may be applied to other design activities as well . The specific findings of the observational studies however , may be used by other researchers for supporting these particular design techniques . As the findings were also abstracted into tradeoff decisions , these may be used to inform other tool designs as well . As these design goals are quite abstract , researchers may come up with entirely different solutions to the same design problem . Hence , the framing of design problems extracted from field observations can be considered as a contribution to creativity support and design tool research . Nevertheless , they might also be of value to researchers interested in the general characteristics and practices of material group work . As part of the user studies conducted within the first two case studies , the effects of prototypical implementations on the workflows of the studied design methods were described . This was provided by investigating the acceptance and usefulness of the defined tradeoff decisions on the particular characteristics they addressed . These findings on acceptance and applicability of interaction techniques to a particular task contribute to the design space of interactive systems in general and to the design of collaborative design tools in specific . Nevertheless , the findings also deliver insights on how to effectively bridge the gap between material and digital practices . This knowledge may also be useful as a design inspiration for other application domains as well . The user studies further contribute findings on the use and impact of interaction techniques and holistic system designs on the workflow of design methods . Although only valid in their specific context , these descriptions may inform other researchers in developing digital tools that also seek to emphasize divergent or convergent aspects of creative group work . As the cases chosen for the studies in this thesis are considered to be exemplary for a wide range of design methods they may be adapted , combined and reused for a variety of similar cases . In contrast to the first two case studies that focused on traditional workflows , the third case study included a comparative experimental study on the use of two different interaction variants for organizing artifacts spatially on interactive surfaces . Because this aspect considers well - defined measures of performance such as the task efficiency and use of multiple fingers , a combined quantitative and qualitative approach was chosen to prove the claimed effects with a comparison . These findings are hence much less abstract and may directly relate to similar design problems . Limitations The most significant limitations of the findings delivered by the user studies relate to transferability and validity . As the studies mainly focused on very specific procedures that are well defined , this limits their applicability to more loosely defined practices . Such openness to process and methods may yield different kinds of social and material interactions . Hence , the results may only be applicable to structured and disciplined design activities . The user studies were further limited regarding the use of mostly non - professional participants , small sample sizes , an artificial design environment ( lab ) and a restricted duration and task coverage of the user studies . While it was not feasible to study the design methods and the prototype implementations in real design practice such as professional design studios and designers working on real design tasks , steps were taken to compensate for these limitations . Due to a lack of access to representative professional design practitioners , teams of graduate students in the study fields of interaction design or creative direction were recruited as study subjects for observation of traditional Guidelines for Supporting Embodied Practices in Design 214 practices as well as to work with the prototype tools . All teams of graduate students were embedded in simulated design processes as part of an interaction design course or semester project and were reasonably experienced in the relevant methods and practices . The design tasks were simulated as well but the problems used were always open - ended and ill - defined like many typical design tasks . While the initial observations of traditional practices were embedded into long - term design projects , it was only feasible to study the prototype implementations in isolation within controlled lab studies and artificial design tasks . While the described limitations did not hamper the investigation of the primary research question , an ethnographic approach including authentic design tasks in genuine design projects with real designers in actual design environments would have provided a wealth of rich contextual data that would have allowed addressing many more research questions . However , considering the experiences of other researchers ( Shneiderman , 2005 ; Shneiderman , Fischer , et al . , 2006 ; Warr , 2007 ) it would have been rather problematical to run controlled studies in such settings . A further limitation of this research – with exception of the findings presented as part of a comparative study in the third case study – is the deficiency of findings regarding traditional measures such as task performance , efficiency and effectiveness . Although these measures were not a goal of the research at hand , one may reasonably ask if the described tools and interaction techniques can actually improve the creative process by making it either more efficient or more productive . Hence , empirical proof within a controlled comparative experiment may be necessary to answer this question . However , it was shown by previous research to be not ecologically valid to do so . For example , Nunamaker et al . argue that non - technical tools such as pen and paper should not be experimentally compared with digital support tools as the two practices are too dissimilar and the number of confounding variables and interaction effects are too immense ( Nunamaker , Dennis , Valacich , Vogel , & George , 1991 and Reinig , Briggs , & Nunamaker , 2007 ) . Hence , researchers in the domain of creativity support tools consistently recommend explorative evaluations of such tools to justify design claims ( Shneiderman , Fischer , et al . , 2006 ) . 7 . 3 Guidelines for Supporting Embodied Practices in Design By linking the design concepts explored within this thesis with the findings from the performed user studies across all case studies , accumulated knowledge from addressing the research objectives may be used to devise general implications for design . These abstract recommendations that are based on the experiences of this research may be considered by other researchers or practitioners when designing for embodied practices in design . As a literature review demonstrated ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 ) , guidelines and abstract design principles are well established within the design tools research community and among creativity support researchers . They are especially useful as a tool in early design activities to guide the general direction of the design process . Although a rather subjective instrument , they are consistently considered a useful tool for abstracting and disseminating research findings in this particular domain ( see section 3 . 1 . 3 ) . In the following , such guidelines are given for answering the initially posed research question . The findings and experiences from this research are thus concluded in the following “Guidelines for Supporting Embodied Practices in Design” . Each guideline is accompanied with links to the case studies within this thesis for further reference . G1 : Support embodied externalization with hybrid and fluent interaction modalities Embodied externalization is an integral characteristic of many design activities . Within ideation as well as in reflection , directness and immediacy of interaction with embodied modalities such as touch and physical artifacts is recommended over indirect or entirely digital interaction modalities . The use of hybrid design artifacts – artifacts that combine characteristics of digital technology but at the same time facilitate physical or material properties – are considered beneficial for supporting a wide range Conclusion 215 of creative activities in both individual and group situations . As the case studies within this thesis demonstrated , physical characteristics are helpful in making digital functionality accessible and controllable in many creative situations . These characteristics may also be used to augment exploration and playfulness of a digital design tool . The case studies within this thesis have demonstrated that support for embodied externalization is feasible within different scopes such as for rapid ideation ( Hybrid Paper Notes , see Chapter 4 ) , for more detailed externalization of imagery within sketching sessions ( Hybrid Paper Sketches , see Chapter 5 ) , or for the abstract externalization of design artifact collections ( Design Process Maps , see Chapter 6 ) . The extent of physicality shall however be carefully balanced with the need for digital functionality as demonstrated in the various tradeoffs of the design studies . G2 : Support reflection with spatial information management and informal navigation techniques Reflection activities are important elements of many individual and collaborative design practices . Short - term or long - term reflection activities require support for stepping back and comparing artifacts and related implicit design knowledge for planning or revising further proceedings . This activity may be better supported by providing both spatial visualizations and informal navigation techniques instead of formal representations such as folders , lists and grids . Informal spatial visualization is considered beneficial as it supports overview and detailed views as well as direct and fluent manipulation . Through interactive representation and manipulation , spatial visualizations provide the ability for embodied reasoning as epistemic action bound to the representations that are being manipulated . The case studies within this thesis have demonstrated various ways in which digital display space can be harnessed to support this embodied activity . It was demonstrated how multiple displays may be connected and controlled within a virtual workspace that provides both overview and detail at the same time ( see Chapter 4 ) . Physical navigation techniques supported by tangible objects such as the Focus Token further augment this theme . Additional techniques such as the ability to transfer artifacts from physical to digital representations for the purpose of group reflection and spatial tools such as automatically generated spatial visualizations ( see Chapter 5 ) or support for manual spatial arrangement ( see Chapter 6 ) are examples for augmenting existing practices with the benefits of dynamic display space . The common goal of all these techniques is the facilitation of juxtaposition , navigation and rearrangement as effective thinking tool . G3 : Support collaboration by separating individual tools and shared representations Many design situations are characterized by collaboration and social interactions that inherently influence how design is actually practiced . For supporting collaboration in design practice , a separation of individual physical tools and shared digital representations is recommended over interaction with shared digital representations only . Many design activities are characterized by alternations of individual work and shared reflection phases . Physical material is especially beneficial within individual ideation and reflection as it supports aspects of privacy and fluent handling . In collaborative situations however , shared digital representations may enhance common understanding as they are effective tools for providing reference as boundary objects . For achieving separation , the design of workspaces with explicit individual and shared territories is proposed . In addition , the need for fluent transfer mechanisms for exchanging artifacts between individual and shared workspaces is emphasized . This thesis has demonstrated several ways of achieving this separation within different design situations ( see Chapters 4 , 5 ) . The benefits of combining individual physical tools and shared digital tools are the facilitation of social dynamics and better moderation of social inhibitors . G4 : Support processes by first preserving and then augmenting existing workflows Design practices are inherently influenced by the tools used within the applied design methods . As tools are frequently appropriated to suit a particular work style or technique , a digital tool that Future Directions 216 deviates dramatically from established practices may have entirely different consequences . To ensure compatibility with existing embodied design practices , digital tools should be designed with the primary goal to preserve the process characteristics of existing methods . Thereafter , augmentation of this method with digital technology is possible . This procedure ensures that workflows are not entirely altered , but extended through technology where applicable and useful . This strategy of careful extension is recommended over alternative approaches that entirely replace existing workflows with digital counterparts that however make for an entire different work practice . Although a viable strategy for inventing new and revolutionary digital design tools , this strategy is not recommended for the design of tools to support embodied practices . Within this thesis , this design approach has been demonstrated through a tradeoff - driven design methodology that may be used as a tool to reflect upon design decisions within the spectrum from preserving up to augmenting . Within all three case studies it was demonstrated that the methodology can be used to apply digital augmentation thoughtfully with the goal to support real world design practices . 7 . 4 Future Directions The research presented and discussed within this thesis was part of a larger effort of advancing design tools into the emerging field of embodied interaction . While the thesis summarizes the topics that were studied most intensively by the author , three closely related case studies performed by students that were supervised by the author shall be briefly summarized . Figure 7 . 1 : Further prototype tools developed as part of this research project . Interactive collaborative storyboarding space ( left ) and simple animation storyboarding tool ( right ) ( Hankh , 2013 ; Lorenz , 2013 ) . As a thesis project , master student Markus Hankh explored the application of the proposed design guidelines for supporting embodied aspects of collaborative storyboarding ( Hankh , 2013 ) . The interactive space designed by Hankh ( see Figure 7 . 1 , left ) combines multiple individual workspaces ( tablets , interactive surfaces ) with a shared reflection space ( large interactive wall display ) . Using fluent interaction techniques for exchanging sketches across these workspaces , the system facilitates individual work and collaborative reflection as well as frequent transitions between coupling modes . A full - featured user interface integrating multi - touch and digital pen interaction is used for supporting parallel creation of sketches that can later be combined within storyboard frames and containers . A layering and templating mechanism cares for many different usage scenarios related to collaboration and successive refinement . A user study with the system indicated that the system is capable of augmenting the storyboarding process through digital features such as sharing , replication and copy & paste by still preserving some embodied aspects of traditional design practices . Master student Laura Lorenz extended the interactive storyboarding space through the integration of informal digital animation techniques ( Lorenz , 2013 ) . By extending the tablet interface through fluent Conclusion 217 animation functionality , storyboard frames can be augmented with simple short animations such as a person moving ( see Figure 7 . 1 , right ) . The animation feature however may also be used to simulate interactive behavior of sketches interfaces such as a mouse pointer’s movement . The animation workspace was realized as an additional component of the storyboarding system . Accordingly , it augments the storyboarding method with interactive animations that extend the representational character of storyboards . Hand - drawn animations can be created through the use of multi - touch gestures and digital pen manipulations . As a result , users do not have to leave the drawing interface to access animation functionality . Rather , they can use it as an additional extension only when needed . Overall , both studies indicate that the collaborative storyboarding method may also benefit from digital augmentation . However , compared to the case studied discussed in this thesis , both student projects were not grounded in the goal to preserve existing practices . Rather , both systems provide entirely digital tools that focus on functionality that is not possible with traditional tools only . Figure 7 . 2 : Ideaflow : mobile design artifact capture and visualization ( Höhn , 2013 ) . As a further related case study , master student Stephanie Höhn developed the system Ideaflow for supporting mobile ideation and documentation scenarios in small distributed design teams ( Höhn , 2013 ) . The system is based on a smartphone application for capturing and archiving inspirational artifacts on - the - go ( see Figure 7 . 2 , top ) . Using additional meta - data , digital images , short video recordings or sketches can be added to personal and shared design artifact repositories that are stored on a central server . Similar to note - taking systems such as Evernote , Ideaflow can be used by a team of designers to instantly share and archive design knowledge . Features such as notifications and commenting however extend the approach toward improving group awareness . The Ideaflow system also has an additional component that provides dynamic spatial visualizations of the artifact repository ( see Figure 7 . 2 ) . The visualizations are designed to be used for reflection activities on large interactive wall displays . Therefore , artifacts can be visualized based on their meta - data such as author , capture time or tags ( see Figure 7 . 2 , bottom ) . During co - located design meetings and reviews , Future Directions 218 a group of collaborating designers may use these visualizations to reflect upon the results of individual ideation activities . They may however also use the visualizations for composing a common visual structure during discussion . Similar to the ArtifactBubbles case study , the Ideaflow project contributes to extending the documentation and visualization of design knowledge embedded in visual artifacts . As the additional case studies demonstrate , the design guidelines proposed within this thesis were already applied to a variety of collaborative design methods such as affinity diagramming , sketching , process mapping or storyboarding and simple animation . Consequently , future work may further extent support for other design practices and workflows . Interactive spaces such as those demonstrated in this research may be designed to care for other workflows as well by applying the proposed research methodology . Figure 7 . 3 : Flexible use of several activity - centric interactive spaces in future mixed - media design studios . However , future research may also investigate support for combined workflows or a combination of methods . By integrating the discussed prototype tools into one common workspace , the concept of a mixed - media design studio may emerge ( Geyer & Reiterer , 2012 ) . Figure 7 . 3 depicts a vision of this interactive space . Ubiquitous computing infrastructure such as the Media Room at the University of Konstanz facilitates abundant interactive display space that cares for flexible appropriation depending on the performed activities . For example , design teams may engage in ideation with hybrid sticky notes at a setup of two displays ( c . f . AffinityTable ) while another group engages in refining the notes with paper sketches at the same time ( c . f . IdeaVis ) . Interactive spatial visualizations such as those demonstrated in the ArtifactBubbles prototype may be used to document and organize the results of such sessions for further reflection . A potentially flexible and adaptive combination of these interactive spaces thus may enable scenarios of reuse and appropriation across the entire design process . Artifacts created within different interactive spaces and tools may be combined and elaborated . For example , notes or sketches created within affinity diagramming or sketching sessions could easily be reused in storyboarding activities – enabling opportunities to appropriate the tools for custom design methods and workflows . While it was not the focus of this thesis to provide such a comprehensive infrastructure , the integration of the developed tools was planned for . As the developed interactive spaces are all based on the same methodical groundwork , future research may explore the potential by building upon the existing technical and conceptual foundations .

Visualizations for supporting creative activities often make use of spatial layout techniques for design exploration and reflection . The spatial arrangement and repositioning of visual items stimulates comparisons and the exploration of variations and alternatives ( compare to spatial arrangements on traditional whiteboards or walls ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 70 Figure 3 . 3 : SILK ( left ) , DENIM ( center ) and DAMASK ( right ) . Sketch - based interfaces and spatial free - form layouts as well as Zoomable User Interfaces are considered useful for informal externalization and reflection by many researchers . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 71 Figure 3 . 4 : Clearboard ( top - left ) , Post Brainstorm ( top - right ) , ModLab ( bottom - left ) , IdeaPlayground ( bottom - right ) . Systems supporting collaborative design and reflection activities often employ large interactive displays such as interactive whiteboards . Yet , most of these approaches only support interactions by one user at a time , limiting the participation of multiple other people . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 72 Figure 3 . 5 : CoLab ( top - left ) , EDC ( top - right ) , i - LAND ( bottom ) . Multiple displays or smart rooms are used to support co - located creative collaboration by providing both individual and collaborative interaction spaces .

Design tools can also be designed to support both co - located and remote collaboration at the same time . Therefore , devices for collaborative use are combined with networking infrastructure and access to remote collaborators or synchronized design artifact repositories . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 79 Figure 3 . 10 : Power vs . reality tradeoff diagram ( Jacob et al . , 2007 ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 90 Figure 3 . 11 : Characteristics of Reality and Power may be traded against each other ( Jacob et al . , 2008 ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 91 Figure 3 . 12 : Conceptual blending is an operation between two input spaces .
