Preconditioning peripheral nerve injury allows the dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) sensory axons to regenerate beyond the injury site by promoting expression of regeneration - associated genes . We have previously shown that peripheral nerve injury increases the number of macrophages in the DRGs and that the activated macrophages are critical to the enhancement of intrinsic regeneration capacity . The present study identifies a novel chemokine signal mediated by CCL2 that links regenerating neurons with proregenerative macrophage activation . Neutralization of CCL2 abolished the neurite outgrowth activity of conditioned medium obtained from neuron – macrophage cocultures treated with cAMP . The neuron – macrophage interactions that produced outgrowth - promoting conditioned medium required CCL2 in neurons andCCR2 / CCR4inmacrophages . TheconditioningeffectswereabolishedinCCL2 - deficientmiceat3and7daftersciaticnerveinjury , but CCL2 was dispensable for the initial growth response and upregulation of GAP - 43 at the 1 d time point . Intraganglionic injection of CCL2 mimicked conditioning injury by mobilizing M2 - like macrophages . Finally , overexpression of CCL2 in DRGs promoted sensory axon regeneration in a rat spinal cord injury model without harmful side effects .

This is in part because an inhospitable environment at the injury site actively inhibits axon growth by producing growth - inhibitory molecules ( Filbin , 2003 ; Silver and Miller , 2004 ; Lang etal . , 2015 ) .

However , preconditioning peripheral nerve injury enables dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons to regenerate central axons beyond spinal lesion . The exact mechanism by which the conditioning injury enhances axon regeneration capacity remains elusive . We report here that neuronal CCL2 induced by conditioning injury mediates neuron – macrophage interactions , resulting in accumulation of perineuronal macrophages with a proregenerative phe - notype . Genetic or immunological inhibition of CCL2 abolished conditioning effects in vitro and in vivo , indicating that CCL2 - mediated activation of proregenerative macrophages is essential in the conditioning injury - induced enhanced regenerative capacity . Intraganglionic CCL2 gene delivery recapitulates conditioning effects after spinal cord injury , suggesting that a chemo - kine signal mediating neuron – macrophage interaction may be a novel target for axon regeneration therapeutics . 15934 • TheJournalofNeuroscience , December2 , 2015 • 35 ( 48 ) : 15934 – 15947 ( Moore et al . , 2009 ; Park et al . , 2010 ; O’Donovan et al . , 2014 ) . The intrinsic axon regeneration capacity may be constrained by the ability of neurons to express regeneration - associated genes ( RAGs ) . The necessity of neuronal RAG expression for axon re - generation is exemplified in the conditioning injury model , in which a preceding injury to the peripheral nerve upregulates ex - pression of RAGs in the dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) sensory neu - rons and thereby enhances regeneration of their central branches in the spinal cord ( Richardson and Issa , 1984 ; Smith and Skene , 1997 ; Neumann and Woolf , 1999 ) . Recent studies have provided novel insights into how a peripheral nerve injury triggers RAG expression in the nuclei of the DRG sensory neurons . Axotomy generates various retrograde signals being transmitted to the cell bodies ( Rishal and Fainzilber , 2014 ) and the retrograde injury signals elicit epigenetic modifications of RAGs , triggering initia - tion of their transcription ( Cho et al . , 2013 ; Finelli et al . , 2013 ; Puttagunta et al . , 2014 ) . However , these mechanisms may not fully explain how over weeks or even months enhanced RAG expression can be maintained , thus allowing axons to achieve sustained elongation through and beyond the injury site ( Neu - mann and Woolf , 1999 ; Ylera et al . , 2009 ; Blesch et al . , 2012 ) . There is growing evidence that innate immunity can boost endogenous mechanisms in axon regeneration ( Gensel et al . , 2012 ) . Several studies have demonstrated that chemically acti - vated macrophages near neuronal cell bodies can exert potent effects on axon regeneration ( Yin et al . , 2003 ; Hauk et al . , 2010 ; Baldwin et al . , 2015 ) . However , it is not known whether endoge - nous signaling processes commensurate to those induced by chemical activation exist . Previous studies have shown that pre - conditioning peripheral nerve injury induces accumulation of macrophages around sensory neurons in the DRGs and that the activated macrophages may play a role in enhancing intrinsic regenerative capacity ( Lu and Richardson , 1991 , 1993 ; Niemi et al . , 2013 ) . Our previous study also suggested that a conditioning peripheral nerve injury may elicit neuron – macrophage interac - tions in the DRGs to drive macrophage activation toward a pro - regenerative phenotype ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . The present study identifies CCL2 ( also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ) as an endogenous signaling molecule that mediates neuron – macrophage interactions after conditioning injury . We provide evidence that CCL2 - mediated neuron – macrophage in - teraction is required for amplification and maintenance , but not for initial induction of enhancement of regenerative capacity by conditioning injury . Furthermore , our finding that CCL2 signal - ing can mimic the conditioning effects suggests that chemokine - mediated neuron – macrophage interactions may be a novel target to promote axon regeneration after CNS injury . Materials and Methods Animals . Adult female Sprague Dawley rats ( 250 – 300 g ) and C57BL / 6 wild - type ( WT ) mice were purchased from Orient Bio . CCL2 - deficient and CCR2 - deficient mice on C57BL / 6 background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory . The Institutional Animal Care and Use Com - mittee of Ajou University School of Medicine approved all animal protocols . Surgical procedures . Animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate ( 400 mg / kg , i . p . ) during all the surgical procedures . After being dissected and exposed , the right sciatic nerve was ligated proximal to its trifurca - tion and cut below the ligation site with fine surgical scissors . To create a dorsal column lesion in the spinal cord , a dorsal laminectomy was per - formed at the T7 level and bilateral dorsal columns with adjacent lateral columns were cut out with iridectomy scissors . To visualize regenerating axons , cholera toxin subunit B ( CTB ; List Biological Laboratories ) was injected using a protocol modified slightly from that in the previous report ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . After the sciatic nerve between the thigh muscles was exposed , a small incision was made on the perineurium just proximal to the trifurcation site . Four microliters of unconjugated CTB solution ( 0 . 1 % in PBS ) were slowly injected using the Hamilton syringe through the perineural incision and animals were killed 5 d after the injection . For intraganglionic injection , the L5 DRG was exposed after removal of the lateral process of the L5 vertebral bone . A Hamilton syringe configured with a glass pipette was controlled using a microma - nipulator , and the tip of the glass pipette was slowly advanced into the L5 DRG under a surgical microscope . Two microliters of recombinant chemokines ( 250 (cid:2) g / ml ; R & D Systems ) or CCL2 - neutralizing antibody ( 200 (cid:2) g / ml ; R & D Systems ) were injected into the L5 DRG at a rate of 0 . 5 (cid:2) l / min using a nanoinjector . Preparation and injection of adeno - associated virus serotype 5 with a CCL2 expression cassette . The recombinant adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) vector containing a CCL2 expression cassette was generated by replacing the GFP cassette of pAAV - CAG - GFP ( Addgene ) with the full - length cDNA for rat CCL2 ( OriGene ) . AAV serotype 5 ( AAV5 ) virus preparation was performed by the University of North Carolina at Cha - pelHillVectorCorefacility . ControlAAV5 - GFPwaspurchasedfromthe same facility . The titer of both viruses was (cid:2) 1 (cid:3) 10 16 vector genome copies / ml . Two microliters of AAV5 - GFP or AAV5 - CCL2 were injected intotheL5DRGatarateof0 . 5 (cid:2) l / minusingthemethoddescribedabove for intraganglionic injection of recombinant chemokines or neutralizing antibodies . PrimarycultureofdissociatedadultDRGneuronsandneuriteoutgrowth assay . DRGs were freshly dissected and treated with 125 U / ml type XI collagenase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in DMEM ( Hyclone ) for 90 min at 37 ° C with gentle rotation . After washing five times with DMEM , the cells were dissociated by trituration using a pipette tip and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min . Cell pellets were resuspended in Neurobasal - A ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with B - 27 ( Invitrogen ) and plated onto eight - well culture slides ( BD Biosciences ) precoated with 0 . 01 % poly - D - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and3 (cid:2) g / mllaminin ( Invitrogen ) . Neuronsfrom asingleL5DRGofoneratorfromtheL4 , L5 , andL6DRGsofonemouse were cultured in a single well . The culture duration was strictly limited to 15 h , at which point there is minimal neurite outgrowth in the control condition ( without conditioning injury ) . Neurite outgrowth was visual - ized by immunostaining with mouse anti - (cid:3) III tubulin ( 1 : 1000 ; Promega ) followed by an Alexa 594 - conjugated anti - mouse secondary antibody ( Invitrogen ) . Primary macrophage culture and neuron – macrophage coculture . To harvest peritoneal macrophages , adult rats or mice were anesthetized with an overdose of chloral hydrate . Immediately after sacrificing the animals by cervical dislocation , peritoneal macrophages were harvested byintraperitoneallavagewith50or20mlofice - coldPBSforratsormice , respectively . The lavage fluid was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the cells . The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer ( Qiagen ) for 3 min at room temperature and then washed three times using PBS . After the final wash , the cells were resus - pended in RPMI - 1640 ( Hyclone ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , plated onto a 100 mm culture dish or six - well plate ( BD Biosci - ences ) coated with 0 . 01 % poly - D - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and main - tained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO 2 . To investigate phenotypic changes in macrophages in response to chemokine treat - ment , macrophage cultures were allowed to stabilize for 4 h after plating andthentreatedwithrecombinantchemokinesataconcentrationof100 (cid:2) M for 24 h . To establish neuron – macrophage cocultures , dissociated DRG neurons were incubated in a six - well plate with DMEM supple - mented with B - 27 for 4 h . Then , peritoneal macrophages were plated on top of neurons at a ratio of 1 : 5 ( neurons to macrophages ) . Four hours after macrophage plating , the neuron – macrophage cocultures were treatedwithdibutyryl - cAMP ( db - cAMP ; 100 (cid:2) M ; Calbiochem ) orPBSas Theauthorsdeclarenocompetingfinancialinterests .

The cocultures were maintained for 72 h with - out changing the medium and then the conditioned medium ( CM ) was collected , centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min , and passed through a 0 . 2 (cid:2) m filter ( BD Biosciences ) to remove any remaining cellular debris . For neurite outgrowth assays with CM , primary dissociated DRG neuron cultures were established in eight - well culture slides as described above and maintained in culture for 2 h to allow for attachment to the culture dishes before replacing the medium with the collected CM . After 15 h in culture , the cells were fixed and immunostained for (cid:3) III tubulin to visualize neurite outgrowth . To neutralize CCL2 in the coculture condi - tion , CCL2 - neutralizingantibodiesorcontrolnonimmunegoatIgGs ( 20 ng / ml ; R & D Systems ) were added during both the 24 h treatment with db - cAMP and during the 72 h medium - conditioning period . To test whether CCR4 is involved in the CCL2 - mediated neuron – macrophage interaction , 0 . 1 (cid:2) M C 021 dihydrochloride ( # 3581 , Tocris ) , CCR4 inhib - itor , was added during the cocultures composed of WT neurons and CCR2 - deficient macrophages . Real - time RT - PCR and ELISA . Total RNAs were extracted from dis - sected DRGs or cultured cells using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . To obtain the DRGs , animals were anes - thetized with an overdose of chloral hydrate and briefly perfused with ice - cold saline to remove blood components from the tissue . The L4 and L5 DRGs were quickly dissected and the spinal nerves attached to the DRGs were carefully removed . Dissected DRGs were frozen rap - idly and stored at (cid:4) 70 .

The L4 and L5 DRGs were quickly dissected 0 , 1 , 3 , and 7 d after SNI . Dissected DRGs were frozen rapidly and stored at (cid:4) 70°C until use . Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Tissue Mini kit ( Qiagen ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was obtained from purified RNA using the RT 2 First Strand Kit ( Qiagen ) provided with the PCR array kit . Two micrograms of cDNA template mixed with PCR master mix were dispensed in each well and real - timePCRwasperformedusingtheAppliedBiosystems7500system . Three independent arrays ( three animals ) were performed for each con - dition [ 0 ( control ) , 1 , 3 , and 7 d after SNI ] and the average array value compared with the control condition was obtained . The k - means clus - tering algorithm was used to cluster genes with a similar temporal ex - pression pattern using the MultiExperiment Viewer software ( Saeed et al . , 2006 ) . Magnetic - activated cell sorting for isolation of macrophages from DRGs . L4 and L5 DRGs were dissected and dissociated with collagenase in DMEM as described above for the neuron cultures . Cells were centri - fuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min at 4°C and washed with magnetic - activated cell sorting ( MACS ) buffer ( 0 . 5 % BSA , 2 m M EDTA in PBS without divalent ions , pH 7 . 2 ) . Cell suspensions were incubated for 15 min on ice with biotin - conjugated primary antibodies against CD68 ( 1 : 100 ; Ab - cam ) , which is found in the cytoplasmic granules of the cells in the macrophage lineage , and then incubated with avidin - conjugated mi - crobeads ( MiltenyiBiotec ) for10minonice . Then , cellsuspensionswere allowedtoflowthroughtheminicolumnoftheMACSCellSeparationkit ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . The flow - through was collected as CD68 - negative cells . CD68 - positive cells adsorbed to the minicolumn were eluted using 500 (cid:2) l of MACS buffer . Total RNA was extracted from each fraction using the methods described above . Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry . Rats were anesthetized with an overdose of chloral hydrate and perfused with heparinized PBS followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in 0 . 2 M phosphate buffer . DRGs or spinal cord tissues containing the lesion site were dissected and postfixedin4 % PFAfor2h , followedbycryoprotectioninagradedseries of sucrose solutions . DRGs were cryosectioned at a thickness of 20 (cid:2) m . For spinal cord tissue , 20 - (cid:2) m - thick parasagittal cryosections were cut . Tissue sections were mounted onto SuperFrost Plus slides ( Fisher Scien - tific ) and stored at (cid:4) 20°C until use . For immunohistochemistry , tissue sectionsweretreatedwith10 % normalserumand0 . 3 % TritonX - 100for 1 h , and then primary antibodies dissolved in the same blocking solution were applied at 4°C overnight . The primary antibodies were rabbit anti - Iba1 ( 1 : 500 ; Wako ) , rabbit anti - CCL2 ( 1 : 1000 ; Abcam ) , mouse anti - calcitonin gene - related peptide ( anti - CGRP ; 1 : 1000 ; Abcam ) , rabbit anti - GAP - 43 ( 1 : 100 ; Millipore ) , rabbit anti - phospho c - Jun ( 1 : 100 ; Mil - lipore ) , rabbit anti - phospho - STAT3 ( 1 : 100 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , and goat anti - CTB ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; List Biological Laboratories ) . Tissue sec - tions were washed thoroughly and then incubated with appropriate sec - ondaryantibodiestaggedwithAlexaFluor488or594 ( 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen ) for 1 h at room temperature . For visualization of the CTB tracing signal in the spinal cord sections , biotinylated anti - goat IgGs ( Vector Labora - tories ) followed by Alexa 594 streptavidin conjugates ( Invitrogen ) were applied after primary antibody application . The immunoreactive signals wereamplifiedusingaTyramideSignalAmplificationKit ( PerkinElmer ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The images were taken using an FV 300 confocal microscope ( Olympus ) . Quantitative image analysis . For neurite outgrowth assays , neurite length was measured using the NeuronJ plugin for the image analysis softwaresuiteImageJ . Eachwellinaneight - wellcultureslidewasdivided intofourquadrants , anda200 (cid:3) magnificationimagewasobtainedatthe center of each quadrant ( four images in each well ) . Neurites were traced for all neurons in each image and the number of DRG neurons per image was counted . There were (cid:2) 20 neurons per image and , therefore , (cid:2) 80 neurons were measured for each well . The average neurite length per neuron in each well was calculated by dividing the total neurite length by the number of neurons . The average group values for neurite length per neuron were obtained by averaging values from three to four indepen - dent cultures . To quantify the number of macrophages in DRGs , the number of macrophages in DRGs was quantified in images of Iba1 - immunostained tissue sections taken at 200 (cid:3) magnification . Macro - phageswerecountedinfourimagesperanimalandthetotalnumberwas divided by the area of the imaged DRG to obtain the macrophage counts per unit area . To analyze the frequency of CCL2 expression in DRG neurons with different sizes , L5 DRG neurons were classified based on thegreatestdiameterasfollows : neuronswiththediameter (cid:6) 23 (cid:2) mwere 15936 • J . Neurosci . , December2 , 2015 • 35 ( 48 ) : 15934 – 15947 Kwonetal . • CCL2inConditioningInjury counted as small , those with the diameter (cid:7) 32 (cid:2) m as large , and those between 23 and 32 (cid:2) m as medium - sized DRG neurons ( Fang et al . , 2006 ) . L5 DRG sections were immunostained doubly with NeuN and CCL2 , and the proportions of CCL2 - positive neurons in different size categories were obtained . To quantify the extent of dorsal column axon regeneration after in - jury , six consecutive parasagittal sections collected at a distance of 60 (cid:2) m from the intersection with the caudal lesion border and containing CTB - traced axons were used for analysis . In each section , images were captured at 200 (cid:3) magnification covering from 5 mm caudal to 5 mm rostraltothelesionsite . Amontageimagewasgeneratedusingtheimage - montaging module installed in the Neurolucida system ( MBF Biosci - ences ) . AfterthecaudallesionborderwasidentifiedusingGFAPstaining , regenerating axons beyond the lesion border in each section were recon - structed using Photoshop software and overlaid onto a virtual section image comprising the spinal cord contour and lesion border recon - structedfromthethirdorfourthparasagittalsection . Then , thelengthsof allreconstructedaxonsfromthesixsectionsinthecompositeimageweresummedtogeneratethetotallengthofregeneratingaxonsineachani - mal . In addition , the greatest distance of regenerating axon beyond the caudal lesion border was recorded for each animal and averaged for each group . The extent of regeneration was also evaluated by counting the number of axons at increasing distances from the lesion site . In each parasagittal section , lines perpendicular to the longitudinal axis were drawn at 200 (cid:2) m intervals from the lower lesion border to delineate counting blocks , with blocks named according to their shortest distance to the lesion border ( for example , the number of axons between (cid:8) 200 and (cid:8) 400 was recorded as the value in the (cid:8) 200 block ) . The number of CTB - positive axons between successive lines was counted and recorded as the number of axons in the block . The number of axons in each of the six sections was summed for each animal . Measurement of pain - perception threshold . The threshold for heat per - ception was quantified by measuring foot - withdrawal latency to heat stimulation ( 56°C ) applied to the plantar surface of the hindpaw 14 and 28dafterintraganglionicinjectionofAAV5 - GFPorAAV5 - CCL2 . Sham - operated animals were subjected to laminectomy , but did not receive contusion injury . Approximately 10 min before testing , rats were placed inaclear , open - toppedacryliccylinder ( 30cmheight (cid:3) 15cmdiameter ) on the unheated plate ( JD - A - 10A , Jeungdo Bio & Plant ) to become fa - miliarizedwiththeenvironment . Themaximumlatencywassetas25sto prevent potential injury . The withdrawal latency was defined as the elapsed time , in seconds , from stimulus onset to paw withdrawal . The latencies were averaged over three trials with each trial separated by a 5 min interval . The mechanical paw - withdrawal threshold was measured using a Von Frey test . Fourteen and 28 d after intraganglionic injection , animals were placed on an elevated wire grid and Von Frey hairs with forces in a log increment ( 0 . 45 , 0 . 74 , 1 . 26 , 2 , 3 . 3 , 5 , 8 , and 15 g ) were prepared . AVonFreyhairwasappliedsixtimesfor10seachtotheregion between the footpads in the plantar aspect of the hindpaw . The 2 g of stimulus hair was applied first and , if a negative response occurred in (cid:7) 50 % of the applications , the Von Frey hair with the next higher force wasapplied .

Statistical analysis . All numerical values and error bars in the quan - tification graphs are expressed as mean (cid:9) SEM . Statistical compari - son of mean values was performed using unpaired Student’s t tests or one - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc tests . Quantification graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism version 5 . 00 ( GraphPad Software ) . Results Identification of CCL2 as a mediator for neuron – macrophage interactions after conditioning injury We have previously shown that macrophage activation in DRGs is critically important in maintaining enhanced regenerative ca - pacity after conditioning injury . We hypothesized that injury sig - nals transmitted to DRG neurons lead to the production of moleculeswithchemokineactivitythatthenrecruitmacrophagestoDRGs . To identify potential chemokine molecules mediating these effects , we used a PCR array to examine the expression of 84 genes related to known chemokines and chemotactic activities or chemokine receptors in mRNAs obtained from DRGs at different timepointsafterSNI . Weperformedtheassayat1 , 3 , and7dafter SNI and more than two - thirds of the genes showed upregulation at any of the three time points . Using k - means clustering analysis , the 84 genes were classified into different clusters based on the similarity of their temporal patterns of expression . Because obvi - ous increase in macrophage number was observed as early as 3 d after injury ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) , we reasoned that the relevant chemokineexpressionwouldoccurearlierthanthe3dtimepointandfocusedontheclusterofgenesupregulated1dafterSNI ( Fig . 1 A ) . Of the genes belonging to this cluster , CCL2 showed the most robust expression . Real - time PCR confirmed the upregula - tion of the CCL2 gene at the 1 and 3 d time points ( Fig . 1 B ) . Immunohistochemistry revealed CCL2 protein expression pre - dominantly localized in DRG neurons at 1 d after SNI ( Fig . 1 C , D ) . In contrast , CCL2 expression was not observed after in - jury to the central branches ( dorsal column injury or rhizotomy ; Fig . 1 E , F ) . We found that upregulation of CCL2 occurred predominantly in medium or large DRG neurons . CCL2 ex - pression was observed in 52 . 3 (cid:9) 0 . 5 % and 38 . 5 (cid:9) 2 . 1 % of medium and large DRG neurons , respectively . However , only 7 . 0 (cid:9) 0 . 7 % of small DRG neurons were colocalized with CCL2 at 1 d after SNI . In our previous study , intraganglionic injection of cAMP also resulted in an increase in macrophages ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , CM from neuron – macrophage cocul - tures treated with cAMP robustly promoted neurite out - growth . We found that cultured DRG neurons increased CCL2 mRNA in response to db - cAMP treatment ( Fig . 2 A ) and the concentration of CCL2 protein in the media was increased accordingly ( Fig . 2 B ) . Treatment of db - cAMP in the neuron – macrophage cocultures increased the CCL2 protein concen - tration in the media to a comparable extent . However , cAMP treatment in cultured macrophages only slightly increased the CCL2 level , suggesting that , in the coculture condition , CCL2 is primarily induced in and secreted from neurons . Next , we examined whether CCL2 plays a functional role in mediating neuron – macrophage interaction in the coculture system . Most of the cultured DRG neurons treated with CM obtained from the cocultures treated with PBS did not grow neurites for 15 h of culture duration ( Fig . 2 C ) . However , DRG neurons treated with CM from db - cAMP - treated cocultures showed extensive neurite outgrowth . CCL2 - neutralizing antibodies were added to the coculture system together with db - cAMP , and the CM was tested for neurite outgrowth activity . We found that treatment with CCL2 - neutralizing antibodies pro - foundly attenuated the neurite outgrowth activity of the CM ( Fig . 2 C , D ) . Because the CCL2 - neutralizing antibodies were not removed from the collected CM , the attenuation of neurite outgrowth activity could be due to a direct effect of CCL2 on neurite outgrowth of cultured DRG neurons . To rule out this possibility , CCL2 - neutralizing antibodies were added to DRG neuron cultures grown in CM obtained from cocultures treated with db - cAMP alone . The addition of the CCL2 - neutralizing antibodies did not affect the neurite outgrowth activity of the CM ( Fig . 2 C , E ) , indicating that CCL2 mediates neuron – macrophage interaction in the cocultures stimulated by cAMP rather than directly affecting neurite outgrowth .

Neurosci . , December2 , 2015 • 35 ( 48 ) : 15934 – 15947 • 15937 The in vitro neuron – macrophage interactions driving the proregenerative macrophage phenotype require CCL2 in neurons and CCR2 in macrophages Various cells types can produce CCL2 in nervous tissue ( Dewald et al . , 2005 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . We wanted to confirm that CCL2 derived from neurons mediates neuron – macrophage interac - tions leading to production of proregenerative factors . As was shown in cultures using rat cells , CM obtained from cocultures of neurons and macrophages from WT mice treated with db - cAMP induced robust neurite outgrowth activity ( Fig . 3 A , B ) . In con - trast , CM obtained from cocultures of CCL2 - deficient neurons and WT macrophages did not have neurite outgrowth activity ( Fig . 3 C , D ) . However , using CM from the reverse coculture con - dition ( WT neuron plus CCL2 - deficient macrophage ) resulted in robust neurite outgrowth of cultured DRG neurons ( Fig . 3 E , F ) . This indicates that neuronal CCL2 , but not CCL2 generated from macrophages , plays an essential role in mediating the neuron – macrophage interactions . We also set up cocultures of CCR2 - deficient neurons and WT macrophages and found that their CM had robust neurite outgrowth activity ( Fig . 3 G , H ) . However , the CM from the reverse condition ( WT neurons and CCR2 - deficient macrophages ) had substantially attenuated , but not to - tally abolished , neurite outgrowth activity ( Fig . 3 I , J ) . The remaining neurite outgrowth activity is probably meditated by CCR4 , which can also bind CCL2 ( Craig and Loberg , 2006 ) . To Figure 1 .

The CM obtained from these cul - tures almost completely abolished the remaining neurite outgrowth activity . Together , these data support the idea that neuron - derived CCL2 binds to CCR2 / CCR4 receptors on mac - rophages , thus initiating signaling pathways that lead to the pro - duction of proregenerative factors . CCL2 is necessary for enhanced regenerative capacity of DRG neurons by conditioning injury We tested whether conditioning effects are abolished in CCL2 - deficient ( CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) ) mice . As expected , we could not observe increased macrophage accumulation in DRGs after SNI in CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice ( Fig . 4 A – C ) . L4 and L5 DRGs from WT or CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) micewerefreshlydissectedatdifferenttimepointsafter SNI and cultured for 15 h . In cultures from animals without SNI , there was no neurite outgrowth during this short culture period ( Fig . 4 D ) . Neurite outgrowth was clearly observed in DRG neu - rons taken from WT animals 3 and 7 d after SNI ( Fig . 4 D , F ) . The conditioning effects were appreciable even 1 d after SNI ; a small number of neurons isolated at this time point achieved substan - tial neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 4 D ) . DRG neurons obtained from CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice 3 and 7 d after SNI did not show any neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 4 E , F ) , indicating that conditioning effects were indeed abolished in CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice . Interestingly , a small subset of DRG neurons isolated from CCL2 - deficient mice 1 d after SNI showed enhanced neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 4 E ) . The percentage of neurons that grew neurites longer than twice the cell diameter was comparable in neurons isolated from WT and CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice at 1 d after SNI ( WT , 7 . 2 (cid:9) 0 . 4 % ; CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , 6 . 6 (cid:9) 0 . 4 % ) , indi - cating that CCL2 is dispensable for initial induction of condition - ing effects . Conditioning effects were also substantially reduced in CCR2 - deficient mice ( data not shown ) . At 7 d after SNI , mean neurite length of dissociated DRG neurons from CCR2 - deficient mice was 308 . 9 (cid:9) 50 . 0 (cid:2) m , (cid:6) 50 % of the length in WT neurons . However , the neurite outgrowth was more extensive than that of CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) neurons , which can also be explained by redundant binding of CCL2 to CCR4 ( Craig and Loberg , 2006 ) . We examined the expression of RAGs after SNI in CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice . In WT mice , the percentage of DRG neurons expressing GAP - 43 gradually increased after SNI ( Fig . 4 G ) , resulting in (cid:7) 80 % of the neurons being positive for GAP - 43 at the 7 d time point ( Fig . 4 I ) . In CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice , GAP - 43 expression was not observed at the 3 and 7 d time points ( Fig . 4 H , I ) , the time points at which conditioning effects were completely abrogated ( Fig . 4 E ) . However , GAP - 43 expression was clearly observed at the 1 d time point ( Fig . 4 H ) , the time point at which conditioning effects were observed to a limited degree . This result reinforces the idea that CCL2 is dispensable for initial regenerative responses trig - gered by preconditioning SNI and further suggests that CCL2 may be required to amplify and / or maintain the expression of a subset of RAGs associated with sustained promotion of axon growth potential . We also examined the expression of c - Jun , a RAG involved in early transcriptional events . In WT mice , c - Jun expression was induced 1 d after SNI , peaked at 3 d , then de - creased by 7 d to a level similar to that at the 1 d time point ( Fig . 4 J , L ) . The percentage of neurons expressing c - Jun in CCL2 - deficient mice was comparable to that in WT mice 1 d after SNI ( Fig . 4 K , L ) . Intriguingly , unlike GAP - 43 expression , c - Jun ex - pression in CCL2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice was not reduced at the 3 and 7 d time points , when neurite outgrowth activity was almost completely absent . We also observed a similar pattern of expression for STAT3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) , an - other regeneration - associated transcription factor , in CCL2 - deficient mice ( data not shown ) . The preservation of c - Jun and STAT3 expressions at these time points suggest that expressions of a subset of RAGs different from that to which GAP - 43 belongs are not influenced by CCL2 - mediated proregenerative macro - phage activation . Constitutive deletion of CCL2 should affect inflammatory reactions not only in DRGs but also at the injury site in the Figure3 .

Therefore , we also tested for an essential role of CCL2 in conditioning effects by locally injecting CCL2 - neutralizing an - tibodies into L5 DRG immediately after SNI in rats . As expected , there was a ro - bust increase of the macrophage num - ber in the L5 DRG 7 d after SNI ( Fig . 5 A , B ) and the L5 DRG neurons showed enhanced neurite outgrowth when iso - lated at this time point ( Fig . 5 C , D ) . In contrast , intraganglionic injection of CCL2 - neutralizing antibodies almost completely abrogated the enhanced neurite outgrowth capacity ( Fig . 5 C , D ) and the diminution of conditioning ef - fects was accompanied by decreased numbers of Iba1 - positive macrophages in the L5 DRG ( Fig . 5 A , B ) . CCL2 enhances axon growth potential by driving M2 macrophage polarization Next , we examined whether intragangli - onic injection of CCL2 is sufficient to enhance growth capacity mimicking conditioning injury . Injection of re - combinant CCL2 into rat L5 DRG sub - stantially increased the number of macrophages in the DRG 7 d after injec - tion ( Fig . 6 A , C ) . CCL2 injection was in - deed sufficient to enhance neurite outgrowth of cultured L5 DRG neurons isolated 7 d after injection ( Fig . 6 B , D ) . The enhancement of regenerative ca - pacity after SNI might be achieved by any chemokine molecule that can re - cruit macrophages to DRGs rather than by CCL2 specifically . This possibility was tested by injecting other chemo - kines with macrophage - recruiting ac - tivity into the L5 DRG . We chose CX3CL1 ( fractalkine ) and CCL3 ( MIP1 - (cid:4) ) because both of these chemo - kines can be produced by neurons and can recruit macrophages into the CNS ( Olszewski et al . , 2000 ; Tong et al . , 2000 ; Kuijpers et al . , 2010 ) . In our chemokine PCR array experiment , CX3CL1 be - longed to the chemokine cluster show - ing no increase or a slight decrease , and CCL3 belonged to the cluster showing increase in expression level 3 d after SNI ( data not shown ) . The number of mac - rophages in L5 DRGs was increased by intraganglionic injec - tion of recombinant CX3CL1 or CCL3 ( Fig . 6 A , C ) , to an extent comparable to that induced by SNI ( Fig . 5 B ) or intra - ganglionic CCL2 injection ( Fig . 6 C ) . However , there was no neurite outgrowth in cultures of DRG neurons isolated 7 d after intraganglionic injection with either CX3CL1 or CCL3 ( Fig . 6 B , D ) . Therefore , the macrophages recruited by either CX3CL1 or CCL3 do not seem to have the ability to enhance the regenerative capacity of DRG sensory neurons . The above results suggest a possibility that the phenotype of macrophages induced by CCL2 is different from that induced by CX3CL1 or CCL3 . To test this idea , cultured macrophages were treated with CCL2 , CX3CL1 , or CCL3 for 24 h and the expression of various markers of the two main macrophage polarization types , M1 and M2 , was examined ( Fig . 6 E ) .

In contrast , both CX3CL1 - treated and CCL3 - treated macrophages showed enhanced expression of some of these M1 markers : iNOS and IL - 2 were elevated following CX3CL1 treatment and CD16 , CD32 , and iNOS increased after CCL3 treatment . When the ex - pression of M2 markers was evaluated , only CCL2 increased the expression of any of these genes ( CD206 and arginase - 1 ) . We also examined the expression of M1 and M2 markers in the MACS - separatedmacrophagesinDRGsatdifferenttimepointsafterSNI ( Fig . 6 F ) . The CD68 - positive fraction was devoid of MAP - 2 gene expression , while the CD68 - negative fraction expressed MAP - 2 , indicating successful separation between macrophages and neu - rons ( data not shown ) . SNI increased the expressions of the M2 markers CD206 and arginase - 1 in CD68 - positive macrophages , whereas the expression of M1 markers ( CD32 , iNOS , and IL - 2 ) was not significantly affected . These data suggest that CCL2 pro - duced by DRG neurons after SNI may not only recruit but also activate macrophages to take on the M2 phenotype . Overexpression of CCL2 enhances axon regeneration in vivo Finally , wesoughttoexaminewhetheroverexpressionofCCL2in DRGs could promote sensory axon regeneration in an in vivo spinal cord injury model . For overexpression of CCL2 in DRG sensory neurons , we chose to use AAV5 based on a previous study reporting that AAV5 is the most efficient serotype for transduc - ing DRG neurons in vivo ( Mason et al . , 2010 ) . The efficiency of AAV5 in transduction of DRG neurons was tested in our model . AAV5 - GFP viral supernatant was injected into L5 DRGs and the expression of GFP was examined 7 , 14 , and 28 d after injection ( Fig . 7 A – C ) . At the 7 d time point , very few GFP (cid:8) / NeuN (cid:8) cells were observed in the L5 DRG . However , the number of GFP (cid:8) / NeuN (cid:8) cells was substantially increased 14 and 28 d after Figure 5 .

We also confirmed that the majority of the L5 DRG neurons expressed CCL2 by 28 d after injection of AAV5 - CCL2 ( Fig . 7 D – F ) . Intraganglionic injection of AAV5 - CCL2 resulted in a significant increase in the number of macrophages at the 14 d time point compared with the macrophage number in animals with AAV - GFP injection ( Fig . 8 A , B ) . The increase was more robust 28 d after injection ( Fig . 8 A – C ) . Despite the robust in - crease in macrophages , neurofilament - positive DRG neurons seemed to be healthy without any sign of DRG tissue damage ( Fig . 8 D ) , and there was no immunoreactivity to caspase - 3 , the marker of cell death ( data not shown ) . These data indicate that the macrophages activated by AAV5 - CCL2 did not produce cy - totoxic effects . Neurite outgrowth activity of DRG neurons cul - tured 28 d after intraganglionic AAV5 - CCL2 injection was also dramatically enhanced ( Fig . 8 E , F ) . In contrast , there was no discernable neurite growth of DRG neurons injected with AAV5 - GFP . We also studied the effects of AAV5 - CCL2 on sensory axon regeneration in an in vivo spinal cord injury model . Intragangli - onic AAV5 - GFP or AAV5 - CCL2 injection was performed 7 d before spinal injury . In another group of animals , AAV5 - CCL2 was injected 1 d after spinal lesion . Regenerating sensory axons traced by CTB were examined 1 month after the spinal injury . In animals with control AAV5 - GFP injection , injured axons re - tracted a few hundred micrometers away from the caudal end of the injury site ( as determined by GFAP staining ; Fig . 9 A ) and they frequently had round and bulging tips resembling retraction bulbs ( Fig . 9 A , 2 ) .

Regenerating axonal fibers were sometimes observed several hundred micrometers rostral to the caudal in - jury border ( Fig . 9 B , arrows ) . Overexpression of CCL2 in DRG neurons did not significantly influence glial environment at the lesion site because intensity of GFAP ( astrocytes ) or Iba - 1 ( microglia ) immunostaining signals were not changed by CCL2 overexpression ( data not shown ) .

Simi - lar results were obtained in the comparison of the length of the longestregeneratingaxons ( Fig . 9 F ) orintheanalysisofthenumber of axons at different distances from the lesion epicenter ( Fig . 9 G ) . These results demonstrate that overexpression of CCL2 can lead to robustsensoryaxonregenerationfollowingspinalcordinjury , mim - icking conditioning effects . Since CCL2 is known to be a mediator of microglial activation in the dorsal horn in neuropathic pain ( Gao and Ji , 2010 ) , we com - paredtheextentofCGRPimmunoreactivityinthedorsalhornofthe lumbar spinal cord ( Fig . 10 A ) . There was no appreciable difference intheCGRPimmunoreactivityinanimalstreatedwithAAV5 - CCL2 either preinjury or postinjury and those treated with control AAV5 - GFP . Moreover , intraganglionic AAV5 - CCL2 injection , either pre - injury or postinjury , did not induce thermal ( Fig . 10 B ) or mechanical hypersensitivity ( Fig . 10 C ) . Discussion Ourpreviousstudysuggestedthatneuron – macrophageinteractions mayunderlieactivationofmacrophageswithaproregenerativephe - notype following preconditioning peripheral nerve injury ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) .

Usingthesamecoculturesystem , the present study demonstrates that CCL2 is a key mediator of the neuron – macrophage interaction driving the proregenerative mac - rophage phenotype . CCL2 was identified as a candidate mediator by screening for chemokines and related molecules whose expression was regulated be - forethepeakofmacrophageactivationafterpreconditioningSNI . Con - firming the activity of CCL2 as a neuron – macrophage interaction mediator in the coculture system , CCL2 - neutralizing antibodies abol - ishedtheproregenerativeactivityofCMwhenappliedduringthecocul - ture period , but not when used during the neurite outgrowth assay . Several lines of evidence indicated that the neurons were the source of CCL2mediatingtheneuron – macrophageinteractions .

Moreevidently , cAMPfailedto produce proregenerative CM when CCL2 - deficient neurons were cocultured with WT macrophages , while the CM obtained from the reverse coculture condition had vigorous neurite out - growth activity . In vivo , CCL2 expression was confined to the DRG sensory neurons following SNI . These results are in accor - dance with previous studies demonstrating upregulation of CCL2 expression by neurons following injuries to the peripheral nerves in various chronic pain models ( Tanaka et al . , 2004 ; Zhang and De Koninck , 2006 ; Jeon et al . , 2009 ) . CCL2 signals through its cognate receptor , CCR2 . Released CCL2 activates neuronal CCR2 receptors in neuropathic pain models ( Jung and Miller , 2008 ; Jung et al . , 2008 ) . However , neuronal CCR2 was dispensable for the cAMP - triggered neuron – macrophage interaction in our system : cAMP - treated cocultures of CCR2 - deficient neurons and WT macrophages still produced proregen - erative CM . Instead , macrophage expression of CCR2 was required as proregenerative activity was significantly attenuated when cocultures of WT neurons and CCR2 - deficient macro - phages were treated with cAMP . Thus in our system , CCL2 re - leased from neurons activates CCR2 in macrophages to drive them to a proregenerative phenotype . In CCL2 - deficient mice , conditioning effects were pre - served 1 d after SNI but the enhanced regenerative capacity of neurons was almost completely abrogated at later time points , Figure10 .

At the very early time point , a very small number of neurons from CCL2 - deficient mice grew significant neurites and the percentage of neurons bearing neurites was comparable to that of neurons from WT mice . This is consistent with our previous study in which infusion of a macrophage deactivator , minocycline , to the DRG was not effective in abrogating the regenerative response at 1 d after SNI ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . These findings suggest that initial regenerative responses are triggered independently of macrophages and inflammatory reactions in the DRGs . In support of this notion , we found unambiguous activation of two RAGs , c - Jun and GAP - 43 , in DRG neurons at 1 d in both WT and CCL2 - deficient mice . Interestingly , however , the expression patterns of the two RAGs were dissociated at the 3 d time point , when neurite outgrowth in cultures of neurons from the CCL2 - deficient mice was almost absent . The preservation of c - Jun activation in CCL2 - deficient mice suggests that c - Jun and related signal - ing processes function at a level upstream of CCL2 . In con - trast , the loss of GAP - 43 expression and diminished capacity for axon growth at the later time points indicate that both require CCL2 signaling for amplification and / or maintenance after the 1 d time point . Based on these observations , we propose a model in which a mechanism linking axotomy - induced retrograde injury sig - nals and CCL2 upregulation plays a critical role in amplifying and / or maintaining regenerative capacity ( Fig . 11 ) . One or more RAGs ( for example , c - Jun or STAT3 ) induce upregula - tion of CCL2 in response to the retrograde injury signals ( Fig . 11 A , B , RAG x ) . The initial regenerative responses or expres - sion of a subset of RAGs ( for example , GAP - 43 ) are not sustained without CCL2 from injured DRG neurons . Macro - phages activated by CCL2 render the microenvironment sur - rounding the DRG neurons supportive of amplification and / or maintenance of the expression of RAGs and the regen - erative capacity of the neurons ( Fig . 11 C ) . This growth - supportive perineuronal microenvironment may persist for (cid:7) 1 month , since our previous study found an increase in macrophages up to (cid:5) 4 weeks after SNI ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we postulate that axotomy - induced CCL2 upregu - lation and ensuing perineuronal macrophage activation plays a critical role in the long - term maintenance of the enhance - ment of regenerative capacity that occurs after conditioning injury ( Ylera et al . , 2009 ; Blesch et al . , 2012 ) . Macrophages can be polarized into different functional phe - notypes in response to different environmental cues ( Murray et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . It has been proposed that M2 - polarized macrophages make essential contributions to neural repair processes , such as neurogenesis , angiogenesis , remyelina - tion , and axon regeneration ( Kigerl et al . , 2009 ; Hu et al . , 2015 ) . CCL2 can polarize macrophages to acquire M2 phenotypes in non - neural environments ( Sierra - Filardi et al . , 2014 ; Lee et al . , 2015 ) , as well as in the contused spinal cord ( Gadani et al . , 2015 ) . A recent study also reported that CCL2 , in combination with ectodomain of sialic acid - binding Ig - like lectin - 9 , promotes the M2 - like differentiation of macrophages producing CM with ro - bust neurite outgrowth activity ( Matsubara et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we demonstrated that CCL2 treatment drove the M2 phenotype , whereas CCL3 or CXCL1 , both of which failed to enhance axon growth capacity after intraganglionic injection , increased the expression of genes associated with the M1 phenotype . This ob - servation indicates that CCL2 functions not only to recruit mac - rophages but also to stimulate an M2 phenotype and this M2 polarization may be essential in the regeneration - promoting ef - fects of conditioning injury . The present study demonstrated that chemokine - mediated macrophage activation has therapeutic potential to enhance axon regeneration following spinal cord injury . Most promis - ing was the finding that postinjury CCL2 activation was as beneficial as preinjury intervention . This is in accordance with studies showing that conditioning injury enhances regenera - tive responses whether the conditioning injury procedure is performed before or after the central lesion ( Kadoya et al . , 2009 ; Ylera et al . , 2009 ) . Our finding that overexpression of CCL2 postinjury mimicked conditioning effects suggests that any therapeutic strategy aimed at boosting RAG expression would be effective when instituted after a central injury ( as is the case in all clinical situations ) . Importantly , macrophage activation in the DRGs by chronic activation of CCL2 did not result in neuronal damages , whereas zymosan - induced mac - rophages produced cytotoxicity in a previous study ( Gensel et al . , 2009 ) . This discrepancy implies that the CCL2 - induced macrophage activation may be more physiologic than the chemically induced process in recapitulating the activation of macrophages and inflammatory reactions that occur follow - Figure 11 . A diagram of the proposed model for the role of CCL2 - mediated macrophage activation following preconditioning SNI . A , An axotomy at the sciatic nerve produces injury signals that are retrogradely transmitted to neurons in the DRGs . B , The injury signals induce initialactivation ( dottedblackarrows ) ofmultipleRAGs .

Neurosci . , December2 , 2015 • 35 ( 48 ) : 15934 – 15947 • 15945 ing conditioning injury and that a therapeutic use of the physiologic mechanism would avoid inflammation - related cytotoxicity . In addition to an absence of cytotoxicity , CCL2 overexpression induced no changes in the threshold for pain perception . The absence of uncontrolled growth of pain fibers suggests that the enhanced regenerative capacity induced by CCL2 - mediated macrophage activation may selectively influ - ence regeneration of injured axons and not sprouting of uninjured axons terminating at the dorsal horns . Thus , the therapeutic effects of CCL2 modulation seem to be unaccom - panied by undesirable side effects . Considering a previous report showing involvement of CCL2 in regulating macrophage responses to remove myelin debris from damaged axons ( Perrin et al . , 2005 ) , it is conceiv - able that CCL2 overexpressed in DRGs by AAV in our study might enhance myelin breakdown at the injury site and thereby enhance regeneration of injured axons . However , we could not detect obvious CCL2 immunoreactivity in the lesion epicenter at the time point when the CCL2 immunoreactivity in DRGs was evidently observed ( data not shown ) , suggesting that CCL2 overexpressed in the cell body may not be effec - tively transported to the axon terminals . Upregulation of CCL2 expression in the lesioned spinal cord or severed sciatic nerve is usually limited within several days after injury ( Ma et al . , 2002 ; Perrin et al . , 2005 ) . This suggests that acutely up - regulated CCL2 mobilizes macrophages capable of degrading myelin debris at the lesion site . Therefore , though we cannot exclude a possibility that a small amount of CCL2 may be transported to the axon terminals , it is unlikely that the po - tential CCL2 upregulation at a later period would significantly function to enhance removal of myelin debris . In addition , we could not detect any significant changes in the intensity of GFAP or Iba - 1 immunoreactivity at the lesion site in animals with CCL2 overexpression . These findings together indicate that the enhanced regeneration by CCL2 overexpression in DRGs cannot be explained by alterations in cellular and mo - lecular environment at the lesion site . In conclusion , we demonstrate that axotomy - induced CCL2 mediates neuron – macrophage interactions to drive activation of proregenerative macrophages after conditioning injury . CCL2 - mediated neuron – macrophage interactions are not required for the induction of conditioning effects but play a critical role in amplifying and / or maintaining a subset of RAG expression and enhancing regenerative capacity . Finally , chronic overexpression of CCL2 in DRGs promotes sensory axon regeneration beyond thespinallesionsitewithoutharmfulsideeffects , highlightingthe potential of chemokine - induced macrophage activation for axon - regeneration therapeutics .
