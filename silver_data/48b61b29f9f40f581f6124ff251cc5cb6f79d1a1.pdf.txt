The complex containing actin - related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 is required for the motility and integrity of yeast actin patches Dirk Winter * , Alexandre V . Podtelejnikov † , Matthias Mann † and Rong Li * Background : Structural modeling and biochemical experiments in vitro have implicated a multi - protein complex containing two actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 , as a potential actin - filament nucleation factor . This ‘Arp2 / 3 complex’ has been identified in Acanthamoeba and human cells and has been shown to localize to regions involved in actin - based motility , such as the leading edge of moving cells and the ‘tail’ of actin that forms behind the intracellular pathogen Listeria . The function of this complex in vivo has not been characterized , however , and the sequences of the non - actin - related subunits remain to be determined . Results : An Arp3 homologue from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to localize to cortical actin patches , highly motile structures that concentrate at sites of polarized growth during the yeast cell cycle . A conditional arp3 mutant allele inhibited cortical actin motility at the restrictive temperature and eventually disrupted actin patches . Most Arp3 protein is found in a multi - protein complex ; we purified this complex and determined the sequences of each of the protein subunits using a high - accuracy mass peptide - mapping technique . The proteins found in the complex are similar to those in the Acanthamoeba and human Arp2 / 3 complexes except that the yeast complex lacks a 40 kDa subunit , which is therefore not required for the structural integrity of the complex . Conclusions : The Arp2 / 3 protein complex is conserved from yeast to man , and in yeast the complex is required in vivo for the motility and integrity of cortical actin patches . We hypothesize that these patches may move by a Listeria - like mechanism driven by actin polymerization . Background One of the major mechanisms that govern actin polymerization is the control of actin nucleation sites . The formation of actin trimers , the smallest nuclei for polymer - ization , is the rate - limiting step during spontaneous fila - ment assembly [ 1 , 2 ] . Thus , cellular activities that either bypass or stimulate trimer formation should have a large influence on actin polymerization . Recently , a multi - subunit protein complex that contains two actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 , has emerged as a strong candidate for carrying out de novo nucleation of actin filaments [ 3 – 5 ] . The Arps are proteins that exhibit 30 – 60 % sequence similarity to actin , and they may nucleate actin polymeriza - tion by interacting with actin through contacts similar to those between actin subunits . Kelleher et al . [ 4 ] postulated that an Arp2 – Arp3 heterodimer in the complex may be able to interact with the ‘pointed’ ( less dynamic ) end of an actin subunit , but not the ‘barbed’ ( more dynamic ) end , and thus may nucleate actin filament growth toward the barbed end . The first biochemical evidence supporting a role for the Arp2 / 3 complex in actin nucleation comes from a recent study [ 5 ] which shows that the complex as purified from human platelets is able to stimulate actin polymeriza - tion at the surface of the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes . However , the Arp2 / 3 complex localizes throughout the actin tail of motile Listeria , not just in the region proximal to the bacteria where actin polymerization occurs [ 5 ] . Another recent study [ 6 ] has demonstrated that purified Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the side of actin filaments but does not nucleate actin polymerization in solution ; the role of this complex in actin nucleation is therefore currently controversial . Furthermore , it has not yet been possible to deplete the Arp2 / 3 complex from in vitro assay systems that support Listeria motility , nor to disrupt the Arp2 / 3 complex in vivo in human or Acanthamoeba cells , leaving the physiological function of the complex in these organisms as yet undetermined . Yeast genetics has been a powerful tool for studying the function of actin - associated proteins in vivo [ 7 ] , but the yeast actin cytoskeleton has traditionally been viewed as less dynamic than that of other eukaryotic cells , and it has therefore not been used to study motility driven by actin Address : * Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , 240 Longwood Avenue , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , USA . † Protein and Peptide Group , European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Meyerhofstrasse 1 , 69117 Heidelberg , Germany .

Two classes of structures containing actin filaments are observed in yeast cells : actin cables that per - meate the cytoplasm , and patch - like cortical structures ( which will be referred to here as actin patches ) that con - centrate at the sites of cell surface growth . Light and elec - tron microscopic analyses showed that cortical actin patches contain actin filaments [ 8 , 9 ] organized around a membrane core which often appears to be an invagination of the plasma membrane [ 10 ] . Genetic studies have further suggested a role for cortical actin patches in mem - brane - based processes , such as exocytosis and endocytosis ( for review , see [ 11 ] ) . Recent studies using green fluores - cent protein ( GFP ) revealed that actin patches move rapidly along the cortex of yeast cells [ 12 , 13 ] ; this motility is ATP - dependent , but it is probably not driven by actin - based motors because it is unaffected by mutations in any of the yeast class I or class V myosins [ 13 ] . Here , we show that the motility of cortical actin patches is inhibited by a mutation affecting the yeast Arp3 protein which is itself localized to actin patches . Most Arp3 from a soluble cell extract is associated with a high molecular weight protein complex . We have purified this complex , determined the sequences of all of the subunits , and shown that it is homologous to the Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex . Our results provide the first in vivo evidence that the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for actin - based motility , a function which may be conserved throughout eukaryotic cells . Results The Arp3 protein localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast The yeast genome sequencing project identified a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of Arp3 [ 14 ] . Work by Huang et al . [ 14 ] and our lab ( this study ) found that the ARP3 gene is essential for cell viability . To gain insight into its cellular function , we determined the localization of Arp3 protein in a yeast strain bearing Myc - epitope - tagged Arp3 as its sole copy of Arp3 . This strain grows at a similar rate to the wild - type ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the epitope tag is not detrimental to Arp3 function . Immunofluorescent anti - Myc staining revealed that Arp3 is present in patch - like structures . This staining was not seen in an identical strain containing untagged Arp3 ( data not shown ) , indicating that the staining is specific . Double staining with anti - actin and anti - Myc antibodies showed that most of the Arp3 - containing patches co - localize with actin patches , but not with actin cables ( Figure 1 ) . This result suggests that Arp3 may be involved in actin function . Generation of conditional arp3 mutants To study the cellular function of the yeast Arp3 , we used a mutagenic PCR strategy to generate conditional alleles of ARP3 ( see Materials and methods ) . Screening at 14 (cid:176) C and 37 (cid:176) C for cold and temperature sensitivity , respectively , was carried out on 647 colonies bearing mutagenized ARP3 plasmid as their sole copy of ARP3 : eight recessive temperature - sensitive and no cold - sensitive ARP3 mutants were isolated . All conditional arp3 mutants exhib - ited a range of aberrant morphologies at the restrictive temperature and did not have a uniform terminal pheno - type ( data not shown ) , indicating that Arp3 function is important for cell morphogenesis , probably at more than one stage of the cell cycle . We then focused our analysis on arp3 - 2 , an mutant that grew relatively well at room temperature ( 23 (cid:176) C ) but rapidly underwent growth defects at 37 (cid:176) C . As shown in Figure 2a , arp3 - 2 cells grew well at the permissive temperature but their growth rate was slowed after 1 hour at 37 (cid:176) C . The plating efficiency of these cells was used to assess their viability . Dilutions of arp3 - 2 and wild - type cultures were plated on YPD medium after varying periods of time at the restrictive temperature , and cells were allowed to grow into colonies at room tempera - ture . A 39 % reduction in plating efficiency was detected after 1 hour at the restrictive temperature for arp3 - 2 cells , 520 Current Biology , Vol 7 No 7 Figure 1 Arp3 protein localizes to actin patches . RLY187 ( Myc - tagged - Arp3 - expressing ) yeast cells were double - stained with a mixture of goat anti - actin and mouse anti - Myc primary antibodies , and rhodamine - conjugated anti - goat and fluorescein - conjugated anti - mouse secondary antibodies . The actin staining in three individual fields is shown in ( a , c , e ) and the Arp3 staining in the same fields is shown in ( b , d , f ) . The bar represents 10 (cid:109) m . but no decrease in viability occurred for the wild - type cells ( Figure 2b ) After 4 hours at the restrictive tempera - ture , more than 90 % of arp3 - 2 cells were unable to form colonies . These results indicate that Arp3 function is required for maintenance of viability during cell growth , and that Arp3 inactivation in the mutant strain occurs within 1 hour at the restrictive temperature . Arp3 function is required for actin - patch motility We then analyzed the effects of the arp3 - 2 mutation on cortical actin dynamics in vivo by generating wild - type and arp3 - 2 strains that expressed GFP - tagged Sac6 protein . Sac6 , a yeast fimbrin homologue , is an actin - bundling protein that localizes to cortical actin patches [ 15 , 16 ] . GFP – Sac6 protein is functional , and has previously been used for studying actin - patch movement in vivo [ 12 ] . Wild - type and arp3 - 2 strains transformed with the GFP – Sac6 expressing plasmids were grown to log phase at room temperature . Small quantities of cells were trans - ferred onto glass slides and incubated at 37 (cid:176) C for varying amounts of time . At 10 minute intervals , slides were removed from the restrictive temperature , and the cells were observed for 30 second periods using a fluorescence microscope ( for details , see Materials and methods ) . At the permissive temperature , patch motility and morphology in arp3 - 2 cells were indistinguishable from those of wild - type cells . After a shift to the restrictive temperature for 30 minutes , however , a dramatic reduction in the percentage of moving patches in arp3 - 2 cells became apparent . Figure 3a shows that the distribution of actin patches in temperature - shifted wild - type cells changed completely during a 30 second timespan , whereas the patch distribution of arp3 - 2 cells remained constant . Time - lapse microscopy indicated that the change in actin - patch distribution in wild - type cells was due to patch movement ( data not shown ) . The rate of actin - patch movement was difficult to measure because the patches constantly moved in and out of the plane of focus . Therefore , to quantify the effects of the temperature shift on patch movement , we simply deter - mined the percentage of the patches that were moving during the time of observation . Moving patches were defined as those that moved at least 1 (cid:109) m within the plane of focus or moved out of focus during a 30 second period . In wild - type cells , the temperature shift had a transient effect on the fraction of moving patches ( from ~ 90 % at 0 minutes to ~ 50 % at 30 minutes ) , but patch movement recovered to ~ 70 % after 40 minutes ( Figure 3b ) . The per - centage of moving patches in a rp3 - 2 cells , however , dropped rapidly and significantly ( from ~ 90 % at 0 minutes to ~ 10 % at 30 minutes ) after the shift to 37 (cid:176) C and did not recover at later time points . The data shown in Figure 3b are the average of two representative experiments . Slightly slower or faster effects were observed in the different experiments , causing the large error bars at the 20 minute time point , but the qualitative difference between mutant and wild - type patch movement was reproducible . Because the plating efficiency of arp3 - 2 cells decreased at the restrictive temperature ( Figure 2b ) , we wanted to address whether the loss of patch motility was simply due to cell lethality or a metabolic effect , such as ATP deple - tion . As a cell can become unable to form a colony before it is physically dead , we used the vital dye methylene blue to assess the viability of individual cells . Cells were grown in a sealed environment without aeration ( see Materials and methods ) to simulate growth under a coverslip .

( a ) Growth curves were determined by growing both strains at 23 (cid:176) C and 37 (cid:176) C in YPD and measuring OD 600 at 1 h intervals . ( b ) The plating efficiency of arp3 - 2 mutant or wild - type cells at 37 (cid:176) C was used as a measure of viability and was determined by plating dilutions of each culture on YPD plates at 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 h after the temperature shift , and counting colonies after 2 – 3 days of growth at room temperature .

Furthermore , cells that were stained with methyl - ene blue ( i . e . dead cells ) were not fluorescent and there - fore are not likely to express GFP – Sac6 ( data not shown ) . To investigate whether metabolism in arp3 - 2 cells was affected at the restrictive temperature , the rate of protein synthesis was determined by pulse - labeling with 35 S - methionine . As shown in Figure 3c , the rate of 35 S - methio - nine incorporation decreased only slightly ( to 84 % of that at t = 0 ) after 1 hour at 37 (cid:176) C . These results indicate that the effect of the arp3 - 2 mutation on actin - patch motility at the restrictive temperature is not likely to be due to a general sickness of these cells . Arp3 function is required for cortical actin organization As patch motility stops , some arp3 - 2 cells accumulate large aggregates and cables that are not motile ( Figure 3d ) ; these structures were not counted as patches . Stain - ing with phalloidin revealed that a longer inactivation of Arp3 caused severe defects in actin organization .

The lower panel in ( c ) shows superimposed 4 ¢ , 6 diamino - 2 - phenylindole and phase images of the same cell shown in the upper panel . The bar represents 10 (cid:109) m . 1 hour incubation at 37 (cid:176) C , actin patches in most ( ~ 80 % ) of the budded cells were replaced with bundle - like struc - tures ( Figure 4 ) that were similar in appearance to those previously observed in cells lacking the expression of Bee1 , a yeast protein that is homologous to the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) [ 17 ] . It was difficult to determine whether actin cables were also affected because the staining of actin cables was usually much fainter than that of actin patches . Interestingly , in most of the budded cells and even in a large fraction of the unbudded cells ( Figure 4c ) , the distribution of actin fila - ments remained polarized . These observations suggest that Arp3 is required for the assembly and organization of cortical actin filaments , but not for maintaining the polar - ity of actin distribution . Purification of the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex To determine whether Arp3 exists in a protein complex , the high - speed supernatant from cells expressing Myc - tagged Arp3 ( Arp3 - M ) was fractionated on a 5 – 20 % sucrose gradient . More than 80 % of the soluble Arp3 - M fraction - ated as an 11S complex ( Figure 5a ) . To identify biochemi - cally the proteins that associate with Arp3 , we introduced tags that contained five Myc epitopes followed by six histi - dine residues ( Arp3 - MH ) to the carboxyl terminus of Arp3 . These tags do not affect Arp3 function in vivo ( data not shown ) . We developed a procedure to purify this complex from Arp3 - MH - expressing cells ( see Materials and methods ) : the soluble extract was first fractionated by two ion - exchange columns , followed by fractionation through a nickel column which binds to the histidine tag , and then further purification by gel filtration . The Arp3 - MH - con - taining fractions were detected by immunoblotting using an anti - Myc antibody . Arp3 - MH always fractionates as a single peak during each step . After the gel - filtration column , six prominent bands of roughly equal stoichiome - try were revealed by Coomassie - blue staining of the frac - tion containing Arp3 - MH ( Figure 5b ) ; these proteins continued to co - fractionate over a mono - S column . Immunoblot analysis showed that the largest of the proteins in the Arp3 - MH - containing fraction , migrating at about 70 kDa , is Arp3 - MH . The other five proteins have molecular weights of 43 kDa , 35 kDa , 19 kDa , 18 kDa and 15 kDa , similar to the apparent molecular weights of five of the subunits of the Acanthamoeba and human Arp2 / 3 complexes . The Acanthamoeba [ 3 ] and human [ 5 ] com - plexes contain proteins of 47 kDa , 44 kDa , 40 kDa , 35 kDa , 19 kDa , 18 kDa , 13 kDa and 50 kDa , 43 kDa , 40 / 39 kDa 34 kDa , 23 kDa , 22 kDa , 19 kDa , respectively . The yeast Arp3 - containing complex therefore does not contain a 40 kDa subunit like that found in both the Acanthamoeba and human Arp2 / 3 complexes . The Stokes radius of the yeast complex , determined by gel filtration , is 5 . 3 nm , similar to that of the Acanthamoeba ( 5 . 3 nm ) and human ( 5 . 5 nm ) Arp2 / 3 complexes [ 5 , 6 ] . Identification of the subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex by mass spectrometry As the molecular weights of the non - actin - related Arp2 / 3 complex subunits are similar between the species , these proteins are likely to carry out a conserved and important function ; however , the sequences of these subunits have not yet been reported . We used a high accuracy mass - mapping technique to identify the amino - acid sequences of all yeast Arp2 / 3 complex subunits . The six Coomassie - blue - stained protein bands corresponding to the members of the complex were processed [ 18 ] and analyzed by matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization ( MALDI ) .

Short peptide sequences have been published for the 18 kDa , 19 kDa , and 35 kDa subunits of the Acan - thamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex , and these sequences are homol - ogous to regions of Arc18 , Arc19 and Arc35 , respectively ( Figure 7c – e ) . The peptide sequence for the Acanthamoeba 13 kDa subunit , which probably corresponds to Arc15 , has not been published . Database searches identified an Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of Arc15 ( Figure 7b ) . Searches of the expressed sequence tag ( EST ) database identified possible human homologues of all of the Arcs , and mouse homologues of Arc15 , 19 and 35 ( data not shown ) , indicating that the primary structures of all Arp2 / 3 complex subunits are probably conserved between species . Discussion Arp2 / 3 complex is highly conserved in eukaryotic cells We have purified the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex and identified the complete amino - acid sequences of its subunits . Molec - ular weight and sequence comparisons between the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex subunits and the corresponding subunits from other species indicated that the Arp2 / 3 complex is probably conserved throughout eukaryotic organisms . This finding provides an opportunity for studying the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex by genetic approaches in yeast . A noteworthy difference between the Acanthamoeba and yeast Arp2 / 3 complexes is the absence of a 40 kDa polypep - tide in yeast . By searching the genome database with the short peptide sequences published by Machesky et al . [ 3 ] , we have identified a putative S . cerevisiae homologue of this subunit which is also homologous to the recently published Sop2 protein from S . pombe [ 19 ] . In S . pombe cells , Sop2 protein does not localize to actin patches as Arp3 does , sug - gesting that Sop2 may not always be associated with Arp3 . In some preparations of the human complex , p40 appears to be a sub - stoichiometric component [ 5 ] . Therefore , p40 may loosely associate with Arp2 / 3 complex , or more interest - ingly , the association may be regulated . The S . cerevisiae Sop2 homologue is essential for cell viability ( D . Winter and R . Li , unpublished observations ) , indicating that its function in vivo is not dispensable . The function of Arp2 / 3 complex in vivo The association of the Arp2 / 3 complex with dynamic struc - tures , such as the pseudopods of Acanthamoeba or the actin tails of rapidly moving Listeria cells , suggested that this complex had a role in motility driven by actin polymerization [ 3 – 6 ] . The fact that both Arp2 [ 20 ] and Arp3 ( this study ) localize to the highly motile actin patches raises the possibility that the Arp2 / 3 complex may play a similar role in yeast . We used a conditional arp3 allele to test the hypothesis that the Arp2 / 3 complex may be involved in actin - patch motility . At the permissive temperature , we observed no difference in actin patch movement between wild - type and arp3 - 2 cells . After shifting to the restrictive temperature for 30 minutes , a dramatic reduction in actin - patch movement was apparent in the mutant cells . The arp3 - 2 mutation is the first mutation identified that impairs actin - patch motility . This effect is not likely to be due to a general defect in cortical actin organization , because several mutations that affect cortical actin organi - zation , including (cid:68) tpm1 , (cid:68) tpm2 [ 13 ] , (cid:68) sac6 , (cid:68) sla2 and (cid:68) aip1 ( Tim Doyle , personal communication ) , do not inhibit actin - patch motility . A direct role for Arp3 in actin - patch movement is consistent with the observations that Arp3 localizes to actin patches and that arp3 - 2 has a rapid effect on patch motility prior to any significant reduction in either cell viability or the rate of protein syn - thesis . This role in motility is likely to be fulfilled by the Arp2 / 3 complex , because most Arp3 is found associated with the complex . Arp3 inactivation eventually leads to disruption of cortical actin patches . This defect appears to occur after the cessa - tion of patch movement . The precise relationship between the defect in patch integrity and that in patch motility is not clear . The aberrant cable - like structures that accumulate in arp3 - 2 cells at the restrictive tempera - ture are similar in appearance to those structures seen in cells lacking Bee1 [ 17 ] , suggesting that Arp3 and Bee1 may be involved in the same process . We have recently demonstrated that Bee1 stimulates actin polymerization at cortical patches in a reconstituted system [ 21 ] . Interest - ingly , the amino - terminal half of Bee1 exhibits structural similarity with VASP , a protein that controls actin poly - merization during Listeria movement ( for reviews , see [ 22 , 23 ] ) . Although the primary sequence homology is limited , both proteins contain an amino - terminal WASP homology domain I [ 24 ] , followed by the G / APPPPP pro - filin - binding motifs [ 25 , 26 ] : perhaps the functional rela - tionship between Arp2 / 3 complex and Bee1 in yeast is similar to that between Arp2 / 3 complex and VASP in the Listeria system . A model for actin - patch motility in yeast There are two known types of actin - based motility : one is driven by myosin along actin filaments , and the other is driven by actin polymerization , as utilized by Listeria . It seems unlikely that yeast actin patches move by a motor - driven mechanism , because the patches do not move along apparent tracks , such as actin cables or microtubules , but move independently of one another , even when localized to the same cellular regions . This observation is consistent with the finding that actin - patch motility is not affected by mutations in any of the known class I or class V myosins in yeast [ 13 ] . The dependence of patch motility on the Arp2 / 3 complex suggests that this motility may be similar to that of Listeria . Research Paper Yeast Arp2 / 3 complex Winter et al . 525 A polymerization - driven mechanism for actin - patch motility could bypass the requirement for motors and explain the lack of apparent tracks . The rate of actin - patch movement ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 6 (cid:109) m / sec ) [ 13 ] is comparable to that of Listeria movement ( 0 . 14 – 1 . 46 (cid:109) m / sec ) [ 27 ] , suggesting that a polymerization - driven mechanism is possible . VASP binds to ActA , a Listeria surface protein and forms a complex with profilin , an actin - monomer - binding protein ( for reviews , see [ 22 , 23 ] ) . This VASP – profilin complex might locally stimulate the polymerization of actin fila - ments , which itself might be nucleated or recruited by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 5 , 23 ] . The conservation of Arp2 / 3 com - plexes , the similarity between Bee1 and VASP , and the presence of profilin in yeast [ 28 ] suggest that a similar mechanism may control actin polymerization during actin - patch movement . A new tool for rapid identification of proteins in yeast Mass spectrometric methods are now able to conclusively and rapidly link gel - separated proteins with their cognate genes in the database [ 29 ] . This analytical method is partic - ularly useful for the rapid identification of yeast proteins , as the sequencing of the genome has recently been completed [ 30 ] . Here we demonstrate that MALDI peptide - mapping with high mass - accuracy , a method that does not involve any peptide sequencing , is valuable for identifying com - plete multiprotein complexes . Tryptic peptides are mea - sured by mass and the list of measured masses is screened against the list of calculated peptide masses for each protein or open reading frame in a sequence database . The improvement in search specificity necessary for unambigu - ous identification by this method was made possible by recent advances in sample preparation , mass spectrometric instrumentation and software algorithms [ 18 , 31 ] . Combined with genetic methods , these mass spectrometric tools should be particularly powerful in yeast , as we have shown here in our studies of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Materials and methods Plasmids , strains and genetic manipulations The yeast strains and plasmids that were used are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Yeast cell culture and genetic techniques were carried out by methods described by Sherman et al . [ 32 ] . All plasmid construction was performed using standard techniques . Gene disruption of ARP3 An ARP3 disruption plasmid ( pDW4 ) was constructed in which 94 % of the coding region ( amino acids 1 – 420 ) and 32 bp sequence 5 ¢ to the open reading frame in the ARP3 gene was replaced by the HIS3 marker gene . To generate the (cid:68) arp3 strain , pDW4 was cut with Sac II and Sal I and transformed into a His – diploid yeast strain . The diploid was sporu - lated and the tetrads were dissected and analyzed : 18 tetrads showed 2 : 2 lethality , and no viable His + spores were recovered . The correct inte - gration of the disruption construct was confirmed by Southern hybridiza - tion analysis ( data not shown ) . The lethality of His + spores was rescued by pDW8 and pDW15 plasmids expressing the wild - type ARP3 . Immunofluorescence Cells were fixed directly in growth media by addition of 37 % formalde - hyde to 5 % final concentration . Immunofluorescence staining was carried out essentially as described [ 15 ] . Rhodamine - conjugated donkey anti - goat and FITC - conjugated donkey anti - mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch . Generating conditional arp3 alleles Mutagenic PCR conditions of Caldwell and Joyce [ 33 ] were used to amplify a 1 . 76 kb DNA fragment containing the entire ARP3 coding region and 250 bp and 143 bp upstream and downstream sequences respectively . A 100 (cid:109) l reaction contained 100 ng pDW3 template DNA , 125 pmol primers 5 ¢ - CGCGCGTCTAGACCTGCTAGCCG - GTTGATGTA - 3 ¢ and 5 ¢ - CGCGCGAAGCTTCAGCATTTGGGGT - TACTTGA - 3 ¢ , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM MnCl 2 , 1 mM dATP and dGTP , 0 . 2 mM dCTP and dTTP , 5 U Taq and 1 · Boehringer Taq buffer ( Boehringer Mannheim ) . The PCR product was co - transformed with Stu I and Bgl II digested pDW15 plasmid into RLY180 , and transfor - mants were selected on leucine deficient synthetic media . To select against the pDW8 plasmid containing wild - type ARP3 , 647 transfor - mants were patched onto 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) plates : 507 colonies were able to grow on 5 - FOA media . These colonies were replica - plated onto YPD plates and allowed to grow at room tempera - ture , 14 (cid:176) C and 37 (cid:176) C : nine temperature - sensitive and no cold - sensitive colonies were isolated . Plasmids were rescued and transformed into RLY1 and RLY180 to test dominance and re - examine thermosensitivity . Ultimately , eight recessive temperature - sensitive alleles were isolated . Determination of viability using methylene blue Methylene blue staining was performed essentially as described in [ 34 ] . RLY218 cells , grown to early log phase in SD media lacking uracil and tryptophan , were concentrated to 10 7 – 10 8 cells per ml . Cells were covered in mineral oil to prevent aeration and gently shaken in a 37 (cid:176) C water bath to prevent pellet formation . At each time point , an aliquot of the cells was diluted with an equal volume of 0 . 01 % methyl - ene blue / 2 % sodium citrate solution . The number of cells that were negative and positive for methylene blue staining were determined microscopically within 10 min of mixing . A minimum of 200 cells were scored per time point . Measurement of protein synthesis The rate of protein synthesis was measured as described in [ 35 ] .

Cells were covered in mineral oil to prevent aeration and gently shaken in a 37 (cid:176) C water bath to prevent pellet formation . At each time point , 200 (cid:109) l cells were removed , incubated with 1 (cid:109) Ci of 35 S methionine for 5 min , and spotted onto 3MM Whatman paper presoaked in 50 % TCA . The strips of paper were boiled and washed in 10 % TCA and 35 S - incorpo - ration was determined by liquid scintillation counting . 35 S - incorpora - tion in sodium - azide - treated cells or arp3 - 2 cells grown overnight at 37 (cid:176) C was less than 2 % of that incorporated by the untreated cells ( data not shown ) . Imaging of actin - patch movement Exponential cultures of RLY218 and RLY219 were grown at room temperature in SD media lacking uracil and resuspended in SD media lacking tryptophan and uracil prior to microscopy . Cells were concentrated to 10 7 – 10 8 per ml in the same media . For each experi - ment , a series of slides were prepared at room temperature by spot - ting 5 (cid:109) l cells on a microscope slides , covering them with a coverslip , and sealing the coverslip with Valap wax ( a 1 : 1 : 1 mix of paraffin , vaseline and wax ) . Slides were then incubated at 37 (cid:176) C for various amounts of time . At 10 min intervals , slides were removed from the 37 (cid:176) C incubation . Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Plan - APOC - HROME 63X / 1 . 40 objective on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with a CH250 / KAF - 1400 liquid - cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Photometrics ) . Image processing was performed on Metamorph 2 . 5 ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) . All movies were made within 6 min of removing slides from 37 (cid:176) C to minimize recovery . Patch movement was quantified by determining the percentage of patches present in the first frame of the movie that moved 1 (cid:109) m or more within the plane of focus or disappeared out of focus during the span of the movie . Aberrant structures that appeared in mutant cells at 37 (cid:176) C were not counted as patches . Phalloidin staining of yeast cells Cells were fixed directly in growth media by addition of 37 % formalde - hyde to 5 % final concentration . Staining with rhodamine - labeled phal - loidin ( Molecular Probes ) was carried out as described in [ 36 ] . Arp2 / 3 complex purification RLY188 cells were grown to late log phase in 9 L YPD media . Cells were washed once in and resuspended in 200 ml of 4 (cid:176) C U buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA ) sup - plemented with 0 . 2 mM ATP and 1 · protease inhibitor mix ( PI ; 0 . 5 (cid:109) g / ml of each of antipain , leupeptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , apro - tinin and 1 mM PMSF ) . This cell suspension was passed once through a French pressure cell press ( Aminco ) at 1200 psi . Membranes and cell debris were cleared by centrifugation at 40 , 000 r . p . m . in a Beckmann TI45 rotor for 2 h . The supernatant was further cleared of aggregates by passage through a 0 . 8 (cid:109) m filter ( Corning Glass Works ) . All of the column chromatography experiments were performed at 4 (cid:176) C on the BioLogic automated protein purification system ( Bio - Rad ) , except for the Ni 2 + column , which was run manually . A 260 ml extract ( 10 mg / ml ) was applied to a 80 ml Q Sepharose column ( Macro - Prep Q , Bio - Rad ) , equilibrated with U buffer + ATP + PI . This column was washed with three column volumes of U buffer + ATP + PI , and eluted with a 640 ml salt gradient ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 55 M KCl in U buffer + ATP + PI ) . Immunoblot analysis revealed that all Arp3 protein elutes between 170 and 240 mM KCl . The Arp3 - containing fractions were pooled , diluted to 50 mM KCl in H 2 O , adjusted to pH 6 . 5 with 0 . 5 M MES ( 2 - [ N - mor - pholino ] ethanesulfonic acid ) , pH 3 . 2 , and applied to a 20 ml S Sepharose column ( Bio - Rad ) , equilibrated in 25 mM MES , pH 6 . 5 , 25 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , supplemented with PI and ATP . This column was washed with four column volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a 100 ml gradient of 25 – 320 mM KCl . All detectable Arp3 eluted between 160 and 300 mM KCl . Peak fractions were pooled , adjusted to pH 7 . 5 with Tris - HCl , pH 9 . 1 , and passed over a 1 ml Ni - NTA agarose column ( Qiagen ) , equilibrated in U buffer + ATP + PI . This column was washed with 20 ml of 0 . 3 M KCl U buffer + ATP + PI , then 15 ml of 0 . 1 M KCl , and eluted in batch with 50 mM imidazole . The Arp3 - containing eluate was passed over a 1 · 120 cm gel filtration column of Sephacryl S - 300 ( Pharmacia ) . Coomassie - blue - staining indi - cated that Arp3 fractionated as a single peak of six bands of roughly equal stoichiometry . The peak fractions were diluted to 50 mM KCl , adjusted to pH 6 . 5 with MES , and passed over a UNO - S1 column Research Paper Yeast Arp2 / 3 complex Winter et al . 527 Table 2 Plasmids used in this study Plasmid Description pDW2 A 1 . 76 kb Xba I— Hind III fragment containing the complete ARP3 coding region and 250 bp upstream and 143 bp downstream sequences was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using primers 5 ¢ - CGCGCGTCTAGACCTGCTAGCCGGTTGATGTA - 3 ¢ and 5 ¢ - CGCGCGAAGCTTCAGCATTTGGGGTTACTTG - 3 ¢ and cloned into the Xba I and Hind III sites of pSK + ( this study ) . pDW4 The Stu I – Eco RI fragment of ARP3 containing 94 % of the ARP3 open reading frame was deleted from pDW2 and replaced with the YDp - H [ 42 ] HIS3 fragment ( this study ) . pDW8 The Xba I and Hind III ARP3 fragment from pDW2 was cloned into pRS316 [ 41 ] ( this study ) . pDW15 The Xba I and Hind III ARP3 fragment from pDW2 was cloned into pRS315 [ 41 ] ( this study ) . pDW16 In order to generate an in - frame Bam HI site at the 3’ end of ARP3 , a 1 . 59 kb Xba I – Bam HI fragment of ARP3 was amplified by PCR from pDW2 using primers 5 ¢ - CGCGCGTCTAGACCTGCTAGCCGGTTGATGTA - 3 ¢ and 5 ¢ - GCGCGGGATCCAACCATG - TTGAAAAGGCTG - 3 ¢ and cloned into the Xba I and Bam HI sites of pSK + ( this study ) . pDW19 The Xba I and Bam HI ARP3 fragment from pDW2 was cloned into pRL72 ( this study ) . pDW20 The Xba I and Bam HI ARP3 fragment from pDW2 was cloned into pRL122 ( this study ) . pDW25 arp3 - 2 in pRS315 [ 41 ] as generated in Materials and methods ( this study ) . pRB2140 GFP – SAC6 expressed under the ACT I promoter in a URA , CEN , ARS plasmid [ 12 ] . pRL172 A pRS315 - based [ 41 ] vector containing the same cassette as in pRL102 [ 17 ] for carboxy - terminal tagging with six Myc epitopes ( this study ) . pRL122 A pRS316 - based [ 41 ] vector for carboxy - terminal tagging with five Myc epitopes followed by six histidines ( this study ) . ( Bio - Rad ) . A 10 ml gradient of 25 – 320 mM KCl eluted these bands in a single 2 ml fraction at 170 mM KCl . Stokes radius determination The method of Siegel and Monty [ 37 ] was used to determine Stokes radius of purified Arp2 / 3 complex . A 1 · 120 cm HiPrep Sephacryl S - 300 column ( Pharmacia Biotech ) was equilibrated with U buffer . ATP marked the salt volume and blue dextran ( M r = 2 , 000 kDa ) marked the void volume . Catalase ( M r = 232 kDa ) and ferretin ( M r = 440 kDa ) from Pharmacia were used as standards . Sucrose gradient A RLY187 lysate was prepared in U buffer + ATP + PI by the liquid nitrogen grinding method [ 38 ] , and cleared by a 1 h centrifugation at 80 , 000 r . p . m . in RP100 - AT3 rotor ( Du Pont ) . A 12 ml 5 – 20 % sucrose gradient was prepared in the same buffer , and 200 (cid:109) l lysate was loaded . After a 15 h centrifugation in an SW40 rotor ( Beckman Instru - ments ) at 35 , 000 r . p . m . at 4 (cid:176) C , 0 . 75 ml fractions were collected , pre - cipitated with TCA and subjected to immunoblot analysis . Ferritin and catalase were run in parallel on an identical gradient as standards . Immunoblot analysis Immunoblotting analysis with anti - Myc and anti - actin antibodies was carried out as described in [ 17 ] . Protein identification by mass spectrometry Bands of interest were excised from the gel , washed , in - gel reduced , S - alkylated and subjected to proteolytic digestion with an excess of sequence grade trypsin ( Boehringer Mannheim ) as described [ 29 , 39 ] . A mixture of saturated solution of (cid:97) - cyano - hydroxycynnamic acid ( Sigma ) and nitrocellulose in acetone ( Bio - Rad ) were used to prepare ‘fast evaporation’ matrices for MALDI analysis [ 29 , 31 , 40 ] . After a 3 h digestion , 0 . 3 (cid:109) l digestion supernatant was removed and deposited directly into an acidified water droplet placed on top of these matrix surfaces . Peptide - mass maps were recorded on a Bruker time - of - flight mass spectrometer equipped with a delay ion - extraction source , nitro - gen 337 nm laser and Scout device for multiprobe operation ( Bruker - Franzen ) . Data were acquired using a Lecroy 9350AM ( 1 Gsamples / sec ) digital storage oscilloscope and were analyzed on a Macintosh Power PC 7100 / 80 ( Apple ) using the LaserOne software package ( P . Mortensen and M . Mann ) . The spectra were obtained as averages of 40 – 100 single laser shots . Resolution was sufficient to assign monoisotopic masses to all peptide peaks and these masses were searched against a comprehensive sequence database ( http : / / www . mann . embl heidelberg . de / Services / PeptideSearch / PeptideSearchIntro . html ) . Tryptic autolysis peaks and matrix - related peaks were used for internal calibration .
