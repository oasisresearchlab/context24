Cloning of the constructs . For preparation of the construct encoding for human wild - type calmodulin - like domain ( CaMD ) of  - actinin - 1 , the following pair of oligonucleotides was used ( introduced restriction sites Xho I and Mlu I are underlined ) : wtCaMD forward : 5 ` - CAGGGCTCGAGCATCAGCCAGGAGCAGATGAATGAGTTC ( Xho I ) wtCaMD reverse : 5 ` - CTCACGCGTGGATTAGAGGTCACTCTC ( Mlu I ) CaMD mutants harbouring alanine substitutions within the predicted calcium - binding motif between amino acids 759 - 770 and 800 - 811 were created by site - specific PCR mutagenesis using the QuikChange II Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . All three mutants ( CaMD _ D759A , CaMD _ E770A and CaMD _ D800A ) were produced using the wild - type CaMD cDNA as template and the following oligonucleotides primers : CaMD _ D759A forward : 5 ` - TCCTTCAACCACTTTGCCCGGGATCACTCCG - 3 ` CaMD _ D759A reverse : 5 ` - CGGAGTGATCCCGGGCAAAGTGGTTGAAGGA - 3 ` CaMD _ E770A forward : 5 ` - CTGGGTCCCGAGGCGTTCAAAGCCTGC - 3 ` CaMD _ E770A reverse : 5 ` - GCAGGCTTTGAACGCCTCGGGACCCAG - 3 ` CaMD _ D800A forward : 5 ` - CATGAGCATTGTGGCCCCCAACCGCCTGG - 3 ` CaMD _ D800A reverse : 5 ` - CCAGGCGGTTGGGGGCCACAATGCTCATG - 3 ` Supplementary Data . Sequence - specific NMR resonance assignment . Sequence - specific assignments of backbone resonances for the apo form were obtained using standard triple resonance NMR experiments ( HNCO , HN ( CO ) CA , HNCA , HN ( CO ) CACB , HNCACB ) . NOE distance restraints were determined with the use of 3D 15 N - edited and 13 C - edited NOESY - HSQC experiments . An almost complete resonance assignment was obtained for each backbone nucleus of the apo form with the exception of Gly ( - 3 ) , Ser ( - 2 ) , and Ser ( - 1 ) from the N - terminal GSS linker , and Thr868 for which the 1 H , 15 N cross peak could not be observed , presumably due to dynamics . The overall completeness of resonance assignments including side chains was 97 . 4 % . 1 H , 15 N , 13 C resonances of the holo form were assigned employing the same set of NMR experiments as for the apo form . Gly ( - 3 ) , Ser ( - 2 ) , Ser ( - 1 ) , Thr868 and Gly869 backbone resonances of the holo form could not be identified in the 15 N - HSQC spectra . The overall completeness of resonance assignments including side chains was 98 . 8 % . Supplementary Information 2 Supplementary Table S1 .

Supplementary Information 3 Supplementary Figures Supplementary Figure S1 . Native ESI - MS : Comparison of deconvoluted mass spectra of wild - type CaMD and its mutants . The charge states + 9 to + 14 were deconvoluted to obtain monoisotopic masses ( [ M + H ] + ) for all major signals . In wild - type and mutant D800A the two most intense signals corresponded very well to the masses of the molecular ion and its adduct with a single Ca 2 + ion . For mutant D759A only a signal matching the molecular ion but no calcium adducts were observed . Minor peaks represent oxidation products ( e . g . at 16 , 978 . 91 ) , salt adducts , or background signals . Theoretical and observed masses of wild - type CaMD and its mutants are represented in the table .
