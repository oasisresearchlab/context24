Even after six 34 decades of study , fundamental details of its predation cycle remain mysterious . Here , we used 35 cryo - electron tomography to comprehensively image the lifecycle of B . bacteriovorus at 36 nanometer - scale resolution . In addition to providing the first high - resolution images of predation 37 in a native ( hydrated , unstained ) state , we also discover several surprising features of the process , 38 including novel macromolecular complexes involved in prey attachment / invasion and a flexible 39 portal structure lining a hole in the prey peptidoglycan that tightly seals the prey outer membrane 40 around the predator during entry . Unexpectedly , we find that B . bacteriovorus does not shed its 41 flagellum during invasion , but rather resorbs it into its periplasm for degradation . Finally , 42 following replication and division in the bdelloplast , we observe a transient and extensive 43 ribosomal lattice on the condensed B . bacteriovorus nucleoid . 44 4 Introduction 45 Predation is a widespread behavior , from the largest eukaryotes to the smallest viruses , that drives 46 evolution and energy flow in biological communities . In bacteria , predatory behavior is common 47 and multiple predation types have been described , including epibiotic strategies in which the 48 predator remains outside the prey and endobiotic strategies in which the predator invades the 49 prey’s cytoplasm or periplasm ( Pérez et al . , 2016 ) . Since its description in 1963 as the first known 50 bacterial parasite of bacteria ( Stolp and Starr , 1963 ) , Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus has been a 51 paradigm of periplasmic endobiotic predation , in which a small predator takes up residence in a 52 larger diderm prey’s periplasm ( Laloux , 2020 ; Sockett , 2009 ) . The ability of Bdellovibrio - and - 53 like - organisms ( BALOs ) to invade other Gram - negative bacteria , including human pathogens , has 54 rendered them potential candidates for living antibiotics to tackle the crisis of antimicrobial 55 resistance that has emerged in the past few decades ( Bratanis et al . , 2020 ; Cavallo et al . , 2021 ; 56 Harini et al . , 2013 ; Iebba et al . , 2014 ; Madhusoodanan , 2019 ; Negus et al . , 2017 ; Pantanella et al . , 57 2018 ; Raghunathan et al . , 2019 ; Russo et al . , 2018 ; Shatzkes et al . , 2017a , 2017b ) , or even as a 58 possible probiotic agent ( Bonfiglio et al . , 2020 ) . For example , it has been shown that treating 59 zebrafish infected with Shigella flexneri with B . bacteriovorus increases the animals’ survival rate 60 ( Willis et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , microbial predation has been suggested to have been involved in 61 pivotal evolutionary events including the genesis of eukaryotic cells , the rise of multicellularity , 62 and pathogenicity ( Davidov and Jurkevitch , 2009 ; Erken et al . , 2013 ; Lyons and Kolter , 2015 ) . 63 64 The predatory lifecycle of B . bacteriovorus has been extensively studied by methods including 65 conventional transmission electron microscopy , light / fluorescence microscopy , helium - ion 66 microscopy , atomic force microscopy and biochemical assays ( Burnham et al . , 1968 ; Kuru et al . , 67 5 2017 ; Makowski et al . , 2020 ; Núñez et al . , 2003 ; Said et al . , 2019 ; Stolp and Starr , 1965 ) , and is 68 the subject of several excellent reviews ( see for example : ( Cavallo et al . , 2021 ; Laloux , 2020 ; 69 Negus et al . , 2017 ; Rotem et al . , 2014 ; Sockett , 2009 ) ) . In the free - living attack phase , the predator 70 is transcriptionally streamlined , with a highly compacted spiral nucleoid ( Butan et al . , 2011 ) , and 71 a vibrioid cell shape caused by the asymmetric activity of a peptidoglycan hydrolase ( Banks et al . , 72 2022 ) . At one pole of the cell , a sheathed unipolar flagellum enables high - velocity ( up to 160 µm / s 73 ( Lambert et al . , 2006 ; Rendulic , 2004 ) ) motile collisions with prey . The flagellar filament has a 74 distinctive damped waveform due to segments made up of subunits with different helical properties 75 ( Thomashow and Rittenberg , 1985a ) . Initial interaction with , and attachment to , prey is mediated 76 by type IVb ( Avidan et al . , 2017 ) and type IVa pili ( T4P ) ( Evans et al . , 2007 ; Mahmoud and Koval , 77 2010 ; Milner et al . , 2014 ) at the pole opposite the flagellum ( the “biting pole” ) . Following this 78 initial interaction , B . bacteriovorus uses flagellum - independent gliding motility to reach an 79 attachment site on the side of rod - shaped prey cells ( Lambert et al . , 2011 ) . 80 81 Upon initial attachment , prey quality is assessed in a cyclic - di - GMP - dependent process ( Caulton 82 and Lovering , 2020 ; Hobley et al . , 2012 ; Meek et al . , 2019 ) , and if the prey is found to be suitable 83 and not already under attack by another predator ( Lerner et al . , 2012 ) , the attachment is made 84 permanent and the process of invasion begins . Initially , it was suggested that a “drilling” 85 mechanism caused by flagellar rotation might play a role in the invasion process ( Burnham et al . , 86 1968 ; Stolp and Starr , 1965 ) , but later studies found that flagellar motility - compromised mutants 87 can still invade prey , which fits with the roles of pili and gliding motility mentioned above 88 ( Lambert et al . , 2006 ) . Another early penetration model hypothesized that entry is passive and 89 6 occurs due to osmotic forces from the flux of solutes and water resulting from structural changes 90 in the prey envelope ( Abram et al . , 1974 ) . 91 92 Prey invasion involves enzymatic modification of the prey cell wall by B . bacteriovorus at the 93 predator - prey contact point ( Kuru et al . , 2017 ; Thomashow and Rittenberg , 1978c , 1978b , 1978a ; 94 Tudor et al . , 1990 ) and is associated with the secretion , by type I and II secretion systems , of many 95 enzymes ( Pasternak et al . , 2014 ; Rendulic , 2004 ) , including glycanases ( Harding et al . , 2020 ; 96 Thomashow and Rittenberg , 1978a ) , peptidases ( Lerner et al . , 2012 ; Tudor et al . , 1990 ) and 97 deacetylases ( Lambert et al . , 2016 ) . A self - protection protein in B . bacteriovorus inhibits the 98 predator’s peptidases , thereby allowing specific modification of the prey cell wall ( Lambert et al . , 99 2015 ) . These modifications round the prey cell and greatly expand the periplasmic space , 100 providing room for the predator to enter . Entry itself is rapid , occurring in a few minutes or less 101 ( Abram et al . , 1974 ; Capeness et al . , 2013 ) . With a few exceptions noted ( Iida et al . , 2009 ; Lambert 102 et al . , 2006 ) , flagella are no longer visible on B . bacteriovorus when they enter their prey ( Shilo , 103 1969 ; Thomashow , L . S . , 1979 ) . 104 105 Once B . bacteriovorus enters the prey’s periplasm , the entry pore is sealed and transpeptidases 106 modify the prey cell wall to render it more robust to osmotic pressure ( Kuru et al . , 2017 ; Lerner et 107 al . , 2012 ) , forming what is known as the bdelloplast ( Starr and Baigent , 1966 ) . If prey - derived 108 cues indicate the availability of sufficient nutrients in the bdelloplast ( Rotem et al . , 2015 ) , B . 109 bacteriovorus enters its growth phase . The predator consumes the cytoplasmic contents of the prey , 110 facilitated by translocation of outer membrane ( OM ) pore proteins into the prey’s cytoplasmic 111 membrane ( Tudor and Karp , 1994 ) and secretion of nucleases to digest the prey’s nucleic acids 112 7 ( Bukowska - Faniband et al . , 2020 ) . This fuels predator growth , through bidirectional elongation , 113 and replication of its genetic material ( Makowski et al . , 2019 ) . Once available nutrients are 114 exhausted , the predator septates synchronously into multiple progeny cells by non - binary fission , 115 with the number of progeny cells depending on the size of the prey ( Fenton et al . , 2010a ; Kaljević 116 et al . , 2021 ) . Finally , the progeny cells , reset to the attack phase , use an enzyme specific for 117 deacetylated peptidoglycan to lyse the prey cell wall ( Harding et al . , 2020 ; Lambert et al . , 2016 ) , 118 creating pores through which they exit the bdelloplast and move on in search of new prey ( Fenton 119 et al . , 2010a ) . If the first invasion does not yield sufficient nutrients for replication and division , a 120 B . bacteriovorus cell may leave the first bdelloplast and complete its lifecycle in a second prey 121 ( Makowski et al . , 2019 ) . 122 123 Despite extensive study , the structural details of much of the invasion process remain unclear . 124 Most of the previous work relied on low - resolution imaging methods or conventional electron 125 microscopy preparations , in which dehydration and fixation disrupt cell membranes and obscure 126 macromolecular details . Cryogenic electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) allows the investigation of 127 cellular processes in a fully - hydrated frozen state with macromolecular resolution ( Ghosal et al . , 128 2019a ; Kaplan et al . , 2021a ; Oikonomou and Jensen , 2017 ) , but so far it has only been applied to 129 study the ultrastructure of individual B . bacteriovorus cells in the attack phase . While these studies 130 revealed important structural features of this stage ( Borgnia et al . , 2008 ; Butan et al . , 2011 ; Fenton 131 et al . , 2010b ) , much remains to be learned about the full invasion cycle of B . bacteriovorus . 132 133 Here , we used cryo - ET to image the predation cycle of B . bacteriovorus invading three types of 134 prey : Vibrio cholerae , Escherichia coli , and E . coli minicells . Our work reveals , for the first time , 135 8 the macromolecular details of each stage of the B . bacteriovorus lifecycle and uncovers several 136 unexpected features of the process , including absorption of the extracellular flagellum into the 137 predator’s periplasm during attachment , a flexible portal structure associated with the prey 138 peptidoglycan surrounding the predator during entry , and formation of a ribosome lattice around 139 the predator’s nucleoid after the prey is consumed in the bdelloplast . 140 141 142 9 Results 143 To visualize the predatory lifecycle of B . bacteriovorus in a near - native state , we applied cryo - ET 144 imaging to samples of B . bacteriovorus HD100 at various timepoints , from 10 minutes to 16 hours , 145 after addition of prey ( Vibrio cholerae , Escherichia coli , or E . coli minicells ) . Compared to thicker 146 cells , the thinness of E . coli minicells yielded higher - resolution details about the predator - prey 147 interaction . The small size of the minicells also prevented complete entry of the predator , allowing 148 us to capture otherwise fleeting intermediates in the rapid invasion process . Table S1 lists the 149 number of cryo - tomograms we acquired at each stage of the predatory lifecycle of B . bacteriovorus , 150 and Table S2 the number of examples we observed of each of the features described below . 151 152 I - Anatomy of the attack - phase B . bacteriovorus cell 153 Our cryo - tomograms of attack - phase B . bacteriovorus showed features previously described , 154 including a compact spiral nucleoid occupying the center of the cell ( Fig . 1A ) ( Borgnia et al . , 2008 ; 155 Butan et al . , 2011 ) . While the nucleoid excluded ribosomes , they were occasionally abundant at 156 its periphery ( Fig . S1 and Movie S1 ) , as seen previously by cryo - ET ( Borgnia et al . , 2008 ; Butan 157 et al . , 2011 ) . Again consistent with previous cryo - ET of attack - phase cells ( Borgnia et al . , 2008 ) , 158 we saw unidentified tubes ( on average , two per cell ) in the cytoplasm . The tubes had a uniform 159 diameter of ~ 8 nm and were typically a few tens of nanometers in length ( Fig . S2 ) . Each cell 160 contained a single polar flagellum , sheathed in outer membrane ( Fig . 1A ) , and subtomogram 161 averaging of 79 particles revealed that the structure of the flagellar motor is similar to that recently 162 published from a host - independent strain of B . bacteriovorus ( Chaban et al . , 2018 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . 163 164 10 We also saw novel features , including extracellular vesicles with a uniform diameter of ~ 25 nm 165 near cells ( Fig . S3A ) . On the “biting” pole opposite the flagellum , we noted several characteristic 166 features that have not been described before . Rarely , we saw spherical and short filamentous 167 structures in the periplasm ( Figs . 1A and S3B ) . We observed abundant , thin ( ~ 3 - 4 nm wide ) 168 fimbriae on the cell surface , with lengths ranging from ~ 50 to more than 100 nm ( Fig . S3A & C ) . 169 We also observed a novel complex , spanning the periplasm and with a prominent extracellular 170 rosette of density . We call this unidentified structure the “rose - like complex . ” On average , each 171 cell had 2 - 3 rose - like complexes at the biting pole ( Fig . 1A ) . Subtomogram averaging of 132 172 particles revealed a molecular complex spanning the entire periplasmic space with associated 173 cytoplasmic densities ( a ring ~ 17 nm in diameter ) and extensive extracellular densities . Five 174 distinct extracellular densities could be distinguished in cross - section : two stacked rings and a 175 central cap ( Fig . 1C ) . 176 177 We observed both piliated and non - piliated T4aP basal bodies on the biting pole ( Figs . 1A and S4 178 and S5 ) , with empty more abundant than piliated ( Table S2 ) . A subtomogram average of 335 non - 179 piliated T4aP basal bodies revealed the architecture , including a distinctive extracellular ring 180 present in both non - piliated and piliated basal bodies ( Figs . 1D and S4 ) which was not seen in 181 subtomogram averages of T4P in other species ( Chang et al . , 2016 , 2017 ; Gold et al . , 2015 ; 182 Treuner - Lange et al . , 2020 ) . While all piliated basal bodies had the ring , not all non - piliated basal 183 bodies did ( Fig . S5 ) . This could either be because the external ring had disassembled or not yet 184 assembled , or because these structures were not in fact T4aP but rather , e . g . T4bP , which are also 185 involved in adhesion to prey ( Avidan et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , classifying the non - piliated T4aP 186 using principal component analysis revealed that ~ 1 / 2 of the particles had only the Secretin outer 187 11 membrane channel and extracellular ring and lacked the lower periplasmic ring ( Fig . S6 ) . This 188 might reflect different assembly stages , as it has been shown that T4P in other species utilize an 189 outside - in assembly pathway starting from the Secretin ( Friedrich et al . , 2014 ) . 190 191 II - Attachment of B . bacteriovorus to prey 192 We observed attachment of B . bacteriovorus to V . cholerae and E . coli minicells ( of various sizes ) . 193 The earliest event we identified was connection of B . bacteriovorus to prey by T4aP , with the tip 194 of the extended pilus clearly in contact with the prey’s outer membrane . At the resolution of our 195 cryo - tomograms , no distinctive features were visible at the pilus - prey attachment point ( Fig . 2A ) . 196 Occasionally , we also saw thin fimbriae apparently contacting the outer membrane of the prey cell 197 ( Fig . S7 ) . 198 199 Next , we observed predator and prey in close apposition . In some cases , pilus attachments were 200 still visible ; in others the pili had retracted completely . In all cases , we observed non - piliated T4aP 201 basal bodies aligned at the contact site , with rose - like complexes nearby ( Figs . 2B and S8 ) . In 202 several attachments to E . coli minicells , where finer detail could be resolved , we observed that the 203 non - piliated T4aP basal bodies extended through the prey outer membrane , with their extracellular 204 rings apparently embedded in the prey peptidoglycan ( PG ) ( Figs . 2B and S9 ) . At this stage , we 205 began to observe enlargement of the prey periplasm . In agreement with previous studies ( Lambert 206 et al . , 2011 ) , with rod - shaped prey the contact site was usually located on the side of the prey cell , 207 and on the pole of the predator ( Fig . S10A ) . In some cases , particularly with smaller , spherical E . 208 coli minicells , the attachment site was displaced slightly off the biting pole onto the side of the 209 predator ( Fig . S10B - D ) . 210 12 211 In the next stage , we observed an electron - dense but relatively unstructured plaque of material 212 ( henceforth referred to as the “attachment plaque” ) at the contact point between the predator and 213 the prey . The diameter of this plaque ranged from 15 - 70 nm and the thickness usually extended 214 from the predator’s OM to the prey’s PG cell wall ( Figs . 2C , S10C and D ) , suggesting a 215 modification of the prey cell wall at the predator - prey contact point in agreement with previous 216 reports ( Kuru et al . , 2017 ) . We often observed nonpiliated T4aP basal bodies near or in the plaque 217 ( Fig . S10D ) , as well as rose - like complexes and , very occasionally , prey - attached pili nearby . 218 While we sometimes observed two or even three B . bacteriovorus attached to the same prey cell 219 with T4aP , only one ever formed an attachment plaque , consistent with the committed attachment 220 observed in previous studies ( Fig . S11 ) . 221 222 At around the same time that the attachment plaque formed at the biting pole , an unexpected 223 process began at the other pole . The sheathed flagellum of the B . bacteriovorus was resorbed into 224 the periplasmic space , wrapping around the cell . The process seems to initiate with breakage of 225 the flagellar motor at its OM - embedded ring ( the L - ( lipopolysaccharide ) ring , Fig . S12 ) . The L - 226 ring remained in the OM . Early in the process , the P - ( peptidoglycan ) ring was still visible around 227 the flagellar rod but was located more than 20 nm from the OM , compared to 10 - 11 nm in attack - 228 phase cells ( Figs . S13 and S14 and Movie S2 ) . Consistent with a decoupling of the P - and L - rings , 229 we observed two examples of B . bacteriovorus cells attached to prey with a plaque and with 230 disrupted OM around the flagellum ; in both cases , only the P - ring , and not the L - ring , was visible 231 surrounding the rod of the motor ( Fig . S15 ) . 232 233 13 As flagellar resorption continued , the motor ( lacking the L - ring but including the P - ring and rod ) 234 was completely internalized to the periplasm and moved off the cell pole , with the hook and basal 235 portion of the filament entering the periplasm ( Figs . 3 , S16 and Movie S3 ) . The L - ring still 236 encircled the filament at the junction of OM and flagellar sheath ( Figs . 3 , S16 and Movie S3 ) . 237 Eventually , most or all of the filament was internalized to the periplasm , wrapping around the cell 238 ( Figs . S17 , S18 and Movies S4 - S7 ) . In some cases , we saw the motor further up the side of the 239 cell . In other cases , we could not find the motor , either because it was degraded or because it was 240 located in a part of the cell not visible due to the effect of the missing wedge of information in 241 cryo - ET ( Baumeister , 1999 ) . During the absorption process , the exit point of the flagellum 242 sometimes shifted from the pole up the side of the cell ( Figs . S18 , S19 and Movie S6 ) . In cells 243 with fully internalized filaments , we could no longer identify L - rings in the outer membrane . In 244 some cases , the wrapped filament broke in the periplasm ( Movie S4 ) . Figure S20 summarizes this 245 absorption process based on our cryo - ET data . 246 247 Chemosensory arrays remained visible throughout the attachment phase , although they appeared 248 to be partially degraded ( smaller in diameter than in attack - phase cells ) in some cases . As in attack - 249 phase cells , we observed small , uniformly - sized membrane vesicles in the vicinity of the predator 250 and attached prey ( Fig . S21 ) . In some vesicles , densities were visible either inside and / or on the 251 surface ( Fig . S21F ) . We also saw vesicles near the sheath of the flagellum during resorption ( Fig . 252 S22 ) . 253 254 III - Invasion of the prey periplasm 255 14 We captured 18 cryo - tomograms of stalled invasions of B . bacteriovorus entering the periplasm 256 of E . coli minicells . Note that in these stalled invasions we do not know how long before sample 257 freezing a particular predator entered its prey or whether the non - permissive size of the small prey 258 had incidental effects on the entry process . Still , this paradigm provided an unique opportunity to 259 view fleeting stages of invasion at high resolution . In invasion , the attachment plaque at the contact 260 site was replaced by a portal structure through which the predator entered the prey periplasm ( Figs . 261 4 , S23 , and Movie S8 ) . This portal ring , which bridged the outer membranes of predator and prey , 262 appeared in cross - section as a thin ( < 5 nm ) , dark density extending from the prey’s PG layer to the 263 outside of the cell , capping the open end of the prey outer membrane ( Figs . 4A and S23A ) . The 264 height of the portal in cross - section , on the order of a few tens of nanometers , varied between cells , 265 and even on opposite sides of the same cell ( e . g . compare Figs . 4A and S23A ) . In eight examples , 266 we observed what appeared to be prey OM blebbing out from the portal ( Movie S9 ) . Consistent 267 with a water - tight seal model , the portal appeared to exert considerable force on the B . 268 bacteriovorus cell , as previously observed ( Abram et al . , 1974 ) , reducing the distance between the 269 outer and inner membranes by ~ 50 % at the entry point compared to elsewhere in the cell , and 270 constricting the deformation - resistant cell wall ( Figs . 4B - C , S23B - C ) . Consistent with previous 271 reports of cell flexibility ( Borgnia et al . , 2008 ) , we observed that B . bacteriovorus could bend 272 considerably to maximally occupy the prey periplasm ( Fig . 4A ) . 273 274 In all stalled invasions , we observed that the B . bacteriovorus cells had fully degraded their 275 absorbed periplasmic flagella and lacked rose - like complexes and fimbriae . Chemosensory arrays 276 were also partially or completely degraded ( Fig . S24 ) . Interestingly , while complexes 277 morphologically similar to non - piliated T4aP basal bodies were still present in the predator , they 278 15 lacked the characteristic extracellular ring found at earlier stages of invasion ( Fig . S25 ) , and were 279 less abundant than T4aP basal bodies in attack - phase cells . This could be because either the 280 extracellular ring is lost during the invasion process , or these are different complexes , e . g . type II 281 secretion systems . 282 283 In two examples where a non - flagellated B . bacteriovorus cell was in the vicinity of a lysed prey , 284 we observed knob - like densities on the predator’s biting pole ( Fig . S26 ) . Given the lysed prey cell 285 nearby and the lack of attack - phase structures such as flagella or chemosensory arrays in the B . 286 bacteriovorus , we think it likely that these cells were pulled out of the prey post - invasion during 287 sample preparation . When present , the knob - like structures could be abundant ; we identified 23 288 examples on one cell ( Table S2 ) . While leg - like densities could be seen extending from the 289 extracellular domains to the PG layer in individual examples , subtomogram averaging failed to 290 resolve a consistent structure , suggesting flexibility or differing stoichiometry . 291 292 Even though entry was incomplete , B . bacteriovorus in stalled invasions of E . coli minicells 293 showed signs of entering growth phase . Some predators had at least partially decondensed their 294 nucleoids , and the prey cytoplasm was considerably reduced in size , presumably consumed by the 295 predator . Perhaps related to this digestion , we observed multiple vesicles with a consistent size of 296 ~ 25 nm in the prey periplasm ( Figs . 4A and S23A ) . We cannot tell whether they originated from 297 prey or predator membrane , but their size is identical to those we observed in the vicinity of 298 isolated attack - phase and prey - attached B . bacteriovorus . 299 300 IV - Growth phase in the bdelloplast 301 16 We captured 54 cryo - tomograms of the bdelloplast stage from samples of B . bacteriovorus 302 invading V . cholerae cells and E . coli minicells large enough to accommodate the entire predator . 303 Once the predator fully entered the prey’s periplasm , the entry hole was sealed by a scar consisting 304 of an extracellular bubble of what appeared to be membrane and an amorphous electron density 305 associated with the prey OM and PG beneath it ( Figs . 5 , S27 and S28 and Movies S10 - S13 ) . In 306 invaded V . cholerae , the prey’s ( non - functional ) flagellum remained attached to the bdelloplast 307 ( Figs . 5F and S27B , C ) . The flagellum remained connected to the part of the motor embedded in 308 the OM and PG : the PL - rings and part of the rod . Presumably these parts were separated from the 309 rest of the motor by periplasmic expansion . We did not observe any motor components still 310 associated with the inner membrane . The fact that flagellar relics remained only on V . cholerae 311 bdelloplasts , and not E . coli , could be because the flagellar sheath aids in retention . In V . cholerae 312 bdelloplasts , we sometimes also observed PL - subcomplexes ( without associated filaments ) 313 resulting from previous flagellar loss events ( Ferreira et al . , 2019 ; Kaplan et al . , 2020 ) ( Fig . S27B ) . 314 315 In predators inside bdelloplasts , we saw neither chemosensory arrays nor any relics of flagella , 316 although we occasionally observed filamentous structures in the periplasm that may be remnants 317 of flagellar digestion ( Fig . S29 ) . We also sometimes observed these in ( flagellated ) attack - phase 318 cells ( Fig . S3B ) . Interestingly , they were always located at the pole ( the biting pole of attack - phase 319 cells ) , perhaps reflecting spatial differences in proteolysis . We also could not find any rose - like 320 complexes or T4aP basal bodies with external rings in B . bacteriovorus inside bdelloplasts . As in 321 stalled invasions , we did identify putative nonpiliated T4aP basal bodies lacking the external ring . 322 Again , they were less abundant than in attack - phase cells ; from 47 cryo - tomograms of stalled 323 invasions or early bdelloplasts , we identified 25 such particles ( Table S2 ) . We did occasionally 324 17 observe 8 - nm - wide cytoplasmic tubes , as seen in other lifecycle stages ( Figs . S30 ) . In addition , we 325 saw variously - sized spherical , nested and horseshoe - shaped vesicles in the predator’s cytoplasm , 326 morphologically similar to those reported in other species ( Dobro et al . , 2017 ) ( Fig . S31 ) . 327 328 As in stalled invasions of E . coli minicells , we observed many uniformly - sized ( ~ 25 nm ) vesicles 329 in the bdelloplast periplasm ( Figs . 5 and S31 and Movies S11 - S13 ) . Consistent with active growth , 330 B . bacteriovorus nucleoids were less condensed than in earlier stages and , in concert with the prey 331 cytoplasm shrinking , the predator cell elongated and curled to fill most of the bdelloplast ( Fig . 332 S32 ) . Contrary to previous observations by traditional EM ( Abram et al . , 1974 ) , we could not 333 unambiguously identify a connection between the predator OM and prey inner membrane ( Figs . 334 S28 , S32 , S33 and Movies S10 - S11 ) . 335 336 When nearly all of the prey cytoplasm was consumed , the elongated B . bacteriovorus cell divided . 337 The number of progeny depends on the size of the bdelloplast ( Fenton et al . , 2010a ) , and we 338 observed two or three progeny cells in E . coli and V . cholerae prey ( e . g . , Fig . 5 ) . In a few cases , 339 division produced an extra , small spherical product , in accordance with previous reports ( Burnham 340 et al . , 1970 ) ( Fig . S34 ) . In some cases , bdelloplasts contained a very dense sphere of material , 341 presumably containing the remnants of the prey cytoplasm ( Figs . 5 and S34 ) . In other cases , not 342 even this remained ( a characteristic we use to define an “end - stage bdelloplast” ) . The characteristic 343 ~ 25 nm vesicles , however , were still present in end - stage bdelloplasts even after no prey cytoplasm 344 remained . 345 346 18 In some elongated or divided B . bacteriovorus in end - stage bdelloplasts of E . coli , we observed a 347 remarkable hexagonal lattice of ribosomes coating the nucleoid ( Fig . 6 and Movies S13 - S17 ) . The 348 lattice spacing was ~ 20 nm , consistent with maximally dense packing of ribosomes ( Fig . S35 ) . 349 This arrangement was much more extensive than we and others observed in attack - phase cells 350 ( Butan et al . , 2011 ) . We measured the distances from ribosomes to the apparent surface of the 351 nucleoid in two tomograms . Of 2 , 304 ribosomes in one ( Fig . 6 ) and 1 , 109 in the other ( Fig . S36 ) , 352 ~ 80 % were located within 10 nm of the nucleoid surface . By comparison , in a simulation of the 353 same number of randomly - packed 20 - nm spheres in the same tomographic volumes ( see Materials 354 and Methods ) , only ~ 20 - 25 % were expected to be located within 10 nm of the nucleoid surface 355 ( Figs . 6E and S36 ) , suggesting that the association we observed does not arise simply by chance . 356 To investigate whether the ordered ribosomes shared the same orientation , we produced an ~ 4 . 7 357 nm - resolution subtomogram average of the ribosomes in a B . bacteriovorus cell and mapped it 358 back into the tomographic volume using the positions and orientations determined during 359 averaging . We found that individual particles were apparently randomly oriented on the nucleoid 360 surface ( Fig . S37 ) . 361 362 Movie S18 offers an animated summary of all stages of the B . bacteriovorus predatory lifecycle 363 that we observed in this study . 364 19 Discussion 365 Here we used cryo - ET imaging to reveal the predation cycle of B . bacteriovorus in situ at 366 nanometer - scale resolution ( Movie S18 ) . Our results contextualize decades of research on BALO 367 predation and uncover many surprising new details of the process . 368 369 In addition to previously - characterized structures in attack - phase cells such as the flagellum , poly - 370 phosphate storage granules , highly - condensed nucleoid , chemosensory array , and type IV pili 371 ( Borgnia et al . , 2008 ; Butan et al . , 2011 ; Chaban et al . , 2018 ; Evans et al . , 2007 ; Mahmoud and 372 Koval , 2010 ) , we observed several unidentified structures . At all stages of invasion , B . 373 bacteriovorus cells contained 8 nm - wide cytoplasmic tubes , typically two per cell . The identity 374 and function of these tubes , which were also seen previously by cryo - ET in attack - phase cells 375 ( Borgnia et al . , 2008 ) , remains unknown , but they may serve a cytoskeletal role . In a few attack - 376 phase cells , we observed spherical or tubular structures in the periplasm at the biting pole which 377 might be fragments of digested flagella . The biting pole of attack - phase cells also contained 378 abundant fimbriae , shorter ( ~ 100 nm or less ) and thinner than T4aP and without obvious 379 machinery at their base . Their location suggests a role in prey interaction . Interestingly , mutant 380 strains of B . bacteriovorus lacking either T4aP and T4bP genes can still attach to prey ( Avidan et 381 al . , 2017 ; Milner et al . , 2014 ) ; perhaps these fimbriae mediate such adhesion . 382 383 The most intriguing new structure we observed is what we call the rose - like complex , present in 384 ~ 2 - 3 copies on the biting pole of nearly every attack - phase cell we imaged . The periplasmic portion 385 of the rose - like complex is morphologically similar to a recent structure of a tripartite efflux pump 386 ( Alav et al . , 2021 ) and since related B . bacteriovorus type I secretion systems ( T1SS ) secrete 387 20 enzymes that modify the prey during invasion ( Rendulic , 2004 ) , it is possible that the rose - like 388 complex is a T1SS . Consistent with a role in early invasion , we observed rose - like complexes on 389 attack - phase cells and at prey contact sites , but not in cells during or after invasion . The function 390 of the elaborate extracellular domains extending nearly 20 nm out from the cell is of particular 391 interest ; perhaps they interact with , or breach , the prey envelope . 392 393 Another machine with a notable extracellular domain is the T4aP basal body . The pili observed on 394 the biting pole of B . bacteriovorus in early micrographs ( Abram and Davis , 1970 ; Abram et al . , 395 1974 ; Shilo , 1969 ) were previously identified as T4aP by mutant analysis and immunolocalization 396 ( Evans et al . , 2007 ; Mahmoud and Koval , 2010 ) . Our higher - resolution imaging here revealed a 397 novel extracellular ring surrounding the base of the pilus , not seen in previous subtomogram 398 averages of related T4aP in Thermus thermophilus and Myxococcus xanthus ( Chang et al . , 2016 ; 399 Gold et al . , 2015 ) . The ring was also present in non - piliated basal bodies , indicating that it is stable 400 in the absence of the pilus . Interestingly , these extracellular densities were observed on attack - 401 phase cells in a previous cryo - ET study , but their relation to T4aP was not resolved ( Borgnia et al . , 402 2008 ) . We observed some non - piliated complexes lacking the extracellular ring , both in attack - 403 phase cells and in bdelloplasts , where no complexes with the outer ring were observed . It is 404 possible that these complexes are not T4aP , but rather a related machine containing a Secretin pore 405 in the outer membrane , such as a type II secretion system , which is structurally similar ( Ghosal et 406 al . , 2019b ) and thought to be involved in B . bacteriovorus secretion ( Dori - Bachash et al . , 2008 ; 407 Rendulic , 2004 ) . In addition , B . bacteriovorus also contains a large repertoire of T4bP genes , 408 which are dispensable for attachment but required for invasion ( Avidan et al . , 2017 ; Schwudke et 409 al . , 2005 ) . Their products have not been located on the cell and it is possible that some or all of the 410 21 ring - less basal bodies we saw were T4bP . Alternatively , the extracellular ring may be a transient 411 component of the B . bacteriovorus T4aP , perhaps dissociating during the prey entry process . 412 413 The pilin protein PilA is required for invasion and T4aP have been suggested to pull cells into prey , 414 perhaps by attaching to the cell wall ( Evans et al . , 2007 ; Mahmoud and Koval , 2010 ; Milner et al . , 415 2014 ) , but mutants lacking the disassembly PilT ATPase are still capable of invasion ( Chanyi and 416 Koval , 2014 ) and the role of T4aP in the process remains a major open question in the field 417 ( Sockett , 2009 ) . In our tomograms , multiple T4aP can be seen attached to prey cells and clearly 418 exerting force as they retracted , pulling the prey OM and PG into close contact with the predator . 419 As the membranes were brought into contact , the shortening pili fully disassembled , leaving empty 420 basal bodies . Interestingly , these non - piliated basal bodies continued to mediate attachment and 421 could be seen extending through the prey OM , with their extracellular rings located in the PG layer 422 of the prey , suggesting the function of this novel component . Our results thus suggest that pili 423 themselves do not drive entry , but rather force the initial connection . If the basal bodies without 424 external rings we observed in bdelloplasts were in fact T4aP , it is possible that the rings remained 425 embedded in the prey PG . 426 427 With a few exceptions noted by ( Lambert et al . , 2006 ) , B . bacteriovorus are known to lose their 428 flagella when entering prey . Our images reveal a surprising mechanism : while attached to a prey 429 cell , the flagellar motor is broken at the L - ring and the filament absorbed into the predator’s 430 periplasm , where it is digested . This mechanism differs from all previous observations of flagellar 431 loss due to lifecycle - programmed ejection , response to nutrient deprivation or mechanical 432 breakage , all of which leave a stable subcomplex of the P - and L - rings in the cell wall and outer 433 22 membrane ( Ferreira et al . , 2019 ; Kaplan et al . , 2019 , 2020 , 2021b , 2021b ; Zhu and Gao , 2020 ; 434 Zhu et al . , 2019 ; Zhuang and Lo , 2020 ; Zhuang et al . , 2020 ) . It will be interesting to see whether 435 the B . bacteriovorus motor lacks the inter - subunit interactions that likely stabilize the PL - 436 subcomplex in other species ( Johnson et al . , 2021 ; Tan et al . , 2021 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2020 ) . This 437 process also differs from the breakage of the prey flagellum that occurs as the periplasmic space 438 is expanded into the bdelloplast . In that case , we see that the flagellum remains anchored to the 439 cell by a stub of the motor embedded in the outer membrane . Why the hook / filament is not lost is 440 unclear ; perhaps it is locked into the remodeled PG . This process is reminiscent of that recently 441 observed in other species upon cell lysis , where the cytoplasmic flagellar switch complex is lost , 442 while the periplasmic and extracellular components remain ( Kaplan et al . , 2021c ) . 443 444 How does B . bacteriovorus absorb its flagellum into the periplasm ? It is unlikely to be pulled from 445 the motor , which we occasionally saw drift partway up the side of the cell before being fully 446 degraded . Our observation of filaments partially absorbed up to a junction on the side of the cell 447 suggests that the process involves zippering of the flagellar sheath and the outer membrane . 448 Perhaps this is related to the unique lipid composition of the sheath , which is predicted to be even 449 more fluid than the rest of the outer membrane ( Thomashow and Rittenberg , 1985b ) . The vesicles 450 we observed in the vicinity of some absorbed flagella are consistent with previous reports that 451 rotation of sheathed flagella can lead to shedding of outer membrane vesicles ( Aschtgen et al . , 452 2016 ; Brennan et al . , 2014 ) . However , we do not know whether the vesicles formed because the 453 motor was still rotating during absorption or due to the absorption process itself . 454 455 23 Other bacterial species have been observed to wrap their extracellular ( unsheathed ) flagella around 456 themselves ( Alirezaeizanjani et al . , 2020 ; Cohen et al . , 2020 ; Constantino et al . , 2018 ; Hintsche et 457 al . , 2017 ; Kühn et al . , 2017 ; Tian et al . , 2022 ) . This behavior , which Shewanella putrefaciens uses 458 to burrow back out of a tight spot when stuck , is triggered by a mechanical instability in the 459 flagellum that buckles it when the cell can no longer move to alleviate the torque of flagellar 460 rotation ( Kühn et al . , 2017 ) . Such a situation likely occurs when a B . bacteriovorus cell attaches 461 to a prey . Brief continuing flagellar rotation could conceivably wrap the filament around the cell , 462 where fusion of the outer membrane and sheath would bring it into the periplasm . Such increased 463 resistance is consistent with the lateral shift of the biting pole we sometimes observed on attached 464 B . bacteriovorus cells . Interestingly , it was recently shown that a discontinuous flagellar filament 465 formed by two different flagellins facilitates screw - like motility in S . putrefaciens ( Kühn et al . , 466 2018 ) , and is key to wrapping in Campylobacter jejuni ( Cohen et al . , 2020 ) . Multiple flagellins 467 similarly make up distinct segments of the B . bacteriovorus flagellum ( Thomashow and Rittenberg , 468 1985a ) ; the reason for this was unknown but now we speculate that it may facilitate flagellar 469 recycling . 470 471 A major open question is the nature of the pore through which B . bacteriovorus enter their prey . 472 Secreted PG - remodeling enzymes , presumably part of the dense plaque we observe at the 473 attachment site that extends to the prey cell wall , are known to create , and subsequently seal , a 474 reinforced circular porthole in the prey PG ( see figures 2 and 3 in ( Kuru et al . , 2017 ) ) . How the 475 prey outer membrane is modified remains more of a mystery . Prey cells remain intact and 476 transcriptionally active throughout the initial entry process ( Lambert et al . , 2010a ) , so it was 477 proposed that the membranes of prey and predator must fuse ( Negus et al . , 2017 ) . Instead , we 478 24 observed what seems to be a proteinaceous collar curving out from the prey PG to seal the hole in 479 the outer membrane and prevent interaction of the two membranes . Presumably this structure is 480 associated with the PG remodeling enzymes , and may even be a modified and reinforced extension 481 of the cell wall , as suggested by ( Abram et al . , 1974 ) . The portal is dynamic , expanding and 482 contracting to match the cross - section of the cell passing through it , and its height varied between 483 cells ( and even on opposite sides of the same cell ) . As was also seen by traditional thin - section 484 TEM ( Abram et al . , 1974 ) , the portal exerted considerable force on the B . bacteriovorus cell , 485 deforming its PG layer , consistent with a water - tight seal between the cells . 486 487 What provides the force for entry remains enigmatic . Over several decades , various models have 488 been proposed , including flagellar rotation ( Stolp and Starr , 1963 ) , retraction of T4aP attached to 489 the prey cell wall ( Evans et al . , 2007 ; Mahmoud and Koval , 2010 ) , and attachment to the prey 490 inner membrane as osmotic pressure rapidly expands the periplasm ( Abram et al . , 1974 ) . Our 491 results rule out all of these models . We see that the B . bacteriovorus flagellum is broken , and at 492 least partially absorbed , prior to entry . Similarly , pili are fully disassembled prior to entry . And 493 finally , we see prey periplasmic expansion even before entry , presumably due to secreted enzymes 494 that de - crosslink and sculpt the prey PG during entry ( Lerner et al . , 2012 ) , with no visible 495 connection between the predator and the now - distant prey inner membrane . It is possible that an 496 expanding periplasmic space provides a suction force . It is also possible that an active mechanism 497 walks the connection point with the portal down the B . bacteriovorus cell . 498 499 Following predator entry , we saw that the portal is sealed by a scar of electron dense material , 500 likely related to the resealing of the PG sacculus ( Kuru et al . , 2017 ; Snellen and Starr , 1974 ) , with 501 25 a protruding bubble of what appears to be membrane . While previous , traditional EM imaging also 502 observed an electron - dense ring at the sealed penetration pore ( Shilo , 1969 ) , no associated bubble 503 was observed , perhaps reflecting the improved preservation and hydration of membrane structures 504 by cryo - EM . Given the blebs around the invasion portal we noticed on some prey cells in stalled 505 invasions , it may be prey OM . Alternatively , it may be outer membrane pinched off from the end 506 of the invading predator . B . bacteriovorus has a highly labile OM , as we saw both with absorption 507 of the sheathed flagellum and in occasional highly - curved cells where the outer membrane fused 508 into a sac , and consistent with previous lipid analysis of its unique membrane ( Lambert et al . , 509 2008 ) . In either case , the bubble must be somehow tethered to the seal , perhaps through membrane - 510 embedded protein complexes . 511 512 While we did not see the connections to the prey cytoplasm during entry observed by ( Abram et 513 al . , 1974 ) , we did see a few examples of the predator outer and prey inner membranes in close 514 proximity in the bdelloplast . In most cases , however , we only observed vesicles in the bdelloplast 515 periplasm , suggesting that this may be a mechanism for nutrient transfer . Compared to membrane 516 vesicles of other species ( Kaplan et al . , 2021d ; Toyofuku et al . , 2019 ) , these vesicles were notable 517 for their relatively small and uniform size ( ~ 25 nm in diameter ) . Similar small periplasmic vesicles 518 may be present in previous traditional EM images , but interpretation is limited by the membrane 519 disruption of that sample preparation ( Abram et al . , 1974 ) . In our tomograms , we cannot tell which 520 cell ( s ) are producing the vesicles in bdelloplasts , but we also observed them near isolated attack - 521 phase cells as well as budding from B . bacteriovorus attached to prey . We also observed them in 522 end - stage bdelloplasts where no remaining prey inner membrane was visible . B . bacteriovorus is 523 known to translocate a pore protein from its outer membrane to the prey inner membrane ( Tudor 524 26 and Karp , 1994 ) ; perhaps similar transferred machinery produces vesicles to deliver prey 525 cytoplasmic content , and lipids , to the growing predator . 526 527 Following complete consumption of the prey , we observed a striking hexagonal lattice of 528 ribosomes on the surface of the B . bacteriovorus condensed nucleoid ( s ) . Similar , though more 529 limited , ribosome associations were previously observed in attack phase , particularly in a B . 530 bacteriovorus mutant with an even more tightly condensed nucleoid than wild - type cells ( Borgnia 531 et al . , 2008 ; Butan et al . , 2011 ) , and in some attack - phase cells in this study . One possibility for 532 this ribosome lattice is that it is a depletion effect resulting from entropic forces encouraging large 533 objects to aggregate on a surface ( Asakura and Oosawa , 1954 , 1958 ; Rocha et al . , 2020 ) . However , 534 we did not observe the effect on other cell surfaces such as the inner membrane , nor in other stages 535 of the cell cycle , so we think this unlikely . Eukaryotic ribosomes have been observed to crystallize 536 in hypothermic conditions ( Byers , 1967 ) , but we see no relationship between the orientation of 537 neighboring particles consistent with a crystal , or with a polysome ( Brandt et al . , 2009 ) . We think 538 a more likely possibility is that the ribosomes are independently translating transcripts from the 539 condensing nucleoid . The switch from growth phase to attack phase involves a transcriptional shift 540 activating a few hundred genes , and inactivating many more ( Karunker et al . , 2013 ; Lambert et al . , 541 2010b ) . The highly condensed attack - phase nucleoid excludes even small monomeric proteins 542 ( Kaljević et al . , 2021 ) , so the ribosomes we observe on the surface may be , or recently have been , 543 coupled to transcribing polymerases . 544 545 Together , our results provide the most complete view to date of the unique structures that enable 546 the complex lifecycle of this endobiotic bacterial predator , and raise new questions . We hope our 547 27 work spurs further study of this fascinating process and informs potential future applications of 548 bacterial predators as living antibiotics ( Atterbury and Tyson , 2021 ) . 549 28 References 550 Abram , D . , and Davis , B .
