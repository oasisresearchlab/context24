This study extends an earlier study developed by Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra ( J Res Sci Teach 48 : 901 – 918 , 2011 ) by providing a more comprehensive test of the CRKM . The variables included in the model tested in this study included emotions : boredom , enjoy - ment and anxiety ; approach goals , need for cognition , motivation , deep cognitive engagement , course grade , and conceptual change . Results of a path analysis conducted on 117 introductory - level college physics students indicated that enjoyment was linked to students’ motivation , deep cognitive engagement , course grade , and conceptual change . Motivational variables were linked to cognitive engagement , course grade , and conceptual change . Finally , students’ course grade was linked to their conceptual change . Need for cognition , boredom , and anxiety played no role in the model . An alternative , revised model was presented excluding these three variables . Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed .

These misconceptions tend to persist even after physics instruction ( Christensen et al . 2009 ; Reiner et al . 2000 ) . Conceptual change , which involves overcoming misconceptions , is the restructuring of an individual’s conceptions so that they are consistent with widely accepted scientiﬁc viewpoints ( Chi and Roscoe 2002 ; Vosniadou 2007 ) . The research on conceptual change has moved past looking exclusively at cognitive variables that impact conceptual change and has more recently considered the impact of motivational and affective variables on conceptual change ( e . g . , Cordova et al . 2014 ; Broughton et al . 2013 ; Gregoire 2013 ) . For example , Dole and Sinatra’s ( 1998 ) cognitive reconstruction of knowledge model ( CRKM ) of conceptual change describes how learner characteristics ( both cognitive and motivational ) interact to support or hinder conceptual change . In the CRKM , motivation is considered to be crucial in impacting conceptual change because without the necessary motivation to learn , a student will be unlikely to engage with the material to resolve discrepancies between their knowledge and the correct conceptions ( Sinatra and Pintrich 2003 ) . Although the theoretical CRKM describes various learner characteristics that may play a role in impacting conceptual change and how they likely interact ( Dole and Sinatra 1998 ) , there is a lack of empirical research testing how the learner characteristics described in the model actually interact or work together to inﬂuence conceptual change . Several studies test individual components of the CRKM such as plausibility ( Lombardi et al . 2013 ) , personal relevance ( Heddy and Sinatra 2013 ) , and motivation ( Johnson and Sinatra 2013 ) . However , only one study has tested , using structural equation modeling , how some of the variables described in the CRKM , including motivation , goal orientation , need for cognition , and course grades act together to impact conceptual change in physics ( Taa - soobshirazi and Sinatra 2011 ) . The goal of the present study was to extend the ﬁndings of Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra ( 2011 ) and provide a more comprehensive test of Dole and Sinatra’s ( 1998 ) CRKM model by examining several CRKM components’ joint effects on conceptual change in physics . The CRKM was used as a framework for studying conceptual change in physics because it includes both motivational and cognitive components of conceptual change and explicitly describes how these variables may predict learners’ conceptual change . Speciﬁcally , the CRKM describes how characteristics of the learner’s background knowledge , motivations , and characteristics of the content students are learning interact to produce a degree of engagement with the new conception and a likelihood of conceptual change . We are particularly interesting in exploring the learner characteristics that may work together to inﬂuence conceptual change . Dole and Sinatra ( 1998 ) argue that learner characteristics include the strength , coherence , and commitment of the learners’ existing conception ; motivational variables ; dissatisfaction ; personal relevance ; social context ; and need for cognition . They further posited that these characteristics interact to impact engagement , which in turn predicts conceptual change . A more detailed explanation of the CRKM is presented in Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra 2011 . For the present study , structural equation modeling was used to test the relationship among many of the individual dif - ference variables described in the CRKM , in addition to other variables that have proven to be predictive of conceptual change ( e . g . emotion ; Heddy and Sinatra 2013 ) . A review of the research on the variables included in the model is presented below . 126 G . Taasoobshirazi et al . 123 Motivation Motivation is a multidimensional construct that interacts with cognition to impact learning and conceptual change , and is a critical variable for conceptual change as described in the CRKM ( Pintrich and Schunk 2002 ; Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra 2011 ) . Research indicates that important components that should be taken into account when examining students’ overall motivation to learn science include intrinsic motivation , extrinsic motivation , self - determination , task relevancy , and self - efﬁcacy ( e . g . , Duncan and McKeachie 2005 ; Glynn et al . 2007 ; Pintrich and Schunk 2002 ) . Intrinsic motivation is a critical component of motivation research ( Wigﬁeld et al . 2008 ) , and is the motivation to engage in a task because one enjoys or is interested in the task . Extrinsic motivation , in contrast , is the motivation to engage in a task because of the expected outcome , such as earning a high grade ( Abuhamdeh and Csikszentmihalyi 2009 ; Halawah 2006 ; Wigﬁeld et al . 2008 ) . Although intrinsic and extrinsic motivations have been presented as contrasting components of motivation , research suggests that a combi - nation of both is particularly beneﬁcial for achievement ( Abuhamdeh and Csikszentmi - halyi 2009 ; Husman and Lens 1999 ) . Self - determination involves engaging in the learning process with a full sense of volition ( Deci et al . 1991 ; Wigﬁeld et al . 2008 ) . Studies connecting self - determination and student achievement have found that students with greater self - determination for com - pleting school work are more likely to succeed ( Deci et al . 1991 ; Wigﬁeld et al . 2008 ) . Two additional important components of motivation include task relevancy and self - efﬁcacy . Task relevancy is how important or useful a student ﬁnds a task , which allows the student to determine whether the task is worth pursuing ( Liem et al . 2008 ; Pintrich and Schunk 2002 ) . Self - efﬁcacy is an individual’s beliefs about his or her ability to perform in a speciﬁc domain , and can inﬂuence a student’s performance ( Pajares and Miller 1994 ; Wolters and Pintrich 2001 ) . Each of the aforementioned motivational components is how we are deﬁning and assessing the construct of motivation in the current study . Goal orientation : approach goals Building on the CRKM , Sinatra and Pintrich ( 2003 ) , emphasized the importance of stu - dents’ goal orientation on conceptual change . Students with a mastery goal orientation engage in school work in order to understand and learn ; their focus is on mastering the content . In contrast , students with a performance goal orientation are concerned with illustrating their ability and appearing competent ( Mason et al . 2006 ) . Linnenbrink and Pintrich ( 2002 ) found that physics students with a mastery goal orientation showed greater conceptual change in comparison to students with a performance goal orientation . The research on goal orientation tends to break down mastery and performance goals into approach and avoidance dimensions . Performance goals are divided into performance - approach ( i . e . , attempting to outperform others or appear competent ) and performance - avoidance goals ( i . e . , attempting to avoid doing worse than others or attempting to avoid appearing incompetent ) . Likewise , mastery goals are divided into mastery - approach ( i . e . , attempting to learn or improve knowledge and skills ) and mastery - avoidance goals ( i . e . , striving to avoid learning failures or avoiding skill decline ) ( Pintrich 2000 ) . More current research on goal orientation has emphasized the approach – avoidance dimensions of the two goal orientations ( Elliot and Murayama 2008 ; Senko et al . 2011 ) . This research suggests that many of the negative effects linked to performance goals are A multivariate model of conceptual change 127 123 associated with performance - avoidance goals ( Elliot and Moller 2003 ) . Likewise , mastery - avoidance goals are associated with negative results including poor motivation and low achievement ( Van Yperen et al . 2009 ) . Researchers are currently focusing on the beneﬁts of a combination of performance - approach and mastery - approach goals to optimize motivation and achievement ( Senko et al . 2011 ) . Research suggests that having a com - bination of both a mastery and performance approach orientation is superior to having just a mastery - approach orientation or performance - approach orientation alone ( Pintrich et al . 2003 ) . One goal of the present study was to extend the research on goal orientation and conceptual change and examine the impact of approach goals ( both mastery - approach and performance - approach ) on conceptual change in physics . In a physics course , some stu - dents might pursue a mastery - approach goal , working to learn the material deeply , while at the same time pursuing a performance - approach goal , focusing on outperforming others when studying for exams . It was hypothesized that in a physics course , a combination of a performance and mastery approach orientation would enhance motivation and conceptual change . Achievement emotions Emotions can impact the energy and efforts needed to rouse , focus , and endure behaviors necessary to achieve a particular goal ( Hannula 2006 ; Pekrun et al . 2002 ) . For this reason , emotions have been directly linked to motivation and achievement ( Frenzel et al . 2007 ; Pekrun 2006 ; Pekrun et al . 2002 ; Pekrun and Stephens 2009 ) . In academia , achievement emotions are emotions experienced in relation to a speciﬁc academic activity . The achievement emotions reported in the research include positive emotions such as enjoyment , relief , pride , and hope , and negative emotions such as shame , hopelessness , anxiety , boredom , and anger ( e . g . , Pekrun et al . 2011 ) . These emotions are domain speciﬁc ( Pekrun 2006 ) , and inﬂuence motivation as well as cognitive processes , such as memory storage and retrieval , attention , perception , decision making , and problem solving ( Frenzel et al . 2007 ; Pekrun et al . 2002 ; Pekrun and Stephens 2009 ) . For example , positive emotions that create favorable moods during cognitive problem solving have been found to support creative and ﬂexible ways of problem solving ( Frenzel et al . 2007 ; Pekrun 2006 ; Pekrun et al . 2002 ; Pekrun and Stephens 2009 ) . The research on the role of achievement emotions on conceptual change is relatively new ( Sinatra et al . 2014 ) . The existing research indicates that negative emotions are related to a lack of conceptual change whereas positive emotions are related to conceptual change or show no association ( Broughton et al . 2013 ; Heddy and Sinatra 2013 ; Linnenbrink and Pintrich 2002 ) . In the present study , we chose to start by exploring three emotions that we thought were relevant to conceptual change in physics including enjoyment , anxiety , and boredom . These emotions are directly related to the CRKM due to their relationship with engagement , which is an essential aspect of the CRKM and is theorized to be the main factor that predicts conceptual change . For example , enjoyment , a positive activating emotion ( arousal causing ) has been shown to be related to engagement ( Heddy and Sinatra 2013 ) , whereas boredom , for example , is a negative deactivating emotion that leads to disengagement ( Gregoire 2003 ) . The three emotions explored in the present study are discussed in greater detail below . Enjoyment has been found to be positively related to student motivation and perfor - mance ( Pekrun et al . 2002 ; Pekrun and Stephens 2009 ) . Research has shown signiﬁcant relationships between levels of enjoyment and motivational components such as control 128 G . Taasoobshirazi et al . 123 and value . This research indicates that when enjoyment is high , so are levels of control and value ( Pekrun et al . 2002 ) . In addition , research has shown a positive link between enjoyment and mastery goals ( Pekrun et al . 2009 ) . Boredom and anxiety , both negative emotions , have been found to be negatively related to student motivation and performance ( Pekrun et al . 2010 , 2002 ; Pekrun and Stephens 2009 ) . When a student experiences negative emotions such as boredom and anxiety , task irrelevant thinking often occurs ( Pekrun et al . 2002 ) . In addition , more attention and cognitive resources are allocated to the emotion rather than the activity at hand ( Frenzel et al . 2007 ; Pekrun et al . 2010 , 2002 ; Pekrun and Stephens 2009 ) . For instance , if a student feels bored when solving science problems , cognitive resources are allocated to the feeling of boredom and , as a result , less cognitive resources are allocated to the problem - solving task ( Pekrun et al . 2002 ; Pekrun and Stephens 2009 ) . A study with university students found that boredom was negatively related to intrinsic motivation , self - regulation , effort , achievement , and use of advanced cognitive and metacognitive strategies ( Pekrun et al . 2010 ) . In addition , research has shown a negative link between boredom and mastery goals ( Pekrun et al . 2009 ) . Similarly , anxiety has been found to be negatively related to intrinsic motivation , self - regulation , and achievement ( Pekrun et al . 2002 ) and positively linked to performance avoidance goals ( Pekrun et al . 2009 ) . One goal of the present study was to extend the research on conceptual change , achievement emotions , and science education by examining the role of emotions on conceptual change in physics when several variables are considered together . Need for cognition Need for cognition is the propensity to engage in and to prefer effortful cognitive tasks ( Cacioppo et al . 1996 ) . In Dole and Sinatra’s ( 1998 ) CRKM , need for cognition is a key variable inﬂuencing conceptual change . Individuals with a high need for cognition enjoy the challenge of questioning ideas , weighing issues and arguments , and are willing to engage deeply with the material they are learning , all of which facilitates conceptual change ( Sinatra and Pintrich 2003 ) . Although need for cognition has been studied in conceptual change research , in physics , however , there is a dearth of research examining the impact of need for cognition on conceptual change . In addition , little research has considered the impact of need for cognition on conceptual change when other key variables are considered . Cognitive engagement In the CRKM , cognitive engagement mediates the relationship between individual dif - ference variables and conceptual change . The CRKM model suggests that deep cognitive engagement results in greater conceptual change than shallow cognitive engagement . Shallow cognitive engagement involves shallow , superﬁcial , and surface - level processing . In contrast , deep cognitive engagement involves deeper processing of the material ( Dole and Sinatra 1998 ; Greene et al . 2003 ) . Deep cognitive engagement is an attempt by the learner to think about the main principles and underlying concepts ; shallow cognitive engagement involves rote processing and is an attempt by the learner to just memorize the content ( Greene et al . 2003 ) . Research has shown that deep cognitive engagement in the form of meaningful processing strategies leads to higher achievement ( Greene et al . 2003 ) . In fact , research suggests that cognitive engagement is a mediator between achievement emotions and achievement ( Linnenbrink and Pintrich 2004 ; Pekrun 2006 ; Pekrun and A multivariate model of conceptual change 129 123 Linnenbrink - Garcia 2012 ) . In addition , motivational variables and a mastery goal orien - tation have been linked to deep cognitive engagement ( Walker et al . 2006 ; Meece et al . 1988 ) . One goal of this study was to examine deep cognitive engagement as a mediator between emotions , motivation , approach goals , and achievement and conceptual change . Present study Only one study has tested , using structural equation modeling , how some of the variables described in the CRKM , including motivation , goal orientation , need for cognition , and course grades work together to inﬂuence conceptual change in physics ( Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra 2011 ) . Findings from the study indicated that need for cognition and approach goals were linked to physics motivation . Motivation , in turn , inﬂuenced course grades and conceptual change . Course grades also inﬂuenced conceptual change . The goal of the present study was to extend the study by Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra ( 2011 ) and examine how the variables listed above , as well as additional ones , are linked to conceptual change in physics . Speciﬁcally , the current study examines the role of cogni - tive , motivational , and affective variables together in a model by testing motivation , goal orientation ( approach goals ) , need for cognition , course grades , achievement emotions : boredom , anxiety , and enjoyment , and deep cognitive engagement as predictors of gain scores on the Force Concept Inventory ( FCI ) . By quantifying the relative contributions of each variable , we can determine which variables most inﬂuence conceptual change . The knowledge that results from studying these variables can be used to improve the teaching and learning of physics by allowing researchers to intervene and focus on the most important variables that contribute conceptual change . The theoretical model presented in Fig . 1 is based on the CRKM and the current research on conceptual change and indicates that emotions ( boredom , anxiety , and enjoyment ) inﬂuence motivational variables ( approach goals and motivation ) . Need for Fig . 1 Theoretical model of conceptual change in physics 130 G . Taasoobshirazi et al . 123 cognition also directly inﬂuences both approach goals and motivation . Approach goals are expected to be linked to higher motivation and deep cognitive engagement . Motivation is linked to deep cognitive engagement , course grade , and conceptual change . Deep cognitive engagement is expected to impact course grade and conceptual change . Finally , course grade is expected to be directly linked to conceptual change . Method Participants At a public university with over 21 , 000 undergraduate students in the southwestern United States , we studied 117 students ( 87 men and 30 women ) from a total of 204 students ( approximately 139 men and 65 women ) enrolled in three sections of an introductory - level , college physics course required for physics majors . The same physics professor taught all sections of the course , and all sections were taught using the same curriculum and assessments . Regarding ethnicity , 46 students were Caucasian ( 39 % ) , 32 were Asian or Paciﬁc Islander ( 27 % ) , 15 were Hispanic , Latino , or Spanish ( 13 % ) , and 9 were African American ( 8 % ) . Eleven students answered other or did not respond to the demographics question regarding ethnicity and two students indicated that they were mixed by marking two responses . Overall , a majority of the students participated ( 57 % ) . Students’ partici - pation was voluntary rather than required , in line with the guidelines for research with human participants as indicated by the institutional review board . The materials described below were given to students as a packet to complete at the end of the semester , before the administration of the post Force Concept Inventory . Procedure and materials Force concept inventory Students spent almost all of the semester covering mechanics . The Force Concept Inventory ( FCI ) was administered twice : once during the ﬁrst week of the class and again during the last week of the class . The FCI is an inventory designed to assess student misconceptions in physics ( Hestenes et al . 1992 ) . The FCI is comprised of 30 multiple - choice items that assess common misconceptions in mechanics , including kinematics , Newton’s ﬁrst , second , and third laws , the Superposition Principle ( vector sums and canceling forces ) , and forces ( Savinainen and Scott 2002 ) . The FCI is typically administered at the beginning and end of an introductory - level high school or college physics course to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction . Effectiveness of instruction or change scores on the FCI is measured by gain scores for each student which is deﬁned as : G = ( posttest % - pre - test % ) / ( 100 - pre - test % ) , with larger positive values indicat - ing greater gain scores ( Knight 2002 ; Mazur 1997 ) . For the present study , conceptual change was assessed using gain scores on the FCI . Reliability and discriminant and convergent validity have been previously established for the FCI ( Savinainen and Scott 2002 ) . For the present study , coefﬁcient alpha was . 81 for pre - testing and . 83 for post - testing . A multivariate model of conceptual change 131 123 Course grade Students’ self - reported course grade up until towards the end of the semester was obtained and scored 1 = F , 2 = D , 3 = C , 4 = B , and 5 = A . It was expected that students who showed evidence of learning the mechanics material in the form of higher course grades would show greater conceptual change . Motivation The Physics Motivation Questionnaire was used to assess physics motivation ( PMQ ) ( Glynn et al . 2007 ) . The 25 PMQ items administered to students assessed ﬁve important components of student motivation in physics including intrinsically motivated physics learning , extrinsically motivated physics learning , relevance of learning physics to per - sonal goals , self - determination for learning physics , and self - efﬁcacy in learning physics . The PMQ also includes test anxiety as an additional , sixth component of motivation . This component , however , was not included in our analysis of the PMQ because anxiety was studied as an emotion in our model . Students responded to the 25 randomly ordered items on a 5 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( always ) . Previous ﬁndings ( Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra 2011 ) indicate that the PMQ is reliable ( a = 0 . 84 ) , and valid in terms of positive correlations with college students’ self - reported physics grade and physics motivation . For this study , coefﬁcient alpha was found to be ( a = 0 . 92 ) . Approach goal orientation Approach goals were assessed using the performance - approach and mastery - approach items from the Achievement Goal Questionnaire ( AGQ ) ( Elliot and Murayama 2008 ) . The six items assessing approach goals ( three performance - approach items and three mastery - approach items ) were on a 5 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) and were adapted to focus on the domain of physics ( e . g . , ‘‘I am striving to do well compared to other students’’ revised to ‘‘I am striving to do well compared to other physics students’’ ) . In previous studies , the mastery - approach goals and performance - approach goals subscales have illustrated high levels of internal consistency ( Cronbach’s a = 0 . 84 and 0 . 92 ) ( Elliot and Murayama 2008 ) . For this study , the combined coefﬁcient alpha for the two approach orientations was found to be 0 . 85 . Construct validity of the AGQ , as established by a conﬁrmatory factor analysis , is provided by Elliot and Murayama ( 2008 ) . Need for cognition To assess need for cognition , the 18 - item Need for Cognition scale was administered ( Cacioppo et al . 1984 ) . Students responded to each item ( e . g . , I really enjoy a task that involves coming up with new solutions to problems ) using a 5 - point Likert scale ( 1 = not like me and 5 = very much like me ) where a higher score indicated a higher need for cognition . The scale’s reliability , as indicated by coefﬁcient alpha , has been reported as 0 . 90 ( Cacioppo et al . 1984 ) . For the present study , coefﬁcient alpha was found to be 0 . 81 . Convergent and discriminant validity is established and provided by Cacioppo and Petty ( 1982 ) . 132 G . Taasoobshirazi et al . 123 Achievement emotions Components of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire ( AEQ ) were used to assess students’ emotions when studying physics ( Pekrun et al . 2011 ) . The items were revised so that they were speciﬁc to physics . For example , an enjoyment item ‘‘I enjoy acquiring new knowledge’’ was revised to ‘‘I enjoy acquiring new physics knowledge . ’’ Students were administered 31 items that assessed three important components of student achievement emotions including enjoyment when studying physics ( e . g . , ‘‘I look forward to studying physics’’ ) , boredom when studying physics ( e . g . , ‘‘Studying for my physics class bores me’’ ) , and anxiety when studying physics ( e . g . , ‘‘I get tense and nervous while studying physics’’ ) . Students responded to the 31 items ( 10 enjoyment items , 11 boredom items , and 11 anxiety items ) that were grouped by emotion on a 5 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( always ) . Construct validity for the AEQ has been established as has the reliability of the instrument and its components ( Pekrun et al . 2011 ) . For the present study , internal consistency for the enjoyment items was found to be ( a = . 89 ) . Internal consis - tency for the boredom items was found to be ( a = . 95 ) . Internal consistency for the anxiety items was found to be ( a = . 92 ) . Cognitive engagement Six items derived from the 26 item Approaches to Learning instrument were used to measure deep cognitive engagement ( Greene et al . 2004 ) . The items were revised to focus on the domain of physics ( e . g . , ‘‘When I solve problems , I think about the underlying principles of the problems’’ was revised to ‘‘When I solve physics problems , I think about the underlying principles of the problems’’ ) . Students responded to the items on a 6 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 6 ( strongly agree ) . Information about reliability and validity of the Approaches to Learning Instrument is described in ( Greene et al . 2004 ) . For the present study , internal consistency for the deep cognitive engagement items was found to be a = . 82 . There were approximately 13 items with missing data on the questionnaires . 1 Mean substitution ( e . g . , using the other items for the relevant component of the questionnaire for an individual ) was used to replace missing data . If a student marked two responses for an item , the mean of the two responses was taken . On the FCI test , there were a total of ten missing data points or data with more than one response ( four items on the pre - FCI and eight items on the post - FCI ) . These responses were scored as a zero for an incorrect response . Results The Statistical Program for the Social Sciences , version 21 . 0 was used to analyze descriptive statistics , mean comparisons , and correlations among the model variables . Structural equation modeling , speciﬁcally path analysis , was used to test the relationships among the model variables . Speciﬁcally , LISREL with a covariance matrix generated by PRELIS was used to test the model . 1 For course grade , motivation , need for cognition , deep engagement , boredom , anxiety , enjoyment , and approach goals . A multivariate model of conceptual change 133 123 Mean comparisons and correlations Independent samples t tests indicated no signiﬁcant gender differences among the model variables . A one - way ANOVA indicated that Caucasian students have higher conceptual change scores ( gain on the FCI ) when compared to Asians / Paciﬁc Islander , African Americans , and Hispanics / Latino / Spanish students ( F = 2 . 876 , p = . 01 ; follow up post hoc tests using Fisher’s LSD with p’s \ . 05 ) . Correlations among the model variables are reported in Table 1 . Path model results Before testing the model , the data were examined for both univariate and multivariate normality . Based on skewness and kurtosis statistics ( Table 1 ) and a relative multivariate kurtosis value of 1 . 056 , the data met the assumptions of both univariate and multivariate normality . As a result , we used maximum likelihood estimation to test the model . Several ﬁt indices were used to assess model ﬁt . The Chi square statistic was v 2 ( 14 ) = 33 . 65 , p = . 0023 . The v 2 / df ratio was 2 . 40 . The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation ( RMSEA ) was . 10 . The standardized root - mean - square residual ( SRMR ) was . 085 . Finally , the Bentler comparative ﬁt index ( CFI ) was . 97 . Although the v 2 / df ratio and CFI met recommended cutoff values for good model ﬁt , the RMSEA and SRMR were both slightly above recommended cutoff values ( e . g . , Bentler 1990 ; Browne & Cudeck 1993 ; Hoyle and Panter 1995 ; Hu and Bentler 1999 ; Kline 2005 ) . We thus interpreted the model as having good to moderate ﬁt . Also , the exogenous achievement emotions variables were allowed to covary when testing the model in LISREL . The standardized path values for the model and the associated t values are reported in Table 2 . A cutoff value of t = 1 . 96 for a two - tailed test was used to determine statistical signiﬁcance of the path values . The criterion R 2 ( proportion of variance explained ) for approach goals was . 34 , for motivation was . 73 , for deep engagement was . 33 , for course Table 1 Correlation matrix , means , standard deviations , skewness , and kurtosis Variable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 .

To interpret the size and inﬂuence of the standardized path values , which range from 0 to 1 , we adopted criteria parallel to those of Keith ( 1993 ) .

Taasoobshirazi et al . 123 boredom to motivation and the paths from anxiety to approach goals and anxiety to motivation were all non - signiﬁcant . This indicated that neither of the negative emotions was linked to the motivational variables . Approach goals had signiﬁcant and large paths to motivation and to deep cognitive engagement . Motivation had large and signiﬁcant paths to deep cognitive engagement and to course grade . Deep cognitive engagement had a signiﬁcant and medium sized path to course grade . Course grade had a large and signiﬁcant inﬂuence on conceptual change on the FCI . Need for cognition played no role in the model as the paths from need for cognition to the motivational variables were not signiﬁcant . In terms of indirect paths , enjoyment was the only achievement emotion variable that played a role in the model based on signiﬁcant medium and large sized indirect paths from enjoyment to motivation , deep cognitive engagement , course grade , and conceptual change ( please see Table 2 for all indirect path values ) . The signiﬁcant indirect paths from approach goals to deep cognitive engagement , course grade , and conceptual change , and the signiﬁcant indirect path from motivation to conceptual change illustrate the importance of motivational variables on conceptual change learning . Because boredom , anxiety , and need for cognition played no role in our model , and because a model may be misspeciﬁed if unnecessary paths and variables are included ( Kline 2005 ; Pedhazur 1997 ) , we tested our model without these three variables .

Figure 3 illustrates the model and the standardized path values . The direct path from enjoyment to approach goals was large and signiﬁcant indicating that enjoyment when studying physics is linked to an approach goal orientation . Enjoyment also had a large and signiﬁcant path to motivation , indicating that enjoyment when learning physics is linked to higher motivation . Approach goals had signiﬁcant and large paths to motivation and to deep cognitive engagement . Motivation had large and signiﬁcant paths to deep cognitive engagement and to course grade . Deep cognitive engagement had a signiﬁcant and medium sized path to course grade . Course grade had a large and signiﬁcant inﬂuence on conceptual change on the FCI . Neither motivation nor deep cognitive engagement directly inﬂuenced conceptual change . Both , however , were directly linked to course grade . This was the case for both the initial and revised models . In terms of indirect paths , enjoyment had signiﬁcant medium and large indirect paths to motivation , deep cognitive engagement , course grade , and conceptual change ( please see Table 2 for all indirect path values ) . The signiﬁcant , medium sized indirect paths from approach goals to deep cognitive engagement , course grade , and conceptual change , and the signiﬁcant , medium sized indirect path from motivation to conceptual change illustrate the importance of motivational variables on conceptual change learning . Finally , there was also a signiﬁcant and small indirect path from deep cognitive engagement to conceptual change through course grade . This indicates that although deep cognitive engagement is not linked to conceptual change directly , it does inﬂuence conceptual change indirectly through course grade . Discussion The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship among learner characteristics expected to inﬂuence conceptual change . This study extends the study by Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra ( 2011 ) using the CRKM as a framework to examine the contribution and inﬂuence of multiple cognitive , motivational , and affective variables on conceptual change . Testing the model in the present study also allowed us to assess the validity of the CRKM . In the following sections we discuss both theoretical and practical implications of our ﬁndings . Theoretical implications Results indicated that enjoyment played an important role in the model , whereas boredom and anxiety played no role in the model . Therefore , enjoyment , a positive activating emotion , seemed to play an important role in the conceptual change process . Our ﬁndings on the importance of positive emotions such as enjoyment corroborate those found in previous research ( Broughton et al . 2013 ; Heddy and Sinatra 2013 ) . Thus , we purport that affect , and in particular positive achievement emotions such as enjoyment , need to be 138 G . Taasoobshirazi et al . 123 added to the CRKM model as an integral learner characteristic in the conceptual change process given the existing evidence on the impact of emotions on knowledge change . Although we explored the role of three emotions on conceptual change in physics , we encourage researchers to examine the impact of the other six emotions on the conceptual change process in physics . Both motivation and approach goal orientations played a signiﬁcant role in both our initial and revised models , inﬂuencing course grade and conceptual change . Dole and Sinatra ( 1998 ) included motivation as an important learner characteristic in the CRKM model . Our results conﬁrm and extend their hypothesis on the impact that motivation has on conceptual change . In particular , we contend that goal orientation be added to the model as a separate learner characteristic from motivation due to the abundance of research that conﬁrms its importance as an essential variable in the conceptual change process ( e . g . , Johnson and Sinatra 2013 ) . Furthermore , our deﬁnition of motivation was very broad in that it comprised several sub - constructs including intrinsic motivation , extrinsic motiva - tion , self - determination , task relevancy , and self - efﬁcacy . Thus , we recommend that future research explore the impact of each individual aspect of learner motivation , possibly through multiple regression analyses . Doing so would provide a clearer picture of to what extent individual aspects of learner motivation impact conceptual change , which would further increase the explanatory power of the CRKM model . Finally , we argue that motivation , along with emotions , be considered integral aspects of the CRKM model . Unsurprisingly , we found that course grades had a direct signiﬁcant relationship with conceptual change . We suggest that students with higher course grades are higher achieving students in general and thus have greater content knowledge and / or better learning strategies as suggested in previous research ( Zimmerman 1990 ) . Greater learning and knowledge of the course material , as evidenced by higher course grades , would likely result in a reduction of incorrect conceptions . Despite the signiﬁcant and medium sized correlations between need for cognition and approach goals and need for cognition and motivation , neither path values were signiﬁcant when all of the different variables were considered in combination . This is likely because the stronger relationships between the other model variables resulted in this relationship coming up as unimportant . In previous research , Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra ( 2011 ) found that need for cognition was a signiﬁcant predictor of conceptual change . However , many of the variables in the current study were not included . Therefore , we suggest that need for cognition is still an important factor when attempting to explain conceptual change . However , other variables such as motivation , approach goals , and course grades are more important and reduce the impact of need for cognition . Furthermore , the limited role of need for cognition may also be a function of the fact that need for cognition assessed students’ need for cognitive activity in general whereas the other variables in the model focused speciﬁcally on physics . One important ﬁnding from the current study was that neither motivation nor deep cognitive engagement was directly linked to conceptual change . Both , however , were directly linked to course grade . This was the case for both the initial and revised models . In the initial and revised models , motivation indirectly inﬂuenced conceptual change through its inﬂuence on course grade ; in the revised model , deep cognitive engagement indirectly impacted conceptual change through course grade . This ﬁnding regarding engagement has considerable theoretical implications because engagement is the key factor that directly impacts conceptual change in the CRKM model as designed by Dole and Sinatra ( 1998 ) . We found that engagement was not directly linked to conceptual change , which can be interpreted in many ways including : poor measurement of engagement , focus on cognitive A multivariate model of conceptual change 139 123 engagement alone , non - engaging activity , and the necessity to modify the CRKM model . Each of these interpretations is discussed in depth below . To begin , the ﬁnding that engagement was not related to conceptual change could simply be a product of poor instrumentation . Although we implemented a widely used cognitive engagement instrument ( Greene et al . 2004 ) , recently the use of self - report to assess cognitive engagement has been called into question , which is signiﬁcant because the scholar who questions the usefulness of self - report developed the survey implemented in the current study ( Greene 2015 ) . Greene suggests that self - report alone is not enough to measure engagement in a trustworthy way and that triangulation should occur , which would combine self - report with other types of instrumentation such as qualitative ethnography ( Ryu and Lombardi 2015 ) , data analytics ( Gobert et al . 2015 ) , reading time ( Miller 2015 ) , and physiological measurements ( Azevedo 2015 ) . Each form of instru - mentation assesses engagement at a different grain size , which means that engagement is occurring at different levels from context oriented ( e . g . teacher check lists ) , to per - son / context oriented ( e . g . self - report ; experience - sampling ) , to person oriented ( e . g . physiological instruments ) and thus would be assessed differently ( Sinatra et al . 2015 ) . Future research would beneﬁt from triangulating engagement instrumentation , taking grain size into consideration , and measuring the construct in several different ways to conﬁrm ﬁndings . Another interpretation of the null path between engagement and conceptual change is that assessing cognitive engagement alone is a faulty practice . Engagement is hypothesized to have three components including cognitive , affective , and behavioral ( Fredricks et al . 2004 ) . Each dimension of engagement is suspected to overlap in such a way that assessing one dimension without also assessing the others is improbable and incomplete ( Sinatra et al . 2015 ) . Therefore , it may be necessary to also measure behavioral and affective engagement to make a trustworthy claim on the impact that engagement has on conceptual change . In the current study we assessed emotions and self - determination , which could be related to affective and behavioral engagement respectively . Both emotions ( indirect inﬂuence ) and motivation ( direct inﬂuence ) were signiﬁcantly linked to cognitive engagement , which may be evidence that affective and behavioral engagement are related to cognitive engagement , but each inﬂuence conceptual change more than cognitive engagement . An entirely plausible claim is that instruction in the current study may have been implemented in such a way that the use of deep learning strategies were not necessary to succeed . There was no connection between physics and students’ everyday experience , which was found to facilitate engagement in previous research ( Heddy and Sinatra 2013 ) . Nor was there any use of refutation style instruction or refutation text , which has also found to be engaging ( Broughton et al . 2013 ) . More research needs to be conducted on how different forms of instruction may impact cognitive engagement and subsequently con - ceptual change . A ﬁnal theoretical implication based on our ﬁndings is that the CRKM model should be modiﬁed to incorporate the years of research on both learner and message characteristics . The CRKM was developed almost 20 years ago ( Dole and Sinatra 1998 ) , and since then much research has both provided support for and against many aspects of the model . On the one hand , there appears to be clear support that characteristics such as motivation ( Pintrich et al . 1993 ) , personal relevance ( Heddy and Sinatra 2013 ) , and plausibility ( Lombardi and Sinatra 2013 ) impact conceptual change as predicted by the CRKM . On the other hand , there has been mixed support for characteristics such as need for cognition ( Taasoobshirazi and Sinatra 2011 ; current study ) and engagement ( current study ; Heddy 140 G . Taasoobshirazi et al . 123 and Sinatra 2013 ) . In particular , engagement may not be the most integral aspect predicting conceptual change as is suggested in the current CRKM . Furthermore , motivation is an umbrella term that includes several sub - constructs ( Glynn et al . 2007 ) . Exploring how each of these sub - constructs impacts conceptual change and including them into the model separately would paint a more comprehensive picture of aspects that impact conceptual change . Given all of these ﬁndings and others , the time has come to update the CRKM to better represent characteristics of conceptual change , a task that we urge scholars to undertake . Practical implications In physics classrooms , we should be focusing on making physics more enjoyable and on increasing student motivation and fostering an approach goal orientation . In addition , efforts to increase student knowledge of physics will increase the likelihood of conceptual change . Innovative physics instructional techniques can help make physics more enjoyable for students , increase their motivation to learn , increase their level of cognitive engage - ment , and improve their problem solving and achievement ( e . g . , Neumann and Welzel 2007 ) . For example , there is a large body of research indicating that efforts to make physics more relevant to students by contextualizing the material makes physics more interesting , enjoyable , and increases student motivation ( Kaschalk 2002 ; Rayner 2005 ) . We advocate instructional techniques that show evidence of improved knowledge , motivation , engagement , and affect when compared to traditional physics instruction . We know that increasing student knowledge , motivation , engagement , and affect are important for con - ceptual change . Researchers recommend that instructors integrate controversial and meaningful dis - cussion in their classrooms to support positive attitudes , engagement , and conceptual change ( e . g . , Broughton et al . 2013 ) . This can be done by having students critically evaluate different ideas and make judgments about the quality of the different ideas using evidence ( Nussbaum and Sinatra 2003 ) . For instance , research on refutation texts and instruction suggests having students compare alternative conceptions can facilitate learning and comprehension of scientiﬁcally accepted conceptions ( Broughton et al . 2013 ; Tippett 2010 ) . Therefore , rather than avoiding teaching conﬂicting conceptions , doing so can make a positive impact on generating more conceptual change . Research suggests that having both a mastery and performance approach orientation is better than having just a mastery - approach orientation or performance - approach orienta - tion alone ( Pintrich et al . 2003 ) . Johnson and Sinatra ( 2013 ) found that students with an approach orientation ( mastery and performance ) had higher conceptual change than those with an avoidance orientation . In the present study , we found that a combination of performance approach and mastery approach orientations is linked to conceptual change . Focusing on the approach versus avoidance dimensions of goal orientations is a relatively new area of research and has primarily shown the beneﬁts of a mastery and performance approach orientation combined . Although previous research has studied how to support a mastery goal orientation ( by providing students with classroom activities that are chal - lenging , meaningful , and authentic ) ( Pintrich et al . 1993 ) , more research needs to examine how to foster a combination of mastery and performance approach orientations together in order to maximize conceptual change . This , for example , can be done by giving students authentic tasks that challenge them but also tasks that provide enjoyable competition . A multivariate model of conceptual change 141 123 Conclusion We recommend that researchers extend the model tested in the present study to include additional variables described in the CRKM , including learner and contextual variables . Doing so will provide additional information regarding the validity of the CRKM and help us understand which variables are most important for conceptual change . This , in turn , will have signiﬁcant implications for the research on conceptual change and for the teaching of physics . References Abuhamdeh , S . , & Csikszentmihalyi , M . ( 2009 ) .
