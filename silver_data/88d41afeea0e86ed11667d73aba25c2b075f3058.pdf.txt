Analytical expressions for orientational correlation functions and for the persistence length of helices are derived , and it is found that this length varies non – monotonically with the strength of thermal ﬂuctuations . In the weak ﬂuctuation regime , the local helical structure is preserved and the statistical properties are dominated by long wavelength bending and torsion modes . As the amplitude of ﬂuctuations is increased , the helix “melts” and all memory of intrinsic helical structure is lost . Spontaneous twist of the cross – section leads to resonant dependence of the persistence length on the twist rate . 1 . Introduction Modern polymer physics is based on the notion that while real polymers can be arbitrarily complicated objects , their universal features are captured by a minimal model in which poly - mers are described as continuous random walks . While this approach has been enormously successful and led to numerous triumphs such as the understanding of rubber elasticity 3 , the solution of the excluded volume problem and the theory of semi – dilute polymer solutions 4 , it is ill – suited for the description of non – universal features of polymers which may depend 1 on their chemical structure in a way that can not be captured by a simple redeﬁnition of the eﬀective monomer size or its second virial coeﬃcient . For relatively simple synthetic poly - mers , such “local details” can be treated by polymer chemistry – type models ( e . g . , rotational isomer state model 5 ) . However , chemically – detailed approaches become prohibitively diﬃ - cult ( at least as far as analytical modeling is concerned ) in the case of complex biomolecules such as DNA , proteins and their assemblies and a new type of minimal models is needed to model recent mechanical experiments on such systems 6 – 14 . Such an alternative approach is to model polymers in the way one usually thinks of them , i . e . , as continuous elastic strings or ﬁlaments which can be arbitrarily deformed and twisted . However , while the theory of elasticity of such objects is well – developed 15 , little is known about the statistical mechanics of ﬂuctuating ﬁlaments with arbitrary natural shapes . The main diﬃculty is mathemati - cal in origin : the description of three – dimensional ﬁlaments with non – circular cross – section and non – vanishing spontaneous curvature and twist 16 , involves rather complicated diﬀeren - tial geometry 17 and most DNA – related theoretical studies of such models assumed circular cross – sections and focused on ﬂuctuations around the straight rod conﬁguration 18 – 22 . Recently , we reported a study of the eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuations on the statistical properties of ﬁlaments with arbitrary spontaneous curvature and twist 24 . In this work we present a detailed exposition of the theory and of its application to helical ﬁlaments . In Section 2 we introduce the description of the spatial conﬁguration of the ﬁlament in terms of a triad of unit vectors oriented along the principal axes of the ﬁlament , and show that all the information about this conﬁguration can be obtained from the knowledge of a set of generalized torsions . The elastic energy cost associated with any instantaneous conﬁguration of the ﬁlament , is expressed in terms of the deviations of the generalized torsions that describe this conﬁguration , from their spontaneous values in some given stress – free reference state . We use this energy to construct the statistical weights of the diﬀerent conﬁgurations and show that the deviations of the generalized torsions behave as Gaussian random noises , whose amplitudes are inversely proportional to the bare persistence lengths that characterize the rigidity associated with the diﬀerent deformation modes . We then derive the diﬀerential 2 equations for the orientational correlation functions that can be expressed as averages of a rotation matrix which generates the rotation of the triad vectors as one moves along the contour of the ﬁlament . An expression for the persistence length in terms of one of the correlators is derived . In Section 3 we apply the general formalism to helical ﬁlaments and derive exact expressions for the correlators ( see Appendix A ) and for the eﬀective persistence length of an untwisted helix . We show that the persistence length is , in general a non – monotonic function of the amplitudes of thermal ﬂuctuations . We also show that in the weak ﬂuctuation regime , our exact expressions for the correlators can be derived from a simpliﬁed long – wavelength description of the helix , which is equivalent to the incompressible rod – like chain model 20 , and that the ﬂuctuation spectrum is dominated by the Goldstone modes of this rod – like chain . Analytical expressions for the persistence length of a spontaneously twisted helix are derived ( see Appendix B ) and it is found that this length exhibits resonant – like dependence on the rate of twist . Finally , in Section 4 we discuss our results and outline directions for future research . 2 . General Theory of Fluctuating Filaments A ﬁlament of small but ﬁnite and , in general , non – circular cross – section , is modeled as an inextensible but deformable physical curve parametrized by a contour length s ( 0 ≤ s ≤ L where L is the length of the ﬁlament ) . To each point s one attaches a triad of unit vectors { t ( s ) } whose component t 3 is the tangent vector to the curve at s , and the vectors t 1 ( s ) and t 2 ( s ) are directed along the two axes of symmetry of the cross – section . The vectors { t ( s ) } , together with the inextensibility condition d x / ds = t 3 , give a complete description of the space curve x ( s ) , as well as of the rotation of the cross – section ( i . e . , twist ) about this curve . The rotation of all the vectors t i of the triad as one moves from point s to point s ′ along the line , is generated by the rotation matrix R ( s , s ′ ) t i ( s ) = X j R ij ( s , s ′ ) t j ( s ′ ) ( 1 ) The rotation matrix has the property 3 R ( s , s ′ ) = R ( s , s ′′ ) R ( s ′′ , s ′ ) ( 2 ) where s ′′ is an arbitrary point on the contour of the ﬁlament . It satisﬁes the equation ∂R ij ( s , s ′ ) ∂s = − X k Ω ik ( s ) R kj ( s , s ′ ) ( 3 ) where Ω ij = X k ε ijk ω k ( 4 ) ε ijk is the antisymmetric tensor and { ω k } will be referred to as generalized torsions , for lack of a better term . The above equations are supplemented by the “initial” condition R ij ( s , s ) = δ ij , where δ ij is the Kronecker delta function . The formal solution of Eq . ( 3 ) is given by the “time – ordered” exponential R ( s , s ′ ) = T s exp (cid:18) − Z s s ′ ds ′′ Ω ( s ′′ ) (cid:19) = lim ∆ s → 0 + e − Ω ( s n ) ∆ s · · · e − Ω ( s 2 ) ∆ s e − Ω ( s 1 ) ∆ s ( 5 ) The time – ordering operator with respect to s , T s is deﬁned by the second equality in the above equation , where we broke the interval s − s ′ into n parts of length ∆ s each , so that s 1 = s ′ and s n = s ′ . The origin of the diﬃculty in calculating the above expression is that the matrices Ω ( s ) and Ω ( s ′ ) do not commute for s 6 = s ′ ( this is related to the non – Abelian character of the rotation group in 3d ) . Eq . ( 3 ) is equivalent to a set of generalized Frenet equations from which one can calculate the spatial conﬁguration of the ﬁlament , given a set of generalized torsions { ω k } , d t 1 ds = ω 2 t 3 − ω 3 t 2 , d t 2 ds = − ω 1 t 3 + ω 3 t 1 , d t 3 ds = ω 1 t 2 − ω 2 t 1 ( 6 ) Note that in the original Frenet description of space curves in terms of a unit tangent ( which coincides with t 3 ) , normal ( n ) and binormal ( b ) , one considers mathematical lines for which it would be meaningless to deﬁne twist about the centerline 23 . The Frenet equations contain only two parameters : the curvature κ and torsion τ : d b ds = − τ n , d n ds = − κ t 3 + τ b , d t 3 ds = κ n ( 7 ) 4 The two frames are related through rotation by an angle α about the common tangent direction ( see Fig . 1 ) , t 1 = b cos α + n sin α , t 2 = − b sin α + n cos α ( 8 ) Substituting this relation into Eqs . ( 6 ) and using Eqs . ( 7 ) , we relate the generalized torsions { ω k } to the curvature κ , torsion τ and twist angle α , ω 1 = κ cos α , ω 2 = κ sin α , ω 3 = τ + dα / ds ( 9 ) The theory of elasticity of thin rods 15 is based on the notion that there exists a stress – free reference conﬁguration deﬁned by the set of spontaneous ( intrinsic ) torsions { ω 0 k } . The set { ω 0 k } together with Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ( with ω k → ω 0 k ) completely determines the equilibrium shape of the ﬁlament , in the absence of thermal ﬂuctuations . Neglecting excluded – volume eﬀects and other non – elastic interactions , it can be shown 25 that the elastic energy associated with some actual conﬁguration { ω k } of the ﬁlament is a quadratic form in the deviations δω k = ω k − ω 0 k U el ( { δω k } ) = kT 2 Z L 0 ds X k a k δω 2 k ( 10 ) where T is the temperature , k is the Boltzmann constant , and a i are bare persistence lengths that depend on the elastic constants and on the principal moments of inertia with respect to the symmetry axes of the cross – section , in a model – dependent way . Thus , assuming anisotropic elasticity ( with elastic moduli E i ) and a particular form of the deformation , one obtains 25 a 1 = E 1 I 1 / kT , a 2 = E 1 I 2 / kT and a 3 = E 2 ( I 1 + I 2 ) / kT where I i are the principal moments of inertia . In general , the theory of elasticity of incompressible isotropic rods with shear modulus µ yields 15 a 1 = 3 µI 1 / kT , a 2 = 3 µI 2 / kT , and a 3 = C / kT where the torsional rigidity C is also proportional to µ and depends on the geometry of the cross – section 26 ( for an elliptical cross – section with semi – axes b 1 and b 2 , C = πµb 31 b 32 / ( b 21 + b 22 ) ) . The elastic energy U el ( { δω k } ) determines the statistical weight of the conﬁguration { ω k } . The statistical average of any functional of the conﬁguration B ( { ω k } ) is deﬁned as the functional integral 5 h B ( { ω k } ) i = R D { δω k } B ( { ω k } ) e − U el { δω k } / kT R D { δω k } e − U el { δω k } / kT ( 11 ) Calculating the corresponding Gaussian path integrals we obtain h δω i ( s ) i = 0 , h δω i ( s ) δω j ( s ′ ) i = a − 1 i δ ij δ ( s − s ′ ) ( 12 ) We conclude that ﬂuctuations of generalized torsions at two diﬀerent points along the ﬁla - ment contour are uncorrelated , and that the amplitude of ﬂuctuations is inversely propor - tional to the corresponding bare persistence length . The statistical properties of ﬂuctuating ﬁlaments are determined by the orientational correlation functions , which can be expressed as averages of the elements of the rotation matrix , h t i ( s ) t j ( s ′ ) i = h R ij ( s , s ′ ) i = X k h R ik ( s , s ′′ ) R kj ( s ′′ , s ′ ) i ( 13 ) The last equality was written using Eq . ( 2 ) , with s > s ′′ > s ′ . Inspection of Eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 4 ) , shows that R ( s , s ′′ ) depends only the torsions ω k ( s 1 ) with s > s 1 > s ′′ , and that R ( s ′′ , s ′ ) depends only on ω k ( s 2 ) with s ′′ > s 2 > s ′ . Since ﬂuctuations of the torsion in two non – overlapping intervals are uncorrelated ( see Eq . ( 12 ) ) , the average of the product of rotation matrices splits into the product of their averages : h R ij ( s , s ′ ) i = X k h R ik ( s , s ′′ ) i h R kj ( s ′′ , s ′ ) i ( 14 ) In order to derive a diﬀerential equation for the averaged rotation matrix , we consider the limit ∆ s = s − s ′′ → 0 . Keeping terms to ﬁrst order in ∆ s we ﬁnd ∂ h R ij ( s , s ′ ) i ∂s = − X k Λ ik ( s ) h R kj ( s , s ′ ) i ( 15 ) where the matrix Λ is deﬁned as Λ ik ( s ) = lim ∆ s → 0 + δ ik − h R ik ( s , s − ∆ s ) i ∆ s ( 16 ) Analogously to Eq . ( 5 ) , the formal solution of Eq . ( 15 ) can be written as a time – ordered exponential , 6 h R ( s , s ′ ) i = T s exp (cid:18) − Z s s ′ ds ′′ Λ ( s ′′ ) (cid:19) ( 17 ) In order to calculate the matrix Λ we expand the exponential in Eq . ( 5 ) to second order in ∆ s = s − s ′ and use the property of time – ordering operator T s Z s s − ∆ s ds 1 Z s s − ∆ s ds 2 Ω ( s 1 ) Ω ( s 2 ) = Z s s − ∆ s ds 1 (cid:20)Z s 1 s − ∆ s ds 2 Ω ( s 1 ) Ω ( s 2 ) + Z s s 1 ds 2 Ω ( s 2 ) Ω ( s 1 ) (cid:21) ( 18 ) In order to average this equation , we ﬁrst calculate the average of the product Ω ( s 1 ) Ω ( s 2 ) , using Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 12 ) h Ω ( s 1 ) Ω ( s 2 ) i = h Ω ( s 1 ) i h Ω ( s 2 ) i + diag ( γ i ) δ ( s 1 − s 2 ) ( 19 ) where diag ( γ i ) is a diagonal matrix with elements γ i = X k 1 2 a k − 1 2 a i ( 20 ) Using Eqs . ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) , and keeping terms up to ﬁrst order in ∆ s ( upon integration , the contribution of h Ω ( s 1 ) i h Ω ( s 2 ) i is of order ( ∆ s ) 2 ) , yields Λ ik = γ i δ ik + X l ε ikl ω 0 l ( 21 ) The elements of the averaged rotation matrix are simply the correlators of the triad vectors ( see Eq . ( 13 ) ) . From the knowledge of the above correlators one can calculate other statistical properties of ﬂuctuating ﬁlaments , the most familiar of which is the persistence length l p , that can be interpreted as an eﬀective statistical segment length of a coarse – grained model , in which one replaces the ﬁlament by a random walk with the same contour length L and rms end – to – end separation h r 2 i : l p = lim L →∞ 1 L D r 2 E The end – to – end vector is deﬁned as r = R L 0 t 3 ( s ) ds and thus l p = lim L →∞ 2 L Z L 0 ds Z s 0 ds ′ h t 3 ( s ) t 3 ( s ′ ) i ( 22 ) The above equations describe the ﬂuctuations of ﬁlaments of arbitrary shape and elastic properties , and in the following this general formalism is applied to helical ﬁlaments . 7 3 . Fluctuating Helices A . Untwisted Helix : Correlation Functions and Persistence Length Consider a helical ﬁlament without spontaneous twist , such that the generalized sponta - neous torsions { ω 0 k } are independent of position s along the contour . In order to describe the stress – free conﬁguration of such a ﬁlament , it is convenient to introduce the conventional Frenet triad which consists of the tangent , normal and binormal to the space curve spanned by the centerline , supplemented by a constant angle of twist α 0 which describes the orien - tation of the cross – section in the plane normal to the centerline . According to the general relation between the two frames , Eq . ( 9 ) , ω 01 = κ 0 cos α 0 , ω 02 = κ 0 sin α 0 and ω 03 = τ 0 , where κ 0 and τ 0 are the constant curvature and torsion of the space curve in terms of which the total spontaneous curvature that deﬁnes rate of rotation of the helix about its long axis , is given by ω 0 = ( κ 20 + τ 20 ) 1 / 2 . The corresponding helical pitch is 2 πτ 0 / ω 20 and the radius of the helical turn is 2 πκ 0 / ω 20 . We proceed to calculate the orientational correlation functions . Since Λ is a constant matrix , Eq . ( 17 ) yields ( for s 1 > s 2 ) h t i ( s 1 ) t j ( s 2 ) i = h e − Λ ( s 1 − s 2 ) i ij ( 23 ) In order to calculate the matrix e − Λ ( s 1 − s 2 ) we ﬁrst ﬁnd the eigenvalues λ i of the matrix Λ , which are determined by the characteristic polynomial λ 3 − γλ 2 + µλ − ν = 0 ( 24 ) where we introduced the notations γ = γ 1 + γ 2 + γ 3 = a − 1 1 + a − 1 2 + a − 1 3 , ( 25 ) µ = ω 20 + γ 1 γ 2 + γ 2 γ 3 + γ 1 γ 3 , ( 26 ) ν = κ 20 (cid:16) γ 1 cos 2 α 0 + γ 2 sin 2 α 0 (cid:17) + τ 20 γ 3 + γ 1 γ 2 γ 3 ( 27 ) The solution of this cubic equation depends on the sign of the expression 8 ∆ = 27 ( ν − ν 1 ) 2 + 4 (cid:16) µ − γ 2 / 3 (cid:17) 3 , ν 1 = 1 3 γµ − 2 27 γ 3 ( 28 ) For ∆ < 0 all the roots λ i are real . In this parameter range , ﬂuctuations are strong enough to destroy the helical structure on all length scales . In the limit of very strong ﬂuctuations when the bare persistence lengths are much smaller than the radii of curvature γ ≫ ω 0 , we have λ i → γ i and correlation functions become h t i ( s 1 ) t j ( s 2 ) i = e − γ i ( s 1 − s 2 ) δ ij ( 29 ) with s 1 − s 2 > 0 . Eq . ( 29 ) shows that although angular correlations remain on length scales smaller than 1 / λ i , they are identical to those of a persistent rod and do not carry any memory of the original helix . In the case ∆ > 0 , there is one real eigenvalue , λ 1 , and two complex ones , λ 2 , 3 = λ R ± iω , where λ 1 = K 6 − 2 µ − γ 2 / 3 K + γ 3 , λ R = γ − λ 1 2 ( 30 ) ω = √ 3 K 12 + µ − γ 2 / 3 K ! , K = 12 1 / 3 h 9 ( ν − ν 1 ) + √ 3∆ i 1 / 3 ( 31 ) It is shown in Appendix A that the diagonal orientational correlation functions take the form h t i ( s 1 ) t i ( s 2 ) i = ( 1 − c i − c ∗ i ) e − λ 1 s + (cid:16) c i e − iωs + c ∗ i e iωs (cid:17) e − λ R s ( 32 ) where s = s 1 − s 2 > 0 . The complex coeﬃcients c i are calculated in Appendix A . In the limit of small ﬂuctuations , γ ≪ ω 0 , we have λ 1 = X i ( 1 − 2 c i ) γ i , λ R = X i c i γ i , 2 c i = 1 − ω 20 i ω 20 , ω 2 = ω 20 ( 33 ) In this limit , it is easy to generalize our results for the diagonal correlators and write down expressions for all the orientational correlation functions : h t i ( s 1 ) t j ( s 2 ) i = ω 0 i ω 0 j ω 20 e − λ 1 s + δ ij − ω 0 i ω 0 j ω 20 ! cos ( ω 0 s ) e − λ R s − X k ε ijk ω 0 k ω 0 sin ( ω 0 s ) e − λ R s ( 34 ) 9 where s = s 1 − s 2 > 0 . As expected , Eq . ( 34 ) satisﬁes the condition of orthonormality of triad vectors t i ( s 1 ) t j ( s 1 ) = δ ij ( this geometric condition must be satisﬁed for the instantaneous triad vectors , not only on the average ) . Note that in the limit of weak ﬂuctuations the local helical structure is preserved on contour distances s < λ − 1 R and the period of rotation of the helix about its axis is given by its spontaneous value , 2 πω − 1 0 . Using Eqs . ( 25 ) – ( 28 ) it can be shown that when ∆ → 0 , the total curvature of the helix vanishes as ω ∼ ∆ 1 / 2 . Since ω is positive for ∆ > 0 and vanishes for ∆ ≤ 0 , in a loose sense it plays the role of an order parameter associated with helical order , and the point ∆ = 0 can be interpreted as the critical point at which a continuous helix to random coil transition takes place . However , although the dependence of ω on the various parameters exhibits surprisingly rich behavior , the investigation of the transition region is of limited physical signiﬁcance . The change of the helical period from 2 πω − 1 0 to inﬁnity takes place in the “overdamped” regime where this period is larger than the persistence length ( ω ≤ γ ) , and local helical structure can no longer be deﬁned in a statistically signiﬁcant sense . An approximate but more physically meaningful criterion for the “melting” transition is that a helix of period 2 πω − 1 melts when the persistence length becomes of order of this period . We now return to Eq . ( 22 ) for the persistence length . Using the matrix equation R ∞ 0 ds exp ( − Λ s ) = Λ − 1 and taking the appropriate matrix element we ﬁnd : l p = 2 τ 20 + γ 1 γ 2 κ 20 (cid:16) γ 1 cos 2 α 0 + γ 2 sin 2 α 0 (cid:17) + ( τ 20 + γ 1 γ 2 ) γ 3 ( 35 ) The above expression diverges in the limit of a rigid helix γ i → 0 in which ﬂuctuations have a negligible eﬀect on the helix . Non – monotonic behavior is observed for “plate – like” helices , with large radius to pitch ratio , κ 0 / τ 0 . When no thermal ﬂuctuations are present ( γ i → 0 ) , the eﬀective persistence length approaches zero . Weak thermal ﬂuctuations “inﬂate” the helix by releasing stored length ( by a mechanism similar to the stretching of the “slinky” toy spring ) and increase the persistence length . Eventually , in the limit of strong ﬂuctuations , the persistence length vanishes again ( as γ − 1 3 ) because of the complete randomization of the ﬁlament . Note that the sensitivity to the ( constant ) angle of twist increases with radius to 10 pitch ratio . In the opposite limit of “rod – like” helices κ 0 → 0 , the eﬀective persistence length ap - proaches 2 / γ 3 and therefore depends on a 1 and a 2 only and not on τ 0 and a 3 which describe the twist of the cross – section about the centerline . This agrees with the expectation that since straight inextensible rods do not have stored length , their end – to – end distance and persistence length are determined by random bending and torsion ( writhe ) ﬂuctuations only and are independent of twist . B . Weak Fluctuations : The Rod – Like Chain Model From the discussion in the preceding section we expect that in the presence of weak thermal ﬂuctuations , the ﬁlament will maintain its helical structure locally and that ﬂuctuations will only aﬀect its large scale conformation by introducing random bending and torsion of the helical axis , as well as random rotation of the ﬁlament about this axis . We now rederive the expressions for the correlators , Eq . ( 34 ) , using a diﬀerent approach that relates our work to that of previous investigators 20 and , in the process , leads to important insights about the nature of the long wavelength ﬂuctuations that dominate the spectrum of ﬂuctuations in this regime . Note that in the absence of thermal ﬂuctuations , γ i = 0 , the triad vectors t i attached to the helix can be expressed in terms of the space – ﬁxed orthonormal triad { e } of vectors e i , where e 3 is oriented along the long axis of the helix and e 1 and e 2 lie in the plane normal to it ( Fig . 2 ) . It is convenient to introduce the Euler angles φ 0 ( s ) = ω 0 s , θ 0 = arctan ( κ 0 / τ 0 ) and α 0 in terms of which the relation between the two frames is given by t R ( s ) = R 3 ( α 0 ) R 2 ( − θ 0 ) R 3 [ φ 0 ( s ) ] e , ( 36 ) where the rotation matrix 11 R 3 ( φ 0 ) =   cos φ 0 sin φ 0 0 − sin φ 0 cos φ 0 0 0 0 1   ( 37 ) describes rotation by angle φ 0 ( s ) with respect to the e 3 axis . The matrix R 2 ( − θ 0 ) =   cos θ 0 0 − sin θ 0 0 1 0 sin θ 0 0 cos θ 0   ( 38 ) gives the rotation by angle − θ 0 with respect to the e ′ 2 axis ( e ′ 2 = R 3 [ φ 0 ( s ) ] e 2 ) , and R 3 ( α 0 ) is a rotation by angle α 0 about the e ′ 3 axis ( e ′ 3 = R 2 ( − θ 0 ) e 3 ) . Note that while the space – ﬁxed e was taken as a conventional right – handed triad , we chose the helix – ﬁxed t as a left – handed triad . Although this choice does not aﬀect our previous results , it does aﬀect the geometric relation between the two coordinate systems and , for consistency , we replaced the left – handed t by the right – handed one , t R = ( − t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ) , in Eq . ( 36 ) . In the presence of weak thermal ﬂuctuations , the axis of the helix slowly bends and rotates in space , resulting in rotation of the triad { e } . Since with each point s on the helix we can associate its projection σ = τ 0 s / ω 0 ( 39 ) on the long axis of the helix ( see Fig . 2 ) , the rotation of the triad { e } as one moves along this axis is given by the generalized Frenet equations , d e 1 dσ = ̟ 2 e 3 − ̟ 3 e 2 , d e 2 dσ = − ̟ 1 e 3 + ̟ 3 e 1 , d e 3 dσ = ̟ 1 e 2 − ̟ 2 e 1 ( 40 ) The generalized torsions , ̟ i ( s ) , are Gaussian random variables determined by the conditions h ̟ i ( σ ) i = 0 , h ̟ i ( σ ) ̟ j ( σ ′ ) i = ¯ a − 1 i δ ij δ ( σ − σ ′ ) ( 41 ) where the constants ¯ a i should be determined by the requirement that the resulting expres - sions for the correlators ( the averages of the elements of the rotation matrix ) coincide with these in Eq . ( 34 ) . A calculation similar to that in the previous section yields the correlators 12 h e i ( σ ) e j ( σ ′ ) i = δ ij exp ( − ¯ γ i | σ − σ ′ | ) , ( 42 ) where , analogously to Eq . ( 20 ) , we have ¯ γ i = X k 1 2¯ a k − 1 2¯ a i ( 43 ) Using Eqs . ( 36 ) , the correlators of the original triad { t } can be expressed in terms of the correlators of the { e } triad . Comparing the results with Eq . ( 34 ) , gives ¯ a − 1 1 = ¯ a − 1 2 = X i γ i ω 20 i ω 0 τ 0 , ¯ a − 1 3 = X i 1 a i ω 20 i ω 0 τ 0 ( 44 ) where the equality ¯ a 1 = ¯ a 2 is the consequence of symmetry under rotation in the ( e 1 , e 2 ) plane . The correlators ( 41 ) can be derived from an eﬀective free energy which describes the long wavelength ﬂuctuations of the helical ﬁlament , on length scales larger than the period of the helix ω − 1 0 . U LWel = kT 2 Z dσ h ¯ a 1 (cid:16) ̟ 21 + ̟ 22 (cid:17) + ¯ a 3 ̟ 23 i ( 45 ) This expression coincides with the elastic energy of a rod – like chain ( RLC ) introduced by Bouchiat and Mezard 20 . The persistence length ¯ a 1 describes the elastic response to bending and torsion of the eﬀective rod – like ﬁlament . The persistence length ¯ a 3 controls the elastic response of the RLC to twist about its axis . As a consequence of the ﬂuctuation – dissipation theorem , it also determines the amplitude of ﬂuctuations ∆ φ of the angle φ ( σ ) = ω 20 σ / τ 0 + ∆ φ ( σ ) , where the correlator of the random angle of rotation about the axis of the RLC is given by D [ ∆ φ ( σ ) − ∆ φ ( σ ′ ) ] 2 E = ¯ a − 1 3 | σ − σ ′ | ( 46 ) In Eq . ( 44 ) we calculated the eﬀective persistence lengths of this model ( ¯ a i ) in terms of the bare parameters of the underlying helical ﬁlament . In reference 20 where the analysis begins with the RLC model , these corresponding persistence lengths were introduced by 13 hand . The diﬀerence between the two models becomes important if one considers the com - bined application of extension and twist : while such a coupling appears trivially in models of stretched helical ﬁlaments 25 , twist has no eﬀect on the extension in the RLC model 20 , in contradiction with experimental observations 8 . Our analysis underscores the fact that the RLC model does not give a complete description of the ﬂuctuating helix . Rather , it describes long wavelength ﬂuctuations of the “phantom” axes { e i } which , by themselves , contain no information about the local helical structure of the ﬁlament . In order to recover this information and construct the correlators of the original helix h t i ( s 1 ) t i ( s 2 ) i , one has to go beyond the RLC model and reconstruct the local helical geometry using the relation between e i and the helix – ﬁxed axes t i , Eqs . ( 36 ) . In deriving the expressions for the correlators h t i ( s ) t j ( 0 ) i in terms of the correlators of the RLC model , we did not take into account the possibility of ﬂuctuations of the twist angle of the cross – section of the helix about its centerline , α 0 → α ( s ) = α 0 + ∆ α ( s ) . From the fact that the resulting correlators coincide with the exact expressions , Eq . ( 34 ) , we conclude that such ﬂuctuations do not contribute to the correlators . This surprising result follows from the fact that in the weak ﬂuctuation regime , the statistical properties of the helix are completely determined by the low energy part of the ﬂuctuation spectrum . Such long – wavelength ﬂuctuation modes ( Goldstone modes ) lead to the loss of helical correlations on length scales larger than all the natural length scales of the helix ( s ≥ γ − 1 ≫ ω − 1 0 ) . These Goldstone modes are associated with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries and correspond to bending ( ̟ 1 and ̟ 2 ) and twist ( ̟ 3 ) modes of the RLC . It is important to emphasize that these modes correspond to diﬀerent deformations of the centerline of the helix and not to twist of its cross – section about this centerline . Since the elastic energy , Eq . ( 10 ) , depends on the spontaneous angle of twist of the helix about its centerline through the combinations δω 1 = κ cos α − κ 0 cos α 0 and δω 2 = κ sin α − κ 0 sin α 0 , we conclude that the energy is not invariant under global rotation of the cross – section about the centerline and that such a rotation is not a continuous symmetry of the helix . Therefore , twist ﬂuctuations of the helical cross – section are not Goldstone modes and do not contribute to the correlators 14 in the weak ﬂuctuation limit . Another interesting observation is that there is no contribution from compressional modes to the long – wavelength energy , Eq . ( 10 ) . This is surprising since the RLC is a coarse – grained representation of the helix and the latter may be expected to behave as a compressible object , with accordion – like compressional modes 21 . In order to check this point , we write down the spatial position of a point s on the helix as x ( s ) = ¯x ( σ ) + δ x ( s ) ( 47 ) where ¯x ( σ ) describes the curve spanned by the long axis of the helix and , therefore , deﬁnes the spatial position of the point σ , Eq . ( 39 ) , on the RLC contour . The deviation δ x ( s ) describes the rotation of the locally helical ﬁlament about this axis . Since the original ﬁlament is incompressible , it satisﬁes d x / ds = t 3 . From Eq . ( 36 ) we obtain an expression for t 3 which , upon substitution into the incompressibility condition and averaging over length scales { | ̟ i | − 1 } ≫ s ≫ ω − 1 0 ( much larger than the inverse total curvature of the helix but much smaller than the radii of curvature of the RLC ) , yields d ¯x ( σ ) dσ = e 3 ( σ ) ( 48 ) The fact that the long – wavelength ﬂuctuations of the helix satisfy the above incompress - ibility conditions , implies that compressional ﬂuctuations do not contribute to the long – wavelength correlators . The origin of this observation becomes clear if we recall that the energy of the helix depends on the spontaneous curvature κ 0 and torsion τ 0 and , since com - pressional modes change the local curvature and torsion , they have a gap in the energy spectrum and their energy does not vanish even in the long – wavelength limit . We conclude that similarly to twist ﬂuctuations of the helical cross – section , compressional modes are not Goldstone modes . The above deliberations have profound consequences for the elastic response of the ﬁl - ament to long – wavelength perturbations , such as tensile forces and moments applied to its ends . Using the ﬂuctuation – dissipation theorem , we conclude that as long as the deforma - tion of the ﬁlament remains small ( on scale ω − 1 0 ) , these forces and moments do not induce 15 twist of the cross – section of the helix about its centerline , and that the deformation can be completely described by the incompressible RLC model . C . Eﬀect of Spontaneous Twist We proceed to calculate the persistence length of a helix whose cross – section is twisted by an angle α 0 ( s ) = ˙ α 0 s about the centerline ( ˙ α 0 is a constant rate of twist ) . It is convenient to rewrite Eq . ( 22 ) as : l p = lim L →∞ 2 L Z L 0 ds ′ Z L − s ′ 0 ds h t 3 ( s + s ′ ) t 3 ( s ′ ) i ( 49 ) Recall that the correlator in the integrand of Eq . ( 49 ) is simply the 33 element of the averaged rotation matrix , and is therefore the solution of equation Eq . ( 15 ) , the coeﬃcients of which are the elements of the matrix Λ ( s + s ′ ) deﬁned in Eq . ( 21 ) . The diagonal elements of this matrix are constants ( γ i ) , while the non – diagonal elements are given by the expressions Λ 12 ( s + s ′ ) = − Λ 21 ( s + s ′ ) = τ 0 + ˙ α 0 , Λ 31 ( s + s ′ ) = − Λ 13 ( s + s ′ ) = κ 0 sin ( ˙ α 0 s + α 0 ) , Λ 23 ( s + s ′ ) = − Λ 32 ( s + s ′ ) = κ 0 cos ( ˙ α 0 s + α 0 ) , ( 50 ) where all the dependence on s ′ is contained in α 0 = α 0 ( s ′ ) . The correlator in Eq . ( 49 ) decays exponentially fast with s , and thus the upper limit on the integral over s can be extended to inﬁnity . Since the correlator is a periodic function of α 0 , the integration over s ′ can be replaced by that over α 0 and we obtain l p = Z 2 π 0 dα 0 π Z ∞ 0 ds h t 3 ( s ) t 3 ( s − s 1 ) i ( 51 ) In deriving the above expression we assumed that the limit L → ∞ is taken and that the total angle of twist is always large , L ˙ α 0 ≫ 2 π ( i . e . , the product L ˙ α 0 remains ﬁnite for arbitrarily small ˙ α 0 ) . This assumption will be used in the following analysis . We ﬁrst consider some limiting cases in which analytical results can be derived . In the 16 limit of vanishing twist rates , ˙ α 0 → 0 , the persistence length is obtained by averaging Eq . ( 35 ) with respect to α 0 . This yields : l p = 2 ( τ 20 + γ 2 + − γ 2 − ) q [ κ 20 γ + + ( τ 20 + γ 2 + − γ 2 − ) γ 3 ] 2 − κ 40 γ 2 − ( 52 ) where γ ± ≡ ( γ 1 ± γ 2 ) / 2 ( 53 ) with γ 1 and γ 2 deﬁned in ( 20 ) . In the limit of large twist rates , ˙ α 0 → ∞ , we can replace the denominator of Eq . ( 35 ) by its average with respect to α 0 . This yields l p = 2 (cid:16) τ 20 + γ 2 + − γ 2 − (cid:17) κ 20 γ + + ( τ 20 + γ 2 + − γ 2 − ) γ 3 ( 54 ) Finally , when γ 1 = γ 2 ( a 1 = a 2 ) , the persistence length becomes independent of twist and can be derived from either of Eqs . ( 52 ) and ( 54 ) , by substituting γ − = 0 . We now consider the case of arbitrary twist rates and ﬂuctuation amplitudes . The calculation involves the solution of linear diﬀerential equations with periodic coeﬃcients and details are given in Appendix B . We obtain : l p = 2 γ − 1 3 1 + ( Ξ − 1 ) − 1 + ( Ξ ∗ − 1 ) − 1 ( 55 ) An analytical expression for the complex function Ξ ( ˙ α 0 ) is given in Appendix B . In Fig . 3 we present a three – dimensional plot of the persistence length given in units of the helical pitch l ∗ = lω 20 / 2 πτ 0 , as a function of the dimensionless rate of twist w = 2 ω − 1 0 ˙ α 0 and of the logarithm of the bare persistence length a 1 , for a “plate – like” helix with large radius to pitch ratio κ 0 / τ 0 . Inspection of Fig . 3 shows that in the case of a circular cross – section with a 1 = a 2 = 1000 , the persistence length becomes independent of twist . With increasing asymmetry , a 1 < a 2 , a maximum appears at vanishing twist rates , accompanied by two minima at ˙ α 0 = ± ω 0 / 2 . The geometrical signiﬁcance of the locations ( ˙ α 0 = 0 , ± ω 0 / 2 ) of these resonances is underscored by the observation that in the limit of vanishing pitch , a 17 ribbon – like untwisted ( ˙ α 0 = 0 ) helix degenerates into a ring . For ˙ α 0 = ± ω 0 / 2 , the cross – section of a twisted helix rotates by ± π with each period , and in the above limit the helix degenerates into a M˝obius ring . As asymmetry increases ( a 1 ≪ a 2 ) , each extremum splits into a minimum and a maximum and eventually one obtains a dip at ˙ α 0 = 0 , accompanied by two symmetrical peaks at ˙ α 0 ≃ ± ω 0 / 2 . Note that the persistence length is a non – monotonic function of the amplitude of thermal ﬂuctuations ( i . e . , of 1 / a 1 ) : it ﬁrst slowly increases and eventually decreases rapidly with decreasing a 1 . Several two – dimensional plots of the persistence length as a function of the rate of twist , for diﬀerent combinations of the bare persistence lengths a i are shown in Fig . 4 . The detailed behavior of the persistence length depends sensitively on the choice of the parameters : for example , in the limit of weak ﬂuctuations three maxima are observed in Fig . 4 , instead of a maximum accompanied by two minima in Fig . 3 . In all cases , the locations of the extrema are determined by geometry only : ˙ α 0 = 0 , ± ω 0 / 2 . In order to demonstrate how the initial choice of the handedness of the helix breaks the symmetry between the eﬀects of under and over – twist on the persistence length , in Fig . 5 we present a three – dimensional plot of the persistence length as a function of the dimensionless rate of twist w and of the inverse radius of curvature κ 0 , for helices with radius to pitch ratios of order unity and large asymmetry of the cross – section , a 1 ≫ a 2 . Note that for κ 0 / τ 0 < 1 ( rod – like helices ) , there is a single broad maximum at ˙ α 0 = − ω 0 / 2 . Then , at κ 0 / τ 0 ≃ 1 , a central peak appears at ˙ α 0 = 0 . This peak grows much faster than the ˙ α 0 = − ω 0 / 2 peak , with increasing κ 0 / τ 0 . At yet higher values of κ 0 / τ 0 another peak appears at ˙ α 0 = ω 0 / 2 and eventually the amplitudes of the two M˝obius side – peaks become equal ( and much smaller than the amplitude of the ˙ α 0 = 0 peak ) in the limit of plate – like helices , κ 0 / τ 0 ≫ 1 ( see curve 1 in Fig . 4 ) . What is the origin of the M˝obius resonances observed in Figs . 3 – 5 ? Recall that the cal - culation of the persistence length of a twisted helix involves the solution of linear diﬀerential equations with periodic coeﬃcients ( Eqs . ( 65 ) in Appendix B ) . These equations were de - rived from linear diﬀerential equations with periodic coeﬃcients and multiplicative random 18 noise , Eqs . ( 3 ) and Eqs . ( 6 ) , which are known to lead to stochastic resonances 27 . Some physical intuition can be derived from the following argument . While the persistence length is a property of the space curve described by the Frenet triad , the microscopic Brownian motion of the ﬁlament arises as the result of random forces that act on its cross – section and therefore are given in the frame associated with the principal axes of the ﬁlament . Since the two frames are related by a rotation of the cross – section by an angle α 0 ( s ) , the random force in the Frenet frame is modulated by linear combinations of sin α 0 ( s ) and cos α 0 ( s ) . This gives a deterministic contribution to the persistence length which , to lowest order in the force , is proportional to the mean square amplitude of the random force and therefore varies sinusoidally with ± 2 α 0 ( s ) . The M˝obius resonances occur whenever the total curvature of the helix ω 0 coincides with the rate of variation of this deterministic contribution of the random force , ± 2 ˙ α 0 . 4 . Discussion In this work we studied the statistical mechanics of thermally ﬂuctuating elastic ﬁlaments with arbitrary spontaneous curvature and twist . We constructed the equations for the orientational correlation functions and for the persistence length of such ﬁlaments . We would like to stress that our theory describes arbitrarily large deviations of a long ﬁlament from its equilibrium shape ; the only limitation is that ﬂuctuations are small on microscopic length scales , of the order of the thickness of the ﬁlament . Furthermore , since the equilibrium shape and the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlaments are completely described by the set of spontaneous torsions { ω 0 k } and its ﬂuctuations { δω k } respectively , our theory is set up in the language of intrinsic geometry of the space curves . All the interesting statistical information is contained in the correlators of the triad vectors { t } which can be expressed in terms of the known correlators of the ﬂuctuations { δω k } , using the Frenet equations . Since these equations describe pure rotation of the triad vectors , this has the advantage that ﬂuctuations of the torsions introduce only random rotations of the vectors of the triad , and preserve their unit 19 norm . The use of intrinsic geometry automatically ensures that the inextensibility constraint is not violated in the process of thermal ﬂuctuations and therefore does not even have to be considered explicitly in our approach . We would like to remind the readers that the formidable mathematical diﬃculties associated with attempts to introduce this constraint , have hindered the development of persistent chain type models in the past and led to the introduction of the mean spherical approximation in which the constraint is enforced only on the average , and to perturbative expansions about the straight rod limit . The general formalism was then applied to helical ﬁlaments both with and without twist of the cross – section about the centerline . In the latter case we found that weak thermal ﬂuctuations are dominated by long wavelength Goldstone modes that correspond to bending and twist of the coarse – grained ﬁlament ( the rod – like chain ) . Such ﬂuctuations distort the helix on length scales much larger than its natural period but do not aﬀect its local structure and , in particular , do not change the angle of twist of the cross – section about the centerline . Strong thermal ﬂuctuations lead to melting of the helix , accompanied by complete loss of local helical structure . Depending on the parameters of the helix , the persistence length is a non – monotonic function of the strength of thermal ﬂuctuations , and may ﬁrst increase and then decrease as the amplitude of ﬂuctuations is increased . Resonant peaks and dips in plots of the persistence length versus the spontaneous rate of twist are observed both for small twist rates and for rates equal to half the total curvature of the helix , phenomena which bear some formal similarity to stochastic resonances . There are several possible directions in which the present work can be extended . We did not consider here the eﬀects of excluded volume and other non – elastic interactions , on the statistical properties of ﬂuctuating ﬁlaments . Such an analysis requires the introduction of a ﬁeld theoretical description of the ﬁlaments 28 . While this approach is interesting in its own right , we expect that the excluded volume exponent for the scaling of the end – to – end distance of a single ﬁlament will be identical to that of a Gaussian polymer chain ( self – avoiding random walk ) . However , new eﬀects related to liquid crystalline ordering are expected in dense phases of such ﬁlaments . Another possible extension of the model relates 20 to the elasticity of random heteropolymers , with quenched distribution of elastic constants and / or spontaneous torsions 29 . A natural application of our theory involves the modeling of mechanical properties and conformational statistics of chiral biomolecules such as DNA and RNA . The advantage of our theory is that it allows us to take into account , in an exact manner , the eﬀects of thermal ﬂuctuations on the persistence length and other elastic parameters of the ﬁlament . Thus , the generalization of the theory to include the eﬀect of tensile forces and torques applied to the ends of the ﬁlament , is expected to lead to new predictions for mechanical stretching experiments in the intermediate deformation regime , for tensile forces that aﬀect the global but not the local ( on length scales ≤ l p ) conformation of the ﬁlament . Measurements of the eﬀect of elongation on thermal ﬂuctuations of the molecule , can give information about its elastic constants , and help resolve long – standing questions regarding the natural curvature of DNA 30 , 31 . It is interesting to compare our expression for the persistence length to that introduced by Trifonov et al . 30 who proposed that the apparent persistence length l a of DNA depends not only on the rigidity ( dynamic persistence length l d ) , but also on the intrinsic curvature of the molecule ( static persistence length l s ) . The apparent persistence length is given in terms of the two others as 1 l a = 1 l d + 1 l s ( 56 ) Note that the philosophy of the above approach is very similar to ours – we begin with ﬁlaments which have some given intrinsic length ( spontaneous radius of curvature / torsion ) , and ﬁnd that the interplay between this length and thermal ﬂuctuations gives rise to a persistence length l p . In fact , taking for simplicity the case of a circular cross – section , a 1 = a 2 , our expression Eq . ( 35 ) , can be recast into the form of Eq . ( 56 ) , with l a = l p , l d = 2 a 1 , l s = κ − 2 0 (cid:16) γ 1 + τ 2 0 / γ 1 (cid:17) ( 57 ) Indeed , in our model , a 1 is the bare persistence length that determines the length scale on which the ﬁlament is deformed by thermal bending and torsion ﬂuctuations . Our analog of 21 the static persistence length l s depends on the spontaneous bending rate κ 0 and diverges in the case of a straight ﬁlament ( κ 0 → 0 ) , in which case l a → l d . If we make the further assumption that twist rigidity is much smaller than the bending rigidity , a 3 ≪ a 1 , the static persistence length becomes independent of the bending rigidity and depends on both the spontaneous curvature and the twist rigidity . Note , however , that the resulting κ − 2 0 dependence of l s diﬀers from the originally proposed one ( κ − 1 0 ) 30 . Another possible application of our theory involves a new way of looking into the protein folding problem . Usually , one assumes that the folded conformation of proteins is deter - mined by the interactions between the constituent amino – acids . A diﬀerent approach , more closely related to the present work , would be to reverse the common logic : instead of try - ing to understand what kind of spatial structure will result for a given primary sequence of amino – acids , one can begin with a known equilibrium shape ( native state ) and attempt to identify the parameters of an eﬀective ﬁlament ( distributions of spontaneous torsions { ω 0 i ( s ) } ) which will give rise to this three – dimensional structure 32 . Knowledge about the ﬂuctuations and the melting of proteins can then be used to determine the distribution of the bare persistence lengths { a i ( s ) } . While the question of whether such an approach can be successfully implemented in order to determine the relation between primary sequence and ternary structure remains open , our insights about the statistical properties of ﬂuctuating ﬁlaments are clearly applicable to modeling of α − helices and other elements ( e . g . , β − sheets ) of secondary structure of proteins . Appendix A : Calculation of Correlation Functions We begin with the construction of the eigenvectors of the matrix Λ , deﬁned by Eq . ( 21 ) , in the case ∆ > 0 ( see Eq . ( 28 ) ) , when there is one real eigenvalue λ 1 and two complex ones , λ R ± iω . Expanding this matrix over its eigenvectors , we get Λ ij = λ 1 ¯ u i u j + ( λ R + iω ) ¯ v i v ∗ j + ( λ R − iω ) ¯ v ∗ i v j ( 58 ) 22 where the eigenvectors u , ¯u , v , ¯v ( and the complex conjugates of the latter two , v ∗ and ¯v ∗ ) obey the orthonormality conditions 3 X i = 1 ¯ u i u i = 3 X i = 1 ¯ v i v ∗ i = 1 , 3 X i = 1 ¯ u i v i = 3 X i = 1 ¯ v i u i = 3 X i = 1 ¯ v i v i = 0 ( 59 ) Using these conditions we can exponentiate the matrix Λ h e − Λ s i ij = ¯ u i u j e − λ 1 s + ¯ v i v ∗ j e − ( λ R + iω ) s + ¯ v ∗ i v j e − ( λ R − iω ) s ( 60 ) Since we are interested only in the diagonal elements of this matrix , it is convenient to introduce the notations c i = ¯ v i v ∗ i , 3 X i = 1 c i = 1 ( 61 ) In addition , substituting s = 0 in Eq . ( 60 ) we get ¯ u i u i = 1 − c i − c ∗ i ( 62 ) In order to ﬁnd the complex coeﬃcients c i we write down expressions for diagonal elements of the matrices Λ and Λ 2 γ i = ( 1 − c i − c ∗ i ) λ 1 + c i ( λ R + iω ) + c ∗ i ( λ R − iω ) ( γ i − λ 1 ) 2 − ω 20 + ω 20 i = ( 1 − c i − c ∗ i ) λ 21 + c i ( λ R + iω ) 2 + c ∗ i ( λ R − iω ) 2 ( 63 ) Looking for the solution of these equations in the form c i = Re c i + i Im c i we get expressions for real and imaginary parts of complex parameters c i 2 Re c i = − γ 2 i + 2 ε i ( λ 1 + λ R ) + 2 λ R λ 1 + ω 2 0 − ω 2 0 i ω 2 + ( λ 1 − λ R ) 2 , 2 ω Im c i = λ 1 − γ i + 2 ( λ R − λ 1 ) Re c i ( 64 ) Appendix B : Persistence Length of Twisted Helix Since the persistence length is deﬁned by the 33 element of the averaged rotation matrix , we will consider the i 3 component of equation Eq . ( 15 ) which , using Eq . ( 13 ) , can be expressed as an equation for the corresponding correlator : dg i ds = − X l Λ il ( s + s ′ ) g l , g i ( s , s ′ ) ≡ h t i ( s + s ′ ) t 3 ( s ′ ) i ( 65 ) 23 with initial conditions g 1 ( 0 , s ′ ) = g 2 ( 0 , s ′ ) = 0 and g 3 ( 0 , s ′ ) = 1 . The matrix Λ ( s + s ′ ) was deﬁned in Eq . ( 50 ) . Note that since the only s – dependent parameter of the helix is the angle of twist , the correlators g i ( s , s ′ ) depend on s ′ only through the parameter α 0 ( s ′ ) = α 0 and , in order to simplify the notation , we will omit the second argument of these functions in the following . It is convenient to introduce the complex function f ( s ) = [ g 1 ( s ) + ig 2 ( s ) ] e − i ( ˙ α 0 s + α 0 ) ( 66 ) such that f and g 3 obey the coupled equations df ds + γ + f + γ − f ∗ e − 2 i ( ˙ α 0 s + α 0 ) = − iκ 0 g 3 + iτ 0 f , dg 3 ds + γ 3 g 3 = − iκ 0 1 2 ( f − f ∗ ) ( 67 ) Taking a Laplace transform of these equations , ˜ f ( p ) ≡ Z ∞ 0 f ( s ) e − ps ds , ˜ g 3 ( p ) ≡ Z ∞ 0 g 3 ( s ) e − ps ds ( 68 ) where p is , in general , a complex parameter , we get ( p + γ + − iτ 0 ) ˜ f ( p ) + iκ 0 ˜ g 3 ( p ) = − γ − e − 2 iα 0 ˜ f ∗ ( p + 2 i ˙ α 0 ) , ( 69 ) ( p + γ 3 ) ˜ g 3 ( p ) + iκ 0 1 2 h ˜ f ( p ) − ˜ f ∗ ( p ) i = 1 ( 70 ) In deriving these equations , we used the initial conditions , f ( 0 ) = 0 and g 3 ( 0 ) = 1 . Sub - stituting ˜ g 3 from Eq . ( 70 ) into ( 69 ) , we get a closed equation for the complex function ˜ f : " ( p + γ + − iτ 0 ) ( p + γ 3 ) + κ 20 2 # ˜ f ( p ) + iκ 0 − κ 20 2 ˜ f ∗ ( p ) + γ − ( p + γ 3 ) e − 2 iα 0 ˜ f ∗ ( p + 2 i ˙ α 0 ) = 0 ( 71 ) Note that the persistence length is determined by ˜ g 3 ( 0 ) which can be expressed through ˜ f ( 0 ) − ˜ f ∗ ( 0 ) , Eq . ( 70 ) . The latter functions can be calculated from Eq . ( 71 ) , which upon substituting p = − 2 in ˙ α 0 ( n integer ) , is recast in the standard form of diﬀerence equations , 24 a n κ 0 ˜ f ( − 2 in ˙ α 0 ) + 2 i − κ 0 ˜ f ∗ ( − 2 in ˙ α 0 ) + 2 γ − b n e − 2 iα 0 ˜ f ∗ [ − 2 i ( n − 1 ) ˙ α 0 ] = 0 ( 72 ) where we deﬁned a n = 1 + 2 [ γ + − i ( τ 0 + 2 n ˙ α 0 ) ] ( γ 3 − 2 in ˙ α 0 ) / κ 20 , b n = ( γ 3 − 2 in ˙ α 0 ) / κ 0 ( 73 ) Since the persistence length is deﬁned as the average of ˜ g 3 ( 0 ) with respect to α 0 , it is convenient to introduce dimensionless functions h n as : h n = κ 0 Z 2 π 0 dα 0 2 π e 2 inα 0 ˜ f ( − 2 in ˙ α 0 ) ( 74 ) We multiply Eq . ( 72 ) by exp ( 2 inα 0 ) and average it with respect to α 0 . Deﬁning the parameter ε = 2 γ − / κ 0 we rewrite Eq . ( 72 ) in the form a n h n + 2 iδ n 0 − h ∗− n + εb n h ∗ 1 − n = 0 ( 75 ) in which both h n and h ∗ m enter . In order to derive closed equations for the set of { h n } only , we apply complex conjugation to the above equation and change n −→ − n . This yields a ∗− n h ∗− n − 2 iδ n 0 − h n + εb n h n + 1 = 0 ( 76 ) Substituting the equations for h ∗− n and h ∗ 1 − n into ( 75 ) we ﬁnd (cid:16) a n − 1 / a ∗− n − ε 2 b n b n − 1 / a ∗ 1 − n (cid:17) h n + 2 i (cid:16) 1 − 1 / a ∗− n (cid:17) δ n 0 + 2 iεδ n 1 b n / a ∗ 1 − n + εh n + 1 b n / a ∗− n + εh n − 1 b n / a ∗ 1 − n = 0 ( 77 ) Let us ﬁrst consider the case n 6 = 0 , 1 . Introducing new variables y n by the equality h n + 1 = εy n h n we ﬁnd a n − 1 / a ∗− n − ε 2 b n b n − 1 / a ∗ 1 − n + ε 2 y n b n / a ∗− n + y − 1 n − 1 b n / a ∗ 1 − n = 0 ( 78 ) We now deﬁne A n = (cid:16) a n − 1 / a ∗− n (cid:17) a ∗ 1 − n / b n − ε 2 b n − 1 , B n = a ∗ 1 − n / a ∗− n ( 79 ) and get the following recurrence relation , valid for n = 2 , 3 , . . . 25 A n + 1 / y n − 1 + ε 2 B n y n = 0 ( 80 ) We now take n = 2 in the above equation , and solve for y 1 in terms of y 2 . Repeating this procedure ( expressing y 2 in terms of y 3 , etc . ) we can write the solution as a continued fraction y 1 = − 1 / (cid:16) A 2 − ε 2 B 2 / (cid:16) A 3 − ε 2 B 3 / ( A 4 − · · · ) (cid:17)(cid:17) ( 81 ) Now consider the case n = 1 in Eq . ( 77 ) . Using the deﬁnitions of A 1 and B 1 , Eq . ( 79 ) , it can be recast into the form : (cid:16) A 1 + ε 2 B 1 y 1 (cid:17) h 1 + 2 iε + εh 0 = 0 ( 82 ) In order to obtain a closed equation for h 0 , we return to Eq . ( 76 ) with n = 0 , a ∗ 0 h ∗ 0 − 2 i − h 0 + εb 0 h 1 = 0 ( 83 ) Eliminating h 1 from the above two equations we ﬁnd h 0 = − 2 i + Ξ h ∗ 0 ( 84 ) where , using Eq . ( 81 ) , Ξ can be represented as a continued fraction : Ξ = a ∗ 0 / (cid:16) 1 + ε 2 b 0 / (cid:16) A 1 + ε 2 B 1 y 1 (cid:17)(cid:17) ( 85 ) = a ∗ 0 / (cid:16) 1 + ε 2 b 0 / (cid:16) A 1 − ε 2 B 1 / (cid:16) A 2 − ε 2 B 2 / ( A 3 − · · · ) (cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:17) ( 86 ) The solution of Eq . ( 84 ) is : h 0 = − 2 i 1 − Ξ 1 − | Ξ | 2 ( 87 ) Recall that h 0 was deﬁned as the integral over α 0 of the function ˜ f ( 0 ) ( Eq . ( 74 ) ) which , in turn , determines the Laplace transform at p = 0 of the correlator ˜ g 3 that appears in the deﬁnition of the persistence length , Eq . ( 51 ) . Collecting the above expressions we ﬁnd : l p = Z 2 π 0 dα 0 π ˜ g 3 ( 0 ) = 2 γ 3 (cid:20) 1 − i 1 2 ( h 0 − h ∗ 0 ) (cid:21) = 2 γ − 1 3 1 + ( Ξ − 1 ) − 1 + ( Ξ ∗ − 1 ) − 1 ( 88 ) 26 Acknowledgment We would like to thank A .

Strictly speaking , this derivation applies only to straight rods but the results are appli - cable to our case as long as the radii of curvature associated with the deformations are much larger than the thickness of the rod . 27 .

However , they assumed that primary structure is parametrized 29 by binary interaction parameters between the amino acids , rather than by spontaneous torsion and elastic parameters of the protein molecule . 30 Figure captions Figure 1 : Schematic drawing of a twisted ribbon – like ﬁlament . The vectors of the physical ( t 1 , t 2 ) and the Frenet ( b , n ) triad can be brought into coincidence through rotation by angle α , about the common tangent ( t 3 ) . Figure 2 : Schematic plot of section of a ribbon – like helix . The helix – ﬁxed coordinate system t at contour point s ′ is shown . The solid line describes the associated “rod – like chain” to which the coordinate system e is attached at point σ on its contour . The points σ and σ ′ on the rod – like chain are the projections of the points s and s ′ respectively . Figure 3 : Three – dimensional plot of the persistence length l ∗ as a function of the dimen - sionless rate of twist w and of the bare persistence length a 1 ( logarithmic scale ) , for a helical ﬁlament with spontaneous curvature κ 0 = 1 , and torsion τ 0 = 0 . 01 ( in arbitrary units ) . The bare persistence lengths are a 2 = 1000 , and a 3 = 5000 . Figure 4 : Plot of the persistence length l ∗ as a function of the dimensionless rate of twist w for a helical ﬁlament with spontaneous curvature κ 0 = 1 , and torsion τ 0 = 0 . 01 ( in arbitrary units ) . The diﬀerent curves correspond to diﬀerent bare persistence lengths : ( 1 ) a 1 = 100 , a 2 = a 3 = 5000 , ( 2 ) a 1 = 1 , a 2 = a 3 = 100 , ( 3 ) a 1 = 0 . 1 , a 2 = a 3 = 10 , ( 4 ) a 1 = 0 . 01 , a 2 = a 3 = 10 . A magniﬁed view of the region of small twist rates is shown in the insert . Figure 5 : Three – dimensional plot of the persistence length l ∗ as a function of the di - mensionless rate of twist w and of the spontaneous curvature κ 0 , for a helical ﬁlament with spontaneous torsion τ 0 = 1 ( in arbitrary units ) .
