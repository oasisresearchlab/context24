These families were recruited as part of an ongoing study of the genetic basis of FSGS through referral by clinicians or through self - referral . We extracted DNA from peripheral blood , measured urine microalbumin and creatinine concentrations , and obtained clinical and family history information . We reviewed medical records , kidney biopsies , and biopsy reports when available .
