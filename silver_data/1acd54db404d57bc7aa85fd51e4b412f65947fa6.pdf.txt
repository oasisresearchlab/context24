Da 1 Introduction Cliques are highly - interconnected subgraphs ( complete graphs ) , and appear dominantly in networks which describe wide - ranging complex systems occur - ring from the level of cells to society . And , the cliques are actively investigated ∗ Corresponding author . Email address : takemoto @ kuicr . kyoto - u . ac . jp ( Kazuhiro Takemoto ) . Preprint submitted to Elsevier 3 December 2007 in recent years because of provisions of important insights to information pro - cessing , hierarchical modularity , and community structures . For instance , in gene regulatory networks , small cliques correspond to the feed - forward loop which is one of the network motifs ( 1 ) . The motifs play an important role in gene regulation ( 2 ) , and are regarded as building blocks of life . Furthermore , the cliques are a representation for clusters , communities , and groups ( 3 ; 4 ) because there are edges among persons as nodes if there are friendships , part - nerships , and etc . among the persons in social networks . Therefore , the cliques help to detect community structures ( 5 ) in social networks . Again , in protein - protein interaction networks , the cliques are powerful tools for understanding evolution of proteins and functional predictions of proteins having unknown function ( 5 ) because proteins which have same functions tend to interact . Motivated by these breakthroughs , recent eﬀorts have taken place to analyti - cally evaluate the abundance of subgraphs , including cliques , based on statisti - cal mechanics ( 6 ; 7 ) , providing excellent knowledge about the local interaction patterns ( 8 ) and the time evolution of the abundance of subgraphs including cliques ( 9 ) . These previous works focus on the local information such as the subgraph and clique abundance , and the size of the giant components led by percolation via a class of subgraphs such as the subgraph percolation ( 8 ) , the L − percolation ( 10 ) , and the clique percolations ( 11 ) . In recent years , however , it has been revealed that real - world networks are constructed by overlapping subgraphs including cliques ( 8 ; 5 ) ; thus it is important to elucidate global structures in networks consisting of cliques . For example , dynamics of a high order emerge by the combined network motifs in gene regulatory networks ( 18 ; 19 ) . In particular , the several power - law statistical properties have been empiri - cally found in real - world complex networks . One of the properties is scale - free connectivity ( 12 ) which is characterized by a power - law degree distribution P ( k ) ∼ k − γ with 2 < γ < 3 empirically found ( 13 ) . The scale - free connectiv - ity means that a few nodes ( hubs ) integrate a great number of nodes and most of the remaining nodes do not . Another of the properties is hierarchical mod - ularity which is characterized by a power - law clustering spectrum C ( k ) ∼ k − α with α ≈ 1 empirically found , and this property suggests a hierarchical struc - ture of the cliques ( 14 ; 15 ) . A clustering spectrum is deﬁned as an average clustering coeﬃcient of nodes with degree k , where the clustering coeﬃcient means the density of edges among neighbors of a node . Since these properties reﬂect a global structure of a network , it is signiﬁcant to clarify relationships between these properties and the global structures of the combined cliques . In this paper , we propose the n - clique network as a powerful tool for un - derstanding global structures of combined highly - interconnected subgraphs . Furthermore , we provide the theoretical predictions for well - known statisti - cal properties of n - clique networks embedded in a complex network using the 2 degree distribution and the clustering spectrum , and evaluate our theoret - ical predictions with numerical simulations . The theoretical predictions are established by applying the statistical method in ( 9 ) . Moreover , we discuss relationships of statistical properties which are observed between several real - world networks and their n - clique networks . 2 n - clique networks n - clique networks are represented as sets of nodes and edges which are con - tained in n - node cliques , corresponding to n - node complete graphs , embedded in an original network . Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of n - clique net - works . The original network [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] has two clique networks [ Figs . 1 ( b ) and ( c ) ] , and the clique networks are expressed as the circled black nodes with black edges . The gray nodes and edges are eliminated because the nodes and edges are aﬃliated with no cliques . Following a procedure , n - clique networks are extracted from an original network . In addition , original networks are equivalent to 2 - clique networks in the absence of isolated nodes corresponding to nodes which have no edges . In this paper , we assume that the original net - works have no isolated nodes . We utilize the algorithm based on the network motif detection ( 1 ) to ﬁnd the cliques Although ﬁnding clique abundance is computationally intractable ( NP - hard ) , enumeration of n - cliques in a given network can be done in polynomial time if n is a constant ( 16 ) . 3 Degree distribution We consider degree distributions from n - clique networks P ( k ( n ) ) . The degree distribution is deﬁned as the existence probability of nodes with degree k ( n ) which is the number of edges at a node in a n - clique network . In addition , P ( k ( 2 ) ) denotes the degree distribution P ( k ) from an original network because k ( 2 ) = k . ( a ) original network ( b ) 3 - clique network ( c ) 4 - clique network Fig . 1 .

Degree distributions of n - clique networks embedded in the BA network with N = 3 , 000 and h k i = 16 ( shifted for clarity ) . h k i means the average degree . The symbols correspond to the numerical results , and the dashed lines are theoretical predictions given by Eq . ( 3 ) . The solid lines show P ( k ) ∝ k − 3 . In order to establish a theoretical prediction on the degree distribution of n - clique networks , we propose an approximation method based on the statistical method in ( 9 ) . We assume that the clustering spectrum C ( k ) corresponds to the probability that two neighbors of a node with degree k ( ≥ 2 ) are linked . First , we consider the probability φ n ( k ) that an edge on a node with degree k is eliminated due to the extraction of n - clique networks from an original network . For simplicity , we assume that the probability of an edge to be eliminated from a node is independent from the probability of another edge to be eliminated from the same node and the probability of the same edge to be eliminated from a neighbor . This assumption is a suitable approximation in the case of random graphs ( 17 ) because the probability that there is an edge between two nodes is constant . We show that the approximation is also suitable in the case of arbitrary large - scale graphs ( networks ) for large k with numerical simulations . Here , we focus on a subset which consists a node with degree k , neighboring nodes and edges among these nodes . Then , the edge on the node with degree k belongs to (cid:16) k − 1 n − 2 (cid:17) n - cliques which are formed with the probability C ( k ) n p , where n p = ( n − 1 ) ( n − 2 ) / 2 . That is , the probability that the edge is not contained in one of (cid:16) k − 1 n − 2 (cid:17) n - cliques is [ 1 − C ( k ) n p ] . Since the edge is eliminated if the edge is contained in no n - cliques , from the assimptation of independence , the probability φ n ( k ) can be written as φ n ( k ) = { 1 − C ( k ) n p } ( k − 1 n − 2 ) . ( 1 ) Next , we characterize the conditional probability that the degree shifts from k to k ( n ) due to the extraction of n - clique networks using the probability φ n ( k ) . The conditional probability can be expressed using the bimodal formula , and 4 we have Φ n ( k ( n ) | k ) = k k ( n ) ! [ 1 − φ n ( k ) ] k ( n ) φ n ( k ) ( k − k ( n ) ) . ( 2 ) The degree distribution from an n - clique network P ( k ( n ) ) is proportional to the sum of P ( k ) Φ n ( k ( n ) | k ) for k = k ( n ) , k ( n ) + 1 , · · · , k max . Therefore , the degree distribution is ﬁnally described as P ( k ( n ) ) = N N n k max X k = k ( n ) P ( k ) Φ n ( k ( n ) | k ) , ( 3 ) where N and N n correspond to the total number of nodes in an original network and in a n - clique network , respectively . Using P ( k ) and C ( k ) , the total number of nodes in the n - clique network can be estimated by N n = N k max X k = n − 1 P ( k ) (cid:20) 1 − { 1 − C ( k ) n p } ( kn − 1 ) (cid:21) . ( 4 ) In order to conﬁrm the theoretical predictions , we performed numerical simu - lations for the Barab´asi - Albert ( BA ) network ( 20 ) , which provides power - law degree distribution ; P ( k ) ∼ k − γ with the degree exponent γ = 3 . Figure 2 shows the degree distributions of n - clique networks embedded in the BA net - work . As shown in Fig . 2 , our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the numerical results , indicating that the approximation is suitable . In addition , the diﬀerent degree distributions are observed between the n - clique networks and the original network . 4 Shift of the degree The degree at a node shifts due to the extraction n - clique networks from an original network . Here , we consider the theoretical predictions for the shifts with the statistical properties from an original network . Using the probability φ n ( k ) [ Eq . ( 1 ) ] that an edge is eliminated due to the extraction of n - clique networks , the expectation value of the degree at a node in a n - clique network can be written as k ( n ) = k [ 1 − φ n ( k ) ] . ( 5 ) The probability φ n ( k ) is dependent on the clustering spectrum C ( k ) as shown in Eq . ( 1 ) . Since it is empirically found that the spectrum follows the power 5 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 1 10 2 k ( n ) k n = 3 n = 4 Fig . 3 .

The symbols correspond to the numerical results , and the dashed lines are given by Eq . ( 5 ) . The solid lines show k ( n ) ∝ k . law in most complex networks ( 14 ) , we assume the power - law spectrum ; hence C ( k ) = C 0 k − α . Moreover , we use the feature of Napier’s number , e − c = ( 1 − c / k ) k for large k , to rewrite the probability φ n ( k ) [ Eq . ( 1 ) ] . In doing such we have φ n ( k ) = exp " − C n p 0 ( n − 2 ) ! k ζ n # , ( 6 ) where ζ n = n − n p α − 2 . ( 7 ) In particular , the probability φ n ( k ) is independent of the degree k when ζ n = 0 , and the proportional relationship between k ( n ) and k is satisﬁed . In order to conﬁrm the theoretical prediction , we performed numerical simula - tions for the BA network . Figure 3 shows the shift of the degree at a node due to the extraction of the n - clique networks . As shown in Fig . 3 , our theoretical prediction is in good agreement with the numerical results . Figure 4 shows the probability φ n ( k ) which is obtained from the extraction of n - clique networks . Assume that C ( k ) = C 0 k − α , C 0 and α are about 0 . 02 and 0 . 1 with least - square method , respectively . We give the theoretical prediction with these values . As shown in Eq . ( 6 ) , φ k declines exponentially with k , indicating that a degree of a high - degree node tends to stay . The prediction is in agreement with the numerical results . In the case of n = 4 , however , the agreements are weak in Fig . 3 and 4 . There are two reasons . One is the assumption of independence .

Table 1 Network sizes , average degrees , and characteristic exponents of the investigated real - world networks and the BA network . The exponents γ and α are extracted using the maximum likelihood estimation ( 22 ) and the analytical approximation ( 8 ) ; thus C ( k ) = C 0 / { 1 + ( k / k 0 ) α } , respectively .

As shown in Fig . 4 , the probability that an edge on the high - degree node is eliminated is very small . For this reason , real φ n ( k ) for small k tends to be smaller than Eq . ( 6 ) . Therefore , real k ( n ) tends to be larger than our theoretical prediction . Another is ﬂuctuation in clustering spectra C ( k ) . In the case of scale - free networks , the ﬂuctuation is large for small k , and is contrary small for large k because of heterogeneous connectivity . And , the probability that a n - clique is formed is described as C ( k ) n p . That is , the error increases with n p . Therefore , our theoretical prediction tends to be in weak agreement in the case of large n and small k . The clustering spectrum of the BA network is independent of the degree k ( 21 ) . That is , α ≈ 0 . According to Eq . ( 7 ) , we predict that the shifts of the degree follow the nonlinear relationship because of the nonzero ζ n ; for example , ζ 3 = 3 − 2 = 1 and ζ 4 = 4 − 2 = 2 . As shown in Fig . 3 , our prediction is in agreement with the numerical results . 7 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 P ( k ( n ) ) n = 2 ( Original ) n = 3 ( a ) Internet 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 ( b ) Metabolic n = 2 ( Original ) n = 3 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 k ( n ) ( c ) Protein interaction n = 2 ( Original ) n = 3 P ( k ( n ) ) P ( k ( n ) ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 k ( 3 ) k 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 k ( 3 ) k 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 0 10 1 k ( 3 ) k Fig . 5 .

Here , we focus on the scale - free con - nectivity which is one of the well - known power - law statistical properties and 8 is deﬁned as a power - law degree distribution , P ( k ) ∼ k − γ . In networks with scale - free connectivity , we predict that forms of the degree distributions are invariant between the 3 - clique and the original network when ζ n = 0 . This is because the proportional relationship between the degrees at nodes in the original network and in the n - clique networks , is satisﬁed under this condition . In order to verify our prediction , we investigate the degree distributions from n - clique networks embedded in several real - world networks with scale - free connectivity : the autonomous system representation of the Internet ( 23 ) , the metabolic network of Escherichia coli ( 24 ) , and the protein - protein interaction network of yeast ( 25 ) . These real - world networks have hierarchical modularity , indicating the power - law clustering spectra ; hence , C ( k ) ∼ k − α with α ≈ 1 ( 14 ) . In addition , we also consider the BA network , which does not have hi - erarchical modularity , for comparison . We summarize the networks size , the average degrees , and the exponents characterizing each network in Table 1 . The exponents α from the real - world networks with hierarchical modularity are almost one ( 14 ) ( see also Table 1 ) . Therefore , we expect that the forms of the degree distributions are invariant between the 3 - clique and the original network because ζ 3 ≈ 3 − 1 − 2 = 0 . Figure 5 shows the degree distributions of n - clique networks embedded in the real - world networks . As expected , the forms of the degree distributions are invariant between the original and the 3 - clique network because of the proportional relationship between k and k ( 3 ) ( see the insets in Fig . 5 ) . In contrast , the exponent α from the BA network is equivalent to zero ( 21 ) ( see also Table 1 ) because of there is no hierarchical modularity . Therefore we predict that the power - law degree distribution from an original network is variant due to the extraction of the 3 - clique network ( because ζ 3 = 3 − 2 = 1 ) . Figure 2 shows the degree distributions of n - clique networks embedded in BA networks . As expected , the form of the degree distribution is variant between the 3 - clique network and the original network because of the nonlinear relationship between k and k ( 3 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . 6 Discussion and conclusion In this paper , we have provided theoretical predictions using the approxima - tion method for the degree distribution of a n - clique network and the shifts of the degree due to the extraction of the n - clique network . Moreover , we per - formed numerical simulations and show that the numerical results are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions , indicating that the approximation method is suitable . 9 Furthermore , we have found that the power - law degree distributions are iden - tical between the 3 - clique and the original networks in the scale - free networks with hierarchical modularity using our theoretical predictions . We have only focused on the power - law degree distributions in this paper . However , because of the proportional relationship between k and k ( 3 ) , the converse holds for the other power - law statistical properties which are observed in real - world networks : the hierarchical modularity ( 14 ) and the assortativity ( 26 ) . We have conﬁrmed that the power - law statistical properties are invariant be - tween the 3 - clique networks and the original networks , although there is no space for the showing of the data . The invariance of the statistical properties implies that structural properties are identical between 3 - clique and original networks . In addition , from these results , we expect that the 3 - clique net - works are constructed by the same mechanisms as the original networks with hierarchical modularity . In contrast , we have found that the 3 - clique network embedded in the BA network which does not have hierarchical modularity has diﬀerent statistical properties from the original network . That is , the structural properties are diﬀerent between 3 - clique and original networks in the BA network . We believe that these results provide new insights into global structures of combined network motifs , community structures ( 5 ; 27 ) in social and bio - logical networks . In this paper , expressly , we found structural properties are identical between 3 - clique networks and original networks . This lets us expect that 3 - clique networks are constructed by the same design principles as the original networks with hierarchical modularity , and it implies that the clique networks help to understand design principles and global structures of com - bined signiﬁcant subgraphs which reﬂect community and functional modules in networks . For example , it is believed that most real - world networks are constructed by the preferential attachment ( 12 ; 13 ) . Because of a structural identity between 3 - clique networks and original networks , we expect that the clique networks are also constructed by the same preferential attachment as the original net - works . This mechanism suggests the preferential attachment of cliques ( 15 ) . Actually , it is reported that there is a preferential attachment of community in social networks ( 28 ) . In biological networks , furthermore , cliques correspond to functional modules such as network motifs . In particular , 3 - node clique , which denotes the network motifs such as the feedforward loop and so on , appears frequently . From our result , we expect that a network which consists of network motifs only is constructed by the same preferential attachment as an original network . If so , the motifs may concentrate on hubs . Actually , the concentration of motifs has been found by the network analysis ( 8 ) . 10 In this manner , we believe that we can ﬁnd new structural properties and new insights into design principles of networks via an analysis of clique networks . And , our theoretical predictions may help the analysis and its interpretation . In biological networks , especially , since it is diﬃcult to discuss network forma - tion processes because of no ancestral networks , we believe that the analysis help to understand design principles of networks . In addition , we may establish more realistic growing network models via the analysis . Acknowledgment This work was partially supported by Grant - iaZn - Aid No . 18740237 from MEXT ( JAPAN ) .
