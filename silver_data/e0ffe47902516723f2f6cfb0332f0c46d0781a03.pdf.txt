Although early - stage clinical trials have correlated expansion of circulating Treg cells with clinical response to IL - 2 treatment , detailed mechanistic data on responding Treg cell subsets are lacking . In this investigator - initiated phase - 2 clinical trial of low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) patients , we performed an in - depth study of circulating and cutaneous Treg cell subsets by imaging mass cytometry , high - parameter spectral flow cytometry , bulk and single - cell RNA sequencing with cellular indexing , and targeted serum proteomics . Low - dose IL - 2 stimulated circulating Treg cells with skin - homing properties that appeared in the skin of SLE patients in close interaction with endothelial cells , suggestive of a gatekeeper function . Analysis of surface proteins and transcriptomes detected different IL - 2 - driven Treg cell programs , including highly proliferative CD38 + HLA - DR + , activated gut - homing CD38 + , and skin - homing HLA - DR + Treg cells . These data identify distinct and functionally characteristic Treg cell subsets in human blood and skin , including the Treg cell subsets most responsive to IL - 2 immunotherapy , thus providing unprecedented insight into Treg cell biology during IL - 2 treatment .

These apparently contrasting effects are mechanistically explained by the two main configurations of the IL - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) . A dimeric , intermediate - affinity IL - 2R , consisting of IL - 2R b ( CD122 ) and IL - 2R g ( CD132 ) , is mainly expressed on effector T ( Teff ) cells and natural killer ( NK ) cells , whereas a trimeric , high - affinity IL - 2R also contains IL - 2R a ( CD25 ) and is mainly expressed on CD4 + forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 ) + Treg cells and innate lymphoid cells 5 - 7 . Due to this distinct distribution of IL - 2R , low doses of IL - 2 preferentially expand Treg cells , while high doses additionally stimulate effector T and NK cells 3 , 7 . Several clinical trials testing low - dose IL - 2 in different autoimmune diseases have confirmed preferential expansion of Treg cells in peripheral blood ; however , they did not provide an in - depth characterization of IL - 2 - induced phenotypical and functional changes of circulating and tissue Treg cells , compared to other lymphocyte subsets 8 - 11 . Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a multi - system autoimmune disease , preferentially affecting women of childbearing age . SLE can damage various organs , including the skin , joints , kidneys , and central nervous system . Secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia are also frequently observed . Due to the presence of pathognomonic autoantibodies , including antinuclear antibodies ( ANA ) , anti - double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) antibodies , and anti - Smith antibodies , SLE was considered a prototypical B cell - mediated disease 12 , 13 . However , more detailed immune phenotyping in recent years and the limited success of initial B cell - depleting biologics All rights reserved .

In particular , the discovery of a functional deficit of Treg cells in SLE defined by lower CD25 expression and a deficiency in homeostatic proliferation compared to CD4 + conventional T ( Tcon ) cells , both of which correlated with disease activity , prompted the first clinical trial to test low - dose IL - 2 for Treg cell restoration in SLE 8 , 9 . Additional trials followed , however , two recent phase - 2 randomized controlled trials did not meet their primary endpoint of clinical efficacy 9 , 17 - 20 . A reason for these outcomes could be the lack of data identifying precise Treg cell subsets , including those that proliferate most upon IL - 2 immunotherapy and migrate to target organs in SLE , thus allowing specific patient stratification 2 . By exploiting recent advances in imaging mass cytometry , spectral flow cytometry , single - cell RNA sequencing , and targeted serum proteomics , this study provides a comprehensive characterization of IL - 2 - induced immunological changes on a single - cell level in peripheral blood and skin of SLE patients , revealing multiple IL - 2 - driven Treg cell programs with distinct migrational and functional properties .

Within the investigator - initiated clinical trial Charact - IL - 2 ( ClinicalTrials . gov Identifier : NCT03312335 ) , we treated 12 female SLE patients with recombinant low - dose IL - 2 , with patients receiving 4 cycles of 5 daily injections of 1 . 5 million international units aldesleukin over 9 weeks . Skin punch biopsies and blood samples were collected and analyzed using imaging mass cytometry , high - parameter flow cytometry , bulk and single - cell RNA sequencing with cellular indexing , and targeted serum proteomics ( Fig . 1a ) . Cyclic administration of IL - 2 immunotherapy induced a pronounced expansion of CD3 + CD4 + CD127 lo FOXP3 + CD25 + Treg cells , with the Charact - IL - 2 trial reaching its predefined primary endpoint of significant Treg cell expansion between day 0 ( baseline ) and day 68 ( endpoint ) after treatment initiation ( Fig . 1b ) . IL - 2 immunotherapy both reduced disease activity , as measured with the validated clinical scores SELENA - SLEDAI , BILAG - 2004 , and Physician Global Assessment , and improved SLE - associated serum biomarkers , thus increasing complement component 3c ( C3c ) , but not C4 , and decreasing anti - dsDNA antibodies ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Furthermore , IL - 2 treatment allowed for a reduction of concomitant daily prednisone doses ( Fig . 1e ) . Clinical adverse events were generally mild and transient , with injection site reactions , flu - like symptoms , and arthralgia reported most frequently . To investigate IL - 2 - induced effects in tissular immune cells , we applied a 38 - marker imaging mass cytometry panel to characterize immune cells in skin samples obtained before ( baseline ) and 9 weeks after IL - 2 treatment ( day 68 , primary endpoint ) . Segmentation and clustering allowed clear distinction of immune cell subsets from non - immune cells , including fibroblasts , endothelial cells , epidermal cells , and smooth muscle All rights reserved .

Marker expression on clustered CD4 + memory T ( Tmem ) , Treg , CD8 + Tmem , and CD8 + CD45RA + effector memory T ( Temra ) , as well as on macrophages , conventional dendritic cells ( cDC ) , and mast cells confirmed accurate annotation ( Fig . 1g ) . Evaluating frequencies of these immune cell subsets in skin before and after IL - 2 immunotherapy revealed a significant increase of Treg cells ( Fig . 1h ) , with only minimal effects on other subsets ( Fig . 1i ) . Notably , expression of the proliferation marker Ki - 67 did not change significantly in skin - infiltrating Treg cells following IL - 2 immunotherapy compared to baseline ( Fig . 1j ) , thus lending support for improved skin homing of circulating Treg cells , rather than local expansion of skin - resident Treg cells . Interestingly , as previously reported for cDCs in mice 21 , cutaneous cDCs and macrophages increased Ki - 67 abundance after IL - 2 immunotherapy ( Fig . 1j ) . We extended our analysis by modeling cell - cell interactions , applying a connected neighborhood map ( Fig . 1k ) . This revealed increased interaction of Treg with endothelial cells after IL - 2 immunotherapy ( Fig . 1l ) , suggesting recent tissue infiltration through blood vessels , which further supported migration , and strategic positioning of Treg cells as gatekeepers . This effect was not observed for CD4 + Tmem , CD8 + Tmem , CD8 + Temra , and cDCs ( Fig . 1m ) . With the results suggesting IL - 2 promoted skin infiltration of circulating Treg cells , we analyzed skin - homing markers on circulating Treg cells . We observed selective expansion of cutaneous lymphocyte - associated antigen ( CLA ) - expressing CD45RA – Treg cells compared to CLA + CD45RA – CD8 + T and CLA + CD45RA – CD4 + FOXP3 – Tcon cells in the blood ( Fig . 1n ) . Comparison of CLA + and CLA – Treg cells revealed higher functional activation of CLA + Treg cells , including increased proliferation as evidenced by All rights reserved .

In summary , these results show clinical response of SLE patients to low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy correlates with preferential expansion of circulating Treg cells with skin - homing properties and increased frequencies of cutaneous Treg cells in close contact to endothelial cells in the skin . IL - 2 immunotherapy induces modulation of immune cells . To conduct a comprehensive immune phenotyping we applied a high - dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel that allowed for the identification of all major immune cell subsets by manual gating . As circulating immune cells constitute only a minority of all immune cells and isolated analysis of peripheral cell frequencies is sensitive to bias due to treatment - induced migration to lymphoid organs and tissues , we extended our analysis to include cell proliferation measured by Ki - 67 expression ( Fig . 2a ) . Treg cells and CD56 bright NK cells showed a pronounced increase in frequency and proliferation , whereas CD4 + Tcon , CD8 + T , and CD56 + T cells showed only moderate signs of proliferation and did not change in terms of frequency within peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) . CD56 dim NK cells decreased in frequency but showed very pronounced proliferation . A similar trend was observed for circulating B cells , where frequencies decreased while proliferation tended to increase gradually ( Fig . 2a ) . Surprisingly , ranking proliferation after the first cycle of IL - 2 immunotherapy ( day 0 vs . day 5 ) according to level of significance revealed that CD56 bright and CD56 dim NK cells were the most IL - 2 - sensitive populations , directly followed by Treg cells ( Fig . 2b ) .

This effect was less pronounced during the last treatment cycle of IL - 2 immunotherapy ( day 63 vs . day 68 ) ( Fig . 2c ) , which could be explained by progressive expansion of Treg cells suppressing the stimulation of these effector T cell populations at late time points . In recent years , progress in characterizing Treg cells has proposed populations similar to helper T cell subsets . For instance , T follicular regulatory ( Tfr ) cells have been shown to suppress Tfh cells , thus impairing germinal center reactions 22 . Similarly , Treg1 cells have been found to suppress T helper ( Th ) 1 cells 23 . Although less clear for Treg2 and Treg17 cells , it has been shown that IRF4 - dependent Treg cells inhibited Th2 - mediated responses 24 and STAT3 - dependent Treg cells suppressed Th17 responses 25 , with RORγt + Treg cells controlling intestinal inflammation 26 . Following this notion , we assessed the expansion and proliferation of these specialized subsets , which revealed selective proliferation of Tfr over Tfh cells , Treg1 over Th1 cells , and Treg2 over Th2 cells after IL - 2 treatment ( Fig . 2d ) . Whereas proliferation of Treg17 was not more pronounced than that of Th17 cells upon IL - 2 treatment , the ratio of circulating Treg17 over Th17 increased , possibly due to IL - 2 inhibiting differentiation of Th17 cells 27 . Measuring serum cytokines with targeted proteomics revealed an increase in immunosuppressive IL - 10 and soluble programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD - L1 ) ( Fig . 2e ) , with the latter having the potential of exerting regulatory properties , as previously shown in tumors 28 . We further noted , after each of the IL - 2 treatment cycles investigated , a transient increase of pro - inflammatory cytokines , including IL - 6 , tumor necrosis factor All rights reserved .

This was likely attributed to the significant but mild stimulation of effector T and NK cells by low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy ( Fig . 2b , c ) and could explain some of the observed transient adverse events , such as injection site reactions and flu - like symptoms . Conversely , IL - 17A serum levels remained stable over the course of our study . Interestingly , we saw a slight decrease in IL - 7 , likely due to an increase of the IL - 7 - dependent memory T cell pool 29 . We also observed an increase in colony - stimulating factor 1 ( CSF1 ) , suggesting an indirect effect of IL - 2 on monocyte proliferation ( Fig . 2c , e ) . To compare IL - 2 - induced transcriptional changes between Treg cells and the other main T cell subsets , we performed bulk RNA sequencing of fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) - purified CD4 + CD127 lo CD25 + Treg , CD4 + Tcon , and CD8 + T cells at baseline , after the first cycle of IL - 2 treatment ( day 5 ) , and at the primary endpoint ( day 68 ) to investigate short - term and long - term effects of IL - 2 immunotherapy . Comparing baseline to endpoint ( day 0 vs . day 68 ) , CD8 + T cells did not reveal any differentially regulated genes , and CD4 + Tcon cells only showed 2 down - and 24 upregulated genes ( Fig . 2f ) . Of the upregulated genes , PDCD5 is associated with Th1 and Th17 suppression , and CD36 can promote T cell dysfunction 30 , 31 . In contrast , Treg cells showed marked differential gene expression after the first treatment cycle , with 8 down - and 55 upregulated genes , which became even more pronounced after 9 weeks of treatment , resulting in 8 down - and 80 upregulated genes . These included genes associated with activation and suppression ( IL2RA , HLADR , IKZF4 , LRRC32 ) , cytokines and cytokine signaling ( SOCS1 , SOCS2 , IL1R1 , IFNG ) , proliferation ( CDKN2B ) , and the TNF receptor superfamily ( TNFRSF4 [ OX40 ] , TNFRSF8 [ CD30 ] , TNFRSF11A [ RANK ] , TNFRSF13C [ BAFFR ] , All rights reserved .

Two of the most significantly upregulated genes included CEACAM1 , which has been found to be upregulated by IL - 2 signals 32 , and CD300LD ( Fig . 2f ) . The latter has been described as a functional receptor for norovirus entry into mouse cells , however , its specific role in Treg cells is unclear 33 . Analysis of the hallmark gene sets in Treg cells revealed increased activation of IL - 2 – STAT5 signaling , MTORC signaling , and oxidative phosphorylation ( Fig . 2g ) , the latter driven by FOXP3 34 . To confirm suppressive activity of expanded Treg cells , we conducted Treg cell suppression assays at baseline and primary endpoint , which showed that Treg cells retained suppressive activity despite their proliferation . Overall , these data demonstrate that , following IL - 2 immunotherapy , Treg cells proliferate vigorously and maintain their suppressive capacity . Moreover , transcriptional analysis of T cell subsets suggests that low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy primarily induces transcriptional changes in Treg cells , whereas expression profiles of CD8 + T and and CD4 + Tcon cells are not or barely affected . However , even low doses of IL - 2 exert pleiotropic effects in humans , also inducing proliferation of effector - type immune cells . IL - 2 immunotherapy preferentially expands distinct Treg cell clusters . After conducting a detailed analysis of the major immune cell subsets identified by manual gating , we switched to an exploratory approach , analyzing the Treg cell compartment by unsupervised clustering . Phenograph clustering allowed identification of all major immune cell subsets , including CD4 + FOXP3 + CD127 lo CD25 + Treg cells . Further subclustering of Treg cells identified 12 clusters with distinct phenotypes ( Fig . 3a , b ) .

Before IL - 2 immunotherapy , SLE patients had less mature and less activated Treg cells compared to healthy patients . This functional deficit was corrected after IL - 2 immunotherapy , with a shift toward the activated populations on the far right ( Fig . 3c ) . When checking annotated clusters , we observed that RTE Treg cells ( cluster 6 ) showed a quantitative defect compared to healthy subjects , with slow restoration during treatment ( Fig . 3d ) . Cluster 11 , representing CD45RA hi Treg cells , increased , whereas clusters 2 and 3 , comprising CD45RA int Treg cells , decreased upon IL - 2 immunotherapy . PD - 1 hi Treg cells ( cluster 8 ) were highly enriched in SLE patients and rapidly declined to physiologic levels after treatment ; these cells could represent dysfunctional Treg cells , as PD - 1 expression can impact their suppressive function 35 . Cluster 4 , containing CD45RA lo Treg cells , showed a marked reduction upon IL - 2 treatment , which was likely due to their differentiation into the more activated Treg cell clusters 5 and 7 . Highly differentiated Treg cells were found particularly in clusters 7 ( HLA - DR + ) , 9 ( CD38 + ) , and 12 ( CD38 + HLA - DR + ) , which vigorously expanded upon IL - 2 immunotherapy . Interestingly , we identified two Treg cell subsets ( clusters 1 and 10 ) that clustered closely with RTE Treg cells , which were CD31 high , expressed low to intermediate levels of CD45RA and decreased upon IL - 2 treatment . According to previous reports these cells contain few T cell receptor excision circles and are not considered RTEs 36 . As cluster 6 , representing RTE Treg cells , suggested a progressive normalization of thymic Treg cell output upon IL - 2 treatment , we aimed to confirm this observation by using manual gating . Indeed , CD45RA + CD31 + RTE Treg cells were reduced in SLE patients compared to healthy individuals , suggesting a deficiency in thymic Treg cell All rights reserved .

IL - 2 immunotherapy induced pronounced proliferation and frequencies of RTE Treg cells increased 2 – 3 fold ( Fig . 3e ) , whereas no change was evident in CD4 + RTE Tcon cells ( Fig . 3f ) . Having identified clusters 7 , 9 , and 12 as the most IL - 2 - sensitive Treg cell subpopulations , we applied manual gating to identify these cells based on surface markers CD38 and HLA - DR . This allowed subdivision into four CD45RA – Treg cell subsets , namely CD38 – HLA - DR – Treg , CD38 + Treg , HLA - DR + Treg , and CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cells ( Fig . 3g ) . Assessment of distribution revealed that CD38 + , HLA - DR + , and CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cells constituted approximately 25 % of all CD45RA – Treg cells in both healthy subjects and SLE patients at baseline , with no notable difference between these groups . Upon IL - 2 treatment , these subsets significantly expanded to approximately 55 % , with CD38 + Treg cells expanding 1 . 5 - fold , HLA - DR + Treg cells 1 . 9 - fold , and CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cells even 3 . 8 - fold . Together , these results demonstrate differential effects of IL - 2 immunotherapy on distinct Treg cell clusters . Treg cells expressing CD38 and / or HLA - DR are the most IL - 2 - sensitive subsets . IL - 2 immunotherapy also corrects the deficiency in RTE Treg cell output in SLE . Single - cell RNA sequencing reveals functional properties of Treg cell subsets . To further elucidate the differential roles of Treg cell subsets , we performed single - cell RNA sequencing with cellular indexing of PBMCs in three SLE patients before and after IL - 2 treatment ( day 0 and day 5 ) . Primary FlowSOM clustering based on surface protein expression allowed identification of all major immune cell subsets , including Treg cells . All rights reserved .

Analysis of RNA expression distribution between the CD38 + Treg , HLA - DR + Treg , and CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cell subsets demonstrated that the majority of genes were expressed by all three subsets ( n = 3 , 325 ) , while 1 , 664 genes were uniquely expressed by only one of the subsets ( Fig . 4c ) . We performed differential analysis of protein and RNA expression between the three subsets . Hierarchical clustering of all significant surface proteins ( Fig . 4d ) and the top 50 genes ( Fig . 4e ) showed distinct activation programs by the three subsets . These included proteins and genes associated with migration ( CD62L , ITGB1 , ITGA6 , ITGB7 , CCR4 , CCR6 , CXCR3 , CCR9 ) and with activation and suppression ( ICOS , CD25 , CD39 ) ( Fig . 4d , e ) . To gain detailed insight into the distinct activation states of the CD38 + Treg , HLA - DR + Treg , and CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cell subsets , we compared surface protein expression , single - cell RNA sequencing protein abundance , and single - cell RNA sequencing mRNA expression of markers associated with migration ( Fig . 4f ) and with activation and suppression ( Fig . 4g ) . These revealed that CD38 + Treg cells expressed high levels of ITGA4 and ITGB7 together with CCR9 ( Fig . 4f ) , which are implicated in gut homing 37 , 38 . A fraction of these cells also expressed high CXCR5 and CCR7 ( Fig . 4f ) , which indicated an enrichment of Tfr cells in this subset . CD38 + Treg cells also carried proteins associated with suppression , including CTLA - 4 , LAG3 , and PD - L1 ( Fig . 4g ) 39 , 40 . Differently , HLA - DR + Treg cells displayed a skin - homing profile , with increased All rights reserved .

A part of this subset further expressed CD62L , indicating homing to secondary lymphoid organs ( Fig . 4f ) . HLA - DR + Treg cells expressed increased CD39 and TGFB1 , thus indicating a distinct suppressive profile different from the other two subsets ( Fig . 4g ) . CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cells did not show a discernible tissue - homing profile ( Fig . 4f ) , but they carried the highest expression levels of Treg cell activation - associated markers CD25 , FOXP3 , ICOS , CTLA - 4 , TIGIT , LAG3 , LAGLS9 ( coding for Galectin 9 ) , and TNFRSF9 ( coding for TRAIL ) ( Fig . 4g ) , most of which have been associated with suppression 40 . This subset was the most proliferative Treg cell subset during low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy , compared to CD38 + and HLA - DR + Treg cells . Interestingly , proliferation was absent in CD45RA – CD38 – HLA - DR – and CD45RA + Treg cells ( Fig . 4h ) . Gene set variance analysis displaying hallmark gene sets on a radar chart revealed enrichment of the glycolysis gene set in CD38 + Treg cells ( Fig . 4i ) . The IL - 2 – STAT5 and IL - 6 – JAK – STAT3 signaling gene sets were enriched in HLA - DR + Treg cells , whereas MTORC1 and interferon alpha gene sets were enriched in CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cells . This further supports distinct activation programs induced by different cytokine signals . To further investigate the plasticity of these Treg cell subsets , we FACS - purified CD45RA – CD38 – HLA - DR – Treg , CD38 + Treg , HLA - DR + Treg , and CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg subsets . Upon in vitro stimulation by IL - 2 , T cell receptor ( TCR ) engagement or IL - 2 and TCR engagement for 72 hours , the CD38 + Treg , HLA - DR + Treg , and CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg subsets maintained their respective phenotypes . In contrast , CD45RA – CD38 – HLA - DR – Treg cells upregulated HLA - DR upon IL - 2 stimulation , and CD38 upon All rights reserved .

These data suggested that CD38 and HLA - DR identified stable Treg cell subsets , whereas HLA - DR was induced by IL - 2 signals and CD38 by combined IL - 2R and TCR engagement ( Fig . 4j ) . Taken together , these results support IL - 2 - driven Treg cell subsets with distinct transcriptional programs of tissue homing and suppression . Whereas CD38 + Treg cells carry features of gut - homing cells and HLA - DR marks skin - homing Treg cells , CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cells constitute a highly activated and proliferative subset .

Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting B cell - activating factor ( BAFF ) that reduces plasma cell differentiation and survival , while anifrolumab targets the type - I interferon ( IFN ) pathway activated in SLE 41 , 42 . Despite these recent approvals , many patients insufficiently respond to current therapies , which is likely due to the heterogeneity of SLE . One interesting and complementary approach aims to correct the functional Treg cell deficiency observed in SLE by low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy . Our data confirm previous reports of pronounced Treg cell expansion by IL - 2 immunotherapy in SLE , coinciding with clinical response measured with validated clinical scores and improvement of serum biomarkers . We further demonstrated – for the first time – that low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy expanded Treg cells in a peripheral tissue , namely the skin . Interestingly , this effect appeared to be selective for Treg cells and did not affect CD4 + Tcon or CD8 + T cells . Mechanistically , IL - 2 immunotherapy did not induce significant proliferation of skin - resident Treg cells ; rather , it induced proliferation of CLA - expressing skin - homing Treg cells , which subsequently infiltrated the skin . This was further supported by the close interaction of Treg cells with vascular endothelial cells upon IL - 2 treatment , and this relationship , in turn , might position Treg cells as gatekeepers of effector T cells trying to enter the skin . It is interesting to speculate that IL - 2 - stimulated skin - homing Treg cells might become independent of IL - 2 upon skin infiltration by relying on signals by IL - 7 and other cytokines 29 , 43 .

To our knowledge , the current study provides the most comprehensive immune cell phenotyping to date of patients treated with low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy . Surprisingly , our data revealed that not Treg cells but CD56 bright NK cells were the most IL - 2 - sensitive immune cells , showing up to 60 % proliferation after IL - 2 treatment . NK cells have been reported to exert regulatory functions in multiple sclerosis patients treated with the anti - CD25 antibody daclizumab , potentially via direct cytotoxicity on autoreactive CD4 + T cells 44 , 45 . To which extent these functions also operate in SLE patients treated by IL - 2 remains unclear . Although to a lesser degree , also CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets proliferated upon IL - 2 immunotherapy . Most commonly , increased cell proliferation does not coincide with expansion in the blood , likely due to migration to secondary lymphoid organs or into the tissue . This supports our notion that human studies investigating the effects of specific immunomodulatory treatments , including stimulatory cytokines , anti - cytokine antibodies , and immune checkpoint inhibitors , should , in addition to reporting frequencies , also focus on proliferation . Furthermore , our results demonstrated that IL - 2 treatment increased blood levels of both suppressive cytokines , such as IL - 10 , and of pro - inflammatory cytokines , such as IL - 6 , TNF , and IFNγ . The increase in IFNγ could be attributed to the significant expansion of CD56 bright NK cells 45 . However , this effect was mild and transient . Detailed and unsupervised analysis of Treg cell phenotypes showed a strong IL - 2 - driven expansion of CD38 + , HLA - DR + , and CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cells . Interestingly , proliferation during steady state was limited to these three CD45RA – subsets , whereas All rights reserved .

Extended phenotyping with single - cell RNA sequencing revealed these subsets showed characteristics of suppressive function and migration to specific tissues . While CD38 + Treg cells expressed receptors associated with gut homing , HLA - DR + Treg cells expressed skin - homing receptors . On the other hand , concomitant CD38 and HLA - DR positivity marked highly proliferative Treg cells . The identification of these subsets offers a clear distinction between resting and highly activated Treg cells , the latter being fueled by IL - 2 immunotherapy . Previous results in humans suggested that HLA - DR + Treg cells were highly suppressive 46 , whereas CD38 correlated with a suppressive Treg cell phenotype in lupus - prone mice 47 . A detailed description of CD38 + HLA - DR + Treg cells and their interrelation with CD38 + and HLA - DR + Treg cells remains to be studied . Future studies should also investigate whether these subsets are impaired in different autoimmune diseases or enriched in tumors with poor outcome or resistance to immunotherapy . A first step in this direction comes from a recent study that associated poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients with tumor - infiltrating CD38 + Treg cells 48 . This finding further supports the gut - homing properties of these cells . Moreover , the identification of these cells has specific implications for novel immunotherapeutic strategies adopted from oncology . In particular , the potential benefit of depleting CD38 + long - lived plasma cells with the CD38 - targeting antibody daratumumab in SLE might be compromised by simultaneous depletion of activated CD38 + Treg cells 49 , 50 . From a clinical perspective , one limitation of this study is the lack of a control group , thus preventing clear conclusions on the clinical response in these patients .

The study also revealed limitations of low - dose IL - 2 treatment . Due to the imperfect bias toward the trimeric IL - 2R , stimulation of effector cell populations including NK and T cell subsets could limit its efficacy . Despite these effects , Treg cell expansion seems to be beneficial , which supports the clinical development of improved IL - 2 formulations with CD25 bias 51 , 52 . Furthermore , the implication and mechanism of the observed B cell proliferation remains unclear . Future in - depth studies analyzing the B cell compartment upon IL - 2 immunotherapy might reveal novel aspects of direct and indirect effects of IL - 2 on subsets of this compartment . Of particular interest could be the subset of regulatory B cells , which has been proposed to express functional IL - 2R 53 . In summary , this constitutes the first study aiming at comprehensively phenotyping IL - 2 - induced effects of low - dose IL - 2 immunotherapy . Categorizing Treg cells based on expression patterns of CD45RA , CD38 , and HLA - DR has distinct advantages compared to previous approaches that focused on gradual expression patterns of CD25 and FOXP3 . Our findings thus have important implications for the future development of improved IL - 2 treatments and the characterization of Treg cells in autoimmune diseases and cancer . All rights reserved .

Where available , pre - conjugated antibodies were used with the remaining antibodies conjugated in - house with heavy metal isotopes using the Maxpar Antibody Labeling Kit following standard protocols ( Fluidigm ) . The conjugation of antibodies against α - smooth muscle actin ( SMA ) and collagen I with cisplatin 194 and 198 were performed following an adapted published protocol 61 . Tissue sections with 5 - μm thickness were dried at room temperature , followed by fixation with 1 % paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature . After cooling in methanol for 5 min at – 20 °C , sections were incubated with the antibody mixture overnight at 4°C . The following day , sections were washed three times with staining buffer for 5 min and once with deionized water for 2 min , and subsequently air dried . Skin sections were then ablated at 200 Hz on a Helios time - of - flight mass cytometer coupled to a Hyperion Imaging System ( Fluidigm ) , performed according to standard operating procedures by Fluidigm . Single - cell segmentation was done following the Imc Segmentation Pipeline ( version 2 . 3 ) . Briefly , Ilastik ( version 1 . 3 . 3post3 ) was used for pixel classification and creation of probability maps . These were then segmented into single cells using CellProfiler ( version 4 . 2 . 1 ) . An additional step of histogram equalization ( 256 bins and kernel size 17 ) was added as the first step of image segmentation . Nuclei were segmented by two class Otsu thresholding with a thresholding correction factor of 1 . 7 . Subsequently , cell masks were generated by expanding the nuclear masks by three pixels .

Finally , libraries were quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer , pooled in a ratio of 6 : 1 : 1 : 1 ( GEX : VDJ - BCR : VDJ - TCR : ADT ) and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 system . Demultiplexed FASTQ files were preprocessed using 10x Genomics’ “cellranger multi” pipeline ( alignment to human reference genome GRCh38 ) v5 . 0 and parameter “force - cells” set to 20 , 000 . All downstream analysis was conducted in R ( version 4 . 1 . 2 ) . Quality control , demultiplexing and data integration followed the workflow described by the Seurat package ( version 4 . 1 . 1 ) 63 . Briefly , only cells with a feature count between 400 and 2 , 500 and mitochondrial content of less than 10 % were retained . After library size normalization , sample demultiplexing was done using Seurat’s HTODemux function . As an additional quality control to exclude low quality cells and cells with unknown sample ID , we used the souporcell package ( v . 2 . 0 ) and its internal pipeline to cluster single cell transcriptomes by genotypes and matched resulting souporcell cluster IDs to HTO derived patient IDs . Following this , the three runs were integrated by selecting variable features as integration anchors . For clustering - based cell type identification FlowSOM ( FlowSOM package , version 1 . 4 . 0 ) and Consensus Clustering ( ConsensusClusterPlus package , version 1 . 60 . 0 ) were used to identify main cell lineages prior to weighted nearest - neighbor clustering ( Seurat package ) to identify subclusters .
