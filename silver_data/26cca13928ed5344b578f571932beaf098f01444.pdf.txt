Introduction The COronaVIrus Disease of 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS - CoV - 2 virus was reported in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in early 2020 . It is arguably the most devastating pandemic in the last 100 years after the Spanish flu . The virus has spread globally and keeps mutating leading to new variants with uncertain disease transmission characteristics ( The Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) , 2021c ) . A number of vaccines have been developed and are being administered together with a variety of non - pharmaceutical interventions including lockdowns , border closures , gathering restrictions , social distancing , quarantining , mask mandates , business and school closures , travel restrictions and contact tracing . These interventions are intended to slow down community transmission of the disease , but have a great impact on global and regional economies ( Verikios , 2020 ; Naimoli , 2022 ) . However , despite concerted efforts by health authorities to contain the disease , COVID - 19 continues to spread and mutate . There is , therefore , a dire need for new models for determining optimal vaccination strategies that adapt to the uncertain emergence of new variants and vaccine effectiveness . This work makes an effort towards meeting that need . An important measure of community transmission of an infectious disease is the basic reproduction number 𝑅 0 , which is an epidemiology scale to measure the contagiousness of the disease . It is the the number of secondary infections caused by a primary case within a completely susceptible population in the absence of any deliberate intervention in disease transmission ( Heesterbeek and Dietz , 1996 ; Delamater et al . , 2019 ) . Essentially , the value of 𝑅 0 quantifies the transmissibility of an infectious disease at the initial stages of an epidemic and aids in understanding the course of a disease transmission and in the design of intervention strategies . In practice , it is necessary to evaluate the time - dependent variation in transmissibility under mitigation interventions and decline in susceptibility of the population ( Nishiura and Chowell , 2009 ) . This time - dependent variation is captured through the effective reproduction number 𝑅 𝑡 , which is the average number of secondary infections caused by a primary case at time 𝑡 ( Nishiura and ∗ Corresponding author Email address : ntaimo @ tamu . edu ( L .

This means that a disease outbreak is under control if 𝑅 𝑡 ≤ 1 , otherwise if 𝑅 𝑡 > 1 it means that there is an epidemic . Therefore , the goal of vaccination and other mitigation interventions is to keep 𝑅 𝑡 ≤ 1 . At the time of this study , three vaccines were authorized and recommended in the United States : Pfizer - BioNTech , Moderna , and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen ( The Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) , 2021e ) . Recent studies suggest that the authorized mRNA vaccines ( Pfizer - BioNTech and Moderna ) and the Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen are effective against the ancestral strain and Alpha variant ( Baden et al . , 2020 ; Pawlowski et al . , 2021 ) . However , just like the influenza virus , the SARS - CoV - 2 virus keeps mutating . Evidence shows that some of the new variants , such as the currently dominant Delta variant , can be more severe in terms of illness and transmissibility and the vaccines may be less efficacious ( Bernal et al . , 2021 ; Sheikh et al . , 2021 ) . With new variants expected to continue emerging , there is an urgent need for effective vaccination strategies to compete with the variant mutation and decline in vaccine efficacy . Vaccination strategies depend on various factors and have been widely studied in epidemiology . The studies include deterministic and stochastic models , computer simulation , and statistical prediction ( Scherer and McLean , 2002 ; Tanner et al . , 2008 ; Savachkin and Uribe , 2012 ; Bragazzi et al . , 2018 ) . Deterministic approaches to evaluate the impact of vaccine efficacy , susceptibility , infectivity , and population variation on mortality , cumulative incidence , and years of life lost have been attempted ( Bubar et al . , 2021 ) . The consequences in hospitalization occupancy when varying the inter - dose interval have been investigated ( Acuña - Zegarra et al . , 2021 ) . This work explores the impact of vaccination strategies under different scenarios regarding efficacy , coverage , vaccine - induced , and natural immunity . Another study involves a comparison of vaccination strategies under different hypothetical vaccine efficacy ( Matrajt et al . , 2020 ) . The above - listed works perform experiments under a wide range of scenarios in which a single parameter is varied . Other work investigate the vulnerability of variation among population subgroups and aim to find a decent balance between diversity and fairness measures ( Anahideh et al . , 2021 ) . However , the essential and conclusive epidemiological characteristics of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus , vaccine efficacy , vaccine - induced , and natural immunity remains under study , and their variations coexist ( Anderson et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , stochastic optimization models that account for multiple parameters simultaneously under a set of realizations of the random parameters are needed . Stochastic optimization models typically seek feasible vaccination strategies for all scenarios for a given objective and can thus be infeasible , i . e . , may not find a vaccination strategy that prevents an epidemic under all scenarios . Thus , models that allow for accepting a certain level of infeasibility ( risk ) are what is needed in this case . An example of such a model is a chance - constrained stochastic programming ( CC - SP ) ( Charnes and Cooper , 1959 , 1963 ; Prékopa , 1973 ) model proposed by Tanner et al . ( 2008 ) . This model determines optimal vaccination strategies to control the influenza outbreaks by allowing for infeasibility of the constraint 𝑅 𝑡 ≤ 1 at a specified level of risk . The model extends the deterministic epidemiology model of disease spread by Becker and Starczak ( 1997 ) to the stochastic setting , is based on a single community , and assumes that no one is vaccinated at the beginnng of the study . With COVID - 19 , however , this assumption is not valid because a certain percentage of the population has been vaccinated ( The Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) , 2021b ) and the model has to take this into account . In this work , we consider a heterogeneous population comprising different age groups each with its own susceptibilityandinfectivity , householdvaccinationstatus ( vaccinatedornot ) , andvirusvariantrelatedtransmissibility . Building on the work of Tanner et al . ( 2008 ) , we derive an integrated chance constraints stochastic programming ( ICC - SP ) ( Klein Haneveld , 1986 ; Klien Haneveld and van der Vlerk , 2006 ) approach for finding optimal vaccination strategies for epidemics that incorporates uncertain disease transmission characteristic and population demographics . An optimal vaccination strategy specifies the proportion of individuals in a given household - type to vaccinate in order to bring the post - vaccination reproduction number to below one . Unlike CC - SP which involves qualitative constraints and is very challenging to solve , ICC - SP provides a quantitative alternative approach . It allows to bound the expected excess ( or shortfall ) of a chance constraint by the largest acceptable amount based on the decision - maker’s level of risk averseness . Specifically , we derive a multi - community ICC - SP model to determine household - based vaccination strategies to control the outbreaks of COVID - 19 under data uncertainty and different risk levels . The new approach was implemented and tested on real data for seven neighboring counties in the United States state of Texas , one of which has the largest population and was at the center of the outbreak in 2020 . In general , a contagious disease has a higher likelihood to spread faster in a densely populated area due to the high number of social contacts ( Wang et al . , 2020 ) . The results are promising and show that the proposed approach can potentially aid in accurately determining vaccination strategies under different risk levels to quickly prioritize and stop outbreaks . In particular , the proportion to vaccinate in each county for different household sizes , vaccination status , and population demographics varies based on the risk level . The proposed stochastic model suggests to vaccinate more individuals Gong , Gujjula and Ntaimo : Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 2 of 18 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof An integrated chance constraints approach for optimal vaccination strategies than a benchmark deterministic model under all risk levels . The deterministic model is optimistic because it involves averaging scenario data which in turn suppresses extreme scenarios that require vaccinating more people . The key contributions of this work include the following : a ) a new adaptable data - driven ICC - SP methodology for determining optimal vaccination strategies to control disease outbreaks in a set of communities under data uncertainty and risk ; and b ) a computational study based on real demographic data and COVID - 19 disease transmission characteristics that were prevailing at the time of the study . The key features of this approach include capturing uncertainty disease transmission outside and within households , age - related susceptibility and infectivity , virus variant characteristics , and vaccine efficacy . The rest of this paper is organized as follows : In Section 2 we present preliminaries on stochastic programming and the theoretical contributions of this work regarding the mathematical derivation of the proposed methodology . In Section 3 we derive the multi - community ICC - SP model of disease spread and describe model parameters and population datasets used in our computational study in Section 4 . We report the results of our study and discuss findings in Section 5 . We end the paper with concluding remarks and directions for further work in Section 6 . 2 . Preliminaries and Theoretical Contributions The data - driven methodology proposed in this work is based on integrated chance constraints stochastic program - ming ( ICC - SP ) , which is derived from chance - constrained stochastic programming ( CC - SP ) . In this section , we provide preliminaries on CC - SP and ICC - SP essential to the understanding of the theoretical contributions of this work and give a detailed mathematical derivation of our generic ICC - SP model in the context of SP . We then show how to transform this generic ICC - SP model into a data - driven vaccine allocation model for disease spread by integrating into the model the fundamental equation in epidemiology that links vaccination to the reproduction number 𝑅 0 to prevent epidemics . The vaccine allocation model incorporates disease spread and vaccine data uncertainties as well as different risk levels for public health decision - making . We end this section with an overview of closely related work to show how the proposed model fits into the historical context and how it provides an advance toward data - driven models for vaccine allocation . CC - SP was initiated by Charnes and Cooper ( 1959 , 1963 ) and later pioneered by Prékopa ( 1973 ) . This field of SP deals with optimization problems involving chance constraints that can only hold in a probabilistic sense . Such constraints are common in operations research and engineering problems involving reliability or quality of service constraints that do not hold all the time . More formally , let ̃𝜔 be a discretely distributed random variable with finitely many outcomes ( scenarios ) 𝜔 ∈ Ω , each with corresponding probability of occurrence 𝑝 ( 𝜔 ) . In general , the probability distribution can be continuous but for the purposes of this work we focus on discrete distributions . Now let 𝛼 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) be a given level of acceptable risk ( or reliability ) set by the decision - maker . Then , a CC - SP model can be written as follows : Min 𝑐 ⊤ 𝑥 ( 1a ) s . t . 𝐴𝑥 ≥ 𝑏 ( 1b ) ℙ { 𝑇 ( ̃𝜔 ) 𝑥 ≤ ℎ ( ̃𝜔 ) } ≥ 𝛼 ( 1c ) 𝑥 ≥ 0 , where 𝑥 ∈ ℝ 𝑛 1 + is the decision variable vector , 𝑐 ∈ ℝ 𝑛 1 is the cost vector , 𝐴 ∈ ℝ 𝑚 1 × 𝑛 1 is a known matrix , and 𝑏 ∈ ℝ 𝑚 1 is known right hand side ( RHS ) vector . The matrix 𝑇 ( ̃𝜔 ) ∈ ℝ 𝑚 2 × 𝑛 1 is the random technology matrix and ℎ ( 𝜔 ) ∈ ℝ 𝑚 2 is the random RHS vector . The objective function ( 1a ) is linear while the set of constraints ( 1b ) are deterministic . Constraint ( 1c ) is the ( joint ) chance or probabilistic constraint which must hold ( 𝛼 ) . 100 % of the time . In practice , typical values for 𝛼 are between 0 . 9 and 1 to provide relatively high levels of risk averseness or reliability . In terms of model properties , CC - SP problem ( 1 ) is generally nonconvex due to the ( joint ) chance constraints and it is , therefore , challenging to solve . To create an equivalent version of the problem that is amenable to solution methods , we can write the deterministic equivalent problem ( DEP ) formulation . Let 𝑀 𝜔 be an appropriately sized scalar for scenario 𝜔 ∈ Ω and let 𝑒 be an appropriately dimensioned vector of ones . Define a binary decision variable 𝑧 ( 𝜔 ) as follows : 𝑧 ( 𝜔 ) = 1 if under scenario 𝜔 at least one of the inequalities in the probabilistic constraint is violated , and 𝑧 ( 𝜔 ) = 0 otherwise . Then , a DEP formulation for problem ( 1 ) can be written as follows : Min 𝑐 ⊤ 𝑥 Gong , Gujjula and Ntaimo : Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 3 of 18 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof An integrated chance constraints approach for optimal vaccination strategies s . t . 𝐴𝑥 ≥ 𝑏 𝑇 ( 𝜔 ) 𝑥 − 𝑀 𝜔 𝑒𝑧 𝜔 ≤ ℎ ( 𝜔 ) , ∀ 𝜔 ∈ Ω ( 2a ) ∑ 𝜔 ∈Ω 𝑝 ( 𝜔 ) 𝑧 𝜔 ≤ 1 − 𝛼 ( 2b ) 𝑥 ≥ 0 , 𝑧 𝜔 ∈ { 0 , 1 } , ∀ 𝜔 ∈ Ω . Constraints ( 2a ) ensures that for a given 𝜔 ∈ Ω , 𝑇 ( 𝜔 ) 𝑥 ≤ ℎ ( 𝜔 ) when 𝑧 ( 𝜔 ) = 0 , otherwise 𝑧 ( 𝜔 ) = 1 . Constraint ( 2b ) bounds the total probability of violating the ( joint ) chance constraint . This is given by ℙ { 𝑇 ( ̃𝜔 ) 𝑥 ≰ ℎ ( ̃𝜔 ) } ≤ ∑ 𝜔 ∈Ω 𝑝 ( 𝜔 ) 𝑧 ( 𝜔 ) ≤ 1 − 𝛼 . When 𝑧 ( 𝜔 ) = 1 it means that scenario 𝜔 is excluded from the CC - SP formulation . The parameter 1 − 𝛼 is the amount of risk the decision - maker is willing to take . Thus , we assume that 𝑝 ( 𝜔 ) ≤ 𝛼 , ∀ 𝜔 ∈ Ω so that the knapsack constraint ( 2b ) has a well - defined subset of scenarios that can be excluded from the formulation without exceeding the risk / reliability level of 1 − 𝛼 . Notice that problem ( 2 ) is a mixed - integer program ( MIP ) and is thus , generally difficult to solve . The CC - SP model is a qualitative risk model in the sense that a scenario 𝜔 is excluded from the model as long as 𝑧 𝜔 = 1 and constraint ( 2b ) is satisfied . In other words , the amount of constraint violation is not considered . In certain applications , however , the CC - SP approach may not be sufficient as the amount of constraint violation may significantly impact the optimal decisions . This motivated the development of ICC - SP ( Klein Haneveld , 1986 ; Klien Haneveld and van der Vlerk , 2006 ) , which is a quantitative risk approach and allows to compute the amount of constraint violation . We should note that ICC - SP has been applied to optimizing pension funds in finance ( Klein Haneveld et al . , 2010 ) . In the seminal paper by Klein Haneveld ( 1986 ) , ICC - SP was derived to quantify the amount of constraint violation formulated as a shortage to meet uncertain demand in the context of production planning . In this work , however , we adopt the ICC - SP framework for disease spread and quantify the amount of violation as an excess above a threshold in order to prevent epidemics . We shall make this clear a little later , but first , let us derive our generic ICC - SP model . Let feasible set 𝑋 ∶ = { 𝑥 ∈ ℝ 𝑛 1 + ∶ 𝐴𝑥 ≥ 𝑏 } and define the following stochastic problem : Min 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 𝑐 ⊤ 𝑥 s . t . 𝑇 ( ̃𝜔 ) 𝑥 ≤ ℎ ( ̃𝜔 ) ( 3a ) 𝑥 ≥ 0 . Problem ( 3 ) can be thought of as a scenario subproblem of CC - SP problem ( 1 ) without the probabilistic constraint . Observe that constraint ( 3a ) comprises 𝑚 2 random constraints , 𝑇 𝑖 ( ̃𝜔 ) 𝑥 ≤ ℎ 𝑖 ( ̃𝜔 ) , 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ∶ = { 1 , . . . , 𝑚 2 } , where 𝑇 𝑖 ( ̃𝜔 ) is the 𝑖 - th row of matrix 𝑇 ( ̃𝜔 ) , and ℎ 𝑖 ( ̃𝜔 ) is the 𝑖 - th component of vector ℎ ( ̃𝜔 ) . Let us now define 𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑥 , ̃𝜔 ) ∶ = 𝑇 𝑖 ( ̃𝜔 ) 𝑥 − ℎ 𝑖 ( ̃𝜔 ) , ∀ 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 , and 𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑥 , ̃𝜔 ) + ∶ = max { 0 , 𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑥 , ̃𝜔 ) } . We refer to 𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑥 , ̃𝜔 ) + as the random excess of the constraint violation . Observe that constraint ( 3a ) avoids any excess , but we know that for some scenarios this may not be possible due to the randomness of 𝑇 ( ̃𝜔 ) and ℎ ( ̃𝜔 ) . Therefore , we define a statistic we refer to as the mean excess , 𝔼 [ 𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑥 , ̃𝜔 ) + ] , which will enable constraint violation up to an acceptable level of risk set by the decision - maker . This is important because in certain applications such as vaccine allocation for preventing epidemics the amount of excess is critical . So the idea is to allow for constraint violation up to a certain amount by bounding the mean excess using a fixed risk aversion parameter 𝛼 𝑖 . This is accomplished by imposing the following ICC constraints : 𝔼 [ 𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑥 , ̃𝜔 ) + ] ≤ 𝛼 𝑖 , ∀ 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 , 𝛼 𝑖 ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ] , ( 4 ) where 𝔼 is the expectation over the sample space Ω . We are now in a position to define a DEP for our generic ICC - SP model . Let 𝑧 𝑖𝜔 represent the excess of the 𝑖 - th constraint for 𝜔 ∈ Ω . Then , we can write the DEP for ICC - SP with finite discrete distribution as follows : Min 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 𝑐 ⊤ 𝑥 s . t . 𝑇 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) 𝑥 − 𝑧 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ≤ ℎ 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) , ∀ 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ; 𝜔 ∈ Ω ( 5a ) Ω ∑ 𝜔 = 1 𝑝 ( 𝜔 ) 𝑧 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ≤ 𝛼 𝑖 , ∀ 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ( 5b ) 𝑥 ≥ 0 , 𝑧 𝑖 ( 𝜔 ) ≥ 0 , ∀ 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ; 𝜔 ∈ Ω .

In turn , the expected amount of constraint violation , i . e . , the mean excess , is computed and bounded using constraints ( 5b ) . Notice that unlike CC - SP DEP formulation ( 2 ) which is an MIP , ICC - SP DEP problem ( 5 ) is a large - scale LP . This is desirable for computational purposes , however , solving instances of the ICC - SP DEP with a large number of scenarios | Ω | is still computationally demanding . Now that we have done the derivation of our generic ICC - SP model , let us turn transform this generic model into a vaccine allocation model for preventing epidemics . To this end , we draw from the literature on epidemiology regarding the relation between vaccination and the reproduction number 𝑅 0 . In particular , we consider the last author’s early work on vaccination allocation for influenza using CC - SP ( Tanner et al . , 2008 ) . During an epidemic or pandemic , 𝑅 0 is usually estimated based the effective reproduction number 𝑅 𝑡 , which is 𝑅 𝑡 > 1 . Vaccines are designed so that an effective vaccination strategy to contain the epidemic by achieving herd immunity can achieve 𝑅 𝑡 ≤ 1 . Because in reality 𝑅 𝑡 is a random variable at best , we shall denote it by 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 ) . An effective vaccination strategy would specify the proportion of individuals based on demographics and disease that must be vaccinated to attain 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 ) ≤ 1 . The effective reproduction number after vaccination is called the post - vaccination reproduction number , denoted 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 ) for community 𝑐 . What we want is a vaccination coverage that achieves 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 ) ≤ 1 so that the herd immunity induced by vaccination in community 𝑐 is a able to prevent epidemics . To link 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 to our generic ICC - SP model ( 5 ) , observe that for certain outcomes 𝜔 of ̃𝜔 we may not achieve 𝑅 𝑉 ( ̃𝜔 ) ≤ 1 . This means that we can impose an ICC on 𝑅 𝑉 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ≤ 1 over the set of all possible scenarios . Thus , we can replace the ICC constraint set ( 4 ) in the generic ICC - SP model with 𝔼 [ 𝑅 𝑉 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) − 1 ] ≤ 𝛼 𝑐 , 𝛼 𝑐 ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ] , ( 6 ) where the random excess 𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑥 , ̃𝜔 ) + ∶ = 𝑅 𝑉 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) − 1 and 𝛼 𝑖 ∶ = 𝛼 𝑐 is the risk level for community 𝑐 . Thus , ICC ( 6 ) computes the mean excess of the post vaccination reproduction number above one . This mean excess is bounded by the amount or risk level the public health decision - maker is willing to take . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first time ICC has been integrated with an epidemiology model to provide a data - driven vaccination allocation model that incorporates data uncertainties associated the post vaccination reproduction number as well as considering the public health decision - maker’s level of risk . In the next section , we derive 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) based on the epidemiology model by Becker and Starczak ( 1997 ) that considers the the distribution of households ( size and age groups ) in each community . We expand our ICC - SP model to include vaccination status of households , disease transmission characteristics for each virus variant , and vaccine efficacy for each variant . To end this section , we provide a summary of how our methodology fits into the theoretical and historical context of closely related works in Table 1 . We list the publication , approach used , and the type of setting regarding the model or methodology . In the context of COVID - 19 , the closely related works include Acuña - Zegarra et al . ( 2021 ) , Bubar et al . ( 2021 ) , Miura et al . ( 2021 ) , and Rachaniotis et al . ( 2021 ) . These works are listed in Table 2 in terms of the publication , approach used , and whether or not the proposed model incorporates different households , heterogeneity in terms of age - specific differences in disease susceptibility and infectivity , and household vaccination status .

Multi - Community Stochastic Model of Disease Spread We consider an epidemiology model of disease spread for a heterogeneous population in terms of age under uncertainty in several model parameters , including disease transmission outside and within the household as well as vaccine efficacy . During an epidemic understanding the course of the transmission path and the likely number of infections is critical . A common approach to forecast the number of infections is to use epidemic compartmental models such as the susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered ( SEIR ) model . SEIR models can predict the number of individuals who are susceptible to infection , are exposed , are actively infected , or have recovered from infection at any given time . We consider a model of disease transmission in a community based on the work of Becker and Starczak ( 1997 ) and Tanner et al . ( 2008 ) . The later work extended the deterministic model in Becker and Starczak ( 1997 ) to the stochastic setting using CC - SP by incorporating uncertainty in disease transmission parameters . Both models consider a single community of households and assume that no one in the community is vaccinated . In this work , we build on the two works and derive a multiple - community model of disease spread that considers uncertainty not only in disease transmission , but also in vaccine efficacy . The model takes into account the vaccination status of each household in a given community . We list the mathematical notation we use in defining our multi - community ICC - SP model in Table 3 . As explained in the previous section , during an epidemic 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 ) > 1 and an optimal vaccination strategy specifies the proportion of individuals under demographic variation that must be vaccinated to achieve 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 ) ≤ 1 . Therefore , a vaccination strategy depends on the distribution of households ( size and age groups ) in each community , vaccine status of households , disease transmission characteristics for each virus variant , and vaccine efficacy for each variant . In epidemiology , vaccination coverage refers to the proportion of individuals who are vaccinated . In this work , we define an optimal vaccination strategy as one that provides the minimum vaccination coverage to ensure that 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 ) ≤ 1 . In particular , we use the post - vaccination reproduction number 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 ) which represents the effective reproduction number after vaccination in community 𝑐 . Thus , the vaccination coverage we want is one that achieves 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 ) ≤ 1 so that the herd immunity induced by vaccination is at a sufficiently high level to prevent epidemics . However , computing 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 ) is not trivial and requires several parameters , which are all uncertain at best . For a scenario 𝜔 𝑐 of ̃𝜔 𝑐 we have 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) . Consequently , instead of using a deterministic model that uses point estimates of the random parameters of the model , we devise an ICC - SP model that discrete probability distributions for the random parameters . The downside to doing this is that it might not be possible to achieve 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) ≤ 1 for certain scenarios 𝜔 𝑐 of the random parameters . This motivates us to impose an ICC on 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ≤ 1 over the set of all possible scenarios and bounding the expected amount by the value or risk level the decision - maker is willing to take as given in relation ( 6 ) . We derive 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) based on Becker and Starczak ( 1997 ) model of disease spread and consider all the model parameters as random variables . In addition , to better capture the spread within a household , we consider two levels for vaccination status for each household : 𝑘 = 0 means that no one in type 𝑛 household is vaccinated , while 𝑘 = 1 means that at least one member of the household is vaccinated . Given 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 , the proportion of type 𝑛 household with vaccination status 𝑘 in which vaccination strategy 𝑣 has been implemented , 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) can be given as follows : 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) = ∑ 𝑛 ∈ ℕ ∑ 𝑘 ∈ 𝕂 ∑ 𝑣 ∈ 𝕍 𝑎 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 , ( 7 ) where 𝑎 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) is an uncertain parameter that captures the impact of vaccination strategy 𝑣 ∈ 𝕍 in a type 𝑛 household with vaccination status 𝑘 in community 𝑐 ∈ ℂ . In deriving the ICC - SP model , we assume that significant age and vaccination status related differences in the susceptibility and infectivity of individuals exist .

Table 3 Nomenclature used to define the multi - community stochastic model differences , we define a set of age groups 𝕀 that differentiate susceptibility and infectivity by age . We denote the relative susceptibility and relative infectivity of group 𝑖 ∈ 𝕀 with vaccination status 𝑘 ∈ 𝕂 in community 𝑐 ∈ ℂ by 𝛽 𝑘𝑖𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) and 𝜆 𝑘𝑖𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) , respectively . We consider age groups , denoted 𝐴 , 𝐵 , 𝐶 , and so on , based on the disease . For our COVID - 19 computational study , we use the following three age groups : 𝐴 = ( 𝑎𝑔𝑒 ≤ 19 ) , 𝐵 = ( 20 ≤ 𝑎𝑔𝑒 ≤ 64 ) , and 𝐶 = ( 𝑎𝑔𝑒 ≥ 65 ) . These age groups were based on the available information at the time of this study but can be expanded ( refined ) as more information about age related COVID - 19 infectivity , susceptibility and vaccine efficacy becomes known . For each household of type 𝑛 , let 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) represent the total number of members in the household . Also , let 𝑝 𝑖 ( 𝑛 ) denote the number of members in group 𝑖 for type 𝑛 household , where 𝑖 ∈ { 𝐴 , 𝐵 , 𝐶 } . The possible vaccination strategies for a type 𝑛 household are represented by ( 𝑓 𝐴 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) , 𝑓 𝐵 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) , 𝑓 𝐶 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) ) , the number of household members vaccinated in group 𝐴 , 𝐵 , and 𝐶 , respectively . Table 4 gives an example illustration of household types for households sizes 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) = 1 and 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) = 2 . Given the proportion of type 𝑛 households with 𝑣 vaccinated members and 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 , 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) for community 𝑐 is given by Equation ( 7 ) . Under the assumption of heterogeneity , the explicit expression for 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) considers the age - stratified groups . In Becker and Starczak’s model , 𝑎 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) is deterministic and all the parameters are assumed to be known . On the contrary , we model 𝑎 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) as a random variable with outcome ( scenario ) 𝜔 𝑐 of ̃𝜔 𝑐 defined as the following quintuple : 𝜔 𝑐 ∶ = { 𝑚 𝑐 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) , 𝑏 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) , 𝜖 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) , 𝛽 𝑘𝑐 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) , 𝜆 𝑘𝑐 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) } . Thus 𝜔 𝑐 specifies the uncertain average contact rate outside the household , within household contact rate , vaccine efficacy , relative susceptibility , and relative infectivity . Consequently , 𝑎 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) can be defined as follows : 𝑎 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) = 𝑚 𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ℎ 𝑛𝑘𝑐 𝜇 𝑐 { ∑ 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 𝛽 𝑘𝑖𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) 𝜆 𝑘𝑖𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) [ ( 1 − 𝑏 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ) ( 𝑝 𝑖 ( 𝑛 ) − 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) 𝜖 𝑘 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ) + Gong , Gujjula and Ntaimo : Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 7 of 18 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof An integrated chance constraints approach for optimal vaccination strategies HouseholdType HouseholdSize HouseholdComposition Total Vaccination strategies Possible Vaccination strategies for a Type 𝑛 Household 𝑛 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) ( 𝑝 𝐴 ( 𝑛 ) , ( 𝑝 𝐴 ( 𝑛 ) + 1 ) + ( 𝑓 𝐴 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) , 𝑓 𝐵 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) , 𝑓 𝐶 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) ) 𝑝 𝐵 ( 𝑛 ) , ( 𝑝 𝐵 ( 𝑛 ) + 1 ) + 𝑝 𝐶 ( 𝑛 ) ) ( 𝑝 𝐶 ( 𝑛 ) + 1 ) 1 1 ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) 2 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) 2 1 ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) 2 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) 3 1 ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) 2 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) 4 2 ( 2 , 0 , 0 ) 3 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 2 , 0 , 0 ) 5 2 ( 0 , 2 , 0 ) 3 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 2 , 0 ) 6 2 ( 0 , 0 , 2 ) 3 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 0 , 2 ) 7 2 ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) 4 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) 8 2 ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) 4 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) 9 2 ( 1 , 0 , 1 ) 4 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 1 ) Table 4 Example household types and vaccination strategies under heterogeneous population for 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) = 1 and 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) = 2 𝑏 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) 𝜖 𝑘 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ( 1 − 𝜖 𝑘 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ) ] + 𝑏 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ∑ 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 ∑ 𝑟 ∈ 𝐼 𝛽 𝑘𝑖𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) 𝜆 𝑘𝑟𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ( 𝑝 𝑖 ( 𝑛 ) − 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) 𝜖 𝑘 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ) ( 𝑝 𝑖 ( 𝑟 ) − 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑛 , 𝑟 ) 𝜖 𝑘 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ) } . ( 8 ) In the absence of effective and successful treatment for optimal COVID - 19 , vaccination seems to be the most viable way to fight this epidemic . Then the goal is to have 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) = ∑ 𝑁𝑛 = 1 ∑ 𝑣 ∈ 𝕍 𝑎 𝑛𝑣𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ≤ 1 . In practice , however , there are often some extreme scenarios where the vaccines cannot prevent the epidemic . For instance , if vaccine efficacy is not sufficiently large , 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) > 1 . This means that constraint 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ≤ 1 is violated . To capture and bound the amount of violation , essentially taking risk , we use the ICC approach which allows to have some amount of violation . We denote the amount of violation by 𝑧 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) and restrict the expected violation by 𝛼 𝑐 , i . e . , 𝔼 [ 𝑧 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ] ≤ 𝛼 𝑐 . We assume that the value of 𝛼 𝑐 is set by the decision - maker ( public health authorities ) for each community . We are now ready to state the multi - community ICC - SP formulation for optimal vaccination strategies under uncertainty as follows : Min ∑ 𝑛 ∈ ℕ ∑ 𝑘 ∈ 𝕂 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) ∑ 𝑣 = 0 ∑ 𝑐 ∈ ℂ 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) ℎ 𝑛𝑘𝑐 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( 9a ) s . t ∑ 𝑛 ∈ ℕ ∑ 𝑘 ∈ 𝕂 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) ∑ 𝑣 = 0 𝑎 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( 𝜔 ) 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 − 𝑧 𝜔𝑐 ≤ 1 , ∀ 𝑐 ∈ ℂ ; ∀ 𝜔 ∈ Ω ( 9b ) ∑ 𝜔 ∈Ω 𝑝 𝜔 𝑧 𝜔𝑐 ≤ 𝛼 𝑐 , ∀ 𝑐 ∈ ℂ ( 9c ) 𝑛 ∑ 𝑣 = 0 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 = 1 , ∀ 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁 ; 𝑘 ∈ 𝕂 ; ∀ 𝑐 ∈ ℂ ( 9d ) 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 , 𝑧 𝜔𝑐 ≥ 0 , ∀ 𝑣 ∈ { 0 , ⋯ , 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) } ; 𝑛 ∈ ℕ ; 𝑘 ∈ 𝕂 ; ∀ 𝑐 ∈ ℂ ; ∀ 𝜔 ∈ Ω . ( 9e ) The objective function ( 9a ) determines the minimum vaccination coverage across communities . Constraints ( 9b ) and ( 9c ) comprises the integrated chance constraints , allowing 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) = ∑ 𝑁𝑛 = 1 ∑ 𝑣 ∈ 𝕍 𝑎 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 ≤ 1 to be violated by 𝑧 ( ̃𝜔𝑐 ) , with the expected violation 𝔼 [ 𝑧 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ] not to exceed 𝛼 𝑐 . Constraints ( 9d ) determine the proportion of persons to vaccinate for each household type in each community . Finally , constraints ( 9e ) are nonnegativity restrictions on the decision variables . 4 . Model Data and Case Study To gain insights into the ICC - SP model optimal vaccination strategies under uncertainty , we considered a case study based on a large population center in Texas , United States , involving several counties . We implemented the ICC - SP Gong , Gujjula and Ntaimo : Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 8 of 18 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof An integrated chance constraints approach for optimal vaccination strategies model using the C + + programming language and the CPLEX Callable Library and used data from several sources . In general , in a highly populated community , individuals have more frequent social interactions that can lead to a greater likelihood of an outbreak of a contagious disease . The outbreak eventually can spread to the surrounding communities if the more populated community is not under control . In the case study , we consider seven Texas counties : Travis , Williamson , Bastrop , Caldwell , Hays , Burnet , and Blanco . Travis county is the center of the outbreak with the largest population . We conducted several experiments to generate vaccination strategies for all seven counties under model uncertain parameters and different risk levels to drive the post - vaccination reproduction number 𝑅 𝐻𝑉 𝑐 to be below one . The optimal vaccination strategy prescribes the minimum proportion of a population with different vaccination status required to be vaccinated to control the outbreak in each county . The vaccination strategies suggested by the model are not only driven by uncertain parameters , but also by the population demographics in each county . The population demographics include the distribution of the household types , age compositions in a household , and vaccination status of the household members . Next , we describe the uncertain parameters and data used in the ICC - SP model . We used United States census data to capture the demographics of the communities and characterized each community in terms of the distribution of household types ( see Table 4 ) with different age groups . For the uncertain model parameters , we constructed discrete distributions based on the information available on COVID - 19 transmission , historical values for the effective reproduction number , and the advertised efficacy values for the approved vaccines at the time of this study . Below , we describe each type of data and provide the source for the data . • Demographic data : We implemented the ICC - SP model using actual population datasets for seven neighboring counties in Texas : Travis , Williamson , Bastrop , Caldwell , Hays , Burnet , and Blanco . These are listed in decreasing order of population size . The household type is a multivariate discrete distribution defined by : 1 ) the size of the household ; 2 ) the vaccination status of the household ; and 3 ) the number of household members in different age groups . We considered household types to range from one to seven ( according to the United States census data ) with different vaccination status and age group compositions . In the census data , there is a category for large dwelling but not specifically nursing homes , which are generally well vaccinated . Therefore , this data does not include nursing homes . The distribution of household types and age group composition were downloaded from 5 - year American Survey data ( https : / / data . census . gov / cedsci / ) for years 2014 - 2018 ( Bureau , 2018 ) and from IPUMS ( https : / / usa . ipums . org / usa / ) ( Ruggles et al . , 2020 ) . The heat maps that depict the data are shown in Figure 1 . From sampled data , IPUMS ( https : / / www . ipums . org / ) provides the weights of each household type with age group composition , and using the weights , the household types with age group composition are scaled up to represent the household type distribution . Out of the seven counties , age group composition distribution was only available for Travis , Williamson , and Hays from IPUMS . Therefore , we assumed similar age group composition for the remaining counties . As for the distribution of household vaccination status , there was no explicit database available and we estimated the distribution using the overall proportion of the population vaccinated in Texas under different age groups ( Springfield News Leader , 2021 ) . Detailed demographic distribution data utilized in the experiments is provided in Supplementary File 1 . • Household transmission rate 𝑏 ( ̃𝜔 ) : Household transmission rate is a quantitative parameter that measures how contagious the disease is within a household in a community 𝑐 . In some studies , this parameter is referred to as household secondary attack rate or SAR . The value of SAR , i . e . , 𝑏 ( ̃𝜔 ) , is between 0 and 1 . It represents the probability that an infection occurs among susceptible people within a household . In the extreme case , 𝑏 ( ̃𝜔 ) = 0 corresponds to no disease being transmitted within the household , while 𝑏 ( ̃𝜔 ) = 1 means all members within the household are infected ( Becker and Starczak , 1997 ) . In our model , we assume that members in the same household are highly likely to be infected by the same virus variant . Therefore , the distribution of household transmission rate depends on the variant . At the time of this case study , three notable COVID - 19 variants were actively circulating in the United States : Alpha , Gamma , and Delta ( The Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) , 2021a ) , while the Omicron variant had just been discovered . A cross - sectional study on SAR in households after the Alpha variant became dominant in Japan was performed and the value of Alpha SAR was estimated to be 38 . 7 % ( Tanaka et al . , 2021 ) . Several studies have shown the potential increase in household transmission rate with Delta and Gamma variants compared to Alpha ( Brown et al . , 2021 ) . Regarding the current dominating Delta variant , it is estimated to be 1 . 66 times more transmissible than the Alpha variant . Based on the values in the literature , we generated a discrete distribution for the within household transmission rate 𝑏 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) .

A total of 370 million doses were administered , in which 54 % were administered by August with Pfizer - BioNTech , 38 % with Moderna , and the rest 8 % with Johnson & Johnson ( The Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) , 2021d ) . According to several studies , vaccine efficacy 𝜖 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) varies based on the COVID - 19 variant . Pfizer - BioTech shows high effectiveness , 88 % - 94 % against Alpha variant ( Charmet et al . , 2021 ; Lopez Bernal et al . , 2021 ) , with a reduction of 5 % towards Gamma and 10 % towards Delta variants . For the Moderna vaccine , the efficacy is estimated to be around 90 % against Alpha variant , and 89 % against Delta variant ( Baden et al . , 2020 ) . The studies regarding the efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine towards different variants are very few . We used the overall vaccine efficacy presented by Lopez Bernal et al . ( 2021 ) to substitute for Johnson & Johnson . Based on these estimates from the literature , we generated vaccine efficacy distribution for households with vaccination status 𝑘 = 0 , which is provided in Supplementary File 1 .

Relative susceptibility captures the variation in susceptibility due to the differences in social mixing and biological susceptibility among individuals . Several studies suggest that there is an increase in susceptibility with age for those who are not vaccinated ( Davies et al . , 2020 ; Hu et al . , 2021 ; Viner et al . , 2021 ) . One study estimates that that the susceptibility of children ( under 20 years old ) is 43 % ( 95 % CI : [ 31 % , 55 % ] ) of the susceptibility of adults ( Dattner et al . , 2021 ) . Due to the vaccine - induced immunity , the fully vaccinated individuals are less likely to be infected , in return , their susceptibility is relatively lower than those who are not vaccinated . Table 6 shows the relatively susceptibility of the three age groups for each level of vaccination status . • Relative infectivity 𝜆 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) : Relative infectivity captures the variation in infectiousness between infected indi - viduals due to the differences in social mixing and biological infectivity between individuals . At the time of writing this paper , studies showed that younger age ( ≤ 20 years ) was associated with increased infectivity for populations that were not vaccinated . The infectivity of children was estimated to be 63 % ( 95 % CI : [ 37 % , 88 % ] ) relative to that of adults Dattner et al . ( 2021 ) . One study statistically synthesized multiple data streams and showed that individuals under the age of 60 are 2 . 78 ( 95 % CI : [ 2 . 10 , 4 . 22 ] ) times more infectious than the elderly ( Lau et al . , 2020 ) . This nuance is essential to the transmission of COVID - 19 because the younger population generally has more human interactions ( Prem et al . , 2017 ) and does not develop severe symptoms as compared to older populations . A member of the younger population , then , is more likely to infect a susceptible person . The relative infectivity for different age groups of a vaccinated population was not explicitly available . Several studies suggest that vaccines can reduce the symptoms but do not block the infection . Therefore , in this study we assumed that there was no significant difference in relative infectivity for the non - vaccinated group ( 𝑘 = 0 ) versus the vaccinated group ( 𝑘 = 1 ) . The relative infectivity of the three age groups for each level of vaccination status is shown in Table 6 . • Outside household close contact 𝑚 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) : In the ICC - SP model , we treat the transmission in communities as a proliferation of infected households . Under this consideration , we need to know the average number of close contacts that an infective makes with persons of other households . Close contact means being sufficient for transmitting the disease when the contact is with a susceptible person . Here , 𝑚 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) is a close contact rate . Vaccination does not affect the number of contacts . The effect of vaccination is absorbed in susceptibility and infectivity . Even though 𝑚 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) is independent of vaccination , it varies due to differences in human interactions under the impact of various mitigation measures and demographics of a community . To estimate the distribution of 𝑚 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) we used the following method : Recall that in Equation 7 , 𝑅 𝑉𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) is the effective reproduction number after vaccination . When factors related to vaccination that affect the reproduction number can be excluded from the right hand side in Equation 8 , what is left is analogous to 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) . This can be achieved by setting 𝜖 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) = 0 , and all 𝑥 𝑛𝑘𝑣𝑐 = 0 , for all 𝑛 ∈ ℕ , 𝑘 ∈ 𝕂 , 𝑣 ∈ 1 , . . . , 𝑝 ( 𝑛 , 𝑣 ) , 𝑐 ∈ ℂ . Basically , Equation 7 is reduced to 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) = ∑ 𝑛 ∈ ℕ 𝑎 𝑛𝑘 0 𝑐 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) 𝑥 𝑛𝑘 0 𝑐 . Therefore , we used 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) values and transmission rates for each variant to calculate 𝑚 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ( Locatelli et al . , 2021 ; Xia et al . , 2021 ) . The probability associated with 𝑚 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) was calculated based on the proportion of circulating variants when the value of 𝑅 𝑡 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) was observed . In other words , the probability of close contact rate 𝑚 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) is represented by the distribution of the circulating variants at the time of this study in 2020 . For example , in Travis county , the close contact rates were calculated as 2 . 0973 , 1 . 8296 , 1 . 2092 , and 1 . 6203 based on the Delta , Alpha , Gamma , and “Other " variants , respectively , with corresponding proportions ( probabilities ) of 0 . 5 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 1 , and 0 . 2 . The “Other " variant corresponds to the mix of the other variants that were in circulation or unknown . Therefore , we assigned Gong , Gujjula and Ntaimo : Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 11 of 18 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof An integrated chance constraints approach for optimal vaccination strategies Excess 𝑒 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) Travis Williamson Hays Bastrop Caldwell Burnet Blanco Expected 2 . 590 2 . 532 2 . 416 2 . 361 2 . 257 1 . 961 1 . 715 Minimum 0 . 994 0 . 926 0 . 876 0 . 829 0 . 788 0 . 712 0 . 611 Maximum 4 . 721 4 . 706 4 . 511 4 . 468 4 . 280 3 . 649 3 . 217 Table 7 Expected , minimum and maximum excess for each county when no vaccines are allocated in the future .

The distribution of the close contact rates we used for our experiments is provided in Supplementary File 1 . • Risk level 𝛼 : The acceptable risk levels are typically prescribed by public health officials based on the historical severity of the epidemic . With the parameters described in this section , we calculated the excess of effective reproduction number in each county under scenario 𝜔 when there are no vaccines in the future , denoted 𝑒 ( 𝜔 𝑐 ) . Table 7 shows the excess of the effective reproduction number , which ranges from 0 . 611 to 4 . 721 . This means that the effective reproduction number is between 1 . 611 and 5 . 721 across all scenarios . For the case study , we experimented with different risk levels to assess the sensitivity of the model to the values of the reproduction number within the given range . We report on three risk levels , termed Low , Medium and High ( see Table 8 ) . For the risk level Low , we set the acceptable expected excess to 0 . 50 % of the expected excess 𝔼 [ 𝑒 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ] when there are no vaccinations , while for the Medium and High levels , we set the acceptable excess to 0 . 75 % of 𝔼 [ 𝑒 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ] and 1 . 00 % of 𝔼 [ 𝑒 ( ̃𝜔 𝑐 ) ] , respectively . To create a benchmark for comparison purposes to the stochastic risk - averse model , we implemented a deterministic risk - neutral model of the ICC - SP model that uses the expected values of the uncertain parameters of the ICC - SP model to determine the vaccination strategies under the three risk levels . This alternative model is thus , risk - neutral , and mimics how decisions could be made in practice without considering uncertainty . The model was coded in the C + + programming language using the CPLEX Callable Library for optimization . We created and solved several instances of the deterministic and stochastic models set at the three risk levels , Low , Medium , and High . All computational experiments were conducted on an HP computer with about GHz Processor . The results are reported and discussed in the next section . 5 . Results and Discussion We begin with the comparative results of using the deterministic risk - neutral and stochastic risk - averse models to determine the proportion of the population that has to be vaccinated in each county to prevent epidemics . The results are shown in Table 9 . Several observations can be made from the table . First , we see that both models suggest vaccinating a relatively higher proportion of those that were previously unvaccinated in more populated counties . However , this is not necessarily true for those that were previously vaccinated . In this case , the proportion varies depending on how many were previously vaccinated in each county . Second , we see that within each county , both models recommend vaccinating more of the previously unvaccinated population compared to the previously vaccinated . However , we notice clear differences between the models in that the stochastic model recommends vaccinating relatively larger proportions for each of the three risk levels than the deterministic model . Under all the three risk levels , the deterministic model underestimates the proportion to vaccinate for both the previously unvaccinated and those that were vaccinated as follows : 23 . 33 % and 8 . 37 % , respectively , for Low risk ; 15 . 98 % and 5 . 52 % , respectively , for Medium risk ; and 12 . 44 % and 4 . 4 % , respectively , for High risk .

We see a relative decrease in the proportion of the population vaccinated that was not previously vaccinated with increase in the risk level for each county . However , the proportions to vaccinate of those that were previously vaccinated remain almost at the same level in each county across all risk levels . We believe this is because as the risk level increases the model has more flexibility to vaccinate less of the population and in this case , the model maintains the proportion of those that need booster shots across the risk levels to prevent epidemics . Furthermore , when the risk level is Low , i . e . , when the decision - maker is unwilling to take much risk , the model calls for vaccinating more people in each county to control the epidemic compared to when the risk level is either Medium or High . Finally , both the deterministic and stochastic models can answer other key questions of interest regarding the vaccination strategies for each county . For example , public health policy decision - makers may be interested in answers to the three following questions : 1 . What is the total proportion of the population to vaccinate in each county ? 2 . What is the proportion of the population to vaccinate in each county for each age group and vaccination status ? 3 . What is the proportion to vaccinate in each county per household size and vaccination status ? Both our deterministic and stochastic models are designed to provide answers to these questions , which we discuss in the next three subsections . 1 . Proportion of Total Population to Vaccinate The proportion of the total population to vaccinate in each county is plotted in Figure 2 . The bar graphs show the total percentage to vaccinate as well as the proportion of the vaccination status using different shades ; the lighter shade for 𝑘 = 0 and the darker shade for 𝑘 = 1 . The plots clearly show a preference for vaccinating more individuals who were previously unvaccinated for both models and all risk levels . For example , for Travis county which is the most populated , under Low risk level the model suggests vaccinating about 66 % of the total population . This is about 86 % of the population that was not previously vaccinated and 46 % of the population that was previously vaccinated and needed booster shots . The reason for this trend is due to the fact that , based on our model data , the previously unvaccinated individuals have higher relative susceptibility compared to those that were previously vaccinated . We also observe that there is a reduction in the proportion to vaccinate with decrease in population for those that have not been previously vaccinated . In contrast , however , for those that were previously vaccinated the proportion to vaccinate remains at almost the same regardless of population size . This is probably an indication that the previously vaccinated population has some level of immunity . 2 . Proportion to Vaccinate for Each Age Group and Vaccination Status The results for the proportion to vaccinate for each age group and vaccination status are plotted in Figure 3 . Recall that understanding the role of age in disease transmission and susceptibility is critical in determining the vaccination strategy . For the previously unvaccinated population , the deterministic model recommends vaccinating more of Group B , followed by Group A , which is followed by Group C . The age group vaccination preference order , in this case , is Group B - A - C . For the previously vaccinated , the model recommends Group B - C - A .

For the previously unvaccinated population , the stochastic model recommends Group B - A - C in general for all three risk levels . However , forthepreviouslyvaccinatedpopulation , themodelrecommends GroupB - A - C for Low riskand Medium risklevels , and Group B - C - A for High risk level . Note that from Table 9 , the average proportion of the previously vaccinated population that needs booster shots under the risk - neutral case ( 38 . 23 % ) is closest to that under High risk level ( 42 . 63 % ) . Thus , we see that the age group vaccination preference order Group B - C - A is the same for the deterministic model and stochastic model under High risk level . Gleaning further into the results , we observed that counties with relatively larger populations prioritize vaccinating a relatively high proportion of age Group A . This trend held true across all risk levels in general . From the census demographics data ( Figure 1 ) , we see that age Group A and Group B tend to live in relatively larger household sizes compared to age Group C . Therefore , if an individual in Group A or Group B is infected , there are more members to transmit the disease to within the household . In addition , age Groups A and Group B tend to live in the same household of size three and larger . Based on the model data we used for this study , the Group B population has a relatively higher susceptibility to the disease compared to age Group A . Thus , a member of age Group B has a relatively higher chance to be infected , compared to one in age Group A in the same household . We also see that age Group C has the lowest proportion to vaccinate in general . We believe there are two reasons for this . First , at the time of this case study , 80 % of the older population ( age ≥ 65 ) were already vaccinated and were not as susceptible as the unvaccinated group . Second , members of Group C primarily reside in smaller households of size one or two . Thus , if a member of Group C is infected , there are relatively fewer members to spread the disease to within the same household . 3 . Proportion to Vaccinate for Each Household Size and Vaccination Status Regarding the proportion to vaccinate in each household for each vaccination status , we provide plots in Figure 4 . For the previously unvaccinated , the graphs clearly show that both the deterministic and stochastic models recommend to vaccinate a relatively higher proportion for larger household sizes . However , for the previously vaccinated group , the two models offer different results . The deterministic model suggests vaccinating a relatively smaller proportion for household size two and a relatively larger proportion ( around 50 % ) for household size three to seven . On the other , the stochastic model’s recommendations depend on the level of risk with no obvious trend . For example , for Low risk level there is an increase in the proportion to vaccinate from HH2 to HH3 , then a general decrease from HH3 to HH5 , and then a general increase from HH5 to HH7 . The proportion to vaccinate in each county for different household sizes varies based on the risk level depending on the vaccination status and population demographics . Nonetheless , it is clear that the stochastic model suggests to vaccinate more individuals than the deterministic model under all risk levels . In this sense , thedeterministic model is optimisticand this is becauseaveraging suppresses the extremescenarios which require vaccinating more people . Specifically , the stochastic model vaccinates around 20 % more people than the Gong , Gujjula and Ntaimo : Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 14 of 18 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof An integrated chance constraints approach for optimal vaccination strategies 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 80 % 90 % 100 % Group A Group B Group C Group A Group B Group C status k = 1 Travis Williamson Hays Bastrop Caldwell Burnet Blanco Travis Williamson Hays Bastrop Caldwell Burnet Blanco status k = 0 Vaccination status k = 0 Vaccination status k = 1 Risk - Neutral 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 80 % 90 % 100 % Low risk Medium risk High risk Vaccination status k = 1 Travis Williamson Hays Bastrop Caldwell Burnet Blanco Travis Williamson Hays Bastrop Caldwell Burnet Blanco Vaccination status k = 0 Group A Group B Group C Group A Group B Group C Group A Group B Group C P r o p o r t i o n o f p o pu l a t i o n t o v a cc i n a t e Figure 3 : Proportion to vaccinate in each age group for each vaccination status deterministic model for the previously unvaccinated population , and around 5 % more for the previously vaccinated population . Lastly , our observations made from the computational results are in line with the conclusion that household size is an important contributor towards COVID - 19 transmission ( Hall et al . , 2021 ) and is a critical factor in wider community spread ( Haroon et al . , 2020 ) . Also , recent variants of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus are showing a relatively high transmission rate within a household . If a member in a household is infected , the other members who live in the same household are more likely to be infected . This means that for those who reside in larger household sizes , if one of them is infected , then there are more members likely to spread the disease to than those who reside in smaller households . 6 . Conclusion Despite concerted efforts by health authorities to contain COVID - 19 , the SARS - CoV - 2 virus has continued to spread and mutate leading to new variants with uncertain transmission characteristics . Therefore , there remains a need for new data - driven models for determining optimal vaccination strategies and other mitigation measures that adapt to the new variants and uncertain vaccine efficacy . Motivated by this challenge , we derived an integrated chance constraints stochastic programming ( ICC - SP ) approach for finding optimal vaccination strategies for epidemics that incorporates uncertain disease transmission characteristic and population demographics .

The ICC - SP approach provides a data - driven quantitative method that allows to bound the expected excess of the reproduction number above one by an acceptable amount based on the decision - maker’s level of risk . This new methodology involves a multi - community household based epidemiology model that uses census demographics data , vaccination status , age - related heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and infectivity , virus variants , and vaccine efficacy . The methodology was implemented and tested on real data for seven neighboring counties in the United States state of Texas , one of which was a large population center of the outbreak . A deterministic version of the model using the expected stochastic parameters was implemented to provide benchmark results for comparison . The results show that vaccination strategies for controlling an outbreak should prioritize vaccinating larger households as well as age groups with relatively high combined susceptibility and infectivity . The proportion to vaccinate in each county for different household sizes varies based on the risk level depending on the vaccination status and population demographics . The stochastic model suggests to vaccinate more individuals than the deterministic model under all risk levels . The deterministic model tends to be optimistic because averaging suppresses the extreme scenarios which require vaccinating more people . Considering a low - risk level , the model results recommend vaccinating about 78 % of the population that were not previously vaccinated and administering booster shots to about 47 % of the population that was previously vaccinated . In particular , the model suggests providing more vaccines to Group B , Group A , and Group C , in that order . The ICC - SP model is a data - driven prescriptive model , i . e , it uses data to prescribe the courses of action to be taken and is thus , generalizable to a given multi - community setting and infectious disease . The model requires data regarding the population demographics and disease spread parameters for the given multi - community setting in the form of probability distributions to determine optimal vaccination strategies .
