PKD phosphorylates cortactin in vitro and in vivo at serine 298 thereby generating a 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif . In vitro , a phosphorylation - deficient cortactinS298A protein accelerated VCA - Arp - cortactin - mediated synergistic actin polymerization and showed reduced F - actin binding , indicative of enhanced turnover of nucleation complexes . In vivo , cortactin co - localized with the nucleation promoting factor WAVE2 , essential for lamellipodia extension , in the actin polymerization zone in Heregulin - treated MCF - 7 cells . Using a 3 dye - FRET - based approach we further demonstrate that WAVE2 - Arp and cortactin prominently interact at these structures . Accordingly , cortactinS298A significantly enhanced lamellipodia extension and directed cell migration . Our data thus unravel a previously unrecognized mechanism by which PKD controls cancer cell motility . Introduction The mechanistic elucidation of signaling pathways regulating dynamic actin remodeling processes in migrating cells is pivotal to a comprehensive understanding of cancer cell metastasis . Protein Kinase D ( PKD ) has recently been identified as a vital upstream regulator of polarized cell motility and F - actin organization ( 1 - 4 ) . PKD localizes to sites of dynamic actin remodeling ( 1 ) The kinase activity is essential for the control of directed cell motility ( 1 , 2 ) , whereby active PKD1 inhibited , while kinase - inactive PKD1KD strongly enhanced motility and invasiveness ( 1 - 4 ) . Mechanistically , a key role for PKD1 in controlling the activity of the ubiquitous F - actin depolymerizing - and severing factor cofilin via slingshot1L cofilin phosphatase has been demonstrated . The activity of SSH1L is mainly regulated by its binding to filamentous actin ( F - actin ) which has been shown to strongly enhance its activity ( 5 , 6 ) . Phosphorylation of SSH1L at Ser978 by active PKD1 , e . g . downstream of RhoA or oxidative stress , generates a 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif within an important F - actin binding region , thus resulting in the sequestration of SSH1L away from dynamic actin structures , reducing SSH1 activity and active non - S3 - phosphorylated cofilin levels ( 2 ) . By severing actin filaments , cofilin increases both the availability of G - actin monomers as well as the number of ‘barbed ends’ for polymerization ( 7 ) . Further , severed filaments are the preferred substrate for dendritic nucleation by the Arp complex ( 8 , 9 ) . Localized induction of actin polymerization and the formation of branched actin networks constitute the basis for membrane protrusion and cell motility ( 2 , 10 , 11 ) . In line with an upstream regulatory role in the control of these processes , PKD1 and 2 are also capable of binding to F - actin in vitro ( 1 ) . In the case of PKD1 , in vivo F - actin binding has been demonstrated as well , which most likely facilitates an interaction with actin regulatory proteins such as SSH1L ( 2 ) . We now have identified a second key regulatory signaling pathway of PKD controlling WAVE2 - Arp2 / 3 - complex - driven de novo actin polymerization and lamellipodia extension via the actin - regulatory protein cortactin . Cortactin is an actin - binding protein enriched in lamellipodia of motile cells and at dynamic actin structures such as membrane ruffles ( 12 ) , circular dorsal ruffles ( 13 ) as well as invadopodia of invasive cancer cells ( 14 ) . Cortactin was further shown to co - localize with proteins of the Arp2 / 3 complex at sites of actin polymerization within lamellipodia http : / / www . jbc . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1074 / jbc .

It synergistically accelerates Arp - complex mediated actin polymerization ( 15 ) and has been shown to promote cell migration by enhancing lamellipodia persistence ( 16 ) . We have thus investigated a role of PKD as an upstream regulator of cortactin and its function in actin organization as well as cell migration . Experimental procedures Cell culture - Panc89 ( PDAC ) cells , MCF - 7 cells and HEK293T cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10 % FCS and Pen / Strep ( 1 : 100 ) . For microscopy , in the case of Panc89 cell lines , cells were seeded on cover slips coated with CollagenIV ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , whereas MCF - 7 cells were seeded on uncoated slips in sterilin dishes ( Barloworld Scientific ) at 80 , 000 cells / cover slip .

Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer . For immunoprecipitation equal amounts of proteins were incubated with specific antibodies for 1 . 5 hour at 4°C . Immune complexes were collected with protein G - Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) and washed three times with lysis buffer . Precipitated proteins were released by boiling in sample buffer and subjected to SDS - PAGE . The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes ( Pall , Germany ) . Proteins were visualized with AP - coupled secondary antibodies using NBT / BCIP as substrate or HRP - coupled secondary antibodies using ECL . In vitro kinase assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of FLAGM2 ( Sigma - Aldriche ) - affinity purified cortactin and cortactinS298A as substrate with ~ 250ng of purified PKD1 from Baculo - infected insect cells or purified His - tagged PKD1KD ( kindly provided by A . Toker , Harvard ) . Kinase reactions were performed for 15 minutes at 37°C in 30 µ l kinase buffer ( 50mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 10mM MgCl 2 and 2mM DTT ) containing 2 µ Ci [ 32P * ] - ATP . To terminate reaction , 10µl of 5x SDS - sample buffer were added . Samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE , blotted onto nitrocellulose and analyzed on a phosphoimager ( GE Healthcare ) . Quantification was done with ImageQuant software ( GE Healthcare ) . FLAG - M2 - affinity purification of cortactin and high - speed F - actin binding assays - High - speed F - actin binding assays were essentially performed as described in ( 1 ) . FLAG - M2 - affinity purification of cortactin and cortactinS298A was performed from five 10 cm culture dishes . M2 - affinity purification was performed with 100 µ l M2 - agarose ( Sigma - by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD controls actin dynamics via Cortactin Eiseler et al . 2009 3 Aldriche ) according to the manufactures description . Bound FLAG - cortactin was eluded after extensive washing steps with 3 times 200µl 100mM glycine pH 3 . 5 in reaction tubes containing 1 . 5M Tris pH 8 . 8 to buffer the eluate . FLAG - cortactin / FLAG - cortactinS298A concentrations were subsequently assed by Bradford assay and purity was tested by SDS - Page . High - speed binding assays were done by incubating 2 µ g / 0 . 5 µ g cortactin and cortactinS298A with 10 µ g in vitro polymerized F - actin ( AKL99 , Cytoskeleton Inc . ) for 30 min at RT in F - buffer ( 10mM imidazole , pH 7 . 2 , 75mM KCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5mM DTT and 1mM EGTA supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor ( EDTA free ) and PhosStop ( Roche Applied Science ) ) . Assays were subjected to centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 1h at RT . The supernatant was removed and the pellet was incubated for 1h in G - buffer ( 5mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 0 . 5mM DTT , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 2mM ATP ) to depolymerize F - actin . Equal amounts of supernatant and pellet fraction were analyzed by SDS page followed by Coomassie staining or Western blot . Integrated density of bands was quantified using NIH ImageJ . In vitro Pyrene - actin polymerization assays - Pyrene - actin polymerization assays with purified proteins were performed as follows . Pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle G - actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) was diluted at 3 µ M in G - buffer ( 5mM Tris - HCL pH8 , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 2mM fresh ATP ) . In vitro polymerization assays were performed in black 96 well plates ( Greiner Bio - one ) in a volume of 100 µ l . Triplicate wells per reaction condition were assayed : G - buffer , Pyrene - actin , Pyrene - actin / 50nM Arp complex ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) , Pyrene - actin / 50nM Arp / 400nM GST - VCA ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) as well as Pyrene - actin / 50nM Arp / 400nM GST - VCA and 1000nM FLAG - purified cortactin or cortactinS298A . Polymerization reactions were started immediately prior to measurement by the addition of 10 µ l 10x F - buffer ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) . The increase in Pyrene fluorescence following polymerization was measured with a Tecan M200 plate reader : Ex : 360nm , Em : 407nm every 30s . To quantify changes in polymerization rate , curves were fitted with Boltzmann sigmoidal equations ( GraphPad , Prism ) . Half - maxima of saturated polymerization values ( T½Max [ s ] ) and % saturation of individual polymerization reactions were calculated from RAW data . Migration assays - Migration assays were performed using 24 well Transwell filter inserts ( Corning ) with 8 µM pore diameter . Panc89 cells were seeded at a density of 60 , 000 cells / insert . Migration was induced by a serum gradient of - FCS - 10 % for 40h . The inside of the Transwell insert was wiped with a cotton swab to remove non - migrated cells . Migrated cells were fixed using 4 % paraformaldehyde stained with DAPI and visualized using a widefield fluorescence microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a CCD camera , and a monochromator light source at 10x magnification . Results were calculated as average number of migrated cells / visual field with at least 6 images per filter . In - vitro branching assays - 3 µ M seed - free G - actin was polymerized in the presence of an equimolar amount Alexa - 488 - Phalloidin in G - buffer to stabilize filaments . Reaction conditions were as follows : 50nM Arp complex ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) , 400nM GST - VCA ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) and 1000nM FLAG - purified cortactin or cortactinS298A . Polymerization reactions were started by the addition of 10x F - buffer ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) . Reactions were terminated after 10 min by the addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 4 % for 15’ . Samples were quenched with glycine and mounted as 1 : 10 dilution in Fluoromount G . Filaments were visualized at 100x magnification by a Leica widefield fluorescence microscope using 510 / 30 filters . To enhance filament detection , 5 images each ( cortactin / cortactinS298A ) were brightness and contrast enhanced , SPE - processed , segmented , and subjected to automatic detection by a 20 - inf filter ( NIH ImageJ ) after highly - branched filaments with > 2 branches were singled out manually and excluded from automatic detection . Quantified was the ratio of the total number of filaments ( 5 images ) / filaments with branches > 2 and % branched filaments . Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy - Panc89 and MCF - 7 cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature ( RT ) for 20 min , washed , quenched with 0 . 1M glycine and then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X100 . Samples were blocked and stained in PBS by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD controls actin dynamics via Cortactin Eiseler et al . 2009 4 supplemented with 5 % FCS / 0 . 05 % Tween20 . Primary as well as secondary Alexa - dye antibodies ( Invitrogen ) were incubated for 2h . Samples were mounted after extensive washing in FluoromountG ( Southern Biotechnology , AL ) and analyzed by a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope ( TCS SP2 , Leica , Germany ) or a LSM 710 ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with respective 63x Plan Apo oil immersion objectives . GFP or Alexa488 were excited with the 488 nm line and fluorescence was detected at 500 - 535 nm . Alexa546 and Cy5 or Alexa633 were excited with the 543 nm ( Leica ) , the 561nm line ( Zeiss ) and the 633 nm line for Cy5 / Alexa633 respectively . Dyes were detected at 550 - 620 nm and 640 - 720 nm . Images were acquired in sequential scan mode and processed using NIH ImageJ . Acceptor - photobleach FRET experiments - Acceptor - photobleach FRET experiments were performed with MCF - 7 cells stimulated with Heregulin . In brief , MCF - 7 cells seeded on cover slips were transfected , serum - starved over night and stimulated with Heregulin at 100ng / ml for 10 min . Samples were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and subjected to immunohistochemistry . FRET measurements were performed by acquiring a time - bleach image series using a LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Zeiss , Jena ) equipped with a 63x Plan Apo oil immersion objective . In experiments with Arp3 - Alexa546 as FRET - acceptor , fluorescence of the acceptor was bleached using an intensive 561 nm laser line . For 3 - dye ‘daisy - chain’ acceptor - photobleach - FRET experiments with WAVE2 - GFP as primary FRET - donor , FLAG - cortactin stained with α - FLAG M2 - Alexa - 633 secondary antibody as final FRET - acceptor and F - actin ( Phalloidine - Alexa546 ) as FRET - signal “transducer” , the final acceptor cortactin - FLAG - Alexa633 was bleached with the 633 laser line . % FRET images were generated with ZEN - Software ( LSM 710 confocal microscope , Zeiss , Jena ) using images immediately before and after the bleach . The Bezier bleach ROI and rectangle threshold ROI used to eliminate ‘off target - bleached pixels’ are shown in figures . For the 3 - dye ‘daisy - chain’ FRET experiments also RAW data and RAW % FRET values were calculated by Mean of ROI analysis using Zen - Software . Kymograph analysis of extending lamellipodia visualized by YFP - actin in MCF - 7 cells - Low level GFP - G - actin expression can be used to measure actin polymerization in vivo ( 19 ) . We therefore used YFP - G - actin co - transfection to visualize actin polymerization and extension of lamellipodia in MCF - 7 cells . For these experiments cells were seeded at a density of 80 , 000 cells / well in 4 - chamber Cellview glass - bottom dishes . Cells were transfected at a ratio of 3 : 1 with FLAG - vector / FLAG - cortactin / FLAG - cortactinS298A : YFP - G - actin to visualize polymerization , serum - starved over night and stimulated at T120s after initiation of image acquisition with 100ng / ml Heregulin . Time - laps videos of stimulated cells were generated by acquiring images of YFP fluorescence ( Ex YFP : 500 / 20 , Em YFP : 535 / 30 ) every 10s for 20 min at 63x magnification with a Leica widefield fluorescence video microscope setup for live cell imaging with 37°C heating chamber as well as CO 2 supply . Subsequently kymographs were generated with NIH ImageJ plug - ins by plotting the edge of the protruding lamellipodia visualized by YFP - G - actin against time [ pixel / 10s ] along a 1 pixel line perpendicular to the protrusion front for initially individual protrusions of 6 cells per construct ( already showing statistical significance ) . The protrusion velocity [ pixel / min ] was calculated from kymographs during the linear phase of extension indicated by white lines in kymogrames with a respective time difference of 1min . Using the spatial calibration of images velocity was also calculated as [ µ m / min ] . In line with literature ( 16 ) vector controls displayed reduced protrusion persistence when compared to cortactin and cortactinS298A cells which did not allow for the same quantification and statistical analysis . Statistic analyses - Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software algorithms . Results PKD co - localizes and interacts with cortactin at Arp3 - positive structures - Using Panc89 cells derived from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma we have investigated the role of cortactin and the potential upstream regulatory function of PKD in the control of pancreatic cancer cell motility . Autophosphorylated endogenous PKD colocalized with F - actin at the by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD controls actin dynamics via Cortactin Eiseler et al . 2009 5 edge of lamellipodia ( Fig . 1 , A - C ) as well as with cortactin at lamellipodia , in membrane ruffles and at microspikes within the protrusion ( Fig . 1 , D - F ) . Autophosphorylated PKD also co - localized with Arp3 at the edge of lamellipodia and in ruffle zones ( Fig . 1 , G - H ) , pointing to a putative role of PKD together with cortactin in Arp - complex mediated actin remodeling . We next used Panc89 cells stably expressing GFP - tagged wild type PKD1 and kinase - inactive PKD1KD ( 1 ) to identify a potential function of PKD and cortactin in Arp complex mediated de novo actin polymerization as well as directed cell migration . As demonstrated for endogenous PKD , ectopically expressed PKD1 - GFP showed enhanced co - localization with endogenous cortactin and F - actin at membrane ruffles of lamellipodia - like protrusions ( Fig . 2A , A - J ) in these cells . Moreover , both PKD1 - and PKD1KD - GFP could be co - precipitated with endogenous cortactin ( Fig . 2B ) . Reciprocal co - immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed PKD1 - GFP and FLAG - cortactin in HEK293T cells confirmed the specificity of this interaction ( Fig . 2C ) . PKD - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin at S298 creates a 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif - Since PKD and cortactin show overlapping sub - cellular localization and interaction in Panc89 as well as HEK293T cells , we were prompted to investigate whether cortactin is a direct substrate of PKD and whether respective phosphorylation sites are situated in important structural domains of the protein . Fig . 3A depicts a structural overview of cortactin . The N - terminal region of cortactin harbors an acidic motif ( NTA ) with DDW consensus sequences , which have been shown to mediate binding of cortactin to Arp3 , a member of the 7 protein Arp complex ( 20 ) . Cortactin also possesses an extended region of 6 and ½ so - called HS - 1 repeats containing dedicated sequence motifs for F - actin interaction . The C - terminal part of the protein harbors a helical domain ( H ) , a prolin - rich stretch of amino acids ( P ) and an SH3 - binding motif ( 21 ) for recruitment of co - regulatory proteins such as WIP or WISH ( 21 , 22 ) . Following a sequence analysis for PKD consensus phosphorylation motifs , we decided to focus our investigation on Ser298 as a potentially important PKD phosphorylation site with the consensus LAKHES * located in the 6 th F - actin binding repeat . As shown in Fig . 3A , the cortactin consensus does not fully match the published PKD consensus sequence since there is no arginine ( R ) at - 2 / 3 position ( 23 ) . However , positively charged histidine ( H ) and lysine ( K ) residues at the - 2 and 3 position might be able to compensate for the arginine . Recently , in vivo phosphorylation of this site by PKD has been published , however , neither the biological significance nor mechanistic consequences of this phosphorylation have been addressed in this study ( 24 ) . We thus opted to investigate the biological relevance of this site since it has been demonstrated for a number of F - actin binding proteins that phosphorylation alters F - actin binding capacity impacting its specific function ( 2 , 5 , 25 ) . The phosphorylation of respective consensus sites in some instances also generates 14 - 3 - 3 protein binding motifs impacting protein function and biological readouts ( 2 , 18 , 23 , 26 ) . Using purified PKD1 and FLAG - affinity purified cortactin / cortactinS298A proteins isolated from HEK293T cells , we here show that PKD1 phosphorylates S298 in cortactin in vitro ( supplemental Fig . 1A ) . We furthermore demonstrate a PKD - dependent in vivo phosphorylation at this site using a site - specific pS298 - antibody ( 24 ) following PKD - knockdown , both for ectopically expressed FLAG - cortactin ( Fig . 3B ) as well as for endogenous cortactin ( Fig . 3D ) . Additional co - expression experiments with FLAG - cortactin , FLAG - cortactinS298A and active ( CA ) / kinase - inactive ( KD ) PKD1 constructs also support in vivo phosphorylation of this site ( supplemental Fig . 1B ) . In order to assess whether phosphorylation of S298 in cortactin generates a 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif , we performed pulldown assays with GST - 14 - 3 - 3 β− coated beads from HEK293T total cell lysates expressing FLAG - tagged cortactin as well as the cortactinS298A mutant ( Fig . 3C ) . The S298A mutation reduced pulldown of the respective mutant protein 11 . 6 fold indicating the generation of a functional 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif in cortactin upon phosphorylation . GST - 14 - 3 - 3 β - pulldown assays of endogenous cortactin following expression of active PKD1CA or kinase - inactive PKD1KD constructs ( Fig . 3E ) corroborate PKD - mediated phosphorylation and 14 - 3 - 3 binding to endogenous cortactin in vivo . CortactinS298A enhances polarized cell migration - Since we have already shown that the by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD controls actin dynamics via Cortactin Eiseler et al . 2009 6 activity status of PKD affects Panc89 as well as breast cancer cell motility ( 1 , 3 ) and cortactin has been published to affect cell migration ( 16 ) we were prompted to test whether cortactin or its respective S298A mutation would alter migration of Panc89 cells towards a chemotactic serum gradient in Transwell migration assays . In line with ( 1 ) , the results summarized in Fig . 4 revealed that expression of PKD1 - GFP inhibited migration relative to the GFP transfected control cells ( 42 . 17 vs . 137 . 0 cells / field , n = 3 ) while expression of kinase - inactive PKD1KD - GFP strongly enhanced motility ( 340 . 3 vs 137 cells / field , n = 3 ) . Cortactin - GFP expressing cells displayed moderately reduced motility ( 92 . 83 cells / field n = 3 ) relative to GFP control whereas cortactinS298A - GFP ( 386 . 2 cell / field n = 3 ) strongly enhanced migration compared to cells expressing wild type cortactin or GFP , indicating that the phosphorylation of S298 has a strong negative modulatory role in cancer cell motility . The equal expression of GFP fusion proteins for these experiments was evaluated by Western Blots ( supplemental Fig . 2 ) and FACS analysis ( data not shown ) . Cortactin and cortactinS298A synergistically enhance Arp complex mediated actin nucleation - To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which cortactin phosphorylation affects cell motility we studied cortactin in actin remodeling processes , especially in Arp complex - driven actin polymerization . To that end we performed in vitro actin polymerization assays with Pyrene - labeled G - actin , purified Arp complex , purified GST - VCA minimal fragment ( NPF ) as well as FLAG - affinity purified cortactin and cortactinS298A , respectively , and the kinetic of polymerization was measured by increase in Pyrene fluorescence ( Fig . 5A ) . Half - maxima of saturated polymerization values ( T1 / 2Max [ s ] ) calculated from Boltzmann sigmoidal curve fits are summarized in Fig . 5B . T½Max values for actin and actin / Arp reactions are 997 . 6 ± 7 . 4 s and 1043 ± 8 . 42 s , respectively . This slow spontaneous polymerization as well as no nucleation in the absence of nucleation promoting factors , even if Arp complex is present , is in full accordance with literature ( 12 , 15 , 21 ) . As expected , GST - VCA minimal fragment strongly enhanced the polymerization rate with T½Max of 488 . 8 ± 2 . 27 s . Weaver and colleagues further proposed that cortactin can synergistically accelerate VCA / Arp - driven actin polymerization in vitro ( 15 ) . According to their model , cortactin is able to alter the nucleation rate by competing for Arp3 binding via its N - terminal region , while VCA , or full - length NPFs , would bind to Arp2 and ARPC1 ( p40 ) instead of Arp2 / 3 and p40 when cortactin is not present . Thus they have suggested that under saturated conditions cortactin may be able to bridge the Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments via Arp3 and that VCA activates the Arp2 / 3 complex by binding Arp2 and / or ARPC1 / p40 . In support of this hypothesis , we observed enhanced polymerization rates in reactions where 1000 nM cortactin was present ( VCA : cortactin > 1 : 2 ) , assuring saturating concentrations for cortactin during polymerization ( T½Max of 394 . 9 ± 1 . 66 s ) . CortactinS298A was able to accelerate this polymerization rate even further with T½Max values of 343 . 2 ± 1 . 53 s . A significant ( p < 0 . 05 ; * ) difference in synergistic polymerization rates between cortactin and cortactinS298A became evident , too , when the amount of polymerized F - actin plotted as % of saturation of individual reactions was analyzed at two time points during linear phase ( T420 / T450s ) ( supplemental Fig . 3A ) . Cortactin reached 65 . 3 and 76 . 63 % saturation , while cortactinS298A showed 84 . 63 and 90 . 67 % of saturation for time points T420s and T450s , respectively , amounting to a relative increase in polymerized F - actin of 19 . 6 % ( T420s ) or 14 . 04 % ( T450s ) . Since Weaver et al . proposed a mechanism by which cortactin would be able to bridge the Arp complex to actin filaments during synergistic nucleation ( 15 ) , we investigated further to what extent in vitro F - actin binding capacities of purified FLAG - cortactin and cortactinS298A proteins would be altered . We performed 100 , 000 x g high - speed F - actin sedimentation assays to study binding of purified cortactin / cortactinS298A to in vitro polymerized F - actin . The supernatant and F - actin pellet fractions obtained following ultracentrifugation were resolved on 10 % SDS - PAGE gels . Fig . 5C shows that the deletion of the S298 phosphorylation site reduced the in vitro F - actin binding capacity of cortactin . Wild type cortactin and cortactinS298A displayed a ratio of supernatant / pellet fraction integrated band density ( S / P ) of 1 . 64 and 2 . 2 , respectively , indicative of weaker binding of the mutated cortactin to F - actin ( pellet fraction ; Ratio S / P difference 25 . 5 % ) . The experiment was also performed with lower by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD controls actin dynamics via Cortactin Eiseler et al . 2009 7 amounts of cortactin ( 0 . 5µg / 10µg actin ) to rule out possible saturation effects . Under these conditions , almost a complete loss of the cortactin signal in the pellet fraction was observed ( supplemental Fig . 3B ) , confirming the above data of reduced actin binding capacity of cortactinS298A compared to wild type cortactin . By interfering with the F - actin binding capacity of cortactin , the ablation of S298 phosphorylation and concomitant loss of 14 - 3 - 3 binding might be able to alter the capability of cortactin to bridge the Arp complex to actin filaments during synergistic nucleation and thus enhance turnover of the nucleation complex at relevant sites . In vitro branching assays performed with cortactin and cortactinS298A further suggest a reduced ability of cortactinS298A to stabilize highly - branched filament networks formed during in vitro nucleation , as the % of filaments with > 2 branches is reduced by 29 . 2 % in respect to wild type cortactin ( supplemental Fig . 3C ) . Cortactin and WAVE2 co - localize and interact in the active polymerization zone at the edge of lamellipodia in Heregulin - stimulated MCF - 7 cells - To study biological implications of the enhanced actin polymerization rate and of an enhanced turnover of Arp2 / 3 nucleation complexes by cortactinS298A in vivo , we used MCF - 7 breast cancer cells as a model system . In MCF - 7 cells strong actin polymerization and extension of lamellipodia can be induced following stimulation with the growth factor Heregulin ( 27 ) . During lamellipodia formation WAVE class nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , such as WAVE2 , are major activators of the Arp complex in the polymerization zone at the edge of protruding lamellipodia ( 22 ) . WAVE2 , but not WAVE1 , has also been shown to be essential for directed cell migration and lamellipodia formation in WAVE1 / 2 - deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( 28 ) . Unlike N - WASP , an NPF existing in a closed auto - inhibitory conformation and an open , active conformational state accessible for co - activators like CDC42 or PIP2 ( 21 , 29 ) , WAVE2 is not regulated by such conformation changes . Instead , WAVE2 is activated downstream of Rac , which is in turn activated by Heregulin stimulation in MCF - 7 cells ( 27 ) . WAVE2 , however , does not interact with Rac directly . Its activity is rather modulated within multi - protein complexes by co - factors such as IRSp53 , an essential intermediate signaling component of Rac to WAVE2 ( 22 , 30 ) . Since WAVE2 activation cannot be measured by applying intramolecular FRET - biosensors similar to N - WASP ( 29 ) , we have defined WAVE2 as being ‘active’ once it is present in the nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex at the edge of protruding lamellipodia . We have investigated the localization of WAVE2 - GFP in relation to the markers Arp3 and F - actin in MCF - 7 cells stimulated with 100ng / ml Heregulin for 10min ( panel A - D ) and in serum - starved control cells ( panel E - H ) ( Fig . 6A ) . WAVE2 - GFP co - localized with Arp3 and F - actin at the edge of lamellipodia in membrane ruffles of MCF - 7 breast cancer cells . The proteins also overlapped considerably within the cytoplasm in the perinuclear region following stimulation with Heregulin for 10 min . In serum - starved control cells , WAVE2 - GFP , Arp3 and F - actin only demonstrated minimal , or no co - localization at all . Supplemental Fig . 4E depicts an exemplary acceptor - photobleach - FRET experiment with WAVE2 - GFP as FRET - donor and endogenous Arp3 detected by a monoclonal primary and Alexa - 546 secondary antibody as FRET - acceptor . Increase in donor fluorescence following bleaching of the FRET acceptor indicates FRET prior to bleaching and thus molecular interaction . Of particular relevance is the presence of WAVE2 within FRET distance ( < 10nm ) to Arp3 in the polymerization zone at the edge of extending lamellipodia , which meets prominently the above defined criteria as being present and ‘active’ in nucleating Arp2 / 3 complexes during lamellipodia extension . In addition , FRET signals were also observed in a perinuclear region , were both proteins are located as well . Respective pre - and post - bleach images of donor ( A , B ) and acceptor ( C , D ) are depicted in supplemental Fig . 4E . FRET was quantified by acquiring a time - bleach image series of cells . The thresholded % FRET image depicting localization and FRET efficiency ( 14 . 6 % mean for the entire bleach ROI ) coded in Rainbow LUT as well as respective bleach and background ROIs ( excluding pixels with ‘off - target’ acceptor - bleaching ) used to generate the image are shown in E . We further investigated the localization of FLAG - cortactin and FLAG - cortactinS298A with respect to WAVE2 - GFP and F - actin ( Phalloidin - by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD controls actin dynamics via Cortactin Eiseler et al . 2009 8 Alexa546 ) . There was no difference in sub - cellular localization of cortactin and cortactinS298A with respect to these markers . As shown in Fig . 6B WAVE2 and cortactin ( panels A - D ) as well as cortactinS298A ( panel E - H ) co - localized with dynamic actin in the polymerization zone at the edge of lamellipodia in MCF - 7 cells following Heregulin stimulation ( panels A - H ) . The three proteins also co - localized in peripheral ruffles of lamellipodia as well as in the cytoplasmic perinuclear region ( supplemental Fig . 4B , panels I - P ) , whereas co - localization in serum - starved control cells was limited to small ruffle zones and peripheral dot like structures ( supplemental Fig . 4A , panels A - H ) . In conclusion we were able to show a prominent co - localization of WAVE2 with FLAG - cortactin at highly dynamic actin structures at the edge of lamellipodia within the active polymerization zone or peripheral membrane ruffles , which are formed as a direct consequence of strong actin polymerization at these structures . Cortactin bridges active WAVE2 / Arp2 / 3 complexes to actin filaments at extending lamellipodia in Heregulin - stimulated MCF - 7 cells - We next asked whether cortactin might be involved in bridging the Arp complex to actin filaments during synergistic polymerization ( 15 ) , thereby effectively altering the branching status of the filament network . We performed a 3 - dye ‘daisy - chain’ acceptor - photobleach - FRET experiment ( Fig . 6C ) in Heregulin - stimulated MCF - 7 cells . WAVE2 - GFP was used as primary FRET - donor , FLAG - cortactin stained with α - FLAGM2 and Alexa - 633 secondary antibodies as final FRET - acceptor , whereas F - actin ( Phalloidine - Alexa546 ) served as intermediate FRET - signal “transducer” . In this constellation , Foerster energy transfer to the final acceptor is only possible when all 3 dyes are within FRET - distance , inferring simultaneous interaction of the three proteins . In Fig . 6C pre - and post - bleach images of donor ( panels A , B ) , acceptor ( panels C , D ) and transducer ( panels E , F ) are depicted . Again FRET was quantified by acquiring a time - bleach image series of cells for the respective channels . The final ‘daisy - chain’ FRET - acceptor Alexa633 - labeled FLAG - cortactin was bleached with an intensive laser beam at 633 nM . Foerster energy transfer of the primary donor ( WAVE2 - GFP ) transduced via Alexa - 546 - labeled F - actin was visualized by increase in primary donor fluorescence after bleaching . % FRET images ( panel H ) were thresholded using the rectangle ROI in ( panel H ) . The thresholded FRET - pixels in ( panel H ) displayed a mean efficiency of 45 . 7 % for the entire bleach region . In order to show that cortactin will only bridge ‘active’ nucleation complexes as identified by WAVE2 - GFP , we went on to evaluate the non - thresholded RAW data of the ‘daisy - chain’ FRET experiment by Mean of ROI analysis with Sub - ROIs 2 and 3 located within the bleach region ( ROI1 ) ( supplemental Fig . 4C ) Sub - ROI2 was placed at peripheral dynamic ruffling structures at the edge of lamellipodia , whereas Sub - ROI3 marked non - dynamic actin arc filaments with FLAG - cortactin and WAVE2 - GFP still co - localizing within the ROI ( panel G , see arrowheads ) . The transducer F - actin ( Phalloidine - Alexa546 ) only mediated FRET signals to FLAG - cortactin in this setup at Sub - ROI2 but not at Sub - ROI3 as indicated by the Mean of ROI intensity RAW data for ROIs 2 and 3 and the RAW non - thresholded mean % FRET values of 18 . 57 % for the entire bleach ROI1 , 15 . 2 % for Sub - ROI2 ( dynamic actin ) and no FRET transduced for Sub - ROI3 ( actin arc filaments ) . Analysis of a second cell is depicted in supplemental Fig . 4D . Uncoupling of the weak 3 - dye dipole interaction by bleaching the final acceptor FLAG - cortactin - Alexa - 633 also results in the increase in F - actin - 546 transducer fluorescence , acting as donor for the Alexa - 633 dye ( supplemental Fig . 4C , D ) . This further demonstrates the specificity of the used approach . CortactinS298A accelerates actin polymerization kinetics and extension of lamellipodia in Heregulin - stimulated MCF - 7 cells - Based on these results , we studied next dynamic changes in synergistic actin polymerization mediated by cortactin and cortactinS298A during lamellipodia extension after Heregulin stimulation in MCF - 7 cells . Low level co - expression of GFP - tagged G - actin can be used to visualize actin polymerization in vivo ( 19 ) . Fig . 7A ( panels C - F ) depict snapshot images of widefield fluorescence microscopy videos visualizing actin polymerization and lamellipodia extension of MCF - 7 cells ectopically expressing cortactin / YFP - G - actin ( panel C , T0 ; panel D , 20min ) and cortactinS298A / YFP - G - actin ( panel E , T0 ; panel F , 20min ) as well as FLAG - vector / YFP - G - actin ( supplemental Fig . 5 , panel B , T0 ; panel by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD controls actin dynamics via Cortactin Eiseler et al . 2009 9 C , 20min ) at a ratio of 3 : 1 . Time - laps videos of YFP fluorescence were acquired at 63x magnification every 10s for 20min . Cells were stimulated at T120s after starting the acquisition . Then a kymography analysis of the protruding edge of the lamellipodia as visualized by polymerized YFP - actin was performed . In Fig . 7A ( panels A , B ) overlay images of cells with 1 pixel lines used to generate the kymograms are displayed . Protrusion velocities from kymograms were calculated as [ pixel / min ] along the highlighted lines oriented perpendicular to the protrusion front of initially individual protrusions . Sample kymograms used to calculate protrusion velocity at the indicated white lines are also shown in Fig . 7A . Fig . 7B displays the results of a statistical analysis ( n = 6 ) for cortactin ( n = 17 lamellipodia ) and cortactinS298A ( n = 25 lamellipodia ) already reaching statistical significance ( p = 0 . 0127 ) . Shown are protrusion velocities [ pixel / min ] with standard errors ( SE ) for cortactin amounting to 8 . 0000 ± 0 . 4537 [ pixel / min ] = 1 . 6667 µ m / min and cortactinS298A 9 . 640 ± 0 . 4159 = 2 . 0083 µ m / min , indicating that the S298A mutation enhanced the velocity of protrusion by 20 . 5 % . Interestingly , actin polymerization in Pyrene - actin assays at T420s during the linear polymerization phase also demonstrated an increase in polymerized F - actin by 19 . 6 % for cortactinS298A compared to wild type cortactin ( Fig . 5B ) . The latter can be explained by increased nucleation kinetics , which in turn could be responsible for the observed equivalent increase in lamellipodia extension velocity . In accordance with literature ( 16 ) , vector transfected cells displayed reduced persistence of protrusions ( supplemental Fig . 5 , A - C ) when compared to cortactin or cortactinS298A cells , which did not allow for a similar quantification and statistical analysis . Discussion PKD has been described as a key regulator of the cofilin signaling pathway thereby controlling actin remodeling and polarized cell motility in cervix carcinoma , breast cancer and pancreatic cancer cells ( 1 - 4 , 31 ) . We here describe a novel PKD - controlled pathway targeting Arp complex mediated actin polymerization via the F - actin binding protein cortactin . Our data fully support and expand the model proposed by Weaver et al ( 15 ) for a potential role of cortactin in bridging the Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments at peripheral dynamic actin structures during synergistic polymerization , using WAVE2 as nucleation promoting factor in Heregulin stimulated MCF - 7 cells . In addition , we show that cortactinS298A was able to enhance synergistic actin polymerization in vitro and , due to its reduced F - actin binding capacity , might also enhance turnover of nucleation complexes at respective dynamic actin structures . By visualizing actin polymerization and lamellipodia protrusion velocities in the MCF - 7 model system , we were further able to demonstrate the significance of cortactin and specifically of the PKD phosphorylation site at serine 298 in affecting actin polymerization and velocity of lamellipodia protrusion in vivo . Taken together , the above described molecular mechanism suffices to explain the enhanced motility of Panc89 pancreatic cancer cells expressing cortactinS298A as opposed to wild type cortactin . Thus , a new regulatory role for PKD in the modulation of Arp complex mediated actin polymerization through cortactinS298 phosphorylation becomes evident , which affects cancer cell motility and therefore adds to the previously described mechanism of PKD mediated regulation of cell migration through control of SSH1 activity ( 2 ) . Accordingly , localized PKD activity is able to modulate actin remodeling events at several , independent levels by phosphorylation of actin regulatory proteins , which control the polymerization and depolymerization processes of the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 8 ) . The modulation of both pathways by PKD fully accounts for the observed inhibition and enhancement , respectively , of cancer cell motility by active and kinase - inactive PKD ( 1 , 2 ) . Dynamic regulation of localized PKD activity , e . g . downstream of RhoA , during different stages of cell migration is necessary to fine - tune actin reorganization and polymerization events , providing the basis for altering cell motility . As proposed previously ( 8 , 9 ) , cofilin has important functions in controlling the initial directional response of cells after sensing a chemotactic gradient . Cofilin severs old filaments replenishing the G - actin pool of cells and it generates new ‘free barbed ends’ after being by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD controls actin dynamics via Cortactin Eiseler et al . 2009 10 recruited to the active polymerization zone at what will become the leading edge of cells oriented towards a growth factor gradient ( 7 ) . By controlling cofilin activity via regulation of availability of the cofilin - phosphatase SSH1 , PKD can vitally alter this early response of cells ( 2 ) . Once polymerization has been initiated , Arp complex mediated polymerization and the formation of branched actin networks is a second key factor supporting lamellipodia extension and eventually the chemotactic movement of cells ( 7 ) . We have shown here that PKD can regulate this process by acting on WAVE2 / Arp complex mediated synergistic actin polymerization via phosphorylation of S298 of cortactin . Cortactin acts in conjunction with NPFs , like WAVE2 ( 22 ) and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 20 ) to synergistically enhance actin polymerization kinetics and to bridge the nucleating Arp complex to actin filaments ( 15 , 32 ) . We show that bridging as demonstrated by the 3 - dye FRET approach is restricted to dynamic actin structures and not to arc filaments at the cell periphery ( polymerization zone ) . Our in vitro data further suggest that the stabilization of highly - branched filament networks is reduced by the S298A mutation , concomitant with its reduced ability to bind to F - actin filaments , allowing for a more “flexible” , higher turnover - rate of the branched network in lamellipodia . Recently , a comprehensive mass spectroscopy analysis identified 17 novel phosphorylation sites in cortactin , among them serine 113 ( 33 ) Interestingly , the serine / threonine kinase PAK1 was identified to directly phosphorylate cortactin on serine 113 thereby down - regulating F - actin binding to cortactin ( 34 ) . We here describe a similar mechanism for PKD - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin on serine 298 . In vivo phosphorylation of serine 298 , which is located within the 6th F - actin - binding repeat , was confirmed by mass spectrometry ( 24 ) . On top of that , we provide evidence that phosphorylation of serine 298 generates a 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif . 14 - 3 - 3 proteins are scaffold proteins whose binding can alter the localization , stability , phosphorylation state , activity and / or molecular interactions of a target protein . Phosphorylation by PKD is not required for the translocation of cortactin to lamellipodia or membrane ruffles . Instead , we demonstrate that ablation of S298 phosphorylation by serine to alanin mutation reduces F - actin binding of cortactin , inferring increased turnover of nucleation complexes at relevant sites . Loss of 14 - 3 - 3 binding could thus induce changes in the 3 - dimensional structure of cortactin thereby masking the respective F - actin binding site . In conclusion our previous findings , and the data presented herein , provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of PKD as a negative regulator of cell migration affecting actin polymerization at different levels , as summarized in Fig . 8 . In addition to controlling cancer cell motility , PKD is known as a key regulator of vesicular transport ( 35 - 37 ) . Furthermore , in breast cancer cells PKD was shown to down - regulate the expression of a number of matrix - metalloproteases ( MMPs ) , which are key factors for cancer cell invasiveness ( 3 ) . Thus , a potentially important role of PKD in controlling cancer progression and metastasis can be postulated . References 1 . Eiseler , T . , Schmid , M .

MCF - 7 cell were transfected at a ratio of 3 : 1 with FLAG - cortactin / FLAG - cortactinS298A : YFP - G - actin to visualize actin polymerization . For kymograph analysis time - laps images of Heregulin - stimulated cell were acquired using a Leica widefield fluorescence microscope every 10s at 63x magnification . Kymographs were generated with NIH ImageJ by plotting the edge of the protruding lamellipodia visualized by YFP - G - actin against time [ pixel / 10s ] along a 1 pixel line perpendicular to the protrusion front for initially individual protrusions . The protrusion velocity was calculated from kymographs during the linear phase of extension . Vector controls ( Supplemental Fig . 7 , A - C ) showed in line with ( 16 ) reduced protrusion persistence when compared to cortactin cells . Plotted in the figure are overlay images with kymography lines and samples kymograms for cortactin ( A , C , D ) and cortactinS298A ( B , E , F ) transfected cells . White lines with a relative time difference of ∆ 60s indicate were the velocities were measured . ( B ) Quantification and statistical analysis of kymograms . For cortactin ( N = 6 cells , N = 17 lamellipodia kymographs ) and cortactinS298A ( N = 6 cells , N = 25 lamellipodia kymographs ) were analyzed . Shown in the graph are the protrusion velocities [ pixel / min ] with standard errors ( SE ) . Velocities were also calculated as µ m / min using the spatial calibration of images . The scale bar represents 10 µ M . Statistical significance evaluated by student t - test is marked by an asterisk ( p = 0 . 0127 ) . Figure 8 : Protein Kinase D ( PKD ) mediated effects of actin remodeling : PKD is a key novel regulator of polarized cell motility and F - actin organization . PKD is capable of binding to F - actin in vitro and in vivo , a feature of many actin regulatory proteins . PKD controls the activity of the ubiquitous F - actin depolymerizing - and severing factor cofilin via slingshot family cofilin phosphatases . It modulates the supply of G - actin monomers and the generation of barbed - ends at the leading edge of motile cells , which ultimately translates in membrane protrusion and cell migration . Cofilin is inactivated downstream of Rho - GTPases . Active RhoA , Rac and CDC42 mediate the activation of LIMK via Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) or p21 – activated kinases ( PAK1 / 4 ) respectively . LIMK then inactivates cofilin by phosphorylation at S3 . Slingshot family phosphatases ( SSH ) regenerate cofilin activity by dephosphorylation . SSH1 is negatively regulated by direct upstream phosphorylation via Protein Kinase D downstream of RhoA , or oxidative stress . Phosphorylation of S978 mediates 14 - 3 - 3 binding and sequestration of SSH away from F - actin which drastically reduces SSH cofilin - phosphatase activity . In line with this data we have identified the actin binding protein cortactin as a second key F - actin regulatory protein controlled by PKD . Cortactin acts in conjunction with nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , like WAVE2 as well as the Arp2 / 3 complex to synergistically enhance actin polymerization rates and to bridge the nucleating Arp complexes to actin filaments . PKD phosphorylates cortactin in vitro and in vivo at S298 generating a 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif . Ablation of S298 phosphorylation reduces F - actin binding of cortactin inferring increased turnover of nucleation complexes at relevant sites . Loss or ablation ( SA mutation ) of S298 phosphorylation synergistically accelerates WAVE2 - Arp - driven actin polymerization , lamellipodia extension and directed cell migration . by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD pS910 F - actin Arp3 PKDpS910 Merge Merge PKD Cortactin Merge Figure 1 A B C D E F G H I 15 by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PKD1 - GFP F - actin Cortactin F G H I J GFP F - actin Cortactin A B C Merge D E Merge Figure 2A IP : α - Cortactin α - Cortactin α - GFP PKD1 - GFP Cortactin B C 80 kDA / 85 kDA 130 kDA α - GFP IP : α - GFP α - FLAG M2 PKD1 - GFP GFP Cortactin + + 130 kDA 95 kDA 26 kDA IP : α - FLAG M2 Cortactin α - FLAG M2 PKD1 α - GFP + + 130 kDA 95 kDA 16 FLAG - Cortactin FLAG - Cortactin by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m - 5 - 4 - 3 / - 2 - 1 L / I / V X R X S / T - 5 - 4 - 3 / - 2 - 1 L A K H E S S298 Consensus NTA 6 ½ HS1 repeats H P SH3 84 - 120 121 - 157 158 - 194 195 - 231 232 - 268 269 - 305 306 - 342 S298 N C Figure 3A C Pulldown : Ponceau Cortactin α - FLAG GST - 14 - 3 - 3 β α - FLAG Control blots : Cortactin 1 0 . 086 fold 95 kDA 95 kDA 60 kDA E α - PKD Pulldown : Ponceau α - Cortactin mAb Cortactin GST - 14 - 3 - 3 β PKD Control blots : 1 12 . 04 1 . 72 fold 80 kDA 85 kDA 95 kDA 60 kDA 17 B Cortactin reprobe : α - FLAG 95 kDA 95 kDA α - pS298Cortactin PKD1 α - PKD1 PKD2 α - PKD2 Tubulin α - Tubulin 105 kDA 110 kDA 55kDA + + Flag - Cortactin 1 0 . 47 fold 1 0 . 46 fold 1 0 . 23 fold PKD1 α - PKD1 PKD2 α - PKD2 Tubulin α - Tubulin Control blots : 105 kDA 110 kDA 55kDA pS298 - Cortactin Cortactin IP : Cortactin IB : α - pS298Cortactin 85 kDA 80 kDA 85 kDA 80 kDA reprobe : α− Cortactin IP : α - Cortactin D by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Figure 4 GFP - Vector PKD1 - GFP PKD1KD - GFP Cortactin - GFP CortactinS298A - GFP A v e r age nu m be r o f m i g r a t ed c e ll s / v i s ua l f i e l d ( 3 a ss a ys ) 137 . 0 42 . 17 340 . 3 92 . 83 386 . 2 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 18 by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Figure 5A C B S P S P Coomassie Cortactin Actin S P S P 72 95 55 43 Control : no F - actin Ratio : S / P : 1 . 64 S / P : 2 . 2 Input : 2 µ g purified Cortactin / 10 µ g F - actin F - buffer Pyrene - actin Pyrene - actin / Arp 50nM Pyrene - actin / Arp 50nM / VCA 400nM Pyrene - actin / Arp 50nM / VCA 400 nM / Cortactin 1000 nM Pyrene - actin / Arp 50nM / VCA 400 nM / CortactinS298A 1000nM Condition T½Max of saturation [ s ] ( Boltzmann curve fit ) F - buffer No fit Pyrene - actin 997 . 6 ± SE 7 . 40 Pyrene - actin / Arp 50nM 1043 ± SE 8 . 42 Pyrene - actin / Arp 50nM / VCA 400nM 488 . 8 ± SE 2 . 27 Pyrene - actin / Arp 50nM / VCA 400nM / Cortactin 394 . 9 ± SE 1 . 66 Pyrene - actin / Arp 50nM / VCA 400nM / CortactinS298A 343 . 2 ± SE 1 . 53 19 by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Figure 6A WAVE2 - GFP Arp3 Merge F - actin WAVE2 - GFP Arp3 Merge F - actin - FCS Heregulin 100ng / ml 10’ A B C D E F G H 20 by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Figure 6B WAVE2 - GFP F - actin Cortactin - FLAG Merge Merge WAVE2 - GFP F - actin CortactinS298A - FLAG Heregulin 100ng / ml 10’ Heregulin 100ng / ml 10’ A B C D E F G H 21 by gu e s t on J u l y 8 , 2020 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Figure 6C Overlay ROIs 1 ( Bleach ) 2 / 3 Sub - ROIs ;
