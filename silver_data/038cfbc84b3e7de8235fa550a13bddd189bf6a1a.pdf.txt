ABSTRACT Rab25 , a small GTPase belongs to the Rab protein family , has a pivotal role in cancer pathophysiology . Rab25 governs cell - surface receptors recycling and cellular signaling pathways activation , allowing it to control a diverse range of cellular functions , including cell proliferation , cell motility and cell death . Aberrant expression of Rab25 was linked to cancer development . Majority of research findings revealed that Rab25 is an oncogene . Elevated expression of Rab25 was correlated with poor prognosis and aggressiveness of renal , lung , breast , ovarian and other cancers . However , tumor suppressor function of Rab25 was reported in several cancers , such as colorectal cancer , indicating the tumor type - specific function of Rab25 . In this review , we recapitulate the current knowledge of Rab25 in cancer development and therapy . INTRODUCTION Rab25 ( Ras - related protein Rab - 25 ) belongs to the Rab protein family . Until now , 70 Homo sapiens Rab proteins have been identified [ 1 , 2 ] and they form the largest branch of the Ras superfamily [ 3 ] . Rabs are evolutionary conserved and their homologs are found in organisms ranging from yeast to human . Rabs are small GTPases involved in the control of vesicle trafficking . They govern correct transport of substances between different cellular compartments and have been implicated in various cellular functions , including cell proliferation , cell mobility , signal transduction and protein transport [ 4 , 5 ] . Since they are key regulators of major cellular functions , some of them have been reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression . For example , Rab5a and Rab7 were both up - regulated and have a higher degree of membrane association in autonomous thyroid adenomas [ 6 ] . Each Rab protein has different subcellular localization and controls specific membrane transport pathways [ 7 – 9 ] . Rab25 belongs to the Rab11 subfamily ( Rab11a , Rab11b , and Rab25 ) that regulates apical transport and / or recycle of vesicles to the plasma membrane [ 10 , 11 ] . Some Rab proteins are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues , whereas Rab25 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells . Rab25 functions either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor with a cancer type - dependent manner . It was predominantly reported to have oncogenic function and elevated expression in cancer , including ovarian cancer [ 12 , 13 ] , breast cancer [ 12 – 14 ] , renal cancer [ 15 , 16 ] , gastric cancer [ 17 ] , liver cancer [ 18 ] , non - small cell lung cancer [ 19 ] , bladder cancer [ 20 ] , glioblastoma multiforme [ 21 ] and prostate cancer [ 22 ] . Tumor suppressor function of Rab25 has also been found in several types of cancer , including colon cancer [ 23 ] , head and neck cancer [ 24 ] , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ 25 ] and oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [ 26 ] . The function of Rab25 in cancer is , therefore , multifactorial and tumor type - specific . This review recapitulates our current knowledge of the role of Rab25 in cancer , including the involvement of Rab25 in cancer prognosis , cancer progression , functional mechanisms and future research directions . Structure of Rab25 Structure and biological function of Rab25 Rab25 is a 23kDa small GTPase with general GTPase tertiary structure , a central barrel composed of a six - stranded b - sheet surrounded by a - helixs [ 27 ] . The control of vesicle trafficking is the major function of Rab proteins and was first reported by Salminen et al . [ 28 ] . The function of Rab25 is determined by two structural features , the guanine nucleotide binding motif and the carboxyl - Review Oncotarget 64592 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget terminus region . Guanine nucleotide binding motif allows Rab25 to bind with GTP / GDP , which controls the activity of Rab25 . The carboxyl - terminus of Rab25 contains CCXXX motif . Post - translational modification of the C - terminus determines the binding of Rab25 on specific vesicles and regulates the entire membrane trafficking process [ 4 , 29 ] . Each Rab protein recognizes and controls the transportation of different membrane vesicles . The C - terminus of Rab proteins contain XXXCC , XXCCX , XCCXX , CCXXX or XXCXC motif . Prenylation of the two cysteine residues at the motif , together with the addition of geranylgeranyl groups to one or two cysteine residues near the C - terminus , is required for tight binding of Rab proteins to their specific vesicles [ 30 – 32 ] . Post - translational modifications of the CCXXX motif of Rab25 allow the protein to bind to apical recycling endosomes and regulate recycle of the vesicles to the apical plasma membrane [ 11 ] . The Rab proteins cycle between two states , the GTP - bound active state and the GDP - bound inactive state ( Figure 1 ) . The inactive Rab proteins located in the cytosol and are recognized by guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP at the guanine nucleotide binding motif to form the active Rab proteins [ 33 ] . After coordinating the transport of vesicles to their destination , the active Rab proteins are converted back to the GDP - bound inactive form through hydrolysis of GTP , which is stimulated by a GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) [ 34 ] . The active GTP - bound Rab protein coordinates the entire 5 - step vesicle trafficking process , including vesicle sorting , uncoating , motility , tethering and fusion , by recruiting effector proteins for distinct membrane trafficking steps [ 35 ] . GTP - bound Rab proteins activate sorting adaptor to sort a receptor into a budding vesicle [ 36 ] . The active Rab proteins promote the vesicle uncoating through the recruitment of phosphoinostide ( PI ) kinases or phosphatases [ 37 ] . After that , the Rab proteins recruit motor adaptors to enhance vesicle transport along the cytoskeletal tracts ( actin filaments or microtubules ) [ 38 ] . When the vesicle cargos are transported to the destination membrane , Rab proteins mediate vesicle tethering by recruiting tethering factors that interact with molecules on the acceptor membrane . Those factors promote membrane fusion through their interaction with soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptors ( SNAREs ) [ 39 ] . Precise control of endocytic and exocytic trafficking of receptors and their ligands is essential in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways , which impact gene expression and biological functions . Since Rab25 is involved in the control of vesicle trafficking and signaling pathways , it is frequently reported to have altered expression in cancer [ 40 , 41 ] . Rab25 associated protein , FIP1C , was also reported to alter cancer progression [ 42 ] . Rab25 coordinated the recycling of α5β1 integrin vesicles and the activation of various signaling pathways . Down - stream effectors of Rab25 Current evidence suggested that Rab25 is predominantly an oncogene . It promotes oncogenic functions through the regulation of integrin recycling and intracellular signaling pathways ( Figure 2 ) . Direct interaction between Rab25 and α5β1 integrin was linked to increase tumor cell metastasis and aggressiveness [ 43 ] . Modified Rab25 , which does not interact with β1 integrin , did not promote cell invasion [ 43 ] . Active recycling of α5β1 integrin containing vesicle to the plasma membrane in the presence of Rab25 strongly promotes cell migration / invasion through 3D matrices [ 43 ] . Rab25 contributes to tumor progression by directing the localization of integrin - recycling vesicles and thereby enhancing the ability of tumor cells to invade the extracellular matrix . Nevertheless , it was found that Rab25 regulates integrin recycling no matter when it acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor . In the study of colorectal cancer , Rab25 acts as a tumor suppressor gene . Rab25 - deficient mice have more tumor formation and less β1 integrin recycled to the lateral membrane [ 44 ] . However , whether suppression of β1 integrin recycling contributed to reduction of tumor formation in Rab25 - deficient mice and the mechanisms involved have to be further investigated . Rab25 activates intracellular signaling pathways , including Akt , Wnt and Src pathways and suppresses apoptotic pathway . Ectopic overexpression of Rab25 increased phospho - Akt level , which may mediate the cell proliferation - stimulating effect of Rab25 on ovarian cancer cells [ 12 ] . Rab25 knockdown reduced phospho - Akt level , leading to the reduction of cell migration / invasion in bladder cancer cell [ 20 ] , hepatocellular carcinoma cells [ 45 ] and glioblastoma multiforme cells [ 21 ] . Rab25 knockdown or Akt inhibitor was found to reduce cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells [ 46 ] . Rab25 was reported to activate Wnt pathway . Depletion of Rab25 inhibited the expressions of Wnt pathway target genes , including cyclin D1 , c - Myc and MMP7 in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 45 ] . Rab25 promoted the expression of CLIC3 , which in turn activated Src signaling pathway [ 47 ] . Ectopic overexpression of Rab25 induced phospho - ERK1 / 2 , which is one of the downstream signaling molecules of Src , and may lead to cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer [ 48 ] . Knockdown of Rab25 reduced phospho - ERK1 / 2 level and promoted cell proliferation in breast cancer [ 49 ] . Moreover , Rab25 suppressed apoptotic cell death by reducing the expression of pro - apoptotic molecules , BAX and BAK , in ovarian cancer [ 12 ] . Knockdown of Rab25 was found to reduce anti - apoptotic protein , Bcl - 2 , in tobacco carcinogen - induced lung cancer [ 50 ] . Taken together , activation of growth - stimulating signaling pathways and suppression of apoptotic cell death pathways mediate the effect of Rab25 on enhancing cancer progression . Oncotarget 64593 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Up - stream regulators of Rab25 Altered expression of Rab25 is commonly observed in various types of cancer . However , the mechanisms leading to Rab25 expression alteration are not fully understood . Recently , altered Rab25 expression was reported to be associated with changes in microRNA expression , Rab25 gene copy number and epigenetic regulation . Elevated expression of several Rabs is due to downregulation of miRNAs . For example , up - regulation of Rab34 in gastric cancer is related to decreased expression of miR - 9 [ 51 ] . Increase of a series of Rab proteins , including Rab21 , Rab23 , Rab18 and Rab3B , is due to reduction of miR - 200b in breast cancer [ 52 ] . Li et al . has showed that Rab25 is a direct target of let - 7d , which is a down - regulated miRNA in renal cell carcinoma tissues as compared with the corresponding non - tumor tissues [ 16 ] . Copy number amplification is another cause of Rab25 up - regulation . Rab25 is encoded by RAB25 gene located at chromosome 1q22 . The minimum region of recurrent amplification at the 1q22 amplicon containing RAB25 was found in 54 % of advanced serous epithelial ovarian cancers by high - resolution array comparative genomic hybridization profiling [ 12 ] . Analysis of 21 epithelial ovarian cancers showed a direct relationship between copy number and expression of Rab25 , indicating mRNA overexpression of Rab25 is likely due to amplification of RAB25 gene [ 12 ] . The expression of Rab25 has been reported to be controlled by epigenetic regulation . Rab25 , an oncogene of ovarian cancer , shows a negative correlation between promoter methylation and mRNA expression [ 53 ] . In the study of ovarian cancer TCGA data set , decrease in Rab25 promoter methylation was associated with increase in Rab25 mRNA level , suggesting the elevation of Rab25 level by epigenetic regulation [ 53 ] . DNA methylation inhibitor was reported to induce Rab25 expression . The induction effect was further increased by co - treatment of DNA methylation inhibitor and histone deacetylases inhibitor in breast cancer cell [ 54 ] and lung squamous adenocarcinoma cells [ 55 ] , proofing the elevation of Rab25 level by promoter demethylation and acetylation . Epigenetic regulation also led to down - regulation of Rab25 in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OOSCC ) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) , in which Rab25 acts as a tumor suppressor . Figure 1 : Schematic diagram of Rab GTPase cycle . Rabs switch between two conformations , an inactive GDP - bound form and an active GTP - bound form . A guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) catalyzes the conversion from GDP - bound to GTP - bound and leads to activation of Rab . Activated Rab binds with specific effectors to promote vesicle trafficking . The inherent GTP hydrolysis of Rabs together with the enhancing effect of GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) leads to Rab inactivation . Conversion of Rabs to the inactive state leads to effector dissociation from the Rab protein . Oncotarget 64594 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Methylation status of Rab25 promoter was significantly higher and correlated with lower Rab25 mRNA levels in OOSCC by analyzing 147 OOSCC samples in TCGA database [ 26 ] . In ESCC , demethylation treatment and bisulfite genomic sequencing analyses revealed that down - regulation of Rab25 expression in both ESCC cell lines and clinical samples was associated with promoter hypermethylation [ 25 ] . Up till now , the cause of hypermethylation of Rab25 promoter when Rab25 acts as a tumor suppressor , and vice versa , remains elusive . Further investigation is needed to understand the epigenetic regulation mechanisms of Rab25 . Function of Rab25 Oncogenic function of Rab25 Rab25 is recognized to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression [ 56 ] . Rab25 was reported to initiate cancer formation , promote cell proliferation , suppress apoptotic cell death , enhance cell migration / invasion and increase drug resistance upon chemotherapy of various types of cancer [ 40 ] . The oncogenic function of Rab25 is likely due to its function on regulating vesicle trafficking . Rab25 increases integrin recycling to the plasma membrane and stimulating intracellular signaling pathways , which in turn regulates the oncogenic functions [ 41 ] . Tumorigenesis Recent reports indicated that Rab25 is related to transformed phenotype of neoplastic cells . Overexpression of Rab25 in non - transformed rat intestinal epithelial cells led to morphological and physiological transformation according to Lapierre et al . ’s report [ 57 ] . The transformed cells changed from circular to more spindle - shaped . They were found to grow in soft agar and formed tumors in immunocompromised mice . The transformed cells also demonstrated disruption of integrin - based focal adhesions and alteration in modified microtubule subsets , indicating the transformed phenotype is microtubule - dependent . Treatment with nocodazole , a microtubule polymerization inhibitor , reversed the transformed morphology and internalization of α5β1 - integrin [ 57 ] . Figure 2 : Overview of Rab25 functions in the cells . Rab25 regulates apical recycling of α5β1 integrin containing endosome . Suppressive effect of Rab25 on BAX and BAK leads to reduction of apoptotic cell death . Direct Rab25 / α5β1 integrin interaction and Rab25 induced activation of Akt , Src and Wnt pathways are associated with cell growth , metastasis and chemoresistance of cancer cells . Oncotarget 64595 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Cell growth / death and tumor development It has been demonstrated that Rab25 enhances cell proliferation and tumor development . Knockdown of Rab25 expression by siRNA / shRNA transfection inhibited in vitro cell growth of renal cell carcinoma cells ( 786 - O and A - 498 ) [ 16 ] , prostate cancer cells ( LNCaP ) [ 22 ] and hepatocellular carcinoma cells ( Bel7402 and SK - Hep - 1 ) [ 45 ] . Suppression of both in vitro cell growth and in vivo xenograft development were observed after knockdown of Rab25 in glioblastoma multiforme cells ( U87MG ) [ 21 ] and breast cancer cells ( MCF7 ) [ 58 ] . Knockdown of Rab25 was reported to inhibit tumor growth in tobacco carcinogen - induced lung cancer model [ 50 ] . Conversely , ectopic overexpression of Rab25 was found to induce in vitro cell growth of breast cancer cells ( MCF7 ) [ 12 , 58 ] and ovarian cancer cells ( A2780 , DOV13 , HEY , OCC1 ) [ 12 ] . Rab25 ectopic overexpression was found to increase development of xenograft derived from breast cancer cells ( MCF7 ) [ 58 ] and ovarian cancer cells ( A2780 , HEY ) [ 12 , 59 ] . In addition to promote cell growth , Rab25 inhibited apoptotic and autophagic cell death . Elevated expression of Rab25 decreased UV - induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer [ 12 ] . Knockdown of Rab25 was reported to increase apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells [ 60 ] and tobacco carcinogen - induced lung cancer model [ 50 ] . Moreover , Rab25 down - regulation was reported to induce autophagic cell death in ovarian cancer from two independent research studies [ 60 , 61 ] . The ability of Rab25 in cell growth stimulation and cell death suppression implicates the important role of Rab25 in supporting tumor growth . Cell migration / invasion and tumor metastasis Current reports indicated the involvement of Rab25 in promoting cell migration and invasion . Knockdown of Rab25 suppressed in vitro cell migration and cell invasion in renal cell carcinoma cells [ 16 ] , advanced non - small cell lung cancer cells [ 19 ] , prostate cancer cells [ 22 ] and glioblastoma multiforme cells [ 21 ] . Suppression of cell invasion after Rab25 knockdown was observed in gastric cancer cells [ 17 ] . The finding was further supported by Geng et al . ’s study , which showed that Rab25 depletion negatively regulated the invasion ability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [ 45 ] . In the study of bladder cancer , Rab25 knockdown not only suppress in vitro cell migration but also reduce in vivo tumor metastasis [ 20 ] . Tail vein injection of Rab25 knockdown bladder cancer cells ( EJ , T24 ) into immune - compromised mice has resulted in less tumor nodule formation in lung compared with the mice injected with parental bladder cancer cells [ 20 ] . Rab25 is , therefore , important in determining the metastatic ability of cancer cells . Chemoresistance Rab25 induces chemoresistance towards cisplatin , a first - line chemotherapeutic agent , commonly used in the treatment of patients with various types of cancer , such as advanced non - small cell lung cancer patients [ 62 , 63 ] , metastatic breast cancer [ 64 ] and ovarian cancer [ 65 ] . However , cisplatin resistance limits the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer patients [ 66 , 67 ] . Rab25 expression level was significantly higher in cisplatin - resistance A549 NSCLC cells when compared with the cisplatin - sensitive A549 cells [ 19 ] . Knockdown of Rab25 by siRNA transfection decreased cisplatin resistant of NSCLC cells [ 19 ] and ovarian cancer cells [ 46 ] . On the contrary , ectopic overexpression of Rab25 in A2780 ovarian cancer cells increased cisplatin resistance in in vitro cell culture [ 48 ] and in vivo i . p . tumor xenograft [ 59 ] , indicating the functional role of Rab25 in inducing cisplatin resistance in conventional chemotherapy . Tumor suppressor function of Rab25 Rab25 has tumor suppressor function in several types of cancer , including colorectal cancer , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [ 23 – 25 ] . Loss of Rab25 in human colon cancers was associated with poorer patient prognosis [ 44 ] . Rab25 deficiency promotes intestinal / colon adenoma formation in ApcMin / + mice [ 44 ] . The result was further supported by another Rab25 deficiency study in colon cancer [ 68 ] . Rab25 knockdown Caco2 - BBE colorectal cancer cells demonstrated twofold increase in the number of soft agar colonies formation and a significant increase in colony size than the control cell line [ 68 ] . Ectopic overexpression of Rab25 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma inhibited in vivo xenograft tumor development and angiogenesis [ 25 ] . In the study of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , Rab25 ectopic overexpression reduced in vitro cell invasion and in vivo tumor metastasis to cervical lymph node [ 24 ] . Dual character of Rab25 in cancer Rab25 has been reported to both enhance and suppress cancer progression . The role of Rab25 is cancer type - dependent . However , the mechanisms that lead to the discrepancies of Rab25 function remain elusive . One of the hypotheses suggested that the role of Rab25 depends on its ability to induce chloride intracellular channel protein 3 ( CLIC3 ) , which is involved in α5β1 integrin trafficking necessary for cancer cell invasion [ 47 ] . Pancreatic cancer patients with high Rab25 and high CLIC3 levels were associated with significantly shorter survival time . Conversely , patients with high Rab25 level and low CLIC3 levels predicted better clinical outcomes [ 47 ] . It is suggested that in the presence of CLIC3 , Rab25 acts as an oncogene , whereas , in the absence of CLIC3 , Rab25 acts as a tumor suppressor . When Rab25 acts as an oncogene , Rab25 enhances α5β1 integrin recycling to the plasma membrane , leading to increase in cancer progression of ovarian cancer [ 43 ] . When Rab25 acts as a tumor suppressor , Rab25 - deficiency reduced β1 integrin recycling to the plasma membrane and decreased tumor formation in colorectal adenocarcinomas [ 44 ] . Oncotarget 64596 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Future research direction Clinical implication of Rab25 in cancer A large majority of clinicopathological findings indicate the oncogenic role of Rab25 in cancer . Elevated expression of Rab25 was significantly associated with shorter survival time of patients with bladder cancer [ 20 ] , advanced non - small cell lung cancer [ 19 ] , ovarian cancer [ 12 ] , breast cancer [ 12 , 49 ] , clear cell renal cell carcinoma [ 15 ] and prostate cancer [ 22 ] . It is indicated that Rab25 is a potential prognostic marker for patients with various types of cancer . Rab25 is up - regulated among the 52 Rab GTPases analyzed in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) according to Li et al . ’s study [ 16 ] . High Rab25 expression level was significantly correlated with high invasion classification , lymph - node metastasis and pathological stage in RCC [ 16 ] . Moreover , high level of Rab25 expression was associated with lymph node / distant metastasis in bladder cancer [ 20 ] , prostate cancer [ 22 ] , gastric cancer [ 17 ] and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 45 ] , suggesting the involvement of Rab25 in promoting tumor metastasis . The role or Rab25 in promoting cancer metastasis is confirmed by in vitro experiments in which knockdown of Rab25 decreased cell migration and invasion of 786 - O and A - 498 RCC cells [ 16 ] . Rab25 expression was associated with response rate of cisplatin - based chemotherapy of advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients . The cisplatin - based chemotherapy response rate of NSCLC patients with Rab25 - positive expression was 30 % , as opposed to 52 % for patients with Rab25 - negative expression [ 19 ] . Elevated expression of Rab25 may be due to amplification of RAB25 gene located in chromosome 1q22 . Amplification of RAB25 was reported to associate with markedly decreased disease - free survival or overall survival in ovarian cancer in Cheng et al . ’s study [ 12 ] . Their report indicated an increase ( at least 1 . 3 - fold ) in DNA copy number in a 1 . 1 - Mb region located on chromosome 1q22 ( which contain RAB25 gene ) in 28 of 52 ( 54 % ) of advanced serous epithelial ovarian cancers . Ovarian cancer patients with elevated RAB25 amplification either did not enter a disease free state following surgery and chemotherapy or showed very short disease - free survival , implicating RAB25 as potential driver gene correlated with poor prognosis and aggressive behavior of ovarian cancer [ 12 ] . Rab25 is predominantly an oncogene , but it also acts as tumor suppressor in certain types of cancer . Lower expression of Rab25 correlated with significantly shorter survival time of patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas [ 44 ] and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) [ 25 ] . In the study of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OOSCC ) , lower Rab25 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis status [ 26 ] . Conclusion and future research direction Rab25 GTPase regulates crucial biological functions and is important in maintaining proper function of cells . Biological and clinicopathological findings revealed that alteration of Rab25 level has high impact on cancer progression and patient survival . Rab25 may act as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor . Rab25 overexpression and gene copy number amplification was reported in various types of cancer . Elevated expression of Rab25 correlated with poor prognosis and tumor metastatic potential of cancer patients , suggesting Rab25 is a potential marker for cancer progression . Rab25 enhances cell growth , cell migration / invasion , chemoresistance and in vivo tumor growth . The mechanisms for Rab25 to regulate oncogenic functions involved the control of extracellular receptors recycling and intracellular signaling pathways , including Akt , Wnt , Src and apoptotic pathways . Further investigation on the mechanisms for Rab25 mediated oncogenic functions is important for the development of novel therapeutic strategies or inhibitors targeting Rab25 . Moreover , it is important to identify the mechanisms that lead to copy number amplification of RAB25 in order to find out the potential methods for cancer prevention . The function of Rab25 differs greatly in different types of cancer . The mechanisms that lead to the tumor suppressing function of Rab25 have not been fully understood . CLIC3 expression level was reported to be an important factor in determining the function of Rab25 . In pancreatic cancer , Rab25 acts as an oncogene in the presence of CLIC3 , whereas , Rab25 acts as a tumor suppressor in the absence of CLIC3 [ 47 ] . The correlation of Rab25 / CLIC3 expression and clinical outcome in different types of cancer has to be investigated . In addition , the downstream mechanisms activated by Rab25 when it acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor are not yet clear . When Rab25 acts as an oncogene , Rab25 enhances α5β1 integrin recycling to the plasma membrane , leading to increase in cancer progression of ovarian cancer [ 43 ] . When Rab25 acts as a tumor suppressor , Rab25 - deficiency reduced β1 integrin recycling to the plasma membrane and decreased tumor formation in colorectal adenocarcinomas [ 44 ] . In - depth study is needed to find out the downstream effectors that mediate the distinct function of Rab25 in cancer . Taken together , better understanding of Rab25 function under different circumstances , together with development of Rab25 specific targeting agents , will be required for development of novel therapeutic strategy targeting Rab25 in cancer treatment .
