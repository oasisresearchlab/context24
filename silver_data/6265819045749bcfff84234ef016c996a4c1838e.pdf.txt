Yet , many 22 factors that characterize its transmissibility remain unclear , including mechanistic correlates of 23 overdispersion , viral kinetics , the extent to which respiratory droplets and aerosols carry viable 24 virus and the infectiousness of asymptomatic , presymptomatic and pediatric cases 7 . Here , we 25 developed a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads ( rVLs ) via systematic review and 26 investigated these factors using meta - analyses and modeling . By comparing cases of COVID - 19 , 27 SARS and influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 , we found that heterogeneity in rVL was associated with 28 overdispersion and facilitated the distinctions in individual variation in infectiousness among 29 these emergent diseases . For COVID - 19 , case heterogeneity was broad throughout the infectious 30 period , although rVL tended to peak at 1 day from symptom onset ( DFSO ) and be elevated for 1 - 31 5 DFSO . While most cases presented minimal risk , highly infectious ones could spread SARS - 32 CoV - 2 by talking , singing or breathing , which shed virions at comparable rates via droplets and 33 aerosols . Coughing shed considerable quantities of virions , predominantly via droplets , and 34 greatly increased the contagiousness of many symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones . 35 Asymptomatic and symptomatic infections showed similar likelihoods of expelling aerosols with 36 SARS - CoV - 2 , as did adult and pediatric cases . Children tended to be less contagious by droplet 37 spread than adults based on tendencies of symptomatology rather than rVL . Our findings address 38 longstanding questions on SARS - CoV - 2 transmissibility and present pertinent considerations for 39 disease control . 40 .

While the basic reproductive number has been estimated to be 2 - 3 . 6 1 , 2 , 44 transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 is highly overdispersed , with numerous instances of 45 superspreading 9 - 11 and few cases ( 10 - 20 % ) causing many secondary infections ( 80 % ) 4 - 6 . 46 Estimates indicate 40 - 87 % of cases are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic , which facilitates 47 transmission 2 , 3 , 12 . Infectiousness begins around - 3 to - 2 DFSO and has been estimated to last 8 - 48 10 DFSO 13 - 15 . Hence , the temporal infectiousness profile of COVID - 19 resembles that of 49 influenza 16 , whereas its overdispersion is similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome 50 ( SARS ) 17 . 51 For respiratory virus transmission , airway epithelial cells shed virions to the extracellular 52 fluid before atomization ( from breathing , talking , singing , coughing and aerosol - generating 53 procedures ) partitions them into a polydisperse mixture of droplets ( > 5 μm ) and aerosols ( ≤5 54 μm ) that are expelled to the ambient environment 7 . Based on mass , droplets tend to settle 55 gravitationally , whereas aerosols remain suspended and travel based on airflow profiles . 56 Although proximity has been associated with infection risk for COVID - 19 18 , studies have also 57 suggested that long - range aerosol spread occurs conditionally 9 - 11 . 58 Despite these analyses , key factors that characterize the transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 59 remain unclear . To investigate many of these factors , we synthesized evidence by systematic 60 review , compared SARS - CoV - 2 rVLs among subgroups , associated overdispersion , analyzed 61 viral kinetics and modeled the likelihood of shedding viable virus via droplets and aerosols 62 across respiratory activities , DFSO , case heterogeneity and subgroups .

The systematic search ( Supplementary Tables 1 - 5 ) identified 4 , 274 results . After 72 screening and full - text review , 63 studies met the inclusion criteria and were used for analysis 73 ( Fig . 1 ) ( n = 9 , 692 total specimens ) , which included adult ( n = 5 , 124 ) and pediatric ( n = 1 , 593 ) cases 74 and measurements for asymptomatic ( n = 2 , 378 ) , presymptomatic ( n = 28 ) and symptomatic 75 ( n = 7 , 231 ) infections . According to a hybrid Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist , 76 risk of bias was low to moderate for included studies ( Extended Data Table 1 ) . 77 78 Meta - analysis and subgroup analyses of rVL 79 For each study in the systematic dataset , we used specimen concentrations to estimate rVLs 80 ( Methods ) . We then performed a random - effects meta - analysis ( Extended Data Fig . 1 ) , which 81 showed that , during the infectious periods , the expected rVL of SARS - CoV - 2 was comparable to 82 that of SARS - CoV - 1 ( p = 0 . 148 , two - sided Welch’s t - test ) but lesser than that of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 83 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . We also performed random - effects subgroup analyses for COVID - 19 ( Fig . 2 ) , which 84 showed that expected SARS - CoV - 2 rVLs were consistent between pediatric and adult cases 85 ( p = 0 . 861 ) and between symptomatic / presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections ( p = 0 . 951 ) . 86 .

As an empirical 91 estimate , k depends on myriad extrinsic ( behavioral , environmental and invention ) and host ( host 92 defenses ) factors . However , since dispersion is similar across distinct outbreaks of a virus 17 , we 93 hypothesized that an intrinsic virological factor mediates k for these emergent respiratory 94 infections . 95 We assessed heterogeneity in rVL . For all three viruses , rVLs best conformed to Weibull 96 distributions ( Extended Data Fig . 2 ) , and we fitted the entirety of individual sample data for each 97 virus in the systematic dataset ( Fig . 3a , Extended Data Fig . 2n ) . While COVID - 19 and SARS 98 cases tended to shed lesser virus than those with A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( Extended Data Fig . 1 ) , broad 99 heterogeneity in rVL inverted this relationship for highly infectious individuals ( Extended Data 100 Fig . 3a - c ) . At the 90 th case percentile ( cp ) , the estimated rVL was 8 . 91 ( 8 . 82 - 9 . 00 , 95 % 101 confidence interval [ CI ] ) log 10 copies / ml for SARS - CoV - 2 , whereas it was 8 . 62 ( 8 . 47 - 8 . 76 ) log 10 102 copies / ml for A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 . Moreover , heterogeneity in rVL was similar among adult , 103 pediatric , symptomatic / presymptomatic and asymptomatic COVID - 19 cases ( Extended Data Fig . 104 3d - g ) , with standard deviations ( SDs ) of 2 . 01 - 2 . 06 log 10 copies / ml ( Extended Data Table 2 ) . 105 To investigate the relationship between k and heterogeneity in rVL , we performed a meta - 106 regression using each included study ( Fig . 3b ) . The analysis showed a negative association 107 ( p = 0 . 031 , meta - regression slope t - test ) , indicating that heterogeneity in rVL intrinsically 108 facilitated the distinctions in overdispersion among the emergent infections . 109 .

The 113 outputs indicated that , on average , each productively infected cell in the airway epithelium shed 114 SARS - CoV - 2 at 1 . 11 ( 0 . 51 - 1 . 71 , 95 % CI ) copies / ml day - 1 and infected up to 10 . 6 susceptible 115 cells ( Extended Data Table 3 ) . The turnover rate for infected epithelial cells was 0 . 55 ( 0 . 23 - 0 . 87 ) 116 days - 1 , while the half - life of SARS - CoV - 2 in the respiratory tract was 4 . 35 ( 2 . 23 - 97 . 8 ) hours . By 117 extrapolating the model to an initial rVL of 0 - 1 log 10 copies / ml , the estimated incubation period 118 was 5 . 38 - 4 . 52 days , which agrees with epidemiological findings 1 . Conversely , the expected 119 duration of shedding was 26 . 8 DFSO . Thus , SARS - CoV - 2 replicated exponentially in the 120 respiratory tract based on a mean rate constant of 4 . 02×10 - 7 ( 3 . 01×10 - 7 - 5 . 03×10 - 7 ) ( copies / ml ) - 1 121 day - 1 after infection . Around 1 DFSO , rVL peaked , as the number of infected epithelial cells 122 reached equilibrium , and then diminished exponentially . 123 As SARS - CoV - 2 rVLs showed widespread heterogeneity across the infectious period , we 124 fitted distributions for each DFSO ( Fig . 3d ) , which showed that high rVLs also increased from 125 the presymptomatic period before decreasing towards the end of the first week of illness . At the 126 90 th cp , SARS - CoV - 2 rVL peaked at 1 DFSO at 9 . 83 ( 9 . 12 - 10 . 61 ) log 10 copies / ml , an order of 127 magnitude greater than the overall 90 th - cp estimate ( Extended Data Table 2 ) . The estimate 128 remained ≥9 . 33 log 10 copies / ml between 1 - 5 DFSO . At - 1 DFSO , the 90 th - cp rVL was 8 . 30 129 ( 6 . 88 - 10 . 02 ) log 10 copies / ml , while it was 7 . 92 ( 7 . 34 - 8 . 55 ) log 10 copies / ml at 10 DFSO 130 ( Extended Data Fig . 3h - s ) . 131 132 .

To calculate 135 an unbiased estimator of partitioning ( the expected number of viable copies per particle ) , our 136 method multiplied rVL estimates with the volumes of atomized particles and an assumed 137 viability proportion of 0 . 1 % after dehydration ( Methods ) . 138 When expelled by the mean COVID - 19 case across the infectious period , respiratory 139 particles showed minimal likelihoods of carrying viable SARS - CoV - 2 ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Aerosols 140 ( dehydrated aerodynamic diameter [ d a ] ≤5 µm ) were < 0 . 001 % likely to contain a virion . Droplets 141 also had low likelihoods : at d a = 40 µm , they were ≤0 . 4 % likely to contain a virion . 142 COVID - 19 cases with high rVLs , however , expelled particles with considerably greater 143 likelihoods of carrying viable copies ( Fig . 4a , b ) . For the 98 th cp at 1 DFSO , 18 . 2 % ( 8 . 8 - 27 . 6 % ) 144 of aerosols ( d a = 5 µm ) contained at least one SARS - CoV - 2 virion . For d a > 14 . 4 µm , droplets were 145 > 99 % likely to contain virions , with large ones carrying tens to hundreds . 146 147 Shedding SARS - CoV - 2 via respiratory activities 148 Using the partitioning estimates in conjunction with published profiles of the particles expelled 149 by respiratory activities ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) , we modeled the rates at which talking , singing , 150 breathing and coughing shed viable SARS - CoV - 2 across d a ( Fig . 4c - f ) . Among the non - 151 presenting activities , singing emitted virions most rapidly followed by talking and then 152 breathing , although talking loudly was similar to singing ( Extended Data Fig . 4c , d ) . These 153 activities produced more aerosols than droplets , but particle size correlated with the likelihood of 154 containing virions . Thus , talking , singing and breathing shed SARS - CoV - 2 at similar rates via 155 .

In comparison , coughing shed far greater quantities of virions 157 ( Fig . 4f ) , of which > 99 . 9 % were carried by droplets . 158 We further examined the influences of case heterogeneity and disease course on expelling 159 SARS - CoV - 2 ( Fig . 4h , Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . The estimated total shedding rates ( over all 160 particle sizes ) for a respiratory activity spanned ≥8 . 55 orders of magnitude on each DFSO ; 161 cumulatively from - 1 to 10 DFSO , they spanned 11 . 2 orders of magnitude . Hence , most cases 162 expelled a negligible number of SARS - CoV - 2 virions by talking , singing or breathing . Shedding 163 occurred most rapidly at 1 DFSO : for the 98 th cp , singing discharged 31 . 5 ( 3 . 26 - 379 , 95 % CI ) 164 virions / min to the ambient environment , while talking emitted 4 . 67 ( 0 . 48 - 56 . 1 ) virions / min and 165 breathing exhaled 1 . 27 ( 0 . 13 - 15 . 2 ) virions / min ; these estimates were two orders of magnitude 166 greater than those for the 86 th cp . For the 98 th cp at - 1 DFSO , singing shed 1 . 31 ( 0 . 01 - 406 ) 167 virions / min and breathing exhaled 5 . 24×10 - 2 ( 5 . 28×10 - 4 - 16 . 3 ) virions / min . The estimates at 7 - 10 168 DFSO were comparable to these presymptomatic ones ( Fig . 4h , Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . 169 At 1 DFSO , coughing expelled 2 . 13×10 6 ( 2 . 20×10 5 - 2 . 56×10 7 ) virions / cough for the 98 th cp , 170 90 . 4 ( 24 . 6 - 372 ) virions / cough for the 50 th cp and 2 . 66 ( 0 . 65 - 13 . 1 ) virions / cough for the 25 th cp 171 ( Extended Data Fig . 5c ) . At - 1 and 10 DFSO , these estimates were reduced by ~ 2 orders of 172 magnitude . Thus , most symptomatic cases shed considerable quantities of SARS - CoV - 2 by 173 coughing ; a single cough accounted for the virions emitted by weeks of singing for a case . 174 As indicated by similar mean rVLs ( Fig . 2 ) and heterogeneities in rVL ( Extended Data 175 Table 2 ) , asymptomatic , symptomatic / presymptomatic , adult and pediatric COVID - 19 cases 176 showed similar profiles for total shedding rates ( Extended Fig . 6a - d ) . The estimates showed that 177 the top 6 . 1 % , 2 . 4 % and 1 . 1 % of pediatric cases shed ≥1 virion / min by singing , talking and 178 .

In general , highly infectious 179 COVID - 19 cases expelled virions more rapidly than did ones with A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( Extended 180 Data Fig . 6f ) . 181 182 Discussion 183 This study provided comprehensive , systematic analyses of several factors characterizing the 184 transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 . First , we evaluated the influence of heterogeneity in rVL . Our 185 findings show that broad heterogeneity in rVL facilitates greater variation in individual 186 infectiousness in the COVID - 19 pandemic than was found in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic . For each 187 respiratory activity , SARS - CoV - 2 shedding rates span > 11 orders of magnitude throughout the 188 infectious period . While most COVID - 19 cases present minimal transmission risk by talking , 189 singing or breathing , highly infectious ones , including asymptomatic and presymptomatic 190 infections , can spread SARS - CoV - 2 through these activities . Our model estimates , when 191 corrected to copies rather than virions , align with recent clinical findings for exhalation rates of 192 SARS - CoV - 2 24 . Moreover , the findings suggest that heterogeneity in rVL may be a virological 193 factor generally associated with overdispersion for respiratory infections . In this case , rVL 194 distribution may serve as an early correlate for transmission patterns , including superspreading , 195 during outbreaks of novel respiratory viruses , providing insight for disease control before large - 196 scale epidemiological analyses empirically characterize k . 197 Second , we analyzed SARS - CoV - 2 kinetics during respiratory infection . While 198 heterogeneity remains broad throughout the infectious period , the systematic dataset indicates 199 that rVL tends to peak at 1 DFSO and be elevated for 1 - 5 DFSO , coinciding with the period of 200 highest attack rates observed among close contacts 25 . These results indicate that transmission risk 201 .

Furthermore , our kinetic analysis 204 suggests that , on average , SARS - CoV - 2 reaches diagnostic concentrations 1 . 60 - 3 . 22 days after 205 respiratory infection ( - 3 . 78 to - 2 . 16 DFSO ) , assuming assay detection limits of 1 - 3 log 10 206 copies / ml , respectively , for nasopharyngeal swabs immersed in 1 ml of transport media . 207 Third , we modeled the likelihood of shedding SARS - CoV - 2 via aerosols . Talking , singing 208 and breathing shed SARS - CoV - 2 at comparable rates through droplets and aerosols ( up to tens to 209 hundreds of virions / min ) . As airborne spread is recognized as a key mode of transmission for 210 A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 20 , our model estimates and comparative analyses support , particularly for highly 211 infectious cases , airborne spread as a transmission mode for SARS - CoV - 2 . While our models 212 delineated aerosols from droplets at the classical threshold ( d a = 5 µm ) , recent reports show that , 213 based on emission vectors and environmental conditions , respiratory particles larger than 5 µm 214 can also travel > 2 m in air 28 , 29 , further supporting the plausibility of the airborne transmission of 215 SARS - CoV - 2 . However , with short durations of stay in well - ventilated areas , the concentration , 216 and exposure risk , of aerosols remains correlated with proximity to infectious cases 18 , 28 . 217 Fourth , we assessed the relative infectiousness of COVID - 19 subgroups . Since rVL 218 distributions are similar among subgroups and the predominant source of aerosols is the non - 219 presenting respiratory activities ( talking , singing and breathing ) , symptomatic and asymptomatic 220 infections present similar risks for aerosol spread , as do adult and pediatric cases . However , most 221 cases shed considerable numbers of virions via large droplets by coughing , a common symptom 222 of COVID - 19 30 . Thus , symptomatic infections tend to be significantly more contagious than 223 asymptomatic ones , providing a reason as to why asymptomatic cases transmit SARS - CoV - 2 at 224 .

Accordingly , children ( 48 - 54 % of symptomatic cases present with cough ) 32 , 33 tend to be 226 less contagious by droplet spread than adults ( 68 - 80 % ) 30 , 33 based on tendencies of 227 symptomatology rather than rVL . 228 Our study has limitations . The systematic search found a limited number of studies reporting 229 quantitative specimen measurements from the presymptomatic period , meaning these estimates 230 may be sensitive to sampling bias . Although additional studies have reported semiquantitative 231 metrics ( cycle thresholds ) , these data were excluded because they cannot be compared on an 232 absolute scale due to batch effects 34 , limiting use in compound analyses . Furthermore , our 233 analyses considered population - level estimates of the infectious periods and viability 234 proportions , which omit individual variation in the dynamics of virus viability . Some patients 235 shed SARS - CoV - 2 with diminishing viability soon after symptom onset 13 , while others produce 236 replication - competent virus for weeks 35 . It remains unelucidated how case characteristics and 237 environmental factors affect the viability dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 . 238 Taken together , our findings provide a potential path forward for disease control . They 239 highlight the disproportionate role of high - risk cases , settings and circumstances in propelling 240 the COVID - 19 pandemic . Since highly infectious cases , regardless of age or symptomatology , 241 can rapidly shed SARS - CoV - 2 via both droplets and aerosols , airborne spread should also be 242 recognized as a transmission risk , including for superspreading . Strategies to abate infection 243 should limit crowd numbers and duration of stay while reinforcing distancing and then 244 widespread mask usage ; well - ventilated settings can be recognized as lower risk venues . 245 Coughing sheds considerable quantities of virions for most infections , while rVL tends to peak at 246 1 DFSO and can be high throughout the infectious period . Thus , immediate , sustained self - 247 .

Other than the title of 391 this study , we have followed PRISMA reporting guidelines 36 . The systematic review was 392 conducted according to Cochrane methods guidance 37 . 393 The search included papers that ( i ) reported positive , quantitative measurements ( copies / ml 394 or an equivalent metric ) of SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV - 1 or A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 in human 395 respiratory specimens ( ETA , NPA , NPS , OPS , POS and Spu ) from COVID - 19 , SARS or 396 A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 cases ; ( ii ) reported data that could be extracted from the infectious periods of 397 SARS - CoV - 2 ( defined as - 3 to + 10 DFSO for symptomatic cases and 0 to + 10 days from the day 398 of laboratory diagnosis for asymptomatic cases ) , SARS - CoV - 1 ( defined as 0 to + 20 DFSO or the 399 equivalent asymptomatic period ) or A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( defined as - 2 to + 9 DFSO for symptomatic 400 cases and 0 days to + 9 days from the day of laboratory diagnosis for asymptomatic cases ) ; and 401 ( iii ) reported data for two or more cases with laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 , SARS or 402 A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 . Quantitative specimen measurements were considered after RNA extraction for 403 diagnostic sequences of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Ofr1b , N , RdRp and E genes ) , SARS - CoV - 1 ( Ofr1b , N 404 and RdRp genes ) and A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( HA and M genes ) . 405 Studies were excluded , in the following order , if they ( i ) studied an ineligible disease ; ( ii ) 406 had an ineligible study design , including those that were reviews of evidence ( e . g . , scoping , 407 systematic , narrative ) , did not include primary clinical human data , reported data for less than 408 two cases due to an increased risk of selection bias , were incomplete ( e . g . , ongoing clinical 409 trials ) , did not report an RNA extraction step before measurement or were studies measuring 410 .

We included 417 data from control groups receiving standard of care in interventional studies but excluded data 418 from the intervention group . Patients in the intervention group are , by definition , systematically 419 different from general case populations because they receive therapies not being widely used for 420 treatment , which may influence virus concentrations . Interventional studies examining the 421 comparative effectiveness of two or more treatments were excluded for the same reason . Studies 422 exclusively reporting semiquantitative measurements ( e . g . , Ct values ) of specimen concentration 423 were excluded , as these measurements are sensitive to batch inconsistencies and , without proper 424 calibration , cannot be compared on an absolute scale across studies 34 . 425 We searched , without the use of filters or language restrictions , the following sources : 426 MEDLINE ( via Ovid , 1946 to 7 August 2020 ) , EMBASE ( via Ovid , 1974 to 7 August 2020 , 427 Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( via Ovid , 1991 to 7 August 2020 ) , Web of 428 Science Core Collection ( including : Science Citation Index Expanded , 1900 to 7 August 2020 ; 429 Social Sciences Citation Index , 1900 to 7 August 2020 ; Arts & Humanities Citation Index , 1975 430 to 7 August 2020 ; Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science , 1990 to 7 August 2020 ; 431 Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Sciences & Humanities , 1990 to 7 August 2020 ; 432 and Emerging Sources Citation Index , 2015 to 7 August 2020 ) , as well as MedRxiv and BioRxiv 433 .

Topol , Akiko Iwasaki and A . Marm Kilpatrick on Twitter ) and by 437 hand - searching through journals ( Nature , Nat . Med . , Science , NEJM , Lancet , Lancet Infect . Dis . , 438 JAMA , JAMA Intern . Med . and BMJ ) . A comprehensive search was developed by a librarian , 439 which included subject headings and keywords . The search strategy had 3 main concepts 440 ( disease , specimen type and outcome ) , and each concept was combined using the appropriate 441 Boolean operators . The search was tested against a sample set of known articles that were pre - 442 identified . The line - by - line search strategies for all databases are included in Supplementary 443 Tables 1 - 5 . The search results were exported from each database and uploaded to the Covidence 444 online system for deduplication and screening . 445 Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts , reviewed full texts , collected data 446 and assessed risk of bias via Covidence and a hybrid critical appraisal checklist based on the 447 Joanna Briggs Institute ( JBI ) tools for case series , analytical cross - sectional studies and 448 prevalence studies 38 - 40 . To evaluate the sample size in a study , we used the following calculation : 449 ! ∗ = # " $ % " , ( 1 ) 450 where ! ∗ is the sample size threshold , # is the z - score for the level of confidence ( 95 % ) , $ is the 451 standard deviation ( assumed to be 3 log 10 copies / ml , one quarter of the full range of rVLs ) and % 452 is the marginal error ( assumed to be 1 log 10 copies / ml , based on the minimum detection limit for 453 qRT - PCR across studies ) 41 . The hybrid JBI critical appraisal checklist is shown in the 454 Supplementary Notes . Inconsistencies were resolved by discussion and consensus . 455 .

Hospitalized cases were defined as those being tested in a hospital 462 setting and then admitted . Non - admitted cases were defined as those being testing in a hospital 463 setting but not admitted . Community cases were defined as those being tested in a community 464 setting . Symptomatic , presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections were defined as in the study . 465 Based on rare description in the included studies , paucisymptomatic infections , when defined in 466 a study , were included with symptomatic ones . Pediatric cases were defined as those of 18 years 467 of age or lower or as defined in the study . Adult cases were defined as those above 18 years of 468 age or as defined in the study . 469 470 Meta - analysis of rVLs 471 Based on the search design and composition of included studies , the meta - analysis overall 472 estimates were the expected SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV - 1 and A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 rVL when 473 encountering a COVID - 19 , SARS or A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 case , respectively , during their infectious 474 period . To determine rVLs , data collected on positive , quantitative specimen measurements were 475 converted to the RNA concentration in the respiratory tract . Viral concentrations in respiratory 476 specimens were denoted as specimen measurements , whereas viral concentrations in the 477 respiratory tract were denoted as rVLs . For example , measurements from swabbed specimens 478 .

Based on the 479 expected uptake volume for swabs ( 0 . 128 ± 0 . 031 ml , mean ± SD ) 103 or reported collection 480 volume for expulsed fluid in each study ( e . g . , 0 . 5 to 1 ml ) along with the reported volume of 481 transport media in each study ( e . g . , 1 ml ) , we calculated the dilution factor for each respiratory 482 specimen to estimate the rVLs . If the diluent volume was not reported , then the dilution factor 483 was calculated assuming a volume of 1 ml ( NPS and OPS ) , 2 ml ( POS and ETA ) or 3 ml ( NPA ) 484 of transport media 43 , 45 , 71 . Unless dilution was reported for Spu specimens , we used the specimen 485 measurement as the rVL 13 . The non - reporting of diluent volume was noted as an element 486 increasing risk of bias in the hybrid JBI critical appraisal checklist . Viral load estimates ( based 487 on instrumentation , calibration , procedures and reagents ) are not standardized . While the above 488 procedures ( including only quantitative measurements after extraction , collecting assay detection 489 limits , correcting for specimen dilution ) have considered many of these factors , non - 490 standardization is an inherent limitation in interpreting specimen measurements across studies . 491 Pooled estimates and 95 % CIs for the expected rVL of each virus across their infectious 492 period were calculated using a random - effects meta - analysis . The estimates for rVL assumed 493 that each viral copy was extracted and quantified from the tested specimen aliquot . For studies 494 reporting summary statistics in medians and interquartile or total ranges , we derived estimates of 495 the mean and variance and calculated the 95 % CIs 104 . All calculations were performed in units of 496 log 10 copies / ml . Between - study heterogeneity in meta - analysis was assessed using the I 2 and τ 2 497 statistics .

The overall estimate for each subgroup was the expected rVL when 504 encountering a case of that subgroup during the infectious period . Studies reporting data 505 exclusively from a subgroup of interest were included in the analysis without modification . For 506 studies in which data for these subgroups constituted only part of its dataset , rVLs from the 507 subgroup were collected to calculate the mean , variance and 95 % CIs . All calculations were 508 performed in units of log 10 copies / ml . In the analysis , we excluded studies with only a single case 509 in our subgroups of interest . Pooled estimates and 95 % CIs for each subgroup were calculated 510 using a random - effects meta - analysis , in which between - study heterogeneity was assessed using 511 the I 2 and τ 2 statistics . The weighting for each study in its subgroup was calculated as the 512 reciprocal of the rVL variance . 513 514 Distribution of rVL 515 To analyze heterogeneity in rVLs , we pooled the entirety of individual sample data ( reported as 516 individual specimen measurements rather through descriptive statistics ) in the systematic dataset 517 by disease , COVID - 19 subgroups and DFSO . For analyses of SARS - CoV - 2 dynamics across 518 DFSO , we included estimated rVLs from negative qRT - PCR measurements of respiratory 519 specimens ( n = 3 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 15 , 13 , 17 and 14 negative specimens for 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 520 DFSO , respectively ) for cases that had previously been quantitatively confirmed to have 521 COVID - 19 . These rVLs were estimated based on the reported assay detection limit in the 522 respective study . Probability plots and modified Kolmogorov – Smirnov tests were used to 523 determine the suitability of normal , lognormal , gamma and Weibull distributions to describe the 524 .

For each virus , the 525 data best conformed to Weibull distributions , which is described by the probability density 526 function 527 * ( + ) = , - . + - / # $ % 0 $ ( ' / ) ) ! , ( 2 ) 528 where , is the shape factor , - is the scale factor and + is rVL ( + ≥ 0 log 10 copies / ml ) . In this 529 distribution , the value of the rVL at the 4 th percentile was determined using the quantile function , 530 + + = - [ − ln ( 1 − 4 ) ] % / # . ( 3 ) 531 For cp curves , we used eq . ( 3 ) to determine rVLs from the 1 st cp to the 99 th cp ( step size , 1 % ) . 532 Curve fitting to eq . ( 2 ) and calculation of eq . ( 3 ) and its 95 % CI was performed using the 533 Distribution Fitter application in Matlab R2019b ( MathWorks , Inc . , Natick , Massachusetts , 534 USA ) . 535 536 Meta - regression of k and heterogeneity in rVL 537 To assess the relationship between k and heterogeneity in rVL , we performed a univariate meta - 538 regression ( log > = ? ( @ A ) + C , where ? is the slope for association and C is the intercept ) 539 between pooled estimates of k ( based on studies describing community transmission ) for 540 COVID - 19 ( k = 0 . 409 ) 4 - 6 , 105 - 108 , SARS ( k = 0 . 165 ) 17 and A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( k = 8 . 155 ) 22 , 23 and the SD 541 of the rVLs in each study . Since the negative binomial distribution , from which k is derived 17 , is 542 analogous to a compound Poisson distribution in which each random variable is Log ( > ) - 543 distributed , the meta - regression was performed with log > . Based on negligible between - study 544 heterogeneity , we used a fixed - effects model . This analysis assumes that the SD of rVLs in each 545 study estimates SD of rVL for the disease . Thus , for weighting in the meta - regression , we used 546 the proportion of rVL samples for each study relative to the entire systematic dataset ( E , = 547 .

The regression line , its 95 % CI and its Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) were 548 presented along with the p - value for association ( meta - regression slope t - test for ? ) between the 549 two variables . The meta - regression assumed that the viability proportion ( for viruses exiting the 550 respiratory tract ) was similar across cases for a given respiratory infection ; it could be a different 551 value for different diseases . The meta - regression also assumed that the rate profile of particles 552 expelled by respiratory activities ( e . g . , talking ) is similar among the diseases . The limit of 553 detection for qRT - PCR instruments used in the included studies did not significantly affect the 554 analysis of heterogeneity in rVL , as these limits tended to be below the values found for 555 specimens with low virus concentrations . 556 557 Viral kinetics 558 To model the kinetics of SARS - CoV - 2 rVL , we used a mechanistic epithelial cell - limited model 559 for the respiratory tract 109 , based on the system of differential equations : 560 % G % H = − - GI ( 4 ) 561 % K % H = - GI − LK ( 5 ) 562 % I % H = NK − OI , ( 6 ) 563 where G is the number of uninfected target cells , K is the number of productively infected cells , I 564 is the rVL , - is the infection rate constant , N is the rate at which airway epithelial cells shed virus 565 to the extracellular fluid , O is the clearance rate of the virus and L is the clearance rate of 566 productively infected cells . Parameter units are summarized in Extended Data Table 3 . Using 567 these parameters , the viral half - life in the respiratory tract ( H % / " = ln 2 / O ) and the half - life of 568 productively infected cells ( H % / " = ln 2 / L ) and their 95 % CIs could be estimated .

( 4 ) - ( 6 ) were simplified according to a quasi - steady state 574 approximation 110 to 575 % G % H = − - GI ( 8 ) 576 % I % H = TGI − LI , ( 9 ) 577 where T = N - / O , for a form with greater numerical stability . The system of differential equations 578 was fitted on the mean estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 rVL between - 2 and 10 DFSO using the 579 entirety of individual sample data in units of copies / ml . Numerical analysis was implemented 580 using the Fit ODE app in OriginPro 2019b ( OriginLab Corporation , Northampton , 581 Massachusetts , USA ) via the Runge - Kutta method and initial parameters I 1 , K 1 and G 1 of 4 582 copies / ml , 0 cells and 5×10 7 cells , respectively , for the range - 5 to 10 DFSO . The analysis was 583 first performed with eqs . ( 8 ) - ( 9 ) . These output parameters were then used to initialize final 584 analysis using eqs . ( 4 ) - ( 6 ) , where the estimates for - and L were input as fixed and variable 585 parameters , respectively . The fitted line and its coefficient of determination ( r 2 ) were presented . 586 To estimate the average incubation period , we extrapolated the kinetic model to 0 and 1 587 log 10 copies / ml pre - symptom onset . To estimate the average duration of shedding , we 588 extrapolated the model to 0 log 10 copies / ml post - symptom onset . Unlike experimental estimates , 589 this estimate for duration of shedding was not defined by assay detection limits . These analyses 590 had limitations .

The average time from respiratory infection to 594 reach diagnostic levels was then calculated by subtracting these values from the incubation 595 period for 0 log 10 copies / ml . However , the extrapolated time for SARS - CoV - 2 to reach 596 diagnostic concentrations in the respiratory tract should be validated in tracing studies , in which 597 contacts are prospectively subjected to daily sampling . 598 599 Considerations for particle dehydration 600 The desiccation time of a particle in air was described H 456 = C $ % ( % 7 " − % 456 " ) , where C is 601 prefactor for dehydration rate which depends on the environmental conditions , % 7 is the initial 602 hydrated diameter and % 456 is particle diameter after desiccation 111 . After desiccation , the 603 remaining non - volatile matter ( ions , molecules , viruses and cells ) governs particle size , which is 604 approximately 0 . 44 times the initial size of particles atomized in the respiratory tract 112 . 605 Dehydrated aerodynamic diameter was calculated by % 9 = % : ( V / V 1 ) % / " , where % : is the 606 dehydrated particle size , V is the material density of the respiratory particle and V 1 is the 607 reference material density ( 1 g / cm 3 ) . For conservative estimates , the value of b was taken to be 608 64 . 9 µm 2 / s 113 based on conditions of room temperature and a relative humidity of 59 % ( near the 609 upper limit of 60 % for healthcare and typical indoor specifications ) 114 . The equation for 610 desiccation time indicated that respiratory particles begin to dehydrate immediately upon release 611 to the ambient environment . Desiccation occurred rapidly , as the equation estimated that an 11 . 4 - 612 µm particle desiccated to 5 µm in 1 . 6 s within the model conditions , and this value was an upper 613 limit for the desiccation times of aerosols ( H 456 ≤ 1 . 6 s ) . 614 .

The model assumed [ was 0 . 1 % for the 623 viruses . For influenza , approximately 0 . 1 % of copies in particles expelled from the respiratory 624 tract represent viable virus 115 , which is equivalent to one in 3 log 10 copies / ml for rVL or , after 625 dilution in transport media , roughly one in 4 log 10 copies / ml for specimen concentration . Recent 626 reports have detected culture - positive respiratory specimens with SARS - CoV - 2 concentrations 627 down to 4 log 10 copies / ml 13 , including from pediatric patients 62 and in the presymptomatic 628 period 15 , suggesting the assumption was also suitable for SARS - CoV - 2 . 629 Likelihood profiles were determined using Poisson statistics , as described by the probability 630 mass function 631 P ( ] = > ) = X < 0 $ = > ! , ( 11 ) 632 where > is the number of virions partitioned within the particle . For X , 95 % CIs were determined 633 using the variance of its rVL estimate . To determine 95 % CIs for likelihood profiles from the 634 probability mass function , we used the delta method , which specifies 635 Varbc ( d ) e ≈ $ " ċ ( d ) ′iċ ( d ) , ( 12 ) 636 .

For the univariate 637 Poisson distribution , $ " i = X and 638 ċ ( j ) = X < $ % 0 $ = > ! ( > − X ) . ( 13 ) 639 Based on the relative relationship between the residence time of expelled particles before 640 assessment ( ~ 5 s ) 116 in the referenced study 115 and the estimated dehydration rates of expelled 641 particles , we took the viability proportion ( 0 . 1 % ) to be for dehydrated particles . The model 642 calculated partitioning of copies using the hydrated volume and then applied the viability 643 proportion for number of virions in particles after emission and dehydration . Thus , we compared 644 likelihoods among expelled , dehydrated particles . In Fig . 4 , the comparison between hydrated 645 and dehydrated diameters showed only the relationship in particle size and not the relationship in 646 likelihood of containing viable virus . Based on the scope of the study , the model did not account 647 for the virion half - life as particles deposit onto surfaces or remain suspended in air 117 . 648 649 Rate profiles of particles expelled by respiratory activities 650 For the rate profiles of particles expelled during respiratory activities , we used distributions from 651 the literature . For coughing , we considered the rate ( particles / cough ) of expelling particles at 652 different sizes , as determined by Loudon and Roberts 118 , by calculating the mean number of 653 respiratory particles expelled per cough based on subject tests RI , RII , LI , LII and EI ( EII was 654 presumed to be an outlier based on the relative rate when compared to EI ) . These particles were 655 taken to be dehydrated based on the deposition time in the experiment relative to estimated 656 dehydration rates . We compared this rate profile to that of Duguid 119 , which were taken to be 657 hydrated particles based on experimental design . For talking , singing and breathing , we obtained 658 data from Morawaska et al 120 . Rate profiles ( particles / min ) were calculated by converting the 659 .

Rate profiles of talking and singing were isolated from 662 breathing by subtracting the contribution of breathing to the combined data . Particles were taken 663 to be dehydrated based on the minimum particle age in the measurements . Based on the APS 664 used , the analyzed range for d a was 0 . 3 - 20 μm . While larger droplets may potentially be expelled 665 by the respiratory activities , the data suggested that their emission rates were minimal , and there 666 was a limited bias associated with instrumentation . We compared these data for talking with rate 667 profiles of talking loudly and talking quietly from Asadi et al 121 . For data reported in a size 668 channel , we took the particle size to be the median value . Curves based on discrete particle 669 measurements were connected using the nonparametric Akima spline function . 670 671 Shedding virions via respiratory droplets and aerosols 672 To determine the respiratory shedding rate across particle size , rVL estimates and the hydrated 673 diameters of particles expelled by a respiratory activity were input into eq . ( 10 ) , and the output 674 was then multiplied by the rate profile of the activity ( talking , singing , breathing or coughing ) . 675 Dehydration and viability considerations were continued from the likelihood models . The model 676 used particle profiles from ( coughing ) Loudon and Roberts 118 or ( talking , singing and breathing ) 677 Morawaska et al 120 . 678 To determine the total respiratory shedding rate for a given respiratory activity across cp , we 679 determined the cumulative hydrated volumetric rate ( by summing the hydrated volumetric rates 680 across particle sizes for that respiratory activity ) and input it into eq .

Since the Poisson mean was proportional to cumulative volumetric rate , this estimate of 687 the relative contribution of aerosols and droplets to respiratory viral shedding was consistent 688 among viruses and cps in the model . 689 In this study , the model for shedding virions via droplets and aerosols did not delineate 690 particles generated in the upper respiratory tract from those generated in the lower respiratory 691 tract , as the sites of atomization remain poorly understood . It also did not differentiate cases with 692 significant expectoration from those without it . In addition , it did not account for individual 693 variation in the profiles of expelled particles ; superemitters can expel respiratory particles at 694 rates ~ 3 times above median 121 . 695 696 Statistical analysis 697 For data collection , statistical analysis , coding and data visualization , we used Excel v16 . 40 698 ( Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , Washington , USA ) , OriginPro 2019b ( OriginLab 699 Corporation , Northampton , Massachusetts , USA ) and Matlab R2019b ( MathWorks , Inc . , Natick , 700 Massachusetts , USA ) . Between - study heterogeneity in the random - effects meta - analyses was 701 assessed using the I 2 and τ 2 statistics . Probability plots for normal , lognormal , gamma and 702 Weibull distributions of rVLs were scored based on the Blom method . Modified Kolmogorov - 703 Smirnov tests were used to determine the goodness of fits between rVLs ( in log 10 copies / ml ) and 704 .

By accepting the null hypothesis in the 705 modified Kolmogorov – Smirnov test , the given distribution cannot be rejected to fit the data . 706 Based on fitted Weibull distribution parameters , the Weibull quantile function was used to 707 determine the rVL and its 95 % CIs at a given cp . The association between k and rVL was 708 assessed via meta - regression , and the p - value for association was based on the meta - regression 709 slope t - test . Likelihood profiles were determined using the Poisson probability mass function and 710 the unbiased estimator for the expected partitioning of virions at a given particle size . Variance 711 on likelihood estimates was determined via the delta method . Since case variance or sample size 712 may be unequal among the viral infections or subgroups , the two - sided Welch’s t - test was used 713 to compare the difference of expected rVLs in the meta - analysis and subgroup analyses .
