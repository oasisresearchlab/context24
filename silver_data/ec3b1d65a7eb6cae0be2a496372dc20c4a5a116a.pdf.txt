One of the earliest marks of the cognitive revolution in psychology was a re - vival of interest in consciousness , as opposed to behavior . To a large degree , the cognitive psychology which emerged immediately after World War II to replace functional behaviorism was marked by an interest in the span of ap - prehension , primary memory , attention , and imagery . Now , as we approach the 21st century , cognitive psychology has begun to deal seriously with un - conscious mental life , and the notion of the psychological unconscious : the idea that conscious experience , thought , and action is influenced by per - cepts , memories , and other mental states which are inaccessible to pheno - menal awareness and somehow independent of voluntary control . The Cognitive Unconscious and Beyond In the modern history of cognitive psychology , one can discern four early stages in our conceptualization of the psychological unconscious ( Kihlstrom , 1995b , 1998a ) . ( 1 ) The first of these might be called the wastebasket view : Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 2 | P a g e that the unconscious is comprised of events that are unattended and unre - hearsed , and memories that have been lost through decay or displacement . ( 2 ) There is also the file cabinet view : that the unconscious is comprised of memories that are passively stored , and must be actively retrieved into short - term or working memory in order to play any role in cognitive processing . Note that neither view allows unconscious percepts , thoughts , and memories to be dynamically active . Thus , they do not really satisfy the definition of the psychological unconscious . ( 3 ) A more active role for the unconscious appears in the notion of preattentive processing , which holds that stimulus events are subject to unconscious processes of feature detec - tion , pattern recognition , and the like before conscious attention is directed to them . ( 4 ) An even more active role is suggested by the idea of automatic - ity - - the notion that some cognitive and motoric skills , once executed deli - berately , may become automatized through extensive practice - - after which we have no direct introspective access to these procedures or their opera - tions . These ideas allow unconscious processes to play a role in cognition , but they imply that the psychological unconscious is limited to mental processes , and that the contents on which these processes operate are con - scious . Implicit Memory The idea that mental contents might be unconscious , and not just the processes that operate on them , is commonly associated with psychoanalytic theory . But , as Ellenberger ( 1970 ) has shown , ideas about unconscious per - cepts and memories have a history that extends far back beyond Brewer and Freud ' s ( 1893 - 1895 / 1955 ) studies of hysteria . And in contemporary psy - chology it has been revived in the distinction between explicit and implicit memory ( Schacter , 1987 ) . Explicit memory refers to the conscious recollec - tion of some past event , as in recall and recognition . By contrast , implicit memory refers to any effect of a past event on a person ' s ongoing expe - rience , thought , and action , regardless of whether that event can be con - sciously remembered . Perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the difference between explicit and implicit memory comes from studies of patients who have suffered bila - teral damage to the medial temporal lobes ( including the hippocampus ) or diencephalon ( including the mammillary bodies ) . These patients show a gross anterograde amnesia , as evidenced by their general inability to recall Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 3 | P a g e or recognize words that have been presented to them for study . But when asked to perform other tasks , they frequently give evidence of the preserva - tion of some sort of memory . The first investigators to document this under controlled conditions were Warrington and Weiskrantz ( 1968 ) , who found relatively normal retention when the patients were tested with fragments or stems of list items . Thus , after studying a word like ELASTIC , amnesics will be unable to recall or recognize it ; but when presented with the stem ELA - - , and encouraged to fill in the blanks , they are more likely to produce ELASTIC than ELATED . This phenomenon has now come to be known as a priming ef - fect , and it has been demonstrated many times . When amnesic patients , who cannot remember words from a study list , are later given an opportuni - ty to use those same words in another sort of task , they show an advantage for previously studied items as opposed to unstudied neutral items - - an ad - vantage similar in magnitude to that displayed by neurologically intact con - trols . Dissociations between explicit and implicit memory can be observed in other forms of amnesia as well , including posthypnotic amnesia ( Dorfman & Kihlstrom , 1994 ; Kihlstrom , 1980 ) , surgical anesthesia ( for reviews , see Cork , Couture , & Kihlstrom , 1997 ; Kihlstrom , 1993b ; Kihlstrom & Schacter , 1990 ; Merikle & Daneman , 1996 ) , and the amnesias associated with electro - convulsive therapy ( Dorfman , Kihlstrom , Cork , & Misiaszek , 1995 ; Squire , Shimamura , & Graf , 1985 ) and multiple personality disorder ( for reviews , see Kihlstrom & Schacter , 1995 ; Kihlstrom , Tataryn , & Hoyt , 1993 ) , so the effect is quite commonly observed . Implicit memory is also spared in normal aging , which has deleterious effects on explicit memory ( e . g . , Light & Singh , 1987 ; Light , Singh , & Capps , 1986 ; for a review , see Schacter , Kihlstrom , Kaszniak , & Valdiserri , 1993 ) . Dissociations between explicit and implicit memory can be observed even in normal subjects run under normal laboratory conditions ( for a review , see Roediger & McDermott , 1990 ) . Thus , subjects can show savings in relearning items which they can neither recall nor recognize from a previous study trial ( Nelson , 1978 ) . Priming effects are unaffected by variables , such as depth of processing during encoding , that profoundly affect conscious recollection ( e . g . , Jacoby & Dallas , 1981 ) . The study of implicit memory in normal sub - jects , especially as represented by repetition priming , is now a major enter - prise within cognitive psychology ( for reviews of this literature , see ; Graf & Masson , 1993 ; Lewandowsky , Dunn & Kirsner , 1989 ; Roediger & McDermott , Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 4 | P a g e 1990 ) . At the same time , the explicit - implicit distinction has also been ex - tended to other domains of cognition ( Kihlstrom , 1987 , 1990 , 1998a ) . Implicit Learning Perhaps the most familiar of these extensions ( and one that actually pre - dates the explicit - implicit distinction in memory ) is the phenomenon of im - plicit learning , or the acquisition of new patterns of behavior in the absence of awareness of the patterns themselves ( for reviews , see Adams , 1957 ; Berry & Dienes , 1993 ; Dienes & Berry , 1997 ; Kihlstrom , 1996a ; Neal & Hesketh , 1997 ; Reber , 1993 ; Seger , 1994 ) . Implicit learning has been dem - onstrated by Reber ' s ( 1967 ) work on artificial grammars , in which subjects who have been exposed to letter strings generated according to a complex rule system can classify new instances appropriately , even though they can - not articulate the rules that define the category ; Lewicki ( 1986 ) has reported conceptually similar experiments involving social categorization and judg - ment . Similarly , experiments on the control of complex systems show that subjects can learn to manipulate inputs in order to make control outputs , without being able to articulate the relations between them ( e . g . , Berry & Broadbent , 1984 ) . Finally , it appears that subjects can acquire the ability to predict forthcoming events without being able to specify the underlying se - quential structure they have obviously learned ( e . g . , ( Lewicki , Czyzewska , & Hoffman , 1987 ; Nissen & Bullemer , 1987 ) . Razran ( 1961 ) reported that sub - jects could acquire interoceptive conditioned responses without being aware of either the conditioned or unconditioned stimuli ( see also Papka , Ivry , & Woodruff - Pak , 1996 ) . In all these cases , and others , subjects have appar - ently learned without being aware of what they have learned . In stark contrast to implicit memory , claims for implicit learning have been highly controversial ( Adams , 1957 ; Dulany , 1997 ; Shanks & St . John , 1994 ) . Reber ( 1967 , 1993 ) , has defined implicit learning as abstract , automatic , and unconscious , and all three assertions have been seriously questioned by critics . Although questions concerning automaticity and representation are both interesting , in the present context only awareness is relevant , and here it must be admitted that the available evidence is not completely satisfying . For example , while most subjects in artificial grammar learning cannot arti - culate the entire Markov process by which the grammatical strings have been generated ( Reber , 1967 ) , it is also true that above - chance classifica - tion performance could result from consciously accessible knowledge of legal Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 5 | P a g e letters , letter positions , or bigrams . Perhaps the best evidence on the posi - tive side is that the subjects experience themselves as behaving randomly . In artificial grammar learning the relationship between accuracy and confi - dence is very weak ( Dienes , Altman , Kwan , and Goode , 1995 ) , while in se - quence learning subjects rate their accurate predictions as guesses ( Willing - ham , Greeley , & Bardone , 1993 ) . Implicit Perception A somewhat more recent extension of the explicit - implicit distinction is to perception . By analogy to implicit memory , we can define implicit perception in terms of the effects of a current event ( or an event in the very recent past ) on performance , in the absence of conscious perception of that event ( Kihlstrom , 1996a ; Kihlstrom , Barnhardt , & Tataryn , 1992a ) . Implicit per - ception includes what has been known as subliminal perception , precons - cious processing , or detectionless processing , as illustrated by priming ef - fects involving weak , brief , or masked stimulus presentations ( e . g . , Green - wald Klinger , & Liu , 1989 ; Marcel , 1983 ; Merikle & Reingold , 1990 ; Pierce & Jastrow , 1885 ) . It also covers priming effects observed in experiments in - volving parafoveal vision ( e . g . , Bargh & Petromonaco , 1982 ; Underwood , 1976 ) and dichotic listening ( Eich , 1984 ) . In each of these cases , the prim - ing is produced by stimuli which can be construed as somehow degraded be - low some level required for conscious perception . During the recent history of psychology , claims for subliminal perception have been very controversial ( e . g . , Bruner & Klein , 1960 ; Dixon , 1971 , 1981 ; Eriksen , 1960 ; Holender , 1986 ; Shanks & St . John , 1994 ) , but the effect has now been demonstrated under conditions that should satisfy all but the most incorrigible critics ( Greenwald , Klinger , & Liu , 1989 ; Greenwald , Klinger , & Schuh , 1995 ; Greenwald , Draine , & Abrams , 1996 ) . It should be noted , however , that tru - ly subliminal processing seems to be analytically limited to very perceptual and very simple semantic analyses ( Greenwald , 1992 ; Kihlstrom , 1993a , 1996a ) . However , subliminal perception does not exhaust the category of implicit perception effects . This is because priming and similar effects can be ob - served under conditions that are not easily classified as subliminal . A neuro - logical case in point is blindsight ( Weiskrantz , 1986 ) : patient D . B . , can make accurate judgments about the visual properties of objects which he cannot see ; another is neglect resulting from temporoparietal damage ( Bisiach , Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 6 | P a g e 1993 ; Rafal , 1998 ) : In at least some cases , the patient ' s behavior and judgments can be influenced by stimuli presented in the neglected portion of the visual field ( Marshall & Halligan , 1988 ) . Similar effects are observed in the functional anesthesias , such as " hysterical " blindness , associated with conversion disorder ( e . g . , Brady and Lind , 1961 ; Bryant & McConkey , 1989b ) , and in some phenomena of hypnosis , such as suggested blindness ( Bryant & McConkey , 1989a ) and deafness ( Spanos , Jones , & Malfara , 1982 ) . in these cases , the stimuli in question are clearly supraliminal : and despite the fact that they are not consciously perceived , they clearly influ - ence the subject ' s experience , thought , and action . For this reason , Kihlstrom et al . ( 1992a ) preferred the term " implicit " to " subliminal " percep - tion , to underscore the central role of the subject ' s phenomenal awareness , as opposed to stimulus properties : the subjects are perceiving while una - ware of what they are perceiving . Implicit perception is typically revealed by the same sorts of tasks employed in studies of implicit memory , with the dif - ference that in implicit memory , the events in question were consciously perceived at the time they occurred . On these grounds , then , preserved priming following general anesthesia ( Cork et al . , 1997 ) might well be classi - fied as a case of implicit perception rather than implicit memory . Implicit Thought After memory , learning , and perception , the catalog of cognition comes na - turally to thought . Although James ( 1890 ) characterized unconscious thought as a contradiction in terms , evidence for implicit thought is mount - ing ( Dorfman , Shames , & Kihlstrom , 1994 ; Kihlstrom , Shames , & Dorfman , 1996 ) . Again by analogy to implicit memory , implicit thought may be said to occur where a thought - - for example , the correct solution to a problem - - influences experience , thought , or action , in the absence of awareness of the thought itself . Implicit thoughts may consist of ideas , beliefs , or images - - any cognitive content , in fact , which is neither a percept ( a representation of a current event ) or a memory ( a representation of a past event ) ; and they appear to be closely associated with the experiences of intuition , incubation , and insight which are hallmarks of creative problem solving . The notion of implicit thought is exemplified by the research of Bowers and his associates , who showed how the correct solution to a difficult problem can influence choice behavior , even though the subject is not consciously aware of the solution itself ( Bowers , 1984 ; Bowers , Farvolden , & Mermigis , Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 7 | P a g e 1995 ; Bowers , Regehr , Balthazard , & Parker , 1990 ) . Their research involved an adaptation of the Remote Associates Test ( Mednick , 1962 ) , in which sub - jects are presented with two word triplets , one coherent and one incoherent . For the coherent triplet , the items are all associatively related to a single word ( e . g . , playing , credit , report - - card ) , while for the incoherent triplet , there is no such relation ( e . g . , still , pages , music ) . The subject ' s task is to in - spect both triplets , and give the solution to the coherent triplet ( the target ) ; if they cannot do so , they are to indicate which triplet is coherent . Bowers et al . ( 1990 , Experiment 1 ) found that subjects could discriminate between co - herent and incoherent triplets at better than chance levels , even when they could not name the target . They further suggested that the subjects ' choices reflected information processing outside of phenomenal awareness - - some - thing like the buildup of activation spreading from semantic memory nodes representing the elements of the coherent triplet to a node representing the target . In support of this idea , Shames ( 1994 ) found that unsolved but co - herent triplets primed lexical decisions concerning their respective targets . Other experiments also show that , in the absence of awareness of the cor - rect answer , subjects ' intuitions about problems , choices , and judgments are not merely random guesses . For example , Bowers et al . ( 1990 , Experiment 2 ) also showed that subjects could discriminate between picture fragments that could , when properly assembled , represent familiar objects and those that could not - - even though they were unable to tell what the objects were . Durso and his colleagues were able to trace changes in cognitive structure as subjects approached the solution to a problem , even though they had not reached the solution itself ( Durso , Rea , and Dayton , 1994 ) . And Bechara and colleagues found that subjects ' skin - conductance res - ponses , and choice behaviors , differentiated between advantageous and dis - advantageous decks of cards in a gambling game , even though they could not describe the difference between " good " and " bad " decks ( Bechara , Da - masio , Damasio , & Anderson , 1994 ; Bechara , Damasio , Tranel , & Damasio , 1997 ; Bechara , Tranel , Damasio , & Damasio , 1996 ) . These sorts of results converge on the proposition that thoughts , in the form of ideas , images , bi - ases , and the like , can guide behavior even when we are unaware of them .

But cognition is not all there is to mental life . At least since the 19th century , many psychologists and philosophers of mind and have classi - fied mental life into three broad faculties , including emotion and motivation as well as cognition ( for a review , see Hilgard , 1980 ) . This idea began with Christian Wolfe ( 1679 - 1754 ) who brought the term psychology into common use , and who classified the mind into the facultas cognoscitova ( knowledge ) and the facultas appetiva ( desire ) . Moses Mendelsohn ( 1729 - 1786 ) added affect ( emotion ) to the list . The tripartite classification of mental faculties was consolidated by the philosopher Immanuel Kant ( 1724 - 1804 ) , who wrote in his Critique of Judgment ( 1790 ) that " there are three absolutely ir - reducible faculties of the mind , namely , knowledge , feeling , and desire " ( Watson , 1888 , p . 311 ) . By this statement , Kant meant that emotion and motivation each have an existence that is in some sense independent of cognition , and of each other . This position which contrasts with the idea , still popular in psychology , that emotional and motivational states are cognitive constructions - - i . e . , that they are beliefs about what one feels ( Schacter & Singer , 1962 ) or wants ( Lepper , Greene , & Nisbett , 1973 ) . Kant ' s idea of three independent mental faculties is reflected in what Hilgard ( 1980 ) has called " the trilogy of mind " : cognition , the mental representation of reality through perception , attention , learning , memory , and thought ; emotion , the subjective experience of arousal , pleasure , and displeasure , and their ex - pression in behavior ; and motivation , the activation of behavior and its di - rection toward a goal . All three of these mental states enter into the deter - mination of behavior . We usually think of the cognitive , emotional , and motivational processes that underlie action in terms of conscious mental states . We are aware of what we think , feel , and desire ; and we act accordingly . But we have already con - cluded that cognitive states , such as percepts , memories , and thoughts can affect behavior outside of awareness . If it makes sense to say that cognitive states of perception , memory , and thought can be unconscious , or implicit , it makes sense to ask whether emotional states can be unconscious , or impli - cit , as well .

One possibility is that it resembles Sigmund Freud ' s vision of unconscious mental life ( for a detailed analysis of Freud ' s theory of psychoanalysis , see Macmillan , 1996 ) . Freud ( 1916 - 1917 / 1963 , 1933 / 1964 ) argued that people are affected by emotional or motivational states of which they are not consciously aware . Later on , when they reflect on their behavior ( or perhaps after they have undergone psy - choanalysis ) , they realize what their true feelings and motives are . But when that happens , the insight has the character of an inference , rather than an introspection , and they were never consciously aware of their feelings or de - sires at the time they acted on them . So , the classic Freudian defense me - chanisms ( A . Freud , 1936 / 1966 ; S . Freud , 1926 / 1959 ) all are designed to render the person unaware of his or her true emotions . In reaction forma - tion , we profess love but really feel hate ; in displacement , we declare hatred of one person , when we really hate another person entirely ; in intellectuali - zation and rationalization , our behavior is stripped of all of its emotional connections entirely . Freud argued that our true emotions were manifest in our behavior , even if they were not represented in consciousness . Suppes and Warren ( 1975 ) have proposed a mathematical model of the kinds of transformations involved in the Freudian defense mechanisms . They begin with a propositional representation of unconscious affect - - of an ac - tor , an action , and an object ( x ) of the action - - as in the prototypical Freu - dian emotional self - disclosure : I ( actor ) love ( action ) my mother ( object x ) . They then go on to show that some 44 different defense mechanisms , in - cluding all those included in the standard list , can be produced by just eight transformations applied to the actor , the action , or the object , alone or in combination - - e . g . , the transformation of self to other , of an action into its opposite , or from object x to object y . Thus , displacement retains the original actor and action , but changes the ob - ject from x to y : I love my father . In reaction formation , the actor and object remain constant , but the action is changed into its opposite : I hate my mother . In projection , the action and the object remain constant , but the ac - tor is changed : Saddam Hussein loves my mother . Applying all three trans - Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 10 | P a g e formations , we obtain Saddam Hussein hates my father - - a glib and vulgar Freudianism , to be sure , but one which nicely illustrates the essential process by which the defense mechanisms are held to operate so as to rend - er the actual emotional and motivational determinants of our behavior inac - cessible to phenomenal awareness . Of course , one does not have to embrace the whole conceptual panoply of classical ( or even neofreudian ) psychoanalysis - - the division of the mind in - to id , ego , and superego , the theory of infantile sexuality , the stages of psy - chosexual development , repression , and whatnot . And one certainly doesn ' t have to trace all of one ' s emotional life to primitive sexual and aggressive instincts . The kinds of emotions whose conscious representations are at is - sue can be represented by the everyday concepts of folk psychology , as re - flected in the affect circumplex ( Russell , 1980 ; Watson & Tellegen , 1985 ) , Murray ' s ( 1938 ) list of needs , and similar ideas . In the present context , what is important in Suppes and Warren ' s ( 1975 ) model is that it suggests two basic ways in which the emotional unconscious can be expressed - - ( 1 ) when the original emotion is represented consciously but we are unconscious of the source of that emotion , as in displacement and projection ; and ( 2 ) where the emotion itself is denied conscious representation , as in reaction formation , intellectualization , and denial . Emotion as an Expression of Implicit Cognition One element of the emotional unconscious is that a person may be con - sciously aware of his or her emotional state , yet unaware of its source in current or past experience . This is the sort of thing the Roman poet and epi - grammatist Martial had in mind , when he wrote ( Epigrammata , Book 1 , No . 32 , freely translated by the 17th - century English satirical poet Thomas Brown ; see Hayward , 1927 ) : Non amo te , Sabidi , nec possum dicere quare : hoc tantum possum dicere , non amo te . I do not love you Dr . Fell , but why I cannot tell ; But this I know full well , I do not love you , Dr . Fell It is also what Brewer and Freud ( 1893 - 1895 / 1955 ) had in mind in their Studies on Hysteria : Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 11 | P a g e Hysterics suffer mainly from reminiscences . [ But In ] the great majority of cases it is not possible to establish the point of origin by a simple interroga - tion of the patient , however thoroughly it may be carried out . . . principally because he is genuinely unable to recollect it and often has no suspicion of the causal connection between the precipitating event and the pathological phenomenon . For Breuer and Freud ' s unconscious ( or repressed ) memories , we can substi - tute implicit ones ( for a fuller discussion , see Kihlstrom , 1997b ) . Viewed in this way , a conscious emotional state may serve as an index of implicit per - ception or memory . Even though the emotional states themselves are con - sciously experienced , these phenomena of implicit perception and memory deserve to be counted in the emotional unconscious . Emotion as an Expression of Implicit Memory In a classic demonstration of what we have now come to call spared implicit memory in organic amnesia , Claparede ( 1911 / 1951 ) pricked an unsuspect - ing Korsakoff ' s syndrome patient with a pin hidden in his hand - - an event that caused her quite a bit of distress . Claparede subsequently left the room , and returned after the patient had regained her composure . Upon question - ing , she failed to recognize Claparede , and had no recollection of the unfor - tunate incident that had just transpired between them . Nevertheless , she re - fused to shake his hand . When asked why , she replied , " Sometimes people hide pins in their hands " . The story illustrates the phenomenon of source amnesia familiar in studies of memory ( see Kihlstrom , 1995a ) . But assuming that the prospect of shaking hands made the patient nervous as well , it sug - gests a dissociation between conscious awareness of an emotional state , which she probably experienced , and conscious recollection of the origins of that state in experience , which she evidently did not . In a case of hysterical somnambulism reported by Janet ( 1893 , 1904 ; see Nemiah , 1979 ) , Madame D . suffered a breakdown after some men jokingly deposited her drunken husband on her doorstep and announced that he was dead . Afterward , the woman had no conscious recollection of the event . But whenever she passed by her front door , she froze with terror . Moreover , she complained of dreams in which her husband was brought home dead . Here again , we have an emotional state - - terror , and distress about the dreams - Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 12 | P a g e - and emotional behavior - - freezing , as well as the nightmares ; but no awareness of why they occur . A third example comes from a case of phobia for running water reported by Bagby ( 1928 ) . The patient had no memory of the circumstances under which this intense emotional reaction had been acquired . However , the mystery was solved when the patient was visited by an aunt who said , as an aside , " I have never told " . It turned out that the patient , as a child , had gone on a picnic with the aunt ; and , as children are wont to do , she had disobeyed in - structions , strayed into a nearby creek , and become trapped under a water - fall . The child was rescued by the aunt , who promised to keep her transgres - sion a secret . Apparently , memory for the incident was lost - - perhaps due to a process like repression or dissociation , perhaps merely to childhood am - nesia or ordinary forgetting - - but the phobia remained solidly entrenched . In this case , the symptom appears to be an implicit memory for an incident lost to explicit memory . The evidence for emotion as implicit memory is not limited to anecdote ( To - bias , Kihlstrom , & Schacter , 1990 ) . There are several formal studies that al - so demonstrate that emotional responses can persist in the absence of cor - responding awareness of the past circumstances in which they were ac - quired . A study by Johnson , Kim , and Risse ( 1985 ) made use of the " mere exposure " effect on preferences ( Zajonc , 1968 ) : repeated exposure to an object tends to increase judgments of likability , even if there is no substan - tive information presented that would support such attitudinal change . John - son et al . exposed Korsakoff syndrome patients ( who are amnesic as a result of damage to diencephalic structures ) and controls to unfamiliar Korean me - lodies . Some melodies were played only once during the study phase , while others were played five or ten times . Later , the subjects were played these melodies , and other Korean melodies that were entirely new , and asked to indicate which they preferred . As expected from the mere exposure effect , both Korsakoff patients and controls preferred old over new melodies , al - though there was no effect of the number of exposures given to the old tunes . However , the patients showed greatly impaired levels of recognition , compared to the controls . Thus , exposure affected the amnesic patients ' pre - ference judgments , and index of emotional response to the melodies , even though the patients showed impaired memory for the exposure trials .

( 1985 ) provided subjects with more subs - tantive contact with the stimulus materials . The same amnesic and control patients who served in the melodies study were presented with pictures of two male faces , accompanied by fictional biographical information presented that depicted one individual positively ( the " good guy " ) and the other nega - tively ( the " bad guy " ) . When asked whom they preferred , control subjects always chose the face that had been paired with the positive information ; and they were always able to state that their judgment was made on the ba - sis of the accompanying descriptive information . The amnesic patients also showed a strong ( though not unanimous ) preference for the " good guy " ; however , they were able to recall only a negligible amount of the biographi - cal material presented at the time of study . Again , some aspect of emotional response - - liking of persons instead of melodies - - was altered by informa - tion presented during the study phase , in the absence of conscious recollec - tion of this information . Unfortunately , another group of investigators failed to obtain the mere expo - sure effect in a mixed group of amnesic patients who were repeatedly ex - posed to photographs of faces ( Redington , Volpe , & Gazzaniga , 1984 ) , sug - gesting that the exposure effect on preferences is not always dissociable from explicit memory . However , Johnson and Multhaup ( 1992 ) essentially confirmed the findings of Johnson et al . ( 1985 ) with a new sample of amnes - ic patients . In the melodies experiment , amnesic patients preferred old me - lodies new ones but controls did not ; controls remembered the melodies well , but amnesics did not . In the impression formation experiment , both amnesics and controls preferred the " good guy " to the " bad " one , even though the amnesics recalled very little of the biographical information pre - sented at the time of study . The dissociation between acquired emotional preferences and explicit memo - ry was confirmed by an experimental case study with patient Boswell , who had been was rendered densely amnesic following a case of herpes encepha - litis ( Damasio , Tranel & Damasio , 1989 ) . Despite a profound inability to rec - ognize people , it had been noted that Boswell would go to a particularly ge - nerous staff member if he wanted something . In the experiment , Boswell had an extended series of positive , negative and neutral encounters , respec - tively , with three different confederates . Upon subsequent questioning , Bos - well was unable to recall anything about any of the people and never indi - cated that they were familiar in any way . Nonetheless , when asked on a Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 14 | P a g e forced - choice test whom he liked best , and would approach for rewards and favors , he strongly preferred the " good " confederate over the " bad " one , with the neutral confederate falling in between . In addition to the disorders of memory produced by lesions to specific brain structures , there are also functional disorders of memory observed in the dissociative syndromes of psychogenic amnesia , psychogenic fugue , and multiple personality disorder . One of the interesting features of the function - al amnesias is that patients often display implicit memory for events lost to conscious recollection : sometimes this implicit memory takes the form of an emotional response . For example , in a case reported by Kaszniak and his colleagues , a victim of attempted homosexual rape was amnesic for the inci - dent , but experienced severe distress when shown a TAT card picturing a person attacking another from behind ( Kaszniak , Nussbaum , Berren , & San - tiago , 1988 ) . Similarly , Christianson and Nilsson ( 1989 ) observed that a woman who had suffered severe amnesia following assault and rape became extremely upset when returned to the scene of the crime , even though she had no explicit memory for the event . Finally , in Prince ' s ( 1910 ) case of Miss Beauchamp , a multiple personality , one alter ego , " B IV " , experienced strong emotional reactions to people and places that had emotional meaning to personality " B I " and vice versa ; however , neither personality had explicit memory for the emotionally arousing objects of the other and each would be puzzled by their inexplicably intense reactions to such stimuli . Similar dissoc - iations of affect from awareness have been reported in " split brain " patients ( Gazzaniga , 1985 ; LeDoux , Wilson , & Gazzaniga ; Sperry , Gazzaniga , & Bo - gen , 1969 ) . Amnesia for the source of a consciously experienced emotion is also a famili - ar phenomenon in hypnosis . While hypnotic suggestions are typically in - tended to alter some aspect of cognitive functioning , they can also have emotional and motivational effects . When these suggestions are accompa - nied by further suggestions for amnesia , the subject can experience a pro - found change in mood state , without knowing why this occurs . For example , Luria ( 1932 ) suggested to hypnotized subjects that they had committed a terrible crime , and then covered this paramnesia with a further suggestion for posthypnotic amnesia . On a later word - association test , the subjects showed evidence of anxiety in response to cues related to the suggested crime , even though they were amnesic for the suggestion . Luria ' s findings were essentially replicated by Huston , Shakow , and Erickson ( 1934 ) . Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 15 | P a g e In a related line of hypnosis research , Levitt ( 1967 ; Levitt & Chapman , 1979 ) administered direct suggestions for anxiety to hypnotic subjects , fol - lowed by a suggestion for posthypnotic amnesia . Even though the subjects could not consciously remember the suggestion , they displayed elevated le - vels of anxiety on various test measures . Similar findings were obtained by Blum ( 1979 ) and his colleagues . In their studies , subjects receive sugges - tions to relive a conflictual , ego - threatening experience from early childhood , and then a suggestion for posthypnotic amnesia covering the experience . The result , according to Blum , was to leave the subject in a state of anxiety which is free - floating , not tied to any hypnotic or childhood experience . Most recently , Bower and his colleagues ( Bower , 1981 ; Bower , Gilligan , & Monteiro , 1981 ; Bower , Monteiro , & Gilligan , 1978 ) used a variant on Luria ' s technique to study mood - dependent memory . In these experiments , hypno - tized subjects were given hypnotic suggestions to relive a particularly happy or sad experience from their past , and further given posthypnotic sugges - tions to experience those happy and sad emotional states , stripped of cogni - tive content about the instigating event , in response to particular cues . The suggestion was further covered by one for posthypnotic amnesia . Thus , dur - ing the experiment proper the subjects felt happy or sad without being aware that this was something that had been suggested to them previously , or which was more distantly related to some previous experience in their lives . The studies just described converge on the conclusion that emotional re - sponse can serve as an index of implicit memory . That is , subjects can dis - play emotional responses that are attributable to some event in their past history , in the absence of conscious recollection of that event . However , it must be admitted that the evidence in this regard is rather sparse , especially when compared to the vast body of literature on the perceptual and cogni - tive expressions of implicit memory ( e . g . , Roediger & McDermott , 1990 ; Shacter , 1987 ) . More systematic studies are needed , employing both am - nesic patients and normal subjects , specifically testing the hypothesis that emotional response , as an expression of implicit memory , can be dissociated from conscious recollection . Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 16 | P a g e Emotion as an Expression of Implicit Perception There is considerably better evidence for emotion as an index of implicit per - ception - - that is to say , where emotional responses are attributable to some event in the current environment , in the absence of conscious perception of that event . Here again , we begin with anecdote , and proceed to some formal studies . Levinson ( 1965 ) reported on a woman who came out of surgery inexplicably weepy , depressed , and disconsolate . The reasons for this remained obscure until Levinson , on a hunch , hypnotized the patient and regressed her to the time of the surgery - - at which time she blurted out , " the surgeon says it might be malignant ! " . Further investigation revealed that the doctors had discovered a possible malignancy during the surgery and had discussed it while she was anesthetized ( subsequent investigation proved it to be be - nign ) . Now adequate anesthesia , by definition , abolishes conscious aware - ness and thus explicit memory for surgical events . But , as discussed earlier , there is some evidence for the preservation of priming effects . Apparently , implicit perception during anesthesia can appear not just in the form of repe - tition priming effects , but also in terms of full - blown emotional states . More recently , Traub - Werner ( 1989 ) reported on an unusual case of simul - taneous panic attacks in two agoraphobic patients . The first patient ' s symp - toms had been well controlled by clonazepam and amitryptyline ; but one day , while she was washing her face , she unexpectedly experienced anxiety , fear of falling , palpitations , and depersonalization . She hid under the bed for some minutes , until she felt better . Later that day , she received a phone call from a friend , also agoraphobic , who reported her worst panic attack in years - - at precisely the same time of day . Further investigation revealed that an earthquake , registering magnitude 6 on the Richter scale , had oc - curred not far away at exactly the time of the two patients ' panic episodes . The interpretation is that an associated earth tremor , too weak to be con - sciously felt but perhaps picked up by the vestibular system , may have evoked anxiety in the first patient . More mundane perhaps , but certainly more tightly controlled , evidence of emotion as an index of implicit perception has emerged in a line of research on " subliminal mere exposure effects " . Recall Zajonc ' s ( 1968 ) discovery that mere exposure is sufficient to increase judgments of likability , an arguably Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 17 | P a g e affective response ; and the evidence from Johnson et al . ( 1985 ) and Dama - sio et al . ( 1989 ) that the exposure does not have to be consciously remem - bered in order to have an emotional effect ( see also Moreland & Zajonc , 1977 , 1979 ; but see Birnbaum & Mellers , 1979a , 1979b ) . Interestingly , it appears that the exposure does not have to be consciously perceived , either . For example , Wilson ( 1979 ) found that subjects preferred tones that had been presented in the unattended channel during a dichotic listening proce - dure to tones that had not been previously presented . Similarly , Kunst - Wilson & Zajonc ( 1980 ) presented a set of irregular polygons on a tachistos - cope , with exposures so brief that the stimuli were not consciously per - ceived : nevertheless , rated preference was affected by prior exposure histo - ry ( for an alternative interpretation , see Mandler , Nakamura , & Van Zandt , 1987 ) . This " subliminal " mere exposure effect has been replicated and extended by a number of investigators ( e . g . , Bonnano & Stillings , 1986 ; Murphy & Za - jonc , 1993 ; Seamon , Brody , & Kauff , 1983a , 1983b ; for reviews , see Bornstein , 1989 , 1992 ) . In perhaps the most dramatic extension of the Kunst - Wilson and Zajonc ( 1980 ) study , Bornstein and his colleagues found that subliminal exposures can affect not only subjects ' preferences for people ' s faces , but also their interpersonal behavior towards those very same people when they actually meet them later ( Bornstein , Leone , & Gal - ley , 1987 ) . Subjects who were subliminally exposed to a picture of a confe - derate during the study phase were more likely to express agreement with that confederate on a judgment task . However , testing of a separate group of subjects indicated that recognition of the " old " confederate was at chance levels , indicating that the faces had not been consciously perceived during the study phase . In fact , a meta - analysis by Bornstein ( 1989 ) found that the magnitude of the mere exposure effect was significantly greater with subli - minal than with supraliminal stimuli . Apparently , affective judgments are in - fluenced by perceptual fluency , which in turn is enhanced by the priming ef - fects of the subject ' s initial exposure to the material . When subjects con - sciously remember the prior exposure , they appear to correct their prefe - rence ratings accordingly ; but when the initial exposure is subliminal , so that subjects do not consciously perceive ( much less consciously remember ) it , subjects are unable to engage in discounting , resulting in a stronger effect on preference judgments ( Bornstein , 1992 ; Bornstein & D ' Agostino , 1992 , 1994 ; see also Klinger & Greenwald , 1994 ) . Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 18 | P a g e Other investigators have found similar sorts of effects , where subliminal or unattended stimuli have effects on judgments and behavior that would be clearly labeled as " emotional " . For example , Murphy and Zajonc ( 1993 ) found , like Bornstein ( 1989 ) , that subliminal exposure to emotional faces produced increased liking and preference for Chinese ideographs . In their view , the familiarity produced by subliminal exposure created diffuse positive feelings analogous to ( though different in valence from ) the clinical concept of free - floating anxiety . Of course , considerable early evidence for emotion as implicit perception was provided by investigations of perceptual defense , subception , and other as - pects of the " New Look " ( Bruner & Klein , 1960 ; see also Erdelyi , 1974 ; Greenwald , 1992 ; Kihlstrom et al . , 1992a , 1992b ) . More recently , Bargh and Pietromonaco ( 1982 ) found that subjects who had been exposed to hostile words followed by a masking stimulus attributed significantly more negative qualities to a pictured person than subjects who had not received this masked exposure ( see also Bargh , Bond , Lombardi , & Tota , 1986 ) . Similarly , Devine ( 1989 ) found that unmasked parafoveal presentation of words re - lated to negative stereotypes of African - Americans led to more negative evaluations of a target person whose race was unspecified . Niedenthal ( 1990 , 1992 ; Niedenthal , Setterlund , & Jones , 1994 ) and her col - leagues have produced yet another emotional adaptation of the basic subli - minal priming paradigm . In the study phase of each experiment , briefly pre - sented primes consisting of faces expressing emotions of joy or disgust were rendered subliminal by means of a metacontrasting presentation of clearly supraliminal cartoon figures . In the test phase , the subjects were asked to discriminate between old , previously presented cartoons and new distrac - tors . These were also preceded by a face prime , which again was rendered subliminal by metacontrast . On half the test trials , the affect associated with the prime was the same as it had been on the study trials ; for the remaind - er , the prime was drawn from the opposite emotional category . Congruence between the primes generally facilitated recognition of the targets , especially when the prime was negative . A second study , in which emotionally charged faces or scenes primed emotionally neutral women ' s faces , obtained essen - tially the same effect . Moreover , the affective valence of the prime influ - enced the subjects ' interpretations of the target ' s emotional state . Based on research indicating that the perception of emotionally expressive faces in - duces a similar emotional state in the perceiver ( Niedenthal & Showers , Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 19 | P a g e 1991 ) , Niedenthal has proposed that a subliminal emotional prime elicits a corresponding emotional state in the perceiver ; this state then serves as a cue for both perceptual identification and recognition memory . It is also , therefore , an expression of implicit perception . Additional evidence that subliminal emotional primes actually elicit conscious feeling states comes from research on subliminal fear conditioning by Oh - man and his colleagues ( for reviews , see Ohman , 1998 ) . In one line of re - search ( Ohman , Dimberg , & Esteves , 1989 ) , subjects were conditioned to associate an electric shock with presentation of an angry face ( an unrein - forced happy face served as a control stimulus ) . In subsequent unreinforced test trials , the angry face was masked by a neutral face . Despite the fact that subjects could not consciously perceive the angry face , they gave condi - tioned electrodermal responses when it was presented , compared to masked presentation of the happy face . A subsequent pilot study showed that acqui - sition of a conditioned fear response is possible , even when the conditioned stimulus is masked and therefore not consciously perceptible . In another line of research , Ohman & Soares ( 1993 , 1994 ) substituted nonmasked pictures of snakes , spiders , flowers , and mushrooms as conditioned stimuli . On un - reinforced test trials , masked pictures of snakes and spiders elicited condi - tioned electrodermal fear responses , but masked pictures of flowers and mushrooms did not . The fact that only the snake and spider pictures sur - vived masking was interpreted within the framework of Seligman ' s ( 1971 ) preparedness theory of phobias which argues that , by virtue of our evolutio - nary history , some stimuli ( such as snakes and spiders ) automatically give rise to rapid and long - lasting conditioned fear responses . In this case , the assumption of automaticity of the association is supported by the fact that the fear response persists even when the fear stimulus is subliminal , and thus unattended . To date , the most systematic exploration of preconscious emotional processing has been conducted by Greenwald and his colleagues ( Green - wald , Draine , & Abrams , 1996 ; Greenwald , Klinger & Liu , 1989 ; Greenwald , Klinger , & Schuh , 1995 ) explored another emotional response : evaluative judgments of words . These studies are especially notable for the amount of care taken to address methodological criticisms of earlier studies purporting to demonstrate subliminal perception ( e . g . , Eriksen , 1960 ; Holender , 1986 ) . In all the experiments of the series , subjects are asked to judge an aspect of the connotative meaning of a word : whether it is affectively positive or Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 20 | P a g e negative . In their earliest experiments , presentation of the target word was preceded by a prime word which was either affectively positive or negative . The prime was so effectively masked that subjects were unable to determine whether it appeared on the left or the right side of a fixation point . Never - theless , evaluative judgments of the target were facilitated by the presenta - tion of primes drawn from the same affective category . More recently , Greenwald et al . ( 1996 ) added a further refinement , in which subjects were constrained to make their judgments of the target within a very brief period of time following its presentation - - further insuring that the influence of the prime on the target judgment was not the product of conscious reflection . On the basis of early studies showing a dissociation between preference judgments and conscious recollection ( Moreland & Zajonc , 1977 ) and con - scious perception ( Kunst - Wilson and Zajonc , 1980 ) , Zajonc ( 1980 , 1984a , 1984b ) argued that emotional processing is independent of , and temporally prior to , cognitive processing ( see also Lazarus , 1982 , 1984 ) . However , later studies documenting similar dissociations between explicit and implicit ex - pressions of memory ( e . g . , Schacter , 1987 ) and perception ( e . g . , Kihlstrom et al . , 1992a ) put a different light on the early results . One might just as well conclude , with respect to memory , that dissociations between recall and priming show that memory itself is independent of , and temporally prior to , cognitive processing . It is now clear that , in the early studies and those that followed , some aspect of emotional response is serving as an implicit ex - pression of perception and / or memory . But unconscious cognition is still cognition . Furthermore , if there were an emotional system separate from cognition , it would still need the cognitive capacity to analyze stimuli , link them to prior knowledge , and generate emotional feelings and expressions ( Leventhal , 1980 , 1984 ) . The fact that such cognitive processes can go on outside of awareness , so that changes in evaluative judgment and other as - pects of emotional response can be dissociated from explicit perception and memory , yields one aspect of the emotional unconscious . People can be aware of their emotional states , but unaware of the percepts and memories which evoke these states . " Feeling Memories " : A Cautionary Note Clinical folklore about post - traumatic stress disorder has revived the notion , originated by Brewer and Freud ( 1893 - 1895 / 1955 ) that unconscious memo - ries of trauma express themselves implicitly as intrusive feelings ( see , e . g . , Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 21 | P a g e Bass & Davis , 1988 ; Blume , 1990 ; Frederickson , 1993 ; Herman , 1992 ; Terr , 1994 ; van der Kolk , McFarlane , & Weisaeth , 1996 ; for a detailed analysis of the parallels between Freud ' s theories and later clinical practices , see Bow - ers & Farvolden , 1996 ; Crews , 1995 ; Kihlstrom , 1996b , 1997b , 1998c ) . For example Frederickson ( 1992 ) has distinguished between a conscious recall memory and an unconscious feeling memory : Feeling memory is the memory of an emotional response to a particular sit - uation . If the situation we are being triggered to remember is a repressed memory , we will have the feelings pertaining to the event without any con - scious recall of the event itself . Feeling memory is often experienced as a flood of inexplicable emotion , particularly around abuse issues . . . . A felt sense that something abusive has happened is a common form of a feeling memory . Some survivors will say , " Yes , I think I was sexually abused , but it ' s just a gut feeling . " These clients are experiencing a feeling memory about being abused , even though at that moment they can recall nothing about their abuse ( p . 92 ) . In some respects , the notion of a " feeling memory " finds support in the lite - rature reviewed in this section , which indicates that emotional responses can , indeed , serve as expressions of implicit memory . However , there is an important difference : the experimental literature we have reviewed provides independent corroboration of the emotion - eliciting event . Implicit memory may be inferred only when such evidence is available , and such information is rarely available in clinical practice . Nevertheless , clinical practitioners may infer a history of prior trauma and abuse from the patient ' s current emotion - al symptoms , and then engage in therapeutic practices intended to recover the traumatic memories and restore them to conscious accessibility . Of course , in the absence of objective corroboration of the patient ' s history , such inferences are tautological , and should be avoided - - not least because the techniques used to recover ostensibly lost memories are highly sugges - tive , and may lead patients to reconstruct distorted or false memories of trauma and abuse ( Kihlstrom , 1996b , 1998c ; Lindsay & Read , 1994 , 1995 ; Shobe & Kihlstrom , 1998 ) . Implicit Emotion But can people be unaware of their emotional states themselves ? The propo - sition seems to contain an internal contradiction , because emotions must be Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 22 | P a g e felt , and feeling is by any ordinary definition a conscious experience ( Clore , 1994 ) . But environmental stimuli must be felt , too ; yet cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience is gradually coming to terms with the possibility that percepts can be unconscious ( Kihlstrom et al . , 1992a ; Greenwald et al . , 1996 ) , just as it earlier came to terms with the possibility that memories can be unconscious ( Roediger & McDermott , 1990 ; Schacter , 1987 ) . If there is a cognitive unconscious , in which percepts , memories , and thoughts influence experience , thought , and action outside of phenomenal awareness , then why can ' t there be an emotional unconscious as well ? The answer depends on how we define emotion . If we define emotion as a conscious feeling state , a positive answer is foreclosed , by definition . But if we define emotion diffe - rently , the question is at least open to empirical evidence . Desynchrony In his classic research on experimental neurosis in dogs , Gantt ( 1937 , 1953 ) observed that separate components of a conditioned fear response could be acquired and extinguished at different rates , and persist for different lengths of time , resulting in an organismic state of schizokinesis reflecting the " dis - harmony or cleavage in behavioral , somatic , and psychophysiological re - sponse systems " ( Mineka , 1979 , p . 987 ) . The clear implication of Gantt ' s work is that a multifaceted emotional response , and that these facets can be separated , or dissociated , from each other . Gantt ' s ( 1937 , 1953 ) observations have been confirmed in more recent re - search on fear conditioning . For example , Mineka ( 1979 ) distinguished four quite different response systems which have been used in the study of fear conditioning in nonhuman animals : conditioned emotional responses , in - creased rate of conditioned avoidance response , passive avoidance , and conditioned heart rate . Further , she showed that these indices of fear could be dissociated from learned avoidance behavior . Animals can behave as if they are afraid , even if they do not appear to manifest fear according to some standard laboratory measures ( see also Mineka , 1985 , 1992 ) . One in - terpretation of such findings is that , contrary to Mowrer ' s ( 1947 ) two - process theory , avoidance learning is not motivated by fear . Another is that the subjective experience of fear is only one component of a broader emo - tional response to fear stimuli . Similar observations have been made in the case of human fears and phobias . For example , in a study of systematic de - sensitization of snake phobia , Lang and Lazovik ( 1963 ) found that some Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 23 | P a g e subjects would show substantial changes in avoidance behavior , while still expressing fear of the snake ; other subjects would deny fear of the snake , but show elevated cardiovascular activity and persisting avoidance behavior . Based on observations such as these , Lang ( 1968 , 1971 , 1978 , 1988 ; Lang , Rice , & Sternbach , 1972 ) proposed a multiple - system theory of emotion . Ac - cording to this theory , every emotional response consists of several compo - nents : verbal - cognitive , corresponding to subjective feeling state ( e . g . , of fear ) ; overt motor , or behavioral , response ( e . g . , escape or avoidance ) ; and a covert physiological response mediated by the autonomic and skeletal nervous systems ( e . g . , skin conductance or heart rate ) . Lang further pro - posed that these three systems are partially independent , although they also interact with each other in important ways . When all three systems act to - gether , the person experiences intense emotional arousal . Under circums - tances of attenuated emotion , however , the correlations among these sys - tems tend to break apart , at the same time as their individual levels of activ - ity are reduced . Moreover , Lang proposed that the different components of emotion can have different developmental histories . For example , autonomic responses to emotional stimuli may appear early in development , with the behavioral and cognitive responses emerging only later . Or , alternatively , the cognitive component of an emotional state can be acquired first , as for example through the social learning of fear , with the behavioral and physiological components coming on line later , if at all . Lang further proposed that effec - tive psychotherapy for anxiety states and other emotional disorders should be directed at all three components : it cannot be assumed for example , that flooding directed at reduce compulsive behavior will necessarily reduce sub - jective anxiety and physiological arousal as well . Rachman and Hodgson ( 1974 ; Hodgson & Rachman , 1974 ; Rachman , 1978 , 1981 , 1990 ) picked up Lang ' s theme and explored the implications of desyn - chrony among emotional systems , and especially between overt behavior and covert physiology , for the treatment of anxiety disorders . They proposed that different forms of treatment would have different effects on the various components of fear and anxiety : for example , flooding might reduce avoid - ance behavior but leave autonomic arousal largely intact ; on the other hand , spontaneous remission would affect autonomic arousal first , but behavioral avoidance would persist for a longer period of time . Like Lang ( 1968 ) , Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 24 | P a g e Rachman and Hodgson proposed that fear and anxiety should be assessed in terms of all three components , and that treatment should be directed toward that component which was most " abnormal " ( see also Norton , DiNardo , Bar - low , 1983 ) . One way or another , however , the remaining components would eventually catch up . So long as one component persisted unchanged , in their view , the likelihood of relapse remained high . The general idea of desynchrony is that an emotional response can be ma - nifest at one level , but not at another ( Hugdahl , 1981 ; Turpin , 1991 ) . Given that they were writing from a tradition of behavior therapy which emphasiz - es objective measurement , it is perhaps natural , and certainly understanda - ble , that both Lang ( 1968 ) and Rachman ( 1978 ) placed most emphasis on desynchrony between the behavioral and physiological components of emo - tion . In the present context , however , we are most interested in cases that represent the emotional analog of the explicit - implicit distinction in memory : where the subjective component of an emotion ( conscious feeling state ) is absent , while the behavioral and physiological components persist outside of phenomenal awareness . The snake phobic denies fear , but somehow never quite manages to go near the reptile house at the zoo ; the agoraphobic claims to be cured , and even ventures outside the house , but blood pressure and heart rate still go way up . If such observations reflected merely denial , or a flight into health , they would not be too interesting . But suppose that the patients ' reports accurately reflect the subjective state of affairs - - that they really do not experience the emotions that used to bother them . If the behavioral and autonomic signs of emotion persist unabated , why can ' t we say that they are displaying unconscious emotion - - or at least an uncons - cious emotional response ? Apparently , dissociations between subjective feelings and covert psychophy - siological response are found quite commonly in the anxiety disorders ( e . g . , Barlow , Mavissakalian , & Schofield , 1980 ; Craske , Sanderson , & Barlow , 1987 ; Vermilyea , Boice , & Barlow , 1984 ; for reviews , see Barlow , 1988 ; Rachman , 1990 ) . Indeed , such findings were a primary motive for Lang ' s proposal of the multiple - systems theory of emotion in the first place ( Lang & Lazovik , 1963 ) . Cardiology clinics frequently encounter patients who com - plain of behavioral and physiological symptoms associated with panic disord - er but who report no subjective fear or distress , aside from concern about the presenting complaints themselves ( Kushner & Beitman , 1990 ; Beitman , Mukerji , Russell , & Grafing , 1993 ) . Similar patients have been seen in neu - Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 25 | P a g e rology clinics ( Russell , Kushner , Beitman , & Bartels , 1991 ) . A survey of stu - dents with a history of panic attacks found that those who reported " fear - less " panic attacks were less likely to engage in avoidance behavior , or to use alcohol or drugs as coping strategies . Some evidence for desynchrony between subjective experience and covert psychophysiology is also provided in the literature on child - parent attach - ment . Dozier and Kobak ( 1992 ) administered an attachment interview in which subjects were asked to express their feelings about a number of dif - ferent imagined scenarios involving separation from their parents . Subjects scoring high on a dimension of deactivation / hyperactivation , who strategical - ly divert attention from thoughts , memories , and feelings related to attach - ment , showed greater skin conductance responses to scenarios involving pa - rental separation , rejection , threats of separation , and changes in relation - ship with the parents . Unfortunately , dissociations between subjective feelings and overt behavioral response appear to be much less common ( e . g . , Lang , Lazovik , & Reynolds , 1965 ) . Moreover , evaluations of treatment outcome typically indicate that cognitive subjective fear persists even as behavioral and psychophysiological indices of fear diminish - - precisely the opposite of the pattern of desynchro - ny implied by the concept of implicit emotion ( e . g . , Lang & Lazovik , 1963 ; Gerew , Romney , & LeBoef , 1989 ; Thomas & Rapp , 1977 ) . The emotional deficits ( e . g . , " blunted " or " inappropriate " affect ) commonly associated with schizophrenia also have a flavor of desynchrony ( Dworkin , 1992 ) . Thus , anhedonia refers to a deficit in the conscious experience of emotion , which may leave behavioral or physiological expressions of emotion unimpaired . Similarly , flat affect refers to a deficit in the behavioral expres - sion or display of emotion , which may not extend to subjective experience or covert physiology . In fact , Kring and Neale ( 1993 , 1996 ) found that schi - zophrenic patients expressed significantly less emotion than normal controls in response to emotional film clips ; however , self - reports of emotional expe - rience did not differ between the groups , and the schizophrenics actually showed greater skin conductance reactivity . Again , this is desynchrony , but it is not the desynchrony implied by the concept of implicit emotion .

Although conceived by Freud as a general psychological process available to everyone , a tendency to use repression as a defense may be reconstrued as an individual difference variable , as it was by Rosenzweig in his work on the Zeigarnik effect in memory , and his exploration of the personality correlates of hypnotizability ( Rosenzweig , 1938 ; Rosenzweig & Mason , 1934 ; Rosenz - weig & Sarason , 1942 ; Sarason & Rosenzweig , 1942 ) . Unfortunately , early attempts to measure individual differences in repressive tendency by means of questionnaires , as exemplified by Byrne ' s ( 1961 , 1964 ) Repression - Sensitization Scale ( RSS ; Bell & Byrne , 1978 ) , foundered on the shoals of discriminant validity : somewhat paradoxically , perhaps , repression as meas - ured by the RSS proved to be highly correlated with anxiety and distress . However , other measurement approaches may prove more useful to under - standing the differences between explicit and implicit emotion . Repressive Coping Style . More recently , Weinberger and his associates have attempted to construct a measurement of repressive coping style which is free of such confounds ( Weinberger , 1990 ; Weinberger , Schwartz , & Da - vidson , 1979 ) . In Weinberger ' s original procedure ( Weinberger et al . , 1979 ) , subjects who show extremely low levels of trait anxiety , as shown on Tay - lor ' s Manifest Anxiety Scale ( MAS ; Taylor , 1953 ) , but extremely high levels of defensiveness , as shown by the Marlowe - Crowne Social Desirability Scale ( SDS ; Crowne & Marlowe , 1960 ) , are labeled as " repressors " . Although re - pressors do report low levels of anxiety , Weinberger et al . ( 1979 ) found that they showed elevated levels of physiological response - - EMG , heart rate , and galvanic skin resistance - - to sexual and aggressive phrase stems . In fact , their levels of physiological reactivity were comparable to those shown by high - anxious , nondefensive subjects . The general thrust of these results was later confirmed by Asendorf & Scherer ( 1983 ) . Given results such as these , we might want to speculate that repressors have a talent for desyn - chrony : they may not display high levels of stress to others , or even expe - rience it themselves ; but at the same time , their physiology is churning away anxiously . This situation may be construed as a dissociation between Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 27 | P a g e explicit ( subjective ) and implicit ( behavioral or physiological ) components of emotion . Unfortunately , however , there has been no followup of this early evidence of implicit emotion . Instead , research has focused on the development of new methods for assessing repression , and on repression as a risk factor for medical complaints . Thus , Weinberger ( 1990 , 1997 ; Weinberger & Schwartz , 1990 ) reformulated the concept of repressive tendency , and introduced a new instrument , the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory ( WAI ) , for measuring individual differences in repressive coping style . The WAI follows the same logic as the earlier procedure , but whereas the original formulation involved a fourfold typology ( produced by splitting the two dimensions of anxiety and social desirability ) , the new measure yields six categories . Subjects who are low in distress ( anxiety , depression , low self - esteem , and low well - being ) and at least moderately high in restraint ( impulse control , suppression of aggression , consideration of others , and responsibility ) are candidates for identification as repressors . However , a measure of defensiveness ( denial of distress , repressive defensiveness ) is added to the mix in order to distin - guish between genuine repressors and the merely self - assured . As a means of identifying repressors , the WAI is more conservative than the older proce - dure employing the MAS and SDS ( Mulvaney , Kihlstrom , Figueredo , & Schwartz , 1992 ) . Still , to date no research has attempted to replicate the observations of Weinberger et al . ( 1979 ) with the new measure , nor - - ex - cept for the replication of Asendorf and Scherer ( 1983 ) , has any published research examined repressive style with respect to implicit emotion . Alexithymia and Anhedonia . Another potentially relevant personality con - struct is alexithymia ( Nemiah , Freyberger , & Sifneos , 1981 ; Nemiah & Sif - neos , 1970 ; see also Apfel & Sifneos , 1979 ; Taylor , 1984 ; Taylor & Bagby , 1988 ; Taylor , Bagby , & Parker , 1997 ; Taylor & Taylor , 1997 ) , in which people have difficulty describing their emotional states , or even in discrimi - nating one state from another . Alexithymia , or restricted emotionality , seems at least superficially similar to the repressive coping style ( Weinberg - er , 1990 ) . Again , it may be that alexithymic individuals have " no words for feelings " - - a fairly direct translation from the Greek roots - - because they are not aware of their feelings in the first place ( Lane , Ahern , Schwartz , & Kaszniak , 1997 ) . Alexithymia is a prominent feature among neurological pa - tients with hemispheric commissurotomy ( e . g . , Hoppe & Bogen , 1977 ; Ten - Houten , Hoppe , Bogen , & Walter , 1985 , 1986 ; TenHouten , Walter , Hoppe , & Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 28 | P a g e Bogen , 1988 ) , suggesting that the division in awareness affecting such pa - tients includes an inability to communicate , via the language centers of the left hemisphere , emotion arising from centers in the right hemisphere . In other words , the left hemisphere might not be aware of , and thus unable to communicate , emotions of which the right hemisphere is perfectly aware - - awareness which might be revealed if the right hemisphere possessed the same language skills as the left . In any event , the alexithymic patient ' s ina - bility to discriminate between such feelings as anger and sadness suggests a rather marked deficit in explicit emotion . The question , then , is whether we can find evidence for implicit emotion in these people , in terms of behavioral or physiological indices . Clinical lore , as well as an increasing body of empiri - cal data , indicates that alexithymics are at risk for psychophysiological and somatoform disorders . Perhaps alexithymics , like repressors , have a talent for desynchrony , with emotion expressed physiologically even if it is not ex - perienced subjectively . Alexithymia should be distinguished from anhedonia , an inability to expe - rience positive emotions ( Chapman , Chapman , & Raulin , 1976 ) . However , the alexithymic inability to communicate emotions to others is correlated with social anhedonia , or a preference for solitary as opposed to social ac - tivities ( Prince & Berenbaum , 1993 ) . In the present context . however , we may offer the hypothesis that physical anhedonia affects explicit ( subjective ) components of positive emotion , leaving implicit ( behavioral and physiologi - cal ) components of positive emotion intact . Levels of Emotional Awareness . Lane and his colleagues ( Lane , Quinlan , Schwartz , Walker , & Zeitlin , 1990 ; Lane & Schwartz , 1987 , 1992 ) have drawn on the developmental theories of Piaget and Werner ( for a review , see Flavell , 1963 ) to propose five levels of emotional awareness determined by the manner in which the individual ' s emotional states are organized . Ac - cording to their theory , emotional experience is progressively differentiated and integrated as the individual develops cognitively . At the lowest level , roughly corresponding to the earliest sensorimotor stage of Piagetian theory , the person is aware only of bodily sensations ; at the next level , correspond - ing to later sensorimotor stages , the person is also aware of action tenden - cies . In neither case , however , is there awareness of emotion as such . Awareness of emotion occurs at a level corresponding to the preoperational stage , where it is confined to awareness of single , pervasive emotions . At a level corresponding to the stage of concrete operations , the person is aware Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 29 | P a g e of emotion blends and simultaneous opposites . And at a level corresponding to formal operations , the person can be aware of subtle nuances of emotion , as well as a difference between one ' s own emotional reactions and those of others . It should be understood , however , that shifts in emotional awareness from one level to the next are not coterminous with the progress of cognitive de - velopment , which is why it makes sense to distinguish among levels of emo - tional awareness in adults . Some adults , while firmly ensconced in formal operations with respect to their cognitive abilities , may have only primitive , sensory - motor , emotional reactions - - in other words , no emotional aware - ness at all . Interestingly , some of Lane ' s levels of emotional awareness cor - respond nicely to the three components of emotional response postulated by multiple - systems theory : physiological ( bodily sensations ) , behavioral ( ac - tion tendencies ) , and subjective ( single emotions , blends , and nuances ) . Thus , one way of conceptualizing a desynchrony between explicit and impli - cit emotion is in terms of an impairment at higher levels of emotional awareness which leaves lower levels intact . Hypnotic Analgesia A further example of desynchrony between the subjective experience of emotion and the behavioral and physiological expressions of it is provided by hypnotic analgesia ( Hilgard & Hilgard , 1975 ) . Following appropriate sugges - tions , many highly hypnotizable subjects report feeling no pain when ex - posed to normally painful stimulation . Although analgesia may be construed as a special case of sensory anesthesia , in fact pain has two components : sensory pain , providing information about the location and severity of irrita - tion or injury , and suffering , a psychological reaction of unpleasantness which depends on the meaning of the sensory pain ( Hilgard , 1969 ; Melzack & Torgerson , 1971 ) . Suffering is an explicitly emotional component that is not always present in the other skin senses , such as touch and temperature . Sensory pain and suffering are dissociable in terms of subjects ' pain ratings ( Gracely & Nabiloff , 1996 ; Melzack , 1975 ; Melzack & Torgerson , 1971 ) , and they also appear to be mediated by different brain systems : sensory pain by the somatosensory cortex , suffering by the anterior cingulate cortex ( Rain - ville , Duncan , Price , Carrier , & Bushnell , 1997 ) . Ordinarily , hypnotic sugges - tions for analgesia diminish awareness of both sensory pain and suffering ( Hilgard , 1969 ; Knox , Morgan , & Hilgard , 1974 ) ; however , it is also possible Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 30 | P a g e to alter suffering while leaving sensory pain unaffected ( Rainville et al . , 1997 ) . Clinical studies conducted since the mid - 19th century indicate that hypnotic analgesia can be highly effective in relieving the pain of major surgery . However , the more common clinical use of analgesia is in the treatment of postoperative pain , episodic pain associated with specific medical and sur - gical procedures , burns , obstetrics , dentistry , and chronic pain associated with illness ( E . Hilgard & J . Hilgard , 1975 ; J . Hilgard & LeBaron , 1984 ) . These clinical results are confirmed by more tightly controlled laboratory studies . For example , Stern and his colleagues found that hypnosis was more effective than acupuncture , placebo acupuncture , morphine , aspirin , diazepam , and placebo in counteracting both cold - pressor and ischemic pain ( Stern , Brown , Ulett , & Sletten , 1977 ) . Other laboratory studies indicated that hypnotizable subjects respond differently to analgesia suggestions than do insusceptible subjects who are instructed to simulate hypnosis ( Hilgard , Macdonald , Morgan , & Johnson , 1978 ) . Hypnotic analgesia is not mediated by placebo effects ( McGlashan , Evans , & Orne , 1969 ) , or by the tranquilizing effects of relaxation ( Greene & Reyher , 1972 ) . Hypnotic analgesia is not re - versed by naloxone , an opiate antagonist , so it is not mediated by the re - lease of endogenous opiates ( Goldstein & Hilgard , 1975 ; Spiegel & Albert , 1983 ) . Most important , hypnotic analgesia does not appear to be mediated by the subject ' s engagement in stress inoculation procedures , such as self - distraction and reinterpretation , which alter the subject ' s response to , but not his / her awareness of , the pain stimulus . Miller and Bowers ( 1986 ) found that subjects administered hypnotic suggestions for analgesia did not report engaging in such strategies . Moreover , response to hypnotic analgesia sug - gestions was mediated by hypnotizability , while response to stress - inoculation instructions was not . A second paper by Miller and Bowers ( 1993 ) showed that stress inoculation strategies interfered with performance on a difficult vocabulary test , while hypnotic analgesia did not . Finally , Har - gadon , Bowers , and Woody ( 1995 ) showed that the use of counterpain im - agery , a common stress inoculation strategy , had no effect on hypnotic analgesia . Taken together , these studies show that while stress inoculation can reduce pain ( Meichenbaum , 1977 ; Spanos , 1986 ; Chaves , 1989 ) , it does not mediate pain reduction in hypnotic analgesia . Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 31 | P a g e Hilgard ( 1973 , 1977 ) has proposed that hypnotic analgesia is mediated by an amnesia - like dissociative barrier which partially or fully blocks the sub - ject ' s conscious perception and awareness of pain . Some evidence for this dissociative process comes from studies using the " hidden observer " tech - nique , in which it is suggested to the analgesic subject that there is a " hid - den part " of the person which may have registered , and can report , the true level of pain stimulation . In response to some subjects will report levels of pain which are comparable to those experienced in the absence of analgesia suggestions ( Hilgard , Morgan , & Macdonald , 1975 ; Hilgard , Hilgard , Macdo - nald , Morgan , & Johnson , 1978 ) . The hidden observer is a metaphor for the continuing cognitive representation of pain outside of conscious awareness , and the means by which it may be accessed . Although hidden observer in - structions may be interpreted as altering contextual demands to report pain ( Spanos , 1986 ) or expectations about pain ( Kirsch & Lynn , 1998 ) , hypnotic subjects are much less responsive to manipulations of the testing context than are subjects instructed to simulate hypnosis ( Kihlstrom , 1998b ; Lau - rence , Perry , & Kihlstrom , 1983 ) . Therefore it seems that the demand cha - racteristics ( Orne , 1962 , 1979 ) of the experimental situation are not suffi - cient to produce the hidden observer in analgesic subjects . While hypnotic analgesia alters the person ' s subjective awareness of pain and distress , it has little impact on physiological responses to pain stimula - tion ( Barber & Hann , 1962 ; Hilgard , Morgan , Lange , Lenox , Macdonald , Mar - shall , & Sachs , 1974 ; Sears , 1932 ; Shor , 1962 ; Stern et al . , 1977 ; Sutcliffe , 1961 ) . Interpretation of this finding is ambiguous , because psychophysiolog - ical parameters to not show the same lawful covariation with intensity of stimulation shown by self - reports of pain ( Hilgard , 1969 ) . The preservation of physiological responses to the pain stimulus does not impeach the sub - jects ' self - reports of analgesia , however , because the same dissociation is found with other analgesic agents , including aspirin , diazepam , and mor - phine ( Stern et al . , 1977 ) . However , the basic finding of a dissociation be - tween self - reports of analgesia and persisting physiological responses to the pain stimulus is consistent with the notion of desynchrony between the sub - jective and physiological components of pain as an emotional state . Obvious - ly , however , further research is needed to evaluate the hypothesis of desyn - chrony as applied to hypnotic analgesia ( or , for that matter , any other anal - gesic ) . Such research should compare self - reports with psychophysiological indices , but also with overt behavioral indices of pain , such as facial expres - sion . Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 32 | P a g e Implicit Attitudes Yet another line of evidence bearing on the concept of implicit emotion comes from recent social - psychological work on attitudes , stereotypes , and prejudice . In social psychology , attitudes have a central affective compo - nent : they are dispositions to favor or oppose certain objects , such as indi - viduals , groups of people , or social policies , and the dimensions of favorable - unfavorable , support - oppose , pro - anti naturally map onto affective dimen - sions of pleasure - pain or approach - avoidance . As Thurstone put it , " attitude is the affect for or against a psychological object " ( 1931 , p . 261 ) . Like emo - tions , attitudes are generally thought of as conscious mental dispositions : people are assumed to be aware that they are opposed to nuclear power plants , or favor a women ' s right to choose . Similarly , people are generally believed to be aware of the stereotyped beliefs that they hold about social outgroups , and of the prejudiced behavior that they display towards mem - bers of such groups . And for that reason , attitudes and stereotypes are gen - erally measured by asking subjects to reflect and report on their beliefs or behavior . However , Greenwald and Banaji ( 1995 ) proposed an extension of the explicit - implicit distinction into the domain of attitudes . Briefly , they suggest that people possess positive and negative implicit attitudes about themselves and other people , which affect ongoing social behavior outside of conscious awareness . Following the general form of the explicit - implicit distinction applied to memory , perception , learning , and thought in the cognitive domain , we may define an explicit attitude as the conscious awareness of one ' s favorable or unfavorable opinion concerning some object or issue . By contrast , an implicit attitude refers to any effect of such an opinion on a person ' s ongoing expe - rience , thought , and action , regardless of whether that opinion can be con - sciously reported . From a methodological point of view , explicit attitudes would be assessed by tasks requiring conscious reflection on one ' s opinions ; implicit attitudes would be assessed by tasks which do not require such ref - lection . A particularly provocative demonstration of implicit attitudes affecting beha - vior is provided by Greenwald and Schuh ( 1994 ) in an analysis of reference citation practices among social scientists ( Study 1 ) and prejudice research - ers ( Study 2 ) . In these studies , the authors ' names , and the names of the authors cited in their papers , were classified into three ethnic categories : Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 33 | P a g e Jewish , non - Jewish , or other . Authors were approximately 40 % more likely to cite colleagues from their own ethnic category , a significant difference that could not be attributed to either differential assortment by ethnicity to research topic , or the tendency for authors to cite their personal acquain - tances . Although it seems likely that few of the authors in question would consciously admit to ethnic prejudice ( social scientists in general , and preju - dice researchers in particular , tending to be a rather liberal bunch ) , their be - havior suggests the operation of negative attitudes toward members of a re - ligious outgroup . A more tightly controlled demonstration of implicit attitudes is provided by a study of the " false fame effect " by Banaji and Greenwald ( 1995 ) . In the typi - cal false fame procedure ( Jacoby , Kelley , Brown , & Jasechko , 1989 ) , sub - jects are asked to study a list consisting of the names of famous and non - famous people . Later , they are presented with another list of names , includ - ing the names studied earlier and an equal number of new names , and asked to identify the names of famous people . The general finding of their research is that subjects are more likely to identify new rather than old non - famous names as famous . In their adaptation , Banaji and Greenwald in - cluded both male and female names in their lists , and found that subjects were more likely to identify male names as famous . This result suggests that the average subject is more likely to associate achievement with males than with females - - a common gender stereotype . Similarly , Blair and Banaji ( 1996 ) conducted a series of experiments in which subjects were asked to classify first names as male or female . Prior to the presentation of each target , the subjects were primed with a word representing a gender - stereotypical or gender - neutral activity , object , or profession ) . In general , Blair and Banaji ( 1996 ) found a gender - specific priming effect : judgments were faster when the gender connotations of the prime were congruent with the gender category of the name . This means that gender stereotypes influenced their subjects ' classification behavior . In the area of racial stereotypes , Gaertner and McLaughlin ( 1983 ) employed a conventional lexical - decision task with positive and negative words related to stereotypes of Blacks and whites , and the words " black " or " white " serv - ing as the primes . There was a priming effect when positive targets were primed by " white " rather than " black " , but no priming was found for the negative targets , and this was so regardless of the subjects ' scores on a self - Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 34 | P a g e report measure of racial prejudice . thus , the effect of attitudes on lexical de - cision was independent of conscious prejudice . Similarly , Dovidio Evans , and Tyler ( 1986 ) employed a task in which sub - jects were presented with positive and negative trait labels , and asked whether the characteristic could ever be true of black or white individuals . While the judgments themselves did not differ according to race ( even the most rabid racist will admit that there are some lazy whites and smart blacks ) , subjects were faster to endorse positive traits for whites , and to en - dorse negative traits for blacks . Thus , even though conscious attitudes did not discriminate between racial groups , response latencies did . These studies , and others like them ( e . g . , Devine , 1989 ) , seem to reveal the implicit influence of sexist or racist attitudes on behavior . However , at present , interpretation of these results is somewhat unclear . In the first place , the logic of the research is that stereotype - specific priming indicates that subjects actually hold the stereotype in question - - that , for example , the subjects in Blair and Banaji ' s ( 1996 ) experiment really ( if unconsciously ) believe that males are athletic and arrogant while females are caring and dependent ) . However , it is also possible that these priming effects reflect the subjects ' abstract knowledge of stereotypical beliefs held by members of so - ciety at large , though they themselves personally reject them - - both con - sciously and unconsciously . Thus , a subject may know that people in general believe that ballet is for females and the gym is for males , without him - or herself sharing that belief . Even so , this knowledge may affect his or her performance on various experimental tasks , leading to the incorrect attribu - tion of the stereotypical beliefs to the subject . Moreover , most studies of implicit attitudes lack a comparative assessment of explicit attitudes . Although we might like to think that the average Gentile social psychologist is not antisemitic ( Greenwald & Schuh , 1994 ) , this may not be so . Implicit measures of attitudes may be useful additions to the me - thodological armamentarium of the social psychologist , but in the present context their interest value rests on demonstrations of dissociations between explicit and implicit expressions of emotion . Accordingly , it is important for research to show that implicit measures reveal different attitudes than those revealed explicitly . Just as the amnesic patient shows priming while failing to remember , and the repressive subject shows autonomic arousal while deny - Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 35 | P a g e ing distress , we want to see subjects displaying attitudes or prejudices which they deny having , and acting on stereotypes which they deny holding . Recently , Wittenbrink , Judd , and Park ( 1997 ) performed a formal compari - son of explicit and implicit racial attitudes . Their subjects , all of whom were white , completed a variety of traditional questionnaire measures of self - reported racial attitudes . They also performed a lexical - decision task in which trait terms drawn from racial stereotypes of whites and blacks were primed with the words black , white , or table . Analysis of response latencies found , as would be anticipated from the studies described above , a race - specific priming effect : white speeded lexical judgments of positive traits , while black speeded judgments of negative traits . However , the magnitude of race - specific priming was correlated with scores on the questionnaire measures of racial prejudice . In this study , then , implicit attitudes about race were not dissociated from explicit ones . Such a finding does not under - mine the use of implicit measures in research on attitudes and prejudice ( Dovidio & Fazio , 1992 ) , but a clear demonstration of a dissociation is critical if we are to accept implicit attitudes as evidence of an emotional unconscious whose contents are different from those which are accessible to phenomenal awareness . Neuroscientific Perspectives Desynchrony , repression , alexithymia , hypnotic analgesia , and implicit atti - tudes all seem to represent instances in which the person is subjectively un - aware of an emotional state that nevertheless influences behavioral and physiological outcomes . In view of these phenomena , we propose a formal distinction between two expressions of emotion , explicit and implicit . Paral - leling the usage of these descriptors in the domain of the cognitive uncons - cious , explicit emotion refers to the person ' s conscious awareness of an emotion , feeling , or mood state ; implicit emotion , by contrast , refers to changes in experience , thought , or action that are attributable to one ' s emo - tional state , independent of his or her conscious awareness of that state . In terms of measurement , explicit emotion tasks require the subject to reflect on , and report , his or her conscious feeling states ; implicit emotion tasks do not . Some of the most convincing evidence for emotion as implicit memory is provided by studies of neurological patients who acquire new emotional res - Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 36 | P a g e ponses but who , by virtue of their brain damage , have no conscious recollec - tion of the experiences by which this learning took place . Similarly , strong support for the concept of implicit emotion would be provided by evidence of brain - damaged patients who do not subjectively experience emotional feel - ing states , but who nevertheless display overt behavioral and covert physio - logical responses that would be regarded as emotional . Dissociations among emotion systems would seem a natural topic for study by neuropsycholo - gists , to whom the concept of multiple systems is quite familiar in the do - mains of memory ( e . g . , Schacter & Tulving , 1994 ) and vision ( Ungerleider & Haxby , 1994 ) . Unfortunately , neuropsychological evidence of multiple emotional systems , some supporting conscious feeling states and others supporting unconscious behavioral displays and physiological responses , is hard to come by ( for re - views , see Heilman , Bowers , & Valenstein , 1993 ; Kolb & Wilshaw , 1996 ) . Perhaps this is because the attention of most clinical and experimental neu - ropsychology has been focused on cognitive , rather than emotional and mo - tivational , functions . The terms cognitive neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience will be quite familiar to the readers of this chapter , while the terms affective neuropsychology and emotion neuroscience are rarely heard . The idea of dissociable emotion systems is related to the concept of the emotional brain , as it has evolved from Cannon ( 1929 ) and Bard ( 1929 ) through Papez ( 1937 ) and MacLean ( 1949 ) to LeDoux ( 1996 ) . Cannon and Bard found that decorticate animals would still show fear responses , so long as the thalamus and hypothalamus remained intact . These observations led them to propose that the diencephalon , which contains these structures , was the seat of the emotions . According to their view , the diencephalon mediated skeletal and autonomic emotional responses ; in contrast , the conscious ex - perience of emotion was mediated by the cortex , which was activated by fi - bers ascending from the hypothalamus . In such a system , a disconnection ( Geschwind , 1965 ) between the diencephalon and the cortex would impair the subjective experience of emotion , while leaving the behavioral and phy - siological components intact . Later research and theory broadened the emotional brain to include the en - tire limbic system ( MacLean , 1949 , 1952 ; Papez , 1937 ) - - a move which , ac - cording to one commentary , " had the appeal of combining behavioral phe - nomena having no known neurological substrates with anatomical structures Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 37 | P a g e having no known function " ( Kolb & Wilshaw , 1996 , p . 418 ) . For Papez , the afferent messages arriving at the thalamus were transmitted in two separate streams to the sensory cortex ( the stream of thought ) and to the hypotha - lamus ( the stream of feeling ) . The hypothalamus , in turn , generated skeletal and autonomic responses to the stimulus , and also transmitted sensory in - formation to the cingulate cortex , which also received inputs from the sen - sory cortex . When inputs from the hypothalamus were integrated with inputs from the sensory cortex , an emotional feeling state was generated . In such a system , three different disconnections could create a desynchrony between the explicit subjective and implicit emotion : ( 1 ) between the thalamus and the sensory cortex ; ( 2 ) between the hypothalamus and the cingulate cortex ; and ( 3 ) between the sensory cortex and the cingulate cortex . In any of these cases , the behavioral and physiological responses to an emotional stimulus would run off unimpaired , in the absence of any corresponding subjective feeling state . MacLean ( 1949 , 1952 , 1970 , 1990 ) broadened the limbic system even fur - ther , including the amygdala and other structures connecting directly to the hypothalamus , and proposed that a paleomammalian brain mediates the vis - ceral and emotional life of the ( mammalian ) organism , while the neomam - malian brain mediates consciousness , language , and other complex cognitive functions . Thus , along the lines outlined by Papez ( 1937 ) , a disconnection between the paleomammalian and neomammalian brains could impair expli - cit emotion , while sparing implicit emotion . Most recently , LeDoux ( 1995 , 1996 ) has proposed a variant on the Pa - pez / MacLean theory which has the virtue of being more specific in terms of both anatomy and psychology . Briefly , LeDoux argues that a particular structure in the limbic system , the amygdala , mediates a particular emotion , fear ( for a similar analysis , see Damasio , 1994 ) . Based on his studies of fear conditioning in rats and other nonhuman animals , but supported by studies of human patients who have suffered damage to the amygdala and sur - rounding brain tissue ( e . g . , Adolphs , Damasio , Tranel , & Damasio , 1996 ; LaBar , LeDoux , Spencer , & Phelps , 1995 ) , LeDoux has proposed that fear stimuli are processed by the amygdala , which in turn generates appropriate behavioral , autonomic , and endocrine responses . Cortical arousal , feedback of somatic and visceral information , and information about the fear stimulus are then integrated in working memory to generate the subjective expe - rience of being afraid . As with the simpler systems described by Papez and Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 38 | P a g e MacLean , a disconnection between the amygdala and the cortex can produce a dissociation between explicit and implicit emotion : the person will respond in a fearful manner without feeling fear or anxiety . LeDoux ' s system is espe - cially appealing because it also offers a mechanism by which fear can serve as an implicit expression of memory : if the eliciting stimulus is not represented in working memory , the person will experience fear without be - ing aware of the fear stimulus . It should be understood that LeDoux ' s ( 1995 , 1996 ) analysis of the amygda - la applies only to the fear of emotion . Whereas Papez and MacLean implied that all emotions were mediated by a single system ( Papez ' s circuit or the limbic system ) , LeDoux postulates a number of different systems , each me - diating conscious experience , motor behavior , and somatic changes , corres - ponding to different emotional domains . It is not clear how many such sys - tems there are , but if Ekman and Friesen ( 1975 ) are right that some pat - terns of emotional expression have deep evolutionary roots , a reasonable hypothesis is that there may be at least seven separate systems , corres - ponding to the " basic emotions " of surprise , happiness , sadness , fear , anger , and disgust . Thus , the range of possible dissociations is not just between explicit and implicit expressions of emotion in general . It is may also be possible , at least in principle , to observe in a single patient , desynchrony be - tween explicit and implicit fear , but synchrony between explicit and implicit anger . This is , of course , a nightmare for any prospective researcher of the emotional unconscious . The State and the Stimulus The nightmare is exacerbated by a consideration of the logic of inferring un - conscious emotions . Consider the analogy to implicit memory . We know that priming is evidence of implicit memory because we can trace the facilitation in lexical decision , perceptual identification , and the like , to a specific objec - tively observable event - - the nature of the prime presented to the subject . Furthermore , we can specify objectively the relationship between the prime and the target : same versus different word , same word / same appearance versus same word / different appearance , and so on . Put another way , we can identify an implicit expression of memory because we know what happened to the subject in the past - - what the subject should be remembering . Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 39 | P a g e But by the same logic , in order to identify an implicit expression of emotion , we have to know what emotional state the subject should be experiencing , or which emotional state is being represented , and expressed , outside of conscious awareness . Applying the logic of explicit and implicit memory to the problem of emotion , then , compelling evidence of a dissociation between explicit and implicit emotion makes a number of methodological demands . First , we need to possess an adequate stimulus for emotion - - that is , a set of stimuli which , under ordinary circumstances , reliably elicits particular emotions in subjects . Unfortunately , the search for such reliable elicitors has not been particularly fruitful . Apparently , just as the experience of pain de - pends on the subjective meaning of the pain stimulus , the person ' s emotion - al response to a situation depends greatly on his or her cognitive appraisal of that situation ( e . g . , Ellsworth , 1991 ; Lazarus , 1991 ; Lazarus & Smith , 1988 ; Ortony , Clore , Collins , 1988 ; Smith & Ellsworth , 1985 ) . Still , some fairly universal elicitors of emotion have been proposed , and these hold promise for desynchrony research . Ekman and Friesen ( 1975 ) found , among other relations , that actual or threatened harm elicits fear , while loss of an object to which one was attached induces sadness . Similarly , Scherer , Wallbott , and their colleagues have found , among other relations , that basic pleasures elicited joy , while separation elicited sadness ( Scherer , Wallbott , & Summerfield , 1986 ; Scherer & Wallbott , 1994 ) . To be sure , the relations in question are moderated to some degree by context - specific ap - praisals and cultural considerations , but there is enough cross - situational consistency that we can have some hope of measuring subjects ' subjective , behavioral , and physiological responses to stimuli that , all things being equal , should elicit certain emotions . If we observe diminished subjective awareness coupled with persisting behavioral and physiological responses , we would have evidence of a dissociation between explicit and implicit emo - tion . Of course , documenting such a dissociation also requires that we have relia - ble measures of the subjective , behavioral , and physiological responses to the emotion stimulus ; and these are nontrivial problems . Subjective feeling states can be assessed by the usual sorts of self - report measures , but care must be taken to distinguish between the subjects ' failure to consciously feel a particular emotion , and their willingness to report what they feel to an ex - perimenter . Implicit emotion is about awareness , not denial . The behavioral Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 40 | P a g e component of emotion might be indexed by gross patterns of ap - proach / withdrawal , flight / fight , or activation / inhibition ( Gray , 1987 ) , and the physiological component by generalized levels of autonomic arousal ( Schac - ter & Singer , 1962 ) , but again ideally we would like to have implicit meas - ures that are more specifically isomorphic to the lexicon of conscious emo - tions . On the overt behavioral side , one possibility are facial expressions of the sort documented by Ekman and Friesen ( 1975 ) , as well as cognate post - ural and gestural expression . On the level of covert physiology , Levenson ( 1988 , 1992 ) and his colleagues have been able to document specific pat - terns of autonomic response accompanying particular indices of emotion ( Ekman , Levenson , & Friesen , 1983 ; Levenson , Carstensen , Friesen , & Ek - man , 1991 ; Levenson , Ekman , & Friesen , 1990 ; Levenson , Ekman , Heider , & Friesen , 1988 ) . Similarly , Davidson ( 1993 ) has suggested that particular patterns of cortical activation may also differentiate certain basic emotions . Figure 1 . Emotional state defined by the convergence of eliciting stimulus , subjective experience , expressive behavior , and physiological response . The ideal structure of an experimental demonstration of implicit emotion is now clear . To begin with , we assume that a particular emotional state is a Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 41 | P a g e hypothetical construct defined by the logic of converging operations ( Garner , Hake , & Eriksen , 1956 ; see also Campbell & Fiske , 1956 ; Kihlstrom , 1984 ; Stoyva & Kamiya , 1968 ) . These operations include specification of an elicit - ing stimulus and the measurement of subjecive experience , overt behavior , and physiological response ( Figure 1 ) . When all operations agree , we can be fairly confident that the person is in an emotional state such as fear or happiness . Agreement among the operations is sufficient to establish the presence of an emotional state . However , none of these operations is necessary for this purpose , and under some circums - tances some combination of two or three operations would sufficient . For ex - ample , a subject might report feeling no fear in response to a real or im - agined threat . At the same time , he or she should show continue to manifest facial , postural , and gestural expressions of fear , as well as autonomic and cortical signs of fear . Under these circumstances , the diagnosis of implicit fear might well be irresistible . As we grow more confident with respect to classification of emotional stimuli , and multivariate measurement of emo - tional responses , we will be in a better position both to evaluate the mul - tiple - systems theory of emotion and to search for evidence of desynchronies between emotional systems - - especially the particular pattern ( s ) of desyn - chrony characteristic of a dissociation between explicit and implicit emotion . Cognition , Emotion , Consciousness , and the Self So now we have an overview of what the emotional unconscious might look like . The research is not definitive , not by a long shot , but there do seem to be a number of well - documented instances in which current or past events influence our emotional states outside of phenomenal awareness , and another set of plausible instances where emotional responses themselves af - fect experience , thought , and action outside phenomenal awareness . Accept - ing such conclusions , even for the sake of argument , leads to the further question of what makes the difference between those cognitions and emo - tions that are conscious and those that are not . One possibility , raised by Schacter ( 1990 ) , is that there is some sort of cog - nitive module , which he calls the Conscious Awareness System ( CAS ) , cor - responding to a brain module or a system of modules , that has connections to other modular systems involved in perception , memory , language , emo - tion , and other mental functions . Damage to CAS , or more likely to the con - Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 42 | P a g e nections between it and other systems , will produce a loss of conscious awareness ; but it will not produce a complete loss of function . Thus , for ex - ample , if the connection between CAS and the visual system is broken , the person will not be aware of seeing ; but may still respond to visual events - - the sort of thing that occurs in the neuropsychological syndrome of blind - sight . If the connection between CAS and the episodic memory system is broken , the person will be unaware of past events ; but may still be influ - enced by the past , in the form of implicit memory , as has been observed in the organic amnesic syndromes . By extension , a disconnection between CAS and an emotion system would prevent the person from being aware of his or her emotional states , at the same time as behavioral and physiological com - ponents of emotional response run off outside of conscious awareness . The system proposed by LeDoux ( 1996 ) , while rather more complicated , has some of the same flavor . At the psychological level of analysis , staying very close to phenomenal ex - perience , the kinds of dissociations discussed here may be mediated by as - sociations between various mental representations of experience , and the mental representation of the self as the agent or patient of some action , or as the stimulus or experiencer of some state ( Kihlstrom , 1993c , 1997a ) . This proposal , in turn , is stimulated by James ' s ( 1890 / 1980 ) comment that : The universal conscious fact is not ' feelings and thoughts exist ' , but ' I think ' and ' I feel ' ( p . 221 , italics original ) . According to James , consciousness comes when we take possession of our behaviors , thoughts , feelings and desires - - in other words , when we ac - knowledge them as our own , or inject ourselves into them . Janet ( 1907 ) articulated similar ideas about the role of the self in conscious - ness , employing an early metaphor for spreading activation : There are then in the [ statement ] " I feel " , two things in presence of each other : a small , new , psychological fact , a little flame lighting up - - ' feel " - - and an enormous mass of thoughts already constituted into a system - - " I " ( pp . 304 - 305 ) . So too , consider the great French neurologist Claparede ( 1911 ; see Kihlstrom , 1995a ) , discussing a classic early case of what we now call impli - cit memory : Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 43 | P a g e If one examines the behavior of such a patient , one finds that everything happens as though the various events of life , however well associated with each other in the mind , were incapable of integration with the me itself ( p . 71 ) . Figure 2 . Mental representation of self linked to co - activated mental repre - sentations of an event , its episodic context , and emotional state ( A ) . When the link between self and event is disrupted ( B ) , emotional state is an ex - pression of implicit perception or memory . When the link between self and emotion is disrupted ( C ) , expressive behavior and physiological activity serve as implicit expressions of emotion . This connection to the self is just what appears to be lacking in the pheno - mena of implicit cognition and emotion . When we perceive an event , assume that we activate fragments of pre - existing knowledge ; when we attend to the event , its mental representation becomes part of our working memory , Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 44 | P a g e along with information about our emotional reaction to the event . These ac - tivated knowledge structures then have the opportunity to contact other ac - tivated knowledge structures . Among these are the person ' s current processing goals , the current spatiotemporal context , and the self . This self - structure , resident in working memory , routinely comes into contact with other activated pieces of knowledge - - about the environment in which the person exists , current and past events , and other information activated by perceptual processing , memory retrieval , and other acts of thought . This connection , which defines the self as the agent or experiencer of some ongo - ing event , or the stimulus or experiencer of some state , is the key to con - sciousness . The cognitive situation is schematically depicted in Figure 2 . Consider what happens when an event is perceived or remembered which generates an emotional response . Under ordinary circumstances , the event , its surrounding context , and the emotional response all make contact with the self in working memory , and all are represented in consciousness ( Figure 2a ) . The person knows what he or she feels , and knows why . Now consider what happens if the subjective component of the emotional re - sponse connects to the self , but the representation of the instigating event does not ( Figure 2b ) . Under these circumstances , the person will be aware of the situational background , his or her emotional state will be experienced consciously , and the behavioral and physiological consequences of that state will run off unimpaired . But the person will not know why he feels what he feels , because he is not aware of the instigating event perceived in the present , or retrieved from the past . This is the usual form of a state of dis - sociation , reflecting an impairment of explicit perception or memory , with the emotional response reflecting spared implicit memory . Under other circumstances , the representation of the instigating event will connect to the self , but the representation of the emotional state may not - - although the behavioral and physiological components of the emotion will run off activity , but the emotion itself will not be experienced consciously ( Figure 2c ) . The result will be a state of desynchrony , reflecting an impair - ment of explicit emotion , while implicit emotion , in the form of expressive behavior and physiological changes , will be spared .

The emotional unconscious , then , has two different aspects . On the one hand , we may be unaware of the percepts , memories , and thoughts which give rise to our emotional feelings . In this case , emotion serves as an impli - cit expression of perception , memory , learning , or thought . On the other hand , we may be aware of what we are perceiving , remembering , and think - ing , but unaware of the emotions instigated by these cognitions . In this case , behavioral and physiological changes serve as implicit expressions of emotion . But can emotions really be unconscious ? A recent symposium answered this question in the negative ( Clore , 1994 ; Davidson & Ekman , 1994 ; LeDoux , 1994 ; Zajonc , 1994 ) . There was general agreement that the cognitive and brain processes underlying emotions could operate outside of conscious awareness and conscious control . In this way , we might not be conscious of the source of our emotions ; and , in the absence of source awareness , we might not be aware of precisely which emotion we are experiencing . But as Clore put it , the essence of emotion is feeling , and " emotions that are felt cannot be unconscious by definition " ( 1994 , p . 285 ) . And if , as Clore and Schwarz ( Clore , 1992 ; Clore , Schwarz , & Conway , 1994 ; Schwarz & Clore , 1983 , 1988 ) propose , the function of emotion is to provide information con - cerning the appraisal and evaluation of the ( past , current , or anticipated fu - ture ) situation , it would certainly be dysfunctional if emotions were uncons - cious . On the other hand , if it is true , as James ( 1884 ; 1890 / 1980 ) famously ar - gued , that ( 1 ) emotion is the perception of bodily ( muscular and visceral ) activity ; and ( 2 ) perception can be unconscious , as seems to be the case from the litera - ture documenting dissociations between explicit and implicit perception ( Kihlstrom et al . , 1992a ) ; then Retrieved on 21 September 2011 from http : / / ist - socrates . berkeley . edu / ~ kihlstrm / Eich2000 . htm 46 | P a g e ( 3 ) emotions can be unconscious , at least in principle , and can express themselves outside awareness via overt behavioral and covert physiological responses . While the experimental and clinical evidence for a dissociation between ex - plicit and implicit emotion is not yet convincing , and the methodological re - quirements for such a demonstration have not yet been met , the hypothesis of unconscious emotional states cannot be rejected out of hand . If we are willing to speak of implicit percepts , memories , and thoughts that are disso - ciated from their explicit counterparts , then we must be willing to speak of implicit emotions in the same terms as well . It does not matter whether un - conscious emotions would be dysfunctional . What matters is whether they can happen , how they can happen , and how we would know .

I . The self , as Janet ( 1907 ) noted , is a very rich mental structure . In the social intelligence theory of personality ( Cantor & Kihlstrom , 1987 , 1989 ; Kihlstrom & Cantor , 1989 ) , the self is an organized knowledge structure that stores what one knows about oneself . This would include semantic knowledge about one ' s physical and personality attributes , social status , and the like . It is also tightly linked to episodic knowledge forming one ' s autobiographical history ; autobiographical memories must represent the self , by definition ( Kihlstrom & Can - tor , 1984 ; Kihlstrom et al . , 1988 ; Kihlstrom & Klein , 1994 , 1997 ; Kihlstrom , Marchese , & Klein , 1997 ) .
