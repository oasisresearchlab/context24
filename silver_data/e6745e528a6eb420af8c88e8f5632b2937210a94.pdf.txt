Schools were kept open to children of key workers and vulnerable children on a voluntary basis . Starting 1 June 2020 , children in reception ( 4 – 5 years old ) , year 1 ( 5 – 6 years old ) and year 6 ( 10 – 11 years old ) also became eligible to attend school . Methods 1373 parents or guardians of children eligible to attend school completed a cross - sectional survey between 8 and 11 June 2020 . We investigated factors associated with whether children attended school or not . Results 46 % ( n = 370 / 803 ) of children in year groups eligible to attend school and 13 % ( n = 72 / 570 ) of children of key workers had attended school in the past 7 days . The most common reasons for sending children to school were that the child’s education would benefit , the child wanted to go to school and the parent needed to work . A child was significantly more likely to attend if the parent believed the child had already had COVID - 19 , they had special educational needs or a person in the household had COVID - 19 symptoms . Conclusions Following any future school closure , helping parents to feel comfortable returning their child to school will require policy makers and school leaders to communicate about the adequacy of their policies to : ( A ) ensure that the risk to children in school is minimised ; ( B ) ensure that the educational potential within schools is maximised ; and ( C ) ensure that the benefits of school for the psychological well - being of children are prioritised . INTRODUCTION On 23 March 2020 , a nationwide closure of schools occurred across England in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic . Only vulnerable children ( those with a healthcare plan or social worker ) and children of key workers ( critical to the COVID - 19 response ) were able to attend . 1 2 From 1 June 2020 , children in reception ( 4 – 5 years ) , year 1 ( 5 – 6 years ) and year 6 ( 10 – 11 years ) also became eligible to attend . 3 Until September 2020 , school attend - ance was voluntary to those children eligible to attend . 4 The benefits of closing schools to reduce the transmission of COVID - 19 and the nega - tive consequences of doing so were diffi - cult to balance . 5 6 Adding to the debate was emerging evidence of a low transmission rate of COVID - 19 among children 7 – 10 and a recognition that outbreaks may occur none - theless . 11 12 Irrespective of this debate , it was clear that many parents felt far from comfortable with their children attending school in the first months of the pandemic , even where it was encouraged . 13 A worldwide systematic review of school closures suggests several factors that may be relevant to whether a child attended school during an infectious disease outbreak . 14 Nineteen papers were included in What is known about the subject ? ► The COVID - 19 pandemic resulted in the mass clo - sure of schools for an extended period of time . A pre - vious systematic review assessed parental attitudes towards smaller scale closures , finding that many parents ( 71 % – 97 % across six studies ) approved of closures , particularly where they were seen as an ef - fective protective measure against a serious illness . The effect on a child’s education and ability of the parent to work were reported as concerns . What this study adds ? ► During the partial reopening of schools in England in June 2020 , most parents did not send their chil - dren to school . Parents who were not educated to degree level , not working , who lived in the North of England or who were from black , Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds were least likely to send their children back . Perceived benefits of education , risk of disease and children’s well - being were the main drivers in determining parental decision to send them to school or not . 2 Woodland L , et al . BMJ Paediatrics Open 2021 ; 5 : e001014 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjpo - 2020 - 001014 Open access the review , samples representing between 67 and 4171 school - aged children ( 5 – 19 years ) . Perceived risk of infection , 15 16 concern about the impact of a closure on education 15 17 and parental concerns about their child’s mental health were key issues . 18 Understanding the key issues that determine whether a parent is willing to send their children back to school when it is partially open , and ensuring that school policies and communications address these concerns , should help inform reopening schools , in this or any future pandemic . In this study , we investigated factors associated with a parent’s willingness to send their child to school when they partially reopened , following closures due to the COVID - 19 pandemic . We investigated these factors for children in reception , year 1 or year 6 and for families where at least one parent was a key worker . METHODSDesign We commissioned a market research company , BMG Research , to administer a cross - sectional survey 1 week after schools in England reopened for children in recep - tion , year 1 and year 6 ( 8 – 11 June 2020 ) . 19 We have previ - ously reported data from this survey relating to parental perceptions of the presence of hygiene procedures within schools . 20 Participants Participants ( n = 2447 ) were recruited from BMG Research’s panel , and to achieve a sample broadly repre - sentative of the population , BMG Research monitored region , child age , child gender , parent / guardian age and parent / guardian gender . Participants were eligible for the study if they were aged 18 years or over , lived in England and were a parent or guardian to a school - aged child ( 4 – 18 years ) who usually lived with them . One hundred and eighty - three participants were screened out for non - eligibility , 226 participants dropped out after starting the survey and 28 completed but were removed for quality control such as completing the survey quickly or for ‘straight - lining’ ( selecting the same option for every question ) suggesting inattention to the questions . A total of 2010 participants remained . The sample fell within five percentage points of the national popula - tion by the child’s gender , key stage and type of school attended against the known distribution for school chil - dren in England . 21 The sample used in this paper were 803 parents of children in eligible school years and 570 parents from families in which at least one parent was a key worker ( nine participants were removed from this group due to logical inconsistencies which suggested they had accidently completed the wrong section ) . Participants were paid equivalent to £0 . 60 . Study materials The full survey is available in the online supplemental materials . All participants answered questions referring to their child who had the most recent birthday . In cases where children shared a birthday , we asked the parent to select one child . Our survey had two sections . Section 1 was only completed by parents who had a child in reception , year 1 or year 6 or by parents who did not have a child in these year groups , but they or their spouse were a key worker . It contained questions about whether the child had attended school in the past week . Section 2 was completed by these parents and also by parents who did not have a child eligible to attend school . It contained general questions on views about risk of COVID - 19 , family living and school safety measures . In this paper , we only report data from section 1 , relating to actual atten - dance in the past week . Personal characteristics We asked participants to report their gender , age , region , household income , employment status , marital status , ethnicity and level of education . We also asked whether anyone within the household was aged over 70 years or had a health condition that made them vulnerable to COVID - 19 . We asked participants to report the child’s gender , age , school year , school type ( fee paying or state funded ) and whether the child had special educational needs ( SENs ) . School attendance Participants were asked how many times the child had attended school in the past 7 days . Depending on the response , parents were presented with randomised state - ments : 10 for why they were sending the child to school ; 12 for why they were only sending the child to school part - time ; or 16 why their child was not attending school . We asked participants to ‘tick any [ statement ] that applies’ . Participants also had the option to write - in text for ‘other reason’ . COVID - 19 symptoms We asked participants to report if the selected child had experienced any symptoms ‘in the past 7 days’ from a list of 10 symptoms . We also asked if they or a household member ( other than the child ) had experienced symp - toms ‘in the past 14 days’ from the same symptom list . We asked participants whether they thought their child had had COVID - 19 . Well - being We asked participants to report the child’s well - being using two subscales from the Revised Child Anxiety Disorder Scale ( RCADS ) : 22 the generalised anxiety disorder ( GAD ) subscale and the major depressive disorder ( MDD ) subscale . Patient and public involvement A school trustee contributed to the development of the survey materials and coauthored this paper . 3 Woodland L , et al . BMJ Paediatrics Open 2021 ; 5 : e001014 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjpo - 2020 - 001014 Open access ANALYSISRecoding of variables School attendance was defined as a child who attended school for at least 1 day in the past 7 days . We created two binary variables to indicate whether the child , and someone in the household ( other than the child ) , had a health condition that might make them particularly vulnerable to COVID - 19 . We created two binary variables to indicate recent pres - ence of COVID - 19 symptoms in the child and someone else in the household . We defined presence of COVID - 19 symptoms as experiencing a ‘new , continuous cough’ , ‘high temperature / fever’ , ‘loss of sense of smell ( fully or partial ) ’ or ‘loss of taste’ . We coded a binary variable for the parent’s perception of whether the child had had COVID - 19 by grouping together ‘they have definitely had it or definitely have it now’ and ‘they have probably had it or probably have it now’ . We created a binary variable to indicate low well - being in the child . We assigned a value against each answer from 0 ( ‘never’ ) to 3 ( ‘always’ ) on the GAD and MDD RCADS subscales and created a total score for each subscale . We then turned each total score into a t - score , a method used to normalise RCADS scores within the population , by child’s age and gender . 22 23 We used the same process for reception to year 3 as for year 4 . We used a t - score cut - off of 65 or above on either GAD or MDD subscales to indicate low well - being . For all variables , we coded the responses ‘don’t know’ , ‘not applicable’ , ‘prefer not to say’ and ‘prefer to self - describe’ as missing data . Analysis We ran a series of binary logistic regressions using SPSS V . 26 . 0 , 24 investigating univariable associations between each of our predictor variables and sending the child to school . We ran a second set of binary logistic regressions controlling for personal characteristics shown in the results . We analysed frequencies for the statements responding to sending the child to school for a full week ( 5 days ) , part - time ( less than 5 days ) and for not sending the child to school . For ease of interpretation , we used unweighted data in our analysis . We applied a Bonferroni correction to our results ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) due to running many analyses ( children in school years n = 29 and children of key workers n = 31 ) . Results meeting this criterion are marked by a dagger ( † ) in the tables . Sample size calculation Post hoc calculations were run on the two subsamples that had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 % at the 95 % confidence level for each prevalence estimate . RESULTSSchool attendance Nearly half ( 46 % , 95 % CI 43 % to 50 % , n = 370 / 803 ) of children in eligible school years had attended school and about half had not ( 54 % , 95 % CI 50 % to 57 % , n = 432 / 803 ) . One participant was unsure if the child had attended school . The most common reasons for not sending a child to school were : thinking it was too risky for the child to attend school ( n = 223 , 52 % ) , the school not being open ( n = 140 , 32 % ) and having another child who could not go to school ( n = 67 , 16 % ) . The most common reasons for sending a child to school were : the child’s education would benefit ( n = 208 , 56 % ) , the child wants to go to school ( n = 200 , 54 % ) and the child will benefit from seeing their friends ( n = 187 , 51 % ) . Of participants whose child did not attend school for a full week ( n = 204 , 25 % ) , the most common reasons for partial attendance were : the school only offers them to be in part - time ( n = 80 , 39 % ) , it is less risky for them to be in part - time ( n = 40 , 20 % ) and parent only sending them in on days where the lessons are important ( n = 28 , 14 % ) . Only 13 % ( 95 % CI 10 % to 15 % , n = 72 / 570 ) of children of key workers had attended school , most children had not ( 87 % , 95 % CI 85 % to 90 % , n = 497 / 570 ) . One participant was unsure if the child had attended school . The most common reasons for children not attending school were : the school was not open ( n = 259 , 52 % ) , the school had asked the child not to attend ( n = 117 , 24 % ) and thinking that it was too risky for the child to attend school at the moment ( n = 109 , 22 % ) . The most common reasons for attending school were : the parent needing to work ( n = 40 , 56 % ) , the child wanting to go to school ( n = 35 , 49 % ) and thinking that the child’s education would benefit from being at school ( n = 30 , 42 % ) . Of participants with children who attended school part - time , the most common reasons were : the school only offered them to be in part - time ( n = 16 , 41 % ) , parent only sent them in on days where the lessons are important ( n = 8 , 21 % ) and believing it was less risky for them to be in part - time ( n = 7 , 18 % ) . Associations Participant characteristics for children in eligible school years and for children of key workers are shown in table 1 . Parents of children in eligible school years were less likely to send the child to school if they were educated to A - level or below , not working , of black , Asian and minority ethnicity ( BAME ) or living in the North East , North West and Yorkshire and the Humber compared with London , whereas children of key workers were more likely to attend school for participants aged 45 years and under and who were working . Child attendance was more likely for children in eligible school years when in a fee - paying school and if they had a health condition that made them vulnerable to COVID - 19 . For both groups , attendance was more likely for children who had SENs , reported low well - being , thought their child had had COVID - 19 and when a person over 70 years was living in the household . There was also a significant association in both groups between a child being more likely to attend school and the child having experienced COVID - 19 symptoms in the past 7 days or another person in the household having experienced COVID - 19 symptoms in the past 14 days . 4 Woodland L , et al .

BMJ Paediatrics Open 2021 ; 5 : e001014 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjpo - 2020 - 001014 Open access DISCUSSION Most children eligible to attend school did not attend 1 week after schools in England began to reopen to more children . 25 Worryingly , we observed patterns that seemed likely to entrench existing educational inequalities . Chil - dren from households where parents have lower educa - tion achievements , BAME households and households in the North of England and state funded being least likely to attend school . Our results suggest that several broad areas determined attendance at school . First , risk perceptions were crucial . The response ‘it is too risky’ featured highly in parental reasons for not sending children to school . Second , chil - dren were also more likely to attend school when parents thought their child had had COVID - 19 which could indi - cate the belief their child is immune to further infec - tion . 26 Unexpectedly , children were more likely to attend school when they had a health condition that made them vulnerable to COVID - 19 and when a person over 70 years was living in the household . We speculate that this may be because these circumstances affect the parent’s ability to look after the child at home . Poorer perceived child well - being was associated with them being more likely to attend school . This finding may reflect parental desire to improve their child’s well - being that may have been impacted by the school closure . 27 This was also apparent in reasons parents gave for sending their child to school . As expected , 14 concerns about education also featured highly as a reason for attendance , while perceptions that schools could not provide good quality education or that some lessons were not as important were cited as reasons for absence or partial attendance . Despite most children of key workers not attending school , needing to work was the most reported reason for school attendance , and the school not opening or asking the child not to attend were the most commonly reported reasons for the child not being in school . This suggests that work commitments were the main driver for this group . One notable finding was that children who had symp - toms of COVID - 19 in the past 7 days or whose house - hold members had these symptoms in the past 14 days were significantly more likely to have gone to school . We do not know if the child attended school while having symptoms or when symptoms were present in the house - hold ( against self - isolation guidance ) . 28 However , given that school closure is specifically designed to reduce the transmission of respiratory infections in general , it is also possible that this reflects the re - emergence of transmission of upper respiratory tract infections , or COVID - 19 specifically , within the school environment . 29 It may also reflect increased anxiety or awareness among parents around COVID - 19 symptoms , resulting in higher symptom detection and reporting . Limitations Several limitations should be borne in mind for this study . First the cross - sectional nature of this study limits our ability to draw causal findings . Second , the RCADS subscale was used to indicate low well - being but is currently not validated for children under 8 years . 30 Third , online polls can be unrepresentative and lead to response and self - reporting bias . 31 However , in line with the reasoning relating to the use of non - probability samples in social sciences , 32 we assume that the associations within our data do generalise to the wider population . Fourth , we ran many analyses raising the possibility of type 1 errors . While we have provided Bonferroni corrections in the tables for readers who wish to correct this , this correction in turn may be overly conservative . CONCLUSION Our findings support previous research by suggesting that during an infectious disease outbreak , parents’ deci - sion to send their child to school was impacted by the risk of disease ( COVID - 19 ) , child’s education and well - being . Furthermore , without reassuring parents in these three areas and encouraging them to send their children to school health inequalities are likely to be increased .
