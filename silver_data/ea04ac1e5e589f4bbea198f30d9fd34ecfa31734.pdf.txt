The proteins of the ERM family , ezrin , radixin , and moesin , are central to these processes by linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton . To investigate the individual contributions of these three proteins to leukocyte migration , we generated single and triple ERM knock - out macrophages . Surprisingly , we found that even in the absence of ERMs , macrophages can still form the different actin structures promoting cell migration , such as filopodia , lamellipodia , podosomes , and ruffles . Furthermore we discovered that , unlike every other cell type previously investigated , the single or triple knock - out of ERMs does not affect macrophage migration in a large diversity of contexts . Finally , we demonstrated that the loss of ERMs in macrophages does not affect the mechanics of their actin cortex . These findings challenge the notion that 2 ERMs are universally essential for cortex mechanics and cell migration and support the notion that the macrophage cortex may have diverged from that of other cells to allow for their adaptive cortical plasticity . Introduction The actin cytoskeleton plays a major role to support the cell shape changes necessary for diverse biological processes such as morphogenesis , mitosis , phagocytosis and cell migration . The cellular cortex is organized in a thin actomyosin layer located just beneath the plasma membrane . The precise organization and regulation of this dynamic structure is critical for physiological processes , as disruptions of the actin cortex have been linked to different pathologies , such as cancer ( Chugh and Paluch , 2018 ) . Membrane - cortex attachment is essential for the regulation of mechanical properties and dynamics of the cortex , essential for processes such as mitosis ( Carreno et al . , 2008 ; Kunda et al . , 2012 , 2008 ; Leguay et al . , 2022 ; Roch et al . , 2010 ; Roubinet et al . , 2011 ) or the formation of actin - driven and bleb - based protrusions during cell migration ( Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2010 ; Welf et al . , 2020 ) . Ezrin , radixin and moesin compose the ERM protein family and are one of the main mechanical linkers between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton ( Bretscher , 1983 ; Bretscher et al . , 1997 ; Lankes and Furthmayr , 1991 ; Tsukita et al . , 1989 ) . As such , ERM activation at mitotic entry was shown to promote rounding of metaphase cells by increasing stiffening of the cortex ( Kunda et al . , 2008 ; Larson et al . , 2010 ; Leguay et al . , 2022 ) . By solidifying the actin - to - membrane link , ERMs also increase membrane tension in mesendodermal progenitors of zebrafish embryos , epithelial cells , and lymphocytes ( Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2010 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ; Rouven Brückner et al . , 2015 ; Tsujita et al . , 2021 ) . Having a key role in the link between the plasma membrane and the actomyosin cortex , ERMs control the organization and dynamics of thin actin structures such as brush border microvilli of epithelial cells ( Bonilha et al . , 2006 ; Crepaldi et al . , 1997 ; Saotome et al . , 2004 ) , filopodia of neural growth cones ( Furutani et al . , 2007 ; Gallo , 2008 ) , or migrating cancer cells ( Li et al . , 2017 ; Moodley et al . , 2020 ) . On the contrary , ERM deactivation induces a low membrane - cortex attachment , promoting bleb formation in migrating zebrafish progenitors during gastrulation ( Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2016 , 2010 ; Olguin - Olguin et al . , 2021 ) or during division of drosophila cells ( Kunda et al . , 2008 ; Roubinet et al . , 2011 ) . The individual roles of ezrin , radixin , and moesin have been studied without distinction , resulting in a limited understanding of their unique functions within the same cell . To bridge this knowledge gap , we aimed to investigate the specific contributions of each ERM to macrophage migration . Macrophages are innate immune cells that represent the archetype of 3 the plastic cell capable of infiltrating every tissue of the organism to maintain immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis . Unlike other leukocytes , which rely solely on the protease - independent amoeboid mode of migration ( Cougoule et al . , 2010 ; Lämmermann et al . , 2008 ) , macrophages adapt their motility strategy to their external environment . In addition to the amoeboid mode , macrophages are capable of infiltrating dense matrices by using a protease - dependent mesenchymal migration that relies on adhesive podosome actin structures ( Gui et al . , 2018 ; Van Goethem et al . , 2011 , 2010 ) . Surprisingly , we found that ERMs are dispensable for macrophages to migrate in diverse contexts , including in vitro 2D migration and 3D invasion of extracellular matrix , ex vivo tissue infiltration through healthy dermis and tumor tissue , or in vivo diapedesis . We further show that neither the thickness nor the mechanics of the actin cortex of macrophage are affected by ERM knock - out . Results and discussion The deletion of ezrin , radixin , or moesin does not affect macrophage 3D migration . In order to investigate the function of ERM proteins in macrophages , we first determined which ERM are expressed in these cells . We confirmed that moesin ( Msn ) and ezrin ( Ezr ) , but not radixin ( Rdx ) are expressed in monocytes ( Shcherbina et al . , 1999 ) . We also showed that all three ERMs are expressed in human blood monocytes derived macrophages ( HMDM ) ( Fig 1A , B ) . ERMs were also found in macrophages in their phosphorylated , active form ( P - ERM ) , that links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton ( Bretscher et al . , 1997 ; Matsui et al . , 1998 ; Pelaseyed et al . , 2017 ) . We then investigated the localization of ERM proteins in macrophages . For this purpose , we transfected ezrin - , radixin - , and moesin - GFP into human monocyte - derived macrophages ( HMDM ) . All three ERMs localized predominantly at the plasma membrane and decorated membrane ruffles ( Fig S1 , Movie1 - 6 ) . Of note , ezrin , but neither radixin nor moesin , was also slightly enriched around podosome cores ( Fig S1 , A , Movie1 , 4 ) . Live observations also revealed that nascent , peripheral , ruffles were enriched in actin filaments , whereas Ezrin , Radixin and Moesin accumulated indifferently on nascent and older , more central , ruffles ( Fig S1 , D , Movie4 - 6 ) . Moesin being described as the most abundant ERM expressed in leukocytes ( Shcherbina et al . , 1999 ) , we then knocked down the expression of moesin in HMDM using small interfering - RNAs ( siRNA ) . siRNA treatments resulted in an 80 % ± 5 % moesin depletion ( mean ± SD ) , ( Fig 1C ) . Surprisingly , we found that moesin - depleted human macrophages and wild - type HMDMs exhibited similar levels of infiltration into 3D fibrillar collagen I , an extracellular matrix that promotes the amoeboid mode of motility in macrophages ( Van Goethem et al . , 2010 ) ( Fig 1D ) . We also observed that in Matrigel , which promotes protease - dependent mesenchymal 4 migration of macrophages ( Van Goethem et al . , 2010 ) , moesin is dispensable for these cells to infiltrate this extracellular matrix ( Fig 1E ) . Yet , a small residual amount of moesin after siRNA may be sufficient to ensure its function . In addition , ezrin and radixin could also potentially replace moesin loss . We therefore decided to knock - out each ERMs using CRISPR - Cas9 gene edition . We took advantage of an HoxB8 - immortalized murine line of macrophage progenitors , which allows an easy and fast generation of progenitors genetically depleted for any gene of interest ( Accarias et al . , 2020 ) . We first demonstrated that all three ERMs are expressed in mouse HoxB8 - macrophages ( Fig 1F , G ) , moesin being the most expressed and phosphorylated ERM ( Fig 1F ) . We first knocked out ezrin , radixin , or moesin individually in hoxB8 progenitors by CRISPR - Cas9 . As a control , we used sgRNA targeting the non - expressed luciferase protein , hereafter referred as WT . We achieved a depletion of 89 % , 85 % and 97 % for ezrin , radixin or moesin , respectively , in multiclonal populations of macrophages individually knocked - out for ERMs ( Fig 1H ) . Notably , moesin was the main expressed ERM in macrophages , as evidenced by the lack of detectable western blot signal for ERMs using the pan - ERM antibody in moesin knock - out HoxB8 macrophages . Moreover , among the three ERMs , only moesin knock - out resulted in a significant decrease in P - ERM , suggesting that moesin is also the main activated ERM in HoxB8 macrophages . Our findings were again unexpected as we discovered that the individual knock - out of any ERM did not affect the 3D migration of macrophages in either collagen I nor in Matrigel ( Fig 1I , J ) . Since the three ERM proteins exhibit high structural similarity and function , it is possible that the other ERMs in each single knock - out compensate for the loss of the knocked - out ERM . To test this hypothesis , we decided to simultaneously knock out all three ERM proteins in HoxB8 macrophage progenitors . The triple KO of ezrin , radixin , and moesin does not significantly affect the formation and dynamics of actin structures in macrophage . We generated a triple knockout of the ezrin , radixin and moesin proteins in HoxB8 myeloid progenitors . We isolated three different clonal populations where all three ERM proteins were fully depleted , as validated by immunoblot analysis ( Fig 2A ) , and genomic DNA sequencing ( Fig S2 ) , and refer to them as ERM - tKO ( clones # 1 , # 2 and # 3 ) . To control for potential off - target effects of CRISPR - Cas9 editing , we selected three independent clones that had different genomic mutations in their ezrin , radixin and moesin genes . As ERMs were found to control the formation and dynamics of diverse actin protrusions ( Brown et al . , 2003 ; Furutani et al . , 2007 ; Saotome et al . , 2004 ) , we first quantified the formation of these actin structures in ERM - tKO macrophages and progenitors ( Fig 2B - G ) . We observed 5 that both WT and ERM - TKO progenitors formed a similar number of microvilli - , filopodia - and ruffle - like short protrusions on glass coverslips , as revealed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Fig 2B ) . We then found that the ERM - tKO macrophages spread efficiently on bare glass surface in a similar manner than WT macrophages , as demonstrated by their comparable cell area ( WT : 916±27 µm 2 ; TKO : 884±32 µm 2 , mean±SEM ) and circularity ( WT : 0 , 18±0 , 007 ; TKO : 0 , 19±0 , 008 ) compared to the WT ( Fig 2D ) . We also measured that they form the same number of large lamellipodia ( Fig 2C ) , and thin filopodia protrusions ( WT : 10 , 7±1 , 2 filopodia per cell ; TKO : 9 , 8±1 , 6 ) , although the latter are slightly longer in the ERM - tKO macrophages ( 4 , 9±0 , 25 µm , mean±SEM , compared to 4 , 0±0 , 23 µm in WT macrophages ) ( Fig 2E ) . The number of podosomes was also slightly reduced in the ERM - tKO ( 50±2 podosomes / cell ; mean±SEM ) compared to WT macrophages ( 69±3 ) ( Fig 2F ) , but their dynamics remained unaffected ( Fig 2G , Movie 7 ) . Overall , the absence of ERM proteins in macrophages does not impair the ability of these cells to form the various actin structures involved in migration . Although we observed a slight reduction in the density of podosomes and a slight increase in the length of filopodia , these alterations do not substantially affect the overall formation of actin cortical structures in ERM - deficient macrophages . This contrasts with the microvilli collapse observed in ezrin / moesin double KO in neutrophils and lymphocytes from Moesin Y / - mice ( Brown et al . , 2003 ; Hirata et al . , 2012 ; Panicker et al . , 2020 ) , and suggests that these small protrusions might not have the same molecular composition in lymphocytes and neutrophils compared to monocyte progenitors . To investigate whether these modest alterations could affect macrophage migration , we first investigated the ability of ERM - deficient macrophages to migrate randomly on 2D glass , or in response to a gradient of complement 5a ( C5a ) as a chemoattractant . We found that there were no significant differences in the average velocity ( means of WT , 2 . 6 µm / min ; tKO # 1 , 2 . 45 µm / min ; tKO # 2 , 2 . 62 µm / min ; tKO # 3 , 2 . 36 µm / min ) and confinement ratio ( WT : 0 . 20±0 . 02 ; tKO # 1 , 0 . 14±0 . 02 ; tKO # 2 , 0 . 18±0 . 02 ; tKO # 3 , 0 . 19±0 . 01 ; mean±SEM ) of the 3 ERM - tKO clones and the WT macrophages ( Fig 2H and movie 8 ) . ERM - tKO macrophages were also perfectly able to perform chemotaxis toward C5a without any defects in their velocity , directionality or their chemotaxis index ( Fig S4 and movie 9 ) . The 3D infiltration of macrophages in vitro remains unaffected by the loss of ezrin , radixin , and moesin . As macrophage migrate in vivo mostly in a tridimensional context we next aimed to test whether ERMs could regulate 3D migration . We previously reported that when invading 6 collagen I , macrophages rely solely on the protease - independent amoeboid mode of migration while they use protease - dependent mesenchymal migration when they invade Matrigel . We found that ERMs were dispensable for both mode of invasions . All three ERM - tKO clones infiltrated both collagen I ( Fig 3A , B ) and Matrigel ( Fig 3C , D ) similarly to WT macrophages . Live imaging of WT and ERM - tKO macrophages in 3D collagen I and Matrigel confirmed that ERM depletion did not affect invasion of macrophages ( Movies 10 - 13 ) . In addition , using live super - resolution imaging of WT and ERM - tKO macrophages stably expressing lifeact - GFP , we found that in 3D collagen , the ruffles formed by tKO macrophages retract at the same rate than WT macrophages , showing that ERMs are not necessary for the dynamics of these actin structures ( Fig 3E - H and movies 14 and 15 ) . Macrophages without ezrin , radixin , and moesin exhibit no impairment in their ability to perform diapedesis and infiltrate the ear derma or fibrosarcoma . To further investigate the migratory properties of ERM - deficient macrophages in vivo , we first assessed their ability to perform diapedesis into mice bearing a fibrosarcoma to induce a major recruitment of monocytes within this tumor ( Gui et al . , 2018 ) . Indeed , moesin - deficient neutrophils are impaired for diapedesis ( Liu et al . , 2015 ; Matsumoto and Hirata , 2016 ; Panicker et al . , 2020 ) . One day differentiated wild - type or ERM - deficient monocyte , were fluorescently labelled with two different cell trackers , mixed in a 1 : 1 ratio , and co - injected intra - arterially into recipient mice . Using real - time intravital imaging , we assessed the proportion of cells rolling along the tumor vessels and sticking to it . We revealed that the rolling and sticking fractions of ERM - tKO were similar to those of WT macrophages ( Fig 4A ) . We then demonstrated that ERM are dispensable for the interstitial infiltration of macrophages into various tissues as different as the ear dermis and tumor tissue ex vivo . To model interstitial tissue migration , we developed an ex vivo migration assay in the mouse ear dermis , in which we allowed differentially labeled WT and ERM - tKO macrophages to infiltrate for three days . To overcome the high heterogeneity of the thin ear tissue , we placed both cell types in the same tissue . Additionally , we switched the cell trackers used to stain the cells between experiments to verify the absence of effects due to staining . Tissue sections followed by immunohistochemistry demonstrated that both tKO and WT macrophages infiltrate the ear derma without any significant difference ( Fig 4B ) . Finally , we evaluated whether ERM - deficient macrophages could infiltrate tumors . As previously described ( Accarias et al . , 2020 ; Gui et al . , 2018 ) , we generated fibrosarcoma by subcutaneous injection of LPB tumor cells in mice , and the tumors were resected and sliced into thick explants of 500 µm height . A 1 : 1 mix of cell tracker - labeled WT and tKO - ERM macrophages was seeded on top of the explants , and the infiltration of the macrophages into the tumor tissue was monitored after 3 days . We found that 7 tKO - ERM macrophages infiltrated the tumor tissue in the same proportion and at the same distance than the WT macrophages ( Fig 4C ) . ERMs do not control the mechanical properties of the macrophage cortex and are dispensable for Membrane - to - Cortex Attachment ( MCA ) . Our results demonstrate that ERM proteins , which are recognized for playing crucial roles in the actin cortex ( Welf et al . , 2020 , Lembo et al . 2023 ) , are not required for macrophage migration . We therefore questioned whether ERMs are actually required for the organization of the actin cortex in macrophages by assessing the size and mechanics of these cortexes . Specifically , we used phagocytosis to internalize magnetic beads within WT and tKO - ERM macrophages , and then employed a magnetic field to align the internalized beads with those present in the extracellular environment . By pinching the cortex between the internalized and external beads , we were able to directly measure its thickness and rigidity ( Fig 5A - C ) ( Laplaud et al . , 2021 ) . Demonstrating that ERMs are dispensable for the organization of the cortex of macrophages , we did not observe any differences between ERM - tKO and WT macrophages . The thickness of the ERM - tKO cortex ( 252±29 µm ; mean±SEM ) was similar those of WT macrophages ( 284 ±29 µm ) ( Fig 5D ) , and when submitted to gradually increasing stresses , we did not measure any differences between the response of the WT ( 4544 ±662 Pa ; mean ±SEM ) and ERM - tKO macrophages ( 6574±1259 Pa ) subjected to stresses of gradually increasing intensity ( Fig 5E ) . Given the absence of structural and mechanical differences in the macrophage cortex upon ERM depletion , we also asked if the physical link between the actomyosin cortex and the plasma membrane ( Membrane - to - Cortex Attachment , MCA ) is affected . We thus performed dynamic tether pulling using atomic force spectroscopy to quantify MCA in CTL and ERM - TKO HoxB8 macrophage ( Fig 5F ) . In line with the magnetic pinching experiments , we found MCA not to be altered upon ERM depletion ( Fig 5G - H ) . Thus , ERMs seem to be dispensable in macrophages for their canonical function , which is to mechanically link the actomyosin cortex and the plasma membrane . Finally , to further investigate a functional role of ERM proteins for the dynamic mechanical properties of the macrophage cortex and its attachment to the plasma membrane , we conducted experiments on membrane blebbing . Membrane blebs play an important role in cell migration , particularly in 3D environments , and are promoted by hydrostatic pressure from the cytoplasm that causes cortical actin rupture and plasma membrane protrusions . To retract , blebs require a mechanical link between actomyosin contractions and the plasma membrane of their rim . Interestingly , in all cells studied so far , this mechanical link is strictly dependent on 8 ERM activity ( Charras et al . , 2006 ; Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2010 ; Roubinet et al . , 2011 ) . Using time - lapse microscopy to monitor bleb formation , we found that ERMs are unexpectedly dispensable for bleb dynamics in macrophages . We found no significant difference in maximum bleb size and bleb retraction rates between WT and ERM - tKO macrophages ( Fig 5I - K and movie 16 ) . Our study uncovered a surprising finding : ezrin , radixin and moesin are dispensable for key aspects of macrophage behavior , including the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia , the dynamics of membrane ruffles and podosomes , migration in vitro ( in 2D or 3D matrices ) and ex vivo ( into dermis or tumor tissues ) as well as in vivo ( for macrophage diapedesis ) . We also demonstrated that ERMs are dispensable for several cortex mechanical properties in macrophages including cortical thickness and stiffness , membrane - to - cortex attachment and control of bleb dynamics . While our wide variety of assays reveal that ERM do not play universal role in cell migration , we cannot entirely rule out that ERMs may be required under specific conditions . In any case , this study challenges the widely held belief that ERMs are universal regulators of cortical organization and cell migration ( Akisawa et al . , 1999 ; Arpin et al . , 2011 ; Crepaldi et al . , 1997 ; Louvet - Vallée , 2000 ; Valderrama et al . , 2012 ) . Instead , these findings suggest that the actin cortex of macrophages has evolved to be highly adaptable and plastic , allowing these immune cells to function independently of ERM proteins . This work paves the way for future studies aimed at deciphering the specific functioning of the macrophage cortex . 9 Methods Differentiation and culture of human primary monocyte - derived macrophages Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors by centrifugation through Ficoll - Paque Plus ( Cytiva ) , resuspended in cold phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) supplemented with 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % heat - inactivated Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS ) at pH 7 . 4 and monocytes were magnetically sorted with magnetic microbeads coupled with antibodies directed against CD14 ( Miltenyi Biotec # 130 - 050 - 201 ) . Monocytes were then seeded on glass coverslips at 1 . 5×10 6 cells / well in six - well plates in RPMI 1640 ( Gibco ) without FCS . After 2h at 37°C in a humidified 5 % CO 2 atmosphere , the medium was replaced by RPMI containing 10 % FCS and 20 ng / mL of Macrophage Colony - Stimulating Factor ( M - CSF ) ( Miltenyi 130096489 ) . For experiments , cells were harvested at day 7 using trypsin - EDTA ( Fisher Scientific ) . RNA interference knockdown CD14 + human monocytes were transfected with 200 nM siRNA using the HiPerfect system ( Qiagen ) as described previously . The mix of HiPerfect and siRNA was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then the cells were added drop by drop . The following siRNA ( Dharmacon ) were used : human ON - TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA non - targeting control pool ( siCtrl ) sequence UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA ; human ON - TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA targeting MSN ( moesin ) sequences : 5’ - CGUAUGCUGUCCAGUCUAA - 3’ ; 5’ - GAGGGAAGUUUGGUUCUUU - 3’ ; 5’ - UCGCAAGCCUGAUACCAUU - 3’ ; 5’ - GGCUGAAACUCAAUAAGAA - 3’ . After 7 days with siRNAs , macrophages were detached with trypsin - ETDA ( Invitrogen ) and lysed for western blot analysis or used for 3D collagen and Matrigel migration assays . Murine HoxB8 - progenitors culture and HoxB8 - macrophages differentiation HoxB8 progenitor cells were generated using bone marrow from C57BL / 6N Cas9 mice ( Tzelepis et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , bone - marrow cells were harvested and hematopoietic progenitor cells were purified by centrifugation using Ficoll - Paque Plus ( # 17 - 1440 - 02 ) . Then , hematopoietic cells were pre - stimulated for 2 days with complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin , 1 % glutamine , mouse IL - 3 , mouse IL - 6 and mouse SCF , each at 10 ng / mL ( Peprotech ) . Next , 2×10 5 cells were seeded on a 6 - well culture plate in myeloid medium [ complete RPMI 1640 medium , supplemented with 20 ng / mL mouse GM - CSF ( Miltenyi # 130 - 095 - 739 ) and 0 . 5 μM β - estradiol ( Sigma - Aldrich # E2758 ) ] and transduced with 1 : 5 ( vol : vol ) Thy1 . 1 - expressing ER - HoxB8 10 retrovirus supernatant using Lentiblast Premium ( OZ Biosciences ) . After one or two weeks , only ER - HoxB8 immortalized progenitors continue to proliferate . Based on the expression of Thy1 . 1 marker at the surface of the immortalized progenitors using flow cytometry , we assessed the clean transduction of the progenitor cells . HoxB8 progenitors were then passaged every 2 days in myeloid medium . To differentiate them in macrophages , progenitors were washed twice in PBS to remove estradiol from the medium , and 500 , 000 cells were plated in 6 - well - plate in complete medium containing 20 ng / mL of mM - CSF . Transfection , transduction , and sequence analysis for the creation of single and triple - knockout in murine HoxB8 progenitors SgRNAs used for knocking out ERM proteins were EZR : ( 5’ - CTACCCCGAAGACGTGGCCG - 3’ ) , RDX : ( 5’ - GCCATCCAGCCCAATACAAC - 3’ ) , and MSN : ( 5’ - TATGCCGTCCAGTCTAAGTA - 3’ ) . We targeted luciferase as a control , with LUC sgRNA : ( 5’ - GGCGCGGTCGGTAAAGTTGT - 3’ ) . For single knockouts , sgRNAs were introduced into pLenti - sgRNA backbone ( Addgene # 71409 ) with BsmBI digestion ( New Englands Biolabs # R0739 ) and T4 DNA ligase ( Fischer Scientific EL011L ) . For the triple ERM - knockout , all three sgRNAs were cloned on a same plasmid by golden gate assembly ( Kabadi et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , phU6 - gRNA ( # 53188 ) intermediary plasmid was used to clone EZR gRNA , pmU6 - gRNA ( # 53187 ) to clone RDX and LUC gRNAs , # 53189 ph7SK - gRNA for MSN , and a mock ( 5’ - TTTTTTTTTT - 3’ ) sequence was cloned into # 53186 phH1 - gRNA , and the three plasmids previously mentioned . All intermediary plasmids containing respective sgRNA were then cloned into the final pLV hUbC - Cas9 - T2A - GFP plasmid ( Addgene # 53190 ) , where GFP was replaced by puromycin resistance . Then , HoxB8 progenitors were knocked - out for ezrin , radixin or moesin using CRISPR Cas9 . Briefly , HEK293T cells were co - transfected with pMDL ( Addgene # 12251 ) , pREV ( Addgene # 12253 ) , pVSV - G ( Addgene # 12259 ) and specific sgRNA - cloned plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 and OptiMEM according to manufacturer’s guidelines to generate lentiviral particles for transduction into Cas9 - expressing HoxB8 progenitors . Then , 2×10 5 HoxB8 progenitors were transduced with viral particles and Lentiblast Premium ( OZ Biosciences ) . After 24h , transduced cells were selected with 10 µg / mL of puromycin ( Invivogen ) for 2 days and validated by immunoblotting . For the triple ERM - KO only , a clonal amplification was performed by single cell sorting and clones were screened for ezrin , radixin and moesin absence of expression by flow cytometry . Immunoblotting with respective ERM antibodies confirmed the depletion of the three ERM proteins in three independent clones ( tKO # 1 , tKO # 2 , tKO # 3 ) . Additionally , total genomic DNA of clonal populations was extracted using TRIzol Reagent ( ThermoFisher ) . Genomic sites encompassing targeted guide regions were amplified 11 by PCR using GoTaq polymerase ( Promega ) and sequenced , in order to analyze the genomic point mutations acquired by each clone on the three E , R , M genes . Western blot The following rabbit antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling : anti - ezrin ( # 3145S , 1 / 1000 ) , anti - moesin ( # 3150 , 1 / 1000 ) , anti - radixin ( # 2636S , 1 / 1000 ) , anti - pan - ERM ( # 3142P , WB 1 / 1000 ) . Rabbit anti - phospho - ERM ( 1 / 5000 ) ( Roubinet et al . , 2011 ) and rabbit anti - actin ( Sigma - Aldrich A5060 , 1 / 10 , 000 ) were also used . Cells were lysed by addition of boiling 2X Laemmli buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors ( 5 mM sodium orthovanadate , 20 mM sodium fluoride and 25mM β - glycerophosphate ) . Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in 8 % SDS – PAGE gels , and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane . Membranes were saturated with 3 % BSA in TBS - T ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 2 ; 150 mM NaCl ; and 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) for 30 min , and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C . Then , primary antibodies were revealed using HRP - coupled secondary anti - mouse ( Sigma ) or anti - rabbit antibodies ( Cell Signaling ) for 1 h . Finally , HRP activity was revealed using an electrochemiluminescence kit ( Amersham ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . All quantifications were normalized against actin expression . In vitro migration assays 2D random migration 2 - 6×10 3 HoxB8 - macrophages were harvested and plated on glass - based 96 - wells within complete medium . 2D random migration was recorded every 3 min for 16h with the 10X objective of a wide - field EVOS M7000 ( Invitrogen ) in an environmental chamber maintaining the temperature at 37°C and 5 % CO2 . After cell segmentation , tracking of macrophages was done using the automated Trackmate plugin of ImageJ with the LogDetector and Simple LAP tracker . Only the tracks lasting more than 1 hour were kept for the analysis . In addition to the median speed , the confinement ratio was defined as the ratio of the net distance on the total distance traveled by the cell . 2D chemotaxis toward complement 5a ( C5a ) 25 , 000 hoxB8 - macrophages were seeded in the center part of a μ chemotaxis slide ( Ibidi ) and let to adhere at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for 10 min . The peripheral chambers were filled with 65 µL of complete medium containing 20 ng / mL murine M - CSF . A C5a gradient ( R & D systems # 2150C5025 ) was then generated by adding 30 µL of medium containing 60 nM murine recombinant C5a protein to the left part of the slide . Cells were imaged as in the 2D random 12 assay every 3 min for 16h . The FastTrackAI artificial Intelligence performed cell tracking , and tracks were filtered using the Chemotaxis and Migration tool ( Ibidi , free download from http : / / www . ibidi . de / applications / ap _ chemo . html ) . 3D transwell migration in Matrigel and collagen I For 3D migration assays , 24 - transwells ( 8 - μm pores ) were loaded with either 100 μl of 10 mg / mL Matrigel TM ( Corning ) or 110 μl of 2 . 15 mg / mL fibrillar collagen I ( Nutragen ) , mixed with MEM 10× , H2O , and buffered with bicarbonate solution ( Van Goethem et al . , 2010 ) . Matrices were allowed to polymerize for 30 min at 37°C , and rehydrated overnight with RPMI 1640 without FCS . The lower chamber was then filled with RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS and 20 ng / mL mouse M - CSF , and the upper chamber with RPMI 1640 containing 2 % FCS and 20 ng / mL mouse M - CSF . 5×10 4 macrophages were serum starved for 3 h and seeded in the upper chamber . Each experiment was performed in triplicate . After 24h , 48h or 72h of migration , z - series of images were acquired at the surface and inside of the matrices with 30 μm intervals . Acquisition and quantification of cell migration was performed using the motorized stage of an inverted video microscope ( Leica DMIRB , Leica Microsystems , Deerfield , IL ) and the cell counter plugin of the ImageJ software as described previously ( Van Goethem et al . , 2010 ) . The percentage of migration was obtained after counting the number of cells within the matrix and dividing by the total number of cells . The distribution of the cells into the matrix is represented by plotting the migration distance of each cell . Ex vivo infiltration of mouse macrophages in tumor and ear derma tissue explants Ethics : All experiments on animals were performed according to animal protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Pharmacology and Structural Biology ( APAFIS No . 201609161058531 ) . Preparation of tumor explants : 1×10 6 LPB fibrosarcoma cell were injected subcutaneously in the flank of C57BL / 6 mice to induce a fibrosarcoma ( Gui et al . , 2018 ) . 1 cm 3 tumors were resected and embedded in 3 % low gelling agarose ( Sigma - Aldrich # A701 ) prepared in PBS . 500 µm - thick slices were obtained with the Krumdieck tissue slicer ( TSE Systems ) filled with ice - cold PBS ( Life Technologies ) ( Gui et al . , 2018 ) . Preparation of ear derma tissue : 13 Depilated ears from sacrificed C57BL / 6 mice were resected . Ear halves were separated under stereomicroscope ( Leica microsystems ) lengthwise to expose ear derma . Ex vivo infiltration assays of mouse macrophages in tissue explants : Tumor slice and ear derma explants were then cultured on a 30 - mm cell culture insert featuring a hydrophilic PTFE membrane ( 0 . 4 µm pore size , Merck Millipore # PICM0RG50 ) placed inside 6 - well plates containing 1 . 1 mL of RPMI . A 4 mm diameter stainless - steel washer was then placed on top of each tissue slice to create a well for macrophages seeding . The same day , HoxB8 - macrophages CTL and TKO - ERM were differentially labeled with 5 µM Green CellTracker CMFDA ( Invitrogen # C7025 ) , or Red CellTracker CMPTX ( Invitrogen # C34552 ) for 30 min at 37°C . Macrophages were harvested and a 1 : 1 mix of CTL and TKO - ERM macrophages was seeded ( 1 , 5×10 4 cells / mm² ) on top of tissue explants and incubated in a 37°C , 5 % CO2 environment for 72 hours . After 16 hours of coculture , the washer was removed . Culture medium ( RPMI 1640 , Gibco ) was replaced daily for 3 days before overnight paraformaldehyde 4 % ( EMS # 15714 ) tissue fixation at 4°C and embedded in paraffin . The green and red cell trackers were exchanged between experiments in order to verify the absence of effect due to staining . 5 µm - thick ear or tumor paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) or immunostained by immunohistofluorescence . To limit tissue autofluorescence , CMFDA staining of HoxB8 infiltrate in tissue , was stained by anti - fluorescein ( 1 : 100 , Invitrogen # A889 ) by overnight incubation at 4°C . The sections were incubated at room temperature with goat anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 ( 1 : 200 , Invitrogen # A21246 ) for 2 hours and nuclei were visualized with DAPI ( Sigma D9542 ) . The CMPTX cell tracker fluorescence was directly acquired . All images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 using a X20 / 0 . 8 Plan Apochromat objective ( Zeiss ) . Images were acquired with an ORCA - flash 4 . 0 LT ( Hamamatsu ) camera and processed using Zen software ( Zeiss ) . For each image , the percentage of infiltrated HoxB8 WT or TKO macrophages , calculated with a threshold of 10 µm under the tissue surface , was compared to the total number of macrophages infiltrated in the tissue . Quantifications were done using ImageJ ‘ Threshold and Analyze particles’ tool to select CMFDA or CMPTX positive cells , and the measure of migration distance was enabled using the ‘ Segmented line’ and the ‘ Straighten ’ tools to linearize tissue surface . For ear tissue infiltration , we performed the analysis on 4 ears halves from 4 mice , taking 1 - 4 sections per ears halves . For analysis of macrophage tumor infiltration , we used 6 ex vivo 500µm - slices from 3 tumors , taking 7 - 9 sections per ex vivo slices . In vivo diapedesis with wide - field intravital microscopy 14 C57Bl6Jj female mice were subcutaneous injected 100 µL PBS with 5×10 5 MCA Prog ( 9609 ) fibrosarcoma tumor cell to induce a fast - growing fibrosarcoma ( O’Sullivan et al . , 2012 ) . Intravital microscopy was performed at day 8 to 10 before the tumor reach 1 cm 3 . For in vivo diapedesis , HoxB8 - progenitors were differentiated only for 1 day with 20 ng / mL m - M - CSF . CTL and TKO - ERM so - called HoxB8 - monocytes were harvested and differentially labeled with 10 µM Green CellTracker CMFDA ( Invitrogen # C7025 ) and 10 µM Red CellTracker CMPTX ( Invitrogen # C34552 ) for 20 min . Green and red cell trackers were exchanged between experiments . A 1 : 1 mix of CTL : TKO - ERM cells was resuspended in physiological serum . Recipient mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg / mL xylazine and 5 mg / mL ketamine per kg / mouse , and placed on a customized stage for securing animals and immobilizing the subcutaneous tumor . A heating pad with temperature feedback to an mTCII micro Temperature Controller ( Cell MicroControls , Norflok , VA , USA ) was used to maintain the temperature of animals . The right femoral artery was catheterized for retrograde injection of labeled cells , and tumor was exposed for intravital microscopy as previously described ( Moussion and Girard , 2011 ; von Andrian , 1996 ) . Recipient mice were then transferred to a customized intravital video microscopy setup ( DM6 - FS , Leica Microsystems SAS , Nanterre , France ) equipped with water immersion objectives ( HCX APO ; Leica Microsystems ) and an image splitting optics W - VIEW GEMINI ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Massy , France ) allowing simultaneous image acquisition of dual wavelength images ( 512 / 25 and 630 / 92nm for green and red cell tracker respectively ) onto a single camera . Two color fluorescent events in the microcirculation of tumor / draining lymph node were visualized and recorded at 33 frames / seconde by an OrcaFlash LT4 . 0 + camera and the HCImage software ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) at multiple positions of the tumor . After combination of green and red images on a single image , rolling fractions , i . e . , the percentage of rolling cells in the total flux of cells in each blood vessel ; and sticking fractions , i . e . , the percentage of rolling cells that firmly adhered for a minimum of 30 seconds , were calculated for all blood vessels imaged in tumor . Immunofluorescence and cell morphological analysis For analysis of the morphology of TKO - ERM macrophages , HoxB8 - macrophages CTL and TKO - ERM were differentially labeled with 10 µM Blue CellTracker CMAC ( Invitrogen # C2110 ) or 10 µM Red CellTracker CMPTX ( Invitrogen # C34552 ) for 30min . Blue and red cell trackers were exchanged between independent experiments . Macrophages were harvested and a 1 : 1 mix of CTL and TKO - ERM macrophages were plated on glass coverslips for 1 h . They were fixed for 10 min in 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde solution containing 15 mM sucrose in Phosphate Buffer Saline ( PBS ) ( Fisher Scientific ) at room temperature . After fixation , cells were 15 permeabilized for 10 min with PBS / 0 . 3 % Triton and blocked with PBS / 0 . 3 % Triton / 1 % BSA . Samples were incubated with green AlexaFluor 488 - conjugated phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) for 30min , then washed and mounted . Mosaic images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 using a X100 / 1 , 4 Plan Apochromat objective ( Zeiss ) . Cells were semi - automatically segmented to measure their area and circularity based on their actin staining . WT and TKO ERM cells were differentiated based on their respective cell tracker , which were inversed between experiments to ensure they do not have an effect . Then , podosomes were detected using the ' Find Maxima ' function of the ImageJ software . Filopodia of 30 cells for each condition were manually traced to get their length and number per cell . Live structural illumination microscopy ( SIM ) imaging of ezrin , radixin , and moesin transfected in human macrophages For live imaging of ERM proteins shown in Movies 1 - 6 , primary human macrophages were detached using trypsin - EDTA and transfected with Lifeact - mCherry and either ezrin - GFP , radixin - GFP or moesin - GFP plasmids 4h before observation using a Neon® MP5000 electroporation system ( Invitrogen ) with the following parameters : two 1000V , 40 ms pulses , with 0 . 5 μg DNA each for 2×10 5 cells . Ezrin - GFP from Leguay et al . , 2021 , Radixin - GFP and Moesin – GFP were obtained by subcloning PCR amplified Ezrin , Radixin and Moesin , respectively , into pEGFP - N1 vector ( Clontech ) . All PCRs were performed using Phusion High - Fidelity DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . SIM live images of double - transfected cells were acquired every 15 s using a Plan - Apochromat 63x / 1 . 4 Oil DIC M27 on an Elyra 7 microscope ( Zeiss ) and 129 nm - interspaced Z - stacks were also acquired . Super - resolution reconstruction was done with Zen Black ( 3 . 0 SR ) SIM algorithm 3D leap processing with autosharpess . Chromatic aberrations were corrected with a channel alignment calculated from a multicolor subresolutive beads acquisition from the same half - day . Scanning Electron microscopy HoxB8 progenitors and macrophages were fixed using 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) glutaraldehyde . After post - fixation in 1 % osmium tetraoxide ( in 0 . 2 mol / L cacodylate buffer ) , cells were dehydrated in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations and critical point dried using carbon dioxide . After coating with gold , cells were examined with a JEOL JSM - 6700F scanning electron microscope . For image analysis , protrusions of each HoxB8 - progenitor cells present in a square of 4µm 2 were manually counted . Lamellipodia of HoxB8 - macrophages were manually detoured and expressed as a percentage of the cell perimeter . 16 Live random illumination microscopy of actin structures For live imaging of the actin remodeling in 2D and 3D matrices , shown in Movies 7 , 14 and 15 , HoxB8 - WT and ERM - TKO ( tKO # 1 ) progenitors were stably transduced with Lifeact - GFP plasmid - containing virus . Cells were sorted by flow cytometry according to their GFP expression . Subsequent differentiated macrophages were detached using PBS - EDTA and plated on Ibidi wells ( 8 wells Ibidi # 80826 ) , either directly in 2D bare glass , or mixed with 100 % Matrigel , or 2 , 15 mg / mL collagen I at 2×10 6 cells per mL , and allowed to polymerize for 30 min in the incubator before adding complete medium . Random Illumination Microscopy was then performed using a home - made system ( Mangeat et al . , 2021 ) . Images were acquired every 10 s for 5 min using an inverted microscope ( TEi Nikon ) equipped with a 100x magnification , 1 . 49 N . A . objective ( CFI SR APO 100XH ON 1 . 49 NIKON ) and an sCMOS camera ( ORCA - Flash4 . 0 LT , Hamamatsu ) . Fast diode lasers ( Oxxius ) with respective wavelengths 488 nm ( LBX - 488 - 200 - CSB ) and 561 nm ( LMX - 561L - 200 - COL ) were collimated using a fiber collimator ( RGBV Fiber Collimators 60FC Sukhamburg ) to produce TEM00 2 . 2 mm - diameter beam . The polarization beam was rotated with an angle of 5 degrees before hitting a X4 Beam Expander beam ( GBE04 - A ) and produced a 8 . 8 mm TEM00 beam . A fast spatial light phase binary modulator ( QXGA fourth dimensions ) was conjugated to the image plane to create speckle random illumination . Image reconstruction was then performed as detailed in ( Mangeat et al . , 2021 ) and at https : / / github . com / teamRIM / tutoRIM . Analysis of podosome maintenance in 2D was performed using ImageJ . Briefly , we quantified the number of podosomes appearing , maintained , or disappearing between 4 images at 1 - minute intervals ( Fig S3 ) . Analysis of ruffle retraction in 3D collagen I was performed as follow . The ruffle dynamics were analyzed in videos of 300 s with a 10 s frequency : using ImageJ , we measured the length of the protrusion at its maximal elongation , and the time until the protrusion disappeared . Measure of cortex thickness and dynamics Beads preparation Superparamegnetic microbeads M - 450 ( Dynabeads ) were prepared in two solutions . For both , 60 µL of stock solution was washed three times with PBS using a magnet to retain the beads in the pellet between each rinsing . They were then re - suspended in 200 µL of complete medium ( DMEM + 10 % FBS ) for the bead solution n°1 , and in 200 µL of 0 . 5 mg / mL PLL - g - PEG ( Peg 2 kDa , SuSos ) in HEPES for the bead solution n°2 . Both were placed on a wheel for 8h to get coated by their respective medium . In the following methods , beads from the first solution were incubated with cells to be ingested , while those from the second solution were 17 intended to be less likely intaken . Magnetic setup As described in ( Laplaud et al . , 2021 ) , an Axio A1 inverted microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) is used as the base for the Magnetic Pincher setup . Imaged are produced using an oil - immersion 100× objective [ 1 . 4 numerical aperture ] mounted on a piezo - controlled translator ( Physik Instrumente ) and recorded with an Orca Flash4 camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Two coaxial coils ( SBEA ) with mu metal core ( length , 40 mm ; diameter , 26 to 88 mm ; 750 spires ) are placed in Helmoltz configuration in a way to generate a quasi - homogeneous magnetic field in the sample region . They are powered by a bipolar operational power supply amplifier 6A / 36V ( Kepco ) controlled by a data acquisition module ( National Instruments ) . The maximum field generated is 54mT with a gradient less than 0 . 1 mT·mm −1 over the sample . During an experiment , the self - organization of beads is first triggered with a constant field of 5mT before acquisition of time - lapse images . The sample is maintained at 37°C using the Box and the Cube from Life Imaging Systems . The setup is controlled via a data acquisition module by a custom LabVIEW interface that ensures the synchronicity between piezo position , magnetic field imposition , and image acquisition . Pinching experiment CTL and ERM - TKO HoxB8 macrophages were plated on glass in Petri dishes and in each of them 1 µL of the bead solution n°1 was added ( 1 , 5×10 5 beads ) and incubated for 30min so that the cells would take up the beads . Then 2 µL of bead solution n°2 was added and the medium was supplemented with 20 mM HEPES buffer , to maintain the pH of the medium during the experiment without CO 2 control . For each dish , cells with their cortex pinched between beads were imaged with the previously described magnetic setup . In each film acquisition , the nominal magnetic field exerted by the coils was 5 mT ( 100pN ) , every 10s the field was lowered to 1 mT ( 31 pN ) , then increased to 54 mT ( 1150 pN ) in 1 . 5 s , and then brought back to 5 mT ( values between brackets are the corresponding typical force values ) . This series of compression - relaxation was repeated 6 to 10 times per cell , and an epifluorescence image of the LifeAct - GFP signal was taken between each cycle . In addition to the images , the precise time and magnetic field corresponding to each image was recorded . Data analysis Using Fiji’s plugin “Analyze Particle” , the center of all beads on each image of time - lapse was detected with a subpixel resolution ( Laplaud et al . , 2021 ) . Using a home - made tracking 18 algorithm written in Python ( https : / / github . com / jvermeil - biophys / CortExplore _ PublicVersion ) the trajectories in 3D of the centers of the two beads pinching the cortex were detected , and the thickness of the pinched cortex was computed . The pinching force was also computed knowing the distance between the beads , the external magnetic field and the magnetization function of the beads . This analysis was complemented by a visual inspection of the LifeAct - GFP images of the cells and compressions occurring while a phagocytosis process had begun were removed from the dataset . To characterize the cortex thickness , the metric we chose is the median of the cortical thickness at 5 mT ( nominal field ) , which corresponds to a typical force of 100 + / - 18 pN . To compute the elastic modulus at low stress , we computed the strain - stress curve corresponding to each compression using a model developed by R . S . Chadwick for this specific geometry ( Chadwick , 2002 ) . Then we fitted the slope of these strain - stress curves between 150 and 350Pa . Atomic force spectroscopy CTL and ERM - TKO HoxB8 macrophages were plated into a 35mm Fluorodish ( WPI ) 24h before the experiment . 30min prior to the AFM experiment , the serum concentration in the medium was reduced to 2 % FBS . qp - SCONT cantilevers ( Nanosensors ) were mounted on a CellHesion 200 AFM ( Bruker ) , connected into an Eclipse Ti inverted light microscope ( Nikon ) . Cantilevers were calibrated using the contact - based approach , followed by coating with 4 mg / ml Concanavalin A ( Sigma ) for 1 hour at 37°C . Cantilevers were washed with 1x PBS before the measurements . MCA ( Membrane - to - Cortex Attachment ) was estimated using dynamic tether pulling as follows : Approach velocity was set to 0 . 5 µm / s , with a contact force of 200 pN , and contact time was varied between 100 ms to 10 s , aiming at maximizing the probability to extrude single tethers . The cantilever was then retracted for 80 µm at a velocity of 2 , 5 , 10 or 30 µm / s . Tether force at the moment of tether breakage was recorded at a sampling rate of 2000 Hz . Resulting force curves were analyzed using the JPK Data Processing Software and the resulting force - velocity data was fitted to the Brochard - Wyart model ( Brochard - Wyart et al . , 2006 ) to allow estimation of an MCA parameter Alpha , that is proportional to the density of binders ( i . e . the active MCA molecules ) and the emerging effective viscosity . Measurements were run at 37 C with 5 % CO2 and samples were used no longer than 1 h for data acquisition . More details on the method can be found in ( Bergert and Diz - Muñoz , 2023 ) . Statistical analysis 19 Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 9 . 0 ( GraphPad Software Inc . ) . For western blot quantifications , the expression of each protein in human or HoxB8 macrophages was compared to monocytes or Hox progenitors , two by two , respectively , using a ratio paired two - tailed t - test . For all migration experiments including 3D migration percentage , distance , and the velocity , directionality , FMIx and confinement ratio of 2D migrations ; the means of each 3 independent experiments was compared to WT condition using either paired t - test for comparison of 2 conditions , or RM Anova one - way for more than 2 conditions . For morphological experiments based on SEM , and actin immunofluorescence analysis , data were compared between TKO cells and control cells using the two - tailed Mann - Whitney test . In all cases * correspond to p < 0 . 05 .
