1318 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 11 NOVEMBER 2010 nature structural & molecular biology a r t i c l e s Actin was discovered more than 60 years ago 1 and has been extensively studied because of its crucial roles in many functions , such as cell shape and polarity 2 and force generation in muscle 3 . Under physio­ logical salt concentrations , monomeric ( globular ) actin , known as G­actin , polymerizes to form filamentous actin ( F­actin ) , a helical filament . Actin is one of the most abundant eukaryotic proteins , and its activities in vivo are modulated by > 150 different actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) 4 . These ABPs control actin polymerization in the cell as well as filament assembly into higher­order structures . Because the active form of actin is the filament , a significant effort has been made to obtain a high­resolution structure of F­actin . The actin filament is not easily analyzed by crystallography . Actin subunits have been impaired for polymerization by chemical modifications , mutations , or actin­binding proteins and drugs 5 – 7 , and some of the resulting crystal structures have been used to build atomic models of the actin filament by fitting X­ray fiber diffraction patterns from oriented F­actin gels 8 – 11 . A recent study using this approach clarified the con­ formational transition from G­ to F­actin 11 : a ‘flattening’ of the actin subunit by a relative rotation of the two major domains . An extensive literature suggests , however , that F­actin cannot be described by a single structural model . F­actin is known to have a variable twist 12 and a variable tilt of subunits 13 , which suggest a multiplicity of subunit­subunit interactions 14 . Several key structural elements of actin , such as the DNase I binding loop 15 ( D loop ) , the hydrophobic plug 16 and the N terminus 17 , 18 , are highly mobile . A single model for F­actin does not seem to explain the cross­linking of residues within the filament 19 , and these results suggest a large degree of plasticity and heterogeneity within F­actin . A notable feature of actin is its anomalously low rate of sequence divergence over evolution 20 . There are no amino acid changes between chicken and human striated skeletal muscle actins 21 , and human cytoplasmic actin is 87 % identical to yeast actin . In contrast , the bacterial actin homologs identified to date have no such sequence conservation among themselves or with eukaryotic actin 22 . There are a number of possible explanations for this unusual conservation of eukaryotic actin . One is that actin’s interaction with more than 150 ABPs in the cell constrains many residues and imposes a strong selective force 4 . An analysis of the residues in actin that have diverged 23 shows that they are mainly on the surface of the filament where they would interact with actin­binding proteins , suggesting that the divergence of ABPs can explain the divergence of some surface residues in actin but not the conservation of most buried residues . Because actin requires a specific chaperonin to fold , the interactions with the chaperonin may have placed many constraints on sequence divergence 24 . Highly expressed proteins evolve slowly 25 , presumably as a means to prevent protein misfolding , and actin is one of the most highly expressed proteins . A different explanation for the anomalous sequence conservation relates to the multiplicity of F­actin structural states 13 . In this argu­ ment , the multiplicity of functions , interactions and higher­order structures requires actin to adopt different conformations , and this multiplicity of structural states puts a pressure on most amino acids within the actin molecule . Allosteric interactions exist within actin 26 , 27 , and allosteric networks must create selection on buried residues that link the distant sites 28 . F­actin is likely to undergo con­ formational changes during muscle contraction that are essential for force generation by myosin 29 . Actin can be changed by mutations 29 , chemical modifications 30 , 31 or proteolysis 32 , leaving myosin’s bind­ ing and actin’s activation of myosin’s ATPase unaffected , but greatly reducing or eliminating force generation . To understand the intrinsic structural polymorphism of F­actin , we used electron microscopy of unmodified frozen­hydrated actin filaments and single­particle approaches to sort heterogeneous seg­ ments into more homogeneous classes . Many other structural studies of F­actin have used stabilization of the filaments by phalloidin , a heptapeptide that is tightly bound and likely to change the 1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia , USA . 2 Institute of Structural Biology and Biophysics , Forschungszentrum Jülich , Jülich , Germany .

The desire to explain phenomena from muscle contraction to cytokinesis in mechanistic detail has driven the generation of an atomic model of the actin filament ( F - actin ) . Here we use electron cryomicroscopy to show that frozen - hydrated actin filaments contain a multiplicity of different structural states . We show ( at ~ 10 Å resolution ) that subdomain 2 can be disordered and can make multiple contacts with the C terminus of a subunit above it . We link a number of disease - causing mutations in the human ACTA1 gene to the most structurally dynamic elements of actin . Because F - actin is structurally polymorphic , it cannot be described using only one atomic model and must be understood as an ensemble of different states . © 2010 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

The advances that we describe result from improved resolution as well as improved means of separating heterogene­ ous structures into classes . We suggest that the number of mutations in the human ACTA1 gene that cause disease is related to the structural dynamics of the actin filament . RESULTS Frozen - hydrated actin filaments have structural heterogeneity Electron cryomicrographs of F­actin were recorded using standard methods ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Short segments ( containing ~ 17 actin subunits ) were treated as single particles , and the iterative helical real­space reconstruction ( IHRSR ) method that does not require averaging over long filament lengths 33 was used . There is no relation­ ship between the length of the segments that we used ( ~ 17 subunits ) and the length of the pseudorepeat of an actin filament ( ~ 13 subunits ) , as the single­particle approach to helical reconstruction only requires that the segments contain multiple subunits . The 63 , 288 segments were divided into six classes based on a multireference approach . A tilted state of the subunit , called T­mode ( Fig . 1a ) , accounted for 24 % of all segments . The cryo­EM reconstruction of T­mode is consistent with our earlier observations from negatively stained F­actin 13 indicating that in this mode , SD2 of the lower protomer makes an extensive contact with SD3 of the protomer above it ( Fig . 1a , cyan arrow ) , whereas the interaction of SD4 of the lower protomer with SD3 of the upper actin subunit weakens compared to that of ‘canonical’ F­actin ( Fig . 1a , green arrow ) . In the tilted state , the nucleotide­binding cleft is open ( Fig . 1a , red asterisk ) because of the rotation around the hinge region of the two domains of actin by ~ 30° , accompanied by a shift apart of these domains by ~ 10 Å . The top and the side helix of SD4 in the tilted reconstruction ( filtered to 16 Å ) ( Fig . 1a , blue and red arrows , respectively ) stick out of the map suggesting structural variability of SD4 . In contrast , SD1 yields an excellent fit at this resolution . The small number of segments in this class ( n = 15 , 218 ) prevented us from carrying out further refinement of the structural details of the tilted state . The remaining segments ( n = 48 , 070 ) were sorted according to the structural state of SD2 . X­ray crystallography has shown that the D loop , located at the top of SD2 , can fold into a β ­strand 5 or an α ­helix 6 or be disordered 34 . We designed model volumes based upon crys­ tal structures and prior knowledge at lower resolution , which we then used in a cross­correlation analysis ( see Online Methods , Supplementary Figs . 1 – 4 and Supplementary Video ) . We found five additional structural modes of F­actin ( modes 1 – 5 ) , and the corre­ sponding three­dimensional reconstructions are shown in Figure 1 . In contrast to the tilted state , the resolution of the reconstructions for modes 1 – 4 was determined to be ~ 10 Å ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In mode 5 the entire density for SD2 is missing , and the overall reso­ lution is poorer ( ~ 14 Å , Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . The resolution is sufficient to resolve the D loop in modes 1 – 3 . In mode 1 the density of the D­loop portion of the map is most consistent with being in a loop conformation ( Fig . 1a , b , blue ribbons ) , whereas in mode 2 the density is more compact and is fit better by a helix ( Fig . 1a , b , cyan ribbons ) . This region has been observed as a helix in one crystal 6 . The fit as a helix is constrained by both the width and length of the density , given the need to fit the known protein chain . When the density is both thinner and longer , the region is modeled as a loop . An α ­helix cannot be extended to fit the longer density without the helix melt­ ing . In mode 3 the D loop is also helical ( Fig . 1 , mode 3 , red ribbons ) but is rotated toward the exterior of the filament by ~ 18° ( Fig . 1c ) . In the fourth mode ( Fig . 1a , mode 4 , green ribbons ) , the D loop is disordered ( Fig . 1a , mode 4 , magenta arrowhead ) . Mode 5 ( Fig . 1a , mode 5 , yellow ribbons ) is marked by the absence of density cor­ responding to SD2 , showing that it must be substantially disordered ( Fig . 1a , mode 5 , magenta arrow ) . At ~ 10 Å resolution the overall reconstruction yields an excellent match with the recently proposed atomic model of the actin fila­ ment 11 , except that the N terminus of actin is not visualized in our global averaged map ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The interface between the SD3 and SD4 is conserved The atomic models of modes 1 – 4 of F­actin have similar SD3 and SD4 conformations but are very different in the SD2 portion ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . This similarity results in a conserved interprotomer SD4­SD3 interface ( both lateral and longitudinal ) in these four modes . Because the resolution of the fifth mode is significantly worse than that of the other modes , it is hard to con­ clude whether this SD4 – SD3 interface is different in mode 5 . In addition to the longitudinal contact ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) , all modes possess two lateral contacts between the two actin strands ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . One lateral contact is formed by residues 110 – 115 and residues 191 – 199 from the two neighboring actin protomers across the strand ( Supplementary Fig . 5d , blue and yellow ribbons ) . The other lateral contact is formed by the hydro­ phobic plug ( Supplementary Fig . 5d , residues 263 – 273 , in cyan ) forming a contact with residues 171 – 173 and 285 – 286 of the actin protomer above it on the opposite strand ( Supplementary Fig . 5d , red and black ribbons , respectively ) and residues 201 – 203 of the T - mode a b c Mode 1 z z Mode 2 90 ° 90 ° ~ 18 ° Mode 3 Mode 4 Mode 5 Figure 1 Six structural modes of actin found in frozen - hydrated actin filaments .

Our data are thus in complete agreement with the proposed 11 SD3 – SD4 lateral and longitudinal interactions . In mode 5 SD2 is completely disordered ( Fig . 1 , mode 5 , magenta arrow ) , and the filament is only held together by the interactions between SD3 and SD4 described above . This is consistent with the fact that A204E / P243K actin , with just two point mutations at the longitudinal interface between SD3 and SD4 , is non­polymerizable 7 . We suggest that the ability of the SD3 – SD4 interface to hold the fila­ ment together allows SD2 of actin to adopt multiple conformations without disrupting the filament . The D loop of actin is highly polymorphic In modes 1 – 3 ( Fig . 1a ) , we have visualized the entire density expected for SD2 , but this density shows a multiplicity of conformations and interactions with SD1 of the subunit above within the same strand ( Fig . 2 ) . In mode 1 , the D­loop region forms an extended thin ridge of density that is consistent with a loop ( Fig . 2b , red ribbons ) . Because of the extended state , the D loop is able to make two bridges of density ( Fig . 2b , cyan and green arrowheads ) with the subunit above , namely with residues 350 – 352 ( Fig . 2b , magenta ribbons ) and 374 – 375 ( Fig . 2b , black ribbons ) in the C­terminal region . In modes 2 and 3 the den­ sity is more consistent with the D loop being a helix ( Fig . 2c , d , red ribbons ) . As the D­loop region is more compact in modes 2 and 3 , it makes only a single interaction , compared with the two interactions observed in mode 1 . In mode 2 this interaction is with the C­terminal residues 374 – 375 of the protomer above ( Fig . 2c , green arrowhead ) . In mode 3 the D loop is shifted toward the exterior of the filament ( Fig . 1c ) and makes a prominent contact with the 350 – 352 region of the subunit above ( Fig . 2d , cyan arrowhead ) . The observed multiplicity of interactions between SD1 and SD2 is consistent with biochemical observations . A cysteine replacing Gln41 can form a disulfide bond with Cys374 of an adjacent actin protomer 16 . In the recent atomic model of the actin filament 11 the distance between the C α atoms of these two residues is 13 . 4 Å , which suggests that either the two regions of actin must be shifted from the proposed positions to be able to form a disulfide , or one or both of these residues must fluctuate between multiple positions . In our mode 2 ( Fig . 2c , red and black spheres ) , the distance between these two resi­ dues is 9 . 7 Å , which brings the two residues close enough to form a disulfide bond . The ionic bridge between residues 39 and 167 of two neighboring actin protomers is crucial for yeast survival 35 . In the latest F­actin model 11 , these two residues are 11 . 7 Å apart . The posi­ tion of the D loop in mode 3 ( Fig . 2d ) brings the C α atoms from these residues 6 . 3 Å apart , which makes an ionic interaction possible . In mode 4 the D loop is completely missing in the EM map as a result of disorder or multiple states ( Fig . 2e ) . In this mode the C­terminal portion of the upper protomer does not make any contacts with the lower protomer , and the hydrophobic pocket at the base of SD1 and SD3 is open for interactions with ABPs that bind to this site 36 . The D - loop conformation is coupled to other parts of actin We suggest that the D loop controls the connectivity between the strands . Two parts of the actin filament , the interstrand contact involv­ ing the hydrophobic plug and the N terminus of actin , both undergo significant structural alterations coupled with the conformation of the D loop ( Fig . 3 ) . Two regions of SD2 contribute to the interstrand interaction with the hydrophobic plug ( Fig . 3a , magenta ribbons ) : residues 64 – 67 ( Fig . 3a , blue ribbons ) and residues 38 – 40 ( Fig . 3a , red ribbons ) . In modes 1 and 2 , both regions are at the interface with a b c e d Figure 2 D loop of the lower subunit makes polymorphic interactions with the upper protomer . ( a ) To display details of interaction of the D loop with the C - terminal portion of the upper protomer , the reconstruction is tilted out of plane by 40° . The region of F - actin magnified in b – e is marked with a black rectangle . ( b ) In mode 1 the D loop ( red ribbons ) of the lower protomer makes two contacts with the C terminus of the upper subunit ( cyan and green arrowheads ) , and these are with residues 350 – 352 ( magenta ) and 374 – 375 ( black ) . ( c ) In mode 2 the D loop is in the helical conformation and is capable of making only one interaction with residues 374 – 375 ( black ) of the C terminus of the upper protomer ( green arrowhead ) . In this mode residue 41 ( red spheres ) is near residue 374 ( black spheres ) . ( d ) In mode 3 the D loop is positioned near the exterior of the filament and makes a bridge of density ( cyan arrowhead ) only with the 350 – 352 portion ( magenta ) of the upper subunit . ( e ) In mode 4 the D loop is disordered and does not make any interactions with the C terminus of the upper protomer . Mode 1 a b c Mode 2 Mode 3 Mode 4 Figure 3 D loop may work as an allosteric switch . ( a ) The two regions of SD2 that are adjacent to the lateral contact ( cyan arrows ) formed by the hydrophobic plug ( 263 – 273 magenta ribbons ) are 64 – 67 ( blue ribbons ) and 38 – 40 ( red ribbons ) . In mode 1 and mode 2 , these two SD2 regions are positioned similarly , whereas in mode 3 they are moved away from the hydrophobic plug , which results in the weakening of the lateral contact ( compare the lateral bridges of density marked with cyan arrows ) . In mode 4 the top of SD2 that includes the 38 – 40 region is missing , but residues 64 – 67 ( blue ribbons ) are sufficient to maintain the lateral contact . The N terminus of actin has different conformations in these four modes ( black arrowheads ) .

In mode 3 SD2 is closer to the exterior of the filament ( Fig . 1c ) , further from the interstrand contact than in modes 1 and 2 ( Fig . 3a , modes 1 – 3 , cyan arrows ) . In mode 4 the D loop is disordered , and thus invisible in the reconstruction ( Fig . 1a ) . Nevertheless , the connectivity between the two actin strands is not compromised ( Fig . 3a , mode 4 , cyan arrows ) . This suggests that only the 64 – 67 region is needed for interstrand connectivity . At ~ 10 Å resolution , fine details of the actin molecule , such as the N terminus , become visible . In modes 1 – 4 this portion of actin is very variable ( Fig . 3a , black arrowheads ) . In mode 1 the N terminus is facing down , whereas in mode 2 it faces up . In mode 3 the N terminus has the strongest density among the four modes , presumably because of its stabilization by an interaction with the lower portion of SD1 , whereas in mode 4 the N­terminal density is the weakest . The position of the D loop seems to be coupled directionally with the position of the N terminus ( Fig . 3b , c ) . The observed polymorphic nature of the N terminus of actin is consistent with the proposed mobility of this region , as shown by NMR observations 17 . The coupling of structural states between the N terminus and SD2 is intriguing . Muscle actin forms filaments that are more stable than those formed by yeast actin , and because it has different dynamics it may not support yeast cell growth 37 . Three N­terminal residues determine the death or survival of yeast cells when SD1 and SD2 of yeast actin are replaced with those from muscle actin 38 . We speculate that allosteric coupling between the N terminus and SD2 explains these observations . Coupling of ATP - binding cleft and state of SD2 A substantial number of segments ( 31 % ) , arising from two different classes , were classified as having SD2 completely disordered . Only 9 % of all segments gave the best correlation with the model having SD2 completely disordered but with the ATP­binding cleft tightly closed , whereas 22 % yielded the best correlation with the model having SD2 disordered but with the cleft open . We were not able to make a reasonable reconstruction of the closed­cleft class because of the small number of segments ( n = 4 , 782 ) , whereas the set with the open cleft ( mode 5 , n = 9 , 878 ) yielded a three­dimensional ( 3D ) reconstruction ( Fig . 4 ) with a measured resolution of ~ 14 Å ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . In all atomic models of F­actin , including the most recent one 11 , SD2 of actin contributes to both longitudinal and lateral interactions that hold the filament together . We show that the actin filament can remain intact even though SD2 is completely disordered and thus absent from the EM density map . In such a filament the only longitudinal contact that maintains the filament is the one between SD4 of the lower protomer and the SD3 of the upper one ( Fig . 4b , red arrowhead ) . An actin filament with SD2 completely disordered should have decreased torsional and flexural 39 rigidity and be more heterogeneous . It is therefore not surpris­ ing that the resolution of such a relatively large set is significantly lower than that of the other four modes ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Our data show that the disordering of the D loop alone does not cause an opening of the nucleotide­binding cleft , because in mode 4 ( where the D loop is completely disordered ) the cleft is tightly closed ( Fig . 4a , black arrows ) . Our modeling suggests that residues 60 – 64 ( Fig . 4a , red ribbons ) form a contact with residues 200 – 205 located in SD4 of the same protomer ( Fig . 4a , magenta ribbons ) and residues 284 – 292 of SD3 of the upper protomer ( Fig . 4a , blue ribbons ) . This interaction holds the ATP­binding cleft , located between SD3­SD4 and SD1­SD2 , closed ( Fig . 4a , black arrows ) . When SD2 is disordered , SD1 is able to move away from SD3 , which opens the cleft ( Fig . 4b , black arrows ) . This transition between mode 4 and mode 5 is opposite to the flattening of the actin subunit that occurs upon the G­to­F transition 11 . This suggests that the interaction of residues 60 – 64 ( Fig . 4a , red rib­ bons ) with residues 200 – 205 within the same protomer and 284 – 292 from a different protomer ( Fig . 4a , magenta and blue ribbons , respec­ tively ) contribute to the flattening of actin upon polymerization . DISCUSSION Cooperativity of the observed structural states As expected from previous work , blocks of different structure are present in the same filament . Our ability to see these separate states requires cooperativity within the actin filament . If adjacent individ­ ual protomers were in random states , we would never be able to sort segments ( each containing ~ 17 protomers ) into separate classes . Our analysis shows that multiple states can be found within the same filament ( data not shown ) ; thus , the length of the ‘cooperative unit’ is much smaller than that of a typical actin filament ( containing hun­ dreds to thousands of protomers ) . There is an extensive biochemical literature describing cooperativity within the actin filament 40 – 45 , so the visualization of these cooperative blocks within the same filament is not surprising . Many of the details that we see are not new features of the actin molecule ; rather , they agree with different structural conforma­ tions of the actin molecule observed using X­ray crystallography , and they are in agreement with biochemical experiments . The role of structural polymorphism of F - actin in human disease To date , more that 177 mutations in the ACTA1 gene , encoding skeletal striated muscle actin , have been reported to cause disease a b c Figure 4 The structural states of SD2 and the ATP - binding cleft are coupled . ( a ) When the D loop is disordered in mode 4 the ATP - binding cleft ( black arrows ) remains closed , similar to modes 1 – 3 . Residues 60 – 64 ( red ribbons ) from one major domain make a contact with residues 200 – 205 ( magenta ribbons ) and residues 284 – 292 ( blue ribbons ) of the other major domain , which contribute to the closed state of the cleft . ( b ) In mode 5 the entire SD2 is disordered and the only longitudinal contact is the one between SD4 and SD3 of the adjacent actin subunits ( red arrowhead ) . Residues 60 – 64 of SD2 do not make a contact with residues 200 – 205 ( magenta ) and 284 – 292 ( blue ) , and this allows for the opening of the cleft ( black arrows ) . ( c ) The two protomers from a and b are aligned to show that when the portion of the SD2 that does not include the D loop ( residues 34 – 36 , 54 – 69 shown as black ribbons ) is disordered , the two major domains of the actin molecule move apart in the direction marked with the black arrow . © 2010 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 1322 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 11 NOVEMBER 2010 nature structural & molecular biology a r t i c l e s in humans 46 . Many of these diseases are clinically severe and lethal within the first year of life . Most of the ACTA1 gene mutations are nonsense , frameshift or splice­site mutations that cause premature termination of translation or omission of entire exons from the mRNA 47 , 48 . We analyzed missense mutations that result in a prop­ erly folded and polymerizable actin ( Fig . 5a , b , colored spheres ) . The first cluster of mutations is located at the interface between SD4 and SD3 of two adjacent actin subunits within the same helical strand ( Fig . 5a , blue spheres ) . This region is essential , because in mode 5 this is the only contact that contributes to the lateral interactions within the actin filament ( Fig . 4b , red arrowhead ) . Mutations of residue 286 cause severe nemaline myopathy ( NM ) 49 , whereas mutations of residue 292 result in the congenital fiber type disproportion ( CFTD ) 50 . Mutation of residue 241 in cytoplasmic γ ­actin results in spontaneous bundle formation by the mutant actin and is linked to hearing impair­ ment associated with the DFNA20 and DFNA26 loci 51 . The next cluster is located in SD2 of actin ( Fig . 5a , b , red spheres ) . The longitudinal contact formed by the SD2 region is not essential for filament formation in vitro , as ~ 35 % of all frozen­hydrated actin segments have SD2 partially or completely disordered . We suggest that SD2 works as an allosteric switch , and actins with mutations in the SD2 region will be deficient in their ability to undergo some vital structural alterations . Mutation of residue 40 ( D loop ) results in severe NM 50 , mutation of residue 64 causes typical NM 50 , and mutations in residue 66 are linked to both actin and nemaline myopathies 52 . We have shown that SD2 makes multiple interac­ tions with SD1 of the upper protomer , and these observations are consistent with the disease­causing mutations in the ACTA1 gene . Mutation of residue 168 ( Fig . 5a , yellow spheres ) —which neighbors Ala167 , involved in ionic bridge formation 35 —results in severe NM 50 . This mutation may alter the ability of actin to switch to mode 3 , which is very consistent with an Arg39­Ala167 ionic interaction . Residues 357 and 370 reside in the C terminus of actin ( Fig . 5a , b , magenta spheres ) , which is allosterically linked with the D loop ( Fig . 2 ) . Biochemical studies have described the existence of such coupling in both monomeric and filamentous actin 54 , 55 . Mutations at residues 357 and 370 are linked to severe NM 46 . The hydrophobic plug maintains the lateral interaction within the actin filament and is involved in allosteric structural inter­ actions with SD2 ( Fig . 3 ) as shown by biochemical studies 56 . Mutations in two hydrophobic plug residues , 263 and 268 ( Fig . 5b , cyan spheres ) , have been reported in NM cases in humans 46 . The H372R mutation ( Fig . 5c , blue spheres ) suppresses 57 the nega­ tive effects of substituting the two N­terminal acidic residues of yeast actin with four acidic residues from muscle actin ( Fig . 5c , red ribbons ) . Structural analysis of the first three modes of actin reported here suggests that there is allosteric communication through SD1 within the actin subunit between the N and C termini ( Fig . 3 ) . Mutation of residue 132 , located between the C­ and the N termini of actin ( Fig . 5c , cyan spheres ) , is linked to NM in humans 46 . Because this residue is largely buried , it cannot be interacting with ABPs and is most likely part of an essential network providing allosteric coupling between the two termini . F - actin is best understood as an ensemble of states In the case of multimeric proteins , conformational plasticity can exist within subunits as well as between subunits . We show that under in vitro conditions F­actin exists not in one structural state but in a multiplicity of states . Our best expectation in vivo is that no self­nucleated actin filaments exist . Rather , different actin filaments will be nucleated by different ABPs , and this raises the potential for these filaments to be in different structural states 42 . A single struc­ ture for F­actin cannot explain why every buried residue has been under selective pressure for hundreds of millions of years . So long as mutations do not affect the folding , one would expect that such buried residues could be substituted conservatively . The documented allosteric interactions between the hydrophobic plug , the D loop , and the N­ and C termini must , however , be transmitted through the buried residues in the core of actin , and we suggest that this may have placed the greatest selective pressure on these residues . We have shown that some of these allosteric couplings can be seen in the actin filament at modest ( ~ 10 Å ) resolution , and this is a starting point to understanding how a single protein , actin , can specifically interact with more than 150 other proteins while being involved in many different activities .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature structural & molecular biology doi : 10 . 1038 / nsmb . 1930 ONLINE METHODS Sample preparation and microscopy . Skeletal striated muscle G­actin ( 2 μ M ) was polymerized in 10 mM Mops buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 40 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 0 . 5 mM ATP for 2 – 3 h . Droplets ( 3 – 4 μ l ) were applied to glow­ discharged carbon­coated grids and were blotted and plunged within a humidi­ fied chamber into an ethane slush . All cryo­EM was done on a Tecnai F20 FEG microscope operated at 200 keV at a magnification of 50 , 000× . Image processing . The SPIDER software package 58 was used for most image processing , but the EMAN package 59 was used to determine the defocus values in the micrographs and to extract filament images from micrographs . A Nikon COOLPIX 8000 scanner was used to digitize 124 cryo­EM micrographs having a defocus range from −1 . 2 to −4 . 4 μ m at a raster of 2 . 38 Å per pixel . Initial cor­ rection for the contrast transfer function ( CTF ) was made by multiplying each image by its theoretical CTF . From these CTF­corrected images , 63 , 288 short ( 200 pixels long ) overlapping segments were extracted . Three model volumes were created by using crystal structures of G­actin 6 having actin protomers in the ‘canonical’ state , with missing SD2 , and finally in the ‘tilted’ state 13 . These volumes were scaled to 4 . 76 Å per pixel and projected into 100 × 100 pixel images with an azimuthal rotational increment of 4° , generating 270 reference projections ( 3 × 90 ) . The F­actin segments were downsampled to 4 . 76 Å per pixel and cross­ correlated with the 270 reference projections . A set of 29 , 970 segments ( 47 % ) was selected as similar to the ‘canonical’ state of F­actin , 18 , 100 segments were assigned to the SD2­disordered class ( 29 % ) , and 15 , 218 images ( 24 % ) yielded the best match with the tilted reference . Each set ( sampled at 2 . 38 Å per pixel ) was reconstructed with the IHRSR method 33 . After ~ 30 iterations , the canonical set yielded a stable solution of 166 . 6° / 27 . 5 Å , the SD2­disordered set converged to 166 . 7° / 27 . 6 Å solution , and the tilted set yielded a symmetry of 166 . 8° / 27 . 6 Å . The canonical and the SD2­disordered sets were combined ( n = 48 , 070 ) and used in subsequent sorting procedures . A set of models having SD2 of actin in different conformations was generated . An atomic model of the actin filament in the canonical state , which has the D loop in the loop conformation ( PDB entry : 2zwh ) , was used as the first model . In the second model , the SD2 of actin ( residues 34 – 69 ) was replaced with that from the crystal structure , where the DB­loop is a helix ( PDB entry : 1j6z ) , whereas in the last two models the D loop ( residues 37 – 53 ) or the whole SD2 ( residues 34 – 69 ) was removed . The five N­terminal residues were removed in each model . These volumes were scaled to 4 . 76 Å per pixel and projected into 100 × 100 pixel images with an azimuthal rotational increment of 4° , generating 360 reference projections ( 4 × 90 ) . The 48 , 070 actin segments were downsampled to 4 . 76 Å per pixel and cross­correlated with the 360 reference projections , and each class was reconstructed using the IHRSR method . The volumes were cor­ rected for the CTF ( because images had been effectively multiplied by the CTF twice , once by the microscope and once by us ) by using a Wiener filter assum­ ing that the signal­to­noise ratio in the volume was very large , and a negative B­factor of 1 , 300 was used to amplify high frequencies in the reconstruction that were damped by the envelope function of the microscope , disorder in the filaments and so on . Segments that gave the best correlation with the second reference volume ( D loop being a helix ) yielded a 3D reconstruction that had compact but weak density on the top of SD2 , and this reflected a substantial heterogeneity in the SD2 portion of the map . Several models having D loop in helical form , but in different orientations , were used for refinement . The quality of the resultant reconstructions , especially at their SD2 region , was used as a guideline in the sorting process . The best result was achieved when two models having the D­loop in a helical conformation were used ; in one model the top of SD2 was left in the ‘canonical’ position , whereas in the other model it was shifted toward the exterior of the filament . Also , to reveal whether the disor­ dering of the SD2 results in the ATP­binding cleft opening , two models of the actin filament having SD2 absent were generated , one with the cleft closed and another having the cleft opened to the extent observed in one of the crystal structures of actin 53 . Finally , six models were chosen as giving the best sorting results in terms of map quality : model with D loop being a loop ( mode 1 ) , the two models having the top of SD2 as helix in the canonical or shifted conforma­ tion ( mode 2 and mode 3 , respectively ) , a model missing the D loop ( residues 37 – 53 ) ( mode 4 ) , and the two models having the whole SD2 ( residues 34 – 69 ) removed but the cleft open ( mode 5 ) and closed . These volumes were scaled to 4 . 76 Å per pixel , projected into 100 × 100 pixel images with an azimuthal rotational increment of 4° . The resultant 540 reference projections ( 6 × 90 ) were subsequently cross­correlated with the 48 , 070 actin segments ( downsampled to 4 . 76 Å per pixel ) . Each class was reconstructed using the IHRSR method , except the class of images sorted as having the cleft closed and the SD2 dis­ ordered ( n = 4 , 782 ) , which lacked enough segments to generate reasonable volume . Mode 1 class ( n = 8 , 234 ) yielded stable solution of 166 . 6° / 27 . 5 Å , mode 2 ( n = 6 , 583 ) yielded a symmetry of 166 . 6° / 27 . 6 Å , mode 3 ( n = 11 , 169 ) converged to 166 . 6° / 27 . 6 Å , mode 4 ( n = 7 , 424 ) resulted in a 166 . 6° / 27 . 5 Å symmetry , and mode 5 ( n = 9 , 878 ) yielded a symmetry of 166 . 7° / 27 . 6 Å . The resolution for each class was determined as described earlier 60 using the Fourier Shell Correlation procedure and a conservative 0 . 5 criterion ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The five reconstructions were corrected for the CTF as described above and filtered to the measured resolution of 10 Å , except that the mode 5 reconstruction was filtered to 14 Å . The five filtered volumes were used to generate atomic models 61 ( Supplementary Methods ) . 58 . Frank , J . et al .
