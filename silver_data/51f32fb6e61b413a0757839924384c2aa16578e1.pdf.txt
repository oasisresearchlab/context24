Key words : WDR1 , Cofilin , LIMK1 , embryonic development , actin Abstract Trp - Asp ( WD ) repeat domain 1 ( WDR1 ) is a highly conserved actin binding protein across all eukaryotes and is involved in numerous actin - based processes by accelerating Cofilin severing actin filament . However , the function and the mechanism of WDR1 in mammalian early development are still largely unclear . We now report that WDR1 is essential for mouse peri - implantation development and regulates Cofilin phosphorylation in mouse cells . The disruption of maternal WDR1 does not obviously affect ovulation and female fertility . However , depletion of zygotic WDR1 results in embryonic lethal at peri - implantation stage . In WDR1 knockout cells , we found that WDR1 regulates Cofilin phosphorylation . Interestingly , WDR1 is overdosed to regulate Cofilin phosphorylation in mouse cells . Furthermore , we showed that WDR1 interacts with Lim domain kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) , a well - known phosphorylation kinase of Cofilin . Altogether , our results provide new insights into the role and mechanism of WDR1 in mouse physiological condition . Introduction The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic structure that regulates cell motility , adhesion , division and growth , and has a fundamental function in embryonic development ( 1 - 3 ) . In physiological conditions , actin filaments are continually assembled and disassembled in response to varied cellular activities ( 4 , 5 ) . The dynamics of F - actin is well orchestrated by a large number of actin binding proteins ( 5 , 6 ) . http : / / www . jbc . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1074 / jbc .

In vitro , Cofilin severs actin filament at low concentrations , while it fully decorates actin filaments and suppresses the severing activity at high concentrations ( 8 , 9 ) . In addition , Cofilin severing F - actin is not well account for how the filaments of actin cytoskeleton can be rapidly disassembled in physiological conditions ( 4 ) . Thus , the function of Cofilin in actin dynamics depends not only on its relative concentration to actin , but also on other regulatory proteins in vivo . Dysfunction of these disassembly regulating proteins results in aberrant actin cytoskeleton and various cellular and developmental defects and is related to an aberrant actin cytoskeleton in diversified processes ( 10 - 12 ) . Cofilin directly binds with actin to function as a regulator of the actin dynamics ( 13 ) . However , the phosphorylation of Cofilin at ser - 3 blocks its binding site to actin ( 14 , 15 ) . Thus , the activity of Cofilin is controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes , which are regulated by cascade reactions of several protein kinases and phosphatases . Lim domain kinases ( LIMKs ) and testis specific protein kinases ( TESKs ) are responsible for the phosphorylation of Cofilin , while slingshot ( SSH ) family protein phosphatases and pyridoxal phosphatase ( PDXP ) catalyze the dephosphorylation reaction ( 16 - 20 ) . These kinases and phosphatases are also regulated by their phosphorylation or localization in cytoplasm to maintain the level of Cofilin phosphorylation in response to extracellular stimuli ( 21 - 23 ) . The activity of Cofilin on actin disassembly is greatly accelerated by other actin binding proteins ( 24 , 25 ) . WDR1 ( WD40 domain repeat 1 , also known as actin interaction protein 1 ( AIP1 ) , is conserved and was originally identified as an actin binding protein by yeast two - hybrid screen ( 26 ) . WDR1 is involved in actin dynamics by promoting Cofilin’s actin disassembly activity . Mutations in WDR1 result in abnormal cytoskeletal behavior in many organisms ( 27 - 29 ) . A Gene - trap vector inserted Wdr1 intron 2 disrupts its expression completely and results in embryonic lethality before E10 . 5 ( embryonic day 10 . 5 ) in mouse , while a hypomorphic insertion mutation in this gene leads to autoinflammatory disease because of the impairment of cytoskeletal response in neutrophils and thrombopoiesis ( 27 ) . WDR1 - mediated actin disassembly is also required for spermatogenesis and myocardial growth in mouse development ( 30 , 31 ) . In humans , the aberrant expressions of WDR1 have been shown to be connected to several diseases , including gout , pancreatitis and primary glioblastoma ( 32 - 34 ) . Although WDR1 is critical for numerous physiological conditions , how it acts in early embryonic development remains largely unclear . In our study , we demonstrated that zygotic , but not maternal , expression of WDR1 is important for mouse early embryonic development . We showed that WDR1 is essential for mouse peri - implantation development . Most interestingly , we found that WDR1 regulates the level of Cofilin phosphorylation through LIMK , a novel mechanism of WDR1 involved in Cofilin activity . by gu e s t on D ece m b e r 25 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m WDR1 functions in Cofiloin activity and embryo development 3 Results Zygotic , Not Maternal WDR1 is Required for Mouse Development To investigate the function of Wdr1 in oocyte maturation and pre - implantation embryogenesis , we first examined the expression of Wdr1 in mouse oocytes and pre - implantation embryos by quantitative RT - PCR and Western blot . Our results showed that Wdr1 mRNA was highly expressed in mouse germinal vesicle ( GV ) oocytes , decreased in metaphase II ( MΙΙ ) oocytes , 1 - cell , 2 - cell and morula stage embryos , and then sharply increased in blastocyst stage embryos ( Fig . 1 A ) . By comparison , Western blot showed that WDR1 protein was comparatively highly expressed in GV oocytes , decreased in MII oocytes , increased in 1 - cell and 2 - cell embryos , and decreased in morula and blastocyst stage embryos again ( Fig 1 B ) . We generated Wdr1 oocyte specific knockout mice by mating Wdr1 f / f mice with Zp3 - cre transgenic mice to study the role of WDR1 in female fertility . The mRNA and protein of Wdr1 were dramatically decreased in the GV oocytes from Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre ( oocyte specific knockout , oKO ) females as noted by quantitative RT - PCR and Western blot ( Fig 1 C and D ) . However , Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre females delivered comparable offspring compared with the controls ( Wdr1 f / f and Wdr1 f / + ; Zp3 - cre females ) after mating with Wdr1 f / f males ( Fig 1 E ) . These data demonstrated that maternal WDR1 is not required for Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre female fertility . We also mated Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre females with Wdr1 f / - males . The litter size was decreased to about 50 % ( Fig 1 E ) , indicating Wdr1 KO embryos was lost during embryonic development , consistent with previous report in which severe loss function of WDR1 resulted in embryonic lethality before E10 . 5 ( 27 ) . Thus , these results suggested that zygotic , but not maternal , expression of Wdr1 is required for mouse development . WDR1 is Essential for Mouse Peri - implantation Development To examine the causes and time point of Wdr1 KO embryo lethality , Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre and Wdr1 f / f female mice mated with Wdr1 f / - male mice and the deciduas were analyzed at E5 . 5 . Our results showed that the number of deciduas per litter was 7 - 10 in both groups and were not obviously different from each other ( Fig 2 A ) . However , after sectioning and H & E staining of these deciduas , 53 % of the deciduas from Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre females had normal embryos ( Fig 2 B ( a ) ) , and 47 % had no embryos ( Fig 2 B ( b ) ) , while the percentage of empty deciduas from Wdr1 f / f females ( control ) was only 3 % ( Fig 2 B , right panel ) . These data indicated that the blastocysts lacking WDR1 were able to implant and induce the decidualization , but were absorbed at E5 . 5 , suggesting that WDR1 is essential for mouse peri - implantation development . To further investigate Wdr1 KO embryonic development , blastocysts were obtained from the uteruses of the Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre females after mating with Wdr1 f / - males at E3 . 5 and cultured in vitro . KO and control blastocysts could not be distinguished at E3 . 5 ( Fig 2 C ) . All blastocysts grew , hatched and adhered to the dish during the first 2 days of culturing . However , 55 % ( 11 of 20 ) embryos grew obviously smaller at third day . No EdU incorporation was by gu e s t on D ece m b e r 25 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m WDR1 functions in Cofiloin activity and embryo development 4 detected in smaller embryos ( Fig 2 D ) . We then examined the genotypes of these embryos by PCR with specific primers and found that the genotype of 81 % ( 9 of 11 ) of the smaller embryos were Wdr1 - / - ( Fig 2 E ) . These data suggest loss of WDR1 has no obvious effect on blastocyst development , but cause the arrested development after adherence in vitro . Wdr1 Knockout Decreases Cofilin Phosphorylation in Mouse ES cells . To investigate WDR1 functions in early embryos , we established ES cell line from Wdr1 f / - ( control , CTL ) and Wdr1 - / - ( knockout , KO ) blastocysts from Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre females after mating with Wdr1 f / - males . The Wdr1 mRNA and protein deletion were examined by real - time RT - PCR and Western blot in these ES cell lines ( Fig 3 A and B ) . Wdr1 KO ES cells could be normally maintained in a 2i / LIF medium and form typical clones ( Fig 3 D ) . The expression of pluripotent markers such as NANOG , OCT4 and SOX2 , and the cells proliferation were compared in CTL and KO ES ( Fig 3B and C ) . To investigate their differentiation potentials , CTL and KO ES cells were labeled with EGFP and injected into normal blastocysts . These blastocysts were cultured for three days in an in vitro system of growing whole embryos . Our results showed that both CTL and KO ES cells incorporated into the cultured embryos detected by EGFP ( Fig 3 D ) . The defect of Wdr1 disruption on differentiation was further examined by EB formation , a model of ESC differentiation into germ layer lineages . Compared with their expressions at day 0 ( d0 ) , germ layer makers ( Sox17 , endoderm ; T , mesoderm ; Pax6 , ectoderm ) were comparably up - regulated in both CTL and KO EB at day 3 ( d3 ) ( Fig 4 E ) . These results indicate that WDR1 depletion may not affect ES cells potential of differentiation . Previous reports showed that WDR1 partial dysfunction ( decreased to 20 % ) affected actin structure and depolarized Cofilin localization in migrating cells ( 27 ) . Then , we examined F - actin and Cofilin in Wdr1 KO ES cells by immunofluorescence . F - actin ( red ) was concentrated in the membrane in both knockout ES cells and controls ( Fig 3 F ) . The detailed actin structure could not be observed clearly in these cells . Surprisingly , different from WDR1 dysfunction in migrating cells ( 27 ) , Cofilin was more concentrated to the membrane and co - located with actin filaments in Wdr1 - / - ES cells , whereas it was more diffused in control ( Fig 3 F ) . We also investigated phosphorylated Cofilin ( P - Cofilin ) by Western blot . Our results showed that P - Cofilin level was much lower in Wdr1 - / - ES cells than that in control ( Fig 3 G ) . Then , we separated G - actin and F - actin from KO and control ES cells ( 35 ) . Distinct from previous report in Wdr1 knockdown cells ( 36 ) , F - actin level was not obviously increased in Wdr1 KO ES cells as compared to the control ( Fig 3 H ) . Altogether , Wdr1 KO has no obviously impact on ES pluripotency and growth , but results in dramatically decreased P - Cofilin in these cells . WDR1 Regulates the Phosphorylation of Cofilin and Controls F - actin in MEF cells Interestingly , WDR1 expression is much higher in MEF cells than that in ES cells ( Fig 4 A ) . To further investigate WDR1’s effects on actin cytoskeleton , by gu e s t on D ece m b e r 25 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m WDR1 functions in Cofiloin activity and embryo development 5 knockout MEF cell lines were established by a Tamoxifen induction system . Wdr1 f / - ; Cre - ER TM fetuses were used to establish inducible knockout ( iKO ) MEF lines , using Wdr1 + / - ; Cre - ER TM MEF cells as the control ( CTL ) . After 72 h treatment with Tamoxifen , Wdr1 mRNA and protein were decreased to 0 . 3 % ± 0 . 018 % and 4 . 5 % ± 0 . 2 % , respectively , compared with control ( CTL ) ( Fig 4 B and C ) . Actin plaques were observed in Wdr1 iKO MEF cells , whereas clear linear F - actin structure in control ( Fig 4 D ) . However , we did not detect a significant increase in overall F - actin level in Wdr1 iKO MEF cells ( Fig 4 E ) . P - Cofilin was observed to be dramatically decreased in Wdr1 iKO MEF cells ( Fig 4 F ) . We also examined the cell cycle by flow cytometry . Our results showed that control MEF cells had complete G1 , S and G2 cell stages , while in Wdr1 iKO MEF cells S stage could not be detected accompanying G1 and expanding G2 cell stages ( Fig 4 G ) . These data suggested that WDR1 loss affected MEF cell proliferation . Altogether , these results indicate that WDR1 regulates the formation of special actin plaques , the proliferation , Cofilin phosphorylation in MEF cells . WDR1 Regulates Phosphorylation of Cofilin in a Dose - independent Manner . The dramatically decreased P - Cofilin in Wdr1 KO cells was inconsistent with a previous report for Wdr1 knockdown cells ( 36 ) , suggesting WDR1 might be overdosed in cells . To test this hypothesis , we used the Tamoxifen induction system to gradually reduce WDR1 content and examined the level of P - Cofilin during this process . WDR1 , P - Cofilin and Cofilin were detected in Wdr1 f / - ; Cre - ER TM and control MEF cells after Tamoxifen treatment 0 , 24 , 48 and 72 h . In Wdr1 f / - ; Cre - ER TM MEF cells , WDR1 protein gradually reduced at the time course manner and almost failed to be detected at 72 h ( Fig 5 A ) . Although the protein levels of WDR1 were obviously decreased at 24 and 48 h , P - Cofilin was comparable to the control levels at these time points . The decreased P - Cofilin was only clearly observed at 72 h after Tamoxifen treatment ( Fig 5 A ) . Consistently , the actin plaques were obviously observed at 72 h , but could not be found at 24 h and only a small number of actin plaques were observed at 48 h ( Fig 5 B ) . These results suggest that WDR1 regulating Cofilin phosphorylation is overdosed in cells . To further examine the regulation of WDR1 on Cofilin phosphorylation , WDR1 was over - expressed in both ES and MEF cells . Cofilin phosphorylation was not obviously different in both WDR1 over - expressed and control cells ( Fig 5 C and D ) . When WDR1 was re - expressed in knockout ES cells , P - Cofilin was obviously increased and comparable to the control ( Fig 5 E ) . WDR1 Regulates Cofilin Phosphorylation via LIMK1 To investigate how WDR1 regulates Cofilin phosphorylation , WDR1 with a Flag tag was over - expressed in MEF cells and an IP experiment was performed with Flag antibody . Our results showed that WDR1 interacted with LIMK1 , but not SSH1 , PDXP and TESK1 ( Fig 6 A ) . Then , mouse LIMK1 was over - expressed with a HA tag from the first ATG ( full length , LIMK1 - FL ) , from 415 bases ( deleted two Lim domains , LIMK1 - 415 ) or from 766 bases ( deleted two Lim domains and PAZ domain , LIMK1 - 766 ) in 293T cells ( Fig 6 B ) . Mouse WDR1 with a Myc tag was by gu e s t on D ece m b e r 25 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m WDR1 functions in Cofiloin activity and embryo development 6 co - expressed in these cells . Our results showed that the LIMK1 - FL and LIMK1 - 415 , but not LIMK1 - 766 , pulled down WDR1 ( Fig 6 B ) . We then examined the levels of P - LIMK1 and total LIMK1 in control and Wdr1 KO MEF cells . Our results showed that both P - LIMK1 and total LIMK1 levels were almost similar in control and KO MEF cells ( Fig 6 C ) . Previous reports showed that LIMK1 activity was inhibited by binding with BMP - RII ( Bone morphogenetic proteins receptor II ) or microtubules ( 21 , 37 , 38 ) . Beacause the LIMK1 antibody did not work well for immunostaining , LIMK1 with Myc tag was over - expressed in control and Wdr1 KO MEF cells to examine whether WDR1 regulates LIMK1 by changing its localization . Our results showed that LIMK1 was diffused in both control and KO MEF cells , but was more concentrated to microtubules in Wdr1 KO MEF cells . We then treated the MEF cells to lightly damage microtubule structure with Small dosage nocodazol ( 1 . 25  g / ml ) , a microtubules depolymerization reagent , and examined P - Cofilin by Western blot in these cells . Our results showed that P - Cofilin was upregulated in Wdr1 KO MEF cells , but was virtually unchanged in control ( Fig 6 E ) . Our IP experiment showed that WDR1 interacts with the PDZ domain of LIMK1 which is a microtubule binding domain ( 17 ) . Thus , we concluded that WDR1 might regulate LIMK1 function by inhibiting its binding to microtubules . Lacking of WDR1 Decreases Cofilin Phoshporylation and Disturbs Actin Structure in Both Mouse Blastocyst Outgrowth and Oocytes To examine effects of WDR1 loss on F - actin and Cofilin phosphorylation during embryonic development , the blastocysts cultured in vitro for 3 days were stained by phalloidin . Actin filaments were orderly and homogeneous in the control ( CTL ) , whereas random actin plaques were observed in Wdr1 - / - ( knockout , KO ) blastocyst outgrowth ( Fig 7 A ) . P - Cofilin level in KO outgrowth was much lower than that in control ( Fig 7 B ) . F - actin and P - Cofilin were also examined in mouse GV oocytes by staining and Westernblot . Our results showed that actin was concentrated to some small plaques in the cytoplasm of Wdr1 - / - ( oocyte specific knockout , oKO ) GV oocytes ( Fig 7 C , arrowheads ) , while was uniformly distributed in Wdr1 f / f ( control , CTL ) ( Fig 7 C ) . P - Cofilin was also dramatically decreased in Wdr1 - / - GV oocytes compared with the control ( Fig 7 D ) . Discussion WDR1 and its involvement in actin cytoskeleton play important roles in multiple processes during mouse development mouse ( 27 , 30 , 31 ) . However , the role of WDR1 in mouse early embryogenesis is still largely unknown . In our present study , we showed that the depletion of Wdr1 in oocytes by Zp3 - cre has no impact on ovulation and pre - implantation embryogenesis , and the oocyte - specific KO females deliver offspring comparable to the controls when they are mated with wild type males . Furthermore , Wdr1 KO ES cells can be established and have no obvious defects in the pluripotency and proliferation . Mouse embryos depleted with zygotic Wdr1 are lost at a very early stage of development at E5 . 5 although these embryos can implant and induce by gu e s t on D ece m b e r 25 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m WDR1 functions in Cofiloin activity and embryo development 7 decidualization . Consistently , Wdr1 KO blastocyst embryos can hatch and adhere , but impaired the outgrowth and cannot be labeled with EdU , accompanying the severe defects of actin cytoskeleton . Wdr1 KO MEF cells have growth defects such as losing S phase and abnormal actin plaques , similar to the phenotypes observed in Wdr1 specific KO cardiomyocytes and sertoli cells ( 30 , 31 ) . For successful development , mouse trophoblast cells dramatically differentiate and proliferate , accompanying tremendous changes in cytoskeleton after implantation ( 39 , 40 ) . Although the exact reason that WDR1 loss of function results in the embryonic arrest at E5 . 5 is unknown , WDR1’s involved role in actin cytoskeleton might be critical in the differentiation and growth of trophoblast cells . Thus , the function of WDR1 regulating actin disassembly might be cell - type specific manner for cell proliferation and survival . Taken together , our results demonstrate that WDR1 plays essential roles in mouse peri - implantation development . Cofilin is important for spatial and temporal regulation of F - actin dynamics in cells and its activity is tightly controlled by several mechanisms ( 7 , 41 , 42 ) . However , which mechanism is most important process for Cofilin severing activity is still unclear . Cofilin binding and severing F - actin activity is dependent upon its phosphorylation which is tightly regulated by the protein kinases and phosphatases in vivo , such as LIMK and SSH ( 15 , 42 ) . In response to the stimuli , the kinases phosphorylate , while the phosphatases dephosphorylate Cofilin to control its interaction with actin for optimal severing activity to regulate the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton ( 14 , 44 ) . In addition , some small molecules or actin - binding proteins ligands can competitively displace Cofilin to decrease the binding density of this protein on F - actin into a range that favors severing activity ( 43 , 44 ) . These results suggest that the regulation of Cofilin binding to F - actin is controlled by multiple mechanisms and might be the primary process for Cofilin severing activity in vivo . Most studies have shown that WDR1 significantly accelerated Cofilin dissembling of actin cytoskeleton . However , how WDR1 regulates Cofilin severing activity remains obscure . At present study , we established Wdr1 KO ES , MEF cells , oocytes , and early embryos to investigate the regulation of WDR1 on Cofilin . Unexpectedly , we found the loss of WDR1 downregulates P - Cofilin in all examined cells . Consistent with this , a very recent report showed that P - Cofilin is decreased in the cells of some patients with Wdr1 mutation ( 45 ) . Interestingly , WDR1 seem to be present in excessive amount in the in cells , which well explains the discrepancies of Cofilin phosphorylation levels observed in knock down and KO cells ( 36 ) . We also found that WDR1 interacts with LIMK1 PDZ region , which was reported to bind to microtubule ( 17 ) . In addition , LIMK1 is concentrated to the microtubules in Wdr1 KO MEF cells and the disassembly of microtubules can partly rescue the phosphorylated Cofilin in these cells . Previous reports show that the PDZ domain is a cytoskeleton binding domain and PDZ domain can localize LIMK1 to the microtubules ( 21 , 37 , 38 ) . Thus , these results suggest that WDR1 might inhibit the binding of LIMK1 to microtubules and release by gu e s t on D ece m b e r 25 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m WDR1 functions in Cofiloin activity and embryo development 8 LIMK1 to cytoplasm to catalyze Cofilin phosphorylation , therefore regulating Cofilin’s binding to F - actin . Previous results show that WDR1 can bind to Cofilin - actin and induces F - actin structural changes to accelerate Cofilin severing F - actin activity ( 9 ) . In addition , another report shows that WDR1 might simply compete with Cofilin and dissociate redundant Cofilin from F - actin to accelerate severing activity ( 44 ) . Furthermore , this regulation of Cofilin severing activity is dependent on the pH ( 46 ) . In our study , we found WDR1 regulated Cofilin phosphorylation through LIMK1 to control the binding of Cofilin with actin filaments . Thus , WDR1 regulates Cofilin severing F - actin activity at multiple layers , suggesting the interrelation of WDR1 and Cofilin is very complex in vivo . It is worth mentioning that WDR1 depletion decreases the level of Cofilin phosphorylation and disrupts actin structure in mouse oocytes , but does not affect oocyte maturation and fertilization . Similar observations are also reported in some other cytoskeleton relative proteins in mouse oocytes ( 47 ) . These results indicate mouse oocytes and very early embryos might have tolerance to some level of actin deficiency . Taking together , our results demonstrate that WDR1 is essential for mouse peri - implantation development and regulates Cofilin phosphorylation through LIMK1 to optimize its F - actin severing activity in vivo . Experimental Procedures Mice Maintenance In compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences , the Wdr1 f / f ; Zp3 - cre and Wdr1 f / f ; Cre - ER TM mouse lines were maintained on a mixed background ( 129 / C57BL / 6 ) . A pair of Flox sequences was inserted in both ends of the fourth exon of Wdr1 to establish Wdr1 f / f mice as previously described ( 31 ) . Zp3 - cre mice ( 48 ) were mated with Wdr1 f / f mice to obtain the oocyte specific Wdr1 knockout females . To establish Wdr1 inducible knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF ) cell lines , Wdr1 f / - mice were mated with Cre - ER TM transgenic mice ( 49 ) to obtain Wdr1 + / - ; Cre - ER TM offspring . E13 . 5 fetuses from the mating of Wdr1 + / - ; Cre - ER TM females with Wdr1 f / - males were used to derive the MEF cells . All mice were maintained in SPF animal houses with a 12 h light / 12 h dark cycle . Mouse tail tip or cells were lysed by an alkaline lysate buffer at 95°C for 1 h . Then genotyping PCR was conducted with specific primers ( Table 1 ) . Collection and Culture of Mouse Eggs and Embryos Germinal vesicle ( GV ) oocytes were collected using M199 medium from ovaries . After female mice were stimulated by injecting PMSG and hCG ( Ningbo Second Hormone Factory ) , metaphase II ( MII ) oocytes were collected in M2 medium from oviducts after hCG 13 h ; 1 - cell , 2 - cell embryos and morulas were flushed from oviducts at E0 . 5 , E1 . 5 and E2 . 5 days ; and blastocysts were collected from uteruses at E3 . 5 .

P - 9688 , LC Laboratories ) , CHIR99021 ( 3  M , catalog no . C - 6556 , LC Laboratories ) and leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF , 1000 units / ml , catalog no . ESG1107 , Millipore ) ( 2i / LIF medium ) for 5 days . Then , the inner cell mass clones were digested by trypsin substitute and planted onto MEF cell feeder in 2i / LIF medium or DMEM containing 15 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM sodium pyruvate , 2 mM L - glutamine , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids , 50  g / ml penicillin / streptomycin , 0 . 1 mM  - mercaptoethanol , and 10 ng / ml leukemia inhibitory factor ( ES serum medium ) . For cell number counting , ES cultured on gelatin were digested to single cells and counted in a blood counting chamber . All cell lines were cultured at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . ES cells differentiation ES cells were labelled with EGFP , digested to single cells , resuspended in DMEM with 15 % FBS , and kept on ice . Blastocysts were collected from the uterus of E3 . 5 superovulated ICR females . 10 - 15 ES cells were picked up and injected into one blastocyst cavity by an injection pipette . The injected blastocysts were cultured in gelatin pre - treated dishes for three days . ES cells in the chimeras were detected by fluorescence confocal microscopy . For embryoid bodies ( EB ) formation , ES cells were digested to single cells and cultured by seeding 600 cells in one 30 - μl hanging droplets of ES serum medium without LIF . Real - time RT - PCR Total RNA was extracted from cells with the RNAzol® RT RNA Isolation Reagent ( Molecular Research Center ) and was isolated in oocytes and pre - implantation embryos with the Dynabeads mRNA Direct Micro Kit ( Ambion ) . It was then reverse transcripted with the PrimeScriptTM RT - PCR kit ( Takara ) . The primer sequences were listed in Table 1 . Real time PCR was carried out in the All - In - One RT Master Mix G490 system ( Applied Biological Materials , ABM ) . GAPDH was used as a reference gene for normalization of the mRNA levels .
