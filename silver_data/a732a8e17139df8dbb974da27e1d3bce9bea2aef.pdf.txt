Scope of the review : This review deals with the mechanisms of aluminum ( III ) , cobalt ( III ) , uranium ( VI ) , gallium ( III ) and bismuth ( III ) uptake by transferrin and interaction with receptor 1 . Major conclusions : The interaction of the metal - loaded transferrin with receptor 1 takes place in one or two steps : a very fast ﬁ rst step ( μ s to ms ) between the C - lobe and the helical domain of the receptor , and a second slow step ( 2 – 6 h ) between the N - lobe and the protease - like domain . In transferrin loaded with metals other than iron , the dissociation constants for the interaction of the C - lobe with TFR are in a comparable range of magnitudes 10 to 0 . 5 μ M , whereas those of the interaction of the N - lobe are several orders of magnitudes lower or not detected . Endocytosis occurs in minutes , which implies a possible internalization of the metal - loaded transferrin with only the C - lobe interacting with the receptor . General signi ﬁ cance : A competition with iron is possible and implies that metal internalization is more related to kinetics than thermodynamics . As for metal release in the endosome , it is faster than the recycling time of transferrin , which implies its possible liberation in the cell .

Introduction The transport and incorporation of metals other than iron by transferrins is a very intriguing tale indeed . Human serum transferrin is known to form stable complexes with more than forty metallic cations , which include transition metals , actinides and metals of group 13 of the periodic table [ 1 – 3 ] . However , as attractive as this hypothesis may sound , we should always keep in mind that transferrin is a metal solubilizerinthebloodstreamandthat , alone , itcannottransportironto its targets inside the cells [ 4 ] . In order to do so , the metal - loaded transferrin needs to interact mainly with transferrin receptor 1 or , to a lesser extent , with receptor 2 [ 5 – 7 ] . The interaction with the receptor leadstotheendocytosisofthetransferrin / receptoradductinthecytosol [ 6 ] . TheendosomesformedthenundergoadropintheirinnerpH , which leads to the release of iron , or eventually other metals , from the protein / protein adduct , to the reduction of Fe ( III ) to Fe ( II ) and to its active transport from the endosome to its targets in the cell [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] . The endosome is recycled back to the plasma membrane , where transferrin is released intheneutralbiological ﬂ uidready foranewironacquisition cycle [ 6 ] . Therefore , it can easily be assumed that the formation of a stable complex between a metal and transferrin is only one of several steps involved in its possible transport by the iron acquisition pathway . We shall deal here with the mechanisms of iron , cobalt , bismuth , aluminum , gallium and uranium uptake by human serum transferrin ( T ) and with the interactions of the metal - loaded transferrins with receptor 1 [ 4 , 10 – 15 ] . We shall also deal with the mechanism of iron release in vitro from the holotransferrin ( TFe 2 ) / receptor 1 adduct in acidic media and transpose this process to metals other than iron [ 16 ] . The structures of human serum transferrin ( T ) and receptor 1 were reported and analyzed in this issue by K . Mizutami . They will , therefore , not be developed further here . However , we should remind the reader that transferrin is a glycoprotein of 700 aminoacids organized in two semi - equivalent lobes , each of which contains an iron - binding site composedoftwophenolsoftwotyrosines , acarboxylateofanaspartate , an imidazole of a histidine and a synergistic carbonate adjacent to an arginine . Earlier studies , by X - ray solution scattering and more recently the crystal structure of the protein led to the conclusion that the apo ( iron - free ) and holo ( iron - saturated ) forms of transferrin exist for the majorityofthetimeinwell - de ﬁ nedspeci ﬁ cconformationsrepresenting Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 334 – 347 Abbreviations : T , apotransferrin ; T C , the C - lobe of apotransferrin in an unknown state of charge and protonation ; T C Fe , C - site - loaded monoferric transferrin ; TFe 2 , TAl 2 , TGa 2 , TCo 2 , TBi 2 , metal - saturated transferrins ; Ur , uranyl ( UO 22 + ) ; TUr 2 , uranyl - saturated transferrin ; TFR , transferrin receptor 1 subunit ; TFR a , the acidic form of TFR ; TFR - TFe 2 , - TGa 2 , - TCo 2 , - TBi 2 , metal - loaded transferrin receptor 1 protein / protein adduct ; NTA , nitrilotriacetate ; AHA , acetohydroxamic acid ; HFE , hemochromatosis protein ☆ ThisarticleispartofaSpecialIssueentitledTransferrins : Molecularmechanismsof iron transport and disorders . ⁎ Corresponding author .

In the open conformation of the apoform of transferrin , the protein ligands are in direct contact with the bulk medium . When it is iron - loaded , each lobe enclosesthecoordinatedmetal , whichbecomesburiedabout10 Åunder thesurface of the protein in theclosed conformation ( SchemeI ) [ 18 , 19 ] . Receptor 1 is a 190 kDa homodimeric protein arranged in two subunits ( TFR ) linked by two disul ﬁ de bridges . The receptor contains a transmembrane domain , a cytoplasmic endodomain of about 15 kDa and a soluble ectodomain directed towards the biological ﬂ uid . The ectodomain is arranged in three domains : the helical , the apical and the protease - like , which forms a pseudo - cavity of about 10 Å with the plasma membrane [ 20 ] . The endodomain consists of a transmem - brane segment and a cytosolic part . The C - lobe of holotransferrin ( TFe 2 ) or that of a C - lobe - only iron - loaded transferrin interacts with the helical domain , whereas the N - lobe interacts with protease - like domain in the cavity with the plasma membrane [ 21 ] . As written above , the ﬁ rst step in the iron acquisition pathway is the formation of a complex between Fe ( III ) and T . Fe ( III ) is almost insoluble in aqueous neutral media , where it readily precipitates as different iron hydroxides [ 22 ] . Fe ( III ) is usually solubilized under the form of chelates or complexed to proteins or macromolecules . In the bloodstream , of normal individuals practically all the circulating iron is complexed to transferrin and another in ﬁ nitesimal part is complexed to ceruloplasmin [ 23 ] . It is generally accepted that in the normal individual about 0 . 1 % of the total body iron ( i . e . about 3 to 4 mg ) is in the plasma , bound predominantly to transferrin ( which is approximately 30 % saturated with iron ) . The daily turnover of iron is about 30 mg , so transferrin is continually binding iron ( both dietary and “ recycled ” iron ) and delivering it to cells and tissues [ 9 , 22 ] . Ceruloplasmin ( Cp ) is a blood - circulating protein , which plays a major role in iron and copper homeostasis [ 24 , 25 ] . More than 95 % of the copper in the plasma is bound to Cp , which also possesses two iron - binding sites [ 23 ] . Cp is , in addition , one of the major ferroxidases involved in the Fe ( II ) to Fe ( III ) oxidation . Transferrin forms complexes with Fe ( III ) and lacks any signi ﬁ cant af ﬁ nity for Fe ( II ) , which is readily oxidized in aerobic media [ 26 ] . How , then , is iron acquired by transferrin ? Several possibilities are envisaged . We shall only report two . The ﬁ rst is required for the understanding of the uptake of metals other than iron by transferrin . It concerns metal transfer from the so - called low - molecular - weight iron pool to transferrin . This iron pool is assumed to consist of undetectable concentrations of iron ( III ) complexed to low mass chelators ( FeL ) [ 9 ] . The second very interesting theory assumes that iron ( III ) is transferred from ceruloplasmin to transferrin , after the oxidation of iron ( II ) , in a protein / protein adduct formed by the interaction of the two proteins ( Scheme II ) [ 27 ] . This hypothesis shall not be further discussed here . 2 . Metal transfer from a low - molecular - mass chelate to transferrin The mechanisms of iron and metal transfer from chelate to transferrin proposed here are those we have established since the mid - nineties , essentially by means of the methods and techniques of fastkineticsassociatedwithspectrophotometricdetectionandtitration . Apotransferrin ( T ) , transferrin with only its C - site iron - loaded ( T C Fe ) and holotransferrin ( TFe 2 ) have speci ﬁ c absorption and intrinsic emission spectra ( Fig . 1 ) [ 28 ] , which makes it possible to follow the kinetics of iron uptake by spectrophotometric techniques . In earlier observations , based onstopped - ﬂ ow mixingassociatedwithabsorption spectroscopy , Batesetal . showed thatiron can be very rapidlyextracted by transferrin from low mass chelates , such as Fe ( III ) nitrilotriacetate ( FeNTA ) or Fe ( III ) acetohydroxamate ( FeAHA ) [ 29 , 30 ] . These observa - tions were afterwards completed and extended to lactoferrin and ovotransferrin [ 15 , 31 – 33 ] . This approach was also applied to other metal chelates , such as aluminum citrate , bismuth nitrilotriacetate , gallium nitrilotriacetate , cobalt nitrilotriacetate – carbonate and uranyl carbonate [ 3 , 4 , 10 – 12 , 14 ] . The stopped - ﬂ ow apparatus set - up is a fast - mixing device ( ~ 1 ms ) associated with a fast detection technique , such as a spectrophotometer , which allows the analysis of the kinetic processes occurring in the range of milliseconds to the few seconds ( Fig . 2 ) [ 10 ] . Other , different , approaches were used with several other metals [ 1 , 2 , 34 – 39 ] . 2 . 1 . Iron - uptake by transferrin When a neutral solution of apotransferrin is rapidly mixed with a neutral solution of FeNTA or FeAHA in the presence of bicarbonate , four kinetic processes are detected by ﬂ uorescence emission in the 300 to 400 nm range with an excitation wavelength λ ex = 280 nm . The ﬁ rst is fast and occurs in the 0 . 1 s range as an exponential decrease in ﬂ uorescence emission . It is followed by an exponential decrease in the emission , which , however , occurs in the second range . The third and fourth kinetic phenomena take place in the 100 s and the 1000 s range , respectively ( Fig . 3 ) .

El Hage Chahine et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 334 – 347 propose a general mechanism for iron transfer from a chelate to apotransferrin in the presence of bicarbonate [ 15 , 32 ] . Chemical relaxation is a kinetic approach for the analysis of fast kinetic processes in the fundamental state . It was developed in the sixties by Manfred Eigen et al . [ 40 , 41 ] . In neutral physiological media , about 30 % the C - lobe of transferrin interacts with bicarbonate , whereas the N - lobe does not [ 42 ] . Although transferrin can be found in the blood stream with the N - lobe iron - loaded and the C - lobe iron - free [ 43 ] , the thermodynamic and kinetic data ( Table 1 , Eq . ( 2 ) ) clearly indicate that the ﬁ rst process in Fig . 3A is that of an iron ( III ) transfer from the chelate to the iron - binding site in the C - lobe of transferrin interacting with the bicarbonate [ 42 ] . This process is accompanied by a proton loss and corresponds to a ﬁ rst complex formation between a phenolate of one of the tyrosines and Fe ( III ) . It is immediately followed by a fast change in the conformation of the lobe , leading to a second proton loss and allowing a new coordination between the phenolate of the second tyrosine and the metal ( Fig . 3B ) . During this conformational change , the two domains of the C - lobe start to enclose the metal like a pair of jaws . This process ( Figs . 3B ) triggers another conformational change accompanied by proton losses affecting the whole protein , including the N - lobe , which rate - controls a very fast second iron ( III ) uptake if the metal is available [ 32 ] . It is followed by a ﬁ nal conformational change allowing the C - lobe - only iron - loaded transferrin and / or holotransferrin to achieve its ﬁ nal state of equilibrium ( Table 1 , Eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 11 ) ) [ 15 , 32 ] . During these four processes , the conformation of the protein transits from open for apotransferrin to closed for holotransferrin , where iron is coordinated to the four protein ligands of Scheme I and also completely protected from the outside medium . In this multistep system , the af ﬁ nity of the C - lobe of protein for iron grows from 10 16 M − 1 for the ﬁ rst kinetic intermediate up to about 10 21 M − 1 , whereas that of the N - lobe attains 10 20 M − 1 [ 15 , 44 ] . 2 . 2 . The role of the donor chelate in metal uptake Metal uptake by transferrin depends on the nature of the metal - providing chelates , which can roughly be classi ﬁ ed in three groups . In the ﬁ rst , as for iron in the case of FeNTA and FeAHA , the metal dissociation is fast and does not rate - control iron uptake [ 15 ] . In the second case , as for iron - citrate , it is extremely slow [ 45 , 46 ] and metal - binding becomes rate - controlled by chelate dissociation [ 15 , 45 ] . There is also a third case , which will be developed further . In this latter case , the chelate is either a mixed complex already containing the carbonate ligand , such as CoNTACO 32 − or a tricarbonate complex , such as UO 2 ( CO 3 ) 34 − [ 11 , 47 ] . 2 . 3 . Aluminum , gallium and bismuth uptake by transferrin In Table 1 , we summarize the mechanisms of metal transfer from FeNTA , FeAHA , Al ( III ) citrate , Ga ( III ) nitrilotriacetate and Bi ( III ) nitrilo - triacetate to transferrin . All these chelates seem to dissociate quite rapidly and their dissociation does not rate - control metal uptake by transferrin . When a solution of each of them is mixed , by stopped - ﬂ ow , with T in the presence of HCO 3 − , three kinetic processes are detected by spectrophotometric absorption or emission monitoring in , however , extremely different time ranges . They resemble those observed for iron uptake ( Fig . 3 ) andwillnot , therefore , bereproducedhere [ 4 , 10 , 14 ] . The ﬁ rst is ascribed to metal transfer from the chelate to the C - lobe iron - binding site ( Table 1 , Eqs . ( 12 ) , ( 20 ) , ( 28 ) ) . The second and third are ascribedtoconformationalchange affectingthewhole proteinand rate - 300 320 340 360 380 400 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 F l uo r e sc en c e I n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) λ ( nm ) TFe2 TcFe T A 425 450 475 500 525 550 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 ε ( M - 1 . c m - 1 ) λ ( nm ) T TcFe TFe2 B Fig . 1 .

El Hage Chahine et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 334 – 347 controlling metal uptake by the N - lobe binding site ( Table 1 , Eqs . ( 3 ) – ( 11 ) , ( 13 ) – ( 19 ) , ( 21 ) – ( 27 ) , ( 29 ) – ( 31 ) ) . These processes are fast for bismuth , where they occur in less than 100 ms for metal transfer from chelate to the C - lobe binding site , and less than 0 . 5 and 50 s for the second and third conformational changes , respectively [ 14 ] . With aluminum and gallium , the time ranges vary from about 50 s for the ﬁ rst and 1000 and 60 , 000 s for the two following processes [ 4 , 10 ] . This clearly implies that bismuth transfer from BiNTA to transferrin occurs very rapidly and that the Bi - loaded protein attains its ﬁ nal equilibrated state in a few seconds ( Table 1 ) . This occurs with high af ﬁ nities ( 10 18 – 10 19 M − 1 ) despite the ionic radius of Bi 3 + ( 1 . 03 Å ) and the suspected structure of the Bi - loaded transferrin in which the lobes are in a semi - closed conforma - tion with bismuth in partial contact with the bulk medium [ 14 , 48 ] . With bismuth citrate , Bi ( III ) - uptake is slowed down to several hours [ 48 ] . This , again , underlines the important role played by the rate of chelate dissociation in metal uptake by transferrin . With gallium and aluminum , metal transfer becomes rather slow and the ﬁ nal equilibrium is only attained after several hours [ 4 , 10 ] . 2 . 4 . Why metal uptake ﬁ rst occurs by the C - lobe binding site ? Metal uptake by transferrins requires a synergistic anion , without which it does not occur [ 31 , 49 – 51 ] . The naturally occurring synergistic anion is HCO 3 − , which is involved in the buffering of natural media [ 50 , 52 ] . However , in vitro and with some bacterial transferrins , several anions can play such a role [ 49 , 50 , 53 – 56 ] . On the other hand , in physiological media , 30 % of the C - lobe of T is in interaction with HCO 3 − , whereas the N - lobe hardly interacts with the synergistic anion ( Table 1 , Eq . ( 1 ) ) [ 31 , 42 , 51 ] . Furthermore , in holotransferrin , a carbonate , adjacent to an arginine , is a part of the coordination sphere of the metal [ 57 ] . Therefore , the presence of HCO 3 − in the C - lobe of transferrin should considerably facilitate the ﬁ rst step in the coordination to the metal [ 31 , 51 ] . This step is accompanied by three proton losses , one from the bicarbonate and the two others from the phenols of the tyrosines ( Table 1 ) [ 32 , 44 , 52 , 58 ] . This can also explain the close similarities between the mechanisms of metal transfers to T from Al ( III ) , Bi ( III ) and Ga ( III ) chelates and that of Fe ( III ) . Indeed , all occur ﬁ rst with the binding site in the C - lobe and then with that in the N - lobe ( Table 1 ) . What can now happen if the metal - providing chelate has carbonate as a ligand ? 2 . 5 . Uranyl and cobalt uptake by transferrin from uranyl tricarbonate and the mixed Co ( III ) carbonate nitrilotriacetate complex In Table 2 , we summarize the mechanisms of uranyl and cobalt uptake by transferrin .

The latter yields another kinetic product in a process , which appears as an exponential decrease of the emission occurring in the range of a second ( Fig . 4B ) . These two processes are followed by two other kinetic phenomena during which the Ur - saturated T attains its thermodynamic state of equilibrium ( Fig . 4C ) . The third is an exponential increase in absorption in tens of minutes . It is followed by an increase in absorption lasting about 6 h .

These two processes initiate a series of slow to very slow conformational changes ( Table 2 , Eq . ( 36 ) ) . They affect the whole transferrin , including the N - lobe , and allow the N - binding site to complex a second uranyl . The ﬁ rst process in uranyl uptake by transferrin is faster than that observed with iron because the synergistic anion is provided by the metal / donor complex . As for the slowest steps , they seem to be quite similar with , however , rates different from those observed for the uptake of other metals , such as iron , aluminum , bismuth and gallium ( Tables 1 and 2 ) [ 4 , 10 , 14 , 15 , 47 ] . A multi - process system is also observed for cobalt uptake from the mixed nitrilotriacetate – carbonate complex CoNTACO 32 − . Here the ﬁ rst step becomes much too fast for a stopped - ﬂ ow detection . It was detected by the temperature - jump technique ( T - jump ) . T - jump is based on Joule heating by the discharge of a capacitor through the solution . Heating times can be as low as 200 ns and heating amplitudes as high as 12 °C . This technique allows us to deal with kinetic runs occurring in the μ s to ms range ( Fig . 5 ) [ 11 , 40 , 41 ] . In our case , the detection was based on the variations in absorption or ﬂ uorescence emission ( Fig . 6 ) [ 11 ] . The ﬁ rst step in the cobalt – transferrin complex formation occurs in less than 2 ms . It corresponds to a CoCO 3 + transfer from the mixed CoNTACO 32 − complex to the C - lobe of transferrin ( Eq .

El Hage Chahine et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 334 – 347 with T C H m , the C - lobe with all ligands protonated in an unknown state . This ﬁ rst process is followed by three slower processes lasting from about 50 s to more than 24 h , during which the ﬁ rst kinetic product undergoes a series of proton losses triggering conformational changes similar to , but however slower , than those observed for iron . These changes allow the N - site to complex a second cobalt ( Table 2 , Eqs . ( 38 ) – ( 40 ) ) [ 11 ] . 2 . 6 . Some general considerations about metal uptake by transferrin Analysis of the mechanisms in Tables 1 and 2 clearly shows that , apart from the case of the mixed carbonate or carbonate complexes , the ﬁ rst step in metal uptake is that of the interaction of the C - lobe of the protein with HCO 3 − . In serum ( [ HCO 3 − ] ~ 20 – 25 mM ) , we have already mentioned that the C - lobe and an insigni ﬁ cant part of the N - lobe are interacting with bicarbonate [ 42 ] . This renders the N - lobe much less reactive than the C - lobe towards metal uptake . Neverthe - less , metal transfer from the chelate to the C - lobe leads to a series of events , mainly conformational changes , triggered by proton losses from the protein ligands and from some aminoacids situated in each of the two domains that surround the binding cleft in each lobe . These proton losses produce a sort of a zipping effect , which allows the protein ligands to complex the metal and interdomain hydrogen bonding to occur [ 65 ] . This initiates the indispensible changes in conformation that bring the ligands close to the metal . This subsequently leads to the transition from the open structure , in which the ligands are in contact with the bulk medium , to the closed structure , in which the ligands are engaged in the complex and the metal is enclosed in the binding cleft ( Scheme I ) [ 15 , 65 – 68 ] , This case is , however , quite different with at least three metallic cations , Al 3 + , Bi 3 + and UO 22 + . Indeed , in these cases metal - loaded transferrin is assumed to be in a semi - closed conformation in which the metal is not fully included in the binding clefts of the two lobes and , thus , partly in contact with bulk medium [ 59 , 61 , 69 , 70 ] . This can explain the comparatively low af ﬁ nities of the protein for aluminum or uranyl , but not the high af ﬁ nity for bismuth [ 1 , 2 , 59 , 61 , 69 , 70 ] . 3 . Interaction of metal - loaded transferrins with receptor 1 Aluminum , bismuth , gallium cobalt and uranyl form stable complexes with transferrin [ 1 , 2 , 70 ] , but in sera , aluminum is partly complexed to citrate and uranyl is shared between the carbonate and to a lesser extent the transferrin complexes . In contrast , bismuth , gallium and cobalt are mainly complexed to transferrin [ 1 , 2 , 27 , 37 , 59 , 60 , 69 ] . Therefore , transferrin can be involved in these metal transport systems in serum . However , is it involved in their incorporation into cells ? To partly answer this question , we analyzed , in vitro and in the presence or absence of CHAPS micelles , the interaction of the metal - loaded transferrins with the full non - cleaved receptor 1 . Henceforth and for reasons of simplicity , we shall only refer to the receptor 1 subunit ( TFR ) . CHAPS micelles play the role of arti ﬁ cial membranes that solubilize the trans - membrane domain of the receptor and allow its monodisperse presence in the medium in a non - aggregated fashion [ 3 , 4 , 10 – 14 , 71 ] . The following analysis is based on two different approaches : 1 ) thermodynamics and 2 ) kinetics . 3 . 1 . Thermodynamicsofprotein / proteininteractionbetweeniron - saturated transferrin and receptor 1 In neutral media , receptor 1 exists as two prototropic species ( Eq . ( 41 ) ) with a K a of 10 nM [ 13 ] . TFR + H þ ⇌ TFRH K a = TFR ½ (cid:2) H þ (cid:4) (cid:5) = TFRH ½ (cid:2) ð 41 Þ Spectrophotometric titration monitored by ﬂ uorescence emission showed that TFR interacts with TFe 2 and not with T . The overall dissociation constant involved in this protein / protein adduct was measured in neutral media ( Eq . ( 42 ) ) . It showed a very strong interaction between the two proteins ( K d2 = 2 . 3 nM ) [ 4 ] . TFR + TFe 2 ⇌ un − identified steps ⇌ TFRTFe 2 ð 42 Þ with K d2 = [ TFR ] [ TFe 2 ] / [ TFRTFe 2 ] . These results were acquired at the ﬁ nal equilibrated state and do not give any information about the mechanism of the interactions between TFe 2 , and the receptor . A kinetic investigation was therefore , undertaken . 3 . 2 . Kinetics of protein / protein interaction between iron - loaded transferrin and receptor1 When a solution of TFe 2 and TFR solubilized by CHAPS micelles is submitted to a fast T - jump from 25 to about 37 °C , two very fast kinetic processes are observed . The ﬁ rst occurs in less than 1 μ s and corresponds to the interaction of the receptor with the CHAPS micelles . It is followed by another process occurring in the tens of μ s range , which corresponds to an interaction between the receptor and TFe 2 . This process is followed by a very slow phenomenon ( about 2 h ) , during which the protein / protein adduct attains its thermodynamic equilibrated state ( Figs . 7 , 8 ) . The ﬁ rst process is not observed in the absence of the CHAPS micelles , whereas the second and third are still detected with , however , a low signal - to - noise ratio . The fastest process detected is , therefore , ascribed to the dissociation of the CHAPS micelles , which does not interfere with the forthcoming kinetic events [ 13 ] . Subsequently , the interaction of TFe 2 with TFR occurs in two sequential steps : I ) a very fast process , which leads to a kinetic intermediate protein / protein adduct with a dissociation constant , K d1 of 0 . 5 μ M , II ) a slow conformational change of the intermediate , which produces the thermodynamic TFRTFe 2 complex ( Fig . 7 ) . This process stabilizes the protein / protein adduct by a factor of about 300 and leads to the overall K d2 of 2 . 3 nM reported above [ 13 ] . Cheng et al . showed that the interaction of the C - lobe of TFe 2 is strong , and occurs with the helical domain of the receptor , whereas that of the N - lobe is weak , and occurs in the cavity formed between the protease - like domain and the plasma membrane [ 21 ] . The ﬁ rst strong interaction depicted by the fast kinetic process is , thus , related to the interaction of the C - lobe of TFe 2 with the helical domain of TFR , whereas the second slow and weak interaction is due to a conformation change allowing the N - lobe to interact with the protease - like domain ( Figs . 7 and 8 , Table 3 , Eqs . ( 43 ) , ( 44 ) ) [ 14 , 16 ] . 3 . 3 . The case of aluminum , bismuth , gallium , cobalt and uranium In vitro , no interaction between TAl 2 and TFR is detected . This , however , does not imply its absence . It only indicates that this interaction is either much too weak to be detected by ﬂ uorescence emission , or that it does not lead to suf ﬁ cient variation in the emission spectra to allow detection [ 4 ] . TBi 2 , TGa 2 , TCo 2 and TUr 2 interact with TFR [ 3 , 47 ] . However , these interactions are not always similar to those reported for iron . Indeed , the overall dissociation constants involved vary from 2 . 3 nM for iron , to 6 μ M for uranyl and is undetected for aluminum ( Table 3 ) [ 3 , 4 , 12 ] . Furthermore , the mechanisms of interactions between the metal - loaded transferrin and TFR can differ from those reported for TFe 2 . Indeed , TBi 2 and TGa 2 interact with TFR in a single kinetic step similar to that attributed to the interaction of the C - lobe of TFe 2 with the helical domain , with no second step related to the interaction of the N - lobe with the protease - like domain . The rate constants and half - lives involved also differ considerably ( about 20 μ s for TFe 2 , up to 15 ms for TUr 2 ; Fig . 8 , Table 3 ) [ 10 – 12 , 14 ] . Conversely , the behavior of TCo 2 is similar to that of iron with a fast 341 J . - M .

With TUr 2 , the two interactions with the C - and N - lobes are fast ( Figs . 8B and 8D ) [ 12 ] . 4 . Metal - loaded transferrins and internalization by the iron acquisition pathway Table 3 clearly shows that the overall af ﬁ nities of metal - loaded transferrins for the receptor as compared to that of TFe 2 are weak to very weak . Apart from TCo 2 , this excludes any possible competition between the metal - loaded transferrins and TFe 2 for TFR . However , endocytosis occurs in the minute range [ 72 ] . This process is much faster than the interaction of the N - lobe with TFR , which occurs in the hour range , and much slower than that of the C - lobe with TFR , which occurs in the tens of μ s range with TCo 2 to the ms range with TUr 2 [ 11 , 47 ] . Although in the early nineties , experiments performed with rabbit reticulocytes and iron - loaded transferrins led to assume that the af ﬁ nities of both lobes to the receptor are almost identical [ 73 ] , it was recently shown that , transferrin in which only the C - lobe is metal - loaded interacts strongly and rapidly with the receptor [ 3 , 4 , 21 ] . This implies that metal - loaded transferrins are most probably internalized by endocytosis with mainly their C - lobe interacting with TFR . Surface plasmon resonance was used to obtain kineticand thermodynamicdatarelatedtotheinteractionofTFe 2 andthe hemochromatosis protein HFE with the soluble ectodomain of the receptor ( Table 3 ) and a series of its mutants . It was shown that despite a lower af ﬁ nity for the ectodomain than TFe 2 , HFE blocks the interaction of the latter with the receptor [ 74 , 75 ] . Although our experiments were performed with the complete non - cleaved receptor and by means of the chemical relaxation techniques , it is still possible to compare the mechanisms of these protein / protein interactions . Indeed , TFe 2 interacts with both the helical and the protease - like domains [ 3 , 21 ] , and the overall af ﬁ nity of holotransferrin for receptor 1 is about ﬁ fty times that of HFE ( Table 3 ) [ 21 , 75 ] . However , the af ﬁ nity of the C - lobe for TFR is about ﬁ fty times lower than that of HFE [ 3 , 4 , 21 ] . Both interactions are instantaneous as compared to that of the N - lobe of TFe 2 with TFR and to endocytosis [ 3 ] . Therefore , although the competition between both HFE and TFe 2 for TFR is thermodynamically largely in favor of TFe 2 , the interactionofHFEwiththehelicaldomainofTFRis , withinthetimerange of endocytosis , much more favored than that of the C - lobe of TFe 2 . It can , therefore , perturb the acquisition of iron by receptor - mediated endocy - tosis . The same reasoning can apply for TCo 2 , TBi 2 , TGa 2 and TUr 2 , where the overall af ﬁ nity for TFR is lower than that of TFe 2 ( Table 3 ) .

With TUr 2 , both interactions of the C - and N - lobes occur within the life span of endocytosis , which implies a possible internalization of TUr 2 with both lobes interacting with TFR . However , this last case implies a high concentration of Ur in the serum , which can only be achieved under conditions ofseverecontamination ( exposuretouraniumusedforcivilor military purposes ) [ 47 , 76 , 77 ] . As interesting as these results may be , they cannot imply that the incorporation of these metals can follow the iron acquisition pathway . Indeed , in order to do so , the metal should ﬁ rst , be released from the protein / protein adduct in the acidic medium of the endosome . 5 . Metal release from transferrin in interaction with receptor 1 in media close to those of the endosome In acidic media , transferrin receptor 1 exists in an acidic form TFR a [ 13 , 78 ] . TFR a is also present in the mildly acidic medium ( pH b 6 ) of the endosome as two prototropic species ( Eq . ( 53 ) ) with a protodissociation pK 1a of 5 . 6 [ 13 ] .

( B ) The second isalso an increase inemission , describingiron loss from the C - lobe upon interaction withthe receptor . ( C ) The third appears as a slow decrease in emission ( about 20 min ) during which an equilibrium is achieved between the free acidic form of the receptor and that upon interaction with apotransferrin . All kinetic runs were recorded with λ ex = 280 nm for λ em N 300 nm at 37 °C and μ = 0 . 2 [ 13 , 16 ] . 344 J . - M . El Hage Chahine et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 334 – 347 An interaction occurs between apotransferrin T and TFR a . This interaction is rate - controlled by a slow ( about 20 min ) conformational change in TFR a and occurs with an overall dissociation constant , K 1D = 36 nM ( Table 4 , Eq . ( 54 ) , ( 55 ) ) [ 13 ] . TFR a ⇌ TFR ’ a rate − limiting ð Þ ð 54 Þ TFR ’ a + TH 6 ⇌ TFR a − TH 6 ð 55 Þ with K 1D = [ TFR a ] [ TH 6 ] / [ TFR a TH 6 ] and TH 6 , apotransferrin with all protein ligands in the protonated state . When a neutral solution of TFe 2 interacting with TFR is mixed with a mildly acidic buffer to reach a ﬁ nal pH of 4 . 5 to 6 , three kinetic processes are detected by ﬂ uorescence emission ( Fig . 9 ) [ 16 ] . The ﬁ rst occurs in 0 . 1 to 0 . 5 s and corresponds to iron release from the N - lobe interacting with the protease - like domain and is rate - controlled by a conformational change triggered by a proton gain . The second process corresponds to iron loss from the C - lobe upon interaction with the helical domain . It is rate - controlled by another conformation change , triggered , by another proton gain , and ﬁ nally the equilibrium depicted by Eqs . ( 54 ) and ( 55 ) is attained ( Table 4 ) [ 16 ] . Compared to iron loss in the absence of TFR , the interaction with the receptor accelerates iron release in acidic media , even in the absence of a competing ligand such as citrate [ 16 , 65 , 79 ] . During these processes , TFe 2 interacting with TFR undergoes proton - triggered conformational changes , during which each lobe transits from its closed to open conformation by a proton - induced unzipping effect [ 16 , 65 , 79 ] . The ﬁ rst step in this unzipping is proton - assisted decarbonation of the N - lobe - binding cleft and then protonation of the aminoacids engaged at the lips of the cleft , which breaks the interdomain hydrogen - bonds and opens the binding cavity to the bulk medium [ 65 ] . This is followed by sequential protonation of the protein ligands , which successively breaks each coordination bond , ﬁ nally releasing the metal and allowing the lobe to adopt the open structure . The overall proton gain during iron loss at pH 4 . 5 to 6 is 3 protons per binding site , with an average pK a value of 5 . 3 for the N - lobe and 5 . 1 for the C - lobe ( Table 4 , Fig . 10 ) [ 16 ] . After losing iron in the endosome , T remains interacting with the acidic form of the receptor and is recycled to the plasma membrane ( Table 4 ) [ 16 ] . These results were reported for the non - cleaved transferrin receptor , the transmembrane part of which was solubi - lized by CHAPS micelles [ 16 ] . They are , however , at variance with recent results acquired with the soluble ectodomain of the receptor [ 80 ] . Nonetheless , in both approaches , it is estimated that iron is released in the endosome in about 2 min . This is short compared to the endocytic cycle that takes several minutes [ 16 , 80 ] . 6 . Metal release in the endosome and incorporation by the cell The structures of the cobalt - and gallium - loaded transferrins seem to be quite close to that of holotransferrin [ 10 , 11 , 59 , 64 , 69 , 70 ] . In this case metal loss from TGa 2 and TCo 2 would occur by mechanisms similar to those reported in Table 4 . However , with normal transferrin , TAl 2 does not seem to interact with the receptor [ 4 ] , which was explained by the partly open structure of the binding clefts in each of the two lobes [ 69 ] . This reduced af ﬁ nity of T for the metal and that of the metal - loaded transferrin for the receptor was also reported in the case of some abnormal human transferrins [ 81 ] . As for TBi 2 and TUr 2 , they also appear to be in a semi - open structure where the metal cation is not completely enclosed in the binding cleft and is partly exposed to the bulk medium [ 59 , 64 , 70 ] . This can probably facilitate their release in the endosome . It does not , nevertheless , imply their incorporation by the iron acquisition pathway , because in order to do so , several other steps are still required . Indeed , iron is transported from the endosome to the cytosol in the + 2 oxidation state by divalent metal transport systems , such as DMT1 [ 8 , 82 ] . This iron reduction may occur after or before iron release [ 83 – 85 ] . However , U ( VI ) , Bi ( III ) and Ga ( III ) do not normally exist in the + 2 oxidation state [ 70 , 86 , 87 ] . Does this imply their recycling back to the plasma membrane after completion of the iron delivery cycle by endocytosis ? Or can they be delivered to the cytosol by means other than reduction and active transport through the membrane of the endosome ? 7 . Conclusion Several metals form stable complexes with transferrin . Some of these metal - loaded transferrins are recognized by receptor 1 with , however , lower af ﬁ nities than that of TFe 2 . Nonetheless , in iron delivery by the transferrin receptor - mediated iron acquisition pathway , the essential step is the interaction of the C - lobe of the metal - loaded T with the helical domain of the receptor . Indeed , this Fig . 10 . The mechanism of iron transport from the blood serum to cytosol : the C - lobe of holotransferrin interacts instantaneously ( 50 μ s ) with the helical domain of the receptor , whereas the interaction of the N - lobe is very slow ( 2 h ) . Statistically , transferrin will thus be internalized mainly with the C - lobe interacting with the receptor . After acidi ﬁ cation of theendosome , ironisreleasedinthecytosolwithinseconds . Thisreleaseismuchfasterthanendocytosis . Invitro , apotransferrinispartlyreleasedfromtheproteinadductformedby its interaction with acidic form of the receptor within 20 min , which is longer than the recycling time of the endosome to the cell surface . This implies the recycling of a transferrin mainlyininteractionwiththeacidicreceptor .

El Hage Chahine et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 334 – 347 interaction is instantaneous , strong and much faster than endocytosis . On the other hand , the interaction of the N - lobe of the protein with the protease - like domain of the receptor is weak or nonexistent and much slower than endocytosis . It is therefore not much involved in the internalization process . This implies that metal - loaded trans - ferrins such as TCo 2 , TBi 2 , TUr 2 and TGa 2 or other proteins such as HFE , which possess lower overall af ﬁ nities for receptor 1 than TFe 2 , but comparable or higher af ﬁ nities than TFe 2 for the helical domain of receptor 1 can compete with TFe 2 and possibly be internalized by receptor - mediated endocytosis . This , however , does not imply that their incorporation necessarily takes place by the iron acquisition pathway , because iron is transported from the endosome to the cytosol by a divalent metal transporter in the 2 + oxidation sate . Beside iron , only cobalt can achieve such a goal . References [ 1 ] W . R . Harris , Equilibrium constants for the complexation of metal ions by serum transferrin , Adv . Exp . Med .
