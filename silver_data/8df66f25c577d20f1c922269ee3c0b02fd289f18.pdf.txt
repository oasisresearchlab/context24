Field * Department of Biological Sciences , Imperial College , Exhibition Road , London SW7 2AY , United Kingdom Received 7 December 2004 / Accepted 16 March 2005 In Trypanosoma brucei , endocytosis is developmentally regulated and is substantially more active in the mammalian infective stage , where it likely plays a role in immune evasion . The small GTPase TbRAB11 is highly expressed in the mammalian stage and mediates recycling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins , including the variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) and the transferrin receptor , plus trafﬁcking of internalized anti - VSG antibody and transferrin . No function has been assigned to TbRAB11 in the procyclic ( insect ) stage trypanosome . The importance of TbRAB11 to both bloodstream and procyclic form viability was assessed by RNA interference ( RNAi ) . Suppression of TbRAB11 in the bloodstream form was rapidly lethal and led to cells with round morphology and an enlarged ﬂagellar pocket . TbRAB11 RNAi was also lethal in procyclic forms , which also became rounded , but progression to cell death was signiﬁcantly slower and the ﬂagellar pocket remained normal . In bloodstream forms , silencing of TbRAB11 had no effect on exocytosis of newly synthesized VSG , ﬂuid - phase endocytosis , or transferrin uptake , but export of internalized transferrin was inhibited . Lectin endocytosis assays revealed a block to postendosomal transport mediated by suppressing TbRAB11 . By contrast , in procyclic forms , depletion of TbRAB11 blocks both ﬂuid - phase endocytosis and internalization of surface proteins . In normal bloodstream forms , most VSG is recycled , but in procyclics , internalized surface proteins accumulated in the lysosome . These data demonstrate that TbRAB11 controls recycling and is essential in both life stages of T . brucei but that its primary role is subject to developmental variation . Endocytosis and recycling of plasma membrane components are regulated by small GTPases of the Rab family ( 42 ) . Mam - malian Rab11 is predominantly located in the perinuclear re - cycling compartment and controls recycling of a range of re - ceptors ( 9 , 16 , 19 , 26 , 27 , 36 , 37 ) . Recycling of plasma membrane glycosphingolipids is also dependent on Rab11 ( 35 ) . The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of mammalian Rab11 , Ypt3p , is essential for growth and regulates multiple stages in the exocytic pathway ( 5 ) . There is also evidence for a role for Rab11 in secretory exocytosis in mammalian cells ( 4 ) . In addition , Rab11 is implicated in transcytosis in polarized epithelia , in endosome - to - trans - Golgi network trafﬁcking , and in actin remodeling during cellularization in Drosophila mela - nogaster embryogenesis ( 34 , 39 , 40 ) . The ability of Rab11 to control such diverse cellular processes depends on the speciﬁc interactions of the active GTPase with a number of different binding proteins that allow association with distinct vesicular populations and domains . Several such proteins have been identiﬁed , including the Rab - 11FIP family , RAB11B / Rabphi - lin - 11 , myosin VB , PI4K " , and Sec15p , each of which appears to be associated with distinct aspects of Rab11 function ( 6 , 13 , 22 , 24 , 38 , 43 ) . Trypanosoma brucei , the protozoan parasite responsible for human African sleeping sickness , exists in biochemically and morphologically distinct forms in the mammalian and insect vector hosts . In both life stages , vesicle trafﬁcking to and from the surface is limited to the ﬂagellar pocket , a specialized invagination at the base of the ﬂagellum ( 29 ) . However , rates of endocytosis in the bloodstream form ( BSF ) and procyclic form ( PCF ) are vastly different . For example , endocytic recy - cling of the variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) in BSF is very rapid , and the entire ﬂagellar pocket is internalized within # 2 min ( 8 ) . In contrast , uptake in procyclic cells is unusually slow , with little turnover of surface proteins ( 23 ) . Differentiation between BSF and PCF stages is accompanied by changes to the expression levels of a number of proteins regulating endocy - tosis and recycling , including clathrin and the T . brucei ortho - logue of mammalian Rab11 , TbRAB11 ( 17 , 28 ) . Recent work to elucidate the ﬁner molecular details of the BSF endomembrane system has demonstrated that TbRAB11 is an important factor ( 12 ) . Receptor - mediated endocytosis , internalization of surface VSG , and ﬂuid - phase uptake are all clathrin mediated ( 1 , 12 ) . The absence of both an AP - 2 adaptin complex and cargo sorting is apparent at the point of entry , but after fusion with TbRAB5A - positive early endosomes , VSG is negatively selected in a second clathrin - dependent step and is rapidly returned to the plasma membrane via TbRAB11 - pos - itive structures ( 12 ) . A proportion of VSG is trafﬁcked to the late endosome , but this is also recycled to the surface by TbRAB11 ( 8 ) . Like VSG , internalized anti - VSG immuno - globulins and transferrin are transported to a TbRAB5A com - partment and thereafter degraded and recycled in a TbRAB11 - dependent manner ( 32 , 33 ) .

The endocytic system of the PCF stage is less well charac - terized . The PCF has a distinct surface coat that is composed of further glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored pro - teins , called procyclins , but lacks VSG . As in BSFs , endocytosis is clathrin dependent , and internalized cargo ﬁrst enters a TbRAB5A compartment , but the endosomal compartments in the PCF are less complex than in the BSF . TbRAB5A and the related TbRAB5B , which occupy distinct domains in BSF , colocalize in the PCF ( 32 ) , and the clathrin - coated vesicles responsible for sorting of VSG from other cargo have not been described for PCF . Recycling of surface proteins has been reported ( 23 ) , but the role of TbRAB11 , which is down - regu - lated in this stage , is unknown ( 17 ) . Here we show that TbRAB11 is essential to both major trypanosome life stages and also appears to have distinct roles . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture . The BSF line T . brucei BSF90 - 13 Lister 427 was maintained in HMI - 9 medium supplemented with 10 % tetracycline - free fetal bovine serum ( Autogen Bioclear ) in the continuous presence of 5 $ g ml % 1 hygromycin B ( Sigma ) and 2 . 5 $ g ml % 1 Geneticin ( Sigma ) to maintain the T7 - responsive phenotype ( 41 ) . Tetracycline - responsive PTT cells , derived from strain 427 pro - cyclic cells ( a kind gift from Phillipe Bastin ) , were maintained in SDM - 79 me - dium supplemented with 10 % tetracycline - free fetal bovine serum and 7 . 5 $ g ml % 1 hemin in the presence of 25 $ g ml % 1 each of hygromycin B and Geneticin .

Biotin was detected with Texas Red - conjugated streptavidin ( Vectalabs ) . For quantiﬁcation , images were taken under identical , nonsaturating conditions . Transferrin endocytosis and recycling . Bovine holo - transferrin ( Sigma ) was iodinated with iodine - 125 ( Amersham Biosciences ) by using IodoBeads reagent ( Pierce ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Assays were carried out as described previously ( 14 ) . Brieﬂy , the expression of double - stranded RNA cor - responding to TbRAB11 in p2T7Ti - TbRAB11 cells was induced for 16 to 18 h with 1 $ g ml % 1 tetracycline . Cells were washed twice with SF / HMI - 9 . Washed cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min at a concentration of 1 & 10 7 to 2 & 10 7 cells ml % 1 , and then 125 I - labeled transferrin was added ( typically # 2 $ g at a speciﬁc activity of 3 & 10 6 cpm $ g % 1 ) . Triplicate 500 - $ l samples of cells were incubated at 4 or 37°C for various times . Nonspeciﬁc binding controls included cold transferrin at a concentration of 600 $ g ml % 1 . Accumulation was stopped by the addition of 500 $ l of cold SF / HMI - 9 containing 600 $ g ml % 1 transferrin . Cells were washed three times in ice - cold PBS – 0 . 05 % BSA and resuspended in 200 $ l PBS . Accumulation of 125 I was measured with a ’ - counter ( Beckman Coulter ) . For the recycling of transferrin degradative products , cells were pulsed for 40 min with transferrin , washed in PBS - BSA as described above , and then resuspended to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 & 10 7 cells ml % 1 in complete HMI - 9 . Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 or 4°C and then centrifuged for 1 min at 13 , 000 & g at 4°C . Radioactivity in supernatants and pellets was determined as described above . VSG export assay . Export was monitored as described previously ( 1 ) . Brieﬂy , 5 & 10 7 mid - log - phase BSF cells were washed once in labeling medium ( Met / Cys - free Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium [ Sigma ] supplemented with 10 % dialyzed fetal calf serum and HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) , resuspended in 1 ml labeling medium , and incubated at 37°C for 15 min . The cells were pulse - labeled at 37°C for 7 min with Promix at a concentration of 200 $ Ci / ml , then diluted 1 : 10 with prewarmed complete HMI - 9 , and chased for up to 1 h at 37°C . At intervals during the chase , aliquots of cells were removed from the sample and placed on ice . Following centrifugation in a microcentrifuge ( 20 , 000 & g at 4°C ) , cell pellets were washed once in 1 ml ice - cold PBS – 1 mg / ml BSA and resuspended in 920 $ l of hypotonic lysis buffer ( 1 ) . After 5 min on ice , the lysates were incubated at 37°C for 10 min to enable GPI - speciﬁc phospholipase C to convert susceptible membrane - form VSG to soluble VSG . Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 972 HALL ET AL . E UKARYOT . C ELL 20 , 000 & g at 4°C , and 900 $ l of supernatant was retained . The pellet fraction was washed in ice - cold hypotonic lysis buffer , resuspended in 1 ml ice - cold sample lysis buffer ( 1 ) , and incubated on ice for 25 min .

After being washed , samples were resuspended in sample buffer and loaded onto SDS – 10 % PAGE gels at 10 5 cell equivalents per lane . Fixed , stained gels were treated for 1 h with En 3 Hance ( Perkin - Elmer ) and autoradiographed . Image intensity was quantiﬁed using NIH Image . RESULTS TbRAB11 is essential in both bloodstream and procyclic form trypanosomes . Induction of expression of double - stranded TbRAB11 RNA leads to an immediate cessation of growth in the BSF , paralleled by a loss of expression of the TbRAB11 protein ( Fig . 1A and B ) . By phase - contrast micros - copy , abnormally shortened cells began to appear within a few hours of induction . Cells became progressively more rounded with time , and an enlarged vacuole became visible after # 18 h FIG . 1 . TbRAB11 is essential in BSF T . brucei .

( B ) Western blot analysis of TbRAB11 protein expression levels . p2T7Ti - TbRAB11 BSF cells were incubated in the presence of 1 $ g ml % 1 tetracycline for 0 , 4 , 18 , and 24 h before the harvesting and separating of proteins by SDS - PAGE .

At least 100 cells were counted for each time point . Abnormal is deﬁned as any change in cell shape , from shortening of the cell body to complete rounding of the cell . Note that ﬂagellar pocket enlargement occurs after the appearance of abnormal cells . V OL . 4 , 2005 DEVELOPMENTAL VARIATION IN TRYPANOSOME Rab11 FUNCTION 973 ( Fig . 1C ) . To identify the large vacuole , the ultrastructure of TbRAB11 RNAi cells was analyzed by electron microscopy ( Fig . 1D ) . The presence of a ﬂagellum clearly identiﬁes the swollen structure that takes up most of the cell body as the ﬂagellar pocket . Although the morphological phenotype trig - gered by TbRAB11 loss is superﬁcially similar to the BigEye phenotype characteristically induced by a block in endocytosis ( 1 , 15 ) , the kinetics are distinct . RNAi of clathrin leads to an increase in the size of the ﬂagellar pocket as the ﬁrst morpho - logically detectable feature ( 1 ) , but for TbRAB11 suppression , cell rounding precedes ﬂagellar pocket enlargement and only a small proportion of cells retain normal cell shape ( Fig . 1E ) . Hence , in this case , ﬂagellar pocket enlargement is probably a secondary effect , presumably due to overall imbalance in traf - ﬁcking at the plasma membrane . Analysis of DAPI ( 4 ) , 6 ) - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) - stained cells revealed similar kine - toplast - to - nucleus ratios and copy numbers in both induced and uninduced cells , suggesting that growth arrest was not associated with a speciﬁc block in the cell cycle ( data not shown ) . In the PCF , TbRAB11 is expressed at much lower levels than in the BSF ( 17 ) , and the effects of TbRAB11 depletion in this life stage were both less immediate and less dramatic than for BSFs . Partial growth inhibition was detectable 2 days postinduction , but complete inhibition of cell division was ob - tained only after 3 days of induction ( Fig . 2A ) . A marked decrease in TbRAB11 protein was detected after only 28 h and prior to a signiﬁcant growth defect ( Fig . 2B ) , suggesting that the PCF is tolerant of reduced TbRAB11 levels . However , similar to the BSF cells , PCF cells become gradually more round ( Fig . 2C ) . At 4 days , approximately 75 % of cells retain normal morphology despite complete inhibition of growth . By electron microscopy , the intracellular morphology of the PCFs 3 days after the addition of tetracycline is apparently normal , even in rounded cells , with no increase in the size of the ﬂagellar pocket ( Fig . 2D ) . Thus , as well as a slower response to the loss of TbRAB11 , PCF cells exhibit much less severe ul - trastructural defects than BSF cells . However , the inhibition of growth in both BSF and PCF cells demonstrates that TbRAB11 expression is essential for both of the major prolif - erative life stages of T . brucei . TbRAB11 is necessary for recycling transferrin and delivery of endocytosed cargo to the lysosome in the BSF but is not required for early stages of endocytosis . TbRAB11 compart - ments are associated with internalized surface proteins , and biotinylated VSG recycling from the early and late endosomes is consistently found in TbRAB11 - positive vesicles ( 12 , 17 ) . Indirect analyses of turnover of ﬂuorescent transferrin and anti - VSG antibodies also suggest that TbRAB11 is involved in recycling ( 33 ) , but no direct measurements have been made to date . To conﬁrm the role of TbRAB11 in the endocytic path - way , bulk uptake and recycling of radiolabeled transferrin were assayed in BSF TbRAB11 RNAi cells . TbRAB11 expression was not required for endocytosis of transferrin , but recycling of the internalized protein was reduced by approximately 80 % ( Fig . 3A ) . This was unexpected , since inhibition of transferrin receptor recycling should lead to a gradual inhibition of uptake , and recent reports have suggested that inhibition of TbRAB11 leads to a relocalization of the transferrin receptor from the FIG . 2 .

V OL . 4 , 2005 DEVELOPMENTAL VARIATION IN TRYPANOSOME Rab11 FUNCTION 975 ﬂagellar pocket to intracellular sites ( 31 ) . However , the T . brucei BSF can compensate for a reduction in iron availability with increased expression of the transferrin receptor ESAG6 / 7 ( 10 ) . To investigate whether TbRAB11 RNAi induction alters transferrin receptor expression , whole - cell lysates were pre - pared at different times of exposure to tetracycline . By West - ern blotting , the total level of the ESAG7 subunit of the re - ceptor increased with time in induced cells ( Fig . 3B ) . A similar increase was observed in ESAG6 expression ( data not shown ) . No change was seen in TbBiP or in total VSG levels ( data not shown ) , indicating that the increase in ESAG6 / 7 expression was speciﬁc . Thus , a balance between synthesis and degrada - tion of the receptor may allow transferrin uptake to be main - tained at a constant level even in a background where endo - cytic ﬂux is reduced , consistent with previous data that show that these proteins are tightly regulated by iron availability . It is unclear what happens to the internalized transferrin , but it is possible that cargo and receptor accumulate in similar internal sites . Overall , these data indicate a decrease in the ﬂux of receptor - mediated endocytosis in TbRAB11 - suppressed cells . The pathway for transport of ﬂuid - phase cargo in the T . brucei BSF is distinct from that taken by GPI - anchored pro - teins . Fluorescent dextran separates from surface proteins very rapidly following entry into the cell . While most VSG is recy - cled directly or via the late endosome ( 8 ) , ﬂuid - phase trafﬁc is accumulated in the lysosome in a process regulated by TbRAB4 ( 14 ) . Based on current understanding , changes to TbRAB11 expression would therefore be predicted to have little impact on ﬂuid - phase transport in the BSF , and this is indeed the case ( Fig . 3C and D ) . Although a reduction in uptake of Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled dextran can be seen in the most severely deformed cells ( Fig . 3C , arrows ) , most parasites accumulate dextran normally when TbRAB11 is depleted and no signiﬁcant change in mean ﬂuorescence is detectable ( Fig . 3D ) . To analyze the fate of endocytosed cargo , trafﬁcking of in - ternalized material was monitored by allowing cells to take up FITC - labeled ConA and then costaining for clathrin or the lysosomal marker p67 ( Fig . 3E ) . On entry into the cell , ConA is initially transported via clathrin - coated vesicles to the TbRAB5A - positive early endosome and thence to the lyso - some ( 1 , 3 , 17 ) . In both uninduced and induced TbRAB11 RNAi cells , there is little overlap between FITC - ConA and clathrin after 30 min , indicating that trafﬁcking to the early endosome does not require TbRAB11 . However , transport to the lysosome is affected by TbRAB11 suppression . While the majority of ConA is located within the p67 compartment in uninduced cells , FITC - ConA and anti - p67 labeling are distinct in induced cells . Quantitation of the degree of colocalization conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant decrease in ConA trafﬁcking to the lysosome ( P + 0 . 001 ) . TbRAB11 is not required for exocytosis of newly synthesized VSG . Both Ypt3p , the yeast orthologue of TbRAB11 , and mammalian Rab11 function in the exocytic pathway ( 4 , 5 ) . Immunoelectron microscopy has failed to identify TbRAB11 - negative exocytic vesicles carrying VSG , raising the possibility that TbRAB11 mediates the export of both newly synthesized and recycled VSG ( 31 ) . However , as biosynthetic VSG repre - sents only a small proportion of total intracellular VSG , exo - cytic VSG vesicles may have been overlooked by morphologi - cal analysis . To determine whether TbRAB11 has a role in the exocytosis of newly synthesized proteins , the rate of transport of 35 S - labeled VSG from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface was monitored ( 1 , 7 ) . In uninduced cells , VSG reaches the surface with a half time of approximately 9 min . Neither the rate of transport nor the proportion of VSG recovered in the supernatant was altered by suppression of TbRAB11 ( Fig . 4 ) . By contrast , suppressing either TbRAB1 or TbRAB2 , pro - teins regulating endoplasmic reticulum - to - Golgi and intra - Golgi transport , leads to a signiﬁcant decrease in the rate of VSG exocytosis ( 7 ) . These data therefore indicate that TbRAB11 is unlikely to be a key component of the biosynthetic VSG exocytic pathway . TbRAB11 RNAi blocks endocytosis in procyclics . The role of TbRAB11 in PCF endocytic trafﬁcking was assessed by moni - toring uptake of ﬂuorescent dextran . In contrast to the lack of effect on ﬂuid - phase transport in the BSF , transport of dextran was inhibited in procyclics by TbRAB11 suppression ( Fig . 5A and B ) . This suggests that control of ﬂuid - phase trafﬁcking is different for the two life stages and that TbRAB11 may have distinct roles in PCF and BSF cells . To determine whether the loss of TbRAB11 also affected the internalization of plasma membrane proteins , the cell surface was labeled with cleavable biotin and cells were incubated for various times . Remaining external label was stripped with glutathione and internal biotin detected with Texas Red - labeled streptavidin . Unstripped cells showed staining of the entire surface , with the strongest signal on the ﬂagellum and in the ﬂagellar pocket , a pattern similar to that obtained by staining with FITC - labeled ConA , and no difference in intensity could be detected between TbRAB11 RNAi and control cells ( data not shown ) . A low level of biotin FIG . 4 . TbRAB11 is not required for export of newly synthesized VSG . Export of VSG in uninduced ( open squares ) and 18 h induced ( ﬁlled squares ) p2T7Ti - TbRAB11 BSF cells was monitored by recov - ery of GPI - speciﬁc phospholipase C - hydrolyzed soluble VSG from supernatants of hypotonic lysates taken at different time points follow - ing pulse labeling with [ 35 S ] methionine ( 1 ) . Soluble VSG was quanti - ﬁed by densitometric analysis of labeled bands on autoradiograms using NIH Image software . Results are presented as percentages of total recovered VSG in the supernatant after background subtraction . Each time point shows the mean of duplicate experiments ( the range . 976 HALL ET AL . E UKARYOT . C ELL was seen in cells incubated at 4°C that appeared to be re - stricted to the ﬂagellar pocket ( Fig . 5C ) . In cells incubated at 28°C for 30 min , internalized biotin was detected in endosomal compartments . Intracellular biotin levels increased over time in both induced and uninduced cells , but , as seen for ﬂuid - phase trafﬁcking , levels of ﬂuorescence were consistently re - duced in cells lacking TbRAB11 expression ( Fig . 5C and D ) . Thus , TbRAB11 loss leads to a reduction in both ﬂuid - phase and membrane protein endocytic activity in the PCF . Internalized surface protein and ﬂuid - phase cargo both ac - cumulate in the lysosome in PCF parasites . As in the BSF , the surface coat of the PCF is predominantly made up of GPI - anchored proteins , so the distinct patterns of ﬂuid - phase and membrane protein transport in PCF and BSF TbRAB11 RNAi cannot be attributed to differential trafﬁcking of GPI - versus non - GPI - anchored proteins . In the BSF , biotinylated VSG and ﬂuid - phase cargo become rapidly separated , and at steady state only approximately 20 % of endocytosed VSG colocalizes with dextran ( 8 ) . TbRAB11 RNAi has similar effects on both ﬂuid - phase uptake and internalization of surface protein in the PCF , suggesting that these cells may not segregate cargo to the same degree as BSFs . To investigate the relationships between ﬂuid - phase and surface protein trafﬁcking pathways , procyclic cells were labeled with both biotin and Alexa 488 dextran . After 1 h , internalized biotin and dextran were almost completely colo - calized ( Fig . 6A ) . Quantitation indicates colocalization of FIG . 5 .

In the normal BSF , ﬂuid - phase cargo is trafﬁcked to the lysosome ( 8 , 14 ) . To determine whether the inhibition seen by TbRAB11 suppression was due to effects on the lysosome , induced and uninduced cells were stained with antibody to p67 ( Fig . 6B ) . Loss of TbRAB11 expression led to an increase in intensity of staining of the PCF p67 compartment . The in - creased staining suggests enhanced p67 synthesis and trafﬁck - ing , inhibition of trafﬁcking at a postlysosomal step , or a gen - eral rerouting of material that would otherwise be recycled towards the lysosome . In order to distinguish between these possibilities , PCF cells were costained for internalized biotin and p67 ( Fig . 6C ) . For the purposes of colocalization , images were captured under limiting conditions to minimize signal crossover , which explains the reduced level of p67 staining in the induced cells . In the BSF , very little internalized VSG is found in the lysosomal compartment ( 8 ) , but in both unin - duced and induced procyclic cells , the bulk of the internalized biotin label colocalized with p67 . The proportion of internal - ized label found in the lysosomal compartment was unchanged ( 76 . 1 % ( 2 . 6 % for induced cells and 79 . 7 % ( 3 . 3 % for unin - duced cells ) . Taken together , the results show in PCF trypano - somes most endocytic cargo is directed to the lysosome . DISCUSSION Endocytosis is developmentally regulated in T . brucei and affects both nutrient uptake and drug sensitivity ( 29 ) . In addi - tion , VSG in BSF parasites is efﬁciently recycled in a process that also removes bound immune effectors , suggesting an im - portant role in immune evasion . Studies in this laboratory and others have implicated TbRAB11 in the recycling of VSG and the transferrin receptor as well as the export of degraded anti - VSG antibody and transferrin ( 12 , 33 ) . Maintenance of the uptake arm of the endocytic system is essential to the survival of T . brucei ( 1 , 15 ) , but the importance of the recycling step to cell viability has not been established . Here we have demonstrated that both mammal - and insect - infective T . brucei cells require TbRAB11 function for contin - ued cellular survival , but ablation of TbRAB11 expression re - veals distinct properties in the two cell types . First , loss of TbRAB11 expression in the BSF is rapidly lethal and induces a shortened and progressively rounded morphology . Prolonged induction of TbRAB11 RNAi leads to an enlarged ﬂagellar pocket similar to that caused by inhibition of endocytosis ( 1 ) . Second , TbRAB11 suppression has no effect on the kinetics of VSG delivery to the plasma membrane , which indicates that TbRAB11 is unlikely to be a signiﬁcant mediator of biosyn - thetic VSG export . Third , in the PCF the cells also become gradually more rounded but show no change to ﬂagellar pocket architecture . These distinct rates of response and morpholog - ical effects induced by TbRAB11 RNAi suggest that TbRAB11 may have different functions in these two life stages , as well as reﬂecting the markedly greater rate of endocytosis in blood - stream forms . Fourth , analysis of endocytic function following suppression of TbRAB11 reveals additional developmental differences ; in the BSF , the initial stages of both receptor - mediated and ﬂuid - phase endocytosis are unimpaired , but the recycling of degraded transferrin is almost completely blocked . By contrast , TbRAB11 suppression in the PCF leads to pro - found inhibition of both ﬂuid - phase and membrane protein endocytosis . These observations indicate that the key site of TbRAB11 function in the PCF is distinct from that in the BSF , and in contrast to the multiple endocytic pathways in the BSF , the vast majority of PCF trafﬁc appears to be directed toward the lysosome . At least two unanticipated aspects to the trypanosome traf - ﬁcking system have been uncovered in this study . Based pri - marily on an inability to detect secretory vesicles containing VSG but lacking associated TbRAB11 , it has been proposed that TbRAB11 transport vesicles represent the sole route of export for both recycling and newly synthesized VSG ( 31 ) . As almost all intracellular VSG participates in recycling and only a very small proportion of VSG is en route to the surface for the ﬁrst time , the detection of putative dedicated biosynthetic transporters by morphological analysis is challenging . How - ever , the data presented here indicate that TbRAB11 is not required for VSG export . Either TbRAB11 is present on exo - FIG . 6 . Fluid - phase marker and internalized surface protein both accumulate in the lysosome in the T . brucei PCF . ( A ) Fluid - phase markers colocalize with internalized surface protein in uninduced PCF cells . Uninduced p2T7Ti - TbRAB11 PCF cells were surface labeled with biotin and allowed to take up Alexa Fluor 488 dextran 10 000 ( green ) for 1 h at 28°C . External biotin was cleaved , and internalized biotin was visualized with Texas Red - labeled streptavidin ( red ) . Slides were counterstained with DAPI ( blue ) and examined immediately . ( B ) Loss of TbRAB11 causes enhanced p67 staining in PCF . p2T7Ti - TbRAB11 PTT cells were incubated for 3 days with ( ! TET ) or with - out ( % TET ) tetracycline . Cells were ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained with MAb280 against p67 .

Low concentrations of MAb280 were used to increase the speciﬁcity of signal . Cells were counterstained with DAPI ( blue ) . 978 HALL ET AL . E UKARYOT . C ELL cytic vesicles carrying newly synthesized VSG but does not have an essential role , or a second , and so far uncharacterized , pathway must be present for transport of newly synthesized VSG to the cell surface . Our second ﬁnding extends previous observations that uncovered a mechanism for cellular response to iron deprivation ( 30 ) . These earlier studies were based on limiting the effective concentration of transferrin , but here we have shown that the trypanosome is capable of sensing a de - crease in iron uptake due to partial inhibition of endocytic activity by an increase in the copy number of the receptor protein , compensating for a decrease in endocytic ﬂux . Hence , a sophisticated signaling system appears to subtend the trans - ferrin receptor to ensure adequate accumulation of iron . Cell - or development - speciﬁc Rab11 functions have been reported for other systems . For example , mammalian Rab11b speciﬁcally regulates Ca 2 ! - dependent exocytosis in neuronal but not nonneuronal cells ( 20 ) , and in Entamoeba histolytica Rab11 location alters during encystation , suggesting a chang - ing role during differentiation ( 25 ) . PCF trypanosomes , which have a low rate of endocytosis , do not separate surface proteins from ﬂuid - phase cargo in the same manner as the more endo - cytically active BSFs . In BSFs , the Rab5 isoforms TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B have distinct functions in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , while in PCFs they occupy the same compartment and have similar effects on ﬂuid - phase endocytosis ( 11 , 15 , 32 ) . The expression of constitutively active TbRAB5A is also asso - ciated with an increased uptake of low - density lipoprotein , but this accompanies an increase in receptor expression ( 32 ) . Al - tered TbRAB4 function affects ﬂuid - phase endocytosis in BSFs but interferes with both ﬂuid - phase and surface protein endo - cytosis in PCFs , again indicating a less diversiﬁed system in PCFs ( 14 ; B . S . Hall and M . C . Field , unpublished observa - tions ) . Hence , the lack of differentiation between ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis , as detected in the procy - clic cells , and the discrimination between these two endocytic processes in BSFs by suppression of TbRAB11 are fully con - sistent with previous data . In addition , as well as recycling GPI - anchored proteins from the early endosome to the sur - face , TbRAB11 regulates recycling from the late endosome ( 8 ) and may be required for maintenance of both directions of the pathways between early and late endosomes . The differences in regulation of endocytosis between the two life stages may reﬂect the different requirements for survival in insect and mammalian hosts . The developmental regulation of TbRAB11 function in T . brucei may be secondary to the gen - eral changes in endocytosis between the two stages but could also be a result of differential expression of TbRAB11 binding proteins leading to preferential association with different ves - icle populations within the endomembrane system . Mamma - lian Rab11 is capable of interacting with a variety of different proteins that target the GTPase to distinct compartments and allow participation in multiple functions ( 38 ) . Identiﬁcation of the TbRAB11 effectors present in the BSF and the PCF will be needed to determine the mechanism of TbRAB11 action in the different life stages .
