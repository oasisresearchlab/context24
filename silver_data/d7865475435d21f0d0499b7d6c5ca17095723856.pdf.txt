BKPyV infection is ubiquitous in the human population , with over 80 % of adults worldwide being seropositive for BKPyV . BKPyV infection is usually asymptomatic ; however , BKPyV reactivation in immunosuppressed transplant patients causes two diseases , polyomavirus - associated nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis . To estab - lish a successful infection in host cells , BKPyV must travel in retrograde transport vesicles to reach the nucleus . To make this happen , BKPyV requires the cooperation of host cell proteins . To further identify host factors associated with BKPyV entry and intracellular trafﬁcking , we performed a whole - genome small interfering RNA screen on BKPyV infection of primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells . The re - sults revealed the importance of Ras - related protein Rab18 and syntaxin 18 for BKPyV infection . Our subsequent experiments implicated additional factors that in - teract with this pathway and suggest a more detailed model of the intracellular traf - ﬁcking process , indicating that BKPyV reaches the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) lumen through a retrograde transport pathway between the late endosome and the ER . IMPORTANCE Polyomaviruses bind to a group of speciﬁc gangliosides on the plasma membrane of the cell prior to being endocytosed . They then follow a retrograde trafﬁcking pathway to reach the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . The viruses begin to disassemble in the ER and then exit the ER and move to the nucleus . However , the details of intracellular trafﬁcking between the endosome and the ER are largely un - known . By implementing a whole human genome small interfering RNA screen , we identiﬁed Rab18 , syntaxin 18 , and the NRZ complex as key components in endosome - ER trafﬁcking of the human polyomavirus BKPyV . These results serve to further elucidate the route BKPyV takes from outside the cell to its site of replication in the nucleus . KEYWORDS BKPyV , NRZ complex , Rab18 , siRNA screen , syntaxin 18 , virus trafﬁcking B K polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a small icosahedral DNA virus measuring approximately 45 nm in diameter that was ﬁrst isolated in 1971 ( 1 ) . Subsequent serology surveys have revealed that up to 80 % of the world’s population has been infected with BKPyV ( 2 ) and most of the initial infections occur in early childhood ( 3 ) . After initial exposure , BKPyV establishes an asymptomatic infection in the urinary tract with periodic shed - ding into the urine ( 4 ) . BKPyV reactivation when the immune system is compromised in transplant patients , however , causes two diseases , polyomavirus - associated ne - phropathy ( PVAN ) and hemorrhagic cystitis ( HC ) ( 5 ) . PVAN is one of the leading causes of graft failure after kidney transplantation ( 6 ) . Also , BKPyV can be detected in the urine of 90 % of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant patients who suffer from HC , according to a recent study ( 7 ) . Even though BKPyV was initially isolated more than 45 years ago , the choices for clinical management of BKPyV reactivation are limited .

Other options for treating BKPyV reactivation are treatment with cidofovir , leﬂunomide , and ﬂuoroquino - lones ; however , the beneﬁt of using these drugs in addition to reducing immunosup - pressants has been questioned and has not been investigated carefully in randomized studies ( 6 , 8 ) . Because of the lack of speciﬁc antiviral medicines , management of BKPyV reactivation remains a challenge . BKPyV does not encode any polymerases . As a result , BKPyV exclusively relies on the host DNA replication machinery for its genome replication . To establish a successful infection , BKPyV must deliver its DNA genome into the nucleus to access the host DNA replication machinery , which entails crossing the plasma membrane , the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane , and the nuclear envelope ( 9 ) . Also , BKPyV needs to navigate a crowded cytoplasm to reach the ER . Without any cooperation from host factors , this process would seem difﬁcult , if not impossible . Few host factors have previously been identiﬁed that participate in viral entry and intracellular trafﬁcking . To initiate infection , BKPyV binds to ganglioside GD1b or GT1b on the host cell membrane ( 10 ) . After binding to the cell membrane , BKPyV had been thought to enter host cells via a caveolin - mediated pathway ( 11 ) ; however , subsequent experiments showed that caveolin is dispensable for infection of human renal proximal tubule cells ( 12 ) . After endocytosis , BKPyV enters the endosome in the same way as other polyomaviruses ( 13 – 16 ) . Acidiﬁcation and maturation of the endosome are essential for BKPyV infection ( 17 ) and activate a sorting machinery that involves the Rab5 , Rab7 , Rab9 , and Rab11 proteins ( 14 , 15 , 18 ) . After sorting through the late endosome , vesicles that contain BKPyV trafﬁc along microtubules and reach the ER at 8 to 12 h postinfection ( 17 , 19 ) . ER lumen proteins are essential for polyomavirus disassembly and egress from the ER ( 9 , 17 , 20 – 22 ) . Brieﬂy , protein disulﬁde isomerases induce capsid conformational changes and minor capsid protein exposure ( 17 , 23 – 28 ) . These exposed minor proteins insert themselves into the ER membrane ( 29 , 30 ) , and partially disassembled polyomaviruses penetrate the ER membrane and enter the cytosol through the ER - associated degradation pathway ( 9 , 20 , 21 , 31 , 32 ) . In the cytosol , the nuclear localization signal of the minor capsid proteins guides polyoma - viruses into the nucleus via the importin (cid:2) / (cid:3) pathway ( 33 – 35 ) . In addition to this productive model of entry , a signiﬁcant portion of internalized polyomavirus enters a nonproductive pathway ( 36 ) . Distinguishing the critical events that BKPyV uses to establish successful infection from other pathways that BKPyV uses remains a chal - lenge . Numerous assays have been developed for the purpose of identifying host factors associated with viral infections , including genome - wide small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) screening . By silencing every single human gene with an siRNA pool and then assessing the effects of the knockdown on infection , it is feasible to dissect the functions of individual host proteins during the viral life cycle . siRNA screening has been extensively applied to research on viruses such as HIV ( 37 ) , West Nile virus ( 38 ) , human papillo - mavirus ( HPV ) ( 39 ) , vesicular stomatitis virus ( 40 ) , and another polyomavirus , simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) ( 41 ) . However , no genome - wide siRNA screen has been reported for BKPyV . Using a whole - genome siRNA screen , we have identiﬁed a series of potential host factors that are involved in BKPyV infection . DNAJ B14 , which has previously been implicated in BKPyV entry , is our top hit , and DNAJ B12 is also among our top 100 hits ( 21 , 41 ) . Most of the other hits we have identiﬁed have not been previously reported , however , and many of them are involved in vesicular transport . In this report , we present data showing that two of our primary hits , Rab18 and syntaxin 18 , as well as two members of the NRZ complex ( RAD50 interactor 1 and ZW10 kinetochore protein ) , which have previously been shown to interact with Rab18 and syntaxin 18 , are essential host factors for BKPyV infection .

To identify host factors involved in viral entry and intracellular trafﬁcking , we developed and implemented a high - throughput whole - genome siRNA screen for BKPyV infection in its natural host cells , primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial ( RPTE ) cells . In this screen , BKPyV infection was challenged with the Dharmacon siGENOME SMART - pool siRNA library , which includes more than 18 , 000 human siRNA pools . Each pool contains four unique siRNAs that target the same host gene . The screen was performed in triplicate . Every screen plate included the siGENOME nontargeting control ( NTC ) as a negative control and a synthetic siRNA that corresponds to the natural BKPyV 5p microRNA ( miRNA ) targeting the large tumor antigen ( TAg ) mRNA ( siTAg ) ( 42 ) as a positive control . Our lab previously showed that BKPyV induces G 2 / M arrest to take full advantage of the host DNA replication machinery ( 43 ) ; this provided us with a cost - efﬁcient approach to evaluate viral infection in siRNA - transfected cells . By applying a Hoechst DNA stain , cells in G 2 / M phase are distinguishable from the rest of the cells on the basis of the difference in DNA content in each nucleus . The percentage of G 2 / M - arrested cells ( G 2 % ) dramatically increases after BKPyV infection , and we adopted it as the readout for the screening assay . For the primary screen , RPTE cells were transfected with the siRNA library and cultured for 48 h to allow depletion of the targeted proteins . Next , cells were infected with BKPyV and cultured for an additional 2 days . The cells were ﬁxed and stained with Hoechst , and the numbers of nuclei in the different stages of the cell cycle were quantiﬁed , recorded , and uploaded to the MScreen web tool developed by the Center for Chemical Genomics ( University of Michigan ) ( 44 ) . G 2 % values were calculated with the MScreen web tool . To proceed with the data analysis , we scaled data from 0 to 100 , with 100 representing the effect of our positive control and 0 representing the effect of our negative control . The effect of each siRNA pool was then calculated using this index scale . A larger index value represents a stronger inhibitory effect on BKPyV infection when an siRNA pool is introduced into RPTE cells , which suggests that the targeted host factor is more likely to be required for BKPyV infection . The Z factor is a statistical parameter widely used for screen assay evaluation . A minimal Z factor of 0 . 5 is required for a reliable siRNA screen ( 45 ) . The overall Z factor achieved in our whole primary screen was 0 . 6 , and the R 2 values between replicates were approximately 0 . 9 . We compared the data from the three replicates in a pairwise manner , as illustrated in the scatterplots in Fig . 1 . Seventy percent of the siRNA pools in the siGENOME siRNA library inhibited BKPyV infection to some degree compared to the nontargeting siRNA control . A similar distribution of inhibitory effects was also observed in an siRNA screen using the siGENOME library to assess cellular genes involved in HPV infection ( 39 ) . For the results of the primary screen , see Table S1 in the supplemental material . We parsed the candidate genes into functional categories and pathways with the Database for Annotation , Visualization , and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ) enrichment analysis tool ( 46 , 47 ) . DAVID analysis showed that translation - related genes were the most enriched group of genes that are required for viral infection among the candidate genes ( Table S2 ) . Considering that BKPyV exclusively relies on the host protein synthesis machinery , this result is consistent with our expectation . Other than translation - related genes , several clusters of genes that are required for viral infection were also signiﬁ - cantly enriched , especially those for budding and coat proteins associated with vesic - ular transport . On the basis of the enrichment analysis results , we manually selected 147 siRNA pools for secondary validation . G 2 % is an indirect readout of BKPyV infection . Knocking down cell cycle regulatory proteins may also affect G 2 / M arrest independently of viral infection ; thus , false - positive or false - negative candidates could be introduced into the results during the primary screen . To eliminate these false candidates , we next applied a direct readout , immu - Rab18 as an Essential Host Factor for BKPyV Infection July / August 2017 Volume 2 Issue 4 e00291 - 17 msphere . asm . org 3 noﬂuorescent staining for the early viral protein TAg , to validate these 147 genes . RPTE cells were transfected and infected in 96 - well plates with a subset of the siGENOME library that contains the selected 147 siRNA pools . Infected cells were ﬁxed at 48 h postinfection and probed for TAg with a primary antibody and a ﬂuorescein isothio - cyanate ( FITC ) - labeled secondary antibody . After images were acquired , the integrated TAg ﬂuorescent intensity per nucleus was recorded and the inhibition index was calculated as in the primary screen ( Table S3 ) . After the secondary screen , DNAJ B14 , which has previously been implicated in BKPyV entry , was our top hit and DNAJ B12 and DNAJC3 , which are also involved in FIG 1 Visualization of whole - genome RNAi screen results . The effects of each siRNA pool are normalized to the NTC siRNA ( set as 0 ) and siTAg ( set as 100 ) . Index values from the replicates are illustrated in pairwise scatterplots .

Rab18 was one of our top validated hits other than these DNAJ proteins . Moreover , syntaxin 18 , a protein that has previously been dem - onstrated to interact with Rab18 , also passed our validation . The Rab18 / NRZ / syntaxin 18 complex is required for BKPyV infection . The Rab protein family is a group of small GTPases that regulate membrane trafﬁcking and that have been implicated in polyomavirus intracellular trafﬁcking ( 14 , 18 , 48 ) . Rab18 , however , had not previously been associated with polyomavirus infection . The Rab18 interaction network has been thoroughly investigated ( 49 ) , and more than 40 proteins have been identiﬁed as interacting with Rab18 . Among these proteins , syntaxin 18 was also one of our top hits in the screen . To determine whether Rab18 and syntaxin 18 are required during BKPyV infection , RPTE cells in 12 - well plates were transfected with pooled or individual siRNAs targeting these proteins . Cells transfected with the NTC siRNA pool and siTAg served as negative and positive controls , respectively . After transfection , cells were cultured for 2 days to allow for depletion of the targeted proteins and then infected with BKPyV at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 1 infectious unit ( IU ) / cell . Cells were lysed at 48 h postinfection , and expression of the targeted proteins , TAg , and (cid:3) - actin or glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) was assessed by Western blotting ( Fig . 2A ) . The choice of (cid:3) - actin or GAPDH was based on avoidance of comigration of the loading FIG 2 Rab18 , syntaxin 18 ( STX18 ) , and the NRZ complex are required for BKPyV infection . RPTE cells were transfected with the siRNAs indicated and then infected with BKPyV . Viral infection ( TAg ) , GAPDH or (cid:3) - actin expression levels , and knockdown efﬁciency were examined by Western blotting .

Knockdown of Rab18 and syntaxin 18 reduced TAg expression , indicating that both proteins are required for efﬁcient infection . Knockdown of Rab18 entirely blocked BKPyV infection . While there was only partial knockdown of syntaxin 18 with both the pooled and individual siRNAs , TAg expression decreased correspondingly . Because syntaxin 18 is a SNARE protein ( 50 ) , this suggests that BKPyV enters the ER lumen via a vesicle fusion step . In addition to syntaxin 18 , Rab18 interacts with ZW10 kinetochore protein ( ZW10 ) and RAD50 interactor 1 ( RINT1 ) , which , together with neuroblastoma ampliﬁed gene ( NAG ) , are members of the NRZ complex ( 51 ) . Upon activation by GTP , Rab18 interacts with the ZW10 kinetochore protein from the NRZ complex , thereby forming a Rab18 / NRZ / syntaxin 18 complex at the ER ( 49 ) . In this complex , syntaxin 18 functions as a t - SNARE on the ER membrane where the NRZ components work as a tether to assist with retrograde vesicle docking ( 51 , 52 ) . NRZ / syntaxin 18 cooperate in capturing Rab18 - labeled vesicles and initiating the fusion process on the ER membrane . Although none of the NRZ complex proteins were identiﬁed in our primary screen , we hypoth - esized that they are required for BKPyV infection because of their ability to interact with both Rab18 and syntaxin 18 . To test whether NRZ components are involved in BKPyV infection , we knocked down RINT1 and ZW10 and then infected cells . We could not test NAG because of the lack of a useful antibody to measure its expression . The Western blot results indicate that disruption of the NRZ complex by knocking down these two components interferes with infection ( Fig . 2B ) . Rab18 colocalizes with the viral capsid during BKPyV intracellular trafﬁcking . We next asked whether Rab18 is associated with BKPyV - containing vesicles , since Rab18 targets vesicles to the ER ( 53 , 54 ) . To test this , we ﬁxed RPTE cells at 6 and 8 h postinfection and stained them for BKPyV major capsid protein VP1 and Rab18 . Images of stained RPTE cells were acquired with a confocal microscope . The confocal images show that Rab18 and VP1 are partially colocalized at 6 and 8 h postinfection ( Fig . 3 ) . This is consistent with the asynchronous trafﬁcking of BKPyV from endosomes after FIG 3 Colocalization of Rab18 and BKPyV capsid protein VP1 . RPTE cells were ﬁxed at 6 and 8 h postinfection and stained for VP1 ( green ) , Rab18 ( red ) , and DAPI ( blue ) . Images were taken by confocal microscopy . Sequential z - stack images ( 0 . 25 - (cid:4) m increments ) from the bottom of the cell to the top ( left to right ) are shown . Arrows point to VP1 - Rab18 colocalization sites . Bars represent 5 (cid:4) m . Zhao and Imperiale July / August 2017 Volume 2 Issue 4 e00291 - 17 msphere . asm . org 6 entry ( 17 ) . These results support our hypothesis that BKPyV travels in Rab18 - positive vesicles after being sorted through endosomes . BKPyV trafﬁcs differently after Rab18 , syntaxin 18 , or NRZ knockdown . To establish a successful infection , BKPyV must reach the ER lumen , where disassembly occurs ( 17 ) . After internalization into host cells , conformational changes of the capsid are neither required nor observed before polyomaviruses enter the ER lumen ( 27 , 28 ) . When polyomavirus particles reach the ER lumen , luminal enzymes disrupt the disulﬁde bonds between VP1 monomers , thereby initiating disassembly of the viral capsid ( 26 ) . This process in the ER can be visualized by assaying for VP1 monomer , dimer , and oligomer bands after separation of proteins under nonreducing conditions by SDS - PAGE ( 17 , 28 ) . To conﬁrm that BKPyV requires Rab18 to reach the ER lumen and initiate disassembly , we examined BKPyV disassembly after Rab18 knockdown . RPTE cells were transfected with NTC or Rab18 siRNA for 48 h and infected with BKPyV at an MOI of 5 IU / cell . Protein samples were processed and assayed at 24 h postinfection by Western blotting of reducing and nonreducing gels ( 17 , 28 ) . At 0 h postinfection , most of the BKPyV particles were intact and too large to enter the nonreducing SDS - PAGE gel , and no VP1 monomers ( 42 kDa ) or dimers were visible . At 24 h postinfection in cells in which Rab18 was present , BKPyV began to disassemble and VP1 monomers , dimers , and oligomers could be detected . However , the nonreducing gel suggests that the BKPyV particle could not disassemble efﬁciently without Rab18 ( Fig . 4A , top ) . The reducing gel shows that equal amounts of VP1 are detectable in the presence or absence of Rab18 , indicating that knocking down Rab18 did not prevent BKPyV from attaching to or entering RPTE cells . We also assessed the effect of knocking down RINT1 , ZW10 , and syntaxin 18 on BKPyV disassembly ( Fig . 4A , bottom ) . In each case , smaller amounts of VP1 monomers and dimers were detected in the nonreducing gel , suggesting that BKPyV cannot disassemble efﬁciently without the help of the NRZ complex . Previous studies showed that mouse polyomavirus ( MPyV ) could enter cells that do not produce proper ganglioside receptors ; afterward , these MPyV particles are trapped in a dead - end pathway and cannot establish a successful infection . This indicates that polyomaviruses enter both productive and nonproductive pathways inside host cells . These nonproductive pathways result in a diffuse distribution of viral particles , as detected by immunoﬂuorescent staining ( 36 ) . In the presence of proper ganglioside receptors , polyomaviruses leave the cell periphery , move along microtubules , and reach the perinuclear area ( 17 , 19 , 55 , 56 ) . Ultimately , the productive pathway leads to the ER ( 17 , 28 , 57 ) . Since we saw that BKPyV could not reach the ER lumen without Rab18 while the entry of BKPyV was not affected ( Fig . 4A ) , we wished to address if BKPyV trafﬁcs in a different pattern under Rab18 knockdown . To test this , Rab18 was depleted as previously described and RPTE cells were infected with BKPyV at an MOI of 5 IU / cell . Cells were ﬁxed and stained for VP1 at 24 h postinfection ( Fig . 4B ) . In the presence of Rab18 , BKPyV forms bright foci in the perinuclear area , as previously observed ( 9 ) . However , Rab18 knockdown caused dispersion of the bright perinuclear VP1 foci and the staining of VP1 appeared to be diffuse and spread throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 4B ) . Thus , without Rab18 , BKPyV trafﬁcs in a pattern that is suggestive of a nonproductive pathway ( 36 ) . BKPyV is enriched in the late endosome without Rab18 . Our previous study demonstrated that acidiﬁcation of the endosome is essential for BKPyV infection ( 17 ) and MPyV colocalizes with the late endosome marker Rab7 after entry ( 18 ) . Further - more , BKPyV cannot trafﬁc efﬁciently to the ER and initiate capsid disassembly without abundant Rab18 and instead appears to be trapped in an unknown compartment ( s ) diffusely located in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 4 ) . To identify this compartment , we knocked down Rab18 in RPTE cells , ﬁxed the cells at 24 h postinfection , and probed for various organelle markers ( Fig . 5 ) . We found that the diffuse viral particles do not colocalize with the early endosome marker EEA1 , the cis - Golgi marker GM130 ( 58 ) , or the trans - Golgi marker Golgin 97 ( 59 ) . On the other hand , we found that the VP1 - rich area Rab18 as an Essential Host Factor for BKPyV Infection July / August 2017 Volume 2 Issue 4 e00291 - 17 msphere . asm . org 7 overlaps Rab7 . To further conﬁrm this colocalization , images of VP1 and Rab7 were taken by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 6 ) . We found that the dispersed VP1 partially colocalizes with Rab7 when Rab18 is knocked down , suggesting that some viral particles are trapped in the late endosome in the absence of Rab18 . There is also some VP1 that does not colocalize with Rab7 . This may be a result of asynchronous trafﬁcking of BKPyV , and additional intermediate and dead - end compartments could also exist during the retrograde trafﬁcking step between the endosome and the ER . Our results suggest that BKPyV reaches the ER lumen through a Rab18 - mediated retrograde transport pathway between the late endosome and the ER . DISCUSSION BKPyV was initially isolated more than 45 years ago ( 1 ) ; however , our understanding of the early events in the BKPyV life cycle contains gaps . Polyomaviruses appear to take FIG 4 Effects of Rab18 knockdown on BKPyV intracellular trafﬁcking .

However , some of the pathways that BKPyV uses are nonproductive ( 36 ) , which suggests that identifying host factors solely by morphological observations , especially protein colocalization evi - dence , may be deceiving . SV40 , BKPyV , MPyV , and cholera toxin have been observed to enter the cell via a caveolin - mediated pathway ( 11 , 60 – 64 ) . However , subsequent experiments have demonstrated that caveolin is dispensable ( 12 , 14 , 65 – 68 ) . Because of FIG 5 Colocalization of BKPyV and organelle markers .

Whole - genome siRNA screening provides an unbiased tool with which to investi - gate some of the remaining questions . However , one of the biggest challenges of developing an siRNA screen assay is ﬁnding a readout that is sensitive , cost efﬁcient , and suitable for high - throughput automation . One of the most common readouts for a viral siRNA screen is cell viability . However , BKPyV , along with many viruses , does not lyse host cells within a reasonable period compared to the duration of the RNA interference ( RNAi ) effect in cells . This behavior of BKPyV makes cell viability measure - ments impractical . Another common strategy to evaluate viral infection is incorporation of reporter genes into the viral genome . Because BKPyV is highly sensitive to genomic modiﬁcation , several approaches attempting to integrate reporter genes into the BKPyV genome have failed ( data not shown ) . Therefore , construction of modiﬁed viral particles containing a reporter gene was not practical for us . Finally , immunoﬂuorescent staining for viral protein expression is neither cost nor time efﬁcient for processing hundreds of plates . For all of these reasons , we needed a different readout for evaluation of viral infection . The percentage of cells in G 2 / M phase provided us a cost - efﬁcient assay for the primary screen . Our primary screen results indicated that knocking down 70 % of the human genes in RPTE cells inhibited BKPyV infection to some degree compared to the NTC . A similar data distribution was also observed in an siRNA screen for HPV infection with the same siRNA library ( 39 ) . We found that the NTC siRNA reproducibly slightly increased BKPyV infection compared to the no - siRNA control . This could be because of interference of exogenous siRNA with the host intrinsic miRNA processing and silencing mechanism . BKPyV encodes a miRNA that downregulates TAg mRNA levels ( 42 , 69 ) . If the introduction of exogenous siRNA affects the miRNA processing and FIG 6 Colocalization of VP1 and Rab7 .

Zhao and Imperiale July / August 2017 Volume 2 Issue 4 e00291 - 17 msphere . asm . org 10 silencing mechanism , TAg expression would increase because of lower levels of mature BKPyV miRNA . The increased BKPyV infection induced by the nontargeting siRNA control could also be an off - target effect of RNAi . While validating our primary screening results , we found that many of our primary hits were not reproducible when tested with individual siRNAs instead of siRNA pools . It appears that off - target effects of RNAi are inevitable for whole - genome siRNA screens , and an “ideal nontargeting” siRNA pool does not exist ( 70 ) . The most likely cause of the off - target effect is the passenger strand of the siRNA . Each siRNA carries a complementary ( passenger ) strand to enhance the stability of siRNA molecules . This passenger strand can also be integrated into the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) , which possibly increases off - target effects . Moreover , even if only the guide strand enters the RISC complex , RISC prefers the second to the eighth nucleotides of that strand , called the seed region , to recognize targeted mRNAs ( 70 – 74 ) . Considering this characteristic of RNAi , each seven - nucleotide seed region can target more than one gene . Off - target effects can therefore increase the expense of validation and lower the efﬁciency of screening . After validating some of the top hits , as well as other proteins that are known to be involved in the same vesicular trafﬁcking pathway , Rab18 , syntaxin 18 , ZW10 , and RINT1 were conﬁrmed as essential host factors for BKPyV infection . Rab18 has been associated with lipid droplet homeostasis and vesicular transport between the Golgi apparatus and the ER ( 53 , 54 ) . The majority of Rab18 usually localizes to the membrane of the ER and the cis - Golgi apparatus ( 53 ) . Also , Rab18 is recruited to the surface of lipid droplets , the endosome , and the lysosome ( 75 , 76 ) . Rab18 has been shown to interact with syntaxin 18 , ZW10 , and RINT1 by afﬁnity chromatography followed by mass spectrom - etry ( 49 ) . On the basis of previous studies on yeast proteins , ZW10 and RINT1 interact with each other via their N termini and interact with the NAG protein to form the NRZ complex . The t - SNARE protein syntaxin 18 on the ER membrane indirectly attaches to the NRZ complex ( 51 , 52 , 77 ) . The overall structure of the NRZ complex is a protrusion about 20 nm in length from the surface of the ER membrane ( 78 ) . GTP - activated Rab18 on the surface of vesicles interacts with ZW10 , thereby tethering vesicles to the ER membrane . Syntaxin 18 is a SNARE protein and mediates vesicle fusion to the ER ( 50 ) . After the NRZ complex captures vesicles , syntaxin 18 mediates vesicle fusion with the ER membrane . We propose a model of BKPyV entry and intracellular trafﬁcking to the ER that is based on previous ﬁndings and our present results ( Fig . 7 ) . To initiate infection , BKPyV ﬁrst binds to its ganglioside receptors GT1b and GD1b ( 10 ) . After initial attachment , BKPyV is believed to form deep invaginations of the host plasma membrane in the same manner as SV40 ( 79 ) . The length of ceramide tails of the ganglioside plays a critical role in the formation of the invagination ( 79 ) . Next , BKPyV enters host cells via a ganglioside - dependent , caveolin - and clathrin - independent pathway ( 12 , 80 ) . Mean - while , glycoproteins on the plasma membrane appear to serve as traps for polyoma - virus ( 81 ) ; viral particles that bind to glycoproteins will eventually enter nonproductive pathways . Only those particles that bind to the correct ganglioside receptor can enter the productive infection pathway ( 36 ) . Furthermore , binding to the gangliosides is sufﬁcient to drive the transport of artiﬁcial particles to the ER ( 18 ) . This indicates that binding to the proper ganglioside is both necessary and sufﬁcient for BKPyV to trafﬁc in retrograde transport vesicles to the ER . In addition , conformational changes of the capsid are neither required nor observed before polyomaviruses enter the ER lumen ( 27 , 28 ) . These ﬁndings reveal that BKPyV may remain bound to the membrane throughout intracellular trafﬁcking until it reaches the ER lumen . BKPyV enters the endosome in the same manner as other polyomaviruses ( 13 – 15 ) . Acidiﬁcation of the endosome activates a ganglioside - sorting machinery that sorts BKPyV into secondary vesicles along with gangliosides ( 17 , 18 , 82 ) . Without Rab18 , we found that BKPyV accumulates in the late endosome ( marked by Rab7 ) . This suggests that Rab18 medi - ates late - endosome - to - ER trafﬁcking of BKPyV and that it buds and trafﬁcs together with virus - containing vesicles along microtubules ( 17 , 19 , 55 , 83 ) . After the NRZ Rab18 as an Essential Host Factor for BKPyV Infection July / August 2017 Volume 2 Issue 4 e00291 - 17 msphere . asm . org 11 complex on the ER membrane captures and tethers vesicles to the ER surface , syntaxin 18 further interacts with a yet - to - be - identiﬁed v - SNARE on the vesicles and the syntaxin 18 / v - SNARE complex mediates vesicle fusion to the ER membrane . This allows success - ful entry of BKPyV into the ER lumen . Our ﬁnding supports the conclusion that late - endosome - to - ER trafﬁcking plays a critical role in BKPyV infection . It has been shown that ﬂuorescently labeled gangliosides can spontaneously move in a retrograde direction to the ER ( 77 ) . BKPyV and the other polyomaviruses are therefore like hitchhikers that take a ride along this ganglioside - mediated retrograde pathway to the ER . Whether additional interactions between the viral capsid and host proteins play a role in BKPyV trafﬁcking to the ER is still unclear . Gangliosides play important roles in both endocytosis and retrograde trafﬁcking . Polyomaviruses and several toxins are proposed to take advantage of lipid - mediated endocytosis and retrograde trafﬁcking pathways ( reviewed by Ewers and Helenius [ 80 ] ) . Besides polyo - maviruses , some other nonenveloped viruses infect cells in a similar manner ; therefore , they may also utilize part of this lipid - mediated retrograde trafﬁcking pathway to establish an infection ( 84 ) ; the retrograde paths of both HPV and BKPyV can be blocked with the retrograde trafﬁc inhibitors retro - 1 , retro - 2 , and brefeldin A ( 17 , 39 , 85 , 86 ) . Norovirus also binds to gangliosides ( 87 , 88 ) and forms deep invaginations on model membranes ( 89 ) . Gangliosides have been demonstrated to be important for rotavirus infection ( 90 ) , and rotavirus also trafﬁcs to and is sorted through the endosome ( 91 ) . However , details of the Rab18 - mediated pathway are largely unknown and further efforts are needed to fully reveal the details of this retrograde trafﬁcking pathway . FIG 7 Model of BKPyV vesicular trafﬁcking . BKPyV enters a vesicle from the membrane of the endosome . GTP - bound Rab18 then interacts with ZW10 of the NRZ tethering complex . Syntaxin 18 on the ER membrane interacts with v - SNARE , and syntaxin 18 and v - SNARE mediate vesicle fusion .

Primary RPTE cells purchased from Lonza were maintained in the recommended medium , REGM BulletKit ( REGM / REBM , CC - 3190 ; Lonza ) , at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 in a humidiﬁed incubator . Cells recovered from a single frozen vial from Lonza ( passage 2 ) were cultured for three passages . Afterward , cells at passage 5 were passaged one more time and plated for screening or aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later experiments . For all experiments other than the primary screen , frozen aliquots ( passage 5 ) were recovered about 1 week before each experiment and cells were then plated for experiments . Infection . BKPyV ( Dunlop ) was cultured and puriﬁed on a cesium chloride linear gradient , and titers were determined as described previously ( 17 , 92 ) . RPTE cells were infected as follows at 2 days after siRNA transfection . Cells were prechilled for 15 min at 4°C . Puriﬁed viruses were diluted to 175 , 000 IU / ml ( MOI of 1 IU / cell ) or 875 , 000 IU / ml ( MOI of 5 IU / cell ) in REBM / REGM . A 400 - (cid:4) l volume of the diluted virus was added to the wells of a 12 - well plate and incubated at 4°C for 1 h with shaking every 15 min to distribute the inoculum over the entire well . The plate was transferred to 37°C after the 1 - h incubation . siRNA and siRNA library .
