Hoppe 1 , 2 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) internalizes plasma membrane by reshaping small regions of the cell surface into spherical vesicles . The key mechanistic question of how coat assembly produces membrane curvature has been studied with molecular and cellular structural biology approaches , without direct visualization of the process in living cells ; resulting in two competing models for membrane bending . Here we use polarized total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( pol - TIRF ) combined with electron , atomic force , and super - resolution optical microscopy to measure membrane curvature during CME . Surprisingly , coat assembly accommodates membrane bending concurrent with or after the assembly of the clathrin lattice . Once curvature began , CME proceeded to scission with robust timing . Four color pol - TIRF showed that CALM accumulated at high levels during membrane bending , implicating its auxiliary role in curvature generation . We conclude that clathrin - coat assembly is versatile and that multiple membrane - bending trajectories likely re ﬂ ect the energetics of coat assembly relative to competing forces .

This process has been intensely studied because of its importance in cell biology , and as a model of a dynamic supermacromolecular assembly . However , the progres - sion of clathrin - coat assembly and its relationship to curvature have remained unclear , with morphologies inferred from static electron microscopy images and structural biology models 3 – 10 . Observations made by electron microscopy over 35 years ago suggested that clathrin oligomerizes into ﬂ at hexagonal lattices on the plasma membrane that rearrange into spheres via the tran - sition of some of the lattice hexagons into pentagons 9 . However , energetic arguments suggest that this structural conversion would be energetically costly , requiring large protein contacts or ostensibly rigid structures to be broken and reformed during the hexagon to pentagon transition . This leads to a model in which membrane bending occurs progressively with the assembly of clathrin 7 , 8 , 11 ( Fig . 1a ) . Recently , electron tomography / correlative ﬂ uorescence microscopy of thick - sections supported the model of pre - assembled ﬂ at clathrin sheets that subsequently bend into vesicles 10 ( Fig . 1b ) . Thus , there remains uncertainty in the fun - damental mechanism by which the membrane bends during clathrin - coat assembly . Total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy has been an invaluable tool for analyzing the dynamics of endocy - tosis and associated proteins at the cell surface 6 . Axelrod and colleagues pioneered pol - TIRF microscopy to generate contrast between vertical and horizontal DiI - C18 - labeled plasma mem - brane in living cells 12 – 16 . Using this approach , they were able to capture the dynamics of membrane topographical changes during exocytosis of chromaf ﬁ n granules 11 . Here , we have re ﬁ ned pol - TIRF micoscopy and validated its ability to accurately measure the small changes in membrane topography by electron and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . Computer simulations of two topographical membrane - bending models predicted the relationship between pol - TIRF , clathrin and dynamin signals . We demonstrate that in cells genome edited to express ﬂ uorescent protein - tagged clathrin and dynamin , clathrin - coated structures can form as curved membranes that accumulate clathrin or as pre - accumulated ﬂ at clathrin sites that then bend membrane to form pits . Both behaviors were observed within single living cells , suggesting that local bio - chemical and biophysical factors can mediate a switch between these two modes . This work demonstrates that the clathrin coat is ﬂ exible and that the rate - limiting step for vesicle formation is the induction of membrane bending , which may be regulated by axillary proteins such as CALM . 80 Clathrin Clathrin a b c d WT Corr # F l a t # D o m ed # R ound 40 0 80 40 0 80 80 120 Radius ( nm ) 160 200 240 40 40 0 0 Fig . 1 Mechanisms of membrane bending during CME and clathrin ultrastructure in unroofed SK - MEL - 2 cells . a Schematic representation of CME in which membrane bending proceeds with a ﬁ xed radius of curvature during the addition of clathrin subunits . b Representation of CME in which clathrin ﬁ rst assembles into a ﬂ at sheet that remodels into a vesicle . c Correlative dSTORM and platinum - replica TEM images of ﬂ uorescently labeled clathrin ( magenta ) demonstrate a range of heterogeneous topographies even at the earliest stages of CME ; scale bar is 200 nm . d The size distribution observed amongst clathrin structures in WT SK - MEL - 2 cells ( black ) or SK - MEL - 2 cells exogenously expressing clathrin light chain for correlative microscopy ( blue ) .

The two membrane - bending models exhibit distinct and opposing relationships between changing pit size and incorporation of new clathrin subunits . We applied single - molecule super - resolution immuno - ﬂ uorescence of clathrin light chain combined with platinum - replica correlative electron microscopy to image the structure of even the smallest clathrin - coated assemblies at the plasma membrane of SK - MEL - 2 cells ( Fig . 1c ) . The ﬂ uorescence signal of clathrin - coat proteins associated with clathrin structures increased from ﬂ at to domed to highly curved clathrin structures , suggesting that clathrin was added during these transitions ( Fig . 1d ) . Additionally , the observed morphologies were hetero - geneous and displayed a range of lateral radii ( Fig . 1d and Sup - plementary Figures 3 , 4 ) , raising the possibility that clathrin accommodates multiple modes of membrane bending as well as the addition of new clathrin subunits at different morphological stages 17 , 18 . Computer simulation of membrane - bending signals as mea - sured by pol - TIRF . Measuring the dynamics of membrane bending during clathrin assembly at single endocytic sites in living cells is necessary to distinguish the possible modes of membrane bending . Pol - TIRF has been used to image changes in membrane topography during exocytosis of chromaf ﬁ n granules , which are much larger than CME sites 11 , 19 , 20 . We developed a microscope capable of creating pol - TIRF ﬁ elds that were parallel ( s - pol , S ) or perpendicular ( p - pol , P ) to the coverslip with improved spatial uniformity by averaging multiple illumination directions 21 , 22 ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . The P and S ﬁ elds were used to selectively excite DiI molecules in vertical or horizontal membrane , respectively , thereby encoding membrane curvature into the ratio of P / S ﬂ uorescence images ( Fig . 2a ) . A computer simulation of pol - TIRF for the formation of 100 nm vesicles by either model ( Fig . 1a , b ) predicted that the P / S image was sen - sitive to small changes in membrane bending ( Fig . 2c ) . Although the simulation predicted small differences between the two CME 0 . 4 s - Polarized p - Polarized Glasscoverslip Clathrincoat Dil - C18 probe b c h a d e f g 0 . 4 0 . 2 – 0 . 2 0 Class 1 Class 2 0 . 3 P / S P / S C l a t h r i n P / S i n t en s i t y ( A .

For membrane bending during assembly , clathrin and P / S increase together as the pit forms ( Fig . 2b ) . Conversely , for the model in which a ﬂ at clathrin patch is reshaped into a sphere , the clathrin intensity is maximal prior to changes in P / S , and then decreases as bending moves the top of the structure deeper into the exponentially decaying TIRF ﬁ eld ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Figure 1 ) . We considered the possibility that detection of the P / S signal would be less sensitive than detection of ﬂ uorescent cla - thrin arrival , thereby creating an apparent temporal delay between clathrin arrival and membrane bending . However , simulations of P / S and clathrin over a range of signal - to - noise ratios ( SNRs ) indicated that detection of P / S is weakly dependent on the SNR , and that the two models are distinguishable over a wide range of SNRs encountered in our live - cell imaging data ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Validation of pol - TIRF by correlative imaging . Next , we directly validated pol - TIRF ’ s sensitivity to membrane bending during CME by correlative light and electron ( CLEM ) , and light and atomic force microscopy ( CLAFM ) . In pol - TIRF - CLEM , endogenous clathrin - Tq2 ﬂ uorescence colocalized with the expected clathrin ultrastructure ( Fig . 2d ) and corresponding P / S signals were observed on individual clathrin - coated pits over a range of invagination stages ( Fig . 2e ) . Importantly , P / S increased with pit stage as determined by morphology ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) , and with pit heights determined from TEM tomograms ( Fig . 2h , ρ = 0 . 548 , p < 0 . 001 , and Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Pol - TIRF - CLAFM on wet samples con ﬁ rmed pol - TIRF ’ s sensitivity for membrane bending , despite the reduced resolution achieved by AFM owing to the softness of biological samples . Speci ﬁ cally , the endogenous clathrin - Tq2 and P / S overlaid with peaks in the AFM images ( Fig . 2f , g ) and pit height and P / S were positively correlated ( Fig . 2h , ρ = 0 . 351 , p < 0 . 001 , and Supplementary Fig - ure 4 ) . The observed variability in the P / S ratio relative to the CLEM and CLAFM measurements was predominantly a result of adjacent topographical features containing vertical membrane being located within the optical resolution of the measured cla - thrin structure ( Fig . 2h and Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Given this limitation , the pol - TIRF P / S ratio showed good agreement with both EM and AFM measurements and is sensitive to membrane bending on the length scale of CME . Live - cell imaging and tracking of membrane - bending dynam - ics during CME . Given that pol - TIRF could reliably detect nanoscale changes in membrane bending , we recorded the dynamics of membrane bending at single endocytic events in SK - MEL - 2 cells labeled with DiI that express gene - edited clathrin - Tq2 and dynamin2 - eGFP 23 ( Supplementary Figure 5 and Sup - plementary Movies 1 - 2 ) . Single diffraction - limited endocytic events were tracked 24 , ﬁ ltered to retain only those that contained isolated clathrin , dynamin , and P / S events , and categorized based on detection of membrane bending relative to clathrin arrival ( Fig . 3 ) . The reliability of the detection of P / S relative to clathrin arrival can be seen in the example traces ( Supplementary Fig - ures 7 – 9 ) . From these cells , ~ 7100 tracks had clathrin - Tq2 sig - natures that appeared and disappeared during the time of imaging . Of these tracks , 481 were selected for analysis based on a set of criteria , the most stringent of which were the absence of adjacent membrane curvature signals in the P / S image and a dynamin signature ( Supplementary Figure 6a ) . In approximately half of the CME events , membrane bending was detected at the moment clathrin arrived and then grew in intensity ( Fig . 3a , Class 1 ) , consistent with bending during clathrin - coat assembly . In the other half of the events , clathrin accumulated prior to detection of membrane bending ( Fig . 3b , c ) . The delayed bending group was divided into two categories — a small subset in which all of the clathrin accumulated at the endocytic site prior to membrane bending ( Fig . 3b , Class 2 ) , and a larger group , in which some clathrin accumulated prior to bending , but additional clathrin was then added during the membrane bending ( Fig . 3c , Class 3 ) . The relative proportions of these events were Class 1 ( 43 % ) , Class 2 ( 14 % ) , and Class 3 ( 43 % ) ( Fig . 3d ) . Thus , within the same cell , clathrin assembly and membrane bending occurs with heterogeneous timing and the clathrin coat accommodates several modes of membrane bending . Variable timing of membrane bending relative to clathrin assembly . A population view of membrane - bending dynamics during CME revealed a variable delay between clathrin assembly and the onset of membrane bending . We observed that the clathrin lifetimes for Class 1 were shorter than Class 2 and 3 events ( Class 1 ( 80 ± 42 s ) , Class 2 / 3 ( 108 ± 39 s ) , p < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4a ) . Unlike clathrin , the lifetimes of membrane bending and dynamin showed no statistical differences across classes ( Fig . 4a ) , indicating that the dynamics of these processes are identical regardless of class . Thus , Class 2 / 3 events had a delay in progression that was not present in Class 1 events . Delays of unknown mechanism have been suggested for CME 25 and a checkpoint related to membrane bending has been proposed 24 . In comparison with Class 1 , Class 2 / 3 events lagged behind the start of clathrin assembly with Δ t = 25 . 5 s ( Fig . 4b ) . This same delay was also observed when comparing the lag for dynamin between Class 1 and Class 2 / 3 ( Δ t = 24 . 1 s ) ( Fig . 4b ) . We observed minimal differences between the dynamin lag from P / S initiation across the classes ( Δ t = 0 . 2 s , Fig . 4b ) , indicating that the principle difference in lifetime for the two classes arose during the time that clathrin began to assemble and the onset of membrane bending ( Fig . 4c ) . These results raise the possibility that the initial moments of clathrin association with the plasma membrane determine whether bending will begin immediately or if a ﬂ at intermediate state will form . Correlative dSTORM — platinum replica TEM of very - small clathrin structures containing only a few triskelia revealed both ﬂ at and curved morphologies ( Fig . 1c ) , consistent with a bifurcation for entry into either Class 1 or Class 2 / 3 occurring early in the assembly process . Factors that in ﬂ uence this bifurcation could include the shape of the membrane at the moment clathrin binds , lateral membrane tension 26 , curvature sensing / generating proteins 27 , the stabilization of a curved state by factors such as AP2 28 , or engagement of the actin cytoskeleton 25 . Consistent with a stabilization step being required , we observed many short - lived ( < 18 s ) ﬂ at clathrin structures that did not recruit dynamin ( Supplementary Figure 6b – d ) . Close inspection of the CME events did not reveal any examples of P / S signals that preceded clathrin , suggesting that either initial membrane topography was not a factor in de ﬁ ning the sites at which clathrin assembled or that the scale of membrane bending needed to recruit clathrin was below detection . Essentially , all CME structures that acquired a P / S signal acquired dynamin , indicating that once membrane bending starts , progression to a vesicle is robust ( Fig . 4b ) . Thus , within the same cell , clathrin bends the membrane through multiple heterogeneous pathways in which the initiation of curvature is likely a rate - limiting step ( Fig . 4c ) . Auxiliary protein CALM accumulates at high density during membrane bending . CME involves the recruitment of many auxiliary proteins 6 . The protein CALM has been ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 02818 - 8 4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 419 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 02818 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications shown to facilitate membrane bending and regulate pit size by binding clathrin , AP2 , and the plasma membrane to facilitate CME 29 . Additionally , correlative light / platinum replica TEM indicated that CALM associates at low levels with ﬂ at clathrin structures , but is greatly enriched on curved membranes 30 , supporting the idea that CALM may dynamically regulate membrane curvature . To image CALM in the context of clathrin accumulation and membrane bending , we expanded the design of the microscope to include an additional imaging channel ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) and expressed CALM - iRFP682 at low levels via a retroviral expression . Pol - TIRF showed that CALM was robustly recruited in a biphasic manner to sites of CME , arriving ﬁ rst at low density and then accumulating a higher density either before or during membrane bending ( Fig . 5 ) . CALM was robustly recruited to CME sites during membrane bending regardless of which membrane bending class ( based on clathrin and P / S signals ) was observed ( Fig . 5 ) . Thus , clathrin assembly can be coincident with membrane bending or precede membrane bending , but the arrival of CALM correlates strongly with the generation of curvature . This tight dynamic relationship along with extensive structural data 29 indicates that CALM likely contributes to the energy needed for membrane bending . Discussion Here we have measured the membrane - bending dynamics during assembly of single - CME events using newly developed methods . These data provide the ﬁ rst direct observations of clathrin ’ s ability to accommodate multiple membrane - bending trajectories that are not predicted by the current structural models of endo - cytosis ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Rather , the observed curvature trajectories favor a model in which cooperating and competing energies de ﬁ ne the trajectory . Factors in ﬂ uencing these energetics could include lateral membrane tension 26 , local actin polymerization 25 , cargo loading , cargo identity 31 , chemical signals , charged and uncharged lipid sorting , and the recruitment of auxiliary CME components 32 , 33 . Multiple bending trajectories could be observed on the plasma membrane of single living cells . This suggests that the factors in ﬂ uencing membrane bending are restricted to small regions of the plasma membrane and could locally modulate the process . For example , local membrane tension differences or the subcellular distribution of auxiliary factors including CALM could regulate membrane bending 29 . Further work to elucidate the dynamics of other auxiliary CME proteins , membrane ten - sion , and other signals during membrane bending , will be needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the structural and biophysical nature of membrane curvature generation during CME . 400 P / S 1 . 33 μ m 22 . 7 s Clathrin a d b c Dynamin 200 I n t en s i t y ( A .

Protein was quanti ﬁ ed by Bradford assay and 20 μ g of the sample was loaded per lane on a 10 % SDS - PAGE gel . The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocked in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 and 3 % BSA . After 30 min , Anti - clathrin H - 55 antibody ( Santa Cruz ) and Anti - GFP B - 2 antibody ( Santa Cruz ) were added at a 1 : 100 dilution to the membrane and incubated overnight . Blot was then stained using secondary antibodies conjugated to DyLight - 680 and 700 . Membrane was then imaged on a LICOR IR imaging system . CALM - iRFP cloning . CALM - pmCherryN1 6 was a gift from Christien Merri ﬁ eld ( Addgene plasmid # 27691 ) and piRFP682 - N1 37 was a gift from Vladislav Ver - khusha ( Addgene plasmid # 45459 ) . mCherry was replaced with iRFP682 using XmaI and NotI digestion and ligation . CALM - iRFP682 was ampli ﬁ ed using the following primers and cloned into pIB2 38 , a gift from Inder Verma ( Addgene plasmid # 12371 ) , using AgeI and NotI digestion : 5 ′ - GGGGTGGACCATCCTCTAGACTGCCGGAT CCACGCGTCCGTCAGA TCCGCTAGCGCTA3 ′ - GATCTTCAATTGTTTTACGTATCTCGAATTCATGCATTTCACTCTTC CATCACGCCGATC Retroviral transduction . 1× 10 5 293T packaging cells were transfected for 48h to generate retrovirus using 2 . 1 μ g total DNA ( 1 μ g pIB2 - CALM - iRFP682 , 1 μ g pCL - Eco , and 100 ng VSV - G 39 , a gift from Bob Weinberg ( Addgene plasmid # 8454 ) ) with 4 μ g Polyethylenimine ( linear , 25 , 000 gmol − 1 , Polysciences , Inc . , Warrington , PA ) . The supernatant was harvested and ﬁ ltered through a sterile 0 . 3 μ m ﬁ lter , and added to 1× 10 5 SK - MEL - 2 for 48h . TIRF - based ﬂ uorescence microscopy . TIRF - based imaging was conducted using an inverted microscope built around a Till iMic ( Till Photonics , Germany ) equipped with a 60 ×1 . 49 N . A . oil immersion objective lens , diagrammed in Supplementary Figure 2 . The microscope was enclosed in an environmental chamber and maintained at a temperature of 35 – 37 °C using heater fans . Excitation for pol - TIRF was provided by a 561 nm laser . Excitation for mTurquoise2 eGFP and iRFP682 constructs was provided by 445 , 488 , and 633 nm lasers , respectively . The 445 , 488 , and 561 nm lasers were combined into an acousto - optic - tunable ﬁ lter and launched into a single - mode ﬁ ber . The 633 nm laser was launched into a separate single - mode ﬁ ber , and the beam paths were combined with a polychroic re ﬂ ector ZT405 / 532 / 635rpc ( 2 . 2mm substrate , Chroma Technology , Bellows Falls , VT ) . Laser excitation was sent to a 2D scan head ( Yanus , Till Photonics ) , which , along with a galvanometric mirror pair ( PolyTrope , Till Photonics ) , was used to position the laser focal spot in the back focal plane of the objective lens for 2 - point and 360 - TIRF illumination . A polychromic mirror re ﬂ ected excitation wavelengths to the sample , ZT440 / 488 / 561 / 635rpc ( 3 mm substrate , Chroma Technology ) . Fluorescence emissions were ﬁ rst separated by a longpass dichroic mirror ( ZT543rdc , 3 mm substrate , Chroma Technology ) to re ﬂ ect blue and green to one arm of the microscope , whereas a second longpass dichroic re ﬂ ected blue to detector D4 ( ZT488rdc , 3mm substrate , Chroma Technology ) , and allowed green to pass to detector D3 . Red and Far - Red ﬂ uorescence was transmitted to the second arm , and a longpass dichroic ( T647lpxr , 2mm substrate , Chroma Technology ) allowed far - red ﬂ uorescence to pass to detector , D1 , and re ﬂ ected red to detector , D2 . Bandpass ﬁ lters were used in front of each detector ( D4 ( Tq2 ) — FF01 - 470 / 22 , Semrock , Inc . Rochester , NY , D3 ( eGFP ) — FF02 - 510 / 10 m , Semrock , Inc . D2 ( DiI ) — ET595 / 50 m , Chroma Technology , and D1 ( iRFP682 ) — FF01 - 680 / 42 , Semrock , Inc . ) and ﬁ nally collected on four electron - multiplying charge - coupled device cameras ( iXon3 885 , Andor Technology , Belfast , Ireland ) . The magni ﬁ ed pixel size was 133 nm a side . The exposure time was held constant at 100ms for 442 , 488 , and 633 excitations and 100 – 125 ms for P and S excitation . For 2 - point images , the P and S images at each position were 50 – 62 . 5 ms . Laser powers were measured using a PM120D digital handheld power meter ( ThorLabs , Newton , NJ ) and were typically between 0 . 5 and 20mW during imaging . Bias calibration was performed by acquiring a set of 30 images with a closed shutter in front of each camera . The image stack was averaged to calculate the representative bias level in each pixel . Bias images were subtracted from each frame in the raw data set . Back focal plane centering . In order to determine the center of the objective lens ’ optical axis , a calibration was carried out daily and for each chamber used in data acquisition . This centering calibration ensured that the excitation laser light encountered the glass / cell interface with a single incidence angle and , hence , produced a single TIRF excitation volume . To map the angles of TIRF re ﬂ ectance , a computer program steered the laser to positive and negative mirror positions , and thus incidence angles , over 1002 steps , and the intensity of the re ﬂ ected light from the glass / water interface was read on a quadrant photodiode module . Intensity values were plotted as a function of mirror position and the half - maximal values were used to adjust the mirror angles to center the optical axis ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Fiducial data collection and image registration . Images were registered using calibration images acquired simultaneously on each of the four EMCCD detectors . Brie ﬂ y , 200 nm green beads ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) immobilized on a glass coverslip were excited using 445 nm excitation , and the images were acquired as a single bead was moved across the ﬁ eld of view to create a well - sampled grid . The beads were localized in each channel , and a rigid af ﬁ ne transformation was used to transform all points onto the red channel . Simulation . To predict the quantitative relationships between clathrin assembly and membrane - bending signals from pol - TIRF , we created a discrete 3D simula - tion in MATLAB ( The MathWorks Inc , Natick , MA ) and DIPimage toolbox version 2 . 8 ( Delft University of Technology , Delft , The Netherlands ) , building on our previous work for 3D microscopy simulations 21 , 40 , 41 . The plasma membrane was represented as a plane that could either be bent into a sphere via a ﬁ xed radius of curvature ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Figure 1 ) or through progressive bending ( Fig . 1b , Supplementary Figure 1 ) , forming a vesicle of diameter = 100nm . For membrane bending during assembly , the forming clathrin pit was modeled as a sphere of ﬁ xed radius ( r = 50 nm ) intersecting a plane . By shifting the center of the sphere along the z direction , we obtain the topographies outlined in Supplementary Figure 1a . In this case , clathrin is assumed to cover the spherical cap and ultimately the spherical vesicle . In the case of clathrin assembly preceding curvature , the pit is modeled as a circular patch of membrane emanating from the plane of plasma membrane . Here the circular patch is designated to have uniform lateral clathrin intensity and the sphere is translated vertically over a progression of discrete radii . Thus , the vertical shift was set to z shift = Area / 2 π / r i , where r i ranged NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 02818 - 8 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 419 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 02818 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 from 25 , 000 nm ( slightly bent ) to 50 nm ( fully formed sphere ) . This produced the progression in outlined in Supplementary Figure 1b . The ﬂ uorophores were modeled relative to each discrete element of plasma membrane or clathrin coat . Since 360 - TIRF illumination was used for the clathrin images , no orientation dependencies were modeled . Thus , the equation de ﬁ ning the 2 - dimensional clathrin image is given by , I c x ; y ; k ð Þ ¼ N (cid:1) PSF X ; Y ⊛ Z z I c e (cid:2) z = d d z (cid:3) ; ð 1 Þ where , I c is the 3D ( x , y , z ) distribution of clathrin during pit stage k , d is the penetration depth of the TIRF ﬁ eld ( 100 nm ) , the microscope point spread function was modeled as a Gaussian distribution of full - width half max ( FWHM ) of 211 nm , typical of a 1 . 49 N . A . objective lens . Detection noise ( N ) was modeled by drawing intensities from a Poisson distribution . Simulation of the pol - TIRF signals was achieved using the pol - TIRF ﬂ uorophore excitation equations of Axelrod and Anatharam 12 for the relative contributions of a plane and a sphere . Based on this work , we assume that the depth - dependent detection of emitted polarizations in the near ﬁ eld was approximately constant for a 1 . 49 N . A . objective , and could therefore be neglected . Thus , using our discrete model , the polarization for a growing pit could be described as a plane and spherical components excited by either p - pol or s - pol illumination .

Beta was determined by measuring planar regions of the plasma membrane and measuring the regional minimum that was found to be 0 . 26 , which sets β = 70° , which is nearly identical to the 69° value measured by Anantharam et al . 12 . Discrete simulations were conducted on a 2 nm grid over pit morphological states , and then downsampled to nominal microscope pixel dimensions of 125 nm in x and y , and blurred with a Gaussian PSF with FWHM = 211 nm . Detection noise ( N ) was modeled by drawing intensities from a Poisson distribution . The code for this simulation will be made available via the Mathworks File Exchange . Correlative pol - TIRF – TEM and pol - TIRF – AFM . SK - MEL - 2 expressing endogen - ous clathrin - Tq2 were plated on ﬁ bronectin - coated coverslips for 5h , labeled with DiI , and sonicated with a Branson Digital Soni ﬁ er 450 in stabilization buffer ( 70 mM KCl , 30 mM Hepes , 5 mM MgCl 2 , at pH 4 , and 1mM DTT ) with a 1 / 8 ” tapered microtip ~ 5 mm above the coverslip for a single 400 ms pulse at 10 % amplitude . Stabilization buffer was immediately removed after sonication using an aspirator and ﬁ xed with 2 % formaldehyde , para ( PFA ) ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) for 20 min followed by pol - TIRF imaging in PBS . In order to identify the same cells for correlative EM , a 9× 9 grid of ﬂ uorescent images surrounding the cell of interest was collected , and a circle was drawn on the underside of the coverslip approxi - mately around the imaged area using a high precision ﬁ ne diamond scriber with a 0 . 5mm diameter tip ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . The coverslips were mounted on a slide with 10 µ L of 2 % glutaraldehyde to keep the sample hydrated ( Sigma Aldrich ) . The coverslip was sealed with VALAP ( 1 : 1 : 1 mixture of Vaseline , lanolin , and paraf ﬁ n ) and epoxy prior to shipment for TEM or AFM . Electron microscopy . Coverslips were transferred from glutaraldehyde into freshly prepared 0 . 1 % w / v tannic acid in water and incubated at room temperature for 20 min . They were then rinsed 4× in water and transferred into 0 . 1 % w / v uranyl acetate and incubated for 20min , and rinsed with water prior to dehydration . Dehydration into ethanol , critical point drying , coating with platinum and carbon , replica lifting , and TEM were performed as previously described 42 . Replicas were placed onto Formvar / carbon - coated 75 - mesh copper TEM grids ( Ted Pella 01802 - F ) . Atomic force microscopy . Correlated ﬂ uorescence - AFM was performed using an Olympus IX73 inverted microscope equipped with an Olympus PlanApo 60× 1 . 45 N . A . oil immersion objective and Hamamatsu ORCA - Flash 4 . 0 V2 CMOS camera . The system was integrated with an Asylum Research MFP - 3D - BIO AFM system and placed in a vibrational isolation chamber . AFM scanning of the unroofed cells in PBS solution was conducted at room temperature , under non - contact / AC mode , using Mikromasch CSC381 / Cr - Au cantilevers , with a nominal spring constant of 50pN nm − 1 and a resonance frequency of 14kHz . AFM image analysis was performed in Asylum Research AFM software . The correlative ﬂ uorescence - AFM images were aligned based on the correlation of spots between the two sets of clathrin ﬂ uorescence images to de ﬁ ne ﬁ ducial markers for image registration , and quanti ﬁ ed as described below . Image correlation . Clathrin structures and positions were manually identi ﬁ ed in the EM images by the appearance of the honeycomb lattice . The radius and cen - troid of each object were manually determined by ﬁ tting circles on the clathrin structures until it was completely encompassed . The ultrastructures were qualita - tively categorized as [ 1 ] — ﬂ at , [ 2 ] — shallow curvature , [ 3 ] — medium curvature , [ 4 ] — domed curvature , and [ 5 ] — formed clathrin vesicle , based on the relative shadowing on the edge of the object . Finally , the coordinates of Tq2 - clathrin were obtained by ﬁ tting the spots to a 2D Gaussian , and identifying at least four spots to use as ﬁ ducial markers to generate the 2D af ﬁ ne transformation matrix that minimized the distance between correlated spots . Tilt - series tomography image analysis . The radius and heights of clathrin ultrastructures were quanti ﬁ ed by manually ﬁ tting circles to the xy - sum projection to determine the radius , and drawing an arc along the yz - sum projection of the tomogram to determine the height . Correlative dSTORM - platinum replica transmission electron microscopy . SK - MEL - 2 cells for correlative microscopy in Fig . 1 were obtained from ATCC and were grown in DMEM lacking phenol red ( Life Technologies 31053 - 036 ) and were supplemented with 10 % v / v FBS with 1 % v / v Glutamax ( Life Technologies 35050 - 061 ) , 1 % v / v Penicillin / Streptomycin ( Invitrogen 15070 - 063 ) , and 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Sigma S8636 ) . The cells were transfected with EGFP - clathrin light chain ( a ) using lipofectamine 2000 on day 1 . On day 2 , they were sorted to obtain only GFP - containing cells and plated on coverslips embedded with gold nanoparticles ( hestzig . com , part # 600 - 200AuF ) . The coverslips had been coated with a 1 : 40 solution of ﬁ bronectin ( Sigma F1141 ) in PBS for 30 min . On day 3 , the cells were unroofed and labeled as described below . First , the coverslips were rinsed in stabilization buffer ( 70 mM KCl , 30mM HEPES brought to pH 7 . 4 with KOH , 5 mM MgCl 2 ) for 2 min and unroofed by sonication in 2 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in stabilization buffer . They were then ﬁ xed in 2 % PFA for 20min . After rinsing with PBS , the cells were placed in a blocking buffer ( 3 % bovine serum albumin in PBS ) for one hour . They were then immunolabeled with 11 nM Alexa Fluor 647 - labeled GFP - nanotrap ( preparation described below ) in blocking buffer for 45 min , rinsed in PBS , and post ﬁ xed in 2 % PFA for 20 min . The coverslips were then imaged in a sealed chamber containing blinking buffer ( 10 % w / v glucose , 0 . 8mg mL − 1 glucose oxidase , 0 . 04 mgmL − 1 catalase , and 100 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol made fresh in PBS immediately before imaging ) . dSTORM was performed on a Nikon NSTORM system with 10 kWcm − 2 647 nm laser in TIRF illumination with 30 , 000 10ms frames . A ﬁ nal image was created with Nikon Elements NSTORM analysis software with 5 nm pixel spacing . After imaging , the coverslips were marked with a diamond objective marker ( Leica 11505059 ) . The oil was cleaned off of the coverslip with 80 % ethanol . They were then stored in 2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS and processed for EM the following day . EM processing and imaging was performed as described above . The gold nanoparticles that were embedded in the coverslips were visible in both dSTORM and EM , and were therefore used as spatial ﬁ ducial markers . Three gold nanoparticles were used to map the ﬂ uorescence onto the EM image using an af ﬁ ne spatial transformation and nearest neighbor interpolation . GFP - nanotrap was expressed and puri ﬁ ed as previously described 43 . It was then labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 NHS ester ( ThermoFisher 37573 ) using 2 . 4 molecules of dye for every one nanobody . These were puri ﬁ ed using size exclusion chromatography and concentrated to 11 µ M . SDS - PAGE indicated 1 – 4 dyes per nanobody . All GFP - nanotrap concentrations were estimated assuming an A 280 extinction coef ﬁ cient of 26 , 930 M − 1 cm − 1 . Data availability .
