Reymonta 4 , 30 - 059 Krak´ow , Poland 2 Laboratoire de Physique Th´eorique , Bˆatiment 210 , Universit´e Paris - Sud , 91405 Orsay , France A thorough discussion of the statistical ensemble of scale - free connected random tree graphs is presented . Methods borrowed from ﬁeld theory are used to deﬁne the ensemble and to study analytically its properties . The ensemble is characterized by two global parameters , the fractal and the spectral dimensions , which are explicitly calculated . It is discussed in detail how the geometry of the graphs varies when the weights of the nodes are modiﬁed . The stability of the scale - free regime is also considered : when it breaks down , either a scale is spontaneously generated or else , a ”singular” node appears and the graphs become crumpled . A new computer algorithm to generate these random graphs is proposed . Possible generalizations are also discussed . In particular , more general ensembles are deﬁned along the same lines and the computer algorithm is extended to arbitrary ( degenerate ) scale - free random graphs .

Every time one has some objects or agents in mutual interaction , one can consider these ob - jects or agents as the nodes ( vertices ) of a graph and represent pictorially the existence of the interaction by an abstract link ( edge ) connecting two nodes . Hence , an epidemic can be regarded as a graph : the nodes are the infected people and the links connect those who have been infected with their infectors . Likewise , the science citation index can be represented by a graph . Of course , the world - wide - web is a graph . There are many more such examples . Usually the graph structure is fairly ran - dom . Consider a random graph . Let n denote the degree of a node and P n the corresponding bulk probability distribu - tion . When P n ∼ n − β for n ≫ 1 it is common to call the graphs scale - free . This class of graphs is not described by the classical theory of random graphs [ 1 ] , where P n is Poissonian . The subject is not really new , but it be - came popular recently , when new data on large graphs - in particular on the web network structure [ 2 ] - became available . Scale - free graphs are naturally generated by stochastic processes , where the graph size is growing and the ad - dition of links is preferential : the probability to attach a new link to a node is , roughly speaking , proportional to the node degree . Several models of growing networks have been proposed [ 4 ] - [ 11 ] . The prototype is the model worked out in a classic paper by Simon [ 3 ] . This model does not really deal with graphs , but can easily be con - verted into a ( directed ) graph model , as observed in [ 11 ] . In studying random graphs one can adopt two comple - mentary approaches : - The diachronic approach , where one focuses on the time evolution of the graph . The main advantage of this approach is that one stays close , in spirit at least , to the dynamics operating in Nature . Furthermore , one can dis - cuss processes , like aging , which are intimately related to the time evolution . To our knowledge this approach is the one commonly used in works on scale - free graphs . - The synchronic approach , where one considers the statistical ensemble of graphs at a ﬁxed large time . In - troducing a statistical ensemble enables one to use the conceptual tools of statistical mechanics . The dynamics of processes producing scale - free networks is presumably much more complicated than that of the proposed simple models . The resulting randomness is better implemented in the synchronic than in the diachronic approach . Gen - erating graphs with an a priori given connectivity distri - bution seems also easier . This is the approach adopted in this work . c a b FIG . 1 . Three graphs with the same number of identical nodes and therefore , in our model , with the same weight . A Cayley tree ( a ) has always a diameter ∼ log N , where N = # nodes . A comb - like tree ( b ) has a diameter ∼ N . The generic trees , like ( c ) , are devoid of any symmetry and can be drawn in a variety of manners , ie have large entropy . Such trees made up with nodes of degree one and three have the Hausdorﬀ dimension d H = 2 ( cf [ 12 ] ) and therefore their di - ameter is typically ∼ √ N . Introducing a statistical ensemble of graphs means ipso facto that the graphs are weighted . In our model each graph is given a weight proportional to the product of weights attached to individual nodes and depending on node degrees . The latter weights are chosen so as to gen - erate the scale - free behavior in the ensemble . Thus , in a sense , the graphs - the microstates of the ensemble - 1 are given an ”internal energy” . Our general results char - acterize , of course , the ”typical” graphs only , ie those contributing most signiﬁcantly to the ensemble averages . This can be considered as a virtue or as a ﬂaw of the approach , depending on the goal one is pursuing . The ”typicality” of graphs results from the usual interplay of energy and entropy ( see also Fig . 1 ) . A rather general graph ensemble is deﬁned in Sec . II . For deﬁniteness , we consider undirected graphs only . We use techniques borrowed from ﬁeld theory , which enable one to formulate the problem and to ﬁnd a number of results in a rather elegant fashion . The ensemble is de - ﬁned for a given set of input weights . We rapidly focus on scale - free connected tree graphs , ie connected graphs without cycles . This is the case we have fully under con - trol and where many results can be obtained analytically , so that a maximum clarity is achieved and our approach is exposed the best . We discuss the condition that guar - antees that an a priori given connectivity distribution is found in the ”output” , ie when the weights of graphs and their entropy are taken into account . In Sec . III we show that the ensemble can be in a variety of phases . For each of these phases we calculate two important scaling expo - nents : the fractal and the spectral dimensions . In Sec . IV we discuss what happens when the input weights are modiﬁed . We show that the scale - free regime is unsta - ble . Generically , the ensemble develops two responses : either a scale is spontaneously generated or else a ”sin - gular” node appears , which is connected to almost all other nodes ( the ”one - takes - it - all” scenario ) [ 14 ] . A graph model can be used as an event generator in Monte Carlo studies of the statistical properties of graphs themselves or of the ”matter” ( eg Ising spins , complex spins , etc ) living on the nodes [ 13 ] . Our discussion will also lead to the formulation of a simple computer algo - rithm for generating random graphs . Readers more inter - ested in this aspect of this work than in the more formal discussion to follow can jump directly to Sec . V , where our algorithm is formulated , after reading the beginning of Sec . II to get acquainted with our notation . In Sec . VI we present a sample of curves representing the con - nectivity distributions calculated for ﬁnite systems using our code , compared to the analogous curves generated from the growing network recipe of refs . [ 4 , 8 , 7 ] and we brieﬂy discuss some ﬁnite size eﬀects . In Sec . VII we summarize our results and we discuss the problems related to the generalization of the present approach to models more complicated than the connected tree model discussed at length in the previous sections . We also list some open questions . In this paper , when necessary , we make use of some results , found in a diﬀer - ent context , scattered in earlier publications we have co - authored [ 15 – 18 ] . We believe , that it is useful to adapt these results to the present context , putting them in a new perspective and making them accessible to a diﬀer - ent community . II . MINIFIELD THEORY AND GRAPH ENSEMBLES Our starting idea is to use a toy ﬁeld theory in 0 di - mensions - we call it a miniﬁeld theory - and to identify the Feynman diagrams of this theory with the graphs of our ensemble . The weights attached to the graphs are the amplitudes calculated using the standard Feynman rules , the model being , of course , formulated in such a manner that these weights are positive . Let us deﬁne the miniﬁeld theory [ 17 ] by the following formal integral Z = ( 2 πκλ ) − 12 Z dφ exp 1 κ [ − φ 2 / 2 λ + X n > 0 p n φ n ] ( 1 ) By assumption the real constants p n are non - negative . Hence , strictly speaking , the integral does not exist . However , expanding the second term in the exponential and performing the integrations over φ one obtains an unambiguously deﬁned series . The terms of this series can be represented , as usual in ﬁeld theory , by Feynman diagrams . The convergence of the series is , in general , un - certain and requires some consideration . When the series converges , its sum , also denoted by Z , can be regarded as the partition function of a graph ensemble . 1 2 4 3 2 3 1 4 1 2 4 3 FIG . 2 . The labeled connected Feynman diagrams repre - senting the contributions to the rhs of ( 2 ) . With each one of these graphs is associated the weight 2 [ p 2 λ ] 4 / 3 . The content of the above paragraph will appear obvi - ous to the practitioners of ﬁeld theory , but may appear fortuitous to some readers working on networks , but not totally familiar with the former . We have no space to explain the point at length . Hopefully , a simple example may be of some help . Consider the following contribution to Z : Z example = ( 2 πκλ ) − 12 Z dφ e − 12 κλ φ 2 1 4 ! [ p 2 φ 2 / κ ] 4 ( 2 ) We need to calculate the eighth moment of a Gaussian . We shall do it in a fancy way . For book - keeping purposes we distinguish by a label the four ”interaction terms” that are being multiplied above : [ φ 2 ] 4 → φ ( 1 ) 2 φ ( 2 ) 2 φ ( 3 ) 2 φ ( 4 ) 2 ( 3 ) and we represent each label by a point in a plane . We observe that every moment of a Gaussian is fully deter - mined by its second moment , which in our case equals κλ . We replace all binomials appearing in the integrand , φ ( i ) φ ( j ) → κλ and we join with a line the points repre - senting the labels i and j . The latter results in a speciﬁc 2 graph , a Feynman diagram . The moment to be calcu - lated is obtained by summing over all possible matchings of four pairs of labels . All the connected graphs cor - responding to our example are shown in Fig . 2 . One checks easily that to each of these diagrams correspond 16 distinct matchings of the same four pairs of labels . Thus , the contribution to the rhs of ( 2 ) of each of these Feynman diagrams is λ 4 [ p 2 2 ! ] 4 / 4 ! . The full result is ob - tained by taking into account the disconnected diagrams too . In some diagrams a line connects a point to itself ( i = j ) , these are the so - called ”tadpoles” . We shall not list all these diagrams here . The point is that the Feynman diagrams of the mini - ﬁeld theory are the graphs familiar to people working on networks , except that there is a speciﬁc weight attached to each such a graph . The graphs are not necessarily connected , except if one imposes an appropriate extra constraint , deﬁning a graph sub - ensemble . We assume that p 1 , which plays the role of an external current , is strictly positive . Hence , in our miniﬁeld the - ory there exist graphs with nodes that are ”external” , ie of unit degree . The weight associated with a Feynman diagram that is ”non - degenerate” - ie does not have tadpoles and mul - tiple connections between nodes - and whose nodes are labeled , is weight = κ L − N λ L N ! N Y j = 1 [ p n j n j ! ] ( 4 ) where N and L denote the total number of nodes and links respectively . When tadpoles and / or multiple con - nections are present one has to multiply the rhs by the usual symmetry factors . In graph theory some authors accept the existence of degeneracies in the deﬁnition of what they mean by a graph . In most texts the degenera - cies are excluded . The class of graph models we propose is fairly general , but not the most general . Indeed , by construction the weight of a graph is given in ( 4 ) by a product of weights associated with individual nodes . A possible generalization will be proposed later on . As is well known from ﬁeld theory , W = κ ln Z gener - ates the connected graphs . Only tree graphs survive in the ”semi - classical” limit κ → 0 . From here on we focus on the statistical ensemble of connected tree graphs . We shall return to more general graphs in the last section . In this paper we are interested in models where the ra - dius of convergence of the series in the exponent on the rhs of ( 1 ) is ﬁnite . It is not a loss of generality to set this radius to unity . It is evident from ( 4 ) that this can always be achieved by a multiplicative renormalization of λ and κ . The partition function of connected tree graphs W trees is given by the stationary value of the action at φ = Φ , Φ being deﬁned implicitly by the saddle - point equation Φ = λ X n > 0 t n Φ n − 1 ( 5 ) where we have introduced a shorthand notation t n = np n . One easily checks that Φ = ∂W trees / ∂t 1 ( 6 ) Hence Φ generates tree graphs with one marked exter - nal node . Eq . ( 5 ) with its nice graphical representation [ 12 , 19 ] - see Fig . 3 - has a long history and is recurrently rediscovered in the literature .

The graphical representation of eq . ( 5 ) . With ev - ery node in the ﬁgure - the open circles - is associated the factor λt n . We use the shorthand notation t n = np n . It is easy to see that Φ is singular . Indeed , eq . ( 5 ) can only be satisﬁed if λ is smaller than some critical value λ c = λ c ( t 1 , t 2 , . . . ) . Equation ( 5 ) can be rewritten as λ − 1 = F ( Φ ) ≡ X n > 0 t n Φ n − 2 ( 7 ) and by deﬁnition λ − 1 c = F ( Φ 0 ) ( 8 ) where Φ = Φ 0 is the point in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] where F ( Φ ) takes its minimal value . The critical behavior of the theory is found from the behavior of F ( Φ ) in the vicinity of Φ 0 . One observes that both the rhs of ( 7 ) and its second derivative are positive for Φ > 0 . Moreover , λ c is ﬁnite ( because t 1 > 0 ) . The concavity property of F ( Φ ) im - plies that one has , in general , the choice between only three possibilities ( cf refs . [ 15 , 17 , 12 ] ) : ( A ) Φ 0 < 1 and F ′ ( Φ 0 ) = 0 . ( B ) Φ 0 = 1 and F ′ ( 1 ) = 0 . ( C ) Φ 0 = 1 and F ′ ( 1 ) < 0 . These three cases will be discussed in detail later on . It is customary to introduce a susceptibility critical ex - ponent γ controlling the most singular part of the second derivative of the partition function . Since Φ is the ﬁrst derivative of the partition function , we write Φ ∼ ( λ c − λ ) 1 − γ ( 9 ) The exponent γ is ﬁnite in all cases of interest for us , as will be shown in the following sections , where it will be calculated . A factor λ is associated with every link of a tree graph and has the physical signiﬁcance of the fugacity of links . Since L = N − 1 , it can also be regarded as the fugacity of nodes . Hence 3 W trees = X N W trees N λ N ∼ ( λ c − λ ) 2 − γ ( 10 ) Taking the inverse Laplace transform one obtains for tree graphs the canonical partition function W trees N ∼ N γ − 3 λ − N c N ≫ 1 ( 11 ) Hence , the ensemble of random trees behaves like a stan - dard statistical mechanical ensemble . In particular , the number of trees with N nodes is exponentially bounded in N and the canonical ensemble has an extensive en - tropy . We have not yet introduced the constraints associated with the absence of a scale . The quantity of experimen - tal interest is P n , the bulk connectivity distribution . It is P n which should exhibit a power - like fall at large n . The relevant question is how to choose the series of the bare couplings p n in order to get a given scale - free P n . The rest of this section is devoted to this problem . For tree graphs the solution can be found mapping the model of graphs on another one , known in the literature as the balls - in - boxes model [ 16 ] . In Sec . 2 . 7 . 7 of ref . [ 20 ] a series solution of eq . ( 5 ) is given : Φ = X N Φ N λ N ( 12 ) with Φ N = 1 N X { v j } N ! v 1 ! v 2 ! . . . v N ! t v 1 1 . . . t v N N ( 13 ) and v j being positive integers satisfying the constraints X j v j = N X j jv j = 2 N − 1 ( 14 ) Eq . ( 13 ) can be further rewritten as N Φ N = Ω ( N , 2 N − 1 ) ( 15 ) with Ω ( N , M ) = X { n j } t n 1 . . . t n N δ ( N X j = 1 n j − M ) ( 16 ) The summation is now on all sets of N positive inte - gers . The rhs is the partition function of a system of M balls distributed at random and with weights t n among N boxes , empty boxes being forbidden . This model of weighted partitions is precisely the balls - in - boxes model [ 21 ] . The eﬀective box occupation distribution is t n Ω ( N − 1 , M − n ) / Ω ( N , M ) . Using the integral representation of the ( discrete ) δ - function one easily ﬁnds an integral representation of Ω ( N , M ) , which can be used to calcu - late it by the saddle - point method in the limit N → ∞ , ρ = M / N = const . The eﬀective box occupation distri - bution follows . Of course , the tree graph model corre - sponds to ρ = 2 . We shall not repeat this calculation here , referring the reader to ref . [ 16 ] for details and quot - ing the result for ρ = 2 ≤ h n i t ≡ P n nt n / P n t n : P n ∼ t n Φ n 0 ( 17 ) up to an obvious normalization factor . Here Φ 0 is to be found from F ′ ( Φ 0 ) = 0 . This last condition can be rewritten as X n nt n Φ n 0 / X n t n Φ n 0 = 2 ( 18 ) The lhs is an increasing function of Φ 0 . Consequently h n i t = 2 corresponds to Φ 0 = 1 and therefore to the case ( B ) introduced earlier . Hence , for tree graphs and in the limit N → ∞ P n ∼ t n iﬀ h n i t = 2 ( 19 ) This result can be understood intuitively . The shape of the two distributions , P n and t n , diﬀers because of the constraint s N ≡ 1 N P j n j = 2 . But for N → ∞ the con - straint is satisﬁed ”for free” when h n i t = 2 and β > 2 by virtue of Khintchin’s law of large numbers . The condition ( 19 ) solves our problem : the input couplings p n of the tree - graph model should be set to p n = P n / n in order to get the scale - free connectivity dis - tribution P n in the bulk . The distribution P n must , of course , satisfy the constraint P n nP n = 2 , otherwise it would not refer to trees [ 22 ] . III . GEOMETRY OF SCALE - FREE TREE GRAPHS In this section we discuss the geometry of graphs be - longing to the statistical ensemble of scale - free trees . Hence , according to the results of the preceding section , we assume that t n ∼ n − β for n → ∞ and that h n i t = 2 . We have already stated in the preceding section that this situation corresponds to the case ( B ) : Φ 0 = 1 and F ′ ( 1 ) = 0 . It follows from general arguments that F ( Φ ) has a branch point at Φ = 1 . The order of the singularity is determined by the shape of the tail of t n . For non - integer β one ﬁnds ( cf [ 15 ] ) that [ 23 ] F ( Φ ) = polynomial in ( 1 − Φ ) + ( 1 − Φ ) β − 1 ( 20 ) + higher order terms The concavity of F ( Φ ) implies β > 2 . The linear term in the polynomial is absent . When 2 < β < 3 , inverting eq . ( 21 ) one ﬁnds the singular part of Φ : Φ sing ∼ ( λ c − λ ) 1 / ( β − 1 ) ( 21 ) 4 so that γ = ( β − 2 ) / ( β − 1 ) . When β > 3 the inversion yields Φ sing ∼ ( λ c − λ ) 1 / 2 ( 22 ) Therefore , γ = 1 / 2 . We now consider two scaling exponents which have a direct geometrical interpretation in terms of the average ”dimension” of the ensemble graphs . One can deﬁne a two - point correlation function C ( x , λ ) equal , up to normalization , to the average number of pairs of nodes separated by a distance x . Using a graph - ical representation analogous to that of Fig . 3 one ﬁnds [ 12 ] : C ( x , λ ) ∼ [ λ ∂ ∂ Φ ( Φ F ( Φ ) ] x ( 23 ) The fractal dimension d H of the tree can be deﬁned by x − 1 log C ( x , λ ) = − const ( λ c − λ ) 1 / d H for x → ∞ ( 24 ) where it is assumed that | λ c − λ | ≪ 1 . Notice , that ( λ c − λ ) − 1 is a measure of the average size of a graph [ 24 ] . One ﬁnds ﬁnally d H = 1 γ ( 25 ) Another deﬁnition of dimension is obtained by consid - ering a diﬀusion process on the graph ; as is well known , diﬀusion can be mapped to a random walk . If we consider a walker departing from a certain point at time T = 0 , then the return probability to the start of the walk is , for small T , proportional to T − d s / 2 where d s is the spec - tral dimension : the dimension of the graph as seen by a random walker moving on the graph . In was shown in [ 18 , 25 ] that the spectral dimension d s is for γ ≥ 0 given by d s = 2 1 + γ ( 26 ) Combining ( 26 ) and ( 26 ) one obtains the nice relation d s = 2 d H 1 + d H ( 27 ) For β > 3 one ﬁnds d H = 2 and d s = 4 / 3 . These are the generic values for a tree graph [ 12 , 25 ] , which would be found also if there were only a ﬁnite number of non - vanishing couplings t n . The typical graph is a fully de - veloped tree , with many branching branches . For 2 < β < 3 one obtains : d H = ( β − 1 ) / ( β − 2 ) ( 28 ) d s = 2 ( β − 1 ) / ( 2 β − 3 ) ( 29 ) As β → 2 the trees become increasingly crumpled , they look like a set of linked hedgehogs . As β approaches 2 the average distance between a pair of nodes starts growing very slowly with N . E . g . when β = 2 . 1 this distance is ∼ N 1 / d H = N 1 / 6 . The increase is not logarithmic , as is sometimes claimed , but power - like . Of course , in prac - tice this does not make much diﬀerence , when the power is small . The upshot of the above discussion is that a scale - free large - degree behavior P n ∼ n − β , β > 2 , is associated with a variety of distinct graph geometries . It is quite remarkable , that at least for the tree graphs of the dis - cussed ensemble one can give a complete catalogue of expected geometries . IV . INSTABILITY OF SCALE - FREE REGIME The logical next step of the discussion is to examine what happens when the shape of t n is so distorted that the constraint h n i t = 2 is broken . We continue assuming that t n ∼ n − β at large n . Consider ﬁrst the case h n i t < 2 . This condition is equivalent to F ′ ( 1 ) < 0 . We recover the case ( C ) of Sec . II . Since the linear term in the polynomial on the rhs of ( 21 ) is now present , inverting eq . ( 21 ) one gets Φ sing ∼ ( λ c − λ ) β − 1 ( 30 ) with β > 2 . An explicit calculation using ( 24 ) yields d H = ∞ . We also expect d s = 2 . A typical tree graph looks like a set of linked hedgehogs . Moreover , as ex - plained below , a new feature shows up : a ”singular” node with a ﬁxed degree of O ( N ) , a hedgehog even more spiky than the others . To see this , it is instructive to understand how the con - straint s N = 2 is satisﬁed . Notice that if we omit from s N a few terms , say n j 1 , . . . n j p , the resulting sum will ﬂuctuate around h n i t . Hence , for N → ∞ s N − 1 N ( n j 1 + . . . + n j p ) = h n i t ( 31 ) But since s N = 2 , it is clear that some , at least , of the contributions to the sum on the lhs must be of or - der O ( N ) . Since the probability distribution falls like a power , it is most probable that there is only one such con - tribution . Thus , one expects the appearance of a char - acteristic ”singular” node with degree n = ( 2 − h n i t ) N . Other nodes have degree distribution ∼ t n : P n = t n P k t k + 1 N δ [ n − ( 2 − h n i t ) N ] ( 32 ) The normalization factor in front of δ is determined by the tree condition P n nP n = 2 . The other possible case is h n i t > 2 . This condition is equivalent to F ′ ( 1 ) > 0 , which by virtue of the concav - ity of F ( Φ ) implies that Φ 0 < 1 . This is the case ( A ) 5 of Sec . II . Hence P n equals t n times an exponentially falling factor . A scale in the node order distribution is spontaneously generated . The dramatic ﬂuctuations of node degrees are absent . Expanding F ( Φ ) in the neighborhood of Φ = Φ 0 , where its derivative is bound to vanish and inverting the resulting expansion in order to ﬁnd the most singular part of Φ one gets Φ sing ∼ ( λ c − λ ) 12 ( 33 ) Hence γ = 1 / 2 and one again obtains the generic values d H = 2 and d s = 4 / 3 . The above two scenarios are the only alternatives to the scale - free behavior of the discussed statistical ensem - ble of tree graphs . One can show that the transitions between diﬀerent phases of the model are continuous and that the degree of their softness varies when the couplings t n change . There is no phase transition between the generic phase ( A ) and the scale - free regime ( B ) with β > 3 . V . COMPUTER ALGORITHM In the synchronic approach the construction of graphs does not mimic any real physical process . The empha - sis is on the ﬂexibility and on the eﬃciency in producing a sample of graphs to work with . We use the following notation : R ( n ) = p n / p n − 1 . We propose an algorithm working for a given ﬁxed N and L . It rewires links , generating Feynman diagrams of the miniﬁeld theory , proceeding as follows [ 26 ] : ( a ) Pick a random oriented link ~ ij . ( b ) Pick a random target node k . ( c ) Apply the Metropolis test : rewire the link ~ ij to ~ ik with probability Prob ( rewiring ) = ( n k + 1 ) R ( n k + 1 ) / n j R ( n j ) ( 34 ) when the rhs above is less than unity and with probabil - ity equal to unity otherwise . These Feynman diagrams are properly weighted . The algorithm is probing all possible connections within a set of distinguishable nodes . For non - degenerate diagrams the Metropolis condition immediately follows from the detailed balance equations together with the weight ( 4 ) given to microstates . For general diagrams the symmetry factors , related to the presence of tadpoles and multiple connection between nodes , also come out correctly . This is again a consequence of the detailed balance : if two nodes are connected by m links , the transition to a state where the nodes are connected by m − 1 links can be done in m ways . The inverse operation has only one re - alization . When p n = 1 / n ! the Metropolis test is always positive and the non - degenerate labeled diagrams pro - duced by the algorithm are equiprobable , as they should be . We have checked the validity of the general argument on a variety of examples . In order to produce connected tree graphs , one starts from a connected tree conﬁguration , eg a polyline with free ends and one adds , before the Metropolis test , a check insuring that k 6 = i , j and n i = 1 . It is easy to con - vince oneself that with this constraint the tree is never broken into parts . As explained in Sec . II , the scale - free connectivity distribution in the bulk is obtained setting p n ∼ P n / n . Notice , that with a constraint added before the Metropolis test , the algorithm explores a well deﬁned sub - ensemble of graphs . However , because the detailed balance is satisﬁed , this sub - ensemble is in equilibrium , or , more precisely ﬂuctuates around equilibrium ( see also the remark on that matter in the last section ) . Thus , within the sub - ensemble in question the algorithm tends to sample ”typical” graphs . 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 −10 10 −7 10 −4 10 −1 n Pn β = 3 . 0 β = 2 . 1 FIG . 4 .

NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND FINITE - SIZE EFFECTS Since we propose a new algorithm for generating ran - dom graphs , it may be of interest to the reader to see how our results compare to those obtained with an algorithm already existing on the market . As an example to com - pare with we take the Growing Network model of ref . [ 7 ] , which is a slight generalization of the algorithm proposed originally in ref . [ 4 ] and which also generates connected trees . The asymptotic analytic solution for P n is given by eq . ( 12 ) in the second paper of ref . [ 7 ] ( see also [ 8 ] ) : P n = ( β − 1 ) Γ ( 2 β − 3 ) Γ ( n + β − 3 ) Γ ( β − 2 ) Γ ( n + 2 β − 3 ) ( 35 ) 6 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 −15 10 −10 10 −5 10 0 n Pn β = 3 . 0 β = 2 . 1 FIG . 5 . The connectivity distribution calculated for our en - semble of tree graphs , at ﬁnite N = 2 k , k = 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 and for β = 2 . 1 and 3 . 0 . The almost straight lines correspond to the asymptotic P n given in ( 35 ) . The ﬁgure illustrates the ﬁnite - size cut - oﬀ of the order distribution discussed in the text . We use this P n as input in our code . A sample result is shown in Fig . 4 , where we compare the results of the calculation using the two algorithms , respectively . The calculated points are practically indistinguishable and follow the input distribution , except for those n where ﬁnite - size eﬀects cut and distort the distribution . Indeed , when N is ﬁnite , the distribution of node de - grees cannot extend to inﬁnity , there is an upper cut - oﬀ on n : n < n max . The cut - oﬀ can be estimated by im - posing the condition that the expected number of nodes found above n max is at most equal to unity . Then N ∞ X n max n − β = const ( 36 ) The value of the constant on the rhs depends on the de - tailed shape of P n . Eq . ( 36 ) leads to the scaling law n max ∼ N 1 / ( β − 1 ) ( 37 ) analogous to the result of [ 7 , 9 ] , where instead of N ap - pears the time . Beyond n max the node distribution func - tion falls very abruptly and can be neglected for all prac - tical purposes . Notice , that n max may be much smaller than N . As noticed in ref . [ 9 ] this explains why large scale - free graphs with β signiﬁcantly larger than 3 are not observed in Nature . In Fig . 5 we show the evolution of P n with N . In or - der to obtain a very precise result we use , instead of the Monte Carlo , an analytic recursion formula satisﬁed by the equivalent partition function given by eq . ( 16 ) of Sec . II ( see footnote [ 21 ] in that section ) . When the abscissa in Fig . 5 is rescaled , for diﬀerent N and using ( 37 ) , the curves corresponding to the same β are cut at the same place . VII . SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION A . Connected tree graphs : a tentative summary Let us summarize what has been achieved so far : We have started by introducing a fairly general ensemble of random graphs , but we have rapidly focused our atten - tion on the sub - ensemble of connected tree graphs . We have found the conditions insuring that the latter are scale - free . We have discussed in detail the geometry of the connected tree graphs . We have also constructed a computer algorithm generating these graphs with an ar - bitrary bulk connectivity distribution P n . Since our an - alytic discussion may sound somewhat formal for some readers , let us illustrate it with a simple , but very in - structive example . 1 2 3 4 −2 3 8 13 scale−free crumpled β generic α FIG . 6 . Phase diagram for the simple two parameter model presented in Sec . VII : t 1 = 1 , t n = 1 α n − β , n > 1 . The part of the continuous line on the right of the black dot corresponds to the scale - free graphs belonging to the generic phase . Consider a two - parameter family of input weights t n = np n : t 1 = 1 and t n = 1 α n − β , n > 1 . The condition insuring that the trees are scale - free was found in Sec . II and is h n i t = P n nt n / P n t n = 2 . In the example in question it is equivalent to the following relation between the parameters α and β : α = 1 + ζ ( β − 1 ) − 2 ζ ( β ) ( 38 ) where ζ ( β ) is the Riemann Zeta function . The phase di - agram [ 15 ] is shown in Fig . 6 : the line is calculated from ( 38 ) . As one moves along this line in the direction of decreas - ing β , the geometry remains generic down to β = 3 and becomes progressively more and more crumpled below that point . In particular , the fractal dimension increases from the initial value 2 to ∞ ( see eq . ( 28 ) ) . This be - havior is easily understood . When β is moved towards 2 the convergence of the series deteriorates . The only way to keep the average h n i t constant , viz . equal to 2 , is to 7 reduce the normalization of the tail . This means , how - ever , that the relative weight of nodes with unit degree gets larger . Eventually , the number of ”external” nodes increases with N much faster than the number of large degree nodes . The latter are usually connected to the former , building hedgehog - like structures . Oﬀ the line ( 38 ) one falls into one of the alternative phases discussed in Sec . IV : either a scale is gener - ated spontaneously and P n falls exponentially , or else there appears a ”singular” node with huge connectivity n sing = N ( 2 −h n i t ) . In the former case the graphs have a typical extension ∼ √ N while in the latter case they are crumpled and have inﬁnite fractal dimension . Because of the constant presence of the ”singular” vertex the diam - eter of the graph grows slower than any power of N for N → ∞ . Notice , that the condition β > 2 appears often in our discussion . Indeed , at least in the framework adopted in this paper , a scale - free graph with a diﬀerent exponent cannot exist . Actually , the arguments used towards the end of Sec . IV can also be used when h n i t = ∞ and one predicts an exponentially falling P n at the ”output” . We have considered the stability of scale - free graphs with respect to possible deformations of the sequence of weights . Indeed , in Nature a random graph does not exist in isolation . It is an open system , subject to interactions with , loosely speaking , a heat bath . It is thus interesting to know what is expected to happen when this interaction becomes strong . Our results reﬂect the behavior of ”typical” graphs . But very ”atypical” values of global parameters , for ex - ample of the spectral dimension , can be found when a speciﬁc large graph is analyzed [ 27 ] . Our algorithm makes it possible to measure the degree of this ”atypical - ity” : a numerical simulation enables one to estimate the probability of a given ﬂuctuation of the global parameter . B . More general graph models 1 . Weighted connections Our graph model has been constructed in such a way that the weight of a graph is a product of weights asso - ciated with individual nodes . A possible generalization could consist in replacing the starting graph generating function deﬁned in ( 1 ) by Z ∼ Z d q φ exp 1 κ [ − φAφ + q X n = 1 p n φ nn ] ( 39 ) where A is a positive deﬁnite matrix of rank q and φ = ( φ 1 , . . . , φ q ) . The series expansion of the rhs gener - ates graphs with nodes of degree 1 , 2 , . . . , q and a weight ∝ A − 1 mn attached to every link connecting a pair of nodes of degree m and n . The limit q → ∞ should be handled with care . In a study of tree graphs the limit κ → 0 should be taken ﬁrst . The investigation of this model goes , however , beyond the scope of the present paper [ 28 ] . 2 . Matter on graphs Another generalization would consist in putting ”mat - ter” ﬁelds on graphs . Ising spins on ”small - world” graphs [ 29 ] were already discussed in ref . [ 30 ] . Ising spins liv - ing on the nodes of quenched Feynman diagrams gen - erated by φ 3 or φ 4 interactions were studied by many people ( see , for example , [ 31 ] and the long list of refer - ences therein ) , in particular with the aim to determine the critical behavior of the spin system . It would be very interesting to extend these studies to scale - free graphs as deﬁned in the present paper and to see , for example , what is the eﬀect of changing β and therefore also the fractal dimension of the graphs . 3 . Graphs with cycles The most important generalization consists in extend - ing the study to graphs with cycles . Introduction of a ﬁxed number of cycles does not seem to be a big deal in the present context ( see , however , ref . [ 17 ] ) . For exam - ple , when N → ∞ the Hausdorﬀ dimension is expected to be insensitive to the presence of a ﬁxed number of cy - cles . On the other hand , the case where the ratio L / N is kept ﬁxed at some arbitrary value when N → ∞ is very challenging . There are conceptual problems related to the over - extensive nature of the ensemble . It is not diﬃcult to count the number of non - degenerate graphs with given N and L . It is suﬃcient to consider the number of dis - tinct adjacency matrices C ij = 1 or 0 , for i , j connected or not , respectively : # non - degenerate graphs ( N , L ) = 12 N ( N − 1 ) L ! ( 40 ) In general the rhs behaves like exp ( const N log N ) when N → ∞ , L / N ﬁxed . A similar result is easily obtained for degenerate graphs . The entropy is not extensive . This is easy to understand . It is impossible to divide an arbi - trary graph into two parts separated by a ”boundary” of negligible measure . Any two nodes can interact . Hence , it is not certain , in general , that the bulk distribution P n calculated in the ensemble coincides with that obtained from a single , suﬃciently large graph . Tree graphs are a notable exception : in the ”semiclassical limit” κ → 0 the entropy becomes extensive . Our algorithm , in its most general version , generates all possible Feynman diagrams and can in principle be used to simulate arbitrary graphs . The problem is to ﬁnd the constrains on the couplings p n insuring that the bulk connectivity distribution has a desired form . 8 The presence of the factor ( n k + 1 ) / n j in ( 34 ) means that the rewired nodes are sampled independently of their degree ( without this factor nodes belonging to a large number of links would be rewired preferentially ) . If no extra check is performed before the Metropolis one , the algorithm does not know about the underlying graph structure . It plays with node degrees and nodes as it would play with balls and boxes in the balls - in - boxes model with occupation weights p n . Hence a scale free P n is obtained setting p n ∼ P n ( and L = 12 N h n i P ) . The graphs produced that way are degenerate , there are tad - poles and multiple connections between nodes . They are , in general , not connected - it is very diﬃcult to avoid pro - ducing disconnected graphs - but for β ≤ 3 most of nodes belong to the giant component . The conditions of its ap - pearance are well understood [ 32 , 19 ] . The connectivity distribution within the giant component has the same scale - free behavior at not too small n Our present experience is that the algorithm has no diﬃculty to equilibrate the ensemble . The algorithm de - ﬁnes a Markov process . We do not have any proof that the next - to - largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix is separated from unity by a gap remaining ﬁnite when N → ∞ . But it seems very likely that it is so , since we do not expect any collective eﬀects to occur . A diﬀerent algorithm , generating graphs with an arbi - trary connectivity , is proposed and used in refs . [ 19 , 32 ] . In this algorithm a graph is generated in two steps . First , a list of N degrees , n 1 , n 2 , . . . , n N , is sampled out of the distribution P n . In a sense , one creates ﬁrst N nodes with attached links having the other end free . Then , in the second step , one connects together at random the free ends of links . The produced graph is , in general , not connected and degenerate . The ensemble is deﬁned by repeating this procedure over and over . In the limit N → ∞ the connectivity distribution is identical to P n for individual graphs . Notice , that L = 12 P j n j is not ﬁxed . Our approach , rooted in ﬁeld theory , is diﬀerent . We start with micro - states weighted so that the connectivity distribution becomes scale - free after averaging over the ensemble . But , as already mentioned , the scale - free con - nectivity within individual graphs is , strictly speaking , not guaranteed , except for the ensemble of trees : aver - aging within a single graph of inﬁnite size is , in general , not equivalent to averaging over the ensemble of graphs . This is perhaps a ﬂaw , but on the whole the virtues of the two approaches seem complementary . We hope to develop this point elsewhere . In order to construct non - degenerate graphs it suﬃces to verify , before performing the Metropolis check , that the proposed rewiring does not produce tadpoles and / or multiple connections . We have a code doing that eﬃ - ciently . The real problem , which we have not solved yet , is to ﬁnd for non - degenerate graphs the set of couplings p n producing the desired scale - free bulk distribution P n . Setting p n = P n gives for , say , β = 3 results that are en - couraging , although the cut - oﬀ n max is smaller than in the degenerate case . However , when β is decreased things worsen . No doubt , the problem deserves more theoretical and numerical work . We are tempted to conjecture that the degeneracy does not matter for large scale features of graphs . The ab - sence of any natural scale suggests that the graphs are self - similar . If so , one can decimate nodes as follows : pick a node at random and shrink to a single point all its immediate neighbors . If the graph is really self - similar , decimating nodes should not alter its large scale features . But such a decimation will necessarily produce degener - ate graphs . For the moment , this conjecture is a specu - lation . However , our experience with simulating random surfaces suggests that this possibility should not be dis - regarded : degenerate randomly triangulated surfaces - those whose duals have ”tadpoles” and ”self - energy” in - sertions - turn out to fall into the same universality class as the non - degenerate surfaces , but are much easier to simulate . Finally , let us note that it is straightforward to pro - duce a algorithm analogous to the one proposed in this paper but constructing directed graphs .
