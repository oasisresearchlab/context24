Here we report that these cations stimulate skeleton interoception by promoting prostaglandin E2 secretion from macrophages . This immune response is accompanied by the sprouting and arborization of calcitonin gene - related poly - peptide - α + nerve ﬁ bers , which sense the in ﬂ ammatory cue with PGE 2 receptor 4 and convey the interoceptive signals to the central nervous system . Activating skeleton interoception downregulates sympathetic tone for new bone formation . Moreover , either macrophage depletion or knockout of cyclooxygenase - 2 in the macrophage abolishes divalent cation - induced skeleton interoception . Furthermore , sensory denervation or knockout of EP4 in the sensory nerves eliminates the osteogenic effects of divalent cations .

Over the decades , the regulatory effects of these divalent cations on osteogenesis , osteoclastogenesis , angiogenesis , and immune responses have been gradually revealed 4 – 9 . However , it was not until recently that the involvement of nervous system in the new bone formation induced by divalent metal cations has begun to be realized 10 . So far , it remains unclear whether the central nervous system ( CNS ) , which has emerged to play an important role in bone homeostasis 11 – 14 , participate in this process . The CNS not only reacts to external stimuli , such as temperature , sound , odor , and taste , as exteroception but also receives signals from many phy - siological systems inside the body , including the cardiovascular , respiratory , gastrointestinal , genitourinary systems , and nocicep - tive systems , as interoception . In recent years , the interoceptive processes by which our body senses , interprets , integrates , and regulates signals from peripheral organs have emerged as a key mechanism for the control of internal state of our body by CNS 15 . The interocpetion system consists of ascending neural pathways that transmit the internal body signals to the brain , the CNS where the input interoceptive information is processed , and the descending neural pathways through which the interoceptive signals are circled back to regulate peripheral organs . In addition to the central and peripheral nervous system , several other components , such as the endocrine and immune systems , are proposed to be involved in the interoception process 16 , 17 . Unmyelinated free sensory nerve endings branch throughout tissues to recognize and carry signals related to pain , tem - perature , and mechanical stimuli 18 . As the largest organ , the skeleton accounts for more than 20 % of human body weight . Bone tissues have abundant sensory and sympathetic innerva - tions that connect bones with dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) and the CNS 19 – 21 . The upregulation of sympathetic tone through serotonin and cAMP - response element binding protein ( CREB ) signaling in the hypothalamus contributes to decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption 13 , 22 . We have recently found that CNS senses bone density through prostaglandin E2 ( PGE 2 ) as an ascending interoceptive signal and regulates bone formation through sympathetic nerves as the descending interoceptive pathway 14 . Speci ﬁ cally , PGE 2 secreted by osteo - blasts in response to mechanical loading activates PGE 2 receptor4 ( EP4 ) to stimulate phosphorylation of CREB in hypothalamus , where the tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) expression is downregulated for a sympathetic activity to induce com - mitment of mesenchymal stem / stromal cell ( MSCs ) to osteo - blast lineage . Knockout of the EP4 gene in the sensory nerves or knockout of cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX2 ) in the osteoblastic cells signi ﬁ cantly increased sympathetic activity and reduced bone volume in adult mice . Our studies further demonstrate that ascending skeleton interoceptive signaling target hypothalamus to maintain the balance between bone and fat metabolism 23 , 24 . Moreover , we also showed sensory innervation into porous endplates is responsible for spinal hypersensitivity , thus , low - dose celecoxib maintains skeleton interoception in the endplate , thereby decreasing vertebral endplate porosity and innervation for the treatment of spinal pain 25 , 26 . Importantly , our most recent studies reveal that Skeleton interoception regulates bone and fat metabolism through hypothalamic neuroendocrine hypothalamic neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) ( ref . 1 ) and physiological PGE2 levels maintain skeleton interoception activity for bone homeostasis to reduce vertebral endplate porosity and spinal pain ( ref . 2 ) . Therefore , the skeleton interoception could represent an essential circuit of the CNS in the control of bone metabolism and may shed a light on our understanding of divalent metal cation - induced bone formation . Innate and adaptive immune processes , which become pro - foundly apparent after bone injury , play important roles in bone biology 27 . The presence of a series of immune cell - derived cyto - kines in the early in ﬂ ammatory stage promotes the recruitment of ﬁ broblasts , mesenchymal stem cells , and osteoprogenitor cells from their local niches to initiate bone repair 28 , 29 . For example , PGE 2 , a well - recognized pro - in ﬂ ammatory cytokine that is upregulated only during the initial stage of bone healing , is sug - gested to play an important role in new bone formation . The mutation of the 15 - hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase gene ( HPGD ) , which is responsible for the degradation of PGE 2 30 , plays a major role in promoting tissue regeneration 31 , 32 . Indeed , patients with an HPGD mutation have presented with sub - periosteal new bone formation 33 . Since PGE 2 can elicit primary pain and prolong nociceptor sensitization 34 , 35 , nonsteroidal anti - in ﬂ ammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , which inhibit cyclooxygenase ( COX ) , the limiting enzyme of PGE 2 , have been used to manage post - injury pain . However , there is increasing evidence that the use of NSAIDs , especially selective COX2 inhibitors , can affect bone healing 36 , 37 . These ﬁ ndings suggest that the in ﬂ ammatory molecules produced by the immune system in response to bone injury may serve as biochemical signals to initiate the inter - oceptive control of bone regeneration . In recent years , the immunomodulatory function of orthope - dic biomaterials has been increasingly acknowledged . In fact , the host immune response to implanted biomaterials is now recog - nized as a determinant for the long - term survival and regen - erative function of such biomaterials 38 , 39 . Owing to the central role of macrophages in the immune reaction to bone biomater - ials , as well as their heterogeneity and plasticity , macrophage is one of the most important target cells for immunomodulation in the biomaterial ﬁ eld 39 . Divalent metal cations , such as Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + , have been extensively used to modify ortho - pedic biomaterials since the discovery of their osteogenic effects 8 , 40 – 43 . However , despite their well - recognized roles in the regulation of the immune response 44 , the mechanism through which the divalent cation - modulated immune niche contributes to bone regeneration remains largely unclear . Indeed , the in vitro effects of divalent metal cations on osteogenesis starkly contra - dict our ﬁ ndings in a more complex in vivo model , because their osteogenic effects on the well - orchestrated bone healing process may involve the interplay of multiple systems in our body . We have recently showed the essential role of early in ﬂ ammatory response in Mg 2 + - induced new bone formation , as Mg 2 + sti - mulates macrophage via transient receptor potential cation channel member 7 ( TRPM7 ) to create a pro - osteogenic immune microenvironment 7 . Since the effective window of Mg 2 + coin - cides with the reinnervation phase of bone healing 45 , we hypo - thesize the communication between the immune system and the neural system can trigger the skeleton interoception for the regulation of new bone formation . In this study , we sought to characterize the mechanism for divalent cation - induced bone formation . We found that divalent metal cations , including Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + , activated skeletal interoception through the immune - neural axis to initiate CNS regulation of bone formation . During the early stage of bone healing , divalent cation - induced PGE 2 secretion from macro - phages stimulated EP4 in the sensory nerves . Importantly , the sprouting and arborization of sensory nerves in response to macrophage - derived PGE 2 transmitted interoceptive signals to the CNS to tune down sympathetic tone through hypothalamic CREB signaling , resulting in increased osteogenesis and decreased osteoclastogenesis in the injured bone .

Results Divalent cation - induced bone formation . To investigate the effect of metallic divalent cations including Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , or Cu 2 + on bone formation , we used an alginate - based hydrogel to facil - itate the temporary and localized delivery of these divalent cations in mouse femurs ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) after evaluating their cytotoxicity in vitro ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Pure alginate ( Alg ) or divalent cation - releasing alginate ( i . e . , Mg – Alg , Cu – Alg , and Zn – Alg ) was placed in a tunnel defect drilled from the patello - femoral groove of the distal femur along the axis of the femoral shaft . Micro - computed tomography ( µCT ) analysis showed a substantial increase in bone volume fraction ( BV / TV ) , bone mineral density ( BMD of TV ) , and polar moment of inertia ( ρ MOI ) in the femur 4 weeks after the placement of divalent cation – releasing alginate compared with the pure alginate - treated control mice ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Particularly , cortical bone area ( Ct . Ar ) , cortical bone thickness ( Ct . T ) , and bone perimeter ( B . Pm ) were greater in the divalent cation - treated group compared with the controls ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . We found a similar trend in the increase of trabecular thickness ( Tb . T ) in the femurs treated with Mg 2 + or Cu 2 + , although it was less pronounced ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) .

Moreover , immuno - ﬂ uorescent staining revealed that the number of osteocalcin + ( OCN + ) osteoblasts increased signi ﬁ cantly on the endocortical and periosteal surfaces of femurs treated with Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , or Cu 2 + ( Fig . 1d , f ) . Meanwhile , the number of tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase + ( TRAP + ) cells on the endocortical and peri - osteal surfaces decreased signi ﬁ cantly in the divalent cation - treated femurs compared with the controls ( Fig . 1e , f ) . In parti - cular , the number of osterix + and Runx2 + osteoprogenitors in the periosteum was also signi ﬁ cantly higher after the release of Mg 2 + from the hydrogel ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) . Further - more , using ﬂ uorochrome labeling , we showed that the release of divalent cations , including Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + , contributed to a signi ﬁ cantly higher rate of mineral deposition , as manifested by an increased ﬂ uorochrome ( i . e . , calcein and xylenol ) intensity and an increased distance between the two ﬂ uorochrome labels ( Fig . 1g – i and Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . We also con ﬁ rmed that the delivery of divalent cations didn ’ t lead to any histological alteration in the spleen , liver , kidney , and heart tissues at either the early ( week 1 , Supplementary Fig . 3a ) and later stage ( week 4 , Supplementary Fig . 3b ) of the bone healing process . Therefore , our results reveal that divalent cations , including Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + , could stimulate periosteal new bone formation . Divalent cation - induced PGE2 production from macrophages . To examine the mechanism of divalent cation - induced bone formation , we ﬁ rst characterized the immune response around the divalent cation - releasing alginate , because new bone forma - tion in the periosteum can be evidenced by µCT and H & E staining ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) at early in ﬂ ammatory stage of bone healing ( i . e . , day 7 after the injury ) . The majority of immune cells present at this key stage of new bone formation were found to be F4 / 80 + CD68 + macrophages rather than CD11c + dendritic cells , CD19 + B - cells , or CD3 + T - cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . We demonstrated that the number of CD68 + macrophages increased signi ﬁ cantly in the bone marrow and periosteum of divalent cation - treated femurs compared with controls ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Co - immunostaining of COX2 with CD68 demonstrated that COX2 was expressed primarily in CD68 + macrophages in the periosteum ( Fig . 2a ) , and that the stimulation of divalent cations , including Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , or Cu 2 + , signi ﬁ cantly increased expression of COX2 in CD68 + macro - phages in the callus ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Indeed , the release of Mg 2 + signi ﬁ cantly elevated PGE 2 con - centration in bone ( Fig . 2c ) and serum ( Fig . 2d ) during the early stage ( i . e . , week 1 ) , when the injured site was undergoing acute in ﬂ ammation . To examine the mechanism of divalent cation - induced COX2 expression , we isolated and cultured the primary mouse bone marrow macrophages ( BMM ) with the divalent cations . Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + all promoted secretion of PGE 2 ( Fig . 2e ) . Importantly , when used at a speci ﬁ c level ( i . e . , 0 . 1 mM Zn 2 + , 0 . 1 mM Cu 2 + , or 10 mM Mg 2 + ) , the divalent cations upregulated prostaglandin E synthase ( PTGES ) gene expression ( Fig . 2f ) and protein levels of COX2 in the BMM ( Fig . 2g ) without affecting cell viability ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . We also veri ﬁ ed these ﬁ ndings by sorting macrophages in LysM - YFP mice for RT - qPCR assay after the placement of divalent cation - releasing alginate . Our data showed Mg – Alg , Cu – Alg , and Zn – Alg all contributed to signi ﬁ cantly upregulated expression of PTGES and COX2 ( Fig . 2h ) . Furthermore , divalent cations led to the phos - phorylation of nuclear factor - κ B ( NF - κ B ) p65 and inhibitor of nuclear factor - κ B ( I κ B α ) , the key cascade proteins in the NF - κ B signaling pathway ( Fig . 2i ) . Indeed , Mg 2 + signi ﬁ cantly increased the binding of NF - κ B p65 to the COX2 gene promoter as shown in chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay ( Fig . 2j ) . Thus , we showed that divalent cations stimulate the secretion of PGE 2 from macrophages during the in ﬂ ammation stage of the bone healing process . Ablation of COX2 in macrophages eliminates periosteal bone formation . To validate the mechanism in vivo , we established an inducible macrophage - depleted mouse model by crossing LysM - Cre mice with iDTR wt mice . Macrophage depletion was effec - tively achieved in iDTR LysM + / − mice by injecting diphtheria toxin ( DTX ) . Macrophage depletion diminished the effect of Mg 2 + on bone healing , as there was no signi ﬁ cant difference between the Mg – Alg group and the control group in bone formation on µCT ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Fig . 6a ) , whereas , Mg 2 + - releasing hydrogel effectively promoted new bone formation after bone injury in LysM - Cre mice , similar to its effect in WT mice . Interestingly , when bone PGE 2 level was elevated with injection of SW03329 ( a PGE 2 degradation enzyme inhibitor ) , the new bone formation in the injured femur improved signi ﬁ cantly in both the control group and the Mg – Alg group ( Fig . 3c , d and Supple - mentary Fig . 6b ) . Speci ﬁ cally , new bone formation at the per - ipheral cortex of the injured femur with injection of SW033291 in the control group was similar in the Mg 2 + - treated group on H & E staining ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . Moreover , the numbers of OCN + osteoblasts and TRAP + osteoclasts on the endocortical and periosteal surfaces of femurs were similar regardless of the pre - sence of Mg 2 + in the alginate with injection of SW033291 ( Supplementary Fig . 6d , e ) . We further generated mice with conditional COX2 knockout in the macrophages ( COX2 LysM − / − ) by crossing COX2 wt mice with LysM - Cre mice . Mg 2 + - releasing hydrogel failed to induce thickening of cortical bone in injured femurs of COX2 LysM − / − mice compared with COX2 wt mice ( Fig . 3e , f and Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . Mg 2 + - induced new bone formation at the peripheral cortex of femurs in COX2 wt mice was not seen in COX2 LysM − / − mice on H & E staining ( Fig . 3g ) . Again , the effect of Mg 2 + on OCN + osteoblasts and TRAP + osteoclasts on both endocortical and periosteal surfaces was diminished in COX2 LysM − / − mice ( Fig . 3g , i ) . These data show that COX2 in macrophages is responsible for PGE 2 production for divalent cation – induced bone formation . Sensory nerves are essential for divalent cation – induced bone formation . Given that PGE 2 activates EP4 in the sensory nerve to maintain skeletal interoception activity , we examined whether sensory nerves are associated with divalent cation - induced bone formation . Prominent sprouting and arborization of calcitonin gene - related polypeptide - α + ( CGRP + ) sensory nerve ﬁ bers coursing longitudinally over the outer periphery of the reactive callus were observed in immunostaining of periosteum ( Fig . 4a ) . The intensity of CGRP + nerve ﬁ bers in the periosteum was sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased with divalent cations ( Fig . 4b ) . Importantly , terminal dendrites of CGRP + sensory nerves were spatially associated with CD68 + macrophages in the reactive periosteum ( Fig . 4c ) . Moreover , the expression of CGRP was signi ﬁ cantly increased in the ipsilateral DRG of mice treated with divalent cations ( Fig . 4d – f ) . Interestingly , CGRP + dendrite sprouting observed primarily around COX2 + macrophages in the perios - teum of COX2 wt mice treated with divalent cations was missing from COX2 LysM − / − mice ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . We then created a sensory denervation mouse model ( TrkA Avil − / − ) by crossing sensory nerve - speci ﬁ c Cre ( Advillin - Cre ) mice with nerve growth factor receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase A ( TrkA ) ﬂ oxed ( TrkA wt ) mice to con ﬁ rm the essential role of sensory nerve in divalent cation - induced bone formation . Indeed , Mg 2 + signi ﬁ cantly increased the density of CGRP + sensory nerve ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28203 - 0 4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 13 : 535 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28203 - 0 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 0 1 2 3 4 0 2 4 6 8 0 1 2 3 a 1000 1200 1400 1600 S e r u m P G E 2 ( pg / m L ) * * n . s . 1w 4w 40 60 80 100 B o n e P G E 2 ( pg / m g · p r o t e i n ) * * * * 1w 4w c Alg ( n = 6 ) Mg - Alg ( n = 8 ) C t l M g 2 + C t l M g 2 + C O X 2 Input NF - κB p65 G AP D H f d i C O X 2 CD 68 H oe c h s t Cu - Alg Alg Mg - Alg Zn - Alg e C T L 0 . 5 5 10 20 0 . 1 0 . 5 0 . 1 0 . 5 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 conc .

Similarly , Mg 2 + stimulated bone formation in TrkA wt mice , and such effects were eliminated in TrkA Avil − / − mice ( Fig . 4h , i and Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . Taken together , divalent cation - induced sensory inner - vation in injured bone tissue is essential for new bone formation . Divalent cations stimulate PGE 2 / EP4 skeleton interoception in downregulation of sympathetic activity . We have shown that PGE 2 activates sensory nerves via EP4 to induce phosphorylation of CREB in the VMH of the hypothalamus as a skeletal interoception pathway 22 , 46 . We , therefore , investigated whether local delivery of divalent cations could trigger CREB phosphor - ylation in the hypothalamus . Immunostaining of brain sections showed that phosphorylation of CREB was signi ﬁ cantly increased in the contralateral VMH of mice at 1 week after the delivery of Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , or Cu 2 + in the injured femurs ( Fig . 5a , b ) . CREB phosphorylation in the hypothalamus with upregulation in 5 - hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C ( HTR2C ) was con ﬁ rmed by Western blot analysis ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Moreover , using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , we showed that Mg 2 + signi ﬁ cantly reduced epinephrine levels in serum and urine compared with controls , indicating suppression of sympathetic tone in Mg – Alg - injected mice ( Fig . 5e ) .

The density of TH + sympathetic nerve ﬁ bers on the periosteal surface of divalent cation - treated femurs was signi ﬁ cantly less in mice injected with divalent cation - releasing alginate compared with the controls ( Fig . 5f ) . In parallel , spontaneous activity of mice , an indicator of sympathetic tone and postoperative pain 26 , was assessed by spontaneous activity wheels . Compared with controls , the release of Mg 2 + contributed to signi ﬁ cantly shorter daily distance and duration , as well as lower maximum speed of running - wheel activity at weeks 1 and 4 after surgery ( Fig . 5g ) . Finally , we examined the effect of divalent cations on the activation of skeletal interoception in TrkA Avil − / − and COX2 LysM − / − mice , as well as their WT littermates . With sensory nerve denervation , the effect of Mg 2 + on phosphorylation of CREB was diminished compared with their WT littermates ( Fig . 5h ) .

EP4 expression in primary DRG neurons was increased more than 10 - fold relative to treatment with Mg 2 + alone ( Fig . 6a ) . We then generated EP4 Avil − / − mice by crossing Advillin - Cre mice with EP4 wt mice . Mg 2 + - induced bone formation was abolished in EP4 Avil − / − mice with induction of EP4 ablation in the sensory nerves , as shown by µCT ( Fig . 6b , c and Supplementary Fig . 7d ) . We con ﬁ rmed with H & E staining that the new bone formation induced by Mg 2 + at the peripheral cortex was diminished with conditional knockout of EP4 in sensory nerve ﬁ bers ( Fig . 6d ) . Moreover , the increase of osteo - blasts in the periosteum and decrease of osteoclasts were diminished in EP4 Avil − / − mice after postoperative administration of Mg 2 + ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) . Again , as in COX2 ablation mice , the effect of Mg – Alg on the daily distance and duration of running - wheel activity was also abolished in EP4 Avil − / − mice ( Fig . 6e ) . Importantly , phosphorylation of CREB in the hypo - thalamus was not detectable in EP4 Avil − / − mice treated with Mg – Alg , unlike their EP4 Avil − / − littermates ( Fig . 6f ) . To validate the hypothesis that downregulation of sympathetic activity mediates Mg 2 + - induced cortical bone thickening , we injected mice with propranolol , a widely used β 2 - adrenergic antagonist . Propranolol contributed to signi ﬁ cantly more perios - teal new bone formation in Mg 2 + – Alg - injected femurs compared with the vehicle group , whereas it failed to increase bone formation in Alg - treated femurs relative to the vehicle group ( Fig . 6g , h and Supplementary Fig . 8c ) . The bone that was newly formed in response to the stimulation of Mg 2 + after the administration of propranolol was located primarily at the peripheral cortex , as was previously observed in WT mice ( Fig . 6i ) . Moreover , mice injected with propranolol had a shorter duration of running - wheel activity regardless of Alg or Mg – Alg treatment ( Fig . 6j ) . Interestingly , the activation of CREB phosphorylation observed in the contralateral VMH was not prominent after the injection of SW033291 ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) , suggesting that the local stimulation caused by the Mg 2 + - induced release of PGE 2 from macrophages was largely masked by the systematic administration of SW033291 . Similarly , the decrease in spontaneous activity caused by Mg – Alg relative to Alg was diminished as the distance and duration of running - wheel activity in Alg treated mice were lower after the injection of SW033291 ( Supplementary Fig . 8e ) . Therefore , EP4 in the sensory nerves mediates the activation of skeletal interoception to downregulate sympathetic activity , leading to new bone formation in the injured site . Discussion In recent years , rapid progress has been made in the development of novel biodegradable metal implants 10 , 48 . With controlled degradation kinetics and gradual integration with bone tissue , biodegradable metal implants have been demonstrated to be superior to traditionally used bioinert metal implants for the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries . Particularly , these biode - gradable implants can induce new bone formation through the release of various divalent metal cations 10 , 48 . Moreover , given the promising osteogenic properties of these divalent metal cations , they are also widely used for the modi ﬁ cation of various kinds of orthopedic biomaterials 8 , 41 , 49 . Indeed , compared with expensive biological therapeutic agents and complex surgical procedures , the intervention using divalent cations appears to be a cost - effective way to achieve bone regeneration . However , it remains largely unclear how divalent cations induce new bone formation and whether these divalent cation - releasing biomaterials also induce bone formation through similar molecular and cellular mechanisms . In this study , we discovered that the divalent cations , Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + serve as interoceptive signals to initiate CNS regulation of new bone formation after injury , which suggests the complexity of the underlying mechanism for divalent cation - induced bone regeneration has been greatly under - estimated . Therefore , we believe that a clear understanding of the mechanism through which these divalent cations contribute to new bone formation through interoception will greatly bene ﬁ t the development of novel biomaterials to fully elicit the therapeutic potential of these divalent cations . The immune system and the nervous system are paramount to sense and respond to changes in our body , as they possess unique qualities that enable them to counter deviations in the internal environment 16 . Upon the delivery of divalent cations , which disrupts the homeostasis in bone microenvironment , the acute immune response contributes to a series of in ﬂ ammatory che - mokines and cytokines that relay information to the nervous system to initiate interoceptive control of bone formation . As a hallmark of in ﬂ ammatory response after bone injury , COX2 / PGE 2 plays a key role in cortical bone repair 33 , 36 , 37 . Subcutaneous administration of PGE 2 contributes to new bone formation on the endocortical and periosteal surfaces of ovariectomized and intact rats 50 , whereas global knockout of COX2 almost eliminates of periosteal bone formation during bone healing 51 . In this study , we showed divalent cations , including Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + , sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased PGE 2 production from CD68 + macrophages in the reactive periosteum . Interestingly , PGE 2 activated EP4 signaling in the CGRP + sensory nerve endings as the bio - chemical interoceptive signal . Moreover , our data showed that the injection of SW03329 elevated PGE 2 concentration in the control group to support cortical bone formation but did not further signi ﬁ cantly promote Mg 2 + - induced periosteal new bone for - mation . This implies that PGE 2 - EP4 signaling in skeletal inter - oception is not entirely concentration - dependent , and there might be a speci ﬁ c window of PGE 2 levels for the activation of the immune - neural axis during bone healing — if so , this warrants further investigation . This observation suggests that secretion of PGE 2 speci ﬁ cally by macrophages stimulates divalent cations - induced bone formation through skeleton interoception . Although the immunomodulatory effects of divalent cations have been reported , the in ﬂ ammatory responses induced by these divalent cations don ’ t always produce speci ﬁ c in ﬂ ammatory cytokines ( e . g . , PGE 2 ) to facilitate new bone formation 52 – 55 . Instead , the immunomodulatory effects of these divalent cations are highly concentration - dependent and tissue - speci ﬁ c . More - over , as bone tissue is the major reservoir for minerals in human body , the in ﬂ ammation in this microenvironment induced by high levels of divalent cations may initiate the deposition of these trace minerals in hard tissue to alleviate their potential long - term toxicity . Therefore , the storage exogenous divalent cations in newly formed bone tissue could be an effective and ef ﬁ cient strategy to maintain the physiological condition in bone micro - environment . In this study , by utilizing the different cross - linking potential of Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + on alginate 56 , Mg – Alg , Zn – Alg , and Cu – Alg were designed exquisitely to harness the immunomodulatory effects of these divalent cations on macro - phages . For instance , Zn 2 + and Cu 2 + released at a very low level ( i . e . , approximately 0 . 1 mM ) , which is also seen in either zinc or copper implants with slow degradation rate , produced PGE 2 without eliciting cytotoxicity . In comparison , 10 mM of Mg 2 + released from Mg - alginate , similar to that from degradable magnesium - based implants 57 , stimulated the production of PGE 2 from macrophages , though Mg 2 + has been recognized as an anti - in ﬂ ammatory agent due to its suppressive effects on pro - in ﬂ ammatory molecules 58 , 59 . The immunomodulatory effects of the divalent cations were also shown manifested by the activation of the NF - κ B signaling pathway in BMM . Given that Mg 2 + promotes the nuclear translocation of NF - κ B p65 in binding to ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28203 - 0 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 13 : 535 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28203 - 0 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications COX2 promoter , it is anticipated that the NF - κ B signaling pathway , which is crucial in in ﬂ ammation responses 60 , may play a central role in divalent cation - induced regulation of PGE 2 . Although many of the in ﬂ ammatory cytokines , such as IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , and TNF - α , can be recognized by their receptors expressed in the sensory nerve to modulate the nervous system 61 , PGE 2 , among all in ﬂ ammatory mediators , tends to receive the most attention due to its role in mediating peripheral pain pathway 62 . By using a primary culture of DRG neurons and the mice with conditional knockout COX2 in macrophage , we demonstrated that the activation of sensory neurons is actually triggered by the macrophage - derived PGE 2 in response to the stimulation of divalent cations . Moreover , the ablation of EP4 in sensory nerves abolished the osteogenic effect of Mg 2 + in the periosteum , thus showing that the crosstalk between immune and neural system is essential in skeletal interoception - mediated new bone formation . The density of sensory and sympathetic ﬁ bers in the perios - teum remains the highest in the skeletal system 21 . The periosteum covers almost the entire bone surface and is one of the most regenerative tissues for skeletal osteogenesis 63 . Damage of the periosteum severely impairs cortical bone homeostasis 64 , 65 and bone fracture healing 10 , 65 . Moreover , an increase in the density of sensory and sympathetic nerve ﬁ bers in injured bone tissue has been reported to contribute to the bone healing process 45 , 66 , 67 . The sprouting and arborization of sensory nerve ﬁ bers in the periosteum in response to bone injury 45 or mechanical stimulation 68 may facilitate the sensation of stimuli and the initiation of osteogenesis . CGRP + sensory nerves that emanate from the DRG of the spinal cord detect multiple stimuli in bone tissues ( including in ﬂ ammatory cytokines ) and process and relay these signals to higher CNS levels 69 . In addition to its major role as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator , CGRP is also con - sidered a peptide that can be released from the peripheral nerve terminals to regulate osteoclast and osteoblasts 70 , 71 , which was recently reported to be implicated in the new bone formation induced by pure magnesium implant 10 . In our study , a con - spicuous increase in the number of CGRP + nerve ﬁ bers in divalent cation - treated femurs suggests an association between the activation of sensory afferents and the in ﬂ ammatory micro - environment , which is indispensable in skeleton interoceptive circuit . Therefore , the upregulation of CGRP in response to divalent cations may possess multiple functions , including the nociceptive transmission contributing to central sensitization and the direct control of bone cells through the receptors they shared . The spiral - like TH + sympathetic nerve ﬁ bers typically wrap around the major blood vessels in the periosteum and penetrate the cortical bone via Volkmann ’ s and Haversian canals 72 , 73 . They are known to be capable of regulating osteoblast activity through β 2 - adrenergic receptors ( β 2AR ) 13 , 74 . Meanwhile , by increasing the secretion of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa - B ligand ( Rankl ) from osteoblasts , the sympathetic nervous system can also stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption 12 , 75 . We found that PGE 2 produced by divalent cation - stimulated macrophages tunes down sympathetic activity for the differentiation of OCN + osteoblasts on the endocortical and periosteal surfaces . Moreover , in both the macrophage depletion and sensory denervation models , elevated PGE 2 in the periosteum failed to trigger the activation of CREB signaling in the VMH or periosteal new bone formation , indicating that the macrophage - mediated immune response and the sensation of afferent nerves are indispensable in the CNS recognition of stimulation from Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , or Cu 2 + after bone injury . Importantly , CREB signaling in the ipsilateral DRG and the contralateral VMH by periosteal delivery of divalent cations downregulates sympathetic activity as a precise temporal - spatial feedback to the injured site for bone regeneration , as the bone homeostasis of the contralateral femur was not altered after the activation of skeletal interoception ( Supplementary Fig . 9a – c ) . The discovery of the skeleton interoception - mediated new bone formation triggered by Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , and Cu 2 + indicates that the complexity of the underlying mechanism for the osteo - genic effects of these divalent cations has been greatly under - estimated . Nevertheless , it is important to note that there have been multiple approaches reported in the past few decades through which these divalent cations may modulate bone homeostasis 6 – 9 . And this may explain the difference among the three tested divalent cations in term of their bone formation outcome . For instance , in our study , the highest bone volume was observed in the Cu – Alg group , as the old bone was barely resorbed from the endosteal surface by osteoclasts following the new bone formation on periosteal surface . In fact , from as early as 1981 , Cu 2 + has been reported to have a direct dose - dependent inhibitory effect on osteoclastic activity 76 . Cu 2 + has also been used in biomaterials to shift the equilibrium between bone for - mation and bone resorption because the tolerance of osteoclasts and osteoblasts to Cu 2 + differs 77 , 78 . In addition to the bone cells , some divalent cations like Mg 2 + and Zn 2 + have also been shown to facilitate type H vessel formation by targeting endothelial cells , which couples angiogenesis with osteogenesis during bone healing 6 . This subtype of vessels , characterized by the co - expression of CD31 and endomucin , can provide niche signals for perivascular osteoprogenitors to promote osteogenesis 79 , 80 . Recent studies showed the sensory innervation following bone injury is an essential upstream mediator for vasculature 45 , and electrical stimulation at DRG could promote type - H vessel for - mation to enhance bone regeneration 81 . Therefore , it would be interesting to further explore to which extend are angiogenesis and vasculogenesis involved in skeleton interoception and what their speci ﬁ c role may be in divalent cation - induced new bone formation . In summary , we found that skeletal interoception mediates divalent cation - induced bone formation ( Fig . 6K ) . The controlled delivery of Mg 2 + , Zn 2 + , or Cu 2 + stimulates to the production of PGE 2 from CD68 + macrophages , which is followed by rapid reinnervation of CGRP + sensory nerve ﬁ bers in the reactive periosteum . Activation of EP4 receptor in sensory nerves by local PGE 2 induces CREB signaling in the VMH as an ascending interoceptive signal , which downregulates sympathetic activity as a descending interoceptive signal to induce osteogenesis at the injured bone treated with divalent cations . The discovery of divalent cation - induced bone formation through skeletal inter - oception could revolutionize the current understanding of bone regeneration and inspire innovative orthopedic biomaterials for bone tissue engineering .

Twenty percent alginate gel ( Alg ) was prepared by mixing sodium alginate powder ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA , 180947 ) in deionized water , while 10 % magnesium chloride ( MgCl 2 , Sigma - Aldrich , M8266 ) , 10 % zinc chloride ( ZnCl 2 , Sigma - Aldrich , 208086 ) , and 10 % copper chloride ( CuCl 2 , Sigma - Aldrich , 307483 ) were used for the preparation of magnesium cross - linked alginate ( Mg – Alg ) , zinc cross - linked alginate ( Zn – Alg ) , and copper cross - linked alginate ( Cu – Alg ) . Twelve - week - old male mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine ( Vetalar , Ketaset , Ketalar ; 75 mg / kg , intraperitoneally ) and xylazine ( Rompun , Sedazine , AnaSed ; 10 mg / kg , intraperitoneally ) . A longitudinal incision was made at the left knee and the patella was dislocated to expose the femoral condyle . Using a 20 - gauge needle ( Becton , Dickinson and Company , BD Syringe , 309644 ) , we created a tunnel with a diameter of 1mm from the patello - femoral groove of the distal femur along the axis of the femoral shaft . After thorough irrigation with saline ( Quality Biological Inc , 114055101 ) , either pure alginate or divalent cation - releasing alginate ( 0 . 01 mL ) was injected into the femoral canal . Meanwhile , a same tunnel defect was created in the right femur , but no material was injected . The wounds were sutured layer - by - layer , and the mice were housed in a speci ﬁ c - pathogen - free facility after the surgery . A monocyte - macrophage lineage depletion mouse model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of diphtheria toxin ( DTX , Sigma - Aldrich , D0564 ) in iDTR LysM + / − mice every other day during the week before and the week after the surgery . A PGE 2 degradation enzyme inhibitor , SW033291 ( Selleck Chemicals , Houston , TX , USA ) , was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 10 mg / kg every day for 1 week after the surgery . A low - dose β - adrenergic receptor blocker , propranolol ( PROP , Sigma - Aldrich , 1576005 ) , was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 0 . 5mg / kg every day for 1 week after the surgery . µ CT analysis . At designated time points , the femurs were harvested from the mice and ﬁ xed overnight using 4 % paraformaldehyde . Analysis was performed using a high - resolution µCT scanner ( SkyScan 1275 , Bruker , Kontich , Belgium ) . The vol - tage of the scanning procedure was 65 kv with a 153 - μ A current . The resolution was set to 8 . 7 μ m per pixel . Two phantom - contained rods with a standard density of 0 . 25 and 0 . 75g / cm 3 were scanned with each sample for calibration . Data reconstruction was completed using NRecon software ( v1 . 6 , SkyScan ) , data analysis was accomplished using CTAn software ( v1 . 9 , SkyScan ) , and 3D model visuali - zation was performed using CTvox software ( v3 . 2 , SkyScan ) .

Two ﬂ uorochrome labels were used sequentially to eval - uate periosteal new bone formation rate after the placement of divalent cation releasing alginate . In brief , calcein green ( 5 mg / kg , Sigma - Aldrich , C0875 ) was subcutaneously injected into mouse femora one week after the surgery , while xylenol orange ( 90 mg / kg , Sigma - Aldrich , 52097 ) was injected two weeks after the surgery . The ﬂ uorochrome labels were visualized under a ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Niko ECL IPSE 80i , Japan ) . The intensity of ﬂ uorescence and the distance between two labeling were measured and analyzed by ImageJ software ( NIH , USA ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescence and histomorphometric analysis . At designated time points , mice femurs were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , SF100 - 4 ) overnight and decalci ﬁ ed with 10 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( pH = 7 . 4 ) for 21 days . For immunostaining , the samples were dehydrated in 20 % sucrose solution with 2 % polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP , Sigma - Aldrich , PVP40 ) for 24 h and embedded in 8 % gelatin ( Sigma - Aldrich , 1288485 ) supplemented with 20 % sucrose ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , S5 - 500 ) and 2 % PVP . 40 μ m - thick coronal - oriented sections of the femurs were obtained using a cryostat microtome . For histomor - phometry , the samples were dehydrated in ethanol , embedded in paraf ﬁ n , and prepared into 5µm - thick coronal - oriented sections using a rotary microtome . The brain and DRG tissues harvested from the mice were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraf - ormaldehyde , dehydrated with 30 % sucrose , and embedded in an optimal cutting temperature compound ( OCT , Sakura Finetek , Torrance , CA , USA , 4583 ) . 10 μ m - thick coronal - oriented sections of the brain and DRG were obtained using a cryostat microtome . Immunostaining was performed using a standard protocol . Brie ﬂ y , the sections of the brain and DRG were incubated with primary antibodies to mouse OCN ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK , ab93876 , 1 : 200 ) , CD68 ( Abcam , ab31630 , 1 : 400 ) , CGRP ( Abcam , ab81887 , 1 : 300 ) , PGP9 . 5 ( Abcam , ab108986 , 1 : 300 ) , COX2 ( Abcam , ab15191 , 1 : 200 ) , CREB ( Abcam , 178322 , 1 : 200 ) , p - CREB ( Abcam , ab32096 , 1 : 200 ) , and TH ( Millipore Sigma , Burlington , MA , USA , AB152 , 1 : 100 ) overnight at 4 °C . Alexa - Fluor 488 - conjugated and Alexa - Fluor 647 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Waltham , MA , USA ) were used for immuno ﬂ uorescent staining , while the nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33324 ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescent images were captured using an LSM 780 confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . For hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining , selected slides were stained in hematoxylin ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 7231 ) for 3min and counterstained with eosin ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 7111 ) for 1 min . TRAP staining ( Sigma - Aldrich , 387A ) was performed in selected slides from each sample according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . In brief , selected slides were pre - warmed to 37°C in waterbath and incubated in TRAP Staining Solution Mix 37 °C at for 15 min . The nucleus was counterstained by Methyl green ( Millipore Sigma , M8884 ) . Images were captured using a polarized light microscope ( Nikon Eclipse VL100POL , Tokyo , Japan ) , and quantitative histomorphometric analysis was performed using Image J software ( v . 1 . 5 , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Cell sorting . All cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria TM SORP Cell Sorter ( BD Biosciences , USA ) . At week 1 after the placement of divalent cation - releasing alginate , the femurs were harvested and rinsed with 1X PBS ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 10010023 ) . After the removal of muscle tissue , bone marrow was ﬂ ushed out with 1X PBS . The cells on the cortical bone were isolated by digesting the crushed bone chips in PBS containing 1mg / mL Collagenase I ( Sigma - Aldrich , SCR103 ) for 20min at 37°C . Cells were thoroughly washed , underwent red blood cell lysis ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 00 - 4333 - 57 ) , and resuspended in PBS containing 2 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 26140079 ) . For cell sorting , YFP positive cells were sorted into chilled 15 mL centrifuge tubes containing PBS supplemented with 2 % FBS . The harvested cells were washed and centrifuged before the addition of RNeasy lysis buffer ( Qiagen , Germantown , MD , USA , 79216 ) for the extraction of total RNA . Cell culture . Primary BMM and DRG neurons from 4 - week - old mice were iso - lated . For the isolation of BMM , the mice were euthanized and both femurs were dissected to remove soft tissue . The femurs were then crushed into pieces and digested with α - MEM ( Minimum Essential Medium Eagle α Modi ﬁ cation , Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , MT10022CV ) containing 3mg / mL Collagenase I ( Worthington Bio - chemical Corp , Lakewood , NJ , USA , LS004194 ) , 4mg / mL dispase ( Sigma - Aldrich , D4818 ) , and 1 U / mL deoxyribonuclease - I ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 18047019 ) . The single - cell suspension was achieved by passing the solution through a cell strainer to remove tissue fragments . After incubation in a humidi ﬁ ed incubator with 5 % CO 2 at 37°C , the non - adherent cells were harvested and cul - tured in α - MEM supplemented with 20 ng / mL macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF , R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA , 416 - ML ) for 7 days . For the isolation of DRG neurons , DRGs from the L2 – L5 spinal levels were isolated in cold DMEM / F12 ( Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium / Nutrient Mixture F - 12 ) medium ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 11320033 ) and then digested with 1 mg / mL collagenase type A ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland , 05349907103 ) at 37 °C . After tri - turation and centrifugation , cells were resuspended and seeded on glass coverslips coated with ploy - D - lysine and laminin . The culture medium was replaced 6h after seeding , and the adherent cells were further cultured at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 for 3 days before use . ELISA . Whole blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture immediately after the mice were euthanized . Serum was collected by centrifuging at 2000 × g for 15 min and then stored at − 80°C before analysis . The total bone protein was harvested from the femurs grafted with pure alginate or Mg – Alg . The mid - shaft of the femur , approximately 1cm long , was ground into mud using a ceramic mortar and pestle under cooling . The mud of the bone tissue was then homogenized in pre - cooled radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) lysis and extraction buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 89900 ) for 1h . The buffer solution was centrifuged at 15 , 000 × g for 20 min at 4°C . The supernatant was collected for protein con - centration quanti ﬁ cation with the BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scien - ti ﬁ c , A53225 ) . An equal amount of protein from each sample was subjected to ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28203 - 0 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 13 : 535 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28203 - 0 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications quantitative analysis using a speci ﬁ c ELISA kit per the manufacturer ’ s instruction . The PGE 2 concentrations in the serum and bone marrow were determined by the PGE 2 ELISA kit ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI , USA , 514010 ) . The OCN level was determined by an OCN ELISA kit ( Biomedical Technologies Inc , Tewksbury , MA , USA , BT470 ) . The serum and urine epinephrine levels were determined by an epinephrine ELISA kit ( ALPCO , Salem , NH , USA , 17 - EPIHU - E01 . 1 ) . Quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) . The total RNA of the cells was extracted and puri ﬁ ed using the RNeasy Plus kit ( Qiagen , Germantown , MD , USA , 74034 ) per the manufacturer ’ s instructions . For the reverse transcrip - tion , complementary DNA was synthesized using the SuperScript First - Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 18091050 ) . The primers used in the RT – qPCR assay were synthesized by Life Technologies ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) based on sequences retrieved from Primer Bank ( http : / / pga . mgh . harvard . edu / primerbank , Supplementary Table 1 ) . SYBR Green - Master Mix ( Qiagen , Germantown , MD , USA , A46113 ) was used for the ampli ﬁ cation and detection of complementary DNA on a C1000 Thermal Cycler ( Bio - Rad Labora - tories , Hercules , CA ) . The mean cycle threshold ( Ct ) value of each target gene was normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) . The results were shown as a fold change using the ΔΔ Ct method . Western blot . The total protein from animal tissues or cell cultures was lysed using RIPA lysis and extraction buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 78430 ) . After centrifugation at 15 , 000 × g for 10min at 4°C , the supernatants were collected to measure the protein con - centration with the BCA Protein Assay Kit . A total of 30 µg of protein was sub - jected to sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then blotted on the nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , 1620115 ) . The membrane was blocked in 5 % w / v bovine serum albumin ( BSA , Sigma - Aldrich , A9418 ) and incubated with blocking buffer - diluted primary antibodies overnight at 4°C . The primary antibodies used were CREB ( Abcam , 178322 , 1 : 1000 ) , p - CREB ( Abcam , ab32096 , 1 : 1000 ) , HTR2C ( ab197776 , 1 : 1000 ) , COX2 ( Abcam , ab15191 , 1 : 1000 ) , p - I κ B α ( CST , 2859 , 1 : 1000 ) , I κ B α ( CST , 4814 , 1 : 1000 ) , p - NF - κ B p65 ( CST , 3033 , 1 : 1000 ) , NF - κ B p65 ( CST , 8242 , 1 : 1000 ) , and β - actin ( CST , 8457 , 1 : 2000 ) . The proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 34580 ) and exposed under a ChemiDoc XRS System ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Behavioral analysis . The spontaneous activity of mice after surgery was assessed using spontaneous activity wheels ( BIO - ACTIVW - M , Bioseb , Boulogne , France ) . Mice were housed in polycarbonate cages with free access to stainless steel activity wheels ( diameter 23cm ; width 5cm ) , which were connected to an analyzer that automatically recorded the distance traveled , mean speed , maximum speed , and total active time . The mice had ad libitum access to food and water during the test . They were allowed to acclimatize to the environment for at least 24h before data were recorded . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay . After the stimulation , the ChIP assay was performed using an Agarose ChIP Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 26156 ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . In brief , the chromatin was cross - linked by 1 % formaldehyde and digested by micrococcal nuclease . The lysate was incubated with rabbit anti - NF - κ B p65 at 4°C overnight followed by incubation with ChIP Grade Protein A / G Plus Agarose . The puri ﬁ ed DNA was analyzed by PCR assay using primers targeting mouse COX2 promoters : sense 5 ′ - CCCGGAG GGTAGTTCCATGAAAGACTTCAAC - 3 ′ and antisense 5 ′ - GGTGGAGCTGGC AGGATGCAGTCCTG - 3 ′ .
