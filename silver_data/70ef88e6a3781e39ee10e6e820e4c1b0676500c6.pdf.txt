After budding , clathrin must be uncoat - ed before the vesicles can fuse with other membranous structures . In vitro , the molecular chaperone Hsc70 uncoats clathrin - coated vesicles in an ATP - dependent process that requires a specific J - domain protein such as auxilin . However , there is little evidence that either Hsc70 or auxilin is essential in vivo . Here we show that C . elegans has a single auxilin homologue that is identical to mam - malian auxilin in its in vitro activity . When RNA - mediated interference ( RNAi ) is used to inhibit auxilin expression in C . elegans , oocytes show markedly reduced receptor - mediated endocytosis of yolk protein tagged with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) . In addition , most of these worms arrest during larval development , exhibit defective distri - bution of GFP – clathrin in many cell types , and show a marked change in clathrin dynamics , as determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . We conclude that auxilin is required for in vivo clathrin - mediated endocytosis and development in C . elegans . T wo mammalian J - domain proteins 1 that support uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles by Hsc70 in vitro have been discovered — auxilin 2 , 3 , which is nerve - specific , and cyclin - G - associated kinase ( GAK ) , which is ubiquitous 4 , 5 . In addition to a carboxy - ter - minal J - domain preceded by a clathrin - binding domain and a tensin domain 6 , GAK also contains an amino - terminal kinase domain 7 . A search of the complete C . elegans genome revealed a single predict - ed protein of relative molecular mass 107 , 000 ( M r 107K ; W07A8 . 3 ) as an auxilin homologue . C . elegans auxilin shares ~ 18 % amino - acid identity with mammalian auxilin , and the M r 25K C - terminal por - tion of the molecule , which includes the J - domain , shares ~ 32 % amino - acid identity with mammalian auxilin . For in vitro studies , we used a truncated fragment of C . elegans auxilin ( CeAUX - 53 ) that contains the M r 53K C - terminal domain , including the putative clathrin - binding domain and the J - domain , as we had previously established that the equivalent fragment of mammalian auxilin retains full uncoating activity 4 . We first tested whether CeAUX - 53 polymerizes clathrin . We found that , like mam - malian auxilin 4 , CeAUX - 53 polymerizes clathrin at a roughly 1 : 1 molar ratio of CeAUX - 53 to clathrin ( Fig . 1a ) . The structure of clathrin baskets polymerized by CeAUX - 53 appears to be normal , as shown by electron microscopy ( Fig . 1b ) . We next tested whether CeAUX - 53 carries out the other princi - pal functions of mammalian auxilin in vitro , and in particular whether it acts catalytically to support uncoating of clathrin baskets by Hsc70 at pH 7 and binding of Hsc70 to clathrin baskets at pH 6 . To test uncoating , we prepared auxilin - free clathrin baskets with double - purified clathrin and an M r 58K C - terminal recombinant fragment of the brain - specific assembly protein AP - 180 . At pH 7 in the presence of ATP , CeAUX - 53 supported uncoating by Hsc70 cat - alytically rather than stoichiometrically ( Fig . 1c ) . Similarly , at pH 6 in the presence of ATP , CeAUX - 53 acted catalytically to induce binding of Hsc70 to pure clathrin baskets ( Fig . 1d ) . The latter data indicate that , like mammalian auxilin and GAK , C . elegans auxilin may support uncoating by inducing Hsc70 to bind to clathrin bas - kets . Furthermore , C . elegans auxilin acts quantitatively as well as qualitatively like mammalian auxilin and GAK in its interaction with Hsc70 and clathrin baskets in the presence of ATP 2 – 5 . We next investigated whether C . elegans auxilin is required for receptor - mediated endocytosis in vivo . We monitored endocytosis by following the uptake into growing oocytes of the C . elegans yolk protein YP170 with a C - terminal fusion to GFP ( YP170 – GFP ) 8 . YP170 is expressed at high levels in the hermaphrodite intestine and secreted into the body cavity of the worm . From there it is taken up by receptor - mediated endocytosis into the oocytes and stored in membrane - bound vesicles . Yolk uptake by C . elegans oocytes is mechanistically similar to endocytosis of low - density lipoprotein in mammalian systems 8 . Monitoring the uptake of YP170 – GFP by oocytes in C . elegans provides a new screen for C . elegans proteins that are required for receptor - mediated endocytosis . To inhibit expression of auxilin , we used RNAi with C . elegans auxilin double - stranded RNA 9 , 10 . Comparison of wild - type and auxilin ( RNAi ) worms showed that in untreated animals YP170 – GFP was found in the intestine ( where it is synthesized ) , and in the almost full - grown oocytes and embryos , with very little present in the body cavity ( Fig . 2a , c ; see also ref . 8 ) . In contrast , in auxilin ( RNAi ) worms YP170 – GFP was found in the intestine and at very high levels in the body cavity , but very little accumulated in the oocytes or embryos ( Fig . 2b , d ) . Thus , uptake of YP170 – GFP by oocytes , but not secretion from the intestine , is severely reduced in auxilin ( RNAi ) animals . These results indicate that C . elegans aux - ilin is required for receptor - mediated endocytosis . Further evidence of this requirement comes from our observa - tion that most of the progeny of auxilin ( RNAi ) worms arrest devel - opment during the L1 and L2 larval stages ( Fig . 2e , f ) . After 3 – 4 days as L1 or L2 larvae , by which time wild - type controls have already reached adulthood , these animals develop vacuolated and constipated intestines and many have a double cuticle ( Fig . 2i , j ) , indicating a moulting defect . Most of these animals eventually die at varying larval stages ; a minority of the auxilin ( RNAi ) animals eventually become necrotic , scrawny adults , some of which are ster - ile . The most obvious defect in the intestine of auxilin ( RNAi ) lar - vae , before necrosis sets in , is the accumulation of highly refractive © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd brief communications NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 FEBRUARY 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 216 cytoplasmic granules ( Fig . 2h ) , which are not present in wild - type animals ( Fig . 2g ) . Thus , malfunction of the intestine may be the primary cause of death for auxilin ( RNAi ) animals . One possibility is that the transport of hydrolytic enzymes to the intestinal lyso - somes from the Golgi , which is a clathrin - mediated process , is defective in these intestinal cells , leading to an inability to break down nutrients after feeding . It is interesting , with regard to the double cuticle of auxilin ( RNAi ) larvae ( Fig . 2i , j ) , that mutation of LRP - 1 , the C . elegans megalin receptor , also arrests C . elegans dur - ing larval development by preventing moulting 11 . This raises the possibility that clathrin - mediated endocytosis may be required for proper functioning of the LRP - 1 receptor . Alternatively , interfer - ence with clathrin - mediated endocytosis might cause missorting of the Kex2 homologue , a furin - like endoprotease that is required for maturation of cuticle collagens 12 . However , as yet there is no evi - dence that defects in clathrin - based transport of vesicles from the Golgi to the endosome affects the localization of Golgi - resident endoproteases . We were unable to establish the function of auxilin in the C . elegans nervous system , because RNAi is generally ineffec - tive in C . elegans neurons 13 . We next determined how inhibition of auxilin expression in C . elegans affects the distribution of clathrin . We monitored clathrin distribution in wild - type and auxilin ( RNAi ) larvae using expres - sion of a transgene encoding a C . elegans clathrin heavy chain with an N - terminal fusion to GFP ( GFP – CHC ) . Although we were unable to monitor GFP – CHC fluorescence in oocytes because transgenes are not expressed in C . elegans germ cells 14 , we did find that wild - type L1 larvae showed weakly diffuse or somewhat punc - tate GFP – CHC fluorescence in many cell types , including coelo - mocytes ( Fig . 3a ) , pharyngeal cells ( Fig . 3c ) and hypodermal cells ( Fig . 3e ) . In contrast , auxilin ( RNAi ) L1 larvae exhibited much brighter , more punctate GFP – CHC fluorescence in all somatic cell types examined ( Fig . 3b , d , f ) . The increase in the number of punc - ta in the posterior lobe of the pharynx ( compare Fig . 3e and f ) , as well as higher magnification of the puncta in the hypodermis , make this particularly clear ( compare Fig . 3g and h ) . Although the diffuse GFP – CHC staining made it somewhat difficult to quantify the number of puncta in wild - type worms , examination of several samples of the posterior lobe of the phar - ynx showed a greater than twofold increase in the number of puncta in auxilin ( RNAi ) L1 larvae compared to the wild type ( 95 – 35 compared with 36 – 15 ) . This effect could be due to an accu - mulation of clathrin - coated vesicles or to a compensatory increase in clathrin expression , although we do not yet have a functional anti - clathrin antibody that could prove the latter possibility . In this regard , whereas only ~ 40 % of auxilin ( RNAi ) worms survived beyond early larval stages , most of auxilin ( RNAi ) worms that also expressed GFP – CHC survived to adulthood . As it is very likely that worms expressing GFP – CHC possess more clathrin than wild - type worms , it is possible that this increase in clathrin would par - tially overcome the defect in endocytosis caused by the inability to recycle clathrin . It should be noted that the absence of auxilin specifically affected both GFP – CHC distribution and clathrin - mediated endocytosis . In contrast to GFP – CHC distribution , the absence of auxilin had no effect on the the distribution of two other GFP - fusion proteins , YNK - 1 – GFP , a diffuse cytosolic pro - tein 15 , and RME - 8 – GFP , a cytosolic protein that is peripherally associated with endosomes ( Y . Z . and D . H . , unpublished observa - tions ) . Furthermore , the absence of auxilin did not affect secre - tion , as shown by the fact that yolk protein – GFP is still secreted in auxilin ( RNAi ) worms , or fluid - phase endocytosis , as shown by the fact that , like wild - type worms , auxilin ( RNAi ) worms take up sol - uble GFP from the body cavity and concentrate it in the lysosomes of coelomocytes ( data not shown ) . Reasoning that the failure of clathrin uncoating in auxilin ( RNAi ) L1 larvae might affect clathrin dynamics as well as clathrin distribution , we compared clathrin exchange in the coelo - mocytes of wild - type and auxilin ( RNAi ) L1 larvae using FRAP . After photobleaching of a portion of the GFP – CHC in wild - type coelomocytes , there was marked recovery of fluorescence over a 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 0 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 16 0 . 12 0 . 08 0 . 04 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 C l a t h r i n po l y m e r i z ed ( % ) F r ee c l a t h r i n ( m M ) CeAUX - 53 ( m M ) CeAUX - 53 ( m M ) H sc 70 bound ( % ) CeAUX - 53 ( m M ) a b c d Figure 1 CeAUX - 53 polymerizes clathrin and supports Hsc70 – clathrin inter - action . a , Clathrin ( 0 . 5 m M ) was polymerized in the presence of varying concen - trations of CeAUX - 53 , and the amount of clathrin polymerized was determined by centrifugation . b , Structure of clathrin baskets polymerized by CeAUX - 53 , as determined by electron microscopy .

In contrast , clathrin exchange may not occur in C . elegans auxilin ( RNAi ) coelomocytes because clathrin may be trapped either in clathrin - coated vesicles near the plasma membrane or in clathrin - coated pits . The latter effect might occur if Hsc70 and auxilin are involved in exchange of clathrin as planar clathrin - coated pits invaginate to form clathrin - coated vesicles , an idea that is supported by recent in vitro data indicating that Hsc70 is involved in returning clathrin to the membrane to form new clathrin - coated pits 17 . We conclude that auxilin is essential in vivo for endocytosis , probably through its function in uncoating clathrin from membranes . Future work will be required to relate this effect to the functions of other factors , such as membrane phosphoinositide levels 18 , that have also been implicated in the uncoating process . Methods Bioinformatics . Auxilin homologues in the C . elegans genome were identified using the National Center for Biotechnology Information interfaced to BLASTp BLOSUM62 . The C . elegans hypothetical protein W07A8 . 3 was compared to bovine auxilin protein S68983 by BLAST 2 PAM250 . Preparation of proteins . Hsc70 and clathrin were prepared as described 19 , 20 . The M r 58K C - terminal fragment of AP180 was prepared as a 6 · histidine ( 6His ) fusion protein from recombinant AP180 ( ref . 21 ) . Pure clathrin bas - kets and clathrin baskets made with assembly proteins were produced as described 4 , 22 . Part of a C . ele - gans complementary DNA encoding a truncated fragment of C . elegans auxilin was subcloned into pQE30 and expressed as a 6His fusion protein . The equivalent fragment of mammalian auxilin is much more easily expressed in Escerichia coli than the parent molecule and retains full uncoating activity 4 , 23 . The recombinant protein was expressed and purified as described 4 . General methods and strains . Worms were handled and cultured essentially as described 24 . All strains were grown at 20 o C unless otherwise stated . The wild - type parent for all strains was C . elegans var . Bristol strain N2 . cDNA sequencing , 5 ¢ RACE and RNAi . Two almost full - length cDNA clones , yk360c4 and yk390a4 , for the predicted C . elegans auxilin gene W07A8 . 3 were provided by Y . Kohara ( Natl Inst . Genetics , Japan ) . yk360c4 was sequenced using vector and internal sequencing primers . Two exon – intron boundries predicted by Genefinder were found to be incorrect , changing the predicted protein sequence ( see Genbank accession no . AF293972 ) . Both cDNAs contained poly ( A ) tails beginning 321 bp after the stop codon . The 5 ¢ end of the auxilin mes - sage was determined by 5 ¢ RACE ( Gibco - BRL ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . A single 5 ¢ RACE product was amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , and the product was sequenced directly . We found an SL1 trans - spliced leader starting 21 bp upstream of the predicted AUG codon , indicating the start of the mature messenger RNA . C . elegans auxilin cDNAs were used to produce dsRNA for microinjection into the pseudocoelom or intestine of L4 hermaphrodites , as described 9 , 10 . Groups of bIs1 [ vit - 2 : : GFP , rol - 6 ( d ) ] ( ref . 8 ) L4 her - maphrodites were microinjected with C . elegans auxilin dsRNA and allowed to recover for 48h before direct observation of oocytes and embryos within the P 0 by fluorescence microscopy . L4 stage N2 or bIs5 [ GFP : : CHC ] hermaphrodites were microinjected with C . elegans auxilin dsRNA , allowed to recover for 24h , and their F1 progeny were collected in single - day cohorts for analysis . Animals were immobi - lized for fluorescence microscopy using 0 . 1mgml – 1 levamisole . FRAP analyses . GFP was photobleached using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a · 100 1 . 4 NA objective . A defined region was photobleached at full laser power and recovery of fluorescence was monitored by scanning the whole cell at low laser power . Transgenic strains . Transgenic C . elegans strains were constructed to express a full - length C . elegans GFP – CHC fusion pro - tein under the control of the C . elegans clathrin heavy chain ( T20G5 . 1 ; ref . 8 ) promotor . The resulting plasmid , pGFP – CHC , was linearized and injected at 1 . 25ngml – 1 , together with linearized rol - 6 ( d ) marker plasmid pRF4 at 1 . 25ngml – 1 , and Pvu II - digested N2 genomic DNA at 90ngml – 1 , to create extrachromasomal transgenic lines . One of these lines was integrated into a chromosome by g - irrada - tion using standard methods 25 , 26 . All extrachromosomal and integrated lines expressed diffuse cytoplas - mic and punctate GFP – CHC in many somatic tissues , but not in germ cells . One integrated line , bIs5 [ GFP : : CHC , rol - 6 ( d ) ] was chosen for this study . RECEIVED 25 AUGUST 2000 ; REVISED 10 NOVEMBER 2000 ; ACCEPTED 10 NOVEMBER 2000 ; PUBLISHED 18 JANUARY 2000 . 1 .
