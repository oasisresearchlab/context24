To ensure accurate chromosome segregation , it performs three major functions using disparate molecular mechanisms . It operates a mechanosensitive signaling cascade known as the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) to detect and signal the lack of attachment to spindle microtubules , and delay anaphase onset in response . In addition , after attaching to spindle microtubules , the kinetochore generates the force necessary to move chromosomes . Finally , if the two sister kinetochores on a chromosome are both attached to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole , they activate another mechanosensitive mechanism to correct the monopolar attachments . All three of these functions maintain genome stability during cell division . The outlines of the biochemical activities responsible for these functions are now available . How the kinetochore integrates the underlying molecular mechanisms is still being elucidated . In this Review , we discuss how the nanoscale protein organization in the kinetochore , which we refer to as kinetochore ‘architecture’ , organizes its biochemical activities to facilitate the realization and integration of emergent mechanisms underlying its three major functions . For this discussion , we will use the relatively simple budding yeast kinetochore as a model , and extrapolate insights gained from this model to elucidate func - tional roles of the architecture of the much more complex human kinetochore . Introduction Multi - protein assemblies and machines assume tremendously diverse composition and organization to perform complex cell biological functions . An excellent example of a protein assembly is the endocytic coat , which is a transient , continuously evolving assemblage of many interacting proteins [ 1 ] . At the other extreme is the nuclear pore . The core scaffold of the nuclear pore is a long - lived structure containing precisely organized copies of many proteins [ 2 ] . In both cases , the protein ‘architecture’ , deﬁned as the nanoscale spatial organization of component proteins within the protein assembly or machine , inﬂuences how they cooperate with one another to realize their functions . Reductionist methods have been extremely success - ful in deﬁning structure – function relationships for individual proteins . However , to fully understand multi - protein machines , integrative approaches that deﬁne how individual components give rise to emergent functions , and establish ‘architecture – function’ relationships , are also necessary . The eukaryotic kinet - ochore presents an excellent case to study architecture – function relationships . Much is now known about the structures , biochemical activ - ities , and the biophysics of the component proteins of the kinet - ochore that execute its three major functions ( Figure 1A ) [ 3 ] . However , this knowledge does not fully reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms , explain how the kinetochore integrates these mechanisms into one framework , or predict the possibility of cross - talk among its functions [ 4 ] . For this , the spatial orga - nization of the biochemical activities must be considered . Complicating this analysis , however , is the fact that most eukary - otic kinetochores bind multiple microtubules dynamically . For example , the human kinetochore simultaneously interacts with the plus - ends of (cid:1) 20 microtubules that exist as a mixed popula - tion of both polymerizing and depolymerizing microtubules . Furthermore , the (cid:1) 200 nm diameter disk - shaped human kineto - chore is densely populated with a large and diverse set of pro - teins , most of which are resent in multiple copies . In this context , the kinetochore found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a particularly suitable model , because it stably binds to the plus - end of one microtubule in metaphase [ 5 , 6 ] . It thus represents the basic functional unit of the eukaryotic kinet - ochore — one kinetochore – microtubule attachment . Important aspects of the architecture of the yeast kinetochore – microtubule attachment in metaphase have been quantiﬁed . Models of kinetochore architecture created from these and structural data provide the starting point needed to study architecture – function relationships [ 7 , 8 ] . The core protein machinery of the yeast kinetochore is conserved . Therefore , the architecture – function relationships derived from budding yeast will provide insight into the operation of the highly complex human kinetochore . Indeed , a recent study proposedanelegantconceptualizationofthehumankinetochore as the two - dimensional convolution of multiple yeast kineto - chore - like subunits over a disk - shaped surface [ 9 ] . Nevertheless , the human kinetochore is built for entirely different performance speciﬁcations — it must coordinate the activities of its multiple microtubule binding sites to move the chromosome over longer distances ( (cid:1) 5 m m versus < 0 . 5 m m in budding yeast ) [ 10 ] , against much larger opposing forces ( > 100 pN versus < 7 pN in yeast ) [ 11 , 12 ] . In this Review , we will use the budding yeast kinetochore as a starting point for the discussion of architecture – function R816 Current Biology 27 , R816 – R824 , August 21 , 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Ltd . relationships . We will then highlight how these relationships may ﬁt into the complex architecture of the human kinetochore , and the areas in which the two kinetochores likely diverge . The Composition , Assembly Pathways , and Biochemical Activities of the Kinetochore We begin the discussion by brieﬂy describing the essential biochemical activities that execute the three major functions of the kinetochore ( please see the recent review by Musacchio and Desai [ 3 ] for a comprehensive discussion of the molecular biology of the kinetochore ) . We will refer to each protein by the name for the human ortholog followed by a super - scripted name of the corresponding budding yeast protein , if it is different . From the functional perspective , the protein composition and assembly of the kinetochore can be simpliﬁed as follows ( Figure 1B ) . The kinetochoreinteractswiththemicrotubuleandwithSACsignaling proteins through a network of three protein complexes : KNL1 Spc105 , Mis12 Mtw1 , and Ndc80 , collectively referred to as the KMN network [ 13 – 15 ] . This interface is assembled by two parallel pathways initiated by the proteins CENP - C Mif2 and CENP - T Cnn1 [ 16 – 20 ] . CENP - C Mif2 andCENP - T Cnn1 areassembled on a well - deﬁned territory on each chromosome , known as the centromere , through their interactions with the centromere - speciﬁc histone H3 variant CENP - A Cse4 [ 9 , 19 , 21 ] . Although the CENP - C Mif2 and CENP - T Cnn1 pathways are conserved , Ndc80 Ndc80 Ndc80 Mis12 Mtw1 Mis12 Mtw1 KNL1 Spc105 KNL1 Spc105 CENP - T Cnn1 CENP - C Mif2 CENP - A Nucleosome Centromere - associatedproteins Mps1 Dam1 ring XMAP215 Stu2 Protein copy number Protein localization Protein distribution Current Biology Protein stoichiometry Ndc80 Mis12 Mtw1 KNL1 Spc105 Aurora B Ipl1 Binding site 1 3 2 B A C Figure 1 .

( C ) Reconstruction of the protein architecture of the budding yeast kinetochore using ﬂuorescence microscopy measurements and protein structures [ 7 , 8 , 14 , 15 , 32 , 33 , 48 – 50 , 73 ] . Centromere - associated proteins are represented by white , oblong shapes . their contribution to kinetochore func - tion is species - speciﬁc — both pathways are required for the function of the human kinetochore , whereas only the CENP - C Mif2 pathway is required in budding yeast [ 22 ] . Remarkably , the three kinetochore mechanisms of end - on microtubule attachment , SAC signaling , and error correction ultimately focus on just two proteins that directly interface the kine - tochore with the microtubule and the SAC signaling machinery — Ndc80 and KNL1 Spc105 . To activate the SAC , the calponin - homology ( CH ) domains of Ndc80 , which are globular domains located at the microtu - bule - binding end of the complex , bind the SAC activator , Mps1 kinase [ 8 , 23 – 25 ] . Mps1 phosphorylates conserved motifs within KNL1 Spc105 to enable these motifs to recruit a number of SAC signaling proteins , and form the mitotic checkpoint com - plex [ 26 – 30 ] . KNL1 Spc105 also recruits phosphatases that antag - onize Mps1 to facilitate SAC silencing [ 26 ] . In addition to the crucial role of recruiting Mps1 for SAC signaling , the CH - do - mains of Ndc80 also function as the primary binding site that establishes end - on microtubule attachment [ 31 , 32 ] . To main - tain end - on attachments and to generate force , Ndc80 recruits several accessory microtubule - associated proteins ( e . g . , Dam1 complex in fungi , Ska complex , Astrin / SKAP , etc . in metazoa [ 33 – 35 ] ) . Finally , the kinetochore destabilizes monopolar at - tachments by directing the Aurora B Ipl1 kinase toward the microtubule - binding domains of Ndc80 and other proteins , thereby weakening their afﬁnity for the microtubule [ 36 – 42 ] . This description of the biochemical activities of kinetochore proteins does not fully explain the underlying molecular mech - anisms — knowledge of kinetochore architecture is required to elucidate how these activities cooperate . Furthermore , the functional roles of any reorganization of the kinetochore induced by microtubule attachment or dynamic changes within the architecture during kinetochore movement must also be studied . Current Biology 27 , R816 – R824 , August 21 , 2017 R817 Current Biology Review The Protein Architecture in the End - On Kinetochore – Microtubule Attachment The end - on morphology of the kinetochore – microtubule attach - ment is highly conserved in all eukaryotes that have been studied to date [ 6 ] . Kinetochore researchers recognized early on that this morphology plays an integral role in its functional mechanisms , and proposed generalized models centered on the end - on morphology to explain the functional mechanisms [ 43 – 45 ] . To test the implementation of these model mechanisms , however , it is necessary to ﬁrst deﬁne the biochemical properties and structures of kinetochore components , and then their organiza - tion within the end - on kinetochore – microtubule attachment . The latter part has proven to be a signiﬁcant challenge . The kinetochore is a network of several protein components , most of which are present in multiple copies . Many of these compo - nents contain inherently ﬂexible domains and linkages [ 3 ] . Addi - tionally , the microtubule plus - end likely re - organizes this protein network in a functionally signiﬁcant manner [ 46 , 47 ] . These issues pose a major obstacle for structural biological approaches in deﬁning its architecture . Resolving the positions of individual molecules in the densely packed kinetochore is also beyond the capabilities of super - resolution microscopy . Therefore , alter - native approaches are necessary to determine the architecture . One such approach is to re - construct kinetochore architecture by answering simpler questions pertaining to its key features ( Figure 1C ) . How many molecules of each protein component does one kinetochore incorporate , and how variable is this num - ber ? What is the average position of each component , and are these positions variable ? What is the axial and circumferential distribution of protein molecules about their average positions ? Quantitative answers to these questions obtained from diverse ﬂuorescence microscopy methods and combined with the known structures of kinetochore proteins established a detailed model of the architecture of the KMN network in the budding yeast kinetochore – microtubule attachment [ 7 , 48 – 50 ] . Although this architecture invokes certain assumptions , speciﬁcally the circular symmetry of kinetochore proteins around the microtu - bule diameter and the relative positions of the CH - domains and the Dam1 ring , it has enabled powerful predictions regarding the emergent mechanisms of kinetochore function ( discussed in the sections below ) . Much work is still needed to synthesize a similar understand - ing of the architecture of the human kinetochore . The average copy numbers of KMN network molecules per kinetochore , and their organization along the axis of the microtubule in metaphase are known [ 51 , 52 ] . However , their distribution about the average positions and over the disk - shaped surface of the centromere is unknown , a problem that is signiﬁcantly complicated by the fact that human kinetochores contain mul - tiple microtubule binding sites ( Figure 2A ) . Identiﬁcation of the CENP - A Cse4 nucleosome as the minimal foundation for assem - bling the KMN network will simplify this problem to some extent [ 9 , 18 ] . This ﬁnding is useful for proposing a model for the ‘local’ kinetochore architecture , deﬁned as the organization of kinetochore proteins in one kinetochore – microtubule attach - ment . The bilateral symmetry the CENP - A Cse4 nucleosome will impose an orientation and spacing on the two CENP - C Mif2 molecules that it recruits ( Figure 2B , top ) . This patterning of CENP - C Mif2 will then direct the spatial organization of other centromeric proteins , including CENP - T Cnn1 . Thus , the spatial organization of centromeric proteins will ultimately dictate the patterning of KMN network molecules , and hence the architecture of the interface of the human kinetochore with the microtubule plus - end ( Figure 2B , bottom ) . Beyond the local architecture of KMN molecules within one attachment lies the broader architecture of the kinetochore — the distribution of many such attachments across the disk - shaped surface of the centromere . This broader architecture will inﬂuence the ability of the kinetochore to interact simultaneously with many microtubule plus - ends . Deﬁning both the local and broader architecture of the human kinetochore remains a major challenge for the ﬁeld .

R818 Current Biology 27 , R816 – R824 , August 21 , 2017 Current Biology Review Kinetochore Architecture Encodes a Mechanism for Sensing End - On Attachment In most eukaryotes , the kinetochore is unattached at the begin - ning of mitosis . To avoid chromosome missegregation , it delays cell division by activating the SAC . Typically , the kinetochore ﬁrst binds laterally to the microtubule lattice , and then converts this interaction into a stable end - on attachment . SAC inactivation oc - curs once end - on attachments form [ 23 , 53 ] . Recent work reveals two mechanisms that the kinetochore can use to detect end - on attachment and silence the SAC in response [ 8 , 23 , 24 ] . Both mechanisms rely on the dual role of the CH - domains of Ndc80 as the Mps1 binding site and as the interface for end - on attach - ment . The ﬁrst mechanism , studied in human cells , proposes that Mps1 and the microtubule plus - end compete for binding to the CH - domains of Ndc80 [ 23 , 24 ] . Consequently , end - on at - tachments displace Mps1 from the kinetochore so that it can no longer phosphorylate KNL1 Spc105 . The second mechanism , which comes from studies in budding yeast , suggests an integral role for kinetochore architecture in implementing the attach - ment - mediated SAC silencing [ 8 ] . The signaling state of the yeast kinetochore is determined by a single change in its architecture that is elicited by end - on attach - ment . In the unattached , SAC active kinetochore , the CH - do - mains of Ndc80 are located within 10 nm of the phosphodomain of KNL1 Spc105 ( Figure 3A , top ) . Therefore , Mps1 bound to the CH - domains robustly phosphorylates KNL1 Spc105 and the SAC proteins that it recruits , initiating the SAC . In the attached , SAC inactive kinetochore , the CH - domains and KNL1 Spc105 phospho - domain are (cid:1) 30 nm apart [ 50 ] . This prevents Mps1 from phos - phorylating KNL1 Spc105 , thereby disrupting SAC signaling ( Figure 3A , bottom ) . If the 30 nm gap is experimentally abridged , the yeast kinetochore becomes unable to sense end - on attach - ment , and the SAC becomes constitutively active [ 8 ] . Thus , the yeast kinetochore relies on the separation between Mps1 and its target to detect end - on attachments . Despite recent progress , two signiﬁcant questions about the mechanism of SAC silencing remain unresolved . The ﬁrst ques - tion is whether the silencing mechanism exclusively relies on the presence of end - on attachment , or whether it also requires force generation by such an attachment . Recent observations suggest that force generation is not necessary for SAC silencing [ 54 , 55 ] . This conclusion is consistent with the biochemical competition mechanism for SAC silencing , which does not require any force . It is also consistent with the architecture - based model of SAC silencing : the displacement of two protein domains is unlikely to require a large force [ 8 , 56 ] . Future biophysical analyses of SAC silencing by the kinetochore will unequivocally establish whether SAC silencing requires signiﬁcant force generation by end - on attachment . The second question relates to the assump - tion of the binary , switch - like activation and inactivation of the SAC in the two models . This description is superﬁcially valid for the yeast kinetochore , which can exist in only one of two states — attached or unattached . The binary state description does not apply to the human kinetochore , because it attaches CH - domain Microtubuleplus - end 30 nm Loss of XMAP215 Stu2 Centromerictension Tension - dependent detachment GTP cap Dam1 XMAP215 Stu2 ?

Bottom panel : In the absence of XMAP215 activity , centromeric tension can slide the kinetochore off the growing plus - end . ( C ) Potential roles for kinetochore architecture in correcting monopolar attachment . The position of the plus - end may be signiﬁcantly different in kinetochores with bipolar and monopolar attachment ( highlighted by the arrow , top and bottom panels , respectively ) . The proximity of the lattice to the centromere may facilitate the transport of hyper - activated Aurora B Ipl1 kinase to its targets — microtubule - binding kinetochore proteins . Current Biology 27 , R816 – R824 , August 21 , 2017 R819 Current Biology Review dynamically to (cid:1) 20 microtubule plus - ends that turn over completely in about 4 minutes [ 57 ] . Furthermore , study of meta - phase kinetochores in Potaroo kidney ( PtK1 ) cells suggest that the kinetochore possesses (cid:1) 15 % excess microtubule - binding capacity that is unused even in metaphase [ 58 ] . To distinguish between partial attachment from a complete lack of attach - ments , the human kinetochore may use either additional regula - tion or more complex mechanisms to silence the SAC . For example , to inactivate the SAC , the human kinetochore may use either a temporal threshold deﬁned by a minimum time period that the kinetochore must spend in the attached state , or a number threshold deﬁned by the minimum number of micro - tubules bound by the kinetochore . Very little is known about the existence or nature of such mechanisms . The Role of Kinetochore Architecture in Driving Persistent , Bidirectional Chromosome Movement As suggested by its name , the major function of the kinetochore is to drive chromosome movement . It produces the force neces - sary for generating movement by harnessing microtubule poly - merization dynamics . It is reasonable to expect that the architec - ture of the microtubule - binding kinetochore proteins is tailored to suit the changing form and position of tubulin dimers at the plus - end . The kinetochore also recruits motor proteins and microtubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) as accessory factors for attachment and force generation . These proteins are ex - pected to occupy positions dictated by their interactions with kinetochore proteins and the microtubule . The relatively simple and well - deﬁned microtubule - binding machinery of the yeast kinetochore and its persistent interaction with one microtubule plus - end in metaphase provide the ideal opportunity to study the signiﬁcance of its architecture to force generation . Ndc80 is the linchpin of end - on kinetochore – microtubule attachment ( Figure 3B ) . It uses three microtubule - binding do - mains : a positively - charged disordered amino - terminal tail of the Ndc80 subunit and the CH - domains of the Ndc80 and Nuf2 subunits [ 59 ] . The disordered tail binds to the negatively - charged tubulin tails . This binding assists in the initial contact between the kinetochore and the microtubule lattice [ 60 ] . The CH - domains bind in the groove between tubulin monomers along a straight tubulin protoﬁlament in the microtubule lattice , but they cannot do so if this groove is distorted , as in a curling , depolymerizing protoﬁlament [ 32 , 61 ] . This property of the CH - domains is essential for forming end - on kinetochore – microtu - bule attachments [ 13 , 62 ] . Ndc80 structure appears to be tailored for both lateral and end - on attachment — it contains a ﬂexible hinge in its front section to enable the CH - domains access to the binding groove between tubulin monomers by making a 40 (cid:3) angle to the microtubule axis [ 63 ] . The conformation of Ndc80 in metaphase yeast kinetochores suggests that they can assume the preferred orientation for the CH - domains to bind to the lattice ( Figure 3B , top ) [ 7 ] . Ndc80 positions the kinetochore at the plus - end , but it cannot hold on to a dynamic plus - end against high opposing forces [ 64 ] . In budding yeast , the Dam1 complex , which is recruited by Ndc80 , is essential for force generation [ 38 , 65 ] . Dam1 molecules likely assemble in the form of an oligomeric ring encir - cling the microtubule [ 7 , 33 , 66 ] . The Dam1 ring mechanically opposes the outward curling of tubulin protoﬁlaments during depolymerization , and thus experiences a poleward force [ 67 , 68 ] . However , to generate force in this manner , the Dam1 ring must be positioned at the edge of the microtubule lattice , where it can encounter curling protoﬁlaments [ 69 ] . Therefore , it is not surprising that Dam1 localizes in close proximity to the CH - domains of Ndc80 , which likely bind to the microtubule lat - tice near the plus - end ( Figure 3B , top ) [ 7 , 50 ] . It is reasonable to expect that the Dam1 ring is positioned on the centromeric side of the CH - domains so that it can transmit the force gener - ated to the centromere through Ndc80 [ 7 ] . The mechanical opposition to microtubule depolymerization offered by the Dam1 complex also institutes a crucial regulatory mechanism known as ‘tension - dependent rescue’ of the depolymerizing plus - end [ 11 , 38 , 70 ] . As the opposing pull of sister kinetochores on the centromere increases , the Dam1 ring inhibits the confor - mational change that the tubulin dimers undergo to depoly - merize . This force - dependent inhibition promotes the transition from microtubule depolymerization to polymerization . Conse - quently , the kinetochore switches its direction of movement , and relieves centromeric tension in the process . Tension - depen - dent rescue is necessary for persistent attachment of sister kinetochores to spindle microtubules . The high combined afﬁnity of the Ndc80 - Dam1 ring assembly likely makes its diffusion along the microtubule lattice very slow [ 67 ] . If diffusion is much slower than the rate of microtubule poly - merization , then biased - diffusion may not be able keep pace with the polymerizing microtubule tip . The higher afﬁnity of the Dam1 complex for GTP - tubulin , which is present only at the growing microtubule tip , over GDP - tubulin present in the lattice enables Dam1 monomers and small oligomers to track growing microtubule tips [ 38 , 71 ] . However , whether Dam1 rings can also do this is unclear . Indeed , yeast kinetochore particles have not been observed to track polymerizing microtubule plus - ends in vitro , unless they are experimentally assisted by the imposition of an external force directed toward the plus - end [ 11 ] . Centro - meric strain will drag the kinetochore toward the plus - end in vivo , but this process depends on the magnitude of the strain , and it is independent of the growth of the plus - end ( Figure 3B , middle ) . This means that the movement induced by high centromeric ten - sion could potentially slide the kinetochore off the polymerizing microtubule tip , and additional mechanisms may be necessary to mitigate this possibility . In this context , the involvement of XMAP215 Stu2 in yeast kinet - ochore motility is noteworthy , but also perplexing . Although XMAP215 Stu2 is a well - known tubulin polymerase , it destabilizes microtubules during mitosis in yeast cells [ 72 , 73 ] . Consistent with this ﬁnding , XMAP215 Stu2 localizes in a region within the yeast kinetochore where the polymerizing plus - end is expected to be located ( Figure 3B , middle ) [ 7 ] . On the other hand , in vitro ﬁndings suggest that XMAP215 Stu2 stabilizes attachment of yeast kinetochores to the microtubule tip in a tension - dependent manner [ 74 ] . We suggest a simple model to reconcile these ob - servations ( Figure 3B , middle & bottom panels ) . We propose that XMAP215 Stu2 recognizes polymerizing microtubule plus - ends within yeast kinetochores and promotes their transition to depo - lymerization . This prevents the plus - ends from outpacing the kinetochore , and minimizes the possibility of the kinetochore sliding off a growing microtubule tip under high centromeric tension . R820 Current Biology 27 , R816 – R824 , August 21 , 2017 Current Biology Review The conserved mechanics and biochemistry underlying microtubule plus - end dynamics suggest that the basic mecha - nisms of harnessing force and persistent bidirectional movement used by the budding yeast kinetochore will be conserved in hu - man kinetochores . This is reﬂected in the similar organization of microtubule - binding activities in the yeast and human kineto - chore [ 50 , 52 ] . Ndc80 is similarly organized and required for end - on attachment in both kinetochores [ 50 , 52 , 75 ] . However , the human kinetochore attaches to (cid:1) 20 microtubule plus - ends on average , and these attachments are dynamic — they turn over with a half - life of (cid:1) 4 minutes ( in RPE - 1 cells [ 76 ] compared to (cid:1) 25 – 30 minutes duration of mitosis [ 10 ] ) . The human kineto - chore also employs a much larger array of accessory motors and MAPs to elaborate on the basic mechanisms of force gener - ation . The motors include MCAK , Kif18A , Dynein , and CENP - E [ 77 – 80 ] . The MAPs include the Ska complex , Astrin / SKAP , CLASP , EB1 , and XMAP215 Stu2 [ 34 , 35 , 81 – 84 ] . The mechanisms of kinetochore recruitment and organization of some of these accessory proteins are similar to the corresponding mechanisms in yeast [ 52 , 77 – 80 , 85 ] . For example , the recruitment and location of the Ska complex in the human kinetochore appears similar to that of Dam1 in the yeast kinetochore [ 85 ] . The collective activ - ities of these proteins in microtubule - binding and in modulating plus - end polymerization dynamics establish and maintain end - on kinetochore – microtubule attachment , generate force , and coordinate the activities of sister kinetochores to drive persis - tent , bidirectional chromosome movement . One puzzling aspect of the large array of accessory motors and MAPs employed by the human kinetochore is the apparent redundancy in their activities and kinetochore - speciﬁc functions . For example , Ska and XMAP215 are involved in microtubule attachment and force generation ; EB1 , CLASP , and Astrin / SKAP promote plus - end polymerization [ 34 , 74 , 84 , 86 , 87 ] . This redundancy may be necessary in part to achieve robust kineto - chore functionality . However , it is also possible that the unique kinetochore position of some of these proteins assigns them with unique functions . For example , MCAK and Kif18A can both destabilize the plus - end [ 77 , 88 ] . However , MCAK improves the coordinated movement of sister kinetochores , whereas Kif18A promotes the mutually antagonistic activity of the sisters and reduces their coordinated movements [ 77 , 78 ] . In addition to differences in the biochemical activities of these motors , how they encounter the microtubule plus - end in the kinetochore may give rise to the differences in their function . MCAK localizes at the centromere , whereas Kif18A walks along the microtubule to reach the plus - ends ( Figure 2A , B ) [ 89 ] . Due to its centromeric localization , MCAK may selectively destabilize only those plus - ends that polymerize to extend more than usual towards the centromere . In contrast , Kif18A - mediated plus - end destabiliza - tion may be dependent on microtubule length / age [ 78 , 90 ] . Thus , differences in function may arise from differences in protein position . Therefore , to fully understand how the human kinetochore brings about bidirectional chromosome movement , the biochemical activities as well as the nanoscale architecture of its microtubule - binding machinery must be studied . Addition - ally , any temporal coordination of these activities and dynamics of protein architecture are also likely to play key roles in kinetochore motility [ 91 ] . A major challenge in the ﬁeld is to formulate a comprehensive model that explains how the human kinetochore synthesizes the activities of its microtubule - binding proteins to control plus - end dynamics , and generate persistent , bidirectional chromosome movement . Potential Roles of Kinetochore Architecture in Correcting Monopolar Attachments Although bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores to microtu - bules emanating from opposite spindle poles is strongly favored , two types of erroneous attachments occur frequently — mero - telic and monopolar [ 57 , 92 , 93 ] . The ﬁrst type of erroneous at - tachments is known as merotelic attachment , wherein a single kinetochore attaches to microtubules emanating from both poles . There is no kinetochore - based mechanism for the resolu - tion of merotelic attachments ; these attachments are destabi - lized , and bipolar attachments stabilized , by a ﬁnely tuned regu - lation of the dynamicity of spindle microtubules [ 57 , 94 ] . The second type of erroneous attachments are known as syntelic or monopolar attachments , wherein both sister kinetochores in a pair are attached to the same pole . These attachments are de - stabilized by a dedicated , kinetochore - based error correction process . Two elements of this process are clear . First , it directs Aurora B Ipl1 kinase activity toward microtubule - binding kinetochore proteins to weaken their microtubule - binding afﬁnity [ 36 – 42 , 95 ] . Second , the activity of the error correction process is strongly correlated with a sustained lack of centromeric tension , which is a characteristic unique to sister kinetochores with monopolar attachments [ 36 ] . Interestingly , sister kinetochores with bipolar attachments also experience periodic and transient loss of centromeric tension , but they do not activate the error correction process . How the kinetochore senses a prolonged absence of centromeric tension , and activates Aurora B Ipl1 in response , is unclear . Potential mechanisms that can explain this error correction process have been discussed in excellent reviews ( e . g . , see [ 92 , 96 ] ) . Therefore , we will only describe the prevalent model , and focus on the potential role of kinetochore architecture in the error correction process . The prevalent model postulates that centromeric tension in the human kinetochore separates Aurora B Ipl1 from its phosphoryla - tion targets in a manner that is superﬁcially similar to the mecha - nismofattachment - dependentSACsignaling [ 36 , 97 ] . AuroraB Ipl1 dynamically localizes to chromatin situated in between the sister centromeres ( Figure 2A ) . Here , the high local concentration of Aurora B Ipl1 stimulates its auto - phosphorylation and hence hy - per - activation . Super - imposition of a phosphatase activity on this Aurora B Ipl1 hyperactivation region creates a steep gradient in Aurora B Ipl1 kinase activity ( Figure 3C ) [ 97 ] . Sister kinetochores withmonopolarattachmentfallwithintheregionofAuroraB Ipl1 hy - peractivity , whereaskinetochoreswithbipolarattachmentdeform the centromere and emerge out of it . Consequently , microtubule - binding proteins in these kinetochores become dephosphory - lated , and microtubule attachment is stabilized . Although this elegantmechanism isstronglysupportedby data fromvertebrate kinetochores , it does not explain a key observation from budding yeast . Budding yeast kinetochores correct monopolar attach - ments even when Aurora B Ipl1 is unable to localize to the centro - mere [ 98 ] . Therefore , additional mechanisms in the error correc - tion process remain to be discovered in both yeast and humans . Kinetochore architecture is clearly important in the prevalent model of the error - correction process , because it determines Current Biology 27 , R816 – R824 , August 21 , 2017 R821 Current Biology Review the positions of Aurora B Ipl1 targets relative to the centromere - localized Aurora B Ipl1 . However , the architecture of kinetochores with monopolar and bipolar attachments is likely to be similar given that they both possess end - on attachment . A key differ - ence in kinetochore architecture under the two scenarios may be that the plus - end is in close proximity to the centromere only in kinetochores with monopolar attachment ( Figure 3C ) . One possibility is that the error correction mechanism uses the proximity between centromere - localized Aurora B Ipl1 and the microtubule plus - end to locally concentrate , and then effectively transport active Aurora B Ipl1 along the microtubule to microtu - bule - bound kinetochore proteins [ 98 ] . However , the role of kinetochore architecture , if any , in mechanisms that direct Aurora B Ipl1 activity selectively to kinetochores with monopolar attachments remains poorly understood . Concluding Remarks The nanoscale architecture of the kinetochore provides insight into how it integrates three truly disparate mechanisms in one molecular framework . Comparison of the yeast and human ki - netochores also reveals how the basic integration of the three mechanisms may be enhanced to meet species - speciﬁc func - tional requirements . In the integrative model of the eukaryotic kinetochore , Ndc80 emerges as the focal point of all three mech - anisms . It acts as the terminal of a switch that controls the SAC , the conformational sensor that positions the kinetochore at the plus - end , an organizer of microtubule - binding activities in the kinetochore , and a major target of phosphoregulation by Aurora B Ipl1 . Therefore , the spatial patterning of Ndc80 in the kineto - chore and its architecture relative to the microtubule plus - end will play key roles in shaping the emergent mechanisms underly - ing all three kinetochore functions . Future studies of the kineto - chore that explicitly test the role of kinetochore architecture in its functional and regulatory mechanisms will lead us to a comprehensive understanding of one of the most fascinating multi - protein machines in cell biology .
