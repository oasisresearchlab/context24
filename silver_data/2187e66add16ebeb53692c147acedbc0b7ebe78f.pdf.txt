Kennedy , January 17 , 1983 ABSTRACT Mouse monoclonal antibodies have been made that are specific for one of the light chains ( LC - A ) of calf brain clathrin . The determinant they recognize has been mapped by im - munoelectron microscopy and shown to lie near the center of a clathrin trimer . Quantitative immunoprecipitation experiments with one of the monoclonal antibodies suggests that , despite the overall 1 : 2 stoichiometry , the light chain composition of an indi - vidual clathrin trimer is nearly random . Clathrin isolated from coated vesicles of bovine brain is a trimer of three heavy chains and three light chains ( 1 ) . The heavy chains have a molecular weight of 180 , 000 ; the light chains are of two species - LC - A , Mr 36 , 000 ; LC - B , Mr 33 , 000 - in a ratio ( mol / mol ) of 1 : 2 ( 1 - 3 ) . Each heavy chain has a single closely asso - ciated light chain ( 1 ) . Purified trimers can reassemble in vitro into coat - like structures referred to as cages ( 1 , 3 - 7 ) . Clathrin trimers have been visualized in the electron mi - croscope by rotary shadowing ( 3 ) and by negative staining ( 1 , 7 ) . Their unusual tribrachial shape ( see Fig . 4 ) makes immu - nolabeling and single - molecule electron microscopy useful for exploring the localization of different components . The spatial arrangement of ribosomal proteins has been determined with this technique by using affinity - purified polyclonal antibodies bound to specific surface sites ( 8 , 9 ) . The use of monoclonal antibodies as a structural probe has the advantage that they rec - ognize a unique antigenic region . The possibility for spurious crossreactions and nonspecific binding is thus greatly reduced . We have generated mouse monoclonal antibodies against pu - rified clathrin and mapped the location of one of the antigenic regions . We show here that three monoclonal antibodies spe - cifically recognizing light chain LC - A bind at a single site lo - cated at the proximal end of a clathrin arm . We have also used one of these monoclonal antibodies to ex - amine the distribution of light chains LC - A and LC - B in the population of trimers . The 1 : 2 ratio of these species would be consistent with a distribution of one LC - A and two LC - B on every trimer ( note that this could only be true if the 1 : 2 ratio were precise ) ; with a distribution into two classes of trimers in a 1 : 2 ratio ( mol / mol ) , each with three copies of a single species of light chain ; or with a more random distribution with trimers having all possible LC - A / LC - B ratios from 3 : 0 to 0 : 3 . Im - munoprecipitation of clathrin with a monoclonal antibody against LC - A gives results consistent only with the third possibility : that is , with a nearly random distribution of light chains . METHODS Clathrin Purification . Coated vesicles were isolated from calf brains ( 1 ) , and the clathrin was solubilized by incubation overnight at 4°C in 0 . 8 - 1 . 0 M Tris HCl , pH 7 . 0 / 1 mM EGTA / 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol / 0 . 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PhMeSO2F ) / 0 . 02 % NaN3 . After dilution with 1 vol of water , lipid vesicles and other membrane residues were removed by two centrifugations ( 41 , 000 rpm , 60 min , Beckman type 42 ro - tor ) . Clathrin was precipitated from the supernatant by addi - tion of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 50 % sat - urated , collected by centrifugation , and redissolved in the same concentrated Tris buffer . The remaining ammonium sulfate was removed by dialysis against 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl pH 7 . 0 / 1 mM EGTA / 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol / 0 . 5 mM PhMeSO2F / 0 . 02 % NaN3 . The final gel filtration purification was carried out as described ( 1 ) . Immunization and Production of Anticlathrin Monoclonal Antibodies . Female BALB / c mice were immunized with pu - rified clathrin . An initial subcutaneous injection of 50 , ug com - plete in Freund ' s adjuvant was followed by subcutaneous in - jections of 50 , g and 100 , ug in incomplete Freund ' s adjuvant 5 and 11 wk later and by intraperitoneal injection of 50 , ug in incomplete Freund ' s adjuvant 15 wk later ( 7 days before fu - sion ) . On days 4 , 3 , and 2 before fusion , one mouse received 50 - 100 , tg of clathrin , both intravenously and intraperitoneally ( 10 ) . Anticlathrin antibodies were present 6 . 5 wk after im - munization in the sera of all mice , at titers of 1 : 640 when tested by radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) . Spleen cells from one mouse were fused with 107 SP2 / O - Agl4 myeloma cells in 50 % polyethylene glycol 1500 / RPMI 1640 medium ( 11 ) . Supernatants from wells containing hybridomas were tested by RIA ( see below ) . Cells from positive wells were grown in mass culture for 2 months , and four cultures retaining anticlathrin activity were cloned by using a fluorescence - activated cell sorter ( 12 ) . Of the cloned lines , CVC . 1 , CVC . 6 , and CVC . 7 produced IgGl , IgGl , and IgG2a , respectively , as shown by binding of ' 25I - labeled anti - allotype monoclonal antibodies 20 - 8 . 3 and 20 - 9 . 10 ( 13 ) . The other cloned line produced IgM , which was difficult to characterize because of high background binding . IgG - producing lines were passaged as ascites tumors in BALB / c mice , and 100 - 150 ml of ascites was obtained for each clone . IgG was purified from each pool of ascites as described ( 14 ) . Initial ammonium sulfate precipitates were purified on Sephadex G - 150 or G - 200 to give 80 - 90 % pure preparations of immunoglobulin . Cell Culture . The SP2 / O - Agl4 myeloma line was passaged in RPMI 1640 medium / 10 % fetal calf serum containing peni - cillin and streptomycin ( 100 units / ml each ) and 0 . 1 mM 8 - aza - guanine ( left out two passages before fusion ) ( 15 ) . Hybridoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium / 10 % fetal calf serum supplemented with hypoxanthine / aminopterin / thymidine . Fused myeloma and spleen cells were seeded in 24 - well plates ( Linbro ) with irradiated ( 3 , 000 rads ; 1 rad = 0 . 01 gray ) human fibroblasts as a feeder layer . Feeders were also used in early Abbreviations : LC - A and LC - B , light chains of clathrin ; RIA , radioim - munoassay ; Tris / NaCl , 10 mM Tris ' HCl / 0 . 9 % NaCl , pH 7 . 5 ; Ph - MeSO2F , phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride . 2481 The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

Cells were cloned in 96 - well microtiter plates ( Falcon ) with mouse peritoneal cells ( 106 per plate ) as feeders ( 17 ) . Hybridoma cells were passaged directly from hypoxanthine / aminopterin / thymidine - containing me - dium into BALB / c mice primed with 0 . 5 ml of Pristane by in - traperitoneal injection of 5 X 106 cells per mouse . Ascites fluid was collected by peritoneal puncture into heparin ( 10 units / ml ) and centrifuged at 1 , 500 rpm for 10 min . The supernatant was stored frozen in 0 . 02 % NaN3 at - 20 ' C and the cells were in - jected into additional mice . Antibody Assays . Iodination . " 2I - Labeled rabbit anti - mouse IgG F ( ab ' ) 2 fragments and " 2I - labeled clathrin were prepared using chloramine - T ( 18 ) .

A . Herzenberg ( 13 ) . Indirect RIA . RIA was carried out as in ref . 19 . The initial clathrin concentration was 20 - 30 Ag / ml . Electrophoretic blotting . Clathrin and coated vesicle pro - teins were separated by 10 % NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 20 ) . The gel was cut into strips , and proteins were transferred by electrophoresis to nitrocellulose paper ( 0 . 45 - , m pore size ) in 20 % methanol / 25 mM Tris . HCl / 192 mM gly - cine , pH 8 . 3 ( 21 ) . One paper was stained in Amido black , and the others were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in 10 mM Tris . HCI / 0 . 9 % NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ( Tris / NaCl ) / 3 % bovine serum albumin and then for 5 hr at room temperature with monoclonal antibody at 9 jig / ml in Tris / NaCI / 3 % bovine serum albumin / 5 % heat - in - activated rabbit serum . Papers were washed with 50 - ml por - tions of Tris / NaCl , 0 . 5 M NaCl / Tris / NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / Tris / NaCl , Tris / NaCl , and 1 % bovine serum albumin / Tris / NaCl , labeled with 125I - RAM ( 106 cpm , 100 ng / ml ) for 3 hr at room temperature , washed five times in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / Tris / NaCl , dried , and exposed to Kodak XAR - 5 film . Immunoprecipitation . Clathrin ( 25 , g in 5 - 15 , ul ) was in - cubated with CVC . 7 ( 1 , ul at 20 mg / ml ) at 4°C for 2 to 3 hr and then 15 , ul of goat anti - mouse IgG ( 10 mg / ml , Boehringer - Mannheim ) was added . After 1 - 1 . 5 hr at 4°C , 130 , l of buffer was added and the mixture was centrifuged in an Airfuge ( Beckman ) for 20 min at room temperature and 100 , 000 rpm . Immunoprecipitated complexes and the remaining supernatant were assayed by NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gel electropho - resis ( 20 ) . Immediately before the reaction with the monoclonal antibody , aggregates and self - assembled cages were removed by centrifugation in the Airfuge . Buffers used were 50 mM phosphate , pH 7 . 8 / 100 mM triethanolamine , pH 7 . 8 , or 500 mM Tris HCI , pH 7 . 2 / 1 mM EDTA / 0 . 5 mM PhMeSO2F / 0 . 02 % NaN3 . Electron microscopy . Single molecules were visualized by rotary shadowing ( 22 ) . Samples at 40 - 80 nmol of protein in 45 % glycerol / 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica , dried at reduced pressure , and rotary shadowed with Pt at a glancing angle of 7 . 5° . Preparations were examined at80kVinaJEOL 100 CXII . Clathrin - antibody complexes . We have used two methods to prepare specimens for electron microscopy . In one approach , clathrin at = 2 . 0 mg / ml and antibody are incubated together at 2 - 5 : 1 ( mol / mol ) , and then diluted 1 : 50 with 45 % glycerol / 50 mM Tris HCl , pH 7 . 4 ( 4°C ) , dispersed , and shadowed directly . In the other , a large excess of antibody is used , and free an - tibody is removed by rapid gel filtration through a small column of Ultrogel ACA - 22 ( LKB ) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris HCl , pH 7 . 4 / 1 mM EGTA in a 1 - ml graduated pipette . Drops that appear after 15 min , corresponding to the void volume , are diluted 1 : 1 with 90 % glycerol / 100 mM Tris HCl , pH 7 . 4 , and visualized as described . It is necessary to work quickly to avoid dissociation of the complex . RESULTS Monoclonal Antibodies to Clathrin . Four hybridoma cell lines were obtained producing monoclonal antibodies specific for na - tive clathrin . The three IgG - producing lines - CVC . 1 , CVC . 6 , and CVC . 7 - were used in this study . Elastase treatment selectively degrades light chains ( 1 ) , and an indication that antigenic sites for all three monoclonal IgG are on light chains came from the observation that mild elastase proteolysis of clathrin strongly reduced antibody binding . The NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of a se - ries of elastase digests of clathrin and the corresponding bind - ing characteristics for CVC . 7 are shown in Fig . 1 . Similar re - sults were obtained with CVC . 1 and CVC . 6 ( data not shown ) . Electrophoretic blotting gives more direct evidence that all three antibodies recognize a site on LC - A ( Fig . 2 ) . There is strong labeling of the Mr 36 , 000 band ( LC - A ) and faint labeling of an additional band , just below LC - B . We believe that this latter band represents a proteolytic cleavage product of one or both light chains , since its strength increases with time of storage of any clathrin preparation . Localization of the Antigenic Region of LC - A Along an Arm of the Clathrin Pinwheel . Electron microscopy of rotary - shad - owed complexes of clathrin trimers and anti - LC - A monoclonal antibodies locates the determinant at the proximal end of a clathrin arm . A field of clathrin - CVC . 1 complex is shown in Fig . 3A . The sample was prepared by directly shadowing a mix - ture containing a 2 - molar excess of clathrin . The antibody can in some cases be recognized as a trilobal structure attached to the arm , in others simply by its overall dimensions . Free an - tibodies provide control images ( open arrow ) . The arms of na - tive clathrin have relatively uniform thickness , facilitating iden - tification of the antibody . Clear images were scored according to the location of the bound antibody ( Table 1 ) . Some images A HC - - WS ! : : S , 2 Ift LCA - - LC LC I - B a IL 1 2 3 4 5 6 FIG . 1 .

( See Fig . 3 . ) tElastase - treated clathrin ( 10 A . l , 2 . 1 mg / ml ) was incubated with 1 ALl of CVC . 7 ( 2 . 8 mg / ml ) at 40C for " 15 min and the mixture was pre - pared directly for microscopy . three antibodies studied is shown in Fig . 4 . In all cases , the LC - A determinant appears to be close to the trimer center . The specificity of the interaction between clathrin and the monoclonal antibodies was checked by electron microscopy of clathrin with control monoclonal antibodies of the same isotype but directed against the HLA antigen . An example ( Fig . 5 and Table 1 ) shows that most clathrin trimers are free but that oc - casional attached antibody can be seen . One of the antibodies we used ( no . 206 ) tends to bind to the distal end ofclathrin arms ( Table 1 ) . The specificity was also checked by microscopy of elastase - treated clathrin incubated with CVC . 7 ( Table 1 ) . Distribution of Light Chains LC - A and LC - B in the Popu - lation of Clathrin Trimers . The NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the quantitative immunoprecipita - tion of complexes of clathrin trimers and CVC . 7 is shown in Fig . 6 . About 60 % of the clathrin heavy chain is precipitated ( lane 6 ) . This amount , estimated in several independent ex - periments , is consistent with the expected fraction of trimers that , on a random model , have one or more copies of LC - A . A B i , ; 0 FIG . 5 . Electron microscopy of clathrin trimers incubated with a monoclonal antibody not specific to clathrin . Clathrin ( 10 1l , 2 . 1 mg / ml ) was mixed with anti - HLA monoclonal antibody Wb / 32 ( 1 , ul , 1 . 3 mg / ml ) and rotary shadowed . Most ofthe clathrin trimers are free , but occasional molecules ( circles ) show bound antibodies at various sites . ( Bar = 1 , 000 A . ) Moreover , while LC - A is absent from trimers that remain in the supernatant ( lane 5 ) , the pellet has a LC - A / LC - B ratio of approximately 1 : 1 ( lane 6 ) . If the two species of light chains are distributed randomly on heavy chain arms , there will be four classes of trimers and they will have LC - A / LC - B ratios of 3 : 0 , 2 : 1 , 1 : 2 , and 0 : 3 . The population of trimers in each class can be calculated from the binomial distribution as rt3 : 3r2 : 3r : 1 , where r is the overall LC - A / LC - B ratio in the sample . Since in our clathrin preparations , r = 1 / 2 , the expected fractions are 0 . 04 , 0 . 22 , 0 . 44 , and 0 . 30 , respectively . The first three classes are the only ones expected to precipitate with monoclonal antibody to LC - A . The precipitated clathrin , 70 % of the total , should con - tain LC - A and LC - B in molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 1 , in agreement with results in Fig . 6 . Alternative models for light - chain distribution are ruled out . If every trimer contained one LC - A and two LC - B , the light chain ratio would not be different in the immu - noprecipitate , which should contain most if not all the clathrin . The results likewise rule out two distinct populations ofclathrin trimers , each with only LC - A or only LC - B , because this model predicts that only one - third of the clathrin will complex with anti - LC - A and that no LC - B will appear in the precipitate . We therefore conclude that light chains LC - A and LC - B are dis - tributed in a close to random fashion .

NaDodSO4 ( 12 % ) / polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitated clathrin .

The determinant is located near the proximal end of an arm . We emphasize that the micro - graphs give information only about the determinant recog - nized , not about the entire light chain . If LC - A has a relatively globular structure , the complete polypeptide will be localized in this region . A much more extended structure could span part or most of an arm . Images of unidirectionally shadowed light chains suggest that they are somewhat elongated molecules , 50 - 100 A long ( unpublished data ) . Since each heavy chain has one and only one bound light chain ( 1 ) , symmetry arguments suggest that LC - B will bind at positions homologous to those occupied by LC - A . An alternative approach to light chain lo - calization has been taken by Ungewickell et al . ( 25 ) , who have reconstituted clathrin from separated light and heavy chains after modification of isolated light chains with biotin . They find that ferritin - conjugated avidin then labels the center of trimers . What is the function of clathrin light chains ? Chemical cross - linking experiments give no evidence for inter - light chain con - tact ( 1 ) . Thus , despite their central location , light chains do not appear to contribute to interactions between arms within a tri - mer . Other possible functions include mediation of interaction with cytoplasmic or membrane - associated structures and sta - bilization of assembly . The interdigitated arrangement of trimer arms in cages ( 1 , 7 ) appears not to prevent immunoaggregation by CVC . 7 of coated vesicles or in vitro - assembled clathrin cages , as judged by elec - tron microscopy of negatively stained samples ( unpublished ob - servation ) . This accessibility of the light chain determinant in the assembled structure suggests that it lies on the surface of a coated vesicle and that it could make contact with other cy - toplasmic molecules . The apparently random distribution of the two light chain species is puzzling and difficult to reconcile with a regulatory role in assembly . A possibility we cannot at present rule out is that an originally homogeneous distribution ( 1 : 2 on all trimers ) has been randomized in the course of purification . A step at which this might occur is the dissociation oftrimers from coated vesicles . Nonetheless , the purified clathrin is competent to reassemble into well - defined closed cages . Further under - standing must await determination of structural relationships between LC - A and LC - B . We are grateful to Dr .
