An emerging aspect of regulation is the incorporation of subunit isoforms into Arp2 / 3 complex . Specifically , both isoforms of the ArpC5 subunit , ArpC5 and ArpC5L , have been reported to fine - tune nucleation activity and branch junction stability . Elevated levels of ArpC5 have also been linked to increased cancer progression and metastasis . Here , we have combined genetic engineering of cells and cellular structural biology to describe how ArpC5 and ArpC5L differentially regulate cell migration . They do so by defining the structural stability of ArpC1 in branch junctions and , in turn , by determining protrusion characteristics , protein dynamics , and actin network ultrastructure . ArpC5 isoforms also have an impact on the positioning of actin assembly factors from the Ena / VASP family , which act downstream of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated nucleation . This suggests that ArpC5 and Ena / VASP proteins , both predictors for poor outcome in cancer , are part of a signaling pathway enhancing cell migration and , by inference , metastasis . Introduction The actin filament nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex is involved in essential cellular processes such as endocytosis , cell shape control , DNA repair , and cell migration ( 1 – 3 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex also plays important roles in pathological conditions , such as in the actin cytoskeleton - dependent motility of selected viruses and bacteria or cancer metastasis ( 4 – 7 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex , consisting of the two actin - related proteins ( Arp ) 2 and Arp3 and five scaffolding subunits ArpC1 - 5 ( Figure 1A ) , generates branched actin networks via nucleating new daughter actin filaments on the sides of pre - existing mother filaments ( 2 , 8 – 11 ) . This leads to the formation of so - called actin filament Arp2 / 3 complex branch junctions showing a defined geometry of ~ 70 ° ( 10 , 12 – 16 ) . As the Arp2 / 3 complex is able to nucleate its own substrate , branched actin networks are potentially capable of exponential growth . This requires Arp2 / 3 complex activity to be tightly regulated to determine actin network turnover and stability , with regulation occurring both upstream and downstream of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branch junction formation ( 5 ) . Specifically , Arp2 / 3 complex activation is driven by nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) , such as members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family . In addition , Cortactin binds to branch junctions to increase their stability and might enhance the release of NPFs ( 17 ) . Inhibitors of Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin assembly include Arpin ( 18 ) , Coronin ( 19 ) or glia maturation factor ( GMF ) ( 20 ) , all of which act at different stages of the Arp2 / 3 complex activity cycle , from interfering with NPF - activation to branch junction disassembly . Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation activity is also determined by post - translational modifications or isoform specificity of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits . The Arp2 / 3 complex is not a uniform macromolecular entity but can exist in eight different subunit compositions , caused by the presence of Arp3a / Arp3b , ArpC1a / ArpC1b , and ArpC5 / ArpC5L subunit variants ( commonly referred to as isoforms in the literature ) . This compositional heterogeneity of the Arp2 / 3 complex allows for a fine - tuned nucleation activity and branch junction stability ( 21 – 23 ) . Importantly , certain ArpC5 - ArpC1 - isoform combinations seem to be preferentially assembled into one complex ( 21 ) . Together , these mechanisms define the overall activity of the complex in in vitro reconstituted actin networks or in Vaccinia Virus ( VACV ) actin tails in infected cells , with ArpC1a and ArpC5 being associated with lower Arp2 / 3 activity compared to the combination of ArpC1b and ArpC5L ( 24 ) . Specifically , Arp2 / 3 complex isoform - specific activity was described to depend on the preferred stabilization of ArpC5L - containing branches by Cortactin against 2 Coronin - induced debranching ( Abella et al . 2016 ) . However , it can be anticipated that additional regulatory layers beyond Cortactin stabilization of isoform - specific branch junctions are at play to modulate Arp2 / 3 complex activity . Single - particle cryo - EM of ArpC1a / ArpC5 and ArpC1b / ArpC5L - containing recombinant Arp2 / 3 complexes showed slightly different stability of the ArpC5 isoforms in the inactive complex but did not otherwise reveal substantial structural differences in the different Arp2 / 3 complex variants . This suggests that their specific activities either result from different energetic barriers for activation ( 2 ) or that major structural differences , which cause changes in nucleation activity , are only prevalent in the active conformation of the Arp2 / 3 complex within the branch junction . In a more recent study , the isoform - specific regulation of the Arp2 / 3 complex was extended to Arp3 by showing that the methionine monooxygenase MICAL2 enhances branched network disassembly by oxidizing Arp3b - containing Arp2 / 3 complexes ( 22 ) . These exciting findings warrant further studies to identify isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complex interactions with proteins upstream or downstream of branch junction nucleation . Moreover , a better understanding is required of how isoform - specific properties of the Arp2 / 3 complex might differ among biological systems . Intriguingly , the ArpC5L isoform has been shown to increase Arp2 / 3 complex activity ( Abella et al . 2016 ) , a trait normally associated with enhanced cell migration and metastasis ( 25 – 28 ) . In contrast , elevated ArpC5 levels have been linked to cancer progression ( Kinoshita et al . 2012 ; Xiong and Luo 2018 ; Huang et al . 2021 ) , as ArpC5 depletion reduces motility and invasiveness of carcinoma cells ( Kinoshita et al . 2012 ) . This raises the question if and how ArpC5 / 5L isoforms uniquely affect actin networks involved in cell migration and thus metastasis . An established model to study the regulation of branched actin networks in cell motility is the lamellipodium , a thin sheet - like protrusion at the leading edge of migrating cells , densely filled with branch junctions ( 29 – 31 ) . The prototypical initiation of lamellipodia depends on the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex via the NPF WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) . Polymerization at free barbed ends of Arp2 / 3 complex - nucleated filaments is potentially enhanced by the activity of actin filament elongating proteins of the Ena / VASP family ( Breitsprecher et al . , 2008 ; Damiano - Guercio et al . , 2020 ; Faix and Rottner , 2022 ) . However , it should also be noted that Ena / VASP proteins can potentially counteract lamellipodial Arp2 / 3 complex accumulation , as implied by genetic Ena / VASP disruption ( 32 ) . Due to their morphological simplicity and their accessibility to a large variety of experimental approaches , lamellipodia have been used as model systems across different disciplines , from cell biology to structural biology . Genetic engineering of migratory cell lines via CRISPR / Cas9 has been successfully used to delineate lamellipodium formation and to understand the activity of several important actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , such as WAVE and its isoforms ( 33 ) , Lamellipodin ( 34 ) or FMNL subfamily formins ( 35 ) and the capping protein regulator Twinfilin ( 36 ) . The lamellipodium has also been used extensively to study the ultrastructure and topology of actin networks under varying experimental conditions using electron microscopy approaches ( 16 , 29 , 30 , 37 – 40 ) . We have recently been able to exploit the high number of branch junctions in lamellipodia in a cellular structural biology approach using cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) to determine the structure of the actin filament Arp2 / 3 complex branch junction to subnanometer resolution ( 13 ) . This allowed for a more precise understanding of the structural transitions that occur upon Arp2 / 3 complex activation and interactions that are formed with actin mother and daughter filament . The structural description of the branch junction has been recently extended to a 3 . 9 Å resolution single - particle cryo - EM structure of in vitro reconstituted actin filament Arp2 / 3 complex branch junctions ( 12 ) . However , as the branches observed in our previous in situ study or in the aforementioned in vitro work both contained all possible Arp2 / 3 complex isoform compositions , no insights into isoform - specific branch junction structures could be obtained . To explore ArpC5 isoform - dependent actin network organization and related emergent cell migration characteristics , which are expected to play different roles in cancer progression , we chose a multiscale approach combining recent developments in genetic engineering of cells and cellular structural biology . This offered the opportunity to integrate high - resolution information on isoform - specific branch junction structures and the resulting ultrastructural cytoskeleton architectures with Arp2 / 3 complex isoform - specific cellular morphology , actin network dynamics , and ABP - localization . To this end , we have generated KO cell lines lacking either one or both of the ArpC5 / 5L isoforms and describe across multiple experimental scales how the two distinct ArpC5 isoforms differentially regulate branched actin networks in cell migration . We reveal that incorporating a specific ArpC5 isoform into the Arp2 / 3 complex determines lamellipodial protrusion characteristics , protein dynamics , and actin network ultrastructure . While cells exclusively containing ArpC5L exhibited narrower and less protrusive 3 lamellipodia , ArpC5 - containing cells displayed even wider lamellipodia than wildtype ( WT ) cells . In explaining this phenotype , our data suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex is not merely a nucleator of actin filaments but also influences actin elongation characteristics in an ArpC5 / 5L isoform - dependent fashion , e . g . , by defining the positioning of actin filament elongation proteins of the Ena / VASP family at the leading edge . Our results provide novel insights into why specifically ArpC5 over ArpC5L is associated with enhanced cell motility and therefore linked with increased cancer progression and metastasis ( 41 – 43 ) . Results ArpC5 isoform composition determines protrusion morphology To explore the role of the two ArpC5 isoforms in lamellipodia architecture and cell migration , we used a CRISPR / Cas9 knockout ( KO ) approach ( 44 ) to generate B16 - F1 mouse melanoma cells lacking either ArpC5 ( referred to as C5KO ) , ArpC5L ( C5LKO ) or both isoforms ( C5 / C5LKO ) . For all generated cell lines , successful KO was verified in three independent clones via genomic sequencing ( Figure S1 ) and confirmation of complete depletion of ArpC5 and / or ArpC5L protein levels by Western blotting ( Figure S2A ) . Double KO cell lines lacking both ArpC5 and ArpC5L isoforms were completely devoid of lamellipodia ( Figure S3 ) . These results indicate that the actin assembly activity of Arp2 / 3 complexes lacking an ArpC5 subunit reported in vitro ( 45 ) is insufficient to maintain branched actin networks in lamellipodia . Single isoform KO cells revealed opposing lamellipodial phenotypes ( Figure 1B - J ) . While C5KO cells exhibited significantly narrower lamellipodia than B16 - F1 wildtype ( WT ) cells ( Figure 1F ) , the lamellipodial width of C5LKOs was significantly increased ( Figure 1J ) . To corroborate our observations of these isoform - specific lamellipodia phenotypes , we generated ArpC5 and ArpC5L KOs in the Rat2 fibroblast cell line ( Figures S1 , S2B ) . Loss of either isoform in Rat2 cells resulted in lamellipodial phenotypes identical to B16 - F1 cells ( Figure S4 ) , demonstrating that observed effects are consistent across at least two different species and cell types . As all lines of a given KO showed consistent phenotypes , we continued our experiments with one selected individual clone for each condition ( for B16 - F1 C5KO # 17 , 5L KO # 16 , C5 / C5LKO # 20 , and for Rat2 C5KO # 4 and C5LKO # 11 ) . We transiently transfected cells with dual expression plasmids encoding either RFP alone , RFP and ArpC5L , or RFP and ArpC5 and quantified the lamellipodium width of transfected cells as identified by RFP expression . In this setup , only the construct expressing ArpC5 was able to rescue the lamellipodium phenotype of C5KO cells , resulting in wildtype - like cells ( Figure 2C - D ) . In contrast , transfection with the ArpC5L - encoding construct did not rescue lamellipodia width ( Figure 2B , D ) . Repeating the same transfection approach in the C5 / C5LKO background ( Figure 2E - H ) confirmed these observations and also the functionality of our ArpC5 Figure 1 : ArpC5 isoforms affect lamellipodium morphology ( A ) Schematic representation of the branch junction highlighting the positions of the individual Arp2 / 3 complex subunits within this assembly .

All scale bars , 20µm 4 and ArpC5L encoding vectors , since the expression of ArpC5L or ArpC5 in double KO cells again resulted in the establishment of narrow or wide lamellipodia , respectively ( Figure 2H ) . Considering that a reduction of ArpC5 protein levels via knockdown had been shown to decrease the abundance of ArpC1a in HeLa cells ( 21 ) , we tested whether , in C5KO or C5LKO cells , the levels of other Arp2 / 3 subunits were affected as well , potentially altering overall Arp2 / 3 complex activity . We qualitatively assessed the relative abundance of Arp3 , Arp2 , ArpC1b , and ArpC1a in B16 - F1 and Rat2 single KO lines ( Figure S5 ) . While we also observed a reduction in ArpC1a levels in B16 - F1 C5KO and Rat2 C5KO cells , we did not see a drastic change in Arp3 or Arp2 abundance , indicating that overall Arp2 / 3 complex levels should not be altered as compared to the respective wildtype cell lines . As the results of the rescue experiments were consistent with ArpC5 and ArpC5L having isoform - specific functions in a lamellipodial context , we explored the putative mechanisms mediating the observed differences . Such mechanisms can include altered Arp2 / 3 complex protein levels ( which we could partially already rule out , Figure S5 ) , selective interactions with Arp2 / 3 complex regulators , ultrastructural alterations in the architecture of branched actin networks , structural differences of Arp2 / 3 complex branch junctions resulting in differences in branch nucleation activity , stabilization , and turnover , or – finally - differential recruitment of downstream factors . WAVE 1 and 2 do not activate the Arp2 / 3 complex in an ArpC5 isoform - specific manner We first sought to examine whether upstream regulators of the Arp2 / 3 complex are causative for the observed phenotypes in C5KO and C5LKO cells . The WAVE - regulatory complex ( WRC ) is a central nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) , being crucial for Arp2 / 3 complex activation in canonical lamellipodia ( 46 , 47 ) . Using recently published B16 - F1 WAVE1 and WAVE2 KO cell lines ( 33 ) , we aimed to test whether the two WAVE isoforms expressed in B16 - F1 cells exhibit preferred activation of either ArpC5 or ArpC5L containing Arp2 / 3 complexes . We employed isoform - specific antibodies against ArpC5 and ArpC5L ( Figure S6 ) to detect endogenous ArpC5 and ArpC5L in WAVE1 and WAVE2 KO cells ( Figure S7 ) . ArpC5 and ArpC5L were localized identically at the leading edge in cells lacking either WAVE1 or 2 ( Figure S7D - I ) . This shows that Arp2 / 3 complexes with different ArpC5 isoform compositions are not selectively activated by WAVE1 versus WAVE2 - containing WRCs . In a WAVE1 / 2 double KO cell line , neither ArpC5 nor ArpC5L were detected at the cell periphery ( Figure S7J - L ) , in line with the WRC ' s central role in establishing Arp2 / 3 - dependent protrusions . Cortactin activity does not impact lamellipodia dimension in an ArpC5 isoform - specific fashion Having excluded differential Arp2 / 3 complex activation by the WRC as a central contributor to ArpC5 isoform specificity in lamellipodia , we focused Figure 2 : The lamellipodial C5KO phenotype is mediated by isoform specificity and not by gene dose effects ( A - C ) Representative epifluorescence micrographs of B16 - F1 C5KO cells transfected with pCMV : : empty _ pCMV : : RFP ( A ) , pCMV : : ArpC5L _ pCMV : : RFP ( B ) , pCMV : : ArpC5 _ pCMV : : RFP ( C ) visualizing the actin cytoskeleton using fluorescent phalloidin and verifying transfection via RFP fluorescence .

Cortactin has been described to protect ArpC5L containing branch junctions from Coronin - mediated debranching ( 21 ) . We performed Cortactin knockdowns in B16 - F1 WT , C5KO , and C5LKO cells ( Figure S8 ) . We confirmed the reduction in Cortactin levels at the single cell level by immunostaining ( Figure S8B , D , F , H , J , L ) , as well as at the population level by Western blotting ( Figure S8M ) . We then evaluated changes in lamellipodia phenotypes via phalloidin staining ( Figure S8A , C , E , G , I , K ) . Cortactin knockdown did not result in notable differences in lamellipodia dimensions in WT or ArpC5 and ArpC5L KO cells , reminiscent of previous observations in murine Cortactin KO fibroblasts ( 50 ) , but in contrast to observed changes in Vaccinia virus tail length in HeLa cells depleted of specific ArpC5 isoforms ( 21 ) . We conclude that the changes in lamellipodial dimensions observed upon ArpC5 isoform knockouts are not mediated by differential cortactin activities . ArpC5 isoforms affect VACV actin tail length in a cell type - specific manner Abella and colleagues reported VACV actin tails to be shorter after knockdown of ArpC5L and longer after knockdown of ArpC5 ( 21 ) , respectively , representing an inverse phenotype compared to our observations of lamellipodia width in B16 - F1 ( Figure 1C - J ) and Rat2 ( Figure S4B - G ) KO cell lines . To determine whether the differential effects of ArpC5 isoform depletion on VACV actin tails and lamellipodia represent different regulatory mechanisms between these two experimental systems , we performed VACV tail length measurements in our B16 - F1 and Rat2 WT and KO cell lines ( Figure S9 ) . In infected B16 - F1 cells , VACV tail lengths were reduced in both C5KO and C5LKO cells compared to WT ( Figure S9A - J ) . Interestingly , the tails observed in C5LKO cells were longer than those in C5KO cells . In Rat2 fibroblasts , we observed shorter tails in C5KO cells and longer tails in C5LKO cells compared to WT ( Figure S9K - R ) . Hence , our observations for VACV tail length in an ArpC5 / 5L isoform - specific background are consistent with our lamellipodial phenotypes , although to variable extents when comparing Rat2 versus B16 - F1 cells . Considering our results and existing literature , ArpC5 isoforms clearly affect VACV actin tail formation but might do so in a cell type - specific manner . We interpreted this as clear hint towards additional factors being involved in contributing to the outcome of ArpC5 isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complex activities , not previously anticipated . ArpC5 isoforms differentially regulate actin network architecture and branch junction structure Aiming to understand the differences in the architecture of actin filament networks exhibited by C5KO and C5LKO cells , we used our published cryo - ET specimen preparation protocols ( 13 , 51 ) to acquire tilt - series of vitreously frozen lamellipodia in B16 - F1 WT , C5KO and C5LKO cells ( Figure 3A - C ) . We then performed a quantitative ultrastructural analysis of actin network architectures in all cell types ( Figure 3D - H ) using a recently published workflow ( 52 ) . This analysis revealed clear differences in angular distributions of actin filaments between WT and isoform - specific KO lamellipodia ( Figure 3G - H ) and provided an ultrastructural explanation for the respective lamellipodial phenotypes . In C5KO cells , a larger fraction of filaments was oriented parallel to the leading edge . Such filaments do not contribute to the formation of a prominent network with high width ( 38 ) , but rather promote the narrow appearance of the lamellipodium typical for this genotype ( Figure 1C - F ) . Correspondingly , in ArpC5L KO cells , a larger number of filaments were found to be oriented almost perpendicular to the leading edge ( Figure 3F , H ) , leading to a wider lamellipodium as observed using fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 1G - J ) . One possible explanation for the altered network architectures could be a different nucleation activity of isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complexes , resulting in different numbers of branch junctions . To evaluate this possibility , we exploited the high - resolution molecular information present within our cryo - ET data and used classification - corrected template matching ( see Methods ) to identify branch junctions within our cryo - electron tomograms . We calculated branch junction densities per square micron in lamellipodia of each cell type and found the numbers of branch junctions with medians of 252 . 9 µm - 2 , 242 µm - 2 , and 258 . 7 µm - 2 for WT , C5KO and C5LKO , respectively , to be comparable across all three genotypes ( Figure 3I ) . This is also consistent with our observation that relative abundances of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits are not strongly altered upon removal of either ArpC5 or ArpC5L ( Figure S5 ) . As our results suggested that overall branch junction formation in lamellipodia is not significantly impacted by the selective incorporation of either ArpC5 or ArpC5L , we speculated that the observed differences in Arp2 / 3 complex activity might be caused by structural differences at the level of individual branch junctions . To test this , we performed subtomogram averaging and multi - particle refinement on identified branch junctions , yielding 8 . 0Å , 8 . 1Å , and 7 . 8Å resolution structures of actin filament Arp2 / 3 complex branch 6 Figure 3 : ArpC5 isoforms govern actin network architecture of the lamellipodium and have differential effects on ArpC1 stabilization in the branch junction ( A - C ) Sums of 7 computational slices ( ~ 9 . 5nm thickness ) through cryo - electron tomograms of lamellipodia of B16 - F1 wildtype , C5KO , and C5LKO cells , respectively .

All three structures revealed an overall identical branch geometry of ~ 70 ° and corresponded to recently published models of the Arp2 / 3 complex branch junction ( 12 , 13 ) ( Figure 3J - M , Supplementary Movie S1 ) . While the overall branch junction was unaltered , we did observe a striking difference in the structure derived from C5LKO cells . In this structure , the density of the ArpC1 β - propeller was considerably weaker ( Figure 3L ) , an observation further confirmed by calculating a difference map between branch junction structures derived from C5KO and C5LKO cells ( Figure 3N ) . In contrast , the density for the so - called ArpC1 protrusion helix , which tethers ArpC1 to the actin mother filament ( 12 , 13 ) , displayed an equally strong density among all three structures ( Figure 3J - L , N ) . These observations suggest that the lack of ArpC1 density in the C5LKO structure is not due to reduced occupancy , but could be due to decreased stability or increased flexibility in its β - propeller region . Our finding that branch junctions in cells lacking ArpC5L display higher flexibility is partially in line with the observation that ArpC5L - containing branches are suggested to be preferentially stabilized by Cortactin ( 21 ) . However , the lack of effects on lamellipodium width upon Cortactin depletion in our isoform - specific KO cells ( Figure S8 ) points towards additional mechanisms of branch junction stabilization . ArpC5 isoforms define lamellipodial actin network dynamics and protrusion characteristics To explore how ArpC5 and ArpC5L regulate actin network dynamics in lamellipodia , we performed live - cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) assays ( Movie S2 - 4 ) . In random migration assays , B16 - F1 WT and ArpC5LKO cells exhibited comparable average velocities , while C5KO cells were significantly slower ( Figure 4A ) . Correspondingly , C5KO cells , while exhibiting comparable retrograde flow to WT , displayed significantly lower protrusion velocity and thus lower total actin polymerization rate ( Figure 4B - E ) . In contrast , C5LKO cells exhibited a stronger retrograde flow while having comparable overall polymerization rates to WT cells ( Figure 4B - E ) . Even though this meant that both KO cell lines exhibited a lower protrusion efficiency than WT ( Figure 4F ) , the considerably higher polymerization rate found in C5LKO compared to C5KO ( Figure 4E ) again clearly marked a difference between the two isoforms and is well in line with the wider lamellipodia observed in C5LKO compared to WT ( Figure 1J ) .

As we already determined that the number of branch junctions is comparable in all cell lines ( Figure 3I ) and previous work established that ArpC5L - containing Arp2 / 3 complexes can mediate more efficient actin assembly and branching ( 21 ) , we excluded that Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent de - novo nucleation of filaments is impaired . Instead , we speculated whether ArpC5 and ArpC5L - containing lamellipodia might exhibit differences in actin filament elongation . We , therefore , hypothesized that ArpC5 / 5L isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complexes might be able to regulate the localization and / or activity of actin filament elongating proteins . We thus tested for the presence of the Ena / VASP family proteins at the leading edge ( 53 ) . Indeed , Mena ( Figure 5A - F ) and VASP ( Figure 5G - L ) accumulated at the leading edges of B16 - F16 WT ( Figure 5A - B , G - H ) and C5LKO cells ( Figure 5E - F , K - L ) , but not in C5KO cells ( Figure 5C - D , I - J ) . We corroborated these results via quantification ( Figure 5M - O ) and found the same pattern in Rat2 WT , C5KO , and C5LKO cells ( Figure S11 ) . To determine if the reduced localization of Mena and VASP is a specific effect of incorporation of ArpC5 isoforms into branch junctions and not a mere consequence of the reduced lamellipodium phenotype itself , we tested for the localization of additional lamellipodial tip components determining protrusion and lamellipodia formation . We observed a very minor reduction of WAVE2 localization at the leading edges of both C5KO and C5LKO ( Figure S12 ) in stark contrast to the almost complete reduction of Mena and VASP in ArpC5KOs . These results provide evidence that the reduced localization of Ena / VASP family members is not simply dependent on the extent of active lamellipodial protrusion . Instead , it suggests that isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complex subpopulations are directly capable of affecting the distribution of specific downstream effectors to determine actin filament elongation . Discussion We have used an integrated cell and structural biology Figure 5 : ArpC5 isoforms modulate Mena / VASP recruitment to the leading edge ( A - L ) Representative epifluorescence micrographs of B16 - F1 wildtype ( A , B , G , H ) , C5KO ( C , D , I , J ) , and C5LKO ( E , F , K , L ) cells visualizing the actin cytoskeleton using fluorescent phalloidin ( A , C , E , G , I , K ) and the localization of Mena ( B , D , F ) and VASP ( H , J , L ) by immunofluorescence .

We show that C5KO cells exhibit impaired motility and lamellipodia formation , strongly altered actin architecture , and reduced recruitment of actin filament elongators of the Ena / VASP family to the leading edge ( Figure 6 ) . These results indicate that ArpC5 isoform composition can act as regulator of actin polymerization efficiency in lamellipodia through altering the extent of Ena / VASP protein accumulation at the leading edge . Our findings further suggest that the Ena / VASP - dependent elongation of ArpC5 - containing Arp2 / 3 complex nucleated filaments is able to overcome the reduced nucleation efficiency of ArpC5 - containing Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Figure 6 ) ( 21 , 23 ) . This correlation between ArpC5 isoform levels and changed Ena / VASP localization provides a molecular explanation for the observation that elevated ArpC5 expression is associated with increased metastasis and poorer overall survival in different cancers ( 41 – 43 , 54 ) . It is further well in line with the observation that Ena / VASP protein levels and activity are also associated with cancer progression ( 55 – 57 ) . It is intriguing to speculate how an Arp2 / 3 complex of a given isoform - composition is able to define the elongation properties of the filament it has nucleated . Does ArpC5 specifically support the delivery of Ena / VASP , or does ArpC5L prevent the association of these elongation factors with barbed actin filament ends ? A prior in vitro study using tissue - derived Arp2 / 3 complex reported the importance of the source tissue of Arp2 / 3 complex , which can determine the effects of VASP on WAVE - dependent actin polymerization ( 58 ) . In the presence of thymus - derived Arp2 / 3 complex ( high ArpC5 / ArpC5L ratio ) , VASP boosted the otherwise low actin polymerization speed significantly . In contrast , VASP lowered the polymerization of actin in the presence of brain - derived Arp2 / 3 complexes ( low ArpC5 / ArpC5L ratio ) , which appeared to have higher baseline nucleation activity . These findings suggest an antagonistic cross - regulation between ArpC5L and Ena / VASP proteins in WAVE - dependent actin networks , which is consistent with our observations . However , further studies are needed to fully unravel the cross - regulation between variable isoform - dependent Arp2 / 3 complex activities and the resulting downstream actin filament elongation of newly nucleated filaments . Despite their isoform - specific differences , the shared functions of ArpC5 and ArpC5L are vital for Arp2 / 3 activity in cells , as we can show that lack of both isoforms results in complete depletion of lamellipodia ( Figure S3 ) . In addition , earlier studies have shown the roles of ArpC5 / 5L in Arp2 / 3 complex assembly , stabilization , and nucleation activity ( 21 , 23 , 45 ) . In vitro reconstitution experiments suggested that ArpC5 / ArpC5L are involved in integrating ArpC1 into the complex ( 45 ) . Our structures of isoform - specific branch junctions obtained from cells further emphasize such a functional connection between ArpC1 and ArpC5 / ArpC5L , as we observe an increased destabilization of ArpC1 within ArpC5 - containing Figure 6 : Schematic summary ArpC5 isoform - dependent regulation of lamellipodium characteristics and cell migration Schematic representation of the phenotypes observed for C5KO and C5LKO cells and of how altered actin filament polymerization velocities caused by differential recruitment of Mena / VASP overcomes the intrinsically different nucleation speeds of the associated Arp2 / 3 complexes . 10 Arp2 / 3 complex branch junctions . Nevertheless , we cannot comment on whether this affects either one or both of the ArpC1 isoforms present in the branch junction . Weakened interfaces between ArpC1 and ArpC5 could be causative for the observed increase in ArpC1 flexibility . However , the resolution of our structures is too low to unambiguously define the interactions that form the ArpC1 / ArpC5 interface . A recent single - particle cryo - EM study solving structures of in vitro reconstituted , inactive Arp2 / 3 complexes at resolutions between 4 and 5 Å showed increased flexibility of ArpC5L compared to ArpC5 . Still , this observation cannot fully explain a changed ArpC1 stability as we did observe stable ArpC1 in ArpC5L - containing branches . We also did not observe pronounced differences in the densities between ArpC5 and ArpC5L in our isoform - specific branch junction reconstructions from cells . This suggests that ArpC5 isoforms might be differentially stabilized in the inactive and active Arp2 / 3 complex and that the stabilization of ArpC1 might not be entirely dependent on ArpC5 isoforms . Coronins are known to promote debranching , and it was suggested that multimeric Coronin1B replaces Arp2 / 3 complexes at the branch junction ( 19 ) . ArpC1 and Coronin share a similar beta - propeller fold , allowing to hypothesize that there might be a competitive displacement of ArpC1 by Coronin depending on which ArpC5 isoform is incorporated into the Arp2 / 3 complex . However , what specifically regulates ArpC1 stability and how ArpC1 stability affects the branch junction as a whole still needs to be established . Future structural studies , either in vitro on reconstituted , active Arp2 / 3 complexes ( 12 , 59 ) or in situ , can provide further insights into how ArpC1 and ArpC5 isoform - specific branches are regulated by branch junction stabilizing proteins , such as Cortactin or branch junction - disassembling proteins , such as GMF ( 60 ) and Coronin 1b . Our results show that the ArpC5 isoform is clearly associated with more prolific actin assemblies in lamellipodia of Rat2 fibroblasts and B16 - F1 melanoma cells . These observations are in line with recently published work revealing that ArpC5 has the same effect in peripheral actin rings of CD4 T cells ( 61 ) . This supports the notion that ArpC5 / 5L isoform - specific activities on cellular actin networks are generalizable over different cell types and species . However , ArpC5 / 5L isoforms showed cell - type - specific differences in VACV actin tail formation in B16 - F1 melanoma cells , Rat2 fibroblast , and HeLa cells . Specifically , in HeLa cells , the ArpC5 / 5L isoform - dependent actin tail length phenotype was inverted compared to B16 - F1 and Rat 2 cells . We note that different cell lines can have different protein expression levels for the ArpC5 isoforms ( Figure S2 , S6 ) . However , our observations that overexpression of either isoform is not able to rescue isoform - specific KO effects argues that Arp2 / 3 dosage is not the main cause for differing VACV tail lengths in the used cellular systems . Further work is required to establish the molecular determinants that define VACV actin tail formation in different cell lines and species . CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genome editing has revolutionized all aspects of cell biology and offers a substantial potential for cellular structural biology . In the present study , we were able to integrate structural and cell biology assays in one model system to obtain a better understanding of Arp2 / 3 complex regulation . Using cryo - ET and subtomogram averaging on genetically engineered cells , we determined structures of isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complex branch junctions at ~ 8 Å resolution , revealing relevant differences in branch junction stability . This study underscores how the results of cellular cryo - ET can be complemented by a large number of experimental techniques applicable to cells . Furthermore , our work highlights the capabilities of cryo - ET to study challenging biological assemblies , which have remained difficult to study with standard reductionist structural biology approaches ( 62 ) . 11 Acknowledgments This research was supported by the Scientific Service Units ( SSUs ) of ISTA through resources provided by Scientific Computing ( SciComp ) , the Life Science Facility ( LSF ) , the Imaging and Optics facility ( IOF ) and the Electron Microscopy Facility ( EMF ) .

Cell culture and KO line generation Wildtype Mus musculus ( Mm ) B16 - F1 ( RRID : CVCL _ 0158 ) melanoma cells and Rattus norvegicus ( Rn ) Rat2 fibroblasts ( RRID : CVCL _ 0513 ) were used in this study . B16 - F1 cells were cultured in DMEM GlutaMAX ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 31966047 ) , supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 10270106 ) and 1 % ( v / v ) penicillin - streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 15070063 ) . Rat2 fibroblasts were cultured in the same medium with an added 1 % ( v / v ) of 100X MEM Non - Essential Amino Acids Solution ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 11140068 ) . Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 . Detachment of cells prior to seeding was performed with 0 . 05 % ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 25300054 ) and 0 . 25 % ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 25200056 ) trypsin for B16 - F1 cells and Rat2 fibroblasts , respectively . ArpC5 and ArpC5L genes were knocked out individually in B16 - F1 and Rat2 cells by CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genome editing resulting in C5KO and C5LKO lines ( Cong et al . , 2013 ) . The B16 - F1 C5 / C5L double KO lines were generated by disrupting ArpC5 in the B16 - F1 C5LKO # 16 background . The corresponding guide sequences GATATGACGAGAACAAGTTCG for MmArpC5 , GATTCGTAGACGAGCACGAAG for MmArpC5L , GTCGTCGGCCCGCTTCCGGAAGG for RnArpC5 and GATCCACTCGGCGGAAGCGTGAGG for RnArpC5Lwere cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ( Addgene , ID 48139 ) . Cells were transfected employing Lipofectamine™ LTX Reagent with PLUS™ Reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 15338100 ) . 16 h after transfection , cells were reseeded and enriched by selection in their respective media with an added 2 . 5 µg / ml of puromycin for B16 - F1 and 3 µg / ml of puromycin ( Merck # p9620 ) for Rat2 cells , respectively , for 3 d . Surviving cells were diluted ( ~ 1 : 50 ) and incubated in non - selective media to allow for the formation of single - cell - derived colonies . Approximately 7 d after seeding , individual colonies were selected and expanded for genotyping , first by Western blot , then by genomic sequencing of the target loci ( Figures S1 , S2 ) . Western blotting Cyt - Ex buffer containing 22 . 5 % ( v / v ) 4X Laemmli buffer ( Bio Rad , # 1610747 ) , 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) 2 - mercaptoethanol ( Bio Rad , # 1610710 ) , 75 % ( v / v ) Cyt - Ex - Pre buffer ( 10 mM Tris , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) SDS , adjusted to pH 7 . 4 ) and cOmplete™ , EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Merck , # 11873580001 ) was prepared shortly prior to sample extraction . Cells were washed with pre - chilled PBS and lysed with Cyt - Ex buffer on ice for 10 min prior to scraping and incubation at 95 °C for 10 min . For estimating protein concentration , 10 µl of sample were transferred into 100 µl of Amido - Black - Staining solution ( 0 . 25 % ( w / v ) Amido black 10 B ( Merck , # 1011670025 ) ) , 45 % ( v / v ) MeOH , 45 % ( v / v ) ddH2O , 10 % ( v / v ) glacial HOAc . After sedimentation at 20 , 000g for 3 min the supernatant was removed and replaced with 150 µl of Amido - Black - Destaining solution ( 45 % ( v / v ) MeOH , 45 % ( v / v ) ddH2O 10 % ( v / v ) glacial HOAc ) . After another round of sedimentation at 20 , 000 g for 3 min the supernatant was removed and the sediment was dissolved in 200 µl of 0 . 2 M NaOH . 100 µl of the solution was then employed for photometric concentration measurement at 600nm absorption using a TECAN Infinite F500 plate reader ( Tecan ) . 10 µg of extracts per sample were run on SDS – PAGE gels , transferred to PVDF membranes ( AL Labortechnik , 42514 . 01 ) via wet blotting , and blocked in blocking solution ( 4 % ( w / v ) skim milk powder ( Merck , # 70166 - 500G ) and 1 % ( w / v ) BSA ( Merck , # 10735078001 ) in Tris - based saline containing 0 , 05 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) ) at room temperature ( RT ) for 1 h . All following washings were performed in TBST in three 5 min steps . Blots were washed and incubated in primary antibodies solved in Antibody - Dilution solution ( 2 % ( w / v ) BSA and 0 . 02 % ( w / v ) sodium azide in TBST ) at 4 °C overnight . Blots were washed again and incubated in secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution at RT for 45 min . Blots were washed one last time and then stored in TBS until detection . ECL1 solution ( 100µl 250mM Luminol ( Merck , # A8511 - 5G , solved in DMSO ) and 44µl 90mM p - coumaric acid ( Merck , # C9008 - 5G , solved in DMSO ) dissolved in 1ml 1M Tris pH 8 . 5 , then brought to 10 ml with ddH2O ) and ECL2 solution ( 6 µl 30 % ( v / v ) H2O2 ( Merck , # H1009 ) in 10 ml with ddH2O ) were prepared directly prior to application . The chemiluminescence signals were developed in a 1 : 1 mixture of ECL1 and ECL2 . Images 13 were acquired using an Amersham Imager 600 ( GE Healthcare ) . Uncropped versions of all Western blot results are represented in ( Figure S13 ) VACV infection assay For VACV infection assays , cells were infected with VACV ( Western reserve strain , kindly provided by Andreas Bergthaler , Medical University of Vienna ) for 1 h , washed three times with PBS , and incubated in culture medium for another 7 h . VACV infected cells were fixed with pre - warmed 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Merck , # P6148 ) in PBS for 1 h to ensure the inactivation of the virus . The cells were washed three times with PBS and subjected to staining with Phalloidin - Atto594 and a previously characterized monoclonal anti - B5 antibody ( 63 , 64 ) prior to embedding in ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # P36934 ) . Immunofluorescence and phalloidin staining For rescue experiments ( Figure 2 ) , cells were transfected using 300 ng of dual expression plasmid and Lipofectamine™ LTX Reagent with PLUS™ Reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 15338100 ) and incubated 16 h prior to seeding . For immunofluorescence and phalloidin stainings , cells were trypsinized and seeded onto coverslips that were coated with 25 µg / ml laminin ( Merck , # 11243217001 ) in laminin coating buffer ( 50mM TRIS , 150mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) at RT for 1 h . Cells were allowed to settle on coverslips for 16 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 before they were either employed for infection assays or directly fixed . For fixation of non - VACV - infected samples , the medium was aspirated and immediately replaced by pre - warmed 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Merck , # P6148 ) in PBS . After 20 min of fixation , cells were washed twice with PBS prior to being permeabilized via incubation with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 1 min . Permeabilized cells were washed twice with PBS , subjected to the indicated staining , and embedded using ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # P36934 ) . Non - VACV - infected samples were imaged on a Zeiss Axio Imager ( Zeiss ) equipped with a CoolLED p300 SB light source ( CoolLED ) and an LCI Plan - Neofluar 63x / 1 , 3 Imm Corr DIC M27 objective ( Zeiss ) . VACV - infected samples were imaged on a Zeiss Axio Observer ( Zeiss ) equipped with 405 , 488 , 561 , and 640 nm laser lines and a Plan - APOCHROMAT 63x / 1 . 4 Imm Corr DIC Oil M27 objective ( Zeiss ) . Conversion of image formats , generation of merges / overlays , and distance measurements were performed in Fiji v1 . 52p ( 66 ) . Cortactin knockdown For the Cortactin knockdown experiments , cells were transfected in 96 - Well plate wells using either 25 nM siGENOME Non - Targeting Pool # 2 ( Horizon Discovery , # D - 001206 - 14 - 05 ) or 25 nM Cortactin siRNA SMARTPool ( Horizon Discovery , # L - 044721 - 00 - 0005 ) using 0 . 5 µl DharmaFECT 1 Transfection Reagent in a total volume of 100 µl . A second round of transfection of the same cells was performed according to the same protocol after 24 h . Cells were then incubated for 24h and subsequently either seeded for immunostaining onto coverslips that were coated with 25 µg / ml laminin or for Western blot sample preparation into 12 - Well plate wells . Cells were allowed to settle for 24h before they were subjected to immunostaining or Western blot ( for details , see above ) . Random migration assay B16 - F1 cells were seeded onto µ - slide 8 - well glass - bottom microscopy chambers ( Ibidi , # 80807 ) coated with 25 µg / mL laminin . Live - cell time - lapse image series were acquired with an Eclipse - Ti2 ( Nikon ) equipped with a Plan Apo λ 20x / 0 . 75 DIC air PFS objective ( Nikon ) and operated with Nikon ' s NIS - Elements imaging software . A custom - made environment chamber was used to maintain constant conditions of 37 °C and 5 % CO2 . DIC time - lapse images of randomly chosen cell - containing areas were acquired for 15 h every 10 min . Trajectories of individual cells were tracked manually in Fiji v1 . 47v employing the built - in Fiji Manual Tracking plugin . For 14 deriving the average speed of individual cells , trajectories were analyzed using the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool ( Ibidi , https : / / ibidi . com / chemotaxis - analysis / 171 - chemotaxis - and - migration - tool . html ) . Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching ( FRAP ) B16 - F1 cells were transfected with 0 . 5 µg EGFP - β - actin and 1 µL JetPrime transfection reagent ( VWR , # 114 - 07 ) per well in 6 - well plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 16 hours post transfection , cells were seeded onto µ - slide 8 - well glass - bottom microscopy chambers ( Ibidi , # 80427 ) coated with 25 µg / mL laminin as described in the section Immunofluorescence and phalloidin staining . Live - cell time - lapse image series were acquired with a 100x / 1 . 4 apochromatic objective on an inverted Axio Observer ( Zeiss ) featuring an incubation chamber heated to 37°C ( Warner instruments ) , a DG4 light source ( Sutter instruments ) , and a CoolSnap HQ2 camera ( Photometrics ) . Randomly chosen EGFP - actin expressing cells with steadily protruding lamellipodia were imaged at 3 sec per frame with 500 ms exposure time . After 4 - 5 frames , a rectangular region containing a subsection of the lamellipodium was bleached ( see ROIs in Figure 4 ) using a 405 nm diode laser at 80 mW output power , controlled by a 2D - VisiFRAP Realtime scanner and driven by VisiView software ( Visitron Systems ) . Individual recordings were analyzed using Fiji ( v2 . 1 . 0 ) . Image stacks were resliced along a line in the bleached region perpendicular to the cell leading edge , creating a kymograph . Retrograde flow and protrusion rate values were obtained by calculating the speed of the recovering actin network moving back or forth , respectively . The total actin polymerization rate was determined by adding the absolute values of retrograde flow and protrusion rate . The ratio of protrusion to total actin polymerization is expressed as protrusion efficiency . Cryo - electron tomography Cells were trypsinized and seeded onto 200 mesh gold holey carbon grids ( R2 / 2 - 2 C , Quantifoil Micro Tools ) placed in 3D printed grid holders ( 51 ) for cryo - ET specimen preparation . Before seeding , grids were glow discharged using an ELMO glow discharge unit ( Cordouan Technologies ) for 2 min and then coated with 25 µg / ml laminin for 1 h at RT . Cells were allowed to adhere to the grids at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 for 4 h before they were extracted and fixed according to published protocols ( 13 , 16 , 51 ) . In detail , grids were removed from grid holders and placed in 50 μl drops of cytoskeleton buffer ( 10 mM MES , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM glucose , and 5 mM MgCl2 , pH6 . 2 ) supplemented with 0 . 75 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Services , # E16220 ) and 0 . 1 µg / ml phalloidin ( Merck , # P2141 ) for 1 min at RT . Grids were then transferred to 50 μl drops of cytoskeleton buffer containing 2 % ( w / v ) glutaraldehyde and 1 µg / ml phalloidin at RT for 15 min . Subsequently , grids were vitrified using a Leica GP2 plunger ( Leica Microsystems ) with blotting chamber conditions of 80 % humidity and 4 °C . In the blotting chamber , the fixation solution was manually blotted and replaced with 3 μl 10 nm colloidal gold coated with BSA suspended in PBS for WT or 3 μl PBS for C5KO and C5LKO , respectively . After backside blotting for 3 s using the internal blotting sensor of the Leica GP2 , the grids were vitrified in liquid ethane ( −185 °C ) and then stored under liquid nitrogen conditions . Tilt - series were acquired under cryogenic conditions on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Krios G3i TEM equipped with a BioQuantum post - column energy filter and a K3 camera ( Gatan ) , using SerialEM v3 . 8 ( 67 ) . Acquisition of low - and medium - magnification maps allowed for defining areas of interest for subsequent high - resolution tomography data acquisition . Gain reference images were collected before data acquisition . DigitalMicrograph as integrated into the Gatan Microscopy Suite v3 . 3 ( Gatan ) and SerialEM were used for filter and microscope tuning . Tilt - series were acquired with a filter slit width of 20 eV , and using a dose - symmetric tilt - scheme ( 68 ) ranging from −66° to 66° with a 2° increment . The nominal defocus range was set to −1 . 5 to −4 . 5 µm and the nominal magnification to 53 , 000x , resulting in a pixel size of 1 . 693 Å . Tilt - images were acquired as 5 , 760 × 4092 pixel movies of eight frames . The dose per tilt was set to be 2 . 79 e / Å² resulting in a calculated cumulative dose of 170 e / Å² for the first 61 tilts per series . Data sets were acquired in separate acquisition sessions contributing 61 ( wildtype ) , 97 ( C5KO ) , and 61 ( C5LKO ) tilt - series , respectively . For data acquisition settings , see Figure S10B . Cryo - ET data processing Gain correction , frame alignment and defocus estimation of individual tilts were performed in Warp v1 . 0 . 9 ( 69 ) . Before exporting tilt - series as . mrc stacks , poor quality tilt - images caused , for example , by grid bars blocking the 15 beam at high tilt - angles , were removed . Tilt - series alignment was done using patch tracking within the IMOD software package v4 . 11 ( 70 ) . Alignment parameters as determined in IMOD were imported into Warp . The metrics necessary for dose - dependent low pass filtering were calculated during this step . Defocus parameters were then again determined for the whole tilt - series . 8× - binned ( 13 . 544 Å / px ) tomograms were exported for template matching in the Dynamo package v1 . 1 . 333 ( 71 ) . For template matching of branch junctions , a previously used template ( 13 ) was resampled to a pixel size of 13 . 544 Å / px using RELION v3 . 0 . 8 ( 72 , 73 ) . For actin filaments , a template was generated from a model of aged , nucleotide - bound , and phalloidin - stabilized F - actin ( pdb 6T20 from ( 74 ) ) employing the molmap function in chimera . The box of the resulting map was extended using RELION to be cube - shaped . For cross - correlation calculation during template matching , masks consisting of two cylinders ( 140 Å radius ) covering the branch or of one cylinder surrounding the single actin filament , respectively , were applied . Angular scanning around all three Euler angles was performed for a full 360° with a sampling step of 10° . False - positive cross - correlation peaks from predetermined areas containing gray value outliers were automatically removed . Subsequently , 400 positions from the branch junction search and up to 1000 positions from the actin filament search with the highest cross - correlation values per tomogram were selected for further processing . Particles from different data sets were processed independently . Dynamo2m scripts v0 . 2 . 2 ( 75 ) were employed to transform particle coordinates from Dynamo to RELION format . 24 , 400 wildtype / 38 , 800 C5KO / 24 , 400 C5LKO branch junction - containing particles ( 30 px side length , 13 . 544 Å / px ) and 61 , 061 wildtype / 87 , 300 C5KO / 54 , 900 C5LKO ) actin filament - containing particles ( 60 px side length , 6 . 722 Å / px ) were exported using Warp . 3D classification in RELION was used to remove junk particles reducing the number of branch junction - containing particles to 9 , 084 wildtype / 15 , 339 C5KO / 9 , 831 C5LKO and actin filament - containing particles to 59 , 472 wildtype / 85 , 966 C5KO / 54 , 332 C5LKO . Using Warp , all particles were then extracted into particles of 120 px side length with a pixel spacing of 3 . 386 Å . These datasets were then subjected to RELION 3D auto - refine using averages determined from the current particle orientations ( low - pass filtered to 40 Å ) as reference . Particles were automatically distributed into even and odd subsets during the RELION workflow . Subsequently , multi - particle refinement was performed in M v1 . 0 . 9 ( 76 ) , simultaneously considering F - actin and branch junctions particles . Tilt - series were refined using image warp with a 9 × 6 grid and volume warp with a 4 × 6 × 2 × 10 grid as well as tilt - angle optimization . Particle poses were refined for one temporal sampling point . Particles were re - extracted from the refined tilt - series at a pixel spacing of 1 . 693 Å and a side length of 200 px and were again aligned with RELION 3D auto - refine , using the result of the previous iteration filtered to 40 Å as reference . Multi - particle refinement was then again performed in M , simultaneously considering F - actin and branch junction particles . Tilt - series were refined using image warp with a 9 × 6 grid and volume warp with a 4 × 6 × 2 × 10 grid , as well as tilt - angle optimization and frame alignment . Particle poses were refined for one temporal sampling point . The filtered and sharpened maps of the branch junctions were considered the final structures for their respective data sets . Resolution at the 0 . 143 FSC criterion was calculated with RELION post - process employing the halfmaps from M as input . The masks employed for FSC measurements are shown in ( Figure S10 ) . The difference map was calculated using TEMPy : DiffMap ( 77 ) as implemented in the CCP - EM software suite v1 . 5 ( 78 , 79 ) , employing low - pass filtering of both maps to 8 . 1 Å , a fractional difference cut - off of 0 . 4 and dust filtering . Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed with Prism v9 . 0 . 2 ( GraphPad Software ) . Differences were assessed by a non - parametric two - tailed Student’s t - test ( two groups ) or a Kruskal - Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s multiple comparison test with the respective wildtype as reference ( more than two groups ) . We considered p - values smaller than 0 . 05 as significant . All cell biological experiments were repeated three times on independent samples . Quantifications from ultrastructural analysis stem from a single data acquisition per genotype . Sample numbers , medians , and p - values can be found in the figures and figure legends . ( Figure S14 ) contains descriptive statistics , normality tests , and test statistics for all quantifications . 16 Supplementary Figures B16 - F1 ArpC5 knock - out lines Reference : MmC5 WT ATGTCGAAGAACACGGTGTCGTCGGCCCGCTTCCGGAAGGTGGACGTGGACGAATATGACGAGAACAAGTTCGTGGACGAGGAGGACGGC… M S K N T V S S A R F R K V D V D E Y D E N K F V D E E D G … MmC5KO # 16 Allele 1 , T insertion , frame shift starting from residue 25 , STOP after residue 64 , 17 of 17 reads ATGTCGAAGAACACGGTGTCGTCGGCCCGCTTCCGGAAGGTGGACGTGGACGAATATGACGAGAACAAGTTTCGTGGACGAGGAGGACGGC… M S K N T V S S A R F R K V D V D E Y D E N K F R G R G G R … MmC5KO # 17 Allele 1 , T insertion , frame shift starting from residue 25 , STOP after residue 64 , 13 of 20 reads ATGTCGAAGAACACGGTGTCGTCGGCCCGCTTCCGGAAGGTGGACGTGGACGAATATGACGAGAACAAGTTTCGTGGACGAGGAGGACGGC… M S K N T V S S A R F R K V D V D E Y D E N K F R G R G G R … Allele 2 , T deletion , frame shift starting from residue 24 , STOP after residue 50 , 7 of 20 reads ATGTCGAAGAACACGGTGTCGTCGGCCCGCTTCCGGAAGGTGGACGTGGACGAATATGACGAGAACAAGTCGTGGACGAGGAGGACGGC… M S K N T V S S A R F R K V D V D E Y D E N K S W T R R T A … MmC5KO # 19 Allele 1 , T insertion , frame shift starting from residue 25 , STOP after residue 64 , 7 of 18 reads ATGTCGAAGAACACGGTGTCGTCGGCCCGCTTCCGGAAGGTGGACGTGGACGAATATGACGAGAACAAGTTTCGTGGACGAGGAGGACGGC… M S K N T V S S A R F R K V D V D E Y D E N K F R G R G G R … Allele 2 , T deletion , frame shift starting from residue 24 , STOP after residue 50 , 5 of 18 reads ATGTCGAAGAACACGGTGTCGTCGGCCCGCTTCCGGAAGGTGGACGTGGACGAATATGACGAGAACAAGTCGTGGACGAGGAGGACGGC… M S K N T V S S A R F R K V D V D E Y D E N K S W T R R T A … Allele 3 TC deletion , frame shift starting from residue 24 , STOP after residue 63 , 6 of 18 reads ATGTCGAAGAACACGGTGTCGTCGGCCCGCTTCCGGAAGGTGGACGTGGACGAATATGACGAGAACAAGTGTGGACGAGGAGGACGGC… M S K N T V S S A R F R K V D V D E Y D E N K C G R G G R R … B16 -
