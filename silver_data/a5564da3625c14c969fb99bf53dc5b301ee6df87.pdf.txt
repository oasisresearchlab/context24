Cognitive impairment may have varying degrees of influence on suicidal ideation ( SI ) and suicidal attempts ( SA ) . The aim of this study was to identify the cognitive biomarkers that distinguish suicidal ideation from suicidal attempts in adolescents . Methods : The cross - sectional sample comprised 54 adolescents with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and 32 healthy controls ( HC ) . The THINC - it was utilized to assess cognitive function of all the samples . Suicidal ideation was examined by the Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation Scale ( PANSI ) . Based on the type of data , one - way ANOVA or Kruskal – Wallis was performed to investigate group differences . Bonferroni post - hoc analysis was employed for regulating type I error for pairwise comparisons . Network analysis was used to compare the networks associated with suicidal ideation , depression symptoms , and cognitive function between SA and SI . Results : The depression symptoms ( HAMD - 17 ) ( F = 72 . 515 , P < 0 . 001 ) and suicidal ideation ( PANSI ) ( F = 267 . 952 , P < 0 . 001 ) in the SA were higher than those in the SI . Analysis of between - group differences showed SA performed worse in THINC - it , especially in “Spotter ( SP ) ” ( P = 0 . 033 ) , “Objective cognition score ( OS ) ” ( P = 0 . 027 ) and “Composite score ( CS ) ” ( P = 0 . 017 ) . Compared with SI , network analysis revealed that SA had a unique network of cognitive function , depressive symptoms , and suicidal ideation . Nevertheless , both networks exhibit comparable performance concerning the node strength of cognitive function . Within their separate networks , the aspects of CS , OS , and SP have emerged as the three most crucial elements . Conclusion : Adolescents with SI or SA exhibit a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments . Attention impairment can be beneficial in discerning between SI and SA . Future interventions for adolescent suicide can center on attention and the comprehensive cognitive ability that it represents . Keywords : attention impairment , suicide ideation , suicide attempts , adolescent , THINC - it tool , network analysis Introduction On a global scale , suicide represents a substantial public health concern . It is among the leading causes of mortality for adolescents between 15 and 19 . 1 – 3 In Europe , suicide is the second most prevalent cause of mortality among individuals aged 13 to 19 following vehicle accidents . 4 Each year , more than 10 , 000 young individuals in China commit suicide , which contributes to approximately 20 % of total mortality rates . 5 To date , the issue of youth suicide presents a significant Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2024 : 17 945 – 956 945 © 2024 Wang et al .

Consequently , there is an urgent need to enhance suicide prevention interventions specifically aimed at the adolescent population in China . With increasing research , suicide is no longer defined as a singular symptom but as a cluster of symptoms characterized as suicidal thinking and behaviors ( SITBs ) , which include SI , suicidal plans ( SP ) , suicidal threats ( ST ) , non - suicidal self - injury ( NSSI ) and SA . SI refers to the thought or contemplation of ending one’s own life ; SP means the intention to terminate one’s life via self - harm ; ST applies to a definition for conveying to the outside world that suicidal behavior may occur in the immediate future ; NSSI describes it as the intentional infliction of physical harm without the intent to kill , which is unacceptable in a social context . SA is the term for an act of self - harm or self - destruction intended to be fatal but not be realized . 6 – 9 Accumulating evidence suggests that SI and SA are considered separate factors that can independently predict suicide behavior . 10 – 12 Contrary to the conventional definition of suicide , the “ideation - to - action” framework theory contends that SI and SA have distinct etiological pathways . Furthermore , there is evidence of a reciprocal transition between symptoms . About one - third of SI will convert to SA . 13 Simultaneously , Baker’s investigation on adolescent suicide produced comparable findings . 14 In the sample of 4772 adolescents , the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts was 9 . 6 % and 6 . 8 % , respectively . A study by Nock et al 13 on 6483 teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 revealed that 12 . 1 % had SI and 4 . 1 % had SA in the past . Following a comprehensive survey conducted on a sample size of over 60 , 000 adolescents from China , the research findings indicated that the 12 - month prevalence rates for SI and SA were recorded at 13 % and 4 . 8 % , respectively . 15 However , some investigations into adolescent depression discovered that SI and SA exhibit a substantial relationship in stability and duration , providing additional evidence for a psychopathological continuum between these phenomena . 16 Given that SA is a strong predicator of suicidal behavior , it is crucial to search for biomarker that can differentiate between SA and SI status in adolescents . This will postpone the shift from SI to SA during the initial phase , thereby intervening in patients’ suicidal behavior at an early stage of the illness . Hence , we conducted a targeted assessment on depressed adolescents who exhibited SA and / or SI in order to find distinct biomarker that differentiate SI from SA . Furthermore , we compared these characteristics with those of mentally healthy adolescents . Notably , in the context of therapeutic practice , mental illnesses associated with depression frequently coexist with SI or SA , which can eventually lead to suicidal behaviors . According to existing research , depression has been identified as the most influential risk factor for SI and SA . However , it is unfortunate that most symptom descriptions in clinical case data are based on retrospective clinical interviews , which are obviously subjective . 17 – 20 Consequently , it is still challenging to distinguish the objective distinctions between the two components using psychological and behavioral representations . Thus , some readily implemented testing methods can help provide more and faster clinical information for future targeted interventions . The THINC - it was released at the 2016 annual meeting of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology ( ECNP ) ( website : https : / / thinc . progress . im / en ) . THINC - it has the advantages of simplicity , flexibility , and speed , as it can be administered at any time on a mobile device or computer and has been extensively used to assess cognitive function ( attention , executive function , working memory , etc . ) in depression . The complete testing method often spans around 10 to 15 minutes and can be promptly followed by feedback on the results . 21 , 22 Compared with routine cognitive function testing , there’s a legitimate reason to think it can successfully prevent the tiredness reaction . Simultaneously , the Chinese simplified version of THINC - it has been applied to the clinical research of adolescent depression and yielded similar results in specific terms of executive function and Integrated visual and aural continuous performance test ( IVA - CPT ) . 23 , 24 Research demonstrated that depression with SI and SA accompanied extensive cognitive impairment , particularly cognitive control impairment that was crucial in suicidal behavior . 25 According to the cognitive neural model of suicide , cognitive impairment reduces individuals’ capacity to coordinate attention and thought behavior . SA was distinguished from SI by overt symptoms , which might impede the individual’s ability to shift their attention away from negative emotional states such as despair and pain , resulting in a slower reaction time and relating to high levels of violence and fatal suicide behaviors . 26 – 30 Recent investigations indicated that individuals with SA exhibited more pronounced cognitive control impairments than those without this disposition . Consequently , it was plausible to hypothesize that SA exacerbates the extent of cognitive control impairments . 25 Similar results were found in a study involving adolescents with depression , in which attention responses were delayed in medication - naive patients compared to healthy controls . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 2147 / PRBM . S448904 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2024 : 17 946 Wang et al Dovepress Powered by TCPDF ( www . tcpdf . org ) The above results were more pronounced in those with suicidal tendencies . 31 It has been revealed that executive dysfunction is also positively correlated with the severity of suicide in the neurocognitive characteristics of individuals who commit suicide ; even though controlling for depressive symptoms , such a relationship still exists . 32 In the study of adolescent depression , which is characterized by attention impairment of executive functions , similar findings have been reported . 33 A review of 63 studies on SA reveals a high degree of result consistency . Working memory , executive function , attention , and cognitive control were all impaired ; however , results in the SI population were inconsistent . 34 The study of SA and SI in adults and adolescents is receiving growing attention . Due to the lack of consistent findings , it is plausible to consider that SI and SA may represent distinct clinical states despite sharing comparable clinical manifestations . 16 While a limited number of studies have yielded consistent findings in the adolescent population , 20 most research has focused on investigating specific dimensions of cognition , such as executive function and attention . The potential correlation could be attributed to the protracted and laborious procedures involved in conventional cognitive assessments , along with the limited capacity of adolescents to endure such processes . 22 Few studies have conducted comprehensive reviews of adolescents’ cognitive function in a brief time . To differentiate between SI and SA in adolescent depression , the study aimed to use THINC - it as a cognitive assessment tool to execute comprehensive cognitive function tests quickly . This assessment tool entails attention , working memory , and the subjective evaluation of cognitive ability , allowing for a more apparent distinction between SA and SI regarding symptom dimensions and cognitive performance . Conventional investigations on psychopathology mostly rely on scale scores to measure the intensity of symptoms and employ basic linear correlation to establish connections within the disorder . This might undermine significant associa - tions within or among mental disorders . 35 , 36 The study employed network analysis as a novel visual statistical technique to effectively illustrate the association between symptoms and symptoms / illnesses , hence facilitating the identification of intervention targets . 37 Given that SA and SI are different disease states , we hypothesized that adolescents with SA would have more severe attention impairment . In addition , the comprehensive manifestations of cognitive impairment can also help distinguish between SI and SA . Methods Participants This research is characterized as a cross - sectional observational study . It consisted of a sample of 86 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old . There was a total of 54 teenage depression patients , including both outpatients ( n = 14 ) and inpatients ( n = 40 ) ; 32 teenagers who participated as healthy controls were from the community . According to self - reported suicide status and Hamilton Depression Scale score - 17 ( HAMD - 17 ) , 38 the score for suicide ( ie , item - 3 on the HAMD - 17 scale ) in the two groups is greater than zero . Adolescents with depression were divided into ( a ) SI group ( n = 22 ) , there was suicide ideation in the last two weeks but no reported history of attempted suicide ; ( b ) SA group ( n = 32 ) , A lifetime history of suicidal ideation and self - reported suicide attempt . 39 The patients included in this study were diagnosed by experienced attending physicians and physicians holding the position of deputy director or above . These patients were picked based on meeting the predetermined selection criteria . The following are the inclusion and exclusion criteria . The following are the inclusion requirements for patients with SI and SA : 1 ) The patients were diagnosed with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) based on the diagnostic criteria outlined in the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision ( ICD - 10 ) ; 2 ) 12 to 18 years of age , Han Chinese ; 3 ) Patients with HAMD - 17 total score > 17 and item - 3 score > 0 ; 4 ) Parents or individuals are aware of the content of the study and provide informed consent in writing ; 5 ) Both inpatients and outpatients had examinations in the absence of medication . The exclusion criteria pertaining to patients with SI and SA are as follows : 1 ) Individuals presenting with comorbid mental or physical conditions that have the potential to impact cognitive function ; 2 ) Patients were diagnosed with mental retardation , substance dependence or abuse ( excluding nicotine and caffeine ) , bipolar disorder , obsessive - compulsive disorder , post - traumatic stress disorder , and eating disorders ; 3 ) Taking any medication that may influence cognitive function ( such as glucocorticoids , β - receptor blockers , opioid analgesics , and central stimulants ) ; 4 ) Patients who had consumed benzodiazepines within 12 hours prior to the THINC - it test ; 5 ) Antipsychotic medication has been Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2024 : 17 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 2147 / PRBM . S448904 DovePress 947 Dovepress Wang et al Powered by TCPDF ( www . tcpdf . org ) utilized for the past three months ; 6 ) Patients who had ingested alcohol within eight hours prior to the THINC - it clinical trial ; 7 ) Patients who received electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) in the previous six months ; 8 ) Patients identified as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) ; Or 9 ) Patients incapable of reading or comprehending the informed consent form . Inclusion criteria for HC : 1 ) No mental disorder and no history of mental disorder in the family ; 2 ) 12 to 18 years of age , Han Chinese ; 3 ) Junior high school or higher level of education ; 4 ) HAMD - 17 total score≤7 , item - 3 score = 0 ; 5 ) Parents or individuals were aware of the content of the investigation and provided written consent . Procedure The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hebei Mental Health Center . It was compliant with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association ( Declaration of Helsinki ) . Informed written consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians after a complete and extensive description . Instruments Assess Depressive Symptoms ( HAMD - 17 ) The HAMD - 17 38 is a validated measurement tool consisting of 17 items that are utilized to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals during clinical interviews . This scale employs a 5 - point scale ranging from 0 to 4 , and as the total score increases , it indicates that the patient’s depressive symptoms are becoming increasingly severe . The severe depression total score is≥24 ; The mild or moderate depression total score is≥17 ; the No depression symptoms total score is≤7 . There is good consistency in Chinese research ( α = 0 . 714 ) . 40 Assess Suicidal Ideation ( PANSI ) PANSI 41 is a 14 - item self - evaluation scale for evaluating suicidal ideation . It includes two dimensions : positive suicidal ideation ( 6 items ) and negative suicidal ideation ( 8 items ) . This measure , which uses the Likert 5 - level scoring technique , rates the frequency of suicidal ideation from “never” to “always” on a range of 1 to 5 . The scoring methodology is the summation of two aspects of scores related to suicide ideation . Higher scores indicate more significant suicidal ideation . It is crucial to recognize that the assessment of positive suicidal thoughts utilizes the reverse scoring system . The Chinese version of PANSI , including negative suicidal ideation ( α = 0 . 94 ) and positive suicidal ideation ( α = 0 . 86 ) , has excellent internal consistency in studies of adolescents in China . 42 Evaluate Cognitive Function ( The Simplified Chinese Version of THINC - It ) The digital cognitive evaluation instrument comprises five sub - tests : The Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression , 5 - item ( PDQ - 5 - D ) is a self - report instrument designed to evaluate the cognitive components of an indivi - dual’s subjective experience of depression ; There are four cognitive tests that serve as objective measures : 1 ) Spotter ( SP ) : The Choice Reaction Time ( CRT ) paradigm and the Identification Task ( IDN ) are used to measure the mean latency for correct responses , expressed in milliseconds , and can evaluate the subjects’ attention reflexes and flexibility ; 2 ) Symbol Check ( SC ) : The One - Back Test measures the number of correct responses , and subjects’ working memory , executive function , and attention can be evaluated using the item ; 3 ) Codebreaker ( CB ) : The Digit Symbol Substitution Test ( DSST ) is employed to assess participants’ capacity for observation , reaction , and execution by quantifying the number of accurate responses ; 4 ) Trails ( TRA ) : The Trail Making Test Part B is a cognitive assessment tool that utilized the duration of completion as a metric to evaluate executive function . 21 , 24 The objective score ( OS ) calculation involved summing the Z - scores for each objective test measure , with equal weights assigned to each measure for every participant ; the composite score ( CS ) calculation involved summing the OS and the PDQ - 5 - D score . 43 Recent studies in China have demonstrated that the PDQ - 5 - D in depressed populations has a Cronbach’s alpha of = 0 . 704 % and that all four sub - tests have excellent simultaneous validity ( r range from 0 . 343 to 0 . 835 , all P < 0 . 01 ) . 44 Demographic Data We used a self - administered general information questionnaire , and the following variables were collected : Age , BMI , Years of education , Gender , Disease course , Type of depressive episode , and Family history . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 2147 / PRBM . S448904 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2024 : 17 948 Wang et al Dovepress Powered by TCPDF ( www . tcpdf . org ) Cognition Research Process The sequence of cognitive function assessment was : PDQ - 5 - D→ Spotter→ Symbol Check→ Code Breaker→ Trails , and on the first day of admission , each group was assessed in the same order . 44 The classification of subjects was unknown to both the assessor and the subjects . The specific experimental steps are detailed in the English version of the THINC - it study conducted by McIntyre et al . 22 Sample Size Calculation Regarding sample size , we used the G * Power ( 3 . 1 ) 45 software to analyze the required sample size , which was presented at the effect level f = 0 . 4 , 46 significance level α = 0 . 05 ( bilateral ) , statistical test capability 1 - β = 0 . 8 , and the total sample size was 66 . It can be considered that our sample size is sufficient under the above requirements . Statistical Analysis We followed the method that McIntyre et al 22 described for calculating cognitive function scores from raw scores to Z - scores in detail . This study was analyzed with SPSS 26 . 0 . The Kolmogorov – Smirnov test was employed to assess the conformity of the measurement data to a normal distribution . Continuous variables were utilized as means ( standard deviations ) , and categorical variables were used as frequencies ( percentages ) in descriptive analysis . The median ( upper - lower quartile ) was applied to non - normal metrics . In the research , the chi - square test was utilized for the study of count data . In contrast , the one - way ANOVA was utilized to analyze the difference among groups of normality data . The Kruskal – Wallis test was applied to compare the non - normal data among groups . To reduce the likelihood of Type I errors that may arise from doing multiple tests , Bonferroni post - hoc analyses were employed to compare variables in a two - way method . A p - value less than 0 . 05 in a two - tailed test was deemed statistically significant . The study utilized the R package qgraph 47 and applied a Gaussian graphical model ( GGM ) 48 to compare networks related to cognitive function , depressive symptoms , and suicide in patients with SI and SA . In the GGM , the edges describe conditional dependence relationships between components . In the resultant graph , even though all other variables are controlled , a connection between two items also indicates their dependence . Conversely , the two items are considered conditionally independent if there is no connection . GGM is commonly performed using the graphical lasso method , which has the advantage of employing regularization to minimize the estimation of spurious edges . 49 Consequently , this approach can effectively balance network sparsity and the goodness - of - fit . The method seeks to maximize the penalized log - likelihood by combining a log - likelihood function with a penalty term dependent on the network density . The tuning parameter ( λ1 ) corresponds to the sparse and dense features of the network . The extended Bayesian information criterion ( EBIC ) can be utilized as a method for calculating an optimal score of λ1 to obtain a network estimate that closely approximates the most realistic outcome . 50 The graph lasso method was ultimately employed to optimize the estimation of the network and provide sparse and succinct networks that effectively describe the data . The network estimation graphic can illustrate the strength of correlations between variables . Thicker edges represent stronger correlations , whereas red dashed lines indicate negative correlations , and solid blue lines indicate positive correlations . Various colored nodes correspond to different psychology measurement dimensions . To provide a quantitative assessment of the significance of network structure , three indices of node centrality , notably strength , closeness , and betweenness , were calculated . 51 Strength refers to the cumulative weight of all edges directly related to the nodes . If the node has more robust direct connections to other nodes , it will have greater strength . Closeness corresponds to a given node to all the other connected ones , equal to the inverse weight sum of the shortest path . If a node exhibits more closeness , it will have a more rapid impact on other nodes . Betweenness is a measure of a node’s connective value in the network and is defined as the frequency with which a node links to two other nodes on the shortest path possible . 52 According to research findings , closeness and betweenness cannot be reliably estimated , so we only considered node strength when comparing centrality differences . In addition , the research also included expected influence ( EI ) , one of the most reliable centrality measures , which was utilized to get the total of the absolute values of each node’s connection weights . 53 Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2024 : 17 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 2147 / PRBM . S448904 DovePress 949 Dovepress Wang et al Powered by TCPDF ( www . tcpdf . org ) Results The sociodemographic , clinical , and laboratory characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The depression symptoms ( HAMD - 17 ) ( F = 72 . 515 , P < 0 . 001 ) and suicidal ideation ( PANSI ) ( F = 267 . 952 , P < 0 . 001 ) in the SA were higher than those in the SI . Moreover , no statistically significant differences were observed in terms of Age , Gender , BMI , Years of education , Disease course , Type of depressive episode , and Family history between the SA and SI . The analysis of intergroup differences in THINC - it cognitive scores was illustrated in Table 2 and Figure 1 . Based on the available data , the one - way ANOVA analysis of variance was used to compare the cognitive differences in SP , CB , PDQ - 5 - D , OS , and CS among the three groups . The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference among the three groups in SP ; Subsequent Bonferroni post hoc analysis indicated that the SA group had a significantly lower value than the SI group ( P = 0 . 033 ) . On the PDQ - 5 - D , there were statistically significant differences between groups ; Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed SA < HC ( P = 0 . 001 ) and SI < HC ( P = 0 . 001 ) , but no statistical difference between SA and SI . Differences in OS were statistically significant among groups ; Bonferroni post hoc tests revealed SA < SI ( P = 0 . 027 ) . CS demonstrated statistically significant differences among groups . Further post - hoc analyses using the Bonferroni method revealed that SA significantly differed from both SI ( P = 0 . 017 ) and HC ( P = 0 . 001 ) ; However , there was no statistically significant difference between SI and HC . The Kruskal – Wallis test examined the cognitive disparities among the three groups in the SC and TRA contexts . Nevertheless , no significant statistical distinction was observed among the various groups . Regarding model estimation , network analysis revealed that the SA had a unique network of cognitive function , depressive symptoms , and suicide compared to the SI ( Figure 2 ) . Meanwhile , the network of SI was sparser than that of Table 1 General Demographic Information HC ( A ) SA ( B ) SI ( C ) F / χ 2 / t P Contrast ( n = 32 ) ( n = 32 ) ( n = 22 ) Age ( years ) 14 . 00 ( 13 . 00 ~ 16 . 00 ) 14 . 00 ( 13 . 00 ~ 15 . 00 ) 15 . 00 ( 14 . 00 ~ 17 . 00 ) 2 . 585 0 . 081 – BMI 19 . 98 ( 16 . 81 ~ 22 . 19 ) 20 . 84 ( 17 . 67 ~ 22 . 99 ) 20 . 73 ( 18 . 27 ~ 22 . 67 ) 1 . 238 0 . 538 – Years of education 8 . 00 ( 7 . 00 ~ 10 . 75 ) 8 . 00 ( 7 . 00 ~ 10 . 00 ) 10 . 00 ( 8 . 00 ~ 11 . 00 ) 2 . 126 0 . 126 – HAMD - 17 total score 3 . 16±1 . 08 26 . 00 ( 24 . 00 ~ 28 . 50 ) 19 . 00 ( 17 . 75 ~ 21 . 00 ) 72 . 515 < 0 . 001 A < C < B Gender ( male / female ) 14 / 18 9 / 23 10 / 12 2 . 279 0 . 320 – Course of disease ( months ) NA 6 . 00 ( 3 . 25 ~ 12 . 00 ) 5 . 00 ( 1 . 00 ~ 12 . 00 ) − 1 . 156 0 . 248 – PANSI total score 3 . 31±1 . 26 52 . 03±11 . 70 35 . 27±9 . 10 267 . 952 < 0 . 001 A < C < B Type of depressive episode ( First / Recurrent ) NA 10 / 22 10 / 12 1 . 128 0 . 391 – Family history ( negative / positive ) NA 24 / 8 18 / 4 0 . 351 0 . 742 – Abbreviations : HC , healthy controls ; SI , suicidal ideation ; SA , suicide attempts ; BMI , Body Mass Index ; HAMD - 17 , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 - item ; PANSI , Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation scale .

The study showed a direct and negative correlation between suicidal ideation ( ie , PS : PANSI Score ) and objective cognitive function ( ie , OS : Objective Score ) in the SA group . However , in the SI group , suicidal ideation did not exhibit any directly or indirectly associated characteristics . Despite this , it is worth noting that both groups had similar results regarding the centrality index of cognitive performance . In the centrality difference of strength , CS , OS , and SP were key central symptoms in their respective networks . The results are presented in Figure 3 .

S448904 DovePress 951 Dovepress Wang et al Powered by TCPDF ( www . tcpdf . org ) Discussion It is essential to clarify the relationship between SA and SI to comprehend and prevent suicide among depressed adolescents . The present study illustrated the difference between SA and SI by describing the changes in cognitive function among depressed adolescents with different suicide dimensions and giving a more positive interpretation with healthy adolescents as the control group . The findings revealed that adolescents with SA had more severe attention impairment and depressive symptoms than those with SI . Furthermore , it could be observed that SA exhibited a more compact network structure in relation to cognitive function , depression , and suicide . Existing research indicates a link between frequent attention impairment and fatal SA . 31 In this study , the analysis of cognitive function differences revealed that SA was associated with a more severe attention impairment , particularly concerning attention flexibility and reaction time . Based on the scoring principle of THINC - it , it is posited that the disparity between the CS and the OS primarily arises from the SP component . The observed distinction between groups attributed to the SP factor remained statistically significant even after including other items that exhibited no discernible variation between the groups . The study on adolescent depression yielded comparable findings , indicating that SA had a greater propensity for delayed attention responses on the Attention Network Task ( ANT ) test . 31 In addition , the Continuous Performance Test , Identical Pairs ( CPT ) instrument used to evaluate depression in adolescents’ attention also Figure 3 Comparison of the centrality difference of strength and expected influence ( EI ) in the networks across two samples .

The absence of this capacity significantly contributes to the occurrence of suicide . 26 Recent results indicate a correlation between cognitive control impairment and impaired cognitive regulation in adolescents . This correlation suggests that individuals may have challenges while attempting to assess the potential costs and rewards associated with conflict events . This behavior can exacerbate challenges in maintaining positive social relationships , impede the ability to redirect focus away from negative emotions such as despair and suffering and contribute to a more entrenched inclination to avoid and resolve difficulties by choosing suicide as a solution . In addition , the presence of persistent negative thoughts and feelings can often trigger contemplation of suicide , therefore suggesting that cognitive control dysfunction may serve as a significant risk factor for suicidal tendencies . 13 , 29 , 57 , 58 The brain regions implicated in cognitive control and attention impairments exhibit strong connections with the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) and consistently demonstrate links to depression and cognitive impairment . 59 , 60 SI and SA figures indicate that the risk of depression is approximately six times higher than in healthy people . 61 Furthermore , Chinese teenagers who experienced SA were significantly more prone to developing depression ( adjusted odds ratio for depression : 3 . 63 ; P < 0 . 05 ) . 14 In accordance with our findings , SA is frequently associated with more severe depression . This phenomenon can be linked to the theoretical framework highlighting “suicide capability” . The framework posits that the transition from ideation to actual behavior is influenced by increasing negative emotional experiences and tolerance for the misery connected with death . 12 For the first time , network analysis is a potent empirical method for visualizing interactions among depressive symptoms , cognitive function , and suicidal ideation in SA and SI . Firstly , while comparing SI with SA , it could be observed that SA possesses a distinct and highly interconnected network structure . A possible explanation was that SA has a broader cognitive and depressive symptom distress profile , so external performance for closer relationships in the network . 25 Secondly , compared with SA , the network of SI associated with depression and suicidal ideation does not appear to be robust , and this further explains the different causes of SI and SA , as well as their belonging to distinct disease states . 16 Meanwhile , the prior study confirmed that individuals with SA demonstrated heightened levels of depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment . These findings may also be utilized to verify the accuracy of the network model’s estimations . 25 , 32 , 34 However , it is essential to note that attention and comprehensive cognitive ability , considered critical nodes in network analysis , may significantly trigger activation and lead to various suicidal behaviors . Thus , targeting these key nodes can potentially provide widespread symptomatic improvements . 62 To sum up , it may be advantageous to incorporate attention as the focal point of cognitive rehabilitation exercises to enhance the pathological condition , attain the objective of addressing depression , and mitigate suicide among teenagers . The findings of the study are subject to some limitations . This study is classified as a cross - sectional study , and it should be noted that the sample size is relatively small . The lack of longitudinal data has problems establishing causation and generalizing the findings to the adolescent population . Nevertheless , given the importance of this research for the targeted demographic , it remains justifiable to extend its applicability to a broader group in further studies . Furthermore , the present study operationalized SA as a state that manifests across an individual’s entire lifespan without imposing any precise temporal constraints . This limitation can potentially impact the association between SA and suicide . Subsequent investigations may benefit from more precisely delineating the timing of SA occurrences to investigate potential variations in temporal effects . As there is increasing evidence that substance abuse and adolescent suicide share risk factors , 63 such as impulse control , pressure events , mood disorders , etc . , future research can incorporate the above evidence to investigate adolescent suicide risk and protection mechanisms . In general , adolescents who have SA and SI exhibit significant cognitive dysfunction as compared to their healthy counterparts . However , it seems that adolescents with SA exhibit more pronounced symptoms of depression and cognitive dysfunction . Impaired attention can serve as biological marker to differentiate between SA and SI in teenagers within the realm of cognitive function . Early intervention in adolescent attention has the potential to improve future adolescent suicidal behavior .
