Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA Vol . 88 , pp . 7333 - 7337 , August 1991 Cell Biology Import of simian virus 40 virions through nuclear pore complexes ( DNA tumor virus / nuclear transport ) JARED CLEVER , MASAYASU YAMADA , AND HARUMI KASAMATSU * Department of Biology and the Molecular Biology Institute , University of California , Los Angeles , 405 Hilgard Avenue , Los Angeles , CA 90024 - 1606 Communicated by Peter K . Vogt , April 22 , 1991 ABSTRACT How the DNA tumor virus , simian virus 40 , reaches the nucleus is unknown . In this report we have tested the affinity of simian virus 40 toward the nucleus by microin - jecting virion particles into the cytoplasm under conditions in which cell - surface - mediated viral infection was blocked . Sub - cellular localization of viral structural proteins Vpl , Vp2 , and Vp3 , large tumor antigen , and virion particles was followed immunocytochemically and ultrastructurally . Both virion par - ticles and viral structural proteins localized in the nucleus within 1 - 2 hr after cytoplasmic injection and subsequently expressed large tumor antigen , which was detected in the nucleus as early as 3 hr after cytoplasmic injection . Vpl and large tumor antigen nuclear accumulation , as well as virion nuclear entry , were blocked by wheat germ agglutinin and an anti - nucleoporin monoclonal antibody , mAb 414 . Virion par - ticles were visualized in the vicinity of nuclear pores and in the cytoplasm with this agent . We conclude that virion particles are karyophilic and enter through nuclear pores . This study sug - gests that vrion structural proteins facilitate virion import into the nucleus and viral gene expression . An explanation of how infectious animal viruses reach their virion reproductive site upon cell entry is central to the understanding of virion morphogenesis and the prevention of infectious disease . Papovaviruses adsorb to the cell surface via receptors , where they are internalized in endocytic ves - icles ; these virion - containing vesicles are reported to be transported across the cytoplasm to the nucleus , the repro - ductive site of the virion ( 1 - 9 ) . The surface of the nonenvel - oped virus is assumed to contain information necessary for targeting the infectious particles to the reproductive site . During normal cell - surface - mediated viral infection , some intracellular virion particles have been found in association with the nuclear fraction as early as 15 min - 2 hr of infection , and dissociation of virions into viral structural proteins Vpl , Vp2 , and Vp3 and viral DNA occurs there 4 - 6 hr after infection ( 2 - 4 ) . This result indicates that a fraction of the infectious particles reaches the nucleus shortly after infec - tion , and uncoating follows thereafter . This relatively short nuclear transit and disassembly time contrasts with the long time seen for commencement of viral gene expression and that seen for intracytoplasmic trafficking of the particles . ( i ) A long latent period occurs before onset of viral gene expression after viral infection ( 1 , 10 ) . ( it ) Most virion par - ticles have been found in many cytoplasmic compartments , including endoplasmic reticulum , lysosomes , and mitochon - dria for long periods after infection , whereas only a few particles have been seen in the nucleus , both in the nucleo - plasm and the intracisternal space of the nuclear envelope ( 2 - 4 , 5 - 7 ) . In fact , the latter observation has led to a proposal that the infectious virions enter the nucleus through fusion of the outer nuclear membrane with endocytotic vacuoles con - taining virion particles ( 2 - 4 , 7 ) . These observations , how - ever , did not show whether cytologically visualized virion particles are those capable of gene expression and propaga - tion of the infectious cycle . Reproduction of simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) , a member of the papovavirus family , occurs in the nucleus of African green monkey kidney cells ( 1 ) . We have mapped the nuclear transport signal ( NTS ) of Vp2 / 3 to residues 316 - 324 of Vp2 and 198 - 206 of Vp3 , GPNKKKRKL ( in one - letter code ) ( 11 ) , which is within a Vp2 / 3 nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) ( 12 ) . The distinction between an NTS and an NLS is as follows : an NTS can target nonnuclear proteins to the nu - cleus , whereas an NLS can localize the signal - harboring proteins to the nucleus by undefined means without any NTS activity . The amino - terminal 8 residues of SV40 Vpl contain an NLS ( 13 ) but do not promote entry of nonnuclear proteins into the nucleus ( 14 ) and , hence , appear insufficient as an NTS . These signals presumably target recently synthesized viral proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus for virion assembly . Because a virion particle is composed of these three structural proteins , these signals may also be involved in initially routing infectious virion particles to the reproduc - tive site . In this study we have used microinjection to introduce virion particles directly into the cell cytoplasm to test whether virions , infectious particles , are effectively targeted to the nucleus , and if so , whether they can initiate viral gene expression . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines , conditions for cell culture , and preparation of rabbit anti - Vpl and anti - Vp3 sera have been described ( 15 ) , as have the procedures for immunofluorescence microscopy and for the use of wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) and Con A ( 11 ) . Guinea pig anti - Vpl was prepared as described ( 15 ) . SV40 was purified from infected cell lysates as described ( 16 ) . The purified virus was centrifuged to equilibrium in CsCl / TD buffer ( 0 . 14 M NaCl / 5 mM KCl / 0 . 7 mM Na2HPO4 / 2 . 5 mM Tris HCl , pH 7 . 5 ) , and the virus band at 1 . 34 g / cc was collected and stored in the CsCl / TD buffer at - 20 ' C . Con - centration ofvirus was extrapolated from virion protein mass visualized by Coomassie blue staining after NaDodSO4 / PAGE of virion samples compared with known amounts of protein marker ( s ) , as well as from spectrophotometric mea - surements ofthe sample at 260 and 280 nm ( 17 ) . Purified virus preparations contained 1 x 1012 and 1 x 1014 physical particles per ml ( corresponding to 1 x 1010 and 1 x 1012 plaque - forming units per ml , assuming 100 physical particles comprise 1 plaque - forming unit ) . The number of virion par - ticles cytoplasmically microinjected was , unless otherwise noted , from 5 x 102 to 5 x 103 particles for the immunoflu - orescent studies and from 1 x 104 to 5 x 104 particles for EM studies . Purified monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) 414 ( 18 ) was Abbreviations : NLS , nuclear localization signal ; NTS , nuclear trans - port signal ; CGP - BSA , colloidal gold particle - bovine serum albu - min ; WGA , wheat germ agglutinin ; mAb , monoclonal antibody ; hpmj , hours post - microinjection ; hpmf , hours post - microinfection . * To whom reprint requests should be addressed . 7333 The publication costs ofthis article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) obtained from David Goldfarb ( University of Rochester , Rochester , NY ) and was coinjected with virus at 12 . 5 mg / ml , as was an anti - Escherichia coli B - galactosidase mAb , anti - , B - gal ( Promega ) . Microinjection of cells was done as described ( 11 ) . The microinjection experiments were done , except for those used for EM , with 0 . 04 ml of virus neutralizing antibody ( calf anti - SV40 , Flow Laboratories ) per ml of the medium . For EM thin sectioning , 5 - nm colloidal gold particles ( CGP ) coupled to bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( 1 x 1014 particles per ml , Ted Pella , Redding , CA ) were included in the microinjection sample . Microinjected cells were marked as an islet by scraping off adjacent and surrounding nonmicro - injected cells with a glass capillary before incubation . A microinfection procedure was developed in which the capil - laries were brought close to , but did not touch , the cell surface . The microinfection was done either with or without neutralizing anti - SV40 antibody and cells were cultured in the absence or presence of the antibody , respectively . For EM , microinjected cell islets were fixed , ethanol - dehydrated , and processed for EM thin section as described ( 19 ) . Sections were viewed on a Philips 420 electron micro - scope at 120 KeV . For visualization of virion particles or 5 - nm CGP - BSA , droplets containing samples were applied to the parlodion - coated grids , rinsed with water , ethanol - dehydrated , and viewed by EM with or without uranyl acetate treatment , respectively . RESULTS Blockade of Cell - Surface - Mediated Viral Infection . Micro - injection experiments were done under constant air pressure in which infectious particles continuously leak out from a glass capillary tip . It was , therefore , imperative to first demonstrate that cell - surface - mediated viral infection was effectively blocked and that the biological activities pre - sented here originated solely from the cytoplasmically mi - croinjected particles . We established a microinfection pro - cedure in which the capillary was brought to the surface of a permissive host ( TC7 ) cell without penetrating the cytoplas - mic membrane , and infectious particles were delivered to the A Q a _ . , , ' . , P . h . . : , , ' e cell surface . Cells growing along a diamond knife - etched line on glass coverslips were infected with virion particles in medium either containing virion neutralizing antiserum ( Fig . 1 A - C ) or lacking the antiserum ( Fig . 1 D - F ) . Virion particles could infect cells , and both an early gene product , large tumor antigen ( Fig . 1E ) , and a late gene product , Vpl ( Fig . 1F ) , were found in the proper cell compartments without antise - rum . In contrast , with the neutralizing reagent , cell - surface - mediated viral infection was effectively blocked for as long as 24 hr after microinfection , as judged by lack of both gene products ( Fig . 1 B and C ) . Consequently , the cytoplasmic microinjection experiments presented here were done , ex - cept for the EM study , in the presence of the neutralizing antiserum to block cell - surface - mediated infection . SV40 Particles Are Karyophilic . When virion particles ( Fig . 2A shows the composition of their structural proteins ) were directly introduced into the cytoplasm of TC7 cells together with nonnuclear rhodamine - labeled BSA ( 11 ) , the major coat protein Vpl accumulated in the nucleus within 2 hr of microinjection [ hours post - microinjection ( hpmj ) ] ( Fig . 2B ) , whereas the rhodamine - BSA remained in the cytoplasm of the same cells ( Fig . 2C ) . Nuclear Vpl accumulation was seen as early as 1 hpmj and appeared complete by 2 hpmj ( Fig . 3 A , C , E , and G ) . At 0 hpmj , virion - associated Vpl could be seen entirely in the cytoplasm of microinjected cells ( data not shown ) . The accumulation could be visualized for up to 6 hpmj and then became undetectable by 6 - 12 hpmj ( J . C . , unpublished results ) . Nuclear Vpl accumulation could result from dissociation of the virion particles in the cytoplasm and then entry of the structural proteins . Alternatively , the accumulation could reflect the nuclear entry of intact virion particles . We at - tempted to distinguish between these alternatives by asking whether minor structural proteins Vp2 / 3 accompany Vpl nuclear accumulation or whether virion particles can be visualized in the nucleus . Presumably because of low molar content of Vp2 / 3 relative to that of Vpl in virion particles , Vp2 / 3 was not detected in cells injected with 5 x 102 to 5 x 103 particles ( data not shown ) .

These electron - dense particles were not present in nonin - jected cells ( data not shown ) . Such experiments show that SV40 particles are karyophilic and enter the nucleus shortly after their introduction into the cytoplasm by microinjection . Virion Nuclear Entry Is Blocked by WGA and mAb 414 . Both WGA and mAb 414 bind to the nucleoporin p62 ( 18 ) at the central transporter apparatus of the nuclear pore complex ( 21 ) and block entry of signal - mediated nuclear proteins ( 22 - 24 ) . Con A , on the other hand , binds to gp210 , which spans the lumen of the nuclear envelope ( 25 - 28 ) and does not inhibit transport ( 22 , 23 ) . We tested the effect of these reagents on nuclear Vpl accumulation by cytoplasmic comi - croinjection of virion particles with each reagent or a control antibody against p - galactosidase . Nuclear Vpl was seen in cells coinjected with either Con A ( Fig . 5E ) or control antibody ( Fig .

In contrast , in WGA - or mAb 414 - coinjected cells , Vpl staining in the nucleus was virtually eliminated and was , instead , seen in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 5 C and G ) . Nuclear accumulation of Vp2 / 3 was also blocked in cells coinjected with mAb 414 , as was Vpl ( data not shown ) . In agreement with the Vpl immunostaining results , EM confirmed that electron - dense particles were predominantly found in the cytoplasm of mAb 414 - coinjected cells ( 2 . 6 ± 2 . 4 particles per Am2 , Fig . 4C ) . Some electron - dense particles ( 0 . 3 ± 0 . 4 particles per gm2 ) were also found in transit at the pore ( Fig . 4C , arrow , and F ) or just inside the inner nuclear membrane ( data not shown ) . Large Tumor Antigen Expression Accompanies Virion Nu - clear Entry . If the virion particles that are artificially intro - duced into the cytoplasm and that subsequently enter the nucleus are competent for expression of their own genes , production of an early gene product , large tumor antigen , should accompany the nuclear accumulation of Vpl or the particles . This hypothesis was tested by indirect , double - immunofluorescent microscopy with anti - Vpl and anti - large tumor antigen serum after cytoplasmic virion microinjection . Nuclear large tumor antigen staining was not seen by 2 hpmj ( Fig . 3 B and D ) but did appear at 3 and 4 hpmj ( Fig . 3 F and H ) . Thus , the viral genomes were present in the nucleus and were transcribed . The large tumor antigen , which is not a virion structural component , was synthesized and localized to the nucleus within 1 - 2 hr of the virion nuclear entry . Virion - associated Vpl nuclear accumulation preceded viral gene - encoded large tumor antigen accumulation by 2 hr ( Fig . 3 A - H ) . Furthermore , after cytoplasmic microinjection , large tumor antigen was detected in the nucleus only when Vpl was found there ; both WGA and mAb 414 , which prevented virion nuclear entry , also prevented large tumor antigen expression ( Fig . 5 D and H ) , whereas Con A and anti - 13 - galactosidase , which did not prevent virion nuclear accumu - lation , allowed large tumor antigen expression ( Fig . 5 F and J ) to the same degree as virions alone ( Fig . SB ) . Thus , cytoplasmically injected virion particles are competent for both nuclear import and viral gene expression . DISCUSSION We have established a microinfection assay system in which cell - surface - mediated SV40 infection was efficient but was completely blocked by virus - neutralizing antibody . To assess virion nuclear entry , we then microinjected virion particles directly into the cytoplasm of permissive host cells in the presence of the neutralizing antibody . A significant number of SV40 particles introduced directly into the cytoplasm are karyophilic , enter the nucleus through nuclear pores , and can express an early gene , large tumor antigen , which accumu - lates in the nucleus of the microinjected cells . In normal papovavirus infections , virion particles enter the cytoplasm of permissive host cells through the cell surface before they reach the nucleus . The fate of virion particles after infection , as well as the time course of appearance of nuclear large tumor antigen , have been well - documented ( 1 - 7 , 10 , 29 , 30 ) . Despite the fact that the estimated number of virion particles injected into the cytoplasm of a cell in our study is equivalent to that used in reported infection studies , this injection study differs from the reported infection studies ( 2 - 7 , 10 , 29 ) in two major ways : ( i ) the shortened time course for nuclear large tumor antigen accumulation and ( it ) the site of virion nuclear entry . In our cytoplasmic virion microin - jection study , nuclear accumulation of all viral structural proteins took 1 - 2 hr ; most electron - dense virion particles were visualized there at 1 . 5 hpmj , and large tumor antigen accumulation in the nucleus took only 3 - 4 hr . Because 1 - 2 hr are required for virions to enter the nucleus , we estimate that - 2 hr are necessary for the onset of large tumor antigen gene expression , synthesis , and targeting of the gene product , whereas in viral infection with a multiplicity of infection of - 5 - 10 plaque - forming units , nuclear accumulation of large tumor antigen has been noted to occur at 10 - 12 hr after infection ( 10 , 29 ) . A similar time course for nuclear large tumor antigen accumulation has been seen in our cell - surface - mediated microinfection assay system ( J . C . , unpublished observation ) . Thus , introduction of the particles directly into the cytoplasm substantially shortens the duration required for the onset of large tumor antigen expression by - 7 - 8 hr . A simple explanation for this difference is difficult . Because the major difference is site of virion delivery , the processes of endocytosis and intracytoplasmic transit could be ineffi - cient or virion particles could be damaged during intracyto - plasmic trafficking , resulting in only a small fraction of infectious virion particles reaching the nucleus . Thus , am - plification of the viral genome must occur before enough large tumor antigen gene products accumulate for detection . These observations offer experimental evidence for virion nuclear entry through nuclear pores and contrast with a nuclear - entry route proposed in normal infection ; the latter entry assumes that virions enter the nucleus via a fusion event between the outer nuclear membrane and virion - containing endocytic vesicles that have been transported Proc . NatL Acad . Sci . USA 88 ( 1991 ) 7337 across the cytoplasm after cell - surface - mediated infection ( 2 - 4 , 7 ) . So far we have not found virion particles in the intracisternal space of the nuclear envelope , even though reasonable particle numbers are found in the nucleus . If most virion particles are karyophilic , as suggested here , why have particles been found in a number of cytoplasmic compart - ments as well as in the intracisternal space of the nuclear envelope ( 2 - 4 , 7 ) ? One possibility is that the particles may be incorporated into these subcellular compartments but cannot lead to viral gene expression . Indeed , this question has not been addressed . The possibility that an injury by microin - jection circumvented normal intracytoplasmic trafficking routes and promoted virion nuclear entry is unlikely because large tumor antigen expression can be prevented by micro - injecting mAb 414 cytoplasmically into SV40 - microinfected cells ( M . Y . , unpublished work ) , indicating the importance of nuclear pores for virus infection . The use of nuclear pores for virion nuclear entry is sup - ported by the blockade of nuclear Vpl accumulation by nucleoporin - binding reagents , as well as the blockade of virion particles from the nucleus . These reagents also blocked subsequent large tumor antigen gene expression . The absence of the template viral DNA for transcription as a consequence of the blockade of virion nuclear entry is a reasonable cause for the lack of large tumor antigen gene expression after comicroinjection of virion / mAb 414 or vir - ion / WGA . However , we realize that the reagents could block nuclear entry of auxiliary components required for gene expression . Although our results clearly demonstrate entry of infec - tious virion material through the nuclear pore , this observa - tion does not elucidate any mechanism of transit through the nuclear pore . It is possible that the virion particle changes its shape as it goes through a fully extended and open pore or a partial uncoating of the virus occurs in the cytoplasm so that the individual components can enter through the pore . How - ever , the fact that we see electron - dense virion particles within the nucleus supports our idea that intact virions are traversing the pore . NTS - harboring particles up to 26 nm in diameter have been shown to enter the nucleus through nuclear pores ( 31 , 32 ) . Therefore , passage of a virion particle with a diameter of - 50 nm ( 1 ) through a pore must accom - pany an opening of the channel larger than has been proposed ( 21 , 33 ) . These observations of virion nuclear entry could reflect flexibility of the pore to accommodate incoming particles . What makes SV40 virion particles karyophilic ? As has been shown in both DNA transfection and microinjection experiments , viral DNAs are infectious but appear to require a long latent period for gene expression ( 29 , 34 ) . The exper - iments reported here , therefore , suggest that viral structural proteins facilitate virion nuclear import as well as viral gene expression . So far , two nuclear targeting signals , Vpl - NLS and Vp2 / 3 - NTS , have been identified in the three structural proteins . Vpl - NLS ( 13 ) alone does not promote entry of nonnuclear protein ( 14 ) ; therefore , it is not an NTS and appears to be embedded inside the virion particle ( ref . 35 ; S . Harrison and R . Liddington , personal communication ) . Vp2 / 3 - NTS , which targets nonnuclear proteins to the nucleus ( 11 ) , could serve as SV40 - NTS for the virion nuclear entry . Although the molar ratio of both Vp2 and Vp3 proteins per particle is less than that of Vpl ( 36 ) , this NTS could be exposed at the surface of a virion particle and be accessible to the nuclear pore receptor ( s ) . Unfortunately , the location of Vp2 / 3 NTS relative to the Vpl chain in the virus has not been identified . Further structural as well as genetic studies may yield information regarding the geometrical configuration of the signal on the virion surface . We are grateful to Drs . L . Davis , D .
