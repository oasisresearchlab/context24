Email : turkeltp @ georgetown . edu Abstract Recent neuroimaging evidence indicates neural mechanisms that support transient improvements in creative performance ( augmented state creativity ) in response to cognitive interventions ( creativity cueing ) . Separately , neural interventions via tDCS show encouraging potential for modulating neuronal function during creative performance . If cognitive and neural interventions are separately effective , can they be combined ? Does state creativity augmentation represent “ real ” creativity , or do interventions simply yield divergence by diminishing meaningfulness / appropriateness ? Can augmenting state creativity bolster creative reasoning that supports innovation , particularly analogical reasoning ? To address these questions , we combined tDCS with creativity cueing . Testing a regionally speci ﬁ c hypothesis from neuroimaging , high - de ﬁ nition tDCS - targeted frontopolar cortex activity recently shown to predict state creativity augmentation . In a novel analogy ﬁ nding task , participants under tDCS formulated substantially more creative analogical connections in a large matrix search space ( creativity indexed via latent semantic analysis ) . Critically , increased analogical creativity was not due to diminished accuracy in discerning valid analogies , indicating “ real ” creativity rather than inappropriate divergence . A simpler relational creativity paradigm ( modi ﬁ ed verb generation ) revealed atDCS - by - cue interaction ; tDCS furtherenhanced creativity cue - related increases in semantic distance . Findings point to the potential of noninvasive neuromodulation to enhance creative relational cognition , including augmentation of the deliberate effort to formulate connections between distant concepts .

Creativity is just connecting things , ” and creative ideas occur when people “ are able to connect . . . and synthesize new things . ” Indeed , cre - ativity research indicates that new creative ideas often take the form connections between concepts that had previously seemed far apart ( Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ) . Relational cognition that reveals distant connections , especially in the form of analogical reasoning , is frequently a mechanism for generating creative leaps in the sciences , arts , education , and industry ( Bassok and Holyoak 1989 ; Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Costello and Keane 2000 ; Dunbar and Blanchette 2001 ; Dahl and Moreau 2002 ; Schunn et al . 2006 ; Chan et al . 2012 ; Pollack 2014 ) . There has long been interest in improving relational cognition ( Gick and Holyoak 1980 , 1983 ) , and current widespread recognition of the value of creative insights in the innovation economy ( IBM 2010 ; NSF 2011 , 2013 ; Harrison et al . 2012 ; Pollack 2014 ) makes efforts to boost creative relational cognition particularly timely . Creativity is a broad and multiplex construct . As we , among many , have argued ( Finke et al . 1992 ; Green 2016 ) , creativity re - search is most instructivewhen it seeks to parse out a particular creative process for close investigation rather than seeking to engage creativityas awhole . Thein ﬂ uential “ creativecognition ” approach ( Finke et al . 1992 ; Ward et al . 1995 , 1999 ) positsthat the most promising target processes for creativity research are the same processes that are cornerstones of complex cognition more broadly . In this respect , relational cognition — and espe - ciallyanalogical reasoning — is an appealing target for investiga - tion . Understanding the relatedness of experiences , ideas , objects , words , etc . is fundamental to successful cognition ( Hof - stadter 2001 ; Halford et al . 2010 ) , and the emergence of more ab - stract relational thinking in place of more super ﬁ cial featural similarity is a hallmark of human cognitive development ( Gen - tner 1988 ) . Rich theory and empirical work ( Sternberg 1977 ; Gick and Holyoak 1980 ; Gentner 1983 ; Morrison et al . 2004 ; Bunge et al . 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , and Dunbar 2006 ; Green , Fugel - sang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ; Green et al . 2008 ) has further parsed relational cognition into subprocesses at both the cognitive and neural levels , enabling a sharper focus for targeting constrained elements of creative cognition . A speci ﬁ c component process of relational cognition that has been a fruitful target for creativity research is the process of relational integration ( Green et al . 2010 ; Green , Kraemer , et al . 2012 ) , which refers to the formation of a uni ﬁ ed mental representation of a relation by integrating separate semantic elements ( e . g . , forming a uni ﬁ ed representa - tion of second - order relation by integrating multiple ﬁ rst - order relations in analogical reasoning ) . Relational integration is cog - nitively and neurally distinguishable from ( though largely over - lapping with ) other semantic processing components of relational cognition such as retrieval and alignment ( Green , Fu - gelsang , and Dunbar 2006 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ; Green et al . 2008 ) . Understanding how relational integra - tion works and whether it can be bolstered has obvious implica - tions for creative insights that rely on distant connections . However , consistent with the creative cognition approach , rela - tional integration is not only relevant to creativity but also ap - pears to support reasoning and decision - making functions more globally ( Christoff et al . 2001 ; Ramnani and Owen 2004 ; Koechlin and Hya ﬁ l 2007 ; Shamosh et al . 2008 ; Boorman et al . 2009 ; Halford et al . 2010 ) . Neuroimagingresearchhasprovidedconvergentimplications that an anterior prefrontal brain region , frontopolar cortex , sup - ports relational integration in service of analogical reasoning ( Christoffetal . 2001 ; Bunge etal . 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer et al . 2006 ; Green et al . 2010 ; Green , Kraemer , et al . 2012 ) , operat - ing in concert with temporal , parietal , and other prefrontal cor - tical regions ( Christoff et al . 2001 ; Morrison et al . 2004 ; Bunge et al . 2005 ; Geake and Hansen 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ; Krawczyk et al . 2008 ; Wendelken et al . 2008 ; Cho et al . 2009 ; Green et al . 2010 ; Volle et al . 2010 ; Hampshire et al . 2011 ; Bassok et al . 2012 ; Green , Kraemer , et al . 2012 ; Knowlton et al . 2012 ; Watson and Chatterjee 2012 ) . Notably , relational inte - gration of uni ﬁ ed representations from disparate semantic ele - ments in frontoplar cortex appears to cohere closely with the process of mapping unit representation of abstract , integrated concepts in frontopolar cortex within an elegant neurocomputa - tional architecture for relational reasoning proposed by Knowl - ton et al . ( 2012 ) . Indeed , several generally convergent models of prefrontal cognitive architecture indicate a rostro - caudal hierarchy in which frontopolar cortex integrates relatively less abstractpiecesofinformationtoformmorehighlyabstractrepre - sentations ( Christoff and Gabrieli 2000 ; Ramnani and Owen 2004 ; Badre and D ’ Esposito 2007 ; Knowlton et al . 2012 ) . Work in our la - boratory has found that increasing frontopolar activity paramet - rically re ﬂ ects increasing creativity in analogical reasoning , where creativity is measured quantitatively by “ semantic dis - tance ” between the concepts that analogies connect ( Green et al . 2010 ; Green , Kraemer , et al . 2012 ) . This may be because integrating representations that are more disparate ( i . e . , more distant from each other in semantic space ) places greater de - mand on frontopolar integration circuitry ( Green , Kraemer , et al . 2012 ; Green et al . 2015 ) ; for review , see Green ( 2016 ) . Recent evidence indicates that consciously directed effort to think more creatively yields more semantically distant connec - tions in analogy and simpler forms of relational cognition ( Green , Cohen , et al . 2012 ; Green et al . 2015 ) . This “ thinking cap ” effect ( i . e . , trying and succeeding at being more creative ) is com - monly experienced , and the recent ﬁ ndings in relational cogni - tion accord with prior ﬁ ndings in other areas of creative performance ( Gilchrist and Taft 1972 ; Harrington 1975 ; Runco and Okuda 1991 ; Seger et al . 2000 ; Niu and Sternberg 2001 ; O ’ Hara and Sternberg 2001 ; Chen et al . 2005 ; Howard - Jones et al . 2005 ) . Nonetheless , the potential of the thinking cap effect remains greatly underexplored by creativity research , which has traditionally focused instead on creativity as a static trait ( Guilford 1950 , 1967 ; Mayer 1999 ) . Intriguingly , we recently observed that conscious augmentation of performance on a cre - ative relational cognition taskwas associatedwith changes in ac - tivity and connectivity of frontopolar cortex ( Green et al . 2015 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the magnitude of increase in frontopolar activity predicted individual differences in the extent of increases in quantitativesemantic distance betweenwordsusedto formrela - tions . This suggests the possibility that neural intervention to potentiate increases in frontopolar activity might facilitate aug - mentation of state creativity with respect to the formation of dis - tant semantic connections ; that is , potentiation of frontopolar neurons might enhance the capacity of an individual to deliber - ately become a more semantically distant thinker . Separately from research on the thinking cap effect , direct neuromodulation via transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) has shown promise as another method to transiently aug - ment creative performance ( Cerruti and Schlaug 2009 ; Chi and Snyder 2011 , 2012 ; Chrysikou et al . 2013 ; Simis et al . 2014 ; Brunye et al . 2015 ; Colombo et al . 2015 ; Goel et al . 2015 ; Mayseless and 2629 Frontopolar tDCS and Relational Creativity Green et al . | Shamay - Tsoory 2015 ) . A timely question concerns the rela - tionship between neuromodulation and deliberate / conscious augmentation of state creativity . Given the evidence that con - scious , “ thinking cap ” state creativity augmentation is effective , including speci ﬁ c effects on relational cognition , can neuromo - dulation boost this effect further ? Another timely question about the potential of neuromodu - lation to augment creative cognition concerns analogical rea - soning , which no neuromodulation study to our knowledge has yet addressed . The rich literature demonstrating the unique power of analogy for learning and innovating ( Bassok and Holyoak 1989 ; Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Costello and Keane 2000 ; Dunbar and Blanchette 2001 ; Dahl and Moreau 2002 ; Schunn et al . 2006 ; Chan et al . 2012 ; Pollack 2014 ) suggests po - tentially far - reaching implications of augmenting analogy . At a construct level , analogical reasoning is an intriguing target forenhancement , because it bridgesthe divide between creativ - ity and IQ ( Holyoak 2012 ) . Thus , if analogical reasoning can be improved via neuromodulation , this would support extending the boundaries of tDCS ef ﬁ cacy from creativity to a form of intelligence . Finally , prior studies of the effects of cognitive and neural interventions on creativity have primarily focused on divergence ( i . e . , the novelty / unusualness of generated responses ) , whereas consensus criteria among creativity researchers require products to be both divergent and meaningful / appropriate to be consid - ered truly creative ; for review , see Runco and Jaeger ( 2012 ) . While state creativity manipulations are promising , it is not yet clear whether these interventions represent “ real ” creativity or simply yield divergence by diminishing constraints on meaning - fulness / appropriateness . Here , weaddressedthese issues in2tasksofcreativerelational cognition , an open - ended analogical reasoning task ( analogy ﬁ nding task ; Weinberger et al . 2016 ) , and a modi ﬁ ed verb gener - ation task ( thin slice creativity task ; Prabhakaran et al . 2014 ) . High - de ﬁ nition tDCS was used to potentiate neuronal activity of the speci ﬁ c frontopolar region in which increasing activity has been parametrically associated with increasing semantic distance in analogical reasoning ( Green et al . 2010 ; Green , Kraemer , et al . 2012 ) , and which has been shown to predict indi - vidual differences in state - related augmentation of creative per - formance in verb generation ( Green et al . 2015 ) . We tested the hypothesis that tDCS would interact with conscious augmenta - tion of state creativity to produce even greater increases in se - mantic distance in the thin slice creativity verb generation task , using an explicit creativity - cueing paradigm with known ef ﬁ cacy and good construct validity in relation to conventional measures of creativity ( Prabhakaran et al . 2014 ) . Whereas anodal stimula - tion produces reliable facilitation of performance on cognitive tasks , cathodal stimulation produces more variable direction and magnitude of effects from study to study ( Jacobson et al . 2012 ) . We therefore utilized anodal tDCS only , which allowed a clear directional hypothesis of enhanced creativity with active tDCS compared with sham stimulation . Based on our neuroima - ging ﬁ ndings ( Green et al . 2010 ; Green , Kraemer , et al . 2012 ) , we predicted that targeted frontopolar neuromodulation would bol - stercreative analogical reasoning and sought to test whetherany observed increases in creativity re ﬂ ected “ real ” creativity , rather than simply divergence at the expense of appropriateness . We employed a novel analogy ﬁ nding task paradigm that was devised to be suf ﬁ ciently open - ended to detect individual differ - ences in creative analogical reasoning , yet suf ﬁ ciently con - strained to enable sensitivity to inappropriate responding ( Weinberger et al . 2016 ) . Methods Participants Thirty - one right - handed , native English speakers ( 16 female , 15 male ; average age = 21 . 69± SD = 3 . 09 ) were recruited via ﬂ yer ad - vertisements on the Georgetown University campus and online via the Georgetown Research Volunteer Program and Research Match . Participants were randomly assigned to receive tDCS ( N = 15 ) or sham ( N = 16 ) . tDCS and sham groups did not differ by age ( tDCS : 22 . 50 ± 3 . 87 years ; Sham : 20 . 98 ± 2 . 08 years ; P = 0 . 183 ) , sex ( tDCS : 6 female ; Sham : 10 female ; P = 0 . 210 ) , years of education ( tDCS : 16 . 29± 2 . 05 years ; Sham : 15 . 13± 2 . 06 years ; P = 0 . 135 ) , par - ents ’ highest level of education ( P = 0 . 155 ) , household income ( tDCS : $ 75000 ± $ 31132 ; Sham : $ 80000 ± $ 33267 ; P = 0 . 675 ) , verbal IQ derived from subscales of the Multiple Aptitudes Battery - II ( MAB - II ; Jackson ( 1998 ) ; tDCS : 119 . 07± 13 . 53 ; Sham : 119 . 64± 7 . 95 ; P = 0 . 893 ) , mental rotations test accuracy ( MRT ; Vandenberg and Kuse 1978 ; Peters et al . 1995 ; tDCS : 48 . 81± 23 . 48 % ; Sham : 39 . 29± 18 . 77 % ; P = 0 . 246 ) , or self - reported SAT / ACT scores ( Cole and Gonyea 2010 ; tDCS : 2080 . 00 ± 240 . 28 ; Sham : 2103 . 57 ± 173 . 37 ; P = 0 . 768 ) . All participants gave written , informed consent in ac - cordance with the Georgetown University Institutional Review Board , which approved all procedures . Data for 5 participants ( 1 tDCS ; 4 sham ) were lost from the thin slice creativity verb gen - eration task due to a data collection software error . One tDCS participant ’ s data were lost from the analogical reasoning due to data collection software error . Two participants ( 1 tDCS ; 1 sham ) were excluded from the analogy ﬁ nding task analysis be - cause of extremely brief amounts of time taken to complete a task matrix ( < 20 s ) , which was deemed to indicate inappropriate attention devoted to task performance . Remaining group sizes nonetheless afforded 80 % power to detect an interaction of cre - ativity cue by neuromodulation in a planned mixed ANOVA model at a modest effect size of η 2 = 0 . 078 with α = 0 . 050 . Group sizes were also comparable with or greater than group sizes used in recent studies that have detected effects of tDCS on cre - ativity ( Cerruti and Schlaug 2009 ; Chrysikou et al . 2013 ; Brunye et al . 2015 ; Colombo et al . 2015 ; Mayseless and Shamay - Tsoory 2015 ) . The measures of verbal IQ , MRT , and self - reported SAT were obtained via an online follow - up survey as we described previously ( Ihne et al . 2016 ; Weinberger et al . 2016 ; see Supple - mentary Methods ) . Neuromodulation tDCS was administered using a DC Stimulator Plus ( NeuroConn GmbH , Ilmenau , Germany ) connected to a 4 ×1 HD - tDCS adapter ( Soterix Medical , Inc . , New York , NY , USA ) . The electrode mon - tage was designed with HD - Explore Version 3 . 1a software ( Soter - ix Medical , Inc . ) to maximize current ﬂ ow in the left frontopolar cortex . HD - Explore uses ﬁ nite element models to estimate the electrical ﬁ eld induced by a given HD - tDCS electrode montage ( Datta et al . 2009 ) . The anode was placed at 10 – 10 electrode site AF3 , and cathodes were placed at sites FPz , Fz , F7 , and FC3 ( Fig . 1 ) . This con ﬁ guration provided the optimal balance of focal - ityand magnitude of the modeled electrical ﬁ eld in left frontopo - lar cortex at the approximate location of peak activity in a recent paper on augmenting state creativity ( Green et al . 2015 ) , while minimizing outgoing , potentially inhibitory , current ﬂ ow through the left medial prefrontal cortex . The tDCS was applied through Ag / AgCl sintered ring electrodes , which were placed in plastic electrode holders ﬁ lled with electroconductive gel ( Signa gel ) and ﬁ ttedintoanEEGEasyCap . Acurrentof2 mAwasapplied attheanode , with0 . 5 mAineachofthecathodes . Thedurationof Cerebral Cortex , 2017 , Vol . 27 , No . 4 | 2630 stimulation was 20 min , with a 30 - s ramp up and down . Sham tDCS was applied using a 30 - s ramp up followed 15 s later by a 30 - s ramp down . Tasks Procedures Participants received anodal tDCS or sham for the ﬁ rst 20 min of thetestingsession . Duringthe ﬁ rst5 min , participants ﬁ lledouta brief demographics survey and then rested . Participants then completed the analogy ﬁ nding task , which was up to 5 min . Becausetheanalogy ﬁ ndingtaskwasself - paced , participants ﬁ n - ished at different times . To equate as much as possible the cog - nitive demands on participants during this window of the tDCS session , a ﬁ ller task was used in which participants were asked to speak aloud word pairs that were analogically related to word pairs appearing on the screen . This ﬁ ller task lasted from the end of the analogy ﬁ nding task until a point 14 min and 40 saftertheonsetoftDCS , suchthatallparticipantsparticipated in this task for at least 4 min and 40 s . Participants then com - pleted the thin slice creativity verb generation task for exactly 16 min in total ( 5 mins and 20 s during tDCS and 10 min and 40 s after ) . tDCS stimulation for 20 min , the duration used in the present study , has been shown to induce cortical excitability shifts that are stable at least an hour after cessation of active stimulation ( Nitsche and Paulus 2000 ; Nitsche et al . 2003 ) . The creativity tasks were presented , using a Dell Optiplex 390 with a 21 - inchLCDmonitorwitha120 Hzrefreshrate . Theanalogy ﬁ nd - ing task was presented from www . qualtrics . com , whereas the thin slice creativity verb generation task was presented using Eprime 2 . 0 . Spoken responses for the thin slice creativity verb generation task were recorded using a digital video camera and transcribed of ﬂ ine . Analogy Finding Task Analogical reasoning was tested using a novel analogy ﬁ nding task paradigm ( Weinberger et al . 2016 ) . The analogy ﬁ nding taskconsistedof2matricesofword - pairs ( AppendixA ) . Eachma - trix contained 5 word - pairs arranged in a column on the left side of the screen ( stem pairs ) and 20 word - pairs arranged in a row across the top of the screen ( completion pairs ) . Participants were instructed as follows : “ Your task is to make analogies by combining word - pairs on the left side of the grid with word - pairs along the top of the grid . Each word - pair should be read as ‘ [ Top Word ] is to [ Bottom Word ] ’ For example , ‘ Helmet is to Head . ’ Check the boxes to indicate when a word - pair from the top combines with a word - pair on the left to make a valid ana - logy . ” “ Please think creatively as you search for valid analogies . Some analogies may not be obvious right away , so be sure to look for abstract connections . However , only valid analogies should be listed , so don ’ t list analogies unless you can describe how the two word pairs are analogous . ” Each stem pair could be combined with 3 or4 completion pairsto form valid analogies , such that there were a total of 17 potential valid analogies that could be found within each matrix ( i . e . , valid analogies formed by combining one of the stem pairs with one of the completion pairs ) , and 83 potential word - pair combinations that yielded in - valid analogies in each matrix . There was no restriction against combining the same completion pair with > 1 stem pair and in - deedeachmatrixincluded1completionpairthatcouldbevalidly combined with 2 stem pairs . This was done to ensure that parti - cipants did not eliminate completion pairs from consideration , keeping the search space equivalently large throughout the task . For each stem pair of each matrix , the possible valid analo - gies represented a range of semantic distances . Varying the se - mantic distance of available analogical mappings in this way enabled us to discern individual differences in the creativity of the analogies participants formed . The requirement to form valid analogies while avoiding far more numerous invalid ana - logical connections enabled a sensitive measure of selectivity versusinappropriateresponding . Apilotstudy ( reportedinWein - berger et al . ( 2016 ) ) in 178 participants tested online via Amazon Mechanical Turk con ﬁ rmed that analogies intended to be valid were identi ﬁ ed far more frequently than analogies intended to be invalid , McNemar ’ s within - subjects χ 2 = 276 . 64 , P < 0 . 001 . Add - itionally , the validityof analogies was determined by domain ex - perts , and analogy items were largely drawn from sets of stimuli used in previous full and pilot studies in our laboratory that ob - tained high rates of participant accuracy . Thin Slice Creativity Verb Generation Task Weemployedthethinslice creativityverbgenerationtask , which we have described previously , and have validated in relation to a range of established creativity measures ( Prabhakaran et al . 2014 ; Green et al . 2015 ) . On each trial of the task , participants were pre - sented with a noun on a computer screen ( 8 s duration ; 250 ms ISI ) and asked to say a verb that was related to the noun in any way . A brief tone marked the beginning of each trial . Of the 120 nouns presented , half ( 60 ) were shown in the Cued condition Figure 1 . HD - tDCS electrode montage and electrical ﬁ eld model . Electrical ﬁ eld modeling was performed in HD - Explore 3 . 1a ( Soterix Medical , Inc . ) using the MNI - 152 template . The left panel shows the electrode locations rendered on the template head ( red = anode , black = cathode ) . The middle panel shows an axial slice at the level of the maximal ﬁ eld . Black arrows depict the directional current ﬂ ow vectors . The right panel depicts the total electrical ﬁ eld magnitude rendered on the template brain surface . Renderings were provided courtesy of Chris Thomas and Dr Abhishek Datta of Soterix Medical , Inc . 2631 Frontopolar tDCS and Relational Creativity Green et al . | and the other half ( 60 ) in the Uncued condition . Conditions were indicated by the color in which thewords were presented ( green or purple ) , and we counterbalanced which color indicated which condition between subjects . For nouns presented in the Cued color , participants were instructed to “ think creatively when coming up with your response . ” Conditions were inter - leaved such that 2 trials of each condition were followed by 2 trials of the other condition . This design allowed us to investi - gate acute engagement of state creativity while minimizing set shifting and executive attention demands ( e . g . , from unpre - dictable or surprising shifts ) , which were not the intended tar - gets of investigation . We have previously demonstrated that this design avoids confounds of set shifting ( Green et al . 2015 ) . We further counterbalanced 2 lists of noun prompts presented in the Cued versus Uncued conditions , crossed with the coun - terbalancing of the cue colors to yield a total of 4 counterbalan - cing cells . The2counterbalanced listsofnounpromptswereequatedfor word length ( number of letters ; t ( 118 ) = 1 . 22 , P = 0 . 225 ) and average constraint , t ( 118 ) = − 0 . 014 , P = 0 . 989 , where constraint refers to the extent to which the noun is associated with a single common verb associate ( Barch et al . 2000 ) . Constraint level was based on normative pilot data from testing in an independent sample ( verb responses were obtained for each noun from 62 – 85 adults as part of a larger set of verb generation stimuli ; no creativity cue manipulation was used in this pilot testing ; see Prabhakaran et al . ( 2014 ) ) . For example , the noun prompt , “ Pie , ” was relatively high constraint because > 75 % of pilot participants generated the same verb response , “ Eat , ” whereas the noun prompt , “ Dirt , ” was relatively low constraint because no single verb response ac - counted for as much as 25 % of responses . From a full list of 161 piloted nouns , the present study included the 60 highest con - straint and 60 lowest constraint nouns . The sequence of high - versus low - constraint noun prompts was randomized . The ﬁ rst 40 noun prompts ( presented during active tDCS ) and last 80 noun prompts ( presented after cessation of tDCS ) did not differ in constraint ( t ( 118 ) = 0 . 056 , P = 0 . 955 ) or in word length ( t ( 118 ) = 0 . 788 , P = 0 . 432 ) . Calculation of Semantic Distance Creativity of responding in both tasks was quanti ﬁ ed using a measure of semantic distance derived via latent semantic analysis ( LSA ; Landauer and Dumais 1997 ; Landauer et al . 1998 ; Dumais 2004 ; http : / / lsa . colorado . edu ) . We used the topic space of “ general reading up to ﬁ rst year college ( 300 factors ) ” and term - to - term comparison type . This measure of semantic distance corresponds to the cosine of the angle between vectors ( corresponding , in our usage , to the terms of each analogyor the noun prompt and the verb response ) within a given semantic space , which is derived through analyses of all of the contexts in which each word tends to be present or absent in that topic space ( Landauer et al . 1998 ) . Semantic distance determined via LSA is a reliable and construct - valid measure of creativity ( Wolfe and Goldman 2003 ; Forster and Dunbar 2009 ; Green et al . 2010 ; Prabhakaran et al . 2014 ) , and has previously been shown to be a quanti ﬁ able measure of creativity in analogical reasoning that correlates with subjective creativity ratings of analogies ( Green et al . 2010 ) . Outputs from LSA computations directly re ﬂ ect semantic proximity rather than semantic dis - tance , with values ranging from 0 to 1 . Thus , for ease of inter - pretation , we subtracted the raw values from 1 to represent semantic distance and then multiplied by 10 so that values are whole numbers . Results Analogical Reasoning ( Analogy Finding Task ) The total semantic distance of valid analogies formed in the analogy ﬁ nding task matrix was greater for tDCS ( M = 1468 . 08 , SD = 323 . 58 ) than sham ( M = 1121 . 93 , SD = 426 . 92 ) , t ( 26 ) = 2 . 39 , P = 0 . 025 , d = 0 . 94 ( Fig . 2 ) . The total , rather than the average , semantic distance was usedastheprimarymeasureofcreativeanalogicalreasoning , be - cause averages were deemed likely to provide misleading repre - sentations of the ability to formulate creative analogies . For example , it was possible to identify very few analogies ( as few as one ) and yet to have a high average semantic distance . None - theless , the analysis of average semantic distance also revealed an increase under tDCS ( t ( 26 ) = 2 . 09 , P = 0 . 046 , d = 0 . 82 ) . The total number of valid analogies identi ﬁ ed , which is related but not in - formationally identical to total semantic distance , was also greater for tDCS ( M = 20 . 69 , SD = 3 . 72 ) relative to sham ( M = 16 . 67 , SD = 4 . 76 , t ( 26 ) = 2 . 46 , P = 0 . 021 , d = 0 . 96 ) . A nominally larger total number of responses ( valid or not ) under tDCS did not reach sig - ni ﬁ cance ( t ( 26 ) = 2 . 00 , P = 0 . 056 , d = 0 . 78 ) . Critically , the increase in semantic distance of analogy formation was not accompanied by an increase in the number of “ false alarm ” analogies formed under tDCS or in the number of false alarms as a proportion of the total number of analogies ( both P > 0 . 385 ) . Univariate ANCO - VA comparing total semantic distance of valid analogies for tDCS versus Sham , with number of false alarms as a covariate , con - ﬁ rmed that the effect of tDCS on semantic distance was inde - pendent of false alarms ( F 1 , 25 = 4 . 67 , P = 0 . 040 , η 2 = 0 . 16 ) . The false alarms covariate was not signi ﬁ cantly related to semantic distance in this model ( F 1 , 25 = 1 . 68 , P = 0 . 206 , η 2 = 0 . 06 ) . Indeed , the sensitivity index ( d ′ ) calculated as standardized false alarms subtracted from standardized valid analogies did not show a decrease under tDCS and actually showed a nominal though nonsigni ﬁ cant increase ( t ( 26 ) = 1 . 15 , P = 0 . 261 , d = 0 . 45 ) . tDCS ( M = 231 . 15 s , SD = 21 . 89 ) was associated with nominally longer aver - agetimetocompletetheanalogy ﬁ ndingtaskrelativetosham ( M = 194 . 86 s , SD = 68 . 86 ) though this difference did not reach signi ﬁ - cance , t ( 26 ) = 1 . 82 , P = 0 . 081 , d = 0 . 71 ) .

Verb Generation ( Thin Slice Creativity Task ) A 2 ( Cue : Creativity Cued , Uncued ) × 2 ( Stimulation : tDCS , Sham ) mixed ANOVA revealed a within - subjects main effect of Cue ( F 1 , 24 = 75 . 81 , P < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 76 ) indicating that verb responses were more semantically distant from noun prompts in the Cued condition ; a between - subjects main effect of Stimulation ( F 1 , 24 = 9 . 09 , P = 0 . 006 , η 2 = 0 . 28 ) indicating more semantically dis - tant verb responses for tDCS than sham ; and , critically , an inter - action of Cue by stimulation ( F 1 , 24 = 6 . 90 , P = 0 . 015 , η 2 = 0 . 22 ) indicating that Cued responding was more semantically distant during tDCS ( Fig . 3 ) . Planned t - tests revealed that the interaction was due to an effect of stimulation in the presence of the creativ - ity cue , t ( 24 ) = 4 . 19 , P < 0 . 001 , d = 1 . 71 , but not in the absence of the cue , t ( 24 ) = 0 . 13 , P = 0 . 895 , d = 0 . 05 . The evidence that participants assigned to the tDCS and sham groups did not differ in creative performance in the absence of the cue also provides an indi - cation that the 2 groups were equated for baseline levels of creativity . To investigate effects of the constraint level of noun prompts , a within - subjects factor ( Constraint : High , Low ) was added to the ANOVA model . This model recon ﬁ rmed the main effects of Cue ( F 1 , 24 = 76 . 92 , P < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 76 ) ; and Stimulation ( F 1 , 24 = 9 . 50 , P = 0 . 005 , η 2 = 0 . 28 ) ; and the interaction of Cue by Stimulation ( F 1 , 24 = 96 . 22 , P = 0 . 017 , η 2 = 0 . 22 ) . Additionally , this model identi - ﬁ ed a main effect of Constraint ( F 1 , 24 = 96 . 22 , P < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 80 ) indicating that , as expected , low - constraint noun prompts eli - cited more semantically distant verb responses ; an interaction of Cue by Constraint ( F 1 , 24 = 10 . 79 , P = 0 . 003 , η 2 = 0 . 31 ) indicating that constraint level had less effect on Cued noun prompts ; an interaction of Stimulation by Constraint that approached but did not reach signi ﬁ cance ( F 1 , 24 = 3 . 38 , P = 0 . 078 , η 2 = 0 . 12 ) , sug - gesting a greatereffect of tDCS for high constraint noun prompts ; and no 3 - way interaction ( F 1 , 24 = 0 . 133 , P = 0 . 718 , η 2 < 0 . 01 ) . Con - ﬁ rmatory 2 × 2 models demonstrated signi ﬁ cant interactions of Constraint by Cue ( F 1 , 25 = 11 . 05 , P = 0 . 003 , η 2 = 0 . 31 ) and Constraint by Stimulation ( F 1 , 24 = 6 . 90 , P = 0 . 015 , η 2 = 0 . 22 ) . The apparatus for recording spoken verb responses was sep - arate from the stimulus presentation software , so reliable mea - sures of response time were not readily obtained . Though response time was not an outcome measure of primary interest , an effort was made to reconstruct response times from videos of participants performing the thin slice creativity verb generation task . This reconstructed response time measure did not indicate maineffectsofCueorStimulation , oraCue - by - Stimulationinter - action ( all P > 0 . 670 ) . Discussion The present study addressed questions about the potential of cognitive and neural interventionsto augment relational creativ - ity ( i . e . , forming connections between distant concepts ) . An explicit creativity cueing paradigm with known ef ﬁ cacy ( Green , Cohen , et al . 2012 ; Prabhakaran et al . 2014 ; Green et al . 2015 ; Weinberger et al . 2016 ) was used in 2 tasks of relational cogni - tion , analogical reasoning , and modi ﬁ ed verb generation . Cre - ativity cueing was combined with high - de ﬁ nition tDCS targeted to potentiate activity in a frontopolar region that has been shown to re ﬂ ect increasing semantic distance of relation - al integration in analogical reasoning ( Green et al . 2010 ; Green , Kraemer , et al . 2012 ) and to predict the ef ﬁ cacy of conscious state creativity augmentation in thin slice creativity verb generation ( Green et al . 2015 ) . Data indicated that tDCS was ef - fective in eliciting more creative ( semantically distant ) ana - logical reasoning without decreasing the meaningfulness / appropriateness of analogies , and that tDCS interacted with creativity cueing to facilitate more creative responding in verb generation . To teststatecreativityeffectsonanalogicalreasoning , weem - ployed a novel analogy ﬁ nding task , which measures the ability to identify creative analogical connections in a large matrix of possible word - pair combinations . Analogy is a good model for creativity in reasoning because analogies can involve greatdiver - gence ( highly creative analogies reveal hidden similarities be - tween items or concepts that seem unrelated on the surface ) , but is also clearly constrained ( to be valid , the pieces of an ana - logy must align with each other in meaningful / appropriate ways ( Sternberg 1977 ; Gentner 1983 ; Hummel and Holyoak 1997 ) ) . These attributes of divergence and meaningfulness / appropriateness make analogy a form of reasoning that meets the modern consensus de ﬁ nition of creativity ( for review , see Runco and Jaeger ( 2012 ) ) . Studies of creativity in analogical rea - soning have generally focused on the evaluation of fully formed singleton analogies of the form “ A is to B as C is to D , ” or comple - tion of nearly formed singleton analogies ( Green , Cohen , et al . 2012 ; Vendetti et al . 2014 ) . These paradigms greatly limit the search space in which reasoners seek and evaluate analogical connections . Valuable creative insights in real - world contexts cannot often be gained by simply assessing the validity of a fully formed analogyoradding a single term to complete a nearly formed analogy . Rather , creative analogical insights generally re - quire the reasoner to seek out and ﬁ nd analogical connections that others may have missed among a broad array of possible concept combinations , where most of the possible combinations do not lead to valid analogies ( Gick and Holyoak 1980 , 1983 ; Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Costello and Keane 2000 ; Dunbar and Blanchette 2001 ; Dahl and Moreau 2002 ; Schunn et al . 2006 ; Figure3 . EffectoftDCSversussham ( between - subjects ) andCuedversusUncued condition ( within - subjects ) on semantic distance of verb responses in the Thin Slices of Creativity task . Verb responses were uniformly more distant from noun prompts in the presence of the creativity cue . Anodal tDCS of frontopolar cortex augmented this effect , such that responding was most semantically distant when tDCS was combined with the creativity cue . Error bars represent 1 SEM . 2633 Frontopolar tDCS and Relational Creativity Green et al . | Chan et al . 2012 ) . Thus , the much broader search space of the analogy ﬁ nding task was designed to better inform under - standing of the kind of reasoning that supports innovation . Be - cause 83 of the 100 available connections between word - pairs in each analogy ﬁ nding task matrix yielded invalid analogies , the task is highly sensitive to inappropriate responding . This en - abled us to test whether putatively augmented state creativity in analogical reasoning might simply be due to participants de - creasing the stringency with which they discern valid analogical connections ( i . e . , divergence at the expense of meaningfulness / appropriateness ) . Comparison of tDCS with sham ( both administered in the presence of the creativity cue ) yielded 2 key results . First , tDCS elicited the formation of more creative ( semantically distant ) analogies . Second , this increase in the creativity of analogical reasoning was not due to an increase in invalid / false alarm ana - logies , and indeed false alarm analogies did not increase under tDCS . These ﬁ ndings provide evidence that tDCS can improve a valuable form of creative intelligence , analogical reasoning , which no tDCS study to our knowledge has explored . Based on prior evidence , it is likely that neuromodulation of frontopolar cortex facilitated the relational integration function subserved by this region during analogical reasoning ( Christoff et al . 2001 ; Bunge et al . 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer et al . 2006 ) , especially facilitating more semantically distant relational integration that appears to place greater demand on frontopolar circuitry ( Green et al . 2010 ; Green , Kraemer et al . 2012 ) . Toexploretheinteractionbetweenneuralandcognitiveinter - vention , we used a repeated , “ on - off ” creativity cue paradigm in the thin slice creativity verb generation task , which we have pre - viously validated in relation to established measures of creativity ( Prabhakaran et al . 2014 ) . This paradigm provides a robust meas - ure of the effect of cognitive state creativity intervention because an augmented creative state is dynamically engaged and disen - gaged multiple times in response to explicit cueing ( 60 times in the present study ) . As expected , the creativity cue led to in - creased semantic distance in verb generation in both the tDCS and sham groups . tDCS did not yield greater semantic distance than sham in the absence of the creativity cue . However , tDCS in - teracted with the creativity cue such that semantic distance was greater for tDCS than sham in the presence of the creativity cue . These ﬁ ndings appear to be consistent with recent evidence that the extent of activation increase in the frontopolar region we tar - geted predicts individual extent of increase in semantic distance during the thin slice creativity task ( Green et al . 2015 ) . If increas - ing frontopolar cortex is a neural mechanism that supports suc - cessful conscious augmentation of relational creativity ( i . e . , forming more distant relations between semantic representa - tions ) , then potentiating frontopolar activity via anodal tDCS may facilitate this augmentation . Indeed , our data indicate that neuromodulation of frontopolar cortex may enhance the cap - acity to deliberately formulate more semantically distant rela - tional connections . The present experimental manipulation data converge with prior observational data from neuroimaging that have sug - gested a role for frontopolar cortex in relational integration ( Christoff and Gabrieli 2000 ; Bunge et al . 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ) . Taken as a whole , this body of evidence concerning frontopolar cortex as an integrator of information to formulate abstract representations based on more caudally represented semantic elements appears well ﬁ tted to the gen - eralform ofarostro - caudalhierarchicalmodel ofprefrontalcog - nition that has emerged from the convergence of several important accounts ( Christoff and Gabrieli 2000 ; Ramnani and Owen 2004 ; Badre and D ’ Esposito 2007 ; Knowlton et al . 2012 ) . Ramnani and Owen ( 2004 ) , identifying coherence between neu - rocognitive data and histological architecture , noted that exten - sive arborization relative to cell size in frontopolar neurons suggestswiring optimizedforintegration , particularlyin service of abstract representations . Knowlton et al . ( 2012 ) have proposed a neurocomputational account of relational reasoning ( including analogy ) in which a hierarchical progression of “ role bindings ” of semantic elements within a propositional information structure culminates in the abstract , integratedrepresentationofsimilaritiesbetweenpropo - sitions . The authors suggest that these highest level integrated representations ( mapping units ) are instantiated by neuronal ac - tivity in frontopolar cortex . Interpreted in this context , it may be that anodal tDCS in the present study facilitated frontopolar cir - cuitry in accessing and / or integrating lower order role bindings . The account proposed by Knowlton and colleagues speci ﬁ es that synchronization in the gamma and theta bands facilitates relational binding in the frontal lobes , and that cross frequency coupling between theta and gamma oscillations provides a mechanism for coordination between parietal storage areas and frontal relational processors , including the frontopolar cor - tex . Anodal tDCS has previously been shown to increase gamma power in hippocampal slice preparations ( Reato et al . 2015 ) , and both theta and gamma power when applied over the prefrontal cortex in humans ( Miller et al . 2015 ) . tDCS is thought to increase synchronization of brain networks connected to the directly stimulated area ( Kunze et al . Forthcoming ) , and in some cases , anodal tDCS has been shown to increase theta co - herence between the frontal and parietal lobes ( Polania et al . 2011 ; Notturno et al . 2014 ) . Thus , although we did not measure changes in theta or gamma oscillations here , our ﬁ ndings are potentially consistent with the account by Knowlton and collea - gues , which predicts that enhancing frontoparietal theta coher - ence and prefrontal theta and gamma would augment the ability to draw more distant conceptual relationships . Additional research using alternating current stimulation to enhance oscil - lations at speci ﬁ c frequencies will be needed to con ﬁ rm this hypothesis . A worthy goal for future empirical and theoretical research is to characterize the interaction between extant hierarchical pre - frontal neurocognitive architectures and emerging efforts to identify neural systems common to multiple forms of creativity . Promising brain - based accounts of creativity have emphasized connectivity between prefrontal executive cortical regions and the so - called default mode network of frontal and posterior mid - lineregions ( Jungetal . 2013 ; Beatyetal . 2016 ) . These accounts as - cribe an idea - generative function to default mode regions within the process of developing original thoughts , whereas prefrontal executive regions instantiate evaluative selection of ideas based on relevant constraints . It is unlikely that frontopolar cor - tex , acortical region corresponding roughly to Brodmann area 10 , can be grouped with the classical , task - negative default mode network ( Raichle et al . 2001 ) given the extensive evidence that frontopolar activity shows task - positive responsivity across a range of cognitive domains including reasoning , economic deci - sion - making , and branching / sub - goaling in addition to creativity ( for relevant reviews , see Ramnani and Owen ( 2004 ) ; Gilbert et al . ( 2006 ) ; Koechlin and Hya ﬁ l ( 2007 ) ; Knowlton et al . ( 2012 ) ; Green ( 2016 ) ) , and that increasing task demand results in increased ra - ther than decreased frontopolar activity ( Koechlin and Hya ﬁ l 2007 ; Green 2016 ) . The present data suggest that potentiating greater activity in frontopolar cortex facilitated both a primarily Cerebral Cortex , 2017 , Vol . 27 , No . 4 | 2634 generative task ( verb generation ) and a primarily evaluative task ( analogy ﬁ nding ) , consistent with prior work showing frontopolar involvement in both evaluation and generation ( Bunge et al . 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , and Dunbar 2006 ; Wendelk - en et al . 2008 ; Green , Kraemer et al . 2012 ; Green 2016 ) . Nonethe - less , frontopolar cortex is proximate to generally more ventral regionsthat have been identi ﬁ ed with the default mode network , andfrontopolarfunctionmaywellservetohelpintegratethepro - ducts of a putative default mode idea generator and / or integrate default mode network contributions with the category - and rule - based constraints of proximate lateral prefrontal executive regions ( Bunge et al . 2003 ; Cromer et al . 2010 ) . Within any model of creativity in the brain , it is certain that frontopolar cortex represents only one component / node within a considerably larger network . The present ﬁ ndings are useful in demonstrating gains that can be achieved by stimulating the frontopolar component of creativity - related brain function in the tasks we employed , but future work will be necessary to as - sess the respective contributions ( and potential enhancement ) of other candidate nodes identi ﬁ ed in emerging models . Future research should also seek to test whether individual differences in trait intelligence and creative abilities might moderate the ef - fects of neuromodulation . The present study ’ s relatively small and homogeneous cohort of high - achieving undergraduates at a selective university limits our ability to adequately address such questions . Early evidence suggests that tDCS interventions can transi - ently improve creative performance ( Cerruti and Schlaug 2009 ; Chi and Snyder 2011 , 2012 ; Chrysikou et al . 2013 ; Simis et al . 2014 ; Brunye etal . 2015 ; Colombo etal . 2015 ; Goeletal . 2015 ; May - seless and Shamay - Tsoory 2015 ) , though far more work will be required to distinguish effects on speci ﬁ c cognitive components thatsupport creativity . To our knowledge , the interaction of tDCS by conscious state creativity augmentation has not yet been ex - plored in any creative process . Cerruti and Schlaug ( 2009 ) found that anodal , but not cathodal , tDCS applied to left , but not right , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) elicited better per - formance on the Remote Associates Test ( Mednick 1968 ) , which is sometimes used as a measure of verbal creativity though that study did not involve any cognitive manipulation of state creativity . Colombo et al . ( 2015 ) also reported an effect of tDCS on DLPFC , but collapsed analyses across tDCS foci in left and right hemispheres , making anatomical effects dif ﬁ cult to inter - pret . That study incorporated an implicit cue intended to either constrain or broaden creative thinking in a uses - of - objects task , but the priming manipulation did not have the intended effect ( it did not yield a main effect on creative responding ) . Prime - by - stimulation interactions were not examined , nor were effects of explicit , conscious augmentation of state creativity since the priming manipulation was implicit . Onlyone study to our knowl - edge has used tDCS to target frontopolar cortex ( Brunye et al . 2015 ) . That study did not employ a cognitive state creativity ma - nipulation and , consistent with our ﬁ nding of no tDCS effect in the absence of the cue , did not observe an effect of tDCS on se - mantic distance of verb generation . In addition to the changes in activity within frontopolar cortex , our recent neuroimaging investigation of augmented state creativity ( Green et al . 2015 ) implicated increased frontopo - lar connectivity with anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) and right anterior prefrontal cortex activity , as well as increased activity in inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) , which is strongly connected with frontopolar cortex . The involvement of these regions is likely to re ﬂ ect greater demands on response selection / inhibition when forming more creative semantic connections ( Barch et al . 2000 ; Braver et al . 2001 ; Badre et al . 2005 ; Hampshire et al . 2010 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . 2013 ; Aron et al . 2014 ) . Forming a more cre - ative connection requires consideration of a greater number of possible connections and often requires the inhibition of the ﬁ rst response that comes to mind to select a more creative re - sponse . Given that tDCS affects not only the area of cortex direct - ly exposed to the electrical ﬁ eld but also the network of distant brain areas connected to the stimulated area ( Stagg et al . 2013 , Polania et al . 2011 ) , it is probable that the focal frontopolar stimu - lation administered here had downstream effects on inhibitory centers of the frontal lobe . Such effects are likely to amplify in - creases in functional connectivity that occur in response to the creativity cue ( Green et al . 2015 ) . Indeed , the particularly large ef - fect of tDCS for high - constraint noun prompts in the present study indicates that inhibiting the effect of prepotent associa - tions is a component of the mechanism by which neuromodula - tion facilitates creativity . The integrative function of frontopolar cortex appears to support the actual formation of creative con - nections ( Ramnani and Owen 2004 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer et al . 2006 ; Green et al . 2010 ; Green and Kraemer et al . 2012 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . 2013 ) , but it is likely that this process occurs in concert with contributions of ACC and other regions that in - hibit prepotent responding to make “ outside the box ” connec - tions more available . Conclusions Departing from traditional research treatments of creativity as a static trait , evidence of neural mechanisms that support dyna - mism in creative performance suggests the encouraging poten - tial of targeted cognitive and neural interventions . Here , we leveraged insights from neuroimaging to target stimulation of a frontopolar region where we predicted that potentiating neuron - al activity would facilitate augmentation of state creativity . Re - sults provide novel evidence that tDCS enhances the conscious augmentation of state creativity elicited by cognitive interven - tion , and extend the known boundaries of tDCS enhancement to analogical reasoning , a form of creative intelligence that is a powerful engine for innovation .
