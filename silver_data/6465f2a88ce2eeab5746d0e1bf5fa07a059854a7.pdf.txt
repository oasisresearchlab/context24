These pathways include the cytoskeleton , a proteinaceous network that senses 24 external cues at the cell surface and signals to interior cellular components . During biotic stress , 25 dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements serve as a platform from which early immune - associated 26 processes are organized and activated . Bacterial pathogens of plants and animals use proteins 27 called type III effectors ( T3Es ) to interfere with host immune signaling , thereby promoting 28 virulence . We previously found that RipU , a T3E from the soilborne phytobacterial pathogen 29 Ralstonia solanacearum K60 ( Rs K60 ) , co - localizes with the plant cytoskeleton . Here , we show 30 that RipU from Rs K60 ( RipU K60 ) physically associates with both actin and tubulin and disrupts 31 actin and microtubule cytoskeleton organization . We find that pharmacological disruption of the 32 tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) cytoskeleton promotes Rs K60 colonization . RipU K60 suppresses 33 cell surface - triggered immune responses including flg22 - mediated reactive oxygen species 34 ( ROS ) production and callose deposition . Importantly , tomato plants inoculated with Rs K60 35 lacking RipU K60 ( Δ ripU K60 ) had reduced wilting symptoms and significantly reduced root 36 colonization when compared to plants inoculated with wild - type Rs K60 . Collectively , our data 37 suggest that Rs K60 uses the type III effector RipU K60 to remodel cytoskeletal organization , 38 thereby promoting pathogen virulence . 39 40 3 Introduction 41 Microbial pathogens use virulence proteins known as type III effector proteins ( T3Es ) to cause 42 disease in plants and animals . T3Es are secreted and retained in the plant cell extracellular space 43 ( apoplast ) or translocated into the plant cell cytoplasm where they subsequently interact with and 44 manipulate host proteins to suppress a diverse range of processes , including immune signaling 45 [ 1 – 3 ] . The cytoskeleton is an intracellular filamentous network that is essential for cellular 46 homeostasis and is a critical part of immune signaling in eukaryotes [ 4 – 7 ] . Several T3Es from 47 plant and animal pathogenic bacteria interact directly or indirectly with components of the 48 cytoskeleton and suppress immune responses [ 1 , 7 – 10 ] . The underlying cellular mechanisms for 49 how pathogen - derived effectors manipulate the cytoskeleton , how such manipulation interferes 50 with immune signaling , and how this promotes pathogen virulence remain largely unknown . 51 Knowledge as to how pathogenic bacteria manipulate cellular targets will likely provide insight 52 into host - microbe cellular biology as well as contribute to our understanding of putative disease 53 control strategies [ 11 , 12 ] . 54 Ralstonia solanacearum ( Rs ) is a soil - borne pathogen that causes bacterial wilt disease in over 55 250 plant species , including economically and agriculturally important cash crops such as potato 56 ( Solanum tuberosum ) , pepper ( Capsicum annum ) , and tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) [ 13 – 17 ] . 57 Similar to other pathogenic bacteria , Rs utilizes T3E proteins to promote its virulence , but host 58 targets are not well defined [ 18 , 19 ] . In most crop species , host genetic resistance to Rs is a 59 quantitative trait and relies upon the action of several genomic regions known as quantitative 60 trait loci ( QTL ) [ 17 , 20 – 22 ] . Despite the importance of Rs worldwide , mechanisms underlying 61 this quantitative resistance remain largely unknown , but likely involve developmental and basal 62 immune processes [ 13 , 16 , 23 ] . 63 Immune signaling pathways and their associated proteins are frequent targets of T3Es in plants 64 and animals . During early invasion by microbes , eukaryotic host cells recognize Microbe 65 Associated Molecular Patterns ( MAMPs ) . MAMP recognition elicits a set of downstream 66 signaling events , including production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , calcium ( Ca 2 + ) influx , 67 and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) phosphorylation , which ultimately lead to 68 changes in host defense gene transcription and together are known as pattern - triggered immunity 69 ( PTI ) [ 24 ] . The cytoskeleton is an essential signaling intermediate during PTI [ 4 , 5 , 7 ] . This 70 4 intracellular filamentous network controls cell shape and division , organellar movement , 71 endocytosis and secretion , and provides the channels for intracellular and extracellular 72 trafficking . In plants , the cytoskeleton is composed of two major filament systems , actin and 73 microtubules , along with many additional accessory proteins that are required for cytoskeletal 74 function [ 25 ] . During immune signaling in both plants and animals , the actin cytoskeleton is 75 dynamically linked to ROS burst and Ca 2 + changes , promote antimicrobial protein transport , and 76 facilitate immune receptor dynamics at the plasma membrane [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 26 – 28 ] . In both plants and 77 animals , inhibiting cytoskeleton dynamics with either genetic mutants or pharmacological 78 inhibitors can promote pathogen virulence [ 27 , 29 – 31 ] . 79 Both actin and microtubules transiently polymerize and depolymerize in response to internal and 80 external stimuli , including beneficial and pathogenic microbes [ 4 , 5 , 7 ] . For example , fungal and 81 oomycete invasion promotes actin filament accumulation at the attempted point of penetration 82 [ 32 – 35 ] . Additionally , a transient increase in the density of cortical actin filaments occurs within 83 minutes after bacterial MAMP perception in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) and is an early 84 marker of PTI [ 29 , 36 , 37 ] . Arabidopsis mutants defective in early actin remodeling or dynamics 85 are more susceptible to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato DC3000 ( Pst 86 DC3000 ) [ 29 ] and have altered immune outputs including callose production and defense gene 87 activation [ 36 – 40 ] . Significant changes in microtubule organization in response to MAMPs or 88 pathogen perception are less well characterized . Microtubule reorganization occurs in response 89 to both beneficial fungi and during pathogen invasion [ 41 , 42 ] . How MAMP recognition leads to 90 changes in cytoskeleton organization and dynamics , and how this remodeling promotes immune 91 signaling and resistance remains largely unknown , although several actin binding proteins are 92 required for changes in actin organization [ 36 , 37 , 40 ] . 93 The underlying cellular mechanisms for how pathogen - derived effectors manipulate the 94 cytoskeleton , how such manipulation interferes with immune signaling , and how this promotes 95 pathogen virulence remain largely unknown . Nevertheless , several T3Es from phytopathogenic 96 bacteria target either the actin or microtubule cytoskeleton . For example , the Pseudomonas 97 syringae effectors HopW1 and HopG1 [ 30 , 43 , 44 ] as well as XopR from Xanthomonas 98 campestris [ 39 ] alter actin structure and organization either by directly interacting with actin 99 filaments ( HopW1 ) or by interfering with actin associated proteins ( XopR and HopG1 ) . 100 5 Additional T3Es impact microtubules either directly or indirectly . XopL from X . euvesicatoria 101 directly interacts with microtubules and causes cell death when transiently expressed in N . 102 benthamiana [ 45 ] . Transient expression of HopZa1 from P . syringae causes destruction of 103 microtubule networks , inhibits protein secretion , and suppresses cell wall - mediated defenses 104 [ 31 ] . The T3Es HopE1 and AvrBsT indirectly impact microtubule organization by interfering 105 with microtubule associated proteins MAP65 [ 46 ] and ACIP1 [ 47 ] , respectively . 106 107 We previously showed that RipU K60 , a T3E from Rs strain K60 , qualitatively co - localizes with 108 the actin cytoskeleton in tomato roots and leaves of N . benthamiana , suggesting it may have a 109 functional role in cytoskeleton - mediated immune signaling [ 19 ] . Here , using high - resolution 110 spinning disk confocal microscopy ( SDCM ) and quantitative image analysis , we demonstrate 111 that RipU K60 alters the organization of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton . We find that 112 RipU K60 physically associates with both tubulin and actin as well as suppresses host immune 113 responses including reactive oxygen species production and callose deposition in response to the 114 MAMP elicitor , flagellin22 ( flg22 ) . Cytoskeleton disruption using the pharmacological inhibitors 115 LatrunculinB ( LatB ; actin ) or oryzalin ( microtubules ) promotes Rs colonization in tomato roots , 116 demonstrating that the cytoskeleton has a functional role in Rs recognition . A Rs mutant lacking 117 RipU K60 has decreased virulence and colonization in naturalistic soil drench assays . Collectively , 118 our data suggest that RipU K60 promotes Rs virulence likely by associating and interfering with 119 the dynamics and organization of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton . 120 Results 121 A Rs Type III effector co - localizes with the cytoskeleton 122 Using laser scanning confocal microscopy we previously showed that the Rs K60 T3E RipU K60 123 qualitatively co - localized with actin [ 19 ] . To assess this association quantitatively and extend the 124 analysis to the microtubule cytoskeleton , we investigated the subcellular localization of RipU K60 - 125 GFP using spinning disk confocal microscopy ( SDCM ) following transient co - expression in N . 126 benthamiana leaves with cytoskeletal reporters . After confirming that RipU K60 is secreted 127 through the type III secretion system ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) , we imaged and quantified the 128 subcellular co - localization of RipU K60 - GFP with either the actin reporter fABD2 - mCherry or the 129 microtubule reporter TUB5 - mCherry . RipU K60 and the fluorescent reporters were transiently 130 6 expressed in N . benthamiana leaves using Agrobacterium tumefaciens - mediated transient 131 transformation and imaged using SDCM at 48 - hours post - infiltration ( hpi ) . At 48 hpi , RipU K60 132 modestly ( Pearsons correlation coefficient ( Pcc ) = 0 . 3 ) but significantly co - localized with 133 fABD2 - mCherry and prominently ( Pcc = 0 . 6 ) with TUB5 - mCherry ( Figure 1 ) . Another Rs K60 134 T3E , RipBD - GFP , that localizes to the plasma membrane serves as a negative control for these 135 experiments and did not demonstrate significant ( Pcc values < 0 . 15 ) co - localization with 136 microtubules or actin filaments ( Figure 1 ) . Thus , RipU K60 co - localizes with both actin and 137 tubulin in N . benthamiana epidermal cells . 138 139 RipU K60 physically associates with actin and tubulin 140 The observation that RipU K60 co - localized with both actin and microtubule reporters suggested 141 that this T3E protein may physically interact with the components of the plant cytoskeleton . To 142 investigate whether RipU K60 associates with actin and tubulin , we transiently expressed RipU K60 - 143 GFP and performed coimmunoprecipitation ( co - IP ) assays . Both actin and tubulin were detected 144 in the RipU K60 - GFP immunoprecipitates ( Figure 2 ) . As a control , we transiently expressed free 145 GFP , which did not immunoprecipitate actin or tubulin ( Figure 2 ) . These data suggest that 146 RipU K60 physically associates with components of the plant cytoskeleton . 147 148 RipU K60 suppresses cell surface - triggered immune responses but not programmed cell death 149 Having shown that RipU K60 localizes to and physically associates with components of the plant 150 cytoskeleton , we next sought to gain insight into the putative function of this effector by testing 151 whether RipU K60 could suppress reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and callose 152 deposition mediated by flagellin22 ( flg22 ) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Transient expression 153 of RipU K60 - GFP in N . benthamiana leaves consistently suppressed flg22 - mediated ROS 154 production when compared to the empty vector control ( Figure 3A ) . We next investigated 155 whether RipU K60 could suppress callose deposition . We generated stable transgenic Arabidopsis 156 lines that express HA - tagged RipU K60 under the control of a dexamethasone - inducible promoter 157 ( pDEX - RipU K60 - HA ) . Given that Rs is a root invading pathogen , we examined the impact of 158 RipU K60 protein expression on flg22 Pa - elicited callose production in root tissues . Qualitative 159 7 analysis showed that RipU K60 expression suppressed flg22 Pa - induced callose deposition in 160 transgenic Arabidopsis roots ( Figure 3B ) . 161 In addition to suppressing flg22 Pa - mediated cell surface - triggered immune responses , several Rs 162 T3Es suppress hypersensitive response ( HR ) - like cell death [ 18 , 48 ] . Hence , we investigated 163 whether RipU K60 could suppress defense - related cell death triggered by the mammalian pro - 164 apoptotic protein Bcl - 2 associated X protein ( BAX ) . To this end , we transiently expressed 165 RipU K60 - GFP in N . benthamiana and , twenty - four hours later , agroinfiltrated BAX and assessed 166 cell death suppression . Intriguingly , RipU K60 - GFP was unable to suppress BAX - mediated cell 167 death , suggesting that this effector is not likely to function as a general suppressor of cell death 168 ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . 169 170 RipU K60 contributes to pathogenesis and virulence 171 Given our findings that RipU K60 contributes to host immune suppression we hypothesized that 172 RipU K60 is required for Rs K60 virulence and pathogenicity . To test this , we generated a 173 ∆ ripU K60 single mutant and ∆ ripU miniTn 7 : : ripU K60 ( hereafter ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 ) , the 174 complemented Rs K60 strain . We first compared colonization rates of wild - type Rs K60 , the 175 ∆ ripU K60 single mutant , and the ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 complemented strain in resistant and 176 susceptible tomatoes . We inoculated three Solanum lycopersicum tomato varieties : wilt - resistant 177 Hawaii7996 ( H7996 ) , wilt - susceptible L390 , and moderately wilt - susceptible Moneymaker 178 ( MM ) via soil drench inoculation [ 20 , 49 ] . Alhough H7996 is wilt - resistant , Ralstonia is still able 179 to colonize this variety , albeit at lower levels than wilt - susceptible plants [ 49 , 50 ] . Rs K60 180 colonization in roots was quantified at 24 , 48 and 72 hours post infiltration ( hpi ) . In all tomato 181 varieties , the ∆ ripU K60 single mutant had significantly lower rates of colonization when 182 compared to both wild - type Rs K60 and ∆ ripU : : RipU K60 at all time points ( ~ 10 4 CFU / g root 183 tissue compared to ~ 10 7 CFU / g root tissue for wild type or complemented strain , Figure 4A ) . 184 Colonization rates of ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 mimicked those of WT Rs K60 and were not 185 significantly different at any time point in any tomato variety ( Figure 4A ) . These data indicate 186 that a functional RipU K60 is required for full Rs K60 virulence in tomato roots . 187 188 8 Since the absence of RipU K60 influenced the ability of Rs K60 to colonize tomato roots , we next 189 asked whether RipU K60 was required for Rs K60 pathogenicity . Wilt - resistant H7996 and wilt - 190 susceptible MM and L390 plants were inoculated with either Rs K60 , ∆ ripU K60 , or 191 ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 . Wilting was assayed on a scale of 0 to 4 ( no discernable wilting = 0 and 192 100 % of leaves wilted = 4 ) . As expected , wilt - resistant H7996 plants inoculated with wild - type 193 Rs K60 , ∆ ripU K60 , or ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 did not display any observable wilting symptoms ( score 194 of 0 at 12 dpi ; Figure 4B ) . Wilt - susceptible L390 plants inoculated with the ∆ ripU K60 mutant 195 displayed fewer wilting symptoms ( wilting score of 2 . 59 at 12 days post inoculation ( dpi ) ) than 196 L390 plants inoculated with wild - type Rs K60 or ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 ( score of 3 . 77 and 3 . 79 at 197 12 dpi , respectively ; Figure 4B ) . Similarly , wilt - susceptible MM plants inoculated with the 198 ∆ ripU K60 mutant displayed fewer wilting symptoms ( score of 1 . 67 at 12 dpi ; Figure 5B ) than 199 MM plants inoculated with wild - type Rs K60 or ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 ( score = 2 . 71 , and 2 . 67 , 200 respectively ; Figure 4B ) . Additionally , the ∆ ripU K60 mutant had delayed virulence on susceptible 201 tomato plants . 202 203 Analysis of disease incidence ( number of plants with any symptoms / number of total plants ) 204 showed that the disease incidence of both wilt - susceptible genotypes L390 and MM was lower 205 when inoculated with the ∆ ripU K60 mutant compared to either wild type Rs K60 or the 206 complemented Rs strain ( Figure 4C ) . L390 plants treated with Rs K60 or the complemented 207 ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 reached 100 % disease incidence ( 27 / 27 plants ) at 6 days after inoculation . In 208 contrast , the highest disease incidence for L390 plants treated with the ∆ ripU K60 mutant was 209 81 . 4 % ( 22 / 27 plants ) at 8 dpi ( Figure 4C ) . MM plants inoculated with any strain reached their 210 highest disease incidence at 7 dpi . However , 85 % ( 23 / 27 ) of MM treated with Rs K60 and 81 . 4 % 211 ( 22 / 27 ) of MM plants inoculated with the complemented strain showed wilting symptoms . In 212 contrast , only 55 . 5 % ( 15 / 27 ) of MM plants inoculated with the ∆ ripU K60 mutant had wilting 213 symptoms ( Figure 4C ) . These findings , taken together with data from the root colonization 214 assays , demonstrate that RipU K60 is essential for full pathogenicity and virulence of Rs K60 . 215 216 Chemical disruption of the actin or microtubule cytoskeletons improves Rs K60 colonization 217 Our data indicated that RipU K60 is required for virulence and pathogenicity of Rs K60 , and that 218 this effector associates with both actin and microtubules . In addition to these findings , a meta - 219 9 analysis of three RNAseq datasets from resistant and susceptible tomatoes infected with 220 Ralstonia revealed that genes involved in cytoskeletal organization were enriched among 221 downregulated genes in susceptible tomatoes , but not in resistant plants [ 51 ] ( Supplemental 222 Figure 3 ) . Further , pharmacological disruption of the actin or microtubule cytoskeleton can 223 increase bacterial colonization in other Arabidopsis - P . syringae interactions ( Henty - Ridilla et al . 224 2013 , Kang et al . 2014 ) . Thus , we hypothesized that chemical disruption of the cytoskeleton 225 would promote Rs K60 colonization . To test this , we treated roots of tomato seedlings with 226 pharmacological inhibitors that disrupt microtubules or actin and inoculated with Rs K60 . 227 Latrunculin B ( LatB ) inhibits actin polymerization by binding to monomeric actin and 228 preventing its assembly into filament ends [ 52 ] . Oryzalin promotes the depolymerization of 229 microtubules [ 53 ] . Prior to Rs K60 inoculation , wilt - resistant and susceptible tomato seedling 230 roots were pre - treated with 10 µM LatB , 100 µM oryzalin , or mock treatment solution ( DMSO ) 231 for two hours . Roots were subsequently inoculated with Rs or water . Wilt - resistant Hawaii7996 232 ( H7996 ) and wilt - susceptible Moneymaker ( MM ) plants pre - treated with LatB showed 233 significantly increased Rs K60 colonization at 24 , 48 , and 72 hpi when compared to roots pre - 234 treated with mock solution ( Figure 5A ) . Thus , these data suggest actin disruption promoted Rs 235 K60 colonization in both wilt - resistant and wilt - susceptible roots . 236 237 Similar to LatB , wilt - resistant H7996 pre - treated with oryzalin showed significantly increased Rs 238 K60 colonization at 24 , 48 , and 72 hpi compared to roots pre - treated with mock solution ( Figure 239 5B ) . In wilt - susceptible MM pre - treated with oryzalin , colonization of Rs K60 was significantly 240 increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , pharmacological disruption of the actin or 241 microtubule cytoskeleton promoted Rs K60 colonization in both wilt - resistant H7996 and wilt - 242 susceptible MM roots . 243 244 RipU K60 alters actin and microtubule organization 245 Given our findings that disruption of the cytoskeleton influences the ability of Rs K60 to 246 colonize tomato roots , and that RipU K60 associates with the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton , 247 we hypothesized that RipU K60 alters cytoskeleton organization to influence virulence . To 248 investigate this hypothesis , we quantified actin and microtubule organization after transient 249 expression of RipU K60 or RipBD K60 [ 19 ] . N . benthamiana leaves were co - infiltrated with A . 250 10 tumefaciens strains transformed with either fABD2 - mCherry or TUB5 - mCherry , RipU K60 - GFP 251 or RipBD K60 - GFP and single frame images collected from epidermal cells at 2 different 252 timepoints with SDCM . Actin array organization was quantitatively assessed from images using 253 parameters of percentage of occupancy or density as well as the Coefficient of Variation ( CV ) 254 that describes the extent of filament bundling [ 54 , 55 ] . Transient expression of RipU K60 - GFP did 255 not significantly influence actin filament density or bundling compared to N . benthamiana leaves 256 transiently expressing RipBD K60 - GFP at 24 hpi . However , at 48 hpi actin filament density 257 significantly increased while the extent of bundling significantly decreased in RipU K60 - GFP 258 treatments compared to the RipBD K60 - control ( Figure 6 ) . Furthermore , N . benthamiana leaves 259 transiently expressing RipU K60 - GFP had significantly decreased microtubule density at 48 hpi 260 ( Figure 6C ) . Collectively , our results demonstrate that expression of RipU K60 disrupts 261 cytoskeletal organization in N . benthamiana . 262 263 Cytoskeletal disruption restores Rs K60 ∆ ripU K60 colonization 264 Having demonstrated that RipU K60 alters cytoskeleton organization and that cytoskeleton 265 disruption improves Rs K60 colonization , we reasoned that pharmacological disruption of the 266 cytoskeleton would restore the colonization ability of the ∆ ripU K60 mutant . To test this 267 hypothesis , tomato seedlings grown on agar plates were pre - treated with 10 µM LatB , 100 µM 268 oryzalin , or mock treatment solution for two hours until the treatment had soaked into the root 269 and surrounding media . Roots were subsequently inoculated with either wild - type Rs K60 or the 270 ∆ ripU K60 mutant . Rs colonization within the root tissue was examined at 24 , 48 , and 72 hpi . 271 Inoculation with the ∆ ripU K60 mutant showed significantly reduced colonization in mock treated 272 wilt - resistant H7996 and wilt - susceptible MM tomato roots at all three timepoints compared to 273 wild - type Rs K60 ( Figure 7 ) . Significantly , there was no statistical difference in colonization 274 patterns between tomato roots inoculated with Rs K60 or treated with a pharmacological 275 cytoskeletal disruptor and then inoculated with ∆ ripU K60 ( Figure 7 ) . This finding was consistent 276 across all three timepoints and both tomato genotypes . Our data thus support the conclusion that 277 pharmacological disruption of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton rescues the ∆ ripU K60 278 colonization defect . 279 280 Discussion 281 11 Here we show that a T3E protein from Rs K60 prominently colocalizes with microtubules , 282 modestly colocalizes with actin filaments , physically associates with actin and tubulin , is 283 required for bacterial virulence and colonization , and alters cytoskeleton organization in 284 heterologous expression systems . We also show that an intact cytoskeleton functions in tomato 285 immunity to Rs , as pharmacological disruption of either actin filaments or microtubules 286 promotes Rs colonization in tomato roots . Further , we demonstrate that RipU is required for 287 cytoskeleton - dependent proliferation within host plant tissues . Collectively , our data suggest that 288 Rs K60 uses the T3E RipU K60 to promote its virulence in planta via an association with 289 components of the cytoskeleton , likely interfering with cytoskeleton dynamics . We hypothesize 290 that the changes in cytoskeleton organization and dynamics inhibit immune signaling , further 291 enabling Rs virulence . 292 293 Dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements are a critical part of plant responses to microbes 294 Athough the cytoskeleton has been previously implicated in defense against other bacterial and 295 fungal pathogens [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 41 ] , our results represent significant advances in understanding the 296 contributions of the host cytoskeleton in the tomato - Rs pathosystem . Actin remodeling is a 297 broadly conserved plant immune response to cell surface - immune triggering microbes including 298 the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae , P . phaseolica , A . tumefaciens , and the fungal pathogen 299 Magnaporthe grisae [ 29 ] . For example , after inoculation with P . syringae pv tomato DC3000 a 300 biphasic actin remodeling response is observed in which an initial increase in actin filament 301 abundance occurs at 9 hpi , followed by enhanced bundling at 20 – 24 hpi [ 29 ] . Using different P . 302 syringae strains and mutants , the initial response was found to be part of PTI and could be 303 recapitulated with PAMPs , whereas the later response required the TTSS and effector proteins 304 [ 29 ] . An increase in actin filament density is also observed in hypocotyl epidermal cells upon 305 recognition of the immunogenic peptide elf26 [ 37 , 56 ] . Further , co - infiltration of Arabidopsis 306 leaves with the actin polymerization inhibitor LatB and P . syringae pv tomato DC3000 leads to 307 increased bacterial growth in leaves [ 29 , 30 ] . 308 309 One of the best characterized actin remodeling events is the focal response to leaf penetration by 310 fungi and oomycetes , in which cortical actin arrays are reorganized into a focal actin patch and 311 radial bundles that are focused beneath the fungal contact site [ 32 , 33 , 35 , 42 , 57 ] . The 312 12 reorganization of actin is accompanied by an increase in endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi 313 bodies [ 32 , 42 ] . Actin - dependent transport enables polarized transport and secretion of cell wall 314 and antimicrobial compounds directly to the infection site , resulting in cell wall barriers that 315 slow pathogen invasion as well as a localized defense response [ 34 , 37 , 42 , 58 – 61 ] . In response to 316 the powdery mildew pathogen Blumeria graminis f . sp . hordei ( Bgh ) , the increased density of 317 actin filaments at the infection site resembles an actin patch and precedes radial bundle 318 accumulation [ 35 ] . Formation of the actin patch requires the actin nucleator proteins ARP2 / 3 and 319 the class I formin AtFH1 . The actin focal response is required to prevent fungal leaf penetration , 320 as inhibiting actin rearrangements genetically or pharmacologically promotes pathogen 321 penetration into host cells [ 35 , 62 – 65 ] 322 323 Although actin remodeling is part of innate immune signaling [ 29 , 36 , 37 , 56 ] , the role of 324 microtubules in innate immunity is less clear . This is partly because a range of microtubule 325 organization changes are elicited by microbes and the types of changes depend on the genotype 326 of both the plant and pathogen [ 41 ] . Arabidopsis susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungal 327 pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was correlated with the ability of cortical microtubules to 328 reorganize after infection [ 66 ] . Concentrations of microtubules form beneath fungal appressoria 329 in barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) to prevent leaf penetration of Blumeria graminis f . sp . hordei 330 [ 67 , 68 ] but also in flax mesophyll cells in response to an incompatible strain of the rust fungus 331 Melamspora lini [ 69 ] . In contrast , microtubules reorient or depolymerize in resistant soybean 332 cultivars in response to the oomycete Phytophthora sojae [ 70 ] . Chemical disruption of 333 microtubules with oryzalin induces expression of defense genes in grapevine [ 71 ] and promotes 334 susceptibility to virulent bacteria [ 31 , 46 ] . Microtubule reorganization can be important for fungal 335 colonization , as inhibiting microtubule reorganization promotes penetration of non - host 336 Blumeria in barley [ 63 ] . Unlike actin , changes in microtubule organization in Arabidopsis have 337 not been observed in response to pathogenic bacteria or MAMPs [ 31 , 46 ] , but have been observed 338 in cells from other plant species such as Vitis rupestris ( grapevine ) cells [ 72 ] . While MAMP - 339 elicited changes to microtubule dynamics remain poorly understood , changes in microtubule 340 organization have been observed in response to other virulence factors such as microbe - produced 341 toxins and proteins [ 73 – 75 ] and in response to beneficial microbes [ 76 ] . For example , high 342 concentrations of Verticillium dahliae toxin ( VD toxin ) disrupt microtubules and reduce 343 13 microtubule density in Arabidopsis [ 74 , 75 ] . The limited knowledge regarding the role of 344 microtubules in immunity coupled with the complexity of these findings represent a significant 345 knowledge gap that has yet to be addressed in cytoskeletal response to cell surface - immune 346 signaling . 347 348 What is the function of the RipU K60 induced cytoskeletal changes ? 349 Transient expression of RipU K60 in N . benthamiana increased actin filament density and 350 decreased bundling at 48 h following agroinfiltration . By preventing proper cytoskeleton 351 remodeling , RipU K60 could repress cytoskeletal - mediated processes required for immune 352 signaling , including immune receptor endocytosis and secretion of anti - microbial compounds , 353 thereby enabling Rs colonization . 354 Cytoskeleton disruption may also indirectly promote Rs growth by enabling RipU K60 to gain 355 better access to the vasculature . The microtubule cytoskeleton plays an important role in 356 secondary cell wall formation in the xylem [ 77 , 78 ] . Trafficking of cellulose synthase complexes 357 ( CSCs ) along cortical microtubules enables placement of cellulose in xylem cell walls [ 79 – 81 ] . 358 As the xylem develops and undergoes programmed cell death , cell walls thicken and lignify . The 359 denser , lignified cell walls pose a challenge for pathogen entry and are protective for the plant . 360 Notably , not all areas of the xylem cell wall are lignified . Vascular pathogens like Rs can spread 361 among xylem cells in part through pits which form between xylem cells [ 82 ] . Local 362 depolymerization of microtubules prevents CSCs from moving to the region , thereby inhibiting 363 secondary cell wall thickening [ 81 , 83 ] . By promoting the depolymerization of microtubules , 364 RipU K60 may alter secondary cell wall structure , decreasing lignification and potentially 365 increasing pit formation , thus enabling Rs more rapid entry into the vasculature . 366 Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the interaction between RipU K60 and the cytoskeleton 367 We have shown that RipU K60 co - localizes and physically associates with components of the 368 cytoskeleton . However , our data does not rule out that such association is direct or mediated by 369 interactions with cytoskeleton associated proteins . Given that RipU K60 influences actin dynamics 370 and microtubule number , RipU K60 may interact with components required for cytoskeleton 371 remodeling , such as actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) and microtubule associated proteins ( MAPs ) , 372 or it may alter second messenger production ( e . g . ROS , Ca 2 + , or phospholipids ) that modulate 373 14 cytoskeletal dynamics . Alternatively , RipU K60 could interfere with actin - microtubule crosstalk by 374 associating with proteins that interact with both actin and microtubules [ 84 ] . The HopG1 effector 375 from P . syringae triggers the actin reorganization observed during ETS [ 43 ] and interacts with a 376 kinesin , a microtubule - associated motor protein . HopG1 co - immunoprecipitates with actin when 377 kinesin is present but not when expressed alone [ 43 ] . Although the major function of kinesins is 378 to move vesicles directionally along microtubules , these motor proteins can also cross - link actin 379 to microtubules [ 85 ] . A kinesin mutant has reduced susceptibility to Pst , suggesting that HopG1 380 targets kinesin to promote actin changes that enhance pathogen virulence [ 43 ] . If RipU K60 381 interferes with actin - microtubule crosstalk , this may simultaneously alter both components of the 382 cytoskeleton , actin immune signaling as well as downstream cell wall assembly resulting from 383 microtubule disruption . 384 385 RipU K60 is unusual among T3Es that impact the cytoskeleton 386 The cytoskeleton acts as a critical signaling intermediate during immune signaling , promotes 387 immune receptor endocytosis and placement on the plasma membrane , and functions as a 388 scaffold for vesicle trafficking and antimicrobial peptide transport [ 4 , 5 , 7 ] . Given its central role 389 in immunity , it is perhaps unsurprising that microbial pathogens have evolved effector proteins 390 that target and suppress cytoskeletal functions . Although multiple T3Es interact with the 391 cytoskeleton , they do not alter its organization in the same way . For example , Xanthomonas 392 campestris XopR directly interacts with the actin nucleating protein formin and promotes actin 393 nucleation during early stages of infection . High concentrations of XopR inhibit nucleation and 394 cause formin aggregation [ 39 ] , although the relationship among XopR , the cytoskeleton , and 395 symptom development is not clear . Pst DC3000 HopG1 induces actin bundling and decreases 396 actin filament density in Arabidopsis cotyledons [ 43 ] . HopG1 does not impact Pst DC3000 397 growth in Arabidopsis but promotes symptom ( chlorosis ) development . The chlorosis induced by 398 Pst DC3000 appears to be linked to changes in actin organization . Inoculating plants with 399 DC3000 and inhibiting actin polymerization with cytochalasin D led to enhanced chlorosis , 400 while promoting actin polymerization with jasplakinolide inhibited symptom development [ 43 ] . 401 HopW1 from Pst co - immunoprecipitates with Arabidopsis Actin7 and , in contrast to RipU K60 , 402 reduces actin filament density when expressed in N . benthamiana or Arabidopsis at 6 , 24 and 48 403 hpi [ 30 ] . HopW1 disrupts endocytosis during early infection in Arabidopsis [ 30 ] and may impact 404 15 recycling of immune - related proteins at the cell surface . An effector with similarity to HopW1 , 405 the Acidovorax citrulli effector AopW1 group I , also disrupts the actin cytoskeleton , although the 406 underlying mechanism is not completely understood [ 86 ] . 407 408 Additional effectors target microtubules or microtubule - related proteins . HopZ1a , a T3E from 409 Pst binds and acetylates tubulin [ 31 ] . Expression of HopZ1a causes a significant decrease in the 410 density of microtubule networks in Arabidopsis , disrupts the plant secretory pathway , and 411 suppresses callose formation [ 31 ] . Whether HopZ1a impacts the actin cytoskeleton is not known . 412 HopE1 interacts with MAP65 - 1 in a calmodulin - dependent manner [ 46 ] . Binding of HopE1 from 413 Pst DC3000 to calmodulin leads to the disassociation of MAP65 - 1 from microtubules but does 414 not appear to impact the organization of microtubules . AvrBsT acetylates Arabidopsis ACIP1 , 415 which positively regulates immune responses and co - localizes with microtubules . Acetylation of 416 AtACIP1 by AvrBsT changes this co - localization and promotes the aggregation of large 417 AtACIP1 puncta throughout the cell . Whether microtubule localization is required for the 418 immune - related function of AtACIP1 remains unclear . 419 420 To the best of our knowledge , only the T3E protein RipU K60 has been shown to physically 421 associate with both actin and microtubules . However , several lines of evidence suggest that other 422 effectors may also interfere with multiple structures of the plant cytoskeleton . Transient 423 expression of XopL from X . euvesicatoria causes cell death in N . benthamiama and decreases 424 microtubule number in N . benthamiama epidermal cells [ 45 ] . Co - localization of XopL with 425 microtubules is correlated with the cell death phenotype , as XopL truncations that did not 426 strongly co - localize with microtubules also did not cause cell death [ 45 ] . As discussed above , 427 HopG1 alters actin organization but interacts with a microtubule motor protein . Although the 428 impact of HopG1 expression on microtubule organization was not tested , these data suggest that 429 interactions between actin and microtubules are important for host immune responses and 430 suggest that proteins that interact with both actin and microtubules are possible targets for 431 effector proteins . 432 433 Conclusions 434 16 Effector proteins are often functionally redundant and / or work cooperatively to target common 435 functions in host cells [ 1 , 18 ] . Targeting the cytoskeleton may serve not only as a platform for 436 interfering with multiple plant functions but may provide a way for effector proteins to interact 437 synergistically and gain additional functionality . Given the close relationship of the cortical 438 cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane and cell wall [ 87 ] , as well as the localization of many 439 Rips to the cell periphery [ 19 ] , we speculate that RipU K60 may function with other Rips to 440 modulate immune processes at the cell periphery . For example , since microtubules influence 441 cellulose alignment , one can hypothesize RipU functioning with another effector to alter 442 cellulose synthase complex placement and cell wall structure . Alternatively , since actin promotes 443 plasma membrane nanodomain formation [ 88 ] , RipU K60 could function alongside other Rips to 444 change the placement of immune receptors on the plasma membrane . 445 446 Together our data suggest that by preventing proper cytoskeleton remodeling , RipU K60 represses 447 cytoskeletal - mediated processes required for immune signaling , thereby enabling Rs 448 colonization . The discovery of a T3E that targets multiple components of the cytoskeleton 449 underscores the importance of this proteinaceous network for immunity . The molecular 450 mechanisms through which RipU K60 alters the cytoskeleton and the specific impacts of RipU K60 - 451 induced cytoskeletal disruptions ( for example changes to PRR endocytosis ) remain unknown but 452 will be the subject of future investigation . 453 454 Methods 455 Plasmid construction 456 Full - length RipU K60 was PCR - amplified from Rs K60 genomic DNA and the resulting PCR 457 products were cloned into either pENTR / D - TOPO or pBSDONR P1 - P4 [ 89 , 90 ] Gateway donor 458 plasmids using BP Clonase II ( Invitrogen ) . We designated the resulting clones pENTR / D - TOPO - 459 RipU K60 and pBSDONR ( P1 - P4 ) - RipU K60 . 460 461 To generate the Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) - tagged RipU K60 construct , the pENTR / D - 462 TOPO - RipU K60 plasmid was mixed with the Gateway - compatible destination plasmid 463 pB7FWG2 , which places the transgene under the control of the 35S promoter [ 91 ] . Plasmids 464 17 were recombined by addition of LR Clonase II ( Invitrogen ) following the manufactures 465 instructions . The resulting expression clone was designated pB7FWG2 - RipU K60 - GFP . 466 467 To generate the pBAV154 : RipU K60 - 3xHA expression construct , the pBSDONR ( P1 - P4 ) - RipU K60 468 plasmid was mixed with pBSDONR ( P4r - P2 ) : 3xHA [ 89 ] and the Gateway - compatible 469 destination plasmid , pBAV154 , which places the transgene under the control of dexamethasone - 470 inducible promoter [ 92 ] . The plasmids were recombined using LR Clonase II ( Invitrogen ) 471 following the manufactures instructions . The resulting construct , pBAV154 : RipU K60 - 3xHA , was 472 used to generate transgenic Arabidopsis . 473 474 The pB7FWG2 : RipU K60 and pBAV154 : RipU K60 - 3xHA constructs were sequence - verified and 475 subsequently mobilized into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 ( pMP90 ) . 476 477 Agar plate - based plant growth conditions 478 Resistant tomato accession Hawaii7996 ( H7996 ; Solanum lycopersicum ) , susceptible 479 MoneyMaker ( MM ; S . lycopersicum ) and susceptible L390 ( S . lycopersicum var . cerasiforme ) 480 seeds were surface sterilized with a 50 % bleach solution for 5 minutes , washed with water and 481 stratified at 4°C overnight . Seeds were then planted on water - agar and grown at 28°C (cid:3) to 30°C 482 in a growth chamber at 16h : 8h day / night cycle . 483 484 Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) Columbia - 0 ( Col - 0 ) plants were surface sterilized using 50 % 485 bleach and 70 % ethanol and were plated on 0 . 5x Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) media containing 486 nitrogen ( Caisson Labs , UT , USA ) . Media was supplemented with various treatment solutions 487 according to experiment . Seeds were stratified on treatment plates for 48 hours in the dark . Plates 488 were then moved to a growth chamber at 22°C at 16h : 8h day / night cycle . 489 490 491 Soil - based plant growth conditions 492 Sterilized and stratified tomato seeds were planted in Pro - Mix PGX Propagation soil ( Premier 493 Tech Horticulture ) in 3603 pots containing 25 - 27g of soil . Plants were grown under 16h : 8h 494 18 day / night cycle , at 28°C (cid:3) to 30°C in a growth chamber for 15 days prior to inoculation with 495 Ralstonia . At 10 days post planting , tomato seedlings were fertilized with Peters Fertilizer 496 ( Hummert International , USA ) . 497 Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana tabacum seeds were sown in pots containing Pro - Mix 498 PGX Propagation soil ( Premier Tech Horticulture ) and grown for 4 to 5 weeks in a growth 499 chamber at 60 % relative humidity in a 16 - h - : 8 - h day / night cycle at 22°C to 23°C . 500 501 Secretion assay 502 The secretion assays were performed as in [ 93 ] . The pAM5 plasmid ( a gift from Stephane Genin ) 503 was electroporated into both Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum strain GMI1000 ( Rp GMI ) and 504 ∆ hrcC GMI mutant strains carrying RipU K60 - 3HA fusion . The ∆ hrcC GMI mutant strain lacks a 505 functional type III secretion system and is unable to secrete T3Es . The plasmid pAM5 , which 506 increases HrpB expression and allows for better detection of the effector in the culture 507 supernatant , was electroporated into transformed Rp GMI or the ∆ hrcC GMI mutant . Transformed 508 Rp GMI and the ∆ hrcC GMI mutant were cultured overnight at 28°C and pellets were resuspended in 509 secretion media . After an 8h incubation at 28°C , samples were diluted with the secretion medium 510 to ensure equal optical density ( O . D . ) readings ( O . D . 600 0 . 5 - 0 . 8 ) . The supernatant and the pellet 511 were then separated via centrifugation . Bacterial pellets were resuspended in sterile water and 512 stored at - 20°C . Supernatant samples were filtered , 1 mL of cold 25 % trichloroacetic acid was 513 added and incubated overnight at 4°C . For supernatant samples , the pellets were washed with 1 514 mL acetone 90 % , the pellets dried , and stored at - 20°C . 515 516 Generation of transgenic Arabidopsis 517 The pBAV154 : RipU K60 - 3xHA construct was transformed into wild - type Arabidopsis Col - 0 using 518 the floral dip method [ 94 ] . Progeny were selected for resistance to glufosinate in the T1 and T2 519 generations , and PCR amplification confirmed the presence of RipU K60 transgene . 520 521 Agrobacterium - mediated transient expression in Nicotiana species 522 19 The pB7FWG2 - RipU K60 - GFP construct was transformed into A . tumefaciens GV3101 ( pMP90 ) 523 and streaked onto Luria - Bertani ( LB ) media supplemented with 25 μ g gentamicin sulfate and 524 100 μ g spectinomycin . Cultures were prepared in liquid LB , with the appropriate antibiotics , and 525 grown overnight at 30 ° C . Following overnight incubation , cells were pelleted by centrifugation 526 at 3 , 000 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature and resuspended in 10 mM MgCl 2 . Bacterial 527 suspensions were diluted to an optical density at 600nm ( OD 600 ) of 0 . 5 , incubated in 150 μ M 528 acetosyringone for 3 - 4 hours at room temperature , and infiltrated into four - week Nicotiana 529 benthamiana or N . tabacum . For co - infiltration experiments , A . tumefaciens strain GV3101 530 harboring 35 S : : fABD2 - mCherry or UBQ10 : : TUB5 - mCherry constructs were co - infiltrated into 531 N . benthamiana with RipU K60 - GFP or RipBD K60 - GFP . Infiltrated leaves were imaged at 24 and 532 48 hpi . 533 534 Cytoskeleton imaging and quantitative image analysis 535 N . benthamiana leaf epidermal cells co - expressing cytoskeletal markers and Rs T3Es were 536 imaged by spinning disc confocal microscopy SDCM with an Olympus IX - 83 inverted 537 microscope equipped with a spinning disc confocal head ( Yokagawa CSU - X1 - A1 ; Hamamatsu 538 Photonics , Hamamatsu , Japan ) and an Andor iXon Ultra 897BV EMCCD camera ( Andor 539 Technology , Concord , MA , USA ) . Images were collected with an Olympus 60x oil objective 540 ( 1 . 40 NA UPlanSApo ; Olympus ) using MetaMorph version 7 . 10 . 5 software . GFP and mCherry 541 fluorescence were excited with 488 - nm and 561 - nm lasers and emission collected through 542 525 / 30 - nm and 607 / 36 - nm filters , respectively . Confocal z - series were taken at 0 . 5 μ m step size 543 for a total of 30 steps . For GFP and mCherry double - channel imaging , cells expressing single 544 markers were checked to make sure no fluorescence bleed - through was detected in each channel . 545 At least 5 - 10 images were taken at each infiltration site , and at least three infiltration sites were 546 imaged for each treatment . 547 All image processing and analysis were performed in ImageJ or FIJI [ 95 ] . Epidermal cell z - series 548 were converted into single images by maximum intensity projection before quantitative analysis . 549 For colocalization analysis of RipU K60 - GFP with actin or microtubule filaments , intracellular 550 regions co - expressing both markers were cropped in both channels and used as Region of 551 20 Interests ( ROIs ) for Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis . The analysis was performed with 552 the ImageJ plug - in JaCoP [ 96 ] . Cells co - expressing RipBD K60 - GFP and actin or microtubule 553 markers were analyzed in the same experiments as control for random colocalization . 554 Actin density was analyzed as percentage of occupancy as previously described [ 29 ] . Actin 555 extent of bundling was analyzed by quantifying the coefficient of variation ( CV ) of intensity 556 values with an ImageJ macro developed by [ 55 ] . Microtubule density was estimated by counting 557 microtubule numbers along a 10 µm line drawn vertically to the orientation of the most 558 microtubules in a cell as previously described [ 97 ] . For all quantitative analysis , 5 - 15 cells were 559 measured at each infiltration site and at least three infiltration sites were measured in each 560 biological repeat . 561 562 Luminol - based assay for quantification of Reactive Oxygen Species production in Nicotiana 563 benthamiana leaves 564 This assay was performed as described previously [ 19 , 51 ] . N . benthamiana leaves infiltrated 565 with A . tumefaciens were harvested at two days post infiltration . A 5 mm biopsy punch was used 566 to generate leaf discs ( four leaf discs per plant ; 12 leaf discs in total for each construct ) . Discs 567 were washed in water and kept in the dark for two hours , with water changes every 30 minutes . 568 After two hours , leaf discs were transferred to a 96 - well Perkin Elmer OptiPlate and stored 569 overnight in water in the dark . The following day , leaf discs were treated with horseradish 570 peroxidase and luminol solution , and a flagellin22 ( flg22 ) peptide elicitor was added to induce 571 ROS production . Three independent experimental replicates were performed . Area Under the 572 Curve was calculated for each and compared using a Student T - Test in R version 3 . 6 . 1 . 573 574 Cell death suppression assay 575 Three - week - old N . benthamiana leaves were agroinfiltrated with A . tumefaciens GV3101 576 carrying pB7FWG2 - RipU K60 - GFP at an OD 600 of 0 . 5 , and infiltration sites were marked with a 577 red permanent marker . Twenty - four hours post agroinfiltration ( hpi ) , an overlapping region 578 within the same N . benthamiana leaves were agroinfiltrated with A . tumefaciens GV3101 579 carrying the cell death elicitor , BAX , at an OD 600 of 0 . 1 , and the infiltrated regions were marked 580 21 with a red permanent marker . Leaves were assessed for cell death five days after agroinfiltration 581 with BAX and a representative leaf was photographed under white light . 582 Callose deposition assay in Arabidopsis roots 583 The callose deposition assay was adapted from [ 98 ] . Wild type Columbia - 0 ( Col - 0 ) and 584 transgenic Arabidopsis plants with DEX - inducible RipU K60 expression were stratified for 48 585 hours and germinated on 0 . 5x MS media supplemented with 0 . 5 % sucrose for seven days . 586 Seedlings were then moved to 6 - well tissue culture plates with liquid 0 . 5x MS ( with sucrose ) 587 supplemented with pre - treatment solutions ; DMSO , 10 µM DEX . Plants were grown in pre - 588 treatment liquid media for three days , and media was replaced daily . Seedlings were then 589 challenged with flagellin - 22 ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) or a mock treatment solution for 24 590 hours . After MAMP treatment , seedlings were destained then transferred to a 0 . 01 % aniline blue 591 staining solution for two hours . Seedlings were plated in glycerol and imaged using a Zeiss 880 592 LSM Upright Confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss Micrscopy , White Plains , NY ) . Callose was 593 imaged using the DAPI filter ( 358 nm excitation , 463 nm emission ) . 594 Rs recombinant DNA techniques 595 A clean deletion mutant Δ ripU K60 was created using sacB counter - selection with the vector 596 pK18mobsacB as previously described [ 99 ] . Briefly , the upstream ( 646 bp ) and downstream 597 ( 536 bp ) regions of ripU were amplified from Rs K60 gDNA using Q5 high fidelity DNA 598 polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA , USA ) with the primers ripU up F / R and ripU 599 dw F / R ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . Upstream and downstream fragments were fused and cloned at 600 the HindIII site into pK18mobsacB by Gibson Assembly ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA , 601 USA ) following the manufacturer’s recommendations . pK18mobsacB Δ ripU construct was 602 inserted into K60 using electroporation as previously described [ 100 ] . 603 The first genomic recombination event was selected on CPG + Km . The second recombination 604 event was screened for sucrose and Km sensitivity on CPG + 10 % sucrose . Successful deletion 605 of ripU ( Δ 659 bp ) was confirmed using PCR with primers ripU flank F / R ( Supplemental Table 606 1 ) . Genomic DNA was isolated using Genomic DNA Buffer Set with Genomic - tip 20 / G 607 ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . 608 22 To construct the complementation vector , the gene region including the native promoter ( 405 bp 609 upstream ) and terminator ( 269 bp downstream ) was polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) – amplified 610 from K60 gDNA and cloned via Gibson Assembly ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA , USA ) 611 at the HindIII site of pUC18miniTn7Gm to create pUC18miniTn7Gm : : ripU K60 , following the 612 manufacturer’s protocol . K60 Δ ripU was transformed with pUC18miniTn7Gm : : ripU K60 and 613 pTNS3 to promote transposition and single gene insertion . 614 615 Soil Drench Inoculation 616 Wild type Rs K60 , the ∆ ripU K60 mutant , and the ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 complementation mutant 617 were grown for two days on Casamino Peptone Agar ( CPG ) containing 1 % triphenyl tetrazolium 618 chloride ( TZC ) at 28 ◦ C . Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in sterile water to 10 8 619 CFU / mL . Tomato plants were inoculated at the three - leaf stage by applying inoculum ( wild - type 620 Rs K60 , ∆ ripU K60 , and ∆ ripU K60 : : RipU K60 ) or water ( mock treatment ) directly to the soil using a 621 serological pipette ( 1mL of inoculum / 1 mg of soil ) as described in Meline et al . 2022 . 622 623 Root colonization and disease index 624 To measure Rs K60 colonization , roots from inoculated tomato plants were harvested at 24 , 48 625 and 72 hours post inoculation . Within treatments , harvested roots were pooled in groups of three 626 and weighed after the removal of residual soil and water . The surface of these pooled roots was 627 then sterilized . Root samples were ground with a mortar and pestle and resuspended with 1 mL 628 of sterile water . This root tissue slurry was used to plate serial dilutions on CPG + 1 % TZC to 629 measure the colony forming units ( CFUs ) of Rs K60 present per gram of root tissue . These 630 dilution plates were incubated at 28°C for 48 hours . To determine the pathogen titer , colonies 631 were counted on the dilution plates and set relative to the mass of the original root tissue . 632 Experiments were repeated in triplicate , with each experiment containing three biological 633 samples per treatment , per time point . Data did not meet the assumption of normality ; the Dunn 634 Test was performed in RStudio version 3 . 6 . 1 . 635 636 Inoculated tomato plants were scored daily for wilting severity to assess bacterial wilt disease 637 index . Wilting symptoms were quantified on a scale from 0 to 4 ( 0 = no leaves with observable 638 wilting , 4 = 100 % of leaves wilting ) . Using these raw wilt scores , disease index was calculated 639 23 using the following equation ( (cid:0)(cid:2) = Disease Index , (cid:3) (cid:0) = number of leaves wilted , (cid:3) = total 640 number of leaves ) . 641 (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:0) (cid:3) (cid:6)4(cid:8) Experiments were replicated four times and each experiment consisted of eight to nine biological 642 replicates . 643 644 Cytoskeleton disruption and colonization assays 645 Tomato seedlings were grown on water agar and treated with either 10 μ M latrunculin B ( LatB ) 646 solution , 100 μ M oryzalin solution , or mock treatment solution ( 0 . 5X MS + DMSO ) two hours 647 prior to inoculation with Rs . Rs was inoculated by pipetting 200 µl inoculum onto the entire root . 648 Treatments were allowed to dry in a sterile hood . Rs K60 , ∆ ripU K60 inoculum ( 1x10 5 CFU / ml ) or 649 a mock treatment ( water ) was then applied to root tips . There were six treatments for these 650 experiments ; Rs K60 , Rs K60 + LatB , Rs K60 + oryzalin , ∆ ripU K60 , ∆ ripU K60 + LatB and 651 ∆ ripU K60 + oryzalin . Colonization assays were performed on inoculated roots . Colonization 652 experiments were performed in triplicate , and each experiment consisted of three biological 653 samples . Data were analyzed in R ( version 3 . 6 . 1 ) using the Wilcox test . 654 Co - immunoprecipitation assay 655 Co - immunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) were conducted on protein extracted from Nicotiana 656 benthamiana leaves expressing the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) epitope tagged proteins as 657 described previously [ 101 ] with slight modifications . Briefly , three leaves were harvested and 658 pooled at 48hpi and preserved with liquid nitrogen . Leaf tissues were ground in 1mL of ice cold 659 IP buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM 660 EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % plant protease inhibitor cocktail , and 1 % 2 , 2’ - 661 dipyridyl disulfide ) using a cold ceramic mortar pestle and were centrifuged at 10 , 000 x g for 15 662 minutes at 4°C . The supernatant was incubated with 10µL of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - 663 Trap A ( Chromotek ) bead slurry for 4 hours at 4°C with constant slow rotation followed by 664 washing the bead slurry 5 times with 500µL IP wash buffer at 1 , 000 x g for 1 minute at 4°C . The 665 beads were resuspended in IP buffer and combined with 4x Laemmli buffer ( BioRad ) 666 supplemented with 10 % β - mercaptoethanol and the mixtures were boiled at 95°C for 10 min . 20 667 24 µl of input and 5 µl of IP samples were loaded and protein samples were separated on 4 - 20 % 668 Tris - glycine polyacrylamide gels ( Bio - Rad ) at 170 V for 1 hour in 1X Tris / glycine / SDS running 669 buffer . Total proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( GE Water and Process 670 Technologies ) at 100 V for one hour . Membranes were incubated with blocking buffer ( 1X Tris - 671 buffered saline ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl [ pH 6 . 8 ] ) solution containing 0 . 1 % Tween20 672 ( TBST ) containing 5 % Difco skim milk ) for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking . 673 Proteins were subsequently detected with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated anti - GFP 674 antibody ( 1 : 5 , 000 ) ( Miltenyi Biotec # 130 - 091 - 833 ) , anti - plant actin mouse monoclonal antibody 675 ( 3T3 ) - HRP ( Abbkine # A01050HRP ) , alpha Tubulin monoclonal primary antibody 676 ( YL1 / 2 ) ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Thermo Scientific MA1 - 80017 ) and goat anti - rat IgG secondary antibody 677 ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Thermo Scientific PA1 - 84709 ) in blocking buffer . Following antibody incubation , 678 membranes were washed at least three times for 10 minutes with 1x TBST solution followed by 679 5 minutes incubation at room temperature with either Clarity Western ECL ( BioRad ) . 680 Immunoblots were developed using an Amersham ImageQuant 500 CCD imaging system 681 ( Cytiva ) . The experiment was repeated three times with similar results . 682 Acknowledgements 683 This work was funded by a Foundation for Food and Agriculture ( FFAR ) New Innovator Award 684 to AIP and the EMBRIO institute , contract # 2120200 , a National Science Foundation ( NSF ) 685 Biology Integration Institute ( CS and AIP ) .
