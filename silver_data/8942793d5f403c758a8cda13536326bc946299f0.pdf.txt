ABSTRACT Objectives School closures have been used as a core non - pharmaceutical intervention ( NPI ) during the COVID - 19 pandemic . This review aims at identifying SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in educational settings during the first waves of the pandemic . Methods This literature review assessed studies published between December 2019 and 1 April 2021 in Medline and Embase , which included studies that assessed educational settings from approximately January 2020 to January 2021 . The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC framework ( P - Population , C - Concept , C - Context ) . The study Population was restricted to people 1 – 17 years old ( excluding neonatal transmission ) , the Concept was to assess child - to - child and child - to - adult transmission , while the Context was to assess specifically educational setting transmission . Results Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria , ranging from daycare centres to high schools and summer camps , while eight studies assessed the re - opening of schools in the 2020 – 2021 school year . In principle , although there is sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in school settings , the SAR remain relatively low—when NPI measures are implemented in parallel . Moreover , although the evidence was limited , there was an indication that younger children may have a lower SAR than adolescents . Conclusions Transmission in educational settings in 2020 was minimal—when NPI measures were implemented in parallel . However , with an upsurge of cases related to variants of concern , continuous surveillance and assessment of the evidence is warranted to ensure the maximum protection of the health of students and the educational workforce , while also minimising the numerous negative impacts that school closures may have on children . INTRODUCTION One of the more perplexing and controver - sial dimensions during the first year of the COVID - 19 pandemic surrounded the role of children in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Epidemiological indicators of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children provide a complex picture regarding their potential role in the transmission chain . Systematic reviews have concluded that children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 1 2 However , when infected and symptomatic , children may shed viral RNA in similar quantities to adults , 3 and younger children ( under 5 years ) with mild - to - moderate symptoms may shed even more virus than older children and adults . 4 While the proportion of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infections among children in the general population is uncertain , initial data had indi - cated that 16 % of paediatric cases in Europe in the first phase of the pandemic were clas - sified as asymptomatic , 5 while up to 90 % of paediatric cases in China were deemed to be asymptomatic , mild or moderate . 6 More - over , it is possible that children are less often asymptomatic carriers than adults : a study of non - COVID - 19 - related hospitalisations in Milan identified 1 % of children and 9 % of adults as asymptomatic carriers of SARS - CoV - 2 . 7 While children have been noted to have lower rates of severe COVID - 19 cases , 8 9 there was during 2020 evidence of differing transmission dynamics between younger and older children . 2 T Index casesunder approx - imately 10 years of age were reported to lead to lower secondary attack rates ( SAR ) than older children and adults , 10 11 although more recently , due to a combination of differential vaccination coverage rates across age groups as well as circulation of the more transmis - sible Omicron variant of concern , it is unclear if such an association still holds . 12 Important potential sources of evidence surrounding the role of children in the COVID - 19 pandemic come from studies Strengths and limitations of this study ► This review followed a systematic search approach . ► The included studies of this review have heteroge - nous methodologies and a meta - analysis could not be performed . ► The search represents peer - reviewed literature that included previous SARS - CoV - 2 variants but does not cover the Delta or Omicron variants . 2 Vardavas C , et al . BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e058308 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 058308 Open access situated in the community , household , healthcare or educational settings . Transmission of SARS - COV - 2 has thus far been documented to be higher in household settings than in other community settings—including schools—a finding which may be potentially attributable to the individual , behavioural and contextual factors of households versus other settings , as has been suggested elsewhere . 10 Although at the time of writing the more transmis - sible Delta and Omicron variants are driving SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , there is currently a gap in published studies looking at the transmission of COVID - 19 during the first waves in school settings . However , as ensuring high levels of preparedness in school settings should remain a priority , 13 the literature published thus far may have important insights to guide decision - making around school closures and re - openings , as well support decision - making for mitigation measures in educational settings . With the above in mind , this literature review was conducted to assess child - to - child and child - to - adult SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within educational settings during the first wave of the pandemic and to calculate where possible the SAR when the child is the index case . METHODSSearch strategy This literature review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analysis ( PRISMA ) guidelines . 14 Relevant studies published between December 2019 and 1 April 2021 were identified by searching Medline and Embase . The following set of inclusion criteria were used to deter - mine eligibility of the studies , which is based on the PCC framework ( P - Population , C - Concept , C - Context ) . The study Population was restricted to people aged 1 – 17 years ( excluding neonatal transmission 15 ) , the Concept was to assess child - to - child and child - to - adult transmission when the child is the index case , while the Context was to assess specifically educational setting transmission clusters . Subject heading terms and free text words relating to the Population , Concept and Context terms as identified in the inclusion criteria were used to develop a comprehen - sive list of terms for the search strategy ( so as to ensure we would not loose information ) , from which this specific review on educational settings was based . We included all studies of quantitative research , while , opinion pieces , commentaries , case reports and editorials were excluded . Mathematical modelling and simulation studies were also excluded . We additionally screened reference lists of the included articles to identify further relevant studies . The search was limited to the English language . The search terms of the review are presented in the online supple - mental file . Study selection Initially , a pilot training screening process was used where 100 identical articles were screened for their eligibility independently by two reviewers to ensure consistency in screening . As a high measure of inter - rater agreement was achieved between the two reviewers during the pilot assessment ( percentage agreement > 90 % and / or Cohen’s kappa > 0 . 81 ) , the remaining titles were randomly allo - cated to the two reviewers and screened for eligibility independently by them . After an initial selection of the titles , each reviewer assessed each other’s selected studies . The retrieved articles were then independently double - screened by two reviewers based on the full text of the articles . Data extraction The data extraction template was piloted independently by the two reviewers on a random sample of two included studies to enable an assessment of consistency in data extraction and to identify where amendments needed to be made to the template . The remaining studies were then data extracted independently by two reviewers , and the results were double - checked across the original manuscript by a third reviewer . Data synthesis Characteristics of the included studies were presented in tabulated form detailing the study design , geograph - ical location of the study , sample size , characteristics of the populations considered , setting , context , parallel implemented non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPI ) and the findings of the study . Depending on the level of information available , infection SAR were noted as defined in each included study . A narrative synthesis approach was applied to look systematically at the data and to describe each study categorised by the study design . Patterns in the data were identified through tabulation of results , and an inductive approach was taken to translate the data to identify areas of common - ality between studies . Patient and public involvement statement Patients or the public were not involved in the design , or conduct , or reporting , or dissemination plans of our research . RESULTSStudy selection and description A total of 5406 studies were identified according to the specified selection criteria from Medline and Embase . After the removal of duplicates , 5233 were screened by title / abstract , out of which 333 were assessed via full text and 15 studies subsequently included in this review . The PRISMA flow chart showing the flow of study selection is presented in figure 1 . Fifteen published studies were identified to report child - to - child and / or child - to - adult transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Timeframes of data collection within these 3 Vardavas C , et al . BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e058308 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 058308 Open access studies ranged between January 2020 and January 2021 . Studies from 11 countries were included ( USA , South Korea , Israel , Germany , Italy , Ireland , France , Singapore , Australia , Norway and England ) . A full detailed overview of the published studies is provided in table 1 . Studies assessing outbreaks in educational settings Heavey et al 16 conducted a case study in order to explore the role of transmission among children in the school setting in Ireland , before school closure . Three paedi - atric index cases of COVID - 19 with a history of school attendance were detected with 895 contacts . Child - to - adult transmission or child - to - child transmission was not reported in this study . Similarly , Danis et al 17 presented the contact tracing results of a 9 - year - old child in France , who visited three different schools the first days of symptom appearance . There was no evidence of secondary trans - mission in any of the school contacts . Moreover , Yung et al traced three COVID - 19 cases ( two paediatric and one adult ) in three different educational settings , and the results were negative , as were the tracing of close contacts of a preschool case in South Korea . 18 Gold et al in early 2020 had also indicated the possibility of educators playing a role in school transmission as identified through the assessment of transmission clusters in primary ( elemen - tary ) schools in Georgia , USA . More specific , in four clusters the index case was an educator , while a student was the index case in one cluster . 19 Lopez et al assessed three COVID - 19 outbreaks in child care facilities in Utah , during 1 April – 10 July 2020 and noted that SARS - CoV - 2 infections among young children acquired in child care settings were transmitted to their household members . 20 One study from New South Wales , Australia presented an overview of COVID - 19 cases and transmission in schools . In a total number of 15 schools and 10 early childhood educational and care settings , 27 index cases were identified , among which 12 were children and 15 staff members . Secondary transmission was noted in only 4 of 25 educational settings . 21 Studies assessing the re - opening of schools and summer camps Eight studies reported on the regional evidence after the re - opening of schools . A school outbreak in Israel after re - opening of schools in May 2020 was described by Stein - Zamir et al . The outbreak assessment was initiated by two paediatric COVID - 19 cases that were not epidemiologi - cally related . The results showed that 153 / 1161 students and 25 / 151 staff members tested positive for COVID - 19 . 22 A study by Link - Gelles et al , in Rhode Island , USA , among 666 child care programmes revealed 52 confirmed and probable cases ( 33 confirmed cases ) , of which 30 were among children and 22 among adults . Secondary trans - mission for 10 cases was noted in only 4 / 666 childcare programmes . 23 The regional re - opening of schools in Germany in May 2020 was assessed by Ehrhardt et al , who noted that child - to - child transmission in schools / childcare facilities appeared very uncommon , with an estimated 6 of the identified 137 cases that had attended school to have led to a secondary transmission overall to 11 additional pupils . 24 While two additional studies from South Korea by Yoon et al indicated that on the return of children to school in May – June 2020 , no indi - cation of secondary transmission was noted in kinder - garten children , middle school or high schools , while in primary school only two cases of secondary transmission was noted . 25 26 The re - opening of schools in September 2020 in Italy was not associated with elevated SAR , which reached 3 . 8 % overall , 0 % in preschool , 0 . 38 % in primary and 6 . 46 % in secondary schools , however these percent - ages included both adult and child cases . 27 Brandal et al assessed the transmission of COVID - 19 in school settings in Norway between August and November 2020 and iden - tified minimal child - to - child ( 0 . 9 % , 2 / 234 ) and child - to - adult ( 1 . 7 % , 1 / 58 ) transmission . 28 Summer educational camps are presented separately , as close proximity between students is noted within school hours and throughout the day and night due to additional extra curricular activities and close sleeping proximities . Two studies assessed secondary transmission within summer educational camps , with striking differ - ences . Pray et al identified a rapid transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 at an overnight retreat where adolescents and young adults aged 14 – 24 years had prolonged contact and shared sleeping quarters , where one index case / child led to the infection of 76 % of attendees . 29 On the contrary , Blaisdell et al in four overnight camps noted no Figure 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analysis flow chart of study selection included in the rapid review . 4 Vardavas C , et al .

BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e058308 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 058308 Open access indication of secondary transmission following the isola - tion of the paediatric index case and quarantine of their cohort , indicating the importance of the implementation of NPIs to reduce COVID - 19 transmission . 30 Secondary attack rates of COVID - 19 transmission in educational settings Table 2 presents the SAR extracted from the studies , ranging from 0 % to 76 % , depending on the setting , the timeframe and the implementation of NPIs . With the exception of the study by Pray et al , 29 within the context of summer camps in which a high transmission rate ( 76 % ) was noted , in all studies within the context of school settings , the reported SARs were minimal . Age differen - tiations were noted , for instance , in the study by Larosa et al , across 36 schools in northern Italy , who identified an overall SAR of 3 . 2 % , reaching 6 . 6 % in middle and high schools and 0 . 38 % in primary schools . 27 DISCUSSION This study provides a rapid review of the peer - reviewed literature pertaining to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission by children within educational settings , a topic which is a crucial input to assessments of the role of school settings in COVID - 19 transmission . The literature appraised in this review provides sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in school settings , however the reported SARs were often relatively low within the studies assessed by our review , reflecting - primarily SARS - CoV - 2 transmission during 2020 . Our results with regard to educational settings are in line with population - based studies published after the cut - off of this review , in which SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks were reported to be uncommon in educational settings 31 in England , 32 Canada 33 and in Utah , USA , 34 Missouri , USA , 35 New Jersey , USA 36 and North Carolina , USA 37 during similar periods . During the first waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the vast uncertainty surrounding the epidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 led many countries globally to include school closures concomitant with other NPIs for reducing COVID - 19 transmission . Within our review , there were limited cases in the assessed studies in which a child index case was responsible for extensive secondary transmission in schools , with the notable exception of an outbreak in Israel ( which was associated with dense spacing , lack of the use of facemasks and closed spaces with poor ventilation ) and secondary transmission within summer educational camps , where prolonged exposure between case - contact pairs was likely . 29 The latter finding is supported by data from a large population - based study assessing transmis - sion dynamics that identified that patterns of enhanced transmission risk in similar age pairs were strongest among children aged 0 – 14 years . 2 Among studies that note a very small number of cases after school re - opening , 38 39 authors attribute this to the strict implementation of NPIs , including the use of S t u d y C o un t r y T i m e f r a m e A g e r a n g e * S e tt i n g N o . o f s y m p t o m a t i c p ae d i a t r i c i n d e x ca s e s N o . o f a s y m p t o m a t i c p ae d i a t r i c i n d e x ca s e s S ec o n d a r y ca s e s i n t h e s c h oo l s e tt i n g s † P a r a ll e l n o n - p h a r m ace u t i ca l i n t e r v e n t i o n s i n t h e c o mm un i t y s e tt i n g B l a i s d e ll e t a l 30 U SA , M a i n e J un e – A u g u s t 2020 7 – 18 4 o v e r n i g h t ca m p s 0 1 N o s ec o n d a r y t r a n s m i ss i o n i d e n t i fi e d P r e - a rr i v a l q u a r a n t i n e , p r e - a rr i v a l a n d p o s t - a rr i v a l t e s t i n g a n d sy m p t o m s c r ee n i n g , c o h o r t i n g , u s e o f f ace c o v e r i n g s , p h ys i ca l d i s t a n c i n g , e nh a n ce d h y g i e n e m ea s u r e s , c l ea n i n g a n d d i s i n f ec t i n g a n d m a x i m a l o u t d oo r p r og r a mm i n g . * E x ce p t w h e n t h e a g e r e f e r s t o o n l y o n e p ae d i a t r i c c a s e a n d a g e r a n g e i s n / a . † M ea s u r e d f r o m t h e d a t e o f l a s t c o n t ac t . ‡ P r o b a b l e ca s e s . n / a , n o t a v a il a b l e .

Within this context , age is noted to be a crucial aspect , as modelling studies from the Netherlands indicated that contact restrictions within the age group of 10 – 20 years caused a slightly more significant reduction in Re , the effective reproduc - tion number , compared with age group of 5 – 10 years . 47 Another European study that assessed school closure , based on the population of two large cities of Norway , Oslo and Tromsø , indicated that a controlled and gradual school re - opening would only have a slight increase in the reproduction number of < 0 . 25 , and probably in the range between 0 . 10 and 0 . 14 , which would not substantially affect the infection rates . 48 55 Modelling studies assessing school closures have chal - lenges in disentangling the impacts of school closures from other related NPI measures , notably workplace closures and remote - work policies 49 . A rapid review conducted by Viner et al , 50 underlined that while modelling studies support the closure of educational institutions as part of the social distancing measures that need to be imple - mented , the only study examining school closures exclu - sively found relatively marginal impact , by reasonably assuming increased levels of household and community transmission as a result . However , a review that included only empirical studies , conducted by Mendez - Brito et al , 51 indicated that school closures , followed by workplace and entertainment venue closures and bans of public events , were the most effective NPIs , concluding that an early response and a combination of specific social distancing measures are of crucial importance for the reduction of COVID - 19 cases and deaths . While school closures may reduce SARS - CoV - 2 trans - mission , the societal and economic impacts of prolonged school closure are noteworthy , as they may impact the availability of the healthcare workforce 42 52 and may Table 2 Studies that assessed the secondary attack rate ( SAR ) * , when children are the index case within educational settings Study Country Timeframe SAR Heavey et al 16 Ireland March 2020 0 Danis et al 17 France January – February 2020 School : 0 / 86 , community : 0 / 80 , hospitalised : 1 / 6 Yung et al 62 Singapore February – March 2020 0 / 42 Macartney et al 21 Australia , New South Wales 25 January – 9 April 2020 All settings , all child case to child contacts 0 . 3 % ( 2 / 649 ) All settings , all child case to staff member contacts 1 . 0 % ( 1 / 103 ) , Child close contacts 28 . 0 % ( 7 / 25 ) Stein - Zamir et al 22 Israel May 2020 178 / 1312 Heavey et al 16 USA , Rhode Island 1 June – 31 July 2020 n / a Pray et al 29 USA , Wisconsin July – August 2020 115 / 151 ( 76 % ) Blaisdell et al 30 USA , Maine June – August 2020 0 Lopez et al 20 USA , Utah April – July 2020 n / a Ehrhardt et al 24 Germany , Baden - Württemberg 25 May – 5 August 2020 Estimation of one secondary case per roughly 25 infectious school days Brandal et al 28 Norway , Oslo and Viken counties 28 August – 11 November 2020 Child 2 / 234 ( 0 . 9 % ) , adult 1 / 58 ( 1 . 7 % ) Gold et al 19 USA , Georgia 1 December 2020 – 22 January 2021 n / a Larosa et al 27 Italy 1 September – 15 October 2020 38 / 994 ( 3 . 82 % ) overall 0 . 38 % in primary schools ( 1 / 266 ) 6 . 46 % in secondary schools ( 37 / 572 ) Yoon et al 26 South Korea 27 February – 16 March 2020 0 Yoon et al 25 Korea Up to 31 July 2020 2 / ≥13 100 * The extracted SAR based on the original definition given by the authors in each study . n / a , not available . 8 Vardavas C , et al .

As we assessed peer - reviewed evidence published in two biomedical databases , it inherently reflects the status quo of the interim of the previous school years ( January 2020 – January 2021 ) due to the lag time between study implementation , peer review and publication . A further limitation of this report refers to the fact that these studies represent child - to - child transmission within the context of previous SARS - CoV - 2 strains and are not directly appli - cable to newer and more transmissible variants , such as the SARS - CoV - 2 Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) variant of concern or the more recent Omicron variant . Finally , the included studies reflect a broad geographical and temporal range and are limited in comparability due to varying factors such as : background levels of community SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ; enrolment strategies and varying NPI poli - cies which in turn depends highly on the geographical region and the socioeconomic context , while account - ability to government and political stability were found to exert influence . 48 Hence in light of the above , supporting educators and parents in the implementation of NPIs is important as population - based studies have indicated that adults concerned about the impact of COVID - 19 on their children’s education were more likely to practice personal protective measures and social distancing . 59 CONCLUSIONS The findings presented here provide an assessment of the published peer - reviewed evidence on transmission in educational settings during 2020 , in which transmission was minimal—when NPI measures were implemented in parallel . However , with an upsurge of cases related to new variants of concern , notably Delta and Omicron , continuous surveillance and assessment of the evidence is warranted to ensure the maximum protection of the health of students and the educational workforce , while also minimising the numerous negative impacts that school closures may have on children . Where or when schools remain open , in - school NPI measures should be continually refined according to new knowledge according to the epidemiological context , taking into account levels of community SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , information on the severity of circulating SARS - CoV - 2 variants , and vaccination coverage levels among eligible students , which includes children 5 and over in many jurisdictions . 60 61 Finally , future studies should focus more on identifying SARS - CoV - 2 variants and on providing specific definitions about cases and contacts , while more detailed information on the contact tracing strategies and the implemented NPIs would reduce the limitations .
