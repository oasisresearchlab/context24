This locally restricted Ca 2 + current forms the basis for fusion and ﬁssion events between endolysosomal membranes and thereby for intracellular trafﬁcking processes . Here , we study the function of TPC1 and TPC2 for uptake , recycling , and degradation of epidermal growth fac - tor receptor ( EGFR ) using a set of TPC knockout cells . RNA sequencing analysis revealed multiple changes in the expression levels of EGFR pathway - related genes in TPC1 - deﬁcient cells . We propose that a prolonged presence of activated EGFRs in endolysosomal signaling platforms , caused by genetic inactivation of TPCs , does not only affect EGFR signaling pathways but also increases de novo synthesis of EGFR . Increased basal phospho - c - Jun levels contribute to the high EGFR expression in TPC - deﬁcient cells . Our data point to a role of TPCs not only as important regulators for the EGFR transportation network but also for EGFR - signaling and expression . INTRODUCTION Two - pore channels ( TPCs ) comprise a small family of ion channels with only two representatives in rodents and humans , TPC1 and TPC2 . Structurally they are evolutionary intermediates between single - domain TRP and four - domain voltage - gated Na + or Ca 2 + channels ( Galione , 2019 ; Jentsch et al . , 2015 ; Patel , 2015 ) . TPCs are located in membranes of the endolysosomal system and are assumed to play a crucial role for intracellular trafﬁcking processes ( Grimm et al . , 2017 ; Marchant and Patel , 2015 ) . As acidic compartments of the endolysosomal system constitute small Ca 2 + stores , it can be assumed that TPCs form cytosolic Ca 2 + entry pathways , which allow for a transient and locally restricted increase of Ca 2 + . This elevation of Ca 2 + triggers fusion and ﬁssion events of endolysosomal membranes and thereby forms the basis for intracel - lular vesicle trafﬁcking and sorting processes during protein uptake , recycling , and degradation ( Grimm et al . , 2014 ; Sakurai et al . , 2015 ) . So far , the function of TPCs has mostly been investigated by targeted dele - tion of single TPC genes in mice . TPC functions have been described in the context of receptor endocy - tosis , degradation , and recycling ; of bacterial protein toxin uptake ; and of entry and processing of virus particles ( Castonguay et al . , 2017 ; Grimm et al . , 2014 ; Sakurai et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , all these models resulted in distinct phenotypes such as development of fatty liver disease in the case of LDL receptor regu - lation , an impairment of toxin uptake and severity of intoxication , and endolysosomal trapping of virus par - ticles and prevention of infection . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) belongs to the ErbB family of growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and is involved in key processes such as cell growth , differentiation , prolif - eration , and motility ( Ceresa and Peterson , 2014 ) . In many tumors EGFR is either upregulated or mutated and numerous recent therapeutic strategies aim at blocking oncogenic EGFR signaling ( Shan et al . , 2012 ; Tomas et al . , 2014 ) . EGFR signaling is initiated by ligand binding to receptors present at the cell surface , which triggers their dimerization and auto - phosphorylation . Activated receptors are internalized by cla - thrin - mediated ( CME ) or clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) ( reviewed in Bakker et al . , 2017 ) . Although ligand binding and initiation of signal transduction occurs at the cell surface , activated EGFR is located for the longest period within endolysosomal membranes where EGFR signaling is still ongoing ( Conte and Si - gismund , 2016 ; Sousa et al . , 2012 ; Vieira et al . , 1996 ) . The intracellular EGFR transportation network has 1 Institut fu¨r Experimentelle und Klinische Pharmakologie und Toxikologie , Fakulta¨t fu¨r Medizin , Albert - Ludwigs - Universita ¨ t Freiburg , Albertstr . 25 , 79104 Freiburg , Germany 2 Lead Contact * Correspondence : n . klugbauer @ pharmakol . uni - freiburg . de https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . isci . 2021 . 102099 iScience 24 , 102099 , February 19 , 2021 ª 2021 The Author ( s ) . This is an open access article under the CC BY - NC - ND license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by - nc - nd / 4 . 0 / ) . 1 ll OPEN ACCESS been well studied over the last decades , and it was shown that ligand concentrations determine the pref - erential trafﬁcking route of activated receptor ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . At low EGF concentrations , uptake of EGFRs primarily occurs by CME and EGFRs are transported via early and recycling endosomes back to the plasma membrane ( Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ) . At higher EGF concentrations , a saturation effect can be observed and increasing amounts of activated EGFRs are taken up by CIE and are routed via late endo - somes to lysosomes for degradation ( Bakker et al . , 2017 ) . In this context , earlier studies demonstrated a link between EGFR trafﬁcking and TPCs , because deletion of TPC2 causes an accumulation of EGFR in endo - lysosomal compartments ( Grimm et al . , 2014 ; Sakurai et al . , 2015 ) . Recent studies indicate that EGFR signaling occurs not only during surface localization ( Sousa et al . , 2012 ) but also after internalization of activated EGFR ( Conte and Sigismund , 2016 ) ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . For example , transcriptional activity of the ERK1 / 2 pathway is directly affected by the localization of EGFR in the endo - lysosomal system ( Sousa et al . , 2012 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , analysis of EGFR uptake and EGFR trafﬁcking allows one to uncover the potential roles of the endolysosomally localized TPCs within this transportation system . In this study , we took advantage of mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast ( MEF ) and HeLa cells with single TPC knockouts , and also of a TPC1 / 2 double knockout to explore its consequences on EGFR signaling . We identify TPCs not only as key regulators for intracellular EGFR trafﬁcking but also for controlling EGFR tran - scription and surface expression . RESULTS Fluorescence microscopy exempliﬁes an altered EGFR uptake and trafﬁcking in TPC - deﬁcient cells TPCs play a crucial role for intracellular trafﬁcking processes and affect receptor endocytosis , recycling , and degradation . In this study , we investigated the roles of TPCs for processing and signaling of the EGFR , a well - studied receptor for regulating cell growth not only under physiological but also under pathophysio - logical conditions . For this purpose , we used MEF cells derived from transgenic mouse lines with a targeted disruption of either TPC1 or TPC2 , the only two members of rodent and human TPC family ( Arndt et al . , 2014 ; Grimm et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , a TPC1 / 2 - double knockout MEF cell line was generated in this study by applying the CRISPR - Cas9 system as described in Supplemental information ( Figure S1 ) . Initial studies were performed to compare the uptake of EGFR in wild - type and TPC - deﬁcient MEF cells . Cells were incubated for 60 min with 200 ng / mL EGF labeled with Alexa 488 . This high concentration favors CIE of the EGF - EGFR complex and initiates trafﬁcking processes that are mainly linked to degradation routes ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . As a result , TPC - deﬁcient cells internalized higher amounts of labeled EGF than wild - type cells ( Figure 1 : top panel ) . In comparison with single knockouts , TPC1 / 2 double knock - outs demonstrated the highest accumulation of EGF . A Rab5 staining highlighting early endosomes did not indicate any differences in the distribution pattern of Rab5 - positive compartments in wild - type and knockout cells ( Figure 1 : middle panel ) . However , TPC2 and TPC1 / 2 double knockouts showed numerous examples of co - localization of Rab5 - and EGF - positive vesicles , whereas wild - type and TPC1 - deﬁcient MEF cells showed only a few ( Figure 1 : bottom panel and arrowheads in insets in C and D ) . A quantiﬁcation of the area covered by EGF / Rab5 - positive vesicles indicates signiﬁcant differences between those groups ( Fig - ure S2 ) . The values for wild - type and TPC1 - deﬁcient cells were 0 . 05 % G 0 . 02 % and 0 . 13 % G 0 . 05 % , respec - tively . For TPC2 and TPC1 / 2 double knockouts coverage values were 0 . 34 % G 0 . 07 % and 0 . 36 % G 0 . 11 % , respectively . These initial studies indicate that TPCs are involved in different ways in the uptake and intra - cellular trafﬁcking of the EGF - EGFR complex . Deletion of TPCs increases EGFR uptake A ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) - based method was applied to quantify the ﬁndings of the initial ﬂuorescence microscopic approach . MEF cells were incubated with high concentrations of EGF - Alexa488 for 10 to 120 min and were subjected to subsequent FACS analysis . The ﬂuorescence intensities correlated with the amount of incorporated EGF and were used to study the kinetics of EGF uptake and receptor trafﬁcking . All Alexa 488 ﬂuorescence histograms showed a rightward shift compared with un - treated controls ; this effect was strongest for TPC1 / 2 double knockouts ( Figures 2A – 2D ) . Interestingly , TPC2 - deﬁcient cells demonstrated the broadest signal distribution . The quantiﬁcation of the ﬂuorescence signal of all genotypes revealed a continuous increase of ﬂuorescence over the entire experimental period of 120 min and clearly indicated higher values for the knockouts , in particular for the TPC1 / 2 double knockout ( Figure 2E ) . The single MEF cell knockouts showed a 2 - to 3 - fold increase , and the double ll OPEN ACCESS 2 iScience 24 , 102099 , February 19 , 2021 iScience Article knockout showed a 4 - to 6 - fold increase over the entire experimental time frame . To generalize and to lay our conclusions on a broader basis we included wild - type and TPC1 - deﬁcient HeLa cells into our studies ( Castonguay et al . , 2017 ) . The FACS analysis was performed in the same way as for MEF cells , and ﬂuores - cence histograms again showed a rightward shift when the cells were treated with EGF - Alexa488 ( Figures 2F and 2G ) . The quantiﬁcation of the ﬂuorescence signals at 10 min , 30 min , and 60 min all resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in TPC1 - deﬁcient HeLa cells when compared with wild - type cells ( Figure 2H ) . In sum - mary , the FACS - based quantiﬁcation conﬁrmed the observations made in the ﬂuorescence microscopy studies and indicated a faster and appreciably higher uptake of EGF - Alexa488 in TPC - deﬁcient cell lines . To conﬁrm that the above - mentioned effects were indeed caused by deletion of TPCs , we performed rescue experiments . Thus , single TPC knockout MEF cells were transfected either with the corresponding TPC - EGFP - encoding vector or with an EGFP vector as control . After 24 h , cells were stimulated with EGF - TexasRed for 2 h and subjected to FACS analysis . Only cells positive for expression of EGFP constructs were included in the analysis . Both the TPC1 and the TPC2 rescue experiments conﬁrmed that the expression of corresponding TPC - EGFP vector recovered the wild - type phenotype of the MEF cells , i . e . , a reduced up - take of EGF - TexasRed ( Figure S3 ) . Lysosomal degradation does not contribute to observed TPC effects Next , we checked for a possible lysosomal degradation and stability of EGF - Alexa488 conjugate by per - forming pulse - chase studies . MEF cells of all genotypes were incubated with EGF - Alexa488 for 1 h at 4 (cid:1) C followed by a washing step to remove any unbound ﬂuorescence - labeled EGF . Afterward cells were incubated with non - labeled EGF at 37 (cid:1) C for 30 and 60 min . FACS analysis revealed no signiﬁcant differ - ences between the genotypes , when comparing ﬂuorescence intensities after 30 and 60 min with initial values ( Figure S4 ) .

During the entire experiment , labeled EGF either remained within cells or was bound to the cellular surface rendering the occurrence of putative exocytotic processes during previously performed EGF uptake studies unlikely . TPC - deﬁcient cells express higher amounts of surface - accessible EGFR Differences in EGFR endocytosis or degradation between wild - type and TPC - deﬁcient MEF cells may also be caused by an altered expression level or membrane distribution of the EGFR . Therefore , EGF - Alexa488 binding experiments and immunoblot - based analyses of EGFR amounts were performed . MEF cells of all genotypes were incubated for 60 min with 200 ng / mL EGF - Alexa488 at 4 (cid:1) C and were evaluated by FACS analysis . As a result , all cells demonstrated a signiﬁcant binding of labeled EGF ( Figures 3A – 3D ) . However , when comparing the different genotypes , we found an increased binding in the order wild - type , TPC1 - KO ( knockout ) , TPC2 - KO , TPC1 / 2 - doubleKO , highest for the double knockout ( Figure 3E ) . Additionally , cell ly - satesfromallMEFgenotypeswereanalyzedbywesternblotandquantiﬁedusingtubulinasloadingcontrol . The results from these experiments were completely in line with those from the binding studies and indi - cated the same order of EGFR expression ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Thus the total amount of EGFR ( western blot ) as well as surface - accessible EGFR ( binding studies ) was signiﬁcantly increased in TPC - deﬁcient MEF cells and was the highest in TPC1 / 2 - doubleKO . Additionally , we investigated EGFR expression in HeLa cells by immunoblot analysis ( Figure 4C ) . The results from these studies indicated roughly a doubling of the EGFR levels in TPC1 - deﬁcient HeLa cells and were in line with data from the MEF cells ( Figure 4D ) . EGFR degradation follows the same kinetics in wild - type and TPC - deﬁcient cells EGFR levels were investigated by means of western blot analysis in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( 10 m g / mL ) . This approach allows for a quantiﬁcation of EGFR levels only depend - ing on degradation , but not on de novo synthesis . Serum - starved MEF cells were exposed to 200 ng / mL EGF for up to 120 min , and EGFR levels were determined for each genotype . Control cells were stimulated with EGF in the absence of cycloheximide . As expected , initial EGFR levels varied between genotypes ( wild - type [ WT ] : 100 % G 19 % , TPC1 - KO : 455 % G 25 % , TPC2 - KO : 572 % G 21 % , TPC1 / 2 - KO : 549 % G 18 % ) and were normalized to the same starting value to facilitate comparison of degradation kinetics . There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in degradation kinetics between wild - type and TPC - deﬁ - cient MEF cells , indicating that the higher expression levels of EGFR in TPC - deﬁcient cells are not caused by an impaired degradation process ( Figure 5 ) . TPC - deﬁcient cells show higher recovery rates In the context of regenerative processes , two main routes , recycling of internalized receptor and de novo receptor synthesis , determine the amount of surface - accessible EGFR . To investigate the role of TPCs on these regenerative processes we established protocols that allowed quantifying EGFR surface expression and transcription levels . MEF cells were incubated with a high concentration of 200 ng / mL of non - labeled EGF at 4 (cid:1) C to saturate surface - expressed EGFR . After 1 h , non - labeled EGF was substituted by EGF - Alexa488 , and cells were incubated for 10 , 30 , and 60 min at 37 (cid:1) C . Additionally , to quantify the amount of surface - expressed EGFR at starting time , cells were kept at 4 (cid:1) C for an additional hour with EGF - Alexa488 . Quantiﬁcation of the initial level of surface EGFR was determined by incubation of MEF cells with EGF - Alexa488 alone . Cells of all genotypes were handled in parallel and were analyzed by FACS . The 1 - h receptor saturation with non - labeled EGF signiﬁcantly reduced the subsequent binding of Alexa 488 - labeled EGF to MEF cells in all genotypes . In contrast to wild - type cells , which showed a reduction of only 10 % , all TPC - deﬁcient cells demonstrated a much stronger drop down of ﬂuorescence intensity ( Figure 6A ) . Figure 2 .

( I ) Data table showing the calculated ﬂuorescence intensity values and p values . ll OPEN ACCESS iScience 24 , 102099 , February 19 , 2021 5 iScience Article During the following regeneration period from 10 to 60 min , MEF cells of all genotypes showed an increased binding of EGF - Alexa488 ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . Wild - type cells demonstrated only very moderate increases in ﬂuorescence , but reached higher values after 1 h compared with control cells ( cells incubated with labeled EGF only ) ( Figure 6B ) . All TPC - deﬁcient cells showed a faster regeneration of surface - acces - sible EGFR . This effect was dependent on the type of TPC knockout and was the highest for TPC1 / 2 - dou - bleKO ( Figure 6B ) . For wild - type cells , recovery time was approximately 30 min . TPC1 - deﬁcient cells did not reach initial levels even after a regeneration window of 60 min . TPC2 - and TPC1 / 2 - doubleKO cells only achieved about 60 % of recovery after 1 h when compared with starting levels . In view of the absolute amounts of surface - accessible EGFR , all TPC - deﬁcient cells recovered signiﬁcantly higher EGFR levels than wild - type cells . Egfr mRNA levels are increased in TPC - deﬁcient cells Thehighconcentrationof200ng / mL ofEGFfavorsthenon - canonicalendosomalandreceptordegradation route and points to a de novo receptor synthesis as the main mechanism for receptor recovery . Therefore , we analyzed Egfr transcript levels of all cells by real - time PCR ( qPCR ) . All TPC - deﬁcient cells demonstrated higher transcript levels compared with wild - type cells , in the same order as observed in previous experi - mentswithhighestvaluesforTPC1 / 2 - doubleKOshowinganabout12 - foldincrease ( FigureS5 ) . Thus , regen - eration and qPCR studies clearly indicate that de novo synthesis of EGFR in TPC - deﬁcient cells is the major mechanism responsible for the higher surface expression of EGFR . RNA sequencing analysis conﬁrms EGFR upregulation and highlights numerous transcriptional changes in EGFR - linked pathways in TPC1 - deﬁcient MEF cells The high expression of EGFR in TPC - deﬁcient MEF cells led us to investigate the consequences of a TPC1 deletion in EGFR - linked pathways . First , RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) coverage tracks for Egfr in wild - type compared with TPC1 knockout cells indicated a more than 3 - fold increase of Egfr transcripts in TPC1 - KO cells ( Figure S6A ) . These results correspond perfectly to our western blot , qPCR , and FACS data and further substantiates that TPC deﬁciency causes a strongly increased Egfr expression in MEF cells ( Figure S6B ) . Second , we took advantage of our RNA - seq data and studied the transcriptional changes of major Figure 3 .

Our analysis focused on pathways involved in cytoskeletal regulation , endocytosis , apoptosis , and protein synthesis and on expression of relevant transcription fac - tors ( Table S1 ) . To provide a comprehensive overview , RNA - seq data were transferred into a scheme high - lighting the changes of gene expression involved in EGFR pathways ( Figure 7 ) . It is evident from this scheme that deletion of TPC1 affects EGFR - dependent pathways in multiple ways . TPC - deﬁcient cells exhibit prolonged EGFR signaling Binding of EGF to EGFR results in receptor auto - phosphorylation and initiation of its kinase activity . In accordance with the high surface expression and regeneration of EGFR in MEF cells deﬁcient for TPCs , we investigated possible consequences for EGFR signaling . MEF cells of all genotypes were stimulated with 200 ng / mL EGF for 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 min and lysed and subjected to SDS - PAGE . Western blots were eval - uated for total amounts of ERK1 / 2 , for phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 ( pERK1 / 2 ) , and for tubulin . Initial ERK1 / 2 and pERK1 / 2 levels were determined initially in the absence of EGF . At the beginning of the experiment ( t = 0 ) pERK1 / 2 was hardly detectable in all probes ( Figure 8 and Table S2 ) . EGF stimulation resulted in a fast and transient ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation from the ﬁrst to the ﬁfth minute , which was comparable in wild - type and TPC - deﬁcient cells . However , differences emerged after 10 min demonstrating a drop of pERK1 / 2 compared with the initial levels in wild - type cells , whereas all TPC - deﬁcient cells still showed elevated pERK1 / 2 levels ( Figure 8 and Table S2 ) . As a control , basal ERK1 / 2 levels were measured for the entire experimental period . Values for ERK1 / 2 were stable , indicating that availability of non - phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 was constant for each time point . In summary , the data indicate that deletion of TPCs in MEF cells caused a prolonged activation of EGFR and ERK1 / 2 signaling . TPC - deﬁcient MEF cells demonstrate higher basal c - Jun phosphorylation levels than wild - type cells BasalexpressionofEGFRismainlyregulatedbytranscriptionfactorSP1 , whichistypicallypresentinthenucleus in constant amounts . However , several studies indicate that EGFR transcription is further regulated by MAP Figure 4 .

Therefore , we investigated phosphorylation of c - Jun in wild - type and TPC - deﬁcient cells under basal and EGF - stimulated conditions . Phospho - speciﬁc c - Junantibodies already indicated a strong phosphorylation of c - Jununder basal non - stimulated conditions in TPC1 - , TPC2 - , and TPC double knockout cells ( Figures 9A and 9B ) . These differ - ences were signiﬁcant between wild - type and each of the deletion mutants . Stimulation by EGF ( 200 ng / mL for 5 min ) causes higher phospho - c - Jun levels in all MEF cells , with wild - type phospho - c - Jun levels as high as in unstimulated TPC - deﬁcient cells ( Figure 9C ) . Thisresult clearly indicates that TPC - deﬁcient MEFcellsalready exhibit phospho - c - Jun levels that were achieved in wild - type cells only in the presence of EGF . DISCUSSION The intracellular trafﬁcking network of the EGFR has been subject of numerous studies , and its understanding is ofgreatvalueforestablishingnovelandinnovativeanti - tumormechanisms ( Sigismundetal . , 2018 ) .

Inourstudies , weusedhighconcentrationsofEGFfor receptor stimulation to achieve conditions that favor an uptake of EGFRs via CIE leading to lysosomal degrada - tion of most activated receptor proteins ( Caldieri et al . , 2017 ) . Owing to the preferred localizations of TPC1 in early and TPC2 in late endosomes and lysosomes ( Calcraft et al . , 2009 ; Castonguay et al . , 2017 ) , our single anddoubleTPC - KOapproachallowedustodiscriminatebetweenputativelydifferentrolesofTPCsintheseen - dolysosomal compartments . The initial ﬂuorescence microscopic studies—using Rab5 as a marker for early en - dosomes—demonstrated that TPC2 - and TPC1 / 2 - deﬁcient MEF cells contained numerous vesicles that were positive for EGF and Rab5 . In contrast , wild - type and TPC1 - deﬁcient cells showed much less co - localization of EGF and Rab5 . These observations indicate that EGFR trafﬁcking is delayed in TPC2 - deﬁcient cells . This may be caused by a longer retention time of the receptor in late endolysosomal compartments leading to a partial Figure 5 .

In previous studies of TPC2 - deﬁcient cells , Grimm and colleagues per - formed co - localization experiments with the lysosomal marker LAMP - 1 observing accumulation of EGFR in LAMP1 - positive vesicles ( Grimm et al . , 2014 ) . This also indicates a delay of receptor processing and trafﬁcking and is in line with observations made in our experiments . To gain additional insights into the time - dependent uptake of EGFRs , a FACS - based approach was cho - sen . Internalization of labeled EGF was quantiﬁed over an experimental window of 2 h . For each time point investigated , TPC1 and TPC2 single knockout cell lines demonstrated a 2 - to 3 - fold higher ﬂuorescence signal than wild - type cells . For the TPC1 / 2 - doubleKO the effect was additive and a 4 - to 6 - fold increase of EGF internalization was observed . These results are not limited to MEF cells and can be generalized due to our parallel studies with HeLa cells . Rescue experiments conﬁrmed that the phenotype was indeed caused by deletion of TPCs . Re - expression of TPCs in corresponding knockout cells recovered the wild - type phenotype . These observations are in accordance with studies focusing on other model substrates such as LDL to monitor uptake of LDL receptor in TPC2 - deﬁcient cells ( Grimm et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we add the ﬁnding that deletion of TPC1 also increases uptake of labeled substrate and that deletion of both channel subtypes causes an additive effect . We hypothesize that TPC1 and TPC2 meet spatial and / or timely diverse functions within the endolysosomal system . Having the speciﬁc distribution of the two TPC subtypes in mind ( Calcraft et al . , 2009 ; Castonguay et al . , 2017 ) it seems likely that TPC1 is more impor - tant for receptor trafﬁcking in early endosomes , whereas TPC2 contributes to transport processes from late endosomes to lysosomes .

So far , our studies investigated the consequences of TPC deletion for the uptake of activated EGFR , but did not consider possible differences in the level of surface - expressed EGFR . Therefore , we quantiﬁed the amount of surface - expressed EGFRs and total EGFRs in MEF cells by receptor binding experiments and western blot analysis . The results for both approaches were rather comparable with an about 3 - fold in - crease for TPC1 - deﬁcient cells , about 4 - fold increase for TPC2 - deﬁcient cells , and 5 - to 6 - fold increase for TPC1 / 2 - doubleKO cells . Again , these observations were not limited to MEF cells , but were also found in TPC1 - deﬁcient HeLa cells . An altered degradation route might be one reason for the observed differences in Egfr expression levels and pointed us to compare the degradation kinetics of all genotypes . However , in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor no differences could be observed between all MEF cell lines . Therefore , the next studies were designed to discriminate between the two major regenerative mechanisms of receptor availability , recycling , and de novo protein biosynthesis . Quantiﬁcation of surface - accessible EGFR was examined by binding of labeled EGF at low temperatures after saturation of receptors with non - labeled EGF . Regener - ation rates were measured for up to 60 min at 37 (cid:1) C . To provide a comprehensive discussion of these studies it is necessary to analyze both the relative changes and the absolute ﬂuorescence values . Wild - type cells had the capacity to reach the initial levels within 30 min , TPC1 - deﬁcient cells regenerated to about 80 % after 1 h , and TPC2 and TPC1 / 2 - doubleKO cells only achieved about 60 % of the starting level . However , when considering the absolute amounts of surface - accessible EGFR levels , regeneration rates of all TPC knockouts were much higher than wild - type rates . Measurement of egfr - transcript levels supported these Figure 9 .

RNA - seq analysis of Egfr transcripts from TPC1 - deﬁcient MEF cells also conﬁrmed above - mentioned expression data . Taken together , these results suggest that EGFR de novo synthesis is the main mechanism respon - sible for the elevated levels of surface - accessible EGFR . The strong increase of EGFR levels in TPC - deﬁcient cells may have distinct consequences on EGFR - depen - dent signaling pathways . To get a ﬁrst glimpse of changes in gene expression of EGFR pathway proteins following deletion of TPC1 , we performed a detailed RNA - seq analysis when compared with wild - type cells . These data indicated numerous quantitative changes in the gene expression levels of EGFR pathway - related proteins , whereby up - and downregulation was observed . As these results did not favor a single candidate that would explain high EGFR expression , we additionally investigated phosphorylation of selected target proteins . We analyzed ERK1 / 2 signaling by quantiﬁcation of phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 ( pERK1 / 2 ) in comparison in with total amounts of ERK1 / 2 . Stimulation with EGF resulted in a fast increase of pERK1 / 2 levels in cells of all ge - notypes . In TPC - deﬁcient cells ERK1 / 2 remained in the phosphorylated state for longer than 10 min . At this time , pERK1 / 2 levels already dropped down to initial non - stimulated levels in wild - type cells . These obser - vations lead to the conclusion that TPC - deﬁcient MEF cells exhibit prolonged EGFR signaling . Total amounts of non - phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 were unchanged throughout the entire experiment and were not different between the genotypes . Thus , massively increased EGFR expression in TPC - deﬁcient cells does not account for a stronger or faster activation of EGFR , suggesting that the lower levels of EGFR in wild - type cells are already sufﬁcient for maximal activation . A very similar effect was observed by means of a Ned - 19 block of TPCs , which signiﬁcantly increased and extended tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 ( Kilpatrick et al . , 2017 ) . Our studies indicate that deletion of TPCs does not only cause dysregulation of endolysosomal trafﬁcking but also affects transcription of the Egfr gene and EGFR signaling . Therefore , we propose a new model link - ingfunctionofTPCswithEGFRtrafﬁckingandsignaling ( Figure10 ) . BindingofEGFcausesauto - cross - phos - phorylation of the EGFR dimer and subsequent receptor activation . As of this time point , EGFR recruits downstream signaling complexes and triggers speciﬁc cellular signaling cascades . Noteworthy , EGFR signaling is ongoing as long as the receptor kinase domain is accessible from the cytosolic side ( Conte and Sigismund , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Comparable mechanisms have been reported for numerous other receptors that use endolysosomal compartments as major signaling platforms ( Murphy et al . , 2009 ) . During maturation from early to late endosomes , EGFR is internalized in multivesicular bodies and receptor signaling is terminated . Ultimately , receptor and ligand degradation occurs in lysosomes . In this context , deletionofTPCscausesadelayofendolysosomalEGFRtrafﬁckingandtherebyaprolongedEGFRsignaling and continuous activation of associated signaling pathways . Exactly that was observed for phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 : pERK1 / 2 levels remained unchanged in TPC - deleted MEF cells for longer than 10 min , whereas pERK1 / 2 levels dropped down in wild - type cells to initial levels . If this mechanism holds true also for other EGFR - activated complexes , it can be hypothesized that further signaling pathways might be affected . Amongthem c - Jun isofparticularinterestbecauseithasbeenshowntobeamajorfactorfor Egfr - genetran - scriptionregulation ( Fangetal . , 2014 ; Mialonetal . , 2005 ; Westonetal . , 2004 ) . Wecomparedphospho - c - Jun levels in wild - type and TPC - deﬁcient MEF cells and identiﬁed increased phospho - c - Jun levels in all cells lacking at least one functional TPC gene . Remarkably , this rise was already observable under unstimulated conditions . Thus , we hypothesize that the increased JNK signaling is a major factor that contributes to the high EGFR expression found in TPC - deﬁcient cells . The prolonged EGFR signaling in endolysosomal com - partments caused by deletion of TPCs most likely results in increased JNK signaling , which in turn leads to increased Egfr expression , ultimately forming a positive feedback loop . This positive feedback would be an explanation for the strongly increased amounts of surface accessible EGFRs found in TPC - deﬁcient cells . In summary , our work sheds light on a novel aspect of TPC function in the endolysosomal system . In addi - tion to the well - known effects on trafﬁcking , TPC deletions also inﬂuence gene transcription by ongoing receptor activation in endolysosomal compartments . Limitations of the study Our study was performed with MEF and HeLa cells , but not with primary cells . Particularly with regard to tumor cells , the expression of EGFR may vary within wide limits . We cannot rule out the possibility that in some tumors EGFR - related pathways may be affected in different ways . ll OPEN ACCESS iScience 24 , 102099 , February 19 , 2021 13 iScience Article Resource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulﬁlled by the Lead Con - tact , Norbert Klugbauer ( n . klugbauer @ pharmakol . uni - freiburg . de ) .
