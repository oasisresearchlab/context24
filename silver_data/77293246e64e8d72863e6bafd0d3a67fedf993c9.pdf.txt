However , several problems caused by the adhesion of living cells and extension of the cell membranes seriously affect the image quality during living cell imaging , hindering the study of living cells . In this work , jumping mode AFM imaging was used to image living cells at varied probe lifting heights to meet image quality requirements , and image quality related to the probe lifting height is discussed in detail . The jumping mode was divided into three parts based on the varying heights of the lifted probe , namely near - contact mode , half - jumping mode , and full - jumping mode , and the causes of their imaging drawbacks were analyzed . At an appropriate lifting height , the probe can be completely free from the influence of cell adhesion and self - excited oscillation , thus avoiding the occurrence of “trail” phenomena and invalid points in the imaging of living cells and improving the image quality . Additionally , this work provides a new approach to calculating the lateral force through the adhesion of trace and retrace scanning at a low height , which is important for studying the extension characteristics of the cell membrane .

These important characteristics describe how cells sense , including their division , migration , shape , and interaction with the surrounding environment [ 3 , 4 ] . Hence , studies of living cells are helpful in further understanding the patho - physiology and pathogenesis of human diseases [ 5 , 6 ] . Since its invention , the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) has proven itself to be a standard tool of biological sci - ence . It can image biological samples with high resolu - tion and detect molecular interactions between biological * Zuobin Wang wangz @ cust . edu . cn 1 International Research Centre for Nano Handling and Manufacturing of China , Changchun University of Science and Technology , Changchun 130022 , China 2 Centre for Opto / Bio - Nano Measurement and Manufacturing , Zhongshan Institute of Changchun University of Science and Technology , Zhongshan 528437 , China 3 Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Cross - Scale Micro and Nano Manufacturing , Changchun University of Science and Technology , Changchun 130022 , China 4 JR3CN & IRAC , University of Bedfordshire , Luton LU1 3JU , UK Nanomanufacturing and Metrology ( 2023 ) 6 : 24 1 3 24 Page 2 of 9 molecules under near - physiological conditions [ 7 – 9 ] . With its ability to function in near - physiological condi - tions , AFM can help quantify the geometric and mechani - cal properties of living cells and use these properties to evaluate the effects of drug treatment or different types of pathologies [ 10 , 11 ] . The shapes of eukaryotic cells and the organisms they ultimately form are determined by peri - odic mechanosensing , mechanotransduction , and mecha - noresponse [ 12 ] ; therefore , the cell morphology reflects the interaction among cytoskeletons , cell membrane , and cell – substrate adhesions [ 13 ] . Furthermore , cell morpho - logical transformation has been proven to be the precursor and one of the important influences on gene expression and enzyme reactions [ 14 ] . Stiffness imaging and morpho - logical imaging are helpful for understanding the behavior of living cells [ 15 ] . However , due to the particularities of biological samples ( such as softness , complex morphol - ogy , and high adhesion ) , accurate imaging of living cells in a liquid environment close to the physiological state remains a challenge . According to the force between the tip and sample dur - ing scanning , the working mode of AFM can be categorized into three types , namely contact mode , tapping mode , and intermittent contact mode . The contact mode has some well - known drawbacks , such as for samples with steep edges and those that are soft , sticky , or loosely attached to the surface [ 16 , 17 ] . In the contact mode , the tip is always in contact with the sample during scanning . The direct vertical deflec - tion of the cantilever is used as the feedback signal . An imag - ing setpoint is set , and the feedback adjusts the piezo height to keep this setpoint deflection constant . On the cell surface , where the cell height increases and decreases greatly , the dif - ference between the setpoint and the measured value of the feedback is limited by the free state of the cantilever . Hence , the feedback responds slowly to the changes . This phenom - enon leads to differences in the “UP” and “DOWN” regions of the tip scanning determined by comparing the trace and retrace of scans . When the feedback is not rapid enough for the scan speed and topographic change , the scan lines tend to “trail” as the tip follows the surface downward , making the imaging of cell shapes inaccurate . The shear force eas - ily damages the soft sample when the probe moves laterally [ 18 ] . The most common modes , namely contact mode and traditional tapping mode , deal with undesired forces that might damage or compress the sample . In the tapping mode , the absolute vertical force cannot be controlled , leading to the compression of soft samples and complications on sticky samples [ 19 ] . Some other modes have been developed to overcome the above difficulties . For instance , the jumping mode is used to image the structure of complex biological systems and obtain the force – distance ( FD ) curve array of samples and map them pixel by pixel . This array is directly related to the shape of biological samples . Given that the tip vertically jumps from one image point to another , the jumping mode is named as is [ 20 , 21 ] . The tip moving algo - rithm can prevent the lateral force and control the vertical force , making straightforward nondestructive imaging . This mode can solve problems with soft materials , sticky sam - ples , loosely attached samples , or samples with steep edges . Thus , the jumping mode can fully control the tip – sample force at each pixel of the image . However , the imaging time spent in this mode is longer than that in other modes . Reduc - ing the distance of FD curves of each pixel can reduce the scanning time but may cause some problems in the image , such as “trail” phenomena and invalid points . In this work , we defined the jumping mode in three forms , namely near - contact mode , half - jumping mode , and full - jumping mode , according to the contact height between the tip and the surface of the sample . In each form , the influ - ence factors of the imaging of living cells were analyzed in detail . The causes of “trail” and invalid points in the jump mode were also determined . This study revealed that sys - tematically understanding the effects of the jumping mode on imaging is helpful in obtaining accurate morphological information and shorten the imaging time . By examining the near - contact mode , we proposed a new method to calculate the vertical and lateral adhesion forces on cell surfaces for studying the extensibility of the cell membrane . 2 Materials and Methods Living SMMC - 7721 cells were cultured at 37 °C ( 5 % CO 2 ) in a culture medium ( RPMI - 1640 ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum . All experiments were performed using an atomic force microscope ( NanoWizard BioScience , JPK , Bruker , Germany ) . This device can obtain a complete FD curve at each pixel of the image and give complete infor - mation on the interactions of local tip samples with high spatial resolution . This feature is especially important for obtaining accurate adhesion data because of the dependence of the measured adhesion value on the velocity during the acquisition of an FD curve [ 22 ] . A simplified representation of the tip movement is shown in Fig . 1a and b . The separa - tion distance between the tip and sample ( Z length ) can be set by users . In the jumping mode , the Z piezo extends , moves the can - tilever toward the surface until the setpoint is reached , and retracts it again . An FD curve is collected by each pixel of the image , as shown in Fig . 1c . The cantilever can bend due to changes in the environment , such as temperature , PH , and ionic strength in the liquid . Therefore , a baseline ( the red line ) was used to correct the vertical drift and measured at the beginning of each scan line . In a full force curve , the approaching and retracting parts usually differ ; one of the reasons for this variation is the hydrodynamic resistance on Nanomanufacturing and Metrology ( 2023 ) 6 : 24 1 3 Page 3 of 9 24 the cantilever in the liquid , which leads to a difference in the zero - force line [ 22 , 23 ] . In the contact part of the force curve , the elastic and adhesive deformations of the cell are related to its Young’s modulus , regardless of the approach or retraction stage . The elastic constant K of the sample can be calculated as follows : where E is the Young’s modulus , and 𝜈 is the Poisson’s ratio of the sample . The relationship among force , indentation , and contact radius can be expressed by the Hertz model as follows : where 𝛿 is the indentation , a is the contact radius , R is the radius of the tip , and F n is the applied normal force . The theory of adhesive contact mechanics was proposed by Johnson et al . ( JKR theory ) [ 24 ] , who modified the clas - sical Hertz theory to explain the effect of surface energy . Meanwhile , Refs . [ 25 , 26 ] proposed another theory ( DMT theory ) that is suitable for the small contact area between the tip and the sample . In this study , the tip is a triangular pyra - mid with a small contact area , so the DMT theory was used . The Young’s modulus was calculated by the DMT algorithm after the extended curve was analyzed . The adhesion force was calculated from the maximum force that occurs when the tip leaves the sample in the retract curve .

The cantilever used in the experiments was MLCT - Bio ( 0 . 07 N / m , Bruker ) . The SMMC - 7721 cells were imaged under different conditions by changing the Z value . Three modes were adopted in the experiments . 3 . 1 Full‑Jumping Mode ( Z ≥ 1000 nm ) In the full - jumping mode , no “trail” appeared throughout the different scanning tracks . Given that the tip is in ver - tical contact with the sample , the Z length is sufficient to completely separate the tip from the sample surface . The lateral force between the tip and the sample and the lateral deformation of the surface can be avoided . In addition , the “trail” caused by insufficient feedback can be avoided when the tip scans the surface downward because each pixel of the image depends on the complete FD curve . With the movement , the extension of the tip can be used to describe the attraction , repulsion , or deformation of the sample . When the tip contracts , the interaction can be meas - ured to describe the adhesion , elastic modulus , or energy dissipation of samples , as shown in Fig . 2 . The SMMC - 7721 cells are shaped as irregular circles with a diameter of about 30 μm and height of about 6 μm , as shown in Fig . 2a . As displayed in Fig . 2b , the adhesion of the cells at the edge is greater than that near the nucleus because of the high elasticity and height of the nucleus . As illustrated in Fig . 2c and d , the lifting height Z within this range can clearly and Fig . 1 Schematic view of the tip movements in the jumping mode and the FD curves . a Deformation of the cantilever while it extends and retracts from the surface of the sample . b Tip movement algorithm in the jumping mode ; an FD curve is recorded in the absence of the XY movement of the tip . c FD curve recorded for each pixel ; the numbers on the curve correspond to the marked status in ( a ) ; part ① on the extended line is used as the baseline , which can be used to correct for changes in the vertical deflection of the cantilever over time .

The green circle represents that the tip reaches the setpoint during the extended process . The red circle represents the adhesion force when the tip leaves the sample Nanomanufacturing and Metrology ( 2023 ) 6 : 24 1 3 24 Page 4 of 9 accurately express the physical characteristics and morphol - ogy of the cell . 3 . 2 Half‑jumping mode ( 300 nm < Z < 1000 nm ) When 300 nm < Z < 1000 nm , the morphology of the cells is basically visible under different Z lengths . When the Z length decreases , the “trail” on the image becomes evident , as shown in Fig . 3 . We then analyzed the reasons for the “trail” in the jumping mode by changing the scan angles to 0° and 180° to simulate the trace scanning and retrace scanning of the contact mode . As shown in Figs . 4b – c , the images scanned from different angles have the same “trail” positions ( “DOWN” region , the red circles ) . The “trail” is caused by the difference between the jumping mode and contact mode . The two curves in Figs . 4d and e represent the force curves of the “UP” and “DOWN” regions , respec - tively . Figure 4g reveals that when the tip separates from point A and moves to point B at the “UP” part , the length of the extended force curve ( Z B ) is smaller than the set Z length ( Z s ) because the height of B is larger than that of A . For the same reason , at the “DOWN” part , the length of the extended curve Z D is larger than the set Z length ( Z D > Z s ) because the height of point D is smaller than that of C . On the basis of the measured height curve of the same cell at the full - jumping mode ( the Z length and scan angle are 1000 nm and 0° , respectively ) , the curves of the “UP” and “DOWN” parts can be approximated in a straight line . Therefore , the slopes of the two parts can be calculated as follows : Fig . 2 Height and quantitative maps of multiple properties of the cell with the Z length of 1500 nm . a Height and b adhe - sion maps of the cell . c Map of Young’s modulus , which reflects the elasticity of the cell surface . d 3D map of the cell Fig . 3 Height images changed with the Z length . a , b , and c were imaged at 800 , 600 , and 400 nm , respectively . The morphologies of cells are visible ; when the Z length decreases , the “trail” becomes evi - dent Nanomanufacturing and Metrology ( 2023 ) 6 : 24 1 3 Page 5 of 9 24 Given that the size of the image is 60 × 60 μm and the resolution is 128 × 128 , the length of each X movement is ∆ x = 60 μm / 128 ≈ 469 nm . The higher the resolution , the smaller the ∆ x . With the slopes in Eq . ( 4 ) , the height varia - tion of each X movement on the sample can be calculated as This relationship can be seen from the error length between the extended curve and the retracted curve . The errors can be expressed as ( 4 ) { K u = ( H 2 − H 1 ) ∕ ( X 2 − X 1 ) ≈ 0 . 18 K d = ( H 3 − H 2 ) ∕ ( X 3 − X 2 ) ≈ − 0 . 27 ( 5 ) { Δ H u = K u × Δ x ≈ 84 . 4 nm Δ H d = K d × Δ x ≈ − 126 . 6 nm ( 6 ) Δ Z = Z r − Z e Here , Z r is the length of the retracted curve , and Z e is the length of the extended curve . When the tip is in the “UP” part , the value of ∆ Z is similar to ∆ H u ( Fig . 4d ) . When the tip is in the “DOWN” part , the value of ∆ Z is similar to ∆ H d ( Fig . 4e ) . In the “trail” area ( the red circle in Fig . 4h ) of the “DOWN” part , the length of the extended curve Z ′ D at the point D ′ is less than Z D at the point D . When the tip reaches D ′ , the set point is reached due to interference , making Z ′ D smaller than Z D . The error value between the measured height and the actual height is expressed as : Figures 4g and h represent the morphology of the same line on the cell with Z length of 1000 and 500 nm , respectively . The height error of the two measurements is 206 nm , which is extremely close to Z t = 203 nm calcu - lated using Eq . ( 7 ) . Therefore , the reason for the “trail” ( 7 ) Z t = | | Z � e − Z e | | Fig . 4 a Height image with the Z length of 1000 nm . b and c are imaged at 500 nm , and the white arrows indicate the scanning direc - tion , and the red circles show where the “trail” occurs . d and e are the force curves of points B and D in ( a ) , respectively . The value of Δ Z in d is 0 . 083 μm , and the value of Δ Z in e is 0 . 118 μm . f is the force curve of point D in ( b ) . g and h are the heights of the cell at the blue lines in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively Nanomanufacturing and Metrology ( 2023 ) 6 : 24 1 3 24 Page 6 of 9 occurrence is the inaccurate judgment of the tip on the setpoint . The Z length is not large enough to overcome the separation point caused by adhesion , as observed from the retracted curve of Fig . 4f . As a result , the initial amplitude of the extended curve of the next point changes dramati - cally , and the baseline becomes difficult to calculate . In the case of an inaccurate baseline , errors are obtained in the measurement of the set point and the calculation of height . This mode in such a condition is called the half - jumping mode . 3 . 3 Near‑contact mode ( 0 nm < Z ≤ 300 nm ) When the Z length is less than 300 nm , the tip does not have enough distance to separate from the sample and is nearly in contact with the sample during scanning . Therefore , we defined this mode as the near - contact mode . Figure 5 shows that with the decrease in Z length , the number of invalid points gradually increases in the imaging process and finally affects the photo quality . The height of the tip ( Z length ) can - not reach the changing height of the sample , i . e . , Z s < ∆ H , where ∆ H is the height variation of the sample in each X movement . When the tip reaches the next point of the pixel , the deformation of the cantilever directly reaches or exceeds the set point value , leading to insufficient or even a lack of data on the extended curve . To improve the imaging qual - ity , we can increase the value of Z s and decrease the value of ∆ H . ∆ H can be achieved by increasing the resolution ( decrease the ∆ x ) . In the near - contact mode , diverse morphologies simi - lar to the trace and retrace scanning of the contact mode were observed when the same cell was imaged at different angles . Figure 6 shows that the morphology and adhesion differ for varying angles . A comparison of the adhesion and height of the same position in the two pictures reveals that the different parts of the sample have varying errors ( Table 1 ) . In Table 1 , each point is the same position in the two images . Figure 6a displays the “trace” and the “UP” part of the cytoplasmic , and Fig . 6b shows the “retrace” and the “DOWN” part of the cytoplasmic . F l and Z v are the calculated lateral force and the vertical length , respec - tively , and the error is the absolute value . The errors of the cytoplasmic part are larger than those of the substrate and the nuclear parts . When the adhesion of the cell at the Fig . 5 Height images changed with the Z length . a is imaged at 1000 nm , and the cell is imaged clearly . b is imaged at 300 nm , the invalid points ( black points ) begin to appear . c is imaged at 200 nm , a large number of invalid points ( black points ) appear at the “UP” part , and the cell morphology is basically visible . d is imaged at 100 nm , and the cell morphology cannot be identified Nanomanufacturing and Metrology ( 2023 ) 6 : 24 1 3 Page 7 of 9 24 “UP” part was measured in the vertical direction , the tip moved similarly to the shape change of the sample . The adhesion of the cell at the “DOWN” part is a combination of vertical and horizontal forces . Therefore , the adhesions of the “UP” and “DOWN” parts at the same point can be obtained by scanning the same position at the opposite angle . The lateral adhesion force can be calculated via the mechanical decomposition shown in Fig . 6e , and the results are listed in Table 1 . Given that the tip is almost in contact with the sam - ple during scanning , the above hypothesis was tested by examining the deformation of the cell surface . The lat - eral force F l corresponds to the lateral deformation X l , and X l = ∆ x = 469 nm . According to the proper orthogonal decomposition , Z v can be calculated as follows : The results are listed in Table 1 . The obtained values of Z v are almost equal to the absolute value of the errors between the two height measurements by different angles . This finding proves that the two scanning errors in differ - ent directions are obtained because the tip cannot detach from the adhesion force , leading to the extension of the cell membrane . Therefore , the correctness of the assump - tion that the lateral adhesion force can be obtained by ( 8 ) Z v ∕ X l = F v ∕ F l Fig . 6 a , b Height images with a Z length of 300 nm . c and d are the adhesion maps of the cell , and the white arrows indicate the scanning directions . e Schematic view of the decomposition of adhesion , where F v is the adhesion in the vertical direction , F l is the adhesion in the lateral direction , F c is the resultant force of F v and F l , Z v is the defor - mation in the vertical direction , and X l is the deformation Fin the lat - eral direction Table 1 Examples of the points in the two images from Figs . 6a – b Number Area Trace Retrace Error Height ( μm ) Adhesion ( nN ) Height ( μm ) Adhesion ( nN ) Height ( μm ) Adhesion ( nN ) F l ( nN ) Z v ( μm ) 1 Substrate 3 . 264 2 . 557 3 . 20 2 . 50 0 . 064 0 . 057 – – 2 3 . 227 2 . 575 3 . 251 2 . 616 0 . 024 0 . 041 – – 3 3 . 148 2 . 692 3 . 213 2 . 644 0 . 065 0 . 048 – – 4 Nuclear 7 . 917 1 . 748 7 . 98 1 . 76 0 . 063 0 . 012 – – 5 7 . 548 1 . 952 7 . 53 1 . 936 0 . 018 0 . 016 – – 6 Cytoplasmic 3 . 102 3 . 018 3 . 486 4 . 621 0 . 384 1 . 603 3 . 499 0 . 404 7 3 . 019 2 . 86 3 . 4041 4 . 351 0 . 385 1 . 491 3 . 279 0 . 409 8 3 . 676 3 . 573 4 . 113 5 . 246 0 . 437 1 . 673 3 . 842 0 . 436 9 3 . 968 2 . 673 4 . 329 4 . 248 0 . 361 1 . 575 3 . 302 0 . 380 10 3 . 089 3 . 156 3 . 539 4 . 455 0 . 450 1 . 299 3 . 144 0 . 471 Nanomanufacturing and Metrology ( 2023 ) 6 : 24 1 3 24 Page 8 of 9 decomposing the adhesion force at the “DOWN” part has been proven . 4 Conclusions In this work , the imaging effects of living cells at differ - ent heights in the jumping mode of AFM are compared , and the imaging quality at different heights is analyzed . The cause of the “trail” phenomenon and invalid points in living cell imaging is studied , and the Z length of the best image is determined by analyzing the mechanical changes of the probe in contact with the cell and combining these changes with the alterations in cell morphology . The optimal value of Z length avoids the influence of adhesion on the accuracy of probes and reduces the influence of too large Z value on the increase in cell imaging time , thus improving the accuracy and image quality of living cell imaging . Taking SMMC - 7721 cells as an example , high - quality images of cell morphology can be obtained when the lifting height Z is higher than 1000 nm . However , the high lifting height of the tip can cause a long imaging time . When the lifting height Z is between 300 and 1000 nm , the imaging time is relatively short . Adhesion force has a small effect on the tip and causes errors in the image , such as the “trail” phenomenon , but does not affect the expression of the overall morphology of the cell . Therefore , the Z value at the critical point where the tip is completely free from the influence of cell adhesion can ensure the image quality and is the best choice for imaging time ; that is , the size of Z is 1000 nm for SMMC - 7721 cells . This principle can serve as a guide in finding the best image lifting height for different cells . This work also provides a new method to calculate the lateral force through the adhesion of trace and retrace scan - ning at a low height . Through the comparison of height and adhesion between trace and retrace scanning , the point with skew force is decomposed vertically and horizontally . With these known vertical parameters of the point in the opposite direction , the lateral force in the horizontal direction can be obtained . This finding is helpful for the study of cell mem - brane extension characteristics in the future .
