These organelles act in con - cert with mitochondria to control the metabolism of lipids and reactive oxygen species . However , while mitochondria have emerged as an important site of antiviral signal transduction , a role for peroxisomes in immune defense is unknown . Here , we report that the RIG - I - like receptor ( RLR ) adaptor protein MAVS is located on peroxisomes and mitochondria . We ﬁnd that peroxisomal and mitochondrial MAVS act sequentially to create an antiviral cellular state . Upon viral infection , peroxisomal MAVS induces the rapid interferon - independent expression of defense factors that provide short - term protection , whereas mitochondrial MAVS activates an interferon - depen - dent signaling pathway with delayed kinetics , which ampliﬁes and stabilizes the antiviral response . The interferon regulatory factor IRF1 plays a crucial role in regulating MAVS - dependent signaling from perox - isomes . These results establish that peroxisomes are an important site of antiviral signal transduction . INTRODUCTION A fundamental feature of eukaryotic cells is the use of mem - brane - bound organelles to compartmentalize activities and serve as scaffolds for signal transduction . The best - character - ized signaling pathways involve membrane - bound receptors that respond to extracellular or lumenal stimuli . In these instances , the spatial separation of an extracellular stimulus from the cytosol mandates the use of organelles as signaling platforms , as transmembrane receptors must transmit informa - tion across a lipid bilayer . However , an important gap exists in our knowledge of how stimuli from the cytosol are able to initiate speciﬁc signaling events . How common is the use of organelles in signal transduction from cytosolic receptors ? An example of this situation can be found in the study of virus - host interactions . The ability to detect cytosolic viruses depends on the RIG - I - like receptor ( RLR ) family of proteins , which are soluble RNA helicases that detect viruses containing RNA ( and in some cases DNA ) genomes ( Ablasser et al . , 2009 ; Chiu et al . , 2009 ; Yoneyama et al . , 2004 ) . The best characterized RLRs , RIG - I and MDA - 5 , detect 5 0 - triphosphate - containingshortdouble - strandedRNA ( dsRNA ) andlongdsRNA , respectively ( Kato et al . , 2008 ; Pichlmair et al . , 2006 ) . RLRs can either detect viral RNA directly or after RNA polymerase III - medi - ated transcription of microbial DNA ( Ablasser et al . , 2009 ; Chiu et al . , 2009 ; Kato et al . , 2008 ) . Mice deﬁcient in either of these RLRs are sensitive to different classes of viruses , underscoring both their speciﬁcity of action and their importance in immune defense ( Gitlin et al . , 2006 ; Kato et al . , 2006 ) . Although RIG - I and MDA - 5 have speciﬁcities for different ligands , both induce a common signaling pathway that triggers the expression of type I interferons ( IFNs ) and IFN - stimulated genes ( ISGs ) . Many ISGs function as direct antiviral effec - tors , acting to prevent viral genome replication , viral particle assembly , or virion release from infected cells . Generally , it is thought that RLRs induce the expression of IFNs that act in both autocrine and paracrine manners to amplify ISG expres - sion . However , ISGs can also be induced directly upon viral infection , without the need for IFN signaling ( Collins et al . , 2004 ; Mossman et al . , 2001 ) . At the receptor - proximal level , RLR - dependent responses are regulated by the adaptor pro - tein MAVS ( also called IPS - 1 , Cardif , or VISA ) ( Nakhaei et al . , 2009 ) . Upon viral detection , MAVS binds to RLRs and promotes the activation of NF - k B , AP - 1 , and various interferon regulatory factors ( IRFs ) , which act to induce ISGs and create an antiviral state in the cell . Although much has been learned about the genetics of RLR signaling , less is known about where within 668 Cell 141 , 668 – 681 , May 14 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . the cell signal transduction occurs . Identifying the sites of RLR signal transduction is critical to understanding how antiviral networks are integrated into the general cellular infrastructure within which they operate . The ﬁrst clue that cytosolic RLR signaling may occur from organelles came from studies of the MAVS adaptor . MAVS contains a C - terminal transmembrane domain that anchors it to the mitochondrial outer membrane ( Seth et al . , 2005 ) . It is from this location that MAVS is thought to engage active RLRs and induce signal transduction . Whether mitochondria are the only organelles that promote RLR - mediated signaling has not been addressed . Mitochondria have long been appreciated to have an intimate functional relationship with peroxisomes ( Hettema and Motley , 2009 ) . Both are membrane - bound organelles found in mammalian cells and are involved in the metabolism of lipids and reactive oxygenspecies . However , whilemitochondriaarewell - established sites of both antiviral signaling and antiviral apoptosis , peroxi - somes are thought to function solely as metabolic organelles . Recently , several mitochondrial proteins have been found to reside also on peroxisomes . Included in this group are the outer membrane proteins Fis1 and Mff , which regulate the morphology of both organelles ( Gandre - Babbe and van der Bliek , 2008 ; Koch et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , Fis1 , Mff , and MAVS all have similar domain structures : each contains an N - terminal effector domain and a C - terminal localization motif , which consists of a trans - membrane domain and a short lumenal tail containing basic amino acids . That other so - called ‘‘tail - anchored’’ mitochondrial outer membrane proteins operate from peroxisomes raised the possibility that MAVS also functions from these organelles . We have discovered that MAVS does indeed reside on perox - isomes and can induce antiviral signaling from this organelle . Our work supports a model whereby peroxisomal MAVS induces the immediate expression of antiviral factors that function to contain a nascent infection . Long - term containment of the infec - tion , however , requires the function of mitochondrial MAVS as well . These data demonstrate that peroxisomes are not simply metabolic organelles , but rather serve as critical subcellular hubs that promote MAVS - dependent antiviral immunity . RESULTS MAVS Is Located on Both Mitochondria and Peroxisomes MAVS has a similar domain organization to other tail - anchored membrane proteins that function from mitochondria and perox - isomes ( Gandre - Babbe and van der Bliek , 2008 ; Koch et al . , 2005 ) . We therefore sought to determine whether MAVS also resides on peroxisomes . The subcellular localization of MAVS was examined in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) whose peroxisomes were marked by a DsRed allele containing a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal ( PTS1 ) . In addition to staining structures that appeared to be mitochondria , MAVS was detected on PTS1 - positive peroxisomes scattered throughout the cell ( Figure 1A ) . A similar staining pattern was seen for Mff ( Figure 1A ) , which functions from both peroxisomes and mito - chondria ( Gandre - Babbe and van der Bliek , 2008 ) . In contrast , the Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) adaptor protein TIRAP ( Fitzgerald et al . , 2001 ; Horng et al . , 2001 ) was not detected on peroxisomes ( Figure 1A ) . To conﬁrm that the peroxisomal staining was dis - tinct from mitochondria , we also stained cells with MitoTracker . Although no costaining was detected between PTS1 and Mito - Tracker , MAVS was detected on both PTS1 - positive peroxi - somes and MitoTracker - positive mitochondria ( Figure 1B ) . Sim - ilar results were obtained when epitope - tagged MAVS in murine macrophages ( Figure S1 available online ) or endogenous MAVS in human hepatocytes were examined ( Figure 1C ) . As an inde - pendent means of assessing MAVS localization , hepatocytes were biochemically fractionated to separate peroxisomes and mitochondria , which were respectively distinguished by Pex14 and mtHSP70 ( Figure 1D ) . Both MAVS and Fis1 ( a protein that occupies both organelles [ Koch et al . , 2005 ] ) were detected in fractions containing either peroxisomes or mitochondria . Collec - tively , on the basis of studies in both human and mouse cells , these data establish that peroxisomes are a bona ﬁde reservoir of the RLR adaptor protein MAVS . One possible reason MAVS is present on peroxisomes is that newly synthesized MAVS might ﬁrst pass through peroxisomes en route to mitochondria . To address this possibility , we used human ﬁbroblasts from a patient lacking a functional Pex19 protein . Pex19 controls peroxisome biogenesis , and thus Pex19 - deﬁcient cells contain no peroxisomes or peroxisomal remnant structures ( Matsuzono et al . , 1999 ; Sacksteder et al . , 2000 ) . Notably , MAVS was delivered to mitochondria in Pex19 - deﬁcient cells ( Figure 1E ) , indicating that the pathway to mitochondria does not require a peroxisomal intermediate . Moreover , MAVS localized to both peroxisomes and mitochondria in Pex19 - deﬁ - cient cells that expressed Pex19 after transient transfection or retroviral gene transfer ( Figure 1E ) . It is therefore unlikely that localizationofMAVStoperoxisomesistheresultofabiosynthetic pathwayfordeliveringoutermembraneproteinstomitochondria . A Systematic Strategy to Separate Functions of Peroxisomal and Mitochondrial MAVS Our ﬁnding that MAVS is located on peroxisomes raised the possibility that these organelles serve as a site of antiviral signal transduction . We ﬁrst considered using Pex19 - deﬁcient cells to address sufﬁciency of mitochondrial MAVS in antiviral sig - naling , but since peroxisomes are required for biochemical pro - cesses that occur in mitochondria , Pex19 - deﬁcient cells have profound defects in mitochondrial function ( Wanders , 2004 ) . We therefore used the alternative approach of genetically sepa - rating the putative mitochondrial and peroxisomal functions of MAVS . This was accomplished by replacing the previously deﬁned MAVS localization motif ( Seth et al . , 2005 ) with a set of domains that instead direct the protein to a single compartment ( Figure 2A ) . Using the localization motif of the peroxin Pex13 ( Fransen et al . , 2001 ) , we created a protein called MAVS - Pex . By deleting the MAVS localization motif , we also created a cyto - solic allele ( MAVS - Cyto ) ( Seth et al . , 2005 ) . Because the ﬁdelity of mitochondrial sorting signals is not always transferrable to other proteins ( Ingelmo - Torres et al . , 2009 ) , we lastly created two different alleles of MAVS containing a sorting signal derived from two proteins residing on the mitochondrial outer membrane protein , either OMP25 or Fis1 ( Koch et al . , 2005 ; Nemoto and De Camilli , 1999 ) . Cell 141 , 668 – 681 , May 14 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 669 Using retroviral gene transfer of MAVS - KO MEFs , we created cell lines expressing comparable levels of each MAVS allele ( Figures 2B and 2C ) and determined their localizations by con - focal microscopy . Full - length MAVS ( MAVS - WT ) was located on both mitochondria and peroxisomes ( data not shown ) , and MAVS - Cyto was found on neither organelle ( Figure 2D and Pex19 stable expression Pex19 deficient fibroblasts Pex19 stable expression Pex19 transient expression A B E C D PTS1 PTS1 PTS1 MAVS MAVS MAVS PTS1 PTS1 MFF TIRAP MAVS mtHSP70 mtHSP70 MAVS PTS1 MAVS merge merge merge merge merge merge merge merge merge Mitotracker PTS1 MAVS IB : MAVS IB : Fis1 IB : Pex14 Fraction : 3 21 19 18 17 14 9 8 IB : mtHSP70 Figure 1 .

Mitochondria were stained with anti - mtHSP70 antibody . Peroxisomes were visualized by transfection with a bicistronic construct encoding EGFP - PTS1 and Pex19 . See also Figure S1 . 670 Cell 141 , 668 – 681 , May 14 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . Figure S2 ) . As expected , MAVS - Pex was found exclusively on peroxisomes ( Figure 2D and Figure S2 ) . Of the alleles contain - ing the putative mitochondrial targeting sequences , the allele harboring the Fis1 transmembrane domain was found primarily on mitochondria , whereas the one containing the OMP25 transmembrane domain was located on both mitochondria and peroxisomes ( Figure 2D and Figure S2 ) . We therefore refer to the mitochondria - speciﬁc allele as MAVS - Mito to indicate its exclu - sive localization to mitochondria and the allele found on both organelles as MAVS - Mimic to indicate its ability to copy the localization pattern of MAVS - WT . Collectively , this set of MAVS - expressing MEF lines differs only in the subcellular posi - tioning of the signaling domain of MAVS and thereby provides an ideal system to determine the relative roles of mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization in MAVS - dependent signal transduction . MAVS - Dependent Signaling Occurs from Both Peroxisomes and Mitochondria To address the function of peroxisomal MAVS , we monitored the expression of antiviral factors in response to infection with reovirus .

Peroxisomes were visualized by trans - fection with DsRed - PTS1 . Note that MAVS - Pex resides on peroxisomes , MAVS - Mito on mito - chondria , MAVS - Mimic on both organelles , and MAVS - Cyto localizes on neither of the two organ - elles . All images for all panels are representative of at least three independent experiments where over 500 cells were examined per condition and > 95 % of the cells displayed similar staining . See also Figure S2 . both RIG - I and MDA - 5 signaling path - ways ( Loo et al . , 2008 ) , allowing direct examination of both RLRs in a single experiment . Cells were infected with reovirus , and extracts were examined at various times for expression of viperin , a well - charac - terized ISG ( Chin and Cresswell , 2001 ; Severa et al . , 2006 ) . MAVS - WT - , - Mimic - , or - Mito - expressing cells induced viperin expression in response to infection ( Figure 3A ) . This response was MAVS dependent , as MAVS - KO cells showed no change in viperin expression . MAVS - Cyto cells were unable to induce vi - perinexpression , conﬁrmingthatmembranelocalizationisneces - sary for MAVS function ( Seth et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , despite the fact that MAVS - Pex is found only on peroxisomes , MAVS - Pex cells induced viperin expression after infection ( Figure 3A ) . An examination of the kinetics of ISG induction indicated that cells containing MAVS on peroxisomes ( MAVS - WT , - Mimic , and - Pex ) induced viperin expression within 4 hr of infection . In contrast , exclusive localization to mitochondria ( MAVS - Mito ) resulted in viperin expression with delayed kinetics ( Figure 3A ) . These results suggest that localization of MAVS to either perox - isomes or mitochondria is sufﬁcient to induce antiviral signaling but that peroxisomal residence allows for more rapid expression of ISGs . Interestingly , rapid expression of ISGs by MAVS - Pex appeared to be transient , as viperin expression decreased at later times of infection ( Figure 3A ) . To determine whether peroxisomal signaling by MAVS requires signaling by both RIG - I and MDA - 5 , we performed Cell 141 , 668 – 681 , May 14 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 671 similar experiments using inﬂuenza virus , which activates the RIG - I pathway exclusively ( Gitlin et al . , 2006 ; Kato et al . , 2006 ) . A similar pattern of viperin expression was observed with inﬂu - enza as with reovirus , although the kinetic differences between MAVS - Pex and - Mito were even more pronounced with inﬂuenza ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , RIG - I signaling alone is sufﬁcient to induce MAVS - dependent signaling from peroxisomes . In sum , these data indicate that peroxisomal MAVS induces rapid but tran - sient viperin expression , whereas mitochondrial MAVS induces delayed but stable viperin expression . Signaling from both organelles thus contributes to the rapid and stable expression of viperin that is observed in MAVS - WT cells . While the above studies provide strong genetic evidence for MAVS signaling from peroxisomes in a population of cells , they do not allow us to examine individual cells for compart - ment - speciﬁc signaling events . To address this , we took advan - tage of the fact that various signaling pathways induce morpho - logical changes in the organelles where signaling occurs , including RLR - dependent activities on mitochondria ( Castanier et al . , 2010 ; Yasukawa et al . , 2009 ) . We reasoned that if signaling was actually occurring on these organelles , then their morphology may change during viral infection .

See also Figure S3 . prediction , reovirus infection induced peroxisomal aggregation and the forma - tion of peroxisomal tubules ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . The tubes formed ranged from approximately 2 m m in length to over 5 m m and depended on MAVS localization to peroxisomes . Cells expressing MAVS - WT exhibited this activity , and cells ex - pressing MAVS - Pex have greatly exagger - ated behavior in these assays , with nearly all cells displaying peroxisomes over 5 m m in length ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . Cells expressing MAVS - Mito or MAVS - Cyto ex - hibited little or no change in peroxisome morphology . These data suggest that RLRs engage peroxi - somal MAVS to induce peroxisomal tubules and that the extent of tubulation is determined by the concentration of MAVS on these organelles . These independent assays demonstrate that MAVS - dependent signaling occurs locally ( on the peroxisome ) . Peroxisomal MAVS Triggers an IFN - Independent Signaling Pathway that Promotes ISG Expression The different kinetics of viperin induction by peroxisomal and mitochondrial MAVS suggest that more than one mechanism of RLR - induced ISG expression may operate in virus - infected cells . ISG expression can be induced directly , or it can be induced indirectly through the action of secreted type I IFNs ( Collins et al . , 2004 ; Mossman et al . , 2001 ) . To determine whether IFNs contribute to expression of ISGs induced by mito - chondrial or peroxisomal MAVS , we monitored the rate of IFN production by reovirus - infected cells . As expected , IFN produc - tion was dependent on membrane - localized MAVS , and all mitochondrial MAVS proteins ( MAVS - WT , - Mimic , and - Mito ) triggered IFN production , though with delayed kinetics in the case of MAVS - Mito ( Figure 3C ) . These data indicate that in the case of the mitochondria - localized MAVS proteins , IFN 672 Cell 141 , 668 – 681 , May 14 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . expression coincides with ISG induction . Surprisingly , no detect - able IFNs were produced by MAVS - Pex cells . Similar results were obtained with cells infected with inﬂuenza virus ( Figure 3D ) , though the relative amounts of IFNs produced with these two viruses differed dramatically , reﬂecting unique aspects of each virus life cycle . However , our inability to detect a role for IFNs in promoting viperin expression in MAVS - Pex cells was not due to an inability of the cells to respond to IFNs , because addition of recombinant IFN b was sufﬁcient to induce viperin expression in all cells examined ( Figure 3E ) . The observation that viperin can be expressed in the absence of type I IFN induction suggests that IFNs may not contribute to ISG expression induced by peroxisomal MAVS . We tested this possibility by infecting cells under conditions in which the func - tions of IFNs are prevented , by either disrupting protein secre - tion with brefeldin A ( BFA ) or by utilizing neutralizing antibodies against secreted IFNs . Both treatments disrupted the activity of type I IFNs produced during reovirus infection ( Figures 4A and 4B ) and inhibited the expression of viperin by cells expressing mitochondrial MAVS ( MAVS - WT , - Mimic , and - Mito ) ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . These data indicate that signaling by IFNs promotes viperin expression . However , because these treatments did not completely abolish viperin expression , an IFN - independent pathway of viperin induction must also exist . Interestingly , MAVS signaling from peroxisomes primarily utilized the IFN - indepen - dent pathway , as viperin expression within MAVS - Pex cells was largely resistant to these treatments ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . These data therefore indicate that the subcellular positioning of MAVS determines the type of signaling pathway activated during viral infection . Peroxisomal MAVS induces the rapid and direct expression of viperin , which is followed by mitochon - drial MAVS triggering viperin expression directly , as well as indi - rectly through the IFN - mediated feed - forward loop . The Global Transcriptional Response to Reovirus Infection Is Mediated by the Collective Actions of MAVS - Dependent Peroxisomal and Mitochondrial Signaling Based on the set of candidate genes examined , our data sug - gests that peroxisomal and mitochondrial MAVS each induce a complementary set of genes that are collectively induced by MAVS - WT . To determine whether this is the case , microarrays were performed on reovirus - infected cells . Infections were per - formed for 3 , 9 , or 16 hr , and RNA was collected for genome - wide expression analysis . At all times examined , similar expres - sion proﬁles were observed when MAVS - WT and MAVS - Mimic cells were compared , conﬁrming that similarities in MAVS local - ization are predictive of similarities in MAVS function ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . These cells induced the expression of numerous ISGs , IFNs , and chemokines ( Figure 5C ) . Notably , we were unable to detect the expression of the proinﬂammatory cytokines TNF a , IL - 1 b , or IL - 6 ( data not shown ) .

Interestingly , MAVS - Pex - or - Mito - expressing cells displayed a transcriptome that each partially overlapped with that of MAVS - WT cells , but were distinct from one another ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . For example , at 16 hr after infection , MAVS - Mito cells upregulated genes encoding chemokines , ISGs , IFN b , and several IFN a family members ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . MAVS - Pex cells also induced the expression of chemokines and ISGs , but without any detectable changes in IFN expression and with much faster kinetics ( within 3 hr ) . Thus , on a global scale , peroxisomal MAVS induces the rapid expression of ISGs without inducing IFN expression , whereas mitochondrial MAVS promotes IFN and ISG expression but with delayed kinetics . We conﬁrmed these results by examining the expression of several candidate IFNs and ISGs using nCounter , which allows for multiplex analysis of gene expression with the sensitivity of quantitative RT - PCR ( Geiss et al . , 2008 ) ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . Overall , at all times examined , most genes expressed by either peroxisomal or mitochondrial MAVS were induced by MAVS - WT or - Mimic ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . These data therefore support a model whereby the host transcriptional response is the result of MAVS signaling from both mitochondria and perox - isomes . We do note however , that the magnitude of antiviral gene expression induced by cells expressing MAVS - WT or MAVS - Mimic was greater than the magnitude induced by cells where MAVS was restricted to a single organelle , which sug - gests that signaling from both organelles may be coordinated to ensure maximal antiviral gene expression . Peroxisomal Signal Transduction Creates a Transient but Functional Antiviral State MAVS - dependent signaling promotes an antiviral state , which is functionally deﬁned as the ability of cells to restrict multiplication of viruses . To determine the signiﬁcance of mitochondrial or peroxisomal signaling pathways in this regard , we asked whether signaling from either organelle is sufﬁcient to restrict viral replication . We addressed this by infecting MAVS - express - ing cells with reovirus and measuring production of infectious virions over time . As expected , MAVS - WT and - Mimic cells were most resistant to infection , and MAVS - KO and - Cyto cells were most susceptible ( Figure 6A ) . These data indicate that MAVS signaling is required to limit reovirus replication . Interest - ingly , cells expressing MAVS - Pex or MAVS - Mito exhibited an unusual biphasic behavior . Over the ﬁrst 24 hr , these cells restricted viral replication as well as MAVS - WT , but this capacity diminished , and by 72 hr were most similar to the MAVS - KO cells . These data establish that signaling from either peroxi - somes or mitochondria is sufﬁcient to induce a functional anti - viral response , but signaling from both organelles is necessary for maximal containment of reovirus replication . Vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) is one of many viruses that interfere with type I IFN expression as part of their pathogenic lifecycle ( Figures 6B and 6C ) ( Ferran and Lucas - Lenard , 1997 ) . Under these conditions , the IFN - independent means of signaling that is induced by peroxisomal MAVS may be particularly impor - tant in controlling infection . Consistent with this idea , MAVS - Mito cells were as susceptible to VSV infection as MAVS - KO or - Cyto cells ( Figure 6D ) , suggesting that in the absence of IFN produc - tion , the mitochondrial signaling pathway is functionally defec - tive . Most notably , MAVS - Pex cells were nearly as effective at controlling VSV as MAVS - WT cells ( Figure 6D ) . These results suggest that MAVS signaling from peroxisomes is the primary means of controlling viruses that interfere with IFN expression , thus underscoring the importance of this organelle in host defense . Downstream Regulators of MAVS Signaling from Peroxisomes To identify downstream signaling regulators of peroxisomal MAVS , we overexpressed each MAVS allele in 293T human kidney epithelial cells . MAVS - WT , - Mimic , - Mito , and - Pex each induced the activation of reporter genes controlled by NF - k B and AP - 1 ( Figure 6E ) . In addition , an IRF1 reporter and an ISRE that typically reports IRF3 activity were induced , sug - gesting a role of these IRFs in MAVS signaling from peroxisomes ( Figure 6E ) . MAVS - Cyto did not activate any reporter . Within these cells , we found that ISRE activation by either MAVS - WT or MAVS - Pex was potentiated by overexpression of TRAF3 and inhibited by expression of a dominant negative allele of TRAF6 ( Figure S5A ) , suggesting the involvement of these known RLR regulators in peroxisomal signaling ( Saha et al . , 2006 ; Yosh - ida et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , expression of a dominant - negative allele of the antiviral factor FADD has a minimal affect on MAVS signaling ( Figure S5A ) , which is consistent with a recent report ( Balachandran et al . , 2007 ) . Notably , overexpression of NLRX1 , a negative regulator that is uniquely located on mito - chondria ( Figure S5B ) ( Moore et al . , 2008 ) did not interfere with MAVS - Pex signaling , but did inhibit signaling by MAVS - WT ( Figure S5A ) . To conﬁrm the roles of IRF1 and IRF3 in peroxisomal signaling , we enlisted VSV to study the IFN - independent means of ISG expression , since only the peroxisomal pathway functions to control replication of this virus , although some ISGs were Figure 5 .

MEFs derived from various IRF - KO mice were infected with VSV and assessed for their ability to induce ISGs .

Cell Type - Speciﬁc Actions of Peroxisomal and Mitochondrial MAVS The prototypical innate - immune adaptor MyD88 regulates TLR signaling and induces different transcriptional responses in different cell types . Whether other adaptor proteins also display this diversity of responses is unclear . To address this for MAVS , we examined the func - tion of peroxisomal and mitochondrial MAVS in macrophages . Each MAVS allele was ex - pressed in immortalized bone marrow - derived macrophages isolated from MAVS - KO mice . The localization of each MAVS protein was similar to that observed in MEFs ( compare Figures S2 and S5C ) . In response to reovirus infection , macrophages that contained mito - chondrial MAVS ( MAVS - WT or - Mito ) induced transcripts encoding IFNs ( Figure 7C ) and ISGs ( Figure S5D ) . MAVS - Cyto was unable to induce gene expression in response to reovirus infec - tion . Unlike MEFs , reovirus - infected macro - phages expressed inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL - 1 b ( Figure 7D ) , IL - 6 , IL - 12b , and TNF a ( Figure S5D and data not shown ) . Another difference between MEFs and macrophages was that MAVS - Mito - expressing macrophages exhibited no kinetic delay in reovirus - induced gene expression . These results suggest that like the TLR adaptor MyD88 , the function of MAVS is controlled in a cell type - speciﬁc way . Peroxisomal MAVS induced the expression of some genes to the same levels observed with the WT allele , such as A20 , IL - 1 b , Cox2 , CXCL2 ( MIP - 2 a ) , CCL4 ( MIP - 1 b ) , and Fos ( Figure 7D ) , 676 Cell 141 , 668 – 681 , May 14 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . whereas others were induced more than 3 - fold but still less than in WT cells , e . g . , viperin , IFIT1 , and IFIT2 ( Figure S5D ) . Of note , peroxisomal MAVS was unable to induce the expression of any IFN gene in macrophages ( Figure 7C ) . Thus , despite cell type - speciﬁc activities of MAVS , a fundamental feature of the RLR signaling network appears to be that peroxisomal MAVS func - tions to promote an IFN - independent means of gene expression . DISCUSSION The best - characterized sensors of cytosolic viruses are mem - bers of the RLR family , which enlist the adaptor protein MAVS to initiate antiviral signaling ( Kawai and Akira , 2007 ) . MAVS is one of a growing group of tail - anchored membrane proteins , which contain a C - terminal transmembrane domain ( Gandre - Babbe and van der Bliek , 2008 ; Koch et al . , 2005 ; Seth et al . , 2005 ) . This anchor was originally reported to promote MAVS recruitment to the mitochondrial outer membrane , providing a landmark of where RLR signaling can occur ( Seth et al . , 2005 ) . This discovery established that cytosolic detection systems , like extracellular detection systems ( e . g . , TLRs ) , use membranes asscaffoldsforsignaltransduction . IntheTLRnetwork , however , signaling occurs from a variety of different organelles , not just one ( Barton and Kagan , 2009 ) . We report here that in addition to mitochondria , the antiviral signaling protein MAVS is located on peroxisomes in several human and murine cell types . Thecentralﬁnding ofthis study—thatperoxisomes are asiteof signal transduction—was established with a complementary set of assays that measured ( 1 ) messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) encoding ISGs and IFNs , ( 2 ) protein levels of ISGs and IFNs , ( 3 ) the induc - tion of a functional antiviral state in cells , and ( 4 ) infection - induced changes in peroxisome morphology . In each of these assays , we found that peroxisomes are a site of MAVS - depen - dent signaling . Moreover , we obtained these results by using several unrelated RNA viruses as physiological triggers of RLR signaling , which suggests that peroxisomal signaling is a funda - mental component of the RLR network . The RLR signaling network now joins the TLRs as pattern recognition systems that signal from multiple organelles . Both systems require that a transmembrane protein be positioned on speciﬁc organelles—the receptors themselves in the case of TLRs and the MAVS adaptor in the case of RLRs ( Akira et al . , 2006 ; Barton and Kagan , 2009 ) . Interestingly , when considering these two networks , the function of diversifying signaling locale appears to be distinct . In the case of TLRs , differ - ential receptor placement diversiﬁes the types of pathogens that can be detected : TLRs found on endosomes recognize viruses , while TLRs found on the plasma membrane typically recognize bacteria . In contrast , differential MAVS placement does not diversify the types of viruses detected by RLRs , but diversiﬁes the types of signaling pathways that are activated . In the case of reovirus and inﬂuenza virus infection of ﬁbroblasts , peroxi - somal MAVS triggers the rapid expression of ISGs , whereas mitochondrial MAVS triggers delayed ISG and IFN expression . This diversiﬁcation is functionally important , as our data indicate that MAVS signaling must occur from both organelles to limit reovirus replication . Our studies revealed another important similarity between the RLR and TLR networks , that of cell type - speciﬁc functions for adaptor proteins . In ﬁbroblasts , MAVS functioned to induce expression of IFNs and ISGs , but not inﬂammatory cytokines . In contrast , IFNs , ISGs , and cytokines were all induced by MAVS signaling in macrophages . Thus , MAVS can be grouped with the TLR adaptor MyD88 as immune regulators that induce cell type - speciﬁc transcriptional responses . What is the beneﬁt of cell type - speciﬁc actions of innate immune signaling path - ways ? One beneﬁt may lie in the primary functions of the cells responding to a given virus . For example , macrophages are dedicated sentinels of the innate immune system . As such , within these cells , infection triggers MAVS - dependent inﬂamma - tory cytokine production and antiviral factors . Fibroblasts , in contrast , are tissue - resident cells that are primarily involved in organ homeostasis—a condition that is disrupted under inﬂam - matory conditions . Thus , designing MAVS to induce antiviral factors but not inﬂammatory cytokines in ﬁbroblasts may aid these cells in maintaining homeostasis under infectious condi - tions . We speculate that the diversiﬁcation of adaptor functions in innate immunity may be a general mechanism to tailor signal - ing pathways to the needs of functionally diverse cell types . Our ﬁnding that peroxisomal localization of MAVS is required for rapid but transient induction of antiviral ISGs whereas mito - chondrial MAVS promotes ISG expression with delayed kinetics in ﬁbroblasts is especially intriguing . The kinetic differences of ISG expression were explained by the observation that peroxi - somal MAVS induced a cell - intrinsic means of ISG induction , which occurred in the absence of detectable IFN expression . Mitochondrial MAVS induced cell - intrinsic ISG expression as well , but maximal induction occurred through the actions of secreted IFNs . Our studies did not reveal an obvious difference in the downstream regulators activated by peroxisomal versus mitochondrial MAVS , but the studies performed in 293T cells suggest that the selective positioning of negative regulators ( e . g . , NLRX1 ) may contribute to organelle - speciﬁc responses . Future work will be required to address this point . The functional importance of RLR signaling from peroxi - somes was best revealed by experiments with VSV , which interferes with IFN expression and renders the mitochondrial pathway ineffective . As a result , even though MAVS is present on mitochondria and peroxisomes in WT cells , a functional anti - viral response against VSV is only induced by the peroxisomal pathway . We also exploited VSV infection to dissect the perox - isomal signaling pathway using cells derived from genetically - deﬁcient mice . While we found that IRF3 plays a role in ISG expression , this factor is also involved in the regulation of IFN expression ( Sato et al . , 2000 ) and may therefore be considered a more general regulator of antiviral gene expression . Indeed IRF3 is also involved in IFN expression induced by non - RLRs ( Kawai and Akira , 2007 ) . IRF1 , on the other hand , is needed for expression of all ISGs that we examined in VSV - infected cells and is not required for IFN expression ( Tamura et al . , 2008 ) . IRF1 may thus uniquely control IFN - independent signaling events that lead to ISG expression and antiviral immu - nity . Our experiments with VSV also revealed a probable beneﬁt of utilizing both IFN - dependent and IFN - independent mecha - nisms of ISG induction : for pathogens that disrupt the Cell 141 , 668 – 681 , May 14 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 677 A B E C WT Pex Mito Cyto 0 200 400 600 800 0 h 3 h 16 h I f n a4 t r a n sc r i p t c oun t WT Pex Mito Cyto 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 0 h 3 h 16 h I f nb 1 t r a n sc r i p t c oun t D WT Pex Mito Cyto 0 5000 10000 15000 0 h 3 h 16 h A 20 t r a n sc r i p t c oun t WT Pex Mito Cyto 0 20000 40000 60000 0 h 3 h 16 h C c l 4 t r a n sc r i p t c oun t WT Pex Mito Cyto 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 h 3 h 16 h I l 1 b t r a n sc r i p t c oun t WT Pex Mito Cyto 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 0 h 3 h 16 h C xc l 2 t r a n sc r i p t c oun t WT Pex Mito Cyto 0 10000 20000 30000 0 h 3 h 16 h C o x - 2 t r a n sc r i p t c oun t WT Pex Mito Cyto 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 0 h 3 h 16 h Fo s t r a n sc r i p t c oun t 0 10 20 30 40 0 2 4 6 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 0 2000 4000 6000 t r a n sc r i p t c oun t t r a n sc r i p t c oun t t r a n sc r i p t f o l d c h a ng e t r a n sc r i p t f o l d c h a ng e Ifit1 Oas1g Ifit1 Oas1g Viperin Viperin Ifit2 Ifit2 IRF7 IRF7 WTIRF1 KO IRF3 KO IRF5 KO WTIRF1 KO IRF3 KO IRF5 KO WTIRF1 KO IRF3 KO IRF5 KO WTIRF1 KO IRF3 KO IRF5 KO 678 Cell 141 , 668 – 681 , May 14 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . expression of IFNs , the peroxisomal pathway retains the ability to induce ISGs and create a functional , albeit temporary , anti - viral state . In ﬁbroblasts , the cooperative actions of MAVS on peroxi - somes and mitochondria are needed for maximal antiviral immu - nity , and signaling from each organelle occurs independently of the other . As such , it appears that a simple mathematical equa - tion can be proposed to explain antiviral signal transduction : RLR = Pex + Mito ( Figure 7E ) . If either term in this equation is removed , then the RLR signaling network operates inefﬁciently , and antiviral immunity is compromised . We note however , that maximal ISG and IFN expression requires signaling from both organelles , which likely indicates that crosstalk exists to allow the two pathways to be properly integrated . In closing , our studies establish a new function for peroxi - somes , that of a subcellular compartment that promotes a rapid response to viral infection . We speculate that additional organ - elles may harbor pathogen detection systems , and our work pro - vides a mandate to expand the search for these organelles .

( CandD ) ImmortalizedMAVS - KOmacrophageswereretrovirallytransducedwithMAVS - WT , - Pex , - Mito , and - Cytofor48hr . Thetransductionefﬁciencyofeach cell population was determined to be20 % – 30 % as assessed by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Cells were infected withreovirus and at the indicated times and were harvested , and RNA was analyzed for expression of type I IFN ( C ) and other inﬂammatory genes ( D ) with nCounter . See also Figure S5 . ( E ) Model of organelle speciﬁc MAVS signaling in ﬁbroblasts . Peroxisomal MAVS is essential for rapid ISG expression independent of type I IFN , whereas mito - chondrial MAVS induces ISGs with delayed kinetics and primarily dependent on type I IFN secretion . Therefore , peroxisomal MAVS mediates immediate and transient antiviral effects , while mitochondrial MAVS promotes a sustained response later during infection . See also Figure S5 .

Fourthousand eighty - ninegenes passed both criteria for at least one of the assayed conditions . Samples are clusteredbasedonthePearson’scorrelation coefﬁcientfortheproﬁleofthose 4089 genes . The Pearson correlation , hierarchical clustering , and heat map were generated with the R functions ‘‘cor , ’’ ‘‘hclust , ’’ and ‘‘heatmap , ’’ respec - tively . Signal intensity that reﬂected mRNA expression was presented on heat maps or scatterplots on a log scale according to a color - coded intensity scale withRsoftware ( TheRProjectforStatisticalComputing ) . Eachdatapointinthe scatterplots presented indicates a gene whose expression level exhibited a change > 2 - fold . mRNA Detection and Analysis with nCounter nCounter CodeSets were constructed to detect genes selected by the Gene - Selector algorithm and additional controls as described . Two hundred and forty thousand cells were lysed in RLT buffer ( QIAGEN ) supplemented with b - mercaptoethanol . Five percent of the lysate was hybridized for 16 hr with the CodeSet and loaded onto the nCounter prep station , followed by quantiﬁ - cation with the nCounter Digital Analyzer . To allow for side - by - side compari - sons of nCounter experiments , we normalized the nCounter data in two steps . We ﬁrst controlled for small variations in the efﬁciency of processing by normalizing measurements from all samples analyzed on a given run to the levels of chosen positive controls provided by the nCounter instrument . Second , we normalized the data obtained for each sample to the expression of nine control genes ( Gapdh , Ik , Mea1 , Ndufs5 , Ndufa7 , Rbm6 , Shfm1 , Tomm7 , and Ywhaz ) . These genes were described to be unchanged in cells exposed to a variety of infectious conditions ( Amit et al . , 2009 ) . For every sample , we computed the weighted average of the mRNA counts of the nine control transcripts and normalized the sample’s values by multiplying each transcript count by the weighted average of the controls .

Vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , an enveloped virus with bullet - shaped virions that measure 70 6 200 nm , enters cells by clathrin - dependent endocytosis . We showed previously that VSV particles exceed the capacity of typical clathrin - coated vesicles and instead enter through endocytic carriers that acquire a partial clathrin coat and require local actin filament assembly to complete vesicle budding and internalization . To understand why the actin system is required for VSV uptake , we compared the internalization mechanisms of VSV and its shorter ( 75 nm long ) defective interfering particle , DI - T . By imaging the uptake of individual particles into live cells , we found that , as with parental virions , DI - T enters via the clathrin endocytic pathway . Unlike VSV , DI - T internalization occurs through complete clathrin - coated vesicles and does not require actin polymerization . Since VSV and DI - T particles display similar surface densities of the same attachment glycoprotein , we conclude that the physical properties of the particle dictate whether a virus - containing clathrin pit engages the actin system . We suggest that the elongated shape of a VSV particle prevents full enclosure by the clathrin coat and that stalling of coat assembly triggers recruitment of the actin machinery to finish the internalization process . Since some enveloped viruses have pleomorphic particle shapes and sizes , our work suggests that they may use altered modes of endocytic uptake . More generally , our findings show the importance of cargo geometry for specifying cellular entry modes , even when the receptor recognition properties of a ligand are maintained .

The most prominent and well - characterized endocytic carriers are clathrin - coated vesicles ( reviewed in [ 1 – 3 ] ) . Coated vesicles transport lipids , proteins , and other essential macromolecules from the cell surface to endosomal organelles . Extensive biochemical and cell biological research supports the following model for conventional coated vesicle formation in higher eukaryotes . The AP - 2 clathrin adaptor complex recruits clathrin to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane and sequesters cargos at the endocytic site [ 4 , 5 ] . The continued assembly of clathrin into a lattice - like configuration helps deform the underlying membrane and ultimately creates an invagination , or ‘pit’ [ 2 ] . Recruitment of the GTPase , dynamin , then facilitates scission of the coated pit from the plasma membrane [ 6 ] , and clathrin is rapidly removed from the cargo - loaded vesicle by the combined action of the heat shock cognate protein 70 ( Hsc70 ) and its co - chaperone auxilin [ 7 , 8 ] . The entire process is typically complete within 30 – 60 s [ 9 , 10 ] . Coated pits incorporate and internalize soluble cargos of various sizes , such as transferrin ( 5 nm ) [ 9 , 11 ] and low density lipoproteins ( 25 nm ) [ 9 , 12 ] . Many viruses and intracellular bacteria are also internalized by the clathrin machinery [ 9 , 13 – 16 ] . We previously evaluated how cells internalize the 70 6 200 nm bullet - shaped vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) . We found that VSV internalization occurs through elongated , partially clathrin - coated structures that have longer lifetimes ( , 2 min . ) than typical endocytic clathrin - coated vesicles and require local actin polymerization for uptake [ 15 ] . During VSV internalization , the clathrin coat first assembles as a partially closed dome at one end of the virion [ 15 , 17 ] , and growth of the coat stalls when it encounters the long particle axis . Actin assembly then drives one or more late stage ( s ) of the internalization process , as recruitment of the actin machinery peaks during completion of clathrin assembly , and pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization blocks VSV internalization without interfering with clathrin coat assembly [ 15 ] . Relatively small , spherical viruses like dengue virus ( 50 nm ) [ 13 ] and some influenza A viruses ( X - 31 strain , , 120 nm ) [ 14 , 18 ] also enter using a clathrin - dependent route , but it is unclear whether actin function is required for their uptake . Our observations with VSV led us to PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 1 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 hypothesize that the physical dimensions of the virion block the ongoing polymerization of clathrin during its uptake , and that the stalled structure recruits regulators of actin assembly whose activity is required to complete the internalization process . Defective interfering ( DI ) particles arise spontaneously during virus replication . Such particles depend upon coinfecting helper virus to support their replication but contain all the essential cis - acting regulatory elements for genome replication and assembly . One such well - characterized DI particle of VSV is termed DI - T , which lacks 82 % of the viral genome [ 19 , 20 ] . Since the length of a VSV particle is dictated by the genome size [ 21 ] , DI - T particles are 75 nm long and appear as truncated bullets by electron microscopy [ 22 ] . DI - T particles contain normal proportions of the viral structural proteins [ 23 ] , including the viral surface glycopro - tein ( G ) , which mediates VSV attachment and entry into host cells . Here we took advantage of significant differences in the physical dimensions of VSV and DI - T to investigate how the geometry of a viral cargo influences the actin - dependency of clathrin internal - ization . Using live cell fluorescence microscopic imaging , we compared the uptake mechanisms of VSV and DI - T at the single particle level . We report that in contrast to the clathrin - and actin - dependent uptake of VSV , the shorter DI - T particles enter cells through fully coated clathrin carriers that do not require actin dynamics for vesicle budding . These observations highlight the plasticity of the clathrin endocytic system , where clathrin coats serve as a scaffold to direct actin assembly when the clathrin machinery alone is not sufficient to mediate internalization . Results Biological properties of DI - T particles To generate a clonal population of VSV DI - T particles , we recovered DI - T from cDNA ( Figure 1A ) [ 24 ] and amplified the particles by co - infection of cells with VSV [ 25 ] . We separated DI - T particles from VSV by rate zonal centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient . Electron microscopic analysis ( Figure 1B , C ) confirmed that VSV virions measure 70 + / 2 8 nm by 204 + / 2 14 nm ( n = 114 ) [ 21 ] , while the shorter DI - T particles have a length of 76 + / 2 8 nm ( n = 81 ) [ 22 ] . DI - T particles , like VSV , are covered with spike - like projections that correspond to homotrimers of G protein ( Figure 1B ) , and SDS - PAGE analysis of purified particles confirmed that VSV and DI - T particles contain similar ratios of G protein to core virion components ( Figure 1D ) [ 23 ] . The purified stocks of DI - T lacked full - length virions ( Figure 1B ) , with only a single VSV virion observed amongst more than 3 , 000 DI - T particles . Limited dilutions of the purified DI - T stock contained , 1x10 6 plaque forming units of virus per microgram of total viral protein , or 10 - 5 times fewer infectious particles than for an equivalent protein quantity of VSV particles ( not shown ) . Thus , we have successfully purified relatively homogeneous populations of VSV and DI - T particles , which differ only in their physical dimensions . DI - T particles enter cells by clathrin - dependent endocytosis To visualize VSV and DI - T by fluorescence microscopy , we covalently labeled the G proteins with spectrally separable fluorescent dye molecules ( Alexa Fluor 568 and 647 , respectively ) using conditions that do not reduce viral infectivity [ 15 ] . Spinning disk confocal images of labeled particles adsorbed onto glass coverslips showed diffraction - limited objects with single - peaked distributions of fluorescence intensity values ( Figure 1E ) , indicating that the DI - T and VSV populations primarily consist of individual particles [ 15 ] . We tracked the entry of DI - T particles into BSC1 cells stably expressing an eGFP - tagged s 2 subunit of the AP - 2 adaptor complex ( s 2 - eGFP ) , which incorporates into all clathrin - coated structures that form on the plasma membrane [ 9 , 15 , 26 ] . Single DI - T particles readily attached to cells and progressed through the following set of defined events ( see Figures 2A , B ; Video S1 for examples ) : ( 1 ) membrane - bound DI - T particles diffused slowly ( D = 5 6 10 2 11 – 5 6 10 2 12 cm 2 s 2 1 ) and with the random directionality characteristic of Brownian motion ; ( 2 ) shortly after DI - T attachment , a dim spot of AP - 2 signal arose and remained colocalized with the particle , signifying incorporation of DI - T into an assembling clathrin - coated pit ; ( 3 ) the AP - 2 signal steadily increased over time until it peaked as coat assembly completed , and the DI - T particle then underwent an abrupt movement into the cell , after which the AP - 2 signal disappeared due to clathrin uncoating . This sequence of events is identical to what we previously observed for VSV entering cells by clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 15 ] . Moreover , the efficiency of DI - T uptake via the clathrin pathway is similar to that of the full - length VSV particles , as 89 % ( 55 / 62 ) of DI - T particles that attached to 3 individual cells during imaging entered by clathrin - dependent endocytosis . These data show that DI - T efficiently enters cells through the clathrin pathway and validate the use of DI - T and VSV as comparative endocytic cargos . Clathrin structures capture VSV and DI - T particles with similar kinetics To directly compare how DI - T and VSV particles engage the clathrin machinery , we simultaneously inoculated BSC1 cells with the two spectrally distinct particle forms and then analyzed their mode of incorporation into AP - 2 containing clathrin structures on a single cell basis ( Figure 2C ) . For each complete virus uptake event , we quantified the kinetics of particle capture by measuring the elapsed time between virion attachment and the appearance of an AP - 2 signal that colocalized with the bound particle . The capture time for DI - T particles was 110 + / 2 80 s ( n = 121 ) , which is statistically indistinguishable ( Student’s t - test , p = 0 . 2 ) to that measured for VSV ( 130 + / 2 125 s ( n = 87 ) ) and agrees well with our prior measurements ( Figure 2D ) [ 15 ] . The AP - 2 structures that captured DI - T or VSV initiated within a , 250 nm zone ( the resolution limit of the optical system ) of the attached particle . We therefore conclude that DI - T and VSV particles engage the clathrin system in an indistinguishable manner , which likely reflects a shared mechanism triggered by the same viral glycoprotein - receptor interactions . Author Summary We present a detailed comparison between the clathrin - dependent entry mechanisms of a parental virus ( VSV ) and its smaller defective interfering particle ( DI - T ) . We used the difference in virion length to probe why actin assembly is required for the uptake of full - length VSV particles by nonpolarized mammalian cells . By imaging the entry of single particles in an unbiased manner , we resolved differences in the maturation kinetics , clathrin content , and actin dependency of clathrin endocytic structures internalizing VSV or DI - T virions . Our principal finding is that , unlike VSV uptake , DI - T internalization does not induce or require robust actin polymerization . We have also established , for the first time , that the geometry of an endocytic cargo can alter the mechanism of clathrin uptake . We propose that VSV - containing clathrin struc - tures display characteristics of ‘frustrated’ endocytic intermediates that cells resolve by using the force of actin assembly to deform the plasma membrane into a complete endocytic vesicle . Virus Length Alters Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 2 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 Cells internalize DI - T particles using conventional clathrin - coated vesicles To investigate the characteristics of the clathrin coat responsible for DI - T internalization , we imaged the uptake of both particle forms by the same BSC1 cell . We found that DI - T particles are internalized through AP - 2 containing structures significantly faster than full - length virions ( Figure 3A , B ; Video S2 ) . Quantitative analysis of data compiled from 4 cells showed that pits incorporating DI - T ( n = 36 ) form in 43 + / 2 14 s , which is similar to the assembly kinetics of pits that lack virus particles ( n = 212 , 35 + / 2 10 s ) ( Figure 3C , Table 1 ) . As expected , AP - 2 structures that capture VSV ( n = 29 ) require longer ( 75 + / 2 22 s ) to complete ( Figure 3C , Table 1 ) . A similar analysis conducted in cells transiently expressing eGFP - tagged clathrin light chain A1 ( eGFP - LCa ) yielded analogous results ( Figure 3D , E , Table 1 , Videos S3 , S4 ) . The interaction of full - length VSV with a cell had no impact on the uptake kinetics of DI - T into the same cell ( Table 1 ) . The different kinetics of DI - T versus VSV internalization suggests that DI - T enters cells through conventional fully coated clathrin structures and not the partially coated vesicles responsible for VSV uptake . To further investigate this possibility , we measured the maximum fluorescent signal of eGFP - tagged AP - 2 or clathrin molecules , as this peak signal is known to be proportional to the overall size of a clathrin coat [ 9 , 15 , 26 ] . We compared this value for structures that contained DI - T with those that contained VSV or lacked either particle . Similar quantities of coat components were present in structures associated with DI - T to those lacking viral particles ( Figure 3C , E , Table 1 ) . As expected , VSV - containing structures accumulate more AP - 2 and LCa molecules than structures lacking virus ( Figure 3C , E , Table 1 ) . Taken together , the above experiments suggest that DI - T enters cells through pits that acquire a full clathrin coat . Consistent with this , electron micrographs of DI - T particles captured during cell entry show particles present in circular pits entirely surrounded by a clathrin coat ( Figure 4A ) . This is in marked contrast to the partial clathrin coat found at one end of the endocytic carriers that internalize VSV ( Figure 4B ) [ 15 ] . Clathrin structures containing VSV recruit more cortactin that pits that internalize DI - T During the final phase of coat assembly , endocytic clathrin structures associated with VSV show a strong recruitment of cortactin , an F - actin and dynamin binding protein that activates Arp2 / 3 - mediated assembly of branched actin filaments [ 15 , 27 , 28 ] . To determine whether DI - T uptake is associated with an acute recruitment of cortactin , we monitored internalization Figure 1 . Biological properties of DI - T particles .

As previously shown [ 15 , 26 , 29 ] , conventional clathrin - coated pits exhibit minimal cortactin recruitment that typically peaks just before completion of clathrin assembly ( Figure 5A , Video S5 ) . Cortactin recruitment is similarly sparse during the uptake of DI - T particles ( Figure 5B , Video S6 ) . In marked contrast , and as expected [ 15 ] , large bursts of cortactin accompany the internalization of VSV ( Figure 5C , Video S7 ) . Quantitative analysis revealed that the peak fluorescence intensity of cortactin detected in the late phase of VSV uptake averaged 3 - fold higher than the signal associated with pits containing DI - T or pits that did not capture a virus particle ( Figure 5D , Table 1 ) . These data suggest that while formation of short - branched actin filaments is required during the late stages of clathrin - mediated VSV entry , this need is obviated during clathrin - dependent DI - T entry . Actin polymerization is not required for DI - T internalization To directly test whether actin assembly is required for DI - T entry , we treated BSC1 cells with latrunculin B ( latB ) , a chemical inhibitor of actin filament assembly [ 30 ] , and tracked the endocytic fate of DI - T and VSV in the same cells . Treatment of cells with 6 . 3 m M latB did not change the efficiency of DI - T entry ( Figure 6A – C , Video S8 ) , but it reduced the internalization of VSV by . 75 % ( Figure 6A – C ) . As expected [ 15 ] , latB treatment did not affect the capture efficiency of either particle type by clathrin ( Figure 6C ) . The lifetimes and AP - 2 content of pits lacking particles or containing DI - T was similarly unaffected by latB ( Figure 6D ) . We conclude that the shorter DI - T particles bypass the actin requirement displayed by the larger VSV for efficient clathrin - based uptake . Figure 2 . Clathrin structures capture VSV and DI - T particles with similar kinetics . ( A ) Schematic of clathrin - dependent virus internalization . 1 . A particle ( blue ) attaches to receptor moieties ( orange ) on the cell surface ( black horizontal line ) , and the virus - receptor complex diffuses in the plane of the membrane . 2 . The virus particle is captured by the clathrin endocytic machinery ( AP - 2 , green ; clathrin , red ) after diffusion into an existing clathrin structure ( e . g . Dengue virus ) or entrapment within a clathrin structure that initiates in close proximity to the virion ( e . g . VSV and influenza A virus ) . 3 . Clathrin assembly completes , and the virus - containing pit is severed from the cell surface in a dynamin - dependent process . Internalization of VSV also requires local actin assembly . Clathrin is rapidly removed from the nascent vesicle , and the vesicle is actively transported further into cell . ( B ) Example of a complete DI - T internalization event . A single DI - T particle ( red ) attaches to a BSC1 cell expressing s 2 - eGFP ( green ) and diffuses on the cell surface . A dim spot of AP - 2 appears beneath the virion , signifying capture of the particle . The AP - 2 fluorescence intensity increases as the clathrin coat assembles , and the virus disappears into the cell shortly after the AP - 2 signal reaches a maximum ( Video S1 ) . Numbered stages correspond to the events described in A . The path of particle motion is depicted as a linear , color - coded trace that progresses with time from blue to red .

The kinetics of VSV and DI - T capture are not significantly different ( Student’s t - test p value = 0 . 2 ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1001127 . g002 Virus Length Alters Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 4 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 Discussion The major conclusion of our study is that the physical properties of a virus particle dictate the need for engagement of the actin system during its clathrin - dependent uptake into cells . We formulate this conclusion based on tracking the clathrin - depen - dent internalization of VSV and its shorter DI - T particle into live cells . Internalization of VSV is accompanied by the recruitment of Figure 3 . Cells internalize DI - T particles using conventional clathrin - coated vesicles . ( A ) Internalization of VSV and DI - T by the same cell . BSC1 cells stably expressing s 2 - eGFP ( green ) were inoculated with VSV ( red ) and DI - T ( blue ) particles , and confocal images were captured at 4 s intervals . The images show the sequential internalization of single VSV ( red , red arrowheads ) and DI - T ( blue , blue arrowheads ) particles , followed by the formation of a canonical coated vesicle ( white arrowhead ) within a 3 . 5 6 3 . 5 m m 2 area of the plasma membrane ( Video S2 ) .

The plots show the relative lifetime ( left ) and maximum fluorescence intensity ( right ) of AP - 2 during the uptake of coated pits lacking virus ( pits , black ) or structures that internalized DI - T ( blue ) or VSV ( red ) particles ( from 4 cells ) . Values are expressed as percentages to facilitate comparison of viral and nonviral uptake events across multiple cells . Approximately 50 pits lacking virus were analyzed in each cell , and the mean of the measured values was calculated for each parameter . The values for each nonviral and viral uptake event were divided by the mean for pits lacking virus in the same cell , and the resulting values were multiplied by 100 .

By contrast , internalization of the shorter DI - T particles is insensitive to chemical inhibition of actin polymerization and is not accompanied by the same spike of cortactin recruitment observed for the full - length VSV particles . VSV and DI - T particles differ in their length and not the density of the glycoprotein spike that dictates their entry . We suggest that the shape of the full - length VSV particles presents a physical barrier that frustrates completion of the clathrin - coated pit . The stalled clathrin structure then recruits the actin machinery required to finalize internalization . The shorter DI - T particles no longer provide such a physical barrier during engulfment , which results in their actin - independent internalization through coated vesicles that acquire a full complement of clathrin . The importance of particle length for the clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV Receptor - dependent signaling events lead to actin filament assembly during the clathrin - independent uptake of other viruses , including poliovirus and coxsackie B virus [ 31 , 32 ] . Here we show that the initial interactions of DI - T with the cell are indistinguish - able to those of VSV , as both particle types diffuse slowly on the cell surface and are captured by coated pits with similar kinetics ( Figure 2 ) . Such similar behavior suggests that DI - T and VSV engage an as yet unknown viral receptor in an analogous manner . Since initial receptor interactions appear indistinguishable , it seems remote that VSV G - receptor interactions induce a signaling cascade that leads to actin polymerization at sites of VSV but not DI - T uptake . We therefore conclude that the glycoprotein is not the primary trigger of actin assembly during clathrin - dependent VSV internalization . We previously showed that endocytic structures containing VSV do not acquire a full clathrin coat [ 15 ] , which agreed with earlier electron micrographs depicting virus particles in tubular invagi - nations with clathrin at the cytosolic tip [ 17 ] . The morphology of those structures suggests that cells initially capture one tip of the virus particle , and clathrin assembly stalls when the constricting coat encounters the long axis of the virion ( Figure 7 ) . Here we found that DI - T particles do not alter the process of clathrin - coated vesicle formation ( Figures 3 , 4 ) . This finding implies that clathrin can fully enclose cargos displaying VSV G provided that the particle shape does not physically prohibit clathrin assembly or closure of the plasma membrane ( Figure 7 ) . Consequently , the physical properties of the VSV particle captured by a clathrin - coated pit are what dictate the altered mode of actin - dependent uptake . We therefore propose the model ( Figure 7 ) that it is the incomplete clathrin structure formed during VSV uptake that elicits the actin - based response to rescue the endocytic process and leads to the successful engulfment of the trapped virus particle . Actin - dependent clathrin - mediated endocytosis The importance of actin function during clathrin - mediated endocytosis varies . In yeast cells , actin polymerization drives invagination and endocytosis of long - lived ( . 2 min . ) clathrin assemblies through tubular intermediates with clathrin at the cytosolic tip [ 33 – 35 ] . Mammalian cells also form large ( 0 . 2 – 1 m m ) , relatively flat arrays of clathrin , or ‘plaques , ’ on the adherent cell surface [ 26 , 36 ] . These structures also exhibit long lifetimes ( 2 - 15 + min . ) and require local actin assembly for internalization [ 26 ] . Coated pit internalization from the apical ( but not the basolateral ) surface of polarized mammalian cells [ 37 , 38 ] and lamprey neuronal synapses [ 39 , 40 ] is also actin - dependent . By contrast , actin polymerization is only required for the uptake of clathrin Table 1 . Summary of kinetic and fluorescence intensity data .

Thus , while actin dynamics play an evolutionarily conserved role in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , mammalian cells regulate the interplay between the clathrin and actin systems . Our analyses of VSV and coated plaque internalization reveal two properties that correlate with their actin - dependent uptake mechanisms . First , plaques and VSV - containing structures remain on the plasma membrane for . 2 - fold longer than standard coated pits [ 15 , 26 ] ( Figure 3C , E ) . The prolonged presence of a clathrin lattice might promote interactions between clathrin - associated proteins and regulators of actin polymerization . Second , clathrin plaques and VSV - containing structures physically differ from standard coated pits . Plaques fail to constrict their outer boundaries during the final phase of clathrin assembly [ 26 ] , and pits containing VSV lack a complete clathrin coat [ 15 , 17 ] . Such unusual structural features might attract proteins that associate with exposed lipids , such as dynamin . Indeed , significantly more dynamin molecules accumulate during the final stages of VSV uptake [ 15 ] . This localized increase in dynamin may enhance the recruitment of dynamin - interacting proteins with the capacity to bind lipids and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex through N - WASP , including endophilin , syndapin , and SNX9 [ 42 – 46 ] . Although these proteins may link the clathrin and actin systems and facilitate localized membrane remodeling during endocytosis ( reviewed in [ 47 ] ) , further studies are needed to determine whether they play a role in clathrin - dependent VSV endocytosis . Comparative studies of VSV and DI - T uptake may provide a useful tool to dissect the mechanisms that regulate actin assembly during clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Implications for the internalization mechanisms of other viruses The dimensions of the actin - dependent VSV particle and the actin - independent DI - T particle fall within the range of shapes present in many pleomorphic viruses . Our work suggests that this may lead to important distinctions in their mode of uptake . For example , some influenza A virus strains , such as X - 31 , produce spherical particles that measure 80 – 120 nm in diameter [ 18 ] . By contrast , the Udorn strain forms filamentous particles that measure 80 – 100 nm wide and up to 30 microns in length [ 48 , 49 ] . Although influenza A virus can enter cells by clathrin - dependent and - independent mechanisms [ 14 ] , the impact of particle shape on the entry pathway remains unknown . It seems likely that remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton will be important for uptake of filamentous influenza particles , and clathrin may facilitate local membrane deformation during the endocytic process . The Arenaviridae generate roughly spherical particles that range in diameter from 40 – 300 nm [ 50 , 51 ] , and it is known that clathrin function is important for efficient infection of cells by some New World arenaviruses [ 52 ] . It will now be of interest to determine whether spherical particles of different diameter employ altered modes of clathrin - based endocytosis . Pseudotyping is often used to study the entry pathway of highly pathogenic viruses , including the long filamentous filoviruses , Ebola and Marburg , as well as several arenaviruses . Such pseudotypes are frequently based on VSV or retroviral virions in which the endogenous entry proteins have been replaced with the surface glycoproteins of the pathogenic virus [ 53 – 56 ] . Although viral pseudotypes are useful for studying the entry process , VSV and the spherical virions of retroviruses ( , 100 nm in diameter ) do not accurately recapitulate the sizes or shapes of the pleomorphic viruses . Our studies of VSV and DI - T clearly show that virion geometry can fundamentally alter aspects of the viral internaliza - tion process . Therefore , it is critically important to study viral endocytosis using pseudotyped or virus - like particles that closely approximate the physical properties of a virus in question .

Dye conjugation to virus particles Purified DI - T and VSV particles were labeled with Alexa Fluor dye molecules ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) as previously described [ 15 ] except that the final dye concentration in the labeling reaction was reduced to 25 m g ml 2 1 . Plaque assays of virus preps before and after labeling showed that dye conjugation did not affect the infectivity of VSV particles or the capacity of DI - T virions to inhibit plaque formation by VSV . The surface density of G protein on VSV or DI - T particles was estimated by measuring the ratio of G protein to N protein in each particle population . To separate and visualize the viral proteins , purified virions were subjected to SDS - PAGE using 10 % polyacrylamide and 0 . 13 % bis - acrylamide and stained with Coomassie blue . The relative amounts of N or G protein were established using ImageJ ( U . S . National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland ; http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Nucleic acid transfection BSC1 cells were seeded into 6 - well plates at , 60 , 000 cells per well 16 – 20 h prior to transfection . Plasmid DNA was introduced into the cells using FuGENE 6 ( Roche Diagnostics ; Indianapolis , Figure 5 . Clathrin structures containing VSV recruit more cortactin that pits that internalize DI - T .

Prior to trans - fection , media on the cells was replaced with 1 ml OPTIMEM ( Invitrogen ) . After addition of the transfection mixture , cells were incubated at 37 u C for 5 h , and the existing media was supplemented with 2 ml DMEM containing 10 % FBS . To ensure optimal replacement of endogenous clathrin light chain molecules with rat eGFP - clathrin light chain A1 ( eGFP - LCa ) [ 9 ] , cells were transfected with 0 . 75 m g of plasmid DNA encoding eGFP - LCa . The cells were cultured for , 36 h and seeded onto glass coverslips , 14 h prior to image acquisition . Co - expression of mCherry - LCa ( constructed as described for tomato - LCa [ 8 ] ) and mouse cortactin - eGFP [ 57 , 58 ] was achieved by transfection of cells on glass coverslips with 1 m g of each plasmid , and the cells were imaged , 18 h later . Figure 6 . Actin polymerization is not required for DI - T internalization . ( A ) The endocytic fate of virus particles after inhibition of actin polymerization . BSC1 cells stably expressing s 2 - eGFP ( green ) were treated with 6 . 3 m M latB for 12 min . and inoculated with DI - T and VSV particles in the continued presence of latB . Time - lapse images of a single cell were acquired at 4 s intervals for 692 s , and an 8 . 8 6 5 . 0 m m 2 area of the cell surface is shown . The upper panels show the complete internalization of a DI - T particle ( blue , blue arrowheads ) , where + 0 s indicates the first frame of the time - lapse series .

Note that the adaptor fluorescence associated with the DI - T particle ( blue ) and a conventional coated pit ( black ) that formed within the same membrane area peak and disappear normally , while the adaptor signal associated with the upper - most VSV particle ( red ) does not , signifying failed internalization .

Left , relative lifetime of AP - 2 in structures that lack ( pits , black ) or capture a virus particle . Inset shows a rescaled distribution of the pit and DI - T internalization events . Right , maximum fluorescence intensity of AP - 2 in the events at left . Data are from 4 of the 5 cells analyzed in C , as thermal drift during imaging prevented accurate fluorescence intensity measurements in one cell . The number of events in each category is shown above the corresponding plots at right . DI - T ( blue ) data consists only of productive internalization events . VSV events are categorized as productive internalizations ( VSV entry , red ) or non - productive captures ( trapped VSV , red ) . A non - productive capture is defined as a stable colocalization between a spot of AP - 2 and a VSV particle that began at least 300 s before the last captured image and did not result in virus uptake before cessation of imaging . The 300 s cutoff was chosen because a majority ( 22 / 24 ) of productive internalizations occurred within 300 s of capture . Captures in which the final image frame was acquired before 300 s elapsed were excluded from the analysis , as the eventual endocytic fate of the particle cannot be predicted . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1001127 . g006 Virus Length Alters Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 9 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 Live cell imaging Cells on 25 mm coverslips ( No . 1 . 5 , Electron Microscopy Sciences ; Hatfield , PA ) were placed into a perfusion chamber and overlaid with a - MEM lacking phenol red ( Invitrogen ) and supplemented with 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 and 2 % FBS . The chamber was placed in a heated sample holder ( 20 / 20 Technology Inc . ; Wilmington , NC ) mounted on the stage of a Mariana imaging system ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO ) based on an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ; Thornwood , NY ) . The microscope stage and objective lenses were maintained at 37 u C within an environmental chamber , and the air above the cells was supplied with 5 % CO 2 . The position of the sample holder with respect to the objective lens was manipulated using a PZ - 2000 automated stage ( Applied Scientific Instrumen - tation ; Eugene , OR ) . Samples were illuminated using 40 – 50 mW solid state lasers ( l = 488 , Coherent , Inc . ; Santa Clara , CA , l = 561 , Cobolt AB ; Solna , Sweden , l = 640 , 40 mW ; Coherent ) directed through an acousto - optic tunable filter ( AOTF ; Gooch and Housego L . L . C . ; Melbourne , FL ) . Laser illumination was imparted on the sample through a CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal unit ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation ; Tokyo , Japan ) and a 63X objective lens ( Plan - Apochromat , NA 1 . 4 , Carl Zeiss ) . Emission spectra were selected using single band width emission filters ( LF405 / 488 / 561 / 635 - A , Semrock ; Rochester , NY ) , and after transmission through a spherical aberration correction device ( Infinity Photo - Optical ; Boulder , CO ) , the emission photons were collected using a Cascade II : 512B back - illuminated EMCCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Photometrics ; Tuscon , AZ ) . Under this configuration , a single pixel corresponds to 0 . 07 6 0 . 07 m m 2 . Slidebook 4 . 2 . 13 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Inc . ( III ) ; Denver , CO ) was used to command the hardware devices and visualize the acquired data . To image virus internalization , Alexa - labeled virus was centrifuged briefly to remove aggregates , and cells were inoculated with virus to result in attachment of , 50 particles per cell within 20 min . ( , 1 6 10 7 p . f . u . of VSV , , MOI 100 , 0 . 005 – 0 . 05 particles per m m 2 of cell surface area ) . Time - lapse acquisitions were typically carried out for 8 – 10 min . per cell , and images were captured at 3 – 4 s intervals after sequentially illuminating the sample with the appropriate laser for 50 – 100 ms per wavelength . To assess the effect of latrunculin B ( latB ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , Inc . ; St . Louis , MO ) on coated vesicle formation and virus entry , cells were treated with 6 . 3 m M of latB for , 10 min . at 37 u C prior to the addition of virus particles . Image analysis Image analysis was performed as previously described [ 15 ] with the following modifications . Slidebook 4 . 2 . 13 ( III ) was used to view , scale , and export images for publication . Movies were generated by exporting a series of continuous TIFF files from a Slidebook time - lapse acquisition and compiling the images into a single AVI file using ImageJ ( NIH ) . SigmaPlot 8 . 0 ( SYSTAT ; Point Richmond , CA ) was used to plot data . Microsoft Excel was used to determine whether data from 2 categories differ in a statistically significant manner using two - tailed Student’s t - tests . An automated image analysis application ( IMAB ) [ 8 ] developed within MATLAB ( Mathworks ; Natick , MA ) was used to track the formation of clathrin - coated structures and the internalization of single virus particles . Images were processed for analysis as previously described , and established criteria were used to exclude incomplete endocytic events and events in which pixels assigned to one clathrin structure merged with or split from an adjacent structure [ 8 ] . For each cell of interest , the first , 50 pits lacking virus particles were analyzed in detail to measure the coat lifetime and protein composition ( see below ) . All complete virus uptake events that occurred in these cells were also analyzed in a similar manner . With the exception of internalization events blocked by latB , incomplete internalization events or events truncated by the start / end of image acquisition were not analyzed . Aggregates of virus were identified as objects with fluorescence intensities greater than that of single particles and were excluded from all analyses . IMAB was used to measure the fluorescence intensity of coat components or virus particles in the following manner . A roughly spherical mask encompassing 69 pixels was centered on the peak fluorescence intensity of the object in all frames that the object was detectable above the local background fluorescence . The contri - bution of the local background fluorescence was estimated by measuring the average intensity of pixels within a ring of single pixel width that extended from the outer boundary of the object mask . The intensity of the pixels within the object mask was then summed , and the average intensity value of pixels in the local background was subtracted from each pixel within the object mask to estimate the fluorescence contributed by proteins ( or dye molecules ) within the object of interest . Electron microscopy Purified virus particles were deposited onto carbon - coated copper grids and stained with 2 % phosphotungstic acid ( PTA ) in H 2 O ( pH 7 . 5 ) . To visualize DI - T particles in clathrin - coated pits , BSC1 cells were inoculated with unlabeled DI - T particles using a dose that yielded , 1000 attached particles per cell after 10 min . Samples were then processed for ultra - thin sectioning as previously described [ 15 , 59 ] . Electron micrographs of VSV particles in clathrin endocytic structures were obtained from cells infected with VSV for 6 h , where the entry of newly released particles could readily be visualized . Virus particles and ultra - thin sections of cells were viewed using a Tecnai G 2 Spirit BioTWIN transmission electron microscope ( FEI , Hillsboro , OR ) . Figure 7 . Model of DI - T and VSV entry . DI - T ( above ) and VSV ( below ) particles engage host cells through interactions between the viral surface glycoproteins and unknown cellular receptor moieties . Following attachment , both particle types undergo slow diffusion ( diffusion coefficient , 5 6 10 2 11 cm 2 s 2 1 ) on the cell surface for an average of , 2 min . before being captured by a clathrin - coated pit . For DI - T , continued clathrin assembly drives complete particle envelopment by the plasma membrane and leads to virus endocytosis . In contrast , the presence of a VSV particle in a coated pit physically prevents complete membrane constriction by the clathrin machinery and causes clathrin assembly to halt prematurely . The force provided by actin polymerization then further remodels the plasma membrane and thereby encloses the virus particle in a partially clathrin - coated vesicle . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1001127 . g007 Virus Length Alters Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 10 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 Supporting Information Video S1 Clathrin - dependent DI - T internalization . BSC1 cells stably expressing s 2 - eGFP ( green ) were inoculated with DI - T particles , and time - lapse images were acquired at 4 s intervals . A 4 . 2 6 4 . 2 m m 2 area of the cell surface is shown as in Figure 2B . The video depicts a single DI - T particle ( red ) that attaches to the plasma membrane and diffuses slowly . A clathrin - coated pit captures the virus particle when a dim adaptor spot colocalizes with the virus signal . The adaptor fluorescence intensity increases as coated pit assembly proceeds , and particle internalization occurs shortly after the adaptor signal peaks . Disappearance of the adaptor signal signifies clathrin uncoating , and the virus - containing vesicle is then transported toward the cell interior .
