Here , we develop techniques for genetic manipulation in the filasterean 20 Capsaspora owczarzaki and use these tools to characterize the Capsaspora ortholog of 21 the Hippo signaling nuclear effector YAP / TAZ / Yorkie ( coYki ) . In contrast to its potent 22 oncogene activity in metazoans , we show that coYki is dispensable for cell proliferation 23 but regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and the morphology of multicellular aggregates in 24 Capsaspora . Our results suggest an ancestral role for the Hippo pathway in cytoskeletal 25 regulation , which was later co - opted to regulate cell proliferation in animals . 26 27 One Sentence Summary : Gene disruption in a unicellular holozoan suggests an 28 ancestral role for YAP / TAZ / Yorkie in cytoskeletal regulation and cell aggregation but not 29 cell proliferation . 30 31 32 Main text : 33 The vast morphological diversity observed in animals is generated by developmental 34 programs mediated by a surprisingly small set of conserved signaling pathways ( 1 ) . An 35 exciting and unexpected finding from comparative genomic analysis indicates that many 36 components of these pathways are present in the closest unicellular relatives of animals 37 ( 2 ) . This finding raises the question of whether these genes show similar functions in 38 animals and their unicellular relatives , and , if not , what the ancestral functions of these 39 3 genes were , and how they evolved to function in multicellular processes in animals . 40 Answering this question could illuminate the roots of animal multicellularity and provide 41 novel perspective on how to manipulate the activity of these biomedically important 42 pathways . 43 44 One such signaling pathway is the Hippo pathway , which coordinates cell proliferation , 45 differentiation , and survival in animals . Initially defined as a tumor suppressor pathway 46 that restricts tissue growth in Drosophila development , Hippo signaling plays a conserved 47 role in organ size control and regeneration in mammals ( 3 , 4 ) . This pathway comprises a 48 core kinase cascade involving sequential activation of two kinases , Hpo / MST and 49 Wts / LATS , which culminates in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the potent growth - 50 stimulatory transcriptional coactivator Yorkie / YAP / TAZ ( 5 ) . This core kinase cascade is 51 in turn regulated by diverse upstream inputs , most notably mechanical force , the state of 52 the actin cytoskeleton , and cell - cell or cell - substrate adhesion as part of a 53 mechanotransduction pathway that relays mechanical and architectural cues to gene 54 expression ( 6 ) . Echoing its pervasive function in metazoan growth control , the Hippo 55 pathway is required for contact - inhibition of proliferation in cultured mammalian cells ( 7 ) , 56 and defective Hippo signaling leading to YAP / TAZ oncogene activation is a major driver 57 of human cancers ( 8 ) . 58 59 The Hippo pathway was at one point thought to be specific to animals . However , recent 60 genome sequencing efforts have revealed that a core Hippo pathway and many known 61 upstream regulators are encoded in the genomes of the closest unicellular relatives of 62 4 animals such as choanoflagellates and filasterians ( 9 ) . The choanoflagellates are 63 flagellated filter feeders that can form multicellular rosette structures by incomplete 64 cytokinesis ( 10 ) , whereas filasterians are amoeboid organisms characterized by actin - 65 rich filopodial projections ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) and represent the most basal known unicellular 66 organism encoding all core components of the Hippo pathway ( 9 ) . Capsaspora 67 owczarzaki is a filasterean originally isolated as a putative endosymbiont in the freshwater 68 snail B . glabrata that can attack and kill the parasitic schistosome S . mansoni ( 11 ) . 69 Capsaspora can be cultured easily in growth medium containing protein source and 70 serum in adherent or shaking culture and can be transiently transfected , allowing for the 71 examination of protein localization using fluorescent fusion proteins ( 12 ) . Although 72 Capsaspora tends to grow as a unicellular organism in laboratory culture conditions , 73 under certain conditions Capsaspora cells can adhere to each other to form multicellular 74 aggregates ( Fig . 1 , C to E , ( 13 ) ) , suggesting that multicellular behaviors may have been 75 selected for in the lineage leading to Capsaspora . Previously , we have shown that 76 overexpression of Capsaspora Hippo pathway components such as CoYki and CoHpo in 77 Drosophila elicits similar phenotypes as their Drosophila counterpart ( 9 ) , suggesting that 78 a biochemically active Hippo signaling pathway likely evolved well before the emergence 79 of Metazoa . Besides the Hippo pathway , the Capsaspora genome encodes homologues 80 of other key regulators of animal development such as components of the integrin 81 adhesome ( 14 ) , cadherins ( 15 ) , tyrosine kinases such as Src and Abl ( 16 ) , NF - kB ( 17 ) 82 and p53 ( 18 ) . Thus , Capsaspora offers a unique opportunity to elucidate the ancestral 83 function of these important developmental regulators in a close unicellular relative of 84 animals . 85 5 86 In an effort to make Capsaspora a tractable system for evolutionary cell biology studies , 87 we developed genetic tools for overexpression and loss - of - function analysis . We first 88 established a method for engineering stable Capsaspora cell lines by transfecting a vector 89 encoding the fluorescent protein mScarlet and resistance to the antibiotic Geneticin 90 ( GenR ) . After transfection , antibiotic selection , and generation of clonal lines by serial 91 dilution , we were able to generate uniformly mScarlet - positive clonal populations of cells 92 ( Fig . 1F ) . Besides GenR , transfection of Capsaspora with genes encoding resistance to 93 nourseothricin ( NatR ) or hygromycin ( HygR ) followed by selection with the respective 94 antibiotic could also generate drug - resistant transformants ( fig . S1 ) . These results 95 demonstrate that stable Capsaspora cell lines expressing multiple transgenes can be 96 generated . 97 98 We next sought to develop tools for loss - of - function analysis in Capsaspora . After 99 unsuccessful attempts with CRISPR - Cas9 - mediated genome editing , possibly due to the 100 lack of nonhomologous end joining machinery components in Capsaspora , we used 101 homologous recombination for gene disruption by replacing each allele of a diploid 102 Capsaspora gene with a distinct selectable antibiotic marker ( Fig . 1G ) . This strategy 103 allowed us to generate a cell line in which both coYki alleles were disrupted ( fig . S2 ) , with 104 no detectable expression of the deleted region of coYki ( Fig . 1 , H to J ) . These results 105 demonstrate the generation of a homozygous coYki disruption mutant ( subsequently 106 coYki - / - ) and establish a method for the generation of mutants by gene targeting in 107 Capsaspora . 108 6 109 To determine the effect of loss - of - coYki on cell proliferation , we examined the proliferation 110 of Capsaspora cells in adherent or shaking culture . In contrast to what may be expected 111 based on previous studies in animal cells , we observed no significant difference in cell 112 proliferation between WT and coYki - / - cells in either condition ( Fig . S3 ) . We next sought 113 to examine cell proliferation within Capsaspora aggregates . Previously , aggregates have 114 been generated by gentle shaking of cell cultures ( 13 ) . To make aggregates more 115 amenable to extended imaging in situ , we developed a condition that induced robust 116 aggregate formation by plating Capsaspora cells in low - adherence wells ( Fig . 1 , C to E ) . 117 Under this condition , most cells coalesced into aggregates over 2 - 3 days , leaving few 118 isolated cells in the culture . Treatment with the calcium chelator EGTA resulted in rapid 119 dissociation of the aggregates ( fig . S4 ) , suggesting that calcium - dependent cell adhesion 120 mediates aggregate integrity . We used EdU incorporation to label proliferating cells in 121 aggregates , and observed no significant difference in the percent of EdU - positive cells 122 between WT and coYki - / - genotypes ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . U nlike clones of cultured 123 mammalian cells that often display increased cell proliferation at the clonal boundary ( 19 ) , 124 distribution of EdU + cells was homogeneous within Capsaspora aggregates ( Fig . 2A ) , 125 suggesting that a mechanism akin to contact - mediated inhibition of proliferation is absent 126 in Capsaspora . Together , these results suggest that the rate of proliferation of 127 Capsaspora is independent of YAP / TAZ / Yorkie or contact inhibition . 128 129 While examining Capsaspora aggregates , we observed a profound phenotype in the 130 shape of the coYki - / - aggregates . After aggregate induction by plating cells in low - 131 7 adherence conditions , WT cell aggregates showed a round morphology ( Fig . 2C ) . In 132 contrast , coYki - / - aggregates were asymmetric and less circular than WT aggregates 133 ( Fig . 2D ) . Computational analysis of aggregate morphology and size revealed that WT 134 and coYki - / - aggregate size was not significantly different ( Fig . 2E ) , whereas coYki - / - 135 aggregates were significantly less circular than WT aggregates ( Fig . 2F ) . Optical 136 sectioning of aggregates expressing mScarlet showed that WT aggregates were thicker 137 perpendicular to the culture surface and more spherical than coYki - / - aggregates ( Fig . 138 2G ) . Time - lapse microscopy of aggregation over a period of six days showed that , 139 whereas WT cells accreted into round aggregates that fused with other aggregates when 140 in close proximity but never underwent fission , coYki - / - aggregates were dynamically 141 asymmetrical , showed a progressive reduction in circularity , and occasionally underwent 142 fission ( movie S1 ) . Taken together , these findings uncover a critical role for coYki in social 143 interactions underlying aggregate morphology , but not cell proliferation , in Capsaspora . 144 145 Cell - cell adhesion and cell - substrate adhesion affect the morphology and stability of 146 tumor cell aggregates ( 20 , 21 ) . We therefore tested whether cell - cell adhesion and cell - 147 substrate adhesion differ in WT and coYki - / - cells . A prediction of differential cell - cell 148 adhesion is that mosaic aggregates of WT and coYki - / - cells may show cell sorting within 149 aggregates ( 22 ) . To test this prediction , we induced aggregate formation after mixing 150 mCherry - labeled WT or coYki - / - cells with unlabeled WT cells at 1 : 9 ratio . The distribution 151 of mCherry - labeled WT or coYki - / - cells within such mixed aggregates was similar and 152 no cell sorting was evident ( fig . S5 ) , indicating that individual coYki - / - cells are competent 153 to adhere to and integrate within aggregates and suggesting that the aberrant morphology 154 8 of coYki - / - aggregates is an emergent property of a large number of coYki - / - cells . To 155 further test whether cell - cell adhesion differs in WT and coYki - / - cells , we vigorously 156 vortexed Capsaspora culture to separate individual cells , allowed cell clumps to form by 157 cell - cell adhesion under gentle rotation , and then counted the number of cells in each 158 clump . Numbers of cells per clump were similar for WT and coYki - / - cells ( fig . S6A ) , 159 suggesting that the occurrence of cell - cell adhesion is similar in these genotypes . We 160 next tested whether cell - substrate adhesion differed in WT and coYki - / - cells by agitating 161 cultures of adherent cells and counting the number of cells that disassociate from the 162 culture surface . After agitation , significantly more coYki - / - cells remained attached to the 163 culture surface compared to WT cells ( fig . S6B ) , indicating that coYki negatively regulates 164 cell - substrate adhesion . Together , our data suggest that coYki affects the morphology of 165 cell aggregates by affecting cell - substrate adhesion but not cell - cell adhesion . 166 167 To characterize properties of coYki - / - cells that may contribute to abnormal aggregate 168 morphology , we used time - lapse microscopy to examine the dynamic morphology of 169 individual WT and coYki - / - cells in adherent culture . Interestingly , the cortices of coYki - 170 / - cells were much more dynamic than those of WT cells . Whereas coYki - / - cells display 171 extensive membrane protrusions and retractions , such dynamic membrane structures 172 were rarely observed in WT cells ( movie S2 ) . To characterize the differences in cell 173 membrane dynamics , we quantified the occurrence of cell protrusions in WT cells , coYki 174 - / - cells , and coYki - / - cells expressing a coYki rescue transgene . WT cells rarely showed 175 protrusions . In contrast , coYki - / - cells showed an average of 3 . 1 protrusions per minute 176 ( Fig . 3A ) , a phenotype that was rescued in coYki - / - cells expressing a coYki transgene 177 9 ( Fig . 3A , movie S3 ) . These results suggest that coYki affects the cortical dynamics of 178 Capsaspora cells . 179 180 In principle , the extensive membrane protrusions made by coYki - / - cells may represent 181 F - actin - rich pseudopodia , which drive amoeboid motility , or , alternatively , F - actin - poor 182 blebs , which are actin - depleted extensions of plasma membrane generated by 183 disassociation of the membrane from the cell cortex or cortical rupture ( 23 ) . To distinguish 184 between these possibilities , we stably expressed a fusion protein of the F - actin - binding 185 Lifeact peptide ( 24 ) with mScarlet in WT and coYki - / - cells and examined F - actin 186 dynamics by time - lapse microscopy in adherent cells . At the basal side of WT cells , 187 Lifeact - mScarlet was often enriched at the cell edge corresponding to the direction of cell 188 movement , suggesting that Capsaspora undergoes F - actin - mediated amoeboid 189 locomotion ( movie S4 ) . As cells move , some Lifeact - mScarlet signal appears as 190 stationary foci on the basal surface , suggesting the existence of actin - rich structures that 191 mediate cell - substrate interaction in Capsaspora ( Fig . 3B , movie S4 ) . Optical sections at 192 mid - height of WT cells showed that F - actin was enriched at a circular cell cortex , where 193 transient bursts of small F - actin puncta were often observed ( Fig . 3B , movie S5 ) . In 194 contrast , cortical shape was less circular in coYki - / - cells , and F - actin concentration along 195 the cortex was less uniform ( Fig . 3B ) . During the formation of the membrane protrusions 196 produced by coYki - / - cells , F - actin was initially depleted as compared to the rest of the 197 cell ( Fig . 3C , movie S6 ) . After the membrane protrusions had fully extended , F - actin 198 accumulated first at the distal end and then along the entire cortex of the protrusion , 199 followed by the regression of the protrusion . A similar sequence of cytoskeletal events 200 10 occurs in blebbing mammalian cells ( 25 ) . These results suggest that the protrusions 201 observed in coYki - / - cells are actin - depleted blebs , and that after bleb formation , F - actin 202 re - accumulates within the bleb leading to cortical reformation and bleb regression . 203 204 To determine whether the abnormal cortical cytoskeleton is specific to coYki - / - cells in 205 adherent culture , we examined coYki - / - cells within aggregates by time - lapse 206 microscopy . Lifeact - mScarlet - expressing cells were mixed with cells stably expressing 207 the green fluorescent protein Venus so that Lifeact - mScarlet - expressing cells were well - 208 spaced and able to be imaged individually . As in adherent cells , coYki - / - cells within 209 aggregates showed dynamic formation of actin - depleted blebs ( movie S7 ) . Thus , coYki - 210 / - cells show aberrant cortical cytoskeleton and excessive membrane blebbing in both 211 isolated adherent cells and within aggregates . 212 213 Loss of coYki causes both bleb - like protrusions and abnormal aggregate morphology , 214 suggesting that the cellular phenotypes observed in coYki - / - cells ( membrane blebbing 215 and related cortical cytoskeletal defects ) may underlie the aberrant aggregate 216 morphology . We tested this hypothesis by treating coYki - / - cells with Blebbistatin , a 217 myosin II inhibitor named after its bleb - inhibiting activity in mammalian cells ( 26 ) . 218 Strikingly , not only did low concentrations of Blebbistatin suppress the formation of blebs 219 in coYki - / - cells ( Fig . 3D , movie S8 ) , Blebbistatin also rescued the abnormal morphology 220 of coYki - / - aggregates ( Fig . 3E ) . Whereas coYki - / - cell aggregates were asymmetric and 221 showed low circularity ( Fig . 3E’’’ ) , coYki - / - aggregates treated with blebbistatin were 222 circular and resembled WT aggregates ( Fig . 3E’’’’ and 3F ) . These results suggest a 223 11 causal link between the membrane / cytoskeletal defects observed in individual coYki - / - 224 cells and the abnormal morphology of coYki - / - aggregates . 225 226 To characterize the transcriptional targets of coYki that may underlie the 227 morphological / cytoskeletal defects of coYki - / - cells , we performed RNAseq on WT and 228 coYki - / - cells in adherent culture . This analysis revealed 1205 differentially expressed 229 genes , including 397 downregulated and 808 upregulated genes in the coYki mutant . 230 Functional enrichment analysis of these two gene sets revealed distinct enrichment of 231 functional categories ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Genes predicted to encode actin - binding proteins 232 were enriched in the set of genes upregulated in the coYki - / - mutant , suggesting that 233 these genes may play a role in the aberrant cytoskeletal dynamics observed in coYki - / - 234 cells . To further inquire into the potential function of coYki - regulated genes , we searched 235 the 1205 differentially expressed genes against a previously reported Capsaspora 236 phylome ( 27 ) to identify 638 Capsaspora genes with predicted human or mouse 237 orthologs . Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of this mammalian ortholog set showed that the 238 two most significantly enriched functional categories corresponded to cell movement and 239 cell migration ( Fig . 4C ) . Notably , regulation of cell migration was reported as the most 240 enriched functional category among YAP target genes in glioblastoma cells ( 28 ) , and cell 241 motility was an enriched category in an integrative analysis of gene regulatory networks 242 downstream of YAP / TAZ utilizing transcriptomic and cistromic data from multiple human 243 tissues ( 29 ) . However , in contrast to functional enrichment studies in metazoan systems 244 examining genes regulated by Yorkie / YAP / TAZ ( 28 , 30 , 31 ) , no enrichment was detected 245 12 in functional categories of cell proliferation or the cell cycle ( Fig . 4C ) . This finding is 246 consistent with the lack of a proliferative phenotype in coYki - / - cells . 247 248 In summary , we show that coYki regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and potentially other 249 cortical actin - related processes but is dispensable for the proliferation of Capsaspora 250 cells . Such coYki - dependent cortical cytoskeletal function , in turn , regulates the 251 morphology of Capsaspora aggregates in a manner that may involve tuning the strength 252 of cell - substrate adhesion . Although the natural history of Capsaspora , including the 253 selective advantage of cell aggregation , is poorly understood , our findings suggest that 254 cytoskeletal regulation represents an ancestral function of the Hippo pathway predating 255 the origin of Metazoa , and this pathway was later co - opted to control cell proliferation 256 after the unicellular - to - multicellular transition . Given that the cortical cytoskeleton is both 257 an important upstream regulator and a downstream effector of Hippo signaling in animal 258 cells ( 32 , 33 ) , the co - option of the Hippo pathway for cell proliferation control in early 259 metazoans may have provided a convenient mechanism that couples cell proliferation 260 with cytoskeletal and mechanical properties of the cells . Besides illuminating an ancestral 261 function of the Hippo pathway , the genetic tools we have developed for modifying the 262 Capsaspora genome provide an unprecedented opportunity to interrogate the 263 premetazoan functions of other developmental regulators that are present in the genomes 264 of close unicellular relatives of animals . 265 266 References and Notes : 267 1 .

( A ) Capsaspora 459 cells on a glass surface were imaged by time - lapse microscopy and individual cells were 460 scored for number of protrusions per minute . A protrusion is defined as a localized 461 extension of the cell boundary that disrupts a previously inert region of the cortex and / or 462 changes the direction of movement of the cell .

Plasmids constructed for this study 526 527 528 29 Materials and Methods 529 Cell culture 530 Capsaspora cells were maintained in ATCC Medium 1034 ( modified PYNFH medium ) 531 supplemented with 25 μg / mL Ampicillin ( referred to below as “growth medium” ) in a 23°C 532 incubator . Cells were kept in either 25 cm 2 cell culture flasks in 8 mL medium or in 75 cm 2 533 cell culture flasks in 15 ml medium . To induce cell aggregation , cells were resuspended 534 to 7 . 5 x 10 5 cells / ml in growth medium , and 1 ml of this cell suspension was added per 535 well to a 24 - well ultra - low attachment plate ( Sigma CLS3473 ) . To test the effect of 536 blebbistatin on aggregate morphology , a 20 mM stock solution of blebbistatin ( Sigma 537 B0560 ) in DMSO was made , and cells were resuspended to 7 . 5 x 10 5 cells / ml in growth 538 medium with 1 μm blebbistatin or DMSO only as a vehicle control . Aggregates were then 539 generated as described above and imaged with a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope 540 with NIS - Elements acquisition software . 541 542 To characterize cell proliferation during growth on a solid substrate , Capsaspora cells 543 were diluted to 1 x 10 5 cells / ml in growth medium , and 800 μl of this dilution was pipetted 544 into multiple wells in a 24 - well polystyrene cell culture plate . To prevent edge effects , 545 wells at the edge of the plate were not used and were instead filled with 800 μl of water . 546 The plates were then kept in in a 23°C incubator . Each day , 1 . 5 μl of a 500 mM EDTA 547 solution was added to a well , and cells in the well were resuspended by pipetting up and 548 down for one minute . Resuspended cells were then transferred to a 1 . 5 mL tube , 549 vortexed , and then the cell density was determined by hemocytometer . To characterize 550 cell proliferation in shaking culture , cells were diluted to 1 x 10 5 cells / ml in growth medium , 551 30 and 20 ml of this dilution was added to a 125 ml Erlenmeyer culture flask . Cultures were 552 then incubated in an orbital shaker at 150 rpm and 23°C . Cell density was determined 553 daily by transferring 200 μl of culture to a 1 . 5 ml tube , adding 1 . 5 μl of 500 mM EDTA 554 solution to disassociate any aggregated cells , vortexing , and counting by hemocytometer . 555 556 Fixation and staining of aggregates 557 To fix and stain aggregates , aggregates were generated as described above , and then 558 aggregates were collected from a 24 - well plate by gentle pipetting . 500 μl of aggregate 559 suspension was added dropwise to 9 ml of PM PFA ( 100 mM PIPES ph 6 . 9 , 0 . 1 mM 560 MgSO 4 , 4 % PFA filtered through a 0 . 45 μm syringe filter ) in a 15 mL polystyrene tube , 561 and tubes were left undisturbed for 1 hour to allow fixation . Aggregates were then 562 centrifuged at 1000 x g for 3 minutes and resuspended in 500 μl of PEM buffer ( 100 mM 563 PIPES pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM MgSO 4 ) . After transferring aggregates to a 564 microcentrifuge tube , aggregates were centrifuged for 2000 x g for 2 minutes , the 565 supernatant was removed , and aggregates were resuspended in 300 μl of PEM . 566 567 As we found that aggregates were fragile during continued centrifugation - resuspension 568 cycles , we developed a protocol where solution changes could be done without 569 centrifugation using 24 - well plate inserts with an 8 micron pore membrane at the insert 570 base ( Corning 3422 ) . Before use with aggregates , 100 μl PEM buffer was added to a well 571 in a 24 - well plate , 300 μl of PEM was added to a membrane insert , and the insert was 572 placed in the well and allowed to drain ( contact between the membrane and the solution 573 within the well is critical for draining ) . Aggregates in 300 μl of PEM were added to the 574 31 insert , and the insert was moved to a new well with 100 μl of PEM and allowed to drain . 575 As a wash step , the membrane insert was then moved to a well containing 1200 μl of 576 PEM , allowing the membrane insert to fill with PEM buffer , and after a 5 minute incubation , 577 the membrane was moved to a new well with 100 μl of PEM and allowed to drain . The 578 membrane insert was then moved to a well containing 1200 μl of PEM 579 block / permeabilization solution ( 100 mM PIPES pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM MgSO 4 , 580 1 % BSA , 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature . The 581 membrane insert was moved to a well with 100 μl of PEM and allowed to drain and then 582 moved into a well containing 1 mL PEM with DAPI ( 2 μg / mL ) and Phalloidin ( 0 . 1 μM ) and 583 incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature . Aggregates were then washed once more 584 in 1200 μl PEM . To mount aggregates for imaging , the membrane insert was placed in a 585 new well with 100 μl of PEM buffer and was allowed to drain , aggregates were 586 resuspended in the residual buffer ( approximately 50 μl ) by gentle pipetting , and then 587 aggregates were pipetted onto a microscope slide and allowed to settle for 5 minutes . 588 Kimwipes were then placed in contact with the edge of the liquid on the slide , allowing for 589 removal of excess buffer by capillary action . 15 μl of Fluoromount G ( SouthernBiotech ) 590 was pipetted onto the aggregates , which were then covered with a 22 x 40 mm cover 591 glass and sealed with nail polish . Aggregates were subsequently imaged with a Zeiss 592 LSM 880 confocal microscope . Staining of adherent cells with phalloidin was done as 593 previously described ( 34 ) . 594 595 EdU labeling of aggregates 596 32 To examine cell proliferation within aggregates by EdU labeling , aggregates were 597 generated in ultra - low adherence 24 - well plates as described above . 3 days after 598 aggregation was initiated , 100 μl of growth medium containing EdU was added to 599 aggregates to result in a 150 μM EdU concentration . Aggregates were incubated with 600 EdU for 4 hours and then fixed and resuspended in 300 μl PEM buffer as described 601 above . Aggregates were then processed for imaging following the manufacturer’s 602 protocol ( ThermoFisher C10339 ) using the 24 - well plate membrane insert method 603 described above to transfer aggregates between solutions . For all steps , wells with 1 mL 604 of solution were used for washing or staining cells in membrane inserts , and wells with 605 100 μl of solution were used to drain wells in preparation for transfer into the next solution . 606 607 Molecular Biology 608 For the sequences of synthesized DNA fragments and oligonucleotides used in this study , 609 see Data S1 and S2 , respectively . For a list of plasmids generated for this study , see Data 610 S3 . To generate a vector for mScarlet expression in Capsaspora ( pJP71 ) , a DNA 611 construct containing an open reading frame encoding the mScarlet protein ( 35 ) codon - 612 optimized for expression in Capsaspora and under control of the previously described 613 EF1 - α promoter and terminator from the pONSY - mCherry vector ( 12 ) was constructed by 614 gene synthesis ( sJP1 ) and cloned into the EcoRV site of the pUC57 - mini vector 615 ( Genscript ) . A KpnI site and an AflII site were incorporated at the beginning and end of 616 the coding sequence , respectively , allowing for the construction of N or C - terminal protein 617 fusion constructs by Gibson assembly . To generate a plasmid for expression of mScarlet 618 and a Geneticin resistance gene ( pJP72 ) , the NeoR coding sequence from the 619 33 Dictyostelium pDM323 vector ( 36 ) was codon optimized for Capsaspora , the optimized 620 sequence was synthesized with the promoter and terminator from the Capsaspora actin 621 ortholog gene CAOG _ 06018 , and the synthesized fragment ( sJP2 ) was cloned into the 622 SmaI site of pJP71 by Gibson assembly . To generate plasmids expressing mScarlet and 623 either nourseothricin resistance ( pJP102 ) or hygromycin resistance ( pJP103 ) , an identical 624 strategy to that used in constructing pJP72 was used , except either a synthesized codon - 625 optimized nourseothricin acetyltransferase gene ( sJP3 ) based on the sequence of 626 pUC18T - mini - Tn7T - nat ( 37 ) or a synthesized codon - optimized hygromycin B 627 phosphotransferase gene ( sJP4 ) based on the sequence of Dictyostelium vector pDM358 628 ( 36 ) was used . 629 630 To generate a plasmid encoding coYki and Hygromycin resistance for rescue of coYki - / - 631 phenotypes ( pJP119 ) , a DNA fragment encoding coYki and a c - terminal OLLAS epitope 632 tag ( 38 ) was generated by PCR from a synthesized a gene encoding the coYki protein 633 ( sJP5 ) using primers oJP101 and oJP102 . To limit recombination of the transgene with 634 the endogenous coYki loci , we recoded the coYki reading frame using synonymous codon 635 replacement , resulting in a coYki gene with 73 percent nucleotide similarity to the WT 636 coYki gene but encoding an identical polypeptide . This PCR product was then cloned into 637 a KpnI and AflII digest of pJP103 using Gibson assembly . 638 639 To generate a plasmid encoding a Lifeact - mScarlet fusion protein and hygromycin 640 resistance ( pJP118 ) , a DNA fragment optimized for expression in Capsaspora encoding 641 the Lifeact peptide ( 24 ) ( sJP6 ) was synthesized and cloned into the KpnI site of pJP103 642 34 by Gibson assembly . To generate a plasmid expressing Venus and Geneticin resistance 643 ( pJP114 ) , the Venus reading frame was amplified from p EF1α - CoH2B : Venus ( Addgene 644 # 111877 , ( 12 ) ) using primers oJP103 and oJP104 and cloned into a KpnI and AflII digest 645 of pJP72 by Gibson assembly . 646 647 Capsaspora Transfection 648 24 - well plates were prepared for transfection by inserting one sterile 12mm circular glass 649 coverslip in each well to aid in cell adhesion during transfection . Capsaspora cells at 650 exponential growth phase were collected by pipetting medium over attached cells , 651 resuspended to 7 . 5 x 10 5 cells / ml in growth medium , and then 800 μl of this cell culture 652 was added per well to the prepared 24 - well plate . Cells were incubated at 23°C overnight . 653 The following day growth medium was removed from cells and was replaced by 800 μl of 654 transfection medium ( Scheider’s Drosophila Medium ( ThermoFisher 21720024 ) with 10 % 655 FBS ( Thermofisher 26140079 ) supplemented with 25 μg / mL Ampicillin ) . After a 10 - minute 656 incubation at room temperature , transfection medium was removed from the cells and 657 replaced with 500 of fresh transfection medium . Transfection mixes were then prepared : 658 100 μl of Opti - MEM I Reduced Serum Medium ( ThermoFisher ) was added to a 1 . 5ml 659 tube , and 1 μg of transfecting DNA was added to this medium ( for multiple plasmids , an 660 equivalent amount of each plasmid by mass was used ) . 3 μl of Trans IT - X2 ® transfection 661 reagent ( Mirus Bio ) was then added to the tube , and the solution was immediately mixed 662 by pipetting up and down . Transfection mixes were incubated at room temperature for 5 663 minutes , and then 70 μl of the transfection mix was added dropwise to one well in the 24 - 664 well plate . Cells were incubated at 23°C for 24 hours , and then the medium was removed 665 35 and replaced with 800 μl of growth medium . To image fluorescent transient transfectants , 666 cells were then resuspended by pipetting up and down , and 300 μl of resuspended cells 667 in growth medium were transferred to a well of an 8 - well chambered coverglass slide 668 ( Nunc ) . Cells were then imaged 48 hours after addition of growth medium using a Zeiss 669 LSM 880 confocal microscope . 670 671 Stable expression of transgenes in clonal Capsaspora cell lines 672 Transforming plasmids were linearized by digestion with either ScaI - HF ® or AseI 673 restriction enzymes ( NEB ) , which cut within the ampicillin resistance gene , and then 674 purified from solution and resuspended in nuclease - free water . Capsaspora cells were 675 transfected with the linearized plasmids using the Trans IT - X2 ® transfection reagent as 676 described above . Two days after growth medium was added to cells following 677 transfection , the growth medium was removed and replaced with 800 μl of growth medium 678 supplemented with selective drugs . Due to observations of variability in cell viability 679 between transfections , three drug concentrations were tested in parallel for each 680 transfection : for Geneticin ( ThermoFisher ) , cells were treated at 40 , 60 , or 80 μg / ml ; for 681 Nourseothricin ( GoldBio ) , cells were treated at 50 , 75 , or 100 μg / ml ; for Hygromycin B 682 ( Sigma ) , cells were treated at 150 , 200 , or 250 μg / ml . Cells were grown in selective 683 medium for 2 weeks , and medium was changed every 3 days . Following selection , clonal 684 cell populations were generated by resuspending cells in growth medium by pipetting , 685 diluting cells to 3 cells / mL in growth medium , and adding 100 μl of this dilution to 200 μl 686 of growth medium per in a well in a 48 - well plate ( this procedure generated approximately 687 10 wells with cell growth for each 48 - well plate ) . To image fluorescence in stably 688 36 transfected lines , clonal cell populations were transferred into wells in a 4 - well glass 689 bottom chamber slide ( Nunc ) , incubated at 23°C for 24 hours , and cells were then imaged 690 using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with NIS - Elements acquisition software . 691 692 Disruption of the Capsaspora coYki gene by gene targeting 693 To disrupt coYki , we attempted to delete a 228 bp segment of the coYki open reading 694 frame that encodes the predicted Tead - binding domain ( 9 ) using a PCR - generated gene 695 targeting construct . We designed a pair of primers that amplify the drug resistance 696 markers described above , including the actin ( CAOG _ 06018 ) promoter and terminator , 697 with 90 bp of homology adjacent to the sequence targeted for deletion at the 5’ end of the 698 primers ( oJP105 and oJP106 ) . These primers were used to amplify the Geneticin 699 resistance cassette from pJP72 by PCR , the resulting PCR product was gel purified and 700 resuspended in nuclease - free water , and WT Capsaspora cells were transfected with this 701 DNA as described above . Clonal populations of drug - resistant transformants were 702 generated as described above , each clone was grown to confluency in one well in a 24 - 703 well plate , cells were collected by pipetting up and down , and genomic DNA was prepared 704 following the protocol described below . To genotype potential mutants , we performed 705 diagnostic PCRs on genomic DNA : to test for presence of the WT allele , we used a 706 forward primer with homology to the genome 5’ of the coYki sequence targeted for 707 deletion ( oJP107 ) and a reverse primer with homology within the sequence targeted for 708 deletion ( oJP108 ) . To detect successful deletion , we used oJP107 as a forward primer 709 and a reverse primer with homology to the geneticin resistance gene ( oJP109 ) . 40 710 percent of analyzed clones ( 6 of 15 tested clones ) showed a PCR product indicative of 711 37 disruption of the coYki allele ( fig . S2B ) . However , all clones showed a band indicative of 712 an intact WT coYki gene . We therefore reasoned that , at least for the culture conditions 713 used during transfection , Capsaspora cells may be diploid . 714 715 After the isolation of clonal lines that were heterozygous for coYki disruption with the 716 Geneticin resistance marker as indicated by diagnostic PCR , we attempted to disrupt the 717 remaining coYki allele using nourseothricin resistance as a marker . pJP102 was used as 718 a template for PCR using primers oJP105 and oJP106 to generate a nourseothricin 719 resistance cassette flanked by homology arms targeting coYki for disruption . This 720 construct was used to transfect a Geneticin - resistant heterozygous coYki disruption 721 mutant , and drug selection of transfectants was done as described above using 722 simultaneous selection with 60 μg / ml Geneticin and 75 μg / ml nourseothricin . After 723 generating clonal populations of drug - resistant transformants , diagnostic PCR was done 724 to detect the intact coYki allele as described above or a deletion allele containing the 725 nourseothricin resistance gene using primers oJP107 and oJP110 . Two cell lines that 726 showed absence of the WT coYki allele and presence of both disruption alleles encoding 727 either Geneticin or nourseothricin resistance were used for subsequent phenotypic 728 studies . 729 730 To quantify coYki gene expression in a putative homozygous coYki disruption mutant 731 ( coYki - / - ) by qPCR , 5 x 10 6 WT or coYki - / - cells were collected from culture flasks while 732 in growth medium by pipetting up and down , and RNA was isolated using a RNeasy Mini 733 Plus kit ( Qiagen ) . cDNA was made using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit ( BioRad ) , qPCR 734 38 reactions were made using iQ TM SRBR â Green Supermix ( BioRad ) , and qPCR was 735 performed using a CFX96 Touch Real - time PCR detection system ( BioRad ) with the 736 following primers : oJP111 and oJP112 to detect GAPDH , oJP113 and oJP114 to detect 737 a region of coYki within the sequence targeted for deletion , and oJP115 and oJP116 to 738 detect a region coYki 3’ of the sequence targeted for deletion . 739 740 Preparing Capsaspora genomic DNA 741 Capsaspora genomic DNA was prepared for PCR analysis following a procedure 742 previously developed for Dictyostelium discoideum ( 39 ) . Cells grown in a 24 - well or 48 - 743 well plate in growth medium were collected by pipetting up and down , pipetted into a 1 . 5 744 mL tube , centrifuged at 4000 x g for 5 minutes , and resuspended in 20 μl of nuclease - 745 free water . 20 μl of Lysis buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 10 mM TRIS pH 8 . 3 , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 45 % 746 NP40 , 0 . 45 % Tween 20 , and 800 μg / ml Proteinase K added fresh from a 20 mg / ml stock ) 747 was added to cells , which were then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes . Tubes 748 were then placed at 95°C for 5 minutes . After cooling to room temperature , 1 μl of this 749 sample was then used as a template in a 20 - μl diagnostic PCR . 750 751 Quantification of aggregate size and circularity 752 ImageJ was used to quantify aggregate size and circularity using aggregate images . 753 Images were converted to 8 - bit format , processed twice using the “Smooth” function , and 754 a Threshold was adjusted for each individual image . The Analyze Particles command was 755 then run with a gate for particle size at 400 - infinity micron 2 and the “exclude on edges” 756 option selected . The returned values for aggregate area and circularity were then used 757 39 for further analysis . Values corresponding to more than one adjacent aggregate 758 interpreted by the algorithm as a single particle were discarded . 759 760 Assaying cell - cell adhesion and cell - substrate adhesion 761 To examine cell - cell adhesion , cells were collected from a culture flask by pipetting growth 762 media over the culture surface , diluted to 1 x 10 6 cells / mL in growth medium , and vortexed 763 to disrupt cell clumps . 1 mL volumes of cell culture were then transferred to 1 . 5 mL tubes 764 and incubated on a Labquake TM rotator ( Thermo ) for one hour at room temperature . 765 Cultures were then examined by hemocytometer , and the number of cells in each clump 766 of cells was counted for at least 35 cell clumps for each independent experiment . 767 768 To examine cell - substrate adhesion , cells were diluted to 5 x 10 5 cells / mL in growth 769 medium , and 3 mL volumes of culture were transferred per well to 6 - well tissue culture - 770 treated polystyrene plates ( Sigma CLS3506 ) and incubated at 23°C for 48 hours . For 771 agitation , plates were then placed on an orbital shaker and shaken at 140 RPM for 10 772 minutes , and then the medium from each well ( “disassociated fraction” ) was transferred 773 to a separate tube and 3 mL of new growth medium was added to each well . 3 μL of 500 774 mM EDTA was then added to each well to detach cells from the culture surface , medium 775 was pipetted up and down over the culture surface 20 times , and this resuspension 776 ( “adherent fraction” ) was transferred to a separate tube . Cell densities of the collected 777 fractions were determined by hemocytometer counts , total cell amounts were calculated 778 by adding the cell numbers for disassociated and adherent fractions for each condition , 779 and the percent of adherent cells for each condition was then calculated . As a control to 780 40 examine cell - substrate adhesion in the absence of agitation , the above protocol was 781 followed , except the orbital shaker agitation step was omitted . 782 783 Time - lapse Microscopy 784 To image cells by time - lapse transmitted light or fluorescence microscopy , cells were 785 resuspended to 1 x 10 8 cells / ml in growth medium , and 10 μl of this cell suspension was 786 added as a spot in the center of a well in a 4 - well chambered coverglass slide ( Nunc ) . 787 After a 1 hour incubation at room temperature to allow the cells to settle , the 10 μl volume 788 of medium was removed , and 1 ml of growth medium was added to the well , resulting in 789 a spot of cells in the center of the well . Cells were incubated at room temperature for 24 790 hours , a field of view with well - spaced cells was located , and then cells were imaged by 791 time - lapse microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with NIS - Elements 792 acquisition software . To image the effect of blebbistatin on individual cells , similar imaging 793 of cells was done , except that cells were treated with either DMSO or 1 μm bebbistatin 794 ( Sigma B0560 ) for one hour before imaging . To image aggregates by time - lapse 795 microscopy , aggregates were generated in ultra - low attachment plates as described 796 above . During aggregate formation , 4 - well chambered coverglass slides ( Nunc ) were 797 coated with UltraPure agarose ( ThermoFisher ) by making a 1 % agarose in nuclease - free 798 water mixture , microwaving to dissolve the agarose , adding 800 μl of molten agarose per 799 well , and removing the molten agarose after 10 seconds by aspiration . Coated wells were 800 then allowed to dry at room temperature in a cell culture hood , resulting in a thin coating 801 of agarose . This coating functions to prevent aggregate adhesion to the glass surface . 802 After aggregate formation , aggregates were resuspended in the well by gentle pipetting , 803 41 and then an 800 μl volume of resuspended aggregates was transferred into one agarose - 804 coated well in a 4 - well chambered coverglass slide . Aggregates were then imaged using 805 a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope . 806 807 RNA - seq 808 To perform RNA - seq on Capsaspora cells , WT or coYki - / - cells were collected from 809 growth flasks by removing growth medium , adding fresh growth medium , and 810 resuspending cells attached to the flask by pipetting the medium over the surface . Cells 811 were then diluted to 2 x 10 5 cells / mL , and for each genotype two 75 cm 2 culture flasks 812 were prepared by adding 16 mL of culture dilution to each flask . Culture flasks were 813 incubated at 23°C for 2 days , and then cells were collected by pipetting growth medium 814 over attached cells . Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2100 x g for 5 minutes , and 815 then all cells for each genotype were combined , resuspended in 500 μl of growth medium , 816 and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube . RNA was then prepared with the RNEasy Plus 817 Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) using the QIAshredder spin column ( Qiagen ) to homogenize the lysate . 818 RNA samples were run on an Agilent Tapestation 4200 to determine level of degradation , 819 thus ensuring only high quality RNA was used ( RIN Score 8 or higher ) . A Qubit® 4 . 0 820 Fluorimeter ( ThermoFisher ) was used to determine the concentration prior to staring 821 library prep . One microgram of total DNAse - treated RNA was then prepared with the 822 TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit ( Illumina ) . Poly - A RNA was purified and 823 fragmented before strand specific cDNA synthesis . cDNA was then A - tailed and indexed 824 adapters were ligated . After adapter ligation , samples were PCR - amplified and purified 825 with AmpureXP beads , then validated again on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 . Before 826 42 being normalized and pooled , samples were quantified by Qubit then run on an Illumina 827 NextSeq 500 using V2 . 5 reagents . Three biological replicates were sequenced for each 828 genotype , with 22 - 31 million reads generated per sample . The fastq files were checked 829 for quality using fastqc ( v0 . 11 . 2 ) ( 40 ) and fastq _ screen ( v0 . 4 . 4 ) ( 41 ) . Fastq files were 830 mapped to GCF _ 000151315 . 2 reference assembly using STAR ( 42 ) . Read counts were 831 then generated using featureCounts ( 43 ) . Trimmed Mean of M - values normalization and 832 differential expression analysis were performed using edgeR ( 44 ) ( false discovery rate 833 ( FDR ) < = 0 . 05 , absolute log2 ( fold change ) > = 0 . 5 , log ( counts per million ) > = 0 ) . 834 Phylogenetic trees were downloaded from PhyloDB ( 45 ) corresponding to Capsaspora 835 ( PhyID 101 ) and pairwise distances for each gene were extracted using an R package 836 ape ( 46 ) . Closest Human and mouse orthologues were then extracted and used to 837 annotate the Capsaspora genes . These annotated gene names were then used with IPA 838 ( 47 ) ( QIAGEN Inc . , https : / / www . qiagenbioinformatics . com / products / ingenuity - pathway - 839 analysis ) to get significantly enriched pathways in “Diseases and Bio Functions” category . 840 To identify functional enrichment in the sets of genes upregulated or downregulated in 841 coYki - / - cells , DAVID Functional Annotation Tool ( 48 ) was used to identify functional 842 categories with FDR < 0 . 05 using all Capsaspora genome genes as the gene population 843 background . 844 845 Statistics 846 All statistics were done using Prism ( GraphPad software , San Diego , CA ) . Student’s t - 847 test was done to compare differences between two groups , and one - way analysis of 848 43 variance ( ANOVA ) with a post - hoc test was used to compare differences among groups 849 greater than two . 850 851 Gene nomenclature 852 In the manuscript we use italicized text to refer to a gene ( e . g . , coYki ) , unitalicized text 853 to refer to a protein ( e . g . , coYki ) , “ - / - “ to indicate a homozygous deletion mutant ( e . g . , 854 coYki - / - ) , and “ > ” to indicate a promoter driving the expression of a gene ( e . g . , EF1 > 855 coYki ) . 856 44 857 Fig .

Cells were 859 transfected with plasmids encoding mScarlet with no antibiotic marker ( pJP71 ) , GenR 860 ( pJP72 ) , NatR ( pJP102 ) , or HygR ( pJP103 ) genes and were treated with the indicated 861 antibiotics 2 days after transfection for the indicated time period . Representative images 862 45 of the population are shown . Round , phase - bright cells are visible in populations 863 transfected with resistance markers but not cells transfected with mScarlet . 864 865 866 867 46 868 869 Fig . S2 . Diagnostic PCR of putative coYki deletion clonal cell lines . ( A ) Diagram of 870 primer pairs used to evaluate the presence of the WT coYki allele ( coYki WT ) , a deletion 871 of a region of coYki using the GenR marker ( D coYki : : GenR ) , or a deletion of a region of 872 coYki using the NatR marker ( D coYki : : NatR ) . TBD , Tead - binding domain ; WW , WW 873 domain ; GenR , Geneticin resistance ; NatR , nourseothricin resistance . ( B ) WT cells were 874 transfected with a gene - targeting construct encoding GenR designed to delete the TBD 875 47 in the coYki gene by homologous recombination ( see figure 1G in main text ) . Following 876 transfection and drug selection , clonal populations of transfectants were generated and 877 analyzed by diagnostic PCR using the indicated primer pairs . “ * ” indicates a clone 878 showing a PCR product indicative of heterozygous coYki disruption . ( C ) A clonal cell line 879 with a diagnostic PCR result indicating the disruption of a coYki allele with GenR was 880 transfected with a gene - targeting construct encoding NatR designed to delete the TBD in 881 the coYki gene . After selection with both Geneticin and nourseothricin , clonal populations 882 of transfectants were generated and analyzed by diagnostic PCR using the indicated 883 primer pairs . “ * ” indicates a clone showing a PCR product indicative of homozygous coYki 884 disruption . 885 886 887 48 888 889 Fig . S3 . WT and coYki - / - cells proliferate at a similar rate . ( A ) To examine proliferation 890 on a solid substrate , cells were grown in wells in a 24 - well plate , and each day cells within 891 one well were resuspended and counted . ( B ) To examine proliferation in shaking culture , 892 cells were grown in flasks on an orbital shaker , and an aliquot of cells was collected and 893 counted daily . Values are mean ± SEM ( n ³ 3 ) . Absence of error bars indicates that error 894 is smaller than the plot symbol . 895 896 897 49 898 899 Fig . S4 . Calcium is required for adhesion in Capsapsora cell aggregates . 900 Capsaspora aggregates were treated with water ( vehicle control ) , the calcium chelator 901 EGTA , or EGTA with an excess of calcium . At 30 minutes aggregates treated with EGTA 902 had begun to disassociate , with further disassociation evident at 24 hours . Simultaneous 903 addition of an excess of calcium blocked this disassociation . 904 905 906 50 907 908 Fig . S5 . coYki - / - cells adhere to and integrate within WT aggregates like WT cells . 909 ( A - D ) Cells expressing mScarlet in the WT background ( A - B ) or in the coYki - / - mutant 910 background ( C - D ) were allowed to aggregate as a homogeneous population ( A , C ) or 911 were mixed with 90 % WT cells and allowed to aggregate ( B , D ) . Individual mScarlet - 912 labeled coYki - / - cells associate with WT cells within aggregates ( D’ ) in an organization 913 like that of cells from the WT background labeled with mScarlet ( B’ ) . Scale bar is 75 914 microns . 915 916 917 51 918 Fig . S6 . coYki affects cell - substrate adhesion but shows no effect on cell - cell 919 adhesion . ( A ) To examine cell - cell adhesion , cells in suspension were gently rotated for 920 an hour to stimulate clump formation through cell - cell adhesion . Cultures were then 921 examined by hemocytometer and the number of cells per clump was counted . Each red 922 circle indicates the number of cells in a single clump , and error bars indicate the mean ± 923 SEM of the average number of cells per clump from 3 independent experiments . Absence 924 52 of error bars indicates that error is smaller than the plot symbol . The difference in average 925 number of cells per clump between WT and coYki - / - is not significant ( t - test ) . ( B ) To 926 examine cell - substrate adhesion , adherent cell cultures were either agitated on a rotary 927 shaker for 10 minutes or left untreated , and then the number of adhered and unadhered 928 cells in each culture was counted and the percent of cells adhered to the culture substrate 929 was calculated . The difference between WT and coYki - / - is significant for the percent of 930 cells attached to substrate after agitation ( p < 0 . 0001 , t - test ) . 931 53 Movie S1 .
