All germ cell lineages originate from primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , which are segregated from the somatic cell lineage at an early developmental stage 1 – 3 . In mice , PGCs arise from the postimplantation epiblast at embry - onic day ( E ) 6 in response to bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) - 4 secreted from the neighboring extraembryonic ectoderm 4 . After specification , PGCs start to migrate while proliferating along the hindgut endoderm toward the genital ridge that in turn forms either the ovary or the testis 1 – 3 . In the genital ridge , PGCs continue to pro - liferate and then enter into meiosis to become oogonia at around E13 . 5 in female mice , whereas in male mice , after substantial pro - liferation , PGCs enter into mitotic arrest to become gonocytes from around E15 . 5 ( refs . 5 , 6 ) . In the perinatal period , the oogonium differentiates into primary oocytes surrounded by simple squa - mous pregranulosa cells ; the cell complex is called the primor - dial follicle 7 . In mice , follicular development begins shortly after birth , whereas most of the primordial follicles are dormant until puberty . The egg , the fully grown oocyte , confers totipotency to the genome of the zygote on fertilization , thereby having the principal role in the creation of new individuals . Nuclear transplantation experiments demonstrate that egg cytoplasm reprograms even the genome of a differentiated somatic cell into the totipotent state 8 , 9 . Thus , female germ cell development includes a fundamental bio - logical process that involves mechanisms underlying totipotency and reprogramming . Reconstitution of the developmental process from PGCs to eggs in culture would be a key advance in our understanding of the mechanism of female germ cell development . By using PSCs , such as ESCs and iPSCs , we recently developed a culture system that faithfully reconstitutes PGC specification and produces a robust number of cells whose characteristics are highly similar if not identi - cal to those of nascent PGCs in vivo , on the basis of the criteria of gene expression and epigenetic status 10 . Notably , the PGCs derived from ESCs and iPSCs , namely PGCLCs , have the potential to give rise to functional sperm upon transplantation into seminiferous tubules 10 . More recently , it was shown that PGCLCs gave rise to eggs when aggregated with somatic cells of female embryonic gonads , followed by transplantation under the ovarian bursas of adult mice 11 . Although differentiation from PGCLCs to oocytes is governed by environmental cues at the transplantation site in vivo , this result raises the possibility that the entire process of germ cell development could be reconstituted using ESCs / iPSCs and related somatic cells . Comparison with other methods There have been several reports attempting to generate PGCs in vitro from ESCs or iPSCs and from epiblast stem cells , a novel type of PSCs derived from the epiblast 12 – 17 . These methods are mostly based on the undirected differentiation of the PSCs as a monolayer culture or embryoid bodies and on the selection of rare germ cell – like cells among randomly differentiated cells . Furthermore , the robustness of PGC differentiation from PSCs is limited . Although some of these studies succeeded in producing haploid sperm - like cells 14 , 15 and oocyte - like cells with undefined ploidy 12 , 17 , these studies failed to generate or did not attempt to generate healthy offspring from the in vitro – derived gamete , which is the strict standard for validating the function of germ cells . One paper reported success in generating offspring with abnormalities in body size and longevity 15 , and these abnormali - ties were presumably due to a defective process during germ cell derivation in vitro . During germ cell development , totipotency has to be properly established through orchestrated gene expres - sion and epigenetic reprogramming . Epigenetic reprogram - ming is in part accomplished in PGCs , in which genome - wide reorganization of histone modification and DNA methylation occur 18 . Therefore , the ideal in vitro system inducing germ cells from ESCs or iPSCs must recapitulate germ cell development in vivo ( see the Experimental design ) .

Published online 11 July 2013 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nprot . 2013 . 090 oogenesis is an integrated process through which an egg acquires the potential for totipotency , a fundamental condition for creating new individuals . reconstitution of oogenesis in a culture that generates eggs with proper function from pluripotent stem cells ( pscs ) is therefore one of the key goals in basic biology as well as in reproductive medicine . Here we describe a stepwise protocol for the generation of eggs from mouse pscs , such as embryonic stem cells ( escs ) and induced pluripotent stem cells ( ipscs ) . escs and ipscs are first induced into primordial germ cell – like cells ( pGclcs ) that are in turn aggregated with somatic cells of female embryonic gonads , the precursors for adult ovaries . Induction of pGclcs followed by aggregation with the somatic cells takes up to 8 d . the aggregations are then transplanted under the ovarian bursa , in which pGclcs grow into germinal vesicle ( GV ) oocytes in ~ 1 month . the pGclc - derived GV oocytes can be matured into eggs in 1 d by in vitro maturation ( IVM ) , and they can be fertilized with spermatozoa by in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) to obtain healthy and fertile offspring . this method provides an initial step toward reconstitution of the entire process of oogenesis in vitro . © 201 3 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . protocol 1514 | VOL . 8 NO . 8 | 2013 | nature protocols There are several technical reports showing that PGCs differ - entiate into eggs and spermatozoa by transplantation into adult tissues . Transplantation of nascent PGCs into testis was shown to yield mature spermatozoa 19 . In another study , transplantation of E12 . 5 male PGCs with gonads into the kidney capsule also yielded spermatids 20 . Notably , in both cases , the mature spermatozoa or spermatids from the PGCs were fully potent , as they give rise to healthy offspring . Likewise , female PGCs with gonads differenti - ate into fully functional eggs by transplantation either under the ovarian bursa or into the kidney capsule 20 , 21 . Although the details of how PGCs undergo gametogenesis in the transplanted tissue are unclear , these reports nevertheless emphasize the significance of producing proper PGCs in vitro . Experimental design The postimplantation epiblast has a unique cell context with the capability of evoking PGC fate in response to BMP4 ( PGC competence ) , in sharp contrast to ESCs , which do not have this capacity and rather promote self - renewal in response to BMP4 ( ref . 22 ) . Therefore , to reconstitute PGC specification in vitro , it is necessary to construct an epiblast - like state with PGC com - petence in ESCs . This protocol starts with the culture of ESCs or iPSCs ( Steps 1 – 9 ) that are then converted from ESCs to epiblast via culture with basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and activin A ( Steps 10 – 17 ) , on the basis of the evidence that these cytokines induce ESC differentiation into epiblast stem cells 16 , 23 , 24 . ESCs at day 2 of culture with bFGF and activin A became flat and simple epithelium – like structures that morphologically resemble an epi - blast , and therefore they have been designated epiblast - like cells ( EpiLCs ) 10 ( Fig . 1 ) . Notably , EpiLCs possess PGC competence , as they differentiate into PGCLCs ( Steps 18 – 29 ) in response to a set of cytokines sufficient for induction of PGC differentiation in the epiblast 25 . Activin A seems to be crucial for the acquisition of PGC competence , as withdrawal of activin A attenuates PGCLC induction ( K . H . , F . Nakaki and M . S . , unpublished observation ) . bFGF and knockout serum replacement ( KSR ) are likely to have roles or positive effects on the viability of EpiLCs ( K . H . and M . S . , unpublished observation ) . Figure 1 shows a representative result of PGCLC induction from EpiLCs harboring Blimp1 - mVenus ( BV ; note that Blimp1 is officially known as Prdm1 ) and Stella - ECFP ( SC ; note that Stella is officially known as Dppa3 ) reporter genes that facilitate PGCLC induction in culture 26 . BV - positive PGCLCs are induced in a large population of EpiLCs but not in all EpiLCs . The non - PGC population includes undefined somatic cell lineages and an undifferentiated ESC - like cell lineage . SC is detectable in a subset , but not all , of BV - positive PGCLCs 10 . The efficiency of PGCLC induction is different in each ESC line used . It is unlikely that the efficiency depends on the sex of ESCs , as both the male and female ESCs tested differentiated into EpiLCs followed by PGCLCs at a comparable efficiency 10 , 11 . Although BV and SC reporter genes indeed facilitate the detec - tion of PGCLCs in culture , such reporter - harboring ESCs have to be established in advance , making it impossible to apply the culture system to existing ESCs or iPSCs without an appropriate reporter . To overcome this obstacle , we identified SSEA1 and integrin - β 3 ( CD61 ) as endogenous surface proteins expressed selectively on BV - positive PGCLCs 10 . In accordance with a previous study that succeeded in trans - planting PGCs into ovaries 21 , in our protocol , PGCLCs are aggregated with somatic cells of E12 . 5 female embryonic gonads ( Steps 82 – 86 ) and then transferred under the ovarian bursa ( Steps 87 – 111 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . When you are performing the procedure , note that because Steps 30 – 53 ( dissociation of PGCLCs for purifi - cation and FACS sorting of PGCLCs ) and Steps 54 – 81 ( collection of somatic cells ) are best performed in parallel , more than one investigator is required for this part of the procedure . PGCLCs with the somatic cells grow into GV oocytes ( Fig . 1 ) . In the case of using BVSC - reporter ESCs , SC but not BV is detectable in PGCLC - derived oocytes . GV oocytes are mechanically collected and then can be matured by IVM ( Fig . 1 ) . Oocytes that reach meiotic metaphase II ( MII ) can be fertilized by IVF ( Steps 112 – 121 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Transfer of the resultant two - cell – stage embryos into the oviduct of pseudopregnant recipient female mice gives rise to healthy and fertile offspring ( Steps 122 – 124 ; Fig . 1 ; ref . 11 ) .

A sufficient level of CD61 and SSEA1 expression on the cell surface is observed at day 4 of culture . The number of PGCLCs obtained from an aggregation is between 500 and 3 , 000 , depending on the ESC or iPSC line used . We usually use a BVSC - reporter ESC line , BVSCH18 , which yields an average of about 1 , 000 to 1 , 500 BV - positive PGCLCs from an aggregation at day 3 of culture . Therefore , we usually induce PGCLCs on three Lipidure - Coat plates , which then yield about 3 × 10 5 PGCLCs in total . For practical purposes , we usually use ten pregnant female mice for the collection of somatic cells of female embryonic gonads , as the number of the cells depends on the number of fetuses in a litter and the sex ratio of the fetuses . Ten litters usually yield 2 – 3 × 10 6 somatic cells of female embryonic gonads after the depletion of endogenous PGCs . Therefore , PGCLCs from three 96 - well plates and the somatic cells from ten litters yield 40 – 60 reconstituted ovaries . In almost half of the ovarian bursas that received two reconstituted ovaries , formation of donor - derived oocytes in developed follicles can be found at 4 weeks and 4 d after transplantation . Reconstituted ovaries at this stage vary in terms of the size and the number of follicles : on average around 30 GV oocytes can be obtained . As reported previously , most ( ~ 65 % ) of the oocytes derived from PGCLCs are isolated as denuded oocytes that are surrounded with cumulus cells only sparsely , if at all . Successful maturation and fertilization of PGCLC - derived oocytes are observed at 59 . 6 and 84 . 0 % , respectively 11 . PGCLC - derived oocytes may have a problem in fertilization ; our report showed that almost half of the fertilized eggs had a digynic triploid phenotype , which was caused by second polar body extrusion . In our experience , the success rate for obtaining PGCLC - derived offspring was 3 . 9 % of transferred two - cell embryos 29 . There may be some absorbed fetuses in the uterus when Caesarean section is performed . acknowleDGMents We would like to thank S . Ogushi , K . Kurimoto , H . Ohta , S . Shimamoto , S .
