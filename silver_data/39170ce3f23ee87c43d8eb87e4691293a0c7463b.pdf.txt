When crawling through the body amoeboid leukocytes must traverse complex three - dimensional tissue - landscapes obstructed by extracellular matrix and other cells , 15 raising the question how motile cells adapt to mechanical loads to overcome these obstacles . Here we reveal the spatio - temporal configuration of cortical actin - networks rendering amoeboid cells mechanosensitive in three - dimensions , independent of adhesive interactions with the microenvironment . In response to compression , Wiskott - Aldrich syndrom protein ( WASp ) assembles into dot - like structures acting as nucleation 20 sites for actin spikes that in turn push against the external load . High precision targeting 2 of WASp to objects as delicate as collagen fibers allows the cell to locally and instantaneously deform its viscoelastic surrounding in order to generate space for forward locomotion . Such pushing forces are essential for fast and directed leukocyte migration in fibrous and cell - packed tissues such as skin and lymph nodes . 5 In Brief : WASp - driven actin spikes counter compressive loads of crowded tissue - landscapes .

These can be dense fibrillar networks as in mesenchymal interstitia like the dermis or cell - packed environments such as organ parenchyma or lymphatic tissues ( Weigelin et al . , 2016 ) . Due to the limited availability of open space in such 5 environments , cells frequently experience compressive loads from their surroundings and this is particularly relevant for cells that actively migrate . Single - cell migration is an almost ubiquitous phenomenon in eukaryote biology and follows a continuum of biophysical strategies , with the mesenchymal mode on one pole and the amoeboid mode on the other ( Friedl and Wolf , 2010 ) . Amoeboid cells , such as 10 metastatic cancer cells or leukocytes migrate much faster and are more autonomous from their extracellular environment , than mesenchymal ( or epithelial ) cells , and rather than remodeling their environment they adapt to it ( Paluch et al . , 2016 ) . Survival and locomotion of amoeboid cells do not depend on adhesive ligands and they migrate efficiently even in ectopic environments or artificial materials ( Lammermann et al . , 2008 ; 15 Reversat et al . , 2020 ) . The quick shape changes that amoeboid cells owe their name to ( Amoeba , from Greek amoibe , meaning “change” ) are entirely autonomous from the environment and the cellular envelope behaves as an active surface that rapidly deforms even when the cell floats in suspension ( Barry and Bretscher , 2010 ) . These active adaptations of cell shape seem necessary to negotiate tissues because 20 ameboid cells do not digest their environment in order to create a path . Instead , in obstructive environments with heterogeneous geometry they effectively find the path of least resistance and chose larger pores over small ones ( Renkawitz et al . , 2019 ) . 4 Whenever there is no other choice and the cell faces a small pore , it actively deforms its cell body and / or transiently dilates the pore in order to pass through ( Pflicke and Sixt , 2009 ; Thiam et al . , 2016 ) . How ameboid cells generate forces underlying these processes is incompletely understood . In animal cells most intracellular forces are generated by the actin cytoskeleton , which 5 produces pulling forces via actomyosin contraction and pushing forces via actin polymerization . Both pulling and pushing are tightly regulated by mechanical feedback . In order to test the geometrical and mechanical features of its surrounding , mesenchymal cells probe their substrate by pulling on it ( Plotnikov and Waterman , 2013 ) . To do so they use their integrin - mediated adhesion sites as mechanosensitive organelles , which emit 10 signals in response to traction force . Substrate - probing by pulling forces seems less relevant for leukocyte migration . Whenever they move in an adhesion - free mode there is clearly no opportunity to pull . And whenever leukocytes do use adhesion receptors to generate friction with the substrate , they minimize traction : They tune their integrins so that they just transmit the extremely small traction forces required to move the cell body 15 forward ( Hons et al . , 2018 ) . Pushing forces are generated whenever actin filaments polymerize against the plasma membrane ( Mogilner , 2006 ) . The prototypic pushing structure is the lamellipodium , the flat actin protrusion that forms the leading front of most amoeboid and mesenchymal cells ( Krause and Gautreau , 2014 ) . Lamellipodial actin can adapt its protrusive force to the 20 counter - force it experiences , making the tip of a cell mechanosensitive ( Heinemann et al . , 2011 ) . However , lamellipodia are strictly two dimensional ( 2D ) leaflets and the molecular machinery that drives actin polymerization at the lamellipodial tip does not 5 support growth in the third dimension ( Fritz - Laylin et al . , 2018 ; Fritz - Laylin et al . , 2017 ) . Hence , lamellipodia can protrude into open spaces , but they are insufficient to create the active surface of an amoeboid cell that adapts and deforms in 3D . In order to do that , the cell requires both , mechanical sensitivity and activity across its whole cortex and not only at its lamellipodial tips . Here we use dendritic cells ( DCs ) and T cells as model systems 5 to address how cells respond to geometrical constraints of their environment . We investigate how these constraints are met by the molecular machinery that drives actin polymerization across the cellular cortex . RESULTS 10 Actin spikes form in response to mechanical loads of restrictive environments To study how amoeboid cells respond to compressive loads , we observed the migratory behavior of dendritic cells ( DCs ) under a patch of non - degradable agarose cast on a serum - coated coverslip ( Hons et al . , 2018 ) ( Figure 1A ) . In this reductionist approach , no pre - formed space is available and the highly flattened cells need to actively lift and deform 15 the agarose to create sufficient space between coverslip and agarose ( Figure 1A ) ( Laevsky and Knecht , 2003 ) . To precisely control the mechanical load that the cells have to counter , we adjusted the stiffnesses of the agarose around the range of cellular stiffness as measured by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Blumenthal et al . , 2020 ; Guimarães et al . , 2020 ) ( Figures 1A , S1A ) . With increasing load , the mean migratory 20 speed declined ( Figures 1B , C , S1B ) and the cells shifted from continuous locomotion to a stop and go pattern where cells collapsed and stalled after short stretches of movement ( Figure 1D , Movie S1 ) . Notably , time spent in arrest rose only slightly from 2 . 5 kPa ( below 6 cellular stiffness ) to 10 kPa ( slightly exceeding cellular stiffness ) but drastically at 17 . 5 kPa ( Figure 1D ) . Morphometric analysis of average cell shape revealed that at low ( 2 . 5 kPa ) and intermediate ( 10 kPa ) load , DCs adopted an elongated shape with a broad leading edge and a slender cell body ( Figure 1E , Movie S1 ) . Only under high load ( 17 . 5 kPa ) , average cell shape became substantially broadened ( Figures 1E , F , S1C ) . These 5 data indicate that DCs can successfully counter restrictive environments of stiffnesses that are in the range of cellular stiffness but frequently collapse when external load becomes exceedingly high . The cortical actin cytoskeleton largely determines the cells’ mechanical properties ( Chugh et al . , 2017 ) . To obtain a detailed map of actin distribution in DCs migrating under agarose we generated DCs expressing LifeAct - eGFP ( see 10 Methods ) . When migrating under agarose ( 10 kPa ) and imaged with high - speed confocal microscopy , DCs displayed small actin - rich foci that were scattered across the cell area , with peak intensities in the cell body ( Figure 1G , Movie S2 ) . Notably , actin spikes were restricted to regions of cellular confinement ( Figure 1G , Movie S2 ) . DCs migrating under non - adhesive conditions display a substantial retrograde flow of actin as both cortical and 15 lamellipodial actin slide backward in relation to the substrate ( Renkawitz et al . , 2009 ) . Actin foci evolved when cells migrated between ( inert ) agarose and passivated coverslips , demonstrating their independence of adhesive interactions with the substrate ( Figure 1G , Movie S2 ) . Actin foci moved together with this bulk actin flow , indicating linkage of the foci to the rest of the actin cortex ( Figures 1G , S1D ) . Over time , many actin foci evolved 20 into elongated stripes ( Figures 1H , S1E , Movie S2 ) and confocal z scans as well as correlated light and scanning electron microscopy ( CLEM ) indicated that these stripes corresponded to ridge - or spike - like surface structures that grow normal to the imaging 7 plane and thus protrude into the agarose ( Figures 1H , I , S1F ) . Ultrastructural analysis of serial sections suggested that actin - spikes generated pushing forces between the cell and the agarose overlay : when spikes where located on top of the nucleus , the protrusions into the agarose overlay were mirrored by an indentation in the nuclear lamina ( Figure 1J ) . 5 Collectively these experiments suggest that cells confined under a restrictive overlay respond by forming actin spikes that exert vertical forces against the compressive load . WASp - driven actin spikes polymerize orthogonal to WAVE - driven lamellipodia Formation and dynamics of the cortical actin cytoskeleton are mainly controlled by actin 10 nucleators of the formin and Arp2 / 3 families ( Bovellan et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , we tested how inhibition of formins and Arp2 / 3 with the small molecule inhibitors SMIFH2 and CK666 affect DC migration under agarose of intermediate ( 10kPa ) stiffness . While formin inhibition mildly reduced migration speed ( Figure S2A ) , Arp2 / 3 inhibition had a substantial effect with treated cells spending most of their time in arrest ( Figure S2B ) . 15 Notably , when mature DCs migrate in non - restrictive environments like cell - diameter sized microfluidic channels , inhibition of formins has similar effects on speed as it has under load while targeting Arp2 / 3 does not affect migration speed at all ( Vargas et al . , 2016 ) . These findings suggest that Arp2 / 3 mediated actin nucleation becomes rate - limiting for DC locomotion whenever the cell has to counter external loads , while it is 20 dispensable in non - restrictive environments . Hence , we focused on the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is activated by nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) of the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) and WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) 8 families ( Rotty et al . , 2013 ) . To test the contribution of these NPFs we analyzed DCs deficient in WASp or the WAVE complex subunit Hem1 , which in hematopoietic cells is essential for the stability of the pentameric WAVE complex ( Leithner et al . , 2016a ) . Both mutants showed reduced migration speeds ( Figures 2A , S2C , Movie S3 ) and increased time in arrest under agarose of intermediate stiffness ( Figure 2B ) . In line with the fact 5 that the WAVE complex exclusively drives horizontal forward protrusion at the very tip of the lamellipodium ( Derivery and Gautreau , 2010 ; Graziano and Weiner , 2014 ) , Hem1 - / - DCs were devoid of lamellipodia and instead formed multiple , spiky protrusions at the leading edge ( Figure S2D ) . Loss of lamellipodia renders DCs inefficient in exploring and navigating through complex environments ( Leithner et al . , 2016a ) , as indicated by 10 prolonged times in arrest ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast WASp - / - DCs formed normal lamellipodia ( Figure S2D ) . Morphometric analysis showed that despite their spiky protrusions the mean overall cell body shape of Hem1 - / - cells was comparable to WT cells , while WASp - / - cells were significantly broader ( Figure 2C ) . Hence , regarding shape and migratory pattern , WASp - / - cells under intermediate - load conditions phenocopied WT 15 cells under high - load conditions ( Figures 1B - F ) . Next , we were interested in the spatio - temporal organization of WAVE and WASp - dependent actin networks under compressive loads . While the WAVE complex ( detected with Abi1 - eGFP ) was strictly localized to the tip of lamellipodia ( Leithner et al . , 2016a ) , WASp ( detected with WASp - eGFP ) formed dots scattered across the cell surface , 20 matching the distribution and flow - pattern of actin foci ( Figures 2C , D ) . Deletion of WASp , but not the WAVE complex abrogated formation of actin foci and spikes as revealed by LifeAct - eGFP signal ( Figures 2E , F ) , and the few actin foci remaining in WASp - / - DCs 9 were transient and short - lived ( Figures 2G , S2E , Movie S3 ) . Ultrastructural analysis of serial sections and CLEM confirmed the morphological absence of spikes and ridges on the dorsal surface of WASp - / - DCs under confinement ( Figure 2H ) , while there were no apparent morphological differences to WT cells in the absence of a restrictive overlay ( Figures 1I , 2H ) . 5 Together , these data reveal a characteristic organization of branched actin networks in 3D : while WAVE - driven actin nucleation powers the horizontal forward protrusive component of cellular locomotion , WASp - driven actin nucleation counters the mechanical load of the overlay ( Figure 2I ) . 10 Vertical pushing facilitates locomotion by deforming restrictive environments We next used a cross - correlation approach to address if and how WASp - driven vertical pushing is embedded into the morphodynamic cycle of cellular locomotion . Acceleration of WT cells under agarose is initiated by leading - edge protrusion and elongation of the cell body ( Figure 3A , B , Movie S4 ) . Accordingly , cross - correlating speed with aspect 15 ratio revealed a clear positive and instantaneous correlation ( Figures 3C , S3A ) . Incorporating the number of cortical actin foci into the correlation showed that foci preceded acceleration by 1 - 2 min ( Figure 3C ) . This sequence suggested that actin foci are a prerequisite to lift the load of the agarose , which then facilitates forward protrusion . We next measured nuclear - projected area as a proxy for how much a cell is able to lift 20 the agarose : the nucleus of suspended DCs is approximately spherical , but naturally flattens with increasing confinement , making it a good indicator of cell height ( Figures 1A , S3B ) . WT DCs showed steady fluctuations of nuclear - projected area when migrating 10 under agarose ( Figure S3C , Movie S4 ) . Nuclear area was negatively cross - correlated with the appearance of actin foci on the surface area of the cell ( Figures 3C , D ) , supporting the concept that vertical WASp - driven protrusions lift the agarose so that the nucleus can expand vertically . Accordingly , cross - correlations between ( residual ) actin foci , speed and projected nuclear area were blunted in WASp - / - DCs , while the speed to 5 aspect ratio cross correlation was retained ( Figures 3F - H , Movie S4 ) . We next tested if the proposed morphodynamic cycle is indeed specific for migration in restrictive environments . We thus seeded DCs into PDMS - based ( non - deformable ) microfluidic devices with a constant height of 5 µm , which can be passaged without substrate deformation . Here , migration parameters of WASp - / - mutants were indistinguishable from 10 WT cells ( Figure S3D , Movie S5 ) . To further challenge migration in non - deformable environments we reduced pillar spacings to 1 . 5 µm - sized constrictions ( Figure 3I ) . DCs squeezing through non - deformable constrictions recruited WASp and actin to sites of self - imposed compression ( Figure 3J , Movie S5 ) . We therefore tested if WASp - dependent pushing forces are required for self - deformation of the cell body and squeezing through 15 non - deformable constrictions ( Thiam et al . , 2016 ) . When encountering a constriction both WT and WASp - / - DCs arrested to squeeze their cell body through the pore . Importantly , mean time of passage of WASp - / - cells was not prolonged , but rather slightly reduced , indicating a negligible role of WASp - dependent pushing forces when countering non - deformable obstacles ( Figure 3K ) . Together , we show that WASp - driven vertical pushing 20 forces counter mechanical load and displace deformable microenvironments to generate space for the cell to enter into the protrusive phase of locomotion . 11 WASp - driven actin polymerization is triggered by mechanical loading We showed that WASp - driven vertical protrusions are ( 1 ) temporally correlated with the mechanical response and ( 2 ) required for countering external mechanical load . We next addressed causality and tested if actin foci form in response to a mechanical trigger or if they develop spontaneously . 5 We seeded LifeAct - eGFP expressing DCs on poly - l - lysine coated coverslips and locally pinched the cell body with the blunted tip of a microneedle ( Figure 4A ) . Within seconds after indenting the cell , the actin reporter increased around the pipette tip of WT DCs , leaving behind a localized actin cloud ( Gerard et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4B , Movie S6 ) . This mechanically induced burst of actin polymerization was substantially decreased in WASp - 10 / - DCs ( Figure 4C ) . This finding supported a role of WASp in polymerizing actin in response to mechanical loading ( Figure 1G ) . Leukocytes migrating within tissues actively bump into subcellular , usually submicron - sized obstacles such as collagen fibers that restrict their passage and therefore locally pinch the cell body . We engineered the geometric aspect of this scenario in vitro and confined cells onto inert substrates with a 15 ridged topography matching the size of aligned collagen fibrils ( Figures 4D , S3A , B ) . This setup allowed the precise localization of the fluorescent signals . We found that ridges of 600 nm height ( and 250 nm width ) induced actin foci that matched the pattern of ridges ( Figure 4E , Movie S6 ) . Notably , these foci exclusively formed on top of ridges and were virtually absent in the interjacent grooves ( Figures 4E , S4C , Movie S6 ) . This response 20 was independent of adhesive interactions as actin foci formed efficiently on passivated substrates , where actin foci moved with the retrograde actin flow ( Figure 4E ) . WASp - eGFP followed the same dynamic pattern , with sharply delineated dots precisely 12 matching the ridge structure ( Figure 4F , Movie S6 ) . Importantly in WASp - deficient cells , the formation of actin foci on the ridges was virtually abrogated ( Figures 4E , S4C , Movie S6 ) . These data demonstrate that DCs show a highly localized response to mechanical indentation with rapid recruitment of WASp , which triggers polymerization of actin . Previous studies have shown that mechanical load can induce global stiffening of the 5 cellular cortex , which is dependent on actin reorganization ( Hu et al . , 2019 ) . To test if load - induced actin polymerization increases cortical stiffness in DCs we indented DCs immobilized on poly - l - lysine with the tip of an AFM cantilever and measured cellular stiffness . WASp - deficient DCs showed a significantly reduced cortical stiffness , indicating a crucial role of WASp in adapting cell mechanics to mechanical confinement ( Figures 10 4G , S4D ) . In summary , we demonstrate that cells respond to mechanical load by locally polymerizing actin , a process requiring WASp . Deformation of collagen fibers is required for migration in fibrous environments We next challenged our findings in physiological environments . To initiate adaptive 15 immunity , DCs need to migrate from the site of antigen retrieval to the draining lymph node ( LN ) ( Worbs et al . , 2017 ) , which requires fast transit through 3D tissues with complex geometry and molecular composition . DCs can reach the lymph node without proteolytically generating a path ( Pflicke and Sixt , 2009 ) , suggesting that they predominantly use a mechanical strategy . We therefore hypothesized that efficient 20 migration in tissues requires WASp - driven actin to mechanically create space in dense 3D matrices . To test this , we first competitively injected WT and WASp - / - mature DCs into footpads of wildtype recipient mice to measure homing to draining popliteal LNs ( Figure 13 S5A ) . After 24h , recruitment of WASp - / - DCs was significantly reduced compared to WT controls , indicating a crucial role of WASp dependent actin polymerization in vivo and confirming previous reports by others ( Bouma et al . , 2007 ; de Noronha et al . , 2005 ; Pulecio et al . , 2008 ; Snapper et al . , 2005 ) . To study the mechanism underlying impaired migration in fibrous 3D microenvironments 5 in detail , we then used fibrillar collagen , the most abundant matrix scaffold of mammalian tissues , as a proxy for the interstitial matrix . Collagen gels were polymerized at densities resulting in pore sizes substantially smaller than the minimal cross - section of deformed DCs ( Lang et al . , 2015 ; Renkawitz et al . , 2019 ; Thiam et al . , 2016 ; Wolf et al . , 2013 ) . Consequently , chemotactic locomotion under these conditions should depend on the 10 deformation of obstructive fibers ( Figure 5A ) . Indeed , fast confocal imaging revealed that DCs locally displaced collagen fibers , thereby generating space for the passage of the cell body . Locally , the deformation of collagen fibers was accompanied by a burst in actin polymerization ( Figures 5B , C , Movie S7 ) . We then performed bulk measurements of large numbers of DCs and found that in low - density collagen gels , where pore sizes 15 between fibers are sufficiently large to allow unconstrained locomotion , WASp - / - cells were not significantly slower than WT controls ( Figure 5D ) . With increasing collagen gel densities ( decreased pore size and increased stiffness ) , DCs were more reliant on displacing fibers to generate space ( Figure S5B ) , became substantially slower ( Figure 5D ) , and often arrested ( Figure 5E ) , indicating that matrix deformation became a rate 20 limiting parameter . Accordingly , under these conditions , WASp - deficient DCs were less efficient in recruiting actin to restrictive fibers ( Figures 5C , S5C ) . Together , our data show that cells require Wasp - dependent pushing to mechanically create space in dense 3D 14 matrices and provide a mechanistic explanation for impaired migration of WASp - / - DCs in vivo ( Figure S5A ) . Orthogonal pushing drives T cell migration in crowded lymph nodes WASp deficiency affects multiple hematopoietic lineages however , the dominant 5 phenotype of WAS patients is a congenital immunodeficiency due to defective T - cell functions ( Ochs , 2001 ) . Cell migration is inevitably linked to activation of naïve T cells , as T cells need to constantly scan cell - packed secondary lymphoid tissues to search for cognate antigen on antigen presenting cells ( Krummel et al . , 2016 ) . While WASp plays an established role in T cell development and immune synapse formation its role in 10 interstitial T cell migration remained unclear ( Thrasher and Burns , 2010 ) . To test if the mechanism we established for DCs is relevant for lymphocytes , we purified naïve T cells from WASp - / - mice and confined them under agarose ( 10kPa ) . Locomotion was significantly impaired compared to WT controls and cells were frequently arrested under the load of the compressive overlay ( Figure 8A , Movie 6 ) . Similar to confined DCs , WT 15 T cells formed highly dynamic actin foci traveling backward with the retrograde actin flow ( Figure 6B ) . These actin foci were virtually absent in WASp - / - cells ( Figure 6B , Movie S6 ) . Subcellular mechanical loading with both micropipette tips ( Figure S6A , Movie 8 ) and nanometer sized ridges ( Figures 6C , S6B , Movie S8 ) triggered the formation of WASp - dependent actin foci . Finally , cortical stiffness measured by submicron indentation 20 with the tip of an AFM cantilever was significantly reduced in WASp - / - compared to WT cells ( Figures 6D , S6C ) . Together , these data support a crucial role of WASp in the cortical mechanics of T cells . Next , we adoptively transferred labeled WT and WASp - / - 15 naïve T cells into WT recipient mice ( Figure 6E ) . Since WASp - / - T cells show unimpaired homing to popliteal lymph nodes ( Snapper et al . , 2005 ) , these experimental conditions allowed us to compare intranodal migration of both genotypes side - by - side ( Figure 6E , Movie S9 ) . WASp - / - T cells were able to reach maximum speeds comparable to WT controls , indicating that WASp was not strictly required for locomotion of T - cells in vivo 5 ( Figure S6D ) . However , a significantly larger fraction of cells showed periods of minimal displacement ( < 2 . 5 µm in 1 min ) ( Figure 6F ) , resulting in an overall reduced mean speed ( Figures 6G , S6E ) . These data confirm that WASp - dependent actin polymerization is of general relevance for 3D migration under compressive loads across both myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic lineages and provide a mechanistic framework to defective cell 10 migration observed in X - linked WAS ( Bouma et al . , 2009 ) . DISCUSSION First described in 1937 , WAS is one of the most thoroughly investigated severe congenital immunodeficiencies ( Ochs , 2001 ) . WAS patients suffer from thromobocytopenia , 15 eczema , and recurrent bacterial infections . Although underlying defects in cell - cell interactions and motility of the hematopoietic compartment have been attributed to the well - established function of WASp as one of the upstream activators of Arp2 / 3 nucleated actin polymerization , the precise cell biology behind WAS remained obscure ( Graziano and Weiner , 2014 ; Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Thrasher and Burns , 2010 ) . We here show 20 that WASp drives cortical actin polymerization in the third dimension and that it does so in a mechanosensitive manner . WASp dependent forces act orthogonal to the direction of cellular locomotion , and they are dispensable when the cell migrates in environments 16 where the pore size is sufficiently large for the cell body to passage . WASp becomes rate - limiting for migration when the cell needs to pass through restrictive environments that require the cell to deform its viscoelastic surrounding . WASp assembles into dot - like structures that are embedded into the actin cortex and act as nucleation sites for spikes and ridges that then protrude against the external obstacle ( Figure S7 ) . 5 This function of WASp contrasts with that of the Arp2 / 3 - activating WAVE complex . The WAVE complex does not assemble in discrete spots but in traveling waves : as WAVE activity is self - amplifying and at the same time negatively regulated by polymerized actin , it travels and expands as a linear front of actin assembly ( Graziano and Weiner , 2014 ) . Such an “in - plane of the membrane” polymerization pattern only allows protrusion at the 10 tip of a strictly flat lamellipodium , where the sheet of plasma membrane curves to form an envelope . Accordingly , the orientation of Arp2 / 3 branches in lamellipodia is exclusively horizontal ( Svitkina , 2018 ) . WASp lacks the self - organizing feature of the WAVE complex . It stays confined in dot - like assemblies , and its lateral movement seems restricted to passive co - migration within the surrounding cortex . This lack of self - organization might 15 allow WASp activity to “remain on target” when the cell pushes against a target as delicate and small as a collagen fiber . When cells migrated on the nanotopographies , the precision with which the WASp dots located to the ridges was remarkable and suggested that WASp assembles in response to a highly localized signal . Importantly , this putative signal is independent of adhesive interactions , which is well in line with the amoeboid principle 20 that can work in the absence of any cognate adhesive interaction with a substrate . Topographical changes of the plasma membrane as sensed e . g . , by BAR domain - 17 containing proteins are the most attractive candidates for such an alternative sensory function ( Lou et al . , 2019 ; Suetsugu and Gautreau , 2012 ) . How cells adapt to compressive load in 3D tissue environments is still incompletely understood . Recent studies proposed an evasion reflex in response to cellular compression : upon deformation of the nucleus cells increase their cortical contractility to 5 move away and squeeze out from tight spaces or crowded tissue regions ( Lomakin et al . , 2020 ; Venturini et al . , 2020 ) . To reach their target sites , directionally migrating leukocytes , however , often need to enter and traverse tissues of high density and switch to an invasive , rather than an escape program is mandatory to remain on track . Formation of stiff actin spikes that push against the obstructing barrier may reflect the first , 10 instantaneous response of a cell adopting an invasive mode of migration . Indeed , until to date , one of the best - established functions of WASp and its non - hematopoietic isoform N - WASP are invasive podosomes and invadosomes ( Mooren et al . , 2012 ; Murphy and Courtneidge , 2011 ) . Although on the cellular scale , the WASp function we describe has little to do with an invasive process , the mechanistic aspect of the WASp - driven actin foci 15 is similar to an extremely rudimentary and stalled podosome - driven invasion process . Podosomes are adhesive organelles , which are composed of a WASp and Arp2 / 3 containing protrusive core , surrounded by an adhesive ring - structure composed of integrins and their force coupling adaptors ( van den Dries et al . , 2019 ) . A further defining feature of podosomes is their matrix - degrading activity , due to a podosome - targeted 20 delivery of vesicles containing proteolytic enzymes of the matrix metalloproteinase family ( Linder , 2007 ) . Although in transcellular extravasating lymphocytes ( Carman et al . , 2007 ) , immunological synapses ( Kumari et al . , 2015 ) and cells that undergo fusion ( Sens et al . , 18 2010 ) , non - proteolytic podosome - like organelles were described , these structures were strictly coupled to ( cell - cell ) adhesions that presumably counter the pushing force of the protrusive actin - core . It seems plausible that in amoeboid migrating leukocytes , where integrins are either inactive or transmit horizontal traction forces ( Hons et al . , 2018 ) but never vertical adhesion forces , WASp - mediated protrusive foci are not locked in place by 5 an adhesive ring and thus lack a maturation signal that turns them into degradative structures . Notably , work in invasive C elegans anchor cells showed that in WASp - dependent sites of basement membrane invasion , protrusive forces and proteolytic degradation synergize to drive barrier - penetration ( Caceres et al . , 2018 ) . Upon inhibition of proteolysis , invasion can partially proceed in an entirely mechanically driven fashion 10 ( Kelley et al . , 2019 ) . The protrusive actin foci we describe also share some features with early stages of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , where the positive curvature of the plasma membrane is associated with WASp - driven actin polymerization ( Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ) . Actin polymerization on clathrin coated pits ( CCP ) is oriented normal to the cell surface , 15 allowing it to push the CCP inward ( Collins et al . , 2011 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . This orientation is consistent with our findings that WASp plays a unique role in driving cortical actin polymerization in the third dimension . Of note , work in MDA - MB - 231 cells showed that the endocytic machinery with its clathrin - based curved scaffolds can be diverted to wrap the plasma membrane around collagen fibers and to support mesenchymal cell migration 20 ( Elkhatib et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , the protrusive actin structures we describe share features with early stages of endocytosis as well as early stages of podosome formation . Together , our data support the general notion that WASp - driven actin polymerization mediates 19 cellular mechanics acting orthogonal to the plasma membrane rendering cells mechanosensitive in 3D .
