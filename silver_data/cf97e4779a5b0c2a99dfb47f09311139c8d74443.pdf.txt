Both the spin − orbit coupling and the energy di ﬀ erence between the S 1 and T 1 states ( Δ E ST ) are evaluated , at the density functional theory ( DFT ) and time - dependent DFT levels . The calculated UISC rates and Δ E ST values are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data . Our results underline that small Δ E ST values and sizable spin − orbit coupling matrix elements have to be simultaneously realized in order to facilitate UISC and ultimately TADF . Importantly , the spatial separation of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the emitter , a widely accepted strategy for the design of TADF molecules , does not necessarily lead to a su ﬃ cient reduction in Δ E ST ; in fact , either a signi ﬁ cant charge - transfer ( CT ) contribution to the T 1 state or a minimal energy di ﬀ erence between the local - excitation and charge - transfer triplet states is required to achieve a small Δ E ST . Also , having S 1 and T 1 states of a di ﬀ erent nature is found to strongly enhance spin − orbit coupling , which is consistent with the El - Sayed rule for ISC rates . Overall , our results indicate that having either similar energies for the local - excitation and charge - transfer triplet states or the right balance between a substantial CT contribution to T 1 and somewhat di ﬀ erent natures of the S 1 and T 1 states , paves the way toward UISC enhancement and thus TADF e ﬃ ciency improvement . 1 . INTRODUCTION Organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) have demonstrated their practical utility due to highly e ﬃ cient electroluminescence , lightweight , mechanical ﬂ exibility , as well as possibility of solution processing and low - cost manufacture . 1 − 5 Devices based on vacuum processing have now entered the market of full - color ﬂ at - panel displays 6 and solid - state lighting applica - tions . 7 In an OLED device , the light - emitting molecules are electronically excited upon recombination of charges injected from the electrodes . Since the spins of the injected charges are uncorrelated , singlet and triplet excitons are generated in a 25 % : 75 % ratio , assuming equal e ﬃ ciency of charge recombi - nation and neglecting other processes that may a ﬀ ect spin statistics . In order to fabricate more e ﬃ cient OLEDs , it is critical to ﬁ nd ways to harness the energy of the triplet excitons that represent dark states in purely organic systems . To this end , phosphorescent OLEDs have been widely studied due to their charge - to - photon internal quantum e ﬃ ciency ( IQE ) that can reach as high as 100 % 1 because of strong spin − orbit coupling ( SOC ) enabled by the presence of heavy metal atoms such as iridium and platinum ; however , the use of these rare elements inevitably leads to high device fabrication costs . 8 , 9 In addition , deep - blue phosphors with long lifetimes still remain to be developed . Thus , alternatives that could be e ﬃ cient in terms of light emission , cost , and chemical stability are highly desirable . The device performance of purely organic , ﬂ uorescent OLEDs can be enhanced via a number of processes in ﬂ uencing spin statistics , which include triplet − triplet annihilation ( TTA ) 10 or exciton - polaron interaction ( EPI ) . 11 For instance , TTA ( P - type delayed ﬂ uorescence ) , albeit detrimental to phosphorescent OLEDs , can in principle improve the IQE of ﬂ uorescent OLEDs from 25 % to 62 . 5 % . 12 Also , in a recent report , 11 triplet - polaron interaction was suggested to generate more singlet excitons and hence to improve the performance of ﬂ uorescent OLEDs . Nevertheless , none of these processes can fully harness triplet excitons for light emission . Furthermore , both TTA and EPI are bimolecular processes and therefore more challenging to control in devices .

Soc . 2017 , 139 , 4042 − 4051 In contrast , although its e ﬃ ciency can be in ﬂ uenced by the surroundings , 13 , 14 thermally activated delayed ﬂ uorescence ( TADF ) is basically a unimolecular process and can be controlled by the manipulation of the intrinsic electronic properties of the emitter . The TADF mechanism relies on an intramolecular up - conversion intersystem crossing ( UISC ) from a triplet excited state to a singlet excited state , which can lead to full harnessing of the triplet excitons . 15 In the systems that demonstrate UISC , we note that down - conversion ISC ( DISC ) from singlet to triplet excited states also occur ; however , DISC competes against light emission from the singlet excited state , which re - establishes the equilibrium between singlet and triplet excited states and can eventually give rise to total depopulation of the triplet excitons provided nonradiative decay from the T 1 state is e ﬀ ectively suppressed . 16 Adachi et al . reported OLEDs employing 4CzIPN ( 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 - tetra ( 9 H - carbazol - 9 - yl ) isophthalonitrile ) , a TADF material , with an IQE as high as nearly 100 % . 17 Since an understanding of the relationship between UISC and TADF can allow the design of improved emitters , numerous studies have been conducted on this topic . 13 , 14 , 16 , 18 − 22 In order to achieve e ﬃ cient UISC and thus TADF , ensuring a small energy di ﬀ erence between the lowest singlet and lowest triplet excited states , Δ E ST , is essential . In this regard , TADF molecules have often been designed following a strategy such that their highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) are spatially separated ( for instance , the former localized on an electron - donor moiety and the latter , on an electron - acceptor moiety ) in order to minimize their wave function overlap and thereby the exchange energy , K . However , unless both the singlet and triplet excited states then correspond to a transition from HOMO to LUMO ( which in itself carries negative implications in terms of oscillator strengths of the relevant optical transitions ) , this strategy is bound to fail . Indeed , for triplet excited states , in general , the larger the K value is , the larger their stabilization becomes 23 , 24 as a result , despite the spatial separation of their HOMO and LUMO wave functions , for instance , the T 1 states of many ambipolar host molecules for blue OLED applications turn out to correspond to local excitations ( LE ) within a particular molecular subunit rather than charge - transfer ( CT ) transitions from the electron donor - based HOMO to the electron acceptor - based LUMO . 25 − 27 Thus , having the HOMO and LUMO on separate molecular subunits is not a su ﬃ cient condition to minimize Δ E ST . In addition , the spin − orbit couplings ( SOC ) in TADF molecules ( albeit expected to be much smaller in magnitude than in heavy - metal containing phosphors ) should still have signi ﬁ cant values in order to ensure e ﬃ cient UISC . To the best of our knowledge , however , studies on SOC in TADF materials are scarce . 28 − 30 Given the importance of UISC in TADF e ﬃ ciency , systematic investigations are thus highly warranted . Here , we report the results of our calculations on Δ E ST , SOC , and UISC rate constants ( k UISC ) for a series of representative TADF molecules : 4 , 5 - di ( 9 H - carbazol - 9 - yl ) - phthalonitrile ( 2CzPN ) ; 9 , 9 ″ - ( 6 - phenyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine - 2 , 4 - diyl ) - bis ( ( 9 H - 3 , 9 ′ - bicarbazole ) ) ( CC2TA ) ; 12 , 12 ′ - ( 6 - ( [ 1 , 1 ′ - biphen - yl ] - 4 - yl ) - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine - 2 , 4 - diyl ) bis ( 11 - phenyl - 11 , 12 - dihydroindolo [ 2 , 3 - a ] carbazole ) ( PIC - TRZ ) ; 10 - ( 4 - ( 4 , 6 - di - phenyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazin - 2 - yl ) phenyl ) - 10 H - phenoxazine ( PXZ - TRZ ) ; 10 - phenyl - 10 H - spiro [ acridine - 9 , 9 ′ - ﬂ uorene ] - 2 ′ , 7 ′ - dicar - bonitrile ( ACRFLCN ) ; 2 ′ , 7 ′ - bis ( di - p - tolylamino ) - 9 , 9 ′ - spirobi - [ ﬂ uorene ] - 2 , 7 - dicarbonitrile ( Spiro - CN ) ; 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 - tetra ( 9 H - car - bazol - 9 - yl ) isophthalonitrile ( 4CzIPN ) ; 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 - tetra ( 3 , 6 - di - methyl - 9 H - carbazol - 9 - yl ) isophthalonitrile ( 4CzIPN - Me ) ; 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 - tetra ( 9 H - carbazol - 9 - yl ) phthalonitrile ( 4CzPN ) ; 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 - tetra ( 9 H - carbazol - 9 - yl ) terephthalonitrile ( 4CzTPN ) , and 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 - tetrakis ( 3 , 6 - dimethyl - 9 H - carbazol - 9 - yl ) - terephthalonitrile ( 4CzTPN - Me ) . Their chemical structures are depicted in Figure 1 . For the sake of comparison , we also investigated a couple of non - TADF molecules : 4 , 4 ′ - bis - ( carbazol - 9 - yl ) - p - biphenyl ( CBP ) and N , N ′ - diphenyl - N , N ′ - bis ( 1 - naphthyl ) - 1 , 10 - biphenyl - 4 , 4 ′ - diamine ( α - NPD ) . Our dis - cussion will underline the factors a ﬀ ecting Δ E ST and SOC , in particular the natures of the relevant singlet and triplet excited states , as well as features that can aid in the design of more e ﬃ cient TADF molecules . 2 . THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS Up - Conversion Intersystem Crossing Rate . The UISC rate constant , k UISC , can be computed in the framework of the Fermi Golden rule : 31 , 32 π ρ = ℏ | ⟨ | ̂ | ⟩ | k S H T 2 UISC FC 1 SO 1 2 ( 1 ) where ⟨ S 1 | H ̂ SO | T 1 ⟩ is the SOC matrix element between the S 1 and T 1 states , and ρ FC denotes the Franck − Condon - weighted density of states . The ρ FC terms were evaluated in the framework of Marcus − Levich − Jortner theory : 33 , 34 Figure 1 . Chemical structures of the molecules explored in this study .

Since the initial state for UISC is a triplet state ( most often T 1 but sometimes T 2 ) , all the calculations associated with the UISC rates are carried out at the relevant triplet - state geometries . To set the stage for the remainder of our discussion , Figure 2 summarizes how a range of Δ E ST values ( between 0 . 0 and 0 . 4 eV ) and of SOC matrix elements ( between 0 . 1 and 0 . 8 cm − 1 ) , according to eqs 1 and 2 , in ﬂ uences the range of k UISC rates for given λ M values ( vide infra ) . We note that since Δ E ST is positive in general , ρ FC is a decreasing function with respect to Δ E ST . As expected , an enhanced SOC and a small Δ E ST lead to fast UISC rates that can reach up to 10 8 s − 1 . A smaller λ M value is also found to be more favorable in the case of molecules with a su ﬃ ciently small Δ E ST ( ≤ 0 . 16 eV in this case , see Figure 2 ) . 35 In addition , for molecules with Δ E ST larger than 0 . 4 eV , direct UISC from T 1 to S 1 states and hence TADF becomes negligible even with a SOC matrix element value as large as 0 . 8 cm − 1 . 20 , 21 , 28 − 30 , 36 Importantly , a small reduction in Δ E ST on the order of 50 meV can increase k UISC by approximately 1 order of magnitude . Likewise , only a few tenths of cm − 1 increase in the SOC matrix element value is su ﬃ cient to speed up UISC by over 1 order of magnitude . Thus , an in - depth understanding of the characteristics of the Δ E ST and SOC terms is critical . Molecular Electronic - Structure Calculations and Δ E ST . All the molecules were optimized in their ground - state ( S 0 ) at the DFT level of theory using the B3LYP hybrid functional 37 − 39 and 6 - 31G ( d ) basis set . The geometries in the excited states were optimized using the CAM - B3LYP functional ; the S 1 - state geometries were optimized at the TDDFT level , while the T 1 geometries were obtained via spin - unrestricted SCF calculations ; the T 2 - state geometries were also optimized at the TDDFT level where relevant . In order to account for matrix e ﬀ ects in the condensed phase and to allow a better comparison to available experimental data , 40 all calculations were conducted using the polarizable continuum model ( PCM ) , taking the dielectric constant for toluene ( ε = 2 . 37 ) as reference . 41 As described in earlier works , 42 , 43 the excitation energies were calculated by employing the gap - tuned range - separated LC - ω PBE functional with the 6 - 31 + G ( d ) basis set within the Tamm − Danco ﬀ approximation ( TDA ) ; the optimal range - separation ω values were determined by minimizing J 2 as follows : 42 − 45 ∑ ε = + + + = J N i N i [ ( ) IP ( ) ] i 2 0 1 H 2 ( 3 ) where IP and ε H denote the ionization potential and HOMO energy of a given molecule , respectively , and N is the number of electrons in the molecule . We refer , hereafter , to the LC - ω PBE functional tuned ω value as LC - ω * PBE . The optimal ω values ( Table S4 in Supporting Information ) were taken from the previous report by Sun et al . 42 except for 4CzIPN - Me , which was calculated in this work ; all other calculations including geometry optimizations were carried out again here . The adiabatic Δ E ST values , de ﬁ ned as the di ﬀ erence between the energies of the potential minima for the S 1 and T 1 states , were then evaluated for all the molecules . Natural transition orbital ( NTO ) analyses were performed to examine the nature of the excited states . 46 The excited - state wave functions were further exploited to quantitatively evaluate their local - excitation ( LE ) and charge - transfer ( CT ) contributions , as discussed elsewhere ( see also Supporting Information ) . 47 All the calculations described above were carried out with the Gaussian 09 code . 48 Spin − OrbitCouplings . The SOC matrix elecment , ⟨ S 1 | H ̂ SO | T 1 ⟩ , is calculated by considering that the three T 1 substates ( m = 0 , ± 1 ) are degenerate , i . e . , ⟨ | ̂ | ⟩ S H T 1 SO 1 = ∑ ⟨ | ̂ | ⟩ = ± S H T m m 0 , 1 1 SO 1 2 . 49 The spin − orbit coupling operator within the zeroth - order regular approximation ( ZORA ) is written as 50 − 52 σ ̂ = − · ∇ × H c c V V p ( 2 ) ( ) SO 2 2 2 ( 4 ) where σ represents the Pauli spin matrix vector ; p , the linear momentum operator ; c , the speed of light ; and V , the Kohn − Sham potential . In the present calculations , SOC was treated as a perturbation based on the scalar relativistic ( SR ) orbitals after SCF and TDDFT calculations ( pSOC - TDDFT ) ; 52 TZP , the Slater - type all - electron basis set , was used for all the atoms . 53 In addition , matrix e ﬀ ects were also considered by using here the COSMO continuum solvation model . 54 Various exchange - correlation functionals , e . g . , B3LYP , PBE0 , BHandHLYP , and M06 - 2X , were tested 55 and PBE0 was chosen since the results were found to be most consistent with those obtained with the LC - ω * PBE functional that was employed for the electronic - structure calculations ( see Tables S5 and S6 ) . The SOC matrix elements for all the molecules were calculated using the ADF2014 package . 56 Reorganization Energy . In the evaluation of k UISC , the reorganization energy ( λ ) is one of the important factors that must be estimated . For a few representative molecules , the vibration relaxation energy of the S 1 state and the associated S factor were calculated using the DUSHIN program developed by Reimers . 57 The computed e ﬀ ective reorganization energies due to high - frequency , nonclassical intramolecular vibrations ( S · ℏ ω eff ) are found to be ca . 0 . 01 eV for α - NPD and 0 . 19 eV for PXZ - TRZ , whereas the total intramolecular λ for those molecules are computed to be ca . 0 . 12 and 0 . 39 eV , respectively ( see Supporting Information , Table S2 ) . Thus , overall , the Marcus reorganization energy ( λ M in eq 2 ) due to low - frequency intramolecular vibrations and the surrounding medium - induced relaxations can be expected to fall in the range ∼ 0 . 1 − 0 . 2 eV . 34 , 58 In addition , S factor is found to be safely ignored for the larger molecules . The theoretical background for λ and the e ﬀ ect of the neglect of S factor on the UISC rate are discussed in the Supporting Information in more detail . 3 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We begin ﬁ rst with the theoretical evaluation of the UISC rates for the organic emitters in this study and an assessment of their reliability . We then discuss in detail the factors a ﬀ ecting these Figure 2 .

The k UISC rates calculated at 300 K along with the Δ E ST and SOC matrix element values are reported in Table 1 . The computed rates are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data , especially given that we arbitrarily set the λ M value to either 0 . 1 or 0 . 2 eV and generally neglected UISC via higher electronic states . However , we considered UISC via the T 2 state for the cases of PIC - TRZ , PXZ - TRZ , and Spiro - CN , where the energy di ﬀ erence between the S 1 and T 2 states is small and the corresponding SOC matrix element is signi ﬁ cant ( vide infra ) . Importantly , the experimental and calculated k UISC values are of the same order of magnitude . At 300 K , for instance , k UISC for 2CzPN is experimentally measured as 5 . 4 × 10 3 s − 1 while the calculated values is 2 . 1 × 10 3 s − 1 with λ M of 0 . 1 eV ; the calculated k UISC for CC2TA with the same λ M is just 1 . 5 times smaller than the experimental value ( 1 . 1 × 10 5 s − 1 vs 1 . 6 × 10 5 s − 1 ) . In addition , the k UISC values for 4CzIPN and 4CzIPN - Me are calculated to be some 1 . 8 and 1 . 3 times larger with a 0 . 2 eV λ M than the experimental data ( 4 . 9 × 10 6 s − 1 vs 2 . 7 × 10 6 s − 1 for the former ; 1 . 0 × 10 6 s − 1 vs 7 . 7 × 10 5 s − 1 for the latter ) . The series of molecules we have considered in this study have Δ E ST and SOC matrix element values in the ranges from 0 . 00 to 0 . 88 eV and from 0 . 00 to 1 . 54 cm − 1 , respectively ( we recall that the conversion factor eV and cm − 1 is 1 eV = 8066 cm − 1 ) . The calculated k UISC values for the non - TADF molecules that have a large Δ E ST are found to be negligible . Despite its relatively large SOC matrix element of 0 . 68 cm − 1 , for instance , α - NTD is unlikely to undergo UISC directly from T 1 to S 1 at room temperature due to its high Δ E ST value ( 0 . 76 eV ) . We note that , among the molecules with moderate values of Δ E ST , this parameter appears to play a more important role in determining k UISC than SOC . For example , 2CzPN exhibits larger Δ E ST and SOC matrix element values than CC2TA ( 0 . 25 eV vs 0 . 16 eV for Δ E ST and 0 . 74 cm − 1 vs 0 . 30 cm − 1 for SOC matrix element , respectively ) . However , k UISC has been measured to be about 30 times larger for CC2TA , 18 , 59 and our calculation also points to UISC being about 50 times faster with λ M set at 0 . 1 eV . Expectedly , a stronger SOC enhances the UISC rate when the Δ E ST values are similar ; thus , the UISC rate of ACRFLCN is about twice higher than that of 4CzIPN ( 4 . 3 × 10 7 s − 1 vs 1 . 8 × 10 7 s − 1 with λ M of 0 . 1 eV ) while the Δ E ST values are close ( 20 vs 10 meV ) . The 4CzIPN molecule exhibits a substantially smaller Δ E ST than 4CzTPN ( 10 vs 60 meV ) , but the UISC for the former is twice as slow as for the latter ( 4 . 4 × 10 7 s − 1 with λ M of 0 . 1 eV ) , which is due to its three Table 1 .

Interestingly , we ﬁ nd that UISC can occur on a fast time scale shorter than 100 ns at 300 K when the molecules are simultaneously on the lower side of the Δ E ST range and higher side of the SOC range . This is the case for ACRFLCN , 4CzPN , and 4CzTPN . Their Δ E ST values are calculated to be 20 , 0 , and 60 meV , respectively , and their SOC matrix element values , 0 . 46 , 0 . 61 , and 0 . 81 cm − 1 . It is also worth paying attention to Spiro - CN . This molecule has a negligible SOC matrix element between the S 1 and T 1 states ( 0 . 01 cm − 1 ; see Table 2 ) ; hence , the corresponding UISC is as slow as 3 . 0 × 10 4 s − 1 with λ M equal to 0 . 1 eV . However , the S 1 and T 2 states are close in energy with the T 2 state higher by 27 meV , and the energy di ﬀ erence between the T 1 and T 2 states is as small as 34 meV ( Table 2 ) . The computed SOC matrix element values and ISC rate ( λ M = 0 . 1 eV ) between the T 2 and S 1 state are 0 . 61 cm − 1 and 4 . 8 × 10 7 s − 1 , respectively , with the latter value 3 orders of magnitude larger than for the process via T 1 . Likewise , the T 2 states of PIC - TRZ and PXZ - TRZ are close in energy to the S 1 state ( 100 and 8 meV , respectively ) and have LE character ( vide infra ) ; as a result , they have larger SOCs with the S 1 states than their T 1 counterparts ( 0 . 28 vs 0 . 11 cm − 1 for PIC - TRZ and 1 . 54 vs 0 . 26 cm − 1 for PXZ - TRZ , see Table 2 ) , which leads to a 1 order of magnitude increase in k UISC . Therefore , it can be expected that these molecules undergo UISC more signi ﬁ cantly via their T 2 state . 28 − 30 As an interesting counter - example , ACRFLCN also possesses T 1 and T 2 states with a very small energy di ﬀ erence of ca . 5 meV ( Table 2 ) . The SOC matrix element between the T 2 and S 1 states is , however , much smaller than that between the T 1 and S 1 states ( 0 . 01 vs 0 . 46 cm − 1 , Table 2 ) ; such a small SOC results in a k UISC rate from T 2 to S 1 on the order of 2 . 0 × 10 4 s − 1 ( λ M = 0 . 1 eV ) , which is over 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that from T 1 to S 1 ( 4 . 3 × 10 7 s − 1 ) . Therefore , UISC via the T 2 state can be ruled out for this molecule . Our results underline that subtle changes in Δ E ST and SOC matrix element values can have signi ﬁ cant impacts on the UISC rates . We now turn to a discussion of the factors that determine the magnitudes of Δ E ST and SOC . 3 . 2 . Singlet − Triplet Energy Gap , Δ E ST . In the restricted Hartree − Fock picture that has been pervasive in the discussion of TADF emitters , the exchange energy , K , between the hole ( in the HOMO ) and electron ( in the LUMO ) stabilizes the triplet excited state and destabilizes to the same extent the corresponding singlet excited state , 23 , 24 which leads to a Δ E ST of 2 K . 60 As stated earlier , however , the singlet and triplet excited states are often of a di ﬀ erent nature ; as a result , not only the exchange energy K but also the Coulomb integral , J , of the hole − electron pair and the relevant orbital energy di ﬀ erence are different for the singlet and triplet excited states ; 23 , 24 , 61 furthermore , electron correlation e ﬀ ects can also play di ﬀ erent roles in stabilizing the excitation energies of those two states . 24 Therefore , in reality , Δ E ST does not necessarily equate to 2K . It is thus desirable to gain a better understanding of the factors governing Δ E ST . The calculated Δ E ST values for the non - TADF emitters are the largest ( 0 . 88 and 0 . 76 eV for CBP and α - NPD , respectively , see Table 1 ) among the molecules studied here . This is related to the substantial LE nature in both T 1 and S 1 states . As reported in Table 3 and illustrated in Figure S2 , CBP exhibits dominant LE characteristics ( 75 . 8 % ) for the lowest triplet excited state , leading to substantial K and thus signi ﬁ cant Δ E ST . Although the S 1 state exhibits a signi ﬁ cant increase in CT character ( 46 . 9 % ) corresponding to a smaller K , the LE contribution to the S 1 state remains predominant . Likewise , see Figure S2 , despite a more signi ﬁ cant CT nature of the S 1 state ( 72 . 1 % ) , α - NPD possesses a substantial LE character in the T 1 state ( 70 . 5 % ) , indicating a larger overlap between the corresponding transition orbitals and thus a larger K . It is noteworthy that the comparatively smaller Δ E ST value of α - NPD compared to that of CBP can be associated with its enhanced CT character in the S 1 state ( 72 . 1 % vs 53 . 1 % ) . The molecules composed of electron - donor ( D ) and electron - acceptor ( A ) units show , as expected , notably smaller Δ E ST values . Taking the NTOs of 2CzPN and PIC - TRZ molecules as examples , see Figure S2 , a clear CT character ( ∼ 90 % ) from D to A appears in the S 1 state , due to the spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO , leading to a small K and small Δ E ST value . 23 , 24 , 62 For the T 1 state of 2CzPN , however , a signi ﬁ cant LE component appears ( 49 . 4 % ) , while the LE character in the PIC - TRZ T 1 state remains limited ( 14 . 1 % ) . 63 As a result , 2CzPN exhibits a substantially larger Δ E ST ( 0 . 25 eV ) than PIC - TRZ ( 0 . 11 eV ) . Turning to Spiro - CN , PXZ - TRZ , and 4CzPN , a signi ﬁ cant CT character is observed in the T 1 states ( from 70 . 3 % to 96 . 2 % ) in addition to a predominant CT nature for their S 1 states ( 87 . 6 − 97 . 9 % ) . 63 Consequently , Δ E ST is calculated be less than 0 . 1 eV ( 0 . 00 eV for 4CzPN and 0 . 09 eV for PXZ - TRZ and 4CzTPN - Me ) . In the case of ACRFLCN , Δ E ST is small , ca . 20 meV , even though the T 1 state has a strong LE character and S 1 is predominantly CT in nature . The T 2 state of this molecule , however , is characterized as predominantly CT ( 90 . 9 % of CT nature , see Figure 3 and Table 3 ) as in the S 1 state , which suggests a very small K for this triplet excited state and hence a very small energy di ﬀ erence between the S 1 and T 2 states . Given the 20 meV Δ E ST between S 1 and T 1 , the T 1 and T 2 states should be nearly isoenergetic ; as mentioned earlier , the T 1 − T 2 energy di ﬀ erence is calculated to be just ca . 5 meV ( Table 2 ) . Therefore , the small Δ E ST of ACRFLCN should be ascribed to the energetic vicinity of the T 1 and T 2 states . The question then arises as to when the triplet LE and CT states are close in energy ? A useful starting point is to consider Table 3 .

Soc . 2017 , 139 , 4042 − 4051 4046 the HOMO − LUMO energy gap , Δ E H ‑ L . 24 , 43 , 61 In the case of the CT triplet state , it is the Δ E H ‑ L calculated for the whole molecule that is relevant ( with the HOMO localized on the donor subunit and the LUMO on the acceptor subunit : Δ E H ‑ L CT ) . For the LE triplet state , it is the Δ E H ‑ L calculated for the subunit ( donor or acceptor : Δ E H ‑ L LE ) on which the triplet exciton resides that is relevant . As we pointed out earlier , an LE character leads to a large K value and a strong stabilization of the LE triplet state energy . It is when Δ E H ‑ L CT becomes small enough with respect to Δ E H ‑ L LE that the CT triplet state energy can decrease su ﬃ ciently to compensate for its intrinsically smaller K . 24 , 61 Then , the CT triplet state can become energetically close to the LE triplet state , as in CC2TA and ACRFLCN , or even more stable than the triplet LE state , as in Spiro - CN and PXZ - TRZ . These four molecules have similar contributions from excitations within carbazole - type moieties in their LE triplet state ( see Figures 3 and S2 ) ; hence , comparable exchange stabilization energies ( as well as similar Coulombic and electron correlation contributions ) can be expected for the LE triplet state . It is useful to consider the ratio of the calculated Δ E H ‑ L value for the whole molecule ( Δ E H ‑ L CT ) over the Δ E H ‑ L value for the carbazole subunit ( Δ E H ‑ L LE ) : Δ Δ ‐ ‐ E E H L CT H L LE ( 5 ) In going from CC2TA to ACRFLCN and Spiro - CN , this ratio decreases from 0 . 87 to 0 . 80 and 0 . 78 ( see Table S9 ) ; this trend follows the stabilization of the CT triplet energy vs the LE state energy , with Δ E TT going from 36 to 5 meV and − 34 meV ( a negative value meaning here that the CT triplet state is more stable than the LE triplet state ) . In the case of PXZ - TRZ , this ratio is even smaller ( 0 . 71 ) , which is consistent with the even larger energy di ﬀ erence between the CT ( T 1 ) and LE ( T 2 ) states for that molecule ( − 78 meV ) . In the case of 2CzPN and 4CzPN , the LE triplet states are more localized as they are found within a single phthalonitrile unit , which further increases the magnitude of K . 2CzPN and 4CzPN have the Δ E H ‑ L ratios in eq 5 equal to 0 . 76 and 0 . 71 , respectively ; this has the consequence that the T 1 state of the latter has a larger CT contribution ( 70 . 3 % in 4CzPN vs 50 . 6 % in 2CzPN ) . To summarize the discussion thus far , a spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO signi ﬁ cantly enhances the CT contribu - tion to the S 1 state . On the other hand , for the T 1 state , given the increased stabilization of triplet excited states when larger K values are realized as is the case for local excitations , spatially separating the HOMO and LUMO does not necessarily lead to a dominant CT character in the T 1 state , which would be essential to ensure a small Δ E ST . Rather , the T 1 state often possesses a signi ﬁ cant LE character , which can result in a substantial Δ E ST value . However , we have highlighted instances where either the CT T 2 state can become energetically close to the LE T 1 state or the T 1 state gains strong CT character . 3 . 3 . Spin − Orbit Coupling . As shown in eq 1 , the UISC rate is proportional to the square of the SOC matrix element . The calculated SOC matrix element values for the molecules in this study have been listed in Table 1 . These SOC matrix elements remain , as expected , very small in comparison to those in molecules containing a heavy metal atom ; they vary over a range that is approximately 2 − 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the value calculated for Ir ( ppy ) 3 , ca . 114 cm − 1 . 64 However , as we underlined above , it is important to bear in mind that a change in these values over a few tenths of a cm − 1 can signi ﬁ cantly modulate the UISC rate . A further detailed discussion of the H ̂ SO operator can aid in the interpretation of our results . Using the central - ﬁ eld approximation where the potential energy for an electron , V , is a function of r between electron i and nucleus μ , eq 4 further reads as ∑ ∑ ̂ = − ∂ ∂ ̂ · ̂ + ̂ · ̂ + ̂ · ̂ μ μ μ μ μ μ μ μ + − − + ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ H c c V r V r l s l s l s 2 ( 2 ) 1 1 2 ( ) i i i i i i i i i iz iz SO 2 2 2 ( 6 ) where l ̂ ± [ s ̂ ± ] stands for raising ( + ) or lowering ( − ) operator for the orbital [ spin ] angular momentum of a given electron ; l ̂ z [ s ̂ z ] , denotes the z component of the orbital angular momentum operator , l ̂ [ the spin momentum operator , s ̂ ] of the electron . This equation implies that , upon ﬂ ipping the spin angular momentum of an electron up ( s ̂ + ) , the orbital angular momentum of the electron must be lowered ( l ̂ − ) , and vice versa , so as to conserve the total angular momentum . Since organic molecules in this study do not contain heavy atoms with d atomic orbitals , only the angular momentum of electrons Figure 3 .

Journal of the American Chemical Society Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / jacs . 6b12124 J . Am . Chem . Soc . 2017 , 139 , 4042 − 4051 4047 in p atomic orbitals are a ﬀ ected by H ̂ SO . When a given p z ( p 0 ) atomic orbital participating in a π - bond is involved , for example , upon ﬂ ipping the spin up , the l ̂ − operators convert the p 0 orbital of the electron into p − 1 . Since p − 1 is a linear combination of p x and p y orbitals , such an atomic orbital no longer participates in the π - bond ; the opposite situation can also be readily expected . Consequently , when the spin of an electron is ﬂ ipped over , H ̂ SO either suppresses or reinforces π - conjugation , leading to a di ﬀ erent extent of π - conjugation . Therefore , the SOC matrix element value for ISC can be qualitatively estimated by evaluating the changes in π - conjugation of either hole or electron wave functions , between the singlet and triplet excited states . This is in line with the El - Sayed rule , i . e . , the rate of ISC becomes faster when the ISC process involves a change in orbital type . 65 , 66 It should be borne in mind , however , that if the π - conjugation changes in both hole and electron wave functions , such changes correspond to spin - ﬂ ips of both hole and electron ; then , the system remains in the same spin multiplicity and the SOC for ISC is suppressed . 64 , 67 In the case of ACRFLCN , the S 1 state has a predominant CT nature ( 91 . 6 % ) , while the T 1 state is predominantly a LE state ( 95 . 7 % ) , see Figure 3 and Table 3 . This di ﬀ erence in the nature of the excited states gives rise to a signi ﬁ cant SOC matrix element value of 0 . 46 cm − 1 . On the other hand , in Spiro - CN , the S 1 and T 1 states both have a signi ﬁ cant CT character ( 97 . 9 % and 96 . 2 % , respectively , see Table 3 ) , leading to a negligible SOC matrix element value of 0 . 01 cm − 1 ; as detailed above , however , the T 2 state is characterized as a LE state within the donor subunit ( 97 . 6 % ) ; hence , the SOC matrix element value between the S 1 and T 2 states is as large as 0 . 61 cm − 1 . PXZ - TRZ exhibits an even stronger SOC matrix element value ( 1 . 54 cm − 1 ) between the S 1 and T 2 states , 68 which is again understood by their marked di ﬀ erence in nature ( CT vs LE state , respectively , see Figure 3 ) . 14 , 16 , 22 , 29 For PIC - TRZ , despite a distinct di ﬀ erence in nature ( CT vs LE ) , the SOC matrix element values between the S 1 and T 2 states is smaller ( 0 . 28 cm − 1 ) because of π - conjugation changes in both hole and electron wave functions ( Figure S2 ) . In the cases of 4CzPN and 4CzTPN , the calculated SOC matrix element values are relatively high : 0 . 61 and 0 . 81 cm − 1 , respectively . However , those of 4CzIPN and 4CzIPN - Me remain moderate : 0 . 27 and 0 . 17 cm − 1 , respectively . CT contributions in the S 1 state of all 4CzPN analogues are as high as 87 . 6 − 91 . 0 % and those for the T 1 states are also in the range between 70 . 3 % and 82 . 7 % . Therefore , such variations in the SOC matrix element values are puzzling . A closer observation of NTO pairs , however , reveals an important di ﬀ erence among this series of molecules . Since , the SOC matrix elements are calculated at the T 1 - state geometries , it is more appropriate to compare the natures of the S 1 and T 1 states at those geometries , see Figure 4 . We ﬁ rst note that all of these molecules have similar electron wave functions in both S 1 and T 1 states . The di ﬀ erences are to be found in the hole wave functions . In the molecules with higher SOC matrix elements ( 4CzPN and 4CzTPN ) , it appears that different carbazole subunits are involved in the electronic transitions to the S 1 and T 1 states . For instance , in 4CzPN , it is the carbazole units in ortho with respect to the cyano substituents that are mainly involved in the hole wave function of the S 1 state , while the neighboring meta - carbazole units are a major component of the T 1 state ; this points to di ﬀ erent distributions of π - conjugation in the hole wave functions for the T 1 and S 1 states , as we have observed in the cases of LE triplet vs CT singlet states . In the case of 4CzTPN , all four carbazole units make nearly equal contributions to the hole wave function of the S 1 state , while only two of them contribute signi ﬁ cantly to the T 1 state ( a feature again in line with the tendency of triplet wave functions to be more contracted in order to maximize K ) , which points to di ﬀ erent distributions of π - conjugation . Recalling that an e ﬃ cient ISC requires a change in π - conjugation of either hole or electron wave function ( see section 2 ) , such di ﬀ erences in the π - conjugation of the hole wave functions between the S 1 and T 1 states is consistent with the substantial SOC matrix element values for 4CzPN and 4CzTPN . On the other hand , in the 4CzIPN derivatives , the di ﬀ erences in hole wave functions for the S 1 and T 1 states are not as signi ﬁ cant , which leads to relatively smaller SOC matrix element values . These results highlight , as expected from eq 6 , the importance of variations in the π - conjugation of either hole or electron wave functions in the course of the ISC process . 3 . 4 . Design Rules for E ﬃ cient Up - Conversion ISC . In order to increase the UISC rates , the case is clear that Δ E ST should be minimized and spin − orbit coupling should be maximized . Since the S 1 state of a donor − acceptor molecule usually corresponds to the transition from HOMO ( on the donor subunit ) to LUMO ( on the acceptor subunit ) and displays a dominant charge - transfer character , it is the triplet excited state with a local - excitation nature that naturally leads to a strong SOC with the S 1 state . As a result , this LE triplet state should be energetically close to the S 1 state . 22 Given that the S 1 state and its corresponding CT triplet state are necessarily close in energy , this requirement in turn translates into an energetic Figure 4 .

Hydrogen atoms are omitted for the sake clarity . Journal of the American Chemical Society Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / jacs . 6b12124 J . Am . Chem . Soc . 2017 , 139 , 4042 − 4051 4048 proximity between the LE and CT triplet states . As was amply discussed earlier , LE triplet states are generally more stable than their CT counterparts . Given that the energy of the CT state is far more sensitive to Δ E H ‑ L than that of the LE state , 61 it is much easier to reduce Δ E ST by manipulating the former , i . e . , by reducing the Δ E H ‑ L of the donor − acceptor molecule for a given combination of donor and acceptor subunits , one of which determines the LE triplet state energy . Ways to ful ﬁ ll this goal are to stabilize to the same extent the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the acceptor subunits , or to destabilize those of the donor subunits , as illustrated in Figure 5 . In this context , it is useful to recall that carbazole has long been exploited as a typical donor subunit . We have demonstrated earlier that carbazole can inductively pull some electron density from an adjacent acceptor and such an e ﬀ ect is additive when increasing the number of carbazole units ; 25 − 27 , 61 hence , additional carbazole ( s ) further stabilize to a similar extent the HOMO and LUMO of the neighboring acceptor subunit , with little modi ﬁ cation of the ( local ) Δ E H ‑ L value of carbazole subunit itself . Furthermore , when several of the same donor or acceptor units are employed , some of them likely ﬁ nd themselves in chemically di ﬀ erent environments ; combined with a small Δ E ST ( induced by the use of several , for example , carbazole units ) , this can lead to di ﬀ erent natures for the S 1 vs T 1 states , and hence enhanced UISC , even when both the S 1 and T 1 states have a dominant CT character . As discussed earlier , the four carbazole groups in 4CzPN are in two distinctive environments , i . e . , ortho - vs meta - positions with respect to the closest cyano substituent ; the carbazole units at the latter positions are more prone to secure a larger LE character ; hence , the S 1 and T 1 states have di ﬀ erent hole wave functions . Likewise , the carbazole groups of 4CzTPN are in two inequivalent positions , as they connect to the core tereph - thalonitrile unit at either large or small amplitudes of the hole wave functions , see Figure 4 . As a result , only two of the carbazole units are involved in more contracted hole wave functions for the T 1 state because of the larger K stabilization the triplet can then achieve . 4 . SYNOPSIS We have evaluated the up - conversion ( also known as “ reverse ” ) intersystem crossing rates , k UISC , for a series of organic emitters relevant for thermally activated delayed ﬂ uorescence ( TADF ) . The good agreement with available experimental data has allowed us to theoretically explore , on reliable grounds , the factors in ﬂ uencing k UISC , i . e . , the energy di ﬀ erence between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states , Δ E ST , and the strength of spin − orbit coupling , SOC . The UISC rates are faster , the smaller the Δ E ST values and the larger the SOC . In spite of signi ﬁ cantly weaker SOC in comparison to heavy - atom containing phosphors ( by 2 − 3 orders of magnitude ) , we ﬁ nd that UISC in TADF organic materials can occur on a time scale shorter than 100 ns at 300 K . With regard to lessening Δ E ST , we conclude that spatially separating the HOMO and LUMO wave functions in donor − acceptor - type organic emitters is not a su ﬃ cient criterion . Indeed , the lowest triplet excited state tends to have a local - excitation character , as this maximizes the exchange energy and thus minimizes its energy . What is required is to stabilize the lowest triplet state with a charge - transfer character or to enhance the CT contribution to the T 1 state . This can be achieved by decreasing signi ﬁ cantly the HOMO − LUMO energy gap in the donor − acceptor molecule with respect to the HOMO − LUMO gap for the subunit ( donor or acceptor ) on which the triplet exciton tends to localize . The spin − orbit coupling can be strengthened by making di ﬀ erent the natures of the relevant excited singlet and triplet states , which is consistent with the El - Sayed rule . Our results underline that , in up - converting from the lowest triplet to the lowest singlet excited state , a marked change in the π - conjugation pattern of either the hole or electron wave function is critical . To enhance the UISC rate then requires : either to up - convert from a LE triplet to a CT singlet state while succeeding in having these two states very close in energy , as described above ; or to have a signi ﬁ cant CT contribution to the T 1 state while achieving signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erences in the π - conjugation patterns of the hole or electron wave functions . Regarding the latter aspect , it is has been found useful to rely on multiple , identical donor or acceptor subunits . The design rules to which our work points , have been detailed in section 3 . 4 . Finally , we recall that the photoluminescence quantum yield ( PLQY ) also plays a critical role in the TADF process . For instance , the PLQY of 4CzIPN was reported to be 93 . 8 % , while those of 4CzPN and 4CzTPN were measured to be 74 . 4 and 71 . 6 % , respectively . 17 As a result , 4CzIPN has demonstrated to be one of the most e ﬃ cient TADF materials to date , despite the fact that our calculations point to a one - order - of - magnitude smaller k UISC than in 4CzPN . Thus , further systematic studies including the PLQYs of TADF materials are also required ; these would have to evaluate , in the condensed phase , not only the prompt ﬂ uorescence e ﬃ ciency itself but the nonradiative decay rates from the T 1 state to the ground state as well , a challenging theoretical / computational proposition .

Thus , radiationless transitions between a singlet state and a triplet state ( or between a doublet and a quartet state ) correspond to ISC . Since triplet excited states are in general lower in energy than their singlet counterparts , we refer the ISC from the T 1 state to the S 1 state to up - conversion ISC ( UISC ) , and that in the opposite direction to down - conversion ISC ( DISC ) . We note that UISC is also often referred to in the literature as reverse ISC ( RISC ) . ( 16 ) Dias , F . B . ; Santos , J . ; Graves , D . R . ; Data , P . ; Nobuyasu , R . S . ; Fox , M .

( 36 ) We note recent reports ( refs 28 − 30 ) that stressed the role of the vibronic coupling between the T 1 and higher triplet excited states . In such a case , TADF might be observed . In addition , hyper ﬁ ne interactions between nucleus and electron spins can contribute to the ISC ( refs 20 , 21 ) ; however , such an e ﬀ ect is expected to be small for TADF molecules ( ref 29 ) and hence is not considered in this study .

( 55 ) In the absence of experimental SOC values , the tests were conducted based on the vertical singlet excitation energies and vertical singlet − triplet energy di ﬀ erences in comparison to the results obtained with the LC - ω * PBE functional , which is found to be reliable in the calculation of TADF molecules ( ref 42 ) . In addition , the natures of the several lowest lying excited states are the same for both functionals ( see Table S7 ) ; we note , however , that the ordering of the T 1 and T 2 states of ACR - FLCN is di ﬀ erent , which was taken into account in the computation of the SOC and the UISC rate .

( 63 ) In the cases of PIC - TRZ and Spiro - CN , the natures of the T 1 states in this study are di ﬀ erent from those in the literature ( Table 3 ) ; however , the T 2 states of such molecules are very close to their T 1 states in energy ( 9 and 34 meV , respectively ) , which helps explain the ordering changes in these molecules . In the cases of 4CzPN analogues , we note that our results tend to overestimate the CT contributions with respect to the results in the literature ( refs 40 and 61 ) , pointing to the e ﬀ ect of the nature of the chosen DFT functionals .

( 68 ) In the case of PXZ - TRZ , supplementary calculations reveal that the SOC value between the singlet CT and triplet LE states signi ﬁ cantly decreases ( ca . 0 . 06 cm − 1 ) when its N and O atoms are replaced with CH and CH 2 groups , respectively , demonstrating the e ﬀ ect of the presence of such atoms with larger nucleus charges than C . Furthermore , the electron wave functions for the singlet CT and triplet LE states appear to be more con ﬁ ned , making such e ﬀ ect more prominent . As a result , the computed SOC value for this molecule is ca . 1 . 54 cm − 1 , the highest one among the molecules in this study .
