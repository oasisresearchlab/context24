Abstract The Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 ( TORC2 ) plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of plasma membrane ( PM ) tension . TORC2 activation upon increased PM tension involves redistribution of the Slm1 and 2 paralogs from PM invaginations known as eisosomes into membrane compartments containing TORC2 . How Slm1 / 2 relocalization is triggered , and if / how this plays a role in TORC2 inactivation upon decreased PM tension is unknown . Using osmotic shocks and Palmitoylcarnitine ( PalmC ) as orthogonal tools to manipulate PM tension , we demonstrate that decreased PM tension triggers spontaneous , energy - independent reorganization of pre - existing phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) into discrete invaginated membrane domains which cluster and inactivate TORC2 . These results demonstrate that an increase and a decrease in membrane tension are sensed through different mechanisms and highlight a role for membrane lipid phase separation in mechanotransduction .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s The plasma membrane ( PM ) is fundamental for cell survival . Not only does it form a selectively permeable barrier and dynamic interface , but it also serves as a scaffolding platform on which many fate - determining signaling decisions are taken . Furthermore , PM tension , defined as the in - plane counteracting force to surface expansion , plays an important role in transferring and integrating information in cells and within tissues 1 – 3 . Biological membranes are constantly affected by processes - for example endo / exocytosis and cell migration - that impinge on their surface area , composition , and the activity of attachment proteins . This adds complexity but also provides the cell with multiple options for regulation of PM tension . Indeed , all cell types react , albeit with different kinetics , to counteract perturbations in PM tension suggesting that this is a tightly - controlled biophysical parameter 4 – 6 . Despite its established importance , little is known about the mechanisms by which PM tension is sensed and regulated . We recently identified the Target Of Rapamycin Complex 2 ( TORC2 ) as a regulator of cell surface area and PM tension homeostasis 7 . Specifically , we found that manipulations that presumably increase PM tension , including mechanical stretch of the PM , inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis and hypo - osmotic shock , all trigger the redistribution of the Slm proteins away from furrow - like invaginations organized by BAR protein assemblies called eisosomes 8 , 9 , into Membrane Compartments Containing TORC2 ( MCTs ) 10 . The signal that triggers Slm protein relocalization remains mysterious but membrane stretch has been reported to similarly induce mTORC2 signaling in mammalian cells 11 , implying that TORC2 activation by increased PM tension is conserved . Our model does not consider what happens in the case of a decrease in PM tension , although one might assume that Slm1 / 2 would relocalize away from MCTs and back into eisosomes , inactivating TORC2 . Here , we describe a small - molecule modulator of TORC2 signaling , Palmitoylcarnitine ( PalmC ) , which acts primarily by reducing PM tension , monitored in live yeast cells with a mechanosensitive probe . Using PalmC and hyper - osmotic shocks as orthogonal approaches to diminish membrane tension , we found that neither treatment acutely affects Slm1 localization while both induce the phase separation of pre - existing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 into pronounced PM invaginations sequestering TORC2 and leading to its inactivation . Results TORC2 senses hypo - and hyperosmotic stress through independent mechanisms Slm1 and 2 have previously been implicated in TORC2 signaling 12 , 13 and specifically in the perception of an increase in PM tension upstream of TORC2 7 . In exponentially growing cells , ~ 60 % of the Slm proteins localize to punctate PM protein assemblies called eisosomes 8 , 14 with the remainder in MCTs . Upon increased tension , the eisosomal pool relocalizes to MCTs and TORC2 signaling is increased 7 . To further explore the molecular mechanisms regulating TORC2 activity , we applied osmotic shocks to single cells expressing Slm1 - GFP and Lsp1 - mCherry , which marks eisosomes . Changes in the colocalization between the two markers were compared with the evolution of TORC2 activity , assessed by monitoring the phosphorylation status of the direct TORC2 substrate T 662 in Ypk1 15 , 16 . Consistent with our previous work 7 , upon a hypo - osmotic shock , Slm1 - GFP moved out of eisosomes and Riggi et al . Page 2 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 February 27 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s TORC2 was activated with similar kinetics ( Fig . 1a - c ) . However , although TORC2 activity was inhibited under a hyper - osmotic shock , both Slm1 - GFP and Lsp1 - mCherry distributions remained unaffected ( Fig . 1d - f ) . We noted that hypo - osmotic shock transiently stimulated TORC2 activity in an amplitude - dependent manner , but that TORC2 activity went back to steady - state levels after only 5min , regardless of the amplitude of the shock that was applied to the cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1a and S1c , left panel ) . Hyper - osmotic shock also caused a transient and amplitude - dependent inhibition of TORC2 activity , but in this case , the return of TORC2 activity to its basal level was slower and amplitude - dependent ( Supplementary Fig . S1b and S1c , right panel ) . Together , these results demonstrate that hypo - and hyper - osmotic shocks are sensed upstream of TORC2 by distinct molecular mechanisms . The HOG pathway 17 , 18 and the CWI pathway 19 constitute obvious candidates to couple osmotic stress to TORC2 . However , cells deficient in single or multiple components in these pathways including : HOG pathway mutants sln1Δ pbs2Δ , hkr1Δ msb2Δ and sln1Δ pbs2Δ hkr1Δ msb2Δ ; a CWI pathway mutant wsc1Δ mid2Δ ; and , a combined mutant wsc1Δ mid2Δ hkr1Δ msb2Δ ( we were unable to recover a wsc1Δ mid2Δ sln1Δ pbs2Δ quadruple mutant from our dissections ) - all retained the ability to regulate TORC2 activity upon osmotic shocks similarly to WT cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1d ) . Thus , the osmo - sensor ( s ) upstream of TORC2 must be independent of these factors . TORC2 signaling affects PM tension We entertained the idea that PM tension per se might be what is sensed upstream of TORC2 . Hypo - and hyper - osmotic shocks are assumed to increase and decrease PM tension by increasing and decreasing turgor pressure respectively . To verify that osmotic shocks can be used to manipulate PM tension in yeast , we used the recently - developed mechanosensitive “FliptR” ( Fluorescent LIPid Tension Reporter ) probe 20 ( Supplementary Fig . S2a ) . This twisted push - pull fluorophore stably integrates into the PM of cells where its planarization and polarization , and thus its fluorescence properties , are sensitive to mechanical forces acting on the membrane ( Supplementary Fig . S2b ) . Specifically , its fluorescence lifetime , which can be determined by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy ( FLIM ) , changes linearly with PM tension in model membranes and in mammalian cells ( unpublished data ) , making it a valuable tool to monitor PM tension changes in situ . Consistently , hypo - and hyper - osmotic shocks to yeast cells respectively triggered an increase and a decrease in the FliptR lifetime , proportional to the intensity of the shock ( Fig . 2a ) . This confirms that such shocks can be used to manipulate PM tension in yeast and that the FliptR probe can be used to qualitatively report on changes in PM tension . We had previously proposed that TORC2 is part of a homeostatic feedback loop that maintains PM tension 7 . The FliptR probe now allows us to test this model directly . We chose to inhibit TORC2 using a recently described chemical - genetic approach 21 wherein TORC2 , but not TORC1 , is specifically inhibited by rapamycin - FKBP12 . Rapamycin - treatment of these cells caused a progressive increase in the lifetime of the fluorophore ( Fig . 2b ) , indicating an increase in PM tension . Conversely , enhanced TORC2 signaling in a strain expressing a hyperactive YPK2 allele 16 lowered PM tension , evidenced by a reduced Riggi et al . Page 3 Nat Cell Biol .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s lifetime of the fluorophore ( Fig . 2c ) . Together , these data add strong support to the model that TORC2 works in a functional feedback loop to maintain PM tensile homeostasis . Palmitoylcarnitine ( PalmC ) , a small - molecule tool to inhibit TORC2 and manipulate PM tension In parallel to these studies , we had launched a high - throughput screening campaign to identify small molecules that specifically interfere with TOR signaling in WT yeast cells ( described in methods , Supplementary Fig . S3a - b , Supplementary Tables 4 - 5 ) . This effort revealed that Palmitoylcarnitine ( PalmC , Supplementary Fig . S3c ) is an inhibitor of TORC2 , but not TORC1 , signaling . Specifically , our screen revealed that the toxicity of PalmC is reduced in cells expressing hyperactive YPK2 ( Supplementary Fig . S3d ) . As this allele suppresses the lethality of TORC2 mutants , this result suggested that PalmC is toxic specifically because it interferes with TORC2 signaling . Consistently , treatment of cells with PalmC induced a fast , transient and dose - dependent inhibition of TORC2 activity , but not TORC1 activity , assessed by monitoring the TORC1 - specific hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Sch9 22 ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Inclusion of PalmC in in vitro kinase assays had no effect on TORC2 kinase activity ( Fig . 3c ) suggesting that it targets a factor upstream of TORC2 . Sensors of the HOG and CWI pathways were again dispensable for the response of TORC2 to PalmC ( Supplementary Fig . S3e ) , and Hog1 was not activated by PalmC treatment ( Supplementary Fig . S3f ) , suggesting that these pathways are not implicated in PalmC mode of action . Based on the amphiphilic properties of PalmC we hypothesized that its effects could be due to modification of the biophysical properties of the PM , particularly tension . Consistent with this idea , we observed a fast and dramatic decrease in the lifetime of the FliptR probe after PalmC treatment ( Fig . 3d ) , demonstrating that the drug induces a decrease in PM tension . If this is the cause of TORC2 inhibition , we would expect that hypo - osmotic shock would suppress this inhibition . To test this prediction , we used fps1Δ cells that cannot efficiently export the osmo - protectant glycerol and thus are slow to recover from hypo - osmotic shock 23 . Simultaneous application of a hypo - osmotic shock to these cells largely negated PalmC - induced TORC2 inactivation ( Fig . 3e ) , while hyper - osmotic shock displayed an additive effect with PalmC on TORC2 inhibition ( Supplementary Fig . S3g ) . We hypothesize that PalmC decreases PM tension by directly intercalating into the PM . Consistently , injecting PalmC into the buffer bathing Giant Unilamellar Vesicles ( GUVs ) resulted in a rapid increase in surface area of the GUV , evidenced by a fast elongation of the aspiration tongue into the micropipette holding the GUV ( Fig . 3f ) . Blockage of exocytosis in sec18 ts cells 24 , or endocytosis in Latrunculin A - treated cells , did not affect PalmC - induced decrease in Ypk1 T 662 phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . S3h , i ) , suggesting that PalmC does not impinge on TORC2 signaling through either of these processes . Based on these results , we decided to use PalmC as a tool , orthogonal to hyper - osmotic shock , to investigate the molecular mechanisms of TORC2 activity regulation upon decreases in PM tension .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s A decrease in PM tension leads to the clustering of TORC2 to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - Enriched PM Domains We first investigated the effect of a PalmC - induced decrease in PM tension on TORC2 localization . As previously observed 10 , TORC2 , visualized through a GFP tag fused to its Avo3 subunit , localized to many small foci distributed along the PM . Following PalmC - treatment these foci clustered into fewer , brighter puncta ( Fig . 4a ) . We measured and plotted the size distributions of these fluorescence maxima for untreated and PalmC - treated cells and found that they had very little overlap . This allowed us to define a fluorescent intensity threshold that separates small foci from larger puncta ( Supplementary Fig . S4a ) . Puncta become noticeable after a few minutes of treatment , crested in number after 30min , when they were present in 84 % of the cells , and persisted for up to 90min . The size , as well as the kinetics of the assembly and disassembly of these structures was dose - dependent . Notably , this timing correlated with both the kinetics of inhibition and reactivation of TORC2 activity and with a decrease and increase in PM tension as readout by the FliptR probe ( Fig . 4b ) . Thus , TORC2 clustering into puncta is correlated with its inactivation . Decreasing PM tension with a hyper - osmotic shock mimicked the PalmC effect and triggered TORC2 puncta formation , however direct inhibition of TORC2 activity by the ATP - competitive small molecule NVP - BHS34525 did not ( Supplementary Fig . S4b ) . Together , these results suggest that clustering into puncta is potentially the cause of TORC2 inactivation in response to a decrease in PM tension , and not a consequence of its inactivation . As with hyper - osmotic shock , the cellular distribution of Slm1 - mCherry remained largely unaffected during the first 20 min after PalmC treatment , but these proteins then also began to cluster ( Fig . 4c ) . We used the same threshold method to quantify Slm1 puncta ( Supplementary Fig . S4c ) and observed that they crested after 60min of treatment . Interestingly , the kinetics of Slm1 puncta formation tracks with the kinetics of TORC2 reactivation ( Fig . 4b ) . Inhibition of TORC2 results in an increase in PM tension ( Fig . 2b ) , and we assume that once cells have restored a sufficient amount of tension in the PM , the Slm proteins re - associate with TORC2 leading to its reactivation and the dissociation of the TORC2 puncta . Consistent with this model , anchoring of Slm1 to eisosomes during PalmC recovery prevented TORC2 reactivation ( Supplementary Fig . S4d , e ) . TORC2 is recruited to the PM via the PH domain of its Avo1 subunit which binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 10 . Also , tor2 mutants interact genetically with MSS4 26 which encodes the sole PtdIns ( 4 ) P - 5 - kinase in yeast . Thus , we speculated that decreased PM tension might affect the cellular distribution of this lipid , in turn affecting TORC2 activity . To investigate this , we examined the cellular distribution of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 using the biosensor GFP - 2xPH PLC δ 27 . In basal conditions , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was distributed uniformly along the PM , in accordance with previous studies 28 . Upon PalmC treatment or hyperosmotic shock , we observed a fast and striking redistribution of GFP - 2xPH PLC δ at the PM , whereas direct inhibition of TORC2 did not trigger this lipid rearrangement ( Fig . 4d ) . Staining cells expressing the GFP - 2xPH PLC δ biosensor with FM4 - 64 showed that the clusters appearing upon decreased PM tension are truly enriched in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , as evidenced by the ratiometric comparison of the images acquired in the two channels ( Fig . 4e ) .

PM buckling into large invaginations has been observed when cells possess an excess of PM , for example , after hyper - osmotic shock 29 . Interestingly , PalmC - treated , but not control cells , presented large folded PM invaginations , enriched in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , when observed by electron microscopy after anti - GFP immunogold labelling in cells expressing the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor ( Supplementary Fig . S4f ) . Similar structures were previously observed in cells deleted for the genes encoding inositol - 5 - phosphatases , and thus contain elevated levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 30 . These structures are reminiscent of failed endocytic events 31 ; however , endocytosis requires an intact actin cytoskeleton in yeast 31 , and pretreatment with Latrunculin A ( LatA ) , an actin depolymerizing agent , did not prevent PES formation ( Supplementary Fig . S3g ) . Additionally , LatA treatment did not affect PES dissolution , implying that endocytosis is not essential to resolve these structures ( Supplementary Fig . S4h ) . As TORC2 clusters and PES appear after PalmC treatment with similar kinetics we asked whether or not these structures are related ; indeed , we found that Avo3 - GFP and mCherry - 2xPH PLC δ puncta colocalized ( Fig . 4g , 60 . 3 + / - 14 . 6 % colocalization ) . Together , these results suggest that the relocalization and clustering of TORC2 into PES is part of a common mechanism to transiently inhibit TORC2 activity upon a decrease of PM tension . At later time points , Slm1 - mCherry puncta also colocalized with PES ( Fig . 4h , 65 . 4 + / - 10 . 4 % colocalization ) , likely to reactivate TORC2 as described above . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is crucial for TORC2 clustering and inhibition upon a decrease in PM tension We postulated that the interaction between the PH domain of Avo1 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 constitutes the driving mechanism responsible for TORC2 clustering . Both localization and activity of TORC2 are lost upon the shift of thermosensitive mss4 - 103 cells to non - permissive temperature ( Supplementary Fig . S5a - b ) . To prevent the detachment of TORC2 from the PM upon loss of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 we replaced the PH domain of Avo1 with a CAAX motif , to enable the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - independent , yet fully functional , PM recruitment of TORC2 10 . The localization of TORC2 CAAX in mss4 - 103 cells was assessed at the permissive ( 30°C ) and the non - permissive ( 37°C ) temperatures , before and after PalmC treatment . At the permissive temperature , TORC2 CAAX behaved similarly to TORC2 WT – it localized to small foci before PalmC treatment and to large puncta after treatment , but it failed to cluster at the non - permissive temperature ( Fig . 5a ) . Growth at 37°C per se did not alter the PalmC - induced relocalization of TORC2 . These observations demonstrate that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is necessary for TORC2 clustering upon PalmC treatment in a manner that does not solely involve the PH domain of Avo1 . We next queried whether the remodeling of the PM itself upon PalmC treatment was also PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent . The absence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in mss4 - 103 TORC2 CAAX cells grown at 37°C precluded the use of the GFP - 2×PH PLC δ biosensor so , for these experiments , changes in the PM structure were visualized using FM4 - 64 . At the permissive temperature , in both WT and mss4 - 103 TORC2 CAAX cells , FM4 - 64 puncta appeared upon PalmC Riggi et al . Page 6 Nat Cell Biol .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s treatment and colocalized with PES ( Fig . 5b ) . FM4 - 64 clusters were not observed in mss4 - 103 TORC2 CAAX cells upon PalmC treatment at the restrictive temperature ( Fig . 5b ) , demonstrating that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for the remodeling of the PM that follows a decrease in PM tension . Furthermore , although the basal activity of the TORC2 CAAX variant is relatively low in mss4 - 103 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S5c ) , this remaining activity is largely resistant to PalmC treatment when cells are incubated at the non - permissive temperature ( Fig . 5c ) . This indicates that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated TORC2 clustering is necessary for TORC2 inhibition . Yeast cells growing in the wild must respond to stresses that affect plasma membrane tension such as osmotic shock and we wondered if TORC2 inactivation contributes to the ability of cells to tolerate such stresses . To test this , we queried if depletion of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 would affect the ability of cells to survive and / or recover from stresses that trigger acute loss of PM tension . Indeed , inactivation of mss4 - 103 , but not the temperature shift per se , impaired regrowth following transient PalmC exposure or hyper - osmotic shock ( Fig . 5d and Supplementary Fig . S5d ) . These observations indicate that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a crucial intermediate in the sensing of decreased PM tension upstream of TORC2 , and that inhibition of TORC2 signaling is an essential response of cells experiencing a sudden decrease in PM tension . A decrease in PM tension triggers PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phase separation Quantification of GFP - 2xPH PLC δ signal after PalmC treatment shows PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering into distinct puncta , but no global increase in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Supplementary Fig . S6a and b ) . Mss4 co - localizes to PalmC - induced PES , cresting at 15 min and disappearing by 90 min ( Fig . 6a ) , suggesting that decreased PM tension might act through Mss4 to create PES . To challenge this hypothesis , we tested whether PES would still form in ATP - depleted cells , in which PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis cannot occur . Upon ATP - depletion , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is rapidly turned over through the action of several phosphatases ( Inp51 , 52 and 53 ) and the GFP - 2xPH PLC δ biosensor disassociates from the PM within a minute ( Fig . 6b , top panel ) . Deletion of INP51 and INP52 prevents this loss of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Remarkably , even after ATP depletion , PalmC treatment still rapidly induces the formation of PES in inp51Δ inp52Δ cells ( Fig . 6b , bottom panel ) . These results demonstrate that decreased PM tension triggers PES formation via a redistribution of pre - existing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and not via de novo synthesis . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 present within PES is not selectively shielded from phosphatases since the GFP - 2XPH PLC δ probe is also rapidly relocalized from PES to the cytosol upon ATP depletion in WT , but not inp51Δ inp52Δ cells ( Supplementary Fig . S6c ) . From these results we conclude that Mss4 relocalization ensures that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels remain high in PES while PM tension is low and that ATP depletion per se does not trigger PES disassembly . Finally , we wondered whether the formation of PES could be due to a lipid phase separation within the PM . To assess this , we used the lipophilic dye Laurdan and subsequent calculation of the Generalized Polarization ( GP ) as a readout for lipid order 32 , 33 . Laurdan partitions equally into liquid - disordered ( Ld ) or liquid - ordered ( Lo ) membranes and is not associated to specific lipids , so GP values reflect the overall organization of the PM34 , being Riggi et al .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s high in Lo phases , and low in Ld phases . The pixel histogram obtained from the GP images of untreated PM followed a normal distribution , meaning that the PM globally displays a homogeneous organization ( Fig . 6c ) . After PalmC treatment , we observed the appearance of a second population of pixels displaying higher GP ( Fig . 6c ) , indicating the presence of a more ordered phase . Using cells expressing the mCherry variant of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor , we confirmed that the domains of high GP correspond to PES ( Fig . 6d ) . Moreover , we observed the appearance of high - GP puncta upon PalmC treatment in ATP - depleted inp51Δinp52Δ , but not WT , cells ( Fig . 6e ) . This confirms the necessity of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the phase separation process . Endocytic BAR domain proteins such as Rvs161 or its dimerization partner Rvs167 , could conceivably drive lipid phase separation . However , this seems unlikely as Rvs167 - GFP does not redistribute to PES upon decreased PM tension ( Supplementary Fig . S6d ) . Collectively , our results support the model that PES formation is the result of a spontaneous phase separation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Discussion We propose that the respective inactivation and activation of TORC2 upon decrease and increase in membrane tension are regulated through fundamentally different mechanisms ( Fig . 6f ) . Sensing of increased PM tension involves the translocation of Slm proteins from eisosomes to MCTs where they activate TORC2 7 . Here , we demonstrated that decreased PM tension triggers a spontaneous , energy - independent PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phase separation into discrete invaginated membrane domains which cluster and inactivate TORC2 . Recently , we reported that clustering of TORC1 upon glucose starvation is both necessary and sufficient for its inactivation 35 . Cryo - electron microscopy revealed that TORC1 clusters are actually a giant helix of regularly assembled TORC1 dimers , organized such that the kinase active site is physically occluded and thus not accessible to substrate . Given the structural similarities between TORC1 and TORC2 36 , we anticipate that the TORC2 clusters that we report here will represent an analogous , higher - order TORC2 assembly responsible for its inactivation . This result presents the interesting possibility that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phase separation is the primary molecular sensor of decreased PM tension . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 patches are well suited to pattern the localized events required for the regulation of a given signaling pathway , by recruiting and activating a range of effector proteins . For example , PES - like structures have also been observed in higher eukaryotes , where they function to organize CD44 - Ezrin interactions linking the PM to the cytoskeletal actin network 37 , and to promote exocytosis by concentrating SNARE proteins 38 , 39 . Interestingly , local PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 production upon growth factor deprivation was very recently implicated in the inhibition of mTORC1 residing on lysosomes and late endosomes 40 . Collectively , these observations suggest that protein sorting by lipid phase - separation could constitute a currently underappreciated mechanism of signal transduction regulation in general and regulation of TOR signaling in particular .

The Laurdan dye ( 6 - Dodecanoyl - 2 - dimethylaminonaphthalene ) was maintained as a 2 . 5mM stock solution in DMF and used at 2 . 5μM . The FM™4 - 64 dye ( ( N - ( 3 - Triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( 6 - ( 4 - ( Diethylamino ) Phenyl ) Hexatrienyl ) Pyridinium Dibromide , Thermofisher ) was dissolved at 10mM in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 10μM . For ATP depletion , cells were treated for 10min with a combination of 3mM NaN 3 and 50mM 2 - deoxy - D - glucose 41 . High - throughput drug screen Both TORC1 and TORC2 perform essential functions which can be genetically bypassed upon introduction of mutations that constitutively activate downstream effector pathways 42 . Specifically , the lethality caused by loss of TORC1 activity can be suppressed by simultaneous expression of a constitutively active variant of the Sch9 kinase and deletion of TIP41 which encodes a protein phosphatase regulator 43 ; lethality associated with the loss of TORC2 activity is suppressed by expression of a hyperactive variant of the Ypk2 kinase 16 . To identify small molecules that potentially interfere with TORC1 and / or TORC2 signaling we screened 89 , 850 molecules from the Rockefeller HTSRC compound library 44 Riggi et al .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s and sought out compounds that are more toxic to WT than to bypass cells ( Supplementary Fig . S3a - b , Supplementary Table 4 ) . A total of 89 , 850 unique compounds from The Rockefeller University High Throughput and Spectroscopy Resource Center library were screened . They were part of the following commercially available libraries : ChemDiv ( San Diego , CA ) , Cerep ( Poitiers , France ) , ChemBridge ( San Diego , CA ) , AMRI ( Albany , NY ) , Greenpharma ( Orléans , France ) , BioFocus ( Charles River , Wilmington , MA ) , Prestwick Chemical ( San Diego , CA ) and LOPAC ( Sigma , Carlsbad , CA ) . Compounds stocks were stored in a total of 281 384 - well polypropylene plates at a final concentration of 5mM in DMSO at - 30°C . 10μL of Agar Yeast Extract - Peptone - Dextrose ( YPD ) broth was preloaded into each well of clear - bottomed 384 - well assay plates using a Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser ( Thermo Scientific ) . Compounds stock plates were thawed at room temperature , and 0 . 1μL of compound was added to the wells of the assay plates using a Perkin Elmer Janus equipped with a Perkin Elmer Nanohead . The overnight , saturated cultures of WT ( TB50 MATa leu2 - 3 , 112 ura3 - 52 rme1 trp1 his3 ) and of the TORC1 / 2 bypass strain ( MS119 ; TB50a pRS304 : : SCH9 DE tip41Δ : : HphMX pRS303 : : YPK2 D239A ) were diluted to OD 600 = 0 . 125 in YPD . 40μL of both diluted cultures were dispensed into the wells of parallel assay plates to achieve a final concentration of compounds of 10μM and a final concentration of DMSO of 0 . 2 % . Plates were subsequently incubated at 30°C in a humidified bag for 24h without agitation . 2 μg / mL of Cycloheximide , which inhibits the growth of both strains , was kept in 8 wells in column 24 and used as a positive control . 0 . 2 % DMSO was kept in the column 23 and used as a negative control . Rapamycin , which inhibits the growth of the WT but not the double bypass ( BY ) strain , was used at a final concentration of 1μg / mL as an internal control for selectivity in the 8 remaining wells of column 24 . The absorbance at 600nm was measured for both strains using a plate reader ( Perkin Elmer Envision ) before ( T 0 ) and after 24h incubation ( T 24 ) . The normalized percentage inhibition of yeast growth ( NPI ) was calculated for each sample as follows : NPI = x− μ− / μ + − μ− x 100 where x is the sample ( OD 600 T 24 – OD 600 T 0 ) , μ - is the negative control mean and μ + is the positive control mean . 55 compounds ( listed in Supplementary Table 5 ) with NPI WT – NPI BY > 20 % or NPI WT – NPI BY < - 50 % were selected for retesting in concentration response experiments to determine half maximal inhibitory concentrations ( IC 50 ) . These compounds were serially diluted by half for a total of 10 dilutions to achieve an assay concentration ranging from 30μM to 0 . 06μM . PalmC , which initially displayed toxicity specifically to the bypass strain , was amongst these 55 compounds ( highlighted in yellow in Supplementary Table 5 ) . Riggi et al .

TCA Protein Extraction & Phosphoproteins Immunodetection 6 % TCA was directly added to exponentially growing yeast cultures and cells were incubated for 5 min on ice before collection . Extracts were prepared as described previously 43 and proteins were resolved on a 7 . 5 % SDS gel and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane . Immunodetection was performed using the indicated antibodies and the Odyssey® IR imaging system ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . In vitro kinase assay GST - Ypk1 K376A and TORC2 were purified from yeast as previously described 21 . TORC2 was pre - incubated with the appropriate concentrations of 1μL of drug / vehicle for 10min at 25°C in a thermomixer rotating at 800rpm . The kinase reactions were started by the addition of 5μg of Ypk1 K376A , 300μM ATP , 4 . 2mM MgCl 2 and 100μCi gamma - 32 P ATP . They were incubated for 10min at 30°C in a thermomixer rotating at 800rpm , and terminated with the addition of 6x SDS - PAGE sample buffer and a 10min incubation at 65°C . Samples were separated by SDS - PAGE on 10 % gels , stained with Sypro Ruby Protein gel stain and analyzed using a BioRad Molecular Imager . Fluorescence Microscopy Cells were grown at 30°C in SC medium to OD 600 = 0 . 6 , mounted on coverslips coated with Concanavalin A ( Sigma ) and immediately imaged with a spinning - disc microscope assembled by 3i ( Intelligent Imaging Innovation , Denver , USA ) and Nikon ( Eclipse C1 , Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) using a 100 x objective ( NA = 1 . 3 , Nikon ) . Laurdan dye integrated into cell membranes was excited along the 405 nm laser line and emission read at 430 ~ 470 nm ( representing the liquid ordered phase ) or 490 ~ 550 nm ( representing the liquid disordered phase ) . For microfluidics experiments , a Concanavalin A - coated coverslip was bonded to the bottom surface of a flow chamber ( sticky - slide VI 0 . 4 , Ibidi , Munich , Germany ) with one entry connected to a syringe pump ( Aladdin , World Precision Instrument , Sarasota , USA ) and the other left open for sequential introduction of different solutions . The flow chamber was primed with SC medium prior to the loading of cells . Loaded cells were washed several Riggi et al . Page 11 Nat Cell Biol .

Images were taken as either single focal planes or captured as Z - series to generate 2D maximum intensity projections . For FLIM ( Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy ) , cells were grown overnight in SC medium to OD 600 = 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 , concentrated by spinning and incubated for 1min with 2ng / mL of the FLipTR probe before imaging using the SymPhoTime 64 software . Electron Microscopy Fixed cells ( 2 , 5 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer 0 . 1M for 2h ) were further treated with 2 % osmium tetroxide and immersed in a solution of uranyl acetate 0 . 25 % overnight . The pellets were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol followed by pure propylene oxide , then embedded in Epon resin . Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed in a Tecnai 20 EM . Image processing and quantification For quantification of the colocalization of fluorescent markers , ( Fig . 1a , 1d , 4g , 4h ) , z - stacks of cells were recorded and deconvoluted . The same threshold was used for each channel in all tested conditions to create binary images . Binary masks were overlaid to an RGB image and yellow ( colocalizing marker ; > / = 4 pixels ) and green ( non - colocalizing ; > / = 4 pixels ) foci were counted using the ImageJ plug - in Cell Counter ( National Institutes of Health , http : / / www . macbiophotonics . ca / imagej / ) . The percentage of foci containing colocalizing markers was calculated with Excel ( Microsoft ) . Ratiometric images ( Fig . 4e ) were constructed using the image calculator tool from ImageJ . Quantification of protein foci intensities ( Fig . S4a and S4c ) was performed using ImageJ . For FLIM analysis ( Fig . 2 , 3d , 4b ) , we used the SymPhoTime 64 software to fit the data according to a 2 - exponential reconvolution model and calculate the lifetime of the FlipTR probe . To study the evolution of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration ( Fig . S6a ) , single focal plane images of the cell middle were taken , a 2px - wide line was drawn around the cortex of cells using ImageJ , and fluorescence intensity values were plotted for each channel . For quantification of cellular total GFP - 2xPH PLC δ fluorescence intensity ( Fig . S6b ) , 0 . 5μm - spaced Z - planes series of cells were taken under identical laser power and exposure time . The cytoplasmic mean fluorescence intensity was subtracted from the total cellular fluorescence intensity ( both measured using ImageJ ) for each focal plane before adding the obtained values . Generalized Polarization ( GP ) values ( Fig . 6c ) were calculated for each pixel of a yeast PM according to the following equation : GP = I440 −I490 / I440 + I490 where I 440 and I 490 represents the intensity of pixels in the areas of interest in the image acquired in the ordered and disordered spectral channels , respectively .
