L E T T E R S Avoiding artefacts when counting polymerized actin in live cells with LifeAct fused to ﬂuorescent proteins Naomi Courtemanche 1 , 4 , 5 , Thomas D . Pollard 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 and Qian Chen 1 , 4 , 5 When tagged with a ﬂuorescent protein , actin is not fully functional 1 , so the LifeAct peptide fused to a ﬂuorescent protein is widely used to localize actin ﬁlaments in live cells 2 . However , we ﬁnd that these fusion proteins have many concentration - dependent effects on actin assembly in vitro and in ﬁssion yeast cells . mEGFP – LifeAct inhibits actin assembly during endocytosis as well as assembly and constriction of the cytokinetic contractile ring . Puriﬁed mEGFP – LifeAct and LifeAct – mCherry bind actin ﬁlaments with K d values of ∼ 10 µ M . LifeAct – mCherry can promote actin ﬁlament nucleation and either promote or inhibit ﬁlament elongation . Both separately and together , proﬁlin and formins suppress these effects . LifeAct – mCherry can also promote or inhibit actin ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin . These concentration - dependent effects mean that caution is necessary when overexpressing LifeAct fusion proteins to label actin ﬁlaments in cells . Therefore , we used low micromolar concentrations of tagged LifeAct to follow assembly and disassembly of actin ﬁlaments in cells . Careful titrations also gave an estimate of a peak of ∼ 190 , 000 actin molecules ( ∼ 500 µ m ) in the ﬁssion yeast contractile ring . These ﬁlaments shorten from ∼ 500 to ∼ 100 subunits as the ring constricts . Quantitative studies of actin assembly are essential to understand the mechanisms of endocytosis , cell motility and cytokinesis . Purified actin labelled with fluorescent dyes was used in assays of bulk samples 3 and individual actin filaments 4 that defined the parameters of actin assembly . Many studies have used actin tagged with a fluorescent protein , butthesefusionproteinscannotreplacethenativeactingene 1 . When expressed at low levels , GFP – actin incorporates into cellular structures nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 1 , 5 . However , no GFP – actin incorporates into contractile rings in either fission yeast 5 , 6 or many other cells 7 , 8 ( with a few exceptions 9 , 10 ) . Even tagging actin with a tetracysteine peptide and FlAsH prevents assembly into contractile rings of fission yeast 6 , because the Cdc12p formin that polymerizes contractile ring actin filaments 11 filters out tagged actin 6 , 12 . An alternative approach is to express fluorescently tagged proteins that bind actin filaments such as calponin homology domains 13 . It was shown 2 that a peptide consisting of the first 17 residues of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Abp140 fused to a fluorescent protein labels actin filaments in cells . Advantages of this ‘LifeAct’ peptide include its small size and the lack of homologous genes in organisms other than S . cerevisiae . LifeAct with fluorescein on its amino terminus binds actin monomers with a K d of 70nM and actin filaments with a K d of 2 . 2 µ M , without aﬀecting the time course of spontaneous polymerization of bulk samples of pyrenyl - actin 2 . However , more than 1 , 800 studies have used LifeAct fused to a fluorescent protein for expression in cells at unspecified concentrations , and no studies have documented the eﬀects of LifeAct fusion proteins on interactions with actin or actin filament turnover in cells . We used fission yeast to test the eﬀects of mEGFP – LifeAct on actin assembly during clathrin - mediated endocytosis 14 , 15 and cytokinesis 16 , both precisely timed events in fission yeast . We expressed a wide range of total mEGFP – LifeAct from the strong repressible P3nmt1 promoter ( Fig . 1a , b ) . These populations of cells grew normally ( Fig . 1c ) . As observed previously 17 , 18 , mEGFP – LifeAct concentrated in endocytic actin patches , cytokinetic contractile rings and actin cables ( Fig . 1a ) . The total cellular mEGFP – LifeAct influenced the fluorescence intensities of these structures but not their distributions , sizes or shapes , judging from fixed cells stained by Alexa 568 – phalloidin ( Fig . 1d ) , consistent with a previous study 17 . However , mEGFP – LifeAct produced concentration - dependent changesinbothendocytosisandcytokinesis . Thetimetoassembleand disassemble ( Fig . 1f , g ) actin patches and to assemble ( Fig . 2a , b ) and constrict ( Fig . 2c , d ) contractile rings increased with the concentration of mEGFP – LifeAct . © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Inset : best ﬁt with constraining the K d at 9 . 3 µ M . All error bars represent the mean ± 1 s . d . Scale bars , 5 µ m . We used purified proteins to investigate possible mechanisms for these eﬀects on cells . Purified mEGFP – LifeAct and LifeAct – mCherry both bound filamentous actin with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry and K d values of 9 . 3 ± 1 . 0 µ M ( Fig . 3a ) and 13 . 2 ± 0 . 7 µ M ( Fig . 3b ) , ∼ 5 - fold weaker than fluorescein – LifeAct ( K d = 2 µ M ) 2 . Thus , neither the position nor the identity of the fluorescent protein influenced the aﬃnity . LifeAct – mCherry slightly increased the anisotropy of Alexa 488 – actin monomers , but unlabelled actin did not aﬀect the anisotropy of LifeAct – mCherry . Thus , LifeAct – mCherry interacts very weakly ( if at all ) with actin monomers . Consistent with previous work with fluorescein – LifeAct 2 , micromolar concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry had no eﬀect on the assembly kinetics of bulk samples of pyrenyl - actin , but decreased the critical concentration for polymerization slightly ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – d ) . Bulk assays measure an ensemble of reactions , including nucleation , elongation , fragmentation and annealing . Observations of single actin filaments by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Fig . 3d ) revealed that LifeAct – mCherry perturbs many aspects of actin assembly . In spite of low aﬃnities for actin filaments and monomers , submicromolar concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry increased the barbed end elongation rate approximately threefold , whereas higher concentrations slowed elongation ( Fig . 3e ) .

The black dots are the average times in bins of 21 . 7 µ M mEGFP – LifeAct . The red line is the best linear ﬁt ( R 2 = 0 . 93 ) to the binned data points . LifeAct – mCherry also increased pointed end elongation from 0 . 09 ± 0 . 03 to 0 . 4 ± 0 . 1subunitss − 1 . As the addition of actin subunits is diﬀusion limited 19 , LifeAct – mCherry is unlikely to increase the rate of subunit addition . One possibility is that LifeAct – mCherry promotes elongation by stimulating nucleation , creating short oligomers that grow and anneal to both ends of filaments , very favourable reactions 20 . We used four approaches to test this hypothesis . First , fluorescence microscopy showed that submicromolar concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry markedly increased the number of filaments formed in reactions containing actin with or without 200nM formin Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 3h , i ) . The number of filaments peaked at 1 µ M LifeAct – mCherry and decreased at higher concentrations . Second , wetestedprofilin , whichinhibitsnucleationbutnotbarbed end elongation 21 . Profilin suppressed the eﬀects of LifeAct – mCherry on elongation of barbed ends ( Fig . 3f ) and nucleation ( Fig . 3i ) . Third , we tested formin FH2 domains , which nucleate actin filaments and remain processively attached to filament barbed ends during elongation 22 , 23 . The Bni1p FH1FH2 construct allows elongation at half the normal rate without profilin . Despite increasing the number of filaments formed ( Fig . 3h , i ) , submicromolar concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry had no eﬀect on the rate of elongation of barbed ends associated with this FH1FH2 construct ( Fig . 3g ) . High concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry slowed the elongation of Bni1p - bound barbed ends up to 30 % , but much less than actin alone . Fourth , we tested the fission yeast cytokinesis formin Cdc12p , which requires profilin to elongate barbed ends 24 . Barbed ends elongating with Cdc12p and profilin were insensitive to LifeAct – mCherry ( Fig . 3g ) . Thus , independently and together profilin and formins minimize the eﬀects of LifeAct – mCherry on actin filament elongation . Profilin prevents formation of the small oligomers required to make nuclei . Formin FH1FH2 constructs prevent annealing at the barbed end 25 , so short filaments captured by FH2 domains can elongate only by monomer addition . Analysis of the rates of the reactions showed that nucleation and annealing can account for faster elongation ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . We speculate that LifeAct – mCherry promotes nucleation by stabilizing actin oligomers by binding to an interface not available in filaments . LifeAct – mCherry also perturbs interactions of actin filaments with cofilin , a protein important for endocytosis and cytokinesis 26 , 27 . Cofilin binds cooperatively to filaments and severs at interfaces 678 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Thirty micromolar human cofilin 1 ( Hs cofilin ) saturated actin filaments 1 : 1 independent of the concentration of LifeAct – mCherry ( Fig . 3c ) , so the proteins bind independently to actin filaments . However , LifeAct – mCherry binding to cofilin - saturated actin filaments was cooperative ( cooperativity factor ω = 8 . 8 ) with much lower aﬃnity ( K d = 67 µ M ; Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Thus , cofilin weakens the aﬃnity of actin filaments for LifeAct – mCherry fivefold indirectly without competing for binding sites . LifeAct – mCherry can promote or inhibit actin filament severing by cofilin . Concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry well below the K d for binding to actin filaments markedly reduced severing by 20nM Schizosaccharomyces pombe cofilin ( Sp cofilin ; Fig . 4a , b ) . High concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry also inhibited severing by 5 , 10 or 20 µ M Hs cofilin ( Fig . 4c ) , which severs filaments optimally NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2016 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Conditions : actin ﬁlaments were preformed in the microscopy chamber by incubating 0 . 5 µ M actin monomers ( 20 % Alexa - 488 - labelled ) in microscopy buffer ( see Methods ) for ∼ 5min . The buffer containing unpolymerized actin monomers was replaced with the same buffer containing coﬁlin and LifeAct – mCherry . Images were collected over time by TIRF microscopy . ( a ) Representative time series of ﬂuorescent micrographs of preformed actin ﬁlaments incubated with 20nM Sp coﬁlin or 5 µ M Hs coﬁlin in the absence or presence of 1 . 5 or 1 µ M LifeAct – mCherry . ( b , c ) Dependence of the rate of actin ﬁlament severing on the concentration of LifeAct – mCherry . The units of severing activity are 10 − 4 severing events per micrometre of actin per second . Data represent one of three sets of independent experiments that each produced samples containing hundreds of ﬁlaments and severing events . ( b ) Severing by 20nM Sp coﬁlin .

( d ) Thermodynamic scheme of coﬁlin and LifeAct binding to two contiguous ﬁlamentous actin sites . The dashed rectangle outlines interactions between a single LifeAct ( L ) and coﬁlin ( C ) with a ﬁlamentous actin subunit ( F ) , resulting in LifeAct - bound actin ( L _ F ) , coﬁlin - bound actin ( F _ C ) and LifeAct - and coﬁlin - bound actin ( L _ F _ C ) ( no cooperativity ) . See Methods for a complete description of the model . Asterisks denote binding constants measured previously 40 . Daggers denote binding constants derived from detailed balance . at concentrations 1 , 000 × higher than Sp cofilin . On the other hand submicromolar LifeAct – mCherry concentrations stimulated severing ( Fig . 4c ) . Higher concentrations of Hs cofilin required higher concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry to stimulate severing ( Fig . 4c ) . A thermodynamic analysis ( see Methods ) shows that LifeAct – mCherry decreases the aﬃnity of cofilin for an isolated actin subunit fivefold ( Fig . 4d , dashed rectangle ) , decreases the number of initial ( no neighbour ) cofilin binding events , and favours nearest - neighbour binding of cofilin . These eﬀects suggest that these two proteins produce diﬀerent , incompatible changes in actin filament structure such as twist 33 and torsional flexibility 34 . It follows that LifeAct inhibits severing ( Fig . 4b ) by reducing the number of bound cofilins . Such conformational changes are also likely to inhibit filament elongation at saturating LifeAct – mCherry concentrations ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Given the eﬀects of mEGFP – LifeAct on endocytosis and cytokinesis , we explored how to use mEGFP – LifeAct to study actin filaments in live cells . The kinetics of actin patch assembly ( Fig . 1g ) and cytokinesis ( Fig . 2b ) in cells expressing low concentrations of mEGFP – LifeAct were indistinguishable from normal cells . However , higher cellular concentrations of mEGFP – LifeAct are required to measure the absolute numbers of polymerized actin in cellular structures . Therefore , we used endocytic patches to test the feasibility of titrating polymerized actin with mEGFP – LifeAct in live cells . As expected for a bimolecular reaction , the average peak numbers of mEGFP – LifeAct per patch increased with the concentration of free mEGFP – LifeAct ( Fig . 1h ) measured in parts of the cytoplasm without actin patches or actin cables . The binding curve fit to the data gave a K d = 20 . 0 ± 3 . 8 µ M ( Fig . 1h ) , similar to the aﬃnity measured in vitro . 680 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Times are in minutes , with zero deﬁned as the onset of constriction . ( a – c ) Numbers of mEGFP – LifeAct molecules in contractile rings counted with the segmentation method . ( a ) Time series of ﬂuorescence micrographs of a cell expressing mEGFP – LifeAct ( green ) and Rlc1p – tdTomato ( red ) .

Red dashed lines are mean densities of 5 , 840 and 996 molecules per micrometre . Inset : numbers of LifeAct molecules versus ring circumference in a cell expressing 30 µ M mEGFP – LifeAct . Solid red line is the linear best ﬁt ( R 2 = 0 . 97 ) .

The smooth red curves are the best ﬁts of equation ( 1 ) either without constraint ( R 2 = 0 . 48 ) or with the K d constrained to 9 . 3 µ M ( inset ) ( R 2 = 0 . 46 ) . Squares are average numbers of LifeAct molecules in rings in bins of 5 µ M mEGFP – LifeAct . Data are from six independent experiments . ( g ) The normalized average ﬂuorescence intensity of Crn1 – mEGFP in the cleavage furrows of n = 7 cells pooled across three independent experiments . Inset : dependence of peak numbers of LifeAct molecules in contractile rings ( blue dots ) , measured by the subtraction method , on concentration of free mEGFP – LifeAct . The smooth curve ( red line ) is the best ﬁt of equation ( 1 ) . Error bars show mean ± 1 s . d . Fitting an unconstrained binding reaction to the data extrapolated to a maximum of 7 , 000 ± 600 mEGFP – LifeAct molecules per patch . If we constrained the K d at 9 . 3 µ M , the value measured in vitro , the binding curve extrapolated to a maximum of 5 , 300 ± 180 mEGFP – LifeAct molecules per patch ( Fig . 1h inset ) . Thus , the peak number of 5 , 000 – 7 , 000 mEGFP – LifeAct molecules per patch is consistent with previous measurements made with either GFP – actin 5 , 15 , 35 or GFP – cofilin 27 . To characterize the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments during cytokinesis , we used low concentrations of mEGFP – LifeAct to measure the time course of actin assembly . Then we benchmarked this data at one time point with an estimate of the number of actin molecules by titration with a range of concentrations of mEGFP – LifeAct . We measured contractile ring fluorescence in cells expressing 6 µ M mEGFP – LifeAct , a concentration that had no eﬀect on the time course of contractile ring assembly ( Fig . 2b ) . We co - expressed Rlc1p – tdTomato to mark rings and used automated segmentation to separate the mEGFP – LifeAct fluorescence in contractile rings from actin patches ( Fig . 5a ) . Manually segmenting a sample of cells confirmed that automated segmentation included in rings only 2 – 3 actin patches per cell , a small fraction of the peak number of polymerized actin molecules in rings that we measured below . The fluorescence of mEGFP – LifeAct in contractile rings increased steadily during the 25min maturation stage ( Fig . 5b ) , peaking just before the onset of constriction ( designated as time zero ) . The mEGFP – LifeAct fluorescence decreased linearly over time as the contractile ring constricted ( Fig . 5a , b ) , so the density of actin filaments was constant throughout constriction ( Fig . 5c ) . For comparison , we show that the time course was similar and the fluorescence ∼ 6 - fold higher in a cell expressing 30 µ M mEGFP – LifeAct ( Fig . 5b , c ) . We used triple GFP tags to count the small numbers of the formins Cdc12p and For3p in rings ( Fig . 5d ) . Their numbers were constant during the maturation phase and for most of ring constriction , so the ratio of actin to formins declined linearly as rings constricted ( Fig . 5e ) . The numbers of both formins declined during the last part of constriction . NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2016 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved 681 L E T T E R S We used titration to count the number of mEGFP – LifeAct molecules in contractile rings ( Fig . 5f ) . The maximum number was about 150 , 000 in cells with the highest concentrations ( > 10 µ M ) of free cytoplasmic mEGFP – LifeAct ( binned averages , Fig . 5f ) . Fitting the binding equation to the dependence of contractile ring mEGFP – LifeAct on the free mEGFP – LifeAct concentrations gave a K d of 6 . 2 ± 1 . 8 µ M and extrapolated to a maximum of 190 , 000 ± 20 , 000 mEGFP – LifeAct per ring . If we constrained the K d to 9 . 3 µ M ( measured in vitro ) , the binding curve extrapolated to a maximum of 221 , 000 ± 8 , 000 mEGFP – LifeAct per ring ( Fig . 5f , inset ) . Assuming 1 : 1 binding , contractile rings contain ∼ 190 , 000 polymerized actin molecules . An alternative approach subtracted the contributions from actin patches ( Fig . 5g ) from the total fluorescence around the equator to measure actin numbers ( Fig . 5g , inset ) . This method indicates that the ring is flanked by another ∼ 94 , 000 polymerized actins including short - lived whiskers 26 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Electron microscopy of thin sections has provided information about the size and shape of contractile rings since the 1970s 36 , but preserving , resolving and counting individual actin filaments is challenging . Electron micrographs of intact fission yeast cells showed actin filaments in contractile rings 37 , but the data were too limited to estimate the numbers of filaments . The authors of ref . 38 digested the fissionyeastcellwallandpermeabilizedtheplasmamembranetoallow decoration of actin filaments with myosin subfragment - 1 . Decorating with myosin stabilized filaments during fixation and revealed their polarity . From electron micrographs of serial sections of six cells they estimated that fission yeast contractile rings contained 1 , 100 – 2 , 100 filaments between 450 and 610nm long for a total of about 920 , 000 actin molecules per ring . This larger number may arise from the cell cycle arrest and release used in this work or challenges of measuring actin filaments by electron microscopy . Knowing the peak number of 190 , 000 actin subunits in the contractile ring , we calculated that a cross - section of the ring has ∼ 50 filaments . As the ring is ∼ 125nm wide 37 , the centre - to - centre spacing of the filaments is ∼ 15nm . During ring constriction , this density of polymerized actin is constant , but the number of actin molecules declines in proportion to the circumference , as first shown by electron microscopy of echinoderm embryos 36 . As the formins Cdc12 and For3p nucleate these filaments 5 , 11 , 39 , the ratio of actin to formin molecules gives average filament lengths ∼ 1 . 4 µ m at the onset of constriction and declining linearly as the actin departs before the formins . The 9 , 000 mEGFP – LifeAct molecules bound at the peak in the time course experiment ( Fig . 5b , 6 µ M ) are unlikely to interfere withthe2 , 900Myo2pmolecules , 2 , 000Myp2molecules , 500 α - actinin molecules and 1 , 300 Rng2 IQGAP molecules associated with the ring 5 . Likeanyprobeinanyphysicalsystem , LifeActfusedtoafluorescent protein is bound to influence actin assembly in cells . One must be aware of the hazards and use probe concentrations that limit its eﬀects . Fortunately , the negative eﬀects on actin patches and cytokinesis depend on the concentration of mEGFP – LifeAct , so minding the concentration allows for its use . Although formins and profilin temper the negative eﬀects , we caution users to measure the concentration of LifeAct fusion proteins in their cells and keep the concentration of LifeAct in the low micromolar range unless they need to measure the total numbers of polymerized actin molecules .

ThegeneforthefusionproteinmEGFP – glycine – serine – LifeAct was incorporated into the leu locus and controlled by the strong 3nmt1 promoter 18 . Cells were grown in EMM5S medium without thiamine for 15 – 20h to induce the expression of mEGFP – LifeAct . Heterogeneous expression of mEGFP – LifeAct ( Fig . 1a ) was observed in more than 10 independent experiments . Growth comparisons between the wild type and the cells expressing P3nmt1 – mEGFP – LifeAct ( Fig . 1c ) were consistent in repeated experiments . To drive expression of 6 µ M mEGFP – LifeAct , we sub - cloned the constitutive adf1 ( cofilin ) promoter and madeapFA6a – Padf1 – mEGFP – LifeAct – KanMX6vectorthatwasintegratedintothe leu locus through the standard lithium acetate transformation .

Fluorescence imaging . We imaged live yeast cells on a pad of 25 % gelatin in EMM5S with an Olympus IX71 microscope with a spinning - disc confocal unit ( Yokogawa , CSU10 ) and an EMCCD ( electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ) camera ( Andor , X1 ) calibratedtocountthenumbersoffluorescentproteinmolecules in each pixel . We stained the actin filaments in fixed cells by fixing with 5 % formaldehyde for 5min in TEM buﬀer ( 0 . 1M Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 1mM EGTA , 1mM MgCl 2 ) , washingwithTEMbuﬀerthreetimesfor1mineach , permeabilizingwith1 % Triton X - 100 in TEM for 5min and washing with TEM buﬀer before treatment with 8 µ M Alexa 568 – phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) in TEM buﬀer for 10min . Cells were mounted on 25 % gelatin pads for microscopy . Cells were also stained with either rhodamine – phalloidin or Bodipy – phallacidin with similar results . We counted actin molecules in cellular structures by titration with mEGFP – LifeAct , which binds polymerized actin stoichiometrically ( Fig . 3a ) . The concept 41 is to vary the concentration of the fluorescent ligand in the cell and measure the numbers of ligand molecules associated with cellular structures , in this case endocytic actin patches and contractile rings . The bimolecular reaction is : LA Free + FActin Free ↔ LA · FActin We verified this reaction by measuring bound mEGFP – LifeAct as a function of LA free ( LA : LifeAct ) andcalculatingthe K d representingthedissociationequilibrium constant . K d = [ LA Free ] [ FActin Free ] [ LA · FActin ] ( 1 ) Fittingequation ( 1 ) tothecellularbindingdataallowedustoestimateLA – FActin when we could not saturate the LifeAct binding site directly . Image analysis . We analysed fluorescence images with Image J ( NIH ) and Matlab ( Mathworks ) . We measured the total number of mEGFP – LifeAct molecules in each cell from the total fluorescence in a stack of confocal Z - sections and a calibration curve . The total volume of a cell was calculated from its length as the volume of a cylinder plus a sphere ( assuming diameter D = 3 . 74 µ m ) : Volume = π D 2 (cid:18) 1 4 L − 1 12 D (cid:19) ( 2 ) Weestimatedthelength ( L ) ofeachcellbymeasuringthetotalareaofitslongitudinal cross - section . We calculated the concentration of LA in the cytoplasm from the total number of mEGFP – LifeAct molecules divided by the cytoplasmic volume of cells , which is 29 % of total cellular volume 5 . We calculated the free mEGFP – LifeAct concentration in the cytoplasm from measurements of fluorescence in an area ( S ) free of actin cytoskeletal structures on the medial slice of Z - series fluorescence micrographs ( interval = 0 . 36 µ m ) ofacell . ThefreeLifeActconcentrationequalsthetotalnumber of mEGFP – LifeAct molecules in the area divided by the volume ( S × 0 . 36 µ m 3 ) . We used a computer - assisted semi - automated Image J plug - in to track actin patches in > 100 cells in three independent experiments . To measure the number of actin patches flanking the cleavage furrow , we made three - dimensional reconstructionsfromstacksoffluorescencemicrographsofaregionofinterest1 µ m on both sides of the contractile ring . We counted the numbers of actin patches from two diﬀerent viewing angles of the furrow and averaged . We segmented contractile rings to count mEGFP – LifeAct with custom NIH Image J macros and Matlab scripts using the fluorescence of Rlc1p – tdTomato to mark the contractile ring . We measured contractile ring assembly in 73 cells and ring constriction in 87 cells . Localization of mEGFP – LifeAct in the cleavage furrow was analysed in more than 50 cells . Analternativeapproachtocountthenumberofactinmoleculesinthecontractilering . The total mEGFP – LifeAct in a band 2 µ m wide centred on the cleavage furrow was much higher than in the segmented ring owing to the presence of actin patches , whiskers of actin on the sides of contractile rings and actin cables . We measured the number of actin patches near contractile rings from the fluorescence of mEGFP – Crn1p ( coronin ) . The number of patches was constant at 19 ± 2 ( n = 5 ) during ring constriction ( Fig . 5g ) . We estimated the numbers of mEGFP – LifeAct molecules bound to 19 actin patches at each concentration of cytoplasmic mEGFP – LifeAct from the average number of actin molecules per patch of 3 , 000 ( = 6 , 000 / 2 ) .

These counts were about 50 % higher than numbers counted by segmenting rings ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , so additional actin filaments flank the ring . Protein purification . LifeAct – mCherry : LifeAct ( sequence : MGVADLIKKFES ISKEE ) , followed by a linker ( sequence : RIPGLIN ) and the sequence for mCherry was cloned into a pGEX – 4T3 vector , which added an N - terminal GST fusion and a thrombin cleavage site . After cleavage with thrombin , the protein began with Gly - Ser , followed by the LifeAct sequence . The construct was expressed in BL21 DE3 cells with 0 . 5mM IPTG ( added once the cells reached an optical density of 0 . 8 at 595nm ) and incubation at 16 ◦ C overnight . After collection , cell pellets were resuspended in 10ml of 50mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 300mM NaCl , 1mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) per gram of cells . The cells were lysed by sonication , and ∼ 100ml of clarified supernatant was incubated with 6ml of glutathione – Sepharose resin ( GE Healthcare ) for 1h with rotation at 4 ◦ C . The lysate and the resin were thenpouredintoaglasscolumnandtheresinwaswashedwith100mloflysisbuﬀer . Fiftyunitsofthrombin ( < 1 % oftheconcentrationofLifeAct – mCherry ) wereadded to the column and incubated at 4 ◦ C overnight . The protein was then eluted with lysis buﬀer , dialysed into KMEI buﬀer ( 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 10mMimidazole ( pH7 . 0 ) , 1mMDTT ) , flash - frozenandstoredat − 80 ◦ C . Purified LifeAct – mCherry ( up to 50 µ M ) was incubated with monomeric and filamentous actin for 30min at room temperature . Analysis of the proteins by SDS – PAGE , Coomassie blue staining and densitometry of bands with ImageJ confirmed that no actin was degraded in the presence of the remaining thrombin . mEGFP – LifeAct . We sub - cloned the coding sequence of mEGFP – glycine – serine – LifeAct into the pGEX6P - 1 vector ( GE Healthcare ) with a Precision Protease cleavage site engineered between the sequences of GST and mEGFP – LifeAct . We induced the expression of recombinant GST – mEGFP – LifeAct in 2 - litre cultures of BL21 - CordonPlus - RIL cells ( Stratagene ) with 0 . 25mM IPTG overnight at 20 ◦ C . Bacteria were collected and lysed by sonication in 50ml of lysis buﬀer ( 20mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 400mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 1mM DTT ) with 0 . 5mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and 1 tablet of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Roche , eComplete ) .

Afterwashingthecolumnwith10columnvolumes of lysis buﬀer , we incubated the column overnight at 4 ◦ C with 1ml of lysis buﬀer containing 50 units of Precision Protease ( GST tagged , GE Healthcare ) and eluted mEGFP – LifeAct with 9ml of column buﬀer . We measured fusion protein concentrations by absorbance at 280 nm using theoretical extinction coeﬃcients of 34 , 380M − 1 cm − 1 for LifeAct – mCherry and of 21 , 890M − 1 cm − 1 for mEGFP – LifeAct . Muscle actin . Actin was purified from an acetone powder of frozen chicken skeletal muscle ( Trader Joe’s ) using one cycle of polymerization and depolymerization followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S - 300 and storage in Ca - Buﬀer - G ( 2mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 2mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM NaN 3 , 0 . 5mM DTT ) . The concentration of actin was measured by absorbance at 290nm with an extinction coeﬃcient of 26 , 600M − 1 cm − 1 . Actin was polymerized in 50mM PIPES , pH 6 . 8 , 50mM KCl , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2mM ATP and labelled on lysines by incubating overnight at 4 ◦ C with a 13 : 1molar ratio of Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester ( A - 20000 , Invitrogen ) to actin . After depolymerization , clarification and gel filtration on Sephacryl S - 300 , purified actin monomers were typically ∼ 30 – 50 % labelled . Cofilins . S . pombe ( Sp ) and human ( Hs ) cofilin were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells with 1mM IPTG at 37 ◦ C for 4h . About 8g of cells © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Following clarification of the lysate , Sp cofilin was precipitated with 70 % ammonium sulfate , resuspended in 20ml of 10mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 1mM NaN 3 , 1mM EDTA , 250mM NaCl , and 2mM DTT and gel - filtered on a 400 - ml column of Sephacryl S - 200 . Peak cofilin fractions were dialysed in 25mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 4 , and 2mM DTT , loaded on a 20ml DEAE - Sepharose column and eluted with a 500 - ml gradient of 0 – 500mM NaCl in DEAE buﬀer . About 8g of cells expressing Hs cofilin were resuspended in 70ml of 10mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1mM EGTA , and 2mM DTT and lysed by sonication . Following clarification of the lysate by centrifugation at 21 , 200 g for 45min , the supernatant was applied to a 20ml DEAE - Sepharose column , and the flow - through of ∼ 70ml was dialysed versus 2l of 150mM NaCl , 10mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2mM DTT . The protein was then gel - filtered on a 400 - ml column of Sephacryl S - 200 resin in the dialysis buﬀer . Following purification , both Hs and Sp cofilin were dialysed in KMEI buﬀer , concentrated in centrifuge filter devices ( Corning Glass , 10 - kDa molecular mass cutoﬀ ) , flash - frozen and stored at − 80 ◦ C . Co - sedimentation assays . We measured aﬃnity and stoichiometry of mEGFP – LifeAct and LifeAct – mCherry binding to chicken skeletal muscle actin filaments with a pelleting assay . Actin was polymerized in KMEI buﬀer and incubated with a range of concentrations of mEGFP – LifeAct or LifeAct – mCherry for 30 – 60min at room temperature . Some reactions contained 30 µ M Hs cofilin . Reactions were centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 30min . Supernatants or pellets from 3 independent experiments were analysed by SDS – PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue . Band intensities were measured with ImageJ software . TIRF microscopy . Glass flow chambers were incubated for 1min each with 0 . 5 % Tween 80 in high - salt Tris - buﬀered saline ( HS - TBS ; 50mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 600mM KCl ) , 250nM N - ethylmaleimide - inactivated skeletal muscle myosin in HS - TBS , and 10 % BSA ( w / v ) in HS - TBS , with washes of HS - TBS after each incubation step . Polymerization was initiated by mixing 0 . 5 µ M actin monomers ( 20 % labelled with Alexa 488 ) with or without formin or profilin and a range of concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry in standard microscopy buﬀer ( 10mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50mM KCl , 1mM EGTA , 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 3mM ATP , 15mM glucose , 50mM DTT , 0 . 02 µ M CaCl 2 , 20 µ gml − 1 catalase , 100 µ gml − 1 glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose ( 4 , 000 cP at 2 % ( w / v ) ) ) . Formin - mediated elongation experiments were performed with 200nM Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p or 50nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p . Bni1p can elongate barbed ends in the absence of profilin , whereas Cdc12p cannot . Therefore , experiments with Bni1p were performed in the absence of profilin , whereas all experiments performed with Cdc12p included profilin . The concentrations of formin used are a reflection of the amount of formin required to nucleate and elongate a suﬃcient number of filaments for data acquisition and analysis , and do not aﬀect the measured rates . For severing experiments , 0 . 5 µ M actin was polymerized in the chamber until filaments were visible . Unpolymerized monomers were then exchanged with a fresh sample of proteins ( that is , LifeAct – mCherry and cofilin ) in microscopy buﬀer , and imaging was continued . Severing data were obtained from 2 to 3 independent experiments that each produced samples containing hundreds of filaments and severing events . Fluorescence micrographs were collected every 5 – 10s using prism - style TIRF microscopy on an Olympus IX - 70 inverted microscope and a Hamamatsu C4747 - 95CCD ( Orca - ER ) cameracontrolledbyMetaMorphsoftware ( MolecularDevices ) . Changes in filament length were measured using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) for at least 10 filaments in 2 to 4 independent experiments , typically over a span of at least 300s . We assumed 370 actin subunits per µ m of filament 42 . Thermodynamic analysis of LifeAct – mCherry and cofilin binding to actin filaments . Cofilin binds actin filaments cooperatively , with greater aﬃnity for sites with cofilin bound to neighbouring subunits . These interactions are best described by a model for cooperative binding to singly contiguous ( one nearest neighbour ) siteswithabindingaﬃnity K app ω , where K app istheapparentassociationequilibrium constant and ω is the cooperativity coeﬃcient . We found that even though LifeAct – mCherryandcofilincanbindsimultaneouslytoactinfilaments , saturatingfilaments with cofilin decreases their aﬃnity for LifeAct – mCherry ( Fig . 3c ) . The best fit of a singly contiguous cooperative model to LifeAct – mCherry – actin binding data had a cooperativity factor ω of 8 . 8 , which is similar to the value of ω ( 8 . 5 ) for cofilin binding actin filaments 28 . Using our measured actin - binding constants for LifeAct – mCherry and published parameters for cofilin 40 , we built a thermodynamic model that describes LifeAct – mCherry and cofilin binding to two contiguous filamentous actin subunits ( Fig . 4d ) . This minimal model describes both an initial binding event ( no nearest neighbours ) and a subsequent binding event to a site with a bound neighbour . We determined values for unknown binding constants by applying a detailed balance . The top row of the model defines reactions for cofilin binding to two contiguous actin subunits . The first cofilin binds with a K d of 23 µ M to form F _ C . Owing to nearest - neighbourcooperativity , thesecondcofilinbindsnexttothefirstwitha K d of 1 . 4 µ M . The left column defines reactions for LifeAct binding to two actin subunits . LifeAct does not bind cooperatively to actin in the absence of cofilin , so the binding constants are the same for both binding reactions ( 13 µ M ) . Other reactions in the scheme define binding of LifeAct to partially and fully cofilin - decorated actin , and vice versa . The aﬃnity of LifeAct for a cofilin - bound actin subunit was determined from the fit to the binding data in Fig . 3c , which produced a K d of 67 µ M and a cooperativity factor ( ω ) of 8 . 8 . As this value of ω is nearly identical to that measured for cofilin , we used the same values of ω + and ω − as reported for cofilin previously 40 to determine the aﬃnity of LifeAct to a cofilin - bound actin subunit with a nearest neighbour bound to LifeAct and cofilin ( K d = 4 . 0 ) . LifeAct – mCherry decreases the aﬃnity of cofilin for an isolated actin subunit fivefold ( Fig . 4d , dashed rectangle ) . However , the aﬃnity of cofilin for a binding site with a cofilin - bound neighbour is roughly independent of LifeAct – mCherry . Thus , for a given concentration of cofilin , the number of initial ( no neighbour ) cofilin binding events decreases in the presence of LifeAct – mCherry , so nearest - neighbour binding of cofilin becomes an increasingly predominant mode of filament saturation . Cofilinisknowntoalteractinfilamenttwist 33 andincreasetorsionalflexibility 34 . Given non - overlapping sites on actin , the lower aﬃnities of cofilin and LifeAct – mCherry for actin in each other’s presence suggest that these two proteins produce diﬀerent and incompatible changes in actin filament structure . Cofilin severs optimally when the number of interfaces between decorated and undecorated filament segments is high . For Sp cofilin , this occurs at nanomolar concentrations , which decorate filaments with a low density of singly bound cofilins 28 . At these concentrations , a fivefold decrease in the aﬃnity of cofilin for binding sites without a neighbouring cofilin will decrease the number of binding events , resulting in fewer decorated segments . This eﬀect ultimately reduces the number of severing events ( Fig . 4b ) . On the other hand , reducing the aﬃnity of cofilin for actin sites without a neighbouring cofilin will not aﬀect the extent of filament decoration by concentrations of cofilin that normally saturate actin filaments ( for example , 5 – 20 µ M ) at equilibrium . However , it is likely to slow the kinetics of cofilin binding to sites without a neighbouring cofilin and therefore the initiation of new decorated segments . This will increase the lifetimes of interfaces between decorated and undecoratedsegmentsandincreasefilamentseveringinthekineticregime ( Fig . 4c ) . Higher concentrations of LifeAct – mCherry will slow cofilin binding to sites without a neighbouring cofilin , causing an increasing proportion of filament decoration to occur through nearest - neighbour binding of cofilin . This will ultimately result in longer , but fewer decorated segments , and therefore decreased filament severing ( Fig . 4c ) . The extent of filament saturation by LifeAct – mCherry in turn depends on the cofilin concentration . As the aﬃnity of LifeAct – mCherry for actin is inversely proportional to cofilin concentration , the concentration of LifeAct – mCherry that produces maximal severing increases with cofilin concentration ( Fig . 4c ) .

( E ) Dependence of the concentration of additional nucleated filaments required to increase the polymerization rate three - fold on the time it takes each filament to anneal . Concentrations of nuclei were calculated using the length - dependent annealing rate measured by Andrianantoandro et al 20 and assuming that nucleated filaments elongate with normal rate constants ( i . e . k + = 12 . 9 µM - 1 s - 1 , k - = 1 . 3 s - 1 ) before annealing together . This experiment demonstrates that subnanomolar to low nanomolar concentrations of nucleated filaments are sufficient to increase the elongation rate of growing filament ends .
