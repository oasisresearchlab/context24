A Cross - Country Study of Innovation and Religiosity By J . KALU OSIRI , BORIS HOUENOU , AND ROBERTO STEIN * We look at the relationship between religion and innovation at the country level . Innovation is captured by the Global Innovation Index and certain innovation outputs . Religiosity is measured across 141 countries in terms of religious belonging , belief , and intolerance . In addition , we look at the effect of religion on patent applications and university - industry collaboration . Across all specifications , greater religiosity is negatively associated with innovation , with the strongest effects observed for religious intolerance . We find the negative relationship is robust to all religions , except for the Church of Sweden , where we see a strong position association . * Osiri : College of Business , HLH 325K , The University of Nebraska - Lincoln , P .

Introduction There is abundant research establishing a positive correlation between innovation and economic growth and a growing body of work that examines the relationship between religion and innovative behavior . This paper adds to the discourse by studying how religiosity as a cultural construct relates to innovation , which is necessary for national development . In the frenzied pace of globalization , innovation is an essential prerequisite for economic growth and , some posit , survival ( Westwood and Low , 2003 ) . Therefore , it is critical to decipher the relationship between religiosity and innovation , especially considering the pervasiveness of religion worldwide . There is evidence linking national culture to innovation ( Tsui , Nifadkar , and Ou 2007 ) but , extant research on innovation is essentially devoid on the role of religion , even though religion can shape social structures and socialize its believers ( Neuberg et al . , 2014 ) . Guiso et al . ( 2003 ) and Guiso et al . ( 2010 ) noted that a possible pathway by which religion leads to economic growth is that it makes religious persons more ethical ( e . g . , less likely to accept bribe and cheat on taxes ) , which is conducive for increased economic growth . Supporting Guiso et al . ( 2003 ) , in a cross - national study that used data on 63 , 087 individuals from 44 countries , Parboteeah , Hoegl and Cullen ( 2008 ) found that religious persons were less likely to justify ethically unacceptable behaviors and argued that previous mixed religion - ethics conclusions in the literature were mostly due to methodological and conceptual limitations . Using a panel of cross - country data , Barro and McCleary ( 2003 ) found mixed relationships between religiosity and the economy , with belief in heaven and hell having a positive effect on economic growth , but belonging – specifically , religious attendance , having a negative effect . In other studies , analytic thinking was found to be negatively associated with disbelief in God , whereas belief in God was positively associated with social and emotional cognition ( Zuckerman , Silberman , Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 3 and Hall , 2013 ) . In a more recent study , Jack , Friedman , Boyatzis , and Taylor ( 2016 ) found religious belief to be positively associated with moral concern but negatively associated with analytic thinking . However , none of the works investigated the relationship between religiosity and innovation . Roland Benabou , Davide Ticchi , and Andrea Vindigni found negative associations between religiosity and patents per capita ( 2013 ) and attitudes towards innovation ( 2015 ) . This is the first study , which investigates religion and actual innovation . National innovation measures can be used to capture the overall economic health of a nation . Further , innovation appears to be related to the intellectual and human capability of a nation ( Jiménez‐Jiménez & Sanz‐Valle , 2005 ) . The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) confirms that : “empirical studies find persistent differences in the long - term performance of countries and markedly different patterns of national technological specialization . ” 1 Even among countries that show a broad convergence in macroeconomic performance as do the OECD countries , their technological profiles and innovation capabilities diverge considerably . It is believed that countries tend to develop along certain technological paths… determined by past and present patterns of knowledge accumulation . “Which path a country takes is determined largely by institutional factors , often specific to a country , including the broad range of interactions which characterize the national innovation system . ” 2 Thus , innovation is a good measure for development . Prior studies have shown that predilection to religious fundamentalism can obstruct innovation on a personal and national level . For example , political conservatives , who tend to be more religious , are less creative ( Dollinger , 2007 ) , 1 OECD . 1997 . “National Innovation Systems . ” Retrieved on June 8 , 2018 , from http : / / www . oecd . org / science / inno / 2101733 . pdf 2 OECD . 1997 . “National Innovation Systems . ” Pg . 14 . Retrieved on June 8 , 2018 , from http : / / www . oecd . org / science / inno / 2101733 . pdf Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 4 oppose scientific research ( e . g . stem cell research ) , and value religious tradition and old ideas , which is deleterious to innovation . Using the proportion of people in the creative occupations in US counties and number of patents from those counties as measures of creativity—a precursor to innovation— Okulicz - Kozaryn ( 2015 ) found a negative correlation between creativity and religiosity , which was captured using the number of adherents per population and church density . Bénabou , Ticchi and Vindigni ( 2013 ) investigated the impact of religiosity on patents per capita and showed a significant negative relationship between religiosity and the log patents per capita , which served as proxy for innovation , and the results were similar for their cross - country analysis . In a follow - up religion / innovation study , using data from the World Values Survey , Bénabou et al . ( 2015 ) regressed eleven attitudinal measures of innovation on five measures of religiosity ( Religious Person , Belief in God , Importance of Religion , Importance of God , and Religious Attendance ) and found overwhelming support of a negative relationship between religiosity and attitudes towards innovation . The study went beyond the typical GDP growth and patent outcomes to explore the possible impact of religiosity on attitudes towards innovation . But there is reason to be cautious as Zysberg and Schenk ( 2013 ) reported inconclusive results for the relationship between religiosity and creativity . Given the volume of paintings , sculptures , poems , and music depicting religious themes , in fact , religiosity may be having a positive relationship with creativity ( Day , 2005 ) . This paper contributes to the overall body of knowledge on innovation because it goes beyond the innovation attitudes outcomes in the Bénabou et al . ( 2015 ) study . Instead of attitudes towards innovation , which were the dependent variables in the Bénabou et al . ( 2015 ) study , we focused on two other measures : innovation capability and actual innovation . To measure innovation capability , we used Global Innovation Index ( GII ) scores , and to measure actual innovation , we Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 5 used innovation outputs of each country as the dependent variables , respectively . In our analyses , we made efforts to retain most of the religious measures in the work of Bénabou et al . ( 2015 ) in our set of independent variables . II . From ‘Attitudes Toward Innovation’ To ‘Actual Innovation’ It has been well - established that attitude does not always translate into action ( LaPiere , 1934 ) . According to the Theory of Reasoned Action ( Ajzen and Fishbein , 1975 ) and Theory of Planned Behavior ( Ajzen , 1991 ) , for attitudes to become an action , it must be accompanied by intentionality . We , therefore , reasoned that a similar relationship is likely to exist between attitudes toward innovation and actual innovation at the macro level . For example , it is possible that prevailing social institutions and national infrastructure may mediate or moderate the relationship between attitudes towards innovation and actual innovation , thereby attenuating , exacerbating , or even reversing the effects of religion on attitudes toward innovation . In fact , once viewed as a cultural construct it becomes apparent that religion can be treated as variable whose effects could possibly be mediated or moderated by other factors . Peng and Lin ( 2009 ) , for example , identified education as a mediator between culture and economic performance . Mayfield and Mayfield ( 2012 ) found that national culture significantly influenced the development of infrastructure , which in turn boosted GDP . As religion has been found to be negatively associated with attitudinal measures of innovation ( Bénabou et al . , 2015 ) , we make the case that additional research is needed to show that negative attitudes do in fact translate to low levels of innovation . We view the link between attitudes towards innovation and actual innovation to be innovation capability , which is captured by GII scores . Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 6 III . Measures of Innovation and Religiosity Our contribution to the body of knowledge is that we escalated the discourse from “attitudes towards innovation” to “actual innovation . ” As such , a measure that truly and more comprehensively captures innovation is required . Instead of attitudes towards innovation , we turned to the Global Innovation Index for a measure we call innovation capability and actual innovation . However , we kept all measures of religiosity from previous research ( Bénabou et al . , 2015 ) and added a new category – religious intolerance . A . Rationale for Using Global Innovation Index ( GII ) Bénabou et al . ( 2015 ) used three variables to elucidate attitudes towards innovation . The variables were determined by World Values Survey statements regarding attitudes towards science and technology to which respondents had indicated their level of ( dis ) agreement . The statements are : 1 ) Attitudes toward science and technology ( e . g . “We depend too much on science and not enough on faith” ) , 2 ) Attitudes toward new ideas , change , and risk - taking ( e . g . “It is important to think up new ideas and be creative ; to do things one’s own way” ) , and 3 ) Attitudes toward child qualities ( e . g . Qualities that children can be encouraged to learn at home , especially important is imagination ) . In our case , innovation capability was captured by the Global Innovation Index ( GII ) co - published by Cornell University , INSEAD , and the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) . GII is indeed a unique combination of input and output variables that relate to innovation . The innovation inputs include : ( 1 ) Institutions , ( 2 ) Human capital and research , ( 3 ) Infrastructure , ( 4 ) Market sophistication , and ( 5 ) Business sophistication ; and the innovation outputs include : ( 6 ) Knowledge and technology outputs and ( 7 ) Creative outputs . Each of the seven factors is composed of sub - indicators ( 79 in total ) , which provide scores that are Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 7 calculated as the weighted average of the sub - indicators ( Dutta , Lanvin , and Wunsch - Vincent , 2015 ) . Based on 141 countries , representing 95 . 1 % of the world’s population and 98 . 6 % of global GDP , the GII scores capture key innovation drivers beyond traditional measures such as patents and the level of research and development . The GII score suggests the ability of a country to efficiently convert innovation inputs ( items 1 - 5 ) into outputs ( items 6 - 7 , which we used as the proxy for actual innovation ) . Therefore , in addition to studying the religiosity - innovation capability dynamic , we equally investigated the relationship between religiosity and actual innovation . The latter was measured by knowledge and technology outputs and creative outputs . B . The Different Shades of Religiosity : Belonging , Belief , and Intolerance Relevant literature for this study can be drawn from economics and business ( theory of innovation in organizations ) . Barro and McCleary ( 2003 ) distinguished religious belief from religious belonging . They found economic growth to be positively related to religious beliefs ( that is , belief in hell and heaven or afterlife ) but negatively related to religious belonging ( that is , church attendance ) . They viewed measures of beliefs and belonging as the outputs and inputs of the religious sector , with belonging ( output ) being more resource intensive compared to beliefs ( input ) . Building on this , we added a third aspect of religion – religious intolerance as an extreme form of religious belief that resists new knowledge acquisition . Defined as extreme bias against those who hold different opinions from oneself , intolerance is indeed associated with religious extremism in many societies ( Iannaccone & Berman , 2006 ) . As such , it is imperative to investigate how religious intolerance may differ from mere belief and belonging . We captured religious belonging using World Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 8 Values Survey ( WVS ) responses that measure the extent to which people are active in religious organizations and rate of attendance . For religious belief , we used WVS responses related to the extent to which : religion is important to respondents , persons are religious , people believe in God , God is important in the lives of persons , and the extent to which respondents believe in Hell . For religious intolerance , we used WVS responses that measure the extent to which people believe that their religion is the only valid religion as well as the extent to which religion is correct if there is a conflict between science and religion ( religious dogma ) . IV . Foundations of Innovation : Extending Organizational Theories To makes sense of the religiosity - innovation dynamic , we draw from three organizational theories and apply them to the national context . The theories , namely : Resource - based view ( RBV ) theory , Knowledge - based view ( KBV ) theory , and Learning theory ( derived from the Organizational learning theory ) explain how organizations develop their innovation capabilities ( Ozkaya , 2011 ) . We speculate that these theories are equally potent in explaining how nations develop innovation capabilities . There is no debate that innovation is important and critical for firm survival and national advancement . New product innovations accounted for forty percent of sales within a five - year span ( Schmidt and aka , 2002 ) and one - third of profits ( Sivadas and Dwyer , 2000 ) within firms . At a macro level , innovation leads to economic growth ( Grossman and Helpman , 1992 ) . Nonetheless , innovation is costly and requires significant investments in research and development by firms e . g . DiMasi , Hansen , and Grabowski , 1991 and countries e . g . National Science Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 9 Foundation , 2012 . 3 Therefore , developing innovation capabilities is imperative not only to reduce the risks and costs associated with innovative activities but also to maximize the benefits associated with innovation processes . Every innovation process needs inputs in the form of resources , tangible or intangible . For firms , resources are converted into useful products . These resources are financial , human , physical , and intangible ( e . g . knowhow ) assets , without which the process of innovation cannot begin . The RBV provides the basis for firms to develop competitive advantage by leveraging their resources ( Wernerfelt , 1984 ) . By extension , since innovation gives countries competitive advantages ( Porter , 1990 ) , the RBV can explain how countries develop these advantages by leveraging the resources at its disposal . The KBV and RBV theories are essentially the same , except that the former emphasizes knowledge as the most important resource ( Eisenhardt and Santos , 2002 ) while the latter embraces all forms of resources . The KBV , therefore , advocates that a country can develop competitive advantages by leveraging and building up its knowledge capacity . KBV highlights the vibrancy of knowledge as that element that can be transformed into , or be leveraged to create other , resources and innovation capabilities . Thus , the KBV presents innovation as a Schumpeterian “creative destruction” process because innovation is about two things : creating new knowledge and change over time ( Nonaka and Takeuchi , 1995 ) . Viewed in this light , the KBV theory may not be compatible with any religious belief that resists change . On the contrary , the KBV theory may support the argument put forth by Bénabou et al . ( 2015 ) that new ways of thinking are corrosive to religious beliefs . 3 National Science Foundation . 2012 . “Research & Development , Innovation , and the Science & Engineering Workforce . ” Retrieved June 8 , 2018 , from http : / / www . nsf . gov / nsb / publications / 2012 / nsb1203 . pdf Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 10 Innovation capabilities in firms ( Ozkaya , 2011 ) have been implicated in the transformation of resources into products . This is an important point to be made since mere resources are not tantamount to advantage . Likewise , given predefined innovation outcomes , the GII score approximates the innovation capabilities of a nation because it represents innovation efficiency - how a nation can convert five innovation inputs ( institutions , human capital and research , infrastructure , market sophistication , and business sophistication ) into innovation outputs ( knowledge and technology outputs and creative outputs ) . GII scores are superior in that they capture key innovation drivers beyond traditional measures such as patents and the level of research and development , which are sub - factors of the GII score . Having established the necessity of resources ( RBV ) and knowledge ( KBV ) in developing innovation capability , it is important to underscore that it takes a culture of learning to transform knowledge into capabilities ( Cohen et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , the connection between the KBV and the Learning Theory ( LT ) cannot be overemphasized since the two are intertwined : learning is the vehicle through which knowledge is acquired . Countries must create an environment that fosters learning in order to be able to develop innovation capabilities . This implies that new knowledge is required to create innovation . National Innovation Systems ( NISs ) comprise of key elements , including scientific research and education , for developing a national innovation capability ( Lundvall , 2007 ) . Given the right environment , knowledge acquired by individuals , units , and systems is readily assimilated by the NIS through the appropriate channels to create new products and processes . Therefore , if effective organizational learning leads to desired outcomes , such as greater profitability ( Slater and Narver , 1995 ) , one would expect analogous national level outcomes when learning occurs effectively in the NIS . Unfortunately , the NIS , like the organization ( Abbey and Dickson , 1983 ) can routinize innovation processes and develop memories that become old and stale , Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 11 which ultimately inhibits future innovations ( Leonard - Barton , 1992 ) . Religious beliefs become dogmatic when the adherents insist on being correct at all cost . This rigid form of belief is counterproductive , resists learning , and blocks innovation . V . Hypotheses Given our focus on three categories of religiosity and two measures of innovation , we dedicate this section to develop six hypotheses . Specifically , there were two measures of religious belonging , five measures of religious belief , and two measures of religious intolerance . We did not formulate any hypotheses related to number of patent application and type of religion . A . Religious Belonging and Innovation McCleary and Barro ( 2006 ) distinguished religious beliefs from religious belonging . They found that higher belief levels relative to belonging encourages economic growth . “Given beliefs , ” they explained , “more time and resources spent on formal religion can be viewed as a drain on resources , which detracts from the market output ( GDP ) . ” We concur with this statement , which is consistent with the RBV and suggests that there may be negative correlation between religious belonging and innovation . There are three conduits via which resources are drained away from NISs ; namely : governments and non - affiliated groups , the religious entity itself , and the adherents . First , considering that governments are key players of the NIS , their actions can catalyze or inhibit religious activities . For example , they can provide resources and assistance in the form of tax breaks to religious organizations , which can then Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 12 foster religious belonging and practices in the country . The assumption is that politicians , acting through the government , deem religious organizations as worthy recipients of these sorts of benefits because the religious adherents nay be members of their constituency . In addition , unaffiliated and nonreligious persons and groups who sympathize or identify with religion may be willing to expend resources to support religious entities . Second , religious groups themselves can be powerful magnets of financial , physical , and intangible resources from members . As one observer noted , on a university campus in Islamabad , three mosques were already established with a fourth on the way without one bookstore established ( Bénabou et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , from “1990s to 2000s , there was sharp growth of Protestant churches in Nigeria , with a corresponding high number of mega churches built all over the country . ” 4 Forbes 2011 referenced “One church near Lagos , for example , that has a capacity for over 50 , 000 people and listed the fortunes of Nigeria’s wealthiest pastors , one with a net worth of over $ 150 million . 5 These are examples of expended resources that may have been used to innovate . Third , religious adherents who are legitimate sources of human capital within the NIS will not be able to fully participate in and contribute to the innovation process if they were fully or partially engaged at religious organizations . Religious belonging will detract from innovative activities by draining human resources away from the NIS . Thus , high levels of religious belonging will hinder 4 Pew Forum . 2011 . “Global Christianity : A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World ' s Christian Population . ” Washington DC : Pew Research Center . https : / / www . pewforum . org / 2011 / 12 / 19 / global - christianity - exec / 5 Nsehe , Mfonobong . 2011 . “The Five Richest Pastors in Nigeria . ” Forbes , Retrieved on June 8 , 2011 , from http : / / www . forbes . com / sites / mfonobongnsehe / 2011 / 06 / 07 / the - five - richest - pastors - in - nigeria / # 1c9480524d6b Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 13 a nation’s ability to efficiently transform innovation inputs into outputs . Consistent with the RBV theory , we hypothesize that : H1a : There will be a negative relationship between innovation capability and religious belonging . H1b : There will be a negative relationship between actual innovation and religious belonging . B . Religious Belief and Innovation Religious belief , which refers to having faith in the existence of the supernatural and their involvement in the physical world , can have real effects on attitudes and behaviors . Religiosity has been shown to be associated with low crime rates , improved physical and mental well - being , and increased social cooperation ( Mochon , D . ; Norton , M . ; Ariely , M . , 2011 ) . Further investigation into these benefits , however , reveals that the benefits only accrued to the religious themselves such that , as faith wanes , the benefits diminishes , resulting in a U shaped relationship between religion and these benefits ( Mochon et al . , 2011 ) . In terms of the national economy , it has been suggested that religious belief has a positive relationship with growth ( Barro and McCleary , 2003 , 2006 ) . A common rationale is that religious beliefs make adherents more ethical ( e . g . not cheating on taxes ) which is good for the economy ( Guiso , Luigi , Paola Sapienza and Luigi Zingales , 2003 ) and Guiso et al . , 2010 ) . However , there is also evidence pointing to a negative relationship between religious belief and innovation . Since innovation is linked to act producing new products and improving the human condition , it tends to rely heavily on the intellectual efforts of the individuals involved . The scientific process , which has Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 14 brought about several technological advancements , is a primary mode of innovation . Science challenges old ways of thinking and clears the way for new and even better ideas to flourish . Scientific thinking is diametrically opposite to religiosity in two principal ways : First , a belief in the supernatural , such as an imponderable creator God from whom believers derive their mandate and sustenance , tend to evoke a need to defend the supernatural beings and their laws , no matter how old the laws and especially when the veracity of the laws are threatened by new and innovative ideas . A conflict between religion and science has persisted since the Middle Ages and is reflected in the words of Ignatius de Loyola , founder of the Jesuit Order : “ To keep ourselves right in all things , we ought to hold fast to the principle : What I see as white I will believe to be black if the hierarchical church thus determines it ” ( Bénabou et al . , 2015 ) . A modern day Christian apologist , Dr . William Craig , wrote , “ Should a conflict arise between the witness of the Holy Spirit to the fundamental truth of the Christian faith and beliefs based on argument and evidence then it is the former which must take precedence over the latter ” ( Craig , 1994 ) . Second , religious belief may cause people to disengage altogether from innovating because people of faith may believe that God will provide solutions to their problems . For example , parents have denied their sick children medicine citing religious beliefs ( Orr , 2003 ) . U . S . politicians have also blocked scientific research ( e . g . stem cell research ) . “They believed contradicted their religious beliefs . ” 6 Religiously motivated politicians have also attempted to rise in opposition of and 6 Vestal , Christine . 2008 . “Stem Cell Research at the Crossroads of Religion and Politics . ” Religion and Public Life . Pew Research Center , Washington , DC .

In highly religious countries ( e . g . Ghana and Nigeria ) , where having faith is considered a virtue , it is not uncommon to find people praying for and believing in miracles when faced with hardships . In Bénabou et al . ’s cross - county study ( 2015 ) , the strong negative relationship between religious beliefs and attitudes towards innovation carried through even after controlling for Gross Product per capita , population , level of tertiary education ( share of population over 25 with a at least a Bachelor’s degree ) , and FDI inflows ( share of Gross Product ) . While a causal inference could not be drawn , they found attitudes toward innovation to be especially low in the “Bible Belt” states of the US and advocated “the need for a formal analysis of the coevolution of science and religiosity” ( Bénabou et al . , 2015 ) . Because some propagators of religion ( e . g . religious leaders and politicians ) may be inclined to proactively discourage the pursuit of scientific knowledge and even support the replacement of such knowledge with non - scientific “supernatural knowledge , ” religious beliefs thus compete against scientific knowledge . Religion tends to resist new ways of thinking , especially when its doctrines are threatened . Moreover , analytic thinking was found to be negatively associated with disbelief in God ( Zuckerman , Silberman , and Hall , 2013 , and Friedman , Boyatzis , and Taylor , 2016 ) . Given that scientific knowledge is corrosive to religious beliefs to the point that the latter is often adapted to remain relevant ( Bénabou et al . , 2015 ) , it is apparent that it is challenging , in some cases , for religion and science to co - exist since the rise in one inadvertently leads to the reduction in the other . Religious beliefs will invariably interact with NISs in a manner that leads to low innovation . Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 16 Thus , high levels of religious beliefs will dampen a nation’s capability to efficiently transform innovation inputs into outputs . Consistent with to the KBV theory , we hypothesize that : H2a : There will be a negative relationship between innovation capability and religious belief . H2b : There will be a negative relationship between actual innovation and religious belief . C . Religious Intolerance and Innovation Studies show that the more religious people are the more racist ( Encyclopedia of Religion , 1998 ) and less open to diversity ( Hall , Matz , and Wood , 2010 ) . However , Florida ( 2008 ) found tolerance to be conducive for creativity – a precursor for the innovation ( Govindarajan and Trimble , 2010 ; Weisberg , 2006 ) , which in turn can positively influence economic growth ( Duesenberry , 1956 ) . Religiosity has been linked to manifestations of intolerance such as authoritarianism , close - mindedness , restrictiveness , divisiveness , intolerance , and racism ( Day 2005 , Zysberg and Schenk 2013 ; Hall et al . 2010 ; Swatos 1998 ) which are not conducive to creativity and innovation . However , instead of painting adherents with a single brush , it is important to make a clear distinction between moderate and extreme beliefs and the influence of such beliefs on innovation . If “religious belief” is what religious moderates identify with , “religious intolerance” is practiced by extremist adherents . Yet , it is interesting to point out that many adherents , including “moderates” sometimes support what is considered extremist Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 17 activities , such as suicide bombing or honor killings , done in the name of a religion . 7 Religious extremists often read and take scriptures literally and deem the words therein as the immutable word of the Creator . They believe that their interpretation of scripture and religion is correct or is the only correct version . In the occasion of intolerance , those who hold extreme positions tend to have been persuaded in their knowledge of world , which is filtered through their religion , and they have little to no motivation to learn new information . Societies with a significant composition of the religious extremists would likely not pursue innovation or the learning that accompanies it , and because learning and knowledge are intertwined , these societies are likely to create an environment that obstruct the type of learning required to develop innovation capabilities . In Nigeria , for example , a religious group whose primary aim is to prevent their communities from learning named themselves , Boko Haram ( meaning Non - Islamic Education is Forbidden ) . In 2014 , the group , kidnapped at least 276 girls from schools to prevent them from learning . 8 Due to the dogmatic nature of their approach , we liken religious intolerance to a calcified form of religious belief . Because of the threat dogma poses to learning and the intolerance to new ideas it promotes , we suspect that high levels of religious intolerance will strongly obstruct a nation’s capability to efficiently transform innovation inputs into outputs . Therefore , consistent with the Learning Theory , we hypothesize that : 7 Pew Global . 2014 . “Muslim Views on Suicide Bombing . ” Retrieved on June 8 , 2018 , from http : / / www . pewglobal . org / 2014 / 07 / 01 / concerns - about - islamic - extremism - on - the - rise - in - middle - east / pg - 2014 - 07 - 01 - islamic - extremism - 10 / 8 1 .

H3b : There will be a negative strong relationship between actual innovation and religious intolerance . VI . Sources of Data and Research Model In order to study the relationship between innovation and religiosity , we drew from two sources of data , the GII and the WVS . GII data is presented at the country level , while each observation in the WVS dataset represented an individual who was surveyed . Thus , we aggregated the WVS to obtain a country - level data . Our main specification is the following cross - sectional model : ( 1 ) Innovation Proxy i = α + β ∙ Religion Proxy i + � γ i , j ∙ Controls i , j j + ε i where Innovation Proxy is a measure of innovation ; i . e . , innovation capability , actual innovation , or related innovation variables . Religion Proxy represents religiosity . We selected control variables as those that should also be influential in the resulting level of innovation in any country . These include the country’s GPD per capita , as well as GII country scores for the rule of law , freedom of the press , political stability , business environment , and enrollment in tertiary education . As already mentioned , the overall GII score was used as a measure of innovation capability , whereas we used GII’s knowledge and technology output scores and creative output scores to measure actual innovation . Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 19 In order to gauge the pervasiveness or intensity of religiosity in a country , we looked at the survey responses from the WVS 9 to the questions : “Are you an active member in Church or other religious organization ? ” , “Apart from weddings and funerals , about how often do you attend religious services these days ? ” , “How important to you is religion ? ” , “Independently of whether you attend religious services or not , would you say you are a religious person ? ” , “Do you believe in God ? ” , “How important is God in your life ? ” , “Do you believe in Hell ? ” , “The only acceptable religion is my religion” , and “Whenever science and religion conflict , religion is always right” .

In addition to studying the innovation capability and actual innovation measures , we were interested in university - industry collaboration ( UIC ) as measures of innovation , because it has been previously used to approximate innovation ( Rantala & Ukko ) . We also studied national patent application ( NPA ) because patents are often used as indicators of innovation , even though using them as such has been criticized . 10 Given a total of five innovation variables and nine religiosity variables , forty - five combinations of regression models were estimated . For brevity , the table shows only the coefficient of the religion variable , that is , the β in E quation ( 1 ) . Regardless , the control variables were the same for each model , and all models were estimated using robust , heteroskedasticity - consistent standard errors . 9 See Appendix 1 for details on how the data for each survey question is aggregated and used in the regression model . 10 Basulto , Dominic . 2015 . “Patents are a Terrible Way to Measure Innovation . ” The Washington Post . July 14 . https : / / www . washingtonpost . com / news / innovations / wp / 2015 / 07 / 14 / patents - are - a - terrible - way - to - measure - innovation / ? noredirect = on & utm _ term = . dd39d2de5a4e ( accessed June 4 , 2019 ) . Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 20 [ INSERT Table 1 here ] Almost every coefficient in Table I is negative and significant , indicating a negative effect of every dimension of religion in the country’s level of innovation . Coefficients that are positive are also not statistically significant . Thus , these results support all the hypotheses . We noted some differences in the coefficients that are negative and significant as well . For example , belief in God and belief in Hell had the most pervasive effect on the innovation measures . They negatively impacted , in a significant manner , all the innovation variables except the knowledge - technology output measure . Religious attendance does not seem to have significant effects on innovation , as only a single coefficient ( that of NPA ) is negative and significant . Except for the NPA measure , the rest of religious attendance results in some ways contradicts previous studies ( Barro and McCleary , 2003 ) that reported a negative correlation between Religion attendance and economic growth . What the results show instead is that attending religious activities ( e . g . going to church ) may not be harmful to innovation . In fact , some have argued that places of religious worship may boost one’s social network ( Lima and Putnamb , 2010 ) , which could be helpful for overall well - being and for making useful professional connections . Active membership , however , was negatively correlated with innovation capability ( GII score ) and NPA , which was consistent with previous studies of ( Benabou et al . 2013 ; 2015 ) . Overall , religious belonging had a negative effect on innovation , but to a lesser extent when compared to religious belief and religious intolerance . Compared to the other two categories , religious belonging had the most deleterious effect on NPA . The coefficient was in the hundreds in the case of religious belonging compared to the tens for belief and intolerance . Comparing the sizes of significant coefficients reveals religious intolerance to have the strongest Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 21 effect on innovation capability ( GII score ) . For example , the beta of “Non - acceptance of other religion” is - 14 . 695 while the corresponding beta of “Religion is important” is only - 8 . 116 . The GII score is composed of several variables , and in order to test the validity of the effects of religiosity on the innovation variables , a Principal Component Analysis on the GII data was performed . The analysis allowed us to control for the possible effects of several other variables that may be influential on the innovation measures . We find that the first four components from the analysis explain most of the country - level variability , after which each additional components explained less than 2 % of it . We then tested the model using these four principal components as control variables for each innovation measure . A representative result for one religious measure ( Religion is Important ) is shown in Table II . [ INSERT Table II here ] Finally , we investigated the effects of a country’s predominant religion on innovation . We thought this was an important step because the world’s religions can have stark differences , including in the ways it is practiced , the nature of worship , nature of participation , and general attitudes towards intellectual knowledge . We considered a country’s main religion as the religion a majority of the survey respondents adhered to in any given country , which is problematic in countries where two or more religions have similar numbers of followers . As a result , we present these findings as an exploratory analysis , to be used in conjunction with the previous results , and not as stand - alone evidence of the relationship between a specific religion and country level innovation . We included a categorical variable that represents each country’s predominant religion such that the coefficients for each religion can be interpreted Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 22 as a differential effect with respect to a country where most people declare that they do not adhere to any religion . For each innovation measure , the model with the first set of controls and the model with the PCA controls were considered . [ INSERT Table III here ] As shown in Table III , all the religions , except the Church of Sweden , appear to be negatively correlated with innovation . The Church of Sweden had a positive effect on all the innovation measures , with significant relationships reported for all measures except NPA . This indicates that the manner in which the religion is practice may be very compatible with innovation . Buddhism had the second highest number of positive relationships with innovation measures ( 3 out of 10 ) , even though none of the positive relationships were significant . VIII . Conclusion This research was motivated by previous a study , which found that attitude toward innovation and religiosity was negatively associated with innovation . We wanted to confirm whether the negative attitudes towards innovation somehow translates into a negative association between religiosity and actual innovation . This research not only addresses the gap , it also contributes to the body of innovation research by using a more robust measure of innovation , the Global Innovation Index , instead of the typical patent measure . Based on previous studies , we hypothesized that religious belonging , religious belief and religious intolerance were negatively associated with measures of innovation capability and actual innovation . Overall , the results presented show that religion was negatively related to both innovation capability and actual innovation . Every country’s major religion , except the Church of Sweden , were also found to be negatively associated with Electronic copy available at : https : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 3451502 23 innovation . The researchers suggest future inquiry into the possible effects of religious policies on national levels of innovation . A similar analysis of religiosity and entrepreneurship is also encouraged .
