Ferreira and Alexis Bonﬁm - Melo are joint ﬁrst co - authors . Among the different infective stages that Trypanosoma cruzi employs to invade cells , extra - cellular amastigotes ( EAs ) have recently gained attention by our group . This is true primarily because these amastigotes are able to infect cultured cells and animals , establishing a sustainable infective cycle . EAs are thus an excellent means of adaptation and survival for T . cruzi , whose different infective stages each utilize unique mechanisms for attachment and penetration . Here we discuss some features of host cell invasion by EAs and the associated host cell signaling events that occur as part of the process . Keywords : extracellular amastigotes , cell invasion , signaling , mevalonate kinase , protein kinase D INTRODUCTION The parasite Trypanosoma cruzi employs a variety of distinct strategies to facilitate invasion of mammalian cells . For instance , multipleinfectivestages [ e . g . , bloodstreamtrypomastigotes , meta - cyclic trypomastigotes , and extracellular amastigotes ( EAs ) ] , vary - ing strains and isolates , as well as differing infectivities have been widelyacknowledgedassigniﬁcantobstaclestoeffectivetreatment . The multitude of invasive strategies employed by T . cruzi repre - sents an important survival advantage for the organism and allows for the remarkably wide range of mammalian hosts affected by this parasite . More speciﬁcally , T . cruzi infects over 100 species from several orders and develops in vivo within a variety of cellu - lar niches , including macrophages , muscle tissue , epithelial cells , ﬁbroblasts , and nerve cells . The ability of T . cruzi to invade , persist and adapt in both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts is multifacto - rial , and depends on both the parasite and host ﬁtness . The cellular communication between parasite and its host is constant and has evolved to be relatively benign , as killing the host would not be advantageous to the parasite . Extracellular amastigotes are either prematurely released from infected cells or generated by the extracellular differentiation of released trypomastigotes ( reviewed in Lima et al . , 2010 ) . During the acute phase of T . cruzi infection within mice , EAs represent 10 % of circulating parasite forms and are capable of sustain - ing an infective cycle in the mammalian host and cells ( Andrews et al . , 1987 ) . Among the EA stage , T . cruzi I strains ( such as the G and Tulahuén strains ) are more infective than T . cruzi II and VI strains ( such as the Y and CL strains ; Fernandes and Mortara , 2004 ; Mortara et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast to trypomastigotes , the recruit - ment of actin is central to the uptake of EA forms in mammalian host cells ( Figure 1 ) , including HeLa cells , the model cell type used in our studies ( Mortara , 1991 ; Procópio et al . , 1998 ; Mortara et al . , 2005 ) . Hereweaimtohighlightaspectsof hostcellinvasionbyEAsand introduce novel ﬁndings including the involvement of molecules from both host cell and the parasite that trigger host cell signaling events . MAMMALIAN CELL INVASION BY EXTRACELLULAR AMASTIGOTES : THE STORY BEGINS Prior to the mid 1980s , chronic infection with T . cruzi was assumed to be sustained by few trypomastigotes in the bloodstream that had escaped the immune response and invaded new cells . The fate of amastigotes at that time was thought to be restricted to the intracellular growth of the parasite . However , pioneering studies ( Behbehani , 1973 ; Nogueira and Cohn , 1976 ; Lanar , 1979 ; Abra - hamsohn et al . , 1983 ; McCabe et al . , 1984 ; Carvalho and de Souza , 1986 ) demonstrated that amastigotes shared some physiological characteristics with trypomastigotes , such as the ability to invade and develop within cells in vitro and the ability to infect mice . For instance , McCabe et al . ( 1984 ) demonstrated that amastigotes www . frontiersin . org November 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 363 | 1 “ﬁmmu - 03 - 00363” — 2012 / 11 / 30 — 19 : 35 — page 2 — # 2 Ferreira etal . T . cruzi : host cell invasion by amastigotes FIGURE 1 | Trypanosoma cruzi G strain amastigotes interact with microvilli on the surface of HeLa cells . Parasites ( colored in red ) imaged by ﬁeld emission - scanning electron microscopy , attach to HeLa cell surface microvilli . Magniﬁcation bar = 5 μ m . isolated from the spleen of mice infected with three different strains of T . cruzi ( Y , MR , and Tulahuén ) were able to infect , survive , and replicate within professional and non - professional ( L929 cell line ) phagocytes . In a different study , Carvalho and de Souza ( 1986 ) obtained highly puriﬁed amastigotes ( Y strain ) fromthemacrophage - likecelllineJ774G8 . Theseamastigoteswere effectively ingested by macrophages and were able to initiate intra - cellular replication . Parasite development in vitro was measured by means of light microscopy . Moreover , puriﬁed amastigotes were highly infective when inoculated into mice , generating high parasitemia and even death ( McCabe et al . , 1984 ; Carvalho and de Souza , 1986 ) . Andrews et al . ( 1987 ) found that amastigotes accounted for 10 % of circulating forms in the blood of mice during the acute phase of infection . Furthermore , this amastigote form was shown to express a speciﬁc surface glycoprotein that was designated Ssp - 4 . These observations were corroborated when Ley et al . ( 1988 ) , by using transmission and scanning electron microscopy , demonstrated that extracellular axenically derived amastigotes ( i . e . , trypomastigote – amastigote differentiation in axenic medium ) were able to multiple within cells in vitro . When injected intraperitoneally , the amastigote forms were as infective to mice as trypomastigotes . Researchers were also able to measure the infectivity and the multiplication rates of the parasites inside cultured cells ( Ley et al . , 1988 ) . The process of trypomastigote – amastigote differentiation in axenic medium can be accelerated by lowering the pH of the medium ( Tomlinson et al . , 1995 ) . EAs can also be obtained from axenic culture media speciﬁcally designed forisolatingamastigotes ( Pan , 1978 ; Rondinelliet al . , 1988 ) . Extra - cellular ( axenically derived ) amastigotes resembled intracellular amastigotes with regard to cell body and kinetoplast morphology , and cell surface expression of Ssp - 4 ( Ley et al . , 1988 ; Barros et al . , 1997 ; Silva et al . , 1998 ) . In vitro , amastigotes are able to infect and complete their life cycle within phagocytic and non - phagocytic host cells , possibly using distinct molecular mechanisms for invasion and escape from the parasitophorous vacuole ( Pan , 1978 ; Carvalho and de Souza , 1986 ; Ley et al . , 1988 ; Mortara , 1991 ; Procópio et al . , 1998 , 1999 ; Andreoli and Mortara , 2003 ; Mortara et al . , 2005 ; Florencio - Martínez et al . , 2010 ; Bambino - Medeiros et al . , 2011 ) . In vivo , EAs were intraperitoneally inoculated into groups of ﬁve A / J mice and all mice were not only infected , but died after 18 – 25 days . Two trypomastigote parasitemia peaks were observed on days 7 and 12 . Signiﬁcantly higher numbers of par - asites were observed during the second peak in mice that were inoculated with Y strain amastigotes ( Ley et al . , 1988 ) . EAs were also resistant to complement - mediated lysis ( Carvalho and de Souza , 1986 ; Iida et al . , 1989 ; Fernandes and Mortara , 2004 ) , a feature thought to be required for infectivity . The general conclu - sion from these studies was that EAs , once prematurely released from dead cells , may persistently infect resident macrophages by initiating an alternative subcycle and / or using an alterna - tive pathway of invasion . It was hypothesized that these events could be crucial for the maintenance of tissue infection and Frontiers in Immunology | Microbial Immunology November 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 363 | 2 “ﬁmmu - 03 - 00363” — 2012 / 11 / 30 — 19 : 35 — page 3 — # 3 Ferreira etal . T . cruzi : host cell invasion by amastigotes inﬂammation ( Scharfstein and Morrot , 1999 ) within the mamma - lian host . In 1991 , the mechanisms by which amastigotes invade non - phagocytic cells began to be determined . Mortara ( 1991 ) observed that amastigotes interact with microvilli on the dorsal surface of HeLa cells leading to microvillus aggregation . This event can be followed by microﬁlament clustering observable by phalloidin staining and ﬂuorescent microscopy . By a combination of ﬂuores - cence and scanning electron microscopy , it was observed that actin aggregates underneath the sites of amastigote adhesion and forms a small clump ( Mortara , 1991 ) that was later called the actin cup - like structure ( Procópio et al . , 1999 ) . Interestingly , cytochalasin D did not signiﬁcantly affect parasite attachment but the disrup - tion of cellular microﬁlaments greatly inhibited amastigote entry ( Mortara , 1991 ; Procópio et al . , 1998 ) . In 1998 , the actin cup - like structures beneath the amastigotes at HeLa cell entry sites were assessed by confocal microscopy ( Procópio et al . , 1998 ) . In that study , gelsolin , an actin - binding protein was overexpressed in NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts . This resulted in a large increase in the internaliza - tion of amastigote forms resulting from enhanced microﬁlament rearrangement . Components of the HeLa cytoskeleton , integrins , and extracellular matrix , such as α - actinin , ABP 280 , gelsolin , α 5 β 5 integrin , laminin , and ﬁbronectin , accumulated along with actin at the sites of EA entry ( Procópio et al . , 1999 ) . EAs MOLECULES OF ADHESION AND SECRETION : INVASION AND SIGNALING Adhesion is a crucial initial step for microorganisms to invade any cell . Association of amastigotes with host macrophages was shown to be mediated by the macrophage mannose receptor ( MR ) and mannose - binding protein ( MBP ; Kahn et al . , 1995 ) . MR and MBP are C - type lectins . MBP strongly and stably binds to amastigotes , and this interaction may contribute to parasite opsonization and cellular invasion . MBP – amastigote interaction is stage speciﬁc , can be inhibited by mannan , and requires calcium ( Kahn et al . , 1996 ) . The amastigote ligands for MBP include SA85 - 1 and other related surface glycoproteins ( Kahn et al . , 1996 ) . IFN - γ down - regulates MR expression and thus inhibits parasite invasion and replication within macrophages . It has recently been reported that in vivo infection by G strain ( TcI ) EAs is inhibited by IFN - γ production ( Rodrigues et al . , 2012 ) . Fibronectin also appears to bridge these initial binding steps ( Tulahuén strain ; Noisin and Villalta , 1989 ; Procópio et al . , 1999 ) . Our group has previously shown that car - bohydrate epitopes expressed on the surface of EAs may also play a roleinparasiteadhesiontoHeLacellssincemonoclonalantibodiesinhibitedtheprocess ( Silva et al . , 2006 ) . Cruz et al . ( 2012 ) demonstrated that the treatment of HeLa cells with recombinant amastin , a surface glycoprotein abundant in amastigotes , reduced the infectivity of EA forms . Conversely , the ectopic T . cruzi expression of amastin accelerated differentia - tion of amastigotes into trypomastigotes . These results positioned amastin as a potential amastigote molecule able to modulate EA invasion and differentiation within mammalian cells . In addi - tion , amastin might participate in speciﬁc host cell signaling culminating in EA invasion . Trypanosoma cruzi EAs may also secrete proteins in order to aid their attachment and entry into HeLa cells . Silva et al . ( 2009 ) identiﬁed a hypothetical protein of 21 kDa with no known orthol - ogous in other species . So - called P21 is secreted by the parasites and enhances amastigote invasion , especially when the recom - binant protein is added to host cells together with parasites as part of HeLa cell invasion assays . Researchers concluded that P21 triggers unknown host cell signaling events that lead to parasite internalization . Moonlightingenzymesorproteinmoonlightingreferstoaphe - nomenon in which a protein can perform more than one function , includingunexpectedfunctions ( Jeffery , 2009 ) . Manyproteinsthat moonlight are enzymes involved in glycolysis , an ancient univer - sal metabolic pathway . It has been suggested that as many as 7 of 10 proteins in glycolysis and 7 of 8 enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle exhibit moonlighting behavior . Our group has recently characterized a moonlighting protein in T . cruzi called meval - onate kinase ( MVK ) , an enzyme involved in isoprenoid synthesis . As part of the T . cruzi infection process , this moonlighting pro - tein is involved both in parasite invasion and host cell signaling ( Ferreira et al . , unpublished ) . There are numerous intermedi - ates in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway that play important roles in the post - translational modiﬁcation of a multitude of pro - teins involved in intracellular signaling . These intermediates in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway are essential regulators of cell growth / differentiation , gene expression , protein glycosylation , and cytoskeletal assembly . Microarray analysis of EA mRNAs has demonstrated that MVK displays higher expression within G ( more infective ) than in CL ( less infective ) parasites , suggesting an important role of the MVK pathway in EA infectivity ( Ferreira et al . , unpublished ) . We have obtained data indicating that MVK may be a modulator in EA invasion and could become an important target in the develop - ment of new drugs to treat Chagas’ disease . Moreover , in T . cruzi , MVK is secreted and likely participates in the modulation of HeLa cell signaling leading to EA cell invasion . These observations reveal new possibilities for the study of moonlighting protein evolution and function within intracellular parasites . EAs AND HOST CELL SIGNALING The ﬁrst experiments to describe signaling events induced by EAs in non - phagocytic cells were performed in 1998 . Procópio et al . ( 1998 ) used a protein kinase C inhibitor , staurosporine , and also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , genistein , to treat HeLa cells before invasion assays with EA . Curiously , staurosporine had no effect whereas genistein moderately inhibited the invasion of EAs in HeLa cells . In Vero cells , genistein had no effect but staurosporine inhibited EA invasion by 82 % . The role of RhoA GTPases in host cell invasion by EAs of both G and CL strains of T . cruzi was subsequently studied . Rho GTPases regulate three separate sig - nal transduction pathways , linking plasma membrane receptors to the assembly of distinct actin ﬁlament structures . Fernandes and Mortara ( 2004 ) used non - polarized MDCK cells transfected with different Rho GTPase constructs ( RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 ) . EA invasion was particularly high in MDCK cells overexpressing either wild type or constitutively active Rac1 . Consistently , EA invasion was speciﬁcally reduced in the corresponding dominant negative line , suggesting a key role for Rac1 - GTPase in the inva - sionprocess ( FernandesandMortara , 2004 ) . Ontheotherhand , in www . frontiersin . org November 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 363 | 3 “ﬁmmu - 03 - 00363” — 2012 / 11 / 30 — 19 : 35 — page 4 — # 4 Ferreira etal . T . cruzi : host cell invasion by amastigotes contrast to a number of bacterial invasion mechanisms ( Mounier et al . , 2003 ) , amastigote invasion seems to be independent of Cdc42 . Sonicated extracts from G or CL strain of EA induced transient enhancement in HeLa cell intracellular Ca 2 + levels in a dose - dependent manner . Inhibition of HeLa cell intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization by thapsigargin or caffeine moderately reduced the infectivity of both G and CL strains ( Fernandes et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , EAs of both strains trigger calcium signaling in HeLa cells that may be important for the success of EA invasion . Adenylyl cyclase based activation of HeLa cells by exposure to forskolin did not affect infection by either strain . The activation of PI3 kinase in host cells appears to be required for invasion by either the G or CL strain since treatment of HeLa cells with wortmannin reduced EA infec - tivity ( Fernandes et al . , 2006 ) . It has also been described that the use of PI3 kinase inhibitors impairs EA ( Y strain ) internalization into peritoneal macrophages by 60 % ( Barrias et al . , 2010 ) . We have recently observed that the treatment of non - phagocytic cells with a Src - family tyrosine kinase ( SFK ) inhibitor , in the absence of serum , reduces EA ( G strain ) invasion ( Bahia et al . , unpublished ) . In addition , EA of the G strain induced time - dependent HeLa cell phosphorylation of SFKs , whose members include Src , Lyn , Fyn , Lck , Yes , and Hck . At this stage , however , the precise Src members involved in this pathway have not been identiﬁed . These results suggest that EAs may also exploit the host cell Src pathway in order to invade cells . EAs AND THE HOST CELL POINT OF VIEW Host cell plasma membrane microdomains were also shown to be involved in EA T . cruzi entry into non - phagocytic cells . Mem - brane microdomains , also known as lipid rafts , play a unique role in signal transduction by compartmentalizing cell receptors and subsequently boosting downstream signaling to the effectors molecules ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . Cholesterol , the major component of membrane lipid rafts of Vero or HeLa cells was dis - rupted by methyl β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) and then infected with EAs of G ( TcI ) and CL ( TcVI ) strains ( Fernandes et al . , 2007 ) . Removal of cholesterol from both host cell lines signiﬁcantly decreased the invasion index of EAs , indicating that host cell cholesterol and / or membrane organization is important for the entry process of both infective forms . After cholesterol repletion , the invasion index of G strain EAs was almost fully recovered . Sub - unit B of cholera toxin binds to the GM1 ganglioside , a marker for lipid rafts , and the treatment of non - phagocytic cells with CTB ( cholera Toxin - B ) also decreased EA invasion . In macrophages , the participation of lipid rafts in the internalization of EAs has also been described ( Barrias et al . , 2007 ) . Barrias et al . ( 2010 ) showed that dynamin , a large GTPase that belongs to a protein superfamily with a critical role in endocytic membrane ﬁssion events , plays a role in EA internalization into peritoneal macrophages . Researchers treated macrophages with dynasore , a reagent that has the ability to block the GTPase activity of dynamin , and observed a marked inhibition in the internaliza - tion of EAs . However , dynasore did not signiﬁcantly interfere with parasite adhesion to host cells . Bambino - Medeiros et al . ( 2011 ) showed that amastigote inva - sion also involves host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans , which localize to signaling membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts . By treating EAs of the Dm28c strain with heparin or heparan sulfate , researchers observed inhibition of EA entry into primary cultures of cardiomyocytes . The authors hypothesized that the binding of amastigote heparin - binding protein could activate dif - ferent signaling pathways , such as phosphorylation of cortactin by Src activation that would lead to actin polymerization and amastigote entry . Along these lines , we are currently evaluating the role of protein kinase D ( PKD ) and cortactin in EA uptake by HeLa cells ( Bonﬁm - Melo , unpublished ) . PKD is a family of multidomain enzymes ( PKD1 , 2 , and 3 ) . PKD lies downstream of PKCs in a novel sig - nal transduction pathway implicated in the regulation of multiple fundamental biological processes . At the leading edge of migrating cells , active PKD co - localizes with F - actin , Arp2 / 3 , and cortactin . Cortactin has emerged as a key signaling protein in cellular pro - cesses such as endocytosis and tumor invasion by interacting with and / or altering the cortical actin network . PKD is an upstream regulator of cortactin . EAs not only recruit PKD ( Figure 2 ) and FIGURE 2 | Extracellular amastigotes ( EAs ) were incubated for 1 h with ( A ) Vero or ( B ) CHO cells transfected with a GFP tagged PKD ( green ) and stained with phalloidin - TRITC ( actin ) and DAPI ( cells nuclei ) .

T . cruzi : host cell invasion by amastigotes FIGURE 3 | Proposed model for EA signaling . EAs secrete factors such as P21 and MVK that aid in EA uptake by cells in culture . EAs also present speciﬁc glycoproteins ( i . e . , Ssp - 4 ) important for attachment and penetration while other EA glycoproteins ( i . e . , amastins - Am ) may negatively modulate amastigote invasion . From the cellular perspective , lipid rafts are essential to parasite internalization in both macrophages and epithelial cells . Furthermore , the mannose receptor of certain cells may recognize mannose residues expressed by EAs which also participate in EA uptake . Upon contact , EAs recruit PKD , actin ( F - actin ) , and other actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) such as cortactin ( Cort ) , gelsolin , and α - actinin . Additionally , EAs likely activate Src - family kinase ( SFK ) , PKC , and Rac1 signaling in host cells . The phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinases ( PI3k ) pathway may also be involved in EA internalization . Cellular heparan sulfate and ﬁbronectin are also important in the process of EA internalization ( extracellular matrix components – ECMs ) .

These results suggest that unexpected novel roads may also be utilized by T . cruzi to invade cells . In order to summarize , the putative cellular molecules and signaling pathways used by EAs are presented in Figure 3 . CONCLUDING REMARKS Extracellular amastigotes of T . cruzi are an infective parasite stage that mobilizes molecules and pathways distinct from those engaged by the classical infective trypomastigote forms . This repertoire of molecules may include not only previously character - ized carbohydrate epitopes and the P21 secreted component , but also novel components described here such as the secreted form of MVK and the cortactin – PKD pathway .
