We have shown recently that in response to a transient stretch the adherent eukaryotic cell promptly fluidizes and then gradually resolidifies , but mechanism is not yet understood . Principal Findings : In the isolated human bladder smooth muscle cell , here we applied a 10 % transient stretch while measuring cell traction forces , elastic modulus , F - actin imaging and the F - actin / G - actin ratio . Immediately after a transient stretch , F - actin levels and cell stiffness were lower by about 50 % , and traction forces were lower by about 70 % , both indicative of prompt fluidization . Within 5min , F - actin levels recovered completely , cell stiffness recovered by about 90 % , and traction forces recovered by about 60 % , all indicative of resolidification . The extent of the fluidization response was uninfluenced by a variety of signaling inhibitors , and , surprisingly , was localized to the unstretch phase of the stretch - unstretch maneuver in a manner suggestive of cytoskeletal catch bonds . When we applied an ‘‘unstretch - restretch’’ ( transient compression ) , rather than a ‘‘stretch - unstretch’’ ( transient stretch ) , the cell did not fluidize and the actin network did not depolymerize . Conclusions : Taken together , these results implicate extremely rapid actin disassembly in the fluidization response , and slow actin reassembly in the resolidification response . In the bladder smooth muscle cell , the fluidization response to transient stretch occurs not through signaling pathways , but rather through release of increased tensile forces that drive acute disassociation of actin .

Introduction Cells in vivo are routinely subjected to mechanical stimuli that markedly influence their structure and function [ 1 – 5 ] . We have shown recently that in response to a transient stretch - unstretch maneuver , cells across a wide range of physiological systems including airway , kidney , and blood vessels , respond by promptly ablating their stiffness and cell traction forces , while transiently increasing their loss tangent [ 6 , 7 ] . Taken together , these mechanical responses demon - strate that the cell acutely fluidizes [ 7 ] . These measurements also show that this fluidization response is prompt , and mediated by the effects of physical forces acting directly upon a material – the cytoskeleton – that is innately fragile [ 8 – 11 ] . However , the mechanism accounting for the fluidization phenomenon remains unclear . The primary goal of this study is to investigate in the human bladder smooth muscle ( HBSM ) cell the structural and molecular level changes that underlie the fluidization response . We used imaging and molecular probes to measure dynamics of F - actin polymerization , we used Cell Mapping Rheometry ( CMR ) [ 6 ] to measure cell traction force dynamics , and we used Optical Magnetic Twisting Cytometry ( OMTC ) [ 12 ] to measure cell stiffness dynamics . To investigate specificity of the fluidization response , we pretreated HBSM cells with a panel of signaling inhibitors whose effects on bladder smooth muscle cell physiology are well known [ 13 – 15 ] . Finally , we applied to the cell instead of a transient stretch maneuver ( i . e . stretch - unstretch ) , a transient compression maneuver ( i . e . unstretch - restretch ) . Although it has been shown previously that transient stretch - unstretch fluidizes the cytoskeleton ( CSK ) , these prompt mechan - ical effects have been attributed entirely to the disruption of actin - myosin crosslinks and other weak stress - bearing bonds [ 6 , 7 , 16 – 21 ] . Depolymerization of F - actin filaments in response to stretch has also been known for a long time [ 22 ] , but based upon existing data , that depolymerization process was thought to be too slow to account for prompt CSK fluidization . Here for the first time we unify these structural and mechanical changes . PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e12035 Results Changes of traction force The traction force is the net force per unit area transmitted from the adherent cell to the substrate , and must be balanced by the internal stress ( prestress ) in the cell body [ 23 ] . After completion of a transient stretch - unstretch maneuver of 4 s duration , there was a dramatic and prompt decrease in the traction forces ( Figure 1B ) . Within 5 min , the traction forces gradually recovered ( Figure 1C ) to prestretch levels ( Figure 1A ) . The traction force dynamics were even clearer when we quantified them through the contractile moment [ 24 ] : at the earliest measurable time point following stretch , the contractile moment was reduced by 70 % of its baseline value . This was followed by a gradual recovery ( Figure 1D ) . Changes of cell stiffness Stiffness after transient stretch - unstretch relative to stiffness of the same cells immediately before was denoted normalized G ’ ( G 0 n ) . Using this normalized cell stiffness , we could use each cell as its own control . When no stretch was applied , this fractional stiffness did not change , but after cessation of a single transient stretch G 0 n promptly decreased and then slowly recovered ( Figure 2 ) . G 0 n decreased to , 50 % of pre - stretch value at 5 s after stretch and returned to baseline values in 5 min ( Figure 2 Untreated ) . Next , we tested the effects of cell signaling inhibitors that are known to play a significant role in HBSM cell mechanotransduction during a prolonged stretch and hold maneuver [ 13 – 15 ] . Contrary to their demonstrated effects during stretch and hold , these inhibitors were found to have negligible effects on cell mechanical responses following a single transient stretch - unstretch maneuver ( Figure 2 ) . When we measured HBSM cell responses following a 10 % transient compression rather than a 10 % transient stretch , G 0 n did not change ( Figure 2 Compression ) . F - actin staining and levels of F - actin / G - actin Figure 3 illustrates the representative effects of a single 10 % stretch - unstretch on F - actin filaments . Compared to F - actin filaments in unstretched cells within the same dish but outside the stretched region ( Figure 3A ) , there was clear evidence of disruption of F - actin filaments immediately following stretch ( Figure 3C ) . Five minutes after stretch , F - actin filaments levels recovered ( Figure 3D ) and were indistinguishable from those in Figure 1 .

Quantitative image analysis supported this observation ( Figure 3E , F ) . To further confirm these effects , we measured the phosphotyrosine protein phosphorylation profile and levels of filamentous ( F ) and globular ( G ) actin in HBSM cells subjected to transient stretch ; over the short duration of the experimental maneuver , the total amount of actin must be conserved . The profile of phosphotyrosine protein phosphorylation did not change appreciably ( Figure 4A ) , but there was a complete ablation of F - actin levels immediately after stretch , and slow recovery to pre - stretch levels in 5 minutes ( Figure 4B ) . The trajectory of traction recovery ( 30 % – 60 % , Figure 1D ) differed from that of stiffness ( 50 % – 90 % , Figure 2 Untreated ) and F - actin intensity recovery ( 50 % – 100 % , Figure 3E , F ) , but these differences are likely attributable to slight differences in experimental protocols ; tractions were measured in single isolated cells whereas OMTC and F - actin measurements were performed in confluent cell layers . Discussion Dynamic changes in stiffness and traction forces in HBSM cells are consistent with our previous findings in human airway smooth muscle ( HASM ) cells and other adherent cell types [ 6 , 7 ] . Because stretch - induced fluidization is virtually instantaneous , it would appear not to be mediated by signaling events , but rather to represent the immediate response of a fragile material to application of physical forces . Indeed , when we disrupted PI3K , Akt , Rho - kinase and MEK pathways , all of which are known to play key roles in the HBSM response to a prolonged stretch , there were no noticeable effects on the fluidization - resolidification response . We also found that transient stretch did not alter protein tyrosine phosphorylation profile ( Figure 4A ) . In our previous study , when HASM cells were pretreated with pheny - larsine oxide ( PAO ) , which inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation , the recovery of traction forces following a transient stretch was largely ablated [ 6 ] . But in addition to its ability to inhibit tyrosine phosphatase activity , PAO also decreases cellular ATP content , and as such we cannot rule out the possibility that our previous results reflected the effect of ATP depletion , not phosphatase inhibition on recovery of traction forces . Indeed , we have shown previously that ATP depletion causes stiffness recovery to slow considerably [ 7 ] . Taken together , these results suggest that the extent of sudden fluidization depends primarily on the physical property of the fragile material , whereas the resolidification response is dependent upon ATP - driven events . Like the mechanical changes ( Figures 1 and 2 ) , western blotting and actin staining showed that structural changes were prompt . The transient stretch - unstretch maneuver induced prompt disas - sembly followed by slow reassembly of F - actin filaments . These findings are consistent with those of Pender and McCulloch , who reported that F - actin in gingival fibroblasts is reduced by 50 % at 10 s after stretch but increases more than 100 % at 50 s after stretch [ 22 ] . Costa et al also found in human aortic endothelial cells there is rapid remodeling of stress fibers after mechanical perturbation [ 25 ] . Finally , we found that a transient stretch - unstretch maneuver caused cell fluidization whereas a transient compression - decom - pression of the same amplitude and timing did not ( Figure 2 Compression ) . No changes in cell shape or the direction of cell alignment were observed , as has been reported for cells exposed to repetitive cycles of pure uniaxial compression [ 26 ] . Moreover , when cells are subjected to a stretch and hold maneuver , the traction forces and CSK stiffness become elevated and largely sustained , although followed by stress relaxation processes that are quite slow [ 7 , 16 ] . Together , these findings suggest that the prompt destabilization of actin filaments and loss of traction forces are therefore localized to the unstretch phase of the stretch - unstretch manueuver , as if catch bonds [ 27 ] increasingly stabilize the CSK during the loading ( stretch ) phase , but upon unloading promptly release . Catch - like behavior of adhesion molecules and cell Figure 2 . Stiffness dynamics in HBSM cells subjected to a transient stretch or a transient compression . In response to a transient tensile stretch , the elastic modulus G’ dropped acutely to 50 – 60 % of its prestretch value , then recovered slowly . The rate and the extent of this fluidization - resolidification is unaffected by the addition of LY294002 , Triciribine , SB2035580 , PD098059 , Y27632 , or Latrunculin - A ( p & 0 . 05 , Kruskal - Wallis one - way analysis ) . When we applied to the cell a transient compression instead of a transient stretch , G’ was unchanged . All results are reported as median + SE ( n = 244 – 709 beads ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0012035 . g002 Stretch and Actin Disassembly PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e12035 anchorage is well - established [ 27 ] , but to our knowledge catch - like behavior of stress - bearing molecules within the CSK itself has never before been suggested . Importantly , catch - like behavior would also help to account for the unexplained but well - established observation that the CSK loss tangent ( hysteresivity ) systematically decreases as CSK tension increases [ 28 , 29 ] , indicating that the CSK becomes systematically more solid - like . While molecular mechanism remains unclear , actin depolymer - ization responses we report here are certainly dissimilar from the fluidization responses observed in reconstituted actin - myosin networks , which are attributed to disruption of myosin crosslinks [ 17 , 30 , 31 ] . Similarly , we have reported that the perturbation of myosin crosslinks by stretch is a major factor in the fluidization of isolated airway smooth muscle cells and integrated tissues [ 32 , 33 ] . However , disruption of myosin crosslinks alone fails to explain the underlying cytoskeletal plasticity [ 18 , 34 ] , its scale - free rheology [ 12 , 35 ] or its universality in living cells [ 7 ] . Neither can myosin dynamics alone account for our previously reported differences between fluidization versus reinforcement observed in response to a homogenous versus an inhomogeneous stretch [ 6 ] , or account for our current findings of rapid F - actin disassociation followed by a gradual recovery ( Figure 3 and 4 ) . As such , we conclude that fluidization is caused not just by agitation or by relative motion , but rather by increased tensile forces that , upon sufficient loading , or perhaps upon release of that loading , can lead to dissociation of weak bonds or drive disassociation of actin with binding partners such as a - actinin or VASP , whose recruitment is facilitated by the force - dependent action of zyxin [ 36 – 38 ] . In that connection , zyxin is a logical candidate to account for the slow resolidification that is observed after unstretch , but could zyxin account for prompt fluidization during stretch ? Increasing cytoskeletal tension causes the rate constant for zyxin dissociation ( the off - rate ) from focal adhesions to decrease [ 37 ] and mobilization of zyxin to stress fibers [ 38 ] . As such , during the ‘‘stretch’’ phase of the transient maneuver studied here , zyxin could not account for fluidization and , if anything , would act to reinforce stress fibers . On the other hand , during the unstretch phase of the transient maneuver , traction forces fall rapidly to zero [ 6 ] . Whether zyxin , during that low - tension phase , might demobilize from stress fibers sufficiently to account for actin disassembly is unclear and warrants investigation . Another plausible candidate is the actin severing protein , cofilin [ 39 – 41 ] . In its dephosphorylated form , cofilin binds and remodels actin filaments , increases its torsional and bending flexibility , and significantly lowers filament persistence length [ 42 – 44 ] . Taken together , these effects promote bending and disassociation of in vitro actin networks . How these effects mediate dynamics of stretch responses in intact cells remains unknown . In summary , through cytoskeletal imaging and molecular probes we have elucidated a major role for F - actin dynamics in Figure 3 . A major component of fluidization is F - actin disassembly : staining results . Within each well , F - actin levels in stretched HBSM cells ( inside the indenter footprint ) were compared to those in unstretched cells ( outside the indenter footprint ) . ( A ) , ( C ) , F - actin filaments rapidly dissociated immediately after stretch . ( B ) , ( D ) , the F - actin levels recovered to baseline 300 seconds after stretch . ( E ) , ( F ) , from those images , we quantified intensities . Within each dish , we normalized average F - actin intensities in stretched cells to those in unstretched cells ( 6 dishes in total for each condition ) and pooled the values together . Average F - actin intensity in stretched cells was 50 % lower than that in unstretched cells immediately after stretch ( Figure 3E ; p , 0 . 05 , two - tailed unpaired Student’s t - test ) , but recovered to prestretched values 300s after stretch ( Figure 3F ) . Data are reported as mean + SE ( n = 14 – 29 cells ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0012035 . g003 Stretch and Actin Disassembly PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 August 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 8 | e12035 the acute fluidization - resolidification response , and discovered that prompt changes are mediated not through signaling pathways but are brought about by the direct action of tensile forces exerted on a fragile cell . For reasons that remain unclear , the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton is extremely rapid , and is localized to the unstretch phase of the maneuver . Materials and Methods Cell culture and pharmacological interventions HBSM cells were isolated and propagated as previously described [ 45 ] . Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , penicillin ( 100 U / ml ) and streptomycin ( 100 m g / ml ) , and were placed in a humidified incubator at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells between passage 3 – 7 were used for all experiments , and they were serum deprived for 24 h before being tested . For the traction force measurement , cells were seeded sparsely ( , 2 , 000 cells / well ) on type I collagen coated polyacrylamide gel substrates 4 h before experiment ; for the OMTC measurements and actin staining , cells were seeded at , 200 , 000 cells / well on gel substrates 24 h before experiment ; for western blotting , cells were seeded at , 200 , 000 cells / well in a 6 - well plate on deformable membranes ( type I collagen coated ; Flexcell International Corporation ) . The follow - ing pharmacological interventions were used : LY294002 ( inhibits the PI3K , 10 m M ) , Triciribine ( specifically inhibits the Akt / PKB , 10 m M ) , SB203580 ( inhibits p38 MAP kinase pathway , 10 m M ) , PD098059 ( inhibits the MEK , 30 m M ) , Y27632 ( inhibits Rho / Rho - kinase pathway , 10 m M ) and Latrunculin - A ( inhibits actin polymerization and disrupts microfilament organization ) . The incubation time for all inhibitors was 20 min . Preparation of polyacrylamide substrates Polyacrylamide gel substrates were prepared according to previous protocols [ 46 – 48 ] . The gels were made within 35 mm dishes ( glass bottom , uncoated , P35 - G - 020 - C ; MaTek ) . The diameter and the depth of the gel substrates were 20 mm and 700 m m respectively . We adjusted the ratio between 40 % acrylamide ( Bio - Rad Laboratory ) and 2 % bis - acrylamide ( Bio - Rad Laboratory ) to produce the gel substrates with Young’s modulus at 4 kPa because HBSM cells showed optimal prolifer - ation rate on 4 kPa substrates ( data not shown ) . After gel polymerization , the substrates were coated with 1 . 5 ml of type I collagen solution ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ; Inamed Biomaterial ) and stored overnight at 4 u C . On the next day , the gels were washed with phosphate buffered saline , hydrated with 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 0 . 5 % FBS and stored in incubator at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 . Stretch apparatus We used a custom - built stretch setup [ 6 ] . A biaxial stretch was imposed by lowering a hollow circular punch indenter onto an elastic polyacrylamide gel . In response , cells within the indenter footprint were subjected to a uniform biaxial stretch . The stretch indenter was mounted on the objective of the microscope , coaxial to the objective lens . It was then lowered manually onto the underlying substrate by a pre - calibrated amount . To impose a 10 % transient stretch , an indentation of 400 m m was imposed for 4 seconds . For transient tensile stretch ( stretch - unstretch ) , we used a circular indenter with an inside diameter of 2 mm and an outside diameter of 3 mm ; for transient compressive stretch ( unstretch - restretch ) , we used a circular indenter with an inside diameter of 6 mm and an outside diameter of 7 mm [ 6 ] . Traction force microscopy Phase contrast images of the single HBSM cell and fluorescent images of microbeads embedded within the substrate were taken at different time points during the no - load baseline period , before the onset of the stretch , after stretch cessation and following cell detachment at the end of experiment . We used Fourier transform traction cytometry [ 24 ] to compute the cell traction forces . From the traction map , we obtained the net contractile moment , which is a scalar measure of the cell’s net contractile strength . Nine single cells in 9 wells were used to repeat the traction force measurement . Optical magnetic twisting cytometry The details of the OMTC technique are described elsewhere [ 12 , 35 ] . First , we added the RGD - coated beads onto cells seeded on the gel substrates and waited for 20 min to allow the beads to bind to receptors on the cell surface . Next , we added inhibitors at the stated concentrations into each dish and waited for an additional 20 min . Soon after , we mounted the dish onto a microscope stage custom fitted with the bead twisting setup . The beads were magnetized horizontally and then twisted in an oscillatory magnetic field with a frequency of 0 . 75 Hz . From the ratio of the applied mechanical torque to the measured lateral bead displacement , we calculated the complex elastic modulus which is given by G (cid:2) ~ G ’ z jG ’’ , where G ’ is the elastic modulus , or cell stiffness , which has units of Pascal per nanometer , G ’’ is the loss modulus which has units of Pascal per nanometer , and j is the Figure 4 .

Positive control : PDGF and HB - EGF treatment for 5 minutes . ( B ) In contrast , a transient stretch acutely ablated F - actin levels at short times ( S’0 – immediately after stretch ) . These levels recovered to baseline at longer times ( S’2 . 5 – 2 . 5 minutes after stretch ; S’5 – 5 minutes after stretch ) .

We measured G ’ in 3 – 6 wells for each experimental condition . Data were reported as medians of the bead populations ( 244 – 709 beads on a hundreds of cells per experimental condition ) . Fluorescence staining of F - actin Cells cultured on polyacrylamide gel dishes were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS ( for 10 min ) at 1 s , 2 . 5 min or 5min after stretch . Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min . F - actin filaments were then stained with Oregon Green 488 phalloidin ( diluted 1 : 40 in PBS ; Molecular Probes ) . The stained cells were visualized with a 40 6 oil immersion lens equipped on the Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope . Images were acquired and analyzed using the MetaVue software ( Universal Imaging Corporation ) . Western blotting HBSM cells were seeded on Flexcell plates with deformable membranes coated with type I collagen and subjected to 10 % transient stretch of 4 s duration . Cells were harvested at 1 s , 2 . 5 min and 5 min after stretch cessation . Two wells were pooled for each condition . A non - stretch condition was also included as the negative control group . For phosphor - tyrosine blots , equal amounts of protein lysates from each condition were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with 4G10 anti - phosphotyrosine antibody ( Upstate / Millipore , cat # 05 - 321 ) . For actin blots , equal volumes of the G - actin and F - actin fractions from each treatment condition were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with an actin antibody ( Cytoskeleton , cat # AAN01 ) .
