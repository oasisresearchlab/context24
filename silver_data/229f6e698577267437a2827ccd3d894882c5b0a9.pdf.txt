The C19 . CHILD Hamburg ( COVID - 19 Child Health Investigation of Latent Disease ) Study is a prospective cohort study designed to identify and follow up children and their household contacts infected in the early 2020 first wave of SARS - CoV - 2 . We screened 6113 children < 18 years by nasopharyngeal swab - PCR in a low - incidence setting after general lockdown , from May 11 to June 30 , 2020 . 4657 participants underwent antibody testing . Positive tests were followed up by repeated PCR and serological testing of all household contacts over 6 months . In total , the study identified 67 seropositive children ( 1 . 44 % ) , the median time after infection at first presentation was 83 days post - symptom onset ( PSO ) . Follow up of household contacts showed incomplete seroconversion in most families , with higher seroconversion rates in families with adult index cases compared to pediatric index cases ( OR : 1 . 79 , P = 0 . 047 ) . Most importantly , children showed sustained seroconversion up to nine months PSO , and serum antibody concentrations persistently surpassed adult levels ( ratio serum IgG Spike children vs . adults 90 days PSO : 1 . 75 , P < 0 . 001 , 180 days : 1 . 38 , P = 0 . 01 , 270 days : 1 . 54 , P = 0 . 001 ) . In a low - incidence setting , SARS - CoV - 2 infection and humoral immune response present distinct patterns in children including higher antibody levels , and lower seroconversion rates in families with pediatric index cases . Children show long - term SARS - CoV - 2 antibody responses . These findings are relevant to novel variants with increased disease burden in children , as well as for the planning of age - appropriate vaccination strategies . All rights reserved .

Severe disease due to acute COVID - 19 is rare in children and teenagers [ 2 – 4 ] , and the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome ( PIMS , also termed MIS - C ) attributable to SARS - CoV - 2 only occurs in a small minority of cases [ 5 , 6 ] . Vaccination of adults and teenagers is now widespread even though vaccination rates show large regional differences [ 1 ] . Vaccination of younger children above the age of 5 years [ 7 ] has been ongoing for several months ( US ) to several weeks ( Europe ) and even longer in China at the time of this report . Emerging viral variants , especially the most recent omicron variant ( B . 1 . 1 . 52 ) appear to escape neutralizing antibodies provided by vaccination [ 8 ] . Furthermore , the pediatric population may be at increased risk , because initial reports of the omicron variant suggest an increased hospitalization rate in children compared to earlier variants [ 9 ] . Despite the pressing need to better understand long - term antibody responses in children , longitudinal studies over longer periods after natural infection are almost completely lacking in this age group . Here , we present a prospective cohort study of 67 convalescent children and their household contacts including a quantitative follow up of antibody responses in household clusters up to nine months after symptomatic infection . The children were recruited in the C19 . CHILD Hamburg Study ( COVID - 19 Child Health Investigation of Latent Disease ) , in which over six thousand children under 18 years of age were screened for acute SARS - CoV - 2 infection by PCR and 4657 serological tests were performed . The recruitment to the study followed a general lockdown after the initial wave of ancestral SARS - CoV - 2 infection in 2020 . Methods Study population and ethical approval We conducted an observational prospective multi - center cohort study of children under eighteen years of age in all five pediatric hospitals of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg , Germany ; AKK Altonaer Kinderkrankenhaus , Helios Mariahilf Kinderklinik , Klinik für Kinder - und Jugendmedizin der Asklepios Klinik Nord - Heidberg , Katholisches Kinderkrankenhaus Wilhelmstift , and Werner und Michael Otto Universitätskinderklinik at the University Medical Center Hamburg - Eppendorf ( Kinder - UKE ) from May 11 until June 30 , 2020 .

CHILD Study Clinic at Kinder - UKE . Filling out of a standardized questionnaire , as well as taking a nasopharyngeal swab for the PCR detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA were obligatory for all participants during the screening phase , whereas a venous blood draw for the detection of antibodies directed against SARS - CoV - 2 was optional . Recruitment and consent procedures were equivalent in all participating hospitals . A written informed consent was obtained for each participating subject ( Supplementary Methods ) . The study was approved by the local ethical committee of Hamburg ( reference number : PV7336 ) and published at clinicaltrials . gov ( NCT04534608 ) . Children with a positive PCR and / or antibody test , as well as their household contacts ( referred to as family members ) , were invited to three follow - up appointments . The follow ups were carried out at the earliest possible timepoint within days of screening , then at three - and six months after screening at the C19 . CHILD Study Clinic . Here , an extended questionnaire including a detailed history of infection was completed , and nasopharyngeal swabs and venous blood samples were collected from all family members willing to participate for SARS - CoV - 2 viral RNA and antibody testing . Sample processing and viral RNA detection Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using a Tecan Freedom Evo liquid handler system ( Tecan ) and the NucleoSpin 96 Virus Core Kit ( Macherey - Nagel ; refer to Supplementary Methods for details ) . For the detection of the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA the RealStar SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR Kit 1 . 0 ( Altona Diagnostics ) was used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . The dual target assay detects the viral E - gene ( B - β CoV specific ) and S - gene ( SARS - CoV - 2 specific ) . Samples with positivity in both gene targets were considered positive . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA detection of the follow - up participants was performed using the ECDC recommended E - gene assay [ 10 ] adapted for high - throughput PCR ( Cobas 6800 , Roche ) , as described by S . Pfefferle et al . [ 11 ] . Antibody measurements SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies ( IgA / IgM / IgG ) against the viral nucleocapsid protein were detected in sample serum using the Elecsys® Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ig assay ( Roche ) on the cobas e411 system ( Roche ) . Positive results were confirmed in the same serum sample with the LIAISON® SARS - CoV - 2 IgG serology test ( DiaSorin ) . This alternative assay allows for quantification of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( IgG ) against the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein .

Following the guidelines of the CDC for a low prevalence setting ( < 5 % ) [ 12 ] , an orthogonal testing algorithm was used , therefore samples were only considered seropositive if positive results were obtained with both assays . Statistical Analysis Frequency of demographic and clinical features were reported for study subjects stratified according to SARS - CoV - 2 test results or age groups . Age is shown as mean ± standard deviation , and categorical variables as counts and / or percentages . The primary aim was to estimate the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in children and the sample size was justified in this respect . Since only one child was acutely infected , this primary question cannot be answered . Therefore , all analyses are secondary and explorative . Accordingly , the P - values are not adjusted for multiplicity and are only reported as descriptive measures . Children from the same family were included in the study . This creates a cluster structure that must be adequately considered in the statistical methodology . We therefore used mixed logistic models with the family as random intercept , where appropriate . Another issue is the low number of events , which can lead to separation problems and thus instable estimates . We addressed this by using penalized models provided in the R package GLMMadaptive . For the longitudinal analysis of serum antibody concentrations , a generalized linear mixed model was used with random effects for individuals nested within families . The tweedie distribution , which is implemented in the R package glmmTMB , was chosen in this model to account for measurements below the detection limit and additionally , a zero - inflation was allowed to reflect negative test results . The results were robust with respect to the link function , which was verified in sensitivity analyses . Analyses were performed using R software ( version 4 . 0 . 2 ) and GraphPad Prism ( version 8 . 4 ) . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

CHILD study . Children were recruited regardless of the presence or absence of any COVID - 19 symptoms . The study included 3145 ( 53 % ) volunteers recruited through the C19 . CHILD Study Clinic at Kinder - UKE and 2763 ( 47 % ) subjects who presented at one of the Hamburg pediatric hospitals for reasons independent of this study . In case of a positive PCR and / or antibody test , children were invited for follow - up tests along with all contact persons living in the same household . One child tested PCR positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Two antibody tests were used for this study . For analysis , the Roche nucleocapsid protein total IgA / IgM / IgG test was defined as screening antibody test ( available for 4657 participants , 79 % of total included ) and the DiaSorin S1 / S2 spike IgG was defined as confirmatory test . A total of 67 children , 1 . 44 % of all tested , had a positive antibody reaction in both antibody tests . Participants were recalled for a second testing shortly after positive antibody screening , typically within six days ( mean 5 . 8 ) . Recall testing was available for 50 children , all tests remained positive as determined by both methods ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . In this cohort , the likelihood of seroconversion to SARS - CoV - 2 increased with age , the mean age of seropositive children was two years higher than that of seronegative children ( 10 . 3 vs . 8 . 3 years , P = 0 . 001 , Table 1 ) . We observed a continuous age effect , where the probability of seroconversion increased with an odds ratio of 1 . 11 per year of age ( 95 % CI : 1 . 03 - 1 . 21 , P = 0 . 009 Supplementary Figure 1 ) in the cohort of screened children under eighteen years . Inclusion of more than one child per family created a cluster structure , which we considered by applying mixed logistic regression models . All rights reserved .

Children and adolescents recruited in the participating hospitals often suffered from a complex chronic disease ( 29 % indicated an underlying medical condition , detailed in Supplementary Table S1 ) . One might expect a high proportion of vulnerable individuals in the C19 . CHILD study population regarding infection rates or severity of disease [ 13 ] . However , children with an underlying medical condition representing almost one third of the study cohort did not show a difference in the seroconversion rate ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table S1 ) . When comparing self - reported , age - appropriate vaccinations with seroconversion status , children with a complete vaccination status were more likely to be seropositive than children with missed vaccinations ( Table 1 , 98 . 5 vs . 92 . 3 % , P = 0 . 060 ) . Participants and their guardians were asked to report on any persistent symptoms associated with COVID - 19 in the last 14 days before screening . Notably , the only symptom that was more common in seropositive children was loss of taste ( seronegatives 15 / 4590 , 1 . 3 % , seropositives 3 / 67 , 21 . 4 % , p = 0 . 001 ) . We further looked at the effect of self - reported exposure to persons with confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection on seroconversion rates . Exposure was reported for 119 children from whom antibody tests were also available . Twenty - seven of these children had a confirmed positive screening antibody test ( 22 . 7 % ) and 20 were available for recall testing , all of whom tested positive for both nucleocapsid IgA / IgG / IgM and spike IgG . Children aged 12 - < 18 years ( seroconversion 48 . 1 % , OR : 3 . 2 , 95 % CI : 0 . 5 - 18 . 9 ) as well children aged 6 - < 12 years ( seroconversion 40 . 7 % , OR : 1 . 1 , 95 % CI : 0 . 2 - 5 . 6 ) had a higher probability of seroconversion than children aged 0 - < 6 years ( seroconversion 11 . 1 % , OR : 1 ) after contact to SARS - CoV - 2 . Furthermore , seroconversion was more likely to happen if the contact had been within the family ( 92 . 6 % of seropositives after contact , OR : 20 . 9 , 95 % , CI : 3 . 0 - 143 . 8 ) , than if contacts had been outside the family ( 7 . 4 % of seropositives after contact , OR : 1 , Table 2 ) .

We recalled 43 families for an initial follow - up visit within days after screening ( median 83 days post symptom onset , range 21 - 121 days ) . Seroconversion within families was only complete in a minority of cases ( Figure 1 A , Supplementary Table S2 ) , where seropositivity was again defined based on a positive result for both nucleocapsid IgA / IgG / IgM and spike IgG . Thirty - eight families were able to identify the first infected person in the household ( index case ) based on the beginning of symptoms based on a known contact to an infected person . Notably , when comparing seroconversion rates within individual families , we found that they were lower when the index case was younger than eighteen years than for adult index cases ( mean seroconversion rate 48 . 9 % vs . 73 . 8 % , Figure 1 B ) . Applying logistic regression to model the risk of seroconversion with the type of index case as predictor confirmed these findings ( OR : 1 . 79 , 95 % CI : 1 . 01 - 3 . 19 , P = 0 . 047 ) .

( A ) Seroconversion rate of the families recalled for follow up . The seroconversion rate , calculated by the seropositive household contacts divided by all household contacts , is shown on the x - axis . Families are depicted by their respective ID and arranged by seroconversion rate from top to bottom . Families are colored according to the age group of the respective index case ( child < 18 years or adult > 18 years ) , where applicable . Five families were not able to recall the index case . For two families ( ID : 29 , 73 ) at least one family member refused blood draw . ( B ) Seroconversion rate of families by age group of the index case . Families with an adult index case had a higher seroconversion rate compared to families with a pediatric index case ( mean seroconversion rate 73·8 % vs . 48·9 % ) . To model the risk of seroconversion with the type of index case a logistic regression model was applied . Results are shown in the lower panel ( odds ratio : 1·79 , 95 % CI : 1·01 - 3·9 , P = 0·047 ) . The follow - up phase of this study included further recall appointments for the 43 recall families , at three months and six months after screening ( median 173 days , range 112 - 243 days and median 254 days , range 193 - 279 days post symptom onset , PSO ) . Here , PCR and serologic tests were repeated for family members . Eleven families have been lost to follow up by the end of the study , and in some cases , not all family members were present at every appointment . Four families were excluded on account of no data available on the date of symptom onset . Despite a steep rise in incidence in Hamburg , Germany in November - December 2020 , no acute infection could be detected in any of the study participants by PCR . Longitudinal analysis of antibodies showed that almost all children and adults wo were seropositive at the time of the first follow up retained detectable SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies at the time of the third follow up six months later ( > 193 days after symptom onset ) . This was observed for both types of antibodies measured in this study , All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The spike IgG test allowed for quantitative assessment of serum antibody concentrations . To follow changes in antibody levels of anti - spike IgG over time , statistical modelling using the zero - inflated tweedie - mixed model was applied ( Figure 2 ) . Time points at 90 days , 180 days and 270 days PSO were chosen for comparison between adults and children , matching the observed time frame in the study cohort ( Figure 2 ) . At all of these time points , children had a higher antibody concentration than adult family members ( ratio children vs . adults 90 days PSO : 1 . 75 , 95 % CI 1 . 40 - 2 . 20 , P < 0 . 001 , 180 days PSO : 1 . 38 , 95 % CI 1 . 08 - 1 . 75 , P = 0 . 01 , 270 days PSO : 1 . 54 , 95 % CI 1 . 19 - 1 . 99 , P = 0 . 001 ) . During the observed time period , both children and adults had decreasing antibody concentrations over time . For children , the decrease was faster and more pronounced initially ( Figure 2 ) .

CHILD study , a large prospective seroprevalence study for SARS - CoV - 2 targeting children in a low - incidence setting . Previous seroprevalence studies carried out under lockdown have compared seroconversion rates between children and adults , and found these to be lower in children [ 14 – 16 ] . These findings must be interpreted with caution because different contact patterns of children under lockdown may play a substantial role . A large , population - based seroepidemiological study out of Wuhan , China , a place of high initial incidence , described similar seroprevalence in children and older age groups [ 17 ] . In our cohort , seroprevalence among children increased with age , as had been the case for other cohorts of the ancestral SARS - CoV - 2 , including a seroprevalence study in a similar time interval from the south of Germany [ 14 , 15 , 18 – 20 ] . These findings may have been specific to the ancestral variant of SARS - CoV - 2 and the circumstances governing the early 2020 first wave of coronavirus infections including few imported cases followed by lockdown . Subsequent infection waves , including novel viral variants , showed an increase in seropositivity in children [ 21 ] , probably based on the reopening of schools and daycare . At the same time comparison of seroprevalence in children to adults and older teenagers became less meaningful with the spread of vaccination [ 21 ] . We have found that in the case of exposure to a confirmed case of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , younger children zero to under six years had a relevantly smaller risk of seroconversion than older children . Consistently , lower secondary attack rates have been reported in children than in adults [ 22 – 24 ] . A large study on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics in two Indian states , which included children , provided evidence that contacts between people of similar age are more likely to lead to infection [ 25 ] . Thus , a lack of contact between children and their similar - age peers in a lockdown scenario might explain the differences between our data and studies in similar low - incidence settings [ 15 , 16 ] compared to seroprevalence studies in places with high initial incidence [ 17 ] . We report that seroconversion rates within families with index persons below the age of eighteen years were considerably lower . In our cohort , we made use of the relatively high availability of data on the index person in each family , as in the early phase of the pandemic the source of infection could still be identified in most cases . Most contact tracing and household cluster studies of SARS - CoV - 2 have suggested a lower risk of transmission by children [ 25 – 30 ] . In a large population based cohort study spanning the whole of 2020 , older children had a lower risk of transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 than younger children , but a comparison with adults was not described [ 31 ] . Again , these differences may relate to the highly different contact patterns of children under a general All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

CHILD Study began on May 11 , shortly before lockdown was lifted . In this period , contacts for children outside their own families were very limited and incidence of novel SARS - CoV - 2 infections was low ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Infection of most index persons in the C19 . CHILD cohort probably happened before the lockdown , which is supported by patient histories regarding symptomatic illness in late February and early March ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Subsequently , spread of infection would mostly have been limited to family clusters . As awareness of COVID - 19 was high in the public , it may be assumed that symptomatic children , especially teenagers , would have been isolated at home ( to the extent possible ) . The isolation of adult caregivers , however , may have been more difficult . As a result , less transmission would have occurred from children than adults . Alternatively , a less efficient biological transmission of the virus by children in the lockdown setting could explain our findings . As viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs appear to be similar in children and adults [ 32 , 33 ] , differences in respiratory droplet and aerosol formation [ 34 ] , respiratory anatomy [ 35 ] , or increased tropism of the virus in the upper vs . lower airways in children [ 36 , 37 ] , could contribute to the suggested differences in virus transmission . It should be noted , that transmission dynamics may be different for more recent variants of SARS - CoV - 2 . For the B . 1 . 617 . ( delta ) variant , viral loads appeared to be higher than for the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( alpha ) variant [ 38 ] , and significantly increased with age [ 39 ] . Research on the delta variant [ 40 ] , and preliminary reports on the omicron variant [ 41 , 42 ] indicate their increased airway replication fitness compared to the ancestral and alpha variants , and this could also significantly influence the infectiousness of children with COVID - 19 . In our cohort , we provide a longitudinal follow up of SARS - CoV - 2 serology over nine months after symptomatic illness , showing that children as well as adults retain both anti - spike IgG and anti - nucleocapsid IgA / IgG / IgM antibodies up to 270 days post - symptom onset ( PSO ) . To our knowledge this is the longest prospective follow - up of SARS - CoV - 2 serology with a direct comparison of children and their adult household contacts reported so far . Despite the time elapsed since the beginning of the pandemic , long - term follow up of quantitative serum antibody measurements such as ours for the ancestral SARS - CoV - 2 are scarce in adults and even less has been reported for children . A follow up of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 in people living in Wuhan [ 17 ] , as well as in Jiangsu [ 43 ] , China , showed antibodies to persist in a majority of cases over six months . However , the authors did not provide data according to time since symptom onset or the age of the participants . Previously , persistence of antibodies in children based on two serological tests 62 days apart was reported , but time since symptom onset was also unknown [ 44 ] .

A detailed immunological follow up of adults [ 46 ] after SARS - CoV - 2 infection showed similar results six to eight months PSO . Compared to adult family members , children in our cohort showed on average higher anti - spike IgG antibody levels in early reconvalescence ( less than 121 days PSO ) . This is in contrast to earlier reports showing lower neutralizing activity [ 47 ] or similar anti - spike IgG levels [ 48 ] compared to adults , albeit addressed in older pediatric subcohorts . Pre - existing memory B cells and natural antibodies [ 49 ] or T cell memory [ 50 , 51 ] in children on account of more frequent common - cold coronavirus infections may lead to quicker and more efficient SARS - CoV - 2 specific immune response and thus higher initial antibody concentrations . The same mechanisms might also contribute to the milder clinical course of SARS - CoV - 2 that is characteristic in children . Moreover , as demonstrated in our cohort , anti - spike IgG levels remained higher in children than adults over 193 days PSO , even though a more rapid decline in serum antibody concentrations of children was observed initially . There are limitations to this study . Teenagers were relatively underrepresented when compared to younger children and Hamburg census data . The retrospective nature of serological testing in this study did not allow for confirmation of infection by direct virus detection ( PCR ) , therefore seropositivity is used as a surrogate marker for past infection . Furthermore , PCR test results from study participants from the time of infection were not available and index cases in family clusters were identified based on patient history of symptomatic illness ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . A selection bias needs to be considered when interpreting our findings . First , our study included over 50 % volunteers , second , blood draws were more likely to have been carried out in older children . In this study , no serum neutralization tests have been performed . Instead , seropositivity was defined based on two different serum antibody tests , both of which have shown good correlation with plaque reduction neutralization tests [ 52 , 53 ] . While this approach does not measure direct antibody mediated protective immunity , it reduces the probability of false positive tests , especially when multiple family members are assessed . Since the samples used for antibody measurements in this study were obtained after the first 2020 wave of infections , they represent infections with the ancestral SARS - CoV - 2 which has now been replaced by more recent viral variants . In spite of this , our data is relevant to antibody responses after vaccination , because all current vaccines are based on inactivated virus or sequences from the ancestral SARS - CoV - 2 [ 54 – 57 ] . The setting in which our data was obtained is unique because widespread vaccination and possible repeat infections would complicate designing similar prospective studies in the present day .

Furthermore , seroconversion within households was lower in case of pediatric than adult index cases . Our findings showing a sustained long - term antibody responses in the pediatric population after the initial infection wave of SARS - CoV - 2 is relevant for vaccination efforts targeting children as well as newly emerging viral variants .
