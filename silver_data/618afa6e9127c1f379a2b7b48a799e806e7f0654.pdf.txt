Lipid bilayer membranes — ubiquitous in biological systems and closely associated with cell function— exhibit rich shape - transition behaviour , including bud formation 1 and vesicle ﬁs - sion 2 . Membranes formed from multiple lipid components can laterally separate into coexisting liquid phases , or domains , with distinct compositions . This process , which may resemble raft formation in cell membranes , has been directly observed in giant unilamellar vesicles 3 , 4 . Detailed theoretical frameworks 5 – 11 link the elasticity of domains and their boundary properties to the shape adopted by membranes and the formation of particular domain patterns , but it has been difﬁcult to experimentally probe and validate these theories . Here we show that high - resolution ﬂuorescence imaging using two dyes preferentially labelling different ﬂuid phases directly provides a correlation between domain composition and local membrane curvature . Using freely suspended membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles , we are able to optically resolve curvature and line tension interactions of circular , stripe and ring domains . We observe long - range domain ordering in the form of locally parallel stripes and hexagonal arrays of circular domains , curvature - dependent domain sorting , and membrane ﬁssion into separate vesicles at domain bound - aries . By analysing our observations using available membrane theory , we are able to provide experimental estimates of boundary tension between ﬂuid bilayer domains . We study giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) formed from a ternary mixture of the lipids sphingomyelin , dioleoylphos - phatidylcholine ( DOPC ) and cholesterol 3 . Sphingomyelin and cholesterol enrich in a liquid phase with short - range order ( L o ) , and DOPC prefers a disordered liquid ( L d ) phase . The phase diagram of this lipid mixture at physiologically relevant tempera - tures shows a large binary coexistence region of L o and L d domains ( A . K . Smith and G . W . Feigenson , personal communication ; see also Supplementary Information for further details ) . Figure 1 presents images of equatorial sections of GUVs ( obtained using two - photon microscopy ) , exhibiting phase coexistence of the L o ( blue ) þ L d ( red ) phases at varying compositions . Figure 1a – d shows shapes with symmetry around an axis in the vertical direction within the image plane . The geometry of phase - separated vesicles is theoretically obtained by minimizing an energy functional with contributions arising from bending resistance , lateral tensions , line tension and normal pressure difference . The bending energy F b of an axially symmetric lipid membrane has components arising from mean curvature ( ﬁrst term ) and Gauss curvature 12 , 13 ( second term ) , and is summed over every domain i of the vesicle 8 : F i b ¼ k i 2 ð A i C m þ C p 2 C 0 (cid:8) (cid:9) 2 d A þ k i G ð A i C m C p d A ð 1 Þ Here k , k G , C m and C p are mean and Gauss bending rigidities and principal curvatures along the meridians and parallels , respectively , and the integral is extended over all domain areas i . C 0 is a curvature preference , which is often assumed to be constant within a domain 5 , 8 , 11 but can in general vary locally 14 . The bending modulus k typically has a value of , 10 2 19 J ( ref . 15 ) . The second term in equation ( 1 ) inﬂuences the vesicle shape only if k i G values differ between domains i ( ref . 8 ) . Comparison of Fig . 1a and 1b , which show similar shapes even though the domains are reversed , suggests that bending resistance differences ( or any curvature preferences ) are not dominant in determining global vesicle shapes . In fact , a line tension j at the boundaries between coexisting ﬂuid membrane domains has been proposed to control membrane deformation , budding and ﬁssion 5 . Theoretical estimates of j are of the order of 10 2 11 N for systems far from 5 critical points of the lipid phase diagram , and j vanishes at critical points 5 , 16 . Above a limiting boundary length S 0 < 8 k / j < 80 nm , an initially ﬂat domain would transform into a com - plete spherical bud with vanishing neck radius , provided that sufﬁcient membrane area is available 5 . Accordingly , the domain boundary radii observed in Fig . 1 favour bud formation even for much smaller estimates of j . This simplifying theoretical description neglects the constraints on membrane domain areas and surface - to - volume ratio ( s / v ) , which are constant on the timescale of our experiment ( up to letters to nature NATURE | VOL 425 | 23 OCTOBER 2003 | www . nature . com / nature 821 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup 1 h ) , and also neglects the membrane geometry in the neck region of a budded domain . We show ( see Supplementary Information ) that for liposomes such as shown in Fig . 1 , line tension drives vesicles into a shape close to a limit shape characterized by a minimum domain boundary radius R b . This limit shape consists of truncated spheres , connected at the phase boundary , with areas and volumes of the spherical caps determined by the constrained vesicle volume and domain areas . A further transition into a shape with vanishing neck radius ( with vanishing mean curvature and line energy ) is suppressed by a lateral membrane domain tension S i . According to Fig . 1a , b and g , the meridional radius of curvature in the neck region is close to the limit of optical resolution . Many of the vesicles we analysed , however , suggest a high , but ﬁnite reverse meridional curvature in this region ( see , for example , Fig . 1b inset ) with a continuous membrane geometry ( as opposed to a kink ) , a reason - able assumption for domain boundaries of ﬁnite thickness within ﬂuid membranes . In the neck region , L d domains bend towards the L o domains ( as shown , for example , in Fig . 1b and g ) , suggesting smaller bending rigidities k of L d compared to L o phases 15 . The smaller rigidity ( or higher ﬂexibility ) of L d phases agrees with our observation that the L o phase exhibits smaller amplitudes of thermally excited out - of - plane undulations 15 , 17 . A reﬁned shape theory of Ju¨licher and Lipowsky 8 allowed us to devise a ﬁtting routine using ﬁve free parameters , and to determine mechanical vesicle parameters ( see Supplementary Information for details ) . To establish the fundamental relation between domain composition and mechanical properties requires the currently undetermined tie lines of domain coexistence in the ternary phase diagram of our lipid mixtures . We therefore focus , as an example , on the shape of the vesicle shown in Fig . 1c . There we obtain a line tension j < 9 ^ 0 . 3 £ 10 2 13 N , which is an order of magnitude smaller than Lipowsky’s above - mentioned rough estimate , which is based on an estimation of the energetic penalty arising from interfacial free energies of a cut across the lipid bilayer at the phase boundary 5 . However , our experimentally obtained value lies in the range of another theoretical estimate ( P . Kuzmin , S . Akimov , F . Cohen and J . Zimmerberg , personal communication ) , which minimizes the sum of energies from elastic compression / stretching and tilt , and hydrophobic height mismatch between the L o and L d membrane phases . Lateral tensions obtained were S L d < 8 . 2 ^ 0 . 1 £ 10 2 5 mN m 2 1 and S L o < 1 . 06 ^ 0 . 01 £ 10 2 4 mN m 2 1 , balanced by a pressure difference ( outer minus inner pressure ) of P < 2 1 . 83 ^ 0 . 01 £ 10 2 2 N m 2 2 . The lateral tensions signiﬁcantly suppress microscopically visible thermally excited out - of - plane undula - tions 18 , consistent with our observations . We obtain k L o = k L d < 1 . 25 ^ 0 . 60 , again suggesting a slightly higher bending rigidity of L o phases . In contrast to the above - mentioned ﬁtting parameters , the value of k L o = k L d is , however , associated with a high uncertainty . Our ﬁt shows a small systematic deviation , particularly in the neck region , which is readily understood by ( 1 ) the uncer - tainty of the experimental determination of the neck geometry , which is close to the optical resolution , and ( 2 ) the simplifying assumptions of the theory 8 , that is , a constant membrane compo - sition throughout a domain . In the case of the presence of cone - shaped lipids ( like cholesterol ) , steep local curvature gradients can cause lateral and interleaﬂet lipid redistribution 14 , 19 and therefore locally modify the mechanical membrane properties . If the s / v ratio is further increased , either by changing osmotic stress or by a temperature increase , we observe the formation of complete spherical buds , that is , closure of the neck at the domain edge 20 , and the ﬁssion into separate vesicles ( Fig . 1g , h shows a ﬁssion sequence ) . This occasional shape transition occurs abruptly ( timescale less than 0 . 5 s ; see Supplementary Movie ) , indicating an energy barrier 5 , 8 . In the case of neck radii R b approaching molecular dimensions , our experimental estimate of j indicates that the lateral tension S ¼ j / R b will rise to values where membranes are expected to rupture 5 . Indeed , we observe ﬁssion at the phase boundary , leaving vesicles that differ in their phase state and relative lipid composition ( see Fig . 1h and Supplementary Movie ) . In addition to phase - separated vesicles with one spheroidal domain , we ﬁnd vesicles with two , three and multiple caps ( Fig . 1d – f ) , often coexisting within the same sample ( vesicles shown in Fig . 1c – f were prepared from a lipid mixture of the same composition ) . It is possible that those liposomes with multiple caps lacking a curvature preference are not in a state of global energy minimum , as we frequently observe the dynamics of fusion of domains 4 , 11 , 21 , which reduces total line energy . In vesicles with Figure 1 Two - photon microscopy images showing equatorial sections of GUVs with L o þ L d phase coexistence . GUVs were labelled with perylene ( blue ) in L o phases and rho - DPPE ( red ) in L d phases . All images superimpose red and blue channels ( for separations , see Supplementary Fig . 1 0 ) .

Scale bars , 5 m m . letters to nature NATURE | VOL 425 | 23 OCTOBER 2003 | www . nature . com / nature 822 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup budding domains , however , this fusion step seems to be impeded , because domains tend to repel each other upon approach , avoiding high curvature build - up . Indeed , equatorial section images through GUVs with multiple caps ( Fig . 1d – f ; in these images the L o phase is continuous and contains separated spheroidal L d phase caps ) , as well as stacks of focal plane images of vesicle hemispheres showing domains of similar size ( Fig . 2a and b ) reveal approximate long - range ordering patterns of cap - shaped domains . Figure 2a and b shows arrangements into both hexagonal and inverted hexagonal patterns , depending on membrane composition . Long - range order - ing of ﬂuid membrane domains is clearly matched by a curvature pattern ( Figs 1d – f , and 2a and b ) . Domains imaged at room temperature are circular ( Fig . 2a and b ) 3 , 4 , 21 . When temperature was increased to values several degrees below the mixing / demixing transition temperature T m , in vesicles with and without excess curvature , we observed both L o phase and L d phase circular domains to undulate laterally , indicating reduced line tension at higher temperatures . Further temperature increase led to the formation of a homogeneous membrane . Thermally excited lateral domain undulations have normal mean square amplitudes k u 2 n l ¼ k B T = ð p r o j ð n 2 2 1 ÞÞ , where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is temperature , r 0 is the average domain radius and n is the mode number . Accordingly , domains with a radius r 0 < 5 m m , which visibly undulate with optically resolvable amplitudes , indi - cate a line tension below j < 10 2 14 N ( at high temperatures ) , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the room - temperature value determined from our shape ﬁtting . In - plane ﬂuctuations of domains at temperatures close to , but below , T m tend to increase when approaching a composition range ( mole fractions of sphingomyelin / DOPC / cholesterol ) of 0 . 63 ^ 0 . 035 / 0 . 07 ^ 0 . 035 / 0 . 3 ^ 0 . 05 . From preliminary data on the tempera - ture dependence of L o þ L d phase coexistence ( see Supplementary Information for further details ) , we assume this region to be near an upper critical mixing / demixing point , where line tension is expected to decrease as j / ( T c 2 T ) l ( here T c is the critical temperature , and the critical exponent l ¼ 1 ; refs 5 , 16 ) . Within this composition range , where L d phase domains in a continuous L o matrix are found , at temperatures less than one degree below T m , invesicles with excess area ( compared to a sphere ) , the undulating domains tend to assume strongly prolate elliptical shapes ; upon further increasing T , a shape instability leads to a stripe - out 7 , that is , the formation of numerous thin stripes , with varying ( ﬂuctuating ) lengths , which rapidly undulate in the plane of the membrane , and can span the whole liposome . We observed multiple stripe domains to arrange into laterally undulating pat - terns of locally parallel stripes . Close to T m , scanning microscopy was difﬁcult to apply to image these ﬂuctuating patterns . In favourable cases , however , rapid cooling by several degrees led to a sufﬁcient suppression of stripe pattern undulations ( and a slight thickness increase of stripes ) that the patterns could be imaged ( Fig . 2c ) . Again , an equatorial section through the same GUV ( Fig . 2d ) shows a pattern of membrane curvature matching the phase pattern . Two different pattern defects are observed ( Fig . 2c ) , namely the formation of loops and bifurcations with an angle near 120 8 . The relative thickness of stripes depends on membrane composition and temperature ( Fig . 2e ) . The stripe - out that we describe here resembles the rippling instability of collapsing bubbles 22 , but differs from stripe phase formation in polar lipid monolayers at the air / water interface 23 , as the long - range dipolar interaction of zwitterionic lipids is signiﬁ - cantly screened in the aqueous environment . Both an increase in total membrane area and the reduced line tension around buds near the main transition temperature will reduce lateral tension within the membrane , and favour the instability described above . Equilib - rium stripe phases associated with membrane deformation were also predicted 6 , 9 , 10 . Further theoretical study and systematic experi - ments are clearly required to fully understand the physics of this complex phenomenon . Fusion of the ends of a stripe is frequently observed , which upon cooling ( and thereby increasing the line tension ) leads to ( possibly metastable ) liposome - spanning ring domains ( Fig . 2e and f ) , where the line tension dominates the shape of these vesicles . Homogenous membranes with periodic curvature modulation , such as pearling states in tubular membranes 24 and ‘starﬁsh’ vesicles 25 at high s / v ratios , have previously been reported . We frequently observed these types of homogeneous membranes at temperatures above T m . Cooling slightly below T m leads to the Figure 2 Two - photon microscopy images of GUVs with L o þ L d phase coexistence .

In both cases , the L d phase is observed to favour saddle shapes , and the high - curvature tip region of the arms of the starﬁsh vesicle ( Fig . 2h ) , which again indicates smaller magnitudes of bending rigidities of L d phases compared to L o phase domains , which preferentially segregate into the lower - curvature tubular areas ( Fig . 2g and h ) . Owing to the high temperature and the particular membrane composition , line ten - sion effects are expected to be small in both cases . Note that domains in the essentially ﬂat central body of the starﬁshvesicle are randomly distributed , as they do not experience a signiﬁcant curvature gradient . The experimental approach and observations described here allow us to address two - dimensional critical phenomena , the inﬂuence of membrane additives on line tension , and to test and advance theories on membrane shape . Some of our observations may furthermore have analogues in fundamental biological mem - brane processes 26 , 27 . A Methods Vesicle preparation GUVsweremostly preparedbythemethod ofelectroswelling 28 , atatemperatureof60 8 C , in a solution of 100mM sucrose . Using GUVs prepared in 50mM KCl led to virtually the same phenomena observed at zero ionic strength . Lipid mixtures composed of varying fractions of sphingomyelin ( from egg ) , dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol were used . The elevated temperature ensured that GUVs were formed from swollen lipid membranes above the upper critical mixing / demixing temperature of L o / L d phase coexistence . The mixing / demixing temperature , T m , varied with composition ( see Supplementary Information for further details ) . Phase coexistence was observed at temperatures up to 56 ^ 0 . 2 8 C . Fluorescence labelling GUVs were labelled with two differentially partitioning membrane probes in order to distinguish between L o and L d domains . The headgroup labelled lipid probe N - lissamine rhodamine dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine ( rho - DPPE ) partitioned so effectively into L d domains that in many cases ( depending on the membrane composition ) no ﬂuorescence in the coexisting L o phase domains could be detected . The same behaviour was found for numerous other ﬂuorescence - labelled lipid or fatty acid analogues , including the widely used amphiphilic indocarbocyanine dye DiI . We found that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dye perylene ( among other polycyclic aromatic dyes of similar type ) partitions preferentially into the L o phase . The partitioning is , however , weakercomparedtorho - DPPE . Rho - DPPEwasaddedat1 / 1 , 000 ( dye / lipid ) . Perylenewas addedat1 / 500 .
