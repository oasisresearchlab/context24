Heppel , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY , May 27 , 1998 ( received for review December 7 , 1997 ) ABSTRACT Membrane tubules of uniform diameter ( 60 – 80 nm ) and various lengths ( up to several micrometers ) emanate from elements of the Golgi stack and trans Golgi network ( TGN ) . These organelle membrane tubules are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking and mainte - nance of Golgi y TGN architecture . The number of these tu - bules , and their frequency of formation , can be greatly en - hanced by the fungal metabolite brefeldin A ( BFA ) , an inhib - itor of Golgi y TGN - associated coated vesicle formation . We show here that BFA stimulation of Golgi and TGN membrane tubulation , and the resultant retrograde transport of resident Golgi enzymes to the endoplasmic reticulum , was potently inhibited by a number of membrane - permeant antagonists of phospholipase A 2 ( PLA 2 ; EC 3 . 1 . 1 . 4 ) activity . In addition , PLA 2 inhibitors on their own caused a reversible fragmenta - tion of the Golgi complex into juxtanuclear , stacked cisternal elements . We conclude from these observations that tubula - tion of Golgi complex and TGN membranes requires a PLA 2 activity , and that this activity may participate not only in Golgi tubule - mediated retrograde trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum , but also in the maintenance of Golgi complex architecture . The Golgi complex and trans Golgi network ( TGN ) are highly organized and morphologically complicated intracellular or - ganelles that serve as a hub of membrane trafficking in both the secretory ( biosynthetic ) and endocytic pathways ( 1 ) . Our understanding of the mechanisms by which membrane - bounded cargo traffics to and from the Golgi complex and TGN has been significantly advanced by extensive morpho - logical , biochemical , and genetic studies , which have estab - lished an important role for various types of coated vesicles ( COPI , COPII , and clathrin ) as mediators of intracellular membrane trafficking ( 2 , 3 ) . In addition , morphological stud - ies over the past 30 years have led some to speculate that organelle membrane tubules may also participate in traffick - ing . For example , membrane tubules , uniformly 60 – 80 nm in diameter , but variable in length ( up to several micrometers ) , have been seen to extend from the Golgi complex outwards into the cytoplasm and to form direct membrane continuities between otherwise spatially separate cisternal stacks ( 4 – 9 ) . Several years ago , the study of organelle membrane tubules was stimulated by the finding that brefeldin A ( BFA ) , a fungal metabolite that inhibits the formation of COPI - and clathrin - coated vesicles from Golgi and TGN membranes ( 10 ) , respec - tively , significantly enhanced the formation of tubules from these same organelles ( 10 – 13 ) . In the case of the Golgi complex , BFA induced the tubule - mediated retrograde move - ment of resident enzymes back to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( 11 , 12 ) , whereas TGN tubules fused with early endo - somes ( 12 , 13 ) . Studies with BFA suggested , therefore , that membrane tubules may serve as important mediators of traf - ficking events between various organelles . Support for this idea has recently emerged from time - lapse fluorescence imaging studies , which demonstrated that , at steady state , membrane tubules are continuously forming and detaching from the Golgi complex ( 14 ) . The molecular mechanisms that lead directly or indirectly to the formation of Golgi and TGN membrane tubules are only beginning to be understood . For example , BFA - stimulated tubulation and retrograde transport are greatly facilitated by , but not absolutely dependent upon , microtubules and the microtubule - associated motor protein , kinesin ( 10 – 13 , 15 ) . However , because the formation of short ( , 1 m m long ) membrane tubules ( 13 ) , and subsequent retrograde trafficking to the ER , still occurs even when microtubules have been depolymerized , albeit more slowly ( 10 , 14 ) , other cytoplasmic factors would also appear to be involved in tubule formation . Support for this idea was obtained by showing that the formation of Golgi membrane tubules could be reconstituted in vitro in a microtubule - independent , cytosolic protein - dependent manner ( 16 , 17 ) . These studies demonstrated that in vitro tubulation required relatively low concentrations of a highly enriched , heat - labile fraction of bovine brain cytosol , suggesting that the activity may function enzymatically . A clue to possible cytoplasmic activities that may directly or indirectly regulate Golgi membrane tubulation came from studies showing that BFA - stimulated tubulation of both Golgi complex and endosomal membranes was potently inhibited by calmodulin antagonists ( 18 ) . Moreover , these same antago - nists inhibited receptor recycling from various endosomal compartments ( 18 , 19 ) , consistent with the idea that organelle membrane tubules play a role in intracellular trafficking . Given calmodulin’s typical role as a regulatory protein ( 20 ) , it is unlikely to be directly responsible for the formation of mem - brane tubules . Of the many possible calmodulin targets , one class of enzymes , the cytoplasmic phospholipases , was partic - ularly intriguing because they have long been thought to be involved in membrane remodeling and signal transduction ( 21 , 22 ) , some are regulated by calmodulin ( 23 ) , and an extensive pharmacology of phospholipases exists ( 24 ) , thereby providing tools for a pharmacological test of the potential role of phospholipases in membrane tubulation . We report here that a wide variety of general and specific membrane - permeant phospholipase inhibitors potently and rapidly inhibit BFA - stimulated tubulation of Golgi complex and TGN membranes The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

Together , the results suggest that an intracellular phospholipase A 2 ( PLA 2 ; EC 3 . 1 . 1 . 4 ) activity may be inti - mately involved in membrane tubulation and in the trafficking events these tubules may mediate . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials . Phospholipase and other inhibitors were ob - tained from the following sources : N - ( p - amylcinnamoyl ) an - thranilic acid ( ACA ) , arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone ( AACOCF 3 ) , aristolochic acid ( ARA ) , baicalein , 7 , 7 - dimethyleicosadienoic acid ( DEDA ) , eicosatriynoic acid ( ETI ) , 2 - ( p - amylcinnamoyl ) amino - 4 - cholorobenzoic acid ( ONO - RS - 082 ) , palmityl trifluoromethyl ketone ( PACOCF 3 ) , and prostaglandin E 2 ( PGE 2 ) were from Biomol ( Plymouth Meeting , PA ) ; E - 6 - ( bromomethylene ) tetrahydro - 3 - ( 1 - naphthalenyl ) - 2 H - pyran - 2 - one ( HELSS , or bromoenol lac - tone , BEL ) was originally synthesized in the Katzenellenbogen laboratory ( 25 ) and later was obtained from Biomol ; quina - crine , dibucaine , esculetin , ibuprofen , indomethacin , p - bromophenacyl bromide , and all other common reagents were from Sigma . Unlabeled lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids . Cell Culture and Treatments . Clone 9 rat hepatocytes were maintained in minimal essential medium ( MEM ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicillin y streptomycin at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95 % air y 5 % CO 2 . In a typical experiment , cells were plated onto coverslips ( for immunoflu - orescence ) or 35 - mm dishes ( for immunoperoxidase ) and allowed to grow for 2 days before treatment with BFA and y or inhibitors as described ( 18 ) . Specific details of each experiment will be given in the figure legends . Each inhibitor was freshly prepared as a 1000 3 stock solution in organic solvent ( either 100 % ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide as appropriate ) and then diluted into MEM just before use . Immunocytochemistry . Cells were processed for single or double immunofluorescence labeling ( 13 ) or for immunoper - oxidase labeling and electron microscopy ( EM ) ( 26 ) as de - scribed . Primary antibodies used in these studies were as follows : polyclonal anti - a - mannosidase II ( a ManII ) ( from M . G . Farquhar , Univ . of California at San Diego , or K . Moreman , Univ . of Georgia ) ; monoclonal anti - b - COP ( from Affinity BioReagents ) ; polyclonal anti - cation independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( 13 ) ; monoclonal anti - clathrin heavy chain ( from Affinity BioReagents , Neshanic Station , NJ ) . Fluorescent secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch . Goat anti - rabbit IgG Fab fragments cou - pled to horseradish peroxidase were from Biosys ( Compiegne , France ) . In Vitro b - COP Binding . Examination of the effects of BFA and PLA 2 inhibitors on the association of b - COP with isolated Golgi membranes was performed essentially as described ( 16 ) . Lysophosphatidylcholine ( lyso - PC ) Analysis . Cell - associ - ated [ 3 H ] lyso - PC levels were measured from lipid extracts of clone 9 cells as described ( 27 ) , except that lipids were resolved on aluminum - backed silica gel thin - layer chromatography plates ( AL SIL G y UV ; Whatman ) ( 27 ) . Spots corresponding to lyso - PC and PC were cut out and placed into liquid scintillation vials , and radioactivity was then measured by liquid scintillation counting . To determine the percent change in lyso - PC content , the ratio lyso - PC y ( lyso - PC 1 PC ) was calculated for each experimental condition , normalized to that obtained for the untreated control , and expressed as a per - centage of that control . All values presented represent data garnered from duplicate experiments ( all duplicate values differed by less than 10 % ) . RESULTS In untreated clone 9 cells the Golgi complex appears as a juxtanuclear interconnected reticulum by immunofluores - cence localization of the medial Golgi enzyme a ManII ( Fig . 1 A ) . As expected , treatment with BFA resulted in the very rapid tubulation of Golgi membranes and their retrograde movement and fusion with the ER , generating , by 10 min , a characteristic diffuse staining pattern and nuclear envelope localization ( 11 , 12 ) ( Fig . 1 B ) . Pretreatment of cells with the irreversible membrane - permeant PLA 2 inhibitor BEL ( 28 , 29 ) , at 1 m M , slowed this BFA - induced process such that many cells contained Golgi - derived tubular intermediates ( Fig . 1 C ) . At 10 m M BEL the tubulation and retrograde transport of a ManII were almost completely blocked ( Fig . 1 D ) . This inhibition of tubulation and retrograde transport was observed in several other cell types ( HeLa , COS ) and was confirmed by im - muno - EM using anti - a ManII antibodies ( data not shown ) . Although PLA 2 inhibitors blocked the tubulation and ret - rograde transport of Golgi membranes induced by BFA , immunofluorescence of a ManII revealed that the Golgi com - plex was nevertheless altered from its normal morphology as it became ‘‘fragmented’’ under these conditions ( Fig . 1 D ) . In fact , we found that treatment of cells with low concentrations of PLA 2 inhibitors alone , including the reversible inhibitor ONO - RS - 082 ( 30 ) , resulted in the formation of large Golgi fragments ( Fig . 1 E ) , which reassembled after removal of the drug ( Fig . 1 F ) . These large fragments always remained in the juxtanuclear region , did not diffuse into the peripheral cyto - plasm , and were composed of cisternal stacks that appeared , by immunoperoxidase localization of a ManII at the EM level , indistinguishable from typical Golgi stacks ( Fig . 2 ) . Similarly , we found that inhibition of BFA - stimulated Golgi membrane F IG . 1 .

Cell Biology : de Figueiredo et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 95 ( 1998 ) 8643 tubulation by ONO - RS - 082 was reversible after washout of the inhibitor ( data not shown ) . One possible explanation for the inhibitory effect of PLA 2 antagonists is that they prevent the BFA - induced dissociation of COPI proteins from Golgi membranes , and hence , the tubulation and retrograde transport that otherwise ensue in the presence of BFA . However , double - immunofluorescence labeling with a monoclonal antibody against the cis Golgi antigen 10E6 ( 13 ) and polyclonal antibodies against b - COP revealed that treatment with ONO - RS - 082 before BFA did not inhibit redistribution of b - COP from Golgi membranes to the cytosol ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , BEL did not inhibit BFA from causing the loss of b - COP from isolated Golgi membranes ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , PLA 2 inhibitors were not exerting their effects on Golgi - associated coat protein dynamics . Another compartment that forms tubules in response to BFA is the TGN . In fact , at a given BFA concentration , TGN tubules form slightly slower than Golgi - derived tubules , and are therefore often more easily visualized by , for example , immunofluorescence localization of the cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( M6PR ) ( 13 ) . In control cells , M6PRs appeared in juxtanuclear tubules and vesicles of the TGN and endosomes ( Fig . 5 A ) , whereas treatment with BFA for 15 min resulted in the formation of extensive TGN tubules ( Fig . 5 C ) . Importantly , these tubules failed to form when cells F IG . 4 . BFA - induced loss of b - COP from isolated Golgi mem - branes in vitro occurs in the presence of the PLA 2 inhibitor BEL .

( 3 540 . ) 8644 Cell Biology : de Figueiredo et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 95 ( 1998 ) were pretreated with ONO - RS - 082 ( 10 m M ) for just 5 min ( Fig . 5 E ) . As with b - COP on Golgi membranes , ONO - RS - 082 prevented tubulation of the TGN but did not prevent the BFA - induced redistribution of clathrin complexes from TGN membranes to the cytosol ( Fig . 5 B , D , and F ) . The inhibition of BFA - stimulated tubulation of TGN membranes by various PLA 2 inhibitors was confirmed by immuno - EM using anti - M6PR antibodies ( data not shown ) . The ability to monitor the movement of Golgi and TGN proteins by immunofluorescence provided the basis for a sensitive quantitative assay of the effects of PLA 2 inhibitors on BFA - stimulated tubulation . In BFA - treated cells , tubulation and retrograde transport of a ManII to the ER was essentially complete by 5 – 10 min ( Fig . 6 ) . However , over the same time course , a variety of PLA 2 inhibitors significantly slowed this process . Using this same assay with a fixed time point , we determined a dose – response and IC 50 for various PLA 2 inhib - itors ( Table 1 ) . Significantly , all of the PLA 2 inhibitors tested potently blocked BFA - stimulated tubulation of Golgi and TGN membranes ( all at low micromolar concentrations ) . Among the more specific inhibitors of cytosolic PLA 2 s shown here to prevent BFA - stimulated tubulation are the site - specific reagents AACOCF 3 and PACOCF 3 , trifluoromethyl ketone derivatives of arachidonic and palmitic acids , respectively ( 29 , 31 , 32 ) , and BEL , as mentioned above , a mechanism - based suicide substrate that displays 1000 - fold more selectivity for a cytosolic Ca 2 1 - independent PLA 2 vs . Ca 2 1 - dependent PLA 2 ( 28 , 29 ) . Tubulation of both Golgi and TGN membranes in vivo is greatly facilitated by microtubules ( 11 – 13 ) , so we examined cells treated with PLA 2 inhibitors by immunofluorescence with anti - tubulin antibodies . We found no obvious effects on mi - crotubule number or distribution , except in the case of bro - mophenacyl bromide ( BPB ) which , on its own , significantly depolymerized microtubules ( data not shown ) . However , the effect of BPB on microtubules could be separated from its inhibitory effect on tubulation by first stabilizing cytoplasmic microtubules with Taxol ( data not shown ) . An intracellular PLA 2 , catalyzing the hydrolysis of glycero - phospholipids into lysophospholipids and free fatty acids , could induce tubulation by directly altering membrane struc - ture ( 33 , 34 ) , or alternatively , the downstream metabolites of phospholipid hydrolysis could act indirectly as signaling mol - ecules to somehow regulate tubulation . The best - studied in - tracellular PLA 2 product is arachidonic acid , which can be enzymatically converted to numerous bioactive signaling mol - ecules via the cyclooxygenase , lipoxygenase , and cytochrome P 450 pathways ( 35 ) . Thus , blocking the subsequent metabolism of arachidonic acid might also affect tubulation . However , using a variety of specific and nonspecific inhibitors of ara - chidonic acid metabolism , including indomethacin , ibuprofen , esculetin , baicalein , and ETI ( Table 1 ) , we found no effect on BFA - stimulated tubulation . Similarly , we found that neomycin sulfate , an inhibitor of phospholipases C and D at the con - centrations tested here ( 36 ) , had no inhibitory effects . Finally , to demonstrate that the PLA 2 antagonists were in fact inhibiting the activities of these enzymes , we measured in cell extracts lyso - PC levels , which would be expected to decrease in the presence of PLA 2 inhibitors . Using conditions of BEL treatment previously shown decrease lyso - PC levels in other cell types ( 27 ) , we found that treatment of clone 9 cells with BEL reduced the amount of lyso - PC in cell extracts to 71 % of control levels , a reduction roughly comparable to that seen in other cells ( 27 ) . Importantly , a similar reduction ( to 69 % of controls ) was seen when BFA ( 10 m g y ml ) was added in the presence of BEL , suggesting that BFA did not perturb this compound’s ability to inhibit the relevant phospholipase activities . DISCUSSION The idea that a cytosolic tubulation factor , operating at the level of the Golgi complex , might work enzymatically was suggested from our in vitro studies in which isolated Golgi complexes were induced to form membrane tubules by using very low concentrations a heat - labile fraction of cytosolic proteins that is highly enriched in tubulation activity ( 16 , 17 ) . Our finding here that a wide variety of both general and specific PLA 2 inhibitors potently block Golgi and TGN mem - brane tubulation is consistent with these previous studies . The effect of the PLA 2 inhibitors was rapid ( within 5 min of addition ) , suggesting that they were influencing events closely or directly related to the formation of Golgi tubules . F IG . 6 . Time course of BFA - induced retrograde movement of a ManII from the Golgi complex to the ER and its inhibition by various PLA 2 inhibitors . Cells were pretreated with various PLA 2 inhibitors or solvent controls for 5 min , then BFA ( 10 m g y ml ) was added and cells were incubated for up to 15 min . After treatment , cells were fixed and a ManII was localized by immunofluorescence . Cells were then counted to determine the percentage in which a ManII exhibited a diffuse , ER - like staining pattern that results from BFA - stimulated , tubule - mediated retrograde transport .

Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 95 ( 1998 ) 8645 Although these in vivo studies cannot definitively identify the type of phospholipase activity that participates in BFA - stimulated tubulation , they are consistent with the idea that cytoplasmic PLA 2 activity participates in this process . For example , the inhibitors aristolochic acid , ACA , and ONO - RS - 082 , as well as the more specific substrate analogs AACOCF 3 and PACOCF 3 , are specific and potent inhibitors of cytoplas - mic PLA 2 s ( 29 , 31 ) . Moreover , the IC 50 values of these inhibitors on tubulation were generally very close to those for inhibition of known PLA 2 activities ( 24 ) . Our results here showing that tubulation is potently inhibited by BEL are particularly interesting in light of recent studies showing that this inhibitor is 1000 - fold more selective for a Ca 2 1 - independent PLA 2 than for its Ca 2 1 - dependent counterpart ( 28 , 29 ) . Moreover , this ’ 85 - kDa Ca 2 1 - independent PLA 2 interacts with calmodulin ( 23 ) , an intriguing finding in light of our previous studies showing that membrane tubulation of multiple organelles in vivo is sensitive to calmodulin antago - nists ( 18 ) . However , because some of the examined com - pounds may inhibit enzymes that are also known to exhibit phospholipase A 1 , platelet - activating - factor hydrolase , and lysophospholipase activities in various in vitro and in vivo systems ( 22 ) , we cannot rule out the possibility that these kinds of enzyme activities may also contribute to the tubulation events . Preliminary studies utilizing our cytosol - dependent in vitro tubulation assay show that these same PLA 2 inhibitors potently block tubule formation ( P . d . F . , R . S . , and W . J . B . , unpublished data ) , indicating that this assay should be useful for identifying the exact phospholipase activity responsible for Golgi membrane tubulation . The mechanism by which a PLA 2 could impart such a dramatic change in membrane shape in a biological setting is unclear . One possibility is that downstream metabolites of PLA 2 hydrolysis , such as those generated during arachidonic acid metabolism , could serve as signaling molecules to stim - ulate indirectly the tubulation machinery . Though our studies showing that a variety of inhibitors of arachidonic acid me - tabolism had no effect on BFA - stimulated tubulation of Golgi membranes argue against this idea , we cannot unequivocally rule out this possibility because the relevant pathways may not have been targeted , or sufficiently inhibited . Another possibility , not mutually exclusive of any signaling role , is that hydrolysis of a phospholipid into a lysophospho - lipid and free fatty acid is directly responsible for inducing tubule growth . Could such a mechanism produce this kind of dramatic membrane transformation ? In fact , Sheetz and Singer ( 37 ) proposed the bilayer couple hypothesis to account for this type of membrane behavior . This model articulates the idea that the two leaflets of a phospholipid bilayer are inexorably coupled such that a change in the surface area of one leaflet forces both leaflets of the membrane bilayer to accommodate by bending . For example , increasing the surface area in the outer leaflet of a red blood cell ( 33 , 37 ) or artificial liposome ( 34 ) results in the formation of blebs or tubules that extend out from the membrane bilayer . Could a PLA 2 generate such a change in surface area to produce tubules ? Biophysical studies have established that hydrolysis by PLA 2 of glycero - phospholipids ( e . g . , PC ) within membranes can produce dra - matic shape changes , including the formation of blebs and tubules ( 33 , 38 ) . Moreover , inserting lysophospholipids into the outer leaflet of artificial liposomes can result in the formation of membrane tubules ( 34 ) , which are remarkably similar in size and morphology to Golgi and TGN - derived tubules . Thus , the suggestion that tubulation of Golgi and TGN membranes in vivo may depend on a cytosolic PLA 2 activity that liberates lysophospholipids and fatty acids , thus increasing local lysophospholipid concentrations , is consistent with bio - physical studies on membrane shape changes . In this regard , we could not measure a detectable increase in lyso - PC levels in extracts from BFA - treated cells . However , any such increase may be difficult to detect , given that only a small fraction of intracellular membranes tubulate in response to BFA , and that only a small change in the mole fraction of lipids within a half bilayer is required to impart large shape changes ( 33 , 37 ) . Of course , the generation of phospholipid metabolites might have other effects that could contribute to changes in membrane structure , including generation of lipid microdomains , phase changes , or the selective association of membrane or periph - eral proteins . Several studies have shown that membrane tubule formation from the Golgi complex and TGN is greatly facilitated by , but not absolutely dependent upon , microtubules ( 10 – 16 ) . On the basis of these observations , and our results here , we speculate that Golgi membrane tubulation is at least a two - step process involving , first , the phospholipase - dependent formation of short membrane tubules , which , secondarily , are captured and pulled along microtubules by kinesin motor proteins ( 15 ) to facilitate tubule - mediated trafficking events . The exact role that Golgi - derived tubules play in membrane trafficking is unclear . Their presence and possible contribution to Golgi - to - ER retrograde trafficking is most evident in BFA - treated cells ; however , the extent to which they contribute to this pathway in untreated cells is unknown . Direct imaging of live cells by using chimeras consisting of Golgi resident en - zymes fused with green fluorescent protein indicate that tubules are continuously formed from Golgi membranes ( 14 ) . Although the exact fate of these tubules ( recycling to the ER ? ) has not been unequivocally demonstrated , these studies are consistent with the idea that Golgi - derived tubules play a role in retrograde transport . We have , in fact , recently found that normal Golgi - to - ER retrograde trafficking , as assayed by visualizing a variety of proteins that bidirectionally traffic between the ER and Golgi complex , is potently inhibited by the same PLA 2 inhibitors shown here to block BFA - stimulated Golgi tubulation and recycling ( unpublished data ) . Another possible functional role for membrane tubules may be to link separate cisternal Golgi stacks into a large inter - connected organelle ( 39 ) . Numerous studies using , for exam - ple , three - dimensional image reconstructions from serial thin sections and fluorescence imaging of Golgi morphology have documented the existence of such tubular interconnections ( 4 – 8 ) . Our finding that PLA 2 inhibitors on their own caused the Golgi complex to separate into large fragments , which retained the typical Golgi stacked cisternal architecture , sug - gests that maintenance of this architecture may require a dynamic process of PLA 2 - dependent tubule formation . The fragmented Golgi stacks produced by PLA 2 inhibitors are quite different from those generated after depolymerization of microtubules , which in the later case appear to form because nascent Golgi stacks , assembling from recycled Golgi resident proteins at peripheral ER export sites , fail to converge at the microtubule organizing center ( 40 ) . Therefore , studies with PLA 2 inhibitors , at the very least , point to the possibility that membrane tubules may serve as trafficking intermediates in several Golgi - associated processes .
