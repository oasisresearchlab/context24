ABSTRACT Complex systems are present in such diverse areas as social systems , economies , ecosystems and biology and , therefore , are highly relevant to dental research , education and practice . A Complex Adaptive System in biological development is a dynamic process in which , from interacting components at a lower level , higher level phenomena and structures emerge . Diversity makes substantial contributions to the performance of complex adaptive systems . It enhances the robustness of the process , allowing multiple responses to external stimuli as well as internal changes . From diversity comes variation in outcome and the possibility of major change ; outliers in the distribution enhance the tipping points . The development of the dentition is a valuable , accessible model with extensive and reliable databases for investigating the role of complex adaptive systems in craniofacial and general development . The general characteristics of such systems are seen during tooth development : self - organization ; bottom - up emergence ; multitasking ; self - adaptation ; variation ; tip - ping points ; critical phases ; and robustness . Dental ﬁndings are compatible with the Random Network Model , the Thresh - old Model and also with the Scale Free Network Model which has a Power Law distribution . In addition , dental development shows the characteristics of Modularity and Clustering to form Hierarchical Networks . The interactions between the genes ( nodes ) demonstrate Small World phenomena , Subgraph Motifs and Gene Regulatory Networks . Genetic mechanisms are involved in the creation and evolution of variation during development . The genetic factors inter - act with epigenetic and environmental factors at the molecular level and form complex networks within the cells . From these interactions emerge the higher level tissues , tooth germs and mineralized teeth . Approaching development in this way allows investigation of why there can be variations in phenotypes from identical genotypes ; the phenotype is the out - come of perturbations in the cellular systems and networks , as well as of the genotype . Understanding and applying complexity theory will bring about substantial advances not only in dental research and edu - cation but also in the organization and delivery of oral health care . Keywords : Complex systems , networks , dental development . INTRODUCTION Dental development displays the characteristics of a Complex Adaptive System , being Self Adaptive and Self Organizing . 1 The multiple interacting components at a lower level give rise to higher level emergent phenom - ena . The mature dentition also behaves dynamically , retaining the capacity for its individual units and the whole to adapt to environmental demands . 2 In contrast , in a system that is complicated rather than complex , the various elements maintain a degree of independence and do not develop a new structure . In this paper we use the dentition , for which there are extensive hard data for many aspects of development , as a paradigm for craniofacial and general development . The genetic code is identical in 99 % of the cells of the body and it is the epigenetic mechanisms which control the switching on and off of particular genes in speciﬁc tissues . 3 Complex systems are present in such diverse areas as social systems , economies , ecosystems and biology . Complex biological systems and cellular networks may underlie most genotype to phenotype relation - ships . 4 There are many aspects of dentistry where understanding complex systems has a major role in advancing understanding , treatment and the organiza - tion of care . Examples have already been provided in © 2014 Australian Dental Association 13 Australian Dental Journal 2014 ; 59 : ( 1 Suppl ) : 13 – 22 doi : 10 . 1111 / adj . 12158 Australian Dental Journal The ofﬁcial journal of the Australian Dental Association identifying molecular biotypes for periodontal disease 5 and in dental education . 6 The main aim of this paper is to provide additional evidence that the dentition is a complex adaptive sys - tem and demonstrate how this approach can be more widely exploited in dentistry . This will be done by outlining the characteristics of complex systems and of networks , emphasizing the preferential attachment model of network growth in such systems . Diversity makes substantial contributions to the performance of a complex adaptive system . It enhances the robustness of the process , allowing multiple responses to external stimuli as well as internal changes . From diversity comes variation in outcome and the possibility of major change as outliers in the distribution enhance the prob - ability of exceeding thresholds or tipping points . The major components and phases of the development of the dentition into a mature functioning system will then be examined and considered against the general charac - teristics of complex adaptive systems . Speciﬁc examples and further evidence will be considered , including several statistical models that have been linked to aspects of complex adaptive systems . CHARACTERISTICS OF A DEVELOPMENTAL COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEM A complex adaptive system in biological development is a dynamic process in which higher level phenomena and structures emerge from interacting components at a lower level . Complexity science aims at the quanti - tative modelling of emergent phenomena at a macro - scopic level caused by the many interactions taking place at a microscopic level . Everything changes with time and in complex systems the dynamic interactions of the microscopic mechanisms may include spas - modic release of an internal strain with major changes . Interactions among the constituents give rise to emergent hierarchical network structures . Self - organization and emergence Bottom - up self - organization in a biological system arises from the interaction at a molecular level of genetic , epigenetic and environmental factors . From these interactions within cells and with the surrounding matrix , development and organization within the tissues occur and higher level organs emerge . These organs bear no physical resemblance to the precursor entities . 7 , 8 The emergence and stability of these biological patterns can be inﬂuenced by stochastic , random perturbations of highly non - linear systems ; noise in a system may contribute to a temporal pattern of gene expression dur - ing development . 9 Such weak emergence arises from interactions at the elemental level and can be deter - mined by stimulating or observing the system . 10 Multitasking Cells multitask by carrying out multiple functions . Multitasking also occurs as separate genetic pathways run in parallel and certain functional genes and signal - ling pathways act reiteratively controlling different stages of development . Further multitasking also occurs as an individual cell type simultaneously controls differ - ent functions . Pleiotrophy is seen as one gene inﬂuences multiple phenotypic traits and the interactions of cells in complex networks give rise to different outcomes . Self - adaptation Marked variation arises during development , not from a different number or type of genes in a speciﬁc tissue but rather from the epigenetic switches used to turn genes on and off and control their expression , together with the inﬂuences of environment . During a complex biological development process there are critical phases or tipping points . These are temporo - spatial events that must be completed to allow further progress , acting as thresholds . Failure to complete such a critical phase is likely to result in regression , apoptosis or , if the overall development of the organ continues , a developmental defect . The robustness of the biological system , on the other hand , is its ability to proceed with development in the face of challenges such as a genetic mutation or a major environmental insult and so maintain func - tionality . This robustness is increased by excess provi - sion or ‘redundancy’ . This occurs when different genes can produce similar products , so when there is insufﬁciency due to a mutation , another gene can be switched on to cover the deﬁciency . Moreover , the outcome of the developmental process , e . g . the denti - tion , may be robust enough and sufﬁciently well - formed to function satisfactorily in spite of containing some marked variation or developmental defects . Diversity The performance of complex adaptive systems is enhanced by diversity , with variation increasing the robustness of the system . The possibility of multiple responses to external events , as well as internal changes , increases the robustness of the process . Variation also increases the possibility of major changes in outcome as the probability of passing a threshold is greater . Networks Networks in biological systems follow a series of orga - nizing principles in their structure . Therefore , network theory aims to understand the origins and characteris - tics of the network components in complex systems . 14 © 2014 Australian Dental Association AH Brook et al . Such networks are regulated by fundamental laws that determine their behaviour . 11 Seeking to understand cell function must include exploring the intricate networks through which the proteins and metabolites interact . Extensive databases contain details of the human genome . However , these databases do not explain how the multiple components required for develop - ment interact and function as a system . Rather the multiple functions within and between cells occur by networks with a discrete modular organization . The network contains groups of diverse molecules , referred to as nodes , each having a different cellular function . Nodes are connected via links with other nodes , and those with more connections to other nodes become the hubs of the network . Modularity is a deﬁning fea - ture of most complex systems . Most networks show a high degree of clustering with modules representing highly interlinked local regions in the network . NETWORK MODELS AND COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS Several network models have been linked with differ - ent aspects of complex adaptive systems . The behav - iour of most complex systems emerges from the orchestrated interactions of many components . Cellu - lar function exhibits quantiﬁable patterns . 12 Network models are essential for understanding complex net - works and such network models can be explored to help in interpreting observed characteristics . Random network model In random networks , most nodes have approximately the same number of links . Nodes that are highly con - nected and signiﬁcantly deviate from the average are infrequent . A continuous normal distribution is found in studies of a number of parameters of development , such as adult height and the mesiodistal and buccolin - gual linear crown dimensions of teeth . Threshold model In this model there is a normal distribution of an underlying , continuously varying parameter upon which a threshold is superimposed . Beyond this threshold a different character is expressed , which is seemingly discontinuous with that of the underlying distribution ( Fig . 1 ) . For this reason it has sometimes been termed a quasi - continuous distribution . Scale - free network model The concept of scale - free networks and a proposed mechanism for their emergence has been outlined . 13 When all the different examples of a parameter under consideration are counted , e . g . the individual words in a scientiﬁc paper , most will have occurred infre - quently but a small number will have been present more frequently and a few very frequently . When plotted graphically such ﬁndings give rise to a Power Law distribution ( Fig . 2 ) which in linguistic studies has often been termed a Zipf distribution . 14 Thus , the network’s properties are often determined by a small number of highly connected nodes , the hubs . 11 Many real networks , including human protein - protein interaction and metabolic networks are scale - free . 15 In complex networks with scale - free topology , two mechanisms are at work , growth and preferential attachment . Growth occurs as new nodes are added . Preferential attachments occur when new nodes link preferentially to nodes that already have more attachments . 13 A generalized growth model for biological networks demonstrates the same network properties . 16 Hierarchical network model Modularity appears to be a characteristic of interac - tions within cells , as considered above . To account for the co - existence of modularity , scale - free networks and local clustering in biological systems , it is postu - lated that clusters combine to form a hierarchical net - work . 17 F r e qu e n c y Continuous distribution of trait Different , apparently discontinuous trait Threshold Fig . 1 A Normal distribution with a threshold beyond which a different character is expressed .

This process is then repeated a number of times . The resultant structure will have a very small number of ‘super - hubs’ , a few hubs and many nodes ( Fig . 3 ) . When plotted graphically this modular network will conform with a scale - free , power law distribution . This hierarchical clustering is a generic property of a large number of real networks including those in the cell 11 and metabolism . 18 Small - World phenomena Most complex networks , including random networks , have the small - world property , so that there are rela - tively short paths between any pair of nodes . There - fore , perturbing the state of a given node can affect the activity of other nodes in the vicinity and of the network itself . 15 Figure 4 shows a theoretical example of the preferential attachment model of network growth in which the most highly connected nodes attract more new connections . Subgraphs , motifs and motif clusters The scale - free and hierarchical features of complex net - works illustrate the principles of a network’s large scale structure . Another way of characterizing a network is to consider what patterns of interactions are present . A subset of nodes connected to each other in a speciﬁc pattern can be represented as a connected subgraph . Networks with a more intricate structure may have var - ious different subgraphs . 19 Within this more intricate structure , or complex network , all subgraphs may be present but they do not occur with equal frequency . Subgraphs which occur signiﬁcantly more frequently in a real network are designated to be motifs . Net - work motifs can be considered as the building blocks of a complex network . 20 The subgraphs and motifs that are found in a network are not independent of each other . Clustering of motifs into ‘motif clusters’ may be a general property of real networks . 12 Gene regulation networks Gene expression models address the mechanisms of gene regulation . The stochastic nature of biological processes can have important functional roles in a cell , such as physiological regulation and adaptation . A probability model for gene regulatory networks that represents the concentration levels of each agent in the network has been proposed . 21 THE COMPONENTS OF DENTAL DEVELOPMENT In this section , the major characteristics and phases of dental development will be outlined and analysed . ( For more detailed consideration of genetic aspects see the paper by Thesleff 22 in this special issue ) . Dental development displays spatiotemporal , multidimen - sional , multilevel and multifactorial properties . It occurs by multiple interactions between various fac - tors and is inﬂuenced by a series of developmental ﬁelds . As each tooth progresses through its different developmental stages , it is affected by its timing and position in relation to other teeth . These components are set out in Table 1 . Dental development is multidimensional . The molecular and cellular interactions , the soft tissue tooth germ and the calciﬁed tooth all operate and are formed in three spatial dimensions . These spatial dimensions also relate to the position of the unit in the tooth type series , in the same dental arch and the opposing arch . The dimension of time has great inﬂu - ence as there are thresholds to be passed at speciﬁc developmental stages and the total time of tooth development extends from six weeks in utero to some 20 years of age . Multiple levels are present . From molecular and cel - lular interactions , within and between tissues , the soft tissue tooth germ emerges , grows and organizes . From this germ , the macroscopic calciﬁed tooth emerges . The process is multifactorial , with genetic , epige - netic and environmental inﬂuences . Key components are signalling pathways mediating communication between cells and complex gene regulatory networks . What is also important to note here is that 99 % of genes are present in all somatic cells and it is the epi - genetic factors which activate and deactivate different genes in different cells and tissues at speciﬁc stages in development . The linear DNA structure is modiﬁed by DNA methylation , and the DNA structural com - plexes are modiﬁed by histone acetylation . Environ - mental factors affecting development can either be systemic , such as nutrition and generalized infection , or local , such as trauma or localized infection . 23 The interactions which drive forward and balance development are multiple .

Gene action is switched on and off by epigenetic fac - tors . Cells interact with other cells and the surround - ing matrix . Tooth germs compete for space within the growing dental arches and are affected by blood sup - ply and innervation . Various developmental ﬁelds inﬂuence the dentition . A clinically relevant update of the concept of morpho - genetic ﬁelds , 24 originally postulated for the mamma - lian dentition 25 and then applied to human dentition , 26 incorporates a synthesis with the clone theory 27 and the odontogenic homeobox theory . 28 During the development of the dentition there is syn - chronized development of the innervation of each tooth and the vascular supply . Some workers have proposed that these ﬁelds are important in determining the position of tooth germ development . 29 Each tooth emerges through a continuous process that has a series of identiﬁable stages . It is initiated from a thickening of the oral epithelium at speciﬁc sites to form dental placodes . The genes , Msx1 and Osr2 , act antagonisti - cally in the patterning of the tooth morphogenetic ﬁeld by controlling the expression and spatial distribution of mesenchymal odontogenic signals along the bucco - lingual axis . 30 During early tooth morphogenesis the Dlx genes are involved in the epithelial - mesenchymal reciprocal signalling events . 31 The transition from the bud to the cap stage relates to the induction of the enamel knot . Having undergone apoptosis at the late cap stage , the primary enamel knot is no longer detected at the bell stage . Secondary enamel knots develop at the sites of the future cusps in multi - cusped teeth . Signalling molecules from the secondary enamel knots stimulate proliferation of nearby cells , leading to folding of the inner enamel epithelium and subsequent cusp formation . Next , at the bell stage , after the underlying pattern for the cusps has been established , the dentine and enamel forming cells differentiate . Dentinogenesis and amelogenesis proceed with miner - alization in the respective secreted matrices . Histodif - ferentiation for root development follows and dentine and cementum are formed . Progression over time is an important component of this complex developmental process . Each tooth pro - gresses from initiation to eruption into the oral cavity , although the length of this development process varies from tooth to tooth , particularly between those in the primary and those in the permanent dentition . Time is also a factor within each morphogenetic ﬁeld , with later developing teeth of each tooth type in humans being smaller , less complex in shape and having greater variability . In the mouse , the mandibular ﬁrst molar tooth can inhibit second molar development and an inhibitory cascade model in which initiation of posterior molars depends on the balance between in - termolar inhibition and mesenchymal activation to determine sequential molar formation has been pro - posed . 30 Another example is in mouse Evc mutants where the morphogenesis of the ﬁrst molar is strongly affected while the second molar both develops preco - ciously and is larger than controls . 32 CONSIDERATION OF DENTAL DEVELOPMENT AGAINST THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEM Self - organization and emergence Initiation and morphogenesis stages Bottom - up self - organization is present in the interac - tions of genetic and epigenetic factors that control cel - lular development and produce the emergence of soft tissue tooth germs developing at speciﬁc sites , with varying sizes and shapes , around the dental arch . At the molecular level there are interactions between genes in which the functional genes are switched on by the action of signature sequences acti - ( a ) ( b ) 20 15 10 N o d e d e g ree 5 0 Fig . 4 Small - world and scale - free networks .

The action of functional genes is also inﬂuenced by speciﬁc and general epigenetic factors , as in the regulation of dental stem cell differ - entiation by histone demethylase . In addition , general and local environmental factors affect these interac - tions . Reciprocal and sequential interactions between the ectodermal and mesenchymal cells and transcrip - tion factors are controlled by multigene signalling pathways , such as Fgf , Bmp , Shh , Wnt and Tnf . In addition to these intracellular links , extracellular effects occur , as in the modulation of the extracellular integration of cell signalling pathways by Lrp4 . An example of a motif within the larger network structure from a Sonic hedgehog pathway is illustrated in Fig . 5 . Disruption of the Shh pathway results in a variety of dental anomalies . 32 During dental morphogenesis both sex chromo - somes and intrauterine male hormones inﬂuence tooth size , possibly inﬂuencing different dimensions .

With the underlying pattern and dimensions of the cusps determined , the dentine - forming cells ( the odontoblasts ) and the enamel - forming cells ( the ameloblasts ) differentiate , controlled by additional genes not active during the pre - vious stages . Dspp expression in maturing odontoblasts is affected by Tgf - B signalling ; 32 through an epigenetic mechanism , the histone demethylase Jmjd3 inﬂuences the expression of extracellular dentine matrix . The ameloblasts secrete the enamel protein matrix to which the amelogenin gene ( Amelx ) contributes the greatest percentage of protein but the enamelin gene ( Enam ) provides the protein which controls the initiation of enamel mineralization . As mineral deposition advances the proteases , Enamelysin ( Mmp20 ) and Kallikrein ( Klk4 ) , act to remove matrix proteins and allow increased mineralization . Amelogenesis determines the ﬁnal outline size and shape of the tooth with different thicknesses of enamel on different aspects of the tooth . Non - syndromic abnormalities of enamel formation have been associated with mutations in a number of genes with different functions : secretion and later removal of enamel matrix proteins ( AMELX , ENAM , C4orf26 , MMP20 , KLK4 ) ; intracellular activ - ity ( FAM83H , WDR72 ) ; transmembrane activity ( SLC24A4 , COL17A1 ) and basement membrane activ - ity ( LAMA3 , LAMB3 ) . 35 Thus , amelogenesis exhibits the features of a motif cluster in a complex network . Multitasking Multitasking occurs during dental development as dif - ferent genetic pathways act simultaneously and in par - allel . Further , certain functional genes and signalling pathways act reiteratively controlling different stages of development , e . g . p21 , Msx2 , Lef1 , in ectoderm , Msx1 , Barx1 , Dlx1 - 2 , Pax9 , in mesenchyme , and Bmp , Fgf , Shh , Wnt as signalling pathways between these two tissues from the initiation stage to the end of mor - phogenesis . 23 Multitasking is also seen later during the differentiation phase in enamel as simultaneous miner - alization increases and enamel proteins undergo break - down and removal , allowing mineralization to advance . The onset of enamel formation involves fenes - tration of the basement membrane , extension of the ameloblast process into irregularities on the pre - dentine surface and expression of enamel proteins . Coordinated replacement of the hemidesmosome / basement mem - brane complexes with the mineralization front appara - tus is critical for normal function . 35 Summary of evidence for self - organization , bottom - up emergence and multitasking From interactions at the lower level , i . e . molecular , cel - lular and developmental soft tissue interactions , the macroscopic mineralized teeth emerge at the higher level . The individual teeth are organized under the inﬂuence of morphogenetic ﬁelds into spatially distributed groups to form an integrated , effective , functioning system . The mature individual teeth and the dentition bear no resemblance to the earlier compo - nents from which they have emerged by self - organiza - tion . Enamel formation during dental formation shows evidence of self - organization , emergence and multitask - ing with different genes and types of cell products Wnt Shh Ptch1 Smo Gli 3 Gli 1 - 3 activators IFT complexes Requires intact primary cilia Intraflagellar transport complexes Fgf Fig . 5 A subgraph constructed from a sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) pathway . In signal receiving cells , secreted Shh protein binds to the receptor Patched 1 ( Ptch1 ) , and activates Smoothed ( Smo ) , a transmembrane pro - tein . Smoothed prevents proteolytic processing of the transcription factor Gli3 into its repressor form . Gli activators now regulate the transcription of Shh pathway downstream genes that include Ptch 1 and Gli1 . 41 This pathway requires cells to have intact primary cilia projecting from their surfaces . Cilia formation and maintenance require mobilization of pro - teins at the tip and base of the cilia by intra ﬂ agellar transport ( IFT ) com - plexes . IFT acts downstream of Ptch1 and Smo , with one of its components restricting the Shh pathway . 42 © 2014 Australian Dental Association 19 General and craniofacial development are complex adaptive processes essential to the process orchestrated by the ameloblasts . The multitasking seen during odontogenesis is charac - teristic of a complex adaptive system . Self - adaptation Three further characteristics of complex systems are diversity , critical phases and robustness . Diversity Self - adaptation is seen in the diversity of the denti - tions which are present in different species . This diver - sity arises not so much from different numbers or types of genes , as these are similar in the different spe - cies , but rather from the epigenetic switches used to turn genes on and off . Diversity also occurs within species , as seen in the variation in human tooth num - ber , size , shape and mineralization . This range of vari - ation allows adaptation to different masticatory demands and to changes of the skeletal base in which the dentition develops and functions . Substantial dif - ferences have been shown between four human ethnic groups in mesiodistal crown dimensions and also in the relative sizes of different tooth types . 36 Interaction between the soft tissue tooth germs as they are developing adds to the diversity of the form - ing teeth . Within the morphogenetic ﬁelds , the later forming teeth are more variable , with some evidence from the murine dentition that the dimensions of the earlier forming teeth inﬂuence the size of later form - ing teeth , and even whether a supernumerary tooth will develop . 37 Critical phases There are a series of critical phases during dental devel - opment which determine whether a mature tooth will be formed and , if it is formed , whether it will have a developmental defect or not . Transcription factors in the Msx , Dlx and Lhx families are necessary for both initiation of the tooth germ and for progression from the initiation stage into morphogenesis . 23 If progression does not occur at a critical phase , the tooth germ may undergo apoptosis . During the differentiation stage , partial or complete failure in the secretion of enamel matrix proteins leads to hypoplastic enamel defects in the mature tooth of varying types and severity . Later , in amelogenesis , failure to remove the secreted matrix proteins leads to hypomineralization defects of varying degrees . Robustness Although it incorporates many detailed interactions with critical phases , another aspect of dental develop - ment is the robustness of the process and the relative efﬁciency of the outcome , even with variations and mild or moderate anomalies . During development , when a gene has a mutation which decreases or pre - vents its function , compensation may sometimes occur between different members of the same gene family , e . g . other members of the MSX family may be acti - vated when a mutation has decreased the function of one of them . 34 In the mature dentition , adequate mas - tication is possible with some variation in tooth num - ber , size and shape and in the presence of mild or moderate mineralization defects . Summary of evidence for self - adaptation Diversity is seen in the markedly different dentitions present in different species of animals . Within species , dental variations also allow adaptation to different environmental challenges . Dental development has mul - tiple critical phases , interference with which can lead to a range of dental variations . Even so , the process and outcome have a considerable degree of robustness . Statistical models and the dentition In this section evidence is presented that the ﬁndings from studies of the dentition are compatible with the statistical models characteristic of complex adaptive systems . Random network model From many measurement studies of different popula - tions , the mesiodistal and buccolingual crown dimen - sions of teeth have been found to have a normal distribution with the range of values described by a mean value and standard deviation . 38 Threshold model Brook 38 proposed such a model based on the normal distribution of tooth size with thresholds at the lower end describing microdontia and hypodontia and at the upper end describing megadontia and supernumerary teeth . Females tend to have smaller teeth and a higher frequency of hypodontia and microdontia ; males tend to have larger teeth and a higher frequency of mega - dontia and supernumeraries . The subsequent genetic and histogenetic ﬁndings of some of the mechanisms by which these anomalies arise at critical phases dur - ing development have provided the developmental rationale for this model which was based on statistical analysis of clinical and epidemiological ﬁndings . Here the model is developed to include more recent evi - dence that changes in shape are associated with changes in size ( Fig . 6 ) . 20 © 2014 Australian Dental Association AH Brook et al . Scale - free network model In a study of upper incisor teeth , multiple dimensions were measured on dental study models using 2D image analysis and customized software . When the frequen - cies of the factors in these measurements were plotted a power law distribution was found ( Figs . 2 and 4b ) . 39 Hierarchical network model Each individual entity , e . g . gene , is a node and interacts with one or more other nodes . A few nodes , such as the signalling molecules , have multiple connections to other nodes and act as hubs . The hub and the nodes connected to it form a module . Such modules can be joined together by ‘super hubs’ to form a hierarchical model . 11 The repeated actions of a few genes during dental development suggest this type of model may be valuable in further studies of odontogenesis ( Fig . 7 ) . Gene regulation model Salazar - Cuidad and Jernvall 40 developed a gene net - work model to account for the development of mam - malian teeth . The model depicts tooth development from the cap stage to the early bell stage and success - fully reproduces the crown morphologies , the interme - diate stages including the correct temporal spacing between them , and the patterns of expression of known genes . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK The dentition , both in development and its mature form , has the general characteristics of a self - organizing and self - adaptive complex system . This exploration provides the foundation for future investi - gations of this model . As a basis for these computa - tional studies there are published genetic databases , extensive histogenetic investigations and accurate mac - roscopic phenotyping data from 2D and 3D measure - ment studies . Thus , the dentition is a valuable model for investigating the control of general development and the causes of developmental abnormalities . The stages of development are accessible through animal models and the macroscopic outcomes can be pheno - typed accurately and in detail in both modern and ancient populations . Moreover , the same genes , the same epigenetic and environmental inﬂuences and sim - ilar mechanisms are present during development , whether of the dentition or other body systems .
