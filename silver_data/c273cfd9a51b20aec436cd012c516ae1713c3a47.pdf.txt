This pattern arises when uniform fields of progenitor cells diversify their molecular fate while adopting higher - order structure . Using the nascent skin of the developing chicken embryo as a model system , we find that morphological and molecular symmetries are simultaneously broken by an emergent process of cellular self - organization . The key initiators of heterogeneity are dermal progenitors , which spontaneously aggregate through contractility - driven cellular pulling . Concurrently , this dermal cell aggregation triggers the mechanosensitive activation of b - catenin in adjacent epidermal cells , initiating the follicle gene expression program . Taken together , this mechanism provides a means of integrating mechanical and molecular perspectives of organ formation . D uring skin organogenesis , the structures thatproducehairinmammalsandfeathersinbirds , termedfollicles , emergeinaspaced array . Before follicle formation in amniotes , the embryonic skin consists of a sheet of epithelialcellsattached toaslab of mesenchymal cells via a basement membrane ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Over the course of 2 days , this uniform tissue bi - layer transitions into one studded with regularly spaced , multicellular aggregates , each with an activated follicle primordium gene expression program ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) .

How this leap in complexity is reproducibly initiated remains un - solved ( 1 , 2 ) . Previous studies have posited that molecular patterns arise first and then dictate differential cell behaviors that cause changes in tissue struc - ture ( 3 , 4 ) . This has led to the inference that fol - licleinitiation isdependenton theestablishment of a molecular prepattern . We began to question this model when we discovered that , in the avian skin , initialfolliclefatemarkers , nuclear b - catenin ( amasterregulator of the follicle gene expression program ) ( 5 ) and downstream expression of bmp2 and fgf10 , accompany rather than precede the earliest architectural changes of the follicle ( Fig . 1B and fig . S1 ) . At day 7 of development ( E7 ) , before the detection of these molecular markers , emerging follicles become detectable as stacked epithelial cells overlying aggregated mesenchyme ( fig . S2 ) . To confirm that initiation of structural changes does not rely on b - catenin activation , we promoted b - catenin degradation by culturing re - constituted skin explants before aggregation in XAV939 , which stimulates b - catenin degradation ( see the supplementary materials ) ( 6 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Although samples cultured in XAV939 lack nu - clear b - catenin and bmp2 expression , they are capable of forming spaced aggregates compa - rable to the follicle structure ( Fig . 1C ) . Given that follicle structures are capable of emergingintheabsenceof b - cateninactivation , we investigatedthedriverofthesestructuralchanges . We were guided by the observation that , as fol - licles emerge , the primordium basement mem - branebecomesincreasinglyarched , resemblinga RESEARCH Shyer et al . , Science 357 , 811 – 815 ( 2017 ) 25 August 2017 1 of 5 1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , Berkeley , CA , USA . 2 Department of Genetics , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA . 3 Department of Bioengineering , University of California , Berkeley , Berkeley , CA , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Corresponding author .

Previous mechanical studies have shown thatsurfacebuckling can be caused bycom - pression of a stiff film on an elastic substrate ( 7 ) . Given these observations , and morerecentwork highlighting the importance of a mechanical view ( 8 – 10 ) , webegantoexploreamechanismwhereby follicle structure is initiated by compression . We first confirmed that such forces were sufficient to generate the architecture observed in follicles . To do so , we exploited the inherent tension pres - ent throughout the embryonic skin , which is evidenced by rapid shrinkage when a skin sam - ple is excised ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . When the dorsal region of E6 skin is excised from the embryo and subjected to compression as tension is relieved , the entire tissue adopts an architectural profile akin to primordia , with bunched epithelial cells , aggregated mesenchyme , and a buckled mem - brane ( Fig . 2 , C to E ) . We next determined whether compression stems from cellular behaviors in the dermis or epidermis by separating these layers and moni - toring basement membrane buckling as a marker of compression . Only the dermis forced the base - ment membrane to buckle and the epidermis to bunch , indicating that the dermal layer is the source of compression ( Fig . 2 , F to I ) . We there - fore hypothesized thatthe change in follicle struc - ture is initiated by mechanical cross - talk whereby the dermal layer compresses the epidermal layer during follicle formation . Having shown via tissue excision that ectopi - callygenerated dermalcompression applied over the scale of minutes can simulate follicle mor - phology , we sought to articulate the native forces within the dermis that bring about follicle ag - gregation on the scale of hours . We ruled out forces generated from local proliferation because differential cell division does not occur before primordium formation ( 11 ) . Instead , we focused on cellular rearrangement within the dermis as a potential mechanism of aggregation . Spontane - ous mesenchymal cell aggregation has been ob - served in vitro when dissociated mesenchymal cells are cultured at high density ( 1 , 12 , 13 ) . The keydriversof such spaced aggregation have been formalized in several theoretical models ( 14 – 17 ) . Central to these models is cellular contractility within a rigid context . Mesenchymal cells have an intrinsic potential to aggregate , and , as they do so , they amplify their potential to draw in ad - ditional cells . Thus , small , random fluctuations in cell density can be amplified to form larger aggregates as cells exert traction on each other . This propensity for cellular aggregation must be resisted by surrounding material ( with stiffness being a major component of resistance ) , which inhibits the formation of a single , large aggregate but permits a dispersed array . We first tested for the necessity of an ap - propriately rigid context to promote the forma - tion of spaced aggregates , as well as the impact that variation of stiffness could have on aggre - gate formation . We varied stiffness conditions using an ex vivo culture assay . When cultured atop a membrane in pilot experiments , spaced aggregates formed after 48 hours in culture ( Fig . 3A and fig . S3 ) . However , when explants were cultured freely floating , they underwent extreme contraction and subsequently failed to form a pattern , underscoring the need for a stiff culture environment ( fig . S3 ) . To investigate whether varying stiffness could modify aggregate pattern , we cultured skin explants on fibronectin - coated , polyacrylamide gels of progressive stiffness .

Conversely , culture on the stiffest gel resulted in thin , stretched skin with either sparse or no pat - tern ( Fig . 3A ) . At intermediate stiffness , however , explants formed aggregates where spacing be - tween aggregates increases as a function of stiff - ness ( Fig . 3 , A to D ) . We then tested the necessity of cellular con - tractility for aggregate formation , as well as the effect of varying contractility on pattern . Explants were cultured on a membrane or on collagen gels seeded with beads for detecting gel deformation . Tissues treated with high levels of blebbistatin , a myosin II inhibitor ( 18 , 19 ) , showed no increase in subadjacent gel bead density , indicating an ef - fective pharmacological ablation of cellular con - tractility ( fig . S4 ) . Thislossofcontractilityresulted inanabnormallylarge , thintissueandanabsence of any aggregate pattern ( Fig . 3E ) . We also tested an independent inhibitor of myosin II activity , Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor Y27632 , andobservedsimilardisruptionofpattern formation ( fig . S5 ) . In contrast , tissues treated with high levels of calyculin A , a myosin II ac - tivator ( 20 ) , significantly increased subadjacent collagen gel bead density , indicating an effective pharmacological augmentation of cellular con - tractility ( fig . S4 ) . Increased contractility led to decreased tissue surface area and increased thickness , as well as the elimination of pattern ( Fig . 3E ) . To rule out the possibility that the ef - fects observed when myosin II activity was al - tered were through changes in cell division , we confirmed that proliferation was not altered by these drugs ( fig . S6 ) . Strikingly , between the ex - tremes of traction , we find that the sizing of pri - mordia was progressively tuned ( Fig . 3A ) . Even with a uniform starting area , the final number of primordia per sample increased at lower con - tractility and decreased at higher contractility , demonstrating that perturbing contractility does not result in the simple scaling of a bud pre - pattern ( Fig . 3 , E to H ) .

Thus , follicles emerge through a mechanical instability that spontaneously generates an in - crease in morphological complexity . Of note , this mechanism bears resemblance to Alan Turing ’ s models of chemical patterning , in which local activation competes against long - range inhibi - tion ( 21 ) . However , in this context , the key unit of pattern occurs at the cellular level and not the molecular . Although this model of mesenchymal cell gen - eration of mechanical instability provides an ac - count of how follicle structure is initiated , it alone does not account for how changes in gene ex - pression are triggered . We considered a mecha - nism whereby b - catenin in epithelial cells acts as a sensor of mechanical compression triggered by dermal cell aggregation . This putative mecha - nism is based on three reinforcing lines of evi - dence . First , it has been established that nuclear b - catenin in the epidermis is the earliest known regulator of primordium - specific gene expression ( 5 ) . Second , b - catenin has been shown to serve as a sensor and transducer of mechanical stimulus ininvertebrateembryosandtumors ( 22 , 23 ) . Third , experiments presented above argue that the der - mal layer focally compresses overlying epithelial cells through mechanical cross - talk , suggesting a direct mechanical trigger . To show that b - catenin nuclear localization is dependent on dermal compression , we pharma - cologically manipulated cellular contractility in cultured skin explants . Very high levels of con - tractility led to nuclear b - catenin across the en - tire epithelium , indicating that the entire bud adopted a follicle gene expression program ( Fig . 4A ) . Conversely , under very low levels of contrac - tility , no nuclear b - catenin was observed across the epidermis ( Fig . 4A ) . At intermediate levels of traction , when primordia size is tuned , nuclear b - catenin adjusted in a lock - step manner with dermalaggregation ( fig . S7 ) . Inparalleltochanges in contractility , analogous nuclear b - catenin re - sponses were observed when tissue mechanics were manipulated through substrate stiffness ( fig . S8 ) . To determine the immediacy of b - catenin re - sponse to physical compression , we cultured ex - cised skin freely floating in media to allow for rapid contraction on the order of hours . In con - tracted tissues , nuclear b - catenin was observed in the epidermis after just 2 hours , suggesting a direct response at the posttranscriptional level ( fig . S9 ) . In control conditions , when explants were cultured attached to the body to prevent tissue contraction , no nuclear b - catenin was ob - served in the epithelium ( fig . S9 ) . To further confirm the mechanical activation of b - catenin , we assayed for Y654 phosphoryl - ation . Functionally , this Src kinase – dependent modification allows for b - catenin release from E - cadherin at the membrane and for subsequent translocation into the nucleus ( 24 , 25 ) . As pre - dicted , Y654 staining was only observed in form - ing primordia ( fig . S10 ) . Tissue with ectopically high compression showed broad Y654 staining , whereas tissue with ablated compression showed none ( figs . S10 and S11 ) . Y654 staining was also lost when tissues were cultured in the presence of SKI - 1 , an inhibitor of Src kinase activity , con - firming the Src - dependent nature of this phos - phorylation in the skin ( fig . S11 ) . Finally , to confirm that this mechanical acti - vation of b - catenin leads to activation of the downstream follicle gene expression program , we assayed expression of bmp2 . Indeed , bmp2 was also broadly expressed across the epidermis in highly contracted samples , and no bmp2 ex - pression was seen in the uncompressed epider - mis ( Fig . 4B ) . This loss of expression was rescued through the addition of BIO ( 6 - bromoindirubin - 3 ′ - oxime ) to inhibit cytosolic degradation of b - catenin ( fig . S10 ) . Together , these results dem - onstrate that mechanically triggered movement of b - catenin to the nucleus is sufficient to initiate the primordia gene expression program . Here , weidentifykeyinitiatorsof folliclestruc - ture and fate in the skin . Our findings argue that the mechanics of cellular self - organization and structural rearrangement are critical not only for creating follicle shape but also for triggering the follicle gene expression program . Critically , tissue symmetry is broken mechanically and then directly conveyed to the genome via b - catenin mechanosensation . We propose that a similar mechanism could be at play in other contexts Shyer et al . , Science 357 , 811 – 815 ( 2017 ) 25 August 2017 4 of 5 control 25uM bleb β - c a t β - c a t ( z oo m ) 25nM CA D AP I T R A C T I O N R ES I S T A NC E membrane nucleus MANY NONE ONE Uniform traction when adequately resisted leads to an array of aggregates [ field of dermal cells from above ] Dermis COMPRESSES epidermis force causes translocation of β - catenin [ cross - section of tissue bilayer ] b m p2 Fig . 4 .

( C ) Model : A field of dense , contractile dermal cells will resolve into many spaced aggregates if cell contractility is met with resistance . If resistance is too low ( top ) or too high ( bottom ) , cells will be unable to pull into any aggregates or collapse into a single aggregate , respectively . Dermal cell aggregation compresses the adjacent epidermis focally , bunching the epidermal cells of each primordium . Compression of the epidermis is sensed through the protein b - catenin , which responds to this force by moving to the nucleus .
