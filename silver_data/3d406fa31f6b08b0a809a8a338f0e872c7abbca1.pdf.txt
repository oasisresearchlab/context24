Phase ﬁeld modeling and computation of vesicle growth or shrinkage Xiaoxia Tang ∗ Shuwang Li † John S . Lowengrub ‡ Steven M . Wise § September 29 , 2022 Abstract We present a phase ﬁeld model for vesicle growth or shrinkage induced by an osmotic pressure due to a chemical potential gradient . The model consists of an Allen - Cahn equation describing the evolution of phase ﬁeld and a Cahn - Hilliard equation describing the evolution of concentration ﬁeld . We establish control conditions for vesicle growth or shrinkage via a common tangent construction . During the membrane deformation , the model ensures total mass conservation and satisﬁes surface area constraint . We develop a nonlinear numerical scheme , a combination of nonlinear Gauss - Seidel relaxation operator and a V - cycles multigrid solver , for computing equilibrium shapes of a 2D vesicle . Convergence tests conﬁrm an O ( t + h 2 ) accuracy . Numerical results reveal that the diﬀuse interface model captures the main feature of dynamics : for a growing vesicle , there exist circle - like equilibrium shapes if the concentration diﬀerence across the membrane and the initial osmotic pressure are large enough ; while for a shrinking vesicle , there exists a rich collection of ﬁnger - like equilibrium morphologies .

Lipid bilayers are the basic structural component of biological membranes . It is a semipermeable barrier to most solutes , including ions , proteins and other molecules . In an aqueous environment , a bilayer lipid membrane forms a vesicle ( a closed bio - membrane containing ﬂuid ) to reduce the energy of the hydrophobic edges . Because of their relatively simple structure , vesicles are often used as a model system for studying fundamental physics underlying complicated biological systems such as cells and microcapsules . In addition , vesicles have also been used as building blocks to engineer artiﬁcial cells , e . g . biochemical microreactors operating in physiological environments [ 1 ] . Osmosis usually refers to the net movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane driven by a diﬀerence in concentration of solute on either side [ 2 , 3 ] . Tonicity is another concept from osmosis . It is operationally deﬁned as the ability of a solution to shrink or swell speciﬁed cells . Hypotonicity describes any medium with a suﬃciently low concentration of solutes to drive water to move into a cell due to osmosis . Hypertonicity describes any medium with a suﬃciently high concentration of solutes to drive water to move out of a cell due to osmosis [ 2 , 4 ] . In Figure 1 , we show response of a human red blood cell to changes in tonicity ∗ Department of Applied Mathematics , Illinois Institute of Technology , Chicago , IL 60616 ( xtang15 @ hawk . iit . edu ) † Department of Applied Mathematics , Illinois Institute of Technology , Chicago , IL 60616 ( sli @ math . iit . edu ) ‡ Department of Mathematics , The University of California , Irvine , CA 92697 ( jlowengr @ uci . edu ) § Corresponding author : Department of Mathematics , The University of Tennessee , Knoxville , TN 37996 ( swise1 @ utk . edu ) 1 a r X i v : 2209 . 13690v1 [ m a t h .

Clearly , hypertonic solutions shrink cells , hypotonic solutions increase cell volume , and isotonic solutions neither swell nor shrink the cell . Motivated by these volume changes , in this paper , we develop a mathematical model to simulate the eﬀects of growth or shrinkage coming from the concentration gradient .

The cell swells , shrinks or stays normal as water moves into or out of the cell down its concentration gradient in hypotonic , hypertonic , or isotonic solutions .

Mathematical modeling of membrane deformation has become an important area of research in biological and industrial system for a long time . At the continuum level , the mathematical description of vesicle conformation and deformation is a highly nonlinear , nonlocal moving boundary problem where the bilayer membrane serves as the moving boundary . Sharp interface models have been implemented to simulate the motion of vesicles in ﬂuids [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] . For example , nonlinear wrinkling dynamics of a vesicle in an extensional ﬂow and tumbling mechanism of two - dimensional vesicles in a shear ﬂow are studied in [ 16 , 17 ] . Sharp interface models can satisfy the interface and inextensibility conditions exactly . That is , the volume enclosed by membrane is automatically conserved for an incompressible ﬂuid . The deformation based on the net mass transfer ( gain or loss ) across the membrane has not been considered . There are also sharp interface models of membrane deformation based on osmosis and diﬀusion [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ] . For example , boundary integral simulations are used to investigate the eﬀects of water permeability on the hydrodynamics of an inextensible membrane under a mechanical load in [ 25 ] . An immersed boundary method [ 26 ] for modeling convection and diﬀusion of mass transfer through porous membranes under large deformations is proposed in a recent work [ 24 ] . Phase ﬁeld models have also been used to simulate the equilibrium conﬁgurations and the dynamics of vesicles [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ] . It is well known that the phase ﬁeld method is based on a diﬀusive interface approximation of a sharp interface , and treats the interface as a continuous but with steep change of properties of the two ﬂuids by introducing a phase variable deﬁned in the whole computational domain . That is , the interface is expressed by a thin internal transition layer of phase ﬁeld [ 31 , 32 ] . The phase ﬁeld approach exhibits advantages in its simplicity in model formulation , where the interface problem is posed as a reaction - diﬀusion equation deﬁned on the whole domain without requiring special treatment at the interface , thus ease of numerical implementation . Updating the interface position without explicitly tracking the interface is another attractive numerical feature of the phase ﬁeld model [ 33 , 32 , 34 ] . The well known Allen - Cahn ( AC ) and Cahn - Hilliard ( CH ) equations are two gradient ﬂow type PDEs describing the process of phase separation of a binary mixture , while the ﬁeld variable is conserved in CH , but non - conserved in AC [ 31 , 35 , 36 ] . All spontaneous processes are accompanied by a decrease in free energy of the system . In this paper , we develop a phase ﬁeld model to simulate vesicle growth or shrinkage based on osmotic pressure , which arises due to a chemical potential gradient . In particular , we determine control conditions for 2 growth and shrinkage via a common tangent construction . We simulate the growth and shrinkage eﬀects subject to total mass conservation and surface area constraint , while allowing the mass exchange inside and outside the vesicle . Considering surface bending energy , osmotic pressure energy , and surface area constraint in addition to the surface energy used in the classical AC and CH equations , we derive an Allen - Cahn equation describing the evolution of phase ﬁeld and a Cahn - Hilliard equation describing the evolution of concentration ﬁeld . The numerical computing and analysis are close to the method used in [ 37 ] . We solve the problem by a nonlinear multigrid method [ 38 , 39 , 40 ] , which is a combination of nonlinear Gauss - Seidel relaxation operator and V - cycles multigrid solver . Speciﬁcally , at each time step we ﬁrst need a nonlinear Gauss - Seidel smoothing operator , then use this smoothing operator on each hierarchical grid to get a better approximation . We demon - strate the nearly optimal complexity of the multigrid solver and convergence of the scheme , which is of ﬁrst order in time and second order in space . Numerical results reveal that for a growing vesicle , there exist circle - like equilibrium shapes if the concentration diﬀerence across the membrane and the initial osmotic pressure are large enough ; while for a shrinking vesicle , there exists a rich collection of ﬁnger - like equilibrium morphologies . This paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we deﬁne the model equations and analyse conditions for vesicle growth or shrinkage by common tangent construction . In Section 3 , the numerical scheme of the system and nonlinear multigrid algorithm are presented . Numerical results are given in Section 4 . 2 Model Formulation 2 . 1 Evolution Equations We start by deﬁning a Helmholtz free energy . Let Ω ⊂ R 2 . The functions φ , ψ : Ω → R are the phase ﬁelds ( order parameters ) describing the vesicle shape and the concentration of ionic ﬂuid occupying the volume Ω , respectively . { x : φ ( x ) = 0 } determines the location of the membrane , while { x : φ ( x ) = 1 } represents the interior phase ( inside the vesicle ) , and { x : φ ( x ) = − 1 } represents the exterior phase ( outside the vesicle ) . We consider the following free energy densities [ 41 , 31 , 42 ] : f surf ( φ , ∇ φ ) : = 3 √ 2 4 (cid:18) 1 εg ( φ ) + ε 2 | ∇ φ | 2 (cid:19) , ( 2 . 1 ) f bend ( φ , ∆ φ ) : = 3 √ 2 16 ε (cid:18) 1 εg (cid:48) ( φ ) − ε ∆ φ (cid:19) 2 , ( 2 . 2 ) f osm ( φ , ψ ) : = 1 + p ( φ ) 2 f in ( ψ ) + 1 − p ( φ ) 2 f out ( ψ ) , ( 2 . 3 ) where g is the standard double - well function g ( φ ) = 14 (cid:0) φ 2 − 1 (cid:1) 2 . ε is a small positive constant characterizing the thickness of the diﬀuse interface . f in ( ψ ) and f out ( ψ ) are quadratic functions f in ( ψ ) : = γ in 2 ( ψ − ψ in ) 2 + β in and f out ( ψ ) : = γ out 2 ( ψ − ψ out ) 2 + β out , ( 2 . 4 ) where γ in , ψ in , β in , γ out , ψ out , β out are assumed to be positive parameters . p is an interpolation function satisfying p ( 1 ) = 1 ( interior phase ) and p ( − 1 ) = − 1 ( exterior phase ) and p (cid:48) ( − 1 ) = p (cid:48) ( 1 ) = 0 as well . Now , we deﬁne free energies F surf : = (cid:90) Ω γ surf f surf ( φ , ∇ φ ) d x , ( 2 . 5 ) F bend : = (cid:90) Ω γ bend f bend ( φ , ∆ φ ) d x , ( 2 . 6 ) F area : = γ area 2 (cid:18)(cid:90) Ω f surf ( φ , ∇ φ ) d x − A (cid:19) 2 , ( 2 . 7 ) F osm : = (cid:90) Ω f osm ( φ , ψ ) d x . ( 2 . 8 ) 3 Note that F surf is related to the surface area of the vesicle , and F bend is the surface bending energy . A is the initial surface area of the vesicle , and F area is the penalty term to numerically enforce the surface area constraint , since the surface area should remain unchanged for a vesicle with ﬁxed amount of lipids . γ surf , γ bend , γ area > 0 . F osm describes the osmotic energy arises in the mixture ﬂuids with diﬀerent concentrations . The Helmholtz free energy is thus deﬁned as F [ φ , ψ ] = F surf [ φ ] + F bend [ φ ] + F area [ φ ] + F osm [ φ , ψ ] . ( 2 . 9 ) After energy variation , the dynamic equations read ∂ t φ = − M φ µ , ( 2 . 10 ) µ = δ φ F , ( 2 . 11 ) ∂ t ψ = ∇ · ( M ψ ( φ ) ∇ ν ) , ( 2 . 12 ) ν = δ ψ F , ( 2 . 13 ) where the phase variable φ is non - conserved and satisﬁes an Allen - Cahn equation , while the variable ψ is conserved and satisﬁes a Cahn - Hilliard mass conservation equation . We take homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on ∂ Ω . Here the mobility M φ > 0 is a constant and M ψ ( φ ) > 0 is a positive function of φ . µ and ν are the chemical potentials µ = γ surf 3 √ 2 4 ω + γ bend 3 √ 2 8 (cid:16) ω ε 2 g (cid:48)(cid:48) ( φ ) − ∆ ω (cid:17) + γ area (cid:18)(cid:90) Ω f surf ( φ , ∇ φ ) d x − A (cid:19) 3 √ 2 4 ω + p (cid:48) ( φ ) 2 (cid:0) f in ( ψ ) − f out ( ψ ) (cid:1) , ( 2 . 14 ) ω = 1 εg (cid:48) ( φ ) − ε ∆ φ , ( 2 . 15 ) ν = 1 + p ( φ ) 2 · df in dψ ( ψ ) + 1 − p ( φ ) 2 · df out dψ ( ψ ) . ( 2 . 16 ) It is reasonable to assume that the mobility for ψ degenerates in the interfacial region , since mass ﬂow is limited to small channels in the vesicle membrane . Therefore , we assume that M ψ ( φ ) = 1 − M 0 ( φ 2 − 1 ) 2 , for some M 0 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , ( 2 . 17 ) which follows that M ψ ≥ 1 − M 0 > 0 . The system ( 2 . 10 ) − ( 2 . 13 ) is energy dissipative , and the dissipation rate is d t F = (cid:90) Ω { δF φ ∂ t φ + δF ψ ∂ t ψ } d x = (cid:90) Ω { µ∂ t φ + ν∂ t ψ } d x = (cid:90) Ω { µ ( − M φ µ ) + ν ( ∇ · ( M ψ ∇ ν ) ) } d x = (cid:90) Ω (cid:8) − M φ | µ | 2 − M ψ | ∇ ν | 2 (cid:9) d x ≤ 0 Next , we analyse the conditions for vesicle growth or shrinkage via the common tangent construction based on the osmotic free energy . 4 ψ f in ( ψ ) f out ( ψ ) ψ in (cid:63) ψ out (cid:63) Figure 2 : Typical common tangent connection for the free energy densities for the interior f in ( ψ ) ( left ) and exterior f out ( ψ ) ( right ) ( 2 . 4 ) phases . The vesicle will grow or shrink according to the initial ( spatially uniform ) states for ψ inside and outside the vesicle . Suppose that ψ in (cid:63) and ψ out (cid:63) are the values of ψ where the common tangent touches the respective free energy densities f in ( ψ ) ( left ) and f out ( ψ ) ( right ) . 5 2 . 2 Conditions for Growth or Shrinkage Suppose that ψ in (cid:63) and ψ out (cid:63) are the equilibrium concentration values for the interior and exterior regions obtained via the common tangent construction [ 34 , 43 ] , and let us further assume that 0 ≤ ψ in (cid:63) < ψ out (cid:63) ≤ 1 , ( 2 . 18 ) as shown in Figure 2 . Now , suppose that we choose the following initial conditions for ψ : ψ in ( t = 0 ) = : ψ in0 < ψ in (cid:63) and ψ out ( t = 0 ) = : ψ out0 = ψ out (cid:63) . ( 2 . 19 ) This is the case that is illustrated in Figure 3 . The exterior phase is at its bulk equilibrium value , but the interior phase is not . The osmotic free energy is decreased as the concentration in the interior region goes up from the initial value ψ in0 to the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) . Therefore mass will ﬂow in until a global equilibrium is attained . In this case , the mass will be transferred into the interior region ( the volume of the vesicle will increase ) , though its surface area will remain unchanged . x x int0 x intﬁnal ψ in0 ψ in (cid:63) ψ out0 = ψ out (cid:63) inner phase outer phase Figure 3 : An example of volumetric growth . The black dashed regions show the initial state , and the red shows the ﬁnal state . x int0 is the initial position of the interface ; x intﬁnal is the position of the interface after global equilibrium is attained . The total mass is conserved ; mass from the black region is transferred into the red region . The interface moves to the right , and the concentration in the inner phase increases . The shrinkage case is analogous and is illustrated in Figure 4 . Suppose the initial conditions for this case are ψ in ( t = 0 ) = : ψ in0 > ψ in (cid:63) and ψ out ( t = 0 ) = : ψ out0 = ψ out (cid:63) . ( 2 . 20 ) In this case , the mass will be transferred into the exterior region , and the interior region will shrink ( the volume of the vesicle decreases with constant surface area ) as the osmotic free energy decreasing , while the concentration in the interior region decreases from its initial value ψ in0 to the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) . 3 Numerical Method In this section , we use a backward - time central - space method for discretization to get a semi - implicit numer - ical scheme , then solve the discrete system by a nonlinear Full Approximation Scheme ( FAS ) multigrid method , which is a combination of nonlinear Gauss - Seidel relaxation operator and V - cycles multigrid solver . 6 x x intﬁnal x int0 ψ in0 ψ in (cid:63) ψ out0 = ψ out (cid:63) inner phase outer phase Figure 4 : An example of volumetric shrinkage .

The mass is conserved ; mass from the black region is transferred into the red region . The interface moves to the left and the concentration in the inner phase decreases . 3 . 1 Discretization of Time We propose the following time - discrete , space - continuous scheme of ( 2 . 10 ) - ( 2 . 13 ) φ k + 1 − φ k = − sM φ µ k + 1 , ( 3 . 1 ) µ k + 1 = γ 1 ω k + 1 + γ 2 (cid:18) ω k + 1 ε 2 g (cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) − ∆ ω k + 1 (cid:19) + γ 3 (cid:0) B k − A (cid:1) ω k + 1 + p (cid:48) (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) f in (cid:0) ψ k (cid:1) − f out (cid:0) ψ k (cid:1)(cid:3) , ( 3 . 2 ) ω k + 1 = 1 εg (cid:48) ( φ k + 1 ) − ε ∆ φ k + 1 , ( 3 . 3 ) ψ k + 1 − ψ k = s ∇ · (cid:0) M ψ ( φ k ) ∇ ν k + 1 (cid:1) , ( 3 . 4 ) ν k + 1 = 1 + p (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) 2 df in dψ (cid:0) ψ k + 1 (cid:1) + 1 − p (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) 2 df out dψ (cid:0) ψ k + 1 (cid:1) , ( 3 . 5 ) where s is the time step , γ 1 = γ surf · 3 √ 24 , γ 2 = γ bend · 3 √ 28 , γ 3 = γ area 3 √ 24 , B k = (cid:82) Ω f surf (cid:0) φ k , ∇ φ k (cid:1) dx , and ∂ n φ k + 1 = ∂ n µ k + 1 = ∂ n ω k + 1 = ∂ n ψ k + 1 = ∂ n ν k + 1 = 0 on ∂ Ω . 3 . 2 Discretization of Two - Dimensional Space 3 . 2 . 1 Notations and Deﬁnitions Here we follow the notations and deﬁnitions of grid functions and diﬀerence operators used in [ 37 ] . Consider Ω = ( 0 , L x ) × ( 0 , L y ) ⊂ R 2 , with L x = m · h , L y = n · h , where h > 0 is the spatial resolution and m , n are 7 positive integers . First , let’s denote C m = (cid:26)(cid:18) i − 1 2 (cid:19) · h | i = 1 , . . . , m (cid:27) , ( 3 . 6 ) C ¯ m = (cid:26)(cid:18) i − 1 2 (cid:19) · h | i = 0 , . . . , m + 1 (cid:27) , ( 3 . 7 ) E m = { i · h | i = 0 , . . . , m } . ( 3 . 8 ) C m and C ¯ m are sets of cell - centered points of the interval [ 0 , L x ] . The two points in C ¯ m \ C m are called ghost points . The elements of E m are called edge - centered points of [ 0 , L x ] . Analogously , C n and C ¯ n con - tain the cell - centered points of [ 0 , L y ] , and E n is a uniform partition of [ 0 , L y ] of size n . We will consider cell - centered points as domain of our discretized functions , and need the notations of edge - centered points in the deﬁnition of diﬀerence operators . We deﬁne the function spaces C m × n = { φ : C m × C n → R } , C ¯ m × ¯ n = { φ : C ¯ m × C ¯ n → R } , ( 3 . 9 ) C ¯ m × n = { φ : C ¯ m × C n → R } , C m × ¯ n = { φ : C m × C ¯ n → R } , ( 3 . 10 ) E ew m × n = { f : E m × C n → R } , E ns m × n = { f : C m × E n → R } . ( 3 . 11 ) The functions of C m × n , C ¯ m × ¯ n , C ¯ m × n , and C m × ¯ n are called cell - centered functions . In component form these functions are identiﬁed via φ i , j : = φ ( x i , y j ) , where x i = (cid:0) i − 12 (cid:1) · h , y j = (cid:0) j − 12 (cid:1) · h , and i and j are integers . The functions of E ew m × n and E ns m × n are called east - west edge - centered functions and north - south edge - centered functions , respectively . In component form east - west edge - centered functions are identiﬁed via f i + 12 , j : = f (cid:16) x i + 12 , y j (cid:17) , and north - south edge - centered functions are identiﬁed via f i , j + 12 : = f (cid:16) x i , y j + 12 (cid:17) , where x i + 12 = i · h , y j = (cid:0) j − 12 (cid:1) · h , x i = (cid:0) i − 12 (cid:1) · h , y j + 12 = j · h , and i and j are integers . Similarly , we deﬁne the edge - to - center diﬀerence operators d x : E ew m × n → C m × n and d y : E ns m × n → C m × n component - wise via d x f i , j = 1 h (cid:16) f i + 12 , j − f i − 12 , j (cid:17) , d y f i , j = 1 h (cid:16) f i , j + 12 − f i , j − 12 (cid:17) , i = 1 , . . . , m j = 1 , . . . , n , ( 3 . 12 ) and center - to - center diﬀerence operators c x : C ¯ m × n → C m × n , c y : C m × ¯ n → C m × n , c x φ i , j = 1 h ( φ i + 1 , j − φ i , j ) , c y φ i , j = 1 h ( φ i , j + 1 − φ i , j ) , i = 1 , . . . , m j = 1 , . . . , n . ( 3 . 13 ) The x - dimension center - to - edge average and diﬀerence operators , respectively , A x , D x : C ¯ m × n → E ew m × n are deﬁned component - wise as A x φ i + 12 , j = 1 2 ( φ i , j + φ i + 1 , j ) , D x φ i + 12 , j = 1 h ( φ i + 1 , j − φ i , j ) , i = 0 , . . . , m j = 1 , . . . , n . ( 3 . 14 ) Likewise , the y - dimension center - to - edge average and diﬀerence operators , respectively , A y , D y : C m × ¯ n → E ns m × n are deﬁned component - wise as A y φ i , j + 12 = 1 2 ( φ i , j + φ i , j + 1 ) , D y φ i , j + 12 = 1 h ( φ i , j + 1 − φ i , j ) , i = 1 , . . . , m j = 0 , . . . , n .

( 3 . 16 ) The numerical 2D integration , B h : C m × n → R in ( 3 . 2 ) is deﬁned as B h = h 2 m (cid:88) i = 1 n (cid:88) j = 1 f surf ( φ i , j , ( c x φ i , j , c y φ i , j ) ) = h 2 m (cid:88) i = 1 n (cid:88) j = 1 3 √ 2 4 (cid:40) 1 εg ( φ i , j ) + ε 2 (cid:34)(cid:18) φ i + 1 , j − φ i , j h (cid:19) 2 + (cid:18) φ i , j + 1 − φ i , j h (cid:19) 2 (cid:35)(cid:41) .

( 3 . 39 ) Then , the system ( 3 . 25 ) - ( 3 . 29 ) is equivalent to N ( φ k + 1 ) = S ( φ k ) . Next , we apply the nonlinear FAS multigrid method to solve N ( φ k + 1 ) = S ( φ k ) for a given φ k . The main points of this method are : ( 1 ) we ﬁrst need a smoothing operator for generating smoothed approximate solutions of N ( φ ) = S , here we use a nonlinear Gauss - Seidel relaxation operator ; ( 2 ) we then use this smoothing operator on each hierarchical grid to get better approximation of φ k + 1 . For further use , we represent the smoothing operator as ¯ φ = Smooth ( φ , N , S , λ ) , ( 3 . 40 ) where λ is the number of smoothing sweeps . Next , let’s give the details of the relaxation . Here , (cid:96) is the index for iterative step , and we set φ ew i + 12 , j : = A x φ ki + 12 , j , φ ns i , j + 12 : = A y φ ki , j + 12 M ψ ew i + 12 , j : = M ψ (cid:16) φ ew i + 12 , j (cid:17) , M ψ ns i , j + 12 : = M ψ (cid:16) φ ns i , j + 12 (cid:17) . The Gauss - Seidel smoothing works as following : for every ( i , j ) , stepping lexicogrphically from ( 1 , 1 ) to ( m , n ) , ﬁnd φ (cid:96) + 1 i , j , µ (cid:96) + 1 i , j , ω (cid:96) + 1 i , j , ψ (cid:96) + 1 i , j , and ν (cid:96) + 1 i , j that solve 10 φ (cid:96) + 1 i , j + sM φ µ (cid:96) + 1 i , j = S ( 1 ) i , j (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) , ( 3 . 41 ) µ (cid:96) + 1 i , j − (cid:20) γ 1 + γ 2 ε 2 g (cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:0) φ ki , j (cid:1) + γ 3 (cid:0) B kh − A h (cid:1) + 4 γ 2 h 2 (cid:21) ω (cid:96) + 1 i , j = S ( 2 ) i , j (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) − γ 2 h 2 (cid:104) ω (cid:96)i + 1 , j + ω (cid:96) + 1 i − 1 , j + ω (cid:96)i , j + 1 + ω (cid:96) + 1 i , j − 1 (cid:105) , ( 3 . 42 ) ω (cid:96) + 1 i , j − (cid:20) 1 ε ( φ (cid:96)i , j ) 2 + 4 ε h 2 (cid:21) φ (cid:96) + 1 i , j = S ( 3 ) i , j (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) − 1 εφ (cid:96)i , j − ε h 2 (cid:104) φ (cid:96)i + 1 , j + φ (cid:96) + 1 i − 1 , j + φ (cid:96)i , j + 1 + φ (cid:96) + 1 i , j − 1 (cid:105) , ( 3 . 43 ) ψ (cid:96) + 1 i , j + s h 2 (cid:104) M ψ ew i + 12 , j + M ψ ew i − 12 , j + M ψ ns i , j + 12 + M ψ ns i , j − 12 (cid:105) ν (cid:96) + 1 i , j = S ( 4 ) i , j (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) + s h 2 (cid:104) M ψ ew i + 12 , j ν (cid:96)i + 1 , j + M ψ ew i − 12 , j ν (cid:96) + 1 i − 1 , j + M ψ ns i , j + 12 ν (cid:96)i , j + 1 + M ψ ns i , j − 12 ν (cid:96) + 1 i , j − 1 (cid:105) , ( 3 . 44 ) ν (cid:96) + 1 i , j − (cid:34) 1 + p (cid:0) φ ki , j (cid:1) 2 · γ in + 1 − p (cid:0) φ ki , j (cid:1) 2 · γ out (cid:35) ψ (cid:96) + 1 i , j = S ( 5 ) i , j (cid:0) φ k (cid:1) . ( 3 . 45 ) In practice , we use Cramer’s Rule to solve this 5 × 5 linear system ( 3 . 41 ) - ( 3 . 45 ) or use Cramer’s Rule to solve 3 × 3 linear system ( 3 . 41 ) - ( 3 . 43 ) and solve 2 × 2 linear system ( 3 . 44 ) - ( 3 . 45 ) simultaneously , since ( 3 . 41 ) - ( 3 . 43 ) and ( 3 . 44 ) - ( 3 . 45 ) are independent . Multigrid works on a hierarchy of grids . We use the smoothing operator on each level of the grids to get a better approximation . Here , we set minlevel ≤ level ≤ 0 , 0 means the index of the ﬁnest grid , and minlevel is the index of the coarsest grid . We also need to transform the results between two levels of grids . By I level - 1 level we denote the restriction operator which is deﬁned by cell - center averaging , and by I levellevel − 1 we denote the prolongation operator which is deﬁned by piece - wise constant interpolation . I level - 1 level transfers ﬁne grid functions to the coarse grid , while I levellevel − 1 transfers coarse grid functions to the ﬁne grid . The following is the algorithm for our multigrid solver [ 37 ] , in which φ k + 1 , m + 1 level = FASVcycle (cid:0) φ k + 1 , m level , N level , S level , λ , level (cid:1) is the recursive FAS V - Cycle iteration operator and the superscript m is the V - Cycle loop index . 3 . 4 Algorithm RECURSIVE FAS V - CYCLE OPERATOR φ k + 1 , m + 1 level = FASVcycle (cid:0) φ k + 1 , m level , N level , S level , λ , level (cid:1) Pre - smoothing : ¯ φ level = Smooth (cid:0) φ k + 1 , m level , N level , S level , λ (cid:1) Coarse - grid correction : If level > minlevel S level − 1 = I level − 1 level ( S level − N level ) + N level − 1 (cid:0) I level − 1 level ¯ φ level (cid:1) , ( 3 . 46 ) ¯ φ level − 1 = FASVcycle (cid:0) I level − 1 level φ level , N level − 1 , S level − 1 , λ , level − 1 (cid:1) , ( 3 . 47 ) ˆ φ level − 1 = ¯ φ level − 1 − I level − 1 level ¯ φ level , ( 3 . 48 ) ˆ φ level = ¯ φ level + I levellevel − 1 ˆ φ level − 1 , ( 3 . 49 ) post - smooth : φ k + 1 , m + 1 level = Smooth (cid:0) ˆ φ level , N level , S level , λ (cid:1) .

We present the results of convergence tests and perform sample computations . In all the tests below , we set L x = L y for simplicity , and use the interpolation function p ( φ ) = − 12 φ 3 + 32 φ which satisﬁes p ( 1 ) = 1 , p ( − 1 ) = − 1 , and p (cid:48) ( − 1 ) = p (cid:48) ( 1 ) = 0 in ( 2 . 3 ) . In the ﬁrst set of tests in subsection 4 . 1 , we show evidence that the multigrid solver converges with optimal ( or near optimal ) complexity . In the second set of tests in subsection 4 . 2 , we provide evidence that the scheme is convergent and the global error is of ﬁrst order in time and second order in space . We then present a series numerical studies on the growth and shrinkage cases using the condition established in Section 2 . 2 . 4 . 1 Convergence and Complexity of the Multigrid Solver We perform six separate tests to demonstrate the convergence and near optimal complexity ( with respect to the grid size h ) of the multigrid solver . We provide evidence that the multigrid convergence rate is nearly independent of h . For all the tests we take the initial data φ 0 i , j = tanh (cid:32) 0 . 18 − (cid:112) 0 . 75 ( x i − 0 . 5 ) 2 + ( y j − 0 . 5 ) 2 √ 2 ε (cid:33) , ( 4 . 1 ) ψ 0 i , j = − φ 0 i , j × 0 . 1 + 0 . 7 , ( 4 . 2 ) 12 and set the parameters L x = L y = 1 . 0 , γ surf = 1 . 0 , γ area = 1 . 0 × 10 4 , γ in = 1 . 0 × 10 5 , γ out = 1 . 0 × 10 5 , ψ in = 0 . 1 , ψ out = 0 . 8 , M 0 = 0 . 5 , M φ = 1 . 0 , β in = 0 . 0 , β out = 0 . 0 . We use the temporal step size s = 5 . 0 × 10 − 7 , and study the numerical results at the 20 th time step . We vary the spatial step size h from 1 . 0 / 128 to 1 . 0 / 1024 and compare the number of multigrid iterations required to reduce the norm of the residual below the tolerance τ = 1 . 0 × 10 − 8 . Here , the stopping tolerance is (cid:107) R ( φ ) (cid:107) 2 , (cid:63) ≤ τ = 1 . 0 × 10 − 8 , where R ( φ ) and the norm are deﬁned in ( 3 . 51 ) of Section 3 . 4 . λ is the number of multigrid smoothing sweeps in the multigrid solver , as deﬁned in Section 3 . 3 . Based on our experience as well as established in [ 38 ] , we expect that the optimal value of λ should be less than 5 . In Table 1 , we show the number of multigrid iterations needed for various choices of ε , λ , and γ bend . We can see that for the smoothing parameters λ = 2 , the required number of iterations is nearly independent of h . The detailed residual values for Test 2 and Test 6 in Table 1 are given in graphical form in Figure 5 , from which we observe for λ = 2 the norm of residual is reduced approximately the same factor at each iteration regardless of h . With λ = 1 , we do not have this . By these features of multigrid operator with optimal complexity in [ 40 , 38 ] , it is evident that the multigrid solver here has near optimal complexity at λ = 2 . Table 1 : The number of multigrid iterations required to reduce the norm of the residual below the tolerance τ = 1 . 0 × 10 − 8 . The data are checked at the 20 th time step using the ﬁxed temporal step size s = 5 . 0 × 10 − 7 . The initial data are given by ( 4 . 1 ) - ( 4 . 2 ) . The parameters are given in the text and in the table . The precise residual values for Test 2 and 6 are shown in Figure 5 . Using the multigrid smoothing parameter λ = 2 we observe , for a variety of parameter sets , that the required number of iterations is nearly independent of h Test 1 Test 2 Test 3 Test 4 Test 5 Test 6 Test 7 Test 8 ε 2 × 10 − 2 2 × 10 − 2 3 × 10 − 2 5 × 10 − 2 2 × 10 − 2 2 × 10 − 2 3 × 10 − 2 5 × 10 − 2 λ 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 γ bend 0 . 1 1 0 . 5 1 0 . 1 1 0 . 5 1 h 1 . 0 / 128 11 9 8 11 8 8 10 7 1 . 0 / 256 11 10 9 11 8 9 9 7 1 . 0 / 512 10 11 10 12 9 9 9 8 1 . 0 / 1024 11 12 11 12 9 9 9 8 13 Figure 5 : The residual values per multigrid iteration in Test 2 and 6 at the 20 th time step with step size s = 5 . 0 × 10 − 7 . The initial data are given by ( 4 . 1 ) - ( 4 . 2 ) . The parameters are given in the text and in Table 1 . The results show that the residual reduction is nearly independent of h at λ = 2 , which suggests the near optimal complexity of the solver 4 . 2 Convergence of the Scheme as s , h → 0 Next , we perform convergence tests of our scheme ( 3 . 20 ) - ( 3 . 24 ) as s , h → 0 . We expect that , at best , the global error in φ is e t = T = O ( s ) + O ( h 2 ) . To this end , we perform four tests similar to those in [ 37 ] , under the same conditions except a reﬁnement path of the form s = Ch 2 . The initial data is given in ( 4 . 1 ) - ( 4 . 2 ) and the parameters used are L x = L y = 1 . 0 , ε = 0 . 02 , γ bend = 0 . 1 , γ surf = 1 . 0 , γ area = 1 . 0 × 10 4 , γ in = 1 . 0 × 10 5 , γ out = 1 . 0 × 10 5 , ψ in = 0 . 1 , ψ out = 0 . 8 , M 0 = 0 . 5 , M φ = 1 . 0 , β in = 0 . 0 , β out = 0 . 0 . and T = 6 . 4 × 10 − 4 , where T is the ﬁnal time . We set time step size s = 6 . 4 × 10 − 6 and spatial step size h = 1 / 128 , and check if the global error is reduced by a factor of 4 when h is reduced by a factor of 2 and s is reduced by a factor of 4 . Results in Table 2 show evidence that the algorithm is convergent in space and the global error is indeed e t = T = O ( h 2 ) . Reﬁnement study in time step also show a ﬁrst order accuracy . In other words , a global error of the form e t = T = O ( s ) + O ( h 2 ) is consistent with the test results . Table 2 : Errors and convergence rates of the scheme ( 3 . 20 ) - ( 3 . 24 ) . Parameters are given in the text and the initial data is given by ( 4 . 1 ) - ( 4 . 2 ) . Five tests with a reﬁnement step size s = Ch 2 are presented . The error here is the global error between two nearby tests .

We use initial conditions and parameters as the growth case described in Section 2 . 2 . Take initial condition φ 0 i , j as the smoothed result of ˆ φ 0 i , j via a classical Cahn - Hilliard equation , ˆ φ 0 i , j = 1 , if ( x i , y j ) ∈ Ω 1 = (cid:8) ( x i , y j ) | ( x i − 0 . 5 ) 2 + ( y j − 0 . 5 ) 2 ≤ r 2 (cid:9) ( 4 . 3 ) ˆ φ 0 i , j = − 1 . if ( x i , y j ) ∈ Ω \ Ω 1 ( 4 . 4 ) and ψ 0 i , j = − φ 0 i , j × 0 . 35 + 0 . 45 , ( x i , y j ) ∈ Ω ( 4 . 5 ) where r = 0 . 18 + 0 . 03 cos ( 10 θ ) , θ ∈ [ 0 , 2 π ] . We use parameters L x = L y = 1 . 0 , h = 1 . 0 / 256 , ε = 0 . 01 , γ surf = 1 . 0 , γ bend = 0 . 05 , γ area = 5 . 0 × 10 4 , γ in = 1 . 0 × 10 5 , γ out = 1 . 0 × 10 5 , ψ out = 0 . 8 , M 0 = 0 . 5 , M φ = 1 . 0 , β in = 0 . 0 , β out = 0 . 0 , s = 1 × 10 − 6 , and the ﬁnal time T = 2 . 5 × 10 − 2 . In this case , the equilibrium concentration values are ψ in (cid:63) = ψ in and ψ out (cid:63) = ψ out . The initial concentration of the outer phase is ψ 0 = 0 . 8 = ψ out (cid:63) , which is at the equilibrium value . For the inner phase , the initial concentration is ψ 0 = 0 . 1 . We next perform two sample computations with the equilibrium concentration of the inner phase ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 3 or ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 65 . According to the common tangent analysis in Section 2 . 2 , both cases will have growth eﬀect . In Figure 6 and Figure 7 , we show the result when ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 3 and ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 65 , respectively . In both calculations , we can see the growth of inner regions from the shape evolution ( the evolution of φ ) in ( a ) of the two ﬁgures . The diﬀerence is that the vesicle in Figure 7 grows into a circle , which is the state with maximized volume when the interface area stay unchanged ; while the one in Figure 6 does not . Data in ( b ) - ( e ) of both ﬁgures explain how these changes and diﬀerences happen . ( b ) shows the evolution of energy F surf , F bend , F area , and F osm , respectively . It’s easy to tell that the total energy drop signiﬁcantly mainly due to the rapid decline of F osm , while the surface energy F surf remain roughly constant because of the penalty coeﬃcient γ area . The detailed data of F surf , i . e . , the arclength of the interface , are shown in ( c ) . We note that both changes are within 4 × 10 − 3 , that is within 0 . 265 % compared to the original value . ( d ) shows the mass changes in the domain Ω , the interior region ( white ) , and the exterior region ( black ) , respectively . The interior mass grows with the same amount that is lost in the exterior region , i . e . the total mass is conserved . ( e ) shows the evolution of concentration of the interior region ( ψ in ) and the concentration of the exterior region ( ψ out ) . Curves in Figure 6 ( e ) present that ψ in increases to its equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 3 and ψ out stays at the equilibrium value ψ out (cid:63) = 0 . 8 , which is consistent with the analysis in Section 2 . 2 . But in Figure 7 , the outcomes are not exactly the same . The reason is that it needs certain amount of net mass moved from the outer phase into the inner phase to attain the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 65 in the inner phase , however the arclength inextensibility ( interface area in 3D ) here does not allow the inner concentration to increase to the expected equilibrium value 0 . 65 , because the vesicle already reaches a circular morphology , the shape with the maximum area ( volume in 3D ) for the ﬁxed arclength , and cannot accept any additional mass from the exterior region . For the same initial condition in ( 4 . 3 ) - ( 4 . 5 ) , we now set γ bend = 0 . 5 which means a ten times bending energy F bend compared to the previous calculation , and other parameters remain the same as those used in Figure 7 . The results are summarized in Figure 8 . Compared to Figure 7 , the shape evolution in Figure 8 are obviously diﬀerent at the ﬁrst several time steps due to a much faster decline of F bend . Eventually the interface evolves into a circle . In Figure 9 , we show shape evolution of four vesicles with diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations , and other parameters remain the same as those used in Figure 7 . Numerical experiments show that : the white region will grow with the decline of osmotic energy ; the sharp corners will swell faster for a fast drop of bending energy ; as long as the inner equilibrium concentration ψ in (cid:63) and the initial osmotic energy F osm are large enough , the inner region will grow into a circle with preserved arclength . 15 Figure 6 : The evolution of φ , energy , surface area , mass , and concentration in a growth case . The initial condition is given in ( 4 . 3 ) - ( 4 . 5 ) and the parameters are in the text . The only initial diﬀerence with Figure 7 is that here we set ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 3 . ( a ) shows the growth of inner region . The wrinkled interface stretches gradually with permanent area . In ( b ) , the osmotic energy declines rapidly causing the interior growth . The bending energy drops during the swelling . The surface energy remain roughly a constant and F area stay close to 0 due to the penalty coeﬃcient γ area . ( c ) presents the change of F surf , i . e . , the interface area , is within 2 × 10 − 3 , 0 . 133 % compared to the original surface area . In ( d ) , the interior mass grows with the same amount lost in the exterior region , i . e . , the total mass is conserved . ( e ) shows that ψ in increases to the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 3 , while ψ out stays at the value of equilibrium ψ out (cid:63) = 0 . 8 . 16 Figure 7 : The evolution of φ , energy , surface area , mass , and concentration in a growth case . The initial condition is given in ( 4 . 3 ) - ( 4 . 5 ) and the parameters are in the text . The only initial diﬀerence with Figure 6 is that ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 65 . ( a ) shows the growth of inner region . The wrinkled interface stretches gradually with permanent area and eventually the vesicle grows into a circle . In ( b ) , the osmotic energy declines rapidly causing the interior growth . The bending energy drops until the wrinkled interface grows into a circle . The surface energy remain roughly a constant and F area stay close to 0 due to the penalty coeﬃcient γ area . ( c ) presents the change of F surf , i . e . , the interface area , is within 4 × 10 − 3 , 0 . 265 % compared to the original surface area . In ( d ) , the inside mass grows with the same amount lost in the outside region , i . e . , the total mass is conserved . ( e ) shows that ψ in increases toward the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 65 but stays at about 0 . 6 while ψ out stays close to but not at the value of equilibrium ψ out (cid:63) = 0 . 8 , because the vesicle already reaches a circular morphology ( the shape with the maximum area with ﬁxed arclength ) and cannot accept any additional mass from the exterior region . 17 Figure 8 : The evolution of φ , energy , surface area , mass , and concentration for another growth case . The initial condition and the parameters are the same as those in Figure 7 except γ bend = 0 . 5 . ( a ) shows the similar growth eﬀect as in Figure 7 : the wrinkled interface stretches with permanent area and ﬁnally grows into a circle . But the shapes at the ﬁrst several time steps are obviously diﬀerent due to a faster decline of F bend . In ( b ) , the decline of osmotic energy causes the interior growth . The bending energy drops until the wrinkled interface grows into a circle . F surf remain roughly a constant and F area stay close to 0 due to the penalty coeﬃcient γ area . ( c ) - ( d ) present the surface area constraint and mass conservation . ( e ) shows ψ in approaches the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 65 , and ψ out stay close to the value of the equilibrium ψ out (cid:63) = 0 . 8 as in Figure 7 . 18 Figure 9 : Shape evolution of other growth examples with diﬀerent initial conditions but same parameters as in Figure 7 . The white regions grow because of the decline of osmotic energy ; the sharp corners swell faster for a fast drop of bending energy ; as long as the inner equilibrium concentration ψ in (cid:63) and the initial osmotic energy F osm are great enough , the inner region will grow into a circle with preserved surface area . 4 . 4 Shrinkage Model In this section , we study the shrinking eﬀect following the condition discussed in section 2 . 2 . That is the area ( volume in 3D ) of the vesicle will decrease with prescribed arclength ( surface area in 3D ) . We take the initial shape φ 0 i , j as a smoothed result of ˆ φ 0 i , j via a classical Cahn - Hilliard equation , ˆ φ 0 i , j = 1 , if ( x i , y j ) ∈ Ω 1 = (cid:8) ( x i , y j ) | ( x i − 0 . 5 ) 2 + ( y j − 0 . 5 ) 2 ≤ r 2 (cid:9) ( 4 . 6 ) ˆ φ 0 i , j = − 1 . if ( x i , y j ) ∈ Ω \ Ω 1 ( 4 . 7 ) and ψ 0 i , j = − φ 0 i , j × 0 . 1 + 0 . 7 , ( x i , y j ) ∈ Ω ( 4 . 8 ) where r = 0 . 3 + 0 . 01 cos ( 10 θ ) , θ ∈ [ 0 , 2 π ] . We set parameters L x = L y = 1 . 0 , h = 1 . 0 / 256 , ε = 0 . 01 , γ surf = 1 . 0 , γ bend = 0 . 1 , γ area = 5 . 0 × 10 4 , γ in = 1 . 0 × 10 5 , γ out = 1 . 0 × 10 5 , ψ in = 0 . 1 , ψ out = 0 . 8 , M 0 = 0 . 5 , M φ = 1 . 0 , β in = 0 . 0 , β out = 0 . 0 , s = 1 . 0 × 10 − 6 , and the ﬁnal calculation T = 4 . 0 × 10 − 2 . In this case , the equilibrium concentration values are ψ in (cid:63) = ψ in = 0 . 1 and ψ out (cid:63) = ψ out = 0 . 8 . 19 In Figure 10 ( a ) , we show the shape evolution of φ , which is obviously shrinking of the inner region while the interface becomes wrinkled . In Figure 10 ( b ) , we show the energy evolution curves of F surf , F bend , F area , and F osm . F bend slightly increases at early times when F osm drop signiﬁcantly , leading to a shrinkage of the vesicle volume . F surf , however , stays roughly unchanged due to the arclength constraint . The detailed data of the surface area could be checked in Figure 10 ( c ) . Figure 10 ( d ) gives the change of mass of the interior and exterior regions , as well as the total mass conservation . In Figure 10 ( e ) , the inner concentration ψ in is approaching the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 1 , while outer concentration ψ out roughly stays at the equilibrium value ψ out (cid:63) = 0 . 8 . Next , we study the shape evolution when γ bend = 1 , which is a ten times bending energy compared with the previous computation . In Figure 11 , we ﬁnd that the inner phase shrinks with a very diﬀerent pattern due to a much larger bending energy . The energy changes are similar to the ones in Figure 10 ( b ) . In Figure 11 ( c ) - ( d ) , we present the surface area constraint and mass conservation . In Figure 11 ( e ) , we show that the concentrations inside and outside the interface approach the equilibrium values ψ in (cid:63) and ψ out (cid:63) , respectively . In Figure 12 , we present shape evolution of several other shrinkage examples with diﬀerent initial morphology . They all follow the similar pattern : the white region will shrink for the decline of osmotic energy ; the sharp corners will shrink to form ﬁnger - like structures ; the shrinking process is always associated with arclength constraint and total mass conservation . Note that the concentrations of the inner and outer phases evolve to their corresponding equilibrium values . 20 Figure 10 : The evolution of φ , energy , surface area , mass , and concentration in a shrinkage case . The initial condition is given in ( 4 . 6 ) - ( 4 . 8 ) and the parameters are in the text . ( a ) shows shrinkage eﬀects where the inter - face becomes wrinkled with prescribed surface area and the sharp corners shrink to form ﬁnger - like structures . In ( b ) , the osmotic energy declines rapidly causing the inner region shrinking . The bending energy slightly grows at ﬁrst because of the shrinking . The surface energy remain roughly a constant and F area stay close to 0 due to the surface area constraint . ( c ) presents the change of F surf is within 5 × 10 − 3 , 0 . 26 % compared to the original surface area . ( d ) implies the mass conservation . In ( e ) , ψ in approaches the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 1 , while ψ out stays at the equilibrium value ψ out (cid:63) = 0 . 8 . 21 Figure 11 : The evolution of φ , energy , surface area , mass , and concentration in another shrinkage case . The initial condition and the parameters are the same as those in Figure 10 except γ bend = 1 . ( a ) shows the similar shrinkage eﬀect as in Figure 10 : the interface become wrinkled with permanent area , but the shape is diﬀerent due to a much greater F bend . In ( b ) , decline of the osmotic energy causes the inner region shrinking . F bend decreases , F surf remains roughly a constant and F area stays close to 0 . ( c ) - ( d ) present the interface area constraint and mass conservation . In ( e ) , ψ in approaches the equilibrium value ψ in (cid:63) = 0 . 1 , while ψ out stays at the equilibrium value ψ out (cid:63) = 0 . 8 . 22 Figure 12 : Shape evolution of other shrinkage examples with diﬀerent initial morphology but same parameters as those used in Figure 10 . They have a similar pattern : the inner region shrinks for the decline of osmotic energy and the sharp corners shrink to form ﬁnger - like structure ; the shrinking process is with preserved surface area and mass ; the concentrations of the inner and outer phases evolve to the corresponding equilibrium values . 5 Conclusion In this paper , we have developed a phase ﬁeld model for vesicle growth or shrinkage based on osmotic pressure that arises due to a chemical potential gradient . The primary contribution is that we deﬁned a neat form of osmotic energy ( 2 . 3 ) with two simple quadratic functions ( 2 . 4 ) . Another novelty is the control conditions derived by the common tangent construction for growth or shrinkage in Section 2 . 2 . We directly discretized the model ( a coupled Allen - Cahn and Cahn - Hilliard equations ) , and implemented a nonlinear FAS multigrid method 23 for computation . We showed detailed convergence tests and presented numerically the evolution of growth and shrinkage cases . It turns out that the proposed model provide an eﬀective way for describing vesicle growth or shrinkage in diﬀerent situations by changing the parameters in the multiple kinds of free energies . Though we have only done the numerical computing without stability and solvability analysis in this paper , we plan to construct a new scheme based on a convex splitting of the discrete energy , by which both the unconditional unique solvability and energy stability of the numerical scheme are assured [ 37 , 44 ] . In addition , we plan to extend this work to 3D and a more complex evolution by adding a Stokes - like equation , following some ideas used in [ 45 , 46 ] . This ﬂuid - structure interaction type model will enable a full realization of vesicle dynamics , though challenging due to the two extra variables : velocity and pressure . 6 acknowledgements SL acknowledges the support from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , Division of Mathematical Sci - ences grant DMS - 1720420 .
