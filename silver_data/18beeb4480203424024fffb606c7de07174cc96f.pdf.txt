Automatic Conspiracy Theory Identification ( ACTI ) is a new shared task proposed for the first time at the EVALITA 2023 evaluation campaign . ACTI is based on a new , manually labeled dataset of comments scraped from conspiratorial Telegram channels and consists of two subtasks : ( 1 ) identifying conspiratorial content ( conspiratorial content classification ) ; and ( 2 ) classifying content into specific conspiracy theories ( conspiratorial category classification ) . A total of 15 teams participated in the task with 81 submissions . In this task summary , we discuss the data and task , and outline the best - performing approaches that are largely based on large language models . We conclude with a brief discussion of the application of large language models to counter the spread of misinformation on online platforms . Keywords Conspiracy Theory , Content Moderation , Large Language Models , Computational Social Science 1 . Introduction From ancient tales of secret societies , [ 1 ] to speculation on whether the moon landing happened [ 2 ] , belief in conspiracy theories has been prevalent throughout hu - man history [ 3 ] and has inflicted harm upon individuals and groups falsely accused of wrongdoing [ 4 ] . For ex - ample , in the middle ages , the Blood Libel conspiracy theory falsely accused Jews of murdering Christian boys , fostering their persecution [ 5 ] . Fast - forward to the digital age , the Internet has emerged as the prominent medium through which indi - viduals are exposed to conspiracy theories [ 6 , 7 ] . Indeed , mainstream and fringe platforms have served as de - facto incubators of online conspiracies [ 8 ] . Notably , the impact of online conspiracy theories has been far - reaching , in - citing real - world violence and influencing public health . The QAnon conspiracy , which gained momentum during the Trump administration , was pivotal in planning the 2021 invasion of the US Capitol [ 9 , 10 ] . At the same time , the conspiracy theories associated with COVID - 19 fu - eled anti - vaccination sentiments and skepticism towards public health measures [ 11 , 12 ] . Mainstream platforms limit the diffusion of conspir - atorial content through interventions that range from banning online communities [ 13 , 14 ] to telling users that the information presented may be inaccurate [ 15 ] . While these interventions may help curb the proliferation of conspiracy theories in online spaces [ 16 ] , they require a EVALITA 2023 : 8 th Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian , Sep 7 ‚Äì 8 , Parma , IT $ russog @ ethz . ch ( G .

CEUR WorkshopProceedings http : / / ceur - ws . org ISSN 1613 - 0073 CEUR Workshop Proceedings ( CEUR - WS . org ) fundamental technology : ways to identify conspiratorial content accurately and at scale across various languages and cultural contexts . In this context , we propose the Automatic Conspiracy Theory Identification ( ACTI ) task . Considering a dataset with over 25 thousand posts in Italian extracted from five Telegram channels , the ACTI consists of two subtasks : ( i ) a binary classification task where the goal is to deter - mine if a given text piece is conspiratorial or not ; and ( ii ) a multi - class classification task to recognize specific conspiracy theories . 2 . Task Description The ACTI shared task comprises two subtasks , which we describe below . A : Conspiratorial Content Classification . The first subtask is determining whether a Telegram post is con - spiratorial . We consider conspiratorial texts as those that either : ( i ) express the belief that influential people create major events ( e . g . , COVID - 19 ) to protect their interests or ( ii ) interpret events in a way that supports the narrative of a conspiracy theory . Note that this definition of ‚Äúconspiratorial‚Äù is broad , as texts may be defined as conspiratorial if they under - mine commonly accepted views on societal issues . For example , the text ‚Äúil cancro femminista sta prendendo piene‚Äù should be classified as conspiratorial , as it subtly supports a broader theory claiming that women‚Äôs rights are destroying the stability of Western societies . a r X i v : 2307 . 06954v3 [ c s . C L ] 2 S e p 2023 B : Conspiracy Category Classification . The second subtask is determining which conspiracy theory a post belongs to . In particular , we consider four possible con - spiracy theories . ‚Ä¢ COVID - 19 : Text concerning vaccine production , 5G , and non - pharmacological interventions as a tool of control over people . Texts denying the pandemic was a real event or minimizing its im - portance . ‚Ä¢ QAnon : Texts associated with the QAnon theory . According to QAnon , a group of Satanic canni - balist sex abusers conspired against former U . S . President Donald Trump during his term in office . This theory extended far over its original scope embodying other beliefs that support ( among the others ) the idea that women are enemies ( hate against women ) and that a powerful elite ( led by public figures like Pope Francis , Queen Elizabeth , and Hillary Clinton ) is trying to organize a New World Order . ‚Ä¢ Flat - Earth : Texts associated with the claim that the earth is flat and that influential organizations hide this fact from laypeople . Usually , the flat - earth conspiracy theory is supported by pseudo - scientific evidence . ‚Ä¢ Pro - Russia : Texts associated with conspirato - rial beliefs promoting Russian interests , e . g . , that nazists control Ukraine‚Äôs governments and army . 3 . Data Collection To gather the necessary data for the ACTI task , we em - ploy a customized web crawler using the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python . Our web crawler tar - gets specific sources known for hosting conspiratorial content on the Telegram platform . Specifically , we focus on a selection of Telegram chan - nels that gained notoriety for promoting far - right ideolo - gies and disseminating conspiracy theories . The channels we collect data from include : Qlobal - Change Italia , Basta Dittatura , Studi Scientifici Vaccini , Terra Piatta , and Den - tro La Notizia . For example , the channel ‚ÄúBasta Dittatura‚Äù has been actively involved in various events , including the siege of a trade union headquarters , indicating its strong affiliation with conspiratorial movements . Our data collection process spanned from January 1 , 2020 , to June 30 , 2020 , during which we capture and retain comments written in Italian . To ensure sufficient text for analysis , we filtered out comments with less than ten words . We gathered a dataset comprising 25 , 612 posts extracted from these five Telegram channels . We summarize statistics about our dataset in fig . 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 Count Normal Cospiracy Label Sub - task : A Original Augmented 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 Count COVID QAnon Flat - Earth Russia Label Sub - task : B Original Figure 1 : Distribution of labels for Subtask A and Subtask B . 3 . 1 . Annotation Process The data collection process for our study on conspirato - rial content in online channels involved several steps to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the collected data . One of the main challenges we encountered was the pres - ence of non - conspiratorial content within the channels . While some comments discussed conspiratorial topics , others contained valid points or critiques regarding con - spiratorial perspectives . Additionally , some comments were deemed meaningless and needed to be filtered out to maintain the integrity of the dataset . To address this , we employed two human annota - tors who were responsible for labeling the comments according to three categories : ‚ÄúNot Relevant , ‚Äù ‚ÄúNon - Conspiratorial , ‚Äù and ‚ÄúConspiratorial . ‚Äù The ‚ÄúNot Relevant‚Äù label was assigned to comments that did not contribute to the discussion , while the ‚ÄúNon - Conspiratorial‚Äù label was used for comments that did not involve conspiratorial content . The ‚ÄúConspiratorial‚Äù label indicated comments that contained or supported conspiratorial discussions . For the comments labeled as ‚ÄúConspiratorial , ‚Äù we fur - ther categorized them into four subcategories : ‚ÄúQAnon‚Äù , ‚ÄúCovid19‚Äù , ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù , and‚ÄúFlat - Earth‚Äù . Thesesubcategories allowed us to analyze specific conspiracy theories in greater detail . The definitions of conspiratorial content are based on established studies in the field [ 17 , 18 ] , en - suring consistency and clarity in our annotation process . To assess the agreement between the annotators , we calculated inter - annotator agreement rates using Cohen‚Äôs ùúÖ coefficient . The two annotators achieved high agree - ment levels , with a Cohen‚Äôs ùúÖ of 0 . 93 for the first task and 0 . 86 for the second task , demonstrating the reliability of the annotation process . To maintain data integrity , we excluded comments that did not receive the same classi - fication from both annotators . Additionally , comments labeled ‚ÄúNot Relevant‚Äù were discarded from the dataset to focus solely on relevant conspiratorial content . Our data collection process yielded 2 , 301 comments for the first subtask and 1 , 110 comments for the second subtask . This resulted in a curated dataset that provides a solid foundation for research on conspiratorial content in online discussions . 4 . Evaluation Measures We chose different evaluation metrics for subtasks A and B because of the distribution of the labels provided by the annotators . In particular A : Conspiratorial Content Classification . The sys - tems submitted by participants are evaluated using the standard accuracy measures and ranked accordingly . B : Conspiracy Category Classification . Given the class imbalance for the four types of conspiracy theories we identified , we opt for using as a metric the F1 - Score . For a multi - class classification problem , we calculate the F1 - score per class in a one - vs - rest manner . We rate each class separately , computing the F1 - score for each con - spiracy theory in our dataset . To obtain a single score , we then average the per - class F1 - scores . Baselines . We follow the same methodological ap - proach to provide a baseline for both subtasks . Specifi - cally , the baselines for subtasks A and B are a Random Forest trained on a bag - of - words representation of the comments . In particular , we trained the random forest with 500 estimators and validated it using a five - fold cross - validation . These baselines achieve 0 . 63 accuracy for the first and 0 . 68 for the second subtask , respectively . 5 . Results A total of fifteen teams submitted from seven institutions participated in the two tasks . Specifically , eight teams submitted for the conspiracy content classification and seven for the conspiracy category classification . In total , we obtain 81 submissions . In Tables 1 and 2 , we show the results for both submissions .

The best performing approach was obtained via Contrastive Training 5 . 1 . Conspiratorial Content Classification Table 1 reports the results of the Conspiratorial Content Classification subtask , which received 40 submissions . The " Andy P . " team from the University Politehnica of Bucharest achieves the highest accuracy of 0 . 85 with five submissions . Their methodology consists of an Italian language Sentence Transformer model trained it using contrastive learning . Due to imbalanced data , the par - ticipants integrated a data augmentation step in their classification pipeline . Specifically , their methodology generates synthetic data via a Large Language Model ( LLM ) . These synthetic data are then used for training the model . Figure 2 provides an overview of their method - ology . The second best - performing team submitted a LLM - based model as well . Specifically , the participants tested extremIT5 ( an encoder - decoder model ) and extrem - ITLLaMA ( an instruction - tuned Decoder - only Large Lan - guage Model ) designed for handling Italian instructions . While LLM - based approaches performed best , other par - ticipants developed methods based on transformers and ensembles , which achieved an accuracy of over 0 . 80 .

The best - performing approach was obtained via Contrastive Training ( 0 . 91 ) . Interestingly , the data augmentation process used for subtask A did increase the model performance . In - deed , the participants submitted the same transformer - based model trained with contrastive learning , excluding the data augmentation block . The second - best perform - ing team from Tor Vergata University ( Michael Vitali ) achieved an F1 - Score of 0 . 89 . They fine - tuned two BERT models , one in Italian and one multilingual , and com - bined them in an ensemble . Numerous teams performed well in this task , achieving F1 - scores beyond 0 . 80 . Only one participant obtained a result slightly inferior to the provided baseline . 6 . Discussion A comprehensive analysis of the submitted systems re - veals that most participants opted for LLMs - based mod - els . Within this context , we emphasize two distinct ap - proaches the participants employ : ( i ) prompting and ( ii ) data augmentation . Upon thorough analysis , we find that while prompting does result in positive outcomes , the predictive capabilities of zero - shot LLMs are still inferior to systems that have been finetuned for a specific task . 6 . 1 . Prompting Large Language Models Prompting consists of providing information to a trained model to predict output labels for a task . It is a task - agnostic approach , making it versatile and widely appli - cable [ 19 ] . This is achieved through concise instructions , referred to as prompts , which guide the model‚Äôs behavior . The power and flexibility of prompting LLMs are well exemplified by team ExtremITA‚Äôs approach : adopting a Large Language Model ( LLM ) to address all EVALITA tasks simultaneously . For the ACTI task , ExtremITA is prompted with simple questions such as ‚ÄúDoes this text talk about a conspiracy ? Answer yes or no‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhich conspiracy theory is discussed in this text : Covid , QAnon , Flat Earth , or Russia ? ‚Äù This approach ranks second in subtask A of ACTI , achieving a score of 0 . 86 F1 - score . However , it significantly drops in performance in subtask B , ranking fifth with a score of 0 . 85 F1 - score . In other EVALITA tasks , ExtremITA showed signif - icant variability in predictive capacity . It ranked first in eight out of twenty - five tasks , but in the remaining subtasks , it performed poorly , ranking between fifth and eleventh . These results confirm LLMs‚Äô high potential and applicability in real - world scenarios . However , the high variability of results shows that LLMs need help im - proving over models fine - tuned on specific tasks . Future research should focus on refining prompting techniques to improve the predictive capacity of LLMs at the single - task level . 6 . 2 . Augmenting Data with LLMs The winning team of subtasks A and B ( ‚ÄúAndy P . ‚Äù ) used an approach based on data augmentation via Large Lan - guage Models and the training of sentence transform - ers with contrastive learning . This approach tackles the challenge of the acquisition of conspiratorial data . In - deed , collecting and labeling conspiratorial data requires substantial efforts by domain specialists . This approach tested the possibility of leveraging LLMs to generate syn - thetic data and use it to train systems for automatically detecting conspiratorial content based . However , it is essential to note that validating the quality of data gener - ated by LLM is an open issue within the NLP community . While LLMs can effectively produce synthetic content , assessing its authenticity and alignment with real - world conspiratorial beliefs is crucial . The lower performance of the model augmented with synthetic data suggests that the quality of the generated data drastically impacts the overall model performance . Therefore , human evalu - ation is mandatory to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches . 7 . Conclusion A recent position paper [ 20 ] asks whether EVALITA has reached its end in light of the increasing use of LLMs . However , based on the outcomes presented in this report , it becomes evident that the answer remains negative . The challenges posed by EVALITA tasks persist as a crucial as - set in comprehending and advancing language resources and tools specifically for the Italian language . This fact is exemplified by transformer - based models‚Äô differing rank - ings , demonstrating the evaluation campaign‚Äôs diversity and significance . However , the performance achieved by LLMs is undoubtedly pushing the limits of some tasks , especially text classification tasks . In conclusion , while LLMs have shown great potential , EVALITA remains an essential platform for improving language tools for the Italian language .
