Precursor ion spectra for 50 acyl anion fragments of fatty acids ( fatty acid scanning ) acquired in parallel increased the speciﬁcity and the dynamic range of the detection of PCs and identiﬁed the fatty acid moieties in individual PC species . Subsequent analysis of detected PC peaks by MS 3 fragmentation on an ion trap mass spectrometer quantiﬁed the relative amount of their positional isomers , thus providing the most detailed and comprehensive characterization of the molecular com - position of the pool of PCs at the low - picomole level . The method is vastly simpliﬁed , compared with conventional ap - proaches , and does not require preliminary separation of lipid classes or of individual molecular species , enzymatic digestion , or chemical derivatization . The approach was val - idated by the comparative analysis of the molecular compo - sition of PCs from human red blood cells . In the total lipid extract of Madin - Darby canine kidney II cells , we de - tected 46 PC species with unique fatty acid composition and demonstrated that the presence of positional isomers al - most doubled the total number of individual molecular spe - cies . —Ekroos , K . , C .

Lipid Res . 2003 . 44 : 2181 – 2192 . Supplementary key words quadrupole time - of - ﬂight • Madin - Darby canine kidney II cells • human red blood cells • mass spectrometry Phosphatidylcholines ( PCs ) are the most abundant glycerophospholipids in mammalian cells , accounting for more than 30 % of the total lipid content ( 1 ) . PCs com - prise a glycerol phosphate backbone with a choline head group attached at the sn - 3 position and two fatty acid moi - eties at positions sn - 1 and sn - 2 . PCs are rather heteroge - neous and have diverse physical properties , because they engage a variety of fatty acids having different numbers of carbon atoms and double bonds . In mammalian cells , PCs are synthesized via the CDP - cho - line pathway or via the phosphatidylethanolamine meth - ylation pathway ( 2 – 4 ) . Further metabolism involves remod - eling processes , which are controlled by the coordinated action of acyltransferases , transacylases , and lipases ( 5 ) . Inhibiting the CDP - choline pathway is lethal ( 6 , 7 ) and is not compensated by the alternative phosphatidylethanola - mine methylation pathway , presumably because different PC species are produced ( 8 , 9 ) . The majority of de novo synthesized PCs are believed to comprise saturated fatty acids at the position sn - 1 and unsaturated fatty acids at the position sn - 2 ( 10 , 11 ) , although they might be altered by subsequent remodeling ( 12 – 14 ) . Certain cellular compartments and membrane micro - domains are distinguished by a characteristic composition of PCs , in which very long chain , or saturated , or highly unsaturated fatty acid moieties prevail ( 15 – 19 ) . To under - stand how the speciﬁc lipid composition of cellular com - partments or microdomains might impinge on a variety of biological processes , it is important to characterize PCs as individual molecular species , i . e . , to identify the fatty acid moieties and their exact location at the glycerol back - bone . Electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry is a sensitive and speciﬁc tool for the characterization of PCs in total Abbreviations : FAS , fatty acid scanning ; lysoPC , lyso - phosphatidyl - choline ; M , mass of a zwitterionic PC ; PC , phosphatidylcholine ; PIS , precursor ion scanning ; PIS m / z 184 . 1 , scanning for precursor ions that produce a fragment ion with m / z 184 . 1 upon collision - induced dissoci - ation ; QqTOF , quadrupole time - of - ﬂight ; [ R (cid:2) CH 2 COO ] (cid:3) , acyl anion of a fatty acid with hydrocarbon moiety R (cid:2) ; X / Y - PC - PC , PC molecule with X fatty acid moiety at sn - 1 position of the glycerol backbone , and Y fatty acid moiety at sn - 2 position ; { X ; Y } - PC , PC molecule ( or a mixture of iso - meric molecules ) comprising fatty acids X and Y at unidentiﬁed posi - tion of the backbone . 1 K .

Because of the positively charged quaternary amine of the choline head group , PCs are readily detected in positive ion mode with the femtomole sensitivity ( 23 ) . Collision - induced dissociation of cations of PCs yields a characteristic fragment of the phos - phorylcholine moiety having m / z 184 . 1 , which enables their quantitative proﬁling in unprocessed lipid extracts by pre - cursor ion scanning ( 23 ) . Because the fragmentation of sphingomyelins yields the same fragment , PIS m / z 184 . 1 simultaneously detects both PCs and sphingomyelins . Monoprotonated molecular ions of PCs have even nomi - nal masses , whereas ions of sphingomyelins have odd nominal masses and , if not detected in partly overlapping peak clusters , could easily be distinguished . Being very sensitive and speciﬁc , PIS m / z 184 . 1 does not determine the fatty acid composition of analyzed PCs directly . Al - though the total number of carbon atoms and double bonds in both fatty acid chains can be calculated from the intact masses of PC precursors , it is not possible to tell which fatty acids were comprised in isobaric PCs and to es - timate the relative amount of their molecular forms . Hybrid quadrupole time - of - ﬂight ( QqTOF ) mass spec - trometers can simultaneously acquire precursor ion scan - ning ( PIS ) spectra for a virtually unlimited number of fragment ions ( 24 ) . The sensitivity of PIS on QqTOF mass spectrometers is inherently limited by the duty cycle ( 25 ) , but was signiﬁcantly improved by trapping fragment ions in the collision cell and pulse - releasing them into the TOF analyzer ( 26 ) . This sensitivity became comparable with the sensitivity of triple quadrupole machines ( 24 , 27 ) , which currently are the most widely used instruments in mass spectrometric analysis of lipids ( 28 ) . Collision - induced dissociation of anions of glycerophos - pholipids yields abundant acyl anions of fatty acid moi - eties ( 20 , 22 , 29 – 32 ) . Selecting masses of acyl anion frag - ments for multiple precursor ion scanning on a QqTOF instrument enables the proﬁling of the fatty acid composi - tion of individual glycerophospholipids in lipid extracts , a method termed fatty acid scanning ( FAS ) ( 27 ) . However , FAS only covers glycerophospholipids that are detectable in negative ion mode with high sensitivity and therefore is not directly applicable to proﬁling PCs . FAS accurately determines the fatty acid composition of a par - ticular lipid , and the position of fatty acid moieties ( sn - 1 or sn - 2 ) could , in principle , be inferred from the ratio of intensities of peaks of acyl anions . However , the relative quantiﬁcation becomes ambiguous if a fragmented pre - cursor is a mixture of isobaric species , which might belong to the same class or to different classes of lipids . In this paper , we present an analytical strategy for quantita - tive proﬁling of PCs by a combination of FAS on a QqTOF mass spectrometer and MS 3 fragmentation on an ion trap mass spectrometer . Millimolar concentrations of ammonium salts in the electrosprayed analyte enabled sensitive detection of PCs as negatively charged adducts , which can be directly analyzed by FAS . MS 3 fragmentation of adducts on an ion trap mass spectrometer allowed us to quantify the relative abundance of positional isomers . The analysis of lipid ex - tracts from Madin - Darby canine kidney II ( MDCK II ) cells and human red blood cells characterized the pool of PCs as a complex mixture of isobaric and isomeric species . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials and lipid standards Synthetic PC standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lip - ids , Inc . ( Alabaster , AL ) . Chloroform and methanol were liquid chromatography grade from Merck ( Darmstadt , Germany ) . Am - monium acetate and ammonium chloride were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Cell media were from Gibco BRL ( Rockville , MD ) . Fetal calf serum ( FCS ) was from PAA Lab - oratories GmbH , ( Cölbe , Germany ) , and phospholipase A 2 ( PLA 2 ) was from Crotalus atrox venom from Sigma . Nanoelectrospray capillaries ( brand “short” ) were purchased from Proxeon Biosys - tems A / S ( Odense , Denmark ) . Preparation of MDCK II cells and human red blood cells MDCK II cells were maintained in supplemented MEM ( in - cluding 5 % FCS , 2 mM glutamine , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 (cid:4) g / ml streptomycin ) in 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:5) C in a humidiﬁed incuba - tor . Cells were grown on 10 cm plastic dishes to (cid:2) 90 % conﬂu - ence . MDCK II cells were washed three times with PBS buffer be - fore being scraped and pelleted in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube for 5 min at 14 , 000 g at room temperature . Cell pellets were snap fro - zen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:3) 20 (cid:5) C . Human red blood cells were pooled by centrifugation for 10 min at 200 g at 4 (cid:5) C and washed 5 times with cold 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 . Cells were aliquoted into 2 ml Eppen - dorf tubes , snap frozen , and stored at (cid:3) 80 (cid:5) C . Lipid extraction was performed according to Folch , Lees , and Sloane - Stanley ( 33 ) . Brieﬂy , 500 (cid:4) l methanol was added to a 75 (cid:4) l cell suspension and vortexed for 10 min , followed by addition of 1 ml chloroform and vortexing for further 10 min . The sam - ple was centrifuged for 5 min at 14 , 000 g at room temperature . The supernatant was transferred to a new tube , and 300 (cid:4) l water was added , followed by stirring the mixture for 10 min . Samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at 20 (cid:5) C . The lower phase ( or - ganic ) was transferred to a new tube and washed with chloro - form - methanol - water ( 3 : 48 : 47 ; v / v / v ) . The phases were sepa - rated , and the organic phase was transferred to a new tube . The sample was dried in a vacuum concentrator and stored at (cid:3) 20 (cid:5) C . Hydrolysis by PLA 2 Synthetic PC standards and their mixtures were hydrolysed by PLA 2 as described by Kates ( 34 ) . Brieﬂy , 500 nmol of dried PC standard was dissolved in 800 (cid:4) l diethyl ether - methanol ( 99 : 1 ; v / v ) and mixed with 450 (cid:4) l of aqueous solution containing 40 mM calcium chloride , 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 7 (cid:4) g PLA 2 . Mix - tures were vigorously vortexed for 5 h and then dried in a vac - uum concentrator . Dried samples were extracted and prepared for mass spectrometric analysis as described below . Sample preparation for mass spectrometric analysis The concentration of PCs in stock solutions was determined by the phosphorous assay described by Rouser , Fkeischer , and Yamamoto ( 35 ) . Standards were prepared in different concen - trations and molar ratios in chloroform - methanol ( 1 : 2 ; v / v ) con - taining 5 mM ammonium acetate or ammonium chloride . Dried total lipid extracts from MDCK II cells and from red blood cells were redissolved in 50 – 100 (cid:4) l chloroform - methanol ( 1 : 2 ; v / v ) . Prior to mass spectrometric analysis , sample aliquots were di - luted 10 - fold in chloroform - methanol ( 1 : 2 ; v / v ) containing an ammonium salt at a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM . Ekroos et al . Molecular composition of phosphatidylcholines 2183 QqTOF mass spectrometry Precursor ion scanning was performed on a modiﬁed QSTAR Pulsar i QqTOF mass spectrometer ( MDS Sciex , Concord , ON , Canada ) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source ( Proxeon Biosystems A / S , Odense , Denmark ) as previously described ( 27 ) . In both positive and negative ion modes , the analytical quadru - pole Q1 was operated at unit resolution and 20 msec dwell time with a step size of 0 . 1 Th . Peak enhancement ( trapping of frag - ment ions of the selected m / z in the collision cell ) was applied ac - cording to the instructions of the manufacturer and was con - trolled via Analyst QS software . The characteristic fragment ion of phosphorylcholine , m / z 184 . 1 , was selected for detection of PCs and lyso - phosphatidylcholines ( lysoPCs ) in positive ion mode . For FAS of PC standards , precur - sor ion spectra of the two acyl anion fragments of the fatty acid moieties were acquired . For FAS analysis of lipid extracts , precur - sor ion spectra were simultaneously acquired for 30 – 50 acyl an - ion fragments of fatty acid moieties , containing 12 to 22 carbon atoms and 0 to 6 double bonds . Collision energy was set at 40 eV in positive and negative ion mode , unless speciﬁed otherwise . Fragment ions were selected within an m / z window of 0 . 15 Th . Peak intensities were maintained below 750 counts per scan to avoid saturation of the detector . FAS spectra were interpreted us - ing a beta - version of LipidProﬁler 1 . 0 software ( MDX Sciex ) . Ion trap mass spectrometry MS n fragmentation was performed on a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer LCQ ( Finnigan ThermoQuest , San Jose , CA ) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source ( Proxeon Biosys - tems A / S ) . Approximately 3 (cid:4) l of the analyte was loaded into lab - oratory - made , gold - coated glass capillaries and sprayed at (cid:3) 900 to (cid:3) 1 , 000 V . The temperature of the heated transfer - capillary was 180 (cid:5) C , the capillary voltage was (cid:3) 15 V , and the tube lens was (cid:3) 15 V . Spectra were averaged over 10 – 50 scans , each scan con - sisting of three microscans . For MS 2 and MS 3 fragmentation , pre - cursor ions were selected using an isolation width of 5 Th and 2 Th , respectively . The relative collision energy was set between 16 % and 22 % . RESULTS Quantiﬁcation of positional isomers of synthetic PC standards To quantify positional isomers of endogenous PCs , we ﬁrst established the isomeric purity of available synthetic standards . PLA 2 hydrolyses the sn - 2 ester bond in PCs , yielding 2 - lysoPCs . We tested PLA 2 speciﬁcity by hydrolyz - ing 15 mg of synthetic 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 - PC standard and analyz - ing the reaction mixture by 1 H - NMR . We detected only the signal from hydrogen atoms of the secondary alcohol , not that from the primary alcohol , which indicated that the sn - 1 ester bond was not hydrolyzed to any noticeable extent ( data not shown ) . We therefore concluded that un - der the applied reaction conditions , the hydrolysis of the sn - 2 ester bond by PLA 2 is speciﬁc . Mass spectrometric analysis of PLA 2 - treated PC stan - dards on a QqTOF mass spectrometer by TOF MS and by PIS m / z 184 . 1 suggested that they contained a noticeable amount of positional isomers as presented in correspond - ing columns in Table 1 ( mol % determined by FAS and ion trap MS 3 fragmentation of the same standard PCs is also presented in Table 1 and discussed below ) . MS / MS fragmentation of anion adducts of PCs on a QqTOF mass spectrometer Because phosphorylcholine moiety comprises a quater - nary amino group , high sensitivity detection of PCs in negative ion mode is problematic . Spiking 5 mM ammo - nium acetate or chloride into an electrosprayed solution of PCs rendered anion adducts [ M (cid:6) CH 3 COO ] (cid:3) and / or [ M (cid:6) Cl ] (cid:3) ( 21 , 22 , 36 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Upon collision - induced dissociation , anion adducts of PC ions lose both a methyl group from the choline moiety and the counter ion , yielding a fragment ion ( designated as [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) ) with m / z 15 Th smaller than the mass of the zwitterionic form of the intact PC ( Fig . 1 ) . The [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) ions undergo further fragmentation via formation of low abundant intermediates by either neutral loss of free fatty acid [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) R (cid:2) CH 2 COOH ] (cid:3) or neutral loss of ketene [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) R (cid:2) CH (cid:7) C (cid:7) O ] (cid:3) , or by yielding acyl anions of fatty acids directly . A similar pattern of fragment ions was observed in MS / MS analysis of PCs ( 21 ) as well as of other glycerophospholipids on a triple quadrupole instrument ( 29 – 32 ) . The acyl anion fragment of sn - 2 fatty acid was more abundant than the fatty acid at sn - 1 position . We further examined the way in which the intensity of fragments depends on the applied collision energy ( Fig . 2 ) . At low collision energy ( (cid:2) 30 eV ) , MS / MS spectra were dominated by the intact precursor ion and the [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) fragment of the demethylated PC . With increasing colli - sion energy , the intensity of both precursor and [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) ions decreased , with concomitantly increasing intensity of acyl anion fragments . The intensity of acyl anions peaked at (cid:2) 50 eV and then decreased , presumably because high collision energy compromised focusing and steering of the ion beam in the mass spectrometer . In the range of 40 – 60 eV , altering the collision energy had almost no impact on the yield of acyl anions and , consequently , no tuning of the collision energy was required for optimizing the sensitivity . Proﬁling of PCs by FAS Because acyl anions of fatty acid moieties are efﬁciently produced by collision - induced dissociation of anion ad - ducts of PCs , they could be directly proﬁled by FAS , simi - TABLE 1 .

FAS analysis of 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 - PC and 18 : 1 / 16 : 0 - PC standards was performed by selecting m / z 255 . 2 and 281 . 2 , correspond - ing to acyl anions of palmitic acid ( 16 : 0 ) and oleic acid ( 18 : 1 ) , respectively , and precursor ions of acetate and chloride adducts were detected ( Fig . 3 ) . As expected , in the fragment patterns in MS / MS spectra of adducts ( Fig . 1 ) , the peak of the precursor ion was more abundant in FAS for the acyl anion fragment of sn - 2 fatty acid than of sn - 1 fatty acid . The ratio of their intensities did not de - pend on the mode of analysis and pinpointed the major component in the mixture of positional isomers . The plot of areas of precursor peaks in different precursor scans was linear in the 0 . 4 – 7 (cid:4) M concentration range and was not affected when PC standards were spiked into a lipid extract ( data not shown ) . PLA 2 - treated PC standards were subjected to FAS , which demonstrated that lysoPCs were also detectable as acetate and chloride adduct ions ( data not shown ) . Fur - ther analysis of precursor ion peak areas demonstrated that FAS produced a quantitatively consistent estimation of the mol % of related positional isomers ( Table 1 ) . MS n fragmentation of PC adducts on an ion trap mass spectrometer Regardless of the applied collision energy , fragmenta - tion of anion adducts of PCs on the QqTOF mass spec - trometer did not produce ions that could directly charac - terize the relative abundance of isomeric PC species ( Fig . 1 ) . In contrast with tandem mass spectrometers equipped with a linear collision cell ( e . g . , triple quadrupole or QqTOF instruments ) , ion trap mass spectrometers fragment a pre - cursor ion by applying an m / z - dependent resonance exci - tation voltage , which leaves product ions unaffected . If necessary , any product ion can be further trapped and frag - mented in another cycle of the tandem mass spectrometric experiment ( MS n experiments ) [ as reviewed in ref . ( 37 ) ] . We tested whether fragmenting anion adducts of PCs in an ion trap mass spectrometer would enable direct quanti - ﬁcation of positional isomers . MS 2 fragmentation of the chloride adduct of 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 - PC standard produced abun - dant ions of a demethylated fragment of PC [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) at m / z 744 ( Fig . 4 ) . Subsequently , MS 3 fragmentation of [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) resulted in neutral loss of the fatty acids as ketene [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) R (cid:2) CH (cid:7) C (cid:7) O ] (cid:3) , rendering product ions of demeth - ylated lysoPCs at m / z 480 and 506 , with the peak of the former product as the most abundant . Acyl anion frag - ments [ R (cid:2) CH 2 COO ] (cid:3) were observed at m / z 255 and 281 , although they were less abundant than in QqTOF spectra . Minor fragments formed by neutral loss of free fatty acid [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) R (cid:2) CH 2 COOH ] (cid:3) from [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) were detected at m / z 462 and 488 . As expected , MS 4 fragmentation of the demethylated lysoPCs produced the acyl anion frag - ment and corresponding products of ketene and free fatty acid losses at m / z 242 and 224 , respectively ( data not shown ) . Ion trap MS n analysis of other PC standards followed the same fragmentation pathways ( data not shown ) . MS 3 fragmentation of the isomeric standard 18 : 1 / 16 : 0 - PC produced a spectrum in which the intensities of frag - ment ions were reversed , compared with the spectrum of 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 - PC standard ( Fig . 4 ) , suggesting that fragmenta - tion pathways in ion trap and QqTOF mass spectrometers are similar ( Fig . 5 ) and implying that release of fatty acids either as acyl anions or as neutral ketenes is a position - dependent process . Quantitative analysis of positional isomers by MS 3 fragmentation MS 3 fragmentation of PC adducts yielded abundant demethylated lysoPC fragment ions , matching the neutral loss of sn - 2 fatty acid as ketene , that could be employed in direct quantiﬁcation of isomeric and isobaric species . We therefore evaluated whether the relative intensity of these ions correlated with the estimates of mol % of isomeric species determined by PLA 2 hydrolysis of synthetic stan - dards . The ratio of intensities of demethylated lysoPC fragment ions rendered via neutral loss of fatty acids as ketenes ( i . e . , [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) R (cid:2) CH (cid:7) C (cid:7) O ] (cid:3) ) correlated with the estimates of mol % determined by the other three in - dependent methods of detection ( Table 1 ) . To further val - idate the method , we mixed pairs of isomeric standards in various molar ratios , digested aliquots of the mixtures by Fig . 1 . A : TOF MS spectrum of synthetic 18 : 1 / 18 : 0 - phosphatidyl - choline ( PC ) standard in chloroform - methanol ( 1 : 2 ) containing 5 mM ammonium acetate ( note that the standard contained (cid:2) 19 % of the isomeric 18 : 0 / 18 : 1 - PC , Table 1 ) . PC was detected as anions of acetate and chloride adducts at m / z 846 . 62 and m / z 822 . 57 , re - spectively . B : MS / MS spectrum of the acetate adduct at m / z 846 . 62 acquired at collision energy 40 eV . Peaks at m / z 772 . 59 , 283 . 26 , and 281 . 25 correspond to the fragment ion of demethylated PC ( [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) ) and acyl anions of stearic and oleic acid , respectively . Low abundant fragments were produced by the loss of fatty acids as ketenes [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) C 16 H 31 CH (cid:7) C (cid:7) O ] (cid:3) ( m / z 508 . 34 ) and [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) C 16 H 33 CH (cid:7) C (cid:7) O ] (cid:3) ( m / z 506 . 32 ) and by neutral loss of free fatty acids [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) C 16 H 31 CH 2 COOH ] (cid:3) ( m / z 490 . 34 ) and [ M (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) C 16 H 33 CH 2 COOH ] (cid:3) ( m / z 488 . 32 ) . Ekroos et al . Molecular composition of phosphatidylcholines 2185 PLA 2 , and determined the content of positional isomers on the QqTOF mass spectrometer . Aliquots of the mix - tures of standards were analyzed directly by MS 3 fragmen - tation , and the results were compared . Linear regression demonstrated a statistically conﬁdent correlation between the obtained mol % estimates ( Fig . 6 ) . The same experi - ment was performed using another pair of isomeric stan - dards , 16 : 0 / 18 : 0 - PC and 18 : 0 / 16 : 0 - PC , and produced sim - ilar results ( data not shown ) . Taken together , the data indicated that neutral loss of fatty acid as ketene predomi - nantly occurs at the sn - 2 position . The intensity of other fragments or a combination of in - tensities of fragments observed in MS 3 spectra did not cor - relate well with the mol % of the isomers , most likely be - cause the yield of fragments from other fragmentation pathways is less position - speciﬁc than that of ketene loss . Further supporting this notion , we found that lyso - phos - phatidic acid fragments formed by loss of ketene from the sn - 2 position enabled accurate estimates of mol % in mix - tures of 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 and 18 : 1 / 16 : 0 phosphatidic acid , al - though they were much less abundant than fragment ions produced by neutral loss of free fatty acid ( C . Ejsing , K . Ekroos , and A . Shevchenko , unpublished observations ) . Validation of the mass spectrometric approach The lipid composition and major molecular species of glycerophospholipids of human red blood cells were pre - viously rigorously characterized ( 38 ) by a sophisticated an - alytical routine that involved several TLC separations , hy - drolysis of lipids by phospholipase C , and derivatization of diradylglycerols by benzoic anhydride followed by quanti - ﬁcation of diradylglycerolbenzoates by reversed - phase HPLC ( 39 ) . Diradylglycerolbenzoates were separated into 20 chromatographic peaks ( some of which contained a few coeluted species ) ; however , separation of positional iso - mers was not achieved ( 39 ) . To further validate our mass spectrometric approach , we determined the molecular composition of PCs from human red blood cells ( Table 2 ) and compared it with the results previously reported by Connor et al . ( 38 ) . Connor et al . identiﬁed 26 molecular species of PCs by HPLC , and 22 species were identiﬁed in the present work by a combination of PIS m / z 184 . 1 and FAS . We note that we did not acquire precursor ion spectra for acyl anions of a few minor fatty acids ( e . g . , 22 : 6 ) , although Connor et al . found corresponding lipids . Within the datasets ob - tained independently by Connor et al . and by us ( Table 2 ) , 14 molecular species overlapped . All nonoverlapping species were of low abundance , and their relative content was (cid:8) 3 mol % . All eight major PC species with relative content (cid:9) 3 mol % that were reported by Connor et al . were also detected by mass spectrometry , with similar rel - Fig . 2 .

Furthermore , ion trap MS 3 analysis of major PC species suggested that positional isomers ( which remained undetected by Connor et al . ) are com - mon in human red blood cells ( Table 2 ) . For example , 20 : 4 / 16 : 0 - PC , having a highly unsaturated arachidonic acid at the sn - 1 position , constitutes about 13 mol % of the total 36 : 4 - PC . Connor et al . detected one PC species comprising a fatty acid with an odd number of carbon atoms , { 17 : 0 / 18 : 1 } - PC . Mass spectrometry conﬁrmed that 17 : 0 and 17 : 1 are major fatty acids with an odd number of carbons that are present in PCs from red blood cells , and we also de - tected them in another three molecular species ( Table 2 ) . We therefore concluded that qualitative and quantita - tive concordance of the molecular composition of PCs de - termined by us and independently by Connor et al . vali - dates the mass spectrometry - based approach . Molecular composition of PCs from MDCK II cells The MDCK II cell line is an established model for study - ing the biogenesis of epithelial surface polarity and the mechanisms of polarized protein and lipid sorting . Here we applied a combination of FAS and MS 3 fragmentation to characterize the molecular composition of PCs in a to - tal lipid extract . Lipid extracts of MDCK II cells were ﬁrst analyzed in positive ion mode by PIS m / z 184 . 1 to detect PCs . The to - tal number of carbon atoms and double bonds in fatty acid moieties was calculated from intact masses of de - tected precursors ( Table 3 ) . The same sample was further analyzed by FAS in negative ion mode . Fifty precursor ion scan spectra of acyl anions of fatty acids were matched to the spectrum of PIS m / z 184 . 1 by LipidProﬁler 1 . 0 soft - ware , which allowed us to determine the fatty acid compo - sition of all detected PC species ( Table 3 ) . Complementing PIS m / z 184 . 1 by FAS allowed us to re - solve ambiguous precursor ion assignments . For example , a minor peak at m / z 748 . 5 was detected by PIS m / z 184 . 1 . It was not obvious whether the peak belonged to 33 : 0 - PC , be - cause it overlapped with the second isotopic peak of abun - dant 33 : 1 - PC at m / z 746 . 5 ( Fig . 7 ) . Nevertheless , FAS iden - tiﬁed 33 : 0 - PC species as { 16 : 0 ; 17 : 0 } - PC and { 15 : 0 ; 18 : 0 } - PC . In total lipid extract of MDCK II cells , we identiﬁed 15 PC species ( not including positional isomers ) comprising fatty acid moieties with an odd number of carbon atoms , al - though this was rather unexpected , considering the known pathways of de novo lipid biosynthesis in mammalian cells . We further performed ion trap MS 3 analysis on the most abundant PCs ( Table 2 ) . For example , FAS indicated that 32 : 1 - PC ( m / z 766 . 8 ) consists of { 16 : 0 ; 16 : 1 } - PC , { 15 : 0 ; 17 : 1 } - Fig . 4 .

The spectrum is similar to that in panel B , but the intensities of fragments at m / z 506 and 480 , as well as at m / z 281 and 255 , are reversed . Ekroos et al . Molecular composition of phosphatidylcholines 2187 PC , and { 14 : 0 ; 18 : 1 } - PC . MS 3 analysis conﬁrmed the fatty acid assignment and enabled us to determine that 16 : 0 / 16 : 1 - PC and 16 : 1 / 16 : 0 - PC constitute 33 and 55 mol % of the total 32 : 1 - PC , respectively , with other species account - ing for 3 to 6 mol % ( Table 3 ) . We reasoned that the pres - ence of a sizable proportion of positional isomers in PCs is likely to represent a common phenomenon rather than a speciﬁc feature of a particular MDCK II cell line . We note here that m / z of PC species with fatty acids hav - ing an odd number of carbon atoms might coincide with Fig . 5 . Fragmentation pathways of the anion adduct of PC under low - energy collision - induced dissociation . In the ﬁrst step of collision - induced dissociation of the PC adduct anion ( e . g . , [ M (cid:6) Cl ] (cid:3) ) , the demethylated fragment ion [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) is produced . Fragmentation of the [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) ion proceeds along three major path - ways : ( I ) , loss of sn - 2 fatty acid as a ketene yields a demethylated 2 - lysoPC ; ( II ) and ( III ) , formation of acyl an - ions of sn - 2 and sn - 1 fatty acids ; and three minor pathways : ( IV ) , loss of sn - 1 fatty acid as a ketene ; ( V ) and ( VI ) , loss of neutral fatty acid from sn - 2 and sn - 1 positions .

However , in the MS / MS spectrum of synthetic 1 - O - hexa - decyl - 2 - arachidonoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - PC standard , no corre - sponding alkoxide ion at m / z 241 . 25 was observed ( data not shown ) . Therefore , alkoxide anions of ether lipids will not be detectable by FAS and will not compromise the conﬁdence of peak assignment in FAS spectra . PC peaks in which only a single acyl anion was identiﬁed , and in which the complementary fatty acid with an odd number of carbon atoms was not detected , will indicate the pres - ence of ether species . Taken together , PIS m / z 184 . 1 , FAS , and ion trap MS 3 fragmentation revealed high complexity of the molecular composition of PCs represented by a va - riety of isomeric and isobaric species . DISCUSSION PCs can be detected at the low (cid:4) M – nM sensitivity as anion acetate or chloride adducts , which produce structure - spe - ciﬁc ions upon tandem mass spectrometric fragmentation . Regardless of the type of instrument , collision - induced dissociation of an anionic adduct ﬁrst generates abundant [ M (cid:3) 15 ] (cid:3) fragments whose subsequent fragmentation pathways are common for negatively charged glycerophos - pholipids ( 29 – 32 , 36 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . The different fragment patterns observed in QqTOF MS / MS and ion trap MS 2 , MS 3 , and MS 4 originate in mechanisms by which the collision energy is transmitted to selected precursor ions and affects the yield of unstable intermediates . It is therefore not surprising that the frag - mentation of PC adducts in a QqTOF instrument at high collision energy predominantly yielded acyl anion frag - ments of fatty acids , whereas abundant peaks of demeth - ylated lysoPCs were observed in MS 3 ion trap spectra . The inspection of fragmentation pathways by ion trap MS 3 revealed that they have different positional speciﬁcity ( Fig . 5 ) . Neutral loss of fatty acid as ketene accounts for (cid:2) 58 % of the total intensity of fragment ions and occurs almost exclusively via the cleavage of sn - 2 fatty acid ( (cid:2) 99 % of ketene fragment ions ) , thus generating demeth - ylated 2 - lysoPC . Its yield does not depend on the fatty acid moieties , as is evident from the accurate estimation of mol % of isomeric species comprising different combina - tions of fatty acids ( Table 1 and Fig . 6 ) . Acyl anion frag - ments are abundant in MS 3 spectra ( (cid:2) 39 % of the total fragment ion intensity ) and are mostly ( although not ex - clusively ! ) produced from the sn - 2 fatty acid ( 80 % of in - tensity of acyl anion fragments ) . Neutral loss of free fatty acid appears to be a relatively minor process that accounts for about 2 % of the total fragment ion intensity . Relative ( in mol % ) quantiﬁcation of isobaric and iso - meric PC species by ion trap MS 3 fragmentation is direct TABLE 2 .

The determina - tion is very speciﬁc because of the accurate selection of precursor masses at MS 2 and MS 3 stages and therefore is reliable even if applied to total lipid extracts . Further - more , matching pairs of demethylated 2 - lysoPCs and acyl anion fragments of sn - 2 fatty acid additionally verify the peak assignment . At the same time , MS 3 fragmentation is poorly suited for the detection of PC precursors in lipid mixtures , as well as for the quantiﬁcation of PC species with different molecular masses . Because no efﬁcient precursor ion scanning is possible on ion trap mass spectrometers , complementary analysis by QqTOF mass spectrometry and by ion trap mass spectrometry should be used in concert . We applied FAS on a QqTOF mass spectrometer and MS 3 fragmentation on the ion trap mass spectrometer to characterize the molecular composition of PCs . FAS com - plemented the previously established method of PIS m / z 184 . 1 and not only increased the speciﬁcity and the dy - namic range of detection but also allowed us to identify the fatty acid moieties and their relative localization on the glycerol backbone of the individual PC molecules .

Because a combi - nation of mass spectrometric methods could account for individual molecular species of PCs , we assumed that this is currently the most detailed and comprehensive ap - proach for their characterization . A combination of FAS and MS 3 was applied to proﬁle PCs in a lipid extract from MDCK II cells . The conven - tional analysis by PIS m / z 184 . 1 detected 25 peaks of iso - baric PCs ( Table 3 ) . Further analysis of the same sample by FAS revealed that they represent 46 species with unique fatty acid composition . MS 3 fragmentation of the most abundant peaks suggested that they are mixtures of posi - tional isomers , and therefore the total number of molecu - lar species is close to 100 . We note that although we de - tected no sizeable amount of ether PCs , we could not exclude that they might be present in the extract ( 40 ) but were masked by more abundant species . Although PCs of MDCK II cells and human red blood cells have been extensively characterized , no indication of the possible presence of positional isomers has been re - ported ( 41 ) . Biochemical studies have shown that fatty acid remodeling is a common phenomenon in eukaryotic organisms ( 5 ) , which potentially accounts for the observed presence of isomeric lipid species . Biophysical studies have demonstrated that positional isomers display different types of phase behavior and have differences in phase tran - sition temperatures ( 42 , 43 ) . Importantly , positional iso - mers differ in their ability to interact with sterols , thus af - fecting the dynamics of membrane microdomains . With the analytical tools now available , the biological role of the observed complexity can be evaluated in molecular detail . Charting the molecular composition of PCs ( and , con - ceivably , of other glycerophospolipids ) by mass spectrom - etry has several advantages over conventional methods . A combination of head group scanning ( PIS m / z 184 . 1 ) , FAS , and ion trap MS 3 fragmentation provided the most detailed and comprehensive characterization of the mo - lecular composition , including the relative quantiﬁcation of individual molecular species . The sensitivity of detec - tion was at the low picomole – femtomole level . The sam - ple preparation routine was vastly simpliﬁed and did not require preliminary separation of lipid classes and of indi - vidual molecular species , enzymatic digestion , or chemi - cal derivatization . In FAS , m / z of acyl anions can be se - lected with high accuracy , thus increasing the dynamic range and the speciﬁcity of detection of corresponding lipid precursors . Therefore , glycerophospholipids com - prising fatty acid moieties of possible medical diagnostic interest [ such as very long chain fatty acids ( 16 ) , fatty ac - ids having an odd number of carbon atoms ( 44 ) , etc . ] can be reliably detected and quantiﬁed in total extracts in the presence of overwhelming amounts of lipids with more - prevalent fatty acid moieties . It is therefore conceivable that upon further development , this technology will pave the way for high throughput “shotgun lipidomics , ” the ap - proach in which molecular species of multiple lipid classes will be identiﬁed and quantiﬁed by computer pro - cessing of a very large number of simultaneously acquired precursor ion scans for m / z of characteristic fragments , in - Fig . 7 . In PIS m / z 184 . 1 , the peak of 33 : 0 - PC ( m / z 748 . 5 ) overlaps with the second isotope peak of abundant 33 : 1 - PC ( m / z 746 . 5 ) ( inset ) . FAS ( zoomed ) suggested that 33 : 1 - PC is a mixture of { 15 : 0 ; 18 : 1 } - , { 16 : 0 ; 17 : 1 } - , and { 17 : 0 ; 16 : 1 } - PCs ( only representative precursor scans are presented in the ﬁgure ) . At the same time , FAS identi - ﬁed 33 : 0 - PC as { 16 : 0 ; 17 : 0 } - and { 15 : 0 ; 18 : 0 } - PCs . Fifty precursor ion scan spectra were simultaneously acquired in the FAS experiment .
