Androgens have been proposed to regulate the physiology governing these investments . Furthermore , androgens are hypothesized to play a central role in carotenoid - dependent sexual signaling , regulating how much carotenoids are diverted to ornamentation and away from somatic maintenance , increasing oxidative stress , and accelerating aging . We investigated these relationships in male three - spined stickleback in which we elevated 11 - ketotestosterone and supplied vitamin E , an antioxidant , in a 2 × 2 design . Androgen elevation shortened the time stickleback maintained reproductive activities . We suspect that this effect is caused by 11 - ketotestosterone stimulating investment in current reproduction , but we detected no evidence for this in our measurements of reproductive effort : nest building , body composition , and breeding coloration . Carotenoid - dependent coloration was even slightly decreased by 11 - ketotestosterone elevation and was left unaffected by vitamin E . Red coloration correlated with life expectancy and reproductive capacity in a quadratic manner , suggesting overinvestment of the individuals exhibiting the reddest bellies . In contrast , blue iris color showed a negative relationship with survival , suggesting physiological costs of producing this aspect of nuptial coloration . In conclusion , our results support the hypothesis that androgens regulate investment in current versus future reproduction , yet the precise mechanisms remain elusive . The quadratic relationships between sexual signal expression and aspects of quality have wider consequences for how we view sexual selection on ornamentation and its relationship with aging .

Such resource - based trade - offs are central to life - history theory ( Stearns , 1989 ) and have been adopted throughout biology , including the biology of aging ( Maklakov and Chapman , 2019 ) . Questions concerning , for example , the optimal arrival time at breeding sites ( Kokko , 1999 ) , litter size ( Dijkstra et al . , 1990 ; Sikes et al . , 1998 ) , foraging effort ( Abrams , 1991 ) , dietary restriction Edited by : Alan A .

Biol . 9 : 752352 . doi : 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2021 . 752352 Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org December 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 752352 1 ORIGINAL RESEARCH published : 17 December 2021 doi : 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2021 . 752352 ( McCracken et al . , 2020a ) , and prey choice ( Rutten et al . , 2006 ) can all be explained in a framework of ﬁ tness costs and bene ﬁ ts . A central or arguably ultimate cost in life history and the biology of aging is the cost of reproduction ( Reznick et al . , 2000 ; Lemaître et al . , 2015 ) . If there are no costs of producing offspring , why not simply produce more offspring to increase ﬁ tness ? The most direct test of these “ costs of reproduction ” is to increase reproductive effort experimentally and measure the long - term ﬁ tness consequences for the parents . In birds , this approach , by manipulating clutch or brood size , has been used many times . Yet , despite there being some undisputed demonstrations ( Daan et al . , 1990 ; Tinbergen and Daan , 1990 ) of costs of reproduction , a recent meta - analysis of 29 studies ( Santos and Nakagawa , 2012 ) found that parental effort was associated with survival only in males , but not in females , with notably small overall effect sizes . Possibly , the ﬁ tness costs of parental effort are not traded off exclusively against future survival but also to future reproduction . Alternatively , the costs of an increased brood size are mainly paid by the offspring . This notion is supported by the ﬁ nding that , in general , animals will not increase parental effort to such a degree that it fully compensates for the extra provisioning and care required by the offspring added , reducing offspring quality ( Dijkstra et al . , 1990 ; Simons et al . , 2011 ) . Indeed , the combined effects of brood enlargement studies on current reproduction , future reproduction , parental survival , and offspring ﬁ tness can reduce the total sum of ﬁ tness gained ( Smith et al . , 1989 ; Dijkstra et al . , 1990 ; Tinbergen and Daan , 1990 ) . Thus , whether the relationship between survival and investment in reproduction is causal and central in shaping the aging phenotype of animals remains less clear than current theory predicts . In Drosophila , more suitable for arti ﬁ cial selection experiments than vertebrates , a genetic relationship between reproduction and survival has been demonstrated ( Flatt , 2011 ) . Surprisingly , however , there are multiple examples of long - lived mutants or experimental manipulations in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans that extend lifespan without reduced or even increased fecundity ( Flatt , 2011 ; McCracken et al . , 2020b ; Yamamoto et al . , 2020 ; Lind et al . , 2021 ) . Note that these observations are made in the laboratory environment , and thus might not occur in the wild ( Briga and Verhulst , 2015 ) . Costs of reproduction therefore remain plausible but may be dif ﬁ cult to demonstrate or detect for different reasons . Physiological costs of reproduction may be context speci ﬁ c ( Simons et al . , 2014a ) , could be dif ﬁ cult to measure , or might be compensated or temporally dynamic . Costs are also central to sexual signaling theory ( Kotiaho , 2001 ; Számadó , 2011 ) , and the cost of sexual traits for acquiring fertilizations should be viewed as part of the cost of reproduction ( Höglund et al . , 1998 ) . According to the handicap hypothesis , mate choice for traits signaling male quality is only evolutionary stable when the trait bears costs , precluding cheating . Behavioral punishment ( Számadó , 2011 ) , energetic investment ( Grafen , 1990 ; Candolin , 1999 ) , mechanistic constraints ( Emlen et al . , 2012 ) , and speci ﬁ c resource investment ( Simons et al . , 2014b ) are mechanisms mediating the ﬁ tness cost of sexual signals . This diversity in the nature of costs may hamper detection of costs of sexual signals ( Svensson and Wong , 2011 ) , also because they may not be apparent in a laboratory setting where behavioral punishment is not possible , or because food is supplied ad libitum . In general , all investment into reproduction , sexual signaling , and otherwise should be viewed as investment into current reproduction ( Höglund et al . , 1998 ) , which is predicted to trade off with somatic maintenance and repair . It is this central trade - off that is persistently viewed as central in the biology of aging ﬁ eld , and forms the basis of the disposable soma theory of aging ( Kirkwood , 2002 ) . Investing in reproduction at the cost of somatic maintenance is usually optimal , because extrinsic mortality ( mortality that cannot be fully intrinsically controlled ) is almost never zero and investment into the soma is lost at death by an extrinsic cause ( Williams , 1957 ) . Any physiological investment that increases reproductive success is thus expected to reduce future reproduction either via accelerated mortality or via reproductive senescence . Given this connection between any physiological cost paid to enhance current reproductive success at the expense of future reproductive success , we may expect physiological regulators balancing these investment decisions . Hormones , and in particular sex hormones , have gathered considerable attention in this regard ( Hau , 2007 ; Regan et al . , 2019 ; Bell , 2020 ; Garratt et al . , 2020 ; Sugrue et al . , 2021 ) . In sexual signaling studies , testosterone speci ﬁ cally has attracted considerable attention for several reasons . First , the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis postulates that testosterone both suppresses the immune system and enhances expression of sexual traits and behavior ( Folstad and Karter , 1992 ; Sheldon and Verhulst , 1996 ) . Yet , evidence for direct immunosuppressive effects of testosterone is limited ( Roberts et al . , 2004 ) , but see Newhouse and Vernasco ( 2020 ) . In contrast , however , the reverse does hold , immune activation suppresses plasma testosterone , suggesting that testosterone plays a role in the trade - off between reproduction and somatic maintenance ( Boonekamp et al . , 2008 ) . Second , testosterone has been shown to elevate carotenoid - based coloration ( Blas et al . , 2006 ; Kurtz et al . , 2007 ; Perez - Rodriguez et al . , 2008 ; Khalil et al . , 2020 ) , thereby possibly mediating the trade - off between current reproductive effort and oxidative stress ( Schantz et al . , 1999 ) , induced by allocating carotenoids , an antioxidant [ but see Koch et al . ( 2018 ) and Koch and Hill ( 2018 ) ] , away from maintenance towards sexual signaling ( Peters , 2007 ; Svensson and Wong , 2011 ; Simons et al . , 2012a ) . The link between oxidative stress and carotenoid signaling has gained further support by the increases in coloration observed when antioxidants are supplemented , such as vitamin E in stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) ( Pike et al . , 2007a ) and in gulls ( Larus michahellis ) ( Pérez et al . , 2008 ) , but see Karu et al . ( 2008 ) and Giraudeau et al . ( 2013 ) . A trade - off concerning oxidative stress can also link testosterone to immune suppression , given that higher levels of oxidative stress are hypothesized to negatively affect immunity ( Kurtz et al . , 2007 ; Peters , 2007 ; Costantini and Møller , 2009 ) , but see Casagrande et al . ( 2012 ) and Newhouse and Vernasco ( 2020 ) . Third , testosterone has also been suggested to increase metabolic rate but evidence is mixed ( Buttemer et al . , Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org December 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 752352 2 Simons et al . Androgens and Costs of Reproduction 2008 ; Holtmann et al . , 2017 ) , yet could possibly enhance food intake and thereby carotenoid intake or growth of bodily extremities used as ornaments ( Mougeot et al . , 2004 ) . These multiple relationships between testosterone , physiology , and sexual signaling hamper the interpretation of negative ﬁ ndings on the trade - off between current and future reproductive success as costs may come about in physiological aspects other than those under study . Moreover , which and how physiology is altered by elevated testosterone may vary over time or cost may come to expression only later in life . Long - term experiments of the physiological consequences of elevated testosterone are therefore required . In several of such longer - term studies , testosterone has been shown to induce costs . Experimental elevation of testosterone in adult male brown - headed cowbirds ( Molothrus ater ) showed reduced return rates , and this has been explained by experiencing higher rates of aggression , because testosterone - implanted individuals also showed more signs of injury likely incurred during ﬁ ghting ( Dufty , 1989 ) . Male testosterone - implanted mountain spiny lizards ( Sceloporus jarrovi ) also show reduced survival , but this effect is negated by food supplementation , suggesting an energetic cost ( Marler and Moore , 1991 ) . Experimental elevation in males of another lizard species ( Psammodromus algirus ) also reduced survival and increased ectoparasitic infestation ( Salvador et al . , 1996 ) . In birds , survival of dark - eyed juncos ( Junco hyemalis ) ( Reed et al . , 2006 ) , red grouse ( Lagopus lagopus scoticus ) ( Moss et al . , 1994 ; Mougeot et al . , 2005 ; Redpath et al . , 2006 ) , and red - legged partridges ( Alectoris rufa ) ( Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2020 ) was also lowered in individuals in which testosterone was experimentally elevated . Return rates of testosterone - implanted greater prairie - chicken cocks ( Tympanunchus cupido ) males were also lower although not signi ﬁ cantly so ( Augustine et al . , 2011 ) . These studies suggest that testosterone elevation indeed has long - term survival costs . However , in several of these studies , elevations of testosterone were in the pharmacological range and / or were maintained after the breeding season in which the hormone is not elevated . So , to what extent elevated exposure to testosterone reduces survival or future reproduction under more natural conditions is not clear . In addition , effects on reproductive senescence and mechanistic links to carotenoid - dependent sexual signal expression were not directly investigated in these studies . Here , we test whether ( 11 - keto ) - testosterone ( the most biologically active androgen in most teleost ﬁ sh ) modulates the trade - off between current and future reproduction in three - spined stickleback . Reproductive behaviors and sexual coloration are absent in castrated stickleback , but can readily be restored by 11 - ketoandrostenedione , which is rapidly converted to 11 - ketotestosterone ( Borg and Mayer , 1995 ) . Male sticklebacks produce nests from algae and plant material , glued together with “ spiggin , ” produced in their kidneys in response to 11 - ketotestosterone ( Jakobsson et al . , 1996 ; Jakobsson et al . , 1999 ) . Using elaborate courtship , males attract gravid females to their nest to spawn and care for the offspring , and they repeat this nesting cycle multiple times in a single breeding season ( Wootton and Robert , 1984 ) . During their breeding season , stickleback exhibit a carotenoid - dependent trait , their reddish belly ( Wedekind et al . , 1998 ) , which is subject to female choice ( Künzler and Bakker , 2001 ; Pike et al . , 2007b ) and shows senescence ( a decrease in functioning attributed to aging ) within one breeding season ( Kim et al . , 2016 ) . Males with redder bellies were previously found to have longer lifespans , and carotenoid supplementation extends lifespan and the time reproductive effort can be maintained ( Pike et al . , 2007b ) . Stickleback populations can either inhabit fresh water throughout the year or migrate to sea and back to breed in spring ( anadromous populations ) . The subjects of this study are wild - caught individuals on migration from sea to their breeding grounds . This population has been reported to be annual ( van Mullem and van der Vlugt , 1964 ) ( including more contemporary information from the Dutch Water Board ) . Size distribution data from caught stickleback in ﬁ shways , estuaries ( including ﬁ sh included in this study ) , and at the freshwater breeding grounds at the start of the breeding season showed a single peak in the distribution . Notably returning ﬁ sh to sea also indicated a single peak of juvenile ﬁ sh on their return migration ( personal communication with and reports from the Dutch Water Board ) . Size density distributions are the most practical indication of the age distribution of populations of small ﬁ sh . All indications from the limited data ( from peer - reviewed sources and ecological reports ) available on this population are therefore that the ecology of this population is an anadromous population that has an annual breeding lifecycle in freshwater . Hence , reproductive activities during a single breeding season likely determine lifetime reproductive effort . We hypothesize that 11 - ketotestosterone elevation increases investment in current reproduction , e . g . , nest building and sexual coloration , at the cost of maintaining the soma and thereby future reproduction . METHODS Animals Anadromous three - spined stickleback were caught using a lift net at the locks of Noordpolderzijl , the Netherlands ( 53 ° 25 ′ 56 ″ N , 6 ° 34 ′ 59 ″ E ) . Small leaks of fresh water through the locks attract stickleback into the estuary when they start migration toward fresh water early spring . Fish were transported to the laboratory ( < 25 km away ) by car in aerated buckets ﬁ lled with water from the estuary . In our aquarium facility , fresh water was added to adjust the ﬁ sh to fresh water conditions across several days . Groups of ﬁ sh were housed together in large glass aquaria ( > 60 × 30 × 30 cm , L × H × W ) . Setup At the start of the experiment , individual males ( N (cid:2) 237 ) were housed in individual plastic tanks ( 27 . 5 × 17 . 5 × 17 cm , L × H × W , Ferplast geolarge ) , covered with a see - through plastic lid , containing a plastic plant ( in the front of the tank , Tetra Plantastics Ambulia Limnophila heterophylla , 11 – 15 cm ) and a pressure air ( provided via connected tubing by a Resun LP - 100 air - pump ) - operated ﬁ lter ( at the back of the tank , Europet Bernina ) .

Androgens and Costs of Reproduction white adhesive plastic that precluded any visual contact between the ﬁ sh . The tanks were set in eight vertically connected steel cabinets each containing six rows of shelves . Treatments were distributed across the cabinets balanced evenly for row and column and ﬁ sh started the experiment distributed across 5 days balanced for treatment to divide the time required for husbandry and measurements . The room was air - conditioned to keep water temperatures at 18 ° C . Lighting , LD 16 : 8 , corresponding to the daylength at the height of summer in the Netherlands , started when males were put in individual tanks , and was provided by ﬂ uorescent tubes ( OSRAM Cool White , L40W / 640SA ) placed on the ceiling in front of the cabinets . Fish were fed every morning with defrosted red bloodworms , ( Chironomus , 3F Frozen Fish Food ) in portions of ± 0 . 25 g using a plastic pipette . If after 15 min of the ﬁ rst portion an individual ﬁ sh had ﬁ nished all the provided food , it received another portion , to achieve near ad libitum feeding without detrimental effects of overfeeding on water quality . At the end of each day ( at least 1 h after the ﬁ rst feeding round ) , excess food was removed from each individual tank using a plastic syringe . To stimulate sexual behavior , gravid females in a plastic see - through jar were shown to individual males each day for 5 min . Each week , all water of each individual tank was changed , excluding the water retained in the small ﬁ lter compartment . Males were provided with 400 threads of green polyester threads ( 0 . 840 g of ± 6 - cm - long threads ) ( Barber , 2001 ; Rushbrook et al . , 2008 ) placed behind the arti ﬁ cial plant and a petri dish ( placed in the back of the aquarium ) ﬁ lled with white aquarium sand as nesting material . Each week , the ﬁ sh received new nesting material and had to rebuild their nest . Nests were examined each day , and if completed ( judged by the presence of a tunnel in the nest ) and if all material was used in the nest , a portion of extra green polyester threads ( 0 . 150 g ) was added to the aquarium behind the arti ﬁ cial plant . This protocol allowed us to calculate a metric of nesting intensity as a composite of nest material used and speed of nest completion . This metric was expressed as the amount of days nest material was added minus the days it took to complete the nest . The ability to build nests we used as a proxy of reproductive capacity given that without a nest a male stickleback cannot produce offspring , when sneaking of fertilizations that sometimes happen in speci ﬁ c populations is ignored . Our experimental protocol therefore did not assess paternal care at any point . We purposefully studied the consequences of androgens on the reproductive phase in which males display and attract females , as we were interested in trade - offs with carotenoid - dependent signaling . The photoperiod was changed to a short photoperiod ( LD 8 : 16 ) after 160 days , when less than 10 % of the individuals were showing nest building behavior . At that point , nest material provision and female stimulation ceased and individuals were subsequently only monitored for survival . Injections and Circulating 11 kt Concentrations After 1 week of acclimatization , individual males received two intraperitoneal injections ( using 0 . 3 - ml syringes , Becton Dickinson , Micro - Fine ) of molten cocoa butter ( 14 μ l / g ﬁ sh body mass ) . The cocoa butter was injected at a temperature of 37 ° C ( and solidi ﬁ ed quickly in the ﬁ sh kept in water of 18 ° C ) and was loaded with 11 - keto - androstenedione ( in suspension , 4 mg / ml , based on a pilot study described below ; Sigma Aldrich ) and / or with vitamin E ( dissolved , 226 mg / ml , α - tocopherol , Sigma Aldrich ) or with nothing . With these combinations , we created a balanced 2 × 2 design of 11 - keto - androstenedione and vitamin E . Our rationale for choosing vitamin E as a supplement was to study the suggested androgen - regulated relationship between carotenoid - dependent signaling and oxidative stress ( Peters , 2007 ) . To this end , we wanted to supplement an antioxidant , rather than pigmentary carotenoids with disputed antioxidant potential ( Simons et al . , 2012b ) , and vitamin E has previously been shown to increase the red belly of the stickleback ( Pike et al . , 2007a ) . In ﬁ sh , 11 - keto - androstenedione is rapidly converted to 11 - ketotestosterone and similar methods have been used in three - spined stickleback previously to elevate 11 - ketotestosterone concentrations ( Páll et al . , 2002 ; Kurtz et al . , 2007 ) , the main androgen in most male teleost ﬁ sh ( Borg et al . , 1993 ; Borg , 1994 ; Borg and Mayer , 1995 ) . Prior to the main experiment , but in the same spring , we carried out a pilot experiment to determine the appropriate dose of 11 - keto - androstenedione . We injected , as described above , concentrations of 1 , 4 , and 8 mg / ml 11 - keto - androstenedione and subsequently obtained plasma 5 days later . 11 - Ketotestosterone levels in plasma were determined by radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) and were found to be elevated strongly with the 4 mg / ml dose , without any apparent further increase at the highest dose [ 0 vs . 4 , χ ( 1 ) 2 (cid:2) 7 . 4 , p (cid:2) 0 . 007 ; 4 vs . 8 , χ ( 1 ) 2 (cid:2) 0 . 62 , p (cid:2) 0 . 43 ; Figure 1 ] . FIGURE1 | Resultsofthepilotexperimenttodetermineresultingplasma concentrations of 11 - ketotestosterone after treatment with different dosages of 11 - keto - androstenedione . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org December 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 752352 4 Simons et al . Androgens and Costs of Reproduction At 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 weeks after the injections , random subsets of individuals of the main experiment were sacri ﬁ ced for blood collection balanced for treatment . The ﬁ sh were killed by a blow to the head , the tail was cut just posterior of the anus , and blood was collected from the caudal vein using heparinized glass capillaries . Blood was kept on ice until plasma was obtained via centrifugation ( 850 RCF for 7 min ) . Hematocrit of the individual samples was measured from the centrifuged capillaries with a digital caliper ( Mitutoyo , to the nearest 10 μ m ) . Plasma was stored in − 80 ° C prior to analyses . Individual ﬁ sh were weighed prior to blood taking and , after blood taking , the mass of the testes , liver , kidney , and spleen were determined . 11 - Keto testosterone levels were determined via radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) as previously described ( Sebire et al . , 2007 ) . After thawing , the plasma samples were centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 3 min at 4 ° C and then 5 μ l was transferred into a 1 . 5 - ml Eppendorf tube . Distilled water ( 100 μ l ) and ethyl acetate ( 1 ml ) were added to the tube and vortexed for a few seconds . The samples were again centrifuged ( 13 , 000 rpm for 3 min at 4 ° C ) and the bottom of the tube was subsequently placed brie ﬂ y into liquid nitrogen . The organic phase was separated from the frozen aqueous phase into a glass tube . This extraction was repeated a second time . The ethyl acetate extracts were dried under a nitrogen stream at 45 ° C and redissolved in 500 μ l of RIA buffer prior to analysis by RIA . Within the actual experiment , 11 - keto - androstenedione treatment increased 11 - ketotestosterone levels but relatively mildly [ F ( 1 , 64 ) (cid:2) 5 . 97 , p (cid:2) 0 . 017 ; Figure 3 ] . Note that these samples were taken later in the season ( relative to the time of injection ) than in the pilot study ( Figure 1 ) , which may explain the lower elevation measured . However , we did not detect an effect of time at which plasma was collected in this dataset [ F ( 1 , 61 ) (cid:2) 0 . 18 , p (cid:2) 0 . 91 ] which suggests that the mild elevation in 11 - ketotestosterone our treatment induced was maintained for at least 5 weeks , yet levels prior to 2 weeks were probably higher , judging from the elevation measured in the pilot study . Furthermore , we only detected a signi ﬁ cant effect of our treatment if we took natural variation of testis size into account , which covaried positively with 11 - ketotestosterone plasma levels [ F ( 1 , 64 ) (cid:2) 9 . 20 , p (cid:2) 0 . 004 ; Figure 2 ] . Compared to the population variance in 11 - ketotestosterone , independent of variance attributable to testis size , our experimental treatment with 11 - keto - androstenedione resulted in an elevation of 0 . 63 standard deviation of 11 - ketotestosterone . So , the 11 - ketotestosterone level of a given ﬁ sh in the 11 - keto - androstenedione - treated group was elevated beyond its own endogenous production as determined by its testis size . This rationale is in line with the lack of feedback of circulating 11 - ketotestosterone concentrations on its production in this species , implicating that experimental elevation of the hormone does not impact on its endogenous production . For example , removal of one testis halves 11 - ketotestosterone levels ( Hellqvist et al . , 2002 ) . No effects of vitamin E treatment on 11 - ketotestosterone levels were detected ( p > 0 . 77 ) . Variation in 11 - ketotestosterone did not correlate with maximum or average blue or red breeding coloration prior to sacri ﬁ cing ( p > 0 . 64 and p > 0 . 10 , respectively ) . Breeding Coloration Weekly measurements of coloration were made using digital photography ( Sony α - 200 ) with ﬁ xed camera setting and in a controlled lighting environment . Fish were placed in a small glass container with a piece of foam at the back to restrain the ﬁ sh to the front of the glass with its body side . The glass was ﬁ tted within a holder to allow it to be placed in a fully darkened box slightly tilted to avoid re ﬂ ections in the glass . The camera was attached to this setup and a lightproof fabric was wrapped around the camera to avoid any outside light entering the box . A white - LED ring light ( Sony HVL - RLAM ) was placed on the lens of the camera and lit the box . As digital cameras do not respond linearly to light , and hence are biased in measuring properties of light re ﬂ ectance ( e . g . , color ) ( Stevens et al . , 2007 ; Pike , 2011 ) , we calibrated ( Stigell et al . , 2007 ) our camera with a large set of color patches ( Munsell Glossy Edition , with known re ﬂ ectance from the Joensuu Spectral Database ) under the same lighting and ﬁ xed camera settings . Such an approach allows for an accurate representation of re ﬂ ectance spectra from RGB values extracted from digital pictures ( Stigell et al . , 2007 ; Simons et al . , 2012c ; Simons et al . , 2016 ) . Fish were extracted from the pictures automatically using thresholding , cluster analysis , and alpha shapes in Matlab . The reddest and bluish part ( consisting largely of blue iris coloration ) of the individual ﬁ sh were selected using image segmentation via thresholding of chroma from the simulated spectra per pixel ( Figure 3 ) . If all pixels fell below this threshold , this data point was excluded from the analysis , which happened in 8 % of the cases within the analyses of blue coloration and in 0 % of the cases where we analyzed red pigmentation . From these selected FIGURE 2 | 11 - ketotestosterone plasma concentrations in the main experiment regressed against residual testis mass ( againstbodymass ) .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org December 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 752352 5 Simons et al . Androgens and Costs of Reproduction patches , we calculated an average simulated spectra to estimate the chroma of the blue ( summed re ﬂ ectance between 420 and 540 nm divided by total re ﬂ ectance between 420 and 740 nm ) and red ( summed re ﬂ ectance between 620 and 740 nm divided by total re ﬂ ectance between 420 and 740 nm ) breeding coloration for each individual ﬁ sh . The red and blue coloration , with the latter relatively understudied , of three - spined stickleback determine sexual attractiveness and are associated with aspects of quality ( Milinski and Bakker , 1990 ; Künzler and Bakker , 2001 ; Rush et al . , 2003 ; Pike et al . , 2007b ; Flamarique et al . , 2013 ) . Statistical Analyses All individual measures on the ﬁ sh were analyzed with general linear models or mixed models . If multiple measures from a ﬁ sh were included , a random intercept for each ﬁ sh was included in the model to correct for pseudo - replication . Note , the time variable ( “ week ” ) in the experiment was included as a categorical variable in the mixed models , as ignoring or misestimating random slopes in mixed models leads to a large in ﬂ ation of type I error ( Schielzeth and Forstmeier , 2009 ) . Interpretation of patterns over time were based on least square means and their associated standard errors as provided in the ﬁ gures . Model selection was based on backward selection of a model containing the interactions of the two treatment variables with the week of the experiment and mass at the start of the experiment . Breeding coloration was solely analyzed in ﬁ sh that were still breeding ( buildings nests ) , because breeding coloration fades quickly after the termination of reproductive activities . Reproductive senescence , as measured by the period that reproductive activities ( i . e . , nest building ) were maintained , was analyzed using time to event Cox proportional hazard models ( “ coxph ” ) ( Therneau and Grambsch , 2000 ) . These models used right - hand censoring for the sacri ﬁ ced animals , those that died an accidental death , or those that were still building nests when the experiment was terminated ( 21 weeks after the injections ) . All analyses were performed in SAS JMP 7 . 0 and R . Sample sizes differ between the analyses that span across the breeding season , due to a decline in the number of eligible ﬁ sh ( i . e . , surviving and in breeding state ) . Hence , degrees of freedom of each analysis provide information on the underlying sample size . No violations of the assumption of a Gaussian distribution were detected in the dependent variables and residuals of the parametric models . RESULTS Reproductive and Mortality Senescence 11 - Keto - androstenedione treatment accelerated reproductive senescence . The period that individuals maintained their breeding activities ( week of last complete nest minus week of ﬁ rst complete nest ) was shorter after androgen treatment ( logHR (cid:2) 0 . 35 ± 0 . 16 , p (cid:2) 0 . 034 , Figure 4 ) , whereas the interaction with the main effect of vitamin E treatment was not signi ﬁ cant ( p > 0 . 22 ) and therefore removed from the model . This effect did not arise from 11 - keto - androstenedione - treated animals starting with nest building sooner ( rank test , W (cid:2) 6 , 985 . 5 , p (cid:2) 0 . 45 ) . A small part of this effect can be attributed to lower survival in the 11 - keto - androstenedione treated ﬁ sh . When analyzed across all data available for this study , there is a small decrease in survival that is far from signi ﬁ cant ( logHR (cid:2) 0 . 05 ± 0 . 17 , p (cid:2) 0 . 75 ; FIGURE3 | Exampleoftheautomaticselectionandthresholdingusedto obtain red and blue chroma of the nuptial coloration of the stickleback .

Yet , when we analyzed data of the breeding season only , or up to the point of which we are sure 11 - ketotestosterone is elevated ( the last point at which animals were sacri ﬁ ced for this purpose ) the reduced survival in the 11 - keto - androstenedione group these effects were stronger , but remained non - signi ﬁ cant ( logHR (cid:2) 0 . 24 ± 0 . 25 , p (cid:2) 0 . 33 , logHR (cid:2) 0 . 53 ± 0 . 38 , p (cid:2) 0 . 16 , respectively ) . No effects of vitamin E were detected in any of these models ( p > 0 . 24 ) . Body Composition Individual mass at sacri ﬁ cing covaried positively with all four organ masses ( p < 0 . 0002 ) and was therefore included in the models testing for treatment effects . 11 - Keto - androstenedione treatment and vitamin E treatment did not interact for any of the organ masses ( p > 0 . 14 ) and the week at which the individual was killed did not contribute signi ﬁ cantly either ( p > 0 . 08 ) . Therefore , we tested the effect of 11 - keto - androstenedione and vitamin E treatment separately on the masses of the testes , liver , kidney , and spleen , and also on mass at sacri ﬁ cing with mass at the start of treatment included as covariate ( Table 1 ) . No effects of 11 - keto - androstenedione treatment were detected . Vitamin E treatment reduced mass - speci ﬁ c liver and spleen mass , and also mass change from mass at sacri ﬁ cing ( Table 1 ) . Note that most of these effects are likely driven by mass loss compared to mass at injection ( mass at injection was balanced but slightly higher in vitamin E treated ﬁ sh , estimate : 0 . 013 ± 0 . 11 , p (cid:2) 0 . 23 ) . When mass at sacri ﬁ cing was removed from the models , all associations with vitamin E and organ masses were reduced to non - signi ﬁ cant trends , p > 0 . 07 . Coloration Red coloration increased during the ﬁ rst part of the breeding season and declined at the end [ week : F ( 21 , 1663 ) (cid:2) 14 . 8 , p < FIGURE 5 | Survival ( in days after the start of the experiment ) plotted across the whole follow - up period , separated for 11 - keto - androstenedione - treated individuals ( dashed ) and controls ( solid ) .

This increase was lower in the androgen - treated ﬁ sh , resulting in lower red coloration during the middle of the breeding season , but this effect did not reach statistical signi ﬁ cance [ 11 kA × week : F ( 21 , 1663 ) (cid:2) 1 . 46 , p (cid:2) 0 . 08 ; Figure 6 ] . In the models , we also included mass at the start of the experiment , which covaried positively with the intensity of the red breeding coloration [ estimate : 0 . 010 ± 0 . 003 , F ( 1 , 220 . 2 ) (cid:2) 10 . 90 , p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ] . In these models , we did not detect any effects or interactions with vitamin E treatment ( p > 0 . 70 ) . Blue coloration decreased during the breeding season [ F ( 21 , 1536 ) (cid:2) 13 . 8 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Figure 6 ] but no effects or interactions with either 11 - keto - androstenedione or vitamin E treatment were detected ( p > 0 . 72 ) and no relationship with mass was detected [ estimate : 0 . 0017 ± 0 . 001 , F ( 1 , 220 . 8 ) (cid:2) 2 . 64 , p (cid:2) 0 . 11 ] . Nest Building Behavior Nesting intensity , the amount of times extra material was added minus the time needed to complete a nest , increased at the start of the breeding season and gradually declined towards the end of the season [ week : F ( 21 , 1609 ) (cid:2) 6 . 18 , p < 0 . 0001 , Figure 7 ] . 11 - Keto - androstenedione - treated individuals showed reduced nesting intensity at the beginning and end of the breeding season [ week × 11 kA : F ( 21 , 1609 ) (cid:2) 1 . 60 , p (cid:2) 0 . 042 ; Figure 7 ] . No interactions with vitamin E treatment were detected ( p > 0 . 47 ) and mass was positively related to nesting intensity [ estimate (cid:2) 0 . 94 ± 0 . 25 , F ( 1 , 203 . 8 ) (cid:2) 13 . 6 , p (cid:2) 0 . 0003 ] . Relationships Between the Intensity of Breeding Coloration With Reproductive Senescence and Lifespan Average and maximum chroma ( which correlated strongly , r (cid:2) 0 . 94 , N (cid:2) 155 , p < 0 . 0001 ) achieved during the breeding season correlated positively with the time individuals could maintain their nesting activity ( average : r (cid:2) 0 . 17 , p (cid:2) 0 . 036 ; maximum r (cid:2) 0 . 29 , p (cid:2) 0 . 0002 , N (cid:2) 155 ; Figure 8 ) . For maximum blue coloration , we also detected a trend of a positive relationship ( r (cid:2) 0 . 15 , p (cid:2) 0 . 06 , N (cid:2) 155 , but not for average r (cid:2) − 0 . 12 , p (cid:2) 0 . 12 , N (cid:2) 155 ) . Note that from these analyses , we excluded individuals that were sacri ﬁ ced for the 11 - ketotestosterone analyses , because these animals are censored with respect to the averaged and maximum chroma they could have achieved . Because quadratic relationships with sexual signal expression and longevity have been reported previously , we also tested for quadratic effects and detected a quadratic effect in the relationship between maximum red chroma and breeding period [ F ( 1 , 152 ) (cid:2) 7 . 73 , p (cid:2) 0 . 006 ; Figure 8 , quadratic relationships with max blue chroma were not signi ﬁ cant p > 0 . 9 ] . Note that this quadratic relationship with breeding period ( and also lifespan below ) and maximum chroma cannot be attributable to regression to the mean . The maximum is predicted to increase with the number of sampling points , related to breeding period ( and lifespan ) in our setup , and in this respect , the linear slope of maximum chroma may be biased upward , rather than downward . Lifespan was also positively related to average [ logHR : − 3 . 29 ± 4 . 06 , χ ( 1 ) 2 (cid:2) 0 . 67 , p (cid:2) 0 . 42 ] and maximum red chroma [ logHR : − 9 . 20 ± 4 . 00 , χ ( 1 ) 2 (cid:2) 5 . 50 , p (cid:2) 0 . 022 ] . For maximum red chroma , we also detected a quadratic relationship ( logHR estimates : linear : − 290 ± 90 . 7 , p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ; quadratic 279 ± 89 . 8 , p < 0 . 002 ) . Higher maximum blue chroma tended to be associated with lower survival ( logHR : 16 . 64 ± 10 . 90 , p (cid:2) 0 . 13 ) . When maximum blue chroma was added to the quadratic maximum red chroma model , both the linear term and the quadratic term of FIGURE 7 | Nesting intensity [ amount of days extra material was added minus the time needed to complete a nest ( days ) ] ﬁ rst increased during the breeding season and then declined . 11 - Keto - androstenedione ( open dots ) - treated individuals showed in general reduced nesting intensity during the start of the breeding season . FIGURE 8 | Higher maximum red chroma achieved during the breeding season signaled higher reproductive capacity . However , the signi ﬁ cance of the quadratic term suggests that in the reddest individuals , this relationship levels off or may even become negative . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org December 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 752352 8 Simons et al . Androgens and Costs of Reproduction red chroma remained signi ﬁ cant ( p < 0 . 008 ) , and maximum blue chroma was signi ﬁ cantly positively related to mortality hazard ( logHR : 27 . 7 ± 12 . 3 , p (cid:2) 0 . 024 ) . Note that maximum red chroma and maximum blue chroma only loosely correlate ( r (cid:2) 0 . 35 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Rush et al . , 2003 ) ; multicollinearity biasing the model estimates is therefore unlikely . DISCUSSION Current and Future Reproduction 11 - Ketotestosterone elevation decreased our proxy for future reproductive success , the length that reproductive activities are maintained . This suggests that androgens are involved in the regulation of the trade - off between current and future reproduction . However , we do not ﬁ nd any evidence for positive effects on our proxies for current reproduction after 11 - ketotestosterone elevation . On the contrary , if anything , red breeding coloration and nesting vigor are lowered in the 11 - ketotestosterone elevated animals . Negative consequences of our treatment because of high pharmacological dosing are unlikely because our treatment resulted in only a mild increase in 11 - ketotestosterone . Therefore , investment induced by 11 - ketotestosterone in other aspects of physiology that we did not measure may have generated the costs that resulted in the reduction in future reproductive success we observed . These costs could be related to various aspects of reproduction such as sperm production , spiggin production , and sexual behavior . It is probably unlikely that these costs involve direct increased metabolic demand , because mass and body composition were left unaffected by 11 - ketotestosterone elevation . Alternatively , there might be direct costs of higher levels of 11 - ketotestosterone imposed by unknown physiological constraints , thereby reducing future reproduction . Androgens , Vitamin E , and Carotenoid - Dependent Coloration The hypothesized involvement of androgens in the trade - offs concerning carotenoid - dependent coloration ( Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2007 ; Peters , 2007 ) is not supported by our ﬁ ndings . Elevation of 11 - ketotestosterone did not increase red breeding coloration , but rather decreased it . In addition , variation in 11 - ketotestosterone levels was not related to breeding coloration , in line with an earlier smaller study ( Wright et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , another study on stickleback red breeding coloration and 11 - ketotestosterone ( Kurtz et al . , 2007 ) found that if individuals had spent 4 ( higher 11 - ketotestosterone level ) compared to 6 weeks ( lower 11 - ketotestosterone levels ) in breeding conditions prior to measurement of circulating 11 - ketotestosterone levels , a correlation with breeding coloration was not apparent . Our results and previous ones might thus suggest that variation in 11 - ketotestosterone levels in full breeding condition does not determine investment in breeding coloration but may still regulate a suite of other behaviors or aspects of physiology related to current reproduction . Our results also do not support the mechanistic explanation for the hypothesized trade - off between oxidative stress and carotenoid allocation to sexual coloration . Vitamin E treatment did not increase coloration . This is contrary to an earlier report in stickleback showing that breeding coloration increased under a diet of a combination of vitamin C and E ( Pike et al . , 2007a ) . Similarly , the reduction in time that 11 - keto - androstenedione - treated ﬁ sh could maintain their reproductive activities is unlikely to be attributable to oxidative stress costs , because we detected no interactions with the vitamin E treatment . These conclusions all assume that our methodology of injecting vitamin E resulted in elevated levels of vitamin E in our ﬁ sh . No pellets were lost by ﬁ sh and were observed in all ﬁ sh that were sacri ﬁ ced and died a natural death . We must assume that vitamin E was therefore available to the ﬁ sh for uptake . However , we prioritized analyzing the plasma samples for 11 - ketotestosterone analyses as they were too small to also measure vitamin E . Treatment with vitamin E led to slightly lower body and organ mass , which could indicate a loss rather than a gain in body condition . Our conclusions are therefore dependent on the only partially supported assumption that vitamin E injection led to increased bioavailable vitamin E . Senescence of Nuptial Coloration and Associations With Survival Variation in red breeding coloration was positively related to longevity and the time nesting activities could be maintained . This is in concordance with an earlier study on sticklebacks of a smaller sample size ( N (cid:2) 32 ) that investigated the relationship between redness and longevity ( Pike et al . , 2007b ) . Sexual ornament expression is in general found to be positively related to survival ( Jennions et al . , 2001 ) , yet examples for carotenoid - dependent coloration are relatively scarce and dominated by studies on birds ( Hill , 1991 ; Hõrak et al . , 2001 ; Figuerola and Carlos Senar , 2007 ; Simons et al . , 2012d ; Simons et al . , 2016 ; Cantarero et al . , 2019 ) . Interestingly , we detected a quadratic relationship of redness with survival and the length that breeding can be maintained , suggesting that , at a certain point , carotenoid - dependent breeding coloration does not signal quality but may be related to reduced survival and breeding capacity . It is possible that this is a common pattern for carotenoid - dependent signals or even sexual signals in general . Serins ( Serinus serinus ) with intermediate carotenoid - derived brightness have higher survival ( Figuerola and Carlos Senar , 2007 ) , and in the zebra ﬁ nch ( Taeniopygia guttata ) , we detected a similar quadratic relationship of their carotenoid - based bill coloration and longevity , when controlling for terminal declines ( Simons et al . , 2012d ; Simons et al . , 2016 ) . Together , these ﬁ ndings indicate that the reddest mates potentially overinvest in their ornament to attract females . Choice for these males ( Milinski and Bakker , 1990 ; Künzler and Bakker , 2001 ; Pike et al . , 2007b ) might still provide the direct bene ﬁ ts of producing sexy sons , or high signaling males might signal different aspects of quality , perhaps related more to current rather than future reproduction . For example , redness of the stickleback belly is related to functional fertility ( Pike et al . , 2010 ) and unexpectedly higher somatic and germline damage was detected in males with the most red signals ( Kim and Velando , 2020 ) . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org December 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 752352 9 Simons et al . Androgens and Costs of Reproduction Compared to the carotenoid - based red belly of the stickleback , their iridescent blue iris has been studied less , but has been suggested to be a decisive feature during female mate choice ( Rush et al . , 2003 ; Flamarique et al . , 2013 ) . Males may maintain a red belly for the purpose of enhancing blue iris contrast ( Rush et al . , 2003 ; Flamarique et al . , 2013 ) . Surprisingly we ﬁ nd that chroma of the blue iris reduces over the breeding season and that red breeding coloration is not at its maximum when the blue iris is . There is thus a mismatch between these two signals that does not result in the highest possible contrast , which would be perceived as most attractive to females . Moreover , the maximum intensity of the blue iris was negatively related to survival , which can suggest that there are costs to maintain iris color . The iridescent blue iris of the stickleback is formed by endogenously produced pigments ( Frischknecht , 1993 ) . The associated costs or detailed information on its physiology is currently lacking and warrant future study . CONCLUSION 11 - Ketotestosterone elevation reduced future reproductive success . Although we did not detect bene ﬁ ts to current reproduction , it is plausible that 11 - ketotestosterone regulates aspects of the trade - off between current and future reproduction . It remains to be determined what these aspects are . We did not detect any evidence for the proposed regulatory role of androgens in the carotenoid trade - off between somatic maintenance and sexual signaling . We did ﬁ nd , however , that carotenoid - dependent coloration signals reproductive capacity and longevity . In the reddest individuals , however , this relationship is diminished and even turns negative . These quadratic relationships between sexual signal expression and aspects of quality ( Candolin , 1999 ; Simons et al . , 2016 ) , not unique to the stickleback , have important consequences for how we view sexual selection on ornamentation in general .
