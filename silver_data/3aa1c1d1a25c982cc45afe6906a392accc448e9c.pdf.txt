Unexpectedly , the small GTPase Rho , a crucial regulator of cell movement , has been reported to be active in both local cell protrusions and retractions , raising the question of how Rho activity can coordinate cell migration . Here we show that Rho activity is absent in local protrusions and active during retractions . During retractions , Rho rapidly activated ezrin - radixin - moesin proteins ( ERMs ) to increase actin - membrane attachment , and , with a delay , non - muscle myosin II ( NMII ) . Rho activity was excitable , with NMII acting as a slow negative feedback regulator . Strik - ingly , inhibition of SLK / LOK kinases , through which Rho activates ERMs , caused elongated cell morphologies , impaired Rho - induced cell contractions , and reverted Rho - induced blebbing . Together , our study demonstrates that Rho activity drives re - tractions by sequentially enhancing ERM - mediated actin - membrane attachment for force transmission and NMII - dependent contractility . Introduction In response to external stimuli , cells can polarize for directed mi - gration , forming distinct cytoskeletal structures specific to the cell front and back . In the absence of directional cues , many adherent cell types lose their front - back polarization , but remain motile and undergo cycles of random protrusion and retraction , often occur - ring in a wave - like manner 1 – 4 . This intrinsic cellular behavior oc - curs on the timescale of minutes and is also widely observed in migrating cells , both in 2D and in 3D environments 5 – 9 . The small GTPases of the Rho family ( RhoGTPases ) , in particular the Rac , Cdc42 , and Rho subfamilies ( referred to as Rac , Cdc42 , and Rho hereafter ) , regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics in motile cells by driving protrusive and contractile cell shape changes . Across many cell types and contexts , Rac and Cdc42 have well - defined roles in cellular protrusions , where they promote actin polymeri - zation - driven cell edge extensions 10 – 15 . Although widely accepted as the master regulator of cellular contractility through its effec - tors Rho associated kinase ( ROCK ) and non - muscle myosin II ( NMII ) 16 , 17 , Rho’s role in regulating cell motility remains incom - pletely understood . Elevated Rho activity has been observed in cell retractions 18 – 22 , but also near the cell edge in protrusions and ruffles , where it showed high correlations with local outward cell edge movements 14 , 23 – 27 . A plausible effector downstream of Rho that drives protrusions is the formin mDia1 14 , 28 . However , exogenous activation of Rho generally causes cells to contract and subcellular activation of Rho using optogenetics has not yet been observed to induce protrusions 29 – 33 . In addition to the established Rho - activated targets ROCK and mDia1 , Rho can activate the ezrin - radixin - moesin family proteins ( ERMs ) , through the ki - nases SLK ( Ste20 - like kinase ) and LOK ( lymphocyte - oriented ki - nase ) , which have recently emerged as Rho effectors 34 – 37 . SLK / LOK activate ERMs 35 , 38 , which , when activated , link actin to the plasma membrane , to form the actin cortex and therefore control shape and mechanical properties of cells 39 . The actin cor - tex is involved in cell motility in multiple ways . A contractile cor - tex can drive cell rear retraction or generate pressure during amoe - boid cell migration 40 , 41 . In protrusions , the actin cortex forms a barrier that has to locally weaken or detach from the plasma mem - brane before protrusions can be initiated 42 , 43 . We set out to determine whether Rho activity drives pro - trusions or retractions and to test for a possible involvement of ERM activation downstream of Rho . We visualized Rho activity along with the Rho effectors NMII or ERMs using fluorescence - based reporters in single unpolarized endothelial cells that exhibit random cycles of minute and µm - scale protrusions and retrac - tions . We found Rho was enriched in retractions , but not in pro - trusions , and identified that edge - proximal Rho dynamics were pulsatile , displaying hallmark characteristics of excitability .

Activated ERMs coincided with Rho in retractions , whereas NMII accumu - lated with a delay . The inhibition of SLK / LOK kinases resulted in elongated cell phenotypes and impaired Rho - induced cell con - tractility , demonstrating that both ERMs and NMII are required for contractile cell shape changes downstream of Rho . Results Sparsely plated HT - HUVEC exhibit , random , minute - scale protrusion - retraction cycles In the absence of directional cues , HT - HUVEC ( hTERT immor - talized human umbilical vein endothelial cells 31 ) exhibit random motile behavior when plated on uniform substrates at low density . Such random motility is characterized by cycles of protrusions and retractions that occur on a timescale of minutes ( Fig . 1a , Video 1 ) . We found that such behavior was particularly suitable for quantitative analysis when observed within a few hours after cell plating , when cells had completed spreading and assumed rel - atively homogenous and compact adhesion surfaces while show - ing active protrusion / retraction behavior . We quantified cell shape changes based on time - lapse sequences of cells stably ex - pressing fluorescence - based reporters , automated cell segmenta - tion , followed by edge velocity tracking , using established meth - ods 14 , 19 . For cell edge velocity tracking , segmented cell outlines were divided into 180 equally spaced peripheral coordinate win - dows spanning the entire cell perimeter . Each window had an ad - justable depth towards the cell interior in which fluorescence - based reporter activity could be measured ( Fig . 1b ) . Window ve - locities were calculated using per frame displacements , resulting in 2D spatiotemporal edge velocity maps ( Fig . 1b , c ) . From such maps , we identified protrusions and retractions as events exceed - ing defined minima of outward and inward velocity and spatio - temporal scale ( Fig . 1c , Materials and Methods ) . This analysis re - vealed that over a 1h duration , randomly sampled cells ( n = 55 ) had on average 27 . 63 ± 10 . 27 ( mean±SD ) individual protrusion events , each with an average mean velocity of 6 . 39 ± 0 . 61µm / min , lasting for 4 . 21 ( ± 0 . 75 ) min , and spanning 8 . 26 % ( ± 1 . 32 % ) of the cell perimeter . In comparison , the same cells had 20 . 79 ± 12 . 17 retraction events with a mean velocity of - 5 . 93 ± 0 . 63µm / min , lasting for 5 . 03 ( ± 1 . 10 ) min and spanning 6 . 69 % ( ± 1 . 10 % ) of the cell perimeter ( Fig . 1d ) . Spatiotemporal analysis of Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 using FRET - based activity probes in randomly motile HT - HUVEC To enable spatiotemporal analysis of Rac , Cdc42 , and Rho activ - ities in thresholded protrusions and retractions , we first tested the suitability of existing FRET - based activity probes in HT - HU - VEC . For Rho , we tested RhoA - based RhoA2G 44 , DORA - RhoA 25 , and a RhoB - based RhoB sensor 20 . The probes were sta - bly expressed in HT - HUVEC via lentiviral transduction and their responses to acute , pathway - selective perturbations were assessed ( Materials and Methods ) . Activation of Rho using thrombin re - sulted in increased Rho activity as reported by all three probes , with the RhoB sensor showing by far the strongest response ( Fig . 1e , f ) . RhoA and RhoB share > 85 % sequence identity , and func - tionally many GEFs , GAPs , and downstream effectors 34 , 45 . RhoA and RhoB differ in their C - terminal domains , resulting in distinct lipid modifications and localization patterns , with RhoA and RhoB being mainly cytoplasmic and membrane - localized , respec - tively 46 , 47 . Consistent with this , the RhoA - based probes RhoA2G and DORA - RhoA primarily localized to the cytoplasm , whereas the RhoB sensor was mainly plasma membrane - localized ( Sup - plementary Fig . 1a ) . We found that local Rho activities reported by RhoA2G and DORA - RhoA appeared to be affected by the lo - cal cell geometry , when viewed by epifluorescence microscopy . The highest activities were generally enriched in the cell periph - ery and lowest activities in the cell center , corresponding to high and low membrane / cytoplasm ratios , respectively ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 1a ( i , ii ) ) . To assess a possible localization bias of re - ported Rho activities , we performed pixel - by - pixel correlations between normalized Rho activities and their localizations for each of the three probes . RhoA2G and DORA - RhoA both yielded sig - nificantly stronger anticorrelations compared to the RhoB sensor ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ( iii ) , b ) , indicating that the activities re - ported by RhoA - based probes were affected by local cell geome - try . Thus , ratiometric FRET analysis based on epifluorescence imaging data insufficiently corrects for cell geometry when most of the inactive probe resides in the cytoplasm , as in the case of RhoA - based probes . To further explore the suitability of the RhoB sensor for spatiotemporal analysis of Rho activity , we tested its response to plasma membrane translocation of mCherry - FKBP - ARHGEF1 ( GEF ) and mCherry - FKBP - ARHGAP29 ( GAP ) , through rapamycin - induced heterodimerization with plasma membrane - localized Lyn 11 - FRB , to acutely ( in ) activate Rho ac - tivity in cells ( Fig . 1g , h , i ) . ARHGEF1 and ARHGAP29 are a Rho - specific GEF and GAP , respectively , and the RhoB sensor showed bidirectional , expected responses to plasma membrane translocation of their catalytic domains . Thus , due to the superior response to thrombin , the absence of a noticeable localization bias , and the robust responses to both activating and inactivating Rho - regulators , we considered the RhoB sensor as the preferred Rho probe for spatiotemporal analysis in HT - HUVEC and our im - aging systems for subsequent analysis . As Rac and Cdc42 reporters , we chose RaichuEV - Rac and RaichuEV - Cdc42 19 , 42 , 48 , 49 . They reported expected responses to pathway - stimulating signals . Increased activities occurred upon plasma membrane translocation of mCherry - FKBP - TIAM ( GEF ) ( Fig . 1j ) and mCherry - FKBP - ITSN1 ( GEF ) ( Fig . 1k ) with TIAM being a Rac - specific and ITSN1 a Cdc42 - specific RhoGEF . We noted that RaichuEV - Rac and RaichuEV - Cdc42 co - activated in response to the GEF translocations , consistent with positive feedback mechanisms that engage during cell pro - trusions 50 . RaichuEV - Rac and RaichuEV - Cdc42 were inactivated and activated upon Rho activation and inactivation , respectively ( Fig . 1f , i ) ( with the exception for ARHGEF1 - activated Rho , Fig . 1h ) , consistent with an antagonism between protrusive and con - tractile RhoGTPase activities 51 . In addition to expected bidirec - tional responses of all RhoGTPase probes tested , their temporal responses were on the order of seconds , further validating their suitability for spatiotemporal analysis in motile cells . We then imaged randomly motile HT - HUVEC stably expressing RaichuEV - Rac , RaichuEV - Cdc42 , RhoB sensor , DORA - RhoA , or RhoA2G or at 25s intervals to identify spatio - temporal activation patterns of Rho GTPases during protrusion - retraction cycles ( Fig . 2 , Videos 2 - 6 ) .

Panels ( iii ) show cross correlations be - tween edge velocity and RhoGTPase activities compiled from multiple cells . As expected , relative to membrane segments clas - sified as non - moving , Rac1 and Cdc42 were elevated in protru - sions and reduced in local retractions ( Fig . 2a , b ( i ) ) . Cross - corre - lation analysis between edge velocity and Rac1 ( Fig . 2a ( iii ) ) or Cdc42 ( Fig . 2b ( iii ) ) showed strong positive correlations with lags of negative 25 - 50s ( i . e . peak RhoGTPase activities lagging peak edge velocities ) , confirming previous results 14 , 15 . Interestingly , the RhoB sensor showed an opposite pattern of activity - uni - formly inactive in protrusions , and variably but consistently acti - vated in retractions ( Fig . 2c ( i ) ) . Cross - correlation between edge velocity and RhoB sensor activity yielded a sharply negative peak lagging edge velocity by 25 - 50s ( Fig . 2c ( iii ) ) . Similar analyses using DORA - RhoA or RhoA2G confirmed enrichment of Rho ac - tivity in retractions ( Fig . 2d , e ( i ) ) . Cross - correlations between edge velocity and RhoA2G or DORA - RhoA signals were less uni - form between cells , but similarly consistently negative ( Fig . 2d , e ( iii ) ) , confirming that edge - proximal Rho activity is correlated with local edge retractions and anticorrelated with protrusions . Together , our analyses demonstrate that µm and minute - scale cell shape changes in randomly motile HT - HUVEC are associated with distinct RhoGTPase activity patterns , with elevated Rac and Cdc42 activities protrusions and elevated Rho activity in retrac - tions . Pulsatile activation of Rho during membrane retractions We subsequently focused on Rho activity in membrane retrac - tions , since Rac and Cdc42 have well - documented roles in driving membrane protrusions . Visually , RhoB sensor activity propagated from the cell interior towards the cell edge before retraction onset ( Fig . 3a , b , Video 7 ) . Our cross - correlation analyses between edge velocities and Rho activity yielded a negative correlation and time - lag , however , these parameters result from averaged rela - tionships in protrusions and retractions combined . To specifically determine the kinetics of Rho activation relative to membrane re - tractions ( but not Rho inactivation in protrusions ) , we analyzed RhoB sensor activity in parts of spatiotemporal edge velocity maps where protrusions transitioned into retractions . ( Supple - mentary Fig . 2 , Materials and Methods ) . To compare RhoB sensor activation across multiple retraction events , we aligned Rho ki - netics and edge velocity time courses by setting time = 0 to the transition point from protrusion to retraction ( edge velocity = 0 ) . The resulting averaged Rho activity time - course showed a strik - ing , pulse - like activation during retractions ( Fig . 3c ) . RhoB sen - sor activity began to rise well before retraction onset , while edge velocity remained positive . Upon reaching the transition point , RhoB sensor levels were already well above basal activation lev - els and increased in a non - linear fashion . Surprisingly , RhoB sen - sor activity did not remain statically elevated throughout the re - traction . Peak RhoB sensor activity 2 min after retraction onset was followed by a marked reduction and return to baseline levels , indicating the presence of an inactivation mechanism triggered before retraction completion . Such pulse - like patterns of activity are generated by activator - in - hibitor coupled excitable systems , comprised of fast auto - activa - tion paired with delayed self - inhibition 52 – 54 . Plotting the rate of change of RhoB sensor activity as a function of RhoB sensor ac - tivity during the buildup phase ( approximately 6min before re - traction onset to 1min post retraction onset , shaded rectangle in Fig . 3c ) revealed a linear positive correlation ( Fig . 3d ) , i . e . , Rho activity increase accelerating with increasing Rho activity . This is consistent with active Rho engaging in a positive feedback loop to further increase its own activation , a phenomenon noted in other instances of excitable Rho behavior 55 , 56 . In addition , we ob - served pulsatile behavior ( Fig . 3i , Video 8 ) and propagating waves ( Fig . 3j , Video 9 ) of both RhoB sensor activity and edge retraction , patterns consistent with an excitable Rho signalling network . To confirm this finding , we repeated Rho buildup anal - yses using the DORA - RhoA and RhoA2G probes and observed similar pulsatile activation patterns and accelerating positive feedback phases , albeit on a smaller scale ( Fig . 3e - h ) . This was likely due to RhoA2G and DORA - RhoA’s reduced dynamic range , and cell geometric bias artificially increasing Rho activity near the cell edge ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Buildup profiles of Rac and Cdc42 activity in protrusion - retraction transitions showed a decrease in activity aligned with retraction onset but no pulsatile patterning ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Thus , Rho activity increases before retraction onset and is pulsatile , with rapid activation dur - ing and inactivation before the retraction process is completed . Rho , ROCK , NMII are part of an excitable system during mem - brane retractions Biological excitability is characterized by positive self - feedback which generates a rapid increase in activity , followed by delayed inhibition by a downstream effector that returns activity to basal levels 53 , 54 . Excitable signalling modules can drive cell protrusions during chemotaxis or propagating waves of actin polymeriza - tion 19 , 53 , 57 – 59 . Moreover , previous studies have found that Rho and its cytoskeletal effectors are excitable , resulting in pulsatile or wave - like propagation of Rho activity 55 , 56 , 60 , 61 . Interestingly , sev - eral studies identified that accumulation of the downstream target NMII with a delay relative to Rho can act as a negative regulator of Rho through recruitment of RhoGAPs 55 , 56 , 60 – 62 . To test whether this was the case during membrane retractions , we first coex - pressed fluorescently tagged myosin regulatory light chain ( mRuby3 - MLC ) and RhoB sensor in HT - HUVEC to analyze my - osin activation alongside edge velocity and Rho activity . The lo - calization - based myosin activity reporter mRuby3 - MLC is cyto - plasmic when inactive but forms distinct puncta when incorpo - rated into myosin filaments upon activation . Spatiotemporal anal - yses revealed that edge - proximal mRuby3 - MLC signal was low during protrusions and early retractions ( Fig . 4a , Video 10 ) . Lev - els increased in intensity beginning at retraction onset , peaking several minutes after maximal Rho activity levels ( Fig . 4b ) . Cross - correlation analysis between RhoB sensor and MLC - mRuby3 signal showed a delayed positive correlation ( Supple - mentary Fig . 4a ) , significantly highest at edge depths of 5 - 8µm ( Supplementary Fig . 4b , c ) , reflecting the absence of edge - proxi - mal myosin and localization to inward moving actin filaments . The slow , delayed accumulation of myosin following Rho activa - tion in protrusion - retraction events closely matched the Marshall - Burghardt et al . , 2023 ( preprint ) 5 of 19 C e ll O u t li ne R ho B - s en s o r Edge velocity - 5 min time 5 min S eg m en t ed c e ll ou t li ne R ho B s en s o r l o c a li z a t i on time - 5 : 00 - 2 : 05 - 0 : 50 0 : 00 0 : 50 2 : 05 5 : 00 ( min : sec ) Edge velocity ( µm / min ) 7 . 35 9 . 52 5 . 43 0 . 69 - 3 . 03 - 10 . 69 - 5 . 84 l o c a li z a t i on F R E T / C F P Protrusion Retraction FRET / CFP : 0 . 7 1 . 3 E dg e ve l o c i t y ( µ m / m i n ) - 12 - 8 - 4 0 4 8 12 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 1 . 1 1 . 2 1 . 3 D O RA - R ho A F R E T / C F P E dg e ve l o c i t y ( µ m / m i n ) - 12 - 8 - 4 0 4 8 12 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 1 . 1 1 . 2 1 . 3 R ho A 2 G F R E T / C F P 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 R ho B se n s o r F R E T / C F P E dg e ve l o c i t y ( µ m / m i n ) - 8 - 4 0 4 8 Time relative to retraction onset ( min ) - 8 4 8 0 - 4 Time relative to retraction onset ( min ) - 8 4 8 0 - 4 Time relative to retraction onset ( min ) - 8 4 8 0 - 4 RhoB sensor FRET / CFP 0 . 9 1 . 2 1 . 1 1 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 - 0 . 01 d ( R ho B se n s o r F R E T / C F P ) / d t DORA - RhoA FRET / CFP d ( D O RA - R ho A F R E T / C F P ) / d t 0 0 . 002 0 . 004 0 . 006 0 . 008 - 0 . 002 0 . 01 1 . 02 1 . 08 1 . 06 1 . 04 1 . 1 d ( R ho A 2 G F R E T / C F P ) / d t 0 0 . 002 0 . 004 0 . 006 0 . 008 0 . 01 1 . 12 1 . 08 1 . 04 1 . 16 1 . 2 RhoA2G FRET / CFP RhoB sensor DORA - RhoA RhoA2G a b d c f e h g i j 10 50 40 30 20 60 Time ( min ) 10 50 40 30 20 60 Time ( min ) 50 C oo r d i n a t e w i ndo w 100 150 0 50 C oo r d i n a t e w i ndo w 100 150 0 Time ( min ) 10 40 30 20 0 Time ( min ) 10 40 30 20 0 RhoB sensor FRET / CFP Edge velocity RhoB sensor FRET / CFP FRET / CFP : 0 . 7 1 . 3 edge velocity : - 10µm / min 10µm / min Figure 3 .

( i ) Diagram illustrating the relationship between Rho’s downstream effectors ROCK and NMII and the drugs used in c - h . Marshall - Burghardt et al . , 2023 ( preprint ) 7 of 19 localization of negative regulators in excitable system models 53 , consistent with NMII activation downstream of Rho activity be - ing part a negative regulator of Rho itself . To test this further , we measured RhoB sensor activity in response to acute treatments of cells with inhibitors of ROCK ( Y27632 , 20µM ) and myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK , ML7 , 20µM ) , i . e . , kinases acting upstream of NMII activation . We were unable to use blebbistatin as a direct inhibitor of myosin motor activity , as the color of solutions containing blebbistatin inter - fered with FRET - based Rho activity measurements . Consistent with NMII acting as a negative regulator of Rho , both drug addi - tions resulted in increased RhoB sensor activity , although with distinct kinetics . ML7 addition resulted in a sharp , transient in - crease ( Fig . 4c ) , whereas Y27632 addition caused a slower , but persistent increase of Rho activity ( Fig . 4d ) . Within MLCK - inhib - ited cells , stress fibers were maintained or increased , and RhoB sensor activity transiently increased in peripheral regions ( Fig . 4e , Video 11 ) , whereas ROCK inhibition caused sustained accumu - lation of RhoB sensor activity throughout the cells , particularly where stress fibers had dissolved , and except for peripheral ruf - fling regions ( Fig . 4f , Video 12 ) . Treating cells with both drugs resulted in a combined response reflective of the two independent pathways of MLC phosphorylation ( Fig . 4g ) . Consistent with ROCK and MLCK preferentially activating NMII in the cell inte - rior and the cell periphery , respectively , ROCK inhibition in - creased and MLCK inhibition decreased the cells’ adhesion sur - face 63 , 64 ( Fig . 4h ) . Together , both inhibitors increased Rho activ - ity , demonstrating generally that activated NMII negatively regu - lates Rho . Specifically , the sustained increase in Rho activity fol - lowing ROCK inhibition and stress fiber dissolution suggested that the Rho - ROCK - NMII pathway plays a critical role as a neg - ative regulator of excitable Rho activity ( Fig . 4i ) . Rho activity and ERM activation are spatiotemporally coupled Given that mRuby3 - MLC signal was at its lowest near the cell edge at retraction onset and accumulated with a substantial delay relative to Rho ( Fig . 4b ) , we questioned whether additional Rho effectors besides NMII were involved in driving early phases of membrane retractions . Rho is also known to activate ERMs through the kinases SLK and LOK 34 , 35 , 38 . Since release of cortical actin from the plasma membrane is necessary for the initiation of membrane protrusions 42 , 43 , we hypothesized that re - establishment of membrane - cortex attachment through activation of ERMs could be involved in retraction initiation . To test this , we first per - formed live - cell imaging of RhoB sensor and mRuby3 - MLC - ex - pressing HT - HUVEC , then fixed the cells and stained them using anti - pERM antibody that detects activated ( phosphorylated ) ERMs . Matching membrane retractions from time - lapse se - quences to pERM signals revealed a striking enrichment of pERM in retractions , consistent with Rho locally activating ERMs ( Fig . 5a , Video 13 ) . We also found that in ROCK and MLCK inhibited cells , locally increased Rho activity colocalized with locally in - creased pERM signals , further supporting Rho activity being up - stream of ERM activation ( Fig . 5b ) . We next sought to monitor the spatiotemporal relation - ship between Rho and ERM activation during membrane retrac - tions in live cells . We generated a localization - based ERM acti - vation reporter , composed of mRuby3 - tagged ezrin and cytoplasmic miRFP680 that we expressed stoichiometrically from the same mRNA through the use of a P2A ribosomal skipping se - quence 65 ( Fig . 5c ) . Since ERMs are recruited to the plasma mem - brane upon activation 39 , the pixel - by - pixel ratio of ezrin - mRuby3 / miRFP680 fluorescence is an indication of local ezrin activation . Analysis of cell - edge dynamics , RhoB sensor activity , and ezrin - mRuby3 / miRFP680 together revealed a striking spatio - temporal correlation of Rho activity and ezrin - mRuby3 / miRFP680 ( Fig . 5d , e , Video 14 ) . Activity buildup plots of both individual and compiled ( Fig . 5f , g ) protrusion - retraction events demonstrated no detectable time lag between Rho activa - tion and ezrin signal in retractions . This tight spatiotemporal cor - relation between Rho activity and active ezrin suggested that ERMs are immediate - early effectors of Rho , which serve to en - hance the force transmission between actin and the plasma mem - brane that is necessary during retractions . Rho rapidly activates ERMs via SLK / LOK To test whether SLK / LOK kinases are involved in ERM activa - tion downstream of Rho in HT - HUVEC ( Fig . 6a ) , we first char - acterized a recently developed SLK / LOK inhibitor ( Cpd31 ) 66 . Treatment of HT - HUVEC with Cpd31 caused an almost complete loss of pERM signal , as assessed by quantitative immunofluores - cence , with only some detectable pERM signal remaining in pe - ripheral structures resembling retraction fibers ( Fig . 6b ) . No ma - jor changes in the actin cytoskeleton of treated cells were apparent ( Fig . 6b ) . pERM signal decreased dose - dependently ( Fig . 6c , d ) , and occurred within 2 . 5min of Cpd31 addition at 5µM ( Fig . 6e , f ) . This surprisingly rapid loss of pERM upon SLK / LOK inhibition indicated a high turnover rate of ERM phosphorylation 38 . We next used acute treatment of cells with thrombin or nocodazole to as - sess Rho - dependent changes in pERM signals ( Fig . 6a ) . Throm - bin and nocodazole both rapidly activate Rho : Thrombin through the GPCR PAR - 1 67 ; nocodazole through release of microtubule - sequestered GEF - H1 , a Rho - specific GEF , from depolymerizing microtubules 68 , 69 . Both treatments caused rapid , concurrent in - creases in RhoB sensor activity ( Fig . 1e , Supplementary Fig . 5a ) and pERM signals ( Fig . 6g , h ) . Strikingly , the increases in pERM signal were potently suppressed when Cpd31 was present ( Fig . 6h , i ) . Treating cells with ROCK inhibitor ( Y27632 ) caused no significant reduction in pERM signals , indicating that ROCK is not required for ERM activation in HT - HUVEC ( Fig . 6g , h ) . Our results therefore demonstrate an essential role of SLK / LOK in rapid ERM activation downstream of Rho and argue for the Rho - SLK / LOK - ERM signaling axis being a highly responsive signal - ing module for the regulation of actin - membrane attachment and force transmission . SLK / LOK dependent ERM activation regulates cell morphol - ogy and is required for Rho - driven cell contractions Given the importance of Rho activity for cell shape homeostasis and cell contractions , we took advantage of the ability to selec - tively inhibit the Rho downstream targets ROCK / NMII ( using Y27632 ) and SLK / LOK / ERM ( using Cpd31 ) to identify their in - dividual or combined roles in these processes . For cell shape homeostasis , we plated HT - HUVEC with - out , or in presence of Cpd31 , Y27632 , or Cpd31 and Y27632 combined , fixed the cells after 2h , and stained them with the AF647 - conjugated surface label wheat germ agglutinin Marshall - Burghardt et al . , 2023 ( preprint ) 8 of 19 RhoB sensor FRET / CFP edge velocity ROI 1 ROI 2 ROI 2 ROI 1 ezrin - mRuby3 / miRFP680 ROI 2 ROI 1 R ho B s en s o r F R E T / C F P e z r i n - m R ub y 3 / m i R F P 680 anti - pERM , fixed Y 27632 , 30 m i n M L7 , 5 m i n c on t r o l RhoB sensor FRET / CFP live mRuby3 - MLC live anti - pERM fixed a b d e miRFP680 - NES ezrin - mRuby3 P2A Localization - based ezrin reporter FRET / CFP : 0 . 7 1 . 3 RhoB sensor FRET / CFP , live mRuby3 - MLC live FRET / CFP : 0 . 7 1 . 3 live , time - lapse fix & stain c Protrusion Retraction time - 2 : 55 - 1 : 40 - 0 : 50 0 : 00 0 : 50 1 : 40 2 : 55 ( min : sec ) 0 . 7 1 . 3 0 . 5 1 . 5 0 . 3 1 . 7 0 . 7 1 . 3 - 10µm / min 10 µm / min C oo r d i nda t e w i ndo w 50 100 150 0 time ( min ) 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 time ( min ) 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 time ( min ) 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 time relative to retraction onset ( min ) - 8 4 8 0 - 4 time relative to retraction onset ( min ) - 8 4 8 0 - 4 time relative to retraction onset ( min ) - 8 4 8 0 - 4 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 1 . 1 1 . 2 1 . 3 R ho B se n s o r F R E T / C F P e z r i n - m R ub y3 / m i R F P 680 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 R ho B se n s o r F R E T / C F P 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 5 1 . 3 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 3 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 1 1 . 3 1 . 5 1 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 6 1 . 3 1 . 5 e z r i n - m R ub y3 / m i R F P 680 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 1 1 . 3 1 . 5 1 . 6 1 . 7 1 . 8 ROI 1 : protr . - retr . transition ROI 2 : protr . - retr . transition g f Figure 5 .

The advantage of this protocol is that cells have not yet assumed heterogenous cell morphologies prior to ex - posure to the inhibitors , facilitating the detection of morphologi - cal phenotypes . Importantly , for all of the conditions tested , cells attached and spread to similar adhesion areas ( Fig . 7c ) . Y27632 treatment is known to cause elongated cell morphologies and re - traction defects 70 – 72 . We found that inhibition of either ROCK or SLK / LOK had similar effects , with cells having extended cellular processes ( Fig . 7a ) . To quantify drug - induced cell shape changes , we chose eccentricity and solidity as metrics . Eccentricity quanti - fies cell elongation and solidity is the ratio of cell area and the area of a cell’s convex hull ( cell compactness ) ( Fig . 7b , Materials and Methods ) . Both Cpd31 and Y27632 yielded significantly in - creased eccentricity and significantly reduced solidity ( Fig . 7d , e ) , and combined treatment had additive effects on both metrics ( Fig . 7d , e ) . These results indicated that the Rho effectors ROCK and SLK / LOK both contribute to cell shape homeostasis by restricting extended cellular processes . To directly assess the role of Rho - driven ERM activation in membrane retractions , we treated fully adhered cells with no - codazole , as it activates Rho and causes a reduced adhesion sur - face of cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) . Upon nocodazole addi - tion , cells rapidly contracted and many started blebbing ( Fig . 7f , g , Video 15 ) . Strikingly , when Cpd31 was added along with noco - dazole , both the fraction of cells blebbing and cell contractions were significantly reduced , demonstrating that SLK / LOK are re - quired for cells to exhibit a contractile response downstream of Rho ( Fig . 7f , g , h , i ) . In samples where cells were first treated with nocodazole for 30min to induce Rho - dependent blebbing , the ad - dition of Cpd31 increased cell spreading and a significant fraction of cells recovered from blebbing ( Fig . 7f , g , h , i , Video 15 ) . This suggested that the process of bleb retraction not only resolves blebs , but also maintains blebbing cells in a blebbing state . Intri - guingly , cells treated with combined nocodazole and Cpd31 often had “runaway” protrusions resulting in cell fragments that de - tached from the main cell body ( Fig . 7g ) . Importantly , Cpd31 treatment did not prevent nocodazole - induced Rho activation ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Together , our results demonstrate that the Rho effectors ROCK and SLK / LOK are both critical for Rho - induced cell con - tractions . Moreover , SLK / LOK activation of ERM downstream of Rho appears to be critical to safeguard cell integrity . Discussion By analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rho activity in ran - domly motile HT - HUVEC , we found that Rho was consistently elevated in µm and minute - scale cell edge retractions and consist - ently absent from protrusions . That Rho was elevated in retrac - tions was confirmed by the use of three different FRET probes and is consistent with both recent studies using FRET - based and localization - based reporters for Rho 21 , 22 and the generally ac - cepted role of Rho in activating NMII - dependent cell contractions through ROCK . Intriguingly , our spatiotemporal analysis revealed that Rho activity in retraction events displays hallmark characteristics of excitability , consistent with fast positive and slow / delayed neg - ative inhibition . This finding is supported by the multiple instances of excitable Rho activity generating contractile pulses in non - migratory contexts 55 , 56 , 60 , 61 . By including MLC or the ERM protein ezrin in our spatiotem - poral analyses of Rho dynamics , we found that MLC accumulated with a minute - scale delay at retracting cell edges relative to Rho activity , whereas ezrin showed high co - localization without de - tectable delay . In previous studies on excitable Rho dynamics , ac - tomyosin - associated RhoGAPs have been identified as negative regulators of Rho , in line with our findings that myosin inhibition increased Rho activity 56 , 60 , 73 . Therefore , it is likely that an acto - myosin - associated RhoGAP is recruited to retractions as they evolve , progressively shutting off Rho and ensuring contractions stop . While positive feedback to Rho most likely involves the recruitment of a RhoGEF 55 , 60 , 61 , 73 , 74 , it is less clear how this occurs during retractions . The tight spatiotemporal coupling between Rho and ezrin demonstrates that ERMs are early Rho effectors during retractions and indicates they could be components of a positive feedback mechanism . Both positive and negative feed - back from ERMs to Rho activity have been observed 35 , 75 , 76 . How - ever , negative feedback through ERMs is unlikely in our case , given the absence of delay between Rho and ezrin activation . Fo - cal adhesion dynamics may also contribute to regulating Rho dur - ing protrusion - retraction cycles . Focal adhesions have been shown to recruit RhoGEFs and GAPs in a maturation - dependent manner , with RacGEFs associated with newly formed adhesions near the cell edge and RacGAPs and RhoGEFs with mature adhe - sion sites deeper in the cell interior 77 . Furthermore , increased ten - sion on focal adhesions can recruit the RhoGEFs LARG and GEF - H1 78 , meaning greater Rho - induced contractility leads to higher Rho activity . Finally , local microtubule disassembly induces re - tractions 79 , and the interaction between focal adhesions and mi - crotubules can control Rho activity through the sequestration and release of GEF - H1 80 , further supporting a plausible role for GEF - H1 in Rho’s positive feedback . What are the specific roles of ERMs and NMII during Rho - dependent cell edge retractions ? The initial absence of NMII in early phases of retractions , despite elevated Rho , can be ex - plained by the absence of NMII filaments in branched lamellipo - dial actin networks 81 . Our results are consistent with a model in which ERMs are the main immediate effectors of Rho through SLK / LOK during early phases of cell edge retractions , by re - es - tablishing a link between plasma membrane and peripheral actin networks ( Fig . 7j ) . In adherent cells , these networks typically move radially inwards , due to NMII contractility and / or polymer - ization - driven treadmilling 82 – 84 , which in our model drags the membrane inwards once Rho - activated ERMs enable force trans - mission , with ERMs acting as the actin - PM clutch . Actin network remodeling occurs during early phases of edge retraction , progres - sively allowing for accumulation of NMII filaments 8 , 85 , which in turn exert contractile forces to further accelerate edge retraction . Increasingly remodeled and contractile actomyosin then recruits a putative RhoGAP , which shuts down Rho , with the observed delay , to resolve the retraction . Rho / ROCK - dependent NMII activation is important for cell migration and inhibiting ROCK causes a tail - retraction de - fect 70 – 72 .

( j ) Model for how excitable Rho activity drives cell contrac - tions through both ERM activation via SLK / LOK and ROCK - mediated actomyosin contractility ( see main text ) . Marshall - Burghardt et al . , 2023 ( preprint ) 12 of 19 ROCK inhibition , with extended cellular processes that failed to retract . The model that both NMII and ERMs are required for cell contractions was further supported by our results showing that Rho - induced cell contractions were impaired in the presence of the SLK / LOK inhibitor . Furthermore , cells that were induced to bleb in response to acute Rho activation stopped blebbing and started spreading when SLK / LOK inhibitor was added . Cells treated this way had aberrant “runaway” protrusions that occa - sionally detached from cells , highlighting the critical importance of Rho - dependent ERM activation through SLK / LOK for the maintenance of cellular integrity . In summary , our results show that in endothelial cells , Rho drives membrane retractions through two mechanisms that act sequentially during the cell edge retraction process : SLK / LOK - activated ERMs enhance actin - membrane attachment and force transmission , which enable ROCK - activated NMII to then effectively pull the membrane inwards , akin to ERMs acting as a clutch and NMII as a motor . Previous studies found that ini - tiation of cell protrusions is preceded by a local reduction in mem - brane - proximal actin or ezrin , and that protrusions stalled when actin - membrane attachment was enhanced through synthetic acti - vation of ezrin 42 , 43 . Therefore , in cells in which the Rho - SLK / LOK - ERM module exists , edge - proximal Rho activity ap - pears to be incompatible with driving membrane protrusions . Since RhoA has been proposed to drive cell edge protrusions by activating mDia1 14 , it will be important to investigate whether edge - proximal RhoA and ERMs are spatiotemporally correlated in these contexts . Our findings raise several important questions to be ad - dressed in future research . Which are the RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs that mediate Rho excitability in cell type and context - dependent manner , and is Rho excitability a general phenomenon in motile cells ? We found that Rho activity is self - limiting in randomly mo - tile cells , with activated NMII being part of a slow negative feed - back mechanism . If Rho activity is excitable during directed cell migration as well , this implies Rho activity is pulsatile rather than forming a stable rear - front gradient . Beyond cell motility and given accumulating evidence for actin - membrane attachment in regulating diverse cell morphogenetic processes , including mem - brane tension propagation 86 , we anticipate that our identification of ERMs as highly responsive Rho effectors will have far - reach - ing implications for our understanding of cell morphogenesis and migration .

Viral supernatants were collected at 48h post transfection , 0 . 22µm - filtered ( VWR CA28143 - 310 ) , concentrated using centrifugal filter units ( 100 kDa cutoff , MilliporeSigma , UFC910024 ) , aliquoted , and either used immediately or stored at - 80°C . Cell plating , live - cell , and fixed cell microscopy Optical 96 - well glass - bottom plates ( Cellvis P96 - 1 . 5H - N ) were coated with bovine collagen type I , 31µg / ml in PBS , for 2 - 4h at 37°C . Cells were plated at densities and for durations prior to fix - ation or live - cell imaging as specified . For live - cell imaging , cells were overlaid with a CO 2 - independent live - cell imaging solution ( LIS ) with low autofluorescence , composed of 125mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 1 . 5mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 5mM CaCl 2 , 10mM D - glucose , 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 % FBS and 5ng / ml bFGF , and plates were sealed during imaging using aluminum microplate seals ( Po - larSeal , Thomas Scientific 1152A34 ) .

Transient transfection of cDNA , synthetic Rho , Rac , Ccd42 ( in ) activation using rapamycin - induced heterodimerization HT - HUVEC expressing RhoB sensor , RaichuEV - Rac , or RaichuEV - Cdc42 were plated in collagen - coated wells of 96 - well glass - bottom plates at 15 , 000 cells / well the day before the trans - fection . The day of the transfection , the culture medium was re - placed with antibiotics - free full growth medium , 80µl per well . Then , 0 . 2µg of DNA ( LynFRB : mCherry - FKBP constructs 5 : 1 w / w ) and 0 . 25µl of Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scien - tific , 11668019 ) , diluted in 20µl OptiMEM ( Thermo Fisher Marshall - Burghardt et al . , 2023 ( preprint ) 14 of 19 Scientific , 31985070 ) , was added as per manufacturer’s recom - mendation . The transfection mix was replaced after 2h with full growth medium . 16 - 18h later , cells were overlaid with LIS and images captured using live cell imaging system 1 , using a 40x 1 . 3 NA oil objective lens , at 0 . 33µm / pixel resolution ( 2x2 binning ) . FRET , CFP , mCherry channels were acquired sequentially . 60 images were captured at 15s intervals , Rapamycin was added after timepoint 10 at 0 . 5µM final . Image analysis – background subtraction , cell segmentation and cell tracking Background images for each channel were generated by imaging wells without cells and filled with LIS . Multiple images from mul - tiple wells were averaged and subjected to circular image filtering using MATLAB functions imfilter and fspecial . To adjust raw im - ages of cells , the median intensity of neighboring pixels from the average background image was subtracted . Cell masks were gen - erated using histogram - based thresholding based on pixel inten - sity distribution of the YFP - FRET channel . To smooth the cell edge and refine the mask , Gaussian circular averaging filters were applied . To remove small debris trails attached to / touching cells , MATLAB functions imopen and strel were used to remove edge elements with a radius less than 1 pixel . Subsequent cell trajecto - ries were created using a nearest - neighbor consecutive pairing al - gorithm as described previously 19 . YFP - FRET and CFP channel alignment , FRET / CFP ratio , and fluorophore bleaching correction Methods for YFP - FRET and CFP channel registration have been described previously 19 . FRET / CFP ratios were computed as per - pixel ratios from background - subtracted , registered , and noise - fil - tered YFP - FRET and CFP images . By plotting FRET / CFP aver - aged per field of view over time from untreated samples , a bleach - ing correction curve was generated , displaying exponential - like decay . Assuming FRET / CFP across multiple untreated cells re - mained constant throughout an experiment , the FRET ratio array for each time frame was divided against the curve , normalizing it . Image analysis – mapping cell - edge velocity and RhoGTPase activities Cell edge velocities and RhoGTPase activities in peripheral coor - dinate windows were analyzed as described previously 19 . Briefly , the cell edge of segmented cells was divided into 900 equally spaced coordinate windows . For each coordinate window , veloc - ity vectors were formed by the dot product between a unit vector normal to the cell edge and the displacement vector from frame to frame . Coordinate windows were then binned into groups of 5 , forming 180 averaged coordinate windows , each with their own velocity vector . Coordinate windows had an adjustable depth pa - rameter , including 0 . 98 , 2 . 0 , 3 . 3 , 4 . 9 , 6 . 5 , and 8 . 1µm . FRET / CFP or any expressed protein’s value for each coordinate window was the average value of all pixels assigned to the window . To remove stochastic noise from edge velocity and FRET activity data , the MATLAB function ndnanfilter was applied . Image analysis – thresholding protrusions and retractions Cell edge velocity maps were first thresholded either above 3 . 9µm / min , creating a map of only protrusive activity , or below - 3 . 9µm / min to depict retractive activity . Using MATLAB’s bwareaopen function , we then applied a minimum size threshold of 25 pixels to each map , leaving distinct protrusion and retraction events above the size threshold . For each event , data such as area size , pixel IDs , time range , cell edge coordinate range , average edge velocity , average FRET activity were recorded . Cross - correlation analysis All cross - correlation analyses were performed using MATLAB’s xcorr function . Cell edge velocity and protein activation arrays were shifted to a Standard Normal  ( 0 , 1 ) distribution , using the Central Limit Theorem . To avoid a built - in time lag when com - paring FRET / CFP to edge velocity at a given frame x , edge ve - locities from frame x - 1 → x and x → x + 1 were averaged . Then , cross - correlation was computed for each window coordinate vec - tor of all time points , yielding 180 correlation vectors . These were averaged to form one cross - correlation vector per cell . The overall cross correlation for a given experimental condition was obtained by averaging the vectors from all cells analyzed . Edge velocity vs . RhoGTPase activity buildup plots Previously generated edge velocity accompanying FRET / CFP ar - rays from sample cells were loaded and processed using MATLAB . To avoid bias , only edge velocity maps were visual - ized when choosing protrusion - retraction transition events . Rec - tangular regions of interest undergoing protrusion retraction cy - cling were identified . A region of interest spanning 15 coordinate windows or 8 . 3 % of the cell perimeter was created . Only events with > 20 frames or 8 . 3min of averaged positive edge velocity preceding the transition event were used . The exact transition point from protrusion to retraction was identified as the first frame x with ( i ) negative acceleration , ( ii ) positive edge velocity at frame x - 1 , and negative edge velocity at frame x . Between frame x - 1 and x , the frame with lowest absolute - valued edge velocity was used as the transition point . The length of the rectangular ROI was 41 frames , using ± 20 frames before and after the transition frame ( Supplementary Fig . 2 a , b ) . Edge velocity and FRET / CFP at a chosen edge depth were plotted on the same graph ( Supple - mentary Fig . 2c ) . Image analysis – ezrin - mRuby3 / miRFP680 ratio calculation Ezrin - mRuby3 and miRFP680 image channels were background corrected and segmented using the YFP - FRET derived cell mask . Circular averaging image filters were applied to each channel ( ndanfilter and fspecial in MATLAB ) . Each channel was normal - ized to its bleaching curve . Then , the per - pixel ezrin - mRuby3 / miRFP680 ratio was computed . The 1 st and 99 th percen - tile values of the ratio were calculated , and used as the lower and upper limits , i . e . , any ratio value less than the 1st percentile was rounded up to the first percentile , and any values above the 99 th percentile was rounded down to the 99 th percentile . This was to avoid outlier extreme ratio values due to stochastic noise . Quantitative immunofluorescence Fixed cells in 96 - well glass bottom dishes were stained with 1 : 400 diluted anti - pERM antibody , ( 1 : 1000 diluted AF568 - conugated secondary antibody ) , 1 : 200 diluted AF488 - conjugated phalloidin , and 1 : 10 , 000 diluted Hoechst . 16 images were captured per well , using a 20x 0 . 75 NA air objective at 0 . 33µm / pixel resolution . Im - ages with visible staining or imaging artifacts were discarded , the remaining analysis was fully automated . Cell nuclei were detected based on the Hoechst images using a previously described Marshall - Burghardt et al . , 2023 ( preprint ) 15 of 19 MATLAB routine 93 . The nuclei in the resulting mask were dilated by 7 pixels ( 2 . 3µm ) and the resulting image regions used to deter - mine per - cell pERM signals , using background - subtracted pERM images . RhoGTPase activity response to rapamycin - induced Rho , Rac and Cdc42 ( in ) activation Images were processed and raw FRET / CFP ratios were computed as described above . An interactive custom MATLAB routine was then used to manually identify cells co - expressing mCherry - FKBP - tagged RhoGTPase regulatory domains and Lyn - FRB , based on the presence of mCherry fluorescence . ROIs were drawn within cells identified this way and the corresponding raw FRET / CFP time - courses automatically computed . For controls , ROIs were drawn in cells without mCherry expression . All time - courses were first individually normalized to the average FRET / CFP of the timepoints prior to rapamycin addition . Then , the time - courses of mCherry - expressing cells were normalized by averaged control time - courses , before averaging per condition , across two biological replicates . RhoGTPase activity responses to drug additions Cells were plated 3 - 4h before imaging in collagen - coated glass - bottom 96 well plates at a density of 2 , 000 cells / well . Full growth medium was replaced with LIS 1h prior to imaging . Time lapse sequences were acquired at 20x magnification , 2x2 binning , 0 . 65µm / pixel , at 1min intervals for 60min . Drugs diluted in LIS and LIS only ( control ) were added to wells after indicated times . Image data was processed as described above and a pixel - wise YFP - FRET / CFP calculation was performed . For each field of view , average Rho - FRET activity per frame was calculated and normalized ( 1 ) to its own FRET average in the frames pre - drug addition , and ( 2 ) to the mean control FRET response from all con - trol FOVs . These normalizations scaled each FRET response to 1 during the pre - drug addition period and accounted for any in - crease in FRET activity due to the addition of control LIS . Cell shape analysis HT - HUVEC were seeded at 750 cells per well on collagen - coated 96 - well glass - bottom plates in either full growth medium ( con - trol ) or full growth medium supplemented with either Cpd31 ( 5µM ) , Y27632 ( 10µM ) , or both Cpd31 ( 5µM ) and Y27632 ( 10µM ) . Cells were incubated for 2h at 37°C , before fixation with 2 % formaldehyde in PBS and staining with AF647 - conjugated wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA , 2 . 5µg / ml in PBS , 10min at RT ) as a membrane marker and Hoechst ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) to stain the nuclei . Images were then acquired using live - cell imaging system 4 , ac - quiring 16 sites per well across 30 - 40 wells at 20x magnification with a pixel size of 0 . 33µm . Image processing was performed us - ing custom MATLAB code . Objects ( cells ) were automatically detected and cropped from each image . To exclude cell debris and other particles , only objects with an area greater than 3 , 000 pixels were retained . Object properties ( centroid coordinates , area , ec - centricity , solidity , major axis length , minor axis length , perime - ter , major axis orientation and mean intensity ) were then extracted from each cropped image , as defined by MATLAB’s built - in re - gionprops function . Solidity is defined as the ratio of the area oc - cupied by the cell over the area of the convex hull of the cell shape . Eccentricity is defined as the ratio between the inter - focal distance and the major axis of an ellipsoid . The number of objects in the nuclear and cell masks were used to discard objects without a nucleus ( i . e . , large cell debris ) , and cases with more than one nucleus but only one object ( i . e . , cells touching each other and bi - nucleate cells ) . Cell area and blebbing quantification RhoB sensor - expressing HT - HUVEC were seeded at 1 , 000 cells per well in collagen - coated 96 - well glass - bottom plates and incu - bated in full growth medium for 3 - 4h before replacing the full growth medium by LIS . At specified times during image acquisi - tion , LIS ( control ) , nocodazole ( 15µM ) , both nocodazole ( 15µM ) and Cpd31 ( 5µM ) or Cpd31 ( 5µM ) were administered to the cor - responding wells . Image series were acquired using live - cell im - aging system 3 or 4 at 1min intervals over 135min in the YFP channel using 10x magnification and 0 . 65µm / pixel resolution . Image analysis was performed using custom MATLAB code . The image series were registered using the hardware stage position data and the background illumination profile was corrected using images from wells left without cells . Cell segmentation was then performed using a local minima histogram - based segmentation algorithm to extract cell occupancy area per field of view per frame . Then , cells were manually counted and classified as either blebbing or spread from images taken from one frame before drug addition and at the end of the time series . Statistical testing and reproducibility For comparison of two groups , the non - parametric Whitney - Mann U rank sum test was used . For comparison of multiple groups , one - way ANOVA followed by the Tukey - Cramer’s pair - wise comparisons were performed . All data shown are from mul - tiple biological and technical replicates , as specified in the figure legends . Statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB or Graphpad Prism .
