The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF - 1 requires the tyrosine residues 421 , 482 and 466 , which are targeted by the protein tyrosine kinase Src in vitro . Furthermore , FGF - 1 is unable to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin within the cells derived from Src knockout mice ( Src 7 / 7 ) , indicating that Src is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF - 1 . Although Src 7 / 7 cells are able to undergo rapid proliferation , they are impaired to respond to FGF - 1 for the shape change and cell migration . Morphological analysis further reveals that FGF - 1 fails to induce the formation of polarized lamellipodia and the translocation of cortactin into the leading edge of Src 7 / 7 cells . Consistent with the mitogenic response to FGF - 1 , the lack of Src does not a(cid:128)ect the tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of Snt ( or Frs2 ) , a FGF - 1 early signaling protein that links to Ras . Therefore , our data support the notion that Src and cortactin participate in a FGF signal pathway for cell migration and shape change rather than mitogenesis . Keywords : Src ; FGF - 1 ; cortactin Introduction The family of ﬁbroblast growth factor ( FGF ) represents a large group of polypeptides that play important roles in embryonic development , tissue growth , wound healing , and angiogenesis ( Burgess et al . , 1989 ) . The prototypes of FGF , namely FGF - 1 and FGF - 2 , are mitogenic and chemotactic for many mesenchyme - derived cells ( Gospodarowicz , 1974 ; Maciag et al . , 1982 ) . During the early response to FGF - 1 or FGF - 2 , several intracellular proteins are phosphorylated at tyrosine residues ( Huang et al . , 1986 ) . These phospho - tyrosyl proteins include phospholipase C g ( PLC - g ) , Snt ( or Frs2 ) , Shc , Gab - 1 , and MAP kinases ( Bogoyevitch et al . , 1994 ; Burgess et al . , 1990 ; Kouhara et al . , 1997 ; Ong et al . , 1997 ; Wang et al . , 1994 , 1996 ) . Whereas PLC - g is important for FGF - mediated phosphatidylinositol turn - over , it is not necessary for FGF - induced mitogenesis ( Mohammadi et al . , 1992 ; Peters et al . , 1992 ) . Snt encodes a protein that has an electrophoretic motility around 90 kDa ( Kouhara et al . , 1997 ) and binds to FGF receptor 1 ( FGFR - 1 ) through its phosphotyrosine binding domain in a phosphotyrosine independent manner ( Xu et al . , 1998 ) . Snt functions as a lipid - anchored docking protein and targets the signaling adaptor Grb - 2 , either directly or through Sph - 2 protein tyrosine phosphatase , to the plasma membrane ( Hadari et al . , 1998 ; Kouhara et al . , 1997 ) . Because Grb - 2 binds to Sos , a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( Buday et al . , 1993 ; Egan et al . , 1993 ; Rozakis - Adcock et al . , 1993 ) , Snt is likely to be a primary component involved in the activation of the complexes of Ras / Raf / mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , the major signal pathway from the plasma membrane to the nucleus . Likewise , Gab - 1 ( an IRS - related protein ) and Shc act also as signaling adaptors and are likely involved in the similar pathway to the activation of Ras ( Holgado - Madruga et al . , 1996 ; Rozakis - Adcock et al . , 1992 ) . Although the exact roles of these molecules in the biological function of FGF are not fully elucidated , it is assumed that these factors may ultimately be important for the FGF’s mitogenic activity . It is less understood , however , how FGFs signal cell shape changes and migration . We have previously shown that FGF - 1 requires a prolonged stimulation to reach a maximal mitogenic response ( Zhan et al . , 1993a ) . Analysis of this late response ( 4 – 12 h ) has revealed a series of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins that are not apparent during the early response . One of these proteins was characterized as cortactin , a prominent substrate of Src protein tyrosine kinase ( Zhan et al . , 1993b ) . Cortactin is also a potent cross - linker for ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) and co - localizes with F - actin in cell peripheral areas and punctate - like membrane structures ( Wu et al . , 1993 ) . We have recently described that the F - actin cross - linking activity of cortactin can be attenuated by Src - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , overexpression of a cortactin mutated at tyrosine phosphorylation sites impairs the migration of endothelial cells ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , these data indicate that cortactin acts as a modulator for the actin cytoskeleton . The evidence for the role of Src in FGF signaling also begins emerging . In a previous investigation of FGF signaling , we described that the activated FGFR - 1 is able to transiently associate with Src - like proteins in a manner dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR - 1 and the SH2 domain of Src ( Zhan et al . , 1994 ) . Overexpression of a normal Src can increase the response to FGF - 1 mediated cellular scattering and motility ( Rodier et al . , 1995 ) . On the other hand , overexpression of a mutated form of Src inhibits the * Correspondence : X Zhan , Department of Experimental Pathology , Holland Laboratory of American Red Cross , 15601 Crabbs Branch Way , Rockville , Maryland , MD 20855 , USA Received 7 December 1998 ; revised 1 July 1999 ; accepted 6 July 1999 Oncogene ( 1999 ) 18 , 6700 – 6706 ª 1999 Stockton Press All rights reserved 0950 – 9232 / 99 $ 15 . 00 http : / / www . stockton - press . co . uk / onc scattering response without a(cid:128)ecting mitogenesis induced by FGF - 1 or EGF . In addition , the early withdrawal of FGF - 1 from culture medium can induce cell migration without promoting DNA synthesis , this property is apparently correlated with a transient increase in Src kinase activity ( LaVallee et al . , 1998 ) . While these studies suggest that a Src - related activity may be involved in a FGF signaling independent on mitogenesis , neither the speciﬁc Src family members nor particular Src substrates have been deﬁned . Furthermore , direct genetic evidence for the role of Src in the growth factor induced cell migration is still missing . In this report , we examined whether Src is required for the FGF - 1 mediated tyrosine phosphor - ylation of cortactin within the cells derived from Src knockout mice . We found that a cortactin mutated at the tyrosine residues that are targeted by Src is impaired to respond to FGF - 1 stimulation . In addition , cells lacking the Src gene are able to undergo proliferation in the presence of FGF - 1 , though these cells show fewer changes in morphology and have slower motility compared to normal cells . Further - more , FGF - 1 is able to induce tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of Snt but not cortactin in Src knockout cells . These ﬁndings demonstrate that Src is the major kinase responsible for FGF - 1 - induced tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of cortactin , and Src and cortactin are implicated in a signal pathway for cell migration and shape change , which is apparently distinct from that involved in the mitogenic response . Results Src is essential for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF - 1 In the attempt to verify that Src is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF - 1 , we initially evaluated whether the tyrosine residues targeted by Src are necessary for FGF - 1 mediated phosphorylation . In a previous study , we determined that the primary tyrosine residues targeted by Src reside at Tyr - 421 , Tyr - 466 and Tyr - 482 ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , we analysed NIH3T3 cells expressing myc - Cort F421F466F482 , a cortactin mutant in which the three tyrosine residues are replaced with phenylalanines and the NH2 - terminus is fused to the myc epitope ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . As a control , a wild - type murine cortactin fused to the same myc epitope ( myc - cortactin ) was analysed in parallel . As shown in Figure 1 , the level of tyrosine phosphorylated myc - cortactin signiﬁcantly increased within 12 h after FGF - 1 stimulation . In contrast , the mutant Cort F421F466F482 failed to increase in its tyrosine phosphorylation in response to FGF - 1 . This result indicates that the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF - 1 occurs at the same residues that are targeted by Src . To further conﬁrm the role of Src in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin , we examined embryo - nic ﬁbroblasts derived from the Src - knockout mice ( Src 7 / 7 ) and ﬁbroblasts derived from a normal mouse embryo ( Src + / + ) . The cells were maintained at near conﬂuence in a serum - free deﬁned medium supplemented with insulin ( DMI ) for 48 h and subsequently stimulated with FGF - 1 for various times . The total cell lysates were prepared and analysed by immunophosphoty - rosine blot analysis . It appeared that Snt , which is a major FGF responsive protein and migrates at 90 kDa , was induced similarly in both types of cells ( Figure 2a ) . Figure 1 Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF - 1 requires the tyrosine residues targeted by Src . Quiescent NIH3T3 cells expressing myc - Cort and myc - Cort F421F466F466 were stimulated with FGF - 1 for 12 h . The lysates from the stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal cortactin antibody 9E - 10 and further immunoblotted with a polyclonal phosphotyrosine antibody . The same blot was stripped and re - probed with the polyclonal cortactin antibody C001 Figure 2 Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in Src 7 / 7 cells . ( a ) Quiescent Src 7 / 7 and Src + / + cells were treated with FGF - 1 for the times indicated . Total cell lysates were prepared by dissolving stimulated cells in SDS sample bu(cid:128)er . The lysates were then separated in SDS – PAGE and further blotted with monoclonal anti - phosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) as described in Materials and methods . ( b ) FGF - 1 stimulated cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal cortactin antibody . The precipitates were immunoblotted with monoclonal anti - phospho - tyrosine antibody 4G10 The role of Src in the function of FGF - 1 J Liu et al 6701 However , a phosphorylated band around 80 kDa was detected only in Src + / + but not in Src 7 / 7 cells ( Figure 2a ) . The p80 band apparently co - migrated with cortactin ( data not shown ) , which was further conﬁrmed by immunoprecipitation with a cortactin antibody followed by immunophosphotyrosine blot analysis . As shown in Figure 2b , cortactin was hyperphosphorylated signiﬁcantly in Src + / + cells after 12 h of FGF - 1 stimulation . In contrast , it was weakly phosphorylated within Src 7 / 7 cells , although there was a slight increase in tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of cortactin at 24 h of stimulation . This slight increase observed at 24 h was apparently due to a di(cid:128)erential sample loading as indicated by analysing the same blot using a cortactin antibody ( Figure 2b , the lower panel ) . Interestingly , we also observed several other phosphotyrosyl bands including one of 70 kDa and two bands between 130 – 200 kDa , which were actually enhanced in the FGF - 1 stimulated Src 7 / 7 cells ( Figure 2a ) . However , the identities of these bands are currently unknown . Taken together , these data demonstrated that Src is likely the primary kinase for FGF - induced phos - phorylation of cortactin , and cortactin is apparently one of the major phosphotyrosyl proteins induced by FGF - 1 in a Src - dependent manner . Src is required for FGF - 1 - mediated cell shape change and migration To elucidate the role of Src in the function of FGF - 1 , we also examined the morphological response of Src 7 / 7 and Src + / + to FGF - 1 . Under serum - starved culture conditions , both types of cells exhibited a typical quiescent morphology characterized by a ﬂat mono - layer ( Figure 3 ) . When the cells were exposed to FGF - Figure 3 FGF - 1 induces di(cid:128)erent morphological changes in Src 7 / 7 and Src + / + cells . Quiescent Src 7 / 7 ( a , c , e and g ) and Src + / + ( b , d , f and h ) cells were stimulated with FGF - 1 for various times ( a and b , 0 h ; c and d , 6 h ; e and f , 12 h ; g and h , 24 h ) . Cells were inspected under a phase - contrast microscope Figure 4 Redistribution of cortactin within Src 7 / 7 cells is impaired . Quiescent Src 7 / 7 ( a – d ) and Src + / + cells ( e – h ) were stimulated with or without FGF - 1 for 15 h ( a , b , e and f ) : untreated ; c , d , g and h : FGF - 1 treated ) . The cells were then double - stained with the polyclonal cortactin antibody C001 ( a , c , e and g ) and FITC - phalloidin ( b , d , f and h ) as described in Materials and methods . The stained cells were examined under a confocal microscope The role of Src in the function of FGF - 1 J Liu et al 6702 1 for 12 h , Src + / + cells underwent a signiﬁcant shape change typiﬁed by a greatly elongated cytoplasm ( Figure 3 ) . However , this change was not observed when Src 7 / 7 cells were analysed , although many of these cells round up after 12 h of FGF - 1 stimulation . A close examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy also revealed a di(cid:128)erential cortactin staining between these two types of cells . While cortactin was found within the areas around the periphery , the peri - nucleus , and punctate - like struc - tures within the cytoplasm of both quiescent cells ( Figure 4a , e ) , cortactin and F - actin co - stained abun - dantly within polarized lamellipodia , as deﬁned by large intervening regions of the Src + / + cells at 12 h stimulation ( Figure 4g , h ) . Concomitant with the association of more cortactin proteins with these polarized leading structures , less cortactin staining was detected in the peri - nucleus of FGF - 1 treated Src + / + cells . In contrast , the Src 7 / 7 cells treated with FGF - 1 did not show signiﬁcantly polarized lamellipo - dia associated with cortactin and F - actin ( Figure 4c , d ) . Instead , cortactin was more enriched at the peri - nucleus within those cells ( Figure 4c ) . The di(cid:128)erential response of these cells to FGF - 1 with respect to the morphological changes was apparently correlated with their motility as analysed by a wound - healing assay . As shown in Figure 5 , both Src 7 / 7 and Src + / + cells did not show apparent migration within 6 h into the wounded areas gener - ated by a rubber policeman when FGF - 1 was absent ( Figure 5a , c ) . In the presence of FGF - 1 , however , Src + / + cells displayed extensive elongation of their cytoplasm . Concomitant with the elongated morphol - ogy , many Src + / + cells were found in the wounded area ( Figure 5d ) . In contrast , few Src 7 / 7 cells showed migration , although many of them exhibited round - ing - up morphology ( Figure 5b ) . Figure 5 The lack of Src impairs cell migration . Quiescent Src 7 / 7 ( a and b ) and Src + / + cells ( c and d ) were stimulated with ( b and d ) or without FGF - 1 ( a and c ) . After 20 h of stimulation , the monolayers were wounded with a rubber policeman . The photographs were taken at 6 h after wounding Figure 6 The lack of Src does not a(cid:128)ect cell proliferation . Src 7 / 7 and Src + / + cells were seeded at 1 6 10 4 cells per well in a 24 - well plate . At 8 h after plating , the culture medium was changed to DMI supplemented with FGF - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) and heparin ( 10 units / ml ) . In the control samples , cells were maintained in DMI . At the times indicated , cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer . Each time point represents a mean of three independent experiments . Labels : * , Src 7 / 7 in DMI only ; & , Src 7 / 7 in DMI plus FGF - 1 ; ~ , Src + / + in DMI ; and ! , Src + / + in DMI plus FGF - 1 The role of Src in the function of FGF - 1 J Liu et al 6703 Src is not required for FGF - 1 mediated cell proliferation The rounding - up morphology exhibited by Src 7 / 7 cells in the presence of FGF - 1 suggested that those cells were able to undergo mitosis . To further conﬁrm this notion , we have measured their proliferative response to FGF - 1 . Both Src 7 / 7 and Src + / + cells were plated at approximately 5 % conﬂuence and maintained in DMI supplemented with FGF - 1 . As shown in Figure 6 , both types of cells grew in a FGF - 1 - dependent manner . Interestingly , Src 7 / 7 cells appeared to grow even faster than Src + / + cells . The maximal number of Src 7 / 7 cells in the presence of FGF - 1 was nearly four times higher than that of Src + / + cells ( Figure 6 ) . Thus , the lack of Src apparently does not inhibit but actually enhances the response to FGF - 1 for proliferation . Discussion In this study , we provided evidence that Src is required for FGF - 1 - mediated shape change and cell migration . Our conclusion further supports the notion that Src plays a vital role in the signaling pathways for cell migration and shape change triggered by growth factors . However , our data also demonstrate that Src is not required for the FGF - 1 mediated cell proliferation . In fact , the cells lacking Src grow much faster than normal cells ( Figure 6 ) . Consistent with the mitogenic response to FGF - 1 , the lack of Src does not impair the tyrosine phosphorylation of Snt ( or Frs2 ) . Snt has been shown to be a direct substrate for FGF receptors ( Xu et al . , 1998 ) . Because Snt shares homologous sequence with insulin receptor substrate 1 , and binds to Grb - 2 proteins , it is likely a major signaling molecule linking to the Ras / MAPK pathway and is essential for FGF’s mitogenic activity . Thus , it appears that Src and cortactin are involved in a discrete signal pathway that primarily regulates the cytoskeletal changes . In support of this notion , transient FGF stimulation does not induce a maximum DNA synthesis but is able to induce the activation of Src and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin ( LaVallee et al . , 1998 ) . Furthermore , it is known that oncogenic Src ( v - Src ) transforms cells in a manner independent of MAPK , a key component for its mitogenic activity ( Oldham et al . , 1998 ) . In light of the presence of many members in the Src family and other non - receptor tyrosine kinases ( Thomas et al . , 1997 ) , FGF - 1 could utilize kinases other than Src to phosphorylate these molecules , as indicated by a recent report that FER , a non Src - related intracellular tyrosine kinases , is involved in a PDGF - mediated cortactin phosphorylation ( Kim et al . , 1998 ) . However , we found that the tyrosine phosphor - ylation of cortactin induced by FGF - 1 is signiﬁcantly impaired in the cells deﬁcient in Src alone . Further - more , the tyrosine residues targeted by Src are the same as those mediated by FGF - 1 ( Figure 1 ) . These results reinforce the notion that cortactin is a preferred substate for Src compared to other Src - related kinases ( Thomas et al . , 1995 ) . It is also noteworthy that cortactin is the major tyrosine phosphorylated protein that is impaired in FGF - 1 - induced Src 7 / 7 cells ( Figure 6a ) . Cortactin is a cell periphery - associated protein that binds to and cross - links ﬁlamentous actin ( Huang et al . , 1997 ; Zhan et al . , 1993b ) . In quiescent Src 7 / 7 or Src + / + cells , cortactin localizes evenly around the cell margins . This is consistent with our previous report that a mutant lacking tyrosine phosphorylation sites is still able to associate with cell peripheral structures in endothelial cells ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . However , in FGF - stimulated Src + / + cells , the majority of cortactin was accumulated in the leading edges of the cells . This accumulation was apparently impaired within Src 7 / 7 cells , where cortactin is more concentrated around the nucleus . Thus , it appears that Src is required for the dynamic movement of cortactin within the cytoplasm . Interestingly , the rearranged cortactin co - localizes with F - actin either in newly formed lamellipodia in normal cells ( Figure 4h ) or around the nucleus ( Figure 4d ) in Src 7 / 7 cells , indicating that the movement of cortactin within cells is coupled with F - actin . A recent report has described that Rac is involved in the translocation of cortactin in PDGF - stimulated cells ( Weed et al . , 1998 ) . While Src can reportedly activate Ras - like GTPase ( Chang et al . , 1995 ; Schie(cid:128)er et al . , 1996 ) , the lack of Src is unlikely to a(cid:128)ect the activation of Rac in FGF treated cells because Src is not required for the activation of Snt , a primary signaling molecule that links to Ras , which in turn can activate Rac ( Hall , 1998 ) . Alternatively , the dynamic movement of cortactin requires its tyrosine phosphorylation , which apparently attenuates its F - actin cross - linking activity ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . It has been suggested that the movement of cellular particles is due to a retrograde actin ﬂow , a movement of newly formed actin ﬁlaments from the front of lamellipodia to the opposite direction of cell forward ( Cramer , 1997 ) . One model for the driving actin retrograde ﬂow is that disassociation of cross - linked actin network at the back of the lamellipodium will generate a tension gradient which can drive retrograde ﬂow of actin ( Mogilner et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , it will be of interest to deﬁne whether cortactin is involved in a driving force for actin retrograde ﬂow . Further experiments using mutants for each of these pathways should dissect the mechanism for the cortactin translocation induced by FGF - 1 .
