Degradation occurs at speciﬁc sites where invasive cells make contact with the ECM via specialized plasma membrane protrusions termed invadopo - dia . Herein , we show that the dynamin 2 ( Dyn2 ) , a GTPase implicated in the control of actin - driven cytoskeletal remodeling events and membrane transport , is necessary for focalized matrix degradation at invadopodia . Dynamin was inhibited by using two approaches : 1 ) expression of dominant negative GTPase - impaired or proline - rich domain - deleted Dyn2 mutants ; and 2 ) inhi - bition of the dynamin regulator calcineurin by cyclosporin A . In both cases , the number and extension of ECM degradation foci were drastically reduced . To understand the site and mech - anism of dynamin action , the cellular structures devoted to ECM degradation were analyzed by correlative confocal light - electron microscopy . Invadopodia were found to be organized into a previously undescribed ECM - degradation structure consisting of a large invagination of the ventral plasma membrane surface in close spatial relationship with the Golgi complex . Dyn2 seemed to be concentrated at invadopodia . INTRODUCTION Degradation of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is a critical process during cell invasion in both physiological and pathological processes such as morphogenesis , differentia - tion , cell migration , apoptosis , and tumor invasion ( re - viewed in Basbaum and Werb , 1996 ) . For example , meta - static tumor cells need to overcome the natural barriers impeding access to vascular or lymphatic pathways and to alter the extracellular environment to allow cancer growth in distant locations ( reviewed in Foda and Zucker , 2001 ) . This requires the direct participation of released and exposed proteases such as urokinase - type plasminogen activator , ly - sosomal proteases , and matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) ; MMPs in particular are thought to play a major role in the degradation of ECM . To reach the plasma membrane , pro - teases must be transported and processed by the secretory pathway . Although the mechanisms of release , intracellular trafﬁcking and sorting of lysosomal proteases ( reviewed in Dell’Angelica and Payne , 2001 ) and their regulation ( Radons et al . , 1994 ; Baldassarre et al . , 2000 ) , have been studied and partly elucidated , surprisingly , much less is known concern - ing the trafﬁcking of the functionally more crucial MMPs , especially the membrane - bound forms ( Hotary et al . , 2000 ) . Because the focalized delivery / exposure of MMPs is likely to be a crucial factor in physiological ECM remodeling events and cell invasive behavior ( Basbaum and Werb , 1996 ) , a key feature of the trafﬁcking of MMPs is their targeting to specialized plasma membrane structures , where ECM degradation occurs ( Chen , 1989 ; Mueller and Chen , 1991 ; Chen and Wang , 1999 ) . At the ultrastructural level , these structures have been suggested to consist of 200 - nm - wide and up to 3 - (cid:1) m - long membrane protrusions extending into the matrix ( Mueller and Chen , 1991 ; Bowden et al . , 2001 ) , prominent in invasive cells .

Online version is available at www . molbiolcell . org . 1074 © 2003 by The American Society for Cell Biology they have been termed invadopodia . The molecular compo - sition of invadopodia at sites of ECM degradation is par - tially known . Invadopodial protrusions are enriched in in - tegrins and associated tyrosine kinase signaling machinery , metalloproteases and , quite prominently , in actin and actin - associated proteins ( Mueller et al . , 1992 ; Monsky et al . , 1994 ; Chen , 1996 ; Nakahara et al . , 1998 ; Bowden et al . , 1999 ; Der - yugina et al . , 2001 ) . Herein , we report that the GTPase dy - namin plays an essential role in the focal degradation of ECM at invadopodia . The 100 - kDa GTPase dynamin has been demonstrated to be required in endocytic membrane ﬁssion , caveolae inter - nalization , and protein trafﬁcking at the Golgi apparatus ( Schmid et al . , 1998 ; Hinshaw , 2000 ; McNiven et al . , 2000a ) . The various dynamin isoforms are multidomain proteins featuring , in addition to a GTPase domain , a pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) implicated in membrane binding , a GTPase effector domain shown to be essential for self - assem - bly and stimulated GTPase activity , and a C - terminal pro - line - rich domain ( PRD ) , which contains several SH3 - binding sites . Dynamin partners generally bind to the PRD and may either stimulate dynamin’s GTPase activity or target dy - namin to the plasma membrane ( Schmid et al . , 1998 ; Hin - shaw , 2000 ) . Of note , the binding of phosphoinositides to the well - characterized PH domain of dynamin affect both GTPase activity and self - assembly ( Lee et al . , 1999 ; Vallis et al . , 1999 ; Muhlberg and Schmid , 2000 ) and the interactions between the dynamin PH domain and phosphoinositides are important for dynamin function in vivo ; indeed , deletion of the PH domain impairs at least some of dynamin’s func - tions ( Achiriloaie et al . , 1999 ; Vallis et al . , 1999 ) . Recent work points to the ubiquitous dynamin 2 form ( Dyn2 ) as being capable of interacting with the actin cytoskeleton in regulat - ing actin ﬁlament reorganization and subsequently cell shape via cortactin ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) , actin comet formation ( Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) , internalization of particles during phagocytosis ( Gold et al . , 1999 ) , and the formation of podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , an actin - containing plasma membrane structure proposed to mediate cell adhesion and motility of phagocytic cells ( Zam - bonin - Zallone et al . , 1988 ; Nitsch et al . , 1989 ) . Because these ﬁndings propose Dyn2 as a key regulatory molecule in at least some types of actin - driven cytoskeletal machineries , and in linking the cytoskeleton to both membrane trafﬁck - ing / remodeling and signaling events ( Hinshaw , 2000 ) , we examined whether Dyn2 plays a role in ECM invasion me - diated by invadopodia . We report that 1 ) Dyn2 activity is necessary for ECM degradation by invasive tumor cells ; 2 ) invadopodia are organized in a novel ECM - degradation structure ( EDS ) con - sisting of a large invagination of the ventral plasma mem - brane surface in close spatial relationship with the Golgi complex ; and 3 ) the effect of Dyn2 in focal matrix degrada - tion is mediated by an essential role in the organization and function of these novel matrix degradation structures . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs and Antibodies All the Dyn2 expression constructs used have been described pre - viously : 1 ) wild - type Dyn2 aa splice variant ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) ; 2 ) wild - type Dyn2 ( aa ) - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) chimera , Dyn2 ( aa ) - GFP ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) ; 3 ) Dyn2 - GFP chimera carrying an inactivating point mutation in the nucleotide binding site , Dyn2 ( aa ) K44A - GFP ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) ; and 4 ) Dyn2 - GFP chimera lacking the PRD Dyn2 ( aa ) (cid:1) PRD - GFP ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) . The anti - dynamin peptide antibodies MC63 ( to the conserved NH 2 - amino terminus of dynamin ) and Dyn 2 ( to the dynamin 2 proline - rich tail ) have been described previously ( Cook et al . , 1994 ; Henley and McNiven , 1996 ) . Anti - phosphotyrosine and anti - cortactin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech - nology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) , and Upstate Biotechnology ( Lake Placid , NY ) , respectively . Polyclonal anti - giantin antibodies were a gener - ous gift of Dr . M . A . De Matteis ( Consorzio Mario Negri Sud , S . Maria Imbaro , Italy ) . Rab5 and Grb2 expression constructs were generous gifts of Drs . Cecilia Bucci ( “Federico II” University , Na - ples , Italy ) and Larry Samelson ( National Institutes of Health , Be - thesda , MD ) , respectively . Transfection Cells were plated at 50 % conﬂuence , and the next day they were incubated 1 h at 37°C with 0 . 45 (cid:1) g / cm 2 DNA of interest and 2 (cid:1) l / (cid:1) g DNA TransFast ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . Complete medium was then added . Experiments involving overexpression of exoge - nous proteins were usually performed 24 h after transfection . ECM Degradation Assay Fluorescent matrix - coated coverslips were prepared and the assay carried out as described previously ( Mueller and Chen , 1991 ; Muel - ler et al . , 1992 ; Bowden et al . , 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , thin layers of ﬂuoresce - in - , rhodamine B - ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) or Alexa 546 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) - conjugated gelatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were placed on coverslips , cross - linked with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 15 min at 0°C , and incubated for 3 min at room temperature with 5 mg / ml NaBH 4 . Finally , after a wash and a short 10 - min incubation in 70 % ethanol , coverslips were quenched with complete DMEM / F - 12 ( 1 : 1 ) ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum for 1 h a 37°C before cell plating . Cells were then cultured on ECM - coated coverslips over periods ranging from 2 to 15 h , de - pending on the experiment . Immunoﬂuorescence and Quantiﬁcation of ECM Degradation After treatments , cells were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min , permeabilized in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0 . 02 % saponin , 0 . 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , and 50 mM NH 4 Cl , incubated with primary antibodies of interest or phalloidin - tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate ( TRITC ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h and then incubated with ﬂuorophore - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) for 45 min . Finally , coverslips were mounted in the antifade reagent SlowFade ( Molecular Probes ) . All experiments were observed using an LSM 510 laser scanning con - focal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . Immunoﬂuorescence images were acquired at high confocality ( pinhole (cid:2) 1 Airy unit ) to achieve the thinnest possible optical slices at the substrate – cell interface . To determine the number of degrading cells for each experiment we considered 100 random ﬁelds ( containing at least 50 transfected cells ) at a 63 (cid:3) magniﬁcation . Values were then ex - pressed as the percentage of transfected cells that presented at least one degradation patch ( irrespective of extension ) relative to the total number of cells analyzed . To determine , instead , areas of degrada - tion we used the same criteria to select cells , and the area of each degradation patch was measured using the LSM 510 software to - gether with an electronic spreadsheet . The total area for each con - dition was then normalized for cell number and expressed as a percentage of control . Experiments were repeated at least three times . Dynamin Regulates Extracellular Matrix Degradation Vol . 14 , March 2003 1075 Correlative Light - Electron Microscopy ( CLEM ) CLEM was carried out on invadopodia by using a recently de - scribed protocol ( Polishchuk et al . , 2000 ; Polishchuk and Mironov , 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , A375 cells transfected with wild - type or mutant Dyn2 ( aa ) - GFP were grown on CELLocate coverslips ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) coated with ﬂuorescent gelatin , and , after appropriate times , were ﬁxed with 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde plus 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 2 M HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 5 min , and then with 4 % paraformaldehyde in the same buffer for 30 min . Next , cells were incubated in 0 . 02 % saponin - containing blocking solution ( PBS sup - plemented with 0 . 2 % BSA and 50 mM NH 4 Cl ) ; after washing , samples were analyzed under the confocal microscope and the cell bearing the structure of interest was localized within the grid coor - dinates . Samples were then processed for conventional electron microscopy ( EM ) with 1 % OsO 4 plus 1 . 5 % potassium ferrocyanide in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 3 ) for 2 h on ice ( all incubations before this step were performed at room temperature ) in the dark , and then dehydrated , embedded in epoxy resin , and polymerized for at least 24 h . CELLocate coverslips were then dissolved with 40 % hydroﬂuoric acid , and samples were extensively washed with buffer . Finally , serial sections of the cell of interest were produced parallel to the substrate . One hundred - nanometer serial sections were collected on slot grids covered with formvar - carbon support - ing ﬁlm and examined at 80 kV in a 109 electron microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) . The images collected by confocal microscopy and EM were aligned with Adobe Photoshop , and the structure of interest was identiﬁed on the basis of its position in space . Correlative Immunoelectron Microscopy A375 cells transfected with wild - type or mutant Dyn2 ( aa ) - GFP fusion proteins were grown on CELLocate coverslips , and , after appropriate times , were ﬁxed for electron microscopy as de - scribed above . Samples were analyzed under the confocal micro - scope and the cell bearing the structure of interest was localized within the grid coordinates . Next , cells were incubated in 0 . 02 % saponin - containing blocking solution ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 2 % BSA and 50 mM NH 4 Cl ) and then 2 h with anti - GFP antibody ( Abcam , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) , extensively washed , and revealed with Goldenhance - EM ( Nanoprobes , Stony Brook , NY ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Samples were then processed for conventional EM as described above . The images collected by confocal microscopy and EM were aligned and analyzed as described above . RESULTS To study the morphogenesis of invadopodia , we chose to use an invasive and highly metastatic clone of an estab - lished human melanoma cell line , A375MM ( Ayala et al . , 1999 ) . Invadopodia were visualized as described previ - ously by culturing cells on a cross - linked ﬂuorophore - conjugated gelatin matrix ( Mueller and Chen , 1991 ; Muel - ler et al . , 1992 ; Bowden et al . , 2001 ) . This ECM layer is very Figure 1 . ECM degradation by A375MM cells and effects of dom - inant negative dynamin 2 mu - tants and cyclosporin A on ECM degradation . A375MM melanoma cells were plated on cross - linked ﬂuorophore - conjugated matrix for 15 h , ﬁxed , stained with anti - giantin antibodies to label the Golgi complex , and analyzed at the confocal microscope . A sub - strate level optical section shows the dark areas of degradation ( A ) , the Golgi complex ( B ) , and their relative positions in the merge ( C ) . A375MM cells transiently transfected with wtDyn2aa - GFP , Dyn2 ( aa ) K44A - GFP ( D ) , or Dyn2 ( aa ) (cid:1) PRD - GFP ( E ) were cul - tured as described above and ﬁxed . The percentage of degrad - ing cells ( F ) and the areas of deg - radation ( G ) in nontransfected ( NT ) , wild - type - , and mutant - transfected samples were quanti - ﬁed as described in Experimental Procedures Cell contours have been digitally rendered in the mi - crographs .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 1076 stable , insoluble , and resistant to bland proteolysis such that only aggressively invasive protease - secreting cells are able to attack it , causing the formation of dark ( i . e . , nonﬂuorescent ) areas of degradation that can be counted and quantiﬁed . In a typical experiment , up to 60 % of A375MM melanoma cells efﬁciently degrade this matrix and display a characteristic pat - tern of degradation that consists , depending on the time of incubation , of clusters of 2 - 3 - 15 - 16 degradation patches ( Figure 1 ) , generally immediately close to the Golgi complex and often ( 25 % of cases ) directly below it ( Figure 1 ) . With increasing incubation times , the degradation patches tend to become larger , coalescing into larger ones as degradation progresses . The metalloprotease - speciﬁc broad - spectrum inhibitor BB - 94 ( ineffective on other proteases ; Davies et al . , 1993 ) completely inhibited the appearance of degradation patches ( our unpub - lished data ) , indicating that ECM degradation by A375MM cells was totally metalloprotease dependent . Although in A375MM cells we could detect the ﬁrst degradation events as early as 2 h after plating , most of the experiments that follow refer to 15 - h incubation . Inhibition of Dynamin 2 Suppresses Focal ECM Degradation To determine whether Dyn2 plays a functional role in the degradative process we followed two independent strategies . The ﬁrst was to directly exploit two different mutations of Dyn2 previously shown to act in a dominant negative manner : 1 ) the K44A point mutation in the nucleotide binding site , which impairs guanine nucleotide binding capability ( Hersko - vits et al . , 1993 ) ; and 2 ) the PRD deletion ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) , unable to bind SH3 - containing proteins . Strikingly , transient overexpression of the dominant negative Dyn2 mutants , Dyn2 ( aa ) K44A - GFP and Dyn2 ( aa ) (cid:1) PRD - GFP , substantially de - creased both the number of degrading cells and the total area of degradation ( Figure 1 ) . As a control , when the GFP chimera of the wild - type Dyn2 aa splice variant ( wtDyn2aa ; GenBank sequence B53165 ) was transiently overexpressed , both ECM degradation activity , expressed in terms of number of degrad - ing cells and area of degradation , and the general appearance of cells were similar to untransfected cells ( Figure 1 ) . The second approach was a pharmacological one based on the fact that the neuron - speciﬁc dynamin 1 , binds to ( Lai et al . , 1999 ) and is a substrate of , the calcium - dependent protein phospha - tase calcineurin . Dephosphorylation of dynamin 1 by cal - cineurin decreases its GTPase activity ( Liu et al . , 1994 ) and enhances interaction with its partners ( Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ) . When we tested the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A ( CsA ) in A375MM cells , we found it to dramatically decrease both the number of degrading cells and the total area of deg - radation ( Figure 1 ) . Figure 2 . Localization of dy - namin 2 and invadopodia mark - ers to EDS . A375MM melanoma cells were plated on cross - linked ﬂuorophore - conjugated matrix for 15 h , and then ﬁxed , stained with anti - dynamin ( Dyn2 - ab ) , an - ti - cortactin , or anti - phosphoty - rosine antibodies or phalloidin - TRITC and analyzed at the confocal microscope . ECM degra - dation patches ( A , D , and G , ar - rows ) from substrate level optical sections clearly coincided with ei - ther cortactin ( B ) , actin ( E ) , or phosphotyrosine ( H ) and a rein - forcement of the Dyn2 signal ( C , F , and I ) . Bar , 10 (cid:1) m . Dynamin Regulates Extracellular Matrix Degradation Vol . 14 , March 2003 1077 Localization of Wild - Type and Mutant Dyn2 We proceeded to determine whether Dyn2 was localized to invadopodia at areas of degradation by using two different peptide antibodies against dynamin ( MC63 - ab to the con - served NH 2 - amino terminus and Dyn2 - ab to the dynamin 2 proline - rich tail ) . A typical array of proteins localize to these areas , among which are cortactin , tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins , and actin ( Figure 2 ) . Hence , for practical purposes , the operational deﬁnition of invadopodia at the light micros - copy level is the colocalization of a series of proteins ( e . g . , . actin , cortactin , and tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins ) at sites of degradation ( Bowden et al . , 2001 ) . When the local - ization of Dyn2 was examined , we found a marked concen - tration of Dyn2 in colocalization with cortactin , actin , and tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins at areas of degradation in A375MM cells ( Figure 2 ) . Thus , dynamin clearly localizes to the invadopodia . The same was observed in wild - type Dyn2 - GFP – transfected cells ( Figure 3 ) . In contrast , the Dyn2 mutants exhibited a very altered distribution . Dyn2 (cid:1) PRD - GFP displayed a completely diffuse staining pattern ( Figure 3 ) , as expected ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) . Strikingly , in the few Dyn2 (cid:1) PRD - GFP – expressing cells with recognizable inva - dopodia - like staining , endogenous Dyn2 was found to be localized at the rare remaining sites of degradation ; this was determined through the use of the Dyn2 - ab antibody di - rected toward the proline - rich domain of dynamin ( thus unable to recognize transfected Dyn2 (cid:1) PRD - GFP ; our unpub - lished data ) . Thus , ECM degradation clearly correlated with the presence of endogenous ( functional ) dynamin . Dyn2 K44A - GFP , instead , appeared in numerous discrete puncta of ﬂuorescence ( Figure 3 ) much smaller than those observed in the wt - transfected cells and uniformly distributed throughout the entire surface of the plasma membrane . This was clearly at variance with control cells , where Dyn2 - positive structures were only present at the ventral surface and usually clustered in groups at sites of ECM degradation ( Figure 3 ) . To determine , however , whether in Dyn2 K44A - GFP – transfected cells invadopodial structures were formed but unable to de - grade the ECM , we studied the distribution of other markers in combination with Dyn2 K44A . As a result , a very limited num - ber of the numerous Dyn2 K44A - positive puncta seemed to co - localize with either actin ( Figure 3 ) , cortactin , or tyrosine - phos - phorylated proteins ( our unpublished data ) , suggesting that invadopodial structures were not formed . Ultrastructure of Dynamin - containing EDS A detailed ultrastructural analysis of the cell structures as - sociated to the areas of degradation ( tentatively called ECM - Figure 3 . Effects of dominant negative dynamin 2 mutants on EDS . A375MM cells transiently transfected with wtDyn2aa - GFP ( A – C ) , Dyn2 ( aa ) (cid:1) PRD - GFP ( D – F ) , or Dyn2 ( aa ) K44A - GFP ( G – I ) were cultured as described above , ﬁxed , stained with anti - phalloi - din - TRITC , and analyzed at the confocal microscope . Substrate level optical sections show the ﬂuorescent matrix ( A , D , and G ) , actin staining ( B , E , and H ) , and the GFP signal ( C , F , and I ) . Bar , 10 (cid:1) m . M . Baldassarre et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1078 degradation structures ; EDSs ) was necessary to deﬁne the mode of action of dynamin and to map its location within them . To this end , we used a correlative confocal light electron microscopy ( CLEM ) approach developed in our laboratory ( Polishchuk et al . , 2000 ) and by which individual objects can be analyzed both at the optical microscopic level and at the electron microscope . We transfected A375MM cells with wtDyn2aa - GFP and analyzed speciﬁc ﬂuorescent EDS at the EM ( Figure 4 and associated EM serial section series ; serial . mov ) . Serial ultrathin sections were then pro - duced , revealing the EDS to be a profound invagination of the ventral surface of the plasma membrane . Within the area delimited by the large invagination , large fragments of gel - atin could often be seen ( Figure 4 and associated movie of the confocal Z - stack series ; stack . mov ) . In general , such in - vaginations averaged 8 (cid:1) m in width and 2 (cid:1) m in depth . A common , prominent feature was the many surface protru - sions with diameters , ranging from hundreds of nanometers to a few micrometers , and averaging 500 nm in length , originating from various sites and that sometimes penetrate into the matrix ( Figure 4 ) . These protrusions are consistent with the reported “invading” structures originally described for invadopodia ( Chen , 1989 ) , but seemed to be part of a more complex superstructure . We next deﬁned the localiza - tion of Dyn2 within these structures by correlative im - muno - EM of wtDyn2 - GFP – expressing cells using anti - GFP antibodies ( Figure 4 ) . Dynamin labeling was clearly concen - trated in most invadopodial protrusions and within these , apparently not on the plasma membrane , suggesting asso - ciation to cytosolic structures . In summary , the EDS are profound invaginations of the ventral surface of the plasma membrane ﬁlled with fragments of partially degraded ECM and from which a number of Dyn2 - associated protrusions ( invadopodia ) originate contacting and locally degrading the ECM as exempliﬁed in the drawing in Figure 4 . In agreement with the results obtained through the use of confocal microscopy , the Golgi complex consistently oc - curred to be in close spatial relationship with the EDS ( our unpublished data ) . To deﬁne the effects of mutant Dyn2 expression , we extended our ultrastructural analysis to the mutant Dyn2 - expressing cells . As demonstrated above , Dyn2 (cid:1) PRD - GFP displayed a completely diffuse staining pat - tern ( Figure 3 ) . When examined at the EM level , the Dyn2 (cid:1) PRD - GFP – expressing cells did not feature structures recognizable as EDS , consistent with the diffuse staining of Dyn2 at the optical microscope level and the lack of detect - able ECM degradation ( Figure 4 ) . Dyn2 K44A - GFP – express - ing cells , instead , displayed a number of Dyn2 K44A - positive puncta . However ( see above ) , when we examined their ul - trastructure we found them to be simple membrane pits ( 0 . 5 – 1 (cid:1) m in width and 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 (cid:1) m in depth ) with no evi - dence of either gelatin fragments or of invadopodial protru - sions ( Figure 4 ) . Dynamics of Invadopodia We next determined the dynamics of invadopodia organized into EDS and actively engaged in ECM degradation ( as detect - able by the presence of dark patches on the ﬂuorescent sub - strate ) by imaging Dyn2 - GFP – transfected cells with time - lapse confocal microscopy to determine the appearance and posi - tioning of EDS ( relative to the area of degradation ) in time . The results clearly indicated that the Dyn2 - labeled EDS was stable both in appearance and positioning over a long period ( up to 50 min ; our unpublished data ) . Next , to assess the molecular dynamics of Dyn2 at sites of degradation , we determined the turnover of Dyn2 - GFP at EDS , by measuring ﬂuorescence re - covery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and found that ﬂuores - cence recovered very rapidly with a t 1 / 2 of only 10 s after bleaching ( Figure 5 ) . DISCUSSION We report herein that both the enzymic activity and the proper localization of the large GTPase dynamin 2 are necessary for focalized ECM degradation by invasive tumor cells . The ECM - degrading plasma membrane protrusions , invadopodia , were found to originate , and be organized into , a novel EDS consist - ing of a large invagination of the ventral plasma membrane surface in close spatial relationship with the Golgi complex . Dyn2 seemed to be markedly enriched within the surface pro - trusions and apparently not associated to the plasma mem - brane . Hence , Dyn2 seems to regulate focal matrix degradation coordinating the organization and function of these novel ma - trix degradation structures . Our ﬁndings indicate that both the GTPase activity and proper localization of Dyn2 are necessary for the organiza - tion of EDS - associated structures and ultimately for ECM degradation . It is well established that the proline - rich do - main of dynamin binds a variety of SH3 domain - containing proteins proposed to mediate and / or regulate dynamin function . Thus , although the dominant negative behavior of Dyn2 (cid:1) PRD - GFP suggests that the proline - rich domain of Dyn2 is necessary for proper localization , i . e . , via cortactin or other actin - binding protein ( s ) , it also implies that some other Dyn2 domain ( s ) mediates interaction with another partner protein ( s ) essential for invadopodia function . Be - cause the dynamin mutants used in this study also inhibit endocytosis ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) , we wondered whether their effect on ECM degradation at EDS might be due to a block of endocytosis . A number of direct and indirect indi - cations rule out this possibility : 1 ) Typical endocytosis mark - ers ( e . g . , transferrin receptor , internalized transferrin , and ﬂuorophore - conjugated dextran ) seemed to be excluded from the invadopodial area ( our unpublished data ) . 2 ) The small G - protein Rab 5 has been shown to be an essential regulator of early endocytic events and expression of dom - inant negative ( i . e . , GDP - bound ) and positive ( GTP - bound ) mutants interfere with both early endosome formation and fusion ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ) . Transient transfection of dominant inactive and active Rab 5 mutants in A375MM cells pro - duced the expected aberrant phenotypes but had no effect on ECM degradation at sites of invasion ( our unpublished data ) . 3 ) Grb2 , an adaptor protein known to couple receptors to intracellular signaling pathways , has been proposed to be required for a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway me - diating epidermal growth factor receptor internalization ( Yamazaki et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , Grb 2 constructs containing inhibitory mutations in either of the two SH3 domains have been shown to prevent internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( Yamazaki et al . , 2002 ) . In our exper - iments , transient transfection of the same mutants did not affect ECM degradation at sites of invasion ( our unpublished data ) . 4 ) Our correlative immunoelectron microscopy anal - ysis clearly localized Dyn2 to the cytoplasmic area within Dynamin Regulates Extracellular Matrix Degradation Vol . 14 , March 2003 1079 Figure 4 . M . Baldassarre et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1080 the invadopodial protrusions , inconsistent with the localiza - tion and proposed mechanism of action of Dyn2 in endocy - tosis . 5 ) The phosphoinositide 3 - kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin , known to perturb various steps of endo - cytic trafﬁcking ( reviewed in Backer , 2000 ) have no effect on ECM degradation at invadopodia ( our unpublished data ) . and 6 ) Cyclosporin A does not signiﬁcantly perturb endo - cytosis in nonneuronal cells ( Yasutomi et al . , 1992 ; Artalejo et al . , 1996 ) . Taken together , these observations suggest that the role of Dyn2 in ECM degradation is not related to its func - tion in endocytosis . Finally , another theoretical possibility is that inhibition of dynamin function affects the intracellular transport and secretion of MMPs , because Dyn2 has also been shown to play a role in export from the Golgi complex ( Cao et al . , 2000 ) . Although this explanation cannot be for - mally ruled out at present , it is difﬁcult to reconcile , how - ever , with the dramatic effects of mutant dynamin on the structure and composition of EDS . On the basis of the above - mentioned indications , we favor the hypothesis that dynamin plays a direct role in control - ling and maintaining the structure / function of the large actin - based structure where ECM degradation takes place . This is in line with a previous report suggesting a role for cortactin in ECM degradation at invadopodia ( see below ; Bowden et al . , 1999 ) and with the recent ﬁnding that the actin nucleation regulator Neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome pro - tein is localized to , and is necessary for , invadopodia func - tion ( Mizutani et al . , 2002 ) . Possibly , this occurs via one or more of the actin - regulating partners of dynamin 2 . In fact , as introduced above , the dynamins are multidomain pro - teins featuring , among others , a C - terminal PRD , which binds a variety of SH3 - containing proteins . Notably , among these are the actin - binding / - regulating proteins mABP1 , syndapin , cortactin , and proﬁlin ( Witke et al . , 1998 ; Qual - mann et al . , 1999 ; McNiven et al . , 2000b ; Kessels et al . , 2001 ) . For example , a candidate in mediating Dyn2 function at the EDS might be cortactin , a tyrosine - phosphorylated cortical actin - binding protein proposed to play a role in tumor cell invasion ( reviewed in Weed and Parsons , 2001 ) , and also known to 1 ) mediate the regulatory function of dynamin on actin in membrane rufﬂing ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) , and 2 ) be localized to , and required for , ECM degradation at inva - dopodia ( Bowden et al . , 1999 ) . Interestingly , dynamin is also the target of multiple regulatory inputs such as protein kinase C ( Powell et al . , 2000 ) , phosphoinositides ( Lee et al . , 1999 ; Vallis et al . , 1999 ; Muhlberg and Schmid , 2000 ) , and calcineurin ( Liu et al . , 1994 ; Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ) . Thus , dynamin and its interacting partners are possible mo - lecular targets for the development of antiinvasive agents . The neuron - speciﬁc dynamin 1 binds to ( Lai et al . , 1999 ) and is a substrate of the calcium - dependent protein phos - phatase calcineurin . Dephosphorylation of dynamin 1 by calcineurin decreases its GTPase activity ( Liu et al . , 1994 ) and enhances interaction with its partners ( Slepnev and De Ca - milli , 2000 ) . The immunosuppressants CsA and Tacrolimus ( FK506 ) are calcineurin inhibitors reported to inhibit synap - tic vesicle recycling , a dynamin 1 - controlled event ( Marks and McMahon , 1998 ) and to interfere with podosome orga - nization ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) . We found CsA to dramatically decrease both the number of degrading cells and the total area of degradation . Interestingly , CsA and Tacrolimus have been reported to decrease bone resorption in vitro by rat osteoclasts ( Dempster et al . , 1987 ) , via inhibition of cal - Figure 4 ( facing page ) .

The function of osteoclasts in bone resorption is mediated by focal matrix degradation . Hence , these ﬁndings together with our observations can be interpreted as suggesting an inhibitory effect of CsA on ECM degradation . An interesting clinical correlate of these ﬁnd - ings arises from the observation that renal transplantation recipients treated with CsA alone show an increase in bone mineral density after 18 mo ( Ponticelli and Aroldi , 2001 ) . Other actin - driven cellular structures / events shown to be regulated by Dyn2 are phagocytosis ( Gold et al . , 1999 ) , mem - brane remodeling ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) , actin comet move - ment ( Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) , and the formation of the above - mentioned podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , dynamic plasma membrane protrusions characterized in nontumoral phagocytic cells or virus - transformed cells , and thought to be involved in mediating transient attach - ment during locomotion . The similarity in molecular com - position between podosomes and invadopodia is remark - able and , in this regard , it is interesting to note that invadopodia have been initially characterized in Src - trans - formed cells cultured on a degradable ECM substrate and termed “invading podosomes” ( Chen , 1989 ) . There are , however , a number of fundamental differences between po - dosomes and invadopodia at both the morphological and functional levels that need to be considered . First , although podosomes have been described to be tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane associated with columnar arrays of actin ( Nitsch et al . , 1989 ; Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , our CLEM ultrastructural analysis reveals that invadopodial protru - sions are organized into profound invaginations of the plasma membrane ( EDS ) without evidence of inward tubu - lations of the plasma membrane . Moreover , we observe that at EDS , Dyn2 is clearly localized to the cytoplasmic area within the invadopodial protrusions whereas in podosomes , Dyn2 has been proposed to be a component of the sheath surrounding the tubular invaginations of podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , although the lack of an ultrastructural localization of Dyn2 at podosomes renders a comparative analysis with our immunoelectron microscopy observations difﬁcult ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) . At the functional level , podo - somes have been consistently shown to be highly dynamic protrusive structures constantly forming and reforming within minutes . Although , similarly to podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , Dyn2 rapidly turns over with a half - life of (cid:4) 10 s at EDS , we observe instead , that at EDS , invadopodia engaged in active ECM degradation ( as suggested by the underlying degradation patches ) are immobile over a long period . Fi - nally , expression of Dyn2 K44A - GFP was not observed to affect the organization of podosomes ( as observed at the optical level ; Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , but did disrupt invadopodia and block ECM degradation in our experiments . Finally , the highly invasive A375 human melanoma cells used in this study , form EDS and associated invadopodia only when grown on extracellular matrix proteins ( our unpublished data ) and do not form the podosome - like structures on glass or serum - coated surfaces . This is not surprising since the induction of functional invadopodia ( i . e . , associated to ECM degradation ) is related to the activation of tightly regulated integrin - mediated signaling events ( Coopman et al . , 1996 ; Nakahara et al . , 1998 ) . Considering all the above - mentioned information and that they have been detected only in cells with at least the potential ability to degrade ECM , podo - somes might represent vestigial or initial structures that in the appropriate conditions differentiate into the ECM deg - radation - competent , stable structures described herein . These aspects need to be investigated further because a wealth of information on podosomes is available that could be related to the biogenesis and function of invadopodia . As a ﬁnal remark , invadopodia seem to be a powerful experi - mental paradigm to study the dynamic interrelationships between membrane transport , cytoskeleton regulation , and cell invasion through the ECM .
