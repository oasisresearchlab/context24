These structures form from complex nanoscale building blocks and with remarkable reproducibility making biological self - assembly an attractive processing route in a variety of applica - tions . DNA , 1 , 2 virus - like particles , 3 – 5 bacterial membranes , 6 , 7 and proteins 8 – 10 show promise as biotemplates to synthesize and organize inorganic materials at the nanoscale . An understanding of the principles that govern complex biological self - assembly pathways will lead to predictive control and enhanced utility of self - assembled biomolecules in nanoscale applications . Clathrin is a protein with three legs of about 50 nm in length that meet at a central vertex , forming a triskelion structure . 11 Clathrin self - associates to form a variety of structures . While the exact molecular - level details are as yet unknown , this self - assembly is stabilized by multiple weak leg – leg interactions . 12 In its natural environment inside a cell , clathrin plays a key role in the dynamic reshaping of the cell membrane during endocy - tosis . 11 The individual triskelia localize at the lipid membrane and dynamically organize to create curved pits that pinch o ﬀ to form spherical cages around lipid vesicles . The clathrin then disassembles and recycles back to the membrane to begin the process again . The highly dynamic nature of the assembly process makes clathrin an attractive model system to study the kinetic and thermodynamic principles of biological self - assembly . Central to the ability to robustly form ordered self - assembled structures is the capability to overcome local energetic minima that arise during the assembly process . Although strong speci  c interactions can be used to achieve self - assembly of speci  c tailored structures , this design strategy can lead to kinetically trapped irregular structures that are incapable of reorganizing on experimentally realizable timescales . Alternatively , the prevalence of speci  c interactions that are weak and reversible allows dynamic reorganization , which may enable the system to explore a wider variety of geometric con  gurations thereby improving the probability that the thermodynamically desired structure will be formed . In addition , self - assembling molecules in nature , such as clathrin , may combine local and speci  c order - determining interactions with delocalized , non - speci  c attraction and repulsion to achieve robust assembly .

View Article Online View Journal | View Issue experimental and computational approaches to systematically study the formation of the most commonly observed in vitro clathrin assembly , spherical cages . Dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) is used in combination with cryo transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) to assess time dependent clathrin self - assembly for various environmental pH , which tunes the surface charge and hydrophobicity of the protein . We have previously developed a detailed , mesoscale theoretical model of clathrin at a 2D surface . 13 Here we extend this model to 3D and use it in Brownian dynamics simulations to study the e ﬀ ects of competing non - speci  c and speci  c reversible interactions on clathrin self - assembly and remodeling in solution . Our studies demonstrate that at least two distinct kinetic routes of self - assembly exist for clathrin , both resulting in similar spherical cage architectures . The timescale of assembly is dictated by the relative strengths of non - speci  c and speci  c interactions , which are tuned by pH manipulation . These results provide insight into biological mechanisms of dynamic self - assembly and provide guidance in the future design of engineered self - assembly systems . 2 Results Clathrin protein is isolated from bovine brain tissue using di ﬀ erential centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography as previously reported . 14 Puri  ed clathrin triskelia are induced to self - assemble in 100 mM 2 - morpholinoethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) with pH values between 5 . 1 and 6 . 9 and monitored in situ by DLS . The DLS size distribution data indicate three main states of clathrin assembly ( Fig . 1 ) . Based on TEM analysis of the protein solutions , we attribute these three states to di ﬀ erent discrete structures : monomeric clathrin , assembled cages , and disordered aggregates ( Fig . 1a – c , respectively ) . In addition , certain solutions exhibit multiple peaks within the light scat - tering traces , which is consistent with a mixture of species that might occur during a dynamic self - assembly process ( Fig . 1d ) . To investigate the kinetics of self - assembly , clathrin assembly reactions are monitored by DLS over 20 minutes with measurements every minute . Taking measurements a  er 1 day and 5 days assesses long - term stability of the assembled struc - tures . In the  rst 20 minutes of assembly the process is highly dynamic ; size distribution peaks are broad and multiple peaks are seen o  en . The peaks a  er 1 day are signi  cantly sharper , indicating a narrower size distribution of structures in solution ( Fig . 2a ) . We examine pH - dependent trends by plotting the size of the dominant peak to identify the major species and its evolution with time ( Fig . 2b ) . The data indicate two distinct kinetic routes of self - assembly . At pH values below the isoelec - tric point ( IEP ) of clathrin , pH 5 . 8 , 15 the protein quickly aggre - gates in solution and subsequently adopts a cage - like signature in the DLS data . In contrast , at pH values above the IEP , the assembly proceeds monotonically from monomer to cage . At a pH near the IEP , where the net charge of the protein is near zero , cage structures form monotonically but are unstable and aggregate over time . These data suggest that surface charge plays an important role in regulating dynamic self - assembly and reorganization of discrete structures and disordered aggregates . However while the IEP strictly describes net surface Fig . 1 Representativehydrodynamic - radius distributions fromDLS ( left ) , representativeTEMimages ( middle ) , and representative simulations ( right ) ofclathrinprotein solutions containing ( a ) monomers , ( b ) assembled cages , ( c ) disordered aggregates , and ( d ) a mixture of assembled cages and disordered aggregates . 9138 | Soft Matter , 2013 , 9 , 9137 – 9145 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Soft Matter Paper P ub li s h e d on 30 M a y 2013 .

View Article Online charge , a reduction in pH also increases clathrin hydropho - bicity , 16 so we are not able to attribute these e ﬀ ects exclusively to changes in surface charge . Next , cryo TEM is used to examine the structures that form along the two distinct kinetic pathways above ( pH 6 . 0 ) and below ( pH 5 . 1 ) the IEP . A  er 20 minutes of assembly , spherical cages are observed in the sample at pH 6 . 0 , as expected from the presence of a small broad peak near 100 nm in the DLS data ( Fig . 3a ) . These structures are stable and still observable a  er 4 days ( Fig . 3c ) . Individual cages appear to have subtle di ﬀ erences in size , which is consistent with the observed heterogeneity of clathrin structures that arise within a cell during endocytosis . 11 Similar heterogeneity has been documented experimentally in other biological self - assembly systems such as viral capsid structures . 17 In contrast , large disordered aggregates are observed in the sample held at pH 5 . 1 for 20 minutes , corresponding to the presence of a peak between 400 and 500 nm in the DLS data ( Fig . 3b ) . A  er 4 days , these same pH 5 . 1 samples exhibit formation of ordered spherical cage structures , consistent with the observed DLS peak shi  at longer times ( Fig . 3d ) . These data demonstrate that large scale remodeling of the clathrin aggregates occurs over time , resulting in  nal structures that are similar in size and shape to the cages that grow monotonically at higher pH ( Fig . 3e ) . Therefore , both kinetic routes of assembly ultimately result in similar  nal assembled states , suggesting that the mechanism of clathrin assembly has evolved to achieve robustness . This apparent robustness of assembly into cage - like structures may be an essential feature for clathrin to perform critical functions in a wide range of organisms . 18 Brownian dynamics simulations provide insight into the mechanisms that drive assembly through the various experi - mentally observed pathways . Our simpli  ed model for this self - assembly process treats the individual triskelia as three - legged pinwheels , whose deformation energies are described by harmonic terms that resist stretching and twisting of bonds , as well as the distortion of the angles at which the legs emanate from the central hub . Any unbound legs are assumed to adopt a Fig . 2 ( a ) Kymographs of DLS data showing change in hydrodynamic radius distribution over time for a range of pH values .

View Article Online minimum energy con  guration , so elastic strain on our clathrin assemblies only results from translocation and rotation of hubs that are bound to others . In this way , the state of the system is fully de  ned by the location and orientation of the triskelion hubs . This formulation enables us to simulate timescales that allow for many clathrin binding and aggregation events in a system of several hundred triskelia , which would not be possible had our model included atomistic detail of this large , 650 kDa protein complex . Our model triskelia interact with one another through both non - speci  c and speci  c interactions . An unbound triskelion leg can form a speci  c bond with an unbound leg of another triskelion , resulting in an energetic bene  t of (cid:2) 3 . The K d for this interaction has been reported to be (cid:3) 100 m M ( i . e . (cid:3) 10 k B T ) . 12 The a ﬃ nity 3 is set to 15 k B T for all of our simulations which results in closed cage formation on the timescale of the simu - lations . The triskelia interact non - speci  cally through a Len - nard - Jones potential , given by E LJ ; ij ¼ n 0 " (cid:2) s r ij (cid:3) 12 (cid:2) 2 (cid:2) s r ij (cid:3) 6 # ( 1 ) where r ij is the separation distance between the i th hub and the j th hub , s is the value of r ij that minimizes E LJ ( i . e . , the distance at which non - speci  c interactions are most favorable ) , and n 0 is the potential well depth ( i . e . , the strength of non - speci  c interactions ) . By changing the value of n 0 in our model , we are able to observe the e ﬀ ects of shi  ing the balance between speci  c and non - speci  c driving forces on clathrin self - assembly pathways . Altering the strength of non - speci  c interactions through n 0 results in starkly di ﬀ erent assembly pathways . Over short simulated timescales , systems with n 0 ¼ 1 k B T showed a tendency to aggregate into large disordered structures , while systems with n 0 ¼ 0 . 1 k B T assembled into well - de  ned cages . We scale our simulation time by the Brownian time step t B , which is the time required for a triskelion to one clathrin leg length on average . As shown by our simulation snapshots , at n 0 ¼ 0 . 1 k B T , a random spatial distribution of monomers ( with free legs identi  ed in green ) at t ¼ 0 bind to one another over time to form cage - like structures that are almost completely held together through speci  c leg – leg interactions ( Fig . 4a ) . This is in contrast to the dynamic aggregation of monomers into larger aggregated clusters in simulations that use n 0 ¼ 1 k B T ( Fig . 4b ) . We quantify the sizes of our simulated clathrin assemblies by calculating their hydrodynamic radii , R H ( Fig . 4c and d ) . These values are nearly identical to the assemblies ' radii of gyration . R H is obtained using two distinct de  nitions of “ cla - thrin clusters ” . When the cluster is de  ned as a structure con - nected through speci  c leg – leg interactions only , the hydrodynamic radii for both values of n 0 monotonically approach (cid:3) 50 nm over time . However , by de  ning a cluster based on the proximity of triskelion hubs ( i . e . , individual hubs are separated by less than 1 . 25 leg lengths regardless of speci  c bond formation ) , the R H behavior over time is di ﬀ erent between the two values of n 0 . In the simulation with weaker non - speci  c interactions ( n 0 ¼ 0 . 1 k B T ) , de  nition of cluster size has little impact on calculated R H . Both de  nitions lead to cluster sizes that appear to plateau over time to 50 – 60 nm , consistent with Fig . 4 ( a and b ) Representative snapshots of our simulations at exponentially spaced time points show the formation of ordered cages when n 0 ¼ 0 . 1 k B T ( a ) , and disordered aggregates when n 0 ¼ 1 k B T ( b ) .

The dots on each plot correspond to clusters de ﬁ ned by a group of triskelia that are speci ﬁ cally bound through leg – leg interactions , and the crosses correspond to clusters de ﬁ ned by triskelia whose hubs are separated by less than 1 . 25 leg lengths from at least one other triskelion hub in the cluster . 9140 | Soft Matter , 2013 , 9 , 9137 – 9145 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Soft Matter Paper P ub li s h e d on 30 M a y 2013 .

In contrast , increasing the strength of non - speci  c interactions ( n 0 ¼ 1 k B T ) predicts a steady growth of R H for clusters de  ned by hub proximity ( Fig . 4d ) . Already at the end of this simulation time , these clusters are 100 % larger than their speci  cally bound counterparts , and the value has not yet reached a plateau . The observed robust assembly behavior for speci  cally bound clusters is derived from the geometry of a clathrin triskelion . Leg length and pucker angle of the triskelion dictate the resulting cage size rather than interaction strength . We also observe this experimentally in both DLS and TEM which show that cage sizes are similar a  er assembly in di ﬀ erent pH conditions . These results suggest that geometrical require - ments for formation of speci  c bonds between legs play a signi  cant role in structure determination . It is also notable that the aggregates formed when n 0 ¼ 1 k B T consist of clumps of partial cage - like structures that individu - ally resemble the clusters in the early stages of simulations with n 0 ¼ 0 . 1 k B T . This behavior shows that the speci  c leg – leg interactions exert signi  cant control over short - time clathrin kinetic assembly , even when nonspeci  c interactions dictate the large - scale assembly patterns . 3 Discussion O  en during self - assembly processes , deviation from a single deterministic pathway leads to disordered aggregation and kinetic traps that are di ﬃ cult to exit . Classical nucleation and growth theory predicts a monotonic increase of cluster size once the critical nucleus size is overcome . Subsequent cluster growth can lead to secondary mechanisms of reorganization including coalescence and Ostwald ripening ; however , these secondary growth mechanisms would generally lead to the volume average cluster size increasing monotonically with time . The dynamics of cluster formation can exhibit non - monotonic behavior particularly in  nite - sized systems that exhibit kinetic inter - mediates that exhaust the solution of the fundamental subunits , and subsequent reorganization of these clusters can exhibit a decrease in cluster size . 19 Here , our solution phase assembly is not limited by the clathrin number yet exhibits non - monotonic behavior . DLS and cryo - TEM analysis of clathrin self - assembly suggests that in addition to following a mono - tonic growth pathway , clathrin is also able to achieve ordered nanostructures through a distinct pathway by remodeling large disordered aggregates . When aggregation occurs , the local concentration of clathrin increases dramatically . Therefore , the availability of speci  c binding sites is increased and the clathrin legs can readily  nd new binding partners if rearrangement of bonds is allowed . It is important to note that individual clathrin leg – leg interactions have been reported to be quite weak ; the K d has been reported to be on the order of 100 m M ( i . e . (cid:3) 10 k B T ) . 12 The free energy gain from this weak binding is likely not su ﬃ cient to drive rear - rangement of a single triskelion in a disordered aggregate ; however , weak binding would be necessary to allow bond motion in order to leave the kinetically frustrated aggregate state on experimentally realizable timescales . Previous work on modeling clathrin assembly in two dimensions shows that defects in an otherwise regular  at honeycomb lattice interact with each other over a very long distance which can cause them to attract one another and subsequently annihilate . 13 For closed three - dimensional struc - tures , the same long range elastic interaction between defects may not cause long - range attraction to occur ; however , weak reversible interactions between clathrin legs permit defects to di ﬀ use due to thermal reorganization . Because both non - speci  c and speci  c binding are weak , any interactions that do not satisfy the geometrical requirements for formation of a thermodynamically favorable spherical cage can be rearranged until a minimum elastic strain state is reached . Our computational modeling of three - dimensional assembly in solution implicates the strength of non - speci  c interactions between clathrin monomers as a determining factor of clathrin - structure size and order on short timescales . The large varia - tions in the structure sizes that we observe experimentally at di ﬀ erent solution conditions align with these predictions . Decreasing pH corresponds to an increase in non - speci  c interaction strength due to a number of simultaneous changes in the protein including changes in surface charge and hydro - phobicity . At pH above the IEP , clathrin carries a net negative charge resulting in a non - speci  c repulsion between mono - mers . However , if the short lengthscale speci  c interactions between legs can overcome this repulsion , this would lead to the observed cage formation behavior at higher pH . 12 At pH below the IEP , it has been shown that clathrin becomes increasingly hydrophobic . 16 This corresponds to the exact regime where our data indicate non - speci  c aggregation occurs . This increase in hydrophobicity likely creates an attractive force strong enough to counteract any electrostatic repulsion from the net positive surface charge , resulting in fast aggregation of clathrin mono - mers before speci  c associations can be formed . Our 3D simulations only represent very short timescales due to computational limitations , so we do not directly observe the modeled clathrin aggregates annealing into spherical cage - like structures . However , such behavior in our model system is fully expected to occur as the dynamic simulations slowly readjust the positions and connectedness of the clathrin structures to reduce the free energy of the system . In typical engineered self - assembling systems , non - speci  c attraction is usually avoided to prevent  occulation . We suggest that weak delocalized attraction may be used as a way to bring monomers together , provided a su ﬃ cient driving force for rearrangement into the proper geometry exists . This phenom - enon has been demonstrated before in a two - dimensional colloidal system where tuning of hydrophobic attraction along with geometrical constraints on binding sites led to the formation of a kagome lattice structure from disordered inter - mediates . 20 In a comparable two - dimensional protein system , collagen assembly on mica surfaces has been shown to be sensitive to the relative strength of non - speci  c collagen - mica interaction and speci  c collagen – collagen interaction , where geometrically ordered collagen bundling due to speci  c This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Soft Matter , 2013 , 9 , 9137 – 9145 | 9141 Paper Soft Matter P ub li s h e d on 30 M a y 2013 .

View Article Online interactions follows a dense disordered state mediated by non - speci  c attraction to the mica surface . 21 Additionally , two - dimensional S - layer protein assembly on supported lipid bila - yers has been shown to proceed via a dense amorphous state before crystallization , and the balance of speci  c and non - speci  c interactions has been shown to profoundly a ﬀ ect the assembly pathway . 22 , 23 We show that these principles also hold true when assembling protein in solution . Tuning the relative strengths of the non - speci  c and speci  c bonding can result in distinct kinetic pathways to the same nanoscale assembled structure . This implies that when designing biomimetic self - assembling systems , non - speci  c interactions can be used to promote a local increase in available binding sites while weak speci  c interactions are used to determine  nal order of the structure . 4 Conclusions We demonstrate that clathrin self - assembles into spherical cage structures via two kinetically distinct routes . One pathway involves monotonic growth of the cages mediated primarily by speci  c leg – leg interactions . The second pathway begins with disordered aggregation due to non - speci  c interactions fol - lowed by dynamic remodeling into discrete ordered cages as the more favorable speci  c leg – leg interactions are formed . These results suggest that in designing de novo self - assembling nanostructures , non - speci  c interactions , such as hydrophobic condensation , can be leveraged as additional parameters to achieve robust assembly , and use of multiple weak speci  c interactions will allow escape from disordered kinetically trap - ped species while still encoding a desired ordered structure . 5 Methods Clathrin puri  cation Bovine brain tissue is blended in an equal volume of HKM bu ﬀ er ( 25 mM HEPES , 125 mM potassium acetate , 5 mM magnesium acetate , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 ) , homogenized , and spun at 5750 (cid:4) g for 20 minutes . The supernatant is collected and spun at 43 000 (cid:4) g for 40 minutes . The pellets are resus - pended in HKM , mixed with an equal volume of 12 . 5 % w / v Ficoll and 12 . 5 % w / v sucrose in HKM , sonicated for 1 minute , and spun at 25 000 (cid:4) g for 20 minutes . The supernatant is collected , combined with 3 volumes of HKM , and spun at 35 000 (cid:4) g for 60 minutes . Each resulting pellet of clathrin - coated vesicles is resuspended in HKM for storage . For clathrin monomer isolation , vesicles are resuspended in dissociation bu ﬀ er ( 1 M Tris pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA ) then spun down at 22 000 (cid:4) g for 20 minutes before loading the supernatant onto a Sepharose CL - 4B gel  ltration column .

Scans are taken for 20 minutes at 1 - minute intervals , overnight , and 5 days later . Samples are stored capped and at room temperature . For the pH series , the assembly bu ﬀ ers are 1 M MES at pH 5 . 1 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 7 , 6 . 0 , 6 . 3 , 6 . 6 , or 6 . 9 . Cryo - TEM sample preparation and imaging Cryo - TEM grids are prepared using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV controlled environment vitri  cation system ( CEVS ) . A Quanti - foil holey carbon R2 / 4 200 mesh grid is glow discharged using a Harrick Plasma PDC - 32G for 30 s at 500 mtorr , low setting . 3 mL of sample is applied to the carbon side of the grid inside the CEVS chamber maintained at 22 (cid:5) C and 100 % relative humidity . A  er 5 – 10 s , excess sample is blotted for 3 s with blot force 9 using Whatman Grade 597  lter paper to form a thin  lm of sample .

Computational methods Our model of clathrin triskelia extends our previous two - dimensional work 13 to include the three - dimensional position and orientation of individual clathrin triskelia . We use a simpli  ed elastic representation , in which each triskelion is de  ned by a hub from which three legs emanate in a pinwheel con  guration . Unbound legs of nearby triskelia are capable of binding to one another , contributing an energetic bene  t of (cid:2) 3 , and bound legs are capable of unbinding with a corresponding energetic penalty . Our simulations use a value of 3 ¼ 15 k B T . A Brownian time step , t B , is de  ned as the time for which inde - pendent clathrin hubs di ﬀ use a distance equal to one leg length r 0 on average . We run our simulations for a total of 343 Brow - nian time steps . The state of our system is completely de  ned by the spatial locations of the hubs ~ r i , their normal vectors ~ n i , and the bond connectivity network , which is characterized by the link indicator L ij and the leg index indicator l ij . The link indi - cator L ij is equal to 1 when hubs i and j are bound to one another and equal to 0 otherwise . If L ij ¼ 1 , the leg index indicator l ij gives the index of the leg on hub i ( between 1 and 3 ) that connects hub j . If L ij ¼ 0 , the leg index indicator l ij ¼ 0 . When a triskelion is bound to other neighboring triskelia , the bound triskelia are deformable through four elastic modes , all of which obey a Hookean spring - like potential . These elastic modes include stretching of bound legs , twisting of bound legs , in - plane bending of legs away from their uniform radial distri - bution around the hub , and out - of - plane bending of legs away from their intrinsic pucker angle .

We use r 0 ¼ 20 nm , which roughly corresponds to previously measured lengths between vertices of reassembled clathrin cages ; 24 although , the edge length is also measured to be as small as 15 nm by some researchers . 25 The Lennard - Jones potential is characterized by the potential well depth n 0 and the distance of minimum non - speci  c energy s . All simulations use s ¼ r 0 , and we vary the value of n 0 . Elastic moduli for the stretching k s , twisting k t , in - plane bending k ipb , and out - of - plane bending k opb are equal to 67 k B T / r 02 , 58 k B T , 36 k B T and 36 k B T , respectively . These values are chosen to approximately correspond with the triskelia rigidities that are determined experimentally using leg - angle and leg - length distributions from electron micrographs . 26 , 27 The twisting energy is a function of the angle f ij , representing the misalignment of the normal vector components of hubs i and j that are orthogonal to their connecting bond . The calculated in - plane bending metric c i jk describes the contribution to the in - plane bending energy from the legs on hub i that are connected to hubs j and k . The value of c i jk depends on the binding state of the third leg of hub i . If the third leg of hub i is bound to another hub with index l ( i . e . l il is not zero ) , the in - plane bending energy is strictly given by the angle between hubs i , j , k , resulting in c ijk (cid:6) l ij ; l ik ; l il s 0 (cid:7) ¼ (cid:2) q l ij l ik jik (cid:2) 2 p 3 (cid:3) 2 ( 3 ) If the third leg of hub i is not bound to any other hub ( i . e . l il is zero for all l ) , then that leg is assumed to adopt a con  gura - tion that minimizes in - plane bending energy between it and the other two legs , such that c ijk (cid:6) l ij ; l ik ; l il ¼ 0 (cid:7) ¼ 3 2 (cid:2) q l ij l ik jik (cid:2) 2 p 3 (cid:3) 2 ( 4 ) The component of the angle between legs l i j and l i k on hub i that is orthogonal to hub i ' s normal vector ~ n i is given by q l ij l ik jik and is measured in the counterclockwise direction from leg 1 to leg 2 , leg 2 to leg 3 , or leg 3 to leg 1 . Out - of - plane elastic energy is dictated by the di ﬀ erence between the clathrin ' s intrinsic pucker angle a 0 and a i j , the angle between ~ n i and the tangent vector of hub i ' s leg that connects it to hub j . A combined Brownian dynamics and dynamic Monte Carlo simulation is used to predict the motion and binding processes of triskelia in solution . We simulate the behavior of 500 triskelia in a cubic , periodic box of edge length L ¼ 20 r 0 , using a 2 nd order Runge - Kutta routine . The data presented in this paper represents the average of 15 independent simulations for each di ﬀ erent set of parameters . Neglecting long - range hydrody - namic coupling between clathrin , we employ the following overdamped Langevin equations of motion to predict the dynamic behavior of ~ r i and ~ n i x t v ~ r i v t ¼ (cid:2) v E v ~ r i þ ~ B i ( 5 ) x r v ~ n i v t ¼ (cid:2) (cid:6) I (cid:2) ~ n i ~ n i (cid:7) $ v E v ~ n i þ ~ W i (cid:4) ~ n i ( 6 ) The translational and rotational drag coe ﬃ cients , x t and x r , balance the potential - driven force and torque as well as the Brownian ( i . e . thermal ) force and torque , ~ B i and ~ W i . The magnitudes of the thermal force and torque are chosen to obey the  uctuation – dissipation theorem D ~ B i ð t Þ ~ B j (cid:6) t 0 (cid:7)E ¼ 2 k B T x t d (cid:6) t (cid:2) t 0 (cid:7) d ij I ( 7 ) D ~ W i ð t Þ ~ W j (cid:6) t 0 (cid:7)E ¼ 2 k B T x r d (cid:6) t (cid:2) t 0 (cid:7) d ij I ( 8 ) The binding and unbinding dynamics are predicted using a set of con  guration - dependent rate equations . If L ij ¼ 0 , the binding dynamics are governed by the rate constant q b ( i , l i j | j , l ji ) for binding leg l ij of hub i to leg l ji of hub j . Alternatively , if L ij ¼ 1 , the unbinding dynamics are governed by q u ( i , l i j | j , l ji ) . These rate constants are continuously updated as the simulation evolves , such that q b (cid:8) i ; l i j (cid:9)(cid:9) j ; l ji (cid:10) ¼ u exp h (cid:2) b D E b (cid:8) i ; l ij (cid:9)(cid:9) j ; l ji (cid:10)i 1 þ exp h (cid:2) b D E b (cid:8) i ; l i j (cid:9)(cid:9) j ; l ji (cid:10)i ( 9 ) q u ( i , l ij | j , l ji ) ¼ u (cid:2) q b ( i , l ij | j , l ji ) ( 10 ) where D E b ( i , l i j | j , l j i ) is the change in energy of the entire system due to forming the i – j bond , calculated using eqn ( 2 ) . The reaction frequency u is a fundamental reaction rate that is independent of energy . These rate constants , as well as the forces and torques dictating motion , are calculated a  er every time integration step D t , based on the updates to the positions and connections that occur during that step . There are 4000 integration steps within each Brownian time step . Between times t and D t , we perform a dynamic Monte Carlo simulation , based on the Gillespie algorithm , 28 to determine the bonds that are made and broken during this period . This procedure starts by calculating the overall reaction rate constant q tot ¼ X N (cid:2) 1 i ¼ 1 X N j ¼ i þ 1 h q b (cid:8) i ; l ij j j ; l ji (cid:10) þ q u (cid:8) i ; l ij j j ; l ji (cid:10)i ( 11 ) We then randomly select a number g 1 between 0 and 1 , and if g 1 > exp ( (cid:2) q tot D t ) , a reaction is determined to occur .

View Article Online reaction that occurs is randomly selected based on the proba - bilities of each binding reaction p b ( i , l i j | j , l ji ) ¼ q b ( i , l i j | j , l ji ) / q tot and each unbinding reaction p u ( i , l i j | j , l ji ) ¼ q u ( i , l i j | j , l ji ) / q tot . The time of the reaction is then determined by t 0 ¼ t (cid:2) 1 q tot log f g 2 ½ exp ð(cid:2) q tot D t Þ (cid:2) 1 (cid:6) þ 1 g ( 12 ) where g 2 is a random number between 0 and 1 . The rate constants q u and q b are updated to re  ect the new connectivity , and then the dynamic Monte Carlo process is repeated over the shorter time interval t + D t (cid:2) t 0 , instead of D t . This is repeated over shorter and shorter steps until a value of g 1 is chosen such that no reactions occur . Our simulations take several days to run and represent approximately 100 ms of real time . However , experimental observations are not possible on that timescale . Therefore , we use our simulations to make qualitative predictions regarding the kinetic pathways of clathrin assembly , while choosing certain input parameters to ensure that we can observe this process within a reasonable computational time frame . Specif - ically , we set our simulated density to be 8000 hubs per m m 3 , which is 100 times higher than the density of our experimental system . Also , we set the energy - independent reaction frequency u to 400 t B (cid:2) 1 . Both of these adjustments allow many di ﬀ erent clathrin binding conformations to be attempted in our dynamic Monte Carlo scheme , resulting in large - scale assembly of cla - thrin structures in reasonable time scales . Simulation analysis The hydrodynamic radii of simulated clathrin clusters are calculated based on the equation for the drag force ~ F d on a collection of n particles moving collectively with a velocity of magnitude U in the direction of unit vector ~ e , given by ~ F d ¼ (cid:2) U X n i ¼ 1 X n j ¼ 1 H ij (cid:2) 1 $ ~ e ¼ (cid:2) x tot U ~ e ( 13 ) The cluster ' s total drag coe ﬃ cient x tot , is equal to that of a sphere with radius R H ( x tot ¼ 6 p h R H ) , allowing us to solve for R H , given the collective contributions from the hydrodynamic interaction tensors H ij between hubs i and j . We use the form of H ij developed by Rotne , Prager and Yamakawa , 29 , 30 expressed as H ij ¼ 1 8 p h r ij 2 4 1 þ 2 a 2 3 r ij 2 !

To calculate an average hydrodynamic radius that can be meaningfully compared with the results from our dynamic light scattering results , we compute the volume average hydrody - namic radius (cid:1) R H based on the calculated hydrodynamic radii of the N c individual clusters , such that R H ¼ 0 BBB @ P N c m ¼ 1 R H ; m4 P N c m ¼ 1 R H ; m3 1 CCCA ( 16 ) Acknowledgements We thank Kelly Huggins for assistance with protein puri  ca - tion , and Tom Lampo , Nick Melosh and Seb Doniach for helpful discussions .
