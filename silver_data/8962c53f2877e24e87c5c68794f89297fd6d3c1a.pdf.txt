The filter is composed of 3 layers : fenestrated endothelial cells , the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) , and epithelial cells known as podocytes ( 1 ) . The GBM is thought to act as a size - and charge - selective filter or gel . On the outer aspect of the GBM , podo - cytes spread out across capillary loops and form a tight interdigitat - ing network of membrane extensions known as foot processes . The space between adjacent foot processes is covered by a specialized cell junction complex that allows the passage of fluid and solutes . The exact mechanism of glomerular filtration is not com - pletely understood and has been the subject of modeling studies ( 2 – 5 ) . All of these models predict that the size selectivity of the GBM is not 100 % effective and is , to a certain degree , permeable to plasma proteins . In an average human , approximately 180 liters of blood is filtered by the kidney daily . Even if the GBM filtration barrier is 99 . 9 % effective , as predicted by the modeling studies , the total volume of blood flow would still result in significant amounts of plasma proteins crossing the GBM ( ~ 9 grams of albu - min and ~ 180 mg of IgG crossing the GBM every 24 hours ) . Since the slit diaphragm is considered impermeable to proteins the size of albumin or larger , we postulated that podocytes must have a mechanism to handle proteins that have crossed the GBM . It was proposed over 40 years ago that podocytes internalize and remove proteins that cross the GBM ( 6 , 7 ) . Numerous studies using electron microscopy have shown increased numbers of pro - tein - containing vesicles in podocytes under nephrotic conditions in which there is significant leakage of proteins across the GBM ( 8 – 18 ) . Previously , we showed that expression of the neonatal Fc receptor , a transcytosis receptor for Ig and albumin , allows podocytes to handle these proteins by internalization and transcytosis ( 19 ) . Fluid - phase uptake in cells occurs through 2 distinct processes ( 20 ) . Micropinocytosis is a nonspecific process that results in small vesicles of less than 0 . 1 μ m in diameter and involves both coated and noncoated vesicles ( 21 ) . A second , more specialized process called macropinocytosis only occurs in certain cell types . It involves the formation of large vesicles measuring 0 . 2 – 5 μ m in diameter that form at sites of membrane ruffling ( 22 ) . Macropino - cytosis is clathrin independent , but requires actin , RAC1 , and PI 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) . In certain cells like immature DCs and macro - phages , macropinocytosis is a constitutive process ( 23 , 24 ) ; in other cells , it is induced by extracellular stimuli , such as growth factors ( 25 ) . Macropinocytosis allows for efficient internaliza - tion of extracellular fluids ( up to 1 cell volume of fluid / hour ) , and because of the larger size of the vesicles , it is also more efficient for the uptake of large - sized molecules . Here , we discovered that podocytes internalize fluid via mac - ropinocytosis and that the rate can be increased by free fatty acids ( FFAs ) bound to albumin . Distinct from other known regulators of macropinocytosis , we found that lipid - binding GPCRs and G β / G γ subunits regulate macropinocytosis in podocytes . Macropinocyto - sis may function to maintain the GBM by removing proteins that cross the GBM . In a proteinuric setting , however , this response Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells in the kidney glomerulus that play important structural and functional roles in maintaining the filtration barrier .

Increased uptake of FITC - albumin and FITC - dextran ( data not shown ) by podocytes also occurred in Adriamycin - treated mice , a different model of nephrotic syndrome , as compared with that observed in untreated control mice ( Figure 1 , G and H ) . These results suggested that uptake of extracellular fluid is stimulated in podocytes during proteinuria . Albumin stimulates macropinocytosis in podocytes . To study fluid - phase endocytosis in podocytes in vitro , we incubated immortalized podocytes in culture with 70 kDa FITC - dextran . In the absence of any stimulus , moderate amounts of uptake were detected by both immunofluorescence and flow cytometry when podocytes were incubated at 37°C , but not at 4°C ( Figure 2 , A – C ) . To mimic the increased exposure to plasma proteins during pro - teinuria , we incubated podocytes with highly abundant plasma proteins . The addition of BSA dramatically increased the uptake of FITC - dextran ( Figure 2 , A – C ) . This effect was specific to albumin , to FFAs may function as a maladaptive one , leading to podocyte dysfunction and death . Loss of albumin during proteinuria and the subsequent increase of unbound FFAs have been implicated in nephrotic syndrome as an inducer of ANGPTL4 expression in podocytes ( 26 ) . Our work suggests that FFAs may be involved in the development of nephrotic syndrome not only by inducing ANGPTL4 , but also by directly affecting podocytes . Results Podocytes are highly endocytotic in vivo . Electron micrographs of the kidney often reveal intracellular vesicles in podocytes ( 8 – 14 ) . Twenty - four hours after injection with fluorescently labeled fluid - phase tracers ( 70 kDa FITC - Ficoll ) , confocal imaging of the kidney glomerulus showed fluorescence labeling , suggesting endocytic uptake ( Figure 1A ) . To examine fluid - phase uptake during pro - teinuria , we carried out similar experiments with a mouse model of nephrotic syndrome , the laminin β 2 - KO ( Lamb2 – / – ) mouse ( 27 – 29 ) . The uptake of FITC - Ficoll was markedly increased in the Lamb2 – / – mice and occurred in cells that were labeled with podocin , a podo - cyte - specific marker ( Figure 1 , B and C ) . The increased uptake in Figure 1 . Podocytes are highly endocytotic in vivo , and endocytosis is stimulated under proteinuric conditions .

While DCs showed higher levels of uptake compared with untreated podocytes , BSA induced a rate of macropinocytosis in podocytes that surpassed that of DCs ( Figure 3C ) . Macropinocytosis in DCs was not affected by BSA , suggesting that regulation of macropinocytosis in podocytes is distinct from that in other cell types . Indeed , incubation with EGF and PDGF , which are known activators of macropinocytosis ( 25 , 32 ) , did not stimulate macropinocytosis in podocytes , even though downstream targets like ERK were activated ( Figure 3D ) . FFAs bound to albumin are the stimuli for podocyte macropinocy - tosis . A major function of albumin is to bind hydrophobic molecules ( 33 ) . In contrast to conventional BSA , FFA - free BSA did not induce macropinocytosis ( Figure 4A ) , while lipids isolated from BSA or clinical - grade human serum albumin ( HSA ) stimulated macropino - cytosis ( Figure 4B ) . This suggested that plasma lipids bound to albumin were the causative factors stimulating macropinocytosis . as the addition of IgG , another abundant plasma protein , did not have any effect ( Figure 2D ) . Stimulation of endocytosis was also observed in mice injected with BSA ( Figure 2 , E – H ) . Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy revealed that the size of the endocytosed vesicles ranged from 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 μ m ( Figure 2A ) , which suggested that the tracers were being endocy - tosed by macropinocytosis . Macropinocytosis is a specific process that can be distinguished from other types of fluid - phase uptake by the size of the endocytic vesicles and the ability to internalize larger molecules ( 30 ) . BSA enhanced uptake of high - molecu - lar - weight fluorescent tracers ( 500 kDa and 2 , 000 kDa ) ( Figure 3A ) . Treatment of cells with mannan to inhibit mannose recep - tor – mediated internalization of dextran did not affect stimulation of uptake by BSA ( Figure 3A ) . In addition , inhibition of key com - ponents of macropinocytosis ( aquaporin , PI3K , actin polymeriza - tion ) blocked BSA - stimulated dextran uptake in podocytes ( Figure 3B ) . These results indicated that the fluid - phase uptake stimulated by BSA was mediated by macropinocytosis . Figure 2 . Albumin stimulates fluid - phase uptake in podocytes .

This showed that podocytes express a variety of lipid - binding GPCRs , including FFA receptors 1 , 2 , and 3 ( FFAR1 , FFAR2 , and FFAR3 ) ( data not shown ) . The ligands of FFAR1 are medium - and long - chain fatty acids , whereas FFAR2 and FFAR3 bind to short - chain fatty acids . To determine their roles in podo - cyte macropinocytosis , we used siRNA or shRNA to knock down the expression of these receptors ( Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure 1A ; supplemental material available online with this article ; doi : 10 . 1172 / JCI79641DS1 ) . Lipid - induced macropinocytosis was decreased when any one of the FFAR isoforms was reduced ( Fig - ure 5B and Supplemental Figure 1B ) . Simultaneous knockdown of all 3 isoforms led to a further reduction ( Figure 5B ) . Triggering of GPCRs stimulates the disassembly and activa - tion of heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the G α , G β , and G γ subunits . Stimulation of podocytes with lipids induced eleva - tion of cAMP levels , a second messenger known to be regulated by GPCRs through G α signaling ( Supplemental Figure 2 , A and B ) . However , treatment of podocytes with forskolin ( an activator of adenylate cyclase ) or cAMP analogs had no effect on dextran uptake ( Supplemental Figure 2C ) . Furthermore , macropinocyto - sis was not induced when constitutively active G α S ( Q227L ) was overexpressed ( Supplemental Figure 2D ) . These results indicated that cAMP does not mediate the stimulation of macropinocytosis . The activity in the lipid extracts was resistant to boiling or hydrolysis in acid or base ( data not shown ) . Incubating the lipids with hydroxylamine ( cleavage of ester bonds ) , methanolic HCl ( cleavage of ester , glycosidic , and amide bonds ) , or periodate ( oxi - dation of sugar moieties ) also did not significantly reduce activity ( data not shown ) . We tested candidate lipid molecules to identify the active lipid compound ( s ) . Initial assays using bioactive lipids ( lysophosphat - idic acid , prostaglandins , lipopolysaccharide , sphingosylphospho - rylcholine , etc . ) or lipids with various polar head groups ( choline , ethanolamine , n - dansyl - ethanolamine , n - pyrenesulfonyl - ethano - lamine ) did not result in stimulation of macropinocytosis ( data not shown ) . However , several different FFAs , including oleic acid , eico - satrienoic acid ( ETA ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , and docosa - hexaenoic acid ( DHA ) stimulated macropinocytosis in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 4C ) . When combined , the different FFAs had an additive effect and induced dextran uptake to levels comparable to those in BSA lipid extracts ( Figure 4D ) . Thus , sev - eral different FFAs can stimulate macropinocytosis in podocytes . Stimulation of macropinocytosis by albumin - associated FFAs is mediated by lipid - binding GPCRs and G β . Since many lipids induce their effects through specific receptors , we searched podocyte expression datasets ( 34 ) for expression of lipid receptors , focus - Figure 3 .

Addition of lipids extracted from BSA led to dramatic changes in cell morphology , with formation of filopodial structures ( Supple - mental Figure 5A ) . We noted similar changes after ETA treatment ( Supplemental Figure 5A ) . The Rho GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are key regulators of macropinocytosis . To determine whether albumin - associated lipids activate RAC1 and CDC42 , podocytes were transfected with fluorescence reso - nance energy transfer ( FRET ) biosensors and analyzed using live cell imaging . Albumin - associated lipids rapidly induced activation of both RAC1 and CDC42 ( Supplemental Figure 5 , B and C ) . Con - firming the role of RAC1 , the addition of a RAC inhibitor attenu - ated macropinocytosis ( Supplemental Figure 5D ) . High - fat diet potentiates Adriamycin - induced proteinuria . To test the role of FFAs on podocyte function in vivo , we placed mice on a high - fat diet ( HFD ) to increase plasma FFA levels ( Figure 7A ) . After 8 weeks on the diet , we did not detect significant lev - els of albuminuria in either control or HFD - fed mice ( Figure 7B , day 0 ) , suggesting that elevated levels of FFAs by themselves do not induce proteinuria in mice . To test whether FFAs could aggra - vate proteinuria , we injected mice with a low dose of Adriamycin to cause podocyte injury . Following Adriamycin administration , we noted a significantly higher urine albumin / creatinine ratio in HFD - fed mice compared with that in control mice ( Figure 7B , days 4 and 7 ) . Notably , 2 of 5 HFD - fed mice eventually went on In addition to triggering the G α subunit , GPCR signaling induces the release of the G β / G γ complex , which activates its own downstream effectors , including PI3K and RAC1 ( 35 ) . To deter - mine whether the G β / G γ complex mediates lipid - induced mac - ropinocytosis , we incubated podocytes with gallein , an inhibitor of G β . Fluorescein , a compound similar in structure to gallein that does not inhibit G β , was used as a control . Gallein reduced basal and lipid - induced dextran uptake in podocytes ( Figure 6A ) . High concentrations of gallein almost completely blocked the stimula - tion of micropinocytosis by lipids . These results were confirmed using shRNA to inhibit expres - sion of G β . Expression analysis showed that 2 of the 4 G β iso - forms , G β 1 and G β 2 , are expressed in cultured podocytes ( data not shown ) . Immunoblotting with isoform - specific Abs showed a significant reduction of specific G β isoforms in Gnb1 and Gnb2 single - knockdown podocytes ( Figure 6B and Supplemental Figure 3A ) . Knockdown of either Gnb1 or Gnb2 impaired macropinocy - tosis induced by lipid ( Figure 6C and Supplemental Figure 3B ) . Knockdown was less efficient in the Gnb1 / Gnb2 double - knock - down cells , consistent with the idea that the complete absence of G β is toxic to the cells ( Figure 6B and Supplemental Figure 4 ) . Nonetheless , knockdown of both G β isoforms further reduced lip - id - induced macropinocytosis ( Figure 6C ) . This confirms that the response to lipids is mediated by G β / G γ subunits . Albumin - associated FFAs induce changes in actin structures and activate RAC1 and CDC42 . Macropinosomes are formed at sites of membrane ruffling . To analyze the changes in the actin Figure 4 .

These results suggest that high FFA lev - els can aggravate podocyte injury and exacerbate proteinuria . Discussion Large vesicles within podocytes are often seen by electron micros - copy in proteinuric kidney diseases ( 7 ) . There has been much speculation about the origin of these vesicles ( 36 – 39 ) , but their functional significance has remained unresolved . Recent studies have demonstrated that impairment of the endocytic machinery in podocytes leads to proteinuria , indicating that endocytosis may play a crucial role in podocyte function ( 19 , 40 , 41 ) . Our results reveal that podocytes induce significant levels of macropinocyto - sis in response to FFAs . FFAs stimulate macropinocytosis through a pathway distinct from that in other cell types , one that involves FFARs , G β / G γ , and RAC1 . Our results indicate that podocytes are capable of internal - izing large amounts of extracellular fluid and molecules by mac - ropinocytosis . Demonstrating whether fluid - phase uptake occurs by macropinocytosis is not a straightforward task because of the nonspecific nature of its cargo and the lack of signature marker proteins . The uptake of large molecules is considered the most reliable measure of macropinocytosis . Tracer molecules larger than 70 kDa are internalized predominantly by macropinocyto - sis , since the small size of micropinosomes or endosomes restricts both the size and numbers of high molecular weight molecules ( 42 ) . We showed that podocytes were able to efficiently internal - ize 70 kDa dextran in vivo ( Figure 1 , A – C ) and even larger dextrans ( up to 2 , 000 kDa ) in vitro ( Figure 3A ) , consistent with macropino - cytosis . Suppression of uptake by inhibitors of PI3K , aquaporin , and actin polymerization further lends support for macropinocy - tosis as the phenomenon we measured ( Figure 3B ) . The role of macropinocytosis varies depending on cell type . Immature DCs use macropinocytosis as a means of surveying the surrounding environment for foreign pathogens ( 23 ) . In Dictyos - telium and Ras - transformed cells , macropinocytosis serves as a major pathway for nutrient supply ( 43 , 44 ) . In some conditions , macropinocytosis is transiently induced by certain stimuli such as phorbol esters or growth factors such as EGF or CSF - 1 ( 25 , 32 , 45 ) . Our work suggests that macropinocytosis may be involved in the removal of plasma proteins that enter and cross the GBM . Because the filter is not completely effective , it has been argued that an active clearance mechanism must exist to prevent the filter from clogging . The high expression of receptors for albumin , IgG , and complement on podocytes support the idea that podocytes play a specialized role in the uptake and removal of plasma pro - teins that cross the GBM . Macropinocytosis may also be a route of nutrient uptake in podocytes , similar to Ras - transformed cells ( 43 , 44 ) . Podocytes are unique in that they are located wholly in the urinary space and are separated from the blood supply by the GBM . This might restrict their exposure to nutrients , partially explaining why podo - cytes exhibit constitutive autophagy and why impairing autoph - agy is detrimental to podocytes ( 46 , 47 ) . We observed trafficking of the macropinosomes to the lysosomes in podocytes ( data not shown ) , and it is therefore plausible to speculate that proteins internalized via macropinocytosis can be degraded and used as a source of energy and anabolic substrates . It is interesting that FFAs can induce macropinocytosis . FFAs have been implicated in a feedback loop that mediates the hyper - triglyceridemia that accompanies nephrotic syndrome ( 26 ) . Sig - nificant urinary loss of albumin decreases the plasma lipid – buff - ering capacity , leading to elevated levels of unbound FFAs ( 26 ) . It was recently shown that this elevation of FFAs increases circu - lating ANGPTL4 , which inhibits lipoprotein lipase , and thereby leads to elevated plasma triglycerides ( 26 ) . Notably , ANGPTL4 produced from podocytes induces proteinuria in rats through mechanisms that are yet to be elucidated ( 26 , 48 ) . We found that FFAs induced ANGPTL4 expression in podocytes ( Supple - mental Figure 6 ) , indicating that FFAs could induce proteinuria through ANGPTL4 induction . Our findings , however , also suggest that FFAs could affect pro - teinuria by directly altering podocyte function and viability . We and others have previously shown that RAC1 activation in podo - cytes leads to podocyte foot process effacement and proteinuria in mice ( 49 , 50 ) . In addition , excessive macropinocytosis and accumulation of albumin in podocytes has been shown to induce lysosomal dysfunction , podocyte loss , and subsequent glomerulo - Figure 5 . Stimulation of macropinocytosis by albumin - associated lipids is mediated by FFARs . ( A ) Ffar - knockdown podocytes were analyzed by quantita - tive PCR . Results are shown as the fold change of mRNA levels compared with those of controls .

Consistent with this , we found that mice with elevated FFA levels were more susceptible to Adriamycin and exhibited significantly higher levels of albuminuria ( Figure 7 ) . The effects of a HFD on the kidney are complex , and there may be additional factors that are affecting proteinuria , but the results are consistent with a role for FFAs . It is intriguing to consider the possibility that an interplay between FFAs and ANGPTL4 plays a critical role in the transition from proteinuria to full - blown nephrotic syndrome . Podocyte injury would lead to proteinuria , but the transition to nephrotic syndrome might involve the elevation of both plasma FFAs and ANGPTL4 . The combined effect of albuminuria and hyperlipidemia ( caused by elevated ANGPTL4 ) would lead to an increase in the FFA / albu - min ratio . Once the level of FFAs exceeds the buffering capacity of albumin , the FFAs could play a key role in a vicious cycle of persis - tent albuminuria and podocyte damage that converts proteinuria into nephrotic syndrome . In support of this idea , lipoprotein apher - esis to lower lipid levels reduces proteinuria and improves renal function in some patients with nephrotic syndrome ( 56 ) . While it is unclear whether elevated plasma FFAs are sufficient by themselves to initiate proteinuria , our work suggests that once proteinuria has begun , FFAs can amplify the consequences of proteinuria . Taken together , we have identified a pathway of inducible macropinocytosis in podocytes that may play a role in mainte - nance of the glomerular filtration barrier . Persistent activation of this pathway during proteinuria , however , may have maladaptive consequences and lead to nephrotic syndrome . FFAs and FFARs are new potential targets for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome . Methods Reagents .

All mice were housed in a specific pathogen – free facility at Washington University School of Medicine . C57BL / 6J , 129 / SvJ , and BALB / cJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory . Laminin β 2 – knockout ( Lamb2 – / – ) mice with a muscle - specific rescue transgene have been described previously ( 27 – 29 ) . For HFD experiments , age - and weight - matched male 129 / SvJ mice were randomly grouped and given a normal chow diet ( 13 kcal % fat ; LabDiet ) or a HFD ( 60 kcal % fat , D12492 ; Research Diets Inc . ) . After 8 weeks on the diet , mice were injected i . v . with Adriamycin ( 10 mg / kg body weight ) or an equal vol - ume of saline as a control . Cell culture . Conditionally immortalized podocytes were generated as described previously ( 59 ) and maintained at 33°C in RPMI1640 sup - plemented with 10 % FBS , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 10 mM HEPES , 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 μ g / ml streptomycin , 0 . 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , and 100 U / ml recombinant mouse IFN - γ ( a gift of Robert Schreiber , Washington University , St . Louis , Missouri , USA ) . BM - derived DCs were cultured as previously described ( 60 ) . Briefly , BM cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium ( IMDM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hyclone ) , 1 mM Figure 6 . Stimulation of macropinocytosis by albu - min - associated lipids is mediated by G β activation . ( A ) Podocytes were pretreated with 2 or 10 μ M fluorescein or gallein for 30 minutes . Subsequently , the cells were incubated with BSA lipid extract in the presence of rhodamine B – dextran for 30 minutes and analyzed by flow cytometry . ( B ) Podocytes expressing shRNAs targeting firefly luciferase ( fLuc ) , Gnb1 , Gnb2 , or Gnb1 and Gnb2 ( Gnb1 / 2 ) were immunoblotted for G β 1 and G β 2 expression . β - Actin was used as a loading control .

FACS data were collected on FACSCanto II or LSR II flow cytometers ( BD Bio - sciences ) and analyzed with FlowJo software . Western blots . Podocytes were lysed in a modi - fied radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxy - cholate , 1 mM PMSF , 1 μ g / ml aprotinin , 1 μ g / ml leupeptin , 1 μ g / ml pepstatin , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM NaF ) for 30 minutes on ice . The protein content of the lysates was quantified with a protein assay kit ( Bio - Rad ) . Equivalent amounts of each sample were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellu - lose membranes , and immunoblotted for phospho - rylated ERK ( p - ERK ) , CD2AP , G β 1 , G β 2 , or β - actin . The blots were visualized by ECL or infrared imag - ing on a LI - COR Odyssey system ( LI - COR ) . Lipid extraction . Lipids were extracted from BSA or HSA using the Bligh - Dyer method with minor modifications . Three milliliters of 20 % BSA in ddH 2 O was added to a mixture of 6 ml chloroform and 12 ml methanol in a glass tube and mixed on an orbital shaker for 15 minutes at room temperature . Chloroform ( 6 ml ) was added to the mixture while vortexing at low speeds , followed by 6 ml of 1 M NaCl . The samples were centrifuged at 800 g for 5 minutes to separate the aqueous and organic phases . The lower organic phase was carefully collected , aliquoted into 1 - ml tubes , evaporated under vacuum , and stored at – 80°C . For endocytosis assays , the lipids were resuspended in 30 μ l DMSO , and the cells were treated with 1 to 5 μ l / ml lipid suspension . Assuming loss of 50 % of the lipids during extraction , this is esti - mated to be equivalent to the amount of lipids bound to BSA in a 0 . 066 % to 0 . 33 % solution . Gene knockdown and overexpression experiments . ON - TARGETplus siRNA targeting FFAR isoforms was purchased from Dharmacon ( GE Healthcare ) . Podocytes were transfected with a pool of siRNAs con - taining 4 individual siRNAs targeting each isoform using the Nucle - ofector System ( Lonza ) . Transfection efficiency was monitored using the siGLO Green Transfection Indicator ( GE Healthcare ) . Lentiviral constructs containing shRNAs targeting FFAR isoforms , G β isoforms , and firefly luciferase ( control ) were generated using the pFLRu - YFP lentiviral vector ( 61 ) . The targeting sequences were : fLuc , CCAACCCTATTCTCCTTCT ; FFAR1 , ATCTTTGCCTTGGCCCAC - TTTG ; FFAR2 , CGGTTTGCTACTGATCCGCAAT ; FFAR3 , ACTG - GAACTGAAGGTAAAGAAT ; GNB1 , CATTATCTGTGGTAT CACA ; GNB2 , CATCTGCTCCATCTATAGT . PCR products containing the U6 promoter followed by the shRNA sequences were cloned into the pFL - Ru - YFP vector using the XbaI / XhoI site . For lentivirus production , 293T cells were transfected with the lentiviral constructs along with packaging plasmids ( pMDLg / pRRE and pRSV - Rev ) and an envelope plasmid ( pMD2 . G ) . Proliferating podocytes were infected with supernatants containing lentivirus and 8 μ g / ml protamine sulfate for 24 hours . Cells expressing high levels of YFP were sorted on a FACSAria II flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) 7 days after infection . To generate podocytes stably expressing constitutively active G α s , cells were transfected with a pcDNA3 . 1 vector containing G α S ( Q227L ) ( a gift of Kun - Liang Guan , UCSD , San Diego , California , USA ) . Sta - sodium pyruvate , 10 mM HEPES , 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 μ g / ml streptomycin , 0 . 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , and 100 ng / ml recombi - nant granulocyte macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( rGM - CSF ) ( R & D Systems ) for 8 days . Electron microscopy . Slices of kidney cortex or podocytes cultured on coverslips were fixed overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) and 4 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer followed by repeated washes in PBS . After postfixation in 1 % osmium tetraoxide , the samples were reduced with 1 . 5 % potassium ferrocyanide for 1 hour at 4°C . Subsequently , the samples were washed , dehydrated in graded alcohol , and embedded in resin according to standard protocols . In vivo endocytosis . WT or Lamb2 – / – mice were injected i . v . with a bolus of FITC - Ficoll ( 70 kDa ) or FITC - dextran ( 10 kDa ) in 0 . 9 % NaCl at a dose of 250 mg / kg of body weight . BALB / cJ mice were injected i . v . with Adriamycin ( 10 mg / kg body weight ) or an equal volume of saline as a control . Six days after the Adriamycin injection , the mice were injected i . v . with FITC - labeled albumin ( 250 mg / kg body weight ) . For BSA injection experiments , mice ( C57BL / 6J and 129 / SvJ mixed background ) were given a daily i . p . injection of endotoxin - free BSA ( 15 mg / g body weight in PBS ) for 4 days . On day 4 , the mice were injected i . v . with 70 kDa FITC - dextran ( 250 mg / kg body weight ) . Twenty - four hours after injection of FITC - labeled tracers , kidneys were harvested from mice , embedded in OCT ( VWR International ) , and snap - frozen in methylbutane cooled in a dry ice ethanol bath . Cryosections ( 8 μ m ) were applied to charged slides using a cryostat . For immunofluorescence assays , the kidney sections were fixed with 1 % PFA in PBS for 5 minutes , followed by blocking and perme - abilization with 2 % FBS in PBS with 0 . 1 % saponin . The slides were incubated with Abs against laminin α 5 or podocin for 1 hour at room temperature , followed by extensive washing . Fluorescently conju - gated secondary Abs were then applied for 1 hour at room temper - ature . After several washes , the slides were imaged on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope . In vitro macropinocytosis assays . Mouse podocytes in 6 - well plates were serum starved with serum - free RPMI for 2 hours . The cells were then incubated in RPMI supplemented with 0 . 5 mg / ml FITC - or rho - damine B – dextran for 30 minutes on ice or at 37°C . The cells were subsequently washed 3 times with ice - cold PBS and fixed with 4 % PFA for confocal microscopic analysis or trypsinized and resuspended in Figure 7 . Mice fed a HFD are more susceptible to Adriamycin - induced proteinuria . Mice were given either a normal diet or a HFD . ( A ) After 8 weeks , serum was collected and analyzed by ELISA for FFA and albumin concentrations . ( B ) Mice were then given a single i . v . injection of Adriamycin ( 10 mg / kg ) . Urine was collected periodically after injection and analyzed for albumin / creatinine ratios . n = 3 , normal diet ; n = 5 , HFD . Samples were compared using the Student’s t test ( A ) or ANOVA , followed by Bonferroni’s post - hoc analysis ( B ) . * P ≤ 0 . 05 . The Journal of Clinical Investigation R e s e aR c h aR t i c l e 2 3 1 5 jci . org Volume 125 Number 6 June 2015 Statistics . Data are presented as the mean ± SD . We determined significance by ANOVA or a 2 - tailed Student’s t test as indicated in the figure legends .

A pcDNA3 plasmid containing the FRET - based cAMP biosensor T Epac VV was a gift of Kees Jalink ( The Neth - erlands Cancer Institute , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) . Cultured podocytes were transfected with T Epac VV using the Nucleofector Sys - tem and seeded on glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek Corp . ) . Images were obtained using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope in a temper - ature - controlled chamber ( 37°C ) . The cells were excited at 440 nm , and donor and acceptor emission was detected simultaneously using a 510 nm beamsplitter and 2 photomultipliers with optical filters : 465 – 495 nm ( CFP ) and 535 to 565 nm ( YFP ) . FRET measurements were quantified using ImageJ software ( NIH ) and the Ratio Plus plugin . After regions were drawn around individual cells , emission ratios were obtained by calculating FRET intensities divided by donor intensities . Time - course ratio measure - ments were normalized to baseline values before stimulation . The FRET value was set at 1 at the onset of the experiment . FFA , albumin , and creatinine assays . Mouse serum and urine sam - ples were collected at the indicated time points . FFA ( BioVision ) , albu - min ( Bethyl Laboratories Inc . ) , and creatinine ( BioAssay Systems ) levels were quantified by ELISA according to the manufacturers’ instructions . 1 .
