Internet Growth dynamics of the World - Wide Web The exponential growth of the World - Wide Web has transformed it into an ecology of knowledge in which highly diverse informa - tion is linked in an extremely complex and arbitrary manner . But even so , as we show here , there is order hidden in the web . We find that web pages are distributed among sites according to a universal power law : many sites have only a few pages , whereas very few sites have hundreds of thousands of pages . This universal distribution can be explained by using a simple stochastic dynamical growth model . The existence of a power law in the growth of the web not only implies the lack of any length scale for the web , but also allows the expected number of sites of any given size to be determined without exhaus - tively crawling the web . The distribution of site sizes for crawls by Alexa and Infoseek is shown in Fig . 1 . Both data sets display a power law over several orders of magnitude , so on a log – log scale the distribution of the number of pages per site appears as a straight line . This distribution should not be confused with Zipf’s like distributions 1 , 2 , where a power law arises from rank order - ing the variables 3 . In order to describe the growth process underlying this distribution 4 , we assume brief communications NATURE | VOL 401 | 9 SEPTEMBER 1999 | www . nature . com 131 3 . Gunther , R . et al . Int .

There is a drop - off at approximately 10 5 pages because server limitations mean that search engines do not sys - tematically collect more pages per site than this . A linear regres - sion on the variables log ( number of sites ) and log ( number of pages ) yielded [ 1 . 647 , 1 . 853 ] as the 95 % confidence interval for the exponent b in the Alexa crawl , and [ 1 . 775 , 1 . 909 ] for the Infoseek crawl . These estimates for the power - law slope are con - sistent across the two data sets and with the model , which pre - dicts that b is greater than 1 . that the day - to - day fluctuations in site size are proportional to the size of the site . One would not be surprised to find that a site with a million pages has lost or gained a few hundred pages on any given day . On the other hand , finding an additional hundred pages on a site with just ten pages within a day would be unusual . So we assume that the number of pages on the site , n , on a given day , is equal to the number of pages on that site on the previous day plus or minus a random fraction of n . If a set of sites is allowed to grow with the same average growth rate but with indi - vidual random daily fluctuations in the number of pages added , their sizes will be distributed log - normally after a sufficiently long period of time 5 . A log - normal distrib - ution gives high probability to small sizes and small , but significant , probability to very large sizes . But although it is skewed and has a long tail , the log - normal distribu - tion is not a power - law one . Two additional factors that determine the growth of the web need to be considered : sites appear at different times and grow at different rates . The number of web sites has been growing exponentially since its incep - tion , which means that there are many more young sites than old ones . Once the age of the site is factored in to the multiplicative growth process , P ( n ) , the probability of find - ing a site of size n , is a power law , that is , it is proportional to n 1b . Similarly , considering sites with a wide range of distributions in growth rates yields the same result : a power - law distribution in site size . The simple assumption of stochastic multiplicative growth , combined with the fact that sites appear at different times and / or grow at dif - ferent rates , therefore leads to an explanation of the observed power - law behaviour . The existence of this universal power law , which is yet another example of the strong regularities 6 , 7 revealed by studies of the web , also has practical consequences . The expect - ed number of sites of any arbitrary size can be estimated , even if a site of that size has not yet been observed . This can be achieved by extrapolating the power law to any large n ; for example , P ( n 2 ) 4 P ( n 1 ) 2 ( n 2 / n 1 ) 1b . The expected number of sites of size n 2 in a crawl of N sites would be NP ( n 2 ) . For instance , from the Alexa data we can infer that , if data were collected from 250 , 000 sites , the probability of finding a site with a million pages would be 10 1 4 . This informa - tion is not readily available from the crawl alone , as it stops at 10 5 pages per site . Bernardo A . Huberman , Lada A .

Genome evolution Global methylation in eutherian hybrids O’Neill et al . propose that epigenetic pro - cesses help to drive karyotypic evolution in marsupials 1 . Here we present evidence that global methylation patterns do not undergo dramatic changes in interspecific hybrids among three orders of placental mammals , indicating that the mechanisms underlying genome evolution may be different in pla - cental mammals and marsupials . Interspecific hybridization in mammals frequently results in male sterility 2 , abnormal growth 2 and placental dysplasia 3 – 5 , which together may cause post - meiotic reproduc - tive isolation . It has been proposed that incompatibility between rapidly evolving genes that interact normally in the intraspe - cific context 6 and genomic rearrangements 7 may explain interspecific hybrid defects . O’Neill et al . have given a striking exam - ple for the latter mechanism in an interspe - cific hybrid of the marsupials Macropus eugenii and M . bicolor 1 . This first - genera - tion ( F 1 ) hybrid exhibited genome - wide demethylation , retrotransposon amplifica - tion and centromere expansion on the autosomes derived from M . eugenii . Under - methylation of F 1 genomes compared with those of the parental species was also seen in two hybrids of other species within the genus Petrogale 1 . These findings were taken to indicate that retrotransposon amplifica - tion and chromosome expansion secondary to genome - wide undermethylation could be a frequent phenomenon in mammalian hybrids , leading to rapid karyotypic evolu - tion and finally to reproductive isolation 1 . We have analysed genome - wide methyl - ation in interspecific hybrids in the placen - tal mammalian families of three orders , Equidae ( Perissodactyla ) , Muridae ( Roden - tia ) and Camelidae ( Artiodactyla ) , by fol - lowing the digestion of genomic DNA with the methylation - sensitive and methylation - insensitive enzymes Hpa II and Msp I , respectively , and Southern blotting the digest . This analysis included hybrids between horse and donkey , three species of mouse ( Mus musculus , Mus spretus and Mus macedonicus ) , and llama ( Lama glama ) and dromedary ( Camelus dromedarius ) . This analysis gave no indication for any changes in genome - wide methylation in any of the F 1 hybrids when compared with parental animals ( Fig . 1 ) . © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd activation and chromosome extension may therefore be specific to interspecific hybridization in marsupials , or perhaps they occur only in macropodid marsupials . In any case , our results argue against the idea that such profound alterations in genome organization of interspecific hybrids are common events in placental mammals . Marsupials and placental mam - mals diverged about 130 million years ago 9 , so the functional role of methylation may have changed between the two subclasses . For example , marsupial and placental mammals show pronounced differences in their processes of X - chromosome inactiva - tion 9 , in which the role of methylation is thought to be important 10 .

Metaphase spread from bone marrow was digested with HpaII followed by in situnick - translation . Staining patterns were identical with MspI . There was no detectable differ - ence in labelling intensity between M . spretusand M . musculus euchromatin . The faint labelling of M . musculuscompared with M . spretuscentromeric heterochromatin reflects the low frequency of MspI / HpaII sites inM . musculusmajor satellite DNA . In addition , we assessed cytosine methyl - ation by in situ nick - translation on the metaphase chromosomes of mouse F 1 hybrids and parental mice . For this analysis , mice of the Mus musculus strain Cremona were used . Because this strain has an aber - rant chromosome number ( 2 N 4 22 instead of 40 ) , it is possible to discriminate between the chromosomes derived from Mus muscu - lus Cremona and Mus spretus in F 1 hybrids ( Fig . 2 ) . This analysis indicated that no major change had occurred in genome - wide demethylation or in centromere expansion . Finally , we were unable to detect amplification of the L1 retrotransposon by Southern - blot analysis ( results not shown ) . These results do not appear to agree with those obtained by O’Neill et al . 1 in their analysis of interspecific hybrids between several different species of macropodid marsupials . However , their findings are unequivocal and supported by earlier cyto - genetic investigations of hybrids between additional macropodid species 8 .

O’Neill et al . reply — The absence of global methylation changes in eutherian interspe - cific hybrids compared with their parents , observed by Roemer et al . , sharply contrasts with our own studies of interspecific hybrids between various species of kanga - roo . We observed hybrid - specific under - methylation , retroelement activation and genome remodelling 1 , and suggested that these events occurring together may bring about rapid karyotypic change . We agree with Roemer et al . that mar - supials and eutherians are likely to have diverged from one another in their reliance on and use of the epigenetic infor - mation conveyed by DNA methylation . Although these events may be specific to marsupial or even macropod interspecific hybrids , there is evidence that eutherian genomes may be subject to at least some degree of the same sort of hybrid dysgenic perturbations . Interspecific hybrids of the genus Peromyscus ( deer mice ) do not show whole - genome changes in methylation , as determined by digestion with Msp I and Hpa II ( R . J . W . O’N . et al . , unpublished observations ) , yet they exhibit disruptions in imprinted gene expression associated with allele - specific undermethylation 2 . The mechanism underlying the loss of imprinting in these hybrids remains unknown , but there is a subtle change in methylation in this eutherian hybrid cross 2 . Digestion of genomic DNA with Msp I and Hpa II may be too blunt an instrument to reveal subtle changes ( less than 20 % ) in methylation . Our main finding is a link between DNA methylation , retroelement activity and genome rearrangement . The dramatic perturbations of methylation and genome structure that we observed in kangaroo hybrids may be an extreme example of dys - genic changes that occur on a broader scale in many organisms .
