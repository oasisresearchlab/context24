Methods Complete volumes of ﬁve major epidemiological journals in the period 2005 - 2015 were searched via Pubmed . In addition we performed an extensive within - manuscript search using a specialized Java application . Details of reporting on Bayesian statistics were examined in original research papers with primary Bayesian data analyses . Results The number of studies in which Bayesian techniques were used for primary data analysis remain constant over the years . Though many authors presented thorough descriptions of the analyses they performed and the results they obtained , several reports presented incomplete method sections , and even some incomplete results sections . Especially , information on the process of prior elicitation , speciﬁcation and evaluation was often lacking . Conclusions Though available guidance papers concerned with reporting of Bayesian analyses emphasize the importance of transparent prior speciﬁcation , the results obtained in this systematic review show that these guidance papers are often not used . Additional eﬀorts should be made to increase the awareness of the existence and importance of these checklists in order to overcome the controversy with respect to the use of Bayesian techniques . The reporting quality in epidemiological literature could be improved by updating existing guidelines on the reporting of frequentist analyses to address issues that are important for Bayesian data analyses . M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 3 What is new ? • For the reviewed epidemiological journals the number of studies in which Bayesian analyses were used remain constant over the years . • Often information on the process of prior elicitation , speciﬁcation and evaluation was lacking from research reports . • Several guidance papers have recently been published on transparent reporting of research results . Our review indicates that adherence to these guidelines seems particularly urgent for Bayesian data analyses , as controversy around their implementation often relates to the choice of prior distributions . • The reporting quality of papers in epidemiological journals could be improved by updating existing guidelines on reporting to speciﬁcally address issues that are relevant for both frequentist and Bayesian data analyses . M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 4 1 Background Over the past few decades an extensive body of literature has been published describing the rationale and ( potential ) advantages of Bayesian data analysis techniques within epidemiological research ( see for example [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] ) . These articles discuss the advantages and ﬂexibility of Bayesian approaches in the process of , for example , prediction model development , interim analysis , and sample size calculation . Despite the attention Bayesian techniques receive in methodological literature , at the beginning of the millennium the use of Bayesian methods in applied research seemed limited . This conclusion followed from an non - systematic search in the medical literature by Altman [ 8 ] and from a systematic review by Spiegelhalter et al . [ 9 ] which focussed on statistical methods in health technology assessment . A recent update of this review more than a decade later revealed a huge increase in the use of Bayesian statistics in the ﬁeld of health technology assessment [ 10 ] . Furthermore , in a review on the use of Bayesian statistics in publications in Statistics in Medicine [ 11 ] it was concluded that the use of Bayesian methodology had increased in all major areas of medical statistics . On the other hand , in a review on the current state of Bayesian methods in medical product development [ 12 ] only a slight increase in the implementation of these techniques was found . In addition , the persistency of the underuse of Bayesian methods in current research was reported by Pibouleau [ 13 ] in a review on the evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of implantable medical devices . Given the increasing acknowledgement of Bayesian statistics , and the diﬀerent conclusions drawn in the above reviews , we question whether the conclusion of the underuse of these techniques is still justiﬁed for the ﬁeld of epidemiological research . Therefore , with the current study we aim to update the series of reviews of Bayesian techniques that were done in related research areas as mentioned above with an extensive systematic review on the use of Bayesian techniques in epidemiological research in general in the period 2005 - 2015 . Furthermore , several guidelines have been developed to help researchers to report on Bayesian data analyses in a structured and transparent manner ( see for example BayesWatch [ 9 ] , the BaSiS guidelines for reporting Bayesian Analysis [ 15 ] , and the ROBUST criteria as speciﬁed by Sung et al . [ 16 ] ) . It remains unclear whether these guidelines were implemented successfully in epidemiological research . Therefore , in addition to gaining insight in the num - ber of Bayesian publication we aim to evaluate the reporting quality in the identiﬁed research reports . M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 5 2 Methods 2 . 1 Search strategy The search for studies reporting Bayesian data analysis focussed on issues of original research papers pub - lished in the top - 5 epidemiological journals ( ISI Web of Knowledge , 2010 ) as displayed in Table 1 . Table 1 : Epidemiological Journal Rankings on 5 - year Impact Factor According to ISI Web of Knowledge Top - 5 Epidemiological Journals Abbreviated journal title American Journal of Epidemiology Am . J . Epidemiol . International Journal of Epidemiology Int . J . Epidemiol . Epidemiology Epidemiol . Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health J . Epidemiol . Community Health Journal of Clinical Epidemiology J . Clin . Epidemiol . To select only original research reports and exclude publications such as editorials , letters , and commen - taries , we made use of the PubMed Publication Characteristics ( Publication Types ) . Eligible publication types are clinical trials ( phase I - IV ) , journal articles , multicenter studies , randomized controlled trials , com - parative studies , technical reports , controlled clinical trials , twin studies , evaluation studies , and validation studies . Identiﬁcation of eligible papers published within the selected journals and journal types , followed the two search paths as displayed in Figure 1 . The left - hand side of the ﬂow diagram shows the identiﬁcation of epidemiological or medical studies using PubMed with the search terms [ Bayes * OR MCMC OR ”credible interval” ] in combination with the name of each of the epidemiological and medical journals separately and the period of interest ( e . g . , [ ( Bayes * OR MCMC OR credible interval ) AND ”J . Clin . Epidemiol . ” [ Journal ] AND ”2005 / 01 / 01” [ Entrez Date ] : ”2005 / 12 / 31” [ Entrez Date ] ] ) . Since we expected authors not to provide a detailed description of the performed analyses in titles , abstracts and keywords , and since Pubmed does not index publications based on analysis technique , we expected that the above search strategy would not be able to identify all relevant research papers . Therefore a full text within - manuscript search was required . The course of this part of the search is displayed on the righthand side of Figure 1 . A specialized Java - application that enabled automated downloading and indexing of manuscripts was written for this purpose [ 14 ] . This application employs Entrez Programming Utilities to perform search queries and retrieve article information ( such as title , abstract , authors , keywords ) from the Pubmed library . The article information is identical to the information provided by the Pubmed website , and can be used for retrieving its full text ( original PDF ﬁles ) , provided that the user is subscribed to the corresponding journal . The application was extended with M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 6 a module to allow searching within the full text of the retrieved articles . This module is based on Apache Lucene , a text search engine library written in Java . We used the specialized application to retrieve all research papers from the journals and time periods un - der consideration ( e . g . , [ ”J . Clin . Epidemiol . ” [ Journal ] AND ”2005 / 01 / 01” [ Entrez Date ] : ”2005 / 12 / 31” [ En - trez Date ] ] ) . Afterwards , we employed the text search module for searching full text publications of all research papers on the occurrence of ”Bayes * ” in the title , abstract , keywords and full text of the retrieved articles . This strategy ensures that at least all results from the Pubmed website search are reproduced , as the article information provided by Pubmed as well as the corresponding content are analyzed . A representative sample of all publications was obtained by only including research reports published in odd years in the period 2005 - 2015 . Records identified through PUBMED searching 116 records Additional records identified through within - manuscript searching 251 records Total identified 367 records Full - text articles excluded 83 reported no primary Bayesian analysis 31 reported meta - analysis 183 reported no Bayesian analysis Studies included in review 70 reported primary Bayesian analysis I d e n t i f i c a t i o n S c r ee n i n g E li g i b ili t y I n c l ud e d Figure 1 : Flow diagram of systematic review results To compare our results with the total number of research papers published by each journal we counted the number of published research reports per journal in the relevant years . We therefore used the classiﬁcations as indexed by the journals . For example we counted publications categorized as ”research reports” , ”original M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 7 contributions’ , ”short reports” , and excluded categories like ”reviews” and ”commentaries” . 2 . 1 . 1 Inclusion and Exclusion criteria From the reports that were identiﬁed with either search strategy , papers that only mentioned Bayesian statistics as an alternative to the classical approach , or that only reported the Bayesian Information Criterion were excluded and classiﬁed as not Bayesian . Furthermore , Bayesian meta - analyses fell outside the scope of this review . Finally , a category of studies that did not report on primary Bayesian analyses were excluded . These studies did not report the use of Bayesian statistics for the main part of the primary data analysis , e . g . studies in which Bayesian statistics were used to develop a scale to measure one of the predictor variables , but in which Bayesian statistics were not used to assess the association between the determinants and the main outcome . In addition , papers reporting empirical Bayesian analyses were excluded and classiﬁed as being not a primary Bayesian analyses , since this approach contradicts the conceptual theory of the Bayesian paradigm , and , in fact , can often be reformulated as a frequentist analysis . The numbers of excluded reports are listed in Figure 1 . 2 . 2 Assesment of Reporting Quality From the primary Bayesian analyses additional information on the design and analysis of the study was obtained using a standardized item list . This item list was based on the guidelines of the BayesWatch as introduced by Spiegelhalter et al . [ 9 ] , the BaSiS guidelines for reporting Bayesian Analysis [ 15 ] , and the ROBUST criteria as speciﬁed by Sung et al . [ 16 ] . The list was designed to collect information on the objective of the study , the design of data collection , the statistical model used , how prior distributions were speciﬁed , whether and how sensitivity analyses were part of the prior speciﬁcation procedure , the statistical package used for analysis , and how the results were reported . Because of the workload searches in Pubmed and within - manuscripts were performed by three assessors . A ﬁrst set of ten articles was screened for eligibility and coded by at least two coders until full agreement was reached . Subsequent articles were coded by a single coder , in case of unclarities other members of the coding team were consulted .

Using PubMed we found a total of 116 epidemiological research articles reporting one of our search terms . An additional 251 hits were found through the within - manuscript search . After screening and eligibility assessment of all the 367 articles we excluded 297 papers that were either not primary Bayesian analyses , or were Bayesian meta - analyses , or that were not Bayesian at all , for example when Bayes was only mentioned in reference lists ( see Figure 1 ) . We included 70 epidemiological studies that used Bayesian statistics for primary data analysis ( see overview in the Appendix ) . In Table 2 we present our search results separately per journal . In the ﬁrst column of the table we report the total number of research papers published by these journals . Figure 2 visualizes the development of the use of Bayesian statistics for primary data analyses within the top - 5 epidemiological journals over the period 2005 - 2015 in the order as presented in Table 1 . As shown , the number of primary Bayesian analyses per year ﬂuctuates between six and 15 publications per year , and does not show a clear pattern of increase or decrease over the investigated years .

In the following subsections we describe the most important ﬁndings in more detail . 3 . 1 . 1 Description of the included studies : objective and design of data collection The ﬁrst three items provide a general description on the type of studies published using Bayesian data analysis . The majority of the studies had an etiologic or prognostic research objective ( 49 / 70 and 12 / 70 respectively ) . Most studies made use of observational data obtained from registers , census and surveillance data ( 29 / 70 ) or from prospective , retrospective or cross - sectional cohorts ( 26 / 70 ) .

This category comprises various types of ( hierarchical ) regression models with diﬀerent distributions assumed for the outcome variables ( Poisson , normal , multinomial , etc . ) , and diﬀerent link functions used ( logit , log etc . ) . MCMC sampling was the common estimation type used for these analyses ( 26 / 40 ) , mostly performed with OpenBUGS ( 20 / 26 ) . One study reported R ( package not further speciﬁed ) for MCMC sampling and two studies used MLWin . Four reports did not mention the software used for MCMC sampling . Nested Laplace approximation in R ( package not further speciﬁed ) was reported for the estimation of the ( hierarchical ) regression models four times . One study used the package ’tlnise’ for estimation . Remarkably , in twelve of the reports the estimation type was not mentioned . Bayesian statistics were used as a standard technique for haplotyping , genotyping and phylogenetical studies ( 8 / 70 ) . MCMC sampling in these cases was performed in specialized packages PHASE ( 7 / 8 ) and BEAST ( 1 / 8 ) . Other models were classiﬁed as survival models ( 6 / 70 ) , time series ( 4 / 70 ) , geostatistical or spatial M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 10 models ( 7 / 70 ) , latent class models ( 1 / 70 ) and mathematical disease transmission models ( 2 / 70 ) . In 17 of these 20 studies MCMC sampling was performed in either OpenBUGS ( 8 / 17 ) or R ( package not further speciﬁed , or ’tlnise’ package ) ( 2 / 17 ) . And in seven reports we could not ﬁnd information on the type of software used for MCMC sampling . Nested laplace approximation in R ( package not further speciﬁed ) was reported in two that estimated spatial models . For one spatial model the estimation type was not reported . In two study reports no information on the statistical model was presented . From the reports it became clear that MCMC sampling was used , and in one report posterior estimates were reported ( posterior mean estimates and intervals of percentage reduction in disease transmission rates ) , but in one report no posterior results are reported . 3 . 1 . 3 Prior and sensitivity analysis A total of 33 out of 70 evaluated studies did not report any information regarding the speci - ﬁcation of the priors used in the analyses . In eight studies a combination of informative and uninformative priors was used . Other studies reported either the use of uninformative priors ( 21 ) , or informative priors ( 4 ) , or data - driven priors ( 4 ) . Out of the 37 epidemiological studies that reported information on the type of priors used , only four reported the analysis of the sensitivity of the posterior distribution for changes in the prior distribution . The remaining 33 studies did not report any information on this topic . Whether the lack of reporting on sensitivity analyses indicated either the absence of sensitivity analyses or the absence of reporting on it remained unclear . The four studies that reported on this type of sensitivity analyses all reported on the comparison of results obtained with several priors . Only three of them explained and presented the diﬀerent priors that were tried in a way that makes it possible to reproduce the results . Subsequently , in all reports it was concluded that the results were robust for changes in the prior distributions . In only one of these reports the actual results of the sensitivity analyses are presented to the reader . 3 . 1 . 4 Reporting of results For this section on the item list the results do not add up to the total number of included studies , since each study could report multiple types of results . In most of the included studies ( 65 / 70 ) a combination of some posterior estimates and a type of 95 % posterior interval ( mostly a Central Credibility Interval ) was presented . In 23 of these studies the authors clariﬁed whether a posterior mean , mode or median was reported , in the other cases this was not clariﬁed . M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 11 In addition , 11 studies reported posterior estimates without credible intervals , and 1 study mentioned only the interval and omitted the point estimates . Other types of results reported were the deviance information criterion ( DIC ) in 13 studies , posterior probabilities in 3 studies , Bayes Factors in 4 studies , standard errors in 4 reports , and a posterior predictive p - values ( ppp - value ) in one report . As mentioned before , in one report we could not ﬁnd Bayesian study results . 4 Discussion Over the past few decades , the use of Bayesian statistics has increasingly been suggested as a promising alternative for frequentist data analysis . Concurrently , several ’checklists’ concerned with reporting on Bayesian data analyses were published . We investigated the current position of Bayesian statistics in epidemiological research by means of a systematic review and evaluated the reporting quality in the identiﬁed research reports . We found the number of primary Bayesian analysis to remain constant over the past decade within the selected journals . The actual number of studies using Bayesian techniques for primary data analysis remains rather low . This is consistent with the ﬁndings reported in several earlier reviews ( [ 8 , 9 , 12 , 13 ] ) . In addition to earlier studies , we found that the quality of reporting on Bayesian analyses was rather low . Though many authors presented thorough descriptions of the analyses they performed , we encountered several reports that presented incomplete method sections , and even some incomplete results sections . In particular , about half of the studies failed to report any information on the type of prior distributions used for the analyses . This information is crucial to evaluate their inﬂuence on the ﬁnal results , and to interpret diﬀerences that may exist when analyzing the data using frequentist approaches . In addition to this , the large majority of the studies did not inform the reader whether and how sensitivity analyses with respect to the prior distribution were performed , and what the actual outcomes of these analyses were . It remains unclear whether sensitivity analyses were not performed , or performed but unreported . This information is not only valuable to the primary investigator , but also informs the reader on the stability and reliability of the results . It comes to no surprise that the importance of sensitivity analyses is often emphasized in existing checklists on Bayesian data analyses ( see [ 9 , 15 , 16 ] ) . Transparent reporting has become increasingly important over the past few years , and several guidance papers have recently been published . Our review indicates that adherence to these guidelines seems partic - ularly urgent for Bayesian data analyses , as controversy around their implementation often relates to the choice of prior distributions . Transparent reporting on prior speciﬁcation could help to partly overcome this M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 12 Table 3 : Reporting Bayesian Analyses in Epidemiological Research Papers Item Category Number Objective Etiologic 49 Prognostic 12 Diagnostic 3 Disease transmission 3 Prevalence / incidence 2 Economic evaluation 1 Design of data collection ∗ Existing registry a 29 ( Longitudinal / pro / - retrospective ) cohort 17 Cross - sectional 9 ( Nested ) case - control 6 Survey 5 ( Multicenter ) RCT 3 Quasi - experiment 1 Statistical model ∗ ( Hierarchical ) regression model b 40 Haplotyping / genotyping / phylogenetics 8 Geostatistical / spatial model 7 Survival model 6 Time - series c 4 Mathematical transmission model 2 Latent class analyses 1 Not reported 2 Type of prior ∗ Uninformative 22 Informative 10 Data driven 4 Not reported 28 Sensitivity analysis on prior Yes 4 Not reported 53 Computations Markov Chain Monte Carlo method 46 Nested Laplace approximation 2 Analytic 0 Not reported 9 Software ∗ WinBUGS / JAGS 24 PHASE , BEAST , MrBayes , Genotyping console 8 R / SAS / Python / Fortran / S - plus 10 bic . glm / MLWin / TLNise 2 Not reported 14 Reporting ∗ Central credibility interval ( CI ) 43 Highest posterior density ( HPD ) 0 Posterior estimate ( unspeciﬁed ) 37 Posterior mean , mode , median ( speciﬁed ) 16 Posterior probabilities 3 Posterior predictive estimates 0 Deviance Information Criterion 10 Bayes Factors 4 Posterior SD / SE , MCerror , Inter - quartile - range 2 Bayesian p - values 1 Not reported 1 ∗ More categories might be applicable ; column totals do not add up to total number of articles . a Census , register , surveillance . b Normal , logistic , Poisson , multinomial , etc . c Distributed lag , discrete time etc . issue . As mentioned , several checklists for reporting on Bayesian analyses are widely available , and they all include items on the reporting of prior speciﬁcation and sensitivity analysis . Additional eﬀorts should be made to increase the awareness of the existence and importance of these checklists among researchers . Un - fortunately , there are no uniform recommendations about the implementation of available guidance papers . M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Bayesian methods for primary data analysis in epidemiological research : a systematic review 13 The reporting quality of papers in the epidemiological and medical literature could therefore be improved more pragmatically by updating existing guidelines ( see for example [ 17 , 18 ] ) to speciﬁcally address issues that are relevant for frequentist and Bayesian data analyses . 4 . 1 Limitations In the current review we only searched a selection of top - 5 ranked epidemiological studies . It could be the case that more studies reporting on primary Bayesian analysis would have been found in subspecialty journals , or that the quality of reporting is diﬀerent is these journals . Additional reviews could provide a wider view on the status of Bayesian statistics in epidemiology , although similar results can be expected , as key journals typically set the landscape for scientiﬁc practice . Furthermore , in the current study we did not focus on ( network ) meta - analysis . We suspect larger numbers of Bayesian analysis might be found within these types of studies , since the implementation of complex statistical models is more feasible in , for example , OpenBUGS . Further research is needed to inventory the status of Bayesian statistics in this area of research . 5 Conclusion Despite the increasing acknowledgement of Bayesian statistics , this review conﬁrmed the underuse of these methods in contemporary epidemiological research . However , the use of Bayesian methods is not as limited as presumed by some authors . Unfortunately , a substantive part of the studies that used Bayesian methods for primary data analysis , provide little information on the process of data analysis , such as prior speciﬁcation and sensitivity analyses . The low quality of reporting is likely to feed to controversy and skepticism around the use of Bayesian techniques , as overt prior speciﬁcation is essential for proper interpretation of research results . Though many checklists for reporting on Bayesian analysis are available , this review revealed that researchers seldom adhere to these guidance papers . We think the use of checklists should be encouraged , and may ultimately improve the reporting on Bayesian methods and the reproducibility of research results . 6 Acknowledgement We would like to thank Fayette Klaassen and Irene Torrubia Ollero for their assistance in searching the literature and coding the included research papers .
