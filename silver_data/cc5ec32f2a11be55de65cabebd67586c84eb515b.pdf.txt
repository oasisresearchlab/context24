The " gold standard " FSC 23 was calculated from two completely independent 3D images reconstructed from the two 24 independent sets of filament images , not from even and odd sets of image segments , to 25 avoid the overlap in images used for analysis . The FSC of the entire structure is shown 26 in the upper panel , and the FSCs for the four different radial regions , as indicated in the 27 inset figure , are shown in the lower panel . The resolutions at FSC = 0 . 143 for the four 28 radial regions are : 5 . 8 Å for 0 – 40 Å ; 5 . 1 Å for 40 – 80 Å ; 5 . 4 Å for 80 – 120 Å ; 8 . 0 Å 29 for 120 – 160 Å . 30 31 32 2 33 Supplementary Figure 2 Comparison of model fit to the cryoEM density map between 34 our rigor model and a rigor - like crystal structure ( PDB : 3I5G ) 1 . The models are 35 displayed in C α ribbon representation . The rigor model is shown in rainbow in the left 36 column , and the rigor - like crystal model in dark orange in the right column . The 37 domains used to fit the rigor - like model are indicated on the left . The residues of each 38 domain used for fitting are : 470 – 560 for L50D ; 320 – 370 for U50D ; and 150 – 200 39 for N25D . 40 3 41 Supplementary Figure 3 Comparison of model fit to the cryoEM density map around 42 the nucleotide - binding site between our rigor model and a rigor - like crystal structure 43 ( PDB : 3I5G ) 1 . The models are displayed in C α ribbon representation . The rigor model 44 is shown in rainbow and the rigor - like crystal model in magenta . Residues 470 – 560 of 45 L50D of the rigor model are used to fit the two models . 46 47 4 48 49 50 Supplementary Figure 4 Comparison of the quality of model fit to cryoEM density 51 map between ours on the left and a previous cryoEM rigor structure ( PDB : 4A7F ; 52 EMDB : EMD - 1987 ) 2 on the right . Red arrows indicate the position of the nucleotide - 53 binding pocket . 54 55 56 5 57 N25D : 1 – 205 loop2 : 624 – 650 58 U50D : 206 – 466 ; 603 – 627 loop3 : 567 – 579 59 L50D : 467 – 602 ; 628 – 680 loop4 : 365 – 379 60 CD : 681 – 770 CM loop : 403 – 417 61 62 63 Supplementary Figure 5 Domains and loops of myosin colored and labeled as a guide . 64 Actin molecules are colored purple . 65 66 67 6 68 Supplementary Figure 6 Comparison of myosin structures in the actomyosin rigor 69 state and in the rigor - like and post - rigor states in crystals . The same four models of 70 myosin in Fig . 5 are shown together with another actomyosin rigor structure by a 71 previous cryoEM study 2 . They are superposed with P - loop - containing strand - helix motif 72 of N25D as in Fig . 4 . The nucleotide - binding sites viewed from the barbed end of actin 73 filament : cryoEM rigor in cyan ; rigor - like ( PDB : 2AKA ) 3 , 4 in magenta ; rigor - like 74 ( 3I5G ) 1 in blue ; post - rigor ( 2MYS ) 5 in orange ; previous cryoEM rigor ( 4A7F ) 2 in green . 75 The small figure with dotted boxes is a guide for an enlarged overview in the middle 76 and a further magnified view at the bottom . Actin subunits are displayed in pink to show 77 the position and orientation of actin filament . Black arrows indicate corresponding parts 78 of the structures between the post - rigor , rigor - like and rigor structures for Switch - 1 and 79 - 2 . 80 7 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 Supplementary Figure 7 Conformational changes of myosin head upon ATP binding 103 as identified by comparison of myosin head structure in the rigor state deduced in this 104 study ( upper panel ) and that of chicken muscle myosin S1 crystal structure ( PDB : 105 2MYS ) 5 regarded as post - rigor ( lower panel ) . The models are viewed perpendicular to 106 the axis of actin filament ( side view as Fig . 1b , c and 6 ) in stereo . 107 108 109 110 8 111 Supplementary Figure 8 Comparison of the cryoEM actomyosin rigor model of rabbit 112 skeletal myosin 2 with that of human myosin - 14 ( PDB : 5JLH ) 6 . Color codes are : actin 113 in hot pink and myosin in magenta for rabbit skeletal myosin 2 ; and actin in blue and 114 myosin in cyan for human myosin - 14 for all the figure panels . ( a ) Actin molecules were 115 superposed for comparison . The interactions between two actin subunits and myosin 116 head are very similar to each other . ( b ) The two models are shown with the cryoEM 117 actomyosin density map of human myosin - 14 . Domain U50D of rabbit skeletal myosin 118 2 ( magenta ) used for superposition with that of human myosin - 14 shows nice fit to the 119 density map , but its domain N25D is out of density ( lower panel ) , indicating distinct 120 difference in these two rigor structures . ( c ) The two models are shown with the cryoEM 121 actomyosin density map of rabbit skeletal myosin 2 . Domain U50D of human myosin - 122 14 ( cyan ) shows nice fit to the density map but its domain N25D is out of density ( upper 123 panel ) , again indicating distinct difference in these two rigor structures . ( c ) Direct 124 comparison of these two models by superposing U50D . The nucleotide - binding pocket 125 indicated by short black arrows in ( b ) and ( c ) is more open in rabbit skeletal myosin 2 126 than human myosin - 14 . 127 9 128 129 Supplementary Figure 9 Conformational changes of rigor myosin head upon ATP 130 binding and its possible consequence to transform into the weak binding state . The 131 structures are all the same as in Fig . 6 but viewed in the opposite direction to show the 132 involvement of myosin loop 2 more clearly . ( a ) ( b ) The actomyosin rigor structure ; ( c ) 133 ( d ) myosin structure upon ATP binding with its L50D helix - loop - helix and loop 2 still 134 attached to actin ; and ( e ) ( f ) after rotation of myosin head to avoid the clash of CM loop 135 with actin where L50D helix - loop - helix and loop 2 still attached to actin . a , b , c are 136 overviews , and b , d , f are magnified . 137 138 139 140 10 141 Supplementary Table 1 : Reconstruction statistics of actin - myosin rigor complex 142 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 143 Number of micrographs 779 144 145 Magnification ×111 , 294 146 147 Pixel size 1 . 348 Å / pixel 148 149 Total number of segmented images 31 , 535 150 in initial selection 151 152 Total number of segmented images 24 , 055 153 154 The number of asymmetric units 117 , 486 155 156 Resolution ( FSC = 0 . 143 ) 5 . 2 Å 157 158 Helical symmetry 159 Translation 27 . 61Å 160 161 Rotation 166 . 67º 162 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 163 164 165 166 167 11 Supplementary Table 2 : The root - mean - square deviations of C α atoms for 168 individual domains of myosin between different models 169 170 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 171 Domain ( ref : 3I5G ) Rigor 2MYS 1QVI 4A7F 5JLH 172 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 173 N25D - 1 1 . 41 1 . 12 0 . 93 1 . 73 1 . 33 ( Å ) 174 ( 12 - 127 ) 175 N25D - 2 0 . 99 0 . 66 0 . 79 3 . 58 1 . 06 176 ( 142 - 197 ) 177 U50D - 1 1 . 35 1 . 98 2 . 02 3 . 30 1 . 93 178 ( 222 - 352 ) 179 U50D - 2 1 . 64 2 . 09 2 . 06 3 . 18 2 . 42 180 ( 364 - 450 ; 606 - 624 ) 181 L50D 1 . 25 0 . 87 2 . 21 4 . 08 1 . 75 182 ( 470 - 490 ; 515 - 601 ; 646 - 666 ) 183 CD 1 . 53 2 . 86 5 . 66 5 . 76 2 . 20 184 ( 666 - 775 ) 185 L50D + CD 1 . 48 3 . 14 16 . 23 7 . 21 1 . 99 186 ( 470 - 490 ; 515 - 601 ; 646 - 775 ) 187 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 188 189 The models compared are : crystal rigor - like model of squid myosin 2 ( PDB : 3I5G ) 1 ; 190 cryoEM rigor model of rabbit skeletal myosin 2 presented in this study ( Rigor ) ; post - 191 rigor model of chicken skeletal myosin 2 ( PDB : 2MYS ) 5 ; pre - power stroke model of 192 scallop myosin 2 ( PDB : 1QVI ) 7 ; cryoEM rigor model of Dictyostelium myosin 1E 193 ( PDB : 4A7F ) 2 ; cryoEM rigor model of human myosin - 14 ( PDB : 5JLH ) 6 . The rms 194 deviations were obtained by using 3I5G as a reference for superposition of individual 195 domains of the other models . The numbers in the parenthesis under each domain 196 indicate regions of amino acid residues . The relatively large rms deviations for CD and 197 L50D + CD of 2MYS and 1QVI indicate the conformational differences in those 198 domains between rigor and post - rigor and between rigor and pre - power stroke . The 199 relatively small rms deviations for domains of cryoEM rigor models of rabbit skeletal 200 myosin 2 ( Rigor ) and human myosin - 14 ( 5JLH ) from those of crystal structures indicate 201 that the models of individual domains of these cryoEM rigor structures were properly 202 refined by fitting them into high quality cryoEM density maps . The relatively large rms 203 deviations of 4A7F ( cryoEM rigor ) from 3I5G ( crystal rigor - like ) suggest that the 204 domains were largely deformed , probably by overfitting of the model to the cryoEM 205 density map . 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 12 213 214 Supplementary Table 3 : The root - mean - square deviations of C α atoms for 215 individual domains of myosin between the cryoEM rigor model of rabbit skeletal 216 myosin II and human cytoplasmic myosin - 14 . 217 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 218 Domain ( ref : 5JLH ) Rigor 219 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 220 N25D - 1 2 . 05 ( Å ) 221 ( 50 - 149 ) 222 N25D - 2 1 . 70 223 ( 164 - 219 ) 224 U50D - 1 2 . 00 225 ( 236 - 364 ) 226 U50D - 2 2 . 18 227 ( 378 - 464 ; 620 - 638 ) 228 L50D 2 . 23 229 ( 485 - 505 ; 530 - 615 ; 669 - 688 ) 230 CD 2 . 26 231 ( 689 - 798 ) 232 L50D + CD 2 . 35 233 ( 485 - 505 ; 530 - 615 ; 669 - 798 ) 234 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 235 236 The models compared are : cryoEM rigor models of human myosin - 14 ( PDB : 5JLH ) 6 237 and rabbit skeletal myosin 2 presented in this study ( Rigor ) . The rms deviations were 238 obtained by using 5JLH as a reference for superposition of individual domains . The 239 numbers in the parenthesis under each domain indicate regions of amino acid residues . 240 The relatively small rms deviations between domains of these two structures indicate 241 that the models of individual domains were properly refined by fitting to high quality 242 cryoEM density maps . 243 244 13 Supplementary References 245 1 Yang , Y . , Gourinath , S . , Kovács , M . , Mitray , L . , Reutzel , R . , Himmel , D .
