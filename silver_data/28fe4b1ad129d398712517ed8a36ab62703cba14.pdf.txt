To date , most analyses aiming at defining 28 the temporal and spatial dynamics of the cytoskeleton have relied on qualitative and quantitative analysis 29 of fluorescence images to describe cytoskeletal function . While state - of - the - art , these approaches have 30 limitations : the diverse shape and brightness of the cytoskeleton cause considerable inaccuracy in both 31 human - driven and automated approaches , and the widely adopted image projection process ( 3D to 2D ) 32 leads to bias and information loss . Here , we describe the development and application of Implicit 33 Laplacian of Enhanced Edge ( ILEE ) , an unguided approach that uses a 2D / 3D - compatible local 34 thresholding algorithm for the quantitative evaluation of cytoskeletal status and organization at high 35 performance . Using ILEE , we constructed a Python library to enable automated cytoskeletal image 36 analysis , providing numerous biologically - interpretable indices measuring the density , bundling , severing , 37 branching , and directionality of the cytoskeleton . The data presented herein demonstrate that ILEE 38 resolves the defects of classic cytoskeleton analysis approaches , enables the measurement of novel 39 cytoskeletal features , and yields quantitatively descriptive data with superior accuracy , stability , and 40 robustness . We released the ILEE algorithm as an open - source library and further developed a Google 41 Colab interface as a community resource . 42 43 Introduction 44 Higher eukaryotes have evolved a complex suite of cellular signaling mechanisms to regulate many 45 biological processes , such as growth , development , movement , reproduction , and response to 46 environmental stimuli . Not surprisingly , to maintain the integration and sustainability of a conceptual 47 signaling network , another “physical network” is deployed as the framework to organize all subcellular 48 structures and the conduit to transport molecules and information 1 – namely , the cytoskeleton . Shared 49 by plants and animals are two types of cytoskeleton , actin and microtubule , which can be generalized as 50 a cytoplasmic web - like matrix , physically integrating the plasma membrane , vesicles , and organelles and 51 functionally connecting the intercellular signaling to the extracellular environments through a highly 52 dynamic series of temporally - and spatially - regulated changes of architecture 2 , 3 . Altogether , the 53 cytoskeleton controls numerous cellular processes such as movement , shaping , cellular trafficking , and 54 intercellular communication 4 . It also provides the mechanical force required for chromosome separation 55 and plasma membrane division during mitosis and meiosis 5 . Besides its role within the cytoplasm , the 56 cytoskeleton also participates in a variety of processes within the nucleus , including RNA polymerase 57 recruitment , transcription initiation , and chromosome scaffolding 6 . 58 59 3 As the cytoskeleton is vital for cell activities and life , the dysfunction of cytoskeletal dynamics generally 60 leads to severe disease . For example , in the development of Alzheimer’s disease , amyloid development 61 triggers the dysregulation of actin dynamics within dendritic spines , leading to synaptotoxicity 7 . Similarly , 62 the dysfunction of microtubule dynamics can trigger neuropsychiatric disorders 8 . In breast cancer , the 63 cancer cell can deploy aberrant actin aggregation to resist cytotoxic natural killer ( NK ) cells from the 64 immune system 9 . In the case of plant diseases , the function of the cytoskeleton is similarly required : 65 recent work has demonstrated that the dynamics of actin and microtubule of the host are specifically 66 manipulated by pathogens to paralyze the plant immunity during the infection 10 . Indeed , the eukaryotic 67 cytoskeleton not only serves as an integrated cell signaling and transportation platform , but also take 68 risks as " a focus of disease development” at the molecular level for human and plants . Hence , 69 understanding the architecture and dynamics of the cytoskeleton is broadly associated with life , health , 70 and food security , attracting significant interests across different fields of biology and beyond . 71 72 Over the past several decades , confocal microscopy - based methods using fluorescence markers have 73 been developed to monitor changes in cytoskeletal organization 11 . While showing advantages in real - 74 time observation and intuitive visual presentation , these approaches possess critical limitations – namely , 75 they are subject to human interpretation , and as a result , often suffer from bias . As a step to reduce such 76 limitation ( s ) , the emergence of computational , algorithm - based analyses offers a solution to describe the 77 quantitative features of cytoskeletal architecture with reduced human bias . However , while early studies 78 introduced the concept of using generalizable image processing pipelines 12 , 13 to transfer the task of 79 evaluation away from the user and into a series of computer - based quantitative indices , several key 80 bottlenecks were still prevalent . First , most of the quantitative algorithms that have been described to 81 date are limited to 2D images . As a result , these approaches require users to manually generate z - axis 82 projections from raw data , a process that results in an incredible amount of information loss , especially 83 within the perpendicular portion of the cytoskeleton . Second , many current approaches require users to 84 set thresholds manually to segment cytoskeletal components from the images , a task that results in 85 sampling bias . Lastly , the performance of existing algorithms varies significantly depending on the sample 86 source . This hurdle imposes a considerable disparity in the algorithm performance for plants – which 87 possess a dominance of curvy and fluctuating filaments – compared to the animal cytoskeletal 88 organization , which is generally straight and complanate 14 – 16 . In fact , while sample source dramatically 89 impacts our ability to evaluate the features of cytoskeletal function across all eukaryotes , the vast majority 90 of current approaches are developed based on cytoskeletal images from animal cells , which indicates 91 potential systemic bias when applied to other types of image samples , such as plants . 92 93 4 Previous work has described the development of a global - thresholding - based pipeline to define and 94 evaluate two key features of cytoskeleton filament organization in living plant cells : cytoskeletal density , 95 defined by occupancy , and bundling , defined by statistical skewness of fluorescence 17 . While this 96 approach utilizes manual global thresholding ( MGT ) , which can potentially introduce a certain level of 97 user bias , it still outperforms most standardized adaptive / automatic global or local thresholding 98 approaches , such as Otsu 18 and Niblack 19 . More recent advances in MGT - based approaches , such as 99 those by Higaki and colleagues , include additional analysis indices , such as the introduction of coefficient 100 of variation ( CV ) of fluorescence to quantify the degree of filament bundling – an improvement that 101 advances the overall robustness and utility of the original algorithm 20 . However , this analysis pipeline still 102 consumes a considerable amount of time and effort from users for massive sample processing and leaves 103 unaddressed two critical issues of rigor in image processing and analysis : information loss and human 104 bias . 105 106 In the current study , we developed implicit Laplacian of enhanced edge ( ILEE ) , a 2D / 3D compatible 107 unguided local thresholding algorithm for cytoskeletal segmentation and analysis , which is based on the 108 native brightness , first - order derivative ( i . e . , gradient ) , and second - order derivative ( i . e . , Laplacian ) of the 109 cytoskeleton image altogether ( see Fig . 1 ) . The study described herein supports ILEE as a superior image 110 quantitative analytic platform that overcomes current limitations such as information loss through 111 dimensional reduction , human bias , and inter - sample instability . As shown , ILEE can accurately 112 recognize cytoskeleton from images with a high variation of filament brightness and thickness , such as 113 live plant samples . 114 115 As a key advance in the development of ILEE , we constructed an ILEE - based Python library , namely 116 ILEE _ CSK , for the fully automated quantitative analysis of cytoskeleton images . In order to improve 117 ILEE _ CSK’s capability to explore the features of cytoskeleton , we proposed several novel indices – linear 118 density , diameter _ TDT , diameter _ STD , static severing activity , and static branching activity to 119 enable / enhance the measurement of ( de - ) / polymerization , bundling , severing , and branching dynamics 120 of the cytoskeleton . Together with other classic indices transplanted from other studies , ILEE _ CSK totally 121 supports 12 cytoskeletal indices within 5 primary classes : density , bundling , connectivity , branching , and 122 directionality . Our data suggested that ILEE outcompetes other classic algorithms by its superior 123 accuracy , stability , and robustness over the computation of cytoskeleton indices . Furthermore , we 124 provided evidence demonstrating higher fidelity and reliability of 3D - based cytoskeletal computational 125 approaches over traditional 2D - based approaches . In addition , using a series of experiment - based 126 images from pathogen - infected plant cells , we demonstrated that ILEE has an improved sensitivity to 127 5 distinguish biological differences and owns the potential to reveal novel biological features previously 128 omitted due to insufficient approaches . In sum , this platform not only enables the efficient acquisition and 129 evaluation of key actin filament parameters with high accuracy from both projected 2D and native 3D 130 images , but also enables accessibility to a broader range of cytoskeletal status for biological interpretation . 131 132 The library , ILEE _ CSK , is publicly released at GitHub ( https : / / phylars . github . io / ILEE _ CSK / ) . We also 133 developed the ILEE Google Colab pipelines for data processing , visualization , and statistical analysis , 134 which is a convenient and user - friendly interface that requires no programing experience or particular 135 computational device . 136 137 Results 138 The ILEE pipeline 139 Raw images generated by laser scanning confocal microscopy are typically obtained through detecting 140 in - focus photons by a sensor from each resolution unit on a given focal plane . Since the cytoskeleton is 141 a 3D structure that permeates throughout the cell , current approaches used to capture the filament 142 architecture rely on scanning the pixels of each plane along the z - axis at a given depth of step ; finally , 143 these stacks are reconstructed to yield a 3D image . However , due to limited computational biological 144 resources , most studies have exclusively employed the z - axis - projected 2D image , which results in 145 substantial information loss and systemic bias in downstream analyses . 146 147 In our newly developed algorithm , we integrated both 2D and 3D data structures into the same processing 148 pipeline to ameliorate the aforementioned conflict ( Fig . 1a ) . In short , this pipeline enabled automatic 149 processing and evaluation of both traditional 2D and native 3D z - stack image analysis . As shown in Fig . 150 1b , cytoskeleton segmentation using ILEE requires three inputs : an edge - enhanced image , a global 151 gradient threshold that recognizes the edges of potential cytoskeletal components , and the Laplacian 152 smoothing coefficient K ( described below ) . With these inputs , a local threshold image is generated via 153 ILEE , and the pixels / voxels with values above the threshold image at the same coordinates are classified 154 as cytoskeletal components . The output of this is the generation of the binary image ( Fig . 1c ) . Once 155 acquired , the binary image is further skeletonized 21 to enable the downstream calculation of numerous 156 cytoskeleton indices , the sum of which comprises the quantitative features of cytoskeletal dynamics ( Fig . 157 1c ) . Additionally , because the 2D and 3D modes share a common workflow , all of the calculated 158 cytoskeleton indices also share the definition for both modes , regardless of the difference in dimensional 159 spaces . This additional feature enables a horizontal comparison of both modes by the user , which we 160 assert will significantly contribute to the community by providing massive image datasets for further 161 6 examination and comparison through the open - source library . In general , the ultimate goal of this 162 approach , and resultant algorithm , is to construct a pipeline that enables the automated detection of the 163 eukaryotic cytoskeleton from complex biological images in an accurate and unbiased manner . 164 165 Image decomposition and processing strategy 166 One of the central problems of automated cytoskeletal image processing is how to accurately recognize 167 cytoskeletal components – a task that is highly challenging because object pixels ( i . e . , cytoskeleton 168 components ) generally have a high dynamic range of signal intensity within and among individual 169 samples , due to varied bundle thickness , concentration of fluorescent dye , and its binding efficiency . As 170 a framework to further understand this challenge , an image from confocal microscopy is conceptually 171 comprised of three components : ( 1 ) the true fluorescence , that which is emitted by the dye molecules 172 within the pixel , ( 2 ) the diffraction signal transmitted from neighboring space , and ( 3 ) the ground noise 173 generated by the sensor of the imaging system ( Fig . 2a ) . During confocal imaging , the ground noise 174 fluctuates around a constant due to the fixed setting of photon sensors , while the diffraction signal is 175 positively correlated with the local true fluorescence . Therefore , an ideal cytoskeleton segregation 176 algorithm will be an adaptive local thresholding approach that refers to both ground noise and local signal 177 intensity . 178 179 Identification of coarse background 180 To identify the approximate level of the ground noise for downstream fine thresholding , a general strategy 181 is to define a highly representative “feature value” of ground noise , based on which a global threshold 182 can be estimated to segment the “coarse background” . Guided by this strategy , we designed an algorithm 183 that calculates a global threshold using the morphological features of the ground noise – namely , non - 184 connected negative element scanning ( NNES ; Fig . 2b ) . In brief , NNES scans the total number of non - 185 connected negative elements at different global thresholds , resulting in the identification of the 186 representative value ( i . e . , the peak ) with a maximum non - connected negative element count ( Fig . 2b , ( i ) ) . 187 The global threshold for the coarse background ( Fig . 2b , ( iii ) ) will be determined using a linear model 188 trained by the representative value rendered by NNES and manual global thresholding ( MGT ) , a global 189 threshold determined by researchers experienced in manual cytoskeleton image analysis ( Supplemental 190 Fig . 1 and 2 ) . NNES can maintain stability and accuracy over different samples that vary in the brightness 191 distribution , because ground noise is the image component with the lowest value that is subject to a 192 normal distribution and generally does not interfere with the actual fluorescence signal . Another 193 accessible method is to directly use the peak - of - frequency brightness of the image as a representative 194 value to train a model . However , this approach is less accurate because the interval near the theoretical 195 7 peak is always turbulent and non - monotone , a limitation potentially due to the pollution of diffracted light 196 ( Supplemental Fig . 1 ; also see Discussion ) . 197 198 Cytoskeleton segmentation by ILEE 199 The core strategy of ILEE is to accurately identify the edge of all cytoskeletal filament components and 200 apply an implicit Laplacian smoothing 22 on the selected edge . This leads to the generation of a threshold 201 image where high gradient areas ( i . e . , the edge of cytoskeleton filaments ) smoothly transit to each other 202 ( Fig . 3a ) . As illustrated in Supplemental Fig . 3a , the general local threshold trend changes as a function 203 of the baseline values of the cytoskeleton edges . This is because ILEE selectively filters out high - 204 frequency noise while preserving salient geometric features of individual actin filaments by leveraging 205 the spectral characteristics of Laplacian operators ( Supplemental Fig . 3b , c ) . Thus , ILEE can filter the 206 background and noise regardless of the general local brightness level , demonstrating that its function 207 does not require an operating kernel which would otherwise restrict the performance when evaluating 208 filaments of varying thickness . Moreover , the edge of the cytoskeletal component can be smoothed and 209 elongated using a significant difference filter ( SDF ; Supplemental Fig . 4 ) and a Gaussian filter , the sum 210 of which serves to enhance the continuity of the edge and contributes to the accuracy of edge detection 211 ( Fig . 1b and 3a ) . For this reason , we name our algorithm as indicated as “Implicit Laplacian of Enhanced 212 Edge” 213 214 For computation , the ILEE algorithm builds a linear system based on Laplacian operators to achieve local 215 adaptive thresholding for edges of cytoskeletal components ( see Methods for detail ) . In brief , we first 216 used the information from the coarse background to estimate a global threshold of the gradient magnitude 217 ( (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) ) , and classified pixels / voxels above (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) as boundary elements ( (cid:1835) (cid:3032)(cid:3031)(cid:3034)(cid:3032) ) ( Fig . 3a , 2 . 1 ) . Following 218 the boundary identification , we constructed a (cid:1866) × (cid:1866) ( (cid:1866) is the total number of pixel / voxel in the image ) 219 selection matrix S , a sparse diagonal matrix whose diagonal corresponds to the flattened pixel / voxel in 220 order ; the diagonal element was 1 if the pixel / voxel possessed a norm of the gradient above (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) . As 221 the pixels / voxels belonging to the boundary of the cytoskeleton filament were marked , (cid:1835) (cid:3032)(cid:3031)(cid:3034)(cid:3032) can be 222 mathematically defined as shown in Fig . 3a , equations 2 . 2 . 1 and 2 . 2 . 2 , where L is the Laplacian matrix 223 and K , or implicit Laplacian smoothing coefficient , is a weight that adjusts the influence of the Laplacian 224 operator . The local threshold image can therefore be rendered by solving the linear equation shown in 225 Fig . 3b , 2 . 2 . 3 . 226 227 For a given image input , the performance of ILEE depends on two parameters : (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) , which defines the 228 edge , and K , which determines the weight of detail ( i . e . , high - frequency components ) to be filtered . To 229 8 calculate the (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) for an input image , we used brightness values of the area identified as coarse 230 background by NNES . Since the ground noise is approximately subject to a normal distribution , we 231 hypothesized a deducible statistical relationship between the image gradient , defined by Scharr 232 operator 23 , and the native brightness of pixels / voxels within the coarse background . Using a normal 233 random array that simulates the noise with a 2D or 3D data structure , we demonstrate that the distribution 234 of the background gradient magnitude is also normal - like , and both mean ( (cid:2020) (cid:3008) ) and standard deviation 235 ( (cid:2026) (cid:3008) ) of the gradients are directly proportional to the standard deviation of their native pixel values ( (cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) ) , 236 and we calculate the proportionality coefficient ( see Supplemental Fig . 5 ) . For the 3D mode , since the 237 voxel size on the x - and y - axis is different from that of the z - axis , the proportionality coefficient of (cid:2020) (cid:3008) and 238 (cid:2026) (cid:3008) over (cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) will vary for different ratios of the x - y unit : z unit ( see Supplemental Fig . 6 ) . To solve this 239 problem , we simulated artificial 3D noise images and trained a multi - interval regression model that 240 accurately ( R 2 > 0 . 999 ) calculates the proportionality coefficient of (cid:2020) (cid:3008) and (cid:2026) (cid:3008) over (cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) for different x - y : 241 z ratios of the voxel . Finally , using this approach and randomly selected actin image samples , we trained 242 a model , (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) = (cid:2020) (cid:3008) + (cid:1863)(cid:3435)(cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) (cid:3439) ∗ (cid:2026) (cid:3008) , to determine the (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) as ILEE input ( Supplemental Fig . 7 ) . 243 244 To determine the appropriate setting of K , we first tested how different K values influenced the result of 245 the local threshold image ( (cid:1835) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) of Fig . 3a ) . As shown in Supplemental Figure 8a , at the optimal (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) , 246 a low value of K generated an (cid:1835) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) that was highly consistent with the selected edge ; when K increases , 247 the total threshold image shifted towards the average value of the selected edges with increasing loss of 248 detail . As for the resultant binary image , a lower K enables the accurate recognition of thin and faint actin 249 filament components , yet cannot cover the entire width of thick filaments . Conversely , a high K value 250 covers thick actin filaments with improved accuracy , resulting in a binary image that is less noisy ; however , 251 thin and / or faint filaments tend to be omitted as pseudo - negative pixels ( Fig . 3b , Supplemental Fig . 8a ) . 252 To overcome this dilemma , we applied a strategy using a lower (cid:1837) (cid:2869) and a higher (cid:1837) (cid:2870) to compute two 253 different binary images that focus on thin / faint components and thick components , respectively . Then , 254 we generated a full outer - join image that contains all cytoskeleton components in these two binary images . 255 This approach led to improved recognition of cytoskeleton with varying morphologies ( see Fig . 3b ) . 256 257 As described above , K 1 controls the performance of thin and faint filaments . Since the theoretical 258 minimum thickness of a distinguishable cytoskeletal component is approximately equal to one pixel / voxel 259 unit , (cid:1837) (cid:2869) can be fixed to a constant to recognize the finest cytoskeletal components from a complex and 260 heterogeneous set of input samples . Using this approach , we identified an empirical optimal (cid:1837) (cid:2869) of 2 . 5 . 261 However , since different image samples have different distributions of cytoskeleton thickness , (cid:1837) (cid:2870) , which 262 9 controls the performance over thick filaments , must be guided according to the maximum thickness 263 among all samples in an experiment batch . To ensure that the algorithm described herein is fully unguided , 264 our strategy was to estimate an appropriate (cid:1837) (cid:2870) from an estimated maximum thickness using all samples 265 from a single batch of experiments , including multiple biological replicates ( if applicable ) . To do this , we 266 used Niblack thresholding first to generate a coarse binary image ( which is sufficiently accurate for the 267 thickest portion of the filament ) ; from this , we calculated the mean of the top 5 % of the Euclidian distance 268 transformation ( DT ) values of all positive pixels ( see Methods for additional information ) . Next , the top 5 % 269 means of all individual images were averaged to estimate (cid:1837) (cid:2870) via a trained model using a sample set with 270 manual portraited binary ground truth ( Fig . 3c and Supplemental Fig . 8b , c , d ) . Therefore , individual 271 images from all groups in the same batch of an experiment can be processed by (cid:1837) (cid:2870) as estimated using 272 the model above . In this , the bias of human input was avoided . When processing 3D images , we 273 additionally provided a parameter that allows using a single (cid:1837) , rather than (cid:1837) (cid:2869) and (cid:1837) (cid:2870) , which balances the 274 accuracy over thin / faint and thick / bright filaments while saving certain amount of time of computation . 275 276 Computational analysis of cytoskeleton indices 277 Through the image processing pipeline , cytoskeletal indices were automatically calculated from the 278 binary image generated by ILEE . As a substantial expansion from three previously defined cytoskeletal 279 indices ( e . g . , occupancy , skewness , and CV ) 17 , 20 , we totally introduced 12 indices ( Fig . 1a ) ; particularly , 280 we focused on 9 of the 12 indices in this study , as they are normalized and ready for biological 281 interpretation ( see Supplementary Fig . 9 for visualized demonstration for each index ) . These indices fall 282 within five classes – density , bundling , connectivity , branching , and directionality , which describe the 283 quantifiable features and functions of cytoskeletal morphology and dynamics . It is worth noting that many 284 of these indices require a certain level of image post - processing ( e . g . , oversampling ) to further enhance 285 the accuracy of the output . The detailed mathematical definition of each index is described in Methods . 286 287 We have defined a novel set of cytoskeletal indices to enable the measurement of certain cytoskeletal 288 features . For the class “density” , we developed linear density , a feature that measures filament length 289 per unit of 2D / 3D space . For the class “bundling” , we developed two new highly robust indices , referred 290 to as diameter by total DT ( diameter _ TDT ) and diameter by skeleton DT ( diameter _ SDT ) . Both of them 291 quantify the physical thickness of filament bundles , in addition to the indirect indices skewness and CV , 292 which estimate the relative bundling level based on the statistical distribution of fluorescence intensity . 293 For the class “connectivity” , we defined static severing activity , which estimates the severing events within 294 per length unit of the cytoskeleton . static severing activity assumes that a severing event generates two 295 visible cytoskeletal filaments , which is distinguishable from filament depolymerization . This is an 296 10 important consideration in terms of the biological behavior of the cytoskeleton , as it enables the 297 decoupling of the impact of filament depolymerization and filament severing , key activities facilitated by 298 the eukaryotic actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) and cofilin family of proteins 24 . For the class “branching” , 299 our algorithm is based on Skan , a recently developed Python library for the graph - theoretical analysis of 300 the cytoskeleton 25 . To further explore the relationship between filament morphology and the biological 301 activity of branching , we specifically designed a novel index , static branching activity , which we define as 302 the total number of additional branches emerging from any non - end - point node in per unit length of 303 filament . In total , this index measures the abundance / frequency of cytoskeletal branching . Finally , our 304 library supports estimating the level of directional cytoskeletal growth by the index local anisotropy , which 305 measures how local filaments tend to be directional or chaotic . This approach is transplanted from an 306 ImageJ plug - in FibrilTool 26 , but we expanded this algorithm to 3D space ( Fig . 1c ) . 307 308 It is noteworthy that we named the two indices describing severing and branching above as “ static” 309 severing activity and “ static” branching activity , because , by the most rigorous mathematical criteria , a 310 dynamic status cannot be directly defined without introducing the time dimension . However , the 311 introduction of time dimension ( using a video sample ) generally sacrifices spatial resolution due to the 312 technical limit of microscopy devices . While it is available to use TIRF ( total internal reflection 313 fluorescence microscopy ) or VAEM ( variable - angle epifluorescence microscopy ) to collect 2D videos 27 , 314 such methods may be limited by the insufficient quantity of filaments in the field of vision and manual 315 counting of the dynamic events , both of which may introduce bias compared to a larger 3D data structure . 316 Alternatively , we introduce static severing activity and static branching activity as indirect indices 317 measuring the intensity of severing and branching . Here , we assume that the occurrence of 318 severing / branching events and the net regeneration speed of cytoskeleton has established ( or is very 319 near to ) their dynamic equilibrium ; at this point , the quantity of pieces / branches of the filament is positively 320 correlated to the speed of severing and branching . In practice , most experimental schemes set an interval 321 between the treatment ( if any ) and imaging , which is long enough to reach the dynamic equilibrium . 322 Therefore , we expect these two novel indices can provide interpretable and reliable data to estimate the 323 intensity of severing and branching , especially for confocal images . 324 325 ILEE displays high accuracy and stability over actin image samples . 326 To evaluate the performance of ILEE in terms of its accuracy and compatibility over diverse samples , we 327 selected a dataset of actin images from Arabidopsis leaves with diverse morphology , and compared ILEE 328 with numerous traditional global and local thresholding algorithms , including MGT . First , to evaluate the 329 accuracy of each algorithm in terms of filament segregation , we manually generated the ground truth 330 11 binary image from each of the samples using a digital drawing monitor ( Fig . 4a , ground truth ) . Next , we 331 used each ground truth binary image as a reference and compared the filament architecture obtained by 332 ILEE , MGT , and 6 additional adaptive thresholding algorithms . These additional thresholding algorithms 333 include Otsu 18 , Triangle 28 , Li 29 , Yan 30 , Niblack 19 , and Sauvola 31 ( Fig . 4 ) . As an additional concern of rigor , 334 we anticipated that pseudo - positive pixels may be obtained due to operator’s bias during the generation 335 of each of the ground truth images ( even when the operator is experienced in the actin imaging field ) . 336 Therefore , we further analyzed each non - connected component of pseudo - positive pixel by its shape and 337 connectivity to the matched elements and identified the actin - like pseudo - positive pixels as possible real 338 actin components . 339 340 As shown in Fig . 4a ( visualized demonstration ) , 4b ( quantitative analysis ) , and 4c ( bias analysis ) , ILEE 341 offers superior performance , with improved accuracy , reduced pseudo - positive / negative occurrence , and 342 the lowest bias over local filament thickness compared to current approaches . It is noteworthy , however , 343 that the adaptive global thresholding approaches ( from Otsu to Yan ) tend to be relatively accurate when 344 judging the thick and bright bundles of the cytoskeleton . However , these approaches are unable to 345 capture faint filaments , and as a result , generate a high pseudo - negative rate . Conversely , both adaptive 346 local thresholding approaches , Niblack and Sauvola , generate numerous block - shaped pseudo - positive 347 elements , and fail to capture the near - edge region of thick filaments . For MGT and Li method , although 348 they showed satisfactory match rate and lower averaged pseudo - positive / negative rates , their 349 performance is far less stable than ILEE ( Fig . 4b ) . 350 351 As a next step , we evaluated the accuracy and stability of cytoskeletal indices using ILEE versus other 352 commonly used imaging algorithms . To do this , we first computed the ground truth indices from the 353 manually generated binary images ; then , quantitative measurements were collected from all methods 354 and normalized by the relative fold to the result generated from the corresponding ground truth image . 355 As shown in Fig . 4d , ILEE showed the best overall accuracy and cross - sample stability compared to all 356 other quantitative approaches , the highest accuracy for occupancy , skewness , CV , and diameter _ TDT . 357 However , we did observe that in terms of the morphology - sensitive indices ( i . e . , linear density , severing 358 activity , and branching activity ) , the ILEE algorithm did not fully conform with data collected from the 359 ground truth binary images . Upon further inspection , we determined that this is because the manually 360 portrayed ground truth images and ILEE results showed different tendencies in judging the pixels in the 361 narrow areas between two bright filaments ( see Discussion ) . While other approaches displayed obvious , 362 somewhat predictable , inaccuracies , the MGT and Li methods still generated satisfactory results , which 363 12 echoes their performance in actin segmentation . However , the performance of these two algorithms 364 among diverse and complex biological samples was not as stable as ILEE . 365 366 In order to further evaluate the stability and robustness of ILEE performance , we continued to analyze 367 the variance coefficient of all groups ( Supplemental Fig . 10 ) , uncovering that ILEE is the only approach 368 that simultaneously maintained high accuracy and stability . Next , we tested the robustness of ILEE and 369 other approaches against noise signal disturbance by adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the 370 image dataset ( Supplemental Figs . 11 - 13 ) . Using this approach , we observed that ILEE is still the best 371 performing algorithm , maintaining stable and accurate image binarization and cytoskeleton indices 372 against increasing noise . Taken together , these results demonstrate that ILEE has superior accuracy , 373 stability , and robustness over MGT and other classic automated image thresholding approaches in terms 374 of both cytoskeleton segmentation and index computation . 375 376 3D ILEE preserves more information and gains higher fidelity over 2D ILEE . 377 While the 2D ILEE generally outcompetes MGT and other commonly used automated algorithms ( Fig . 378 4 ) , the comparison of cytoskeleton segmentation approaches using the manually portraited ground truth 379 is currently limited to 2D images , because it is extremely difficult and error - prone to select the “3D ground 380 truth” voxel by voxel . However , as the 3D mode theoretically preserves information from the z - axis and 381 renders higher accuracy , it is necessary to circumvent the challenge and verify these merits . Therefore , 382 we turned to a different strategy using synthetic artificial 3D actin images with certain ground truth to 383 investigate the performance of 3D versus 2D mode ( Fig . 5a ) . 384 385 First , we constructed an actin image simulation model , which mimics three different fractions of image 386 brightness ( real actin , ground noise , and diffraction noise ; see Fig . 2a ) using three independent statistical 387 solutions ( Supplemental Fig . 19 ; also see Methods ) . In brief , we utilized a training dataset of 31 diverse 388 3D samples to generalize the principles that describe the position - based brightness distributions of the 389 voxels for the three fractions independently . Next , we adopted only the skeleton image generated by 3D 390 ILEE from the training samples as the topological frame and refilled the whole image with new brightness 391 values via the actin image simulation model . The advantage of this , rather than generating it de novo , 392 was to ensure that the topological structure of the artificial filaments maximumly mimic the shape of 393 genuine actin . Accordingly , we generated 31 3D artificial images and processed them using the ILEE 2D 394 and 3D modes . 395 396 13 Our primary question was how 3D ILEE structurally improves the information loss through the 2D pipeline , 397 and moreover , yields improved accuracy of the cytoskeletal indices . As shown in Fig . 5b , we observed 398 that the 2D pipeline resulted in considerable information loss with reduced accuracy . Indeed , while the 399 3D segmentation almost accurately covers the filament voxels , the 2D pipeline only captured 8 % of the 400 data points as pixels and 42 % of the total length of filaments , suggesting potentially biased sampling . 401 Consequently , 3D ILEE generally gains index values closer to the ground truth than 2D ILEE , which 402 indicates the 3D mode indeed possesses a better absolute accuracy / fidelity . 403 404 In some scenarios , studies are interested in the relative difference between experimental groups for 405 biological interpretations , rather than the absolute accuracy of quantifiable features . Therefore , we also 406 measured the “comparative sensitivity” of 3D and 2D ILEE , which reflects their capability to determine 407 relatively high and low index values . To learn this , the index values of the ground truth images , as well 408 as those computed through 3D and 2D modes , were first normalized to the fold to the minimum value of 409 the corresponding group , followed by linear correlation analysis between the ground truth and ILEE 410 outputs of each sample . As shown in Fig . 5c , the 3D mode has a higher correlation for seven of the nine 411 indices , among which diameter ( TDT ) , static severing activity , and anisotropy got a considerable 412 improvement . Interestingly , we observed that the 2D mode performed slightly better for indices of the 413 density class ( e . g . , occupancy and linear density ) . We posit that this is because z - axis projection may 414 increase the contrast between samples with low and high filament density . In conclusion , our data 415 suggest that the 3D mode of ILEE indeed eliminates the issues related to image projection and provides 416 reliable results with higher accuracy and comparative sensitivity . 417 418 ILEE leads to the discovery of new features of actin dynamics in response to bacteria . 419 The primary impetus for creating the ILEE algorithm was to develop a method to define cytoskeleton 420 organization from complex samples , including those during key transitions in cellular status . For example , 421 previous research has demonstrated that the activation of immune signaling is associated with specific 422 changes in cytoskeletal organization 27 , 32 – 34 . Complementary to these studies , other research identified 423 the temporal and spatial induction of changes in the cytoskeletal organization as a function of the 424 pathogen ( e . g . , Pseudomonas syringae ) infection and disease development 35 – 37 . The sum of these 425 studies , which broadly applied MGT - based quantitative analysis of cytoskeleton architecture , concluded 426 that virulent bacterial infection triggers elevated density ( by occupancy ) yet induced no changes in 427 filament bundling ( by skewness ) in the early stages of infection . Since one of our major motivations herein 428 was to develop an ILEE - based toolkit – supported by novel cytoskeletal indices – to investigate the 429 process of pathogen infection and immune signaling activation , we collected raw data from a previous 430 14 study 34 describing a bacterial infection experiment using Arabidopsis expressing an actin fluorescence 431 marker ( i . e . , GFP - fABD2 ) , followed by confocal imaging and data analysis by ILEE as well as MGT 432 conducted by three independent operators with rich experience in actin quantificational analysis ( Fig . 6 ) . 433 Additionally , because researchers sometimes apply a universal global threshold to all images from a 434 batch of biological experiments to avoid tremendous labor consumption , we included this approach and 435 aimed to observe its performance as well . In this experiment , the only categorical variant is whether 436 sampled plants are treated with bacteria ( EV ) or not ( mock ) . In total , nine indices that cover features of 437 density , bundling , severing , branching , and directional order are measured and compared . 438 439 Our first question is whether the operator’s bias generated by MGT will influence the result and conclusion 440 generalized from the experiment . We thereby analyzed the correlation of MGT results set by the three 441 operators and found only a weak correlation between different operators ( Fig . 6b ) , which indicates MGT 442 indeed introduces bias and potentially impacts quantitative results . Interestingly , while minor statistical 443 discrepancies between MGTs by different operators are found in some indices ( i . e . , skewness and 444 severing activity ) , most of the MGT results ( both adaptive or fixed ) shows the same trend as 2D ILEE , 445 yet with far higher standard deviation , or lower stability ( Supplemental Fig . 14a ) over a certain biological 446 treatment . This indicates that the historical data based on MGT should be majorly trustworthy despite the 447 biased single data points , but an accurate conclusion must be based on a high sampling number that 448 hedges the deviation of individual data points . Since ILEE gains less systemic error over biological 449 repeats , we also tested whether ILEE renders higher statistical power to identify potential significant 450 differences . As suggested by Supplemental Fig . 14b , we that ILEE indeed has the lowest p - values among 451 t - tests conducted for indices with a trend of difference . We believe these advantages demonstrate ILEE 452 as a better choice for actin quantification . 453 454 Next , we attempted to understand whether different indices of the same class , particularly density and 455 bundling , can reflect the quantitative level of the class in accordance , or instead show inconsistency . For 456 density , we correlated the occupancy and linear density values of all methods over actin images of both 457 mock and EV groups , and found that occupancy and linear density measurements are in high conformity , 458 with a Pearson coefficient at 0 . 98 ( Supplemental Fig . 15 ) . For bundling indices , we were interested in 459 their level of conformity because direct indices ( based on binary shape ) and indirect indices ( based on 460 brightness frequency distribution ) are entirely different strategies to measure bundling . Using the same 461 approach of correlation analysis , we found that diameter _ TDT and diameter _ SDT display strong positive 462 correlation , while skewness and CV have merely medium - low correlation , which echoes the previous 463 report demonstrating skewness and CV have different performance on the bundling evaluation 20 . 464 15 Unexpectedly , we also found that CV ( as a representative of indirect indices ) and diameter - SDT ( as a 465 representative of direct indices ) have a striking zero correlation . This is perplexing , as it raises the 466 question on whether skewness or CV should be regarded as an accurate measurement of bundling ( see 467 Discussion ) . This discrepancy is also observed by 3D ILEE , whose CV and diameter - SDT over mock 468 versus EV revealed the converse results at significant differences . In general , we believe the biological 469 conclusion that Pst DC3000 treatment renders increased actin bundling should be reconsidered with 470 further inspection . 471 472 Lastly , we asked if additional features of plant actin cytoskeletal dynamics in response to virulent bacterial 473 infection can be identified by the newly introduced indices and enhanced performance of ILEE . As shown 474 in Fig . 6 , we observed significantly regulated static severing activity , local anisotropy , and static branching 475 activity triggered by the bacteria . At a minimum , these discoveries potentially lead to new biological 476 interpretations , and as a result , may contribute to the identification of additional immune - regulated 477 processes as a function of actin dynamics . However , while most 2D approaches were consistent and in 478 agreement with the other indices , the static severing activity estimated by 3D ILEE indicates a significant 479 but opposite conclusion . As suggested by the ground truth - based comparison on accuracy between 3D 480 and 2D ILEE ( Fig . 5 ) , we believed this discrepancy was due to the information loss and misinterpretation 481 by z - axis projection during the 2D pipeline . Hence , we have higher general confidence in the results and 482 conclusion by the 3D mode . 483 484 ILEE has broad compatibility with various sample types 485 Cytoskeleton imaging from live plant samples is arguably one of the most challenging types of images to 486 evaluate due to the dynamic topology and uneven brightness of actin filaments . While we demonstrated 487 that ILEE shows superior performance over plant actin samples , ILEE and the ILEE _ CSK library are 488 generally designed for non - specific confocal images of the cytoskeleton , therefore applicable to other 489 types of samples . To investigate the compatibility of ILEE to other types of image samples , we tested 490 ILEE on both plant microtubules 38 and animal cell actin images ( Supplemental Fig . 16 ) . Importantly , we 491 found that ILEE and ILEE _ CSK library can process both plant and animal images with satisfying 492 performance . This is encouraging , as ILEE can substitute or improve Hough transform , a straight - line 493 detection algorithm commonly used for animal cytoskeleton ( generally straight and thick ) , but with some 494 limitation in neglecting and miscalculating curvy cytoskeleton fractions 14 , 15 . With the advancement of ILEE , 495 Hough transform - based analysis may not be essential , and the potential cytoskeleton indices that 496 rigorously require Hough transform can still utilize ILEE as a provider of binary image input for more 497 accurate results . 498 16 Discussion 499 We describe the creation of ILEE , an accurate and robust filament segregation algorithm for the unguided 500 quantitative analysis of the organization of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton . As presented , this approach 501 supports the in vivo analysis of both 2D and native 3D data structures , enabling an unbiased evaluation 502 of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics . In addition to the development of key methods , we also 503 generated a publicly available Python library that supports the automated computation of 12 filament 504 indices of 5 classes of morphological features of the cytoskeleton . As described above , our data indicate 505 that ILEE shows superior accuracy , robustness , and stability over existing cytoskeleton image analysis 506 algorithms , including the widely adapted MGT approaches 17 , 39 . As a result of these newly developed 507 approaches , we have developed an open - access library to conduct ILEE based cytoskeleton analysis , 508 which eliminates limitations imposed by the classic 2D MGT approaches , including the introduction of 509 user bias and different types of information loss . 510 511 Robustness of NNES - based prediction of global gradient thresholds 512 The gradient threshold ( (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) ) defines the selected edge of actin filaments for implicit Laplacian 513 transformation , the appropriateness of which greatly determines the performance of ILEE . To calculate 514 (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) without imposing a user - biased input , our strategy utilized specific feature values collected from 515 the NNES curve and human - guided MGT to train a prediction model for the rapid rendering of a coarse 516 area of the image background . Through this approach , we were able to deduce the corresponding (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) 517 by the mathematical relationship between the statistical distribution of the native pixel values and Scharr 518 gradient magnitude of the coarse background ( Supplemental Figs . 5 , 6 , 7 , and Methods ) . This step might 519 first appear unnecessary , since , alternatively , the most straight - forward strategy was to directly train a 520 prediction model using the image gradient histogram and the human - determined (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) . However , as the 521 gradient operator ( see Methods ) for any given object pixel is influenced by the values of surrounding 522 pixels , the calculated gradient on the edge of the background is highly impacted ( overestimated ) by the 523 contrast of foreground ( cytoskeleton ) versus the background . In other words , the brightness frequency 524 distribution of the background gradient will change at elevated cytoskeleton fluorescence levels , even 525 though the background per se does not . The outcome of this is a significant decrease in the accuracy of 526 gained (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) . For this reason , we assert that (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) should be mathematically deduced from a pre - 527 determined region of background , rather than directly predicted via human - trained models or calculated 528 from the frequency distribution of gradients even using the pre - determined background . 529 530 ILEE and visual inspection have different inclinations on the topology between two bright 531 filaments 532 17 Our data demonstrate that ILEE generally shows dominant robustness and accuracy for most indices , 533 compared to the manually portrayed ground truth binary image . However , there are three indices ( linear 534 density , static severing activity , and static branching activity ) where ILEE renders stable yet dramatically 535 lower output than those derived from the ground truth images ( Fig . 4d ) . Since the result is very stable , 536 we anticipate there may be certain systemic inclinations in either the human - portrayed ground truth or 537 the ILEE algorithm . After inspecting the binary images generated by ILEE compared with the ground truth , 538 we identified a potentially critical reason : ILEE is less likely to presume the ambiguous , dubious thin 539 connections inside the narrow space between two bright filaments . As demonstrated by Supplemental 540 Fig . 17 , while the ground truth and ILEE binary image look very similar , their skeleton images – which 541 represent their topological structure – show a discrepancy between two bundles of bright filaments . 542 Considering their procedure of generation , we speculate this is because : ( 1 ) , ILEE fully outer - joins the 543 binary results by a lower (cid:1837) (cid:2869) and a higher (cid:1837) (cid:2870) ( Fig . 3c ) , among which (cid:1837) (cid:2870) sacrifices the sensitivity to local 544 filaments at the high signal region to improve the sensitivity at the low signal region , including the edge 545 of thick filaments ; and ( 2 ) , human eyes tend to “hallucinate” imaginary filaments that do not statistically 546 exist . According to our knowledge , there is no overwhelming evidence suggesting either 2D ILEE or the 547 human eye is more accurate , but 2D ILEE is indeed more stable and conservative . However , 3D ILEE 548 may solve this paradox because many “adjacent” bright bundles are artifacts out of z - axis projection , 549 which is distant enough in 3D space to offer ILEE with a satisfactory resolution to split . 550 551 The 2D and 3D modes of ILEE may lead to different conclusions 552 For the analysis over bacteria treated leaf sample ( Fig . 6 ) , 2D ILEE generally agreed with MGT while 553 offering higher robustness and stability . Interestingly , this is not always the case for 3D ILEE , since it led 554 to different statistical conclusions from 2D approaches in linear density , skewness , diameter ( SDT ) , static 555 severing activity , and static branching activity . However , such difference is understandable , because the 556 3D mode indeed computes indices with higher accuracy and overcomes many limitations by the 2D data 557 structure . As demonstrated by Fig . 5b , c , 3D ILEE provide more or less improved absolute fidelity and 558 comparative sensitivity for skewness , diameter ( SDT ) , static severing activity , and static branching 559 activity ; therefore , our current data support that 3D ILEE is more trustworthy for these indices . Similarly , 560 the discrepancy of linear density over 2D approaches versus 3D ILEE in Fig . 6d also agrees with our 561 observation that 2D ILEE has higher comparative sensitivity for indices reflecting density . Hence , in terms 562 of any potential discrepancy between the 2D and 3D modes , we offer a general recommendation : for 563 occupancy only , 2D ILEE has better capability to distinguish biological difference ; for all other 564 cytoskeleton features , 3D ILEE is more trustworthy and dependable . Although it is currently difficult to 565 make a definite conclusion whether the current 2D or 3D mode is more accurate across all scenarios , it 566 18 is predictable that 3D computation will gradually substitute the classic 2D data structure , with the 567 mainstream personal computers gaining increasing computational power in the future . 568 569 Future development and applications 570 While ILEE has already remedied many disadvantages of traditional methods such as MGT , we are still 571 working to advance further the ILEE approaches presented herein . Our goal is to ultimately establish 572 algorithms and the toolbox that provide cytoskeletal indices at perfect accuracy and effectively answer 573 the specific demands in this field of study . As such , we offer the following as a list of potential upgrades 574 and applications to be integrated into the library : 575  Deep learning - based cytoskeleton segmentation algorithm with “foreign object” removal function . 576 As presented herein , ILEE enables the generation of trustworthy binary images on large scale , 577 which enables the construction of deep learning models to identify cytoskeleton components from 578 confocal images with potentially better performance . The deep learning - based approach is also 579 the key to solving the ultimate problem of all current cytoskeleton segmentation algorithms 580 ( including ILEE ) , which is the inability to detect and erase non - cytoskeleton objects with high 581 fluorescence , such as the nucleus and cytoplasm . As one approach to circumvent this limitation , 582 free fluorescence proteins can be used as a cell - permeable false signal . This will enable us to 583 train the model to recognize and exclude the non - cytoskeleton - like foreign objects , to render 584 ideally pure cytoskeletal datasets . 585  Vectorized intermediate image . After generating the difference image ( i . e . , (cid:1835) (cid:3031)(cid:3036)(cid:3033) , Fig . 3a ) using 586 ILEE , one computational limitation of our Python - based algorithm is the tradeoff between the 587 demand for unlimited high - resolution imaging versus limited computational power . Accordingly , 588 an ideal strategy is to transfer the pixel / voxel image to a 2D vector image or 3D polygon mesh for 589 index calculation . This will further enhance the accuracy of ILEE at an acceptable requirement of 590 computational power . 591  Regions of interest and organelle segmentation . There is currently a high demand in research of 592 plant cell biology to quantify cytoskeletal parameters in stomatal guard cells , as well as additional 593 cellular and subcellular architectures . In future releases of ILEE , we will develop approaches to 594 enable automated recognition and selection of regions of interest , such as stomata , for various 595 demands by the community . 596  Compatibility to x - y - t and x - y - z - t data , where t represents time . We are in the process of 597 developing a 4D - compatible analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics that tracks filament organization 598 over time . This approach will provide a temporal evaluation of supported indices with high 599 accuracy and robustness . 600 19 601 602 Methods 603 Plant genotypes and growth . Arabidopsis thaliana Col - 0 expressing the actin cytoskeletal marker GFP - 604 fABD2 36 was used in this study . Arabidopsis seeds were stratified for 2 d in the dark at 4°C then sown 605 onto the soil . All plants were grown in a BioChambers model FLX - 37 walk - in growth chamber 606 ( BioChambers , Manitoba , Canada ) at 20°C under long - day conditions ( 16 h of light / 8 h of dark ) with 60 % 607 relative humidity and a light intensity of approximately 120  mol photons m - 2 s - 1 . 608 609 Bacteria growth and plant inoculation . Pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato DC3000 ( Pst DC3000 ) 610 strains were grown as previously described 36 . Antibiotics used in this study include kanamycin ( GoldBio 611 # K - 120 - 5 , 50  g mL - 1 ) , and rifampicin ( GoldBio # R - 120 - 1 , 100  g mL - 1 ) . Bacterial treatments for actin 612 dynamics analysis were conducted following previously described methods 36 . Briefly , 2 - week - old 613 Arabidopsis Col - 0 / GFP - fABD2 was dipped for 30s in Dip - inoculation solution ( 10 mM MgCl2 + 0 . 02 % 614 Silwet - 77 ) with DC3000 with empty vector ( EV ) at a concentration OD 600 = 0 . 2 ( ca . 2 x 10 7 colony forming 615 units / mL ) . Confocal images were collected at 24 hours post - inoculation . 616 617 Mouse cancer cells sample . Yale University Mouse Melanoma line YUMMER1 . 7D4 cells ( EMD 618 Millipore , # SCC243 ) were cultured in DMEM ( ATCC # 30 - 2006 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco 619 # 10437 - 028 ) , 1 % Pen - strep ( ThermoFisher , # 15140122 ) , and 1 % NEAA ( Gibco , # 11140035 ) . For 620 staining actin stress fiber , approximately 10 , 000 cells were seeded onto a glass coverslip maintained in 621 a six - well plate overnight . First , semiconfluent cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 15 min at RT , 622 washed three times with PBS , then blocked in PBS supplemented with 2 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton for one 623 hour at RT . Next , cells were incubated with 100 nM rhodamine - phalloidin ( Cytoskeleton Inc , # PHDR1 ) in 624 blocking buffer for 30 minutes at RT in the dark , then washed with PBS three times each for 5 min with 625 gentle shaking at RT . Stained cells on the coverslip were mounted in ProLong Glass Antifade Mountant 626 with DAPI ( ThermoFisher , # P36982 ) . Slides were cured overnight at room temperature and were then 627 imaged . 628 629 Confocal microscopy . For plant leaf actin images , 2 - week - old Col - 0 / GFP - fABD2 plants were used for 630 data collection and analysis . Images of epidermal pavement cells and guard cells were collected using 631 laser confocal scanning microscope ( Olympus FV1000D ) by obtaining z - series sections at 0 . 5 µm 632 intervals . Optical setting : 65x / 1 . 42 PlanApo N objective with a 488 nm excitation laser and 510 - 575 nm 633 emission filter . Images were collected at a resolution of 800 x 800 x 25 ( x - y - z ) and a 12 - bit dynamic range . 634 20 Voxel size was 0 . 132 μm at the x - and y - axis and 0 . 5 μm at the z - axis . For animal cell actin images , 635 YUMMER1 . 7D4 stained by rhodamine - phalloidin were sampled by the same confocal system . Optical 636 setting : 100x / 1 . 40 UPLSAPO objective with a 559 nm excitation laser and 570 - 670 nm emission filter . 637 Images were collected at a resolution of 800 x 800 x 10 ( x - y - z ) with voxel size of 0 . 039 μm at the x - and 638 y - axis and 0 . 16 μm at the z - axis 639 640 Manually portrayed ground truth binary image . Seven raw projected images of 400x400 pixel size 641 with diverse visual appearance ( e . g . , actin density , shape , thickness , fluorescence brightness ) were 642 selected from our actin image database . Using a pen - drawing display ( HUION KAMVAS 22 Plus , GS2202 ) 643 and GIMP , we enhanced the brightness of low - value pixels to clarify the actin structure and carefully 644 portrayed the actin component of the selected image sample . The portrayed layer was extracted and 645 transferred to binary format for further evaluation . 646 647 Double - blind MGT analysis . For the mock versus P . syringae - inoculated sample pool , we erased the 648 sample name and randomized the order and distributed them to three independent scientists with rich 649 experience in cytoskeleton analysis ( referred to as OA , OB , and OC ) to let them determine the global 650 threshold value of each sample manually using the approach described previously 35 . Once completed , 651 we restored the grouping of the samples for batch analysis . We use Python to mimic the MGT pipeline 652 generally conducted by ImageJ after determining a specific thresholding value . OA also provided a 653 universal threshold value ( referred to as OA _ fix ) that applies to all samples as a commonly used fast 654 MGT approach . 655 656 Statistical analysis and data visualization . All data analysis was conducted in the Python 3 . 8 657 environment and was described in figure legends . 658 659 Determination of K 2 for sample batches . For both 2D and 3D modes of ILEE , each 12 - bit single - 660 channel 3D image (cid:1835) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) , (cid:1878) ) in a batch of samples was transferred into 2D image (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3037) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) ) by z - axis 661 maximum projection , where each pixel (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3037) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) ) = max { (cid:1835) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) , (cid:1878) ) | (cid:1878) ∈ (cid:1840) (cid:2878) , (cid:1878) < (cid:1878) (cid:3040)(cid:3028)(cid:3051) } . (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3037) was 662 processed by a Niblack thresholding function 16 ( library API reference [ 1 ] ) to render (cid:1835) (cid:3041)(cid:3036)(cid:3029)(cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) ) , with 663 parameter k = - 0 . 36 and (cid:1875)(cid:1861)(cid:1866)(cid:1856)(cid:1867)(cid:1875) _ (cid:1871)(cid:1861)(cid:1878)(cid:1857) = 2 int ( 25 (cid:1864) ) + 1 , where (cid:1864) is the mean of x and y resolution of (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3037) . 664 A binary image defined as (cid:1835) (cid:3029)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3028)(cid:3045)(cid:3052) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) ) = { 1 , (cid:1861)(cid:1858) (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3037) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) ) > (cid:1835) (cid:3041)(cid:3036)(cid:3029)(cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) ) ; 0 , (cid:1857)(cid:1864)(cid:1871)(cid:1857) } was generated . The 665 binary image was processed through Euclidean distance transformation ( library API reference [ 2 ] ) , and 666 the mean of the highest 5 % values was used as the input of the K 2 calculation function ( see Fig . 3 ) that 667 21 outputs individual recommended K 2 . Finally , the mean of all individual K 2 will be output as the recommend 668 K 2 for the total batch . 669 670 ILEE . An abbreviated workflow of ILEE is illustrated in Fig . 3b . Here , we describe the overall process in 671 further detail . For 2D mode , input image structure is (cid:1835) ( (cid:1868)(cid:1861)(cid:1876) ) = (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3037) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) ) = max { (cid:1835) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) , (cid:1878) ) | (cid:1878) ∈ (cid:1840) (cid:2878) , (cid:1878) < 672 (cid:1878) (cid:3040)(cid:3028)(cid:3051) } . For 3D mode , (cid:1835) ( (cid:1868)(cid:1861)(cid:1876) ) = (cid:1835) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) , (cid:1878) ) . First , (cid:1835) is treated by a significant difference filter ( SDF ; 673 Supplemental Fig . 4 ) to render (cid:1835) (cid:3020)(cid:3005)(cid:3007) , where : 674 675 676 In other words , it substitutes a pixel by the mean of the 8 adjacent pixels if the absolute difference 677 between it and that mean is higher than 2 - fold of the standard deviation of the surrounding pixels . Then , 678 (cid:1835) (cid:3020)(cid:3005)(cid:3007) is input to a discrete gaussian filter with a 3x3 ( x3 ) weighting kernel at (cid:2026) = 0 . 5 , to render (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3032) = 679 (cid:1833)(cid:1853)(cid:1873)(cid:1871)(cid:1871) ( (cid:1835) (cid:3020)(cid:3005)(cid:3007) ) , which is the smoothed pre - processed image . Since confocal microscopy has different 680 resolutions on x / y and z axis ( hereby named as (cid:1847) (cid:3051)(cid:3052) and (cid:1847) (cid:3053) ) , we adjusted the weighting kernel from 681 (cid:1841) (cid:3008)(cid:3028)(cid:3048)(cid:3046)(cid:3046) to (cid:1841) (cid:3008)(cid:3028)(cid:3048)(cid:3046)(cid:3046)(cid:4593) in 3D mode particularly by a scaling operator , as below : 682 683 22 From (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3032) , the gradient magnitude image G is rendered through Scharr operator as : 684 for 2D mode , or : 685 686 23 for 3D mode . Next , to calculate the gradient threshold ( (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) ) as an input for ILEE , a global threshold 687 (cid:1872) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) to determine the coarse background ( (cid:1835) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) , as flattened image ) is calculated by the NNES ( non - 688 connected negative element scanning ) function that satisfies : 689 690 691 If I is processed using the 2D mode , as demonstrated previously ( see Supplemental Figure 5 ) , the 692 statistical mean and STD of gradient magnitude of (cid:1835) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) ( (cid:2020) (cid:3008) . (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) and (cid:2026) (cid:3008) . (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) , respectively ) are univariate 693 proportional functions of the STD of (cid:1835) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) , (cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) , not influenced by the mean of (cid:1835) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) . Particularly , (cid:2020) (cid:3008) and (cid:2026) (cid:3008) , 694 of the coarse background area of the gradient image is : 695 696 (cid:2020) (cid:3008) . (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) = 0 . 8542 (cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) 697 (cid:2026) (cid:3008) .

Using the 700 optimized parameters described in Supplemental Figure 7 , (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) is deduced as : 701 702 k ( (cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) ) = 0 . 040018 (cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) 703 (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) = (cid:2020) (cid:3008) .

(cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) 704 705 If I is processed by the 3D mode , the inconformity of (cid:1847) (cid:3051)(cid:3052) and (cid:1847) (cid:3053) will not only impact the weighting of 706 Scharr operator , but also influencing the proportional coefficient of (cid:2026) (cid:3030)(cid:3029)(cid:3034) to (cid:2020) (cid:3008) and (cid:2026) (cid:3008) . We simulated the 707 accurate mathematical relationship between the proportional coefficient (cid:1863) (cid:3046) and (cid:1847) (cid:3053) / (cid:1847) (cid:3051)(cid:3052) ( see 708 Supplemental Figure 6 ) , so (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) for 3D can be calculated as : 709 710 (cid:2020) (cid:3008) .

Leveraging the spectral characteristics of discrete Laplacian 721 operators , we could filter out high - frequency components ( aka , high fluorescence fractions of 722 cytoskeleton ) while preserving the low - frequency salient geometric features of background fluorescence . 723 First , an edge image is defined as (cid:1835) (cid:3032)(cid:3031)(cid:3034)(cid:3032) ( (cid:1868)(cid:1861)(cid:1876) ) = (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3032) ( (cid:1868)(cid:1861)(cid:1876) ) , (cid:1861)(cid:1858)(cid:1833) ( (cid:1868)(cid:1861)(cid:1876) ) > (cid:1859)(cid:1872)ℎ(cid:1870)(cid:1857)(cid:1871) ; 0 , (cid:1857)(cid:1864)(cid:1871)(cid:1857) , but we transform 724 (cid:1835) (cid:3032)(cid:3031)(cid:3034)(cid:3032) into a flattened image vector (cid:1835) (cid:3032)(cid:3031)(cid:3034)(cid:3032) (cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)⃗ , and hence it can be further be represented as : 725 726 (cid:1835) (cid:3032)(cid:3031)(cid:3034)(cid:3032) (cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)⃗ = S (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3032) (cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)⃗ 727 728 where S is a ( sparse ) selection matrix , which is a diagonal matrix with i - th diagonal entry being 1 if the i - 729 th pixel has a gradient above (cid:1859) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) . 730 731 Next , according to the concept of Laplacian operator , we constructed the ( sparse ) Laplacian matrix L that 732 satisfies : 733 734 735 25 where the Laplacian operators in different modes are defined as : 736 737 Therefore , we can establish an implicit Laplacian linear system that targets the edge : 738 739 ( (cid:1838) + (cid:1837)(cid:1845) ) (cid:1835) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) (cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)⃗ = (cid:1835) (cid:3032)(cid:3031)(cid:3034)(cid:3032) (cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)⃗ = S (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3032) (cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)⃗ 740 741 where (cid:1835) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) (cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)(cid:4652)⃗ is the unknown to be solved by conjugate gradient method and restored to 2D / 3D array (cid:1835) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) , 742 and K is a weight that adjusts the influence Laplacian operator has on the result ( see Fig . 3B ) . 743 744 Finally , a difference image (cid:1835) (cid:3031)(cid:3036)(cid:3033) is calculated as (cid:1835) (cid:3031)(cid:3036)(cid:3033) = (cid:1835) (cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3032) − (cid:1835) (cid:3047)(cid:3035)(cid:3045)(cid:3032)(cid:3046) .

For images captured in 2D mode , it is (cid:1829)(cid:1867)(cid:1873)(cid:1866)(cid:1872) . (cid:1867)(cid:1858) . (cid:1840)(cid:1840)(cid:1831)(cid:3435)(cid:1835) (cid:3029)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3028)(cid:3045)(cid:3052) .

In 3D mode , both the count of non - connected elements and the length of 808 skeletonized filament are called from the Skan library using (cid:1835) (cid:3046)(cid:3038) computed from (cid:1835) (cid:3029)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3028)(cid:3045)(cid:3052) as the input . 809  Static branching activity : the branching point count per unit length of skeletonized filament . (cid:1835) (cid:3046)(cid:3038) 810 is obtained from (cid:1835) (cid:3029)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3028)(cid:3045)(cid:3052) . (cid:3042)(cid:3049)(cid:3046)(cid:3043) for 2D mode or (cid:1835) (cid:3029)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3028)(cid:3045)(cid:3052) for 3D mode respectively and is next input into 811 Skan library . The total number of type - 3 and type - 4 branches 22 is collected and then divided by 812 the length of the skeletonized filament . 813  Local anisotropy : We performed a local averaging of filament alignment tensor , which is 814 constructed as follows . First , we calculate the unit direction vector for each straight filament 815 segment (cid:1859) (cid:3036) . Then , the covariance matrix for each segment is obtained from the following equation : 816 817 (cid:1872) (cid:3036) = (cid:1859) (cid:3036) (cid:1859) (cid:3036) (cid:3047) 818 819 This rank - 2 tensor is independent of the orientation of the line segment , and can thus be averaged 820 over a region containing a collection of unoriented line segments . We weighed each filament 821 tensor in a circular / spherical neighborhood by the length of every filament to produce a smoothed 822 tensor field . The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue indicated the primary 823 orientation of filaments in this region . The difference between the maximum and the minimum 824 eigenvalues is an indicator of the anisotropy in this region . If all the eigenvalues are the same , 825 the indicator is 0 , which implies an isotropic region . If the eigenvalues other than the maximum 826 are all nearly 0 , all the filaments in this region are parallel to each other . In this case , they are all 827 aligned with the maximum eigenvector , the dominant filament direction of this region . 828 829 Simulation model of 3D artificial actin image . For each of the 31 training samples (cid:1835) ( (cid:1876) , (cid:1877) , (cid:1878) ) , the binary 830 image (cid:1835) (cid:3029)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3028)(cid:3045)(cid:3052) and skeleton image (cid:1835) (cid:3046)(cid:3038) were previously obtained via ILEE , as described above . Three 831 independent fractions reflecting artificial actin ( (cid:1835) (cid:3028)(cid:3047)(cid:3033) . (cid:3028) ) , artificial ground noise ( (cid:1835) (cid:3028)(cid:3047)(cid:3033) . (cid:3034)(cid:3041) ) , and artificial 832 diffraction noise ( (cid:1835) (cid:3028)(cid:3047)(cid:3033) . (cid:3031) ) are simulated independently . 833 834 To calculate (cid:1835) (cid:3028)(cid:3047)(cid:3033) . (cid:3028) , the brightness of the real actin ( (cid:1835) (cid:3028) ) of all training sample is collected as : 835 836 (cid:1835) (cid:3028) = (cid:1835) ∘ (cid:1835) (cid:3029)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3028)(cid:3045)(cid:3052) . 837 838 29 Here , we define the “reference voxel” of a non - zero voxel in (cid:1835) (cid:3028) as its nearest voxel whose position has a 839 positive value in (cid:1835) (cid:3046)(cid:3038) .

Supplemental Figures . pptx 1015 1016 35 Figures 1017 Fig . 1 : ILEE pipeline and the demonstration of cytoskeletal indices . a , ILEE is an adaptive local thresholding approach that 1018 applies to both 2D and 3D data structures , with an output of 12 cytoskeletal indices . Please note that total connected element , 1019 total branch , and total node ( marked “ * ” ) are not normalized indices for direct biological interpretation . b , Schematic diagram of 1020 the ILEE algorithm . ILEE requires a sample image with enhanced edge gradients , a computed gradient threshold , and an implicit 1021 Laplacian smoothing coefficient , K 2 , to generate a binary image and skeletonized image for index computation . Z - axis maximum 1022 projection ( red box ) is only conducted in the 2D mode . c , Visualized demonstration of ILEE performance . The raw data , binary 1023 image generated by ILEE , and demonstration of computed features by both 2D and 3D modes are shown . TDT , total distance 1024 transformation map , used to compute all diameter indices ; skeleton NCE , non - connected elements of skeleton image with each 1025 element by different colors , used to estimate severing activity ; branching , skeleton image with each branch in different color and 1026 each node by a black cross ; anisotropy , local anisotropy level , shown as length of red lines , and direction of the first eigenvector , 1027 shown as the direction of red lines . Scale bar = 20μm . 1028 1029 36 1030 Fig . 2 : NNES global thresholding . a , The conceptual decomposition of a confocal fluorescence image of the cytoskeleton . An 1031 Arabidopsis leaf confocal microscopic image of actin , as an example of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton , comprises of 3 components : 1032 ground noise , the mechanical noise of the sensor regardless of the true fluorescence signal , diffraction light , the unavoidable 1033 diffraction signal of fluorescence component around , and true actin signal . They correspond to the noise filtered by coarse 1034 background , noise additionally filtered by ILEE , and segmented actin components in the algorithm . b , The scheme and 1035 demonstration of NNES . The curve reflects the NNE ( negative non - connected component ) count when certain global 1036 thresholding is applied to the raw images of 30 randomly selected samples . Their extremely smooth shape makes it easy to 1037 detect the peak as a feature value as the input for the coarse background estimation model . The demonstration of the filtered 1038 background at positions ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) , and ( iv ) are shown above , where ( iii ) is adopted . The black area surrounded by colored area 1039 is the foreground information to be further processed . 1040 1041 37 1042 1043 Fig . 3 : Cytoskeletal identification by ILEE . a , Visual demonstration and summarized mathematical process of ILEE . On the 1044 left , the visualized intermediate images of ILEE process are presented ; on the right , an abbreviated mathematical process of 1045 ILEE is shown ( grey , image pre - processing ; blue , ILEE in a narrow sense ; yellow , post - processing ; also see Method for the 1046 detailed computational algorithm ) . b , The value of implicit Laplacian smoothing coefficient K influences ILEE performance . When 1047 K is small ( e . g . , 2 . 5 ) , the rendering of faint and thin filaments is accurate , but the edge of thick filaments tends to be omitted . 1048 Conversely , when K is large ( e . g . , 200 ) , rendering of thick filaments is accurate but thin and faint filaments are omitted . A solution 1049 is applied by creating a full outer join threshold image by a fixed K 1 = 2 . 5 and an estimated universal K 2 for an entire biological 1050 batch of samples . c , K 2 estimation model . A regression model to compute any universal K 2 for a given sample batch ( see 1051 Supplemental Figure 8 for detail ) . To augment the training samples , 7 images with manually portrayed binary ground truth are 1052 interpolated by a new resolution of different folds to the original into 42 samples ( shown as single dots ) that cover the general 1053 range of actin thickness . A non - linear regression estimation model is trained using the highest 5 % DT ( distance transform ) values 1054 in the ground truth ( representing filament thickness ) and an anticipated K 2 with a specific satisfactory capability to detect thick 1055 filament ( see Supplemental Figure 8 for detail ) . In the standard ILEE pipeline , the mean of top 5 % DT of all input samples will 1056 be calculated by Niblack thresholding to obtain the universal K 2 for ILEE . 1057 1058 38 1059 Fig . 4 : ILEE shows superior accuracy and stability over classic thresholding approaches . The manually portrayed binary 1060 ground truth of 7 visually diverse samples were compared with binary images rendered by ILEE , MGT , four global thresholding 1061 algorithms ( Otsu , Triangle , Li , Yan ) , and two local thresholding algorithms ( Niblack and Sauvola ) . a , Visualized comparison of 1062 39 ILEE versus other approaches . Pixels with different colors are defined as green : match of rendered binary image and ground 1063 truth ; blue : pseudo - negative , the pixels omitted by the algorithm ; red , noise - like pseudo - positive , the pixels that are rendered by 1064 the algorithm but not in the ground truth without a shape of filament ; brown , actin - like pseudo - positive , the pseudo - positive pixels 1065 within a filament - like component , which cannot be judged by high confidence . ILEE has the most accurate cytoskeleton 1066 segmentation . b , Quantitative comparison of pixel rendering demonstrated that ILEE has superior accuracy and stability across 1067 diverse samples . ILEE has the highest match rate with low and stable error rate ; MGT and Li also have acceptable performance . 1068 c , Comparison of distribution of distance transformation error . Single pixel errors of all 7 samples were merged and summarized 1069 as a violin plot . Red dashed line indicates no error , or results identical to the ground truth . ILEE has a symmetric and centralized 1070 distribution , indicating an accurate and unbiased filament segmentation . d , ILEE has accurate and stable computation of 1071 cytoskeletal indices . Nine biologically - interpretable cytoskeleton indices computed using binary images rendered by different 1072 algorithms were compared with the ground truth . The index values were normalized to the fold of ground truth . Red dashed line 1073 indicates 1 - fold , or identical to the ground truth . Additional results are shown in Supplemental Figure 10 - 13 . 1074 40 1075 41 1076 1077 Fig . 5 : The 3D mode of ILEE renders cytoskeleton indices at much higher accuracy than the 2D mode , due to advanced 1078 data structure . We utilized image samples ( N = 31 , 25 * 800 * 800 , Fig . 2 ) to train an actin image simulation model that generates 1079 31 artificial 3D actin images with ground truth . By comparing the performance of 3D and 2D ILEE over the artificial images , it 1080 was demonstrated that the 3D mode displays high fidelity to the ground truth while the 2D mode suffered from loss of information 1081 and systemic bias . a , The general experimental scheme . The raw 3D images are analyzed to train an actin image simulation 1082 model which uses statistical approaches to mimic the genuine actin filament , diffraction noise , and ground noise . Then 31 1083 artificial actin images are regenerated with specific ground truth in terms of both actin segmentation and cytoskeleton indices . 1084 The 3D and 2D ILEE were applied to the artificial images , whose results were then compared to their corresponding ground 1085 truth . b , a table comparing the absolute accuracy of ILEE by the 3D and 2D mode . It was demonstrated that 2D mode losses 1086 ~ 90 % of pixels ( voxels ) and ~ 50 % of the total length of actin samples , and is less accurate for most of the indices . Exclamation 1087 mark ( ! ) : contrast difference due to different definitions of dimensional space in their units ; not rigorously comparable . c , the 1088 linear correlation levels between ILEE results and the ground truth for all indices , by 2D and 3D mode . The absolute values of 1089 each index of the ground truth , 3D ILEE , and 2D ILEE are normalized by making their relative folds to the minimum data point 1090 of each group . A higher correlation coefficient r indicates a better capability to differentiate indices at different levels relatively , 1091 regardless of their absolute fidelity . The 3D mode has a generally better capability of differentiating high and low values . 1092 1093 42 1094 Fig . 6 : ILEE library enables the discovery of actin dynamic features of bacteria infected leaf tissue . Leaves of the 1095 Arabidopsis actin marker line Col - 0 / GFP - fABD2 were inoculated with mock or a virulent bacterial pathogen , Pseudomonas 1096 syringae pv . tomato DC3000 with empty vector ( EV , identical to wild type ) ; images ( n = 28 for mock , n = 31 for EV ) of epidermal 1097 43 cells were captured by laser scanning confocal microscopy at 24 hours post - inoculation ( hpi ) . MGT and ILEE were applied to 1098 generate binary images and all indices were computed using ILEE _ CSK . Double - blinded samples were provided to 3 operators 1099 ( experienced researchers ) OA , OB , and OC for comparison . OA additionally provides data using a universal threshold ( OA - fix ) . 1100 a , Experimental schematic diagram . b , Corelative comparison of MGTs of individual samples determined by different operators . 1101 A very low correlation between each pair of operators indicates MGT has an increased risk of bias and is potentially inaccurate . 1102 c , d , e , f , g , h , l , m , n , Output indices occupancy , linear density , skewness , CV , diameter _ TDT , diameter _ SDT , static severing 1103 activity , static branching activity , and local anisotropy , respectively . Blue , mock ; orange , EV . Multiple comparisons are conducted 1104 using a t - test without family - wise error correction ( because image samples themselves are ground truth for all methods ) . Groups 1105 without overlapping letters have p _ value lower than 0 . 05 . For n , a visual illustration of the concept of local anisotropy is attached , 1106 where each red line segment points to the “averaged” direction of actin growth in the local area and the length shows the intensity 1107 of consistency of the direction . i , j , k , Comparisons of different indices in bundling class . Skewness and CV have medium - weak 1108 correlation ; diameter _ TDT and diameter _ SDT have strong correlation ; diameter _ SDT , as a representative of direct indicator , 1109 and CV , as a representative of indirect indicator , have literally no correlation . 1110 1111
