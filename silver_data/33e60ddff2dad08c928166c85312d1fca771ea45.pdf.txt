Upon binding their membrane - tethered ligands , the ephrins , they regulate a great number of physiological processes including axon guidance and synapse formation . A unique feature of the Eph - ephrin interaction is the induction of bidirectional signalling into both Eph ( forward ) and ephrin ( reverse ) expressing cells . In this manner Ephs and ephrins can trigger repulsive guidance responses in a bidirectional manner . An important step in Eph - ephrin signal transduction is the removal of Eph - ephrin complexes from the cell surface to turn the initial contact between two opposing cells into repulsion . This can be achieved by trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , during which the entire receptor - ligand complex including patches of cell membrane is taken up by either cell . The molecular mechanisms regulating this process , especially in the reverse direction , are poorly understood . Previous studies have often relied on stimulation with soluble proteins , which may differ greatly from a more physiologically relevant , cell - contact - mediated interaction of membrane - tethered Ephs and ephrins . Therefore this study sought to determine the key players in Eph - ephrin reverse endocytosis using a functional assay that depends on cell - cell contact . I conducted a systematic analysis of the Rho GTPase subfamilies ( Rac , Rho , Cdc42 ) to decipher their respective involvement in different modes of Eph - ephrin endocytosis ( forward / reverse , soluble / cell - cell ) . This study revealed that the Rac subfamily of GTPases ( Rac1 , Rac3 , RhoG ) is required for EphB trans - endocytosis from the EphB - expressing cell into the opposing ephrinB + cell , but not for endocytosis of a soluble EphB protein . In addition to the experiments in human cell lines , co - culture of primary murine neurons with EphB - expressing cells implicated the same Rac - dependent mechanism for Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis in a physiologically relevant setting . While I found no regulatory role for Rho GTPases of the Cdc42 subfamily ( Cdc42 , RhoQ and RhoU ) , knockdown of RhoA subfamily members ( RhoA , RhoB ) led to an increase in endocytosis of soluble EphB2 into ephrinB + cells , but no change in EphB trans - endocytosis . An image - based siRNA screen of the Rho family guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) revealed the Rac - specific GEF Tiam2 as a key upstream regulator of Rac in EphB trans - endocytosis upon EphB - ephrinB IX engagement of two opposing cells . Furthermore the closely related Tiam1 is also required for trans - endocytosis in some cellular contexts . Analogously to the specific requirement of Rac activity in EphB trans - endocytosis , Tiam family proteins are dispensable for endocytosis of soluble EphB2 into ephrinB + cells . In summary , the work presented here provides new insights into the molecular regulation of Eph - ephrin endocytosis , which is relevant in physiological contexts , and outlines significant differences between endocytosis mediated by cell contact and endocytosis after stimulation with soluble proteins . Introduction 1 1 Introduction An important step in evolution was the occurrence of multicellular life forms , since organisms consisting of more than one cell have the significant advantage of being able to divide the numerous tasks necessary for survival and procreation between different specialised cell types . However , with the transition to multicellularity come new challenges . In order to co - ordinate their behaviour and functions , multicellular organisms not only need to interact with cues from the external world , but the various cells also need to be able to communicate with each other to regulate their activities . This is especially true in order to achieve a meaningful organisation of cells within a multicellular organism . A process which requires the spatial distribution of specific cell types to be tightly regulated commencing from the development of the organism . While this task already requires an astonishing level of complexity , even in simple organisms such as algae , sponges or jellyfish , the complexity scales up even more when considering the development of the vertebrate nervous system . Here , billions of neurons need to form up to a thousand synaptic connections each onto their correct partner cells , which in some cases need to cover distances of several meters , for example , in the spinal cord of giraffes ( Kandel 2013 ) . To communicate successfully with surrounding cells and the external world , cells have developed an intricate system of sensory proteins , which enables them to sense , process and convert signals coming from outside sources . These external cues can come in a great variety of forms , ranging from soluble molecules over elements of the extracellular matrix to molecules bound on the membranes of other cells . With a few exceptions , such as intracellular hormone receptors , sensory proteins of the cells are receptors that are present on the surface of the cell membrane . Given the diversity of possible interactors , these receptors also appear in multiple forms , all with their specific ligands and a specific intracellular machinery connected to translate the signal into the cell ( Alberts 2015 ) . These signalling events triggered by the activation of the receptor through its ligand can be very direct , such as changing membrane permeability for certain ions , or involve a whole cascade of intracellular signalling molecules . Accordingly , the cellular response can be Introduction 2 short - term , for example changing its morphology through rearrangement of the cytoskeleton , or long - term , as in the case of changes in gene expression . There are three main families of cell surface receptors . The first are ligand - gated ion channels , which increase membrane permeability for certain ions after activation through their ligand . They are especially important in the nervous system , where , for example , glutamate - gated cation channels such as α - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid ( AMPA ) or N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) are important for the signal transduction at synapses . Upon binding of the ligand , the G - protein dissociates from the receptor and separates into its subunits , which in turn act on different signalling molecules in the cell . The third large group of receptors are the enzyme - linked receptors , which in most cases contain only a single transmembrane domain . Many of the enzyme - linked receptors are protein kinases , which exert their function through the phosphorylation of target proteins , thus altering their biochemical properties . Among the enzyme - linked receptors , the Receptor - Tyrosine - Kinases ( RTKs ) are the most intensively studied and well characterised subfamily , and have many varying functions including control of cell division and the cell cycle , cell - cell communication , cell motility and cell survival ( Alberts 2015 ) . A group of RTKs that has been identified to play a prominent role during various aspects of development are the erythropoietin - producing hepatocellular carcinoma receptors ( Eph ) with their corresponding eph - receptor - interacting protein ( ephrin ) ligands . They are the main focus of this study and thus are introduced in more detail in the next chapter . Introduction 3 1 . 1 Eph receptors and ephrin ligands Eph receptors and their corresponding ephrin ligands play crucial roles in a great variety of different physiological and pathological processes . While traditionally mainly implicated in many developmental processes such as cell migration , cell sorting and tissue - border formation ( reviewed in ( Batlle & Wilkinson 2012 , Klein 2012 ) ; it has become increasing clear that the Eph - ephrin system is also essential for many functions in the developed body in both health and disease ( Pasquale 2008 , Klein 2009 , Pasquale 2010 ) . Given their broad and essential roles , the focus of a large body of work has been to elucidate the structural properties of Ephs and ephrins , the molecular mechanisms regulating their signalling , and how they affect normal and pathological physiology , as described below . 1 . 1 . 1 Domain topology Ephs are the largest family of RTKs . They are divided in two subclasses , EphAs and EphBs , and each subclass consists of several distinct members , whose number varies between different classes of organisms . For example , in mammals there are 9 A - type and 6 B - type Eph receptors , as well as five ephrinA and three ephrinB ligands ( Eph Nomenclature Committee 1997 ) , whereas in Caenorhabditis elegans there is only one Eph receptor and four different types of ephrins ( George et al . 1998 , Wang et al . 1999 ) , and in Drosophila melanogaster only a single Eph - ephrin pair has been identified ( Scully et al . 1999 , Bossing & Brand 2002 ) . The subdivision of Eph receptors into A - and B - type depends on their binding preference for either A - type or B - type ephrins , respectively . EphrinAs are tethered to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) – anchor , while ephrinBs contain a single transmembrane ( TM ) domain and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail . Despite their distinct binding preferences , EphAs and EphBs share the same principle domain organisation ( Fig . 1 ) . The extracellular part of the receptor consists of a globular ligand binding domain ( LBD ) , a cysteine - rich region , which itself contains a sushi domain and an EGF - like domain , and two fibronectin type - III repeats ( FNIII ) . The TM segment of the receptor entails a single - pass  - helical domain . The juxtamembrane ( JM ) region of the Introduction 4 receptor is followed by a catalytically active kinase domain , a sterile -  motif ( SAM ) and a Psd - 95 , Dlg and ZO1 ( PDZ ) domain ( Pasquale 2008 ) . The extracellular domain topology of ephrinAs and ephrinBs is highly conserved and consists of a globular receptor binding domain ( RBD ) and a short linker of about 40 amino acids ( aa ) in length . EphrinAs are tethered to the plasma membrane by a GPI - anchor and lack any intracellular domains , whereas the ephrinBs are TM proteins , whose cytoplasmic tail contains a PDZ binding motif as well as five key tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated upon activation ( Kalo et al . 2001 , Song et al . 2002 , Pasquale 2008 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . 1 . 1 . 2 Signalling from Ephs and ephrins Ephs and ephrins are traditionally thought to reside in the membranes of opposing cells and trigger a signalling response upon coming into contact via their globular RBDs and LBDs , respectively ( Labrador et al . 1997 , Lackmann et al . 1997 , Lackmann et al . 1998 , Himanen et al . 2001 ) . Nonetheless , more recently , several cases have been described for a functional role of cis - interaction of Eph receptors and ephrins being expressed in the same cell , in which the ephrins can attenuate the signalling response of the Eph receptor ( Carvalho et al . 2006 , Kao & Kania 2011 ) . A unique feature of the Eph - ephrin system is its ability to initiate bidirectional signalling ( Holland et al . 1996 , Bruckner et al . 1997 , Kalo et al . 2001 , Yu & Bargmann 2001 , Davy et al . 2004 ) . Signals into the Eph - expressing cell are referred to as forward signalling , while signalling in the ephrin - expressing cell is called reverse signalling . Reverse signals can either be mediated through co - receptors , as in the case of ephrinAs ( Kramer et al . 2006 , Beg et al . 2007 , Lim et al . 2008b , Bonanomi et al . 2012 ) or through signalling molecules binding to the cytoplasmic tail of ephrinBs ( Bruckner et al . 1999 , Cowan & Henkemeyer 2001 , Palmer et al . 2002 ) . Interestingly , downstream targets of Eph - ephrin signalling differ significantly between the forward and reverse directions ( Jorgensen et al . 2009 ) . Typically Ephs and ephrins are expressed in a complementary pattern and mediate a repulsive signal , leading to morphological changes of the cells , thus enabling processes like cell separation or growth cone collapse in neurons ( Drescher et al . 1995 , Gale et al . 1996 , Mellitzer et al . 1999 , Mann et al . 2003 ) . Nonetheless a growing number of physiological situations has emerged , where Eph - ephrin signalling is primarily adhesive , especially in the context of Introduction 5 Figure 1 .

Scheme adapted from ( Himanen & Nikolov 2003 , Klein 2012 ) Introduction 6 synaptic plasticity , but also in some axon guidance decisions ( Davy & Robbins 2000 , Holmberg et al . 2000 , Poliakov et al . 2004 , Egea & Klein 2007 , Klein 2009 ) . 1 . 1 . 2 . 1 Eph forward signalling Many RTKs become catalytically active after ligand binding leads to a dimerization of the receptor . Ephs differ from this pattern , as they require higher - order cluster formation to initiate signalling ( Fig . 1 ) ( Stein et al . 1998 , Himanen et al . 2001 , Smith et al . 2004 , Himanen et al . 2010 ) . After the initial hetero - dimer between Eph and ephrin is formed , a second receptor - ligand pair is recruited , forming a hetero - tetramer before higher - order clusters involving larger numbers of receptors can develop ( Smith et al . 2004 , Seiradake et al . 2010 ) . In the case of EphB2 - ephrinB2 signalling , the hetero - tetramer of two receptor and ligand molecules each has been reported to be sufficient to induce bidirectional signalling ( Himanen et al . 2001 ) . Recent publications have highlighted the fact that Eph - ephrin clusters can elicit different signalling responses depending on their composition . One study showed that the number of higher - order complexes versus the number of dimers in EphB2 clusters determines the strength of the cellular signalling response in case of cell collapse ( Schaupp et al . 2014 ) . Additionally , differences in the structural properties of Ephs can be responsible for distinguishing between adhesive and repulsive responses upon stimulation with the same ligand , as is the case for EphA2 and EphA4 upon ephrinA5 stimulation ( Seiradake et al . 2013 ) . The clustering of Ephs can either be induced by membrane - tethered ephrins or by ephrin ectodomains that have been pre - clustered and are applied in solution ( Davis et al . 1994 ) , a fact that has been heavily utilised in subsequent functional studies of the Eph - ephrin system ( Tanaka et al . 2004 , Cowan et al . 2005 , Sahin et al . 2005 , Tolias et al . 2007 , Um et al . 2014 ) . However , in how far stimulation with pre - clustered ectodomains elicits the same signalling responses as cell contact - mediated stimulation is not clear , as the two approaches lead to distinct downstream phosphorylation patterns ( Jorgensen et al . 2009 ) . The clusters can propagate by including a growing number of molecules after their initial formation and there is also evidence that Ephs can be recruited into signalling clusters independent of ephrin binding ( Wimmer - Kleikamp et al . 2004 ) . This ephrin - independent recruitment of Ephs could potentially be explained by homotypic interactions between Ephs mediated by Introduction 7 their extracellular LBDs , sushi and / or FNII domains , as well as their cytoplasmic SAM domain ( Lackmann et al . 1998 , Himanen & Nikolov 2003 , Himanen et al . 2010 , Seiradake et al . 2010 ) . Within their respective subclasses , Ephs are able to bind promiscuously to several ephrins and vice versa , but the binding affinities can vary greatly between different ligand - receptor pairs ( Brambilla et al . 1995 , Brambilla et al . 1996 , Gale et al . 1996 ) . However , more and more evidence has also highlighted the role of cross - subclass binding , as in the examples of EphA4 , which can bind to ephrinB2 or ephrinB3 in addition to ephrinAs ( Smith et al . 1997 , Kullander et al . 2001a , Kullander et al . 2001b , Qin et al . 2010 ) , or EphB2 that can bind ephrinA5 ( Himanen et al . 2004 ) . This inter - class binding adds a further level of complexity to the Eph - ephrin system , thus enabling cells expressing a single type of receptor to receive and integrate important signalling cues from environments expressing different types of ligands . Activity of the Eph receptor kinase domain is required for repulsive signalling in the forward direction ( Holmberg et al . 2000 ) . After ligand - induced cluster formation , Ephs transition from a state that is only weakly catalytically active to high kinase activity in a multi - step process ( Binns et al . 2000 , Kullander et al . 2001b , Wybenga - Groot et al . 2001 ) . Firstly , ligand binding and cluster formation lead to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the JM region , which induces a conformational change that releases the auto - inhibition of the kinase domain by electrostatic repulsion ( Fig . 1 ) ( Wybenga - Groot et al . 2001 ) . Secondly , after initial phosphorylation of tyrosines in the JM region , Ephs can autophosphorylate several conserved tyrosines within the kinase domain , which further increases catalytic activity ( Kalo & Pasquale 1999 , Binns et al . 2000 ) . Additionally , after initial phosphorylation events in the JM region , Ephs can be further phosphorylated by members of the sarcoma virus transforming gene product ( src ) family of kinases ( SFK ) ( Ellis et al . 1996 , Zisch et al . 1998 ) . The phosphorylation - induced conformational changes also allow the docking of src - homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain containing proteins . These interactions with SH2 domain containing proteins seem to be dispensable for the principle activation of Ephs and may instead rather play a role in fine - tuning or triggering additional , separate signalling responses ( Zisch et al . 2000 ) . Furthermore , the SAM and PDZ domains also play a role in Eph signalling . PDZ - containing interactors can stabilise Eph clusters as Introduction 8 scaffolding proteins or initiate distinct signalling pathways themselves ( Hsueh & Sheng 1998 , Torres et al . 1998 ) . However , it is not yet completely understood whether , and to what extent , the interactions with SAM or PDZ domain - containing proteins are necessary for physiological Eph functions , as truncation of these domains does not abolish all signalling responses ( Kullander et al . 2001b , Park et al . 2004 ) . An interesting study by Egea and colleagues employing a mutated , constitutively catalytically active EphA4 further elucidated the importance of the kinase domain and highlighted the role of signalling modulation by interaction with the ephrin ligands . Their experiments show that while kinase activity independent of ligand binding is sufficient for axon guidance decisions like midline repulsion , correct formation of thalamo - cortical projections requires signalling modulation through ephrin ligands ( Egea et al . 2005 ) . While these results establish the importance of Eph receptor kinase function in forward signalling , the role of Ephs acting as ligands for ephrin reverse signalling is independent of their kinase activity ( Kullander et al . 2001b ) . 1 . 1 . 2 . 2 Reverse signalling through ephrins In contrast to the EphA and EphB receptors , which share many signalling properties , ephrinAs and ephrinBs differ significantly in their signalling mechanisms due to their very dissimilar structural architecture . EphrinA signalling Lacking a cytoplasmic domain and instead being linked to the plasma membrane by a GPI - anchor , the mechanisms by which ephrinAs translate their signal into the cell are particularly interesting . A growing body of evidence supports the theory that they mediate their function by recruiting co - receptors after being activated by Ephs . Among the receptors reported to function as co - receptors with ephrinAs are the Glia cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) receptor , proto - oncogene tyrosine - protein kinase receptor RET ( RET ) ( Kramer et al . 2006 , Dudanova et al . 2010 , Bonanomi et al . 2012 ) , and the neurotrophin receptors p75 ( Lim et al . 2008b ) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) ( Marler et al . 2008 ) . The cross - talk of the neurotrophin and Eph - ephrin signalling systems is highly functionally relevant , as can be seen by the varied responses ( axon branching Introduction 9 versus axon repulsion ) downstream of ephrinA6 depending on its association with either p75 or TrkB ( Poopalasundaram et al . 2011 ) . Another proposed mechanism for ephrinA reverse signalling is that ephrinA clusters concentrate in special membrane compartments such as rafts or caveloae and trap SFKs such as fyn or other signalling molecules such as integrins within to enact their signalling ( Davy et al . 1999 , Davy & Robbins 2000 ) . EphrinB signalling B - type ephrins contain a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail that encompasses five tyrosine residues , which can become phosphorylated upon binding to Eph receptors , as well as a PDZ domain ( Bergemann et al . 1998 , Torres et al . 1998 , Bruckner et al . 1999 , Song et al . 2002 ) . As for Eph receptors , it has been proposed that ephrinBs undergo a conformational change in their cytoplasmic tail upon activation , thus facilitating the access of downstream signalling effectors ( Song et al . 2002 , Song 2003 ) . Src family kinases are key mediators of ephrin phosphorylation ( Kalo et al . 2001 , Palmer et al . 2002 , Foo et al . 2006 , Georgakopoulos et al . 2006 ) . Once phosphorylated , the cytoplasmic tail of ephrinBs can bind to SH2 / SH3 adaptor proteins such as Grb4 that mediate downstream signalling events , for example , actin cytoskeleton rearrangements ( Cowan & Henkemeyer 2001 , Segura et al . 2007 , Xu & Henkemeyer 2009 ) . In contrast to the Eph receptors , the PDZ domain in ephrinBs has been shown to be of crucial importance for several physiological functions . By binding protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP - BL , the PDZ domain triggers the dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail and thus enables fine tuning of the ephrinB signalling response , possibly also switching from phosphorylation - dependent to PDZ adaptor protein - mediated signalling ( Palmer et al . 2002 ) . Another study shows that for the remodelling of the vasculature mediated by ephrinB2 the PDZ domain is required , as mice expressing mutant ephrinB2 lacking the PDZ domain die within weeks after birth presenting severe malformation of lymphatic vasculature . In contrast , mice expressing ephrinB2 lacking all five cytoplasmic tyrosine residues exhibit only a very mild phenotype with minor malformations and no premature lethality ( Makinen et al . 2005 ) . PDZ - containing scaffolding proteins also mediate cross - talk to other signalling pathways as in the case of PDZ - RGS3 , which attenuates signalling downstream of the heterotrimeric G - protein - Introduction 10 coupled receptor CXCR4 through its GTPase - activating properties ( Lu et al . 2001 ) . Interaction with the scaffolding proteins of the glutamate receptor interacting protein ( GRIP ) family helps recruit kinases to ephrin clusters ( Bruckner et al . 1999 ) and also promotes glutamatergic synapse formation by stabilising α - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid ( AMPA ) receptors in postsynaptic domains ( Aoto et al . 2007 , Essmann et al . 2008 ) . Together , these findings have emphasised the importance of reverse signalling in eliciting additional and distinct signalling responses , both through phosphorylation - dependent , and PDZ - dependent pathways . 1 . 1 . 2 . 3 Signal attenuation An interesting question in Eph - ephrin signalling is how a high - affinity adhesive reaction between receptor and ligand is translated into cellular repulsion . While there is a growing number of physiological functions that require adhesive Eph - ephrin signalling , for example , the requirement of EphA splice isoforms lacking kinase - mediated repulsive signalling properties for neural tube formation ( Holmberg et al . 2000 ) , or the involvement of Eph receptors and ephrins in synaptic stability and plasticity ( reviewed in Klein 2009 ) ; in the majority of cases the signal mediated by ephrins and Ephs is repulsive . In order to achieve repulsion between cells , it is not only necessary that the cytoskeletal architecture is re - arranged downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling , but also that the high - affinity ligand - receptor complex comprising molecules from opposing cell membranes is removed from the cell surface . Two major pathways for removal of Eph - ephrin complexes from the cell surface have been discovered . The first is trans - endocytosis of entire Eph - ephrin complexes into the cell ( Marston et al . 2003 , Zimmer et al . 2003 ) . This process is the main focus of this thesis and will be discussed in depth in section 1 . 3 . 3 . The second mechanism to remove Eph - ephrin complexes from the cell surface is by proteolytic cleavage . The metalloprotease A - Disintegrin - And - metalloprotease 10 ( ADAM10 ) has been reported to be able to cleave ephrinAs at their ectodomain in trans after being activated by EphAs and increase contact - mediated repulsion ( Hattori et al . 2000 , Janes et al . 2005 , Janes et al . 2009 ) . EphA2 can be cleaved by membrane type - 1 matrix metallo - proteinase ( MT1 - MMP ) , triggering cell Introduction 11 repulsion in cancer cells ( Sugiyama et al . 2013 ) . EphA4 can be cleaved , but the physiological relevance for repulsive signalling of EphA4 cleavage is not completely understood as mice expressing cleavage - resistant EphA4 receptors show only a mild phenotype in axon guidance and EphA4 cleavage was independent of ephrinA activation ( Gatto et al . 2014 ) . Gatto and colleagues further observed altered levels of EphA4 expression and thus suggested a role for EphA4 cleavage in the fine - tuning between cis and trans signalling from EphA4 receptors . Addtionally , another study proposed EphA4 cleavage by  - secretase to be dependent on synaptic activity ( Inoue et al . 2009 ) . EphrinBs can be cleaved in c is by metalloproteinases and  - secretases ( Georgakopoulos et al . 2006 , Tomita et al . 2006 ) . The work by Georgakopoulos and colleagues further suggests that the cleavage of ephrinB2 does not terminate signalling , but rather that the generated intracellular fragment possesses distinct signalling capabilities and mediates the activation of src kinase downstream of ephrinB2 after activation by EphBs . Similarly , reports of the cleavage of EphBs have suggested physiological signalling properties for the cleaved intracellular fragments and implicated that cleavage is dependent on calcium influx and ligand binding ( Litterst et al . 2007 ) , and that the cleaved fragments are involved in regulating cell surface expression of NMDA receptors ( Xu et al . 2009 ) . However , whether these findings represent a general signalling mechanism mediated by cleaved fragments in EphB - ephrinB signalling remains unclear , especially , since another report shows EphB cleavage after binding to ephrinBs to be required in the more classical role of cell repulsion ( Lin et al . 2008 ) . These studies show that cleavage of Eph receptors and / or ephrins fulfils several important physiological roles that might extend beyond enabling cell - cell detachment and signal attenuation . 1 . 1 . 3 Physiological functions of Eph ‐ ephrin signalling As alluded to already , the Eph - ephrin signalling system is involved in a plethora of physiological functions and plays important roles both in development and adult physiology , as well as in health and disease . By giving examples for the roles of Eph - ephrin signalling in the nervous system I would like to introduce some of the interesting features and common mechanisms of the Eph - ephrin system . Several excellent reviews exist that Introduction 12 examine the involvement of Eph - ephrin signalling in vascular development ( Adams & Eichmann 2010 , Klein 2012 , Pitulescu & Adams 2014 ) , cell differentiation and proliferation ( Genander & Frisen 2010 , Wilkinson 2014 ) , the immune system ( Wu & Luo 2005 , Funk & Orr 2013 ) , glucose homeostasis ( Jain & Lammert 2009 ) , bone maintenance ( Edwards & Mundy 2008 ) , as well as its role in neurodegenerative diseases ( Cisse & Checler 2015 ) and cancer ( Genander & Frisen 2010 , Pasquale 2010 ) , and I will thus refrain from discussing these functions in detail here . 1 . 1 . 3 . 1 Eph ‐ ephrin signalling in axon guidance Probably the most intensely studied and well - established role of Eph - ephrin signalling in the nervous system is its involvement in axon guidance during neuronal development . Already in the 1990s , a study by Bonhoeffer and colleagues established the ability of the Eph - ephrin system to initiate repulsive guidance responses by triggering axonal growth cone collapse ( Drescher et al . 1995 ) . Since then , a large number of subsequent studies have built upon this seminal work ( some selected references Wahl et al . 2000 , Mann et al . 2003 , Sahin et al . 2005 ) . Here , I will use two well - studied physiological settings , retinotopic map formation and guidance of motor neurons , to illustrate the physiological relevance of Eph - ephrin signalling in axon guidance . Processing of sensory information often depends on the correct topographic mapping of sensory inputs onto higher brain centres . One example is the input of visual information through the retina . The spatial information of retinal activation patterns is crucial for its correct interpretation in higher brain centres . Therefore , the well - defined topographic organisation is retained in neurons projecting from the retina to the tectum . Axon guidance by the Eph - ephrin system is important for the correct formation of these topographic maps in order to relay information from the retina to higher brain centres . EphA - ephrinA bidirectional signalling is required to form correct retino - tectal projections and , depending on the exact localisation of expression of receptors and ligands , they can be either repulsive or attractive cues ( Knoll et al . 2001 , Knoll & Drescher 2002 , Dufour et al . 2003 , Marquardt et al . 2005 ) . One mechanism important for topographic map formation is a differentiated EphA response resulting from gradients of EphA and ephrinA expression between the retinal origin and tectal target zones of neurons ( Brown et al . 2000 ) . Recent work has Introduction 13 shown that the gradient of ephrinA correlates with the target size of the topographic map established in the tectum ( Tadesse et al . 2013 ) . Topographic map formation also depends on the kinase function of EphA4 ( Dufour et al . 2006 ) . Marquardt and colleagues propose that contrasting repulsive and attractive signalling responses are regulated by EphAs and ephrinAs residing in the same neuron , but within distinct membrane domains ( Marquardt et al . 2005 ) . Another report suggests that eprhinAs reduce EphA - mediated repulsive signalling by acting on EphAs in cis ( Carvalho et al . 2006 ) . Reverse signalling from ephrinAs in topographic map formation seems to intersect with neurotrophic signalling and p75 has been implicated as the responsible co - receptor ( Lim et al . 2008b , Grimbert & Cang 2012 ) . In how far correct map formation also is dependent on neuronal activity in the retinal ganglion cells is still a matter of debate , with work supporting an important role of activity ( Grimbert & Cang 2012 ) and other results suggesting neuronal activity is dispensable ( Benjumeda et al . 2013 ) . Guidance of motor axons to their correct targeting zones in limbs also relies heavily on Eph - ephrin signalling . Motor neurons originating in the motor cortex need to cross the midline before forming the corticospinal tract and finally innervating targets on the contra - lateral side of their origin . This process requires EphA4 signalling in the axons , which are repelled by ephrinB3 expressed in cells on the midline of the spinal cord ( Dottori et al . 1998 , Coonan et al . 2001 , Kullander et al . 2001a , Kullander et al . 2001b ) . These EphA4 - expressing neurons form a component of the central pattern generator required for locomotion and the aberrant crossing of neurons in EphA4 - knockout mice leads to a distinct hopping phenotype due to abnormal synchronous activation of limbs on both sides ( Kullander et al . 2003 ) . Three independent studies suggest that one key downstream player of EphA4 signalling in this context is the Rac GTPase activating protein ( GAP )  - chimaerin , as an  - chimaerin knockout mouse phenocopies the EphA4 knockout ( Beg et al . 2007 , Iwasato et al . 2007 , Wegmeyer et al . 2007 ) . Correct formation of spinal motor circuits has been reported to consist of distinct clustering - dependent and independent EphA4 signalling mechanisms ( Egea et al . 2005 ) . Recent work from Paixao and colleagues has furthermore demonstrated that ephrinB3 - EphA4 signalling is required for the correct formation of both descending and ascending axon tracts in the spinal cord ( Paixao et al . 2013 ) . Once motor neurons leave the spinal cord , interactions between ephrinAs and Introduction 14 EphA4 are crucial for neurons to reach their target areas in the limb musculature ( Kramer et al . 2006 , Dudanova et al . 2010 , Kao & Kania 2011 , Bonanomi et al . 2012 , Dudanova et al . 2012 ) . Reverse signalling by ephrinAs is required in this context , and RET functions as a co - receptor alongside ephrinAs linking contact - mediated Eph - ephrin interaction to signalling by the diffusible neurotrophic guidance cue GDNF ( Kramer et al . 2006 , Dudanova et al . 2010 , Bonanomi et al . 2012 ) . The studies from Dudanova and colleagues , as well as from Kao and colleagues , have highlighted an intricate interplay between repulsive EphA signalling , attractive ephrinA signalling and signal attenuation by cis interactions between ephrinAs and EphA receptors . All of these mechanisms are acting on the same neuron and are required for the precise spatio - temporal control of axon guidance from the spinal cord to the limb muscles ( Kao & Kania 2011 , Dudanova et al . 2012 ) . Cleavage of EphAs is an additional mechanism to fine - tune this process ( Gatto et al . 2014 ) . The Eph - ephrin system is well established as a key regulator of axon guidance in several physiological contexts . The examples given in this short overview illustrate that the role of Eph - ephrin signalling is far more complex than providing mere repulsive guidance cues by inducing growth cone collapse . Cross - talk between subclasses , regulation by downstream effectors , cis signalling and adhesive responses all contribute to the central role of Eph - ephrin signalling in orchestrating fine - tuned axonal guidance decisions . Despite the growing body of work , many details of the underlying molecular mechanism for Eph - ephrin - mediated axon guidance , especially regarding the process of cell detachment , remain to be unravelled . 1 . 1 . 3 . 2 Eph ‐ ephrin signalling at synapses Eph - ephrin signalling plays a different role at synapses , where it can mediate adhesive signals and is involved in the generation of synapses , as well as synaptic maintenance and plasticity . Eph ‐ ephrin signalling in synaptogenesis Ephs can regulate the formation of excitatory synaptic connections by stabilising NMDA receptors at postsynaptic specialisations ( Dalva et al . 2000 ) . Another suggested mechanism for how Eph receptors contribute to synapse formation is by increasing motility of dendritic Introduction 15 filopodia ( Kayser et al . 2008 ) . Whether promotion of synaptogenesis by EphBs requires their kinase function is still a matter of debate . Recent work from Greenberg and colleagues using a chemical genetic approach suggests that the kinase function is not required for synaptogenesis ( Soskis et al . 2012 ) . However earlier work from the same group suggests that excitatory synapse formation is promoted by enhancing degradation of ephexin5 through its phosphorylation by EphB receptors ( Margolis et al . 2010 ) . Excitatory synapses often form on dendritic protrusions called spines and EphBs play important roles in forming these spines as a step leading up to synapse formation ( Henkemeyer et al . 2003 , Kayser et al . 2006 ) . While EphBs have been shown to play a role in postsynaptic development , ephrinBs have been implicated in presynaptic development ( Kayser et al . 2006 , Lim et al . 2008a , McClelland et al . 2009 ) . This regulation of synaptic development can depend on interaction with syntenin ( McClelland et al . 2009 ) . Syntenin itself can bind and stabilise glutamatergic receptors at synapses ( Hirbec et al . 2002 ) . Nonetheless , other studies , found ephrinBs to also be involved in synapse formation on the postsynaptic side ( Aoto et al . 2007 , Segura et al . 2007 , Xu et al . 2011 ) . The postsynaptic involvement of ephrinB3 can also be mediated through syntenin , an interaction independent of phosphorylation of ephrinB3 ( Xu et al . 2011 ) . Other proteins implicated downstream of ephrinBs in synapse formation are GrB4 , which in this case would argue for the requirement of ephrinB phosphorylation ( Segura et al . 2007 ) , and the PDZ domain interactor GRIP1 ( Aoto et al . 2007 ) . Eph ‐ ephrin signalling in neuronal plasticity Eph - ephrin signalling is not limited to functions in the developing nervous system . An increasing body of work underlines the importance of the Eph - ephrin system for plasticity in the mature nervous system on both the levels of synapses as well as dendrites and spines . One important feature of plasticity on the synaptic level is the activity - dependent change in signalling properties and synaptic strength known as long - term potentiation ( LTP ) ( Bliss & Lomo 1973 , Bliss & Collingridge 1993 ) . EphB receptors can phosphorylate NMDA receptors either directly ( Dalva et al . 2000 ) or through src family kinases ( Takasu et al . 2002 ) , and thereby modulate synaptic plasticity . Further studies have identified the postsynaptic requirement of EphB receptors for NMDA - mediated LTP generation Introduction 16 ( Grunwald et al . 2001 , Contractor et al . 2002 ) . EphB signalling in LTP is independent of its kinase function . Grunwald and colleagues showed that EphB receptors truncated at the carboxy - terminus were sufficient to rescue the EphB knockout phenotype ( Grunwald et al . 2001 ) . Potentially , the kinase - independent signalling is promoted by scaffolding proteins binding to the PDZ domain of EphB2 like GRIP1 , which clusters glutamatergic receptors ( Contractor et al . 2002 ) . Paralleling their requirement in synaptogenesis , ephrin molecules also play reciprocal roles in synaptic plasticity and can act on both the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides . Several studies showed the involvement of ephrinBs in LTP in the hippocampus ( Contractor et al . 2002 , Grunwald et al . 2004 , Armstrong et al . 2006 , Bouzioukh et al . 2007 , Lim et al . 2008a ) . The effect of ephrinBs on LTP can be dependent on ( Grunwald et al . 2004 ) or independent of the function of NMDA receptors ( Armstrong et al . 2006 , Lim et al . 2008a ) . LTP downstream of ephrinBs requires phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in contrast to long - term depression ( LTD ) , which is phosphorylation independent ( Bouzioukh et al . 2007 ) . Another pathway by which ephrinBs can influence synaptic plasticity is by stabilising AMPA receptors at synapses , which requires the phosphorylation of a serine residue of ephrinB2 ( Essmann et al . 2008 ) . Interestingly , Eph - ephrin signalling can also influence LTP in a more indirect route , since an EphA4 - ephrinA3 interaction between neuronal and glia cells regulates glutamate uptake into astrocytes and thereby the induction of LTP at adjacent synapses ( Filosa et al . 2009 ) . In addition to changes at the synaptic level , plasticity in the mature nervous system is also mediated by morphological changes at the level of spines and dendrites ( Yuste & Bonhoeffer 2001 ) . Eph - ephrin signalling can exert these effects on the cytoskeletal architecture of cells , for example via signalling through Rho - family GTPases ( see section 1 . 2 . 3 for more details ) , and is thus also able to effect morphological changes in neuronal plasticity . Experiments in cultured neurons have revealed that EphBs regulate the morphology of dendritic spines , for example through Cdc42 and its guanine exchange factor ( GEF ) intersectin ( ITSN ) ( Irie & Yamaguchi 2002 , Nishimura et al . 2006 ) , or Rac1 and its GEFs Kalirin ( Penzes et al . 2003 ) or Tiam1 ( Tolias et al . 2005 , Tolias et al . 2007 ) . Ephrin reverse signalling can also facilitate dendritic remodelling in a phosphorylation - and PDZ - dependent manner through Grb4 , PICK1 and syntenin downstream of eprinB3 Introduction 17 ( Xu et al . 2011 ) . Similar to its relevance for LTP , neuron - glia cross - talk mediated by EphA4 and ephrinA3 is also involved in regulating dendritic spine morphology ( Murai et al . 2003 , Carmona et al . 2009 ) . The effects of EphA4 on spine morphology can also be mediated by the regulation integrin signalling ( Bourgin et al . 2007 ) or alternatively by activating phospholipase gamma and causing actin rearrangement through cofilin ( Zhou et al . 2007 ) . NMDA - dependent ephrinA2 - signalling is required for maintaining spines and synapses , as ephrinA2 knockout mice show increased pruning of dendritic synapses ( Yu et al . 2013 ) . The ability of the Eph - ephrin system to employ different downstream effectors , integrate information from several signalling pathways , and provide fine - tuned responses into opposing cells via bidirectional signalling allows the control of important elements of synaptic development and physiology . Still , several molecular details of how specific signalling responses can be achieved and how diverse pathways with contrasting effects downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling intersect remain to be deciphered . As demonstrated by the examples from its physiological roles in the nervous system , the Eph - ephrin system can act as a versatile regulator of very distinct physiological responses . Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating Eph - ephrin signalling is therefore a key element in gaining a deeper understanding of a large host of different physiological processes . Introduction 18 1 . 2 Rho ‐ family GTPases The Rho family of GTPases is a subgroup of the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue ( Ras ) superfamily of GTPases and itself consists of several subfamilies . The Rho GTPases are relatively small proteins ( 21 kDa ) with their signature conserved GTPase domain residing in their N - terminus . They act as molecular switches and have been associated with several essential physiological functions including controlling cell morphology , polarisation , adhesion and migration , as well as vesicle trafficking ( Ridley 2006 , Iden & Collard 2008 , Friedl & Gilmour 2009 , Hall & Lalli 2010 , Parsons et al . 2010 ) . Rho family GTPases also play an important role in several diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders , neurodegeneration and cancer ( Sahai & Marshall 2002a , Govek et al . 2005 , Newey et al . 2005 , Parri & Chiarugi 2010 , Stankiewicz & Linseman 2014 ) . Already early reports on the functions of Rho family GTPases linked their effects on cell morphology and motility to rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton ( Ridley & Hall 1992a , Ridley & Hall 1992b , Ridley et al . 1992 ) . Subsequent studies revealed further roles for Rho family GTPases in controlling gene expression , mitosis , proliferation and secretion ( Etienne - Manneville & Hall 2002 , Jaffe & Hall 2002 , Heasman & Ridley 2008 ) . Although Rho family GTPase activity affects many intracellular processes , shaping the actin cytoskeleton has remained the focal point , and is particularly relevant in the context of the regulation of neurite morphology and endocytic processes ( Ridley 2006 , Hall & Lalli 2010 ) . Rho - family GTPases function as molecular switches . This ability arises from the distinct signalling properties they exhibit when in a guanine diphosphate ( GDP ) - bound or guanine triphosphate ( GTP ) - bound state . In their inactive , GDP - bound conformation , Rho family GTPases are mainly found in the cytosol and unable to bind their effector proteins ( Jaffe & Hall 2005 ) . When bound to GTP , Rho GTPases are in their active state and localised to membranes via a prenyl group connected to a conserved CAAX motif in their C - terminal part ( Roberts et al . 2008 ) . In their active state they are able to bind their respective effector proteins , often protein kinases such as PAK1 or Rho activated kinase ( ROCK ) ( Bishop & Hall 2000 ) . The transitioning between active and inactive states of Rho - family GTPases relies heavily on the interaction with three different classes of proteins : GEFs , GAPs , and guanine nucleotide - dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) ( Jaffe & Hall 2005 ) . GDIs can constrain Introduction 19 Rho GTPases in their inactive , GDP - bound state and regulate their subcellular location ( Olofsson 1999 ) . GEFs catalyse the exchange of GDP to GTP , thereby activating Rho GTPases ( Hart et al . 1991 , Schmidt & Hall 2002a ) , while GAPs greatly enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho GTPases , resulting in a transition to the inactive state ( Garrett et al . 1989 , Lamarche & Hall 1994 , Tcherkezian & Lamarche - Vane 2007 ) . The activity of both GEFs and GAPs can be regulated downstream of extracellular cues and they are therefore key regulators of Rho GTPase signalling and important mediators of cross - talk between different pathways ( Bos et al . 2007 ) . The physiological importance of GEFs and GAPs is further highlighted by the fact that both groups of proteins outnumber the 20 members of the Rho - family of GTPases several fold . The Rho GTPase cycle and the role of GEFs and GAPs is summarised in Figure 2A . In this chapter I will provide a short overview of the different subfamilies of Rho GTPases and their relevant functions , a more detailed description of the properties and functions of GEFs and GAPs , as well as an overview of Rho family GTPase signalling downstream of Eph - ephrin complexes . 1 . 2 . 1 Rho GTPase subfamilies Rho family GTPases are highly conserved in eukaryotes and can be found in organisms ranging from yeast to plants to animals . In mammals , a total of 20 Rho family GTPases have been described and they can be divided into 6 - 8 distinct subfamilies according to their sequence similarity ( see also Fig . 2B ) ( Burridge & Wennerberg 2004 , Wennerberg & Der 2004 , Heasman & Ridley 2008 ) . Most studies so far have focussed on the three cardinal members of the Rho family GTPases : RhoA , Rac and Cdc42 . Rho - family GTPases not falling into one of these three subfamilies are therefore often referred to as atypical Rho GTPases . 1 . 2 . 1 . 1 RhoA subfamily The eponymous RhoA subfamily consists of RhoA , RhoB and RhoC . Traditionally RhoA has been linked to assembly of actin stress fibres and focal adhesions ( Ridley & Hall 1992b , Nobes & Hall 1995 ) . The effect on stress fibre assembly , however , does not rely on a large increase in actin polymerisation downstream of RhoA , but rather on myosin - induced Introduction 20 bundling of actin ( Machesky & Hall 1997 ) . To this end , RhoA activates ROCK , its most commonly studied downstream effector ( Leung et al . 1995 ) . One of the chief functions of ROCK signalling is phosphorylation of myosin , which thus facilitates the formation of stress fibres ( Amano et al . 1996 , Kimura et al . 1996 ) . ROCK signalling downstream of RhoA can also affect the actin cytoskeleton more directly , for example through phosphorylation of Lim kinase , which phosphorylates the actin - binding protein cofilin , culminating in stress fibre formation . ( Maekawa et al . 1999 ) . RhoA subfamily proteins can also interact with actin nucleator proteins of the Dia family , which opens up possibilities for both shared and distinct signalling pathways with ROCK downstream of RhoA ( Watanabe et al . 1999 , Sahai & Marshall 2002b , Lammers et al . 2008 ) . Due to the high degree in sequence homology between the three subfamily members and their ability to bind the same effectors , the various Rho family members have overlapping and often redundant functions in some physiological contexts . RhoA and RhoB are both required for lamellipodia retraction in macrophages , with only double knockout mice showing a strong phenotype ( Konigs et al . 2014 ) . In differentiation of skin cells , RhoA - deficient mice displayed only a mild phenotype with increased cell spreading and defective cell - cell contacts in vitro , while RhoB expression was increased ( Jackson et al . 2011 ) . Additional pharmacological inhibition of RhoB and RhoC greatly exacerbated the phenotype , suggesting functional overlap between the RhoA subfamily members . Nonetheless , differences in the signalling properties of the different subfamily members have also emerged . RhoB differs in its subcellular location from RhoA and RhoC and seems to mediate different signalling responses , including regulation of vesicular trafficking ( Adamson et al . 1992 , Gampel et al . 1999 , Michaelson et al . 2001 ) . RhoC shows higher binding affinity to ROCK when compared with RhoA , enabling the two proteins to activate distinct signalling pathways within the same cell ( Sahai & Marshall 2002b ) . Physiologically , signalling from RhoA subfamily members is important for actin rearrangement in neuronal development and axon guidance , as it can mediate growth cone collapse and regulate neurite growth ( Wahl et al . 2000 , Shamah et al . 2001 , Fournier et al . 2003 , Sahin et al . 2005 , Takeuchi et al . 2015 ) . Introduction 21 Figure 2 . Rho family GTPases ( A ) Rho family GTPase activity cycle . Rho family GTPases cycle between a GDP ‐ bound , inactive and a GTP ‐ bound , active state . The transition between these stages is mediated by guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase ‐ activating proteins ( GAPs ) . Active GTPases bind downstream effectors to mediate their signalling response , for example remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton . ( B ) Evolutionary relationship between different Rho family GTPases and their respective subfamilies according to sequence alignment with Phylogeny software ( www . phylogeny . fr ) ( Dereeper et al . 2008 ) . Introduction 22 1 . 2 . 1 . 2 Rac subfamily The Rac subfamily consists of Rac1 , Rac2 , Rac3 and their distant relative RhoG ( Figure 2 B ) . A further splice variant of Rac1 , Rac1b , with very efficient intrinsic GTP - GDP exchange and therefore thought to be constitutively active , has also been described ( Fiegen et al . 2004 ) . Rac was first shown to be an important mediator in the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in response to extracellular signals such as growth factors ( Ridley et al . 1992 , Nobes & Hall 1995 ) . Changes in the cytoskeleton induced by Rac result from an increased polymerisation of actin ( Machesky & Hall 1997 ) . Later , Rac subfamily members have also emerged as key regulators of endocytic processes including macropinocytosis ( Dharmawardhane et al . 2000 , West et al . 2000 ) and phagocytosis ( Massol et al . 1998 , Castellano et al . 2000 , Chimini & Chavrier 2000 , Hoppe & Swanson 2004 ) . The contribution of Rac subfamily signalling to endocytic pathways , and more specifically , endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes will be explored in greater detail in chapter 1 . 3 . The separate Rac subfamily members vary in their expression patterns : While Rac1 is expressed ubiquitously , Rac2 is mainly found in hematopoietic cells ( Roberts et al . 1999 ) and Rac3 is mainly expressed in the nervous system ( Haataja et al . 1997 ) . Rac1 and Rac2 have both overlapping and distinct signalling functions , as Rac1 and Rac2 single knockout mice show distinct phenotypes in hematopoietic cell regulation ( Gu et al . 2003 ) , while both Rac1 and Rac2 are required for B cell development ( Walmsley et al . 2003 ) . Rac1 and Rac3 have been found to have redundant functions in neuronal development ( Corbetta et al . 2009 ) . Finally , the function and role of RhoG signalling is still a matter of debate , but it has been proposed to act upstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 , positively regulating their activity via interaction with GEFs of the DOCK family ( Katoh & Negishi 2003 , Hiramoto et al . 2006 , Katoh et al . 2006 , Kim et al . 2011 , Franke et al . 2012 ) . However , other studies suggest RhoG can signal in parallel to Cdc42 and Rac , making use of the same downstream effectors ( Wennerberg et al . 2002 ) . One important downstream effector of Rac subfamily GTPases is the p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) , a serine / threonine kinase ( Manser et al . 1994 , Knaus et al . 1998 ) . Via activating PAK , Rac can induce changes in the actin cytoskeleton required for cell motility and Introduction 23 neurite morphology ( Edwards et al . 1999 , Sells et al . 1999 , Nikolic 2008 ) . However , Rac activity can also lead to actin rearrangement independent of PAK by a pathway involving the adaptor protein Nck and the Scar / WAVE ( WASP - family verpolin homologous protein ) complex ( Eden et al . 2002 ) . Interestingly , activity of Rac subfamily GTPases is in many physiological situations opposed to the function of RhoA subfamily proteins and in some cases , leads to direct inhibition or downregulation of RhoA signalling ( Sander et al . 1999 , Nimnual et al . 2003 ) . In turn , RhoA activity and signalling via ROCK has been shown to lead to a decrease in Rac activity , which can be mediated through activation of Rac - specific GAPs ( Ohta et al . 2006 ) . Furthermore , signalling through the same receptor can influence Rac and Rho activity in contrasting directions ( Driessens et al . 2001 , Hu et al . 2001 , Sahin et al . 2005 ) . More recently , RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 have been shown to act synergistically , but in a tightly orchestrated manner in the formation of cell protrusions : RhoA is required at the leading edge of the cell to initiate actin rearrangement , while Rac1 and Cdc42 show peak activity 2 µm from the cell edge and are active with a delay compared to RhoA . This shows a spatio - temporally controlled sequence of activity of the respective GTPases and the authors speculate that since RhoA and Rac1 / Cdc42 activity are temporally and locally exclusive , cross - inhibition is important for this tight regulation ( Machacek et al . 2009 , Pertz 2010 ) . It has thus become increasingly obvious that signalling pathways from different Rho subfamilies intersect and influence each other ( Guilluy et al . 2011 ) . 1 . 2 . 1 . 3 Cdc42 subfamily The Cdc42 subfamily consists of five members : Cdc42 , RhoQ ( TC10 ) , RhoJ ( TCL ) , RhoU ( Wrch ) and RhoV ( Wrch2 / Chip ) ( Figure 2B ) . However , there is some debate whether RhoU and RhoV are actually a distinct subfamily , given that they show unique properties when compared to other Cdc42 subfamily proteins , including being potentially constitutively active ( Shutes et al . 2006 ) . Cdc42 activity induces long , filamentous processes called filopodia to be formed in cells ( Nobes & Hall 1995 ) . This function is shared by the other subfamily members , which can possibly be explained by their shared affinity towards some downstream effectors like PAK ( Aronheim et al . 1998 , Neudauer et al . 1998 , Murphy et al . 1999 , Tao et al . 2001 , Aspenstrom et al . 2004 ) . Nonetheless , Introduction 24 subsequent studies also revealed distinct signalling pathways and showed that Cdc42 subfamily members differ in their intracellular localisation , their sensitivity to regulation by GDIs and the respective downstream effects mediated ( Michaelson et al . 2001 , Murphy et al . 2001 ) . Furthermore , despite the high level of sequence homology between RhoQ , RhoJ and Cdc42 , GEFs seem to only marginally increase GTP - GDP exchange rates in RhoQ and RhoJ , while some of them are very potent activators of Cdc42 ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) . One key downstream effector of Cdc42 signalling to the actin cytoskeleton is Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , which mediates actin polymerisation and is involved in the formation of Cdc42 - induced filopodia ( Symons et al . 1996 ) . RhoQ and RhoJ , as well as RhoV can also induce filopodia formation via WASP ( Aronheim et al . 1998 , Abe et al . 2003 ) . However , a WASP - independent pathway for inducing filopodia by Cdc42 has also been described ( Peng et al . 2003 ) . WASP mediates rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton via the Arp2 / 3 complex , which induces actin branching ( Stradal & Scita 2006 ) . Another important pathway for Cdc42 subfamily GTPases uses PAK to regulate the actin cytoskeleton in an analogous fashion to Rac subfamily GTPases ( Manser et al . 1995 , Aronheim et al . 1998 , Edwards et al . 1999 ) . Signalling from Cdc42 via the WASP signalling pathway has been shown to be involved in both regulation of neurite morphology ( Wong et al . 2001 , Irie & Yamaguchi 2002 , Abe et al . 2003 , Nishimura et al . 2006 , Franke et al . 2012 ) and endocytic processes ( Hussain et al . 2001 , Qualmann & Kessels 2002 , Sabharanjak et al . 2002 , Chadda et al . 2007 ) , and is therefore highly relevant in the context of this study . 1 . 2 . 1 . 4 Atypical Rho family GTPases A more specialised subfamily of Rho GTPases are the Rnd proteins ( Rnd1 , Rd2 , Rnd3 / RhoE ) . Despite sequence homology with RhoA , the mechanism of action of the Rnd subfamily of proteins seems to differ significantly from the archetypical Rho family GTPases ( Foster et al . 1996 , Fiegen et al . 2002 , Garavini et al . 2002 , Chardin 2006 ) . Rnd proteins cannot act as molecular switches , since they are GTPase - deficient and are constitutively active in their GTP - bound form ( Foster et al . 1996 , Fiegen et al . 2002 , Garavini et al . 2002 ) . Nonetheless , Rnd proteins have been shown to regulate the actin Introduction 25 cytoskeleton ( Nobes et al . 1998 , Aspenstrom et al . 2004 ) . They can act as RhoA - antagonists by activating p190RhoGAP and their activity is regulated by a feedback - loop involving RhoA - activated kinase ( ROCK ) ( Wennerberg et al . 2003 , Riento et al . 2005 , Goh & Manser 2012 ) . As RhoA - antagonists , they have been shown to play a role in axon guidance , for example downstream of semaphorin signalling ( Oinuma et al . 2004a , Oinuma et al . 2004b , Pacary et al . 2011 ) . Another pair of unusual Rho - family GTPases are RhoD and Rif , in that they seem not to be regulated by GEFs , like most other Rho - family GTPases ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) . This may be because RhoD and Rif display a very high intrinsic exchange rate from GDP to GTP and are proposed to thus be constitutively active , similar to the splice variant Rac1b ( Fiegen et al . 2004 , Jaiswal et al . 2013b ) . Functionally , RhoD and Rif have been shown to induce rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and be involved in vesicular transport , among other functions ( Murphy et al . 1996 , Gasman et al . 2003 , Aspenstrom et al . 2004 , Gad & Aspenstrom 2010 ) . RhoH is an atypical Rho GTPase and just like the Rnd subfamily , it lacks a key residue in its GTPase domain , rendering it incapable of GTP hydrolysis ( Li et al . 2002 ) . While RhoH is not involved in rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton , in contrast to most other members of the Rho family GTPases ( Aspenstrom et al . 2004 ) , it has been implicated to play an important role in some cancers ( Preudhomme et al . 2000 ) . A likely mechanism for its function is binding and inhibition of other Rho family GTPases ( Li et al . 2002 ) . The Rho BTB subfamily , which consists of three members ( RhoBTB1 - 3 ) differs from other Rho family GTPases in that they contain additional domains in their C - terminus , lack the CAAX - motif important for membrane localisation , and are also unable to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton ( Rivero et al . 2001 , Aspenstrom et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , RhoBTB3 has an atypical GTPase domain and is thought to bind ATP instead of GTP ( Espinosa et al . 2009 ) . A final subfamily of Rho GTPases that shows no effects on the cytoskeleton is the Miro subfamily , consisting of members Miro1 and Miro2 , which have been shown to localise to mitochondria and to be involved in regulation of apoptosis ( Fransson et al . 2003 , Aspenstrom et al . 2004 ) . However , due to large sequence divergence from all other Rho Introduction 26 family GTPases , it is questionable whether they should be included in the Rho family at all ( Fransson et al . 2003 ) . Despite this great variety of GTPases , research so far has mainly focussed on just three proteins : RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 . Given that these three subfamilies have been implicated already in Eph - ephrin signalling and endocytic processes ( see below ) and the fact that their regulatory mechanisms are accessible for experimental manipulation , we also focussed on their role in EphB - ephrinB endocytosis in this study . When studying the effects of Rho GTPases it will be important to bear in mind that there is a degree of physiological redundancy within different subfamilies of Rho GTPases , as well as regulatory cross - talk within and between subfamilies . 1 . 2 . 2 Regulation of Rho subfamily GTPases by GEFs and GAPs 1 . 2 . 2 . 1 Regulation through GEFs There are two major families of GEFs for Rho family GTPases in eukaryotes : the Diffuse B - cell lymphoma oncogene ( Dbl ) family and the Dedicator of Cytokinesis ( DOCK ) - family . The Dbl family all share the eponymous Dbl Homology ( DH ) domain that is crucial for mediating guanine nucleotide exchange ( Hart et al . 1991 ) . For most Dbl family GEFs , the DH domain is paired with a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , involved in binding the target GTPase ( Rossman et al . 2002 ) , or membrane localisation of GEFs through lipid binding ( Ferguson et al . 1995 , Lemmon & Ferguson 2000 , Razzini et al . 2000 ) . There are 74 proteins containing a DH encoded by the human genome , but not all of them display GEF activity towards Rho - family GTPases ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) . In addition to the signature DH - PH tandem domains , GEFs can contain a great variety of domains involved in signalling or protein - protein interaction , amongst them SH2 , SH3 , GEF domains for other GTPases such as Ras , PDZ or Kinase domains . This assortment of diverse interaction sites enables GEFs to integrate signals from , and confer signals to a host of different signalling pathways ( Schmidt & Hall 2002a ) . Introduction 27 Specificity of GEFs for distinct Rho - family GTPases covers a broad spectrum . A comprehensive study by Jaisawal and colleagues tested several GEFs for their catalytic activity towards a large number of Rho - family GTPases in vitro . Their results suggested that while some Dbl family GEFs do not show any activity towards the tested GTPases , others are active on several of them , for example , Prex1 that confers activity to members of all three cardinal Rho subfamilies , some are subfamily specific , for example , p190GEF for the RhoA subfamily ; and yet others are highly specific for a single GTPase , for example , ITSN for Cdc42 ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) . The study further revealed that the catalytic efficiency with which GEFs mediate GDP to GTP - exchange in GTPases can vary greatly , as it ranges from 5 - fold to 60 , 000 - fold increase over baseline intrinsic exchange activity ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) . These facts suggest that different GEFs can affect Rho GTPase activity at different time scales and with different efficiencies . Interestingly , the results reported in this comprehensive study sometimes contradict previous reports in the literature regarding the specificity of some GEFs . For example , Prex1 had previously been described as a Rac - specific GEF ( Welch et al . 2002 ) , whereas Jaiswal and colleagues show that it also has significant activity towards members of the RhoA and Cdc42 subfamilies . However , some of these discrepancies can potentially be explained by this study relying solely on in vitro studies , while posttranslational modifications , interaction with GDIs , or subcellular compartmentalisation in vivo may significantly change the activity of GEFs , as can be observed in the case of ephexin changing its specificity upon phosphorylation ( Sahin et al . 2005 ) . GEF activity can be regulated in several ways ( Schmidt & Hall 2002a ) . A very important regulatory mechanism for GEFs is phosphorylation by protein kinases ( Patel & Karginov 2014 ) . For example , the Vav family of Rho GEFs has been shown to be present in the cell in an auto - inhibited confirmation that is relieved upon tyrosine phosphorylation by SFKs ( Aghazadeh et al . 2000 , Yu et al . 2010 ) . Combined with the possibility of Vav proteins being de - phosphorylated by phosphatases ( Stebbins et al . 2003 , Sastry et al . 2006 ) , the phosphorylation status of Vav provides tight and transient spatio - temporal control for its activity . While phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases correlates with higher GEF activity , phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues can be either inhibitory or activating . One example of this is GEF - H1 ( ArhGEF2 ) that can be activated upon phosphorylation of a Introduction 28 threonine residue by Extracellular signal - Regulated Kinase ( ERK ) , while a different phosphorylation event mediated by ERK on a serine residue inhibits its function , as does serine phosphorylation by PAK ( Zenke et al . 2004 , Fujishiro et al . 2008 , von Thun et al . 2013 ) . Finally , a remarkable effect of phosphorylation is observed in ephexin ( NGEF ) , downstream of EphA4 receptor signalling , where the preference of GEF activity switches from Rac1 / Cdc42 to RhoA upon phosphorylation ( Sahin et al . 2005 ) . Aside from phosphorylation , there are multiple other mechanisms regulating GEF activity . One such pathway involves GPCRs . Synaptic GPCR Brain - specific Angiogenesis Inhibitor 1 ( BAI1 ) is required for restricting Rac - specific GEF Tiam1 to synapses in synaptogenesis by direct interaction , thereby leading to the localised Rac activation necessary for establishing polarity ( Duman et al . 2013 ) . GPCR signalling is not only required for correct localisation of GEFs , but can also directly increase GEF activity . G  activates p63GEF ( GEFT ) by directly binding to the PH domain , which leads to a release of auto - inhibition ( Rojas et al . 2007 ) .  G  and phosphatidylinositol signalling can directly and synergistically increase GEF - activity of Prex1 , which enables Prex1 to act as a coincidence detector of these two signalling pathways in neutrophils ( Welch et al . 2002 ) . A unique feature of GPCR signalling via GEFs can be observed with Trio , a GEF containing two separate DH - PH domains showing distinct substrate specificity towards RhoA and Rac1 / Cdc42 , respectively ( Debant et al . 1996 ) . The RhoA - specific DH - PH domain of Trio shares sequence similarity with the DH - PH domain from p63GEF and accordingly , G  - interaction through the same molecular mechanism leads to increased GEF activity towards RhoA and an associate shift away from activity towards Cdc42 and Rac1 ( Rojas et al . 2007 ) . The DOCK family of GEFs has been discovered more recently and displays different characteristics when compared to Dbl family GEFs ( Cote & Vuori 2002 ) . Since they lack the DH domain , DOCKs are often referred to as atypical GEFs . Instead of the DH domain , DOCK proteins share two separate DOCK homology regions , DHR1 and DHR2 , from which they mediate lipid binding and induce GEF activity ( Laurin & Cote 2014 ) . The DOCK family consists of 11 members and interestingly , they all show specificity for either Rac or Cdc42 GTPases and are not active towards RhoA ( Cote & Vuori 2002 , Cote & Introduction 29 Vuori 2006 ) . DOCK - family GEFs are also different from Dbl family GEFs in that at least some members rely on interaction with members of the Engulfment and cell motility protein ( ELMO ) family in order to exhibit nucleotide exchange activity . This interaction , first described between Dock1 ( also known as DOCK180 ) and ELMO1 , leads to Rac activation ( Wu et al . 2001 , Brugnera et al . 2002 , Grimsley et al . 2004 , Lu et al . 2004 ) . Dock4 has also been shown to require interaction with an ELMO protein to influence cell migration via Rac activation ( Hiramoto et al . 2006 ) and an ELMO2 - Dock3 complex is required for neurite outgrowth downstream of neurotrophic factor signalling ( Namekata et al . 2012 ) . However , it is not yet completely understood whether all DOCK proteins require complex formation with ELMOs to exhibit GEF activity . Furthermore , activation of Rac by the DOCK - ELMO complex on is regulated by another GTPase , RhoG , which seems to be important for translocation of the DOCK - Elmo complex to the cell membrane ( Katoh & Negishi 2003 , Hiramoto et al . 2006 , Katoh et al . 2006 , Namekata et al . 2012 ) . A second regulatory mechanism for DOCK proteins is the formation of dimers . Homodimers of Dock9 or Dock1 have been reported to display increased GEF activity ( Meller et al . 2004 ) . Further research has also provided evidence of heterodimers between Dock1 and Dock5 and suggested ELMO proteins act as scaffold proteins for DOCK - family dimers ( Patel et al . 2011 ) . Recently DOCK proteins , and the DOCK - ELMO - RhoG signalling axis in particular , have emerged as important players in regulating neurite morphology , complexity and spine formation through effects on the actin cytoskeleton ( Kim et al . 2011 , Franke et al . 2012 , Namekata et al . 2012 ) . Also phagocytic uptake of apoptotic cells in C . elegans also employs a DOCK - ELMO complex downstream of RhoG , which is in turn activated by the Dbl - GEF Trio ( deBakker et al . 2004 ) . In conclusion , it has become evident that GEFs are not only key regulators of GTPase activity , but due to their ability to interact with and be regulated by different signalling pathways also constitute a versatile mediator of signalling cross - talk . 1 . 2 . 2 . 2 Regulation through GAPs GAPs are highly conserved in eukaryotes and can be found in organisms ranging from yeast to humans ( Peck et al . 2002 ) . Between 60 and 70 different proteins containing a Rho GAP domain are encoded in the human genome but not all of them have been functionally Introduction 30 described yet ( Tcherkezian & Lamarche - Vane 2007 ) . Initially thought of as mere signal terminators of Rho GTPase signalling , by now many pivotal roles for GAP proteins have been described , including intersection with other signalling pathways as well as signalling functions not mediated by the Rho GAP domain . The key feature GAP proteins have in common is their signature Rho GAP domain , which enhances the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho GTPases upon binding by the GAP to the GTPase ( Peck et al . 2002 ) . A conserved arginine residue within the Rho GAP domain is essential for its catalytic function , but not mandatory for the initial binding between GAP and GTPase ( Graham et al . 1999 ) . A notable exception to this rule is the Rac - specific GAP oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe ( OCRL - 1 ) , which displays low GAP activity despite lacking the conserved arginine residue in its GAP domain ( Faucherre et al . 2003 ) . Apart from the common RhoGAP domain , GAPs may contain a great variety of different interaction domains including PDZ , SAM , SH2 , SH3 , BAR and DH - PH domains , thus enabling them to make use of , and contribute to , several distinct signalling mechanisms and pathways ( Peck et al . 2002 , Tcherkezian & Lamarche - Vane 2007 ) . An example highlighting the importance of GAPs independent of their GAP activity can be found in TCGAP , which regulates insulin - dependent glucose uptake via interactions with RhoQ despite not being catalytically active in cellulo ( Chiang et al . 2003 ) . There are significant differences between GAPs regarding their specificity towards single Rho family GTPases or subfamilies . Studies have shown that some GAPs are specifically active towards single GTPases or at least GTPase subfamilies , for example p190GAP for RhoA ( Ridley et al . 1993 ) and ARHGAP15 for Rac ( Seoh et al . 2003 ) . Some GAPs display an intermediate level of specificity and are active towards members of two of the main Rho subfamilies , but not towards the third . For example , CdGAP is active towards Cdc42 and Rac1 , but not towards RhoA ( Tcherkezian et al . 2006 ) . Other GAPs , however , show a broad range of activity towards several GTPases , for example RICS and OPHN1 that both show activity towards Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA ( Billuart et al . 1998 , Nakamura et al . 2002 , Fauchereau et al . 2003 , Moon et al . 2003 ) . Identifying the specificity of GAPs towards single GTPases is challenging , as studies often only test the activity towards their GTPase of interest , or towards Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA ( being the most - studied Rho GTPases ) , and very few comprehensive studies exist . Furthermore , there seem to be significant differences Introduction 31 between the specificity GAPs display in vitro compared to observations in vivo ( Tcherkezian & Lamarche - Vane 2007 ) . Often there are also conflicting reports about the specificity of certain GAPs , as is the case for Slit / ROBO GAP1 ( SrGAP1 ) , which was originally reported to interact with Cdc42 and RhoA , but not Rac1 in vivo ( Wong et al . 2001 ) , but a more recent study reported activity mainly towards Rac1 ( Yamazaki et al . 2013 ) . Potentially , these contradictory findings can be explained by post - translational modifications , which can influence specificity in different cellular contexts ( ( Minoshima et al . 2003 ) . A subset of GAPs , but not all of them , show tissue specific expression . One example is RICS ( also known as Grit ) , which is only expressed in the brain , where it contributes to neurite extension downstream of TrkA ( Nakamura et al . 2002 , Moon et al . 2003 ) . Regulation of GAP activity is often mediated through phosphorylation by protein kinases . Kinase - regulated pathways include signalling by SFKs fyn and src ( Roof et al . 1998 , Liu et al . 2006 ) , signalling downstream of synaptic activity through calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CamKII ) ( Okabe et al . 2003 ) and cytokinetic signalling through Aurora B ( Minoshima et al . 2003 ) . GAPs are also involved in mitogenic signalling . CdGAP is phosphorylated at an important regulatory site by ERK1 ( Tcherkezian et al . 2005 ) and another GAP , RhoA - specific Gmip , interacts with Ras GTPases , themselves important players in mitogenic signalling ( Aresta et al . 2002 ) . As with GEFs , phosphorylation can have very varied effects on GAP activity : it can lead to an increase in GAP activity ( Roof et al . 1998 , Ohta et al . 2006 ) , it can inhibit activity ( Okabe et al . 2003 , Tcherkezian et al . 2005 ) or very interestingly , lead to a change in substrate specificity , as for example in the case of male germ cell Rac GAP ( MgcRacGAP ) , which switches its specificity from Rac1 and Cdc42 to RhoA after phosphorylation ( Minoshima et al . 2003 ) . A similar switch has also been reported for SrGAP1 downstream of Roundabout receptor ( ROBO ) signalling , increasing its activity towards Cdc42 , while downregulating GAP activity towards RhoA ( Wong et al . 2001 ) . GAPs are also regulated downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling , as detailed in the section below . GAPs also provide a target for cross - talk between different subfamilies of Rho GTPases . Filamin A – associated Rho GAP ( FilGAP ) is a Rac GAP that gets phosphorylated Introduction 32 downstream of ROCK leading to an increase in its activity ( Ohta et al . 2006 ) . CdGAP experiences inhibition of its Rac GAP activity when bound by ITSN1 , a Cdc42 - GEF ( Jenna et al . 2002 ) . Bcr contains both a Rho GAP and a Rho GEF domain and has been shown to simultaneously inhibit Rac1 and promote Cdc42 signalling in vivo ( Ridley et al . 1993 , Korus et al . 2002 ) . Finally , GAPs can also be downregulated by degradation through the proteasome after ubiquitination ( Su et al . 2003 ) . These examples underline the importance of regulation of GTPase activity by GAPs and highlight that GAPs play just as central a role as GEFs in integrating information from different signalling pathways . 1 . 2 . 3 Eph ‐ ephrin signalling through Rho ‐ family GTPases Many important functions of Eph - ephrin signalling rely heavily on processes involving rearrangement of the cytoskeleton . Therefore it is not surprising that Rho - family GTPases and their regulating GEFs and GAPs have emerged as key effectors in Eph - ephrin signalling . Growth cone collapse in neurons can be initiated by RhoA signalling ( Lehmann et al . 1999 , Dergham et al . 2002 ) . Experiments with retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs ) have shown that RhoA - dependent growth cone collapse is triggered downstream of EphA activation by ephrinA5 ( Wahl et al . 2000 ) . This signalling pathway uses ROCK downstream of RhoA to induce actin - myosin - based contraction and also seems to negatively regulate Rac1 signalling . Another study , however , showed Rac1 signalling downstream of ephrinA2 in RGCs to be crucial for correct formation of retino - tectal projections ( Jurney et al . 2002 ) . The role of Rac1 in growth cone collapse downstream of ephrinA - EphA signalling is linked to its ability to promote endocytic uptake ( Fournier et al . 2000 , Jurney et al . 2002 ) . Recently the RhoA - ROCK pathway has also been shown to be responsible for growth cone collapse downstream of ephrinB reverse signalling induced by ectodomains of EphB2 ( Takeuchi et al . 2015 ) . A very interesting feature of EphA forward signalling mediated by RhoA is the effect EphA activation has on the RhoGEF ephexin ( NGEF ) in neurons . As described previously , phosphorylation of ephexin by EphA receptors leads to a change in its catalytic specificity - decreasing its ability to activate Cdc42 and Rac1 , while increasing its activity towards RhoA - thereby activating the RhoA - ROCK pathway and leading to growth cone Introduction 33 collapse ( Shamah et al . 2001 , Sahin et al . 2005 ) . Another GEF that has increased activity towards RhoA after phosphorylation by EphA4 is ArhGEF15 . It is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and modulates vascular contractility by contributing to actin stress fibre formation ( Ogita et al . 2003 ) . Finally , a shift in balance away from Cdc42 and towards RhoA activity downstream of ephrinA - EphA signalling is also responsible for inhibiting chemotaxis in T - lymphocytes , but whether this signalling pathway also operates through phosphorylation of a GEF is not yet known ( Sharfe et al . 2002 ) . The function of Rho family GTPases is also important for the role of Eph - ephrin signalling in the formation of the motor system . EphrinB3 - EphA4 signalling in the spinal cord is important for the correct formation of central pattern generators . Correct axon guidance decisions for the development of this locomotor circuit require growth cone collapse mediated by  2 - chimaerin , a Rac GAP , which gets activated upon binding to active EphA4 clusters ( Beg et al . 2007 , Iwasato et al . 2007 , Wegmeyer et al . 2007 ) . This interaction is potentially facilitated by the adaptor protein Grb4 ( also known as Nck2 ) , as mice deficient for Nck1 and Grb4 show the same phenotype as  2 - chimaerin or EphA4 knockout mice ( Fawcett et al . 2007 ) . In contrast to  2 - chimaerin - induced inhibition of Rac1 activity causing growth cone collapse in spinal motor neurons , in RGCs growth cone collapse and correct axon guidance occurs after activated Ephs phosphorylate and thereby activate Vav family GEFs , which , in turn , activate Rac ( Cowan et al . 2005 ) . Moreover , the work of Cowan and colleagues presents a potential explanation for the seemingly opposing roles of Eph - Rac signalling plays in growth cone collapse : the authors link Vav and Rac function to endocytosis of Eph - ephrin clusters , which is thought to be required for cell detachment . The endocytic uptake possibly requires localised activation of Rac , whereas the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton of the growth cone in general requires a reduction in Rac activity . As the mechanisms of Eph - ephrin endocytosis are seminal to this dissertation , they will be discussed in greater depth in section X . Rac activity has also been implicated in repulsive guidance and axon pruning downstream of reverse signalling by ephrinB3 . Effective signalling requires phosphorylation of ephrinB3 , which enables Grb4 to bind to its cytoplasmic tail . Grb4 in turn can bind Dock1 Introduction 34 and the Rac downstream effector PAK and together , this signalling cascade regulates the actin dynamics necessary for growth cone collapse ( Xu & Henkemeyer 2009 ) . For the effects on dendrite morphology mediated by Eph - eprin signalling , Rac and Cdc42 signalling downstream of EphB2 has been reported to be important . A signalling axis involving EphB2 , Cdc42 , the Cdc42 - specific GEF ITSN and neuronal Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) , a regulator of actin polymerisation , has been shown to be required for the formation and maturation of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons ( Irie & Yamaguchi 2002 , Nishimura et al . 2006 ) . Experiments indicated that Cdc42 activity is required for spine formation and that ITSN displayed greater GEF activity when bound by EphB2 or N - WASP . A complex of EphB2 , N - WASP and ITSN resulted in an even larger increase in GEF activity , which suggests a synergistic effect of N - WASP and EphB2 binding on ITSN . Another GEF involved in dendrite morphogenesis is Kalirin ( Penzes et al . 2000 , Penzes et al . 2001 ) . Kalirin localises to EphB2 clusters activated by ephrinB1 and is subsequently phosphorylated ( Penzes et al . 2003 ) . Rac activity is increased by Kalirin and in turn , leads to an increase in the activity of its downstream effector PAK , which mediates the localised actin rearrangement required for dendritic spine morphogenesis ( Penzes et al . 2003 ) . Another pathway employed by both EphA and EphB activated by ephrinBs to regulate dendrite morphogenesis uses the Rac - specific GEF Tiam1 to induce Rac activity ( Tanaka et al . 2004 , Tolias et al . 2007 ) . Tiam1 is recruited to , and phosphorylated by ephrinB - induced EphB2 receptor clusters , and this activation is necessary for spine development ( Tolias et al . 2007 ) . The presence of NMDA receptors at EphB2 clusters and the previous established link between synaptic activity and Tiam1 signalling suggests that there is a connection between synaptic activity and EphB2 - regulated dendrite morphogenesis ( Tolias et al . 2005 , Tolias et al . 2007 ) . More recent work proposed that Tiam1 forms a complex with the Rac GAP Bcr in this context , which allows precise and tight spatio - temporal regulation of Rac activity to regulate synaptogenesis downstream of EphB receptors ( Um et al . 2014 ) . A finely tuned balance in Rac activity is required , as inhibition of Bcr function leads to both aberrant synaptic overgrowth due to increased Tiam1 - induced Rac activity and increased spine - loss induced by ephrinB1 due to increased internalisation of ephrinB1 - EphB clusters . Tiam1 has also been implicated in the endocytosis of EphAs and it has been proposed to mediate signalling from Eph receptor Introduction 35 clusters residing in endosomal compartments ( Yoo et al . 2010 , Boissier et al . 2013 ) . A detailed description of the mechanisms of Eph - ephrin endocytosis is provided in chapter 1 . 3 . 3 . A different role for Tiam1 activity downstream of ephrinB2 reverse signalling has been reported by Adams and colleagues for vascular smooth muscle cells . Here , ephrinB2 reverse signalling regulates Tiam1 activity , as well as localisation towards the cell membrane and sites of platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) internalisation . Both PDGFR internalisation and Tiam1 - induced Rac activity are required for correct vessel wall formation ( Nakayama et al . 2013 ) . Spine morphogenesis and synapse formation can also be mediated by ephrinB reverse signalling . Experiments in cultured rat hippocampal neurons have shown a signalling pathway involving Grb4 , GIT1 ,  Pix , Rac and PAK to be required for the formation of dendritic spines and synapses downstream of ephrinBs ( Zhang et al . 2005 , Segura et al . 2007 ) . Phosphorylation of ephrinBs is required , which in turn leads to localisation of GIT1 to synaptic compartments and binding of Grb4 ( Segura et al . 2007 ) . The GIT1 - Grb4 complex recruits the GEF  Pix , which activates Rac1 and thereby PAK . This signalling cascade leads to an increase in phosphorylation of myosin light chain II ( MLC2 ) , which is required for the effects on dendrite morphology ( Zhang et al . 2005 ) . In conclusion , Rho - family GTPases and their regulatory GEFs and GAPs are well - established players in Eph - ephrin signalling and are instrumental for actin rearrangement - driven changes in cell morphology and motility , for example in growth cone collapse and spine morphology . Furthermore , they seem to be pivotal elements in Eph - ephrin endocytosis , however , their precise contribution still remains to be deciphered . The large number of GEFs and GAPs and their overlapping specificities also provide a high level of redundancy in the system , as can be seen in the role of Eph - ephrin signalling in dendrite morphogenesis , where both a Tiam1 - Rac and an ITSN - Cdc42 pathway have been described . Studying the involvement of GEFs and GAPs in Eph - ephrin signalling therefore needs to address the potential redundant roles of GTPases and their regulators . Introduction 36 1 . 3 Endocytosis The term endocytosis derives from the Greek words endos ( into ) and cytos ( “hollow vessel” = cell ) and is used to describe the cellular processes that mediate the up - take of molecules , membranes , liquids , or larger components into a cell . Being able to internalise external material into a cell is of vital importance for many physiological functions . Primarily thought to be required for the regulation of signalling responses and , especially , for the downregulation of signalling by the internalisation of cell surface receptors ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 , McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) , endocytosis is also important in the elimination of pathogens ( Flannagan et al . 2012 ) , in mediating changes of cellular morphology ( Donaldson et al . 2009 , Tojima et al . 2011 ) , and in synaptic signalling ( Royle & Lagnado 2010 ) . Furthermore , endocytic pathways are also used by viruses and other pathogens to infect cells and are therefore important in the context of several diseases ( Marsh & Helenius 2006 , Maxfield 2014 ) . Internalisation of cargo serves several purposes and can also result in differing outcomes . Once internalised , vesicles from several endocytic pathways are considered to first localise to the early endosomal compartment . From the early endosomal compartment different endocytic routes exist : either cargo is returned to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes , or it is sent for degradation via late endosomal and lysosomal compartments ( Alberts 2015 ) . The trafficking between these different endosomal compartments is tightly regulated by small GTPases of the Rab family ( Wandinger - Ness & Zerial 2014 ) . Different Rab GTPases are associated with distinct endosomal compartments . The best characterised ones are : Rab5 with the early endosome , Rab7 with the late endosome and Rab11 with the recycling endosome . After the discovery of recycling from endosomal compartments had challenged the original notion that endocytosis is only a mechanism for restricting and terminating signalling from cell surface receptors , further evidence for a more diverse physiological function of endocytosis came from the observation that some receptors remain active and continue signalling from inside the endosomal compartment after internalisation . Initially reports for epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signalling responses showed that the receptor stays active and phosphorylated and bound to its downstream effectors on endosomes ( Di Introduction 37 Guglielmo et al . 1994 , Baass et al . 1995 , Burke et al . 2001 ) . By now so - called signalling endosomes have also been described to occur after activation of several other RTKs including TrkA , TrkB and p75NTR ( Grimes et al . 1996 , Howe et al . 2001 , Barker et al . 2002 , Shao et al . 2002 , Saxena et al . 2005 ) . Endocytosis is thus a diverse process , which is not only important in many physiological contexts , but can also serve multiple purposes depending on the trafficking of cargo downstream of the initial internalisation event . 1 . 3 . 1 Endocytic pathways The term endocytosis encompasses a host of different processes , which differ significantly in their molecular mechanism and the kind of cargo they internalise . The distinction between these pathways is based on differences in ultrastructural appearance as revealed by electron microscopy , the type of cargo internalised , and the molecular mechanisms involved . Here I will provide a short overview of the most commonly described endocytic pathways . 1 . 3 . 1 . 1 Clathrin ‐ mediated endocytosis Perhaps the most intensively studied endocytic pathway is clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . In most cases CME is required for the uptake of cell surface receptors after binding to extracellular ligands , which is also the reason it was formerly called receptor - mediated endocytosis . In brief , a host of adaptor proteins can recruit activated receptors and initiate the formation of clathrin - coated pits ( CCP ) ( Sorkin 2004 , Schmid et al . 2006 ) . Specific adaptor proteins are required for the recruitment of specific endocytic cargos within this process ( Motley et al . 2003 ) . Clathrin itself has the structure of a triskelion and forms a lattice around the endocytic pit inducing membrane curvature ( Roth & Porter 1964 , Schmid & McMahon 2007 , McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) . While the clathrin - coat is sufficient to induce membrane curvature , scaffolding proteins of the epsin and / or BAR families are required to stabilise the curvature in order to form vesicles ( Ford et al . 2002 , Peter et al . 2004 ) . For the budding of a vesicle from a CCP , activity of the small GTPase dynamin is required , which leads to the scission of the vesicle at its neck connecting it to the plasma membrane ( De Camilli et al . 1995 , Praefcke & McMahon 2004 ) . GTPases of the Rho Introduction 38 family have been shown to inhibit CME when constitutively active ( Lamaze et al . 1996 ) , however it is questionable how physiologically relevant this regulation is , as it is not in the focus of the extensive recent literature on clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Ridley 2006 , Schmid & McMahon 2007 , Doherty & McMahon 2009 , McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) . 1 . 3 . 1 . 2 Caveolae ‐ mediated endocytosis Another pathway important for the internalisation of cell surface receptors is caveolae - mediated endocytosis . Caveolae are specialised membrane compartments rich in lipids and the eponymous protein caveolin that is capable of forming invaginations in the cell membrane ( Parton & Simons 2007 ) . From these invaginations , endocytic cargo - containing vesicles can be cleaved off . This process requires dynamin activity ( Henley et al . 1998 ) . Endocytic vesicles deriving from caveolae are more stable than clathrin - coated vesicles and first reside in compartments termed caveosomes after internalisation ( Tagawa et al . 2005 ) . Nonetheless , subsequently they are trafficked through typical endosomal compartments , such as the early endosome , as is the case for several other endocytic pathways ( Pelkmans et al . 2004 ) . Their stable nature led to the hypothesis that caveolae function as signalling platforms ( Krajewska & Maslowska 2004 ) . Furthermore , recruitment of receptors to caveolae can prohibit their internalisation through other pathways , as in the case of EGFR ( Park et al . 2000 ) . A process closely related to caveolae - mediated endocytosis is flotillin - dependent endocytosis , however endocytic cargo and flotillin are localised to distinct membrane compartments outside of caveolae ( Glebov et al . 2006 , Frick et al . 2007 ) . 1 . 3 . 1 . 3 Other clathrin ‐ independent pathways There is a host of further so - called clathrin - independent endocytic pathways and the molecular distinction between them is not always clear and varies between studies and authors ( Sandvig et al . 2008 , Doherty & McMahon 2009 , Donaldson et al . 2009 ) . One of these is the clathrin - independent carrier / GPI - anchored protein - enriched early endocytic compartment ( CLIC / GEEC ) pathway . Endocytosis through the CLIC / GEEC pathway mediates uptake of GPI - anchored proteins and extracellular fluids and is tightly regulated by Cdc42 and two GAPs : GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase - 1 Introduction 39 ( GRAF1 ) and ARHGAP10 ( Sabharanjak et al . 2002 , Kumari & Mayor 2008 , Lundmark et al . 2008 , Doherty & Lundmark 2009 ) . Internalisation through the CLIC / GEEC pathway can lead to either recycling back to the membrane or lysosomal degradation ( Fivaz et al . 2002 , Sabharanjak et al . 2002 ) . A separate clathrin - and caveolae - independent pathway requires the activity of Rac1 and its downstream effector PAK for the internalisation of interleukin receptors or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , respectively ( Grassart et al . 2008 , Kumari et al . 2008 ) . As there is conflicting evidence about whether dynamin is required for the internalisation of endocytic cargo , it is not clear whether these two reports refer to an identical pathway or whether Rac and PAK , through their effects on the actin cytoskeleton , are involved in different endocytic routes . This notion is supported by their requirement for macropinocytosis ( see below ) . Another clathrin - independent pathway is characterised by the requirement of the small GTPase Arf6 and its independence from dynamin activity ( Naslavsky et al . 2004 , D ' Souza - Schorey & Chavrier 2006 ) . Internalisation via this Arf6 - dependent endocytic pathway is tightly linked to trafficking of endocytic cargos through recycling compartments and back to the plasma membrane ( Donaldson et al . 2009 ) . Strikingly , despite being required for a clathrin - independent internalisation pathway , Arf6 has also been shown to have a regulatory role in CME by binding to clathrin and recruiting adaptor proteins ( Paleotti et al . 2005 , Tanabe et al . 2005 ) . 1 . 3 . 1 . 4 Macropinocytosis and Phagocytosis Macropinocytosis is a pathway by which larger patches of membrane are taken up . It involves the formation of membrane ruffles , which share a similarity in their composition to lipid rafts ( Manes et al . 2003 ) . Through this process , large numbers of RTKs can be internalised at the same time ( Orth et al . 2006 , Orth & McNiven 2006 ) . There are several proteins implicated in this process . The pinching off of macropinosomes from the cell membrane has been reported to not be regulated by dynamin , as in many other endocytic processes , but rather employs the activity of ATPase Pincher / EHD4 or brefeldinA - ADP ribosylated substrate ( BARS ) ( Shao et al . 2002 , Liberali et al . 2008 ) . Rac1 is critical for the formation of dorsal membrane ruffles and thus for macropinocytosis ( Ridley et al . 1992 , West et al . 2000 ) . Recruitment of Rac to sites of macropinosome formation requires cholesterol and potentially the activity of the small GTPase Arf6 ( Grimmer et al . 2002 , Introduction 40 Cotton et al . 2007 ) . Several protein kinases are involved in macropinocytosis , but the complete regulatory network has not yet been deciphered . The downstream effector of Rac1 , PAK , plays a central role in the regulation of macropinocytosis ( Dharmawardhane et al . 2000 ) . One of its important functions is the phosphorylation of BARS , which is required for BARS - mediated membrane fission to occur ( Liberali et al . 2008 ) . Furthermore , constitutive phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) activity is sufficient to induce membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis ( Amyere et al . 2000 ) . The same is true for SFK v - Src ( Veithen et al . 1996 ) . However , the precise contribution of these kinases to the macropinocytosis pathway is not clear yet . Phagocytosis is the uptake of large particles , particularly pathogens and cell debris , by specialised cells in the immune system ( Flannagan et al . 2012 ) . This ‘eating’ of large particles ( from Greek “phagein” = to devour ) requires large scale remodelling of the cytoskeleton architecture and the function of Rho family GTPases ( Massol et al . 1998 , Chimini & Chavrier 2000 , Hoppe & Swanson 2004 ) . Activation of Rac1 , Rac2 and Cdc42 in a precisely orchestrated location and temporal sequence is required for the formation of the phagocytic cup and for subsequent internalisation to ensue ( Hoppe & Swanson 2004 ) . A special form of phagocytosis is the uptake of entire living cells into another cell , called entosis , which requires RhoA activity and is thought to occur in many forms of cancer ( Overholtzer et al . 2007 ) . 1 . 3 . 1 . 5 Trans ‐ endocytosis of transmembrane molecules In rare cases , uptake of receptor - ligand complexes , in which both proteins are membrane - bound , is observed . The transmembrane ligand bride of sevenless in Drosophila melanogaster is internalised into cells expressing the sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase ( Cagan et al . 1992 ) . Sonic hedgehog is internalised into cells expressing its receptor in a dynamin - dependent process , as revealed by experiments in an avian system ( Incardona et al . 2000 ) . Another transmembrane protein internalised in a dynamin - dependent process is notch , however , this requires catalytic cleavage of its ectodomain ( Parks et al . 2000 ) . A final example of endocytosis of transmembrane proteins into another cell are the Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands ( Marston et al . 2003 , Zimmer et al . 2003 ) . This will be discussed in greater depth in the following chapter . Introduction 41 In how far the different endocytic pathways described above are completely separate and functionally distinct is not completely understood . Given the overlapping molecular mechanisms of the different pathways it is possible that there is cross - talk and cross - regulation between different endocytic routes . An interesting question is to what extent cargos such as specific receptors are associated with a specific endocytic pathway . Extensive work on EGFR has provided some insight into how the same protein can be taken up by multiple pathways and which effects this has on its signalling and function . Depending on the concentration of ligand used to stimulate EGFP - expressing cells , EGFRs are internalised by a clathrin - dependent ( at low doses of EGF ) or independent ( at high doses ) pathway ( Sigismund et al . 2005 , Orth et al . 2006 ) . Interestingly , the various endocytic pathways also lead to distinct fates of the internalised EGFR . When endocytosed through CME , EGFR can be recycled back to the plasma membrane or continue signalling from endosomal compartments , while endocytosis through clathrin - independent mechanisms leads to ubiquitination of the receptor and subsequent degradation ( Sigismund et al . 2008 ) . The variety and complexity of different endocytic pathways underscores the biological importance for cells to be able to internalise external or membrane - bound substances . As more and more characteristics of individual pathways are deciphered , attributing an endocytic pathway of a protein of interest to one of the established pathways can potentially reveal additional information about its signalling characteristics . However , given that not all boundaries between different pathways are clearly defined and the molecular mechanisms , at least to some extent , overlap , there might be more of a spectrum of interlinked endocytic mechanisms than clearly defined pathways . 1 . 3 . 2 Role of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis Since all endocytic processes require morphological changes of the cell membrane such as the formation of invaginations or protrusion around endocytic sites , it is not surprising that rearrangement of the cytoskeleton has emerged as a central element in the control of several endocytic pathways ( Girao et al . 2008 ) . Actin polymerisation drives the membrane extensions required for the engulfment of cargos and also provides an anchor for the force required to allow vesicle budding by membrane scission . The processes required for the Introduction 42 uptake of larger cargo or large patches of membrane , such as in macropinocytosis ( Merrifield et al . 1999 , Grimmer et al . 2002 ) and phagocytosis ( Swanson et al . 1999 , Chimini & Chavrier 2000 ) , especially rely heavily on actin rearrangement . To which extent the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in CME is still a matter of debate . While there is evidence that CME is not dependent on changes in the actin cytoskeleton ( Lamaze et al . 1996 , Fujimoto et al . 2000 ) , other reports show more efficient uptake of CCPs at sites of local actin reassembly at least in some physiological contexts ( Gottlieb et al . 1993 , Merrifield et al . 2002 ) . A very recent report using super - resolution live microscopy shed more light on the role of actin in CME . In their system , some CCPs co - localised with polymerised actin while others did not . Internalisation occurred in the absence of co - localisation , but the rate of uptake was higher when CCPs co - localised with polymerised actin ( Li et al . 2015 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is thus a pivotal element in the control of many endocytic processes and likely a key mediator of endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes ( see below ) . 1 . 3 . 3 Endocytosis of Eph ‐ ephrin complexes Endocytosis plays an important role in Eph - ephrin signalling . In order to switch from an initially adhesive response to a repulsive one , the interlocked Eph - ephrin complexes linking opposing cells must be removed from the cell surface . One mechanism to achieve this is by cleavage of either the Eph receptor or the ephrin thus allowing cell detachment , as described in section 1 . 1 . 2 . 3 and first shown in the reports by Hattori and colleagues and Janes and colleagues ( Hattori et al . 2000 , Janes et al . 2005 ) . The other option for removing Eph - ephrin complexes to allow cell detachment is endocytosis . In 2003 both Zimmer and colleagues and Marston and colleagues established that in parallel with cell detachment , the entire EphB - ephrinB complex was endocytosed into either the receptor or ligand expressing cell , thus mirroring bidirectional signalling capability ( Marston et al . 2003 , Zimmer et al . 2003 ) . In fact , in addition to proving the uptake of full - length proteins into the opposing cell by antibody staining against their intracellular domains , experiments with membrane stains revealed that the endocytosed vesicles also contain portions of the membrane of the opposing cell ( Marston et al . 2003 ) . Therefore , the process has been termed trans - endocytosis . Both studies show that the intracellular domains and , in the case of EphBs , their kinase function is required for Introduction 43 endocytosis to occur . Intracellular truncation of either the receptor or the ligand disrupts bidirectionality and shifts the direction of endocytosis into the opposite cell . If both elements are truncated , endocytosis and cell detachment are inhibited , and the cells adhere strongly to each other ( Zimmer et al . 2003 ) . In the unperturbed system with full - length receptors and ligands , the direction into which more endocytosis occurs depends on the cellular context and also on the sequence in which the two different cell types have been seeded , suggesting that the state of attachment plays a role . Interestingly , Marston and colleagues also showed that Ephs stay phosphorylated after endocytosis , which could allow for Eph receptor signalling from endosomal compartments . The two studies also provide some insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the trans - endocytosis process , at least in the forward direction . As expected for a process involving reorganisation of cellular membranes to the extent needed for internalising whole Eph - ephrin clusters , including patches of membrane from the opposing cell , actin dynamics are essential for trans - endocytosis to occur , as revealed by treatment with the actin - depolymerising drug cytochalasin D . The importance of actin reorganisation was further underlined by the findings that both activity of the actin - binding Arp 2 / 3 complex , as well as activity of Rac1 is required for ephrinB trans - endocytosis into EphB + cells . Interestingly , no co - localisation of internalised EphB with clathrin - coated pits or caveolin was observed , suggesting that ephrinB trans - endocytosis into EphB + cells does not use the CME or caveolae - dependent internalisation pathways ( Marston et al . 2003 ) . Finally , the internalisation of Eph - ephrin clusters is also dependent on the GTPase dynamin , which most likely regulates vesicle scission from the membrane . Zimmer and colleagues also showed the physiological relevance of trans - endocytosis for axon guidance decisions . Not only does trans - endocytosis occur between EphB - expressing cells and neurons endogenously expressing ephrinBs in culture , but it is also required for contact - mediated growth cone collapse . Furthermore , when cells expressing truncated Ephs , which restrict endocytosis to the reverse direction , were compared to cells expressing the full - length protein , allowing bidirectional endocytosis , the latter were found to induce growth cone collapse more effectively . Later work by Lauterbach and Klein indicated that EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells is important in astrocyte - neuron communication ( Lauterbach & Klein 2006 ) . Taken together , these papers highlight the importance of the trans - endocytosis Introduction 44 process for EphB - ephrinB signalling , in particular , its relevance for transforming initial adhesion into repulsion . Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing this process will enable a better understanding of the function of Eph - ephrin signalling in many relevant physiological contexts , such as axon guidance and tissue border formation . After the initial work presented in these papers , several other studies further elucidated the molecular mechanisms of Eph - ephrin endocytosis . However , these studies did not examine endocytosis in a cell - cell contact - mediated setting , but rather made use of the fact that signalling responses can also be elicited by treating cells with pre - clustered soluble receptor or ligand ectodomains . In how far the uptake of clusters induced by soluble ectodomains uses the same molecular mechanisms is not clear , especially in light of recent work that has shown significant differences in phosphorylation patterns downstream of cell - contact induced Eph - ephrin signalling when compared to that induced by soluble ectodomains ( Jorgensen et al . 2009 ) . Still , at least some of the requisite proteins described by the Marston and Zimmer studies have also been implicated in regulating endocytosis of soluble ephrin ectodomains into Eph + cells . For example , Rac1 was shown to be involved in uptake of EphA and EphB receptors after stimulation with soluble ephrin ectodomains ( Cowan et al . 2005 , Tolias et al . 2007 , Yoo et al . 2010 , Um et al . 2014 ) . Moreover , Cowan and colleagues discovered that growth cone collapse downstream of EphA receptors in retinal ganglion cells is dependent on the Rac - GEF Vav . Vav - induced Rac activity leads to endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , which is required for growth cone collapse . Without Vav - mediated growth cone collapse , retinogeniculate projection neurons show aberrant guidance and wiring . While endocytosis of ephrinA1—EphA4 receptor clusters is inhibited in neurons cultured from Vav2 / 3 knockout mice , uptake of transferrin , a protein endocytosed via CME , is not altered , suggesting uptake of ephrinA1 - EphA4 clusters is independent of CME ( Cowan et al . 2005 ) . The Rac subfamily - specific GEF Tiam1 has been implicated as a regulator of endocytosis of both EphAs and EphBs after stimulation with soluble ephrin ectodomains . Initial work by Tolias and colleagues revealed an interaction between Tiam1 and EphB receptors in dendritic spine development . Upon stimulation with ephrinB1 Tiam1 is recruited to EphB2 clusters , where it is phosphorylated ( Tolias et al . 2007 ) . Phosphorylation of Tiam1 then increases its GEF activity towards Rac ( Servitja et al . 2003 , Miyamoto et al . 2006 ) . Tiam1 Introduction 45 can also interact with EphAs via their JM region ( Yoo et al . 2010 , Boissier et al . 2013 ) . This interaction is important for the ephrinA5 - induced internalisation of EphA8 clusters ( Yoo et al . 2010 ) . Co - localisation with clathrin heavy chain molecules and transferrin suggests that EphA8 is internalised via the clathrin - mediated pathway after stimulation with soluble ephrinA5 - FC . Subsequent work by the same group provides evidence that a mutated EphA8 receptor lacking the Tiam1 interaction domain in the JM region is able to negatively affect endocytosis of other EphA receptors and expression of this internalisation - deficient mutant leads to aberrant retinocollicular topographic mapping ( Yoo et al . 2011 ) . Tiam1 is also involved in the internalisation of EphB receptors upon stimulation with ephrin ectodomains ( Um et al . 2014 ) . For the role of EphB receptors in spine development and synapse maturation , a fine - tuned balance in Rac activity needs to be achieved , since on one hand , Rac activity is required for spine growth and synapse development , while on the other hand , excessive Rac activity leads to excessive endocytosis and spine loss . This balance is achieved by a regulatory complex formed between Tiam1 and Bcr , which has GAP activity towards Rac . This regulatory complex can bind to EphB2 and in the inactive state of the receptor , the inhibitory function of Bcr on Rac activity is dominant . Upon stimulation with ephrinB1 , however , a disruption of the Tiam1 - Bcr complex and a transient increase of Tiam1 phosphorylation and Rac activity was observed . These events are required for ephrinB1 - induced spine and synapse formation . Interestingly , experiments using neuronal cultures from Bcr knockout mice , or with neurons expressing dominant negative isoforms of Bcr , indicate that despite being a negative regulator of Rac activity , Bcr function is still required for ephrinB1 - induced spine growth , as stimulation with ephrinB1 ectodomains in these genetic backgrounds led to a loss of spines and synapses . One explanation for these striking results is the effect Bcr exerts on the endocytosis of EphB2s . In Bcr knockout mice the level of internalisation of EphB2s after ephrinB1 stimulation is greatly elevated , which potentially attenuates the signalling required for spine growth and synapse development mediated by EphB2 - activated Tiam1 and Rac . In addition to the requirement of Rac , Tiam1 and the regulating function of BCR , work by Um and colleagues also implies that activity of the GTPase dynamin and the CME pathway Introduction 46 are required for endocytosis of EphB2 receptors upon stimulation with ephrinB ectodomains . Interestingly , additional research into the role of Tiam1 in Eph - ephrin signalling and endocytosis suggests continuous signalling of EphA - ephrinA complexes from endosomal compartments ( Boissier et al . 2013 ) . This study confirmed the earlier observation that Ephs remain phosphorylated after internalisation and also revealed that Tiam1 remains bound to Ephs in endosomes . However , the study does not provide direct evidence of EphA signalling from the endosome , so whether the retained phosphorylation and interaction of Eph with Tiam1 at the endosome has physiological relevance still remains to be clarified . Furthermore , Boissier and colleagues also shed some light on the intracellular trafficking of internalised EphAs , which can undergo either lysosomal degradation ( about 2 / 3 of internalised clusters ) or they can be recycled to the plasma membrane ( 1 / 3 ) . Further evidence for degradation through the lysosome of internalised Eph receptors comes from studies linking EphA2 and EphB1 to the ubiquitin ligase Cbl and subsequent degradation ( Walker - Daniels et al . 2002 , Sharfe et al . 2003 , Fasen et al . 2008 ) . After stimulation with ephrinA1 or ephinB1 respectively , Ephs phosphorylate Cbl , which in turns ubiquitinates the receptors and primes them for degradation . A recent study provides further evidence for this by showing that ubiquitination of EphA2s shifts their trafficking away from processing through the recycling endosome to degradation in the lysosome ( Sabet et al . 2015 ) . While signalling from Rac family GEFs positively regulates Eph receptor endocytosis , negative regulators have also been identified . SH2 domain containing inositol 5 - phosphatase 2 ( SHIP2 ) interacts with EphA2 via its SAM domain and negatively regulates the activity of PI3K , which in turn is an activator of Rac activity ( Zhuang et al . 2007 ) . Overexpression of SHIP2 leads to a reduction of ephrinA1 - induced EphA2 endocytosis , while knockdown of SHIP2 by siRNA results in an increase of Rac activity and consequently , an increase of endocytosis . Endocytosis of EphAs is not regulated only by small GTPases of the Rho family , but also by GTPases of the Rab family . Internalisation of EphA4 in cultured cells and amygdala neurons stimulated by pre - clustered ephrinB3 ectodomains requires the Rab5GEF activity Introduction 47 of Rin1 and internalised clusters traffic through Rab5 - positive compartments ( Deininger et al . 2008 ) . Both EphAs and EphBs interact with caveolin and localise to caveolae upon activation by their ligands , however it is unclear whether this results in internalisation through the caveolae - dependent endocytic route and whether this is a cell type - specific observation or a general feature of Eph - ephrin signalling ( Vihanto et al . 2006 ) This finding is also in contrast to the report from Marston an colleagues that could not detect a co - localisation of cell contact - induced EphB clusters with caveolae ( Marston et al . 2003 ) . Only a small number of studies have investigated the mechanisms of endocytosis into ephrin - expressing cells . One study suggests that ephrinBs can be internalised via clathrin - mediated endocytosis , since potassium depletion ( a method used for studying CME ( Larkin et al . 1983 ) ) and abrogation of dynamin function inhibited uptake of ephrinB1 into the cell upon stimulation with EphB1 ectodomains ( Parker et al . 2004 ) . Work by Mann and colleagues shows that endocytosis of soluble EphB2 ectodomains into ephrinB expressing cells occurs in the context of growth cone collapse , but the endocytic machinery required is not described ( Mann et al . 2003 ) . As ephrinB1 has been shown to interact with Tiam1 and induce an increase in Rac activity , it is possible that endocytosis into ephrinB + cells is also mediated via Tiam1 and Rac , though so far no direct evidence for this has been reported ( Tanaka et al . 2004 ) . In conclusion , the molecular mechanisms underlying Eph - ephrin endocytosis are not yet completely understood . For forward endocytosis into Eph - expressing cells the endocytic machineries seem to overlap between ephrin trans - endocytosis and stimulation with soluble ephrin ectodomains , as well as between EphA + and EphB + cells , as all of these processes require Rac activity . However , in how far trans - endocytosis and endocytosis upon stimulation with soluble ephrin are completely comparable remains questionable as is indicated by the conflicting evidence on the involvement of the CME pathway . Nonetheless , it is conceivable that the GEFs and GAPs regulating endocytosis of Ephs stimulated with soluble ephrin ectodomains are also involved in the regulation of trans - endocytosis , since they can influence Rac activity . Even less is known about the mechanism of reverse endocytosis into ephrin + cells . So far only very few studies Introduction 48 addressed the topic of its molecular mechanisms and if so , not in a systematic fashion . Furthermore , whether ephrinA - expressing cells experience reverse endocytosis at all is not known to date . Figure 3 summarises the current knowledge of Eph - ephrin endocytosis . Figure 3 .

Rac activity and actin reorganisation postulated according to reports for the forward direction . 1 . 3 . 4 Endocytosis regulated by Eph ‐ ephrin signalling While endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes plays a central role in Eph - ephrin signalling , the Eph - ephrin system in turn can regulate the endocytosis of other molecules . In axon guidance , collapse and steering of growth cones are pivotal events that both require gross changes in membrane surface area , which can be mediated by endocytosis ( Tojima et al . 2011 ) . This process can be regulated by Eph - ephrin signalling . In chick retinal axons , stimulation with ephrinA2 induces endocytosis required for growth cone collapse by activating Rac1 ( Jurney et al . 2002 ) . At synapses , Eph - ephrin signalling can regulate endocytosis of AMPA receptors and thus influence synaptic maturation and plasticity ( Irie et al . 2005 , Essmann et al . 2008 ) . Remarkably , forward and reverse signalling seem to have opposing effects on the internalisation of AMPA receptors . Irie and colleagues report that EphB2s can associate with the phosphatase synaptojanin and phosphorylate it . Phosphorylation inhibits the phosphatase function of synaptojanin and leads to elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) . This in turn leads to an increase in CME and , particularly , to an increase in the internalisation of AMPA receptors . In contrast to this , postsynaptic ephrinB reverse signalling leads to a stabilisation of AMPA receptors at the cell membrane ( Essmann et al . 2008 ) . In neurons from ephrinB2 knockout mice , increased AMPA internalisation results in reduced synaptic transmission and synapse loss . Mechanistically the stabilising function of ephrinBs requires phosphorylation of a serine residue and an interaction with scaffolding proteins like GRIP1 . In the vascular system , ephrinB2 reverse signalling can regulate internalisation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors ( VEGFRs ) and PDGFRs ( Sawamiphak et al . 2010 , Nakayama et al . 2013 ) . Guidance of tip cells is as essential for vascular sprouting and development as axon guidance is for neuronal development . VEGFRs help orient tip cells by detecting VEGF gradients . VEGFR - mediated guidance requires the internalisation of the receptor in order to be effective . EphrinB2 reverse signalling , which requires the PDZ Introduction 50 domain of ephrinB2 , is necessary for the internalisation of VEGFR2 ( Sawamiphak et al . 2010 ) , whereas , in vascular smooth muscle cells , ephrinB2 reverse signalling controls PDGFRbeta internalisation in the opposite fashion ( Nakayama et al . 2013 ) . Cells cultured from ephrinB2 mutant mice display increased endocytosis of PDGFRbeta , since the receptor gets redistributed from caveolae to clathrin - coated membrane components . Simultaneously , signalling downstream of PDGFRbeta through MAP kinase and JNK is increased , while signalling through Tiam1 and Rac is reduced , which results in decreased proliferation . Unfortunately , the study does not comment on any link between Tiam1 / Rac signalling and endocytosis . These studies show that regulation of endocytic processes by Eph - ephrin signalling is an important facet of Eph - ephrin function . The studying of the role of Eph - ephrin controlled endocytosis is thus complicated by the fact that the same or overlapping signalling molecules and mechanisms are involved in downstream signalling of Eph - ephrin complexes , the regulation of Eph - ephrin endocytosis itself , or the endocytosis of other proteins regulated by Eph - ephrin signalling . This makes it difficult to distinguish between direct effects on Eph - ephrin endocytosis and indirect effects by interfering with common endocytic pathways for any studied molecule . Introduction 51 1 . 4 Aims of the study The Eph - ephrin signalling system is essential for a plethora of physiological functions , especially during development , as well as playing an important role in several diseases , including cancer . Understanding the precise molecular regulation of the Eph - ephrin system is therefore of great interest . An important element of signalling from Eph - ephrin complexes , especially with regards to a switch from mediating an adhesive to a repulsive signal , is the removal of Eph - ephrin complexes from the cell membrane . In addition to cleavage of ephrins ( Hattori et al . 2000 ) or Ephs ( Gatto et al . 2014 ) , the key mechanism for removing Eph - ephrin complexes form the cell surface is internalisation by trans - endocytosis ( Marston et al . 2003 , Zimmer et al . 2003 ) . Internalisation can occur both into the receptor - expressing cell ( forward direction ) or the ligand - expressing cell ( reverse direction ) . Despite years of study of the underlying molecular mechanisms of this process , it is still far from being completely understood ( see Fig 3 ) . Thus far , research has mainly focussed on forward direction signalling , while little is known about the regulation of the reverse direction . One candidate group of proteins are the Rho family of small GTPases and their regulating GEFs and GAPs , as their requirement in various endocytic pathways has not only been well established ( Qualmann & Mellor 2003 , Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) , but they have also already been implicated in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells ( Marston et al . 2003 ) . Another potentially limiting factor of many studies conducted to date is their use of stimulation with soluble recombinant ligand or receptor ectodomains , whereas in the physiological situation , both elements are membrane - tethered and the trans - endocytosis process involves entire complexes of full - length proteins , including patches of membrane from the opposing cell . It is very conceivable that the internalisation of pre - clustered soluble ectodomains makes use of a distinct endocytic machinery compared to the trans - endocytosis occurring in a cell - cell contact - mediated situation . Introduction 52 This study therefore comprises four central aims : 1 . Deciphering the contribution of different Rho - family GTPases in the regulation of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells by systematic experimental analysis . 2 . Identifying key upstream regulators of EphB trans - endocytosis among the Rho - family GEFs and GAPs using an image - based siRNA screen . 3 . Comparing the molecular mechanisms required for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells to those implicated in ephrinB trans - endocytosis into EphB + cells , and verifying the physiological significance of our findings in primary neuronal cultures . 4 . Clarifying the physiological relevance of using soluble recombinant ectodomains to study Eph - ephrin endocytosis by analysing whether internalisation of soluble ectodomain - induced Eph - ephrin complexes differs in the endocytic machinery used from the trans - endocytosis of membrane - tethered complexes . Understanding these key points of the molecular mechanisms of Eph - ephrin endocytosis will be important in unravelling how the Eph - ephrin system shapes intercellular interactions and communication in developmental and disease contexts . Results 53 2 Results 2 . 1 Establishing tools for the investigation of EphB trans ‐ endocytosis into ephrinB + cells 2 . 1 . 1 HeLa and SKN cells express a wide variety of Rho ‐ family GTPases The general mechanisms of Eph - ephrin endocytosis can be studied in cultured cells originally derived from human cell lines . These cells are easily accessible using light microscopy and a considerable toolbox of genetic techniques , such as over - expression of selected proteins or knockdown of protein expression by siRNA transfection , can be easily utilised . As SKN neuroblastoma cells endogenously express ephrinB1 and ephrinB2 ( T . Gaitanos , unpublished results ) , and since we are particularly interested in the mechanisms of EphB - ephrinB reverse endocytosis , we chose to employ them as the principal cell line to perform our experiments in . For easier identification of the SKN cells , we used a subclone stably over - expressing red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) tagged to histone 2B ( H2B - RFP ) , which resulted in a fluorescently labelled nucleus . We additionally conducted experiments in HeLa cells , a human cell line derived from cervical cancer cells , to confirm that results obtained from SKN cells were not cell line - specific , but represented general mechanisms in Eph - ephrin endocytosis . Both HeLa and SKN cells are derived from cancer cells , which are known to express a variety of Rho - family GTPases ( Sahai & Marshall 2002a ) , and there is the potential of physiological redundancy , if several members of the same subfamily are co - expressed . Therefore we used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) to identify which GTPases are expressed . We focused on the RhoA , Rac and Cdc42 subfamilies , given their well - established role in endocytic processes and the atypical characteristics of the other Rho family GTPases ( see Introduction section 1 . 2 . 1 ) . Figure 4 depicts results from the RT - PCR with an image from the gel loaded with the RT - PCR products ( Fig . 4A ) . As both the primers for RhoJ and RhoC resulted in PCR products of the wrong size , we repeated the RT - PCR for these genes with different primer sets ( Fig . 4B ) . The table in Figure 4C shows that many of the tested GTPases are expressed in both SKN and HeLa cells . SKN cells express RhoA and RhoB , the Rac subfamily members Rac1 , Rac3 and RhoG , and the Cdc42 subfamily members Cdc42 , RhoQ and Results 54 RhoU . HeLa cells additionally express Rac2 from the Rac subfamily and RhoV from the Cdc42 subfamily . This high number of different GTPases expressed in SKN and HeLa cells could potentially pose a challenge for studying their involvement in Eph - ephrin endocytosis and the possibility of their physiological redundancy was thus addressed in our experiments .

Results 55 2 . 1 . 2 Establishing siRNA knockdown as a tool for studying the involvement of Rho ‐ family GTPases in Eph ‐ ephrin endocytosis A useful way to study the functional requirements of proteins is knockdown using siRNA . We confirmed the effectiveness of the siRNA knockdown of Rho family GTPases by Western blot analysis . Since SKN cells express several members of the respective GTPase subfamilies ( see Fig . 4 ) , we tested siRNA oligos for each of the expressed GTPases . Protein expression was detected from total cell lysates using specific antibodies against the protein being knocked down , or in the cases of over - expression , tagged proteins with anti - GFP or anti - FLAG antibodies , respectively . Tubulin or GAPDH were used as loading controls . 20 nM was chosen as the maximum working concentration for the siRNA , since it provided a good balance between knockdown efficiency and cell toxicity ( T . Gaitanos , unpublished results ) . None of the commercially available antibodies for the GTPases RhoQ and RhoU detected a specific band at the correct molecular weight . Therefore I first over - expressed tagged versions of the proteins , RhoQ - GFP or FLAG - RhoU , and then knocked down expression with siRNA . Representative blots show that knockdown of Cdc42 was dose - dependent and highly effective at 20 nM oligo concentration ( Fig . 5A ) . For RhoQ and RhoU , several oligos were tested and those resulting in the most effective knockdown ( oligo number 19 for RhoQ and number 45 for RhoU ) were used for subsequent experiments ( Fig . 5B and C ) . Knockdown of Rac subfamily members was not as efficient as for Cdc42 subfamily GTPases . Treatment with Rac1 - specific siRNA oligos or the combination of Rac1 - and Rac3 - specific oligos did not lead to a very effective knockdown of Rac1 , as revealed by the amount of protein remaining in the representative blot with anti - Rac1 antibody ( Fig . 5D , upper panel ) . Further , knockdown of Rac3 was not one hundred percent effective , as revealed by detection using an anti - Rac3 antibody ( Fig . 5D , lower panel ) . However , the remaining amount of protein detected could also be due to cross - reactivity of the anti - Rac3 antibody with Rac1 protein , as suggested by the visible decrease in antibody - binding observed in the cells treated with a Rac1 - specific oligo . Knockdown of RhoG , on the other hand , was very effective with both of the RhoG - specific oligos tested , as shown in the representative blot ( Fig . 5E ) . For the RhoA subfamily proteins , we tested the protein - specific oligos at half the maximum concentration ( 10 nM ) mixed with scramble oligos in order to resemble the condition of the double knockdown , Results 56 where the two oligos were also used at 10 nM each . The two representative blots in figure 5F clearly revealed effective knockdown of both RhoA ( upper panel ) and RhoB ( lower panel ) in the single as well as in the double knockdown conditions : Figure 5 . siRNA knockdown of Rho family GTPases ( A ) Western Blot of siRNA knockdown of Cdc42 in SKN cells .

Results 57 2 . 1 . 3 siRNA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of Rho family GTPases do not alter surface expression of ephrinBs To study the endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , it is important that the amount of available ephrin on the cell surface is unchanged between different experimental conditions in order to avoid potentially skewed results . Therefore , I tested the surface expression of ephrinBs under siRNA treatment or pharmacological inhibition of Rac family members with EHT1864 ( Shutes et al . 2007 ) by incubating SKN H2B - RFP cells with 2 µg / ml of pre - clustered EphB2 - Fc tagged with a fluorescently labelled antibody . Incubation was limited to 2 min at room temperature before transferring cells on ice to prevent endocytosis . After fixation , I stained for clusters on the cell surface in non - permeabilising conditions with a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody against Fc ( Fig . 6A ) . Images were analysed with CellProfiler TM software ( Carpenter et al . 2006 ) and the number of surface clusters per cell between the different conditions were compared ( for further details , see Materials and Methods section 4 . 2 . 12 ) . To serve as a positive control , ephrinB itself was knocked down in SKN cells , since in cells depleted of ephrinBs , no binding of EphB2 - Fc at the surface should be expected . Accordingly , surface cluster numbers were significantly reduced in cells depleted of both ephrinB1 and ephrinB2 ( 5 . 52 clusters / cell ) when compared to the scramble control ( 27 . 63 clusters / cell ) , while knockdown of ephrinB2 alone gave an intermediate response ( 12 . 68 clusters / cell ) as the cells were still expressing ephrinB1 ( Fig . 6B ) . Remaining vesicles in the ephrinB knockdown control were potentially due to a less than 100 % effectiveness of the transfected siRNA . As an additional control , cells were stimulated with hFc instead of Eph2 - Fc , which form almost no surface clusters as expected . The observed average value of 0 . 2 clusters per cell treated with hFc very likely reflected unspecific debris or artefacts from the automated analysis with CellProfiler TM software . Importantly , neither knockdown of all expressed members of the Cdc42 , Rac or RhoA subfamilies by combination of siRNA oligos ( Fig . 6B and D ) , nor inhibition of Rac with EHT1864 ( Fig . 6C and E ) affected the levels of ephrinBs expressed on the surface of SKN cells significantly . Results 58 Results 59 Figure 6 . Surface expression of ephrinBs ( A ) Schematic representation of the experimental setup . SKN H2B ‐ RFP cells treated with siRNA or Rac inhibitor EHT1864 were stimulated with EphB2 ‐ Fc pre ‐ clustered with a Cy2 ‐ conjugated antibody ( green dots ) on ice for 5 min . Cells were subsequently fixed and stained with a dyLight649 ‐ conjugated antibody against Fc to visualise surface clusters ( red dots ) .

Scale bar represents 20 µm . 2 . 1 . 4 siRNA knockdown of Rho family GTPases does not inhibit motility of SKN cells One of our primary goals was to understand the trans - endocytosis mechanism of Eph - ephrin complexes in the context of cell - cell contact and repulsion . To adequately study this physiological process , we relied on experiments using co - culture systems , in which cells expressing ephrinBs or EphB receptors come into contact with each other . Given the well - established effects of Rho family GTPases on the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility ( Parri & Chiarugi 2010 ) , I tested whether siRNA knockdown of entire subfamilies of Rho GTPases interfered with cell motility and the ability of SKN cells to contact other cells . Live - cell imaging for extended periods of time ( up to 6 h ) revealed that SKN cells treated with siRNA against Rho family GTPases remain mobile and retain their ability to come into contact with other cells , while confirming the expected changes in cell morphology ( Fig . 7 ) . Experiments also demonstrated that over a period of 60 minutes , cells were able to form new contacts with other cells and detach from each other . We therefore chose 80 min as the duration for our co - culture trans - endocytosis experiments , as it allowed cells sufficient time to settle , come into contact with neighbouring cells , and engage in Eph - ephrin signalling and trans - endocytosis . Results 60 Figure 7 . Live ‐ cell imaging of motility of siRNA ‐ treated SKN cells Cells were seeded into 8 ‐ well live ‐ cell imaging chambers and treated with siRNA as labelled . Live ‐ cell imaging was performed over 6 h at 5 min intervals . 4 frames taken 20 min apart are shown for each treatment . Red dashed outline highlights cells of interest .

Scale bar represents 20 µm . 2 . 2 Deciphering the role of Rho family GTPases in Eph ‐ Ephrin endocytosis 2 . 2 . 1 Rac subfamily GTPases are required for EphB trans ‐ endocytosis into ephrinB + cells The trans - endocytosis process of Eph - ephrin complexes containing both full - length ligands and receptors was originally described in two studies published 10 years ago ( Marston et al . 2003 , Zimmer et al . 2003 ) . The work of Marston and colleagues already showed that trans - endocytosis in the forward direction is blocked in cells expressing a dominant negative version of Rac . For the reverse direction , however , the molecular mechanisms are Results 61 unknown . We therefore tested whether Rac subfamily GTPases are also required for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . To this end , we performed co - culture experiments with ephrinB + SKN H2B - RFP ( acceptor cells ) cells previously treated with siRNA against Rac proteins and HeLa cells expressing a FLAG - EphB2  C - GFP construct ( donor cells ) . Since the C - terminally truncated form of the EphB2 receptor expressed in the donor cells is defective for endocytosis in the forward direction ( Zimmer et al . 2003 ) , trans - endocytosis will only occur in the reverse direction in this experimental setup , i . e . from the HeLa cell into SKN cells . The FLAG epitope on the extracellular domain of the EphB2 receptor enables staining of Eph - ephrin complexes located on the cell surface . The difference between the total number of Eph - ephrin clusters in SKN cells and the number of clusters located on the cell surface represents the number of internalised clusters ( Fig . 8A ) . To dissect the potential individual contributions of the different Rac subfamily GTPases and account for possible redundancies between them , we used oligos against Rac1 , Rac3 and RhoG separately , as well as all possible combinations of any two Rac subfamily GTPases and a knockdown of all three of them . As a negative control , cells were treated with scramble oligos and as a positive control , siRNA against ephrinB2 or against both ephrinB2 and ephrinB1 was used to prevent cluster formation and thus internalisation . After siRNA treatment for 72 h , SKN cells were co - cultured with HeLa cells expressing FLAG - EphB2  C - GFP for 80 min in order for cell contact , cluster formation and trans - endocytosis to occur . Cells were then fixed and stained against the FLAG epitope to visualise surface clusters . For each experiment , each condition was tested in triplicate in 96 - well plates and for each well , 10 images were taken ( Fig . 8D ) . Image analysis was performed semi - automatically using CellProfiler TM and is described in detail in section 4 . 2 . 12 and Fig . 23 . . Knockdown of ephrinBs reduced trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes as expected and thus validated the experimental approach . In contrast knockdown of single Rac subfamily members or a combination of knockdowns of any two Rac subfamily members did not result in significant changes in the number of internalised Eph - ephrin clusters when compared to the negative control ( Fig . 8B ) . However , when Rac1 , Rac3 and RhoG were targeted by siRNA oligos simultaneously , the number of internalised clusters was Results 62 significantly decreased in comparison to treatment with scramble oligos . The observed decrease in trans - endocytosis was only partial , though ( reduced to 75 % of control levels , Fig . 8B ) , which could potentially be explained by ineffectiveness of the siRNA oligos used ( compare Fig . 5D ) . These results indicate that Rac subfamily GTPases are required for the efficient trans - endocytosis of EphB into ephrinB + SKN cells , and that Rac1 , Rac3 and RhoG are physiologically redundant in this context .

SKN H2B ‐ RFP cells were treated with siRNA ( either as scramble sequence , or pools of oligos targeting ephrinBs 1 and 2 , or Racs 1 , 3 and RhoG ; top , middle and bottom rows , respectively ) for 72 h prior to 80 min co ‐ culture with HeLa cells expressing FLAG ‐ EphB2  C ‐ GFP . Cells were then fixed on ice and probed against the FLAG tag without permeabilisation ( surface EphB2  C , shown in red ) . Internalised clusters were determined as total EphB2  C ( green ) puncta distinct from surface EphB2  C ( appears as yellow ) within the vicinity of the SKN nuclei ( RFP channel , shown in blue ) .

Scale bars represent 20 µm . All experiments in this figure performed by T . Gaitanos . Results 63 In order to corroborate these findings , we pharmacologically inhibited Rac activity by treatment with the specific Rac inhibitor EHT1864 in the same experimental setup . Instead of transfection with siRNA oligos , SKN cells were treated with vehicle control or EHT1864 at a concentration of either 10 µM ( images not shown ) or 20 µM for 4 h before Results 64 co - culturing with HeLa cells ( Fig . 8E ) . Confirming results from our siRNA experiments , treatment with EHT1864 led to a reduction in the number of internalised Eph - ephrin clusters in comparison with the control condition in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 8C ) . The effect on trans - endocytosis was stronger than that observed in siRNA experiments ( reduced to 25 % of control levels with 20 µM EHT1864 , Fig . 8C ) , suggesting that inhibitor treatment leads to a more effective reduction of Rac activity than siRNA - mediated knock down of protein expression . We wanted to rule out that the requirement of Rac subfamily GTPases in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells is a cell type - specific effect and thus conducted experiments with HeLa cells as both donor and acceptor cells . Since HeLa cells express Rac2 in addition to the other three Rac subfamily members expressed in SKN cells , and knockdown of a fourth protein by siRNA is technically very challenging , we chose to also use EHT1864 for experiments in HeLa cells . HeLa cells expressing ephrinB1 - mCherry ( as acceptor cells ) were treated with EHT1864 as described above and co - cultured with HeLa cells expressing a FLAG - EphB2  C - GFP construct ( Fig . 9A ) . Inhibition of Rac activity with EHT1864 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of internalised EphB - ephrinB clusters compared to vehicle - treated control at concentrations of both 10 µM and 20 µM ( Fig . 9B and C ) , as determined by manual counting of images acquired and analysed blindly . These results confirm the findings in SKN cells and indicate that the requirement of Rac activity for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells represents a general mechanism .

I therefore wanted to investigate if Rac activity is also required for EphB trans - endocytosis in cultured neurons . Primary cortical neurons endogenously express ephrinBs and are thus a very good experimental model ( Tanaka et al . 2004 ) . I cultured cortical neurons derived from E15 . 5 mouse embryos overnight in live cell imaging chambers . Neurons were stained with CellTracker Green and treated with vehicle control or several concentrations of Rac inhibitor EHT1864 prior to co - culturing with HeLa ( donor ) cells transiently over - expressing an EphB2  C - mCherry construct . Live cell imaging was performed on a spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an incubation chamber to maintain an environment of 5 % CO 2 and 37 °C . Several positions where EphB2  C - mCherry expressing HeLa cells settled next to a healthy neuron were selected and imaged every three minutes for a total duration of three hours . Resulting videos were analysed manually by observing sites of contact between neuron and HeLa cell and determining , whether internalisation of EphB2  C - mCherry - containing complexes into the neurons occurred . To ensure proper detachment had occurred internalisation was determined as a vesicle detaching from HeLa cell protrusions for at least three consecutive frames . Treatment with 20 µM EHT1864 led to growth cone collapse in the majority of neurons ( data not shown ) , thus cells were treated with concentrations of 2 . 5 µM , 5 µM and 10 µM . Figure 10A shows frames taken from example movies of vehicle - treated neurons exhibiting trans - endocytosis of EphB2  C - mCherry - containing complexes ( top two panels ) , and prolonged cell adhesion without internalisation of EphB2  C - mCherry - containing complexes in neurons treated with EHT1864 ( bottom panel ) . Quantification of the average percentage of contact sites with internalisation events revealed a significant reduction of trans - endocytosis of EphB2  C - mCherry - containing complexes into neurons treated with EHT1864 at all tested concentrations ( Fig . 10B ) . I therefore conclude that Rac activity is required for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + neurons and the mechanism is potentially the same as the one employed by HeLa and SKN cells .

Having established the importance of Rac subfamily members for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , I next examined whether the same mechanisms are employed for the reverse endocytosis of soluble EphB ectodomains . I treated SKN H2B - RFP cells with siRNA oligos against Rac1 alone or with a combination of oligos against the three Rac subfamily members expressed in SKN cells - Rac1 , Rac3 and RhoG . The siRNA - treated cells were incubated with 2 µg / ml of a fusion protein of the ectodomain of EphB2 and the human Fc fragment ( EphB2 - Fc ) pre - clustered with a Cy2 - conjugated antibody at 37 °C for 30 minutes to allow endocytosis to occur . Subsequently , cells were fixed and stained against Fc without permeabilisation to visualise EphB2 - ephrinB clusters that had not been internalised ( Fig . 11A ) . Scrambled siRNA oligo , combined knockdown of ephrinB1 and ephrinB2 , and incubation with pre - clustered hFc instead of EphB2 - Fc were used as controls . As expected , only very few endocytosed clusters were observed in knockdown of ephrinBs ( Fig . 11D , second row of images , and B ) . Treatment with hFc showed that endocytosis was dependent on the presence of the EphB ectodomain and not of the Fc portion of the fusion protein ( Fig . 11B ) . When compared to the scramble control , neither treatment with Rac1 oligo alone , nor knockdown of the entire Rac subfamily , showed any significant difference in the amount of internalised EphB2 - ephrinB clusters ( Fig . 11B and D ) . Since knockdown of Rac subfamily proteins by siRNA has been shown to be only partial ( Fig . 5D ) and treatment with EHT1864 had resulted in a stronger effect on EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells ( Fig . 8B and C and Fig . 9B ) , I wanted to confirm the siRNA results by pharmacological inhibition of Rac subfamily GTPases . I treated SKN cells with either H 2 O or EHT1864 ( at 10 µM or 20 µM ) for 4 h before incubating them with pre - clustered EphB2 - Fc . There was no significant difference in the average number of internalised EphB - ephrinB clusters between vehicle treatment and treatment with EHT1864 at the tested concentrations ( Fig . 11C and E ) . These data support the results from Results 69 the siRNA knockdown experiments and argue that Rac subfamily GTPases are not required for endocytosis of soluble EphB2 ectodomains into ephrinB + SKN cells .

Scale bar equals 20 µm . Results 70 Results 71 To further support the findings that Rac subfamily GTPases are not required for reverse endocytosis of soluble EphB2 receptors , I also carried out experiments in HeLa cells transiently expressing ephrinB1 - mCherry . Furthermore , working with HeLa cells also allowed me to compare the results with forward endocytosis of soluble ephrinB2 by using cells transiently over - expressing EphB2 - mCherry . In principle , the experiments were conducted analogously to the experiments using SKN cells . HeLa cells expressing either EphB2 - mCherry or ephrinB1 - mCherry were pre - treated with vehicle control or EHT1864 at 10 µM ( images not shown ) or 20 µM concentrations for 4 h before being incubated with 2 µg / ml of ephrinB2 - Fc or EphB2 - Fc pre - clustered with a Cy2 - conjugated antibody . After an incubation period of 30 min , cells were fixed with PFA and stained with a secondary antibody against Fc without permeabilisation to visualise surface clusters ( Fig . 12A and B ) . Incubation with hFc instead of the ephrinB2 or EphB2 fusion proteins was used as an absolute control and showed only minimal internalisation or surface binding ( data not shown ) . For reverse endocytosis , treatment with either 10 µM or 20 µM EHT1864 led to no significant difference in the number of internalised Eph - ephrin clusters compared to the vehicle control ( Fig . 12C ) . In contrast , EHT1864 treatment led to a significant reduction in the amount of internalised Eph - ephrin clusters in the forward direction at concentrations of both 10 µM and 20 µM ( Fig . 12D ) . These results are in line with previous reports proposing the involvement of Rac in forward endocytosis of Eph receptor clusters induced by soluble ephrins ( Cowan et al . 2005 , Yoo et al . 2010 , Um et al . 2014 ) . The data also show that the Rac inhibitor EHT1864 successfully generates an effect under our experimental conditions and that the lack of an effect of EHT1864 on reverse endocytosis is not due to inefficient inhibition of Rac family GTPases . In conclusion , the data indicate that the mechanisms of endocytosis of soluble EphB and ephrinB ectodomains are different : uptake of ephrinB into EphB + cells requires Rac activity , whereas uptake of EphB into ephrinB does not . Furthermore , the mechanism of ephrinB - mediated uptake of EphB critically depends on membrane tethering of EphB : trans - endocytosis of full - length EphB from an opposing cell into the ephrinB + cell requires Rac activity , whereas uptake of soluble EphB ectodomain into the ephrinB + cell does not .

( n = 3 ‐ 5 independent experiments ) . 2 . 2 . 4 Cdc42 subfamily GTPases are not required for endocytosis of EphB2 into ephrinB + cells Cdc42 and the members of its subfamily have already been implicated in the context of endocytosis ( Sabharanjak et al . 2002 , Chadda et al . 2007 ) , and also as downstream effectors of Eph - ephrin signalling ( Irie & Yamaguchi 2002 , Nishimura et al . 2006 ) . They are therefore good candidates for being regulators of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . SKN cells express three members of the Cdc42 subfamily of Rho GTPases : Cdc42 , RhoQ and RhoU ( Fig . 4 ) . To test the role of Cdc42 subfamily members in EphB trans - endocytosis , I used the trans - endocytosis assay co - culturing siRNA - treated SKN cells with HeLa cells expressing an EphB2  C - GFP construct as described before . In addition to the control conditions described above , knockdown of the expressed Cdc42 subfamily members individually , as well as all possible combinations of the three members , was performed ( Fig . 13A ) . While knockdown of ephrinBs reduced the number of endocytosed EphB - ephrinB clusters as expected , neither knockdown of single Cdc42 subfamily GTPases nor any combination of knockdowns showed a significant change in the number of endocytosed clusters compared to scramble control condition ( Fig . 13C ) . As the data for the Rac subfamily GTPases suggested that different endocytic processes are employed in the trans - endocytosis assay and for the internalisation of soluble pre - clustered Eph ectodomains I also tested whether the Cdc42 subfamily members are involved in endocytosis of soluble EphB2 ectodomains into ephrinB + cells . Combined siRNA knockdown of Cdc42 , RhoQ and RhoU was performed in SKN cells , which were subsequently stimulated with pre - clustered EphB2 - Fc ( Fig . 13B ) . Compared with scramble control oligos , treatment with oligos against Cdc42 subfamily GTPases showed no significant difference in the number of endocytosed EphB - ephrinB clusters ( Fig . 13D ) . Results 74 Taking into consideration results from both the trans - endocytosis assay and the assay with soluble EphB ectodomains , our data suggest that members of the Cdc42 subfamily of Rho GTPases do not play a key role for EphB - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells .

Results 75 Results 76 2 . 2 . 5 Knockdown of RhoA subfamily GTPases does not significantly alter EphB trans ‐ endocytosis into ephrinB + cells The third major subfamily of Rho GTPases is the RhoA subfamily , of which RhoA , RhoB , are expressed in both SKN and HeLa cells ( Fig . 4 ) . While RhoA has been shown to be important for signalling events downstream of Eph - ephrin interactions , especially in the context of growth cone collapse ( Shamah et al . 2001 , Sahin et al . 2005 , Takeuchi et al . 2015 ) , there have been no direct links so far to the endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes . To study the involvement of Rho subfamily GTPases in EphB trans - endocytosis , we first performed siRNA experiments in the trans - endocytosis assay using SKN cells co - cultured with HeLa cells expressing EphB2  C - GFP as described above . RhoA and RhoB were knocked down individually , as well as in combination . In Figure 14 both the example images ( Fig . 14A ) and the quantification ( Fig . 14B ) revealed that there is no significant difference between knockdown of Rho family proteins and scramble oligos , while knockdown of ephrinBs significantly reduced the amount of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + SKN cells . We also performed experiments with HeLa cells as both donor and acceptor cells to further confirm that RhoA subfamily GTPases are not relevant in the context of EphB trans - endocytosis . As acceptor cells HeLa cells transiently expressing ephrinB1 - mCherry were treated with siRNA against RhoA , RhoB , a combination of the two , or with scramble oligos . They were co - cultured with HeLa cells expressing EphB2  C - GFP to induce EphB trans - endocytosis into the acceptor cells . RhoA single and RhoA and RhoB double knockdowns led to a slight increase in the number of internalised Eph - ephrin complexes per cell in compared to scramble oligo treatment ( 47 . 11 and 47 . 87 , internalised vesicles / cell compared to 42 . 37 internalised vesicles / cell ) . However , statistical testing with  = 0 . 05 revealed these results to be non - significant ( Fig . 14C ) . Since the experiments using SKN cells showed no change in the number of internalised Eph - ephrin clusters , and the observed difference in HeLa cells is not statistically significant , these results indicate that RhoA subfamily GTPases are not involved in the regulation of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . This conclusion is further supported by the high effectiveness of siRNA knockdown of RhoA subfamily GTPases , which excludes insufficient knockdown as an explanation for the lack of an effect . Results 77 Figure 14 .

Results 78 2 . 2 . 6 Knockdown of RhoA subfamily GTPases enhances the endocytosis of soluble EphB2 ectodomains into ephrinB + cells Although knocking down RhoA and RhoB in either SKN or HeLa cells showed no significant change in the EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , I was also interested to see whether the same is true for endocytosis of soluble EphB ectodomains . Therefore , I knocked down RhoA , RhoB or a combination of the two proteins in SKN cells , which were subsequently incubated with pre - clustered EphB2 - Fc as described before ( Fig . 15A ) . Strikingly , I observed a very strong increase in the amount of internalised EphB - ephrinB clusters after knocking down RhoA subfamily GTPases when compared to scramble control oligos ( Fig . 15C ) . For treatment with either siRNA for RhoA or the combination of oligos for RhoA and RhoB , the increase was almost two - fold , while for a knockdown of RhoB alone the increase was 1 . 5 - fold . Since the combined knockdown of RhoA and RhoB did not result in a stronger effect than knockdown of RhoA alone , these results imply that RhoA is the main mediator of this physiological function . These results further indicate that RhoA subfamily GTPases limit the rate of endocytosis of soluble EphB2 ectodomains into ephrinB + cells . However , a potential alternate explanation for the increase in internalised EphB - ephrinB complexes , could be that RhoA subfamily GTPases regulate their downstream trafficking . Indeed , RhoB , and to a lesser extent RhoA , have been reported to regulate endocytic trafficking ( Gampel et al . 1999 , Fernandez - Borja et al . 2005 , Rondanino et al . 2007 , Stirling et al . 2009 ) . Disturbing RhoB function interferes with transition from early endosomal compartments to later stages of endocytic processing such as multivesicular bodies , and results in smaller endocytic vesicles ( Fernandez - Borja et al . 2005 ) . A blocked fusion of early endosomes with later endocytic compartments could explain the higher number of endocytic vesicles observed in my experiments . Curiously , I also observed that the endocytic vesicles are also significantly smaller on average in the knockdown of RhoA and the combined knockdown of RhoA and RhoB compared to control ( Fig . 15E ) , providing further evidence for this hypothesis . In order to confirm the role of RhoA subfamily proteins in the endocytosis of soluble EphB2 ectodomains , I transfected HeLa cells with ephrinB1 - mCherry and treated them Results 79 with siRNA for RhoA subfamily proteins or scramble control oligo ( Fig . 15B ) . While knockdown of RhoA subfamily proteins resulted in an increase in the number of endocytosed Eph - ephrin clusters ( 27 . 98 for RhoA , and 29 . 24 for RhoA and RhoB , compared to 21 . 3 internalised vesicles / cell for scramble control ) , statistical testing with  0 . 05 as significance level revealed the difference to be non - significant ( Fig . 15D ) . The observed increase in endocytosis in HeLa cells ( 25 - 50 % for RhoA single and RhoA and RhoB double knockdown , 10 - 20 % for RhoB single knockdown compared to control levels ) is furthermore very modest compared to the substantial increase observed in SKN cells ( 150 - 200 % compared to control levels ) . A potential explanation for this discrepancy can be found in the distinct experimental setups . Given that ephrinB1 - mCherry needs to be over - expressed in HeLa cells , there is more ephrinB available on the cell surface compared to SKN cells , which endogenously express ephrinBs . The higher level of ephrinB expression on the cell surface leads to more binding opportunities for EphB2 - Fc and in consequence , to more clusters forming and being internalised than under control conditions ( 8 . 1 clusters / cell in SKN cells , 21 . 3 clusters / cell in HeLa cells ) . The endocytic machinery of the HeLa cell is possibly already working close to its maximum capacity and therefore removal of RhoA subfamily proteins cannot exert as substantial an effect on the amount of endocytosis as it does in SKN cells . This could result in the difference between scramble oligo treatment and treatment with siRNA against RhoA subfamily members being non - significant in the experiments with HeLa cells .

To further explore the regulation of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells we performed an image - based siRNA screen for Rho - family GEFs and GAPs . We bioinformatically identified human Rho - family GEFs and GAPs by searching for proteins containing either a RhoGAP , a DH , or a DOCK domain . Our search resulted in 61 GAPs , 11 DOCK - family GEFs and 67 Dbl - family GEFs . For each gene we used four different siRNA oligos with non - overlapping sequences . The scheme in Figure 16A provides an overview of the procedure and workflow of the screen . In principle , we used the same cell - cell assay as with the siRNA experiments with Rho - family GTPases . SKN H2B - RFP cells were seeded into 96 - well plates and reverse transfected with siRNA oligos . The siRNA library consisted of 4 individual oligos per target gene , distributed in individual wells amongst 13 plates . Each plate also contained a set of control conditions : one well with siRNA oligo against kiff11 as a control for successful transfection ( knockdown of kiff11 leads to an inhibition of mitosis and thus , cell Results 82 death ) ; six wells of scramble oligos as negative controls ; two wells with oligos against ephrinB2 as a positive control , resulting in partial inhibition of endocytosis ; and three wells with a combination of oligos against both ephrinB1 and ephrinB2 , resulting in an almost complete abolition of EphB2 uptake . Two runs with the full set of oligos were performed . The co - culture assay and analysis of images with CellProfiler TM software was performed as described before and in section 4 . 2 . 12 . For each well the percentage of cells with more than a given number of vesicles was calculated . The number of vesicles for this cut - off was adjusted for each plate so that the negative controls showed a value of close to 40 % of cells above the cut - off , to normalise for inter - plate variations in the levels of endocytosis . The value of 40 % was chosen , since it allowed for very good discrimination against the two positive controls ( Fig . 16B and C ) . From these cut - off values , z - scores were calculated for each oligo as described in Figure 16E . We regarded all results with z - scores below - 2 as a hit for a decrease in endocytosis and all results with a z - score above 2 . 5 as a hit for an increase in endocytosis . The false positive rates for negative controls with these cut - offs were 2 . 9 % for a decrease in endocytosis and 0 . 7 % for an increase in endocytosis . Furthermore , 12 . 3 % of ephrinB2 single depletions and 1 . 9 % of ephrinB1 and ephrinB2 double knockdowns resulted in a false negative result ( Fig . 16F ) . Figure 16 D shows a graph depicting the z - scores of all oligos tested . With z - score cut - offs at - 2 and 2 . 5 the large majority of oligos from the siRNA library ( 95 % ) resulted in no significant change in the EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . A list of oligos targeting GEF proteins with z - scores above and below the cut - offs is displayed in Figure 16G . Among the proteins for which siRNA oligo treatment resulted in a decrease of Eph - ephrin endocytosis , only for Dock11 more than one oligo fell below the - 2 cut - off . However , these results represented three separate oligos , and none of them showed an effect below cut - off in repeat runs . Hence , we extended the number of oligos taken into consideration by including those barely missing the cut - off with a z - score of - 1 . 9 . Both ITSN1 and ELMO3 had one oligo each with a z - score of - 1 . 9 , in addition to one oligo scoring below the original cut - off value . For ITSN1 , these two values derived from the same oligo in the two separate runs , suggesting a robust response . The oligos resulting in an increase of endocytosis did not give a clear result , as no candidate showed a z - score above the cut - off value in both Results 83 runs . Thus , we focused our follow - up analysis first on candidates leading to a decrease in endocytosis . Figure 16 .

Results 84 Results 85 2 . 3 . 1 ITSN1 cannot be confirmed as a regulator of EphB trans ‐ endocytosis into ephrinB + cells The single strongest result from the screen was the effect of one oligo for ITSN1 , which markedly decreased the amount of observed internalisation of Eph - ephrin complexes into ephrinB + cells ( z - scores - 3 . 9 and - 1 . 9 , Fig . 17B ) . Interestingly , ITSN1 , a Cdc42 - specific GEF , has already been implicated as a mediator of Eph - ephrin signalling in the context of dendritic spine development ( Irie & Yamaguchi 2002 , Nishimura et al . 2006 ) . However , no direct link had yet been discovered to the endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes and studies so far have only implicated ITSN1 in forward signalling . I therefore chose ITSN1 as the first candidate for subsequent follow - up experiments . In order to confirm the requirement of ITSN1 in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , I repeated the experiments using the same setup that was employed for the screen , but increased the number of images taken per condition in order to achieve greater accuracy in the analysis . Since at least one oligo for ITSN2 also showed a trend to decrease trans - endocytosis of EphB2 receptors ( z - score - 1 . 53 and - 0 . 24 , Fig . 17B ) , and the high sequence similarity between ITSN1 and ITSN2 ( Tsyba et al . 2011 ) suggests a potential redundancy between these two proteins , I also included ITSN2 and a combination of oligos for ITSN1 and ITSN2 in the experiment . Surprisingly , follow - up experiments could not confirm the role of ITSN1 as a regulator of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , as there was no significant difference between the average number of internalised EphB - ephrinB complexes in cells treated with ITSN1 oligo and cells treated with scramble oligo ( Fig . 17A and C ) . Furthermore , knockdown of ITSN2 did not result in a significant difference in the amount of endocytosis either . The combined knockdown of ITSN1 and ITSN2 showed a trend towards a reduced number of endocytic events , however statistical analysis using  = 0 . 05 as a significance level revealed this difference to be non - significant . There are several potential explanations for these results . Of course , the most obvious being that the results from the screen were false positives and ITSN proteins are not required for Eph - ephrin reverse endocytosis . However , it could also be possible that ITSN proteins are involved in regulating the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , but that they are just one component in a highly complex endocytic machinery and that their role can also be fulfilled by other proteins . In this case , the physiological redundancy could overcome the Results 86 effect a knockdown of ITSN proteins has on the regulation of endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes . I tried to account for at least the possibility of redundancy between ITSN1 and ITSN2 by combining the knockdown of both proteins , which , despite showing a trend towards fewer endocytic events per cell , did not give a significant result . Still it is possible that proteins other than members of the ITSN family can substitute for their potential role in Eph - ephrin endocytosis in the absence of ITSN . This possibility was addressed by additional experiments ( see below ) . Finally , it is also conceivable that the effectiveness of the siRNA transfection and the resulting knockdown varied between experiments and that the knockdown effectiveness in the screen experiments was by chance higher than in the subsequent follow - up experiments , thus leading to a stronger effect . Figure 17 .

Results 87 Results 88 2 . 3 . 2 Combining siRNA against several candidates from the screen does not consistently inhibit EphB trans ‐ endocytosis into ephrinB + cells As the initial attempts to confirm the strongest candidate from the siRNA screen , ITSN1 , were not successful , I considered several explanations . One possible explanation is that due to redundancy on both the level of the Rho GTPases , as well as at the level of the GEFs and GAPs , it is difficult to obtain consistent results . I therefore addressed whether combining siRNA knockdown of two proteins that showed a decrease in endocytosis in the screen could overcome this redundancy . Two different combinations of oligos , both employing a different line of reasoning , were tested . Firstly , our analysis of the screen revealed that GEFs , whose knockdown leads to a decrease in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , are mainly active on GTPases of the Rac and Cdc42 subfamilies , and not the RhoA subfamily ( Fig . 16G ) . According to the literature , ITSN1 is mainly active on Cdc42 , while FARP2 exhibits GEF activity towards both Cdc422 and Rac ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) . For both of these proteins siRNA oligos scored below the z - score cut - off ( Fig . 18B ) . I therefore combined the oligos for these two genes in order to inhibit Rac and Cdc42 activity at the same time . Furthermore , the atypical DOCK subfamily of GEFs has been proposed to only exhibit its GEF function when acting in a complex with proteins of the ELMO family ( Laurin & Cote 2014 ) . Since both knockdown of a member of the DOCK subfamily of GEFs ( Dock11 ) , and knockdown of ELMO3 showed a decrease in the endocytosis of EphB2 , we also tested a combination of oligos for these two genes . The same general experimental setup as for the screen was utilised : HeLa cells stably expressing the EphB2  C - GFP construct as donor cells and SKN H2B - RFP treated with siRNA oligos as acceptor cells . The combination of oligos was used at a concentration of 10 nM for each oligo ( 20 nM final concentration ) , while knockdown of single genes was performed using a concentration of 20 nM of each oligo . EphB trans - endocytosis was reduced by siRNA treatment for ephrinB2 or both ephrinB1 and ephrinB2 in SKN cells ( images not shown ) . Treatment with siRNA for any of the four target genes alone ( images not shown ) , or with a combination of oligos for Dock11 and ELMO3 or FARP2 and ITSN1 did not significantly change the number of internalised Eph - ephrin clusters per cell when compared to treatment with scramble oligo ( Fig . 18A and C ) . Results 89 Taking into consideration all the results from the follow - up analysis which could not consistently confirm any of the candidates , we concluded that identifying hits from the screen solely by examining strong results from a single oligo did not provide reliable candidates for the regulation of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . While there are still potential explanations for the discrepancy between the screen results and follow - up experiments , for example , variations in knockdown effectiveness between experiments , or a level of redundancy between GEF proteins that cannot be overcome by the combined knockdown of only two different proteins ; we decided to re - evaluate the criteria for identifying candidate genes from the screen data . Results 90 Figure 18 .

Our initial approach focused on strong z - scores , preferably in two runs for the same oligo , regardless of whether the other oligos against the same gene also showed an effect or not . The reasoning behind that being that potentially not all siRNA oligos actually result in an effective knockdown of the target protein . The alternate approach we subsequently employed was to search for consistent responses in the average of all 4 oligos tested , while being more lenient with the cut - off of z - scores which were regarded as a hit ( - 1 . 25 instead of - 2 , and 1 . 75 instead of 2 . 5 ) . Furthermore , to account for high inter - plate variability in the results , z - scores were calculated for each plate individually instead of taking the average of the controls from the entire screen ( Fig . 19B ) . Figure 19A illustrates all z - scores calculated this way and Table 1 and Table 2 show the z - scores listed for all tested proteins . With these criteria , 8 % of negative controls showed a significant response , while 1 % of ephrinB2 and 0 % of ephrinB1 and ephrinB2 combined knockdowns failed to show a significant reduction in trans - endocytosis ( Fig . 19C ) . In Figure 19D and E , the tested GEFs and GAPs are displayed , with the average of the two runs for each oligo depicted in a colour code and ranked from left to right according to their overall average z - scores from lowest to highest . Also with this new approach , the majority of tested oligos did not result in a significant alteration of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . The candidates identified , however , differed from the previous analysis ( compare Fig . 16 ) . Figure 19F shows example images for the two strongest hits that decrease endocytosis ( Tiam2 and Vav1 ) , as well as for the strongest candidate that increased the amount of internalised Eph - ephrin complexes ( Net1 ) . Tiam2 itself has not yet been mentioned in the context of Eph - ephrin endocytosis , but it shares high sequence homology with Tiam1 ( Matsuo et al . 2003 ) , which in turn is a known player in endocytosis of soluble ephrinA ectodomains into EphA + cells ( Yoo et al . 2011 , Boissier et al . 2013 , Um et al . 2014 ) . Vav1 is a close homologue of Vav2 and Vav3 ( Fujikawa et al . 2003 , Results 92 Pearce et al . 2004 ) , which have already been described to also regulate endocytosis of soluble ephrinA ectodomains into EphA + cells ( Cowan et al . 2005 ) . The fact that the GEF showing the strongest increase in trans - endocytosis , Net1 , is known to be specific for RhoA subfamily GTPases ( Alberts & Treisman 1998 , Srougi & Burridge 2011 ) is remarkable for two reasons . Firstly , despite no significant effect being observed for RhoA subfamily knockdown in EphB trans - endocytosis into SKN cells , the trend of an increase in endocytosis into ephrinB1 - expressing HeLa cells ( Fig . 14 ) , and even more so , the strong increase in endocytosis observed in experiments using soluble EphB2 ectodomains ( Fig . 15 ) , suggest a possible role of RhoA subfamily GTPases as negative regulators of Eph - ephrin endocytosis . Secondly , given that the strongest candidates of the GEFs resulting in a decrease of trans - endocytosis are either Rac subfamily specific ( Tiam2 ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) ) or have been shown for to be active towards Rac in their physiological functions ( Vav1 ( Villalba et al . 2001 ) ) , the screen data also suggest a potential antagonism between Rac subfamily members and RhoA subfamily members in the regulation of Eph - ephrin endocytosis . Similar antagonism between these two signalling pathways has been reported in several other physiological contexts ( Guilluy et al . 2011 ) Figure 19 .

similarity with Tiam1 ( Matsuo et al . 2002 , Terawaki et al . 2010 ) . In a study by Tanaka and colleagues preliminary data indicated that Tiam2 is able to bind to ephrinB1 in similar fashion to Tiam1 ( Tanaka et al . 2004 ) . Our screen data revealed that across all four siRNA oligos used against Tiam2 , the number of internalised Eph - ephrin clusters was reduced when compared to scramble control condition . Knockdown of Tiam1 , on the other hand , which had already been implicated in endocytosis of soluble ephrinA ectodomains into EphA + cells ( Yoo et al . 2010 , Um et al . 2014 ) , did not show any effect on EphB trans - endocytosis into SKN cells . In order to confirm the involvement of Tiam2 in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , we repeated the experiments in the same setup used for the screen , but for each experiment the treatments were performed in triplicate to improve the validity of the results . Since Tiam1 had been previously shown to be involved in endocytosis of soluble ephrin ectodomains , we decided to also re - test Tiam1 . These follow - up experiments confirmed the results from the screen . Knockdown of Tiam2 led to a significant reduction of EphB trans - endocytosis into SKN cells , while knockdown of Tiam1 resulted in no detectable effect ( Fig . 20B ) . Next , we wanted to establish , whether Tiam2 was also required for efficient EphB trans - endocytosis into other ephrinB + cell lines . We therefore conducted co - culture experiments using two types of HeLa cells transiently expressing ephrinB1 - mCherry and EphB2  C - GFP respectively . In addition to the siRNA knockdown of Tiam2 , we again included knockdown of Tiam1 in the experimental conditions ( Fig . 20A , top panel ) . Furthermore , to account for potential redundancy between the closely related Tiam proteins , we also tested a combined knockdown using oligos against both Tiam1 and Tiam2 ( images not shown ) . We observed a significant decrease in trans - endocytosis upon knockdown of Tiam2 in HeLa cells , replicating the findings from SKN cells ( Fig . 20C ) . In contrast to the results from SKN cells , knockdown of Tiam1 also resulted in a significant decrease of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB1 - expressing HeLa cells . A combination of oligos against Tiam2 and Tiam1 led to a significant reduction in trans - endocytosis as well , however , the combined effect was no larger than the effect of single knockdowns of either Results 101 Tiam2 or Tiam1 . The results from the combined knockdown could suggest a combinatorial requirement of Tiam1 and Tiam2 for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB1 - expressing HeLa cells instead of functional redundancy between the two . Another potential explanation for not observing an increase in the effect of the combined knockdown as compared to the single knockdowns , could be the fact that in the combined knockdown only half the concentration of each single oligo is used , potentially decreasing knockdown effectiveness and thus weakening the effect . Tiam1 had already been reported to be a regulator of Eph - ephrin endocytosis , however these experiments were performed with soluble pre - clustered ephrinA ectodomains into EphA + cells and the role of Tiam2 was not addressed ( Yoo et al . 2010 , Um et al . 2014 ) . Thus , to determine whether reverse and forward trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes make use of the same molecular machinery , we performed co - culture experiments with HeLa cells transiently transfected with either EphB2 - mCherry or ephrinB1  C - GFP , thus only allowing endocytosis into the EphB2 - expressing cell ( forward direction ) . We tested the same siRNA treatments as in the reverse direction ( Fig . 20A , bottom panel ) . Indeed , knockdown of Tiam1 , Tiam2 , or both proteins combined caused a reduction in the number of Eph - ephrin complexes internalised into HeLa cells . As in the reverse direction , combined knockdown of Tiam1 and Tiam2 did not result in a more pronounced effect on the number of internalised vesicles ( Fig . 20D ) . Taken together , these results suggest that the molecular mechanism for trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes is either the same or , at least shares overlapping molecular players in the forward and reverse direction . In both directions , activity of Rac subfamily GTPases is required , which is very likely induced by GEFs of the Tiam family . Results 102 Figure 20 .

Results 103 2 . 4 . 2 Tiam family proteins are not required for the endocytosis of soluble EphB2 ectodomains into ephrinB + cells Given the differential requirement for Rac subfamily GTPases for endocytosis of membrane - tethered and soluble EphBs , I investigated whether the same is true for the Tiam family proteins , given their role as Rac - specific GEFs . I knocked down the expression of Tiam1 and Tiam2 in SKN cells using siRNA either individually or in combination and stimulated the cells with soluble EphB ectodomains described before ( Fig . 21A ) . Neither individual knockdown of either Tiam1 or Tiam2 , nor combined knockdown of both proteins at the same time ( images not shown ) , resulted in a significant change in the number of internalised Eph - ephrin clusters ( Fig . 21B ) . The differential requirement for Tiam family proteins between the trans - endocytosis assay and the stimulation with soluble EphB ectodomains fit nicely with the observation that also Rac subfamily GTPases are only required for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , when the receptor is membrane - tethered , but not upon stimulation with soluble EphB ectodomains .

In brief , trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes in both the forward ( Fig . 22C ) and reverse ( Fig . 22D ) directions requires Tiam - induced Rac activity , probably in order to drive polymerisation of the actin cytoskeleton to allow for the pinching off of whole receptor - ligand complexes including pieces of the opposing membrane . Rac activity controls EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + SKN cells ( Fig . 8 ) , HeLa cells ( Fig . 9 ) , and primary cortical neurons ( Fig . 10 ) . These findings show that the general mechanism described in this study is not cell - type - specific and relevant in physiological contexts , where Eph - ephrin signalling is important . For endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes induced by soluble ephrin ectodomains ( forward direction ) , Tiam - induced Rac activity is also required . However , previous work also suggests that these complexes are internalised via Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) ( Yoo et al . 2010 ) , which can represent either an overlapping or parallel pathway ( Fig . 22A ) . The reverse endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes induced by stimulation with soluble EphB ectodomains does not require Rac or Tiam activity . Curiously , we also found that RhoA subfamily GTPases inhibit or at least slow down the rate of internalisation ( Fig . 22B ) . While also for reverse endocytosis induced by stimulation with soluble Eph ectodomains evidence implicating the importance of the CME pathways exists ( Parker et al . 2004 ) , the exact molecular mechanism underlying this endocytic route still remains to be elucidated . In the following chapters I will discuss the results from this study in more detail , as well as provide an outlook on possible future directions of research building on this work . Discussion 106 Figure 22 . Updated models for endocytosis of Eph ‐ ephrin complexes ( A ) Forward endocytosis of Eph ‐ ephrin complexes induced by soluble pre ‐ clustered ephrin ectodomains .

Discussion 107 3 . 1 . 1 Which endocytic pathway does EphB ‐ ephrinB internalisation take ? As discussed in the introduction ( section 1 . 3 . 1 ) , endocytic processes can be distinguished by their underlying molecular machineries ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . Our findings suggest that Eph - ephrin complexes are internalised via different endocytic pathways , depending on whether they originate from stimulation with soluble fusion proteins or from cell contact - mediated Eph - ephrin signalling . The original work from Marston and co - workers , as well as Zimmer and colleagues showed that trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes does not occur via the clathrin - mediated pathway of endocytosis ( CME ) , at least in the forward direction , as EphB - ephrinB complexes internalised by trans - endocytosis do not co - localise with clathrin - coated pits ( Marston et al . 2003 , Zimmer et al . 2003 ) . Since also no co - localisation of Eph - ephrin clusters with caveolin could be detected , Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis should also be independent of the caveolae - mediated endocytic pathway . Among the well - described endocytic pathways , macropinocytosis and phagocytosis are reliant on Rac activity ( Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . These two pathways both involve the uptake of relatively large cargo : either only to some extent discriminatively from the environment ( macropinocytosis ) or very selective uptake of pathogens or apoptotic bodies that have been primed for internalisation by specialised cells ( phagocytosis ) . Apart from being limited to specialised cells in the immune system , phagocytosis has been shown to require the orchestrated activity of several Rho family GTPases ( Massol et al . 1998 , deBakker et al . 2004 , Flannagan et al . 2012 ) and should thus be sensitive to disturbance of additional Rho subfamilies other than only Rac . As our experiments , however , only show the requirement of Rac subfamily GTPases and suggest that other Rho subfamilies are dispensable for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , and given that the endocytic uptake of Eph - ephrin complexes is not limited to the specialised cells traditionally thought to exhibit phagocytosis , it can be postulated that EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells is not mediated by canonical phagocytosis . Whereas macropinocytosis was originally thought to be involved mainly in the indiscriminate uptake of extracellular fluid and its content ( hence the Greek origin of the name : “large cell drinking” ) ( Swanson & Watts 1995 ) , it has later emerged that macropinocytosis also regulates the selective internalisation Discussion 108 of large patches of activated RTKs ( Orth et al . 2006 ) . Macropinocytosis is characterised by the formation of dorsal membrane ruffles , which requires the activity of Rac subfamily GTPases ( Rac1 and RhoG ) and their downstream effector PAK to initiate the reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton required ( Swanson & Watts 1995 , Dharmawardhane et al . 2000 , West et al . 2000 , Ellerbroek et al . 2004 , Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells also requires the uptake of large clusters and corresponding patches of membrane and is regulated by Rac subfamily GTPases , as shown in this study . Therefore , it is possible that Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis uses the macropinocytic pathway . To clarify whether Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis truly goes through canonical macropinocytosis or whether it simply shares some molecular components , further work will be required . Firstly , studies with siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of PAK ( Rudolph et al . 2015 ) could elucidate whether PAK is required downstream of Rac signalling in this context . Secondly , a unique feature of macropinocytosis is its susceptibility to inhibitors of Na + / H + exchange , such as amiloride ( West et al . 1989 , Veithen et al . 1996 , Koivusalo et al . 2010 ) . Thus , inhibition of Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis with amiloride might indicate that this process resembles macropinocytosis . As a preliminary conclusion , I suggest that Eph - ephrin complexes between two opposing cells may be internalised via a macropinocytosis - like pathway . Experiments performed using stimulation with soluble ectodomains in both the forward and reverse direction have provided some evidence for an involvement of the CME - pathway , as internalised Eph - ephrin complexes co - localised with markers of the CME - pathway ( Parker et al . 2004 , Yoo et al . 2010 ) . Nonetheless , the role of CME is still disputed , as several studies also postulate that Rac activity is necessary for internalisation into Eph - expressing cells after stimulation with soluble ephrin ectodomains ( Cowan et al . 2005 , Yoo et al . 2010 , Um et al . 2014 ) . Rac activity is traditionally not considered to be obligatory for CME to occur ( McMahon & Boucrot 2011 ) . Furthermore Cowan and colleagues also showed that upon knockout of Vav2 and Vav3 , which led to an inhibition of EphA endocytosis induced by soluble ephrinA ectodomains , the general CME pathway was still intact . Parker and colleagues reported that ephrin reverse endocytosis after stimulation with soluble EphB ectodomains is mediated by CME ( Parker et al . 2004 ) . They based their Discussion 109 claims on a combination of indirect observations ( co - localisation with CME - associated proteins after internalisation ) , and experiments not specific for CME ( transfection of a dominant negative version of dynamin , potassium depletion ) . Therefore more conclusive experiments , for example with direct siRNA knockdown of components of the clathrin - machinery , would be required to confirm that reverse endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes induced by soluble Eph ectodomains uses CME . However , as our results only indicate that Rac activity is not required for endocytosis of EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells , they do not contradict the findings of Parker and colleagues . Additionally , we found in our study that depletion of RhoA subfamily GTPases leads to an increase in endocytosis of soluble EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells . Since some evidence exists suggesting RhoA activity can negatively affect CME in some physiological contexts ( Lamaze et al . 1996 , Kaneko et al . 2005 , Khelfaoui et al . 2009 ) , these data are in agreement with the hypothesis that Eph - ephrin reverse endocytosis after stimulation with soluble Eph ectodomains occurs via CME . However , it should be noted that the literature on the role of RhoA subfamily GTPases in CME is contradictory , as positive regulation has also been reported ( Malaval et al . 2009 , Stirling et al . 2009 ) . An interesting feature of endocytosis induced by soluble ephrin or Eph ectodomains is the differential requirement of Rac activity between the forward and reverse directions . The evidence indicating CME is responsible for endocytosis of soluble ephrin ectodomains into Eph + cells is not very strong , as it only derives from co - localisation studies of CME - associated proteins with Ephs after internalisation ( Yoo et al . 2010 ) . Such co - localisation after internalisation could , however , also arise from trafficking of Eph - ephrin complexes internalised through clathrin - independent pathways into shared endosomal compartments . On the other hand , the requirement of Rac activity for endocytosis of soluble ephrin ectodomains into Eph + cells is fairly strong and has been replicated in several independent publications ( Cowan et al . 2005 , Yoo et al . 2010 , Yoo et al . 2011 , Um et al . 2014 ) , as well as in our study presented here ( Fig . 12 ) . Furthermore , additional experiments in our group revealed differential activation of Rac upon stimulation with either soluble pre - clustered ephrin or Eph ectodomains with a Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based probe for Rac activity ( Itoh et al . 2002 ) , emphasising that Rac is more strongly activated downstream of EphB receptors than ephrinBs ( T . Gaitanos , unpublished data ) . There are Discussion 110 several other conceivable explanations for the seemingly conflicting evidence regarding the involvement of both Rac activity and CME in endocytosis of soluble ephrin ectodomains into Eph + cells . Not only Rac activity , but also explicitly the GEFs Tiam1 , Vav2 and Vav3 have previously been implicated in Eph - ephrin endocytosis ( Cowan et al . 2005 , Yoo et al . 2010 , Um et al . 2014 ) , and the same signalling axis has been shown to regulate Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis in both directions in this study . Therefore , it is possible that trans - endocytosis and endocytosis of soluble ephrin ectodomains into Eph + cells share the same macropinocytosis - like pathway and CME is of subsidiary relevance . Still , there is also another potential explanation . The role of actin reorganisation in CME is still a matter of debate ( Mooren et al . 2012 ) . However , there are reports that indicate that endocytosis of the vesicular stomatitis virus occurs through CCPs and requires polymerisation of actin for its full - length form , while an artificially truncated version of the viral particle can be internalised via CME independently of actin ( Cureton et al . 2009 , Cureton et al . 2010 ) . Therefore , a difference in the size of Eph - ephrin clusters induced between forward and reverse signalling could be a potential explanation for the variance in the requirement of Rac activity for endocytosis . Once the initial cluster formation has been triggered by stimulation with ephrin , clusters of Eph receptors can propagate in size due to cis interactions independent of ephrin - binding ( Wimmer - Kleikamp et al . 2004 ) . However , no such propagation mechanism has been described for ephrins thus far . Hence , it is conceivable that Eph - ephrin clusters formed by stimulation with soluble ephrin ectodomains are larger than those formed after stimulation with soluble Eph ectodomains . Hence , it is possible that their internalisation requires an “extended” form of CME , which is also dependent on reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton triggered by Rac activity . Finally , it is also possible that two separate pathways , one Rac - dependent , the other clathrin - dependent , govern the internalisation of soluble ephrin ectodomains into Eph + cells . It would therefore be very informative to inhibit both pathways at the same time . Taking both the results presented in this study and previous literature into consideration , trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes can be linked to a macropinocytosis - ( like ) pathway , while the paradigm for endocytosis of clusters induced by soluble proteins is more nuanced and potentially involves CME as either the main , or at least one of several pathways . The evidence so far is not conclusive enough to firmly assign the endocytic Discussion 111 processes for Eph - ephrin complexes to any specific pathway . To further dissect the contribution of the individual endocytic pathways , careful analysis with manipulation of known molecular markers for the separate pathways should be conducted . Moreover , the possibility that Eph - ephrin endocytosis is governed by several pathways in parallel , or by pathways that are novel in their precise composition of regulating proteins and only partially overlap with well - characterised pathways , cannot be ruled out at this stage . Also the question in how far the endocytic pathways differ between forward and reverse directions and between EphA - ephrinA and EphB - ephrinB signalling was not completely answered yet . Here we show that for the trans - endocytosis with two opposing cells in contact the molecular regulators identified are the same for forward and reverse direction , while endocytosis after stimulation with soluble ectodomains differs in their requirement of Rac activity . Regarding the differences between the EphA and EphB systems our findings indicate that at least in the forward direction EphA and EphB endocytosis shares a common regulatory mechanism via Rac activity . While it should be noted that this assumption for EphAs is based primarily on data from studies with soluble ectodomains , it would also be interesting to examine whether trans - endocytosis also occurs in EphA - ephrinA signalling , or whether this system only relies on cleavage for cell detachment ( Hattori et al . 2000 , Janes et al . 2005 ) . Finally , another intriguing question is which molecular mechanisms govern the decision into which cell trans - endocytosis occurs under physiological conditions with both cells coming into contact expressing either wild type Eph or ephrin . 3 . 1 . 2 Physiological relevance of Eph ‐ ephrin endocytosis triggered by stimulation with soluble proteins In physiological situations both Ephs and ephrins are membrane - tethered when they engage in signalling . Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin clusters we observe in experiments during cell - contact mediated signalling more truthfully represents the endocytic process in vivo . Nonetheless , it is possible that the mechanisms for endocytosis upon stimulation with soluble ephrin or Eph ectodomains are also relevant in physiological settings . As Ephs and ephrins have been shown to be cleaved by metalloproteases ( Hattori et al . 2000 , Georgakopoulos et al . 2006 , Lin et al . 2008 , Inoue et Discussion 112 al . 2009 , Gatto et al . 2014 ) , it is possible that their shed ectodomains can bind to receptors or ligands as soluble proteins and elicit signalling , albeit weakly . If this were the case , then endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes would probably be regulated by the two distinct mechanisms in the forward and reverse direction described in this study ( Fig . 22A and B ) . However , so far cleavage of ephrins and Eph receptors has been thought of as an alternative mechanism for allowing cell detachment after initial adhesion due to receptor - ligand interactions , or a mechanism to fine - tune signalling responses by decreasing sensitivity , while no evidence for a signal - inducing role of the shed ectodomains has been found . Recent work in our laboratory has shown that both Ephs and ephrins are secreted in exosomes , which retain their signalling capabilities ( J . Gong , unpublished data ) . Exosome - induced ephrin signalling probably involves endocytosis and it would be interesting to investigate which endocytic mechanism is involved . It is possible that endocytosis of Eph - positive exosomes resembles Eph trans - endocytosis between two opposing cells , since the membranous nature of the exosome is more similar to a living cell than a soluble fusion protein . Further work will be required to assess the requirement of Rac activity and actin polymerization in this context . In conclusion , given our current understanding of Eph - ephrin signalling , the trans - endocytosis process orchestrated by Rac activity proposed in this study is highly relevant for the physiological role of Eph - ephrin signalling in mediating cell repulsion , while the divergent pathway for endocytosis of complexes induced by soluble proteins is of lesser importance unless a physiological role of soluble Eph or ephrin ectodomains is discovered . Therefore , it would be advisable that future studies of EphB endocytosis into ephrinB + cells are carried out in cell contact - mediated settings to obtain physiologically relevant results . Discussion 113 3 . 2 The role of Rho family GTPases in Eph ‐ ephrin endocytosis 3 . 2 . 1 Redundancy between Rac subfamily members in the regulation of EphB trans ‐ endocytosis into ephrinB + cells Our experiments in SKN cells , HeLa cells and cortical neurons all show the requirement of Rac activity for efficient EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . Interestingly , only the simultaneous , combined siRNA knockdown of all three Rac subfamily members expressed in the SKN cells used in this study ( Rac1 , Rac3 , and RhoG ) resulted in a significant reduction of EphB trans - endocytosis , indicating physiological redundancy between them . Redundancy between Rac1 and Rac3 has already been established in the literature ( Corbetta et al . 2009 ) . In contrast , despite its sequence similarity , RhoG has been suggested to activate Rac signalling instead of being redundant to it ( Katoh & Negishi 2003 , Hiramoto et al . 2006 , Katoh et al . 2006 ) . Still , others have found that RhoG has both distinct and shared signalling pathways with other Rac subfamily GTPases ( Wennerberg et al . 2002 ) . In this study , we carefully dissected the individual contributions of the separate Rac subfamily members by performing individual siRNA knockdowns , a combination of knockdowns of any two proteins , as well as all three at once . Neither depletion of any single Rac subfamily GTPase , nor the combined knockdown of any two subfamily members significantly reduced EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . An effect was only observed when Rac1 , Rac3 , and RhoG were knocked down simultaneously . These results suggest that for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells the three Rac subfamily GTPases are physiologically redundant . Marston and colleagues had previously implicated Rac1 in the regulation of Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis in the forward direction by transfecting cells with a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 ( Marston et al . 2003 ) . These experiments do not rule out the possibility that in the forward direction activity of different Rac subfamily members is also physiologically redundant , since the dominant negative mutant potentially inhibits all family members by sequestering shared regulators and effectors . Notably , despite a significant decrease in the amount of internalised Eph - ephrin complexes in cells treated with siRNA against Rac subfamily members or the Rac inhibitor EHT1864 , EphB trans - endocytosis is not completely abolished ( Fig . 8 ) . This is either due to the Discussion 114 treatments not sufficiently inhibiting Rac function , or it could be due to the possibility that EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells can also be mediated by an alternative Rac - independent mechanism . 3 . 2 . 2 The role of Cdc42 signalling in Eph ‐ ephrin endocytosis The results in this study indicate that activity of the Cdc42 subfamily of Rho GTPases is not involved in both EphB trans - endocytosis and endocytosis of soluble EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells ( Fig . 13 ) . However , these results do not exclude the possibility that Cdc42 plays a minor role in EphB trans - endocytosis , which is masked by redundancy from Rac subfamily GTPases . Since both the knockdown of Rac subfamily members and pharmacological inhibition of Rac activity with EHT1864 did not completely block EphB trans - endocytosis and Rac and Cdc42 signalling has been reported to be redundant in certain physiological contexts ( Izumi et al . 2004 , Watanabe et al . 2004 ) , it is conceivable that Cdc42 subfamily GTPases contribute to EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells in the absence of Rac activity . One way to address this possibility could be a combination of pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown to target both subfamilies simultaneously . Initial analysis of the GEF / GAP screen resulted in the Cdc42 - specific GEF ITSN1 as a candidate for regulating EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . However , both follow - up experiments and re - analysis of the screen data with a higher emphasis on consistency did not confirm ITSN1 as a regulator of EphB trans - endocytosis . Nonetheless , ITSN1 has previously been shown to be an important signalling component downstream of EphB receptors in the regulation of dendritic development ( Irie & Yamaguchi 2002 , Nishimura et al . 2006 ) . Moreover , ITSN1 has also been implicated in the regulation of axon guidance at the cortical midline ( Sengar et al . 2013 ) , a feature it shares with Eph - ephrin reverse signalling ( Kullander et al . 2001a , Mendes et al . 2006 , Otal et al . 2006 ) , which could imply that ITSN1 is also involved in Eph - ephrin signalling in this context . However , these results implicate ITSN1 downstream of Eph - ephrin forward signalling , while I examined the regulation of EphB reverse trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . Therefore I cannot exclude that ITSN1 is involved in the regulation of ephrin trans - endocytosis into Eph + cells . It is also possible that ITSN1 fulfils functions not linked to Discussion 115 regulating Eph - ephrin endocytosis . Due to its nature as a multi - domain protein it could be required for the regulation of the endocytosis of target proteins triggered by Eph - ephrin signalling , or for the stabilisation of protein complexes as a scaffolding protein , as it has been described in other physiological scenarios ( Tsyba et al . 2011 , Wong et al . 2012 ) . 3 . 2 . 3 The role of RhoA subfamily GTPases in Eph endocytosis into ephrinB + cells RhoA is well established as a downstream effector of Eph - ephrin signalling , especially in the contexts of growth cone collapse and cell retraction ( Shamah et al . 2001 , Sahin et al . 2005 , Groeger & Nobes 2007 , Takeuchi et al . 2015 ) . So far , however , RhoA - like GTPases have not been described in the context of endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes . The results of this study reveal a complex picture for their involvement in Eph - ephrin reverse endocytosis . Experiments with soluble EphB2 ectodomain stimulation in SKN cells showed a very strong phenotype for the knockdown of RhoA subfamily GTPases . The observed increase in the amount of Eph - ephrin complexes internalised after EphB2 - Fc stimulation was highly significant in both the knockdown of RhoA or RhoB individually , or in a combination of the two . ( Fig . 15C ) . Remarkably , the effect was stronger for the RhoA single and RhoA and RhoB double knockdown than for the RhoB single knockdown . Surprisingly , analogous experiments in HeLa cells did not result in a statistically significant increase in endocytosis , although a trend in the same direction was observed ( Fig . 15D ) . This discrepancy either reveals a cell type - specific effect for RhoA subfamily activity on endocytosis of EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells , or it could be explained by the circumstances of the artificial overexpression system used for the experiments in HeLa cells , with the sheer amount of available ephrin protein at the cell surface masking any effect resulting in an increase of endocytic events . One possible explanation for the effect of the depletion of RhoA subfamily GTPases on endocytosis of soluble EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells could be derived from their role in inhibiting CME . Previous work by Parker and colleagues suggests that endocytosis of EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells is mediated by CME ( Parker et al . 2004 ) . RhoA activity , often conferred through its effector ROCK , has been shown to negatively regulate CME in several cellular contexts ( Lamaze et al . 1996 , Kaneko et al . 2005 , Khelfaoui et al . Discussion 116 2009 ) . It should be noted , however , that there are also reports providing evidence for a positive role of RhoA signalling in stimulating CME ( Malaval et al . 2009 , Stirling et al . 2009 ) . Our findings are in agreement with the first line of evidence and would thus argue for a direct involvement of RhoA subfamily GTPases in negatively regulating endocytosis of soluble EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells . An alternative explanation for the role of RhoA subfamily GTPases in endocytosis of EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells is that they do not directly inhibit the internalisation , but rather are required for subsequent endocytic trafficking . RhoB is a well - established regulator of endosomal trafficking that facilitates the transition of early endosomes towards the lysosomal or recycling compartments , while not effecting endocytic uptake per se ( Gampel et al . 1999 , Fernandez - Borja et al . 2005 , Rondanino et al . 2007 ) . Endosomes in cells with aberrant RhoB function are smaller than those under control condition and are observed in unusual cellular locations ( Fernandez - Borja et al . 2005 ) . Also in my experiments the endocytosed vesicles in SKN cells stimulated with soluble EphB2 ectodomains are significantly smaller upon knockdown of RhoA or a combined knockdown of RhoA and RhoB ( Fig . 15E ) . This could indicate that the RhoA subfamily phenotype , at least to some extent , originates from a defect in endosomal trafficking . If the effect of RhoA subfamily depletion in Eph - ephrin endocytosis was due to aberrant endosomal trafficking , one would expect that knockdown of RhoB results in a stronger effect as compared to RhoA . My data , curiously , presents the opposite result . This should not be seen as a definitive argument against the hypothesis of an effect on endosomal trafficking , as also some evidence for a role of RhoA itself in endosomal trafficking has been reported ( Nishimura et al . 2002 , Stirling et al . 2009 ) . Additionally , the preferential requirement of RhoA over RhoB might be a peculiarity of the Eph - ephrin system . On the basis of the presented data , several plausible explanations for the role of RhoA subfamily GTPases in endocytosis of soluble EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells can be given . In order to clarify the mechanisms involved and test for the role of endosomal trafficking , the interaction of Eph - ephrin endosomes with members of the Rab family GTPases could be studied , which are known regulators of endocytic trafficking events ( Wandinger - Ness & Zerial 2014 ) . An alternative or complimentary route of inquiry could Discussion 117 be the visualisation of the steps of endocytic processing using super resolution live cell - imaging . In contrast to the results from the soluble assay , the trans - endocytosis assay with SKN cells resulted in no change in the amount of internalised complexes when compared to the control condition . Still , experiments in HeLa cells again displayed a trend towards an increase in endocytosis , which tested as statistically insignificant ( Fig . 14 ) . Interestingly , the trend for an increase in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB - expressing HeLa cells was restricted to RhoA knockdown or a combination of RhoA and RhoB , while RhoB depletion alone showed trans - endocytosis exactly at control levels . This pattern is remarkably similar to the results obtained in the assay with soluble ectodomains ( Fig . 15 ) , but of course , without being statistically significant . One piece of evidence supporting some relevance of RhoA activity , also for EphB trans - endocytosis , can be drawn from the results of the GEF / GAP screen . The GEF showing the strongest increase in endocytosis when depleted was Net1 . Net1 is a RhoA - specific GEF , which has been found to co - localise with RhoA in the nucleus ( Alberts & Treisman 1998 , Schmidt & Hall 2002b ) . So far no reports linking Net1 to endocytosis exist . Interestingly , one study suggests that Rac1 activity can increase Net1 GEF activity , thus suggesting a positive reinforcement from Rac to RhoA signalling ( Carr et al . 2013 ) , whereas an earlier study described Rac and PAK - dependent down - regulation of Net1 activity , which is more in line with the usual counteractive role of Rac and RhoA signalling ( Alberts et al . 2005 ) . Taken together with the well - established antagonistic role of RhoA and Rac signalling ( Guilluy et al . 2011 ) , these findings could imply that RhoA signalling can have a minor inhibiting effect on EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . However , the evidence for this hypothesis is diminished by results from knockdown of RhoGAP OPHN1 in our screen . OPHN1 regulates RhoA activity in vivo and is reported to release the inhibitory effect of RhoA signalling on CME of synaptic receptors , which is required for proper neural development ( Fauchereau et al . 2003 , Govek et al . 2004 , Khelfaoui et al . 2009 ) . According to the hypothesis of RhoA as a negative regulator of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , depletion of OPHN1 should increase RhoA activity and thus lead to a decrease in trans - endocytosis . Our screen data reveals the exact opposite effect , with knockdown of OPHN1 resulting not only in an increase in trans - endocytosis , but it being one of the strongest Discussion 118 candidates ( Fig . 19 ) . A suitable explanation for this conflicting result could be that OPHN1 also possesses GAP activity for Rac1 and Cdc42 , at least in vitro ( Billuart et al . 1998 ) , which could be the mechanism of action preferentially active in the context of EphB trans - endocytosis . In any case , more work , also addressing the validity of the tools used ( for example , confirmation of siRNA knockdown effectiveness ) , would need to be conducted before final conclusions on the role of RhoA subfamily GTPases in trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes can be drawn . Another potential explanation for the discrepancy between the results from the trans - endocytosis assay and the assay with soluble EphB ectodomains could be that the two assays operate at different levels of sensitivity . Since trans - endocytosis can only occur at sites of cell contact , this could be a rate - limiting factor and mask effects a putative disinhibition of trans - endocytosis by knockdown of RhoA subfamily GTPases could exert . In contrast when saturated with soluble EphB ectodomains no such limitations exist and a knockdown of RhoA subfamily GTPases leads to an increase in endocytosis . In this study we did not investigate the role of RhoA subfamily GTPases in endocytic processes in the forward direction . As the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes in both directions seem to share the same endocytic pathway and knockdown of RhoA subfamily GTPases did not significantly alter the amount of endocytosis observed for EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , it would be reasonable that the same is true in the forward direction . Nonetheless , experiments confirming this assumption would give further support to the hypothesis that trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes uses the same endocytic machinery in both the forward and reverse directions . Considering the differential requirements for Rac activity in the soluble endocytosis assays with either ephrin or Eph ectodomains , and that CME has been implicated in the forward direction ( Yoo et al . 2010 ) , it would be intriguing to address the question of whether RhoA subfamily GTPases also exhibit an inhibitory function towards endocytosis of soluble ephrin ectodomains into Eph + cells . Taken together , these results suggest that RhoA subfamily GTPases negatively regulate Eph - ephrin reverse endocytosis upon stimulation with soluble EphB2 ectodomains , while they do not have a crucial function in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . Given Discussion 119 the complex nature of the role that RhoA subfamily GTPases play in endocytic processes , further experimentation is required to elucidate the exact molecular mechanism of RhoA function in this context , and at which state of the endocytic process RhoA subfamily members exert their effect . 3 . 3 Polymerisation of actin in Eph ‐ ephrin trans ‐ endocytosis Endocytic processes for the uptake of large cargoes are in most cases dependent on the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton ( Girao et al . 2008 , Doherty & McMahon 2009 ) . Moreover , for ephrinB trans - endocytosis into Eph + cells , the requirement of the actin cytoskeleton has already been demonstrated ( Marston et al . 2003 ) . The work in this study , which implicates the activity of Rac - family GTPases , well - known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytic contexts , in the control of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells indicates that the requirement for actin reorganisation is shared by the forward and reverse pathways . Supporting this hypothesis , recent results from our group directly link actin reorganisation to EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells ( Gaitanos , unpublished data ) . SKN cells over - expressing LifeAct , a small peptide marker that allows the visualisation of F - actin ( Riedl et al . 2008 ) , were co - cultured with HeLa cells expressing EphB2  C - GFP . Live cell - imaging revealed strong co - localisation of polymerised actin with EphB2 - containing clusters at sites of cell contact , as well as during the initial steps of internalisation of clusters including their pinching off from the membrane . Strikingly , co - localisation with polymerised actin is lost rapidly after internalisation ( within 3 min ) . As a control experiment , cells were treated with EHT1864 , which resulted in drastically reduced dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and subsequently no co - localisation of polymerised actin with EphB2 - containing clusters at sites of cell contact . These results indicate that rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is induced by Rac activity and occurs during the early steps of internalisation in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , but is dispensable for further endocytic trafficking . Interestingly , the time scale for Tiam1 and Rac activation downstream of EphA signalling observed by Boissier and co - workers fits very nicely with timing observed in the LifeAct experiments , as they reported a peak in activation 3 - 5 min after stimulation ( Boissier et al . Discussion 120 2013 ) . Even though these results were obtained in a different experimental setup ( forward direction and stimulation with soluble ectodomains ) , it still supports the idea that Tiam - induced Rac activity drives the actin polymerisation observed during the initial steps of Eph - ephrin internalisation . It is difficult to further clarify the precise nature of the interaction of the actin cytoskeleton with the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , because of the limitations in conventional light microscopy regarding spatial resolution . Electron microscopy or similar approaches allowing for a higher resolution are also inadequate for studying such short - lived and transient processes . Therefore , to gain a better understanding of which steps actin is required for during the trans - endocytic process , it would be very insightful to apply live cell imaging with super - resolution techniques . A recent example of the benefits of such an approach is the work by Li and colleagues that provided valuable insights into the molecular interaction of actin with endocytic processes at a resolution not previously attainable ( Li et al . 2015 ) . In summary , the recent discoveries in our group support the central role of actin in the trans - endocytosis process proposed by both previous work and the findings in this study . Recent technological advances might open novel avenues to decipher the exact mechanism of actin contribution to the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes . 3 . 4 Regulation of Eph ‐ ephrin endocytosis by Rho GEFs and GAPs 3 . 4 . 1 Analysing the data from the siRNA screen based on consistency over strength of results yields more accurate candidates In this study I presented two separate ways of analysing the data obtained from the image - based siRNA screen for the function of Rho family GEFs and GAPs in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . Initially , we scored the effect of each siRNA oligo compared to the average of all negative controls from the whole screen . We then selected candidates on the basis of a single oligo showing a strong response in average over the two separate repetitions conducted ( Fig . 16 ) . However , the follow - up analysis of the strongest candidate determined this way , ITSN1 ( Fig . 17 ) , as well as a combination of oligos for different candidate genes to account for potential redundancy ( Fig . 18 ) , could not confirm Discussion 121 the results . In a second approach , we normalised the effect of each oligo not against the combined negative controls from the whole screen , but against the negative controls tested in the same plate in order to account for potential inter - plate variations in the baseline amount of endocytosis observed . Furthermore , we then examined the average from all four separate oligos for each gene to safeguard against potential false positive results derived from outliers or off - target effects of specific single oligos ( Fig . 19 ) . With this approach we identified Tiam2 as the candidate with the strongest effect on EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells and subsequent experiments replicated these results . Moreover , the importance of Tiam2 was also confirmed by additional experiments in HeLa cells ( Fig . 20 ) . The downside of the analysis taking the average over all tested siRNA oligos for a given protein is that it can mask potential effects and lead to false negative results , if some oligos do not result in a sufficient knockdown of the protein of interest . However , as our initial approach relying on single oligos proved unsuccessful in obtaining verifiable candidates , we were willing to accept this limitation . We therefore found , at least for the presented study , basing the analysis of screen data on the consistency of responses to be superior to an analysis based on the size of an effect in single observations . 3 . 4 . 2 Regulation of Eph ‐ ephrin trans ‐ endocytosis by Tiam1 / 2 In this study we found that the Rac activity required for trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes is induced by GEFs of the Tiam family . Already identified as a hit in our image - based siRNA screen , subsequent experiments confirmed the requirement of Tiam2 for efficient EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + SKN and HeLa cells ( Fig . 20 ) . Interestingly , knockdown of Tiam1 did not result in a significant change in the amount of EphB trans - endocytosis into SKN cells , but it showed a comparable effect to Tiam2 knockdown in HeLa cells ( Fig . 20B and C ) . A combined knockdown of the two proteins also reduced trans - endocytosis in HeLa cells , but the effect was no larger than that seen in the single knockdowns . The close similarity between Tiam1 and Tiam2 suggests the possibility of physiological redundancy between the two ( Matsuo et al . 2003 ) . However , if physiological redundancy between Tiam1 and Tiam2 was assumed , one would expect a larger effect in the double knockdown . There are three possible explanations for the Discussion 122 absence of this expected increase in our observations : firstly , the reduced concentration of each specific siRNA oligo used in the combined knockdown could lead to an inefficient ablation of protein expression , and the remaining level of Tiam proteins decreases the observed effect ; or , secondly , Tiam1 and Tiam2 are not physiologically redundant , but are co - operating in regulating trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes in some cellular contexts , but not in others . Finally it is also possible that the expression levels of Tiam1 differ between SKN and HeLa cells and assuming a high expression of Tiam in SKN cells the knockdown with siRNA could not be sufficient Additional experiments in other cell lines , and , especially , in neuronal cells could help clarify the individual contribution of the two Tiam proteins to the endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes . Previous work has established a role for Tiam1 in the regulation of endocytosis into Eph + cells induced by stimulation with soluble ephrin ectodomains ( Yoo et al . 2010 , Boissier et al . 2013 , Um et al . 2014 ) . In agreement with these results , we also show a requirement for Tiam family proteins in ephrinB trans - endocytosis into EphB - expressing HeLa cells ( Fig . 20C ) . An unanswered question is how Eph - ephrin signalling is linked to the Tiam proteins molecularly . Previous work by Tanaka and colleagues has shown that both Tiam1 and Tiam2 bind to ephrinB1 via their N - terminal PH - CC - Ex domain ( Tanaka et al . 2004 ) . The binding and co - localisation with ephrinB1 of Tiam1 is increased after stimulation with soluble EphB2 - Fc fusion proteins and leads to a rise in Rac activity . Evidence for the interaction of Tiam2 with ephrinBs in the context of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells was provided by recent work from our group , which has demonstrated co - localisation of EphB - ephrinB clusters with Tiam2 ( T . Gaitanos , unpublished data ) . However , which protein domains are involved in the potential interaction remains unknown . Overexpression of the Tiam PH - CC - Ex domain alone has shown a dominant negative effect in several studies ( Tanaka et al . 2004 , Tolias et al . 2007 , Terawaki et al . 2010 ) . Thus , overexpressing the Tiam PH - CC - Ex domain in trans - endocytosis experiments could elucidate whether binding via this domain is required for regulation of EphB - ephrinB trans - endocytosis by Tiam family proteins . Furthermore , it will also be valuable to map the exact interaction site within ephrinB molecules , since it might be possible to generate specific point mutations that interrupt Tiam - ephrinB binding . This could potentially result in a Discussion 123 version of ephrinB that is endocytosis - deficient , while unperturbed in its other signalling capabilities , which would be a very valuable tool in dissecting the individual contributions of endocytosis and other signalling mechanisms employed downstream of ephrinBs . While several studies provide evidence for enhancement of Tiam1 activity after tyrosine phosphorylation ( Servitja et al . 2003 , Miyamoto et al . 2006 , Tolias et al . 2007 ) , Tanaka and colleagues found only weak phosphorylation of Tiam1 downstream of ephrinB1 , even though they report a concomitant increase in Rac activity ( Tanaka et al . 2004 ) . In Eph - ephrin forward signalling , Tiam1 is directly phosphorylated by Eph receptors ( Tanaka et al . 2004 , Tolias et al . 2007 , Boissier et al . 2013 ) . Since ephrin ligands lack kinase activity of their own , phosphorylation of Tiam proteins in the reverse direction would require an intermediary kinase . Tiam1 can be phosphorylated by SFKs ( Servitja et al . 2003 ) and SFKs are activated downstream of ephrinBs ( Palmer et al . 2002 , Georgakopoulos et al . 2006 ) . Thus , SFKs are possible candidates to mediate phosphorylation of Tiam1 and Tiam2 downstream of ephrinBs , if phosphorylation is required for their function in regulating EphB - ephrinB endocytosis . Visualising and possibly interfering with the phosphorylation status of Tiam proteins , for example , by immunofluorescence with phospho - specific antibodies , or the transfection of phospho - mimetic or phosphorylation - deficient point mutants of Tiam proteins , would help elucidate the mechanisms of Tiam proteins in Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis . A complimentary approach could clarify whether SFKs are involved by employing siRNA - mediated knockdown or treatment with pharmacological inhibitors . Results from my experiments could not detect a requirement for Tiam1 , Tiam2 , or Rac activity for reverse endocytosis of soluble EphB ectodomains into ephrinB + cells ( Fig . 21 ) . As the experiments by Tanaka and colleagues were also performed with stimulation by soluble EphB2 ectodomains and led to an increase in Rac activity induced by Tiam1 ( Tanaka et al . 2004 ) , these results could be viewed as contradictory to my findings . The two most plausible explanations for these contrasting results would be that either Tiam1 - mediated Rac activity downstream of ephrinBs might serve a purpose other than regulating endocytosis , or it represents a cell type - specific phenomenon . Discussion 124 In summary , our work builds on the existing literature linking Tiam family proteins to Eph - ephrin signalling and firmly establishes their role as regulators of Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis . Further work will be necessary to decipher the exact molecular mechanisms governing the interaction between Tiam proteins and Eph - ephrin complexes in this context . 3 . 4 . 3 The siRNA screen of Rho family GEFs and GAPs has provided further interesting candidates for the regulation of Eph ‐ ephrin trans ‐ endocytosis Our image - based siRNA screen revealed several candidate genes that could regulate EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . In line with our findings that EphB trans - endocytosis requires Rac activity , three out of the four strongest hits that decreased endocytosis upon siRNA knockdown were GEFs that show activity towards Rac ( Tiam2 , Vav1 , Als2 ) . Our follow - up experiments confirmed Tiam2 as a regulator of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells , thus demonstrating the reliability of the results obtained from the screen . As depletion of Tiam proteins does not result in a complete inhibition of Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis , it is possible that other GEFs take over its role in increasing Rac activity and promoting actin polymerisation downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling to some extent . In our screen , among the GEFs whose depletion led to a decrease in trans - endocytosis , Vav1 showed the second strongest result when comparing the average z - scores of all 4 tested siRNA oligos . Vav1 is one of three closely related GEFs making up the Vav family , the other two being Vav2 and Vav3 ( Bustelo 2014 ) . Vav family GEFs exhibit activity towards GTPases from the RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 - like subfamilies , but their catalytic activity is several folds higher towards Rac1 as compared to other GTPases , at least for Vav2 ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) . This is in agreement with the majority of the literature on Vav - family proteins describing the relevance of their signalling through Rac ( Bustelo 2014 ) . The Vav - family GEFs differ in their expression patterns , as Vav2 and Vav3 are expressed ubiquitously , while Vav1 is mainly found in the hematopoietic system in the healthy body and is upregulated during many types of cancer ( Bustelo 2000 , Katzav 2015 ) . Interestingly , Vav family GEFs have previously been implicated in Eph - ephrin signalling and endocytosis ( Cowan et al . 2005 ) . Vav2 interacts with , and is phosphorylated downstream of , EphA receptors and experiments with neuronal cultures from Vav2 / Vav3 double knockout mice demonstrated the requirement of Vav family members for Eph - ephrin Discussion 125 signalling - induced growth cone collapse and the internalisation of Eph - ephrin complexes . However , the requirement for endocytosis was only tested by stimulation with soluble ephrinA ectodomains and not in a cell contact - mediated context . Unfortunately , the study also did not compare results from the double knockout to single knockout of Vav2 and / or Vav3 , so it is not possible to infer whether the two proteins are redundant . In general , evidence for both redundant and non - redundant functions of Vav - family GEFs exists ( Fujikawa et al . 2003 , Pearce et al . 2004 , Bustelo 2014 ) . Knockdown of Vav2 and Vav3 did not result in significant changes to EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells in our screen . A possible explanation for these findings is , of course , the possibility that SKN cells do not express Vav2 or Vav3 . Further evidence for mechanistic redundancy between Vav proteins and Tiam , as could be the case in the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , derives from the work of Servitja and colleagues ( Servitja et al . 2003 ) . They show that both Vav2 and Tiam1 are phosphorylated downstream of c - src and in turn increase Rac activity . While in their study , phosphorylation of either GEF was dependent on the type of stimulation by different pathways , it is conceivable that both could also be activated by a common pathway , and assume the function of each other , especially , in the absence of one of the proteins . Furthermore , the fact that both proteins get phosphorylated by src fits very well in the context of Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis , since SFKs are key signalling mediators in both Eph - ephrin forward and reverse signalling ( Ellis et al . 1996 , Holland et al . 1996 , Zisch et al . 1998 , Davy et al . 1999 , Palmer et al . 2002 ) . Therefore , future experiments , firstly confirming the relevance of Vav family GEFs , and secondly , exploring the possible redundancy between Vav and Tiam family GEFs , for example , by simultaneous siRNA knockdown , could provide valuable information on the molecular mechanisms governing Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis . A third candidate GEF that showed a decrease in trans - endocytosis upon siRNA knockdown is Alsin ( ALS2 ) . Its name derives from its implication in motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) ( Hadano et al . 2001 , Yang et al . 2001 ) . ALS2 contains GEF domains for and binding affinity towards both Rab5 and Rac1 ( Topp et al . 2004 ) . In how far ALS2 actually displays GEF activity towards Rac , however , is still a matter of debate , as studies showing activity towards Rac1 ( Otomo et al . 2008 ) , and those showing no increase in Rac activity resulting from ALS2 overexpression have both been Discussion 126 published ( Topp et al . 2004 , Tudor et al . 2005 ) . Their possible regulatory function in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells is supported by their role in Rac - dependent macropinocytosis and endocytic trafficking , as well as in axonal growth dynamics ( Tudor et al . 2005 , Devon et al . 2006 , Hadano et al . 2007 , Kunita et al . 2007 , Otomo et al . 2008 ) . The discrepancy between the involvement of ALS2 in Rac - dependent macropinocytosis and its lack of catalytic activity towards Rac1 reported in some studies can be resolved by the role of ALS2 suggested in endocytic trafficking . In particular , ALS localises to active Rac1 at macropinocytic sites and mediates the fusion of macropinosomes with early endosomes via its Rab5GEF activity ( Devon et al . 2006 , Kunita et al . 2007 , Otomo et al . 2008 , Otomo et al . 2011 ) . Nonetheless , the fact that another study showed increased Rac and PAK activity stimulated by ALS2 allows for the possibility that ALS2 directly regulates macropinocytosis , at least in some physiological contexts ( Tudor et al . 2005 ) . This idea has been supported by the finding that the function of ALS2 is probably cell - type specific , since macropinocytosis was decreased in ALS2 - deficient neurons , but not fibroblasts ( Otomo et al . 2008 ) . Although the exact contribution of ALS2 to macropinocytosis has not yet been completely unravelled , it represents an interesting candidate for the regulation of Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis . ALS2 could fulfil this role by either acting as an additional , potentially redundant , RacGEF required for the initiation of Rac activity and trans - endocytosis , or by affecting the subsequent trafficking of endosomes . In order to further decipher the precise role of ALS2 in Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis , it would be necessary to confirm the original results of our screen and subsequently dissect out potential redundancies , as already suggested for the Vav family GEFs , by performing simultaneous siRNA knockdowns . Additionally , given its role as a Rab5GEF , and in light of previous work implicating Rab5 in the endocytosis of EphA receptors ( Deininger et al . 2008 ) , further analysis of the contribution of Rab5 to the trans - endocytosis process could prove insightful . Of the four strongest candidates among the GEFs resulting in a decrease of endocytosis , I have so far omitted Active breakpoint cluster region - related protein ( Abr ) from the discussion , although it showed the third strongest effect when z - scores were averaged over all 4 tested oligos . Abr is a complex protein containing both a GAP and a GEF domain ( Tan et al . 1993 ) and the literature on the specificity and relevance of the GEF and GAP Discussion 127 domains of Abr is very contradictory . Initial reports showed a broad specificity for the GEF domain with activity towards Cdc42 , RhoA , and Rac subfamily members with highest catalytic activity on Cdc42 , whereas GAP activity was limited to Cdc42 and the Rac subfamily GTPases ( Chuang et al . 1995 ) . In contradiction to these observations a later study , systematically analysing Rho family GEFs , found no catalytic GEF activity of Abr in vitro ( Jaiswal et al . 2013a ) . In the more physiological context of single cell wound healing , however , Abr increases RhoA activity , suggesting that Abr is an active GEF ( Vaughan et al . 2011 ) . In contrast , GAP activity on Rac and / or Cdc42 has been well documented by several independent studies ( Cho et al . 2007 , Oh et al . 2010 , Vaughan et al . 2011 ) . Additionally , Abr shares high sequence similarity with Bcr ( Chuang et al . 1995 ) , another GEF and GAP domain - containing protein recently described to be important in Eph - ephrin signalling in the context of synapse development ( Um et al . 2014 ) . Abr and Bcr have both overlapping and distinct signalling functions ( Cho et al . 2007 , Cunnick et al . 2009 ) , and many studies of their physiological function use mice deficient for both proteins ( Cho et al . 2007 , Cunnick et al . 2009 , Um et al . 2014 ) . Expression of a GAP - deficient Bcr variant and experiments with Bcr and Abr double deficient cells resulted in an increase in endocytosis of Eph stimulated by soluble ephrin ectodomains in the work by Um and colleagues ( Um et al . 2014 ) . These results are in disagreement to our findings of a decrease in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells upon knockdown of Abr . However , these differences could derive from the quite varied GEF activities reported for Abr and might be cell - type specific . While we did not follow - up on the possible relevance of Abr in this study , future experiments analysing the role of Abr and possibly also Bcr in Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis could prove very informative , but will have to address carefully the respective contribution of its GEF and GAP functions . So far , I have mainly discussed candidates from the screen containing GEF domains and neglected the candidate proteins for regulation of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells among the GAPs . Apart from Abr , which is discussed above , the depletion of two GAPs resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of internalised Eph - ephrin complexes : Human Minor Histocompatibility Antigen1 ( HMHA1 ) and Phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase regulatory subunit beta ( PIK3R2 ) . HMHA1 has only recently been shown to exhibit broad GAP activity towards RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 in Discussion 128 vitro , and to decrease RhoA and , especially , Rac1 activity resulting in changes in actin dynamics in mammalian cell lines ( de Kreuk et al . 2013 ) . There are no reports about the GAP activity of PIK3R2 to date . PIK3R1 , a very close homologue , however , displays GAP activity towards Rab5 , as well as towards Rac and Cdc42 , but to the Rho GTPases only at a lesser extent and only in vitro ( Chamberlain et al . 2004 , Runyan et al . 2012 ) . These studies demonstrated that PIK3R1 modulates endocytic trafficking via the interaction with Rab5 . Interestingly , a large scale proteomic screen conducted very recently revealed an interaction between ephrinB2 and PIK3R2 ( Huttlin et al . 2015 ) . In light of this finding , PIK3R2 constitutes a valid candidate for further follow - up analysis . Our screen also identified a candidate GEF ( Net1 ) and a candidate GAP ( OPHN1 ) , whose depletion resulted in an increase in EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells . As we were lacking a reliable positive control leading to an increase in endocytosis , we were not certain which magnitudes of effect to expect , which complicated evaluation of the screen data . Furthermore , the fact that Net1 is a GEF specific for RhoA subfamily GTPases ( Alberts & Treisman 1998 ) , while OPHN1 , although it shows a broad tuning of GAP activity in vitro ( Billuart et al . 1998 ) , mediates its physiological function via inhibition of RhoA signalling ( Govek et al . 2004 , Khelfaoui et al . 2009 ) , appears contradictory , as this suggests they should have opposing functions . In one of these studies it was also specifically proposed that the GAP activity of OPHN1 counteracts the inhibitory effect on endocytosis enacted by RhoA signalling ( Khelfaoui et al . 2009 ) , which would imply that siRNA knockdown of OPHN1 leads to a decrease of endocytosis instead of the observed increase . In light of these conflicting results , and the difficulties in evaluating candidates resulting in an increase of endocytosis , we focussed our follow - up analysis first on proteins whose depletion resulted in a decrease of endocytosis . Nonetheless , future work on the mentioned candidates could explain the contradicting result of a RhoA - specific GEF and GAP showing the same effect , and improve our understanding of the regulation of Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis . We focussed our follow - up analysis to a single candidate , Tiam2 , which we successfully confirmed as a key regulator of Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis . With this proof - of - principle validating our screen approach , it stands to reason that analysis of the other candidate proteins found in the screen will advance our understanding of the regulation of Eph - ephrin Discussion 129 trans - endocytosis and potentially also reveal redundancy or cross - talk between different Rho GTPase - regulating proteins . 3 . 5 Physiological role of Eph ‐ ephrin endocytosis 3 . 5 . 1 Trafficking of Eph ‐ ephrin complexes and the “signalling endosome” hypothesis The discovery that Eph receptors remain phosphorylated after internalisation allows for the possibility of sustained Eph - ephrin signalling from the endosomal compartment ( Marston et al . 2003 ) . The idea of “signalling endosomes” derives from original work with EGFRs , which has proven that the signalling machinery stays attached to EGFRs on endosomes and that continued signalling from endosomal compartments is crucial for effective EGF signalling ( Di Guglielmo et al . 1994 , Bergeron et al . 1995 , Burke et al . 2001 ) . Several other cell surface receptors have since been shown to exhibit continued signalling after internalisation , including neurotrophic factor receptors TrkA , TrkB and p75NTR , as well as the NoGo receptor ( Grimes et al . 1996 , Heerssen et al . 2004 , Saxena et al . 2005 , Joset et al . 2010 ) . Not only does signalling from endosomes extend signalling responses from cell surface receptors , but it can also serve to localise signalling by trafficking of endosomes to specific cellular locations , such as in the vicinity of the cell membrane for Rac1 during cell migration ( Palamidessi et al . 2008 ) , or to the nucleus for changes in transcription by retrograde transport of neurotrophic factor receptors ( Riccio et al . 1997 ) . In several described cases , the formation of signalling endosomes has been linked to macropinocytosis - like endocytic events that are regulated by Rac ( Valdez et al . 2007 , Joset et al . 2010 ) . Additionally , membrane scission for the formation of signalling endosomes can be controlled by the ATPase Pincher and not by dynamin as in many other endocytic processes ( Shao et al . 2002 , Joset et al . 2010 ) . However , whether this is a general rule , and whether dynamin might not still be involved in the formation of some signalling endosomes , is still a matter of debate ( Winckler & Yap 2011 ) . As Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis seems to resemble at least some aspects of the endocytic process described in these works and also requires Rac activity , it would be interesting to investigate whether the pathways are the same . Experiments with a dominant negative version of Pincher , as Discussion 130 described by Shao and colleagues ( Shao et al . 2002 ) , or , alternatively , knockdown with siRNA in an Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis assay could shed some light on this question . After the initial finding that Eph receptors remain phosphorylated after internalisation ( Marston et al . 2003 ) , work by Boissier and colleagues expanded on the notion that Eph - ephrin signalling could continue after endocytosis ( Boissier et al . 2013 ) . In their experiments with EphA2 - expressing cells stimulated with soluble ephrinA1 ectodomains they observed association of Tiam1 with activated EphA2 after internalisation and concluded that this was evidence for Eph - ephrin signalling through Tiam1 and Rac from the endosomal compartment . Closer examination of their data , however , suggests that since peak activity of Tiam1 and Rac after stimulation with ephrinA1 occurred during the earliest observed time points , these findings only confirm the importance of Tiam - induced Rac activity in the endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes and are not necessarily substantial evidence for signalling from endosomes . Nonetheless , while the evidence presented in the study by Boissier and colleagues does not provide conclusive evidence for Eph - ephrin signalling from the endosomal compartment , it would be sensible to expand on their work and test whether interference with endosomal trafficking affects the signalling . Another unanswered question is in how far there is also the potential for signalling from the endosomal compartment in the reverse direction . EphrinBs have been shown to be de - phosphorylated shortly after their activation and could thus lose their signalling capacity by the time they arrive in endosomal compartments ( Palmer et al . 2002 ) . On the other hand , several features of ephrinB reverse signalling are independent of tyrosine phosphorylation , for example , the interaction with PDZ - binding proteins ( Bruckner et al . 1999 , Makinen et al . 2005 ) . Hence , also the reverse direction of Eph - ephrin endocytosis merits investigation into whether signalling from endosomes takes place . A first step could be the extraction of endosomes followed by biochemical analysis of binding partners of Eph - ephrin clusters analogously to the work by Boissier and colleagues for the forward direction ( Boissier et al . 2013 ) . Continued signalling from endosomal compartments only presents one possibility for the fate of Eph - ephrin complexes after internalisation . The two further alternative trafficking pathways , which are not necessarily mutually exclusive of continued signalling , are degradation and recycling back to the plasma membrane . Work by Boissier and colleagues Discussion 131 also quantified the relative amount of Eph - ephrin complexes routed toward degradation in lysosomes ( two thirds ) and recycled to the plasma membrane ( one third ) ( Boissier et al . 2013 ) . Several other studies also described the trafficking of Eph receptors into lysosomes , which was reported to be dependent on their ubiquitination by Cbl ( Walker - Daniels et al . 2002 , Sharfe et al . 2003 , Fasen et al . 2008 , Sabet et al . 2015 ) . Unfortunately , these studies were performed solely using stimulation with soluble ephrin ectodomains and only focussed on the forward direction . Since there are very distinct downstream signalling patterns between forward and reverse direction , as well as cell - contact or soluble protein - induced signalling ( Jorgensen et al . 2009 ) , and since this study has further expanded on some of these differences in the context of endocytosis , it is not obvious , whether the same endocytic fate is shared between Eph - ephrin complexes in these distinct scenarios . Further work unravelling the endocytic fate of Eph - ephrin complexes is therefore needed . One possible approach in this context would be studying the role of Rab family GTPases downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling . 3 . 5 . 2 Endocytosis and growth cone collapse One pivotal role of Eph - ephrin signalling is its function in axon guidance during neuronal development . In contexts ranging from retinotopic map formation to midline guidance in spinal projections of the motor system , Eph - ephrin signalling provides repulsive guidance cues crucial for the correct development of the nervous system ( see also section 1 . 1 . 3 ) . The repulsive signal mediated by the Eph - ephrin interaction originates from the induction of growth cone collapse , which allows the axon to re - sprout and continue growing in a different direction ( Yu & Bargmann 2001 , Egea & Klein 2007 ) . Since the interaction between Ephs and ephrins initially leads to high affinity adhesion between the two cells in contact , Eph - ephrin complexes must be removed from the cell surface to allow cell detachment to occur . Trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes enables cell detachment as a general mechanism and is particularly relevant in the context of growth cone collapse ( Marston et al . 2003 , Zimmer et al . 2003 ) . The endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes required for efficient growth cone collapse has been shown to be governed by Rac , at least for signalling in the forward direction ( Marston et al . 2003 , Cowan et al . 2005 ) . Additionally , the growth cone collapse response downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling in Discussion 132 both directions requires the activity of RhoA ( Wahl et al . 2000 , Sahin et al . 2005 , Takeuchi et al . 2015 ) . This differential requirement of both Rac and RhoA for growth cone collapse is interesting given that the two GTPases often fulfil contrasting physiological functions and their signalling pathways can inhibit each other ( Guilluy et al . 2011 ) . Here , we show that EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells also requires Rac activity and that this mechanism is also employed by neurons ( Fig . 10 ) . Apart from its role in regulating the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , Rac1 activity downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling has also been shown to induce endocytosis of large patches of the plasma membrane , which is required for growth cone collapse in addition to the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton ( Jurney et al . 2002 ) . The question now arises of how the Rac - mediated regulation of endocytic processes by Eph - ephrin signalling is related to the requirement of RhoA activity in Eph - ephrin - induced growth cone collapse . The data presented in this thesis combined with findings from the extensive literature on Eph - ephrin signalling in growth cone collapse allow for the following model integrating the separate elements . Growth cone collapse induced by Eph - ephrin signalling consists of two or three distinct steps differentially regulated by Rho GTPases . To allow the cell detachment necessary for growth cone collapse , Eph - ephrin complexes need to be internalised , a process that is controlled by Rac activity . Additionally , Rac activity downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling also leads to the endocytosis of plasma membrane patches , reducing the surface of the growth cone . The third step is disassembly of the filamentous actin structures making up the cytoskeleton , which is orchestrated by Eph - ephrin signalling - induced RhoA activity . Possibly , the activation of RhoA can occur from Eph - ephrin complexes residing in endosomal compartments , and these signalling endosomes could control locally restricted RhoA activity , in a similar fashion to what has been reported for Rac signalling from endosomes in cell migration ( Palamidessi et al . 2008 ) . This hypothesis for the spatio - temporal control of actin reorganisation requiring a shift from Rac signalling to a RhoA - based signalling response could be mediated by proteins already implicated in Eph - ephrin induced growth cone collapse . The GEF ephexin is phosphorylated by Eph receptors , which changes its specificity by increasing activity towards RhoA , while decreasing its activity towards Rac and Cdc42 ( Shamah et al . 2001 , Sahin et al . 2005 ) . Thus , it represents a valid candidate to Discussion 133 mediate a shift from Rac - induced endocytosis to RhoA - induced actin disassembly in the course of growth cone collapse . A second GTPase regulating protein shown to be important for growth cone collapse and axon guidance downstream of EphA4 signalling is the RacGAP  chimaerin ( Beg et al . 2007 , Wegmeyer et al . 2007 ) . Since it localises to activated Eph receptors , it could potentially mediate a down - regulation of Rac activity after its initial requirement for the endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes . The down - regulation of Rac activity then in turn could lead to a disinhibition of RhoA signalling ( Guilluy et al . 2011 ) . Another possibility for switching signalling properties has been described for ephrinB reverse signalling . Here recruitment of SFK to activated Eph - ephrin clusters first leads to phosphorylation - dependent signalling events , while subsequent dephosphorylation by PTP - BL switches the response to PDZ - dependent signalling ( Palmer et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , a study of the role of Eph - ephrin signalling in dendritic spine development and synapse formation has shown an example where tight regulation of Rac activity by a complex consisting of Tiam1 and Bcr , a Rac - specific GEF and GAP respectively , is required to mediate Eph - ephrin function ( Um et al . 2014 ) . A very similar model has been proposed for the regulation of repulsive axon guidance by the NoGo receptor ( Joset et al . 2010 ) . Also in this case , endocytosis of activated receptors requires Rac activity and the induction of growth cone collapse depends on both endocytosis of the receptors and localised activation of RhoA signalling from NoGo receptors in the endosomal compartment . This proposed model for sequential activation of Rac and Rho subfamily GTPases by Eph - ephrin complexes in mediating growth cone collapse in a multi - step process requiring localised signalling from endosomes is , of course , at this point still highly speculative , although it is solidly grounded in the findings of this thesis and the existing literature . Providing evidence for this model being physiologically relevant will be challenging , since the overlapping roles and functions of Rho family GTPases and their regulators are difficult to decipher . In order to gain further insights into the precise spatio - temporal regulation of and the cross - talk between Rho family GTPases downstream of Eph - ephrin signalling , experimental approaches suited to both visualise and perturb Rho GTPase activity at a very high spatio - temporal resolution are required . The challenges of achieving this level of Discussion 134 understanding of Rho GTPase signalling networks are summarised in an informative commentary ( Pertz 2010 ) . One way to overcome the challenge of affecting several physiological processes simultaneously due to interference with Rho GTPase activity is to target regulating proteins specific for the function of interest . By identifying a Rac - specific GEF , Tiam2 , to be required for Eph - ephrin trans - endocytosis this study provides one candidate for such specific regulation . 3 . 6 Conclusion and Outlook The presented thesis puts forward the first comprehensive analysis of the regulation of EphB trans - endocytosis into ephrinB + cells by Rho family GTPases . We describe an endocytic pathway that is regulated by Rac subfamily GTPases and their activation by GEFs of the Tiam family , which requires reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton . Tiam - induced Rac activity is also required for ephrinB trans - endocytosis into EphB + cells . The physiological relevance of this pathway is underlined by the observation that cortical neurons require the same molecular regulation for EphB trans - endocytosis . While the forward endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes induced by soluble ephrins ectodomains probably uses the same endocytic machinery as the trans - endocytosis observed upon cell - cell contact , reverse endocytosis triggered by soluble EphB ectodomains uses a different mechanism that is affected by the activity of RhoA , but not Rac subfamily GTPases . The distinct molecular pathways employed between EphB trans - endocytosis after cell contact and reverse endocytosis after stimulation with soluble EphB ectodomains , indicates that future investigations into the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes should be conducted in settings that replicate the contact between Eph - and ephrin - expressing cells in order to remain as close as possible to the relevant physiological processes . The results of the siRNA screen could still be further exploited . Since the follow - up analysis of the strongest candidate , Tiam2 , confirmed its significance in the regulation of the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , it is plausible to assume that further investigations based on the results of the screen will yield additional insights into the molecular regulation of Eph - ephrin endocytosis . Discussion 135 One goal for the analysis of Eph - ephrin signalling is the uncoupling of the endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes from other downstream signalling events . One challenge that must be overcome is the fact that both the trans - endocytosis of Eph - ephrin complexes , as well as the cellular responses traditionally associated with many physiological functions of Eph - ephrin signalling , such as growth cone collapse or cell rounding , require reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton . Therefore the use of experimental techniques allowing for very tight spatio - temporal manipulation and analysis would be prudent . Approaching this challenge on the levels of the specific GEFs identified in this study might prove beneficial , as compared to approaches affecting , for example , the actin cytoskeleton as a whole or the Rho family GTPases themselves , since they are bound to have a more wide - spread physiological effect . Taking all of this into consideration , this study represents a valuable expansion of our knowledge of the Eph - ephrin signalling system by describing a molecular regulatory mechanism of Eph - ephrin endocytosis , which is relevant in physiological contexts . Additionally , it provides a solid foundation for further analysis of the endocytic processes in the Eph - ephrin system and their contribution to signalling responses . Further unravelling these mechanisms will greatly benefit our understanding of the Eph - ephrin system and its many important functions during development and diseases processes .

Experiments with HeLa cells on coverslips were imaged with a 63x oil immersion objective . 4 . 2 . 7 Endocytosis assay with soluble Eph or ephrin ectodomains SKN - H2B - RFP cells or HeLa cells were cultured in 96 - well plates ( Greiner Bio One GmbH , Frickenhausen , Germany ) or on cover slips in 6 - well plates in OptiMEM or DMEM complemented as above at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . HeLa cells were transfected with either EphB2 - mCherry ( for forward direction experiments ) or ephrinB1 - mcherry ( for reverse direction experiments ) as described above . Cells were starved in serum - free OptiMEM overnight before stimulation . Fusion proteins of the ectodomain of either EphB2 ( for Materials and Methods 143 reverse direction experiments ) or ephrinB2 ( for forward direction experiments ) fused to human Fc ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , United States ) were pre - clustered with dylight488 dye - coupled anti - Fc antibodies ( Jackson Immunoresearch ) in volume ratio 5 : 1 for 45 min at room temperature . Human IgG - Fc ( Jackson Immunoresearch ) was used as a negative control and prepared in the same fashion . Cells were incubated with the clustered proteins at a final concentration of 2 µg / ml for 30 min at 37 °C . Cells were then fixed immediately on ice with 4 % PFA ( complemented with 4 % sucrose ) . 3 washing steps with PBS were followed by blocking with 3 % Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) ( Sigma Aldrich ) for 30 min at room temperature . Staining for surface clusters was performed with a 1 : 1000 dilution of dyLight649 anti - human Fc antibodies ( Jackson Immunoresearch ) in 3 % BSA at room temperature . HeLa cells were furthermore permeabilised with 0 . 1 % Triton in PBS for 5 min and stained with CellMask TM Blue ( 1 : 2000 ) and DAPI ( 1 : 5000 ) dissolved in PBS for 10 min . Afterwards cells were washed three times with PBS and , in case of experiments on cover slips , mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Life Technologies ) and stored in the dark at 4 °C until imaging . Imaging of SKN experiments in 96 - well plates was performed with a 40x air objective . For each well 10 - 20 positions were selected and stacks of 8 planes with 1 µm step size were taken . Experiments with HeLa cells on coverslips were imaged with a 63x oil immersion objective . For each cover slip 10 - 20 positions were selected and stacks of 15 planes with 0 . 5 µm as step size were taken . Image analysis is described below . 4 . 2 . 8 Assay to determine cell surface expression of ephrinBs The assay was adapted from that above . SKN cells in 96 - well plates were stimulated with EphB2 - Fc , which had been pre - clustered with a dylight488 - coupled antibody for 45 min at room temperature . In contrast to the endocytosis assay , stimulation took place at room temperature for only 2 min before cells were transferred to ice to prevent internalisation . Subsequent staining and image acquisition was performed as above . 4 . 2 . 9 Trans ‐ endocytosis assay SKN - H2B - RFP cells or HeLa cells transfected with either EphB2 - mCherry ( for forward direction experiments ) or ephrinB1 - mCherry ( for reverse direction experiments ) as Materials and Methods 144 described above , were used as acceptor cells . SKN cells were cultured in 96 - well plates ( Greiner Bio One ) in OptiMEM , while HeLa cells were cultured on cover slips in 6 - well plates in DMEM . HeLa cells stably expressing EphB2  C - GFP or HeLa cells transiently transfected with either EphB2  C - GFP ( for reverse direction experiments ) or ephrinB1  C - GFP ( for forward direction experiments ) were used as donor cells . Acceptor cells were starved in serum - free OptiMEM overnight before stimulation . Donor cells were gently dissociated from the surface of the cell culture dish by treatment with 2 mM EDTA in PBS . Donor cells were seeded on top of acceptor cells and incubation for 80 min at 37 °C allowed for trans - endocytosis to occur . Cells were fixed with ice cold 4 % PFA , 4 % sucrose for 15 min , before 3 washes with PBS and blocking with 3 % BSA in PBS for 30 min at RT . Staining for surface clusters was performed with a 1 : 1000 dilution of anti - FLAG antibodies in 3 % BSA at room temperature for 1 h . After 3 washes with PBS FLAG signal was detected with dylight649 - coupled secondary anti - rabbit antibodies for 1 h at RT . HeLa cells were additionally permeabilised with 0 . 1 % Triton in PBS for 5 min and stained with CellMask TM Blue ( 1 : 2000 ) and DAPI ( 1 : 5000 ) dissolved in PBS for 10 min . Cells were then washed three times with PBS and , in case of experiments on cover slips , mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Life Technologies ) . Experiments were stored in the dark at 4°C until imaging . Imaging of SKN experiments in 96 - well plates was performed with a 40x air objective . For each well 10 - 20 positions were selected and stacks of 8 planes with 1 µm step size were taken . Experiments with HeLa cells on coverslips were imaged with a 63x oil immersion objective . For each cover slip 10 - 20 positions were selected and stacks of 15 planes with 0 . 5 µm as step size were taken . Image analysis is described below . 4 . 2 . 10 Image ‐ based siRNA screen of Rho GEFs and GAPs A list of all human proteins containing either a Dbl - homology or DOCK homology domain ( GEFs ) , as well as those containing a RhoGAP domain ( GAPs ) was generated by bioinformatic analysis of the UniProt database ( www . uniprot . org ) . For every gene a set of four separate siRNA oligonucleotides with non - overlapping sequences was purchased . siRNA was applied to SKN cells in 96 - well plates as described above . Each unique oligo was tested in a separate well and the whole set of experiments was repeated once . The trans - endocytosis assay was performed as described above and image acquisition and Materials and Methods 145 analysis with CellProfiler TM software is detailed below . From the resulting quantification of the number of internalised clusters per cell several cut - offs representing a minimum number of internalised clusters were calculated . Subsequently , the percentage of cells containing more than the given number of internalised cluster was calculated for each cut - off and each treatment . Then the cut - off for which the negative scramble control was closest to a value of 40 % cells above cut - off was taken for further analysis . From these values z - scores were calculated by subtracting the average control value from the observed value and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the controls . The average of the controls was either calculated from all values of the entire screen or only from the controls of a specific plate . Genes were ranked according to their z - scores and candidates identified by either examining results for single oligos or by calculating the average over the z - scores for all 4 oligos . 4 . 2 . 11 Trans ‐ endocytosis assay with primary cortical neurons Primary dissociated cultures of cortical neurons were generated from E 15 . 5 mouse embryos of wild type CD1 mice . On the day of the experiment mice were sacrificed and embryos transferred into PBS on ice . Brains were removed , followed by microdissection of the cortices in dissection medium on ice . Cortices from several embryos were dissociated in trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min , followed by further mechanical dissociation . Neurons were seeded into 8 - well imaging chambers ( Ibidi , Planegg , Germany ) coated with Poly - D - lysin ( 1 mg / ml ) and laminin ( 5 µg / ml ) at 10 5 cells / well and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Neurons were stained with 1 µM CellTracker Green in in serum free Neurobasal medium for 30 min . Staining solution was then aspirated and replaced by neuronal maintenance medium . Subsequently , EHT1864 diluted in H 2 O was added to the medium to produce final concentrations of either 2 . 5 µM , 5 µM or 10 µM . The control wells were treated with a volume of H 2 O equal to the one used for the 10 µM EHT1864 treatment . Neurons were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 for 4 h before being transferred to a microscope equipped with a temperature - controlled CO 2 incubation chamber ( Pecon / VisiTron systems ) . After acclimatisation to the imaging chamber HeLa cells over - expressing EphB2  C - mCherry were seeded on top of the cortical neurons at 2x10 4 cells / well . HeLa cells were allowed to settle for several minutes before imaging . Imaging Materials and Methods 146 was performed with a 40x air objective and images of a single focal plane with brightfleld illumination , as well as illumination with the 488 nm ( CellTracker Green in neurons ) and 561 nm ( EphB2  C - mCherry ) lasers were taken at each position at three minute intervals for a total duration of 3 h . Experiments were analysed with MetaMorph TM ( Molecular Devices ) software . Contact points between neurons and HeLa cell over - expressing EphB2  C - mCherry were identified and subsequently scored for whether internalisation occurred or not . For being scored an internalised cluster had to be visible within in the neuron and properly detached from any protrusions of the HeLa cell for at least three consecutive frames 4 . 2 . 12 Image analysis with CellProfiler TM All endocytosis experiments performed in SKN cells were analyses with CellProfiler TM software ( Carpenter et al . 2006 ) . The pipeline for analysing trans - endocytosis experiments is depicted in Figure 23 and the key steps are shown with example images . First , maximum projection images of the image stacks for the three separate channels are loaded . The 561 nm channel contained the signal from the H2B - RFP labelled SKN nuclei , the 488 nm channel contained the signal from the total EphB2DC - GFP , and the 641 nm channel contained the signal from the anti - FLAG staining for visualising surface EphB2 receptors . Images were first corrected for differences in background illumination signal by subtracting a blank image - taken with the same imaging setup - from the image of interest and then thresholded to further reduce signal noise . From the 561 nm channel the software identified the outlines of the SKN nuclei . In the next step the boundaries of the nuclei were expanded by 50 pixels to get an estimate of individual SKN cells ( acceptor cells ) . The outline of the HeLa cell was identified from the 488 nm channel ( donor cell ) . To exclude SKN cells from the analysis that were too far from the HeLa cells to experience cell contact - induced trans - endocytosis , only SKN cells in the vicinity of the HeLa cells were retained . These SKN cells were then used as a mask for the identification of total EphB2  C clusters . Subsequently , the total EphB2  C clusters were used as a mask for the identification of surface clusters in the 641 nm channel . For each cell and cluster identified the software measured several features including size and shape . Furthermore the clusters were also related to which SKN cell they had been identified in . The number of identified Materials and Methods 147 cluster for each cell was then displayed on an image of the cell outlines . Additionally , all data on the identified objects was exported to excel files for subsequent analysis . Analysis of experiments with soluble EphB ectodomains was performed with a similar pipeline . Instead of identifying the donor cells and restricting analysis to SKN acceptor cells in the vicinity , all SKN cells are identified and taken as a mask to then identify total and surface clusters . 4 . 2 . 13 Analysis of experiments with HeLa cells in ImageJ Images from endocytosis experiments in HeLa cells were deconvolved with MetaMorph TM ( Molecular Devices ) software . Subsequent analysis was performed manually in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . 2012 ) on blinded images . Overlay images of the maximum projections of image stacks for the three channels of total EphB2 ( or ephrinB2 respectively ) , surface staining and CellMask Blue / DAPI were generated . Internalised vesicles were identified as clusters devoid of surface staining within a cell . Figure 23 . Analysis of trans ‐ endocytosis assay with CellProfilerTM The image on the left shows an overview of all steps in the CellProfiler TM pipeline . Important steps are highlighted with red boxes and depicted by images on the right . The input images consist of three channels : SKN ‐ H2B ‐ RFP makes up the blue channel , total EphB2  C ‐ GFP signal the green channel and surface EphB2  C ‐ GFP detected by anti ‐ FLAG staining the red channel . The example image on the top shows an overlay with all three channels merged . For subsequent analysis both the outline of the HeLa cell ( 1 ) and the outline of the SKN nuclei ( 2 ) are detected . For the subsequent analysis only the SKN cells ( coloured objects ) in the vicinity of the HeLa cell ( green outline ) are taken into account ( 3 ) . In those selected SKN cells the total EphB2  C ‐ GFP clusters are identified ( 4 ) . Surface clusters are identified from the total clusters that also show co ‐ localising signal in the red channel ( 5 ) . The respective number of both total and surface clusters can then be displayed on each cell ( 6 ) . Materials and Methods 148 4 . 2 . 14 Statistical analysis Data were analysed using Prism ( GraphPad ) software . Data are shown as average of the mean + / - standard error of the mean ( SEM ) unless stated otherwise . Statistical significance was tested for with ANOVA and Dunnett’s post hoc test or with repeated measures ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test where appropriate . Significance levels are denoted with asterisks ( P < 0 . 05 = * , P < 0 . 01 = * * , P < 0 . 005 = * * * ) . Bibliography 149 5 Bibliography Abe , T . , M . Kato , H . Miki , T . Takenawa and T .

Appendix Acknowledgements First and foremost I have to thank my parents for their unconditional love , constant support and all the freedoms they granted me to pursue my dreams . I am also deeply grateful to Angelika Maier for her support , her patience , her understanding , and for never failing to put a smile on my face . I want to thank my supervisor , Prof . Rüdiger Klein , for giving me the opportunity to work in a great lab . I am grateful for all the help in seeing the project through its ups and downs with valuable advice and support . This work would not have been possible without Thomas Gaitanos , who took me on as his padawan and made it his task to show me the ropes of cell biology . He was responsible for teaching me an enormous share of the new things I learned during my PhD and was always there to answer any question I could come up with . I have been truly lucky to share this project with him , as he has not only been a great mentor , but also a true friend . Furthermore , I would like to thank the members of my Thesis Committee , Dr . Ilona Kadow and Prof . Stephan Kröger , for their encouragement and valuable discussions . A valuable resource , not only for discussions in our subgroup meetings , but also for sharing reagents and constructs has been Dr . Jingyi Gong , and I am very grateful for all her help . In dealing with the screen data we received support and ideas from Dr . Christian Kuffer and I would like to thank him for his contributions . I would also like to thank the members of the Klein lab , who taught me to finally do some neurobiology , especially Katharina . I sincerely appreciate all the help and support by the technicians of the Klein lab . Louise , Jana , Pilar and Gönül have made life so much easier by always knowing where to find things and making sure we are always well stocked . I would like to acknowledge all present and former members of the Klein lab that have made my time at the institute so thoroughly enjoyable . Special thanks to Pontus for always being up for some powder action , to Louise for providing good humour and a lot of culinary Appendix delicacies over the years , to Sonia for being so passionate , to Graziana for being always right apart from when playing QuizClash , to Marion for bringing some French flair to the lab , to Annelies for being the Hulk , and to Dani for being a constant source of random science and non - science facts . I have thoroughly enjoyed being a member of the Graduate School of Systemic Neurosciences and would like to express my appreciation for making the PhD time ever so more enjoyable by providing insightful courses , excursions and opportunities to socialise with a very talented and interesting group of young people . I also want to thank the PhD community of the MPI Neurobiology for a lot of memorable experiences . I would like to also thank the mountains of the Alps , the weather gods , my trusted Nat and all people joining on early morning trips into the snow for allowing me to put things into perspective during a good powder run . Furthermore I would like to thank the moody diva from the river Main for providing a constant source of stress and those few magic moments , especially , those days in Israel . A group of people have been very influential for me in forming my decision to pursue not only an education in biomedical sciences , but also focus on the molecular working of the most fascinating of organs : the brain . I would therefore like to thank Dr . Gerhard Neuhäusel , Dr Joachim Altschmied , Prof . Martin Heisenberg , Prof . Stephan Sigrist , Dr . David Owald and Prof . Gero Miesenböck for setting me on the right path . Last , but certainly not least , a very large thank you to Thomas and Louise Gaitanos for their invaluable support in critically ( and rapidly ) reading my thesis and discussing the finer notions of English grammar with me .
