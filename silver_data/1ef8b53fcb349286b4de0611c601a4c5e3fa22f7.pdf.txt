Box 30 , 33 500 Tampere , Finland Accepted 17 March 2008 Abstract Total variation in any measured variable , in conjunction with expected treatment effect , deﬁnes the minimum sample size ( minSS ) required to detect the expected effect with statistical conﬁdence should the effect truly exist . A comprehensive literature survey of 3472 original studies was carried out to identify studies with biomechanical testing of whole bones . Total variation in common biomechanical traits and expected treatment effects in typical interventions were statistically determined . According to this survey , total variation in biomechanical traits between different species of experimental animals was similar , justifying the use of rat femur as a model in further analyses . Due to poorer precision , stiffness and energy absorption assessment require substantially larger sample size than breaking load . Due to same reason , minSS for femoral neck compression test is considerably larger than for femoral shaft three - point bending test . For the bending test , minSS to show a 10 % treatment effect in the breaking load with 80 % statistical power is 11rats / group , while corresponding minSS is 23 for the stiffness , and 53 for the energy absorption . For the femoral neck compression test , minSSs are 16 , 51 , and 134 rats / group , respectively . Among the reviewed studies , the mean sample size was 11animals / group . This underscores the need for considerably larger sample sizes in experimental bone interventions which employ mechanical traits as primary outcome variables . In particular , poor precision and generally small expected treatment effects compromise the utility of stiffness and energy absorption assessments in experimental bone interventions . r 2008 Elsevier Ltd .

Introduction Skeleton has primarily evolved to allow efﬁcient locomotion ( Burr , 1997 ; Frost , 1997 ; Parﬁtt , 1998 ) , and accordingly , bone mechanical competence depicts its ultimate phenotype ( Jarvinen et al . , 2005 ; van der Meulen et al . , 2001 ) . Biomechanical testing provides a direct method to study mechanical traits of bones among various experimental animals with different testing protocols ( Andreassen and Oxlund , 2000 ; Cullinane et al . , 2002 ; Fleming et al . , 2000 ; Ikeda et al . , 2003 ; Jerome et al . , 1999 ; Judex and Zernicke , 2000 ; Klein et al . , 2001 , 2003 ; Les et al . , 2002 ; Luppen et al . , 2002 ) . Besides careful technical execution ( Turner and Burr , 1993 ) , general utility of biomechanical testing relies on its precision . Precision is consistently required for studies using bone densitometry , but this is not the case for biomechanical testing of bones . Obviously , precision , in the stringent sense , cannot be determined because of destructive nature of the method . However , precision can be reasonably assessed from within - pair variation in biomechanical and structural traits of bone ( Eckstein et al . , 2004 ; Jamsa et al . , 1998 ; Jarvinen et al . , 1998b ; Leppanen et al . , 2006 ; Peng et al . , 1994 ) . Total variation observed in any trait reﬂects both biological variation and methodological variation . Preci - sion of the method affects thus the statistical power of the study ; i . e . , the probability that the study could detect the ARTICLE IN PRESS www . elsevier . com / locate / jbiomech www .

For obvious scientiﬁc and ethical reasons , the sample size should be planned carefully before starting any experiment ( Eisman , 2006 ) , so that the number of animals / group is large enough to provide adequate statistical power . This is crucial as underpowered studies can seldom address any research question mean - ingfully , but only lead to inconclusive results ( Ioannidis , 2005 ) . Detectable treatment effect is inversely related to sample size , meaning that large samples are needed to reveal small effects ( Altman et al . , 2001 ) . In practice , appropriate determination of sample size requires realistic estimates of the treatment effect and the total variation in individual responses to given treatment ; desired level of statistical signiﬁcance for the expected results ( type I error ) ; and desired statistical power ( type II error ) . Objectives of the present study were fourfold : ( 1 ) to evaluate total variation in various biomechanical traits of whole bones ; ( 2 ) to estimate treatment effects on biome - chanical traits in experimental interventions based on ovariectomy , increased activity , and inactivity using rat femur as a model ; ( 3 ) to characterize methodological variation in biomechanical testing of rat femur to illuminate contribution of biological and methodological variation to total variation in biomechanical traits ; and ( 4 ) to devise a scheme for minimum sample size ( minSS ) needed to detect a treatment effect in biomechanical traits with statistical signiﬁcance . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Total variation in biomechanical traits We reviewed all 3472 original studies published between 1999 and 2003 in Bone , Calciﬁed Tissue International , Journal of Bone and Mineral Research , or Journal of Orthopaedic Research . We considered this sample of four major bone journals representative of contemporary status of experimental bone intervention studies . Inclusion criteria were ( 1 ) mechanical testing of whole bones was performed ; ( 2 ) bones were extracted either from rat , mouse , dog , rabbit , or monkey ; and ( 3 ) the study had an intact control group . Accordingly , 123 studies ( see Supplementary data ) were included . Number of animals ( n ) , mean and standard deviation ( S . D . ) of breaking load , stiffness , and energy absorption were collected for each control group , whenever available . When standard error of mean ( S . E . M . ) was given instead of S . D . , S . D . was calculated as S : D : ¼ ﬃﬃﬃ n p (cid:2) S : E : M : ( 1 ) Percentage variation ( s T ) in each study and trait was calculated as s T ¼ S : D : Mean (cid:2) 100 % . ( 2 ) The mean total percentage variation ( ¯ s T ) for each type of intervention and trait was calculated as ¯ s T ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃP s 2T k r , ( 3 ) where k is the number of separate studies . 2 . 2 . Treatment effects on biomechanical traits To obtain appropriate estimates of treatment effects in typical experimental bone interventions , we chose the common rat model and included studies that met the following criteria : ( 1 ) femoral shaft three - point bending test or femoral neck compression test 1 was performed ; and ( 2 ) intervention was either ovariectomy , increased activity ( climbing , treadmill training , voluntary wheel - running ) , or inactivity ( neurectomy , hindlimb suspension , limb taping ) . Altogether , data from 40 studies ( see Supplementary data ) were included . To estimate the effect size of each intervention ( in z - scores and % - values ) meta - analytic principles described in Eqs . ( 4 ) – ( 12 ) ( Eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) also apply as appropriate ) were employed ( see Appendix A ) ( Cooper and Hedges , 1994 ) . 2 . 3 . Sample size estimation The minimum sample size ( minSS ) needed to show a speciﬁed treatment effect ( d ) in mechanical traits with statistical signiﬁcance of p ¼ 0 . 05 ( if the effect truly existed ) was calculated using an approximation of Neyman’s solution ( Snedecor and Cochran , 1967 ) as minSS ¼ 7 : 9 ¯ s 2T d 2 for the statistical power of 0 : 80 ( 13 ) and minSS ¼ 10 : 5 ¯ s 2T d 2 for the statistical power of 0 : 90 . ( 14 ) 2 . 4 . Methodological variation in biomechanical traits The relationship between total variation ( s T ) , biological variation ( s B ) in the tested trait and the precision ( CV % rms ) is given by ¯ s T ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ¯ s 2B þ CV % 2rms q . ( 15 ) Several studies ( Ammann et al . , 2000 ; Jamsa et al . , 1998 ; Jarvinen et al . , 1998a , b ; Leppanen et al . , 2006 ; Peng et al . , 1994 ) have shown that the precision of biomechanical tests can be assessed using paired specimens . This approach presumes that contralateral bones are equal , which may not always be true ( Banse et al . , 1996 ; Hanson and Markel , 1994 ) . However , when the paired bones are extracted from healthy animals developed under normal circumstances , no systematic difference would apparently exist . Thus , the precision was calculated as CV % rms ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ P ð 100 (cid:2) ð right (cid:3) left = right þ left ÞÞ 2 n s , ( 16 ) where n is the number of femur pairs , and right and left denote the measured values from respective femora . Precision of femoral shaft three - point bending and femoral neck compression tests was determined using test results from femora of 60 Sprague - Dawley rats ( age : 17 – 69 weeks , and body weight : 240 – 630g ) . Excised and deﬂeshed bones were wrapped in saline - soaked gauze bandages to prevent dehydration and stored at (cid:3) 20 1 C . This procedure does not affect bone mechanical properties ( Pelker et al . , 1984 ; Sedlin and Hirsch , 1966 ) . The research protocol was accepted by Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Tampere . The study conformed to NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . At the testing day , the femora were thawed at the room tempera - ture and kept in the saline - soaked gauzes except during measurements . ARTICLE IN PRESS 1 Note that the mechanical testing of the femoral neck is rather a cantilever bending test than a compression test . However , the latter term has become established in the literature , and for the sake of consistency , the femoral neck test is called a compression test in the present study . O . V . Leppa¨nen et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 41 ( 2008 ) 1623 – 1631 1624 The bone pairs were tested on the same day , and the test order was random . All bones were analyzed by the same operator . 2 . 5 . Mechanical tests Mechanical testing of the rat femoral shaft and femoral neck was done with a material testing machine ( LR5K , J . J . Lloyd Instruments , South - ampton , UK ) according to our standard protocols ( Jarvinen et al . , 1998a , b ) . For the femoral three - point bending test , the femur was placed on its posterior surface on the lower supports of the bending apparatus . A preload ( 10N ) was ﬁrst applied to the femoral midshaft and then the bending load was applied at rate of 1 . 0mm / s until failure . The breaking load , stiffness , and energy absorption were determined from the load – deformation curve ( Fig . 1 ) . After the three - point bending , the proximal half of the femur was mounted in a ﬁxation device ( Sogaard et al . , 1994 ) , and a vertical load was applied to the top of the femoral head until the femoral neck failure . Loading parameters and the data collection were equal to those described above for the femoral shaft test . 3 . Results Table 1 gives the total variation in breaking load , stiffness and energy absorption obtained from different testing protocols among different bones and species . Clearly , rat was the most common animal in experimental bone interventions using biomechanical tests of whole bones , followed by mouse ; while other species were rarely used . Of different testing protocols , femoral shaft three - point bending was most common , followed by vertebral compression , femoral neck compression , and tibial three - point bending ; while torsion and four - point bending tests were rare . In general , total variation was smaller for breaking load than for stiffness , and particularly for energy absorption among the most common testing protocols . Given the wide ranges , total variation could vary markedly between different studies ( Table 1 ) . Of note , the total variation in rat femoral shaft three - point bending and femoral neck compression results were similar to results from other species ( Table 1 ) , supporting our choice to use these rat tests as representative models of biomechanical testing . Table 2 gives the magnitude and variation of mean treatment effects in rat femur mechanical traits in response to different interventions . Ovariectomy appears to result in (cid:4) 5 % reduction in the femoral shaft breaking load and stiffness while in the other traits , signiﬁcant effects were not apparent , the borderline (cid:4) 13 % reduction in the femoral neck stiffness excluded . Increased activity appears to increase both the femoral shaft breaking load and stiffness by (cid:4) 10 % ( no data of energy absorption were available ) , and the femoral neck breaking load by (cid:4) 6 % and stiffness by (cid:4) 36 % , while the energy absorption appears to decrease correspondingly . Inactivity seems not to affect the femoral shaft mechan - ical traits , while (cid:4) 30 % reduction in the femoral neck breaking load may be expected ( no data on other traits were available ) . A nomogram for sample size estimation is given in Fig . 2 and summarized in Table 3 . Clearly , femoral shaft three - point bending test is useful with smaller minSS ( rats / group ) than femoral neck compression test . Also , minSS is clearly smaller for breaking load than for stiffness and energy absorption in both tests . For example , minSS to show a 10 % difference in the femoral shaft breaking load with 80 % power is 11 rats / group , while corresponding minSS is 23 for the stiffness , and 53 for the energy absorption . For the femoral neck compression test , minSSs are 16 , 51 , and 134 rats / group , respectively . As a practical example of sample size estimation , ovariectomy can be expected to result in (cid:4) 5 % reduction in femoral shaft breaking load ( Table 2 ) . According to Table 3 , 42 rats / group would be needed to observe (cid:4) 5 % treatment effect with 80 % statistical power . Of note , the ARTICLE IN PRESS Fig . 1 . Determination of the breaking load , stiffness , and energy absorption from the load – deformation curve obtained during the three - point bending test of rat femur . During the testing , the femur was placed on its posterior surface on round - ended lower supports ( 4mm in diameter ) , and the loading force was applied by a round - ended intender ( 10mm in diameter ) . Using the software of the material testing machine , the breaking load was determined as the highest point of the curve , the stiffness as the tangent modulus of the linear part of the load – deformation curve , the determination being started after the force value 60N was reached . The energy absorption , in turn , was determined as the area under the load – deformation curve until the point of failure ( breaking load ) . O . V .

Precision for breaking load , stiffness and energy absorption assessments are given in Table 4 . Applying the CV % rms values ( Table 4 ) and mean percentage total variation data ( Table 1 ) to Eq . ( 15 ) , it yields that on average (cid:4) 20 – 50 % of the total variation in these biome - chanical traits are attributable to methodological uncer - tainties . 4 . Discussion Adequate sample size and sufﬁcient statistical power are prerequisites for any clinical intervention trial for obvious scientiﬁc and ethical reasons . Despite being similarly pertinent to all research , however , statistical power has received little attention in experimental bone interventions . According to our recent literature survey ( Jarvinen et al . , 2005 ) , calculation of sample size was reported only in two out of 210 studies ( Kaastad et al . , 2001 ; Kurth et al . , 2001 ) employing mechanical testing of whole bones . However , it is possible that the sample size was calculated in more studies , but was not mentioned . In practice , the calculation of sample size requires reasonable estimates of total variation in the trait of interest and the anticipated treatment effect to given intervention . To facilitate power estimation , we devised a scheme for the minimum sample size required to detect the expected treatment effect with sufﬁcient probability in response to ovariectomy , increased activity , and inactivity ; all common interventions in experimental osteoporosis research . In living organisms , the total variation observed in response to any given intervention stems from two major sources : inherent biological variation between and within individuals , and methodological variation of the test . Of the common mechanical traits , breaking load was most precise , while stiffness and energy absorption were subject to much more methodological variation . Poorer precision may also explain the fact ( Tables 1 and 2 ) that the stiffness and energy absorption results are less reported than breaking load results notwithstanding the apparently ARTICLE IN PRESS Table 2 Pooled treatment effect sizes ( in z - scores and % ) on breaking load , stiffness , and energy absorption of rat femur in response to ovariectomy , increased activity , or inactivity Effect size Percentage - transformed effect size n Model a Mean Standarderror Lower 95 % limit Upper 95 % limit Mean Standarderror Lower 95 % limit Upper 95 % limit Fixed / random Ovariectomy Femoral shaft three - point bending ( AP ) Breaking load (cid:3) 0 . 40 0 . 12 (cid:3) 0 . 64 (cid:3) 0 . 17 (cid:3) 4 . 8 1 . 4 (cid:3) 7 . 6 (cid:3) 2 . 0 44 Random Stiffness (cid:3) 0 . 28 0 . 13 (cid:3) 0 . 53 (cid:3) 0 . 03 (cid:3) 4 . 2 1 . 9 (cid:3) 8 . 1 (cid:3) 0 . 4 21 Random Energy absorption 0 . 10 0 . 14 (cid:3) 0 . 17 0 . 38 2 . 7 3 . 7 (cid:3) 4 . 6 9 . 9 17 Random Femoral neck compression Breaking load (cid:3) 0 . 19 0 . 28 (cid:3) 0 . 74 0 . 35 (cid:3) 2 . 9 4 . 2 (cid:3) 11 . 1 5 . 3 8 Random Stiffness (cid:3) 0 . 54 0 . 26 (cid:3) 1 . 05 (cid:3) 0 . 03 (cid:3) 12 . 7 6 . 0 (cid:3) 24 . 5 (cid:3) 0 . 8 3 Fixed Energy absorption 0 . 09 0 . 60 (cid:3) 1 . 09 1 . 27 2 . 6 16 . 7 (cid:3) 30 . 1 35 . 3 3 Random Increased activity Femoral shaft three - point bending ( AP ) Breaking load 0 . 97 0 . 33 0 . 32 1 . 62 10 . 4 3 . 6 3 . 4 17 . 3 8 Random Stiffness 0 . 69 0 . 19 0 . 31 1 . 07 10 . 0 2 . 8 4 . 5 15 . 5 5 Fixed Energy absorption – – – – – – – – – – Femoral neck compression Breaking load 0 . 40 0 . 12 0 . 16 0 . 64 5 . 8 1 . 7 2 . 4 9 . 2 12 Fixed Stiffness 1 . 58 0 . 41 0 . 79 2 . 38 36 . 2 9 . 3 18 . 0 54 . 5 2 Fixed Energy absorption (cid:3) 1 . 01 0 . 38 (cid:3) 1 . 75 (cid:3) 0 . 28 (cid:3) 37 . 8 14 . 0 (cid:3) 65 . 2 (cid:3) 10 . 3 2 Fixed Inactivity Femoral shaft three - point bending ( AP ) Breaking load 0 . 08 0 . 22 (cid:3) 0 . 35 0 . 51 0 . 6 1 . 7 (cid:3) 2 . 7 3 . 9 4 Fixed Stiffness 0 . 08 0 . 26 (cid:3) 0 . 42 0 . 59 1 . 1 3 . 5 (cid:3) 5 . 8 8 . 0 3 Fixed Energy absorption (cid:3) 0 . 19 0 . 26 (cid:3) 0 . 70 0 . 32 (cid:3) 4 . 1 5 . 5 (cid:3) 14 . 9 6 . 8 3 Fixed Femoral neck compression Breaking load (cid:3) 1 . 81 0 . 38 (cid:3) 2 . 54 (cid:3) 1 . 07 (cid:3) 29 . 5 6 . 1 (cid:3) 41 . 5 (cid:3) 17 . 5 2 Fixed Stiffness – – – – – – – – – – Energy absorption – – – – – – – – – – a See Appendix A for more information about ﬁxed and random - effects models .

If so , this pinpoints the importance of having precise methods so that relevant information is not missed . Reliability of biomechanical assessments is affected by many factors ( Turner and Burr , 1993 ) . Breaking load , by deﬁnition , denotes a single value of the y - axis ( magnitude of load ) of the load – deformation curve , while stiffness and energy absorption are aggregate measures and thus affected by variation in load and deformation values during the loading . Complex bone geometry , variation in size , spatial variation in material properties , relative variation in intender and support shapes , dimensions and locations in relation to individual bone geometry and material properties can all modify the mechanical behavior of the bone during the test and account for greater methodological variation . In order to optimize precision and information content of biomechanical testing of whole bones , the testing protocol should take into account individual bone anatomy and size so that each bone is subjected to identical loading ( e . g . , mode , direction , strain rate ) from the functional perspective . Given the large number of potential confounding factors in the test situation , the above goal may remain formidable in practice . In any case , employed test protocols should be standardized and their precision properly evaluated and reported . The present precision data for biomechanical assessment of rat femur ( Table 4 ) are comparable to values reported for breaking load ( CV % rms (cid:4) 4 – 5 % ) and stiffness or energy absorption ( CV % rms (cid:4) 7 – 15 % ) in the femoral shaft bending test ( Jarvinen et al . , 1998b ; Leppanen et al . , 2006 ) , and for breaking load ( CV % rms (cid:4) 5 – 15 % ) and stiffness or energy absorption ( CV % rms (cid:4) 18 – 19 % ) in the femoral neck compression ( Ammann et al . , 2000 ; Jarvinen et al . , 1998b ; Leppanen et al . , 2006 ; Peng et al . , 1994 ) .

Leppa¨nen et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 41 ( 2008 ) 1623 – 1631 1628 Compared to typical precision ( (cid:4) 1 – 2 % ) of dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) or peripheral quantita - tive computed tomography ( pQCT ) in the assessment of bone mineral content or density of rat femur ( Ammann et al . , 1992 ; Horton et al . , 2003 ; Jarvinen et al . , 1998b ; Leppanen et al . , 2006 ; Nagy et al . , 2001 ; Sievanen et al . , 1994 ) , the precision of biomechanical testing remained inferior . As the total variation in common biomechanical traits of rat femur was comparable to respective ﬁndings among other species ( Table 1 ) , the proposed scheme for sample size calculation may be considered applicable to biome - chanical testing of bones in general . However , care must be taken when extending this application to other species than rat or to other tests than femoral shaft three - point bending or femoral neck compression since the number of included studies for certain tests and / or experimental animals was occasionally small ( Table 1 ) . Also , given the large range of total variation across studies , the mean total variation obtained from only a few studies may not be representative of the actual situation . Regarding the statistical power of an experimental bone intervention to detect the expected treatment effect , biomechanical testing is not only hampered by limited precision but also by relatively small responses and slow response times . In addition , duration , intensity , or any other speciﬁc feature in the intervention or study group ( e . g . , age or sex ) may inﬂuence the magnitude of the treatment effect directly or interactively , and thus , the results may differ substantially between individual studies . Accordingly , the mean effect sizes in the present survey ( Table 2 ) are indicative while they provide reasonable estimates of expected treatment effects . As large samples are necessary to detect small responses with statistical conﬁdence ( Altman et al . , 2001 ) , experimental osteoporosis interventions using biomechanical test results as primary outcome measures should be long - term and employ large groups of animals—larger than typically used at present . According to present survey , the average sample size ( mean 7 S . D . ) was 11 7 5 animals / group . This means that many studies have been underpowered to detect mean - ingful results with statistical signiﬁcance .

Leppa¨nen et al . / Journal of Biomechanics 41 ( 2008 ) 1623 – 1631 1629 Besides statistical power , the other objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of different biomechanical traits as primary outcome measures in experimental bone interventions . Poor precision of the stiffness and energy absorption assessments—particularly in conjunction with expected , mainly small responses and large total varia - tion in these traits in response to different interventions ( Table 1 ) —challenge their utility . Clearly a substantial proportion ( 20 – 50 % ) of the total variation in measured biomechanical traits can be attributable to methodological uncertainties , and occasionally methodological variation may equal the total variation ( Leppanen et al . , 2006 ) . The latter implies no room for biological variation , which is virtually impossible but highlights crucial methodological limitations of present biomechanical assessments , particu - larly regarding the stiffness and energy absorption . While the stiffness and energy absorption would be relevant descriptors of whole bone mechanical behavior and competence , it is not self - evident whether these traits , because of poor precision and strong correlation with breaking load on average , can essentially enhance the information obtained from breaking load . The use of stiffness and energy absorption may be argued by signiﬁcant responses observed in some interventions . However , it is recalled that multiple statistical testing of several outcomes is likely to ‘‘reveal’’ seemingly signiﬁcant associations ( Eisman , 2006 ) . Also , it was recently claimed that most current published research ﬁndings can be false , particularly when studies are smaller ; when effect sizes are smaller ; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships ; or where there is greater ﬂexibility in designs , deﬁnitions , outcomes , and analytical models ( Ioannidis , 2005 ) . This alarming notion is undoubtedly relevant to experimental bone studies and warrants serious consideration . In conclusion , breaking load remains the preferable trait for analyzing and reporting mechanical response in experimental osteoporosis studies , while the utility of stiffness and energy absorption is challenged . However , if the precision of latter traits could be improved , their assessment would undoubtedly convey relevant informa - tion on bone biomechanics and be of use . Our analysis underscores the need for larger sample sizes in experi - mental bone interventions using mechanical traits as primary outcome variables . In addition , quality control of biomechanical tests including the assessment of preci - sion should be much more widely adopted .
