An Integrated Encyclopedia of DNA Elements in the Human Genome The ENCODE Project Consortium Summary The human genome encodes the blueprint of life , but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown . The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription , transcription factor association , chromatin structure , and histone modification . These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80 % of the genome , in particular outside of the well - studied protein - coding regions . Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes , providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation . The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease , and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation . Overall the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome , and an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research . The human genome sequence provides the underlying code for human biology . Despite intensive study , especially in identifying protein coding genes , our understanding of the genome is far from complete , particularly with regard to noncoding RNAs , alternatively spliced transcripts , and regulatory sequences . Systematic analyses of transcripts and regulatory information are essential to the identification of genes and regulatory regions and are an important resource for the study of human biology and disease . Such analyses can also provide comprehensive views of the organization and variability of genes and regulatory information across cellular contexts , species and individuals . The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) Project aims to delineate all functional elements encoded in the human genome 1 – 3 . Operationally , we define a functional element as a discrete genome segment that encodes a defined product ( e . g . , protein or non - coding RNA ) or displays a reproducible biochemical signature ( e . g . , protein - binding , or a specific chromatin structure ) . Comparative genomic studies suggest that 3 – 8 % of bases are under purifying ( negative ) selection 4 – 8 and therefore may be functional , although other analyses have suggested much higher estimates 9 – 11 . In a pilot phase covering 1 % of the genome , the ENCODE project annotated 60 % of mammalian evolutionarily constrained bases , but also identified many additional putative functional elements without evidence of constraint 2 . The advent of more powerful DNA sequencing technologies now enables whole genome and more precise analyses with a broad repertoire of functional assays . Here , we describe production and initial analysis of 1 , 640 datasets designed to annotate functional elements in the entire human genome . We integrate results from diverse experiments within cell types , related experiments involving 147 different cell types , and all ENCODE data with other resources , such as candidate regions from genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) and evolutionarily constrained regions .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t reveal important features about the organization and function of the human genome , including : 1 . The vast majority ( 80 . 4 % ) of the human genome participates in at least one biochemical RNA and / or chromatin associated event in at least one cell type . Much of the genome lies close to a regulatory event : 95 % of the genome lies within 8kb of a DNA - protein interaction ( as assayed by bound ChIP - seq motifs or DNaseI footprints ) , and 99 % is within 1 . 7kb of at least one of the biochemical events measured by ENCODE . 2 . Primate - specific elements as well as elements without detectable mammalian constraint show , in aggregate , evidence of negative selection ; thus some of them are expected to be functional . 3 . Classifying the genome into seven chromatin states suggests an initial set of 399 , 124 regions with enhancer - like features and 70 , 292 regions with promoter - like features , as well hundreds of thousands of quiescent regions . High - resolution analyses further subdivide the genome into thousands of narrow states with distinct functional properties . 4 . It is possible to quantitatively correlate RNA sequence production and processing with both chromatin marks and transcription factor ( TF ) binding at promoters , indicating that promoter functionality can explain the majority of RNA expression variation . 5 . Many non - coding variants in individual genome sequences lie in ENCODE - annotated functional regions ; this number is at least as large as those that lie in protein coding genes . 6 . SNPs associated with disease by GWAS are enriched within non - coding functional elements , with a majority residing in or near ENCODE - defined regions that are outside of protein coding genes . In many cases , the disease phenotypes can be associated with a specific cell type or TF . ENCODE data production and initial analyses Since 2007 , ENCODE has developed methods and performed a large number of sequence - based studies to map functional elements across the human genome 3 . The elements mapped ( and approaches used ) include RNA transcribed regions ( RNA - seq , CAGE , RNA - PET , and manual annotation ) , protein - coding regions ( mass spectrometry ) , TF - binding sites ( ChIP - seq and DNase - seq ) , chromatin structure ( DNase - seq , FAIRE - seq , histone ChIP - seq and MNase - seq ) , and DNA methylation sites ( RRBS assay ) ( Box 1 itemizes methods and abbreviations , Supplementary Table P1 details production statistics ) 3 . To compare and integrate results across the different laboratories , data production efforts focused on two selected sets of cell lines , designated “Tier 1” and “Tier 2” ( Box 1 ) . To capture a broader spectrum of biological diversity , selected assays were also executed on a third tier comprising more than 100 cell types including primary cells . All data and protocol descriptions are available at http : / / www . encodeproject . org / , and a “User’s Guide” including details of cell type choice and limitations was recently published 3 .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Box 1 Abbreviation Description RNA - seq Isolation of RNA sequences , often with different purification techniques to isolate different fractions of RNA followed by high - throughput sequencing CAGE Capture of the methylated cap at the 5 ′ end of RNA , followed by high - throughput sequencing of a small tag adjacent to the 5 ′ methylated caps . 5 ′ methylated caps are formed at the initiationof transcription , though other mechanisms also methylate 5 ′ ends of RNA RNA - PET Simultaneous capture of RNAs with both a 5 ′ methyl cap and a poly - A tail , which is indicative of a full - length RNA . This is then followed by sequencing a short tag from each end by high - throughput sequencing ChIP - seq Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing . Specific regions of cross - linked chromatin , which is genomic DNA complexed with its bound proteins , are selected by using an antibody to a specific epitope . The enriched sample is then subjected to high - throughput sequencing to determine the regions in the genome most often bound by the protein to which the antibody was directed . Most often used are antibodies to any chromatin - associated epitope , including transcription factors , chromatin binding proteins , and specific chemical modifications on histone proteins . DNaseI - seq Adaption of established regulatory sequence assay to modern techniques . The DNaseI enzyme will preferentially cut live chromatin preparations at sites where nearby there are specific ( non - histone ) proteins . The resulting cut points are then sequenced using high throughput sequencing to determine those sites “hypersensitive” to DNaseI , corresponding to open chromatin . FAIRE - seq Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements . FAIRE isolates nucleosome - depleted genomic regions by exploiting the difference in crosslinking efficiency between nucleosomes ( high ) and sequence - specific regulatory factors ( low ) . FAIRE consists of crosslinking , phenol extraction , and sequencing the DNA fragments in the aqueous phase . RRBS Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing . Bisulfite treatment of DNA sequence converts methylated cytosines to uracil . In order to focus the assay and save costs , specific restriction enzymes that cut around CpG dinucleotides can reduce the genome to a portion specifically enriched in CpGs . This enriched sample is then sequenced to quantitatively determine the methylation status of individual cytosines . Tier 1 Tier 1 cell types were the highest - priority set and comprised three widely - studied cell lines : K562 erythroleukemia cells ; GM12878 , a B - lymphoblastoid cell line that is also part of the 1 , 000 Genomes project ( http : / / 1000genomes . org ) 55 ; and the H1 embryonic stem cell ( H1 hESC ) line . Tier 2 The second - priority set of cell types in the ENCODE project which included HeLa - S3 cervical carcinoma cells , HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells , and primary ( non - transformed ) human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) . Tier 3 Any other ENCODE cell types not in Tier 1 or Tier 2 . Integration methodology For consistency , data were generated and processed using standardized guidelines , and for some assays , new quality - control measures were designed ( see refs 3 , 12 , http : / / encodeproject . org / ENCODE / dataStandards . html and Kundaje , A . Personal Communication ) . Uniform data - processing methods were developed for each assay ( see Supplementary Information and Kundaje , A . Personal Communication ) , and most assay results can be represented both as signal information , a per - base estimate across the genome and as discrete elements , regions computationally identified as enriched for signal . Extensive processing pipelines were developed to generate each representation ( M . M . Hoffman et al . , manuscript in preparation , Kundaje , A . Personal Communication ) . In addition we developed the irreproducible discovery rate ( IDR ) 13 measure to provide a robust and conservative estimate of the threshold where two ranked lists of results from biological replicates no longer agree ( i . e . , are irreproducible ) and we applied this to defining sets of Page 3 Nature .

We identified , and excluded from most analyses , regions yielding untrustworthy signals likely to be artifactual ( e . g . , multi - copy regions ) . Together , these regions comprise 0 . 39 % of the genome ( see Supplementary Information ) . The accompanying poster represents different ENCODE - identified elements and their genome coverage . Transcribed and protein - coding regions We used manual and automated annotation to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human protein - coding and non - coding RNAs as well as pseudogenes , referred to as the GENCODE reference gene set 14 , 15 ( Supplementary Table U1 ) . This includes 20 , 687 protein - coding genes ( GENCODE annotation , V7 ) , with on average 6 . 3 alternatively spliced transcripts ( 3 . 9 different protein - coding transcripts ) per locus . In total GENCODE annotated exons of protein coding genes cover 2 . 94 % of the genome or 1 . 22 % for protein - coding exons . Protein - coding genes span 33 . 45 % from the outermost start to stop codons , or 39 . 54 % from promoter to poly A site . Analysis of mass spectrometry ( MS ) data from K562 and GM12878 cell lines yielded 57 confidently - identified unique peptide sequences intergenic relative to GENCODE annotation . Taken together with evidence of pervasive genome transcription 16 , these data indicate that additional protein – coding genes remain to be found . In addition , we annotated 8 , 801 automatically derived small RNAs and 9 , 640 manually curated long non - coding RNA ( lncRNA ) loci 17 . Comparing lncRNAs to other ENCODE data indicates that lncRNAs are generated through a pathway similar to that for protein coding genes 17 . The GENCODE project also annotated 11 , 224 pseudogenes , of which 863 were transcribed and associated with active chromatin 18 . RNA We sequenced RNA 16 from different cell lines and multiple subcellular fractions to develop an extensive RNA expression catalogue . Using a conservative threshold to identify regions of RNA activity , 62 % of genomic bases are reproducibly represented in sequenced long ( > 200 nucleotides ) RNA molecules or GENCODE exons . Of these bases , only 5 . 5 % are explained by GENCODE exons . The majority of transcribed bases are within or overlapping annotated genes boundaries ( i . e . intronic ) and only31 % of bases in sequenced transcripts were intergenic 16 . We used CAGE - seq ( 5 ′ cap - targeted RNA isolation and sequencing ) to identify 62 , 403 transcription start sites ( TSSs ) at high confidence ( IDR of 0 . 01 ) in Tier 1 and 2 cell types . Of these , 27 , 362 ( 44 % ) are within 100 bp of the 5 ′ end of a GENCODE - annotated transcript or previously reported full - length mRNA . The remaining regions predominantly lie across exons and 3 ′ UTRs , and some exhibit cell type restricted expression ; these may represent the start sites of novel , cell type - specific transcripts . Finally , we saw a significant proportion of coding and non - coding transcripts processed into steady state stable RNAs shorter than 200 nucleotides . These precursors include t - , mi - , sn - and sno - RNAs and the 5 ′ termini of these processed products align with the capped 5 ′ end tags 16 . Regions bound by transcription factors , transcriptional machinery , and other proteins To directly identify regulatory regions , we mapped the binding locations of 119 different DNA - binding proteins and a number of RNA polymerase components in 72 cell types using ChIP - seq ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table N1 , ref 19 ) ; 87 ( 73 % ) were sequence - specific TFs ( TFSS ) . Overall , 636 , 336 binding regions covering 231Mb ( 8 . 1 % ) of the genome are enriched for regions bound by DNA - binding proteins across all cell types . We assessed each Page 4 Nature .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t protein - binding site for enrichment of known DNA - binding motifs and the presence of novel motifs . Overall , 86 % of the DNA segments occupied by TFSS contained a strong DNA - binding motif and in most ( 55 % ) cases , the known motif was most enriched ( Pouya Kheradpour and Manolis Kellis , personal communication ) . Protein - binding regions lacking high or moderate affinity cognate recognition sites have 21 % lower median scores by rank than regions with recognition sequences ( Wilcoxon rank sum p - value < 10 −16 ) . 82 % of the low - signal regions have high - affinity recognition sequences for other factors . In addition , when ChIP - seq peaks are ranked by their concordance with their known recognition sequence , the median DNase I accessibility is two - fold higher in the bottom 20 % of peaks than in the upper 80 % ( Genome Structure Correction 20 , GSC p - value < 10 −16 ) consistent with previous observations 21 – 24 . We speculate that low signal regions are either lower - affinity sites 21 or indirect TF target regions associated through interactions with other factors ( see also refs 25 , 26 ) . We organized all the information associated with each TF , including the ChIP - seq peaks , discovered motifs , and associated histone modification patterns , in FactorBook ( http : / / www . factorbook . org , 26 ) , a public resource which will be updated as the project proceeds . DNaseI hypersensitive sites , footprints and nucleosome - depleted regions Chromatin accessibility characterized by DNaseI hypersensitivity is the hallmark of regulatory DNA regions 27 , 28 . We mapped 2 . 89 million unique , non - overlapping DNaseI hypersensitive sites ( DHSs ) by DNase - seq in 125 cell types , the overwhelming majority of which lie distal to TSSs 29 . We also mapped 4 . 8 million sites across 25 cell types that displayed reduced nucleosomal crosslinking by FAIRE , many of which coincide with DHSs . In addition , we used micrococcal nuclease to map nucleosome occupancy in GM12878 and K562 cells 30 . In Tier 1 and Tier 2 cell types , we identified a mean of 205 , 109 DHSs per cell type ( at FDR 1 % ) , encompassing an average of 1 . 0 % of the genomic sequence in each cell type , and 3 . 9 % in aggregate . On average , 98 . 5 % of the occupancy sites of TFs mapped by ENCODE ChIP - seq ( and , collectively , 94 . 4 % of all 1 . 1 million TF ChIP - seq peaks in K562 ) lay within accessible chromatin defined by DNaseI hotspots 29 . However , a small number of factors , most prominently heterochromatin - bound repressive complexes ( e . g . , the Kap1 - SetDB1 - Znf274 complex 31 , 32 encoded by the TRIM28 , SETDB1 and ZNF274 genes ) , appear to occupy a significant fraction of nucleosomal sites . Using genomic DNaseI footprinting 33 , 34 on 41 cell types we identified 8 . 4 million distinct DNaseI footprints ( FDR 1 % ) 25 . Our de novo motif discovery on DNaseI footprints recovered ~ 90 % of known TF motifs , together with hundreds of novel evolutionarily conserved motifs , many displaying highly cell - selective occupancy patterns similar to major developmental and tissue - specific regulators . Regions of histone modifications We assayed chromosomal locations for up to 12 histone modifications and variants in 46 cell types , including a complete matrix of eight modifications across Tier 1 and Tier 2 . Because modification states may span multiple nucleosomes , which themselves can vary in position across cell populations , we used a continuous signal measure of histone modifications in downstream analysis , rather than calling regions ( M . M . Hoffman et al . , manuscript in preparation , http : / / code . google . com / p / align2rawsignal / ) . For the strongest , “peak - like” histone modifications , we used MACS 35 to characterize enriched sites . Table 2 Page 5 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t describes the different histone modifications , their peak characteristics , and a summary of their known roles ( reviewed in refs 36 – 39 ) . Our data show that global patterns of modification are highly variable across cell types , in accordance with changes in transcriptional activity . Consistent with prior studies 40 , 41 , we find that integration of the different histone modification information can be used systematically to assign functional attributes to genomic regions ( see below ) . DNA methylation Methylation of cytosine , usually at CpG dinucleotides , is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression . Promoter methylation is typically associated with repression , whereas genic methylation correlates with transcriptional activity 42 . We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing ( RRBS ) to quantitatively profile DNA methylation for an average of 1 . 2 million CpGs in each of 82 cell lines and tissues ( 8 . 6 % of non - repetitive genomic CpGs ) , including CpGs in intergenic regions , proximal promoters , and in intragenic regions ( gene bodies ) 43 , although it should be noted that the RRBS method preferentially targets CpG rich islands . We found 96 % of CpGs exhibited differential methylation in at least one cell type or tissue assayed ( K . Varley et al . Personal Communication ) , and levels of DNA methylation correlated with chromatin accessibility . The most variably methylated CpGs are found more often in gene bodies and intergenic regions , rather than in promoters and upstream regulatory regions . In addition , we identified an unexpected correspondence between unmethylated genic CpG islands and binding by P300 , a histone acetyltransferase linked to enhancer activity 44 . Because RRBS is a sequence - based assay with single - base resolution , we were able to identify CpGs with allele - specific methylation consistent with genomic imprinting , and determined that these loci exhibit aberrant methylation in cancer cell lines ( K . Varley et al . Personal Communication ) . Furthermore , we detected reproducible cytosine methylation outside CpG dinucleotides in adult tissues 45 , providing further support that this non - canonical methylation event may play important roles in human biology ( K . Varley et al . Personal Communication ) . Chromosome - interacting regions Physical interaction between distinct chromosome regions that can be separated by hundreds of kb is thought to be important in the regulation of gene expression 46 . We used two complementary chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) - based technologies to probe these long - range physical interactions . A 3C - carbon copy ( 5C ) approach 47 , 48 provided unbiased detection of long - range interactions with TSSs in a targeted 1 % of the genome ( the 44 ENCODE pilot regions ) in four cell types ( GM12878 , K562 , HeLa - S3 , and H1hESC ) 49 . We discovered hundreds of statistically significant long - range interactions in each cell type after accounting for chromatin polymer behavior and experimental variation . Pairs of interacting loci showed strong correlation between the gene expression level of the TSS and the presence of specific functional element classes such as enhancers . The average number of distal elements interacting with a TSS was 3 . 9 , and the average number of TSSs interacting with a distal element was 2 . 5 , indicating a complex network of interconnected chromatin . Such interwoven long - range architecture was also uncovered genome - wide using chromatin interaction analysis with paired - end tag sequencing ( ChIA - PET ) 50 applied to identify interactions in chromatin enriched by RNA polymerase II ( PolII ) ChIP from five cell types 51 . In K562 cells , we identified 127 , 417 promoter - centered chromatin interactions using ChIA - PET , 98 % of which were intra - chromosomal . While promoter regions of 2 , 324 Page 6 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t genes were involved in “single - gene” enhancer - promoter interactions , those of 19 , 813 genes were involved in “multi - gene” interaction complexes spanning up to several megabases , including promoter - promoter and enhancer - promoter interactions 51 . These analyses portraya complex landscape of long - range gene - element connectivity across ranges of hundreds of kb to several Mb , including interactions among unrelated genes ( Supplementary Figure Y1 ) . Furthermore , in the 5C results , 50 – 60 % of long - range interactions occurred in only one of the four cell lines , indicative of a high degree of tissue specificity for gene - element connectivity 49 . Summary of ENCODE - identified elements Accounting for all these elements , a surprisingly large amount of the human genome , 80 . 4 % , is covered by at least one ENCODE - identified element ( detailed in Supplementary Table Q1 ) . The broadest element class represents the different RNA types covering 62 % of the genome ( although the majority is inside of introns or near genes ) . Regions highly enriched for histone modifications form the next largest class ( 56 . 1 % ) . Excluding RNA elements and broad histone elements 44 . 2 % of the genome is covered . Smaller proportions of the genome are occupied by regions of open chromatin ( 15 . 2 % ) or sites of TF binding ( 8 . 1 % ) , with 19 . 4 % covered by at least one DHS or TF ChIP - seq peak across all cell lines . Using our most conservative assessment , 8 . 5 % of bases are covered by either a TF binding site motif ( 4 . 6 % ) or a DHS footprint ( 5 . 7 % ) . This however is still about 4 . 5 - fold higher than the amount of protein coding exons , and about 2 - fold higher than the estimated amount of pan - mammalian constraint . Given that ENCODE did not assay all cell types , or all TFs , and in particular has sampled few specialized or developmentally restricted cell lineages , these proportions must be underestimates of the total amount of functional bases . However , many assays were performed on more than one cell type , allowing assessment of the rate of discovery of new elements . For both DHSs and CTCF sites , the number of new elements initially increases rapidly with a steep gradient for the saturation curve and then slows with increasing numbers of cell types ( Supplementary Figure R1 and R2 ) . With the current data , at the flattest part of the saturation curve , each new cell type adds on average 9 , 500 DHS elements ( across 106 cell types ) and 500 CTCF - binding elements ( across 49 cell types ) , representing 0 . 45 % of the total element number . We modelled saturation for the DHSs and CTCF - binding sites using a Weibull distribution ( r2 > 0 . 999 ) and predict saturation at approximately 4 . 1 million ( S . E . = 108 , 000 ) and 185 , 100 ( S . E . = 18 , 020 ) sites , respectively , suggesting that we have discovered around half of the estimated total DHSs . These estimates represent a lower bound , but reinforce the observation that there is more non - coding functional DNA than either coding sequence or pan - mammalian constraint . The impact of selection on functional elements From comparative genomic studies , at least 3 – 8 % of bases are under purifying ( negative ) selection 4 – 11 indicating that these bases may potentially be functional . We previously found that 60 % of mammalian evolutionarily constrained bases were annotated in the ENCODE pilot project , but also observed that many functional elements lacked evidence of constraint 2 , a conclusion substantiated by others 52 – 54 . The diversity and genome - wide occurrence of functional elements now identified provides an unprecedented opportunity to further examine the forces of negative selection on human functional sequences . We examined negative selection using two measures that highlight different periods of selection in the human genome . The first measure , inter - species , pan - mammalian constraint ( GERP - based scores ; 24 mammals 8 ) addresses selection during mammalian evolution . The Page 7 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t second measure is intra - species constraint estimated from the numbers of variants discovered in human populations using data from the 1000 Genomes project 55 and covers selection over human evolution . In Figure 1 , we plot both these measures of constraint for different classes of identified functional elements , excluding features overlapping exons and promoters that are known to be constrained . Each graph also shows genomic background levels and measures of coding - gene constraint for comparison . Since we plot human population diversity on an inverted scale , elements that are more constrained by negative selection will tend to lie in the upper and right hand regions of the plot . For DNaseI elements ( Figure 1B ) and bound motifs ( Figure 1C ) most sets of elements show enrichment in pan mammalian constraint and decreased human population diversity , though for some cell types the DNaseI sites do not appear overall to be subject to pan - mammalian constraint . Bound TF motifs have a natural control from the set of TF motif with equal sequence potential for binding but without binding evidence from ChIP - seq experiments ; in all cases , the bound motifs show both more mammalian constraint and higher suppression of human diversity . Consistent with previous findings , we do not observe genome - wide evidence for pan - mammalian selection of novel RNA sequences ( Panel D ) . There are also a large number of elements without mammalian constraint , between 17 – 90 % for TF - binding regions as well as DHSs and FAIRE regions . Previous studies could not determine whether these sequences are either biochemically active , but with little overall impact on the organism , or are under lineage specific selection . By isolating sequences preferentially inserted into the primate lineage , which is only feasible given the genome - wide scale of this data , we are able to specifically examine this issue . The majority of primate - specific sequence is due to retrotransposon activity , but an appreciable proportion is non - repetitive primate - specific sequence . Of 104 , 343 , 413 primate - specific bases ( excluding repetitive elements ) , 67 , 769 , 372 ( 65 % ) are found within ENCODE - identified elements . Examination of 227 , 688 variants segregating in these primate specific regions revealed that all classes of elements ( RNA and regulatory ) show depressed derived allele frequencies , consistent with recent negative selection occurring in at least some of these regions ( Figure 1E ) . An alternative approach examining sequences that are not clearly under pan - mammalian constraint showed a similar result ( Luke Ward and Manolis Kellis , personal communication ) . This suggests that an appreciable proportion of the unconstrained elements are lineage specific elements required for organismal function , consistent with long standing views of recent evolution 56 , and the remainder are likely to be “neutral” elements 2 which are not currently under selection , but may still affect cellular or larger scale phenotypes without an effect on fitness . The binding patterns of TFs are not uniform , and we can correlate both inter - and intra - species measures of negative selection with the overall information content of motif positions . The selection on some motif positions is as high as protein coding exons ( Figure 1F , Luke Ward and Manolis Kellis , personal communication ) . These aggregate measures across motifs show that the binding preferences found in the population of sites are also relevant to the per - site behavior . By developing a per - site metric of population effect on bound motifs , we found that highly constrained bound instances across mammals are able to buffer the impact of individual variation 57 . Integration of ENCODE data with known genomic features Promoter - anchored integration Many of the ENCODE assays directly or indirectly provide information about the action of promoters . Focusing on the TSSs of protein - coding transcripts , we investigated the relationships among different ENCODE assays , in particular testing the hypothesis that Page 8 Nature .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t RNA expression ( “output” ) can be effectively predicted from patterns of chromatin modifications or TF binding ( “input” ) . Consistent with previous reports 58 , we observe two relatively distinct types of promoters : ( 1 ) broad , mainly C + G rich , TATA - less promoters ; and ( 2 ) narrow , TATA - box - containing promoters . These promoters have distinct patterns of histone modifications , and TF - binding sites are selectively enriched in each class ( Supplementary Figure Z1 ) . We developed predictive models to explore the interaction between histone modifications and measures of transcription at promoters , distinguishing between modifications known to be added as a consequence of transcription ( such as H3K36me3 and H3K79me2 ) and other categories of histone marks 59 . In our analyses , the best models had two components : an initial classification component ( on / off ) and a second quantitative model component . Our models showed activating acetylation marks ( H3K27ac and H3K9ac ) are roughly as informative as activating methylation marks ( H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Although repressive marks , such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 , show negative correlation both individually and in the model , removing these marks produces only a small reduction in model performance . However , for a subset of promoters in each cell line repressive histone marks ( H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 ) must be used to accurately predict their expression . We also examined the interplay between the H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 marks , both of which mark gene bodies , likely reflecting recruitment of modification enzymes by polymerase isoforms . As described previously , H3K79me2 occurs preferentially at the 5 ′ ends of gene bodies and H3K36me3 occurs more 3 ′ , and our analyses support the previous model in which the H3K79me2 to H3K36me3 transition occurs at the first 3 ′ splice site 60 . Few previous studies have attempted to build qualitative or quantitative models of transcription genome - wide from TF levels because of the paucity of documented TF - binding regions and the lack of coordination around a single cell line . We thus examined the predictive capacity of TF - binding signals for the expression levels of promoters ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast to the profiles of histone modifications , most TFs show enriched binding signals in a narrow DNA region near the TSS , with relatively higher binding signals in promoters with higher CpG content . Most of this correlation could be recapitulated by looking at the aggregate binding of TFs without specific TF terms . Together , these correlation models suggest both that a limited set of chromatin marks are sufficient to “explain” transcription and that a variety of TFs might have broad roles in general transcription levels across many genes . It is important to note that this is an inherently observational study of correlation patterns , and is consistent with a variety of mechanistic models with different causal links between the chromatin , TF and RNA assays . However it does indicate that there is enough information present at the promoter regions of genes to explain the majority of variation in RNA expression . We developed predictive models similar to those used to model transcriptional activity to explore the relationship between levels of histone modifications and inclusion of exons in alternately spliced transcripts . Even accounting for expression level , H3K36me3 has a positive contribution to exon inclusion , while H3K79me2 has a negative contribution 61 . By monitoring the RNA populations in the subcellular fractions of K562 cells , we found that essentially all splicing is co - transcriptional 62 , further supporting a link between chromatin structure and splicing . Transcription factor - binding site - anchored integration TF binding sites provide a natural focus around which to explore chromatin properties . TFs are often multi - functional and can bind a variety of genomic loci with different combinations and patterns of chromatin marks and nucleosome organization . Hence , rather than averaging chromatin mark profiles across all binding sites of a TF , we developed a Page 9 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t clustering procedure , termed the Clustered Aggregation Tool ( CAGT ) , to identify subsets of binding sites sharing similar but distinct patterns of chromatin mark signal magnitude , shape , and hidden directionality 30 . For example , the average profile of the repressive histone mark , H3K27me3 , over all 55 , 782 CTCF - binding sites in K562 shows poor signal enrichment ( Figure 3A ) . However , after grouping profiles by signal magnitude , we found a subset of 9 , 840 ( 17 . 6 % ) CTCF - binding sites that exhibit significant flanking H3K27me3 signal . Shape and orientation analysis further revealed that the predominant signal profile for H3K27me3 around CTCF peak summits is asymmetric , consistent with a boundary role for some CTCF sites between active and polycomb - silenced domains . Further examples are provided in Supplementary Figures E5 and E6 . For TAF1 , predominantly found near TSSs , the asymmetric sites are orientated with the direction of transcription . However , for distal sites , such as those bound by GATA1 and CTCF , we also observed a high proportion of asymmetric histone patterns , although independent of motif directionality . In fact , all TF - binding datasets in all cell lines show predominantly asymmetric patterns ( asymmetry ratio > 0 . 6 ) for all chromatin marks but not DNaseI ( Figure 3B ) . This suggests that most TF bound chromatin events correlate with structured , directional patterns of histone modifications , and that promoter directionality is not the only source of orientation at these sites . We also examined nucleosome occupancy relative to the symmetry properties of chromatin marks around TF - binding sites . Around TSSs , there is usually strong asymmetric nucleosome occupancy , often accounting for the majority of the histone modification signal ( for instance , see Supplementary Figure E4 ) . However , away from TSSs , there is far less concordance . For example , CTCF - binding sites typically show arrays of well - positioned nucleosomes on either side of the peak summit ( Supplementary Figure E1 ) 63 . Where the flanking chromatin mark signal is high , the signals are often asymmetric , indicating differential marking with histone modifications ( Supplementary Figure E2 and E3 ) . Thus , we confirm on a genome - wide scale that TFs can form barriers around which nucleosomes and histone modifications are arranged in a variety of configurations 63 – 66 . Further detail is explored in refs 25 , 26 , 30 . Transcription factor co - associations TF - binding regions are non - randomly distributed across the genome , with respect to both other features ( e . g . , promoters ) and other TF - binding regions . Within the Tier 1 and 2 cell lines , we found 3 , 307 pairs of statistically co - associated factors ( P value < 1E - 16 , GSC ) involving 114 out of a possible 117 factors ( 97 % ) ( Figure 4A ) . These include expected associations , such as Jun and Fos , and some more novel associations , such as TCF7L2 with HNF4alpha and FoxA2 67 ( a full listing is given in Supplementary Table F1 ) . When one considers promoter and intergenic regions separately , this changes to 3 , 201 pairs ( 116 factors , 99 % ) for promoters and 1 , 564 pairs ( 108 factors , 92 % ) for intergenic regions , with some associations more specific to these genomic contexts ( e . g . , the cluster of HDAC2 , GABPA , CHD2 , GTF2F1 , MXI1 , and MYC in promoter regions and SP1 , EP300 , HDAC2 , and NANOG in intergenic regions ( Figure 4B ) ) . These general and context - dependent associations lead to a network representation of the co - binding with many interesting properties , explored in refs 19 , 25 , 26 . In addition we also identified a set of regions bound by multiple factors representing “High Occupancy of TFs” ( HOT ) regions 68 . Genome - wide integration To identify functional regions genome - wide , we next integrated elements independent of genomic landmarks using either discriminative training methods , where a subset of known elements of a particular class were used to train a model that was then used to discover more instances of this class , or using methods in which only data from ENCODE assays were employed without explicit knowledge of any annotation . Page 10 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t For discriminative training , we used a three - step process to predict potential enhancers , described in Supplementary Info and ref 68 . Two alternative discriminative models converged on a set of ~ 13 , 000 putative enhancers in K562 cells 68 . In the second approach , two methodologically distinct unbiased approaches ( see ref 40 , 69 and M . M . Hoffman et al . , manuscript in preparation ) converged on a concordant set of histone modification and chromatin - accessibility patterns that can be used to segment the genome in each of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cell lines , although the individual loci in each state in each cell line are different . With the exception of RNA polymerase II and CTCF , the addition of TF data did not substantially alter these patterns . At this stage , we deliberately excluded RNA and methylation assays , reserving these data as a means to validate the segmentations . Our integration of the two segmentation methods ( M . M . Hoffman et al . , manuscript in preparation ) established a consensus set of seven major classes of genome states , described in Table 3 . The standard view of active promoters , with a distinct core promoter region ( TSS and PF states ) , leading to active gene bodies ( T , transcribed state ) is rediscovered in this model ( Figure 5A and B ) . There are three “active” distal states . We tentatively labelled two as enhancers ( predicted enhancers , E , and predicted weak enhancers , WE ) due to their occurrence in regions of open chromatin with high H3K4me1 , although they differ in the levels of marks such as H3K27ac , currently thought to distinguish active from inactive enhancers . The other active state ( CTCF ) has high CTCF binding and includes sequences that function as insulators in a transfection assay . The remaining repressed state ( R ) summarises sequences split between different classes of actively repressed or inactive , quiescent chromatin . We found that the CTCF - binding associated state is relatively invariant across cell types , with individual regions frequently occupying the CTCF state across all six cell types ( Figure 5C ) . Conversely , the E and T states have substantial cell - specific behaviour , whereas the TSS state has a bimodal behaviour with similar numbers of cell - invariant and cell - specific occurrences . It is important to note that the consensus summary classes do not capture all the detail discovered in the individual segmentations containing more states . The distribution of RNA species across segments is quite distinct , indicating that underlying biological activities are captured in the segmentation . Polyadenylated RNA is heavily enriched in gene bodies . Around promoters , there are short RNA species previously identified as promoter - associated short RNAs ( PASRs ) ( Figure 5B ) 16 , 70 . Similarly , DNA methylation shows marked distinctions between segments , recapitulating the known biology of predominantly unmethylated active promoters ( TSS states ) followed by methylated gene bodies 42 ( T state , Figure 5D ) . The two enhancer - enriched states show distinct patterns of DNA methylation , with the less active enhancer state ( by H3K27ac / H3K4me1 levels ) showing higher methylation . These states also have an excess of RNA elements without poly - A tails and methyl - cap RNA as assayed by CAGE sequences compared to matched intergenic controls , suggesting a specific transcriptional mode associated with active enhancers 71 . TFs also showed distinct distributions across the segments ( Figure 5B ) . A striking pattern is the concentration of TFs in the TSS - associated state . The enhancers contain a different set of TFs . For example , in K562 , the E state is enriched for binding by the proteins encoded by the EP300 , FOS , FOSL1 , GATA2 , HDAC8 , JUNB , JUND , NFE2 , SMARCA4 , SMARCB1 , SIRT6 , and TAL1 genes . We tested a subset of these predicted enhancers in both Mouse and Fish transgenic models ( examples in Figure 6 ) , with over half of the elements showing activity , often in the corresponding tissue type . The segmentation provides a linear determination of functional state across the genome , but not an association of particular distal regions with genes . By using the variation of DNaseI across cell lines , 39 % of E ( enhancer associated ) states could be linked to a proposed Page 11 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t regulated gene 29 concordant with physical proximity patterns determined by 5C 49 or ChIA - PET . To provide a fine - grained regional classification , we turned to a Self Organizing Map ( SOM ) to cluster genome segmentation regions based on their assay signal characteristics ( Figure 7 ) . The segmentation regions were initially randomly assigned to a 1 , 350 - state map in a two - dimensional toroidal space ( Figure 7A ) . This map can be visualised as a two dimensional rectangular plane onto which the various signal distributions can be plotted . For instance , the rectangle at the bottom left of Figure 7A shows the distribution of the genome in the initial randomised map . The SOM was then trained using the 12 different ChIP - seq and DNase - seq assays in the six cell types previously analyzed in the large - scale segmentations ( i . e . over 72 - dimensional space ) . After training , the SOM clustering was again visualised in two dimensions , now showing the organized distribution of genome segments ( lower right hand , Figure 7A ) . Individual data sets associated with the genome segments in each SOM map unit ( hexagonal cells ) can then be visualised in the same framework to learn how each additional kind of data is distributed on the chromatin state map . Figure 7B shows CAGE / TSS expression data overlaid on the randomly initialised ( left ) and trained map ( right ) panels . In this way the trained SOM highlighted cell type - specific TSS clusters ( bottom panels of Figure 7B ) , indicating that there are sets of tissue specific TSSs that are distinguished from each other by subtle combinations of ENCODE chromatin data . Many of the ultra - fine - grained state classifications revealed in the SOM are associated with specific gene ontology ( GO ) terms ( right panel of Figure 7C ) . For instance , the left panel of Figure 7C , identifies 10 SOM map units enriched with genomic regions associated with genes associated with the GO term ‘immune response’ . The central panel identifies a different set of map units enriched for the GO term “sequence - specific TF activity” . The two map units most enriched for this GO term , indicated by the darkest green colouring , contain genes with segments that are high in H3K27me3 in H1 hESC cells , but that differ in H3K27me3 levels in HUVEC cells . Gene function analysis with the GO ontology tool ( GREAT 72 ) reveals that the map unit with high H3K27me3 in both cell types is enriched in TF genes with known neuronal functions , whereas the neighbouring map unit is enriched in genes involved in body patterning . The genome browser shots at the bottom of Figure 7C pick out an example region for each of the two SOM map units illustrating the difference in H3K27me3 signal . Overall , we have 228 distinct GO terms associated with specific segments across one or more states ( Ali Mortazavi , personal communication ) , and can assign over one third of genes to a GO annotation solely on the basis of its multi - cellular histone patterns . Thus the SOM analysis provides a fine - grained map of chromatin data across multiple cell types , which can then be used to relate chromatin structure to other data - types at differing levels of resolution ( for instance , the large cluster of units containing any active TSS , its sub - clusters composed of units enriched in TSSs active in only one cell type , or individual map units significantly enriched for specific GO terms ) . The classifications presented here are necessarily limited by the assays and cell lines studied , and are likely to contain a number of heterogeneous classes of elements . Nonetheless , robust classifications can be made , allowing a systematic view of the human genome . Insights into human genomic variation We next explored the potential impact of sequence variation on ENCODE functional elements . We examined allele - specific variation using results from the GM12878 cells that are derived from an individual ( NA12878 ) sequenced in the 1000 Genomes project , along with her parents . Since ENCODE assays are predominantly sequence - based , the trio design allows each GM12878 dataset to be divided by the specific parental contributions at Page 12 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t heterozygous sites , producing aggregate haplotypic signals from multiple genomic sites . We examined 193 ENCODE assays for allele - specific biases using 1 , 409 , 992 phased , heterozygous SNPs and 167 , 096 indels ( Figure 8 ) . Alignment biases towards alleles present in the reference genome sequence were avoided utilising a sequence specifically tailored to the variants and haplotypes present in NA12878 ( a ‘personalised genome’ ) 73 . We found instances of preferential binding towards each parental allele . For example , comparison of the results from the POLR2A , H3K79me2 , and H3K27me3 assays in the region of NACC2 ( Figure 8A ) shows a strong paternal bias for H3K79me2 and POL2RA and a strong maternal bias for H3K27me3 , suggesting differential activity for the maternal and paternal alleles . Figure 8B shows the correlation of selected allele - specific signals across the whole genome . For instance we find a strong allelic correlation between POL2RA and BCLAF1 binding , as well as negative correlation between H3K79me2 and H3K27me3 , both at genes ( below the diagonal , bottom left ) and chromosomal segments ( top right ) . Overall we find that positive allelic correlations among the 193 ENCODE assays are stronger and more frequent than negative correlations . This may be due to preferential capture of accessible alleles and / or the specific histone modification and TF , assays used in the project . Rare variants , individual genomes and somatic variants We further investigated the potential functional effects of individual variation in the context of ENCODE annotations . We divided NA12878 variants into common and rare classes , and partitioned these into those overlapping ENCODE annotation ( Figure 9A , Supplementary Tables K1 and K2 ) . We also predicted potential functional effects : for protein - coding genes , these are either non - synonymous SNPs or variants likely to induce loss of function by frame - shift , premature stop , or splice - site disruption ; for other regions , these are variants that overlap a TF - binding site . We found similar numbers of potentially functional variants affecting protein - coding genes or affecting other ENCODE annotations , suggesting that many functional variants within individual genomes lie outside exons of protein - coding genes . A more detailed analysis of regulatory variant annotation is described in ref 74 . To further study the potential effects of NA12878 genome variants on TF binding regions , we performed peak - calling using a constructed personal diploid genome sequence for NA12878 73 . We aligned ChIP - seq sequences from GM12878 separately against the maternal and paternal haplotypes . As expected , a greater fraction of reads were aligned than to the reference genome ( see Supplementary Information , Supplementary Figure K1 ) . On average , approximately 1 % of TF - binding sites in GM12878 are detected in a haplotype - specific fashion . For instance , Figure 9B shows a CTCF - binding site not detected using the reference sequence that is only present on the paternal haplotype due to a 1 - bp deletion ( see also Supplementary Figure K2 ) . As costs of DNA sequencing decrease further , optimized analysis of ENCODE - type data should use the genome sequence of the individual or cell being analyzed when possible . Most analyses of cancer genomes to date have focused on characterizing somatic variants in protein - coding regions . We intersected four available whole - genome cancer datasets with ENCODE annotations ( Figure 9C , Supplementary Figure L2 ) . Overall somatic variation is relatively depleted from ENCODE annotated regions , particularly for elements specific to a cell type matching the putative tumor source ( e . g . , skin melanocytes for melanoma ) . Examining the mutational spectrum of elements in introns for cases where a strand - specific mutation assignment could be made reveals that there are mutational spectrum differences between DHSs and unannotated regions ( 0 . 06 Fisher’s Exact , Supplementary Figure L3 ) . The suppression of somatic mutation is consistent with important functional roles of these Page 13 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t elements within tumor cells , highlighting a potential alternative set of targets for examination in cancer . Common variants associated with human disease and phenotypes In recent years , GWAS have greatly extended our knowledge of genetic loci associated with human disease risk and other phenotypes . The output of these studies is a series of SNPs ( “GWAS SNPs” ) correlated with a phenotype , although not necessarily the functional variants . Strikingly , 88 % of associated SNPs are either intronic or intergenic 75 . We examined 4 , 860 SNP - phenotype associations for 4 , 492 SNPs curated in the NHGRI GWAS catalogue 75 . We found that 12 % of these SNPs overlap TF - occupied regions whereas 34 % overlap DHSs ( Figure 10A ) . Both figures reflect significant enrichments relative to the overall proportions of 1000 Genomes project SNPs ( about 6 % and 23 % , respectively ) . Even after accounting for biases introduced by selection of SNPs for the standard genotyping arrays , GWAS SNPs show consistently higher overlap with ENCODE annotations ( Figure 10A , see Supplementary Information ) . Furthermore , after partitioning the genome by density of different classes of functional elements , GWAS SNPs were consistently enriched beyond all the genotyping SNPs in function - rich partitions , and depleted in function - poor partitions ( see Supplementary Figure M1 ) . GWAS SNPs are particularly enriched in the segmentation classes associated with enhancers and TSSs across several cell types ( see Supplementary Figure M2 ) . Examining the SOM of integrated ENCODE annotations ( see above ) , we found 19 SOM map units showing significant enrichment for GWAS SNPs , including many SOM units previously associated with specific gene functions , such as the immune response regions . Thus , an appreciable proportion of SNPs identified in initial GWAS scans are either functional or lie within the length of an ENCODE annotation ( ~ 500 bp on average ) and represent plausible candidates for the functional variant . Expanding the set of feasible functional SNPs to those in reasonable linkage disequilibrium , up to 71 % of GWAS SNPs have a potential causative SNP overlapping a DNaseI site , and 31 % of loci have a candidate SNP that overlaps a binding site occupied by a TF ( see also refs 74 , 76 ) . The GWAS catalogue provides a rich functional categorization from the precise phenotypes being studied . These phenotypic categorizations are non - randomly associated with ENCODE annotations and there is striking correspondence between the phenotype and the identity of the cell type or TF used in the ENCODE assay ( Figure 10B ) . For example , five SNPs associated with Crohn’s disease overlap GATA2 - binding sites ( P - value 0 . 003 by random permutation or 0 . 001 by an empirical approach comparing to the GWAS - matched SNPs ; see Supplementary information ) , and fourteen are located in DHSs found in immunologically relevant cell types . A notable example is a gene desert on chromosome 5p13 . 1 containing eight SNPs associated with inflammatory diseases . Several are close to or within DHSs in Th1 and Th2 cells as well as peaks of binding by TFs in HUVECs ( Figure 10C ) . The latter cell line is not immunological , but factor occupancy detected there could be a proxy for binding of a more relevant factor , such as GATA3 , in T - cells . Genetic variants in this region also affect expression levels of PTGER4 77 , encoding the prostaglandin receptor EP4 . Thus , the ENCODE data reinforce the hypothesis that genetic variants in 5p13 . 1 modulate the expression of flanking genes , and furthermore provide the specific hypothesis that the variants affect occupancy of a GATA factor in an allele - specific manner , thereby influencing susceptibility to Crohn’s disease . Non - random association of phenotypes with ENCODE cell types strengthens the argument that at least some of the GWAS lead SNPs are functional or extremely close to functional variants . Each of the associations between a lead SNP and an ENCODE annotation remains Page 14 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 .

Supplementary Tables M1 , M2 and M3 list all 14 , 885 pairwise associations across the ENCODE annotations . The accompanying papers have a more detailed examination of common variants with other regulatory information 76 . Conclusions The unprecedented number of functional elements identified in this study provides a valuable resource to the scientific community as well as significantly enhances our understanding of the human genome . Our analyses have revealed many novel aspects of gene expression and regulation as well as the organization of such information , as illustrated by the accompanying papers ( see http : / / www . encodeproject . org / ENCODE / pubs . html for collected ENCODE publications ) . However , there are still many specific details , particularly about the mechanistic processes which generate these elements and how and where they function , that require additional experiments to elucidate . The large spread of coverage , from our highest resolution , most conservative set of bases implicated in GENCODE protein coding gene exons ( 2 . 9 % ) or specific protein DNA binding ( 8 . 5 % ) to the broadest , most general set of marks covering the genome ( approximately 80 % ) - - with many gradations in between - - presents a spectrum of elements with different functional properties discovered by ENCODE . 99 % of the known bases in the genome are within 1 . 7 kbp of any ENCODE element , whereas 95 % of bases are within 8 kb of a bound TF motif or DNaseI footprint . Interestingly , even using the most conservative estimates , the fraction of bases likely to be involved in direct gene regulation , even though incomplete , is significantly higher than that ascribed to protein coding exons ( 1 . 2 % ) , raising the possibility that more information in the human genome may be important for gene regulation than for biochemical function . Many of the regulatory elements are not constrained across mammalian evolution , which to date has been one of the most reliable indication of an important biochemical event for the organism . Thus , our data provide orthologous indicators for suggesting possible functional elements . Importantly , for the first time we have sufficient statistical power to assess the impact of negative selection on primate - specific elements , and all ENCODE classes display evidence of negative selection in these unique to primate elements . Furthermore , even with our most conservative estimate of functional elements ( 8 . 5 % of putative DNA : protein binding regions ) and assuming that we have already sampled half of the elements from our TF and cell type diversity , one would estimate that at a minimum 20 % ( 17 % from protein binding , and 2 . 9 % protein coding gene exons ) of the genome participates in these specific functions , with the likely figure significantly higher . The broad coverage of ENCODE annotations enhances our understanding of common diseases with a genetic component , rare genetic diseases , and cancer , as shown by our ability to link otherwise anonymous associations to a functional element . ENCODE and similar studies provide a first step towards interpreting the rest of the genome— beyond protein - coding genes—thereby augmenting common disease genetic studies with testable hypotheses . Such information justifies performing whole - genome sequencing ( rather than exome only , 1 . 2 % of the genome ) on rare diseases and investigating somatic variants in non - coding functional elements , for instance , in cancer . Furthermore since GWAS analyses typically associate disease to SNPs in large regions , comparison to ENCODE non - coding functional elements can help pinpoint putative causal variants in addition to refinement of location by fine - mapping techniques 78 . Combining ENCODE data with allele - specific information derived from individual genome sequences , provides specific insight on the impact of a genetic variant . Indeed , we believe a significant goal would be to use functional Page 15 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 .

To date , ENCODE has sampled 119 of 1 , 800 known TFs and general components of the transcriptional machinery on a limited number of cell types and 13 of more than 60 currently known histone or DNA modifications across 147 cell types . DNaseI , FAIRE and extensive RNA assays across subcellular fractionations have been undertaken on many cell types , but overall these data reflect a minor fraction of the potential functional information encoded in the human genome . An important future goal will be to enlarge this dataset to additional factors , modifications and cell types , complementing the other related projects in this area ( e . g . , Roadmap Epigenomics Project , http : / / www . roadmapepigenomics . org / and International Human Epigenome Consortium , http : / / www . ihec - epigenomes . org / ) . These projects will constitute foundational resources for human genomics , allowing a deeper interpretation of the organization of gene and regulatory information and the mechanisms of regulation and thereby provide important insights in human health and disease .

Impact of Selection on ENCODE Functional Elements in Mammals and Human Populations Panel A shows the levels of pan - mammalian constraint ( mean GERP score ; 24 mammals 8 , x - axis ) compared to diversity , a measure of negative selection in the human population ( mean expected heterozygosity , inverted scale , y - axis ) for ENCODE datasets . Each point is an average for a single dataset . The top right corners have the strongest evolutionary constraint and lowest diversity . Coding ( C ) , UTR ( U ) , genomic ( G ) , intergenic ( IG ) and intronic ( IN ) averages are shown as filled squares . In each case the vertical and horizontal cross hairs show representative levels for the neutral expectation for mammalian conservation and human population diversity respectively . Panel A shows the spread over all non - exonic ENCODE elements greater than 2 . 5 kb from TSSs . The inner dashed box indicates that parts of the plot have been magnified for the surrounding outer panels , although the scales in the outer plots provide the exact regions and dimensions magnified . The spread for DHS sites ( B ) and RNA elements ( D ) are shown in the plots on the left . RNA elements are either long novel intronic ( dark green ) or long intergenic ( light green ) RNAs . The horizontal cross hairs are colour coded to the relevant dataset in panel D . Panel C shows the spread of TF motif instances either in regions bound by the TF ( orange points ) or the corresponding unbound motif matches in grey , with bound and unbound points connected with an arrow in each case showing that bound sites are generally more constrained and less diverse . Panel E shows the derived allele frequency spectrum for primate specific elements with variations outside ENCODE elements in black and variations covered by ENCODE elements in red . The increase in low frequency alleles compared to background is indicative of negative selection occurring in the set of variants annotated by the ENCODE data . Panel F shows aggregation of mammalian constraint scores over the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) TF motif in bound sites , showing the expected correlation with the information content of bases in the motif .

Modelling Transcription Levels from Histone Modification and TF - Binding Patterns Panels A and B show the correlative models between either histone modifications or TFs , respectively , and RNA production as measured by CAGE tag density at TSSs in K562 . In each case the scatter plot shows the output of the correlation models ( x - axis ) compared to observed values ( y - axis ) . The bar graphs show the most important histone modifications ( A ) or TFs ( B ) in both the initial classification phase ( upper bar graph ) or the quantitative regression phase ( lower bar graph ) , with larger values indicating increasing importance of the variable in the model . Further analysis of other cell lines and RNA measurement types are reported elsewhere 59 , 79 . Page 29 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 .

Patterns and Asymmetry of Chromatin Modification at Transcription Factor - binding Sites Panel A shows the results of clustered aggregation of H3K27me3 modification signal around CTCF binding sites ( a multi - functional protein involved with chromatin structure ) . The first three left - most plots show the signal behaviour of the histone modification over all sites ( top ) and then split into the high and low signal components . The high signal component is then decomposed further into six different shape classes on the right ( see ref 30 for details ) . The shape decomposition process is strand aware . Panel B summarises shape asymmetry for DNase1 , nucleosome and histone modification signals by plotting an asymmetry ratio for each signal over all TF binding sites . All histone modifications measured in this study show predominantly asymmetric patterns at TF binding sites . Page 30 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Figure 4 . Co - association between Transcription Factors Panel A shows significant co - associations of TF pairs using the GSC statistic across the entire genome in K562 cells . The colour strength represents the extent of association ( red ( strongest ) through orange to yellow ( weakest ) ) , whereas the depth of colour represents the fit to the GSC 20 model ( white meaning that the statistical model is not appropriate ) as indicated by the key . The majority of TFs have a non - random association to other TFs , and these associations are dependent on the genomic context , meaning that once the genome is separated into promoter proximal and distal regions , the overall levels of co - association decrease , but more specific relationships are uncovered . Panel B illustrates three classes of behaviour . The first column shows a set of associations whose strength is independent of location in promoter and distal regions while the second shows a set of TFs which have stronger associations in promoter - proximal regions . Both these examples are from data in K562 cells and are highlighted on the genome wide coassociation matrix ( panel A ) by the labelled boxes A and B , respectively . The third column shows a set of TFs that show stronger association in distal regions ( in the H1 hESC cell line ) . Page 31 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 .

Integration of ENCODE Data by Genome - wide Segmentation Panel A shows an illustrative region with the two segmentations methods ( ChromHMM and Segway ) in a dense view and the combined segmentation expanded to show each state in GM12878 , beneath a compressed view of the GENCODE gene annotations . Note that at this level of zoom and genome browser resolution , some segments appear to overlap although they do not . Segmentation classes are named and coloured according to the scheme in Table 3 . Beneath the segmentations are shown each of the normalised signals that were used as the input data for the segmentations . Open Chromatin signals from the DNase 1 - seq and FAIRE assays are shown in blue , signal from histone modification ChIP - seq in red and TF ChIP - seq signal for Pol II and CTCF in green . The mauve ChIP - seq control signal ( “Input control” ) at the bottom was also included as an input to the segmentation . Panel B shows the association of selected TF ( left ) and RNA ( right ) elements in the combined segmentation states ( x - axis ) expressed as an observed / expected ratio for each combination of TF or RNA element and segmentation class using the heatmap scale shown in the keybesides each heatmap . Panel C shows the variability of states between cell lines , showing the distribution of occurrences of the state in the 6 cell lines at specific genome locations — from unique to one cell line to ubiquitous in all six cell lines for five states ( CTCF , E , T , TSS , and R ) . Panel D shows the distribution of the level of methylation at individual sites from RRBS analysis in GM12878 across the different states , showing the expecting hypomethylation at TSSs and hypermethylation of genes bodies ( T state ) and repressed ( R ) regions .

Experimental Characterisation of Segmentations Randomly sampled E state segments ( see table 3 ) from the K562 segmentation were cloned for mouse - and fish - based transgenic enhancer assays . Panel A shows a representative LacZ - stained transgenic e11 . 5 mouse embryo obtained with construct hs2065 ( EN167 , chr10 : 46 , 052 , 882 - 46 , 055 , 670 , GRCh37 ) . Highly reproducible staining in the blood vessels was observed in 9 out of 9 embryos resulting from independent transgenic integration events . Panel B shows a representative green fluorescent protein reporter transgenic medaka fish obtained from a construct with a basal hsp70 promoter on meganuclease based transfection . Reproducible transgenic expression in the circulating nucleated blood cells and the endothelial cell walls was seen in 81 out of 100 transgenic tests of this construct . Page 33 Nature .

High - Resolution Segmentation of ENCODE Data by Self - Organising Maps ( SOM ) The training of the self - organising map ( panel A ) and analysis of the results ( panels B and C ) are shown . Initially we arbitrarily placed genomic segments from the chromHMM segmentation on to the toroidal map surface , although the SOM does not use the chromHMM state assignments ( panel A ) . We then trained the map using the signal of the 12 different ChIP - seq and DNase - seq assays in the six cell types analysed . Each unit of the SOM is represented here by an hexagonal cell in a planar two - dimensional view of the toroidal map . Curved arrows indicate that traversing the edges of two dimensional view leads back to the opposite edge . The resulting map can be overlaid with any class of ENCODE or other data to view the distribution of that data within this high - resolution segmentation . In panel A the distributions of genome bases across the untrained and trained map ( left and right , respectively ) are shown using heatmap colours for log 10 values . Panel B shows the distribution of TSSs from CAGE experiments of GENCODE annotation on the planar representations of either the initial random organisation ( left ) or the final trained SOM ( right ) using heat maps coloured according to the accompanying scales . The bottom half of panel B expands the different distributions in the SOM for all expressed TSSs ( left ) or TSSs specifically expressed in two example cell lines , H1 hESC ( centre ) and HepG2 ( right ) . Panel C shows the association of Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms on the same Page 34 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 .

We assigned genes that are within 20 kb of a genomic segment in a SOM unit to that unit , and then associated this set of genes with GO terms using a hypergeometric distribution after correcting for multiple testing . Map units that are significantly associated to GO terms are now coloured green , with increasing strength of colour reflecting increasing numbers of genes significantly associated with the GO terms for either immune response ( left ) or sequence - specific TF activity ( centre ) . In each case , specific SOM units show association with these terms . The right - hand panel shows the distribution on the same SOM of all significantly associated GO terms , now colouring by GO term count per SOM unit . For sequence - specific TF activity , two example genomic regions are extracted at the bottom of panel C from neighbouring SOM units . These are regions around the DBX1 ( from SOM unit 26 , 31 , left panel ) and IRX6 ( SOM unit 27 , 30 , right panel ) genes , respectively , along with their H3K27me3 ChIP - seq signal for each of the Tier 1 and 2 cell types . For DBX1 , representative of a set of primarily neuronal TFs associated with unit 26 , 31 , there is a repressive H3K27me3 signal in both H1 hESC and HUVEC cells ; for IRX6 , representative of a set of body patterning TFs associated with SOM unit 27 , 30 , the repressive mark is restricted largely to the embryonic stem cell .

Allele - Specific ENCODE Elements Panel A shows representative allele - specific information from GM12878 cells for selected assays around the first exon of the NACC2 gene ( genomic region chr9 : 138 , 950 , 000 - 138 , 995 , 000 , GRCh37 ) . Transcription signal is shown in green , and the three sections show allele specific data for three datasets ( POLR2A , H3K79me2 and H3K27me3 ChIP - seq ) . In each case the purple signal is the processed signal for all sequence reads for the assay , while the blue and red signals show sequence reads specifically assigned to either the paternal or maternal copies of the genome , respectively . The set of common SNPs from dbSNP , including the phased , heterozygous SNPs used to provide the assignment , are shown at the bottom of the panel . NACC2 has a statistically significant paternal bias for POLR2A and the transcription associated mark H3K79me2 , and has a significant maternal bias for the repressive mark H3K27me3 . Panel B shows pairwise correlations of allele specific signal within single genes ( below the diagonal ) or within individual ChromHMM segments across the whole genome for selected DNase - seq and histone modification and TF ChIP - seq assays .

Examining ENCODE Elements on a per individual basis in the Normal and Cancer Genome Panel A shows the breakdown of variants in a single genome ( NA12878 ) by both frequency ( common or rare ( i . e . , variants not present in the low - coverage sequencing of 179 individuals in the pilot 1 European panel of the 1000 Genomes project 55 ) and by ENCODE annotation , including protein - coding gene and non - coding elements ( GENCODE annotations for protein - coding genes , pseudogenes , and other ncRNAs , as well as TF - binding sites from ChIP - seq datasets , excluding broad annotations such as histone modifications , segmentations , and RNA - seq ) . Annotation status is further subdivided by predicted functional effect , being non - synonymous and missense mutations for protein - coding regions and variants overlapping bound TF motifs for non - coding element annotations . A substantial proportion of variants are annotated as having predicted Page 38 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 .

Comparison of Genome - wide Association Study - identified Loci with ENCODE Data Panel A shows overlap of lead SNPs in the NHGRI GWAS SNP catalog ( June 2011 ) with DHSs ( left ) or TF - binding sites ( right ) as red bars compared to various control SNP sets in blue . The control SNP sets are : SNPs on the Illumina 2 . 5M chip as an example of a widely used GWAS SNP typing panel ; SNPs from the 1 , 000 Genomes project ; SNPs extracted from 24 personal genomes ( see Personal Genome Variants track at http : / / main . genome - browser . bx . psu . edu 80 all shown as blue bars . In addition a further control utilised 1 , 000 randomisations from the genotyping SNP panel , matching the SNPs with each NHGRI catalog SNP for allele frequency and distance to the nearest TSS ( light blue bars with bounds at 1 . 5 times the interquartile range , and any outliers beyond shown as circles ) . For both DHSs and TF binding regions , a larger proportion of overlaps with GWAS - implicated SNPs is found compared to any of the controls sets . Panel B shows the aggregate overlap of phenotypes to selected TF - binding sites ( left matrix ) or DHSs in selected cell lines ( right matrix ) , with a count of overlaps between the phenotype and the cell line / factor . Values in green squares pass an empirical p - value threshold < = 0 . 01 ( based on the same analysis of overlaps between randomly chosen , GWAS - matched SNPs and these epigenetic features ) and have at least a count of 3 overlaps . The p - value for the total number of phenotype - TF associations is < 0 . 001 . Panel C shows several SNPs associated Page 40 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 March 06 .
