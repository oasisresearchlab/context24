Revi Sterling John K . Bennett Abstract This paper examines 40 articles published in Information Technologies & Inter - national Development between 2003 and 2010 to identify commonalities among projects that failed to meet some or all of their development objec - tives . We considered whether the selected papers articulated clear develop - ment objectives and whether baseline data were used to inform project de - sign . We then evaluated two factors associated with how the development objectives were implemented : the development perspective ( top - down vs . bottom - up ) and the project focus ( the technology vs . the community ) . Our goal was not to ªnd fault with our colleagues or their work ; rather , we sought to advance the debate about the effectiveness of ICTD initiatives . We conclude that top - down , technology - centric , goal - diffuse approaches to ICTD contribute to unsatisfactory development results . Careful consideration of development objectives , perspective , and focus is essential in all phases of an ICTD project , from design through deployment . Honest and comprehensive reporting of fail - ure ( and success ) helps ICTD researchers and practitioners to focus on best practices in meeting critical development needs . 1 . Introduction Information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) continue to be rapidly integrated into poverty alleviation and social development programs across the developing world in the continued hope that computer literacy , Internet access , and mobile phone usage will transform the lives and liveli - hoods of the world’s poor . As Heeks and Molla have observed , “Billions of US dollars are invested each year by the public , NGO and private sectors in information - and - communication - technologies - for - development projects such as telecentres , village phone schemes , e - health and e - education pro - jects , e - government kiosks , etc . ” ( 2009 , p . 1 ) . Parallel to this substantial investment of money and interest in informa - tion and communication technologies for development ( ICTD ) is a corre - sponding increase in expectations of development “achievement” through planned ICT interventions and organic ICT adoption . The World Bank is on record in support of the transformative potential of ICTs : “ICT promotes innovation and can trigger fundamental economic transformation . Individ - 1 .

The bank has backed its optimism that ICTs can reduce poverty , boost eco - nomic growth , and spur accountability with billions of dollars’ worth of investment in such large - scale projects as the build - out of national broadband net - works and other backbone infrastructure initiatives . High expectations are not limited to the World Bank and sector - level investments . Bhavnani , Won - Wai Chiu , Janakiram , and Silarsky ( 2008 ) speak both to the explosive growth in mobile phone ownership and coverage , and to the social and economic beneªts that mobile telephony can provide to the rural poor . The GSM Association highlights studies demonstrating how mobile phones drive everything from “improvements in social links , the creation of social capital , improved market information ºows and productivity , as well as increases in GDP and Foreign Direct Investment” ( GSMA , 2008 , p . 1 ) . Despite being designed and implemented with the best of intentions , most ICTD interventions fail . Some ICTD projects fail outright , some are unsuc - cessful at achieving their stated goals , and many founder in the ªeld . For example , the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group summarized much of the Bank’s $ 4 . 2 billion spent on ICT efforts as “lim - ited” and “largely unsuccessful” ( 2011 , pp . vii – ix ) . Heeks ( 2002 ) estimates that developing country information systems projects have a failure rate near 80 % . This estimate includes total failures , which Heeks deªnes as initiatives that are never imple - mented ; those that are immediately abandoned ; and partial failures , which involve the non - attainment of major goals or signiªcant undesirable outcomes . We employ these interpretations of failure in our analy - sis of 40 articles published in Information Technol - ogies & International Development between 2003 and 2010 to identify commonalities among projects that failed to meet some or all of their development objectives . The deªnition and analysis of failure in ICTD is a complicated undertaking , in part because the multi - disciplinary nature of our work includes a rich breadth of efforts , including interventionist ICTD programs , support for widespread mobile phone adoption , and prototype - centric ªeld research . While the ITID papers we reviewed cover a limited number of projects , they represent activities ranging from the introduction of nationwide information systems to small - scale local interventions , to observational studies of ICT . This range of research scale and scope helped to frame our analysis . The development community periodically exam - ines “lessons learned” at conferences and symposia , in failure reports ( Engineers Without Borders Can - ada , 2011 ) , and at FAILFaires ( FAILFaire , n . d . ) . At FAILFaires , ICTD colleagues and collaborators present difªcult or surprising issues related to ICTD “fail - ures” in a good - natured and congenial environ - ment . 2 Our point is that , while there is no lack of documentation on failures , ICTD researchers and practitioners still do not appear to take full advan - tage of the fruits of our failures . We are not suc - ceeding at learning from or embracing the lessons from prior research and experience . Best explains that “we have collectively failed to stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before us . . . The problem is not the failures . The problem is our failure to learn from the failures” ( 2010 , p . 51 ) . This lack of critical self - evaluation is common in emerg - ing ªelds such as ICTD , but it is particularly problem - atic when community development itself is at stake . These 40 ITID papers contribute ( intentionally or not ) to the rich corpus of documentation and discussion into the kind of ICTD interventions that work best under complex developing country contexts . We do not use the word “failure” pejoratively . We deªne it simply as the outcome of a case in which an ICTD initiative has failed to meet some or all of its objectives . We examined many facets of each project , seeking to understand where failure or problems might manifest . The resulting partial proj - ect critiques should not be construed as global cri - tiques of either the projects or the persons involved . We examine failure through three criteria : devel - opment objectives , development perspective , and development focus . We began by considering whether the selected papers articulated clear devel - opment objectives , such as a particular Millennium Development Goal . We also considered what met - rics , if any , underpinned the pursuit of that goal , as 20 Information Technologies & International Development CONSIDERING FAILURE 2 . ICTD 2012 hosted a standing - room - only FAILFaire that featured presentations on how racism and religious beliefs can create roadblocks in research , as well as on an education initiative that foundered because of inconsistent student participation and interruptions in the school year . well as whether baseline data were used to inform project design . We then considered two factors associated with how development objectives are implemented : 1 ) perspective ( top - down vs . bottom - up ) and 2 ) focus ( was it on the technology or the community ? ) . We used this second variable to con - sider whether the project favored technology cen - trism or community centrism , understanding that this choice is usually not binary . In technology - centric projects , technology is the starting point and design is typically externally conceived and complete before there is signiªcant engagement with the developing community . These initiatives generally focus on the complexities and requirements of hard - ware , software , or systems that are generally con - ceived and developed in a laboratory or institutional setting prior to ªeld deployment . Community - centric design , on the other hand , is led by community par - ticipants and based on the perspectives of the indi - viduals who comprise the community . It calls for community input and recognition of local circum - stances in the design and deployment of the ICT . The success of the ICTD project hinges on how the technologist translates this input into software and hardware . These initiatives give prominence to issues of social context , local culture , and other sociologi - cal and community - centered factors . When commu - nity development is the primary objective of the research or intervention , the needs of the commu - nity must be a priority in ICTD project design . 2 . Related Work To assist in understanding the complex dynamics involved in interventions designed to improve the quality of life in poor or underserved areas , we look to literature from the larger international develop - ment industry as a barometer . Criticisms of “Devel - opment with a capital D” ºow freely through the work of Easterly ( 2006 ) , Moyo ( 2009 ) , and others who point out the ineffectiveness of top - down development efforts . The ICTD ªeld faces the same set of questions , but with additional concerns : Tech - nologists are often unversed in development litera - ture , and technology is often viewed as a neutral , bias - free tool . Yet , as imbued with meaning as any object , technologies and their intrinsic value systems affect communities and social ecosystems . This con - cept is explored by Best ( 2010 ) , Burrell and Toyama ( 2009 ) , Heeks and Molla ( 2009 ) , Hosman ( 2010 ) , Tongia and Subrahmanian ( 2006 ) , and Wade ( 2002 ) , who discuss the “unanticipatable interactions” ( Wade , 2002 , p . 448 ) and incompatibilities of some ICT systems with developing communities . Hosman furthers this theme in her study of persistent macro - level mistakes and misjudgments in reviewing the failures of education technologies in developing countries . These include erroneous assumptions about what ICTs can and cannot accomplish , failures to produce ecosystems of technology adoption , and failures to plan for the large and long - term commit - ment necessary for project sustainability and societal change . We are reminded that “merely providing tech does not automatically create a need for it , nor does it foster a culture of use” ( Hosman , 2010 , p . 50 ) . Tongia and Subrahmanian write that “ICT4D is a wicked problem ! ” ( 2006 , p . 202 ) that cannot be tested deªnitively—something echoed in complaints of lack of methodological rigor and the need for greater precision in ICTD reporting ( Burrell & Toyama , 2009 ; Donner & Toyama , 2009 ; Dorºinger & Gross , 2010 ) . Development economists Banerjee and Duºo ( 2011 ) ; Krishna et al . ( 2006 ) ; Collins , Morduch , Rutherford , and Ruthven ( 2009 ) ; and oth - ers have applied economic models and random trials to study development efforts , and have been able to uncover intransigencies and nuances of social mobil - ity and poverty from this economic perspective . The ICTD research ªeld could consider these models , although they are difªcult to conduct and the results are not always or easily generalizable . ICTD researchers may also beneªt from contributions from the ªeld of behavioral economics , as well as such economic sociologists as Granovetter ( 1985 ) , who elaborates on the signiªcance of cultural con - texts in social action . His interpretation of economic activity , as informed and grounded in concrete , ongoing , interpersonal relationships , adds to an understanding of the uptake and use of new tech - nologies as embedded in social relations . The close relationships among ICTD , “wicked problems , ” and failures are explored further with models that attempt to identify reasons for failure , such as Heeks’ ( 2009 ) design - reality gap model . This is further expanded by Mengesha to include “indig - enous techno - scientiªc capacity” gaps ( 2010 , p . 35 ) . Best and Kumar’s ( 2008 ) discussion of critical suc - cess and failure factors investigates the sustainability of ICTD projects along social , ªnancial , political , Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 21 DODSON , STERLING , BENNETT institutional , technological , and environmental dimensions , as does Duncombe’s ( 2009 ) compen - dium of “Concepts , Methods and Lessons for Practices . ” Management specialists and NGO ( non - governmental organization ) administrators also con - tribute to our understanding of failure from a ªeld - based perspective : Banga , Liesman , Meulensteen , and Wiemer’s ( 2009 ) in - depth study , “Budgets , Bat - teries , and Barriers , ” investigates the relationship among ªnancial , technical , and institutional barriers that prevent groups from implementing technology into ªeld programs . Baumard and Starbuck ( 2005 ) ask why we continue to not learn from failures . Sitkin ( 1992 ) suggests we pursue intelligent failure , while Edmonson and Cannon ( 2005 ) promote an “offensive” approach to learning from failure through deliberate experimentation . Science , technology , and society ( STS ) studies fur - ther inform this analysis . The input - process - output models of Rogers ( 2003 ) and DeLone and McLean’s ( 2003 ) IS success model continue to provide a framework to explain the propensity toward techno - logical / technology - centric approaches to ICTD inter - ventions . “Ecosystem” approaches to ICTs that blend social and technological ICT elements are also relevant to the debate on technology context versus community context . Orlikowski and Iacono’s seminal work on the information technology artifact — “those bundles of material and cultural properties packaged in some socially - recognizable form such as hardware and / or software” ( 2001 , p . 19 ) —is rele - vant when researchers and users position technolo - gies in myriad roles , including tools , representations , and proxies , or as parts of a larger societal network . Dourish also addresses macro - level design decisions in his plea to designers to account for the “ºexibility with which [ technology ] will be put into practice” ( 2004 , p . 64 ) . While not speciªcally referencing developing communities , Dourish asserts that the “designer needs to focus on ways for the user to understand the tool and understand how to apply it to each situation” ( ibid . , p . 173 ) , which can be all the more critical in human development initiatives . Likewise , while Sproull and Kiesler ( 1992 ) do not directly address developing communities , their work on ªrst - level deviation - reducing effects of an ICT ( the anticipated , technical , planned gains ) and the difªculties in predicting second - level deviation - amplifying feedbacks ( involving skills , behaviors , and ways of thinking ) are uniquely appropriate in analyz - ing ICTD project outcomes . Mengesha blends these technical and social literatures in a review of a public health information system in Ethiopia as “a complex sociotechnical activity in which the social and the technical negotiate and evolve together” ( 2010 , p . 46 ) . It is these negotiations that underpin the three criteria used to analyze the ICTD projects examined in this paper . 3 . Methodology Our analysis considered ICTD research published in Information Technologies & International Develop - ment ( ITID ) over the course of eight years ( between Fall 2003 and Winter 2010 ) . In all , 40 peer - reviewed ITID papers , all but a handful of them research arti - cles , were examined . These 40 studies describe pro - jects in 59 countries . A small number of papers published as research articles or research reports did not have qualitative or quantitative ªndings , and thus could not be coded or analyzed . Two ITID “Notes from the Field” pieces ( Alampay & Bala , 2010 ; Mascarenhas , 2010 ) were included in the analysis . ITID conference summaries , book reviews , and ( with the two noted exceptions ) notes from the ªeld were excluded from the analysis . We examined research conducted by both academic researchers and practitioners . Interventions , implementation studies , and ICT use studies ( where ICTs were already in place ) , including papers that used both primary and secondary data , were present in the sample . The majority of the implementation studies represented pre - adoption research . In this paper , we use the term ‘article’ as a general term for the research we studied . We assessed projects based on three factors pres - ent in most ICTD research : development objective , development perspective , and development focus . For each project , we explored the extent to which these three factors inºuenced community accep - tance of the project : factors that inºuence decision making at early phases of project planning are cap - tured in the development perspective ; development objectives inºuence project design ; and the develop - ment focus reºects the researchers’ approach to integrating technology into the community . Our classiªcation system provides insight into features that cut across ICTD initiatives , regardless of scale , location , or technology . Finally , we gathered commentary recorded by the 22 Information Technologies & International Development CONSIDERING FAILURE authors regarding unexpected results , as well as their reºections on user behavior related to project success or failure . Development Objective : Macro - Level Project Goals We began our analysis by investigating whether the published research could be directly linked to a spe - ciªed development goal , including whether the research was associated with one of the eight Mil - lennium Development Goals . 3 The development objective is a macro - level determination of the development project’s intent and broad goals . Deci - sions related to the development objective are nor - mally made at the early stages of project design . Development Perspective : Mid - Level Approach to Project We coded the selected papers for whether the rela - tionship with the study community was top - down or bottom - up . While such determinations are rarely binary , for the purposes of this study , projects are grouped into either a top - down ( generally initiated by the researcher or an institution ) or bottom - up ( generally initiated by the community ) development path . We looked for evidence of whether a research project had a hierarchical ( top - down ) or grassroots , community - led ( bottom - up ) approach to develop - ment . The choice of development perspective set the spirit and tone of an ICTD study or project , and it guided the formation of relationships between stakeholders and researchers . Issues related to the choice of development perspective often arose at early stages of project planning and decision making . Development Focus : Micro - Level Engagement with the Community In our analysis , we considered development focus to be the primary iterative state , encompassing negoti - ations with the community , codesign of an ICT solu - tion , and the point at which technology is installed and tested . We assessed whether the reported research was centered on the needs of a particular community ( community - centric ) , or whether it appeared to focus on a technological solution to a perceived problem or set of problems ( technology - centric ) . Technology - centric research places the ICT at the center of the intervention , giving prominence to interface features , design elements , etc . Commu - nity - centric research emphasizes and is responsive to community - identiªed needs . Projects of this type generally derive from a need identiªed ªrst within the community ; ICTs are then designed and imple - mented in response to that speciªc need . In coding for the technology - centric / community - centric factor , we analyzed only intervention and implementation studies , not observational studies , as those did not involve the introduction of a tech - nology in a developing community . 4 . Results This section summarizes the results of the analysis of development objectives , perspectives , and focus in the 40 ITID articles examined . 4 . 1 Speciªc References to Failure The ITID literature reºects a healthy awareness of the stubborn challenges that can impede the suc - cessful implementation of ICTD projects . Of the papers examined , 70 % ( 28 of the 40 ) referred to or reºected on some level of failure or unintended negative outcomes related to the use , uptake , or adoption of ICTs in developing communities . These failures and obstacles occurred during all phases of the projects : from decisions about design , to infra - structure and distribution issues , to point - of - use . Some references to failure highlighted all - too - familiar challenges of ICTD interventions . In one instance , an education - technology project in rural Uganda suffered mundane but signiªcant problems that included outdated donated , power - hungry computers and solar panels that toppled in the wind ( Hosman , 2010 ) . In “Warana Unwired , ” Veeraraghavan , Yasodar , and Toyama tested a re - placement for a failed PC system for sugarcane management , because PCs were “overkill and cost too much to maintain” ( 2009 , p . 81 ) . In their study of the usefulness of telecenters in Colombia , Parkin - son and Lauzon ( 2008 ) found that , while telecenters may be designed , funded , and staffed to provide livelihoods and equity access , they weren’t used by Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 23 DODSON , STERLING , BENNETT 3 . The eight Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) are to eradicate extreme hunger ( MDG # 1 ) ; achieve universal pri - mary education ( MDG # 2 ) ; promote gender equality and the empowerment of women ( MDG # 3 ) ; reduce child mortal - ity ( MDG # 4 ) ; improve maternal health ( MDG # 5 ) ; combat HIV / AIDS , malaria , and other diseases ( MDG # 6 ) ; ensure environmental sustainability ( MDG # 7 ) ; and develop global partnerships ( MDG # 8 ) . For further information , see www . un . org / millenniumgoals the target population or for those development goals . Mengesha ( 2010 ) recounts that the result of an HIV / AIDs information system in Ethiopia was neg - ative . In their study of ICT use to boost employment opportunities for young people , Mariscal , Gutierrez , and Botelho found that “ICT programs do not often produce entrepreneurs” ( 2009 , p . 26 ) nor do participants’ positive perceptions translate into employment . Richardson’s ( 2008 ) investigation of educational reform in Cambodia provided a litany of reasons why national ICT policies can sometimes fail : The government resisted its own policy , there was no plan in place to train teachers , there was no community - level support , and a World Bank con - tract was canceled due to apparent corruption in Cambodia . 4 . 2 Development Objectives : Goals and Metrics We found that fewer than half ( 43 % ) of the 40 research projects bore any relation to a Millennium Development Goal ( MDG ) . Using the MDGs as a guide , six ( 15 % ) ITID research studies focused on efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty through agricultural initiatives . Seven ( 18 % ) ITID articles focused on education projects . None of the 40 ITID research articles analyzed focused on child or mater - nal health concerns ( MDGs # 4 and # 5 ) . Gender equality and women’s empowerment ( MDG # 3 ) , in terms of access to and use of ICTs , are also largely absent from this body of work . Few ITID research articles disaggregated ICT use by gender . Only one study out of the 40 reviewed , Sinha’s ( 2009 ) obser - vational study in Bhutan , had a speciªc gender theme . There were no implementation studies that focused exclusively on women’s access to or use of ICTs . Articles related to ICTD and gender have been published in other venues ( e . g . , the ICTD conference series ) , but their absence from ITID is noticeable . Combating HIV and AIDS ( MDG # 6 ) is mentioned in two ( 5 % ) of the ITID research articles examined . Research directed at ensuring environmental sustainability ( MDG # 7 ) , including ICTD research related to climate change , biodiversity and habitat loss , access to safe drinking water and sanitation , or improving the lives of slum dwellers , is not a topic of research in any of the 40 articles . We found that 23 ( 57 % ) of the ITID research studies referred to development sectors that were outside of the MDGs . The majority of this subset of studies related to the role of ICT in the context of employment or livelihood activities ( 10 articles ) . Four ( 10 % ) articles made no reference to a development goal or a development sector . 4 . 3 Poverty Metrics This coding category identiªed speciªc poverty met - rics addressed by the projects , i . e . , whether the proj - ect was designed to “move the needle” on issues crucial to human development . We pursued this line of inquiry because ICTD is fundamentally deªned by its commitment to development . Furthermore , many ICTD initiatives have a social change agenda . There - fore , it seemed reasonable that ICTD researchers submitting their work to a technology and develop - ment journal would highlight how or whether their 24 Information Technologies & International Development CONSIDERING FAILURE Table 1 .

Poverty metrics are one set of tools used to discover and track changes in community condi - tions . An awareness of baseline conditions can help in both the design of the intervention and the out - come assessment . Approximately 25 % of the studies either col - lected primary data on local conditions or conducted baseline surveys . We found that some researchers explicitly referenced detailed , local - level poverty met - rics , while other researchers referenced large - scale data , such as levels of foreign direct investment , national mobile phone penetration rates , or such metrics as the literacy rates of nearby countries , as justiªcation for their studies . Some researchers made no such references . Additionally , when considering a broad view of such metrics ( e . g . , unemployment rates , number of schools , availability of potable water , etc . ) , we found that fewer than half ( 45 % ) of the studies we reviewed incorporated poverty statistics of any kind as a rationale or basis for research design . Researchers routinely acknowledge the importance of baseline surveys , and many suggest that prior conditions be qualitatively recorded or quantitatively measured . However , local - level data were largely absent from the 40 studies published in ITID between 2003 and 2010 , despite the availability of resources to help target improvements at the com - munity level and analyze change . For instance , most large NGOs have monitoring and evaluation tem - plates , and frameworks are available to evaluate projects under budget , time , and data availability constraints ( Bamberger , Rugh , Church , & Fort , 2004 ) . 4 . 4 Development Perspective : Top - Down or Bottom - Up Despite the best intentions to collaborate across academic and user communities , multiple authors reºected on how the ICTD research environment became competitive and political , rather than collab - orative ( Mengesha , 2010 ; Richardson , 2008 ; Vasudevan , 2007 ) . For example , the StoryBank proj - ect zeroed in on technical and social factors that lead to devices and content being “more hierarchi - cally managed and controlled than expected” ( Frohlich et al . , 2009 , p . 19 ) . Problems of this type may be able to be mitigated by adjusting the devel - opment perspective from a top - down to a more bottom - up focus . or by attempting to create hybrid projects that blend top - down project execution with bottom - up practices . The problems mentioned by these authors are not due solely to the choice of a top - down or bot - tom - up development perspective , but it does appear that , despite support from governments , some top - down projects suffered from a lack of understanding of community dynamics and community needs . Top - down support is often crucial to ICTD initiatives ( Anokwa et al . , 2009 ) : Institutional funding provides critical momentum , academic collaboration can strengthen a project , and partnering with agencies can provide much - needed access and insight . Bot - tom - up development that seeks to serve a commu - nity need also has its perils : Long periods in the ªeld may be required , and projects can be slow , demand - ing , diffuse , and potentially ineffective . The majority of research articles we sampled dis - played a top - down , push approach to development , some of which overlooked local context . Korsah , Mostow , and Dias’ ( 2010 ) research on an automated reading tutor was a largely top - down project : This proof - of - concept study applied U . S . technology that was initially introduced for tests in Ghana and Zam - bia with no adjustments to U . S . - accented English or storylines . Local and regional accents appeared to clutter the ICT implementation , although the researchers ultimately concluded that local content would be “good , ” and that the technology showed promise . Dangwal , Jha , Chatterjee , and Mitra’s ( 2005 ) study was similarly top - down . It was designed to test whether young people in Karnataka villages could teach themselves the meaning of Microsoft icons as a proxy for learning . In contrast , Wagner , Daswani , and Karnati’s ( 2010 ) mother tongue - learning software project blended a top - down approach with signiªcant amounts of collaboration with the community— although they concluded that their results showed only marginal impact , and that ICTs did not provide a broad “magic bullet” for learning . Panchard , Rao , Prabhakar , Hubaux , and Jamadagni’s ( 2007 ) study relied on user participation from local farmers to produce environmental information for a decision - support system , an experimental technology that the authors ultimately concluded had merit , although it faced hurdles of scale , availability , and affordability . While the Livestock Guru ( Heffernan & Nielsen , 2007 ) was also a top - down , technology - Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 25 DODSON , STERLING , BENNETT centric implementation project , the project incorpo - rated a signiªcant amount of country - speciªc live - stock disease information . Digital Green ( Gandhi , Veeraraghavan , Toyama , & Ramprasad , 2009 ) used a participatory process for content production and a locally generated video database . These studies conªrm the merits of engaging the community . They also remind us that engagement does not guarantee “success . ” 4 . 5 Development Focus : Technology - Centric or Community - Centric Of the 40 studies reviewed , 19 ( 48 % ) were primarily technology - centric , 13 ( 33 % ) were primarily com - munity - centric , and eight ( 20 % ) were a blend of technology - centric and community - centric practices . Technology - centric research , as is evident in many of the ITID research articles , shows that exciting and potentially breakthrough technologies are being tested in developing communities . On the other hand , some authors were remarkably forthcoming about how their technology - centric research design contributed to the ICT project failing to meet a need or a goal . Patterson , Sim , and Aiyelokun’s ICT inter - vention can be considered a classic technology - centric failure : “We prototyped the wrong system and took it across the globe , ” and “ [ t ] o the degree that our original application was useless in the ªeld , we clearly failed to establish the right means of reaching our goal while working from afar” ( 2009 , p . 76 ) . Examples of approaches that appeared commu - nity - centric included the work of Best , Smyth , Etherton , and Wornyo , which examined mobile phone use in postconºict Liberia . The authors con - tended that the process of postconºict development required “an adequate understanding of the current uses and meanings of mobile telephony in that envi - ronment” ( 2010 , p . 93 ) . Wagner , Daswani , and Karnati reached a similar conclusion in their mother - tongue project in Southern India : “ICT - based pro - grams that do not pay sufªcient attention to the language , cultural , and attitudinal needs of the indi - vidual are likely candidates for failure in the near term” ( 2010 , p . 38 ) . Pal , Patra , Nedevschi , Plauché , and Pawar highlight the importance of understand - ing the potentially disruptive impact that rapid tech - nology infusion may have on a community . To mitigate that impact and avert failure , they propose “an incremental approach” ( 2009 , p . 62 ) to intro - ducing technology in classrooms , so as to not over - whelm novice technology users . They further advo - cate incorporating familiar and available “off the shelf” technology “instead of building new devices that require both expensive R & D and a greater threshold of arguing for adoption” ( ibid . ) . Community - centric approaches do not guarantee project success or failure . In some cases where the community was closely involved in the project and the ICT showed promise , external factors placed lim - its on successful project extension . For example , the article on the COMMONSense wireless sensor net - works project ( Panchard et al . , 2007 ) summarizes many of the common challenges associated with the introduction of experimental technology and prob - lems of scalability . The authors point out that it is difªcult to talk about demonstrable gains because the technology is “not yet widely available on the market” ( ibid . , p . 64 ) and it is not clear that the cost / beneªt analysis favors the investment . A number of studies highlighted the extent to which technology does not always result in positive development outcomes , regardless of whether a community - centric or technology - centric approach is taken . These types of “failures” remind us that sys - tems which appear to provide solutions can often be undercut by political , social , and economic dynamics lying outside the scope of the intervention ( Graham , 2010 ; Vasudevan , 2007 ) . The importance of working closely with partici - pants in developing communities to understand cul - tural nuances was stated in a number of research studies as a key factor that can positively affect ICTD outcomes . As was noted by Corbett and Keller ( 2004 ) , participatory GIS and community mapping exercises widened the power gap in the community by beneªting the already powerful and further marginalizing the less - educated . Corbett and Keller’s research also highlights potentially high - risk scenar - ios that can result from inappropriate introduction of ICTD projects , including open conºict , extortion , and sabotage . After witnessing anger , ill treatment , isolation , and resignation among community mem - bers , the authors perhaps understated the problems when they wrote that information systems “may heighten levels of disharmony” ( ibid . , p . 40 ) . Simi - larly , Medhi , Sagar , and Toyama’s ( 2007 ) study reminds us that PCs can engender fear and mistrust in novice users . Alampay and Bala’s ( 2010 ) study on mobile money transfers for the “bottom of the pyr - 26 Information Technologies & International Development CONSIDERING FAILURE amid” in the Philippines revealed low usage due to “mental barriers” and lack of motivation among users . These examples reveal the importance of working closely with community members and par - ticipants to identify problems and potentially address them effectively with ICT . A nuanced understanding of community dynamics , gained in a collaborative , consultative environment , helps to ensure project success if the information feeds back into the initia - tive , which appeared to be the case in some , but not all , of the ITID research reviewed . 4 . 6 Other Results Several other themes emerged from our review . First , many topics that can be considered important to developing communities were not mentioned in the ITID studies we reviewed , including climate adaptation and energy management , human rights and social justice issues , ICT access for persons with disabilities , and immigration and internal displace - ment . This is not an exhaustive list of social prob - lems ( in the developed or developing world ) , but the lack of published research in a highly regarded scholarly ICTD journal on these and other intractable problems was notable . Furthermore , we observed that , between 2003 and 2010 , ITID research was dominated by research conducted in India , where more than 30 % of the research projects were located . Sub - Saharan Africa , as a region , comprised 42 % of the sampled research . There were no projects from China or Rus - sia , and only one from Brazil , despite data showing that these large , populous countries face complex development challenges . Studies from the Carib - bean were absent . There were no studies from the Middle East , North Africa , or the Gulf states . Although the World Bank designates the Gulf states as high - or middle - income ( World Bank Statistics , n . d . ) , such designations obscure the fact that signiªcant portions of the population in those coun - tries are educationally , economically , and opportu - nity poor . The lack of published research ( in ITID and other development journals ) from some regions may be a result of issues such as government or legal controls that restrict research , the lack of historic academic collaboration , or funding priorities that target other under - resourced regions of the world . We highlight the lack of geographic diversity in ITID , but this issue is beyond the scope of this meta - analysis . 5 . Discussion We recognize the difªculties inherent in comparing projects that span a wide range of intervention pur - poses and scales , and we are cognizant of the com - plications involved in analyzing projects across a variety of countries , populations , technologies , and timeframes . It was not our goal to conduct a com - parative analysis , but to concentrate on features such as development objective , perspective , and focus that are common to any ICTD study , regard - less of purpose or scale . The range of studies reºected in the ITID litera - ture raises a number of important points for researchers and practitioners to consider , such as whether the goal of an ICT intervention is to spur intensive or extensive use . Those questions are wor - thy of consideration , particularly at the early stages of a study , when the development perspective is being formed . Furthermore , the conºict between conducting ICTD research and achieving develop - ment goals remains an unresolved issue . Similar to concerns raised within HCI4D ( Anokwa et al . , 2009 ) , ªeld - testing prototypes and experimental technolo - gies , while typical of the research cycle , do not nec - essarily dovetail with the goals of development projects that have sustainability and social change agendas . As is reºected in the ITID literature , the ICTD research community is not uniªed on how to harmonize the difªcult and sometimes competing goals of conducting experiments , producing social change , and studying the phenomena of ICT use in developing countries . Because the distinction between “doing development” and conducting research ( Anokwa et al . , 2009 ) is not altogether clear , confusion can contribute to both less - than - successful technology interventions and ambiguous research . We suggest that a careful consideration of the study’s objective , the perspective that guides the process , and the focus that informs the relationships among stakeholders can reveal the tensions between development and research . The extensive use of prototype technology and the lack of permanent installation or adoption are particularly important when attempting to establish trust relationships between participants and the ICTD academics or practitioners with whom they interact ( Anokwa et al . , 2009 ; Sterling & Rangaswamy , 2010 ) . The Global South is littered with the remnants of such projects , and communi - Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 27 DODSON , STERLING , BENNETT ties are justiªably jaded . Given that ICTD implemen - tation and intervention research projects ( at least as represented in these ITID articles ) are overwhelm - ingly proof - of - concept studies , long - term support should be factored into how researchers negotiate their relationship with communities participating in an ICTD study : The emphasis on conducting short - term research pilots , due to funding cycles and time constraints ( including product development and academic deadlines ) , demands greater responsibility on the part of the researcher to set target community ex - pectations about ICTD projects , especially those with an intervention agenda . ( Sterling & Rangaswamy , 2010 , p . 1 ) The negotiations that took place between research teams and participants for the projects examined are unknown , but it is hoped that the researchers attempted to establish “a fair , moral and candid relationship with the community to set expecta - tions” ( ibid . ) . The subtle interactions , both between culture and technology , and between user and technology , as discussed in the related works , are worthy of more attention . It is also important to study ICT integration processes with a more comprehensive understanding of how communities and individuals shape the use of—and are affected by—technolo - gies . There is ample room for further research into alternative ICT uses and user experimentation , all of which contribute to ICTD “success . ” Further , we need to be cognizant of potential community or individual conditions that have to be met prior to “development” taking place , i . e . , the psychological , economic , and sociocultural factors that must be in place at the start of a development initiative . Addressing these preconditions may reduce the high failure rates of these ICTD projects that collapse , are abandoned , partially or wholly fail to achieve their stated goals , or create signiªcant negative unin - tended consequences . We initially coded for adoption / non - adoption , a category that considered whether the research proj - ect had adoption as a goal , and whether the project was perceived to have achieved that goal . We found this to be an elusive pursuit , as the vast majority of initiatives were short - term , experimental introduc - tions of technology into communities where the technology was imported , temporarily installed , and removed upon completion . While short - term ªeld - testing often yields signiªcant and actionable ªndings , it is not conducive to measuring shifts in development metrics or witnessing social change , as short - term interventions do not have time to be scaled - up or replicated . Furthermore , we note that non - adoption does not always constitute failure . Nonetheless , we encourage researchers to be explicit about whether adoption is a goal , and when it is , to report their ªndings and reºections on whether this goal was achieved . Further , we were surprised that this set of ITID research studies referenced the Millennium Develop - ment Goals so rarely . This may suggest that ICTD interventions are not being designed to address a speciªc humanitarian goal as identiªed by the United Nations , but it also reminds us of the impor - tance of understanding development as a process , not solely as a predeªned goal . Additionally , the MDGs do not speciªcally focus on the relevance of ICTs to those priority problems in the developing world , which may discourage ICTD researchers from consulting the MDGs as they develop their research objectives . In the ITID research we studied , we did not ªnd a consistent set of organizing principles or metrics that were used in lieu of the Millennium Development Goals . 6 . Reporting Failures Our original goal was to identify commonalities among projects that succeeded in facilitating future success . This goal proved difªcult to achieve . We were better able to identify commonalities among failures and factors that potentially have a negative impact on an ICTD outcome . These factors were most evident in projects with highly top - down , tech - nology - centric approaches . We applaud those research teams who were forthright ( even fearless ) in reporting their mistakes and shortcomings . Such honesty beneªts the discipline as a whole by con - tributing to the knowledge base of both researchers and practitioners . Given the distressingly high failure rates in ICTD , reviewers in our ªeld should seek to identify and promote the reporting of the most use - ful of these failures . An example of this approach can be seen in Best and Kumar’s ( 2008 ) review of the challenges faced by the SARI telecenter project . The article identiªes a trifecta of ªnancial , institu - tional , and political failures that plagued the project . 28 Information Technologies & International Development CONSIDERING FAILURE Kothari , Pandey , and Chudgar’s ( 2004 ) study conªrmed that ICTD solutions often face paralyzing political barriers to their widespread installation and use . These realities serve to remind our community to temper our ardor for technology , which sometimes reaches the point of “technological utopianism” ( Toyama , quoted in Stross , 2010 ) , or “techno - fetishism” ( Best , 2010 ) . These fantasies do not well serve either our discipline or the communities with which we work . Acknowledging the signiªcant difference between a small - scale proof - of - concept study ( inter - vention ) and the roll - out of nationwide ICTD pro - grams , we believe there are important similarities among ICTD projects , regardless of intervention pur - pose and scale . These similarities concern the need for a more rigorous and disciplined approach to understanding “ground truths” within a country or community . Gathering relevant baseline data and engaging community members in the research agenda are ways to seek these “truths . ” We view the high failure rate in ICTD efforts as being symptomatic of the complexity of working in a multidisciplinary domain in often difªcult ªeld conditions . We appreciate that mixed results are not uncommon in the challenging , high - risk / high - reward circumstances in developing countries ( World Bank Group , 2012 ) . 6 . Conclusions This ITID literature review aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how information and com - munication technologies are chosen , designed , developed , and deployed to developing communi - ties . We sought to discover potential linkages among development goals and outcome objectives , top - down or bottom - up development perspectives , and assumptions about the relative importance of community and technology that can affect a pro - ject’s focus . Our goal is not to ªnd fault with our colleagues or their work . The goal of acknowledging and high - lighting strengths and weaknesses in research and practice is to advance the debate about the useful - ness of ICTD at a particularly important point in the history of the ªeld , as the discipline shifts from what Heeks calls ICTD 1 . 0 to ICTD 2 . 0 : “Where ICT4D 1 . 0 marginalized [ the poor ] , allowing a supply - driven focus , ICT4D 2 . 0 centralizes them , creating a demand - driven focus” ( 2009 , p . 29 ) . Our retrospec - tive examination of ICTD literature suggests that a predisposition toward “ICTD 1 . 0” endures in some areas of research . Admittedly , the papers chosen for publication in ITID do not represent fully the scope of research in the ICTD ªeld , nor do they represent fully the quality of research in the ªeld . Also , because the projects examined were all reported in one journal , any editorial positioning of that publica - tion is necessarily reºected in its contents . While this analysis only considered research published in ITID , it may be useful to apply this framework to research in related venues . Future work might investigate whether development perspective , objective , and focus are relevant indicators of success or failure in other development areas . Additional lines of inquiry might center on applying this assessment to the larger realm of ICTD policy , as it is widely under - stood that policy - level decisions often play a sig - niªcant role in setting the preconditions for success or failure . We did not speciªcally code for policy - level failures in this analysis , because such high - level considerations were generally outside the scope of research studies and technology interventions re - ºected in this corpus of ITID research studies . As a result of our analysis of 40 ITID case studies , we conclude that top - down , technology - centric , goal - diffuse approaches to ICTD contribute to unsat - isfactory development results . The growing invest - ment in , and implementation of , ICTs in developing communities presents an opportunity to examine less - than - effective practices , including our collective mistakes and negative outcomes . The poor do not beneªt when practitioners , agencies , NGOs , and governments “dump hardware down and hope magic will happen” ( Trucano , quoted in Strom , 2010 ) . Careful consideration of development objec - tives , perspective , and focus are essential in all phases of an ICTD project , from design to deploy - ment . Honest and comprehensive reporting of fail - ure and success can beneªt both the ICTD research community and the communities participating in ICTD initiatives . ■ References Abraham , R . ( 2007 ) .
