Errors in this process result in aneuploidy which can lead to cell death or oncogenesis . In this paper we describe a putative mammalian protein kinase , AIM - 1 ( Aurora and Ipl1 - like midbody - associated protein ) , related to Drosophila Aurora and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ipl1 , both of which are required for chromosome segregation . AIM - 1 message and protein accumulate at G 2 / M phase . The protein localizes at the equator of central spindles during late anaphase and at the midbody during telophase and cytokinesis . Overexpr - ession of kinase - inactive AIM - 1 disrupts cleavage furrow formation without affecting nuclear division . Furthermore , cytokinesis frequently fails , resulting in cell polyploidy and subsequent cell death . These results strongly suggest that AIM - 1 is required for proper progression of cytokinesis in mammalian cells . Keywords : Aurora / cleavage furrow / cytokinesis / Ipl1 / midbody Introduction Cytokinesis occurs at the ﬁnal stage of M phase and completes cell division . Mitosis is characterized by dra - matic morphological changes , which occur in a strictly sequential order and include cytoskeletal disassembly , breakdown of the nuclear envelope , chromosome con - densation , segregation and , ﬁnally , daughter cell separa - tion . In the last stage of cytokinesis actin , myosin and other cytoplasmic molecules are redistributed into the cleavage furrow which forms midway between the segreg - ated chromosomes in early anaphase ( Cao and Wang , 1990 ) . Actin – myosin interactions induce localized cortical contractions , which lead to an invagination of the plasma membrane in the cleavage furrow ( Fishkind and Wang , 1995 ) . Cytokinesis is accomplished by contraction of this actin ring and leads to separation of two daughter cells at the midbody . It remains to be shown how this last step is regulated . © Oxford University Press 667 Currently , the molecular basis of mitotic events is being studied extensively and some of these , such as entry into mitosis mediated by p34 cdc2 kinase and its associated cyclin subunits , are very well understood ( Nurse , 1990 ) . Protein phosphorylation has been suggested as an import - ant regulatory mechanism for the elaborate processes of M phase events and many phosphoproteins are known to be associated with elements of the mitotic apparatus such as microtubule organizing centers , kinetochores and the spindle midbody ( Davis et al . , 1983 ; Vandre et al . , 1984 , 1991 ; Westendorf et al . , 1994 ; Drewes et al . , 1997 ) . Various centrosomally localized protein kinases have been identiﬁed in vertebrate cells , including Cdc2 ( Bailly et al . , 1989 ) , Plk1 ( Golsteyn et al . , 1995 ) , Fyn ( Ley et al . , 1994 ) , Src ( David - Pfeuty et al . , 1993 ) and A kinase ( Nigg et al . , 1985 ) . Some of these might function as regulators of microtuble organization and spindle formation . Whether these protein kinases are directly or indirectly regulated by Cdc2 kinase is at present only poorly understood . Furthermore , it is unknown whether mechanisms mediated by protein phosphorylation are also involved in regulation of cytokinesis . Among these protein kinases the Drosophila serine / threonine protein kinase Aurora is known to be required for progression through M phase . Aurora was identiﬁed through recessive female sterile mutations , such that a mutant aurora mother would produce embryos in which centrosomes remained closely paired at inappropriate mitotic stages ( Glover et al . , 1995 ) . Loss of function of the protein kinase encoded by aurora leads to a failure of the centrosomes to separate and form a bipolar spindle . Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ipl1 kinase ( Francisco et al . , 1994 ) is highly homologous to Aurora . Loss of Ipl1 function results in chromosome missegregation and cell death . Moreover , in these cells the intensities of DNA staining located near the opposite ends of many elongated spindles are uneven , indicating that unequal numbers of chromosomes segregate to the two poles . These data suggest that Aurora and Ipl1 play important roles in cell division and chromosome segregation . Several protein kinases related to Aurora and Ipl1 are known in other species , like Xenopus XLP46APK and XLP46BPK and mouse STK - 1 ( Niwa et al . , 1996 ) . Aik / Ayk is a human homolog of Aurora and Ipl1 - related kinases ( Kimura et al . , 1997 ) . The levels of Aik / Ayk mRNA and protein are induced during G 2 / M and decrease rapidly after the end of mitosis . Aik / Ayk protein localizes at the spindle pole from prophase to anaphase . The data so far available for the Aurora and Ipl1 family members suggest that this molecule is evolutionally conserved and may be generally involved in M phase progression . In this paper we report the isolation of a putative rat protein kinase , AIM - 1 , which is highly related to Aurora and Ipl1 and describe its possible involvement Y . Terada et al . in cytokinesis . Immunolocalization experiments show that the AIM - 1 protein is found exclusively in the equatorial plane ( midzone ) in late anaphase and in the midbody in telophase . Overexpression of a dominant negative type of AIM - 1 affects formation of the cleavage furrow during late anaphase and leads to multinucleated cells . These data suggest that AIM - 1 function is relatively speciﬁc for cytokinesis and point to a key role for AIM - 1 in establishing the cleavage furrow as well as in the onset of cytokinesis . We discuss the role of AIM - 1 in cytokinesis in relation to other gene products with similar functions . Results Identiﬁcation and sequence of AIM - 1 We screened a NRK - 49F cDNA library using PCR for fragments encoding the VI – VII subdomain of serine / threonine - type protein kinases ( Otsu et al . , 1993 ) . The corresponding full - length clones of these 12 new cDNAs were isolated by screening the same library with these kinase cDNA fragments generated by PCR as probes . Subsequently , each of these cDNA inserts was subcloned into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector under control of the GAL1 / 10 promoter and introduced into wild type S . cerevisiae cells on a multicopy vector . Galactose - induced overexpression of one gene among these 12 putative protein kinases was growth inhibiting and large budded cells with 2N DNA content were formed . Therefore , we further characterized this gene , which might be involved in mammalian G 2 / M function . We named this new gene AIM - 1 ( Aurora and Ipl1 - like midbody - associated protein ) . The deduced amino acid sequence of AIM - 1 consisted of 344 amino acid residues and gave a calculated molecular mass of 39 . 2 kDa . When we searched the latest available databases AIM - 1 showed high homology to six serine / threonine - type protein kinases , STK - 1 , Aik / Ayk , XLP46APK , XLP46BPK , Aurora and Ipl1 . In comparison with these molecules we discuss the AIM - 1 protein struc - ture as subdivided into the following three domains : ( i ) an 80 residue N - terminal header sequence ; ( ii ) a catalytic domain containing the common protein kinase motifs ( 251 amino acid residues ) ; ( iii ) a 13 residue C - terminal tail with a putative destruction box ( Murray , 1995 ) . The multiple alignment of AIM - 1 with the six serine / threonine - type protein kinases is shown in Figure 1A . The kinase domain of AIM - 1 shares 76 , 73 , 71 , 60 and 46 % identity with those of XLP46APK , XLP46BPK , Aik / Ayk , Aurora and Ipl1 respectively . The N - terminal header domain of AIM - 1 , however , shows little homology with Aik / Ayk , XLP46APK , XLP46BPK , Aurora and Ipl1 . In contrast , human Aik ( Kimura et al . , 1997 ) / mouse Ayk share a substantial degree of sequence similarity with Xenopus XLP46APK and XLP46BPK , not only in the catalytic domain , but also in the N - terminal domain ( 29 and 29 % ) . As STK - 1 ( Niwa et al . , 1996 ) , which was identiﬁed in mouse embryonic stem cells , was almost completely homologous to AIM - 1 ( 93 % ) and the STK - 1 protein had a molecular mass similar to that of AIM - 1 , AIM - 1 appears to be a rat homolog of STK - 1 . Currently , except for Aurora , Ipl1 and Aik , the functions of these are not known . Amino acid sequence alignments of the kinase domains 668 of Aurora and Ipl1 - related kinases and other representative serine / threonine kinases were done using the Geneworks program and a hypothetical phylogenetic tree was drawn ( Figure 1B ) . In this phylogenetic tree Aurora and Ipl1 - related kinases were classiﬁed into a subfamily distinct from other kinases , including Cdk , Erk or Mek . This indicates that they are members of a unique ‘Aurora and Ipl1 - related kinase family’ and that these kinases are conserved evolutionarily from yeasts to mammals . In mammals there are at least two genes , according to differences in the N - terminal header domain : AIM - 1 / STK1 and Aik / Ayk . Tissue distribution AIM - 1 expression in various rat tissues was studied by Northern blotting with a cDNA fragment corresponding to the N - terminal header domain ( Figure 2A ) . This analysis detected a 1 . 8 kb AIM - 1 - speciﬁc mRNA predominantly in testis , spleen and lung . Expression was exceptionally high in testis . Together with the 1 . 8 kb band , another faint band of 4 . 0 kb was also always identiﬁed . This 4 . 0 kb message may be from alternative splicing , since in rat NRK - 49F cells this band showed the same cell cycle - speciﬁc oscillation pattern as the 1 . 8 kb band ( data not shown ) . Both AIM - 1 message and protein are expressed in the G 2 / M phase of the cell cycle Since Aurora and Ipl1 are required for chromosome segregation in M phase , we investigated whether the AIM - 1 expression pattern undergoes cell cycle - dependent oscillation . Poly ( A ) (cid:2) RNA was prepared from synchron - ized NRK - 49F cells at the indicated time points and analyzed by Northern blotting ( Figure 2B ) . AIM - 1 mRNA was most abundant 20 h after serum stimulation , indicating that the message was induced in late S phase , peaked near the G 2 / M transition and decreased rapidly at the next G 1 phase . In addition , M phase arrest by colcemid treatment induced a marked accumulation of AIM - 1 mRNA ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that AIM - 1 functions during M phase . To study the roles of this protein during M phase an antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C - terminal 13 amino acids of AIM - 1 was prepared ( Figure 1 ) . The results of Western blotting demonstrate the speciﬁcity of this antibody ( Figure 2C ) . The afﬁnity puriﬁed rabbit anti - AIM - 1 antibody N12 detects an ~ 41 kDa protein ( a slightly higher molecular weight than the predicted 39 . 2 kDa ) in protein extracts from colcemid - treated NRK - 49F cells ( lane 2 ) . AIM - 1 protein was identiﬁed exclusively in the insoluble fractions . This protein co - migrated with in vitro translated AIM - 1 prod - ucts ( lane 1 ) . It is noteworthy that the expression level of AIM - 1 in colcemid - arrested cells ( lane 2 ) was ~ 5 - fold higher than in asynchronous cells ( lane 3 ) . We next studied AIM - 1 protein level in NRK - 49F cells during cell cycle progression ( Figure 2D ) . Cells synchronized by serum starvation were harvested every 4 h after serum stimulation and extracts prepared . AIM - 1 began to accumulate at the S / G 2 boundary , reached maximum level in G 2 / M and decreased markedly in the next G 1 phase . Since serum - stimulated cells from G 0 may differ from continuously cycling cells , proteins AIM - 1 required for cytokinesis Fig . 1 . Comparison of Aurora and Ipl1 - related kinases from various organisms . ( A ) The predicted amino acid sequences of ﬁve Aurora and Ipl1 - related kinases are aligned for maximum homology . Amino acid numbers are shown on the left . Roman numbers above the amino acid sequences show the kinase subdomains as described by Hanks et al . ( 1998 ) and Hanks and Hunter ( 1995 ) . Residues identical to AIM - 1 are shown in black . The amino acid sequence comprising AIM - 1 subdomains VIb – VII is the region ﬁrst identiﬁed by PCR . The amino acid sequence marked with asterisks was used to prepare the anti - peptide antibody . The underlined short stretch of the AIM - 1 C - terminal amino acid sequence is the putative destruction box . ( B ) A hypothetical phylogenetic tree . The phylogenetic tree was drawn using the Geneworks program . xeXLP46APK , xeXLP46BPK , huAik , moAyk1 , raAIM - 1 , moSTK , drAurora and ScIpl1 indicate the members of the Aurora and Ipl1 - related kinase family from Xenopus , human , mouse , rat , Drosophila and S . cerevisiae respectively . Sp is S . pombe . prepared from cells synchronized by double thymidine block and release were prepared . Similar results were obtained ( data not shown ) . These data are consistent with the AIM - 1 mRNA levels . Due to the high insolubility we have not yet succeeded in measuring the kinase activity of this protein . Since the C - terminus of AIM - 1 contains the consensus motif for the putative destruction box ( Figure 1 ) , AIM - 1 might undergo 669 ubiquitin proteasome - dependent proteolysis , like other G 2 / M phase regulators such as cyclin B ( Glotzer et al . , 1991 ) and Cut2 ( Funabiki et al . , 1996 ) . AIM - 1 protein localizes to the midzone and the midbody To examine the involvement of this molecule in the mitotic machinery during cell cycle progression , asynchronously Y . Terada et al . Fig . 2 . AIM - 1 is transcriptionally controlled during G 2 / M phase . ( A ) Distribution of AIM - 1 mRNA in various rat tissues . A membrane ﬁlter with mRNAs ( 2 μ g ) from various rat tissues ( Clonetech ) was probed with 32 P - labeled N - terminal AIM - 1 DNA fragments . ( B ) AIM - 1 mRNA is induced in late S and peaks near the G 2 / M transition . Conﬂuent rat NRK - 49F cells were serum starved for 2 days . Cell cycle progression was started by replating the cells at a 1 : 3 ratio in serum - containing Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium . At each cell cycle time point 2 μ g poly ( A ) (cid:2) RNA were analyzed with an AIM - 1 cDNA probe . The control study was performed with a G3PDH gene probe ( Nippon Gene ) . FACS analysis data are shown as the percentage for each time point . ( C ) Speciﬁcity of the anti - AIM - 1 polyclonal antibody N12 . Aliquots of the product ( Promega ) of an in vitro transcription / translation reaction ( lane 1 ) , total insoluble protein from NRK - 49F cells arrested by colcemid treatment ( lane 2 ) and asynchronous NRK - 49F cells ( lane 3 ) were separated by SDS – PAGE , blotted onto nitorocellulose and incubated with 5 μ g / ml antibody N12 . ( D ) AIM - 1 protein is induced during G 2 / M phase . Cell cycling was initiated under the same conditions as described in ( B ) . Aliquots of the total insoluble protein corresponding to 2 (cid:3) 10 5 cells at each time point were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti - AIM - 1 antibody N12 . As a control an aliquot of an in vitro transcription / translation reaction product of AIM - 1 was used . Table I . Effect of kinase - inactive AIM - 1 on cell division Plasmid Cell lineage NRK - 49F ( % ) a KD ( % ) Mv1Lu ( % ) (cid:2) doxycycline – doxycycline Vector 0 . 4 ( 1 / 232 ) b 0 . 6 ( 1 / 156 ) 0 . 4 ( 1 / 241 ) 0 . 7 ( 2 / 282 ) AIM - 1 ( WT ) 7 . 8 ( 18 / 231 ) 4 . 8 ( 8 / 168 ) 0 . 9 ( 2 / 216 ) 3 . 0 ( 7 / 230 ) AIM - 1 ( K - R ) 62 . 0 ( 161 / 260 ) 38 . 2 ( 68 / 178 ) 7 . 7 ( 20 / 261 ) 67 . 0 ( 156 / 233 ) AIM - 1 ( WT ) , AIM - 1 ( K - R ) or pEF / hyg I as a control vector was co - transfected with a reporter construct RSV – β - galactosidase into NRK - 49F cells or KD cells . Cells were ﬁxed 72 h after transfection and analyzed by microscopy . Expression of β - galactosidase was visualized as described in Materials and methods . The conditions used for Mv1Lu cells were as indicated in Figure 4B . a The number shown is the percentage of cells with more than two nuclei . For NRK - 49F or KD cells this was calculated based on the number of cells co - expressing β - galactosidase . For Mv1Lu cells this was calculated based on the total number of cells counted . b Number of cells displaying the phenotype / total number of cells carrying plasmids . growing NRK - 49F cells were immunocytochemically studied with antibody N12 . In interphase no obvious AIM - 1 signal was detected ( Figure 3A ) . However , spindle 670 staining became visible as cells progressed through pro - phase , concomitant with concentration of AIM - 1 in the pericentriolar material , while in metaphase AIM - 1 became AIM - 1 required for cytokinesis dispersed in the cytoplasm ( Figure 3B and C ) . In late anaphase AIM - 1 began to be detectable as a distinct wide band extending across the midzone of the central spindle ( Figure 3D ) . As the cells progressed to telophase and cytokinesis AIM - 1 became more sharply concentrated at the midbody ( Figure 3E and F ) . Virtually identical results were obtained when we induced FLAG – AIM - 1 fusion protein under tight control of a tetracycline - inducible system ( Gossen and Bujard , 1992 ) in mink lung epithelial ( Mv1Lu ) cells ( Figure 3G ) . Mv1Lu cells were transfected with both a construct with the tetracycline repressor fused to the activating domain of herpes simplex virus transcriptional activator VP16 and a construct containing the FLAG – AIM - 1 cDNA under control of the tetracycline operon regulatory elements . This system allows expression of the desired protein only after depletion of doxycycline , a tetracycline analog , but not in the presence of the drug . Immunodetection of the induced FLAG – AIM - 1 with anti - FLAG antibody demon - strated that FLAG – AIM - 1 localized correctly to the mid - body , suggesting that anti - AIM - 1 antibody N12 speciﬁcally recognizes AIM - 1 in cell immunostaining . Since γ - tubulin is identiﬁed in the midbody and micro - tuble organizing centers ( Julian et al . , 1993 ; Shu et al . , 1995 ) , we also determined the subcellular localization of γ - tubulin in FLAG – AIM - 1 - expressing Mv1Lu cells . As shown in Figure 3G , FLAG – AIM - 1 protein and γ - tubulin co - localized at the midbody . These data suggest that the appearance of AIM - 1 protein in mitotic cells coincides precisely with the kinetics of protein expression shown by the Western blot data ( Figure 2C ) and that AIM - 1 might regulate the process from anaphase to telophase / cytokinesis . Induction of kinase - inactive AIM - 1 causes abortive cytokinesis In order to understand the role of AIM - 1 during mitosis we examined the effects of kinase - inactive FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) , in which the lysine residue of the ATP site at position 109 was replaced by arginine ( Hanks et al . , 1988 ) , to block function of the endogenous AIM - 1 protein in a dominant negative manner . Cells carrying vector alone , wild - type FLAG – AIM - 1 ( WT ) or FLAG - AIM - 1 ( K - R ) were grown in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 24 h and then subjected to Western blotting with anti - FLAG antibody ( Figure 4A ) . In the presence of 2 μ g / ml doxycycline the basal levels of FLAG – AIM - 1 ( WT ) or FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) in exponentially growing cells were similar to the levels seen in cells transfected with vector alone . The expression of FLAG – AIM - 1 was rapidly induced after doxycycline removal ( Figure 4A ) . On Western blots these bands migrated slightly slower than those of the endogenous AIM - 1 when detected with anti - AIM - 1 antibody ( data not shown ) . When FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) was induced for 72 h , ~ 67 % of the cells failed to complete normal cytokinesis and they had more than two nuclei [ FLAG AIM - 1 ( WT ) : 3 % ] ( Figure 4B ) . In addition , the size of these cells was much larger than that of normal cells ( Figure 4B and D ) . In these abnormal cells , however , spindle functions , including chromosome disjunction and late anaphase spindle elongation , as well as nuclear division appeared unaffected ( data not shown ) . These results were conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence - activated 671 cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis ( Figure 4C ) . When ethanol - ﬁxed cells were analyzed , cell populations with 4N or 8N DNA content increased dramatically 72 h after induction of FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) , coinciding with the appearance of binucleate or tetranucleate cells . Cells expressing FLAG – AIM - 1 ( WT ) or cells transfected with vector alone dis - played normal cell cycle division patterns ( Figure 4C ) . Additionally , we analyzed preparations of these cells by time - lapse video microscopy . The induction of AIM - 1 ( K - R ) caused the cells to arrest in or delay mitosis for a prolonged period ( Y . Terada , unpublished results ) . Most of the cells failed to establish a cleavage furrow and eventually became binucleate . To test the generality of this observation , AIM - 1 ( WT ) or AIM - 1 ( K - R ) constructs were co - transfected transiently with RSV – β - galactsosidase ( at a ratio of 10 : 1 ) into either rat NRK - 49F cells or human diploid ﬁbroblast KD cells . The β - galactosidase expression plasmid served as a positive internal control for successful expression of transfected DNA . Transfection of the vector alone did not affect cell cycle progression , but transfection of the AIM - 1 ( K - R ) construct resulted in accumulation of binucleate cells ( Table I ) . However , transfection of AIM - 1 ( WT ) also caused abortive cytokinesis at a low level . These data suggest that expression of this protein at a proper level and / or timing is required to accomplish normal cytokinesis . The nuclei of FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) - expressing cells could divide three to four times over a 4 – 5 day time period , resulting in (cid:4) 10 nuclei / cell ( Figure 4D ) . Subsequently , however , these multinucleate cells did not divide further and failed to adhere to the plate . Indeed , when we tested cell growth in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 2 weeks to investigate the effects of AIM - 1 ( K - R ) on viability , the growth of Mv1Lu cells expressing AIM - 1 ( K - R ) but not AIM - 1 ( WT ) was inhibited ( Figure 4E ) . These ﬁndings suggest that AIM - 1 function is essential for cell viability . Discussion We have identiﬁed a putative rat protein kinase , AIM - 1 , related to Drosophila Aurora and S . cerevisiae Ipl1 , both of which are known to be required for chromosome segregation . Cell cycle analysis shows that AIM - 1 protein is induced periodically in G 2 / M , suggesting that cell cycle oscillation of AIM - 1 protein level is regulated predominantly in a transcriptional fashion around M phase . In addition , levels of AIM - 1 protein decline sharply at the end of M phase . This might be due to degradation of the protein through the presumptive ubiquitination destruction box in the C - terminal tail of AIM - 1 . Immunolocalization studies demonstrate that AIM - 1 protein undergoes rapid redistribution during M phase . AIM - 1 localizes at the spindle poles in prophase , redistributes to the spindle midzone in late anaphase and ﬁnally becomes even more sharply concentrated at the midbody region as late ana - phase progresses into telophase . Overexpression of putative kinase - inactive AIM - 1 in a tetracycline - inducible system leads to a failure of cyto - kinesis , which is consistent with the markedly increased numbers of multinucleate cells with 4N or 8N DNA content . To explain this observation we suggest that kinase - negative AIM - 1 competes with endogenous AIM - 1 for Y . Terada et al . 672 AIM - 1 required for cytokinesis the midzone and midbody binding sites , thus reducing the amount of functional AIM - 1 at the midzone and midbody . These lines of evidence strongly indicate that AIM - 1 is required for the onset of cytokinesis . This hypothesis is also supported by the ﬁnding that AIM - 1 localizes at the midzone and the midbody . Moreover , immunoﬂuorescent staining with anti - α - tubulin , DNA staining and FACS analysis of multinucleate cells revealed that normal bipolar spindles are formed and normal nuclear division occurs in cells depleted of AIM - 1 function . These data suggest that AIM - 1 participates speciﬁcally in regulation of cyto - kinesis . Nevertheless , since the centrosome in prophase is immunologically stained with AIM - 1 antibody , AIM - 1 might be involved in other functions during M phase . Fig . 4 . Induction of kinase - inactive AIM - 1 abrogates cytokinesis . ( A ) Induction of wild - type FLAG – AIM - 1 ( WT ) or kinase - inactive FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) in Mv1Lu cells . The cells were cultured for 24 h after doxycycline ( DOX ) removal . Lysates were immunobloted with anti - FLAG mAb ( M2 ) . ( B ) Overexpression of kinase - inactive AIM - 1 leads to multinucleate cells . Asynchronous cells were transfected with vector alone , FLAG – AIM - 1 ( WT ) or FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) , and grown with or without doxycycline for 72 h . Cells were subsequently stained with Giemsa solution . Cells expressing FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) had more than two nuclei , which are the clear areas ( arrow ) surrounding the dark dots of nucleoli . ( C ) FACS analysis demonstrates the increased DNA content after expression of kinase - inactive AIM - 1 . Cells were harvested as described in ( B ) . For FACS analysis cells were ﬁxed with ethanol and stained with propidium iodide . ( D ) Multinucleate cells induced by AIM - 1 ( K - R ) expression . Double staining for α - tubulin ( green ) and DNA ( red ; propidium iodide ) was displayed by superimposing the respective images of Mv1Lu cells expressing FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) as described in ( B ) . AIM - 1 ( K - R ) expression induced the appearance of abnormal cells each containing two ( a ) , four ( b ) , eight ( c ) or more than 10 nuclei ( d ) after doxycycline removal . α - tubulin was detected with anti - α - tubulin mAb and FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Cappel ) and the signals observed by confocal laser microscopy ( Fluoview , Olympus ) . ( E ) AIM - 1 function is essential for cell viability . Mv1Lu cells transfected with FLAG – AIM - 1 ( WT ) or FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) were grown with or without doxycycline for 2 weeks and stained with Giemsa solution . Fig . 3 . AIM - 1 localizes to the midzone and the midbody . NRK - 49F cells were stained with anti - AIM - 1 polyclonal antibody ( left column ) , anti - α - tubulin mAb ( middle column ) and Hoechst 33258 for DNA staining ( right column ) : ( A ) interphase ; ( B ) prophase ; ( C ) metaphase ; ( D ) late anaphase ; ( E ) telophase ; ( F ) cytokinesis . ( G ) Co - localization of FLAG – AIM - 1 with γ - tubulin during cytokinesis . Mv1Lu cells carrying pUHD 10 - 3 / FLAG – AIM - 1 ( WT ) were grown without doxycycline for 24 h and stained with anti - FLAG mAb M2 , rabbit anti - γ - tubulin antibody and Hoechst 33258 . Scale bar 10 μ m . 673 These conclusions are , however , in contrast to the fact that aurora mutations show abnormal mitotic spindles due to failure of the centrosomes to separate and form bipolar spindles ( Glover et al . , 1995 ) . Conditional expression of a kinase - negative AIM - 1 did not affect formation of normal bipolar spindles and chromosome segregation . This suggests that AIM - 1 might simply be related to Aurora rather than a true functional homolog . Recently Aik ( Aurora / Ipl1 - related protein kinase ) / Ayk was identiﬁed as a candidate for a mammalian homolog with Aurora func - tion ( Kimura et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , Aik appears to play an important role for centrosome separation ( Kimura et al . , personal communication ) . These data suggest that Aik / Ayk is a true functional homolog of Aurora and that Y . Terada et al . it plays a major role in mammalian centrosome separation . Aik mRNA and protein are low in G 1 / S , accumulate during G 2 / M and decrease rapidly after mitosis . Its protein kinase activity is also enhanced in mitosis , as inferred by phosphorylation of exogenous casein . These Aik character - istics are very similar to those of AIM - 1 , but there is a difference between these two kinases . AIM - 1 localizes at the midzone during anaphase and at the midbody during telophase , but Aik does not . This difference in localization could be explained by the different N - terminal header domain sequences between AIM - 1 and Aik . The character - istic N - terminal header domain of AIM - 1 is most likely responsible for association of AIM - 1 protein with the midbody structure . This indicates that there are at least two genes in the mammalian Aurora and Ipl1 - related kinase family : Aik is involved in establishment of the spindle pole body and AIM - 1 plays a crucial role in regulating cytokinesis . Spindle functions such as centrosome separation and initiation of cytokinesis are reported to be regulated by kinesin - like proteins ( KLPs ; Goldstein , 1991 ; Moore and Endow , 1996 ) . In Schizosaccharomyces pombe the cut7 (cid:2) gene , which encodes a spindle - associated KLP , is required for spindle pole body separation ( Hagan and Yanagida , 1990 ) . In a cut7 mutant microtubles nucleated from spindle pole bodies fail to interdigitize with one another . Drosophila KLP - 61F , which is a member of the bimC / Cut7 (cid:2) / Eg5 family ( Enos and Morris , 1990 ; Hagan and Yanagida , 1990 , 1992 ; Le Guellec et al . , 1991 ) , is reported to be required for centrosome segregation ( Heck et al . , 1993 ) . The phenotypes of the KLP - 61F and aurora mutations show strikingly similar abnormalities of the centrosomes ( Glover et al . , 1995 ) , thus suggesting that they might play regulatory roles in a common process and that the Aurora kinase might be involved in KLP - 61F function to regulate kinesin motor activity . Recently KLP - 3A , another member of the Drosophila KLP family , is reported to be a component of the midbody and to be required for central spindle assembly as well as initiation of cytokinesis during meiotic division in males ( Williams et al . , 1995 ) . The phenotype of KLP - 3A mutations , which leads to the appearance of spermatids containing multiple nuclei , resembles the AIM - 1 loss - of - function phenotype and KLP - 3A and AIM - 1 show similar intracellular distri - butions . Therefore , AIM - 1 might regulate a mammalian KLP - 3A homolog in cytokinesis , whereas Aik might control a member of the KLP - 61F / bimC / Cut7 (cid:2) / Eg5 family . A number of proteins have been found to relocate from various parts of the spindle to the midzone during telophase , including Inner Centromere Protein ( INCENP ; Cooke et al . , 1987 ) and Telophase Disc 60 ( TD60 : Andreassen et al . , 1991 ) . The behavior of these proteins suggests that they may contribute to the signaling of cytokinesis ( Wheatley and Wang , 1996 ; Eckley et al . , 1997 ) . Whether AIM - 1 has close functional relationships with these proteins to complete cytokinesis remains to be shown . In Drosophila another protein kinase , Polo , has been described as being involved in M phase progression ( Fenton and Glover , 1993 ) . Mutations in polo result in a high frequency of abnormal mitoses and aberrant chromo - some segregation in larval neuroblasts . These cells fre - quently display hypercondensed chromosomes , monopolar 674 spindles and disorganized spindle poles , leading to poly - ploidy . The mammalian M phase - speciﬁc protein kinase Plk1 , which is related to Polo , is cell cycle regulated and peaks during late G 2 phase . Immunolocalization studies show that Plk1 localizes at the spindle pole during prophase and metaphase , redistributes to the equatorial regions of the spindle during anaphase and concentrates within the midbody ( Golsteyn et al . , 1995 ; Lee et al . , 1995 ) . These features of Polo and Plk1 are similar to those of AIM - 1 , though neither kinase is structurally homologous to AIM - 1 . Plo1 , a S . pombe functional homolog of Polo , is another important regulatory molecule involved in cytokinesis ( Ohkura et al . , 1995 ) . Loss of Plo1 affects both actin ring formation and deposition of septal material and overexpression of Plo1 can trigger septation from any point in the cell cycle . These results suggest that ﬁssion yeast Plo1 kinase plays a dual role in both establishment of a bipolar spindle and in septum formation . Whether mammalian Plk1 performs equivalent functions in cyto - kinesis is currently unclear . Interestingly , Plk1 localizes not only at the centrosome but also at the midzone and the midbody , as does AIM - 1 . This suggests that mammalian Plk1 might have the same dual functions as ﬁssion yeast Plo1 . If Plk1 is involved in control of mammalian cytokinesis , there might be interactions between Plo1 and AIM - 1 during cytokinesis . Nuclear division and cytokinesis are normally coordin - ated in the cell cycle and cytokinesis occurs exactly after completion of nuclear division . This implies the existence of a checkpoint control that suppresses the onset of cytokinesis before completion of nuclear division . Since in cells without normal AIM - 1 function cytokinesis is dissociated from nuclear division , it is likely that AIM - 1 coordinates cytokinesis with the mitotic events of the cell cycle . If this is the case , several questions would arise as to whether AIM - 1 kinase is activated normally just after completion of nuclear division and what mechanisms exist to perform cytokinesis in the signaling system transduced by this kinase . To solve these questions we need to understand better how the actin ring is formed and how its contraction in cytokinesis is regulated . However , the kinase activity of AIM - 1 has not yet been successfully determined due to its insolubility . In summary , our data provide the ﬁrst evidence that the novel serine / threonine - type kinase AIM - 1 is essential for cytokinesis . Our results suggest a role for this protein in coordinating cytokinesis with the mitotic events of the cell cycle . However , at present little is known about the molecular events upstream or downstream of AIM - 1 at the last stage of cell division . Further analyses of the signaling cascade which AIM - 1 propagates could help clarify how the onset of cytokinesis is regulated relative to completion of nuclear division . Materials and methods AIM - 1 cDNAs and expression plasmids Full - length AIM - 1 cDNAs were isolated from a rat NRK - 49F cDNA library ( Terada et al . , 1995 ) . A kinase - inactive ( K - R ) mutant allele of AIM - 1 was generated by site - directed mutagenesis using PCR . In AIM - 1 ( K - R ) the critical lysine ( K ) at position 109 in the putative ATP binding site was mutated to arginine ( R ) . An N - terminal FLAG tag was added by PCR to full - length AIM - 1 ( WT ) and AIM - 1 ( K - R ) and they were subcloned into vectors pUHD 10 - 3 ( Gossen and Bujard , 1992 ) and pEF / AIM - 1 required for cytokinesis hyg I ( with the EF1 α promoter and hygromycin - resistance marker ; Terada et al . , 1995 ) respectively . These plasmids were transfected into Mv1Lu cells ( ATCC ) carrying pUHD 15 - 1 ( Gossen and Bujard , 1992 ) either with the pEF / Hyg I vector ( as a selection marker ) for pUHD 10 - 3 constructs or alone for pEF / Hyg I constructs , using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer’s recommendations ( Gibco - BRL ) . Clones were selected with hygromycin ( 0 . 2 mg / ml ; Calbiochem ) in the presence of doxycycline ( 2 μ g / ml ; Sigma ) and those in which FLAG – AIM - 1 ( WT ) or FLAG – AIM - 1 ( K - R ) was induced 24 h after doxycycline depletion were chosen for further analysis . The expression of FLAG - tagged AIM - 1 proteins was detected by Western blotting with anti - FLAG mAb ( M2 ; Kodak ) . A clone carrying the empty vector alone was used as a control . Antibodies For preparation of a polyclonal antibody against AIM - 1 ( N12 ) a peptide located at the C - terminus of AIM - 1 ( HPWVRANSRRVLPPSAL ) was synthesized , coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits . To obtain the anti - AIM - 1 antibody , a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – AIM - 1 C - terminus fusion protein was produced in bacteria . The antibody was puriﬁed from whole serum using GST – AIM - 1 C - terminus on an afﬁnity column . Cell extract preparation Cells were extracted with RIPA buffer ( 10 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 % NP - 40 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂouride , 4 mg / ml leupeptin ) , followed by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 h . The pellets were suspended in SDS – PAGE sample buffer , boiled and sonicated . The supernatant after centrifugation at 10 000 g was treated with SpinBind ( FMC ) to deplete contaminating DNA fragments . Cell immunostaining Cells grown on Labtek chamber slides ( Nunc ) were pretreated with a microtubule stabilizing buffer ( MSB ; 80 mM potassium PIPES , pH 6 . 8 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and then ﬁxed with methanol ( 10 min at – 20°C ) as described by Boleti et al . ( 1996 ) . Fixed cells were washed with a solution of 0 . 1 M PIPES , pH 7 . 2 , 1 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 . 83 % L - lysine , 1 % BSA and 0 . 1 % sodium azide and were subsequently incubated for 1 h with a monoclonal mouse anti - α - tubulin mAb 7 - 5168 ( 1 μ g / ml ) ( Sigma ) and afﬁnity puriﬁed rabbit AIM - 1 antibody ( N12 ) ( 5 μ g / ml ) ( for Figure 3A – F ) or mouse anti - FLAG mAb ( M2 ) ( 1 μ g / ml ) and rabbit anti - γ - tubulin antibody ( at 1 : 600 dilution ) ( Masuda and Shibata , 1996 ) ( for Figure 3G ) . This was followed by incubation with FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG antibody ( Cappel ) and rhodamine - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG anti - body ( Cappel ) . The stained cells were observed with conventional ﬂuorescent ( Nikon ) or confocal laser microscopes ( Fluoview , Olympus ) . β - galactosidase cytochemistry To visualize expression of the reporter enzyme β - galactosidase trans - fected cells on glass coverslips were ﬁxed in 1 . 25 % glutalaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 5 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS . Cells were then stained in X - gal buffer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 2 . 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide , 2 . 5 mM potassium ferricyanide , 15 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mg / ml X - gal ) for 2 – 4 h .
