1592 T here has long been interest in the metabolic pathways occurring in platelets and their relationship to function . Despite their reliance on crude analytic tools and inhibi - tors , early studies showed that platelets must produce ATP to maintain functionality . 1 Platelet activation leads to a sig - nificant increase in glucose uptake , glycolysis , and lactate production , 2 – 5 suggesting that , in addition to oxidative phos - phorylation , glycolysis is a significant producer of ATP to fuel platelet function . Electron microscopy studies clearly show that platelets contain glycogen granules , which could serve as a reservoir for energy production . Glucose can also be imported from the outside through 3 classes of facilitative transporters ( glucose transporters [ GLUTs ] , sodium GLUTs , and sugars will eventually be exported transporters ) . 6 , 7 These proteins facilitate the transmembrane movement of glucose down a concentration gradient of either glucose or sodium . 6 Platelets contain at least 2 members of the GLUT family of uniporters , GLUT1 and GLUT3 . 8 , 9 Although GLUT1 may account for basal uptake of glucose in resting cells , GLUT3 has drawn attention because it is mobilized from α - granules to the plasma membrane on platelet activation ( Figure 1 ) . 4 , 5 In this issue , Fidler et al 9 used a platelet - specific knockout of GLUT3 to probe its role and , thus , the roles of regulated glu - cose uptake , in platelet function . See accompanying article on page 1628 GLUT3 was originally posited as a neuronal - specific GLUT that maintained cytoplasmic levels of the neuron’s preferred fuel . 10 Subsequently , it was detected on sperm , and studies of GLUT3 knockout mice showed it is globally required for embryogenesis . 11 GLUT3 is unique , having the lowest K m and highest V max of the 4 major GLUTs ( 1 – 4 ) ; thus , it has a high transport capacity even at lower glucose con - centrations . 12 Localized to the plasma membrane in neurons and sperm , GLUT3 exists in an intracellular pool in certain blood cells , for example , lymphocytes , macrophages , neutro - phils , and platelets . 11 It is from this intracellular pool that it is mobilized to the plasma membrane on activation , 4 , 5 much like GLUT4 is mobilized in adipose and muscle cells on insulin treatment . Fidler et al 9 created mice lacking GLUT3 in platelets and megakaryocytes . Megakaryocytes from these mice showed no overt defects , and platelet numbers were unaffected , sug - gesting that GLUT3 was not required for platelet production . Although the mice had no defect in the tail bleeding assay of hemostasis , there were mild but significant defects in the autoimmune / inflammatory arthritis model and some protec - tion in the collagen / epinephrine pulmonary embolism model . In vitro , GLUT3 − / − platelets produced normal microparticles in response to thrombin and collagen but were defective in spreading and clot retraction . Aggregation was also defective but only at low agonist concentrations , and the defects were resolved when agonist was increased . These data show a role for GLUT3 in platelet function but suggest that the transporter is not absolutely required because no assays showed a com - plete ablation of function . Secretion from GLUT3 − / − platelets was only partially affected . ATP release and exposure of CD63 were unaffected but the release of PF4 , IL1 α , and exposure of CD62 were , suggesting that release of dense granule cargo did not require GLUT3 but that α - granule content release did . Because dense granules are thought to be docked to the plasma membrane , they may not require extra ATP generation for membrane fusion . 13 Ultrastructural analysis of α - granules showed that activated GLUT3 − / − platelets had more decondensed granules relative to wild type . Thus , membrane fusion occurred , but the cargo was not effectively dissolving or being extruded from the granules . This suggests that GLUT3 supplies the fuel for fusion pore expan - sion 14 or an active extrusion of granule content . Alternatively , GLUT3 may transport polyol glucose into the concentrated granule cores to promote solubilization of α - granule contents . Future studies will be needed to address these points . Secretion from the GLUT3 − / − platelets had a distinctive time course that suggested 2 sources of glucose may fuel dif - ferent stages of α - granule secretion . Consistently , glycogen levels rapidly decreased at the initial time points , suggesting that glycogenolysis was important in the early stages of acti - vation . To address this , Fidler et al 9 blocked glycogen phos - phorylase and slowed the rate of secretion but did not affect its final extent in wild - type mouse and human platelets . Similar treatment of GLUT3 − / − platelets decreased both the initial rate and extent of P - selectin exposure . These data imply a role for glycogenolysis in the early stages of platelet activation and glucose influx , via GLUT3 , at later stages . Although these data show that differential mobilization of fuel sources is important for platelet function , a simple interpretation is com - plicated by the fact that GLUT3 − / − platelets had lower resting levels of glycogen . Given that GLUT3 transports glucose bidirectionally in response to a glucose gradient , does GLUT3 on α - granules Fueling Platelets Where Does the Glucose Come From ? Sidney W .

Heijnen et al 4 showed that ≈ 85 % of GLUT3 was on α - granules in resting cells . Although α - granules could simply be the depot for GLUT3 , Fidler et al 9 suggest GLUT3 might facilitate glycolysis and ATP genera - tion in α - granules ( Figure 1 ) . Consistent with this concept , proteomics studies have detected glycolytic enzymes in plate - let releasates . 15 Fidler et al 9 show some association of hexo - kinase and lactate dehydrogenase with a α - granule fraction , although the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in that fraction was low . Perhaps more compelling , the production of [ 13 C ] lactate in saponin - permeabilized , cytosol - depleted platelets decreased by 2 . 5 - fold in the GLUT3 − / − platelets when fed [ 13 C ] glucose . However , because of difficulties in isolating intact α - granules , a true smoking gun demonstration that α - granules catalyze glycolysis is lacking . Future experiments in this area will assuredly be exciting . Does ATP generation truly occur inside α - granules and is that ATP contributing to platelet energetics ? Alternatively , is that pool of ATP fueling intragranular phosphorylation or perhaps ecto - phosphoryla - tion reactions outside the platelet ? 16 However , given the ATP released from dense granules , it is unclear how much more α - granules can contribute to the microenvironment around an activated platelet . How does GLUT3 affect platelet function ? Based on the data presented in Fidler et al , 9 the answer may be subtle . GLUT3 does account for the stimulation - dependent influx of glucose seen in activated platelets , confirming previous work . 4 , 5 This glucose influx is used to fuel spreading , clot retraction , and the sustained phase of α - granule secretion but perhaps not its initial steps . The enzymatic properties of GLUT3 make it ideal for efficiently transporting glucose when in a thrombus core where diffusion is restricted . 17 Thus , its mobilization to the surface offers a mechanism to fuel clot retraction and other late stages of thrombosis . In a broader sense , Fidler et al 9 expand a new chapter in platelet energetics where the tools of metabolomics and genetically modified mice are used to ask specific questions about how platelets power thrombosis and hemostasis . Such future studies will yield important insights into normal platelet function and perhaps an understanding of the dysfunctions associated with metabolic pathologies , such as diabetes mellitus .

Although GLUT1 resides on the plasma membrane ( PM ) , GLUT3 is present mainly in the α - granules of resting platelets and is mobilized to the PM on activation . There , GLUT3 promotes increased glucose influx which fuels the generation of ATP and , thus , platelet function , through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria and glycolysis in the cytosol . Given the increase in glucose , much of the pyruvate produced by glycolysis in activated platelets seems to end up in lactate production . by gu e s t on A ugu s t 30 , 2017 h tt p : / / a t vb . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 1594 Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol September 2017 glucose transporter GLUT - 3 from alpha - granules to the cell surface .
