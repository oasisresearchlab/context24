While recent advances in tumor vaccines and T cell - based immunotherapies appear promising , tumor tolerance and immune suppression remain formidable obstacles to eradicating breast cancer [ 2 ] . It is widely believed in the field of metastasis that tumor cells must acquire multiple genetic alterations to enable colonization in distant organ sites [ 3 ] . Of these , evasion of host immune surveillance is an early and critical step . Cancer cells , like bacteria and viruses , are known to evolve a number of strategies to escape immune surveillance [ 4 , 5 ] . For example , cancer cells have been documented to downregulate or alter MHC class I molecules and their presentation of tumor antigens to escape immune surveillance , a process known as immunoediting [ 6 , 7 ] . Identifying critical genetic alterations that enable immune evasion and tumor tolerance will facilitate the development of immunotherapies that eliminate breast cancer . In order to identify potential gene signatures for metastasis using our syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer metastasis , we compared low - metastatic TM40D breast cancer cells with the highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells by microarray [ 8 ] . This revealed a number of immune response genes altered between these cells that were not identified in previous arrays using immune deficient xenograft mouse models [ 9 ] . Of these , a significant downregulation was found in the TM40D - MB cells of the cd1d1 gene , encoding the MHC class I - like molecule CD1d . CD1d molecules present glycolipid antigens to a specialized class of immune cells known as natural killer T ( NKT ) cells [ 10 ] . NKT cells can be divided into two main types : Type I NKT cells , or invariant NKT ( iNKT ) cells , are characterized by an invariant TCR a chain consisting of V a 14J a 18 gene segments in mice ( V a 24J a 18 in humans ) and can promote either Th 1 or Th 2 effector responses , depending on their activation [ 11 , 12 ] . Type II PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20702 NKT cells are a heterogeneous class of CD1d - restricted cells with a diverse TCR repertoire , and have mainly immune regulatory functions [ 13 ] . In cancer , accumulated evidence points to a protective role for type I ( iNKT ) cells , whereas type II NKT cells have been shown to be mainly immunosuppressive [ 14 ] . Clinically , iNKT levels are significantly reduced in solid tumors , and low levels of circulating iNKT cells correlate with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers , including breast cancer [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ] . Multiple preclinical and clinical studies support the notion that inducing iNKT cell activation can inhibit tumor progression and promote lasting tumor immunity [ 19 , 20 ] . Activated iNKT cells can rapidly produce pro - inflammatory cytokines such as IFN - c , which activates innate natural killer ( NK ) effector function and induces maturation of dendritic ( DC ) cells that produce immune - stimulating IL - 12 [ 21 ] . This leads to activation of secondary immune effector responses , including maturation of CD8 + T cells to antigen - specific antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) [ 22 , 23 ] . In addition to their role in activating antitumor NK and T effector function , iNKT cells can induce direct cytolysis of tumor cells [ 24 ] . Activated iNKT cells have been demonstrated to be directly cytotoxic to CD1d - bearing tumor cells in a CD1d - dependent manner in vitro , and studies have directly correlated tumor expression of CD1d to their sensitivity to iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity in vivo [ 25 , 26 ] . CD1d is widely expressed in humans and animals in both hematopoietic and non - hematopoietic cells , including multiple tumor types [ 27 , 28 ] . CD1d downregulation by human papillo - mavirus ( HPV ) in infected cervical epithelial cells has been recently shown to be correlated with their progression to cervical carcinoma [ 29 ] . Downregulation of CD1d in highly metastatic breast cancer cells may similarly enable evasion of immune surveillance and facilitate metastatic progression . To date , no study has directly linked CD1d expression by breast cancer cells and iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity in preventing breast cancer metastasis . In this study , we provide the first evidence that in human breast cancer cells , downregulation of CD1d expression is correlated with increasing metastatic potential . Using our syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer metastasis , we show that tumor cells expressing CD1d promote increased iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity in a CD1d - dependent manner in vitro and in vivo . Importantly , inhibition of tumor CD1d expression in vivo , by either antibody blockade or gene silencing , promotes spontaneous breast cancer metastasis . Interestingly , by comparing tumor growth of CD1d - expressing and CD1d - deficient tumor cells in NKT - deficient transgenic knockout ( KO ) models , we have uncovered important differences in the regulation of these cells by type I and type II NKT cells . These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for CD1d - restricted NKT cells in regulating breast cancer metastasis . In addition , these results point to the CD1d expression status of the tumor as being an important determinant in tailoring NKT - based immunotherapies for the prevention and treatment of metastatic breast cancer . Our findings further support research into designing breast cancer immunotherapies that bolster the activation of type I NKT cells , while inhibiting the suppressive functions of type II NKT cells . Materials and Methods Mice Inbred BALB / c mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc . BALB / c mice homozygous deficient in the cd1d1 gene ( CD1d KO ) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory [ 30 ] . Recombinase - activating gene 2 - deficient ( RAG2 KO ) BALB / c mice were purchased from Taconic Laboratories [ 31 ] . J a 18 KO ( iNKT deficient ) on the BALB / c background ( at least 8 gen - erations backcrossed by Ram Singh , UCLA ) mice were provided by Dr . Randy R . Brutkiewicz ( Indiana University School of Medicine , Indianapolis , IN ) [ 32 ] . All mice were housed in a pathogen - free environment at the Northwestern Center for Comparative Medicine ( CCM ) facility . All experiments were done in accordance with protocols approved by the CCM Committee on Animal Care ( CAR ) institutional IACUC and in accordance with AAALAC . Female mice approximately 8 weeks old were used for all experiments . Breast cancer cell lines TM40D mammary tumor cells were derived from the FSK4 mammary epithelial cell line established in vitro from normal mouse mammary gland [ 33 ] . TM40D - MB tumor cells were isolated from bone by antibiotic selection after intracardiac injection of TM40D cells , according to a modified method by Li et al [ 34 ] . TM40D tumors have a low potential for spontaneous lung and bone metastasis after orthotopic mammary gland implantation ( 7 . 7 % ) , whereas TM40D - MB tumors are metastatic to lung and highly bone metastatic ( 53 . 3 % ) [ 8 ] . The TM40D - shCD1d cell line was created by stable lentiviral knockdown of TM40D cells with a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) sequence against murine cd1d1 ( pLKO . 1 vector , clone ID 67863 , OpenBiosystems ) . A scrambled shRNA was also used as a control ( TM40D - scr ) . All cells were grown in DMEM / F12 supplemented with L - glutamine , 50 m g / ml strepto - mycin , 50 U / ml penicillin and 5 % heat - inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) ( all Invitrogen Gibco BRL ) . All cells were used within two weeks of culture ( passages 4 – 6 ) . In vivo orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer metastasis For all tumor experiments , mice were injected bilaterally into the 4 th mammary fat pads with 1 6 10 6 tumor cells . Tumor volume measurements were taken every three days , and tumor volume was calculated using the formula : length 6 width 2 / 2 [ 35 ] . Mice were euthanized at the point at which tumors reached the maximum allowable size of 2 cm , following AAALAC guidelines and the rules set by the IACUC . In order to detect spontaneous lung metastasis , tissues were fixed with Bouin’s fixative for 24 hrs , then replaced with 70 % EtOH [ 36 ] . After 48 hrs , tissues were visualized and photographed under a dissecting light microscope with attached camera ( Olympus SZX12 , Olympus America Inc ) . For the in vivo anti - CD1d blocking antibody study , 10 mice were implanted with 1 6 10 6 tumor cells . At the point tumors were palpable ( day 10 post - implantation ) , 5 mice per group were administered 200 m g i . p . of anti - CD1d ( 3C11 ) blocking antibody or vehicle ( hybridoma supernatant ) control [ 37 ] . These injections were repeated at days 17 , 24 and 31 post - tumor implantation , and tumor measurements were taken every three days . At day 45 , all mice had reached the maximum allowable tumor size and were subsequently euthanized . Real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) assay To validate the microarray results , RNA was harvested from tumor cell lines ( Rneasy kit , Qiagen ) and RT - PCR was performed on reverse - transcribed cDNA ( Roche ) using primers for the murine cd1d1 gene , and L19 amplification was used as a control for relative levels of total RNA , as previously described [ 38 ] . For real - time RT - PCR experiments , the SYBR Green assay ( Applied Biosystems ) NKT - Mediated Antitumor Immunity in Breast Cancer PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20702 was used for detecting products from the isolated complementary DNA samples on a real - time cycler ( ABI7900HT , Applied Biosystems ) . Reactions for each sample were performed in triplicate , and amplified products were visualized on an agarose gel . The level of target gene expression was normalized against glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) expression in each sample . For RT - PCR of the human CD1D transcript , the following cell lines were used : 71N , 81N – normal human mammary epithelial cells , 21PT , ZR - 75 - 1 – non - invasive primary tumor , MCF - 7 – minimally invasive primary tumor , MDA - MB - 468 , MDA - MB - 231 – pleural effusion , highly metastatic [ 39 , 40 ] . RNA was harvested ( Trizol , Sigma ) and reverse - transcribed to make cDNA ( Superscript II , Invitrogen ) . The following primers were used to amplify a 275 bp fragment from the human CD1D gene : 5 9 - CGC GCA GCG GCG CTC CGC G - 3 9 located in exon 1 , and 5 9 - GGA CCA AGG CTT CAG AGA G - 3 9 located in exon 2 . Primers for human GAPDH were used as described previously [ 41 ] . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis At maximum tumor size , spleen and tumor were excised and homogenized to obtain single cell suspensions , and erythrocytes were removed as described [ 42 ] . To test for immune cell recruitment in spleen and tumor , 2 6 10 6 cells from each sample were preincubated with anti - CD16 / CD42 ( 2 . 4G2 , eBioscience ) to avoid non - specific binding of antibodies to Fc c R [ 43 ] . Cells were stained with the following fluorophore - conjugated anti - mouse monoclonal antibodies : anti - CD1d ( 1B1 ) , anti - TCR b , anti - CD49b ( DX5 ) , anti - CD4 , anti - CD8 a , anti - CD69 , anti - CD45R ( all BD Biosciences ) , and CD1d tetramers loaded with the a GalCer analog PBS - 57 ( NIH Tetramer Core Facility , Atlanta GA ) . The percentage of live cells was assessed using the LIVE / DEAD fixable violet blue cell kit ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were sorted using a FACS Canto II ( BD Biosciences ) and analyzed on FlowJo software ( Tree Star ) . Enrichment of iNKT cells and in vitro cytotoxicity assay iNKT cells were enriched from splenocytes of healthy , unchal - lenged 7 week - old wildtype BALB / c by positive selection as previously described [ 42 ] . Dead cells were removed from splenocytes using a Dead Cell Removal Kit ( MACS , Miltenyi Biotec ) . To debulk splenocytes of B cells , splenocytes were incubated with biotin - B220 ( BD Biosciences ) , followed by streptavidin microbead magnetic column depletion ( MACS , Miltenyi Biotec ) . For positive selection of iNKT cells , splenocytes were incubated with a PE - conjugated PBS - 57 - loaded CD1d tetramer , followed by anti - PE magnetic column purification ( MACS , Miltenyi Biotec ) . Percent enrichment and activation status ( CD69 + ) of iNKT cells isolated from splenocytes was confirmed by FACS . Activated iNKT - enriched splenocytes were immediately incubated with target tumor cells at effector to target ( E : T ) ratios of 5 : 1 , 10 : 1 and 25 : 1 , in the presence or absence of anti - CD1d ( 3C11 , BD Biosciences ) , or IgM isotype control ( Sigma ) [ 44 ] . After 4 hr incubation at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 , cell - free supernatants were harvested and assayed for lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) activity as a measure of cell lysis ( LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit , Roche ) [ 45 ] . Spontaneous release of LDH by effector and target cells were controlled by separate incubations of these populations . The results were calculated as follows : % Cytotoxicity = test release – non - specific release x 100 total LDH release – non - specific release Statistical analysis Results are expressed as the median and range and mean 6 standard deviation . Student’s paired t tests or one - way ANOVA were used to determine statistical significance . A value of P , 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Data were analyzed using Excel for Mac 2008 ( Microsoft ) and Prism 5 ( GraphPad ) . Results CD1d expression is correlated with increasing metastatic potential in murine and human breast cancer cells Several lines of evidence support the idea that a small population of primary tumor cells possess existing molecular signatures for metastasis [ 46 , 47 ] . In order to identify potential metastatic signatures using our mouse model of breast cancer metastasis , TM40D breast cancer cells of low metastatic potential were compared to the highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells by microarray [ 8 ] . Among the genes that were found differentially expressed between these two cell lines , we found a 4 . 72 - fold downregulation of the cd1d1 gene in the TM40D - MB cells . ( Figure S1 ) . This expression difference was validated by real - time RT - PCR , comparing amplified cDNA for the murine cd1d1 gene by RT - PCR between the TM40D and TM40D - MB cells ( Fig . 1A ) . Downregulation of surface CD1d expression in the TM40D - MB cells was also confirmed by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) ( Fig . 1B ) . CD1d is known to be expressed in human breast tissue , in both ductal epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells [ 48 ] . Downregulated CD1d expression has been correlated with decreased iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity in several human and murine hematopoietic malignancies [ 24 , 25 , 49 ] . In human solid tumors , a correlation of downregulated CD1d expression with increasing malignancy has been reported in malignant glioma , and most recently HPV - transformed cervical carcinoma cells [ 29 , 50 ] . In order to assess the importance of CD1d downregulation in human breast cancer , we analyzed a panel of human mammary epithelial cell lines of increasing metastatic potential by RT - PCR for their expression of CD1d ( Fig . 1C ) . CD1d was found to be expressed in normal human mammary epithelial cells , and with the exception of MDA - MB - 468 , is downregulated in the transition from normal to malignant breast cancer . These results suggest that downregulation of CD1d expression in both murine and human breast cancer may be an important mechanism for evading tumor immune surveillance and promoting metastatic cancer progression . CD1d - expressing tumor cells promote direct iNKT - mediated cytotoxicity in a CD1d - dependent manner in vitro Previous studies in hematopoietic tumors demonstrated the ability of CD1d - expressing tumors to be susceptible to direct iNKT - mediated cytolysis in a CD1d - dependent manner [ 25 , 26 , 51 ] . However , the ability of iNKT cells to induce direct cytolysis of CD1d - expressing breast cancer cells has not been reported . For this experiment , activated iNKT effector cells were enriched from splenocytes by positive selection using a ligand - conjugated CD1d tetramer [ 42 ] ( Fig . 2A ) . Activation of iNKT cells by tetramer ligation was positively confirmed by increased expression of CD69 , a marker for iNKT activation [ 52 ] . Enriched iNKT cells were immediately incubated with either TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) or TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) tumor target cells and assayed for tumor cytolysis . TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) tumor cells demonstrated increased cytotoxicity over TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) tumor cells in a range of effector to target cell ratios , and significantly higher cytotoxicity at an E : T ratio of 25 : 1 ( P , 0 . 05 ) , as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ( Fig . 2B ) . This suggests that enriched iNKT cells may preferentially target tumor cells expressing higher levels of CD1d , and downregulation of CD1d may be a mechanism for NKT - Mediated Antitumor Immunity in Breast Cancer PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20702 evading direct iNKT - mediated cytotoxicity . Additionally , we show that direct iNKT cytolysis of TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) cells could be partially blocked by the addition of an anti - CD1d blocking antibody ( 3C11 ) in a range of effector to target cell ratios ( Fig . 2C ) . The ability of the anti - CD1d antibody to block tumor cytolysis was concentra - tion - dependent , as compared to isotype control ( Fig . 2D ) . These results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating suscep - tibility of CD1d - expressing hematopoietic tumor cells to direct iNKT - mediated cytolysis , and the ability of anti - CD1d blocking antibody to partially abrogate this effect [ 26 , 51 ] . To our knowledge , this is the first study to demonstrate the ability of enriched iNKT cells to induce direct cytolysis of CD1d - expressing breast cancer cells in a CD1d - dependent manner in vitro . Downregulation of CD1d by tumor correlates with evidence of decreased iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity in vivo The ability of CD1d - restricted iNKT cells to promote antitumor immune responses has been documented in multiple human and animal cancer studies [ 14 , 19 , 20 ] . Several studies have demonstrated a direct role for CD1d - expressing tumor cells in activating iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity [ 24 , 25 ] . Activated iNKT cells have been shown to prime innate NK immune responses , as well as activate secondary immune effector antitumor CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [ 22 , 23 ] . We hypothesize that downregulation of CD1d in breast cancer cells may inhibit iNKT - regulated primary and secondary immune responses . In order to assess the effects of tumor downregulation of CD1d on iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity in vivo , we utilized our mouse model of breast cancer metastasis to compare the immune responses of mice implanted with either low metastatic TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) cells , or highly metastatic TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) cells . For this experiment , TM40D or TM40D - MB cells were implanted into wildtype BALB / c and monitored for tumor progression . TM40D - MB tumor cells with downregulated CD1d expression were found to grow at a slower rate than TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) tumors , suggesting that downregulated CD1d expres - sion may not affect tumor proliferation directly ( Fig . 3A ) . In order to assess potential effects of downregulated CD1d expression by tumor on innate and adaptive antitumor immunity , we assessed spleens from tumor - implanted mice for levels of iNKT , NK , Figure 1 .

As a control , these cell populations were compared to spleen from healthy ( unchal - lenged ) mice . Splenocytes isolated from the TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) group demonstrated lower levels of NK and iNKT cells as compared to healthy unchallenged mice , as expected from immune suppression at this late stage of tumor progression ( Fig . 3B , C ) . Importantly , splenic levels of NK and iNKT cells of the TM40D mice were significantly higher than in the TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) group ( NK and iNKT P , 0 . 001 ) , although tumor sizes were comparable at time of analysis . This suggests that downregulation of tumor CD1d expression may have an effect on NK and iNKT antitumor immunity , even at a late stage in tumor progression . Both the TM40D and TM40D - MB tumor groups had decreased splenic levels of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations as compared to unchallenged mice , although the reduction in the TM40D - MB group was significantly more pronounced ( CD4 + P = 0 . 003 , CD8 + P = 0 . 012 ) ( Fig . 3B , D ) . These results suggest that secondary T cell - mediated adaptive antitumor immunity may also be compromised by downregulated CD1d expression . In summary , these data point to a correlation between downregulated CD1d expression by tumor and sup - pression of iNKT - regulated antitumor immunity in vivo . In vivo antibody blockade of CD1d in mice bearing CD1d - expressing tumors promotes spontaneous breast cancer metastasis Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of in vivo anti - CD1d antibody blockade to inhibit tumor progression of CD1d - deficient tumors [ 37 , 53 , 54 ] .

Based on our in vitro findings , we hypothesized that in vivo blockade of CD1d using an anti - CD1d blocking antibody would inhibit iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity and result in increased breast cancer metastasis . To test this , wildtype BALB / c mice were implanted with 1 6 10 6 TM40D tumor cells . At the point at which tumors were palpable ( day 10 post tumor implantation ) , mice were injected intraperitoneally ( i . p ) with either anti - CD1d ( 3C11 ) blocking antibody , or vehicle control [ 37 ] . Unlike the anti - CD1d ( 1B1 ) blocking antibody used by the Smyth group , anti - CD1d ( 3C11 ) is a non - depleting blocking antibody that is not known to activate antitumor APCs [ 55 ] . Antibody injections were repeated weekly , and mice were euthanized at maximum tumor volume . Unlike previous studies using antibody blockade of CD1d - deficient tumors , treatment of CD1d - expressing TM40D cells with anti - CD1d blocking antibody did not inhibit tumor growth ( Fig . 4A ) . In order to assess the effect of CD1d antibody blocking on tumor metastasis , we evaluated whether anti - CD1d antibody blockade could increase tumor metastasis to lung . Previous studies in our lab demonstrated that TM40D tumors have a low rate of spontaneous metastasis [ 35 ] . As assessed by histology , tumors in mice treated with the anti - CD1d antibody exhibited increased ability to metastasize to lung , with significantly increased numbers of tumor foci per lung ( P = 0 . 0049 ) ( Fig . 4B , C ) . Thus , unlike other CD1d - deficient tumors , treatment of CD1d - expressing breast tumors with an anti - CD1d blocking Figure 3 .

For this experiment , we employed lentiviral delivery of shRNA against murine CD1d ( TM40D - shCD1d ) . Knockdown of CD1d expression level in TM40D cells was verified by real - time RT - PCR , which demonstrated CD1d expression levels in TM40D - shCD1d cells to be downregulated to a level comparable to TM40D - MB ( Fig . 5A ) . FACS analysis of TM40D - shCD1d surface expression of CD1d demonstrated a similar decrease , as compared to TM40D and TM40D - MB cells ( Fig . 5B ) . When TM40D - shCD1d cells were implanted into BALB / c mice , primary tumor growth rates were found to be identical to the parental TM40D - implanted mice ( data not shown ) . Importantly , when spleens were harvested from these mice and assessed for levels of iNKT - mediated immune populations , TM40D - shCD1d mice demonstrated significantly decreased splenic levels of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells ( CD4 + P = 0 . 017 , CD8 + P = 0 . 034 ) , as well as significantly decreased iNKT cells ( P = 0 . 003 ) , as compared to parental TM40D - implanted mice ( Fig . 5C ) . NK levels were not significantly affected ( data not shown ) . This supports the notion that downregulation of tumor CD1d expression may play a role in suppressing the antitumor immune functions of iNKT cells . In addition , we analyzed these groups for evidence of lung metastasis , and found a significantly increased rate and frequency of lung foci per lung in the TM40D - shCD1d ( P = 0 . 0152 ) mice , as compared to parental TM40D - implanted mice ( Fig . 5D ) . These results demonstrate the importance of tumor - specific CD1d expression for inhibiting metastatic breast cancer progression , and point to the importance of iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity in regulating these tumors .

CD1d - lo tumors by CD1d - restricted NKT cells Recent studies have begun to elucidate a novel immunoregu - latory axis of CD1d - restricted NKT cells , with type I invariant NKT ( iNKT ) having antitumor functions , and type II variant NKT cells demonstrating mainly immunosuppressive tumor - promoting abilities [ 14 ] . The role of CD1d - restricted type I vs . type II NKT cells in breast cancer has only been addressed using the CD1d - deficient 4T1 mammary carcinoma model [ 37 ] . The ability of CD1d - restricted NKT cells to regulate tumor growth and metastasis of CD1d - expressing breast tumors has yet to be explored . To address this , we compared tumor growth and metastasis rates of TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) or TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) cells implanted in wildtype mice , CD1d KO mice that are deficient in all CD1d - restricted NKT cells , and J a 18 KO mice that are deficient in only type I NKT ( iNKT ) cells [ 30 , 32 ] . Additionally , we sought to determine the importance of adaptive immunity in regulating tumor growth and immune responses between these tumors using recombinase - activating gene 2 deficient ( RAG2 KO ) mice , lacking all B and T lymphocytes , including NKT cells [ 31 ] . For these experiments , we first compared rates of tumor growth and metastasis of TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) cells implanted in wildtype , CD1d KO , J a 18 KO and RAG2 KO mice . Tumor growth rates were found to be similar between wildtype and immune - deficient mouse groups ( Fig . 6A ) . These results are in line with previous observations in the CD1d - deficient 4T1 breast cancer mouse model [ 37 ] . In contrast to rates of tumor growth , significant differences were found between these mouse groups in their ability to spontaneously metastasize to lung ( Fig . 6B , D ) . TM40D cells were most metastatic in RAG2 KO mice , lacking adaptive immune NKT , T and B lymphocytes , but maintaining NK cell innate immune functions . These results suggest that innate NK - mediated antitumor immunity is not sufficient to inhibit spontaneous metastasis , and adaptive immune lymphocytes are the primary effector cells in our model . Next we addressed the role Figure 6 . Differences in tumor growth and metastasis between TM40D and TM40D - MB tumors in normal and immune deficient mice .

As compared to TM40D in wildtype , the rate of metastasis and overall number of metastases per lung in TM40D - implanted CD1d KO mice was significantly higher ( P = 0 . 0077 ) . These results demonstrate the importance of CD1d - restricted NKT cells in regulating metastatic progression of CD1d - expressing tumors . We predicted that TM40D tumors implanted in type I NKT - deficient J a 18 KO mice would show similar rates of metastasis as compared to CD1d KO mice , owing to the importance of type I NKT cells in antitumor immunity . Surprisingly , we found a more significant increase in the rate and frequency of lung metastases in TM40D - implanted CD1d KO mice than in the J a 18 KO mice ( P = 0 . 0164 ) . These results establish the importance of adaptive immunity and CD1d - restricted NKT cells in preventing metastatic cancer progression of CD1d - expressing tumors , but do not directly implicate the importance of type I NKT cells in this model . In order to determine the importance of CD1d - restricted NKT cells in regulating the immunity of tumors with downregulated CD1d , TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) tumors were also implanted in wildtype , CD1d KO , J a 18 KO and RAG2 KO mice . In contrast to TM40D tumor growth in these mice , growth of TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) cells varied dramatically between mouse groups ( Fig . 6C ) . Unlike the TM40D tumors that readily grew in CD1d KO mice , TM40D - MB tumors did not grow at all in these mice ( Fig . 6B , C ) . These results were similar to those observed in CD1d - deficient tumor models ( 15 - 12RM , CT26 - L5 ) , where CD1d KO mice are highly resistant to tumor growth [ 37 ] . This suggests that the presence of suppressive type II NKT cells in these tumors may be more important in promoting tumor progression than the absence of type I NKT cells . Accordingly , we would expect TM40D - MB tumors to be able to grow and metastasize in J a 18 KO mice lacking only type I NKT cells . As predicted , TM40D - MB tumors grew in J a 18 KO mice , although tumor growth rates were on average slower than in wildtype mice ( Fig . 6C ) . Interestingly , in RAG2 KO mice deficient in all adaptive lymphocytes , including NKT cells , TM40D - MB tumor growth rates were significantly increased as compared to wildtype ( P = 0 . 0127 at day 42 post tumor implantation ) , and similar to the rate of TM40D in wildtype . These results are in line with previous studies demonstrating increased rates of tumor growth in RAG2 KO mice , owing to the importance of adaptive antitumor immunity [ 56 ] . Next we assessed the ability of TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) tumors to metastasize to lung in these mice , as compared to TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) . While no tumor growth or metastasis was detected in CD1d KO mice implanted with TM40D - MB , J a 18 KO mice demonstrated a similar ability to metastasize to lung as compared to wildtype , with increased number and size of lung tumor foci , although this was not statistically significant ( P = 0 . 1877 ) ( Fig . 6B , D ) . Similar to TM40D , all of the RAG2 KO mice implanted with TM40D - MB tumor cells readily metastasized to lung , and the overall number of lung metastases for both groups were significantly greater than in wildtype mice ( P , 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 6B , D ) . These findings further implicate the role of adaptive immune lymphocytes for preventing breast cancer metastasis in our tumor model . The results of these experiments point to potential differences in the ability of type I and type II NKT cells to regulate antitumor immunity in CD1d - expressing vs . CD1d - deficient tumors . Discussion The ability of CD1d - restricted iNKT cells to promote antitumor immune responses has been documented in multiple human and animal cancer studies [ 14 , 19 , 20 ] . Several tumor types have been shown to express CD1d , and tumor expression of CD1d has been directly correlated with the ability of iNKT cells to induce direct tumor cytolysis in vitro and promote iNKT - mediated tumor immunity in vivo [ 25 , 51 ] . To our knowledge , this is the first study to address the role of CD1d expression and NKT - mediated antitumor immunity in regulating breast cancer metastasis . In our mouse model of breast cancer metastasis , we detected a significant downregulation of CD1d in the highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells , as compared to the low - metastatic TM40D cells . We hypothesized that tumors may acquire a selective advantage by downregulating expression of CD1d , thereby evading iNKT - mediated immune surveillance and promoting metastatic cancer progression . The exact mechanisms of iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity have yet to be fully elucidated , however iNKTs are known to have both direct and indirect effector functions , including the ability to activate both innate NK and adaptive T cell - mediated antitumor immunity [ 22 , 23 , 24 ] . In our study , we show that downregulation of CD1d in highly metastatic cells correlates with in vivo suppression of iNKT - regulated immune effector cells , as evi - denced by significantly decreased in vivo levels of iNKT , NK , CD4 + and CD8 + T cells . The effect on iNKT immune suppression was not attributed to differences in tumor burden , as all mice were euthanized at the same tumor volume . In addition , while gene knockdown of CD1d in TM40D cells had no effect on primary tumor growth , mice implanted with these tumors demonstrated significantly decreased splenic levels of iNKT and T effector cells and a significant increase in spontaneous lung metastasis . These results point to the importance of CD1d expression by tumor in promoting iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity . In addition to their indirect antitumor immune functions , multiple studies confirm the ability of iNKTs to be directly cytotoxic to tumor cells in a CD1d - dependent manner [ 24 , 25 , 26 ] . In this study , we demonstrated that enriched iNKT cells are preferentially cytotoxic to breast cancer cells with increased CD1d expression in vitro , and this effect could be partially abrogated by the addition of anti - CD1d blocking antibody . Previous studies by the Smyth group reported potent tumor inhibition by administer - ing an anti - CD1d blocking antibody in mice bearing multiple types of CD1d - deficient tumors , presumably by blocking the suppressive functions of type II NKT cells [ 37 , 53 , 54 ] . As these studies were conducted using CD1d - deficient tumors , it was unknown whether similar effects could be achieved with CD1d - expressing tumors . As demonstrated in our study , treatment of mice bearing CD1d - expressing breast tumors in vivo with an anti - CD1d blocking antibody did not inhibit tumor progression , but instead significantly increased spontaneous lung metastasis . The importance of CD1d expression by tumor was further validated by shRNA knockdown of CD1d , which also demonstrated signifi - cantly increased tumor metastasis to lung . These results highlight a previously unrecognized role for tumor CD1d expression in preventing spontaneous breast cancer metastasis , and provide further evidence to support the direct cytotoxic effector role of iNKT cells in antitumor immunity . Previous studies in a MCA - induced fibrosarcoma model reported only a minor contribution of direct iNKT antitumor cytotoxicity in vivo [ 57 ] . In our study , we did not see direct evidence of iNKT cytotoxicity in vivo as evidenced by the ability of iNKT cells to affect tumor growth rate . Our highly metastatic TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) tumor cells actually grow slower than TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) cells , both in vitro ( unpublished data ) and in vivo , and modulation of tumor CD1d expression by either antibody blockade or gene knockdown had no effect on primary tumor NKT - Mediated Antitumor Immunity in Breast Cancer PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 10 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20702 growth . This may be attributed to an already high tumor burden from the large number of transplanted tumor cells , where direct iNKT effector functions may be quickly overwhelmed . Interest - ingly , while very few iNKT cells remained in the tumor microenvironment at the time of tumor harvest , the majority of iNKT cells that remained were CD4 2 / CD8 2 double negative ( DN ) ( data not shown ) , indicative of increased cytotoxic ability [ 58 ] . Recent studies performed in the murine prostate TRAMP model demonstrated that CD1d - positive TRAMP prostate tumor cells could induce cytokine defects in tumor - infiltrating DN iNKT cells [ 59 ] . CD1d - expressing cancer cells in the primary breast tumor may provoke similar defects in iNKT function . Alterna - tively , as TM40D tumor cells were able to metastasize to lung in a CD1d - dependent manner , it is possible that the direct cytotoxic functions of DN iNKT cells may be more important in targeting circulating tumor cells , rather than decreasing primary tumor burden . Further studies are required to more fully characterize the direct vs . indirect cytotoxic functions of iNKT cells in preventing spontaneous breast cancer metastasis . In order to assess the relevance of these findings to human breast cancer , we analyzed the expression of CD1d in several human mammary cell lines of increasing metastatic potential by RT - PCR . We provide the first evidence that expression of CD1d in human mammary epithelial cells is lost in the transition from normal to invasive breast cancer . However , not all metastatic cell lines lost CD1d , as evidenced by the highly metastatic MDA - MB - 468 cells . Interestingly , these cells were originally acquired from an African - American patient , while the equally metastatic MDA - MB - 231 cells were acquired from a Caucasian patient [ 60 ] . Differences in genetic variation of CD1d haplotypes between these ethnicities has been previously reported , and possible alternate slicing or expression of CD1d between ethnicities is possible [ 61 ] . These findings may have important clinical implications in tailoring individual NKT - based immunotherapies for the treatment of breast cancer . Treatment with an anti - CD1d blocking antibody may be effective for CD1d - deficient tumors , however CD1d - expressing tumors would likely be more responsive to iNKT - activating therapies . Studies in multiple murine tumor models have demonstrated that type I ( iNKT ) and type II NKT cells have opposing regulatory roles , with type I NKT cells demonstrating potent antitumor immune responses , and type II NKT cells exhibiting mainly immunosuppressive functions [ 14 ] . Type I NKT dominant tumors , such as 4T1 mammary carcinoma and CT26 colon carcinoma , have been shown to grow similarly in CD1d KO ( type I and II deficient ) and J a 18 KO ( type I deficient ) mice as in wildtype , but demonstrate increased metastasis in J a 18 KO mice [ 37 ] . In these models , the presence of type I NKT cells is the dominant factor in preventing metastasis , regardless of the presence or absence of suppressive type II NKT cells . In contrast , type II NKT dominant tumor models , such as subcutaneous 15 - 12RM fibrosarcoma and CT26 - L5 colon carcinoma , grow normally in J a 18 KO mice but do not grow at all in CD1d KO mice , highlighting the requirement of suppressive type II NKT cells in promoting tumor progression of these cells . Importantly , all of these tumor models are CD1d - deficient , and the role of CD1d - expressing tumors in promoting a type I vs . type II NKT immune response in non - hematopoietic tumors has not previously been investigated . In a murine model of B cell lymphoma , CD1d - expressing tumor cells demonstrated increased tumor progression in J a 18 KO mice as compared to CD1d - deficient tumor cells [ 51 ] . This was suggested to be due to the ability of CD1d - expressing tumor cells to recruit suppressive type II NKT cells in the absence of type I NKT cells . Also in this model , CD1d KO mice were highly resistant to tumor progression of both CD1d - expressing and CD1d - deficient tumor cells , suggesting a dominance of suppressive type II NKT cells . In order to elucidate the specific roles of CD1d - restricted NKT cells in our model of breast cancer , we utilized CD1d KO ( type I and type II NKT cell deficient ) , J a 18 KO ( type I NKT cell deficient ) and RAG2 KO ( B and T cell deficient ) mice to compare tumor growth and metastasis rates between our CD1d - lo and CD1d - hi tumor cells . Our TM40D ( CD1d - hi ) tumors grew at the same rate in all mouse strains , similar to the type I NKT dominant 4T1 mouse model [ 37 ] . However , while the CD1d - deficient 4T1 - implanted CD1d KO mice exhibited fewer metastases and increased survival as compared to J a 18 KO mice , our CD1d - expressing TM40D tumor cells showed the opposite effect , with significantly increased metastasis in the CD1d KO mice as compared to J a 18 KO mice . Similarly , while the Smyth group was able to inhibit 4T1 metastatic growth by in vivo anti - CD1d antibody blockade , our TM40D cells demonstrated significantly increased metastasis upon in vivo antibody blockade . As antibody blockade of CD1d - expressing tumors would similarly abrogate direct type II NKT recruitment , our TM40D cells may not be able to recruit type II NKT cells , as suggested in the B cell lymphoma study [ 51 ] . Clearly , both tumor and systemic expression of CD1d are important for preventing metastasis of TM40D tumors . However , the specific contributions of type I and type II NKT cells in regulating these tumors , as compared to other adaptive immune cells , cannot be concluded at this time . In order to directly assess the role of type I vs . type II NKT cells in regulating CD1d - deficient tumors in our tumor model , we implanted TM40D - MB ( CD1d - lo ) tumors in wildtype , CD1d KO , J a 18 KO and RAG2KO mice . Similar to TM40D , TM40D - MB tumors were highly metastatic in the RAG2 KO mice , demonstrating the importance of adaptive lymphocytes in regulating both TM40D and TM40D - MB tumors . As with other type II NKT dominant CD1d - deficient tumor models , TM40D - MB tumors did not grow at all in CD1d KO mice , yet were able to grow and metastasize in type I NKT - deficient J a 18 KO mice . These findings further demonstrate the importance of suppressive type II NKT cells in promoting tumor progression of tumors with downregulated CD1d . Preliminary experiments in our lab with J a 18 KO mice implanted with TM40D - MB tumors demonstrated a significant increase in splenic CD49b + CD4 + TCR b + cells , believed to be type II NKT cells ( unpublished results ) . This suggests that while CD1d expression in these tumor cells is downregulated , they may still be capable of being recognized by type II NKT cells . One possible explanation for the discrepancy in recognition of TM40D and TM40D - MB tumors by type II NKT cells is that it may not depend solely on the expression level of CD1d . Rather , the ability of CD1d - expressing tumor cells to promote type I over type II NKT immune responses may depend more on the type of tumor antigen presented by CD1d molecules . In support of this theory , a recent study demonstrated that inflammation - associated lipids presented by APCs in the tumor microenvironment preferentially recruit suppressive type II NKT cells [ 62 ] . In addition , glycolipid antigens recognized by type II NKT cells may differ from type I NKT cells , in that type II NKT activation does not require CD1d trafficking through endosomes [ 63 , 64 ] . As a tumor progresses , the tumor microenvironment is well known to induce inflammation , which facilitates tumor growth and eventually fosters the recruitment of suppressive immune cells that further promote metastatic tumor progression [ 65 ] . It may be that downregulation of CD1d by the tumor is a fairly early event in tumor progression , and thus not associated with the late - stage inflammatory tumor NKT - Mediated Antitumor Immunity in Breast Cancer PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 11 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20702 microenvironment that preferentially recruits type II NKT cells . Thus , tumor downregulation of CD1d may be advantageous for evasion of iNKT - mediated immune surveillance in the early stages of tumor progression , when antigens presented by tumor cells such as TM40D may preferentially elicit type I over type II NKT antitumor immune responses . In late - stage metastatic breast cancer , such as in TM40D - MB , presentation of inflammatory tumor antigens by even a low level of CD1d may be sufficient to drive type II NKT - mediated immune suppression . In our tumor model , TM40D - MB tumors have been shown to be more metastatic to lung and significantly more metastatic to bone than TM40D tumors [ 8 ] . While the focus of this study was on early spontaneous metastasis to lung , future studies characterizing the ability of TM40D - MB cells in bone to preferentially recruit type II NKT cells may shed light on mechanisms that increase their bone metastatic potential . In summary , the eradication of breast cancer through bolstering iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity remains a promising thera - peutic direction . The results of this study further support the development of immunotherapeutics that increase the activation and function of type I iNKT cells , while inhibiting the suppressive effects of type II NKT cells . Based on our findings of the tumor - promoting effects of anti - CD1d monoclonal antibody treatment of CD1d - expressing tumor cells , current therapeutic strategies based on globally inhibiting CD1d by antibody blockade are not recommended . Rather , the CD1d expression status of the tumor and the stage of disease progression may be important consider - ations in tailoring future breast cancer immunotherapies that effectively promote iNKT - mediated antitumor immunity .
