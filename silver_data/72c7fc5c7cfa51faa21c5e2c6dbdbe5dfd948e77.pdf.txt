Sturgis 2 and Simon Scheuring 1 * For cells to function properly 1 , membrane proteins must be able to diffuse within biological membranes . The functions of these membrane proteins depend on their position and also on protein – protein and protein – lipid interactions 2 . However , so far , it has not been possible to study simultaneously the struc - ture and dynamics of biological membranes . Here , we show that the motion of unlabelled membrane proteins can be character - ized using high - speed atomic force microscopy 3 . We ﬁnd that the molecules of outer membrane protein F ( OmpF ) are widely distributed in the membrane as a result of diffusion - limited aggregation , and while the overall protein motion scales roughly with the local density of proteins in the mem - brane , individual protein molecules can also diffuse freely or become trapped by protein – protein interactions . Using these measurements , and the results of molecular dynamics simu - lations , we determine an interaction potential map and an inter - action pathway for a membrane protein , which should provide new insights into the connection between the structures of indi - vidual proteins and the structures and dynamics of supramole - cular membranes . Membrane protein diffusion plays an important role in cellular processes , ensuring the proper distribution of molecules as well as bringing them into transient contact with functional partners 4 . Outer membrane protein F ( OmpF ) is the major porin in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli , where it forms trimeric channels for the passage of water , ions , sugars , polar nutrients and waste up to 700 Da in weight 5 , 6 . Diffusion in the membrane is an important factor in the function of OmpF as it has to be widely distributed on the cell surface for phage recognition 7 to occur , and also has to form a transient translocon with vitamin B 12 receptor BtuB for colicin import 8 , 9 . Here , we use high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) to study the diffusion , dynamics and organization of unlabelled OmpF in near - native conditions . OmpF co - puriﬁed with the natural outer membrane component lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) was reconstituted into E . coli lipids at a realistic surface density of (cid:2) 50 % ( 1 × 10 5 molecules per cell with a surface area 5 of (cid:2) 10 m m 2 ) and imaged in physiological buffer at ambient temp - erature and pressure . Under these experimental conditions we were able to acquire movies that show with unprecedented resol - ution the translational and rotational dynamics of these unlabelled membrane proteins in a membrane environment ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Movie S1 ) . Detailed analysis allowed us to gain novel insights into the factors governing protein organization and dynamics , in particular the conformations , energetics and pathways of membrane mediated interaction between membrane proteins . We used cross - correlation - based algorithms 10 to analyse membrane organization and the motion of individual molecules in each frame ( 750 Å ) 2 . The particle location and orientation were deﬁned with Ångstro¨m precision and with a time resolution of 477 ms over a period of minutes ( Fig . 1b , c ; technical details can be found in the Materials and Methods section in the Supplementary Information ) . We ﬁrst used fractal analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the complexity and order in the two - dimensional arrangement of OmpF molecules in the membrane 11 . The overall molecular distri - bution of the OmpF in the membrane showed a highly intricate geo - metry with high fractal dimension D ≈ 1 . 73 + 0 . 01 ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) , which is characteristic of diffusion - limited aggregation 12 . Such a fractality optimizes the membrane distribution of OmpF to provide a wide variety of local environments and interaction possi - bilities for individual molecules , which is probably important for the dynamic formation of translocon complexes 13 . For comparison , a simulation of OmpF arranged in a two - dimensional array had a fractal dimension of D ≈ 1 . 05 + 0 . 02 , so the OmpF in our experi - ments expose about twice as much molecular surface as molecules in a regular array ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Different local environments strongly affect the dynamics of individual membrane proteins . For example , crowding has pre - viously been identiﬁed as a possible source of limited diffusion 14 but was exclusively examined with modelling 15 . With HS - AFM , a technique that allows for the explicit observation of the environ - ment of a moving protein , we can now experimentally assess the effect of crowding for the ﬁrst time . To analyse this crowding effect we traced the molecular move - ments and measured the available area for each molecule using Voronoi tessellation 16 of the surface ( Fig . 1d ) . The borders between Voronoi cells are equidistant from the two closest mole - cules . A clear trend correlating increased molecular motion with increased available membrane area can be established . Voronoi cell areas show a distribution ranging from (cid:2) 7 , 000 Å 2 to (cid:2) 20 , 000 Å 2 , peaking at (cid:2) 12 , 000 Å 2 ( for comparison the membrane area occupied by a projected X - ray structure trimer 17 is (cid:2) 4 , 700 Å 2 , and trimers in two - dimensional crystals 18 occupy (cid:2) 5 , 700 Å 2 ) ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . The histogram of the areas of the Voronoi cells shows that the majority of molecules are conﬁned into a small membrane space , with a few molecules disposed in a free membrane area much larger than the average area , these being the molecules that actually diffuse . Interestingly , some molecules that are located in large Voronoi cells do not display motion ( Fig . 1d , red star ) . These molecules appear to participate in characteristic assemblies that are stable over time .

They appear to assemble most frequently by intercalating their subunit grooves or by interacting with their subunit apex ( Supplementary Fig . S4 , Supplementary Movies S2 and S3 ) . These associations are discussed in detail in the following . We also report the diversity of molecular motion within the membrane by calculating a membrane heat - map 19 , which displays the average velocity of OmpF motion at each location over time ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . The heat - map shows areas of high velocity and areas where molecules are essentially immobile throughout the movie acquisition as a result of local and neighbourhood - dependent molecular motion ( Supplementary Movie S4 ) . In conclusion , the dynamics of the molecules seem to be dominated by crowding and speciﬁc interactions between neighbours . The variation in the molecular motion , with some molecules being essentially immobile and trapped but others diffusing temporally ( as can be seen in the HS - AFM movie ; Fig . 1 , Supplementary Movie S1 ) , precludes the calculation of an effective diffusion constant . An example of a track of an essentially immobile molecule reveals only minor displacements ( Fig . 2a , blue ) ; it rattles around a ﬁxed position ( Fig . 2b , blue ) , and the calculated mean square displacement ( MSD ) as a function of the lag time indicates corralled sub - diffusive behaviour 20 ( Fig . 2c , blue ) . In contrast , some molecules move more rapidly , with a maximum measured vel - ocity of (cid:2) 25 nm s 2 1 ( Fig . 2a , red ) within a Voronoi cell of area (cid:2) 20 , 000 Å 2 ( Fig . 2b , red ) . Such molecules diffuse freely over a long timescale , as shown by the slope of (cid:2) 1 . 1 in the log ( MSD ) versus log ( D t ) plot of Fig . 2c ( red ) . The dynamics of the molecules are not biased by the HS - AFM tip interaction , as no directional correlation with the fast scan axis is observed ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . Furthermore , under the imaging conditions used , we estimate the applied force to be too low to affect molecular movement ( (cid:2) 50 pN ; refs 21 , 22 ) , and the tip interacts with the sample only (cid:2) 1 . 6 times on each pixel over (cid:2) 160 ns . Additionally , we ruled out scan direction bias by increasing the HS - AFM imaging speed to 204 ms per frame , and found similar molecule dynamics ( Supplementary Fig . S6 and Movie S5 ) . Spector and colleagues 13 reported that ﬂuorophore - antibody - labelled OmpF in cells diffused much more quickly within an area with a diameter of 100 nm than reported here . These discrepancies can originate from variations in membrane crowding , different timescales ( , 250 ms ) , different experimental procedures and potential frictional coupling with the support through the thin lubrication layer . Early electron microscopy studies have indicated a high density of porin packing in the outer membrane , which is likely to result in signiﬁcantly restricted protein movement 5 , 23 . In the crowded membrane , HS - AFM provides evidence that the displacement of one molecule can induce a chain motion , allowing movement of another molecule ( Supplementary Fig . S7 and Movies S6 and S7 ) . As well as the analysis of the lateral motion of the OmpF , the sub - molecular resolution of our topographs allows the angular 10 nm t = 0 ms t = 1 , 908 ms t = 2 , 385 ms t = 2 , 862 ms t = 3 , 339 ms t = 3 , 816 ms 10 nm 10 nm 10 nm 10 nm 10 nm t = 5 , 724 ms 10 nm t = 9 , 540 ms 10 nm t = 10 , 017 ms 10 nm 10 nm 10 nm Δ t = 2 , 862 ms 10 nm Δ t = 477 ms 10 nm Δ t = 477 ms 10 nm Δ t = 954 ms 10 nm Δ t = 477 ms a b 10 nm Δ t = 477 ms 10 nm Δ t = 477 ms 10 nm Δ t = 477 ms 10 nm Δ t = 1 , 908 ms c 10 nm Δ t = 477 ms 10 nm Δ t = 1 , 908 ms 10 nm Δ t = 3 , 816 ms 10 nm Δ t = 477 ms a b c d t = 0 ms t = 1 , 908 ms t = 2 , 385 ms t = 2 , 862 ms t = 3 , 339 ms t = 3 , 816 ms t = 5 , 724 ms t = 9 , 540 ms t = 10 , 017 ms t = 10 , 494 ms t = 11 , 448 ms t = 11 , 925 ms t = 14 , 787 ms t = 15 , 264 ms t = 14 , 787 ms t = 15 , 264ms t = 10 , 494 ms t = 11 , 448 ms t = 11 , 925 ms 10 nm 10 nm 10 nm 10 nm 10 nm Figure 1 | HS - AFM movie frames showing the motion of OmpF trimers in the membrane .

About 80 % of the molecules are rela - tively stable and only rattle slightly about their preferred orientation , while the remaining (cid:2) 20 % of free molecules randomize their orientation between consecutive frames ( Supplementary Fig . S8A ) . Again , single molecules display different behaviours , depending on their molecular interactions ( Supplementary Fig . S8B and Movie S8 ) . As expected from the ensemble analysis , plotting rotation as a function of molecular displacement suggests only a weak tendency for scaled lateral and rotational movement ; molecules involved in short - distance protein – protein interactions barely rotate , in contrast to free molecules ( Supplementary Fig . S8C ) . Rotation and diffusion in a viscous bilayer have the same physical basis , so molecules that move 10 nm in 477 ms ( frame rate ) can rotate through more than 120 8 given that the dis - tance between subunits within a trimer is (cid:2) 3 nm . A much higher scan rate is therefore needed to assess rotational dynamics . To better understand our results and provide molecular insights about OmpF interactions , we performed molecular dynamics simu - lations ( MDS ) to examine the energetics and dynamics of OmpF trimers in a hydrated phospholipid bilayer . In these simulations we studied the dissociation of interacting proteins . The steered MDS suggests a speciﬁc reaction pathway for the association and dissociation of OmpF that involves coordinated separation and rotation as it passes through several conﬁgurations ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Movie S9 ) . The simulation suggests that this pathway is determined by solvation – desolvation by lipids of the membrane - embedded protein surfaces . At short centre - to - centre distances , protein – protein contacts are preserved to avoid the cre - ation of interstitial voids that would need to be ﬁlled with lipid molecules . In the simulation , as the separation distance increases , the two OmpF surfaces in ‘base - to - base’ contact ( Fig . 3a , label ‘a’ ) ﬁrst undergo a shear and rotation motion that gradually replaces protein – protein contacts with protein – lipid interactions . This motion results in a ‘base - to - tip’ assembly ( Fig . 3a , label ‘b’ ) . In a second step , a hinge motion takes place , leading to a ‘tip - to - tip’ con - ﬁguration ( Fig . 3a , label ‘c’ ) . In this arrangement the protein – protein contact is minimized and the energetic cost for separation is as low as possible . To estimate the energetics of the interaction between two OmpF trimers we used umbrella sampling to integrate the interaction potential along the dissociation pathway . In this potential energy map , ‘base - to - base’ and ‘tip - to - tip’ associations both correspond to stable conﬁgurations in potential wells ( Fig . 3a ) . Despite the constraining potential and the length of the simulation , some high - energy transition states might be poorly sampled in the inter - action energy proﬁle . These are conﬁgurations in which lipids between the two OmpF trimers are reorganized . Thus , although the examined dissociation pathway , the observed structures and the qualitative aspects of the energetic landscape are solid , the quan - titative aspects of the energy proﬁle should be interpreted with caution ( Fig . 3a ) . It is noteworthy that the shape of the energy land - scape calculated from the MDS is in agreement with that calculated from pair correlation function analysis of the molecular arrange - ments in the images , notably with a deep well corresponding to the ‘base - to - base’ arrangement at 7 nm ( data not shown ) . Despite the fact that the HS - AFM observations of reversible OmpF associations are very different in terms of timescale com - pared to MDS , the same conformations are found experimentally . Two OmpF trimers sample the same series of associations before dissociating from a ‘tip - to - tip’ arrangement and reorganizing with other partners ( Fig . 3b ) . The HS - AFM imaging depicts the detailed molecular position and rotation of (cid:2) 17 , 000 molecules ( (cid:2) 70 in each of the 239 frames ) , representing a large dataset of conformations to calculate the probability density map of molecu - lar arrangements ( Fig . 3c , Supplementary Movie S10 ) . This density map shows that the most frequent associations ( depicted by tri - angle - pair symbols in Fig . 3c ) are linked by high - density con - nections , suggesting that a low - energy pathway for structural interconversion exists , in agreement with the steered coarse - grained MDS ( Fig . 3a ) . In the experimental map ( Fig . 3c ) , the most occupied basins correspond to the ‘base - to - base’ , ‘base - to - tip’ and ‘tip - to - tip’ con - ﬁgurations , in agreement with those observed along the dissociation pathway ( Fig . 3b ) and in local minima of the computed free energy proﬁle ( Fig . 3a ) . The structural speciﬁcities of these conﬁgurations stem from the atomic properties of the OmpF surfaces that are reﬂected in the experimental data and retained in coarse - grained molecular models . It must be noted that the shortest - distance con - formation—‘base - to - base’—engages the largest possible interfaces between inter - subunit grooves of the molecules , and is thus particularly stable . Furthermore , the simulation predicts a repulsive regime at a centre - to - centre separation distance larger than 9 nm ( Fig . 3a , labels ‘d’ and ‘e’ ) , which is probably lipid - mediated due to protein membrane perturbation 24 . This repulsion may be reﬂected in the HS - AFM measurements by molecules undergoing chain - like movements between neighbours ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . It has been rationalized that membrane protein diffusion is inﬂuenced by crowding 25 , protein size 26 or by various more 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20 Position ( nm ) 0 25 0 25 Velocity ( nm s −1 ) C oun t , n P o s i t i on ( n m ) a b c 1 10 100 α Δ t 0 . 1 1 10 100 l o g M S D ( n m 2 ) log lag time Δ t ( s ) Figure 2 | Diffusion analysis of OmpF . a , Histogram of the displacement velocity of the molecules : blue , representative immobile molecule participating in a stable association ; red , representative diffusing molecule . b , c , Diffusion traces ( b ) and MSD as a function of lag time ( c ) of the two molecules .

Indeed speciﬁc protein – protein interactions play a crucial role . In the outer E . coli membrane , all membrane proteins experience on average the same crowding . Furthermore , the outer membrane porins OmpF 17 and trimeric maltoprotein LamB 28 are structurally very similar trimers . Previously , it has been reported that the diffusion properties of OmpF and LamB differ by up to two orders of magnitude 13 . This can be rationalized neither by the overall crowding nor by their size . Here , we show that individual molecules can show diffusive behaviour and engage in immobile stable assemblies with preferential protein – protein contacts . The formation of speciﬁc associations increases when a protein is abundant , as the probability of meeting in two dimensions scales with the number of molecules 29 . Hence , crowding is essential but must be considered for each protein species . Indeed OmpF is the most abundant outer membrane protein 5 and will therefore encounter most interaction partners . Consequently , due to speciﬁc interactions , proteins that form stable large ensembles with OmpF will feature slowed diffusion ( logarithmically 26 or proportionally 30 ) . Furthermore , such ensembles are more sensitive to being hindered in a crowded environment . Future experiments will address the interaction behaviour of less abun - dant protein species and the interaction between different types of outer membrane proteins . In summary , we have analysed the inﬂuence of membrane crowding on the motion of individual molecules within a membrane and have presented a ﬁrst interaction potential map and interaction pathway for a membrane protein . We have also discussed the par - ameters that can explain anomalous diffusion and have demon - strated the propensity of membrane proteins to participate in functional ensembles . It is clear that the membrane protein sequences have not only evolved at the ‘molecular core’ so as to perfect their biological function ( for example , transport ) , but have also evolved in terms of their membrane exposed surfaces to accomplish interaction . Methods The bacterial outer membrane protein OmpF associated with LPS was produced in E . coli and puriﬁed in 10 mg ml 2 1 of octyl - polyoxyethylene . The complexes were mixed with E . coli lipids at a lipid - to - protein ratio of 0 . 5 . Reconstitution occurred via detergent removal by using dialysis against 20 mM HEPES – NaOH ( pH 7 ) buffer supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl 2 . HS - AFM observations were performed in oscillating mode using optimized high - resolution imaging parameters . Short cantilevers designed for HS - AFM with a length of (cid:2) 6 m m , a spring constant of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 N m 2 1 , a resonance frequency of 600 kHz and a quality factor of (cid:2) 2 in solution were used , bearing an electron beam deposition tip at the end of the cantilever . The sensitivity of the AFM system to probe deﬂection was 0 . 1 V nm 2 1 . The free amplitude was (cid:2) 10 Å and the imaging amplitude setpoint was set to (cid:2) 90 % of the free amplitude . Under such conditions , the force applied by the HS - AFM tip on the sample was estimated to be , 100 pN . Received 3 April 2012 ; accepted 4 June 2012 ; published online 8 July 2012 References 1 .
