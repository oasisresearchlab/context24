COVID - 19 triggered oxidative stress , with hyperlipidemia correlated with susceptibility to severe COVID - 19 . Consequently , lipids peroxidation could be a likely candidate for disease progression and sequalae . Hence , this overview explored one of the commonly studied lipid peroxides , 4 - hydroxynonenal ( 4 - HNE ) , in terms of gamma - amino butyric acid ( GABA ) and glutamate . Higher glutamate and lower glutamine , a GABA substrate , triggered severe COVID - 19 . Increased glutamate and inflammatory cytokines induced GABA endocytosis , reducing the anti - inflammatory and antioxidant effects of GABA . Defective glutathione antioxidant was detected in Down syndrome , the latter was associated with severe COVID - 19 . Increased 4 - HNE , due to consumption of electronic devices and flavors containing 1 - bromopropane , was increased in inflammatory neurologic disorders . A higher hippocampal 4 - HNE triggered excitotoxicity and cognitive deficits . Hippocampal inflammation and loss were also evident in COVID - 19 . 4 - HNE might play role in disturbing sleep and cognition in children during COVID - 19 , a hypothesis that could be verified in future research by redeeming 4 - HNE in the sputum and urine of children . Currently , sup - plying children with optimum dietary antioxidants , while rationalizing the use of flavors is to be encouraged . Keywords : COVID - 19 , insomnia , 4 - Hydroxynonenal , cognition , GABA , lipid peroxidation 1 . Introduction Until early January 2023 , over 660 million cases were diagnosed with coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) , most cases residing in Europe with much less cases in Africa , and the United States being the most affected country [ 1 ] . When first recognized in late 2019 and early 2020 , COVID - 19 was thought of as an ‘adult and older’ disease , exempting the younger population . Later , this revelation was falsified by positive infected cases found among neonates and children . Despite lower death rates at COVID - 19 Epidemiology in Children 2 younger ages , COVID - 19 survivors are mainly those in the pediatric age group . The milder disease was related to lower immune responses in children [ 2 ] . Knowing that COVID - 19 has affected 6 . 3 % of children aged 5 – 14 years old from December 30 , 2019 till September 13 , 2022 [ 3 ] would give us clues about the magnitude of post - COVID in children , even if definite evidence is still missing [ 4 ] . Reports outlining the possibility of asymptomatic disease occurring in children [ 5 ] suggest that the global prevalence of COVID in children may be much higher than the registered cases . In contrast , other studies highlighted that children were especially afflicted by hyperinflammatory multisystem syndrome [ 6 – 8 ] . The issue arose when some studies detected that recurrent infection is likely to occur in school children , compared to pre - school age , and that some of the affected children tested negative for viral antigen and antibodies and they did not shed the virus [ 9 – 11 ] , which can lead us to infinite unexplored areas of research targeting whether the virus remains dormant or not , for how long and where , in the neurological system and / or elsewhere . Are there late - onset sequalae that could affect the future quality of life of young generations or even be transmitted to their offspring after decades ? The anonymous fate of viral infection in children who survived but did not shed the virus should draw the attention of investigators toward the outcomes of COVID - 19 on various aspects , including cognition as one crucial vector in childhood determining the ability to learn , develop new skills , and have a future fruitful life . During the post - COVID period , survivors suffered neuropsychiatric symptoms , including anxiety and mood disturbances [ 12 ] . Such neuropsychiatric sequalae were attributed to the viral invasion of the brain [ 13 ] and neural control over the immune system [ 14 ] . In their retrospective cohort study , Taquet , Geddes , et al . [ 15 ] noticed a higher liability for insomnia during 6 months post - COVID , one plausible explanation was the impact of inflammatory cytokines over neuroendocrine sleep mediators [ 16 ] . Although a direct link between insomnia and liability for a more severe COVID - 19 was not conclusive , yet inferences could be made based on previous studies show - ing that persons who had less than 7 hours of daily sleeping were three times more vulnerable to getting a flu attack [ 17 ] . An association between disturbed sleep or even prolonged sleep and a state of low - grade systemic inflammation was suggested [ 18 , 19 ] , the latter impaired the immune defenses against the respiratory pathogens [ 16 , 20 , 21 ] , added to a higher risk of developing pneumonia [ 22 ] . The deleterious effects of dis - turbed sleep over immunity were also emphasized in Module 2 of The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) [ 23 ] declaring more than 50 % decline in the production of antibodies following influenza vaccination in presence of sleep shift - ing , compared to regular sleep . As the susceptibility to COVID - 19 is higher with cardiovascular diseases , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , and obesity , and as dyslipidemia is common among these vulner - able groups [ 24 – 26 ] , a causal relationship might exist between lipid metabolism and COVID - 19 morbidity . Apart from the structural , non - structural , and accessory proteins identified for severe acute respiratory syndrome virus ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , lipid - based structures remain to be identified , especially when knowing their pivotal role in viral fusion , entry , and replication and that the host lipid profile is altered following COVID - 19 [ 27 , 28 ] . The involvement of lipids in promoting the creation of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) progeny is becoming increasingly an interesting entity that awaits further exploration . Interestingly , insomnia has been reported to alter lipid metabolism and trigger lipid peroxidation [ 29 ] . Both insomnia and lipid peroxidation were associated with cognitive decline [ 30 , 31 ] . In this con - text , this overview will focus on the relationship between COVID - 19 , insomnia , and 3 4 - Hydroxynonenal Is Linked to Sleep and Cognitive Disturbances in Children : Once upon the… DOI : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / intechopen . 110285 4 - hydroxynonenal ( 4 - HNE ) , as the most studied among lipid peroxides , on one side , and cognitive defects , on the other side . 2 . COVID - 19 in children : insomnia and cognitive defects The American Academy of Sleep Medicine [ 32 ] has quoted from the Centers of Disease Control ( CDC ) that sleep disturbances among middle - and high - school stu - dents were highly prevalent . This prevalence was also noticed in survivors of COVID - 19 who experienced long - term insomnia [ 33 ] with younger age being more vulnerable [ 34 ] . During COVID - 19 , higher liability to insomnia was also reported in students , compared to workers , and in undergraduates , compared to postgraduates [ 35 , 36 ] . Novel stressors were superimposed with the emergence of COVID - 19 , includ - ing locking down at home , studying in an isolated environment with no social interactions , lacking friends , missing both physical activities and teamwork - based learning , having one or more of beloved family members affected , added to dealing with stressed parents [ 37 ] . Learning at home has posed a greater stressful challenge to parents whose anxiety was transferred to their children [ 38 ] . All these stressors contributed to higher anxiety in children , and subsequent sleep issues [ 39 ] , includ - ing , inability to fall asleep , insufficient duration of sleep , excessive sleep duration , nightmares , and unstable sleep timings . In turn , disturbed sleep , by triggering mood swings , caused a further reduction in social interactions [ 40 ] , and impaired psycho - logical and physical well - being [ 41 ] . Interestingly , being home alone , using electronic devices during studying , playing , or chatting , were associated with poor sleep quality in children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) [ 42 ] . Attention , as one of the cognitive domains , tended to decline with insomnia . Focused attention , detected by responding to a specific stimulus while overlooking other stimuli , was reduced with insomnia [ 43 ] . Vigilance ( sustained attention ) or the ability to keep alertness over time [ 44 ] was negatively affected by insomnia with reduced accuracy and prolonged time needed to perform vigilance - related tasks [ 45 ] . Similarly , shifting attention or the ability to adapt and modify the focus of atten - tion , requiring a higher level of cognition [ 46 ] , was defective in cases with insomnia [ 47 ] . However , some other studies did not prove these correlations , especially for the simplest form of attention , focused attention [ 48 , 49 ] . Another cognitive domain , memory , was negatively impacted by insomnia [ 50 , 51 ] , whether working memory or that of the implicit ( procedural ) or explicit ( declarative ) categories . These three memory categories correspond to the inability of keeping information for a short period [ 46 ] , learning new skills , and recalling a new learned material after a delay , respectively [ 52 ] . In a meta - analysis , there was a mild correlation between insomnia and working memory , yet the authors declared that results could be biased by the heterogenicity between studied groups in different studies . Other studies denied such an insomnia - memory relationship [ 48 , 53 ] . Whatever is the magnitude of controversy regarding the correlation between insomnia and cognitive defects , most studies agreed about the correlation between stress and both cognition [ 54 , 55 ] and sleep , especially , at a young age [ 56 ] . What links cognition to sleep at the neuronal level ? In terms of memory , the role of glutamate , the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain , in the encoding and consolidation of memory through binding to its ionotropic receptors , N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) , and its metabotropic receptors ( mGLuRs ) , respectively , has been established [ 57 , 58 ] . Li et al . [ 59 ] in a meta - analysis of the African population COVID - 19 Epidemiology in Children 4 concluded that the higher glutamate , and the lower its byproduct , glutamine , the more severe would be COVID - 19 and related cognitive defects . In astrocytes , glutamate is converted by glutamine synthetase to glutamine , the substrate of both gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) and glutamate [ 60 ] . GABA , the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain , is also modulated , through NMDA activation when glutamate is released , then presynaptic auto - recep - tors GABA B stimulation , mediating GABA endocytosis [ 61 ] . In the brain , more than 50 % of synapses are GABAergic [ 62 ] , signifying the pleiotropic effects of GABA . 3 . Gamma - aminobutyric acid linking sleep and cognition GABA is an amino acid present in plants , bacteria , fungi , animals , and humans [ 63 – 65 ] . GABA in vertebrates is synthesized and metabolized ( as shown in Figure 1 ) [ 66 , 67 ] . GABA acts on two types of receptors , the fast ionotropic or ligand - gated ion channel , GABA A , and the slow metabotropic or G protein - coupled receptor , GABA B . The binding of GABA to GABA A results in chloride influx and a fast hyperpolariza - tion of postsynaptic neurons . While GABA B receptors are present in presynaptic and postsynaptic [ 68 ] . Postsynaptic GABA B stimulation produces a slow , but long - term hyperpolarization . Presynaptic GABA B activation reduces the release of many neurotransmitters , including GABA itself , yielding either an excitatory or inhibi - tory brain signaling , depending on whether the suppressed neurotransmitter was Figure 1 . GABA , glutamate , 4 - HNE in COVID - 19 - related insomnia and cognitive defects . GABA in vertebrates is derived from L - glutamic acid or its salts , glutamate , by a decarboxylation reaction , catalyzed by GAD , and using PLP as a cofactor . After its release , GABA is uptaken by GATs 1 , 2 , and 3 as well as BGT - 1 and metabolized by GABA - transaminases ( GABA - T ) . Upon glutamate release , it simulates NMDA , with subsequent presynaptic GABA B activation , mediating GABA endocytosis . Increased glutamate , along with reduced glutamine , aggravates COVID severity . GABA is secreted from B - lymphocytes to exert anti - inflammatory effects . GABA promotes antioxidants , reducing lipid peroxides , including 4 - HNE . COVID - 19 triggers inflammation and oxidative stress . Both COVID - 19 and increased hippocampal 4 - HNE cause inflammation and neurodegeneration , precipitating insomnia and cognitive decline , which could be antagonized by GABA anti - inflammatory and neurogenesis effects .

This means that if auto - receptors’ presynaptic GABA B is stimulated , GABA release is dampened leading to a depolarizing postsynaptic cur - rent , or disinhibition . If a heteroreceptor GABA B was activated , glutamate release could be suppressed , which would favor an inhibitory status [ 69 ] . From functional perspective , GABA is implicated in sleep regulation and memory enhancement [ 70 ] . GABA deficiency can lead to insomnia , anxiety , and impaired stress responses [ 71 – 73 ] . The established role of GABA in sleep and sedation led to the wide use of benzodiazepines ( BZs ) as hypnotics and anxiolytics , acting by enhanc - ing the binding of GABA to its receptors , GABA A [ 74 , 75 ] . Unfortunately , BZs are associated with a high risk of tolerance and dependence [ 76 ] which mitigated their long - term use . Despite the crucial role of GABA in the processes of sleep and cognition , it is not the only one , as inflammatory factors seem to contribute as well . In COVID - 19 , during the cytokine storm , excessive amounts of pro - inflammatory cytokines are produced , of which the tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - α ) induced the endocytosis of GABA A , possibly rationalizing the associated sleep disturbances . In the cognition domain , fast - spike GABAergic interneurons play a crucial role in the generation of electroencephalographic gamma rhythms [ 77 ] , as well as hip - pocampal theta rhythm , corresponding to exploratory behavior [ 78 ] . Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , generated by GABA , assist memory acquisition in rodents and humans [ 79 , 80 ] , and the progression to memory consolidation requires GABA B activation [ 81 ] . This GABA - cognitive function was experimentally verified when the passive avoidance learning of mice and rats was inhibited after the blockade of GABA B using baclofen [ 82 , 83 ] . Furthermore , by promoting neurogenesis , GABA enriches long - term memory and learning processing [ 84 ] . This was emphasized in stressful conditions when mice with depressive - like symptoms exhibited defective neurogenesis and reduced microglia [ 85 ] , along with reduced survival in neural stem progenitor cell culture [ 86 ] . In ASD , decreased glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) , GABA A , and GABA B were observed in postmortem specimens [ 87 ] , with GABA A reduction possibly underlying the co - existing delayed linguistic abilities [ 88 ] , along with behavioral deficits ; the latter being also demonstrated in transgenic animal models [ 89 ] . Although multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is mainly a disease of young adults , it is the most common neurologic disorder due to immunologic dysfunction in children and adolescents [ 90 ] . In MS , where 65 % of patients have disturbed memory and atten - tion , low plasma GABA was detected [ 91 ] . Recent reports revealed aggravated or de novo symptoms of MS associated with COVID - 19 [ 92 ] . Hence , GABA might be a likely candidate for COVID - related cognitive derangement . 4 . Inflammation , oxidative stress , and GABA : key targets in COVID A growing body of evidence supports the secretion of GABA and its precursors , glutamine , and glutamate , from murine and human B - lymphocytes , [ 93 ] . While GABA A reduces T - cell response to antigens [ 94 ] and dampens inflammation , it endorses regulatory T - cells [ 95 ] . In turn , T - cells enhance the expression of GABA receptor subunits [ 96 ] . Additionally , GABA transporter - 1 ( GAT - 1 ) , found only on antigen - primed T - cells , arrested the proliferation of CD4 + and CD8 + T - cells [ 97 ] . Such GABA immunomodulatory effect could prevent the tissue damage elicited by inflam - matory responses in cases of autoimmune diseases , as inferred from rodent models of COVID - 19 Epidemiology in Children 6 DM and MS [ 98 – 100 ] . In patients with DM , the secretion of TNF - α and interleukin ( IL ) - 6 ( IL - 6 ) from T - cells was successfully inhibited using GABA [ 101 , 102 ] . Such systemic anti - inflammatory potentiality of GABA was detected also in macro - phages and dendritic cells of rodents and humans , expressing the respective fast GABA A and slow GABA B receptors [ 103 ] . GATs dampen the functions and release of pro - inflammatory cytokines as demonstrated in a mouse model of autoimmune encephalo - myelitis ( EAE ) [ 97 ] . Thus , it was not surprising to find that the most common subtype of GABA A in the brain , ( α 1 β 2 γ 2 ) , was also expressed in immune cells [ 104 ] . Conversely , immuno - stimulation and cytokines release promoted the neuronal sequestration of extracellular GABA [ 67 ] . In the brain , neuroinflammation , vascular insufficiency , and the pro - inflammatory cytokines , such as TNF - α , interferon - gamma ( IFN - γ ) , IL - 6 and IL - 1 β enhanced GAT expression , favoring GABA degradation [ 105 – 108 ] . In the context of lung diseases , GABA , along with enhanced GABA A and GABA B activities could limit acute lung injury in rodent models and ameliorate clinical outcomes in humans on ventilation [ 109 , 110 ] . As an inhibitor of platelet aggregation , GABA , by inhibiting the formation of the thromboxane A2 [ 111 ] , might have an addi - tional clinical privilege in patients whose pulmonary thrombosis is attributed to the severe COVID - 19 [ 112 , 113 ] . These assumed benefits of early treatment with GABA in COVID - 19 were verified in mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus ( MHV - 1 ) [ 114 ] , another coronavirus whose symptoms mimic those of COVID - 19 [ 115 ] . The COVID - associated anxiety and stress could have resulted in lowered immu - nity [ 116 ] , which could be reversed using GABA as was emphasized in human volun - teers when oral GABA administration resulted in electroencephalographic evidence of relaxed alertness and anti - stress effects ( higher alpha - to - lower beta ) [ 117 ] , while increasing salivary IgA [ 118 ] , as a non - invasive index of enhanced upper respiratory immunity against bacteria and viruses [ 119 ] . Interestingly , extracellular glutamine , the GABA precursor , was implicated in viral replication of both DNA and RNA viruses to which SARS - CoV - 2 belongs , by incorporation into the Kreb’s cycle after conversion by glutaminase ( GLS ) to alpha - ketoglutarate ( α - KG ) , so that the lack of glutamine hampered rhinoviruses replication [ 120 ] . Presumably , if GABA synthesis is inhibited , glutamine would be redirected to promote viral replication and , in case of viral infection , defective GABA synthesis would be anticipated secondary to the incorporation of glutamine in the viral replica - tion cycle . Knowing that COVID - 19 can precipitate oxidative stress [ 121 , 122 ] while GABAergic neurons are especially susceptible to the neuro - damaging effects of the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , generated during oxidative stress [ 123 ] , makes both GABA and oxidative stress likely candidates for aggravating the sequalae of COVID - 19 . Hypercholesterolemia might perpetuate viral infections as was the case in mice infected with lymphocyte choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) [ 124 ] . Some viral infec - tions and related treatments can induce long - term changes in lipid metabolism as well . After 12 years of SARS - CoV , survivors had higher cell membrane phospholipids , namely , phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylinositol , attributed to cortico - steroid administration during the infection [ 125 ] . In the post - infection period of SARS - CoV , lysocardiolipin acetyltransferase ( LCLAT ) , phosphoinositide phosphatase ( PIP ) , and diacylglycerol ( DG ) kinase , enzymes involved in lipid metabolism , were upregulated [ 126 ] . Coronaviruses consume the intracellular membranes of host cells to build their own replication nests called “double - membrane vesicles ( DMVs ) , ” where it preserves 7 4 - Hydroxynonenal Is Linked to Sleep and Cognitive Disturbances in Children : Once upon the… DOI : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / intechopen . 110285 its own viral proteins and robbed host factors , to ensure a suitable lipid bedding for a successful viral replication [ 127 ] . Of interest to our discussion is the increased total cholesterol ( TC ) in patients with COVID - 19 , favoring viral invasion , with a positive correlation to the severity of symp - toms [ 93 ] . The lipid changes might be attributed to hypoxia and were also shared with patients having a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) [ 128 ] . On the other hand , normal lipid metabolism seems preemptive in the context of pulmonary and neuronal disorders as sphingolipids were implicated in protection from a lung injury , added to their anti - inflammatory , anti - coagulant , along with their neuroprotective effects [ 129 , 130 ] . Hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress during COVID make lipids peroxidation likely candidates for post - COVID syndrome . 5 . Lipid peroxidation Oxidative stress is conceived as an imbalance between oxidants and antioxi - dants , in favor of oxidation . In physiology , such oxidative stress is minimal and well - equilibrated in a process known as “the redox potential . ” It is noteworthy to mention that an imbalance in the antioxidant direction is deleterious and causes “reductive stress” [ 131 ] . Conversely , when the antioxidant mechanisms are overwhelmed , oxidative stress occurs . The consecutive reversible oxidative stress and irreversible oxidative damage are to be blamed for many pathologic conditions [ 132 , 133 ] . With defective antioxidant mechanisms such as in the case of vitamin E ( alpha - tocopherol ) or vitamin C deficiency , excess reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are produced . The issue is that a propagation chain reaction perpetuates lipid peroxidation [ 131 ] as shown in ( Figure 2 ) . The interrup - tion of chain reaction occurs when two free radicals are conjugated or when antioxidants break the chain . Lipid peroxidation was formerly known for oils and fats in our diet . It involves oxidative damage to cellular structures , including cell membranes in plants and animals , causing cellular death . This destructive process includes the generation of lipid radicals , the uptake of oxygen , the re - organization of double bonds in unsatu - rated lipids , and the production of breakdown products such as alcohols , ketones , alkanes , aldehydes , and ethers . Lipid peroxidation results in an easily breakable cell membrane with plenty of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) and transition metals . Lipid peroxidation reduces membrane fluidity and makes it more permissible and easily invaded . Apart from the loss of cell membrane integrity , protein synthesis is disrupted , as well as macrophage function , along with derangement of chemotactic signals and altered enzyme activity [ 134 ] . All membranes of cellular structures are damaged , including those of mitochondria , microsomes , peroxisomes , and cell mem - branes [ 135 ] . Lipid peroxidation toxicity affects the liver , kidneys , and to our interest , neurological structures , where it takes part in neurodegenerative , inflammatory , and infectious diseases [ 136 ] . Considering the brain as a susceptible organ to oxidative stress , the intracellular antioxidant , free glutathione ( GSH ) plays a crucial role by eliminating peroxides [ 137 ] in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase ( GSH - Px ) , oxidizing GSH to GSH disulfide ( GSSG ) [ 138 ] . Thus , the GSH / GSSG can be used as a determinant of the redox status of cells [ 139 ] . Defective GSH was previously correlated to Down syndrome in children [ 140 ] . Recently , Down syndrome was correlated to severe COVID - 19 [ 141 ] . COVID - 19 Epidemiology in Children 8 Most of brain GSH is derived from the reducing action of GSH reductase ( GR ) over GSSG to get back GSH . Another less amount of GSH can be synthesized de novo from glutamate , cysteine , and glycine [ 142 ] . In contrast to the antioxidant GSH , one of the lipid peroxides , 4 - hydroxynonenal ( 4 - HNE ) , an α , β - unsaturated aldehyde , is a potent neurotoxin , derived from the oxidation of ω - 6 PUFA of cell membranes [ 143 ] , such as arachidonic acid , linoleic and linolenic acid . 6 . 4 - Hydroxynonenal 4 - Hydroxynonenal ( 4 - HNE ) is described as a short - chain reactive carbonyl compound [ 144 ] , having amphiphilic properties yet with lipophilic tendency [ 143 ] . Its high electrophilicity makes it reactive to the amino acid residues , namely , cysteine ( Cys ) , histidine ( His ) , and lysine ( Lys ) , in a decrescendo order . 4 - HNE can adduct to the cysteine residue of the “flippase” enzyme ( amino phospholipid - translocase ) , an enzyme that maintains lipid bilayer asymmetry by an ATP - dependent process [ 145 ] . Forming Michael adducts with nucleophilic sites , 4 - HNE can interact with cellular DNA , lipids , and proteins [ 146 ] . The destiny of 4 - HNE protein adducts is either proteolysis or covalent cross - linking . Additionally , 4 - HNE can inactivate GR , reducing the antioxidant ability of GSH [ 147 ] . In turn , physiological concentrations of GSH can revert 4 - HNE protein adducts to their unadducted condition [ 148 ] . Figure 2 . Propagation reaction of lipid peroxidation . Lipid peroxidation is initiated with hydrogen subtraction and oxygen addition . Hydrogen subtraction is promoted in PUFAs by the presence of a double bond of the RH group , leaving the carbon with an unpaired electron . When combined with oxygen , ROO is produced , generating ROOH , capable of repeating the hydrogen subtraction from another PUFA , perpetuating the chain reaction . When lipid peroxides interact with Fe + 2 , RO radicals are produced , when the interaction involves Fe + 3 , ROO radicals are generated . These reactions will end up with cytotoxic aldehydes and hydrocarbon gases as ethane . The interruption of chain reaction occurs when two free radicals are conjugated or when antioxidants , such as GSH , break the chain .

Although all these detoxifying processes are present in the mitochondria [ 150 ] , yet it seems that the mitochondria play little role in 4 - HNE degradation in intact tissue . In the lungs , GST is more active than the liver , then comes the brain in the third place , however , the respiratory capacity to metabolize 4 - HNE is limited by slow oxidative - reductive pathways , unlike the liver [ 151 , 152 ] . 4 - HNE can be detected in human breath and sputum [ 153 ] and its metabolites can be recovered in urine [ 154 ] . A slow metabolism of 4 - HNE was previously reported when dealing with rat hearts and kidneys , along with other tissues [ 155 ] . To our knowledge , HNE concentration at or below 1 μ M might be physiological , with in vitro toxicity at 10 μ M – 1 mM [ 156 ] . The physiological roles of HNE include , but are not limited to [ see Table 1 ] [ 157 – 164 ] . Dianzani [ 156 ] mentioned that , in pathologic conditions , the high concentrations of 4 - HNE suppress mitochondrial oxidation , lysosomal enzyme activity , adenyl cyclase , sodium pump , protein synthe - sis , and cell proliferation . Also , while physiological 4 - HNE concentrations can affect proteins , favoring proteolysis of the deformed proteins [ 165 ] , only extra - physiologic concentrations of 4 - HNE can increase membrane fluidity [ 166 ] . In inflammatory disorders such as osteoarthritis , 20 μ M HNE suppressed the high nuclear factor - kappa beta ( NF - κ B ) induced by TNF - α overexpression in human Targets of HNE Role Neutrophils chemotactic factor [ 157 ] Increased inflammatory response to invading pathogens AC [ 158 ] Catalyze the breakdown of ATP to yield cAMP PLC [ 159 ] Hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids in cell membranes , yielding the intracellular second messengers : IP 3 and DAG Caspases [ 160 ] Protease enzymes that mediate programmed cell death , leading , for example , to tumor suppression and axonal degeneration Hsp 70 [ 161 ] Increased antigens delivery to APCs Suppression of inflammation Aldose reductase [ 162 ] Cytosolic NADPH - dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of monosaccharides , for example , the reduction of glucose to sorbitol , the first step in glucose metabolism Hem oxygenases [ 163 ] The degradation of heme to CO , biliverdin and heme iron , mediating anti - inflammatory , anti - apoptotic , and potential anti - viral functions γ - GCS [ 164 ] Catalyzes the production of γ - glutamylcysteine from both glutamate and cysteine , and other glutamylpeptides and can be used as predictor of defective GSH redox AC : Adenyl cyclase ; ATP : Adenosine triphosphate ; cAMP : Cyclic adenosine monophosphate ; PLC : Phospholipase C ; IP 3 : Inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ; DAG : diacyl glycerol ; Hsp 70 : Heat shock proteins 70 ; APCs : Antigen - presenting cells ; NADPH : Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen ; CO : Carbon monoxide ; γ - GCS : γ - glutamyl cys synthetase ; GSH : Glutathione . At physiologic concentration , HNE seems to exert immunostimulatory activity by enhancing neutrophils’ chemotactic factor , increasing the production of multiple intracellular second messengers , such as cAMP , IP 3 , DAG , mediate tumor suppression , and might promote axonal degeneration and aging , along with immune - stimulatory , anti - inflammatory , anti - apoptotic , and possibly anti - viral functions . HNE catalyzes glucose metabolism and interestingly , can increase antioxidant activity . Table 1 . Physiological targets stimulated by hydroxynonenal ( HNE ) . COVID - 19 Epidemiology in Children 10 osteoblasts [ 167 ] . While most studies focused on the link between 4 - HNE and hepatic insult , few of them found that 4 - HNE was also implicated in multiple respiratory and neurological disorders , such as bronchial asthma , COPD [ 168 ] , Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) , and Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) [ 169 ] . The ability of 4 - HNE to diffuse from one organ to another [ 170 ] might indicate the accumulation of HNE in the lungs , for instance , can affect the brain , and vice versa . Fortunately , GSH was able to suppress 4 - HNE protein adducts in the liver , lungs , and brain [ 152 ] . In COPD , HNE adducts were increased in bronchial , bronchiolar , alveolar , and endothelial cells as well as macrophages and neutrophils . In alveolar epithelium , HNE adducts were inversely correlated to forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and positively linked to the pro - fibrotic cytokine , transforming growth factor - beta ( TGF - β ) [ 171 ] . In rat alveolar epithelial cells , HNE induced glutamylcysteinyl glycine ( GCS ) , the rate - limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis [ 172 ] , and enhanced the expression of antioxi - dants by recruiting nuclear factor erythroid 2 - related factor - 2 ( Nrf2 ) [ 173 , 174 ] . In vitro exposure to mild stress assisted the accelerated GSH - mediated removal of HNE and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress [ 175 ] , which might not apply to chronic stress when antioxidants are consumed . Measuring HNE in umbilical cord plasma , it was increased in full - term newborns exposed to acidosis and in full—as well as pre - term neonates experiencing asphyxia when compared to healthy controls [ 176 ] . A suggested role in autoimmunity was reported in children with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) when plasma HNE was increased , especially during the active disease stage [ 177 ] . The brain is a vulnerable organ that can be affected by oxidative stress owing to its relatively lower antioxidant capacity against a higher oxygen consumption rate , added to the abundance of PUFAs in neuronal cell membranes [ 178 ] . Upon 12 - day exposure of rats to oral 1 - bromopropane ( 1 - BP ) , a cleaning agent for electronic and optical instruments and an intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and flavors , the animals demonstrated behavioral evidence of impaired cognition with underlying oxidative stress as shown by the reduced level of GSH versus increased GSSG , owing to the inhibitory effect of 1 - BP over GR , with subsequently increased 4 - hydroxynon - enal ( 4 - HNE ) and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) [ 179 ] . The increased 4 - HNE was also rep - licated in patients with AD showing mild cognitive dysfunction [ 180 ] . It is to be noted that while human exposure to 1 - BP is by inhalation , yet , in experimental animals , the inhalation route might not yield similar neurological effects as the oral route . 4 - HNE can form adducts with glutamate transporter , excitatory amino acid transporter 2 ( EAAT2 ) [ 181 ] , dopamine transporter , sodium pump [ 182 ] , dopamine 1 ( D1 ) - like transporter [ 183 ] , and immunoglobulins [ 184 ] . In cultured rat cerebro - cortical neurons , HNE uncoupled cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors from the GTP - binding proteins [ 185 ] . In patients with ischemia – reperfusion and stroke , plasma HNE was elevated [ 186 ] . Immunohistochemical assay of the brain lesions in patients with the progressive demyelinating disease , multiple sclerosis , and the dominant autosomal disorder , Huntington’s disease ( HD ) , detected increased HNE [ 187 , 188 ] , along with elevation of the inflammatory marker C - reactive protein in serum of patients with advanced HD . In rat hippocampal cell culture , 10 μ M HNE hampered sodium pump activity , resulting in increased intracellular free Ca 2 + and predisposition to excitotoxicity [ 189 ] . The hippocampus is well known for its relevance to both cognition [ 190 , 191 ] and insomnia - related cognitive issues at all ages , including children [ 192 , 193 ] , and inflammation and loss were recently reported in COVID - 19 [ 194 ] . 11 4 - Hydroxynonenal Is Linked to Sleep and Cognitive Disturbances in Children : Once upon the… DOI : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / intechopen . 110285 7 . Hydroxynonenal - and GABA - targeted therapies Based on the presumptive involvement of HNE in COVID - related insomnia and subsequent cognitive dysfunction , HNE - targeted therapy might offer an exit door - way that might rescue the young generation . For instance , carnosine , a dipeptide ( β - alanyl - L - histidine ) abundant in mammalian skeletal muscle , can inhibit the cross - linking of HNE protein adducts [ 195 ] , and its analogs showed a similar neuroprotec - tive effect as emphasized in rats [ 196 ] . Nutritional support seems crucial to sustaining the growth and development of childhood processes , including those related to their emotional , cognitive , and behav - ioral aspects . Above all , supplying dietary antioxidants , including vitamin E , vitamin C , and glutathione , could be helpful . The consumption of wheat germ oil , sunflower oil and seeds , hazelnuts , and peanut butter , as sources of vitamin E , and red and green pepper , orange , kiwi , and broccoli , providing vitamin C , with recommended daily dietary allowances at 4 – 13 years old of 7 – 11 and 25 – 45 mg , respectively [ 197 ] . Despite the controversies regarding the extent of systemic GABA to cross the BBB [ 198 – 200 ] as quoted by Tian et al . [ 114 ] , supplying dietary GABA could add some benefit as an adjuvant to COVID treatment , especially since GABA has antioxidant properties [ 201 , 202 ] , GABA can be obtained from tomatoes , rice , soybean , and fermented food [ 70 ] . It is worthwhile that this policy can be adopted in the context of cognitive affection in children whose anxiety and insomnia could be the major contributing factors to the post - COVID syndrome . 8 . Conclusion Lipid peroxidation , along with inflammatory crisis , plays a crucial role , not only in the prognosis of COVID - 19 but also in neurological sequalae , namely , sleep and cognitive issues , by affecting both GABA and glutamate neurotransmission . 4 - HNE might have some role in both COVID - 19 and its neurological sequalae , triggering hippocampal inflammation and neurodegeneration , by disturbing gluta - mate / GABA neurotransmission . Perhaps a nutritional supply of antioxidants and abstaining from the consumption of flavors could support our children to maintain optimal sleep and develop cognitive skills . The rationale use of electronic devices is also recommended . A more vigorous investigation is still needed to verify the hypothesis of 4 - HNE involvement and to explore the feasibility of GABA—and HNE - targeted therapy in children who survived COVID - 19 with residual issues regarding sleep and cognition .
