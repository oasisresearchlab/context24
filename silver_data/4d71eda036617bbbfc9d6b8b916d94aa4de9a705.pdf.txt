J Wu Keywords : COVID - 19 epidemic in Wuhan SIR and SEIR models Bayesian inference Model selection Nonidenti ﬁ ability Quarantine Peak time of epidemic a b s t r a c t Since the COVID - 19 outbreak in Wuhan City in December of 2019 , numerous model pre - dictions on the COVID - 19 epidemics in Wuhan and other parts of China have been re - ported . These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations . In our study , we demonstrate that nonidenti ﬁ ability in model calibrations using the con ﬁ rmed - case data is the main reason for such wide variations . Using the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) for model selection , we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the con ﬁ rmed - case data . This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model . We present our model predictions for the COVID - 19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23 , 2020 . We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic , and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return - to - work in the city . © 2020 The Authors .

Introduction In early December 2019 , a novel coronavirus , later labelled as COVID - 19 , caused an outbreak in the city of Wuhan , Hubei Province , China , and it has further spread to other parts of China and many other countries in the world . By January 31 , the global con ﬁ rmed cases have reached 9 , 776 with a death toll of 213 , and the WHO declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern ( WHO , 2020 ) . By February 9 , the global death toll has climbed to 811 , surpassing the total death toll of the 2003 SARS epidemic , and the con ﬁ rmed cases continued to climb globally . As governments and public agencies in China and other impacted countries respond to the outbreaks , it is crucial for modelers to estimate the severity of the epidemic in terms of the total number of infected , total number of con ﬁ rmed cases , total deaths , and the basic repro - duction number , and to predict the time course of the epidemic , the arrival of its peak time , and total duration . Such in - formation can help the public health agencies make informed decisions . * Corresponding author . E - mail addresses : wroda @ ualberta . ca ( W . C .

Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 Since the start of the outbreak in Wuhan , several modeling groups around the world have reported estimations and predictions for the COVID - 19 ( formerly called 2019 - nCov ) epidemic in journal publications or on websites , for an incomplete list see ( Bai et al . , 2020 ; Imai , Dorigatti , Cori , Riley , & Ferguson , 2020 ; Read , Bridgen , Cummings , Ho , & Jewell , 2020 ; Shen , Peng , Xiao , & Zhang , 2020 ; Tang et al . , 2020b , a ; Wu , Leung , & Leung , 2020 ; You et al . , 2020 ; Yu , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020 ) . The modeling results have shown a wide range of variations ( Cyranoski , 2020 ) : estimated basic reproduction number varies from 2 to 6 , peak time estimated from mid - February to late March , and the total number of infected people ranges from 50 , 000 to millions . Why is there such a wide variation in model predictions , even among predictions made using transmission models based on either the SIR or SEIR framework ? We attempt to address this variability issue in our study . A simple answer for the wide range of model predictions might be that there was too little information at the beginning of the outbreak , especially before January 23 when Wuhan was quarantined and locked down , and that there was a lack of reliable data , except for the con ﬁ rmed case data that could be used for model calibration . Rigorous model calibration methods , including maximum likelihood methods and the Bayesian inference based MCMC methods , already take into consideration uncertainties in data by allowing the data at each time point to follow a probability distribution with the mean given by the assumed model and the variance t given by the assumed probability distribution , where the variance may depend on the mean . The lack of data , as we will demonstrate , is a more serious concern for modellers . A key issue that can explain the variability in model predictions is understanding how the available data ( con ﬁ rmed cases ) compares with model predictions . Con ﬁ rmed cases are people with symptoms who made contact with a hospital , got tested , and whose infection of COVID - 19 was con ﬁ rmed by DNA or imaging tests . The infected compartment in by transmission models represents all people who are infected . These include people who may or may not have symptoms and contacts with a hospital , as well as people with con ﬁ rmed laboratory tests and those who are misdiagnosed . In this sense , con ﬁ rmed cases ( data ) are only a fraction of the total infected population ( model predictions ) . A metaphor of an iceberg best represents the difference between data and model predictions . The entire iceberg represents the total infected population , and the tip of the iceberg above the sea surface represents the case data . The part of the iceberg hidden under the water represents the infected people that are unknown to public health surveillance and testing ; often called the hidden epidemic . The difference between cases and infections can be measured by the case - infection ratio r , between the newly con ﬁ rmed cases and the number of infected people , or as a surrogate , the ratio between the cumulative con ﬁ rm cases and the cumulative number of infected people . The case - infection ratio r can vary widely for different viral infections that spread through air droplets and close contacts . For the SARS epidemic , the ratio r was in the range of 1 = 5 (cid:1) 1 = 2 ( Chowell et al . , 2004 ; Gumel et al . , 2004 ; Lipsitch et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , for seasonal in ﬂ uenza in 2019 e 2020 , the ratio r can be as small as 1 = 100 , based on estimates from the US CDC ( US CDC , 2020 ) . Why should this be a problem for the modellers ? In model calibration , in order to estimate key model parameters such as the transmission rate b , by ﬁ tting the model output to the con ﬁ rmed cases data , it is necessary to discount the total number of infectious people , I ð t Þ , from the model prediction , by the case - infection ratio r to appro - priately predict con ﬁ rmed case data . For each value of the ratio r , a corresponding value for the transmission rate b can then be estimated by ﬁ tting the model to data , which in turn determines the basic reproduction number R 0 , the scale of the epidemic , as well as the peak time . Given the potential wide range for the case - infection ratio r of the COVID - 19 , the esti - mated transmission rate b has a wide range , and hence the wide range of reported model predictions . In modeling terms , given the con ﬁ rmed - case data , there is a linkage between the model parameter r and the transmission rate b , and potentially also with other model parameters . While many different combinations of r and b can show good ﬁ t to the data , they can produce very different model predictions of the epidemic . This is known as nonidenti ﬁ ability in the modeling literature , see e . g . ( Lintusaari , Gutmann , Kaski , & Corander , 2016 ; Raue et al . , 2009 ; van der Vaart , 1998 ) . It means that a group of model parameters can not be uniquely determined from the given data during model calibration . Different choices of parameter values with the same good ﬁ t to the data can lead to very different model predictions . The ways inwhich nonidenti ﬁ ability is addressed in the model calibration process greatly in ﬂ uences the reliability of model predictions . The standard nonlinear least squares method is known to be ill suited to detect or address the nonidenti ﬁ ability issue , since it relies on a rudimentary optimization algorithm . These rudimentary optimization algorithms attempt to ﬁ nd a global minimum of the given objective function , but there are in ﬁ nitely many global minima given nonidenti ﬁ ability . Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) procedures based on Bayesian inference often fail to converge to the target posterior distribution in the presence of nonidenti ﬁ ability , and can produce best - ﬁ t parameter values with unreliable credible intervals , since these often relies on elementary MCMC algorithms . Elementary MCMC algorithms converge very slowly given a very skewed posterior distribution . In our study , we used an improved model calibration method using Bayesian inference and af ﬁ ne invariant ensemble MCMC algorithm that can ensure fast convergence to the target posterior distribution when facing nonidenti ﬁ ability , and provide more reliable credible intervals and model predictions . Another important factor that can signi ﬁ cantly in ﬂ uence model predictions is the choice of a suitable model to describe the epidemic under study : a more complex or simpler model . A complex model incorporates more biological and epide - miological information about the epidemic and is more biologically realistic . A drawback of a complex model is that it requires more model parameters to be estimated compared to a simpler model . Given the dataset , such as the con ﬁ rmed case data of COVID - 19 , increased number of parameters in a complex model that are unknown and need to be estimated by model ﬁ tting can lead to a greater degree of uncertainty in model predictions . In choosing an appropriate model , it is important to draw a balance between biological realism and reducing uncertainty in model predictions , and this choice can signi ﬁ cantly in ﬂ uence the reliability of model predictions . The modeling procedure to determine the right balance is model selection using various information criteria , for instance the Akaike Information Criteria ( AIC ) for nested models ( Akaike , 1973 ; Sugiura , 1978 ) . W . C . Roda et al . / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 272 In our study , we considered both SEIR and SIR models for model predictions and applied model - selection analysis . For the given dataset of con ﬁ rmed cases , we determined that the SIR model is a better choice than the SEIR model , and more likely than models that are more complex than an SEIR model ( Section 3 ) . Our study focused on the development of the outbreak in Wuhan city after the quarantine and lockdown ( January 23 , 2020 ) , given the reliability of con ﬁ rmed case data and de ﬁ nition during this period and the simplicity in our predictions and analysis . We brie ﬂ y outline in Section 2 the methodology for model calibration using an improved procedure based on Bayesian inference and model selection method using Akaike In - formation Criteria . In Section 4 , using the SIR model , we illustrate the linkage between the transmission rate and case - infection ratio , and the presence of nonidenti ﬁ ability when only the con ﬁ rmed - case data is used for model calibration . In Section 5 , we present detailed results of the SIR model calibration and our model predictions , including the distribution of peak time , prediction interval of future con ﬁ rmed cases , as well as the total number of infected people . In Section 6 , we estimate the impact of further control measures recommended in Wuhan after February 7 and predicted the changes in peak time under different assumptions on the reduction of transmission achieved by these measures . In Section 7 , we estimated the impact of timing the return to work on the course of the epidemic , in terms of peak time , peak values , and the duration of the epidemics . Our results are summarized in Section 8 . 2 . Model calibration and model selection In this section , we give a brief description of a model calibration method based on Bayesian inference and the method of model selection using Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) . For more details the reader is referred to ( Portet , 2020 ; Roda , 2020 ) . Other model calibration procedures using nonlinear squares or more general maximum likelihood methods are not described here , and we refer the reader to ( Rossi , 2018 ) . Model selection methods using other information criteria can also be used , see e . g . ( Burnham & Anderson , 2002 ) . 2 . 1 . Af ﬁ ne invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for model calibration Mathematical Model . Consider a mathematical model given by a system of differential equations : x ’ ¼ f ð x Þ ; ( 1 ) where x ¼ ð x 1 ; / ; x k Þ denotes the vector of state variables , f ð x Þ ¼ ð f 1 ð x Þ ; / f k ð x ÞÞ the vector ﬁ eld . We let u 2 R n 1 be the vector of all model parameters , which often include initial conditions x 0 ¼ ð x 01 ; / ; x 0 k Þ . We assume that there exists a unique so - lution x ¼ x ð u ; t Þ for each given u . Data . Data is often given on the observable quantities , such as newly con ﬁ rmed cases , which are linear or nonlinear combinations of the solutions x ð u ; t Þ in the form : y ¼ y ð w ; t Þ¼ y ð x ð u ; t Þ ; v Þ ; where v 2 R n 2 are parameters in the observables y and w ¼ ð u ; v Þ 2 R n , n ¼ n 1 þ n 2 , is the vector of all model parameters to be estimated . Furthermore , the dataset is collected at N time points t 1 ; t 2 ; / ; t N . We will ﬁ t the model outputs y i ¼ y ð w ; t i Þ¼ y ð x ð u ; t i Þ ; v Þ ; i ¼ 1 ; 2 ; / ; N ; to the time series dataset D ¼f D 1 ; D 2 ; / ; D N g : Likelihood functions . In order to account for noise in the data , we let the probability of observing D i at time t i be given by f i ð D i Þ , with mean y i and variance q i ¼ s 2 i ¼ 1 = t i , i ¼ 1 ; 2 ; / ; N . Common probability distributions used for this purpose include the normal distribution , Poisson distribution , and negative binomial distribution . In our Bayesian inference , the variance q i ¼ 1 = t i in the noise distribution is also estimated from the data , giving us an accurate posterior distribution and accurate credible intervals for the estimated parameters . The entire set of parameters to be estimated includes model parameters u , parameters v in the observable function y , and the variances q ¼ ð 1 = t 1 ; 1 = t 2 ; / ; 1 = t N Þ , and is denoted by q ¼ð u ; v ; q Þ : We consider the likelihood function L ð q Þ¼ CP ð D j q Þ¼ C f 1 ð D 1 Þ f 2 ð D 2 Þ / f N ð D N Þ ; where C is a constant independent of q used to simplify the likelihood function ( Kalb ﬂ eisch , 1979 ) . Bayesian framework . The Bayesian framework assumes that a probability model for the observed data D given unknown parameters q is P ð D j q Þ , and that q is randomly distributed from the prior distribution P ð q Þ . Statistical inference for q is based on the posterior distribution P ð q j D Þ . Using Bayes Theorem we obtain W . C . Roda et al . / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 273 P ð q j D Þ ¼ P ð D j q Þ P ð q Þ P ð D Þ ¼ P ð D j q Þ P ð q Þ Z U P ð D j q Þ P ð q Þ d q f L ð q Þ P ð q Þ ¼ p ð q j D Þ ; where U is the parameter space of q and L ð q Þ is the likelihood function . Constant P ð D Þ ¼ R U P ð D j q Þ P ð q Þ d q is used to normalize the posterior distribution P ð q j D Þ ( Chen , Shao , & Ibrahim , 2000 ) . The unnormalized posterior distribution is given by p ð q j D Þ ¼ L ð q Þ P ð q Þ : The Bayesian framework is very useful for statistical inference that occurs in mathematical modeling since it allows utilization of the prior information about the unknown parameters in the literature . Epidemiological information about the infectious disease can often inform a general range for the parameters to be estimated , and the uniform distribution is typically chosen as the prior distribution in such a case . Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms . Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithms are used to approximate a posterior distribution of parameters by randomly sampling the parameter space ( Lynch , 2007 ) . In MCMC algorithms , a new vector of parameter values q ð t Þ is sampled iteratively from the posterior distribution , based on the previous vector q ð t (cid:1) 1 Þ , until a sample path ( also called a chain or walker ) has arrived at a stationary process and produces the target unnormalized posterior distribution . Commonly used MCMC algorithms include the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm and Random - Walk Metropolis - Hastings algorithms ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) . In our study , we used an improved MCMC algorithm , the af ﬁ ne invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm , which has been shown to perform better than Metropolis - Hastings and other MCMC algorithms , especially in the presence of nonidenti ﬁ ability . The algorithm uses a number of walkers and the positions of the walkers are updated based on the present positions of all walkers . For details on this algorithm , we refer the reader to ( Goodman & Weare , 2010 ; May , 2015 ) and recent lecture notes on this topic ( Roda , 2020 ) . 2 . 2 . Method of model selection using Akaike information criterion When using mathematical models to explain data that has been formed by an underlying disease process , the principle of parsimony should be used to select a suitable model . A parsimonious model is the simplest model with the least assumptions and variables but with the greatest explanatory power for the disease process represented by the data ( Johnson & Omland , 2015 ) . This principle is also re ﬂ ected in awell known quotation : “ Models should be as simple as possible but not simpler . ” This quotation is often ascribed to A . Einstein . The model selection method using Akaike Information Criterion takes into account both how well the model ﬁ ts the data and the principle of parsimony . Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) . Let L ð b q MLE Þ be the maximum likelihood value achieved at a best - ﬁ t parameter value b q MLE . Let K be the number of parameters to be estimated in a model , and N be the number of time points where data are observed . The Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) is de ﬁ ned as ( Akaike , 1973 ) : AIC ¼ (cid:1) 2ln ð L ð b q MLE ÞÞ þ 2 K : This de ﬁ nition should be used when K < N = 40 , namely when the number of time points N is large in comparison to the number of parameters . When K > N = 40 ; namely when the number of parameters is large in comparison to the number of time points , the following corrected AIC should be used ( Sugiura , 1978 ) : AIC c ¼ AIC þ 2 K ð K þ 1 Þ N (cid:1) K (cid:1) 1 : We note that in the Bayesian inference based calibration , the unnormalized posterior distribution p ð q j D Þ is equal to the product of the likelihood function L ð q Þ and the prior distribution P ð q Þ . The Akaike information criterion can be applied if uniform prior distributions are used for each parameter , since p ð b q MLE Þ ¼ g L ð b q MLE Þ , where g is a constant . Model selection using AIC . When several nested models , each having a different level of complexity , are considered as candidates for the most suitable model , AIC values can be computed for each model , and the model associated with the smallest AIC value is considered the best model . The difference of AIC i value of model i with the minimum min i AIC i : D i ¼ AIC i (cid:1) min i AIC i : This measures the information lost when using model i instead of a model with the smallest AIC value . When D i is larger , model i is less plausible . Useful guidelines for interpreting D i for nested models are as follows ( Burnham & Anderson , 2002 ) : (cid:3) If 1 (cid:4) D i (cid:4) 2 , model i has substantial support and should be considered . W . C . Roda et al . / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 274 (cid:3) If 4 (cid:4) D i (cid:4) 7 , model i has less support . (cid:3) If D i > 10 , model i has no support and can be omitted . When a large number of models are under consideration or the models are not nested , the model selection rules are different . We refer the reader to recent lecture notes ( Portet , 2020 ) for an introduction to model selection . 3 . Model selection analysis for an SEIR and an SIR model We used both SEIR and SIR frameworks to model the COVID - 19 epidemic in Wuhan , and we applied model selection analysis to decide which framework is more parsimonious . 3 . 1 . The models In our SIR and SEIR models , the compartment S denotes the susceptible population in Wuhan , compartment I denotes the infectious population , and R denotes the con ﬁ rmed cases . In the SEIR model , a latent compartment E is added to denote the individuals who are infected but not infectious . The latency of COVID - 19 infection is biologically realistic due to an incubation period as long as 14 days ; newly infected individuals may not be infectious while the virus is incubating in the body . Here we note the difference between the latent period , which is the period from the time an individual is infected to the time the individual is infectious , and the incubation period , which is the period between the time an individual is infected to the time clinical symptoms appear , which include fever and coughing for COVID - 19 . For SARS , infected individuals become infectious on average two days after the onset of symptoms WHO ( 2003 ) ; so , the SARS latent period is on average longer than the incubation period . For COVID - 19 , evidence has shown that infected individuals can be infectious before the onset of symp - toms ( Bai et al . , 2020 ) , but the length of the latent period is largely unknown . In comparison to the SIR model , the SEIR model has the strength of being more biologically realistic , but the SEIR model has the drawback of having two additional unknown parameters : the latent period and the initial latent population . The transfer diagrams for both models are shown in Fig . 1 . The biological meaning of all model parameters are given in Table 1 and Table 2 . A key assumption in both models is that deaths occurring in the S , E , and I compartments are negligible during the period of model predictions . ( 4 months ) . Since we use the newly con ﬁ rmed case data for model calibration , which is matched to the r I term in both models , the death term in the R compartment has no effect on our model ﬁ tting . The systems of differential equations for each model is given below : S ’ ¼ (cid:1) b IS I ’ ¼ b IS (cid:1) ð r þ m Þ I R ’ ¼ r I (cid:1) dR ( 2 ) S ’ ¼ (cid:1) b IS E ’ ¼ b IS (cid:1) ε E I ’ ¼ ε E (cid:1) ð r þ m Þ I R ’ ¼ r I (cid:1) dR ( 3 ) 3 . 2 . Model calibration from the data For data reliability , the data used for both models ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is the newly con ﬁ rmed cases in Wuhan city from the of ﬁ cial reports from January 21 to February 4 , 2020 ( National Health Commission of the People ’ s Republic of China , 2020 ) . It is common to use a Poisson or negative binomial probability model for observed count data . When the mean of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution is large , it approximates a normal distribution . Since the newly con ﬁ rmed cases are approaching large values quickly , the distribution of the count data will be approximately normal and the probability model for the observed count data in our study was assumed to a normal distributionwith mean given by r I and variance given by 1 = t . There are four parameters to be estimated in the SIR model from data : transmission rate b , diagnosis rate r , the initial population size I 0 for the compartment I on January 21 , 2019 ( t ¼ 0 ) , and the variance q ¼ 1 = t for the noise distribution in the Fig . 1 . Transfer diagrams for an SIR and an SEIR model for COVID - 19 in Wuhan . W . C . Roda et al . / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 275 data . There are six parameters to be estimated for the SEIR model : transfer rate ε from E to I , the initial population size E 0 for the latent compartment E on January 21 , 2019 , and b , r , I 0 , and q ¼ 1 = t . Since it was announced at a news conference by the mayor of Wuhan on January 23 that 5 million people have left the city by that date , we set the total population N ¼ S þ I þ R in Wuhan on January 21 to the conservative estimate of 6 million . We used the same uniform distributions over the initial range of parameters as the priors for both models , as given in Tables 1 and 2 . The af ﬁ ne invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to produce posterior distri - butions for all estimated parameters . From these posterior distributions , we obtain the best - ﬁ t values and the 95 % credible intervals , as given in Table 1 for the SIR model ( 2 ) and in Table 2 for the SEIR model ( 3 ) . 3 . 3 . Comparing SIR and SEIR models Using the calibration results for both the SIR and SEIR models in Section 3 . 3 , their corrected Akaike Information Criterion AIC c are calculated as 174 and 186 , respectively . The difference D ¼ 186 (cid:1) 174 ¼ 12 is suf ﬁ ciently large and this implies that using the SEIR model ( 3 ) will produce a signi ﬁ cant loss of information in comparison to using the SIR model ( 2 ) . Accordingly , our further investigation will be carried out using the SIR model ( 2 ) . 4 . Nonidenti ﬁ ability : linkage between transmission rate b and diagnosis rate r Based on our calibration results of the SIR model in Section 3 . 3 , we detected a linkage between the transmission rate b and the diagnosis rate r . In Fig . 2 ( a ) , we show the projection of the unnormalized posterior distribution in the b - r parameter Table 1 Parameters in the SIR model ( 2 ) and their estimations from the con ﬁ rmed case data .

Linkage between transmission rate b and diagnosis rate r . W . C . Roda et al . / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 276 space . It shows that the largest probability are concentrated along a ﬂ at strip rather than on a single point . Correspondingly , as shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) , a curve in the b - r parameter space can be determined such that every point on the curve has approxi - mately the same large probability . The linkage between two or more parameters implies the following : ( 1 ) the best - ﬁ t parameter values are effectively not unique ; and ( 2 ) there is a continuum of parameter values that cause the model to ﬁ t the data approximately equally as well . This phenomenon is often referred to as nonidenti ﬁ ability in the modeling literature . To further illustrate the signi ﬁ cant impact of nonidenti ﬁ ability on model predictions , we choose two endpoints on the curve in Fig . 2 ( b ) , with respective values ð b ; r Þ ¼ ð 2 : 09 e - 7 ; 0 : 909 Þ and ð b ; r Þ ¼ ð 7 : 34 e - 8 ; 0 : 084 Þ , and we plotted the corre - sponding projected new cases in Fig . 3 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . Fig . 3 shows that the peak height , as well as the duration and scale of the epidemic are different in the two projections , even though both choices of parameter values are effectivelyequally likely to produce the best ﬁ t between the model outcomes and the data . A striking feature in Fig . 3 is that the peak time of the two different projections are almost identical . This illustrates that , unlike the peak value , the peak time of the epidemic is insensitive to small parameter changes . This important property of the peak time will also be observed in later sections . We further note that the diagnosis rate r is the case - infection ratio that is used to discount of the number of infected individuals I ð t Þ to properly predict the newly con ﬁ rmed cases . The linkage between b and r re ﬂ ects the dependency of the transmission rate and the case - infection ratio , and hence the scale of the epidemic . We believe that this nonidenti ﬁ ability is the reason for the wide variability in published model predictions of COVID - 19 epidemic . To reduce the impact of nonidenti ﬁ ability in model calibration from data , one approach is to search for more independent data , including clinical , surveillance , or administrative data , and from published literature , that can be used for model cali - bration . This approach is often dif ﬁ cult when facing an outbreak of unknown pathogens that occur in real time such as SARS in 2003 and the current COVID - 19 . Another approach is to adopt better inference methods and model ﬁ tting algorithms to narrow done the otherwise large con ﬁ dence or credible intervals . Our ﬁ tting procedure using Bayesian inference and the af ﬁ ne invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was able to achieve this objective . 5 . Baseline predictions for Wuhan and three scenarios Our baseline predictions for Wuhan are prediction intervals produced by randomly sampling the posterior distribution . The best - ﬁ t parameter values and credible intervals are shown in Table 1 . The Bayesian inference used the newly con ﬁ rmed cases for Wuhan contained in the of ﬁ cial reports from January 21 to February 4 , 2020 . This is the period during the lockdown and travel restrictions in Wuhan , but before the further control measures that were undertaken in Wuhan after February 7 , 2020 , including the drastic increase in the available hospital beds and the door - to - door visits used to identify and quarantine suspected cases . These projections show our estimation for the hypothetical epidemic in Wuhan if further control measures after February 7 were not implemented . In Fig . 4 ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the distributions of the projected peak time and the estimated values of the control reproduction number R c . In Fig . 4 ( c ) , we show the projected time course of newly con ﬁ rmed cases in Wuhan together with its 95 % prediction interval . The ﬁ t of our model predictions and the newly - con ﬁ rmed case data is shown for the period between January 21 to February 4 in Fig . 4 ( d ) . Based on these projections , if the more restrictive control measures after February 7 in the city were not implemented , the most likely peak time would have occurred on February 27 , 2020 , with the 95 % credible interval from February 23 - March 6 . The median value of R c is 1 . 629 with the ﬁ rst quantile 1 . 414 and the third quantile 1 . 979 . By our projection , without the strict quarantine measures after February 7 , the peak case total would reach approximately 120 ; 000 , and the epidemic in Wuhan would not be over before mid - May of 2020 .

Roda et al . / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 277 At the time of this manuscript , the consensus among medical experts is that the basic reproduction number R 0 near the beginning of the COVID - 19 outbreak in Wuhan is around 2 . Our result in Fig . 4 ( b ) is comparable with earlier estimates and the current consensus . It also shows that , even without the more restrictive control measures in Wuhan undertaken after February 7 , the lockdown and travel restrictions in the city had slowed down the transmission and reduced the basic reproduction number to a control reproduction number R c with a mean value 1 . 629 . We will estimate the impact of the more restrictive control measures in Section 6 . The baseline prediction intervals are computed over a large credible interval of the diagnosis rate r , ð 0 : 0637 ; 0 : 909 Þ , which represents a wide range of assumptions on the case - infection ratio and the scale of the epidemic in Wuhan . We further restricted the parameter r to three narrower ranges : ð 0 : 02 ; 0 : 03 Þ , ð 0 : 05 ; 0 : 1 Þ , and ð 0 : 2 ; 1 Þ , and recalibrated the SIR model ( 2 ) with each of the r ranges . The resulting predictions for newly con ﬁ rmed cases are shown in Fig . 5 . Fig . 4 .

Day 0 in the simulations is set at January 21 , 2020 . W . C . Roda et al . / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 278 In Fig . 5 , different r ranges have resulted in signi ﬁ cant variations in the peak value of cases and the duration of the epidemic . In contrast , the projected peak times are very similar in all three cases , which further demonstrates that the peak time is insensitive to changes in parameters . 6 . Impacts of more strict quarantine measures in Wuhan after February 7 After February 7 , 2020 , Wuhan implemented more strict quarantine measures that included the following : locking down residential buildings and compounds , strict self quarantine for families , door - to - door inspection for suspected cases , quar - antining suspected cases and close contacts in newly established hospitals and other quarantine spaces including vacated hotels and university dormitories . The goal of these measures was to reduce transmissions within family clusters and resi - dential compounds . These measures have a direct impact on two parameters in our SIR model ( 2 ) : reducing the transmission rate b and increasing the diagnosis rate r : It is dif ﬁ cult to estimate the exact impacts on these parameters by these measures . We incorporated several likely scenarios of the effects of these measures byadjusting our baseline estimates of b and r and we plotted the resulting time courses in Fig . 6 . In Fig . 6 ( a ) , we see that a combination of a 10 % reduction in the transmission rate b and a 90 % increase in the diagnosis rate r can effectively stop the epidemic in its tracks , force the newly diagnosed cases to decline , and signi ﬁ cantly shorten the duration of the epidemic . 7 . Potential of a second outbreak in Wuhan after the return - to - work With newly diagnosed cases on the decline in Wuhan and other cities in China since February 14 , an urgent task for the authorities is to decide when to allow people to go back to work . Without lifting the ban on traf ﬁ c in and out of the city , we tested three hypotheses of allowing people to return to work in Wuhan at three different dates : February 24 , March 2 , and March 31 . As shown in Fig . 7 , our results predict a signi ﬁ cant second outbreak after the return - to - work day . 8 . Conclusions The COVID - 19 epidemics have presented China and many other countries in the world with an unprecedented public health challenge in the modern era , with a signi ﬁ cant impact on health and public health systems , human lives and national and world economies . Mathematical modeling is an important tool for estimating and predicting the scale and time course of epidemics , evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions , and informing public health policies . The focus of our study is to demonstrate the challenges facing modelers in predicting outbreaks of this nature and to provide a partial explanation for the wide variability in earlier model predictions of the COVID - 19 epidemic . Our study focused on the COVID - 19 epidemic in Wuhan city , the epicentre of the epidemic , during a less volatile period of the epidemic , after the lock down and quarantine of the city . By comparing standard SIR and SEIR models in predicting the epidemic using the Akaike Information Criterion , we showed that , given the same dataset of con ﬁ rmed cases , more complex models may not necessarily be more reliable in making predictions due to the larger number of model parameters to be estimated . Using a simple SIR model and the dataset of newly diagnosed cases in Wuhan for model calibration , we demonstrated that there is a linkage between the transmission rate b and the case - infection ratio r , which resulted in a continuum of best - ﬁ t parameter values , which can produce signi ﬁ cantly different model predictions of the epidemic . This is a hallmark of non - identi ﬁ ability , and the root cause for variabilities in model predictions . The nonidenti ﬁ ability should not be interpreted as a shortcoming of transmission models ; neither is it caused by the limited number of time points in data . Rather , it is caused by Fig . 6 . Predictions of the COVID - 19 epidemic in Wuhanwith more strict quarantine measures after February 7 , 2020 . Impacts of reductions in transmission rate b and increases in diagnosis rate r are shown in ( a ) . Impacts of only reducing the transmission rate ( b ) or only increasing the diagnosis rate ( c ) are also shown for comparison purposes . W . C . Roda et al . / Infectious Disease Modelling 5 ( 2020 ) 271 e 281 279 the lack of datasets that are independent of the conirmed cases to allow modelers to produce independent estimates of b and r . The reliability in model predictions depends on how rigorously the nonidenti ﬁ ability is addressed in model calibration and on the choice of parameter values . We demonstrated that Bayesian inference and an improved Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm , the af ﬁ ne invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm , can signi ﬁ cantly reduce the wide parameter ranges in the uniform prior and produce workable credible intervals , even in the presence of nonidenti ﬁ ability . We showed that the estimated credible in - tervals for the parameters are suf ﬁ ciently small to allow our credible interval for the peak time to fall within a week . We have further demonstrated that the peak time of the epidemic is much less sensitive to parameter variations than the peak values and the scale of the epidemic . This was also observed in our previous work on predicting seasonal in ﬂ uenza for the Province of Alberta . We estimated the impact of the Wuhan lockdown and traf ﬁ c restrictions in the city after January 23 and before February 6 , 2020 . We show that if the more restrictive control and prevention measures were not implemented in the city , the epidemic would peak between the end of February and ﬁ rst week of March of 2020 . Our results can be used to inform public health authorities on what may happen if the more strict quarantine measures after February 7 were not taken . When the more restrictive measures are incorporated into our model , including the lock down of residential buildings and compounds , the door - to - door search of suspected cases , and the quarantine of suspected cases and their close contacts in newlyestablished hospitals and quarantine spaces , we showed that these measures can effectively stop the otherwise surging epidemic in its tracks and signi ﬁ cantly reduce the duration of the epidemic . These ﬁ ndings provide a theoretical veri ﬁ cation of the effectiveness of these measures . We further considered the impact of the return - to - work order on different dates in February and March on the course of the outbreak . Our results show that a second peak in Wuhan is very likely even if the return - to - work happens near the end of March 2020 . This may serve as a warning to the public health authorities .
