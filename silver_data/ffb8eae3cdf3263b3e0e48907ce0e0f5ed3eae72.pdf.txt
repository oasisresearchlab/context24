LaBrie A Visual History of IS Research Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 1 Seeing 20 / 30 : A Visual History of Key ( word ) Insights from MIS Quarterly Completed Research Paper Ryan C . LaBrie Seattle Pacific University ryanl @ spu . edu Abstract As we celebrate the 20 th anniversary of AMCIS it seems appropriate to look back at what topics have helped shape the information systems ( IS ) discipline and what topics are emerging to further shape our discipline . This historical retrospect study contributes to the IS discipline specifically by incorporating visualization techniques on author provided keyword to gather additional insights into the research aspect of the IS field . Thirty years’ worth of keyword data , resulting in approximately 3500 usages , was collected from some 700 MIS Quarterly articles ( volumes 1 - 30 – years 1977 - 2006 ) to create both static and dynamic visualizations . These visualizations provide alternative mechanisms for “seeing” the history of the IS discipline . This research finds that while ‘Decision Support Systems’ may ( or may not ! ) have been the single largest topic within MISQ over its first 30 years , keyword synonyms and time are factors in understanding the diverse history of IS research . Keywords Information Visualization , IS History , IS Research , Keyword Analysis , MISQ , Text Mining Introduction Decades often seem to be good times for reflecting . We find this throughout academia and business both formally and informally through activities that range from reunions and anniversaries to special journal issues or conference tracks focused on historical retrospect . We have seen these reflection points in our highest regarded journals ( Culnan & Swanson , 1986 ; Mason , et al . , 1997a & b ; Vessey , et al . , 2002 ; Swanson , et al . , 2010 ) and at our top conferences ( Andoh - Baidoo , et al . , 2004 ; Becker , et al . , 2004 ; Palvia , et al . , 2004 ; Lim , et al . , 2009 ; Olbrich , 2009 ) . On this 20 anniversary of AMCIS we once again have reason to look back and devote some time reflecting on where we’ve been as a research discipline . As we look back we see that while AMCIS is celebrating its 20 th year , there are many other IS research outlets that have past major milestones . These outlets include : HICSS nearing 50 years ( first conference in 1968 ) , ICIS is over 30 years old ( first conference in 1980 ) , ECIS is over 20 years ( first conference in 1993 ) , MISQ is approaching 40 years ( first issue in 1977 ) , JMIS passes 30 this year ( first issue 1984 ) , and ISR turns a quarter of a century this year ( first issue 1990 ) . The primary purpose of this research is to use modern visualization techniques to uncover new insights into what IS researchers have historically chosen to study . As Hirschheim & Kline ( 2012 ) counsel , our field could use further historical analysis and that it is important for IS researchers to have a shared understanding of our history . Through these visualization tools we not only discover what has been the key research themes over the years , but can also identify which themes have run their course and which are new emerging themes . By using visualization tools , this research seeks to fulfill the age old adage that , “a picture is work a thousand words . ” See Diaz Andrade and Arthanari ( 2009 ) for further discussion on IS research and pictures . Furthermore , this research may be so bold as to suggest that , “a moving picture is worth more than a thousand words . ” In the age of ‘Big Data’ and information overload , visualization techniques bring new ways to quickly digest , make sense , and ultimately make more efficient and accurate decisions ( Tegarden , 1999 ; Keim , 2002 ; Few , 2009 ) . LaBrie Celebrating the 20 th Anniversary of AMCIS : Examining IS History 2 Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 This particular research aims to shed new light on our historic “view” of the Information Systems ( IS ) discipline via the examination of 30 years’ worth of data collected from one of the top research journals in our field , namely MIS Quarterly . A number of data visualization techniques will be employed including word clouds ( sometimes referred to as tag clouds ) represented by the freely available tool Wordle ( Feinberg , 2010 ) or other open source alternatives such as WordCram , for static visualizations ; and the time lapse tool Bubble Charts available in popular visualization tools such as Tableau and Microsoft Excel Power View for a dynamics / moving visualizations . The remainder of this paper is structured as follows : a brief literature review that includes context for what types of historic research has been done previously in the IS discipline and some examples of how visualization is being used in IS research . Next the research method for this study is discussed along with some inherent weaknesses of the data . The results section follows including sample visualizations . Then the paper concludes with summary statements , limitations , and avenues for further research . Prior Literature There have been a number of ways that researchers have approached historical analysis of the IS research discipline . These approaches can be categorized in the following way : Senior scholar reflections , citation analysis , and special focus analysis ( e . g . philosophical / theory development , methodological usages , and specialized subtopic reviews ) . Examples of each of these approaches are discussed below . Senior scholars have provided keen insights at key times throughout the 40 + year history of the IS discipline . Sometimes these insights are reflections on the early years of the discipline , journal , or conference ( Brancheau and Wetherbe , 1987 ; Banker and Kauffmann , 2004 ; Swanson , et al . , 2010 ; Zhang , et al . , 2013 ) . On occasion senior scholar have also prompted the IS research community with various charges , including but not limited to a call for more rigor , a call for more relevance , a call to tighten the discipline , a call for greater diversity within the discipline , and others charges ( Benbasat and Zmud , 1999 and 2003 ; Davenport and Markus , 1999 ; Lee , 1999 ; Watson , 1994 ; Watson et al . , 1997 ; George , et al . , 2005 ) . Citation analysis , or co - citation analysis has been a popular mechanism to analyze research in many disciplines , and is not limited to just the IS domain . Those that have performed citation analysis on IS research have focused primarily on author citation ( Culnan , 1987 ; Chen , et al . , 2001 ; Xu and Chau , 2006 ; Zhao and Strotmann , 2008 ; Wang , et al . , 2009 ) or article citation ( Aris , et al . , 2009 ; Leone , et al . , 2010 ; Mustafee , et al . , 2010 ; Rorissa and Yuan , 2012 ) . Findings from this body of research include trends in author - topic and author - author relationships , thematic research streams , and similar trends across different journals from different regions of the world ( Mustafee , 2011 ) . Then there are those that have focused on selected specialized subtopics / subfields within the IS domain . Agrawal , et al . ( 2010 ) focused on a review specifically around Human Computer Interaction ( HCI ) . Monod ( 2004 ) focused specifically on the contributions of French theories present in IS research . Olbrich ( 2009 ) focused on design science research within the IS domain . Steel , et al . ( 2007 ) investigate the philosophical foundations of our discipline and suggest that there is a need for putting the “systems” ( approach ) back into management information systems research , as well as a need for a deeper integration of ethics . Similarly , Taylor ( 2005 ) questions whether or not the IS discipline is ready to be called a paradigm yet . Lee , et al . ’s ( 1997 ) research investigated causal relationship in IS research and found the need for richer causal models . Palvia , et al . ’s ( 2004 ) meta - analysis found that survey research was the most popular , but mathematical models and laboratory experiments were close behind . Furthermore , their meta - analysis identified IS Usage , Resource Management , and Electronic Commerce as the most common subjects researched . Sidorova et al . ( 2008 ) performed and interesting text analysis study on a large sample of IS research article abstracts , determining five intellectual cores ( IS development , IT and individuals , IT and groups , IT and organizations , and IT and markets ) of IS research . Visualization Research in IS Throughout history the written word has been augmented with visual components to aid comprehension . The research community has recognized the benefits of visualizations and starting with simple tables have LaBrie A Visual History of IS Research Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 3 progressed visualizations far beyond the first colored charts . Our own IS research community historically has contributed to this body of knowledge ( Bačić and Fadlalla , 2013 ; Baker , et al . , 2013 ) . While it goes beyond the scope of this abbreviated view , we recognized the contributions of all those IS scholars who researched chart data , color , patterns , types , and proper axis values for minimal deception . Visualizations , historically have been about representing numeric data , however in recent years advances have been made to represent and incorporate text data ( Wise , 1999 ; Broeksema , et al . , 2013 ) . This has opened a whole new window into analyzing research . Visualizing content of documents provides new insights that aren’t available through quantitative analysis . Several researchers ( Chen et al . , 2001 ; Aris , et al . , 2009 ; Collins et al . , 2009 ; Dunne , et al . , 2012 , Rorissa , et al . , 2012 ) have used visualization on citations sources to determine research thematics and networks . Lim et al . ( 2009 ) use social network analysis ( SNA ) to identify key theories in the IS literature . Xu and Chau ( 20o6 ) use visualization techniques to map the collaboration networks of authors . Zhu , et al . ( 1999 ) were one of the earliest IS researchers to integrate visual mapping with text in a multimedia retrieval system for knowledge management . Ginsburg ( 2004 ) uses visualization techniques not on citations , but rather classification codes – similar to this research visualization on keywords . Only recently have IS researchers started to apply animation ( i . e . times series motion ) to visualization of text ( Leydesdorff and Shank , 2008 ) . Methodology Data for this research was collected from hard copies of the journal MIS Quarterly ( volumes one through 30 – years 1977 - 2006 ) in the case where the hard copy was not available the data was collected via the journal’s electronic document ( . pdf ) library available via subscription . Data was collected and stored in a relational database . Both the author and a research assistant verified the data entered in the database matched the original hard or electronic copy of the articles . Worthy of note was the fact that both the author and the research assistant found that the MISQ website itself and academic library research databases ( ABI / INFORM , Business Source Complete , and AISs eLibrary ) were not accurate enough for verification of correct keyword - article associations . Table 1 , below summarizes the data set as well as provides some basic descriptive statistics . Number of Issues 121 * ( 1982 had 5 issues ) Number of Articles 708 ( 704 with keywords ) Number of Unique Keyword Phrases 2099 Number of Keyword Phrase Usages 3476 Mean Number of Keyword Phrases per Article ( SD ) 4 . 9 ( 2 . 4 ) Range of Keywords Phrases per Article 0 - 18 ( 31 articles with 0 or 1 ) Mean Number of times a keyword phrase is used ( SD ) 1 . 7 ( 2 . 1 ) Table 1 . Keyword Data for MIS Quarterly Volumes 1 - 30 The Problem with Keywords Proper keyword phrases serve as a useful mechanism in knowledge work when discerning whether or not a researcher wants to utilize a particular article . Furthermore , when a researcher is looking for similar articles keywords can once again serve a role in finding related articles . Unfortunately author provided keyword phrases do come with several limitations . These limitations are outlined in Barki , et al . ( 1988 and 1993 ) , Qin ( 2000 ) , and LaBrie and St . Louis ( 2003 ) . These limitations include : the infrequent use of any given keyword or classification code , ambiguity ( or synonyms and stems – discussed later ) , use of LaBrie Celebrating the 20 th Anniversary of AMCIS : Examining IS History 4 Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 special characters ( parenthesis , dashes , slashes , etc . ) , or simply being too long . Classification schemes were meant to resolve many of the problems that keyword phrases produced , but as it turned out classification schemes suffered many of the same problems , including the biggest problem of little overlap except on a select few topics . MIS Quarterly has gone through at least three different classification schemes over the years and as of volume 27 , issue 3 ( 2003 ) have dropped them all together as have most IS journals . Table 2 ( below ) shows just how scarcely a keyword phrase is used . LaBrie and St . Louis ( 2003 ) show parallel results for classification schemes . Number of Times a Keyword Phrase was Utilized Percent Used Only Once 1579 75 . 2 % Used Twice 292 13 . 9 % Used More Than Twice 228 10 . 9 % TOTAL 2099 100 . 0 % Table 2 . Frequency of Keyword Phrases in MIS Quarterly Volumes 1 - 30 Once all keyword phrases were verified correct , along with additional associated data ( article , title , year / volume / issue , etc . ) in the relational database , transfer to the two visualization tools ( Wordle for static visualizations and Microsoft Excel Power View for dynamic / moving visualizations ) were performed by simple query export commands . Results Wordle is a very useful and easy to use tool for text visualization ( Feinberg , 2010 ) . One simply transfers one’s data into a website running a java application , and out comes a word cloud . Wordle works by weighing the frequency of a word ( or phrase in certain instances ) in determining the size of the word’s ( or phrase’s ) output . Note the user of Worldle has limited capability for changes to the word cloud produced ( basically font , color , and orientation choices only ) . Users do not have control of position of outputted words . Figure 1 shows a first attempt at putting all 3476 keyword phrases into a Wordle word cloud . Figure 1 . 30 Years of MIS Quarterly Keywords This first past provides an initial view of words that are important to IS researcher , however one needs to be careful about the interpretation . One would expect to see the terms ; management , information , and systems , yet there is really no need to see the words ‘of’ and ‘and’ so prominently displayed . Furthermore , LaBrie A Visual History of IS Research Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 5 many of these words are represented larger than they need to be because they occur in many of the keyword phrases – ‘Data’ is clearly an example of this . The keyword phrase ‘Data’ by itself is only used twice in 3476 usages , but it is also a part of 41 other keyword phrases . Another thing to remember is that Figure 1 shows words not phrases . That is , while you can see ‘Decision’ and ‘Support’ and ‘Systems’ , you don’t see ‘Decision Support Systems’ – the number one keyword phrase in the data set . The good news is Wordle has options to solve both of these problems – removing common words ( e . g . of , the , a , and , etc . ) and keeping word phrases together . Figure 2 shows a cleaned up Wordle word cloud based on keyword phrases . Figure 2 . 30 Years of MIS Quarterly Keyword Phrases Now we begin to see the important keyword phrases come into focus . Looking back at Figure 1 , one might have not been able to discern that ‘Knowledge Management’ or ‘Business Value of IT’ were important concepts to the IS research community , but in Figure 2 they are clearly identifiable . Displaying 2099 unique keyword phrases is still visually information overload and just too much to take in . Wordle will drop the smallest phrases ( those with the smallest counts ) , but sometimes some additional proactive pruning is helpful . Figure 3 shows a final version where just the top 50 keyword phrases ( remember that 75 % of the keyword phrases were used only once , and nearly 90 % of the keyword phrases were used only once or twice , an thus are mostly irrelevant for showing significant trends in IS research . Figure 3 . Top 50 Keyword Phrases in the First 30 Years of MIS Quarterly This final Wordle word cloud shown in Figure 3 now provides a very clear picture of the top keyword phrases in this data set relative to each other . LaBrie Celebrating the 20 th Anniversary of AMCIS : Examining IS History 6 Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 Are We Seeing Clearly Yet ? The Synonym / Stemming Problem While static text visualizations such as Wordle word clouds may help us see the “big picture” of IS research , at least in regards to author supplied keyword classification , they are not without some limitations . The text visualization literature discusses a significant problem of synonyms , and its related cousin , stemming . Here is an example from our current working data set . Consider the keyword phrases ‘Decision Support Systems’ and ‘Management Information Systems’ . Decision Support Systems ( with 33 hits versus Management Information Systems with 22 ) was the top keyword phrase in the first 30 years of MIS Quarterly articles . But was it really the most common topic ? Table 3 compares Decision Support Systems ( and its variants ) against Management Information Systems and its variants . Decision Support Systems Management Information Systems Decision Support Systems ( original ) 33 Management Information Systems ( original ) 22 Decision Support System 5 MIS * ( 47 other phrases with MIS in them ) 16 Decision Support System ( DSS ) 2 Management of Information Systems 10 Information Management Systems 8 Management Information System 3 TOTAL 40 TOTAL 59 Table 3 . DSS Versus MIS a Synonym / Stemming Problem From Table 3 we see that MIS and its variants are nearly 50 % more common that DSS and its variants . Currently available text visualizations tools , such as Wordle , are not sophisticated enough to handle synonym / stemming issues at this time . Moving Along , Visualization Over Time Wordle has provided us with an effective word cloud visualization in which we can quickly discern the ‘hot’ topics in IS research ( at least according to MISQ for this data set ) , or does it ? Wordle’s static representation of importance ( size based on count ) may not express the whole truth . Yes , ‘Decision Support Systems’ is the largest single keyword phrase ( notwithstanding the synonym / stemming problem ) however , a prudent question to ask is , when did it get so big ? As it turns out Decision Support Systems first emerged as a keyword in 1978 , peaking in 1985 , and its most recent use was in 1992 ( in this data set ) – over 20 years ago . So while it is a big topic , more accurately it was a big topic a number of years ago . There do exist a variety of graphing techniques that represent data well over time ( e . g . the line charts ) , but sometimes movement can provide additional insight above and beyond a static visualization . When viewing data in a time series bubble chart within a tool such as Microsoft Excel’s Power View extension new knowledge can be perceived . Through the time series play function , we can watch the rise and fall of keyword phrases coming into existence and fading out of popular usage . Figure 4 shows four snapshots collected during the playing of the animation from the data set of keyword phrases . The years 1985 , 1987 , 1993 , and 2006 were selected semi - randomly as good representations of the play as they had some of the larger spreads of keyword usage . LaBrie A Visual History of IS Research Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 7 Figure 4 . Snapshots of a Motion Visualization of MIS Quarterly Keywords Over 30 Years Figures 5 - 7 show concentrated views of the motion visualizations by allowing a focus to be put on a single keyword phrase . In these focused views , one keyword phrase is highlighted , the rest dim to the background , but don’t disappear , so you can see what is going on around your focal piece of data . For example we can see the popularity and decline of ‘Decision Support Systems’ as a keyword by the early 1990s in Figure 5 . In Figure 6 we see the lasting endurance of ‘Information Systems’ as a keyword phrase over the years . Furthermore , one can detect the rising popularity of ‘Knowledge Management’ late in the data set in Figure 7 . LaBrie Celebrating the 20 th Anniversary of AMCIS : Examining IS History 8 Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 Figure 5 . Movement of ‘Decision Support Systems’ Over Time One of the benefits of having a single focus turned on for an item is you not only see its counts year over year ( Y - axis ) and its growth ( size of bubble ) , but also many tools will use lines to show continuity from year to year . Breaks in the lines mean no data for at least one year . In Figure 5 you observe that ‘Decision Support Systems’ was first used in 1978 and continued to be used every year except 1983 until 1992 when it abruptly ends ( within this MIS Quarterly data set ) . Figure 6 . Movement of ‘Information Systems’ Over Time ‘Information Systems’ movement ( Figure 6 ) is an interesting topics to follow because , besides being the second most popular topic ( 31 hits ) , it is also tied for the most years as a keyword phrase ( 16 years ) along with ‘Systems Development’ and ‘Implementation’ . Once again you can follow the lines for consecutive years . LaBrie A Visual History of IS Research Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 9 Figure 7 . Movement of ‘Knowledge Management’ Over Time Whether this time series was played all the way through , or with special focus just on ‘Knowledge Management’ , one of the new pieces of information we learn from this moving visualization is that ‘Knowledge Management’ has the most hits in a single year ( highest point on the Y - axis ) . This unusually high count for a single keyword typically indicates a special issue on that topic – which hold true in this case as well , in that MIS Quarterly , volume 29 , issue 2 ( June 2005 ) the special issue topic was , ‘Information Technologies and Knowledge Management’ . Figures 5 - 7 represent just three ways motion visualization can enlighten the IS researcher in ways that might be hard to perceive with traditional static visualizations or basic tables . Conclusion The contributions of this study include new “views” of IS research history via the analysis of keywords through visualization tools which provide a rich new way of “seeing” our discipline . Furthermore , this research provides details of the IS research artifact by going beyond simple database queries and output tables of top keywords as an indication of what IS research is happening now . For example , we’ve learned that our most researched topic ( Decision Support Systems ) is not the most important topic now , that it occupied a place in history ( between 1978 and 1992 in this data set ) . It was the motion of visualization that helped us see that knowledge management what just getting its legs at the end of this data set , as opposed to some other topic of similar size that happened 25 years ago . A key limitation of this research is its generalizability to the entire IS field based on a single journal as the source of the data . The author ( s ) recognize this and plan future research to include a more robust data set , utilizing several sources . Furthermore , an additional issue to recognize is the fact that we as researchers simply do not reuse keywords frequently enough . Whether it is due to the ever changing face of our discipline or our personal desire to show creativity and recreate the proverbial wheel , we just don’t have a lot of overlapping keywords . In future research , besides increasing the data from other sources , another approach one might investigate is to use these same ( or similar ) visualization techniques and apply them to other attributes / content of these research items . For example , one might similarly investigate article titles , abstracts , or full text and compare those visualizations to see if they correlate with the author chosen keywords . This sort of research would test if the keywords really represented the content of the articles , or might the title or abstract content actually prove to be a better representation . Finally there are tools out there that provide linkages between word clouds and underlying content , it would be wonderful to put LaBrie Celebrating the 20 th Anniversary of AMCIS : Examining IS History 10 Twentieth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Savannah , 2014 these together in a knowledge management systems and see if there are better information retrieval results .
