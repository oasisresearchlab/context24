This paper considers the existence of conformally compact Einstein metrics on 4 - manifolds . A reasonably complete understanding is obtained for the existence of such metrics with prescribed conformal inﬁnity , when the conformal inﬁnity is of positive scalar curvature . We ﬁnd in particular that general solvability depends on the topology of the ﬁlling manifold . The obstruction to extending these results to arbitrary boundary values is also identiﬁed . While most of the paper concerns dimension 4 , some general results on the structure of the space of such metrics hold in all dimensions . 1 . Introduction . This paper is concerned with the existence of conformally compact Einstein metrics on a given manifold M with boundary ∂M . The main results are restricted to dimension 4 , although some of the results hold in all dimensions . This existence problem was raised by Feﬀerman and Graham in [ 19 ] in connection with a study of conformal invariants of Riemannian manifolds . More recently , the study of such metrics has become of strong interest through the AdS / CFT correspondence , relating gravitational theories on M with conformal ﬁeld theories on ∂M , cf . [ 18 ] , [ 38 ] and references therein . Let M be a compact , oriented manifold with non - empty boundary ∂M ; M is assumed to be connected , but apriori ∂M may be connected or disconnected . A deﬁning function ρ for ∂M in M is a non - negative C ∞ function on the closure ¯ M = M ∪ ∂M such that ρ − 1 ( 0 ) = ∂M and dρ 6 = 0 on ∂M . A complete Riemannian metric g on M is conformally compact if there is a deﬁning function ρ such that the conformally equivalent metric ( 1 . 1 ) e g = ρ 2 · g extends at least continuously to a Riemannian metric e g on ¯ M . The metric γ = e g | ∂M induced on ∂M is the boundary metric induced by g and the compactiﬁcation ρ . Any compact manifold with boundary carries many conformally compact metrics ; for instance , one may let e g be any smooth metric on ¯ M and deﬁne g by g = ρ − 2 · e g , for any choice of deﬁning function ρ . Deﬁning functions for ∂M are unique only up to multiplication by positive smooth functions on ¯ M and hence the compactiﬁcation ( 1 . 1 ) is not uniquely determined by ( M , g ) . On the other hand , the conformal class [ γ ] of a boundary metric is uniquely determined by g ; the class [ γ ] is called the conformal inﬁnity of ( M , g ) . A conformal compactiﬁcation is called C m , α or L k , p if the metric e g extends to a C m , α or L k , p metric on the closure ¯ M ; here C m , α and L k , p are the usual H¨older and Sobolev function spaces . In this paper , we consider complete conformally compact Einstein metrics g on ( n + 1 ) - dimensional manifolds M , normalized so that ( 1 . 2 ) Ric g = − ng . Partially supported by NSF Grant DMS 0604735 . 1 It is easy to see , cf . the Appendix , that any C 2 conformally compact Einstein metric g satisﬁes | K g + 1 | = O ( ρ 2 ) , where K g denotes the sectional curvature of g . Hence , such metrics are asymptotically hyperbolic ( AH ) , in that the local geometry tends to that of hyperbolic space at inﬁnity . Let E AH = E m , α AH be the space of AH Einstein metrics on M which admit a C m , α compactiﬁcation e g as in ( 1 . 1 ) . We require that m ≥ 3 , α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) but otherwise allow any value of m , including m = ∞ or m = ω , ( for real - analytic ) . The space E m , α AH is given the C m , α ′ topology on metrics on ¯ M , for any ﬁxed α ′ < α , via a ﬁxed compactiﬁcation as in ( 1 . 1 ) . Let E AH = E AH / D 1 ( ¯ M ) , where D 1 ( ¯ M ) is the group of orientation preserving C m + 1 , α diﬀeomorphisms of ¯ M inducing the identity on ∂M , acting on E AH in the usual way by pullback . As boundary data , let Met ( ∂M ) = Met m , α ( ∂M ) be the space of C m , α metrics on ∂M and C = C m , α ( ∂M ) the corresponding space of pointwise conformal classes , as above endowed with the C m , α ′ topology . There is a natural boundary map , ( for any ﬁxed ( m , α ) ) , Π : E AH → C ( 1 . 3 ) Π [ g ] = [ γ ] , which takes an AH Einstein metric g on M to its conformal inﬁnity on ∂M . It is proved in [ 7 ] that when dimM = 4 , and π 1 ( M , ∂M ) = 0 , the space E m , α AH is a C ∞ inﬁnite dimensional Banach manifold , and the boundary map Π is C ∞ of Fredholm index 0 , provided E m , α AH is non - empty . Moreover , the spaces E m , α AH are essentially independent of ( m , α ) , in that these spaces are all diﬀeomorphic , with E m ′ , α ′ AH dense in E m , α AH whenever m ′ + α ′ > m + α . Essentially the same results also hold in in all dimensions n + 1 ≥ 4 , see § 2 for a more detailed discussion . The issues of existence and uniqueness of AH Einstein metrics with a given conformal inﬁnity are thus equivalent to the surjectivity and injectivity of the boundary map Π . The main result of the paper which is used to approach the existence question is the following . Let C o be the space of non - negative conformal classes [ γ ] on ∂M , in the sense that [ γ ] has a non - ﬂat representative γ of non - negative scalar curvature . Let E oAH = Π − 1 ( C o ) be the space of AH Einstein metrics on M with conformal inﬁnity in C o . Thus , one has the restricted boundary map Π o = Π | E oAH : E oAH → C o . Theorem A . Let M be a 4 - manifold satisfying π 1 ( M , ∂M ) = 0 and for which the inclusion ι : ∂M → ¯ M induces a surjection ( 1 . 4 ) H 2 ( ∂M , F ) → H 2 ( ¯ M , F ) → 0 , for all ﬁelds F . Then for any ( m , α ) , m ≥ 4 , the boundary map ( 1 . 5 ) Π o : E oAH → C o is proper . Unfortunately ( or fortunately ) , the boundary map Π is not proper in general . In fact , a sequence of distinct AH Einstein metrics { g i } on M = R 2 × T 2 was constructed in [ 6 ] , whose conformal inﬁnity is an arbitrary ﬁxed ﬂat metric on ∂M = T 3 , but which has no convergent subsequence to an AH Einstein metric on M . These metrics are twisted versions of the AdS T 2 black hole metrics , cf . Remark 2 . 6 . The sequence { g i } converges , ( in a natural sense ) , to a complete hyperbolic cusp metric ( 1 . 6 ) g C = dr 2 + e 2 r g T 3 on the manifold N = R × T 3 . Since the boundary metric on T 3 is ﬂat and M satisﬁes ( 1 . 4 ) , Theorem A is sharp , at least without further restrictions . We will show in Theorem 5 . 4 that this behavior is the only way that Π is non - proper , in that divergent sequences { g i } of AH Einstein metrics on a ﬁxed 4 - manifold M and with a ﬁxed conformal 2 inﬁnity not in C o , ( or a convergent sequence of conformal inﬁnities outside C o ) , necessarily converge to AH Einstein manifolds ( N , g ) with cusps , although the cusps are not necessarily of the simple form ( 1 . 6 ) . Thus , the completion ¯ E AH of E AH in a natural topology consists of AH Einstein metrics on M , together with AH Einstein metrics with cusps , cf . Theorem 5 . 4 and Corollary 5 . 5 for further details . Using this , we show in Corollary 5 . 6 that the boundary map Π is proper onto the subset ˆ C of C consisting of conformal classes which are not the boundary metrics of AH Einstein metrics with cusps . The inﬁnite sequence of AH Einstein metrics g i on R 2 × T 2 above all lie in distinct components of the space E AH , so that this space has inﬁnitely many components . On the other hand , the fact that Π o is proper of course implies that E oAH has only ﬁnitely many components mapping into any compact region of C o . The topological condition ( 1 . 4 ) is used solely to rule out orbifold degenerations of AH Einstein sequences { g i } . This condition may not be necessary , but it has been included in order to not overly complicate the paper ; some situations where it is not needed are described in § 7 , cf . Remark 7 . 4 . Similarly it may well be possible to weaken or drop the condition π 1 ( M , ∂M ) = 0 on the fundamental group , but this will not be pursued further here . Theorem A implies that at least on E oAH , the map Π o is a proper Fredholm map of index 0 . It follows from a result of Smale [ 34 ] that Π o has a well - deﬁned mod 2 degree , deg 2 Π o ∈ Z 2 , on each component of E oAH . In fact , building on the work of Tromba [ 35 ] and White [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] we show in Theorem 6 . 1 that Π o has a Z - valued degree ( 1 . 7 ) deg Π o ∈ Z , again on components of E oAH . Tautologically , if deg Π o 6 = 0 , then Π o is surjective . We compute deg Π o in certain cases via symmetry arguments . Namely , it is proved in [ 8 ] , ( cf . also Theorem 2 . 5 below ) that any connected group of isometries of the conformal inﬁnity [ γ ] on ∂M extends to a group of isometries of any AH Einstein ﬁlling metric ( M , g ) , with Π [ g ] = [ γ ] , in any dimension , again provided π 1 ( M , ∂M ) = 0 . Using this , and a straightforward classiﬁcation of Einstein metrics with large symmetry groups leads to the following result . Theorem B . Let M = B 4 be the 4 - ball , with ∂M = S 3 , and , ( abusing notation slightly ) , let C o be the component of the non - negative C m , α conformal classes containing the round metric on S 3 . Also let E oAH be the component of Π − 1 ( C o ) containing the Poincar´e metric on B 4 . Then ( 1 . 8 ) deg B 4 Π o = 1 . In particular , for any ( m , α ) , m ≥ 4 , any conformal class [ γ ] ∈ C o on S 3 is the conformal inﬁnity of an AH Einstein metric on B 4 . Explicit examples of AH Einstein metrics on B 4 , whose the conformal inﬁnity is an arbitrary Berger sphere , were constructed by Pedersen [ 32 ] . More generally , Hitchin [ 26 ] has constructed such metrics with conformal inﬁnity an arbitrary left - invariant metric on S 3 . It remains an open question whether the boundary map Π is surjective onto all of C when M = B 4 . Based on reasoning from the AdS / CFT correspondence , Witten [ 38 ] has remarked that this may not be the case . It appears that physically , the natural class of boundary metrics are those of positive scalar curvature ; in this regard , see also the work of Witten - Yau [ 39 ] proving that ∂M is necessarily connected when the conformal inﬁnity has a component of positive scalar curvature . In any case , as remarked above in connection with Theorem 5 . 4 , the only obstruction to surjectivity is the possible existence of AH Einstein cusp metrics associated to B 4 , cf . also Remark 6 . 8 . Theorem B also holds when M is a disc bundle over S 2 , so that ∂M = S 3 / Z k , provided k ≥ 10 , with again C o the component containing the standard round metric on S 3 / Z k , cf . Proposition 7 . 6 . 3 We conjecture this result holds for any k ≥ 3 . However , for M = S 2 × R 2 , ( i . e . k = 0 ) , it is shown in Proposition 7 . 2 , that ( 1 . 9 ) deg R 2 × S 2 Π o = 0 , and further that Π o is not surjective onto C o . In fact , the conformal class of S 2 ( 1 ) × S 1 ( L ) , for any L > 2 π / √ 3 is not the boundary metric of any AH Einstein metric on S 2 × R 2 . This result is based on the work of Hawking - Page [ 23 ] on the AdS - Schwarzschild metric . Similarly , for M the degree 1 disc bundle over S 2 , i . e . M = CP 2 \ B 4 , as well as the degree 2 disc bundle , Π o is not surjective . These results for Π o on disc bundles use properties of the AdS - Taub Bolt metrics analysed in [ 24 ] , [ 31 ] . These results and others on deg Π o are given in § 7 . Theorem B and the related results above represent the ﬁrst global results on an existence theory for complete Einstein metrics , outside the context of K¨ahler - Einstein metrics .

Thanks also to the referees for a careful examination of the paper leading to improvements in the exposition . 2 . Background Results In this section , we discuss a number of background results from [ 6 ] - [ 8 ] , [ 11 ] [ 19 ] , [ 21 ] needed for the work to follow . We begin with the structure of the moduli space E m , α AH of C m , α conformally compact Einstein metrics on a given ( n + 1 ) - dimensional manifold M . The results discussed below are from [ 7 ] . Let E m , α AH be the space of AH Einstein metrics on M which have a C m , α conformal compactiﬁ - cation with respect to a smooth ( or C ω ) deﬁning function ρ , as in ( 1 . 1 ) . The space E m , α AH is given the C m , α ′ topology on the space of C m , α metrics Met m , α ( ¯ M ) on ¯ M , for some α ′ < α . Thus , a neighborhood of g ∈ E m , α AH is deﬁned to be the set of metrics g ′ whose compactiﬁcation e g ′ by ρ lie in a neighborhood of e g in Met m , α ( ¯ M ) , where Met m , α ( ¯ M ) is given the C m , α ′ topology . Let Met m , α be the corresponding space of metrics on ∂M , again with the C m , α ′ topology . One thus has a natural boundary map ( 2 . 1 ) Π = Π m , α : E m , α AH → Met m , α ( ∂M ) , sending g to its boundary metric γ . An element [ g ] in the moduli space E m , α AH is an equivalence class of a C m , α conformally compact Einstein metric g on M , where g ∼ g ′ if g ′ = φ ∗ g , with φ a C m + 1 , α diﬀeomorphism of ¯ M , equal to the identity on ∂M , i . e . φ ∈ D 1 . Changing g by a diﬀeomorphism in D 1 , or changing the deﬁning function ρ in ( 1 . 1 ) changes the boundary metric conformally . Hence if C m , α denotes the space of conformal classes of C m , α metrics on ∂M , then the boundary map ( 2 . 2 ) Π = Π m , α : E m , α AH → C m , α is well deﬁned . When there is no danger of confusion , we will usually work with any given repre - sentative g ∈ [ g ] and γ ∈ [ γ ] . Suppose dimM = n + 1 = 4 , and the 4 - manifold M satisﬁes π 1 ( M , ∂M ) = 0 . Then if E m , α AH is non - empty , the spaces E m , α AH and E m , α AH are C ∞ inﬁnite dimensional separable Banach manifolds , and the boundary maps Π in ( 2 . 1 ) and ( 2 . 2 ) are C ∞ smooth maps of Banach manifolds , of Fredholm index 0 . This result holds for any m ≥ 3 , and α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , and , replacing Banach by Fr´echet , also for m = ∞ and m = ω , ( i . e . the real - analytic case ) . Implicit in this statement is the following boundary regularity result : an AH Einstein metric with a C 2 conformal compactiﬁcation which has a C m , α boundary metric , m ≥ 2 , has a C m , α conformal compactiﬁcation . 4 In addition , the spaces E m , α AH are all diﬀeomorphic and for any ( m ′ , α ′ ) with m ′ + α ′ > m + α , the space E m ′ , α ′ AH is dense in E m , α AH . In particular , ( 2 . 3 ) E ωAH = E m , α AH , where the completion is taken in the C m , α ′ topology . If dimM = n + 1 > 4 , then these results hold when 3 ≤ m ≤ n − 1 , using the boundary regularity results in [ 30 ] . In addition , the smooth manifold result holds when m = ∞ , if , when n is even , E ∞ AH is understood to be the space of AH Einstein metrics which are C ∞ polyhomogeneous ; this uses the boundary regularity result of [ 16 ] , cf . also the discussion following ( 2 . 10 ) below . Let S m , α ( ¯ M ) denote the space of C m , α symmetric bilinear forms on ¯ M , and similarly for M and ∂M . A tangent vector h to the Banach manifold E m , α AH at a representative g ∈ [ g ] , i . e . an inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformation of g , is a form h ∈ S m , α ( ¯ M ) satisfying the equation ( 2 . 4 ) L ( h ) = 12 D ∗ Dh − R ( h ) = 0 , β g ( h ) = 0 , where R is the action of the curvature tensor of g on symmetric bilinear forms and β g = δ g + 12 dtr g is the Bianchi operator with respect to g . Such h are transverse to the orbits of the diﬀeomorphism group D 1 acting on ¯ M . Let T g E m , α AH denote the space of such tangent vectors . An Einstein metric ( M , g ) is non - degenerate if the operator L has no kernel in L 2 ( M , g ) , ( 2 . 5 ) K = L 2 − KerL = 0 . For g ∈ E m , α AH , the L 2 kernel K equals the kernel of the linear map D Π : T g E m , α AH → T Π ( g ) C m , α . Hence , g is non - degenerate if and only if g is a regular point of the boundary map Π and thus Π is a local diﬀeomorphism near g . Any element κ ∈ K is transverse - traceless , i . e . ( 2 . 6 ) δ g κ = 0 , tr g κ = 0 , and so satisﬁes the Bianchi gauge condition ( 2 . 4 ) . In the next sections , we will frequently consider compactiﬁcations ¯ g of g by a geodesic deﬁning function t , for which ( 2 . 7 ) t ( x ) = dist ¯ g ( x , ∂M ) . A compactiﬁcation ¯ g = t 2 g satisfying ( 2 . 7 ) is called a geodesic compactiﬁcation and t is a geodesic deﬁning function . Such compactiﬁcations are natural from a number of viewpoints . In particular the curvature of ¯ g has a particularly simple form ; this and related issues are discussed in the the Appendix . It is not diﬃcult to see that given a C 2 conformally compact Einstein metric g with boundary metric γ in some compactiﬁcation , there is a unique geodesic compactiﬁcation ¯ g of g with boundary metric γ . Further if e g is some C m , α compactiﬁcation , then then the geodesic compactiﬁcation ¯ g is at least C m − 1 , α oﬀ the cutlocus ¯ C of ∂M in ( M , ¯ g ) . Since the integral curves of ¯ ∇ t are geodesics , the metric ¯ g splits as ( 2 . 8 ) ¯ g = dt 2 + g t , within a collar neighborhood U ( inside the cutlocus ) of ∂M ; here g t is a curve of metrics on the boundary ∂M with g 0 = γ . Setting r = − log t , a simple calculation shows that the integral curves of ∇ r are also geodesics in ( M , g ) and so the metric g also splits as g = dr 2 + g r . The Feﬀerman - Graham expansion [ 19 ] is the formal expansion of the curve g t in a Taylor - like series : the speciﬁc form of the expansion depends on n . If dimM = n + 1 is even , then the expansion reads ( 2 . 9 ) g t ∼ g ( 0 ) + t 2 g ( 2 ) + · · · + t n − 1 g ( n − 1 ) + t n g ( n ) + · · · , where the coeﬃcients are symmetric bilinear forms on ∂M . The expansion is in even powers of t up to order n − 1 and the terms g ( 2 k ) are intrinsically determined by the boundary metric γ = g ( 0 ) 5 and its tangential derivatives up to order 2 k , for 2 k ≤ n − 1 . The term g ( n ) is transverse - traceless ; however , beyond this , g ( n ) is not locally determined by γ ; it depends on global properties of the Einstein metric ( M , g ) . For example , when n = 3 , one has g ( 3 ) = 16 ¯ ∇ N ¯ Ric , where ¯ Ric is the Ricci curvature and N = ¯ ∇ t is the unit normal of ∂M in ( ¯ M , ¯ g ) . This term is not computable in terms of γ ; it depends on the global properties of ( M , g ) . On the other hand , the higher terms g ( k ) , k > n depend on two tangential derivatives of g ( k − 2 ) . If dimM = n + 1 is even , then the expansion is ( 2 . 10 ) g t ∼ g ( 0 ) + t 2 g ( 2 ) + . . . + t n g ( n ) + t n ( log t ) H + · · · , where again this is an even expansion up to order n , with coeﬃcients up to order ( n − 2 ) locally determined by γ . The term H , called the obstruction tensor in [ 19 ] , is naturally identiﬁed as the stress - energy tensor of the integral L of the conformal anomaly , ( see ( 2 . 16 ) below ) , via the AdS / CFT correspondence , cf . [ 18 ] , [ 33 ] ; it is transverse - traceless and also locally determined by γ . The trace and divergence of g ( n ) are determined by γ ; in fact there is a symmetric bilinear form r ( n ) and scalar function a ( n ) , both explicitly computable from γ and its derivatives , such that ( 2 . 11 ) δ ( g ( n ) + r ( n ) ) = 0 , tr ( g ( n ) + r ( n ) ) = a ( n ) . The term a ( n ) is the conformal anomaly , ( so that R ∂M a ( n ) = L ) . However , as above , g ( n ) is otherwise only globally determined by ( M , g ) . The higher order terms in ( 2 . 10 ) contain terms of the form t m ( log t ) p . The expansion is even in powers of t , and each coeﬃcient g ( k ) , k 6 = n , depends on two derivatives of g ( k − 2 ) . Note that ( 2 . 11 ) also holds when n is odd , in which case r ( n ) = a ( n ) = 0 . In both cases , all terms in the expansion are thus determined by the two terms g ( 0 ) and g ( n ) or τ ( n ) . Let ( 2 . 12 ) τ ( n ) = g ( n ) + r ( n ) , so that τ ( n ) is divergence - free . This term will play an important role thoughout much of the paper , in particular in § 4 . In the AdS / CFT correspondence τ ( n ) corresponds , ( up to a constant ) , to the stress - energy tensor of the corresponding CFT on ∂M , cf . ( 2 . 19 ) below . The boundary regularity results of [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 16 ] discussed above give the existence of the formal series ( 2 . 9 ) and ( 2 . 10 ) ; in the C ∞ case , these are well - deﬁned asympotic series for the curve g t . If the data ( g ( 0 ) , g ( n ) ) are real - analytic , a result of Kichenassamy [ 28 ] shows that the series ( 2 . 9 ) and ( 2 . 10 ) converge to g t , so that such data determine a solution to the Einstein equations deﬁned in a neighborhood of ∂M . The next local unique continuation result from [ 8 ] shows that the terms g ( 0 ) and g ( n ) uniquely determine an AH Einstein metric up to isometry , near the boundary . Proposition 2 . 1 . Let g 1 and g 2 be two Einstein metrics deﬁned on a half - ball U ≃ ( R n + 1 ) + , which have a C 3 , α conformal compactiﬁcation to the closed half - ball ¯ U . If ( 2 . 13 ) | g 1 − g 2 | = o ( t n ) , where t is the distance to ∂U ≃ R n , ( in either compactiﬁed metric ) , then g 1 is isometric to g 2 in U . Of course ( 2 . 13 ) holds if g 1 and g 2 are C n polyhomogeneous conformally compact with identical g ( 0 ) and g ( n ) terms . Since Einstein metrics are real - analytic in local harmonic coordinates , local unique continuation in the interior , away from the boundary , is well - known . Observe that the terms g ( k ) depend on the choice of the boundary metric γ ∈ [ γ ] . If e γ = λ 2 γ , then the coeﬃcients e g ( k ) are determined explicitly by λ and γ , cf . [ 18 ] . For n odd , the tranformation 6 rule for the undetermined coeﬃcient g ( n ) has the simple form ( 2 . 14 ) e g ( n ) = λ − ( n − 2 ) g ( n ) . In particular | e g ( n ) | e g = λ − n | g ( n ) | g . For n even , the transformation rule is more complicated ; it has the form ( 2 . 14 ) at leading order , but has lower order terms depending explicitly on the derivatives of γ and λ . Exact formulas in low dimensions are given in [ 18 ] , [ 33 ] . Next we consider certain global issues associated with AH Einstein metrics which arise via the AdS / CFT correspondence . Let g be an AH Einstein metric on an ( n + 1 ) - manifold M with boundary metric γ , and such that the corresponding geodesic compactiﬁcation is at least C n in the polyhomogeneous sense . The expansions ( 2 . 9 ) - ( 2 . 10 ) easily lead to an expansion for the volume of the region B ( t ) = { x ∈ M : t ( x ) ≤ t } . As before , the form of the expansion depends on the parity of n . For n odd , ( 2 . 15 ) volB ( t ) = v ( n ) t − n + v ( n − 2 ) t − ( n − 2 ) + · · · + V + o ( 1 ) , while for n even , ( 2 . 16 ) volB ( t ) = v ( n ) t − n + v ( n − 2 ) t − ( n − 2 ) + · · · + L log t + V + o ( 1 ) . The constant term V is called the renormalized volume . More importantly for our purposes , let I EH be the Einstein - Hilbert action , ( with Gibbons - Hawking - York boundary term ) , given by ( 2 . 17 ) I EH = Z M ( s − 2Λ ) dvol + 12 Z ∂M Hdv , where s is the scalar curvature , Λ is the cosmological constant and H is the mean curvature of the boundary . In the normalization ( 1 . 2 ) , Λ = − n ( n − 1 ) / 2 . Einstein metrics , with scalar curvature − n ( n + 1 ) , are critical points of I EH , among variations ﬁxing the boundary metric . ( This is of course not the case for the volume functional ) . The action I EH is inﬁnite on M , but since s is constant on Einstein metrics , ( i . e . on shell ) , the cut - oﬀ action has an expansion of the same form as ( 2 . 15 ) or ( 2 . 16 ) . Subtracting the divergent contributions as in ( 2 . 15 ) - ( 2 . 16 ) gives the renormalized action I renEH . On the space E AH , i . e . on shell , when n is odd one has I renEH = − 2 nV , as functionals on E AH ; the boundary term in ( 2 . 17 ) renormalizes to 0 . Similarly in this case , the renormalized action or volume is in fact independent of the deﬁning function t , so these functionals descend to functionals on the moduli space E AH . Neither of these facts hold however for n even . When dimM = 4 , it is proved in [ 5 ] that on E AH , I renEH and V are related to the square of the L 2 norm of the Weyl curvature W of ( M , g ) in the following simple way : ( 2 . 18 ) 1 8 π 2 Z M | W | 2 = χ ( M ) + 1 8 π 2 I renEH = χ ( M ) − 3 4 π 2 V . The relation ( 2 . 18 ) will play an important role in understanding the structure of the space E AH , in particular in § 3 and § 5 . It is proved in [ 5 ] , [ 18 ] , cf . also [ 33 ] , that as a 1 - form on E m , α AH the diﬀerential of the renormalized action is given by ( 2 . 19 ) d g I renEH ( h ) = c n Z ∂M h τ ( n ) , h ( 0 ) i dv , where τ ( n ) is as in ( 2 . 12 ) , the inner product and volume form are with respect to γ and c n is a constant depending only on n . The term h ( 0 ) is the variation of the boundary metric induced by h , i . e . h ( 0 ) = Π ∗ ( h ) . 7 For later purposes , we need a slight but important extension of ( 2 . 19 ) . Thus , given g ∈ E AH , deﬁne an enlarged “tangent” space e T g E AH roughly as follows : h ∈ e T g E AH if h ∈ S m , α ( M ) and h is an inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformation to order at least n at t = 0 , in the sense that the expansion ( 2 . 9 ) or ( 2 . 10 ) holds to order n in t , to 1 st order in the variation h . More precisely , consider the curve g u = g + uh and assume without loss of generality that the geodesic deﬁning function associated to g u is the ﬁxed function t ; ( this can always be achieved by modifying g u by a curve of diﬀeomorphisms in D 1 if necessary ) . Then ¯ g u has the expansion ( 2 . 20 ) ¯ g u = dt 2 + ( g ( 0 ) + uh ( 0 ) ) + t ( g ( 1 ) + uh ( 1 ) ) + t 2 ( g ( 2 ) + uh ( 2 ) ) + · · · + t n log t ( H g + uh ) + t n ( g ( n ) + uh ( n ) ) + O ( t n + α ) . Then h ∈ e T g E AH means that the coeﬃcients h ( i ) = ddu ( g ( i ) + uh ( i ) ) | u = 0 are the linearizations of the coeﬃcients g ( i ) and H in ( 2 . 9 ) - ( 2 . 10 ) in the direction h ( 0 ) , for i ≤ n . Similarly , the linearization of the trace condition in ( 2 . 11 ) should hold in the direction h ( 0 ) . Here we recall that the coeﬃcients g ( i ) , H and trg ( n ) are explicitly determined from the Einstein equations by the boundary metric γ = g ( 0 ) . Lemma 2 . 2 . For any boundary variation h ( 0 ) ∈ S 2 ( ∂M ) , there exists h ∈ e T g E AH such that h induces h ( 0 ) at ∂M , i . e . for Π as in ( 2 . 1 ) , Π ∗ : e T g E AH → S 2 ( ∂M ) is surjective . Moreover , at any g ∈ E AH , the equation ( 2 . 19 ) holds for any h ∈ e T g E AH . Proof : The ﬁrst statement follows immediately from the fact that the equations for the terms h ( i ) in the expansion of h can easily be solved algebraically . For example , the g ( 2 ) term is given explicitly by g ( 2 ) = 1 n − 2 ( Ric γ − s γ 2 ( n − 1 ) γ ) . The linearization of the right - hand side of this equation in the direction h ( 0 ) then deﬁnes the term h ( 2 ) . The same reasoning applies to all the other coeﬃcients , including the log coeﬃcient H , as well as the trace constraint ( 2 . 11 ) . Of course h ( i ) = 0 if i is odd , i < n . The second statement follows directly from the proof of ( 2 . 19 ) in [ 5 ] , to which we refer for some further details . First , it is easy to see that I renEH is well - deﬁned , and so ﬁnite , for any metric g u = t − 2 ¯ g u as in ( 2 . 20 ) which is Einstein to n th order at ∂M ; see also [ 5 , Remark 1 . 2 ] . Further , as noted above , Einstein metrics are critical points of I renEH , and so its variation in any direction depends only on the variation of the metric at the boundary . Thus , d I renEH depends only on the boundary terms g ( j ) in the Feﬀerman - Graham expansion ( 2 . 9 ) - ( 2 . 10 ) . Since it is exactly the form of these terms which leads to the formula ( 2 . 19 ) , and since this form is preserved for the metrics g u , ( to 1st order in u ) , it is essentially clear that ( 2 . 19 ) holds for h ∈ e T g E AH . Alternately , this may veriﬁed directly by an examination of the proof of ( 2 . 19 ) in [ 5 , Lemma 2 . 1 , Theorem 2 . 2 ] , with I EH in place of volume . The divergence constraint in ( 2 . 11 ) is not used in the computation of I renEH or its ﬁrst variation . ( It does arise however in the second variation ) . Let D g E AH ⊂ S m , α ( M ) be the subspace consisting of forms satisfying the linearized divergence constraint ( 2 . 11 ) at ∂M , so that ( 2 . 21 ) δ ′ ( τ ( n ) ) + δτ ′ ( n ) = 0 , where δ ′ = d du δ ( g ( 0 ) + uh ( 0 ) ) and τ ′ ( n ) = g ′ ( n ) + r ′ ( n ) = h ( n ) + s ( n ) , s ′ ( n ) = d du ( r ( n ) ) ( g ( 0 ) + uh ( 0 ) ) . Of course s ( n ) = 0 for n odd . The space F g E AH = D g E AH ∩ e T g E AH represents the space of formal solutions of the linearized Einstein equations near ∂M , in that any h ∈ F g E AH deﬁnes uniquely a formal series solution as in 8 ( 2 . 9 ) - ( 2 . 10 ) of the linearized Einstein equations . If h ( 0 ) and h ( n ) are real - analytic on ∂M , the result of Kichenassamy [ 28 ] mentioned above implies that the series converges to an actual linearized Einstein deformation h deﬁned near ∂M . Note that while the divergence and trace of h ( n ) are determined by h ( 0 ) , the transverse - traceless part of h ( n ) may be freely chosen . Proposition 2 . 3 . For g ∈ E AH , the map Π ∗ : D g E AH → S 2 ( ∂M ) , Π ∗ ( h ) = h ( 0 ) , is surjective . Proof : Given Lemma 2 . 2 , one needs to show that ( 2 . 21 ) is solvable , for any boundary variation h ( 0 ) , i . e . δ ′ ( τ ( n ) ) ∈ Imδ , for all variations h ( 0 ) of γ . The space of 1 - forms on ∂M has the splitting Ω 1 ( ∂M ) = Imδ ⊕ Kerδ ∗ , so that if Kerδ ∗ = 0 , i . e . ( ∂M , γ ) has no Killing ﬁelds , then the result is clear . When ( ∂M , γ ) does have Killing ﬁelds , this result is far from clear ; using Theorem 2 . 5 below , this result is proved in [ 8 ] , to which we refer for details . We will see later in § 4 , ( in and following ( 4 . 45 ) ) , that Π ∗ is surjective on the full formal space F g E AH . It is worth noting that the global boundary map Π ∗ : T g → S 2 ( ∂M ) is not surjective in general , cf . § 7 . Thus , the formal solutions of the linearized Einstein equations in F g E AH , even if they give rise to actual linearized solutions , do not extend in general to smooth solutions on the compact manifold M . On the other hand , Proposition 2 . 3 is false for AH Einstein metrics deﬁned only in a neighborhood or thickening of ∂M . The proof of Proposition 2 . 3 in [ 8 ] is global ; it requires that ( M , g ) is conformally compact , as does Theorem 2 . 5 below . The following result will play an important role in § 4 , cf . the proof of Proposition 4 . 6 . Proposition 2 . 4 . For g ∈ E AH and h ∈ F g E AH , let σ ( n ) = τ ′ ( n ) , for τ ′ ( n ) as in ( 2 . 21 ) . Similarly , let a ′ ( n ) be the variation of the conformal anomaly a ( n ) in the direction h . Then for any boundary metric ( ∂M , γ ) , γ ∈ [ γ ] = Π [ g ] , and smooth vector ﬁeld X on ∂M , one has ( 2 . 22 ) Z ∂M hL X τ ( n ) + [ ( 1 − 2 n ) divX ] τ ( n ) , h ( 0 ) i dV = Z ∂M h σ ( n ) + 12 trh ( 0 ) τ ( n ) , ˆ L X γ i dV + 1 n Z ∂M divX ( a ( n ) trh ( 0 ) + 2 a ′ ( n ) ) dV , where ˆ L X γ is the conformal Killing operator on ∂M , ˆ L X γ = L X γ − 2 divXn γ . The formula ( 2 . 22 ) holds for any variation h ( 0 ) of γ . Proof : This is a simple consequence of a result proved in [ 8 ] . Namely , from [ 8 , Prop . 5 . 4 ] , one has ( 2 . 23 ) Z ∂M hL X τ ( n ) , h ( 0 ) i = − 2 Z ∂M h δ ′ ( τ ( n ) ) , X i + Z ∂M δX h τ ( n ) , h ( 0 ) i + h τ ( n ) , δ ∗ X i trh ( 0 ) dV , where δ ′ = ddu δ γ + uh ( 0 ) . Using the deﬁnition of ˆ L X γ , this gives Z ∂M hL X τ ( n ) + divXτ ( n ) , h ( 0 ) i = − 2 Z ∂M h δ ′ ( τ ( n ) ) , X i + 12 Z ∂M h τ ( n ) , ˆ L X γ i trh ( 0 ) dV + 1 n Z ∂M a ( n ) divXtrh ( 0 ) dV . Next , by ( 2 . 21 ) and Proposition 2 . 3 , δ ′ τ ( n ) = − δσ ( n ) , for any variation h ( 0 ) of the boundary metric γ , so that − 2 Z ∂M h δ ′ τ ( n ) , X i = 2 Z ∂M h δσ ( n ) , X i = 2 Z ∂M h σ ( n ) , δ ∗ X i = Z ∂M h σ ( n ) , L X γ i . 9 Write L X γ = ˆ L X γ + 2 divXn γ . Then h σ ( n ) , γ i = trσ ( n ) = − tr ′ ( τ ( n ) ) + a ′ ( n ) = h τ ( n ) , h ( 0 ) i + a ′ ( n ) , where the middle equality follows from the linearization of ( 2 . 11 ) with h ∈ e T g E AH . Combining these computations gives ( 2 . 22 ) . Observe that the ﬁrst term on the right - hand side of ( 2 . 22 ) vanishes when X is a conformal Killing ﬁeld of ( ∂M , [ γ ] ) . Using ( 2 . 14 ) , it is easy to see that both sides of ( 2 . 22 ) are conformally invariant when n is odd ; on the other hand , both sides of ( 2 . 22 ) depend on the representative γ ∈ [ γ ] when n is even . Note also that ( 2 . 22 ) is invariant under the addition of transverse - traceless terms to σ ( n ) . The following result , also from [ 8 ] and used to prove Proposition 2 . 3 , will be frequently used in § 7 . Theorem 2 . 5 . Let g be an AH Einstein metric on an ( n + 1 ) - manifold M , with C ∞ boundary metric γ , ( in some compactiﬁcation ) . Then any connected Lie group of isometries of ( ∂M , γ ) extends to an action by isometries on ( M , g ) . Remark 2 . 6 . Finally , for the work in § 5 , we mention brieﬂy the class of toral AdS black hole metrics on M = R 2 × T n − 1 . These are AH Einstein metrics given explicitly by ( 2 . 24 ) g m = V − 1 dr 2 + V dθ 2 + r 2 g T n − 1 , where V ( r ) = r 2 − 2 m r n − 2 , θ ∈ [ 0 , 4 π / nr + ] , r + = ( 2 m ) 1 / n > 0 and g T n − 1 is any ﬂat metric on the torus T n − 1 , cf . [ 6 , Prop . 4 . 4 ] and references therein . The boundary metric of g m is a ﬂat ( product ) metric on the n - torus T n . Twisted versions of these metrics , obtained by taking suitable covering spaces and then passing to ( diﬀerent ) discrete quotients , give rise to inﬁnitely many isometrically distinct AH Einstein metrics g i on R 2 × T n − 1 with a ﬁxed ﬂat boundary metric T n − 1 . These metrics are also the examples discussed following the statement of Theorem A . It is worth noting that the metrics g m are all locally isometric . 3 . Compactness I : Interior Behavior . The purpose of the next two sections is to lay the groundwork for the proof of Theorem A ; this section deals with the interior behavior , while § 4 is concerned with the behavior near the boundary . The property that the boundary map Π is proper is a compactness issue . Thus , given a sequence of boundary metrics γ i converging to a limit metric γ , one needs to prove that a sequence of AH Einstein metrics ( M , g i ) with boundary metrics γ i has a subsequence converging , modulo diﬀeomorphisms , to a limit AH Einstein metric g on M , with boundary metric γ . In § 3 . 1 , we summarize background material on convergence and degeneration of sequences of metrics in general , as well as sequences of Einstein metrics . This section may be glanced over and then referred to as necessary . The following section § 3 . 2 then applies these results to the interior behavior of AH Einstein metrics . § 3 . 1 . In this section , we discuss L p Cheeger - Gromov theory as well as the convergence and degeneration results of Einstein metrics on 4 - manifolds from [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] . We begin with the L p Cheeger - Gromov theory . The L ∞ Cheeger - Gromov theory [ 15 ] , [ 22 ] , describes the ( moduli ) space of metrics on a manifold , ( or sequence of manifolds ) , with uniformly bounded curvature in L ∞ , i . e . ( 3 . 1 ) | R g | ( x ) ≤ Λ < ∞ , in that it describes the convergence or possible degenerations of sequences of metrics satisfying the bound ( 3 . 1 ) . The space L ∞ is not a good space on which to carry out analysis , and so we replace 10 ( 3 . 1 ) by a corresponding L p bound , i . e . ( 3 . 2 ) Z M | R g | p dV ≤ Λ < ∞ . The curvature involves 2 derivatives of the metric , and so ( 3 . 2 ) is analogous to an L 2 , p bound on the metric . The critical exponent p with respect to Sobolev embedding L 2 , p ⊂ C o is ( n + 1 ) / 2 , where n + 1 = dimM and hence we will always assume that ( 3 . 3 ) p > ( n + 1 ) / 2 . In order to obtain local results , we need the following deﬁnitions of local invariants of Riemannian metrics , cf . [ 4 ] . Deﬁnition 3 . 1 . If ( M , g ) is a Riemannian ( n + 1 ) - manifold , the L p curvature radius ρ ( x ) ≡ ρ p ( x ) at x is the radius of the largest geodesic ball B x ( ρ ( x ) ) such that , for all B y ( s ) ⊂ B x ( ρ ( x ) ) , with s ≤ dist ( y , ∂B x ( ρ ( x ) ) ) , one has ( 3 . 4 ) s 2 p volB y ( s ) Z B y ( s ) | R | p dV ≤ c 0 , where c 0 is a ﬁxed suﬃciently small constant . Although c 0 is an essentially free parameter , we will ﬁx c 0 = 10 − 2 throughout the paper . The left - side of ( 3 . 4 ) is a scale - invariant local average of the curvature in L p . The volume radius ν ( x ) of ( M , g ) at x is given by ( 3 . 5 ) ν ( x ) = sup { r : volB y ( s ) ω n + 1 s n + 1 ≥ µ 0 , ∀ B y ( s ) ⊂ B x ( r ) } , where ω n + 1 is the volume of the Euclidean unit ( n + 1 ) - ball and again µ 0 > 0 is a free small parameter , which will be ﬁxed in any given discussion , e . g . µ 0 = 10 − 2 . The L k , p harmonic radius r k , p h ( x ) is the largest radius such that on the geodesic ball B x ( r ) , r = r k , p h ( x ) , there is a harmonic coordinate chart in which the metric components satisfy ( 3 . 6 ) C − 1 δ ij ≤ g ij ≤ Cδ ij r kp − ( n + 1 ) Z B x ( r ) | ∂ k g ij | p dV g ≤ C , where C is a ﬁxed constant ; again C may be arbitrary , but will be ﬁxed to C = 2 , ( for example ) . Observe that ρ ( x ) , ν ( x ) and r h ( x ) scale as distances , i . e . if g ′ = λ 2 · g , for some constant λ , then ρ ′ ( x ) = λ · ρ ( x ) , ν ′ ( x ) = λ · ν ( x ) and r ′ h ( x ) = λ · r h ( x ) . By deﬁnition , ρ , ν and r h are Lipschitz functions with Lipschitz constant 1 ; in fact for y ∈ B x ( ρ ( x ) ) , it is immediate from the deﬁnition that ( 3 . 7 ) ρ ( y ) ≥ dist ( y , ∂B x ( ρ ( x ) ) ) , and similarly for ν , r h . One may deﬁne L k , p , ( or C k , β ) curvature radii ρ k , p in a manner completely analogous to ( 3 . 4 ) . For the L k , p radius , the curvature | R | term in ( 3 . 4 ) is replaced by P j ≤ k | ∇ j R | and the power of s is chosen to make the resulting expression scale invariant . Clearly ρ k , p ≥ ρ k ′ , p ′ , whenever k + p ≥ k ′ + p ′ . It is proved in [ 3 ] that the curvature radius and harmonic radius are essentially equivalent , given a lower bound on the volume radius . Thus ( 3 . 8 ) r 2 , p h ( x ) ≥ r 0 ρ p ( x ) , 11 where r 0 depends only on a lower bound ν 0 for ν ( x ) . The same statement holds for the radii r k + 2 , p h and ρ k , p . A sequence of Riemannian metrics ( Ω i , g i ) is said to converge in the L k , p topology to a limit L k , p metric g on Ω if there is an atlas A for Ω and diﬀeomorphisms F i : Ω → Ω i such that F ∗ i ( g i ) converges to g in the L k , p topology in local coordinates with respect to the atlas A . Thus , the local components ( F ∗ i ( g i ) ) αβ → g αβ in the usual L k , p Sobolev topology on functions on R n + 1 . Similar deﬁnitions hold for C m , α convergence , and convergence in the weak L k , p topology . Any bounded sequence in L k , p has a weakly convergent subsequence , and similarly any bounded sequence in C m , α has a convergent subsequence in the C m , α ′ topology , for any α ′ < α . By Sobolev embedding , L k , p ⊂ C m , α , for m + α < k − n + 1 p . In particular , in dimension 4 , for p ∈ ( 2 , 4 ) , L 2 , p ⊂ C α , α = 2 − 4 p , and for p > 4 , L 2 , p ⊂ C 1 , α , for α = 1 − 4 p . One then has the following result on the convergence and degeneration of metrics with bounds on ρ , cf . [ 4 ] . Theorem 3 . 2 . Let ( Ω i , g i , x i ) be a pointed sequence of connected Riemannian ( n + 1 ) - manifolds and suppose there are constants ρ o > 0 , d o > 0 and D < ∞ such that , for a ﬁxed p > ( n + 1 ) / 2 , ( 3 . 9 ) ρ p ( y ) ≥ ρ o , diam Ω i ≤ D , dist ( x i , ∂ Ω i ) ≥ d o . Then for any 0 < ǫ < d o , there are domains U i ⊂ Ω i , with ǫ / 2 ≤ dist ( ∂U i , ∂ Ω i ) ≤ ǫ , for which one of the following alternatives holds . ( I ) . ( Convergence ) If there is constant ν o > 0 such that , ν i ( x i ) ≥ ν o > 0 , then a subsequence of { ( U i , g i , x i ) } converges , in the weak L 2 , p topology , to a limit L 2 , p Riemannian manifold ( U , g , x ) , x = lim x i . In particular , U i is diﬀeomorphic to U , for i suﬃciently large . ( II ) . ( Collapse ) If instead , ν ( x i ) → 0 , then U i has an F - structure in the sense of Cheeger - Gromov , cf . [ 15 ] . The metrics g i are collaps - ing everywhere in U i , i . e . ν i ( y i ) → 0 for all y i ∈ U i , and so in particular the injectivity radius inj g i ( y i ) → 0 . Any limit of { g i } in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology [ 22 ] is a lower dimensional length space . Remark 3 . 3 . ( i ) . The local hypothesis on ρ p in ( 3 . 9 ) can be replaced by the global hypothesis ( 3 . 10 ) Z Ω i | R | p dV ≤ Λ , in case the volume radius satisﬁes ν i ( y i ) ≥ ν o , for some ν o > 0 and all y i ∈ Ω i ; in fact under this condition ( 3 . 9 ) and ( 3 . 10 ) are then equivalent , with Λ = Λ ( ρ o , D , ν o ) . ( ii ) . It is an easy consequence of the deﬁnitions that the L p curvature radius ρ p is continuous under convergence in the ( strong ) L 2 , p topology , i . e . if g i → g in the L 2 , p topology , then ( 3 . 11 ) ρ i ( x i ) → ρ ( x ) , whenever x i → x , cf . [ 4 ] and references therein . However , ( 3 . 11 ) does not hold if the convergence is only in the weak L 2 , p topology . If in addition to a bound on ρ p one has L p bounds the covariant derivatives of the Ricci curva - ture up to order k , then in Case ( I ) one obtains convergence to the limit in the L k + 2 , p topology . Analogous statements hold for convergence in the C m , α ′ topology . 12 Next we discuss the convergence and degeneration of Einstein metrics . If M is a closed 4 - manifold and g an Einstein metric on M , then the Chern - Gauss - Bonnet theorem gives ( 3 . 12 ) 1 8 π 2 Z M | R | 2 dV = χ ( M ) , where χ ( M ) is the Euler characteristic of M . This gives apriori control on the L 2 norm of the curvature of Einstein metrics on M . However the L 2 norm is critical in dimension 4 with respect to Sobolev embedding , cf . ( 3 . 3 ) and so one may not expect Theorem 3 . 2 to hold for sequences of Einstein metrics on M . In fact , there is a further possible behavior of such sequences . Deﬁnition 3 . 4 . An Einstein orbifold ( X , g ) is a 4 - dimensional orbifold with a ﬁnite number of cone singularities { q j } , j = 1 , . . . , k . On X o = X \ ∪ { q j } , g is a smooth Einstein metric while each singular point q ∈ { q j } has a neighborhood U such that U \ q is diﬀeomorphic to C ( S 3 / Γ ) \ { 0 } , where Γ is a ﬁnite subgroup of O ( 4 ) and C denotes the cone with vertex { 0 } . Further Γ 6 = { e } and when lifted to the universal cover B 4 \ { 0 } of C ( S 3 / Γ ) \ { 0 } , the metric g extends smoothly over { 0 } to a smooth Einstein metric on the 4 - ball B 4 . There are numerous examples of sequences of smooth Einstein metrics g i on a compact manifold M which converge , in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology , to an Einstein orbifold limit ( X , g ) . Such orbifold metrics are not smooth metrics on the manifold M , but may be viewed as singular metrics on M , in that M is a resolution of X . We then have the following result describing the convergence and degeneration of Einstein metrics on 4 - manifolds , cf . [ 3 ] . Theorem 3 . 5 . Let ( Ω i , g i , x i ) be a pointed sequence of connected Einstein 4 - manifolds satisfying ( 3 . 13 ) diam Ω i ≤ D , dist ( x i , ∂ Ω i ) ≥ d o , and ( 3 . 14 ) Z Ω i | R g i | 2 dV g i ≤ Λ o , for some constants d o > 0 , D , Λ o < ∞ . Then for any 0 < ǫ < d o , there are domains U i ⊂ Ω i , with ǫ / 2 ≤ dist ( ∂U i , ∂ Ω i ) ≤ ǫ , for which exactly one of the following alternatives holds . ( I ) . ( Convergence ) . A subsequence of ( U i , g i , x i ) converges in the C ∞ topology to a limit smooth Einstein metric ( U , g , x ) , x = lim x i . ( II ) . ( Orbifolds ) . A subsequence of ( U i , g i , x i ) converges to an Einstein orbifold metric ( X , g , x ) in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology . Away from the singular variety , the convergence g i → g is C ∞ , while the curvature of g i blows up in L ∞ at the singular variety . ( III ) . ( Collapse ) . A subsequence of ( U i , g i , x i ) collapses , in that ν ( y i ) → 0 for all y i ∈ U i . The collapse is with “generalized” bounded curvature , in that inj 2 g i ( x ) | R | g i ( x ) → 0 , metrically away from a ﬁnite number of singular points ; however such singularities might be more complicated than orbifold cone singularities . The cases ( I ) and ( II ) occur if and only if ( 3 . 15 ) ν i ( x i ) ≥ ν o , for some ν o > 0 , while ( III ) occurs if ( 3 . 15 ) fails . One obtains C ∞ convergence in ( I ) , and ( II ) away from the singularities , since Einstein metrics satisfy an elliptic system of PDE , ( in harmonic coordinates ) . When Ω i is a closed 4 - manifold M , the bound ( 3 . 14 ) follows immediately from ( 3 . 12 ) . When ( Ω i , g i ) are complete AHE metrics on a ﬁxed 4 - manifold M , then of course ( 3 . 14 ) does not hold 13 with Ω i = M . However , in the normalization ( 1 . 2 ) , one has | W | 2 = | R | 2 − 6 where W is the Weyl tensor of ( M , g ) and so by ( 2 . 18 ) ( 3 . 16 ) 1 8 π 2 Z M ( | R g | 2 − 6 ) dV g = χ ( M ) − 3 4 π 2 V . Thus , a lower bound on the renormalized volume V ( or upper bound on the renormalized action ) and an upper bound on χ ( M ) give a global bound on the L 2 norm of W . In particular , under these bounds ( 3 . 14 ) holds for Ω i a geodesic ball B x i ( R ) of any ﬁxed radius R about the base point x i ∈ ( M , g i ) . We point out that Theorem 3 . 5 is special to dimension 4 . A similar result holds in higher dimensions only if one has a uniform bound on the L n / 2 norm of curvature in place of ( 3 . 14 ) ; however there is no analogue of ( 3 . 16 ) for ( general ) Einstein metrics in higher dimensions . Remark 3 . 6 . Theorems 3 . 2 and 3 . 5 are local results . However , we will often apply them globally , to sequences of complete manifolds , and with complete limits . This is done by a standard procedure as follows , in the situation of Theorem 3 . 2 for example . Suppose { g i } is a sequence of complete metrics on a manifold M , or on a sequence of manifolds M i , with base points x i , and satisfying ρ ( y i ) ≥ ρ o , for all y i ∈ ( M , g i ) . One may then apply Theorem 3 . 2 to the domains ( B x i ( R ) , g i , x i ) , where B x i ( R ) is the geodesic R - ball about x i to obtain a limit manifold ( U ( R ) , g ∞ , x ∞ ) , in the non - collapse case . Now take a divergent sequence R j → ∞ and carry out this process for each j . There is then a diagonal subsequence B x i ( R i ) of B x i ( R j ) which converges to a complete limit ( N , g ∞ , x ∞ ) . Similar arguments apply in the case of collapse and the cases of Theorem 3 . 5 . The convergence in these situations is also convergence in the pointed Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topol - ogy , [ 22 ] . § 3 . 2 . In this section , we study the behavior of sequences of AH Einstein metrics in the interior , i . e . away from ∂M . We ﬁrst discuss the hypotheses , and then state and prove the main result , Theorem 3 . 7 . Essentially for the rest of the paper , we will assume the topological condition on M = M 4 that ( 3 . 17 ) H 2 ( ∂M , F ) → H 2 ( ¯ M , F ) → 0 , where the map is induced by inclusion ι : ∂M → ¯ M and F is any ﬁeld . As will be seen , this serves to rule out any orbifold degenerations of AH Einstein sequences . While many of the results of this paper carry over to the orbifold setting , we prefer for simplicity to exclude this possibility here . Next , let g i ∈ E AH be a sequence of AH Einstein metrics on M with C m , α boundary metrics γ i , m ≥ 3 . As noted in § 2 , the geodesic compactiﬁcation ¯ g i of g i with boundary metric γ i is at least a C m − 1 , α compactiﬁcation . We assume the boundary behavior of { g i } is controlled , in that ( 3 . 18 ) γ i → γ , in the C m , α ′ topology on ∂M , for some α ′ ≤ α . Next assume that the inradius of ( M , ¯ g i ) has a uniform lower bound , i . e . ( 3 . 19 ) In ¯ g i ( ∂M ) = dist ¯ g i ( ¯ C i , ∂M ) ≥ ¯ τ , for some constant 0 < ¯ τ ≤ 1 , where ¯ C i is the cutlocus of ∂M in ( ¯ M , ¯ g i ) , and also assume an upper diameter bound ( 3 . 20 ) diam ¯ g i S ( t 1 ) ≤ T , where t 1 = ¯ τ / 2 and S ( t 1 ) = { x ∈ ( M , ¯ g i ) : t i ( x ) = t 1 } is the t 1 - level set of the geodesic deﬁning function t i for ( g i , γ i ) . 14 Finally , we assume that the Weyl curvature of g i is uniformly bounded in L 2 , i . e . ( 3 . 21 ) Z M | W g i | 2 dV g i ≤ Λ 0 < ∞ . All of these assumptions will be removed in § 4 and at the beginning of § 5 . The main result of this subsection is the following : Theorem 3 . 7 . Let { g i } be a sequence of metrics in E AH on M , satisfying ( 3 . 17 ) - ( 3 . 21 ) and let x i be a base point of ( M , g i ) satisfying ( 3 . 22 ) d ≤ dist ¯ g i ( x i , ∂M ) ≤ D , for some constants d > 0 and D < ∞ , where ¯ g i is the geodesic compactiﬁcation associated to γ i . Then a subsequence of ( M , g i , x i ) , converges to a complete Einstein metric ( N , g , x ∞ ) , x ∞ = lim x i . The convergence is in the C ∞ topology , uniformly on compact subsets , and the manifold N weakly embeds in M , ( 3 . 23 ) N ⊂⊂ M , in the sense that smooth bounded domains in N embed as such in M . Proof : By Theorem 3 . 5 and the discussion following ( 3 . 16 ) , together with Remark 3 . 6 , a subse - quence of { ( M , g i ) } based at x i either , ( i ) : converges smoothly to a complete limit Einstein manifold ( N , g , x ∞ ) , ( ii ) : converges to an Einstein orbifold , smoothly away from the singular variety , or ( iii ) : collapses uniformly on domains of arbitrary bounded diameter about { x i } . The ﬁrst ( and most important ) task is to rule out the possibility of collapse . To do this , we ﬁrst prove a useful volume monotonicity formula in the Lemma below ; this result will also be important in § 4 and holds in all dimensions . Let ( M , g ) be any AH Einstein manifold of dimension n + 1 , with C 2 , α geodesic compactiﬁcation ( 3 . 24 ) ¯ g = t 2 g and boundary metric γ . Let ¯ E be the inward normal exponential map of ( M , ¯ g ) at ∂M , so that σ x ( t ) = ¯ E ( x , t ) is a geodesic in t , for each ﬁxed x ∈ ∂M . As discussed in § 2 , for r = − log t , the curve σ x ( r ) is a geodesic in the Einstein manifold ( M , g ) . Let ¯ J ( x , t ) be the Jacobian of ¯ E ( x , t ) , so that ¯ J ( x , t ) = d ¯ V ( x , t ) / d ¯ V ( x , 0 ) , where d ¯ V is the volume form of the ’geodesic sphere’ S ( t ) , i . e . the t - level set of t as following ( 3 . 20 ) . Also , let τ 0 = τ 0 ( x ) be the distance to the cutlocus of ¯ E at x ∈ ∂M . Lemma 3 . 8 . In the notation above , the function ( 3 . 25 ) ¯ J ( x , t ) τ n 0 ( 1 − ( t τ 0 ) 2 ) n is monotone non - decreasing in t , for any ﬁxed x . Proof : As above , let r = log ( 1 t ) and , for any ﬁxed x , set r 0 = r 0 ( x ) = log ( 1 τ 0 ) . Then the curve σ x ( r ) is a geodesic in ( M , g ) and S ( r ) is the r - rlevel set of the distance function r . Let J ( x , r ) be the corresponding Jacobian for S ( r ) along σ x ( r ) , so that J ( x , r ) = t − n ¯ J ( x , t ) by ( 3 . 24 ) . Since Ric g = − ng , the inﬁnitesimal form of the Bishop - Gromov volume comparison theorem [ 22 ] implies the ratio J ( x , r ) sinh n ( r − r 0 ) ↓ i . e . the ratio is monotone non - increasing in r , as r → ∞ . Converting this back to ( M , ¯ g ) , it follows that , in t , t − n ¯ J ( x , t ) t n sinh n ( log ( τ 0 t ) ) ↑ , 15 is increasing , since as r increases to ∞ , t decreases to 0 . But sinh n ( log ( τ 0 t ) ) = 12 n ( τ 0 t ) n ( 1 − ( tτ 0 ) 2 ) n , which gives ( 3 . 25 ) . Let q be any point in ∂M and consider the metric s - ball B x ( s ) = { y ∈ ¯ M : dist ¯ g ( y , q ) ≤ s } in ( ¯ M , ¯ g ) . Let D q ( s ) = B q ( s ) ∩ ∂M , so that D q ( s ) is the metric s - ball in ( ∂M , γ ) , since ∂M is totally geodesic . Observe that there are constants µ 0 > 0 and µ 1 < ∞ , which depend only on the C 0 geometry of the boundary metric γ , such that ( 3 . 26 ) µ 0 ≤ vol γ ( D q ( s ) ) s n ≤ µ 1 . Let D q ( s , t ) = { x ∈ M : x = ¯ E ( y , t ) , for some y ∈ D q ( s ) } , so that D q ( s , t ) ⊂ S ( t ) . It follows immediately from ( 3 . 25 ) by integration over ( a domain in ) ∂M that , for any ﬁxed s , ( 3 . 27 ) vol ¯ g D ( s , t ) ( s ¯ τ ) n ( 1 − ( t ¯ τ ) 2 ) n ↑ , and vol ¯ g S ( t ) ¯ τ n ( 1 − ( t ¯ τ ) 2 ) n ↑ , for ¯ τ as in ( 3 . 19 ) . Now let t 1 = ¯ τ / 2 , so that ( 3 . 27 ) implies in particular that ( 3 . 28 ) vol ¯ g S ( t 1 ) ≥ ( 3 4 ) n vol γ ∂M , and hence , with respect to ( M , g ) , ( 3 . 29 ) vol g S ( t 1 ) ≥ ( 3 4 ) n t − n 1 vol γ ∂M . This leads easily to the following lower bound on volumes of balls . Corollary 3 . 9 . Let ( M , g ) be an AH Einstein metric , satisfying ( 3 . 19 ) - ( 3 . 20 ) , and choose a point x satisfying ( 3 . 22 ) , i . e . d ≤ dist ¯ g ( x , ∂M ) ≤ D . Then ( 3 . 30 ) vol g B x ( 1 ) ≥ ν 0 > 0 , where ν 0 depends only on d , D , ¯ τ , T and the C 0 geometry of the boundary metric γ . Proof : Again , by the Bishop - Gromov volume comparison theorem on ( M , g ) , one has for any R ≥ r , ( 3 . 31 ) volB x ( r ) sinh n ( r ) ≥ volB x ( R ) sinh n ( R ) . Suppose r ( x ) = D 1 , so that D 1 ∈ [ − log D , − log d ] . Then for any y ∈ S ( t 1 ) , the triangle inequality and ( 3 . 20 ) imply that dist g ( x , y ) ≤ | D 1 | + t − 1 1 · T ≡ D 2 . Hence , choose R so that R = D 2 + 1 , which implies that S ( t 1 ) ⊂ B x ( R − 1 ) . But volB x ( R ) ≥ volA ( R − 2 , R ) ≥ 12 volS ( t 1 ) , where the second inequality follows from the coarea formula , ( changing t 1 slightly if necessary ) . Combining this with the comparison estimate above implies volB x ( 1 ) ≥ c 2 volS ( t 1 ) sinh − n ( D 2 ) ≥ c 3 t − n 1 sinh − n ( D 2 ) vol γ ∂M , where the last inequality follows from ( 3 . 29 ) . This gives ( 3 . 30 ) . Corollary 3 . 9 gives a uniform lower bound on the volume radius of each g i at x i satisfying ( 3 . 22 ) and so there is no possibility of collapse . Theorem 3 . 5 and Remark 3 . 6 then imply that ( M , g i , x i ) has a subsequence converging in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology either to a complete Einstein manifold ( N , g , x ∞ ) or to a complete Einstein orbifold ( V , g , x ∞ ) . Next , we use the hypothesis ( 3 . 17 ) to rule out orbifold limits . Thus , suppose the second al - ternative above holds , so that ( M , g i ) converges in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology to a complete Einstein orbifold ( X , g ) . With each orbifold singularity q ∈ X with neighborhood of the form C ( S 3 / Γ ) , there is associated a ( preferred ) smooth complete Ricci - ﬂat 4 - manifold ( E , g 0 ) , which 16 is asymptotically locally Euclidean ( ALE ) , in that ( E , g ) is asymptotic to a ﬂat cone C ( S 3 / Γ E ) , Γ E 6 = { e } , cf . [ 1 , § 5 ] , [ 3 , § 3 ] . The complete manifold ( E , g o ) is obtained as a limit of blow - ups or rescalings of the metrics g i restricted to small balls B y i ( δ i ) at the maximal curvature scale ; thus one does not necessarily have Γ = Γ E , since there may be other Ricci - ﬂat ALE orbifolds arising from blow - ups at other curvature scales . In any case , the manifold E is embedded in the ambient manifold M ; in fact for any δ > 0 and points y i → q , E is topologically embedded in ( B y i ( δ ) , g i ) . The Einstein metrics g i crush the topology of E to a point in that E ⊂ ( B y i ( δ ) , g i ) and B y i ( δ ) converges to the cone C ( S 3 / Γ ) , in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology for any ﬁxed δ > 0 suﬃciently small . Next we point out that any such ALE space E has non - trivial topology . This result corrects a minor inaccuracy in [ 1 , Lemma 6 . 3 ] . Proposition 3 . 10 . Let ( E , g 0 ) be a complete , non - ﬂat , oriented Ricci - ﬂat ALE manifold . Then ( 3 . 32 ) H 2 ( E , F ) 6 = 0 , for some ﬁeld F . Moreover , if E is simply connected , then H 2 ( E , Z ) is torsion - free , so that H 2 ( E , R ) 6 = 0 , while H 2 ( E , F ) = 0 , for any ﬁnite ﬁeld F . Proof : It is well - known that | π 1 ( E ) | < ∞ , so that b 1 ( E ) = 0 , and also b 3 ( E ) = 0 , ( cf . [ 1 ] for example ) . Hence χ ( E ) = 1 + b 2 ( E ) ≥ 1 . If b 2 ( E ) > 0 , then of course ( 3 . 32 ) follows , so suppose b 2 ( E ) = 0 , so that χ ( E ) = 1 . The Euler characteristic may be computed with respect to homology with coeﬃcients in any ﬁeld F , so that χ ( E ) = 1 − H 1 ( E , F ) + H 2 ( E , F ) = 1 , since again H 3 ( E , F ) = H 4 ( E , F ) = 0 . Now if ( 3 . 32 ) does not hold , then it follows that H 1 ( E , F ) = 0 , for all F . By the universal coeﬃcient theorem , this implies H 1 ( E , Z ) = H 2 ( E , Z ) = 0 . Thus , E is an integral homology ball , with ﬁnite π 1 . It then follows by the arguments in [ 1 , Lemma 6 . 3 ] that E is ﬂat , giving a contradiction . This proves ( 3 . 32 ) . The proof of the second statement is an immediate consequence of the universal coeﬃcient theorem . Next , observe that there is an injection ( 3 . 33 ) 0 → H 2 ( E , F ) → H 2 ( M , F ) . To see this , the Mayer - Vietoris sequence for ( a thickening of ) the pair ( E , M \ E ) gives H 2 ( S 3 / Γ , F ) → H 2 ( E , F ) ⊕ H 2 ( M \ E , F ) → H 2 ( M , F ) . Thus , it suﬃces to show that i ∗ : H 2 ( S 3 / Γ , F ) → H 2 ( E , F ) is the zero - map . If E is simply connected , this follows immediately from Proposition 3 . 10 , since H 2 ( S 3 / Γ , Z ) is torsion , while H 2 ( E , Z ) is torsion - free . In general , let e E be the universal cover of E , so that the covering map π : e E → E is ﬁnite - to - one . One has ∂ e E = S 3 / e Γ , for some ﬁnite group e Γ . Now any 2 - cycle in S 3 / Γ with coeﬃcients in F may be represented by a map , ( or more precisely a collection of maps ) , f : S 2 → S 3 / Γ . This lifts to a map e f : S 2 → S 3 / e Γ = ∂ e E . As noted above , the 2 - cycle e f bounds a 3 - chain F in e E . Composing with the projection map π , it follows that f bounds a 3 - chain in E , which proves the claim . Now returning to ( 3 . 17 ) and orbifold limits , let Σ be any non - zero 2 - cycle in H 2 ( E , F ) ; ( Σ exists by ( 3 . 32 ) ) . By ( 3 . 17 ) , there is a 2 - cycle Σ ∞ in H 2 ( ∂M , F ) homologous to Σ , so that there is a 3 - chain W in M such that ∂W = Σ − Σ ∞ . But Z = W ∩ ( S 3 / Γ ) 6 = ∅ and so Z represents a 2 - cycle in H 2 ( S 3 / Γ , F ) . By the preceding argument , Z bounds a 3 - chain W ′ in E . Hence ( W ∩ E ) + W ′ is a 3 - chain in E , with boundary Σ , i . e . [ Σ ] = 0 in H 2 ( E , F ) , giving a contradiction . 17 Thus , the hypothesis ( 3 . 17 ) rules out any possible orbifold degeneration of the sequence ( M , g i ) . Having ruled out the possibilities ( ii ) and ( iii ) , it follows that ( i ) must hold . The fact that N is weakly embedded in M follows immediately from Remark 3 . 6 and the deﬁnition of smooth convergence preceding ( 3 . 8 ) . This completes the proof of Theorem 3 . 7 . Remark 3 . 11 . ( i ) . Note that Theorem 3 . 7 does not imply that the limit manifold N topologically equals M . For instance , it is possible at this stage that some of the topology of M escapes to inﬁnity , and is lost in the limit N . All of the results and discussion in § 3 . 2 hold without change if the 4 - manifold M is replaced by a sequence of 4 - manifolds M i , with a common boundary ∂M i = ∂M , so that one has ( M i , g i ) in place of ( M , g i ) . ( ii ) . We also observe that the proof shows that there is a uniform bound Λ = Λ ( Λ 0 , d , D , T , { γ i } ) < ∞ such that , for x satisfying ( 3 . 22 ) , ( 3 . 34 ) | R g i | ( x ) ≤ Λ , i . e . there is a uniform bound on the sectional curvatures of { g i } in this region . ( iii ) . The existence and behavior of ( M , g i ) at base points x i where dist ¯ g i ( x i , ∂M ) → ∞ will be discussed at the end of § 4 . 4 . Compactness II : Boundary Behavior . Theorem 3 . 7 essentially corresponds to a uniform interior regularity result in that one has uniform control of the AHE metrics g i in the interior of the 4 - manifold M , i . e . on compact subsets of M . In this subsection , we extend this to similar control in a neighborhood of deﬁnite size about the boundary . The Chern - Gauss - Bonnet theorem in ( 3 . 12 ) , cf . also ( 3 . 21 ) , plays a crucial role in obtaining control in the interior . A signiﬁcant point in this section is to prove that such an apriori L 2 bound on the curvature is not necessary to obtain control near the boundary ; thus we show that control of the boundary metric itself gives control of the Einstein metric in a neighborhood of the boundary of deﬁnite size , cf . Corollary 4 . 10 . Much of the proof of this result holds in fact in all even dimensions and conjecturally in all dimensions . We begin with the following result , most of which was proved in [ 6 ] , cf . also [ 7 ] . We ﬁx p > 4 and denote the L p curvature radius by ρ instead of ρ p . Proposition 4 . 1 . On a ﬁxed 4 - manifold M , let g ∈ E m , α AH , m ≥ 4 , with boundary metric γ satisfying | | γ | | C m , α ≤ K in a ﬁxed coordinate atlas for ∂M . Let U δ = { x ∈ ¯ M : dist ¯ g ( x , ∂M ) ≤ δ } where ¯ g is the geodesic compactiﬁcation of ( M , g ) with boundary metric γ . Suppose the L p curvature radius of ¯ g satisﬁes ( 4 . 1 ) ρ ( x ) ≥ ρ 0 , for some constant ρ 0 > 0 , for all x ∈ U δ 0 , some δ 0 > 0 . Then there is a δ 1 = δ 1 ( ρ 0 , δ 0 , K ) > 0 such that the C m − 1 , α geometry of the geodesic compactiﬁ - cation ¯ g is uniformly controlled in U δ 1 , in that ( 4 . 2 ) r m − 1 , α h ≥ r 0 , where r 0 depends only on ρ 0 , δ 0 , and K . The same statement holds if m = ∞ or m = ω . Proof : By the discussion in § 2 , boundary regularity implies that ( M , g ) has a C m , α conformal compactiﬁcation e g , with boundary metric γ . The metric e g may be chosen to be of constant scalar curvature e s = const and e g is C m , α in local harmonic coordinates . Again as noted in § 2 , the geodesic compactiﬁcation ¯ g of g with boundary metric γ is then at least C m − 1 , α . Moreover , by [ 6 , Prop . 2 . 1 , Thm . 2 . 4 and Prop . 2 . 7 ] , the C m − 1 , α geometry of the metric ¯ g is uniformly controlled in U δ 1 , i . e . ( 4 . 2 ) holds , for δ 1 = δ 1 ( ρ o , γ ) , provided the C m , α geometry of the boundary metric γ is 18 uniformly bounded , ( 4 . 1 ) holds , and provided there is a uniform lower bound on the volume radius of ¯ g in U δ 1 . The control on the boundary metric and ( 4 . 1 ) are given by hypothesis . To obtain a lower bound on the volume radius ν , observe that Lemma 3 . 8 , cf . also ( 3 . 27 ) , gives a lower bound on the volume ratios of balls , volB q ( s ) / s 4 centered at points q ∈ ∂M , depending only on the C 0 geometry of the boundary metric . In particular , there is a constant ν 0 > 0 such that volB q ( ρ 0 ) / ρ 40 ≥ ν 0 , q ∈ ∂M , for all ( M , ¯ g i ) . Within the L p curvature radius , i . e . for balls B x ( r ) ⊂ B q ( ρ 0 ) , standard volume comparison results imply then a lower bound volB x ( r ) / r 4 ≥ ν 1 , where ν 1 depends only on ν 0 , cf . [ 4 , § 3 ] . This gives a uniform lower bound on the volume radius within U ρ 0 , and hence the result follows . Proposition 4 . 1 also holds locally , in that if ( 4 . 1 ) holds at all points in an open set V containing a domain of ﬁxed size in ∂M , then the conclusion holds in V ∩ U δ 1 . Also , this result holds for m ≥ 3 . Of course the arguments concerning the lower bound on the volume radius hold in all dimensions . Proposition 4 . 1 should be understood as a natural strengthening of the boundary regularity prop - erty that AH Einstein metrics with C m , α boundary metric have a C m , α conformal compactiﬁcation . Thus , it gives uniform control or stability of the metric g ∈ E m , α AH near the boundary , depending only on the boundary metric and a lower bound on ρ as in ( 4 . 1 ) . The main result of this section , Theorem 4 . 4 below , removes the assumption ( 4 . 1 ) and proves the estimate ( 4 . 2 ) independent of ρ 0 and δ 0 . Of course this could not be true locally ; Theorem 4 . 4 is necessarily a global result . The weak hypothesis ( 4 . 1 ) on the curvature radius may obviously be replaced by a stronger assumption . Thus , Proposition 4 . 1 implies , for instance , that in the geodesic compactiﬁcation , ( 4 . 3 ) r k , β h ≥ r 0 ⇒ r m − 1 , α h ≥ r 1 , for any 2 < k + β < m − 1 + α with r 1 = r 1 ( r 0 , δ 0 , K ) . Thus , control of the metric in a weak norm , such as L k , p or C k , β implies control of the metric in a stronger norm , governed by the regularity of the metric at the boundary . We formalize this as follows : Deﬁnition 4 . 2 . In any dimension , an AH Einstein metric g ∈ E AH satisﬁes the strong control property if ( 4 . 3 ) holds , for some ( k , β ) and ( m , α ) with k + β < m − 1 + α , and m − 1 ≥ n . The proof of boundary regularity in [ 6 ] , ( cf . also [ 7 ] ) , uses the fact that AH Einstein metrics and their conformal compactiﬁcations satisfy the conformally invariant Bach equation in dimension 4 . In a suitable gauge , this is a non - linear elliptic system of PDE and boundary regularity follows essentially from standard boundary regularity for such elliptic systems . The strong control property ( 4 . 3 ) , ( or its original version in Proposition 4 . 1 ) , then follows from the fact that concurrent with boundary regularity , one has uniform elliptic estimates for solutions of the Bach equations near and up to the boundary , given weak control in such a region . Remark 4 . 3 . It will be noted in the proofs of the results below that all of the results of this section hold in all dimensions in which the strong control property holds . A recent result of Helliwell [ 25 ] proves boundary regularity for AH Einstein metrics in all even dimensions , by generalizing the proof in dimension 4 in [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . The idea is to use the Feﬀerman - Graham obstruction tensor in place of the Bach equations in higher dimensions ; again in a suitable gauge , this gives a non - linear elliptic system . The proof given in [ 25 ] requires that g be C n , α conformally compact , although we suspect that it suﬃces for g to be C 2 , α conformally compact . In any case , it is straightforward to show from [ 25 ] that the strong control property ( 4 . 3 ) holds in all even dimensions with n < k + β < m − 1 + α . In odd dimensions , conformal compactiﬁcations of AH Einstein metrics are not C n up to the boundary , exactly due to the presence of the obstruction tensor H . Nevertheless , one can deﬁne the spaces C m , α , m ≥ n in a polyhomogeneous sense . We conjecture that with such a suitable 19 modiﬁcation of the deﬁnition of harmonic radius , the strong control property holds in all odd dimensions ; this is an interesting open question . The main result of this section is the following : Theorem 4 . 4 . Let ( M , g ) be an AH Einstein metric on a 4 - manifold with a L 2 , p conformal com - pactiﬁcation , p > 4 , and boundary metric γ . Suppose that γ ∈ C m , α , m ≥ 4 and that , in a ﬁxed coordinate system for ∂M , | | γ | | C m , α ≤ K , for some α > 0 . If ¯ g is the associated C m − 1 , α geodesic compactiﬁcation of g determined by γ , then there are constants µ 0 > 0 and ρ 0 > 0 , depending only on K , α , and p , such that ( 4 . 4 ) ρ ( x ) ≥ ρ 0 , for all x with t ( x ) ≤ µ 0 . The same result holds in all dimensions in which the strong control property holds , with m ≥ n + 1 . The proof is rather long , and so is broken into several Propositions and Lemmas . Before be - ginning , it is worth pointing out that the curvature of ¯ g at ∂M is uniformly bounded by the C 2 geometry of the boundary metric γ , cf . ( A . 8 ) - ( A . 10 ) in the Appendix . Thus , the geometry of g at ∂M is well - controlled to 2 nd order ; one needs to extend this to control of g near ∂M . We will give the proof in all dimensions , assuming the strong control property holds . Also , we work with the L p curvature radius ρ = ρ p , p > n , but one may work equally well with the L k − 2 , q curvature or L k , q harmonic radius ; the arguments are exactly the same for these radii . Let τ 0 be the distance to the cutlocus of the normal exponential map from ∂M ; τ 0 ( x ) = dist ¯ g ( x , ¯ C ) , where ¯ C is the cutlocus , as in ( 3 . 19 ) . The ﬁrst step is to prove that the function ρ is bounded below by τ 0 near ∂M . The second , more diﬃcult , step is to prove that τ 0 itself is uniformly bounded below near ∂M . We begin with the following result . Proposition 4 . 5 . For ( M , g ) as in Theorem 4 . 4 , there is a constant c 0 > 0 , depending only on K , α and p , such that ( 4 . 5 ) ρ ( x ) ≥ c 0 τ 0 ( x ) , for all x with t ( x ) ≤ 1 . Proof : The proof is by contradiction . If ( 4 . 5 ) is false , then there must exist a sequence of AH Einstein metrics g i on M i , with C n , α ( polyhomogeneous ) geodesic compactiﬁcations ¯ g i , for which the boundary metrics γ i satisfy ( 4 . 6 ) | | γ i | | C n , α ≤ K , but for which the L p curvature radius ρ = ρ i of ¯ g i satisﬁes ( 4 . 7 ) ρ ( x i ) / τ 0 ( x i ) → 0 as i → ∞ , on some sequence of points x i ∈ ( ¯ M i , ¯ g i ) . Note that the ratio in ( 4 . 7 ) is scale - invariant . Without loss of generality , assume that x i realizes the minimal value of ρ / τ 0 on ( M i , ¯ g i ) . Of course x i may occur at ∂M . Now blow - up or rescale the metrics ¯ g i at x i to make ρ ( x i ) = 1 , i . e . set ( 4 . 8 ) g ′ i = λ 2 i ¯ g i , where λ i = ρ ( x i ) − 1 → ∞ . Let ρ ′ = λ i ρ and τ ′ 0 = λ i τ 0 be the L p curvature radius and distance to the cutlocus , with respect to g ′ i . Then ( 4 . 9 ) ρ ′ ( x i ) = 1 , and by the minimality property of ρ ( x i ) , ( 4 . 10 ) ρ ′ ( y i ) ≥ ρ ′ ( x i ) τ ′ 0 ( y i ) τ 0 ( x i ) = τ ′ 0 ( y i ) τ 0 ( x i ) . 20 for any y i ∈ ¯ M . Since ( 4 . 7 ) implies τ ′ 0 ( x i ) → ∞ , it follows that ( 4 . 11 ) ρ ′ ( y i ) ≥ 1 2 , for all y i with dist g ′ i ( x i , y i ) ≤ D , for any given D , provided i is suﬃciently large . Of course one also has τ ′ 0 ( y i ) → ∞ for any such y i . It follows that the metrics g ′ i have uniformly bounded curvature , on the average in L p on all unit balls of g ′ i - bounded distance to x i . For clarity , we divide the proof into two cases , according to whether dist g ′ i ( x i , ∂M ) remains bounded or not . Case I . Bounded distance . Suppose dist g ′ i ( x i , ∂M ) ≤ D , for some D < ∞ . We may then apply Proposition 4 . 1 , or more pre - cisely its local version as following the statement of Proposition 4 . 1 , to conclude that a subsequence of the metrics ( M i , g ′ i , x i ) converges in the C n , α ′ ( or stronger ) topology to a limit ( N , g ′ , x ∞ ) . ( Of course the convergence is modulo diﬀeomorphisms ) . Since τ ′ 0 ( y i ) → ∞ for any y i within bounded g ′ i - distance to x i , the limit ( N , g ′ ) is a complete manifold with boundary . Moreover , since the un - scaled boundary metrics γ i are uniformly bounded in C n , α , the limit ( ∂N , γ ′ ) = ( R n , δ ) , where δ is the ﬂat metric . Since the L p curvature radius is continuous in the C n , α ′ topology , it follows from ( 4 . 9 ) that ( 4 . 12 ) ρ ′ ( x ∞ ) = 1 . The rest of the proof in this case is to prove that ( N , g ′ ) is ﬂat . This clearly contradicts ( 4 . 12 ) , and so will complete the proof . Let ( 4 . 13 ) t ′ ( x ) = dist g ′ ( x , ∂N ) = lim i →∞ t ′ i ( x i ) , where t ′ i is the geodesic deﬁning function for ( ∂M i , g ′ i ) and x i → x . Since ∂M is totally geodesic in ( M , g ′ i ) , the smooth convergence implies ∂N = R n is totally geodesic in ( N , g ′ ) . Since τ ′ 0 = ∞ on N , t ′ is globally deﬁned and smooth on N . We now use some of the curvature properties of geodesic compactiﬁcations given in the Appendix . The equations ( A . 1 ) - ( A . 3 ) for the curvatures R ′ , Ric ′ and s ′ also hold on ( N , g ′ ) , with t ′ in place of t . We note that the Hessian D 2 t ′ = A , where A is the 2 nd fundamental form of the level sets of t ′ , and ∆ t ′ = H , the mean curvature of the level sets . By ( A . 3 ) , the scalar curvature s ′ of ( N , g ′ ) is given by ( 4 . 14 ) s ′ = − 2 n ∆ t ′ t ′ , and by ( A . 11 ) satisﬁes ( 4 . 15 ) ˙ s ′ ≥ 1 2 n 2 t ′ ( s ′ ) 2 , where ˙ s ′ = ∂s ′ / ∂t ′ . Since s γ ′ = 0 , ( A . 8 ) implies that s ′ = 0 on ∂N , and hence by ( 4 . 15 ) , s ′ ≥ 0 everywhere on N . Moreover , elementary integration of ( 4 . 15 ) implies that if , along a geodesic σ = σ ( t ′ ) normal to ∂N , s ′ ( t 0 ) > 0 , for some t 0 > 0 , then ( t ′ ) 2 ≤ t 20 + 4 n 2 / ( s ′ ( t 0 ) ) , which is impossible , since t ′ → ∞ along all geodesics normal to ∂N . It follows that one must have ( 4 . 16 ) s ′ ≡ 0 on ( N , g ′ ) . From ( 4 . 14 ) and ( 4 . 16 ) , we then have ( 4 . 17 ) ∆ t ′ = 0 , so that t ′ is a smooth harmonic function on N , with | ∇ t ′ | = 1 . 21 Now the Riccati equation ( A . 7 ) for the t ′ geodesics on ( N , g ′ ) gives ( 4 . 18 ) | A | 2 + Ric ( ∇ t ′ , ∇ t ′ ) = 0 , On the other hand , the formula ( A . 2 ) for the Ricci curvature holds , so that on ( N , g ′ ) , ( 4 . 19 ) Ric = − ( n − 1 ) t − 1 D 2 t − t − 1 ( ∆ t ) g ′ = − ( n − 1 ) t − 1 D 2 t . Here and below , we drop the prime from the notation . Clearly D 2 t ( ∇ t , ∇ t ) ≡ 0 on N , and so by ( 4 . 18 ) , | A | 2 = 0 , i . e . all the level sets are totally geodesic . Since A = D 2 t , ( 4 . 19 ) implies that Ric ≡ 0 , so that ( N , g ′ ) is Ricci - ﬂat . The vector ﬁeld ∇ t is thus a parallel vector ﬁeld , and so ( N , g ′ ) splits as a product along the ﬂow lines of ∇ t . Since ∂N = { t = 0 } is ﬂat R n , it follows that ( N , g ′ ) is ﬂat , as claimed . Case II . Unbounded distance . Suppose t ′ i ( x i ) = dist g ′ i ( x i , ∂M ) → ∞ , as i → ∞ . Using ( 4 . 7 ) again , exactly the same arguments as in ( 4 . 14 ) - ( 4 . 19 ) applied to ( M i , g ′ i , x i ) show that , for i suﬃciently large , ( M i , g ′ i ) almost splits in regions of bounded diameter about x i , in that such regions are topologically products and the ﬂow by the integral curves of t ′ i are almost isometries of g ′ i . More precisely , suppose ﬁrst that ( M i , g ′ i , x i ) does not collapse near x i . Then , exactly as in Case I , by the strong control property , ( M i , g ′ i , x i ) is close in the C n , α ′ topology , to a product metric in regions of g ′ i - bounded diameter about x i . Suppose instead ( M i , g ′ i , x i ) collapses near x i . The strong control property implies the collapse is with bounded curvature . Clearly the collapse , which is caused by short geodesic loops , is transverse to the ﬂow lines of t ′ i . By the general collapse theory , cf . [ 15 ] , the collapse may be unwrapped in local covering spaces . Thus , there are covering spaces of balls of ﬁxed but small diameter about x i such that the lifted metrics on the covers do not collapse , and so converge in C n , α ′ to a local limit . All of the estimates ( 4 . 14 ) - ( 4 . 19 ) remain valid on such local covers , and since these are pointwise estimates transverse to the collapsing directions , it follows again that the original metrics ( M i , g ′ i , x i ) are close in C n , α ′ to a product metric in regions of g ′ i - bounded diameter about x i . This shows that ρ ′ i is almost constant in such regions , and , ( again by the strong control property ) , ( 4 . 20 ) ∂ρ ′ i ∂t ′ i ∼ 0 . Note that ∂ρ / ∂t is scale - invariant , ( as are the ratios ρ / t and ρ / τ 0 ) . The argument above was carried out at the base points x i . However , exactly the same reasoning shows that ( 4 . 20 ) holds at all points p i where ( ρ / τ 0 ) ( p i ) < < 1 . Now integrate ( 4 . 20 ) along integral curves σ i of t ′ i starting at points y i of bounded g ′ i - distance to x i in the direction toward ∂M . Since ρ ′ i ( y i ) ∼ 1 and t ′ i ( y i ) → ∞ , this implies in particular that the scale - invariant ratio ρ / t on ( M i , g ′ i ) satisﬁes ( 4 . 21 ) ρ ′ i t ′ i < < 1 , along such curves , all the way to ∂M , since ρ / τ 0 < < 1 along such curves . However , this is clearly impossible , since again the arguments in Case I imply that ( M i , g ′ i ) is almost ﬂat within bounded g ′ i - distance to ∂M , so that ρ ′ i ≥ ( 1 − δ ) t ′ i in such regions , where δ is small for i large . In other words , ( 4 . 20 ) and ( 4 . 21 ) prevent the ratio ρ / t , which is arbitrarily small around x i , from increasing to near 1 near ∂M . This contradiction completes the proof . Note that the opposite inequality to ( 4 . 5 ) also holds , i . e . ( 4 . 22 ) ρ ( x ) ≤ τ 0 ( x ) . 22 This is essentially a tautology , since the metric ¯ g is singular at the cutlocus and so ρ - balls are not deﬁned past the cutlocus . The proof of Proposition 4 . 5 does not use the strong control property with m − 1 ≥ n . Basically , it suﬃces to have this property in any norm stronger than the L 2 , p norm , so that the L p curvature radius is continuous . However , the condition m − 1 > n will be crucial in the next result . The next step in the proof of Theorem 4 . 3 is to prove that τ 0 is uniformly bounded below near ∂M . Proposition 4 . 6 . For ( M , g ) as in Theorem 4 . 4 , there is a constant µ 1 > 0 , depending only on K , α and p , such that , for any x ∈ ∂M , ( 4 . 23 ) τ 0 ( x ) ≥ µ 1 . Proof : The proof of this estimate is much more subtle than that of Proposition 4 . 5 . Propositions 4 . 1 and 4 . 5 are essentially local results ; they hold for AH Einstein metrics deﬁned only in a geodesic collar neighborhood of ∂M , t ∈ [ 0 , ε 0 ] , for some ε 0 > 0 . However , Proposition 4 . 6 , ( and hence Theorem 4 . 4 ) , is global ; it requires g to be an AH Einstein metric deﬁned on a compact manifold M , with conformal boundary ∂M at inﬁnity . We ﬁrst prove some preliminary lemmas , which are basically straightforward consequences of the strong control property . The actual proof begins after the proof of Lemma 4 . 9 ; on a ﬁrst reading , one might want to start at this point to understand how the Lemmas are used . The crux of the proof is the use of the relation ( 2 . 22 ) in Proposition 2 . 4 . It is this relation in particular , ( as well as Lemma 4 . 7 ) , which requires ( M , g ) is global . To begin , we examine the geometry of the geodesic compactiﬁcation ¯ g in regions where τ 0 is very small , in fact possibly arbitrarily small . Thus suppose ( M i , g i ) is a sequence of AH Einstein metrics with boundary metrics γ i on ∂M i = ∂M uniformly controlled in C m , α , m ≥ n + 1 . Hence , a subsequence of γ i converges in C m , α ′ to a limit C m , α boundary metric γ . Let x i be any sequence of points in M i such that ( 4 . 24 ) τ 0 ( x i ) → 0 . Rescale the compactiﬁed metrics ¯ g i to ( 4 . 25 ) g ′ i = ( τ 0 ( x i ) ) − 2 ¯ g i , so that ( 4 . 26 ) τ ′ 0 ( x i ) = 1 . By Proposition 4 . 5 and ( 4 . 22 ) , ρ ′ ( x i ) is uniformly bounded above and below . Hence as in the proof of Proposition 4 . 5 , a subsequence of ( M , g ′ i , x i ) converges in the C n , α ′ topology ( modulo diﬀeomorphisms ) , to a maximal limit ( N , g ′ , x ∞ ) ; maximal here means the maximal connected domain on which the convergence is C n , α ′ . The manifold N has boundary - at - inﬁnity ∂N a domain in R n , with boundary metric the ﬂat metric γ ′ = δ , and containing the ball B x ∞ ( 1 ) in R n . However , in this case , N is not complete away from its boundary , since τ ′ 0 ( x ∞ ) ≤ 1 . Consider now also the sequence of AH Einstein metrics g i on M i , with conformal compactiﬁcation ¯ g i , with base points x i chosen above . Of course dist ¯ g i ( x i , ∂M ) → 0 . The metrics ¯ g i are rescaled up to g ′ i = λ 2 i ¯ g i , λ i = ( τ 0 ( x i ) ) − 1 , and converge , ( in a subsequence ) , in C n , α ′ to the maximal limit ( N , g ′ , x ) . Now the rescaling of ¯ g i just corresponds to changing the deﬁning function t i to t ′ i = λ i t i . Thus it does not change g i itself ; in fact g i = ( t ′ i ) − 2 g ′ i . Since t ′ i → t ′ and g ′ i → g ′ on N , it follows that the pointed sequence of AH Einstein metrics ( M i , g i , x i ) converges to a limit AH Einstein metric ( N , g ∞ , x ∞ ) . Again here N is the maximal connected domain containing x ∞ on which the convergence is C n , α ′ ; in fact the convergence is now C ∞ smooth on compact subsets , by regularity 23 properties of Einstein metrics . The limit ( N , g ∞ ) is of course not conformally compact in general ; the “compactiﬁcation” of ( N , g ∞ ) by t gives the manifold ( N , g ′ ) , i . e . ( 4 . 27 ) g ∞ = t − 2 g ′ , where N ⊂ N is the region where t is smooth . The ﬁrst result is an analogue of ( 4 . 12 ) in this setting . Lemma 4 . 7 . Any blow - up limit manifold ( N , g ′ , x ∞ ) is not ﬂat . Proof : If ( N , g ′ ) is ﬂat , then by ( 4 . 27 ) , ( N , g ∞ ) is hyperbolic , i . e . of constant curvature - 1 , and so locally embeds in the hyperbolic space H n + 1 ( − 1 ) . By construction , the maximal limit ( N , g ∞ ) is not complete ; it has a “boundary” corresponding to the points where ρ g i → 0 . However , the pointed sequence ( M i , g i , x i ) of complete manifolds has a uniform lower bound on Ricci curvature , since the metrics are Einstein , and is non - collapsing at points within bounded distance to x i . By the Gromov weak compactness theorem [ 22 ] , a subsequence of ( M i , g i , x i ) converges in the pointed Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology to a limit ( ¯ N , d , x ) , where ( ¯ N , d ) is a complete , non - compact , length space . In particular , ( ¯ N , d ) is geodesically complete ; any two points may be joined by a minimizing geodesic and all geodesic balls B x ( r ) in ¯ N have compact closure strictly contained in ¯ N . Clearly the smooth domain ( N , g ∞ ) embeds in ( ¯ N , d ) . By a result of Cheeger - Colding [ 13 ] , the singular set ∂ N = ¯ N \ N of ¯ N is of codimension 2 in ¯ N . In particular the metric boundary ∂ N is not a topological boundary , ( which would have codimension 1 ) . By the volume comparison theorem ( 3 . 31 ) on ( M i , g i ) , the ratio volB iz ( r ) / volB − 1 ( r ) is monotone non - increasing in r , where B iz ( r ) is the geodesic r - ball about any z in ( M i , g i ) and volB − 1 ( r ) is the volume of the geodesic r - ball in H n + 1 ( − 1 ) . Further , for any given i , lim r → 0 volB iz ( r ) / volB − 1 ( r ) = 1 . A fundamental result of Colding [ 14 ] , cf . also [ 13 ] , shows that the volume of geodesic balls is continuous under Gromov - Hausdorﬀ limits so that in ( ¯ N , d ) , volB z ( r ) / volB − 1 ( r ) is also monotone non - decreasing , and hence lim r → 0 volB z ( r ) / volB − 1 ( r ) ≤ 1 , with equality for z ∈ N . Now suppose ﬁrst for simplicity of argument that N is simply connected . Since N is of constant curvature − 1 , the developing map based at any point in N gives an isometric immersion F : N → H n + 1 ( − 1 ) . Observe that the image of F is of full measure in H n + 1 ( − 1 ) ; this is because ¯ N is complete , so that geodesics do not terminate , and ∂ N is of codimension 2 and so of measure 0 . In fact F extends to a continuous map of ¯ N onto H n + 1 ( − 1 ) . It follows that F maps B z ( r ) onto B F ( z ) ( r ) ⊂ H n + 1 ( − 1 ) modulo sets of measure 0 . Moreover , F preserves the volumes of these balls when counting multiplicities of the image , so that ( 4 . 28 ) volB z ( r ) volB − 1 ( r ) ≥ volF ( B z ( r ) ) volB − 1 ( r ) = 1 . Since by the monotonicity above one has ( 4 . 29 ) volB z ( r ) volB − 1 ( r ) ≤ 1 , for all r , it is then immediate that ( 4 . 30 ) volB z ( r ) volB − 1 ( r ) = 1 , for all r . This of course implies that ¯ N is isometric to H n + 1 ( − 1 ) , by the volume rigidity theorem for Ricci curvature . Moreover , by [ 2 , Thm . 3 . 2 ] , the sequence ( M i , g i , x i ) now converges smoothly to ( ¯ N , g ∞ , x ∞ ) everywhere . In particular , τ 0 = ∞ , contradicting the fact that τ 0 ( x ∞ ) = 1 from ( 4 . 26 ) . The proof is similar when N is not simply connected . Thus , let e N be the universal cover of N . ( For illustration , it is useful to picture e N as a branched cover of ¯ N branched over the singular 24 locus ∂ N ) . Then the developing map F is an isometric immersion of e N into H n + 1 ( − 1 ) . Let D be a Dirichlet fundamental domain for the action of π 1 ( N ) on e N , based at a point z ∈ N . Modulo sets of measure 0 , D may be identiﬁed with N , and F gives an isometric immersion F : D → H n + 1 ( − 1 ) . Now however ∂D is of codimension 1 and D , ( or ¯ D ) , is not geodesically complete ; the action of π 1 ( N ) identiﬁes subsets of ∂D to obtain the manifold N or its completion ¯ N . Nevertheless , letting S z ( r ) be the geodesic r - sphere about z in N , or equivalently in D modulo sets of measure 0 , and letting S F ( z ) ( r ) be the corresponding sphere in H n + 1 ( − 1 ) , we claim that ( 4 . 31 ) lim sup r →∞ volS z ( r ) vol − 1 ( S F ( z ) ( r ) ) ≥ 1 . To prove ( 4 . 31 ) , recall the construction of the blow - up limit N and its compactiﬁcation N with conformal inﬁnity given by the domain ∂N ⊂ R n . View the codimension 2 singular set S = ∂ N as a subset of the compactiﬁcation ¯ N , and suppose ﬁrst for clarity that S intersects the full conformal boundary R n in a closed set S ∞ also of codimension 2 in R n . Then ∂N = R n \ S ∞ , and so in particular ∂N is of full measure in R n . As r → ∞ , the geodesic spheres S z ( r ) in N , ( or D ) , tend to ∂N . Then , as in the proof of ( 4 . 28 ) , ( 4 . 31 ) follows from the fact that ∂N is a set of full measure in the conformal compactiﬁcation S n = R n ∪ { ∞ } of H n + 1 ( − 1 ) . Now the same argument holds regardless of the exact structure of the singular set S ∞ ⊂ R n , since it is still the case that S z ( r ) ⊂ N is of full measure in ¯ S z ( r ) ⊂ ¯ N and lim r →∞ ¯ S z ( r ) = R n . By integration , the estimate ( 4 . 31 ) also holds for balls B z ( r ) and the relation ( 4 . 30 ) then follows from ( 4 . 29 ) as before . We point out that the same proof shows that ( N , g ′ , x ∞ ) cannot be conformally ﬂat . This is because ( 4 . 27 ) would then imply that the metric ( N , g ∞ ) is conformally ﬂat and Einstein , and hence again hyperbolic ; the proof then proceeds just as before . In the following , we write ( 4 . 32 ) φ ∼ 1 , if there is a constant C < ∞ such that C − 1 ≤ φ ≤ C . The data φ will be determined by ( M , g ) as in Theorem 4 . 4 , but C is required to be independent of ( M , g ) . The next result , which is of independent interest , relates the curvature radius ρ with the stress - energy term τ ( n ) in ( 2 . 12 ) . Lemma 4 . 8 . For ( M , g ) as in Theorem 4 . 4 , and for any x ∈ ∂M with τ 0 ( x ) suﬃciently small , one has the estimate ( 4 . 33 ) ρ n ( x ) · sup y ∈ B x ( 12 ρ ( x ) ) | τ ( n ) | ( y ) ∼ 1 . The same estimate holds for g ( n ) in place of τ ( n ) . Proof : Observe that the product in ( 4 . 33 ) is scale invariant , cf . also ( 2 . 14 ) . Suppose ﬁrst that there exists a sequence of metrics ( M i , g i ) and points x i ∈ ∂M i , such that ( 4 . 34 ) ρ n ( x i ) · sup y ∈ B xi ( 12 ρ ( x i ) ) | τ ( n , i ) | ( y ) → 0 . We work in the scale ˆ g i = ρ ( x i ) − 2 ¯ g i where ( 4 . 35 ) ˆ ρ ( x i ) = 1 , so that ˆ τ 0 ( x i ) ∼ 1 . The estimate ( 4 . 34 ) implies | ˆ τ ( n , i ) | ( y ) < < 1 , for all y ∈ ˆ B x i ( 12 ) . By Proposition 4 . 1 , ( or the strong control property ) , the rescaled metrics ˆ g i converge ( in a subsequence ) in the C n , α ′ topology to a limit metric ˆ g on a maximal connected domain ( U , x ∞ ) where ˆ ρ does not converge to 0 , ( i . e . the region where the curvature of ˆ g i does not blow - up in L p ) . Of course B x ∞ ( 1 ) ⊂ U . As noted prior to Lemma 4 . 7 , the blow - up limit of the metric γ on ∂M is the ﬂat metric on R n . 25 Now the C n , α ′ convergence implies that ( 4 . 36 ) τ ( n ) = 0 , on ∂U . Since the boundary metric is ﬂat , this implies that g ( n ) = 0 , cf . [ 18 ] , [ 33 ] . The unique continuation property , Proposition 2 . 1 , then implies that ( U , ˆ g ) is ﬂat , which however contradicts Lemma 4 . 7 . The proof of the opposite inequality in ( 4 . 33 ) is similar . Thus , suppose there exist ( M i , g i ) and points x i ∈ ∂M such that ρ n ( x i ) · sup y ∈ B xi ( 12 ρ ( x i ) ) | τ ( n , i ) | ( y ) > > 1 . Now work in the scale where sup y ∈ B xi ( 12 ρ ( x i ) ) | τ ( n , i ) | ( y ) = 1 , and at points y i realizing this supremum . In this scale , ( using the fact that ρ is Lipschitz , with Lipschitz constant 1 ) , ρ ( y i ) > > 1 . Hence , via ( 4 . 22 ) , τ 0 ( y i ) > > 1 in this scale . Then the same arguments as in ( 4 . 14 ) - ( 4 . 19 ) together with the strong control property imply that the metric is C n , α ′ close to the ﬂat metric , in bounded domains about y i . It follows that τ ( n ) and g ( n ) are ( arbitrarily ) small in bounded domains about y i for i suﬃciently large , which gives a contradiction to the scale normalization above . Note that the strong control property implies further that the product in ( 4 . 33 ) is bounded away from 0 and ∞ in C α ′ . Now consider a conformal rescaling of the metric ¯ g in place of the constant rescalings used before . Thus , set ( 4 . 37 ) e g = ρ ( x ) − 2 ¯ g . Apriori , the function ρ may not be smooth in x , and so ( 4 . 37 ) should be replaced by the expression e g = ρ s ( x ) − 2 ¯ g , where ρ s is a C ∞ smoothing of ρ satisfying 12 ρ ≤ ρ s ≤ ρ . Thus , in the following , ( 4 . 37 ) is understood with respect to ρ s in place of ρ ; however , to keep the notation reasonable , and also because this diﬀerence is only of minor signiﬁcance , we continue to work the notation ρ . If one sets ˆ g = τ − 2 0 ( x ) ¯ g , then by ( 4 . 5 ) and ( 4 . 22 ) the two metrics e g and ˆ g are C - quasi - isometric , i . e . ( 4 . 38 ) ˆ g ∼ e g , in the sense of ( 4 . 32 ) . Let e ρ be the L p curvature radius of ( M , e g ) and similarly for e r m − 1 , α h . Also , let e g ( n ) be the n th term in the Feﬀerman - Graham expansion ( 2 . 9 ) - ( 2 . 10 ) for the geodesic compactiﬁcation of ( M , g ) determined by the boundary metric e γ = e g | ∂M , and similarly for the stress - energy term e τ ( n ) . Lemma 4 . 9 . Let ( M , g ) be as in Theorem 4 . 4 . Then on ( M , e g ) , for all x ∈ ∂M , one has the estimates ( 4 . 39 ) e ρ ( x ) ∼ 1 , and e r m − 1 , α h ( x ) ∼ 1 . These estimates also hold for the geodesic compactiﬁcation determined by e γ . Further , for ρ ( x ) suﬃciently small , ( 4 . 40 ) sup y ∈ B x ( 12 ) e τ ( n ) ( y ) ∼ 1 . Proof : We ﬁrst prove e ρ is bounded below on ∂M . To do this , standard formulas for the behavior of the curvature under conformal changes give e R = ρ − 2 [ R − g ∧ ( D 2 log ρ − 1 − ( d log ρ ) 2 + 12 | d log ρ | 2 g ) ] , 26 where ∧ denotes the Kulkarni - Nomizu product , cf . [ 10 ] . Hence , ( 4 . 41 ) | e R | e g ≤ c ( ρ 2 | R | + ρ | D 2 ρ | + | dρ | 2 ) , where the right side is taken with respect to ¯ g and we recall the remark on smoothing following ( 4 . 37 ) . Note also that the right side of ( 4 . 41 ) is scale invariant . Thus , it suﬃces to obtain an L p or L ∞ bound of the terms on the right in ( 4 . 41 ) , in the scale where ρ = 1 , on balls of radius r 0 , for a uniform r 0 > 0 . Since the function ρ is Lipschitz , with Lipschitz constant 1 , the last term is bounded in L ∞ . By the strong control property , the ﬁrst two terms are also bounded in L ∞ on the ball of radius 12 . This gives a uniform upper bound on | e R | e g on the ball of radius 12 and hence e ρ ≥ ρ 0 , for a ﬁxed ρ 0 , ( depending only on the constant c 0 in ( 3 . 4 ) ) . Also , since ( M , ¯ g ) satisﬁes the strong control property , in the scale where ρ ( x ) = 1 one has a uniform lower bound on r m − 1 , α h , r m − 1 , α h ( x ) ≥ r 0 , which again via ( 4 . 41 ) gives a lower bound on e r m − 1 , α h on ∂M . The opposite estimate e ρ ( x ) ≤ ρ 1 ρ ( x ) , for a ﬁxed ρ 1 < ∞ , also holds . For if , on some sequence ( M i , ¯ g i , x i ) , e ρ ( x i ) → ∞ while ρ ( x i ) = 1 , then the metric e g i is almost ﬂat in L p in large balls B x i ( ( 1 − δ ) e ρ ( x i ) ) , for any ﬁxed δ > 0 . It follows that any maximal limit ( N , g ′∞ , x ∞ ) , as following ( 4 . 25 ) , is conformally ﬂat . As noted following Lemma 4 . 7 , this contradicts ( the proof of ) Lemma 4 . 7 . Combining the arguments above proves ( 4 . 39 ) . Next , the estimate ( 4 . 39 ) gives uniform control in C m − 1 , α of the conformal factor relating the geodesic compactiﬁcation with respect to e g and the rescaling of ¯ g by the constant factor ρ ( x ) − 2 , for any ﬁxed x . This implies that ( 4 . 39 ) also holds for the geodesic compactiﬁcation with respect to e g . In particular , this gives an upper bound on the term e τ ( n ) in ( 4 . 40 ) . Regarding the lower bound , suppose ﬁrst n is odd . Then the lower bound on e τ ( n ) in ( 4 . 40 ) follows immediately from ( 4 . 33 ) and the conformal transformation rule ( 2 . 14 ) . A similar argument holds also for n even . Thus , although ( 2 . 14 ) does not hold exactly , it does hold modulo terms which involve lower order derivatives of the boundary metric ; for ρ ( x ) suﬃciently small , these terms scale at a lower power of ρ ( x ) − 1 than g ( n ) , so that ( 2 . 14 ) holds to leading order . We are now in position to begin the proof of Proposition 4 . 6 per se . Suppose then ( 4 . 23 ) is false . Then there exist AH Einstein metrics ( M i , g i ) with C m , α controlled boundary metrics γ i and points x i such that τ 0 ( x i ) → 0 , and so ( 4 . 42 ) ρ i ( x i ) → 0 , where ρ i is the L p curvature radius of the geodesic compactiﬁcation ¯ g i of g i with boundary metric γ i . From now on , we work in the conformally rescaled metric ( 4 . 37 ) . The Lipschitz property of ρ , together with ( 4 . 42 ) implies that ( 4 . 43 ) vol e γ i ( ∂M ) → ∞ . The main point now is to use the relation ( 2 . 22 ) in the e γ i metric : ( 4 . 44 ) Z ∂M hL X τ ( n ) + [ ( 1 − 2 n ) divX ] τ ( n ) , h ( 0 ) i dV e γ i = Z ∂M h σ ( n ) + 12 trh ( 0 ) τ ( n ) , ˆ L X γ i dV e γ i + b ( n ) . Here we have dropped the i and tilde from the notation ; the inner product in ( 4 . 44 ) as well as τ ( n ) and σ ( n ) are taken with respect to e γ i ; also the term b ( n ) is given by the last term in ( 2 . 22 ) . Recall from ( 2 . 12 ) that τ ( n ) is determined by g ( n ) and the boundary metric . By ( 2 . 21 ) and Lemma 2 . 2 , σ ( n ) is any solution of the system ( 4 . 45 ) δσ ( n ) = − δ ′ ( τ ( n ) ) , trσ ( n ) = − tr ′ ( τ ( n ) ) + ( a ( n ) ) ′ , 27 where δ ′ , tr ′ and ( a ( n ) ) ′ are the variations of δ , tr and a ( n ) at ( ∂M , e γ i ) in the direction h ( 0 ) . Of course solutions σ ( n ) of ( 4 . 45 ) are invariant under the addition of transverse - traceless terms , as is ( 4 . 44 ) . We point out that the system of equations ( 4 . 45 ) is conformally invariant , since these equations deﬁne formal solutions to the conformally compactiﬁed linearized Einstein equations . In more detail , a conformal change of the boundary metric induces a conformal change of h ( 0 ) ; as described in and following ( 2 . 14 ) , such conformal changes in turn induce a transformation of τ ( n ) , a ( n ) and σ ( n ) . The space of solutions of ( 4 . 45 ) is thus transformed into itself under changes in the conformal compactiﬁcation of solutions of the linearized Einstein equations . Consider then the equations ( 4 . 45 ) on ( ∂M , γ i ) , and set γ i = γ . We ﬁrst claim that the system ( 4 . 45 ) is solvable for any variation h ( 0 ) of ( ∂M , γ ) , and hence , by Proposition 2 . 4 , ( 4 . 44 ) also holds for all such variations h ( 0 ) . To see this , by Lemma 2 . 2 and Proposition 2 . 3 , we know that each equation in ( 4 . 45 ) is individually solvable , and thus need to show that the equations are simultaneously solvable . As is well - known , any symmetric bilinear form σ on ( ∂M , γ ) can be written uniquely as σ = δ ∗ V + fγ + k , where k is transverse - traceless . Setting − δ ′ ( τ ( n ) ) = φ 1 , − tr ′ ( τ ( n ) ) + a ′ ( n ) = φ 2 , the system ( 4 . 45 ) becomes ( 4 . 46 ) δδ ∗ V − 1 ndδV = φ 1 + 1 ndφ 2 , − δV + nf = φ 2 . By Proposition 2 . 3 , the term φ 1 ∈ Imδ , and similarly dφ 2 ∈ Imδ , since for any Killing ﬁeld X on ( ∂M , γ ) , h dφ 2 , X i = h φ 2 , δX i = 0 . Thus , the ﬁrst equation is solvable for V , and hence the second equation is solvable for f , which proves the claim . Note that the ﬁrst equation in ( 4 . 46 ) is an elliptic equation for V . Next , we claim there is a solution σ ( n ) = δ ∗ V + fγ of ( 4 . 45 ) on ( ∂M , γ ) , ( γ = γ i ) , such that ( 4 . 47 ) | | σ ( n ) | | C m − n , α ≤ C | | h ( 0 ) | | C m − n , α | | τ ( n ) | | C m − n , α , where C depends only on K in Theorem 4 . 4 . This follows directly from standard elliptic estimates for V associated to the equation ( 4 . 46 ) , ( choosing V orthogonal to the kernel of the operator ) , together with the fact that γ i are uniformly bounded in C m , α . Transforming then to the conformally related metrics e γ i and using the fact ( 4 . 39 ) that τ ( n ) is uniformly controlled in C α then gives ( 4 . 48 ) | | σ ( n ) | | C α ≤ C | | h ( 0 ) | | C α , for a ﬁxed constant C , independent of i , where σ ( n ) and the norms are taken with respect to the e γ i metric . Let Z i = { x ∈ ∂M : ρ i ( x ) ≤ ε i } , for some sequence ε i → 0 . For any x i ∈ Z i , by Lemma 4 . 9 the pointed sequence ( ∂M , e γ i , x i ) converges in C n , α ′ , and uniformly on compact sets , to a complete conformally ﬂat metric e γ ∞ on a domain V ⊂ ∂M . The metric e γ ∞ is conformally ﬂat because one is conformally blowing up the sequence of smoothly controlled metrics γ i on ∂M . Of course , the convergence is modulo diﬀeomorphisms which blow - up small regions in ∂M to unit size . Thus , there exist embeddings F i : V → ∂M such that ( F i ) ∗ e γ i → e γ ∞ . For example , if x i realizes the minimal value of ρ i in ( 4 . 42 ) , then e γ ∞ is a complete conformally ﬂat metric on R n . Other choices of base points may lead to complete conformally ﬂat metrics on R × S n − 1 for example . In general , since the conformal class [ γ i ] is controlled in C m , α , the limit domain V is contained in R n , with closure ¯ V = R n . Similarly , the forms τ ( n , i ) and σ ( n , i ) converge in C α ′ to limit forms τ ( n ) and σ ( n ) on V ; recall that the tilde has been dropped from the notation . For the same reasons , since the metrics e g i satisfy ( 4 . 39 ) , the pointed sequence ( M i , e g i , x i ) also converges , in C n , α ′ , to a maximal connected limit ( N , e g ∞ , x ∞ ) , with boundary data ( V , e γ ∞ ) . 28 Let Y be any C 2 smooth vector ﬁeld on ∂M . The vector ﬁelds X i = ( F i ) ∗ Y are blow - ups of Y based at x i and converge to a conformal Killing ﬁeld X ∞ on ( V , e γ ∞ ) , so that ( 4 . 49 ) ˆ L X i e γ i → ˆ L X ∞ e γ ∞ = 0 . Similarly , since the metrics γ i are bounded in C n , α , the terms a ( n ) are also bounded , and hence , wirh respect to the boundary metrics e γ i , ( a ( n ) ) i → 0 pointwise . Combining then ( 4 . 44 ) with ( 4 . 43 ) and ( 4 . 48 ) , it thus follows that for i large , ( 4 . 50 ) sup | Y | ≤ 1 sup | h ( 0 ) | ≤ 1 | Z ∂M h e L X i τ ( n , i ) , h ( 0 ) i dV e γ i | < < vol e γ i ( ∂M ) , where e L X τ ( n ) = L X τ ( n ) + [ ( 1 − 2 n ) divX ] τ ( n ) , | h ( 0 ) | = | | h ( 0 ) | | C α ( e γ i ) , and | Y | = | | Y | | C 2 ( γ i ) ∼ | | Y | | C 2 ( γ ∞ ) . Since h ( 0 ) is arbitrary , it follows from ( 4 . 50 ) that there exist ( possibly many ) regions where ρ i → 0 , for which , on a complete , conformally ﬂat limit ( V , e γ ∞ , x ∞ ) of the boundary , one has ( 4 . 51 ) e L X ∞ τ ( n ) = 0 , for any conformal Killing ﬁeld X ∞ on ( V , e γ ∞ ) . We claim that the only solution of ( 4 . 51 ) , ( for all conformal Killing X ∞ ) , is ( 4 . 52 ) τ ( n ) = 0 . To see this , a well - known relation gives L X τ ( n ) = ∇ X τ ( n ) + 2 δ ∗ X ◦ τ ( n ) , so that if X = X ∞ is conformal Killing , then L X ∞ τ ( n ) = ∇ X ∞ τ ( n ) + 2 n ( divX ∞ ) τ ( n ) . Hence ( 4 . 51 ) gives ( 4 . 53 ) ∇ X ∞ τ ( n ) = − ( divX ∞ ) τ ( n ) , for all conformal Killing ﬁelds X ∞ . Pairing ( 4 . 53 ) with τ ( n ) gives ( 4 . 54 ) 1 2 X ∞ ( | τ ( n ) | 2 ) = − ( divX ∞ ) | τ ( n ) | 2 . Hence , if τ ( n ) 6 = 0 , then X ∞ ( log | τ ( n ) | ) = − divX ∞ , so that by ( 4 . 53 ) , ∇ X ∞ ( | τ ( n ) | − 1 τ ( n ) ) = 0 . Since ( V , e γ ∞ ) is conformally ﬂat and X ∞ is an arbitrary conformal Killing ﬁeld , this easily implies that | τ ( n ) | is constant , which from ( 4 . 54 ) implies ( 4 . 52 ) . Since the convergence of ( M i , e g i , x i ) to ( N , e g ∞ , x ∞ ) is C n , α ′ , ( 4 . 52 ) contradicts ( 4 . 39 ) , which proves Proposition 4 . 6 . ( Equivalently , ( 4 . 52 ) can be shown to imply that the the blow - up limit ( N , g ′ , x ∞ ) of ( M i , ¯ g i , x i ) as preceding Lemma 4 . 7 is ﬂat , contradicting Lemma 4 . 7 ) . Propositions 4 . 5 and 4 . 6 together imply Theorem 4 . 4 , which also completes the proof of this result . Combining Proposition 4 . 1 and Theorem 4 . 4 gives the following main result of this section . Corollary 4 . 10 . On a ﬁxed 4 - manifold M , suppose g ∈ E m , α AH , m ≥ 4 , has boundary metric γ satisfying | | γ | | C m , α ≤ K in a ﬁxed coordinate atlas for ∂M . Then there exists δ 1 = δ 1 ( K ) > 0 such that the C m − 1 , α geometry of the geodesic compactiﬁcations ¯ g is uniformly controlled in U δ 1 , in that ( 4 . 2 ) holds , with r 0 depending only on K . The same result holds in all dimensions in which the strong control property holds . 29 5 . Properness of the Boundary Map . In this section , we combine the results of § 3 and § 4 to prove Theorem A , i . e . the properness of Π . Following this , in § 5 . 2 , we also analyse the behavior when Π is not proper and prove this is solely due to the formation of Einstein cusp metrics , cf . Theorem 5 . 4 and the discussion following it . 5 . 1 . Corollary 4 . 10 gives uniform C m − 1 , α control of the geodesic compactiﬁcation of an AH Einstein metric ( M , g ) in a neighborhood of deﬁnite size about ∂M , in terms of C m , α control of the boundary metric γ . Theorem 3 . 7 addresses control in the interior , away from the boundary . Regarding the hypotheses ( 3 . 17 ) - ( 3 . 21 ) of Theorem 3 . 7 , the assumption ( 3 . 19 ) on a lower bound on the inradius of ¯ g and the assumption ( 3 . 20 ) on an upper bound on the diameter T of S ( t 1 ) are now immediate consequences of Corollary 4 . 10 . Next we show that there is a global L 2 bound on W , i . e . ( 3 . 21 ) holds . Proposition 5 . 1 . Let ( M , g ) be an AH Einstein metric on a 4 - manifold M , with boundary metric γ . Then there is a constant Λ , depending only on the topology of M and the C 4 , α norm of γ , such that ( 5 . 1 ) Z M | W g | 2 dV g ≤ Λ . Proof : The integral ( 5 . 1 ) is conformally invariant . In the tubular neighborhood U = U µ 1 about ∂M , ( cf . ( 4 . 23 ) ) , we compute the L 2 integral ( 5 . 1 ) with respect to the compactiﬁcation ¯ g , while in M \ U , the integral is computed with respect to the Einstein metric g . Thus , by Corollary 4 . 10 , the curvature ¯ R of ¯ g is uniformly bounded in U . Since vol γ ∂M is also uniformly bounded , the curvature bound also gives a uniform upper bound on the volume of ( U , ¯ g ) . Hence , by conformal invariance , the integral over U in ( 5 . 1 ) is uniformly bounded . For the integral over M \ U , we use the Chern - Gauss - Bonnet theorem for manifolds with bound - ary , as in [ 5 ] . Let S ( t 0 ) = ∂U µ 0 , µ 0 = µ 1 / 2 , viewed as a boundary in ( M , g ) , and let Ω = M \ U µ 0 . Since ( Ω , g ) is Einstein , one has , 1 8 π 2 Z Ω | W | 2 dV = 1 8 π 2 Z Ω ( | R | 2 − 6 ) = χ ( Ω ) − 3 4 π 2 vol Ω + Z S ( t 1 ) B ( R , A ) ≤ χ ( M ) + Z S ( t 1 ) B ( R , A ) ; compare also with ( 3 . 16 ) . Here B ( R , A ) is a boundary term , depending on the curvature R and second fundamental form A of S ( t 0 ) in ( M , g ) . But again by Corollary 4 . 10 , R and A are uniformly controlled on S ( t 0 ) ⊂ ( M , g ) , as is vol g S ( t 0 ) . Hence , the L 2 norm of W over Ω is uniformly bounded and so ( 5 . 1 ) follows . We now assemble the work above to obtain the following result , which represents the major part of Theorem A . Recall from [ 6 ] that if ( M , g ) is an AH Einstein metric and ¯ g is a geodesic compactiﬁcation , then its width W id ¯ g M is deﬁned by ( 5 . 2 ) W id ¯ g M = sup { t ( x ) : x ∈ M } . The width depends on a choice of the boundary metric γ for the conformal inﬁnity . However , if γ and γ ′ are representatives in [ γ ] , then C − 1 W id ¯ g M ≤ W id ¯ g ′ M ≤ CW id ¯ g M , where C depends only on the C 1 norm of γ − 1 γ ′ and ( γ ′ ) − 1 γ in a ﬁxed coordinate system on ∂M . Theorem 5 . 2 . Let { g i } be a sequence of AH Einstein metrics on M , with boundary metrics γ i and suppose γ i → γ in the C m , α ′ topology on ∂M , m ≥ 4 . Suppose further that ( 5 . 3 ) H 2 ( ∂M , R ) → H 2 ( ¯ M , R ) → 0 , 30 and there is a constant D < ∞ such that ( 5 . 4 ) W id ¯ g i M ≤ D . Then a subsequence of { g i } converges smoothly and uniformly on compact subsets to an AH Einstein metric g on M with boundary metric γ . The geodesic compactiﬁcations ¯ g i converge in the C m − 1 , α ′ topology to the geodesic compactiﬁcation ¯ g of g , within a ﬁxed collar neighborhood U of ∂M . Proof : Corollary 4 . 10 proves the last statement . As noted above , together with Proposition 5 . 1 , it follows that the all the hypotheses ( 3 . 17 ) - ( 3 . 21 ) of Theorem 3 . 7 are satisﬁed . Thus if one chooses base points x i satisfying ( 3 . 22 ) , then a subsequence of ( M , g i , x i ) converges smoothly and uniformly on compact sets , to a limit AH Einstein metric ( N , g , x ) . For a ﬁxed d > 0 small , let ( 5 . 5 ) ( M i ) d = { x ∈ ( M , g i ) : t i ( x ) ≤ d } , and deﬁne N d in the same way . Then the smooth convergence of the compactiﬁcations ¯ g i implies that ( M i ) 2 d is diﬀeomorphic to N 2 d and each is a collar neighborhood of ∂M . Further , the limit metric g on N 2 d is AH , with boundary metric γ . On the other hand , ( 5 . 4 ) implies that the complementary domains ( 5 . 6 ) ( M i ) d = { x ∈ ( M , g i ) : t i ( x ) ≥ d } have uniformly bounded diameter with respect to g i , and so Theorem 3 . 7 implies that ( M i ) d / 2 is diﬀeomorphic to the limit domain N d / 2 in ( N , g ) . It follows that N = M and so g is an AH Einstein metric on M , with boundary metric γ . Combining the results above leads easily to the proof of Theorem A . Proof of Theorem A . Let γ i be a sequence of boundary metrics in C o , with γ i → γ ∈ C o in the C m , α ′ topology on ∂M , m ≥ 4 , with Π ( g i ) = [ γ i ] . Since only the conformal classes are uniquely determined , one may choose for instance γ i to be metrics of constant scalar curvature . To prove Π o is proper , one needs to show that { g i } has a convergent subsequence in E AH to a limit metric g ∈ E AH with Π [ g ] = [ γ ] . Suppose ﬁrst there is a constant s 0 > 0 such that s γ i ≥ s 0 . where s γ i is the ( intrinsic ) scalar curvature of the boundary metric γ i . It is then proved in [ 6 , Prop . 5 . 1 ] that ( 5 . 7 ) W id ¯ g i M ≤ √ 3 π / √ s 0 , cf . also ( A . 12 ) . Hence , in this case Theorem A follows directly from Theorem 5 . 2 . Next , suppose only s γ i ≥ 0 . If there is some constant D < ∞ such that W id ¯ g i M ≤ D , then again Theorem 5 . 2 proves the result . Suppose instead ( 5 . 8 ) W id ¯ g i M → ∞ . In this case , there is a rigidity result associated with the limiting case of ( 5 . 7 ) as s 0 → 0 , proved in [ 6 , Rmk . 5 . 2 , Lem . 5 . 5 ] . Namely , s γ i ≥ 0 and ( 5 . 8 ) imply that the sequence ( M , g i , x i ) , for x i as in ( 3 . 22 ) , converges in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology to a hyperbolic cusp metric ( 5 . 9 ) g C = dr 2 + r 2 g F , where g F is a ﬂat metric on ∂M . It follows from the proof of Theorem 5 . 2 , as following ( 5 . 5 ) , that γ = g F , so that , by deﬁnition , γ / ∈ C o . This implies that necessarily W id ¯ g i ≤ D , for some D < ∞ , which completes the proof . 31 Remark 5 . 3 . Theorem A implies that the space E oAH on a given 4 - manifold M satisfying ( 5 . 3 ) has only ﬁnitely many components whose conformal inﬁnities intersect any given compact set in C o . A similar result holds if the ﬁlling manifold M is also allowed to vary . Thus , there are only ﬁnitely many 4 - manifolds M i having a common boundary ∂M , which satisfy ( 5 . 3 ) and χ ( M i ) ≤ C , for some constant C < ∞ , for which ∩ i Π ( E oAH ( M i ) ) 6 = ∅ . The proof of this is exactly the same , using Theorem 3 . 5 and Remark 3 . 6 with varying manifolds M i . § 5 . 2 . In this section , we characterize the possible degenerations when Π is not proper . Observe ﬁrst that Theorem 5 . 2 implies that if the manifold M satisﬁes ( 5 . 3 ) , then the ”enhanced” boundary map ( 5 . 10 ) Ψ : E AH → Met ( ∂M ) × R , Ψ ( g ) = ( Π ( g ) , W id Π ( g ) M ) is proper . Thus , degenerations of AH Einstein metrics with controlled conformal inﬁnity can only occur when the width diverges to ∞ . On the other hand , as indicated in the Introduction , in general the boundary map Π is not proper . Deﬁne an AH Einstein metric with cusps ( N , g ) to be a complete Einstein metric g on a 4 - manifold N which has two types of ends , namely AH ends and cusp ends . A cusp end of ( N , g ) is an end E such that vol g E < ∞ . Thus , N has a compact ( possibly disconnected ) hypersurface H , disconnecting N into two non - compact connected components N = N 1 ∪ N 2 where ( N 1 , g ) is an AH Einstein metric with boundary H and ( N 2 , g ) has ﬁnite volume , so that each end of N 2 is a cusp end . A natural choice for H is the level set t − 1 ( 1 ) , where t is a geodesic deﬁning function for the conformally compact boundary ∂ AH N of N . Then N 1 = { x ∈ N : t ( x ) ≤ 1 } , N 2 = { x ∈ N : t ( x ) ≥ 1 } . Note that any cusp end E is not conformally compact . As one diverges to inﬁnity in E , the metric g is collapsing , in that vol g B x ( 1 ) → 0 as x → ∞ in E , and hence the injectivity radius satisﬁes inj g ( x ) → 0 , as x → ∞ in E , see § 3 . 1 . Theorem 5 . 4 . Let M be a 4 - manifold satisfying ( 1 . 4 ) , and let g i ∈ E AH be AH Einstein metrics with boundary metrics γ i ∈ C m , α , with γ i → γ in the C m , α ′ topology on ∂M , m ≥ 4 . Let t i be the geodesic deﬁning function associated with γ i and choose base points x i ∈ H i = t − 1 i ( 1 ) . Then a subsequence of { g i } converges , modulo diﬀeomorphisms in D 1 , either to an AH Einstein metric g on M , or to an AH Einstein metric with cusps ( N , g , x ) , x = lim x i . The convergence is smooth and uniform on compact subsets of M , N respectively . In both cases , the conformal inﬁnity is given by ( ∂M , [ γ ] ) . Further , the manifold N weakly embeds in M , as in ( 3 . 23 ) . Proof : For any D < ∞ , let ( M i ) D = { x ∈ ( M , g i ) : t i ( x ) ≤ D } , as in ( 5 . 5 ) . Theorem 5 . 2 implies that a subsequence of ( ( M i ) D , g i , x i ) converges smoothly to a limit AH Einstein metric g on a domain N D , with N D diﬀeomorphic to ( M i ) D , and with conformal inﬁnity of N D given by ( ∂M , [ γ ] ) . If there is a ﬁxed D < ∞ such that ( 5 . 4 ) holds , then the result follows from the proof of Theorem 5 . 2 or Theorem A . Thus , we may suppose ( 5 . 11 ) W id ¯ g i M → ∞ . In this case , it follows from [ 6 , Lemma 5 . 4 ] that there is a constant V 0 < ∞ , depending only on { γ i } and the Euler characteristic χ ( M ) , such that ( 5 . 12 ) vol g i ( M i ) 1 ≤ V 0 , 32 where ( M i ) 1 = { x ∈ ( M , g i ) : t i ( x ) ≥ 1 } is the complementary domain to ( M i ) 1 . ( The estimate ( 5 . 12 ) is a straightforward consequence of ( 2 . 18 ) , or more precisely the bound V ≤ 4 π 2 3 χ ( M ) , given uniform control of the metrics g i and ¯ g i on ( M i ) 1 ) . By Theorem 3 . 5 and Remark 3 . 6 , the pointed manifolds ( M , g i , x i ) , for x i base points in S i ( 1 ) = t − 1 i ( 1 ) , converge in a subsequence and in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology to a complete Einstein manifold ( N , g , x ) , x = lim x i . The convergence is also in the C ∞ topology , uniform on compact sets . The domain N 1 = { x ∈ ( N , g ) : t ( x ) ≥ 1 } , with t ( x ) = lim t i ( x ) , is the limit of the domains ( M i ) 1 . The bound ( 5 . 12 ) implies that N 1 is of ﬁnite volume while ( 5 . 11 ) implies that N 1 is non - compact . It follows that the full limit N = N 1 ∪ N 1 with limit metric g is a complete AH Einstein manifold with conformal inﬁnity ( ∂M , [ γ ] ) and with a non - empty collection of cusp ends . The fact that N weakly embeds in M follows exactly as in the proof of Theorem 3 . 7 . The fact that the AH cusp metric ( N , g ) has conformal inﬁnity ( ∂M , [ γ ] ) and that it weakly embeds in M implies that there is a sequence t j → ∞ such that N t j ⊂ N embeds in M , for N t j as above . Hence , for any j large , the manifold M may be decomposed as ( 5 . 13 ) M = N t j ∪ ( M \ N t j ) . With respect to a suitable diagonal subsequence j = j i , the metrics g i on M push the region M \ N t ji oﬀ to inﬁnity as i → ∞ and t j i → ∞ , giving rise to cusp ends in the limit ( N , g ) . Theorem 5 . 4 suggests the construction of a natural completion ¯ E AH of E AH . Thus , for any R < ∞ large , let C ( R ) denote the space of conformal classes [ γ ] on ∂M which contain a representative γ satisfying | | γ | | C 4 , α ≤ R , with respect to some ﬁxed coordinate system for ∂M . Let E AH ( R ) = Π − 1 ( R ) and for any g ∈ E AH ( R ) , choose a base point x ∈ t − 1 ( 1 ) ≡ H g , where t is the geodesic deﬁning function associated to the boundary metric γ . Then Theorem 5 . 4 implies that the completion ¯ E AH ( R ) of E AH ( R ) in the pointed Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology based at points x ∈ H g is the set of AH Einstein metrics on M , together with AH Einstein metrics with cusps ( N , g ) . If γ i are metrics in C ( R ) , then a subsequence of γ i converges in C m , α ′ to a limit metric γ ∈ C ( R ) . If g i ∈ E AH ( R ) satisfy Π ( g i ) = γ i , then the corresponding subsequence of g i converges in the Gromov - Hausdorﬀ topology based at x i to ( N , g ) ∈ ¯ E AH ( R ) , and the conformal inﬁnity of ( N , g ) is γ = lim γ i . The convergence is also in the C ∞ topology , uniform on compact sets . Of course one may have N = M , in which case the limit is an AH Einstein metric on M . For R < R ′ , E AH ( R ) ⊂ E AH ( R ′ ) and so we may form the union ¯ E AH = ∪ R ¯ E AH ( R ) with the induced topology . It is clear that in this topology , the boundary map Π extends to a continuous map ( 5 . 14 ) ¯Π : ¯ E AH → C . Further , the following corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 5 . 4 . Corollary 5 . 5 . Let M be a 4 - manifold satisfying ( 1 . 4 ) . Then the extended map ¯Π : ¯ E AH → C is proper . It follows in particular that the image ¯Π ( ¯ E AH ) ⊂ C is a closed subset of C . However , it is not known if ¯ E AH is a Banach manifold . Even if ¯ E AH is not a Banach manifold , it would be interesting to understand the ’size’ of the set of AH Einstein metrics 33 with cusps . The set of such metrics corresponds of course exactly to ∂ ¯ E AH = ¯ E AH \ E AH . In particular , with regard to the work to follow in § 6 - § 7 , one would like to know if the image ¯Π ( ∂ E AH ) disconnects C or not , cf . also Remark 7 . 8 below . Again the fact that ¯Π is proper implies that ¯Π ( ∂ E AH ) is a closed subset of C . Let ( 5 . 15 ) ˆ C = C \ ¯Π ( ∂ E AH ) ; this is the space of conformal classes on ∂M which are not the boundaries of AH Einstein metrics with cusps associated to the manifold M . Also let ˆ E AH = ¯Π − 1 ( ˆ C ) , so that ˆ E AH is the class of AH Einstein metrics on M whose conformal inﬁnity is not the conformal inﬁnity of any AH Einstein metric with cusps associated to M . If one gives ˆ C the relative topology , as a subset of C , then the following result is also an immediate consequence of the results above . Corollary 5 . 6 . Let M be a 4 - manifold satisfying ( 1 . 4 ) . Then the map ( 5 . 16 ) ˆ Π : ˆ E AH → ˆ C is proper . Remark 5 . 7 . The ﬁrst examples where Π is not proper , for example Π − 1 ( pt ) is non - compact in E AH , is the sequence of AH Einstein metrics g i on R 2 × T n − 1 , converging to the hyperbolic cusp metric on R × T n , discussed in Remark 2 . 6 ; cf . [ 6 , Prop . 4 . 4 ] for the explicit construction of { g i } . However , these metrics lie in distinct components of the moduli space E AH on R 2 × T 2 , and so cannot be connected by a curve of metrics on R 2 × T 2 . Thus E AH has inﬁnitely many components , and this is the cause of Π being non - proper . Currently , there are no known examples where Π restricted to a component of E AH is not proper . On the other hand , if one passes to the quotient of E AH by the full diﬀeomorphism group , then the metrics g i above may be joined by a curve . More recently , G . Craig [ 17 ] has constructed inﬁnite sequences of AH Einstein metrics ( M i , g i ) on non - diﬀeomorphic manifolds M i , which all have the same conformal inﬁnity ( ∂M , [ γ 0 ] ) . These limit on a complete hyperbolic manifold ( N , g − 1 ) , with conformal inﬁnity given by ( ∂M , [ γ 0 ] ) , but with additional cusp , i . e . parabolic , ends analogous to the hyperbolic cusp end above . In fact , the Einstein metrics are constructed by Dehn ﬁlling each cusp end of N . 6 . Degree of the Boundary Map . In this section , we prove that the boundary map Π o has a well - deﬁned Z - valued degree , following Smale [ 34 ] and White [ 37 ] , cf . also [ 34 ] . Throughout this section , we work componentwise on E oAH and C o , but we will not distinguish components with extra notation . Thus , we assume Π o : E oAH → C o where E oAH and C o are connected , that is connected components of the full spaces . The results of this section also hold for the restricted boundary map ˆΠ : ˆ E AH → ˆ C in ( 5 . 16 ) , but since there is no intrinsic characterization of ˆ C , we work with C o ; see also Remark 7 . 8 . Since Π o is a proper Fredholm map of index 0 , the Sard - Smale theorem [ 34 ] implies that the regular values of Π o are open and dense in C o . For γ a regular value , the ﬁber ( Π o ) − 1 ( γ ) thus consists of a ﬁnite number of points , i . e . ( equivalence classes of ) AH Einstein metrics on M . By [ 34 ] ( 6 . 1 ) deg 2 Π o = # ( Π o ) − 1 ( [ γ ] ) mod 2 , 34 is well - deﬁned , for any regular value [ γ ] in C o . We recall that if [ γ ] / ∈ ImΠ o , then [ γ ] is tautologically a regular value of Π o . Next , we show that Π o has a well - deﬁned degree in Z , essentially following [ 37 ] . Thus , for [ γ ] ∈ ImΠ o , let g be any AH Einstein metric on M , with Π o ( g ) = [ γ ] . Consider the linearization of the Einstein equations , i . e . as in ( 2 . 4 ) , the elliptic operator L = 12 D ∗ D − R , acting on L 2 , 2 ( M , g ) . The operator L is bounded below on L 2 , 2 and as in the theory of geodesics or minimal surfaces , let ( 6 . 2 ) ind g ∈ Z , be the L 2 index of the operator L at ( M , g ) , i . e . the maximal dimension of the subspace of L 2 , 2 ( M , g ) on which L is a negative deﬁnite bilinear form , with respect to the L 2 inner product . The nullity of ( M , g ) is the dimension of the L 2 kernel K . The main result of this section is the following : Theorem 6 . 1 . Let γ be a regular value of Π o on ( M , g ) and deﬁne ( 6 . 3 ) deg Π o = X g i ∈ ( Π o ) − 1 ( [ γ ] ) ( − 1 ) ind gi . Then deg Π o is well - deﬁned , i . e . independent of the choice of [ γ ] among regular values of Π o . Proof : In [ 37 ] , White presents general results guaranteeing the existence of a Z - valued degree , and we will show that the current situation is covered by these results . Thus , we refer to [ 37 ] for some further details . Let [ γ 1 ] and [ γ 2 ] be regular values of Π o and let [ ¯ σ ( t ) ] , t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] be an oriented curve in C o joining them . Choose representatives γ 1 ∈ [ γ 1 ] and γ 2 ∈ [ γ 2 ] and let ¯ σ ( t ) be a curve in Met ( ∂M ) joining γ 1 to γ 2 . By [ 34 ] , we may assume that ¯ σ is transverse to Π , so that the lift σ = Π − 1 ( ¯ σ ) is a collection of curves in E AH , with boundary in the ﬁbers over γ 1 and γ 2 . Deﬁne an orientation on σ by declaring that Π is orientation preserving at any regular point of σ which has even index , while Π is orientation reversing at regular points of σ of odd index . Thus , provided this orientation is well - deﬁned , the map Π | σ : σ → ¯ σ has a well - deﬁned mapping degree , as a map of 1 - manifolds . By construction , this 1 - dimensional degree is given by ( 6 . 3 ) at any regular point of σ and hence it follows that ( 6 . 3 ) is well - deﬁned . Thus , it suﬃces to prove that the orientation constructed above is well - deﬁned . If Π ∗ ( dσ / dt ) 6 = 0 for all t , so that all points of σ are regular , then the index of σ ( t ) is constant , and so there is nothing more to prove . Suppose instead that Π ∗ ( σ ′ ( t 0 ) ) = 0 , so that σ ( t 0 ) is a critical point of Π ; ( without loss of generality , from here on assume σ is connected ) . Hence σ ′ ( t 0 ) = κ 0 ∈ K , and for t near t 0 , σ ( t ) = σ ( t 0 ) + ( t − t 0 ) κ 0 + O ( ( t − t 0 ) 2 ) . Without loss of generality , ( cf . [ 37 ] ) , one may assume that K = h κ 0 i is the span of κ 0 . Thus , σ ( t ) may be viewed as a graph over K 0 . Let S m , α AH be the space of complete metrics g on M which have a C m , α conformal compactiﬁcation and which satisfy the slice condition β σ ( t 0 ) ( g ) = 0 . It is proved in [ 7 , Thm . 4 . 1 ] that the map ( 6 . 4 ) S m , α AH → S m − 2 , α , g → Ric g + 3 g , is a submersion at any g ∈ E m , α AH . Since Ric g + 3 g = 0 on the curve σ ( t ) , the implicit function theorem implies that there is a 2 - parameter family σ ( t , s ) ∈ S m , α AH , with Π ( σ ( t , s ) ) = Π ( σ ( t ) ) = γ ( t ) , for t near t 0 and s near 0 , such that ( 6 . 5 ) Ric σ ( t , s ) + 3 σ ( t , s ) ∈ K . 35 It is well - known that forms κ ∈ K satisfy | κ | = O ( t n ) , i . e . O ( t 3 ) in the case at hand , cf . [ 11 ] , [ 30 ] . This , together with the fact that such κ are transverse - traceless , ( cf . ( 2 . 6 ) ) , implies that the metrics σ ( t , s ) are Einstein to order 3 at conformal inﬁnity ∂M , in that dσds ∈ e T σ ( t , s ) E AH , cf . ( 2 . 20 ) . By Lemma 2 . 2 , the renormalized action I renEH is then well - deﬁned on the family σ ( t , s ) . When viewed as a function of t , s , one has ( 6 . 6 ) d dsI renEH ( σ ( t , s ) ) = Z M h Ric σ ( t , s ) + 3 σ ( t , s ) , dσ ds i dV , since dσ / ds has 0 boundary values on ∂M . ( The Euler - Lagrange equations for I renEH are the same as those for the usual Einstein - Hilbert action ) . By ( 2 . 6 ) and ( 6 . 5 ) , d ds ( Ric σ ( t , s ) + 3 σ ( t , s ) ) = L ( dσ ( t , s ) ds ) ∈ K , which implies that dds σ ( t , s ) ∈ K . From this , it follows that the integral in ( 6 . 6 ) vanishes only on the curve σ ( t ) ; thus the curve σ ( t ) in the plane P spanned by t , s is the set where dI renEH / ds = 0 . ( The functional I ren EH plays the role of g in [ 37 ] ) . It follows that σ ( t ) is ( locally ) the boundary of the open set { dI ren EH / ds > 0 } in P : ( 6 . 7 ) σ ( t ) = ∂ { dI renEH / ds > 0 } . If ind σ ( t ) is even , for t near t 0 , t 6 = t 0 , give σ ( t ) the boundary orientation induced by this open domain , while if ind σ ( t ) is odd for t near t 0 , t 6 = t 0 , give σ ( t ) the reverse orientation . It is now straightforward to see that this deﬁnition coincides with the orientation deﬁned at the beginning of the proof . Thus , the point t 0 → σ ( t 0 ) is a critical point for the map π 1 ◦ σ , where π 1 : ( t , s ) → t is projection onto the ﬁrst factor . If this critical point is a folding singularity for π 1 ◦ σ , then the index of σ ( t ) changes by 1 in passing through σ ( t 0 ) and reverses the orientation of λ ( t ) = π 1 ( σ ( t ) ) , ( exactly as is the case with the standard folding singularity x → x 2 ) . On the other hand , if π 1 ◦ σ does not fold with respect to π 1 , ( so that one has an inﬂection point ) , then the index of σ ( t ) does not change through t 0 and π 1 maps σ ( t ) to λ ( t ) in an orientation preserving way . We refer to [ 37 ] for further details , and also to § 7 for concrete examples of such folding behavior . Remark 6 . 2 . As discussed in § 2 , the inclusion E ( m ′ , α ′ ) AH ⊂ E ( m , α ) AH , is dense , for any ( m ′ , α ′ ) ≥ ( m , α ) and these spaces are diﬀeomorphic . Hence , the degree of Π o is independent of ( m , α ) and deﬁned on the spaces E ( m , α ) AH for all m ≥ 4 . Moreover , the degree is also deﬁned on the spaces ¯ E AH and ˆ E AH in ( 5 . 14 ) and ( 5 . 16 ) , and is independent of ( m , α ) . 7 . Computations of the Degree . We conclude the paper with computations of deg Π o for several interesting examples of 4 - manifolds . In all cases , the evaluation of the degree is made possible by symmetry arguments , using Theorem 2 . 5 . Recall that if deg Π o 6 = 0 , then Π is surjective onto C o , and so any conformal class [ γ ] in C o on ∂M has a ﬁlling by an AH Einstein metric g with conformal inﬁnity [ γ ] . Of course , deg Π o = 0 does not imply that Π cannot be surjective . We begin with the proof of Theorem B . Proof of Theorem B . As seed metric , choose the hyperbolic ( Poincar´e ) metric g 0 on B 4 . This has conformal inﬁnity [ γ 0 ] , where γ 0 is the round metric on S 3 = ∂B 4 . Now the boundary metric γ 0 admits a large connected group SO ( 4 ) of isometries . Theorem 2 . 5 implies that for any AH Einstein metric g on 36 B 4 , SO ( 4 ) acts eﬀectively by isometries on ( B 4 , g ) . It is then standard that g must be the Poincar´e metric on B 4 . It follows that up to isometry , g 0 is the unique metric with conformal inﬁnity [ γ 0 ] . ( This also follows from a rigidity theorem in [ 9 , Thm . 5 . 2 ] ) . Further , it is well - known that the L 2 kernel K of g 0 is trivial , i . e . K = { 0 } ; in fact , this holds for any Einstein metric of negative sectional curvature , cf . [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] . Thus , g 0 is a regular point of Π and since Π − 1 [ γ 0 ] = g 0 , the point [ γ 0 ] is a regular value of Π . The result then follows from ( 6 . 3 ) . We point out the following immediate consequence of the proof . Corollary 7 . 1 . Let M be any 4 - manifold satisfying π 1 ( M , ∂M ) = 0 , and ( 1 . 4 ) , with ∂M = S 3 and M 6 = B 4 . Then on any component of E oAH , ( 7 . 1 ) deg Π o = 0 , and Π is not surjective . In fact the conformal class of the round metric γ 0 on S 3 is not in Im Π . Proof : Suppose the class [ γ 0 ] ∈ ImΠ , so that there is an AH Einstein metric g on M , with boundary metric γ 0 . The proof of Theorem B above implies that necessarily g = g 0 , where g 0 is the Poincar´e metric on B 4 . Hence , M = B 4 , a contradiction . Next , we have : Proposition 7 . 2 . Let M = R 2 × S 2 , so that ∂M = S 1 × S 2 . Then ( 7 . 2 ) deg Π o = 0 , and Π is not surjective . Proof : As seed metric ( s ) in this case , we take the remarkable 1 - parameter family of AdS Schwarz - schild metrics , discussed in detail in [ 23 ] , cf . also [ 38 ] . Thus , on R 2 × S 2 , consider the metric ( 7 . 3 ) g m = F − 1 dr 2 + F dθ 2 + r 2 g S 2 ( 1 ) , where F = F ( r ) = 1 + r 2 − 2 mr . The mass parameter m > 0 and r ∈ [ r + , ∞ ) , where r + is the largest root of the equation F ( r + ) = 0 . The locus { r + = 0 } is a totally geodesic round 2 - sphere S 2 , of radius r + . Smoothness of the metric at { r + = 0 } requires that the circle parameter θ run over the interval [ 0 , β ) , where β is given by ( 7 . 4 ) β = 4 πr + 1 + 3 r 2 + . It is easily seen that as m varies from 0 to ∞ , r + varies monotonically from 0 to ∞ . The metrics g m are isometrically distinct , for distinct values of m , and form a smooth curve in E AH , with conformal inﬁnity given by the conformal class of the product metric γ m = S 1 ( β ) × S 2 ( 1 ) . Notice however that the length β has a maximum value as m ranges over ( 0 , ∞ ) , namely ( 7 . 5 ) β ≤ β max = 2 π / √ 3 , achieved at r + = 1 / √ 3 , m = m 0 = 2 / √ 3 . As m → 0 or m → ∞ , one has β → 0 . Thus , the boundary map Π on the curve g m is a fold map , folding the ray m ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) onto the β - interval ( 0 , β max ] . The map Π restricted to the curve g m is a 2 - 1 map , except at the point g m 0 . The metric g m 0 is a critical point of Π , and , ( as will be seen below ) , the tangent vector ( dg m / dm ) m = m 0 spans the L 2 kernel K g m 0 . Next , we claim that the metrics g m are the only AH Einstein metrics on R 2 × S 2 with conformal inﬁnity given by a product γ L = S 1 ( L ) × S 2 ( 1 ) . The isometry group of γ L contains G = SO ( 2 ) × SU ( 2 ) and by Theorem 2 . 5 , any AH Einstein metric g L on M with boundary metric γ L has G 37 acting eﬀectively by isometries . As in ( 2 . 7 ) , we may choose a geodesic deﬁning function for g L so that g L has the form g L = ds 2 + g s , where g s is a curve of metrics on S 1 × S 2 invariant under the G - action . Thus , the Einstein metric g L has cohomogeneity 1 . It then follows from the classiﬁcation given in [ 31 ] for instance that the metric g L on R 2 × S 2 is isometric to g m , for some m = m ( L ) . A similar argument shows that the metrics g m , for m 6 = m 0 are regular points of Π . For suppose there exists κ ∈ K = K g m . Then κ is the tangent vector to a curve σ ( s ) ∈ E AH with σ ( 0 ) = g m and Π ∗ ( κ ) = 0 , so that the boundary metric of σ ( s ) is ﬁxed to ﬁrst order in s . The proof of Theorem 2 . 5 in [ 8 ] then shows that κ inherits the symmetries of g m , i . e . κ is G - invariant . Hence , κ is tangent to the curve g m , so that , without loss of generality , σ ( s ) = g m ( s ) . Since Π ∗ ( ddm g m ) 6 = 0 , when m 6 = m 0 , this proves the claim . We may thus compute deg Π o by evaluating the formula ( 6 . 3 ) on a pair of distinct metrics g m 1 and g m 2 with Π ( g m 1 ) = Π ( g m 2 ) . From [ 23 , § 3 ] , one has ( 7 . 6 ) ind g m 1 = + 1 , ind g m 2 = 0 , for m 1 < m 0 < m 2 , which proves ( 7 . 2 ) . Alternately , since Π is a 2 - 1 fold map on g m , the proof of Theorem 7 . 1 shows directly that ( 7 . 2 ) holds . Further , the symmetry argument above implies that the metrics S 1 ( L ) × S 2 ( 1 ) are not in ImΠ , whenever ( 7 . 7 ) L > β max , and hence Π is not surjective . This result should be compared with the following : Proposition 7 . 3 . Let M = S 1 × R 3 , so that ∂M = S 1 × S 2 . Then ( 7 . 8 ) deg Π o = 1 , and Π o is surjective . Proof : As seed metrics in this situation , we take a family of hyperbolic metrics , namely the metrics H 4 ( − 1 ) / Z , where the Z - quotient is obtained by a hyperbolic or loxodromic translation of length L along a geodesic in H 4 ( − 1 ) . The conformal inﬁnity is the product metric S 1 ( L ) × S 2 ( 1 ) in the case of a hyperbolic translation , and the bent product metric S 1 ( L ) × α S 2 ( 1 ) on the same space when the translation is loxodromic ; the angle α between the factors S 1 ( L ) and S 2 ( 1 ) corresponds to the loxodromic rotation . As in Proposition 7 . 2 , any AH Einstein metric on S 1 × R 3 with boundary metric S 1 ( L ) × S 2 ( 1 ) has SO ( 2 ) × SO ( 3 ) acting eﬀectively by isometries . Again , the classiﬁcation in [ 31 ] implies that , on this manifold , the only such metrics are hyperbolic . Hence the result follows as in the proof of Theorem B . Next , we turn to non - trivial disc bundles over S 2 . For the disc bundle of degree 1 over S 2 , i . e . M = CP 2 \ B 4 , with ∂M = S 3 , Corollary 7 . 1 implies that Π is not surjective so that ( 7 . 9 ) deg Π o = 0 . Remark 7 . 4 . Actually , to justify this statement one needs to remove the hypothesis ( 1 . 4 ) , since in this situation H 2 ( ∂M ) does not surject onto H 2 ( ¯ M ) . Recall that ( 1 . 4 ) was only used to rule out orbifold degenerations in the proof of Theorem 3 . 7 . However , it is sometimes possible to rule out orbifold degenerations in the case of suﬃciently low Euler characteristic directly , without the use of ( 1 . 4 ) . This situation was treated in [ 1 ] in the case of orbifold degenerations on compact manifolds , and the argument for AH metrics is similar ; thus we refer to [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] for some further details . 38 Let M be the disc bundle of degree k over S 2 , so that χ ( M ) = 2 , and let { g i } be a sequence of AH Einstein metrics on M which converge to an AH Einstein orbifold ( X , g ) , with boundary metrics γ i converging in C m , α to the boundary metric γ for ( X , g ) . By ( 2 . 18 ) , one has 1 8 π 2 Z M | W g i | 2 = 2 − 3 4 π 2 V ( g i ) . The results of Theorem 3 . 7 , Corollary 4 . 10 and Proposition 5 . 1 show that V ( g i ) → V ( g ) , where V ( g ) is the renormalized volume of the Einstein orbifold ( X , g ) . Now as discussed following Proposition 3 . 10 , orbifold singularities arise by crushing essential 2 - cycles in M to points . Since M has only one essential 2 - cycle , ( up to multiplicity ) , given by the zero - section , there can only be one singular point on X . For the same reason , there is only one Ricci - ﬂat ALE space ( E , g ∞ ) associated to the singularity . It is then easy to see , cf . [ 1 , § 6 ] , [ 3 , § 3 . 3 ] and references therein , that lim i →∞ Z M | W g i | 2 = Z X | W g | 2 + Z E | W g ∞ | 2 . The formula ( 2 . 18 ) for Einstein orbifolds ( X , g ) gives 1 8 π 2 Z X | W g | 2 = χ ( X 0 ) + 1 | Γ 0 | − 3 4 π 2 V ( g ) , where X 0 is the regular set of X and the orbifold singularity of X is C ( S 3 / Γ 0 ) , ( cf . [ 1 , ( 6 . 2 ) ] ) . Also Z E | W g ∞ | 2 = χ ( E ) − 1 | Γ | , where E is asymptotic to C ( S 3 / Γ ) at inﬁnity , ( cf . [ 1 , ( 6 . 3 ) ] ) . Combining these equations gives Γ 0 = Γ = Z k , and hence χ ( X 0 ) = 0 , so that E is diﬀeomorphic to M . In particular , this rules out orbifold degenerations in the case k = 1 , where M = CP 2 \ B 4 , since Γ must be non - trivial , Γ 6 = { e } . This gives ( 7 . 9 ) . For general k , one thus has ( 7 . 10 ) Z E | W g ∞ | 2 = 2 − 1 k . On the other hand , the signature formula for ALE metrics , cf . [ 27 ] for instance , gives ( 7 . 11 ) τ ( E ) = 1 12 π 2 Z E | W + | 2 − | W − | 2 + η ( S 3 / Z k ) , and η ( S 3 / Z k ) = ( k − 1 ) ( k − 2 ) 3 k . Since τ ( E ) = 1 , simple arithmetic as in the Hitchin - Thorpe inequality gives the estimate ( 7 . 12 ) 4 k − 2 ≥ | 3 k − ( k − 1 ) ( k − 2 ) | . The estimate ( 7 . 12 ) implies k ≤ 9 , so that orbifold degenerations are not possible if k ≥ 10 . We conjecture that there are in fact no orbifold degenerations for k ≥ 3 . However , for k = 2 , it will be seen below that there are orbifold degenerations . In fact , in this case , ( 7 . 12 ) shows that ( E , g ∞ ) must be self - dual , and hence by Kronheimer’s classiﬁcation [ 29 ] , ( E , g ∞ ) is the Eguchi - Hanson metric . Example 7 . 5 . It is interesting to compare the result ( 7 . 9 ) with an explicit family of AH Einstein metrics on M = CP 2 \ B 4 , namely the AdS Taub - Bolt family , cf . [ 24 ] , [ 31 ] . This is a 1 - parameter family of metrics given by ( 7 . 13 ) g s = E s { ( r 2 − 1 ) F − 1 ( r ) dr 2 + ( r 2 − 1 ) − 1 F ( r ) ( dτ + cos θdφ ) 2 + ( r 2 − 1 ) g S 2 ( 12 ) } , 39 where the parameters r , s satisfy r ≥ s and s > 2 , the constant E s is given by ( 7 . 14 ) E s = 2 3 s − 2 s 2 − 1 , and the function F ( r ) = F s ( r ) is ( 7 . 15 ) F s ( r ) = Er 4 + ( 4 − 6 E ) r 2 + { − Es 3 + ( 6 E − 4 ) s + 1 s ( 3 E − 4 ) } r + ( 4 − 3 E ) . The parameter τ runs over the vertical S 1 , and τ ∈ [ 0 , β ) , with ( 7 . 16 ) β = 2 π . The bolt S 2 { r = s } is a round , totally geodesic 2 - sphere , of area A s = 23 π ( s − 2 ) . These metrics are AH , with conformal inﬁnity given by a Berger ( or squashed ) S 3 , with base S 2 ( 12 ) , and Hopf ﬁber S 1 = S 1 ( L ) of length L = 2 π √ E . In analogy to ( 7 . 4 ) - ( 7 . 5 ) , notice that E → 0 as s → 2 or s → ∞ , and has a maximal value E max = ( 2 − √ 3 ) / 3 at s = s 0 = 2 + √ 3 . Note in particular that since E max < 1 , the round metric S 3 ( 1 ) is not in Im Π ( g s ) for any s . We see that on the curve g s , s ∈ ( 2 , ∞ ) , the boundary map Π has exactly the same 2 - 1 fold behavior as for the AdS Schwarzschild metric . The use of Theorem 2 . 5 as in Proposition 7 . 2 implies that Π is not surjective , and in fact the Berger spheres with Hopf ﬁber length L , for L > 2 π √ E max are not in ImΠ . In contrast , one has the following behavior on more twisted disc bundles over S 2 . Proposition 7 . 6 . Let M = M k be the disc bundle of degree k over S 2 , k ≥ 10 , so that ∂M = S 3 / Z k . Then ( 7 . 17 ) deg Π o = 1 , and Π o is surjective . Proof : As seed metrics , choose again the AdS - Taub bolt metrics on M k , cf . [ 24 ] , [ 31 ] . These have exactly the same form as ( 7 . 13 ) - ( 7 . 16 ) , except that the parameter s satisﬁes s > 1 , E s in ( 7 . 14 ) is replaced by E s , k of the form ( 7 . 18 ) E s , k = 2 ks − 4 3 ( s 2 − 1 ) , and the period β for τ is given by β = 2 π / k . For each k , these metrics are AH , and the conformal inﬁnity on S 3 / Z k is given by the Berger metric , with , as before , Hopf circle ﬁbers of length L = 2 π p E s , k / k . When E = 1 , conformal inﬁnity is given by the round metric on S 3 / Z k . Note however from ( 7 . 18 ) that now the function E s , k is a monotone decreasing function of s , as s increases from 1 to ∞ . Hence , Π is 1 - 1 on this curve , and in particular , the metric g s 0 , s 0 = 13 ( k + √ k 2 − 3 ) has conformal inﬁnity the constant curvature metric on S 3 / Z k . The symmetry argument using Theorem 2 . 5 as before , together with [ 31 ] , implies these metrics are the unique metrics with these boundary values . The metrics g s are regular points for Π , and so ( 7 . 17 ) follows , since by Remark 7 . 4 , orbifold singularities cannot occur when k ≥ 10 . Remark 7 . 7 . We expect Proposition 7 . 6 holds for all k ≥ 3 ; the proof above holds for such k , provided there are no orbifold degenerations , cf . Remark 7 . 4 . However , Proposition 7 . 6 does not hold when k = 2 . In this case , ( 7 . 18 ) becomes ( 7 . 19 ) E s , 2 = 4 3 1 s + 1 . 40 This is of course monotone decreasing in s ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ) , but it has a ﬁnite value at s = 1 with E 1 , 2 = 23 . As s → 1 , the area of the bolt S 2 at { r = s } tends to 0 , and vanishes at { r = 1 } when s = 1 . Thus , the Taub - Bolt metric is an orbifold singular metric on C ( RP 3 ) when s = 1 . Note this shows that the k = 2 discussion in Remark 7 . 4 is sharp , in that as s → 1 on the Taub - Bolt curve , the Ricci - ﬂat ALE space associated to the orbifold singularity is necessarily the Eguchi - Hanson metric . In particular , only the values E ∈ ( 0 , 23 ) are achieved on the Taub - Bolt curve g s . I am grateful to Michael Singer for pointing out this behavior of the Taub - NUT curve . Hence the round metric γ 0 on RP 3 is not in Im Π on the curve g s . Again , Theorem 2 . 5 and the classiﬁcation in [ 31 ] show that γ 0 / ∈ Π ( E ) , where E is the moduli space of AH Einstein metrics on the disc bundle of degree 2 over S 2 . Remark 7 . 8 . We close the paper with some observations on whether the full boundary map Π : E AH → C might be surjective , or almost surjective , at least when deg Π o 6 = 0 . First , recall from Corollaries 5 . 5 and 5 . 6 that both the extended map ¯Π : ¯ E AH → C and the restricted map ˆ Π : ˆ E AH → ˆ C are proper . In this regard , it would be very interesting to know if the set of boundary values of AH Einstein metrics with cusps disconnects C or not , that is whether ¯Π ( ∂ ¯ E AH ) ⊂ C disconnects C , or whether ˆ C = C \ ¯Π ( ∂ ¯ E AH ) is path connected , ( for instance if ¯Π ( ∂ ¯ E AH ) is of codimension at least 2 ) . If ˆ C is path connected , then the degree theory arguments of § 6 and § 7 hold without any change and give a well - deﬁned degree deg Π on each component of E AH . In particular , if this holds and deg Π 6 = 0 , then Π is almost surjective , in that Π surjects onto ˆ C . On the other hand , if ¯Π ( ∂ ¯ E AH ) disconnects C , then ¯Π ( ∂ ¯ E AH ) represents a “wall” , past which it may not be possible to ﬁll in boundary metrics with AH Einstein metrics . This would be the case for instance if ¯ E AH is a Banach manifold with boundary ∂ ¯ E AH and ¯Π maps ∂ ¯ E AH onto a set of codimension 1 in C . The same issue arises if the condition ( 1 . 4 ) does not hold , so that orbifold singular metrics might arise , as discussed in Remark 7 . 7 . Finally , it would also be interesting to know if there are topological obstructions to the possible formation of cusps , as is the case with the formation of orbifold singularities as in ( 1 . 4 ) . Thus , with respect to the decomposition ( 5 . 13 ) , one would like to know for instance if some of the homology of one of the two factors injects into that of the union M . Appendix In this appendix , we collect several formulas for the curvature of conformal compactiﬁcations of AH Einstein metrics . Let ¯ g = ρ 2 · g , where ρ is a deﬁning function with respect to ¯ g . The curvatures of the metrics g and ¯ g are related by the following formulas : ( A . 1 ) ¯ K ab = K ab + | ¯ ∇ ρ | 2 ρ 2 − 1 ρ { ¯ D 2 ρ ( ¯ e a , ¯ e a ) + ¯ D 2 ρ ( ¯ e b , ¯ e b ) } . ( A . 2 ) ¯ Ric = − ( n − 1 ) ¯ D 2 ρ ρ + ( nρ − 2 ( | ¯ ∇ ρ | 2 − 1 ) − ¯∆ ρ ρ ) ¯ g , ( A . 3 ) ¯ s = − 2 n ¯∆ ρ ρ + n ( n + 1 ) ρ − 2 ( | ¯ ∇ ρ | 2 − 1 ) . 41 The equation ( A . 2 ) is equivalent to the Einstein equation ( 1 . 2 ) . Observe that ( A . 2 ) implies that if the compactiﬁcation ¯ g is C 2 , then ( A . 4 ) | ¯ ∇ ρ | → 1 at ∂M , and so by ( A . 1 ) , | K ab + 1 | = O ( ρ 2 ) . For r = − log ρ , a simple calculation gives ( A . 5 ) | ¯ ∇ ρ | = | ∇ r | , where the norm and gradient on the left are with respect to ¯ g , and on the right are with respect to g . A deﬁning function ρ = t is a geodesic deﬁning function if ( A . 6 ) | ¯ ∇ t | = 1 , in a collar neighborhood U of ∂M . Clearly , the formulas ( A . 1 ) - ( A . 3 ) simplify considerably in this situation . The function t is the distance function to ∂M on ( M , ¯ g ) , and similarly by ( A . 5 ) , the function r is a ( signed ) distance function on ( M , g ) . The integral curves of ¯ ∇ t and ∇ r are geodesics in ( M , ¯ g ) and ( M , g ) respectively . The 2 nd fundamental form ¯ A of the level sets S ( t ) of t in ( M , ¯ g ) is given by ¯ A = D 2 t , with ¯ H = ¯∆ t giving the mean curvature of S ( t ) . Along t - geodesics of ( M , ¯ g ) , one has the standard Riccati equation ( A . 7 ) ¯ H ′ + | ¯ A | 2 + ¯ Ric ( ¯ ∇ t , ¯ ∇ t ) = 0 , where ¯ H ′ = d ¯ H / dt . The following formulas relating the curvatures of ( M , ¯ g ) at ∂M to the intrinsic curvatures of ( ∂M , γ ) may be found in [ 6 , § 1 ] . Let ¯ g be a C 2 geodesic compactiﬁcation of ( M , g ) , with C 2 boundary metric γ . Then at ∂M , ( A . 8 ) ¯ s = 2 n ¯ Ric ( N , N ) = n n − 1 s γ , where N = ¯ ∇ t is the unit normal to ∂M with respect to ¯ g . If X is tangent to ∂M , then ( A . 9 ) ¯ Ric ( N , X ) = 0 , while if T denotes the projection onto T ( ∂M ) , then ( A . 10 ) ( ¯ Ric ) T = 1 n − 2 ( ( n − 1 ) Ric γ − s γ 2 ( n − 1 ) γ ) . In particular , the full curvature of ambient metric ¯ g at ∂M is determined by the curvature of the boundary metric γ . Finally , we have the following formula for ¯ s ′ = d ¯ s / dt : ( A . 11 ) ¯ s ′ = 2 nt − 1 | ¯ D 2 t | 2 ≥ 1 2 n 2 t ¯ s 2 ≥ 0 . Hence , if ¯ s ( 0 ) > 0 , then ( A . 12 ) t 2 < 4 n 2 / ¯ s ( 0 ) .
