Clathrin heavy chain - deficient mutants ( chcl ) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are viable but ex - hibit compromised growth rates . To investigate the role of clathrin in intercompartmental protein transport , two pathways have been monitored in chcl cells : trans - port of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins to the vacuole and receptor - mediated uptake of mating phero - mone . Newly synthesized precursors of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) were converted to mature CPY with similar kinetics in mutant and wild - type cells , chcl cells did not aberrantly secrete CPY and immunolocalization techniques revealed most of the CPY in chcl cells within morphologically identifi - able vacuolar structures . Receptor - mediated internali - zation of the mating pheromone a - factor occurred in chcl cells at 36 - 50 % wild - type levels . The mutant cells were fully competent to respond to pheromone - induced cell - cycle arrest . These results ar - gue that in yeast , clathrin may not play an essential role either in vacuolar protein sorting and delivery or in receptor - mediated endocytosis of a - factor . Alterna - tive mechanisms ordinarily may execute these pathways , or be activated in clathrin - deficient cells . least two avenues of intracellular protein traffic ser - vice lysosomes in mammalian cells and lysosome - like vacuoles in yeast . Newly synthesized lysosomal and vacuolar enzymes follow the secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi body ( 11 , 39 ) . After traversing Golgi body cisternae , the enzymes are diverted from the secretory pathway at an undefined location and de - livered to their final residence . One branch of the endocytic pathway also leads to lysosomes ( or vacuoles ) . In mam - malian cells , both fluid - phase and receptor - mediated en - docytosis involve transfer of extracellular molecules to an en - dosomal compartment ( 19 ) . Endosomal sorting reactions direct traffic between several pathways , one of which leads to lysosomes . Although not as extensively characterized in yeast , both fluid - phase and receptor - mediated internaliza - tion have been described ( 7 , 22 , 36 ) . Transfer of molecules between compartments along both lysosome - oriented routes is thought to be mediated by trans - port vesicles ( 11 , 19 ) . Clathrin - coated membranes and vesi - cles have been implicated as key intermediates in the forma - tion of these transport vesicles ( 15 , 35 ) . The most compelling example of an association between clathrin and transport vesicle generation has been provided by studies of receptor - mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells ( 15 , 16 ) . Initially , receptor - bound ligands are concentrated along indented do - G . S .

The predominant component of the lattice is clathrin . Clathrin - coated pits invaginate and bud , forming clathrin - coated vesi - cles laden with receptors and associated ligands . Vesicles quickly shed their coat before fusion with the subsequent endocytic compartment . Less extensive biochemical and morphological evidence has been garnered in support of a similar role for clathrin during vesicle generation in other in - tercompartmental transport pathways , including the route fol - lowed by newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes ( 3 , 4 , 12 , 34 ) . In vitro , clathrin exhibits properties that are uniquely suited for participation in membrane vesiculation . The poly - hedral lattice on purified clathrin - coated vesicles can be depolymerized to yield " triskelions " composed of three clath - rin heavy chains ( each 180 kD ) and three clathrin light chains ( usually two species varying in size from 30 - 40 kD ) ( 26 , 47 ) . Triskelions can assemble to form empty lattice cages ( 26 ) or rebind to vesicles previously stripped of their clathrin coats ( 46 ) . From these studies , a model emerged which suggested that polymerization of clathrin triskelions into polyhedral cages drives formation of coated vesicles from coated membrane regions ( 17 , 35 ) . In addition , specific interactions between the clathrin coats , or an associated protein , and membrane proteins and receptors carrying ligands could insure collec - tion of cargo proteins at membrane sites engaged in vesicle formation ( 16 , 31 , 35 ) . In this view , clathrin plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis and selectivity of transport vesicles . © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 88 / 05 / 1453 / 9 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 106 , May 1988 1453 - 1461 1453 Table I .

In earlier reports we have described the generation of clathrin heavy chain - deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( 32 , 33 ) . Yeast strains harboring null alleles of the single clathrin heavy chain gene ( CHC1 ) are viable but ex - hibit reduced growth rates . Viable cells devoid of clathrin - coated vesicles provide a means to determine whether clath - rin is required for various intracellular transport reactions . Such a direct test of biological function has not been avail - able previously . Here we investigate the integrity of two transport pathways in clathrin - deficient ceils : transfer of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins to the vacuole and receptor - mediated internalization of peptide mating pheromone . Materials and Methods Strains , Media , and Genetic Methods Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I . YPD is YP medium ( 1 % Bacto - Yeast extract , 2 % Bactopeptone ; Difco Laboratories , Inc . , De - troit , MI ) with 2 % glucose . Solid YPD medium contained 2 % agar . For assso42 - - labeling , cells were grown in Wickerham ' s minimal medium ( 51 ) except sulfate salts were replaced by chloride salts and ammonium sul - fate was added to the desired concentration . The absorbance of dilute cell suspensions was measured in a 1 - cm cuvette at 600 nm in a Zeiss PMQII spectrophotometer . Standard genetic methods were used for CHC1 strain constructions ( 42 ) . chcl : : LEU2 and pep4 : : URA3 strains were generated by single step gene transplacement as described elsewhere ( 33 ) . Plasmid pTSI5 used to disrupt PEP4 is reported in Rothman et al . ( 38 ) . Radiolabeling , Preparation of Lysates , and Immunoprecipitations Cells were grown overnight to midlogarithmic phase at 30°C in minimal medium plus 2 % glucose and 200 I . tM ammonium sulfate . For labeling , cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed , and resuspended at 2 OD600 per ml in minimal medium plus 2 % glucose without ammonium sulfate . Labeling was initiated by adding 200 IxCi of 35SSO42 - - ( 1 , 200 Ci / mmol ; ICN Blochemicals , Inc . , Irvine , CA ) per OD600 . After labeling at 30°C , ammonium sulfate ( 3 mM ) , cysteine ( 0 . 01 % ) , and methionine ( 0 . 01 % ) were added . To detect internal carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) ~ , samples were collected at designated time intervals , placed on ice , and sodium azide added to 10 mM . Upon completion of the time course , cells were lysed by agitation with glass beads and SDS as described ( 33 ) . To measure both in - ternal and secreted CPY , after labeling , cells were mixed with an equal vol - ume of minimal medium with 2 % glucose , 500 I . tg / ml ovalbumin or BSA and ammonium sulfate , cysteine , and methionine at concentrations cited above . Ovalbumin and BSA stabilize secreted CPY ( 45 ) . At each time point , cells were collected by centrifugation , the medium removed , 10 mM sodium 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : CPY , carboxypeptidase Y ; YPD , YP medium ( 1 % Bacto - Yeast extract , 2 % Bactopeptone ) ; TAME , p - tosyl - L - arginine methyl ester . azide added to the cell pellet , and both fractions placed on ice . Cell lysates were prepared as described above . Medium fractions received SDS to a final concentration of 0 . 8 % . All samples were heated at 100°C for 3 min , then adjusted to final concentrations of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 2 , 135 mM sodium chloride , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 4 % SDS . Immunoprecipita - tion techniques and SDS - PAGE analysis are described in Stevens et al . ( 45 ) . Densitometry has been previously reported ( 33 ) . Each form of CPY in Fig . 2 is expressed as the percentage of the total density value of all three forms at the time point . The total values varied up to 20 % between time points . a - Factor Uptake and Binding Assays 35S - labeled a - factor was prepared and purified as described by Chvatchko et al . ( 7 ) . The specific activity of the purified peptide was ' ~ 1 Ci / mmol as determined by halo assay . Thin layer chromatography revealed two spots in accordance with results reported by Chvatchko et al . ( 7 ) . For uptake determinations we applied a modification of the assay used by Chvatchko et al . ( 7 ) . Cells were grown overnight in YPD to an ODt , 00 of " , , 1 , then washed , and resuspended at 30 OD600 / ml in pH 5 . 5 YP plus 5 . 0 % glucose , 5 mM p - tosyl - L - arginine methyl ester ( TAME ) , and 0 . 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) . 35S - labeled a - factor was added to a final concentration of 10 - s M and the cultures incubated with shaking at 24°C . At time intervals , 100 I . tl samples were removed and diluted into 2 ml of ice - cold 50 mM sodium citrate , pH 2 . After 20 rain on ice , cells were collected on glass fiber filters ( GFC Whatman , Inc . , Clifton , NJ ) and washed with 20 ml of the citrate buffer . Filters were dried and counted in a liquid scintillation counter for l0 min with Beta - Max scintillant ( West Chem , San Diego , CA ) . 200 OD ~ 0 / ml of strain GPY74 - 29B internalized 63 % of l0 - 8 M a - factor in 75 min at 24°C . This value was taken as the percentage of ass - labeled peptide that was biologically active . In several experiments , replacement assays were conducted on 20 - min time point samples to deter - mine the amount of biologically active a - factor remaining in the medium . Cells were removed by centrifugation and GPY74 - 29B cells added to 200 OD600 / ml and incubated at 24°C for 75 min . In each case ( CHC1 MATa , chcl MATa , and chcl MATa strains ) , the sum of the counts internalized by cells in the first 20 - min incubation and GPY74 - 29B cells in the replacement incubation corresponded to the amount of biologically active 35S - labeled a - factor added at the onset . For a - factor cell surface binding measurements , cells grown as described above were resuspended at various concentrations in pH 5 . 5 YP medium plus 10 mM potassium fluoride , 10 mM sodium azide , 5 mM TAME , and 0 . 2 mM PMSF ( inhibitor medium ) . 35S - labeled a - factor was added to 10 - s M and the samples incubated with shaking at 24°C . After 25 min , samples were diluted into 2 - ml inhibitor medium , collected onto glass fiber filters , and washed three times with 2 ml inhibitor medium . Filters were dried and counted as above . Halo Assays a - Factor was purified from the medium of MATa cells through the Bio - Rex 70 ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) column step described in Ciejek and Thorner ( 8 ) . For halo assays , cells were grown overnight in YPD to an OD600 of 1 - 2 . 0 . 10D600 U of cells were suspended in YPD plus 0 . 75 % molten agar and then plated onto solid YPD . a - Factor was diluted into 20 % methanol , 0 . 4 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , and applied to the cell lawn as 5 - I . tl drops . Halos were scored after 40 h at 30°C for CHCI cells and 60 h at 30°C for chcl cells . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 106 , 1988 1454 Figure 1 . CPY processing in clathrin - deficient and wild - type strains . CHC1 strain GPYI100 and chcl - A8 strain GPYll03 were pulse - labeled for 5 min with [ 35S ] SO42 - , then allowed to continue growth in the presence of excess unlabeled SO42 - methionine and cysteine to prevent further labeling . Samples were harvested at the designated times after initiation of the chase , cells lysed , and CPY immunoprecipitated . Precipitated CPY was resolved and visualized by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography , pl , p2 , and CPY ( mature ) forms are described in the text . Electron Microscopy The procedures for fixation , embedding in Lowicryl resins , and immuno - labeling are detailed in van Tuinen and Riezman ( 49 ) . Results A general strategy has been adopted to assess the role of clathrin in various intercompartmental traffic routes . Sets of congenic clathrin - deficient ( chcl ) and wild - type ( CHC1 ) strains were generated by using single - step gene transplace - ment to disrupt CHC1 in haploid cells ( 33 ) . chcl Transfor - mants obtained by this technique were isogenic with the pa - rental CHC1 haploid , except at the CHC1 locus . Mutant strains grew two to three times more slowly than their wild - type counterparts . Pairs of congenic strains were then sub - jected to phenotypic analyses . ProCPY Is Matured at Wild - type Rates in chcl Cells The vacuolar protease CPY provides a diagnostic tool to characterize transit of newly synthesized proteins to the vac - uole . CPY is translated as an inactive zymogen that acquires four core oligosaccharides upon translocation into the en - doplasmic reticulum ( 18 , 44 ) . By SDS - PAGE , this form ( pl CPY ) has a mobility corresponding to 67 kD . During transit through the Golgi apparatus , a discrete addition of mannose residues produces the 69 - kD p2 species ( 44 ) . Proteolytic maturation of p2 CPY to enzymatically active CPY ( m form , 61 kD ) most likely takes place in the vacuole ( 9 , 44 , 53 ) . Conversion of pl to p2 to mCPY can easily be monitored by SDS - PAGE . The time course of proCPY modification was examined in congenic sets of CHC1 and chcl strains using a pulse - chase regimen . Cells were labeled for 5 min with [ 35S ] SO42 - and then allowed to continue growth in the presence of excess un - labeled SO4 - 2 , cysteine , and methionine . Total cell lysates were prepared from cells collected at intervals after im - plementation of the chase . CPY was immunoprecipitated from each lysate and resolved on SDS - polyacrylamide gels . As shown in Fig . 1 , top , proCPY synthesized in wild - type cells undergoes the anticipated , ordered series of mobility shifts . In mutant cells ( Fig . 1 , bottom ) , mCPY appears at a wild - type rate , although the conversion of pl to p2 CPY is somewhat abnormal . Densitometric analyses of the autora - diograms in Fig . 1 substantiates these conclusions ( Fig . 2 ) . In both mutant and wild - type cells , 50 % of the proCPY has been matured at ~ 9 min of chase ( Fig . 2 A ) . Compared with CHC1 cells , a slight delay in the processing ofpl CPY is evi - dent in mutant cells : t , ~ is 3 . 2 min in CHC1 cells and 5 . 8 min in chcl cells ( Fig . 2 B ) . Also , the p2 form in mutant cells accumulates to only 50 % of the wild - type level at the 5 - min chase points . The same results were obtained with two other sets of congenic strains . These experiments argue that , as as - sayed by proCPY maturation , a lack of clathrin heavy chain does not alter the rate of CPY delivery to the vacuole . There appears to be , however , a slight but reproducible anomaly in the ability of mutant cells to convert pl to p2 CPY . proCPY Is Not Secreted by chcl Strains Mislocalization of proCPY has been observed in three in - stances : overexpression of CPY from a multicopy plasmid carrying the CPY structural gene PRC1 ( 45 ) ; mutation of the vacuolar address determinant on CPY ( 24 , 48 ) ; mutation of other genes involved in directing traffic to the vacuole ( 2 , 37 ) . In each case , at least 40 % of the proCPY escaped sort - ing , was packaged into secretory vesicles , and secreted as p2 CPY into the medium . By comparison , wild - type strains se - crete 1 - 5 % of newly made proCPY . To examine the possibility that chcl cells fail ' to segregate proCPY from the secretory pathway , CPY secreted into the medium of mutant and wild - type stains was quantified . After a 15 - min labeling period , congenic strains were incubated for 45 min in chase medium . Samples were harvested at 0 and 45 min of chase and CPY was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates ( Fig . 3 C ) and medium fractions ( Fig . 3 M ) . SDS - PAGE analysis of precipitated CPY , shown in Fig . 3 , revealed that wild - type and mutant strains export similarly low levels of CPY . When corrected for the amount loaded on the gel ( see legend to Fig . 3 ) , < 5 % of the total CPY was detected the medium of each strain . Analyses conducted with three other pairs of congenic partners gave simlar results . Also , chcl cells did not secrete another vacuolar protein , pro - teinase A ( not shown ) . In each experiment , parallel cultures of wild - type strains bearing PRC1 on a multicopy plasmid exported (cid:127)50 % of the total CPY as the p2 form . Thus , clathrin - deficient cells retain the ability to sort vacuolar pro - teases from the secretory pathway with high fidelity .

CPY in chcl Cells Is Present in Vacuoles Immunolocalization of CPY in thin sections from mutant cells was undertaken to identify the subcellular residence of CPY . Fig . 4 , A - C show electron micrographs of thin sections of achc ! strain stained with afffinity - purified anti - CPY anti - bodies and protein A - gold complexes . For comparison , Fig . 4 D depicts a similarly processed congenic CHC1 strain . Vacuoles were located by their dense , granular contents en - closed within a membrane bilayer . This distinctive charac - teristic , revealed by uranylacetate and lead acetate ( or lead citrate ) staining , is a commonly used criterion for vacuole identification ( 37 , 40 , 49 ) . Clathrin - deficient mutant cells routinely exhibit accumulated membrane organelles and vacuolar structures ( arrowheads ) that appear more frag - mented and are more frequently multivesicular in cross sec - tion than vacuoles in wild - type cells ( 33 ) . In spite of the different internal morphologies of mutant and wild - type cells , most of the CPY in both cell types resides within vacuolar structures . In both mutant and wild - type cells , a low degree of labeling was present over organelles ( arrows ) smaller than the major vacuolar compartments . At present , the precise identification of these smaller structures is uncer - tain . They could represent smaller autonomous vacuoles , convolutions of the vacuole that appear as distinct structures in cross section , or another distinct membrane compart - ment . Small numbers of protein A - gold complexes in the cytoplasm represent background also observed in cells in which PRC1 has been deleted ( not shown ) . It is clear , in summary , that clathrin - deficient cells can sort newly synthesized CPY from the secretory pathway and de - liver it to vacuoles . was accompanied by a concomitant loss of cell - surface receptor activity , presumably due to receptor - ligand inter - nalization ( 22 ) . A modified version of the assay described by Chvatchko et al .

CHC1 strain GPYll00 and chcl - A8 strain GPYII03 were labeled for 15 min with [ 3sS ] SO42 - , then subjected to a chase regimen as described in Materials and Methods . Samples were collected at 0 and 45 min of chase and separated into cell ( C ) and medium ( M ) fractions . Cell lysates were prepared and CPY immunoprecipitated and displayed as in Fig . 1 .

Purified 35S - labeled a - factor was added to chcl sstl MATa or CHC1 sstl MATa cells ( 10 - s M a - factor , 3 × 10 s cells / ml ) . The sstl mutation eliminates a secreted protease which degrades a - factor ( 6 , 8 ) . After incubation at 24°C , cells were collected and washed with pH2 buffer , pH2 treatment strips a - factor bound to receptors at the cell surface leaving only internalized peptide associated with cells ( 7 ; Baker , D . , unpublished results ) . In our first experiments , despite the sstl mutation , exogenous a - factor was rapidly inactivated by chd , but not CHC1 , cells . Viable staining with methylene blue indicated that ' ~ 5 % of the mutant cells were inviable whereas < 0 . 1 % of the wild - type cells were dead . It seemed possible that ~ t - factor inacti - vation resulted from degradation by proteases released by inviable chcl cells . To circumvent this problem , genetic and biochemical strategies were applied .

Bound a - factor was measured by washing with the incubation medium as described in Materials and Methods . teolytic activity . Second , protease inhibitors TAME ( 8 ) and PMSF were added to the incubations . Under these condi - tions , both chcl and CHC1 strains internalized a - factor ( Fig . 5 A ) . The clathrin - deficient cells accumulated a - factor at nearly half the rate of wild - type cells . Fig . 5 B illustrates a compilation of results from several experiments . In four ex - periments , after 20 min at 24°C , uptake by chcl strains ranged from 36 to 50 % of wild - type levels ( with " no energy " background subtracted ) . Internalization was temperature ( not shown ) and energy dependent ( compare first two bars with third and fourth bars in Fig . 5 B ) . Finally , uptake of a - factor by chcl cells was receptor mediated since MATa chcl cells , which do not express a - factor receptor , failed to take up pheromone ( Figure 5 B , fifth bar ) . Reduced uptake of a - factor by chcl strains did not result from degradation of exogenous pheromones or decreased binding capacities . Degradation was examined using a cell replacement assay . An incubation of chcl cells ( either MATa or MATa ) with labeled a - factor at 24°C was terminated after 20 min by sedimenting the cells . The supernatant fraction was then incubated with fresh CHC1 cells for 75 min at 24°C . The amount of radiolabel internalized during the two incuba - tions equalled the amount of biologically active ct - factor added initially ( see Materials and Methods ) . Thus , during a 20 - rain incubation with mutant cells , no significant degrada - tion of a - factor was observed . This experiment also indicated that the absence of a - factor internalization by chcl MATa cells was not due to competition from unlabeled a - factor secreted by cells during the incubation . Binding of a - factor was measured at 24°C by incubating labeled pheromone with varying concentrations of cells in the presence of energy in - hibitors to prevent internalization ( 23 ; also see Materials and Methods ) . Bound or - factor was determined after a pH 5 . 5 wash . Fig . 5 C demonstrates that binding to chcl and CHC1 ceils was identical . In the assay described by Chvatchko et al . ( 7 ) internalized or - factor was rapidly degraded . We were unable to detect degradation of internal pheromone in either mutant or wild - type cells . This probably reflects the lowered proteolytic ac - tivity due to the prbl and pep4 mutations . Y . Chvatchko and H . Riezman have made a similar observation using pep4 strains ( personal communication ) . We have also attempted to measure fluid - phase uptake of Lucifer Yellow CH ( 36 ) . Unfortunately , the level of dye ac - cumulated in our wild - type strains was barely detectable . In addition , a high background accumulation of dye by inviable chcl cells precluded unequivocal determination of dye up - take . MATa chcl Cells Respond Normally to a - Factor Mutant yeast strains defective in accumulation of a fluid - phase endocytic marker , Lucifer Yellow CH , are unable to respond physiologically to or - factor ( 7 ) . One of these strains , harboring the endl mutation , fails to internalize a - factor . These studies correlate endocytic capacity with the ability to respond to mating pheromone . The experiment illustrated in Fig . 6 indicates that the re - duced rate of a - factor uptake by chcl cells had no effect on one response to a - factor , cell - cycle arrest . The sensitivities of chcl and CHC1 cells to cell - cycle arrest imposed by a - factor were compared by spotting dilutions of pheromone onto lawns of cells . Zones of arrested cells appear as clear - ings or " halos " in the lawn . The radius of the halo is a mea - sure of the sensitivity of cells in the lawn to pheromone ( 25 ) . Equal halo sizes were produced by two - fold dilutions of a - factor spotted onto lawns of chcl and CHC1 cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Our results argue that receptor - mediated endocytosis can occur in the absence of clathrin heavy chain , albeit at re - duced rates , chcl null alleles do not alter the cellular re - sponses of MATa cells to or - factor and , accordingly , MATa chcl cells mate at near wild - type efficiencies ( not shown ) .

Mutant cells properly localize newly synthesized vacuolar proteases and carry out receptor - mediated uptake of a - factor mating phero - mone . Clathrin is therefore , unexpectedly , not required for either pathway , or can be replaced by a functional homologue in clathrin - deficient cells . Transport of Newly Synthesized Proteins to the Vacuole Comparison of CPY transport in chcl and CHC1 strains has shown that mCPY appears at identical rates . Precursor CPY molecules are efficiently diverted from the secretory pathway and immunolocalization studies located most CPY mole - cules in vacuolar structures . These findings argue that clathrin does not provide a necessary function during vacuo - lar protein sorting and delivery . However , a slight defect was apparent in the conversion of pl to p2 CPY in mutant cells . The reduced rate of glycosyl maturation of pl CPY in chcl cells could represent an effect of clathrin deficiency on man - nosyltransferase activity or organization , but ifpl CPY were transported from the Golgi apparatus to the vacuole , lower molecular mass forms of mCPY would be expected , mCPY from CHC1 and chcl migrate identically on SDS - PAGE ( Payne , G . S . , unpublished data ) . While the anomalous delay in glycosyl maturation of CPY in chcl strains remains unex - plained , there appears to be no compromise in the rate of for - mation of the proteolytically mature enzyme . These results contrast sharply with the characteristics of yeast mutant strains selected for mislocalization of vacuolar proteins ( vpl mutants [ 37 ] ; vpt mutants [ 2 ] ) . Mutations in as many as 50 genes have been obtained by selecting for effi - cient secretion of carboxypeptidase Y in a precursor or hy - brid protein form . Many of these mutant strains secrete a large fraction of CPY in a proenzyme form and the kinetics of transport are comparable to that observed for a typical secreted protein . In spite of a dramatic reduction in the intra - cellular levels of soluble vacuolar proteins , many of these mislocalization mutants exhibit normal rates of growth . Clearly , the clathrin heavy chain gene is not a member of the vacuole protein sorting gene family . Protease A is required for maturation of proCPY ( 1 ) , yet when it is mislocalized along with proCPY in vpl or vpt mu - tants , both molecules persist in a precursor form ( 2 , 37 ) . Once again , in contrast to this phenotype , chcl mutant cells produce and retain mature protease A ( unpublished data ) . It is unlikely that mature CPY and protease A are formed before the vacuolar protein sorting event in chcl mutant cells . The essential sorting determinant has been identified in the propeptide segment of both proteases ( 24 , 27 , 48 ) . Deletion of this signal ( s ) results in secretion of the mutant protease . Hence , premature processing of proCPY would remove the localization signal and result in mature , secreted CPY . Although our results imply that clathrin is dispensible in transport of vacuolar proteins , they do not exclude the possi - bility that newly made proteins pass through a clathrin - coated compartment in route to the vacuole . This seems likely in the lysosome - oriented pathway in mammalian cells . Lysosomal hydrolases an6 the cation - independent , 212 - kD mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ( involved in selective target - ing of lysosomal protein to lysosomes ) have been identified in purified clathrin - coated vesicles ( 4 , 5 , 41 ) . In addition , im - munocytochemical studies have revealed lysosomal proteins and mannose - 6 - phosphate receptors in coated regions of the Golgi apparatus and in coated vesicles ( 3 , 13 , 14 ) . Similar studies of yeast vacuolar proteins await more purified prepa - rations of clathrin - coated vesicles and elucidation of the in - tracellular distribution of clathrin - coated membranes . Endocytosis We have measured internalization of a - factor to assess recep - tor - mediated endocytosis by chcl cells . Jenness and Spatrick ( 22 ) and Chvatchko et al . ( 7 ) have recently provided evi - dence for uptake of a - factor via an endocytic pathway . Inter - nalization of a - factor is temperature , energy , and receptor dependent and is accompanied by a loss of surface binding sites . Mutant yeast strains defective in fluid - phase accumula - tion of Lucifer Yellow CH are also unable to take up a - factor . Uptake of a - factor into the vacuole has been confirmed by direct visualization of 3H - labeled pheromone as autoradio - graphic grain tracks on thin sections ( Chvatchko , Y , E . van Tuinen , and H . Riezman , unpublished results ) . Further - more , internalized a - factor is not degraded in strains lacking active vacuolar proteases ( pep4 ) . Proof of an endocytic mechanism awaits the detection of a vesicular intermediate in the uptake of these molecules . a - Factor is internalized by yeast cells in which clathrin has been specifically and completely eliminated . Although this result was unexpected , portents have been reported in studies of mammalian cells . Huet et al . ( 21 ) stimulated endocytosis of human fibroblast histocompatibility antigens with an anti - Payne et al . chcl Yeast Vacuolar Protein Traffic / Endocytosis 1459 body directed against 132 - microglobulin . Immunoelectron microscopy has shown that uptake occurs through surface in - vaginations and endocytic vesicles that do not display clath - rin coats . Another group ( 29 ) reported that inhibition of clathrin - coated pit formation in human Hep2 cells by intra - cellular K ÷ depletion completely blocks transferrin inter - nalization but reduces endocytosis of ricin toxin by only 50 % . Both of these studies suggest the existence of a clath - rin - independent endocytic pathway . In a more direct ap - proach , two groups have microinjected anticlathrin antibod - ies into living cells and measured the endocytosis of molecules known to enter cells through clathrin - coated inter - mediates . In one case , uptake of ct2 - macroglobulin , no effect was observed ( 50 ) . In the second study , a 50 % diminu - tion of Semliki forest virus endocytosis was obtained ( 10 ) . Based on the studies using mammalian cells , and the data presented here , it appears that clathrin is not essential for receptor - mediated endocytosis . Thus , clathrin cannot be the sole mediator of plasma membrane vesiculation during en - docytosis . Our studies do not distinguish between three pos - sible interpretations of this conclusion : ( a ) clathrin does not directly provide the force necessary to generate a vesicle from the plasma membrane but , instead , expedites endocyto - sis through other capacities such as clustering certain surface receptors ; ( b ) clathrin normally is the factor responsible for vesicle formation during receptor - mediated endocytosis but another protein can provide complementing function ; ( c ) both clathrin - dependent and - independent pathways exist and ~ t - factor is normally internalized by a clathrin - independent route . The reduced uptake of a - factor by chcl cells is difficult to interpret and could reflect any of the scenarios just listed . If clathrin serves an auxiliary role in all endocytosis or if a heavy chain functional homologue exists , then elimination of CHC1 could expose less efficient endocytic pathways . On the other hand , ct - factor may normally enter cells through a clathrin - independent route and the reduced internalization in chcl cells may be an indirect consequence of defects in other transport pathways . Isolation of conditonally defective CHC1 alleles and attempts to identify clathrin heavy chain homo - logues should aid in distinguishing these possibilities . Recently , the sequence of the putative structural gene for the ~ t - factor receptor , STE2 , has been determined ( 30 ) . The deduced amino acid sequence reveals a protein with seven potential membrane - spanning domains . This structural mo - tif is shared by mammalian cell I ~ - adrenergic receptors ( see reference 43 for review ) . In contrast , other growth factor and nutrient receptor polypeptides , such as epidermal growth factor and low density lipoprotein receptors , are predicted to span the membrane only once . With this distinc - tion in mind , it may be relevant that , unlike epidermal growth factor and low density lipoprotein receptors , ~ adrenergic receptors are internalized ( termed sequestration ) by an un - defined mechanism ( 43 ) . In particular , it is unclear whether internalization occurs through clathrin - coated intermediates . Lemmon and Jones ( 28 ) have identified a unique yeast strain that is inviable when CHC1 is disrupted . Inviability is due to a single genetic locus , named SCD1 , which is unlinked to CHC1 . In contrast , we have surveyed > 10 strains from four separate laboratories without observing a locus that leads to inviability when combined with chcl ( 33 ) . It thus seems likely that the strain described by Lemmon and Jones har - bors an infrequent , possibly altered allele of SCD1 . This al - lele could mark a gene whose product can normally substi - tute for clathrin directly , or indirectly as a component of a parallel pathway . However , other less relevant explanations could apply and further information is needed to establish the nature of SCDI ( see reference 33 for a detailed discus - sion ) . The existence of SCD1 does not affect our conclusions that transport to the vacuole and endocytosis can be sustained in the absence of clathrin . Finally , we caution against concluding from our studies that clathrin does not play an important role in intracellular protein transport . Yeast cells devoid of clathrin heavy chain display compromised growth rates , accumulation of mem - brane organelles , a Golgi body or postGolgi body delay in export of a secreted protein , and a reduced ability to internal - ize a - factor ( 32 , 33 ) . Preliminary results also indicate that another late Golgi or nascent secretory vesicle event , proteo - lytic maturation of the a - factor precursor , is disturbed in MATa chcl cells . Hence , although clathrin is not required for the essential functions originally postulated , it may facili - tate a subset of intracellular transport processes . Further - more , alternative mechanisms that back up clathrin function in normal cells may be pressed into service or even enhanced in clathrin - deficient cells . lmmunoelectron microscopy was carried out in the laboratory of Howard Riezman , supported by a grant from the Swiss National Science Founda - tion .
