Although a large number of cellular factors have been identiﬁed that stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin nucleation , only a small number of studies so far have addressed which factors promote actin network debranching [ 2 – 4 ] . Here , we investi - gated the function of a conserved homolog of ADF / coﬁlin , glia maturation factor ( GMF ) [ 5 , 6 ] . We found that S . cerevi - siae GMF ( also called Aim7 ) localizes in vivo to cortical actin patches and displays synthetic genetic interactions with ADF / coﬁlin . However , GMF lacks detectable actin binding or severing activity and instead binds tightly to Arp2 / 3 complex . Using in vitro evanescent wave microscopy , we demonstrated that GMF potently stimulates debranching of actin ﬁlaments produced by Arp2 / 3 complex . Further , GMF inhibits nucleation of new daughter ﬁlaments . Together , these data suggest that GMF binds Arp2 / 3 complex to both ‘‘prune’’ daughter ﬁlaments at the branch points and inhibit new actin assembly . These activities and its genetic interac - tion with ADF / coﬁlin support a role for GMF in promoting the remodeling and / or disassembly of branched networks . Therefore , ADF / coﬁlin and GMF , members of the same superfamily , appear to have evolved to interact with actin and actin - related proteins , respectively , and to make mecha - nistically distinct contributions to the remodeling of cortical actin structures . Results and Discussion Glia maturation factor ( GMF ) is an evolutionarily conserved member of the ADF / coﬁlin superfamily based on sequence comparisons and structural homology [ 5 , 6 ] . Sequence alignments and three - dimensional structure comparisons suggest that although many general features of the ADF / coﬁlin fold are retained in GMF - g , the actin - binding residues on ADF / coﬁlin are not well conserved ( red bars , Figure 1A ) . Therefore , the cellular functions of GMF may have diverged from those of ADF / coﬁlin [ 6 ] . To study the function of S . cerevisiae GMF ( YDR063W ; also called Aim7 , or a ltered i nheritance rate of m itochondria [ 7 ] ) , we ﬁrst constructed an internal fusion of GFP to GMF , which was functional ( see below ) . GMF - GFP localized to the cytoplasm and cortical puncta . Localization of GMF - GFP in a strain expressing integrated Abp1 - RFP , a marker for cortical actin patches [ 8 ] , revealed that most GMF - GFP puncta correspond to actin patches ( Figure 1B ) . However , not all Abp1 - RFP patches were labeled with GMF - GFP , suggesting that GMF - GFP may only be present on actin patches for a portion of their lifetime . A similar observation has been made for Cof1 - GFP [ 9 ] . Thus , GMF , like Cof1 , may be a late - arriving component of actin patches . Next , we made a deletion of the GMF1 / AIM7 gene . gmf1 D ( aim7 D ) caused no overt defects in cell growth ( Figure 1C ) or morphology ( not shown ) , as previously reported [ 7 ] . To explore the relationship between GMF and ADF / coﬁlin , we crossed gmf1 D to a partial loss - of - function coﬁlin allele , cof1 - 22 [ 10 ] . The gmf1 D cof1 - 22 double mutant showed more pronounced defects in cell growth compared to cof1 - 22 after serial dilution and plating ( Figure 1D ) . The synthetic defects were very evident at 34 (cid:2) C , but also could be observed at 25 (cid:2) C by comparing growth rates of strains in liquid medium ( Figure 1E ) . The GMF - GFP construct used above rescued the synthetic growth defects of the gmf1 D cof1 - 22 strain ( Figure 1F ) . We investigated whether GMF , like ADF / coﬁlin , is able to bind and / or sever ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) in vitro . In contrast to Cof1 , puriﬁed GMF showed minimal cosedimenta - tion with F - actin , even at the highest concentrations tested ( 10 and 20 m M ) , when either rabbit muscle actin or yeast actin was used ( Figure 2A ) . In addition , we failed to detect a binding interaction between GMF and NBD - labeled actin monomers ( not shown ) . Further , GMF did not affect the kinetics of actin assembly or disassembly ( Figures 2B – 2D ) , whereas Cof1 accelerated both processes , attributable to its severing activity [ 11 ] . GMF also did not enhance actin disassembly effects of Cof1 ( Figure 2C ) , indicating that the two proteins do not synergize in actin severing . Taken together , the genetic , colocalization , and biochemical data suggest that GMF has evolved a function distinct from ADF / coﬁlin , but one that nevertheless overlaps physiologically with that of ADF / coﬁlin . To better understand GMF cellular function , we isolated from crude cell extracts proteins that bound to GST - GMF beads but not control GST beads ( Figure 2E ) . Excised gel bands were identiﬁed by mass spectrometry as actin , Arp2 / 3 complex subunits , and the Arp2 / 3 - interacting protein coro - nin / Crn1 [ 12 ] . These results suggested an interaction ( either direct or indirect ) between GMF and Arp2 / 3 complex , consis - tent with previous coimmunoprecipitation results in mamma - lian cells and two - hybrid studies in yeast [ 5 , 13 – 15 ] . Binding assays using puriﬁed proteins demonstrated that soluble GMF binds Arp2 / 3 complex immobilized on beads ( Figure 2F ) , indicating a direct interaction . To study the potential effects of GMF on Arp2 / 3 complex activity , we ﬁrst compared Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly kinetics at different concentrations of GMF ( Fig - ure 3A ) . GMF inhibited Arp2 / 3 complex - induced actin nucle - ation in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 3B ) but had no signiﬁcant effect on actin assembly kinetics in the absence of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3A and Figure 2B ) . * Correspondence : goode @ brandeis . edu 4 These authors contributed equally to this work Half - maximal inhibition of 20 nM Arp2 / 3 complex was observed at approximately 250 nM GMF , suggesting a submi - cromolar dissociation constant . To further investigate these effects , we used time - resolved total internal reﬂection ﬂuores - cence ( TIRF ) microscopy to image nucleation and growth of branched actin ﬁlament networks formed by 20 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( activated by 300 nM VCA ) in the presence and absence of 1 m M GMF ( Figure 3C ) . Imaging network growth allowed us to unambiguously identify the mother and daughter ﬁlaments at each node . Consistent with the bulk kinetic analysis , GMF caused a marked decrease in rate of daughter nucleation events per unit length of ﬁlament ( Figure 3D ) but no signiﬁcant change in elongation rate ( Figure 3E ) . Together , these data suggest that binding of GMF to Arp2 / 3 complex suppresses nucleation of daughter ﬁlament assembly . The TIRF experiments were performed under conditions in which actin ﬁlaments were not attached to the surface of the microscope slide but could diffuse in two dimensions within the image plane [ 16 ] . In the absence of GMF , branches were stable ; detachment was never seen in time - lapse observations Figure 1 .

Current Biology Vol 20 No 9 862 of 57 individual branches ( lasting on average 10 min from the time each daughter ﬁlament began to elongate ) . However , the addition of low concentrations of GMF ( 10 nM ) induced numerous branch detachments within the ﬁrst few minutes after daughter nucleation ( Figure 4A ) . This effect was speciﬁc to branch points , because GMF did not induce detectable severing at other locations on ﬁlaments . The debranching activity of GMF was potent ; it was observed at 10 nM GMF , a concentration below the effective range for inhibition of nucle - ation and that caused no overt change in rate of branch nucle - ation or elongation ( Figure 3 and data not shown ) . At this concentration , GMF reduced the characteristic lifetime of branches in 75 % of the population to 190 6 70 s ( Figure 4B ) . The remaining 25 % of daughter ﬁlaments appeared as a stable fraction unaffected by GMF . This fraction most likely did not debranch simply because insufﬁcient GMF was present in the reaction ; much of the GMF present may have been seques - tered by Arp2 / 3 complex , which was in molar excess ( 20 nM Arp2 / 3 complex versus 10 nM GMF ) . At higher GMF concen - trations , close to 100 % of daughter ﬁlaments debranched , and the lifetime was further reduced ( 120 6 20 s at 50 nM GMF ; 90 6 20 s at 200 nM GMF ) . In reactions without GMF , the lifetime was estimated to be longer than 1 hr ( see Supple - mental Experimental Procedures ) . The observed debranching kinetics are consistent with a simple mechanism in which GMF binding to Arp2 / 3 complexes at branch sites induces daughter ﬁlament dissociation , and most GMF molecules remain asso - ciated with Arp2 / 3 complex for the duration of the experiment rather than being recycled and made available for subsequent debranching events . Recently , it was shown that ADF / coﬁlin not only severs F - actin but also stimulates ﬁlament debranching by binding to F - actin and promoting dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex [ 4 ] . To better understand the respective roles of GMF and ADF / coﬁlin in remodeling actin networks , we directly compared their effects by TIRF microscopy . In a microscope ﬂow Figure 2 .

Data shown ( mean 6 standard deviation [ SD ] ) are from two experiments . GMF Debranches Arp2 / 3 - Nucleated Actin Filaments 863 chamber , actin was assembled for 10 – 15 min with Arp2 / 3 complex and VCA . Then , buffer containing 50 nM GMF and / or 50 nM Cof1 ( without G - actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , or VCA ) was introduced , and ﬁlaments were observed for several minutes . Under these conditions , there was no new ﬁlament assembly and we could monitor the products of GMF - and Cof1 - induced disassembly even though ﬁlaments were not tethered to the chamber surface . Exposing branched ﬁlaments to GMF produced long , mostly unbranched ﬁlaments , whereas addition of Cof1 yielded numerous , very short ﬁlaments ( Fig - ure 4C ) . The fragmentation by Cof1 was extensive ( Figure 4C ) and rapid ( data not shown ) , such that we were unable to assess whether or not some of the ﬁlaments were derived from debranching events rather than general severing of F - actin . Nonetheless , we observed that some of the short fragments produced by Cof1 remained branched ( Figure 4C ) . When branched networks were treated with GMF and Cof1 together ( 50 nM each ) , the resulting ﬁlaments were short and largely unbranched , as expected from the individual effects of both proteins . From these data , it is clear that GMF and Cof1 have strikingly different effects in the remodeling and disassembly of branched ﬁlaments , consistent with major differences in their mechanisms ( see below ) . Further analysis is required to learn whether and how the separate effects of GMF and Cof1 might be coordinated to remodel actin networks . The results presented here may help to explain how cellular actin networks are rapidly remodeled during cell motility , endocytosis , cytokinesis , and intracellular transport . Arp2 / 3 complex binds to sides of preexisting ﬁlaments and nucleates formation of daughter ﬁlaments at 70 (cid:2) angles , producing branched ‘‘dendritic’’ arrays [ 17 – 19 ] . These activities play an important role in driving lamellipodial protrusion , endocytic vesicle internalization , and intracellular transport [ 20 ] . Ultra - structural analyses indicate that Arp2 / 3 - nucleated actin networks at these locations consist of branched ﬁlaments [ 21 – 23 ] , although this remains disputed at the lamellipodial leading edge [ 24 ] . It is not yet understood how branched networks nucleated by Arp2 / 3 are rapidly disassembled in vivo . Branched ﬁlaments assembled by Arp2 / 3 in vitro persist for tens of minutes ( [ 19 , 25 ] and this study ) , but in vivo they are dismantled within a few seconds at the leading edge and endocytic loci [ 20 , 26 ] . This suggests that cells may require additional factors to disassemble branched ﬁlaments . ADF / coﬁlin is one factor that stimulates debranching , by binding to F - actin and promoting dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex , possibly through propagation of conformational changes in F - actin [ 4 ] .

Error bars represent SD within the population of observed daughter ﬁlaments . Current Biology Vol 20 No 9 864 Here we have identiﬁed a new role for GMF as a factor that debranches ﬁlaments . Although GMF is a structural cousin of ADF / coﬁlin , it has a distinct mechanism . GMF binds directly to Arp2 / 3 complex , not actin , and ‘‘prunes’’ daughter ﬁlaments at the branch points without severing elsewhere . This pro - duces long unbranched ﬁlaments . GMF also inhibits Arp2 / 3 nucleation of daughter ﬁlaments . Both activities , debranching and inhibition of nucleation , may contribute to remodeling the architecture of dendritic actin networks into linear ﬁlaments . In contrast , the dual function of ADF / coﬁlin to sever and de - branch ﬁlaments leads to fragmentation of branched networks into very short ﬁlaments , which can promote their net disas - sembly , or in other contexts amplify barbed ends to promote new assembly [ 27 ] . These observations highlight the mecha - nistic distinctions between GMF and ADF / coﬁlin , as well as the targeted speciﬁcity of GMF . Interestingly , GMF activities appear to be related to those of coronin . Coronin binds to Arp2 / 3 complex with high afﬁnity and directly inhibits nucle - ation [ 12 ] , and more recently it was reported that coronin Figure4 .

( C ) Disassembly of branched ﬁlaments observed by TIRF microscopy before and w 100 s after addition of 50 nM GMF and / or 50 nM Cof1 . ( D ) Working model for GMF function . GMF binds Arp2 / 3 complex and both prunes ﬁlament branches and inhibits nucleation . In doing so , GMF may functionally cooperatewith ADF / coﬁlin to promote disassembly of actin networks ( coordinated disassembly pathway ) , or it may independently remodel dendritic networks into unbranched networks ( remodeling pathway ) , which may be later disassembled by ADF / coﬁlin . promotes debranching [ 3 ] . Given that we isolated coronin and Arp2 / 3 complex on GMF afﬁnity columns , this raises the intriguing possibility that GMF and coro - nin work together in regulating Arp2 / 3 complex . Based on the activities , localization , and genetic interactions of GMF , we conclude that it may have two different roles in vivo . In some cellular contexts , GMFandADF / coﬁlinmayworkinconcert to promote disassembly and turnover of branched actin structures ( Figure 4D ; coordinated disassembly pathway ) . In other contexts , GMF may act indepen - dently of coﬁlin to remodel branched networks , by pruning branches and in - hibiting nucleation , producing long ﬁla - ments ( Figure 4D ; remodeling pathway ) . Our data also raise many new ques - tions . First , how do low concentrations of GMF dismantle existing branches whereas only higher concentrations prevent nucleation of new branches ? The simplest hypothesis is that both activities share the same underlying biochemical mechanism , in which GMF alters Arp2 / 3 conformation to antagonize its binding to mother ﬁla - ments . Saturation of Arp2 / 3 with GMF may be required to effectively block nucleation , whereas only transient binding of GMF may be needed to induce detachment of a branch . Second , did ADF / coﬁlin and GMF diverge evolutionarily from a common ancestor to interact with actin and actin - related proteins ( Arp2 and / or Arp3 ) , respectively ? Third , do the activ - ities of S . cerevisiae GMF extend to mammalian homologs ? Mammals have two GMF genes , GMF - b and GMF - g , which together are widely expressed [ 5 , 28 , 29 ] . In addition , GMF - g has been localized to the leading edge of mammalian cells and coimmunoprecipitates with Arp2 / 3 complex [ 5 ] . Finally , what mechanisms control the timing of GMF interactions with Arp2 / 3 complex ? This may involve ATP hydrolysis or phosphate release on Arp2 and / or Arp3 [ 30 , 31 ] or in actin GMF Debranches Arp2 / 3 - Nucleated Actin Filaments 865 subunits in the mother or daughter ﬁlaments proximal to branch junctions . There is also the possibility that GMF activity , like that of ADF / coﬁlin , is controlled by phosphoryla - tion , which has been suggested for mammalian GMF - g [ 5 ] . Experimental Procedures For details , see Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Actin Assembly and Disassembly Kinetics Rabbit muscle actin was used in all experiments unless yeast actin is indicated . GMF , Cof1 , and VCA fragment of Las17 / WASp were puriﬁed from E . coli . Arp2 / 3 complex was puriﬁed from S . cerevisiae . Assembly and disassembly assays were performed essentially as described [ 11 ] with gel - ﬁltered actin monomers ( 5 % pyrene - labeled ) for assembly assays and preassembled F - actin ( 10 % pyrene - labeled ) for disassembly assays . In disassembly assays , preassembled F - actin ( 2 m M ) was incubated with GMFand / orCof1for250s , andthen4 m MVitaminD - bindingprotein ( human plasma Gc - globulin , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) was added to initiate disassembly . Cell Imaging A low copy ( CEN ) plasmid expressing GMF - GFP was transformed into yeast strain BGY3091 , which has an integrated copy of Abp1 - RFP . Trans - formed cells were grown in selective media at 25 (cid:2) C to log phase , then imaged on a Zeiss E600 microscope ( Thornwood , NY ) equipped with a Hammamatsu Orca ER CCD camera ( Bridgewater , NJ ) running Openlab software ( Improvision Inc . , Waltham , MA ) . TIRF Microscopy Analysis RMAwaslabeledonlysineresidueswithAlexa - 488NHS ( MolecularProbes , Carlsbad , CA ) , and was mixed at 10 % with unlabeled actin ( 90 % ) , then diluted to 1 m M . Fluorescence emissions were collected on an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( EMCCD ; Andor , South Windsor , CT ) for 0 . 1 s laser exposures at 5 s intervals to generate time - lapse recordings . Analysis of actin elongation and branching rates was performed by tracing ﬁlaments as described ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . Branching rates , k br , were calculated by counting the number of observed branch nucleation events , N br , and dividing by the integral of the total ﬁla - mentlength , L tot , observedoverthecourseoftheTIRFrecording , according to : k br = N br = R L tot ð t Þ dt . Branch nucleation times were calculated by linear extrapolation of daughter ﬁlament elongation back to zero length , and branch lifetimes were then calculated as the time from nucleation to the midpoint between the frame in which the branch was last observed and the frame in which the dissociated branch was ﬁrst observed .
