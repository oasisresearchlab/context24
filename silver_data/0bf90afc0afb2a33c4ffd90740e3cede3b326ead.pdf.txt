As fluorine has the highest electronegativity coupled to an enhanced bond strength of the C – F bond compared to a C – H bond , C – F bonds are often leveraged as replacements for C – H bonds when the latter presents a liability at a saturated ( sp 3 ) carbon centre , especially for benzylic C – H bonds prone to metabolic oxidation 2 , 3 . The catalytic , enantioselective formation of tertiary C – F bonds is synthetically challenging 4 and has tra - ditionally been accomplished through bond formation adjacent ( defined as α ) to a pre - existing functional group ( Fig . 1a ) 4 – 7 . This is highlighted by ( 1 ) the functionalization of carbonyl derivatives via the reaction of an enolate or an enolate equivalent with either an electrophilic fluorinating reagent 8 – 16 or an arylating / alkylating reagent 17 – 21 , which leads to a plethora of α - functionalized carbonyl products , or ( 2 ) the reaction of mainly cyclic alkene substrates with an electrophilic fluorinating source followed by elimination to form an allylic fluoride product 22 , 23 . Trapping of the reactive intermediate in this process with a nucleophile to yield the formal alkene difunctionalization product is also possible 24 – 28 . A recently reported strategy by Butcher and Hartwig provides an alterna - tive approach to acyclic allylic fluorides that involves nucleophilic attack onto a π - allyl – iridium species derived from a styrenyl fluo - ride electrophile 29 . Although these methods constitute excellent entries to produce the desired tertiary C – F stereocentres , the spe - cific synthetic positional limitation reflects the requirement of a functional group adjacent to the site at which the fluoride is placed . To access products that do not place the fluoride directly adjacent to either a carbonyl or an alkenyl group ( Fig . 1b ) , we envisioned a strategy by which an enantioselective Pd - catalysed Heck reac - tion of alkenyl fluoride substrates with arylboronic acids could be developed 30 , 31 . By performing such a reaction , a tertiary C – F benzylic stereocentre could be constructed at modular locations from the carbonyl functional groups . A successful implementation of this strategy would enable direct synthetic access to previously unavailable building blocks as procedures to replace either the ter - tiary benzylic C – H or C – OH bonds with fluoride have yet to be reported at such sites . Significant issues were anticipated in exploring this reaction sequence due to the general reactivity of alkenyl fluorides and accessibility of the substrate itself . Alkenyl fluorides are not tradi - tional alkenes , as exemplified by their unique 13 C chemical shifts observed with a downfield shift of ~ 160 ppm , similar to that of an amide , for the C – F bond ( Fig . 1b ) . Comparatively , the other car - bon has a chemical shift of ~ 105 ppm and the C – H bond attached has a rather upfield shift of 4 . 8 ppm , which suggests a highly elec - tronically biased alkene . Thus , alkenyl fluorides have been reported as substrates for Heck - type reactions with insertions that occur at C B , but with various caveats 32 – 38 . The first is that trisubstituted alke - nyl fluorides of type 1 have not been described as substrates in Heck reactions and , presumably , would be poorly reactive due to the high electronegativity of the F substituent and the congested nature of the alkene 35 . Consistent with this , our lab has reported that alkenes bearing only carbon substituents with smaller groups ( for example , disubstituted versus trisubstituted alkenes ) as well as substrates that are more electron rich ( for example , alkyl versus aryl ) react faster in Heck - type reactions 30 , 31 , 39 . The second issue is that if migratory insertion is effective , the resulting Pd – alkyl intermediate A ( Fig . 1b ) may have the propensity to undergo β - fluoride elimination accord - ing to reports that involve alkenyl fluorides as Heck coupling part - ners 32 , 33 , 37 . This would ultimately remove the F from the desired product and probably inhibit the necessary chain - walking process enabled by a cationic Pd catalyst as the fluoride would probably form neutral Pd intermediates 40 . Moreover , a significant obstruc - tion to progress in this area has been access to the desired substrates ( for example , 1a , Fig . 1d ) , which traditionally requires a lengthy synthetic sequence to prepare 41 , 42 . Recently , a simple method was reported by the Toste team , which overcomes previous limitations by enabling a modular preparation of geometrically pure allylic alkenyl fluoride derivatives in a two - step procedure ( Fig . 1c ) 43 . Results and discussion Using this route , substrate 1a was prepared and submitted to vari - ous conditions for Heck - type reactions of alkenyl alcohols previ - ously reported by our lab ( Fig . 1d ) 30 , 31 . The use of an allylic alcohol as the starting point for reaction optimization was anticipated to Enantioselective construction of remote tertiary carbon – fluorine bonds Jianbo Liu 1 , Qianjia Yuan 1 , F . Dean Toste 2 and Matthew S . Sigman 1 * The carbon – fluorine bond engenders distinctive physicochemical properties and significant changes to general reactivity . The development of catalytic , enantioselective methods to set stereocentres that contain a benzylic C – F bond is a rapidly evolving goal in synthetic chemistry . Although there have been notable advances that enable the construction of secondary stereocen - tres that contain both a C – F and a C – H bond on the same carbon , significantly fewer strategies are defined to access stereocen - tres that incorporate a tertiary C – F bond , especially those remote from pre - existing activating groups . Here we report a general method that establishes C – F tertiary benzylic stereocentres by forging a C – C bond via a Pd - catalysed enantioselective Heck reaction of acyclic alkenyl fluorides with arylboronic acids . This method provides a platform to rapidly incorporate significant functionality about the benzylic tertiary fluoride by virtue of the diversity of both reaction partners , as well as the ability to install the stereocentres remotely from pre - existing functional groups .

Unfortunately , poor reactivity was observed under these conditions , with the best preliminary result of 24 % yield using dimethylformamide as the solvent , a Cu salt and a PyrOx ligand ( Fig . 1d , entry 1 ) . An exten - sive evaluation of the reaction conditions revealed three significant changes that were required to obtain a robust reaction : ( 1 ) methanol ( MeOH ) was identified as a uniquely effective solvent that nearly doubled the yield compared to the use of any other common solvent ( Fig . 1d , entry 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 gives the complete screening details ) ) , ( 2 ) the addition of dibenzylideneacetone ( dba ) , which may rescue any long - lived Pd ( 0 ) intermediates that undergo slow oxida - tion , was essential ( entry 3 ) and ( 3 ) in contrast to related oxidative Heck reactions , Cu salts are detrimental to the reaction outcome ( entry 5 ) 30 , 31 . The inspiration for the use of dba was found through the observation that Pd ( dba ) 2 gave modestly improved yields when used instead of a Pd ( ii ) complex as the precatalyst ( Supplementary Fig . 1 gives details ) . In all , the reaction yield was improved to 90 % for the model substrate . Of particular note , by exploiting the simple chiral PyrOx ligand , which is readily prepared in two steps and com - mercially available , an exceptionally high enantiomeric ratio ( e . r . ) of 99 : 1 was observed . Using the other alkene stereoisomer ( Fig . 1d , entry 4 ) leads to the conservation of a high enantioselectivity ( 98 : 2 e . r . ) with the other enantiomer of the product formed in a reduced yield . Owing to the ease of access to the Z - alkene isomer and the better performance in terms of yield , this alkene isomer was utilized throughout the remainder of the study . Applying the optimized conditions , the scope of the reaction was first evaluated by exploring the nature of the arylboronic acid coupling partner ( Table 1 ) . In general , the use of aryl rings that are more electron rich gave enhanced yields compared to those of the more electron poor examples ( for example , 2a – 2d versus 2e and 2f ) . This is presumably due to a faster relative rate of migratory inser - tion with more nucleophilic arenes 30 . In all cases , though , the enantioselectivity remained high in an e . r . range of 95 : 5 to 99 : 1 . Both m - methoxy ( 2g ) and m - acetamide ( 2h ) groups were toler - ated well under the reaction conditions . Multisubstituted arenes , which include halogen - substituted arylboronic acids , were also effective coupling partners ( 2i – 2n ) , highlighted by 2l and 2m . Finally , ortho substitution on the arene was allowed , as demon - strated by the success of 2n , which was produced in a reduced yield but high enantioselectivity .

The substrate scope of the alkenyl fluoride reaction partner was explored broadly , enabled by the simple synthetic procedure to access them ( Table 1 ) 43 . Different hydrocarbon substituents gener - ally performed well ( 2o – 2t ) . Surprisingly , a large cyclohexyl group ( 2t ) attached to the alkene was allowed , which led to a modest product yield in high enantioselectivity ( 98 : 2 e . r . ) . The incorpora - tion of an array of functional groups on the alkene was also toler - ated well . This includes various halides on the alkyl chain ( F , Cl and Br ( 2u – 2w ) ) and a tosylate group ( 2x ) , which are substrates that can be reactive under Pd catalysis 44 . These illustrative examples suggest that the current catalyst system is precisely tuned to engage with the alkenyl fluoride in the presence of reactive functionality . Additionally , an alcohol ( 2y ) , an ether ( 2z ) , a sulfone ( 2aa ) and an aniline ( 2ab ) were all competent substrates in this reaction . Simple basic amines were not compatible with the reaction , probably due to displacement of the chiral ligand , and styrenylfluorides did not undergo the reaction , presumably as a consequence of their mitigated nucleophilicity ( vide infra ( Supplementary Fig . 3 gives details ) ) . Of particular note , the enantioselectivity remained con - sistently high in all cases .

Specifically , the scope evaluation in Table 1 focuses on alkenyl fluorides that contain an allylic alcohol , which , by virtue of the reaction , forms an aldehyde product ( the aldehyde was reduced in situ with NaBH 4 to avoid decomposition issues associated with the isolation of the β - fluoro - aldehyde ) . By adding methylene units between the alcohol and the alkenyl fluoride , a successful reaction would offer a direct route to a remotely located fluorinated benzylic stereocentre ( Fig . 2a ) . In the event , a homoallylic alcohol underwent the desired reaction in reasonable chemical yields and consistently high enantioselectivity ( 3a – 3d ) .

NaTuRE ChEMiSTRY | VOL 11 | AUGUST 2019 | 710 – 715 | www . nature . com / naturechemistry 713 Articles NATure CHemisTry from the resulting alcohol functional group . Additional methylene units were incorporated from the pre - existing functional group as highlighted by 3e and 3f , which have four and six carbons between the installed stereocentre and the oxygen - containing functional group . Although poorer yields were observed for these cases , the enantioselectivity remained excellent . As described above , a key mechanistic question is : how does the reactivity of alkenyl fluorides compare to that of their non - fluorinated derivatives in terms of catalyst binding and migratory insertion aptitude ? To probe this question , several relative rate experiments were performed ( Fig . 2b – d ) . Experiments with equi - molar amounts of alkenyl fluoride 4a and disubstituted alkenol 4b and excess boronic acid were conducted under the optimal conditions identified for alkenyl fluorides ( Fig . 2b ) . The reac - tion progress showcases that the disubstituted alkenol 4b reacted significantly faster than alkenyl fluoride 4a ( Fig . 2c ) . Of particu - lar interest , 4b was nearly consumed prior to the reaction of the alkenyl fluoride , which suggests that migratory insertion is faster for the more electron rich alkene . Perhaps of greater interest is the experiment of equimolar amounts of 4c and 4d with excess boronic acid to evaluate the relative rates of a simple alkenyl fluo - ride ( 4c ) versus those of the trisubstituted alkene ( 4d ) in which , surprisingly , no Heck products were detected ( Fig . 2d ) . Note that trisubstituted alkene 4d , a competent substrate under previously reported reaction conditions ( 88 % yield ) 30 , does not react under the current conditions even in the absence of the alkenyl fluoride ( Supplementary Mechanistic Experiments gives details ) . Taken together , these results suggest that 4d , the trisubstituted alkene , is a considerably better ligand for the Pd catalyst , which thus inhibits the reaction of the alkenyl fluoride . Consistent with this hypoth - esis , substrates that contain competitive binding groups , such as a trisubstituted alkene ( 4e ) and a nitrile ( 4f ) , do not react under our current conditions , although other factors may contribute to their poor reactivity ( Fig . 2d ) . This information suggests that alkene binding to form intermedi - ate C is reversible after forming B via boronic acid transmetallation ( Fig . 2e ) . This hypothesis was developed on the basis of previous mechanistic studies 45 and the observation of poorer yields with less nucleophilic boronic acids . Thus , the faster - reacting alkene under - goes a turnover - limiting migratory insertion in C , which is probably under Curtin – Hammett control . Enantioselectivity is determined in this step , wherein the stereochemical model depicted in D showcases that the recognition element of carbon versus hydrogen on the proxi - mal alkene carbon , relative to the alcohol , defines the stereochemical outcome . In terms of the general reactivity of alkenyl fluorides , the results detailed above are consistent with the alkenyl fluoride being significantly less efficient at binding the catalyst than either simple di - or trisubstituted alkenes , with the latter acting as an inhibitor , probably as a result of the enhanced electron density of these alkenes . In contrast , the migratory insertion step is less sensitive to alkene electronics ; in fact , the alkenyl fluoride reacts significantly faster than the trisubstituted alkene under the reaction conditions . This observation suggests that the steric component of the alkene has the greatest impact on the consequential migratory insertion step . In this work , we describe a synthetic strategy to access enantio - merically enriched tertiary fluorides , which would be difficult to form using conventional approaches . The scope of the reaction is broad with uniformly high enantioselectivity . Remote tertiary fluo - ride stereocentres can be readily prepared with our strategy , which provides chemists with a new platform to explore fluorine - containing molecular scaffolds . Although halogens have often been leveraged as reactive functional groups in transition - metal - catalysed reactions that form C – C bonds , this report demonstrates that catalytic systems can be developed that retain the C – F bond . More broadly , we envi - sion that this work will inspire further investigation of the transition - metal - catalysed C – C bond - forming reaction previously developed for non - fluorinated alkenes with their fluorinated analogues as a means to forge stereocentres that contain C – F bonds . Methods In the general procedure for the enantioselective construction of remote tertiary C – F bonds , to a dry 5 ml Schlenk flask equipped with a stir bar was added Pd ( CH 3 CN ) 2 ( OTs ) 2 ( 10 . 6 mg , 0 . 020 mmol , 10 . 0 mol % ) , ligand ( 6 . 5 mg , 0 . 024 mmol , 12 . 0 mol % ) , dba ( 9 . 4 mg , 0 . 04 mmol , 20 mol % ) , 3 Å molecular sieves ( MS ) ( 50 . 0 mg , 250 mg mmol – 1 ) and MeOH ( 1 . 2 ml ) . To this flask , a three - way adaptor fitted with a balloon of O 2 was added , and the flask was evacuated via house vacuum and refilled with O 2 three times while stirring . The resulting mixture was stirred for 20 min . To this , a MeOH solution ( 0 . 8 ml ) of the fluorinated alkenyl alcohol ( 0 . 2 mmol ) and corresponding boronic acid ( 0 . 6 mmol , 3 equiv . ) was added by syringe . The resulting mixture was stirred for 72 h at room temperature ( r . t . , 25 °C ) . The mixture was transferred to a 10 ml scintillation vial equipped with a stir bar and a 5 ml Schlenk flask was washed by 2 ml MeOH added to the vial . Sodium borohydride ( 8 . 0 equiv . ) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h . The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel ( 1 : 20 acetone : hexane to 1 : 10 acetone : hexane ) to give the corresponding alcohol . Isolated yields were calculated based on the isolated mass . Full experimental details and characterization of the compounds are given in the Supplementary Information .
