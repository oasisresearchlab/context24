The recruitment of Ska , but not Dsn1 , to kinetochores requires charge in 40 - 60aa region of Ndc80 tail , related to Figure 3 . ( A ) Immunofluorescence staining of Ndc80 WT , Ndc80 + 4CT and Ndc80 + 4NT stable cell lines after depletion of endogenous Ndc80 shows reduced levels of Ska3 on prometaphase kinetochores of Ndc80 + 4CT stable cell lines , but not on the prometaphase kinetochores of Ndc80 + 4NT stable cell lines . Scale bar = 5 µm .

N / S - p = 0 . 84 ( Unpaired t - test with Welch ' s correction ) . ( C ) Immunofluorescence staining of Ndc80 WT and Ndc80 + 4CT stable cell lines after depletion of endogenous Ndc80 does not show significantly changed kinetochore levels of Dsn1 cells expressing Ndc80 + 4CT . Scale bar = 5 µm .

Figure S5 . Ndc80 + 4CT tail mutant is deficient in clustering on microtubules , related to Figure 5 . ( A ) Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of fluorescently labeled Ndc80 Bonsai + 4NT ( blue ) incubated with increasing concentrations of taxol - stabilized microtubules , plotted on log 10 scale ( mean ± SD ) . Hill equation was used for fitment of the data . Small graphs represent the data in the linear scale . ( B ) Representative projections ( same as in Figure 5 ) of 5 consecutive Z - sections ( 1 . 107 nm ) of the tomographic reconstructions show Ndc80 Bonsai + 4CT form smaller clusters than Ndc80 Bonsai WT . Black lines to indicate positions of Ndc80 molecules are omitted for clarity . SUPPLEMENTAL MOVIES Movie S1 .
