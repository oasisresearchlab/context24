LAT has also been associated with cholesterol - rich 23 condensed lipid domains . However , the potential coupling between protein condensation and lipid phase 24 separation and its role in organizing T - cell signaling were unknown . Here , we report that LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 25 condensates reconstituted on model membranes can induce and template lipid domains , indicating strong 26 coupling between lipid - and protein - based phase separation . Correspondingly , activation of T - cells induces 27 protein condensates that associate with and stabilize raft - like membrane domains . Inversely , lipid domains 28 nucleate and stabilize LAT protein condensates in both reconstituted and living systems . This coupling of lipid 29 and protein assembly is functionally important , since uncoupling of lipid domains from cytoplasmic protein 30 condensates abrogates T - cell activation . Thus , thermodynamic coupling between protein condensates and 31 ordered lipid domains regulates the functional organization of living membranes . 32 33 MAIN TEXT : 34 Spatial compartmentalization is a ubiquitous feature of living systems , with all life on Earth compartmentalized 35 by lipid membranes . Membranes can be further laterally sub - compartmentalized by self - organizing lipid 36 domains . For example , the intrinsic capacity of sterols and tightly packing lipids to preferentially associate into 37 liquid - ordered phases can produce liquid domains in biomimetic systems ( 1 - 3 ) , isolated plasma membranes 38 ( PMs ) ( 4 , 5 ) , and yeast vacuoles ( 6 , 7 ) . Micrometer - scale ordered membrane domains ( or “rafts” ) have not been 39 directly imaged in living mammalian cells , but accumulating evidence supports the involvement of nanometer 40 scale , dynamic lipid domains in signaling and trafficking ( 8 ) . 41 A conceptually analogous organizing principle is cytoplasmic compartmentalization via biomolecular 42 condensates , which concentrate molecules in the absence of an encapsulating membrane ( 9 , 10 ) . Similar to lipid 43 self - organization ( 11 ) , some condensates form through weak , multivalent interactions between 44 biomacromolecules , which drive liquid - liquid phase separation to produce dynamic mesoscale compartments 45 ( 10 ) . Condensates have become extensively implicated in cellular functions , including embryonic development 46 ( 12 ) , synaptic organization ( 13 , 14 ) , nuclear organization , gene regulation ( 15 , 16 ) , and signaling at the plasma 47 membrane ( PM ) ( 17 - 19 ) . A prominent example of the latter is the PM module consisting of LAT and two 48 cytoplasmic adaptors Grb2 ( growth factor receptor - bound ) and Sos1 ( son of sevenless ) , which links T - cell 49 immune receptor engagement with downstream pathways for activation ( i . e . proliferation , cytokine secretion , 50 etc . ) ( 20 ) . Interactions between LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 produce liquid condensates in reconstituted and living systems 51 ( 18 , 19 ) , which affect signaling by ( a ) concentrating reactants ( 18 , 21 ) ; ( b ) excluding negative regulators , e . g . 52 the phosphatase CD45 ( 18 ) ; ( c ) coupling to cytoskeletal dynamics ( 19 ) ; and ( d ) kinetically proofreading 53 activation ( 21 ) . 54 A central outstanding question concerns the biophysical and functional coupling between membrane lipid 55 domains and cytoplasmic condensates ( 22 , 23 ) . Lying near phase coexistence boundaries , both the PM ( 24 , 25 ) 56 and cytoplasm ( 9 ) appear poised for large - scale structural rearrangements , such that phase separation of one 57 could produce significant responses in the other . We hypothesized that LAT could produce such coupling , 58 because it participates in both cytoplasmic condensates via its disordered cytoplasmic tail ( 18 , 19 ) and ordered 59 lipid domains via its transmembrane helix ( 26 - 29 ) . Through a combination of in vitro reconstitution and cellular 60 experiments , we show that LAT condensates are thermodynamically coupled with ordered membrane domains 61 during T - cell activation , providing direct evidence of convergence between phase separation of membrane lipids 62 and protein condensation . We further show that this coupling is functionally important , as uncoupling abrogates 63 cell activation downstream of T - cell receptor engagement . These observations indicate that protein condensates 64 can regulate the functional organization of lipid membranes , and conversely , that lipid phase separation can 65 potentiate membrane protein condensation . 66 67 Mutual templating between protein condensates and membrane domains in vitro . Investigations of 68 membrane - associated protein condensates have often relied on planar lipid bilayers formed by fusion of 69 liposomes onto solid supports ( 18 , 19 ) . This method is not amenable for studying ordered membrane domains 70 because cholesterol - rich mixtures fuse poorly ( 30 ) and domain properties are severely affected by the solid 71 substrate ( 31 , 32 ) . To overcome these limitations , we generated phase - separating lipid multi - bilayers by spin - 72 coating mixtures of cholesterol , saturated phosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) , and unsaturated phosphatidylcholine 73 ( DOPC ) , which form dynamic , temperature - reversible liquid - ordered ( Lo ) and - disordered ( Ld ) domains ( 33 ) 74 ( Fig S1 ) . The phosphorylated intracellular domain of LAT ( pLAT ) was bound to the topmost leaflet of the multi - 75 bilayer through lipids with a His - chelating headgroup ( e . g . DSIDA , which concentrates in Lo domains ) ( 34 ) 76 ( Fig S2 ) . 77 As previously shown ( 18 , 19 ) , pLAT coupled to a DOPC membrane phase separates to form micron - sized 78 condensates within minutes of introduction of Grb2 + Sos1 ( Fig S3 ) ( throughout the text we invoke phase 79 separation for in vitro experiments where this mechanism of protein assembly has been clearly established and 80 the more generic ‘condensate’ for cellular results where the mechanism of assembly is less definitive ) . On more 81 biomimetic , phase - separated membranes , DSIDA - anchored pLAT was uniformly distributed in the Lo phase in 82 the absence of Grb2 + Sos1 ( Fig 1A , top ) , evidenced by its segregation from the Ld domain marker ( TR - DHPE ) 83 ( see figure legends and Supplementary methods for lipid and protein concentrations ) . Addition of Grb2 + Sos1 84 induced pLAT coalescence into large condensates that were exclusively overlying the Lo regions ( Fig 1A , 85 bottom ) . These condensate - rich regions existed alongside condensate - poor Lo regions , consistent with three - 86 phase ( condensate - rich Lo , condensate - poor Lo , and Ld ) coexistence predicted by recent theory ( 35 ) . 87 At this membrane composition , Lo domains comprise most of the bilayer area ; to determine whether 88 condensates could recruit Lo domains , the abundance of unsaturated DOPC was increased to produce Ld - 89 majority bilayers ( Fig 1B ) . In these , pLAT was confined to small Lo domains ( Fig 1B , top ) and addition of 90 Grb2 + Sos1 did not affect its superficial appearance ( Fig 1C , top ) . However , Grb2 + Sos1 did induce LAT 91 condensation , as evidenced by the persistence of the pLAT clusters upon melting of the underlying membrane 92 domains at 45°C ( Fig 1C , middle ) . This behavior contrasts with that of pLAT alone , which disperses together 93 with domains at 45°C ( Fig 1B , middle ) . When membranes were again cooled below the miscibility transition 94 temperature ( T misc ) , Lo domains reappeared exclusively beneath the pLAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates , but 95 randomly on bilayers containing only pLAT ( Fig 1B - C , bottom ) . These observations were mirrored when pLAT 96 was instead attached to the Ld phase ( Fig S4 ) . Thus , lipid domains and LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates can 97 mutually template each other’s localization and morphology . 98 We next tested how condensation would affect pLAT organization when monomers were not confined to a single 99 phase , but rather partitioned more like in isolated plasma membranes , where it is enriched by 20 - 50 % in the raft 100 phase ( 26 , 27 , 36 ) . To that end , pLAT was coupled to bilayers via a mixture of saturated ( DP - NTA ) and 101 unsaturated ( DO - NTA ) tail lipids . At a ratio of 2 : 1 DP - NTA : DO - NTA , pLAT partitioned to both phases with a 102 moderate preference for the Lo phase ( K p , Lo = 2 . 1±0 . 4 ) , Fig 1D , S5A - B ) , as in natural systems . Strikingly , 103 LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates were observable exclusively in the Lo phase ( Fig 1D ) . Even when condensates 104 formed in regions where Ld phases dominated , they appeared to induce the formation of small Lo domains ( Fig 105 S5A ) . We hypothesize that this high affinity of condensates for Lo domains is driven by oligomerization : the 106 partitioning free energy of individual LAT monomers ( into Lo ) is additive , meaning that partition coefficients 107 multiply such that K p , oligomer goes as K p , monomerN , where N = oligomer number . Thus , even for weakly partitioning 108 monomers , this exponential dependence on oligomer number would dramatically enhance partitioning for large 109 oligomers like condensates . 110 111 Figure 1 - in vitro coupling between protein condensates and membrane domains . ( A ) pLAT is uniformly 112 distributed in Lo domains in a phase separated membrane when conjugated to DSIDA . Addition of Grb2 / Sos1 113 produces protein condensates exclusively on top of Lo domains , i . e . completely excluded from Ld domains 114 ( marked by trDHPE ) . ( B ) Lo domains are present at 23°C and disperse at 45°C . ( C ) Condensates recruit nascent 115 Lo domains . LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates form in small Lo domains in majority - Ld membranes . Lipid domains 116 are dissolved by increasing temperature above the miscibility transition threshold ( ~ 37°C for this composition , 117 see Supp Methods for detailed lipid compositions ) ; pLAT condensates were not notably affected at these 118 temperatures . Cooling membranes below the transition temperature induces Lo domain formation exclusively 119 beneath protein condensates . ( D ) pLAT was bound to both phases by 2 % DP - NTA and 1 % DO - NTA in the 120 bilayer , yielding ~ 2 - fold Lo enrichment of LAT . Adding Grb2 / Sos1 produces condensates exclusively in the Lo 121 phase . ( E ) Protein condensates can induce lipid phase separation in GUVs . ( F ) Protein condensates enhance 122 lipid phase separation , evidenced by significantly increased T misc ( temperature at which 50 % of GUVs show lipid 123 phase separation ) . ( G ) Lipid phase separation facilitates protein condensation . Low concentrations of pLAT ( 20 124 nM ) , Grb2 ( 100 nM ) , and Sos1 ( 100 nM ) do not produce pLAT condensates on DOPC membrane ( left panel ) , 125 whereas the same protein mixture undergoes Lo - confined condensation on phase separated membranes ( right 126 panel ) . Scale bars are A / C / D / E / H = 5 µm , B = 2 µm . 127 128 Reciprocal stabilization between protein condensates and membrane domains . To investigate potential 129 thermodynamic coupling between protein phase separation and lipid phase separation , we measured the stability 130 of membrane domains in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles ( GUVs ) . GUVs composed of DOPC , DPPC , and 40 % chol 131 were not phase separated ( homogeneously distributed fluorescent lipids and DSIDA - coupled pLAT ) at 23°C 132 ( Fig 1E ) . As on supported bilayers , addition of Grb2 + Sos1 coalesced pLAT into condensates , but also induced 133 phase separation in the lipids , with complete segregation between an Ld phase marker ( trDHPE ) and protein 134 condensates ( Fig 1E , bottom ) . These observations suggest that protein condensates can stabilize membrane 135 domains , consistent with reports that clustering of membrane components can induce domain formation in 136 cholesterol - containing membranes ( 25 , 37 , 38 ) . To define the magnitude by which protein condensates 137 potentiated membrane phase separation , we measured condensate - dependent phase separation in GUVs ( Fig 1F 138 and S6 ) . At low temperatures , GUVs separate into coexisting Lo / Ld domains , which ‘melt’ ( i . e . become miscible ) 139 at higher temperatures . The temperature at which 50 % of vesicles are phase separated is defined as the 140 miscibility transition temperature ( T misc ) , which in the absence of LAT was 17°C . pLAT conjugated to the Lo 141 phase via DSIDA did not affect the thermotropic phase transition , whereas condensates induced by Grb2 + Sos1 142 increased T misc to 22°C ( Fig 1F and S6 ) , indicating robust regulation of lipid phase transition by LAT 143 condensates , as also recently reported ( 39 ) . Similar effects were observed when pLAT was initially coupled to 144 both phases via the mixture of saturated / unsaturated - lipid - NTA , as in Fig 1D ( Fig S5B - C ) . Thus , protein 145 condensates enhance membrane phase separation , likely via clustering domain - associated components , as 146 previously observed for membrane - bound actin filaments ( 40 - 43 ) , glycolipids ( 25 ) , and other condensing 147 proteins ( 39 , 44 ) . 148 Inversely , we predicted that enrichment of LAT into ordered domains , as believed to occur in living cells ( 27 , 149 29 ) , would increase its propensity to form condensates . We tested this prediction by lowering the concentration 150 of LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 to a regime where no condensates are observable on a uniform Ld membrane ( Fig 1G , left ) . 151 The same protein mix applied to a phase - separated membrane robustly induced condensates confined within Lo 152 domains ( Fig 1G , right , Fig S7 ) . Thus , protein condensates and membrane domains can reciprocally stabilize 153 each other , i . e . they are thermodynamically coupled . 154 155 Grb2 condensates recruit ordered membrane environments in cells . We next investigated coupling of 156 LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates with membrane domains in living cells . To induce LAT condensates , Jurkat T - cells 157 were activated by seeding onto coverslips coated with OKT3 , an α - CD3 antibody . Crosslinking of CD3 triggers 158 a signaling cascade that converges on LAT phosphorylation ( 45 ) , which in turn recruits Grb2 and Sos1 to form 159 cytoplasmic condensates analogous to those observed in vitro ( 18 ) ( Fig 2A - B ) . To evaluate the coupling of these 160 condensates with membrane domains , we employed genetically encoded probes that differentially partition to 161 membrane phases ( 26 , 27 , 36 ) . As reporters of ordered membrane regions , we used the transmembrane domain 162 ( TMD ) a - helix of LAT ( raft - TMD ) ( 26 , 27 , 36 ) or a saturated lipid - anchor ( GPI , glycophosphatidylinositol ) . To 163 mark disordered regions , we used a TMD consisting of 22 Leu residues ( nonraft - TMD ) ( 26 , 27 ) . All probes 164 were fused to fluorescent proteins for visualization and validated for expected raft affinity ( Table S1 ) . Grb2 165 condensates were coincident with regions of clear enrichment of the two raft probes ( raft - TMD and GPI ) and 166 were depleted of the nonraft - TMD ( Fig 2C - F ) . The magnitudes of enrichment / depletion were consistent with 167 previous reports for enrichment of raft - associated markers around activated immune receptors by super - 168 resolution localization microscopy ( 46 ) . Similar sorting of raft markers with Grb2 condensates was observed 169 by inducing condensates on non - activating surfaces ( ICAM1 ) with the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate ( Fig 170 S8 ) . Lipid fluorophores that selectively enrich in Lo or Ld domains were also sorted in accordance with raft 171 enrichment at condensates . ( Fig S9 ) . Thus , activation - induced protein condensates are co - localized with raft - 172 like membrane environments in living Jurkat T - cells , in agreement with reconstitution experiments . 173 174 175 Figure 2 - in situ recruitment of raft marker proteins to Grb2 condensates in cells .

Raft 189 probe enrichments were relatively subtle and only observable by using Grb2 condensates as fiducial markers , 190 putatively because the probes used all have relatively low selectivity for raft domains ( 26 , 36 ) . To more clearly 191 detect coupling , we relied on a previously described strategy to enhance probe raft affinity by oligomerization 192 ( 1 , 36 ) . To this end , we used antibodies to crosslink an endogenous T - cell raft component , the GPI - anchored 193 protein ( GPI - AP ) Thy1 ( 47 ) . The efficacy of this approach was confirmed in cell - derived Giant Plasma 194 Membrane Vesicles ( GPMVs ) , where primary antibody - crosslinked Thy1 had significantly higher raft phase 195 affinity than monomeric GPI - AP ( Fig 3A - B ) . Further clustering of Thy1 by secondary antibodies produced large 196 clusters that precluded accurate raft affinity measurements ; however , essentially all clusters were found in the 197 GPMV raft phase ( Fig 3A ) . 198 Consistent with our prediction that enhancing raft affinity would amplify colocalization with condensates , 199 dimerization of Thy1 by primary antibody significantly increased enrichment under Grb2 condensates generated 200 by TCR activation compared to monomeric GPI - AP ( Fig 3C - D ) . Further crosslinking by secondary antibody 201 produced Thy1 clusters that were strongly enriched in areas juxtaposed to Grb2 condensates ( Fig 3C - D ) . In live 202 cells , these Thy1 clusters rapidly diffused on the extracellular surface of the PM ( especially early in the 203 activation time course ) and were often observed stopping underneath Grb2 condensates ( Fig 3E , Supplementary 204 Movie 1 ) . We conclude that the multiplicity of saturated acyl chains ( previously estimated at ~ 20 proteins / cluster 205 ( 48 ) ) in these GPI - AP clusters enhances their affinity for transbilayer ordered membrane domains ( 1 ) , which 206 tend to be associated with , and immobilized by , Grb2 condensates ( Fig 3F ) . The recruitment of ordered domains 207 by LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates is directly analogous to our observations in reconstituted membranes ( Fig 1C ) . 208 Correspondingly , after TCR activation we also observed that membrane regions marked by Thy1 clusters could 209 nucleate Grb2 condensate formation ( Fig 3G , Supplementary Movie 2 ) . We hypothesize that these nascent 210 condensates were induced by enrichment of LAT in membrane domains ( 26 , 27 ) ( as in the reconstitution 211 experiment in Fig 1G ) , suggesting that cytoplasmic conditions are poised such that protein condensation can be 212 induced by localized protein concentration via lipid domains . 213 Following a similar strategy of enhancing raft affinity via oligomerization , we evaluated the effects of 214 crosslinking the prototypical raft lipid , cholesterol ( 8 ) . Cholesterol was modified with a biotinylated PEG - spacer 215 ( Fig 3H ) , relying on a strategy validated in design of other raft probes ( 49 , 50 ) . Labeling and crosslinking with 216 fluorescent avidin ( Av647 / Av488 ) confirmed that oligomerized cholesterol - PEG - biotin ( chol - PB ) enriches in 217 the ordered phase of GPMVs more strongly than monomeric chol - PEG - FITC ( Table S1 and Fig S11 ) . In PMs 218 of activated Jurkat T - cells , avidin - labeled chol - PB enriched in micron - sized domains ( Fig 3I - L ) . Strikingly , 219 Grb2 and LAT condensates were found exclusively overlying these cholesterol - rich regions ( Fig 3I , S12 ) , as 220 small foci distributed throughout relatively larger membrane domains . 221 Direct microscopic observations of cholesterol - rich domains in live cells were surprising , as raft domains have 222 largely evaded unambiguous microscopic detection ( 8 ) . These domains were initially observed by TIRF but 223 were also visible by epifluorescence ( Fig S13 ) and confocal ( Fig S14 ) imaging and were not membrane 224 accumulations or large invaginations / deformations ( Fig S13 - 15 ) . Most importantly , chol - PB domains 225 selectively recruited raft markers , including GPI - GFP ( Fig3J ) , glycolipid - binding cholera toxin B ( CTxB ) ( Fig 226 S16A ) , and Thy1 clusters ( Fig S17 ) , all of which enrich in rafts due to saturated acyl chains ( Table S1 ) . Chol - 227 PB domains also enriched raft - TMD and excluded nonraft - TMD ( Fig 3K - L ) . Another non - raft TMD , from the 228 immune cell phosphatase CD45 ( Table S1 ) , was also robustly excluded from chol - PB domains ( Fig S16B ) . 229 Broadly similar selective domains were also observed in Jurkat cells plated on fluid synthetic supported bilayers 230 ( Fig S18 ) . Thus , mesoscopic raft domains are strongly coupled to Grb2 / LAT condensates , revealing cooperative 231 templating between protein condensates and membrane domains in cells , directly analogous to reconstituted 232 systems ( Fig 1A - D ) . 233 234 Figure 3 – Mutual templating between Grb2 condensates and raft - like membrane domains . ( A ) Monomeric 235 GPI AP ( GPI - GFP ) is subtly enriched in raft phase of phase separated GPMVs . Dimerization of the endogenous 236 GPI - AP Thy1 increases raft preference .

Scale bars are 251 5 µm . Plots show normalized fluorescence intensity along the line traces . 252 253 Condensates stabilize cell membrane domains . Reconstituted condensates stabilize membrane domains in vitro 254 ( Fig 1E - F , S6 ) . We hypothesized that the microscopic raft domains revealed by chol - PB were potentiated by 255 condensation of raft - associated proteins ( i . e . LAT ) induced by T - cell activation . Consistently , micron - scale 256 cholesterol - rich patterns were only observable in activated Jurkat T - cells ( i . e . in presence of condensates ) , 257 whereas cells plated on a non - activating ( ICAM1 - coated ) surface were more laterally homogeneous ( Fig S19A ) . 258 The distribution of pixel intensities confirmed that OKT3 patterns were bimodal whereas ICAM1 were normally 259 distributed ( Fig S19B ) ; quantification by coefficient of variation ( CoV ) of chol - PB intensity revealed significant 260 differences between cell populations ( Fig S19B - inset ) , and there were robust spatial autocorrelations in chol - 261 PB intensity in activated Jurkat T - cells , compared to smaller scale and amplitude autocorrelations on ICAM1 262 ( Fig S20 ) . Thus , membrane - associated condensates reorganize the PM in live cells , enhancing the propensity to 263 form large cholesterol - rich lipid domains ( Fig 4H ) . 264 We further explored this effect by analyzing the dynamics of antibody - crosslinked Thy1 clusters as reporters of 265 membrane organization , with immobile clusters reflecting the presence of underlying ordered membrane 266 domains ( Fig 3E - G , as previously described ( 48 , 51 ) . Thy1 clusters were notably less dynamic in the presence 267 of LAT / Grb2 condensates ( i . e . in Jurkat T - cells activated by OKT3 ) , stalling frequently and for long periods , 268 compared to more mobile clusters in the absence of condensates on ICAM1 - coated coverslips ( Fig 4A , S21 ) . 269 The majority of Thy1 clusters in activated Jurkats were stalled for > 80 % of any individual track ( minimum track 270 length = 10 sec ) , whereas most clusters on ICAM1 - plated cells were either mobile throughout the tracking or 271 exhibited short , intermittent stalls ( Fig 4B , S21 , Supplementary Movies 3 & 4 ) . These observations suggest that 272 induction of condensates stabilized ordered membrane domains analogous to previous demonstrations of 273 crosslinking - induced domains in model membranes ( 25 , 37 , 46 ) or actin - asters associated with GPI - rich 274 domains in cells ( 43 ) . This induction and recruitment of membrane domains by LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates 275 may explain previous reports of selective enrichment of membrane raft markers around activated immune 276 receptors ( 46 , 52 , 53 ) . 277 278 Cell membrane domains potentiate condensates . Since lipid domains and protein condensates are coupled in 279 purified systems and living cells , we next tested whether perturbing membrane domains would affect 280 LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates in activated T - cells . Membrane domains can be disrupted by inhibiting synthesis 281 of raft - forming lipids using a combination of myriocin to inhibit sphingolipid synthesis and Zaragozic acid ( ZA ) 282 to inhibit cholesterol synthesis . This treatment disrupts raft - like nanodomains in cells ( 54 , 55 ) and inhibits 283 membrane phase separation in isolated GPMVs ( 56 ) without off - target effects on cellular phospholipid 284 composition ( 54 ) . Treatment with myriocin + ZA significantly reduced condensate density in Jurkat T - cells 285 activated by OKT3 ( Fig 4C ) . 286 Conversely , crosslinking of raft components has been shown to promote and stabilize membrane domains ( 25 , 287 48 , 57 ) ( Fig 1E - F ) . Consistently , crosslinking Thy1 with antibodies stabilized membrane domains in GPMV 288 experiments , indicated by increased lipid phase separation temperature ( T misc ) ( Fig 4D , Fig 4H right ) . 289 Remarkably , stabilizing cell membrane domains without any other activating stimulus was sufficient to produce 290 cytoplasmic protein condensates . Plating Jurkat cells labeled with anti - Thy1 antibodies onto 2°Ab coated 291 coverslips to crosslink the GPI - anchored protein induced Grb2 condensate formation ( Fig 4E ) . No condensates 292 were observed in absence of GPI crosslinking ( on 1°Ab - coated coverslips ) nor in the absence of LAT ( i . e . LAT - 293 deficient Jurkat line , JCam2 . 5 ) . Condensates induced by GPI - AP crosslinking were able to activate MAPK 294 signaling , revealed by immunostaining against phosphorylated ERK ( pERK ) ( Fig 4F - G ) . These results suggest 295 that stabilizing membrane domains can induce condensate formation and downstream T - cell activation , even in 296 the absence TCR , mediated by LAT coupling between membrane domains and condensates . Several groups 297 have previously reported that crosslinking GPI - APs or raft glycolipids can activate T - cells without TCR ligation 298 ( 39 , 48 , 58 , 59 ) . Here , we show that LAT ( as a transmembrane link ) is necessary and suggest a mechanism for 299 these puzzling findings , i . e . that stabilizing rafts potentiates protein condensates ( Fig 4H ) that facilitate T - cell 300 signaling ( 21 ) . 301 302 Uncoupling of membrane domains from protein condensates abrogates T - cell activation . Our observations 303 suggest that coupling to membrane domains underlies the formation and location of protein condensates . 304 Condensates have been previously implicated in T - cell signaling and activation ( 18 , 21 ) . Therefore , we 305 hypothesized that coupling between domains and condensates might be important in T - cell function . We tested 306 this hypothesis by uncoupling domains from condensates via two mutations of their critical linker LAT : ( 1 ) 307 replacing the native LAT TMD with non - raft TMD ( 22 Leu ) ( 26 , 27 ) ( Table S1 ) to create ‘nonraft LAT’ that still 308 interacts with Grb2 but does not partition to raft domains or ( 2 ) mutating LAT’s 3 Tyr residues to Ala to create 309 non - pY LAT , which can partition to rafts but cannot interact with Grb2 . Fluorescence - tagged versions of these 310 mutants ( or wild - type LAT ) were stably introduced into LAT - deficient Jurkat T - cells , and their capacity to 311 facilitate T - cell activation was monitored by immunostaining against phosphorylated ERK ( pERK ) after plating 312 on OKT3 . JCam2 . 5 cells stably re - expressing wt - LAT showed strong pERK staining compared to the LAT - 313 deficient negative controls ( selected negative cells marked by asterisks in Fig 4I ) . In contrast , neither nonraft - 314 LAT nor non - pY LAT showed pERK activation above LAT - deficient cells ( Fig 4I and S22 ) . Consistently , LAT - 315 containing condensates were only observed in wt - LAT cells ( Fig 4I , right ) . Cells expressing wt - LAT had ~ 4 - 316 fold higher pERK signal than those expressing nonraft - LAT ( Fig 4J ) . Importantly , these results were 317 independent of PM LAT expression ( Fig 4K ) and even LAT phosphorylation ( Fig S23 ) , all of which were similar 318 between wt - LAT and nonraft - LAT expressing cells . Thus , we conclude that coupling of membrane domains and 319 cytoplasmic condensates via LAT is essential for activating signaling downstream of TCR ligation . 320 321 Synthesizing these observations , we find strong coupling of cytoplasmic protein condensates with lateral 322 membrane domains in reconstituted models and in living Jurkat T - cells ( Fig 4H ) . LAT condensates recruit 323 specific lipids and proteins to their adjacent membrane by interactions between the LAT transmembrane domain 324 and raft components ( 26 , 27 ) . LAT condensation stabilizes microscopic membrane domains ( Fig 1E , 3H - L , 4A - 325 B , S16 , S19 , 4H left ) , consistent with prevailing models of mammalian PMs containing dynamic nanodomains 326 poised for coalescence by external inputs ( 60 ) . Correspondingly , raft domains can nucleate and potentiate 327 cytoplasmic condensates ( Fig 1G , 3G , 4H right ) . Uncoupling LAT from rafts abrogates condensation and ERK 328 activation downstream of TCR ligation . Therefore , we conclude that protein phase separation is 329 thermodynamically and mechanistically coupled to lateral phase separation of membrane lipids to regulate the 330 functional organization underlying immune cell signal transduction . 331 332 Fig 4 – Protein condensates potentiate membrane domains . ( A ) 8 representative > 10 sec tracks of Thy1 333 clusters from a cell plated on either OKT3 ( left ) or ICAM1 ( right ) . ( B ) Trajectories of 2° antibody - crosslinked 334 Thy1 clusters were calculated through single particle tracking ( 30 - 100 tracks / cell ; five cells / condition ) . Each 335 track was classified as either mobile ( < 20 % of the track time stalled ) , start - stop ( 21 - 79 % stalled ) , or stalled ( ≥80 % 336 stalled ) . Shown are percentages ( mean + / - st . dev . ) of each class of track across individual cells . ( C ) Inhibition 337 of raft - forming lipids perturbs Grb2 condensate formation . Grb2 - mScarlet - expressing Jurkat T - cells were 338 incubated with 25 µ M myriocin and 5 µ m Zaragozic acid for 3 days to deplete cells of lipids necessary for raft 339 formation ( e . g . sphingomyelin and cholesterol , respectively ) as previously described ( 54 ) . Cells were then plated 340 on OKT3 - coated coverslips for 10 minutes at 37°C , fixed , then imaged via TIRF microscopy . Shown is 341 condensate density for 3 experiments with > 5 cells / experiments . * * * p < 0 . 001 for differences between 342 experiments . ( D ) T misc is higher in GPMVs with 2° - antibody - crosslinked Thy1 , indicating increased raft stability . 343 ( E ) Grb2 - scarlet transfected cells imaged via TIRF 20 min after plating . 2°Ab - coated coverslips crosslink 1°Ab - 344 labeled endogenous Thy1 , which is sufficient to induce condensates in Jurkat T - cells , but not in LAT - deficient 345 cells ( JCam2 . 5 ) . Scale bar = 10 µm . ( F ) LAT - deficient cells ( marked with asterisks ) were mixed with LAT - positive 346 Jurkat T - cells ( labeled with Grb2 - mScarlet ) and cell activation induced by Thy1 crosslinking by 2°Ab - coated 347 coverslips was examined by pERK immunostaining . Thy1 crosslinking induced pERK , but not in LAT - deficient 348 cells . Scale bar = 10 µm . LAT - deficient cells served as internal negative control for IF staining and imaging .

LAT - deficient JCam2 . 5 cells were mixed with cells stably repleted with either wt , non - raft , or non - pY 356 LAT and plated on OKT3 for 10 mins . Only wt - LAT repleted cells formed LAT condensates and had pERK 357 staining above LAT - deficient negative controls ( selected LAT - deficient cells marked with asterisks ) .

( A ) pLAT is uniformly 494 distributed in Lo domains in a phase separated membrane when conjugated to DSIDA . Addition of Grb2 / Sos1 495 produces protein condensates exclusively on top of Lo domains , i . e . completely excluded from Ld domains 496 ( marked by trDHPE ) . ( B ) Lo domains enriching pLAT are present at 23°C and disperse at 45°C , then reappear 497 randomly after cooling . ( C ) Condensates recruit nascent Lo domains . LAT / Grb2 / Sos1 condensates form in small 498 Lo domains in majority - Ld membranes . Lipid domains are dissolved by increasing temperature above the 499 miscibility transition threshold ( ~ 37°C for this composition , see Supp Methods for detailed lipid compositions ) ; 500 pLAT condensates were not notably affected at these temperatures . Cooling membranes below the transition 501 temperature induces Lo domain formation exclusively beneath protein condensates . ( D ) pLAT was bound to 502 both phases by 2 % DP - NTA and 1 % DO - NTA in the bilayer , yielding ~ 2 - fold Lo enrichment of LAT . Adding 503 Grb2 / Sos1 produces condensates exclusively in the Lo phase ( labeled by naphthopyrene , blue ) . ( E ) Protein 504 condensates can induce lipid phase separation in GUVs . ( F ) Protein condensates enhance lipid phase 505 separation , evidenced by significantly increased T misc ( temperature at which 50 % of GUVs show lipid phase 506 separation ) . ( G ) Lipid phase separation facilitates protein condensation . Low concentrations of pLAT ( 20 nM ) , 507 Grb2 ( 100 nM ) , and Sos1 ( 100 nM ) do not produce pLAT condensates on DOPC membrane ( left panel ) , 508 whereas the same protein mixture undergoes Lo - confined condensation on phase separated membranes ( right 509 panel ) .

( A ) Monomeric 525 GPI AP ( GPI - GFP ) is subtly enriched in raft phase of phase separated GPMVs . Dimerization of the endogenous 526 GPI - AP Thy1 increases raft preference . Further oligomerization of Thy1 via secondary antibodies leads to 527 exclusively raft - associated clusters . Scale bar is 5 µm .

( A ) 8 representative > 10 sec tracks of Thy1 544 clusters from a cell plated on either OKT3 ( left ) or ICAM1 ( right ) . ( B ) Trajectories of 2° antibody - crosslinked 545 Thy1 clusters were calculated through single particle tracking ( 30 - 100 tracks / cell ; five cells / condition ) . Each 546 track was classified as either mobile ( < 20 % of the track time stalled ) , start - stop ( 21 - 79 % stalled ) , or stalled ( ≥80 % 547 stalled ) . Shown are percentages ( mean + / - SD ) of each class of track across individual cells . ( C ) Inhibition of 548 raft - forming lipids perturbs Grb2 condensate formation . Grb2 - mScarlet - expressing Jurkat T - cells were 549 incubated with 25 µ M myriocin and 5 µ m Zaragozic acid for 3 days to deplete cells of lipids necessary for raft 550 formation ( e . g . sphingomyelin and cholesterol , respectively ) as previously described ( 54 ) .

Thy1 crosslinking induced pERK , but not in LAT - deficient 558 cells . Scale bar is 10 µm . LAT - deficient cells served as internal negative control for IF staining and imaging . ( G ) 559 Quantification of pERK activation by Thy1 clustering in LAT - deficient JCam2 . 5 cells ( green ) versus LAT - 560 expressing Jurkat cells ( red ) . ( H ) Schematic model of condensate - domain coupling . ( left ) Clustering LAT by 561 intracellular condensates enhances LAT recruitment into membrane domains and promotes their coalescence . 562 ( right ) Clustering raft components stabilizes membrane domains to potentiate LAT condensation . ( bottom ) Both 563 processes result in an activated state where membrane - associated condensates template and stabilize raft - like 564 membrane domains . ( I ) Coupling of protein condensates and lipid domains through LAT is necessary for pERK 565 activation . LAT - deficient JCam2 . 5 cells were mixed with cells stably repleted with either wt , non - raft , or non - pY 566 LAT and plated on OKT3 for 10 mins . Only wt - LAT repleted cells formed LAT condensates and had pERK 567 staining above LAT - deficient negative controls ( selected LAT - deficient cells marked with asterisks ) . Scale bar is 568 15 µm ( left ) and 5 µm ( right ) . ( J ) Quantification of pERK in raft versus non - raft LAT repleted cells . Scale bar is 569 15 µm . ( J ) pERK intensity as a function on LAT on the PM . Mean ± SD of individual cell quantifications shown 570 in G , J - K for one representative experiment . Three independent experiments were performed with similar results . 571
