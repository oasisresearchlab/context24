To understand the relationship between these two phe - nomena and the dynamic regulation of genes in response to upstream signals , we describe the use of live - cell RNA imaging coupled with Hi - C mea - surements and dissect the endogenous regulation of the estrogen - responsive TFF1 gene . Although TFF1 is highly induced , we observe short active periods and variable inactive periods ranging from minutes to days . The heterogeneity in inactive times gives rise to the widely observed ‘‘noise’’ in human gene expression and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue . We derive a mathematical model of regulation that relates transcription , chro - mosome structure , and the cell’s ability to sense changes in estrogen and predicts that hypervariabil - ity is largely dynamic and does not reﬂect a stable biological state . INTRODUCTION There has been tremendous progress in the development of methodologies to interrogate gene expression in single cells , including in situ imaging and single - cell RNA sequencing ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) . These data demonstrate the vast diversity in gene expression programs present in multicellular organ - isms . The differences are due to programmed specialization , which arises during differentiation , but also due to random pro - cesses that result in heterogeneity within a population of cells in a tissue . This latter phenomenon , sometimes called ‘‘noise’’ in gene expression , is a consequence of the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions . However , to what extent does hetero - geneity in gene expression reﬂect stable sub - populations of cells or simply a transient state ? Understanding the dynamic nature of gene expression is essential for interpreting single - cell expression studies and understanding how cells function in a tissue . Quantitative measurements of RNA and protein in single cells have suggested several underlying principles of non - genetic het - erogeneity . First , heterogeneity can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic noise , depending on whether ﬂuctuations are speciﬁc to individual genes or experienced across many genes ( Elowitz et al . , 2002 ; Xu et al . , 2017 ) . Second , the primary contribution to intrinsic noise is transcriptional bursting ( the period of RNA synthesis activity during which multiple polymerases initiate , separated by inactive periods ) , which has been observed from bacteria to humans ( Lenstra et al . , 2016 ) . Third , intrinsic noise can be buffered by transcription from multiple alleles and down - stream RNA processing , such as splicing , export , and decay , which can smooth out ﬂuctuations by time averaging ( Battich et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , regardless of the type of noise ( intrinsic or extrinsic ) or the source ( transcriptional or post - transcriptional ) , the resulting heterogeneity can be ergodic or non - ergodic . If vari - ation is ergodic , then each cell samples the entire possibility of states . To interrogate human gene dynamics , we chose the estrogen response in mammary epithelial cells , which has served as a transcriptional paradigm for decades ( Masiakowski et al . , 1982 ; May and Westley , 1987 ) . The response is rapid and wide - spread ; within 40 min of estradiol ( E2 ) treatment , hundreds of genes are activated or repressed ( Hah et al . , 2011 ) . Transcrip - tional activation is regulated through the estrogen receptor ( ER ) , which binds estrogen response elements ( EREs ) located proximally and distally of putative target genes ( Fullwood et al . , 2009 ) . However , the role of chromosome structural changes in response to a stimulus is unclear . Many enhancer - promoter con - tacts are pre - formed and become stronger with hormone addi - tion ( Hakim et al . , 2011 ; Stavreva et al . , 2015 ) , but topological domain boundaries remain largely unchanged ( Le Dily et al . , 2014 ) . Acute depletion of CCCTC - binding factor ( CTCF ) and cohesin results in loss of domains but only modest changes in gene expression ( Nora et al . , 2017 ; Rao et al . , 2017 ) . However , hormone - responsive contacts without CTCF binding may be more relevant for stimulus - dependent regulation ( D’Ippolito et al . , 2018 ) . Overall , it is unknown how the estrogen response regulates the intrinsic dynamics of endogenous genes , how these dynamics are modulated by genome architecture , and Cell 176 , 213 – 226 , January 10 , 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc . 213 how individual cells harness these dynamics to sense estrogen levels . We take an integrated approach based on single - molecule im - aging , perturbation of cis - and trans - acting regulatory factors , and genome - wide chromosome conformation capture ( Hi - C ) . We used CRISPR / Cas9 to integrate 24 MS2 repeats into multiple endogenous TFF1 loci in human breast cancer cells , enabling live - cell imaging of TFF1 transcription in real time . We ﬁnd that TFF1 expression variability comes from long stochastic repres - sive periods for individual alleles that can last more than 16 hr , even while other alleles in the same nucleus are active . We iden - tify a cohort of secreted and signal peptide genes that show extreme expression heterogeneity ( (cid:1) 100 - fold ) in human and mouse tissue , indicating that long stochastic repressive periods are present in speciﬁc gene ontology categories . In competition with this repressive process is a phenomenon we call ‘‘coupled intrinsic noise , ’’ whereby transcription of one allele makes transcription of another allele more likely . Finally , we derive a mathematical model of TFF1 transcription that inte - grates dynamics , allele coupling , and genome - wide chromo - some conformation . RESULTS Live - Cell Imaging of Endogenous TFF1 Transcription Reveals Estrogen - Regulated Inactive Periods and a Deep Repressive State To observe regulation of endogenous alleles in single cells , we targeted the estrogen - responsive TFF1 gene in MCF7 cells for hCas9 - mediated integration of 24 MS2 stem loops into the 3 0 UTR ( Figure 1A ) . As the MS2 loops are transcribed , the stably integrated GFP - MS2 coat protein speciﬁcally binds to the RNA loops , enabling live - cell visualization of RNA at the site of tran - scription ( Janicki et al . , 2004 ) . We employed a screening strategy that allowed the detection of positive clones as correctly inte - grated alleles yield double - band PCR amplicons ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . Addition of E2 after hormone depletion of the TFF1 - MS2 clonal cell line showed strong induction ( Figure 1D ) , similar to that observed with the unedited parental cell line . This cell line contains a total of ﬁve TFF1 alleles , three of which are labeled with MS2 ( Figures 1E and S1A – S1C ) . Individual cells showed multiple TFF1 transcription sites ( transcription sites [ TSs ] simul - taneously in the same cell ; Figure 1F ; Videos S1 and S2 ) , and in - dividual RNAs could be observed diffusing in the nucleus ( Video S3 ) . In summary , we labeled three TFF1 alleles at the endoge - nous loci in human cells , and these alleles show a robust response to E2 and can be imaged with single - molecule sensitivity . Live - cell imaging under saturating estrogen conditions indi - cates that RNA synthesis is both sporadic and discrete ( Video S4 ) . To quantify this active / inactive behavior , we tracked TSs and measured the ﬂuorescence intensity over time ( Larson et al . , 2011 ; Figures 1G and S1D ) . The duration of active periods is narrowly distributed with a mean of 16 . 0 ± 0 . 5 min ( Figure 1H , SEM ) . However , the duration of inactive periods is broadly distributed , with some alleles inactive for more than 12 hr ( Fig - ures 1I and 1J ) . The long periods of inactivity constitute a persis - tent transcriptionally repressive state for single alleles , even when other alleles in the same nucleus are active . Moreover , alleles can be silent for long periods of time and then show intense activity , indicating that long off periods are neither a sta - ble property of the cell nor the allele . Periods of activity reﬂect both the time that the promoter is transcriptionally ‘‘active’’ ( the interval over which nascent tran - scripts are initiated ) and the dwell time of RNA ( elongation , cleav - age , and release of nascent transcripts ) ( Coulon et al . , 2014 ) . To separate , we use transcription ﬂuctuation analysis ( Coulon and Larson , 2016 ; Ferguson and Larson , 2013 ; Larson et al . , 2011 ) with hidden Markov analysis . The transcription bursts are stitched together into one contiguous intensity trace ( Figures S1D – S1F ) . The analysis indicates that the initiation rate is 0 . 5 ± 0 . 02 min and that the dwell time of the nascent RNA is 13 . 0 ± 0 . 8 min ( Figure S1G ) . Therefore , the time the promoter is active is 3 . 0 ± 1 . 0 min , and the measured ‘‘burst’’ size ( RNA per active period ) is 1 . 5 ± 0 . 5 transcripts . Given the highly uniform nature of the bursts for all cells at a given dose , we asked how transcription and cellular mRNA change with E2 concentration . We measured a steady - state dose response by single - molecule ﬂuorescence in situ hybridi - zation ( smFISH ) ( Figures 2A , 2B , S2A and S2B ) and obtained a half maximal effective concentration ( EC 50 ) of 0 . 02 ± 0 . 01 nM ( Figure 2C , SEM ) , agreeing with previous results ( 0 . 02 – 0 . 05 nM ; May and Westley , 1987 , 1988 ) ) . The number of nascent RNA molecules at the TS was 1 . 67 ± 0 . 02 ( Figures S2C and S2D ) and did not change with E2 dose ( Figure S2E ) . We performed live - cell imaging at doses of 0 . 05 nM and 0 . 5 nM and typical MCF7 culture conditions , corresponding to the EC 50 , saturation , and beyond saturation , respectively . Under these conditions , TFF1 - MS2 and the parental cell line have similar mRNA per cell distributions and fraction of cells transcribing ( 28 % ± 1 % and 19 % ± 2 % ; Figures S2F and S2G ) . We observed no signiﬁcant difference between active period durations ( Figure 2D ) . However , inactive period dura - tions differed between doses ( Figure 2E ) . Under complete me - dium or 0 . 5 nM , TFF1 bursts every 66 ± 7 and 86 ± 18 min , respectively . In contrast , near EC 50 , TFF1 bursts every 185 ± 34 min . Thus , E2 regulates the periods of inactivity ( the fre - quency of TFF1 activation ) . Surprisingly , some cells do not contain any mRNA , even in the highest E2 concentrations ( 100 nM ) ( Figures 2A , 2B , 2F , S2A and S2B ) . These cells are true non - expressers for TFF1 because a housekeeping control with a similar mean number of mRNAs per cell in the same cells showed a normal distribution ( CTNNBL1 ; Figures 2B and 2F , inset ) . Although some cells ex - press more than 500 mRNAs per cell at saturation , the mode is 0 mRNA per cell , and the distribution is monotonically decaying for all E2 concentrations . This result is even more striking consid - ering that , for a cell with zero TFF1 mRNA , none of the 5 alleles have transcribed within the half - life of TFF1 message , which is (cid:1) 43 . 5 hr ( Schueler et al . , 2014 ) , consistent with a long or ‘‘deep’’ repressive state . Activation and Re - initiation Are Coordinately Regulated To understand how different factors contribute to the TFF1 response , we ﬁrst deleted a region of the proximal enhancer in the TFF1 - MS2 cell line with CRISPR / Cas9 ( Figure 2G ) .

Cell 176 , 213 – 226 , January 10 , 2019 215 TFF1 proximal enhancer is located 10 kb upstream and contains binding sites for ER and the cofactors FoxA1 and GATA3 ( Carroll et al . , 2005 ; Hurtado et al . , 2011 ) . This deletion removes the cofactor binding sites but leaves a crucial ERE intact and results in diminished transcriptional activity ( Pan et al . , 2008 ) . We iso - lated a deletion mutant ( Figure 2H ) and imaged the cells under saturation conditions . We observe a slight difference in distribu - tion of the active times ( p < 0 . 0003 , Kolmogorov - Smirnov [ KS ] test ) , and a pronounced difference in the inactive distribution ( p < 8e (cid:3) 5 , KS test ) ( Figures 2I and 2J ) . The enhancer deletion mutant bursts every 126 ± 27 min , in contrast to the parental line , which bursts every 66 ± 7 min . These data indicate that the enhancer primarily modulates how frequently TFF1 is activated .

Targeting TRIM24 with the chemical inhibitor MD9571 , which blocks bromodomain binding to acetylated his - tones ( Palmer et al . , 2016 ; Tsai et al . , 2010 ) , we measured a non - monotonic dose - dependent change in TFF1 mRNA levels by smFISH with an (cid:1) 3 - fold reduction at 0 . 5 m M MD9571 ( Figure 3A ) . CTNNBL1 mRNA levels were marginally reduced . At this dose , the on time decreased to 10 . 2 ± 0 . 5 min ( Figure 3B ) , and the off times were unchanged ( Figure 3C ) . As validation , we measured the intensity of the TS with smFISH to the TFF1 intron ( Figures 3D and 3E ) . TSs in treated cells are as abundant but dimmer and rarely show the bright spots indicative of multiple RNAs at the locus . Taken together , our data indicate that the TFF1 enhancer determines when the gene ﬁres , but when initia - tion occurs , binding of the ER co - activator TRIM24 is required for multiple re - initiation events . Alleles in the Same Nucleus Are Dynamically Coupled To address whether the variability in transcriptional activity is due to differences between cells , we plotted the summed RNA output of single TFF1 alleles ( the integrated area under 216 Cell 176 , 213 – 226 , January 10 , 2019 the transcription time series ) against the summed output of other TFF1 alleles in the same cell ( Figure 4A ) . The output of TFF1 alleles in the same cell are correlated ( Pearson correlation coefﬁcient [ r ] = 0 . 65 ± 0 . 08 SEM , p = 3 . 8e (cid:3) 10 ) whereas pairs of alleles from different cells are not ( Figure 4B ) . Likewise , the number of bursts was also correlated ( r = 0 . 48 ± 0 . 10 SEM , p = 1 . 2e (cid:3) 5 ) ( Figure 4C ) . Some cells show only a single burst over the entire time course ( Figure 4D , top ) , whereas others are highly active ( Figure 4D , center ) . Alleles can also show dif - ferential behavior , reinforcing the notion that extended off pe - riods are not a consequence of cell state ( Figure 4D , bottom ) . At ﬁrst glance , our data suggest a signiﬁcant amount of extrinsic noise . We tested this by measuring correlations be - tween individual bursts . Inter - allele cross - correlation computed from background - corrected traces ( Figures S3 and S4 ; STAR Methods ) showed signiﬁcant positive correlation between alleles only within the same nuclei ( Figure 4E ) . When one allele ﬁres , there is a 27 % ± 3 % greater chance that another allele will ﬁre within the next 2 hr than expected by random chance ( STAR Methods ) . G ab ( t ) ( cross - corelation function ) depends on the number of bursts from each allele and the fraction of bursts that coincide over the observation period . Several simpliﬁed scenarios are shown schematically ( Figure 4F ) . The cross - corre - lation has a long decay and depends on the spatial separation between alleles , meaning that there is often a delayed correlated burst that is not visible in snapshots of nascent RNA ( Figures 4G and S5 ) . In summary , alleles show spatio - temporal correlations that have not been considered previously in models of gene regulation . control 0 . 5 uM MD9571 0 . 5 uM MD9571 control TFF 1 RN A / c e l a v e r age 0 0 . 05 0 . 5 5 . 0 Trim24 inhibitor ( nM ) Inactive duration ( hours ) Active duration ( minutes ) TS brightness ( a . u . ) CD F CD F CD F A B C D E 2 0 4 8 10 6 12 14 15 0 30 45 60 50 0 100 150 200 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 control0 . 5nM MD9571 control0 . 5nM MD9571 control0 . 5nM MD9571 Figure 3 .

A Mathematical Model of TFF1 Transcription Relates Transcription Dynamics , Expression Heterogeneity , and Protein Distribution in Human Tissue We next addressed possible kinetic models that could explain the dynamics of TFF1 transcription and steady - state levels of TFF1 mRNA . The standard two - state telegraph model ( Ko , 1991 ; Peccoud and Ycart , 1995 ) does not describe a distribution of off times with a long tail and also does not directly consider RNA synthesis dynamics captured by the on time distribution . To address these limitations , we developed a general and comprehensive model of gene activity that can be compared with both off and on time ( mRNA synthesis ) dynamics as well as steady - state mRNA levels provided by smFISH . The model is fully stochastic and consists of an arbitrary number of ‘‘gene states’’ and ‘‘RNA steps . ’’ The standard telegraph model is a subtype of this model with two gene states and no RNA steps . The gene states repre - sent regulatory features underlying transcription before one observes RNA at the TS . Figure 5A shows an example with 3 gene states and 2 RNA steps . One of these gene states is active ( labeled X ) , where transcription can be initiated , whereas the rest ( labeled Y and Z ) are ‘‘inactive . ’’ As pre - mRNA is being synthe - sized , it remains attached to chromatin , undergoing a series of transitions such as elongation and release . Allele coupling occurs through a simple mechanism whereby , whenever any allele is in the active state ( state X ) , the forward rate to the active state from the penultimate state ( state Y ) is immediately increased for all other alleles in the cell by a ﬁxed coupling rate . The inﬂuence of E2 concentration is modeled by a change to one of the rates . The number of gene states , RNA steps , E2 effect , and rate parameters are determined by Bayesian model comparison ( Figure S6 ; Methods S1 ) . The model that best ﬁt the data under all conditions while penalizing for model complexity using Bayesian and Akaike Cell 176 , 213 – 226 , January 10 , 2019 217 information criteria ( Bayesian information criterion [ BIC ] , Akaike information criterion [ AIC ] ) consisted of three gene states and two RNA steps ( Figure 5A ; Table S1 ) . The two predicted RNA steps indicate that either zero , one , or two RNA molecules can be present at the TS during a burst , consistent with the direct observation ( Figure 1 ) . Rate parameters for the top model and agreement between the model , live - cell data , and smFISH are shown in Figures 5C and 5D . Three features of the model re - vealed mechanistic insight . First , the model predicts that E2 con - centration controls the occupancy probability of gene state X ( Figure 5E ) ; the forward and backward rates between the gene states X and Y had the lowest BIC and AIC values , with the forward rate slightly favored ( Figure 5E ) . Likewise , the enhancer deletion also perturbs transitions between X and Y . In contrast , TRIM24 inhibition alters the initiation rate ( n 1 ; Figure 5a ) . Second , the model predicts that the forward rate out of the most inactive state , Z , is extremely long ( (cid:1) 23 days ; Table S1 ) . This timescale is much longer than the observation time of 14 hr and is an extrapolated timescale based on the shape of the inactive time distribution . Last , a single coupling parameter explains the burst correlation between alleles ( Figure 5F ) , which could not be ex - plained with coupling at other steps . Mechanistically , E2 levels and the cis - acting enhancer only affect Y to X transitions but have no direct effect on the deep repressive Z state , which is the dominant source of heterogeneity in mRNA levels . As a validation of the model , we independently tested whether each allele visits all states . It is possible that there are stable populations of fast bursters and slow bursters or a continuum of ﬁxed behaviors that appear as distinct states after ﬁtting . To address this , we looked for transitions between dynamic regimes in single trajectories . A single trajectory that obeys a ﬁxed rate constant will obey a Poisson process , with a coefﬁcient of variation ( CV = s / mean ) for the off times equal to 1 . A trajectory where a hidden transition occurs will show a CV > 1 . Experimental examples are shown in Figures 5G – 5J . For each measured allele , we computed the CV for off times and binned these data into a histogram ( Figure 5K , red ) .

We then tested model predictions in gene expression hetero - geneity for protein distribution in human tissue . We analyzed immunohistochemical staining of TFF1 in ﬁxed tissue from small intestine , duodenum , and breast cancer and observed the same striking degree of expression heterogeneity in both differentiated and undifferentiated tissues ( Figures 5L and S6 ) . We quantita - tively compared the decile distribution of TFF1 protein staining intensity with the decile distribution of mRNA per cell from smFISH ( Figure 5M ) . There is a linear relationship between TFF1 protein and TFF1 mRNA but not between TFF1 protein and CTNNBL1 mRNA ( Figure 5M , inset ) , indicating that the empirical probability distribution of mRNA in MCF7 cells predicts the distribution of protein in multiple human tissues . Secreted and Signal Peptide Genes Are Variably Expressed Our data indicate that TFF1 exhibits a deep repressive state that is largely responsible for the observed expression heterogeneity . We determined the generality of the deep repressive state with other genes by identifying genes that were variable in MCF7 sin - gle cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA - seq ) data ( Rothwell et al . , 2014 ) . Because TFF1 has a long RNA half - life , we postulated that genes with both high variability in scRNA - seq expression and long RNA half - lives would be enriched in genes with a deep repressive state . Because the dataset was small , we considered expressed genes ( > 3 reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads [ RPKM ] ) with a long RNA half - life ( Schueler et al . , 2014 ) ( > 1 , 000 min ) and sorted the list by CV . TFF1 is ranked highly and is also the top variable gene when considering a measure of dispersion for a normal distribution ( Fano factor ; Table S2 ) . Surprisingly , we observed that the top quintile was enriched in certain gene functional categories : secretion , transmembrane , and signal peptide ( Figure 6A ) . TFF1 is among these genes as a secreted peptide that is part of the mucosa . We performed a similar gene ontology analysis on a large pub - lished dataset of scRNA - seq from the mouse small intestine ( Haber et al . , 2017 ) and identiﬁed the most signiﬁcant variable genes ( q value < 0 . 05 ) . As expected , we observed that variably expressed genes are enriched in the ‘‘cell cycle’’ category in all three subtypes ( Figure 6B ; Benjamini p < 1e (cid:3) 6 ) . We also observed the ‘‘hormone’’ category enriched in goblet and enter - oendocrine cells . Importantly , we observed that secreted and signal peptide genes are among the top most enriched category in the variable genes ( Figure 6B , asterisks ) , suggesting a func - tional role for expression variability in ‘‘secreted’’ and ‘‘signal peptide’’ genes . We next validated four estrogen - responsive candidate genes ( Hah et al . , 2011 ; Massot et al . , 1985 ) from the MCF7 ranked list via smFISH in MCF7 cells under saturating E2 conditions ( Tables S3 and S4 ) . We observed broad gene expression hetero - geneity for 3 of 4 candidates ( AGR2 , SERPINA3 , and CA12 ; Figures 6C and 6D ) . Surprisingly , co - hybridization with TFF1 re - sulted in poor RNA correlation , indicating that hypervariable ER target genes show response heterogeneity even in the same cell . We next applied our model to the RNA histograms in conjunction with published RNA half - lives ( Schueler et al . , 2014 ) and predicted inactive times for individual alleles of 5 to 16 days ( Figure 6D , right ) . In summary , our analysis identiﬁes a conserved relationship between variable gene expression and secreted and signal peptide genes . Transcription Dynamics and Genome Architecture Can Be Connected through the Concept of Entropy Live - cell imaging , smFISH , and scRNA - seq all point to the exis - tence of multiple off states , one of which is a deep repressive state associated with certain gene ontology categories . Because the hypervariable genes are estrogen - responsive , and because estrogen induces changes in enhancer - promoter contacts ( Car - roll et al . , 2005 ; Pan et al . , 2008 ) , we measured genome - wide chromosome conformation changes in response to E2 . We per - formed three - enzyme ( 3e ) Hi - C ( Ren et al . , 2017 ) at three different E2 doses ( 0 nM , 0 . 05 nM , saturated [ Sat . ] E2 ; 2 biolog - ical replicates ) and recapitulated the characteristic contact maps observed for Hi - C ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . We observed a mono - tonic decrease in long - range genome - wide contacts in response to increasing E2 doses ( Figure 7A ) . Upon closer inspection , we observed that topologically associated domains ( TADs ) appear denser in contacts overall ( Figure 7C ) , as reported recently ( Vian et al . , 2018 ) . We also observed increases in off - diagonal contact frequency , characteristic of deﬁned enhancer - promoter interactions ( Figure 7D ) . However , many EREs did not show such obvious enrichments between two speciﬁc regions but , rather , increasing contact probability with multiple parts of the chromo - some and a concomitant loss of contacts with many other regions . We quantitatively capture this behavior using Shannon en - tropy as a measure of the contact frequency distributions . Shan - non entropy is deﬁned as (cid:3) P p log p , where p is the probability of contact between two regions and is related to the fraction of ligation reads ( STAR Methods ) , and the sum is over all pairs of regions ( Figure 7E ) . We applied this measure genome - wide to raw count interaction matrices ( 100 - kb bins ) obtained from Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif Enrichment ( HOMER ) . The raw counts were normalized by converting interaction counts into probability distributions so that the sum of probabil - ities across a single row of the raw count matrix is equal to 1 ( excluding the identity bin ) . There was a global but non - uniform decrease in entropy in response to E2 ( Figure S7 ) . We observed decreases in entropy in the regions immediately ﬂanking TFF1 on chromosome 21 ( chr21 ) ( Figure 7F , right ) but not two bins up - or downstream . We then looked only at the entropy of over 700 enhancers that are bound by ER and exhibit enhancer transcrip - tion ( Hah et al . , 2013 ) . Because these enhancers are much smaller ( deﬁned as 2 kb ) than the 100 - kb bin size used above , we used 1 - kb bin raw count matrices . The entropy of ER - bound enhancers decreases from 3 . 5 ± 0 . 03 bits to 2 . 8 ± 0 . 06 bits ( Fig - ure 7G , SEM ) , indicating that ER enhancers have less entropy or more speciﬁc contacts in the presence of E2 . However , the ma - jority of EREs do not approach the limit of an exclusive , highly speciﬁc contact . To put this quantitative entropy change in a biological context , we compute the mutual information ( MI ) ( Shannon , 1948 ) , which is the difference between the entropy measured 220 Cell 176 , 213 – 226 , January 10 , 2019 from all conditions versus dose - stratiﬁed conditions . MI is the measure of how much information about the E2 dose is en - coded in chromosomal contacts . The MI , determined from the changes in enhancer entropy with E2 , is 2 . 5 ± 0 . 05 bits ( SEM ) . This value means that each cell is capable of distinguish - ing 2 2 . 5 or (cid:1) 5 . 6 ‘‘levels’’ of E2 . Conversely , an experimental method for reading out the contact map of all EREs would allow an external observer to distinguish the level of E2 to an error of (cid:1) 1 . 2 nM . Thus , MCF7 cells contain sufﬁcient information in their estrogen - dependent contacts genome - wide to distinguish gra - dations in E2 level . How can these data be reconciled with estrogen - dependent changes in transcription ? On one hand , we have the static genome - wide contact probabilities , and on the other hand , we have a dynamic model applied to single genes . Shannon entropy can be measured directly in the former case and computed from the kinetic model in the latter case , based on the steady - state occupancy of the states ( Figure 5A ) .

Therefore , we hypothesize that the gene states depend in part on changes in chromosome conformation ( e . g . , enhancers interacting with promoters versus enhancers interacting with other parts of the genome ) . To account for the fact that EREs make ubiquitous contacts with different parts of the chromosome before E2 addition , we consider a Z state that is composed of many energetically degenerate states , either with fast kinetic transi - tions between them or each connected directly to the Y state with similar kinetics . This modiﬁcation does not change the kinetic structure ( Figure 5A ) or time - resolved predictions for single - molecule data but , rather , introduces the possibility of ‘‘hidden’’ Z states to better reﬂect the 3e Hi - C data . The predicted Shannon entropy from the kinetic model can then be written as S = (cid:3) p X log p X (cid:3) p y log p y (cid:3) p Z log ð p Z = m Þ ; ( Equation 1 ) where p i is the model - estimated probability of state i , and m is the number of equally probable hidden Z states . For the contact entropy of 2 . 8 bits in the high - dose state , this predicts 5 hidden Z states . Thus , even a relatively low number of hidden Z states recapitulates the entropy , as measured by 3e Hi - C and pre - dicted from the single - molecule time - lapse data . Finally , we use MI to quantitatively address how estrogen levels are reﬂected in single - gene transcription , which encom - passes not only structural changes visible by 3e Hi - C but also chromatin modiﬁcations , transcription factor occupancy , RNA polymerase transitions , etc . Because individual TFF1 bursts are highly similar , the information content is in the time interval between two bursts , and the MI between burst interval and E2 dose is 0 . 13 bits . To reach 1 bit , which allows an input and output device to distinguish between off and on , requires approximately 8 bursts . Therefore , to determine whether estrogen is present from the response of TFF1 , the sumof bursts from all TFF1 alleles in the nucleus must be around eight , and to sense gradations in estrogen level requires a greater number of bursts . DISCUSSION We have shown how human bursting dynamics are inﬂuenced by cis - and trans - acting factors and physiologically regulated by changes in chromosome structure that occur in response to estrogen stimulation . We ﬁnd that noise in gene expression is driven by long repressive states that are randomly occupied by individual alleles and are not a property of the cell as a whole . Extreme heterogeneity ( > 500 fold for TFF1 mRNA ) is also identiﬁed in single - cell RNA - seq , present in functionally related classes of genes , and visible at the protein level in both differentiated healthy tissue and undifferentiated human tumors . However , this heterogeneity is a dynamic phenomenon that likely does not reﬂect a stable biological state or cellular subtype . The heterogeneity we measure both in transcription dynamics and chromosome conformation places limits on the ability of a cell to decode upstream signals , such as estrogen concentration . The Role of Intrinsic Noise in Expression Heterogeneity Stochastic variation in gene expression has typically been attrib - uted to large bursts of transcription whereby many RNA are initiated in rapid succession . However , despite showing tremen - dous variability in gene expression , the TFF1 burst size is small , resulting in only 1 – 2 RNAs per burst . Moreover , this small burst size is conserved between yeast ( Lenstra et al . , 2015 ) , humans ( this study ) , and in vitro ( Revyakin et al . , 2012 ) , leading us to speculate that transcriptional bursts are structurally or mecha - nistically constrained . One such factor that allows for re - initiation of TFF1 transcription is the tripartite motif containing the protein TRIM24 , which has a modest effect on mRNA levels ( (cid:1) 2 - to 3 - fold ) because it only changes the burst size but not the frequency of bursting . Previous reports of large burst sizes or burst modulation ( Golding et al . , 2005 ; Tantale et al . , 2016 ) may be due to terminology and / or experimental time resolution . For example , if one deﬁnes a burst as the time the gene spends in the X and Y states combined , then the burst size is (cid:1) 65 RNAs . For the TFF1 gene , the large variation in mRNA levels arises not from large bursts but through two reinforcing processes . First , alleles can transition into a long repressive state that is highly variable and ranges from more than 14 hr to 23 days . Although E2 increases the burst frequency of TFF1 , as seen for other enhancer - driven genes ( Bartman et al . , 2016 ; Fritzsch et al . , 2018 ; Fukaya et al . , 2016 ; Larson et al . , 2013 ; Skinner et al . , 2016 ) , the long repressive state is unresponsive . In fact , alleles spend the majority ( > 60 % ) of the time in this repressive state . Second , when an allele begins making RNA , other alleles in the same nucleus are more likely to become active . Thus , stochastic effects become ampliﬁed . We call this latter process coupled intrinsic noise and distin - guish it from previous models of expression variability ( Fig - ure 5B ) . Historically , stochastic variation has been divided into extrinsic noise and intrinsic noise based on measurements of inter - versus intra - cell variability ( Elowitz et al . , 2002 ) . Any varia - tion that affects transcription of all alleles in the cell and is manifested as a distribution along the diagonal of the scatterplot ( Figure 4A ) would be attributed to extrinsic noise . For example , variation in ER expression might result in a lineage of cells that always has higher levels of bound estrogen and consistently higher activity of TFF1 . Variation perpendicular to the diagonal could then be construed as intrinsic noise arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical interactions . Even when both alleles see the same effective concentration of ER and all other activators and repressors , there will still be differences in the ﬁring of the alleles because of Brownian diffusion . In the model of coupled intrinsic noise , a stochastic event at one allele— post - translational modiﬁcation of an activator or repressor , gen - eration of a non - coding RNA , etc . —can subsequently affect the activity at another allele . Speciﬁcally , our data suggest that acti - vation of one allele leads to an increased probability of activation of other alleles in the same nucleus . Dynamics , Architecture , and Information Transfer in Gene Regulation Because EREs are often distally located from the genes they regulate , we carried out 3e Hi - C in MCF7 cells under the same dose and culture conditions we used for imaging . These Cell 176 , 213 – 226 , January 10 , 2019 223 measurements revealed E2 dose - dependent changes in chro - mosome contacts , such as a decrease in long range contacts and a concomitant increase in density associated with TAD - like structures near the diagonal . We observed clear formation of some de novo loops , but the majority of EREs do not form exclusive contacts with distal parts of the chromosome . In summary , these data agree with previous measurements that show both a strengthening of existing loops ( D’Ippolito et al . , 2018 ; Hakim et al . , 2011 ; Stavreva et al . , 2015 ) or an increase in TAD density after transcriptional activation ( Vian et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , the conceptual framework of information theory enables a direct comparison with live - cell single - molecule transcription data . The kinetic model that describes our time - resolved data consists of states with rates of transition between them . At any point in time , the gene exists in a certain gene or RNA state , and the fractional occupancy over time is precisely what is quantiﬁed by the Shannon entropy . There is a striking concordance between the entropy changes inferred from our model and the actual entropy changes determined from the contact map . Although any model is necessarily a reductionist exercise , and the states in the model could correspond to alter - nate aspects of transcription , we favor the interpretation that the X and Y states correspond to different chromosome confor - mations , with other molecular changes acting downstream of this conformation change . This interpretation is the simplest one that explains our experimental data in its totality , including the dose response , perturbations of cis - and trans - acting fac - tors involved in estrogen regulation , correlations between al - leles and other genes , and 3e Hi - C data . The corollary to this interpretation is that the Z state reﬂects the many non - speciﬁc contacts that can sequester an enhancer from a particular promoter . The role , if any , of hypervariability is still a subject of specula - tion . We ﬁnd that single cells are quite capable of accurate sensing of estrogen through the information contained in ERE contacts . However , the output of transcription for TFF1 ( as rep - resented by RNA synthesis ) is much less informative . Because of stochastic variability , information transfer between the upstream signal and downstream output is remarkably inefﬁcient and slow ( (cid:1) 0 . 002 bits / min for TFF1 ) , despite a robust dose response . Conversely , information transfer in single - cell eukaryotes can be an order of magnitude faster ( Hansen and O’Shea , 2015 ) , indi - cating that there is nothing mechanistically limiting in chromatin remodeling or the transcriptional machinery . One explanation may lie in the observation that this hypervariable expression associated with the deep repressive state occurs for genes func - tionally associated with secretion . Perhaps , in an organismal context , there is a physiological beneﬁt for cells to sense and respond to many inputs as a tissue rather than in a cell - autono - mous fashion .

This media is denoted in the text as complete media or Saturated E2 . The cell lines TFF1 - MS2 and TFF1 - MS2 - D12 enhancer deletion are derived from this MCF7 parental clone . They were grown in the same conditions . METHOD DETAILS Treatment vehicles E2 was dissolved in 100 % ethanol and maintained at (cid:3) 20C . MD9571 was dissolved in DMSO . Gene editing Experiments were performed on low passage MCF7 cells from ATCC . The donor construct was initially constructed by the Protein Expression Laboratory ( NCI Frederick National Laboratory ) and subsequently modiﬁed to increase the number of MS2 loops to 24 . The genomic integration site was chosen in the middle of the TFF1 3 0 UTR . The donor construct consisted of left and right homology arms each spanning (cid:1) 1kb , screening primer sequences , 24 MS2 stem loops , and a PGK - Puromycin - polyA gene ﬂanked by FRT sites . Guide RNAs were designed using the website http : / / zlab . bio / guide - design - resources . A guide RNA targeting the 3 0 UTR was cloned into pX330 - U6 - Chimeric _ BB - CBh - hSpCas9 ( PX330 ) ( Cong et al . , 2013 ) using the standard 1 - page protocol . ( http : / / www . addgene . org / crispr / zhang / ) . All guide RNA sequences used in this study were cloned into PX330 ( Table S3 ) . Cells in 6 well plates were transfected with equal amounts of the donor construct and the guide RNA / Cas9 construct using TransfeX ( ATCC ) . The manufacturer’s protocol was followed . Puromycin was added to the cells 7 days post transfection until cell death of control plate completed . Cells were grown until near conﬂuency and plated at low dilution for single cell colony formation on 15 cm dishes . A 96 well plate was also plated for single cell colony formation . Colonies were marked and transferred to 96 well plates with cloning cylinders . Screening Strategy Two primers which ampliﬁed the endogenous locus and were located outside of the homology arms were incorporated into the donor construct adjacent to each homology arm ( Table S3 ) . Correctly integrated clones will therefore amplify two smaller amplicons , as well as the larger unedited amplicons . 79 % ( 115 of 145 ) of single cell colonies contained double bands . Clone cA7 contained the correct 24 MS2 stem loop PCR amplicon size ( (cid:1) 1 . 4kb ) . PGK - PURO - pA removal A guide RNA was designed to the ﬂanking FRT motifs of the donor construct . cA7 cells in 6 well plates were transfected using TransfeX reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol for MCF7 cells . Cells were plated at low dilution for single cell colony formation on 15cm dishes . Cells were maintained in complete media until visible colonies were observed . Colonies were marked and transferred to 96 well plates using cloning cylinders . Colonies were expanded onto 48 well plates , then replica plated onto 12 mm No . 1 . 5 glass coverslips . Clones were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) and screened with smFISH ( see below ) using probes to the puromycin RNA and MS2 repeat RNA . The clone c17 ( cA7c17 ) did not contain puromycin spots . MS2 - GFP MS2 - GFP was stably integrated into cA7c17 cells in 12 well dishes using lentiviral delivery of MS2 - GFP under the control of a ubiquitin promoter as previously described ( Larson et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were transduced in a 12 well plate by incubating in serum free media for 30 min and subsequently incubated with several dilutions of MS2 - GFP lentivirus in serum free media supplemented with 2 m g / ml polybrene . Plates were tilted every 15 - 20 min for 2 hr in cell culture incubator . Full media was then added to cells and replaced every two days . Lentivirus was prepared by NCI Frederick National Laboratory . This ﬁnal cell line was subsequently used for live cell experiments ( TFF1 - MS2 ) . CRISPR enhancer deletion Two guide RNAs were constructed to delete 798bp of the TFF1 upstream enhancer ( Table S3 ) . TFF1 - MS2 cells in 6 well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Invitrogen ) using the standard protocol and equal quantities of the two guide RNA plasmids . 3 days after transfection , cells were plated at low dilution for single cell colony formation . 216 colonies were transferred to 96 well plates , and subsequently replica plated . Genomic DNA was extracted with the Z96 Zymo genomic DNA kit . PCR ampliﬁcation of the deletion region was performed using Quickload mastermix ( NEB ) . 4 of 192 surviving clones contained deletion bands . The cA5 clone was used for live cell imaging , and designated as clone TFF1 - MS2 - D12 . smFISH and DNA FISH Probesets were designed with ‘‘Oligo’’ software ( Table S3 ) and ordered from Biosearch Stellaris using Quasar 570 and 670 dyes . TFF1 ( 16 probes ) and CTNNBL1 ( 48 probes ) mRNA probe sets were designed to the exons common between all Refseq isoforms . TFF1 intron probesets ( 79 probes ) were designed using the genomic sequence of the ﬁrst intron . Puromycin screening probesets ( 22 probes ) were designed using the donor construct plasmid sequence . MS2 probsets ( 2 probes ) were designed from the linker e2 Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 regions between the repeats . CA12 , SERPINA3 , CTSD , AGR2 smFISH probesets were designed using Stellaris Probe Designer ( https : / / www . biosearchtech . com / stellaris - designer ) with the following parameters : masking level at 5 , oligo length 20 , minimum spacing of 2 nucleotides . 48 , 35 , 27 , and 27 probes were ordered from Biosearch Stellaris in Quasar 670 for CA12 , SERPINA3 , CTSD , AGR2 respectively . smFISH was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol with minor modiﬁcations . Cells grown on 18mm No . 1 . 5 coverslips in 12 well plates were washed 3 times with HBSS before ﬁxation with 4 % PFA in PBS . Fixed samples were washed with 1X PBS , and stored in 70 % ethanol at 4C overnight . Hybridized samples were mounted in Prolong Gold with DAPI and allowed to dry overnight . DNA FISH was done as previously described ( Meaburn and Misteli , 2008 ) . Brieﬂy , FISH probes to the TFF1 promoter and the down - stream region were generated through nick translation of BAC ( CTD - 2652C12 and CTD - 3095D11 , respectively ) in the presence of ﬂuorescently labeled UTP ( Dy490 and Dy 540 obtained from Dynomics ) . The probes were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in hybridization buffer ( 10 % [ wt / vol ] dextran sulfate [ Sigma - Aldrich ] , 50 % [ vol / vol ] formamide [ Sigma - Aldrich ] , 2 3 SSC , and 1 % [ wt / vol ] Tween 20 [ Sigma - Aldrich ] ) in the presence of 3ug of human COT - 1 DNA and 20ug ) . Cells grown in 384 well plate were ﬁxed with 4 % PFA and treated in the following order for FISH : washed with PBS ( 3X ) , permeabilized with 5 % triton / 0 . 5 % Saponin / PBS for 20 min , washed again with PBS ( 3X ) , treated with 0 . 1N HCl for 15min , washed with 2X SSC and incubated with 50 % Formamide / 2XSSC for at least 30 min . Cells were then incubated with the FISH probes at 85 (cid:4) C for 7 . 5 min and moved to a 37 (cid:4) C water bath over - night . The probed were removed and the cells washed in the following order : 3X 5 min 1XSSC at 42 (cid:4) C 3X 5 min 0 . 1XSSC at 42 (cid:4) C . The nuclei were stained with DAPI . Induction and dose response Cells for smFISH were plated on glass coverslips and allowed to recover for 2 days . For induction and dose response experiments , cells were subsequently hormone depleted by washing cells twice in Phenol free media supplemented with 10 % Charcoal / Dextran Treated FBS ( Atlanta Biologicals ) , 2mM Glutamine and 1X Penstrep ( hormone depleted media ) . Cells were returned to incubator and an hour later media was replaced . This step was performed again . After 4 days , media was replaced with hormone depleted media supplemented with the speciﬁc concentration of E2 . Cells were allowed to reach steady state and ﬁxed with 4 % PFA three days later . MD9571 treated cells for smFISH experiments were treated for 2 days in complete media before ﬁxation . Cells for live cell imaging were plated onto Labtek Chambered # 1 . 0 dishes ( 155380 ) . For MEM ( saturating E2 conditions ) , cells were allowed to recover for 2 days . Media was then replaced with Phenol free MEM media supplemented with 10 % FBS , 2mM Glutamine and 1X Penstrep . For dose response experiments , cells were washed twice with hormone depleted media , and returned to the incubator . After 4 days , media was replaced with hormone depleted media and supplemented with speciﬁc E2 concentration . Media was replaced 3 days later . Imaging started the next day and continued for the following two days . MD9571 treated cells for live cell imaging were immediately imaged for 14 hr upon addition of MD9571 . Microscopy Imaging of FISH was performed on two custom built microscopes . Dose response smFISH data were acquired on a custom - built microscope . The microscope consisted of a Zeiss AxioObserver , Zeiss 63x C - Apochromat objective , Hamamatsu ORCA - R2 C10600 camera , and Zeiss Colibri with LEDs for 365nm , 530nM , 630nM for DAPI , Quasar 570 and Quasar 670 excitation respectively . Emission ﬁlters speciﬁc to these spectra were also used . The microscope was controlled by Micro - Manager ( Edelstein et al . , 2010 ) . Several ﬁelds were imaged with Z stacks spanning 7 microns at 0 . 5 micron intervals . The maximum intensity projections were performed and used for analysis . The image acquisition for the number of active alleles per cell ( Figure S1 ) and the TFF1 - MS2 induction were performed on a custom - built microscope . This microscope consisted of an ASI ( www . asiimaging . com ) Rapid Automated Modular Microscope Sys - tem ( RAMM ) base , Hamamatsu ORCA - Flash4 V2 CMOS camera ( https : / / www . hamamatsu . com / , C11440 ) , Lumencore SpectraX ( https : / / lumencor . com / ) , ASI High Speed Filter Wheel ( FW - 1000 ) , ASI MS - 2000 Small XY stage . Excitation of DAPI , Quasar 570 , and 670 was performed using SpectraX violet , red , and green respectively . Emission ﬁlters speciﬁc to these spectra were used . A quad bandpass ﬁlter was used for the TFF1 - MS2 induction . The ﬁlter wheel with speciﬁc channel bandpass ﬁlters was used for the TFF1 allele number data acquisition . Image acquisition was performed through Micro - Manager . We obtained multiple z stacks at 0 . 5 micron intervals , spanning 10 microns . The maximum intensity projections were performed and used for analysis . The number of cells used per sample used for the analysis ranged from 700 - 3400 cells . The smFISH dose response data were replicated twice in the laboratory on two separate days . The control data for the number of active TFF1 alleles and the MS2 induction comes from 1 experiment each . MD9571 experiment imaging spanned 7 microns . Live cell imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM780 laser scanning confocal microscope using 37C incubation and 5 % C02 . Imaging was performed using 488 nm excitation , pinhole size of 10 , zoom of 0 . 8 at 1024x1024 , pixel size of 0 . 16 microns , and power of 1 for all data except the enhancer deletion which required power of 1 . 5 . 5 ﬁeld of views were taken at a time . Z stacks were acquired spanning 7 . 5 microns at 0 . 5micron intervals ( 16 Z planes ) . Imaging of Z stacks occurred every 100 s for 512 frames ( 14 . 2hrs total ) . The maximum intensity projections were performed and used for analysis . The number of alleles used for the analysis is as follows : 100 for saturating E2 , 33 for 0 . 5nM , 17 for 0 . 05nM , and 28 for the deletion mutant at saturating E2 . The live cell data for the MEM and enhancer deletion data come from 10 ﬁelds of view on 2 different days . The dose response data were each acquired on 1 day each . Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 e3 Confocal imaging of the diffusing RNA was performed with the same microscope using pixel size of 0 . 04 microns , pinhole size of 1 and 6 % power . One z plane was imaged every 200ms for 256 frames . The movie was bleach corrected using the FIJI and the bleach correction plugin with exponential ﬁt correction . Three - enzyme Hi - C ( 3e Hi - C ) : Cells were grown in 10cm dishes and treated as above in the dose response smFISH except cells were ﬁxed as previously described for 3e HiC ( Ren et al . , 2017 ) . Cells were cross - linked with 1 % formaldehyde for 10 min at 25 (cid:4) C . 2 - 5 X 106 cells were lysed in 10 mL lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 10 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % NP40 ; 10 m L protease inhibitors ( Sigma ) ) with rotation at 4 (cid:4) C for 60 min . The cells were then treated with 400 m L 1X NEB cutsmart buffer with 0 . 1 % SDS at 65 (cid:4) C for 10 min , followed by addition of 44 m L 10 % Triton X - 100 to quench SDS . Chromatin was subsequently digested with 20 Units CviQ I ( NEB ) , and 20 Units CviA II ( NEB ) at 25 (cid:4) C for 20 min , then with 20 Units Bfa I ( NEB ) at 37 (cid:4) C for 20 min . The reaction was stopped by washing the cells twice with 600 mL wash buffer ( 10mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % triton - 100 ) . The DNA ends were blunted and labeled with biotin by Klenow enzyme in the presence of dCTP , dGTP , dTTP , biotin - 14 - dATP , followed by ligation using T4 DNA ligase . After reverse crosslinking , the samples were treated with T4 DNA polymerase to remove biotin labels at the DNA ends . DNA was fragmented to 300 - 500 bp by sonication with a Bioruptor sonicator ( Diagenode UCD - 200 ) . Next , The DNA was end - re - paired , followed by A - addition as described previously ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) . The remaining biotinylated DNA fragments were then captured using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavin C1 Beads ( Invitrogen ) by incubating for 30 min at 25 (cid:4) C with rotation . The DNA on beads was ligated to the Illumina Paired End Adaptors . Following PCR - ampliﬁcation of the libraries , DNA fragments from 300 to 700 bp were puriﬁed from 2 % E - gel and sequenced on Hi - Seq 3000 . Two biological replicates were sequenced on a HiSeq 3000 , and (cid:1) 62 million reads / sample were mapped by bowtie 2 - 2 . 3 . 4 using ‘‘bowtie2 - p 10 (cid:3) 3 0 – local - x genome fastqﬁle‘‘ . Data were further processed by HOMER 4 . 8 . 2 in order to remove small fragment self - ligations and to generate raw - unnormalized and normalized matrices ( - norm HOMER option ) . The HOMER programs and param - eters used were the following : ‘‘makeTagDirectory unﬁltered _ sample samﬁle _ read1 , samﬁle _ read2 - tbp 1 , ’’‘‘makeTagDirectory ﬁlter - ed _ sample - update - genome hg19 - removePEbg - removeSpikes 10000 5 , ’’‘‘analyzeHiC ﬁltered _ sample - res resolution - raw - cpu 16 - pos chr : s - e’’ Where resolution was 100000 or 1000 , and chr = chromosome , s = start , e = end . ’’ Raw count matrices were exported into text ﬁles using HOMER and used for the entropy analysis . In addition , 2887regionswere reported as showing increased contacts and 5023 were reported as showing decreased contacts between Sat . E2 and 0nM using interactions found in both replicates with Z - scores of at least 3 and HOMER 4 . 10 . Although there were fewer interactions identiﬁed with 4 . 8 . 2 , the raw count matrices extracted with both HOMER versions on the HOMER 4 . 8 . 2 ﬁltered data yielded the same entropy values . Figures Figures were generated in FIJI , R ( https : / / www . r - project . org / ) , matplotlib ( https : / / matplotlib . org / ) and Adobe Illustrator . Figure 2 genome browser view was generated using the genome . ucsc . edu PDF tool and subsequently modiﬁed in Adobe Illustrator . Visualization of chromosome contact matrices was performed with HiCPlotter ( Akdemir and Chin , 2015 ) using the probability distributions . We also plotted the HOMER normalized output ( - norm option ) of a select region on chromosome 21 using Treeview . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Shannon Entropy and Mutual Information To compute Shannon entropy and mutual information for the 3e Hi - C data , we divided each chromosome into 100kb segments and counted the number of contacts in each segment - segment bin to obtain a contact probability between each segment . The Shannon entropy of a contact given dose d is given by S ð C j D = d Þ = (cid:3) X i p i ð d Þ log p i ð d Þ ( Equation 1 . 1 ) where p i ( d ) is the probability of a contact ‘‘bin’’ at a given dose d and the sum is over all bins . The log is always base 2 so the result is in bits . Entropy was also calculated for a list of previously identiﬁed ER enhancer locations which span 2kb ( Hah et al . , 2013 ) . A 1kb bin matrix around each 2kb enhancer was output using HOMER yielding a multi - bin x 2 column matrix . These 2 columns were consol - idated by summing the raw counts . The self - bins containing the enhancer were not considered . The mutual information is deﬁned as the difference between the total entropy regardless of dose and conditional entropy ( i . e . , the average of the dose entropies condi - tioned on dose ) : MI = S ð C Þ (cid:3) X d p ð d Þ S ð C j D = d Þ ( Equation 1 . 2 ) where p ( d ) is the probability of dose d , which we took to be 1 / 3 . e4 Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 For the inter - burst mutual information , we computed the OFF - time probability density in closed form from the model ( see section on General Telegraph Model ) for each dose and computed the corresponding Shannon entropy via R 24 hrs 0 (cid:3) p ð t Þ log p ð t Þ dt for each condition . Variable gene analysis MCF7 single cell data were obtained from GEO accession GSE52716 ( Rothwell et al . , 2014 ) . Genes with a minimum of 3RPKM average over all cells and with a mappable MCF7 RNA half - life from ( Schueler et al . , 2014 ) were considered as the expressed background set . From this list , genes with half - lives greater than 1000 min ( > 16hrs , top quarter ) were subsequently considered for potential variable candidates . The data were sorted by descending CV and the top quintile was used for DAVID GO analysis ( https : / / david . ncifcrf . gov / ) . Candidates for smFISH were selected by sorting by the Fano factor , and selecting four from the top 20 . Small intestine single cell data from the large cell sort of ( Haber et al . , 2017 ) was obtained from GEO accession GSE92332 . Data for cells identiﬁed as Stem , Goblet , and Enteroendocrine was analyzed as described ( Haber et al . , 2017 ) using publicly available R code ( https : / / portals . broadinstitute . org / single _ cell / study / small - intestinal - epithelium ) . Batch effects were analyzed with the same R code and correction was determined unnecessary . Genes with FDR q - values less than 0 . 05 were used for DAVID GO analysis . Image analysis FISH and live cell analysis was performed with custom IDL software previously described ( Coulon et al . , 2014 ) . Brieﬂy , FISH spots and live cell TSs were identiﬁed with the software localize . FISH spots were identiﬁed by using the manual bandpass threshold . Cells were segmented into nucleus and cell which includes the cell . These masks were generated using Cellproﬁler ( Carpenter et al . , 2006 ) ( Broad Institute , http : / / cellproﬁler . org / ) and used as input into a modiﬁed version of the software FISHAuxiliary for classiﬁcation of cell spots . This software also outputs the coordinates of the nuclear spots . Colocalization of TSs to determine the % of TFF1 intron spots that contained MS2 spots was performed by using these coordinates . Spots with a Euclidean distances less than or equal to 5 pixels were considered localized . All spot ﬁnding software is available at https : / / ccr . cancer . gov / Laboratory - of - Receptor - Biology - and - Gene - Expression / daniel - r - larson . Sigmoidal dose response analysis was performed with Graphpad Prism 7 . 01 using the Variable slope , four parameter logistic equation . For the 0 nM concentration , the log value was set to (cid:3) 1 . For the live cell TS tracking we also used Localize . However , since cells can move considerable during the 14 - hour period , we ﬁrst tracked cells by hand using ImageJ macros to extract mouse coordinates , and then cropped around the cell using these coordinates using custom FIJI macros . These cropped stacks were then used by Localize . Live cell TS identiﬁcation was performed using the option to have the previous frame coordinate used if no spot was found in the current frame . Live cell traces were then generated using the track function in localize . Since multiple alleles could be transcribing in the same cell at different times , traces were manually inspected . Tissue sections are hematoxylin and eosin plus protein - speciﬁc antibody immunohistochemical staining and are publicly available at http : / / www . www . proteinatlas . org . Segmentation and quantiﬁcation was accomplished through the following steps using IDL . Principal component analysis separates the color channels to enrich for a single channel containing the immunohistochemical stain . The channel containing the greatest enrichment for the antibody stain was used for subsequent analysis . Image thresholding was carried out with a maximum entropy segmentation , followed by morphological closing with a 4x4 kernel . The only user - implemented ﬁtting parameter is the minimum area required of segmented image to be considered a cell . This value varies depending on the magniﬁcation of the tissue section . Unique cells were then labeled and identiﬁed . The staining intensity of the cell was determined as the sum in the segmented region of the principal component channel . Other analysis Burst timing correlation is computed using standard cross - covariance analysis ( Coulon et al . , 2014 ; Coulon and Larson , 2016 ; Ferguson and Larson , 2013 ) . The theoretical curve for CV for single - allele traces ( Figure 5 ) is computed through Monte Carlo simulations . Each trace can be considered to have a single rate which is measured as number of bursts in 14 hr . This pool of rates can then be sampled to compute in silico trajectories . The CV is computed for each in silico trajectory and then binned into a histogram . For detailed description of analyses see below . Kolmogorov - Smirnov , correlation signiﬁcance and reduced major axis linear regression were performed using ks , cor . test , lmodel2 , R packages . Time series analysis Hidden Markov Model analysis The integrated ﬂuorescence of a diffraction - limited TS reﬂects the number of nascent RNA present at the gene . The time - dependent intensity of the spot – referred to as a ‘trajectory’ – is determined through a Gaussian Mask ﬁtting routine described in the methods and characterized previously ( Thompson et al . , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , the algorithm uses an iterative ﬁtting procedure which is based on a Gaussian distribution to approximate the point - spread function of the microscope . Local background subtraction is performed for Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 e5 each spot in each frame of the time - series , but no other manipulations are carried out to generate the raw data trace ( Figure 1G ) . For example , the trajectories are not corrected for photobleaching . These trajectories are then analyzed by a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) algorithm for ﬁnding the transcriptional bursts . First , the data are normalized to a peak height of unity . Second , the normalized data are used as input for the IDL program ‘HMM _ V5 _ 4 _ 2 _ text . sav’ described in ( Lee , 2009 ) and available at http : / / research . chem . psu . edu / txlgroup / HMM / HMM _ code . html . The output of this program is a binary trace representing the times when the gene is active and inactive . Finally , the duration of the inactive and active times are compiled from many trajectories to generate a histogram of OFF and ON times , either as a probability distribution function ( Figures 1H and 1I ) or a cumulative distribution function ( Figures 2D and 2E ) . We emphasize that the HMM ﬁtting routine is only used as an automated routine to ﬁnd bursts and therefore functions as a segmentation routine . Subsequent analyses are carried out on the empirically measured active and inactive times from the segmented trajectory , not on any rate parameters returned from the HMM algorithm directly . Master trace analysis The dynamics evident in a single - molecule ﬂuorescence trajectory are the result of processes relating to regulation ( i . e . , when a gene is active ) and also the molecular mechanisms of elongation , splicing , cleavage , and release ( Coulon et al . , 2014 ) . To isolate the latter from the former , we artiﬁcially ‘removed’ the inactive periods to generate a ﬂuorescence master trajectory which only reﬂects ﬂuo - rescence signal during active transcription ( Figures S1D – S1F ) . First , the active periods are identiﬁed through the HMM algorithm . Second , the raw trajectory data from the TS during the active periods is concatenated to generate a single ﬂuorescence trajectory ( Figures S1E and S1F ) . Although ﬂuctuations are easily visible , the mean of the trace , generated from hundreds of alleles taken from different cell passages and imaged on different days , is strikingly consistent ( Figure S1F ) . We then chose a region between frame 1200 and 4200 for autocorrelation analysis , comprising concatenated data from (cid:1) 300 bursts from (cid:1) 50 individual allele traces ( Figures S1F and S1G ) . The autocorrelation is generated using a multi - tau algorithm and ﬁt with a model for stem loops in the 3 0 UTR , as described previously in depth ( Larson et al . , 2011 ) . The equation , derived in the supplemental material of ref ( Larson et al . , 2011 ) , for a 3 0 stem loop cassette is : G ð t Þ = k c (cid:2) 2 3 (cid:3) 1 ð S ð S + 1 ÞÞ 2 e (cid:3) k t X S n = 0 ð S (cid:3) n Þð S (cid:3) n + 1 Þð 2 S + n + 1 Þð k t Þ n n ! ( Equation 2 . 1 ) where k is the rate of transition from one stem - loop to the next ; c is the initiation rate for transcription ; S is the number of stem loops ( 24 for the TFF1 - MS2 construct ) ; and t is the autocorrelation delay . From this analysis , we compute a dwell time of a TFF1 - MS2 nascent transcript of 13 . 0 ± 0 . 8 min . This dwell time includes the elongation time for the MS2 cassette ( (cid:1) 1 . 4 kb ) and any 3 0 processing steps such as cleavage and release during which the nascent transcript is still visible at the TS . In addition , the autocorrelation analysis also gives an effective initiation rate of 0 . 50 ± 0 . 02 min - 1 , the inverse of which is the time between consecutive transcripts . Bursts have an average duration of 16 min from the HMM analysis . So polymerases are capable of initiating over a 3 min window . The experimentally determined burst size is 3 min * 0 . 5 min - 1 = 1 . 5 . We note that these numbers – dwell time and effective initiation rate – are determined here through the autocorrelation analysis of the data using the 3 0 UTR stem loop calculation , which is independent from the approach described in the modeling section ( part 3 , below ) . This latter approach is based on a global analysis of ON / OFF time histograms and total mRNA at multiple doses and for a deletion mutant . The rates from the autocorrelation analysis are not used to constrain parameters in the global ﬁt . Nevertheless , there is close agreement between values returned from the global ﬁt and the autocorrelation analysis described here , supporting the independent assessments of nascent RNA dynamics independent of gene active / inactive dynamics . Allele Correlation In general , correlations between alleles can be carried out in multiple ways and over many timescales . The cell line has three alleles labeled , but all analysis is carried out as pairwise correlations , and no ternary correlations are considered . Correlations can be computed between alleles in the same nucleus or alleles from different nuclei . Correlations can be computed both from raw trajec - tories and HMM traces . Correlations can be static measurements which consider only the total output of one allele over a ﬁxed time period compared to the total output of another allele over that same time period . Conversely , correlations can be computed between bursts from different alleles using the full time - dependent trajectories . We have used multiple approaches to study inter - allele correlations , described individually in this section . Total Output Correlation Consider a cell which has multiple bursting alleles visualized over a period T . The total output of that allele is the integrated area under the ﬂuorescence trajectory after background subtraction . This quantity is computed simply by subtracting the median ﬂuorescence intensity from the trajectory ( the median is an excellent approximation of the background for sparse bursts ) and summing the result - ing trace over the observation period T . Thus , each allele is reduced to a single number , which is the integrated output . For a cell where three alleles are active , three points are generated for the scatterplot : allele 1 versus allele 2 , allele 2 versus allele 3 , and allele 1 versus allele 3 . Likewise , this operation can be carried out on the HMM trace instead of the raw trace . Instead of the integrated area under the HMM trace , we use the number of bursts ( Figure 4 ) . This simpliﬁcation is motivated by the empirical observation that burst duration is narrowly distributed for the TFF1 gene . However , it is trivial to use the area under the HMM curve as well , and the resulting e6 Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 scatterplot looks very similar ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . For each allele , one determines the number of bursts N during the observation period T , and for a three allele time series , three points are generated in the scatterplot , as described above . This correlation is the equivalent of a ‘rate correlation . ’ The rate for each allele is N / T , but since the period of observation is the same for both alleles , we simplify the analysis to the number of bursts for reasons which will become clear later . Importantly , rates of transcription can be highly correlated between alleles without any correlations between bursts . For example , if ER ( ER a ) is the rate determining factor in the nucleus , one expects that alleles might transcribe at similar rates , even though there need be no relationship between the actual times when transcription is observed at each allele , which might be largely random . Random Controls We use multiple random controls to account for possible artifacts in the measurement and cross - correlation analysis . First , we look at correlations between alleles imaged on different days . Second , we look at correlations between alleles in different ﬁelds in the same dish and imaged in the same experiment . Third , we consider correlations between alleles in cells located in the same ﬁeld . None of our analysis has revealed any statistically signiﬁcant cross - correlations for the above scenarios ( see ‘‘Experimental Cross - correla - tions’’ section below ) . Thus , the completely general random control simply consists of correlations between alleles in different cells , regardless of the ﬁeld in which the cell is located or the day on which the data were acquired . In addition , we also use simulated transcription data as a control for the time - resolved auto - and cross - correlations . This simulated transcription data consists of square pulses resembling the output of the Hidden Markov algorithm . The simulated HMM data consist of pulses or bursts which are identical in width ( 16 min , in agreement with the TFF1 - MS2 burst duration ) and height . The spacing of the bursts is determined by drawing from a uniform distribution of random numbers . Regression analysis The typical regression method , known as ordinary least - squares regression , is sufﬁcient if the x - values are user - controlled param - eters known with relatively high precision ( i . e . , dose , time , etc . ) . However , if the x - variable is also a random variable with errors which are comparable to the y - variable ( i . e . , bursts of allele one versus bursts of allele two ) , regression of one random variable on to another random variable will result in systematic deviations , a phenomenon known as ‘‘regression dilution’’ ( Sokal and Rohlf , 2012 ) . This prob - lem is well known , and a number of alternative regression approaches have been developed . Here , we use reduced major - axis regression , which is an example of Model II regression and is appropriate for data drawn from a bivariate normal distribution ( Sokal and Rohlf , 2012 ) . Cross - Correlation Analysis We emphasize that ﬂuctuation analysis occurs in two steps : 1 ) generation of the correlation function from a ﬂuorescence trajectory and 2 ) interpretation of the correlation function to infer biological parameters . The former can be carried out in a rigorous mathemat - ical way and essentially amounts to data processing without assumptions . We follow the multi - tau approach which has been devel - oped in the ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy literature over several decades ( see reference ( Wohland et al . , 2001 ) for an example ) . The latter step ( interpretation ) depends on the unique biological problem of interest . In this section , we focus largely on the information that is contained in a transcription cross - correlation . A thorough treatment of transcription correlation in general can be found in reference ( Coulon and Larson , 2016 ) . Generating the cross - correlation As with the autocorrelation , the cross - correlation is computed using a multi - tau correlation algorithm described earlier ( Coulon and Larson , 2016 ) . In these experiments , the alleles are all labeled with identical MS2 stem loops . Alleles can be distinguished within a time series , because the spatial separation and time - resolution of the imaging are sufﬁcient to uniquely identify individual TS . However , although the alleles can be distinguished , it is impossible to establish the unique allelic identity of the TS in the microscope . Thus , there is no natural ‘order’ to a cross - correlation as there would be if the alleles had different colors . Therefore , the cross - correlation is computed between two alleles in both orientations ( allele 1 / allele 2 ; allele 2 / allele 1 ) and averaged together to produce a symmetric correlation ( Figures S3C – S3G ) . In addition , the background ﬂuorescence , which essentially amounts to the cumulative time that a TS is not visible , strongly effects the interpretation of the cross - correlation , as shown below . In fact , because transcription is rare , background levels make a signif - icant contribution to the correlation . Therefore , correlations functions can be background corrected to obtain certain quantities ( such as the fraction of bursts which co - occur from two alleles ) . The ﬁnal step in generating the cross - correlation is background correction , described in detail below . If multiple correlation functions from different alleles are averaged together , which is almost always the case , there are several different methods of averaging to consider . This question is treated in detail in Coulon et al . , section 2 . 3 ( Coulon and Larson , 2016 ) . The ﬁrst , and most common , is to simply generate the arithmetic average of the individual correlations . However , this aver - aging method ignores the fact that some correlations reﬂect dozens of events , while other may only reﬂect a few events . Because the correlation function is normalized by mean ﬂuorescence , the normalization may over - or under - weight certain correlation func - tions in the arithmetic average . Thus , the underlying details of the ﬂuorescence trajectory used to generate the correlation function can introduce an implicit bias . The solution is to use a global mean of all the traces to average the correlation function . In practice , these two methods – local versus global averaging – diverge when individual trajectories are either of vastly different length or contain vastly different transcriptional activity levels . The global averaging method ( Equation 7 in reference ( Coulon and Larson , 2016 ) ) is the preferred method for transcription correlations and is used exclusively in this paper . The error bars are determined from bootstrap estimation ( Day et al . , 2015 ) . Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 e7 Interpreting the cross - correlation The auto / cross - correlation is deﬁned in the following way : G ð t Þ = h d F 1 ð t Þ d F 2 ð t + t Þi h F 1 ð t Þih F 2 ð t Þi ( Equation 2 . 2 ) where t is the autocorrelation delay ; F i ( t ) is the ﬂuorescence at time t of allele I , and angular brackets denote the average over time ; d F i ( t ) = F i ( t ) - < F i ( t ) > is the instantaneous ﬂuctuation in ﬂuorescence , deﬁned as the deviation from the average value . Taking the value at zero delay ( the y - intercept of the correlation function , also called the ‘‘amplitude’’ ) the autocorrelation for a single allele ( i = 1 ) becomes : G ð 0 Þ = s 2 F h F ð t Þi 2 ( Equation 2 . 3 ) which corresponds to the variance of the ﬂuorescence signal divided by the mean . In the examples that follow , we consider only this G ( 0 ) value for a number of different transcription scenarios . We use a geometric argument for simplicity and to convey the interpretation in terms of the raw trajectories . We assume certain deﬁned features of a transcriptional burst and show later how well these assumptions agree with the actual data . Single - allele autocorrelation Consider transcription as occurring in square pulses ( or bursts ) of equal duration ( D ) and height I over a measurement duration T ( Fig - ure S4A ) . The relevant values for G ( 0 ) can be derived by computing the variance and mean of such a signal using the deﬁnition : s 2 h D F ð t Þ 2 E (cid:3) h F ð t Þi 2 ( Equation 2 . 4 ) For square pulses , h F ð t Þi = N D c T ; D F ð t Þ 2 E = N D c 2 T ( Equation 2 . 5 ) And the variance becomes : s 2 = (cid:2) N D c T (cid:3) 2 (cid:2) T N D (cid:3) 1 (cid:3) ( Equation 2 . 6 ) Resulting in : G ð 0 Þ = s 2 h F ð t Þi 2 = T N D (cid:3) 1 ( Equation 2 . 7 ) Experimental parameters for TFF1 are T = 854 min , D = 16 min , n = 6 , resulting in a calculated G ( 0 ) of 7 . 9 . Note that this quantity does not depend on the height of the pulse c . If background is included , which amounts to a non - zero offset to the trajectory , the mean and mean squared ﬂuorescence are : h F ð t Þi = N D c T + b ; D F ð t Þ 2 E = b 2 T + N D ð c 2 + 2 bc Þ T ( Equation 2 . 8 ) but the variance is unchanged ( Equation 2 . 6 ) . Because the variance is unchanged and the mean ﬂuorescence is changed by background , the resulting G ( 0 ) , which is the ratio of the two quantities becomes : G ð 0 Þ = (cid:4) TN D (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) (cid:6) 1 + TbN D c (cid:7) 2 ( Equation 2 . 9 ) which is the actual G ( 0 ) ( Equation 2 . 7 ) reduced by a scaling factor . Thus , background always artiﬁcially lowers G ( 0 ) beneath the true value . This correction factor takes the familiar form of the well - known correction factor from FCS ( Schwille et al . , 1999 ) : G ð 0 Þ measured = G ð 0 Þ actual h h F ð t Þi h F ð t Þi(cid:3) b i 2 ( Equation 2 . 10 ) The sparse nature of transcriptional bursts can make this background correction substantial . Taking the same parameters as above but adding a constant b = 0 . 1 offset to bursts with a height of c = 1 ( i . e . , (cid:1) 10 % background ) gives a correction factor of 3 . 6 and artiﬁcially lowers the G ( 0 ) from 7 . 9 to 2 . 2 . e8 Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 Double - allele cross - correlation In cross - correlation , the variance s 2 becomes a co - variance ( s 1 , 2 ) . Consider then the static co - variance between two alleles ( 1 , 2 ) for a ﬁxed number of bursts N 1 , N 2 in time T . First , consider the case of complete overlap between the bursts of the two alleles ( Figure S4B ) . In this case , it is clear that G ( 0 ) for the cross - correlation is identical to the G ( 0 ) for the autocorrelation . This concordance is predicated on the assumption that the alleles are labeled with the same number of stem loops which bind the same number of ﬂuorophores . Second , consider the case of complete exclusion : the bursts never overlap in time ( Figure S4C ) . The co - variance can be written as : s 1 ; 2 h h F 1 ð t Þ F 2 ð t Þi (cid:3) h F 1 ð t Þih F 2 ð t Þi ( Equation 2 . 11 ) Since the ﬁrst term is 0 , the co - variance is the product of the means , and G ( 0 ) becomes : G 1 ; 2 ð 0 Þ = s 1 ; 2 h F 1 ð t Þih F 2 ð t Þi = 0 (cid:3) h F 1 ð t Þih F 2 ð t Þi h F 1 ð t Þih F 2 ð t Þi = (cid:3) 1 ( Equation 2 . 12 ) Thus , the minimum cross - correlation is (cid:3) 1 , independent of the details of the underlying dynamics . However , the peak cross - corre - lation does depend on dynamics and in the case of perfect autocorrelation where each and every pulse from one allele is accompa - nied by a pulse from the other allele , takes the value of Equation 2 . 7 . Therefore , the limits of the cross - correlation function are asymmetric : (cid:3) 1 % G 1 ; 2 ð 0 Þ % T N D (cid:3) 1 ( Equation 2 . 13 ) If we now include background in the calculation , using the same process to derive Equation 2 . 9 , the lower limit of the experimental cross - correlation becomes : G 1 ; 2 ð 0 Þ = (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) 1 + TbN D c (cid:5) 2 ( Equation 2 . 14 ) Again , a non - zero background always lowers the measured value of G ( 0 ) from the true value . Now consider the occasional overlap scenario , where some pulses from allele 1 show complete overlap with pulses from allele 2 ( Figure S4D ) : h F 1 ð t Þi = N 1 D c T h F 2 ð t Þi = N 2 D c T ( Equation 2 . 15 ) h F 1 ð t Þ F 2 ð t Þi = M D c 2 T where M is the absolute number of overlap bursts . Without loss of generality since the overlap is linear in M and D , one can also consider partial overlap in bursts ( Figure S4E ) . It is therefore straightforward to show : s 1 ; 2 = M D c 2 T (cid:3) N 1 D c T N 2 D c T ( Equation 2 . 16 ) which leads to : G 1 ; 2 ð 0 Þ = MT N 1 N 2 D (cid:3) 1 ( Equation 2 . 17 ) Note that if M = N 1 = N 2 , the results is identical to the autocorrelation amplitude deﬁned in Equation 2 . 7 . With the expressions for G ( 0 ) for both the auto - and cross - correlation in hand , one is now in the position to compute normalized quantities based on the ratio of auto - and cross - correlation : G 1 ; 2 ð 0 Þ + 1 G 1 ð 0 Þ + 1 = MTN 1 N 2 D TN 1 D = M N 2 ( Equation 2 . 18 ) This quantity ( M / N 2 ) is the fraction of bursts from allele 2 which co - occur with bursts from allele 1 . Note one particular nuance of this result : one divides by the auto - correlation from allele 1 to get the fractional co - occurring bursts of allele 2 . Moreover , it is critical to Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 e9 note that because of the constant unit - less offset in both the numerator and denominator , background effects do not normalize out in the ratio . In other words , it is imperative to do the correct background correction before computing the normalized burst fraction . The full time - dependent behavior of experimental auto - and cross - correlations is shown in Figure S4G . Equation 2 . 18 could be applied to the zero delay time point in these curves to compute the fraction of bursts which show temporal overlap . Since we have computed the limits of cross - correlation ( Equation 2 . 13 ) we now calculate random expectations of this metric for two unrelated allele signals . Consider the duty cycle of RNA signal for alleles 1 and 2 , which amounts to the probability of seeing RNA signal , P ( 1 ) , P ( 2 ) . The random expectation joint probability is the overlap of these two probabilities ( P ( 1 j 2 ) = P ( 1 ) P ( 2 ) ) : P ð 1 Þ P ð 2 Þ = (cid:2) N 1 D T (cid:3)(cid:2) N 2 D T (cid:3) ( Equation 2 . 19 ) This overlap by random chance can be discretized by D and multiplied by the observation duration T to get the absolute number of events , which we deﬁned above as M : (cid:2) T D (cid:3) P ð 1 Þ P ð 2 Þ = T D (cid:2) N 1 D T (cid:3)(cid:2) N 2 D T (cid:3) h M ( Equation 2 . 20 ) Plugging this quantity for M into the cross - correlation amplitude ( Equation 2 . 17 ) gives G 1 , 2 ( 0 ) = 0 , which is the expected result . This same value for M could also be arrived at by setting Equation 2 . 17 to zero and solving for M , yielding a random expectation : M = N 1 N 2 D T ( Equation 2 . 21 ) Using the experimental averages for TFF1 ( N 1 = N 2 = 6 , D = 16 min , T = 854 min ) gives an average number of overlap bursts of 0 . 67 , which , when normalized by the average number of bursts from each allele , gives a fractional overlap of (cid:1) 11 % . Therefore , for TFF1 the random expectation for a burst of one allele to overlap with another allele is approximately 1 in 10 . Importantly , the fractional overlap depends linearly on the number of bursts from one allele , which is why it is ultimately a ﬂawed estimator for population behavior ( Figure S4F ) . In other words , for highly active cells ( many bursts over the experimental period ) , one might expect a fraction of co - occurrence for TFF1 alleles nearing 30 % from random behavior . In the limit where one allele is always on , the fractional overlap is of course 100 % . However , for cells which are minimally active , this random fractional overlap approaches 0 % . Two conclusions can be drawn : 1 ) it is critical to measure the coupling between alleles which arises from extrinsic factors ; and 2 ) interpretation of the co - occurrence of bursts can only be done if the activity of the allele is measured over time in a live - cell assay . In summary , because the fractional overlap random expectation depends on the activity of the alleles , this number cannot be estimated by averaging cells of different activity together . However , the utility of G 1 , 2 ( t ) is that this activity dependence is removed . Essentially , the number of overlap events are effectively normalized by both N 1 and N 2 . Thus , the full cross - correlation ( and hence G 1 , 2 ( 0 ) ) can in fact be averaged between cells in a robust way , but fractional overlap can only be measured on a cell by cell basis . Thus , these measures are related but give slightly different quantities . The beneﬁt of the full cross - correlation is that different cells can be averaged together , but the drawback is that the correlation quantity G 1 , 2 ( 0 ) is asymmetric and doesn’t have an intuitive interpretation . Whereas for the fractional overlap , the interpretation is very simple but doesn’t allow for averaging across cells . Because of these advantages which are intrinsic to the full cross - correlation , we can determine a time - integrated measure of the extent to which alleles are coupled : P t ð G 1 ; 2 ð t Þ + 1 Þ P t ð G random ð t Þ + 1 Þ ( Equation 2 . 22 ) This quantity is a measure of the extent to which alleles show correlated bursts normalized to the random expecation , summed over the decay timescale of the cross correlation . Graphically , it corresponds to the area between the intra - cellular cross correlation ( i . e . , Figure 4E , blue curve ) and the random control ( Figure 4E , black curve ) . For TFF1 the quantity computed from the experimental data is 27 ± 3 % , which means that due to the coupled intrinsic noise phenomenon , one is (cid:1) 30 % more likely to see a burst from allele 2 after a burst from allele 1 within a 2 hr window than would be expected by random chance . Experimental Cross - correlations Cross - correlations were computed from a dataset consisting of 100 allele traces . Of these traces , 73 were from cells which showed transcription from more than one allele , therefore allowing cross - correlation . Cross - correlation was always carried out over the entire time trace ( T = 854 min ) . The cross - correlation amplitude ( G 1 , 2 ( 0 ) ) is shown as a function of distance between the two alleles ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . As described above , this value is asymmetric with a lower limit of (cid:3) 1 and an upper limit depending on the activity of the alleles ( Equation 13 ) . The random expectation is zero , independent of allele activity . Ordinary least square regression reveals there is a positive slope to the data ( 0 . 27 ) , and the x - intercept is 5 . 4 m m indicating that alleles which are close together show a bias toward e10 Cell 176 , 213 – 226 . e1 – e11 , January 10 , 2019 anti - correlation , whereas alleles which are far apart show a bias toward positive correlation . In contrast , the cross - correlation between random alleles shows no distance dependence and is distributed around zero ( Figure S5B ) . Note that the coordinate system is always based on position within the nucleus , so the RMS distance is arbitrary in the random case . The main point to take away is that the values are symmetrically distributed around 0 . This random control is carried out using the same number of pairs as the intra - cell correlations , and we also conﬁrmed by looking at a greater number of random pairs ( Figure S5C ) . The distance between alleles is a dynamic parameter which changes over the course of the measurement . In all of our analysis , we reduce this variable to a single number which is the root mean square separation over the entire time course : RMSdist = P T i ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ(cid:4) x 1 i (cid:3) x 2 i (cid:5) 2 + (cid:4) y 1 i (cid:3) y 2 i (cid:5) 2 q T ( Equation 2 . 23 ) here ( x ji , y ji ) is the spatial position of the j th allele in the i th frame , and here T is the absolute number of frames . An example is shown in Figure S5D . The changes in this distance over time ( Figures S5E and S5F ) result in variability in the x axis of the scatterplots ( Figure S5A ) . In addition , we computed the fractional overlap bursts ( Equation 2 . 18 ) for each cell as well ( Figures S5G and S5H ) . Note that this fractional overlap can be calculated in two ways : the fraction of bursts from allele 1 which overlap with allele 2 and the fraction of bursts from allele 2 which overlap with allele 1 , and these measures are only equivalent if the integrated activity from each allele is identical . Again , a distance dependence is observed which is not observed in the random control ( Figure S5I ) . The fractional overlap should be > 0 , so negative values arise from experimental noise . The random expectation determined across the correlations from the entire dataset ( Figure S4G ) is 9 % as computed from Equation 2 . 18 , but this random expectation can be different from cell to cell , as described above . However , the best ﬁt line shows an offset of 10 % in Figure S5I , in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction . Generalized Telegraph Model The live - cell and smFISH data were ﬁt to a fully stochastic generalized telegraph model consisting of arbitrary numbers of gene states and pre - RNA steps . Transitions between gene states were reversible . Each pre - RNA step can be occupied by zero or one molecule . One of the gene states was deemed active ; when occupied there was a probability that the ﬁrst pre - RNA step could become occu - pied if it is not already occupied . Once the ﬁrst pre - RNA step is occupied there is a probability of the molecule transitioning to the next pre - RNA step . The alleles were coupled via a mechanism in which the rate from the pre - active gene state to the active gene state for all alleles is increased by a given value if any allele is in the active gene state . The dwell time distributions ( on and off live - cell times ) and steady state mRNA distributions ( smFISH ) were computed directly using direct simulation of the model and also in closed form by solving the chemical Master equation . The free parameters ﬁt were the number of gene states and pre - RNA steps , the rates between all states and steps , and the dose effect of E2 , which was assumed to inﬂuence one of the rate parameters in the model . The best model was chosen by Bayesian model comparison ( BIC and AIC ) . In depth details of the model are available in the Methods S1 . smFISH Cell Counts Cell counts are provided in the Table S4 .
