Abstract Members of the WASP protein family are direct activators of the arp2 / 3 complex , thereby regulating the nucleation of branched actin assemblies within the cell . Each sub - class possesses a unique N - terminal domain architecture allowing a division of labour between its members , each coupling different signal transduction pathways to the nucleation of specific actin structures WASH ( WASP and SCAR homologue ) is a newly identified member of the WASP protein family . Due to its disruption in Drosophila proving lethal ( Linardopopoulou et al . , 2007 ) little is know as to the functional role of WASH at the cellular level . Other than it is important in the development of multicellular organisms . Here we successfully disrupt WASH in the single celled amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum and discover a role for WASH in the endocytic pathway . WASH was shown to be essential for the trafficking of indigestible material through the endocytic pathway , with its disruption causing a complete bock in cellular defecation . This was shown to be due to a defect in lysosomal maturation into neutral post - lysosomes . Using fluorescently tagged fusion proteins we show that WASH recruitment coincides with removal of the Vacuolar H + ATPase from lysosomal membranes , and suggests a possible role for WASH and actin in regulating the luminal pH of intracellular compartments . i Table of Contents List of figures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi Supplementary movies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . viii Abbreviations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . x Chapter 1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 1 . 1 The Actin Cytoskeleton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 1 . 2 Actin polymerisation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 1 . 3 Arp2 / 3 complex . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1 . 4 WASP family proteins . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 1 . 4 . 1 WASP . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 1 . 4 . 2 SCAR / WAVE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 1 . 4 . 3 WASH . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 1 . 4 . 4 WHAMM and JMY . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 1 . 5 Vesicular compartmentalisation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 1 . 5 . 1 pH and function . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21 1 . 5 . 2 pH regulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 1 . 6 V -

This filamentous network is an essential component of almost all eukaryotes , and recently an analogous structure has been discovered in prokaryotes ( van den Ent et al . , 2001 ) further emphasising the importance of these structures . In combination with accessory proteins actin filaments can form either branched arrays or parallel bundles . These structures can also be dynamic or transient with some structures disassembling moments after their formation , or some persisting for the lifetime of the cell . Cells utilise the actin cytoskeleton in a range of cellular processes as a means of providing structural rigidity , protrusive , or contractive forces . A traditional example is that of cellular motility , an event critical during development , immune response and wound healing . Filament elongation provides force for cellular protrusions ( Miyata et al . , 1999 ) , whilst a branched cortical actin scaffold supplies rigidity to maintain cell shape . Along with myosin , actin filaments also create contractile forces for the retraction of the rear ( Iwadate & Yumura , 2008 ) . Other biological processes documented to utilise the actin cytoskeleton include endocytosis ( Kaplan , 1977 ) , exocytosis ( Muallem et al . , 1995 ) , cytoplasmic streaming ( Wehland et al . , 1978 ) , vesicle propulsion ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ) , cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesions ( Vasioukhin et al . , 2000 ) , and cytokinesis ( Carter , 1967 ) ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . 2 Str es Nucleus Filopodia and cell spikes Membr les and lamellipodia Phagocytic structures Cell junctions Endocytic structures F - actin Golgi actin and / or membrane tubules Figure 1 . 1 : The actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells Depiction of filamentous actin structures within eukaryotic cells . Branched actin structures are involved in phagocytosis , pinocytosis , membrane ruffles , lamellipodia and serves unknown roles on golgi and membrane tubules . Bundled actin structures are involved in forming stress fibres , spiky filopodia protrusions , and unknown roles in the nucleus . Image adapted from Campellone & Welch ( 2010 ) 3 1 . 2 Actin polymerisation Actin is a highly conserved 42KDa protein that is typically the most abundantly expressed protein within eukaryotic cells . In a concentration dependent manner , monomeric actin ( G - actin ) can spontaneously self - assemble into helical filaments ( F - actin ) . G - actin also contains an ATP binding cleft , and ATPase activity once incorporated into a filament . This supplies filaments with two forms of polarity , 1 ) structurally due to the head - to - tail orientation of monomers with the cleft exposed at one end but not the other , and 2 ) ATP - bound actin at newly formed polymerising tips ( for a detailed review of filament formation see Pollard & Borisy , 2003 ) . The polarity of the filament results in each end having varying kinetics , a fast and a slow growing end . The fast growing end , and the site of filament elongation in vivo , is known as the ‘barbed’ end . The slow growing end , and typically the site of filament depolymerisation in vivo is termed the ‘pointed’ end . In vitro experiments with purified actin have revealed that the rate limiting step in polymerisation is the initial formation of a stable actin trimer ( nucleation ) . This is thermodynamically unfavourable because actin dimers are unstable and rapidly dissociate before the addition of the next monomer . However , once formed trimers are more stable allowing G - actin to be incorporated to elongate the filament ( Pollard & Mooseker , 1981 ) . In vivo spontaneous de novo formation of actin filaments is thought not to occur . Cells have evolved several mechanisms for overcoming the thermodynamically unfavourable step of actin nucleation in a regulated manner . 4 Recently a new group of actin nucleators have been identified . Spire was discovered in Drosophila and shown to be required for axis specification in oocytes and embryos during development ( Quinlan et al . , 2005 ) . Cordon - Bleu was discovered as a brain enriched protein controlling neuronal morphology where its depletion by RNAi decreased neurite branch points ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . Finally , Leiomodin is a protein specific to skeletal and cardiac muscle and is thought to nucleate tropomyosin - decorated filaments in muscles ( Chereau et al . , 2008 ) . These proteins have all been shown to nucleate unbranched actin filaments in in vitro actin polymerisation assays ( Quinlan et al . , 2005 ; Ahuja et al . , 2007 ; Chereau et al . , 2008 ) . They all contain three or more actin binding domains in tandem that may either form a long pitch polymer stabilising monomers in a head to tail arrangement ( Quinlan et al . , 2005 ) , or arrange actin monomers in a short pitch trimer configuration forming a stable barbed end ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . Formins are a second class of actin nucleators that generate unbranched actin filaments . Although formins have attracted a great deal of research the mechanism by which they nucleate actin filaments is still not clear . All formins contain conserved formin homology domains , FH1 and FH2 . These alone are sufficient for actin nucleation ( Sagot et al . , 2002 ) , and this is dependent upon their ability to dimerise ( Moseley et al . , 2004 ) . These structures however have no affinity for monomeric actin , but have high affinity for the barbed ends of filaments ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . Formins are unique amongst actin nucleators in that they remain bound to the barbed end of the filament they nucleate and enhance the polymerisation rate whilst protecting the end from capping proteins ( Zigmond et al . , 2003 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . It has been proposed that formins nucleate actin by binding to transiently formed actin dimers and stabilising these making trimers more thermodynamically favourable ( Pring et al . , 5 2003 ) . Formins have been reported to have roles at adhesion junctions ( Kobielak et al . , 2004 ) , filopodia ( Peng et al . , 2003 ) and formation of the contractile ring ( Chang et al . , 1997 ) . Finally , the first identified and best characterised of the actin nucleators is the Arp2 / 3 complex . It is unique in its ability to generate branched actin structures and nucleates actin through structural mimicry of the barbed end of a filament . 1 . 3 Arp2 / 3 complex The Arp2 / 3 complex was first discovered in Acanthamoeba by affinity chromatography with the actin binding protein profilin ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . It consists of 7 subunits ; ARPC1 - ARPC5 , Arp2 and Arp3 , each present in a single copy ( Mullins et al , 1997 ) . Arp2 and Arp3 subunits are structurally similar to actin and are thought to simulate a stable actin dimer , requiring the addition of only a single monomer to mimic the ‘barbed’ end of a filament ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . In vitro the addition of the Arp2 / 3 complex with purified actin shows a minor increase in the rate of nucleation , however in the presence of a suitable activator it drastically increases the rate of actin nuclei formation ( Higgs & Pollard , 1999 ) . Like actin , arp2 and arp3 possess ATP binding clefts ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) and ATPase activity ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ) . The crystal structure of the arp2 / 3 complex has been solved both with and without bound nucleotides , and in both cases the spatial separation of the arp2 and arp3 subunits suggested that by the current model this was an inactive complex ( Robinson et al . , 2001 ; Nolen & Pollard , 2007 ) . The binding of WASP , an Arp2 / 3 activator 6 ( discussed in section 1 . 4 . 1 ) , was shown to induce a conformational shift in the complex ( Rodal et al . , 2005 ) and this is thought to reposition the arp2 subunit into close proximity to arp3 stimulating its nucleation efficiency ( Egile et al . , 2005 ) . To date a crystal structure of the active complex has not been solved . However , X - ray scattering experiments on purified arp2 / 3 complex bound with the activating domain from a WASP family protein supports this widely accepted model ( Boczkowska et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . The arp2 / 3 complex is unique amongst other known actin nucleators in its innate ability to generate branched actin structures . These are thought to be necessary to provide rigidity for further polymerisation and generation of protrusive force that could not be achieved by parallel arrangements ( Mogilner & Oster . , 1996 ) . It has been localised to sites of phagocytosis , macropinocytosis , membrane protrusions and ruffles , intracellular vesicles , dynamic puncta in filopodia , invadopodia and adhesion junctions ( Insall et al . , 2001 ; Johnston et al . , 2008 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ; Kovacs et al . , 2002 ) , showing that it is a common component of the cells force generating machinery . In electron micrographs the arp2 / 3 complex could be seen at branch - points binding simultaneously to two filaments , one at its side and the other capping its ‘pointed’ end ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . This was later confirmed by immunogold labelling with antibodies towards the complex ( Svitkina & Borisy , 1999 ) . This led Mullins et al . , ( 1998 ) to propose the now widely accepted dendritic model of actin polymerisation . In this model the arp2 / 3 complex binds to the side of an existing filament ( ‘mother’ filament ) and nucleates a new ‘daughter’ filament at a 70 ° angle . Figure 1 . 3 shows the dendritic nucleation model together with other components of the actin remodelling machinery ( see Figure legend for description ) . 7 Figure 1 . 2 : Structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Proposed model of activated Arp2 / 3 complex with bound actin at the barbed end of arp2 . Mother and daughter filaments are greyed out , and the position of the VCA domain peptide is shown in its most likely position . Image taken from Boczkowska et al . , ( 2008 ) . 8 Figure 1 . 3 : Arp2 / 3 mediated dendritic nucleation model . Illustration of the dendritic nucleation model proposed by Mullins et al . , ( 1998 ) and the interaction of key components of the actin regulatory machinery . WASP family members are activated by GTPases in response to stimuli and localised to the cytosolic surface of membranes . Here they activate the Arp2 / 3 complex on the side of filaments . Profilin bound ATP is then incorporated at the barbed ends of uncapped filaments activating actins’ ATPase activity . Cofilin binds and severs old ADP - bound actin filaments adding to the pool of G - actin . Profilin binds to ADP - actin catalysing the exchange with ATP creating monomers for reinsertion into the barbed end of actin filaments . Image taken from Pollard ( 2003 ) . 9 Observations that the rate of arp2 / 3 nucleation was dependent on the number of free barbed ends , and not on the length of actin filaments has also led to the less popular barbed end branching model ( Pantaloni et al . , 2000 ) . In this model the arp2 / 3 complex binds to the barbed end of filaments nucleating two new filaments creating a Y branch . The dendritic model is much better supported by structural data . There are a number of factors that are thought to contribute towards the activity of the arp2 / 3 complex . Binding of ATP in the nucleotide binding clefts of arp2 and arp3 are essential for nucleation ( Goley et al . , 2004 ) . Although ATP hydrolysis is not required for nucleation it has been shown to be required for debranching , a process important for endocytosis in budding yeast ( Clainche et al . , 2003 ; Martin et al . , 2006 ) . Additionally , the binding to the side of filaments is also thought to induce conformational changes that stabilises the branch point and increases its nucleation activity ( Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . The first activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex to be identified was ActA from the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes ( Kocks et al . , 1992 ) . Although this organism does not possess actin or the arp2 / 3 complex , it is an intracellular pathogen that utilises the hosts own actin machinery to drive internalisation and propulsion . ActA is tethered to the surface of the bacterium with a polarised distribution ( Kocks et al . , 1993 ) . This protein then binds to the arp2 / 3 complex enhancing its nucleation ability 50 fold ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) , and is therefore commonly referred to as a nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) This generates a branched actin network on one side of the bacterium creating a comet tail of polymerising actin propelling the bacterium through the cytoplasm ( Welch et al . , 1998 ; Cameron et al . , 2001 ) . ActA is 10 thought to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex by mimicking a group of proteins present within the host cell belonging to the WASP family . These proteins are currently the best characterised activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex . 1 . 4 WASP family proteins The WASP family are a group of proteins responsible for coupling signalling pathways to the activation of the arp2 / 3 complex . They all share a conserved C - terminal domain architecture , containing a polyproline rich region , one or more actin binding WH2 ( V ) domains , a connector ( C ) motif and terminate in a region rich in acidic residues ( A ) . In vitro experiments have shown that this VCA domain alone is necessary and sufficient to activate the arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) . The C and A regions contribute to binding of the arp2 / 3 complex ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . This interaction is mediated by a conserved tryptophan residue within the acidic region that interacts with ARPC1 ( Pan et al . , 2004 ) , and its mutation was shown in vitro to reduce the efficiency of Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . The WH2 domain is a generic G - actin binding structure found in many actin regulating proteins ( Paunola et al . , 2002 ) , and its location near the arp2 / 3 binding region is thought to guide the first actin monomer into position upon arp2 / 3 activation ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . The domain architecture is more divergent amongst the N terminal region of WASP family proteins , causing them to be sub - grouped . For more than a decade it was thought that there were only two subgroups of the WASP - family , WASP and SCAR / WAVE proteins . Recently three new subgroups have been identified , WASH ( Linardopoulou et al . , 2007 ) , WHAMM 11 ( Campellone et al . , 2008 ) , and JMY ( Zuchero et al . , 2009 ) . WHAMM and JMY however are only present in vertebrates , whereas WASH has been identified in organisms in every branch of the eukaryotic tree , and found to be even more ubiquitous than WASP or SCAR ( Veltman & Insall . 2010 ) . Figure 1 . 4 shows the domain architecture of the 5 known sub - classes of WASP family proteins . It is the domains within N - terminal region of WASP family proteins that are thought to couple signalling and localisation signals to Arp2 / 3 activation . Therefore the different subgroups allow multiple Arp2 / 3 dependent actin structures to be regulated independently of each other , in response to different signalling cascades . 1 . 4 . 1 WASP WASP was the first identified member of the WASP - family proteins . It was discovered in search of the causative mutation responsible for the X - linked hereditary disease Wiskott - Aldrich Sydrome ( WAS ) ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) , a disease characterised by thrombocytopenia , defects in T and B cell function and eczema ( Ammann & Hong , 1989 ) . In mammalian cells WASP was found to be expressed only in haematopoietic cell lines ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) . It was later discovered that mammals possess another WASP protein that is more ubiquitously expressed and termed N - WASP ( neuronal WASP ) due to its enrichment within the brain ( Mike et al . , 1996 ) . 12 Figure 1 . 4 : Domain architecture of WASP family proteins . WASP : WH1 ( WASP homology 1 ) , CRIB ( Cdc42 and Rac interactive domain ) , WH2 ( WASP homology domain 2 ) . SCAR : SHD ( SCAR homology domain ) . WASH : WHD1 ( WASH homology domain 1 ) , WHD2 ( WASP homology domain 2 ) . WHAMM : WMD ( WHAMM membrane interaction domain ) . JMY : L ( actin monomer binding Linker ) WASP SCAR WASH WHAMM JMY 13 WASP proteins contain a WH1 ( WASP Homology 1 ) domain followed by a basic region , CRIB ( Cdc42 and Rac interactin domain ) domain , polyproline rich region and terminate in an Arp2 / 3 activating VCA domain . Purified WASP proteins , with the exception of the Drosophila and yeast homologuoes , are inactive in vitro due to an auto - inhibitory interaction between the VCA domain and the N - terminus of the protein ( Kim et al . , 2000 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ; Rodal et al . , 3003 ) . Binding of signalling molecules to regions within the N - terminus is thought to disrupt this inhibitory conformation freeing the VCA domain to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ) . N - WASP was first discovered in a screen for proteins that interacts with the small GTPase , cdc42 ( cell division cycle 42 ) . When active cdc42 was microinjected into Swiss 3T3 cells it was found to induce the formation of filopodia ( Nobes et al . , 1995 ) . N - WASP was thus suggested to mediate filopodia formation by activating the arp2 / 3 complex in response to binding with active cdc42 ( Symons et al . , 1996 , Miki et al . , 1998 ) . Its role in filopodia formation remains unclear due to conflicting studies showing that disruption of N - WASP can reduce the number of filopodia ( Martinez - quiles et al . , 2001 ) , whilst others report no defect ( Lommel et al . , 2001 ; Benesch et al . , 2005 ) . In knockout studies disruption of WASP in mice was shown to produce similar defects to human WAS patients , with defective chemotaxis of B - cells toward chemokines ( Snapper et al . , 1998 ; Westerberg et al . , 2005 ) . Disruption of N - WASP in mice and the single WASP homologue in Dictyostelium proved lethal ( Snapper et al . , 2001 ; Myers et al . , 2005 ) . 14 However , a conditional N - WASP mouse has been made and it was shown that cells with disrupted N - WASP have defects in EGF - receptor internalisation and actin assembly at sites of clathrin - coated pits ( Benesch et al . , 2005 ) . This role is consistent with roles of the yeast WASP homologue ( Las17 / Bee1 ) that is essential for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Naqvi et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast knockout studies of the single WASP homologue in Drosophila were viable , with only mild developmental abnormalities due to defects in cell - fate decisions . ( Ben - Yaacov et al . , 2001 ) . These defects could be recovered by expression of full length WASH but not a C terminally truncated form missing its VCA domain implying that it is the actin organising function of WASP that is important in controlling cell - fate ( Tal et al . , 2002 ) . N - WASP has been found to localise to the leading edge of a variety of cell types ( Bensenor et al . , 2007 ; Kawamura et al . , 2004 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ; Lorenz et al . , 2004 ) , and depletion of N - WASP in MDBK cells by siRNA was shown to disrupt cell migration ( Bensenor et al . , 2007 ) . However , this effect has not been seen with disruption of N - WASP in other cell types ( Snapper et al . , 2001 . , Innocenti et al . , 2005 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . N - WASP has also been shown to be essential for the formation of invadopodia ( Mizutani et al . , 2002 ) . These are projections from metastatic cancer cells that are involved in matrix degredation and believed to be a contributing factor to the invasiveness of cells ( Chen , 1989 ) . Propulsion of internal structures within cells has also been attributed to WASP - dependent actin structures . Similar to Listeria , the intracellular pathogen Shigella utilises the hosts actin 15 polymerisation machinery to generate an asymmetric actin comet tail for cytoplasmic propulsion , however this pathogen requires the host’s N - WASP to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . A similar mechanism has been observed for vesicle propulsion in Xenopous extracts where WASP dependent polymerisation results in rocketing of endosomes and lysosomes ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . 1 . 4 . 2 SCAR / WAVE SCAR ( suppressor of cAR ) was first discovered in Dictyostelium in a screen for mutants that supressed the developmental defects caused by deletion of the cAMP receptor ( Bear et al . , 1998 ) . Homologues in mammalian cells were then simultaneously identified by two labs , one lab retaining the name from Dictyostelium ( Machesky & Insall et al . , 1998 ) and the other proposing the new name WAVE ( WASP - family verprolin homology protein ) ( Miki et al . , 1998 ) . Two further isoforms were later discovered revealing a total of 3 isoforms in mammalian cells ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ) . Unlike WASPs , SCARs when purified were found to be active and also do not contain any known GTPase binding domains ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) , showing a different regulatory mechanism . It was shown that in vivo SCAR exists in a 350kDa complex with 4 other proteins ; Nap125 ( Nck - associate protein ) , PIR121 ( p53 - inducible mRNA ) , Abi2 ( Abl interactor 2 ) and HSPC300 ) ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) , and the disruption of any of these members 16 results is SCAR degradation ( Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Ibara et al . , 2006 ) . This suggested that these proteins may hold SCAR inactive and that the regulatory input for SCAR activation may reside on one of these proteins ( Eden et la . , 2002 ) . Previous data showing that PIR121 and Rac interact ( Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ) , and that activated Rac induces lamellipodia formation ( Nobes et al . , 1995 ) generated a model whereby SCAR orchestrates Arp2 / 3 dependent actin formation in lamellipodia in response to Rac activation ( Miki et al . , 1998 ; Eden et al . , 2002 ) . Genetic disruption of the single gene encoding SCAR in Dictyostelium generated small cells with defects in movement . Although this showed a role for SCAR in generating cellular protrusions , the presence of small protrusions demonstrated that it was not the only mechanism ( Bear et al . , 1998 ; Blagg et al . , 2003 ) . Deletion of SCAR in Drosophila however was lethal with development arresting during oogenesis . Mutations in alleles of SCAR also revealed a reduction in the quantity of cortical actin in these cells ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ) . Of the three SCAR isoforms in mammalian cells SCAR1 and SCAR2 have been disrupted in mice . SCAR1 null mice have sensorimotor defects , reduced learning and memory and reduced viability ( Dahl et al . , 3003 ; Soderling et al . , 2003 ) . Removal of SCAR2 is lethal with embryos showing defects in angiogenesis , heart and brain development ( Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ) 1 . 4 . 3 WASH WASH is the most widely distributed member of the WASP family among eukaryotes ( Veltman & Insall , 2010 ) . It was identified as a new sub - class of the WASP protein family 17 whilst investigating duplicated genes in the sub - telomeric regions of primate chromosomes ( Linardopolou et al . , 2007 ) . The N terminal region of WASH members is conserved across all eukaryotes and contains two domains of unknown function , WHD1 ( WASH homology domain 1 ) and WHD2 ( WASH homology domain 2 ) ( Linardopolou et al . , 2007 ) , although recently the WHD2 domain was shown to interact with tubulin ( Gomez & Billadeau . , 2009 ) . In vivo WASH exists in a large multi - protein complex containing Strumpellin , VPEF , SWIP , CCDC53 and capZ ( Jia et al . , 2010 ; Derivery & Gautreau , 2010 ; Veltman et al . , 2010 ) . Little is known about these complex members other than VPEF has previously been described as a protein required for entry of the vaccinia virus in to HeLa cells ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) , and Strumpellin when mutated was found to be the cause of a hereditary form of spastic paraplegia ( Valdmanis et al . , 2007 ) . How this data fits in with current literature on WASH is unclear . Although little is known as to the regulation of WASH , due to its presence in a large complex parallels have been drawn between WASH and regulation of SCAR ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , work in Drosophila suggests WASH may be activated downstream of Rho ( Liu et al . , 2007 ) . Genetic disruption of WASH in Drosophila was lethal , with pupae failing to progress to adulthood ( Linardopolou et al . , 2007 ) . A further study in which WASH expression levels were only reduced rather than completely disrupted discovered a role for WASH in ooplasmic streaming during Drosophila development , although the function of WASH in this role is unclear ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Recently numerous reports have been published identifying roles 18 for WASH in the endocytic pathway of mammalian cells . WASH disruption by RNAi revealed defects in transferrin receptor recycling ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) , retromer - mediated CI - MPR trafficking back to the golgi ( Gomez & Billadeau 2009 ) and altered endosome morphology with increased tubulation ( Duleh et al 2010 ) . WASH has also been documented to be involved in the invasive entry of Salmonella , with WASH localising to sites of internalisation , while RNAi depletion reduces uptake ( Hanisch et al . , 2010 ) . In mammalian cells WASH was shown to localise predominantly to sorting and recycling endosomes and to a lesser extent with late endosomes and lysosomes . On these compartments It was seen to reside in spatially restricted puncta rather than being uniformly dispersed ( Gomez & Billadeau et al . , 2009 ; Derivery et al . , 2009 ) . Taken together these observations were suggested to show a role for WASH in vesicle scission ( Gomez & Billadeau , 2009 ; Derivery et al . , 2009 ) . Authors argued that in cells where WASH had been depleted by RNAi , the increased tubulation observed suggested a role for WASH in resolving elongating tubules into carrier vesicles . 1 . 4 . 4 WHAMM and JMY WHAMM and JMY are two of the newest identified members of the WASP - protein family , however they are restricted to vertebrates ( Campellone et al . , 2008 ; Zuchero et al . , 2009 ) . Both WHAMM and JMY have distinct N - terminal domains followed by a region predicted to form a coiled coil domain . In addition WHAMM contains an addition WH2 domain upstream of its VCA domain , whereas JMY contains 3 WH2 domains in total as well as an actin 19 binding linker . Interestingly this allows JMY to nucleate unbranched actin structures in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Zuchero et al . , 2009 ) . Campellone et al , ( 2008 ) showed WHAMM localisation to the cis - golgi and to tubulovesicular structures . Altering expression levels of WHAMM was found to disrupt the morphology of the golgi and disrupt traffic from the ER to the golgi . Zuchero et al . , ( 2009 ) showed that JMY has a nuclear localisation in non - motile cells , but during motility its localisation shifts to the plasma membrane . Increasing and decreasing expression levels of JMY enhanced and decreased migration respectively . 1 . 5 Vesicular compartmentalisation The cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is densely packed with a diverse array of internal organelles . These are analogous to organs in higher multicellular organisms , acting as distinct subunits performing specialised functions . These membrane bound compartments allow cellular processes to be physically separated , for example restricting degradative proteases required for catabolism within lysosomes where they cannot degrade cytoplasmic enzymes that are essential for metabolism . 20 The endocytic and biosynthetic - secretory pathways are involved in trafficking of membrane and material throughout the cell . The endocytic pathway is involved in the internalisation of plasma - membrane and extracellular material . Membrane and receptors destined for return to the plasma membrane are sorted and trafficked separately from material destined for degradation in lysosomes . The biosynthetic pathway is responsible for the trafficking and post - translation modifications of newly synthesised transmembrane proteins or proteins destined for lysosomes , secretion or involved in post - translation modification within these compartments . Both pathways require transport of material between compartments whilst maintaining the unique identity and assortment of luminal enzymes of the compartments . Vesicle identity is maintained by an assortment of small GTPases ( Arfs and Rabs ) , SNAREs and lipid modifications . These ensure specificity between vesicle - vesicle fusion events . Although it is the cytosolic surface of vesicles that contains the markers that allow the cell to distinguish vesicle identity , each compartment is also characterised by a distinct combination of luminal proteins and pH . 1 . 5 . 1 pH and function The luminal pH of intracellular vesicles has been shown to be important for a range of cellular processes . Acidification of early endosomes causes release of ligands from internalised receptors , such as low density lipoprotein , insulin , and iron allowing the unoccupied receptors to be trafficked back to the plasma membrane ( Dunn et al . , 1989 , Marshall et al . , 1983 ; ) . By 21 the same mechanism the low pH in lysosomes causes hydrolytic enzymes to dissociate from the mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor allowing its return to the golgi , where it can again bind proteins destined for lysosomal compartments ( Westcott et al . , 1986 ) . As material progresses through the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways each compartment is accompanied by a change in pH , typically a pH drop ( Mellman et al . , 1986 , Yamashiro et al . , 1984 , Paroutis et al . , 2004 ) ( Figure 1 . 5 ) . This is presumably to allow retrograde recycling of unoccupied receptors at each stage . Luminal pH has also been reported to play a role in budding . The formation of beta - COP coated carrier vesicles that transport material from early to late endosomes has been shown to be dependent on luminal pH ( Gu & Gruenberg , 2000 ) . These processes are fundamental for maintaining distinct vesicular compartments and controlled targeting of luminal contents . In addition to its importance in receptor trafficking and budding , regulation of pH is critical for biochemical activity within the lumen . The catalytic activity of enzymes is highly dependent upon pH . Therefore the activity of enzymes as they pass through the endocytic or secretory pathways will change , allowing two organelles with different luminal pH to undergo different biochemical reactions even when they contain the same complement of luminal proteins . 22 Figure 1 . 5 : Luminal pH of intracellular vesicles . Illustration of luminal pH of vesicular compartments of both the endocytic and biosynthetic secretory pathways . Image adapted from Demaurex ( 2002 ) 6 6 . 4 23 1 . 5 . 2 pH regulation The luminal pH of each compartment is maintained within in a narrow range . Due to a neutral cytoplasm , producing acidic vesicles requires active transport of protons into the lumen . This is done by the evolutionary conserved V - ATPase ( Vacuolar H + ATPase ) which is found on all compartments of the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways , except the ER and recycling endosome ( Kim et al . , 1998 , Gagescu et al . , 2000 ) . Experiments with specific inhibitors towards the V - ATPase revealed that without continual proton pumping the acidic compartments neutralise therefore inferring that the membranes are proton ‘leaky’ ( Demaurex et al . , 1998 ) . This has resulted in the ‘pump and leak’ model ( reviewed in Demaurex , 2002 ) whereby vesicles reach a steady state pH when the rate of protons pumped into the lumen matches that of protons leaked . Although the V - ATPase is the primary mechanism for acidification it is not well understood what regulates the luminal pH with in a specific range . Mathematical models predict that endosomes containing only V - ATPase would have luminal pH values of 3 – 4 for endosomes of radius 0 . 1 - 1 µ m respectively ( Rybak et al . , 1997 ) . As this is lower than the range observed in endocytic compartments it is largely thought that endosomal pH is adjusted by other mechanisms other than V - ATPase localisation . V - ATPase is electrogenic creating a high concentration of positively charged H + ions inside the lumen . This creates an electrical potential across the membrane that limits V - ATPase activity and acidification . The presence of Na + , K + ATPase is suggested to limit acidification of endosomes by increasing the concentration of positive ions in the lumen increasing the membrane potential ( Fuchs et al . , 1989 ) . By the same reasoning it is also thought that the 24 ability of a vesicle to acidify is limited by the flow of counter - ions such as Cl - . An influx of Cl - through chloride channels would dissipate the membrane potential allowing a lower pH to be reached ( van Dyke , 1983 ) . This is a widely accepted model for regulation of luminal pH , however studies have also shown that membrane potential is not a factor in the acidification of the Golgi , casting doubt on the significance of these factors ( Demaurex et al . , 1998 ; Schapiro & Grinstein , 2000 ) . Another mechanism that could regulate luminal pH is by regulating the rate of leaking protons . It was shown that the rate of proton leaking was highest in the ER and this rate decreased along the secretory pathway . This suggested that the rate of leaking can be and is modulated ( Wu et al . , 2000 ) , possibly through voltage - gated proton channels or H + antiporters ( reviewed in Decoursey . , 2003 ) There is however growing evidence that pH may be regulated by directly effecting V - ATPase localisation or activity . It was observed that recycling endosomes containing transferrin receptor were less acidic than early endosomes and this correlated with lack of V - ATPase on that compartment . The receptor was observed to have initially gone through an acidic compartment and thus the neutralisation of the recycling endosome may be due to changing the density of the V - ATPase within the membrane ( Gagescu et al . , 2002 ) . Additionally , the V - ATPase is also suggested to dissociate into two components to disrupt activity ( discussed in section 1 . 6 . 1 ) . It has recently been reported that the ratio of these two components on membranes differs along the endocytic pathway , with a higher abundance of intact V - ATPase on later compartments ( Lafourcade et al . , 2008 ) 25 1 . 6 V - ATPase V - ATPase ( Vacuolar H + ATPase ) is a highly conserved proton pump that is structurally and functionally similar to F - type ATPase ( ATPsynthase ) . It is responsible for coupling ATP hydrolysis with the transport of protons across membranes . In addition to driving the acidification of intracellular vesicles , the proton gradient is used to drive transport of molecules across membranes such as K + , Na + , Ca + and neurotransmitters by H + anti - porters ( Wieczorek et al . , 1991 ; Onken & Putzenlechner , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1992 ) . Although it is primarily associated with internal vesicles it has also been observed in some cases within the plasma membrane . In osteoclasts it is targeted to the membrane at sites of bone reabsorption , acidifying the extracellular space required for reabsorbtion ( Blair et al . , 1989 ) . The intercalated cells of the distal tubule maintain the blood at a constant pH by either excreting acid into the urine when blood pH is too low ( Karet et al . , 1999 ) , or reabsorbing acid from the urine when the blood pH is too high ( Wagner et al . , 2004 ) . The clear cells in the vas deferens use membrane bound V - ATPase to acidify the extracellular space maintaining an acidic environment suitable for sperm maturation and storage , and cell types such as macrophages and neutrophils which occasionally encounter acidic environments may utilise plasma membrane V - ATPase to maintain a neutral cytosol ( Brisseau et al . , 1996 ) . The localization of V - ATPase on the plasma membrane has also been seen on human breast cancer cell line MB - 231 cells and thought to account for its invasiveness . The structure of the V - ATPase is closely related to that of both A and F type ATPases ( Cross & Muller et al . , 2004 ) . It is composed of two complexes ( Figure 1 . 6 ) . The peripheral complex ( V 1 ) consists of 8 different proteins , A - H , many of which are present in multiple copies . The 26 Figure 1 . 6 . Structure of the Vacuolar H + ATPase Image shows the intact structure of the V ATPase . Yellow and orange subunits A - H make up the cytosolic V1 domain . Gray and purple subunits a - e belong to the transmembrane domain . Upon ATP hydrolysis the V1 domain drives rotation of the central rotor ( orange and purple . Protons enter the channel at the cytosolic face of the a subunit gaining acess to the glutamic acid residues upon rotation these transport protons the luminal channel in subunit a , completing the transport process . Image taken from Toei et al . , ( 2010 ) 27 transmembrane complex ( V 0 ) is a pore forming channel dependent upon the rotatory action of the V 1 complex to drive the rotation of a proteolipid ring for proton translocation . It is composed of 6 different proteins ( a , c , c’ , c’’ , d , and e ) with the c subunit present in multiple copies . The V - ATPase is a rotatory pump coupling ATP hydrolysis dependent rotation to transport of protons across membranes ( Imamura et al . , 2003 ) . A nucleotide binding site on the interface between Subunits A and B is the site of ATP hydrolysis . As this occurs it causes a conformational shift that drives the rotation of the stalks and the proteolipid ring ( for a detailed review of V - ATPase mechanics see Nakanishi - Matsui et al . , 2010 ) . Within the a subunit of V 0 there is believed to possess a pore that gives access to the concealed glutamic acid residues of the proteolipid ring . These residues can undergo reversible protonation during rotation facilitating the transport of the protons to the luminal space ( Hirata et al . , 1997 ) 1 . 6 . 1 V - ATPase regulation Much of what is known about cellular regulation of the V - ATPase has come about from studies in yeast . Yeast have a unique trait in that unlike other organisms disrupting the V - ATPase is not lethal providing they are grown in acidic conditions , making then an ideal system for disruptional based studies ( Nelson & Nelson , 1990 ) . There appears to be two mechanisms by which V ATPase can be directly regulated and these are 1 ) adjusting coupling efficiency of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation , and 2 ) reversible dissociation of V 1 and V 0 complexes . 28 In yeast it was noticed that the V - ATPase of the vacuole contained a much higher coupling efficiency than that of V - ATPase molecules within the Golgi ( Kawasaki - Nishi et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly mutations introduced into subunit d of V 0 and subunit A of V 1 have both been shown to increase the coupling efficiency of V - ATPase molecules ( Owegi et al . , 2006 ; Shao et al . , 2003 ) Reversible dissociation is to date the best characterised mechanism for V - ATPase regulation . This process was first discovered in yeast upon glucose starvation ( Kane , 1995 ) and also in the gut of insect larvae ( Sumner et al . , 1995 ) . Upon dissociation the V 1 complex becomes incapable of hydrolysing ATP , and V 0 is impermeable to protons ( Parra et al . , 2000 ) . Several studies have also shown that similar mechanisms may be taking place in mammalian cells , with glucose stimulating V - ATPase assembly in kidney cells ( Sautin et al . , 2005 ) , and differences in the ratio of V 1 / V 0 on compartments of the endocytic pathway suggests dissociation ( Lafourcade et al . , 2008 ) . In yeast this process is thought to be an energy saving response to prevent ATP hydrolysis in response to low sugar levels ( kane , 1995 ) . A great deal is known about how this process is regulated in yeast , however a recent study has shown that when grown in neutral conditions the V - ATPase is resistant to dissociation ( Diakov & Kane , 2010 ) . This raises questions as to how ubiquitous this regulatory mechanism is , and if it is a yeast specific response only feasible due to their ability to withstand V - ATPase disruption . 29 1 . 6 . 2 V - ATPase and actin The V - ATPase was first documented to interact with actin by Lee et al . , in 1999 whilst studying V - ATPase localisation in osteoclasts . They showed that V - ATPase from mouse marrow or bovine kidney bound rabbit actin with a 0 . 05 µ M affinity . They also went on to confirm this interaction using electron microscopy of negatively stained samples showing V - ATPase bound to F - actin filaments . In a disrupted complex the B subunit was shown to bind actin ( Holliday et al . , 2000 ) , and this was later shown to be a direct interaction with a sequence bearing homology to profilin ( chen et al . , 2004 ) . Alteration of the sequence to that of a homologue for Pyrococcus horikoshii that does not have an actin cytoskeleton was found to disrupt actin binding ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Zuo et al . , 2008 ) . Disruption of the actin binding site in osteoclasts revealed it was an important interaction targeting of V - ATPase to ruffled membranes ( Zuo et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly it has also been observed in epididymis clear cells , involved in acidifying the extracellular space to maintain an environment for sperm maturation , that accumulation of V - ATPase at their plasma - membrane requires the depolymerisation of cortical F - actin suggesting that actin also has an inhibitory role in preventing plasma - membrane localisation ( Beaulieu et al . , 2005 ; Shum et al . , 2010 ) . Additionally the C subunit has also been shown to bind actin . The C subunit separates from both V 1 and V 0 after dissociation . The intact complex ( V 1 / V 0 ) was found to have a 2 - 3 fold higher affinity than just V 1 alone ( Vitavsk et al . , 2003 ) . Purified C subunits were later shown to bind both F - actin and G - actin with a dissociation constant of ~ 50nM ( Vitavsk et al . , 2005 ) 30 1 . 7 Dictyostelium discoideum Dictyostelium discoideum is natively a soil dwelling amoeba found feeding upon bacteria . It belongs to a class of ‘social amoeba’ , named due to a survival technique by which upon starvation they group to form a multicellular fruiting body . It has been popular as a model organism for the study of cell motility due to its active lifestyle . During its growth phase it is independent , existing as a single cell migrating in search of food sources . When these are depleted a developmental program is engaged . Figure 1 . 7 shows the lifecycle of Dictyostelium . Upon starvation surrounding cells migrate together forming aggregates that are capable of undergoing differentiation . After aggregation motile slugs are formed that migrate toward heat , light and humidity . As they migrate cells differentiate into pre - stalk or pre - spore cells . After the slug has settled the culmination stage begins , where pre - stalk cells vacuolise lifting up the spores forming a fruiting body . 1 . 7 . 1 As a model organism Dictyostelium discoideum is established as a model organism for the study of cell migration , and more recently gaining momentum in the areas of pathogenicity , autophagy , and vesicular trafficking . As an experimental system it benefits from being easily handled , genetically tractable , having a fully sequenced genome and that its growth phase is distinctly separated and independent from its developmental phase . 31 Figure 1 . 7 : Development cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum Image of the developmental cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum . Starting from bottom right and moving clockwise . Cells aggregate to form a loose aggregate , tight aggregate , tipped aggregate , an elongated structure called the finger , this topples to form a migratory slug , and then progresses through stages of culmination from the Mexican hat to a fully formed fruiting body . ( Image is a scanning electron microphraph by Blanton & Grimson ) 32 Dictyostelium naturally feed on bacteria by phagocytosis . Several strains have been generated that can be grown in liquid medium within the laboratory ( Sussman & Sussman , 1967 ) , These have acquired several mutations ( Williams et al . , 1974 ) , that confer an ability to take up nutrient rich medium by a process called macropinocytosis . This allows cells to be cultivated in defined medium in the absence of bacteria or particles , a trait historically beneficial for aiding biochemical experiments but more recently proving useful for live cell imaging . Genetically Dictyostelium are naturally found as haploids . This in combination with a method for transformation ( Nellen et al . , 1985 ) makes gene disruption a simple and rapid process . Additionally the genome has been sequenced and is freely available ( Eichinger et al . , 2005 ) . Given the genetic strengths of Dictyostelium several methods have been developed to further utilise this organism . Although there are a number of selection markers for use in Dictyostelium such as Blasticidin , Hygromycin and G418 , some are more effective than others at selecting gene disruptants , namely Blasticidin . The Cre - loxP recombination system used to create conditional gene disruptants in mice has been adapted for use in this system ( Faix et al . , 2004 ) . This enables generation of multiple gene disruptants using the same selection marker . This works by using selection cassettes flanked by loxP recombination sites and contain downstream translational stop codons . After successful gene disruption transient expression of Cre recombinase causes a recombination event excising the selection cassette but leaving the stop codons in place . This selection cassette can then be re - used for further gene disruptions in that cell line . 33 Another tool for generating multiple disruptants is the use of a diploid system ( King & Insall 2003 ) . If the desired disruptants already exist in different cell lines , providing each are resistant to a different selection when starved together they will fuse to form diploids at a frequency of 1 in 10 5 that can then be isolated by addition of both selections . This allows for specific mutants to be crossed . Providing each mutation resides on separate chromosomes these diploids can then be segregated back to haploids using microtubule disrupting drugs . Finally , libraries of Dictyostelium mutant strains can also be generated by the random insertion of a vector into the genome using restriction - enzyme - mediated integration ( REMI ) ( Kuspa et al . , 1994 ) . Generation of mutants in Dictyostelium does not require cells to undergo development . This allows mutants to be generated whose homologous in multicellular organisms when disrupted would be lethal due to defective development . 1 . 7 . 2 Endocytic pathway in Dictyostelium Dictyostelium is increasingly being utilised as a model system for the study of the endocytic pathway . It bears many similarities to that of its mammalian counterpart including mechanisms for uptake of membrane and material , early trafficking stages of acidic vesicles involving tabulation and vesiculation , formation of multi - vesicular bodies and lysosome biogenesis ( Neuhaus et al . , 2002 ; Marchetti et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally they also perform 34 lysosome secretion ( Dimond et al . , 1981 ) , a process carried out by a number of specialised cell types such macrophages , T cells , and osteoclasts . Similarities between these systems are also emphasised by a shared susceptibility to pathogenic microorganisms , such as Legionella , that escape the antimicrobial environment of lysosomes by hijacking the hosts endocytic trafficking machinery ( Solomon & Isberg . , 2000 ) . As single celled amoebae the emphasis of the endocytic pathway in Dictyostelium is the internalisation and trafficking of foreign material for nutrient uptake , and the expulsion of indigestible material . In Dictyostelium fluid and solid particles are engulfed by macropinocytosis and phagocytosis respectively . These two actin - dependent processes although morphologically similar ( Hacker et al . , 1997 ) have been shown to be regulated by different mechanisms ( reviewed in Cardelli , 2001 ) . Figure 1 . 8 shows key events that take place after internalisation by macropinocytosis . As the pathway is not linear , timings are a rough guide to the observed transit of fluid phase markers through the pathway . Newly internalised macropinosomes retain a residual actin - coat for ~ 1 minute ( Maniak et al . , 1995 ) . After this has disassembled , various endocytic vesicles fuse with the compartment delivering V - ATPase that acidifies the luminal space ( Padh et al . , 1991 ; Clarke et al . , 2010 ) . Membrane is then retrieved from this compartment in small carrier vesicles that return membrane back to the cell surface ( Neuhaus & Soldati , 2000 ) . These carrier vesicles were shown to selectively remove p25 from macropinosomes and return it to the plasma membrane similar to recycling endosomes in mammalian cells ( Ravanel et al . , 2001 ) , . These small carrier vesicles have a high surface to volume ratio , causing removal of membrane from the macropinosome whilst leaving the majority of the luminal contents . The decreasing size of the 35 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 7 8 9 Fission ( Budding ) Fusion Fission ( Fragmentation ) Maturation Time 1’ 30’ 60’ pH neutral neutral acidic Figure 1 . 8 : The endocytic pathway in Dictyostelium discoideum Represetation of fission / fussion events throughout the endocytic pathway in Dictyostelium . following macropinocytosis ( 1 ) Internalised macropinosome maintains a neutral pH and residual actin - coat for ~ 1 minute . ( 2 ) After the actin - coat is removed the vesicle begins to fuse with other endocytic compartments that deliver V ATPase to the membrane acidifying its lumen . ( 3 ) Carrier vesicles bud from this compartment selectively recycling transmembrane proteins and membrane back to the plasma - membrane . This compartment can also fragment intosmaller compartments . These compartments can also undergo homotypic fusion . ( 5 ) compartment looses ability to fuse with earlier compartments and receives a complement of hydrolytic enzymes .

Image adapted from Maniak 2003 ) . Actin coat Disassembling actin coat 3 36 macropinosome drives the expulsion of water concentrating membrane impermeant material inside the lumen ( Neuhaus et al . , 2002 ) . These vesicles are then capable of undergoing homotypic fusion , resulting in what has previously been termed a mixing compartment ( Clarke et al . , 2002 ) . This presumably serves to concentrate the contents of numerous macropinosomes into a smaller number of dense vesicles . These vesicles then lose the ability to undergo fusion with earlier compartments ( Clarke et al . , 2002 ) , and progress through a series of lysosomal stages each containing a specific profile of hydrolytic enzymes ( Souza et al . , 1997 ) . Further progression through the endocytic pathway is accompanied by an increase in luminal pH forming a post - lysosomal compartment ( Padh et al . , 1993 ; Aubry et al . , 1993 ) . This is achieved through removal of the V - ATPase that is then recycled back to acidify newly formed macropinosomes ( Nolta et al . , 1994 ; Clarke et al . , 2010 ) . These compartments then persist in the cell for ~ 30 minutes before fusing with the plasma - membrane expelling its contents into the extracellular space . Post - lysosomes in Dictyostelium have been shown to be surrounded by a coat of filamentous actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Rauchenberger et al . , 1997 ; Insall et al . , 2001 ) . Disruption of these actin coats by treatment with the actin depolymerising drug Latrunculin caused vesicles to aggregate into clusters and prevent further trafficking of endocytic markers ( Drengk et al . , 2003 ) . A unique approach was undertaken to specifically disrupt these actin - coats by creating a fusion between the actin depolymerising protein cofilin , and a previously identified marker of post - lysosomes vacuolin A ( Drengk et al . , 2003 ) . The construct successfully targeted cofilin to post - lysosomes increasing the rate of actin depolymerisation resulting in clustering 37 of post - lysosomes but normal trafficking of endocytic markers . The authors argued that these actin coats act as a physical barrier preventing docking and fusion events with other endocytic markers . By a similar strategy the actin binding protein VASP was targeted to these compartments increasing the size and density of the actin coats ( Schmauch et al . , 2009 ) . This was shown to sequester actin binding proteins to such an extent that phenotypes were observed resembling their individual knockouts . 1 . 8 Aims of this work The aim in this study is to further characterise the cellular function of the newly identified member of the WASP protein family , WASH . I will achieve this by utilising Dictyostelium discoideum as a model organism as its genetics allow easy disruption of the single gene encoding WASH , and the functional separation of its growth and development cycle may yield more success than previous studies using Drosophila . 38 Chapter 2 Materials and Methods All reagents / solutions were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated . 39 2 . 1 Cell culture 2 . 1 . 1 Axenic Cells were grown axenically in HL - 5 medium + Glucose ( Formedium ) at 22 ° C , either adhered to 10cm petri dishes or in suspension within shaken flasks rotating at 120rpm .

Proteins were then transferred from the gel to methanol soaked PVDF Hybond - P membrane ( Amersham ) in transfer buffer for 2 hours at 240mA using BioRad Mini - PROTEAN® Tetra Cell transfer apparatus . Membranes were then soaked in Ponceau S solution for 10 minutes followed by successive rounds of washes in TBST to confirm even protein loading . Blots were then blocked for at least one hour in TBST + 5 % powder milk ( w / v ) .

Two peptide sequences from WASH were selected and independently used to raise antibodies in rabbits . One sequence resides in the WHD1 domain at the N terminus ( FNTQENPYKKYSNT ) and the other within the WHD2 domain of the C terminus ( KADVGGDNGDGEGN ) . Antibodies were supplied with lyophilised peptide and this was used for affinity purification . Aliquots from the fourth and final bleed were used in affinity purification using a MicroLink® Peptide Coupling Kit ( Pierce ) according to manufacturer’s instructions .

The cells were then fixed with picric acid as described in Humbel & Biegelmann ( 1992 ) . In summary , cells were fixed with 2 % ( w / v ) formaldehyde , 15 % ( v / v ) concentrated picric acid , 10mM piperazine - N , N’ - bis2 - ethanesulfuric acid ( PIPES ) pH6 . 5 for 15 minutes . Coverslips were washed in PBS prior to post - fixation for two minutes with 70 % ethanol followed by sequential washes in PBS glycine . Fixative : 0 . 8g paraformaldehyde was added to 10ml dH 2 O ; 3 - 4 drops of 1M NaOH was then added , and the solution was heated at 42 ° C with occasional mixing until dissolved . The volume was adjusted to 14ml with dH 2 O , and aliquots of 1 . 75ml were frozen . 0 . 75ml saturated picric acid and 2 . 5ml 20mM PIPES was added to an aliquot of paraformaldehyde .

Cells were rinsed by successive washes with PBS prior to mounting upon glass slides using Prolong Gold ( Invitrogen ) . 53 2 . 7 Folate chemotaxis assay Observation of Dictyostelium cells migrating towards folate under a thin layer of agar was performed as previously described by Laevsky & Knecht ( 2001 ) . Three troughs roughly 2mm wide were cut into SM agar . The central trough was filled with 0 . 1mM folic acid , which diffuses out forming a gradient between its neighbouring troughs . Cells harvested from log phase of growth were added to the troughs either side of the folic acid at a density of 1x10 6 cells / ml . Using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope phase - contrast time - lapse movies were taken of cells as they moved under the agar towards the folate stimulus . Cells were imaged within 8 hours of adding the folic acid . 2 . 7 . 1 Cell speed quantification The mean speed of chemotaxing cells under agar was determined using the manual cell tracker plugin for ImageJ ( ImageJ : http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Time - lapse images were taken every 30 seconds for a period of 20 minutes . The centroid of the cell was estimated by eye on each frame and the xy coordinates used for calculating cell speed . 54 2 . 8 Endocytosis / Exocytosis assays Rates of fluid phase uptake and exocytosis were assessed in Dictyostelium cells by fluorometrically measuring intracellular levels of FITC conjugated Dextran as described by Rivero & Maniak ( 2006 ) . 2 . 8 . 1 Endocytosis Dictyostelium cells were harvested from shaken culture during log phase of growth . Flasks containing 10 ml of culture at 1x10 6 cells / ml were placed on a rotary shaker at 120rpm . 200 µ l of culture was pelleted and measured for protein content using PrecisionRed ( cytoskeleton ) . 20mg of FITC - Dextran was added to flasks and 500 µ l samples were removed at each time point . Samples were pelleted and washed twice with ice cold KK2 buffer and finally pelleted and stored on ice until all time points had been collected . Samples were measured for FITC content by resuspending cell pellets in lysis buffer and measuring emission at 515nm with 470nm excitation on a PTI fluorimeter . Results were normalised to protein content KK2 Buffer : 16mM KH 2 PO 4 ; 4mM K 2 HPO 4 . Lysis Buffer : 50mM Na2HPO4 ; pH9 . 3 ( adjusted with NaOH ) ; 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( v / v ) . 55 2 . 8 . 2 Exocytosis 10ml Shaken cultures at 1x10 6 cells / ml were incubated with HL5 medium containing 20mg FITC - dextran . Cultures were then pelleted and washed twice with HL5 medium and finally resuspened in 10ml of HL5 medium with FITC - dextran . Samples were collected and measured for FITC fluorescence as above . Values were normalised to the fluorescent value at time point 0 . 2 . 9 Growth rate assay Cultures were grown in shaken culture on a rotary shaker at 120rpm . Samples were periodically taken and analysed using a CASY® Technology Cell counter ( Roche Innovatis ) and the data exported using CASYexcell 2 . 2 . To measure the effects of dextran on axenic growth cells were cultivated in HL - 5 medium containing 20 % ( w / v ) dextran ( 65 – 90 KDa ) . Growth was assessed over a period of 5 days in which cultures exceeding 2x10 6 cells / ml were diluted down to 1x10 5 cells / ml with fresh medium . 56 2 . 10 Post - Lysosome visualisation Visualisation of Dictyostelium post - lysosomes was performed utilising FITC and TRITC conjugated dextran as previously described by Rivero & Maniak ( 2006 ) . Cells were seeded onto glass - bottomed dishes and incubated in LoFlo medium containing 4mg / ml FITC - Dextran and 40mg / ml TRITC - Dextran . After 60 minutes dishes were imaged on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope ( FITC : excitation 488 , emission 500 - 550 . TRITC : excitation 561 . 4 , emission 570 - 620 ) . Microscope settings were adjusted using wild type Ax2 cells so that a range of intracellular pH values could be visualised . These settings were not changed between subsequent cell types or dishes . Settings used were not sensitive enough to detect any WASH GFP fusions due to their low level of expression . This allowed these cell lines to still be used in this assay without the GFP signal interfering and yielding false positives . 2 . 11 Pulse chase experiments Wild type Ax2 cells were briefly incubated in LoFlo medium containing 4mg / ml FITC for either 10 or 20 minutes . After the pulse period the dish was rinsed with two rounds of fresh LoFlo medium , and imaged on an Olympus widefield fluorescence microscope at low magnification ( 40x objective ) . LatrunculinA was added to the dish at a final concentration of 2 µ M at various times during imaging . For washout experiments the dish was removed and 57 rinsed twice with fresh LoFlo medium and immediately returned to the microscope . Post - lysosomes were quantified with ImageJ using its built in Analyze Particles routine . 2 . 12 Agarose Beads Microscopic agarose beads were made by placing 100 µ l of molten 1 . 5 % agarose into 20ml of water saturated Butan - 1 - ol at 45 ° C . The mixture was placed in a sonicating water bath with ice and agitated by sonication and repetitive pipetting until the solution changed from transparent to opaque . The resulting beads underwent several rounds of washes in distilled water and finally passed through a 5 µ m filter . For fluorescent beads Oregon Green® conjugated dextran ( Invitrogen ) was added to molten agarose at 50 ° C before mixing with Butan - 1 - ol . 2 . 13 Microscopy DIC and Phase Contrast microscopy were performed on an inverted Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000 - E with a Retiga EXi ( QImaging ) camera . Timelapse data was captured using µ Manager 1 . 3 ( www . micro - manager . org ) . 58 Fixed samples were imaged on a Olympus IX81 with a Coolsnap HQ 2 ( photometrics ) camera captured using Velocity 5 . 1 ( PerkinElmer ) . The microscope was fitted with a piezo z stage for acquiring z steps for deconvolution . The acquisition setup was assessed for spherical aberrations by measuring point spread functions ( PSFs ) using PS - Speck tm microscope point source beads ( Invitrogen ) . After determining there were no spherical aberrations samples were deconvolved with Volocity 5 . 1 using a calculated PSF . Widefield live cell fluorescent imaging was performed on a custom built Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000 - U TIRF microscope . The CASCADEII ( Photometrics ) camera was fitted with a beam splitter for simultaneous imaging of GFP and mRFP . Time lapse movies were acquired using Metamorph ( Molecular Devices ) . Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti using NIS - Eliments AR3 . 1 for acquisition . 59 Chapter 3 Identifying a role for WASH in the endocytic pathway of Dictyostelium discoideum 60 WASH was identified by Linardopoulou et al . ( 2007 ) and belongs to a novel subgroup of the WASP protein family widely conserved amongst eukaryotic organisms . In vitro work on purified proteins showed that WASH enhanced the nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , a defining feature of WASP family proteins . However , their attempts to disrupt WASH in Drosophila yielded unviable larvae hindering further characterisation of its molecular role . The identification of a novel subgroup of the WASP protein family with no idea as to its cellular function raises a great deal of interest in the field of actin dynamics . 3 . 1 Identification of gene encoding WASH in Dictyostelium Linardopoulou et al ( 2007 ) identified the human gene MGC520000 as a new subgroup of the WASP protein family and as a result renamed the coded protein WASH ( W ASP A nd S CAR H omologue ) . A BLAST search using the Drosophila WASH homologue was performed against the Dictyostelium genome with a single homologue being identified coding by the gene DDB _ G0292878 . In keeping with the naming convention of Dictyostelium genes , DDB _ G0292878 will now be referred to as wshA . Figure 1 . 1 shows a sequence alignment of Dictyostelium WASH against homologues from other organisms , including Homo sapiens and the disrupted Drosophila homologue . 61 D . discoideum E . histolytica H . sapien X . tropicalis D . melanogaster D . discoideum E . histolytica H . sapiens X . tropicalis D . melanogaster D . discoideum E . histolytica H . sapiens X . tropicalis D . melanogaster D . discoideum E . histolytica H . sapiens X . tropicalis D . melanogaster D . discoideum E . histolytica H . sapiens X . tropicalis D . melanogaster D . discoideum E . histolytica H . sapiens X . tropicalis D . melanogaster C domain A domain V ( WH2 ) domain Poly - proline domain WAHD1 domain WAHD2 domain / tubulin binding region 62 Figure 3 . 1 : Alignment of WASH homologues .

Figure 3 . 2 : A depicts the initial approach used to disrupt wshA . A DNA construct ( pMJC07 ) was designed to insert a Blasticidin resistance ( BSR ) cassette half way into the genomic sequence of wshA by homologous recombination . In addition 29bp of coding sequence was removed to safeguard against genomic or mRNA rearrangements resulting in a full length wshA transcript . Wildtype Ax2 cells were transfected with pMJC07 , from which 48 transformants were screened . Two successful recombinants ( MC1 and MC2 ) were identified . Successful recombinants could be distinguished from random integrants by PCR of wshA from genomic DNA , yielding a product ~ 3kb compared to the parental 1 . 5kb band ( Figure 3 . 2 : B ) . This increase is due to the successful insertion of the BSR cassette ( ~ 1 . 4kb ) into the middle of the genomic wshA gene . To detect the presence of endogenous WASH , antibodies were raised against two different peptide sequences , one towards the N terminus and the other within the VCA domain of the C terminus ( Figure 3 . 3 : B ) . Both antibodies were affinity purified and used to probe Western blots of lysates from parental ( Ax2 ) and MC1 cells ( figure 3 . 3 : A ) . Blots revealed the loss of a 60kDa band from MC1 lysate with both N and C terminal antibodies . WASH is predicted to have a molecular weight of 51kDa , however , some factors such as post - translational modifications and residual secondary structure can cause proteins to run at higher molecular weights than predicted . As both antibodies are targeted to different epitopes the loss of the 60KDa band in each blot likely represents the loss of full length WASH . An additional band was observed in blots of MC1 lysates when probed with the N terminal antibody ( Figure 3 . 2 : B ) . This additional band ran at ~ 26KDa , roughly 43 % the size of full 64 Wild Type pMJC07 Figure 3 . 2 : Generation of wshA disruptant using pMJC07 .

The coding sequence upstream of the BSR insertion site accounts for 41 % of the full length sequence suggesting this region is still being translated . Concerns that the truncated protein expressed in MC1 cells may hinder interpretation of experimental results due to residual functionality required that a new cell line be created . Cell line MC4 was generated using the gene disruptant construct pMJC57 which utilises genes upstream ( DDB _ G0292876 ) and downstream ( DDB _ 0292972 ) of wshA as recombination arms ( Figure 3 . 4 : A ) . This allowed removal of 86 % of wshA sequence , and the engineering of a point mutation augmenting the start codon from ATG to ATT . Wild type Ax2 cells were transfected with pMJC57 , from which 48 transformants were screened by western blot , identifying one successful recombinant ( MC4 ) . MC4 showed loss of a 60KDa band when probed with both N and C terminal antibodies showing the loss of full length WASH ( Figure 3 . 4 : B ) . No truncated protein was observed . All future work and references to wshA null indicates use of cell line MC4 . It should be noted that all experiments in chapter 3 and section 4 . 1 and 4 . 3 were also performed using cell lines MC1 and MC2 yielding identical results . All references to parental cell lines indicate the use of wild type Ax2 cells . Cells where the constructs targeted to disrupt wshA had randomly integrated into the genome were briefly observed to display similar characteristic as wildtype Ax2 cells . 67 N TerminalAntibodyC TerminalAntibody 52 kDa 76 kDa 38 kDa 31 kDa 24 kDa P a r en t M C 4 P a r en t M C 4 Figure 3 . 4 : Generation of wshA disruptant using pMJC57 ( A ) Schematic representation of method for targeted disruption of wshA using DNA construct pMJC57 .

Laboratory cell strains are typically maintained in axenic culture , and when grown in suspension growth rate and cell size distribution are easily monitored . Shaken cultures were periodically measured using a CASY counter ensuring cultures stayed above 1 x 10 5 and below 5 x10 6 cells / ml . Changes in population density were used to calculate average generation times for parental and wshA null cells . Measured results indicated a small change in growth rate after disruption of WASH , however this could not be substantiated with statistics and was not significantly different ( p value = 0 . 13 ; t - test ) ( Figure 3 . 5A ) . Figure 3 . 5 : B shows a representative cell size distribution from parental and wshA null culture samples , as well as representative images of cells grown in shaken culture placed on glass - bottomed dishes and imaged by DIC microscopy . No gross changes were observed in population distribution or cell morphology of spread cells . Given there were no significant changes in generation time or cell size , disruption of WASH appears to have little effect on cell growth or division . 69 A Parent Cell Diameter ( μ m ) C e ll C oun t P e r ce n t a g e 0 5 10 15 20 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 0 5 10 15 20 wshA 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 null B Figure 3 . 5 : Growth of Parental and wshA null cells in axenic shaken culture Showing no difference in growth between parental and wshA null cells grown in suspension shaken cultures .

During screening of wshA disruptants cells were seeded onto bacterial lawns as a way of ensuring that cell strains are clonal . During this process it was noticed that wshA null cells showed a noticeable defect when grown upon bacterial lawns . Dictyostelium utilise a range of cellular processes when growing on bacteria lawns including phagocytosis , cytokinesis , and chemotaxis , all of which have previously been documented to utilise the actin cytoskeleton ( See Introduction ) . Any of these if perturbed would be predicted to yield visual signs when cultivated on bacterial lawns . Dictyostelium were clonally seeded onto lawns of Klebsiella and incubated in humidity chambers at room temperature for 72 hours . Each cell seeded onto this lawn undergoes successive rounds of bacterial consumption , growth and division . As bacteria become scarce the cells migrate outward to locate and consume more bacteria . Over time this results in an expanding circular plaque as the bacteria are consumed . Figure 3 . 6 shows that at comparable time points wshA null cells have noticeably smaller plaques than parental cells . Given wshA null cells grew normally in axenic culture this indicated that disruption of WASH could be hindering either chemotaxis or phagocytosis . 71 Parent wshA null Figure 3 . 6 : Growth of parental and wshA null cells on bacterial lawns Parent and wshA null cells were clonally seeded onto Klebsiella bacterial lawns . Images were taken after 72 hours of incubation . This shows that wshA null cells producenoticably smaller plaques than wildtype cells at comparable time points . 72 3 . 5 wshA null cells have increased cellular motility It had previously been shown that disruption of SCAR in Dictyostelium also resulted in defects when grown upon a bacterial lawn ( Pollitt & Insall 2008 ) . SCAR is involved in generating actin in cellular protrusions , disruption of which results in reduced cellular motility ( Blagg et al . , 2003 ) . Cell motility requires the concerted efforts of several actin dependent processes , such as cellular protrusion ( Miyata et al . , 1999 ) and myosin aided contraction ( Iwadate & Yumura , 2008 ) . Therefore the effect of WASH disruption on motility was measured . The migration of cells towards bacteria can be simulated in an optically favourable setting by observing axenic cells migrating under a layer of agarose towards folate . Using phase contrast time - lapse microscopy , chemotaxing cells were observed and cell speed was quantified ( Figure 3 . 7 ) . In this assay WASH was not required for cells to detect and migrate up the folate gradient ( See supplementary movie 1 and 2 ) . Interestingly however the disruption of WASH resulted in significantly faster migrating cells ( p = 0 . 001 ; t - test ) . This is not a phenotype expected from disruption of actin machinery involved in cellular protrusions or retraction , and it is not clear how an increase in cell speed would yield a decrease in plaque size upon bacterial lawns . However , the phenotype of increased cell speed following gene disruption has been observed before with the disruption of RasS and gefB ( Chubb et al . , 2000 ) . This previously demonstrated that wild type cells do not migrate at the fastest possible speed and that perturbing other processes can enhance migrational speed . This suggests that the increased speed may well be a secondary effect from the disruption of some other WASH related process . 73 Figure 3 . 7 : Cell speed of Parental and wshA null cells during folate chemotaxis . Graph depicting quantified average cell speed of cells migrating under a layer of agarose up a gradient of folate . wshA null cells were shown to migrate significantly faster than that of parental cells ( p value = 0 . 001 ) .

Error bars represent standard error . 0 5 10 15 20 C e ll s p ee d ( µ m / m i n ) Parent wshA null * p = 0 . 001 74 During the course of measuring cellular motility several cytokinesis events were observed for both parental and wshA null cells . Cytokinesis is also a process known to involve the actin cytoskeleton . Figure 3 . 7 shows still images from representative movies of cells dividing on glass - bottomed dishes under a layer of agar , however no gross defect was seen when comparing wshA null cells to parental , visually confirming findings from axenic growth experiments . 3 . 6 wshA null cells have normal endocytosis In order to further determine the cause of the bacterial growth defect we looked at macropinocytosis and phagocytosis , both of which are actin - dependent processes required for the uptake of fluid and solid objects respectively . A defect in phagocytosis but not in endocytosis could explain the discrepancy between normal axenic growth rates yet a clear defect when cultured upon bacterial lawns . Phagocytosis was indirectly assessed by briefly incubating cells adhered to glass - bottomed dishes with S . cerevisiae . The yeast are relatively large creating a more challenging obstacle to uptake in comparison to bacteria , and also making them easily identifiable after phagocytosis using DIC microscopy . Figure 3 . 9 : A shows images of parental and wshA null cells after 15 minutes incubation , showing wshA null cells possessed a similar quantity of phagocytosed yeast particles . This indicated no major defect in phagocytosis . Macropinocytosis was quantitatively assessed by measuring the cellular accumulation of fluorescently conjugated dextran over time .

Cells were grown in shaking culture and following addition of FITC - dextran monitored for intracellular fluorescence levels ( ex : 470 , em : 515 ) . Readings were normalised based on culture protein content prior to addition of FITC - dextran . Error bars represent standard error from triplicate experiments . 79 medium of shaken cultures , samples were periodically taken and used to measure the cellular FITC levels using a fluorimeter ( Excitation : 470nm ; Emission 515nm ) . Figure 3 . 9 : B shows accumulation of FITC - dextran in parental and wshA null cells over time . Disruption of WASH showed no measurable difference in fluid - phase uptake . 3 . 7 wshA null cells have a defect in exocytosis Although no difference was seen in the rate of fluid phase uptake between parental and wshA null cells , during the course of this experiment an unanticipated observation was made . Measuring the cellular accumulation of FITC - dextran only gives an accurate readout of endocytic uptake during the first 60 minutes . After this the earliest engulfed dextran will have traversed the endocytic pathway and begun to have been expelled . As the rate of exocytosis approaches that of endocytosis the cellular level of internalised FITC - dextran reaches equilibrium . Figure 3 . 10 : A shows the fluid - phase uptake assay with extended time points . Interestingly , unlike the parental cell line that clearly shows a plateau after 90 minutes wshA null cells continue to accumulate dextran at the same rate of endocytosis even at the last collected time point of 5 hours . This strongly suggests a defect in exocytosis of ingested material . To more directly confirm a defect in exocytosis shaken cultures were incubated for > 4 hours in HL - 5 medium containing FITC - dextran to saturate the endocytic pathway . The growth medium was then replaced with HL - 5 medium without FITC - dextran and the cellular level of 80 FITC was measured over time . Figure 3 . 10 : B shows the level of cellular fluorescence ( ex : 470 , em : 515 ) over time with fluorescence values normalised to the initial fluorescence level . It shows that parental cells after 1 hour have less than 50 % of their initial fluorescence level , and by two hours ~ 20 % . At comparable time points wshA null cells have > 90 % with only a marginal drop even after 5 hours . To confirm that the loss of WASH was responsible for the observed defect in exocytosis , WASH was re - introduced into wshA null cells . Two constructs were generated to express exogenous WASH . Both contained a GFP tag at their N terminus , one construct expressed full length WASH ( GFP - WASH ) and the other a truncation removing the arp2 / 3 activating VCA domain ( GFP - WASH ∆ VCA ) . Figure 3 . 11 shows western blots from lysates of wshA null cells expressing these constructs . Even protein loading was confirmed with Ponceau S solution during blotting and is also clearly visible by the nonspecific bands when probed with the N terminal antibody ( Figure 3 . 11 : A ) . Both N and C terminal antibodies were used to show that both constructs are successfully overexpressed in wshA null cell , and the loss of the VCA domain in GFP - WASH ∆ VCA is confirmed by the presence of a band in the cell lysate only when probed with the N terminal antibody ( Figure 3 . 11 : B ) . The exocytosis defect in wshA null cells is fully rescued by the over - expression of GFP - WASH ( Figure 3 . 12 ) . This confirms that exocytosis of dextran is dependent upon WASH , and that WASH can functionally tolerate an N terminal GFP fusion . Expression of GFP - WASH ∆ VCA failed to rescue the defect showing that the function of WASH in the endocytic pathway is dependent upon its ability to activate the arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3 . 12 ) . 81 Figure 3 . 10 : Exocytosis of FITC - dextran in parental and wshA null cells .

The endocytoic pathway of cells was loaded with FITC - dextran , and following its removal from the medium cells were monitored for decreasing intracellular fluorescence ( ex : 470 , em : 515 ) . Expression of GFP - WASH [ ∆ ] rescued the defect in exocytosis where as the expression of GFP - WASH Δ VCA [ ▲ ] did not . This shows that exocytosis of dextran is WASH dependent and requires its arp2 / 3 activation domain . 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time ( minutes ) % o f i n i t i a l f l u o re s ce n ce wshA null cells GFP - WASH GFP - WASH Δ VCA 85 3 . 8 Effect of defective exocytosis on growth rate A defect in exocytosis from the endocytic pathway provides a possible explanation regarding the discrepancy between the growth defect upon bacteria and normal axenic growth . Postulating that growth upon bacteria results in the consumption of a larger amount of indigestible material in comparison to axenic HL5 medium , and that in wshA null cells this material accumulates hindering growth , cultures were grown in HL - 5 medium containing indigestible 20 % ( w / v ) dextran and observed for growth abnormalities ( Figure 3 . 13 : A ) . After 4 days growth in shaken culture containing 20 % dextran both parental and wshA null cells showed a statistically significant increase in generation time ( p = < 0 . 05 ; T - test ) . However , the differences in these increases were much larger in wshA null cells resulting in a doubling in generation time in comparison with only a 10 % increase in parental cells ( p value = 0 . 001 ; T - test ) . We also noted that the presence of dextran had clear effects on whole cell and intracellular vesicle size . Figure 3 . 14 : A shows the percentage cell size distribution of representative samples from cells after 4 days growth with or without dextran . Dextran has a clear effect in wshA null cells , broadening the cell size distribution resulting in larger cells ( Figure 3 . 14 : A ) . This was not seen in parental cells , where the presence of dextran was surprisingly observed to result in a narrowing of the distribution indicating an increase in uniformity . This may have implications on tissue culture implying that the addition of dextran to axenic medium may help reduce cell variability . When these cells were observed spreading on a solid surface with DIC microscopy , wshA null cells showed dramatically enlarged intracellular compartments not observed in parental cells under similar conditions , or in parental or wshA null cells without 86 dextran ( Figure 3 . 14 ) . This demonstrates that failure to expel indigestible material can have secondary effects on growth , potentially due to the disruption of processes such as cytokinesis by an overcrowding of the cytoplasm with distended vesicles 87 A Figure 3 . 13 : Effect of 20 % dextran on generation time of parental and wshA null cells .

It removes doubts over residual expression levels continually troubling siRNA studies and questions of cell type specificity from multicellular organisms . However , care should be taken when generating knockout strains in Dictyostelium . It is common practice within the field to disrupt genes by inserting a selection cassette into the genomic coding sequence in the belief that the resulting transcript will be unstable and subsequently degraded . Expression of a truncated WASH protein in MC1 cells shows that this is not always the case . A default strategy should be the use of an upstream gene as a recombination arm allowing removal of the start codon and reducing the amount of upstream coding sequence of the targeted gene . Disruption of WASH was shown not to have any direct negative effects on endocytosis , cellular growth , cytokinesis or cell motility , but was shown to be essential for exocytosis of indigestible material from the endocytic pathway . This is an observation that has not been seen with any other members of the WASP protein family suggesting WASH is functionally distinct from , and whose loss cannot be compensated for by other members of the WASP family . Surprisingly a block in exocytosis is not lethal . The endocytic pathway functions to take up nutrients and involves the equivalent of internalising the entire plasma membrane every 4 - 10 minutes ( Aguado - Velasco & Bretscher , 1999 ) . As no change was seen in growth rate or cell size in the absence of dextran , membrane retrieval and degradative pathways of 91 the endocytic pathway must remain intact . For clarity , from this point on the defect in wshA null cells will be referred to a defect in defecation , to distinguish it from other membrane fusion events that must still occur . Since this work was undertaken several papers have been published identifying roles for WASH in the endocytic pathway of mammalian cell lines . Knockdown experiments showed subtle defects in transferrin recycling ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) , retromer - mediated CI - MPR trafficking ( Gomez & Billadeau , 2009 ) and enlargement and elongation of endosomes ( Duleh & Welch , 2010 ) . The observed defecation defect in wshA null cells is not a direct measurement of the exocytosis process itself , but evidence of a defect somewhere along the endocytic pathway , suggesting an evolutionary functional conservation between Dictyostelium and mammalian WASH supporting its use as a model organism . Depletion of WASH also had an unexpected increase in the rate of cellular motility . WASP protein family members act as positive regulators of actin assembly , and it is not clear how disruption of which can result in increased motility . However , it has previously been reported that the disruption of either RasS or gefB results in increased cellular speed ( Chubb et al . , 2000 ) . In this study the authors argue that these proteins control the proportion of actin involved in macropinocytosis and motility , and there disruption results in more actin machinery available for motility processes . This showed that wild type cells do not already move at a maximum possible speed . Although disruption of WASH had no effect on fluid phase uptake , showing that the WASH specific defect is unrelated to RasS and gefB pathways , by a similar logic disruption of WASH may perturb other processes that clearly accelerates cellular motility . 92 Chapter 4 WASH - dependent actin formation is essential for post - lysosome formation . 93 The actin cytoskeleton has previously been shown to interact with internal organelles . However , to date its role has primarily been associated with vesicle translocation by actin - comet tail formation ( Merrifield et al . , 1999 ) actin cables for myosin aided movement ( Aschenbrenner et al . , 2003 ) , or actin - coats as physical barriers to vesicle fusion ( Drengk et al . , 2003 ) . The discovery of WASH as a nucleation promoting factor involved in the endocytic pathway of Dictyostelium could advance the understanding of the role of actin in vesicular trafficking . 4 . 1 WASH is required for formation of actin - coats surrounding endocytic vesicles We previously showed that WASH was essential for trafficking of indigestible material through the endocytic pathway , and that this was dependent upon its VCA domain which is known to initiate actin nucleation through activation of the arp2 / 3 complex . To better understand the role of WASH - dependent actin in the endocytic pathway , F - actin structures in wshA null and parental cells were compared for differences . Cells were fixed using formaldehyde and stained with fluorescently labelled phalloidin , which specifically binds and stabilises filamentous actin . Cells were then visualised using widefield fluorescence microscopy . Cells lacking WASH were seen to be completely devoid of internal spherical actin structures that appear to be actin - coats surrounding post - lysosomes , previously described by Rauchenberger et al . , ( 1997 ) . Although these actin - coats were observable by eye down the microscope , they were often dim and at times masked due to the blurred light from the much brighter signal of nearby cortical actin . Iterative deconvolution was used to improve 94 the visualisation of these structures . This process reassigns the convolved light back to its source mathematically , requiring multiple images focused at incremental Z positions for each field of view , and a calculated point spread function based on the emission wavelength of the fluorophore and the optics of the microscope . Figure 4 . 1 : A shows deconvolved images of parental and wshA null cells showing actin coated vesicles ( arrows ) that are lost upon WASH depletion . These were counted , excluding any spherical structures in contact with cortical actin as being macropinosomes . Parental cells contain on average 3 - 4 actin - coats per cell ( Figure 4 . 1 : B ) , but from rigorous quantification of 86 cells , and casually observing many more since , wshA null cells were never observed to contain a single actin - coated vesicle . Exogenously expressing GFP - WASH in wshA null cells was previously shown to rescue the defect in defecation , demonstrating that WASH was not hindered by the presence of an N terminal GFP tag . Therefore we fixed cells expressing GFP - WASH and GFP - WASH ∆ VCA to observe their cellular localisation . GFP - WASH rescued the loss of actin - coats in wshA null cells and localised to the same vesicular compartments implying a direct role in its formation ( Figure 4 . 2 : A ) . This was also shown by the expression of GFP - WASH ∆ VCA . This construct did not rescue the loss of actin coats but its localisation was similar to GFP - WASH , showing that the vesicles that possess actin - coats in parental cells are still present , but their lack of actin - coats is due to the loss of WASH - dependent arp2 / 3 activation . This data shows that WASH is a nucleation promoting factor responsible for driving the formation of actin - coats around post - lysosomes in Dictyostelium . It has been the consensus that the domains within the N terminus of WASP family proteins control their localisation and 95 A B 0 1 2 3 4 5 A c t i n c o a t e d v e s i c l e s / c e ll Parent wshA null Figure 4 . 1 : Visualising F - actin structures in parental and wshA null cells after fixation ( A ) Deconvolved images of fixed cells labelled with TexasRed - Phalloidin to visualise F - actin .

A B 97 regulation whilst the C terminal is the active region . Although this does primarily appear to be the case with WASH , shown by a C terminal truncation resulting in loss of function yet retention of vesicular localisation , it was noted that a sub - population of these cells showed a strong nuclear localisation ( see Figure 4 . 2 : B ) suggesting the C terminus also has roles in the spatial distribution of WASH . 4 . 2 WASH possesses a nuclear export signal in its C region The observation that removal of the VCA domain could at times result in the nuclear accumulation of GFP - WASH suggested the presence of a nuclear export signal ( NES ) within this region . Linardopoulou et al . , ( 2007 ) suggested WASH may have possible roles in the nucleus due to conserved nuclear import and export signals with vertebrate WASH homologous . To confirm if Dictyostelium WASH contains a NES within its VCA domain cells expressing GFP - WASH were incubated with an inhibitor of nuclear export to see if its cellular localisation phenocopies that of the VCA truncated construct . Cells were treated with 10ng / ml of Leptomycin B , a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 that when disrupted blocks nuclear export of proteins containing nuclear export signals . Figure 4 . 3 shows the percentage of GFP - WASH or GFP - WASH ∆ VCA expressing cells showing nuclear accumulation , seen by fluorescence microscopy . It shows that deletion of the VCA domain resulted in 33 % of cells showing nuclear accumulation in comparison to 0 % with full length WASH . Leptomycin B treatment of cells expressing GFP - WASH phenocopied that of the VCA truncated construct , with 32 % of cells showing nuclear accumulation .

Figure 4 . 4 shows a graphic representation of the nuclear export signal ( NES ) score for each amino acid in the WASH sequence . A nuclear export signal is predicted if this score is above a set threshold ( green line ) . A nuclear export signal was predicted within the C motif of the VCA domain of Dictyostelium WASH , consistent with experimental data . To see if this was a conserved feature of the C motif other WASH homologues were also assessed for putative nuclear export signals . No nuclear export signals were predicted within the C regions , with the exception of S . mollendorffii , however it was common for this region to generate a nuclear export signal score just below the threshold for identification . The high frequency of this pattern would suggest that this could be a common trait of the C motif but the predictive software may be quite cautious in its predictions . Other WASP family members in Dictyostelium were also tested for predicted nuclear export signals in their C region showing a confirmed prediction for SCAR but not WASP ( Figure 4 . 5 ) . 4 . 3 WASH is required for post - lysosome formation Actin - coats surrounding endocytic compartments have been described previously in Dictyostelium ( Rauchenberger et al . , 1997 ) . They had been shown to form around late endocytic vesicles , called post - lysosomes that are characterised by a neutral pH ( Padh et al . , 1993 ) . Having identified WASH as the NPF responsible for actin - coat formation we set out to determine the consequences of its disruption on post - lysosomes . 100 Dictyostelium discoideum Homo sapiens Mus musculus Drosophila melanogaster Caenorhabditis elegans Entamoeba histolytica X . tropicalis Trichoplax adhaerens Selaginella moellendorffii C domain 421 - 441 404 - 424 412 - 433 434 - 453 450 - 469 380 - 397 409 - 428 412 - 432 400 - 419 XP _ 629407 NP _ 878908 NP _ 081109 NP _ 610739 NP _ 496847 XP _ 656631 NP _ 001016854 XP _ 002113304 XP _ 002961017 101 Figure 4 . 4 : Predicted nuclear export signal in WASH homologues Graphs showing predicted nuclear export signals ( NES ) from multiple WASH homologues using NetNes .

TRITC - dextran is pH insensitive and acts as a marker for fluorescently visualising the entire endocytic pathway , revealing the size and shape of endocytic compartments . The intensity of its fluorescent signal is dependent upon concentration . FITC - dextran is pH sensitive with its fluorescent signal decreasing with decreasing pH . Changes in the ratio between FITC and TRITC signal therefore indicate a relative pH change ( Rivero & Maniak , 2006 ) . Early macropinosomes are large and have varying morphology with similar pH and dextran concentration as the surrounding medium . As they mature the luminal pH drops and membrane retrieval results the compartment decreasing in size locally concentrating the dextran . These later fuse with other endocytic vesicles eventually resulting in large , highly concentrated spherical compartments . The last and most noticeable change is upon the formation of post - lysosomes , where the large highly concentrated compartments have a sudden increase in luminal pH ( neutralisation ) . Figure 4 . 6 shows representative images of cells incubated in FITC and TRITC conjugated dextran for 1 hour and imaged by confocal microscopy . The red and green channels show TRITC and FITC emissions respectively . An overlay results in acidic vesicles appearing red whilst neutralised post - lysosomes look yellow or green . Disruption of WASH shows a complete loss of post - lysosomes that are clearly visible in parental cells ( arrows ) . Cells lacking WASH still contained large concentrated acidic vesicles indicative of lysosomes . Like previously observed defects of defecation and loss of actin - coats , expression of GFP - WASH rescued the loss of post - lysosomes and this was dependent upon its VCA domain ( Figure 4 . 6 ) . 104 Parent wshA null wshA null [ GFP - WASH ] wshA null [ GFP - WASH Δ VCA ] Figure 4 . 6 : Visualisation of post - lysosomes in parental and wshA null cells Cells were loaded with FITC ( pH sensitive ) and TRITC ( pH insensitive ) conjugated dextran to differentiate between acidic and neutral vesicles . Acidic vesicles appear red due to the decreased FITC signal , whilst neutral vesicles are yellow or green ( arrows ) . wshA null cells lack post - lysosomes that can be seen in parental cells , and this can be rescued by expression of GFP - WASH but not GFP - WASH Δ VCA . Scale bars show 10 μ m . 105 In addition , two other GFP constructs were created to attempt to disrupt WASH function whilst retaining its NES within the C motif . Expression of GFP - WASH ∆ A where the acidic region was removed failed to rescue the appearance of post - lysosomes showing this region is essential for WASH function ( Figure 4 . 7 ) . Within the acidic region of WASP family proteins there is a conserved tryptophan . Experiments showed that mutation of this residue to alanine reduces the efficiency of arp2 / 3 binding activation in vitro ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . The lack of function of the Drosophila WHAMM has also been attributed to its loss of its C terminal tryptophan ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Expression of GFP - WASHW471A in wshA null cells resulted in formation of neutral post - lysosomes . This data shows that WASH and the actin - coats it nucleates are responsible for the formation or maintenance of neutral post - lysosomes in Dictyostelium . This suggests two possibilities . Firstly , WASH - dependent actin may act as a physical barrier ( Drengk et al . , 2003 ) preventing re - acidification of post - lysosomes by fusion with acidic compartments , and its disruption prevents the cell from maintaining any neutral vesicles . Secondly , WASH dependent actin may have an earlier function in the endocytic pathway than previously thought , and its disruption blocks the initial formation of post - lysosomes . The first hypothesis was tested using an actin depolymerizing drug , Latrunculin A . This drug binds to actin monomers depleting the pool of G - actin resulting in F - actin disassembly ( Spector et al . , 1982 ) . To see if neutral post - lysosomes re - acidify without an actin - coat Latrunculin A was added to parental dishes 1 hour into the post - lysosome visualisation assay . After 15 minutes of treatment cells had rounded up indicative of disruption of cellular F - actin . In these cells post - lysosomes could still be seen ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . This suggests that actin - coats are not required to maintain a neutral pH . This experiment however does not rule out that re - acidification may also be actin dependent , and would require a method to specifically disrupt WASH function on demand after the formation 106 Figure 4 . 7 : Effect of an acidic region deletion or tryptophan point mutation on WASH dependent post - lysosome formation Vesicle neutralisation assay .

Post - lysosomes appear yellow ( arrows ) and are absent in wshA null cells . Exogenous expression of WASH Δ A failed to rescue the loss of post - lysosomes . Deletion of the conserved tryptophanin the acidic region to alanine ( W471A ) was capable of rescuing the phenotype showing that the acidic domain is essential for function whereas the conserved tryptophan is not . Scale bar shows 10 μ m . 108 Pre - treatement 2 μ M Latrunculin A ( 15 min ) Figure 4 . 8 : Effect of latrunculin A on maintaining neutralised post - lysosomes Cells were loaded with FITC ( pH sensitive ) and TRITC ( pH insensitive ) conjugated dextran to differentiate between acidic and neutral vesicles . Acidic vesicles appear red due to the decreased FITC signal , whilst neutral vesicles are yellow or green . Images show presence of neutral post - lysosomes after 1 hour of incubation in fluorescently labelled dextran and these remain even after treatment of cells with 2 μ M latrunculin A . Scale bars show 10 μ m . 109 of post - lysosomes to conclusively rule this out . 4 . 4 Actin is required for post - lysosome formation To test the hypothesis that actin - coats are important for post - lysosome formation , the effect of latrunculin A on lysosome neutralisation was assessed in parental ( wshA + ) cells . Two problems needed to be overcome to test this hypothesis . Firstly , treatment with latrunculin A disrupts all cellular F - actin structures indiscriminately . Some of these have earlier roles than WASH in the endocytic pathway , and disruption of these would prevent dextran markers reaching lysosomes . Therefore a pulse chase experiment was devised allowing cells to internalise dextran and traffic it unhindered prior to latrunculin A treatment . Secondly , this experiment required an accurate prediction of when lysosome neutralisation would occur , otherwise an absence of post - lysosomes following latrunculin A addition could not be credited to drug treatment with any degree of confidence . Cells were incubated in medium containing FITC - dextran for 20 minutes . Following replacement with non - fluorescent medium cells were monitored by fluorescence time - lapse microscopy for the appearance of FITC in post - lysosomes identified by a sudden increase in fluorescence signal . Cells were monitored at low magnification ensuring at least 30 cells were in the field of view . Figure 4 . 9 shows the number of FITC - dextran containing post - lysosomes 110 in the field of view during the course of imaging , with the x axis denoting time from the commencement of the pulse chase . It was observed that within a population there was a surge of post - lysosomes formed containing FITC - dextran around ~ 40 minutes after the initial addition of FITC - dextran . It should be noted that this time is dependent upon the setup of the microscope and thresholds set during image processing , however from 3 repeats it was seen that this 40 minute onset was reproducible using identical parameters . The consistency of this observation provided a suitable target for the addition of Latrunculin A . We decided to add latrunculin A 36 minutes after commencement of the experiment giving several minutes for the drug to diffuse and sequester actin monomers prior to the predicted onset of lysosome neutralisation . Figure 4 . 9 shows that addition of latrunculin A at 36 minutes was sufficient to block the formation of post - lysosomes . This block was also shown to be reversible by removal of latrunculin A , with neutralisation commencing after a short recovery period . Although the addition and removal of latrunculin A appears to have affected the rate of formation and their persistence within the cell , this can be attributed to an inability to completely remove all latrunculin A during washes . The initial onset of vesicle neutralisation is indicated on Figure 4 . 9 by red lines . It is of importance to note these points are offset by roughly the same time period as latrunculin A treatment . 111 0 10 20 30 40 0 50 100 150 200 D e x t r an 0 10 20 30 40 0 50 100 150 200 D e x t r an Time ( minutes ) La t r un c u li n A N e u t r a li se d ves i c l es Figure 4 . 9 : Effect of latrunculin A on vesicle neutralisation Wildtype Ax2 cells were pulse chased with FITC - Dextran and its transit into neutralised post - lysosomes was measured by time lapse microscopy .

Red lines indicate the commencement of vesicle neutralisation 112 4 . 5 Conclusions This work shows that WASH is the NPF responsible for the formation of actin - coats around late endocytic vesicles in Dictyostelium . Previously the role of these actin - coats were largely unknown but were proposed to function as physical barriers to prevent vesicle tethering and fusion . This was due to studies in mammalian cells showing that cortical actin functions as a physical barrier and must first be locally disrupted for exocytosis ( Muallem et al . , 1995 ) . Additionally , by increasing the rate of actin - coat depolymerisation in Dictyostelium Drengk et al . , ( 2003 ) observed a clustering of post - lysosomes . Here we show that actin - coats function further upstream than previously thought with roles in post - lysosome formation . Actin - coats persist during the transit of post - lysosomes through the endocytic pathway , roughly 30 minutes ( Rauchenberger et al . , 1997 ) . As this coat remains for roughly 30 minutes after neutralization it could also serve a secondary function in preventing vesicle tethering and fusion as previously proposed ( Drengk et al . , 2003 ) , and this may be required to maintain neutrality . The loss of actin - coats presumably accounts for the defect in defecation seen in wshA null cells due to a block in vesicle maturation . Interestingly , it has been documented that actin associates with secretory granules from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla ( Meyer & Burger , 1979 ) . As the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways are similar in that both undergo 113 gradual acidification during trafficking , it could be possible that a late association of actin in both pathways is essential for neutralization prior to exocytosis . It is not yet clear why lysosomes require neutralization . Further study of these actin - coats would benefit from the generation of temperature sensitive WASH mutants . This would allow post - lysosomes to form followed by immediate WASH disruption , to investigate its role in vesicle fusion and neutralization that is currently hindered by the lack of post - lysosomes . It is fortunate that disruption of WASH in Dictyostelium produced viable cells with no obvious defects in growth , yet yields clear unambiguous phenotypes . This provides an ideal system for further investigating the regulatory mechanisms of WASH and elucidating the mechanistic details of its actions . This work makes a start by showing that in vivo the acidic region is essential for arp2 / 3 mediated actin nucleation , whereas the widely conserved tryptophan in the acidic domain is not . 114 Chapter 5 WASH drives the neutralisation of lysosomes by the removal of the Vacuolar H + ATPase . 115 The vacuolar H + ATPase ( V - ATPase ) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that functions to acidify the lumen of intracellular organelles in eukaryotic cells . Several publications have documented relationships between the V - ATPase and the actin cytoskeleton , namely observations that subunits B and C bind filamentous actin ( Vitavska et al . , 2003 ; Chen et al . , 2004 ) , and perturbing proteins that modulate the actin cytoskeleton have been noted to affect V - ATPase localisation ( Beaulieu et al . , 2005 ) . Here we investigate the role of WASH in lysosome neutralisation as a potential regulator of V - ATPase trafficking . 5 . 1 Lysosome neutralisation is caused by V - ATPase removal Because vesicular compartments are proton ‘leaky’ and the cytosol of cells is pH neutral , vesicle neutralisation can be a passive process requiring only the inhibition of acidification . This is demonstrated by the common use of V - ATPase inhibitors to force neutralisation of endocytic compartments . Therefore to further understand the process of lysosome neutralisation in Dictyostelium we monitored the sub - cellular localisation of V - ATPase during this event . The V - ATPase is composed of two sub - complexes , V 1 and V 0 , each containing multiple subunits . We tagged the B subunit of V 1 ( vatB ) at its C terminus with mRFP as a probe to 116 monitor V - ATPase localisation by fluorescence microscopy . The fusion protein localised to a wide range of vesicular compartments , including the contractile vacuole , consistent with the previous reports of V - ATPase distribution ( Clarke et al . , 2002 ) . To aid the practicalities of tracking a single vesicle during its transit through the endocytic pathway cells were incubated with agarose microsize beads . Once engulfed the bead ensures the vesicle maintains a constant size and shape making it easily identifiable between time - lapse images , and in the case of large beads helping to keep it in the plane of focus . We discovered that by allowing molten agarose to set in a hydrophobic liquid whilst being continually agitated , microscopic agarose beads could be created within the lab . Being able to custom make beads allowed insertion of any desirable substance into the molten agarose before it set , such as Oregon Green conjugated dextran . Similar to FITC , Oregon green is a pH sensitive fluorophore that becomes less fluorescent with decreasing pH . As the bead prevents the cellular compartment from reducing in size the local concentration of fluorescent dextran remains fixed , therefore any change in fluorescent signal can be attributed to a change in luminal pH . Cells expressing vatB - mRFP were incubated with Oregon Green agarose beads to observe the localisation of V - ATPase during lysosome neutralisation . Figure 5 . 1 shows selected images from a time - lapse movie ( supp . Movie 5 ) of cells having engulfed Oregon Green beads , and a graph showing the fluorescent intensity of a bead ( arrow ) during the course of the movie . It was repeatedly observed that removal of vatB from the membrane of phagosomes resulted in a constant elevated pH . This shows that late in the endocytic pathway lysosome neutralisation is caused by the removal of the V - ATPase proton pump . Interestingly , some phagocytosed beads showed oscillating pH changes that were not observed previously during fluid phase trafficking of FITC - dextran . It is possible that phagosomes and macropinosomes have 117 0 min 5 min 13 min 14 min 23 . 5 min 41 min 45 min 60 min 75 . 5 min 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Time ( minutes ) 25000 20000 15000 10000 5000 0 F l uo r e s ce n ce ( A .

However , with vatB present on the compartment , transient neutralisation is followed by acidification , suggesting sustained post - lysosomal neutralisation requires V - ATPase removal . 5 . 2 WASH recruitment coincides with V - ATPase removal WASH was previously shown to be required for lysosome neutralisation . Having shown that this process requires the removal of V - ATPase , the correlation between WASH recruitment and V - ATPase removal was assessed quantitatively . GFP - WASH and vatB - mRFP were co - expressed in wshA null cells fed non - labelled agarose beads . It was noticed from observing numerous cells down the microscope that GFP - WASH and vatB - mRFP were mutually exclusive on internal organelles . Vesicles contained either a coat of GFP - WASH or vatB - mRFP , but never both . Vesicles progressed from a coat of vatB replaced by a WASH coat , consistent with acidification of early and WASH dependent neutralisation of late endocytic compartments . Confocal microscopy was used to quantify the levels of GFP - WASH and vatB - mRFP on phagosomes during their transit through the endocytic pathway . Figure 5 . 2 : A shows selected images from a representative neutralisation event captured by time - lapse microscopy ( supp . Movie 6 ) . Doughnut shaped regions of interest were drawn around the periphery of the tracked phagosome in every frame and the average intensity was measured in each channel . Figure 5 . 2 : B shows a graph of the normalised values obtained after background subtraction . It was found that GFP - WASH 120 recruitment coincides with the removal of vatB - mRFP . This data taken with previous findings that V - ATPase removal drives neutralisation , and neutralisation is dependent upon WASH , suggests that WASH recruitment has an active role in V - ATPase removal . Studies in yeast have shown the V - ATPase is inactivated by the dissociation of its V 1 and V 0 sub - complexes ( Kane , 1995 ) . As vatB is a component of the cytosolic V 1 sub - complex another subunit was cloned from the trans - membrane V 0 complex ( vatM ) to observe if WASH recruitment causes neutralisation by dissociation of V 1 and V 0 . A co - expression experiment showed that mRFP - vatM was removed from the vesicle upon recruitment of GFP - WASH in a similar manner as previously observed with vatB ( Figure 5 . 3 ) ( supp . movie 7 ) . This suggests the V - ATPase is trafficked as a complete unit . As lysosome neutralisation is not a result of V - ATPase dissociation , and the V 0 subcomplex is trans - membrane , we imaged WASH - dependent V - ATPase removal for signs of budding . mRFP - vatB and GFP - WASH were imaged using widefield microscopy for improved time resolution . Using the highest attainable magnification and resolution at our disposal ( 100x objective + 1 . 6x optivar , NA1 . 49 ) images of WASH - dependent V - ATPase removal were captured . Figure 5 . 4 shows stills taken from a successfully captured neutralisation event ( sup . Movie 8 ) . It shows that prior to WASH recruitment the V - ATPase coat is smooth and static . After WASH begins to accumulate on the compartment the V - ATPase coat becomes more dynamic , and what appears to be budding vesicles can be seen forming and detaching from the phagosome ( arrows ) . Most areas of activity also possess WASH puncta . However , it is not 121 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time ( minutes ) min 1 t = 0 5 μ m t = 19min t = 23min t = 25min t = 46min 20 40 60 80 100 VatB - mRFP GFP - WASH A B Figure 5 . 2 : Vesicular localisation of GFP - WASH and vatB - mRFP Cells expressing GFP - WASH and vatB - mRFP were fed agarose beads and imaged under a layer of agarose using confocal microscopy .

Previous reports show that the V - ATPase interacts directly with actin filaments . To date , both subunit B ( Holliday et al . , 2000 ) and C ( Vitavska et al . , 2005 ) of V 1 have been shown to directly bind with filamentous actin . As the B subunit is present in three copies per V - ATPase complex , whereas the C subunit is found only once , this subunit accounts for the majority of the known actin binding sites . This actin binding site has been mapped to a stretch of 11 amino acids near its N terminus ( Chen et al . , 2004 ) and a study in yeast has shown that this site can be altered and still yield a functional V - ATPase ( Zuo et al . , 2008 ) . Figure 5 . 5 shows a sequence alignment of B subunit homologues from various species , highlighting the actin binding site . Recently a structural in silico screen identified enoxacin as a compound that disrupts the interaction between F - actin and subunit B ( Ostrov et al . , 2009 ) . To test if the interaction between actin and subunit B is involved in the WASH - dependent removal of V - ATPase from lysosomes , wild type Ax2 cells were incubated with enoxacin for 24 hour before and during assays for post - lysosome visualisation . Various concentrations were tested but even at the maximum attainable concentration of 100 µ M cells were still able to form post - lysosomes ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . This suggests that the interaction between subunit B and actin does 125 DictyosteliumHuman B1 Human B2 Mouse B1 Mouse B2 ArabidopsisA . acetabulum B2 A . acetabulum B1 S . cerevisiae P . horikoshii DictyosteliumHuman B1 Human B2 Mouse B1 Mouse B2 ArabidopsisA . acetabulum B2 A . acetabulum B1 S . cerevisiae P . horikoshii DictyosteliumHuman B1 Human B2 Mouse B1 Mouse B2 ArabidopsisA . acetabulum B2 A . acetabulum B1 S . cerevisiae P . horikoshii DictyosteliumHuman B1 Human B2 Mouse B1 Mouse B2 ArabidopsisA . acetabulum B2 A . acetabulum B1 S . cerevisiae P . horikoshii DictyosteliumHuman B1 Human B2 Mouse B1 Mouse B2 ArabidopsisA . acetabulum B2 A . acetabulum B1 S . cerevisiae P . horikoshii DictyosteliumHuman B1 Human B2 Mouse B1 Mouse B2 ArabidopsisA . acetabulum B2 A . acetabulum B1 S . cerevisiae P . horikoshii DictyosteliumHuman B1 Human B2 Mouse B1 Mouse B2 ArabidopsisA . acetabulum B2 A . acetabulum B1 S . cerevisiae P . horikoshii DictyosteliumHuman B1 Human B2 Mouse B1 Mouse B2 ArabidopsisA . acetabulum B2 A . acetabulum B1 S . cerevisiae P . horikoshii Figure 5 . 5 : Alignment of V ATPase B subunit homologues Multiple sequence alignment of B subunit homologues of the V ATPase .

As the B subunit is present in 3 copies per V - ATPase molecule simply expressing an altered exogenous copy would be inadequate , as endogenous subunits may incorporate into the same molecule retaining some actin binding domains . Therefore we took an approach to alter the endogenous coding sequence . Two different cell lines were created . One based on Chen et al . ( 2004 ) replacing the endogenous VILDNIRGPKF with GSVEGGKG ( MC7 ) . The other based on Zuo et al . ( 2008 ) replacing the endogenous LDNIR with VAGGA ( MC9 ) . Figure 5 . 7 : A depicts how the endogenous sequence was augmented . DNA constructs were made to introduce a Blasticidin resistance cassette immediately after a gene upstream of vatB ( DDB0304668 ) by homologous recombination . The downstream recombination arm included the sequence for vatB and its endogenous promotor . Recombination constructs pMJC87 and pMJC88 each contained different alterations to this actin binding site based on Chen et al ( 2004 ) and Zuo et al ( 2008 ) respectively . During insertion of the Blasticidin resistance cassette upstream of vatB providing homologous recombination happens downstream of this altered site it will be introduced into the genome . Wild type Ax2 cells were electroporated with either pMJC87 or pMJC88 . After 24 hours transfected cells were plated into 5 x 96 well 128 plates in HL - 5 medium containing Blasticidin . Transformants were screened for integration of the Blasticidin resistance cassette into the desired locus by PCR . Successful transformants could be identified by using a PCR primer to a site not present in the recombination construct to PCR the desired locus . An increase in the PCR product indicates the successful insertion of the BSR cassette upstream of vatB . Cell lines MC7 and MC9 were identified ( Figure 5 . 7 : B + C ) from transformants electroporated with pMJC87 and pMJC88 respectively . The vatB gene was then amplified by PCR using a C terminal primer not present in the recombination construct and this product was sequenced to confirm alteration of endogenous vatB . 5 . 6 Actin binding site on subunit B is not essential for lysosomes neutralisation . Cell lines where the actin binding site on subunit B of the V - ATPase had been disrupted were assessed for their ability to form neutralised post - lysosomes . Figure 5 . 8 shows cells incubated in FITC and TRITC dextran for 1 hour and visualised by confocal microscopy . It shows that the actin binding site of subunit B is not essential for lysosome neutralisation as post lysosomes are clearly visible ( arrows ) . However , the remaining actin binding site on subunit C may be enough to still yield a significant interaction . Given time the ability of the V - ATPase in these cells to bind to F - actin should be assessed in vitro . In addition , whilst trying to identify the site responsible for actin binding Chen et al . , ( 2004 ) made two assertions that appear to be incorrect . Firstly the 129 Genomic DNA pMJC87 / 88 Figure 5 . 7 : Generation of non - actin binding vatB cell lines ( A ) Schematic representation of method to disrupt endogenous vatB actin binding sites .

Both cell lines were later sequenced confirming alterations to actin binding sites . 131 Parent wshA null MC9 vatB mutant MC7 Figure 5 . 8 : Visualisation of post - lysosomes in non - actin binding vatB cell lines . Post - lysosome visualisation assay where cells are loaded with FITC and TRITC dextran for 1 hour and imaged by confocal micrsocopy . Post lysosomes appear as bright yellow or green compartments ( arrows ) due to their neutral lumen . MC7 and MC9 cell lines both contained large neutralised post - lysosomes . Error bars show 10 μ m . 132 proposed actin binding site was identified due to homology with profilin . Figure 5 . 9 shows the crystal structure of human profilin I ( blue ) bound to Dictyostelium actin ( green ) . The residues suggested to be homologous between profilin and subunit B of the V - ATPase has been coloured red . None of these residues are involved with direct binding to actin . Chen et al ( 2004 ) also argued that replacement of this proposed actin binding site on the human B subunit with the equivalent sequence from of P . horikoshii , an archea that lacks an actin cytoskeleton and therefore should not possess the actin binding site , was sufficient to abolish actin binding . Figure 5 . 5 shows a sequence alignment of B subunits in which we have included P . horikoshii . We find that with the exception of a single methionine the sequence of P . horikoshii is functionally similar to B subunits from a range of eukaryotes . Also , when constructing peptides for binding experiments , they replaced the methionine with glycine for cloning purposes , making their P . horikoshii more functionally similar to the valine present in eukaryotes . Had these replacements worked in Dictyostelium this would have been strong evidence for an interaction for actin and the V - ATPase , however with the apparent discrepancies this data only provides weak negative data due to concerns over the validity of this being a true actin binding site . 133 Figure 5 . 9 : Binding of human profilin I to Dictyostelium actin . Crystal structure of profilin I bound to actin , published by Baek et al . , ( 2008 ) . The structure was downloaded from the RCSB protein database ( www . pdb . org ) and viewed using Swiss - pdbviewer v4 . Actin was coloured green and profilin I blue , with the region proposed to resemble homology with subunit B of the V ATPase highlight in red . This shows that the region does not contain any residues directly involved in the binding of profilin I with actin . 134 5 . 7 Conclusions This work shows that lysosome neutralisation in Dictyostelium is caused by the removal of V - ATPase from the lysosomal membrane , likely through selective budding . As of yet nothing is known as to why mature lysosomes require neutralising prior to exocytosis , although it may be to maintain a vesicular localisation of the V - ATPase preventing it from entering the plasma membrane during vesicle fusion . Clarke et al . , ( 2010 ) has also noted what appears to be removal of vatM through budding whilst studying the process of premature exocytosis in Dictyostelium . Given that actin is implicated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis it is natural to presume that WASH is facilitating a similar role on internal organelles . However , if the actin cytoskeleton is an essential requirement for vesicle budding then it would be expected to be ubiquitously distributed on almost all intracellular vesicles . As this is not the case it would appear that the role of WASH - dependent actin has a more specialised function . The high avidity of the V - ATPase for actin filaments suggests a possible explanation . When two molecules have a high affinity it would generally be expected that they show a reasonable level of colocalisation . Interestingly , actin and V - ATPase are almost entirely mutually exclusive throughout the endocytic pathway . V - ATPase starts to accumulate on macropinosomes just after the residual actin coat has been disassembled ( Rauchenberger et al . , 1997 ; Clarke et al . , 2002 ) , and its removal is dependent on , and occurs simultaneously with the generation of WASH - dependent actin . Taken together this suggests that it may be the interaction between V - ATPase and actin 135 that aids its removal . To test this hypothesis it is necessary to disrupt these interactions and observe the effect on V - ATPase trafficking . A start has been made by genetically disrupting a region in the B subunit previously published to be a site of F - actin binding . This disruption did not prevent neutralisation , however , this study is still incomplete . It remains necessary to further disrupt the actin binding site within the C subunit and assess if this V - ATPase complex is still functional , and incapable of binding actin . 136 Chapter 6 Final conclusions and future perspectives 137 6 . 1 The role of WASH in Dictyostelium discoideum The actin cytoskeleton is a collection of filamentous structures involved in generating protrusive and contractive forces , rigid scaffolds and manipulation of cellular membranes . It has long been known to be essential for a variety of processes requiring changes in cell morphology , such as cell motility , cytokinesis and endocytosis . Recently it has become clear that the actin cytoskeleton serves broader functions within the cell . These include vesicle propulsion and aiding fission of budding vesicles . This work identifies a new role for actin in the endocytic pathway in controlling vesicle identity and maturation . Genetically disrupting WASH in Dictyostelium has allowed us to identify it as the NPF responsible for the formation of actin - coats around late endocytic compartments . These actin - coats were shown to be essential for the formation of neutralised post - lysosomes , and that disruption of this process resulted in an inability to exocytose material from the endocytic pathway . This presumably is a disruption in a vesicle maturation pathway were by V - ATPase must be removed prior to exocytosis preventing the proton pump from entering the plasma membrane . During live cell imaging of fluorescent fusion proteins it was noticed that WASH first appeared in punctate patches , and a large proportion of the V - ATPase was removed before it had attained a full coat of WASH . Observing that the transmembrane domain of the V - ATPase was removed simultaneously with WASH recruitment suggested that this process was driven by budding , and this was also observed during high speed acquisition with widefield microscopy . 138 Due to the essential role of actin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in yeast ( Ayscough et al 1997 ) it is natural to presume that WASH - dependent actin is performing a similar role in scission of budding vesicles on endosomal compartments ; as proposed by Derivery et al . , ( 2009 ) . However , here we propose an alternative mechanism . The role of actin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis has recently been shown to facilitate the invagination of the plasma - membrane against turgor pressure in yeast ( Aghamohammadzadeh & Ayscough , 2009 ) . By decreasing turgor pressure clathrin - mediated endocytosis became less dependent upon actin , showing that actin is not essential for budding or scission but merely serves to provide force for difficult to deform membranes . Budding of intracellular vesicles is more favourable due to the lack of turgor pressure and an already positive membrane curvature . It is also a common event on almost all compartments of the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways , and given actin is not equally ubiquitous on all these it suggests it too is not essential for budding on internal compartments . We suggest that the defects observed in Dictyostelium and mammalian cells are not due to the inability to bud vesicles and that WASH - dependent actin has a specific and antagonistic role in regulating the localisation of V - ATPase , providing a facilitative role in targeting it to sites of budding . This is based on the observation that although V - ATPase has a high avidity for filamentous actin ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Vitavska et al . , 2005 ; Zuo et al . , 2008 ) , its location is mutually exclusive with actin throughout the endocytic pathway in Dictyostelium . V - ATPase is only incorporated into newly formed macropinosomes after disassembly of a residual actin coat ( Rauchenberger et al . , 1997 ; Clarke et al . , 2002 ) and is then removed at a later stage in a WASH and actin dependent manner . There have also been several reports that disruption of the actin 139 cytoskeleton can result in altered localisation of the V - ATPase ( Beauileu et al . , 2005 ; Shum et al . , 2010 ) Figure 6 . 1 depicts our proposed model . WASH arrives in punctate patches on acidic vesicles generating localised patches of actin assembly . V - ATPase molecules that are freely diffusible within the membrane are sequestered in these patches due to their avidity for actin . These regions may then be targeted as sites of budding that may or may not be facilitated by force generated by actin polymerisation , allowing selective and efficient removal of V - ATPase from the membrane . The actin - coat may then persist as a barrier for exocytosis as previously proposed ( Drengk et al . , 2003 ) or serve to prevent re - acidification . This vesicle can then be exocytosed without causing V - ATPase incorporation into the plasma - membrane . 6 . 2 WASH in Dictyostelium and Mammalian cells Here we report a different localisation of WASH in Dictyostelium to that previously published in mammalian cells . By colocalisation with a range of endocytic markers Derivery et al . , ( 2009 ) showed WASH to be present on a range of endocytic compartments . It was shown to be more abundant on early sorting and recycling endosomes and less so on late endosomes and lysosomes . This is in contrast to the recruitment of WASH to late endocytic compartments in Dictyostelium . 140 Lysosome Post - Lysosome ~ 5 minutes ~ 25 minutes ~ 2 minutes Acidic Acidic Acidic Acidic Neutral Neutral Exocytosis V - ATPase Actin WASH b a e d c Key : Figure 6 . 1 : Model of WASH - mediated lysosome neutralization ( a ) WASH appears on acidic vesicles in discrete puncta . . ( b ) WASH patches generate actin patches that sequester freely diffusible V - ATPase . ( C ) These V - ATPase dense regions may then be targeted as sites of budding by currently unknown mechanisms to efficiently remove V - ATPase from the vesicle causing it to neutralise . ( d ) Actin coat remains potentially to prevent fussion with other compartments of the plasma membrane . ( e ) WASH is removed prior to exocytosis and the compartment fuses with the plasma membrane . 141 Depletion of WASH by RNAi revealed defects in trafficking of the transferrin receptor , the retromer - dependent transport of CI - MPR back to the golgi , and EGF transport to late endosomes ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez & Billadeau , 2009 ; Duleh & Welch , 2010 ) . An increase in tubulation of these compartments was also observed ( Duleh & Welch , 2010 ) as was a punctate localisation of WASH ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez & Billadeau , 2009 ) . It was proposed that WASH is required for nucleating actin on these compartments driving scission of vesicles , and its disruption therefore results in tubulated structures and trafficking defects due the inability to generate transport vesicles . It is interesting that WASH becomes less abundant on compartments along the endocytic pathway in mammalian cells , which is also accompanied by increasing acidity . Figure 6 . 2 depicts the localisation of WASH on the endocytic pathway in mammalian cells showing the luminal pH of each compartment . Given the data obtained from this work we suggest an alternative interpretation of the mammalian data set . WASH could be regulating the density of V - ATPase on endocytic compartments by driving V - ATPase removal . The punctate nature of WASH on these compartments would allow V - ATPase to be inserted in actin clear regions and selectively removed at WASH patches . As WASH becomes less prominent on late endocytic vesicles a higher V - ATPase density can be achieved by a reduction in its removal , and result in a lower luminal pH . In this case depleting WASH would be expected to disrupt the gradual pH drops between compartments necessary for receptor trafficking consistent with the trafficking defects observed . Regarding vesicle morphology it has been shown that treatment of cells with the V - ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin resulted in tubulation of endocytic vesicles ( D’Arrigo et al . , 1997 ) . Although this drug causes neutralisation of 142 Figure 6 . 2 : Distribution of WASH on the endocytic pathway in mammalian cells Illustration taken from Derivery et al . , ( 2009 ) showing the distribution of WASH on compartments based on colocalisation with the illustrated markers . Image was modified to show luminal pH to illustrate that correlation between decreasing WASH and increasing acidity . pH 6 pH 6 . 5 pH < 6 pH < 5 143 compartments , rather than the increased acidity we are proposing , it demonstrates that maintaining the correct luminal pH is important for endosome morphology . This hypothesis is further supported by work on transferrin receptor recycling . After internalisation the transferrin receptor passes briefly through an acidic compartment before entering a more neutral structure . Purification of this compartment revealed the lack of V - ATPase ( Gagescu et al . , 2000 ) , showing that luminal pH can be regulated by adjusting the amount of V - ATPase within the membrane . 6 . 3 Future perspectives As WASH was only recently discovered little is known regarding its regulation or function . What is known about its regulation is inferred from similarities with another member of the WASP protein family , SCAR ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) , and regarding its function little is known beyond it having a role in the endocytic pathway . This work presents an advance in the understanding of WASH function , and opens up future possibilities for understanding its regulation . Dictyostelium may prove to be an ideal model organism for the further study of WASH . In addition to its generic advantages of being genetically tractable and easily handled , the 144 differences between the endocytic pathway in Dictyostelium and mammals may prove advantageous . Interpretation of disruption studies in mammalian cells could be complicated by secondary effects from disrupting early trafficking events , such as growth , receptor recycling and signalling pathways . The role of WASH late in the endocytic pathway in Dictyostelium has allowed its disruption with little effect on cell viability in laboratory culture medium . It is fortunate that disruption of WASH yielded viable cells and at the same times such clear and currently unique phenotypes . All subunits of the WASH complex identified by Derivery et al ( 2009 ) have been identified in Dictyostelium ( Veltman et al . , 2010 ) , suggesting conservation of its regulation . By screening REMI generated mutant libraries for cells with normal growth yet defects in exocytosis , further key players in WASH regulation can be identified . This work could impact on several other previously unconnected areas of research . A great deal of work on the interaction of V - ATPase with the actin cytoskeleton has been focused in specialised cells that accumulate V - ATPase at the plasma membrane , such as osteoclasts and epididymal clear cells ( Zuo et al . , 2006 ; Shum et al . , 2010 ) . As this work suggests the interaction may be essential in preventing its accumulation at the plasma membrane rather than targeting it there , this work provides a fresh perspective . 145 Additionally , the biosynthetic secretory pathway is also accompanied by gradual drops in luminal pH between compartments . This results in secretory vesicles being acidic and densely covered in V - ATPase . It has previously been documented that secretory granules from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are surrounded by a dense web of actin filaments ( Meyer & Burger , 1979 ) . In light of new data this suggests that a similar actin - dependent mechanism for V - ATPase removal may be functioning in the secretory pathway , and by a similar mechanism observed in Dictyostelium these coats may be required for exocytosis rather than acting as an inhibitor . In summary , WASH in Dictyostelium is required for successful transit of material through the endocytic pathway by facilitating the removal of V - ATPase from lysosomes . This provides new insights into the role of WASH in mammalian cells and may provide a newly identified mechanism by which the pH of the endosomal lumen may be regulated . 146 147 References Aguado - Velasco , C . and Bretscher , M .
