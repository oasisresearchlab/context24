SMIFH2 has effects on Formins and p53 that perturb the cell cytoskeleton Tadamoto Isogai , Rob van der Kammen & Metello Innocenti Division of Molecular Genetics , The Netherlands Cancer Institute , Amsterdam , The Netherlands . Formin proteins are key regulators of the cytoskeleton involved in developmental and homeostatic programs , and human disease . For these reasons , small molecules interfering with Formins’ activity have gained increasing attention . Among them , small molecule inhibitor of Formin Homology 2 domains ( SMIFH2 ) is often used as a pharmacological Formin blocker . Although SMIFH2 inhibits actin polymerization by Formins and affects the actin cytoskeleton , its cellular mechanism of action and target specificity remain unclear . Here we show that SMIFH2 induces remodelling of actin filaments , microtubules and the Golgi complex as a result of its effects on Formins and p53 . We found that SMIFH2 triggers alternated depolymerization - repolymerization cycles of actin and tubulin , increases cell migration , causes scattering of the Golgi complex , and also cytotoxicity at high dose . Moreover , SMIFH2 reduces expression and activity of p53 through a post - transcriptional , proteasome - independent mechanism that influences remodelling of the cytoskeleton . As the action of SMIFH2 may go beyond Formin inhibition , only short - term and low - dose SMIFH2 treatments minimize confounding effects induced by loss of p53 and cytotoxicity . A ctin and microtubule networks are actively remodelled in response to external and internal signals to facilitate proper execution of a large number of cellular processes , such as formation of membrane protrusions and invaginations for cell movement and endocytosis , segregation of chromosomes during mitosis , abscission of daughter cells during cytokinesis , establishment of cell polarity , vesicle and organelle movement 1 , 2 . Not surprisingly , genetic studies indicate that actin and tubulin are instrumental for development and tissue homeostasis in mice 3 - 11 and compelling evidence links them to human pathologies 12 - 14 . Actin and tubulin exist as monomers that can reversibly form polymeric structures referred to as Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) and microtubule , respectively . Transition between these alternative states is controlled by numer - ous actin - and microtubule - binding proteins . Among these , tumour associated protein p53 and Formin - family of proteins ( Formins ) can modulate both actin and microtubule networks . p53 is a transcription factor commonly deleted or mutated in several types of cancer 15 , 16 that , besides control - ling apoptosis and cell - cycle arrest in response to a variety of physiological and noxious signals 15 , also affects cell migration and invasion . Wild - type p53 modulates the activity of Rho - GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton to suppress directed cell migration and invasion 17 - 22 . Moreover , some p53 mutants possess transcription - independ - ent pro - invasive functions 16 , 23 , 24 . As actin and microtubule dynamics control p53 activity 25 - 27 , regulation of p53 and cytoskeleton are interlaced with each other . Formins are an evolutionary conserved protein family that binds monomeric actin and polymerizes it into filamentous actin through their Formin Homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain . Recent studies have indicated that several Formins ( mDia1 , mDia2 , mDia3 , INF1 , FMN1 , FMN2 and Cappuccino ) are also able to bind microtubules and increase their stability 28 - 35 . Vice versa , actin and tubulin can modulate Formins’ properties 29 . These observations suggest that Formin regulation , microtubule and actin dynamics are mutually interlinked . Consistently , Formins dictate proper execution of several cellular processes relying on the cytoskeleton 36 . Finally , increasing evidence links Formins to cancer and other diseases , suggesting that they may be potential new candidates for targeted therapy 37 , 38 . Small molecule inhibitor of Formin Homology 2 domains ( SMIFH2 ) is a cell - permeable compound that inhibits Formin - dependent actin polymerization by targeting the FH2 domain 39 . This property qualifies SMIFH2 as a general Formin inhibitor that may block the activity of all 15 Formin - family proteins . SMIFH2 has been used in many laboratories to explore Formins’ function in a wide range of biological contexts and OPEN SUBJECT AREAS : ACTIN CYTOSKELETON Received 10 October 2014 Accepted 19 March 2015 Published Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to M .

Yet , observed effects , applied concentrations and treat - ment duration are quite variable and highlight lack of a thorough characterization of SMIFH2 40 - 65 . In this study we find that SMIFH2 causes alternated depolymer - ization - repolymerization cycles of actin and microtubules , as well as scattering of the Golgi complex , whose onset correlates with post - transcriptional downregulation of Formin mDia2 and p53 . While SMIFH2 attenuates p53 - transcriptional activity independently of mDia2 , it may induce cytoskeletal remodelling as a result of both Formin and p53 inhibition . As we also report that SMIFH2 triggers cytotoxicity at high doses , we recommend current and future SMIFH2 users to employ short incubation ( , 1 hour ) and moderate concentrations ( , 25 m M ) to minimize confounding effects induced by loss of p53 and cytotoxi - city . Under this provision , SMIFH2 represents a useful tool to study Formins both at the cellular and organismal levels . Results Single dose of SMIFH2 induces alternated depolymerization - repolymerization cycles of actin and tubulin . SMIFH2 is frequently exploited as pharmacological Formin inhibitor in loss - of - function studies . Consistent with Formins being key actin - regulatory proteins , many reports showed that SMIFH2 perturbs the actin cytoskeleton and gives rise to a constellation of actin - dependent phenotypes ( Table 1 ) . However , the broad range of employed concentrations and incubation times prevent comparative analyses and raises concerns about target specificity of SMIFH2 ( Table 1 ) . Despite Formins’ ability to regulate also microtubule dynamics , no information is available as to whether and how SMIFH2 affects microtubules . Together , these considerations show that a thorough and systematic characterization of SMIFH2 is missing . We treated U2OS and HCT116 cells with SMIFH2 and monitored the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules over time Table 1 | List of studies using SMIFH2 ( as of September , 2014 ) .

In order to compare different time points of treatment , we stained cells in parallel and used identical settings for image acquisition . Control U2OS and HCT116 cells showed well - organized actin and microtubule networks ( Fig . 1A and 2A ) . Cells incubated for one hour with SMIFH2 displayed reduced phalloidin signal accompanied by an increase in that of tubulin ( Fig . 1A and 2A ) . As actin and tubulin protein levels did not vary in either U2OS or HCT116 cells ( Fig . 1B and 2B ) , there appears to be a drop in cellular filamentous actin and a concomitant increase in polymeric tubulin . After two hours of treat - ment , stress fibres and apical filopodia - like protrusions formed in U2OS and HCT116 cells , respectively ( Fig . 1A and 2A ) . Notably , the actin cytoskeleton of U2OS cells consisted primarily of lamellipodia and shaped into filopodia - like protrusions after four and eight hours of treatment with SMIFH2 , respectively ( Fig . 1A ) . Although HCT116 cells did not show lamellipodia at four hours , they formed basal filopodia - like protrusions after eight hours of treatment with SMIFH2 ( Fig . 2A ) . Two hours after addition of SMIFH2 , microtubules were barely detectable in both U2OS and HCT116 cells ( Fig . 1A and 2A , respectively ) . Lack of microtubules persisted up to the eight - hour time point in U2OS cells ( Fig . 1A ) . Conversely , HCT116 cells showed some microtubules resistant to SMIFH2 - induced depoly - merization and also underwent a full repolymerization - depoly - merization cycle between four and eight hours ( Fig . 2A ) . Both U2OS and HCT116 cells reacquired a morphologically normal cytoskeleton when exposed to SMIFH2 for more than sixteen hours ( Fig . 1A , 2A and not shown ) . The finding that SMIFH2 induces alternated depolymerization - repolymerization cycles of actin and microtubules was confirmed by live - cell imaging ( Supplementary Movie S1 ) and has three possible explanations : i ) SMIFH2 undergoes intracellular breakdown and / or inactivation , which progressively lowers SMIFH2’s active concentration below that required for full inhibition of all Formins , or ii ) SMIFH2 has different and Formin - specific inhibitory effects on the actin and microtubule - regulatory activities , or iii ) it has additional unknown targets . To gain insight into this issue , we treated U2OS cells with SMIFH2 and , every two hours , replaced the medium containing the inhibitor . Under this regimen , SMIFH2 addition caused a progressive and persistent depolymerization of both the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules ( Supplementary Fig . S1A ) . As the SMIFH2 - containing medium was prepared at the beginning of the time course , these results suggest that the depolymerization - repolymerization cycles of actin and microtubules are due to intracellular SMIFH2 breakdown / inactivation rather than its instability . SMIFH2 increases cell migration and prevents mitosis . The formation of SMIFH2 - induced lamellipodia in U2OS cells prompted us to analyse cell migration . We manually tracked individual DMSO - or SMIFH2 - treated U2OS cells and calculated total displacement , directionality and migration speed . SMIFH2 - treated cells showed enhanced motility compared to DMSO - treated control cells , whereas speed and directionality did not significantly change ( Fig . 3A - C , and Supplementary Movie S2 ) . Interestingly , migration speed and displacement of SMIFH2 - treated U2OS cells increased between three and five hours ( Fig . 3D - E ) , temporally correlating with lamellipodium formation . As directionality was not concomitantly affected ( data not shown ) , these data suggest that SMIFH2 affects cell motility by transiently modulating actin - based protrusions . In - depth analysis of these time - lapse experiments evidenced that while the DMSO - treated cell population underwent mitosis , this was instead a rare event in the cells exposed to SMIFH2 ( Fig . 3F and Supplementary Movie S2 ) . These results suggest that SMIFH2 delays ( or abrogates ) cell division and are consistent with Formins being implicated in cytokinesis . SMIFH2 perturbs the architecture of the Golgi complex . The integrity of the Golgi apparatus strictly depends on microtubule 66 and actin dynamics , 67 INF2 and mDia1 Formins 68 , 69 . Thus , we stained the Golgi complex in control and SMIFH2 - treated cells using Giantin , a bona fide marker for this organelle . The Golgi complex underwent a dramatic remodelling induced by SMIFH2 in both U2OS and HCT116 cells , as illustrated in Figure 1A and 2A , respectively . After one hour of treatment , the intensity of Giantin staining started to decrease and the Golgi showed a scattered morphology . At four hours , most of the Giantin signal disappeared , whereas protein levels remained stable ( Fig . 1B and 2B ) . Longer treatment with SMIFH2 resulted in gradual recovery of the normal Golgi structure , which was restored at sixteen hours ( Fig . 1A and 2A ) . We confirmed that SMIFH2 causes scattering of the Golgi complex using the cis - Golgi marker GM130 and the trans - Golgi marker TGN46 ( Supplementary Fig . S2A ) . As U2OS and HCT116 cells express different Formins ( Supplementary Fig S3A - B ) , this effect seems to support that SMIFH2 is a general Formin inhibitor 39 . Strikingly , SMIFH2 failed to cause disappearance of Giantin and only resulted in a moderate scattering of the Golgi complex in mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . Moreover , MEFs also started to die at 8 hours post addition of 25 m M SMIFH2 ( Supplementary Fig . S4A ) . These discrepancies may be due to either inter - species differences ( H . sapiens vs . M . musculus ) or the nature of the analysed cells ( cancer cells vs . immortalized cells ) . Nevertheless , MEFs showed alternated depolymerization - repolymerization of both actin and tubulin ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . SMIFH2 reduces p300 , mDia2 and p53 levels in a proteasome - independent manner . Pilot dose - response experiments unmasked dramatic cytotoxic effects and cell death at SMIFH2 concentrations higher than 25 m M ( Supplementary Movie S3 ) , in agreement with previously reported observations 39 . As p53 is a master regulator of cellular apoptotic programs , we selected a few cells lines to cover all fundamental aspects of p53 biology . We employed 293T , A375 , U2OS , MDA - MB - 231 and HCT116 cells to take into account wild - type ( 293T , A375 , U2OS , HCT116 ) versus mutant ( MDA - MB - 231 ) p53 status , high ( 293T , MDA - MB - 231 , HCT116 ) versus low ( A375 , U2OS ) p53 expression and , proficient ( 293T , A375 , U2OS , HCT116 ) versus deficient ( MDA - MB - 231 ) p53 transcriptional activity . Of note , these cell lines also have distinct Formin - expression landscapes ( Supplementary Fig S3A - C and data not shown ) . We treated 293T , A375 , U2OS and MDA - MB - 231 cells with SMIFH2 and assessed the protein levels of p53 and its transcriptional co - activator p300 . Expression of Diaphanous - related Formins mDia1 , mDia2 and mDia3 was monitored as a control . Remarkably , we found that SMIFH2 reduced the protein level of mDia2 , p53 and p300 , while that of mDia1 and mDia3 were not affected ( Fig . 4A - E ) . Notably , mDia1 showed a reproducible SDS - PAGE mobility shift suggesting a post - translational modification ( Fig . 4A - E ) . Downregulation of p53 was clearly independent of p53 status , expression levels , and transcriptional activity and occurred in both immortalized ( 293T ) and cancer ( A375 , U2OS , MDA - MB - 231 and HCT116 ) cells of human origin ( Fig . 4F ) . In agreement with this conclusion , SMIFH2 triggered downregulation of mDia2 and p53 also in MEFs ( Supplementary Fig . S4B ) . Finally , we exploited two different anti - p53 antibodies to verify that SMIFH2 truly decreases p53 levels rather than causing post - translational modifications of p53 that prevent epitope recognition ( Fig . 4G ) . SMIFH2 inhibits Formins at the protein level and proteasome controls degradation of many cytosolic proteins , including p53 and mDia2 70 , 71 . Thus , we reasoned that SMIFH2 may promote protea - some - mediated disposal of mDia2 , p300 and p53 and used the pro - teasome inhibitor Lactacystin to test this hypothesis . Lactacystin did not restore mDia2 , p53 and p300 levels in SMIFH2 - treated 293T , A375 , U2OS and MDA - MB - 231 cells , although it promoted the www . nature . com / scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 5 : 9802 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep09802 3 Tubulin F - actin Giantin Nucleus A B DMSO , 16 hrs SMIFH2 , 1 hr SMIFH2 , 2 hrs SMIFH2 , 4 hrs SMIFH2 , 8 hrs SMIFH2 , 16 hrs p53 50 200 120 50 Tubulin 50 40 actin mDia2 120 Giantin vinculin 150 16 1 2 4 8 16 SMIFH2 ( 25 µM ) DMSO : Time ( h ) Figure 1 | SMIFH2 affects the cytoskeleton and the Golgi complex of U2OS cells .

some ( Fig . 4B - E ) . Higher Lactacystin concentrations , longer treat - ment duration and different proteasome or protease inhibitors ( MG - 132 and ALLN , respectively ) also failed to rescue mDia2 , p53 and p300 levels ( data not shown ) . The sum of these data strongly suggests that SMIFH2 induces proteasome - independent degradation of selective proteins , including p53 , p300 and mDia2 . Next , we tested the possibility that SMIFH2 may alter abundance of messenger RNA of its targets . RT - qPCR on total mRNA isolated from SMIFH2 - treated and DMSO - treated cells ruled out that SMIFH2 perturbs the mRNA levels of mDia2 and p53 ( Supplementary Fig . S5A - B ) . These results support the notion that SMIFH2 acts at post - transcriptional level . Collectively , these data show that downregulation of mDia2 , p53 and p300 is a general and proteasome - independent effect of SMIFH2 . Yet , the involvement of Formins in regulating gene expression post - transcriptionally remains unclear . SMIFH2 attenuates p53 transcriptional activity . p53 is a well - known transcription factor regulating expression of genes related to cell cycle , DNA damage repair and apoptosis 15 . Given that SMIFH2 reduces the expression of p53 and p300 , we assessed the functional consequence of it on p53 transcriptional activity . To this end , we transfected 293T cells with a p53 - responsive , HDM2 promoter - driven luciferase reporter plasmid , treated them with either SMIFH2 or DMSO and then measured the luciferase activity . These experiments revealed that addition of SMIFH2 attenuated p53 - transcriptional activity compared to control samples ( Fig . 5A ) . Although SMIFH2 decreased both p53 and mDia2 expression , three observations suggest that reduced p53 - transcriptional activity is independent of mDia2 : knockdown of mDia2 did not affect i ) either p53 - transcriptional activity or ii ) p53 protein levels ( Fig . 5B - D ) , and iii ) SMIFH2 reduced p53 levels also in HCT116 cells ( Fig . 2B ) , where mDia2 is below detection limit ( Supplementary Fig . S5C ) . Similarly , reduced mDia2 expression is independent of p53 levels as shown by the two following observations : i ) silencing of p53 did not alter mDia2 protein levels ( Fig . 5E - G ) , and ii ) time - course experiments revealed the SMIFH2 - induced dowregulation of mDia2 occurred with similar kinetics in both control and p53 knockdown U2OS cells ( Supplementary Fig . S6A - B ) . SMIFH2 - induced cytoskeletal remodelling and downregulation of p53 temporally overlap . Analysis of total cell extracts matching the time - course of Figures 1 and 2 revealed that p53 and mDia2 levels started to decline in U2OS one and two hour after SMIFH2 addition , respectively ( Fig . 1B ) . In U2OS cells , expression of p53 was dramatically decreased at the eight - hour time point , whereas that of mDia2 was below detection limit already after four hours of treatment . Remarkably , normal p53 levels were fully rescued after sixteen hours , whilst mDia2 downregulation remained complete . Conversely , p53 remained low when SMIFH2 treatment involved replacing the inhibitor every two hours ( Supplementary Fig . S1B ) . This observation corroborates the conclusion that SMIFH2 is broken down or inactivated within cells . In HCT116 cells , SMIFH2 - induced downregulation of p53 became evident only at two hours of treatment and was less dramatic than in all other tested cell lines ( Fig . 2B and Fig . 4A - E ) . Nevertheless , SMIFH2 - induced remodelling of the cytoskeleton and p53 downregulation occurred as temporally correlated events also in HCT116 cells . It is worth noting that effectiveness of SMIFH2 treatment is not related to basal p53 expression as SMIFH2 strongly reduced p53 levels in 293T cells , which have more p53 than HCT116 cells ( Fig . 4A - B and Supplementary Fig . S5C ) . In addition to regulating gene transcription , p53’s action extends to the cytoskeleton 17 - 21 .

A ll r i g h t s r e s e r v e d . www . nature . com / scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 5 : 9802 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep09802 9 transcriptional activity , we wondered whether the effects of SMIFH2 on p53 could explain , at least partially , those on the cytoskeleton . Side - to - side comparison of cytoskeletal remodelling evoked by SMIFH2 in wild - type and p53 - / - HCT116 cells showed that the decrease in phalloidin and concomitant increase in tubulin signals observed at the one - hour time point were linked to p53 expression ( Fig . 2 and Fig . 6 ) . Conversely , the two cell lines responded similarly to SMIFH2 from two hours onwards , namely since reduction of p53 levels in the p53 wild - type cells . Control and p53 knockdown U2OS cells showed that p53 expression levels regulate the actin cytoskele - ton , whereas they do not affect either microtubules or Golgi organ - ization ( Supplementary Fig . S6A ) . Under growing conditions , we observed that the cortical actin cytoskeleton and stress fibres were more prominent in either p53 knockdown mass populations than in the corresponding control knockdown mass population ( Supplementary Fig . S6A ) . Live - cell imaging of control and p53 knockdown U2OS cells expressing EGFP - LifeAct and mCherry - a - Tubulin unveiled that p53 is needed for SMIFH2 to induce the protrusion of lamellipodia ( Supplementary Movie S4 ) . Conversely , these experiments showed that SMIFH2’s effect on microtubule dynamics are independent of p53 , at least in U2OS cells ( Supplementary Movie S5 ) . As SMIFH2 reduces p53 expression and activity and p53 levels affect the cytoskeleton , the observed interplay between p53 and the cytoskeleton makes it difficult to ascribe any cytoskeletal effects induced by SMIFH2 treatments longer than one hour solely to Formin inhibition . In spite of that , SMIFH2’s effects on the Golgi complex did not seem to be modulated by p53 in either HCT116 or U2OS cells ( Fig . 2 and Fig . 6 and Supplementary Movie S6 ) . Discussion In this study we found that the general Formin inhibitor SMIFH2 causes alternated depolymerization - repolymerization cycles of actin and microtubules , as well as scattering of the Golgi complex in human cells ( Fig . 1 and Fig . 2 ) . Surprisingly , SMIFH2 decreased the protein levels of p300 , mDia2 and p53 without affecting the abundance of their messenger RNA . As proteasome inhibitors failed to restore the expression of p300 , mDia2 and p53 , we suggest that SMIFH2 regulates expression of these proteins post - transcriptionally and independently of the proteasome . Although it is formally possible that SMIFH2 might affect protein translation as such , we regard this possibility as unlikely since expression of other proteins ( e . g . mDia1 , mDia3 , actin , tubulin and Giantin ) remained unchanged ( Fig . 4 ) . Consistent with the observed reduction in p53 and p300 levels , SMIFH2 attenuated p53 transcriptional activity independently of mDia2 . The finding that expression of p53 and mDia2 were not interlinked confirms that there is no causal relationship between mDia2 and p53 regulation by SMIFH2 ( Fig . 5 ) . Nonetheless , depolymerization of F - actin can activate p53 tran - scription 25 and polymerization of G - actin inhibits p53 function 26 . Given that Formins are actin nucleators , it is reasonable to speculate that they directly or indirectly impact on the p53 pathway . Interestingly , a recent study implicated Formin FMN2 in stabiliza - tion of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p21 during oncogene / stress - induced cell cycle arrest 72 . Confocal imaging confirmed that SMIFH2 modulates the actin cytoskeleton as previously reported 39 , although observed phenotypes depend on both the cell line being tested and treatment duration ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . We hypothesize that this is most likely due to Formins having cell - type - specific expression profiles ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) and different sensitivity to SMIFH2 . Under the condition that SMIFH2 has Formin - specific affinities and its active concentration drops relatively fast , the alternated depolymerization - repolymerization cycles of actin and microtubules triggered by SMIFH2 would agree with mDia1 , mDia2 , INF2 , and possibly some other Formins , co - regulating the dynamics of F - actin and microtubules and either cytoskeletal network modulating Formins’ action on the other one 29 , 73 . Most importantly , we discovered that SMIFH2 reduces both the expression levels and the transcriptional activity of p53 and that this property contributes to SMIFH2 - induced cytoskeletal remodelling ( Fig . 5 , Fig . 2 , Fig . 6 and Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . The link between p53 and cytoskeletal remodelling is further strengthened by our re - analysis of a recent study identifying a set of 198 genes upregulated one hour after stabilization of p53 in HCT116 cells 74 . Among them , 77 were novel and previously uncharacterized p53 targets 74 . Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis , we found that 43 out of the 192 mapped genes are early p53 target genes significantly associated with func - tions related to cellular movement ( Table 2 ) . In keeping with this notion , we noted that wild - type and p53 - / - HCT116 cells responded differently to SMIFH2 at early ( , 1 hour ) , but not late time points . We established that p53 modulates the cellular responses to SMIFH2 both in HCT116 cells and U2OS cells by using syngenic wild - type and p53 knockout ( or knockdown ) cell lines ( Supplementary Fig . S6 and Supplementary Movie S4 ) . Although SMIFH2 has been previously reported to exert anti - migratory effects , 39 we found that it increased cell migration between three and five hours of treatment ( Fig . 3 ) . This discrepancy might be due to Rizvi and colleagues exposing NIH3T3 cells to a sub - lethal concentration of SMIFH2 , NIH3T3 and U2OS cells differing in Formin - protein expression , or the experimental setup . At any rate , SMIFH2 perturbs the architecture of the Golgi com - plex independently of p53 expression with a kinetics that differs from those of the actin and the microtubule networks ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 , and Supplemental Movie S6 ) . In this regard , loss of INF2 and activation of Rho - mDia1 pathway have been shown to result in partial dispersal of the Golgi complex in U2OS cells 68 , 69 . As virtually complete loss of visible Golgi structures occurs in U2OS and HCT116 cells treated with SMIFH2 ( Fig . 1A and 2A ) , one or more Formin ( s ) may coop - erate with INF2 in regulating Golgi architecture . The fact that per - turbation of the Golgi complex and centrosomal microtubules are out of synchrony suggests that SMIFH2 might interfere with the dynamics of non - centrosomal microtubules nucleated at the Golgi , which are crucial for proper assembly and functionality of the Golgi complex 75 . Finally , why SMIFH2 does not elicit loss of the Golgi in MEFs warrants future investigation . Remarkably , SMIFH2 - treated cells recovered their original mor - phology after sixteen hours of treatment . Given that intracellular SMIFH2 decays in a few hours , this implies that inhibition of Formins by SMIFH2 is transient and reversible . In light of these considerations , it is notable that mDia2 remains fully silenced also when both the Golgi complex and the cytoskeleton have regained a normal morphology . Overall , our observations reinforce the idea that SMIFH2 may have different binding affinities for and ensuing inhibitory effects on Formins , and that the vast collec - tion of perturbations induced by SMIFH2 ( Table 1 ) results from different subsets of Formins being inhibited at any analysed time point . High SMIFH2 concentration ( 50 m M ) triggered rapid cell death in all tested cell lines ( Supplementary Movie S3 ) , consistent with pre - vious observations and IC 50 ( IC 50 5 28 . 0 m M ) 39 . As our data also show that this SMIFH2 - induced event does not require p53 ( Supplementary Movie S3 ) , further studies should address the mode whereby SMIFH2 promotes cell death . In summary , we showed that the general Formin inhibitor SMIFH2 has profound effects on F - actin , microtubules and integrity of the Golgi complex and influences important cellular processes , such as cell migration and cell division . Unexpectedly , we found that SMIFH2 also reduces the expression and the transcriptional activity of p53 and that this latter property may contribute to SMIFH2 - induced cytoskeletal remodelling .

EGFP - LifeActandmCherry - a - Tubulin - expressingU2OScellsweregenerated by infection with retroviruses packaged in amphotropic Phoenix cells . pECFP - Golgi was transfected using X - tremeGene9 according to manufacturer’s instructions and cells were imaged 24 - 48 hours post - transfection . Cells were lysed in JS lysis buffer ( 50 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 % glycerol and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) supplemented with fresh protease ( 10 m g / ml leupeptin and aprotinin , 1 mM Pefabloc ) and phosphatase inhi - bitors ( 1 mM orthovanadate and 5 mM sodium fluoride ) . Total RNA Isolation and RT - qPCR Analyses . Total RNA from adherent cells was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Complementary DNA synthesis was performed using 1 - 2 m g of mRNA with SuperScript - II H reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Invitrogen ) . Real - time qPCR reactions were set up using 5 - 10 ng of cDNA as a template and gene specific primers ( 200 nM ) in a StepOnePlus TM Real - Time PCR system ( AppliedBiosystems ) . Allreactionsproducedsingleamplicons ( 100 - 200bps ) , which allowed us to equate one threshold cycle difference . RT - qPCR primers are listed in Table 3 and have been previously validated 76 . LuciferaseActivityAssay . 293Tcells ( 5x10 4 cells / well ) wereplatedin24 - wellplates . One day after , cells were transfected with pGL3 - HDM2 - luc ( 100 ng ) using calcium phosphate method . All experiments were carried out in triplicates and the Firefly Luciferase activity was measured 24 hours post - transfection with the Dual - Luciferase H ReporterAssaySystem ( Promega ) usinganEnVision H MultilabelReader ( PerkinElmer ) . Initially , we added HDM2 - Firefly luciferase - based reporter and Renilla luciferase - based co - reporter in a 1 : 10 ratio , which prevented trans effects between the two promoters ( not shown ) . Incomplete quenching of the Firefly luciferaseandlow Renilla luciferaseactivityaffectedthenormalizationofthesamples thereby causing misrepresentation of the effects ( not shown ) . As total DNA amount was kept constant , we obtained very similar transfection efficiencies for different conditions and independent samples . Thus , the Luciferase activity was expressed as arbitrary units / m g of total proteins . Results are normalized against the control samples and represented as relative HDM2 - promoter activities ( mean 6 s . d . ) , as obtained from three independent experiments carried out in technical triplicates . Immunofluorescence and Imaging . Cells were plated on gelatin - coated glass coverslips ( # 1 . 5 ) andfixedwith4 % paraformaldehydeinPIPESbuffer ( 80mMPIPES pH6 . 8 , 5mMEGTA , 2mMMgCl2 ) for10minutes .

Single basal sections with a widened pinhole ( 1 . 5 Airy ) were acquired every 20 minutes . Cells were left in the humidified climate chamber for at least one hour to obtain steady - state conditions prior to the beginning of each experiment . All channels were acquired sequentially . Images were corrected for photobleaching through estimation of the baseline intensity level by curve fitting the background intensities using ‘‘Exponential with offset’’ selection in ImageJ . These estimates were subsequently used for bleach correction in ImageJ with the simple ratio method 81 . Minor drift was corrected using the TurboReg and StackReg plugins in ImageJ 82 .
