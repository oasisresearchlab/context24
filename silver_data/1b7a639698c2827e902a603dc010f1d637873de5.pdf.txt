These networks are made of branched actin filaments generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Here we study under which con - ditions the microscopic organization of branched actin networks builds up a sufficient stress to trigger sustained motility . In our experimental setup , dynamic actin networks or “ gels ” are grown on a hard bead in a controlled minimal protein system containing actin monomers , profilin , the Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein . We vary protein concentrations and follow experimentally and through simulations the shape and mechanical properties of the actin gel growing around beads . Actin gel morphology is controlled by elementary steps including “ primer ” contact , growth of the net - work , entanglement , mechanical interaction and force production . We show that varying the biochemical orchestration of these steps can lead to the loss of network cohesion and the lack of effective force production . We propose a predictive phase diagram of actin gel fate as a function of protein concentrations . This work unveils how , in growing actin networks , a tight biochemical and physical coupling smoothens initial primer - caused heterogeneities and gov - erns force buildup and cell motility . actin force generation ∣ modeling ∣ symmetry breaking I n eukaryotic cells , actin network formation and self - organiza - tion drive a variety of cellular processes including cell polariza - tion , cell motility , and morphogenesis . Motile cells can change their speed and mechanical properties by controlling the bio - chemistry of network assembly . Polymerization of actin mono - mers into a branched network of filaments generates forces that are sufficient for lamellipodium formation and cell migration . In lamellipodia of crawling cells , filament nucleation and branching is triggered through the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex on the side of a preexisting filament ( the “ primer ” ) by nucleation pro - moting factors ( NPFs ) such as proteins from the WASP family ( 1 – 3 ) . This process of branching off filaments repeats itself , lead - ing to the auto - catalytic formation of a network of entangled fila - ments ( 4 ) . However , it is not clear how the microscopic structure , in particular heterogeneities in actin network , impacts the mechanical properties during the production of force at the onset of motility . A major progress in understanding actin - based motility came with the introduction of reconstituted biomimetic systems in - spired by motile pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes ( 5 , 6 ) . These in vitro systems provided evidence for actin - driven force generation and paved the way to biophysical modeling . Over the last decade , several models have been proposed , each of them addressing phenomena on a different scale . One class of models describes actin networks at a macroscopic scale as a continuous elastic gel ( 6 – 9 ) that deforms due to the accumulation of an internal stress generated by actin polymerization . These macro - scopic continuous approaches offer valuable insights into actin - driven force generation , stress buildup prior to symmetry break - ing and network reorganization at a mesoscopic scale ( 7 , 8 , 10 ) . The other class of models rely on the chemical mechanisms responsible for filament nucleation , filament branching and fila - ment entanglement ( 1 , 11 , 12 ) . However , despite experimental and modeling efforts , the link between microscopic properties of actin networks and the production of force at a macroscopic scale remains poorly understood . In this study , our experimental conditions are designed for a true parallel between experiments and modeling . We use well - defined biochemical conditions where actin is maintained in its monomeric form in the bulk buffered by an excess of profilin . In these conditions , actin nucleation is essentially restricted to the surface of micrometer - sized beads coated with an NPF . Our aim is to allow a direct connection between the microscopic struc - ture of the actin network — namely , its branch density , the entan - glement of these filaments , and the resulting gel mechanical properties . To integrate these different scales in the description of the network , we design a model that includes ( i ) primer con - tact , ( ii ) network extension , ( iii ) filament entanglement , and network mechanics . We investigate how the primer - based me - chanism of actin network formation influences the mesoscopic properties of the actin gel formed around the beads . Our results are summarized in a morphology diagram of actin gel and symmetry breaking occurrence around beads providing the link between observed macroscopic properties and microscopic para - meters controlled by biochemical conditions . Results Reconstituted Motility System . We use a G - actin motility system in the presence of excess of profilin ( 1 ) to fully control biochemical reactions on the bead surface . This allows for a thorough descrip - tion of the different steps of actin network formation , spanning from a molecular to a mesoscopic scale . Bead Motility Assay : Observations and Simulations . Beads coated with the NPF ( pWA , see SI Materials and Methods ) are placed in the mixture of purified proteins [ the Arp2 / 3 complex , actin , profilin and capping protein ( CP ) ] . Network formation by primer contact is observed by evanescent wave microscopy ( Fig . 1 A1 ) and governed by the concentration of preformed actin filaments ( 1 ) . In our conditions , 25 primers are necessary on average to Authorcontributions : A . K . , K . C . , R . B . - P . , L . B . , J . - L . M . , andC . S . designedresearch ; A . K . , K . C . , J .

Accordingly , we simulate the contact of 25 primers ( 1 . 5 μ m long on average ) at random posi - tions on the bead surface ( Fig . 1 A2 , SI Materials and Methods , and Movie S1 ) . In addition , we tested that in simulations , an initial number of primers ranging from 25 to 100 has only minor effects on the final outcome . Actin branches are initiated at the site of contact between the primer and the ternary complex constituted of the NPF , the Arp2 / 3 complex and an actin monomer ( Fig . 1 B1 and B2 and Fig . S1 , Left ) ( 1 ) . As the branched network expands , individual actin filaments are not distinguishable anymore using evanescent wave microscopy , and a larger - scale network appears both in epifluorescence microscopy and in simulations ( Fig . 1 C1 and C2 ) , made of actin filament subnetworks , each originating from one single primer . These subnetworks entangle depending on protein conditions ( see below ) . At this stage , simulations are the only way to keep track of each filament , whereas epifluores - cence observation gives only a mesoscopic view of the actin network ( Fig . 1 C1 and D1 ) . We model the effect of the filament entanglement during subnetwork growth by connecting the sub - network barycenters with springs resulting in an elastic force ( Fig . 1 D2 and Fig . S1 , Right ) . The spring stiffness is proportional to the number of entangled filaments . In addition to this elastic force , we take into account a pushing force due to polymeriza - tion , a lifting - up force , and a force due to friction between subnet - works ( see SI Materials and Methods ) . Experimentally , we define symmetry breaking by the appear - ance of a visible heterogeneity in the actin gel around the bead , followed by comet formation ( Fig . 1 E1 and F1 ) . In simulations , symmetry breaking is triggered by the rupture of a spring that stretches twice the resting length D ð t 0 Þ ( see Fig . S1 ) . Symme - try - breaking time is defined when an uncovered surface of at least 200 nm 2 appears after the bead has been fully covered by actin filaments ( see SI Materials and Methods and Fig . 1 E2 ) . Concen - trations of the Arp2 / 3 complex and CP are varied and lead to different fates : either comet formation ( Fig . 1 F1 ) , or no symmetry breaking . Interestingly , both situations are characterized by the appearance of heterogeneities . Because these two cases have dif - ferent fates , we are prompted to investigate their morphological characteristics as a function of time . Gel Heterogeneities Without Symmetry Breaking . We first focus on the case that does not lead to symmetry breaking and comet formation . Angular fluorescence intensity profiles and computed thicknesses ( Fig . 2 A and B ) show that fluorescence increases over time ( Fig . 2 C and D ) because the actin network constantly grows and the angular profiles never overlap . To quantify gel heteroge - neity , we use the relative standard deviation ( RSD ) ( see SI Materials and Methods ) . A constant RSD of 0 . 02 corresponds to a homogeneous gel growth , in the absence or at low concentra - tion of CP ( 10 nM ) , independently of the Arp2 / 3 complex con - centration ( bottom image and black circles in Fig . 2 E , black solid curve in Figs . 2 F and 3 D ) . A heterogeneous gel is characterized by an RSD greater than 0 . 05 ( Fig . 2 E , Top , and F ) . In this case , the time evolution of the RSD is characterized by constant growth Fig . 1 .

Therefore , the heterogene - ities are amplified and persist over time . Emerging Heterogeneities as a Signature of Symmetry Breaking . Compared to the case of no symmetry breaking , the intensity profiles show distinct features . In experiments and simulations ( Fig . 3 A and B ) , the angular profiles show a homogeneous growth followed by an overlap between two subsequent profiles . This overlap always associates with the onset of a symmetry - breaking event ( Fig . 3 A and B , black arrows ) . After a homoge - neous growth of the actin shell , a notch appears ( Fig . 3 C , white arrowhead ) and is followed by comet formation . This sequence of events ( Fig . 3 C ) has the highest percentage of occurrence in a concentration window of 25 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 20 – 30 nM CP for 4 . 5 - μ m - diameter beads . Increasing the Arp2 / 3 complex concentration to 50 nM still results in comet formation for 20 – 50 nM of CP but multiple comets appear ( see below ) . In con - trast to no symmetry - breaking conditions , the RSD parameter slowly increases as a function of time before an explosive raise corresponding to gel fracture ( Fig . 3 D , green arrow ) . These het - erogeneities occur prior to fracture , which is a requirement for symmetry breaking ( Fig . 3 C , white arrowhead ) . Evolution of Actin Gel Thickness as a Function of Time . In the absence of CP , actin filaments grow radially away from the bead as described before ( 1 , 13 ) ( Fig . S2 ) . In all other conditions , a fluorescent shell of actin is observed around the beads , which we characterize by the mean gel thickness ( see SI Materials and Methods ) that display a sharp initial increase followed by a plateau ( Fig . 4 A , B , E , and F ) . Symmetry breaking occurs shortly before or once the pla - teau is reached ( 7 ) , and symmetry - breaking times in simulations match the ones of experiments ( Fig . 4 B and F ) . For 4 . 5 - μ m beads , in protein concentration necessary for mo - tility , symmetry breaks before the plateau , and the symmetry - breaking time distribution is a few minutes wide ( Fig . 4 B ) . To probe the role of mechanics , we vary the mechanical constants K ( spring constant ) and K A ( force constant ) ( see SI Materials and Methods ) and follow their impact on the thickness in simulations ( Fig . 4 D ) . An increase in both constants K and K A generates a decrease of the plateau thickness .

This effect of the mechanical constants is consistent with the presence of mechanical stress during symmetry breaking ( 7 ) . In striking contrast , in conditions where no symmetry breaking occurs , the curves of the modeled thickness over time are independent of the mechanical constants ( Fig . 4 C ) . Note that in these conditions , a true parallel between experiments and model is rendered difficult by the gel thickness close to the optical resolution limit . For 6 - μ m - diameter beads , gel thickness plateaus ( Fig . 4 E and F ) . In conditions for motility , symmetry - breaking time distri - bution can be as wide as 1 h ( Fig . 4 F ) ( 7 ) . In order to elucidate where the actin is incorporated in the gel once the plateau is reached , we use two colors of fluorescent actin sequentially ( Fig . S3 ) ( 10 ) . In conditions where no symmetry breaking occurs , we observe that new actin is incorporated everywhere in the gel ( Fig . 4 G ) , suggesting that not all actin filaments are capped . In conditions where symmetry breaking occurs , new actin is incor - porated mostly at the site of nucleation at the bead surface in agreement with all barbed ends being capped away from the beads ( Fig . 4 H ) . Moreover , in the latter case , actin incorporation is limited , indicating that the plateau corresponds to a slowdown in polymerization due to accumulation of mechanical constraints at the bead surface . Morphology Diagram and Probability Distribution of Symmetry Break - ing and Comet Formation . All different situations corresponding to the occurrence of symmetry breaking are illustrated in a “ mor - phology diagram ” ( Fig . 5 A ) . At zero or low CP concentrations , we observe long filaments around the beads ( Fig . 5 A , Left , and Fig . S2 ) . For low Arp2 / 3 complex concentrations beads display very weak fluorescence ( 12 . 5 nM ; Fig . 5 A , Bottom ) . Symmetry breaking occurs only in a concentration window ( Fig . 5 A , black - dotted line , and Fig . S4 ) with single or multiple comets , as indi - cated by percentage values ( Fig . 5 A and Fig S4 ) . The probability to observe multiple comets increases with increasing Arp2 / 3 complex or CP concentration ( percentages indicated in red and brackets in Fig . 5 ) . Experiments with 6 - μ m beads show a wider motility window with slightly less symmetry - breaking events ( Fig . S5 ) . Note that in these conditions , symmetry breaking oc - curs on the plateau with a wide distribution of symmetry - breaking times ( Fig . 4 F ) . Discussion Choice of Experimental Conditions for Modeling . A major limitation in understanding the link between molecular reaction , network structure and mechanical properties during onset of actin - based motility is due to a lack of quantitative data on the actin network structure and its dynamics ( 14 ) . Distinct models have been devel - oped to try to understand the basic principles of actin - based motility . Those models are either at the filament scale and based on a Brownian ratchet mechanism , or at a mesoscopic scale and based on the mechanical properties of the actin network , and no unified protrusion model could be developed yet ( 14 , 15 ) . One difficulty to span the whole scale from molecules to actin net - works is that experiments are not always sufficiently controlled . We use here tightly - controlled experimental conditions — namely , a profilin - buffered G - actin medium and the prolin - linked Verpro - lin , Cofilin , Acidic ( VCA ) protein , pWA as an NPF . Instead of having actin filaments in the bulk that would compete with actin polymerization at the bead surface , we thus target actin assembly essentially at the bead surface . In such conditions , the contact of drifting “ primers ” on the bead surface is followed by actin subnet - work generation ( 1 , 16 ) , and simulations can be run in parallel in the same protein conditions ( Fig . S6 ) . It is then crucial to control the number of primers because it defines the number of indepen - dent networks that might merge to build up a stress and generate symmetry breaking . In this scheme , the number of primers is con - trolled by the concentration of profilin ( 1 ) . In addition , profilin is also necessary to constrain nucleation to the bead surface . In the absence of profilin , a consequence of uncontrolled bulk nuclea - tion is that both gel growth and symmetry - breaking times are vari - able . Thus , in the absence of profilin , simulations cannot correctly account for nucleation in the bulk . Fig . 5 . ( A ) Diagram of the experimental and simulated actin morphology around 4 . 5 - μ m beads as a function of concentrations in CP and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Experiments are displayed with inverted fluorescence images . In si - mulated actin networks , filaments are in black , free barbed ends are green , and capped barbed ends are red . The black - dotted line encloses the protein conditions leading to symmetry breaking . All images are taken when symme - try breaking occurs or after 1 h for non - symmetry - breaking conditions .

We show that stress build - up originates from both the chemical and the mechanical proper - ties of the system . It depends on the relative concentrations of CP and the Arp2 / 3 complex that control the degree of entanglement of each growing subnetwork emanating from primers . We provide evidence that a sufficient entanglement of the actin filaments al - lows stress to accumulate in the network , and this effect is crucial to control gel thickness , the onset of gel fracture and symmetry breaking . This applies in conditions of symmetry breaking ( Fig . 4 , Right ) , where a change in the spring constant value affects the plateau value of the actin thickness and new actin is incorporated exclusively at the bead surface ( Fig . 4 H ) . Conversely , a limited entanglement prevents stress buildup and does not produce sym - metry breaking . In this case , the plateau of the actin thickness is independent of the spring constant , showing that mechanics do not play a role in network growth ( Fig . 4 , Left , and C ) . As a conclusion , entanglement of the actin subnetworks growing from primers depends on branching and capping and control bead motility fate . Another aspect that is unveiled in this study is that symmetry breaks at the boundary between subnetworks . The ra - tionale for this is given from simple energy estimation . Indeed , the energy for breaking a single actin filament is 31 . 6 kT ( 17 ) . Consequently , fracture of a subnetwork costs an energy that is equal to 31 . 6 kT multiplied by the number of filaments that need to be cut . In comparison , subnetwork separation as modeled in this study requires only filament disentanglement and the filament - filament interactions ( as in the actin bundles ) range between 0 . 05 to 0 . 12 kT per binding site ( 18 ) . In our model , it is therefore more favorable to separate entangled subnetworks than to break across a subnetwork ( see Fig . S7 ) . Experimental evidence for the fact that symmetry breaks more easily in between subnetworks is given in Fig . 5 : When the CP ( or the Arp2 / 3 complex ) concentra - tion is increased , the number of multiple symmetry - breaking events increases . Consistent with these experimental observations , simulations show that the ratio of entanglements versus number of branches per subnetwork decreases for increasing Arp2 / 3 complex or CP concentrations . In these conditions , fracturing within the subnetwork is proven to be less favorable than fracturing between subnetworks . Note that we do not take into account the branching / debranching of actin filaments . Mechanical weaknesses are in - itiated by the primer mechanism , but we cannot exclude that stress - mediated network debranching may also lead to the appearance of small heterogeneities in the actin gel that might create internal rupture of the network . Increasing the biochemical complexity of both experimental setup and model will open the possibility to address further this question . Link between Heterogeneities and Symmetry Breaking . We can dis - tinguish two cases for heterogeneities during actin network for - mation . In the first case , initial heterogeneities due to primers are maintained throughout the course of actin polymerization . Therefore , independent actin networks grow from primer sites and do not merge significantly to fully cover the bead resulting in local and limited forces . In the second case , initial heteroge - neities due to the primer - based mechanism are smoothened by network - merging through filament entanglement . Stress can build up sufficiently , then a crack will appear prior to symmetry breaking . We define this latter case as a productive heterogeneity . Our simulations allow us to predict the origin of this productive heterogeneity , as seen in Fig . 3 . Indeed , the actin network grow - ing from the bead keeps the memory of the boundaries between extending subnetworks creating weak points at which productive crack opens up . We thus provide an explanation for the suggested link ( 7 ) between local heterogeneity and the formation of a crack in the actin gel . Model Parameters and their Influence on Actin Gel Properties . In the model , we obtain a final average number of 75 primers . The distance between primers is at an intermediate scale much larger than the monomer size , and much smaller than the bead dia - meter , thus ensuring a correct description of a continuous net - work . If the number of primers is too low ( < 10 ) , the model is inconsistent with a continuous gel description . Simulations allow us to derive the mesh size of the network , and we note that when symmetry breaking occurs , the mesh size is in the 30 - to 80 nm range ( Fig . 5 A ) . Denser networks or sparser networks do not lead to symmetry breaking . Another parameter of the network is the number of springs connecting the neighboring subnetworks . There is an optimal range for this number , between 8 to 12 . If this number is too low ( < 7 ) , symmetry does not break because there is no sufficient stress buildup ( Fig . 5 A and Fig . S8 ) . If the number of springs per subnetwork is larger than 13 , the network is too dense ( smallest mesh - size ) for symmetry to break . The friction coefficient C T , obtained from best fit with experi - ments , has a value of 1 . 0 pN·s· μ m − 1 . The related viscosity can be obtained by dividing this friction coefficient by the characteristic length of the actin gel , namely the size of an actin subnetwork . Given that there are 75 primers on a 4 . 5 - μ m - diameter bead , this size is on the order of 200 nm , thus giving a viscosity of 5 Pa·s , close to the 15 Pa·s viscosity of actin gels . This confirms the re - levance of our modeling ( 18 ) . The spring stiffness K is found to be 100 pN· μ m − 1 ; the value of K A is 30 pN for an actively poly - merizing entangled filament . Young modulus estimates vary from 500 Pa ( 25 nM of Arp2 / 3 , 50 nM of CP ) to 1 , 000 Pa ( 25 nM of Arp2 / 3 , 20 nM of CP ) with , on average , 5 to 7 entangled filaments between two barycenters and an average spring length of 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 μ m . This range of values for Young moduli agrees well with previous estimations or measurements of mechanical properties of actin networks ( 19 – 21 ) . Model Predictions : Coupling between Kinetics and Mechanics and Re - levance for Cells and Cell Motility . We show here that initial hetero - geneities in the growing actin network are due to primer contact and have two different fates depending on local protein concen - trations : Either these heterogeneities remain during network growth , leading to lack of symmetry breaking , or these heteroge - neities are smoothened , leading to symmetry breaking . ( Fig . 5 A ) . To avoid spontaneous polymerization in cells , actin nucleation is perfectly controlled in space and time , and occurs exclusively at membranes ( Fig . 5 B ) . The geometry of the lamellipodium is dif - ferent from the one of networks around beads , which is closer to the one of blebs . Nevertheless , it remains true in any geometry that heterogeneities arise in actin networks produced at an acti - vating surface like the one of the membrane . In the spherical geo - metry , these heterogeneities are subsequently revealed through symmetry breaking . Our model highlights that the emergence of network heterogeneities is a consequence of a tight biochem - ical control ( Fig . 5 B , Top ) . When the concentrations of Arp2 / 3 complex and CPs are not optimal ( Fig . 5 A ) , heterogeneities per - sist and are even amplified over time . In these conditions , there is no cohesion of the actin network ( Fig . 5 B , Right ) . Directional mo - tility should require interconnectivity of actin cortex over a length that is on the order of the cell size , because the lack of cohesion of the actin network results in the absence of persistent direction - ality in cells ( 22 ) . Our model predicts that if protein concentra - tion conditions allow subnetwork expansion and entanglement , the emerging mechanical properties prevail and smoothen the initial heterogeneities ( Fig . 5 B , Left ) . In these conditions , subnet - works merge into a cohesive gel enabling actin structures to generate a global force necessary for efficient directional cell migration ( 22 ) . Because the actin network originates from sub - networks , local weaknesses still persist and favor cell response during migration . Indeed , a continuous gel made , for example , of an infinite number of primers would provide no weakness , thus preventing the cell from fast adaptation to external cues . In con - 14444 ∣ www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1117096109 Kawska et al . clusion , the balance between biochemistry and mechanics during actin structure formation and the resulting variety of cell shapes allows the cell to produce different motility modes depending on its environment ( 23 ) . Materials and Methods Experimental conditions ( protein , bead preparation , actin gel growth and data processingofgel thickness measurement and symmetry - breakingdetec - tion ) are given in SI Materials and Methods . Descriptions of the chemical reactions used in the model are also given in SI Materials and Methods and Table S1 . General Model Description . Simulation of actin network growth is divided into two sequential parts ( Fig . 1 , Fig . S1 , and Movie S1 ) : ( i ) from time t 0 to t 1 , the kinetics of nucleation , elongation , and capping of isolated actin subnetworks fromprimersatthesurfaceofNPF - coatedbeadsand ( ii ) after t 1 , themechanical interactions that develop once individual subnetworks start to entangle and possibly build up a mechanical stress . The initial number of primers is fixed at 25 , and new primers are allowed to contact the bead surface until total cov - erage of the bead . The final number of primers is 75 on average . The details of filament elongation and branching are given in SI Materials and Methods and in ref . 1 . Mechanical Interactions . The N initial primers are assigned a number i running from 1 to N . At time t 1 , we associate to each different filament subnetwork i originating from primer i its barycenter denoted R i ð t Þ because its position depends on t ( Fig . S1 , Right , red dots ) . Actin subnetworks move in response to four forces : 1 . The pushing force F P . This force originates from actin filaments that poly - merize against the neighboring subnetworks . The number of entangled filaments N Ajk ð t Þ emanating from two neighboring subnetworks j and k is defined as the number of filaments emanating from subnetwork j and whose barbed ends are closer to the barycenter of the second subnet - work k than to the subnetwork j at time t . The pushing force exerted on subnetwork j by the neighboring subnetwork k reads F P ; jk ð t Þ ¼ − K A N Ajk ð t Þ u jk ð t Þ ; where u jk is the unit vector along the line through R j and R k . K A is a para - meter that reflects force per filament . 2 . Thelifting - upforce F L . Thisforceresultsfromtheelongationoffreebarbed ends close to the bead surface . A single filament q , belonging to the actin subnetwork j and with its barbed end stalled against the bead , exerts a force given by the Euler buckling condition ( 1 ) . The total lifting - up force for the subnetwork j is then sum of the force contributions from all stalled filaments . The resulting force is approximately directed along the normal vector n j to the bead . Therefore , the lifting - up force reads F L ; j ¼ γκπ 2 ð ∑ q L − 2 q Þ n j ; where κ is the filament bending rigidity ( κ ¼ L p k B T ¼ 4 . 1 · 10 − 2 pN· μ m 2 , L p ¼ 10 μ m , k B T ¼ 4 . 1 · 10 − 21 J ) , L q is the filament q length , and γ is a di - mensionless numerical prefactor depending on filament geometrical con - ditions . Here , γ ¼ 1 becasue filaments are considered as rigid rods since theirlengthissmallerthan10 μ m , thepersistencelengthofactinfilaments . 3 . The drag force F G . We assume that the relative displacement of subnet - works j and k generates frictional forces proportional to the velocity of the displacement F G ; jk ð t Þ ¼ − C T (cid:1) d R j ð t Þ dt − d R k ð t Þ dt (cid:2) ; where C T is a friction coefficient . 4 . The entanglement elastic force F E . We define the distance D jk ð t Þ as the distance between subnetworks j and k : D jk ð t Þ ¼ j R j ð t Þ − R k ð t Þj : The elastic force due to entanglements thus reads F E ; jk ð t Þ ¼ − KN jk ð t Þð D jk ð t Þ − D jk ð t 1 ÞÞ u jk ð t Þ : The number of entangled filaments N jk ð t Þ is defined as the number of filaments emanating from subnetwork j and entering the subnetwork k at time t ( Fig . S1 ) . The parameter K is a spring constant per filament , and D jk ð t 1 Þ represents the distance between subnetworks j and k at time t 1 . The dynamics of network growth is controlled by balancing all four forces applied to the subnetworks : ∑ k F P ; jk þ F L ; j þ ∑ k F G ; jk þ ∑ k F E ; jk ¼ 0 ; where the summation ∑ k extends over the neighbors of subnetwork j . Note that the elastic force ∑ k F E ; jk and the drag force ∑ k F G ; jk favor the cohesion of the actin gel , whereas the lifting - up force F L ; j favors an outward expansion and the pushing force ∑ k F P ; jk favors a tangential expansion . The mechanical parameters ( spring constant K , force constant K A , friction coefficient C T ) are once determined to give the best fit of experimental data for conditions : 50 nM of Arp2 / 3 and 20 nM of CP . These values are used for all other concen - tration conditions . Unless otherwise stated , K ¼ 100 pN· μ m − 1 , K A ¼ 30 pN , and C T ¼ 1 pN·s· μ m − 1 . The equation of force balance is solved by an implicit second - order method . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS .
