Near the transition , networks are dominated by bending modes and the elastic modulii vanish with an exponent exponent f = 3 . 0 ± 0 . 2 , in contrast with central force percolation which shares the same geometric exponents . This indicates that universality for geometric quantities does not imply universality for elastic ones . The implications of this result for actin - ﬁber networks is discussed . In contrast with ordered crystals , disordered materi - als typically exhibit a complex connection between their collective mechanical properties and the underlying in - teractions between their constituent elements [ 1 ] . In this Rapid Communication , we study this connection between eﬀective elastic theories of a ﬂexible rod network in two dimensions and the fundamental elastic properties of in - dividual rods , along with statistical measures of the net - work connectivity . We focus on cross - link densities to explore the break - down of collective rigidity of the net - work . This vanishing of the static shear modulus in re - lated systems [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] has been termed the rigid - ity percolation transition in analogy to the better under - stood scalar , or conductivity , percolation transition [ 10 ] . Previously [ 2 ] we investigated the internal deformation ﬁeld of a 2d ﬂexible rod network away from the criti - cal point of rigidity percolation , and found a cross - over from aﬃne to nonaﬃne deformation upon changing the mean density between cross links in the network and / or the inherent ﬂexibility of individual rods , which wasl also independently corroborated by another group [ 3 ] . The rigidity percolation transition has been previously studied numerically in a number of model , disordered systems with variations in both the nature of the links ( bonds ) and the disorder of the network . While the rigid - ity transition is ﬁrst order on the Bethe lattice [ 11 ] and in random networks of inﬁnitely rigid rods [ 12 ] , in all other random network models it is continuous and character - ized by a diverging length scale over which the material acquires a ﬁnite , static shear modulus . From the out - set , it is important to distinguish between two diﬀerent classes of physical observables when discussing the long length scale physics at the transition : ( i ) geometric quan - tities which describe the fractal structure of the percolat - ing rigid cluster at the transition ; and ( ii ) elastic prop - erties of the material near the percolation point . In the ﬁrst category are the exponents ν and β , which describe the divergence of the correlation length as one approaches the transition and the probability that a link will be part of the percolating cluster , respectively . In the second category is f , which describes the power law dependence of the system’s elastic moduli upon the approach to the percolation transition from the rigid phase ( see Eq . 3 ) . In lattice models , the control parameter , as for scalar percolation , is the probability of the presence of a link in the diluted lattice . It appears that the nature of disor - der is a relevant variable , since for purely central forces between network nodes , site and bond disorder exhibit quantitatively diﬀerent scaling regimes near the critical point [ 4 , 5 ] . In addition , a third universality class has been postulated in the so - called “bond – bending” model , where bending lattice edges and rotation at vertices cost energy [ 8 , 9 , 13 ] . This suggests that the introduction of a bending modulus in the model is a relevant perturbation at the transition . Pertinent to the current work are the simulations of Latva - Kokko et al . [ 6 , 7 ] . These investigations , depart - ing from previous work , turned to oﬀ – lattice simulations . They constructed two - dimensional random rod networks and applied a topological approach to investigate the rigidity percolation point in random rod networks with Hookean central forces and a bending modulus . The in - troduction of a bending modulus is vital at this stage since the random spring network that is not prestressed has zero – frequency deformation modes at any ﬁnite den - sity of links , and is thus always nonrigid [ 14 ] . Latva - Kokko et al . considered two variants of their model of ﬂexible rods distinguished by the constraint forces im - posed at a cross link : one with cross links that ﬁx the an - gle between intersecting rods by applying local constraint torques , and freely rotating bonds at cross links in the other . In both cases they found that the geometric expo - nents are consistent with those of the rigidity percolation transition in a diluted lattice with central forces . This re - sult suggests that the introduction of bending forces are not relevant perturbations at the critical point in the fol - lowing restricted sense : the exponents associated with length scale and geometry of the spanning , rigid cluster appear to be universal . We use this result later . Their approach , however did not allow them to investigate the scaling exponent for the elastic quantities of their model . This Rapid Communication presents a study of the elastic properties of the rod network identical to the model system studied by Latva - Kokko et al . . We , how - ever , concentrate on the mechanical aspects of the net - work near the transition . It is important to note that this work relates to models of semi - ﬂexible polymer net - works with freely rotating bonds [ 15 ] . This detail of the 2 model distinguishes it from its other close antecedent , the bond - bending model of S . Feng et al . . That lattice – based model has been particularly well described by both nu - merical simulation and real - space renormalization group techniques [ 16 ] . Our model diﬀers in that the two ﬁla - ments that cross at each node contribute independently to that node’s bending energy ; there is no energy cost for relative rotation between rods . Previous lattice cal - culations suggest that the scaling of the elastic constants near the transition depend on such details of the network ; with this in mind , we seek herein to explore the rigidity collapse of sparse actin networks . The principal result of this communication is that the mechanical properties of the ﬂexible rod network at the rigidity percolation transition are distinct from previ - ously investigated models of either lattice – based bond - bending networks or central force networks . This is true despite the fact that the scaling of the size of the per - colating cluster and its fractal geometry ( as determined by Latva - Kokko et al . [ 6 ] ) are identical to that of central force networks . This point highlights the physical in - dependence of geometric / topological exponents and the elastic exponents of the network . We propose that whilst some degree of universality in the elastic properties of dis - ordered systems may exist , such universality classes are smaller and more numerous than for geometric proper - ties ; that is , models with the same geometric exponents ν and β may have distinct elastic exponents f . Our model system below provides a concrete example of this claim . We suspect that the underlying cause of this non – universality is that while the rigidity transition itself de - pends on large scale topological properties of the network that are insensitive to the local details of stress transmis - sion , the moduli of the rigid network near the transition are sensitively determined by only a vanishingly small set of paths for stress propagation . The moduli thus depend on local details of how stress is transmitted through the small set network nodes along the weak points of this path . Diﬀerent force laws at e . g . cross links can there - fore have profound eﬀects on the way in which the moduli vanish at the transition . We numerically evaluated the elastic moduli of random networks of rods at T = 0 , with an energy δ H per unit length δs given by δ H δs = µ 2 (cid:18) δl δs (cid:19) 2 + κ 2 (cid:18) δθ δs (cid:19) 2 ( 1 ) The ﬁrst term on the right hand side describes an elastic restoring force for changes in relative length of the rods , δl / δs , with a spring modulus µ . Bending by an angle δθ incurs an energy cost given by the second term , where the bending modulus κ is the same as in the wormlike chain model [ 15 ] . Cross linked rods are coupled by imposing the same coordinates at intersections . The simulation method is described in detail else - where [ 17 ] ( where we also discuss behavior away from the transition ) , but in brief : rods of length L are de - posited with random orientation and position into a two – dimensional shear cell of dimensions W × W . Each in - tersection is identiﬁed as a cross link , the mean distance between which ( as measured along a rod ) is denoted l c , so that the mean number of crosslinks per rod is L / l c − 1 . Deposition continues until the required cross linking den - sity L / l c has been reached . The system Hamiltonian is constructed from ( 1 ) , and the mechanical equilibrium conﬁguration found by the preconditioned conjugate gra - dient method under the constraint of an applied shear or uniaxial strain . An example is given in Fig . 1 . Stretch Bend FIG . 1 : ( Color online ) The energy density for a network at the transition L / l c ≈ 5 . 933 under an applied shear strain . The line thickness is proportional to the logarithm of the energy density per unit length . Apparent stressed ‘dangling’ ends are artefacts of numerical noise and make no signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the measured quantities discussed below . The calibration bar shows what proportion of the energy is due to stretching . For clarity , a small W = 7 12 L shear cell is shown . There are four lengths in the problem : the system size and rod length W , L respectively ; the mean dis - tance between cross links l c and a length characteriz - ing the ﬂexibility of the rods , l b = p κ / µ . We take L / l c as our dimensionless measure of density rather than q = NL 2 with N the number of rods per unit area , as in [ 6 , 7 , 14 ] . It is straightforward to convert between the two measures using the expression derived in the Appendix . Rigidity percolation occurs at ( L / l c ) trans ≈ 5 . 933 [ 6 ] . For L / l c slightly above this critical point , where ε = ( L / l c ) / ( L / l c ) trans − 1 ∼ 0 + , we write the shear mod - ulus G as G = κ L 3 f (cid:18) ε , l b L , W L (cid:19) ( 2 ) with a similar expression for the Young’s Modulus , Y . For ε > 0 , and suﬃciently large system sizes W , both G and Y depend only on ε and l b / L . Fig . 2 shows G and Y 3 TABLE I : Quoted f for 2d uncorrelated networks Model f Ref .

Both moduli vanish continuously as ε → 0 + , conﬁrming both the nature and location of the transition as claimed in [ 6 ] , to within our data resolution [ 18 ] . Fig . 3 shows that GL 3 / κ is independent of l b / L for suﬃciently small ε , i . e . G is independent of µ near the transition . This suggests that the transition is dominated by bending modes , and we can infer that G would vanish if there were only central force terms in agreement with [ 14 ] . We can conﬁrm the dominance of bending modes at the transition by measuring the proportion of stretching energy for increasing W . As shown in inset of this ﬁgure , this fraction is always small , < 4 % , and may vanish as W → ∞ , as suggested by the ﬁgure and in agreement with both [ 14 ] and our observation that G ∝ κ . By ﬁtting the data to the functional form G = Aε f ( 1 + Bε ) ( 3 ) we ﬁnd f = 3 . 0 ± 0 . 2 , consistent with [ 3 ] , where the error estimate gives the spread of values when the ﬁt - ting procedure is repeated over diﬀerent data subsets . B is always O ( 1 ) , suggesting ( 3 ) is a ‘sensible’ choice . This is compared to known values in Table I . The only possible equality is with central force bond percolation ; however , since the modulus near the transition is domi - nated by bending forces , we do not believe that this near agreement is meaningful . The ﬁt for G can be made to agree with the Young’s modulus data by simply rescal - ing A → A ′ with f and B ﬁxed , as shown in Fig . 2 for l b / L = 0 . 006 . A ′ / A = 2 . 7 ± 0 . 2 , so that the Poisson ratio σ ≡ Y / 2 G − 1 = 0 . 35 ± 0 . 1 at the transition , consistent with the claimed ‘universal’ value of 1 3 [ 19 ] . Independent conﬁrmation of f can be found by placing the system at the critical point ε = 0 and considering the variation of G with W [ 4 , 8 , 9 ] . Scaling arguments sug - gest that G ∼ W − f / ν for suﬃciently large W , where ν is the exponent describing the divergence of the correlation length , which is known for these networks to be in the range of ν = 1 . 17 ± 0 . 02 [ 6 ] . We attempted to ﬁt our data to the same functional form used in [ 9 ] , but the pre - cision with which we can extract the exponent using this approach is not suﬃcient to distinguish our results from either central force or bond – bending models . The num - ber of networks for each attempted W ranged from 400 to 2000 , comparable to lattice models which give much smaller errors . Our lack of precision is likely due to the random nature of our networks , in which the distance be - tween crosslinks varies continuously down to zero so that 10 10 2 10 3 10 4 0 . 1 0 . 25 0 . 5 0 . 75 1 G L 3 / κ o r Y L 3 / κ ε Shear modulus G Young’s modulus FIG . 2 : Dimensionless shear modulus ( lower data set ) and Young’s modulus ( upper set ) for l b / L = 0 . 006 versus ε on log – log axes .

In summary , we have shown that the elastic moduli of ﬂexible random networks with freely rotating crosslinks scale as ε f near to rigidity percolation . The modulus it - self is dominated by bending modes near the transition and vanishes with an exponent f = 3 . 0 ± 0 . 2 . This expo - nent diﬀers from previous reported exponents for models that include bond bending . Our introduction of bend - ing forces , motivated as it was by modelling cross linked F - actin networks , diﬀers in detail from previous work . 4 Our results suggest that , in contrast to the geometric ex - ponents previous reported for this system , the modulus exponent is more highly model dependent . To address the experimental implications of these results for physi - cal actin networks , we note that the continuous transi - tion with true scale invariant behavior exists at only zero temperature . However , zero temperature phase transi - tions can have experimental consequences at ﬁnite tem - perature [ 21 ] as long as it is possible to experimentally access the critical region . We expect that in sparse actin networks the algebraic decay of the static shear modulus will be cut oﬀ only by the entropic elasticity of the net - work [ 22 ] , a small quantity for a stiﬀ polymer network . The experimental observation of this predicted decay , a signature of the T = 0 transition at ﬁnite temperature , may be possible , but such quantitative predictions await a more complete description of the critical regime .

Appendix : Here we derive the relationship between L / l c and the quantity q = NL 2 , where N is the number of rods per unit area , as used in [ 3 , 6 , 7 , 14 ] . Suppose a rod of length L lies along the x – axis of a W × W box , where W ≫ L so that the box shape should not matter . The probability of a second rod , deposited with orienta - tion θ to the x - axis and random position , intersecting the x – axis is ( L / W ) sin θ . Hence the probability of intersect - ing the ﬁrst rod is ( L / W ) 2 sin θ , which , when uniformly averaged over all θ ∈ [ 0 , π ] , becomes p = 2 L 2 / ( πW 2 ) . Since the rods are deposited at random , p is indepen - dent of how many other crosslinks each rod has . The mean number of intersections per rod is therefore simply p times the total number of rods in the system NW 2 , i . e . pNW 2 = 2 L 2 N / π = 2 q / π ( assuming NW 2 ≫ 1 ) . The distribution P n of the number n of cross links for any given rod is Poisson with a mean 2 q / π . If each in - tersection is imagined to ‘cut’ the rod into n + 1 line seg - ments , then the mean length of all such segments is just L / ( h n i + 1 ) = L / ( 2 q / π + 1 ) . However , l c is deﬁned be - tween crosslinks , not between crosslinks and the ends of the rods ( which are dangling and thus do not contribute to the stress ) . In fact , only n − 1 segments contribute to l c . Thus to evaluate l c , we must average the quantity L / ( n + 1 ) over all valid P n with a weighting n − 1 , and normalize accordingly , i . e . l c = P ∞ n = 2 L n + 1 ( n − 1 ) P n P ∞ n = 2 ( n − 1 ) P n ( 4 ) Using the shorthand λ = 2 q / π and the standard proper - ties of the Poisson distribution , we ﬁnd : L l c = λ + e − λ − 1 1 + e − λ + 2 λ ( e − λ − 1 ) , ( 5 ) which is a monotonic increasing function of λ . Note that L / l c ∼ 2 q / π as q → ∞ , and also that L / l c → 3 as q → 0 + , as it should since ( in this limit ) the domi - nant contributions to l c will come from rods with n = 2 crosslinks , for which l c is indeed L / 3 .
