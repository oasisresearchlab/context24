A LAGRANGIAN RELAXATION APPROACH TO THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN Abstract . The b - clique polytope CP nb is the convex hull of the node and edge incidence vectors of all subcliques of size at most b of a com - plete graph on n nodes . Including the Boolean quadric polytope QP n as a special case and being closely related to the quadratic knapsack polytope , it has received considerable attention in the literature . In particular , the max - cut problem is equivalent with optimizing a linear function over QP nn . The problem of optimizing linear functions over CP nb has so far been approached via heuristic combinatorial algorithms and cutting - plane methods . We study the structure of CP nb in further detail and present a new computational approach to the linear optimization problem based on Lucena’s suggestion of integrating cutting planes into a Lagrangian re - laxation of an integer programming problem . In particular , we show that the separation problem for tree inequalities becomes polynomial in our Lagrangian framework . Finally , computational results are presented . 1 . Introduction Consider the complete undirected graph K n = ( V ; E ) on the set V = f 1 ; : : : ; n g of nodes with edge set E . We assume that to every edge e 2 E a weight c e and to every node i 2 V a weight d i is assigned . The weighted maximal b - clique problem ( W CP b ) is to (cid:12)nd , among all complete subgraphs with at most b nodes , a subgraph ( clique ) for which the sum of the weights of all the nodes and edges in the subgraph is maximal . The weighted maximal b - clique problem can be seen as a Boolean qua - dratic problem with a cardinality constraint ( Mehrotra [ 1997 ] ) . On the other hand , ( W CP b ) generalizes the well - studied maximum clique problem , which is known to be NP { hard . Applications of ( W CP b ) can be found , for example , in location theory ( see Sp¨ath [ 1985 ] , Kuby [ 1987 ] , Erkut et al . [ 1990 ] and Ravi et al . [ 1994 ] ) . Other important applications of this optimization model arise in molecular biology ( see Hunting [ 1998 ] ) .

[ 1996 ] , Mehrotra [ 1997 ] , and Macambira and De Souza [ 1997 ] . In these four papers several facet - de(cid:12)ning inequalities are introduced which are used as cutting planes in order to improve the quality of the upper bounds . In Faigle et al . [ 1994 ] upper bounds derived from Lagrangian relaxation are proposed . The usual branch - and - cut approach can be quite successful for special types of problems ( see , e : g : , Barahona et al . [ 1989 ] for the max - cut problem ) . The general case , however , appears to be much harder . The (cid:12)rst three of the afore - mentioned studies deal with graphs with up to 30 nodes whereas { as formulated by Macambira and de Souza { \ the real challenge is to solve problems with n (cid:21) 40 nodes " . The weighted maximal b - clique polytope generalizes the Boolean quadric polytope , which has been studied extensively ( see , e : g : , Padberg [ 1989 ] , Deza and Laurent [ 1992a , b ] , Boros and Hammer [ 1993 ] , Sherali et al . [ 1995 ] and Hardin et al . [ 1995 ] ) . The max - cut problem on graphs ( cf : Barahona and Mahjoub [ 1986 ] ) can be formulated as the problem of optimizing a lin - ear function over the Boolean quadric polytope . On the other hand , the weighted maximal b - clique problem is a special case of the quadratic knap - sack problem . Therefore , the corresponding polytopes are closely related . Various techniques have been proposed for solving quadratic knapsack prob - lems ( see Chaillou et al . [ 1986 ] , Johnson et al . [ 1993 ] , Bretthauer et al . [ 1995 ] and Helmberg et al . [ 1996 ] ) . In the present paper , we propose a relaxation technique that has not been applied before to ( W CP b ) or to the related problems mentioned above . Following an idea of Lucena [ 1992 ] we combine Lagrangian relaxation with the use of cutting planes . We report computational results with a branch - and - cut algorithm based on this relaxation . We expect that the technique can also be fruitfully applied to the related problems . The paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we give an integer programming formulation for ( W CP b ) and review polyhedral results from the literature . In Section 3 , we describe two new classes of facet - de(cid:12)ning inequalities , which we will use in the ( Lagrangian ) branch - and - cut algo - rithm , namely the i - clique inequalities and the generalized clique inequal - ities . These inequalities turn out to de(cid:12)ne facets of the Boolean quadric polytope as well . In Section 4 , we formulate a Lagrangian problem for ( W C b ) which turns out to have solutions with nice properties . The upper bound obtained in this Lagrangian relaxation often is quite good . Adding cutting planes to the objective function , however , we can obtain even stronger bounds as our computational results show . Using cutting planes in a Lagrangian relaxation o(cid:11)ers a considerable ad - vantage over the standard branch - and - cut approach : Because of the special THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM 3 structure of the Lagrangian solutions , we are able to use classes of inequal - ities for which the separation problem is NP - hard in general ( cf . the tree inequalities in Section 4 ) by adding violated inequalities to the objective function of the Lagrangian relaxation without changing the structure of the Lagrangian solutions . 2 . The b - clique polytope We formulate the weighted maximal b - clique problem ( W C b ) as an integer programming problem . We introduce for every node i 2 V a ( 0 ; 1 ) - variable x i and for every edge e 2 E a ( 0 ; 1 ) - variable y e . We think of an edge e 2 E as a subset of V of cardinality 2 . In particular , if e = f i ; j g , we call i and j the endpoints of e . Variable x i equals 1 if node i is in the clique and 0 otherwise , and y e equals 1 if edge e is in the clique and 0 if not . The weighted maximal b - clique problem can then be formulated as follows : max X i 2 V d i x i + X e 2 E c e y e ( 1 ) subject to the constraints X i 2 V x i (cid:20) b ( 2 ) y e − x i (cid:20) 0 for all e = f i ; j g 2 E ( 3 ) x i + x j − y e (cid:20) 1 for all e = f i ; j g 2 E ( 4 ) x i 2 f 0 ; 1 g for all i 2 V ( 5 ) y e (cid:21) 0 for all e 2 E ( 6 ) Note that the constraints ( 3 ) { ( 6 ) , in fact , imply the seemingly stronger integrality property y e 2 f 0 ; 1 g for all e 2 E . Also observe that ( 2 ) becomes redundant if b = n . We denote the convex hull of the feasible solutions by CP nb = conv f ( x ; y ) 2 R n ( n + 1 ) = 2 j ( x ; y ) satis(cid:12)es ( 2 ) { ( 6 ) g ( 7 ) and call it the b - clique polytope . It is easy to see that the b - clique polytope is full - dimensional if b (cid:21) 2 , i : e : , dim CP nb = n ( n + 1 ) = 2 : Consequently , each facet - de(cid:12)ning inequality for CP nb is unique up to scalar multiplication . Because CP nb − 1 (cid:18) CP nb , each inequality that is valid for CP nb is also valid for CP nb − 1 . Moreover , if a valid inequality for CP nb is facet - de(cid:12)ning for CP nb − 1 , it is also facet - de(cid:12)ning for CP nb . 4 MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN Remark 2 . 1 . It is interesting to observe that the ( valid ) inequalities x i (cid:21) 0 and x i (cid:20) 1 are not facet - de(cid:12)ning for CP nb whenever n (cid:21) 2 as they are implied by the constraints ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) . Similarly , inequality ( 2 ) is not facet - de(cid:12)ning . The vertices ( x ; y ) of CP nb corresponding to cliques of size b satisfy the two independent equations X i 2 V x i = b and X e 2 E y e = b ( b − 1 ) = 2 and thus cannot generate a hyperplane . ( See also Lemma 3 . 1 below ) . The b - clique polytope is closely related to the Boolean quadric polytope and the quadratic knapsack polytope . Other polytopes related to the b - clique polytope are the clique partitioning polytope ( Gr¨otschel and Wak - abayashi [ 1990 ] ) and the cut polytope , which arises from the max - cut prob - lem ( see , e : g : , Barahona and Mahjoub or Deza and Laurent [ 1992a , b ] ) . To make the relationship clearer , we present an equivalent formulation of the maximal edge - weighted b - clique problem . Let the ( n (cid:2) n ) - matrix D = ( d ij ) be given and consider the quadratic optimization problem max X i ; j 2 V d ij x i x j ( 8 ) subject to the constraints ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) . Because x 2 i = x i and y f i ; j g : = x i x j (cid:21) 0 holds , the quadratic problem ( 8 ) is equivalent to the linear problem ( 1 ) with parameters d i : = d ii and c f i ; j g : = d ij + d ji , i 6 = j . For the rest of the paper , we introduce the following notation . Given a vector ( x ; y ) 2 R n ( n + 1 ) = 2 and subset S (cid:18) V , we denote by E ( S ) the set of edges with both endpoints in S and let x ( S ) = X i 2 S x i and y ( S ) = X e 2 E ( S ) y e : ( 9 ) Each S (cid:18) V with j S j (cid:20) b corresponds to a feasible solution ( x S ; y S ) for ( W CP b ) in the obvious way . We call ( x S ; y S ) the incidence vector of S and x S the node incidence vector of S . 2 . 1 . Relationship with the Boolean quadric polytope . The Boolean quadric polytope QP n was introduced by Padberg [ 1989 ] in his study of the unconstrained quadratic zero - one programming problem . In our notation , we have QP n = CP nn ; ( 10 ) i : e : , the Boolean quadric polytope is exactly the weighted b - clique polytope with parameter b = n . THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM 5 Every valid inequality for QP n is , of course , valid for CP nb for any b (cid:20) n . However , not all facet - de(cid:12)ning inequalities of QP n also de(cid:12)ne facets of CP nb . Nevertheless , interesting special cases enjoying this property exist . Examples are the \ trivial " inequalities mentioned in the following result due to Padberg [ 1989 ] and Park et al . [ 1996 ] . Proposition 2 . 1 . Let n (cid:21) 3 and b (cid:21) 2 . Then for all e = f i ; j g 2 E : ( i ) The inequality y e (cid:21) 0 de(cid:12)nes a facet of CP nb . ( ii ) The inequalities y e − x i (cid:20) 0 and x i + x j − y e (cid:20) 1 de(cid:12)ne facets of CP nb if and only if b (cid:21) 3 . (cid:5) The following proposition exhibits two more classes of inequalities that are facet - de(cid:12)ning for both QP n and CP nb . Proposition 2 . 2 . ( i ) For any S (cid:18) V with j S j (cid:21) 1 and T (cid:18) V − S with j T j (cid:21) 2 , the cut inequality X i 2 S ; j 2 T y f i ; j g − y ( S ) − y ( T ) − x ( S ) (cid:20) 0 ( 11 ) de(cid:12)nes a facet of CP nb if and only if either j S j = 1 and b (cid:21) 3 or j S j (cid:21) 2 and b (cid:21) 4 . ( ii ) For any S (cid:18) V with j S j (cid:21) 3 and integer (cid:11) , 1 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) j S j− 2 , the clique inequality (cid:11)x ( S ) − y ( S ) (cid:20) (cid:11) ( (cid:11) + 1 ) 2 ( 12 ) de(cid:12)nes a facet of CP nb if and only if either (cid:11) (cid:20) b − 2 or S = V and (cid:11) (cid:20) b − 1 . (cid:5) Remark 2 . 2 . The fact that the inequalities in Proposition 2 . 2 are facet - de(cid:12)ning for CP nb was already observed by Park et al . [ 1996 ] . However , the statement and proof concerning the clique inequalities is not quite correct there . It is claimed that for every 1 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) j S j − 2 inequality ( 12 ) with S = V de(cid:12)nes a facet , which is not true if (cid:11) (cid:21) b ( cf : Hunting [ 1998 ] ) . Recently , Macambira and De Souza [ 1996 ] presented the following class of facet - de(cid:12)ning inequalities for CP nb that generalizes the cut inequalities . 6 MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN Proposition 2 . 3 . Let S (cid:18) V with j S j (cid:21) 1 and T (cid:18) V − S with j T j (cid:21) 2 be two disjoint subsets of nodes . For nonnegative integers (cid:11) and (cid:12) such that (cid:11) − (cid:12) = 1 , and j T j (cid:21) (cid:11) + 1 , the ( (cid:11) ; (cid:12) ) - inequality X i 2 S ; j 2 T y f i ; j g − y ( S ) − y ( T ) − (cid:11)x ( S ) + (cid:12)x ( T ) (cid:20) 1 2 (cid:11)(cid:12) ( 13 ) de(cid:12)nes a facet of CP nb if (cid:11) (cid:20) b − 4 . (cid:5) Macambira and De Souza furthermore proved that the ( (cid:11) ; (cid:12) ) - inequalities de(cid:12)ne facets of QP n . Their result generalizes a result of Padberg [ 1989 ] for the so - called generalized cut - inequalities . We will derive a class of facet - de(cid:12)ning inequalities that generalizes the clique inequalities in Section 3 . 2 . 2 . Relationship with the quadratic knapsack polytope . Given a vector w = ( w 1 ; : : : ; w n ) 2 R n , we de(cid:12)ne the quadratic knapsack polytope QKP nb ( w ) as the convex hull of those vectors ( x ; y ) 2 R n ( n + 1 ) = 2 satisfying the conditions ( 3 ) { ( 6 ) together with the following knapsack generalization of ( 2 ) : X i 2 V w i x i (cid:20) b : ( 14 ) The linear optimization problem over QKP nb ( w ) generalizes the classical knapsack problem to quadratic objective functions . This general problem occurs , for example , as a subproblem in the work of Johnson et al . . Letting QKP nb denote the knapsack polytope QKP nb ( w ) in the special case w = ( 1 ; 1 ; : : : ; 1 ) , i : e : , with ( 2 ) for ( 14 ) , we obtain the weighted b - clique polytope as CP nb = QKP nb . . The two classes of inequalities mentioned in the following proposition are facet - de(cid:12)ning for QKP nb ( see Johnson et al . [ 1993 ] and Park et al . [ 1996 ] ) . Proposition 2 . 4 . ( i ) For any node i 2 V the star inequality X e 3 i y e − ( b − 1 ) x i (cid:20) 0 ( 15 ) de(cid:12)nes a facet of CP nb if and only if b (cid:20) n − 1 . ( ii ) Let T be a sub - tree of K n with set of nodes V ( T ) , j V ( T ) j = b + 1 , and set of edges E ( T ) , j E ( T ) j = b . Let 3 (cid:20) b (cid:20) n − 1 . Then the tree inequality X e 2 E ( T ) y e − X i 2 V ( T ) ( (cid:14) i − 1 ) x i (cid:20) 0 ( 16 ) where (cid:14) i is the degree of node i in T , de(cid:12)nes a facet of CP nb if and only if T is not a star or b = n − 1 . THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM 7 (cid:5) Tree inequalities were also considered by Macambira and De Souza [ 1996 ] . They combined a tree inequality with an ( (cid:11) ; (cid:12) ) - inequality for (cid:11) = 2 and (cid:12) = 1 , and showed that the resulting inequality is facet - de(cid:12)ning if the un - derlying tree is a path . Since the resulting inequalities do not seem to be very useful in practice , we do not present them in detail here . We men - tion that the separation problem for the tree inequalities is NP { complete ( Hunting [ 1998 ] ) . 3 . New facets for the b - clique polytope We say that the collection C = f C 1 ; : : : ; C m g of nodes of K n is a gener - ating system of cliques if the associated clique incidence vectors ( x C ; y C ) , C 2 C , generate an ( a(cid:14)ne ) hyperplane in R n ( n + 1 ) = 2 . If C is a generating system of cliques , there exists a vector a 6 = 0 and a number a 0 such that a ( x C ; y C ) = a 0 for all C 2 C : Moreover , up to scalar multiplication , ( a ; a 0 ) is uniquely determined by C . We say in this case that a ( x ; y ) = a 0 is a feasible equality for the generating system C . Let a ( x ; y ) = a 0 be a linear equality . Restricting the vector a to the com - ponents corresponding to x and to y respectively , let us write the equality a ( x ; y ) = a 0 as a ( 1 ) x + a ( 2 ) y = a 0 : Then we observe Lemma 3 . 1 . Assume n (cid:21) 2 , and let a ( 1 ) x + a ( 2 ) y = a 0 be a feasible equality for the generating system C of cliques . Then a ( 2 ) 6 = 0 . Proof . Suppose a ( 2 ) = 0 . We will derive a contradiction . Notice that a ( 1 ) 6 = 0 must hold ( otherwise a = 0 would contradict our assumption that a ( x ; y ) = a 0 is a feasible equality ) . Suppose that a ( 1 ) has exactly one non - zero coe(cid:14)cient a ( 1 ) 1 , say . By scalar multiplication , we may assume a ( 1 ) = 1 . Then the equality a ( x ; y ) = a 0 can only be x 1 = 1 or x 1 = 0 . In the case x 1 = 1 , however , the cliques in C also satisfy the equality x 2 − y f 12 g = 0 . Hence , the incidence vectors ( x C ; y C ) , C 2 C , lie in the intersection of two distinct hyperplanes and , therefore , could not generate a hyperplane . Similarly , in the case x 1 = 0 , the cliques C 2 C would also satisfy the equality y f 12 g = 0 and thus could not generate a hyperplane . So we conclude that a ( 1 ) has at least two non - zero coe(cid:14)cients a ( 1 ) 1 and a ( 1 ) 2 , say . 8 MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN Every incidence vector ( x C ; y C ) , C 2 C , satis(cid:12)es a ( x C ; y C ) = a ( 1 ) ( x C ) = P ni = 1 a ( 1 ) i x Ci = a 0 . Squaring this equality , we obtain n X i = 1 [ a ( 1 ) i ] 2 [ x Ci ] 2 + X i 6 = j a ( 1 ) i a ( 1 ) j x Ci x Cj = a 20 : Because [ x Ci ] 2 = x Ci and x Ci x Cj = y C f i ; j g , we see that the vector ( x C ; y C ) also satis(cid:12)es the linear equation X i 2 V [ a ( 1 ) i ] 2 x i + X f i ; j g2 E 2 a ( 1 ) i a ( 1 ) j y f i ; j g = a 20 : Since a ( 1 ) 1 a ( 1 ) 2 6 = 0 , the latter equation is independent from a ( x ; y ) = a 0 , which implies that the clique incidence vectors lie in the intersection of two distinct hyperplanes , a contradiction to our assumption that C is a generating system of cliques . Lemma 3 . 2 . Assume n (cid:21) 2 , and let C be a generating system of cliques with associated incidence vectors ( x C ; y C ) , C 2 C . Then the projected node incidence vectors x C , C 2 C , generate R n . Proof . If the Lemma were false , the vectors x C would be contained in a hyperplane of R n , i : e : , we could (cid:12)nd a vector a ( 1 ) 6 = 0 and a number a 0 such that a ( 1 ) x C = a 0 for all C 2 C . With a = ( a ( 1 ) ; 0 ) , we see that the generating system C would thus satisfy the equality a ( x ; y ) = a 0 , which contradicts Lemma 3 . 1 . Let C = f C 1 ; : : : ; C n + 1 ; C n + 2 ; : : : ; C m g be a generating system of cliques of K n . In view of Lemma 3 . 2 , we may assume that the node incidence vectors x C 1 ; : : : ; x C n + 1 are a(cid:14)nely independent . We say that C is b - strong if j C 1 j (cid:20) : : : (cid:20) j C n + 1 j (cid:20) b − 1 holds . Note that j C 1 j (cid:20) b − 2 must hold if C is b - strong : otherwise , the n + 1 vectors x C k , 1 (cid:20) k (cid:20) n + 1 , would satisfy the linear equality P i 2 V x i = b − 1 and hence could not be a(cid:14)nely independent . With the generating system C of cliques of K n we associate its canonical extension C relative to K N , N > n , as follows . C consists of the following collections of subsets of nodes of K N : S 0 : = f C j C 2 Cg S l : = f C k [ f l g j k = 1 ; : : : ; n + 1 g ( for l = n + 1 ; : : : ; N ) T : = f C 1 [ f l ; s g j n + 1 (cid:20) l < s (cid:20) N g ( Note that T = ; if N = n + 1 and that the cardinality of each clique in S l and T is bounded by b if C is b - strong ) . THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM 9 Theorem 3 . 1 . ( \ Lifting Theorem " ) . If n (cid:21) 2 and C is a generating system relative to K n , then the canonical extension C is a generating system relative to K N . Proof . Let C = f C 1 ; : : : ; C m g . The canonical extension C of C cannot gen - erate all of R N ( N + 1 ) = 2 since the feasible equation a ( x ; y ) = a 0 for C yields an equality satis(cid:12)ed by C in an obvious way ( cf . the \ canonical extension " of an inequality below ) . To see that C does indeed generate a hyperplane , there is no loss of gener - ality when we assume that the associated incidence vectors ( x C ; y C ) , C 2 C , are a(cid:14)nely independent . So m = n ( n + 1 ) = 2 and hence jCj = N ( N + 1 ) = 2 . It then su(cid:14)ces to show that the clique incidence vectors associated with C are a(cid:14)nely independent . The incidence vectors corresponding to cliques in T are independent of all the others ( due to their unique 1 - entry in the y - coordinate ( l ; s ) ) . Thus , suppose that there exists some non - trivial a(cid:14)ne relation among the other incidence vectors : n ( n + 1 ) = 2 X j = 1 (cid:21) j ( x C j ; y C j ) + N X l = n + 1 n + 1 X k = 1 (cid:22) lk ( x C k [ f l g ; y C k [ f l g ) = 0 with P (cid:21) j + P (cid:22) lk = 0 . By assumption , the incidence vectors corresponding to S 0 are a(cid:14)nely independent . Hence we must have (cid:22) lk 6 = 0 for some l and k . Considering the x - coordinate corresponding to node l , we conclude P k (cid:22) lk = 0 . Moreover , considering the y - coordinates corresponding to edges joining l to a node in C k , k = 1 ; : : : ; n + 1 , we note that these are in one - to - one correspondence with the node incidence vector of C k . So the above relation actually implies an a(cid:14)ne relation among the node incidence vectors of C 1 ; : : : ; C n + 1 , which contradicts Lemma 3 . 2 and our labeling of C . We want to generalize Padberg’s [ 1989 ] concept of a canonical extension of a valid inequality . If a ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 is a valid inequality for CP nb , we de(cid:12)ne its canonical extension a (cid:3) ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 to K N by a (cid:3) i = a i 8 i 2 V ; a (cid:3) i = 0 8 i 2 V 0 n V a (cid:3) e = a e 8 e 2 E ( V ) ; a (cid:3) e = 0 8 e 2 E ( V 0 ) n E ( V ) ; where V = f 1 ; : : : ; n g and V 0 = f 1 ; : : : ; N g . Trivially , the canonical exten - sion of a valid inequality for CP nb is valid for CP Nb . 10 MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN If a ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 is facet - de(cid:12)ning for CP nb , then the system C of all cliques C such that j C j (cid:20) b and a ( x C ; y C ) = a 0 is a generating system of cliques . We say that a ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 is b - strong if the associated generating system C is b - strong . Corollary 3 . 1 . Let a ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 be a b - strong facet - de(cid:12)ning inequality for CP nb , n (cid:21) 2 . Then its canonical extension is facet - de(cid:12)ning for any CP Nb with N > n . Proof . If C is the generating system of cliques associated with the facet - de(cid:12)ning inequality a ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 , then the incidence vectors of the cliques C in the canonical extension C of C obviously satisfy the equality a (cid:3) ( x C ; y C x ) = a 0 . So a (cid:3) ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 must be facet - de(cid:12)ning for CP Nb . Corollary 3 . 2 . ( Padberg [ 1989 ] ) . If a ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 is a facet - de(cid:12)ning in - equality for the Boolean quadric polytope QP n , then its canonical extension a (cid:3) ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 is facet - de(cid:12)ning for QP n + 1 . Proof . a (cid:3) ( x ; y ) (cid:20) a 0 is valid for QP n + 1 = CP n + 1 n + 1 . By Theorem 3 . 1 , it must be facet - de(cid:12)ning . 3 . 1 . Reformulation - Linearization Technique . A useful technique for (cid:12)nding new valid inequalities of a polytope corresponding to an integer zero - one programming problem is the so - called Reformulation - Linearization Technique ( RLT ) as introduced by Sherali and Adams [ 1990 ] . ( This work is related to Lov(cid:19)asz and Schrijver [ 1991 ] . ) The RLT consists of two steps , namely a reformulation step and a lin - earization step . In the reformulation step problem constraints are multiplied with d - degree polynomial factors composed of the n binary variables ( in our case x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) and their complements , for some (cid:12)xed d 2 f 0 ; 1 ; : : : ; n g . The resulting nonlinear program is then linearized by introducing new vari - ables . For our purposes , we use only degree - 1 polynomial factors . As an example , consider the inequality ( 2 ) X j 2 V x j (cid:20) b ; which is not facet - de(cid:12)ning ( cf : Lemma 3 . 1 ) . Multiplication by ( 1 − x i ) , for some (cid:12)xed i 2 V , yields ( b − 1 ) x i + X j 2 V x j − X e 3 i y e (cid:20) b ; which is easily seen to be facet - de(cid:12)ning . ( We again employ the relations x 2 i = x i and x i x j = y f i ; j g for the binary variables x i and x j ) . THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM 11 As a second example , consider the clique inequality (cid:11)x ( V ) − y ( V ) (cid:20) (cid:11) ( (cid:11) + 1 ) 2 ( 17 ) for some integer 1 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) b − 1 . Multiplying ( 17 ) with x i , we obtain (cid:11)x i + (cid:11) X e 3 i y e − x i X f 2 E y f (cid:20) (cid:11) ( (cid:11) + 1 ) 2 x i : Instead of introducing new variables w if = x i y f , we just use the relation x i y f (cid:20) y f in order to obtain the i - clique inequality (cid:11) X e 3 i y e − y ( V ) − (cid:11) ( (cid:11) − 1 ) 2 x i (cid:20) 0 : ( 18 ) The way we derived ( 18 ) from ( 17 ) implies that ( 18 ) is a valid inequality for CP nb . ( This can also be veri(cid:12)ed directly ) . Theorem 3 . 2 . For every integer (cid:11) , 2 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) b − 1 (cid:20) n − 2 , the i - clique inequality ( 18 ) is facet - de(cid:12)ning for CP nb . Proof . We will exhibit a set of n ( n + 1 ) = 2 a(cid:14)nely independent elements of CP nb satisfying a given i - clique inequality with equality . Consider the incidence vectors ( x C ; y C ) for C = ; ; C = f j g , j 6 = i , and all subsets C (cid:18) V with i 2 C and j C j 2 f (cid:11) ; (cid:11) + 1 g . It is straightforward to check that all of these incidence vectors satisfy ( 18 ) with equality . We leave it to the reader to verify that these incidence vectors also span a subspace of co - dimension 1 . ( Because (cid:11) (cid:20) n − 2 , there are \ su(cid:14)ciently many " candidate sets C ) . The i - clique inequalities are obviously b - strong . So we can apply Corol - lary 3 . 1 in the case n = b + 1 and obtain Corollary 3 . 3 . Let S (cid:18) V and 2 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) min f b − 1 ; j S j − 2 g . Then the \ lifted i - clique inequality " (cid:11) X j 2 S n i y f i ; j g − y ( S ) − (cid:11) ( (cid:11) − 1 ) 2 x i (cid:20) 0 is facet - de(cid:12)ning for CP nb . (cid:5) We refer the interested reader to Hunting [ 1998 ] for other classes of facet - inducing inequalities . Applying the technique of \ sequential lifting " ( cf : Wolsey [ 1975 ] ) , one can , for example derive the following class of generalized clique inequalities : 12 MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN (cid:11) [ x ( S ) − X i 2 S ; j 2 T y f i ; j g ] − y ( S ) (cid:20) (cid:11) ( (cid:11) + 1 ) 2 [ 1 − x ( T ) + y ( T ) ] for S (cid:18) V , T (cid:18) V n S and 1 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) j S j − 2 . 4 . Lagrangian relaxation We now assume in our model for the weighted clique problem that we have a complete directed graph ~ K n = ( V ; A ) that di(cid:11)ers from K n in that each edge e = f i ; j g 2 E is split into two arcs : ( i ; j ) and ( j ; i ) , both in A . We assume that each arc in ~ K n has a weight that equals half the weight of the corresponding edge in K n . For each arc ( i ; j ) in ~ K n , we de(cid:12)ne a ( 0 ; 1 ) - variable ~ y ij that takes the value 1 if the arc ( i ; j ) is in the clique , and value 0 otherwise . With these new variables , ( W CP b ) can be transformed into the problem max n X i = 1 d i x i + X ( i ; j ) 2 A c ij 2 ~ y ij ( 19 ) subject to x i + x j − ~ y ij (cid:20) 1 ; 1 (cid:20) i < j (cid:20) n ( 20 ) ~ y ij = ~ y ji 1 (cid:20) i < j (cid:20) n ( 21 ) ~ y ij − x i (cid:20) 0 ; 1 (cid:20) i 6 = j (cid:20) n ( 22 ) The star inequalities for 2 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) b − 1 : n X j = 1 j 6 = i ~ y ij − ( b − 1 ) x i (cid:20) 0 ; 1 (cid:20) i (cid:20) n ( 23 ) The clique inequalities for S = V , 1 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) b − 1 : (cid:11) n X i = 1 x i − 1 2 X ( i ; j ) 2 A ~ y ij (cid:20) (cid:11) ( (cid:11) + 1 ) 2 ; ( 24 ) The i - clique inequalities for 1 (cid:20) i (cid:20) n and 2 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) b − 1 : (cid:11) n X j = 1 j 6 = i ~ y ij − 1 2 X ( j ; k ) 2 A ~ y jk − (cid:11) ( (cid:11) − 1 ) 2 x i (cid:20) 0 ; ( 25 ) THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM 13 x i 2 f 0 ; 1 g ; 1 (cid:20) i (cid:20) n ( 26 ) ~ y ij 2 f 0 ; 1 g ; 1 (cid:20) i 6 = j (cid:20) n : ( 27 ) When we now dualize the ( in ) equalities ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) by using Lagrangian multipliers u (cid:21) 0 and w , we obtain the Lagrangian problem ( L u ; w ) : max n X i = 1 d i x i + X ( i ; j ) 2 A c ij 2 ~ y ij ( 28 ) + X ( i ; j ) 2 A u ij ( 1 − x i − x j + ~ y ij ) + X ( i ; j ) 2 A w ij ( ~ y ji − ~ y ij ) subject to ( 22 ) { ( 27 ) . An optimal solution of the Lagrangian relaxation ( L u ; w ) can be e(cid:14)ciently computed as a consequence of the following observation . Lemma 4 . 1 . A ( 0 ; 1 ) - vector ( x ; ~ y ) satis(cid:12)es the constraints ( 22 ) { ( 27 ) if and only if there exists an integer p 2 f 0 ; 1 ; : : : ; b g such that n X i = 1 x i = p ( 29 ) X j 2 V n i ~ y ij = ( p − 1 if x i = 1 0 otherwise . ( 30 ) Proof . Assume that the ( 0 ; 1 ) - vector ( x ; ~ y ) satis(cid:12)es ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) . Then the conditions ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) are clearly satis(cid:12)ed . Inequality ( 24 ) is equivalent with ( (cid:11) − p ) ( (cid:11) − p + 1 ) (cid:21) 0 ; which holds because (cid:11) and p are integers . Inequality ( 25 ) follows in the same way . Conversely , assume that the ( 0 ; 1 ) - vector ( x ; ~ y ) satis(cid:12)es ( 22 ) { ( 27 ) . Adding all the star inequalities ( 23 ) and twice the clique inequality ( 24 ) with (cid:11) = b − 1 , we deduce P x i (cid:20) b . Let p : = P x i . If p = 0 , then ( 30 ) is an immediate consequence of ( 22 ) . If p = b , then ( 23 ) implies that \ (cid:20) " holds in ( 30 ) . On the other hand , we see from ( 24 ) with (cid:11) = b − 1 that P i ; j ~ y ij (cid:21) b ( b − 1 ) must hold . So ( 30 ) ) is satis(cid:12)ed with equality . Finally , consider the case 1 (cid:20) p (cid:20) b − 1 . When we add all i - clique inequalities ( 25 ) with x i = 1 for (cid:11) = p ( choose (cid:11) = 2 in the case p = 1 ) , we 14 MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN obtain X i ; j ~ y ij (cid:20) p ( p − 1 ) : On the other hand , ( 24 ) with (cid:11) = p shows X i ; j ~ y ij (cid:21) p ( p − 1 ) : Hence equality holds . Substitution of this equality into ( 25 ) with (cid:11) = p now yields the desired result . In view of Lemma 4 . 1 , we can solve problem ( L u ; w ) in a straightforward way in time O ( n 2 log n ) : Note that the objective function of ( L u ; w ) can the written as max X i 2 V ~ d i x i + X ( i ; j ) 2 A ~ c ij ~ y ij : Thus , for p = 0 ; 1 ; : : : ; b , we ( greedily ) choose the p \ best " nodes i 2 V , i : e : , those nodes i for which the weight ~ d i plus the weights ~ c i ; j of the corre - sponding p heaviest arcs ( i ; j ) is as large as possible ) . We (cid:12)nally compare these b + 1 candidate solutions and we take the one with the best objective function value . 4 . 1 . Improving the Lagrangian Relaxation . Let L ( u ; w ) denote the optimal value of the Lagrangian problem ( L u ; w ) with respect to the objective ( 28 ) . Since L ( u ; w ) is an upper bound on the objective function value of our integer program ( W CP b ) of Section 2 , we are interested in solving the problem min f L ( u ; w ) j u (cid:21) 0 ; w g in order to obtain good bounds for a branch - and - bound algorithm ( see also Section 5 ) . One could theoretically improve the Lagrangian bound by dualizing all of the inequalities known to be facet - generating for the polytope CP nb . Typ - ically , however , there are too many facet - generating inequalities to make this procedure computationally feasible in practice . So we want to dualize a valid inequality only when it has been found to be violated by the current Lagrangian solution . This implies that we need an e(cid:14)cient algorithm to detect violated inequalities . As an illustration , we give such a separation algorithm for the tree inequalities ( cf : Proposition 2 . 4 ) . We expect that , e : g : , the clique and cut inequalities can be treated similarly . It is NP - hard to (cid:12)nd a tree inequality that is violated by a given vector ( x ; ~ y ) 2 R n 2 ( Hunting [ 1998 ] ) . We will show , however , that this separation problem can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to ( 0 ; 1 ) - vectors THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM 15 ( x ; ~ y ) satisfying inequalities ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) . This means that we can solve the separation problem for tree inequalities with respect to the solutions of our Lagrangian relaxation of ( W CP b ) . Let T be a tree in K n with set V ( T ) of nodes and set E ( T ) of ( undirected ) edges . Denoting by (cid:14) i ( T ) the degree of node i 2 V ( T ) with respect to T , we set ! ( T ) : = X f i ; j g2 E ( T ) 1 2 ( ~ y ij + ~ y ji ) − X i 2 V ( T ) ( (cid:14) i ( T ) − 1 ) x i : ( 31 ) Thus ( x ; ~ y ) violates the tree inequality associated with the tree T if and only if ! ( T ) > 0 . Proposition 4 . 1 . Assume that the ( 0 ; 1 ) - vector ( x ; ~ y ) satis(cid:12)es the condi - tions of Lemma 4 . 1 . Then ( x ; ~ y ) satis(cid:12)es all tree inequalities if and only if ~ y ij (cid:20) x j 1 (cid:20) i 6 = j (cid:20) n : ( 32 ) Proof . Assume that ( 32 ) holds for the vector ( x ; ~ y ) and let T be a tree with j V ( T ) j = b + 1 nodes . Since P i x i (cid:20) b , there exists a node r 2 V ( T ) with x r = 0 . Starting from this \ root " r , we can compute ! ( T ) recursively by iteratively adding an edge ( i ; j ) to the subtree T 0 of T already constructed . If T 00 denotes this augmented tree with the new node j , we observe ! ( T 00 ) = ! ( T 0 ) + 1 2 ( ~ y ij + ~ y ji ) − x j : In view of ( 22 ) and ( 32 ) we conclude ( ~ y ij + ~ y ji ) = 2 − x j (cid:20) 0 and therefore obtain inductively ! ( T 00 ) (cid:20) ! ( T 0 ) (cid:20) 0 : Conversely , if ( 32 ) is violated at some node r 2 V ( i : e : , x r = 0 and ~ y lr = 1 for some l 2 V ) , we take T to a star with center r and l as one of its b leaves . Then ! ( T ) > 0 holds . 5 . Computational Results We implemented a branch - and - bound algorithm for the edge - weighted clique problem ( W CP b ) as follows . At each node of the search tree , we create subproblems by (cid:12)xing some variable x i to either 0 or 1 . Following an idea of Lucena [ 1992 ] , we compute upper bounds for the objective function of the subproblems by (cid:12)rst ( approximately ) solving the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem ( D ) min f L ( u ; w ) j u (cid:21) 0 g 16 MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN and then adding new violated inequalities to the objective function of the Lagrangian problem . We then solve the Lagrangian dual problem relative to the new objective function and add new violated inequalities . We repeat this process a (cid:12)xed number of times . In the following , we will refer to an execution of this process ( i : e : , solving problem ( D ) and adding new violated inequalities ) as a cycle . In order to keep the number of dualized constraints manageable , we re - move in each cycle those constraints from the objective function for which the associated Lagrangian multipliers are almost 0 . We solve the Lagrangian dual ( D ) via the subgradient method with step sizes either according Held et al . [ 1974 ] with (cid:21) k = (cid:26)f ( x k ) − (cid:22) f k γ k k ; ( 33 ) where (cid:22) f is an estimation of the optimal value f (cid:3) , and coe(cid:14)cient (cid:26) satis(cid:12)es 0 < (cid:26) (cid:20) 2 or according to the convergent series method ( see Shor [ 1968 ] and Go(cid:14)n [ 1977 ] ) with (cid:21) k = (cid:21) 0 (cid:11) k ; ( 34 ) where 0 < (cid:11) < 1 , and (cid:21) 0 is the initial step size . Several preliminary tests lead us to an implementation where we use the (cid:12)rst rule for solving Lagrangian dual problems associated to node 0 of the search tree and use the convergent series method for search tree nodes at depth > 0 . As to the parameter setting , we observed that the correct choice of param - eters depends on the type of inequalities we add . For example , the \ original " Lagrangian dual ( D ) could be solved with the convergent series method and (cid:11) = 0 : 95 , while we needed (cid:11) = 0 : 99 when we added all triangle clique and cut inequalities . Such high values of (cid:11) ( we set (cid:21) 0 = 100 ) lead to a fairly large number of iterations ( about 300 ) of the subgradient method . All of our computational results are obtained with a (cid:12)xed setting of the parameters , chosen so as to optimize running times for the \ hard instances " . We noticed that the choice of a di(cid:11)erent setting could result in a faster solution for the \ easy " problems . Lower bounds are computed with a simple heuristic solution algorithm proposed by Sp¨ath [ 1985a ] : we take the clique given a the current solution and perform a sequence of simple exchange steps ( exchange a node in the clique with a node outside ) until a local maximum is reached . This heuristic performed extremely well : in all of our experiments , we found the global optimum before the (cid:12)rst branching , i : e : , at depth 0 . THE EDGE - WEIGHTED CLIQUE PROBLEM 17 Macambira and de Souza [ 1996 ] tested a branch - and - cut method on a set of instances with 40 (cid:20) n (cid:20) 48 and b = n = 2 . Edge weights were generated by using a parameter k 2 f 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 g . Our computational results for these instances are listed below in Table 1 ( positive edge weights ) and Table 2 ( mixed , i : e : , positive and negative edge weights ) . The column \ gap % " displays the relative di(cid:11)erence between the optimal solution and the upper bound computed at depth 0 . The columns \ max depth " and \ # branch nodes " refer to the search tree . The running time resulting from our approach seems to be at least com - parable with the branch - and - cut method of Macambira and de Souza [ 1996 ] . On the hard instances , in particular , our approach led to an improvement by a factor of 2 or 3 . Our computations were carried out on a HP 9000 / 735 ( 125 Mhz ) , whereas Macambira and de Souza implemented their algorithm on a SUN Sparc 1000 machine , using CPLEX 3 . 0 . 18 MARCEL HUNTING , ULRICH FAIGLE , AND WALTER KERN optimal gap max . # branch time n k value 1st node % depth nodes ( sec . ) 1 109346 109819 . 2 0 . 4 4 11 1677 2 82451 82517 . 1 0 . 1 2 5 946 40 3 68759 69339 . 4 0 . 8 5 23 2115 4 60782 61601 . 3 1 . 3 5 37 2915 5 60513 60561 . 7 0 . 1 1 3 917 1 120299 121308 . 0 0 . 8 5 43 3845 2 87810 88950 . 6 1 . 3 6 47 4203 42 3 76554 77081 . 3 0 . 7 11 39 3947 4 69482 69644 . 5 0 . 2 2 7 1381 5 67383 67453 . 5 0 . 1 1 3 1245 1 136525 136846 . 5 0 . 2 4 11 1912 2 98186 99285 . 3 1 . 1 4 31 3672 44 3 84675 84856 . 6 0 . 2 2 7 1332 4 75274 75559 . 8 0 . 4 2 7 1403 5 69540 69777 . 6 0 . 3 12 27 4113 1 142985 144377 . 5 1 . 0 7 57 5590 2 108243 109777 . 5 1 . 4 6 81 7481 46 3 94859 95213 . 7 0 . 4 4 15 2421 4 78747 79674 . 4 1 . 2 5 41 4222 5 72431 73297 . 8 1 . 2 8 43 4434 1 163397 164435 . 4 0 . 6 6 47 4959 2 115471 118219 . 7 2 . 4 11 295 27479 48 3 96666 98305 . 9 1 . 7 8 117 11166 4 88728 89112 . 5 0 . 4 4 11 2122 5 82117 82361 . 6 0 . 3 4 9 2093 Table 1 .
