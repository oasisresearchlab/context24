ABSTRACT We report further characterization of the physical and immunologic properties , mechanism of action , and intracellular localization of Acanthamoeba castellanii capping pro - tein , an actin regulatory protein discovered by Isenberg ( Isenberg , G . , U . Aebi , and T . D . Pollard , 1980 , Nature ( Lond . ) 288 : 455 - 459 ) . The native molecular weight calculated from measurements of Stokes ' radius ( 3 . 8 nm by gel filtration chromatography ) and sedimentation coefficient ( 4 . 8 S by sucrose gradient velocity sedimentation ) was 74 , 000 daltons . The subunit molecular weights were 31 , 000 and 28 , 000 daltons , so the native molecule is a heterodimer . The two subunits did not immunologically cross - react with each other or with any other proteins from Acanthamoeba or several other organisms . In studies of the mechanism of action , Isenberg ( see above reference ) found that capping protein blocked polymerization from the barbed end of actin filaments and sedimented with actin filaments . We confirmed that capping protein binds to actin filaments with a gel filtration assay . Capping protein decreased the length distribution and high shear viscosity of actin filaments . Capping protein did not bundle or cross - link actin filaments . Low concentrations of capping protein increased the critical concentration for muscle and ameba actin polymeriza - tion from 0 . 1 to 0 . 6 AM in Mg ` and EGTA . Increasing amounts of capping protein did not increase the critical concentration further . In Ca " capping protein did not change the critical concentration for muscle actin , but did increase the critical concentration for ameba actin . Ca " had no effect on the ability of capping protein to decrease the low or high shear viscosity of actin filaments . By indirect fluorescent antiboldy staining , capping protein was localized to the cell cortex , an area rich in actin filaments . During subcellular fractionation of homogenates , about 1 / 3 of cellular capping protein banded with a crude membrane fraction . The other z / 3 of cellular capping protein was soluble , with a Stokes ' radius equal to that of the purified protein . The molar ratio of capping protein to actin in the cell was 1 : 150 . MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard ( 28 ) observed a novel activity : a decrease in low shear viscosity of actin filaments in chro - matographic profiles ofextracts of Acanthamoeba castellanii . Using the falling ball viscometer to measure this activity , Isenberg et al . ( 23 ) purified a protein , which was called cap - ping protein because of its ability to inhibit the addition of monomers to the barbed end of actin filaments , and thus capping the ends . Proteins from various sources with similar activity have also been purified ( 19 , 47 , 14 , 8 , 21 , 33 , 25 , 46 ; THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 99 JULY 1984 217 - 225 0 The Rockefeller University Press - 0021 - 9525 / 84 / 07 / 0217 / 09 $ 1 . 00 for a review see reference 13 ) . Available evidence indicates that all these proteins resemble cytochalasin in their ability to cap the barbed end ofactin filaments ( 9 , 7 , 27 , 29 ) . There are important structural and functional differences among these proteins , however . The molecular weights , subunit composi - tion , and immunologic cross - reactivity are similar for some proteins , especially those from different mammalian tissues , but different for others , especially from evolutionarily distant species . Some are sensitive to calcium , and some have other 217 activities , such as filament bundling , filament shortening , and nucleation of polymerization , which may or may not be explained by the interaction of a protein with barbed ends of filaments . We report our continued studies of the properties and mechanism of action of capping protein from Acantham - oeba . The functional significance of these proteins in cells is also uncertain . The effect of these proteins on the length of fila - ments and on the low shear viscosity of filament networks has led to speculation that they may regulate locally the rheological properties of cytoplasm . The binding of the pro - teins to barbed ends has led to speculation that they may anchor actin filaments to various cell structures , such as membranes . Their ability to promote the nucleation of actin filaments has suggested that they may locally control the number ofactin filaments in the cytoplasm , and their ability to bundle actin filaments has suggested a role in the formation and structure of actin filament bundles , such as those found in intestinal microvilli . The exact role of a protein in vivo is a difficult question that we have approached with two exper - iments . First , we localized capping protein in cells using fluorescent antibodies , and second , we examined the subcel - lular fractionation of capping protein . Some of these results were presented in preliminary form at the 1981 and 1982 meetings of the American Society for Cell Biology ( 11 , 41 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Except as noted below , chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St .

( 24 ) . 21 8 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 99 , 1984 Purification and Critical Concentration Measurements of Actin Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle by a modification of the procedure of Spudich and Watt ( 38 ) , with one cycle of polymerization and depolymerization from 0 . 8 M KCI . Conventional actin was chromatographed on Sephadex G150 in buffer A ( 30 ) . Acanthamoeba actin was prepared by the method of Gordon et al . ( 20 ) with two cycles of polymerization and depoly - merization before gel filtration . The preparation and documentation for the use of pyrene - labeled actin has been fully described ( 26 , l2 ) . Pyrene actin had the same polymerization properties as native actin . Fluorescence was measured in a Perkin - Elmer 650 - 10S fluorometer ( Perkin - ElmerCorp . , Norwalk , CT ) with excitation at 365 nm and emissionat 407 rim . Temperature was controlled at 25°C with a circulating water bath . Critical concentration for actin polymerization was measured as the inflec - tion point of fluorescence vs . total actin concentration . A set of samples was prepared with various actin concentrationsand one capping protein concentra - tion . The samples were incubated overnight to allow polymerization to reach steady state , thenfluorescence was measured . The mole fraction ofpyrene actin to total actin varied from 0 . 05 to 0 . 3 . Antibody Preparation Capping protein was reacted with dansyl chloride ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Rockford , IL ) and electrophoresed on 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gels . The individual 28 , 000 and 31 , 000 - dalton bands were sliced from the gel , and the polypeptides were electrophoretically eluted ( 39 ) . Two New Zealand rabbits were immunized with 28 , 000 - dalton polypeptide and one with 31 , 000 - dalton polypeptide , as described by Fujiwara and Pollard ( 17 ) . The rabbits were boosted and bled . ' Immunoglobulins were prepared from serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 37 % followed by DEAE - cellulose chromatography . To prepare affinity - purified antibodies for staining cells , purified capping protein was conjugated to Sepharose 4Bwhich had been activated by cyanogen bromide ( 34 ) . Immunoglobulins were applied to the column in PBS , the column was washed with PBS , and the specific antibodies were eluted with 0 . 1 M glycine pH 2 . 8 . Immunoblots Sample were electrophoresed on 14 % SDS polyacrylamide gels cross - linked with diallyltartardiamide ( 18 ) . The gel was electrophoretically blotted onto nitrocellulose paper ( Schleicher & Schuell , Keene , NH ) ( 40 ) . The paper was incubated with TTX - BSA , antiserum or antibodies diluted in TTX - BSA , and finally ' 251 - Protein A ( 100 , 000 cpm / ml ) . To prepare affinity - purified antibodies for immunoblots , capping protein subunits were separated by SDS PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper . The paper was stained with amido black to visualize the protein , and capping protein subunitbands werecut outofthe paper . Immunoglobulins were applied to the strips of paper , the strips were washed , and specificantibodies were eluted with 0 . 1 M glycine , pH 2 . 8 . Immunoassay for Capping Protein Dr . Daniel Kiehart developed this solid phase binding assay , based on the procedure of Tsu and Herzenberg ( 42 ) . Antigen was diluted with 5 mM imidazole / HCI , pH 7 . 0 , and 50 tel was dried down in a polystyrene microtiter well ( Dynatech Laboratories , Alexandria , VA ) . The wells were rinsedwith PBS , and incubated with 50 tel ofa 100 - fold dilution of rabbit anticapping protein serum in TTX - BSA . The wells were rinsed with TTX - BSA , incubated with 25 Al of " ' I - Protein A ( 1 , 000 cpm / tul ) in TTX - BSA , rinsed again , and counted in a Beckman Gamma 4000 ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . ) . In the subcellular fractionation experiments a more quantitative variation ofthe assay was used . 5 tel ofserial dilutions ofantigen in PBS with 0 . 1 % ( wt / vol ) Triton X - 100 with orwithout 0 . 02 % ( wt / vol ) SDS was appliedto a I x I cm piece ofnitrocellulose paper . The paper was treated with antibodies and " ' I - Protein A as described above . Velocity Sedimentation through Sucrose Gradients 0 . 1 ml of capping protein alone or with enzymes ofknown sedimentation coefficient including catalase , yeast alcohol dehydrogenase , and lysozyme was sedimented through 5 - ml linear 5 - 20 % ( wt / vol ) sucrose gradients at 4°C ( 31 ) . The centrifugation was at 39 , 000 rpm in a Beckman SW50 . 1 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . ) for 18 h . 0 . 1 - ml fractions were collected and analyzed for standards with enzyme assays ( 44 , 4 , 37 ) and for capping protein with an immunoassay . Plots of sedimentation coefficient vs . fraction number were linear for the standards , and the sedimentation coefficient of capping protein was interpolated from this plot . Localization of Capping Protein and Actin Filaments with Fluorescence Microscopy ADHERENCE OF CELLS TO GLASS COVERSLIPs : Glass coverslips were boiled in Alconox and cleaned with ethanol . They were coated with a 0 . 1 % ( wt / vol ) solution of polylysine , washed with water , and allowed to dry . On the day of an experiment these coverslips were treated with 1 % ( wt / vol ) glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Fort Washington , PA ) in water for 30 min and washed with water . Acanthamoeba castellanii were removed from an aerated suspension culture at early log phase density . Cells were washed from their growth medium into 50 mM NaCl , 20 mM Na phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , and resuspended in a small volume ofthe same buffer . Cells in suspension were allowed to settle onto the glutaraldehyde - treated , polylysine - coated coverslips for 60 min . FIXATION AND PERMEABILIZATION : Cells adhering to the cover - slips were fixed with 2 % ( wt / vol ) formaldehyde ( prepared daily from solid paraformaldehyde ) in 50 mM NaCl , 20 mM Na phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , for 10 min at room temperature and washed with the same buffer without formaldehyde . To permeabilize the cells , coverslips were dipped into acetone at - 20°C for 30 s and immediately transferred to 1 mM ethanolamine in Gel - PBS for 5 min , which quenched the formaldehyde . The permeabilized cells were washed with Gel - PBS . ANTIBODY STAINING : (cid:9) Permeabilized cells were incubated with 50 Ag / ml of either affinity - purified rabbit anticapping protein ( 28 , 000 daltons ) or immunoglobulins from preimmune serum from the same rabbit in Gel - PBS for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times with Gel - PBS . We preadsorbed DEAE - purified , rhodamine - labeled , goat anti - rabbit immunoglob - ulins ( Cappel Laboratories , Cochranville , PA ) in a batch procedure with form - aldehyde - fixed , acetone - extracted Acanthamoeba to reduce nonspecific fluores - cence . Cells were incubated with 80 ug / ml of this second antibody for 30 min at room temperature and washed four times for 15 min each with Gel - PBS . Coverslips were mounted on slides with a filter paper support ring . Slideswere viewed and photomicrographs taken with a Leitz fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters and a Zeiss 63 x , 1 . 4 NA Planapochromate phase objective . The shutter was controlled manually for the fluorescence micrographs so that experimental and control exposures were the same . N B D ' - PH A L LACIDI N ST A I NIN G : (cid:9) Permeabilized cells were incubated with 0 . 33 uM 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazole ( NBD ) - phallacidin ( Molecular Probes , Junction City , OR ) in Gel - PBS for 15 min . Cells were washed with Gel - PBS , and coverslips were mounted and viewed with filters appropriate for fluorescein fluorescence . Subcellular Fractionation Acanthamoeba grown in aerated suspension cultures were washed with 50 mM NaCl and homogenized with 1 . 5 vol of 10 % ( wt / vol ) sucrose , 0 . 1 M KCI , 20mM imidazole / HCI , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM EGTA , I mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 0 . 1 mM benzamidine with 10 vigorous strokes ofa tight - fittingDounce homogenizeron ice . The homogenate was centrifuged at 2 , 000 g for 5 min to remove whole cells and nuclei . The supernatant was centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 90 min in a Beckman Ti 42 . 1 rotor ( Beckman Institutes , Inc . ) to pellet membranes . The pellet was suspended in homogenization buffer and layered on top of a 30 - ml linear gradient of 30 to 65 % ( wt / vol ) sucrose in 0 . 1 M KCI , 20 mM imidazole / HCI , pH 7 . 0 , and 0 . 01 % ( wt / vol ) NaN , . The tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 27 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . ) at 25 , 000 rpm for 18 h . 2 - ml fractions were collected and analyzed for protein ( 6 ) capping protein with the immunoassay , 5 ' - nucleotidase ( 45 ) and ß - N - acetyl glucosaminidase ( 22 ) . Protein Determination Protein was measured by the method of Bradford ( 6 ) with egg albumin as standard . ' Abbreviation used in this paper . NBD ; 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - dia - zole . RESULTS Purification of Capping Protein The purification of capping protein was followed by a functional assay , decrease of the low shear viscosity of actin filaments ( Fig . 1 ) , an immunoassay using specific antiserum against the 28 , 000 and 31 , 000 - dalton polypeptides ( Fig . 1 ) , and SDS PAGE ( Fig . 2 ) . The functional activity coincided with the immunoassay in the several chromatography steps employed ( Fig . 1 ) . Acanthamoeba were grown in aerated suspension cultures , homogenized , and centrifuged , and the supernatant was chro - matographed on DEAE - cellulose ( Fig . 1 A ) essentially as de - scribed by Maruta et al . ( 32 ) . Fractions containing activity were pooled , concentrated fivefold by dialysis against dry sucrose , and chromatographed on Sephacryl S - 300 ( Fig . 1 B ) . The peak fractions were pooled and chromatographed on hydroxylapatite with a concave 0 - 0 . 2 M phosphate gradient ( Fig . 1 C ) . The peak fractions were pooled and chromato - graphed on phosphocellulose with a linear 0 - 0 . 3 M KCI gradient ( Fig . 1 D ) . This procedure was modified in several ways from the previous one ( 23 ) . Changes included homoge - nization conditions , DEAE conditions , absence of ammo - nium sulfate precipitation , Sephacryl S - 300 instead of Seph - adex G - 150 , and addition of phosphocellulose chromatogra - phy . These changes , notably phosphocellulose chromatogra - phy , improved both the purity and yield of the capping protein . The polypeptide composition of pools from a successful preparation is shown in Fig . 2 . In this case , the final material contained only the two capping protein bands and a trace amount of proteolytic fragment of the 28 , 000 - dalton band with a mobility of 27 , 000 daltons . The final material from a different successful preparation is shown in Fig . 3 , lane f . Only the two capping protein bands were present in this preparation . A plot ofthe log ofmolecularweight vs . mobility of the standards , excluding the 200 , 000 - dalton standard , was linear . By interpolation from this plot the molecular weights of the capping protein subunits were 28 , 000 and 31 , 000 daltons . The error was estimated to be ± 2 , 000 based on the scatter of the standard points away from the line . No other bands were detected on SDS polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue loaded with up to 50 Ng of protein . Experi - ments were performed with material of this quality . The average yield was - 1 mg of pure protein from 500 g of wet packed cells . The pure material had an Ezs° o of 8 based on the Bradford protein assay . For unknown reasons , preparations often yielded material of less purity ( about - 20 to 80 % capping protein ) , but this material was not used for experi - ments . Physical Properties The Stokes ' radius ofcapping protein was 3 . 8 nm from the partition coefficient on Sephacryl S - 300 . Five proteins of known Stokes ' radius were chromatographed , and the Stokes ' radius of capping protein was calculated ( 1 ) . The sedimenta - tion coefficient of capping protein was 4 . 8 S by velocity sedimentation through a sucrose gradient ( 31 ) . From these two measurements , the native molecular weight was calcu - lated using the Svedberg equation , assuming that ( a ) partial specific volume was 0 . 72 cm ' / g , ( b ) density was 1 . 0 g / cm3 , and ( c ) viscosity was 0 . 01 poise .

Half of the proteose peptone in the culture medium was replaced with yeast extract ( Difco Laborato - ries , Inc . , Detroit , MI ) . About 700 g of wet packed cells was homogenized with 2 vol of 75 mM KCI , 12 mM Na pyrophos - phate , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 30 mM imidazole / HCI , pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluo - ride , 0 . 1 mM benzamidine in a Dounce homogenizer on ice . The homogenate was spun in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 40 , 000 rpm for 70 min . The supernatant solution was adjusted to pH 8 . 0 with 1 M Tris and dialyzed over - night against 20 vol of 7 . 5 mM Na pyrophosphate , 0 . 5 mM di - thiothreitol , 10 mM Tris / HCI , pH 8 . 0 .

The pool from the hydroxylapatite column was dialyzed against 10 mM Na succinate , pH 5 . 5 , and applied to a 2 by 10 - cm column of phosphocellulose ( P11 , Whatman Chemical Separation , Inc . ) equilibrated with the same buffer . The column was eluted with a 200 - ml linear gradient to 0 . 25 M KCI .

The native molecule is most likely a heterodimer of the two subunits . The ratio of the fractional coefficient to that expected for an anhydrous sphere ( f / fo ) was calculated to be 1 . 38 from these data . Capping protein was soluble at pH 5 . 0 and precipitated at pH 3 . 5 . In immunoblot experiments on whole cell proteins and pure capping protein , affinity - purified antibodies to the 28 , 000 - dalton polypeptide reacted only with a 28 , 000 - dalton band . Similarly , affinity - purified antibodies to the 31 , 000 - dalton polypeptide reacted only with a 31 , 000 - dalton band ( Fig . 3 ) . The mobility ofthe bands was the same in the whole cell and capping protein samples . Neitherantibody recognized any protein of another molecular weight in Acanthamoeba ( Fig . 3 ) . Neither antiserum recognized any protein in Astro - nixus , Physarum , Drosophila , PTK cells , or chicken heart , gizzard , breast muscle , or anterior latissimus dorsi muscle . Dr . Gerhard Isenberg , working in our laboratory , found that neither antiserum recognized any protein in Dictyoslelium , sea urchin eggs , or calf brain . Capping Protein Binding to Actin Filaments Binding of capping protein to Acanthamoeba actin fila - ments was detected by gel filtration ( Fig . 4 ) . Actin filaments eluted at the void volume . Capping protein alone eluted at FIGURE 2 (cid:9) SDS PAGE of capping protein pools at each step in the preparation . The lanes are as follows : ( a ) high speed supernatant of homogenate ; ( b ) DEAE column pool ; ( c ) S - 300 column pool ; ( d ) hydroxylapatite column pool ; ( e ) phosphocellulose column pool .

DF , dye front . the back of the column profile , near the total volume . When actin filaments and capping protein were mixed together , some capping protein , measured by immunoassay , eluted at the void volume with the actin filaments . Since actin has a low affinity for immunoglobulins ( 16 ) , we confirmed that the immunoreactive material in the void volume was capping protein by immunoblots of the fractions . Similar results were obtained with muscle actin . Effect of Capping Protein on Actin Filament Length and High Shear Viscosity Muscle actin filaments polymerized in the presence of capping protein were shorter and had a lower high shear viscosity than filaments polymerized in the absence ofcapping protein ( Table I ) . The activity was observed in the presence and absence of Ca " . No filament bundles were observed by electron microscopy of samples of actin filaments with cap - ping protein .

Capping protein eluted at the void volume ( V ) , with actin filaments , as well as at its usual position near the total volume ( V ) . The column was a 19 by 0 . 9 - cm column of Sephacryl S - 500 with a total volume of 13 . 5 ml ( deter - mined from the elution position of ' H20 ) . The buffer was 0 . 1 M KCI , 2 MM MgCl2 , 10 mM imidazole / HCI , pH 7 . 0 . The fractions were 1 ml . The sample was 1 ml of 28 AM ameba actin and 1 pM capping protein in the column buffer plus 60 % ( vol / vol ) buffer A . Most of the absorbance peak near the total volume was due to ATP which was present in the sample , but not in the column buffer . from 0 . 1 to 0 . 6 AM ( Table II ) . With increasing concentrations ofcapping protein , the critical concentration did not increase further . In the presence ofCa " , capping protein had no effect on the critical concentration of muscle actin but increased the critical concentration of ameba actin from 1 . 2 to 1 . 6 AM . In these experiments critical concentration was determined as the inflection point of a plot of fluorescence from pyrene actin vs . total actin concentration . Capping protein did not change the slope of either the monomer or polymer phases of these plots . VR à 1 0 COOPER ET AL .

Effect of Capping Protein on Low Shear Viscosity Capping protein decreased the low shear viscosity of both muscle and ameba actin with a similar but not identical concentration dependence in the presence and absence of Ca " ( Fig . 5 ) . In this experiment capping protein was present at the start of actin polymerization . Capping protein had a similar effect when mixed with preformed filaments . Localization of Capping Protein and Actin Filaments in Cells Actin filaments were localized in fixed and permeabilized Acanthamoeba using NBD - phallacidin , a specific probe for actin filaments ( 3 ) ( Fig . 6a ) . Fluorescence was most intense over the hyaline ectoplasm , a peripheral portion of the cyto - 222 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 99 , 1984 C P (cid:9) Dilution FIGURE 5 (cid:9) Effect of capping protein on low shear viscosity of Acan - thamoeba ( circles ) and rabbit skeletal muscle ( squares ) actin .

Filopodia , which contain actin filament bundles by electron microscopy ( 36 ) , were also flu - orescent . Indirect fluorescent antibody staining with specific affinity - purified rabbit antibodies against the 28 , 000 - dalton subunit gave a pattern of fluorescence ( Fig . 6 c ) similarto that observed with NBD - phallacidin ( Fig . 6a ) . The hyaline ectoplasm and filopodia were more fluorescent than the rest of the cell . High concentrations of affinity - purified anticapping protein were required to observe specific fluorescent staining . These high concentrations , perhaps necessitated by the low concentration of capping protein present in cells , were responsible for some nonspecific staining ofcentral cytoplasm and certain vacuoles . Subcellular Fractionation of Capping Protein A standard subcellular fractionation procedure was applied to Acanthamoeba to determine if any capping protein was associated with membranes , specifically the plasma mem - brane . Using a more quantitative variation of the immunoas - say for capping protein , we found that about ' / 3 of total cell capping protein pelletted in a high speed centrifugation . Gel filtration of the supernatant on Sephacryl S - 300 showed that capping protein , detected by immunoassay , had a partition coefficient of 0 . 417 . Pure capping protein had a partition coefficient of 0 . 414 on the same column . This centrifugation pelletted membranes and should have pelletted long actin filaments . Sucrose density gradient analysis of the membrane pellet showed that capping protein sedimented to a density identical to that of 5 ' - nucleotidase , a plasma membrane marker ( 43 ) . Free protein would not have sedimented to this position . This marker was , however , not well separated from the peak of beta - N - acetyl glucosaminidase , a lysosomel marker , and the major protein peak . Electron microscopy of thin sections ofmaterial at this density revealed mitochondria , closed vesicles that were probably lysosomes , and closed and TABLE I I T I I I I I Effect of Capping Protein on Actin Filament Length and High 100 _ O " Shear Viscosity . 0 80 0 \ Filament Total ó Filament - number Mean No . of 60 w O Capping reduced concen - filament counted ó \ O 1 Divalent cation protein viscosity tration length ends c 40 nM mlfmg nM Um 0V 20 r 2 mM MgC12 0 1 . 09 1 . 1 10 . 0 38 I 0 I > t t f - - ßs . - ~ - _ 1 mM EGTA 7 1 . 02 5 . 4 1 . 6 500 0 258 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 protein nM Actin Muscle Muscle Ameba Muscle Muscle Ameba 0 0 . 12 0 . 13 0 . 12 0 . 78 0 . 77 1 . 2 7 0 . 55 0 . 66 0 . 72 0 . 78 0 . 86 1 . 8 40 0 . 60 0 . 67 0 . 66 0 . 76 0 . 84 1 . 6 260 0 . 61 0 . 65 0 . 66 0 . 77 0 . 82 1 . 6 FIGURr 6 (cid:9) Localization of actin filaments with NBD - phallacidin and capping protein with fluorescent antibodies . Pairs of phase contrast and fluorescence micrographs are shown . ( a ) NBD - phallacidin . The hyaline ectoplasm , an area of the cell under the plasma membrane which is devoid of granules by phase microscopy , is intensely fluorescent . Filopodia , spikelike projections from the cell surface , are also stained ( inset ) . Fluorescence is also observed throughout open membrane sheets some of which were associated with - thin filaments and amorphous material ( data not shown ) . Measurement of Total Cell Capping Protein Immunoblots were used to estimate the total amount of capping protein in cells . Various dilutions of whole cells and capping protein were electrophoresed in different lanes ofone SDS polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper . The paper was treated with anticapping protein antibodies and " ' I - Protein A . The intensity of the bands on an autora - diogram were compared to determine which dilution ofwhole cells corresponded to which amount of capping protein . In two separate experiments 1 g of wet packed cells contained 120 jAg of capping protein . Since 1 g of wet packed cells contained 100 mg of protein by the Bradford assay , capping protein represented - 0 . 1 % of total cell protein . This mea - surement shows that the yield of the purification procedure was - 4 % of the total capping protein . In data presented by Gordon et al . ( 20 ) , actin represented - 10 % of total cell protein , based on the Coomassie Blue stain associated with the 42 , 000 - dalton peak on an SDS - polyacrylamide gel of a whole cell sample . Therefore we estimate that the molar ratio of actin to capping protein in whole cells was - 150 to 1 . DISCUSSION Mechanism of Action The previous work on Acanthamoeba capping protein ( 23 ) suggested that capping protein inhibited the addition of actin monomers to the barbed end ofactin filaments by binding to that end . The new observations reported here support this mechanism . First , we asked whether capping protein bound to actin filaments . In rapid gel filtration of a mixture of capping protein with actin , capping protein eluted in the void volume with actin filaments instead of in its usual position near the back of the profile . Therefore , capping protein either bound to the filaments or formed some other large complex with actin . The exclusion limit of the chromatography material was - 22 nm , based on the results of Davis and Bennett ( 15 ) . In this experiment not all of the capping protein eluted in the void volume , and in our initial experiments with longer columns and lower flow rates , there was no capping protein in the void volume . Our interpretation is that the affinity constant for binding was low enough that the complex fell apart as it moved down the column . Unfortunately , quanti - tative measurement of binding constants is not possible with this type of experiment ( 1 ) . Second , capping protein lowered the length distribution and , as a consequence , the high shear viscosity of actin the central cytoplasm but not in vacuoles or the nucleus . ( b ) A control where NBD - phallacidin was incubated with actin filaments , the filaments were sedimented , and cells were stained with the supernatant . No fluorescence was observed . In another control ( not shown ) excess phalloidin 0OpM ) was added to the NBD - phallacidin ( 0 . 33 MM ) before staining cells . No fluorescence was observed . ( c ) Anti - capping protein antibodies . The hyaline ectoplasm is intensely fluorescent . The central cytoplasm and certain vacuoles are mildly fluorescent , but these regions are also lightly stained in a control experiment ( d ) with preimmune immunoglobulins in place of anti - capping protein . The nucleus and most cytoplasmic vacuoles are not fluorescent . Bar , 10 Am . COOPER ET AL . (cid:9) Capping Protein (cid:9) 223 filaments . At low capping protein concentrations the number concentration of filaments was similar to the concentration of capping protein . The filament length distribution at equi - librium is a complex function of the rates of nucleation , fragmentation , and annealing . Unfortunately , there is no mathematical method to quantitatively relate the filament length distribution with the capping of ends . A shorter fila - ment length distribution might be caused by an increased nucleation rate , increased fragmentation rate , or decreased annealing rate . Although these experiments do not distinguish among these possibilities , a decrease of the annealing rate could be caused by the binding of capping protein to barbed ends of filaments . Third , capping protein increased the critical concentration for actin polymerization . Two specific characteristics of this increase support the capping mechanism . In Mg ` and EGTA the critical concentration for muscle and ameba actin in - creased from 0 . 1 to 0 . 6 AM but not above 0 . 6 AM when more capping protein was added . This feature rules out a mecha - nism where capping protein acts as a monomer - binding pro - tein . The values of the critical concentrations are those pre - dicted by assuming that capping protein prevents monomer association and dissociation at the barbed end of actin fila - ments . Bonder et al . ( 5 ) found that in Mg ` and EGTA the critical concentrations at the barbed and pointed ends were 0 . 1 and 0 . 6 AM , respectively . The critical concentration in the absence of capping protein ( 0 . 1 AM ) should be near that of the barbed end ( 0 . 1 AM ) since the rate constants are much higher at the barbed than at the pointed end . The critical concentration in the presence of capping protein ( 0 . 6 AM ) should be that ofthe pointed end ( 0 . 1 AM ) ifcapping protein prevents both monomer addition and loss at the barbed end . Bonder et al . ( 5 ) found that the critical concentrations were the same at the two ends for muscle actin in the presence of Ca " , and accordingly in our experiments capping protein did not increase the critical concentration for muscle actin in Ca " . Capping protein did increase the critical concentration for ameba actin in Ca " . In Ca " the critical concentration and polymerization kinetics of Acanthamoeba actin are dif - ferent from those of muscle actin , so this difference is not surprising . In the original report on capping protein ( 23 ) , capping protein was observed to decrease the amount of actin that sedimented in an ultracentrifugation experiment . This result was interpreted to mean that capping protein increased the critical concentration to 3 . 2 AM . This experiment gave similar results with the pure material described here , but in light of our critical concentration measurements , capping protein must have caused less actin to sediment by making shorter filaments instead of more monomers . The supernatant from such an experiment did contain short filaments observed by electron microscopy . Experiments with Cells These experiments with pure proteins have shown that capping protein can bind to the barbed end ofactin filaments and decrease the filament length distribution . These results suggest that capping protein may function in cells to bind actin filaments via their barbed ends to a structure , such as the plasma membrane , and control the number and length of actin filaments that might affect cytoplasmic structure and cell motility . As a first step in the investigation of the role of capping protein in cells , we localized capping protein in cells 224 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 99 , 1984 and examined its subcellular fractionation properties . Cap - ping protein was localized primarily to the hyaline ectoplasm , a region of the cytoplasm just under the plasma membrane that contains a high concentration ofactin filaments . Another Acanthamoeba actin filament binding protein , gelation pro - tein , was also concentrated in the hyaline ectoplasm ( 41 ) . In subcellular fractionation , 1 / s ofcapping protein was associated with a crude membrane fraction that included plasma mem - branes . These experiments show that capping protein is as - sociated with a region of cells rich in actin filaments and with a membrane fraction , which itself contains actin filaments . The total amount of capping protein in cells was measured . The molar ratio of capping protein to actin is roughly 1 to 150 , which is about one capping protein per 0 . 4 Am actin filament . Some capping protein in cells is probably not associated with filaments . In the fractionation experiment , long actin filaments should have sedimented in the high speed centrifu - gation , but z / s of capping protein did not sediment . Capping protein in this crude supernatant was not in a stable complex , based on its elution from a gel filtration column . This amount of capping protein is probably not all free in cells because capping protein bound to short actin filaments , would have dissociated in the column , and , of course , the conditions chosen to disrupt the cells may not have been physiologic in key details . In conclusion , the mechanism of actin of capping protein on actin in vitro has become more clear , but the effect of capping protein on actin in cells and the physiologic impor - tance of this activity is unknown and remains to be investi - gated . Physical Properties and Subunit Composition Acanthamoeba capping protein was discovered as an activ - ity that decreased the low shear viscosity of actin filaments . Purification of this activity yielded a preparation containing only two polypeptides with molecular weights of 28 , 000 and 31 , 000 by SDS PAGE . The Stokes ' radius ( 3 . 8 nm ) and sedimentation coefficient ( 4 . 8 S ) indicate that capping protein has a native molecular weight of 74 , 000 daltons . Therefore the native molecule is most likely a heterodimer with subunits of 28 , 000 and 31 , 000 daltons . The discrepancy of 15 , 000 daltons may be due to an error in one of the assumptions or techniques . The sucrose gradient technique for the determi - nation of the sedimentation coefficient was only demon - strated to be accurate for globular enzymes ( 31 ) . The value for partial specific volume was assumed , not measured . Error in the measurement of the subunit molecular weights was ± 2 , 000 daltons . In any event , there was no evidence for another subunit oflow molecular weight . The two subunits are prob - ably different gene products since specific polyclonal antibod - ies against the individual subunits demonstrated no cross - reactivity between them . Comparison with Similar Proteins from Other Systems Proteins from other organisms with activity similar to cap - ping protein generally have higher molecular weights than capping protein . We considered that the capping protein subunits might be proteolytic fragments of a larger molecule similar to the protein from other sources . However , anti - capping protein antibodies did not recognize any protein of higher molecularweight in Acanthamoeba . Also , anti - capping protein antibodies did not recognize any protein in whole cell sample of several other organisms . Some proteins with activ - ities similar to that ofcappingprotein are sensitive to calcium ( 19 , 47 , 14 , 8 , 21 , 33 , 46 ) . The activity of capping protein to decrease the low and high shear viscosity of actin filaments was not sensitive to calcium . Capping protein from bovine brain ( 25 ) is similar to Acanthamoeba capping protein in its subunit stoichiometry and molecular weights and its lack of sensitivity to calcium . Dr .
