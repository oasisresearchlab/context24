For this reason , we decide to describe preliminary data showing the prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG in children with known household exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 . Our report shows that household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is high in both adults and children , with similar rates of SARS - CoV - 2 IgG in all age groups , including the younger children . A total of 44 out of 80 household contacts ( 55 % ) of index patients had anti SARS - CoV - 2 IgG . In particular , 16 ( 59 , 26 % ) adult partners had IgG antibodies compared with 28 ( 52 , 83 % ) of pediatric contacts ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Among the pediatric population , children & # 8805 ; 5 years of age had similar probability of having SARS - CoV - 2 IgG ( 21 / 39 , 53 . 8 % ) compared with those < 5 years ( 7 / 14 , 50 % ) ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Adult partners and children also had a probability of having SARS - CoV - 2 IgG . Interestingly , 35 . 7 % of children and 33 . 3 % of adults with SARS - CoV - 2 IgG were previously diagnosed as COVID - 19 cases . Since this evidence of high rate of IgG in children exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 has public health implication , with this comment we highlight the need of establishing appropriate guidelines for school opening and other social activities related to childhood . .

A much - debated aspect of the disease concerns its impact on children . The study of the prevalence and contagiousness of the disease among children produced conflicting results : on the one hand , low infection rates among children ( 1 ) and a low number of serious diseases ( 2 ) have been described , on the other hand , a serious , albeit rare , inflammatory complication has been reported ( 3 ) . Similarly , on the one hand , low infectiousness rates in the school environment have been described ( 4 ) , while a recent published data highlighted an easy spread of the disease among children in a summer camp ( 5 ) . This is of particular concern as the return to school is one of the most critical steps to be addressed in phase two of the pandemic . To better characterize the possibility of children to be infected with the novel coronavirus , we studied the prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG in children with known household exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 , and to compare this data with adult partners exposed to the same index case ( supplementary material for more methodological details ) ( 6 , 7 ) . The full study is still ongoing , aiming to evaluate the presence of neutralizing antibodies in adults and children exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 and to prospectively follow - up these families in order to understand if a specific antibody pattern protects from further infection . Of 405 adults with COVID - 19 evaluated in the outpatient post COVID unit , 33 were living with children younger than 18 years of age . Of those , 30 ( 90 . 9 % ) agreed to participate and were considered index cases . At the time of COVID - 19 diagnosis of the index case , a total of 80 household contacts were living in the same household and were enrolled in the study of which 53 were children and 27 adult partners ( figure 1 ) . Anti SARS - CoV - 2 IgG were present in 44 ( 55 % ) household contacts of which 16 ( 59 , 26 % ) were adult partners and 28 ( 52 , 83 % ) were pediatric contacts ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Similar relative frequencies of seropositivity where present in children ≥ 5 years of age ( 21 / 39 , 53 . 8 % ) and those < 5 years ( 7 / 14 , 50 % ) ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Adult partners and children also had a similar relative frequency of having SARS - CoV - 2 IgG . Interestingly , ten children ( 35 . 7 % ) and five adults ( 33 . 3 % ) adults with SARS - CoV - 2 IgG reported a history of diagnosis of COVID - 19 . .

SARS - CoV - 2 infection rate was higher in our cohort compared with a large contact tracing study performed in South Korea ( 8 ) . This difference could be related to the study design involving serology . Importantly , more of the 60 % of the household contacts we evaluated , including children , were not diagnosed SARS - CoV - 2 infection before this study probably because most of them did not develop symptoms and were not tested with nasopharyngeal swabs . This strongly suggests that the real burden of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , in particular the pediatric cases , is hugely underestimated ( 9 , 10 ) . Our findings have public health implications , since highlight that children of all age groups have high probability of being infected with SARS - CoV - 2 if closely exposed to an index case . Considering that recent studies suggested that children can have similar ( or even higher ) viral loads than adults on nasopharyngeal swabs , even if asymptomatic ( 11 ) , our study further supports the importance of the need of appropriate procedural guidelines of childhood activities , including schools , in the time of COVID - 19 . Although access to school is a priority right of children with several benefits on all aspects of child development , the growing evidences that children can easily being infected with SARS - CoV - 2 and contribute to virus spread should be used to implement public health recommendations , including hand and respiratory hygiene , physical distancing , masking and active surveillance to reduce and / or prevent of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within childhood environments .
