Using video - enhanced , dual - colour , live fluorescence microscopy , we show the uptake of individual virus particles in CV - 1 cells . After associating with cave - olae , SV40 leaves the plasma membrane in small , caveolin - 1 - containing vesicles . It then enters larger , peripheral organelles with a non - acidic pH . Although rich in caveolin - 1 , these organelles do not contain markers for endo - somes , lysosomes , ER or Golgi , nor do they acquire ligands of clathrin - coated vesicle endocytosis . After several hours in these organelles , SV40 is sorted into tubular , caveolin - free membrane vesicles that move rapidly along microtubules , and is deposited in perinuclear , syntaxin 17 - positive , smooth ER organelles . The microtubule - disrupt - ing agent nocodazole inhibits formation and transport of these tubular carriers , and blocks viral infection . Our results demonstrate the existence of a two - step transport pathway from plasma - membrane caveolae , through an intermediate organelle ( termed the caveosome ) , to the ER . This pathway bypasses endosomes and the Golgi com - plex , and is part of the productive infectious route used by SV40 . M any animal viruses take advantage of receptor - mediated endocytosis to enter their host cells . Typically , they are internalized by clathrin - coated vesicles and penetrate the membrane in endosomes through acid - activated processes 1 , 2 . The fact that SV40 , a non - enveloped DNA virus of the papovavirus family , deviates from this pattern was first discovered by electron microscopy 3 – 5 . On the cell surface , virions were found to be trapped in small , tight - fitting invaginations that were later found to repre - sent caveolae 6 – 8 . Virions were then seen in small , non - clathrin - coat - ed vesicles in the cytosol , and after 15 - 30 min were increasingly present within tubular membrane - bound organelles , each of which contained several virus particles 5 . Starting 4 – 6 h after uptake , the virus accumulated in an anastomizing , tubular membrane network associated with the ER , where it remained for a long time 5 , 9 . When a large number of virions was added to cells , these smooth ER net - works expanded in size , reaching several m m in diameter 5 . It is now well established that SV40 uses major histocompatibil - ity complex ( MHC ) class I antigens as its cell - surface receptor , and that the productive infectious pathway involves caveolae . Accordingly , infection is blocked by addition of antibodies against MHC class I antigens 7 , 10 , by administration of cholesterol - depleting drugs that inhibit formation of caveolae 8 , and by expression of dominant negative mutants of caveolin - 3 , a principal protein com - ponent of caveolae 11 . The extent to which caveolae participate in constitutive endocyt - ic processes in the cell is still unclear . However , caveolar internaliza - tion of gold - conjugated albumin , glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol ( GPI ) - anchored folate receptor ( GM1 ) , ganglioside - bound cholera toxin , and GPI - anchored alkaline phosphatase has been report - ed 12 – 15 . From caveolae , gold - conjugated albumin is thought to trav - el to endosomes 16 , cholera toxin through endosomes and the trans - Golgi network to the ER 17 , and alkaline phosphatase through unidentified vesicular structures back to the plasma membrane 15 . Movement of caveolin - 1 from the plasma membrane to intracellu - lar compartments has also been observed after oxidation or deple - tion of cholesterol 18 , 19 . The finding that amino - terminal truncation mutants of caveolin - 3 localize to intracellular vesicles that are dis - tinct from early endosomes indicates the possible presence of a unique , intermediate organelle in membrane - transport processes that involve caveolae 11 . To analyse caveolar endocytosis in living cells , we investigated SV40 internalization using dual - colour , video - enhanced , live microscopy with Texas Red - labelled virus and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged caveolin - 1 and tubulin . Our results show that transport of SV40 from caveolae to the ER involves two distinct phases , and a unique intermediate sorting compartment that is dis - tinct from endosomes , lysosomes and the Golgi complex .

To analyse uptake of SV40 in live cells , we labelled purified virus with Texas Red - X ( TRX – SV40 ) . After repurification , SDS – poly - acrylamide - gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) and fluorography showed that the label was exclusively coupled to the VP1 protein , and absorbance spectra indicated that each virion carried ~ 10 3 mol - ecules of dye ( Fig . 1a ) . The virus preparation was mono - disperse . Plaque assays showed no loss in infectivity with labelled virus in CV - 1 cells , compared with unlabeled virus ( 3 · 10 8 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) per m g of viral protein ) . Using confocal ( data not shown ) or wide - field ( Fig . 1b ) microscopy , the virus suspension was visible as spots of uniform size that probably corresponded to individual virions . The course of early infection was normal , as determined by expression of T - antigen 20 h after addition of virus ( see below ) . As Texas Red staining in cells overlapped exactly with the pattern seen by immunofluorescence using an anti - SV40 poly - clonal antibody , we conclude that the dye did not dissociate from the virus during the course of infection ( data not shown ) . This is consistent with our previous observation that degradation of incoming viral proteins is extremely slow 5 . To visualize the distribution of caveolin - 1 in live cells , we con - structed plasmids encoding enhanced GFP at either the N or the C terminus of canine caveolin - 1 . When cells were transfected , a simi - lar overall distribution of fluorescent caveolin - 1 was observed for both fusion proteins ( see below ) .

Western blotting of these precipitates with anti - GFP antibody ( lanes 3 , 4 ) detected only caveolin - 1 – GFP and GFP . Panel III , high - speed centrifugation of solubilized lysates through a 5 – 50 % sucrose gradient and western blotting against caveolin - 1 ( N20 ) shows that a large part of both caveolin - 1 – GFP and caveolin - 1 are present in higher - mass complexes ( positions of molecu - lar - mass standards in parallel gradients are shown ) . c , Laser - scanning confocal immunofluorescence analysis of CV - 1 cells expressing caveolin - 1 – GFP ( green ) , using a specific antibody against the caveolar form of caveolin - 1 ( N20 ; see Methods ) .

It prevented uptake of SV40 into cells and inhibited expression of T - antigen ( data not shown ) . This confirmed that the N terminus of caveolin is crucial for caveola - mediated uptake processes 11 . We therefore used C - terminally tagged caveolin - 1 ( caveolin - 1 – GFP ) for all subsequent experiments . When viewed in live cells using wide - field microscopy , caveolin - 1 - GFP staining appeared in two distinct patterns . One pattern con - sisted of small , scattered spots on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2a , left and middle panels ) that probably represent individual caveolae ; the other was composed of larger , more brightly stained , intracel - lular organelles scattered through the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2a , right panel ) . We analysed the amount of caveolin - 1 – GFP expression in transfected cells by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of caveolin - 1 ( N20 ) that recognized both endogenous and GFP - tagged caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 2b , panel I ) . Quantification of the bands showed the level of expression of cave - olin - 1 – GFP was ~ 25 % of that of the endogenous protein . As fluo - rescence microscopy showed that ~ 50 % of cells were transfected , we therefore estimated that the amount of expressed caveolin - 1 – GFP in cells was ~ 50 % of that of endogenous caveolin - 1 . High - speed centrifugation of solubilized lysates in sucrose gradients showed that the majority of endogenous and GFP - tagged caveolin - 1 was present as oligomers ( Fig . 2b , panel III ) . Furthermore , immunoprecipitation with an anti - GFP antibody brought down both GFP - tagged and endogenous caveolin - 1 , indicating that they were present as hetero - oligomers ( Fig . 2b , panel II ) . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using the N20 anti - body showed that the overall distribution of caveolin - 1 was not altered by expression of caveolin - 1 – GFP ( Fig . 2c , open arrow - heads ) .

Complete overlap was also observed in intracellular organelles of most cells ( Fig . 2c , enlargements ) . However , in a small fraction of cells that showed particularly high levels of caveolin - 1 - GFP expression , we observed an accompanying perinuclear accumulation of caveolin - 1 – GFP that was not stained by N20 ( Fig . 2c , asterisk ) . Immunofluorescence detection of man - nosidase II showed that it this pattern corresponded to the Golgi complex ( Fig . 2d ) . This indicates that caveolin - 1 – GFP , like endoge - nous caveolin - 1 ( ref . 20 ) , has a different conformation when pres - ent in caveolae and intracellular spots to that in the Golgi complex . We conclude that caveolin - 1 – GFP was not greatly overexpressed in cells , that it was a reliable reporter of caveolin - 1 distribution , and that it was functional . After cell - surface binding , SV40 moves to stationary caveolae in the membrane and is internalized . To investigate the initial stages of virus – cell interaction , we allowed TRX – SV40 to bind to CV - 1 cells at 4 (cid:176) C , at which temperature virus internalization does not occur , as determined by electron microscopy 5 . When the cells were fixed , a characteristic spotty pattern of fluorescence was seen on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3a , left panel ) . Only a few of these TRX – SV40 spots colocalized with caveolin - 1 – GFP , indicating that the majority of virions did not bind directly to caveolae ( Fig . 3a , d TRX – SV40 TRX – SV40 Caveolin - 1 – GFP TRX – SV40 Caveolin - 1 – GFP TRX – SV40 Caveolin - 1 – GFP Before virus addition 2 h after virus addition Caveolin - 1 – GFP TRX – SV40 TRX – SV40 BODIPY - FL – transferin TRX – SV40 FLX – SFV TRX – SV40 Anti - EEA1 TRX – SV40 Anti - TGN46 TRX – SV40 FITC – dextran a 1 h 2 h c b Figure 4 SV40 enters caveosomes , which are intermediate organelles in caveolar uptake . a , Left panel , live fluorescence analysis of internalized TRX – SV40 ( red ) in non - transfected CV - 1 cells 1 h after virus binding ( z - axis position – 0 . 5 m m ; red ) .

In live cells at 37 (cid:176) C , TRX – SV40 spots were stationary , except for 10 – 20 % that were laterally mobile ( see Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) . Stationary virions were now associated with caveolin - containing structures . This redistribution occurred so rapidly that by the time a coverslip was moved from ice to a micro - scope at 37 (cid:176) C for live fluorescence analysis , most TRX – SV40 had already colocalized with caveolin - 1 – GFP ( Fig . 3a , right panel ) . Electron microscopy confirmed that after 15 min at 37 (cid:176) C , the majority of virus particles had localized to caveolae ( Fig . 3c ) . Although double - positive spots were largely stationary , they could suddenly become mobile and move , within 3 – 6 s , out of the microscopic plane of focus and into the cell . Using dual - colour live microscopy with a confocal microscope , we observed this move - ment as the sudden disappearance of spots from the focal plane ( Fig . 3b ; see Supplementary Information , Movie 2 ) . These results are consistent with a process whereby , after binding to MHC class I antigens , virus particles are mobile in the plane of the membrane until they become trapped in stationary caveolae . Virus - containing caveolae are subsequently internalized , leaving no detectable cave - olin - 1 behind in the plasma membrane . In a time frame of 3 min , we did not observe internalization of caveolae devoid of virus , indi - cating that the virus may somehow induce or accelerate the process of caveolar internalization . Entry into caveosomes — intermediate organelles in caveolar endocytosis . After 0 . 2 – 4 . 0 h of association with cells at 37 (cid:176) C , the majority of SV40 is known to be intracellular and localized in irregularly - shaped , membrane - bounded organelles 5 . When viewed by wide - field microscopy in live cells incubated with TRX – SV40 , these organelles could be seen as brightly fluorescent spots that were dispersed throughout the cytosol and underwent slow , non - directional movements ( Fig . 4a , right panel ; see Supplementary Information , Movie 3 ) . Most of these spots were positive for cave - olin - 1 – GFP ( Fig . 4a , left panel ) and resembled , in size and distri - bution , the caveolin - containing , intracellular organelles that were also seen in the absence of SV40 ( Fig . 2a , c ) . After entry of TRX – SV40 into live cells expressing caveolin - 1 – GFP , the majority of caveolin - 1 – GFP - positive organelles that TRX – SV40 entered were indeed already present in the cytoplasm before addition of the virus ( Fig . 4b ) . In other words , most virions were transported to pre - existing caveolin - 1 - containing organelles . To investigate whether these organelles are part of the endo - somal / lysosomal system , we incubated cells with TRX – SV40 together with two ligands that are known to be internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( BODIPY - FL - labelled transferrin and fluorescein - labelled Semliki Forest virus ( FLX – SFV ) ) or with a fluorescent fluid - phase marker ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) – dextran ) . After internalization , these had a similar distri - bution to that of TRX – SV40 , although no overlap with TRX – SV40 containing organelles was observed ( Fig . 4c ) . The fact that SV40 - containing organelles are distinct from classical endosomes was also indicated by their lack of staining in fixed cells with antibodies against EEA1 , a marker protein of early endosomes ( Fig . 4c ) . The distribution of caveolin - 1 – GFP was distinct from that of EEA1 , whether in the presence or absence of SV40 ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , virus - containing organelles did not accumulate Lysotracker green , a lysosomal marker ( data not shown ) , and were not stained by antibodies against TGN46 ( Fig . 4c ) or mannosidase II ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that these organelles are not related to lysosomes or to the Golgi complex , confirming our previous electron - microscopic observa - tions 5 . Finally , at this intermediate stage of uptake , the distribution of SV40 did not overlap with those of markers of the ER or of the intermediate compartment ( data not shown ; see below ) . Thin - section electron microscopy showed that 2 h after uptake , the majority of virus - containing intracellular organelles were membrane - bound , had irregular shapes and sizes , and contained numerous virus particles ( Fig . 4d ; see also ref . 5 ) . Although some of these organelles were near the plasma membrane , most were locat - ed deeper in the cytoplasm . They clearly differed in size and com - plexity from the primary endocytic vesicles that contained a single virus particle and which were observed at earlier time points ( Fig . 4c , final panel ) . To determine whether the virus - containing organelles constitute deep invaginations that are still connected to the plasma membrane , we tested whether extracellular ions could reach the virus after inter - nalization . For this purpose , we labelled SV40 with the fluorophore fluorescein - X ( FLX ) , because its excitation spectrum is pH - sensi - tive 21 . After binding of FLX – SV40 in the cold , or after internalization at 37 (cid:176) C for 3 h , we resuspended CV - 1 cells in buffers of different pH values ( pH 4 . 0 , 7 . 0 and 8 . 0 ) and immediately analysed them with a fluorometer 22 . As expected , the spectrum of membrane - bound FLX – SV40 was sensitive to pH ( Fig . 5a ) . In contrast , the fluorescence emitted by internalized FLX – SV40 did not change ( Fig . 5b ) .

Together , these results show that the majority of incoming SV40 enters a population of pre - existing , caveolin - 1 - rich , intracellular organelles with a pH of ~ 7 . 0 ; these are distinct from organelles of the classical endocytic and secretory pathways . As they seem to be unique to the caveolar uptake pathway , and as they contain cave - olin - 1 , we have named them ‘caveosomes’ . SV40 is sorted from caveosomes . The passage of SV40 within the caveolar endocytic pathway was considerably slower than the trans - port of ligands within the coated - vesicle - mediated endocytic path - way . Typically , it was ~ 20 min before the virus was internalized from the plasma membrane and 20 – 40 min before it reached the caveosomes . A further 2 – 4 h were needed before the virus started to leave the caveosomes . At this time , video microscopy indicated that caveosomes became more dynamic ; their morphology underwent rapid changes and some of them fused with each other . Fission reactions also occurred , and virions could be seen to exit caveo - somes in vesicular and tubular structures ( see below ) . The departure of viruses from caveosomes could be readily visualized by dual - colour , time - lapse microscopic examination of live , caveolin - 1 – GFP - expressing cells incubated with TRX – SV40 at 37 (cid:176) C for 4 – 6 h . From caveosomes , which were yellow in colour , red extensions emerged that were mobile and tubular ( Fig . 6a , open arrowheads ; see Supplementary Information , Movie 4a – d ) . These frequently broke off and moved swiftly away from the caveosome . The average length of the tubular structures that detached from caveosomes was ~ 1 m m , but some were as long as 7 m m ( Fig . 6b ; see Supplementary Information , Movie 5a – c ) . As these TRX – SV40 - containing tubules were red , they were devoid of detectable cave - olin - 1 – GFP ( Fig . 6d , upper panels ) . Their formation must therefore involve molecular sorting within caveosomes . We were sometimes able to observe separation of red and green signals within a single caveosome , indicating that caveolin - 1 – GFP and TRX – SV40 were being separated into distinct domains ( Fig . 6d ; lower panels ) , each of which could detach from the caveosome as distinct vesicles . Thin - sec - tion electron microscopy showed the presence of virus - containing tubular structures , which could be seen attached to vesicular organelles that were devoid of virus ( Fig . 6c , upper panel ) , or as apparently detached structures ( Fig . 6c , lower panel ) . These were often observed in close proximity to microtubules ( Fig . 6c , open arrowheads ) . Entry of SV40 is a two - step process . The tubular SV40 carriers that emerged from caveosomes were flexible ( see Supplementary Information , Movie 5a – c ) and moved through the cytosol in the direction of their long axis . Compared with that of slow - moving early vesicles and caveosomes , their movement was rapid , averaging 0 . 5 m m s – 1 ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Although individual carriers could be seen to move in both retrograde and anterograde directions , net move - ment was towards the perinuclear area , which contained the larger organelles in which the fluorescent virus accumulated . A merged picture of all frames obtained over a period of 3 – 4 min ( see Methods ) showed that the majority of tracks were positive for TRX – SV40 and negative for caveolin - 1 – GFP ( Fig . 6a , right panel ) . articles 479 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 MAY 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com . 6 h TRX – SV40 . 6 h TRX – SV40 Caveolin - 1 – GFP Plasmamembrane0 – 10 min Early vesicles 30 – 60 min Caveosomes120 – 180 min Tubules 240 – 300 min 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 60 120 180 240 300 360 Colocalization with caveolin - 1 – GFP Plasma - membrane localization Peripheral localization Perinuclear localization % o f t o t a l T R X – SV 40 s i gna l Chase time at 37 (cid:176) C ( min after binding ) a b A v e r age s peed ( m m s – 1 ) 0 . 6 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Figure 7 Entry of SV40 is a two - step process . a , Live fluorescence analysis ( left panel , wide - field microscopy ; right panel , dual - colour laser - scanning confocal microscopy ; z - axis position – 0 . 5 m m in each case ) of cells transfected with cave - olin - 1 – GFP ( green ) 4 h after virus binding .

We quantified the fluorescent virus signal that was present on the plas - ma membrane , in caveolae , in caveosomes , and in the perinuclear organelles ( see Methods ) . During the first 20 min , the plasma - membrane - bound virus first associated with caveolae , and were internalized at 37 (cid:176) C into caveosomes with a half time of 60 min . After 2 . 5 h , colocalization with caveolin - 1 – GFP rapidly decreased , and soon thereafter the virus accumulated in perinuclear organelles . After sorting , SV40 - containing carriers travel along microtubules . To investigate the possible function of microtubules in the move - ment of virions from caveosomes to the perinuclear area , we monitored TRX – SV40 - containing carriers in PtK2 cells express - ing yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) - tagged a - tubulin . The time course of T - antigen expression , and its sensitivity to cholesterol depletion , indicated that SV40 infects these cells , as is the case in CV - 1 cells , through the caveolar pathway ( data not shown ) . Video sequences showed that fast - moving virus carriers were moving along pre - assembled microtubules ( Fig . 8a ; see Supplementary Information , Movie 6a , b ) . Although virions appeared to move in both antero - and retrograde directions , the virus eventually accu - mulated in larger peripheral organelles ( see below ) . Closer analysis showed that the virus - containing tubular structures that budded from caveosomes were already attached to microtubules ( see Supplementary Information , Movie 6c , d ) . Nocodazole , a drug that disrupts the microtubule cytoskeleton , did not inhibit uptake of virus into CV - 1 or PtK2 cells , nor its transport to caveosomes ( Fig . 8a ) . However , virus - containing caveosomes did not enter the dynamic phase , and neither tubular extensions nor tubular carriers were formed . Transport of the virus to perinuclear sites of accumulation was inhibited ( Fig . 8a ; see Supplementary Information , Movie 7a ) . Some virus - containing vesicles budded from caveosomes , but did not move away rapidly ( see Supplementary Information , Movie 7b ) . These results show that , although the microtubule network was not needed for trans - port of SV40 from the plasma membrane to caveosomes , it is evi - dently essential for efficient transport from caveosomes to the ER . To investigate whether the microtubule - dependent transport step is needed for productive SV40 infection , we analysed expres - sion of T - antigen 20 h after addition of virus in the presence or absence of nocodazole . In the presence of nocodazole , T - antigen expression was blocked ( Fig . 8b , middle panels ) . No expression of this viral protein was detected even after 48 h ( data not shown ) . When nocodazole was removed after 20 h , the virus accumulated in the smooth ER ( see below ) and within 12 h T - antigen expression was observed ( Fig . 8b , lower panels ) . We conclude that micro - tubule - dependent transport of virus to the ER is part of the path - way of productive infection , and that nocodazole blocks infection at a late stage of the entry process . After sorting , SV40 rapidly accumulates in the smooth ER . After leaving caveosomes , TRX – SV40 accumulated in large , heteroge - neous , stationary organelles in the perinuclear region of the cell . The fact that net transport occurred to these organelles was shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ; Fig . 9a ) . Four hours after addition of TRX – SV40 , we bleached perinuclear regions containing accumulated virus using a high - power laser beam . Upon subsequent incubation at 37 (cid:176) C , accumulation of new fluorescent virus in the same organelles could be observed by quan - titative live fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 9a ; see Supplementary Information , Movie 8 ) . To characterize in more detail the compartment in which incoming SV40 accumulated , we allowed TRX – SV40 to enter CV - 1 cells for 16 h . As described above , at this time the virus was present mainly in heterogeneous organelles located in the perinuclear region ( Fig . 9b ) , the largest of which was > 8 m m in diameter .

Images were obtained as merged recordings ( 52 frames , 4 - s intervals ; see Methods ) . Initial virus entry is not dependent on an intact microtubule skeleton ( right panel ) , but move - ment towards a perinuclear site is ( left panel ) . Note the long tracks of moving viri - ons in control cells that run along pre - assembled microtubules ( small panels on left , open arrowheads ) ; these microtubules are not present in nocodazole - treated cells ( small panels on right ) .

When transport from caveosomes to the smooth ER is blocked by noco - dazole , no accumulation of TRX – SV40 and T - antigen expression is seen ( middle panels , asterisks indicate nuclei ) . After removal of nocodazole and incubation for 12 h in normal medium at 37 (cid:176) C ( lower panels ) , all TRX – SV40 has now accumulat - ed in the smooth ER and T - antigen expression is observed . Scale bars represent 10 m m . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd organelles were clearly devoid of caveolin - 1 – GFP ( only 9 % overlap ; Fig . 9b , uppermost row ) , and were not stained with antibodies against caveolin - 1 ( data not shown ) . When TRX – SV40 - loaded cells were analysed by immunofluorescence using antibodies against marker proteins , we found that many ( 80 % ) of virus - containing perinuclear organelles were positive for syntaxin17 ( Syn17 ; Fig . 9b , second row ) , a recently identified marker of smooth ER 25 , 26 . Some also stained positively for ER markers such as BiP , calnexin ( data not shown , see ref . 5 ) and PDI ( 70 % ; Fig . 9b , third row ) , and for the intermediate - compartment marker ERGIC - 53 ( 54 % ; data not shown ) . No significant colocalization with the Golgi marker man - nosidase II was observed ( 5 % ; Fig . 9b , lowermost row ) . These organelles did not accumulate Lysotracker green ( data not shown ) , indicating that they are distinct from lysosomes . These results indi - cate that the tubular network seen in the ER as the site of virus accumulation may correspond to a smooth ER compartment , a conclusion that is consistent with previous electron - microscopic observations 5 . Discussion Although several ligands and pathogens are known to be internal - ized through cell - surface caveolae ( reviewed in ref . 27 ) , the subse - quent intracellular pathways have remained elusive . We have analysed the entry of SV40 into live cells and have visualized their transfer from caveolae in the plasma membrane to the smooth ER . Together with previous observations 5 , 7 , 8 , our results show that after binding to the cell surface , virions move laterally into caveolae . They apparently trigger a change in the caveolae that results in induction or acceleration of membrane - fission reactions that detach the caveolae from the plasma membrane and allow them to move into the cytoplasm within small , caveolin - 1 - containing vesi - cles . Virus particles are delivered by these small vesicles to pre - exist - ing , stationary , membranous organelles that we have called caveo - somes . Delivery probably occurs by direct membrane fusion . Caveosomes are distributed throughout the cytoplasm , are numerous , and are heterogeneous in size and shape . Being consid - erably larger than the primary , caveolae - derived vesicles , they can contain many SV40 particles . Their membrane contains caveolin - 1 in a conformational state that is similar to that in the plasma mem - brane , but different from that in the Golgi complex . The pH in caveosomes is neutral , and our preliminary experiments with fil - ipin staining indicate that , like caveolae , they are rich in cholesterol ( our unpublished observations ) . The location of caveosomes in the cytosol , their lack of visible connections to the plasma membrane , and their inaccessibility to extracellular protons confirm that they are not connected to the extracellular space . Two to four hours after arrival of the virus , caveosomes become more dynamic . Although still stationary in the cytoplasm , they begin to undergo rapid shape changes , including formation of long , tubular , virus - containing membrane extensions . After detaching from the caveosomes , these extensions serve as carrier vesicles that transport virions from the caveosomes to the smooth ER compart - ment in which the virus accumulates . The formation and intracel - lular movement of these carrier vesicles requires active participa - tion of microtubules . Unlike the primary endocytic vesicles that carry SV40 from the plasma membrane to caveosomes , these carri - er vesicles do not contain caveolin - 1 . At this stage , caveolin - 1 is excluded from the virus - containing parts of caveosomes , and seems to cycle back to the plasma membrane in vesicles that are devoid of virus . Although we do not yet know the reason for the gradual change in caveosome dynamics and the activation of its sorting articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 MAY 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 481 4 : 21 : 68 0 : 00 : 00 59 : 02 : 98 Bleaching R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Time ( min : sec : msec ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 : 00 : 00 14 : 24 : 00 28 : 48 : 00 43 : 12 : 00 57 : 36 : 00 a b TRX – SV40 TRX – SV40 TRX – SV40 TRX – SV40 Caveolin - 1 – GFP PDI Syn17 Mannosidase II Merged image Merged image Mergedimage Merged image S y n17 T R X – SV 40 P D I T R X – SV 40 Figure 9 SV40 finally accumulates in a smooth ER compartment . a , FRAP analysis ( z - axis position – 0 . 5 m m ) in CV - 1 cells at 37 (cid:176) C ( time is shown in min : s : ms ; zero represents 4 h after binding of virus ) , showing transport to a distinct tubulovesicular organelle ( yellow dashed line ) .

Scale bars repre - sent 5 m m . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles function , it may be that the caveolar endocytosis pathway is regu - lated in a complex manner 15 . The fact that the caveolar pathway constitutes the infectious route of SV40 is indicated by the effects of cholesterol - depleting drugs that inhibit both formation of caveolae and virus infection 7 , 8 . Expression of N - terminally truncated caveolin - 3 ( ref . 11 ) and of the N - terminally GFP - tagged caveolin - 1 construct described here also inhibit infection . Although other endocytic mechanisms remain active in the presence of these mutant caveolins , SV40 is not internalized from the plasma membrane . We have shown that infection is also blocked by nocodazole , which disrupts the micro - tubule cytoskeleton and prevents transport of virus from caveo - somes to the ER . This indicates that in order to be infectious , the virus must not only be internalized by caveolae but must also be transported to the ER . Productive infection of SV40 is generally thought to involve penetration of virus particles into the cytosol and subsequent transport through nuclear - pore complexes 28 , 29 . Using the tech - niques described here , we have not observed free virus particles in the cytosol or the nucleus , nor have we observed import of fluores - cent SV40 VP - 1 into the nucleus . Further studies are needed to determine how the genome of the virus moves from the smooth ER to the nucleus . Although it is clear that caveolae and caveosomes exist in the absence of virus infection , our results do not provide clues as to the physiological function of a caveolae – caveosome – ER pathway . It is possible that it has a role in cholesterol homeostasis — caveolae are rich in cholesterol and raft - forming lipids , and have been implicat - ed in cholesterol regulation 30 – 35 . As caveolae are also rich in sig - nalling receptors 36 , an internalization pathway that bypasses degradative organelles may have other regulatory functions . Recently , it was found that FimH - expressing Escherichia coli cells use caveolae to enter phagocytic mast cells 37 . The intracellular com - partment in which these bacteria reside and replicate may be relat - ed to caveosomes , as it does not fuse with endosomes or lysosomes . Moreover , it is likely that viruses other than SV40 use the caveolar route . Potential candidates include picornaviruses and other non - enveloped viruses that are known to have pH - independent entry mechanisms . Polyomavirus , which is related to SV40 , seems to enter a pathway that is similar to that of SV40 4 , 38 , 39 , although recent observations indicate that caveolin and dynamins may not be involved 40 . Methods Antibodies and reagents . Polyclonal antisera against mannosidase II , syntaxin 17 and TGN46 are described elsewhere 25 , 41 , 42 . Polyclonal antibodies against PDI were from StressGen ( Victoria , Canada ) ; monoclonal antibodies against human EEA1 were from Transduction Laboratories ; polyclonal antibodies against the N termi - nus of caveolin - 1 ( N20 ) were from Santa Cruz ; monoclonal antibodies against GFP were from Boehringer . Polyclonal antiserum against SV40 was raised in rabbits immunized with 200 m g of heat - inactivated SV40 in Freud’s adjuvant , according to standard procedures . This serum was able to detect all three structural proteins . FLX – SFV was prepared as described 1 , and according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Molecular Probes ) . BODIPY - FL – transferrin , Texas Red - X and fluorescein - X were from Molecular Probes . FITC – dextran ( relative molecular mass 42 , 000 ) was from Sigma – Aldrich ( Steinheim , Germany ) . Media and reagents for tissue culture were from GibcoBRL . All other chemicals were from Sigma – Aldrich . Preparation of fluorophore - labelled SV40 . SV40 was purified by a modification of existing protocols 43 , 44 . Briefly , 24 T175 flasks of confluent CV - 1 cells were infected with a stock of SV40 at a multiplicity of infection of 0 . 01 . After 10 days , cells were freeze – thawed three times , and debris was spun down at 10 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:176) C . The supernatant was saved and the pellet was resuspended in 0 . 02 volume of supernatant . This suspen - sion was freeze – thawed a further three times and debris was repelleted . Both supernatants were combined and 20 ml were loaded on a 10 - ml cushion of HEPES - buffered CsCl ( 1 . 4 g ml – 1 ) . The virus was banded in the CsCl cushion by centrifugation at 24 , 000r . p . m . for 3 h at 4 (cid:176) C in a SW28 rotor ( Beckman ) . The banded virus was isolated , checked for density ( 1 . 34 g ml – 1 ) and diluted five times in fresh HEPES - buffered CsCl ( 1 . 34 g ml – 1 ) . This suspension was centrifuged to equilibrium at 40 , 000 r . p . m . for 16 h at 4 (cid:176) C in a 70 . 1 Ti rotor ( Beckman ) . The lower virus band was isolated and dialysed extensively against 0 . 1 M carbonate buffer pH 8 . 3 . The virus was pelleted by centrifugation at 50 , 000 r . p . m . for 45 min at room temperature in a SW - 55 Ti rotor ( Beckman ) , resuspended in 0 . 1 M carbonate buffer pH 8 . 3 , and stored in aliquots at – 80 (cid:176) C . Virus ( 1 mg at 1 mg ml – 1 ) was labelled with 33 m l Texas Red - X – succinimidyl ester or fluorescein - X – succinimidyl ester ( 10mgml – 1 in dimethylsulphoxide ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Molecular Probes ) . These fluo - rophores react exclusively with free amines , resulting in a stable carboxamide bond , and contain a seven - atom aminohexanoyl spacer ( X ) , which allows higher degrees of labelling without functional perturbance of the virus . Labelled virus was repurified with CsCl as described above , dialysed against virion buffer ( 10mM HEPES pH7 . 9 , 150mM NaCl and 1mM CaCl 2 ) and stored in 2 - m g aliquots at – 20 (cid:176) C . Construction and expression of caveolin - 1 – GFP . Caveolin - 1 – GFP was constructed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification of canine cave - olin - 1 complementary DNA from pBluescript - VIP21 ( ref . 45 ) , using a standard T3 primer and 5 ¢ - CGGTACCGTTGTTTCTTTCTGCATGTTGATGCG , followed by cloning of the Eco RI – Kpn I fragment from the PCR product into a pEGFP - N1 expression vector ( Clontech ) . The resulting construct con - tains the canine caveolin - 1 gene in frame and upstream of the EGFP sequence with a spacer sequence of 30 nucleotides , 5 ¢ - CCGCGGGCCCGGGATCCACC GGTCGCCACC , corresponding to the amino - acid sequence Pro - Arg - Ala - Arg - Asp - Pro - Pro - Val - Ala - Leu . CV - 1 cells were grown to 70 – 90 % confluen - cy on 12 - mm Alcian Blue - coated coverslips and were transiently transfected with 1 . 5 – 3 . 0 m g of plas - mid DNA , using superfect reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Qiagen ) ; transfection efficiency was ~ 50 % . Cells , which showed relatively low levels of expression , were analysed after 16 – 20h . Western blotting , sucrose gradients and immunoprecipitation . CV - 1 cells in 6 - cm dishes were transiently transfected with caveolin - 1 – GFP and , after 16h , lysed in 10 mM Tris – HCl pH7 . 5 , containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and protease - inhibitor cocktail . After lysis , nuclei were spun 5 , 000 g for 5min at 4 (cid:176) C and the postnuclear supernatant was either analysed directly by electrophoresis and immunoblotting or heated for 10min at 37 (cid:176) C to dissolve raft domains complete - ly . These lysates were loaded onto a 5 – 50 % linear sucrose gradient containing 10mM Tris – HCl , pH7 . 5 , and centrifuged at 4 (cid:176) C for 18h at 38 , 000r . p . m . in a SW60 rotor ( Beckman ) . Aliquots ( 500 m ) were collected , TCA - precipitated and analysed for caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 1 – GFP by electrophoresis and immunoblotting . Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an anti - GFP antibody was carried out as described 46 . Immunofluorescence microscopy . Roughly 10 5 CV - 1 cells were grown to confluency on 12 - mm Alcian blue - coated coverslips and incu - bated with 1 m g ( 10 3 PFU per cell ) of TRX – SV40 in R - medium ( RPMI 1640 , 10mM HEPES pH6 . 8 and 0 . 2 % BSA ) for 2h at 4 (cid:176) C . Cells were washed extensively with ice - cold R - medium and incubated in total growth medium ( DMEM , 10 % FCS , 1 · Glutamax and 1 · penicillin / streptomycin ) at 5 % CO 2 and 37 (cid:176) C . At the indicated time points , cells were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde , quenched with 50mM NH 4 Cl , permeabilized with 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) saponin and then incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies . Coverslips were mounted in Moviol containing DAPCO and examined using a Leica confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axiovert wide - field microscope ( see ‘Analysis and quantification of images’ ) . Thin - section electron microscopy . CV - 1 cells were fixed , embedded and sectioned as described 5 . pH - dependent excitation scans of FLX – SV40 . CV - 1 cells on 6 - cm dishes were incubated with 10 m g FLX – SV40 or 5mg FITC – dextran for 2h at 4 (cid:176) C in R - medium . Cells were extensively washed with ice - cold R - medium and either directly resuspended in PBS of different pH values , or further incubated for 3h in normal growth medium . Cells were transferred to a quartz cuvette with a small stirrer at room temperature and excited with a fluorometer between 420 and 500nm with 1 - nm increments . The light emitted at 520nm was measured and plot - ted as light - intensity units . After this , 10 m M monensin and nigericin were added to the same cuvette , incubated for 10min at room temperature and the same scan was repeated . Data are expressed as aver - ages of four independent experiments , which showed less than 2 % variation . Time - lapse live fluorescence microscopy . TRX – SV40 was bound to CV - 1 cells or to CV - 1 cells expressing caveolin - 1 – GFP and was internalized as described above . Endocytic / lysosomal structures were labelled by binding of TRX – SV40 in the pres - ence of appropriate markers ( BODIPY - FL – transferrin , FITC – dextran , FLX – SFV or Lysotracker green ) and subsequent internalization as described above . At the indicated times , coverslips were transferred to custom - built aluminium microscope - slide chambers ( Workshop Biochemistry , ETH , Zürich ) for live analysis in CO 2 - independent medium , placed on a heated stage and analysed at 37 (cid:176) C using wide - field or confocal microscopy . For wide - field microscopy , cells were analysed using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a · 100 NA1 . 40 plan - apochromat lens . Images were collected using a cooled charge - coupled - device ( CCD ) camera ( Hamamatsu ) at 3 - s intervals using a computer - controlled shutter with a standard FITC / Texas Red filter set and exposure times of 0 . 5 – 1 . 0s per image . For confocal microscopy , cells were analysed using an inverted Leica microscope ( DM IRBE ) with a · 100 NA1 . 40 plan - apochromat lens and using computer - controlled excitation with an argon laser at 568nm ( Texas Red ) or 488nm ( GFP ) . Signals were collected at 3 - s intervals using a photomultiplier tube ( PMT ) and were then digitized ( 1 , 024 · 1 , 024 pixels ) and converted into images using Leica TCS software . The amount of photobleaching in each channel was analysed by calculating the total fluorescence intensity in each frame of a movie sequence , and was comparable for both signals ( Texas Red , 25 % ; GFP , 20 % ) . Analysis and quantification of images and video sequences . For both wide - field and confocal microscopy , CV - 1 and PtK2 cells ( cell peripheries were extensively spread and had thicknesses of 1 . 0 – 1 . 5 m m ) were first focused at the apical plasma membrane ; this was set as the reference z - axis position of 0 . 0 m m and was used for plasma - membrane studies . For intracel - lular analysis of cells , the z - axis position was computer - controlled and set at 0 . 5 m m below the apical membrane ( – 0 . 5 m m ) . In confocal images , the detector pinhole was set at 1 airy – disk unit ( a . u . ) , resulting in a focal - plane thickness of ~ 120nm . Where indicated , the pinhole was set at 0 . 2a . u . to eliminate out - of - focus signals .

For single - image presentation of single - colour ( TRX – SV40 ) movie sequences , all images were merged , resulting in tracks that indicate movement . For single - image pres - entation of dual - colour movie sequences ( TRX – SV40 and EGFP – caveolin - 1 or TRX – SV40 and YFP – a - tubulin ) , the TRX – SV40 signal in each image was coloured red , the EGFP – caveolin - 1 or YFP – a - tubulin signal in each image coloured green and all images were merged , resulting in tracks that were coloured red , green or yellow , indicating movement of single - positive or double - positive structures . Movements were quantified by marking the position of a specific carrier in at least 20 con - secutive images . Average and maximum speeds were calculated by measuring the distance travelled between marked positions in two subsequent images along the whole track . Speed values are expressed as the mean of at least four carriers per movie in at least three different cells . The amounts of overlap in confocal images were quantified using Adobe Photoshop ( version 5 . 0 ; Adobe Systems Inc . ) , by subtracting the green channel from the red channel , resulting in a picture of non - overlapping red elements . Total intensity of the non - overlapping red signal was measured , sub - tracted from the total red signal , and the resulting overlapping signal is expressed as mean percentage of total red signal ( from at least four different cells per time point ) . Bulk flow of the virus signal was quantified by marking regions of interest in at least four different cells at each time point ( all cells were imaged at a z - axis position of – 0 . 5 m m ) , corresponding to the plasma membrane , the cell periphery and a perinuclear area , as described 47 . However , when prominent accumulation near the nucleus was observed , this whole structure was included in the perinuclear region of interest . Total intensity was measured in regions of interest and was plotted as percentage of total cellular signal . FRAP data were quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensities of the whole cell and of the bleached area before , directly after and during recovery of bleaching , using the Openlab software . Relative fluorescence intensity of the bleached area over time ( R t ) was calculated using the following equation : ( 1 ) where I total ( 0 ) is the total intensity of the cell before bleaching , I bleached ( 0 ) is the total intensity of the bleached area before bleaching , I bleached ( t ) is the intensity of the bleached area over time ( directly after bleaching and recovery ) , and I total ( t ) is the intensity of the whole cell over time . In this way , data were corrected for overall bleaching during the experiment . RECEIVED 30 SEPTEMBER 2000 ; REVISED 4 DECEMBER 2000 ; ACCEPTED 6 FEBRUARY 2001 ; PUBLISHED 18 APRIL 2001 . 1 .

A part of the membrane in which both mobile and sta - tionary spots can be discerned ( recorded at 0 . 33 Hz , shown at 20 Hz , 50 frames ) . The mobile spots ( arrows ) move randomly in the membrane . There is considerable bleaching due to the high expo - sure . Scale bar : 2 µm . Movie 2 Dynamics of TRX - SV40 and CAV1 – GFP on the plasma membrane of CV - 1 cells directly after shifting to 37º C recorded with confocal laser scanning microscopy . The movie shows parts of the mem - brane with TRX - SV40 ( red ) virions and CAV1 - GFP positive microdomains ( green ) , and the resulting yellow spots on the mem - brane ( recorded at 0 . 33 Hz , shown at 20 Hz , 80 frames ) . These spots are stationary in the membrane , but that three of them ( indi - cated by arrowheads ) disappear , whereas others remain in place . CAV1 – GFP is present as a diffusive dynamic staining between the spots . Scale bar : 2 µm . Movie 3 Dynamics of TRX - SV40 being internalised in CV - 1 cells , incubated for 1 h at 37 ºC after virus binding before recording with wide field microscopy ( recorded at 0 . 33 Hz , shown at 10 Hz , 50 frames ) . Small vesicles gain in speed ( arrow ) , by contrast with spots ( of about the same size ) on the membrane ( asterisk ) , which have not been internalised yet . Some larger vesicles are already visible ( arrowhead ) . The vesicles movements do not share a common ori - entation . Scale bar : 7 µm . Movie 4a Dual - colour live - fluorescence laser scanning confocal microscopy recorded in CAV1 – GFP transfected CV - 1 cells 4 h after virus bind - ing and shifting to 37 ºC ( recorded at 0 . 33 Hz , shown at 10 Hz ) . The movie shows part of a cell ( part of the nucleus is visible in upper left corner ) in which virus has accumulated in CAV1 – GFP - containing organelles , but is also present in unlabelled vesicles . Arrowheads indicate the formation of multi - domain organelles and separation of virus from a CAV1 – GFP containing vesicle . The vesicles are dynamic and they interact frequently in a ‘kiss - and - run’ fashion . High - speed travelling structures are only positive for virus ( red ) . Scale bar : 2 µm . Movie 4b Same as movie 4a , especially focussed on tubule formation from a virus - positive vesicle ( lower arrowhead ) , on which some CAV1 – GFP is still located ( upper arrowhead ) . Double positive vesi - cles ( yellow , left upper region ) do not move . Scale bar : 2 µm . Movie 4c Similar to movie 4a , but at 20 Hz . This enlargement shows the dynamics of sorting indicated by arrowheads . The separation of green and red domains on one organelle ( upper arrowhead ) , and the fast sorting and detachment of virus - positive tubules from dou - ble positive vesicles are visible . Scale bar : 5 µm Move 4d Similar to movie 4c . Upper arrow , sorting of virus ; middle arrow , par - tial fusion of one double positive vesicle with another ( upper arrow ) and subsequent fusion . Right arrow , dynamics of several small organelles , as examples of fusion and fission reactions . Scale bar : 5 µm . Movie 5a Dynamics of TRX - SV40 targeted to a perinuclear accumulation 6 h after virus binding ( recorded at 0 . 5 Hz , shown at 10 Hz , 50 frames ) . Large tubular carriers that can span a large part of the cell ( arrows ) and move both towards and away from the perinuclear accumula - tion site . In the periphery , dynamics of tubule formation ( white box , shown in movie 7a ) . Scale bar : 5 µm . Movie 5b White box in movie 5a , showing the dynamic formation of tubules from a vesicular structure ( arrowhead ) . Note how tubules extend from the vesicular structure and ‘search for their way out’ . Scale bar : 2 µm . Movie 5c The same as movie 5a , from another part of the same cell . Movie 6a Dual - colour live - fluorescence microscopy recorded in PtK2 cells expressing YFP - a tubulin , 6 h after virus binding and shifting to 37 ºC ( recorded at 0 . 25 Hz , shown at 10 Hz ) . There is an intricate net - work of microtubules . Virus has started to accumulate near the nucleus . Tubules containing virus move along pre - assembled microtubule tracks ( arrows ) . Vesicular structures in the periphery are not moving ( asterisk , bottom left ) . There is considerable bleaching of YFP - a tubulin . Scale bar : 10 µm . Movie 6b Same as movie 6a , a selection of the upper left region from movie 6a . Scale bar : 10 µm . Movie 6c and 6d Same as movie 6a , focussed on vesicular structures from which tubules come out ( arrowheads ) . The tubules grow along the align - ing microtubules . Scale bar : 5 µm . Movie 7a Same as movie 6 , but the cells have been treated with nocodazole throughout the whole experiment . Viruses have entered the cells and have accumulated in vesicular structures , but do not move towards the nucleus . Vesicular structures are dynamic , but show no net movement . There is a large amount of small vesicles . Scale bar : 10 µm . Movie 7b Selection of movie 7a ( see white box ) indicating that fission of big - ger vesicular structures results in the formation of multiple small vesicles ( arrow ) , instead of larger tubules . Scale bar : 2 µm . Movie 8 Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiment in CV - 1 cells recorded with laser scanning confocal microscopy ( recorded at 0 . 017 Hz , shown at 10 Hz ) 6 h after virus binding and shifting to 37 ºC . The movie shows a cell which has accumulated a large amount of virus at the perinuclear site , but yet contains a lager amount of carriers . In the second frame , the prominent accumula - tion ( indicated by yellow line ) completely disappeared ( owing to bleaching with a high power laser beam ) , and subsequently recov - ers with newly targeted virus . The structure before and after bleach - ing is similar . Scale bar : 5 µm .
