Highlights 2  SARS - COV - 2 Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al provides fast results , demands relatively few human and data resources , and delivers high throughput .  In 1 , 642 SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples , no Variant of Concern was missed by Variant PCR , confirmed by whole genome sequencing .  All samples identified as “non - VoC lineages” by the Variant PCR , were confirmed by whole genome sequencing .  The Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al . , is a good and effective method for rapid screening for variants of concern , applicable for most diagnostic high - volume laboratories . 3 Abstract Objectives : The emerging SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern ( VoC ) , B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 , with increased transmission and / or immune evasion , emphasise the need for broad and rapid variant monitoring . Our high - volume laboratory introduced a PCR variant assay ( Variant PCR ) in January 2021 based on the protocol by Vogels et al . Study design : To assess whether Variant PCR could be used for rapid B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 screening , all positive SARS - CoV - 2 airway samples were prospectively tested in parallel using both the Variant PCR and whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) . Results : In total 1 , 642 SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples from individual patients were tested within a time span of 4 weeks . For all samples with valid results from both Variant PCR and WGS , no VoC was missed by Variant PCR ( totalling 399 VoC detected ) . Conversely , all of the samples identified as “other lineages” ( i . e . , “non - VoC lineages” ) by the Variant PCR , were confirmed by WGS . Conclusions : The Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al . , is an effective method for rapid screening for VoC , applicable for most diagnostic laboratories within a pandemic setting . WGS is still required to confirm the identity of certain variants and for continuous surveillance of emerging VoC . Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 ; B . 1 . 1 . 7 ; B . 1 . 351 ; P . 1 ; Whole Genome Sequencing ( WGS ) ; Variants screening ; Background The discovery of a new SARS - CoV - 2 variant ( lineage B . 1 . 1 . 7 / N501Y _ V1 ) with increasing incidence in the United Kingdom in the autumn of 2020 , highlighted the importance of rapid 4 and comprehensive surveillance of SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern ( VoC ) [ 1 ] . As exemplified by the arrival of the N501Y spike mutation , which was reported to contribute to increased viral transmission [ 2 ] , rapid detection of VoC has become essential to control the current pandemic . The emergence of other VoC , such as B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 , further underlined the need for variant monitoring both in pandemic control , but also for adjusted vaccine design . The B . 1 . 1 . 7 lineage is characterised by a repertoire of 17 mutations and deletions located in the open reading frame ( ORF ) 1 a / b , ORF 8 , nucleocapsid ( N gene ) and spike gene regions [ 1 ] . B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 lineages also have a set of characteristic genetic mutations and deletions . These include both the N501Y and E484K spike mutations , which may be important for increased viral contagion and immune evasion [ 3 ] . The gold standard for the detection of VoC is whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) , which is a powerful tool to map and describe the viral genome , including monitoring for current and emerging virus variants and viral genome changes with possible biological significance [ 4 , 5 ] . WGS is increasingly performed in several countries and has given valuable insights into the emergence and dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 variants worldwide . However , sequencing is time and resource demanding and requires extensive data processing . It is therefore less apt for the comprehensive rapid variant analysis needed to contain VoC within a population in a pandemic setting . Direct PCR - based variant analysis of SARS - CoV - 2 is both rapid and inexpensive and can easily be performed on all positive samples after SARS - CoV - 2 detection using other methods . Recently , Vogels et al . published a protocol for a triplex RT - PCR assay that detects the VoC B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 by targeting characteristic deletions of the ORF1a and spike gene ( Δ69 / 70 ) [ 6 ] . This assay can be performed with hands - on and running time totalling 4 hours including RNA extraction . 5 Objectives The PCR assay based on the Vogels protocol ( in this paper termed “Variant PCR” ) was established in our high - volume laboratory at Oslo University Hospital ( OUH ) in January 2021 . To assess whether this assay could be used for rapid B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 screening , all positive SARS - CoV - 2 samples collected within a span of 4 weeks were tested in parallel using both Variant PCR and WGS . Study design Cohort and materials The Department of Microbiology at OUH receives the majority of community and hospital samples for SARS - CoV - 2 diagnostics from Oslo and parts of south - eastern Norway . Most samples are combined throat / nasopharyngeal swab specimens . Primary detection of SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples was performed by a number of high - throughput diagnostic procedures ( see below ) . All positive samples analysed for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA between 25 January and 19 February 2021 , were then prospectively included for both Variant PCR and WGS . SARS - CoV - 2 detection For the majority of the samples ( community testing ) , SARS - CoV - 2 detection was performed at the Unit for Large Scale SARS - CoV - 2 PCR Diagnostics , established to process large volumes of specimens . RNA extraction was performed on an automated Tecan Fluent 1080 workstation ( Tecan Trading AG , Switzerland ) using an in - house extraction protocol developed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ( Trondheim , Norway ) based on a standard method using magnetic beads [ 7 , 8 ] . Bacteriophage MS2 RNA ( Merck , Sigma - Aldrich , Darmstadt , Germany ) was added before extraction as internal control [ 9 ] . 6 Nucleic acid was isolated from 100 µl sample and eluted in 100 µl PCR - grade water . The eluate ( 5 µl ) was analysed by real - time RT - PCR using an Aria Dx Real - Time PCR System ( Agilent Technologies LDA , Malaysia ) in a reaction volume of 25 µl containing SuperScript III Platinum One - Step qRT - PCR Kit ( Invitrogen , Darmstadt , Germany ) , 0 . 4 µM E - gene primers and 0 . 2 µM probe described by Corman et al . , and 0 . 3 µM MS2 primers and 0 . 1 µM probe described by Dreier et al . [ 9 , 10 ] . All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Tib - Molbiol ( Berlin , Germany ) , except the double quenched E gene probe , which was provided by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc , ( Coralville , Iowa , USA ) . Thermal cycling was performed at 50ºC for 15 min for reverse transcription , followed by 95ºC for 2 min and then 45 cycles of 95ºC for 15 s and 58 ºC for 30s . For samples from in - hospital patients , the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was performed using one of the following assays ; the Cobas ® SARS - CoV - 2 kit on the Cobas ® 6800 system ( Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) , the Aptima ® SARS - COV - 2 Assay on the Panther ® System ( Hologic , Inc . , San Diego , CA , USA ) , the Cobas ® SARS - CoV - 2 & Influenza A / B kit on the Cobas Liat ® System ( Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) , or the Xpert ® Xpress SARS - CoV - 2 / Flu / RSV kit on the GeneXpert Instrument System ( Cepheid , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . All positive samples were re - extracted for Variant PCR and WGS analysis , regardless of CT values from the primary detection assay . Variant PCR Variant PCR was performed on positive samples only , using the Vogels protocol [ 11 ] . RNA from positive samples was re - extracted using magnetic beads on Tecan Fluent 1080 as described above . Real - time RT - PCR assays in 25 µl reaction volume were performed with the QuantiNova Pathogen master mix ( Qiagen , Germantown , MD , USA ) , using CDC - N1 ( “N gene” ) , Yale - Spike 69 / 70del ( “Δ69 / 70” ) and Yale - ORF1a3675 - 3677del ( “ORF1a” ) primer and probe sets in accordance with the protocol . Thermal cycling was performed at 50ºC for 7 10 min for reverse transcription , followed by 95ºC for 2 min and 40 cycles of 95ºC for 10s and 55ºC for 30s . Results indicated by target failure were interpreted in accordance with the Vogels protocol ( Table 1 ) . The N gene was regarded as a positive “pan - SARS - CoV - 2” control , and samples with CT values for N1 > 35 or undetected ( No CT ) were defined as inconclusive . Likewise , samples with Δ69 / 70 and / or ORF1a detected , but with a CT > 35 were also defined as inconclusive . Table 1 . Variant PCR interpretation criteria based on PCR results .

Samples with low CT values were diluted in PCR - graded water to normalise CT value to ≥ 20 . RNA was converted to cDNA with the SuperScript™ IV First - Strand Synthesis System ( # 18091200 , Invitrogen ) in 10 µl reactions using 4 µl RNA and random hexamers , according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , whereby the incubation 8 at 50°C was increased to 30 min . Half of the cDNA ( 5 µl ) was used as input for the library generation . Sequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer ' s instructions using the Swift Normalase ® Amplicon Panel SARS - CoV - 2 Additional Genome Coverage ( # COVG1V2 - 96 , Swift Biosciences , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) in combination with Swift Normalase ® Unique Dual Indexing Primer Plates ( # X91384 , Swift Biosciences ) , whereby 4 + 22 PCR cycles were applied during the Multiplex PCR step followed by 9 PCR cycles during the Indexing PCR step . Libraries were pooled and normalised to 4 nM , then sequenced on Novaseq SP flow cells ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) with 150 bp paired end reads . On average , 1 million reads per sample were obtained . Base calling during sequencing was performed using RTA v3 . 4 . 4 . BCL files were first demultiplexed using bcl2fastq v2 . 20 . 0 . 422 and converted to FASTQ format , and the remaining steps were performed independently for each sample . Primer sequences were trimmed from the reads using pTrimmer v1 . 3 . 3 [ 12 ] . Reads pairs that did not have known primer sequences at the beginning of both reads were discarded . The read pairs were then subjected to quality filtering and adapter trimming using fastp v0 . 20 . 1 [ 13 ] . Reads were aligned to the Wuhan - Hu - 1 reference sequence ( NC _ 045512 . 2 ; https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / nuccore / 1798174254 ) genome using bowtie2 v2 . 4 . 0 [ 14 ] . The reads at each genomic position were first collated using samtools v1 . 9 mpileup ( http : / / www . htslib . org / doc / samtools - mpileup . html ) , then iVar v1 . 3 was used to call the consensus sequence based on the mpileup output [ 15 ] . Positions covered by fewer than ten reads were masked in the consensus sequence . At each position , the nucleotide variant with the highest frequency in the reads was used . The lineages of the samples were assigned based on the consensus sequences , using Panglin and Nextclade [ 16 – 20 ] .

Results 9 Lineages and VoC by Variant PCR and WGS During the study period from 25 January to 19 February 2021 , SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in 1 , 642 ( 2 % ) in a total of 83 , 801 samples from individual patients . All positive samples were then analysed for VoC using both the Variant PCR and WGS , and results were compared ( Table 2 ) . Inconclusive Variant PCR results due to no CT value for the N gene were regarded as technical failures and excluded from the analysis . For simplicity , results are presented using Pangolin nomenclature only [ 20 ] . The Variant PCR showed 466 ( 28 % ) isolates to be potential B . 1 . 1 . 7 variants , 21 ( 1 % ) to be potential B . 1 . 351 or P . 1 variants , whereas 190 ( 12 % ) samples were inconclusive . WGS results from the same samples showed 394 ( 24 % ) to be B . 1 . 1 . 7 , five ( 0 . 3 % ) were B1 . 351 and no isolates were found belonging to the P . 1 lineage . A total of 171 ( 10 % ) isolates with valid results from Variant PCR had poor or no sequencing results and thus could not be classified . Direct comparison of the results from these two methods on a single sample level , showed a high concordance between the Variant PCR and WGS results . 394 ( 84 . 5 % ) potential B . 1 . 1 . 7 isolates identified by Variant PCR were confirmed by WGS , whereas 56 potentially B . 1 . 1 . 7 isolates did not produce conclusive WGS results . Sixteen samples defined as B . 1 . 1 . 7 by Variant PCR were classified as B . 1 . 525 by WGS . Importantly , no isolates identified by WGS as B . 1 . 1 . 7 had a conflicting identification by Variant PCR . For the 21 potential B . 1 . 351 or P . 1 samples found by Variant PCR , 5 ( 24 % ) were confirmed by WGS to be B . 1 . 351 , whereas 13 ( 62 % ) were variants B . 1 . 1 . 261 , B . 1 . 1 . 74 or B . 1 . 1 . 318 . Of the 11 potential B . 1 . 375 found by Variant PCR , 4 ( 36 % ) were identified to be B . 1 . 258 , whereas no actual B . 1 . 375 was confirmed by WGS . 10 Overall , for the samples with valid results from both methods , the Variant PCR missed no VoC . Conversely , all of the samples identified as “other lineages” ( i . e . , “non - VoC lineages” ) by the Variant PCR , were confirmed by WGS . Table 2 .

From 25 January to 7 March 2021 , the positive rate for SARS - CoV - 2 increased from 2 . 0 % ( 25 January to 19 February ) , to 3 . 1 % ( 20 February to 7 March ) . Within the same period , the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant increased rapidly , becoming the dominant variant within 6 weeks ( Figure 1 ) . Figure 1 . Total number of SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples ( red bars ) , number of samples with the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant ( blue bars ) and % of the B . 1 . 1 . 7 lineage of all positive samples ( green line ) on a daily basis from 25 January to 19 February ( Observation period ) and from 20 February to 7 March 2021 ( Follow - up period ) using Variant PCR . Discussion The rapid identification of VoC is key to control the current SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . In an infection control setting , this information is important for choosing adequate containment measures on an individual and community level . We here show that it is possible to gain this 12 information using a rapid and simple PCR - based variant assay , capable of detecting and differentiating the B . 1 . 1 . 7 and B . 1 . 351 / P . 1 variants in a high - volume laboratory , which we confirmed by WGS on a high number of samples . Overall , no VoC was missed by the Variant PCR and the potential non - VoC lineages were true “Non - VoC” lineages defined by WGS . The Variant PCR incorrectly interpreted several other lineages to be either B . 1 . 1 . 7 or B . 1 . 351 / P1 . Interestingly , all these wrongly interpreted lineages had biologically important mutations and were in fact “variants of interest” [ 21 ] . Sixteen samples defined as potentially B . 1 . 1 . 7 by Variant PCR were B . 1 . 525 , a variant of interest , lacking the N501Y spike mutation but possessing the biologically important E484K mutation . Similarly , for potential B . 1 . 351 or P . 1 lineages found by Variant PCR , several were lineages lacking the N501Y mutation , but possessing the E484K mutation ( variants B . 1 . 1 . 261 , B . 1 . 1 . 74 and B . 1 . 1 . 318 ) . The spike Δ69 / 70 deletion , which is present in various linages including B . 1 . 375 , was found in 11 samples by Variant PCR . Four of these belonged to the B . 1 . 258 , which contain the spike receptor binding motif ( RBM ) mutation N439K , and recently caused a highly contagious local outbreak in Trondheim , Norway . Of the samples defined as “Other lineages” by Variant PCR , 28 were B . 1 . 160 containing another spike RBM mutation S477N , which also recently caused a highly contagious local outbreak in Norway . The N439K and S477N spike mutations have been associated with immune evasion or attenuated immune responses , respectively [ 22 , 23 ] . Vogels et al . recommend each laboratory to optimise threshold N gene CT values for calling target failures in Δ69 / 70 and ORF1a [ 6 , 24 ] . We used the CT cut - off values described in Table 1 and did not have any true false VoC positives . Without these CT thresholds , 41 ( 79 % ) Non - VoC lineages would have been wrongly defined as potential VoC by Variant PCR . 13 A greater proportion of conclusive WGS results may have been achieved by applying a threshold on preanalytical CT input values , as we observed a correlation between low PCR ( N gene ) CT values and successful WGS ( data not shown ) . However , we were not able to derive a simple CT cut - off value for successful sequencing within the scope of this study , and including all samples ensured the maximum return of conclusive results . An important limitation of the Variant PCR assay is that it can only detect a predefined set of mutations . Emerging VoC are not detected and would pass unnoticed without a system for sequencing - based surveillance of the whole viral genome . Nonetheless , careful choice of metrics to monitor sequencing coverage and quality , as applied here , are necessary in order to avoid erroneous and misleading lineage assignment using both Pangolin and Nextstrain bioinformatic toolkits . Whilst a WGS - based surveillance approach is critical to detect the rise of new variants , rapid monitoring of current VoC remains of utmost importance to limit community spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . Variant PCR methods thus remain a valuable tool , providing fast results , demanding relatively few human and data resources , and delivering higher throughput . In our hands , the total result time for the Variant PCR including primary SARS - CoV - 2 RNA detection was on average 9 hours , compared to 5 - 6 days for WGS . There remains a need for parallel continuous surveillance of emerging VoC , with corresponding prompt updates of variant PCR protocols . Still , the current Variant PCR , used within a diagnostic algorithm , can be applied to select samples for WGS . This would enable surveillance of VoC also in countries where WGS facilities are limited . In our case , with a very high incidence of B . 1 . 1 . 7 , “non - B . 1 . 1 . 7” samples from the Variant PCR are now selected for screening for the emerging VoC B . 1 . 617 . 2 and variants of interest . 14 In conclusion , Variant PCR is an effective method for rapid screening for VoC , applicable for most diagnostic laboratories within a pandemic setting . WGS is still needed to confirm the identity of certain variants and for continuous surveillance of emerging VoC .
