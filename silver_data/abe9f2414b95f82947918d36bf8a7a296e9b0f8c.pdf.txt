The GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase ( Graf ) exhibits GAP activity toward the RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases , but is only weakly active toward the closely related Rac1 . We determined the crystal structure of a 231 - residue fragment of Graf ( GrafGAP ) , a domain containing the GAP activity , at 2 . 4 - Å resolution . The structure clarifies the boundaries of the functional domain and yields in - sight to the mechanism of substrate recognition . Model - ing its interaction with substrate suggested that a favor - able interaction with Glu - 95 of Cdc42 ( Glu - 97 of RhoA ) would be absent with the corresponding Ala - 95 of Rac1 . Indeed , GrafGAP activity is diminished ; 40 - fold toward a Cdc42 E95A mutant , whereas a ; 10 - fold increase is observed for a Rac1 A95E mutant . The GrafGAP epitope that apparently interacts with Glu - 95 ( Glu - 97 ) contains Asn - 225 , which was recently found mutated in some my - eloid leukemia patients . We conclude that position 95 of the GTPase is an important determinant for GrafGAP specificity in cellular function and tumor suppression . The superfamily of small molecular weight G - proteins con - tains a subfamily of Ras - homology ( Rho ) 1 proteins , which in - clude RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 ( 1 ) . Rho proteins regulate multi - ple cellular processes , including diverse aspects of cytoskeletal organization and gene expression ( 2 ) . Improper mediation of these functions by Rho proteins is thought to play a fundamen - tal role in human diseases such as hypertension and cancer ( 3 , 4 ) . Like other family members , these proteins act as molecular switches by cycling between GDP - and GTP - bound states , in which the GTP - bound form activates intracellular signaling pathways , whereas the GDP - bound form is biologically inac - tive . Progression through the GDP / GTP cycle is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors , which stabilize the nucle - otide - free form ( 5 ) , and GAPs , which accelerate the enzymatic hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP ( 6 ) . GAPs for GTPases of the Rho family ( RhoGAPs ) contain a ; 200 - residue fragment known as the BH domain that is re - sponsible for the GAP activity ( 7 ) . The general mechanism by which GAPs function can be inferred from structures of p50RhoGAP in complex with either RhoA ( 8 , 9 ) or Cdc42 ( 10 ) . The GAP donates the side chain of an arginine to the active site of the GTPase and stabilizes Gln - 61 ( Gln - 63 for RhoA ) , orient - ing a water molecule properly for hydrolysis of the g - phosphate ( 6 ) . Although this “arginine - finger” is necessary , other interac - tions are also important for GAP activity . For example , the BH domain of p85PI3 - kinase ( BH PI3 - K ) contains the conserved ar - ginine and binds Rho GTPases , but it does not possess GAP activity ( 7 , 11 ) . Although the mechanism by which GAPs down - regulate Rho GTPases is of fundamental interest , the means of substrate recognition is especially important . Cellular regula - tion requires selective activation of numerous pathways , and accordingly , wide substrate specificity is observed among RhoGAPs . Determining how different Rho GTPases are recog - nized by various GAPs is crucial to our understanding of reg - ulatory cascades , but the structural determinants defining these preferences are not yet known ( 12 ) . Graf is a multi - domain protein that binds focal adhesion kinase and influences cytoskeletal changes mediated by Rho proteins ( 13 , 14 ) . Recently , the human Graf gene was found to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia ( 15 ) . Graf contains a centrally located BH domain ( GrafGAP ) , which displays a preference for Cdc42 and RhoA over Rac1 ( 13 ) . We recently reported the crystalliza - tion of avian GrafGAP ( 16 ) , and now we describe its structure and new biochemical data regarding its substrate specificity . With greater than 95 % sequence identity to the human Graf - GAP , this structure provides a molecular basis for understand - ing the mechanism of tumor suppression by Graf . Because GrafGAP exhibits more stringent substrate preferences than the p50RhoGAP , we are able to identify a structural basis of substrate discrimination by GrafGAP , yielding an important addition to structures of p50RhoGAP and BH PI3 - K for under - standing molecular specificity in this family of signal transduc - tion proteins . Moreover , this work sheds light on other RhoGAP proteins , including a closely related homolog of Graf , oligophre - nin - 1 , a protein involved in X - linked mental retardation ( 17 ) .

This paper is available on line at http : / / www . jbc . org 38605 viously ( 16 ) . Briefly , a purified glutathione S - transferase fusion con - struct was cleaved with rTEV protease ( Life Technologies ) , and the components were separated by Superdex 75 - gel filtration chromatogra - phy . Purified protein at 8 mg / ml crystallized in 20 – 22 % polyethylene glycol 6000 , 100 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 0 . X - ray Data Collection— The x - ray diffraction data were generated using Cu K a radiation and collected at room temperature with a RAXIS IV detector ( Rigaku ) . The data exhibited the symmetry of space group P3 1 21 or P3 2 21 , and the cell dimensions of a 5 65 . 0 Å , c 5 91 . 6 Å suggested there was one molecule per asymmetric unit . Because the initial data failed to yield a convincing molecular replacement solution , potential heavy atom derivatives were screened . Three useful deriva - tives were prepared by soaking crystals individually in stabilizing me - dium ( 25 % polyethylene glycol 6000 , 100 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 0 ) with either 1 m M PCMBS or 1 m M Baker’s dimercurial reagent for 1 week , or 2 . 5 m M uranyl acetate for 24 h . Additionally , data from a native crystal ( Native 1 ) was combined with data collected from a second native crystal using a DIP2000 detector ( MacScience ) , yielding a data set ( Native 2 ) more complete and redundant in the lower resolution ranges . All data were scaled and reduced using the HKL suite ( 18 ) , and inten - sities were converted to structure factor magnitudes using TRUNCATE ( 19 ) . Structure Determination— The Hg substructure for the PCMBS de - rivative was determined by SHELXS - 97 ( 20 ) using isomorphous differ - ences with native data , and the other derivatives were solved by differ - ence Fourier techniques . Heavy atom parameters were refined using MLPHARE ( 19 ) , and the resulting phases to 3 . 3 Å were subjected to density modification and phase extension to 3 . 0 Å with DM ( 19 ) . In - spection of electron density maps from parallel calculations revealed the correct space group as P3 1 21 rather than its polar mate . A molec - ular replacement solution consistent with the experimental maps was found using the main chain atoms of the p50RhoGAP structure ( Protein Data Bank code : 1RGP , residues 63 – 232 ) and the Native 2 data with the program AMORE ( 19 ) . All solutions from the rotation search ( 15 – 5 . 0 Å ) were subjected to a translational search ( 15 – 5 . 0 Å ) and , subsequently , to rigid body refinement ( 15 – 4 . 0 Å ) , yielding a correlation coefficient of 58 . 6 and R - factor of 50 . 0 % , whereas the top values for a wrong solution were 49 . 9 and 54 . 0 % , respectively . Calculations with BH PI3 - K ( PDB code : 1PBW , residues A129 - A298 ) yielded similar results , but with a weaker signal - to - noise ratio . A model for refinement was constructed by trimming portions of the molecular replacement solution and adding side chains for residues that exhibited electron density in the experi - mentally phased map . This initial model constituted 60 % of the atoms in the final refined structure . The model was refined in CNS ( 21 ) using torsion - angle annealing with a maximum likelihood target toward the structure factor magnitudes of Native 1 data and the phase information encoded in the HL - coefficients output from MLPHARE . Electron den - sity maps were calculated by combining experimental phases and sig - maa - weighted phases from the model , and the program O ( 22 ) was used for model building . Solvent molecules were automatically identified from difference Fourier maps and added manually . The model was evaluated using the programs OOPS ( 23 ) and PROCHECK ( 24 ) during iterative cycles of rebuilding and refinement . GTPase Activity Measurements— Recombinant proteins were simi - larly expressed as glutathione S - transferase fusions in E . coli and prepared by established methods ( 25 ) . The Rac1 A95E mutant was made using the QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Strat - agene ) , by modifying a pGEX - 4T vector encoding Rac1 and confirming the mutation by DNA sequencing . Constructs for other proteins were produced in former studies . The intrinsic and GAP - stimulated GTPase activities were measured using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay as described previously ( 12 ) . The GTPases were preloaded with [ g - 32 P ] GTP and incubated with reaction buffer in the presence or ab - sence of GrafGAP . Reactions were terminated after 1 min by filtration through nitrocellulose filters , and the retentions of G - protein - bound radioactivity were quantified using a scintillation counter . The kinetics of the GTPase enhancement by GrafGAP were also performed and analyzed as previously published ( 12 ) . Briefly , the g P i release from GTP - loaded GTPases was measured using the continuous spectroscopic assay of a coupled MESG / phosphorylase system . The absorptions at 360 nm of the P i - coupling reactions were monitored during the time course in a buffer ( 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 1 m M EDTA , 200 m M GTP , and 0 . 2 m M MESG ) with 10 units of purine nucleoside phosphorylase at 20 °C , which provides a condition for the G - protein to undergo multiple turn - over . At time zero , a final concentration of 5 m M MgCl 2 was added to initiate the single turnover reactions . The initial rates of GTP - hydrol - ysis monitored by g P i release were determined in the presence of a constant amount of GrafGAP and increasing concentrations of GTP - loaded enzymes . GrafGAP concentrations of 2 , 10 , and 100 n M were used for Cdc42 , RhoA , and Rac1 , respectively , and 50 n M was used for Cdc42 E95A and Rac1 A95E , all of which are within the linear ranges of the absorbance measurements . The GAP - catalyzed GTP hydrolysis rates were fitted by nonlinear regression into the modified Michaelis - Menten equation to yield the K m and V max values of the reactions ( 12 ) . The k cat values were calculated as V max / [ GrafGAP ] , allowing the overall catalytic efficiencies k cat / K m to be derived .

GrafGAP contains a bundle of nine a helices packed together in an anti - parallel arrangement ( Fig . 1 ) , assuming a fold sim - ilar to that of p50RhoGAP ( 26 ) and BH PI3 - K ( 7 ) . The overall similarity of these structures is implied by the successful mo - lecular replacement solution used in the structure determina - tion . Upon alignment of a core portion of the models containing the five central helices , the root mean square deviation of the displacement for 92 a - carbon atoms of GrafGAP compared with p50RhoGAP and BH PI3K is 0 . 88 Å and 1 . 03 Å , respectively , and slight displacements of the peripheral loops and helices are apparent ( Fig . 2 ) . The common overall fold was anticipated by sequence alignment ( Fig . 2 ) . GrafGAP shares approximately 25 % identity to the sequences of p50RhoGAP and BH PI3 - K over the common structural domain . Slightly higher sequence iden - tity is shared with several other GAPs ( e . g . 37 % with b - chimae - rin ( 13 ) ) , but the closest similarity is found with oligophrenin - 1 , sharing 55 % identity with GrafGAP over the BH domain ( 17 ) . The recombinant GrafGAP construct ( residues 161 – 391 ) in - cludes about 20 residues that are conserved between GrafGAP and oligophrenin - 1 at the N terminus of the BH domain . The corresponding fragment in p50RhoGAP is ordered and has been considered an integral part of the BH domain . However , the first 30 residues are not evident in the electron density map , and consequently we believe that they are not ordered ; the same is true of the final 10 residues . Thus , the ordered portion of the structure allows for a precise definition of the boundaries of the BH domain , comprising residues 191 – 381 ( numbers based on full sequence of Graf ) . Notably , a GrafGAP construct truncated at these boundaries displays GAP activity unchanged from that exhibited by the crystallized protein ( data not shown ) , further underscoring the compact architecture of this BH domain . Sequence similarity would suggest similar boundaries for the corresponding regions in oligophrenin - 1 and closely related RhoGAPs . The ends of the BH domain in Graf are stabilized by hydro - phobic interactions that differ in detail to those observed in other BH domain structures . Specifically , the N - terminal boundary is stabilized by the packing of Leu - 193 between hel - ices A , B , and E . This leucine adopts a similar arrangement as is found for Leu - 49 in p50RhoGAP and Leu - 118 in BH PI3K ( numbering as in crystal structures ( 7 , 26 ) ) . However , the leucines in the latter structures belong to a helix preceding helix A , whereas the path of the main chain following Leu - 193 of Graf leads directly into helix A , two residues away ( Fig . 1 ) . The C terminus of the BH domain is similarly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions , whereby Ile - 375 and Phe - 376 firmly wedge helix H between helices D and E . These residues form interactions similar to those found for Leu - 233 and Phe - 234 in p50RhoGAP , but the corresponding local structure in BH PI3 - K is stabilized differently . Two other regions with particular flexibility , showing no ordered structure in electron density maps , are the short loops located between helices A1 and B , and between helices F and G ( Fig . 1 ) . No known function can be assigned to the first disor - dered loop , but the second loop would be expected to become F IG . 1 . Structure of GrafGAP . A , this stereo view of the final 2 F o 2 F c map , contoured at 1 . 0 s , shows the electron density of Leu - 193 , which stabilizes the N - terminal boundary of the BH domain . B , the ribbon drawing colored from the N terminus ( blue ) to C terminus ( red ) illus - trates the overall fold of GrafGAP . Sec - ondary elements are labeled as for struc - tures of BH PI3 - K and p50RhoGAP ( 7 , 26 ) . This figure was prepared with BOB - SCRIPT ( 27 ) . Structure of GrafGAP Suggests Basis of GTPase Recognition 38607 ordered upon binding a G - protein , because the corresponding region in p50RhoGAP is observed to form part of the structur - ally ordered interface in a complex with RhoA or Cdc42 ( 9 , 10 ) . Incidentally , this region in the structure of free p50RhoGAP is also disordered ( 26 ) . GTPase Activation and Substrate specificity— Graf was pre - viously shown to have RhoGAP activity , displaying a prefer - ence for Cdc42 and RhoA over Rac1 ( 13 ) . This preference is confirmed and quantified by measurements of the kinetic pa - rameters for the activity of GrafGAP ( Table II ) . With micromo - lar values of K m , the overall catalytic efficiency k cat / K m of GrafGAP is ; 10 - fold higher for Cdc42 than for RhoA , and about 1000 - fold greater than for Rac1 . Values obtained from these experiments compare well with those for p50RhoGAP in similar experiments toward Cdc42 and RhoA ( 12 ) . However , the lower efficiency that GrafGAP exhibits toward Rac1 is reflected in both a higher K m and lower k cat . To model the structural interactions between GrafGAP and substrate , the structure of GrafGAP was docked as a rigid body into a position occupied by p50RhoGAP bound to RhoA or Cdc42 in structures of the transition state complexes ( Fig . 3 ) . Many of the residues of p50RhoGAP at the interface with the GTPase are conserved between both GrafGAP and oligophre - nin - 1 ( Fig . 2 B ) . The conserved “arginine - finger” in GrafGAP , Arg - 220 , is located close to the active site and would need to reorient slightly to attain a transition state configuration , a change also observed between the free and bound structures of p50RhoGAP ( 9 ) . The proximity of helix A1 of GrafGAP to helix a 3 of the GTPase is also evident , and we noted the possibility for substrate discrimination by GrafGAP based on the type of amino acid found at position 95 of the GTPase ( Glu - 97 in RhoA ) . A glutamate residue conserved at this position in Cdc42 and RhoA appears to interact with the N terminus of helix A1 in GrafGAP . Specifically , an alternate side - chain rotamer places the negative charge of the glutamate close to two un - capped main - chain amides belonging to Asn - 225 and Ser - 226 of GrafGAP ( Fig . 3 B ) . Furthermore , the side chain of Asn - 225 would also likely interact with the side chain of Glu - 95 ( Glu - 97 ) of the GTPase . These favorable interactions would be lost with Rac1 , which has an alanine at the corresponding position ( Fig . 3 C ) . The basis for the substrate specificity suggested by this mod - eling was tested by measuring the activity of GrafGAP toward the single - site mutants Cdc42 E95A and Rac1 A95E . Retention of g - 32 P - labeled nucleotide by the GTPase in the presence of GrafGAP was assessed using a nitrocellulose filter binding F IG . 2 . Comparison of GrafGAP with other RhoGAPs . A , the a - carbon trace of GrafGAP ( black ) is shown in stereo together with the aligned trace of p50RhoGAP ( red ) in the same orientation as Fig . 1 B . B , sequence alignment shows the amino acid similarity between the BH domains from Graf ( residues 191 – 381 ) , oligophrenin - 1 ( residues 380 – 569 ) , and p50RhoGAP ( residues 56 – 239 , numbering as PDB code 1RGP ( 26 ) ) . Residues conserved with GrafGAP are shaded , and secondary structural elements are identified . Disordered residues are noted ( # ) , and residues of p50RhoGAP that are within 5 Å of RhoA in the transition state complex ( 9 ) are labeled ( * ) . Structure of GrafGAP Suggests Basis of GTPase Recognition 38608 assay ( 12 ) . GrafGAP activity toward Cdc42 E95A was reduced in comparison with wild - type , whereas GrafGAP activity to - ward Rac1 A95E was correspondingly increased ( Fig . 4 ) . To quantify these changes more carefully , we measured the ki - netic parameters for these mutants . The overall catalytic effi - ciency k cat / K m for the Cdc42 E95A mutant was reduced ; 40 - fold compared with wild - type , whereas that for the Rac1 A95E mutant was increased ; 10 - fold above wild - type Rac1 ( Table II ) . The dramatic effect of this single mutation is apparently due to direct changes in affinity for GrafGAP rather than secondary effects on GTPase activity , for the intrinsic GTPase activity of the mutants remains unchanged . Changes in K m observed between mutant and wild - type enzymes correspond - ingly indicate the glutamate side chain promotes interaction with GrafGAP . We conclude that the residue at position 95 of the GTPase forms an important determinant of substrate dis - crimination for GrafGAP . The importance of the interaction between helix A1 of GrafGAP and helix a 3 of the GTPase is consistent with the general nature of the movement from the ground state ( 8 ) to the transition state ( 9 ) observed in GTPase complexes with p50RhoGAP ( 6 ) . A shift in the position of p50RhoGAP is ob - served , largely characterized as a 20° rigid - body rotation about the GTPase , resulting in helix A1 of p50RhoGAP dramatically moving 6 Å toward the helix a 3 of the GTPase . In the transition state , Asn - 94 and Glu - 97 on helix a 3 of RhoA form hydrogen bonds with p50RhoGAP , pulling the helix A1 loop close to the GTPase . Correspondingly , in the transition state complex with Cdc42 , Asn - 92 interacts with p50RhoGAP , but in this case Glu - 95 of Cdc42 does not form a hydrogen bond across the interface . Although the interface includes interactions between helix A1 of p50RhoGAP and the helix a 3 of the GTPase , the activity p50RhoGAP exhibits toward all Rho family GTPases suggests interaction ( s ) with residue 95 of the GTPase is rela - tively less important for p50RhoGAP activity than for GrafGAP . The configuration of the main chain leading into helix A1 in GrafGAP is similar to p50RhoGAP ( Fig . 2 ) but is in striking contrast to that observed in the structure of BH PI3 - K . Upon alignment with transition state structures , helix A1 of BH PI3 - K is not capable of similar interactions with the GTPase . The reason BH PI3 - K lacks GAP activity has been unclear , but was tentatively attributed to the lack of a conserved asparagine residue corresponding to Asn - 194 in p50RhoGAP ( 6 , 26 ) . In addition , we suggest that the loop preceding helix A1 simply does not allow the close apposition to the GTPase necessary for properly orienting the “arginine - finger” into the active site . The specific determinants important for binding and GAP activa - tion , however , are expected to vary among GAPs . For example , kinetic experiments comparing the GAP activity of p190GAP and p50RhoGAP toward RhoA show a much greater salt de - pendence for the former than the latter , suggesting the greater importance of charged interactions for p190GAP than for p50RhoGAP ( 12 ) . Despite the variation among the family of GAPs , the high degree of amino acid conservation between GrafGAP and oligophrenin - 1 would suggest similar interac - tions with the GTPase . We surmise that the residue at position 95 of the GTPase might also partially explain an apparent preference of oligophrenin - 1 for Cdc42 and RhoA over Rac1 ( 17 ) . Interestingly , new data support the role of tumor suppressor for Graf . In some myeloid leukemia patients , the Graf gene is fused to the mixed - lineage leukemia gene , losing the GAP do - main ( 15 ) . The residual allele , potentially sufficient to suppress the syndrome , was found to contain mutations , one of which affects Asn - 225 ( 15 ) . This residue , along with all the other residues that would interface with the GTPase , is conserved between the avian and human isoforms of GrafGAP . These observations reinforce our conclusion that the Asn - 225 contain - ing epitope of GrafGAP is critical for its biological function , which is proper selection of the target GTPase . The overall preference GrafGAP exhibits in vitro differs from that observed recently in vivo . Although our data would sug - gest that Cdc42 is the preferred substrate of Graf , the cytoskel - etal changes induced by Graf in vivo are processes thought to be dependent specifically upon RhoA and not Cdc42 ( 14 ) . This would suggest Graf has some other means of distinguishing G - proteins in vivo in addition to the specificity determinant we identify here .

C , amino acid sequence alignment of RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 is shown for a region that forms part of the interface upon binding the GAP .

Structure of GrafGAP Suggests Basis of GTPase Recognition 38609 herent to the GrafGAP domain and does not account for any additional substrate selectivity based on other factors , such as subcellular localization or additional interactions occurring outside the BH domain . These results reveal novel structural features for the regulation of Rho GTPases by Graf and yield insight to the molecular properties of oligophrenin - 1 and other related GAPs . REFERENCES 1 .
