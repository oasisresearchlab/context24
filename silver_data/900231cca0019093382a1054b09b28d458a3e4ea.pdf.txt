ADPr - actin trimer is a short - F - actin oligomer that binds selectively to F - actin binding proteins by Navneet Sidhu A Thesis presented to The University of Guelph In partial fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular and Cellular Biology Guelph , Ontario , Canada Â© Navneet Sidhu , January , 2020 ABSTRACT ADPR - ACTIN TRIMER IS A SHORT - F - ACTIN OLIGOMER THAT BINDS SELECTIVELY TO F - ACTIN BINDING PROTEINS Navneet Sidhu University of Guelph , 2020 Advisor : Dr . John F . Dawson Actin is one of the most abundant and conserved proteins involved in a myriad of biological functions critical for maintaining eukaryotic life . The functions of actin rely on dynamic reorganization of actin filaments , which is modulated by several Actin Binding Proteins ( ABPs ) . Despite the significance of these interactions in regulating actin function , the field lacked atomic details of interactions of F - actin with ABPs until the first decade of the 2000s . With advances in cryo - Electron Microscopy ( cryo - EM ) since 2015 , structural models of F - actin alone and bound to ABPs have been proposed . The resolution of earlier EM structures lacked important atomic details ; consequently , traditional X - ray crystallography remains the mainstay technique to obtain high resolution structures . However , the ability of actin to self - assemble into filaments of varying lengths limits the application of X - ray crystallography . To overcome this challenge posed by actin , a short , non - polymerizable F - actin oligomer called ADPr - trimer was generated . The aim of my project was to generate heterocomplexes of ADPr - trimer with F - ABPs for structural work . A candidate - based approach was applied to determine interactions of ADPr - trimer with purified ABPs ( myosin subfragment - 1 , cofilin and gelsolin ) . Cofilin bound to ADPr - trimer and overcome polymerization inhibition properties of ADPr - trimer and forming filaments , and myosin did not bind ADPr - trimer . Gelsolin bound to ADPr - trimer ; however , the complex did not yield crystals . Therefore , a negative staining EM approach was used to determine the suitability of the gelsolin : trimer complex for cryo - EM structure determination . The EM - micrographs revealed the presence of heterogeneous species in the gelsolin : trimer complex sample . EM work led to identifying a workflow for future EM work in the lab . In addition , an unbiased approach was applied to identify binding proteins involving pull - down of ABPs from cell lysates on ADPr - trimer affinity columns coupled with mass spectrometry ( MS ) . An identified potential interactor , myosin light chain ( MLC6B ) , was produced for biochemical validation of the interaction . Apo - MLC6B and MLC6B associated with myosin bound to ADPr - trimer in pull - down assays , supporting the MS results . Understanding the interactions of actin with ABPs through the application of proteomics and cryo - EM structural determination will advance our knowledge of the critical role of actin and its binding proteins in maintaining eukaryotic life . iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Firstly , I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to my advisor Dr .

The actin protein is encoded by genes that have been conserved over the course of evolution and are present in all eukaryotic cells . Actinâs ubiquitous nature , extreme conservation , and involvement in diverse biological processes highlights its critical roles in maintaining eukaryotic lifeforms . 1 The key biological processes that actin mediates include sensing environmental forces , endocytosis , cell division , intracellular transport and force generation . 2 These functions of actin rely on the assembly of monomeric actin into filaments that can organize into a variety of architectures . Actin filaments can be stable , as in muscle , or dynamically reorganizing to drive cellular processes . This dynamic reorganization of actin into varied filament architectures is modulated by a large array of Actin Binding Proteins ( ABPs ) . 3 These proteins can bind to filament sides , ends and / or monomers and regulate each step of actin assembly and disassembly . Although the role of various ABPs in actin filament reorganization is established , understanding how many of these ABPs interact with actin filaments at the atomic level remains unsolved . Understanding these interactions at a molecular level through proteomics and structural determination will advance our knowledge of the mechanisms of actin filament organization and force generation â processes critical for maintaining eukaryotic life . The insights gained can also be applied to disease management and drug discovery . With recent advances in the field of cryo - Electron Microscopy ( cryo - EM ) , structural models of F - actin alone and bound to ABPs have been proposed . 4 â 9 However , the resolution from 2 EM studies lack atomic details , such as those at the peripheral radius exposed to the solvent . 10 Consequently , traditional structural protein X - ray crystallography remains the most preferred technique to obtain high resolution structures . However , the ability of actin to self - assemble into filaments of varying lengths limits the use of X - ray crystallography . To overcome the challenge posed by the inherent property of actin to self - assemble , a short , non - polymerizable F - actin oligomer known as ADPr - trimer was developed . 11 ADPr - trimer was shown to have F - actin like properties . It bound to ABPs , such as DNase I and gelsolin . Hence , I hypothesize that ADPr - trimer can be used as a scaffold for binding F - ABPs to study atomic interactions . My research goal is to use ADPr - trimer as a platform to understand how ABPs interact with F - actin at the atomic level . To achieve my goal , the specific research objectives are : ( 1 ) Use ADPr - trimer as a scaffold to identify F - ABPs and ( 2 ) purify heterocomplexes of ADPr - trimer with F - ABPs for biochemical and structural characterization . To fulfill these research objectives , two approaches were followed : ( 1 ) a candidate approach to determine interactions of ADPr - trimer with purified F - ABPs ( myosin subfragment - 1 ( S1 ) , cofilin , and gelsolin ) and ( 2 ) an unbiased approach using mass spectrometry ( MS ) to identify F - ABPs from cell lysates bound to ADPr - trimer . Identified F - ABPs were then produced in the laboratory and their interactions characterized for future structural work . This thesis begins by providing an overview of the protein actin , ABPs and structural advances made in the field of F - actinomics . The second chapter focuses on the candidate approach . That chapter includes the findings from the physical and biochemical assays used to confirm interaction of F - ABPs ( myosin S1 , gelsolin and cofilin ) with ADPr - trimer . The work around myosin S1 has been published . The preliminary structure of gelsolin - bound ADPr - trimer obtained from negative stained EM images is presented in this chapter as well . The final research chapter 3 covers an unbiased approach to identify and validate identified binding partners using mass spectrometry . This thesis concludes with a summary of the key findings and sets the stage for future studies . 1 . 2 Biology of Actin 1 . 2 . 1 Sequence Conservation and Isoforms Interestingly , actin is one of the most abundant eukaryotic proteins coded by one of ~ 400 ancestral genes . 12 It has been conserved over billions of years that have separated Saccharomyces , Arabidopsis and Homo sapeins . 13 Homologs of actin exist in other branches of life : crenactin in archaea , 14 and MreB and ParM in bacteria . 15 , 16 It has been postulated that eukaryotic actin evolved from an archaeal cytoskeleton when a relative of Lokiarchaeota , an archaeal cell with an actin gene , took on a bacterial symbiont giving rise to eukaryotic life . 17 Thus , the actin protein was present and may have actively participated in producing the first eukaryotic cell . In eukaryotes , actin is a universal force generator integrated into varied physiological processes which rely on rapid assembly and disassembly of the cellular actin pool . Consequently , during evolution eukaryotic cells developed several ABPs that interact with actin to regulate where and when actin will assemble and dissemble . Various ideas have been proposed to explain the remarkable conservation of the actin protein . It has been proposed that interaction of several ABPs with actin in the cell placed a strong selective constraint on its evolution . 18 As a result , actin has maintained a remarkable sequence conservation from yeast to humans with an overall 91 . 2 % sequence identity . An alternative theory states that actin requires a set of specific chaperonin proteins to fold and such regulated folding placed constrains on sequence divergence . 19 According to another school of thought , the allosteric 4 interactions that exist in distant sites of F - actin and the multiple interactions within the filament places selective pressure on amino acids in the actin molecule . 20 , 21 Moreover , abundantly expressed proteins like actin tend to evolve slowly to prevent misfolding . 22 Although actin is thought of as a single protein , it exists as six different isoforms in mammals encoded by separate genes . The isoforms of actin include : Î± - skeletal , Î± - cardiac , Î± - smooth and Î³ - smooth that are primarily found in skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscle , respectively , and Î² - and Î³ - cytoplasmic isoforms that are expressed ubiquitously . All the isoforms of actin are remarkably similar and share no less than 93 % sequence identity with each other . 23 Knock out studies in mice show that each of the actin isoforms has specialized functions . Interestingly , it has been shown that knock out of one specific isoform results in compensatory upregulation of a subset of the remaining actin isoforms . 24 The specialized functions of nearly identical isoforms of actin have been attributed to two theories . First , selective binding of ABPs to a specific isoform dictates a required function . Second , the localization of the actin isoforms result in different interactions with subsets of ABPs required for the function of each actin isoform . 23 Hence , the interaction of actin with over 100 different binding partners not only dictates the function of actin isoforms , but also imposes high selective evolutionary pressure on the actin sequence to remain unchanged . 13 1 . 2 . 2 Actin and Diseases In addition to being a component of the cytoskeleton and the cellular movement mechanism , actin also contributes to embryonic development , the functioning of cells such as lymphocytes , and maintaining complex structures like neural synapses and stereocilia . Therefore , misregulation of an actin gene can manifest as various diseased states including compromised immunity , neurodegeneration and metastatic cancer . 25 5 Mutations in the Î± - skeletal actin gene ACTA1 are associated with congenital myopathies including nemaline myopathy , actin myopathy , intranuclear rod myopathy and congenital fiber type myopathy . 26 â 28 These mutations can be either dominant or recessive , but most patients carry de novo dominant mutations . 26 Mutations in ACTC , a gene encoding for Î± - cardiac actin , lead to the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy . 29 , 30 Mutations in Î² - and Î³ - actin are rarely associated with diseases . These isoforms of actin are ubiquitously expressed and essential for life processes including cellular replication and migration that are critical for embryogenesis . While any mutation disrupting developmental functions of actin results in a non - viable offspring , some mutations in Î³ - actin lead to marginal effects on actin dynamics causing hearing loss , compromised immunity , deafness and dystonia , and developmental malformations . 31 â 33 Besides the genetic disorders described above , any unusual activation or loss of function of actin can result in pathological manifestations . One example is cellular metastasis in cancer where non - motile epithelial cells metamorphose into motile invasive mesenchymal cells due to alterations in actin cytoskeleton . 34 Other reported instances include the presence of rod shaped aggregates known as Hirano bodies , comprised of actin filaments and associated proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâs and CJD ( Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ) . 35 Additionally , actin has been shown to aid in the virulence of several pathogenic bacteria such as , Listeria , Rickettsia and Shigella . 36 Thus , understanding the complex role of actin and its regulatory proteins can help describe the cause of these diseases and lead to development of targeted therapies . 6 1 . 2 . 3 Role of Actin in Biological Processes 1 . 2 . 3a Cytoskeleton Actin forms a part of the cytoskeleton . The cytoskeleton includes polymers of proteins including actin filaments , intermediate filaments and microtubules in varied proportions . The collective interaction between components of the cytoskeleton allows cells to resist sudden deformation . 37 The main role of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton is to provide structural support and shape to the cells , and to allow transport of proteins and vesicles within the cell . 38 , 39 Actin filaments form three types of structures within the cell : microfilament networks , bundles and periodic actin rings . Microfilament networks form at the cell cortex just under the plasma membrane and are connected to receptors relaying signals to and from the extracellular environment . Actin bundles in association with the contractile protein non - muscle myosin , allow intracellular transport of substances . Periodic actin rings are specifically found in axons where they form cytoskeleton structures along with spectrin that support the axonal membrane . 40 1 . 2 . 3b Motility In muscle cells , myofibrils comprised of thin filaments of actin and thick filaments of the motor protein myosin use energy derived from ATP to create force and motion . 41 Our current knowledge of the mechanism of force generation in muscle is described in Section 1 . 3 . 1b . Besides muscle movement , actin supports motility of cells . Although the contractile machinery composed of actin and myosin is more ordered and stable in muscle cells , the mechanism of mutual sliding of actin and myosin filaments is applicable to non - muscle cells as well . 42 The generation of cellular movement occurs by continuous cycles of protrusion and attachment of the cell at the leading edge , and detachment and retraction at the rear end . Protrusive 7 forces that drive the extension at the leading edge are produced by coordinated assembly of actin filaments . 43 The contractile forces that retract the trailing end of the motile cells are produced by the myosin motor in actin filaments . 44 , 45 Cell motility plays an important role during embryonic development to form tissues and organs and allows immune cells to reach and destroy pathogens and initiate immune responses . In fact , some non - motile cells undergo morphological changes to acquire motile behavior to rebuild tissues upon injury . 34 However , cell motility also leads to certain diseased states , such as the migration of cancer cells initiating invasion and metastasis of tumors and infiltration of immune cells to certain tissue results in inflammatory diseases . Last but not least , microbial pathogens manipulate host actin machinery to facilitate their uptake and spread cell to cell . All these motility processes are powered by the force generated by the actin cytoskeleton . 3 1 . 2 . 3c Cell Adhesion Actin is a component of several cell - cell junctions , such as adherens junctions in epithelial cells . 46 These junctions maintain tissue integrity and are formed primarily by members of the cadherin family of adhesion receptors that are stabilized by the actin cytoskeleton . 47 1 . 2 . 3d Miscellaneous Actin is involved in endocytosis in eukaryotes and budding and fission in yeast . 48 , 49 Endocytosis occurs with the assembly of actin and some associated proteins to interact with the membrane to induce a curvature . As the endocytic membrane moves into the cytoplasm , actin assembly disappears . During the process of cytokinesis in eukaryotes and yeast , a contractile ring is formed by actin and myosin filaments that generate force to pull the membrane into the cleavage furrow , thereby resolving the two daughter cells . 50 8 1 . 2 . 4 Structure Actin in nature can either exist in monomeric form called G - actin or can self - associate to give rise to filamentous - or F - actin . 1 . 2 . 4a G - actin The actin molecule is a polypeptide of 375 amino acid residues folded into a flat molecule that fits into a rectangular prism measuring 55 Ã X 55 Ã X 35 Ã ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . It is composed of two major domains : a small outer domain and a large inner domain . Each major domain consists of two subdomains : subdomain 1 ( residues 1 - 32 , 70 - 144 and 338 - 372 ) and subdomain 2 ( residues 33 - 69 ) , which form the small domain , and subdomain 3 ( residues 145 - 180 , and 270 - 337 ) and subdomain 4 ( residues 181 - 269 ) , which form the large domain . 51 The two main domains are linked by a hinge between subdomain 1 and subdomain 3 . 52 Below the hinge lies the hydrophobic cleft which forms the binding site for certain types of macrolide toxins and many ABPs , and also mediates longitudinal contacts among actin subunits within a filament . 53 A hydrophobic loop / plug ( 265 - 271 ) extends from subdomain 4 of an actin subunit and fits between two actin subunits of the opposite strand where it forms salt bridges , hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions stabilizing the interstrand contacts between two strands of F - actin . 54 A nucleotide binding cleft is present between subdomain 2 and subdomain 4 . This cleft harbors a nucleotide ( ATP or ADP ) associated with a divalent cation ( Mg 2 + under physiological conditions ) . 52 Subdomain 2 is the smallest and most flexible region of actin . It contains a DNase I binding loop ( D - loop ) ( residues 40 - 51 ) which has been observed in alpha - helix , beta - turn , loop 9 Figure 1 . 1 Globular actin . Ribbon diagram of Globular actin with nucleotide ATP shown as a sticks and Ca + 2 ion as a white sphere bound in the nucleotide binding cleft . The subdomains shown in different colors are labelled as 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 . Image file generated with PyMol using PDB : 1ATN . 10 conformations or completely disordered conformations . 55 The N - and C - termini of actin lie in subdomain 1 and much like the D - loop are flexible and often disordered in X - ray structures . 55 , 56 DNase I Binding Loop ( D - loop ) The first crystal structure of actin was determined in complex with DNase I bound to the D - loop of actin . 51 DNase I is an endonuclease that binds actin and inhibits polymerization . Conversely , the binding of actin to DNase I inhibits its endonuclease activity . 57 , 58 Although the complex is found in vivo , 59 the biological significance of this interaction remains unclear . However , high specificity and affinity of the interaction suggests a biological role for the interaction . 2 The interaction between DNase I and the D - loop of actin is through hydrogen bonds , electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions . The D - loop is involved in the formation of extensive contacts between actin subunits along the length of F - actin . 60 N - and C - termini The N - and C - termini of actin present in subdomain 1 possess a high degree of conformational flexibility . The C - terminus of actin participates in intersubunit interactions within the filament along with the D - loop and a hydrophobic loop . 61 , 62 Structural studies indicate interactions of the C - terminus with subdomain 3 of an adjacent lateral ( across - strand ) actin subunit within a filament and with subdomain 2 of an adjacent longitudinal ( along - strand ) actin subunit . 63 The C - terminus is also part of actomyosin binding during the strong binding state of myosin and it interacts with tropomyosin , a muscle contraction regulating protein . 64 â 66 Cys - 374 , the penultimate amino acid of actin , has been exploited to crosslink actin , inhibit actin polymerization , or monitor actin polymerization and interaction with ABPs such as myosin . This amino acid is the only surface - accessible cysteine on actin . 60 , 67 â 70 Labeling Cys - 374 with 11 pyrene does not impact the properties of actin and is used as a tool to monitor actin polymerization . A significant increase in pyrene fluorescence occurs as a result of polymerization of pyrene actin . 67 In addition , Cys - 374 has been a site for crosslinking actin monomers within the filament . Crosslinkers such as ANP ( N - ( 4 - azido - 2 - nitrophenyl ) putrescine ) , pPBM ( N , Nâ - p - phenylene - bismaleimide ) and oPBM ( N , Nâ - o - phenylene bismaleimide ) have been used to study the implications of restricting flexibility of actin filaments on actomyosin interactions and generate actin oligomers of defined length for crystal generation . 71 â 74 The N - terminus is the least conserved region of the actin molecule . Being a part of subdomain 1 and lying on the actin filament exterior , the N - terminal region forms part of the binding site for several ABPs . 75 , 76 Evidence suggests that the N - terminus plays a role in electrostatic interactions during the formation of the actomyosin complex . 77 , 78 The N - terminus possesses two to four acidic amino acids and the N - terminal amino acid is acetylated . The mechanism of generating a mature N - terminus differs for different isoforms of actin . In class I actins , including Î² - and Î³ - cytoplasmic actins , the acetylated methionine is removed proteolytically , exposing the N - terminal amino acid which is then acetylated to generate mature actin . 79 In striated and smooth muscle actins , the acetyl methionine is first removed from the Met - Cys - acidic N - terminus region . The terminal Cys is then N - acetylated , which is also removed . Finally , the first acidic amino acid in the sequence is acetylated to form the mature N - terminus . This specific mechanism of generation of the N - terminus suggests that the N - terminus processing of actin may have a significance in regulation of actin function . 80 The significance of the N - terminus in actin function has been studied . Elimination of the N - acetyl group from actin decreases the negative charge at this terminus and impacts actin - 12 activated myosin ATPase activity . 76 Similarly , a decrease in the negative charge on the N - terminus causes spontaneous bundling of actin facilitating formation of lamellipodia and filopodia ; a phenomenon observed in the malignant cancer cells . 81 The N - terminus is therefore an interesting region where its unique processing has been maintained across evolution . 1 . 2 . 4b F - actin Actin monomers self - associate in a head - to - tail manner to form a single left - handed helix with a subunit rotation of 166Ë . Two such helical strands twist around each other to give rise to filamentous F - actin . F - actin has approximately 13 molecule repeat every six turns within an axial distance of 35 . 9 nm . 82 Actin filaments are structurally polar with a fast - growing barbed end ( + / plus - end ) and a slow - growing pointed end ( - / minus - end ) . 83 In vivo , ABPs regulate the assembly , elongation , branching , severing and disassembly of actin filaments . In vitro , actin polymerization can be initiated by increasing ionic strength . The growth of the filament is dictated by the concentration of actin monomers . The property of actin to form filaments has been exploited to study several properties of this polymer . Polymerization of actin takes place in three sequential stages : nucleation , elongation and steady - state treadmilling . In the nucleation phase , actin monomers associate to form short oligomers to act as a nucleus . During the elongation phase , the actin nucleus grows into a filament by addition of monomers at both its ends . As the monomers add to the filament ends , the concentration of monomers decreases until that concentration is in equilibrium with the filament leading to a steady - state . For a specific concentration range , the subunits added to the plus - end equals those removed from the minus - end , such that the length of the filament remains constant . This process is known as treadmilling or filament turnover . Treadmilling is regulated by various ABPs . 84 The concentration of actin monomers in solution at steady state is known as the critical 13 concentration ( Cc ) . The Cc can also be described as the concentration of the actin subunits above which polymerization takes place and below which depolymerization takes place . 52 Overall , each step of actin polymerizatoin in vivo is regulated by ABPs ensuring that F - actin is formed at the right place and at the right time in the cell . 85 The rate of actin polymerization and stability of the filament depends on the nucleotide bound to the nucleotide binding cleft . As G - actin with ATP bound in the nucleotide binding cleft is incorporated into the filament , ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi . ADP F - actin is less stable and such a filament can be readily disassembled . This process is key to the reorganization of actin filaments . 82 Ironically , the property of actin to self - assemble that enables actin to perform varied biological processes , also renders the protein unsuitable for atomic resolution crystallographic studies . Consequently , structural information about F - actin has been deduced from X - ray fiber diffraction and electron microscopy with recent advances in direct detectors producing near - atomic resolution structures of F - actin using cryo - EM images . 1 . 2 . 4c Structural Models of F - actin The first model of F - actin was obtained in 1990 by fitting a crystal structure of G - actin ( G - actin : DNase I structure ) into an X - ray fibre diagram of oriented F - actin gels by the research group of Ken Holmes ; hence , this structure is called the Holmes model . The Holmes model indicated extensive interactions existing between actin subunits within the strand of F - actin . Interstrand contacts were formed by a loop extending from an actin subunit across to the adjacent strand across the filament axis . Since the loop extended from actin subunit of one strand into a hydrophobic cavity formed by adjacent actin subunits of the opposite strand , it was termed the hydrophobic plug . The Holmes model was accepted as the best approximation of F - actin structure ; however , 14 this model could not describe the structural changes that occurred during the G - to F - actin transition . 52 Almost 20 years later , Oda et al . ( 2009 ) obtained a higher - resolution structure ( 3 . 3 â 5 . 6 Ã ) of F - actin from X - ray fibre diffraction and helical reconstruction of actin filaments oriented in a high magnetic field . Gelsolin , an actin - severing protein , was used to control the length of the filaments . 63 This work revealed the G - to F - actin transition : a propeller - like rotation of the two major domains by about 20Ë perpendicular to the helix . As a result of the rotation , all four subdomains lie in the same plane in F - actin , with this state called the flat conformation . In 2010 , Fujii et al . published a model of F - actin at 6 . 6 Ã resolution , which not only showed the general conformation of F - actin comparable to previous models , but also revealed individual secondary structural interactions , including loops and probable side chain interactions between actin subunits . 7 In the same year , Galkin et al . proposed that actin filaments adopt multiple conformations that can be only explained by an ensemble of different states . They confirmed the structural contacts described in the previous research . 63 In the multiple structural states of actin described at 10 Ã resolution , subdomain 2 was observed in diverse conformations and involved in multiple contacts with the C - terminus of the actin subunit above it . However , contacts between subdomain 3 of the lower subunit and subdomain 4 of the upper subunit within the same helical strand were maintained and consistent within the filament in all the states observed . It was postulated that for the existence of multiple conformational states in an actin filament , cooperativity is required within the filament with the length of a cooperative unit being smaller than the actin filament . 55 15 Furthering their research , Galkin et al . produced the first reliable pseudoatomic model of one of the states of F - actin at 4 . 7 Ã in 2015 . The conformation of the actin subunits in the filament was comparable to the crystal structure of the G - actin - profilin complex . Their structure differed in some aspects from previous models . 54 , 63 In contrast to Fujiiâs model where the N - terminus of actin was quite rigid , the N - terminus in Galkinâs model was disordered and not visualized in the 3D reconstruction . Similarly , unlike the Holmes model , the hydrophobic plug did not participate in making significant lateral contacts between the strands . Additionally , some differences in the residues involved in longitudinal contacts at the subdomain 3 / 4 interface were reported . This model of F - actin placed most of the mutations associated with diseases at interfaces between the subunits in the filament . In view of the models proposed and considering the conformational changes that ABPs induce upon binding , the multiple structural states of in F - actin reported likely results from the structural plasticity of F - actin and not an experimentally induced artifact . 86 Von Der Ecken et al . ( 2015 ) was the first to report a cryo - EM structure of F - actin using data obtained with a direct detector , producing a resolution of 3 . 7 Ã . The model not only confirmed the structural organization observed by previous models , but with higher resolution many salt bridges and inter - and intrastrand interactions were revealed . Like previous studies , the N - and C - termini were not resolved , presumably due to disordered structures . Contacts between actin subunits within a strand ( intrastrand contacts ) were mediated by subdomain 2 and subdomain 4 of one subunit and subdomain 3 of the adjacent subunit within the same strand . Interstrand contacts existing between two strands within a filament , were stabilized by salt bridges formed between subdomain 4 and 3 , and between the D - loop and subdomain 3 of the neighbouring subunits in the two strands . In contrast to previous studies , the D - loop was ordered and involved in several hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions . Similar to earlier studies , it was suggested that the D - 16 Figure 1 . 2 Actin filament is stabilized by intrastrand and interstrand contacts . Neighbouring subunits in F - actin are stabilized by salt bridges ( A , B ) and hydrophobic interactions ( C ) . The central actin subunit is shown in pale cyan and the adjacent subunits in aquamarine and green cyan . Surfaces in ( C ) are coloured from high ( yellow ) to low ( white ) hydrophobicity showing intrastrand interactions . Interactions between amino acids are depicted with dotted lines . Figure adapted from material presented in Von Der Ecken et al . , 2015 using PyMOL and PDB : 3J8A . 4 C A B 17 loop makes contact with the C - terminus of actin ; however , the C - terminus could not be resolved in the cryo - EM density . This observation further suggested that the contacts between these regions are transient . The interstrand interactions were mainly through salt bridges and were not very extensive . As a result , two strands of F - actin were held by a few contacts with large empty space between the strands which is likely required for the flexibility of the filaments ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . 4 Another structural study on Plasmodium falciparum actin 1 ( PfAct1 ) highlighted the impact of small alterations at the important contact sites within F - actin in relation to its functional and structural properties . The cryo - EM structure of jasplakinolide - stabilized PfAct1 filaments was determined at an average resolution of 3 . 8 Ã . PfAct1 forms a polar double - stranded helix and has overall filament architecture similar to mammalian F - actin and shares its fold with mammalian G - actin , possessing ~ 80 % sequence identity with animals , yeast and plant actin . 4 , 87 , 88 In addition , PfAct1 interacts with Myosin A and other associated proteins to generate gliding motility needed for the parasite to invade host cells . 89 Unlike mammalian F - actin , PfAct1 does not readily form long stable filaments and this inherent filament instability aids in host cell invasion and infectivity . 90 The cause of filament instability was attributed to some deviations observed in the amino acids at the intra - and interstrand interfaces , particularly in the D - loop . Since actin proteins possess extreme conservation , identifying such differences between isoforms can guide drug discovery towards specific species and highlights the potential of cryo - EM as a technique for structure - based drug design . During the time of the research for this thesis , advances in cryo - EM have generated near - atomic resolution structures of F - actin ; nevertheless , crystallography remains a mainstay to obtain atomic resolution structures of biomolecules . 4 â 7 , 9 The major hindrance in obtaining crystals of authentic actin filaments and in complex with ABPs is actinâs inherent property to self - assemble . 18 This leads to heterogenous solutions of actin molecules . Therefore , attempts continue to control the polymerization of actin to generate oligomers of defined length and stoichiometry for crystallographic studies . 1 . 2 . 5 Actin Modification A wide spectrum of F - actin modifications have been examined to gain an understanding of structural , biological and biophysical aspects of F - actin . Actin filaments have been modified with biomolecules , metallic particles , and diamond nanoparticles . 91 â 94 for nanobiotechnology applications . Additionally , a strategic combination of chemical crosslinking and polymerization inhibition strategies have been used to generate non - polymerizable , short F - actin oligomers of defined length for crystallographic studies . Since my work primarily involves a short F - actin oligomer generated by combination of chemical crosslinking and ribosylation which is a polymerization inhibition technique , a brief description of these two techniques are described below . 1 . 2 . 5a Crosslinking Chemical cross - linkers , such as pPBM ( N , Nâ - p - phenylene bismaleimide ) , oPBM ( N , Nâ - o - phenylene bismaleimide ) and ANP ( N - ( 4 - azido - 2 - nitrophenyl ) putrescine ) have been used , sometimes in combination with actin mutant proteins , to produce inter - or intrastrand crosslinked filaments . 11 , 68 , 73 pPBM crosslinked actin filaments were first obtained by Knight and Offer in 1978 . 69 Following Knight and Offerâs protocol , a previous graduate student in the Dawson lab produced a crosslinked short F - actin oligomer called the ADPr - trimer . 11 Crosslinking begins upon reaction of one of the maleimide groups of pPBM with the sulfhydryl group of Cys - 374 of one actin subunit . The other maleimide group of pPBM reacts with Lys - 191 of an actin subunit in the opposite strand , resulting in laterally - crosslinked oligomers . The reaction is carried out at pH 9 . 0 19 to activate lysine residues for crosslinking . 69 The reaction yields a mixture of oligomers of varying lengths â dimers , trimers , tetramers and other higher order oligomers . These oligomers are rendered non - polymerizable by an ADP - ribosylation reaction . Careful balancing of the two - step strategy yields pure ADPr - trimer . 1 . 2 . 5b Ribosylation Several strategies , such as chemical modification , amino acid substitutions , and ADP - ribosylation have been used to generate polymerization - deficient actin . Intramonomer chemical crosslinking between Cys - 10 and Cys - 374 , chemical modification of Cys - 374 with tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) or binding of a 2 . 6 kDa actin peptide from Arg - 177 to Tyr - 198 to actin itself , inhibit actin polymerization . However , these modifications introduce constraints in the structure of actin , thus limiting this approach . 70 , 95 , 96 Mutational strategies have yielded non - polymerizable actin using the baculovirus / Sf9 cell system ; however , such mutant actin only generated structures of G - actin . 97 Actin is modified by several bacterial toxins that inhibit protein function and have deleterious effects on host cell functioning . Such toxins include mono - ADP - ribosyltransferases , such as Clostridium botulinium C2 toxin , iota toxin from C . perfrigens and Photox from Photorhabdus luminescens . These toxins add an ADP - ribose group from NAD + to Arg - 177 that sterically interferes with the intersubunit interaction across the two strands of F - actin and inhibits actin polymerization . 98 â 100 ADP - ribosylated actin can cap the barbed end of F - actin inhibiting further growth of the filament . Thus , the interactions between the barbed end of the filament and pointed end of ADP - ribosylated actin remain unaffected . 101 In fact , the crystal structure of ADP - ribosylated monomeric actin shows that the ADP - ribose moiety does not induce structural changes in the actin ; thus , polymerization inhibition is through steric disruption . 102 20 Of the several actin polymerization inhibiting strategies , the Dawson laboratory employed the enzyme Photox to ADP - ribosylate pPBM crosslinked F - actin and purify non - polymerizable ADPr - trimer . 99 Mass spectrometry data confirmed that each subunit of the oligomer was ribosylated . 11 1 . 2 . 4c Short F - actin Studies Dawson et al . ( 2003 ) obtained G1 ( gelsolin segment 1 ) - bound trimer by crosslinking F - actin subunits with pPBM and depolymerizing with G1 . The trimer had distorted symmetry compared to the helix of F - actin resulting from intercalation of G1 between the actin subunits . 72 The intercalation of G1 interrupted several interstrand contacts suggesting a mechanism of untwisting and breakage of the actin filament upon G1 binding . A 2 . 5 Ã resolution structure of a longitudinal dimer was obtained by crosslinking Gln - 41 and Cys - 374 of two actin subunits with ANP . TMR and the actin - depolymerizing drug latrunculin A were used to inhibit polymerization of the dimers . The crystal structure confirmed the interaction between subdomain 3 and 4 in the actin filament ; however , contacts between dynamic subdomain 2 of the lower subunit and subdomain1 of the upper subunit , and the twist present in F - actin was not observed . 73 Sawaya et al . ( 2008 ) solved crystal structures of longitudinal ( Gln - 41 of the lower subunit crosslinked to Cys - 374 of the upper subunit ) and lateral dimers ( Cys - 374 of one subunit crosslinked to Lys - 191 of adjacent subunit of the opposite strand ) . Subtilisin and Kab C were used to inhibit the polymerization of the lateral and longitudinal dimers , respectively . The configuration of the lateral dimer in the crystal did not resemble actin - actin interactions found in native F - actin . The crystallized longitudinal dimer revealed native F - actin - like interactions between subdomain 4 from the lower subunit and subdomain 3 from the upper subunit . These interactions were similar 21 to those observed in previously described crystals . 103 Due to the lack of a third subunit to establish correct F - actin helical turns in the dimers , no possible lateral and longitudinal interactions were present . 68 In the Dawson lab , a laterally crosslinked non - polymerizable ADPr - trimer was prepared and characterized by Perieteanu et al . ( 2010 ) . 11 Crosslinking between subunits of F - actin was introduced by pPBM , and polymerization was inhibited by ADP - ribosylation . The hydrodynamic radii of the ADPr - trimer measured by dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) was comparable to the theoretical values from X - ray crystallography data . ADPr - trimer bound the ABPs gelsolin and DNase I . Gelsolin binding restored the ability of ADPr - trimer to nucleate actin polymerization , suggesting the presence of conformational flexibility in the ADPr - trimer . Conformational flexibility is one of the characteristics of F - actin required to bind several ABPs . ADPr - trimer retained the ability to bind to the barbed end of pre - existing actin filaments , indicating that the modifications do not distort the pointed end of the trimer . Thus ADPr - trimer retains conformational flexibility and both longitudinal and lateral interactions , along with the twist characteristic of native actin filaments . Consequently , ADPr - trimer was proposed to possess one putative longitudinal interface required for the binding of side binding F - actin binding proteins ( F - ABPs ) . However , further biochemical investigation was required . 11 While the research in this thesis was being undertaken , Qu from the Mannherz research group in Germany ( 2018 ) generated a crosslinked actin oligomer with polymerization blocked through the combination of ADP - ribosylation and G1 binding . In this thesis , I will refer to this trimer as heterologous ( het ) ADPr - trimer because the stoichiometry of ADP - ribosylation and G1 binding was not established , differentiating this actin trimer from the homogeneous ADPr - trimer produced in the Dawson lab which is modified stoichiometrically on each subunit . Rather , the 22 hetADPr - trimer was modified only to the point that it activated myosin S1 ATPase activity and bound myosin S1 under rigor conditions while not forming filaments . A preliminary EM structure shows one myosin S1 bound to the trimer . Such a trimer could potentially provide structural insights into stages of actomyosin interaction which remain unresolved by EM approaches . 104 Given the findings from these studies , short polymerization - deficient F - actin oligomers of defined length can yield a stable and functional complex with myosin and other F - actin binding proteins for determining structural details of steps of force generation and actin function regulation . 1 . 3 Actin Binding Proteins An array of proteins called ABPs regulate organization and functions of actin . Over ~ 120 known ABPs are distributed in eukaryotes . 3 This large number of ABPs have likely evolved to modulate the diverse functions of actin requiring distinct three dimensional actin organizations with specific dynamic properties in the cytoplasm or stable structures in muscle filaments . 105 ABPs nucleate actin filament assembly , promote elongation , sever and crosslink filaments . ABPs can be classified into two broad categories : 1 ) monomer - binding proteins , which bind G - actin and inhibit polymerization ( e . g . Thymosin Î²4 , DNase I , and Profilin ) and 2 ) F - ABPs , which bind to F - actin . F - ABPs are further classified as follows : i ) F - actin end binding proteins , which cap either the pointed end ( e . g . tropomodulin ) or barbed end ( e . g . Cap Z or gelsolin ) and inhibit monomer exchange ; ii ) filament - stabilizing proteins , which bind along the sides of the filament and inhibit its disassembly ( e . g . tropomyosin ) ; iii ) motor proteins , which bind and move along actin filaments ( e . g . myosin ) ; ( iv ) crosslinking proteins , which bind two or more actin filaments resulting in the formation of filament bundles , branching filaments , and three - 23 dimensional networks ( e . g . Apr2 / 3 ) ; and ( v ) depolymerizing proteins that regulate the state of polymerization of actin filaments ( e . g . cofilin ) . 106 Although the physiological roles of most ABPs are defined , a complete picture with molecular details of interactions between ABPs and F - actin remains to be determined . My research concentrates on understanding these interactions , focusing on gelsolin , myosin S1 , and cofilin , all of which are F - ABPs . In this research , I used ADPr - trimer as a scaffold to bind F - ABPs and generate hetercomplexes for structural studies . 1 . 3 . 1 Myosin 1 . 3 . 1a Biology Myosin is a superfamily of ATP - dependent molecular motor proteins that interact with actin to produce force and movement . 107 There are 35 different classes of myosin . 108 Conventional muscle myosin ( myosin II ) forms filaments in muscles and non - muscle cells . It is a hexameric protein comprised of two heavy chains and two pairs of light chains . 109 , 110 Myosin is an asymmetric molecule consisting of three functional subdomains : 1 ) the N - terminal globular head / motor domain , which binds actin and hydrolyses ATP ; 2 ) the neck domain , which binds essential and regulatory light chains ; and 3 ) the tail domain , which self - associates to form homodimers resulting in a two - headed myosin molecules . 111 The motor head domain consists of four structural domains joined by a flexible helix linker : 1 ) the N - terminal subdomain , 2 ) upper 50 kDa ( U50 ) , 3 ) and lower 50 kDa ( L50 ) subdomains , and 4 ) the converter . 112 Together , the converter domain and the neck region extending from the head domain form the lever arm ( Figure 1 . 3A ) . 113 Myosin produces force by rotation of the lever arm upon actin binding and phosphate release . The U50 and L50 kDa subdomains participate in actin binding , and are separated by a large cleft that closes marginally upon nucleotide binding and significantly upon actin binding . 114 , 115 24 Figure 1 . 3 Myosin interacts with actin to generate force and motion .

Figure adapted from Gurel et al . , 2017 using PDB : 6BNV . 6 A B C 25 Papain digestion of myosin yields S1 ( myosin subfragment - 1 ) . This region binds ATP and actin , and the two light chains . It has been observed that S1 generates movement in actin filaments in in vitro experiments and is soluble in a low salt buffer ; thus , S1 is ideal for biochemical and structural characterization . 116 , 117 1 . 3 . 1b Actomyosin Cycle In muscles , actin and myosin interact through a cross - bridge cycle , generating force and movement . The force generation mechanism involves binding and hydrolysis of ATP , inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) release , ADP release and movements in the myosin lever arm accompanied by conformational changes in the actin - myosin interacting interface . 42 Upon hydrolysis of ATP bound to the myosin head , myosin interacts with the actin filament in the weak binding state also known as Pre - Power Stroke ( PPS ) . The PPS is followed by release of Pi , transitioning myosin to the ADP state and a large - scale repositioning of the myosin lever arm leading to a power stroke generating force and movement . 113 At the end of the power stroke , ADP is released transitioning to the nucleotide free conformation of myosin bound to actin , otherwise known as the rigor state . 118 , 119 Subsequently , with the binding of ATP , myosin detaches from the actin filament and the cycle repeats . 120 , 121 Biochemical assays detect Pi released during the actomyosin interaction as part of kinetic studies of this interaction in vitro ( Figure 1 . 3B ) . 1 . 3 . 1c Structural Models of Actomyosin Interaction Since F - actin is resistant to crystallization , information regarding actomyosin interactions is derived from X - ray fibre diffraction , cryo - EM , chemical crosslinking , and the use of FRET ( FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer ) , peptides , and antibodies . 65 , 122 â 127 26 Holmes et al . ( 2004 ) described interactions at the actomyosin interface by fitting a crystal structure of myosin - V into cryo - EM maps of actin decorated with chicken skeletal S1 . They reported that the L50 kDa domain of myosin participated in the formation of the interface . 65 Lorenz et al . ( 2010 ) obtained a 13 Ã resolution structure of the actomyosin interface during strong binding using molecular dynamics simulations constrained by an EM map of the complex . Their model suggested that myosin S1 forms considerable contacts with two actin subunits . Regions of the U50 and L50 subdomains and flexible loop - 2 that is present between U50 and L50 of S1 , and the D - loop of actin contribute to the formation of the actomyosin interface ( Figure 1 . 3C ) . 125 Behrmann et al . ( 2012 ) proposed an 8 Ã resolution structure of the actin - tropomyosin - myosin complex using cryo - EM . Myosin interacts with two adjacent actin subunits via several loops through salt bridges , hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions . 127 Following up on their high - resolution structure of F - actin bound by tropomyosin ( 2015 paper ) , Von Der Ecken et al . ( 2016 ) presented the first cryo - EM structure of an actomyosin complex using a direct detector at an average resolution of 3 . 9 Ã . They found that the general structure of the rigor complex was similar to the previously described 8 Ã structure published in 2012 from the same research group . 127 Since side chains were identifiable in their structure , most interactions at the actomyosin interface were revealed . The most prominent myosin - induced conformational change in F - actin was observed at the N - and C - termini of the actin subunits . The N - terminus was completely ordered in the structure and the two N - terminal glutamate residues of actin were involved in the formation of salt bridges with positively charged residues in myosin . Changes in the N - terminus were transmitted to the nucleotide binding pocket of actin , yet the positions of ADP and Mg 2 + were not greatly impacted . Interestingly , the C - terminus was also 27 completely ordered in this state ; however , it did not participate in the formation of the rigor actomyosin surface . It was postulated that the myosin - induced stability of the N - terminus and adjacent regions likely stabilizes the C - terminus . Thus , the role of the C - terminus in formation of actomyosin surface remains unclear . Moreover , with no high - resolution structures of intermediate states of myosin bound to actin , whether Pi is released before or after the power stroke also remained unexplained . Wulf et al . ( 2016 ) described structural rearrangements occurring in myosin maintaining the Mg - ADP bound state which lead to ADP release and subsequent force generation and the rigor state . The structure of myosin bound to F - actin in rigor and the Mg - ADP state at 7 â 9 Ã revealed conformational changes occurring during the transition of Mg - ADP bound state to the rigor state with lever arm movement . Although the Mg - ADP state of myosin bound to actin is a crucial state for actomyosin force generating cycle , only low resolution information of this state was described . 5 Structural transitions induced in myosin upon ATP binding and hydrolysis to force generation were further clarified by Gurel et al . ( 2017 ) . They compared cryo - EM structures of the actomyosin interface in rigor ( 4 . 6 Ã ) and the Mg - ADP state ( 5 . 5 Ã ) with the previously proposed structures of myosin VI in pre - and post - power strokes . 6 Their model supported mutual structural reorganization in actin and myosin during the transition between subsequent states of the actomyosin cycle , suggesting an active role for structural flexibility in the actomyosin crossbridge cycle . Conformational changes in the actin filaments decorated with myosin in various nucleotide states of the actomyosin cycle have been characterized at an intermediate resolution 5 and through pyrene fluorescence quenching studies . 5 , 71 , 113 , 128 Gurel et al . confirmed that the reorganization of the converter occurs from Pi release state to ADP state with the converter adopting a post - power stroke and rigor state conformation . 113 Nonetheless , understanding the specific molecular 28 interactions involved in transitions between nucleotide states , myosin conformation , and actin filament involvement requires visualization of transient actomyosin states that lead from pre - power stroke to rigor state . Owing to the low affinity binding in some states , this task is challenging . Mentes et al . ( 2018 ) described the structure of the motor domain bound to actin in rigor state at 3 . 9 Ã and two ADP - bound states at 3 . 3 Ã . They called the two ADP - bound states as AM . ADP A and AM . ADP B . The two ADP - bound myosin states revealed a distinct position of the lever arm and were proposed to present a mechanistic succession of states leading to the rigor state . AM . ADP A state is characterized by the movement of the N - terminal subdomain of myosin causing the nucleotide binding site to open , facilitating release of ADP . Conformational changes resulting from opening of the nucleotide binding site are transmitted to lever arm movement . The AM . ADP B state represents an intermediate state leading to the rigor state in which the nucleotide binding site is almost closed and the lever arm position is similar , but not identical , to the rigor state . It was proposed that mechanical loads that prevent the rotation of the lever arm and movement of the N - terminal subdomain required to release ADP upon the transition to the rigor state influence power output . 7 Further structural and functional studies are required to achieve a full understanding of specific conformational changes at the actomyosin interface that are associated with different nucleotide binding states of myosin and lever arm movement for force production . 1 . 3 . 3d Myosin and Diseases Myosin has been associated with pathogenesis of various diseases . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy characterized by thickening of the left ventricular wall is caused by mutation in any of the ~ 13 genes that encode contractile proteins of the cardiac muscle ; mutations in the 29 myosin heavy chain gene MYH7 and cardiac myosin binding protein C account for approximately 50 % of all known HCM - related mutations . 129 â 131 Mutations in the skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain gene MYH7 lead to myopathies , including Laing distal myopathy and myosin storage myopathy . The phenotypes of these diseases are diverse ranging from prenatal non - progressive arthrogrypotic syndromes characterized by joint stiffness , to adult onset progressive muscle weakness . 132 Mutations in the non - muscle myosin gene MYH9 has been linked to the May - Hegglin anomaly characterized by abnormal morphology of platelets and leukocytes . 133 Mutations in genes encoding non - muscle myosin VIIA , which plays an important role in organizing actin filaments to form the core of stereocilia in the internal ear , causes Usher syndrome . This syndrome is characterized by deafness and is associated with the loss of vision . 134 - 135 An autosomal recessive mutation in MYO5A , a gene encoding unconventional cytoplasmic myosin - Vb , results in Elejalde syndrome . 136 Patients are reported to have albinism and a number of neurological deficits such as seizures , severe muscle hypotonia and mental retardation . Biochemical and structural characterization of actomyosin interactions can help better understand the mechanisms of diseases and aid in development of potential therapeutics . 1 . 3 . 2 Cofilin 1 . 3 . 2a Biology Cofilin is a member of the ADF / Cofilin family which is expressed in all eukaryotic cells . The members of this family are small proteins that exist as several isoforms with three isoforms being expressed in mammals . These three isoforms regulate actin dynamics in cells and include : Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) found in epithelial and endothelial cells , cofilin - 1 found primarily in non - muscle cells , and cofilin - 2 mainly found in muscle cells . Both ADF and cofilin - 1 have similar roles in regulating actin dynamics ; however , ADF is more efficient in monomer 30 sequestering , while cofilin is more efficient in nucleation and severing . 137 Many studies reported in the literature do not specify the isoform being studied in relation to their depolymerizing abilities because of similar functions of the isoforms and the inability of available antibodies to identify different isoforms . 138 Consequently , the term cofilin is used to describe members of the family , except when specific roles have been studied and described . Cofilin - 1 is generally referred to as cofilin and has been most widely studied because of its ubiquitous presence and its role in embryonic development . 137 Cofilin is best described as a regulator of actin filament assembly - disassembly . In quiescent cells , cofilin is distributed throughout the cytoplasm ; whereas in active cells , cofilin localizes in the cortical regions with a high degree of actin turnover . In the cortical region of active cells , cofilin regulates the ruffling of membranes in motile cells , the formation of the cell division cleavage furrow , as well as the neuronal growth cone . 139 â 141 Cofilin drives filament disassembly by first severing actin filaments and then promoting depolymerization at the ends of the severed filaments . 142 Besides F - actin , cofilin also binds to G - actin in an equimolar ratio that inhibits its polymerization . 143 The role of cofilin depends on the relative concentration of cofilin to actin and to other ABPs . 144 In vitro studies have indicated that at a low ratio of cofilin / actin , cofilin exhibits severing activity while at a high cofilin / actin ratio , cofilin first severs rapidly and then stabilizes actin filaments . 145 Bamburg et al . ( 2010 ) reported that at a higher molar ratio of cofilin / actin ( 1 : 10 to 1 : 2 ) , cofilin severs filaments and because of its cooperative binding , then it binds the severed fragments of filaments and stabilizes them . In vivo , bundles of ADP - actin stabilized by cofilin known as rods are formed during oxidative stress , however a complete understanding of the physiological effect of cofilin concentration on its function is not known . 146 31 Figure 1 . 4 Cofilin decorated actin filament . Cofilin , an actin subunit and other subunits shown in orange , skyblue and cyan , respectively . Cofilin binds to two actin subunits along the length of the actin filament . Cofilin binding induces significant structural changes in the actin filaments resulting in disruption of the canonical interactions between actin subunits within the filament . The changes are cooperatively propagated to the neighbouring actin subunits in the undecorated regions destabilizing the filament . In the decorated regions cofilin maintains the crosslink between actin subunits . Figure generated with PyMol and PDB : 5YU8 . 8 32 Besides dependence on concentration , in vitro studies indicate the influence of pH on the interaction of cofilin with actin filaments . At pH lower than 6 . 8 , cofilin binds cooperatively between two actin subunits along the filament inducing a change in the twist of the filament . At pH greater than 7 . 3 , cofilin rapidly depolymerizes actin filaments . 147 In vivo , the pH dependency of cofilin function potentially stabilizes actin filaments in the vicinity of Na + - H + exchangers . 148 Cofilin is also known to accelerate the assembly of actin monomers . 143 , 149 Because cofilin binds to two actin subunits along the long pitch of the actin helix , it can stabilize long pitch actin dimers that are required to initiate polymerization . 150 , 151 In the presence of cofilin , actin labeled by tetramethylrhodamine at Cys - 374 does not polymerize forms short filaments , perhaps by substituting actin - actin contacts modified by tetramethylrhodamine . 152 1 . 3 . 2b Structural Models and Mechanism of Action Cofilin binding sites on F - actin were first determined at a resolution of 27 . 5 Ã by cryo - EM and helical reconstruction of cofilin - bound actin filaments . Cofilin cooperatively binds with two longitudinally associated actin subunits within a strand of F - actin ( Figure 1 . 4 ) . Cofilin binds axially at subdomain 2 of the lower actin subunit and radially at the cleft between subdomain 1 and 3 of the upper actin subunit . This work was the first to reveal the ability of cofilin to significantly change the twist of the filament that produces a strain in the filament resulting in fragmentation . The filaments decorated with cofilin were shown to have ~ 25 % lower crossover length compared to canonical F - actin . Another interesting finding was that although phalloidin binds to F - actin at a site distinct and distant to cofilin , cofilin and phalloidin do not simultaneous bind to actin filaments . These findings were the first to demonstrate that F - ABPs compete for 33 binding by altering the twist of the filament rather than mutual exclusion that could be attributed to overlapping binding sites . 150 Galkin et al . ( 2011 ) proposed a mode of cofilin - induced F - actin severing based on the 3D reconstruction of cofilin - decorated F - actin at 9 Ã from cryo - EM maps . They confirmed previously described cofilin - binding sites on F - actin and related cofilin induced changes in the twist of the actin filament with the conformational changes occurring in the actin subunits . Cofilin first binds to subdomain 1 of actin and twists it towards the opposite strand bringing subdomain 2 along with it . This rotation causes the outer subdomain 1 and 2 to rotate by 30Ë towards the opposite strand within the actin filament . As a result , the longitudinal contacts between actin subunits within a strand are disrupted . However , the contacts between subdomains 3 and 4 remain unaltered in contrast to altered contacts between subdomains 1 and 2 of adjacent subunits . Interestingly , cofilin maintains a crosslink between the two longitudinal actin subunits to which it is bound , but cofilin - induced conformational changes are propagated into the undecorated regions of the actin filament . In the absence of cofilin , the filament severs ( Figure 1 . 5 ) . 153 In 2018 , Tanaka et al . presented a 3 . 8 Ã resolution structure of F - actin decorated with cofilin and described the mechanism of weakening of inter - and intrastrand leading to severing of actin filaments . They supported the previously proposed idea of cooperative binding of cofilin to F - actin and explained that , during cofilin induced conformational changes , the inner domain ( subdomain 3 and 4 ) and the outer subdomain 1 act as two independently rotating rigid bodies . It is by the relative movement of these two rigid bodies that ABPs regulate conformational changes in the actin subunits of the filament . 8 34 Figure 1 . 5 Cofilin changes the twist of actin filaments . When cofilin ( A ) binds to the side of F - actin ( B ) , the Î± - 1helix ( green ) of cofilin clashes with the SD1 of actin ( magenta arrow ) . Thus , the outer domain shown by red arrow rotates by approximately 30Ö¯ towards the opposite helical strand to rectify the clash . Upon arranging cofilin deformed actin subunits ( C ) into the canonical F - actin structure , clashes between Î±4 - helix of cofilin and the lower part of SD1 of actin n + 2 ( red arrowheads ) are observed . These clashes are resolved by rotation of the n + 2 subunit by 10Ö¯ ( D ) around the helical axis ( red arrow ) . Figure taken from Galkin et al . 2011 with permission . 157 A B C D 35 The mechanism proposed by Tanaka et al . also explains the preference of cofilin for ADP - F - actin . 8 In the first step of cofilin binding to F - actin , cofilin binds to subdomain 1 of the ADP - actin subunit within the actin filament . Since ADP bound actin filaments exhibit larger bending and twisting fluctuations than ATP - actin and computer simulations confirm that ADP - F - actin undergoes larger domain fluctuations , such fluctuations in subdomain 1 permit cofilin to span subdomain 1 and its binding site on the next subunit towards the pointed end . 154 â 156 The cooperative binding of cofilin is a consequence of conformational changes that propagate from clusters of bound cofilin to bare actin segments on F - actin . The conformational change required for cooperativity was estimated to be from 2 to > 100 subunits . 158 â 161 Huehn et al . ( 2018 ) used a structure - based method for classifying individual filament subunits for detecting small variations in the twist of the actin filament using cryo - EM micrographs . They found that the cofilin - induced changes propagate to 1 - 2 subunits , thereby limiting the mechanistic models of cooperative actin filament severing by cofilin . A distinct and abrupt change in twist was observed at the boundaries between bare and cofilin bond actin segments . 162 Although the structural basis of severing at the boundary of bare and cofilin decorated filaments is not known , this model suggested that the abrupt or distinct conformations adopted by neighboring subunits potentially causes disruption of the subunit interfaces . 163 , 164 The large conformational changes in the actin filament upon cofilin binding reinforces the plastic nature of actin and that ABPs can induce different conformational changes allowing them to bind in a mutually exclusive manner . 36 1 . 3 . 2c Functions Directed Movement Cofilin defines the direction of cell motility , which is essential for physiological processes such as embryogenesis , neutrophil and macrophage - mediated chemotaxis , lymphocyte - mediated immunity and wound healing . During cell movement , cofilin influences actin turnover at a plasma membrane protrusion formed in response to migratory stimuli . 43 At the extension of the plasma membrane protrusion , an increased number of free barbed ends are required . These barbed ends are increased by severing of actin filaments by coflin . 165 Additionally , cofilin increases actin turnover by increasing the rate of monomer dissociation from the pointed end of the severed filaments . 148 , 149 However , it is yet to be determined how a balance is maintained between barbed end generation , subsequent depolymerization , and cofilin - mediated depolymerization . 149 , 166 , 167 Nuclear Transportation of Actin Although actin does not possess a nuclear localization sequence , it is known to function in chromatin remodeling , ribonucleoprotein complex formation and gene expression . However , cofilin possesses a nuclear localization sequence and has been suggested to have a role in translocating actin to nucleus . 168 , 169 Homeostasis The role of cofilin in maintaining cellular homeostasis in now being understood . Cofilin can act to correct physiological perturbations by regulating actin dynamics . For example , when a cell is energetically stressed during a decline in cellular ATP , cofilin - actin ADP rods ( bundles of cofilin saturated filaments ) appear in cells . These structures reduce the ATP being consumed by 37 actin turnover . 170 These rods potentially maintain normal oxidative potential and are transiently neuroprotective . However , if these rods persist they can accumulate hyper - phosphorylated tau protein , and lead to neural degeneration . 171 1 . 3 . 2d Role in Diseases Cofilin is essential for actin - based motility which is important for embryogenesis , health and disease . It has been observed that cofilin - deficient mice cannot survive due to defects in proliferation , polarization and migration required during embryogenesis . 172 , 173 Dysregulation of cofilin has been associated with various stages of cancer development including secondary immunodeficiencies observed in cancer patients . Macrophages ( tumor reactive T - cells ) infiltrating tumor cells produce enough peroxide to oxidize cofilin . Oxidized cofilin can bind F - actin but is incapable of remodeling it ; as a result levels of F - actin are increased , reducing motility and suppressing the immune response . 174 Cofilin is also reported to be involved in HIV - 1 infection . One of the mechanisms of cofilin activity regulation by phosphorylation on residue Ser3 by LIM kinases inhibits its interaction with actin . 175 HIV - 1 inactivates cofilin directly or indirectly via LIM kinase phosphorylation . This modification impairs the motility of T - lymphocytes and enables the pathogen to evade the immune system . 176 1 . 3 . 3 Gelsolin 1 . 3 . 3a Biology Gelsolin , an 82 - 84 kDa protein , is the founding member of the gelsolin protein superfamily and includes seven proteins : gelsolin , adseverin , villin , capG , advillin , supervillin and flightless I . 38 The members of the gelsolin superfamily are calcium dependent multidomain proteins that regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . Gelsolin was identified by Yin and Stossel in 1979 as a regulatory protein in macrophage extracts with the ability to initiate gel - sol transformations of actin filaments in the presence of calcium ; hence , they named it gelsolin . 177 Gelsolin is found in all eukaryotes and exists in two well characterized isoforms : cytoplasmic and plasma gelsolin ; and a lesser known isoform , gelsolin 3 . The isoforms are encoded by a single gene and are derived from differential splicing of the same gene product . 178 , 179 The plasma and cellular gelsolin differ slightly in their molecular weight ( plasma gelsolin 83 kDa ) as plasma gelsolin has a short 25 amino acid peptide at the N - terminus ; otherwise their sequences are identical . 180 , 181 Functionally , gelsolin regulates cellular motility and cytoskeletal remodeling . 182 , 183 The diverse functions of gelsolin is attributed to its ability to sever actin filaments in the presence of calcium and then cap the severed ends , thereby blocking the addition of monomers . Alternatively , gelsolin can bind two actin monomers and initiate actin polymerization . 184 , 185 1 . 3 . 3b Structure and Binding to F - actin The mechanism of actin filament severing by gelsolin is mechanical , with the stoichiometric binding of gelsolin to F - actin subunits followed by weakening and disruption of non - covalent interactions between actin subunits . After severing , gelsolin caps the barbed end of the severed filament , inhibiting elongation at the barbed end and resulting in disassembly of actin filaments . 186 Gelsolin is composed of six gelsolin - like domains named G1 - G6 . The gelsolin molecule can be subdivided into two homologous halves , the N - terminal G1 - G3 and C - terminal G4 - G6 . The N - and C - terminal halves are connected by a long linker . These two halves are thought to be the result of a gene triplication with subsequent duplication ( Figure 1 . 6A ) . 180 Gelsolin adopts a 39 closed inactive conformation in the absence of calcium , while calcium activates gelsolin to bind and sever actin filaments . Based on calcium sensitivity , three actin binding sites have been identified by proteolytic fragmentation of gelsolin : G1 binds actin monomer independent of calcium , G2 - 3 binds the actin filament independent of calcium and G4 - 6 binds actin monomer in a calcium dependent manner . 187 G1 and G4 can bind to actin monomers , whereas G2 binds actin filaments . G1 and G2 possess severing and capping ability , whereas domains G4 - 6 confer calcium sensitivity on severing and are needed to nucleate polymerization . 188 , 189 In the calcium - free inactive state , gelsolin folds compactly with G6 in the center and the other domains arranged around it such that all the actin binding surfaces are blocked . 190 The crystal structure of inactive gelsolin in the presence of EGTA showed that the âlatch helixâ , a tail extension with a short terminal helix at the C - terminus , blocks the putative actin binding site on G2 . 190 Since calcium binding accompanies large scale conformational changes , a high resolution structure of calcium - activated gelsolin remains elusive . 191 , 192 Nevertheless , a calcium active crystal structure of G4 - 6 by itself and bound to G - actin highlights significant conformational changes and rearrangements in the C - terminal domains of gelsolin upon calcium binding . 193 Further , with the structure of G4 - 6 : actin , G4 was identified as the second monomer binding site , binding to an actin monomer in a manner similar to G1 . 194 The crystal structure of G1 bound to G - actin provided the picture of the gelsolin - fold found in all the six domains ( G - 1 - G6 ) of the gelsolin molecule and its binding site on actin . G1 binds to monomeric actin in the cleft present between subdomain 1 and 3 close to the barbed end ( Figure 1 . 6B , 1 . 6C ) . 195 In the absence of an atomic resolution structure , gelsolin binding sites on F - actin have been identified by cryo - EM structures obtained by helical reconstruction and difference mapping . To control the rapid severing ability of gelsolin , imaging was conducted on filaments decorated with 40 a G2 - 6 derivative of gelsolin which lacks the G1 required for severing . Gelsolin presumably bound via G2 - G3 to two actin longitudinally - associated subunits along the length of the filament as suggested previously by Pope et al . ( 1991 ) . Gelsolin binds radially between SD1 and SD3 of the upper actin subunit and SD1 and SD2 of the lower actin subunit . 186 1 . 3 . 3c Stages of Filament Severing The general mechanism of gelsolin severing has been deduced from the available structural and biochemical data . Although incomplete , the proposed mechanism provides a basis for future research . Severing by gelsolin begins with the binding of G2 to an actin filament subunit , followed by rapid severing and capping of the barbed end of the newly formed filament by gelsolin . 184 , 188 The steps of the severing mechanism are summarized below : Calcium Activation The process of severing is initiated by activation of gelsolin via calcium binding . Gelsolin has two type - 1 and six type - 2 calcium binding sites . Type - 2 sites are present on all the domains of gelsolin and calcium binding to these sites results in small scale local structural changes . In contrast , type - 1 sites exist at the actin binding interface of G1 and G4 . At submicromolar concentrations , calcium binds to type - 2 sites on G5 and G6 and causes the release of the C - terminal helix latch , subsequently exposing the actin filament binding site on G2 . 190 , 196 Full activation of the molecule occurs upon binding of additional calcium to domains G1 , G2 and G4 , thus saturating the molecule with calcium and allowing for actin binding and severing . 194 Filament Binding In the next step , the exposed F - actin binding site on G2 binds to two longitudinally associated actin subunits within a strand of the actin filament . Subsequently , G2 binding directs 41 G1 , the calcium independent monomer binding domain , to its binding site on the actin filament . 197 , 198 Filament Severing Once G2 binds to the actin filament , severing occurs rapidly . G1 wedges its way through two longitudinally associated actin subunits within a strand of F - actin , disrupting actin - actin interactions along one strand of the actin filament . It is not clear if there are additional steps in the severing mechanism that lead to complete disruption of contacts in both strands of the actin filament . The severing ability of gelsolin segments G1 - G3 is similar to that of full - length gelsolin . 187 , 189 , 199 Filament Capping and Uncapping Although not clear yet , it is presumed that capping involves interactions between domain G4 of gelsolin and a barbed end subunit of the actin filament . It is also postulated that gelsolin contacts three actin subunits during severing , while during capping it is associated with two actin subunits . 200 Uncapping of the filament occurs on interaction of the N - terminal half of gelsolin with polyphosphoinositides ( PPIs ) . 201 A model of actin filaments capped with gelsolin has been determined by information gained from X - ray crystallography , EM and NMR spectroscopy in relation to biochemical data available . G2 binds and bridges two actin subunits along the long helix . It binds to the small outer domain of one actin subunit , the same actin subunit to which G1 binds , and an actin subunit below it towards the pointed end . 200 , 202 , 203 The binding of G1 and G2 on the adjacent subunits of the same strand along the long pitch helix was supported by the crystal structure of G1 : actin with a G1 construct containing the linker between G1 and G2 positioned on the surface of actin . 200 , 203 â 205 42 Figure 1 . 6 Structural and functional domains of gelsolin . A ) Domains have been numbered as described for human plasma gelsolin . 190 Actin , calcium and PIP2 binding sites are shown .

An actin filament with subunits from one strand colored cyan and those from the other strand colored pink ( pointed end oriented up ) . Gelsolin with its six domains ( G1 - G6 ) is represented by circles connected by linkers of varying lengths ( a ) . Upon binding of calcium to G6 , the salt bridges between G2 and G6 are broken and the C - terminal latch helix is released ( b ) . Consequently , F - actin binding site on G2 is exposed . Further binding of calcium to G5 completes activation of gelsolin . G2 binds to two longitudinally associated actin subunits ( c ) . Following binding of G2 , G1 is directed to its binding site on actin ( d ) . Severing and capping occurs when G4 - G6 reaches across the filament and binds to actin subunit on adjacent strand of F - actin . Gelsolin remains bound to the barbed end of the filament forming a cap that prevents actin monomers from being added to the filament . There are two possible modes of capping ( e - I and f - I ) . G4 can place itself on different actin subunits on the opposite strand of actin filament . The flexibility of actin filament could contribute to formation of cap ( e - II and f - II ) . In the presence of PIP2 , gelsolin is released from severed filament allowing polymerization at the barbed end . F - actin obtained from PDB : 3G37 . Figure adapted from McGough et al . , 2003 . 209 e - II a b d c f - I f - II e - I 44 The positioning of the G4 - 6 segment of gelsolin in the cap on actin is not clear . It is generally agreed that G4 extends across the filament axis , with G4 binding to the actin subunit of the adjacent strand of F - actin . Two possible modes of binding of G4 - 6 have been suggested . Most models suggest that G4 binds to the subunit adjacent to that binding G1 and G2 along the short pitch of the actin helix . Such binding requires the G3 - 4 linker to span 100 Ã , which is the distance between the C - terminus of G3 and the N - terminus of G4 , if no significant conformational changes occur in this region upon calcium binding . 186 , 205 Alternatively , G4 could bind to the subunit in the same strand that is above the subunit opposite to the one binding G1 and G2 . In this case the linker would need to span 75 Ã . It is possible that the flexibility of F - actin aids in formation of the capped end ( Figure 1 . 7 ) . 210 â 213 Further research is required to obtain a complete picture of the steps of gelsolin binding , severing and capping . Due to the inability of F - actin to crystallize , no structure of gelsolin capped F - actin has been produced . Here I aimed to generate the first near atomic resolution structure using a single particle approach to gain insights into the interaction sites of gelsolin capped F - actin using ADPr - trimer . Detailing and understanding the mechanism of gelsolin binding to actin will advance our understanding of the role of gelsolin in physiological process and various pathologies . This information can then be applied to their potential role as biomarkers or therapeutic targets . 1 . 3 . 3d Functions The physiological role of gelsolin includes processes that require cytoskeletal remodeling . Gelsolin is generally expressed in all embryonic and adult tissues of mesenchymal and epithelial origin . 214 , 215 Cytoplasmic gelsolin is particularly expressed in platelets , macrophages , neutrophils , smooth muscle cells and osteoblasts . 216 , 217 Plasma gelsolin is secreted chiefly by muscle cells . 179 45 Cell motility The role of gelsolin in cellular motility was first observed in gelsolin transfected cultured fibroblasts which exhibited increased mobility . 182 Later , in vivo evidence was provided by gelsolin null mice ( Gsn - / - ) . Fibroblasts in gelsolin null mice had increased stress fibers , no ruffling in response to epidermal growth factor , diminished chemotaxis and delayed wound repair . 216 , 218 In another study , osteoclasts in gelsolin null mice could not form cell adhesion structures , podosomes , resulting in reduced motility . Additionally , the retraction process in neuronal growth cones from which lamellipodia and filopodia form and retract to facilitate growth of axons , appeared to be delayed . 219 Phagocytosis and Wound Healing A continuous rearrangement of the cytoskeleton is required for phagocytosis . Using gelsolin null mice , gelsolin has been shown to play a role in phagocytosis . 220 Despite the evidence of the role of gelsolin in actin cytoskeleton remodeling required for phagocytosis , details of the mechanism is not clear . Gelsolin is the only actin severing protein expressed in megakaryocytes and is suggested to play a role in actin remodeling required for the formation of platelets from cytoplasmic extensions of mature megakaryocytes . 221 Moreover , prolonged bleeding in mutant mice following an injury indicate that gelsolin is required for platelet activation and shape changes during wound repair . 216 Apoptosis Caspases are a family of proteases that initiate apoptosis . One of the members of caspases , caspase - 3 , targets gelsolin . Caspase - 3 cleaves gelsolin such that the generated gelsolin fragment loses calcium control over its severing ability and activates actin cytoskeleton depolymerization . 183 46 Paradoxically , gelsolin not only regulates apoptosis , but also inhibits the apoptotic process . Jurket cells expressing three - fold more gelsolin were more resistant to apoptosis induced by several stimuli . 222 In an in vitro and in vivo apoptotic pathway study , gelsolin was shown to form a complex with phosphoinositides and caspase - 3 which was thought to inhibit the activity of gelsolin resulting in loss of ability of gelsolin to bind actin . 223 Despite the evidence , the role of gelsolin in inhibition of apoptosis is controversial . Role of gelsolin in development Despite the role of gelsolin in a variety of cellular processes , gelsolin null mice develop and reproduce normally . However , the increased bleeding time due to altered platelet function and inflammatory response due to the decreased migratory ability of neutrophils and motility of fibroblasts results in slower wound healing . 216 It is interesting that despite the involvement of gelsolin in regulating physiological processes involving cytoskeleton remodeling , deletion of the gelsolin gene is not lethal . However , processes relying on cell shape changes and cell motility are delayed , but not abrogated . Likely , this lack of lethality in gelsolin null mice is caused by a compensatory mechanism by other members of the gelsolin family . Further investigations are required to completely understand the function and overlap of gelsolin with other members of this family . 224 1 . 3 . 3e Role in Diseases Since its identification , gelsolin has been implicated in a large number of pathological processes such as amyloidosis , inflammation and oncogenic transformation . 225 A variant of gelsolin ( D187Y or D187N ) leads to a hereditable autosomal amyloid polyneuropathy called Finnish type familial amyloidosis ( FAF ) . 226 The disease manifests as corneal lattice dystrophy , progressive cranial and peripheral neuropathy and changes in skin . 227 The amyloid deposition 47 found in the peripheral and central nervous system found in FAF patients is composed mainly of 5 - 8 kDa fragments of gelsolin . The plasma gelsolin obtained from FAF patients is unable to sever or nucleate actin ; however , the remodeling activity of cytoplasmic gelsolin in these patients is unaffected . 228 , 229 With its role in cytoskeletal reorganization , gelsolin has been associated with acute and chronic inflammatory conditions . Gelsolin null mice show slower leukocyte accumulation , thus slower cellular responses to an inflammatory stimulus in the early acute phase . 216 In rheumatoid arthritis , a chronic inflammatory disease , rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts exhibit severe alterations in cytoskeletal reorganization due to failure of expression of gelsolin . 230 Crohnâs disease , another chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine caused when the contractile smooth muscle transforms to migratory cells , is associated with an increase in the expression of gelsolin . 231 . Thus , gelsolin may be a target for anti - inflammatory therapy . Several studies indicate the involvement of gelsolin in the formation of cancer . A reduced expression of the gelsolin gene by 60 - 90 % has been observed during tumor initiation in breast , colon , stomach , bladder , prostrate and lung . 232 â 235 Gelsolin has been suggested as a tumor suppressor gene in breast carcinoma . 236 , 237 1 . 3 . 3f Gelsolin as a Therapeutic Molecule Cytoplasmic actin is released in the systemic circulation upon tissue damage or necrosis . The released cellular actin can form filaments due to the favorable ionic conditions . The presence of continued circulating actin can initiate pathways that lead to secondary tissue damage resulting in a condition similar to multiorgan dysfunction . 238 Therefore , an extracellular scavenger system which includes gelsolin sequesters and clears plasma of circulating actin . A depletion in gelsolin levels has been observed in tissue injury syndromes , such as acute liver failure , septic shock , acute 48 lung injury , cardiac infarction and myonecrosis . 239 Exogenous infusion of recombinant gelsolin in burn - injured rats completely prevents an increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability suggesting the potential use of gelsolin to prevent inflammation - induced pulmonary microvascular dysfunction . 240 Inflammation and apoptosis in burn survivors results in long term cognitive impairment . Animal models suggest that infusion of gelsolin improves survival of mice with burn injuries by reducing inflammation and apoptosis in the brain . 241 Gelsolin rapidly decreases the viscosity of cystic fibrosis ( CF ) sputum in vitro , indicating its potential use as mucolytic agent to clear obstruction of airways by viscous sputum in patients suffering from CF . The earliest known role of gelsolin is calcium dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton . Studies have now extended the potential of gelsolin as a therapeutic molecule in inflammatory events or targeting to inhibit cell migration as in cancer and metastasis . 242 â 244 Obtaining a structure revealing the interaction sites of gelsolin on F - actin can lead to an understanding of the mechanism of action of gelsolin and its role in pathological states . Thus , gelsolin - bound ADPr - trimer complex was purified for structural determination . 1 . 4 Protein Structure Determination 1 . 4 . 1 X - ray crystallography and Cryo - EM â Complementary or Alternative techniques ? Since its introduction in the 1950s , the field of structural biology has played an instrumental role in deciphering cellular processes by revealing the shape and structure of biomolecules . Moreover , knowledge of the spatial relationship between atoms within biomolecules and their rearrangement during molecular interactions describes not only their design and purpose , but also provides the basis for target identification , optimization and discovery in the field of drug development . 245 , 246 Several structural determination methodologies including X - ray 49 crystallography , cryo - EM , Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) , X - ray solution scattering and neutron diffraction have transformed our understanding of physiological processes . 247 Since its discovery , X - ray crystallography has been the mainstay technique for solving the structure of biomolecules at atomic resolution . To date , over 89 % of biomolecule structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) are derived from X - ray crystallography . 248 Obtaining protein structures with this technique begins with the crystallization of a purified protein homogenous in both composition and conformation . The protein is crystallized at a very high concentration and exposed to an x - ray beam . The resulting diffraction pattern encodes the arrangement of atoms within a crystal and is processed to obtain an electron density map which is used to solve the atomic details of the macromolecule . To begin , X - ray crystallography requires large quantities of highly pure protein to optimize crystallization conditions . Additionally , rigorous molecular engineering , such as side chain modifications or proteolysis , may be required to improve the quality of the crystals . 249 X - ray crystallography has no upper or lower limit to the size of a biomolecule and once the biomolecule is crystallized , this technique can reveal atomic resolution ( 1 Ã and lower ) structural details . However , X - ray crystallography relies on the formation of well - ordered 3D crystals and finding optimal conditions for crystallization is a real challenge , especially for mammalian integral membrane proteins or proteins with large flexible loops and domains . Additionally , cytoskeletal filamentous proteins are resistant to crystallization . Recent technical advancements in the field of cryo - EM have sparked a resolution revolution . Cryo - EM has emerged as a technique to solve structures of non - crystallizable biomolecules at near atomic resolution , especially macromolecular assemblies and heterocomplexes . 250 This technique , unlike crystallography , can be used for structure 50 determination of a wide range of specimens such as single protein molecules , multiprotein complexes , thin protein crystals , viruses , helical filamentous complexes , bacterial cells and thin tissue sections . 251 Cryo - EM takes advantage of high energy electrons to illuminate very thin specimens in a transmission electron microscope . Since electrons interact with the Coulomb potential of the individual atoms within the sample , a magnified image of the sample that contains structural features of the macromolecule is obtained . Single particle reconstruction is a cryo - EM technique used to determine structures of non - crystalline biomolecules by computationally analyzing images of thousands of particles embedded in vitreous ice . Vitreous ice preserves macromolecules in their near native conformation and reduces dehydration and radiation damage in the vacuum of the electron microscope . 252 , 253 Particle image data sets which are a 2D projection of individual molecules are aligned and grouped into homogenous classes based on their similarity . All the image data sets within a class are superposed and averaged . The averaged images are oriented relative to one another to generate a 3D reconstruction of a Coulomb potential density map . 254 , 255 The final structure is obtained by docking X - ray crystal structures of the subcomponents of the molecule or its homologues into the EM maps . 256 â 258 The structure of the 10 - mer yeast exosome complex was solved by docking homologous atomic models of the nine subunit core complex and bacterial RNase III solved by X - ray crystallography into an 18 Ã cryo - EM map . 259 Like X - ray maps , high resolution EM maps can be analyzed by de novo backbone tracing . However , with low resolution EM maps , docking X - ray segments can provide a structure , but fitting should be interpreted with caution as there could be more than one possible location for a given segment . Nevertheless , these low resolution structures do provide some information which can be a stepping stone to a higher resolution . 260 51 Once considered as âblobologyâ , in the past few years single particle cryo - EM has revealed near atomic resolution structures of macromolecules . This resolution transformation was triggered by the development of direct electron detection ( DED ) camera technology and increasing computer power to run sophisticated image analysis algorithms . 261 Moreover , two perceived barriers for cryo - EM of crossing an atomic resolution of 2 Ã and solving structures of proteins with a MW < 100 kDa were overcome as exemplified by the structure of lactate dehydrogenase ( 145 kDa ) at 2 . 8 Ã , glutamate dehydrogenase ( 334 kDa ) at 1 . 8 Ã , isocitrate dehydrogenase ( 93 kDa ) at 3 . 8 Ã and Î² - galactosidase ( 463 kDa ) at ~ 1 . 5 Ã . 262 , 263 As opposed to X - ray crystallography , which requires a large amount of homogenous material and in some cases rigorous molecular engineering , cryo - EM can be performed with a small sample of biomolecules in their near - native form . Since single particle cryo - EM involves computational alignment of several images of an individual biomolecule in identical conformations and computational image analysis can deal with a certain extent of conformational and compositional heterogeneity , absolute homogeneity of a sample is not a necessity . 255 In addition , cryo - EM can be performed with the buffer that is optimal for the biological function of the specimen , thus revealing structures that are closer - to - the native state . Above all , unlike crystallography , which may or may not yield diffracting crystals , cryo - EM provides information even at a modest resolution which can be improved with biological insights . In the case of crystallography , the existence of a biomolecule in several conformational states interferes with the formation of high - quality crystals . On the other hand , in single particle cryo - EM , if the particles have distinct conformational states that can be identified and computationally assigned , then intermediates and various functional states of a biomolecule can be identified . If the 52 conformational differences are computationally unidentifiable , the averaging of images for structure determination can lead to blurring of structural features . 256 Although the cryo - EM approach is becoming popular , it is not a turn - key approach because data acquisition , image acquisition , and image processing are complex and require significant financial investment . In addition , there is no simple objective quality criterion to assess the accuracy of the density map determined , unlike the R - free value used in X - ray crystallography . 260 Undoubtedly , X - ray crystallography dominates the field of structural biology because of its mature methodology , ability to provide high resolution , ease of accessibility world - wide and large number of experienced users ; however , recent technical advances in cryo - EM techniques have ushered in a resolution revolution for generating structures of non - crystallizable macromolecules . Both techniques with their advantages and caveats can be used in combination to decipher the structure of biomolecules and the mechanisms associated with their function . In addition , since cryo - EM images and crystals of macromolecules are produced under different biochemical conditions , the corresponding solved structures could present different biologically relevant states , thus yielding more elaborate structural information about the biomolecule . Given that X - crystallography reveals structural information at an atomic resolution and with cryo - EM approaching near atomic resolution structural determination for non - crystallizable macromolecules and filamentous systems , these techniques together have immense potential to generate thorough structural information on biomolecules that can be extended into disease management and drug discovery . 53 1 . 4 . 2 F - actin Structure : A Revolution in Resolution Filamentous systems , such as actin , do not pack into crystals and thus eliminate the potential use of X - ray crystallography for structural determination . Therefore , the first model of F - actin was obtained in 1990 by fitting the X - ray crystal structure of monomeric actin into X - ray fiber diffraction data from aligned actin filaments ( Figure 1 . 8 ) . 51 , 52 The orientation of the actin monomers within the filament was confirmed later that year by cryo - EM at a resolution of 25 - 30 Ã . 264 It was almost 20 years later in 2009 that high resolution fibre diffraction data ( 3 . 3 â 5 . 6 Ã ) revealed the structural changes that occur during incorporation of an actin monomer into the actin filament and the ordering of the D - loop which is normally disordered in G - actin . 51 , 63 , 265 These features were confirmed in 2010 by cryo - EM of an F - actin structure produced at 6 . 6 Ã using a transmission electron microscope fitted with charge coupled device ( CCD ) camera . The secondary structures such as Î± - helices , Î² - sheets , and loops were unambiguously modelled into the electron density map . 54 In 2015 , a significant improvement in resolution occurred with the development of direct electron detectors . The structure of F - actin bound to tropomyosin with some identifiable side chains was obtained at a resolution of 3 . 7 Ã . 4 Further improvement in the data processing in 2016 yielded a 3 . 6 Ã resolution structure of the F - actin - myosin - tropomyosin complex . 266 Continuous advances in the field of cryo - EM have yielded near atomic structures ; a few recent structures include myosin bound to F - actin in the ADP and rigor states at 3 . 3 Ã and 3 . 9 Ã , respectively , and a 3 . 8 Ã resolution structure of cofilin bound to F - actin . 7 , 8 Although , cryo - EM is continuously advancing and generating structures of helical polymers , the structural determination of filaments by cryo - EM still relies to a great extent on fitting available crystal structures into the EM maps . For example , the initial model of cofilin bound F - actin was prepared by fitting crystal structures 54 of G - actin ( PDB : 1J6Z ) and chicken cofilin ( PDB : 1TVJ ) . Similarly , the model of actomyosin and tropomyosin was obtained using the crystal structures of rigor - like NM - 2B ( PDB : 4PD3 ) for myosin and the tropomyosin structure ( PDB : 4A7F ) . However , with continuous improvements in imaging and data processing technology , cryo - EM is emerging as the most practical method for high resolution structural determination of helical polymers . 1 . 4 . 3 Chronological Overview of My Research F - actin is one of the major components of cytoskeleton and muscle contractile machinery . Although the crystal structure of monomeric actin was solved in 1990 , information on some molecular interactions within F - actin and with ABPs were available only at low resolutions of 6 . 6 and 10 Ã until 2015 . 51 , 54 , 55 Several crystallizable short F - actin oligomers ( SFAO ) were produced by chemical modifications for crystallization . Although some interactions between the actin subunits within SFAO were preserved , chemical modifications distorted some interfaces . 72 , 73 , 103 Thus , a strategically balanced chemical modification approach that retains F - actin like interactions within a SFAO was required . In 2010 , the application of such an approach in the Dawson lab resulted in the generation of a short F - actin oligomer called the ADPr - trimer . This trimer exhibited some F - actin like properties and thus had the potential to act as a scaffold to bind F - ABPs for structural insights . X - ray crystallography being the mainstay technique for structural determination , my graduate research began in the summer of 2015 with the goal of generating heterocomplexes of ADPr - trimer with F - ABPs for crystal trials . That same year , with the availability of direct electron detectors in the field of cryo - EM , the first near atomic resolution structure of F - actin in complex with tropomyosin was published by Von Der Ecken et al . 267 Since then , several other near atomic resolution cryo - EM structures of F - actin itself and in complex with ABPs have been published ( Supplementary Table 1 . 2 ) . My 55 Figure 1 . 8 Timeline showing improvement in the resolution of cryo - EM structures of F - actin itself and in complex with ABPs . Until the second decade of the 21 st century , cryo - EM F - actin structures were produced from imaging samples with transmission electron microscopes fitted with charge coupled devices ( CCD ) . The introduction of direct electron devices ( DED ) revolutionized the field and allowed generation of structures of filamentous protein at near atomic resolution . The first F - actin structure using DED was produced at 4 . 7 Ã . Since then , improvements in data processing and resolution have provided structural insights into interaction within and with the actin filament . 56 research began with establishing if the F - ABPs myosin , gelsolin or cofilin bound to ADPr - trimer . Myosin and gelsolin were available in our lab , while cofilin was produced in collaboration with SignalChem Biotech Inc . , Richmond , BC . The findings from these three ABPs are described in Chapter 2 . Among the three F - ABPs , gelsolin yielded a complex with ADP - trimer which was purified for setting - up crystal trials in collaboration with the Kimber laboratory , University of Guelph . Unfortunately , the complex failed to yield crystals . With no high - resolution structure of gelsolin bound F - actin available , in 2017 I explored cryo - EM for structural determination . In collaboration with the Khursigara laboratory , I determined a pipeline for cryo - EM based structural work at Guelph . The stability and homogeneity of the gelsolin bound ADPr - trimer complex for future cryo - EM , was determined by analysing negatively stained images of the complex generated on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope at the Molecular and Cellular Imaging Facility , University of Guelph . Approximately 600 negatively stained EM micrographs were collected and analyzed using EMAN2 . With the preliminary structural data from negative stained micrographs , a collaboration will be established with the Rubinstein laboratory at the University of Toronto for structural determination using cryo - EM . Thus , my graduate work not only characterized interactions of selected F - ABPs with ADPr - trimer , but also laid a foundation for incorporating advances in the field of cryo - EM for structural determination . Additionally , my research also included advances in mass spectrometry - based proteomics . Rather than using individual F - ABPs , mass spectrometry was used to identify F - ABPs retained on affinity resins in pull - down assays from zebrafish embryo cell lysates and the interactions of identified F - ABPs were validated biochemically . Findings from mass spectrometry and validation of MLC6B as an identified ADPr - trimer binding partner are included in Chapter 3 . 57 2 CHARACTERIZATION OF ADPR - TRIMER â F - ABP INTERACTIONS 2 . 1 Overview F - ABPs purified in - house or commercially available were screened for interactions with ADPr - trimer using physical and biochemical assays . The three F - ABPs examined were myosin S1 ïª , cofilin and gelsolin of which the first two are side - binding and the last is barbed end - binding . ADPr - trimer did not interact with or activate myosin S1 . Neither remodeling of ADPr - trimer with gelsolin , nor alternative means of inhibiting polymerization of PBM - crosslinked F - actin - derived trimers rescued myosin binding . Gelsolin bound to ADPr - trimer and the resulting complex ( GSFL : 3mr ) was purified for structural determination ; however , the complex failed to crystallize . Thus , an EM approach was undertaken to gain structural insights . Analysis of negative stained EM images suggested the presence of heterogenous species of the GSFL : 3mr complex in the sample . Cofilin also bound to ADPr - trimer ; however , cofilin binding overcame polymerization inhibition resulting in filament formation . Consequently , cofilin binding yielded a non - crystallizable complex . Considering that a large number of ABPs exist , application of the candidate approach is limited only to purified F - ABPs ; however , purified proteins yield clear results in physical and biochemical assays . Upon confirmation of an interaction , complexes can be readily purified for structural studies . ïª Myosin S1 work included in this chapter has been published . Sidhu , N . and Dawson , J . A crosslinked and ribosylated actin trimer does not interact productively with myosin . Biochem . Cell Biol . 97 , 140 - 147 ( 2018 ) . 58 2 . 2 Myosin S1 is an ADPr - trimer non - interacting F - actin binding protein 2 . 2 . 1 Background ADPr - trimer possessing both F - actin - like longitudinal ( intrastrand ) and lateral ( interstrand ) interfaces bound DNase I at the pointed end or gelsolin at the barbed end . 11 I extended these studies to determine the interaction of ADPr - trimer with the side - binding and force - generating protein myosin S1 . Since F - actin cannot be crystallized , the molecular details of binding interactions between F - actin and myosin have most recently come from cryo - EM . 5 â 7 , 125 , 127 , 266 Although cryo - EM structures reveal near atomic details , the current resolution for routinely solved structures is not sufficient to differentiate amino acids with small side chains or reveal small molecules in complexes such as water molecules and other small ligands . 10 , 245 , 262 Thus , production of a crystallizable complex of ADPr - trimer with myosin S1 is valuable for an atomic resolution understanding of the actomyosin binding interface during force generation and movement . Moreover , this knowledge can be applied to studying mutations in actin and myosin that lead to diseases . 2 . 2 . 2 Experimental Procedures 2 . 2 . 2a Reagents Reagents were purchased from either Sigma - Aldrich ( ST . Louis , MO ) or Fischer Scientific ( Mississauga , ON ) . Chromatographic columns were obtained by GE Healthcare ( Piscataway , NJ ) . Protein purification was performed on AKTA pure FPLC system . Membrane filters for protein concentration were procured from Millipore ( Billerica , MA ) . SDS - PAGE gels were made using a 29 : 1 bisacrylamide which was obtained from Bio - Rad ( Hercules , CA ) . 59 2 . 2 . 2b Protein Preparation 2 . 2 . 2b ( i ) Preparation of Actin Actin was extracted from ground turkey breast ( muscle ) as described by Spudich and Watt 1971 . 268 The actin concentration was measured either from absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 26 , 040 M - 1 cm - 1 or Bradford colorimetric assay using Bio - Rad Protein Assay dye reagent concentrate ( Hercules , CA ) . Actin purified in G - buffer was flash frozen in N 2 ( l ) and stored at - 80â . 2 . 2 . 2b ( ii ) Preparation of ADPr - trimer ADPr - trimer was prepared from Î± - skeletal actin extracted from turkey following the method described by Perieteanu et al . ( 2010 ) with slight a modification . 11 , 268 The actin extraction from the acetone powder in G - buffer without Î² - ME was followed by polymerization and crosslinking with subsequent paracrystallization step . Chemical crosslinking of the extracted turkey actin was initiated by adjusting the solution to a final concentration of 10 mM sodium tetraborate pH 9 . 0 and a 1 . 5 - fold molar excess of a 25 mM stock solution of pPBM ( Aldrich Chemical Company P2 , 398 - 9 ) dissolved in dimethylformamide ( DMF ) . The reaction was terminated after 30 min by the addition of 160 - fold molar excess of Î² - ME relative to pPBM . The crosslinking step was followed by the addition of 100 mM MgCl 2 to form large paracrystals that can be harvested at 16 , 000 rpm ( 38 , 400 x g ) using larger - volume bottles in a JLA 16 . 250 rotor ( Beckman ) . The resulting pellet was resuspended and dialysed extensively against G - buffer for five to six days with at least eight exchanges of G - buffer . Any remaining F - actin was removed by centrifugation at 167 , 424 x g for 75 min . The resulting depolymerized crosslinked actin oligomers in the supernatant were rendered non - polymerizable by ribosylating Arg - 177 using an enzyme , Photox ( described below ) . The solution was raised to a 60 final concentration of 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 . The Photox reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 to 200 nM ( 1 % v / v ) of Photox and 5 - fold molar excess of Î² - NAD ( Sigma Aldrich , N1511 ) . The reaction was carried out overnight at 4â . 11 Polymerizable oligomers were removed by addition of polymerization salts ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM ATP ) with subsequent centrifugation at 167 , 424 x g for 75 min . The resulting supernatant was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 200 ( 26 / 600 ) column pre - equilibrated with Super - G buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 25 mM PMSF ( phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) , 0 . 2 mM NaN 3 , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 mM Î² - ME ) . Elution fractions containing ADPr - trimer and ADPr - dimer were pooled ; ADPr - trimer was resolved by iterative purifications on the S200 column . Although the process is labour intensive , I obtained pure ADPr - trimer at a yield of 1 - 2 % of the starting actin . The concentration of ADPr - trimer was determined using Bio - Rad Protein Assay dye reagent ( Hercules , CA ) . Purified ADPr - trimer was flash frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at - 80â ( Figure 2 . 1 ) . 2 . 2 . 2b ( iii ) Preparation of Photox Photox was purified as described by Visschedyk et al . 99 Photox with an N - terminal His 6 - tag was expressed from glycerol stocks of E . coli Rosetta competent cells . Purification was performed by solubilization of Photox in GdnHCl ( guanidine hydrochloride ) followed by metal affinity chromatography . Protein was renatured on the affinity column by excluding the GdnHCl from the elution buffers . The purified Photox was dialysed against binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 , 50 mM NaCl ) and concentrated to 0 . 2 â 1 mg / mL . The protein was flash frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at - 80â . Photox concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 30 , 820 M - 1 cm - 1 . 99 Photox activity was confirmed by adding 5 to 10 fold - 61 Figure 2 . 1 Purification of ADPr - trimer .

A B 62 molar excess of etheno - NAD + ( Sigma Aldrich N2630 ) to G - actin and measuring fluorescence change with a CARY Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer ( Varian , Mississauga , ON ) at an excitation wavelength of 305 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm ( Figure 2 . 2 ) . 2 . 2 . 2b ( iv ) Preparation of Myosin S1 Myosin S1 was prepared by papain digestion of full - length myosin ( FL myosin ) . FL myosin was extracted from rabbit soleus muscle from freshly - killed New Zealand rabbits obtained from Abate Rabbit Packers ( Arthur , ON ) . 116 FL myosin was dialysed overnight against Solution A ( 200 mM ammonium acetate , pH 7 . 2 , 2 mM EDTA ( ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ) . Dialyzed myosin was diluted to 10 mg / mL , incubated at RT for 60 min and digested with 0 . 03 mg / mL of papain at RT for 8 min . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mM iodoacetic acid and spun at 213 , 102 x g for 15 min . The supernatant containing soluble myosin S1 was dialysed into the starting buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM DTT ( dithiothreitol ) , 2 mM EDTA ) and further purified on a HiTrap DEAE 5 mL column ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) equilibrated in the starting buffer . Myosin S1 was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0 . 5 M KCl in the starting buffer . The elution fractions were pooled , stabilized with 3 mg sucrose / mL of myosin S1 , flash frozen and stored at - 80â . Protein concentrations were determined using absorbance at 280 nm and the extinction coefficient of 0 . 72 mg mL - 1 cm - 1 . The ability of myosin S1 to bind and release from F - actin was tested with a deadheading experiment in which active myosin S1 is released from F - actin upon the addition of ATP , while inactive myosin S1 remains bound ( Figure 2 . 3 ) . 2 . 2 . 2b ( v ) Preparation of Full - length Gelsolin Full - length gelsolin ( GSFL ) was expressed and purified as described by Morrison and Dawson 2007 . 58 E coli cells expressing GSFL were lysed in lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM Î² - ME , 1 mM benzamidine , and 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) using a French press at 16 , 000 63 psi . The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 31 , 360 x g for 30 min . The supernatant was developed on an 80 mL Affi - Gel Blue column ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) pre - equilibrated with TE buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA ) using a linear gradient to 1 M NaCl in TE buffer . GSFL - containing fractions were pooled and dialysed overnight against TE buffer containing 1 mM Î² - ME . Dialysed GSFL was applied to an 8 mL Mono Q 10 / 10 column ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) and eluted with a linear gradient to 1 M NaCl in TE buffer . The fractions containing GSFL were pooled and dialysed against TE buffer with 1 mM Î² - ME and stored at - 80â after flash freezing in liquid N 2 . Protein concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 and using the extinction coefficient of 1 . 4 mg mL - 1 cm - 1 ( Figure 2 . 4 ) . 2 . 2 . 2b ( vi ) Preparation of Gelsolin bound ADPr - trimer Gelsolin - bound ADPr - trimer ( GSFL : 3mr ) was produced by incubating GSFL dialysed in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM Î² - ME ) with ADPr - trimer in a 1 . 4 molar ratio for 2 hours on ice . The resulting reaction mixture was developed on a Superdex - 200 ( 10 / 300 ) column preequilibrated in Super G - buffer . The elution fractions were run on a native gel with GSFL or ADPr - trimer alone as controls . The fractions corresponding to GSFL : 3mr complex were pooled , stored at 4â and used within 1 - 2 days of preparation ( Figure 2 . 5 ) . 2 . 2 . 2b ( vii ) Purification of DNase I DNase I purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corporation ( Lakewood , NJ ) was further purified on Superdex 200 ( 26 / 600 ) in Super G - buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM Î² - ME ) . Purified DNase I was dialysed against G - buffer , flash frozen in N 2 ( l ) and stored at - 80â . 64 Figure 2 . 2 10 % SDS - PAGE gel of purification of Photox .

The column was washed and eluted in step gradient with buffers containing 5 mM imidazole ( Wash BB ) , 20 mM imidazole wash , 40 mM imidazole and 100 mM Imidazole ( Elution buffer ) . Wash fractions with 20 , 40 and 100 mM imidazole in the buffer contained Photox ( 46 kDa ) . Fractions with Photox were pooled , concentrated and stored at - 80â . The activity of Photox was confirmed by adding etheno - NAD + to G - actin and measuring change in fluorescence on CARY Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer ( data not shown ) . 65 Figure 2 . 3 Purification of myosin S1 .

Reactions containing GSFL and ADPr - trimer in 1 . 4 molar ratio were incubated on ice for 60 min and run on a Superdex 200 ( 10 / 300 ) column . A band shift in the elution fractions indicated formation of GSFL : 3mr complex . GSFL alone and ADPr - trimer alone were run as controls . 68 2 . 2 . 2b ( viii ) Preparation of D : trimer Since the DNase I - binding loop of actin participates in intrastrand interactions between F - actin subunits , only the pointed end subunits are available to DNase I - binding . To prepare DNase I - capped pPBM - crosslinked trimer , F - actin was crosslinked with pPBM under conditions described previously for the production of ADPr - trimer . 11 Crosslinked actin was pelleted by centrifugation at 392 , 000 x g for 20 min . The pelleted F - actin was resuspended in F - buffer ( 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 1 mM Î² - ME ) . Resuspended F - actin was then incubated with DNase I ( Worthington ) at a 1 : 1 actin subunit : DNase I molecular ratio overnight at 4â . The next day the reaction was centrifuged again at 392 , 000 x g for 20 min to remove any filamentous actin . The resulting supernatant was concentrated and resolved on a Superdex S200 ( 10 / 300 ) column in Super G - buffer . The elution fractions were run on native - and SDS - PAGE to identify fractions with pure D : trimer .

S1 binding with ADPr - trimer on native gels was performed with reactions containing 2 Î¼M of ADPr - monomer , ADPr - dimer , or ADPr - trimer incubated for 20 min on ice in the presence of 0 . 87 Î¼M myosin S1 in Super G - buffer containing 60 Î¼g / mL each of antipain , leupeptin , TLCK ( tosyl - L - lysyl - chloromethane hydrochloride ) , and TPCK ( tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone ) protease inhibitors . Likewise , GSFL : 3mr and myosin S1 reactions containing 0 . 23 Î¼M of ADPr - monomer , or GSFL : 3mr complex were incubated for 15 min on ice in the presence of 0 . 20 Î¼M myosin S1 in Super G - buffer with 24 Î¼g / mL each of antipain , leupeptin , TLCK , and TPCK protease inhibitors . D : trimer and myosin S1 binding reactions for native - PAGE contained 0 . 42 Î¼M of DNase I - capped actin dimer or trimer in the presence or absence of 0 . 37 Î¼M myosin S1 . 33 Î¼g / mL antipain , leupeptin , TLCK and TPCK protease inhibitors were added to the reactions . DNase I alone was also run as a control to identify the band and rule out an interaction of myosin S1 with DNase I . Native gels were run at a low voltage ( < 60 V ) on ice and visualized with either Coomassie Brilliant Blue R - 250 ( Sigma Aldrich ) or Silver Staining kit ( Pierce TM Silver Stain Kit ) . 2 . 2 . 2c ( iii ) Analytical Size - Exclusion Chromatography Analytical size - exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 ( 10 / 300 ) . analytical chromatography column equilibrated in Super G - buffer with protease inhibitors . ADPr - trimer and myosin S1 reactions contained 2 Î¼M ADPr - trimer and 0 . 87 Î¼M myosin S1 or 2 Î¼M ADPr - trimer in Super G - buffer with TLCK , TPCK , leupeptin and antipain at a final concentration of 0 . 60 Î¼g / mL incubated for 60 min at RT ( room temperature ) . 71 For GSFL : 3mr and myosin S1 reactions , mixtures containing 0 . 9 Î¼mol GSFL : 3mr and 0 . 8 Î¼mol myosin S1 were analyzed . Elution fractions were run on native - and SDS - PAGE . The bands were visualized with Silver stain ( Pierce TM Silver Stain Kit ) . 2 . 2 . 2c ( iv ) Dynamic Light Scattering ADPr - trimer and myosin S1 were filtered through a Millipore 0 . 22 Î¼M filter ( Billerica , MA ) . Molar concentrations were adjusted using filtered Super G - buffer . Hydrodynamic radii measurements of samples containing 4 Î¼M ADPr - trimer ( side - binding sites ) and 1 . 5 Î¼M myosin S1 were performed on a Nano S Zetasizer ( Malvern , U . K . ) equipped with a 633 nm red laser and a 173Ë backscatter detector . Apparent Stokes radii of the samples were determined by a normal distribution fit of volume distribution measurements . 2 . 2 . 2d Biochemical Assays 2 . 2 . 2d ( i ) Myosin ATPase Assay The myosin ATPase assay is a colorimetric assay that measures the ATPase activity of myosin in the presence of actin . The assay is based on the production of a blue by - product released by the reaction between Pi ( inorganic phosphate ) and molybdate and was modified from Trybus ( 2000 ) for a 96 - well format as described in Liu et al . ( 2017 ) . 270 Single concentration assays with 1 . 5 Î¼M actin on a per - subunit basis for ADPr - trimer in the presence of 0 . 125 Î¼M myosin were performed in triplicate with released Pi measured at 10 minute time intervals . The average ATPase activity was plotted using Prism 7 . 0c software ( GraphPad , LaJolla , California ) . F - actin was run as a positive control and ADPr - monomer and dimer , which do not possess a putative myosin binding site , were run as negative controls . Myosin basal activity was determined by running myosin alone and was used to baseline Pi released measured in all the reactions . For generating F - actin , purified turkey actin was mixed in a 1000 : 1 molar ratio with gelsolin and incubated at RT for 10 min to 72 control filament length / viscosity . Polymerization was induced by addition of 10x Assay Buffer ( 750 mM KCl , 100 mM imidazole , pH 7 , 10 mM DTT , 10 mM EGTA , 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM NaN 3 ) and the reaction was incubated at RT for 30 min . Working samples were made by diluting polymerized stock with 1x Assay Buffer and Mg - ATP mix . A 2x myosin working solution was prepared in 1x Assay Buffer . Reactions were initiated by addition of myosin to F - actin and test samples . The reactions were stopped at 10 min time intervals for 30 min by transferring 45 Î¼L of reaction to wells containing 45 Î¼L of stop solution ( 60 mM EDTA , pH 6 . 5 , 6 . 6 % SDS ) . 200 Î¼L of colour developing reagent ( 0 . 5 % ferrous sulfate , 25 % of 2 % ammonium molybdate in 4 N H 2 SO 4 ) was added to the stopped reaction wells to visualize Pi production . Pi reacts with molybdate to produce blue by - product that is measured at 750 nm for quantification . Phosphate standards ranging from 0 . 05 mM to 2 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate were used to generate a standard curve for each assay . ATPase activity of myosin in presence of GSFL : 3mr and D : trimer interaction was measured as described above for ADPr - trimer . However , due to low yield of GSFL : 3mr , the assays were performed with a single concentration of 1 . 5 Î¼M actin on a subunit basis with released Pi measured at 40 and 60 mins for GSFL : 3mr and 20 , 40 and 60 mins for D : trimer . 2 . 2 . 3 Results 2 . 2 . 3a Myosin does not bind ADPr - trimer under rigor conditions Since myosin binds to two adjacent actin subunits present in one strand of F - actin and ADPr - trimer presents one such site , I investigated the binding of myosin S1 to ADPr - trimer under rigor conditions . 7 , 127 Unfortunately , no evidence of interaction was found . The binding of myosin S1 to ADPr - trimer was investigated using physical assays which included dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) , native - PAGE and analytical size - exclusion chromatography , and the biochemical myosin 73 ATPase assay . DLS measurements indicated no significant increase in the hydrodynamic radius of the mixture of ADPr - trimer and myosin S1 compared to controls , ADPr - trimer or myosin S1 alone . The hydrodynamic radii were 4 . 33 Â± 0 . 19 nm for ADPr - trimer alone ; 4 . 34 Â± 0 . 28 nm for myosin S1 alone ; and 4 . 62 nm Â± 0 . 06 for the ADPr - trimer and myosin S1 reaction ( Figure 2 . 7 ) . With native - PAGE , no shift was observed in the band for the reaction mixture containing ADPr - trimer and myosin S1 . ADPr - monomer and ADPr - dimer have no putative myosin binding sites and were therefore run as negative controls ( Figure 2 . 8A ) . Since myosin S1 alone was not observed on the native gels , myosin S1 might be found in the ADPr - trimer band present on the gel . Mass spectrometric analysis on the ADPr - trimer - containing bands from the native - PAGE revealed the presence of only actin peptides , but no myosin peptides . Myosin S1 bands tend to run as a smear on the native gel making it difficult to visualize diffuse signals with 0 . 95 Î¼g of myosin S1 present in the reactions using Coomassie stain . Therefore , 6 . 1 Î¼g of myosin S1 was loaded as a standard on the gel . In addition , all the samples were run on SDS - PAGE to confirm the presence of myosin S1 in all the reactions ( Figure 2 . 8B ) . Analytical gel filtration chromatography was performed with a mixture of ADPr - trimer and S1 , and ADPr - trimer alone . The reaction mix containing ADPr - trimer and myosin S1 eluted at a volume similar to the elution volume for ADPr - trimer alone ( Figure 2 . 9A ) . The elution fractions from the chromatographic column run on SDS - PAGE indicted that the peaks of myosin S1 and ADPr - trimer appear in different fractions suggesting no binding ( Figure 2 . 9B ) . To further confirm that myosin S1 does not bind ADPr - trimer , I performed biochemical myosin ATPase assays with F - actin as substrate as a positive control , and ADPr - monomer and dimer as negative controls . Myosin ATPase activity in the presence of ADPr - trimer was significantly lower than that in the presence of F - actin and comparable to the negative controls ( Figure 2 . 8C ) . 74 Figure 2 . 7 Dynamic Light Scattering measurement of ADPr - trimer and myosin S1 . The hydrodynamic radii of various reactions containing ADPr - trimer ( 4 Î¼M trimer = side binding sites ) and myosin S1 ( 1 . 5 Î¼M ) were measured using a Nano S Zetasizer . The value of radii measured for various reactions were : ( A ) ADPr - trimer alone , 4 . 33 nm Â± 0 . 19 ; ( B ) S1 alone , 4 . 34 nm Â± 0 . 28 ; and ( C ) ADPr - trimer and S1 , 4 . 62 nm Â± 0 . 06 . Compared to ADPr - trimer alone , no significant increase in the radii seen in the reaction with ADPr - trimer and S1 .

The ADPr - actin - containing complex activities were significantly different from that in the presence of F - actin ( p values : ADPr - monomer , 0 . 003 ; ADPr - dimer , 0 . 005 ; ADPr - trimer , 0 . 001 ) . ADPr - trimer did not activate myosin ATPase activity beyond that of ADPr - monomer ( p = 0 . 679 ) .

A ) Reaction mixtures containing 2 Î¼M ADPr - trimer and 0 . 87 Î¼M myosin S1 or 2 Î¼M ADPr - trimer alone in Super G - buffer were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature . The resulting mixture was then applied on a Superdex 200 ( 10 / 300 ) analytical gel filtration column equilibrated with Super G - buffer containing protease inhibitors . The bar above the absorbance profile indicates the fractions analyzed in panel ( B ) . B ) Silver - stained SDS - PAGE of the elution fractions of the reaction with ADPr - trimer and myosin S1 in ( A ) from analytical size - exclusion chromatographic column . ADPr - trimer peak appears at around fraction C2 ( 12 . 5 ml ) , while S1 peaks in fraction C5 ( 14 . 0 ml ) . Hence , S1 and ADPr - trimer elution peaks do not appear in the same fractions , indicating no binding . Chromatographic volume 12 ml to 18 ml in ( A ) corresponds to elution fractions ranging from C1 to C12 shown in ( B ) . A B 77 2 . 2 . 3b Remodeling by gelsolin does not rescue myosin binding 2 . 2 . 3b ( i ) Background The stoichiometry of gelsolin to ADPr - trimer is 1 : 1 in the GSFL : 3mr heterocomplex . While ADPr - trimer alone does not nucleate actin polymerization , GSFL : 3mr acts as a filament nucleator . Given this enabling of nucleating abilities of ADPr - trimer , I tested the hypothesis that gelsolin remodels ADPr - trimer to an F - actin - like structure that permits S1 binding . 2 . 2 . 3b ( ii ) Myosin does not bind Gelsolin bound ADPr - trimer under rigor conditions My results suggest no significant interactions between GSFL : 3mr and myosin S1 . For native gel reactions , no significant shift was observed in the band mobility of reactions with GSFL : 3mr and myosin S1 . Myosin S1 alone , ADPr - monomer alone and ADPr - trimer alone were run as controls on the native gel ( Figure 2 . 10A ) . Since GSFL : 3mr has Rf ( retention factor ) value similar to myosin S1 on a native gel , the reactions were run on SDS - PAGE to confirm the presence of all the reaction components . Some contaminating FL myosin is present in the S1 preparation ( Figure 2 . 10B ) . Chromatograms of a binding reaction containing GSFL : 3mr and myosin S1 indicated no shift in the elution peak compared to the elution peak of GSFL : 3mr alone . A major peak was observed at an elution volume of about 11 . 8 mL on the Superdex 200 10 / 300 column , along with a minor peak eluting at a volume of 15 mL . SDS - PAGE of fractions from the major peak showed the presence of GSFL and ADPr - trimer but no myosin S1 in these fractions . The myosin S1 band was seen in the loaded sample . Similarly , for the silver stained native gel , myosin S1 was present in the loaded sample but not in fractions from the major peak ( Figure 2 . 11 ) . The myosin ATPase activity measured in the presence of GSFL : 3mr was not significantly different than the activity 78 Figure 2 . 10 Binding and ATPase assays of myosin S1 with purified Gelsolin bound ADPr - trimer ( GSFL : 3mr ) .

The average activity for triplicate measurements is plotted Â±SE . GSFL : 3mr did not activate myosin ATPase activity beyond that seen with ADPr - monomer ( p = 0 . 18 ) , negative control , suggesting no interaction .

B ) SDS - PAGE of chromatographic analysis of elution fractions from the GSFL : 3mr - S1 reaction in ( A ) . Fractions B4 ( eluted at 10 . 26 ml ) to C2 ( eluted at 12 . 76 ml ) are across the major peak . While myosin S1 is present in the loaded sample ( Load ) , S1 is not present as a major band in the peak fractions of the elution profile . C ) Silver stained gel of major peak fractions identified in ( B ) . Note that S1 is not a major band in the peak fractions . A B C 80 seen in the negative control with ADPr - monomer as substrate ( p = 0 . 18 ) . The positive control , F - actin , activated myosin ATPase activity as expected ( Figure 2 . 10C ) . Therefore , I conclude that remodeling of ADPr - trimer by GSFL does not restore myosin binding . 2 . 2 . 3c Alternative polymerization inhibition â D : trimer does not bind myosin 2 . 2 . 3c ( i ) Background Since ADPr - trimer did not bind myosin under rigor conditions , nor with remodeling by gelsolin , it is possible that ribosylation interferes with myosin binding . Therefore , an alternative method of inhibiting polymerization of crosslinked trimer was applied . DNase I is an actin monomer binding protein that forms a binary complex with monomeric actin and prevents formation of filaments . 271 Blanchoin et al . ( 1995 ) reported that DNase I does not block myosin S1 binding to actin , forming a ternary complex of DNase I - actin - myosin S1 . 272 Therefore , I generated a DNase I - capped pPBM - crosslinked actin trimer ( D : trimer ) and tested its binding to myosin S1 . 2 . 2 . 3c ( ii ) Myosin does not bind DNase I bound ADPr - trimer under rigor conditions No interaction between D : trimer and myosin S1 was observed on using native gel analysis or myosin ATPase assays . No new band appeared on native gels for the reactions with D : trimer and myosin S1 . D : trimer did not activate myosin ATPase activity beyond the negative control , D : dimer , and the ATPase activity was significantly lower than F - actin ( Figure 2 . 12 ) . 2 . 2 . 4 Discussion and Conclusion Previous biochemical and physical investigations indicated that ADPr - trimer mimics F - actin . It bound to ABPs such as DNase I at the pointed end and gelsolin at the barbed end . Here I extended this research by exploring whether ADPr - timer has an interface to bind the side - binding F - ABP myosin . My results suggest myosin did not bind ADPr - trimer , nor did it activate actin - 81 Figure 2 . 12 DNase I bound crosslinked actin trimer ( D : trimer ) interactions with myosin S1 . A ) Silver stained SDS - PAGE of binding reactions including 0 . 42 Î¼M DNase I capped actin oligomers in the presence or absence of 0 . 37 Î¼M myosin S1 . DNase I was also run alone to identify that band . No new bands were seen suggesting myosin S1 bound to the DNase I bound actin oligomers . B ) Myosin ATPase activity assays including 0 . 125 mg / mL myosin in the presence of 1 . 5 Î¼M F - actin or DNase I bound crosslinked actin oligomers . No significant activity was observed for DNase I bound actin trimers . A B 82 activated myosin ATPase activity . Moreover , capping cross - linked actin trimer with DNase I to inhibit polymerization or remodeling of ADPr - trimer by gelsolin did not restore myosin binding . As indicated previously , pPBM crosslinking inhibits force generation but not myosin binding or myosin ATPase activity . 71 Therefore , crosslinking in the ADPr - trimer should not interfere with the binding of myosin . Likewise , in another study involving actin crosslinked with glutaraldehyde , which inserts inter - and intramolecular crosslinks through amino acids , myosin bound to crosslinked actin but interfered with the sliding movement . 273 Later in 2007 , Kozaku et al . indicated that the actin filament can exist in different conformational states , described as low and high - FRET conformations . F - actin can transition between these states either spontaneously or upon binding of ABPs . They suggested that crosslinking shifts actin to a lower a conformational state that allows myosin binding , but inhibits the myosin induced motility . 274 Given these points from the previous studies , crosslinks can be inserted into F - actin without interfering with its ability to bind myosin . Another modification that was introduced was ADP - ribosylation of each actin subunit in the ADPr - trimer . The ADP - ribosyl group is located at the intersubunit interaction site in F - actin ; consequently , the bulky group at the site likely interferes with the formation of the correct interface at the contact site involving three actin subunits . The ADP - ribosylated actin monomers can copolymerize with native actin and interact with ABPs including myosin . Therefore , the ADP - ribosyl group does not interfere with binding of myosin on monomeric actin . 275 Since gelsolin can remodel ADPr - trimer into a nucleating - competent structure , binding of GSFL : 3mr with myosin S1 was tested , but the gelsolin - bound ADPr - trimer did not bind myosin . Next , to rule out the possibility that the ADP - ribosyl group on each subunit of ADPr - trimer interferes with myosin binding , DNase I was used to inhibit polymerization of cross - linked F - actin derived trimer 83 ( D : trimer ) . D : trimer did not show any signs of binding to myosin . Why then does the ADPr - trimer not bind myosin ? An answer comes from a parallel research performed by another group in Germany . Qu et al . ( 2018 ) produced a pPBM - crosslinked oligomer similar to my ADPr - trimer . They produced heterologously inhibited pPBM - trimer ( hetADPr - trimer ) by purification of the pPBM - crosslinked trimer on a size - exclusion column followed by polymerization inhibition by substoichiometric ADP - ribosylation on Arg - 177 by iota toxin . Since the ADP - ribosylated crosslinked trimer could polymerize to some extent , complete inhibition of polymerization was achieved by incubating the ribosylated trimer with gelsolin segment - 1 ( G1 ) at an equimolar ratio to trimer . The resulting hetADPr - trimer bound skeletal myosin and activated myosin ATPase . The preliminary negative - stained EM model of hetADPr - trimer suggests myosin bound to the sides of the trimer along the two long pitch actin subunits . 104 The key difference between my ADPr - trimer and the hetADPr - trimer is the use of stoichiometric and substoichiometric strategies for polymerization inhibition . Previously generated G1 - bound pPBM trimer had distorted symmetry due to intercalation of G1 between the subunits . 72 Similarly , stochiometric ribosylation of ADPr - trimer subunits seems to distort the myosin binding interface . 11 , 72 However , use of a substoichiometric combination of ADP - ribosylation and G1 for polymerization inhibition resulted in heterogeneous trimer that not only binds to myosin , but also activates myosin ATPase activity . In conclusion , I believe my stringent polymerization inhibition strategy to obtain a homogenous short F - actin oligomer for crystal studies introduced distortions at the myosin binding surface . In contrast , the combination of two polymerization inhibition strategies generated a heterogenous trimer which bound myosin . 84 Collective data from the ADPr - trimer and hetADPr - trimer binding studies suggest that the presence of an ADP - ribosyl group at the inter subunit interaction site of the three subunits distorts the myosin binding site . Although myosin forms a ternary complex with the DNase I - bound actin monomer , binding of DNase I to the pointed end subunits of the crosslinked trimer may also cause conformational changes remodeling the myosin binding site . Conformational flexibility of actin is required for actin to function . 4 This flexible nature allows F - actin to act as molecular springs for force generation in conjunction with myosin . 6 Studies show that crosslinked actin filaments bind to myosin and activate ATPase activity , but their mobility is reduced . 71 , 276 F - actin exists in multiple structural states that may account for the selective binding of F - ABPs . 55 Alternatively , the binding of F - ABPs induce changes in the twist of the filament . Structural changes in F - actin upon myosin binding are proposed to play a role in actomyosin interactions . These conformational changes are not limited to the ABP binding site but are allosterically propagated to distant sites . 277 Cryo - EM studies of myosin bound to actin filaments during the rigor state have provided some insights into the binding surface . However , what remains unresolved is how the lever arm movement of myosin is coupled to the closure of the actin binding cleft and Pi release . This movement is central to chemo - mechanical force generation by actomyosin . 42 Additionally , the mechanism of the ADP - to - rigor state transition is not known . Cryo - EM reconstructions by Gurel et al . ( 2017 ) of the ADP - bound and rigor states give some idea of sequence of events from ATP binding and hydrolysis steps to force generation . 6 Structural changes at the myosin binding interface propagated across the lateral interface between subunits suggest cooperative myosin binding to F - actin . 128 Allosteric regulation of actin filaments by cooperative conformational changes upon binding of ABPs regulate binding in a 85 mutually exclusive manner . 278 , 279 Despite the bulk of research supporting cooperativity , Qu et al . ( 2018 ) showed that an actin trimer with one myosin binding site is the smallest F - actin scaffold required to bind myosin and activate myosin ATPase activity . Self - assembly of actin into filaments and the interactions between subunits is biologically important for actin to accomplish its physiological role ; thus , creating a short F - actin oligomer to study actin structure and dynamic interactions within and with ABPs is an attractive but challenging research area . Any approaches applied to modify actin should be strategically balanced to maintain physiological interactions that are integral to F - actin structure and function . Considering the work of Qu et al . ( 2018 ) , stoichiometric ribosylation of pPBM crosslinked actin and capping with DNase I at the pointed end of the trimer resulted in disruption of myosin binding interface resulting in no interaction with myosin . However , other ABPs such as gelsolin and cofilin bound to the ADPr - trimer support the view that various ABPs can bind in a mutually exclusive manner . This mechanism has been thought of as a mode of regulating actin function and localization of actin in various regions of the cells . Future study will involve exploring other ABPs that can bind to ADPr - trimer and study actin interfaces that support different modes of binding . 2 . 2 . 5 Future Directions The hetADPr - trimer made by Qu et al . ( 2018 ) is the smallest known short F - actin oligomer that binds myosin S1 and activates ATPase . However , it remains to be established if hetADPr - trimer supports lever arm movement required for force generation . Future work therefore entails purifying hetADPr - trimer and monitoring motility of fluorescently labelled myosin over actin coated surface in an in vitro motility assay using fluorescence microscopy . 280 â 282 Although myosin ATPase activity of pPBM crosslinked filaments remains unaffected , they have reduced velocity in vitro motility assays . 71 Conformational changes in the N - and C - termini 86 of F - actin upon myosin binding have been reported ; however , the exact role of the C - termini remains unclear . 267 Myosin induced conformational changes in the C - terminus of actin have been observed using pyrene labelled actin Cys - 373 ( Cys - 374 in Î± - actin ) . 283 Pyrene fluorescence results are supported by a stabilized C - terminus observed in the actomyosin structure which is not observed in the F - actin - tropomyosin structure . 4 , 267 The C - terminus in pPBM crosslinked actin is restricted due to the involvement of Cys - 374 ( the second last amino acid ) in crosslinking ; therefore pPBM crosslinked actin can be used to study how restricting the C - terminus affects lever arm movement and force generation . This work will require production of filaments made from purified crosslinked pPBM dimers and trimers , and measurement of their ATPase activity and motility over myosin . For F - dimer and F - trimer formed from pure dimer and trimer , respectively , the calculated gliding velocities would be 50 % and 33 % . These theoretical values are based on the percentage of crosslinked C - termini that would be present in pure F - dimer and F - trimer . In a preliminary experiment , I generated F - dimer and F - trimer from purified crosslinked dimers and trimers , noting some contamination of monomer in the dimer preparation . F - dimer and F - trimer were observed to glide at 70 % and 31 % of the velocity of uncrosslinked F - actin , respectively . Considering that contaminating monomer in the dimer preparation might account for the increased velocity of the F - dimer , these preliminary data support the idea that reduction in the motility of crosslinked filaments is the result of the percentage of subunits with the C - terminus restricted by crosslinking .

Protein was eluted with elution buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate dibasic , pH 7 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 100 mM imidazole ) . 10 % glycerol was added to the pooled fractions containing cofilin , flash frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at - 80â ( Figure 2 . 13 ) . 88 2 . 3 . 2b Physical and Biochemical Assays 2 . 3 . 2b ( i ) Co - sedimentation Assay Î± - skeletal actin ( 10 Î¼M ) was polymerized at pH 6 . 5 for 60 min at RT . The resulting F - actin was incubated on ice for 30 min with equimolar cofilin . Reactions were spun at 95 , 000 rpm ( 3 , 92 , 499 x g ) for 15 min ( Beckman TLA - 100 rotor ) . The resulting pellet and supernatant were run on SDS - PAGE . F - actin or cofilin alone were run as controls . 2 . 3 . 2b ( ii ) Pyrene Depolymerization Assay G - actin ( 2 Î¼M ) containing 15 % pyrene actin was polymerized by adding polymerization salts with a final concentration of 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 . 0 mM EGTA for 60 min at RT . Fluorescence intensity was monitored using a Cary Eclipse fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 347 and 406 nm , respectively . 10 Î¼M of cofilin or equivalent volume of cofilin buffer was added to the polymerized actin after obtaining a baseline and the fluorescence intensity measured over time . 2 . 3 . 2b ( iii ) Native - PAGE ADPr - trimer - cofilin binding reactions Reaction mixtures containing 2 . 38 Î¼M of ADPr - monomer or trimer and cofilin in an equimolar ratio and reactions with 2 and 3 molar excess of cofilin to ADPr - trimer were incubated on ice for 60 min . The resulting reactions were run on native - PAGE at 4â and 60 V . Cofilin or ADPr - monomer or ADPr - trimer alone were run as controls . Cofilin that has a pI of 8 . 1 - 8 . 2 did not run on the gel with stacking gel at pH 8 . 5 . Hence , no cofilin alone band was observed on the gel . 89 D : trimer - cofilin binding reactions Native gel analysis of the reactions was performed as described earlier . Binding reactions contained 1 . 7 Î¼M of DNase I - capped actin monomer ( D : monomer ) or trimer ( D : trimer ) in the presence or absence of 1 . 7 Î¼M cofilin incubated on ice for 60 min . Cofilin , D : monomer and D : trimer were run as controls on the gel . 2 . 3 . 2b ( iv ) EM Imaging Actin filament binding reactions Binding reactions containing 11 . 9 Î¼M of actin alone or 11 . 9 Î¼M actin and 35 . 7 Î¼M cofilin ( 1 : 3 molar ratio ) in 2 mM MOPS , pH 6 . 5 , 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 were incubated for 60 min at RT . All reaction components were filtered with a 0 . 22 micron Millipore filter . 10 Î¼L of each of the binding reactions was applied to plasma - treated carbon coated copper grids . The excess sample was blotted from the grid using filter paper after 30 s followed by incubation with 10 Î¼L of a 2 % uranyl acetate stain for 30 s . Excess stain was blotted off . The grids were imaged using FEI Tecnai G2 F20 ( FEI Company , Hillsboro ) aligned for parallel illumination and operated at 200 kV fitted with a bottom mount Gatan 4k CCD . The images were generated in collaboration with the Khursigara laboratory . The diameter of the filaments was measured using ImageJ . ADPr - trimer binding reactions ADPr - trimer and cofilin in 1 : 2 molar ratio ( 3 . 5 Î¼M ADPr - trimer : 7 Î¼M cofilin ) were incubated on ice for 60 min in Super G - buffer with 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 . All reaction components were filtered through 0 . 22 Î¼m Millipore filters . Negatively stained grids and imaging were performed as described above for actin filament binding reactions . 90 2 . 3 . 3 Results and Discussion Cofilin binds F - actin at a pH less than 7 . 3 without destabilizing it and promotes severing at higher pH values . 284 Cofilin decorated actin filaments for cryo - EM structural determination were obtained by binding cofilin to actin filaments at pH 6 . 5 . 153 , 285 Therefore , I confirmed the binding ability of recombinant cofilin to actin filaments at pH 6 . 5 through co - sedimentation assays and negatively stained cofilin decorated actin filaments . The presence of cofilin in the F - actin pellet of co - sedimentation assays confirmed binding of cofilin to F - actin ( Figure 2 . 14 ) . The negatively stained cofilin decorated actin filaments were approximately 20 % thicker than the undecorated filaments due to the mass of the bound cofilin ( Figure 2 . 15 ) . Actin filaments appeared thicker in negatively stained images in the presence of cofilin and this corresponded with an increase in light scattering intensity of F - actin and cofilin reaction mixtures noted by others . 286 Pyrene depolymerization assays demonstrated the binding and severing activity of cofilin . An initial drop in the intensity of pyrene fluorescence followed by a steady state of fluorescence intensity was observed upon addition of cofilin to F - actin ( Figure 2 . 16 ) . The initial decrease in fluorescence intensity could result either from quenching of pyrene fluorescence upon cofilin binding or fragmentation of filaments followed by slow depolymerization or stabilization of fragmented filaments by cofilin . Nishida et al . ( 1984 ) also observed that cofilin addition reduced the fluorescence intensity of F - actin to that of G - actin , suggesting cofilin transforms actin subunits within the filament to a conformation similar to G - actin . The actin observed a linear decrease in fluorescence intensity with increasing cofilin concentration with maximum quenching observed at an equimolar molar ratio . F - actin fragmentation upon the addition of sub - stoichiometric amounts of cofilin was also supported by a decrease in the viscosity of F - actin solutions , an effect similar 91 Figure 2 . 13 10 % SDS - PAGE gel of purification progress of cofilin . Shown from left to right : flow through ( FT ) from cobalt affinity column , cell pellet expressing cofilin , supernatant ( S / N ) loaded onto the column after lysis and spinning , wash I without imidazole , wash II with 2 mM imidazole , cofilin bound to the resin and elution fractions pooled based on the cofilin concentration ( pool 1 , 2 and 3 ) . Purified cofilin was stored with 10 % glycerol at - 80â . 92 Figure 2 . 14 10 % SDS - PAGE gel of co - sedimentation assay for cofilin . 10 Î¼M of F - actin was incubated with an equimolar amount of cofilin on ice for 1 hour . The reaction was spun at 392 , 499 x g for 15 min in TLA - 110 Beckman rotor . The resulting pellet ( P ) and supernatant ( S / N ) were run on SDS - PAGE . The presence of cofilin along with actin in the pellet fraction indicated binding . F - actin alone and cofilin alone were run as controls . 93 Figure 2 . 15 Negatively stained micrographs of F - actin in the absence and presence of cofilin . Samples containing F - actin alone ( A ) or F - actin with cofilin in 1 : 3 molar ratio ( B ) were incubated at RT for 60 min and mounted on grids and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . Actin filaments with cofilin bound appeared thicker and were in bundles . C and D are single filaments from A and B , respectively . Scale bar on C and D ( 0 . 027 Î¼m ) was added based on the calibration scale from A and B ( 0 . 1 Î¼m ) using ImageJ . B A C D 94 Figure 2 . 16 Effect of cofilin on actin depolymerization . Time course of depolymerization of 10 Î¼M 15 % pyrene F - actin in absence ( A ) and presence of cofilin ( B ) . 10 Î¼M of cofilin or cofilin buffer were added to the polymerized actin after obtaining a baseline for the fluorescence intensity . A rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed upon addition of cofilin followed by a steady phase ( B ) . A B Buffer added Cofilin added 95 to the severing protein gelsolin . Nishida et al . ( 1984 ) observed an increase in light scattering intensity ( LSI ) upon mixing cofilin to F - actin , attributed to the binding of cofilin along the entire length of actin filament . 286 Others have suggested that the initial rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity is due to fast cooperative binding followed by slower act of partial depolymerization and the drop in viscosity upon addition of cofilin could be due to change in flexibility or fragility of the cofilin bound actin filaments . 149 The saturation of actin filaments with cofilin changes the average helical twist of actin filaments by five degrees per subunit . 150 Severing of actin filaments into segments in the presence of cofilin has been confirmed using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF ) . 152 Thus , co - sedimentation assays , negatively stained EM micrographs and pyrene depolymerization assays all confirmed the ability of cofilin to bind F - actin . With my goal to obtain a heterocomplex , binding between ADPr - trimer or ADPr - monomer and cofilin was determined by native - PAGE . Appearance of a higher new band on the gel indicated binding . The binding of ADPr - monomer and cofilin was further confirmed by analytical gel - filtration chromatography where a right - shift in the elution peak was observed ( Supplemental figure 2A ) . Cofilin binds to monomeric actin and cofilin binding sites on G - actin have been identified with NMR and crosslinking studies . 287 , 288 Since the only known predicted structure of cofilin bound to monomeric actin was obtained by superimposing the crystal structure of yeast - cofilin - 1 onto the structure of Twf - C ( C - terminal cofilin like domain of mouse twinfilin ) bound to actin monomer ( PDB : 3DAW ) , Cof : 1mr ( cofilin bound ADPr - monomer ) was purified and crystal trials were set - up collaboration with the Kimber lab ( Supplemental figure 2B ) . 289 Unfortunately , the complex did not yield any crystals . 96 For native gel reactions including ADPr - trimer and cofilin , the intensity of the trimer band decreased with an increase in the molar concentration of cofilin in the mixture . In addition , protein aggregation was observed in the wells of the gel corresponding to the reaction mix containing ADPr - trimer and cofilin ( Figure 2 . 17A ) . These native gel reactions were mounted on a carbon coated copper grid and stained with uranyl acetate for EM imaging . Filament like structures were observed in the EM micrographs ( Figure 2 . 17B ) . Filament formation might have resulted from cofilin induced conformational changes in ADPr - trimer that overcame the impact of ribosylation - meditated polymerization inhibition . In fact , cofilin binding to actin filaments is known to induce significant conformational changes that are greater than the change from G - to F - actin transformation . 153 Moreover , ADPr - trimer exhibits F - actin like flexibility that allows gelsolin to transform ADP - trimer into a nucleation competent structure ; therefore , conformational changes in ADPr - trimer upon cofilin binding that allows polymerization are possible . 11 Alternatively , cofilin molecules might bridge contacts between subunits of two or more ADPr - trimers resulting in filamentous structures . Cofilin bridges actin - actin contacts in polymerization - deficient rhodamine labelled actin . 152 During severing , cofilin disrupts longitudinal contacts in F - actin but cofilin forms a crosslink that maintains contacts between actin subunits and severing occurs in the undecorated regions to which cofilin - induced changes are propagated . 153 Monomeric actin forms a ternary complex with DNase I and cofilin , suggesting the existence of two distinct binding regions for these molecules on actin , I tested the binding of D : trimer to cofilin on a native gel . 290 A new higher band was observed on the native gel for the reaction with D : monomer and cofilin , whereas no shift in the band was observed for the reaction mixture with D : trimer and cofilin . This indicates that the cofilin binding site is disrupted in the D : trimer ( Figure 2 . 18 ) . 97 Figure 2 . 17 10 % Native - PAGE and electron micrograph of binding assay of cofilin . A ) 10 % Native - PAGE of binding reactions including cofilin and ADPr - monomer in 1 : 1 ratio , and cofilin and ADPr - trimer in 1 : 1 , 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 molar ratios . Cofilin or ADPr - monomer or trimer alone were run as controls on the gel . A shift in the band for the reaction with ADPr - monomer and cofilin indicated binding . For reactions containing ADPr - trimer and cofilin , the intensity of the trimer band decreased with an increase in the molar ratio of cofilin accompanied with protein aggregation observed in the corresponding wells . Since cofilin has a pI of 8 . 1 - 8 . 2 , cofilin band did not run on the native - PAGE with stacking gel at pH 6 . 8 . B ) Negatively stained micrograph of binding reaction with ADPr - trimer and cofilin at 1 : 2 molar ratio . Filamentous structures were observed . These filaments likely resulted in protein aggregation seen in the wells of the native gel . ADPr - trimer , although non - polymerizable , assembled into filaments upon cofilin binding .

However , a new band appeared for the reaction including D : monomer and cofilin suggesting formation of a ternary D : monomer : cofilin complex . D : monomer D : trimer D : monomer : cofilin 99 The structural features of the cofilin : ADPr - trimer filaments and the precise mechanism of conformational changes in the ADPr - trimer induced upon cofilin binding could not be deduced from the available data and would require further investigation . Overall , cofilin bound to ADPr - trimer but did not yield a complex suitable for crystallization or single particle cryo - EM structure determination . 2 . 3 . 4 Conclusion Cofilin is a well - established regulator of actin dynamics in cells . The binding site of cofilin on F - actin lies on the two adjacent longitudinal subunits along the helix ; a similar interface for side - binding ABPs exists on ADPr - trimer . Hence , to generate a heterocomplex for structural determination , I investigated the binding of cofilin to ADPr - trimer . Recombinant cofilin bound to native F - actin and both ADPr - monomer and trimer . ADPr - monomer binding to cofilin binding was confirmed by a band shift on the native gel and shift in elution peak on analytical chromatograms . The cofilin : 1mr was purified but did not yield crystals . In contrast , cofilin binding to ADPr - trimer resulted in the formation of non - crystallizable filamentous structures . The assembly of ADPr - trimer into filaments upon cofilin binding might be attributed to either the large structural changes influenced by cofilin overcoming the impact of ribosylation or / and cofilin forming alternative contacts between actin subunits of several ADPr - trimers bridging them together . It has not been determined if the filamentous cofilin : ADPr - trimer has an F - actin like helical twist . Interestingly , both myosin and cofilin bind to F - actin cooperatively in clusters and compete for binding to F - actin ; however , unlike cofilin , myosin was unable to bind or induce any conformational changes in ADPr - trimer to facilitate its binding . 278 Understanding the nature of cofilin - induced conformational changes in ADPr - trimer and its physiological significance requires further investigation , and is beyond the scope of this research . 100 2 . 3 . 5 Future Directions Cofilin bound ADPr - timer produced a complex unsuitable for crystallization and single particle analysis , therefore the complex obtained did not have any potential for generating structural information . However , investigating the ADPr - trimer : cofilin with cryo - EM using helical reconstruction and comparing it to the EM structures available might reveal a different mode of binding of cofilin to actin filaments . An alternative actin long - dimer ( LD ) consisting of two actin subunits from the same F - actin strand was prepared by copolymerizing Q41C / C374A human ACTC mutant actin with Î± - cardiac bovine actin following Morrisonâs protocol with slight modifications . 68 Preliminary results from native gel of the LD with cofilin produced a band shift suggesting an interaction . This interaction can be confirmed with other experimental techniques and the heterocomplex purified for future crystal trials or single particle cryo - EM ( Supplemental figure 3 ) . 2 . 4 Gelsolin is an ADPr - trimer binding actin binding protein 2 . 4 . 1 Background Gelsolin is an actin - severing protein . The mechanism of gelsolin binding and severing have been deduced from a combination of biochemical and structural investigations ; however , no high resolution structure of either full - length gelsolin bound to F - actin or gelsolin capped F - actin is available . 209 Here I aimed to generate the first near atomic resolution structure of the gelsolin capped ADPr - trimer . For details on gelsolin biology , severing mechanism and structural models refer to section 1 . 3 . 3 of Chapter 1 . Gelsolin binds to ADPr - trimer in an equimolar ratio to form a GSFL : 3mr complex with an estimated molecular weight of 212 kDa . The GSFL : 3mr complex did not crystallize ; therefore , 101 single particle cryo - EM reconstruction ( SPR ) was considered to resolve the structure of the complex . The suitability of the sample for SPR was determined by negative staining . The GSFL : 3mr negative staining EM work was an initiative aimed to create a workflow and platform for future cryo - EM structural determinations of non - crystallizable actin complexes . The negatively stained micrographs were acquired at the Molecular and Cellular Imaging Facility at Guelph and image analysis was established and performed in collaboration with the Khursigara lab . Potential collaborators beyond the Guelph campus for future cryo - EM imaging and data processing were also identified and established . 2 . 4 . 1a Negative Stain Single particle EM imaging of negatively stained and cryo preserved samples is becoming more common for the structural determination of biomolecules . Negative staining is used to assess the quality of the specimen and optimize conditions for cryo - EM . 291 Negative staining provides information on the compositional and conformational homogeneity of the protein complexes , size and shape of the oligomeric state , and the tendency of the sample to dissociate or aggregate . 260 Negative staining involves embedding the protein molecules absorbed onto a carbon film in a layer of heavy metal salt . Since the protein molecules adsorbed onto a carbon film are enveloped by an electron dense stain , high contrast is produced with particles appearing as light areas because of low electron density and low electron scattering power relative to the surrounding dense stain . Both high contrast and the tendency of proteins to absorb on the carbon film in one or a few preferred orientations allows assessment of the heterogeneity of the sample . 291 , 292 Some sub - structural features are revealed if the stain is able to penetrate into crevices on the protein producing irregular contrast . 292 , 293 However , negative staining can introduce some artifacts ; specifically , flattening of the molecule and air - drying during sample preparation can affect the structural 102 integrity of samples sensitive to dehydration . Since the limits of achievable resolution is ~ 20 Ã , reconstructed 3D models from negative stain imaging depict the overall shape of the sample and less information within the core . 292 , 294 2 . 4 . 2b Single Particle Reconstruction Single particle reconstruction ( SPR ) determines structure by averaging multiple views of several copies of the same molecule , so is sometimes referred to as single particle averaging . 251 Structural determination by SPR requires acquisition of a large number of images with high contrast and sufficient resolution to determine structural details . The acquisition and processing of such a large dataset is often time consuming . However , with recent computer advancements , images can be automatically collected and image processing software , such as EMAN2 , Relion , SPIDER , FREALIGN , and SPARX can reconstruct 3D models from 2D micrographs . 295 â 301 3D structural determination from 2D micrographs utilizes SPR algorithms and an advanced set of heuristics to select specific algorithms for each refinement task . 302 â 304 The process of image analysis begins by the labour - intensive process of picking and extracting single protein particles that are oriented and distributed randomly in the EM micrographs . A contrast transfer function ( CTF ) correction is applied to restore undistorted information that is buried in the noise . 305 Structure determination begins with 2D analysis of the extracted particles . The extracted particles are grouped into homogenous subsets based on their angular alignments . The subsets of particles in each homogenous group are aligned and averaged to create class - averages . 2D class averages are then used to estimate and iteratively reconstruct a 3D model ( Figure 2 . 19 ) . 303 I used EMAN2 for SPR because it is user friendly and does not require Nvidia GPU , so it could be installed on the computers available in the Khursiagara lab . 260 103 Figure 2 . 19 Flow chart of single particle reconstruction in EMAN 2 . 2 . Figure adapted from Zhou ( 2015 ) . 306 104 However , automated particle picking in EMAN2 can only be run only on Nvidia GPU ; therefore , I manually picked ~ 42 , 500 protein particles from the micrographs . 2 . 4 . 2 Experimental Procedures 2 . 4 . 2a Purification of Proteins Gelsolin , ADPr - trimer and gelsolin bound ADPr - trimer ( GSFL : 3mr ) were prepared as described previously in section 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 4 . 2b Determining Stability of the Complex Purified fractions containing GSFL : 3mr complex were divided into 100 Î¼L aliquots and stored at 4â and - 80â . Aliquots of fractions were run on native gels on day 1 , 3 and 5 post - purification to determine stability of the complex . 2 . 4 . 2c Negative Stained Grid Preparation 7 Î¼L of purified GSFL : 3mr complex at a concentration of 6 Î¼g / mL was applied onto glow discharged carbon coated copper grids to achieve good distribution of the particles on the grid . After 30 s of incubation of the sample on the grid , excess sample was blotted off from the grid using filter paper . The samples were stained with 7 Î¼L of 2 % uranyl acetate stain for 30 s . Excess stain was blotted off . Grids were stored at RT for imaging . 2 . 4 . 2d Imaging , Data Collection and Processing The negatively stained grids were imaged at the Molecular and Cellular Imaging Facility , University of Guelph using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 ( FEI Company , Hillsboro ) aligned for parallel illumination and operated at 200 kV fitted with a bottom mounted Gatan 4k CCD . Images were collected with a defocus range between 0 . 599 Î¼m and 3 . 9 Î¼m with a pixel size of 4 . 53 Ã / pixel . GSFL : 3mr complex particles were single - dispersed . 105 Particle Picking and Classification Single protein particles were selected manually using the EMAN2 interactive boxing function ( e2boxer ) . The average length of the particles was ~ 75 . 5 Ã ; thus , the box size was set to 117 . 9 Ã to accommodate particles in the box with enough background . In total , ~ 42 , 500 particles were extracted from the micrographs . A contrast transfer function ( CTF ) correction was applied to the micrographs as recommended in the EMAN2 protocol to improve the appearance of the model and reduce artifacts . Class averages were generated by reference - free classification ( 2Drefine function ) for the entire data set based on an automated iterative alignment approach . 297 In total , 31 class averages were generated . Each class average had a large number of particles with similar size , shape and orientation . As a result , the signal was intensified , and the shape of the complex became more prominent . The class averages presenting sharp and strong features with clearly delineated borders of the protein were used for analysis . Smeared or blurry class averages were removed from the set . Of the 42 , 500 particles picked , ~ 36 , 250 were included for generating the class averages . Any particles that were not centered in the particle selection box were excluded by the aligning function of the software . Class averages underwent 8 iterations ; all parameters for class average generation were selected as recommended by the developer . Building and Refining of the model Producing a 3D high resolution refined model is an iterative process that requires an initial 3D model . The approach for initial model generation is incorporated into the e2initial model function in EMAN2 which is based on a Monte - Carlo algorithm . An initial model is generated from user - identified class averages representing different views of the particle , not including 106 projections of different compositional or conformational states of the particle . The initial model can be iteratively refined with the entire data set of particles using the EMAN2 real space projection matching algorithm ( e2refine ) . 297 In the present work , the sample potentially exhibited heterogeneity and the features of heterogenous species were not identifiable in the class averages obtained , therefore 3D models representing the heterogenous species could not be generated based on the micrographs and available image processing . However , for training purpose and to demonstrate the workflow for EM model generation , an initial model was generated by selecting nine class averages that appeared similar in size and presented different views of the particle . The initial model was refined against the entire dataset . Eight initial models were generated after which the iteration that represented features of the class averages was refined against the entire dataset . Since the symmetry of the complex is not known , C1 symmetry was applied for model generation . Other parameters were selected as recommend by the developer . 2 . 4 . 3 Results and Discussion GSFL : 3mr complex purified on a gel filtration column appeared as a single band on the native gel ( Figure 2 . 20 ) . The complex was stable at 4â for up to 3 days , while at - 80â the complex formed aggregates present as additional bands on the native gel ( Figure 2 . 21 ) . Therefore , the purified complex was stored at 4â and used to prepare negatively stained grids on day 2 following purification . For each round of optimization of staining and imaging , a fresh batch of complex was prepared . Six batches of complex were purified with each complex preparation taking 16 - 18 days . Once the staining and imaging protocol was optimized , the grids with the negatively stained complex were stored at RT and imaged over a period of a few months at the Molecular and Cellular Imaging Facility , University of Guelph . 107 Figure 2 . 20 Purification of GSFL : 3mr complex . A ) 10 % native gel of GSFL : 3mr elution fractions from Superdex 200 ( 10 / 300 ) . B ) Chromatogram corresponding to the elution fractions shown in A . Elution fractions , D2 and D1 , were screened at various concentrations on negativley stained grids to rule out the presence of any aggregates and optimize protein concentration to obtain a uniform distribution of protein particles on grids for imaging . Elution fractions D5 to D1 were obtained in elution volume ranging from 11 . 2 ml to 12 . 2 ml . A B Volume ( ml ) 108 Figure 2 . 21 Stability of GSFL : 3mr complex determined on 10 % native gels . Aliquots of elution fractions , D4 and D3 , were stored at different temperatures and run on native gel on day 1 , 3 and 5 with day 1 being the day of purification . A ) Native gel of fractions , D4 and D3 , on day 1 . GSFL or ADPr - trimer ( 3mr ) alone were run as controls . B ) Elution fractions stored at 4â were run on the native gel on day 3 . A band representing GSFL : 3mr complex was visible for each of the fractions , D4 and D3 . C ) On day 5 , fractions stored at 4â and - 80â were run on gel . Complex in fraction D4 stored at 4â had completely degraded , while fraction D3 stored at - 80â showed protein aggregation which was seen as additional bands on the gel . Thus , for each round of sample screening for EM , freshly purifed complex was stored at 4â and applied to grids on day 2 . A C B 109 Figure 2 . 22 Negatively stained EM micrographs . Four representative micrographs of the total of 437 micrographs that were obtained from a single preparation of GSFL : 3mr complex . GSFL : 3mr complexes were randomly dispersed on carbon coated copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate . Scale bar represents 50 nm . 110 Figure 2 . 23 Selection of negatively stained GSFL : 3mr particles . Micrographs along with a stack of particles extracted from each of these micrographs ( A and B ) . Particles were picked manually form the micrographs using 117 . 9 Ã boxes . ~ 42 , 500 particles were manually selected from 437 micrographs . Overlapping particles were not selected . Scale bar 50 nm . A B 111 More than 600 micrographs were acquired over a period of four months . Overall , 437 micrographs presenting evenly distributed distinct protein particles were used for analysis by EMAN2 ( Figure 2 . 22 ) . In total , ~ 42 , 500 protein particles were selected manually from the micrographs using image processing software EMAN2 ( Figure 2 . 23 ) . The process of manually picking - particle took 7 full days . These particles were organized into 31 class averages which included ~ 36 , 000 particles . Any particles that were not centered in the selection box or did not align with any of the class averages were excluded by the averaging function of the software . The relatively small number of class averages generated from a large number of particles suggest that the GSFL : 3mr complex adsorbs onto the carbon grid in a few favoured orientations . Most of the class averages depicted a donut like shape . The three actin subunits of trimer were visible in some class averages as three dots . The empty space visible in the center of some class averages could be due to the presence of an ADP - ribosyl group at the intersubunit interaction site , conformational changes upon gelsolin binding , or deformation of the complex due to staining . Of the 31 class averages , 19 with sharp and strong features of the protein were chosen for further analysis ( Figure 2 . 24 ) . Those that were smeared and blurry were removed from the set . The class averages differed in their diameter . For example , class averages 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 appear smaller compared to 9 , 10 , 11 and 15 . Different sizes of class averages indicated the existence of either compositional or conformational heterogeneity in the specimen ( Figure 2 . 24 ) . Measurements of specific particles were made using âmeasureâ tool in ImageJ showing the diversity of particle dimensions within the sample ( Figure 2 . 25 ) . Multiples modes of complex formation or unstable complexes that dissociate during staining can lead to heterogeneity in the sample . Heterogeneity can also be introduced to some extent by the negative stain procedure due 112 Figure 2 . 24 Class averages representing features of the GSFL : 3mr sample . Class averages were obtained by e2Drefine function in EMAN2 which uses an iterative reference free method . The initial set of iteration produces a set of class averages based on rotational and translational invariants computed for each particle . This initial set of class averages provide alignment references to which all particle data set was compared and aligned for the next iteration . The aligned particles were averaged , and the least similar particles were excluded . The new class average acts as an alignment reference to the next iteration . Comparison of the class averages suggested presence of particles of different size in the sample . Class averages 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 appear smaller in size compared to 9 , 10 , 11 and 14 . 113 Figure 2 . 25 Enlarged view of a part of two different micrographs indicating negatively stained GSFL : 3mr complex particles . A and B indicate dimensions of 10 particles from micrographs C and D , respectively measured in ImageJ . Particles of different size in the sample suggests presence of heterogeneity in the sample .

A B C D 114 to distortions during absorption of the molecule on the grid or due to inconsistent embedding in the stain . 292 Since it is not possible to reliably sub - categorize the observed heterogenous class averages into groups representing different structural complexes , a reliable biologically relevant model could not be generated . However , to demonstrate the process of single particle model building , refinement and rigid body fitting using Chimera , 9 class averages that were approximately similar in length were used ( Figure 2 . 26A ) . These class averages included 8 , 282 particles with 1400 to 700 particles in each class . Different views of the initial model generated from selected class averages is shown in Figure 2 . 26B . Refinement of this initial model with the entire particle set generated a low - resolution heart shaped structure with no visible surface details ( Figure 2 . 26C ) . Both the initial model and refined model presented an empty space in the center , a characteristic also seen in the class averages . Since the refined model was a blob , the electron density map of the initial model was used for rigid body fitting . A simulated model of gelsolin bound actin - trimer was produced in PyMOL from the available crystal structures of gelsolin segments bound to actin monomers and a cryo - EM structure of F - actin . Since the structure of ADPr - trimer is not available , actin trimer was adapted from cryo - EM structures of F - actin resolved by Wakabayshi et al . ( 2010 ) . 307 Thus , the trimer model did not present any variations in the intersubunit interactions introduced by chemical modifications ( chemical crosslinking and ribosylation ) that would exist in the ADPr - trimer . The simulated model was generated using the âalignâ function of PyMOL to overlay the actin subunits from crystal structures of G1 / actin monomer ( 1EQY ) and G4 - 6 / actin monomer complex ( 1H1V ) onto the trimer subunits . Since , the overall shape of the theoretical model generated in PyMOL based on McGoughâs ( 2011 ) model ( see Figure 1 . 7 ) did not resemble the initial model , a simulated model representing a different mode of binding of gelsolin segments 115 Figure 2 . 26 Building model from negative stained data . A ) Nine class averages were used to generate an initial negative staining model shown in B . B ) Different views of the initial model . C ) Initial model in B was refined with the entire data set . The refined model presented no structural details and appeared featureless . A C B 116 Figure 2 . 27 Side view of negative stain ( NS ) map and GS : 3mr model showing G1 and G4 - 6 bound to trimer based on McGoughâs model . A ) A model of actin trimer bound to gelsolin segments was generated in PyMOL based on McGoughâs model shown in figure 1 . 7 . 186 The trimer comprises of two subunits from one strand of F - actin ( cyan ) and one subunit of the counterpart strand ( pink ) . G1 ( yellow ) binds to one actin subunit and G4 - 6 ( yellow orange ) binds at the barbed - end to another laterally associated actin subunit from the adjacent strand within the filament . The overall shape of the PyMOL generated model did not appear similar to the negative stain initial map . PDB : 3G37 ( F - actin ) ; 1EQY ( G1 / actin monomer ) ; 1H1V ( G4 - 6 / actin monomer ) . 117 Figure 2 . 28 Visual ( manual ) fitting of the atomic coordinates of actin trimer bound to G1 and G4 - 6 in negative stain map . A ) Simulated model of actin trimer bound to gelsolin segments was generated in PyMOL ( PDB : 3G37 ( F - actin ) ; 1EQY ( G1 / actin monomer ) ; 1H1V ( G4 - 6 / actin monomer ) . G1 and G4 - 6 are shown in yellow and yellow orange , respectively . The trimer consists of two subunits from one strand of F - actin ( cyan ) and one subunit of the counterpart strand ( pink ) . The trimer does not present any alteration in intersubunit interactions that could occur due to crosslinking or presence of ribosyl group on each subunit . B ) Fitting of the simulated model into a NS map was done manually using Chimera . The overall shape of the NS map resembled the simulated model of the complex ; however , some regions of the simulated model did not fit into the NS map Conformational changes introduced into the actin trimer either due to gelsolin binding or chemical modifications ( ribosylation and crosslinking ) or lack of complete structural detail from the small number of class averages used to generate structure could result in an incomplete fit . The NS map was scaled to the simulated model using the A / pixel value from EMAN2 . The model was generated to depict the EM workflow . 18 Ö¯ 0 A B B 118 was generated to depict the EM workflow ( Figure 2 . 27 ) . The overall shape of this simulated model was similar to the initial model . This proposed simulated model was manually fitted into the electron density map of the initial model using Chimera . However , all the regions of this model did not fit into the map . This could result from missing structural details due a small number of class averages used for initial model building or due to the simulated model lacking conformational changes that occur upon complex formation , segments of gelsolin ( G2 ) , or actin modifications ( crosslinking and ribosylation ) ( Figure 2 . 28 ) . Since class averages did not show finer details , the possibility of inclusion of conformationally different class averages could not be ignored . Since heterogenous sub - populations could not be sub - classified using the workflow described in this thesis , the biological relevance of the model presented is questionable . Based on class - averages obtained , it was not possible to distinguish between different orientations and various conformational states of the complex . In addition , the GSFL : 3mr complex particles seemed extremely small , therefore any finer differences in the class averages were not prominent . For image processing alignment software to identify finer differences in structural features of conformationally diverse species , the sample might need to be imaged at a higher magnification ( ~ 100 - 150K ) than used for micrographs obtained for this project at an actual magnification of 66 , 170 - times . Alternative staining techniques can also be used to make the differences between the diverse species clear and overcome any deformations caused due to staining technique . Since several thousand particles were classified into a relatively small number of class averages , it appears that the conventional uranyl acetate negative staining technique used in this work favored a few preferred orientations of the complex on the carbon support . In addition , heterogeneity in the sample could have been caused by deformations of the complex during staining or incomplete stain embedding . To overcome these issues , an alternative carbon sandwich 119 staining technique that prevents artifacts due to incomplete embedding of specimen in stain could be used . The addition of sugar or glycerol to the specimen in the carbon sandwich technique promotes absorption of protein particles on carbon film in random orientations . However , specimens with glucose and sugars added require imaging at liquid nitrogen temperatures due to the sensitivity of sugars to radiation damage . 305 Dehydration of the sample during negative staining can also cause deformations or cause the complex to dissociate and can be avoided with the carbon layer sandwich technique . 308 In short , alternative staining approaches can improve the quality of 3D structures obtained by negative staining by reducing deformation due to dehydration , adsorption and incomplete staining . Other stains such as ammonium molybdate , aurothioglucose and tungstate stains also are available . 309 These differ in properties and lead to different staining of the samples . Uranyl acetate generates the highest contrast , but requires acidic conditions to prevent precipitation and thus could lead to pH - dependent conformational changes in the samples . However , it has been shown that the stain fixes protein structure on the millisecond time scale , avoiding this issue . 310 Optimizing the staining technique and acquiring images at a higher magnification can reduce artifacts and enhance some finer structural differences in heterogenous species for the image processing software to pick and analyse . Further , various image classification tools can be applied to group heterogenous species into distinct classes averages with distinguishable features for 3D map building . The alignment and classification of particles depend on the software and classification algorithms used . Basically , the classification methods are based on comparing and aligning pixel intensities of the imaged particles . Multi - reference alignment ( MRA ) process of particle classification can identify heterogenous species in a specimen . In this method , unique class 120 averages are selected from the reference - free classification result and used as references for MRA . In MRA , all the particle datasets are cross - correlated with all the references and designated to the reference that gives the highest value of cross - correlation . All images designated to references are averaged . The process is repeated iteratively using averages from each cycle as a reference for the next cycle until further improvement is observed in the resolution of the class averages . 311 IMAGIC , SPIDER , and EMAN have modules to perform alignment , of which SPIDER allows various classification algorithms to process the data set . 299 , 312 , 313 Thus , with the combination of optimized staining approaches and image processing , a reliable 3D map can be obtained from negatively stained heterogenous samples . Due to presence of high signal to noise ratios , negative staining can reveal heterogenous populations which are challenging to distinguish with vitrified samples and would produce unreliable features in 3D reconstructions of cryo - EM samples . 314 , 315 2 . 4 . 4 Conclusions Since there is no known structure of gelsolin - capped actin filaments or any high resolution structure of gelsolin bound to F - actin , I produced and purified gelsolin - bound ADPr - trimer complex for structural determination . 209 The GSFL : 3mr complex did not yield any crystals ; therefore , a negative staining EM approach was used to determine the quality of the complex for vitrification and possible cryo - EM 3D structure determination . Although the complex purified as a single band on the native gel , analysis of the negatively stained complex suggested the presence of heterogeneous species of the complex in the sample . Heterogeneity in the GSFL : 3mr complex sample might explain the inability of the complex to crystallize . Heterogeneity in the GSFL : 3mr complex sample could result from multiple binding modes of gelsolin to actin subunits in the ADPr - trimer , instability of the complex resulting in dissociation during the staining procedure , or artifacts produced by the staining technique . Precise distinctions between the heterogenous states 121 that existed in the sample could not be established based on the class averages obtained from the data acquired and available image processing . Optimized staining techniques coupled with images acquired at a higher magnification could make the finer distinctions between heterogenous species more evident . Moreover , using tools such as multiple reference alignment for 2D particle alignment can lead to identification of heterogenous species and generation of low - resolution 3D map of these species . The goal of work described in this thesis was to utilize the resources currently available in the department to determine feasibility and demonstrate the workflow for future EM structural work . Multiple modes of binding of gelsolin to ADPr - trimer or the complex adopting various conformations is yet it be established with further EM investigations . 2 . 4 . 5 Future Directions Future works entails exploring image classification tools such as multiple reference alignment for generating class averages of heterogenous population and installing automated particle picking software to avoid any errors introduced due to manual particle picking . Additionally , optimizing negative staining and increasing the electron microscopy imaging magnification depending on the protein sample under investigation should also be considered . The combination of these approaches has a potential to establish the suitability of the sample for vitrification and 3D map generation by cryo - EM . An updated computer system installed with GPU required for data processing , training on the image processing software and establishing collaborations with labs that routinely perform protein EM structural work would help streamline the process . Some potential future collaborators include Dr . John Rubinstein , University of Toronto and / or Dr . Joaquin Ortega , McGill University . The Rubinstein lab uses cryoSPARC and the Ortega lab uses EMAN2 for their EM structural data 122 processing . While EMAN2 and Relion are the most commonly used image processing platforms , other software that can be used alone or in combination could be explored . Some of the known software include â cryoSPARC , Eos , IMAGIC , IPLT , MDPP , MRC , Simple , Sparx , Spider , Suprim , SPHI , RE , Xmipp , Bsoft and Cyclops . Low - resolution negatively stained preliminary models of protein complexes can be produced from the images acquired on campus , with updated computing and image processing software . However , the generation of high resolution cryo - EM structures would require submitting proposals to facilities equipped with Krios G3 , a 300 kV Cryo Transmission Electron Microscope , for imaging . The two closet facilities to which cryopreserved samples can be shipped are the High - Throughput cryo - EM Facility , Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute , University of Toronto and the Facility for Electron Microscopy Research , McGill University . Cryo - EM structural work would require preparation of cryo - preserved sample grids and shipping these grids to the imaging facilities . Consistent preparation of protein sample cryo - grids with uniform ice thickness is crucial for obtaining micrographs for structural data . Therefore , I explored the feasibility of generating cryo - preserved samples for GSFL : 3mr complex in collaboration with the Khursigara lab using resources available in the MCI facility , University of Guelph ( Supplementary figure 6 ) . In addition to optimizing the protocol for the preparation of vitrified samples , a protocol for grid storage and shipment needs to be established . Along with establishing a pipeline for the future EM studies in the lab , I expanded my search for F - ABPs that bind ADPr - trimer using advances in proteomics . Since the candidate approach described in this chapter was limited to recombinantly - purified ABPs available to me , I applied an unbiased approach to identify potential ADPr - trimer interacting proteins from zebrafish 123 cell lysates using mass spectrometry . Details of my unbiased approach are described in the next chapter . 124 3 IDENTIFICATION OF ADPR - TIMER BINDING PARTNERS WITH ADPR - TRIMER PULL 1 DOWNS AND MASS SECTROMETRY 3 . 1 Overview In addition to the candidate - based approach described in chapter 2 , an unbiased approach was used to identify ADPr - trimer binding partners from cell lysates . Since we had access to the zebrafish facility in the Hagen Aqualab at the University of Guelph , we used 5 dpf ( days post fertilization ) zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos for generating cell lysates . Additionally , the zebrafish genome has been completely sequenced and at least one zebrafish homolog exists for 70 % of all human protein - coding genes . 316 Actin binding proteins from zebrafish cell lysates were retained on affinity resins obtained by coupling G - actin or ADPr - trimer ( 3mr ) to affigel - 10 , called G - affigel and 3mr - affigel , respectively . A control experiment showed that the actin binding segments 4 - 6 of gelsolin ( G4 - 6 ) bound to and could be eluted from G - affigel . 317 Actin monomer binding proteins were removed from the clarified zebrafish embryo lysate by incubating with G - affigel and the resulting flow through was incubated with 3mr - affigel . Any non - specifically binding proteins were removed with a 50 mM KCl wash . Proteins bound to the resulting resins were identified by mass spectrometry . The initial list of F - ABPs bound to ADPr - trimer was generated in consultation with Dr . Jennifer Geddes - McAlister , University of Guelph . The proteins that bound to G - affigel were eliminated and proteins detected with 3mr - affigel only with more than one detected peptide were examined . This presence / absence approach eliminated any further investigation of non - specific or background interactors . The identified hits were ranked based on their Q - value . The actin - associated functional role of identified hits was researched and myosin light chain 6B ( MLC6B ) was selected for further biochemical validation . Recombinant MLC6B was purified from a bacterial expression system with a removable affinity His 6 - tag . Our 125 results from pull - down assays indicate that apo - MLC6B and MLC6B associated with myosin binds to ADPr - trimer , supporting the MS results . Interestingly , apo - MLC6B does not bind uncrosslinked F - actin , suggesting that ADPr - trimer represents a conformation of F - actin that is favoured for MLC6B binding , with implications on the in vivo function of MLC6B . 3 . 2 Introduction 3 . 2 . 1 Mass Spectrometry Mass - spectrometry - based proteomics play a key role in protein identification and quantification in the study of protein - protein interactions , protein function , modification and localization . 318 The identification and characterization of proteins by MS involves two approaches : top - down and bottom - up . In the top - down approach , the intact proteins are used directly for analysis . 319 In the bottom up approach , proteins are enzymatically digested , and the resulting peptides are analysed for identification and characterization . The bottom - up approach , also referred to as the shotgun approach , uses labelled and label - free techniques for protein quantification . 320 The labelled technique requires incorporation of isotopic labels into samples being probed . 321 Labels can be introduced either in vivo by supplementing cell culture media with stable isotope - containing amino acids or in vitro by chemical or enzymatic means . 322 â 324 Labels allow identification of identical peptides from different samples , allowing several samples to be run on MS simultaneously , thereby removing variability between MS runs . 325 The main advantage of the labelled technique is that the molecular composition of the labelled sample and control are similar , thus identical peptides generated can be compared directly . 326 However , the labelled technique requires a culturable sample which involves a complex experimental protocol that uses expensive reagents , with the possibility of incomplete labelling and incomplete understanding the nature of different labels and the way they are introduced , or their efficiency . 327 Consequently , 126 label - free quantification techniques ( LFQ ) have gained in popularity . In contrast to the labelled technique , LFQ does not require peptides to be labelled and the peptides are compared directly across different samples from independent MS runs . Technical advances in high performance liquid chromatography systems ( HPLC ) , high resolution and scanning rates of mass spectrometers have made this possible . A detailed description of these technical advances is beyond the scope of this thesis . 327 Label - free quantification technique requires no extra labelling experimental steps and many samples can be compared simultaneously . The peptide mixture resulting from protein digestion of the samples is analysed by tandem MS ( MS / MS ) and identified by a database search . A major drawback with the label - free technique is that MS run conditions ( e . g . temperature , experimenter , column condition ) may differ between samples . Therefore , errors resulting from measurement conditions are more likely to occur in the label - free than labelled technique . However , including a well - chosen standard in label - free experiments ( e . g . a labelled control sample mixed to each sample ) prior to the MS run may reduce this problem . 326 Since the zebrafish embryos used in this project are not culturable and chemical labeling would involve a high cost , the LFQ technique was used for identification of F - ABPs retained on affinity resins in pull - down assays . The LFQ method broadly includes four fundamental steps : preparation of the sample , separation of peptides , analysis of the sample by MS / MS and data analysis ( identification , quantification and statistical analysis ) ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . 127 Figure 3 . 1 A typical workflow for a standard bottom - up proteomic analysis . Figure adapted from Mikalsen et al . ( 2008 ) . 325 128 3 . 2 . 1a Sample Preparation and Detection by MS / MS Preparation of the protein samples includes reduction of proteins by DTT or triethylphosphine followed by alkylation and digestion of the protein mixture with a protease , with trypsin being the most commonly used . The resulting peptide mixture is separated by high performance liquid chromatography and the effluent containing peptides is electro - sprayed into a mass spectrometer . The mass spectrometer collects MS / MS spectra for the peptides of the protein sample . The relative abundance of the protein in the original sample is deduced by comparing the number of MS / MS spectra among a set of experiments . Extensive MS / MS data detection across the chromatographic elution profile leads to protein identification and quantification . 327 , 328 3 . 2 . 1b MS Data Analysis Several software packages , such as MaxQuant , Scaffold and Proteome Discoverer are available for quantification of data obtained from label - free mass spectrometry techniques . These software packages provide an interface for a wide range of proteomics workflows , including protein peptide identification and quantification , and post translational modifications . Protein peptide identification of the MS / MS data involves database search engines , such as MASCOT , SEQUEST and X ! Tandem . These search engines compare observed spectra to the theoretical spectra of the reference proteome obtained in silico by virtual cleavage of peptides in the proteome sequence or spectral libraries of annotated observed spectra . 329 These search engines use different scoring and matching algorithms to assign scores to the peptides , providing the best matches . The match between spectrum and best scoring peptides is called Peptide - spectrum match ( PSM ) . With an increased number of unique peptides identified , the confidence in the identification of the proteins is increased . 330 However , there could be false identifications which are validated by applying a filter called the false discovery rate ( FDR ) , the expected percent of 129 false predictions in a set of predictions . The strict and relaxed FDR for PSM is usually set at 1 % and 5 % , respectively . A FDR value of 1 % indicates that only one in one hundred filtered matches are expected to be false positives . The confidence of specific identification is given by the Q - value ; the minimum false discovery rate required to accept the identification . 331 For example in Table 1 , a Q - value of 0 . 009 for Tyrosine 3 - monooxygenase activation protein and RAB2A means 0 . 9 % of all the proteins with a Q - value less than this are expected to be false positives i . e . , out of 378 of total identified proteins with a Q - value of less than 0 . 009 , only 3 . 4 of them are likely to be false positives . In case of MLC6B , a Q - value of zero indicates that the likelihood of having that as a false positive is extremely rare . Protein quantification or relative abundance is determined either by spectral counting or chromatographic peptide peak intensity measurements . Spectral counting estimates protein abundance by correlating the number of MS / MS spectra matched to a peptide from a protein to the amount of protein in the sample . 332 , 333 Studies indicate that the peptide spectral counts across different control runs are comparable and reproducible . 334 , 335 Peptide intensity measurements are obtained by integrating the area under the curve for a given peptide ion intensity over its chromatographic elution volume . 336 Studies indicate that both spectral and peptide intensity measurement correlate with protein abundances and inclusion of statistical analysis facilitates detection of small , but biologically significant differences in complex biological samples . 336 â 338 3 . 2 . 2 Light Chains of Myosin The lowest Q - score hit from my ADPr - trimer MS data analysis was MLC6B , a non - muscle essential light chain ( ELC ) that was identified as a potential binding partner of ADPr - trimer . MLC6B binds to both non - muscle myosin - IIA and - IIB . 339 A multiple sequence alignment shows 130 Figure 3 . 2 Multiple Sequence Alignment ( MSA ) of ELC isoforms . MSA of sequences of skeletal ELC isoforms found in human , rabbit and chicken with MLC6B . The major structural elements identified for ELC skeletal muscle are indicated as : A - actin binding region ; M - myosin SH3 binding region , I - IV - EF hand motifs . 340 Ala - Pro - Lys - Lys residues at the N - terminus interact directly with actin . 341 Removal of the first 11 amino acids of recombinant ELC A1 ( an ELC found in skeletal muscle ) bound to S1 abolishes crosslinking of ELC A1 with actin . 342 MSA was performed using CLUSTALW and the figure was generated in ESPript 3 . 0 . 131 Figure 3 . 3 Structural overview of myosin light chains . A ) Myosin light chains associated with the heavy chain . Myosin heavy chain , ELC and RLC are shown in gray , cyan and magenta , respectively . ELC and RLC bind to the IQ motif in the neck domain distal from the globular head domain ( PDB : 1S5G ) . B ) Overlay of theoretical model of MLC6B ( cyan ) with CaM ( tv green ) in cartoon representation . Since the structure of MLC6B is unknown , a theoretical model was generated using the Swiss - Model server with myosin light chain from PDB : 1W7I as template . The generated theoretical model of MLC6B was aligned with the structure of CaM ( PDB : 2IX7 ) . Like CaM , MLC6B possesses N - and C - terminal lobes consisting of two EF hand motifs . A B 132 a significant sequence identity between zebrafish MLC6B and human , chicken and rabbit skeletal muscle ELCs ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . Thus , it is important to review the structure and function of myosin light chains to set the context for the work described here . Myosin is a multiprotein complex composed of heavy chains and light chains . The heavy chains form the N - terminal motor domain , the central neck region , and the tail domain . The neck region of the heavy chain possesses IQ motifs that bind light chains . When bound to light chains , the neck region is referred to as the lever arm . 114 An IQ motif is 20 - 25 amino acids long containing the consensus sequence IQXXXRGXXXR which is widely found in all myosins . Two types of light chains known as Essential light chains ( ELCs ) and Regulatory light chains ( RLCs ) bind to myosin ( Figure 3 . 3A ) . The regulatory light chains are so named because they take part in the regulation of the enzymatic activity of myosin . 343 Similarly , the essential light chains are so termed because they can be removed from the myosin heavy chain only under harsh conditions ( high pH ) and upon removal of these chains , myosin loses its enzymatic activity . 344 3 . 2 . 2a Isoforms of MLCs Several isoforms of myosin light chains are known to exist . The RLC gene family found in humans include : MYL2 , MYL5 , MYL7 , MYL9 , MYL10 , MYL11 , MYL12A and MYL12B . The ELC gene family includes MYL1 , MYL3 , MYL4 , MYL6 , and MYL6B . 345 These isoforms are expressed in a tissue specific manner ; for example , ELCs MYL1 and MYL3 are expressed in human adult cardiac tissue , and MYL6 and MYL6B exist in non - muscle myosin - II . The isoform specific tissue distribution and cellular localization of MLCs is determined by the N - terminal region of the light chains which is variable between isoforms , while the C - terminal half shows high sequence conservation . 346 , 347 133 3 . 2 . 2b Structure and Binding of ELCs MLCs belong to the calmodulin ( CaM ) and CaM - related gene families ; thus , they show structural similarity to CaM . 111 , 348 CaM is a conserved intracellular Ca 2 + sensor that interacts with several proteins found in all eukaryotic cells . 349 Some non - conventional myosins bind CaM as light chains . 350 CaM is a dumbbell - shaped molecule consisting of an N - terminal and a C - terminal lobe separated by a central helix . 351 Each of the CaM lobes possess two helix - loop - helix motifs termed EF hands . The loop that connects two helices binds Ca 2 + which can coordinate with oxygen or nitrogen atoms of amino acids side or main polypeptide chain . In the absence of Ca 2 + , the EF hands adopt an antiparallel âclosedâ conformation , while in the presence of Ca 2 + , the EF hands are oriented in a perpendicular conformation called the âopenâ conformation ( Figure 3 . 3B ) . 352 Structural details of myosin ELC in the âfree - stateâ not bound to a heavy chain are not available . However , ELC and RLC bound to the neck region were observed in the crystal structure of myosin S1 ( 2MYS ) and scallop myosin regulatory domain ( 1WDC ) . 115 , 353 â 355 Like CaM , ELCs bound to eukaryotic myosins have 4 EF - hand motifs . 114 , 345 The N - terminal region of an ELC binds a heavy chain in a closed conformation and the C - terminus binds in a semi - open conformation winding around the heavy chain binding closely . 114 , 115 , 354 In the absence of myosin heavy chain , the N - and C - terminal lobe of the ELCs are suggested to adopt a closed conformation . 356 An alternative view suggests that the free ELCs exist in unfolded state ; this would explain why no structural data of the free form is available . 357 3 . 2 . 2c Functional Role of ELCs MLCs allosterically interact with myosin heavy chain and are critical for maintaining functional and structural integrity of the myosin . These chains are regulated either by cation binding or phosphorylation . Removal of light chains from myosin in vitro results in the collapse 134 of the alpha - helical neck domain due to exposure of the hydrophobic IQ motif . In the absence of an appropriate number of light chains , myosin will not hydrolyze ATP and the power stroke is compromised . 358 , 359 Vanburen et al . ( 1994 ) demonstrated the significance of ELC interaction in the actomyosin cycle by selective removal of ELC from chicken skeletal myosin where a 50 % reduction in the force generation was observed . 358 ELC mutations resulting in E10K and E13R charge reversal changes inhibit myosin actin activated myosin ATPase activity suggesting a prominent role in the mechano - enzymatic activity of smooth muscle myosin . 360 To conclude , ELCs play a critical role in the motor functions of myosin . 3 . 2 . 2d Role of ELC N - terminus The role of the ELCs N - termini in the regulation of muscle contraction has been investigated . Intact and skinned human cardiac muscle fibers reconstituted with N - terminal ELC synthetic peptides of varying lengths showed increased generation of isometric tension . 361 Proteolytic deletion of the first 13 amino acids from the N - terminus in rabbit skeletal and / or cardiac muscle ELC eliminated the Ca 2 + - induced reversible mobility of myosin head S1 away from the myosin filament backbone , a movement which is observed in normal myosin assemblies under physiological conditions . Such structural transitions are essential for the function of myosin filaments . 362 Cardiac ventricular ELC missing amino acids 5 - 14 showed decreased isometric tension with no change in Ca 2 + sensitivity in skinned ventricular strips . 363 Haase et al . ( 2006 ) showed that expression of a 15 N - terminal amino acid peptide of cardiac ELCs in transgenic mice was consistent with improved intrinsic contractility of isolated perfused hearts . 364 The kinetic parameters of actin - activated ATPase activity ( turnover ( k cat ) and dissociation constant ( K d ) for S1 with ELC lacking 13 amino acids from its N - terminus were larger than S1 containing ELC with an intact N - terminus . 365 135 3 . 2 . 2e Interaction of the ELC N - terminus with Actin A number of results indicate that the N - terminus of the ELCs expressed in striated muscles make contact with the negatively - charged C - terminus of actin . 341 , 366 â 369 Milligan et al . ( 1990 ) first presented evidence of interactions of the N - terminus of myosin ELC on F - actin using three dimensional maps of muscle thin filaments . 264 ELCs expressed in striated muscles are rich in lysines in the first 10 N - terminal amino acids and the remaining region has proline - alanine repeats . 75 , 370 , 371 The C - terminus of ELCs interact with myosin heavy chain and possibly the RLC . 114 , 354 The first experimental evidence of large structural changes in the N - terminal extension of ELC in the presence of actin was provided by 1 H - NMR . 372 Later , crosslinking experiments indicated interactions of the N - terminal positively - charged lysine residues of ELC from chicken skeletal muscle with the C - terminal acidic residues 360 - 363 of actin . 75 Further experiments using affinity chromatography and 1 H - NMR also suggested binding of the N - terminal region of ELC to actin . 368 The structural information on the first 46 amino acids of the N - terminus of ELC is missing from the chicken skeletal muscle myosin S1 crystal structure due to degradation of this region by papain . 114 Adylt et al . ( 2007 ) modeled this missing region onto a model of actin - myosinS1 complex . They proposed that the N - terminus is a rod - like structure rather than a helix that extends from myosin to its actin binding site on the filament . 373 It has been suggested that the proline - alanine repeats found in the N - terminal region forms an extended semi - rigid extension that allows interaction between lysine residues of the ELC and the C - terminal residues of actin . 373 , 374 Interestingly , another study has shown the proline - alanine repeats in the vicinity of the SH3 domain of myosin heavy chains suggesting a role of the N - terminus of ELC in modulating myosin ATPase activity . SH3 domain of myosin heavy chain is involved in ATPase activity of 136 myosin . 375 However , this experimental observation was conducted on actin filaments fully occupied with S1 where there is no interaction of actin with the ELC extension , a condition far from physiological . 366 Pliszka et al . ( 2001 ) further confirmed binding of the N - terminal region of ELC with a C - terminal fragment of S1 containing acidic amino acids . 376 It has been proposed that when myosin binds to actin with either no nucleotide or ADP bound , the N - terminal ELC extension interacts with the actin filament . This binding generates additional actin binding surface on the myosin head . Upon binding of ATP to myosin , myosin and the ELC retract from the actin filament and the N - terminal ELC region binds to the motor head domain . 357 Molecular modeling and experimental evidence strongly suggest that the ELC not only stabilizes the lever arm but also modulates the actomyosin system . However , structural details are not available for ELCs not bound to myosin or the N - terminal region that binds with actin during the actomyosin cycle . 357 Previous research indicates an important role of myosin ELC in modulating the interaction between actin and myosin during actomyosin force generation . Further research into the structural aspects of the interaction of ELC with regions of RLC , myosin and actin can provide new insights into the mechanism of muscle contraction . Since the lowest Q - score hit from my ADPr - trimer MS data analysis was MLC6B , the binding of MLC6B with ADPr - trimer was validated through a series of experiments , described in this chapter . 3 . 3 Methods 3 . 3 . 1 Affinity Resin Preparation Affigel - 10 resin ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ( Canada ) Ltd . , cat # 1536046 ) equilibrated with G - Hepes buffer ( 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM ATP ) was incubated with either G - actin 137 or ADPr - trimer in buffer without reducing agent for 60 min at 4â with continuous mixing . The reaction was terminated by washing G - affigel and 3mr - affigel with the blocking buffer ( 25 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM ATP ) . The resulting resin was stored at 4â in G - buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM Î² - ME , 0 . 002 % NaN 3 ) and used within a day of preparation . The binding capacity of affigel - 10 was determined to be 1 mg of G - actin or ADPr - trimer per mg of resin . The coupled resins were washed with buffer A ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 2 mM Î² - ME ) containing 200 mM NaCl to determine loss of either G - actin or ADPr - trimer from the resins . Gelsolin segment 4 - 6 ( G4 - 6 ) was bound to G - affigel and eluted to verify the functionality of the protein coupled to affigel - 10 . 3 . 3 . 2 Affinity Chromatography Preparation of Cell Lysate Zebrafish embryos were obtained from the Zebrafish facility in the Hagen Aqua lab , University of Guelph . About 120 , 5 dpf zebrafish embryos were lysed using glass beads in 1 . 5 mL of lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 05 % NP40 , 2 mM Î² - ME , Sigma protease inhibitor cocktail ( cat # P8340 ) ) . The lysate was clarified by spinning at 13000 Ã g for 10 min at 4â . The protein concentration in the lysate was determined with the Thermo Scientific , Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ( cat # 23225 ) . Affinity Chromatography G - affigel and 3mr - affigel were equilibrated with buffer A ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 2 mM Î² - ME ) . The clarified lysate containing 3 . 4 mgs of total protein was applied to 100 Î¼L of G - affigel resin to remove G - actin binding proteins . The flow - 138 through from G - affigel was applied to 50 or 100 Î¼L of 3mr - affigel . Following binding , each of the resins were washed with buffer A , buffer B ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 2 mM Î² - ME ) and again with buffer A to remove any salt . The resulting resins were stored at - 80â in buffer A . 3 . 3 . 3 Identification of ABPs by Mass Spectrometry Frozen G - and 3mr - affigel ( 50 and 100 Î¼L ) samples were analyzed at the SPARC BioCentre at SickKids as a fee - for - use service . The proteins on the resin were digested by trypsin and the resulting peptides were analyzed on the Q Exactive HF - X hybrid quadrupole - Orbitrap mass spectrometer . The data analysis was executed on Proteome Discoverer software compatible with Sequest HT search engine configured to search the UniProt database . Identified proteins had at least one unique peptide identified , and protein abundance values were obtained by chromatographic peak intensity measurements . A total of 215 - 230 proteins were identified for G - affigel replicates and 260 - 280 proteins were identified for 3mr - affigel replicates . An initial list of eight proteins binding to 3mr - affigel was generated using the presence / absence approach ( Supplemental table 1 ) . Based on this approach , the proteins that bound to G - affigel were eliminated and the proteins that appeared in all three 50 Î¼L and 100 Î¼L 3mr - affigel samples were shortlisted . Each hit was then ranked based on their Q - value and those proteins with only one peptide detected were removed . Finally , an in silico search of potential interactors was done to define biological processes , and molecular functions of the hits . 3 . 3 . 4 MLC6B Purification MLC6B was overexpressed in E . coli BL21 cells that were transformed with a kanamycin resistant pET - 28b vector containing the mlc6b gene with an N - terminal His 6 tag synthesized by Bio Basic Canada Inc . ( Markham , ON ) . Starter culture was initiated by inoculating 50 mL of 139 Lysogeny Broth ( LB ) containing 50 Î¼g / mL kanamycin with a single colony of transformed BL21 cells grown on LB plates . Expression culture was started by adding 50 mL starter culture into 500 mL of LB . Cells were grown at 37â until the cell density ( A 600 ) reached a value of approximately 0 . 6 before induction with 1 mM isopropyl - 1 - thio - Î² - D - galactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Cells were harvested 3 hours post - induction by centrifugation at 5 , 000 x g for 10 min . Cell pellets were resuspended in 40 mL of binding buffer per litre of culture ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM PMSF , 10 mM imidazole , Î² - ME 0 . 1 % v / v protease inhibitors ( benzamidine , TLCK , TPCK , leupeptin ) . The resuspended cells were lysed using a French press at 16 , 000 psi . The lysate was centrifuged at 31 , 360 Ã g for 30 min . The clarified lysate was loaded onto a nickel - charged chelating Sepharose column washed with binding buffer and eluted with 0 - 100 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 . Elution fractions were run on SDS - PAGE gel and the fractions containing MLC6B were pooled . The resulting protein was dialyzed against storage buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) overnight at 4â . Then , 10 % glycerol and protease inhibitors ( 0 . 05 % v / v benzamidine , TLCK , TPCK , leupeptin ) were added and the protein was flash frozen and stored at - 80â . 3 . 3 . 5 Removal of 6xHistidine tag His 6 - tagged MLC6B was dialyzed into thrombin cleavage buffer ( 0 . 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 25 mM CaCl 2 ) overnight . 0 . 004 units of thrombin ( GE Healthcare , Picasaway NJ ) was added per Î¼g of protein and incubated overnight at 4â . The reaction was quenched with 2 mM PMSF . Cleaved His 6 - tag or any remaining His 6 - MLC6B was removed by incubating the reaction with Ni - NTA resin equilibrated in thrombin cleavage buffer . The flow through from the resin contained untagged MLC6B . His 6 - MLC6B and untagged MLC6B were run on SDS - PAGE . 140 3 . 3 . 6 Co - sedimentation Assay Co - sedimentation assays were performed for both His 6 - tagged and untagged MLC6B . Polymerized actin ( 5 Î¼M ) was incubated with 2 Î¼M MLC6B on ice for 30 min . F - actin alone and MLC6B alone were run as controls . The reactions were centrifuged at 95 , 000 rpm ( 392 , 499 x g ) for 15 min ( Beckman TLA - 100 rotor ) . The resulting pellet and supernatant were run on SDS - PAGE . 3 . 3 . 7 Preparation of HMM and Light Chain Exchange HMM ( Heavy meromyosin ) was prepared from full - length myosin extracted from rabbit soleus muscle . 116 Essential light chain exchange on HMM was performed following the protocol described by Weeds and Wagner ( 1977 ) . 377 HMM ex was prepared by incubating HMM and His 6 - MLC6B in a 1 : 5 molar ratio in exchange buffer ( 100 mM imidazole . HCl , pH 7 . 0 , 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT ) , and ammonium chloride was added to a final concentration of 4 . 7 M . The reaction was performed on ice with continuous mixing for 12 min and dialysed overnight against 3 mM imidazole . HCl , pH 7 . 0 , 6 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT to remove the ammonium chloride . HMM mock was prepared by incubating HMM with exchange buffer followed by dialysis . The proteins were flash frozen and stored at - 80â . HMM ex was further purified to remove any unbound light chains for Western blotting using the âdeadheadingâ method ( see Section 3 . 3 . 9 ) with slight modifications . HMM ex was sedimented with F - actin in the absence of ATP . The pellet was washed twice with 1x polymerization buffer and finally the HMM ex was released by adding ATP followed by centrifugation at 95 , 000 rpm ( 392 , 499 x g ) for 15 min ( Beckman TLA - 100 rotor ) . 3 . 3 . 8 Western Blot Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred onto PVDF ( polyvinylidene difluoride ) membrane for 60 min at 100 V in transfer buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 190 mM glycine and 141 20 % v / v methanol ) . Following the transfer , PVDF membrane was washed with TBST ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) and incubated in 5 % milk protein in TBST for 60 min to block non - specific binding . Blocked membranes were rinsed with TBST and incubated with anti - His antibody ( Clontech Laboratories Inc , A Takara Bio Company , cat # 631212 ) at 4â overnight on a rocking table . The next day the membrane was washed three times for 5 min each with TBST and incubated with secondary antibody ( goat anti - mouse antibody ) conjugated with horse - radish peroxidase ( Promega , cat # W4028 ) for 60 min at RT . The resulting membrane was washed with TBST . Proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) reagent ( Thermo Scientific Super Signal TM West Femto , cat # 34096 ) . 3 . 3 . 9 In Vitro Motility ( IVM ) Assay The IVM assay was performed as per Liang et al . ( 2003 ) and Viswanathan et al . ( 2017 ) , with some modifications . 378 , 379 Briefly , flow cells were created by adhering nitrocellulose - coated glass coverslips to microscope slides with double - sided tape . Any inactive myosin heads were removed by deadheading . HMM , HMM mock and HMM ex samples were incubated with F - actin in the absence of ATP , followed by centrifugation . The active myosin heads were released by the addition of ATP . Active HMM samples were bound to the nitrocellulose flow cell , followed by the addition of diluted rhodamine - phalloidin - labeled F - actin . Videos were captured for 15 s each at 2 mM and 0 . 1 M ATP concentration on a digital video camera mounted on a Quorum Deconvolution microscope ( Quorum Technologies Ltd . , Lewes , U . K . ) using a Texas red filter . Three videos were collected per assay for 2 mM ATP concentration . Analysis was performed to quantitate the velocity of motile filaments at 2 mM ATP concentrations for HMM , HMM mock and HMM ex . Videos were imported and analyzed in ImageJ . Up to ten filaments were selected based on directed movement ; if fewer than ten filaments were motile in a given video , only those that 142 showed movement were chosen . The distance covered by a single filament over a period of 10 frames was measured from the start and end point of a filament using the line tool . This data was recorded using the âMeasureâ command in ImageJ and saved as . xls files before being imported into a custom Microsoft Excel spreadsheet . Data collection was done by Grace Teng and IVM videos were analysed by Michael Jones , both graduate students in the Dawson Lab . Velocity data was obtained using following Equation : ð ( ðð ð  ) = ( ð· ð¹ ð¸âð¹ ð ) ð 89 . 46 ððððð¥ðð ð 2 . 48 ðððððð ð  1000 ðððð where D is the distance traveled in pixels , F E is the end frame number and F S is the start frame number . 3 . 3 . 10 Pull - down Assay 3mr - and BSA - affigel were prepared as described in Section 3 . 3 . 1 . A 100 Î¼g of 3mr or BSA was bound to 150 Î¼L of resin . 3mr - or BSA - affigel were incubated with 200 Î¼g of His 6 - MLC6B or HMM ex for 60 min at 4â with continuous shaking . The bound resins were washed with buffer A , buffer B and buffer C ( buffer B + 0 . 05 % NP40 ) . Loading buffer was added to the washed resins and run on SDS - PAGE gel for Western blotting as described in section 3 . 3 . 8 . 3 . 4 Results The stability of coupling of G - actin and ADPr - trimer to affigel - 10 was confirmed by washing the coupled resins with lysis buffer , buffer A and buffer B . SDS - PAGE of the washes confirmed no loss of ADPr - trimer or G - actin from either G - or 3mr - affigel , respectively ( Figure 3 . 4A ) . The functionality and specificity of actin coupled to affigel was confirmed by incubating 143 Figure 3 . 4 8 % SDS - PAGE of stability of the G - and 3mr - affinity resins . A ) G - affigel and 3mr - affigel were prepared by incubating affigel - 10 with G - actin or ADPr - trimer . The resulting resins were washed with lysis buffer and buffer with 50 mM KCl . Washes and resulting resins were run on 8 % SDS - PAGE . G - actin alone and ADPr - trimer alone were run as controls . No loss of G - actin or ADPr - trimer was observed from washing the resins with buffers . B ) 8 % SDS - PAGE of G4 - 6 binding to G - affigel . Tris - affigel or G - affigel were incubated with G4 - 6 for 2 hours at 4â . After binding the resin was washed with lysis buffer / wash 1 and 50 mM KCl buffer B / wash 2 . G4 - 6 was eluted with EGTA - containing buffer . Washes , elution fraction and resins after elution were run on SDS - PAGE . G4 - 6 bound to and eluted from G - affigel resin . A B G - actin G4 - 6 G - actin ADPr - trimer 144 G - affigel with G4 - 6 , a protein with high affinity for G - actin . 193 G4 - 6 bound to and eluted from G - affigel . Tris - affigel , which was run as control , did not bind G4 - 6 ( Figure 3 . 4B ) . The proteins retained on G - and 3mr - affigel from 5 dpf zebrafish embryo cell lysates were identified by MS . Based on the presence / absence approach and ranking the proteins by their Q values , we identified eight protein hits binding to 3mr - affigel in six samples ( 3 x 50 Î¼L + 3 x 100 Î¼L 3mr - affigel ) . Four of these identified hits with more than one unique peptide were identified and selected for validation ( Table 3 . 1 ) . Since MLC6B ranked highest on the list and the literature suggests interactions between actin and MLCs , His 6 - tagged MLC6B was purified in the lab for validation of the interaction observed by MS ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . I hypothesized that MLC6B will bind F - actin since MLC6B was identified as interacting with ADPr - trimer by MS . However , no interaction between these proteins was observed in the co - sedimentation assay ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . Since the N - terminus of essential myosin light chains like MLC6B interact with actin , the N - terminal His 6 - tag might interfere with the binding of MLC6B to F - actin . However , untagged MLC6B with the His 6 - tag cleaved using thrombin ( Figure 3 . 7A ) did not bind to F - actin in the co - sedimentation assay ( Figure 3 . 7B ) . 75 , 370 , 371 To explain the lack of binding of MLC6B to F - actin , I tested the idea that MLC6B might exist in an inactive or unfolded state when not bound the IQ motif in the myosin heavy chain lever arm . 356 , 357 Native ELCs on HMM were exchanged with His 6 - MLC6B ( HMM ex ) followed by co - sedimentation with F - actin . A signal for HMM ex with an anti - His antibody in the Western blot confirmed replacement of native ELCs on HMM with His 6 - MLC6B ( Figure 3 . 8A ) . Since ELCs play a role in the force and motion generation during actin - myosin interaction , the exchange was further confirmed by an IVM assay where a decrease in actin filament velocity was observed 145 Table 3 . 1 Prioritized list of ADPr - trimer binding candidates . A zebrafish cell lysate was pre - cleared with G - affigel to remove G - actin binding proteins before incubating with 3mr - affigel . 3mr - bound proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry and identified hits were ranked based on Q - value and number of peptides identified . 146 Figure 3 . 5 15 % SDS - PAGE of purification of His - MLC6B . His - MLC6B expressed in E . coli was purified on 5 mL Ni - NTA column using an imidazole gradient of 1 - 100 mM in the elution buffer . The elution fractions run on SDS - PAGE show a His - MLC6B band . The fractions containing MLC6B were pooled , dialyzed against storage buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM DTT ) and concentrated . Then , 10 % glycerol was added , and the protein stored at - 80 â . 147 Figure 3 . 6 F - actin co - sedimentation assays for His - MLC6B . 5 Î¼M of F - actin was incubated with 2 Î¼M His - MLC6B on ice for 30 min . The reaction was spun at 95000 rpm ( 392 , 499 x g ) for 15 min ( Beckman TLA - 100 rotor ) and run on 15 % SDS - PAGE . F - actin alone and untagged - MLC6B alone were run as controls . The presence of His - MLC6B in the supernatant fraction ( S / N ) indicated no interaction between His - MLC6B and F - actin . 148 Figure 3 . 7 Untagged MLC6B ( MLC6B ) . A ) Thrombin cleavage of His - tag from His - MLC6B . His - MLC6B was incubated with 0 . 004 units of thrombin per mg of His - MLC6B in thrombin cleavage buffer overnight at 4â . The reaction was inactivated by adding 2 mM PMSF . Cleaved His - tag or undigested His - MLC6B were removed by incubating the reaction with Ni - NTA resin . His - MLC6B , MLC6B ( untagged ) and the resin were run on 15 % SDS - PAGE . B ) 15 % SDS - PAGE of F - actin co - sedimentation assays for untagged - MLC6B . 5 Î¼M of F - actin was incubated with 2 Î¼M untagged - MLC6B on ice for 30 min . The reaction was spun at 95 , 000 rpm ( 392 , 499 x g ) for 15 min ( Beckman TLA - 100 rotor ) . The presence of His - MLC6B in the S / N fraction indicated no interaction between untagged - MLC6B and F - actin . A B 149 Figure 3 . 8 Exchange of MLC6B on HMM . A ) Western Blot analysis of exchange of His - MLC6B on HMM . Native ELCs on HMM were exchanged with His - MLC6B . The exchange was detected using anti - His antibody . HMM with native ELCs were run as negative control , His - MLC6B and His - G4 - 6 were run as positive controls . The appearance of signal for HMM ex confirmed exchange . B ) Sliding velocities for F - actin were measured over HMM , HMM mock and HMM ex in presence of 2mM ATP . HMM mock and HMM ex exhibited velocities 38 % and 10 % that of HMM . Removal of ELCs from HMM mock and replacement of native ELCs with MLC6B in HMM ex impacted the sliding velocities of actin in the assay . The average velocities for the measurements are plotted Â±Standard Error . The velocity of actin filaments over HMM ex was significantly lower than the native HMM ( p = 0 . 042 ) . IVM experiment and data analysis were performed by Grace Teng and Michael Jones , respectively , graduate students in the Dawson lab . A B 150 Figure 3 . 9 Western Blot analysis of pull - down assay showing binding of HMMex and MLC6B to 3mr - affigel . 3mr - affigel was incubated with HMM ex or His - MLC6B . BSA - affigel was run as negative control . HMM ex and His - MLC6B bound to 3mr - affigel were detected with anti - His antibody . His - MLC6B alone was run as a control . Additional bands besides the His - MLC6B band on the blot represent truncated or dimeric forms of full length His - MLC6B . 151 compared to native HMM ( Figure 3 . 8B ) . 358 HMM mock was run as negative control to determine the effect of buffer treatment and removal of ELCs from HMM . HMM with native light chains bound was run as a positive control . The velocity of HMM mock and HMM ex was 38 % and 10 % that of native HMM , respectively ( Figure 3 . 8B ) . Although MLC6B did not appear to interact with F - actin , the appearance of a signal in the Western blot from pull - down assays of 3mr - affgel incubated with HMM ex or MLC6B alone suggested interactions of ADPr - trimer with both HMM ex and His 6 - MLC6B . Almost no HMM ex bound to the negative control BSA - affigel ( Figure 3 . 9 ) . 3 . 5 Discussion and Conclusion MS data was analysed using the presence / absence approach which eliminated further investigation of non - specific or background interactors or the need for more replicates for statistical analysis . MLC6B was identified as the top hit in the list of potential ADPr - trimer interactors . MLC6B is an ELC found in the smooth muscles of zebrafish . An earlier structure of myosin found ELCs bound to the heavy chain of myosin . 114 Later , crosslinking and fluorescent probe experiments indicated that the N - terminus of ELCs interacts with actin . 342 , 366 , 380 The interaction was confirmed by an EM structure in which additional electron density was seen close to the C - terminus of actin . 264 However , the N - terminus of the ELC was not resolved in the crystal structures of myosin S1 , likely due to high mobility in the absence of F - actin . 381 Since ADPr - trimer possesses F - actin like properties , I thought that recombinant MLC6B should bind F - actin . However , co - sedimentation assays suggested no interaction between F - actin and MLC6B . Considering that the N - terminal amino acids of ELCs are known to interact with C - terminal residues of actin , the N - terminal His 6 - tag on recombinant MLC6B could be interfering with the interaction . Hence , the N - terminal His 6 - tag on MLC6B was cleaved using thrombin , but again no 152 interaction between untagged MLC6B and F - actin was observed . Some researchers have proposed that in the unbound form , the N - and C - terminus of ELCs exists in a closed conformation , while others suggested that when not bound to the heavy chain , ELCs exists in an unfolded state which has hindered complete structural determination of the free form of light chains . 356 , 357 No crosslinking was observed between isolated A1 ( an ELC found in skeletal muscle ) and F - actin , in contrast to when A1 was bound to S1 when crosslinking occurred . 382 Since the MLC6B in the cell lysate used for MS was likely bound to myosin , native ELCs on HMM were exchanged with His 6 - tagged recombinant MLC6B . The exchange was confirmed by Western blot and changes in velocity in IVM assays . The Western blot showed a signal for HMM ex with anti - His antibody . Interestingly , a significant decrease in the sliding velocity of the actin filaments was observed for HMM ex compared to HMM and HMM mock . Actin filaments exhibited little to no movement over HMM ex at a concentration of 2 mM ATP ; however , in the presence of 0 . 1 M ATP , the filaments detached from the HMM ex heads ( Supplemental figure 7 ) . Such an observation is indicative of altered actomyosin interaction kinetic parameters ( k cat and K M ) being influenced by the light chains present on the heavy chains resulting in impaired interactions and slower movement of actin filaments . The altered kinetic parameters could be the result of either an influence on the release of myosin ATP hydrolysis products or slower association between actin and myosin - ADP + Pi ( see Section 1 . 3 . 1b in chapter 1 for steps of the actomyosin cycle ) . 377 Light chains of myosin are required for generation of movement . Trybus and Chatman ( 1993 ) showed that the velocity of actin was similar over skeletal heavy chain with skeletal LCs or chimeras of skeletal and smooth LCs . However , the results contradicted the findings where smooth muscle heavy chain with added skeletal RLC completely inhibited both ATPase activity 153 and actin motility . 383 Removal of light chains from HMM reduced the velocity of actin filaments significantly ( almost 10x ) from 8 . 8 Î¼ms - 1 to 0 . 8 Î¼ms - 1 without significantly impacting the ATPase activity ; however , reconstitution of myosin with the complete set of light chains restored the sliding velocity to normal . 359 Thus , LCs are critical for conversion of chemical energy to motion in actomyosin force generation . It has been observed that skeletal myosin carrying A1 type ELC ( S1 ( A1 ) ) containing an N - terminal region that interacts with actin moves actin filaments slower than myosin carrying A2 type ELC ( S1 ( A2 ) ) missing the actin - binding N - terminus . This slower gliding velocity could be due to the A1 isoform binding to actin . 359 A difference in ATPase kinetic parameters of myosin was reported depending on the form of the two ELC isoenzymes present . Myosin S1 containing light chain A1 had a lower K M for actin and slower turnover of MgATP ( k cat ) than S1 ( A2 ) . 342 Wagner and Weeds ( 1977 ) also reported in their hybridization experiments that the k cat for S1 ( A2 ) was twice that of S1 ( A1 ) and the ratio for K M was 4 : 1 . 377 Pull - down assays with 3mr - affigel indicated binding of both HMM ex and His 6 - MLC6B to ADPr - trimer confirming MS results . Timson et al . ( 1998 ) demonstrated that both free and S1 - bound ELC crosslinked to actin . 342 In contrast to a previous study , the crosslinking was attributed to the protocol in which molecules were allowed to come to equilibrium before adding the crosslinker . 382 The heavy chain of S1 is known to direct the binding of ELC on actin , but it is likely that in a less structured free state in solution , the N - terminal actin binding site of ELC was exposed to solvent allowing crosslinking . 342 , 384 Interestingly , MLC6B in both the HMM - bound and free states interacted with ADPr - trimer , although no such interaction was observed with F - actin in co - sedimentation assays . The N - terminal basic amino acids of ELCs interact with acidic amino acids in the C - terminus of the 154 actin . 75 The same highly flexible C - terminus of actin participates in intersubunit interactions within the filament and might require binding of myosin heavy chain to orient the C - terminus of actin to bind ELC . 61 , 62 However , in the case of ADPr - trimer , the penultimate C - terminal Cys - 374 is involved in and stabilized by pPBM crosslinking and may adopt a fixed conformation that allows interaction with MLC6B even though ADPr - trimer itself does not bind myosin as described in Section 2 . 2 of chapter 2 . Alternatively , the ribosyl groups at the Arg - 177 of each actin subunit at the intersubunit interaction site might place the actin subunit in the trimer in an orientation that favours MLC6B binding . Further investigation using PBM - crosslinked actin filaments is required to evaluate these possibilities . The binding functionality of G - actin coupled to affigel - 10 was confirmed by binding and elution of G4 - 6 from G - affigel . However , my results present interaction of MLC6B with ADPr - trimer only when coupled to affigel - 10 , therefore the possibility of altered conformation of ADPr - trimer resulting from overcoupling of the primary amines with the resin cannot be ruled out . This issue can be resolved by performing reverse pull - down of ADPr - trimer on MLC6B coupled resin . 3 . 6 Future Directions Altered kinetic properties of HMM upon replacement of light chains can be studied with myosin ATPase assays . Together with IVM data , the ATPase assay data will provide information on ELCs in the regulation of the mechanochemical actomyosin interaction . The hypothesis that stabilization of the C - terminus by crosslinking facilitates the binding of MLC6B on ADPr - trimer can be validated by using PBM - crosslinked F - actin in co - sedimentation assays . Upon confirmation of the interaction , the structure of MLC6B bound to F - dimer ( actin filaments formed by polymerization of PBM - crosslinked actin dimers ) can be determined using cryo - EM . Based on the hypothesis that MLC6B binds to the crosslinked C - terminus end of actin , MLC6B would bind 155 along one side of the F - dimer filament . Alternatively , based on the results of pull - down assays , a heterocomplex of MLC6B bound to ADPr - trimer can be purified for single particle cryo - EM structural determination . MLC6B could be in either its free form or bound to a recombinantly - expressed myosin IQ motif . If required , the resulting complex can be stabilized by crosslinkers for purification . Finally , future work also involves validating and characterizing interactions of other F - ABPs identified by MS ( Table 1 ) . While no literature regarding direct interaction with actin was found for Î± - 1 , 4 glucan phosphorylase , the literature suggests a role for tyrosine 3 - monooxygenase activation protein and RAB2A in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Tyrosine 3 - monooxygenase / tryptophan 5 - monooxygenase activation protein / beta polypeptide - like protein is a member of the 14 - 3 - 3 family . Members of this family are known to play a role in cellular trafficking and actin dynamics through interactions with LIM kinase , cofilin and other actin binding proteins . 385 â 387 One of the known mechanisms by which 14 - 3 - 3 proteins regulate actin dynamics is through sequestration of phosphorylated cofilin . 386 , 387 However , multiple isoforms of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins exist in eukaryotes leading to inconsistent results as to whether 14 - 3 - 3 proteins interact directly with actin . In Giardia lambila , a protozoan parasite that lacks cofilin and other canonical ABPs , 14 - 3 - 3 protein was found associated with actin . 388 The 14 - 3 - 3 protein sigma isoform forms a complex with actin in breast cancer cells and regulates cell motility during invasion . 388 Another hit identified by MS , RAB2A is a member of the Ras - related family of low - molecular weight GTP - binding proteins . RAB proteins regulate vesicular transport pathways including formation of vesicles , actin and tubulin - dependent vesicle movement and specific targeting to and fusion with the membranes . 389 â 391 No evidence of direct binding between RAB2A 156 and F - actin was found in the literature , since it is yet to be established how RABs and their binding partners regulate the cytoskeleton near membranes . It has been suggested that myosin initiates nucleation of its actin track around vesicles and that RAB binding controls an enzyme promoting actin assembly . 392 , 393 Discussing the details of the pathways and multiprotein complexes involved in the interaction of Tyrosine 3 - monooxygenase / tryptophan 5 - monooxygenase activation protein and RAB2A is beyond the scope of this work . However , further investigation of the potential of direct or indirect interactions of these proteins through the formation of multiprotein complexes can reveal insights of actin dynamics regulation and open new perspectives for structural investigation . The above listed proteins can be recombinantly expressed and purified in the lab with gene synthesis from industrial sources . Alternatively , purified recombinant homologs of these proteins from other species can be purchased . MyBioSource Inc .

Why short F - actin oligomers ? Filamentous systems such as actin form the cytoskeleton and play an essential role in the cell division and muscular contraction . They interact with a large number of proteins to maintain homeostasis of the cell , and are thus associated with many diseases , particularly myopathies , cancer and neurodegeneration . 394 â 396 Understanding how actin assembles , disassembles , interacts with itself and a large number of ABPs depends on understanding the structure of actin filaments . The challenge researchers face is the fundamental property of actin to self - associate that hinders crystallization studies . The crystal structure of monomeric actin was determined and information on how monomers fit together into the polymer was known at a low resolution of 8 . 4 Ã until 1990 . 52 , 96 , 397 Since crystallization is the mainstay technique for atomic resolution determination of proteins , one approach adopted by researchers was to crystallize small oligomers of actin to reveal interactions at binding interfaces . 72 , 398 , 399 These defined oligomers were obtained by limited crosslinking in either lateral or longitudinal directions and inhibiting polymerization by chemical modifications . 69 , 71 , 400 , 401 However , these modifications can impact the interactions among actin subunits within the oligomer and with their binding partners , resulting in a complex with altered biological significance . Some of the crystal structures of short F - actin oligomers provided an idea of interactions between subunits , while in others , the subunits did not adopt a conformation representing F - actin or were incompatible with the known F - actin structures . 72 , 73 , 103 For example , interactions of ANP - crosslinked actin dimer with myosin remained relatively unchanged , but 158 DNase I and G1 binding to the dimers to inhibit polymerization resulted in loss of productive interactions with myosin . 400 , 402 , 403 Similarly , crystal structures of oligomers with polymerization inhibition by TMR , latrunculin A or G1 did not present a conformation representing F - actin and were incompatible with known F - actin structures . 72 , 73 , 103 A strategic balance of chemical modifications with a minimalistic approach was required to generate oligomers that function as an F - actin - like scaffold . Over 10 years of research and biochemical investigations in the Dawson lab culminated in the production of ADPr - trimer as an F - actin scaffold . Actin subunits in the ADPr - trimer were held together by introducing crosslinks in the adjacent actin subunits in the filament followed by depolymerization . An ADPr - ribose moiety was bound at Arg - 177 of each actin subunit at intersubunit interaction sites , suggesting conformational flexibility in the ADPr - trimer . Although the presence of crosslinking might introduce constraints overcoming perturbations caused by the ribose moiety , potential disruptions of intermolecular contacts by stoichiometric ADP - ribosylation cannot be ignored . The binding of DNase I or gelsolin to ADPr - trimer indicated an intact pointed end and barbed end , respectively . In my thesis , I extended this research by investigating the interaction of the ADPr - trimer with side binder proteins , myosin S1 and cofilin . Since there are over 100 known ABPs , the search for ADPr - trimer interacting proteins was expanded using ADPr - trimer affinity resin to pull - down binding partners from a cell lysate followed by identification by mass spectrometry . Gelsolin and cofilin bind , S1 does not bind ADPr - trimer The results of my research indicated that myosin S1 does not bind ADPr - trimer , while cofilin and gelsolin bind to the ADPr - trimer . Such findings suggest that cofilin and S1 have different mechanisms of binding to the side of actin filaments and induce distinct conformational changes . ABPs can induce specific conformational changes that propagates along the filament . 279 159 Ngo et al . ( 2016 ) showed that both cofilin and myosin bind co - operatively to F - actin , but in a mutually exclusive manner . It has been suggested that conformational changes in the actin filaments contribute to the mutually exclusive cooperative binding of myosin II and cofilin . 278 This spatial and temporal regulation of ABPs binding to F - actin is yet to be understood . According to one view , in addition to biochemical signalling , mechanical stimuli can regulate ABP binding . 404 , 405 For example , stretched filaments do not bind cofilin in vivo and in vitro , whereas an increased affinity for such filaments is observed for myosin II in vivo . 405 , 406 Another view suggests that ABPs introduce local structural changes in F - actin , leading to differentiation of mutually exclusive ABP binding sites along a single filament . Cofilin and myosin II introduce opposite changes in the helical twist of the filament . 405 , 407 , 408 While cofilin supertwists the helix , 157 , 409 , 410 myosin slightly untwists the filament in the absence of ATP . 411 , 412 Perhaps these different twist changes explain the mutually exclusive nature of myosin and cofilin binding to F - actin . The different twists induced by myosin and cofilin also suggest why cofilin binds ADPr - trimer while myosin does not . I suggest that the presence of the ADPr - modification inhibits the untwisting required for myosin binding while accommodating the supertwist seen with cofilin . To test this model , one could compare the structure of ADPr - trimer alone and to the structure of F - actin with myosin bound , focussing on the position of the ADPr - modification and its likelihood of inhibiting conformational shifts needed for myosin binding . In addition , studying the ADPr - trimer : cofilin filamentous assemblies can likely reveal a different mode of binding and filament stabilization by cofilin . Like cofilin , gelsolin bound to ADPr - trimer . Interestingly , Van Troy et al . ( 1997 ) used small peptide fragments of cofilin and the G2 segment of gelsolin to show that both cofilin and G2 160 segment share common binding sites . 413 Since both full - length cofilin and gelsolin bound to the same short F - actin structure , results described in this thesis support Van Troyâs findings . The selective binding of ABPs to ADPr - trimer indicate disruption of particular intersubunit interactions required for some ABP binding . ADP - ribosylated monomeric actin interacts with ABPs , such as DNAse I , vitamin D binding protein , thymosin B4 , cofilin , gelsolin segment 1 and myosin S1 , but when present in a trimer , the ADPr - modification distorts the binding sites for myosin S1 and potentially other F - actin binding proteins . 275 However , the hetADPr - trimer produced by a combination of crosslinking and polymerization inhibition by G1 and ribosylation did bind myosin S1 . 104 It is yet to be established if hetADPr - trimer is the smallest F - actin unit that can support myosin force generation . This can be determined by monitoring motility of fluorescently labelled myosin over het - trimer - coated surfaces . 280 â 282 Thus , modifying filamentous systems to produce oligomers that bind ABPs can alter binding interfaces for some ABPs , though some binding properties of F - actin are retained . However , the physiological significance of such complexes needs to be determined . Despite the possibility of deformation of intersubunit interactions or the binding interface for F - ABPs due to chemical modifications , the hetADPr - trimer did show that a suitable combination of modifications can lead to an actin oligomer that binds to myosin . However , the heterogeneity of modifications makes the hetADPr - trimer : S1 complex unsuitable for crystallization . Similarly , the gelsolin bound ADPr - trimer was non - crystallizable . Nevertheless , a cryo - EM approach can be applied to such non - crystallizable bio - complexes for structural determination . 161 Does ADPr - trimer mimic any biological state of F - actin ? ADPr - trimer binds selectively to cofilin and gelsolin but not S1 , all of which are F - actin side - binding proteins . Potentially , ribosylation inhibits the relative movement of the subunits required for presenting binding interface for S1 , but allows super twisting that supports cofilin binding . Alternatively , since both gelsolin and cofilin bind to G - actin , these proteins could be binding to individual actin subunits within ADPr - trimer through their G - actin binding sites . 204 , 289 Additional bands seen on the native gel for gelsolin - ADPr - trimer reactions prior to purification suggests binding of more than one gelsolin to ADPr - trimer through their G - actin binding segments ( G1 or / and G4 - 6 ) ( Supplemental figure 5 ) . Negative stain EM data shows heterogeneity which could result from multiple modes of gelsolin binding to ADPr - trimer . G1 and G4 - 6 segments can bind to any two actin subunits within the ADPr - trimer while , G2 ( F - actin binding segment ) either binds to two longitudinally associated actin subunits or remains unbound adopting various conformations ( Supplemental figure 6 ) . In future , binding of recombinantly expressed G2 segment to the ADPr - trimer can be verified using physical assays , such as native gel . ADPr - trimer pull - down assays from zebra fish cell lysate presented MLC6B as a binding partner of ADPr - trimer , but not G - actin . The literature supports the role of interaction of N - terminus of ELCs with the C - terminus of actin during actomyosin force generation . 75 I suggest that binding of MLC6B to ADPr - trimer could be the result of the restrained C - terminus of actin subunits ; however , any alterations in the conformation of ADPr - trimer upon coupling to resin cannot be ignored . Since ELC extracted from rabbit skeletal muscle has been shown to bind to G - actin in a crosslinking experiment , binding of MLC6B to 3mr - affigel does not confirm F - actin like interaction with ADPr - trimer . 384 162 Considering that cofilin , gelsolin and MLC6B can bind to G - actin raises questions on the validity of ADPr - trimer as a biologically relevant mimic of F - actin . Since no structural data is available , a concrete conclusion on if any F - actin like interactions are retained in ADPr - trimer cannot be drawn . Hence , using ADPr - trimer as a short - F - actin scaffold for future structural studies with F - ABPs stays questionable and must be considered carefully . Application of cryo - EM to filamentous systems has revealed near atomic resolution structures , thus utility of modified short F - actin oligomers for structural studies needs to be reconsidered . 4 - 9 However , the hetADPr - trimer that binds to S1 can be used for biophysical assays . HetADPr - trimer could be used to establish if trimer is the smallest F - actin unit that can support movement or long range interactions between actin subunits is required for actomyosin motility . Cryo - EM : Application to short F - actin oligomers and filamentous form Since the application of cryo - EM with direct electron detectors to F - actin in 2015 , the year I began my research , cryo - EM has revolutionized F - actin structural studies . I therefore initiated a pipeline for cryo - EM work in the Dawson lab using resources available on campus . From the first F - actin reconstruction obtained at a resolution of 40 Ã , which revealed the helical structure and two large domains , to the most recent structure at 3 . 1 Ã resolution with visible side chains and nucleotides , the field of cryo - EM has seen significant advances and has been extended to actin filaments decorated with myosin and other ABPs yielding near atomic resolution structural information ( Supplemental Table 1 , 2 ) . 9 , 127 , 266 , 412 , 414 The resolution revolution in past 5 - 6 years has been attributed to the development of direct electron detectors , microscope automation and image processing tools . 163 With EM work extended to F - actin and F - actin bound ABPs , one might argue that we no longer need short F - actin oligomers . However , F - actin is dynamic and exists in multiple states . 55 , 277 Therefore , crosslinking might still be useful for isolating specific states of F - actin . For instance , crosslinked actin filaments exhibit a state that binds myosin , but inhibits myosin motility , and I have already shown that the ADPr - trimer does not bind S1 , but binds cofilin and gelsolin . 71 MLC6B bound ADPr - trimer but not F - actin in my co - sedimentation experiments and was identified as the top - most hit in my MS results . This result suggests that crosslinking held the ADPr - trimer in a conformation preferred for MLC6B binding . Thus , crosslinking can be used to isolate specific states of F - actin to study its interaction with binding partners . There is evidence that the conformation of the C - terminus of actin is involved in some ABP binding . 266 Since Cys - 374 , the penultimate amino acid of actin , participates in the PBM crosslink , I believe that modification of the C - terminus is involved with the affinity of MLC6B for ADPr - trimer . There is evidence that the N - termini of some MLCs interact with the C - terminus of actin , supporting my model . 368 , 373 , 415 In addition to MLC6B , Kim et al . ( 2002 ) showed that in vitro motility of crosslinked F - actin by myosin is reduced . I believe this reduced motility is due to the role of the actin C - terminus in myosin force generation . 71 I tested this hypothesis with filaments made exclusively from crosslinked dimers or trimers and have preliminary results suggesting that the reduction in gliding velocity of crosslinked filaments is proportional to the percentage of crosslinked - restricted C - termini ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . Future experiments can follow up on these results with cryo - EM structural determination of myosin S1 - decorated actin filaments consisting exclusively of crosslinked - dimer ( called F - dimer ) . The C - termini of the subunits in one strand of F - dimer are constrained in the crosslink , while the C - termini on the other strand are free to move . If my hypothesis is correct , the lever arms of all myosin S1 on the constrained side of the 164 filament should be in the pre - powerstroke state ( therefore they do not produce force ) , while the myosin on the opposite strand will be in the post - powerstroke state after producing force . Modifying filamentous actin can pose challenges , but a balanced approach can be used to isolate specific states of F - actin and to study interactions with ABPs , including the mechanical regulation of binding . Further development in EM imaging and computational work are transforming the landscape of structural determination of filamentous systems . In the future , further advances in cryo - electron tomography can be applied to observe filamentous structures within cells . Although the cost is significant and current demand for the high resolution cryo - EM instrumentation is outstripping supply , it is anticipated that the rapid expansion in the field of cryo - EM will provide a significant understanding of cellular machines in the coming decade . My research aimed to characterize the interactions of myosin S1 , cofilin and gelsolin with ADPr - trimer structurally and biochemically . This approach was refined by including advances in proteomics and structural biology . An unbiased approach using the combination of pull - down assays and MS led to the identification of proteins from cell lysates that bind the ADPr - trimer . MLC6B was identified as the top hit and binding of MLC6B to ADPr - trimer was verified by pull - down assays performed with purified His 6 - MLC6B . The MS approach generated a list of other potential interactors of ADPr - trimer . In the future , the interaction of these binding partners with ADP - trimer can be characterized using physical and biochemical assays leading to structural studies . Setting the stage to determine the structure of the GSFL : 3mr complex with state - of - the - art high - resolution cryo - electron microscopy was accomplished by establishing a workflow at Guelph , not only for future structural determination of short F - actin complexes and F - actin but also for other non - crystallizable biomolecules . The identification of ABPs through proteomics and the workflow established for cryo - EM structural determination will advance our understanding of 165 the different ways F - ABPs interact with F - actin and the critical role of these interactions in regulating eukaryotic cell function and life . 166 5 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1 .

A ) 8 % SDS - PAGE of crosslinked oligomers purified on a gel filtration column . Actin extracted from turkey acetone powder was polymerized and crosslinked with pPBM . The crosslinked ( CL ) oligomers were depolymerized and resolved by iterations of gel filtration chromatography . B ) Graphical representation of motilities of crosslinked oligomers derived from in vitro motility assay . F - dimer and F - trimer show 70 % and 31 % sliding velocity , respectively compared to uncrosslinked F - actin . Trimer and dimer preparations show some contaminating dimer and monomer band , respectively . IVM was performed by Grace Teng , a graduate student in the Dawson lab . B A 199 Supplemental Figure 2 ADPr - monomer binds to cofilin . A ) Analytical size - exclusion chromatogram of binding reactions containing ADPr : monomer and cofilin . A mixture of 10 Î¼M ADPr - monomer and 10 Î¼M cofilin in Super G - buffer or 10 Î¼M of ADPr - monomer alone were incubated on ice for 60 min . The reactions were developed on a Superdex 200 ( 10 / 300 ) analytical gel filtration column equilibrated with Super G - buffer . A shift in the elution peak for the reaction with ADPr : monomer and cofilin confirmed formation of a complex . B ) 10 % Native - PAGE of purification of Cof : 1mr complex for crystal trials . 176 . 5 Î¼M of ADPr - monomer was incubated with equimolar amount of cofilin overnight at 4â and developed on Superdex 200 ( 10 / 300 ) . The eluted fractions were run on a native gel . Fractions containing pure Cof : 1mr complex were pooled and concentrated for setting - up crystal trials . However , no crystals were obtained for the complex . A B 200 Supplemental Figure 3 10 % Silver stained native - PAGE of binding reactions of cofilin . Reactions containing 1 . 4 Î¼M of ADPr - monomer , or Long - dimer and 1 . 4 Î¼M of cofilin were incubated for 60 min at RT in Super - G buffer . ADPr : monomer or Long : dimer alone was run as controls on the gel . A band shift was observed for reactions with cofilin and ADPr - monomer or long - dimer suggesting binding . Additional bands in the ADPr - monomer lane resulted from the aggregation of protein due to storage at - 80â . New band ADPr - monomer - cofilin Long - Dimer ADPr - monomer 201 Supplemental Figure 4 Native gel of ADPr - trimer and gelsolin reactions . Protein bands in addition to the major GSFL : 3mr complex band suggests binding of more than one gelsolin molecules to ADPr - trimer through their monomer binding domains . 202 Supplemental Figure 5 Possible modes of binding of gelsolin segments G1 and G4 - 6 to trimer Gelsolin segments G1 and G4 - 6 can bind to actin subunits of a trimer through their actin monomer binding sites in multiple ways . Presumed models of gelsolin segments bound to actin trimer were generated in PyMOL ( PDB : 3G37 ( F - actin ) ; 1EQY ( G1 / actin monomer ) ; 1H1V ( G4 - 6 / actin monomer ) . G1 and G4 - 6 are shown in yellow and yellow orange , respectively . The trimer consists of two subunits from one strand of F - actin ( cyan ) and one subunit of the counterpart strand ( pink ) . The trimer does not present any alteration in inter - subunit interactions that could occur due to crosslinking or presence of a ribosyl group on each subunit . 203 Supplemental Figure 6 Preliminary data from cryo - grid preparation for GS : 3mr complex . C - flat grid ( CF400 - Cu - UL , Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) was glow discharged , 5 ul of sample at 12 . 5 Î¼g / mL was applied to the grid and the grid was flash frozen using Cryoplunge3 ( Gatan Inc , Pleasanton , CA ) . A and B represent uniform ice thickness with some particles indicated with arrows . No particles were observed in C , potentially due to thicker layer of ice . D represents an area of the âbadâ ice showing ethane contamination at the bottom and some crystalline ice ( blackspots and fuzzy areas ) . Cryo - grid preparation and imaging were done in collaboration with the Khursigara lab at Molecular and Cellular Imaging Facility , University of Guelph . The particle density on the grid was low and needs to be optimized for future imaging . Additionally , reproducible production of grids with uniform ice thickness will be pivotal for future work . D C A B 204 Supplemental Figure 7 Still images from videos capturing movement of F - actin over HMM ex taken during IVM assay . A ) Rhodamine - phalloidin - labeled actin filaments bound to HMM ex at 2 mM ATP observed under an epifluorescence microscope ( Quorum Technologies Ltd . , Lewes , U .
