Surgical resection is the only effective therapy for MPNST . The prognosis is very dismal once recurrence or metastasis occurs . Epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a key process of recurrence and metastasis involving reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton and actin - binding proteins ( ABP ) play a non - negligible role . Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor S ( PTPRS ) , a tumor suppressor previously reported in colorectal cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma and head and neck cancer , is thought to mediate cell migration and invasion by downregulation of EMT . However , its role in MPNST remains unknown . In the present study , by using tissue microarray we demonstrated low expression of PTPRS was related to poor prognosis in MPNST . Knockdown of PTPRS in MPNST cell lines increased migration / invasion and EMT processes were induced with increased N - cadherin and decreased E - cadherin , which indicated PTPRS may serve as a tumor suppressor in MPNST . In addition , we tested all EMT related ABP and found proﬁlin 1 was signiﬁcantly elevated in PTPRS downregulated MPNST cell lines . As a member of actin - binding proteins , proﬁlins are regulators of actin polymerization and contribute to cell motility and invasion , which have been reported to be responsible for EMT . Moreover , results showed that downregulation of proﬁlin 1 could restore the EMT processes caused by PTPRS downregulation in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore , high expression of proﬁlin 1 was signiﬁcantly associated with dismal prognosis . These results highlighted PTPRS served as a potential tumor suppressor in the recurrence and metastasis of MPNST via proﬁlin 1 induced EMT processes and it might provide potential targets for future clinical therapeutics .

PTPRS Suppresses MPNST EMT Processes INTRODUCTION Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are aggressive and devastating tumors of peripheral nerve with an incidence of 0 . 001 percent in the general population ( Mowery and Clayburgh , 2019 ) . However , the risk of MPNST development is signiﬁcantly elevated in NF1 patients , particularly in those with plexiform neuroﬁbromas ( Wei et al . , 2020 ) . NF1 associated MPNST consists of over half of total MPNST cases and is the leading cause of death in NF1 patients ( Higham et al . , 2018 ) . Surgical resection with a suﬃcient wide margin is currently the only potential curative management for MPNST patients ( Reilly et al . , 2017 ) . However , many patients lose the chance of surgical resection at the time of diagnosis due to MPNST strong metastasis potential . Moreover , the local recurrence rate remains high after surgical resection and traditional chemo / radio therapies show mild beneﬁts ( Hirbe et al . , 2017 ; Pasquali and Gronchi , 2017 ) . Therefore , investigating underlying mechanisms of MPNST recurrence and metastasis is of great importance to develop future target therapies and improve prognosis . Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor S is a member of distinct family of leukocyte common antigen - related receptor - type phosphatases ( Bunin et al . , 2015 ) . The physiological role of PTPRS has been well - established in the development of nerve system ( Meathrel et al . , 2002 ; Stewart et al . , 2013 ) and pituitary gland ( Wallace et al . , 1999 ) . Recently , studies have revealed vital roles of PTPRS in immune - mediated intestinal inﬂammation ( Murchie et al . , 2014 ) , autophagy and progression of various types of cancers ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . The role and underlying mechanisms of PTPRS in diﬀerent diseases show signiﬁcant heterogeneity ( Du and Grandis , 2015 ) . In hepatocellular carcinoma and head and neck cancer , PTPRS regulated EGFR in EMT processes and drug resistance ( Lui et al . , 2014 ) . Whereas , in colorectal cancer PTPRS regulated RAS pathway activity by inactivating ERK and preventing its nuclear translocation ( Davis et al . , 2018 ) . However , the role of PTPRS in neurogenic tumors remains unclear , especially there is previously no study investigating its role in MPNST . Our present study is the ﬁrst one demonstrating the vital role of PTPRS in MPNST recurrence and metastasis . Epithelial - mesenchymal transition is a fundamental biological process during which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics ( Mittal , 2018 ) . EMT plays a vital role in cancer recurrence and metastasis ( Mittal , 2018 ) . The dramatic changes in phenotypes and biological behaviors involve a reorganization of actin cytoskeleton , which leads to gain of cellular plasticity and enables membrane protrusions for invasive growth ( Yin et al . , Abbreviations : a - SMA , alpha smooth muscle actin ; ABP , actin - binding protein ; ANLN , anillin actin binding protein ; ARP2 , actin related protein 2 ; ARP3 , actin related protein 3 ; CFL1 , coﬁlin 1 ; E - CAD , E - cadherin ; EGFR , epithelial growth factor receptor ; EMT , epithelial - mesenchymal transition ; EPN1 , epsin 1 ; EPN2 , epsin 2 ; EPN3 , epsin 3 ; FLNA , ﬁlamin A ; FLNB , ﬁlamin B ; FLNC , ﬁlamin C ; FSCN1 , fascin actin - bundling protein 1 ; GAPDH , glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ; GSN , gelsolin ; HSC , human Schwann cell ; IHC , immunohistochemistry ; MPNST , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ; N - CAD , N - cadherin ; NC , normal control ; NF1 , neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 ; NNT , normal nerve tissue ; PFN1 , proﬁlin 1 ; PFN2 , proﬁlin 2 ; PTPRS , protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor S ; TAGLN1 , transgelin 1 ; TAGLN2 , transgelin 2 . 2020 ) . It is well established that the organization and dynamics of actin cytoskeleton are controlled by a large array of ABP ( Lappalainen , 2016 ) . However , the key ABP in PTPRS mediated MPNST recurrence and metastasis remains unknown . To explore the clinical impacts of PTPRS and its downstream vital ABP in EMT processes in MPNST recurrence and metastasis , correlation studies of clinicopathological characteristics using tissue microarrays and biological functional assays in vitro and in vivo have been conducted . In addition , all EMT related ABP have been screened and proﬁlin 1 is the potential key ABP in PTPRS mediated EMT processes , which expression signiﬁcantly correlates with dismal prognosis of MPNST patients . Taken together , our study shows PTPRS acts as a metastatic suppressor in MPNST via proﬁlin 1 - induced EMT and PTPRS and proﬁlin 1 might be potential promising biomarkers for target therapy . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines One HSC line and two MPNST cell lines ( sNF02 . 2 , sNF96 . 2 ) were purchased from ATCC ( American Type Culture Collection , ATCC ) . Five MPNST cell lines ( ST88 - 14 , STS26T , T265 , S462 , and S462TY ) were kindly granted by Prof . Vincent Keng ( Li X . X . et al . , 2018 ) and Prof . Jilong Yang ( Du et al . , 2013 ) . All MPNST cell lines were derived from NF1 patients , except STS26T . Cell lines were maintained in DMEM , 10 % FBS and penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco , United States ) and were tested mycoplasma negative every 3 months . Veriﬁcation of cell lines was conﬁrmed by Short Tandem Repeat DNA proﬁling ( Applied Biological Materials Inc . , Canada ) . Patients and Specimens Fresh human MPNST tissues were gained from surgical resection specimens of patients in Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital ( Shanghai , China ) . Human NNTs were obtained from surgical resection residuals of patients in facial nerve repair . The study was approved by Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital , Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , and informed consent was achieved from patients under institutional reviewer board protocols . Paraﬃn - embedded tumor tissues from 49 patients after surgical treatment of MPNST between 2005 and 2018 were used for the construction of tissue microarray and IHC . Tissue microarray scores were independently assessed by two independent researchers . In order to eliminate the error caused by diﬀerent observation conditions , the researcher was asked to ﬁnish the assessment of a total microarray within a continuous time interval about 2 h . The score was determined by the proportion of positive cells so that negative , < 25 % , 25 % ∼ 50 % , > 50 % were , respectively , recorded as 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . Discussion with a third researcher if disagreements occur . Clinical information was collected through review of electronic medical records . 29 of 49 patients’ survival status were accessed and conﬁrmed by telephone follow - up , which data were used for survival analyses .

PTPRS Suppresses MPNST EMT Processes 20 in 49 patients lost follow - up currently and were not be able to be contacted with multiple methods . In vitro Cell Function Experiments Cell proliferation experiments were conducted by using Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK8 , Dojindo , Japan ) . A quantity of 10 3 cells per well were seeded appropriately in 96 - well plates , and CCK8 solution diluted 1 : 10 by serum - free DMEM was added on day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 to measure the 450 nm OD value after 2 h incubation . Every assay was repeated independently for three times . A scratch assay was used to imitate the process of migration of adherent tumor cells . Cells were seeded and grown to nearly conﬂuence in 6 - well plates . Before scratching , cells were starved for at least 12 h by maintaining in 1 % serum DMEM . Each scratch was made along the centerline of wells by using 200 uL pipette tips . After softly wash away the ﬂoated cells , images of scratch at diﬀerent intervals were taken by an inverted microscope . The area inside the scratch was measured using ImageJ . Percentage of wound closure = ( area of scratch on 0 h − area of scratch on 18 h or 24 h ) / area of scratch on 0 h . Transwell assays were performed using hanging cell culture inserts ( 8 µ m pore size ; Millipore , United States ) . A total of 6 × 10 4 cells per well were seeded on top compartment in 200 uL serum - free DMEM and gently placed in 24 - well plates which were added 600 uL 15 % serum DMEM in advance . In case of invasion assays , the top compartments were coated by Matrigel ( BD Biosciences , United States ) diluted 1 : 8 in DMEM . The migrated and invasive cells were stained with 0 . 5 % crystal violet and the upper cells were softly removed with a cotton swab after 8 h incubation for migration and 24 h for invasion . Images of four random views were captured , and the cell numbers were counted using ImageJ . Quantitative PCR Total tissue and cell RNA were extracted according to the procedure of the RNeasy kit ( Qiagen , Canada ) . The cDNA was transformed using PrimeScript RT Master Mix Kit ( Takara , Japan ) . Quantitative PCR was performed on cDNA using SYBR Green System ( Applied Biosystems ) . GAPDH was used as an endogenous control . Relative expression was calculated using the (cid:49)(cid:49) CT , n = 4 . Western Blottings Tissues and cells were lysed in a RIPA buﬀer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Beyotime , China ) . Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA Protein Assay reagent ( Beyotime , China ) . Antibodies used were Proﬁlin 1 ( Abcam , ab124904 ) , PTPRS ( Abnova , H00005802 - M01 ) , E - cadherin ( Abcam , ab1416 ) , N - cadherin ( Abcam , ab76011 ) , Snail ( Abcam , ab53519 ) , Slug ( Abcam , ab51772 ) , a - SMA ( Abcam , ab7817 ) , Vimentin ( Abcam , ab92547 ) , GAPDH ( CST , 2118 ) , β - actin ( CST , 3700 ) . Band signals were detected using an Amersham Imager 600 ( General Electric Company , Boston , MA , United States ) . Knockdown and Overexpression Experiments For lentiviral shRNA infection , MPNST cells at 70 % conﬂuence were infected with lentiviral particles containing shRNAs targeting PTPRS ( target : shA , CCTATTACGTCATCGAATATA ; shB , CCAGAGCTATTTCATTGTGAT ; shC , GGCTGAAGCTGGATAAGAA ) and proﬁlin 1 ( target : shA , GCTCCAAGATCTCTAATGTAC ; shB , GACCAGTATTGTGTTCCTTGT ; shC , GAAGTTGCTGAACTGCATTAC ) at a MOI of 10 . A random nonsense targeted sequence was used as NC . These were purchased from Hanyin Biotechnology ( Shanghai , China ) . Cells were infected overnight and stable cell populations were selected with puromycin ( 2 µ g / mL ) 48 h later . For overexpression plasmid transfection , cells were precultured by antibiotic - free DMEM overnight and replaced with fresh complete medium at 6 h after PTPRS plasmids ( purchased from ORIGENE , cat # RC221440 ) infection . An empty pcDNA was used as NC . Transfected cells were validated using qPCR and western blottings . Histological Staining Tissue sections from patients and mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin . For IHC , sections were dewaxed in xylene , rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol . After quick wash , antigens were unmasked and retrieval by microwave in citrate buﬀer . The primary antibody was applied for overnight incubation at 4 ◦ C . After incubation with appropriate biotin - conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at routine time , the signal was detected with DAB substrate ( Vector Laboratories ) . Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin . Antibodies used were proﬁlin 1 ( Abcam , ab124904 ) , PTPRS ( Abcam , ab222798 ) . Xenograft Tumor and Lung Metastatic Mice Models 16 and 32 male NOD - SCID IL - 2 receptor gamma null ( Payne et al . , 2019 ) mice ( purchased from Shanghai Model Organisms , China ) were used , respectively , for xenograft tumor models and lung metastatic models . For the xenograft models , a total of 5 × 10 6 cells in 100 uL PBS containing 50 % Matrigel ( BD Biosciences , United States ) were injected subcutaneously into the armpit of each mouse . For the lung metastatic mice models , cells were resuspended in 200 uL PBS and then injected via tail vain with 4 × 10 6 cells per injection . Tumors in this study were allowed to grow in a donor mouse to a maximum volume of approximately 1 , 000 mm 3 . Size of tumors and weights of mice were measured twice a week . Tumor volume was calculated as follows : L × W 2 / 2 , where L is the length and W is the width . The number of metastatic nodules were calculated by hematoxylin and eosin stained after preparing sections of lung tissues every 50 um . The xenograft models were sacriﬁced after 7 weeks and the lung metastatic models were sacriﬁced after 2 weeks . All procedures were performed in accord with the guidelines established by the Shanghai Medical Experimental Animal Care Commission .

PTPRS Suppresses MPNST EMT Processes Statistical Analysis The count of cells and quantitation of western bands were analyzed using ImageJ software . Analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 23 and GraphPad Prism version 8 . 0 . Univariate Kaplan Meier analyses used a Gehan – Breslow – Wilcox log - rank test . Clinicopathological correlation were analyzed by Spearman correlation . In vivo and vitro data were shown as mean ± SD and were analyzed by paired or unpaired t - test , two - sided . Linear regression was conducted in GraphPad Prism . p - value < 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant . RESULTS PTPRS Is Signiﬁcantly Downregulated in MPNST To explore the expression of PTPRS in MPNST , IHC stainings of PTPRS in a MPNST cohort including 49 patients were performed . Representative PTPRS IHC stainings of MPNST and normal nerve were shown in Figure 1A . High expression of PTPRS in normal nerve was detected , however , 67 . 5 % MPNST patients showed low or medium PTPRS expression . Consistent with IHC results , western blottings showed signiﬁcantly high expression of PTPRS in normal nerve compared to MPNST tissue specimens ( Figure 1B ) . Low Expression of PTPRS Correlates With Disease Progression and Dismal Prognosis By classifying MPNST patients into PTPRS high ( 2 – 3 scores ) and low ( 0 – 1 scores ) expression group , clinicopathological correlation analyses were performed . The ratio of PTPRS low expression was signiﬁcantly high in MPNST patients younger than 45 years old ( Table 1 ) . Mowery and Clayburgh ( 2019 ) demonstrated previously young age below 40 years old signiﬁcantly correlated with short survival compared to patients with age over 40 years . Survival analyses showed that PTPRS FIGURE 1 | Downregulation of PTPRS correlated with poor prognosis in MPNST patients .

Among all dead MPNST patients during follow - up period , the proportion of PTPRS positive cells in IHC stainings was determined using ImageJ . Positive linear regression correlation was detected between length of post - operational survival and proportion of PTPRS positive cells in MPNST ( p = 0 . 0003 , Figure 1D ) . PTPRS Downregulation Prompts MPNST Migration / Invasion via EMT in vitro and in vivo Seven MPNST cell lines and one normal Schwann cell line were screened for PTPRS expression by using qPCR and western blottings ( Figure 2A ) . S462 and S462TY were selected as high - PTPRS - expression cell lines . PTPRS down - regulated lentivirus was established as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) and eﬀectiveness was conﬁrmed in S462 and S462TY cell lines ( Figure 2B ) . In vitro experiments were carried out by the stable strain constructed by shA , shB , and shC . In vivo experiments were carried out by PTPRS shC ( which is the most eﬀective lentivirus and referred to shPTPRS in the following manuscript ) . No diﬀerence was detected in proliferation of PTPRS downregulated MPNST cells and control cells ( Figure 2C ) . PTPRS downregulation signiﬁcantly increased migration and invasion capabilities of S462 and S462TY cells ( Figure 2D ) . Subcutaneous MPNST tumor models revealed similar results in vivo . There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in tumor growth and mice body weight ( Supplementary Figure S1C ) . However , PTPRS downregulation signiﬁcantly increased number and size of metastasis nodes ( Figure 2F ) . PTPRS downregulation increased expression of N - cadherin and alpha smooth muscle action ( α SMA ) as well as decreased expression of E - cadherin ( Figure 2E ) . Immunoﬂuorescence stainings of E - cadherin and vimentin showed similar results ( Supplementary Figure S1D ) . Downstream EMT transcriptional factors , including Snail and Slug , were also activated ( Figure 2E ) . All these ﬁndings indicated EMT was enhanced by downregulation of PTPRS . PTPRS Overexpression Suppresses MPNST Migration / Invasion via EMT in vitro MPNST ST88 - 14 and T265 were selected as PTPRS low expression cell lines for investigations ( Figure 3A ) . As the length of PTPRS coding sequence exceeded in the capacity of lentivirus as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) , PTPRS overexpression was realized using plasmid transfections in ST88 - 14 and T265 cells , which has relatively short eﬀective duration . Therefore , only in vitro experiments were performed . PTPRS overexpression had no impacts on MPNST cell proliferation ( Figure 3B ) . Overexpression of PTPRS signiﬁcantly suppressed the ability of migration and invasion of MPNST cells ( Figure 3C ) . Consistent with previous results , EMT was suppressed in PTPRS overexpressed MPNST cells . E - cadherin was elevated and N - cadherin / α SMA were downregulated ( Figure 3D ) . Expressions of downstream EMT transcriptional factors , Snail and Slug , were signiﬁcantly decreased . Screening of EMT Related ABP in PTPRS Downregulated MPNST Cells Epithelial - mesenchymal transition involved organization and dynamics of actin cytoskeleton controlled by a large array of ABP . Through literature review , 16 ABP were previously demonstrated to be involved in mediating EMT processes ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . All these ABP were screened using qPCR in PTPRS downregulated S462 and S462TY cells with corresponding control cells . Proﬁlin 1 was demonstrated to be the most signiﬁcantly elevated ABP in both PTPRS downregulated MPNST cells and the trend is consistent in both cell lines ( Figure 4A ) . While proﬁlin 2 , an important member of proﬁlin family , was upregulated in one strain by qPCR , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in its protein expression in both knockdown and overexpression cell lines ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) . The Role of Proﬁlin 1 in PTPRS Mediated EMT Processes To investigate the role of proﬁlin 1 in PTPRS mediated EMT processes , proﬁlin 1 downregulated lentivirus was established and MPNST S462 and S462TY cells with both PTPRS and proﬁlin 1 downregulation were established and validated ( Figure 4B , Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Due to the best eﬀectiveness in PFN1 downregulation , shA ( referred to shPFN1 in the following manuscript ) was chosen to be applied on S462 and S462TY shPTPRS cell lines . No proliferation diﬀerences were detected in PTPRS / proﬁlin 1 downregulated MPNST cells and PTPRS only downregulated MPNST cells ( Figure 4C ) .

PTPRS Suppresses MPNST EMT Processes expression correlation was also found in lung metastasis nodes ( Figure 4F ) . High Expression of Proﬁlin 1 Negatively Correlated With Prognosis of MPNST Patients The expression of proﬁlin 1 was evaluated in MPNST tissue array and NNT ( Figure 5A ) . Representative ﬁgures were shown ( Figure 5A ) . Unlike high PTPRS expression , NNTs showed negative expression of proﬁlin 1 . By classifying MPNST patients based on proﬁlin 1 expression ( high , 2 – 3 scores ; low , 0 – 1 scores ) , clinicopathological correlation analyses revealed proﬁlin 1 expression negatively correlated with large tumor size ( p = 0 . 047 , Table 2 ) . The representative immunostaining images of proﬁlin 1 and PTPRS in the same patients were shown in Figure 5B . The overall survival of high proﬁlin 1 expression MPNST patients signiﬁcantly shortened compared with low proﬁlin 1 expression MPNST patients ( p = 0 . 0445 , Figure 5C and Table 2 ) .

Negative linear regression correlation was detected between length of post - operational survival and level of proﬁlin 1 expression in MPNST patients ( p = 0 . 025 , Figure 5E ) . DISCUSSION Due to local recurrence and early metastasis , the prognosis of MPNST is dismal ( Widemann and Italiano , 2018 ) . Even with aggressive surgical resection and combined therapies with chemotherapy and radiotherapy , the improvements for outcomes of MPNST patients remain limited ( Kroep et al . , 2011 ; Miao et al . , 2019 ) . Therefore , investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying MPNST recurrence and metastasis is urgently needed . In the present study , we demonstrate that PTPRS is frequently downregulated in MPNST and downregulation of PTPRS signiﬁcantly increases immigration and invasion by prompting EMT processes via increasing the expression of proﬁlin 1 . In addition , downregulation of proﬁlin 1 could substantially restore the impacts of PTPRS on EMT processes . Clinicopathological correlation analyses reveal that low expression of PTPRS and high expression of proﬁlin 1 signiﬁcantly are associated with disease progression . Survival analyses show PTPRS and proﬁlin 1 could be used as predictors for prognosis with high PTPRS and low proﬁlin 1 indicating the best outcome . Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor S was previously demonstrated to play an important role in neural developments and immune responses as well as function as tumor suppressor gene in various types of cancers ( Du and Grandis , 2015 ) . Our research team previously identiﬁed PTPRS regulated EMT via dephosphorylation of EGFR in hepatocellular carcinoma ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . PTPRS – EGFR interactions also played a vital role in chemotherapy resistance in head and neck cancer ( Geiger et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , STAT3 was another downstream target of PTPRS in cancer progression ( Geiger et al . , 2016 ) . Although it was well established that ABP had signiﬁcant impacts on cytoskeleton organization during EMT processes ( Kristo et al . , 2016 ; Yin et al . , 2019 ) . No potential downstream ABP has been previously screened and identiﬁed . Through comprehensively screening all EMT related ABP , proﬁlin 1 was identiﬁed . Proﬁlin 1 is a member of proﬁlin family of small ABP , which ubiquitously expressed in various types of cells ( Rodriguez Del Rio et al . , 2018 ) . Proﬁlin 1 played an important role in regulation of actin polymerization and cytoskeleton remodeling ( Stritt et al . , 2018 ) . Serum proﬁlin 1 was independently associated with endothelial dysfunction , cardiovascular events and survival in patients with chronic kidney disease ( Eroglu et al . , 2017 ; Li X . et al . , 2018 ) . Mutations in proﬁlin 1 led to familiar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Daigle et al . , 2013 ) . The role of proﬁlin 1 in cancer development and progression has been investigated while heterogeneity still exists . In colorectal cancer and breast cancer , high proﬁlin 1 expression was associated with lower stage and longer survival ( Huang et al . , 2020 ) . The underlying mechanisms of oncogenic eﬀects of proﬁlin 1 were downstream SMAD3 upregulation and S137 phosphorylation ( Tang et al . , 2015 ) . However , overexpression of proﬁlin 1 was observed in renal cell carcinoma and gastric cancer ( Cheng et al . , 2015 ; Karamchandani et al . , 2015 ) . The underlying mechanisms of tumor suppressor eﬀects of proﬁlin 1 were integrin β 1 / FAK ( Cheng et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , the eﬀects and corresponding underlying mechanisms of proﬁlin 1 demonstrated a cancer - dependent manner , which needed to be explored in MPNST . As local recurrence and metastasis remain the most urgent and challenging obstacles in MPNST treatments and EMT is the key process , our present study elucidates the impacts and underlying mechanisms of PTPRS on EMT from the aspects of proﬁlin 1 . These ﬁndings add our knowledge about MPNST deﬁning the interaction between PTPRS and proﬁlin 1 in EMT processes . PTPRS and proﬁlin 1 could serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for drug development for MPNST patients .
