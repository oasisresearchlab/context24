The extracellular matrix’s ( ECM ) response to mechanical force , described mathematically as the elastic modulus , is believed to play a particularly critical role in regulatory and pathological cell behaviors . The basement membrane ( BM ) is a specialization of the ECM that serves as the immediate interface for many cell types ( e . g . all epithelial cells ) and through which cells are connected to the underlying stroma . Matrigel is a commercially available BM - like com - plex and serves as an easily accessible experimental simulant of native BMs . However , the local elastic modulus of Matrigel has not been deﬁned under physiological conditions . Here we present the proce - dures and results of indentation tests performed on Matrigel with atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) in an aqueous , temperature controlled environment . The average modulus value was found to be approxi - mately 450 Pa . However , this result is considerably higher than macroscopic shear storage moduli reported in the scientiﬁc literature . The reason for this discrepancy is believed to result from differences in test methods and the tendency of Matrigel to soften at temperatures below 37 (cid:2) C . (cid:3) 2009 Elsevier Inc .

Cellular responses to chemical stimuli have been studied for many years , but a number of recent reports suggest that biophysical cues such as substrate topography ( Flemming et al . , 1999 ; Karuri et al . , 2004 ; Teixeira et al . , 2006 ) and compliance ( Discher et al . , 2005 ; Flanagan et al . , 2002 ; Pelham and Wang , 1997 ) play an important role in both nor - mal and pathological behaviors . Stem cell lineage speciﬁcation ( Engler et al . , 2006 ) , malignant behavior in mammary gland epithe - lia ( Paszek et al . , 2005 ) , and fundamental cell behaviors such as migration ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Wong et al . , 2003 ) , prolifera - tion ( McDaniel et al . , 2007 ; Thompson et al . , 2005 ) , and differenti - ation ( Boontheekul et al . , 2007 ; Peyton et al . , 2006 ) have been shown to be affected by substrate compliance . These studies collec - tively imply that extracellular matrix ( ECM ) compliance acts as a homeostatic regulator of normal tissue function . This ﬁnding di - rectly applies to the biocompatibility of implantable prosthetic de - vices , the efﬁcacy of tissue engineering processes , and the relevance of cell culture studies . Therefore , it has become apparent that mechanical characterization of the cellular microenvironment , both in its natural state and in the laboratory , is increasingly neces - sary to develop a more complete description of biological systems . Within the context of environmental cueing of cell behavior , a specialized layer of ECM known as the basement membrane ( BM ) is of particular interest . The BM is a protein complex consist - ing mainly of collagens , laminins , nidogen / entactin , and perlecan ( LeBleu et al . , 2007 ) . It is in direct contact with the basal layer of epithelial and vascular endothelial cells and is a ubiquitous struc - ture found in a wide range of tissues across all vertebrate species . However , experimentation with BMs is complicated by the relative difﬁculty and expense associated with obtaining and isolating in - tact , native samples in a laboratory setting . Additionally , the use of primarily isolated basement membranes from native tissues introduces the intrinsic individual variability associated with ge - netic differences , age and health of the individual organism . Matrigel ( Kleinman and Martin , 2005 ) , a reconstituted BM - like complex harvested from Engelbreth – Holm – Swarm mouse tumor cultures , is a commercially available simulant of native BMs . It has found widespread use as a model system for the study of tu - mor cell invasion ( Zaman et al . , 2006 ) , hepatocyte aggregation ( Semler et al . , 2000 ) , stem cell differentiation ( Ma et al . , 2008 ) , and the formation of tube - like structures by vascular endothelial cells ( Kobayashi et al . , 2004 ) . Matrigel is relatively versatile and can be molded into thick gels , used to coat cell culture substrates with ECM proteins , or geometrically patterned using soft lithogra - phy techniques ( Sodunke et al . , 2007 ) . The nanoscale topographic features of Matrigel have been shown to be similar to those of sev - eral native BMs ( Abrams et al . , 2000 ) , but the appropriateness of its use as a mechanical surrogate has not been established .

AFM has been widely used as a mechanical testing device for soft , hydrated materials because it allows small forces to be applied over short distances in an aque - ous environment ( Domke and Radmacher , 1998 ) . Therefore , the elastic modulus reported herein is highly relevant because it more closely mimics the conditions experienced by living cells in vivo . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Matrigel sample preparation Three different lots of Matrigel ( Catalog number 354234 , BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) were tested and prepared according to the manufacturer . Samples for AFM indentation tests were cre - ated by cold - pipetting Matrigel into wells mounted on AFM spec - imen discs ( Fig . 1 ) . Specimens were made approximately 1 mm thick in order to avoid substrate effects during indentation ( Domke and Radmacher , 1998 ) . The Matrigel was polymerized for 30 min in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 (cid:2) C , and then placed in 1 (cid:2) phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS – pH 7 . 4 ) at 37 (cid:2) C for 24 h to allow com - plete gelation . Sample temperatures were not allowed to drop below 37 (cid:2) C before or during experimentation . In order to accom - plish this , an AFM environmental chamber was built to maintain a constant temperature of 37 (cid:2) C . The chamber consists of a commer - cially available thermoelectric heater / cooler ( Igloo Products Corp . , Katy , TX ) modiﬁed with a digital temperature controller . All AFM parts , including probe and ﬂuid cell , were preheated in the envi - ronmental chamber for at least 30 min prior to use , and all tests were conducted in PBS preheated to approximately 45 (cid:2) C to ensure that the system did not drop below 37 (cid:2) C over the course of exper - imentation . Throughout the experiment the AFM remained inside the environmental chamber and the temperature was maintained at 37 (cid:2) C . 2 . 2 . AFM indentation testing A Multimode AFM with Nanoscope IIIa controller ( Veeco Instru - ments Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA , USA ) was used for all indentation tests , as described elsewhere ( Dimitriadis et al . , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , the elastic ( Young’s ) modulus was extracted from a plot of cantile - ver deﬂection versus sample ( piezo ) displacement by ﬁtting the data to a spherical Hertzian contact equation ( Sneddon , 1965 ) , ð z (cid:3) z 0 Þ ¼ ð d (cid:3) d 0 Þ þ 0 : 75 k d (cid:3) d 0 ð Þ 1 (cid:3) t 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) E ﬃﬃﬃ R p (cid:5) (cid:6) 23 ð 1 Þ where z and d are piezo and deﬂection coordinates , respectively , z 0 and d 0 are piezo and deﬂection contact coordinates , respectively , k is the cantilever spring constant , t is Poisson’s ratio ( assumed to be 0 . 5 for a soft , incompressible material ( Boudou et al . , 2006 ) ) , E is the elastic modulus , and R is the particle probe radius ( 500 nm ) . E and z 0 were used as ﬁtting parameters over the ﬁrst 400 – 500 nm of deﬂection – displacement data . Spherically tipped cantilevers ( 1 l m diameter ) with nominal spring constants of 0 . 06 N / m were used in all experiments . Canti - lever spring constants were more precisely calibrated by the man - ufacturer with the Sader method ( Sader et al . , 2005 ) prior to use . Indentations were performed at a rate of 2 – 6 l m / s to probe elastic rather than viscoelastic behavior ( Mahaffy et al . , 2000 ) , and only the piezo extension data were analyzed to avoid artifacts created by tip adhesion and uncertainty in the contact coordinates . The average maximum force applied to each sample was 3 nN . The moduli of at least four samples of each lot were calculated as an average over 3 – 10 sites per sample . 3 . Results AFM was used to obtain deﬂection – displacement curves on Matrigel at physiological temperatures in an aqueous environment ( Fig . 2 ) . Micron sized spherical tips were used because they provide a contact area which is larger than that of conical or pyramidal tips . A larger contact area is desirable because interactions between probe geometry and the nanoscale topography of the sample sur - face are reduced , and the contact area of a cellular focal adhesions is more closely approximated ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ) . These factors provide a more biologically relevant measurement . Deﬂection – displacement proﬁles obtained on Matrigel are typ - ical of soft materials , with piezo displacements an order of magni - tude larger than resultant cantilever deﬂections . Results from all samples are summarized in Table 1 . The mean elastic modulus for each lot of Matrigel was similar . Lot 1 exhibited an average elastic modulus of 420 ± 280 Pa , while the average elastic modulus of lot 2 was 400 ± 175 Pa . Lot 3 exhibited some variations in mod - ulus within each sample . The majority of the data obtained were consistent with those obtained with each of the other tested lots , with an average modulus of 480 ± 240 Pa . On these samples , how - ever , areas of higher elastic modulus were observed , with modulus values ranging from 1 to 3 kPa . The average modulus value ob - tained on lot 3 increased to 840 ± 870 Pa when including all data points . The overall average , including all three lots , was 443 ± 285 Pa for the elastic modulus of Matrigel ( Table 1 ) . Variations in sample moduli are believed to be a result of slight temperature variations among samples and microscale heterogeneities within the mate - rial . However , these factors had a marginal impact on calculated moduli , and our method was observed to provide a high degree of reproducibility . 4 . Discussion Force curves obtained on Matrigel typically exhibited evidence of a small amount of viscoelasticity , with a separation between the approach and retract curves . The viscoelasticity was minimized by choice of a slow indentation rate and was not changed by fur - ther decreasing the rate . The approach curve , however , showed a good ﬁt with the Hertz equation and the viscoelasticity was there - fore assumed to have a minimal effect on the resulting modulus values . In addition , adhesion of the tip to the sample was occasion - Fig . 1 . Proﬁle view of the specimen holder . Matrigel was cold pipetted and polymerized directly in a well created by attaching a nylon washer to a plastic coverslip mounted on an AFM specimen disc . Samples were approximately 1 mm in thickness to avoid substrate effects during indentation . To prevent softening of the sample , temperatures were not allowed to drop below 37 (cid:2) C during testing . S . S . Sooﬁ et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 167 ( 2009 ) 216 – 219 217 ally observed . The adhesion may effect modulus measurements , but no difference in modulus was observed between those force curves with and without adhesion , indicating that it is valid to ana - lyze these curves with the Hertz equation . Although different lots of Matrigel can have varying composi - tions of biopolymers and protein growth factors , it was unclear if each lot would exhibit identical mechanical properties . Measure - ments from three separate lots have yielded very similar elastic moduli , with average values of 420 , 400 and 480 Pa , indicating that the mechanical properties are not directly inﬂuenced by small changes in Matrigel composition . However , one lot did contain re - gions of higher elastic moduli . The origin of these areas is unclear , but has been previously attributed to granular regions within the ﬁlm ( Reed et al . , 2009 ) . Previous studies report shear storage modulus values of approx - imately 55 ( Zaman et al . , 2006 ) and 34 Pa ( Semler et al . , 2000 ) for Matrigel . Approximating the material as ideally elastic ( vanishing shear loss modulus ) , these elastic moduli are lower than those ob - tained in our experiments . The above - cited studies employed bulk rheometry , a dynamic mechanical testing technique by which vis - coelastic material properties are determined by exposing the spec - imen to oscillatory shear strains . Discrepancies between rheological and AFM measurements may be due to several factors including length scale differences in test methods , different stress modes ( shear versus compression ) , and temperature conditions . AFM indentation probes highly localized surface properties of a material , and local material properties may differ from those ob - served with macroscopic test methods . Shear versus compressive forces elicit different modes of mechanical response and may pro - duce anisotropic effects . One report of the elastic modulus of Matrigel with AFM , taken at room temperature , gives a value of 120 Pa , still lower than reported here for samples maintained at 37 (cid:2) C ( Alcaraz et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , the most likely explanation for the observed discrepancy is specimen temperature . As observed in our experiments , allowing the specimen temperature to drop below 37 (cid:2) C before or during experimentation resulted in a de - crease in sample stiffness . Loss of sample gelation leads to strong probe - surface attraction and adhesion , which made the contact point indiscernible in the deﬂection – displacement data . Such indiscriminate surface / probe interactions are indicative of a semi - ﬂuid sample surface and rendered indentation tests inconclu - sive . Therefore , we expect mechanical testing of Matrigel without strict temperature control to result in an underestimate of the elas - tic modulus . Recently , the elastic modulus of Matrigel has been re - ported after a gelation time of 1 h to be similar to those reported here , with a median of 650 Pa ( Reed et al . , 2009 ) , using mechanical interferometry . While it was unclear if the sample temperature was maintained at 37 (cid:2) C , it was stated that the sample chamber was sealed to prevent evaporation . AFM indentation tests provide experimental conditions that more closely mimic both the length scale and environmental con - ditions experienced by cells in vivo . The use of micron scale probe geometries , piconewton indentation forces , and aqueous environ - ments at physiological temperatures suggest that AFM is an appro - priate instrument for the mechanical characterization of biological materials . The elastic modulus of Matrigel reported in this study is approximately an order of magnitude lower than determined for cross - linked polyacrylamide gels both prepared in our group and reported ( Engler et al . , 2004 ) and poly electrolyte multilayer ﬁlms ( Schneider et al . , 2006 ) . These hydrated gels have been used exten - sively as cell culture substrates because they have tunable mechanical properties , can be cast as thin ﬁlms , and show a high degree of biological compatibility . This modulus difference may have direct relevance when choosing an appropriate support for the study of cell behaviors . The values obtained are also lower than measurements obtained for native corneal basement membranes ( Last et al . , 2009 ) . 5 .

However , detailed attention to experi - mental conditions is necessary for reliable and consistent results . In particular , the delicate temperature sensitivity of Matrigel de - mands that test samples are kept above 37 (cid:2) C in order to prevent a decrease in sample stiffness . Discrepancies between results re - ported here and in the literature are believed to be a consequence of different test methods and the tendency of Matrigel to soften at room temperature .
