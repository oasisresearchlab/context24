Scott , 1 , 2 R . Dyche Mullins , 1 Wendell A . Lim 1 , 2 * The protein N - WASP [ a homolog to the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) ] regulates actin polymerization by stimulating the actin - nucleating activity of the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex . N - WASP is tightly regulated by multiple signals : Only costimulation by Cdc42 and phosphatidyl - inositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) yields potent polymerization . We found that regulation requires N - WASP(cid:213)s constitutively active output domain ( VCA ) and two regulatory domains : a Cdc42 - binding domain and a previously undescribed PIP 2 - binding domain . In the absence of stimuli , the regulatory modules together hold the VCA - Arp2 / 3 complex in an inactive (cid:210)closed(cid:211) conformation . In this state , both the Cdc42 - and PIP 2 - binding sites are masked . Binding of either input destabilizes the closed state and enhances binding of the other input . This cooperative activation mechanism shows how combinations of simple binding domains can be used to integrate and amplify coincident signals . Many cellular processes are controlled by networks of interacting signaling pathways ( 1 , 2 ) . For example , during directed cell mo - tility , multiple pathways converge to precise - ly target actin polymerization to the cell’s leading edge . Little is known , however , about the molecular mechanisms by which the rel - evant signaling proteins integrate these mul - tiple inputs to yield a coordinated response .

N - WASP interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex and activates its ability to nucleate actin filaments ( 5 , 6 ) . Activation only occurs , however , when N - WASP is stimulated by the proper set of upstream signals . The two best characterized inputs are the rho family guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , both of which are regulated by up - stream pathways critical for motility ( 1 , 7 , 8 ) . Individually , Cdc42 and PIP 2 are weak acti - vators of N - WASP . Together , however , the inputs act synergistically : costimulation with low concentrations of both yields potent ac - tivation ( 5 ) . Thus , N - WASP acts as a signal integration device that can precisely target actin polymerization to sites on the mem - brane at which both PIP 2 and activated Cdc42 are present . Several domains within N - WASP have been implicated in this signal processing be - havior ( Fig . 1A ) . Output is controlled by a COOH - terminal domain that directly inter - acts with and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 5 ) . This domain is referred to as the VCA domain ( also called WWA ) because it has a verprolin homology motif ( V ) , a cofilin ho - mology motif ( C ) , and an acidic motif ( A ) . The acidic motif binds Arp2 / 3 , whereas the verprolin motif binds actin monomers , prob - ably delivering them to Arp2 / 3 ( 5 , 6 ) . The isolated VCA domain is constitutively active ; however , this activity is suppressed in full - length N - WASP , indicating that NH 2 - termi - nal regions play a regulatory role ( 5 ) . One key regulatory domain is the GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) , which forms an intramolec - ular interaction with the cofilin homology motif ( Fig . 1A ) ( 9 , 10 ) . Because activated Cdc42 can disrupt the intramolecular interac - tion by binding the GBD , a simple model for N - WASP regulation has been proposed : the intramolecular interaction between the GBD and the cofilin motif blocks binding of Arp2 / 3 to the VCA domain , and Cdc42 re - lieves this autoinhibitory interaction ( 3 , 5 , 9 ) . There are several problems with this model . First , the GBD has never experimentally been shown to block Arp2 / 3 binding or to suffice as a functional repressor of the VCA domain . Second , this simple autoinhibition model fails to explain how PIP 2 is detected as an input , and how its effects are synergistically integrated with those of Cdc42 . To elucidate the mechanism of N - WASP regulation and signal integration , we identified the minimal domains required to repress the VCA domain , mapped their interactions , and determined how they communicate . We found that two adjacent regulatory domains , the GBD and a novel PIP 2 - binding motif , are necessary and sufficient for proper repression and regula - tion of N - WASP . In the absence of stimuli , the two regulatory motifs together lock the VCA - Arp2 / 3 complex in an inactive “closed” confor - mation . The mechanism of repression allows for highly cooperative activation : Cdc42 and PIP 2 disrupt the closed state in a thermodynam - ically coupled fashion , providing the basis for potent signal integration by N - WASP . VCA domain activity was potently re - pressed ( inhibition constant K i 5 ; 1 m M ) by a minimal fragment containing both the GBD and an adjacent , highly basic motif in an in vitro actin polymerization assay ( Fig . 1B ) . We refer to this composite domain as the “control re - gion . ” The basic motif is only ; 20 residues in length and contains nine lysine residues ( 11 ) . In contrast , a second fragment consisting solely of the GBD , although able to interact strongly with the VCA domain , had virtually no inhibi - tory effect ( Fig . 1B ) , even at concentrations ( 100 m M ) well above saturation ( 12 ) . The GBD failed to inhibit even when covalently tethered ( cis ) to the VCA domain ( 13 ) . A third fragment that contains the basic motif and only half of the GBD was also unable to repress ( Fig . 1B ) . These data show that current models for auto - inhibition are incorrect : although required , the GBD alone is insufficient to repress VCA acti - vation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ; rather , the com - posite control region is the minimal repressive element . Remarkably a “mini – N - WASP” that con - tains only the control region and the VCA domain attached by a nine - residue linker is also sufficient to recapitulate the hallmark regulato - ry behavior of N - WASP . Its Arp2 / 3 stimulatory activity is highly repressed but can be synergis - tically activated by costimulation with PIP 2 and Cdc42 complexed with guanosine 5 9 - O - ( 3 9 - thiotriphosphate ) ( Cdc42 z GTP g S ) ( Fig . 1C ) ( 14 ) . Contrary to previous models , we found that neither the control region nor GBD blocks binding of Arp2 / 3 to the VCA domain ( Fig . 2A ) ( 15 ) . Instead , the basic motif par - ticipates in two previously uncharacterized interactions critical for regulation ( Fig . 2 , B through D ) . First , the basic motif is an essen - tial part of a novel Arp2 / 3 binding site ( Fig . 2B ) . Although this Arp2 / 3 interaction region appears to be crucial for repression , it is not sufficient , because a fragment that binds Arp2 / 3 but lacks the intact GBD ( residues 178 through 244 ) also fails to inhibit VCA activity ( Fig . 1B ) . Arp2 / 3 therefore interacts with two sites within N - WASP : the acidic motif within the VCA domain and the basic motif within the control region . Second , we found that the basic region is also a novel 1 Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology , and 2 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics , University of California , San Francisco , CA 94143— 0450 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

This 20 - residue motif is distinct from larger canonical phos - pholipid - binding domains , such as pleckstrin homology ( 16 ) or FYVE finger domains ( 17 ) . The interactions of the control region ( Fig . 2D ) and the requirements for repression ( Fig . 1B ) support a concerted repression model . Neither the GBD nor the basic motif is intrinsically repressive ; rather , each alone is a neutral anchor point that , only when topologically linked to and acting in concert with the other , locks the N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex in an inactive “closed” state ( Fig . 2D ) . These interactions may alter the confor - mation of Arp2 / 3 and / or its relationship with the VCA domain , rendering it inactive . This model is supported by the finding that when the GBD and basic modules are added togeth - er , but as covalently distinct elements , they fail to repress VCA domain activity ( 13 ) . Moreover , these control region subfragments are found to activate mini – N - WASP ( Fig . 2E ) , behavior incompatible with subfrag - ments that are intrinsically repressive ( these would repress or be neutral ) . The behavior is best explained as uncoupling of concerted interactions required for repression ( Fig . 2E ) . The novel mechanism of N - WASP repres - sion suggests a reciprocal mechanism for ac - tivation by both Cdc42 and PIP 2 . These in - puts bind the GBD and basic motifs , respec - tively , and thus either could disrupt the “closed” state and release the active VCA - Arp2 / 3 complex . Activated Cdc42 is known to disrupt the intramolecular GBD - VCA in - teraction ( 9 , 10 ) . We find that Cdc42 also disrupts the control region - Arp2 / 3 interaction ( Fig . 3A ) . However , this alone cannot explain synergistic activation by PIP 2 and Cdc42 . Synergistic activation could be explained , however , if PIP 2 and Cdc42 act cooperatively to disrupt the closed state . Therefore , we tested if binding of the two inputs is thermo - dynamically coupled . Vesicle - binding studies show that PIP 2 and Cdc42 can bind the con - trol region simultaneously ( Fig . 3B ) , and that in the context of mini – N - WASP , Cdc42 can dramatically enhance PIP 2 binding ( Fig . 3C ) . Moreover , parallel fluorescence binding stud - ies show that PIP 2 can enhance Cdc42 bind - ing to the control region , in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 3D ) . Thus , cooperative binding of PIP 2 and Cdc42 to N - WASP has been observed . However , this observed cooperativity dis - cussed above cannot result from direct interac - tion between Cdc42 and PIP 2 , because the two inputs do not bind cooperatively to the isolated control region ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . Instead , coop - erativity must result from coordinated compe - tition with other control region ( B - GBD ) li - gands . For example , interaction of the control region with the VCA domain , present in mini – N - WASP , appears to mask both the PIP 2 - and Fig . 2 . Repression of the N - WASP—Arp2 / 3 complex requires a network of concerted interactions . ( A ) Arp2 / 3 binding to the VCA domain is not blocked by the GBD ( residues 196—274 ) or control region ( 178—274 ) . Arp2 / 3 ( 1 m m ) can bind to VCA ( 10 m m ) precomplexed with a GST - GBD fusion ( 27 ) . Arp2 / 3 can also bind GST—mini - N - WASP , which contains the full control region and is repressed .

S indicates supernatant ( unbound ) and P indicates pellet ( bound ) . Control region ( residues 178—274 ) can selectively bind PIP 2 whereas the GBD alone ( residues 196—274 ) cannot .

Solid lines are essential regions ; dotted lines are important but nonessential regions . Also shown is a cartoon of the repressed , (cid:210)closed(cid:211) state of the N - WASP—Arp2 / 3 complex ( 31 ) . The interactions in the closed state could repress by inducing a conformational change in Arp2 / 3 and / or the VCA domain , or a change in the arrangement of the two components . Disruption of these interactions allows conversion to the active , (cid:210)open(cid:211) state . ( E ) Arti(cid:222)cial disruption of the repressive network leads to activation . Control region subfragments consisting of either the GBD alone , or the basic motif with a truncated GBD ( 1 B - G ) , activate mini—N - WASP . Actin polymerization assays were performed with 80 nM mini—N - WASP 6 10 m M of either subfragment . The postulated mechanism of arti(cid:222)cial activation is shown . R E P O R T S www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 290 27 OCTOBER 2000 803 Cdc42 - binding sites ( Fig . 3C ) . Thus , Cdc42 strongly enhances PIP 2 binding in this context . Arp2 / 3 binding to the control region also ap - pears to mask both the Cdc42 - and PIP 2 - bind - ing sites , explaining the cooperative effects of the two inputs in this context ( Fig . 3D ) . In summary , it is the structure and interactions within the closed state that makes binding of the two inputs highly cooperative . Fig . 3 . Cdc42 and PIP 2 bind cooperatively to N - WASP when competing against repressive in - teractions . ( A ) Cdc42 z GTP g S inhibits Arp2 / 3 binding to a GST—control region fragment ( 27 ) . ( B ) PIP 2 vesicle binding assays ( 29 ) show that Cdc42 z GTP g S and PIP 2 can simultaneously bind the control region ( B - GBD ) . S indicates superna - tant ( unbound ) and P indicates pellet ( bound ) . Cdc42 z GTP g S does not bind to PIP 2 vesicles in the absence of the control region ( not shown ) . ( C ) Cdc42 z GTP g S enhances mini—N - WASP bind - ing to PIP 2 . In the absence of Cdc42 , mini—N - WASP binds poorly to PIP 2 , most likely because the GBD - VCA interaction sterically masks the PIP 2 - binding site . High - af(cid:222)nity PIP 2 binding is observed if Cdc42 is present , or if the VCA domain is removed . The cooperative effects be - tween Cdc42 and PIP 2 are not observed for binding to the control region alone ( B - GBD ) . ( D ) PIP 2 enhances apparent af(cid:222)nity of Cdc42 for the control region—Arp2 / 3 complex . Dissociation constants for the control region interaction with (cid:223)uorescently tagged Cdc42 ( 32 ) , either alone ( K d ) or with additional factors ( K dapp ) , were mea - sured as described in Web (cid:222)g . 2 ( 30 ) . We added 2 . 5 m M of Arp2 / 3 or 10 m M of PIP 2 ( PC : PS : PIP 2 at ratios of 48 : 48 : 2 ) , or both . The presence of Arp2 / 3 signi(cid:222)cantly decreases the apparent af - (cid:222)nity , as expected , because Arp2 / 3 competes against Cdc42 for binding to the control region ( A ) . However , addition of PIP 2 with Arp2 / 3 re - stores the higher apparent af(cid:222)nity , indicating that PIP 2 and Cdc42 cooperate to compete against Arp2 / 3 binding . Cooperation is not ob - served in the absence of Arp2 / 3 . Fig . 4 . Highly coopera - tive activation mecha - nism of N - WASP allows for potent signal inte - gration . ( A ) Thermody - namic cycle modeling states of Cdc42 ( green ) and PIP 2 ( purple ) bind - ing to mini—N - WASP . Binding of a second in - put molecule is more fa - vorable , because the en - ergetic cost of disrupt - ing the closed state is paid by binding of the (cid:222)rst input molecule . The degree of enhancement in binding is given by the cooperativity factor , c .

Inter - cepts give the dissociation constants for binding of each input molecule alone . Dependence of the curves on the cooperativity constant , c , is also shown , as are experimentally determined concentrations of input molecules required to achieve 50 % activation of mini—N - WASP ( open circles ) . Each point represents a series of (cid:222)ve or six actin polymerization assays in which the concentration of one activator is (cid:222)xed and the concentration of the second activator is varied [ Web (cid:222)g . 3 ( 30 ) ] .

With high cooperativity , coincident signals are integrated and ampli(cid:222)ed . R E P O R T S 27 OCTOBER 2000 VOL 290 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 804 The activation behavior of N - WASP can thus be modeled , using the thermodynamic cycle shown in Fig . 4A . In the repressed state , a network of interactions holds the N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex in a closed state . Cdc42 and PIP 2 can individually disrupt this network and activate the complex . However , because their binding sites are masked by repressive interactions , binding of either in - put alone to the closed state is relatively weak . In contrast , if one input molecule is prebound , the closed state is destabilized , and binding of the second molecule is consider - ably enhanced . The degree to which binding of one ligand enhances binding of the other is determined by the cooperativity factor , c . This behavior is analogous to that of any cooperative binding protein , such as hemo - globin ( 18 , 19 ) , although in this case , coop - erativity is observed between heterotropic rather than homotropic ligands . Nonetheless , both mechanisms involve increasing stabili - zation of an open or relaxed state by binding of successive ligands . This framework reveals that a highly co - operative activation mechanism allows for potent signal integration . A series of simulat - ed contours indicating the concentrations of two activating inputs required to achieve 50 % activation is shown in Fig . 4B . If two input ligands are completely independent ( c 5 1 ) , their combined effects are nearly additive and the 50 % activation contour will be close to linear . In contrast , if c is high , the two ligands will act synergistically . The 50 % activation contour will be concave , because when added together , significantly lower concentrations of each ligand are required for activation . We experimentally measured activation of mini – N - WASP as a function of both Cdc42 and PIP 2 concentration ( Fig . 4B ) . High con - centrations of either input alone ( ; 3 m M Cdc42 or ; 8 m M PIP 2 ) are required to yield 50 % activation . However , costimulation with 10 - fold less of each input yields the same degree of activation . The observed behavior closely fits that predicted by our model with a cooperativity factor of . 100 linking Cdc42 and PIP 2 activation ( 20 ) . These results indicate that N - WASP can exist in a primed state that , although re - pressed , is preloaded with Arp2 / 3 and ready for immediate actin filament assem - bly upon activation ( 21 ) . The high cooper - ativity by which this state of N - WASP is activated allows it to detect and amplify weak but coincident signals of both Cdc42 and PIP 2 ( Fig . 4C ) ( 22 ) . Thus , N - WASP approximates a coincidence detector or a logical “AND” gate , devices whose output is dependent on stimulation by the proper combination of inputs ( 23 ) . The mechanism of N - WASP regulation reveals general principles by which simple protein interac - tion modules , if combined in the proper cooperative fashion , can yield a sophisti - cated signal - integrating machine . Note added in proof : Rohatgi et al . ( 34 ) have recently also identified the basic motif of N - WASP as the PIP 2 responsive element . References and Notes 1 . C . A . Parent , P . N .

The speci(cid:222)c sequence of the basic motif [ NISHT - KEKKKGKAKKKRLTK ( 24 ) ] is essential for repression ; mutation of nine lysines to alanine abolishes repres - sion ( K . E . Prehoda , W . A . Lim , data not shown ) . 12 . The measured af(cid:222)nity for the WASP GBD - VCA inter - action is K d ’ 1 m M ( 9 ) . 13 . K . E . Prehoda , W . A . Lim , data not shown . 14 . Like full - length N - WASP , the degree of mini—N - WASP activation is dependent on the nucleotide state of Cdc42 ( 5 ) . Our (cid:222)ndings with mini—N - WASP show that the enabled / VASP homology 1 ( EVH1 ) domain and proline - rich region are unnecessary for this mode of regulation . These other domains may be involved in targeting [ V . Moreau et al . , Nature Cell Biol . 2 , 441 ( 2000 ) ] or in modes of regulation distinct from that mediated by the control region . Our (cid:222)nd - ings contradict previous suggestions that the EVH1 domain is the input point for PIP 2 activation ( 5 ) [ H . Miki , K . Miura , T . Takenawa , EMBO J . 15 , 5326 ( 1996 ) ; K . E . Prehoda , D . J . Lee , W . A . Lim , Cell 97 , 471 ( 1999 ) ] . We found that the N - WASP EVH1 domain is a peptide - binding module and does not bind acidic phospholipids ( K . E . Prehoda , J . A . Scott , W . A . Lim , in preparation ) . 15 . Addition of high concentrations of the control region can apparently inhibit interaction of Arp2 / 3 with the VCA domain . However , interpretation of this exper - iment is complicated by our subsequent (cid:222)nding that there is a second Arp2 / 3 - binding site in the control region ( see below ) which can , at stoichiometric ex - cess , competitively deplete available Arp2 / 3 . 16 .

This value is likely to be a lower estimate for the cooperativity in vivo , since activated Cdc42 is nor - mally prenylated [ F . L . Zhang , P . J . Casey , Annu . Rev . Biochem . 65 , 241 ( 1996 ) ] . Thus , both inputs would be restricted to the membrane , and their effective con - centrations with respect to one another would be even higher . 21 . These results show that exclusion of Arp2 / 3 is not required for repression . However , it is possible that other elements in full - length N - WASP function by blocking Arp2 / 3 binding . 22 . This model predicts that N - WASP will have a limited range of optimal sensitivity . High concentrations of either individual input can overload the system , con - sistent with observations that either overexpression of a Cdc42 exchange factor [ Y . Zheng et al . , J . Biol . Chem . 271 , 33169 ( 1996 ) ] or phosphoinositide 5 - ki - nase [ A . L . Rozelle et al . , Curr . Biol . 10 , 311 ( 2000 ) ] results in unregulated actin polymerization . N - WASP(cid:213)s signal integration properties are likely op - timized for the physiologically relevant range of input concentrations , just as the oxygen - binding properties of hemoglobin are set for the observed range of oxygen partial pressure [ M . Perutz , Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins ( Cambridge Univ . Press , Cambridge , 1990 ) ] . 23 . H . R . Bourne , R . Nicoll , Cell ( Suppl . ) 72 , 65 ( 1993 ) . 24 .

N - WASP fragments were cloned by polymerase chain reaction from a rat cDNA library . Proteins were ex - pressed as fusions to either a polyhistidine tag or glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) . Proteins were ex - pressed in Escherichia coli ( BL21 - DE3 ) and puri(cid:222)ed by chromatography on Ni - NTA resin ( Qiagen ) or gluta - thione agarose resin ( Sigma ) , followed by Source S or Q resins ( Pharmacia ) . The polyhistidine tag was re - moved by incubation with tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease , except when required for detection in Western blots . 26 . Actin polymerization assays were performed as de - scribed [ L . M . Machesky et al . , Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . U . S . A . 96 , 3739 ( 1999 ) ] . Brie(cid:223)y , polymerization of actin doped with 1 . 2 % pyrene - labeled actin was monitored via change in (cid:223)uorescence ( excitation : 366 nm ; emission : 407 nm ) . Before the reaction , actin was converted from the Ca - ATP to the Mg - ATP form by adding MgCl 2 and EGTA to (cid:222)nal concentrations of 50 and 200 m M , respectively , and incubating at 25¡C for 2 min . To initiate polymerization , actin was added to a solution containing Arp2 / 3 and any other factors at 20¡C . Final conditions were 2 . 5 m M total actin , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 1 mM DTT in a volume of 100 m l . Arp2 / 3 and actin were puri(cid:222)ed from Acan - thamoeba castelanii as described in the above refer - ence . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was pyrene - labeled as described [ S . MacLean - Fletcher , T . D . Pollard , Cell 20 , 329 ( 1980 ) ] . 27 . GST - fusion binding assays were performed by im - mobilizing GST - fusion proteins on glutathione aga - rose beads ( Sigma ) . We incubated 5 m l of beads with the appropriate target proteins in binding buffer [ 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ] in a total volume of 100 m l ( (cid:222)nal GST - fusion concentration of ; 10 m M ) . After gentle rotation at 4¡C for 30 min , beads were washed three times with 1 ml binding buffer plus 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 . Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS—polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and visualized by coomassie blue staining or by Western blotting with anti - Arp2 or anti - poly - histidine antibodies ( Qiagen ) . 28 . Human Cdc42 was expressed in E . coli as a fusion to GST , and activated by incubating with 100 m M GTP g S for 30 min at room temperature , followed by addition of MgCl 2 to a 10 mM (cid:222)nal concentra - tion [ C . Egile et al . , J . Cell Biol . 146 , 1319 ( 1999 ) ] . The GST tag was removed by thrombin cleavage at 4¡C for 2 hours , followed by puri(cid:222)cation on a Source Q column . Vesicles containing phosphati - dylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PIP ) or PIP 2 ( 48 : 48 : 4 of dibromo - phosphatidyl choline : phosphatidyl serine : PIP or PIP 2 ) were prepared by dissolving phospho - lipids in chloroform , drying under nitrogen , resus - pending in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT , and passaging through . 10 freeze - thaw / bath sonication cycles . Approximate concen - trations of PIP 2 or PIP were calculated by dividing the total concentration by two , since 50 % of the total was assumed to be on the inside layer of the vesicles . 29 . Cosedimentation lipid vesicle binding assays were performed as described [ J . M . Kavran et al . , J . Biol . Chem . 273 , 30497 ( 1998 ) ] by mixing 3 m M protein and vesicles ( ; 20 m M PIP or PIP 2 ) in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT ( total assay volume 65 m l ) , incubating at 25¡C for 10 min , and centrifuging at 100 , 000 g for 1 hour . The vesicle pellet was washed with 200 m l of buffer and suspended in a volume of buffer equal to the supernatant . Bound ( pellet ) and unbound proteins ( supernatant ) were identi(cid:222)ed by SDS - PAGE . 30 .

Although we found that repressed mini—N - WASP R E P O R T S www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 290 27 OCTOBER 2000 805 still interacts with Arp2 / 3 , we do not know wheth - er Arp2 / 3 binds to a composite site including ele - ments from both the VCA and B - GBD fragments ( as modeled in Fig . 2D ) , or if it only interacts with the B - GBD site . We only know that the second binding site helps shift the VCA - Arp2 / 3 complex into a nonproductive conformation . 32 . M . G . Rudolph et al . , J . Biol . Chem . 273 , 18067 ( 1998 ) . 33 . Simulation of cooperativity model .

H . Goldman , 2 Michael Lichten 1 * During meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , DNA replication occurs 1 . 5 to 2 hours before recombination initiates by DNA double - strand break formation . We show that replication and recombination initiation are directly linked . Blocking meiotic replication prevented double - strand break formation in a replication - checkpoint—independent manner , and delaying replication of a chromosome segment speci(cid:222)cally delayed break formation in that segment . Consequently , the time between replication and break formation was held constant in all regions . We suggest that double - strand break formation occurs as part of a process initiated by DNA replication , which thus determines when meiotic recombination initiates on a regional rather than a cell - wide basis . During meiosis in most organisms , division of the diploid genome among haploid ga - metes is accompanied by frequent recombi - nation between homologous parental chro - mosomes . Recombination occurs after meiot - ic DNA replication but before the first mei - otic division . In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , blocking meiotic replication has been shown to prevent recombination ( 1 – 4 ) , but the connection between these two funda - mental processes remains unknown . A repli - cation dependence of meiotic recombination would be expected if replication - inhibited cells could not form the double - strand breaks ( DSBs ) that initiate recombination . This could result either from a direct coupling between replication and DSBs or from check - point systems that sense incomplete replica - tion and prevent DSB formation . To test these suggestions , we examined DSBs in cells undergoing meiosis in the pres - ence of 100 mM hydroxyurea ( HU ) , a con - centration that prevents DNA replication ( 4 ) . In such conditions , meiotic progression is normally blocked before the first nuclear di - vision ( meiosis I ) by the MEC1 - dependent checkpoint system ; progression is restored in mec1 - 1 mutants ( 4 ) . Wild - type cells sporu - lated in HU did not form DSBs , and meiotic progression was blocked ( 5 ) . By contrast , about 40 % of mec1 - 1 mutant cells progressed through the meiosis I in the presence of HU , but DSBs still did not form ( Fig . 1 ) . Thus , the failure to form DSBs without replication is not due to a MEC1 - dependent checkpoint block to meiotic progression , making it likely that replication is directly required for DSB formation . This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that clb5 clb6 double mutants , which prevent meiotic replication without in - ducing the MEC1 block ( 4 ) , also fail to form DSBs ( 6 ) . To further examine the relation between replication and DSBs , we used two methods to delay replication in the left arm of chro - mosome III ( chr III - L ) . One approach used an ars305 ars306 ars307 triple mutation to in - activate all meiotic replication origins on chr III - L ( 7 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . The ars305 ars306 ars307 chr III - L is replicated passively by forks initiating at ARS309 on the right arm ( chr III - R ) or further to the right , at least 126 kb from the left - hand telomere . On the basis of a fork progression rate of 2 kb / min ( 8 ) , replication of the ars305 ars306 ars307 chr III - L should take at least 40 min longer than when these origins are present and ac - tive . The other approach used a reciprocal translocation ( his4 : : TEL1 - L , Fig . 2A ) , re - placing the first 70 kb of chromosome III with the first 4 kb of chromosome I ( TEL1 - L ) . This places TEL1 - L next to the HIS4 - CEN3 region , which undergoes frequent DSBs ( 9 ) and contains the early - firing origin ARS306 ( 10 ) . Yeast telomeres are late replicating and impose this property on nearby sequences ( 11 , 12 ) , so this translocation should delay replication in the HIS4 - CEN3 region . We monitored meiotic replication on chromosome III by two - dimensional ( 2D ) gel electrophoresis of replication intermediates ( 13 ) . Replication occurred simultaneously at three locations on the normal chromosome III ( Fig . 2D ) . By contrast , in ars305 ars306 ars307 strains , replication on chr III - L was delayed by 60 min relative to chr III - R ( Fig . 2 , B and D ) , as expected if chr III - L was repli - cated passively by forks initiating on chr III - R . On his4 : : TEL1 - L , replication in the HIS4 - CEN3 region was delayed by 30 min relative to chr III - R ( Fig . 2D ) , and most ARS306 ori - gin activity was eliminated ( 5 ) , as expected for a telomere position effect on replication . Delaying replication did not markedly af - fect DSB frequencies on chr III - L , as mea - sured from blots of pulsed - field gels ( Fig . 2C ) . Maximum DSB levels on the ars305 ars306 ars307 chr III - L were identical to those on the normal chromosome ( 20 % 6 6 % compared with 20 % 6 5 % ) , as were break levels at individual sites ( 5 ) . DSBs between HIS4 and CEN3 on his4 : : TEL1 - L were mod - estly reduced ( 6 6 2 % compared with 12 6 2 % on a normal chromosome ) , the reduction being stronger near TEL1 than near CEN3 . However , delaying replication locally had a distinct , reproducible effect on DSB timing ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . DSBs formed simulta - neously ( 1 . 5 to 2 hours after replication ) in both arms of the normal chromosome III . By contrast , overall DSB formation in the late - replicating ars305 ars306 ars307 chr III - L was delayed by 30 min compared with chr III - R ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Thus , the time interval between replication and DSB forma - tion was maintained in both arms . Further - more , the DSB delay in the originless chr III - L varied with distance from active right - arm 1 Laboratory of Biochemistry , Division of Basic Sci - ence , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD 20892—4255 , USA . 2 Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology , University of Shef(cid:222)eld , Shef(cid:222)eld S10 2TN , UK . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .
