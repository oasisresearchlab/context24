ATMs are known to exhibit marked functional heterogene - ity . M1 ATMs produce inflammatory cytokines and induce insulin resistance . On the other hand , the majority of ATMs in lean individuals are M2 ATMs , which have anti - inflammatory potential . We found that M1 and M2 ATMs can be clearly distinguished using CD11c and CD206 as markers , and that both the number of the M1 and M2 ATMs and the M1 / M2 ratio are correlated with the degree of insulin resistance . M1 / M2 polarity in the adipose tissue is influenced not only by the level of secretion of various polarizing adipokines and chemokines , but also by factors in the local microenvironment , such as hypoxia . M1 ATMs acquire their polarity via activation of hypoxia - inducible factor - 1α ( HIF - 1α ) by local hypoxia , and absence of HIF - 1α in the myeloid cells appears to enhance insulin sensitivity by promoting angiogenesis in adipose tissue . On the other hand , the resident M2 ATMs interact with adipose tissue progenitors to control adiposity . Thus , beyond their role as immunoregulatory cells , the M1 / M2 ATMs also regulate the microenvironment in the adipose tissue and control insulin sensitivity . Recently , we have shown that interventions in the gut microbiota may be effective in controlling obesity - induced chronic inflammation . Control of M1 / M2 ATM polarity is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance associated with obesity . Keywords Insulin resistance · Macrophage · Inflammation · Obesity · Microbiota Introduction Development of obesity - associated insulin resistance is pro - moted by systemic inflammation caused by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines , such as TNFα , IL - 6 , MCP - 1 , and IL - 1β , and the major site of inflammation is the adipose tissue . Increased number of ATMs strongly contributes to its mechanisms [ 1 , 2 ] . ATMs show highly heterogeneous char - acteristics , and include at least two major populations called the classically activated , or M1 , ATMs and alternatively activated , or M2 , ATMs [ 3 ] . Originally , the concept of M1 and M2 macrophages was derived from in vitro studies . M1 macrophages are mainly induced by Th1 signaling , involv - ing factors such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and IFNγ , and express high levels of inflammatory cytokines . M2 mac - rophages , on the other hand , are induced by Th2 signaling , involving factors such as IL - 4 and IL - 13 , and are associated with anti - inflammatory reactions . In healthy adipose tissue , more than 90 % of the ATMs are of the M2 phenotype , which exhibit anti - inflammatory potential . As obesity progresses , Ly6c + inflammatory monocytes recruited into the adi - pose tissue differentiate into M1 ATMs and cluster around necrotic adipocytes , forming crown - like structures ( CLSs ) to phagocytose dead adipocytes [ 4 , 5 ] . In 2007 , Lumeng et al . proposed CD11c as a marker of M1 ATMs and reported that CD11c + macrophages are a major population of cells recruited into obese adipose tissue [ 6 ] . While , through the use of this marker , we recognized the relationship between the recruitment of M1 ATMs and insulin resistance , the pre - cise involvement of M2 ATMs remains poorly understood . * Shiho Fujisaka shihof @ med . u - toyama . ac . jp 1 First Department of Internal Medicine , Faculty of Medicine , Academic Assembly , University of Toyama , 2630 Sugitani , Toyama 930 - 0194 , Japan 75 The role of adipose tissue M1 / M2 macrophages in type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 3 Characteristics of M1 / M2 macrophages in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance Immunohistochemistry of obese adipose tissue showed that Mac2 + / CD11c + M1 ATMs formed CLS , while Mac2 + / CD11c− ATMs , which include M2 ATMs , locate in isolation ( Fig . 1 ) . To identify CD11c− M2 macrophages more precisely , we separated the ATMs by flow cytom - etry using CD11c and CD206 as markers of M1 and M2 macrophages , respectively ; this method allowed CD11c + CD206− M1 ATMs and CD11c− CD206 + M2 ATMs to be clearly distinguished ( Fig . 2 ) . In addition , the gene expression profiles of each of these cell fractions were significantly different . While M1 ATMs showed higher expression levels of inflammation - related genes , such as TNFα , IL - 6 and MCP - 1 than M2 ATMs , the M2 ATMs expressed higher expression levels of anti - inflammatory genes , such as IL - 10 ( Fig . 2 ) . Under the lean condition , more than 90 % of ATMs are of the M2 phenotype , with only around 1−5 % being of the M1 phenotype . In obese adipose , both the numbers of M1 and M2 ATMs are markedly increased , although recruitment of M1 ATMs is more striking , resulting in an increase of the M1 / M2 ratio . This M1 / M2 phenotypic switch is observed specifi - cally in the visceral adipose tissue , and the increase in M1 Fig . 1 Immunohistochemistry of adipose tissue in obese mice . Green : Mac2 Red : CD11c Fig . 2 Representative flow cytometry result and gene expression patterns of M1 / M2 ATMs . Blue dots show isotype control 76 S . Fujisaka 1 3 macrophages is not as significant in the subcutaneous adi - pose tissue [ 7 , 8 ] . Treatment with the insulin - sensitizing PPARγ agonist , pioglitazone , or with the PPARγ partial agonist , telmisartan , decreased not only the number of both types of ATMs , but also the M1 / M2 ratio , suggest - ing that both the absolute numbers of M1 and M2 ATMs and the M1 / M2 ratio are associated with the insulin sen - sitivity [ 7 , 9 ] . Adipose tissue hypoxia induces M1 polarity via activation of HIF‑1α in obesity As obesity progresses , adipose tissue is exposed to hypoxia due to decreased capillary density [ 10 ] , lower blood flow [ 11 ] and insufficient induction of VEGF expression in obe - sity [ 8 , 12 ] . We found that M1 ATMs are more hypoxic and show higher expression levels of inflammation - and hypoxia - related genes than M2 ATMs , such as TNFα , IL - 6 and IL - 1β than M2 ATMs . Increased levels of these genes were observed in bone marrow - derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) cultured under the hypoxic condition , suggested that hypoxia in obese adipose tissue induces the inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages . Furthermore , this acquisition of M1 polar - ity induced by hypoxia was partially abrogated in HIF - 1α knockout BMDMs , indicating the significance of HIF1 α in inducing the inflammatory M1 ATMs in obese adipose tissue [ 8 ] . Next , we examined the involvement of HIF - 1α in mac - rophages in glucose metabolism . We found that myeloid cell - specific HIF - 1α deletion protected against high - fat diet ( HFD ) - induced inflammation , CLS formation , and poor vas - culature development in obese adipose tissue and systemic insulin resistance . Despite the reduced VEGFa expression in the epididymal adipose tissue ( eWAT ) , the endothelial cells and preadipocytes in HIF - 1α - knockout mice showed higher expression levels of angiogenic genes , such as VEGFa , Angpt1 , Fgf1 , and Fgf10 , associated with enhanced angio - genesis in the eWAT [ 13 ] . Thus , in obesity , adipose tissue hypoxia promotes the acquisition of M1 polarity via HIF - 1α activation , and the HIF - 1α in M1 ATMs suppresses neo - angiogenesis through interacting with preadipocytes and endothelial cells ; thus , hypoxia triggers a vicious cycle and exacerbates the development of insulin resistance . A novel role of CD206 + M2 ATMs : a niche for adipocyte progenitors Several lines of evidence have reported that the resident ATMs in the adipose tissue are involved in maintaining insulin sensitivity through their anti - inflammatory functions , while interacting with other immune cells , such as Treg cells , eosinophils and invariant natural killer cells [ 14 – 18 ] . Although the majority of ATMs are of the M2 phenotype in the lean state , the roles of M2 ATMs in maintaining the adipose tissue microenvironment are not yet fully under - stood . To investigate the involvement of M2 ATMs in adi - pose tissue and glucose metabolism , we generated a mouse model with partial depletion of CD206 + M2 macrophages induced by diphtheria toxin ( DT ) administration . We found that the depletion of CD206 + M2 macrophages promoted the proliferation of adipocyte progenitors ( APs ) , which sub - sequently differentiated into mature adipocytes . As a result , while the adipocyte sizes significantly reduced , the numbers of adipocytes increased in the eWAT , which were associated with improved glucose metabolism . In regard to the under - lying mechanism , M2 ATMs show high expression levels of transforming growth factor ( TGF ) - β , which is reportedly involved in inhibiting proliferation / differentiation of various cells , including preadipocytes , and melanocyte - and hemat - opoietic stem cells [ 19 – 21 ] . Indeed , genes downstream of TGF - β and pSmad 2 / 3 signaling were downregulated after CD206 + M2 A™ depletion , followed by proliferation of APs . Thus , CD206 + M2 ATMs appear to suppress the pro - liferation of APs via the TGF - β signaling pathway [ 22 ] . Moreover , we found that CD206 + M2 A™ depletion pro - moted browning of cold - stimulated inguinal adipose tissue , by inducing an increase in the number of PDGFRα + Sca1 + progenitors . Taken together , CD206 + M2 ATMs constitute a microenvironment for APs , in a TGF - β - dependent man - ner , to maintain systemic insulin sensitivity by tuning the quiescence / proliferation balance of APs to adapt to changes in the nutritional status . Intervention of the gut microbiota affected diet‑induced inflammation and glucose metabolism We elucidated the role of M1 / M2 ATMs , which have a great impact on the control of chronic inflammation and adipose tissue microenvironment . As the next step , we focused on the gut microbiota as a novel modifier of glucose metabolism . The gut microbiota is reported to be involved in the regula - tion of the host’s energy balance , glucose and lipid metab - olism , and the immune response [ 23 – 26 ] . We have previ - ously shown that different strains of mice and mice from different vendors exhibit different rates of obesity following HFD feeding . C57BL / 6 J mice from Jax Labs ( B6J ) and 129 mice from Taconic ( 129 T ) are obesity - prone , while 129 mice from Jax ( 129 J ) are obesity - resistant . This difference between the 129 mice is , at least in part , due to differences in the gut microbiome between the mice from these two vendors [ 27 ] . To further explore the role of the microbiome in obesity , we treated these three strains of mice with either vancomycin ( to kill gram - positive bacteria ) or metronidazole ( to kill anaerobic bacteria ) , and challenged them with an HFD . 16S rRNA sequencing showed that both antibiotics changed the microbiome composition in all the strains . In 77 The role of adipose tissue M1 / M2 macrophages in type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 3 the B6J mice , which tend to have genetically inflammatory potential and show insulin resistance , antibiotics improved the glucose metabolism , decreased the serum TNFα levels , decreased the number of inflammatory macrophages in the liver and adipose tissue , and improved insulin signaling . This improvement of glucose metabolism could be repro - duced by transferring the gut bacteria isolated from anti - biotic - treated donors to HFD - fed B6J mice . Metabolomic analysis showed that HFD and antibiotics changed the serum metabolite profile , including prominent changes in the bile acids and levels of the anti - inflammatory bile acid receptor TGR5 expressed in the liver Kupffer cells . These changes could also be reproduced , in part , by treatment with a TGR5 agonist in the B6J mice . In contrast , antibiotic treatment of HFD - fed 129 J or 129 T mice , which are genetically resistant to diet - induced inflammation , did not improve the metabolic profile , despite causing equally dramatic changes in the gut microbiota and in the levels of different serum bile acids . These mice also failed to show improved glucose tolerance in response to treatment with the TGR5 agonist . Thus , anti - biotic modification of the gut microbiota , acting through changes in the bile acids and inflammatory signaling , can improve insulin signaling and glucose metabolism . However , these effects are strain - dependent and partly dependent on bile acids , indicating the important interactions of the gut microbiome with the host genetics , bile acid metabolism and inflammatory potential [ 28 ] . To further explore the relationships between the meta - bolic phenotype , gut microbiota and other host factors , we performed LC – MS - based metabolomics of the cecal contents and plasma of B6J , 129 J and 129 T mice reared on chow , an HFD , and an HFD containing vancomycin or metronidazole . The cecal and plasma metabolite profiles showed multifold differences reflecting the combined and integrated effects of the antibiotics contained in the diet , the host genetic background , and the gut microbiome . Interest - ingly , among the approximately 400 identified metabolites profiled in the plasma using untargeted LC – MS , 18 plasma metabolites showed strong positive or negative correlations with the host insulin resistance across strains and diets . Thus , the diet , host genetics and gut microbiota interact to create distinct responses in the plasma metabolites , contrib - uting to regulation of the metabolism and degree of insulin resistance [ 29 ] . Bofutsushosan improves chronic inflammation and insulin resistance through modification of the gut microbiota‑pleiotropic effect of a Japanese herbal medicine Recent studies have revealed that obesity and intake of a high - fat diet cause dysbiosis , characterized by decreased bacterial diversity and a decrease in the population of Akkermansia muciniphila ( Akk ) ; the mucous layer of the intestinal epithelium becomes thin and the expressions of tight - junction - related proteins decrease . In this “leaky gut , ” the intestinal permeability increases and the lipopolysac - charides derived from Gram - negative bacteria flow into the circulation . This causes the activation of Toll - like receptor 4 ( TLR - 4 ) signaling , promoting systemic inflammation [ 30 ] . Indeed , obese subjects and rodents exhibit higher plasma endotoxin levels , which have been shown to be correlated with insulin resistance . Therefore , it would be beneficial to identify factors that can restore the barrier function , as pos - sible targets for alleviating obesity - related inflammation and insulin resistance . Recently , many products available in the market , besides antibiotics , have been reported to have an impact on the gut microbiota [ 31 ] . We found that Bofutsushosan ( BFT ) , a Japanese herbal medicine , which has been clinically used for constipation in obese patients , ameliorates systemic inflammation and glucose metabolism by modifying the gut microbiota in mice fed an HFD . The changes in the bacte - rial composition mainly involved a bloom of Akk , which are bacteria that are known to improve the gut barrier func - tion . BFT administration increased the expression levels of claudin - 1 , a tight - junction - related protein , in the colon , and alleviated endotoxemia . Antibiotic treatment abrogated the metabolic improvement that accrued from BFT treatment . Furthermore , the improved glucose metabolism could be reproduced by cecal bacterial transfer , suggesting that BFT modifies the gut microbiota with an increase of Akk , con - tributing to improving the gut barrier function and prevent - ing metabolic endotoxemia , and consequently , to attenuation of diet - induced inflammation and insulin resistance ( Fig . 3 ) [ 32 ] . Intervention of the gut microbiota can be a novel con - cept in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism through alleviating obesity - induced systemic inflammation . Conclusions and future perspectives We focused on the role of chronic inflammation in the patho - physiology of obesity - induced insulin resistance . To analyze the effect of macrophage polarity in the adipose tissue on glucose metabolism in greater detail , we developed a method for accurately separating M2 macrophages using CD206 as a marker , and investigated the involvement of the M1 / M2 macrophages in the development of insulin resistance and the adipose tissue microenvironment ( Fig . 4 ) . Today , many researchers use this method to evaluate chronic inflamma - tion in the adipose tissue , to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of insulin resistance . Furthermore , we clarified the impact of the gut microbiota on the control of chronic inflammation caused by obesity . Demonstration of the pleiotropic actions of drugs that are already in clinical 78 S .

We strongly expect future studies to lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for metabolic syndrome via control of obesity - related inflammation .
