Challenges to Combating Toxicity and Harassment in Multiplayer Games : Involving the HCI Games Research Community Julian Frommel j . frommel @ uu . nl Utrecht University Utrecht , Netherlands Regan L . Mandryk regan @ cs . usask . ca University of Saskatchewan Saskatoon , Canada Madison Klarkowski madison @ cs . usask . ca University of Saskatchewan Saskatoon , Canada ABSTRACT Toxicity is and remains a problem in multiplayer games , and can result in harm for players and game environments . Grounded in prior work , we present four challenges that impede solving the problem of toxicity and harassment . We believe that we need to overcome these challenges to ensure safe gaming spaces , and intend to stimulate discussion about how HCI Games research can make substantial contributions toward this goal .

Despite general agreement about the dangers of online toxic behaviour in games [ 1 , 11 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 28 ] , these harmful behaviours persist . Toxi - city has instead become more problematic and widespread—with recent statistics reporting that 83 % of adult gamers experienced harassment in online multiplayer games [ 20 ] , a number that has grown in recent years [ 19 , 20 ] . Toxicity has a multitude of adverse effects for game companies ( e . g . , increased churn [ 13 , 15 , 21 ] ) and for the players themselves ( e . g . , causing distress [ 9 , 10 , 20 , 23 , 27 ] ) , Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page .

We highlight four challenges that we need to overcome before we can hope to eliminate toxic behaviours . ( C1 ) Toxicity is normalized in gaming communities . Our prior research [ 2 ] showed that many players do not report toxic con - tent because they consider it acceptable , inevitable , or typical of games . This normalization of toxicity is further problematic be - cause it begets additional toxicity , as it is often cyclical [ 2 , 15 , 16 ] , and leads to unclear boundaries and the problem of subjectivity ( that is , what does and does not constitute ‘toxicity’ ) . This cyclical normalization of toxic behaviours must be interrupted , or else neg - ative behaviours will continue to be accepted and perpetuated by pursuant generations of players . ( C2 ) The subjectivity of what is toxic represents a huge chal - lenge , and can partially explain why current methods fall short : if we cannot agree on what is acceptable and what is not , how can we implement interventions that enforce this ? We know that individuals perceive toxicity at differing levels of severity [ 3 , 11 ] , and that many factors contribute to this ( e . g . , susceptibility to on - line disinhibition [ 2 ] , game expertise [ 2 ] , and identity [ 12 ] ) . What may be perceived as toxic or harmful by one player , might sim - ply be experienced as acceptable game banter by another [ 1 ] . This highlights that we require more tools that can be used to assess experiences of toxicity such as validated questionnaires , while the inherent subjectivity may remain a challenge that requires more comprehensive , dynamic , and individual solutions . Further , this impedes the implementation of automated methods that could help combat toxicity . ( C3 ) There is still a lack of widely accessible and effective tools to detect toxic behaviour . While research and industry have proposed , implemented , and applied toxicity detection methods ( e . g . , [ 6 , 8 , 24 ] ) , this is not a solved problem . Promising methods often have limi - tations , e . g . , limited applicability beyond specific communication channels [ 24 , 31 ] , applicability to games contexts and inadequacy to account for context [ 5 , 11 ] , or reliance on objective ground truth ratings , which may not represent the reality of how toxicity is ex - perienced in games ( cf . C2 : subjectivity ) . Furthermore , some of the most promising examples are proprietary [ 4 , 6 , 14 , 26 ] , therefore not publicly accessible and of limited use to other small developers or for tackling toxicity across gaming communities . 263 CHI PLAY ’22 EA , November 2 – 5 , 2022 , Bremen , Germany Julian Frommel , Regan L . Mandryk , & Madison Klarkowski ( C4 ) There is a lack of support for people experiencing or witness - ing toxicity in digital spaces . Most current approaches to address toxicity focus on punishing toxic players—for example , with mut - ing or reporting functions that may eventually lead to game bans . While those approaches are important , they are also sometimes underused or misused [ 2 , 17 ] , impeding their effectiveness . Further , they generally still leave targets and witnesses harmed . Our find - ings [ 25 ] indicate that support mechanisms for targeted players may help them cope with negative experiences . We argue that more support is necessary to ensure that games are safe and healthy envi - ronments . However , it is unclear how games can provide access to such support in a way that is effective , unobtrusive , and accepted by a skeptical player base [ 25 ] . For example , some players may not use an effective support method that could help them cope if it impedes their performance or experience ( e . g . , by interrupting gameplay or hindering effective communication ) . Therefore , HCI games re - search is necessary to explore how to design support mechanisms that balance effectiveness and player experience . This list of challenges is by no means comprehensive but high - lights four important challenges that researchers , designers , and developers need to tackle . 3 CONCLUSION Toxicity is and remains a problem in multiplayer games . Combating toxicity is challenging , and requires the concerted efforts of stake - holders involved in games and gaming communities . Importantly , this also includes HCI Games researchers who can contribute in several critical ways . For example : investigating reasons for and how to overcome societal challenges , e . g . , with design frictions , game mechanics , or communication features , may help combat normalization and subjectivity ( C1 / C2 ) , while designing and evalu - ating approaches for prediction and support may fill important gaps currently lacking in the toolset of games and human moderators ( C3 / C4 ) . With this talk , we want to draw attention to the prob - lem of toxicity and what we can do to make gaming environments enjoyable , healthy , and safe spaces for everyone .
