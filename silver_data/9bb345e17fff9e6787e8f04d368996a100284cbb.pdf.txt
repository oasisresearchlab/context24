In this study , we aimed at the pro - duction of antibodies that could neutralize the cytotoxic activities of mycolactone . Methodology / Principal Findings Using the B cell hybridoma technology , we generated a series of monoclonal antibodies with specificity for mycolactone from spleen cells of mice immunized with the protein conju - gate of a truncated synthetic mycolactone derivative . L929 fibroblasts were used as a model system to investigate whether these antibodies can inhibit the biological effects of mycolactone . By measuring the metabolic activity of the fibroblasts , we found that anti - mycolactone mAbs can completely neutralize the cytotoxic activity of mycolactone . Conclusions / Significance The toxin neutralizing capacity of anti - mycolactone mAbs supports the concept of evaluat - ing the macrolide toxin as vaccine target .

Due to the lipid - like nature of mycolactones , the production of antibodies against these molecules has so far been unsuccessful . By using the classical approach of fusing immortal cells with spleen cells of mice immunized with a protein conjugate of a truncated non - toxic synthetic mycolactone , we were able to gener - ate hybridoma cells producing mycolactone - specific monoclonal antibodies . Mammalian cell - based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that these antibodies have neutralizing activity and can fully block the cytotoxic activity of mycolactone , resulting in survival of the target cells . These findings support the concept to target mycolactone by a vaccine . Furthermore , the anti - mycolactone antibodies may represent useful tools for BU diagnostics development . Introduction Mycobacterium ulcerans , the causative agent of the neglected tropical skin disease Buruli ulcer ( BU ) , produces the exotoxin mycolactone , which is responsible for the formation of chronic necrotizing skin lesions [ 1 , 2 ] . Early diagnosis followed by rapid initiation of the currently rec - ommended treatment with rifampicin and streptomycin [ 3 ] is crucial to avoid massive tissue destruction and long - term disabilities . Mycolactones consist of a 12 - membered macrolide core structure , a short C - linked upper side chain ( comprising C12 – C20 ) and a longer C5 - O - linked lower polyunsaturated acyl side chain . Mycolactones produced by different M . ulcerans lineages differ in the structure of the lower side chain , but are otherwise conserved [ 4 ] . For the lower side chain variations in length , the number of double bonds and the number and localization of hydroxyl groups have been described . While M . ulcerans strains may produce mixtures of several mycolactone species , the composition of these pools seems to be highly conserved for a particular M . ulcerans lineage [ 5 ] . Strains belonging to the genomically monomorphic classical African lineage produce the most toxic variant , mycolactone A / B [ 6 ] . This lineage is responsible for > 95 % of the BU cases reported worldwide [ 7 ] . Mycolactone - deficient M . ulcerans mutants are less virulent and intradermal injection of the toxin in animal models is sufficient to induce the formation of BU - like lesions [ 4 , 8 ] . Since mycolactones play such a central role in the pathogenesis of BU [ 1 , 2 , 9 ] , they may represent a suitable target for both vaccine development and passive immunotherapy . However , due to their lipid - like nature , as well as their cytotoxic and immunosuppressive [ 10 – 12 ] activities , attempts to raise antibody responses against mycolactones have failed so far . While extracts from M . ulcerans cultures have been the only source of mycolactones for a long time , highly defined synthetic mycolactones have become available more recently [ 6 , 13 , 14 ] , greatly facili - tating experimental work with these compounds . Here , we generated mycolactone specific immune - sera and monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) by immunizing mice with a protein conju - gate of a non - toxic synthetic truncated mycolactone derivative .

Antibody - Mediated Neutralization of Mycolactone Cytotoxicity PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0004808 June 28 , 2016 2 / 12 Preparation of mycolactone stock solutions Natural mycolactones A / B , C and F as well as variants PG - 157 , PG - 165 , PG - 182 and core PG - 119 were produced as described previously [ 6 , 14 ] . The synthesis of biotin - conjugate PG - 204 and the immunogen PG - 203 will be described elsewhere . All compounds were HPLC - purified . For biological testing 0 . 5 mg / ml mycolactone stock solutions were made by adding cell culture grade DMSO ( Sigma ) . Extracts of mycolactone were prepared using mycobacterial pellets from cultures of strains isolated from lesions of Cameroonian BU patients ( S1013 , S1019 , S1047 ) . Briefly , 1 ml of a chloroform - methanol solution ( 2 : 1 , v / v ) was added to the individual pellets . Bacteria were resuspended by vortexing and lipids were extracted by incubating the samples shaking at RT for 2 h . Then , 200 μ L ddH 2 O were added to induce a phase separation . After vigorous vortex - ing , the samples were centrifuged for 10 min and the lower organic phase was transferred to a fresh tube . Samples were placed in a Speedvac ( Thermo Scientific ) for complete drying . 50 μ L acetone were added and after an additional spin for 10 min at maximal speed , the acetone - solu - ble lipid fraction containing mycolactones was separated from the precipitate , collected in fresh tubes and again dried using the Speedvac device . For biological testing , the acetone - solu - ble lipid fractions were resuspended in cell culture grade DMSO ( Sigma ) . Immunization of mice 2 mg of mycolactone PG - 203 were coupled to 2 mg of BSA using the Imject EDC BSA spin kit ( Pierce ) . NMRI mice ( Harlan Laboratories ) were immunized thrice in 3 week intervals by sub - cutaneous injection of 40 μ g of the coupled product emulsified in Sigma adjuvant . Serum anti - body titers against the biotinylated mycolactone derivative PG - 204 were tested by ELISA . Based on the ELISA results , one NMRI mouse was selected to receive a final intravenous injec - tion of 40 μ g of the PG - 203 - BSA conjugate without adjuvant . Three days after this last booster dose , hybridoma cell lines were generated as described below . Generation of monoclonal antibodies Mice were euthanized and the spleen was aseptically removed . Spleen tissue was mashed and the cells were fused with PAI myeloma cells in the presence of PEG 1500 ( Roche ) [ 15 ] . Mother cell line culture supernatants were tested by ELISA for the presence of anti - mycolactone antibodies and positive lines were cloned by limiting dilution . mAbs were purified from hybridoma culture supernatants by affinity chromatography using a HiTrap Protein A HP column ( GE Healthcare ) . Isotypes were determined by ELISA with isotype specific reagents ( SouthernBiotech ) . ELISA NeutrAvidin Coated High Capacity plates ( Thermo Scientific ) were incubated with 2 μ g / ml biotinylated mycolactone PG - 204 in PBS for 2 h at 37°C in the dark . The PG - 204 solution was then replaced by SuperBlock T20 ( TBS ) blocking buffer ( Thermo Scientific ) . Plates were incu - bated for 1 h at 37°C in the dark , then washed twice with PBS 0 . 05 % Tween . Hybridoma super - natants were applied to the plates for 2 h at 37°C in the dark . Plates were washed four times with PBS 0 . 05 % Tween . Bound anti - mycolactone antibodies were detected using an Alkaline Phosphatase ( AP ) conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG antibody ( Sigma ) diluted 1 : 20 , 000 in block - ing buffer . The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the dark , and then washed four times with PBS 0 . 05 % Tween . Development was done using the Alkaline Phosphatase Yellow ( pNPP ) Liquid Substrate System ( Sigma ) . The absorbance was measured at 405 nm with a microplate reader ( Tecan Sunrise ) and the values were plotted against the concentration .

After washing twice with PBS 0 . 05 % Tween , serial dilutions of synthetic mycolactone compounds were added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C in the dark . DMSO served as negative control . Subse - quently biotinylated PG - 204 was added ( 100 pg / ml ) without washing steps and incubated for an additional 30 min . Plates were washed four times with PBS 0 . 05 % Tween . Bound PG - 204 was detected with alkaline phosphatase coupled streptavidin ( SouthernBiotech ) after 45 min incubation at 37°C . The development was performed as described above . Metabolic activity assays Murine L929 fibroblasts were cultivated at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in RPMI medium ( Gibco ) supple - mented with 10 % FCS ( Sigma ) , 2 mM glutamine ( Gibco ) and 0 . 05 mM β - mercaptoethanol ( Gibco ) . For the assay , L929 cells ( 24 , 000 per well ) were seeded in 24 - well plates ( Falcon ) and incubated o / n at 37°C . Medium was aliquoted and mixed with 15 ng / ml synthetic mycolactone A / B , mycolactone core PG - 119 or varying amounts of mycolactone extracts . Dependent on the assay format , fixed or increasing concentrations of anti - mycolactone antibody or isotype - matching control antibody ( JD4 . 1 ) were added and incubated for 10 min . The medium in the 24 - well plates was aspirated and replaced by 500 μ l medium containing the mycolactone - antibody mixes . After an incubation period of 48 h , Resazurin solution ( Sigma ) was added to the wells ( 10 % v / v ) , and the cells were further incubated for 2 hours at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . In order to quantitatively assess metabolic activities , the fluorescence intensities were measured using a SpectraMax Gemini XS ( Molecular Devices ) , and the obtained values were normalized for the DMSO control . The experiments were set up in duplicates and performed at least three times . Fluorescence intensities were plotted against the log concentration of neutralizing antibody . Surface Plasmon Resonance ( SPR ) analyses SPR experiments were performed on Biacore 3000 or T200 instruments ( GE Healthcare , Upp - sala , Sweden ) at 25°C . HEPES buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) Tween 20 , pH 7 . 4 ) was used as running buffer and flow rates of 5 or 50 μ l min - 1 were used for the immobi - lization and binding assays , respectively . Anti - mycolactone mAbs were captured on the chip surface by primary antibodies . First , the primary antibody was immobilized covalently on the carboxymethyldextran surface of a CM5 sensor ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) . The car - boxymethyl groups of the dextran sensor surface were activated for 600 s with a mixture of 0 . 2 M ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) and 0 . 05 M N - hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) . Next , the primary antibody , a rat anti - mouse IgG1 mAb ( SouthernBiotech , AL , USA ) diluted in 10 mM borate buffer ( pH 8 . 2 ) to a concentration of 20 μ g / ml was contacted for 120 s with the activated sensor surface to achieve antibody densities of 8000 – 12000 RUs . Subsequently , remaining active ester molecules on the sensor were deactivated by applying 1M ethanolamine ( pH 8 . 0 ) for 420 s . Anti - mycolactone mAbs were diluted in running buffer to a concentration of 200 nM and captured by the primary antibodies to achieve antibody densities in the range of 2500 – 4000 RUs . Mycolactone derivative PG - 204 was titrated over the surfaces with the immobilized anti - mycolactone mAbs . Association and dissociation phases were monitored for 240 and 3600 s , respectively . Bound mycolactone was washed out from the surface in regeneration steps ( injec - tion of 10 mM glycine , pH 2 . 2 ) .

Mice had developed strong anti - mycolactone IgG responses after two immunizations with the adjuvanted protein carrier conjugate and a third immunization boosted the immune response further ( Fig 2 ) . Spleen cells of mice immunized with the PG - 203 - BSA conjugate were used for the genera - tion of hybridomas producing anti - mycolactone mAbs by conventional B cell hybridoma tech - nology . Hybridoma cell culture supernatants were screened by ELISA using NeutrAvidin plates coated with PG - 204 ( Fig 1C ) , a biotinylated derivative of PG - 203 . Screening led to the identification of 12 hybridoma clones producing the anti - mycolactone mAbs JD5 . 1 to JD5 . 12 . All twelve mAbs were of the IgG1 isotype and showed binding to PG - 204 , but not to PG - 183 ( Fig 3 ) , a mycolactone derivative biotinylated at the C - linked short upper side chain ( Fig 1D ) . The fine specificity of mAbs was further characterized by competition ELISAs . Plates were coated with anti - mycolactone mAbs and the biotinylated mycolactone derivative PG - 204 was added as reporter molecule . By titrating in increasing amounts of synthetic natural variants of mycolactone ( mycolactone A / B , C and F ) , a truncated synthetic derivative ( PG - 119 ) , or deriva - tives with modifications in the C - linked upper side chain ( PG - 157 , PG - 165 and PG - 182 ) we were able to assess the fine specificity of the binding . All mAbs showed very similar fine speci - ficity patterns ( depicted for the prototype mAb JD5 . 1 in Fig 4 ) . As predicted from the structure of the immunizing truncated mycolactone derivative PG - 203 , the presence / absence or detailed Fig 1 . Synthetic mycolactone derivatives used for the generation and detection of mycolactone specific antibody responses . PG - 203 ( A ) was conjugated to BSA via the amino group on its diethylene glycol - based linker and the carrier protein conjugate was used for the immunization of mice . PG - 204 ( C ) and PG - 183 ( D ) are biotinylated mycolactone derivatives used for analytical purposes . Unmodified synthetic mycolactone A / B ( B ) was used as effector molecule in cytotoxicity assays . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0004808 . g001 Antibody - Mediated Neutralization of Mycolactone Cytotoxicity PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0004808 June 28 , 2016 5 / 12 structure of the C5 - O - linked polyunsaturated lower acyl side chain had no significant effect on binding to the mAbs . PG - 119 , a truncated mycolactone lacking the lower fatty acid acyl side chain was thus as efficient as the complete mycolactones A / B , C and F in competing with the reporter molecule PG - 204 ( Fig 4 ) . In contrast , modifications in the C - linked upper side chain had major effects on the effi - ciency as competitor . The more complex the modifications were , the less competition was observed ( Fig 4 ) , suggesting that the upper side chain along with the mycolactone core consti - tutes part of the epitope of the mAbs . For all mAbs , addition of a terminal hydroxyl group in PG - 165 reduced binding and a major extension of the upper side chain in PG - 182 abrogated competition completely . Only for PG - 157 , a derivative with a slight extension of the upper side chain , a difference in the competi - tion pattern was observed , with only mAbs 5 . 9 and 5 . 11 showing slight inhibition ( the differ - ence is depicted for the prototype mAbs JD5 . 1 and JD5 . 11 in Fig 5 ) .

The association and dissociation rate constants could not be precisely deter - mined as the dissociation rate constants were outside the limitation of the measuring technol - ogy ( Fig 6 ) . For some of the mAbs ( JD5 . 1 , JD5 . 2 , JD5 . 5 , JD5 . 8 and JD5 . 10 ) dissociation rates were extremely slow with the monitored dissociation rate constant outside the limitation of the instrument resolution ( k off < 10 − 6 s - 1 ) . Also the other mAbs showed slow dissociation rates with an estimated k off approximating the resolution limit ( k off between 10 − 5 s - 1 and 10 − 6 s - 1 ) . Measurements with mycolactone A / B failed , most likely due to aggregation of the more hydro - phobic complete toxin molecule . Fig 4 . Effect of structural modifications of mycolactone on antibody binding . Competition ELISAs were performed by coating microtiter plates with the mAbs and pre - incubation with serial dilutions of mycolactone A / B , natural mycolactone variants harboring modifications in the lower fatty acid acyl side chain ( mycolactone C and mycolactone F ) , a truncated core molecule without O - linked lower side chain ( PG - 119 ) or derivatives containing substitutions in the upper side chain ( PG - 165 , PG - 157 and PG - 182 ) . Biotinylated PG - 204 was subsequently added and its binding was detected by using alkaline phosphatase - conjugated streptavidin as reporter . Detailed results with all tested mycolactone derivatives are shown for mAb 5 . 1 as example . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0004808 . g004 Antibody - Mediated Neutralization of Mycolactone Cytotoxicity PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0004808 June 28 , 2016 7 / 12 Toxin neutralizing activity of the anti - mycolactone mAbs To investigate whether mycolactone specific antibodies can neutralize the cytotoxic activity of the macrolide toxin , L929 fibroblasts were incubated with synthetic mycolactone A / B at the cytotoxic concentration of 15 ng / ml ( 20 nM ) in the presence of serially diluted anti - mycolac - tone mAbs . After 48 h of incubation , the metabolic activity of the L929 cells was assessed by performing Resazurin - based assays . While all anti - mycolactone mAbs showed toxin - neutraliz - ing activity , the molar ratio of antibody versus mycolactone required for neutralization varied ( Fig 7 ) . While several mAbs neutralized the toxin completely already at a molar ratio of 2 . 5 , only partial inhibition was observed at a ratio of 12 . 5 for the least active mAb JD5 . 2 ( Fig 7 ) . The morphology of L929 cells treated with mycolactone and sufficient amounts of toxin - neu - tralizing antibody was indistinguishable from that of DMSO - treated control cells .

So far , no antibodies against mycolactone were detected in mice or humans infected with M . ulcerans [ 16 ] and attempts by several groups to generate mycolactone - specific antisera or mAbs by immunization with protein carrier conjugates of chemically modified mycolactone extracted from M . ulcerans cultures have failed before . This may be related to residual cytotoxicity of the conjugates and killing of B cells that incorporated them after binding to their mycolactone specific surface immunoglobulins . With the availabil - ity of synthetic mycolactone derivatives it has become possible to both generate highly defined protein conjugates for immunization and to develop reliable assays for the detection of myco - lactone specific antibodies . For immunization we have used here a carrier conjugate of a myco - lactone derivative in which the C5 - O - linked polyunsaturated acyl side chain was replaced by a diethylene glycol - based linker . Since the structure of the lower side chain is crucially important for the cytotoxic activity of mycolactone [ 6 ] , this compound ( PG - 203 ) was expected to be non - cytotoxic , even if it were released from the carrier protein after massive uptake by mycolactone specific B cells . Coupling of the synthetic mycolactone derivative to the carrier protein BSA ensured T cell help for the mycolactone specific B cells , leading to clonal expansion , affinity maturation and isotype switching . As a result high anti - mycolactone IgG titers were elicited in mice already by two immunizations with the adjuvanted PG - 203 carrier conjugate . All mAbs generated from the immunized mice were of the IgG1 subclass and exhibited high affinity and specificity for mycolactone . Competition assays indicated that the epitope recognized includes elements of the upper short side chain that is C - linked to the core structure . As expected [ 6 ] , structural var - iation or absence of the lower C5 - O - linked lower polyunsaturated acyl side chain had no effect on antibody binding . All mAbs exhibited high affinity binding with very slow dissociation rates which did not permit exact determination of the affinity constant by SPR analyses . Currently , there is no highly effective vaccine against the major mycobacterial diseases tuberculosis , leprosy and BU available . BCG , originally developed against tuberculosis , may offer only partial and short - lasting [ 17 ] or no [ 18 ] protection against BU . Attempts to develop a subunit vaccine [ 16 , 19 , 20 ] or a live vaccine based on mycolactone - deficient M . ulcerans [ 21 ] had limited success . All twelve mycolactone - specific mAbs generated here showed , albeit to a varying degree , the capacity to neutralize mycolactone and to rescue mammalian cells from apoptosis in an in vitro assay . This supports the concept to target mycolactone in BU vaccine design . Both prophylaxis and therapy with toxin - neutralizing antibodies and active immuniza - tion with toxoids are highly successful strategies for protection against pathogens such as diph - theria or tetanus bacteria that produce a toxin as key virulence factor . M . ulcerans has evolved from a common ancestor with M . marinum by acquisition of a plas - mid designated pMUM , which encodes the polyketide synthases required for mycolactone bio - synthesis [ 22 – 24 ] . None of the other pathogenic mycobacteria produce a macrolide toxin , making mycolactone an excellent target for the development of a species specific diagnostic test . Such an assay would also have potential for the monitoring of treatment success by mea - suring mycolactone levels in fine needle aspirates from closed BU lesions or swab samples from ulcerative lesions . The availability of the mAbs described here is enabling the develop - ment of a competition assay for the quantification of mycolactone . If non - competing mAbs specific for the lower part of the core and the lower side chain can be generated , development of an antigen capture assay may become possible . Taken together , the first successful generation of mycolactone specific antibodies described in this report will stimulate development of new tools for research and control of BU .
