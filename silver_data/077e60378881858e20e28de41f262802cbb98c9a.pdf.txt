Dispatch R691 Cytoskeleton : Actin and endocytosis — no longer the weakest link Robert L . Jeng and Matthew D . Welch The actin cytoskeleton has long been believed to play a role in endocytosis , but its actual function in this process has been unclear .

Numerous cortical components , in several distinct pathways , have been shown to be involved in invaginating the plasma membrane and pinching off endocytic vesicles containing engulfed mate - rials . The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in endo - cytic processes , but its necessity and roles in endocytosis remain ambiguous . Most of the evidence suggesting a role for actin in endocytic processes has come from studies in budding yeast , where a genetic relationship between actin and endocytosis is well established . The disruption of genes encoding actin and many actin - binding proteins blocks the uptake of endo - cytic markers ; similarly , screens for endocytosis mutants have frequently identified mutations that affect cytoskele - tal organization [ 1 ] . However , little is known about the mol - ecular mechanisms that underlie these interactions . Studies in animal cells have also suggested a link between actin and endocytosis , but they have generally been less conclu - sive . The addition of compounds that depolymerize the cytoskeleton , or the introduction of mutant forms of Rho GTPases , have had variable affects , depending on the assay and cell type [ 2 , 3 ] . Consequently , the universality of actin function and its possible roles in endocytosis have been questioned . A series of recent studies [ 4 – 7 ] has now strengthened the association between actin and endocytosis in both yeast and mammalian systems . Firstly , these studies have demonstrated that three proteins — cortactin , Abp1p and Pan1p — stimulate the actin nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The identification of Arp2 / 3 complex stim - ulatory activity in these three proteins is exciting because they are some of the first Arp2 / 3 complex activators found outside of the SCAR / WASP family of proteins , and their mechanisms of Arp2 / 3 complex activation appear to be dif - ferent from that of the SCAR / WASP proteins . Secondly , all three proteins have been shown to interact with endocytic proteins , providing evidence that the actin cytoskeleton , and specifically actin nucleation , is involved in endocytosis . The polymerization of actin monomers into linear actin filaments is one of the primary means the actin cytoskele - ton uses to generate force . Although actin monomers can polymerize spontaneously , the nucleation of actin fila - ments can be accelerated by proteins such as the Arp2 / 3 complex . By itself , the Arp2 / 3 complex has limited nucle - ation activity , but its activity is greatly increased in con - junction with activating proteins [ 8 ] . The first such activating protein to be identified is the ActA protein from the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes , which uses actin polymerization to move within its host cells [ 9 ] . Most of the activators identified since then are members of the ubiquitous SCAR / WASP family of proteins [ 8 ] . SCAR / WASP proteins have characteristic domains and bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex through an acidic ( A ) region and a connector ( C ) region ( Figure 1a ) [ 10 ] . A WASP - homology ( WH2 ) domain binds to actin monomers and is also required for activation , perhaps by positioning actin monomers near the Arp2 / 3 complex . Now , three additional Arp2 / 3 complex - activating proteins have been identified : cortactin , Pan1p and Abp1p . Cortactin was originally identified as a substrate for Src kinases [ 11 , 12 ] , while Pan1p was identified as a yeast homolog of the mammalian endocytic protein Eps15 [ 13 ] . Abp1p was first isolated in yeast as an F - actin binding protein [ 14 ] and a homolog exists in mammals [ 15 ] , though the mammalian homolog has not yet been reported to have Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulating activity . These new Arp2 / 3 complex activators show some similarities to SCAR / WASP proteins : all three proteins have a modular organization and bind the Arp2 / 3 complex through an acidic region , although Abp1p has two acidic domains , both of which are necessary for binding ( Figure 1a ) [ 5 – 7 , 16 ] . Despite these similarities , there are significant differ - ences between the activities of these proteins and WASP - family proteins . Most noticeably , the level of stimulation by these three proteins is weaker than that caused by SCAR / WASP proteins . Cortactin is the weakest stimula - tor of the three , and was initially reported to be unable to stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro using protein con - centrations similar to those used for WASP proteins [ 16 ] . Subsequently , the stimulating activity of cortactin was uncovered when much higher Arp2 / 3 complex concentra - tions were used [ 4 , 5 ] . A possible explanation for the lower levels of stimulation by these three proteins is that they R692 Current Biology Vol 11 No 17 require activation by regulatory factors , similar to the Cdc42 - and PIP 2 - mediated activation of some WASP proteins [ 8 ] . One possibility is that endocytic proteins might activate these proteins ( as discussed below ) and localize nucleation to endocytic vesicles . Another major difference between the activity of these three proteins and SCAR / WASP proteins is that , rather than binding to actin monomers , both cortactin and Abp1p require binding to filamentous ( F - ) actin for activity [ 4 – 6 ] — none of the three proteins contains the actin - monomer binding WH2 domains found in WASP - family proteins . Cortactin binds to actin filaments through a series of six 37 - amino acid tandem repeats [ 5 , 16 ] , while Abp1p binds F - actin through an actin - depolymerizing factor homology ( ADH ) domain ( Figure 1a ) [ 6 ] . A requirement for actin - filament binding has not yet been demonstrated for Pan1p , but the Pan1p acidic region has been shown to be insufficient for activation and might require binding to actin filaments [ 7 ] . Nucleation mediated by WASP proteins and the Arp2 / 3 complex also leads to the generation of actin branches . The Arp2 / 3 complex mediates actin - filament branching by binding to the end of one filament and the side of another filament [ 17 ] . However , these branches steadily dissipate over time . In addition to its Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulating activity , cortactin has a novel branch - stabilizing activity which has not been found in WASP - family proteins . Cor - tactin prevents filament debranching , thereby promoting the formation of actin networks [ 4 ] . These differences in Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulating activity and debranching activ - ity suggest that these three proteins have different cellular functions than SCAR / WASP proteins , and may be used in cellular processes where lower levels of nucleation or increased branching are required .

WASP proteins interact with Arp2 / 3 complex through connector ( C ) and acidic ( A ) domains . WASP binds actin monomers ( G - actin ) through the WH2 domain . Cortactin , Pan1p and Abp1p also bind Arp2 / 3 complex through an acidic domain ; Abp1p requires two acidic domains . Rather than binding actin monomers , cortactin binds actin filaments at the fourth repeat in a series of six tandem repeats , and Abp1p binds filaments at an actin - depolymerizing factor homology ( ADH ) region . Pan1p has not yet been shown to bind filaments , but the acidic region is insufficient for Arp2 / 3 complex activation . ( b ) Interactions with endocytic proteins . WASP proteins interact indirectly to dynamins by binding through their proline - rich domain ( P ) to syndapin , while cortactin and Abp1 bind dynamin directly at their SH3 domains . Pan1p contains an eps15 homology ( EH ) domain that interacts with several endocytic proteins including End3p , yAP1801 and yAP1802 . Despite their potential to play different cellular roles , one characteristic these three proteins appear to share with the WASP family is an ability to interact with endocytic pro - teins . Earlier studies had already implicated WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex in endocytosis . For example , a tem - perature - sensitive arp2 mutation in yeast confers defects in early internalization steps [ 1 ] , and neuronal - WASP ( N - WASP ) interacts with syndapin , another protein impli - cated in endocytosis [ 18 ] . Furthermore , T cells from WASP knockout mice show reduced levels of endocytosis [ 19 ] . The newly identified Arp2 / 3 activators also interact with endocytic proteins . Cortactin and mouse Abp1 were recently shown to bind to dynamins , which are GTPases involved in vesicle transport [ 20 , 21 ] . This binding is mediated by SH3 domains on cortactin and Abp1 which interact with a proline - rich region on dynamin ( Figure 1b ) . Further - more , Abp1 colocalizes with dynamin to sites of endocy - tosis in neurons , and overexpression of the Abp1 SH3 domain blocks the uptake of transferrin markers , indicat - ing the Abp1 – dynamin interaction is involved in endo - cytic processes [ 21 ] . The molecular function of dynamins is not known , but they are believed to be mechanoenzymes responsible for pinching off newly formed vesicles from the plasma mem - brane [ 22 ] . The discovery that dynamin interacts with nucleation - promoting proteins suggests that actin polymer - ization may also provide force in this process . Alterna - tively , dynamin may play a regulatory role rather than a mechanical role [ 22 ] , and actin polymerization might be solely responsible for force generation . As mentioned above , signaling molecules such as Cdc42 and PIP 2 are required to activate WASP proteins , and dynamins could play a similar role in activating cortactin and Abp1p . Unlike cortactin and Abp1p , Pan1p has not been found to interact with dynamins . However , Pan1p appears to be involved in vesicle formation , through its interactions with clathrin - associated proteins . Pan1p is the yeast homolog of the mammalian Eps15 , a protein associated with clathrin and the clathrin adaptor complex protein AP - 2 [ 23 ] . Although Pan1p does not bind clathrin directly , it does interact with yAP1801 and yAP1802 , two homologs of the clathrin assembly peptide AP180 which do bind to clathrin [ 23 , 24 ] . This interaction between Pan1p and clathrin - asso - ciated proteins is mediated through a conserved Eps15 homology ( EH ) domain , which defines this family of pro - teins ( Figure 1b ) . Pan1p has two EH domains , and they are believed to mediate protein – protein interactions required for endocytosis [ 23 ] . Indeed , Pan1p forms a complex with another EH domain - containing protein , End3p , which was isolated in a screen for endocytosis mutants [ 25 ] . As with cortactin and Abp1p , the importance of these interactions is not well understood . What conclusions can we draw from these recent studies ? The identification of Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulating proteins that interact with the endocytic proteins suggests a model in which actin polymerization provides the force behind plasma membrane invagination or the pinching off of endocytic vesicles ( Figure 2 ) . Alternatively , actin polymer - ization may be the driving force behind vesicle movement through the cytoplasm . In fact , endocytic vesicles have been shown to form actin tails similar to those of Listeria , and WASP is recruited to the surface of these vesicles [ 26 ] . It will be interesting to see if cortactin , Abp1p or Pan1p are associated with any of these vesicles . All three proteins may also play additional roles outside of endocytosis , where actin polymerization is required . In these cases , they may supplement SCAR / WASP - induced actin polymerization and provide finer control of actin dynamics and branching through their Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulating and branch - sta - bilizing activities . Future studies will focus more closely on disrupting the Arp2 / 3 complex - stimulating activity of these proteins and assessing its effects on endocytosis .
