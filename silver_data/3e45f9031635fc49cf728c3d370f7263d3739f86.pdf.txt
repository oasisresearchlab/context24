Introduction 22 Cells , tissues and organs are constantly affected by mechanical forces . Cells can sense 23 and convert mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals , a process known as 24 mechanotransduction . Forces applied to the cell surface deform the plasma membrane and are 25 quickly transmitted to the cytosol [ 1 ] . Several reviews have discussed the plasma membrane as a 26 mechanical barrier , contributing to cell shape and size , and orchestrating a variety of cell 27 functions [ 1 - 3 ] . 28 The notion of ‘membrane tension’ is widely used in cell biology to relate to cellular 29 phenomena that induce membrane shape changes . The tension within the membrane is generated 30 as a response to the application of an external force on the membrane surface . Membrane tension 31 develops within lipid bilayers and constitutes a structural basis of all biological membranes . 32 In the following sections , we highlight the major discoveries in the field , giving an 33 overview of the early experiments as well as the latest findings concerning how cells use 34 membrane tension to orchestrate cellular functions . We also propose future ideas for 35 investigations , with clear experimental directions , that could move the entire field forward . 36 37 2 . From theory of membrane mechanics to first experiments and basic principles in cells 38 In 1973 , Wolfgang Helfrich developed a model to describe the properties of lipid 39 membranes [ 4 ] . In this model , the elastic energy of a membrane depends on its tension ( σ ) , as 40 well as changes in membrane area ( Δ A ) , local curvature ( C ) and bending rigidity ( κ ) ( see Box 1 41 for more details ) . The tension in a lipid bilayer is defined as the force per unit length acting on a 42 cross - section of membrane . The membrane bending rigidity is a physical parameter that allows a 43 bilayer to resist a change in curvature . 44 45 2 . 1 . Methods to measure lipid bilayer mechanics in living cells 46 The first measurements of cell membrane mechanics were performed on erythrocytes 47 ( RBC ) in the 1970’s using Micropipette Aspiration ( MA ) and membrane tether pulling assays ; 48 the two most widely used techniques to measure lipid bilayer mechanics . Currently , not only MA 49 Page 4 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 4 but also atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and optical tweezers ( OT ) are being used to extract 50 membrane tethers and characterize the mechanics of cell membranes [ 5 ] ( Figure 1 ) . 51 52 2 . 1 . 1 . Micropipette aspiration and membrane tether pulling assays in non - adherent cells 53 MA is a suitable technique to measure the overall cellular tension , which is a 54 combination of membrane tension and the tension in the underlying actin cytoskeleton . It was 55 first used to measure the mechanical properties of RBCs [ 6 ] . A micropipette was brought in 56 contact with the cell membrane and a suction pressure was applied ( Figure 1 ) . Knowing the 57 amount of pressure needed to aspirate the cell , as well as the length of the cell membrane that 58 entered the pipette , the tension could be estimated [ 7 ] . However , the calculation for membrane 59 tension could only be performed if the aspirated portion remained small . If aspiration continued , 60 the tension would consequently change [ 8 ] . 61 The first membrane tether pulling assays were also performed in RBCs [ 9 ] ( Figure 1 ) . In 62 the so - called flow channel experiment , RBCs attached onto coverslips were subjected to fluid 63 shear stress . The cells deformed until the stress exceeded a critical point , after which RBCs 64 began to form tubes of membrane from the connection to their substrate . When the fluid shear 65 was reduced , the cells returned to their attachment points and the tubes disappeared [ 9 ] . An 66 improvement of the technique was later proposed [ 10 ] . On one side of a RBC , a portion of the 67 cell was aspirated into a small micropipette , and on the opposite side a latex bead ( held by 68 another micropipette ) was brought to the cell membrane and pulled to generate a tether . Using 69 membrane mechanics equations [ 11 ] , parameters could be determined ( Box 1 ) . Both the flow - 70 channel assay and the micropipete - based tether pulling assay can only be applied to non - adherent 71 cells , as these cells are relatively uniform in shape , unlike most adherent cells . 72 73 2 . 1 . 2 . Membrane tether pulling assays in adherent cells : optical tweezers and atomic force 74 microscopy 75 In order to measure membrane mechanical parameters in adherent cells , an OT - based 76 membrane tether pulling method was designed [ 12 ] . A coated bead trapped by OT is attached to 77 an adherent cell . The microscope stage is then set to move ( in the xy direction ) and the trapped - 78 bead position is recorded over time and converted into force after calibration ( Figure 1 ) . Based 79 Page 5 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 5 on the same basic principles , AFM coated cantilevers can also be used to pull tubes of cell 80 membrane [ 13 ] ( in the z direction ) . However as opposed to OT , AFM - based methods do not 81 always provide the optical capacity to observe tether formation . At the end of a force 82 measurement when the force that holds the membrane tube is released , it is critical to observe 83 whether this tube retracts back to the cell surface . This procedure ensures that no potential 84 perturbing element compromises the accuracy of the force measurements . 85 86 2 . 2 . Membrane tension in cells : influences of the cytoskeleton , membrane and 87 membrane - associated proteins 88 Using OT or AFM , tethers have been extracted from various cell types ( Table 1 ) . 89 However , these experiments have limitations because tether force and radius depend on 90 membrane tension and bending rigidity , thus measuring the force or radius individually does not 91 allow an absolute estimation of the membrane mechanical parameters . 92 Furthermore tethers carry information not only about the membrane itself ( in - plane 93 tension ) , but also about its attachment with the cortical cytoskeleton [ 14 ] . The plasma membrane 94 is associated with the cortex using numerous cross - linking proteins ( e . g . ezrin - radixin - moesin 95 ( ERM ) ) capable of binding to lipids ( e . g . PIP2 ) in the membrane [ 15 ] . The membrane tension of 96 a cell is thus a combination of both in - plane tension and membrane - cytoskeleton attachment . 97 But , which of these two components prevail in membrane tension determination ? Experimental 98 strategies capable of inducing membrane - cytoskeleton detachment , as well as specific changes in 99 cytoskeleton and / or membrane structures have been used to answer this question . 100 During bleb formation , a momentary separation between the plasma membrane and actin 101 occurs [ 16 ] . Tether - force measurements were performed in blebbing cells either on blebs lacking 102 cytoskeleton connection or on neighboring regions properly connected to the cytoskeleton [ 17 ] . 103 The results showed that membrane tension was ~ 4 times greater in areas where membrane was 104 connected to the cytoskeleton than that in blebs ( considered to have only in - plane tension ) . This 105 revealed membrane - cytoskeleton attachment as the major determinant in membrane tension [ 17 ] . 106 Tethers were also extracted from the surface of plasma membrane vesicles ( PMVs ) [ 18 ] . 107 PMVs are stable vesicles [ 19 ] formed upon cell exposure to reagents that weaken the membrane - 108 cytoskeleton connection [ 20 ] . The membrane tension values for PMVs were not significantly 109 Page 6 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 6 distinct among the different cells tested or from those found in blebs [ 17 , 18 ] . However , the 110 membrane tension values found for different cells were ~ 2 - 10 times greater than those found for 111 their respective PMVs [ 18 ] . These results demonstrate that the contribution of membrane - cortex 112 attachment to overall membrane tension determination are cell type dependent . Different cells 113 therefore have different mechanisms to maintain membrane tension homeostasis . These results 114 also confirm membrane – cytoskeleton attachment as a dominant factor in membrane tension 115 determination . 116 Modifications of specific cross - linking proteins can also induce changes in membrane 117 tension . Ezrin belongs to the ERM protein family , whose function is to link the membrane to the 118 actin cortex [ 21 ] . This protein linkage is controlled by switching between active 119 ( phosphorylated ) and inactive ( dephosphorylated ) states . Cells overexpressing phosphomimetic 120 ezrin mutants showed increased membrane tension and a lower propensity to form blebs [ 22 ] . 121 Cells overexpressing a non - phosphorylatable version [ 23 ] , treated with phospho - specific 122 inhibitors [ 24 ] or subjected to ezrin knockdown [ 24 ] showed in all cases a reduced membrane 123 tension . 124 Another example of cross - linking proteins are the class 1 myosins . These proteins belong 125 to the myosin superfamily [ 25 ] and interact with the membrane through their C - terminal tail 126 [ 26 ] . Thus , class 1 myosins serve not only as a cross - linker but also as a force generator between 127 actin filaments and the plasma membrane . Overexpression of myosins 1a , 1b , 1c , 1d or 1e all 128 lead to increases in membrane tension [ 27 ] whereas a reduction in myosin 1g expression leads to 129 a decrease in tension [ 28 ] . 130 Besides perturbing membrane - cytoskeleton attachment , researchers have also tried to 131 understand the contributions of cytoskeletal architecture and / or membrane composition to the 132 overall membrane tension determination . F - actin disruption , myosin light chain kinase inhibition , 133 Arp2 / 3 inhibition and cdc42 knockdown all reduce membrane tension [ 13 , 29 - 33 ] . Interestingly , 134 blebbistatin - induced myosin II inhibition has been observed to both decrease [ 31 , 32 ] and 135 increase membrane tension [ 34 - 36 ] . This discrepancy is discussed in the perspectives section , 136 together with a possible explanation for this dual effect ( see Figure 2 for more details ) . Changes 137 in membrane composition , particularly in cholesterol content , have also been shown to influence 138 cell mechanics [ 37 , 38 ] . Reducing plasma membrane cholesterol with methyl - beta cyclodextrin 139 Page 7 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 7 causes an increase in membrane tension in embryonic kidney cells [ 39 ] , fibroblasts [ 40 ] and 140 cardiomyocytes [ 41 ] . However , this increase is not only due to changes in membrane 141 composition , but also correlates with cytoskeletal rearrangements . Upon methyl - beta 142 cyclodextrin , fibroblasts showed de novo actin polymerization and Rho - GTPase dependent stress 143 fiber formation [ 40 ] whereas cardiomyocytes showed sarcomeric disorganization accompanied 144 by contraction abnormalities [ 41 ] . 145 Collectively , these results indicate that membrane tension has contributions from 146 membrane and cytoskeletal components as well as membrane - cortex attachment , in a cell 147 dependent manner . In - plane tension can also be affected by treatments that depolymerize actin or 148 lead to the formation of membrane blebs or PMVs because of the concomitant changes in 149 membrane composition . Clearly , the complete mechanism by which all those treatments leads to 150 changes in membrane tension requires further study . 151 152 2 . 3 . Experimental control of membrane tension in cells : osmotic shocks , cell stretching 153 and lipid incorporation . 154 Changes in cytoskeletal architecture , membrane composition and membrane - cytoskeleton 155 attachment are all correlated with changes in membrane tension . However , each modification 156 induces cells to adapt to their new condition and thus sets new membrane tension threshold 157 values . Due to this , researchers began to ask if there are ways to induce quick changes in 158 membrane tension that are fast enough to overcome the time for cell adaptation . 159 Osmotic perturbation was first proposed to induce these changes [ 42 ] . By changing the 160 medium from isotonic to 50 % hypotonic and then back to isotonic , cells swell followed by an 161 increase in membrane surface area . From isotonic to 50 % hypotonic conditions , the measured 162 tether force increased ~ 1 . 8 - fold . Assuming that membrane bending rigidity was kept constant 163 during the osmotic perturbation , a ~ 3 - fold increase in membrane tension during medium 164 exchange was estimated [ 42 ] . Although this approach is the most commonly used method to 165 manipulate membrane tension , osmolarity changes may induce other effects that are not directly 166 related to changes in tension . Particularly , great care must be taken to maintain critical ionic 167 concentrations ( e . g . calcium and magnesium ) to reduce side effects and undesirable signaling . 168 Moreover , because of the fast cell readaptation to osmolarity changes , effects at short time scale 169 Page 8 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 8 ( from seconds to few minutes ) must be analyzed . Different cell types may also respond 170 differently to hypo - osmotic shock , so that increases in membrane tension may not be similar . 171 Thus , it is crucial to measure the change in membrane tension ( associated with the change in 172 membrane tether force ) during a hypo - osmotic perturbation as an experimental control every 173 time a different cell type is used . 174 Alternatively , cell stretching can also provide some information on cell membrane 175 mechanics [ 13 , 43 ] . However , using this method , increases or decreases in membrane tension 176 may be an indirect result of modifications in membrane - cytoskeleton attachments and , as such , 177 must be carefully analyzed . 178 Changes in membrane tension can also be induced by adding substances that alter the 179 properties of the plasma membrane [ 44 , 45 ] . Deoxycholate and other lipid analogs have been 180 shown to reduce tension . These compounds , however , can trigger other cellular responses or 181 potential unwanted effects on the environment surrounding the cell , such as detergent - wetting 182 effect on certain substrates . 183 The above - described efforts have helped to better understand membrane tension 184 mechanics , however further investigations are still needed in order to understand the complete 185 mechanisms by which cells maintain their membrane tension values . More importantly , 186 researcher started to investigate how this physical parameter can directly regulate cell functions . 187 188 3 . Role of membrane tension in orchestrating cell functions : integration of this mechanical 189 parameter in the dynamic life of a cell 190 Membrane tension has been implicated in orchestrating endocytosis , exocytosis , 191 phagocytosis , migration and nucleus architecture . However , the presence of a membrane buffer 192 or reservoir challenges all conclusions and careful integration together with proper 193 spatiotemporal considerations are necessary ( i . e . some cellular phenomena affected by changes 194 in membrane tension can only be well observed without these reservoirs or only during reservoir 195 depletion conditions ) . 196 3 . 1 . Membrane buffer or reservoir 197 During tether extraction , membrane flows from the plasma membrane into the growing 198 tether and the force to generate the tether does not increase with tether length , at least for some 199 Page 9 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 9 micrometers . These observations have revealed the existence of a cell membrane reservoir 200 providing extra membrane to buffer rapid increases in tension [ 46 ] . However , after pulling the 201 tether many micrometers away from the cell , there is an abrupt rise in force and a consequent 202 increase in membrane tension , probably due to the depletion of all membrane reservoirs [ 46 ] . 203 Membrane reservoirs must be considered in many physiological behaviors [ 1 ] . Macrophages , for 204 example , present numerous folds on their surfaces that decrease after phagocytosis [ 33 , 47 ] . 205 Membrane - supported structures like lamellipodia and ruffles disappear upon a certain level of 206 membrane tension increase and seem to participate in membrane tension buffering , as 207 demonstrated recently using stretch - based experiments [ 43 ] . Endocytic structures or stabilized 208 invaginations like caveolae [ 48 ] , are also participating as potential membrane reservoirs . The 209 mechanical strength of the membrane ( i . e . before lytic rupture ) is far above the strength of most 210 of the molecular structures supporting membrane buffers and , as such , membrane tension will 211 ultimately be a leading physical signal . 212 3 . 2 . Membrane tension and endocytosis 213 It was first demonstrated that an increase in membrane tension of basophilic leukemia 214 cells by hypotonic swelling triggered a decrease in endocytosis . Once cells were returned to 215 isotonic medium , there was a quick drop in membrane tension followed by restoration of 216 endocytosis [ 49 ] . Moreover , during mitosis decreases in endocytosis have been reported [ 50 ] . 217 Aiming to understand if these decreases could be associated with changes in membrane tension , 218 tether forces of cells in interphase were compared with those during different mitotic phases 219 [ 45 ] . A ~ 2 - fold increase in tether force during prometaphase and a peak of ~ 3 - fold during 220 metaphase were measured . With progression to anaphase , tether force started to drop and finally 221 decreased after cytokinesis , to the same values as interphase . These findings [ 45 , 49 ] indicate 222 that a physical factor has important roles in controlling membrane traffic and in regulating cell 223 functions and open new avenues for subsequent studies . 224 The assembly of clathrin coats is sufficient to deform a membrane into a constricted pit , 225 without the force generated by actin polymerization [ 51 ] . However , cells treated with hypotonic 226 media stall their clathrin - induced membrane invaginations [ 52 ] and an extra force is required to 227 finish bending . The presence of Hip1R , a protein that links clathrin to actin , and the increased 228 number of actin filaments surrounding the pits were found to be sufficient to counterbalance the 229 increase in membrane tension to complete the endocytic process [ 52 ] . Supporting these findings , 230 Page 10 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 10 an in vitro study [ 53 ] demonstrated that clathrin binding can also be affected by changes in 231 membrane tension . Under low tension , clathrins form coats with extensive budding . Under 232 moderate tension clathrins form shallow pits . High tension completely inhibits clathrin binding 233 [ 53 ] . The polymerization of other protein coats has also been shown in vitro to depend on 234 membrane tension . COPI proteins change from a flat to budded state when tension is decreased 235 [ 54 ] . Increasing tension leads to disappearance of caveolae , while a decrease in tension induces 236 caveolae reappearance in an ATP - actin - dependent manner [ 48 ] . Thus , cells use their caveolae to 237 mitigate the effects of a sudden increase in tension , similar to the membrane reservoirs already 238 reported [ 45 ] . Moreover , increasing tension by cholesterol depletion also induces caveolae 239 disruption followed by other changes that culminate in sarcomeric disorganization and 240 contraction impairment in cardiomyocytes [ 41 ] . Similarly to caveolae , cells form blebs in 241 response to severe morphological changes like an abrupt cell detachment , suggesting that blebs 242 may also play a role in membrane homeostasis through regulation of membrane tension [ 55 ] . 243 244 3 . 3 . Membrane tension and exocytosis 245 During cell spreading , when membrane reservoirs are depleted , cell surface area is 246 increased through exocytosis of intracellular pool of vesicles containing 247 glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins [ 34 , 56 ] . At the same moment , there is a 248 sudden increase in membrane tension , which serves as a mechanical cue capable of triggering 249 this exocytic process [ 34 ] . 250 How could changes in membrane tension contribute to exocytosis ? It is known that 251 exocytosis can occur by two modes : ( 1 ) full - collapse fusion , where the vesicle completely fuses 252 to the plasma membrane and ( 2 ) kiss - and - run , where just a portion of the vesicle interacts with 253 the plasma membrane and a pore remains opened to release the content [ 57 ] . Modeling studies 254 have indicated that an optimal tension is required for complete vesicle fusion [ 58 , 59 ] . These 255 findings were confirmed experimentally in a cell - mimetic system where vesicles fusion occurs 256 when tension increases [ 60 ] . However , in these situations fusion occurs independently of the 257 cortical cytoskeleton . It has been shown , that in cells , the cortex and some actin - associated 258 proteins ( e . g . cdc42 and myosin II ) have important roles in controlling the increase in tension to 259 trigger vesicle fusion [ 32 , 61 ] . A dichotomy among membrane tension and exocytosis mode has 260 Page 11 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 11 been proposed , whereby high tension leads to full - collapse fusion while low tension leads to 261 kiss - and - run [ 32 , 62 ] . Accordingly , neurons , which frequently practice kiss - and - run exocytosis 262 [ 63 ] have low membrane tension [ 14 , 18 ] , while full - collapse fusion occurs in cells with higher 263 membrane tension , like fibroblasts and macrophages [ 18 , 30 , 33 ] . 264 265 3 . 4 . Membrane tension and phagocytosis 266 During phagocytosis , cells undergo dramatic changes in shape [ 64 ] . Since both 267 membrane and cytoskeleton remodeling have been described as being influenced by membrane 268 tension [ 34 , 44 ] , it is reasonable to think that changes in tension could also affect phagocytosis . 269 Using a frustrated phagocytosis system [ 65 ] , that simulates fibroblast cell spreading , it was 270 demonstrated that pseudopod extension occurs in two phases : the first is rapid , with actin 271 pushing the membrane forward using the membrane reservoirs to increase membrane area and 272 the second , which occurs once the membrane reservoirs are depleted and when membrane 273 tension increases [ 33 ] . This increase in tension alters activated Rac1 , 3´ - phosphoinositide and 274 actin distributions . Furthermore , it also induces exocytosis of vesicles containing GPI - anchored 275 proteins to continue membrane area expansion [ 33 ] . Thus , membrane tension acts as a 276 mechanical signal capable of orchestrating cell changes during phagocytosis . 277 278 3 . 5 . Membrane tension and the nucleus 279 When squeezing or stretching cells deform their nucleus , the applied force is distributed 280 through deformation of the nuclear lamina – the “molecular shock absorber” protecting the 281 nucleus from rupture [ 66 ] . A portion of this force is also transmitted to the nuclear membrane 282 which is able to increase its in - plane tension . Thus , the nuclear membrane tension can be defined 283 as the combination of both the in - plane tension within the nuclear membrane and its attachment 284 with the lamina . Direct measurements of nuclear membrane tension are not yet possible , due to 285 the difficulty in accessing the nucleus with beads or cantilevers to perform OT - or AFM - based 286 tether pulling assays . However , it has been demonstrated that the nuclear membrane is stretched 287 during various physiological conditions . For example , during cell migration through confined 288 channels , the nuclear membrane can eventually detach from the lamina and form blebs [ 67 , 68 ] , 289 process also associated with nuclear deformation and modification in genome integrity [ 69 ] . In 290 addition , nuclear membrane stretch can also be induced during nuclear swelling , which is a direct 291 Page 12 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 12 consequence of cell swelling , with the nuclear surface increasing up to 60 % [ 70 ] . Swelling - 292 induced nuclear membrane stretch activates the cytosolic phospholipase A2 and 5 - lipoxygenase , 293 both involved in cell signaling processes such as the inflammatory response [ 70 , 71 ] . Although 294 the mechanism behind this enormous increase in nuclear surface is still unknown , a possible 295 source of membrane is the endoplasmic reticulum . A membrane tension gradient possibly caused 296 by osmotic pressure differences between these two compartments , could enable membrane flow 297 from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus [ 72 ] . Further investigations are still needed 298 to elucidate this mechanism . 299 300 3 . 6 . Membrane tension and lamellipodial protrusion during 2D cell migration 301 In the early 2000’s , a study demonstrated that a rapid increase in tension ( by osmotic 302 perturbations ) decreased lamellipodial protrusion , whereas a decrease in tension ( using 303 deoxicholate and other lipid analogs ) stimulated protrusions [ 44 ] . However , this initial study 304 lacked high - resolution observations of real - time lamellipodial rearrangements during tension 305 changes . Studies which included these started in 2011 . 306 During fibroblast spreading there is a temporary increase in membrane tension which 307 correlates with depletion of membrane reservoirs used by the cell to increase its area [ 34 ] . 308 Moreover , following the actin dynamics by real - time high - resolution microscopy , it was possible 309 to observe that in the first moments of spreading , when the cell had ample membrane reservoirs , 310 the length of lamellipodial protrusion was exceptionally large . When reservoirs were completely 311 depleted and tension suddenly increased , lamellipodial protrusion length decreased . By 312 artificially changing tension with osmotic perturbation , an increase in tension was found to 313 decrease lamellipodial protrusions and reorganize the actin cytoskeleton , similarly to what occurs 314 during membrane reservoir depletion [ 34 ] . These results identified membrane tension as an 315 important orchestrator of the actin cytoskeleton remodeling in lamellipodia - based 2D cell 316 migration . 317 Caenorhabditis elegans sperm cells were also used to probe the influence of membrane 318 tension on their velocity and protrusion organization in 2D [ 73 ] . However , unlike fibroblasts [ 34 , 319 44 ] , decreases in tension inhibited cell movement , while increases in tension were associated 320 with increased cell speed [ 73 ] . This study proposed that an increase in membrane tension was 321 able to optimize C . elegans sperm cell motility by streamlining the polymerization of major 322 Page 13 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 13 sperm proteins in the direction of movement . However , as C . elegans sperm cell motility is 323 biochemically distinct from the fibroblast actin - based motility , one cannot claim that both 324 systems should behave in an analogous way . 325 Using neutrophils as a model for cell motility , it was also demonstrated that there was a 326 ~ 2 - fold increase in membrane tension when protrusion activity was stimulated [ 35 ] , similar to 327 previous observations in fibroblasts [ 34 ] . This increase in tension subsequently decreased 328 protrusions elsewhere through inhibition of Rac1 and SCAR / WAVE signaling [ 35 ] . Rac1 was 329 also shown to be inhibited in macrophages experiencing increased membrane tension during 330 phagocytosis [ 33 ] . The formin binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) also responds to changes in tension 331 [ 74 ] . An increase in tension detaches FBP17 from the membrane , preventing WASP / N - WASP 332 binding and subsequent Arp2 / 3 activation to power actin - based protrusions . In contrast , FBP17 333 re - attaches to the membrane and promotes protrusion formation when tension decreases [ 74 ] . In 334 conclusion , actin - based protrusions increase tension , which then acts as a direct long - range 335 inhibitor of actin assembly in a negative feedback circuit , inhibiting signaling molecules ( e . g . 336 Rac1 , SCAR / WAVE , FBP17 and WASP / N - WASP ) to prevent the formation of more 337 protrusions . A recent publication has reported an additional feedback mechanosensory cascade 338 which indirectly links membrane tension with actin protrusion . The authors found that an 339 increase in membrane tension acts through phospholipase D2 and the mammalian target of 340 rapamycin complex 2 to limit actin nucleation in neutrophils . In the absence of this pathway , 341 neutrophils exhibit large leading edges , increased membrane tension and chemotaxis problems 342 [ 13 ] . How phospholipase D2 “senses” membrane tension changes remain to be investigated . 343 Finally , another recent publication [ 75 ] has shown that during 2D cell migration , 344 membrane tension oscillates in cycles that are inversely correlated with lamellipodial protrusion . 345 During these cycles , when tension increases , the lamellipodium not only decreases in width but 346 also buckles upward in response to the barrier imposed by membrane tension against protrusion . 347 As tension decreases , protrusions resume and buckling disappears , until the next cycle . These 348 membrane tension cycles with periodical lamellipodial bucklings also induce adhesions to be 349 positioned in specific rows at the leading edge of the cell . The buckling occurs between the 350 previously positioned row at the base of the lamellipodium and a newly positioned row at the 351 extreme tip of the edge . Thus , the mechanical signal of membrane tension exerts an upstream 352 Page 14 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 14 control by periodically compressing and relaxing the lamellipodium , leading to the positioning of 353 adhesions during 2D cell migration [ 75 ] . 354 Therefore , lamellipodia seem extremely sensitive to changes in tension . Osmotic 355 perturbations have been shown to change their architecture [ 33 - 35 , 74 , 75 ] . Cell stretching , used 356 as an alternative method to increase membrane tension [ 13 ] , is also able to ablate the 357 lamellipodial network , but has mild or no effects on other structures , such as bundles and stress 358 fibers [ 43 , 75 ] . These findings reinforce that changes in tension dramatically affect 2D cell 359 migration . Further studies are needed but one biological model , the keratocyte 2D migration , has 360 already brought numerous information , as described below . 361 362 3 . 7 . Membrane tension and lamellipodial protrusion during 2D cell migration : lessons 363 from keratocytes 364 Fish keratocytes are among the fastest migrating cells . They have a flat fan - shaped 365 lamellipodium at their front and sides and a bulbous cell body at their rear , giving them a fast 366 migratory profile [ 76 - 78 ] . Thus , keratocytes are a great model to study lamellipodia - based 2D 367 cell motility . 368 It has been proposed that at the leading edge of keratocytes , membrane tension imposes 369 an opposing force on actin filaments that is constant per unit of edge length , so that the force per 370 filament is inversely proportional to filament density [ 79 ] . At the center of the leading edge , 371 filament density is higher so the force per filament would be smaller , allowing filaments to grow 372 rapidly and generate protrusion . As filament density gradually decreases towards the sides , the 373 force per filament would increase , eventually stalling polymerization . At the rear , membrane 374 tension is also important . Where the actin network disassembles , membrane tension would crush 375 the weakened actin network thereby retracting the cell rear [ 79 ] . A complement to this model 376 was later proposed [ 80 ] and experimentally tested [ 81 ] , suggesting that the disassembly of actin 377 filaments in the lamellipodium allows tension to crush the actin network at the rear of the cell . 378 The model proposes that tension , which is assumed to be spatially constant over the cell surface 379 [ 82 ] , is able to coordinate different processes in migrating keratocytes . 380 However , it was only in 2013 that membrane tension measurements were performed in 381 these cells [ 36 ] . OT - based tether extraction experiments together with measurements of tether 382 radii allowed the determination of both membrane tension and bending rigidity for migrating 383 Page 15 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 15 keratocytes . The authors of this study subsequently tested whether changes in the membrane and 384 the cytoskeleton could induce changes in keratocyte tension . By fusing large vesicles on the 385 surface of keratocytes , they increased membrane area by ~ 30 % , but found no changes in 386 membrane tension . However , the time interval between vesicle fusion and tether extractions was 387 significant ( ~ 10 minutes ) [ 36 ] . hence , tension may have initially dropped after vesicle fusion , but 388 was later restored to normal values when the measurements were performed . The authors also 389 extracted tethers from cytochalasin D - treated keratocytes as well as from blebs that appeared 390 during this treatment and found that tension values in blebbing regions were similar to the values 391 outside blebs , allowing them to conclude that the in - plane tension ( and not membrane - 392 cytoskeletal attachment ) was the main contributor to membrane tension determination in 393 keratocytes [ 36 ] . However , despite the fact that tension was similar in blebs and bleb - less regions 394 in cytochalasin - D treated keratocytes , both were almost ~ 3 times lower than tension in control 395 cells [ 36 ] . Therefore , it is likely that membrane - cytoskeletal attachment also plays an important 396 role in tension determination in keratocytes . Finally , the authors observed that the balance 397 between adhesions on the substrate and myosin - II activity were able to influence membrane 398 tension . While tension was directly correlated with adhesion strength , it was inversely correlated 399 with myosin contractility . Overall , this study presented a great set of experimental observations 400 highlighting the role of membrane tension as a physical variable that regulates keratocyte 401 migration . 402 It is assumed that under static conditions , membrane tension is isotropic and 403 homogeneous throughout the entire membrane [ 82 ] . However , tension distribution on moving 404 cells remains largely unexplored but is expected to show gradients along the membrane . A 405 theoretical model predicted the existence of such gradients [ 83 ] . By considering the actin 406 polymerization force against the membrane , the influence of adhesions spanning the membrane 407 and also of proteins anchoring the lamellipodial actin network to the membrane , the authors 408 predicted a ~ 50 % increase in membrane tension from front to rear of a migrating keratocyte . In a 409 subsequent study [ 84 ] , the same authors presented experimental observations of a front to rear 410 membrane tension gradient in migrating keratocytes ; but instead of a ~ 50 % increase [ 83 ] , the 411 experiments showed a ~ 30 % increase when comparing front to back [ 84 ] . This experimental 412 study presented the first set of results pointing to the existence of a membrane tension gradient 413 Page 16 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 16 between different regions of a cell . Further work will be required , not only to confirm , but also to 414 characterize other tension gradients in different motile cell types and conditions . 415 Membrane tension is known to counteract protrusion in keratocytes [ 79 , 81 ] . Thus , 416 tension increases should be correlate with decreases in lamellipodial protrusion and cell velocity . 417 However , it was found that the hypotonic treatment of keratocytes ( which should lead to an 418 increased membrane tension ) resulted in increased cell velocity and not in a reduced cell velocity 419 as expected [ 85 ] . A careful examination of these results , revealed two distinct temporal 420 responses . Indeed , several minutes after the hypotonic treatment , keratocytes appeared to have 421 compensated for the shock and the tension was likely restored to control levels as observed by 422 the authors . However , some seconds to a minute after the shock , a dramatic change in cell 423 morphology with a decrease in lamellipodial protrusion and cell velocity ( see Movie S2 in [ 85 ] 424 from 05 : 20 to 06 : 10 ) . It seems that keratocytes are responding to an osmotic perturbation on two 425 different scales . The immediate response ( < 1 min ) is correlated with an increase in membrane 426 tension followed by a decrease in lamellipodial protrusion and a decrease in migration speed . 427 Keratocytes then compensate the changes in medium osmolarity by readapting and continuing to 428 migrate . After readaptation , the new condition induces an increase in cell velocity by changes in 429 cell roundness and contact angles , as demonstrated [ 85 ] . 430 Although much work is still needed , all studies performed so far are great pieces of 431 evidence showing the importance of membrane tension in controlling 2D cell migration . 432 433 4 . Perspectives 434 Membrane tension integration as a fluctuating mechanical signal in complex biological 435 functions has just started to be investigated . In this section we are pointing out several directions 436 in which key discoveries may bring better understanding , and even some paradigm - shifts , as how 437 biological phenomena could be better understood . 438 439 4 . 1 . Membrane tension in 3D migration and tissue homeostasis 440 It is clear that membrane tension is implicated in cell motility as this has already been 441 studied by several groups and expertly reviewed in the past [ 86 , 87 ] . However , an important 442 biological question remains : how can membrane tension be investigated in vivo or at least in an 443 Page 17 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 17 in vivo - like situation , where cells are in 3D matrices or embedded in tissues ? It is already known 444 that cells use several ways to migrate in 3D environments [ 88 ] . Therefore , it would be relevant to 445 study the influence of membrane tension on 3D cell migration . For example , during migration on 446 fibronectin - coated nanofibers , an unusual organization of the leading edge is observed [ 89 ] . The 447 leading edges in fibers are extremely long ( up to 500 micrometers ) and rely on the formation of 448 actin waves that propagate at constant speed from the cell body towards the opposite end . These 449 waves extend the cell edge and allow cell translocation in a persistent and polarized manner [ 89 ] . 450 In a 2D situation , the molecules defining the leading edge are constrained to a region of a few 451 micrometers and the overall organization is well defined . At the opposite , on 3D suspended 452 fibers , the leading edge becomes extremely extended ( up to 500um ) and its organization needs to 453 be carefully evaluated . In particular , how the cells orchestrate their front - to - back polarity within 454 this extra - long leading edge is an important question . This orchestration may rely mostly on 455 mechanical signals coming from the plasma membrane ( i . e . membrane tension variations ) 456 ( Figure 3 ) . 457 One hypothesis is that the wave of actin pushing the plasma membrane could travel along 458 the entire cell length towards the leading edge at a constant membrane tension , and when it 459 arrives at the extreme tip of the leading edge , it would push the membrane , leading to an increase 460 in membrane tension due to membrane area depletion . This increase in tension could be the 461 mechanical signal sent by the leading edge to the cell body inducing the cell to convey more 462 membrane ( through exocytosis for example , as previously observed for fibroblasts and 463 macrophages ) , but also by increasing membrane availability through retraction . Once tension is 464 restored , the cell would be able to generate a new wave that could travel again towards the edge 465 for a new cycle ( Figure 3 ) . This theory of signaling is appealing because a physical cue , like 466 membrane tension , could travel faster and more accurately , from the cell edge to the cell body 467 than any diffusing biochemical signal or cytoskeletal remodeling . In fact , it has been proposed 468 that the role of tension could be analogous to that of the cell’s membrane potential in regulating 469 electrophysiological behaviors [ 86 ] . 470 471 4 . 2 . Converting a mechanical signal into biochemical responses 472 Page 18 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 18 A small number of studies have initiated the hunt to find which molecules could 473 transduce the mechanical signal of membrane tension into biochemical signals [ 13 , 33 , 75 ] . 474 Stretch activated ion channels are excellent candidates . 475 Best known in prokaryotes , they are present in eukaryotes and have been recently 476 reviewed [ 90 , 91 ] . The main challenge has been to decipher whereas the gating of these channels 477 is related to changes in in - plane tension or from adaptor molecules that indirectly transmit the 478 mechanical signal . For Piezo and MscS channels , evidences point toward a direct role of the in - 479 plane tension in their regulation . 480 Bar - domain containing proteins are also excellent candidates to link the mechanical 481 signal of membrane tension to the molecular cascades regulating contractility and protrusion ( i . e . 482 Rho signaling cascade upstream of formins ) . For example , in the C . elegans spermatheca , the 483 BAR domain - linked RhoGAP protein , SVP1 , is able to shuffle between the membrane and the 484 cytosol depending on the membrane tension of the spermatheca cells [ 92 ] . 485 When the egg penetrates in the spermatheca , cells are stretched and the plasma membrane 486 flattens . As a consequence , the BAR domain of SVP1 detaches , removing the membrane - bound 487 inhibitory effect on Rho - based contractility and allowing the cells to contract in response to the 488 stress induced by the entry of the egg . Similar mechanisms could occur in other situations within 489 different tissues ( Figure 3 ) . A comparable mechanism has been proposed for the BAR - domain 490 containing protein FBP17 during protrusion regulation in mammalian cells [ 74 ] . 491 492 4 . 3 . New experimental tools to measure membrane tension 493 In order to precisely determine membrane tension , it is best to measure tether force and 494 radius , since both membrane tension and bending rigidity are dependent on these two variables . 495 Tether force can be measured with OT or AFM . However , measurements of tether radii are 496 challenging as they are typically below the resolution limit of conventional microscopes . Thus , 497 most studies assume a standard value for the cell membrane bending rigidity ( ~ 0 . 3pN . µm ) [ 14 ] 498 and directly calculate membrane tension from measurements of tether force . The problem with 499 this assumption is that bending rigidity is also dependent on tether force and radius ( see equation 500 ( 6 ) in Box 1 ) . Moreover , bending rigidity also varies between different cell types [ 18 ] . To 501 address this , a correlative microscopy method has been proposed [ 30 ] . The idea is to extract a 502 tether and measure its force with OT and then measure its radius with scanning electron 503 Page 19 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 19 microscopy . However , these correlative experiments are difficult and the results are not simple to 504 obtain [ 18 ] . Furthermore , bending rigidity can also vary depending on the cell’s condition as well 505 as changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane [ 18 , 30 , 31 , 40 ] . Novel high - resolution live - 506 microscopy techniques capable of measuring simultaneously the tether radius and force are 507 critical to move the field forward . 508 Membrane tether pulling assays using OT or AFM have been the gold - standard methods 509 to measure membrane tension . However , to extract a tether , a probe ( bead for OT or cantilever 510 for AFM ) must be attached to the plasma membrane then an external force is applied to the 511 probe to pull it from the membrane . Could this force be inducing cell responses or momentary 512 changes in membrane tension ? Future studies proposing alternative methods to determine 513 membrane tension are needed . Recently , a non - invasive high - speed interferometric method to 514 detect membrane fluctuations has been developed [ 93 , 94 ] . With the advantage that the cell is not 515 physically manipulated during the measurement , this method seems a promising complement to 516 the existing techniques . 517 518 4 . 4 . Better integration of membrane tension in cellular responses : a case study with 519 myosin inhibition 520 Inhibiting myosin II with blebbistatin treatment triggers opposite effects on membrane 521 tension depending on the study , either decreasing [ 31 , 32 ] or increasing it [ 34 - 36 ] . This 522 discrepancy could be due to the fact that cells were not in the same state at the time of 523 measurement ( Figure 2 ) . Indeed blebbistatin induces a decrease in tension in static resting cells 524 [ 31 , 32 ] and an increase in tension in 2D spreading or migrating cells , which display large 525 lamellipodia [ 34 - 36 ] . In migrating cells , polymerizing actin filaments push the plasma membrane 526 forward increasing the force against it , while myosin filaments pull on these actin filaments 527 reducing the force against the plasma membrane . The balance between both events would 528 regulate the overall membrane tension value . Upon blebbistatin treatment , the myosin pulling 529 forces vanish and the force against the plasma membrane increases leading to greater membrane 530 tension . In static resting cells , blebbistatin could reduce the membrane tension because actin 531 bundles and stress fibers directly contribute to membrane tension and are more abundant in 532 control cells . The change in cell shape after blebbistatin treatment could also trigger a decrease in 533 membrane tension [ 31 , 95 ] . Although further studies are still necessary , this dual effect suggests 534 Page 20 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 20 that membrane tension is critical in fast moving / rapidly shape - changing cells and less important 535 in highly adhesive / non - migrating cells . 536 537 5 . Conclusions 538 Membrane tension is a dynamic physical parameter with a unique role as an orchestrator , 539 integrating inputs and feedbacks to regulate cell behavior . The importance of membrane tension 540 is now established , as tension has been measured in a variety of cells . However the complete 541 mechanism allowing cells to set and regulate their tension values is still unclear . Studies have 542 shown that tension regulation may vary not only between cell types , but may also depend on the 543 cell state at the time of measurement . A variety of cellular processes are already known to affect 544 tension , but how they all combine to determine and maintain tension threshold values is still a 545 mystery . 546 547 6 .

The tube is formed because membranes are under tension , trying 774 to reduce their surface area . Hypothetically , the minimum area would be reached when almost all 775 membrane retracted to its original configuration , leaving only an infinitesimally narrow tube . 776 However , this extremely thin tube cannot occur because as it shrinks , the curvature increases 777 until it reaches the bending rigidity’s limit . Therefore , the balance between membrane tension 778 and bending rigidity generates a tube with a given radius that is maintained by a certain force . 779 Thus , the same components described as contributors of the free energy of membranes 780 ( equation ( 1 ) ) can also be applied to tethers . Except for both ends of the tether , the rest of the 781 tube can be considered as a cylinder . So that , its curvature is considered as the inverse of its 782 radius , , and is . The free energy of a tether is given by [ 96 ] : 783 ( 2 ) 784 where is the force to hold a tether of length . 785 Minimizing the energy by the radius and length : 786 787 ( 3 ) 788 and : 789 790 ( 4 ) 791 combining both equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) : 792 σ A Δ C κ C R A Δ RL π 2 0 F L R L ; 2 2 dA C A E A  + Δ = κ σ ; 2 0 L F R L RL E tether − + = πκ σ π ; 2 σ κ = R ; 2 2 F 0 σκ π = Page 27 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 27 793 ( 5 ) 794 and : 795 ( 6 ) 796 ; 2 R F 0 π κ = .

I to II : Do we really have a 803 homogenous membrane tension distribution all over the cell surface during isotropic spreading ? 804 Particularly a difference in tension could exist between the basal membrane ( facing the substrate ) 805 and the apical membrane . III : During cell polarization and migration , do we have a homogenous 806 or heterogeneous tension distribution ? If it is heterogeneous , what are the time scales for 807 adaptation and transmission of tension over cell regions ? Upon blebbistatin - induced contractility 808 inhibition , several shapes are observed in cells : isotropic circular shapes ( IV ) , keratocyte - like C 809 shapes ( V ) and totally heterogeneous shapes ( VI ) . Since there is a debated effect on how 810 blebbistatin affects membrane tension , it is worth investigating how tension is distributed in each 811 of these different situations comparatively in order to draw a clearer picture . 812 813 Figure 3 : Open questions regarding membrane tension regulation during a 3D motility mode in 814 fibrous environment ( top panel ) , or during tissue mechanics ( bottom panel ) . 815 Page 29 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 29 Table 1 : Summary of tether force values found for different cell types and conditions . 816 Condition Tether Force ( pN ) Method References Cell type Neurons ~ 7 – chick dorsal root ganglion neurons ~ 15 – mouse cortical neurons ~ 32 – rat dorsal root ganglia neurons OT [ 12 ] [ 18 ] [ 97 ] Endothelial cells ( EA hy926 ) ~ 30 AFM [ 98 ] Chinese hamster ovary cells ( CHO ) ~ 30 AFM [ 98 ] Melanoma cells ( M2 and A7 ) ~ 30 OT [ 17 ] Neutrophil cells ( HL - 60 ) ~ 8 ~ 40 OT AFM [ 35 ] [ 13 ] Macrophages ( RAW 264 . 7 ) ~ 30 OT [ 33 ] Macrophages ( mouse peritoneum ) ~ 70 – control ~ 30 – LPS - activated OT [ 18 ] Fibroblasts ~ 30 – NIH3T3 / WTCL3 ~ 15 – MEFs OT [ 30 , 31 , 40 ] [ 56 ] Astrocytes and Glioblastoma cells ~ 30 OT / AFM [ 18 , 98 ] Page 30 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 30 Microglia ~ 60 – control ~ 40 – LPS - activated OT [ 18 ] Keratocytes ~ 55 ~ 40 OT [ 36 ] [ 85 ] C . elegans sperm cells ~ 35 OT [ 73 ] ERM modifications T Lymphocytes ~ 35 – control ~ 65 – ezrin phosphomimetic mutant OT [ 22 ] Kidney Epitelial cells ( MDCK II ) ~ 60 – control ~ 50 – neomycin ~ 45 – NSC668394 ~ 40 – ezrin siRNA AFM [ 24 ] Zebrafish prechordal plate cells ~ 30 – control ~ 20 – non - phosphorylatable ezrin isoform ~ 20 – combination of morpholinos against ezrin and moesin AFM [ 23 ] Myosin 1 modifications Epithelial cells ( NGI3 adenocarcinoma ) ~ 30 – control ~ 18 – Myo1a - TH1 mutant ~ 42 – Myo1A OT [ 27 ] Page 31 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 31 overexpression T Limphocytes ~ 45 – control ~ 25 – Myo1g KO OT [ 28 ] Cytoskeletal treatments Cythochalasin D NIH3T3 Fibroblasts ~ 30 – control ~ 18 – 5µM CytoD Rat dorsal root ganglia neurons ~ 32 – control ~ 22 – 10µM CytoD OT OT [ 30 , 31 ] [ 97 ] Latrunculin A RAW 264 . 7 Macrophages ~ 50 – control ~ 16 – 100nM Lat - A Rat dorsal root ganglia neurons ~ 32 – control ~ 22 – 10µM Lat - A OT OT [ 33 ] [ 97 ] Latrunculin B HL - 60 Neutrophils ~ 37 – control ~ 11 – 50nM Lat - B AFM [ 13 ] Arp 2 / 3 inhibition ( CK - 666 ) HL - 60 Neutrophils ~ 37 – control ~ 23 – 100µM CK - 666 AFM [ 13 ] Page 32 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 32 Myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) deletion Smooth Muscle cells ~ 145 – control ~ 95 – MLCK deletion OT [ 29 ] Cdc42 knockdown Pancreatic metastasis of a gut neuroendocrine tumor ( BON cells ) ~ 16 – control ~ 8 – cdc42 knockdown OT [ 32 ] Methyl - beta cyclodextrin treatments Fibroblasts ( WTCL3 ) ~ 30 – control ~ 45 – 10mM M β CD OT [ 40 ] Rat dorsal root ganglia neurons ~ 32 – control ~ 41 – 10mM M β CD OT [ 97 ] Human embryonic kidney cells ( HEK293 ) ~ 40 – control ~ 74 – 5mM M β CD OT [ 39 ] Cardiomyocytes ~ 35 – control ~ 55 – 10mM M β CD OT [ 41 ] Membrane - cytoskeleton detachment Blebs ~ 15 – melanoma cells ( M2 e A7 ) OT [ 17 ] Page 33 of 33 A c c ep t ed M anu sc r i p t 33 817 PMVs ~ 15 – mouse cortical neurons , astrocytes , microglia , peritoneal macrophages and human glioblastoma cells OT [ 18 ]
