[ 1 ] Despite the abundance of Fe on earth , iron deficiency ( ID ) and subsequently Iron Deficiency Anaemia ( IDA ) is the most prevalent anaemia worldwide ; with IDA being more common in developing counties . [ 1 , 2 ] Globally , 50 % of anaemia is caused by ID and results in 841 , 000 deaths annually . Of this figure , Africa and parts of Asia recorded 71 % of the global mortality burden ; whereas North America recorded 1 . 4 % of the total morbidity and mortality associated with IDA . In 2001 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) reported the prevalence of IDA among school aged children , in developed countries as 5 . 9 % . This was by far lesser than the prevalence of 48 . 1 % in developing countries . [ 3 ] ID is associated with some neurological disorders . Some persons with IDA feel a compulsion to move their lower extremities while at rest ( restless leg syndrome ) and this has been recognized as a reversible symptom of reduced brain Fe levels that is especially prevalent in pregnancy . Another associated neurological comorbidity is Pica ( or dietary compulsions for materials that may not usually be consumed in the diet of humans without ID . Geophagia , a type of Pica has been reported in a majority of pregnant African women living in regions where IDA is extremely common .

European Journal of Biomedical AND Pharmaceutical sciences http : / / www . ejbps . com ISSN 2349 - 8870 Volume : 5 Issue : 10 33 - 38 Year : 2018 * Corresponding Author : Ajuora Precious Ugochukwu Department of Medical Laboratory Science , Rivers State University , Npkolu , Port Harcourt , Nigeria . , ABSTRACT There has been promising applications of hepcidin in diagnostic medicine , but these are focused on adults . The diagnostic utility of hepcidin is limited due to the lack of standardization and absence of age - specific reference ranges in children . This study was aimed at determining reference values of hepcidin among healthy children in Umuahia , South - eastern Nigeria . A total of 150 apparently healthy children from 5 primary schools across Umuahia , aged 0 . 5 – 17 years were enrolled in this study , using a cross - sectional study design . Venous blood was obtained from the subjects and tested for serum hepcidin , serum ferritin , and the full blood count ( FBC ) . SPSS Windows version 20 was used for statistical analysis . The stochastic data were sorted into different age groups , gender , and times of blood sample collection ( before and after 12 : 00pm , i . e 12 : 00 to 17 : 00pm ) , expressed as Median , P2 . 5 , and P97 . 5 values of hepcidin concentration and hepcidin / Ft ratio . The Median , P2 . 5 , and P97 . 5 values were used to construct reference ranges for the various groups . The normality of the data was tested using histograms and the Shapiro - Wilk test . Hepcidin and ferritin concentrations showed skewed distributions , hence were log - transformed prior to analysis . The unpaired T test was used to evaluate differences between gender and times of blood sample collection . ANOVA was used to assess differences between the age groups and various parameters . Data were considered significant at . Results showed unique reference values for the hepcidin concentration ( 24 . 68 – 202 . 16 and the hepcidin : ferritin ratio ( 0 . 45 – 2 . 87 ) among all subjects in our setting . Reference values of hepcidin among male children ( 32 . 18 – 106 . 70 ) was significantly different from that of the females ( 21 . 21 – 177 . 62 ) ( p = . 02 ) . Reference values of hepcidin obtained among healthy children in Umuahia are unique from other setting . It is thus recommended that reference values of healthy children in other setting should not be used for diagnostic purpose in Umuahia . KEYWORDS : Hepcidin , ferritin , iron , children .

[ 3 ] Furthermore , IDA in children retards psychomotor development and impairs cognitive performance , increase morbidity from infectious diseases , and decrease work capacity . [ 3 , 4 ] Owing to the relevance of IDA in causing neurological damage during pregnancy and infancy , rapid diagnosis and subsequent aggressive treatment is expedient . [ 2 ] Diagnosis of IDA is through the detection and measurement of some cellular storage and transport proteins associated with Fe homeostasis . Ferritin ( Ft ) is the primary Fe storage protein and provides a reserve of Fe . It is comprised of an approximately spherical apoprotein shell with molecular weight of 480 , 000 , surrounding a core of ferric hydroxyphosphate of about 4 , 000 Fe atoms . [ 5 ] Binding of exogenous Ft to cell surface receptors have been implicated in Fe delivery pathway in the brain . [ 6 ] There has also been suggestions that serum ferritin is secreted by macrophages in response to changing Fe levels . [ 5 ] Fe exported to the serum is bound by the Fe transport protein , transferrin ( Tf ) . It is a glycoslylated Fe - binding protein , which is found in blood plasma , lymph , and other body fluids . Tf transports Fe to all cells . [ 7 ] It also keeps free Fe at a very low concentration ( about 10 - 18 M ) , which avoids the high potential risk of damage and deprives pathogens of Fe which they require for growth . [ 7 ] These transport proteins are sensitive to the recently discovered Fe regulatory hormone , hepcidin . Although , the contribution of dietary Fe sources to Fe homeostasis remains expedient , the discovery of hepcidin has immensely elucidated our knowledge of Fe balance and regulation . [ 1 ] Ferritin had been the central parameter for determination of significant ID as well as therapeutic response , [ 8 , 9 ] however , in situations of significant inflammation , serum ferritin levels may not reflect accurate Fe stores . [ 2 ] This is where the knowledge and efficient diagnosis of hepcidin comes in . Hepcidin is a small peptide of 20 – 25 amino acids ( aa ) with several isoforms released from a large prepropeptide of 84 aa . [ 5 ] It is a key regulator of Fe metabolism in chordates . [ 10 ] Hepcidin inhibits Fe transport by binding to the major Fe export protein , ferroportin ( FPN1 ) which is located on the basolateral surface of gut enterocytes and the plasma membrane of reticuloendothelial ( RE ) cells like macrophages . This process breaks down the transporter protein in the lysosomes . This inhibition of FPN1 prevents the export of Fe from the cells , and the Fe is hence sequestered in the cells . [ 10 , 11 ] This process prevents the influx of Fe into the hepatic portal system , via the enterocytes and , hence , reduces dietary Fe absorption . The reduction of Fe released from macrophages is also by the mechanism involving the inhibition of FPN1 . An example is anaemia of chronic inflammation seen in renal failure . [ 12 ] As shown in several studies , serum hepcidin levels are significantly associated with ID . [ 1 , 10 , 11 , 13 ] Thus , there is need to determine reliable reference ranges for hepcidin in children . Few studies have established reference ranges for hepcidin in children elsewhere , [ 14 , 15 ] but there is little or no documented study on determination of reference range of hepcidin among children in South - East , Nigeria . MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects , Design , and Setting The cross - sectional study design was employed in enrolling a total of 150 apparently healthy children who are residents of Umuahia . Subjects were aged between 0 . 5 to 17 years . 30 subjects were enrolled from each of the following primary schools : Amuzukwu Community Primary School , Umuahia , Amafor Isingwu Community School , Umuahia , Okwu Community Primary School , Olokoro , Mbonu Central School , Umuahia , and Umosu Community School , Ubaka . Children who did not submit written informed consent signed by their parents or guardian , with signs of ID , infection , or anaemia , and those older than 17 years were excluded from the study . Ethical approval to conduct this study was obtained from the ethical committee of the Federal Medical Centre , Umuahia and the Abia State Ministry of Education . Blood Sample Collection At least 2 ml of venous blood was collected into plain sterile evacuated tubes ( serum separator tubes ) , from each of the subjects and allowed to clot undisturbed for about 1 hour at room temperature as described by Jurry and associates . [ 16 ] Serum was obtained from the samples by centrifugation at 1200 × for 10 minutes . The supernatant serum was pipetted into another tube and centrifuged again at 1200 × for 10 minutes to obtain pure serum . This was followed by storage at - 20 o C pending analysis . Serum Ferritin Estimation Serum ferritin concentration was estimated using Human Ferritin Enzyme - linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) kit manufactured by Elabscience Biotechnology Inc . [ 17 ] The Ferritin assay is based on the Sandwich ELISA principle . Here , the micro ELISA plate supplied in this kit is pre - coated with an antibody that has specificity to human ferritin . The addition of either sample or standard to the micro ELISA well plates results in the formation of an antigen - antibody complex . This is then followed by the successive addition of a biotinylated detection antibody , specific to human ferritin , and avidin - horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) conjugate to each micro well plate , and subsequent incubation . Wells that contain human ferritin , biotinylated antibody , and avidin - horseradish peroxidase will give a blue colouration . This enzymatic reaction is then terminated by the addition of a stop solution that turns the whole preparation to yellow . The optical density ( OD ) of this solution is measured in a spectrophotometer at 450 nm . The OD of this solution is directly proportional to the concentration of human ferritin in the solution . [ 17 ] Ajuora et al . European Journal of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences www . ejbps . com 35 Estimation of Serum Hepcidin Serum hepcidin concentration was estimated using Human Hepcidiin 25 ( Hepc25 ) Enzyme - linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) kits manufactured by MyBioSource Inc . [ 18 ] This assay employs the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique . Antibody specific for Hepc25 has been pre - coated onto a microplate . Standards and samples are pipetted into the wells and any Hepc25 present is bound by the immobilized antibody . After removing any unbound substances , a biotin - conjugated antibody specific for Hepc25 is added to the wells . After washing , avidin conjugated Horseradish Peroxidase ( HRP ) is added to the wells . Following a wash to remove any unbound avidin - enzyme reagent , a substrate solution is added to the wells and colour develops in proportion to the amount of Hepc25 bound in the initial step . The colour development is stopped and the intensity of the colour is measured . [ 18 ] Statistical Analysis SPSS Windows version 20 [ 19 ] was used for statistical analysis . The stochastic data were sorted into different age groups , gender , and times of blood sample collection ( before and after 12 : 00pm , i . e 12 : 00 to 17 : 00pm ) , expressed as Median , P2 . 5 , and P97 . 5 values of hepcidin concentration and hepcidin / Ft ratio . The Median , P2 . 5 , and P97 . 5 values were used to construct reference ranges for the various groups . The normality of the data was tested using histograms and the Shapiro - Wilk test . Hepcidin and ferritin concentrations showed skewed distributions , hence were log - transformed prior to analysis . The unpaired T test was used to evaluate differences between gender and times of blood sample collection . ANOVA was used to assess differences between the age groups and various parameters . Data were considered significant at . RESULTS Table 1 : Demographic Information of Subjects .

DISCUSSION Haematological and iron parameters have been shown to vary significantly between populations . [ 20 ] Thus , there is need to determine population specific intervals for these parameters , in order to establish efficient therapy and monitoring of ID . This study was aimed at determining reference values of hepcidin in healthy children in Port Harcourt , South - South Nigeria . In order to achieve this , 150 apparently healthy children aged between 0 . 50 to 15 . 00 years were enrolled in the study . Subjects consisted of 89 ( 59 . 30 % ) males and 61 ( 40 . 70 % ) females whose parents or guardian gave written consent to the study ( Table 1 ) . From Table 2 , there was significant difference in the median hepcidin concentration between male and female children resident in Umuahia ( T = - 2 . 43 , p - value = . 02 ) . This result is similar to that obtained by Ganz and colleagues [ 21 ] in adult population , and the median values for male and female children in our study ( 81 . 60 and 66 . 70 , respectively ) were lesser than the median male but higher than the median female value in their study ( 112 and 65 , respectively ) . The difference in the age of the two populations may be the underlying factor for the different values ( theirs being an adult population ) . Our results show unique reference values of hepcidin concentration ( P2 . 5 – P97 . 5 : 32 . 18 – Ajuora et al . European Journal of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences www . ejbps . com 37 106 . 70 for males and 21 . 21 – 177 . 62 for females ) in apparently healthy children in Umuahia , South - eastern Nigeria . The median values ( Mdn : 78 . 35 , P2 . 5 – P97 . 5 : 24 . 68 – 202 . 16 , ) for hepcidin obtained in the total study population was higher than that obtained by Uijterschout and associates . [ 15 ] ( Mdn : 22 . 03 , P2 . 5 – P97 . 5 : 5 . 30 – 79 . 77 ) , for the immunochemical method used in their study . Contrary to the results obtained for hepcidin concentration , there was , however , no significant difference in the hepcidin ; ferritin ratio based on gender ( T = - 0 . 38 , p = . 70 ) ( Table 2 ) . This may be due to decreased iron storage and increased sequestration of iron in enterocytes or macrophages as seen in the similar values of median hepcidin : ferritin quotient in both gender that is > 1 ( 1 . 31 each ) . Our subjects were all apparently healthy . Tan and colleagues [ 22 ] showed in their study that a lower hepcidin : ferritin ratio is a potential biomarker for liver cirrhosis . In our comparison of median values of hepcidin concentration and hepcidin : ferritin ratio between children of various age groups ( Table 3 ) , we observed significant increase in values with increase in age . This is contrary to that obtained by Uijterschout and associates , [ 15 ] who showed a decrease in the median hepcidin concentration between 0 . 50 – 1 y and 1 – 3 y age groups among Dutch children . Also on the contrary , Uijterschout and associates [ 23 ] in their study in infants showed a progressive decrease in the median hepcidin concentration from week 1 to 4 months post - delivery . In this study , we established separate reference ranges for blood samples collected before 12 : 00 noon and after 12 : 00 noon , consistent with the blood sample collection routine in our setting . We observed that the values for each of hepcidin concentration ( P2 . 5 – P97 . 5 : 67 . 51 – 208 . 65 ) and hepcidin : ferritin ratio ( P2 . 5 – P97 . 5 : 0 . 92 – 2 . 92 ) of samples collected after 12 : 00 noon were significantly higher than those before ( Hepcidin : 21 . 59 – 91 . 63 , and hepcidin : ferritin ratio : 0 . 39 – 2 . 47 ) ( p = . 00 , Table 4 ) . This finding is consistent with that of several studies . [ 24 , 26 ] It has been observed that hepcidin expression seems to be under the regulation of circadian transcriptional factors like upstream stimulatory factor and c - Myc / Max via E - boxes of the Clock genes . [ 27 ] On the contrary , circadian oscillation in hepcidin concentration i i i i i i . This study has had its share of limitations . Few guardians consented to the participation of their children in this study . This caused a setback in the number of eligible samples collected for laboratory analysis . More so , longitudinal follow up on each subject to teenage age was not carried out due to limited time . This shall be done in a further research . CONCLUSIONS This study has obtained unique reference values for the hepcidin concentration among healthy children in Umuahia , Southeastern Nigeria . To the best of available literature , no previous study has established reference values for the hepcidin concentration in this study area . The study also showed different reference values of hepcidin for the male and female children .
