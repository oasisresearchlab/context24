Ettema 1 The origin of the eukaryotic cell remains one of the most contentious puzzles in modern biology . Recent studies have provided support for the emergence of the eukaryotic host cell from within the archaeal domain of life , but the identity and nature of the putative archaeal ancestor remain a subject of debate . Here we describe the discovery of ‘Lokiarchaeota’ , a novel candidate archaeal phylum , which forms a monophyletic group with eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses , and whose genomes encode an expanded repertoire of eukaryotic signature proteins that are suggestive of sophisticated membrane remodelling capabilities . Our results provide strong support for hypotheses in which the eukaryotic host evolved from a bona fide archaeon , and demonstrate that many components that underpin eukaryote - specific features were already present in that ancestor . This provided the host with a rich genomic ‘starter - kit’ to support the increase in the cellular and genomic complexity that is characteristic of eukaryotes . Cellular life is currently classified into three domains : Bacteria , Archaea and Eukarya . Whereas the cytological properties of Bacteria and Archaea are relatively simple , eukaryotes are character - ized by a high degree of cellular complexity , which is hard to reconcile given that most hypotheses assume a prokaryote - to - eukaryote trans - ition 1 , 2 . In this context , it seems particularly difficult to account for the suggested presence of the endomembrane system , the nuclear pores , the spliceosome , the ubiquitin protein degradation system , the RNAi machinery , the cytoskeletal motors and the phagocytotic machinery in the last eukaryotic common ancestor ( ref . 3 and references therein ) . Ever since the recognition of the archaeal domain of life by Carl Woese and co - workers 4 , 5 , Archaea have featured prominently in hypotheses for the origin of eukaryotes , as eukaryotes and Archaea represented sister lineages in Woese’s ‘universal tree’ 5 . The evolutionary link between Archaea and eukaryotes was further reinforced through stud - ies of the transcription machinery 6 and the first archaeal genomes 7 , revealing that many genes , including the core of the genetic informa - tion - processing machineries of Archaea , were more similar to those of eukaryotes 8 rather than to Bacteria . During the early stages of the genomic era , it also became apparent that eukaryotic genomes were chimaeric by nature 8 , 9 , comprising genes of both archaeal and bacterial origin , in addition to genes specific to eukaryotes . Yet , whereas many of the bacterial genes could be traced back to the alphaproteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria , the nature of the lineage from which the eukaryotic host evolved remained obscure 1 , 10 – 13 . This lineage might either descend from a common ancestor shared with Archaea ( follow - ing Woese’s classical three - domains - of - life tree 5 ) , or have emerged from within the archaeal domain ( so - called archaeal host or eocyte - like scenarios 1 , 14 – 17 ) . Recent phylogenetic analyses of universal protein data sets have provided increasing support for models in which eukaryotes emergeassistertoorfromwithinthearchaeal‘TACK’superphylum 18 – 22 , a clade originally comprising the archaeal phyla Thaumarchaeota , Aigarchaeota , Crenarchaeota and Korarchaeota 23 . In support of this relationship , comparative genomics analyses have revealed several eukaryotic signature proteins ( ESPs ) 24 in TACK lineages , including dis - tant archaeal homologues of actin 25 and tubulin 26 , archaeal cell division proteins related to the eukaryotic endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRT ) - III complex 27 , and several informa - tion - processing proteins involved in transcription and translation 2 , 17 , 23 . These findings suggest an archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes that might have been more complex than the archaeal lineages identified thus far 2 , 23 , 28 . Yet , the absence of missing links in the prokaryote - to - eukaryote transition currently precludes detailed predictions about the nature and timing of events that have driven the process of eukaryogenesis 1 , 2 , 17 , 28 . Here we describe the discovery of a new archaeal lineage related to the TACK superphylum that represents the nearest relative of eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses , and intriguingly , its genome encodes many eukaryote - specific features , providing a unique insight in the emergence of cellular complexity in eukaryotes . Genomic exploration of new TACK archaea While surveying microbial diversity in deep marine sediments influ - enced by hydrothermal activity from the Arctic Mid - Ocean Ridge , 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to uncultivated archaeal candidate lineageswereidentifiedinagravitycore ( GC14 ) sampledapproximately 15km north - northwest of the active venting site Loki’s Castle 29 at 3283m below sea level ( 73 . 763167N , 8 . 464000E ) ( Fig . 1a ) 30 , 31 . Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of these sequences , which comprised , 10 % of the obtained 16S reads , revealed that they belonged to the gammacladeoftheDeep - SeaArchaealGroup / MarineBenthicGroupB ( hereafter referred to as DSAG ) 31 – 33 ( Fig . 1b – d and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 ) , a clade proposed to be deeply - branching in the TACK superphylum 23 . DSAG constitutes one of the most abundantand widely distributed archaeal groups in the deep marine biosphere , but so far none of its representatives have been cultured or sequenced 31 . To obtain genomic information for this archaeal lineage , we applied deep metagenomic sequencing to the GC14 sediment sample , resulting in a smaller ( LCGC14 , 8 . 6Gbp ) and a larger , multiple - strand displace - ment amplified ( MDA ) metagenome data set ( LCGC14AMP , 56 . 6Gbp ; Fig . 2a ; Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Table 1 ) .

All rights reserved deeper coverage , the latter data set was used to extract marker genes that carry an evolutionary coherent phylogenetic signal ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ) . Using single gene phylogenies of these markers , contigs attributable to either one of the archaeal lineages present in the LCGC14AMP metagenome ( DSAG , DSAG - related , DPANN and Thaumarchaeota ) , couldbe extracted . These taxon - specific contigs were usedastrainingsetsforsupervisedbinningofcontigspresentinboththeLCGC14andLCGC14AMPmetagenomes ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . This approach resulted in the identification of two DSAG bins ( from LCGC14 and LCGC14AMP , respectively ) as well as one DSAG - related bin ( bin Loki2 / 3 from LCGC14AMP ) . We focused on the DSAG bin from the non - amplified data set to avoid potential biases introduced by MDA ( see Methods ) . The analyses of the low - abundant DSAG - related lineages were based on the MDA - amplified LCGC14AMP data set . After removal of small ( , 1kbp ) and low - coverage contigs ( Supple - mentaryFig . 5 ) , readsmappingtotheremainingDSAGbincontigswere reassembled into 504 contigs , yielding a 92 % complete , 1 . 4 fold - redund - ant composite genome ( ‘Lokiarchaeum’ ) of 5 . 1Mbp , which encodes 5 , 381 protein coding genes as well as single copies of the 16S and 23S rRNAgenes ( SupplementaryTable4andSupplementaryDiscussion1 ) . The DSAG - related bin ( Loki2 / 3 from LCGC14AMP ) was found to contain two low - abundant , distinct lineages , displaying slight but marked differences in GC content of 32 . 8 and 29 . 9 % , allowing for separation into two distinct groups ( Loki2 and Loki3 ) ( Supple - mentary Fig . 6 ) . Since these two lineages represent low - abundance community members , only partial genomes could be recovered . The Loki2 / 3 contigs did not contain 16S rRNA genes , rendering it imposs - ible to attribute them to any of the uncultured archaeal 16S phylotypes identified in the GC14 sediments , such as the low - abundance Marine Hydrothermal Vent Group archaea ( abundance , 0 . 05 % ; Fig . 1c ) . However , phylogenetic marker genes were extracted for these lineages aswell ( 21and 34 markersfor Loki2 and Loki3 , respectively ) since their inclusionwaspotentiallyusefulinresolvingthephylogeneticplacementoftheLokiarchaeumlineage . Lokiarchaeota and Eukarya are monophyletic To determine the phylogenetic affiliation of Lokiarchaeum and the Loki2 / Loki3 lineages , maximum - likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses were performed , using sophisticated models of molecular sequence evolution . By implementing relaxed assumptions of homogeneous amino acid composition across sites or across branches of the tree , these models are less sensitive to long - branch attraction and other phylogenetic artefacts . Both maximum - likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses of concatenated alignments compris - ing 36 conserved phylogenetic marker proteins 20 ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ) revealed that the DSAG and DSAG - related archaea ( hereafter referred to as ‘Lokiarchaeota’ ) represent a monophyletic , deeply branching clade of the TACK superphylum . Loki3 represented the deepest branch of the Lokiarchaeota , and Lokiarchaeum and Loki2 were inferred to be sister lineages with maximum support ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Intriguingly , when eukaryotes were included in our phylogenetic analyses , they were confidently positioned within the Lokiarchaeota ( posterior probability 5 1 ; bootstrap support 5 80 ; Fig . 2b ; Supplementary Figs 8 and 9 ) , as the sister group of the Loki3 lineage ( Fig . 2b ) . Robust assessment of these phylogenetic inferences ( Supplementary Figs 10 – 14 and Supplementary Table 5 ) revealed strong support for the Lokiarchaeota – Eukarya affiliation ( Supplementary Discussion 2 ) . The proposed naming of the Eukarya - affiliated candidate phylum LokiarchaeotaandtheLokiarchaeumlineageismadeinreferencetothesamplinglocation , Loki’s Castle 29 , which in turn was named after the Norse mythology’s shape - shifting deity Loki . Loki has been described as ‘‘a staggeringly complex , confusing , and ambivalent figure who has been the catalyst of countless unresolved scholarly controversies’’ 34 , in analogy to the ongoing debates on the origin of eukaryotes . Presence of diverse and abundant ESPs As our phylogenetic analyses strongly support a common ancestry of Lokiarchaeota and eukaryotes , we investigated the presence of putat - ive ESPs 24 in the composite Lokiarchaeum genome . The amount of genomic data obtained for the Loki2 / 3 lineages was too low to per - form detailed gene content analyses . A comparative taxonomic assessment of the Lokiarchaeum composite proteome revealed that a large fraction ( 32 % ) of its proteins displayed no significant similarity to any known protein , and that roughly as many proteins display highest similarity to archaeal and bacterial proteins ( 26 % and 29 % , c a 0 . 1 EU732030GQ926439 GU553490HQ700686 AY835411DQ363810 JQ327899 DSAG LCGC14GQ927648 GQ926464 JN123687 EU681933GQ927603JN123610 GQ927527 HM244045HM244070 HM480258 HM998486EU731915 EU731801DQ363819KC926811 EU731841 EU732042 90 90 100 AB177261 90 75 57 53 α β 2 β 1 γ d b A r c h aea l t a x a Taxon abundance A ll t a x a Gammaproteobacteria Alphaproteobacteria DSAG / MBG - B Bacteroidetes Candidate division OD1 Other bacteria Planctomycetes DHVEG - 6 Thaumarchaeota Unclassified Other archaea 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 6 18 18 1 5 5 77 56 15 9 3 2 1 DSAG / MBG - B DHVEG - 6 Thaumarchaeota MHVG Group C3 MBG - A 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 8 15 9 2 1 1 0 . 1 DSAG ( 10 . 0 / 75 . 0 ) Thaumarchaeota ( 1 . 2 / 8 . 9 ) Aigarchaeota ( 0 / 0 ) MCG + C3 ( 0 . 03 / 0 . 24 ) Crenarchaeota ( 0 / 0 ) T A C K MHVG ( 0 . 03 / 0 . 19 ) Korarchaeota ( 0 / 0 ) Euryarchaeota ( 0 / 0 ) DPANN ( 2 . 1 / 15 . 7 ) 89 97 75 100 Loki’sCastle GC14 550 m 3 , 500 m K n i p o v i c h R i d g e M o h n s R i d g e Figure 1 | Identification of a novel archaeal lineage . a , Bathymetric map of the sampling site ( GC14 ; red circle ) at the Arctic Mid - Ocean Spreading Ridge , located 15km from Loki’s Castle active vent site . b , 16S rRNA amplicon - based assessment of microbial diversity in GC14 .

All rights reserved respectively ; Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 15 ) , which is in accord - ance with recent findings that suggest major inter - domain gene exchange between Bacteria and Archaea 35 , 36 ( Supplementary Discussion 3 ) . Most notably , a significant part of the predicted proteome ( 175 proteins or 3 . 3 % ) was most similar to eukaryotic pro - teins ( Fig . 2c ) and revealed a dominance of proteins , which in eukar - yotes are involved in membrane deformation and cell shape formation processes , including phagocytosis 37 ( Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 6 ) . Several lines of evidence support that the presence of these proteins is not the result of potential contaminating eukaryotic sequence data . First , genes encoding Lokiarchaeum ESPs and other proteins most similar to eukaryotes were always flanked by prokaryotic genes ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) , and most were encoded by contigs that also contained archaeal signature genes . Second , ESP - encoding contigs displayed high ( . 20 3 ) read coverage , while eukar - yotic sequences could not be detected in the LCGC14 data set , and represented only a negligible fraction of the LCGC14AMP metagen - ome . Furthermore , the amplicon data generated with universal 16S / 18S primers did not reveal any 18S rRNA genes of eukaryotic origin ( Fig . 1b ) . Third , phylogenetic analyses of several Lokiarchaeal ESPs revealed their emergence at the base of eukaryotic clades ( see below ) , indicating that these proteins represent archaeal out - groups of the eukaryotic proteins rather than being truly eukaryotic in origin . Fourth , Lokiarchaeum appears to contain bona fide archaeal informa - tional processing machineries ( Supplementary Discussion 4 and Supplementary Tables 7 – 9 ) and , irrespective of the significant amount ofESPsinits genome , lacks manyother keyeukaryoticfeatures . Finally , we could also identify highly similar homologues of the Lokiarchaeal ESPs in a recent and independently generated marine sediment meta - genome derived from a sediment core sample off the Shimokita Peninsula of Japan , in which DSAG comprises a significant part of the microbial community 38 . As the function and evolution of the Lokiarchaeal ESPs hold relevance for understanding the origin of the eukaryoticcell , wereviewsomeofthekeyfindingsinmoredetailbelow . Potential dynamic actin cytoskeleton Actins represent key structural proteins of eukaryotic cells and com - prise filaments thatare crucial for various cellular processes , including cell division , motility , vesicle trafficking and phagocytosis 39 . The Lokiarchaeum genome encodes five actin homologues that display higher similarity to eukaryotic actins and actin - related proteins ( ARPs ) than to crenactins , a group of archaeal actin homologues that were recently shown to be involved in cell shape formation 25 , 37 , 40 ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . This observation was confirmed in a phylo - genetic analysis of the Lokiarchaeal actins that also included homo - logues identified in a recently published marine sediment metagenome 38 ( up to 99 % identity ) as well as in the LCGC14 and LCGC14AMP metagenomes ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 17 ) . Lokiarchaeal actins ( ‘Lokiactins’ ) comprise several distinct clusters , some of which branch at the base of distinctive eukaryotic actin and ARP clusters , albeit with weak support ( Fig . 3a ) . Despite the poor resolution of several deeper nodes in the actin tree , strong support is provided for a common ancestry of Lokiactins and eukaryotic actins , indicating that the proliferation of actins already occurred in the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes . Notably , the Lokiarchaeum gen - ome also encodes several hypothetical short proteins containing gel - solin - like domains that so far appear to be absent from bacterial and any other archaeal genomes ( Extended Data Table 1 , Supplementary Tables 6 and 10 and Supplementary Discussion 5 ) . In eukaryotes , these protein domains are part of the villin / gelsolin superfamily of proteins , which comprise various key regulators of actin filament assembly and disassembly 41 . Although the function of these hypothet - ical gelsolin - domain proteins remains to be elucidated , it is tempting to speculate that Lokiarchaeum has a dynamic actin cytoskeleton . Genomic expansion of small GTPases Small GTPases belonging to the Ras superfamily comprise one of the largestproteinfamilies in eukaryotes , wheretheyareinvolvedin various regulatory processes , including cytoskeleton remodelling , signal trans - duction , nucleocytoplasmic transport and vesicular trafficking 42 .

All rights reserved key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics , these small GTPases represent essential components for the process of phagocytosis in eukaryotes . Intriguingly , the analysis of Lokiarchaeal ESPs revealed a multitude of Ras - superfamily GTPases , comprising nearly 2 % of the Lokiarchaeal proteome ( Fig . 3b ) . The relative amount of small GTPases in the Lokiarchaeum genome is comparable to that observed in several unicellular eukaryotes , only being surpassed by the protist Naegleria gruberi . In contrast , bacterial and archaeal genomes encode only few , if any , small GTPase homologues of the Ras superfamily ( Fig . 3b ) . Phylogenetic analyses of the Lokiarchaeal small GTPases revealed that these represent several distinct clusters , each of which comprises several GTPase sequences ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 18 ) . Although phylogenetic analyses failed to resolve most of the deeper nodes , several of the eukaryotic small GTPase families appear to share a common ancestry with Lokiarchaeal GTPases ( Fig . 3c ) , suggesting an archaeal origin of specific subgroups of the eukaryotic small GTPases , followed by independent expansions in eukaryotes and Lokiarchaeota . This scenario contrasts with previous studies that have suggested that eukaryotic small GTPases were acquired from the alphaproteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria 37 . Although genes encoding canonical eukaryotic GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) were absent in Lokiarchaeota , twelve roadblock / LC7 - domain - containing proteins were identified ( Supplementary Tables 6 and 10 ) . While such proteins have been implicated in dynein organization in eukaryotes , roadblock / LC7 protein MglB of the bac - terium Myxococcus xanthus was shown to act as a GAP of the small GTPase MglA 43 . Hence , the Lokiarchaeal roadblock / LC7 proteins represent possible candidates for alternative GAPs in this archaeon . Presence of a primordial ESCRT complex In eukaryotes , the ESCRT machinery represents an essential com - ponent of the multivesicular endosome pathway for lysosomal degradation of damaged or superfluous proteins , and it plays a role in several budding processes including cytokinesis , autophagy and viral budding 44 . The ESCRT machinery generally consists of the ESCRT - I – III subcomplexes , as well as associated subunits 45 . The analysis of the Lokiarchaeum genome revealed the presence of an ESCRT gene cluster ( Fig . 4a ) , as well as of several additional pro - teins homologous to components of the eukaryotic multivesicular endosome pathway . For instance , Lokiarchaeum encodes divergent SNF7 domain proteins of the eukaryotic ESCRT - III complex , which appear to represent members of the Vps2 / Vps24 / Vps46 and Vps20 / Vps32 / Vps60 families , respectively . A phylogenetic analysis of the Lokiarchaeal SNF7 domain proteins revealed that these branch at the base of these two eukaryotic ESCRT - III families with low boot - strap support ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Fig . 19 ) , not only indi - cating that they might represent ancestral SNF7 copies , but also suggesting that the last eukaryotic common ancestor already inher - ited two divergent SNF7 - domain - encoding genes from its putative archaeal ancestor rather than a single gene 46 . Furthermore , the gene cluster encodes an ATPase that displays closest resemblance to eukaryotic VPS4 - type ATPases , including katanin , membrane scaf - fold protein ( MSP ) and spastin ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 20 ) as well as hypothetical proteins that show significant similarity 0 . 4 LCGC14AMP _ 05736710 Crenactin LCGC14AMP and Lokiarchaeum ( 4 / 1 ) Actin and related sequences Arp2 LCGC14AMP ( 5 ) Arp1 LCGC14AMP and Lokiarchaeum ( 11 / 1 ) LCGC14AMP / Lokiarchaeum ( 11 / 2 ) LCGC14AMP ( 2 ) Arp3 LCGC14AMP ( 2 ) LCGC14AMP _ 06532160 100 100 51 83 100 100 96 100 100 100 100 a c b 0 . 4 Euryarchaeota ( 13 ) Euryarchaeota ( 77 ) Lokiarchaeum ( 2 ) Bacteria and Euryarchaeota ( 19 ) Bacteria and Euryarchaeota ( 12 ) Bacteria ( 5 ) Lokiarchaeum ( 2 ) Lokiarchaeum ( 6 ) Euryarchaeota ( 5 ) Lokiarch _ 12880 Ran - family ( 7 ) Rho - family ( 7 ) Arf - family ( 7 ) Lokiarchaeum ( 2 ) Bacteria ( 46 ) Lokiarch _ 01230 Euryarchaeota ( 21 ) Lokiarch _ 37110 Lokiarchaeum ( 7 ) Lokiarchaeum ( 3 ) Ras - family ( 5 ) 170290521 Ca .

All rights reserved to EAP30 - domain - containing proteins ( Vps36 / 22 ) and Vps25 , respectively ( Fig . 4a ; Supplementary Figs 21 and 22 ) . In eukaryotes , Vps22 , Vps25 and Vps36 are components of the ESCRT - II com - plex , which comprises two to three of these proteins depending on the eukaryotic species 46 . In addition , a protein domain analysis of the Lokiarchaeum proteome identified a Vps28 - like protein , a com - ponent of the eukaryotic ESCRT - I subcomplex that links the ubi - quitin pathway to vesicular transport and which , apart from Vps28 , comprises Vps23 and Vps37 ( Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 23 ) . The different subunits of the eukaryotic ESCRT - I complex share similar two - helix core domains and have been suggested to have evolved from a single ancestral sequence 47 , which we now propose to be of archaeal origin . Finally , the Lokiarchaeum proteome was found to contain hypo - thetical proteins containing Longin - like domains , as well as several proteins belonging to the BAR / IMD superfamily ( Supplementary Tables 6 and 10 ) , comprising curvature sensing protein families involved in various aspects of vesicle / membrane trafficking or remodelling processes in eukaryotes . These findings suggest that Lokiarchaeum contains a primordial version of a eukaryotic ESCRT vesicle trafficking complex . In eukaryotes , ubiquitylation of target proteins represents a critical step in ESCRT - mediated protein degra - dation through the multivesicular endosome pathway 44 , 48 . The Lokiarchaeum genome contains a gene cluster that encodes several components required for a functional ubiquitin modifier system , including homologues for ubiquitin - activating enzyme E1 , ubiqui - tin - conjugating enzyme E2 , and 26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN11 . In addition , several hypothetical proteins with ubiquitin - like domains were identified in Lokiarchaeum , as well as diverse zinc - finger / RING - domain - containing proteins , some of which might serve as candidates for E3 ubiquitin protein ligases ( Supplementary Tables 6 and 10 ) . Several of these components have also been iden - tified in Aigarchaeota 49 . A ‘complex’ archaeal ancestor of Eukarya We have identified and characterized the genome of Lokiarchaeota , a novel , deeply rooting clade of the archaeal TACK superphylum , which in phylogenomic analyses of universal proteins forms a mono - phyletic group with eukaryotes . While the obtained phylogenomic resolution testifies to a deep archaeal ancestry of eukaryotes , the Lokiarchaeum genome content holds valuable clues about the nature of the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes , and about the process of eukar - yogenesis . Many of the ESPs previously identified in different TACK lineages are united in Lokiarchaeum , indicating that the patchy distribution of ESPs amongst archaea is most likely the result of lineage - specific losses 2 ( Fig . 5 ) . Moreover , the Lokiarchaeum genome significantly expands the total number of ESPs in Archaea , lending support to the observed phylogenetic affiliation of Lokiarchaeota and eukaryotes . Finally , and importantly , sequence - based functional pre - dictions for these new ESPs indicate a predominance of proteins that play pivotal roles in various membrane remodelling and vesicular trafficking processes in eukaryotes . It is also noteworthy that Lokiarchaeum appears to encode the most ‘eukaryotic - like’ ribosome identified in Archaea thus far ( Supplementary Discussion 4 ) , includ - ing a putative homologue of eukaryotic ribosomal protein L22e ( Fig . 5 ; Supplementary Fig . 24 and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 ) . Taken together , our dataindicatethatthearchaealancestorofeukar - yotes was even more complex than previously inferred 2 and allow us to 0 . 7 598854014 marine sediment metagenome 595075673 marine sediment metagenome Cren - / Thaum - / Aigarchaeota ( 59 ) Eukarya ( Vps2 ) ( 24 ) Eukarya ( Vps24 ) ( 18 ) LCGC14AMP _ 09186610 118346585 Tetrahymena thermophila LCGC14AMP _ 06982930 LCGC14AMP _ 10376800 Eukarya ( Vps46 ) ( 18 ) 604262720 marine sediment metagenome Eukarya ( Vps60 ) ( 8 ) LCGC14AMP _ 06867510 Eukarya ( Vps32 ) ( 13 ) LCGC14AMP _ 08445690 598763469 marine sediment metagenome LCGC14AMP _ 08417290 ( Loki2 / 3 ) 594999561 marine sediment metagenome 604350177 marine sediment metagenome LCGC14AMP _ 09264370 Eukarya ( Vps20 ) ( 11 ) LCGC14AMP _ 01505270 598791552 marine sediment metagenome 598849147 marine sediment metagenome Lokiarch _ 37480 ( Lokiarchaeum ) LCGC14AMP _ 06524000 Lokiarch _ 16760 ( Lokiarchaeum ) LCGC14AMP _ 08417280 ( Loki2 / 3 ) LCGC14AMP _ 09392100 90 75 97 100 92 93 71 63 100 59 96 61 58 100 86 100 96 100 59 96 93 92 0 . 3 595076476 marine sediment metagenome Euryarchaeal Vps4 ( group2 ) ( 15 ) LCGC14AMP _ 08445680 LCGC14AMP _ 06982940 604290277 marine sediment metagenome Eukarya ( katanin ) ( 6 ) 595008158 marine sediment metagenome Eukarya ( Vps4 ) ( 4 ) Eukarya ( MSP ) ( 4 ) LCGC14AMP _ 08417270 Cren - / thaum - / aigarchaeal Vps4 ( group 1 ) ( 31 ) 604295686 marine sediment metagenome LCGC14AMP _ 06821030 Eukarya ( spastin / fidgetin ) ( 6 ) Lokiarch _ 37470 ( Lokiarchaeum ) Archaeal Vps4 ( group 3 ) ( 4 ) 99 74 89 100 100 66 99 95 100 95 52 100 48 100 50 100 95 Lokiarchaeum EAP30 - domain a b c 7 . 5 kbp 8 kbp 8 . 5 kbp 9 kbp 9 . 5 kbp 10 kbp 10 . 5 kbp 11 kbp 11 . 5 kbp Vps20 / 32 / 60 29 kbp 29 . 5 kbp Vps25 - like 0 kbp 0 . 5 kbp 1 kbp 1 . 5 kbp 2 kbp 2 . 5 kbp 3 kbp 3 . 5 kbp 4 kbp Vps25 - like Vps4 Vps2 / 24 / 46 Vps4 Vps2 / 24 / 46 Vps20 / 32 / 60 EAP30 - domain Loki 2 / 3 Figure 4 | Identification of ESCRT components in the Lokiarchaeum genome . a , Schematic overview of ESCRT gene clusters identified in Loki - archaeum and Loki2 / 3 .

All rights reserved speculate on the timing and order of several key events in the process of eukaryogenesis . For example , the identification of archaeal genes involved in membrane remodelling and vesicular trafficking processes indicates that the emergence of cellular complexity was already under - way before the acquisition of the mitochondrial endosymbiont , which now appears to be a universal feature of all eukaryotes 28 , 37 , 50 . Indeed , based upon our results it seems plausible that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes had a dynamic actin cytoskeleton and potentially endo - and / or phagocytic capabilities , which would have facilitated the inva - gination of the mitochondrial progenitor . The present identification and genomic characterization of a novel archaeal group that shares a common ancestry with eukaryotes indi - cates that the gap between prokaryotes and eukaryotes might , to some extent , be a result of poor sampling of the existing archaeal diversity . Environmental surveys have revealed the existence of a plethora of uncultured archaeal lineages , and some of these likely represent even closer relatives of eukaryotes . Excitingly , the genomic exploration of these archaeal lineages has now come within reach . Such endeavours , combined with prospective studies focusing on uncovering metabolic , chemical and cell biological properties of these lineages , will uncover further details about the identity and nature of the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes , shedding new light on the evolutionary dark ages of the eukaryotic cell .

All rights reserved METHODS No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size . Sampling site and sample description . A 2 - m long gravity core ( GC14 ) was retrieved fromtheArctic Mid - Ocean Ridgeduring summer 2010 ( approximately 15km north - northwest of the active venting site Loki’s Castle ; 3283m below sea level ; 73 . 763167N , 8 . 464000E ) ( Fig . 1a ) . Samples for geochemistry and micro - biology were collected immediately and either processed on board or frozen for later analysis . Upon port arrival , the core was stored in sealed core liners at 4 u C ( core depository facility , University of Bergen , Norway ) . Comprehensive geo - chemical and microbial characteristics from this and adjacent sites have been described elsewhere 51 , 52 . The core consists of hemipelagic - glaciomarine sedi - ments receiving episodic hydrothermal input . The oxygen penetration depth wasestimatedto , 50cmbelowseafloor ( b . s . f . ) andthecontentoforganiccarbon varied between 0 . 6 - 1 . 3 % . While no measurable amountsof methane or sulphide could be measured , high and fluctuating levels of dissolved iron were detected . The relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers was estimated by quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) previously 52 , indicating high abund - ance of the DSAG in several of the investigated sediment horizons , especially at 75cm b . s . f . ( up to 40 % of the total prokaryotic population ; 2 . 7 3 10 6 copies per gram sediment ) . Thus , sample material from horizon at 75cmb . s . f . was used for all downstream analyses including amplicon and metagenome libraries . DNA extraction and genomic DNA amplification . To obtain sufficient amountsofgenomicDNAforsequencinglibrarypreparation , newsamplemater - ialwasobtainedfromthe75 - cm - b . s . f . layerofgravitycoreGC14insummer2013 . After qPCR - based verification of high DSAG abundance in the re - sampled material , DNA was extracted from 7 . 5g sediment using the FastDNA spin kit for soil in conjunction with the FastPrep - 24 instrument ( MP Biomedicals ) fol - lowing manufacturer’s protocol , except for the addition of polyadenosine as described in ref . 53 . The individual extractions were then pooled and concen - trated to a final volume of 50 m l using Amicon Ultra - 0 . 5 filters ( 50 . 000 NMWL ) following the manufacturer’s protocol ( Merck Millipore ) . Due to low yield and presence of inhibitors , 2 . 73ng of this genomic DNA was amplified using the REPLI - g ultrafast mini kit ( Qiagen ) according to the standard protocol for puri - fied genomic DNA . Amplicon sequencing and analysis of 16S rDNA phylogenetic analyses . To get a better estimate of the microbial diversity of Loki’s Castle sediment core LCGC14 , ‘universal’ primer pairs ( A519F ( 5 9 - CAGCMGCCGCGGTAA - 3 9 ) and U1391R ( 5 9 - ACGGGCGGTGWGTRC - 3 9 ) ) were used to amplify a , 900bp fragment of the 16S rRNA genes present in the non - amplified genomic community DNA ( extracted from LCGC14 , 75cmb . s . f . ) using the following conditions : 15min of heat activation of polymerase at 95 u C and 35 cycles of 95 u C ( 30s ) , 54 u C ( 45s ) , 72 u C ( 60s ) , followed by final extension at 72 u C for 7min . Qiagen HotStar Taq DNA polymerase was used for the PCR reactions . Subsequently , PCR products of the correct size were purified with Qiagen PCR purification kit , and quantified using a Nanodrop ND - 3300 fluorospectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) . Clean PCR products were then used as input materials for libraryconstructionusingTruSeqDNALTSamplePrepKit ( Illumina ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and applied to sequencing with an Illumina MiSeq instrument . The Illumina MiSeq run produced two 300 - bp paired - end reads . Raw MiSeq fastq sequences were treated with Trimmomatic tool ( v0 . 32 ) 54 using the following options : TRAILING : 20 , MINLEN : 235 and CROP : 235 , to remove trailing sequences below a phred quality score of 20 and to achieve uniformsequencelengthsfordownstreamclusteringprocesses . Remainingtraces of Illumina adaptor sequences were removed by SeqPrep ( https : / / github . com / jstjohn / SeqPrep ) and by BLAST 55 searches against NCBI Univec database . Quality - filtered MiSeq reads were checked for correct orientation of the 16S rRNA sequence in the paired - end reads and those containing the forward primer sequence ( A519F ) were extracted for OTU clustering with UPARSE pipeline 56 , setting a OTU cutoff threshold to 97 % . Chimeric sequences were filtered out by the Uchime tool 57 integrated in the UPARSE pipeline . Remaining chimeric sequences , if still present , were manually checked and removed . Abundances of each OTU were calculated by mapping the chimaera - filtered OTUs against the quality - filtered reads using the UPARSE pipeline . Using the mothur package ( v1 . 33 . 2 ) 58 , representative sequences for each OTU were aligned together with the Silva NR99 release - 115 59 alignment file to classify the OTUs . Phylogenetic analysis of archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences . Twenty - nine archaeal OTUs identified from the amplicon data were aligned together with 220 sequences representing the major clades in the archaeal 16S rRNA tree according to the study by Durbin and Teske 60 . A total of 249 sequences were aligned with MAFFT L - INS - i ( v7 . 012b ) 61 , trimmed with TrimAl ( v1 . 4 ) 62 , and subjected to a maximum - likelihood phylogeny analysis using RAxML ( v8 . 0 . 22 ) 63 ( GTRGAMMA model of nucleotide substitution and 100 bootstraps ) . The resulting tree was imported into iTOL online 64 to collapse major clades . Phylogenetic analysis of DSAG - related OTU’s . All 16S rRNA gene sequences classified as DSAG by Jørgensen et al . 52 were used as queries in a BLAST search ( E , 10 2 5 , identity . 83 % ) against all archaeal entries in the SILVA database ( release119 ) thatmetthefollowingcriteria : sequencelength . 900bp , alignment identity . 70 , alignment quality . 75 and pintail quality . 75 and the quality of recovered sequences was checked ( for example , using ‘cut - head’ and ‘cut - tail’ information ) . Thenumberofsequencesinthedatasetwasreducedwhilekeeping maximum diversity as follows . First , the retained 16S rRNA sequences were aligned with SINA ( v1 . 2 . 11 ) 65 , using all archaea in the SILVA database as ref - erence . The alignment was manually curated with Seaview ( v4 ) 66 . Upon removal of gaps , sequences were used to create OTUs with UCLUST ( v1 . 2 . 22 ) 67 ( 94 % identity cut - off and the ‘ – optimal’ option ) . All sequences that corresponded to OTU seeds were selected to represent full DSAG genetic diversity and , upon adding archaeal outgroup sequences and the single amplicon OTU , classified as DSAG , the final data set was aligned with SINA ( v1 . 2 . 11 ) as described above , trimmed with TrimAl ( v1 . 4 ) ( gap threshold of 50 % ) and subjected to RAxML phylogeneticanalyses ( v7 . 2 . 8 ; GTRGAMMAsubstitution model , 100rapid boot - straps ) . All internal branches with # 40 bootstrap support were collapsed with Newick - Utilities ( v1 . 6 ) 68 . TheresultingtreewasthenimportedintoiTOLonline 64 to collapse major clades . Metagenome sequencing and assembly . Library preparation and shotgun sequencing . Nextera libraries ( Illumina ) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions , using unamplified LCGC14 ( 20ng ) and amplified LCGC14AMP ( 50ng ) as input DNA . Since less starting material was used for the generation of the unamplified library , a total of eight amplification cycles were used in the PCR step during which the Illumina barcodesandadapters ( NextEraIndexkit ) werefused , ratherthanthedefaultfive cycles . The LCGC14 and LCGC14AMP NextEra libraries were sequenced with three and two lanes , respectively , of HiSeq2500 ( Illumina ) , using rapid mode setting , generating two 150 - bp paired reads . These runs yielded 8 . 6Gbp and 56 . 6Gbp of data with an average insert size of 620 and 350bp for the LCGC14 and LCGC14AMP NextEra libraries , respectively . Read preprocessing . SeqPrep ( v . b5efabc5f7 , https : / / github . com / jstjohn / SeqPrep ) was used to merge overlapping paired - end reads and to trim adapters , with default settings . Merged reads and non - merged pairs were trimmed with Sickle ( v . 1 . 210 , https : / / github . com / najoshi / sickle ) , using‘‘se’’and‘‘pe’’options , respect - ively , and default settings . Metagenomic assembly . Pre - processed paired - end reads and single reads were assembled with SPAdes v . 3 . 0 . 0 69 in single - cell mode , to take into account the widely varying coverage of metagenomics contigs as well as to try to assemble contigs with low coverage . The read correction tool was turned on and kmers 21 , 33 , 55 and 77 were used . Mismatch correction was not performed on the LCGC14AMP data set . Contigs shorter than 1kbp were discarded . Gene predictions . Protein coding genes ( CDS ) were identified with prodigal v . 2 . 60 70 , using the ‘meta’ option for metagenomes . Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) genes were called with rnammer v . 1 . 2 71 , using the archaeal model and searching for all three rRNA subunits . Transfer RNA genes ( tRNA ) were identified with tRNAscan - SE v . 1 . 23 72 , using the ‘ – G’ option for metagenomes and ‘ – A’ option for the Lokiarchaeum composite genome ( see subsequent paragraphs ) . For the latter , the analysis was also run with SPLITSX ( no version number available ; source code downloaded on 14 August 2014 ) 73 to detect tRNA genes that are split or that have multiple introns . Protein clustering . Archaea - specific clusters of orthologous genes ( arCOGs ) 74 , based on 120 archaeal proteomes ( hereafter called arCOGs2012 ) , were extended with proteomes from 45 recently sequenced organisms , including 31 single - cell amplifiedgenomes ( SAGs ) ( SupplementaryTable1 ) . First , existingarCOGswere attributed to the new proteomes : protein sequences in each of the 10 , 323 arCOGs2012 were aligned with MAFFT L - INS - i v . 7 . 130b 61 . Each alignment was used as a query ( - in _ msa ) to search the new proteomes using PSI - BLAST 55 , ignoring the master sequence , using 10 2 4 as an E - value cut - off , fixing the database size to 10 8 , gathering at most 1 , 000 sequences , and not using com - position - based statistics . Hits were then sorted per subject protein and , for each subject , the highest - scoring query alignment was deemed the main arCOG . Whenever applicable , the next - highest , non - overlapping query alignment was deemedthesecondaryarCOG . Second , proteins withoutarCOGattribution ( sin - gletons ) in both the original and extended set of proteomes were gathered , and new arCOGs ( arCOGs2014 ) were created from symmetrical best hits , using the tools available in COG software suite , release 201204 ( ref . 75 ) . PSI - BLAST searches were performed according to the COG software instructions . Lineage - specific expansions were identified with COGlse , using a job - description file containingall possible pairs of organisms that do not belongtothe same phylum . RESEARCH ARTICLE G 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved COGtriangles was run with default settings , and yielded 3 , 570 new arCOGs . Of the 325 , 405 proteins in the combined data sets ( 165 proteomes ) , 29 , 249 ( 9 % ) had no arCOG attribution . Attribution of arCOGs to metagenomes or composite genomes in this study was performed with PSI - BLAST as described above , using the arCOGs2014 as queries . Phylogenetic analyses of ‘taxonomic marker’ proteins for binning and con - catenated protein trees . Phylogenetic inference . Maximum - likelihood phylogenies were inferred with RAxML 8 . 0 . 9 63 , calculating 100 non - parametric bootstraps . PROTGAMMALG and GTRGAMMAwere used for amino acid and nucleotide alignments , respect - ively , unless otherwise stated . Bayesian inference phylogenies were calculated with PhyloBayes MPI 1 . 5a 76 , using the CAT model and a GTR substitution matrix . Four chains were run , and runs were checked for convergence . Whenever convergence was not reached , the topology of individual chains was compared . Consensustreeswereobtainedwithbpcomp , usingallfourchainsand a burn - in of at least half the generations . To add bootstrap support values to the Bayesian phylogenies , sumtrees . py ( DendroPy package 77 ) was used , with default settings , taking the Bayesian inference tree as a guide tree and the 100 bootstraps asinput . Forconcatenatedphylogenies , amino - acidsequenceswerealignedagain with MAFFT L - INS - i individually for each cluster . Positions with . 50 % gaps were trimmed and alignments were concatenated . Amino acid bias filtering . To assess the effect of amino acid bias on the phylo - genies , a x 2 filteringanalysiswasperformedontheconcatenatedalignment . Fora completedescription , seerefs78and79 . Inbrief , aglobal x 2 scoreiscalculatedfor theconcatenatedalignment , bysumming , foreachaminoacidandeachsequence , the normalized squared difference between the expected and observed frequency of the amino acid in this particular sequence and its frequency expected from the whole alignment . Each position in the alignment is individually trimmed and the difference ( D x 2 ) between the global x 2 score and the x 2 score calculated on the trimmed alignment provides an estimation of the relative contribution of each position to the global amino acid composition heterogeneity . Positions are then ranked bytheir D x 2 values , andthe mostor least biasedsites up to a thresholdare removed . Tree topology tests . To compare how well different trees explained the aligned sequence data , approximately unbiased tests 80 were performed on concatenated as well as single - gene alignments . Two maximum - likelihood hypothesis trees were tested against the alignments . The first one , showing Lokiarchaeota group - ing with eukaryotes , was obtained from the concatenation of 36 markers , shown in Fig . 2b . The second was obtained from the concatenation of the 21 ribosomal proteins present in the previous set , and shows Korarchaeota grouping with eukaryotes . For individual gene trees , the taxa missing in the alignment were also pruned from the hypothesis trees using the utility nw _ prune from the Newick Utilities package 68 . For each alignment tested , per - site maximum likelihood was calculatedforbothhypothesistreeswithRaxML8 . 0 . 9 , usingtheoption‘ – fG’ , and the PROTGAMMALG model . CONSEL 0 . 20 81 was then used to perform approximately unbiased tests , using default settings . Identification of taxonomic markers . A reference set of 59 highly conserved , low - orsingle - copy geneswereusedbothastaxonomicmarkersinthebinningprocess and for concatenated phylogenies ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Fifty - seven of these , which were shown to be prone to very few or no horizontal gene transfers were taken from ref . 79 . Two further arCOGs ( arCOG04256 and arCOG04267 , sub - units A 0 and A 9 of the DNA - directed RNA polymerase , respectively ) were added to the set ( see Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 2 for a list over which arCOG is included in each phylogeny ) . Unless otherwise stated , all trees included the same set of 101 reference gen - omes : 58 archaeal genomes selected 79 from the 120 analysed by Wolf et al . 74 ; 21 selected from the 45 newly sequenced organisms that were also used for cluster - ing , some of them already analysed in Guy et al . 82 ; two groups of three closely related SAGs were pooled to provide more complete proteomes ; ten bacteria and ten eukaryotes , as in Guy et al . 82 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . To remove paralogues and obtain sets with at most one homologue per genome , members of each of the selected arCOGs were aligned with MAFFT L - INS - i and a maximum - likelihood phylogeny was inferred with RAxML , under a PROTCATLG model with 100 slow bootstraps . Previously removed paralogues 79 were not included . Trees were then visually inspected and paralogues removed using the same guidelines as in ref . 79 . Thisset , includingatmostone copyof eachof the59referencearCOGs in 101 genomes , is hereafter referred to as ‘59ref’ . Binning . Training set . After arCOG attribution ( see above ) , genes from LCGC14AMP belonging to the respective arCOGs were added to the 59ref set . Sequences were aligned and individual trees were built for each arCOG , as described above . Trees were thenvisually inspectedand sequences from LCGC14AMP were classified in the following categories : Lokiarchaeum , Loki2 / 3 ( distant Lokiarchaeaum - related clades ) , Thaumarchaeota , DPANN , Diapherotrites , Mimivirus , Bacteria or unknown . Classification was based on phylogenetic placement . In some cases where the phylogenetic placementwas inconclusive , presence on the same contig of another gene already classified was used to aid classification . The fact that Lokiarchaeum is the only clade for which four to six distinct but closely related strains are present in LCGC14AMP greatly aided classification . In a minority of cases , some genes were classified in a category but marked as ‘putative’ , as their attribution was slightly ambiguous . Quality control of the training set . Contigs containing markers classified in the first six categories mentioned above were extracted from the assembly , and their tetranucleotidefrequencies ( TNF ) werecalculated . Tothenassessthereliabilityof the classification , linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) was performed in R 83 with package MASS 84 , using GC content and TNF as input data : half of the contigs belongingtoeachofthesixselectedcategorieswererandomlyselected ( excluding the contigs marked as ‘putative’ ) , and used to calculate LDA ( function ‘lda’ in MASS ) ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Based on this , classification was predicted using theMASSfunctionpredict . lda . Incorrectpredictions ( thatis , whentheprediction based on LDA was not congruent with the classification based on the phylogen - etic trees ) were recorded . The procedurewas repeated100times , and contigs that were attributed to the wrong category 30 times or more were manually reviewed and eventually discarded from the training set ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Contigs markedasputativewereattributedtothecategoryifthepredictionwascongruent with the putative classification 90 times or more , or discarded otherwise . A further cycle of LDA calculation and prediction was performed , with no contigs classified as ‘putative’ this time ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . To further investigate the robustness of the method , we randomized the categories of the input and performed the same LDA calculation and prediction as above , and assessed the number of incorrect predictions in each case ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . This test confirmed that classifications based on trees were generally congruent with pre - dictions based on LDA , significantly more often than just by chance ( Supplementary Fig . 4d – f ) . The final set of contigs was used as a training set for phymmBL 85 ( see below ) , and comprised 839kbp for Lokiarchaeum , 544kbp for Loki2 / 3 , 521kbp for Thaumarchaeota , 646kbp for DPANN , 43kbp for Diapherotrites and 21kbp for Mimivirus . Binning using PhymmBL . PhymmBL version 4 . 0 85 was run separately for binning the contigs larger than 1kbp from both LCGC14AMP and LCGC14 . As training sets , all prokaryotic genomes published in GenBank ( retrieved on 2014 - 03 - 04 , 2716 genomes ) were complemented with the 60 newly sequenced genomes used toconstitutethearCOGsetthatwasabsentfromGenBank ( SupplementaryTable 1 ) , and the six training sets ( Lokiarchaeum , Loki2 / 3 , Thaumarchaeota , DPANN , Diapherotrites and Mimivirus ) obtained from LCGC14AMP as described above . Reassembly of Lokiarchaeum bin . In the LCGC14 assembly , 3 , 165 contigs ( 18 . 6 Mbp in total ) were predicted to belong to the Lokiarchaeum genus , indicating a large degree of microdiversity . In order to reduce redundancy , contig sets were constituted , with increasing low - coverage cut - offs ( from 1 to 100 3 , with a 1 3 increment ) . The completeness and redundancy of each set was then estimated using the micomplete script ( manuscript in preparation ) . In brief , micomplete bases its predictions on the presence or absence of a set of single - copy pan - orthologs , in this case 162 markers defined in ref . 86 . To avoid overemphasizing the presence of markers that are often very close to each other ( for example , ribosomal proteins ) , each marker receives a weight coefficient based on the dis - tance between this marker and its closest neighbours both upstream and down - stream , averaged over a representative set of 70 Archaea ( set described in ref . 79 ) . Completenessisthefractionofweightedmarkerspresent , andisthusconstrained between 0 ( no marker present ) and 1 ( all markers present ) . Redundancy is cal - culated as the total number of copies of weighted markers present divided by the number of weighted markers present , and is thus always greater than one , where one would mean that all markers present are single copy . These two numbers were calculated for each contig set , and a cut - off of 24 3 represented the best compromise between completeness ( 0 . 89 ) and redundancy ( 1 . 67 ) ( Loki24 3 set , Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . To obtain a better assembly with longer contigs with only reads from Lokiarchaeum , reads belonging to Lokiarchaeum contigs were reassembled as follows . Reads from the LCGC14 data set , corrected by SPAdes , were mapped against the whole LCGC14 assembly with bwa - mem 87 , and reads that matched contigs in the Loki24 3 set were extracted . For paired - end reads , both reads were retained if at least one read matched the Loki24 3 set . These extracted reads were assembled with SPAdes as above , but without the single - cell mode and without read correction . Again , completeness and coverage were assessed for sets of con - tigs with increasing low - coverage cut - offs , and a threshold of 20 3 coverage was found to give the best compromise between completeness ( 0 . 92 ) and redundancy ( 1 . 44 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . The selected 504 contigs , hereafter referred to as ARTICLE RESEARCH G 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ‘Lokiarchaeum’ , represented 5 . 14Mbp of sequence . The N50 and N90 of this assembly were 15 . 4 and 5kbp , respectively . Annotation and contamination assessment of Lokiarchaeum genome bin . Annotation of all predicted open reading frames of the Lokiarchaeum genome binwasdoneusingprokka 88 , usingaconcatenationofthethreekingdom - specific protein databases shipped with prokka as the main database , predicting tRNA and rRNA as above . Furthermore , proteins were compared to sequences in NCBI’s non - redundant database and RefSeq using BLAST 55 and results were inspected using MEGAN 89 . Additionally , an InterProScan 5 90 ( which integrates a collection of protein signature databases such as BlastProDom , FPrintScan , HMMPIR , HMMPfam , HMMSmart , HMMTigr , ProfileScan , HAMAP , PatternScan , SuperFamily , SignalPHMM , TMHMM , HMMPanther , Gene3D , Phobius and Coils ) was performed and the genome was viewed and analysed in MAGE 91 . Selected genes of interest for the evolution of the eukaryotic cell and / or subjected to phylogenetic analyses were checked manually and annotated according to their protein domains / signatures based on PSI - BLAST 55 results , arCOG attributions ( Supplementary Tables 6 – 10 ) as well as protein structure predictions using Phyre2 92 . To check for the presence of particular genes of interest , such as specific eukaryotic ribosomal proteins , or eukaryotic ribosomal protein L41e which has been detected in several Euryarchaeota 93 , existing align - mentsfromarCOGsand / orKOGsweredownloadedfromeggNOG 94 andusedin PSI - BLAST searches as query against the Lokiarchaeal composite genome . Several controls were performed to confirm the absence of obvious contami - nants in the final Lokiarchaeum bin . Most importantly , all contigs containing ESPs discussed in the manuscript were manually inspected to verify that these actually belong to Lokiarchaeum , by : ( 1 ) inspecting neighbouring genes for the presence of archaeal markers ; ( 2 ) by querying all proteins present on contigs containing ESPs against the LCGC17 metagenome to check whether highly sim - ilar homologues could be found several times in the sample ( generally between 3 – 7copies ) accountingforthedifferent , highlyrelatedLokiarchaeotastrains ; and ( 3 ) by querying the same proteins against environmental metagenomes publicly available at NCBI , controlling that most of them had highly similar homologues in an ocean sediment metagenome 95 , but not in any other metagenome . This last check was based on our finding that all ESPs of Lokiarchaeum had highly similar homologues in this marine sediment metagenome ( for example , up to 98 % for Lokiactins ) indicating that closely related genomes of members of Lokiarchaeota are present , which is in accordance with the finding that DSAG represents an abundant group in these sub - seafloor sediments 96 . Finally , proteins comprising informational processing machineries were also investigated using MEGAN 89 . The absence of bacterial informational processing proteins indicated that there is no bacterial contamination in the final bin ( see Supplementary Discussion 3 ) . Identification of taxonomic markers in the bins . For Lokiarchaeum , arCOG attribution was performed as described above , and taxonomic markers were iden - tified by their arCOG attribution . Whenever there were two copies of the same marker , the copy located on the contig with the highest coverage was selected . For Loki2 / 3 , the category had two copies of 19 out of 36 markers present , with divergent phylogenetic placement . A clear GC content difference could also be observed between the copies , and , with a single exception , the two sets of copies were not overlapping ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The exception was discarded and the remaining two - copy markers were divided into two bins , Loki2 ( high GC , ranging between 32 . 2 – 37 . 3 % ) and Loki3 ( low GC , ranging between 27 . 7 – 30 . 7 % ) . Single - copymarkers witha GC contentfallinginto therangeof eitherof Loki2or Loki3 were attributed to the corresponding bin , the other copies were discarded . Loki2 ( high GC , average 32 . 8 % ) consisted of 21 markers and Loki3 ( low GC , average 29 . 9 % ) of 34 markers . Taxonomic affiliation of the Lokiarchaeum proteome . To estimate how Lokiarchaeum relates to its closest relatives , its proteome was aligned to NCBI’s non - redundant database using blastp , with an E threshold of 0 . 001 . To provide a way to compare results , the complete proteomes of ‘ Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum’ OPF8 , ‘ Candidatus Caldiarchaeum subterraneum’ and the incomplete proteome of SCGC AB - 539 - E09 , sole representative of the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal group ( MCG ) were similarly analysed . The results of the blasts were filtered to remove self - hits and hits to organisms belonging to the same phylum . In the case of the MCG representative , only self - hits were removed . Filtered results were then analysed with MEGAN 5 . 4 . 0 . Last common ancestor parameters were set as follows : Min Score , 50 ; Max Expected , 0 . 01 ; Top Percent , 5 ; Min Support , 1 ; Min Complexity , 0 . 0 . For each result , branches were uncollapsed at the level below super - kingdom . Profiles were compared using Absolute counts , and the results were exported and further analysed in R . Categories to which less than 100 hits were attributed in Lokiarchaeum were grouped under the ‘Other Archaea’ or ‘Other Bacteria’ categories . Hits to ‘root’ , viruses , unclassified sequences and hits not assigned were grouped under the ‘Other’ category . Results are shown in Fig . 2b . Using the same parameters , func - tional COGcategorieswere assigned to theLokiarchaeal proteome toget insights into the functional and taxonomic affiliation of the Lokiarchaeal proteome ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . Phylogenetic analyses of selected eukaryotic signature proteins ( ESPs ) . Selection of ESCRT - III homologues . For the ESCRT - III phylogeny , eukaryotic ESCRT - IIIhomologuesasdescribedinMakarova etal . 97 ( comprisingthefamilies Vps60 / Vps20 / Vps32 and Vps46 / 2 / 24 ) , as well as archaeal ESCRT - III homolo - gues belonging to arCOG00452 , arCOG00453 and arCOG00454 families present in Crenarchaeota , Thaumarchaeota and Aigarchaeota were extracted from GenBank . The more distantly related SNF7 - like arCOG families ( arCOG09747 , arCOG09749 and arCOG07402 ) 97 present in a few euryarchaeal species were not included in the alignment . Subsequently , respective arCOGs were retrieved from both the LCGC14AMP metagenome and Lokiarchaeum final bin ( see section on arCOG attribution ) . The ESCRT operon present on a Loki2 / 3 contig revealed the presence of an additional ESCRT - III homologue ( most similar to eukaryotic Vps20 / 32 / 60 sequences ) , which was not attributed to an archaeal COG . This homologue was used as an additional query to retrieve highly similar sequences from the LCGC14AMP metagenome as well as the Lokiarchaeum final bin using blastp . Finally , each of the two different SNF7 - family proteins , which are part of the ESCRT operons of Lokiarchaeum and Loki2 / 3 , respectively , were used as queries to search published metagenomes ( NCBI ) with blastp . Highly similar sequences ( coverage . 70 % ; identity . 40 % ) were retrieved and included in the phylogeny as well . Selection of Vps4 homologues . Archaeal sequences assigned to arCOG01307 ( cell division ATPase of the AAA 1 class , ESCRT system component ) as well as eukaryotic Vps4 homologues , including a few proteins of the cdc48 subfamily , were retrieved from GenBank . The latter protein family served as outgroup , as described in Makarova et al . 97 Sequences assigned to arCOG01307 were also extracted from LCGC14AMP metagenome as well as from the Lokiarchaeum bin , and sequences highly similar to the Vps4 of Lokiarchaeum were retrieved from published metagenomes ( coverage . 60 % ; identity . 50 % ) . The LCGC14AMP metagenome contained a large amount of sequences assigned to arCOG01307 , including hits to Vps4 homologues of Thaumarchaeota . However , ATPasesthat , based on phylogenetic analyses , turned out tobe unrelatedto Vps4 were removed from the analysis . Based on the initial phylogeny that included all of these sequences , only those LCGC14AMP Vps4 homologues that clustered with the Vps4 homologue of the Lokiarchaeum bin were selected to avoid the inclusion of false positives . Selection of EAP30 - domain ( Vps22 / 36 - like ) and Vps25 homologues . EAP30 and Vps25homologueshavesofarnotbeendetectedinArchaeaandthustherespect - ive sequences present in Lokiarchaeum ( Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 6 ) have not been assigned to an arCOG family . Thus , only Lokiarchaeum homologues , as well as selected representative eukaryotic sequences spanning the eukaryotic diversity that were retrieved from the GenBank database were included in these phylogenetic reconstructions . Putative EAP30 - and Vps25 - like homologues were discovered in the Lokiarchaeum genome since they are part of the ESCRT operon present on contig119 . These sequences were used as queries to also retrieve homologues from the LCGC14AMP metagenome ( E cut - off , 0 . 1 ; q coverage , 85 ) as well as from metagenomes deposited at NCBI . Selection of small GTPase family homologues ( IPR006689 and IPR001806 ) . The investigation of the Lokiarchaeum proteome revealed large numbers of proteins homologous to small GTPases of the Ras and Arf families . In order to reliably identify all putativesmall GTPasesin the Lokiarchaeum bin , an InterPro scan 90 , 98 was performed and all proteins assigned to IPR006689 ( Ras type of small GTPases ) and IPR001806 ( Arf / Sar type of small GTPases ) were extracted . Subsequently , archaeal reference sequences belonging to these IPR families were retrieved from GenBank . Eukaryotic and bacterial reference sequences were selected based on a previous study by Dong et al . 99 that investigated the phylo - geneticrelationshipsofmembersoftheRassuperfamily . Duetothelargenumber of GTPase homologues in the Lokiarchaeum bin , and the difficulty assigning these proteins to a particular taxon , it was decided not to analyse all GTPase homologues present in metagenomes . Upon inspection of the MAFFT L - INS - i alignment , partialsequencesandextremelydivergenthomologueswereremoved . Selection of actin homologues . So far , the only actin - related proteins detected in a few members of the archaea belong to arCOG05583 and have been referred to as crenactins 100 . Three proteins encoded by the Lokiarchaeum genome were assigned to this arCOG , and a blastp search against RefSeq revealed that these proteinsaremorecloselyrelatedtobonafideactinsofEukaryotesthantoarchaeal crenactins . In order to identify additional full - length actin homologues , blastp ( E - value cut - off , 10 2 10 ) searches were performed against the Lokiarchaeum genomeaswellastheLCGC14AMP metagenome , usingthisLokiarchaeumactin RESEARCH ARTICLE G 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved homologueasquery . Finally , a totaloffive and42full - length ( . 180amino acids ) actin - related proteins were retrieved from the Lokiarchaeum bin and from the LCGC14AMP metagenome , respectively . These sequences were merged with the archaeal protein sequences belonging to arCOG05583 as well as with major eukaryotic actin families ( actins and ARP1 – 3 ( refs 101 , 102 ) ) . We also assessed the phylogenetic position of the bacterial actin - related protein ( BARP ) of the bacterium Haliangiumochraceum 103 inlightofthenewLokiarchaealactinhomo - logues , and concluded that the Haliangium BARP was most likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes . Phylogenetic reconstructions . For all of these ESPs , the selected sequences were aligned using MAFFT L - INS - i 61 and trimmed with TrimAl 62 to retain only those columns present in at least 50 % ( for ESCRT - III ; Vps4 ; actin homologues ) , 40 % ( EAP30 - domain and Vps25 homologues ) and 80 % ( small GTPases ) of the sequences . Alignments were visually inspected and manually edited whenever necessary and subsequently subjected to maximum - likelihood phylogenetic ana - lyses using RAxML ( 8 . 0 . 22 , PROTGAMMALG ) with the slow bootstrap option ( 100 bootstraps ) .
