Adams 1 , 5 Blood vessels in the mammalian skeletal system control bone formation and support haematopoiesis by generating local niche environments . While a specialized capillary subtype , termed type H , has been recently shown to couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis in adolescent , adult and ageing mice , little is known about the formation of speciﬁc endothelial cell populations during early developmental endochondral bone formation . Here , we report that embryonic and early postnatal long bone contains a specialized endothelial cell subtype , termed type E , which strongly supports osteoblast lineage cells and later gives rise to other endothelial cell subpopulations . The differentiation and functional properties of bone endothelial cells require cell – matrix signalling interactions . Loss of endothelial integrin β 1 leads to endothelial cell differentiation defects and impaired postnatal bone growth , which is , in part , phenocopied by endothelial cell - speciﬁc laminin α 5 mutants . Our work outlines fundamental principles of vessel formation and endothelial cell differentiation in the developing skeletal system . The skeletal system grows rapidly in embryonic and postnatal life , which requires tightly coordinated cell proliferation , diﬀerentiation and mineralization processes 1 , 2 together with a substantial expansion of the local vasculature . Chondrocytes and bone - forming osteoblasts release vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and stimulate angiogenesis through the activation of VEGF receptors in endothelial cells ( ECs ) 3 – 6 . Likewise , bone repair involves angiogenesis and osteoblast precursors enter fracture lesions along with invading blood vessels 7 . In addition to their essential transport function , vascular ECs release paracrine - acting signalling factors that control growth and regeneration in various organs 8 – 12 . In the skeletal system , osteogenesis has been associated with a specific capillary EC subtype , termed type H , which shows high expression of the markers CD31 / PECAM1 and endomucin ( CD31 hi Emcn hi ) and is found in the metaphysis and endosteum of postnatal long bone 11 , 13 . In addition to mediating angiogenic growth , type H ECs provide molecular signals acting on osteoprogenitor cells and thereby couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis . By contrast , type L ( CD31 lo Emcn lo ) ECs , characterized by relatively low CD31 and Emcn expression , form the bone marrow sinusoidal vessel network and are not associated with osteoprogenitors expressing the transcription factor osterix ( Osx ) 11 , 13 . Interestingly , impairmentofthefunctionofbone - degrading osteoclasts by cathepsin K ( CTSK ) inhibitors , a treatment that might help to prevent bone loss in osteoporosis and other disease conditions , led to an increase of CD31 hi Emcn hi capillaries in mice , arguing that type H vessels might have therapeutic relevance 14 . Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) molecules promote mineralization and regulate the behaviour of osteoblasts and of bone - degrading osteoclasts 15 – 17 . Cell – matrix interactions are frequently mediated by integrin receptors , composed of α and β subunits , which can bind a wide range of ECM proteins but also soluble factors and cell surface proteins 18 , 19 . Integrin β 1 , a subunit that can partner with 12 diﬀerent α chains , is an important regulator of EC function . EC - specific inactivation of Itgb1 , the gene encoding β 1 integrin , is incompatible with embryonic angiogenesis and survival beyond midgestation 20 – 22 . Inducible genetic strategies have shown that integrin β 1 controls arteriolar lumen formation 23 as well as postnatal vessel growth and endothelial barrier function 24 . While these previous studies have focused on well - established models of embryonic and postnatal angiogenesis , insight into endothelial cell – matrix interactions in the developing skeletal system is lacking . In addition , it is not known how diﬀerent EC subtypes are 1 Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine , Department of Tissue Morphogenesis , and University of Münster , Faculty of Medicine , D - 48149 Münster , Germany . 2 Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine , Research Group Regulatory Genomics , D - 48149 Münster , Germany . 3 Institute of Physiological Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry and Cells - in - Motion Cluster of Excellence , University of Münster , D - 48149 Münster , Germany . 4 Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism , Institute for Nutritional Sciences , Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200031 , China . 5 Correspondence should be addressed to R .

RESULTS Developmental vascularization of long bone As reported previously 3 , 5 , 7 , 25 , vascularization of murine femur is initiated at embryonic day ( E ) 14 . 5 . In a process resembling sprouting angiogenesis ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , blood vessels entered the initially avascular cartilage containing hypertrophic chondrocytes and by E15 . 5 the primary ossification centre contained a highly branched vessel plexus ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Later , long bones expanded both longitudinally and radially , which was accompanied by expansion of the local vasculature ( Fig . 1b ) . From postnatal day ( P ) 6 onwards , morphologically distinct capillary populations became visible in the metaphysis and diaphysis ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Metaphyseal capillaries displayed a column - like structure 13 , while the diaphysis contained a dense sinusoidal network surrounded by haematopoietic cells ( Fig . 1c and 190 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Flow cytometry analysis of long bone showed that theEmcn hi CD31 hi ECfractionwashighestaroundbirthandgradually decreased during the first 4 weeks postnatally ( Fig . 1d ) . During the same period , Osx + cells expanded rapidly indicating bone growth ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Characterization of a third bone EC subpopulation Flow cytometry analyses using the same settings as established for P21 ( Fig . 1d ) revealed the existence of a third , previously not described subpopulation of bone ECs ( Fig . 2a ) . Emcn hi CD31 hi clusters from E16 . 5 , P6 and P14 femur were found in two distinct locations in two - dimensional plots and argued for a separate EC subset in addition to type H endothelium ( Fig . 2a ) . We termed this population type E because of its high abundance in embryonic long bone at E16 . 5 , while type H cells were comparably rare at this stage ( Fig . 2b ) . Type E EC abundance decreased postnatally to 3 . 8 % at P14 and 2 . 2 % at P28 , respectively . The fraction of type H ECs initially increased during early postnatal life , peaked at P6 and was already in decline at P14 . In accordance with the high abundance of sinusoidal ( type L ) endothelium in adult bone 13 , Emcn lo CD31 lo ECs increased continuously throughout all postnatal stages analysed and represented the major population after P6 ( Fig . 2b ) . To gain insight into their molecular properties , type H , E and L ECs were sorted by flow cytometry from P6 bones in triplicate . PrincipalcomponentanalysisofRNA - sequencingsamplesshowedlow variation within each sample group , while sample clustering indicated distinct profiles of individual EC populations ( Fig . 2c ) . Expression profiles of type E and H ECs were more similar to each other than to typeL . Diﬀerentialgeneexpressionanalysisforeverypossiblepairwise combination of samples , with a false discovery rate ( FDR ) - adjusted P value < 0 . 01 and an absolute log 2 fold change > 1 identified 3 , 324 diﬀerentially expressed genes for type H versus L , 4 , 602 for type E versus L , and 1 , 619 for type E versus H ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . A high proportion of genes ( 1 , 645 ) was upregulated in both E and H subtypes relative to type L cells , while 828 and 350 genes were specifically higher in type E and H , respectively ( Fig . 2e ) . RNA - sequencing results were confirmed by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription ( RT – qPCR ) for a panel of 14 genes . R 2 values of 0 . 98 for type H versus L , 0 . 93 for type E versus L , and 0 . 90 for type E versus H indicate high correlation of results ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . RNA - seq results for Emcn and Pecam1 confirmed enrichment of these markers intypeHandEECsrelativetotypeL ( Fig . 2f ) . Consistentwiththeflow cytometry data , type E cells showed higher Pecam1 and lower Emcn transcription than type H ECs ( Fig . 2a , f ) . Analysis of selected markers showed high expression of Vegfr2 / Kdr and Vegfr3 / Flt4 in type H and E ECs relative to type L endothelium ( Fig . 2g ) . Both genes encode VEGF receptors and regulate angiogen - esis in numerous settings 26 – 30 . Surprisingly , anti - VEGFR2 immunos - taining labelled column - shaped type H vessels less than the adjacent type L network ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . VEGFR3 protein was also low on type H columns , whereas the most distal type H vessels next to the growth plate and the sinusoidal network were strongly stained ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . As VEGF receptors undergo rapid turnover in the growing retinal vasculature 31 , mice were injected with the pro - teasome inhibitor MG132 , which limits the availability of ubiquitin and interferes with protein degradation 32 . MG132 led to elevated VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 staining of type H vessel columns , whereas changes in diaphyseal vessels were comparably modest ( Fig . 2h , i and Supplementary Fig . 2e , f ) . This validated the corresponding RNA - seq and RT – qPCR results and indicated high turnover and low steady - state levels of VEGF receptors in type H vessels . Functional properties of type E ECs Further analysis and validation of RNA - seq results enabled the iden - tification of markers that were expressed at high levels in type E en - dothelium relative to other EC subtypes , including Esm1 , Kitl , Unc5b , Bcam , Cav1 and Apln ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . In P6 femur , the type E - enriched markers caveolin 1 and BCAM / CD239 / Lutheran blood group glycoprotein , a specific receptor for laminin 511 in blood cells 33 , showed expression in Emcn - negative arterioles , which therefore did not correspond to type E ECs , as well as in Emcn + capillaries in compact bone and endosteum ( Fig . 3a – c ) . In E16 . 5 femur , most capil - laries were CD31 + ( Fig . 1c ) and a fraction also showed expression of caveolin 1 ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Cross - sections through P6 femur showed caveolin 1 + or BCAM + vessels in the endosteum and the adja - centcompactbone ( Fig . 3b , candSupplementaryFig . 3c ) . Interestingly , type E vessels were even more strongly associated with Osx + osteo - progenitors than type H capillaries ( Fig . 3c , d ) , which we attribute to high expression of bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) and of other factors controlling angiogenesis and osteogenesis ( Fig . 3e ) . When co - cultured with murine mesenchymal C3H10T1 / 2 cells 34 , freshly iso - lated type H or type E ECs induced remodelling of cell spheroids and expression of osteoblast lineage markers ( Fig . 3f , g and Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . In contrast , spheroids consisting of C3H10T1 / 2 cells and type L ECs lacked osteoblast lineage diﬀerentiation ( Fig . 3f , g and Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . As apelin ( encoded by the Apln gene ) was one of the markers enriched in type E ECs , we performed in vivo fate mapping with Apln - CreER knock - in mice 35 . Following a single administration of 4 - hydroxy tamoxifen ( 4 - OHT ) at E15 . 5 , Apln - CreER - induced expression of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) under control of the R26 - mT / mG Cre reporter 36 labelled ECs throughout the E16 . 5 and E18 . 5 femur , which predominantly represented type E endothelium ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . At P6 , GFP + ECs were highly abundant and had contributed to metaphyseal type H capillaries , type L sinusoids in the diaphysis and arteries ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Following 4 - OHT administration to Apln - CreER R26 - mT / mG newborn animals ( P0 ) , GFP + ECs were observed at P1 in type H capillaries near the growth plate and in endosteum and compact bone , that is , in sites enriched in type E endothelium ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . At P6 , GFP + ECs were highly abundant in arteries and all capillary subtypes ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Induction of Apln - CreER R26 - mT / mG animals with 4 - OHT at P6 showed that labelled ECs were initially concentrated in the distal metaphysis , endosteum and compact bone at P7 , whereas a substantial expansion of the GFP + endothelium into all capillary subtypes and arteries was seen at P11 , P15 and P21 ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Flow cytometry of P6 - injected Apln - CreER R26 - mT / mG bone ECs at P7 showed enrichment of type E ECs in the GFP + population , but in contrast to E16 . 5 , the fraction of type H ECs was substantially increased ( Fig . 4a , e ) .

Characteristic features of type E ECs are their strong association with Osx + cells and capacity to promote osteogenesis . Moreover , type E ECs can give rise to type H endothelium and both subtypes can dif - ferentiate into type L and arterial ECs during postnatal development .

In particular , RNA - seq and RT – qPCR data indicated high expression of Lama4 and , to a lower extent , Lama5 in type E and H ECs ( SupplementaryFig . 4d ) . Bothencodealphasubunitsofheterotrimeric laminins that are central constituents of the endothelial basement membrane and control cell behaviour 38 . By contrast , Fn1 transcripts ( encoding fibronectin ) were comparable in all three EC subtypes ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Transcripts for integrins were also enriched in type E and H ECs relative to type L ( Supplementary Fig . 4e – g ) . Accordingly , strong vascular staining was seen for laminin α 4 , laminin α 5 , fibronectin , and the integrin β 1 subunit in P6 or P21 femoral metaphysis ( Supplementary Fig . 4h – j ) . Anti - integrin β 1 staining also decorated the type L endothelium of the diaphysis , whereas the interstitial matrix proteins collagen type I and osteopontin labelled trabecular bone in the metaphysis ( Supplementary Fig . 4i , j ) . The phenotype of bone ECs is controlled by endothelial integrin β 1 To analyse integrin function in the endothelium of developing bone , Cdh5 ( PAC ) - CreERT2 transgenic animals 39 were interbred with mice carrying loxP - flanked alleles of Itgb1 40 . Cdh5 ( PAC ) - CreERT2 activity is strictly EC - specific at P21 ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) and all other stages investigated previously 13 . As tamoxifen administration during embryonic development led to rapid lethality of the resulting Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC mutants 24 , only postnatal mutants generated by tamoxifen injection from P10 – P12 were analysed . Eﬃcient Itgb1 inactivation was confirmed by RT – qPCR of freshly isolated bone ECs at P21 ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Three - week - old Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC mutants were smaller and had significantly lower body weight than control littermates ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . Freshly isolated mutant femurs were 9 % shorter than controls , displayed a dark red colour and contained a disorganized vasculature ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Fig . 5e , f ) . Type H vessel columns were much shorter , whereas the rest of the metaphyseal capillaries were highly branched and lacked a straight columnar organization ( Fig . 5b , c ) . VEGFR3 immunostaining , with the distinct low steady - state levels of the protein in type H EC columns ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , highlighted the loss of Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC columnar vessels ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Reflecting the reduced expansion of Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC long bone , the number of ECs was slightly but significantly increased despite reduced EC proliferation ( Fig . 5f , g ) . Arteries , which connect to type H capillaries in metaphysis and endosteum 13 , were present both in Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC and control femurs ( Supplementary Fig . 5g ) . Flow cytometry analysis of Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC femoral ECs showed an un - expected increase in CD31 hi Emcn hi cells ( Fig . 5h ) and immunohisto - chemistry showed strong CD31 signal in diaphyseal sinusoidal vessels ( Fig . 5i ) . Moreover , proliferation of mutant CD31 hi Emcn hi ECs was strongly reduced , whereas no significant change was seen in the type L subset ( Fig . 5j and Supplementary Fig . 5h , i ) . Flow cytometry analysis of Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC bone ECs indicated that the increase in CD31 hi Emcn hi cells was also in part attributable to expansion of the type E subset ( Fig . 5k ) . Together , this indicated that the loss of endothelial integrin β 1 leads to substantial phenotypic changes in bone ECs . Significantly more ECs showed elevated expression of the markers CD31 and Emcn butlacked thenormalmorphologicaland functionalpropertiesof type E or H endothelium . These changes were accompanied by alterations in regional metabolic properties . The non - hypoxic zone in the dis - tal metaphysis 13 was shortened , whereas phosphorylated mitogen - activatedproteinkinase ( phospho - Erk1 / 2 ) , amarkerofhighmetabolic activity , was decreased ( Supplementary Fig . 5j , k ) . Regulation of osteogenesis by endothelial integrin β 1 Bone angiogenesis and CD31 hi Emcn hi ECs are tightly coupled to osteogenesis 7 , 13 . Micro - computed tomography ( µ CT ) analysis of the P21 Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC tibial metaphysis uncovered profound structural defects in bone formation ( Fig . 6a ) . Mutants displayed significantly reduced bone volume , trabeculae number and trabecular thickness , whereas trabecular separation was increased . Connectivity density of trabecular bone was slightly but not significantly decreased ( Fig . 6a ) . Accordingly , the abundance of Osx + cells was strongly reduced in EC - specific Itgb1 mutants ( Fig . 6b , c ) . Osteocalcin , a marker for mature osteocytes , was also profoundly decreased in Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC mice ( Fig . 6d ) . Analysis of collagen type I and osteopontin , which are potential binding partners of integrin β 1 , revealed reduction of those proteins . Mutants displayed lower staining intensities than control samples and the length of trabecular segments was reduced , which was confirmed by visualization of matrix - rich structures by second - harmonic generation imaging using multi - photon microscopy ( Fig . 6e and Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) . Furthermore , immunostaining for the proteoglycan NG2 / Cspg4 and the transcription factor Runx2 , markers for primitive mesenchymal cells and preosteoblasts , respectively , was enhanced in Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC femurs relative to littermate controls , suggesting defective maturation of osteoblast progenitors ( Fig . 6f , g ) . Thus , postnatal loss of endothelial integrin β 1 leads to profound bone formation defects , which are presumably caused by loss of the pro - osteogenic properties of CD31 hi Emcn hi ECs and reduced expression of potential paracrine regulators 11 , 13 such as Pdgfb , Tgfb3 and Dll4 ( Fig . 6h ) . Arguing that bone defects are not caused by increased osteoclast activity , calcitonin receptor and TRAP ( tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ) staining was reduced in Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC bone sections ( Supplementary Fig . 6d , e ) . Serum levels of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin , hormones controlling bone remodelling , were not significantly changed ( Supplementary Fig . 6f ) . To address whether preferential gene inactivation in Emcn hi CD31 hi ECs would reproduce defects seen in pan - endothelial mutants , Apln - CreER and Itgb1 conditional mice were interbred . Administration of tamoxifen from P10 – P12 predominantly led to GFP expression in metaphyseal and endosteal type H ECs in Apln - CreER R26 - mT / mG animals at P13 , whereas no GFP signals were seen in the absence of tamoxifen ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – c ) . As shown above , the initially labelled EC population expanded substantially and , by P21 , GFP + cells were seen in arteries , veins and throughout the diﬀerent bone capillary networks ( Supplementary Fig . 7d ) . Apln - CreER - controlled Itgb1 i (cid:49) Apln mutantsgeneratedwiththe same scheme of tamoxifen administration showed disorganization of the metaphyseal vasculature , disruption of type H capillary columns and the appearance of ectopic interconnections , shortening of the vessel region with low VEGFR3 immunostaining , and increases in total and CD31 hi Emcn hi ECs with only minor changes in the type L subpopulation ( Fig . 7a – d ) . In addition to these vascular alterations , Itgb1 i (cid:49) Apln mutants also phenocopied the reduction in Osx + cells and osteopontin deposition , the increase in Runx2 preosteoblasts , and the 196 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Role of matrix molecules in the speciﬁcation of bone ECs Given the numerous important roles of matrix proteins in bone formation 15 – 17 , we wanted to identify ECM components interacting withendothelialintegrin β 1 . Globaldeletionof Lama4 didnotresultin any overt phenotype in P21 femur . Vascular organization was normal , the length of metaphyseal columnar vessels and Osx immunostaining were comparable to controls , and total and CD31 hi Emcn hi bone ECs were not altered ( Fig . 8a , b and Supplementary Fig . 8a – c ) . Osteopontin - deficient ( Spp1 KO ) mice had weak defects resembling certain aspects of the Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC phenotype . Metaphyseal vessel columns were shortened and branching between columns was increased , and Osx + cells and the VEGFR3 - low area within the metaphyseal vessel columns were slightly reduced ( Fig . 8c , d ; Supplementary Fig . 8d ) . However , the total number of ECs was not significantly changed and the CD31 hi Emcn hi subpopulation was decreased in Spp1 KO long bone ( Fig . 8e ) . As global Lama5 knockout mice are embryonic lethal 41 , bone from constitutive EC - specific Lama5 mutants 42 ( Lama5 (cid:49) EC ) was analysed , which showed defects resembling major aspects of Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC mutants even though the overall phenotype was comparably milder . Vessel columns near the Lama5 (cid:49) EC growth plate were shortened , branching within the metaphyseal vasculature was increased , and the VEGFR3 - low vessel area , Osx + cells and femur length were reduced ( Fig . 8f – h and Supplementary Fig . 8e – h ) . Mineralized bone , however , was not reduced significantly ( Supplementary Fig . 8i , j ) . While the total num - ber of Lama5 (cid:49) EC bone ECs was not substantially altered , the Emcn hi CD31 hi fraction was significantly increased ( Fig . 8i ) . The analysis of selected transcripts in freshly isolated ECs by RT – qPCR indicated strongly reduced expression of Lama5 and Itgb1 in the Lama5 (cid:49) EC bone endothelium ( Fig . 8j ) . Expression of Lama4 and Fgf1 was increased , while levels of Bmp2 and Dll4 were slightly but significantly decreased . These results indicate that disrupted cell – matrix interactions contribute , at least in part , to the defects in Itgb1 mutant bone . While it is likely that several ECM molecules are relevant in this context , our data argue for roles of osteopontin and the laminin α 5 subunit - containing laminin 511 or 521 isoforms , which are produced by ECs 43 and deposited in the subendothelial basement membrane . DISCUSSION ECsarehighlyheterogeneousintermsofgeneexpression , morphology and functional specialization 44 , 45 . While diﬀerences between arterial and venous or lymphatic and blood vessel ECs are widely recognized , much less is known about the existence and specification of distinct capillary subsets . In kidney , glomerular capillaries are part of the renal ultrafiltration system , whereas peritubular capillaries surrounding nephron tubules participate in ion and mineral reabsorption 46 , 47 . In adult brain , neurogenesis occurs in the adult subventricular zone and thehippocampalsubgranulezone , whichcontainneuralstemcellsand vessels that are morphologically and functionally distinct from other brain capillaries 48 , 49 . Specific properties of distinct capillary subtypes are perhaps best documented for the skeletal system . Type H capillary ECs support osteogenesis , whereas type L ECs form the sinusoidal vessel network of the bone marrow cavity 13 . However , the molecular signatures of the diﬀerent capillary EC subtypes and the processes controlling their specification have remained unknown . Our current study not only provides unbiased insight into the molecular properties of bone ECs but also establishes the existence of a third capillary EC subpopulation , termed type E , with high capacity to support perivascular Osx + osteoprogenitors in embryonic and early postnatal bone . While type E cells predominate in early long bone , genetic lineage tracing supports the existence of type E - to - H and type H - to - L conversion processes , which accompany the rapid developmental expansion of bone and bone marrow . On the basis of the sum of the findings presented here , we propose a developmental and functional hierarchy of bone ECs where type E cells occur upstream of type H and type L endothelium . Similar principles are likely to apply to other organsystemswhere , however , theidentity , localizationandfunctional roles of specific capillary EC subsets remain to be uncovered . ECM molecules and cell – matrix receptors were particularly enriched in the type E and type H gene expression profiles . Integrin family cell – matrix receptors are well known for their important roles in a wide range of cell diﬀerentiation processes 50 , 51 . Our data establish that the β 1 subunit is essential for the normal specification and function of bone EC subpopulations . In addition to matrix , integrins can bind and signal in response to growth factors and other secreted molecules 52 – 55 . However , Itgb1 i (cid:49) EC defects were partially phenocopied in Lama5 (cid:49) EC and , to a lesser extent , in Spp1 global knockout mice , which argues for a role of cell – matrix signalling in bone EC specification . A caveat of the genetic approaches in our study is that they aﬀect ECs throughout the body and might therefore potentially influence processes in the skeletal system indirectly . Nevertheless , the data presented here argue that integrin β 1 and laminin α 5 are required in bone ECs in a cell - autonomous and direct fashion . Thus , our findings raise thepossibility that changes inthe matrix environment of bone , which are the result of congenital defects and other pathological conditions in human patients 56 – 58 , might potentially lead to disease - promoting alterations in the vasculature . Our identification and characterization of distinct , functionally specialized capillary EC subsets might facilitate the characterization of disease - associated changes in the future .

For embryonic stages , females were checked for the presence of a vaginal plug in the morning . Lineage tracing experiments were performed by mating Apln - CreER mice 59 and R26 - mG / mT reporter animals 36 . Cre activity and GFP expression were induced by intraperitoneal injection of 4 - hydroxy tamoxifen ( 4 - OHT ) ( H7904 , Sigma ) . Induction was performed at E15 . 5 ( 750 µ g 4 - OHT per female ) , P0 ( 15 µ g 4 - OHT per pup ) and P6 ( 25 µ g 4 - OHT per pup ) . For postnatal analysis after embryonic induction , cesareansectionswereperformedatE19 . 5andpupswereraisedbyfoster mothers . As the Apln - CreER knock - in allele disrupts the function of the X - linked Apln gene 59 , only females were analysed . For inducible and EC - specific genetic experiments , Cdh5 ( PAC ) - Cre ERT2 transgenics 39 were interbred with mice carrying loxP - flanked Itgb1 ( Itgb1 lox / lox ) alleles 40 . Creactivityandgeneinactivationwereinducedbyintraperitonealinjection of 200 µ g tamoxifen ( T5648 , Sigma ) from postnatal day 10 to 12 . At the age of 3 weeks , femurs and tibiae were collected from Itgb1 lox / lox Cdh5 ( PAC ) - Cre ERT2 T / + mice and Cre - negative Itgb1 lox / lox littermate controls . The specificity of Cdh5 ( PAC ) - Cre ERT2 transgenic animals for ECs in long bone was determined by crossing Cdh5 ( PAC ) - Cre ERT2 mice with R26 - mT / mG 36 reporter mice . Cre activation was induced from P10 to P12 and mice were analysed at P21 . Furthermore , the Apln - CreER was introduced into the R26 - mT / mG reporter backgroundfortrackingof Apln + ECswiththesameinductionandanalysisscheme . For gene inactivation in Apln + ECs , Apln - CreER was bred into the Itgb1 lox / lox background . Gene inactivation was induced by tamoxifen administration from P10 to P12 ( 200 µ g per pup per day ) . Long bones were collected at the age of 3 weeks from Itgb1 lox / lox Apln - CreER T / + ( Itgb1 i (cid:49) Apln ) mice and Cre - negative Itgb1 lox / lox littermate controls . Furthermore , Itgb1 i (cid:49) Apln mice were interbred with R26 - mT / mG reporters . Theresulting Itgb1 lox / lox R26 - mT / mG lox / + Apln - CreER T / + and Itgb1 + / + R26 - mT / mG lox / + Apln - CreER T / + mice were analysed at 3 weeks of age after tamoxifen administration from P10 to P12 . The role of endothelial Lama5 was investigated by crossing mice carrying loxP - flanked Lama5 alleles 42 with Tek - Cre transgenics 60 . In addition , global Lama4 − / − 61 and Spp1 − / − knockout mice 62 were used . Genotypes of mice were determined by PCR . All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines , were approved by local animal ethics committees and were conducted at the University of Münster and the MPI for Molecular Biomedicine with permissions granted by the Landesamt für Natur , Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz ( LANUV ) of North Rhine - Westphalia . Animals were combined ingroupsforexperimentsirrespectiveoftheirsex . Apln - CreER knock - inmaleswere excludedfromanalysisbecausethesemicelackexpressionoftheX - linked Apln gene . The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment . Experiments were not randomized and no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size , which was , instead , chosen according to previous experiments . Proteasome inhibition , EdU labelling and hypoxia analysis . Three - week - old wild - type mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 µ gg − 1 MG132 ( Millipore , no . 474790 ) in dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ; Sigma , D8418 ) or with DMSO alone as a vehicle control . Three hours after injection , femurs were dissected and processed for immunostaining as described above . Proliferating cells in vivo were labelled by intraperitoneal injection of 500 µ g of EdU ( Invitrogen ) 2hbeforetheanalysis . Detectionofproliferatingcellsinfixedbone sections and in flow cytometry analysis was achieved with staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Invitrogen ) . Hypoxic cells were detected with the hypoxia probe pimonidazole ( Pimo , Hypoxyprobe Inc . ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Mice were intraperitoneally injected with 60mgkg − 1 Pimo 2h before analysis . Bone immunohistochemistry . Murine femurs and tibiae were dissected , cleaned from adjacent muscles , immediately transferred into cold 2 % paraformaldehyde solution and fixed overnight at 4 ◦ C under rotation . Next , bones were transferred into 0 . 5M EDTA solution and kept overnight at 4 ◦ C under rotation for decalcification . On the following day , EDTA was exchanged for 20 % sucrose and 1 % polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP ) solution . After 24h at 4 ◦ C under rotation , bones were embedded and frozen in 8 % gelatin ( porcine ) with 15 % sucrose and 1 . 5 % PVP . Finally , samples were cut into 100 µ m sections using low - profile blades on a Leica CM3050 cryostat . For immunofluorescence staining , sections were air - dried at room temperature , rehydrated in PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 for 15min at room temperature . After washing with PBS , blocking solution ( 5 % donkey serum + 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) was applied for 20min at room temperature . Following another PBS wash , sections were treated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 ◦ C . The next day , sections were washed four times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 . 5h at room temperature . After five wash steps with PBS , sections were mounted using FluoroMount - G ( Southern Biotech ) . Finally , coverslips were sealed with nail polish .
