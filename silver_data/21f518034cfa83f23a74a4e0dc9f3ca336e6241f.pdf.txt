Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) and Fer - CIP4 homology - BAR ( F - BAR ) proteins can induce membrane curvature and have been suggested to facilitate mem - brane invagination and scission . Two F - BAR proteins , Syp1 and Bzz1 , are found at budding yeast endocytic sites . Syp1 arrives early but departs from the endocytic site before formation of deep membrane invaginations and scission . Using genetic , spatiotempo - ral , and ultrastructural analyses , we demonstrate that Bzz1 , the heterodimeric BAR domain protein Rvs161 / 167 , actin polymeriza - tion , and the lipid phosphatase Sjl2 cooperate , each through a distinct mechanism , to induce membrane scission in yeast . Addition - ally , actin assembly and Rvs161 / 167 cooperate to drive formation of deep invaginations . Finally , we ﬁ nd that Bzz1 , acting at the invag - ination base , stabilizes endocytic sites and functions with Rvs161 / 167 , localized along the tubule , to achieve proper endocytic mem - brane geometry necessary for ef ﬁ cient scission . Together , our re - sults reveal that dynamic interplay between a lipid phosphatase , actin assembly , and membrane - sculpting proteins leads to proper membrane shaping , tubule stabilization , and scission . endocytosis | cytoskeleton | electron microscopy E ndocytosis involves a succession of plasma membrane remodeling steps ( 1 ) . First , the membrane is locally deformed to generate a shallow invagination , which is subsequently extended into a deep invagination . Next , the invagination neck constricts until a vesicle is pinched off . These dynamic membrane - remod - eling steps are achieved through temporally and spatially regulated protein - lipid and protein - protein interactions . Although numer - ous studies have documented activities of individual endocytic proteins in vitro and in vivo , the actual biological functions of these proteins can only be understood when the function of each protein is perturbed in vivo during endocytosis and the effects are analyzed dynamically and ultrastructurally . Real - time imaging and genetic studies in yeast suggested that the proteins and lipids involved in endocytic vesicle formation can be grouped into a coat module , a Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) protein module , an actin module , a phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] module , and a synaptojanin [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatase ] module ( 2 – 5 ) . Importantly , although a wealth of information about biochemical activities , dynamics , and spatial organization of the key molecular players in endocytosis has ac - cumulated , a coherent view of how the various proteins mediate membrane remodeling steps is only now beginning to emerge . In addition to coat proteins , several other proteins help to shape endocytic membranes and pinch off vesicles . For example , from yeast to mammals , banana - shaped dimeric BAR and F - BAR proteins bind preferentially to curved membranes and induce membrane curvature . The BAR domain protein amphiphysin functions with dynamin and actin during membrane tubulation and scission in mammalian cells ( 6 , 7 ) , and it preferentially binds to negatively charged lipids , such as phosphatidyl serine and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 8 ) . Because F - BAR domain proteins generally bind to membranes of lower curvature relative to BAR domain proteins ( 9 – 12 ) , it has been suggested that they might associate with the base of the invagination ( 13 ) . In budding yeast , two F - BAR pro - teins , Syp1 ( 14 ) and Bzz1 , and the heterodimeric BAR protein Rvs161 / 167 are recruited to endocytic sites with distinct timing , suggesting distinct functions in membrane remodeling , and evi - dence supports the conclusion that Bzz1 and Rvs161 / 167 localize at the invagination base and along the tubule , respectively ( 4 , 15 ) . Actin assembly is integrally linked to endocytic membrane in - vagination in yeast and in mammalian cells ( 5 , 7 , 15 – 22 ) . Whether the actin cytoskeleton has speci ﬁ c functions in membrane scission is not clear . Because disruption of actin assembly in yeast blocks membrane invagination ( 5 ) , new strategies are needed to test for actin function in membrane scission . The lipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is also a key endocytic regulator ( 2 , 23 – 26 ) . A complete understanding of endocytosis will therefore require analysis of how the lipid phosphatase synaptojanin , actin , BAR , and F - BAR proteins contribute to plasma membrane remodeling and scission . Results and Discussion Reduced Scission Ef ﬁ ciency in Mutants of Rvs161 / 167 BAR Proteins Provides an Opportunity to Identify Additional Scission Factors Genetically and Chemically . We developed a genetic strategy to identify factors that function in endocytic vesicle scission . The endocytic coat / adaptor protein Sla1 was previously established as a marker for endocytic internalization in vivo ( 5 , 27 ) . In WT cells , Sla1 - red ﬂ uorescent protein ( RFP ) ﬁ rst assembles at the cell cortex and then moves toward the cell interior during membrane invagination ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . As we showed previously , deletion of RVS161 or RVS167 , which encode the subunits of a heterodimeric BAR protein , results in a unique phenotype : Sla1 - GFP moves off the cell surface but fails to be released and retracts back to the cell surface ( 5 ) ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . We proposed that this phenotype represents failure of membrane scission . Consistent with this in - terpretation , the Rvs proteins arrive at the endocytic site just be - fore scission ( 5 , 28 ) . To verify that Sla1 retraction in rvs167 Δ mutants represents scission failure , we examined the dynamics of a ﬂ uorescently la - beled endocytic cargo , Alexa Fluor - 488 C 5 - α - factor ( A488 α - fac - tor ) in rvs167 Δ cells . When Sla1 - RFP retracted back to the cell surface in rvs167 Δ mutant cells , A488 α - factor patches also retracted to the cell surface ( 100 % of Sla1 retraction events , n = 15 ) ( Fig . 1 C , Right and Movie S1 ) .

These results validate Sla1 - RFP re - traction behavior as a reporter of membrane scission failure . Interestingly , the Sla1 - GFP retraction phenotype is not fully penetrant in rvs161 Δ or rvs167 Δ cells , as we reported previously ( 5 ) . Both rvs161 Δ and rvs167 Δ single mutants ( 19 . 7 % ± 1 . 2 and 21 . 5 % ± 3 . 9 , respectively ) and rvs161 Δ rvs167 Δ double mutants ( 23 . 2 % ± 1 . 8 ) only displayed a partial scission defect ( Fig . 1 A ) . This partial penetrance suggests that proteins of other endocytic modules are also involved in endocytic vesicle scission . However , our previous analysis of Sla1 - GFP dynamics in over 60 endocytic mutants revealed that the retraction phenotype is unique to rvs mutants ( 5 ) . Although the yeast dynamin Vps1 was reported to be present at endocytic sites and to contribute to ef ﬁ cient scis - sion ( 29 ) , we failed to ﬁ nd evidence for its recruitment to endocytic sites or a strong contribution to scission . Only 3 . 93 % of Abp1 - marked endocytic patches showed coincident Vps1 local - ization ( Table S1 ) , and the vps1 Δ mutant did not enhance the retraction incidence of an rvs167 Δ mutant in our analysis ( Fig . S1 A ) . Although a consensus has not yet been reached on whether Vps1 plays a direct role in endocytosis , there is general agreement that , in contrast to the situation in mammalian cells , Vps1 does not play an obligate role in endocytic vesicle scission . We used a genetic enhancer strategy to identify factors im - portant for scission . We reasoned that diminution of the function of a protein involved in scission in combination with an rvs mutant should speci ﬁ cally enhance the scission defect . The function of various endocytic proteins was perturbed in the rvs null background , and we tested for enhancement of the scission defect by quantifying Sla1 - GFP retraction events . Robust Actin Polymerization Is Required for Endocytic Membrane Scission in the Absence of the Rvs Proteins . Actin polymerization is required for formation of endocytic membrane invaginations in yeast , making assessment of actin ’ s contribution to scission dif ﬁ - cult . Previous studies found that high concentrations of Latrun - culin - A ( Lat - A ) , a drug that sequesters actin monomers , block invagination ( 27 ) , whereas low concentrations slow actin assembly at endocytic sites but still allow invagination formation ( 30 ) . We tested whether levels of Lat - A that have undetectable or barely detectable effects in WT cells would increase Sla1 - GFP retraction in an rvs167 Δ background . As shown in Fig . 2 A , actin patches can assemble in 16 μ M Lat - A in WT cells or in 4 μ M Lat - A in rvs167 Δ mutant cells . In WT cells , Sla1 patch internalization decreased in a dose - dependent manner in the presence of Lat - A , but retraction events did not increase ( Fig . 2 B and Movie S2 ) . Strikingly , patch internalization in rvs167 Δ mutant cells was much more sensitive to Lat - A , which indicates that actin assembly and BAR proteins co - operate to drive endocytic invagination formation . Moreover , Sla1 retraction was markedly increased by addition of Lat - A at con - centrations of only 0 . 5 μ M ( 24 % retraction ) to 2 μ M ( 55 % re - traction ) ( Fig . 2 C and Movie S2 ) , which had essentially no effect on patches in WT cells ( Fig . 2 B ) . These results reveal synergistic contributions of actin polymerization and BAR protein assembly to both membrane invagination and vesicle scission . To explore how different regulators of actin polymerization contribute to membrane scission , we examined endocytic scission ef ﬁ ciency in mutants of various actin nucleation - promoting fac - tors ( NPFs ) in an rvs167 Δ background . Different NPFs likely nucleate actin ﬁ laments for different functions at endocytic sites ( 15 , 31 ) . In budding yeast , the Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by several NPFs , including Pan1 , type I myosins Myo3 / 5 , and the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - related Las17 , through carboxyl - terminal Arp2 / 3 binding ( CA ) domains and the WASP CA ( WCA ) domain in Las17 ( 15 , 31 – 34 ) . The NPF ac - tivities of both Las17 and Myo5 are signi ﬁ cantly higher than that of Pan1 in vitro , and Las17 and Myo5 NPF activities play par - ticularly crucial roles in vivo ( 15 ) . Las17 arrives at endocytic sites earlier than Myo5 , and these two proteins primarily initiate as - sembly and promote internalization , respectively . Importantly , deletion of the CA domain of either Las17 or Myo5 severely re - duced its NPF activity in vitro but had only modest effects on endocytic internalization in vivo , suggesting that in the absence of one NPF , the other can partially substitute ( 15 , 35 , 36 ) ( Fig . 2 D and Movie S3 ) . We combined rvs167 Δ mutants with mutants of the Arp2 / 3 activation domains of Las17 ( las17 - WCA Δ ) , Pan1 ( pan1 - CA Δ ) , and Myo5 ( myo5 - CA Δ ) , respectively ( Fig . 2 D ) . Strikingly , scission failure increased in rvs167 Δ las17 - WCA Δ mutants ( 69 % ) or rvs167 Δ myo5 - CA Δ mutants ( 49 % ) but not in rvs167 Δ pan1 - CA Δ mutants ( 18 % ) , compared with scission in rvs167 Δ mutants ( 19 . 7 % ) .

The lack of enhancement of the rvs167 Δ scission defect by the pan1 - CA Δ , the vps1 Δ , or an end3 Δ mutant ( Fig . S1 ) demonstrates the speci ﬁ city of the observed effects . We next performed a ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis assay on the same set of mutants , quantifying the percentage of cells scoring positive for vacuole ﬂ uorescence . Both pan1 - CA Δ and myo5 - CA Δ displayed normal vacuole staining with Lucifer Yellow ( LY ) ( 94 % of cells scored normal for uptake , n = 124 ) , whereas the las17 - WCA Δ exhibited a modest LY uptake defect ( 74 . 7 % of cells scored normal for uptake , n = 186 ) ( Fig . 2 E ) . However , LY uptake was strongly reduced in the rvs167 Δ las17 - WCA Δ double - mutant cells ( 29 % of cells scored normal for uptake , n = 105 ) and in the rvs167 Δ myo5 - CA Δ double - mutant cells ( 35 % ) but not in the rvs167 Δ pan1 - CA Δ mutant cells ( 71 % ) . Thus , the LY uptake results correspond well with the increased Sla1 retraction rates , which our α - factor assay ( Fig . 1 C and D ) established as a measure of scission failure rate . These results support the conclusion that robust actin nucleation and BAR protein as - sembly function together to drive both the membrane in - vagination and the scission steps of the endocytic pathway . We also asked whether increased NPF activity can compensate for the rvs167 Δ scission defect in vivo by eliminating Bbc1 . Bbc1 inhibits Las17 ’ s NPF activity in vitro ( 15 , 37 , 38 ) , and its absence causes overactivation of actin nucleation in vivo ( 5 , 37 ) . As shown in Fig . 2 D , BBC1 deletion did not improve the scission ef ﬁ ciency in rvs167 Δ mutants . These results suggest that actin polymerization and BAR proteins make mechanistically distinct contributions to membrane scission . How actin polymerization contributes to membrane scission is now an important question . Filament assembly might generate a pinching force that contributes directly to membrane scission . Indeed , actin polymerization can deform lipid vesicles in vitro ( 39 ) and contributes to endocytic membrane constriction in mamma - lian cells ( 7 , 20 , 40 ) . Alternatively , actin ﬁ lament association with membranes can in ﬂ uence the local lipid distribution ( 41 ) , and might therefore contribute to lipid phase segregation ( 42 ) . Such an effect might be augmented by actin - mediated pulling forces ( 41 ) . A line tension at the phase boundary might drive scission ( 2 , 43 ) . Indeed , Römer et al . ( 44 ) implicated actin in membrane re - organization in Shiga toxin - induced endocytic membrane tubules , which they suggested , in turn , promoted scission . In vitro experi - ments ( 45 – 48 ) and theoretical models ( 43 , 49 , 50 ) suggest that the interfacial force generated at a lipid phase boundary could gen - erate suf ﬁ cient force to induce membrane scission . Involvement of Invagination Tip - Associated Synaptojanin Sjl2 in Scission . Previously , by mutating two of the three budding yeast synaptojanins , we showed that hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphates is important for multiple endocytic steps , including vesicle scission ( 26 ) , and we proposed that BAR proteins , which are recruited to endocytic sites at essentially the same time as synaptojanin , func - tion cooperatively with synaptojanin to mediate scission ( 2 ) . Be - cause the sjl1 Δ sjl2 Δ double mutant used in our previous studies has a pronounced global de ﬁ cit in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( 51 ) , it was important to test the speci ﬁ city of synaptojanin ’ s scission function via a less severe disruption of synaptojanin function . Thus , to ex - plore the functional relationship between BAR proteins and syn - aptojanin , we both turned off and overexpressed SJL2 in rvs167 Δ cells . Sjl2 is the only yeast synaptojanin present speci ﬁ cally at endocytic sites , where it is recruited to invagination tips around the time of scission ( 26 , 52 ) . Loss of Sjl2 expression in rvs167 Δ cells caused a pronounced synergistic decrease in scission ef ﬁ ciency , from 20 % failure to 55 % failure ( Fig . 3 A and Movie S4 ) . Addi - tionally , Sjl2 overexpression using the powerful pGal promoter reduced the frequency of the membrane scission defect in the rvs167 Δ mutant from 20 % to 8 % ( Fig . 3 B ) . These studies suggest that hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphates has a speci ﬁ c role in endocytic vesicle scission . Sjl2 might promote scission by gener - ating a lipid phase boundary ( 2 ) , relaxing membrane tension on the tubule by triggering release of coat proteins attached to as - sembling actin ﬁ laments ( 53 ) , or both .

However , the precise biological functions of BAR and F - BAR proteins are still not clear . Budding yeast have only one BAR protein , Rvs161 / 167 , but have ﬁ ve F - BAR proteins : Syp1 , Bzz1 , Hof1 , and Rgd1 / 2 . Syp1 and Bzz1 but not Hof1 and Rgd1 / 2 are found at endocytic sites . Syp1 may play a role in generating initial curvature , but this protein departs from endo - cytic sites before they become deeply invaginated ( 3 , 14 ) . In con - trast , Bzz1 is recruited to endocytic sites at the onset of formation of the deeply invaginated membrane . Bzz1 is a syndapin - like protein , which has a predicted N - terminal F - BAR domain and two C - terminal Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains ( Fig . 4 A ) . Bzz1 physically interacts with and activates Las17 and localizes to endocytic patches ( 15 , 34 , 37 , 38 ) . However , BZZ1 deletion alone did not cause a readily detectable actin , endocytic , or growth phenotype ( 15 ) . To test whether Bzz1 has a role in membrane scission , we generated bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ double mutants and quanti ﬁ ed Sla1 - GFP retraction events . Strikingly , the Sla1 - GFP retraction fre - quency was markedly higher in bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ cells ( 45 % ) than in rvs167 Δ cells ( 21 . 5 % ) ( Fig . 4 B and Movie S5 ) . Consistently , bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ cells exhibited a signi ﬁ cantly more severe LY uptake defect ( 42 % of cells scored for normal uptake ) than rvs167 Δ cells ( 72 % ) ( Fig . 2 E ) . Correspondingly , bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ cells grew very poorly , whereas rvs167 Δ cells grew relatively normally at 25 °C ( Fig . 4 C ) , in agreement with published data ( 56 ) . Combining mutants of the other three known F - BAR proteins , Syp1 , Hof1 , and Rgd1 / 2 , with rvs167 Δ had no effect on scission ef ﬁ ciency , consistent with the early arrival and departure of Syp1 and the absence of Hof1 and Rgd1 / 2 at endocytic sites . Together , these results identify Bzz1 as an F - BAR protein im - portant for ef ﬁ cient endocytic vesicle scission . In the ﬁ rst part of our study , we showed that robust actin nu - cleation activity is important for endocytic membrane scission . Also , we previously demonstrated that Bzz1 relieves Sla1 in - hibition of Las17 NPF activity in vitro ( 15 ) . Thus , one possibility was that Bzz1 affects membrane scission by regulating Las17 NPF activity . To test this possibility , we generated bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ in the background of the las17 - WCA Δ mutant , which has severely di - minished Las17 NPF activity . Strikingly , more than 80 % of Sla1 - GFP patches displayed retraction movements in bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ las17 - WCA Δ triple mutants , which was more severe than in las17 - WCA Δ rvs167 Δ double mutants ( 69 % of patches ; P = 0 . 011 ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . This in vivo genetic analysis establishes that loss of Bzz1 ’ s interaction with Las17 is not the sole cause of the enhanced membrane scission defect observed in the bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ mutant , a conclusion that is further supported by analysis of Sla1 retraction frequency in bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ bbc1 Δ mutants . Bbc1 inhibits Las17 ’ s NPF activity ( 5 , 37 ) . However , these triple mutants displayed similar Sla1 - GFP retraction rates to the rvs167 Δ bzz1 Δ double mutant ( 46 . 6 % of patches ) . Together , these results suggest that Bzz1 contributes to membrane scission via a mechanism in - dependent of its actin assembly activity . Corresponding to the high incidence of Sla1 - GFP retraction , bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ las17 - WCA Δ triple mutants displayed a more severe growth defect than bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ or rvs167 Δ las17 - WCA Δ double mutants ( Fig . 4 C ) . Although sequence homology ( Fig . 4 A ) identi ﬁ es a highly probable F - BAR domain in Bzz1 , we performed a preliminary analysis of the protein ’ s interaction with itself and lipids to support this identi ﬁ cation . We expressed Bzz1 - HA and Bzz1 - Myc alleles in a diploid strain , ﬁ nding that Bzz1 - Myc coimmunoprecipitates with Bzz1 - HA , whereas control Bzz1 without an HA or myc tag does not ( Fig . 4 D , Lower ) . These data indicate that Bzz1 associates with itself , similar to mammalian F - BAR proteins . Furthermore , as shown in Fig . 4 E , Bzz1 bound to liposomes containing phospha - tidylcholine ( PC ) , phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , and 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 but not to liposomes containing only PC and PE . We next puri ﬁ ed recombinant Bzz1 in which a conserved positively charged residue in the presumed F - BAR domain was changed to glutamate ( R37E ) ( Fig . 4 A ) . This allele was modeled after the K33E mutant of the F - BAR protein FBP17 , which causes a defect in membrane binding and tubulation activities ( 13 ) . As shown in Fig . 4 E , the analogous mutant of Bzz1 also caused a signi ﬁ cant decrease in binding to PC / PE / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes . These results indicate that an arginine residue conserved in F - BAR proteins is important for Bzz1 binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing lipid bilayers . To explore the function of the Bzz1 F - BAR domain in scission in living cells , we generated a bzz1 - R37E - GFP mutant allele and ﬁ rst analyzed its localization . Real - time imaging demonstrated that Bzz1 - R37E - GFP localized to cortical patches in a similar manner to the WT protein ( Fig . 4 F ) , consistent with the obser - vation that Bzz1 is recruited to endocytic sites through its SH3 domain ( 38 ) . The lifetime of Bzz1 - R37E - GFP at patches is shorter relative to the WT protein ( from 16 s to 12 s ) . The recruitment of the mutant protein to endocytic sites provided an opportunity to test the importance of the F - BAR domain for scission . Similar to a bzz1 Δ mutant , the bzz1 - R37E mutant did not show a pronounced retraction phenotype ( Fig . 4 G and Movie S5 ) . However , when the bzz1 - R37E mutant was combined with rvs167 Δ , the Sla1 - GFP re - traction frequency increased to 41 % ( Fig . 4 G ) , which is very similar to the frequency in the rvs167 Δ bzz1 Δ cells . These results establish that Bzz1 F - BAR domain function is important for membrane scission . Importantly , Bzz1 and Bzz1 - R37E mutant proteins both released Sla1 inhibition of Las17 ’ s NPF activity to a similar level in vitro ( Fig . S2 ) , supporting the conclusion that the Bzz1 F - BAR domain affects membrane scission independent of Bzz1 ’ s effects on Las17 NPF activity . Bzz1 F - BAR Protein Associates with the Base of the Endocytic Invagination . To investigate further how Bzz1 and Rvs167 co - operate to promote membrane scission , we examined Bzz1 and Rvs167 spatiodynamics simultaneously by two - color live - cell im - aging . Rvs167 - RFP assembly at the endocytic site is characterized by a rapid increase in ﬂ uorescence , followed by a rapid decrease at the time of scission ( 5 , 28 ) ( Fig . 5 A ) .

Consistently , live - cell imaging and immuno - EM previously re - vealed that Rvs167 localizes along the tubules of invaginated membranes ( 4 , 5 ) . To verify that Bzz1 is at the base of endocytic invaginations , we quantitatively analyzed , frame by frame , the positions of Bzz1 , Myo5 , and Sla1 centroids in movies and calculated the distances between the mean centroid positions . Myo5 and Bzz1 have been suggested to interact physically and to function together at the base of endocytic invaginations ( 4 , 5 , 38 ) . When 60 Bzz1 and Myo5 patches were examined in movies from 15 cells , the average closest and farthest distances separating their centroid positions were 20 . 6 ± 11 . 9 nm and 60 . 0 ± 21 . 6 nm , respectively , during the time when both proteins were present at endocytic sites . However , when 78 Bzz1 and Sla1 patches in 18 cells were examined , the average closest and farthest distances separating their centroid positions were 39 . 2 ± 27 . 1 nm and 155 . 4 ± 62 . 8 nm , respectively , during the time when both proteins were present at endocytic sites . These results are consistent with the observation that in reconstituted endocytic patches , Bzz1 decorates the Las17 - coated beads , whereas Rvs167 associates with actin tails ( 55 ) . Thus , Bzz1 arrives ﬁ rst at the endocytic site and remains at the base of the invagination , whereas Rvs167 arrives subsequently and coats the tubule , suggesting unique roles for these two proteins in endocytic membrane remodeling . Bzz1 F - BAR Protein Stabilizes Endocytic Invaginations . Previous studies revealed that deletion of BBC1 increases the distance of Sla1 inward movement ( 5 ) . As a result , Sla1 retraction movements can be observed more clearly in rvs167 Δ bbc1 Δ mutants ( Fig . 5 C , Left and Movie S6 ) . Unexpectedly , in a bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ bbc1 Δ triple mutant , Sla1 - GFP patches retracted toward a different position from their origin ( Fig . 5 C , Right and Movie S6 ) . Tracking of in - dividual retracting Sla1 - GFP patches in rvs167 Δ bbc1 Δ and bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ bbc1 Δ mutants using a particle - tracking algorithm ( 27 ) further supported this surprising observation ( Fig . 5 D ) . As shown in Fig . 5 E , on average , the centers of Sla1 - GFP ﬂ uorescence ended 84 nm ( n = 40 from 10 cells ) from the original internalization position in rvs167 Δ bbc1 Δ mutants , and 178 nm ( n = 50 from 14 cells ) from the original internalization position in bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ bbc1 Δ mutants . Because centroids for endocytic sites in WT cells showed movements of ∼ 70 – 80 nm , this range is likely a re ﬂ ection of the limit of the precision with which the position of a ﬂ uores - cence centroid could be determined .

To examine Bzz1 ’ s contribution to endocytic site stability during retraction in the presence of Bbc1 , Las17 - GFP dynamics were analyzed using total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , which images the cell surface to a depth of only ∼ 100 nm . Las17 - GFP , which localizes to the base of endocytic invaginations and possibly along the tubule , did not move from its original position throughout its lifetime in WT cells ( Fig . 5 F and G and Movie S7 ) . In bzz1 Δ mutant cells , however , Las17 - GFP appeared and at ﬁ rst remained stationary but then moved on the membrane surface before disappearing ( Fig . 5 F and G and Movie S7 ) .

The Las17 - GFP patches also remained near their original posi - tion in rvs167 Δ mutants ( 78 nm , n = 48 from 15 cells ) . In agreement with the results from single - mutant cells , Las17 - GFP in bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ mutant cells displayed movement as well ( av - erage = 116 nm , n = 44 from 18 cells ) . These results show that Bzz1 prevents sliding of endocytic invaginations along the plasma membrane . The timing of the movements and their occurrence in bzz1 Δ single mutants , which do not show the retraction phe - notype , are consistent with endocytic site movements occurring on initiation of actin polymerization and invagination formation . We next determined whether internalization and retraction of Sla1 , a marker for the invagination tip , occur coincident with the sliding of base - localized proteins along the plasma membrane in bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ mutants . Two - color wide - ﬁ eld imaging demon - strated that Las17 stayed at the original position after Sla1 - GFP internalization in an rvs167 Δ mutant ( Fig . S3 A , Left ) . However , Las17 - GFP patches slide away from their original position ( Fig . 5 I ) in the direction of Sla1 - RFP movement in bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ mutants ( Fig . S3 A , Right ) , and the base began to move when Sla1 was internalized , suggesting that forces driving internalization are responsible for base sliding in bzz1 Δ cells . The range of these movements was enhanced by bbc1 Δ ( Fig . S3 B ) . To document movement of the invagination base further , we observed dy - namics of the base - localized protein Myo5 - GFP in both rvs167 Δ and bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ mutants . Just as with Las17 - GFP patches , Myo5 - GFP patches did not move from their origins in rvs167 Δ mutants but slid together with Sla1 - RFP patches in the bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ mutant as Sla1 - RFP internalized ( Fig . S3 C ) . These results establish a role for Bzz1 in stabilizing endocytic sites . Two - color imaging demonstrated that Bzz1 stays at the cortex after Sla1 - GFP internalization in an rvs167 Δ mutant ( Fig . 5 J ) , consistent with a role in maintaining stability of the membrane base during internalization and scission . Ultrastructural Analysis Reveals that Rvs161 / 167 and Bzz1 Cooperate to Establish Proper Endocytic Membrane Geometry . Previously , yeast endocytic invaginations had been viewed ultrastructurally in chemically ﬁ xed cells and appeared as tubules of uniform di - ameter ( 4 , 57 ) . To gain insights into how Rvs161 / 167 and Bzz1 contribute to scission , we used a high - pressure freezing and freeze - substitution ( HPF - FS ) protocol to visualize endocytic site morphology in WT , rvs167 Δ , bzz1 Δ , and bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ double - deletion strains ( Fig . 6 ) . Because furrow - like membrane com - partment occupied by Can1 ( MCC ) / eisosome invaginations have been described in yeast EM studies ( 58 – 61 ) , correct identi ﬁ ca - tion of endocytic invaginations is crucial . Importantly , because furrow invaginations are induced in stationary cells ( 58 – 61 ) , we only analyzed log - phase cells . In our analysis , deep endocytic invaginations ( > 40 nm in length ) in WT cells showed a ﬂ ask - shaped morphology , with a wide base , narrow tubule , and wide bud ( Fig . 6 A , Upper Left ) . This ﬂ ask shape is distinct from that of furrow invaginations , which have parallel membranes ( 61 ) . An - other distinctive feature of endocytic sites is a surrounding ri - bosome - free zone , which likely results from the actin cloud surrounding endocytic invaginations ( 4 , 28 , 57 ) . These deep membrane invaginations are essentially identical to those established as endocytic sites by correlative ﬂ uorescence - trans - mission EM ( 28 ) , and we con ﬁ rmed by serial sectioning that they are tubular endocytic sites and not furrow - like MCC / eisosomes ( Fig . S4 ) . Moreover , we could observe these structures in small buds , which lack eisosomes ( 62 ) . In rvs167 Δ cells , the diameter of the endocytic tubule was signi ﬁ cantly larger relative to WT cells ( 6 . 6 ± 2 . 0 - nm average tubule lumen diameter vs . 4 . 6 ± 2 . 1 nm in WT cells ) ( Fig . 6 A , Lower Left , and B ) , suggesting that Rvs proteins contribute to endocytic vesicle scission by constricting the tubule . Interestingly , cells lacking BZZ1 show widened tubule regions ( 8 . 4 ± 2 . 7 - nm tubule lumen diameter vs . 4 . 6 ± 2 . 1 nm in WT cells ) ( Fig . 6 A , Upper Right , and B ) and the frequent occurrence ( 21 % ) of invaginations tilted from the perpendicular axis at angles beyond 30° , which was not observed in WT cells . Although the mor - phological changes in both single mutants were subtle , rvs167 Δ bzz1 Δ double - deletion cells showed a synergistic defect in tubule constriction , thus replacing ﬂ ask - shaped invaginations by wide cylindrical invaginations ( Fig . 6 A , Lower Right ) with both dra - B A rvs167 Δ WT bzz1 Δ bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ tubule bud I n va g i n a t i o n l e ng t h bzz1 Δ rvs167 Δ WT rvs167 Δ bzz1 Δ Diameter of bud ( nm ) 100 0 20 40 60 80 120 160 140 0 25 5 10 15 20 30 35 ) m n ( h t gn e l no i t a n i g av n I Diameter of tubule ( nm ) ) m n ( h t gn e l no i t a n i g av n I 100 0 20 40 60 80 120 160 140 0 25 5 10 15 20 30 35 Fig . 6 .

Thus , the Bzz1 F - BAR protein cooperates with the Rvs161 / 167 BAR protein to establish proper invagination morphology . Further - more , invaginations of 100 nm or more in length were more frequent in the rvs167 Δ and rvs167 Δ bzz1 Δ deletion mutant strains , probably re ﬂ ecting the membrane scission defect ( Fig . 6 B ) . The wide - neck phenotype , the rvs167 Δ bzz1 Δ double mu - tant , is completely distinct from any invagination seen in WT cells and is highly penetrant . None of the ﬂ ask - shaped invagi - nations of WT cells can be found in rvs167 Δ bzz1 Δ double - mu - tant cells , and , conversely , there are no invaginations in WT cells that have the wide - neck phenotype . Our EM studies lead us to conclude that formation of the characteristic ﬂ ask shape of endocytic invaginations in budding yeast involves cooperation between the base formation activity of Bzz1 ( F - BAR protein ) and the tubule constriction activity of Rvs167 ( BAR protein ) , augmented by actin assembly forces . Because tubules formed even in rvs167 Δ bzz1 Δ double mutants , we conclude that the primary function of the yeast Rvs161 / 167 BAR and Bzz1 F - BAR proteins in vivo lies in constriction and stabilization of the tubular endocytic membrane rather than in tubule formation . Although BAR and F - BAR domains share some structural and biochemical features ( 63 ) , several observations suggested that they have distinct functions in membrane remodeling . First , F - BAR domains generally form larger tubules ( 60 – 100 nm ) than BAR domains ( 22 - nm diameter ) in vitro ( 13 ) . The 22 - nm value is similar to the yeast endocytic tubule ’ s outer diameter of around 17 nm ( ∼ 4 . 6 nm + 2 × 6 - nm membrane bilayer width ) that we measured for WT cells ( Fig . 6 A and B ) . Second , F - BAR domains but not BAR domains are predicted to bind to ﬂ at membranes and to generate membrane curvature ( 64 ) . Third , Bzz1 - GFP ( F - BAR domain ) appears at endocytic sites about 10 s before Rvs167 - GFP ( BAR domain ) in vivo ( 15 ) . Fourth , Bzz1 localizes at the base of the endocytic invagination , whereas Rvs167 localizes along the length of the tubule region ( which has a higher curvature ) ( this study and refs . 4 , 5 , 15 ) . This last ob - servation is consistent with spontaneous segregation of F - BAR and BAR proteins to adjacent membrane segments of the same tubules both in vivo and in vitro ( 64 ) . Synthesis . Integrating the various results presented here , we propose that Bzz1 F - BAR protein is recruited to endocytic sites when the membrane has a relatively low curvature and assembles a rigid invagination base ( Fig . 7 A , step 1 ) . Bzz1 is a yeast homolog of metazoan syndapin and contains an N - terminal F - BAR domain and two SH3 domains implicated in actin assembly regulation at endocytic sites ( 15 ) . Like BAR proteins , F - BAR proteins can induce membrane tubulation both in vivo and in vitro ( 9 ) . In addition , many direct binding interactions between F - BAR and endocytic proteins have been discovered , and a role for F - BAR proteins in regulating actin polymerization in close proximity to the plasma membrane has been proposed ( 15 , 54 , 65 ) . Recently , the F - BAR protein FCHo , related to yeast Syp1 , was shown by immuno - EM to associate with the bases of endocytic invaginations in mammalian cells ( 66 ) . F - BAR domain proteins form ring - or spiral - like oligomers around the membrane tubules in vitro ( 13 , 64 ) . Such structures are predicted to be very rigid ( 64 ) , and hence may provide a stable platform at the base of the in - vagination against which assembling actin ﬁ laments can generate forces . Interestingly , Bzz1 binds to the Arp2 / 3 activator Las17 , and we propose that these proteins form a stable base , which resists actin assembly forces , enabling ef ﬁ cient actin assembly - driven endocytic tubule extension and constriction , which , in turn , gen - erates higher membrane curvature ( Fig . 7 A , step 2 ) . The BAR domain proteins are then recruited to these more highly curved membrane tubules , working cooperatively with actin assembly forces to create deeply invaginated endocytic membranes , result - ing in further tubule constriction ( Fig . 7 A , step 3 ) and , ultimately , in scission ( Fig . 7 A , step 4 ) . We speculate that in the absence of the F - BAR base , actin forces are not as coherently directed ; as a re - sult , the base moves in response to actin assembly forces and the invaginations tend to tilt to one side or the other ( Fig . 7 B ) . A recent study of dynamin - de ﬁ cient mammalian cells revealed striking similarities between endocytosis in mammals and yeast ( 7 ) . Instead of the classic constricted clathrin - coated pits , dyna - min - de ﬁ cient mammalian cells formed long BAR protein - deco - rated tubules in an actin and BAR protein - dependent manner . These structures closely resemble yeast endocytic invaginations , whose formation is also mediated by actin and BAR protein assembly ( Fig . 7 A ) , providing strong support for the notion that actin and BAR proteins play similar roles during endocytosis in yeast and mammals . Materials and Methods Media and Strains .

SequenceswereinitiallyalignedusingtheCLUSTALWprogram ( DNA Data Bank of Japan ) , and the alignment was then optimized using the BOXSHADEprogram ( SwissInstituteofBioinformatics ) . TheGenBankaccession numbers for the sequences are as follows : Homo sapiens Formin - binding protein17FBP17 ( Q96RU3 . 2 ) , H . sapiens Cdc42 - interactingprotein4 ( Q15642 . 3 ) , Caenorhabditis elegans ( transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly ) ho - molog family member ( toca - 1 ) ( NP _ 741722 ) , Rattus norvegicus Syndapin 1 ( Q9Z0W5 . 1 ) , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bzz1 ( P38822 . 1 ) . EM . Yeast cells were prepared by HPF - FS as described by Buser and McDonald ( 74 ) , with modi ﬁ cations . Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium containing 1 % glucose , collected by ﬁ ltration through syringe ﬁ lters ( 4 - mm diameter ) , aspirated in cellulose capillaries ( 75 ) , and high - pressure frozen in a Wohl - wend HPF Compact 01 high - pressure freezer . For structural studies of the membrane geometry , FS was carried out overnight in acetone containing 2 % ( vol / vol ) glutaraldehyde , 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate , and 5 % ( vol / vol ) water ( 76 , 77 ) using a Leica AFS FS system ( Leica Microsystems ) . At room temperature , the samples were washed ﬁ ve times in ethanol and then in ﬁ ltrated with 50 % ( vol / vol ) Epon in ethanol for 2 h and pure Epon for 6 h . The Epon was exchanged once more and polymerized at 60 °C for 3 d . Thin sections ( 70 nm ) were cut and collected on formvar - ﬁ lmed copper grids and stained with 2 % ( wt / vol ) aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 min and 2 % ( wt / vol ) lead citrate for 1 min . The sections were observed at 120 kV in a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) and recorded with an Ultrascan 1000 CCD camera ( Gatan , Inc . ) . The resulting images were not soft - ware - processedexcept for brightness / contrast adjustments and image rotation . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We are grateful to Dr .
