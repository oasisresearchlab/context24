We observe no significant effect of gender on grades in our IE introductory mechanics courses at Loyola Marymount University , but we do observe a significant gender gap on FCI normalized gains , with males achieving higher gains than females . Over the past three years , FCI gains have improved for both male and female students in IE classes taught with the Thinking in Physics ( TIP ) pedagogy . However , a gender gap on FCI gains remains , even when scientific reasoning abilities are taken into account . Indeed , the gap appears much greater for students with the strongest scientific reasoning skills and the highest FCI gains . Data from IE introductory physics courses using modeling at Edward Little High School in Maine show a similar result with some additional data showing a reverse gender gap for those students with very weak scientific reasoning skills .

However , our research demonstrates that those students who have weak reasoning skills are likely to have limited success in physics , even in interactive courses [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] . The Lawson Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning Ability is a multiple - choice test that includes questions on conservation , proportional thinking , identification and control of variables , probabilistic thinking , and hypothetico - deductive reasoning [ 3 , 6 ] . We have found a strong correlation between individual students’ normalized gains on the Force Concept Inventory ( FCI ) and their pre - instruction scores on the Lawson Test in IE introductory mechanics classes at Loyola Marymount University ( LMU ) ( N = 98 , r = 0 . 54 ) and at Edward Little High School ( ELHS ) ( N = 199 , r = 0 . 53 ) [ 3 , 4 ] . The correlation between Lawson score and FCI G has been replicated by many others , including Dubson and Pollack at U . of Colorado [ 7 ] , Diff and Tache at Santa Fe Community College [ 8 ] , Pamela and Saul at U . of Central Florida [ 9 ] , Savinainen at Kuopion Lyseo High School in Finland [ 10 ] , and Pyper at BYU [ 11 ] . We have also found strong , positive correlations between individual students’ pre - instruction SAT scores and their normalized FCI gains at ELHS ( N = 335 , r = 0 . 57 ) and at LMU ( N = 292 , r = 0 . 46 ) [ 5 ] . Our research reveals that many students come to IE physics classes unable to use certain scientific reasoning skills needed to learn physics , and for those students , achieving good conceptual understanding in mechanics is unlikely . Two of us created the Thinking in Physics ( TIP ) program at LMU to enhance those reasoning skills . TIP identifies students as being at risk in introductory physics , based on their pre - instruction performance on the Lawson test and / or the SAT . We have previously described some of our methods and the effect they have had on students’ understanding of mechanics concepts as measured by improved normalized gains on the FCI [ 12 ] and in improvements in problem solving skills [ 13 ] . A gender gap in performance on the FCI and FMCE has been widely observed [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] with males achieving consistently higher average normalized gains than females . Some have speculated that the test itself is gender biased [ 17 ] . Osborn Popp , Meltzer , and Megowan - Romanowicz have presented evidence that the test is not systematically biased in favor of males [ 18 ] , suggesting that the observed gap represents a real difference between males and females in the conceptual understanding achieved in IE introductory mechanics . Recently , researchers at the U . of Colorado have suggested that a cause of the observed gender gap may be stereotype threat , and that it can be mitigated by reflective writing exercises [ 19 , 20 ] . We have examined various test data for our students in IE introductory mechanics courses and , in terms of class test averages and overall grades , we found no significant gender effects . However , males consistently achieved higher FCI normalized gains than females . We wondered whether TIP may have had an effect on this gap and whether the gap was consistent across all student reasoning levels . We found that , while TIP improved conceptual understanding for both males and females , a significant gap persists . We also found that the gap tends to be particularly large for students with the strongest reasoning skills and largest FCI gains . THINKING IN PHYSICS AND THE GENDER GAP TIP develops general thinking and problem solving skills . TIP requires students to keep thinking journals , encouraging metacognitive reflection . TIP utilizes a variety of games and puzzles , including Sudoku , to facilitate student problem solving development . Using software developed by the MIND Research Institute , TIP computer games build skills , using visual techniques that do not rely on language abilities , but do make heavy demands on working memory , requiring planning steps in advance to achieve a favorable outcome . TIP uses the context of physics to teach thinking about variables and their relationships . TIP activities include student group work and lab experiments . A more complete description of TIP and its success in developing conceptual understanding and problem solving skills is provided in earlier papers [ 12 , 13 ] . Each of us at LMU has developed our own courses with somewhat different features , emphasizing different aspects of the TIP pedagogy and utilizing it in somewhat different ways . In both versions of TIP , TIPC ( Coletta ) and TIPP ( Phillips ) , students show a significant gender gap on FCI scores , but show no significant gender gap on course grades . Students in TIPC have somewhat higher FCI gains than those in TIPP , and the gender gap is larger in TIPC . Compared with students in earlier pre - TIP IE classes taught by the same instructor in 2000 , 2002 , and 2006 , students in TIPC classes in 2007 , 2009 , and 2010 have shown improved conceptual understanding of introductory mechanics , as measured by improved FCI normalized gains G . However , the large pre - TIP gap of 0 . 18 ( G = 0 . 27 for females and 0 . 45 for males ) has not changed in TIPC classes ( G = 0 . 40 for females and 0 . 58 for males ) ( Fig . 1 ) . For TIPP , the instructor taught no comparable courses prior to the beginning of the TIP project . For TIPP classes taught in 2008 , 2009 , and 2010 , with a total of 75 females and 71 males , the gender gap was 0 . 09 ( G = 0 . 33 for females and 0 . 42 for males ) . The difference is statistically significant . A one - tailed t - test gives p < 0 . 005 . FIGURE 1 . Thinking in Physics pedagogy has substantially improved FCI normalized gains for both females and males , but a large gender gap remains . There were 58 females and 25 males in the pre - TIP classes , and 59 females and 39 males in the TIPC classes . Standard errors for each of the four averages range from 0 . 02 to 0 . 04 . SCIENTIFIC REASONING ABILITY AND FCI GENDER GAP Average scores for females on the Lawson test were significantly lower than for males in both TIP implementations ( 16 . 3 vs . 17 . 9 in TIPC and 15 . 9 vs . 17 . 5 in TIPP ) . Given the correlation between Lawson scores and FCI gains , it is conceivable that the gender gap in Lawson scores might partially account for the gender gap in FCI gains . However , when we examined gender differences for students with similar Lawson scores , we found something more complex . The gender gap is larger than the overall gap for students with similar high Lawson scores and smaller for students with similar low Lawson scores . TABLE 1 . Average FCI G and average Lawson scores for each quartile of Lawson scores for females and for males in TIPC . Standard errors for G within each quartile ranged from 0 . 03 to 0 . 07 . Thus , the male - female differences are significant for all but the lowest quartile . A one - tailed t - test on the highest male and female quartile gives p < 10 - 4 . Females Males Lawson FCI G Lawson FCI G 9 . 8 0 . 33 13 0 . 36 15 . 2 0 . 32 17 . 2 0 . 48 18 . 8 0 . 44 19 . 3 0 . 67 21 . 4 0 . 50 22 . 4 0 . 81 In TIPC classes , there is little or no gender gap in FCI normalized gains for students with Lawson test scores in the lowest quartile , but in the highest quartile the gap is exaggerated : for males FCI G averaged 0 . 81 , while for females FCI G averaged 0 . 50 ( Table 1 and Fig . 2 ) . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 2 F C I G Females Males Pre ‐ TIP TIPC FIGURE 2 . Average FCI G vs . average Lawson score for male and female Lawson quartiles in TIPC classes . In TIPP classes , there is little or no gender gap in FCI normalized gains for students with Lawson test scores in the lowest two quartiles . In the highest two quartiles , the gaps are larger , but not statistically significant ( Table 2 ) . However , if we lump together Lawson scores of 17 or higher ( the top two quartiles ) , providing a larger sample , the FCI G gap of 0 . 08 ( 0 . 50 for males and 0 . 42 for females ) is statistically significant . A one - tailed t - test yields p = 0 . 05 . TABLE 2 . Average FCI G and average Lawson scores for each quartile of Lawson scores for females and for males in TIPP . Standard errors for G within each quartile ranged from 0 . 03 to 0 . 07 . Females Males Lawson FCI G Lawson FCI G 11 . 9 0 . 23 10 . 6 0 . 28 15 . 0 0 . 29 15 . 2 0 . 28 17 . 3 0 . 37 18 . 0 0 . 47 20 . 8 0 . 45 21 . 6 0 . 53 Gender Gap At ELHS From 2002 to 2005 one of us used Modeling to teach introductory mechanics at Edward Little High School to a total of 199 students , 98 female and 101 males . The females’ average FCI normalized gain was 0 . 37 + 0 . 02 ( SE ) and the males’ average gain was 0 . 46 + 0 . 03 ( SE ) . A one - tailed t - test of these two populations shows statistical significance with p < 0 . 005 . However , the males scored significantly higher than females on the Lawson test , 16 . 9 vs . 14 . 9 , so this difference partially accounts for the difference in FCI gains . If we consider only data from students with Lawson scores of 19 or higher , a clearer picture emerges , consistent with the results from LMU . For the 20 females with scores in this highest range , the average FCI G was 0 . 53 + 0 . 04 ( SE ) , and for the 38 males in this Lawson range , the average FCI G was 0 . 66 + 0 . 04 ( SE ) , a highly significant difference . A one - tailed t - test yields p < 0 . 01 . The average Lawson scores in this range were not significantly different for males and females . FIGURE 3 . Gender gap at ELHS for Lawson scores of 19 or greater . Reverse Gender Gap At ELHS An interesting phenomenon is seen when we examine the subset of the ELHS data corresponding to Lawson scores of 10 or less , with 14 females and 7 males falling in this range . For those students with the weakest scientific reasoning skills , we observe a reverse gender gap on the FCI , with females achieving higher gains than males ( Fig . 3 ) . FIGURE 4 . Reverse gender gap for lowest range of Lawson scores at ELHS , scores of 10 or less . The 14 females with scores in this range had an average FCI G of 0 . 30 + 0 . 05 ( SE ) and the 7 males with scores in this range had an average FCI G of 0 . 14 + 0 . 04 ( SE ) . A two tailed t - test on the two groups yields p = 0 . 02 . A Conjecture For IE physics classes in schools with high at - risk populations , classes in which scores on the Lawson Test are very low , we conjecture that the class average FCI normalized gains for females may be higher than the class average gains for males . 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 8 12 16 20 24 F C I G Lawson Score Females Males 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 F C I G Females Males 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 1 F C I G Females Males SUMMARY AND QUESTIONS We find that , while there is no gender gap in course grades , there is a significant gender gap in FCI normalized gains . That gender gap is greatest for those students with the strongest reasoning skills and the highest FCI gains , with males having substantially higher gains than females . The gender gap is reversed for students with very low Lawson scores . The size of the gender gap varies both with the general IE approach ( TIP vs . Modeling ) and with specific instructor and methods ( TIPC vs . TIPP ) . These observations raise some important questions : Why are there differences in the two versions of TIP ? If stereotype threat is the source of much of the gender gap , why is there no gender gap in course grades ? Why is there an enhanced gender effect for students having the strongest reasoning abilities and a reverse gender effect for those with the weakest reasoning abilities ? REFERENCES 1 . R . R .
