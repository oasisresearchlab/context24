COMMENTARY Caveolae : static inpocketings of the plasma membrane , dynamic vesicles or plain artifact ? N . J . SEVERS Department of Cat iliac Medicine , Cardmthoracic Institute ( University of London ) , Dovehouse , London SW3 6LV , L ' K Introduction The presence of small ( 50 - 90 nm diameter ) vesicular invaginations ( caveolae ) in plasma membranes has been known since some of the earliest ultrastructural descriptions of cells , yet the nature and function of these structures continue to stimulate debate and controversy . From their association with subplasma - lemmal vesicles of similar dimensions , caveolae were originally assumed to be simple pinocytotic vesicles caught in the act of pinching - off from the plasma membrane . In vascular endothelial cells , this interpret - ation was refined and elaborated to explain bidirec - tional transport of substances across the blood vessel wall . In striated and smooth muscle , on the other hand , it was replaced by the concept of specialized , semi - permanent plasma membrane invaginations . The pre - cise mechanism by which the caveola - vesicle system mediates transendothelial transport and the functional significance of muscle caveolae have been extensively discussed , often with conflicting conclusions . One of the central interpretative difficulties in the past has been the dependence on glutaraldehyde fixation to give a faithful representation of membrane organization in vivo . This limitation can now be overcome with ultrarapid freezing techniques , and the nature of caveo - lae has been re - examined in a number of recent studies using this approach in endothelial cells ( McGuire & Twietmeyer , 1983 ; Robinson et al . 1984 ; Wagner & Andrews , 1985 ; Fr0kjaer - Jensen & Reese , 1986 ; Nogu - chi et al . 1986 ) and muscle cells ( Lee et al . 1983 ; Frank et al . 1987 ; Poulos et al . 1986 ) . The purpose of this article is to discuss briefly the impact of these findings and the questions they raise against the background of previously established concepts . infrastructure The main structural features of caveolae as seen in Journal of Cell Science 90 , 341 - 348 ( 1988 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1988 glutaraldehyde - fixed cardiac endothelial and muscle cells are illustrated in Figs 1 and 2 . In planar freczc - fracture views of the plasma membrane , caveolae appear as small circular breaks , which represent their openings to the exterior ( Figs 1A , 2A ) . The diameter , density and distribution of these openings vary in different cell types . In endothelial cells of cardiac capillaries ( Fig . 1A ) , for example , the caveola openings are = 40 nm in diameter , and occur at densities of 67 ^ tm ~ 2 on the luminal , and llOfim " 2 on the ablumi - nal , plasma membrane ; in neighbouring ventricular ( and papillary ) muscle cells , by contrast , they average —65 nm in diameter and have a density of just 4 - 6 / zm ~ 2 ( Simionescu et al . 1974 ; Gabella , 1978 ; Levin & Page , 1980 ) . In cardiac muscle the caveola openings are usually scattered irregularly over the plasma membrane surface , in some skeletal muscle fibres the distribution pattern is related to underlying sarcomeric organization , and smooth muscle caveolae are ordered into distinct rows and bands that lie parallel to the long axis of the cell ( e . g . see Devine et al . 1971 ; Gabella , 1978 ; Shafiq et al . 1979 ; Severs et al . 1985 ) . Fractures that follow the bulb - like membranous neck and body of the caveola ( Figs IB , 2B ) reveal few intramembrane particles ( IMP ) compared with the numbers present in the general plasma membrane , though in some smooth muscle cells a special ring of IMP circumscribes the caveola entrance ( e . g . sec Gabella & Blundell , 1978 ; Severs & Simons , 1986 ) . High - resolution scanning electron microscopy reveals that endothelial caveolae and vesicles have a striped bipolar surface structure ( Peters et al . 1985 ) , but whether this is also a feature of muscle caveolae is unknown . Linear and branched chains of connected caveolae are often abundant in endothelial cells ( Fig . IB ) and , though these may also sometimes occur in muscle ( Forbes et al . 1979 ; Severs et al . 1982 ) , a more common arrangement in cardiac muscle is for bunches of two or more caveolae to be suspended from the same neck ( Fig . 2B ) . The full extent of such 341 composite caveolae becomes more readily apparent when extracellular markers are used to stain structures that communicate with the exterior ( Figs 1C , 2C ) . Muscle caveolae In skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscle , extracellular markers ( applied after glutaraldehyde fixation as in Fig . 2C ) have repeatedly been shown to penetrate virtually the entire population of subplasmalemmal vesicles of similar dimensions to visibly patent caveolae ( e . g . see Forbes & Sperelakis , 1971 ; Devine et al . 1972 ; Gabella , 1973 ; Martinez - Palomo et al . 1973 ) . Those vesicles that appear free - floating are thus in reality caveolae , connected to the plasma membrane 2A Figs 1 , 2 . Comparison of the structural features of caveolae in glutaraldehyde - fixed cardiac capillary endothelial cells ( Fig . 1 ) and muscle cells ( Fig . 2 ) as seen in planar freeze - fracture view of the plasma membrane ( A ) , cross - fracture view ( B ) and thin - sectioning after Ruthenium Red staining ( C ) . In Figs 1A and 2A , caveolae are fractured across their necks , appearing as circular breaks in the plasma membrane fracture faces ( raised rims on the E - face , Fig . 1A ; depressions on the P - face , Fig . 2A ) . Note differences in diameter and numerical density of the caveolar openings in the endothelial cell ( Fig . 1A ) and the cardiac muscle cell ( Fig . 2A ) . Favourable fractures into the cytoplasm ( Figs IB , 2B ) provide side views of caveolae . Arrows indicate caveolae connected linearly in the endothelial cell ( Fig . IB ) and pairs of caveolae sharing the same neck in cardiac muscle ( Fig . 2B ) . Apparent vesicles ( arrowheads ) are abundant in the endothelial cell and can also be seen in cardiac muscle . Ruthenium Red applied after glutaraldehyde fixation ( C ) stains the surface coat in both cell types intensely and penetrates those structures that open to the exterior , enabling apparent vesicles to be identified as caveolae . p , plasma membrane ; cyt , cytoplasm .

As the idea that all vesicles in all muscle cells / fibres could always be caught simul - taneously in the act of fission or fusion is untenable , an endocytotic or exocytotic function was rejected in favour of the concept of static inpocketings of the plasma membrane . The problem then was to assign another function to these specialized semi - permanent cell surface domains . Many ideas have been con - sidered , among them that caveolae serve as membrane reservoirs facilitating plasma membrane expansion , as miniature stretch receptors or special ion transport / storage sites ( Essner et al . 1965 ; Gabella , 1973 , 1978 ; Popescu , 1974 ; Dulhunty & Franzini - Armstrong , 1975 ; Prescott & Brightman , 1976 ; Masson - P < § vet et al . 1979 ; Levin & Page , 1980 ) . Caveolae are , in some instances , intimately associated with sarcoplasmic reticulum , and have been discussed as functional equivalents , precursors and terminal ( cell surface ) ends of transverse tubules ( Devinee / al . 1972 ; Ishikawa & Yamada , 1975 ; Zampighi et al . 1975 ; Gabella , 1978 ; Forbes et al . 1979 ; Forbes & Sperelak - is , 1980 ) . A recent suggestion in studies with atrial myocytes is that caveolae may act as sites for targeted fusion of secretory granule membrane with plasma membrane ( Page et al . 1986 ) . Clues have also been sought from the differences in caveola number , size and distribution apparent between different functional classes of cell / fibre and between healthy versus dis - eased muscle ( e . g . see Masson - PeVet et al . 1979 ; Masson - P6vet & Gross , 1980 ; Bonilla et al . 1981 ; Shotton , 1982 ; Lee et al . 1986 ) . It has not , however , proved possible to integrate the diverse and fragmen - tary observations into a general theory of caveola function for muscle as a whole . Most of the theories that are amenable to experimental test have been discounted and the remainder are either restricted in their applicability or based more on conjecture than hard fact . Endothellal caveolae and vesicles A functional role for the caveolae of endothelial cells has , by contrast , long been widely accepted as part of a vesicle system responsible for the exchange of fluid , solutes and especially large hydrophilic molecules , between blood and tissue ( e . g . see Wagner & Casley - Smith , 1981 ) . The mainstream theory of endothelial vesicle transport , developed from observations on the fate of macromolecule tracers in cells fixed at intervals after presenting the tracer to the luminal surface , involves the coupling of endocytosis to exocytosis — a process referred to as transcytosis ( Simionescu , 1981 ) . In its simplest ( and original ) form , this involves vesicles pinching - off from the plasma membrane on one side of the cell and discharging their contents by fusion on the opposite side ( Palade & Bruns , 1968 ) . Caveolae , according to this view , would represent vesicles that are forming from or becoming incorpor - ated into the plasma membrane . One modification to this direct vesicle transport mechanism incorporates the possibility of transient fusions between cytoplasmic vesicles so that their contents become intermixed ( Clough & Michel , 1981 ) . Other refinements to the transcytosis theory were developed from the obser - vation that when the luminal plasma membrane is labelled ( e . g . with cationized ferritin ) before macro - molecules ( haempeptides ) are presented for transport , the caveolae and vesicles remain unlabelled with the ferritin , even though the haempeptides are taken up and apparently transported to the abluminal side by vesicles ( Simionescu , 1981 ) . This , reinforced by cyto - chemical and structural findings , led to the concept that the endothelial vesicles and caveolae constitute a membrane system that is quite separate and distinct from the plasma membrane . Vesicles are envisaged as repeatedly taking up and discharging their contents by shuttling back and forth across the cell , making tran - sient connections with the plasma membrane on each side , but maintaining their own distinctive compo - sition , structure and shape throughout . In this model , transient vesicle connection may occur at the general plasma membrane or at semi - permanent caveolae , and complete transendothelial channels may form tempor - arily by extension of a chain of fused vesicles and caveolae across the cell . Endothelial caveolae arc , from this viewpoint , interpreted as ( 1 ) transiently connected endothelial vesicles , ( 2 ) longer - lived plasma membrane invaginations composed of endothelial vesicle - like membrane , or ( 3 ) trans - endothelial channels . The debate as to which of these proposed transport mechanisms is the predominant or exclusive one , or indeed whether any of them are valid at all , has been fuelled from the results of post - fixation extracellular marking and ultrathin serial section studies ( Bund - gaardeia / . 1979 ; Fr0kjaer - jensen , 1980 , 1984 ; Davies & Kuczera , 1981 ; Chien et al . 1982 ; Noguchi et al . 1986 ) . These have consistently shown that the number of truly discrete cytoplasmic vesicles is much lower than was originally assumed from standard sections ; many apparently free vesicles in fact belong to long , branching , bead - like chains of fused vesicles ( racemose structures ) , which open to the cell surface via caveolae . From these findings , transport by vesicles if accepted at all , is relegated to a minor role , and diffusion through caveola / vesicle channels favoured as the principal transcellular transport route . In one careful serial section reconstruction in rat heart capillaries ( Bund - gaard et al . 1983 ) , the entire population of apparently free plasmalemmal vesicles was identified as belonging to racemose invaginations or caveolae that , instead of forming channels across the cell , all terminated within Caveolae 343 it . On these grounds it was argued that there was no evidence whatsoever that endothelial transport is me - diated by vesicles , caveolae or channels . The apparent transport of macromolecules from the luminal to ablu - minal surface , which originally inspired the develop - ment of the transcytosis theory , could , it was suggested ( Bundgaard , 1980 ) , be plausibly explained by diffusion of the macromolecule tracers initially into the luminal caveolar chains ( where in sectional view they would often appear as if in free vesicles ) , and then , after passage via the paracellular pathway , entry into caveo - lae on the abluminal side ( which would give the impression of vesicle discharge ) . Following this idea to its conclusion , endothelial caveolae would be envisaged as sessile structures of undetermined function ( Bundgaard et al . 1983 ; Fr0kjaer - jensen , 1984 ) , more elaborate in structure but otherwise similar to those envisaged in muscle . In the same vein , a few studies on muscle have ignored prevailing opinion and continued to discuss muscle caveolae as a dynamic vesicle system rather than as semi - permanent imaginations ( Pollack , 1977 ; Piper et al . 1984 ; Schwartzes al . 1984 ) . Thus , a minority view for each cell type effectively transposes the established concepts of muscle and endothelial caveolae . Ultrarapid freezing and the examination of cells without chemical fixation A central flaw in the formulation of all these interpret - ations of caveola—vesicle functional relationships has been their dependence on glutaraldehyde to preserve instantly , in its native configuration , a lipid - rich , potentially labile membrane system . Membrane lipids are , however , only poorly stabilized by glutaraldehyde ( e . g . see Jost et al . 1973 ; Glauert , 1975 ) , and even gross movements of intracellular organelles can con - tinue for many seconds after exposure of cultured cells to the fixative ( Buckley , 1973 ) . The advent of ultra - rapid freezing techniques ( Dempsey & Bullivant , 1976 ; Heuser et al . 1979 ; Muller et al . 1980 ) and their increasing application to the examination of unfixed cells in the 1980s , led to re - appraisal of a series of membrane - related phenomena ( e . g . see Chandler & Heuser , 1979 ; Kachar & Reese , 1982 ; Green & Severs , 1984 ) , bringing to the forefront fears that glutaralde - hyde fixation had often given a false picture of mem - brane structure and dynamic events in the past . This problem had not surfaced earlier because examination of unfixed specimens had only occasionally been attempted by conventional freezing methods as rou - tinely practised for freeze - fracture throughout the 1970s . With few exceptions , conventional freezing necessitates treatment of the specimen with a cryopro - tectant ( glycerol ) to prevent distortion of cell structure by ice crystals , and this is routinely preceded by treatment with glutaraldehyde to try and minimize cryoprotectant - induced artifacts . The essence of ultra - rapid freezing is to improve the cooling rate of the specimen sufficiently for ice - crystal damage to be avoided , even in the absence of prior cryoprotectant treatment , and this then renders the glutaraldehyde fixation step unnecessary . In this way , the hope of capturing cells and their dynamic membrane events by the physical process of freezing , without ice - crystal damage , in a state close to that existing / ; ; vivo , becomes a practical possibility . Caveolae In directly frozen endothelial cells When directly frozen endothelial cells were first exam - ined by freeze - fracture and thin - section ( after freeze - substitution ) methods , the existence of both caveolae in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3A ) and apparently free vesicles in the cytoplasm was confirmed ( Dempsey et al . 1973 ; Mazzone & Kornblau , 1981 ; Severs & Green , 1983a ) . However , by quantitative analysis after ultra - rapid freezing in two endothelial cell types ( rat thoracic aorta , McGuire & Twietmeyer , 1983 ; rete mirabile of the eel swim bladder , Wagner & Andrews , 1985 ) , the number of caveolae after glutaraldehyde fixation was found to be about threefold higher than that of unfixed cells . This discrepancy was attributed to glutaralde - hyde - induced fusion of free cytoplasmic vesicles with the plasma membrane ; an idea first discussed in an earlier investigation of surface vesicles in convention - ally frozen ( fixed and unfixed ) fibroblasts ( Bretscher & Whytock , 1977 ) . If , in reality , endothelial cells have significantly fewer caveolae than originally thought , it might be assumed that the number of free vesicles is correspondingly higher , shifting the balance in favour of vesicle transcytosis rather than caveolar channel diffusion as the principal or exclusive mechanism of transendothelial transport . However , the potential for vesicular transport implied by the apparent abundance of vesicles in fixed cells may also be misleading ; glutaraldehyde - fixed endothelial cells , according to some reports , contain substantially more vesicles than do unfixed freeze - substituted cells from the same vessel ( Mazzone & Kornblau , 1981 ; Robinson et al . 1984 ; Wagner & Andrews , 1985 ) . If , as supposed , glutaralde - hyde depletes the free vesicle population to increase artifactually the number of caveolae , then there must be further mechanisms by which it generates additional vesicles . In the rete mirabile , the explanation seems to be that the fixative causes cisternal membranes to fragment and minivesicles to fuse together ( Wagner & Andrews , 1985 ) , but whether this mechanism operates in other endothelia is unknown . Another possibility suggested from a study on cultured endothelial cells 344 A ' , jf . Severs ' : - > KA - - . f r • * > • 3A Fig . 3 . Freeze - fracture views of unfixed , directly frozen endothelial plasma membrane ( A ) and cardiac muscle plasma membrane ( B ) . For A , a spermatic artery was mounted between two thin copper holders in situ in a living ( anaesthetized ) rat , and frozen within 2s of excision by plunging into propane ( Severs & Green , 1983n ) . Note variation in the degree of invagination of caveolae , suggesting different stages in vesicle formation or fusion . Fig . 3B is from a heart that was beating in an anaesthetized rat until the instant it was frozen by the impact of a cold copper block ( Severs & Green , 19836 ) . The sparsity of caveolae results in large tracts of membrane in which no caveolar openings are seen ( cf . Fig . 2A ) .

Caveolae 345 ( Robinson et al . 1984 ) is that glutaraldehyde induces inward blebbing of the plasma membrane - a mechan - ism that could , at the same time , account for the elevated numbers of caveolae . In view of the lessons learnt from three - dimensional reconstruction in fixed specimens , it is clearly of importance to establish what proportion of the apparently free vesicle popu - lation in directly frozen specimens in fact belongs to caveola - vesicle chains . The surprising conclusion reached from examination of rapidly frozen freeze - substituted frog mesentery and rat skeletal muscle capillaries ( Fr0kjaer - Jensen & Reese , 1986 ; Noguchief al . 1986 ) is that , as in fixed specimens , truly free vesicles are rare , but chains of fused vesicles , some of which connect via caveolae to the cell surface , are common . One possible explanation for these seemingly contradictory findings is that owing to intrinsic differ - ences in the proportions of caveolae and free vesicles , not all endothelia respond to chemical fixation in the same way ; the native configuration of the caveola - vesicle system may thus be more faithfully preserved in some than in others . Caveolae in directly frozen muscle cells All these new findings on endothelial vesicle - caveola functional relationships , however incomplete , raise some interesting questions as to the nature and func - tion of muscle caveolae . If , in endothelial cells , glutar - aldehyde fixation can induce fusion of free subplasma - lemmal vesicles with the plasma membrane , could not the same happen in muscle cells ? If it did , the idea of muscle caveolae as part of an endocytotic or exocytotic vesicle system would not , after all , be quite so implau - sible . Alternatively , if glutaraldehyde can induce in - ward blebbing of the plasma membrane , most or even the entire population of muscle caveolae could be artifactual . Either way , a fresh look at the status of muscle caveolae as specialized semi - permanent invagi - nated domains and their reality in vivo is called for . In skeletal muscle fibres , the first indications were that unfixed ultrarapid - frozen specimens have mark - edly fewer ( and smaller ) caveolae than do fixed speci - mens ( Lee et al . 1983 ) . When the same trend was reported in a recent study on cardiac muscle ( Frank et al . 1987 ) , with which our own unpublished obser - vations agree ( Fig . 3B ) , a consistent pattern across muscle types seemed to be emerging . This hope was , however , dashed with the publication in 1987 of a careful and detailed study by Poulos et al . ( 1986 ) . They found that caveola number in intact ultrarapid - frozen skeletal muscle fibres did not differ from that observed after glutaraldehyde fixation , and was , moreover , unchanged by brief or prolonged ( neuromuscular blocking agent - induced ) rest , brief or prolonged electrical stimulation , stretch ( within the normal physiological range ) or careful compression cutting . However , the number and size of caveolae were greatly reduced after mechanical damage , i . e . when myofibres were laterally sheared or torn during preparation for ultrarapid freezing , and it is to this that the earlier discordant results on human skeletal muscle reported by the same group ( Lee et al . 1983 ) are now attributed . The findings of Poulos et al . ( 1986 ) bring renewed support to the concept of muscle caveolae as long - lived specialized invaginations of the plasma membrane , but again , further questions are posed . Why , after direct freezing of unfixed cardiac muscle , is a reduced num - ber of caveolae observed ? Although mechanical damage and / or time - related changes during specimen preparation ( Severs & Green , 1983a ; Poulos et al . 1986 ) might seem the obvious explanation , the study by Frank et al . ( 1987 ) minimized these by using entire papillary muscles , which were excised and mounted in a physiological medium and then frozen within 30 s . Moreover , the example illustrated in Fig . 3B comes from a heart that was beating in situ in the living animal until the very instant it was frozen by impact of a cold copper block ( Severs & Green , 19836 ) . It seems improbable that caveolae in cardiac muscle could differ fundamentally from those in skeletal muscle , yet that is what these preliminary results suggest . Further work using techniques designed to reduce or eliminate specimen manipulation and preparation time before ultrarapid freezing ( e . g . see Severs & Green , 1983a , b ) is still needed to confirm these findings . How else can the function and properties of muscle caveolae now be best explored ? The isolation of caveolae from plasma membrane does not seem feasible at present but recent advances in cytochemistry offer new opportunities for determining the chemical make - up of the caveolar membrane . Further investigation of some of the physiological conditions that alter caveola number ( e . g . anoxia , myocyte dissociation and culture conditions ) might also prove worthwhile . For the moment , how - ever , the function of muscle caveolae still seems as elusive as ever .
