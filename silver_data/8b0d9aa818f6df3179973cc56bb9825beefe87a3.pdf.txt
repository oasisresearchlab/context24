Here we show thatdown - regulation of Wt1 could induce podocyte dysfunction and apoptosis throughac - 19 tivating Wnt / β - catenin signaling . Podocytes treated with adriamycin demonstrated decreased expression of 20 Wt1 , coupled with activated Wnt / β - catenin signaling in vitro . Reduced expression of Wt1 in podocytes 21 transfected with Wt1 siRNA is correlated with activated Wnt / β - catenin signaling , increased podocyte apoptosis , 22 as well as suppressed expression of nephrin . Blockade of Wnt / β - catenin signaling with Dickkopf - 1 ameliorated 23 podocyte injury and apoptosis induced by Wt1 siRNA . We also found that membrane LRP6 was increased dra - 24 matically in podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA compared with control siRNA , while no signi ﬁ cant change 25 was found in total LRP6 . Caveolin - and clathrin - dependent endocytosis were both involved in the regulation of 26 β - catenin signaling . And we found that down - regulation of Wt1 in podocytes mediates activation of Wnt / β - 27 catenin signaling by recruiting LRP6 to the caveolin - mediated endocytosis route , thereby sequestering it from 28 clathrin - dependent endocytosis . As a result , we concluded that Wt1 expression levels in podocytes regulate 29 Wnt / β - catenin signaling through modulating the endocytic fate of LRP6 , and this indicates a potential target 30 for the therapy of CKD . 31 © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc . 3233 34 35 36 1 . Introduction 37 Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , one of the leading factors determin - 38 inghuman morbidity and mortality , has becomea common problem af - 39 fecting human health , and it will inevitably progress into end - stage 40 renal disease when renal replacement therapy including hemodialysis 41 and peritoneal dialysis is necessary [ 1 ] . The prevalence and incidence 42 of CKD have also posed an enormous challenge for health resources 43 worldwide [ 2 , 3 ] . As a result , it is increasingly important that we must 44 study the kidney , not just as they develop , but also as they age and re - 45 spond to injurious stimuli . 46 Glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier is essential for the maintenance of nor - 47 mal renal function , and it is composed of three layers : the fenestrated 48 glomerular endothelial cells , podocytes , and glomerular basement 49 membrane [ 4 ] . Increasingevidenceindicates thatpodocytedysfunction , 50 described as foot process effacement and podocyte depletion , play crit - 51 ical roles in the pathogenesis of CKD [ 5 – 7 ] . However , the molecular 52 mechanisms underlying podocyte dysfunction remain poorly under - 53 stood . Besides , podocytes are highly differentiated and specialized 54 cells with few ability to regenerate [ 8 ] . Hence , it is of great signi ﬁ cance 55 to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying podocyte dysfunction , 56 thus providing new targets for the therapy of CKD . 57 Wnt / β - catenin signaling , also called canonical Wnt signaling , was 58 ﬁ rst discovered in Drosophila . It is a conserved signaling pathway and 59 involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes ranging 60 from embryogenesis to development of disease [ 9 – 11 ] . Over the years , 61 Wnt / β - catenin signaling is getting more and more attention in the 62 ﬁ eld of nephrology as a result of its effects in kidney development and 63 renal injury . Reportedly , activated Wnt / β - catenin signaling could in - 64 duce podocyte dysfunction and proteinuria [ 12 – 14 ] . 65 The human Wnt gene encodes a large family of ligand molecules 66 composed of 19 secreted lipid - modi ﬁ ed proteins . Upon binding to the 67 cell membrane receptor Frizzled and its co - receptors LRP5 / 6 ( LRP , low 68 density lipoprotein receptor - related protein ) , Wnts induce a series of 69 downstream gene expression . In the absence of Wnt ligand , β - catenin 70 is phosphorylated by binding to a multiprotein complex consisting of 71 the scaffold proteins axis inhibition protein ( Axin ) , the tumor suppres - 72 sor adenomatosis polyposis coli ( APC ) , and glycogen synthase kinase - Cellular Signalling xxx ( 2015 ) xxx – xxx Abbreviations : CKD , Chronickidneydisease ; LRP , Lowdensitylipoproteinreceptor - relatedprotein ; Axin , Axisinhibitionprotein ; APC , Adenomatosispolyposiscoli ; GSK - 3 β , Glycogensynthasekinase - 3 β ; TCF / LEF , T - cellfactor / lymphocyteenhancerfactor ; Wt1 , Wilms ' tumorsuppressorgene ; ADR , Adriamycin ; MDC , Monodansyl - cadaverine . ⁎ Correspondingauthorat : DepartmentofNephrology , ShanghaiFirstPeople ' sHospital , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai , People ' s Republic of China , 100 HaiNing Road , Shanghai 200080 , People ' s Republic of China .

Phosphorylated β - catenin can be easily degraded by 74 proteasome , thusblockingdownstreamgeneexpression . Withthepres - 75 ence of Wnt ligand , β - catenin is stabilized , accumulated in the cyto - 76 plasm , translocated into nucleus and interacted with T - cell factor / 77 lymphocyte enhancer factor ( TCF / LEF ) to induce Wnt responsive gene 78 expression [ 15 – 17 ] . As a result , β - catenin , especially active β - catenin 79 ( or unphosphorylated β - catenin ) , could be regarded as a switch con - 80 trolling “ on and off ” of Wnt / β - catenin signaling . 81 The Wilms ' tumor suppressor gene ( Wt1 ) , well - known for its role 82 in Wilms ' tumor , is essential for kidney development . Wt1 knocked - 83 out mice have no kidney because the nephric duct fail to grow out 84 and apoptosis of the metanephric blastema [ 18 , 19 ] . Wt1 mutations 85 is also reported to be involved in the development of glomerular dis - 86 ease in human and mice [ 20 , 21 ] . In the glomerular of adult kidney , 87 Wt1 expression is limited to podocytes , and it has long been used 88 as a marker for the location of podocytes [ 22 ] . However , the role of 89 Wt1 and its mechanisms in the maintenance of podocyte biology is 90 poorly understood . Reportedly , mutations in Wt1 and consequent 91 activation of Wnt / β - catenin signaling have been found in the devel - 92 opment of Wilms ' tumor [ 23 , 24 ] . We suppose that reduced expres - 93 sion of Wt1 in podocytes after injurious stimuli may induce 94 podocyte dysfunction through activating Wnt / β - catenin signaling . 95 As a result , our study is designed aiming to explore the effect of 96 down - regulation of Wt1 in podocyte dysfunction and its related 97 mechanism . 98 In the current study , we demonstrated that down - regulation of Wt1 99 could activate Wnt / β - catenin signaling , induce podocyte dysfunction 100 and apoptosis . We also found that loss of Wt1 not only mediated inter - 101 nalization of LRP6 based on increased membrane LRP6 expression in 102 podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA but also activates Wnt / β - 103 catenin signalingby recruitingLRP6 to thecaveolin - mediated endocytic 104 route , thus sequestering it from clathrin - dependent endocytosis . In de - 105 tail , with the presence of Wt1 , LRP6 interacts with clathrin , while in the 106 absenceofWt1 , LRP6issequesteredbycaveolin . Collectively , ourresults 107 suggest that down - regulation of Wt1 in podocytes regulate Wnt / β - 108 catenin signaling through modulating the endocytic fate of LRP6 , and 109 this indicates a potential target for the therapy of CKD . 110 2 . Materials and methods 111 2 . 1 . Cell culture and treatment 112 The conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cells ( MPCs ) were 113 kindly provided by Dr . Peter Mundel ( Mount Sinai School of Medicine , 114 New York , NY ) , as described previously [ 25 ] . MPCs were cultured at 115 33 °C for propagation in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % 116 FBS and 10 U / mL recombinant mouse IFN - r . To induce differentiation , 117 MPCs were then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 118 10 % FBS at 37 °C in the absence of IFN - r . Differentiated podocytes 119 were treated with adriamycin ( ADR ) at different timepointswithdiffer - 120 ent dosages as indicated . In order to inhibit Wnt / β - catenin signaling 121 in vitro , podocytes were also treated with recombinant mouse DKK1 122 protein as indicated . 123 2 . 2 . Western blotting analysis 124 Cultured mouse podocytes were lysed in RIPA buffer . Proteins were 125 separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophore - 126 sis ( SDS – PAGE ) , andthenelectrophoreticallytransferred toanitrocellu - 127 lose membrane ( Millipore ) . Membrane protein was extracted using the 128 Membrane and Cytosol Protein Extraction Kit ( Beyotime technology , 129 Shanghai , China ) .

RNA extraction and real - time RT - PCR 140 For the analysis of mRNA relative expression levels , total RNA 141 were isolated , and RT - PCR were carried out based on routine proce - 142 dures . Brie ﬂ y , ﬁ rst - strand cDNA was synthesized using a reverse 143 transcription system kit based on the instructions of the manufactur - 144 er ( Thermo ) . Real - time RT - PCR was performed on ABI Prism 7300 , 145 and quanti ﬁ cation of relative mRNA levels was calculated using the 146 2 − △△ Ct method . Sequences of the primers were as follows : Wt1 , 5 ′ - 147 CTA - CCA - TCC - GCA - ACC - AAG - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - GGG - TCC - TCG - 148 TGT - TTG - AAG - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; β - catenin , 5 ′ - TCA - CGC - AAG - AGC - 149 AAG - TAG - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - CTG - GAC - ATT - AGT - GGG - ATG - AG - 3 ′ 150 ( antisense ) ; Nephrin , 5 ′ - GGA - CCC - ACA - CTA - CTA - CTC - 3 ′ ( sense ) 151 and 5 ′ - CTC - TCC - ACC - TCG - TCA - TAC - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; LRP6 , 5 ′ - TCC - 152 TGG - TCT - TCC - ACT - CTT - C - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - GGT - CCT - GTT - GTC - 153 AGC - ATT - C - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; PAI - 1 , 5 ′ - TTA - CTG - GGT - GAG - TCA - GAG - 154 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - GGC - CTG - CTA - GGA - AAT - TAC - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; 155 Snail , 5 ′ - TTT - GCT - GAC - CGC - TCC - AAC - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - GGG - TAC - 156 AAA - GGC - ACT - CCA - TCA - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; GAPDH , 5 ′ - ATC - ACT - GCC - 157 ACC - CAG - AAG - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - TCC - ACG - ACG - GAC - ACA - TTG - 3 ′ 158 ( antisense ) . 159 2 . 4 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining 160 Podocytes cultured on glass slides were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformalde - 161 hyde for 15 minutes at room temperature and washed with PBS con - 162 taining 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , then these slides were blocked with 5 % 163 bovine serum albumin for 2 hours at room temperature . The prepared 164 slides were stained with LRP6 antibody overnight at 4 °C ( anti - LRP6 , 165 sc - 25317 , Santa cruz ) . After washing , the slides were then stained 166 with FITC - conjugated secondary antibody ( Beyotime biotechnology ) . 167 Slides were visualized using microscopy ( Olympus CX 41 ) , and 168 photographed with a digital camera ( Nikon D5100 ) . 169 2 . 5 .

ThesequenceofmouseWt1siRNAwas5 ′ - GGC - GAU - UGU - UAA - 172 AGC - UCA - UUU - 3 ′ , and the control siRNA was 5 ′ - UUG - UAC - UAC - ACA - 173 AAA - GUA - CUG - 3 ′ . A total of about 5 × 105 cells were seeded into each 174 well of a six - well cell culture plate . And the Wt1 , siRNA and control 175 siRNA were transfected into podocytes by Lipofectamine 2000 transfec - 176 tion reagent following the instructions ( Invitrogen ) . 177 2 . 6 . Immunoprecipitation 178 Immunoprecipitation was used to study whether LRP6 was inter - 179 nalized through the caveolin - or clathrin - dependent endocytosis 180 when Wt1 was down - regulated in podocytes . Cell lysates were 181 immunoprecipitated with anti - Caveolin - 1 ( 3267 , CST ) , anti - 182 Clathrin ( 4796 , CST ) , and protein A / G plus agarose ( sc - 2003 , Santa 183 cruz ) .

Wt1 is down - regulated in podocytes treated with adriamycin ( ADR ) 193 We ﬁ rst examined the expression of Wt1 in podocytes treated with 194 ADR , whichiswidelyusedforinducingpodocytedysfunction [ 27 , 28 ] . As 195 shown in Fig . 1A and B , Western blotting showed that Wt1 was reduced 196 dramatically in a time - and dosage - dependent manner after treated 197 with ADR . The level of Wt1 mRNA after ADR treatment is presented in 198 Fig . 1C . These data indicated both the mRNA and protein levels of Wt1 199 were decreased gradually based on the dosage and duration of ADR . 200 To examine the pathological consequence of loss of Wt1 in podocytes , 201 we next investigated the expression of active β - catenin , the critical 202 downstream effector of Wnt / β - catenin signaling , at different time 203 points as described above by Western blotting analysis . Active β - 204 catenin was increased gradually in a time - and dosage - dependent man - 205 ner as well ( Fig . 1D and E ) . Taken together , these data suggested that 206 Wt1 is reduced in podocytes treated with ADR , and ADR could increase 207 the expression of active β - catenin as well . 208 3 . 2 . Wnt / β - catenin signaling is activated in podocytes treated with ADR 209 As described above , we found that Wt1 was reduced in podocytes 210 treated with ADR , coupled with increased expression of active β - 211 catenin in a time - and dosage - dependent manner . To con ﬁ rm the acti - 212 vation of Wnt / β - catenin signaling in podocyte injury induced by ADR , 213 we then examined its target genes expression with real - time RT - PCR 214 and Western blotting . We found that besides over - expressed active β - 215 catenin , PAI - 1 [ 29 ] and Snail [ 30 ] , both of which were target genes for 216 Wnt / β - catenin signaling , were increased signi ﬁ cantly in podocytes 217 treated with ADR compared with control , while no difference in β - 218 catenin was found ( Fig . 2A ) . 219 To ascertain the role of Wnt / β - catenin signaling in the pathogenesis 220 of podocyte dysfunction induced by ADR , we next blocked Wnt / β - 221 catenin signaling in cultured podocytes with Wnt antagonist , DKK1 , a 222 unique blocker of Wnt / β - catenin signaling because of its ability to 223 bind to LRP5 / 6 co - receptor [ 31 ] . Then podocytes were treated with 224 ADR and recombinant mouse DKK1 protein as indicated . As demon - 225 strated in Fig . 2A , incubation with DKK1 signi ﬁ cantly inhibited the in - 226 crease of active β - catenin protein , together with reduced expression 227 of PAI - 1and Snail , andnosigni ﬁ cantchangewasfound in β - catenin . Be - 228 sides , podocyte injury as de ﬁ ned by reduced nephrin expression when 229 treated with ADR was ameliorated after treatment with DKK1 230 ( Fig . 2A ) . This suggested the involvement of activated Wnt / β - catenin 231 signaling in podocyte dysfunction , and we suppose decrease of Wt1 232 when treated with ADR may play an essential role in the activation of 233 Wnt / β - catenin signaling . 234 We also explored apoptosis in podocytes treated with ADR , or re - 235 combinant mouse DKK1 protein by Annexin V / PI staining - based FACS 236 analysis . Treatment with ADR lead to signi ﬁ cantapoptosis in podocytes , 237 and apoptosis induced by ADR in podocytes could be inhibited by DKK1 238 ( Fig . 2B ) . 239 3 . 3 . Down - regulation of Wt1 activates Wnt / β - catenin signaling in 240 podocytes cultured in vitro 241 To identify the potential correlation between Wt1 and Wnt / β - 242 catenin signaling , Wt1 expression in podocytes was down - regulated 243 by Wt1 siRNA , then the expression of Wnt / β - catenin signaling was Fig . 1 .

Western blotting and real - time RT - PCR were used to detect 245 Wt1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in podocytes 246 transfected with Wt1 siRNA to evaluate transfection ef ﬁ ciency . And 247 the transfection ef ﬁ ciency was about 70 % ( Fig . 3A and B ) . We found 248 that Wt1 knockdown could activate Wnt / β - catenin signaling in 249 podocytes cultured in vitro . As shown in Fig . 3C – G , active β - catenin , 250 the principal downstream effector of Wnt / β - catenin signaling , was in - 251 creased signi ﬁ cantly when Wt1 was knocked down by Wt1 siRNA , to - 252 gether with over - expressed PAI - 1 and Snail both at mRNA and protein 253 levels , both of which were target genes for canonical Wnt signaling . 254 We did not ﬁ nd any change in β - catenin at mRNA and protein levels 255 in podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNAcompared with control siRNA . 256 To con ﬁ rm the effect of activated Wnt / β - catenin signaling in 257 podocyte dysfunction induced by Wt1 siRNA , we next treated 258 podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA with recombinant mouse 259 DKK1 protein , a unique inhibitor of Wnt / β - catenin signaling as de - 260 scribed above . As shown in Fig . 3C and D – G , podocytes transfected 261 with Wt1 siRNA were treated with DKK1 as indicated . And we found 262 that increase in the expression of active β - catenin , PAI - 1 and Snail 263 both at mRNA and protein levels in podocytes transfected with Wt1 264 siRNA were blocked by DKK1 . 265 3 . 4 . Wt1 knockdown suppress nephrin expression and induce podocyte 266 apoptosis 267 To explore the role of Wt1 in the maintenance of podocyte structure 268 and function , we examined podocyte apoptosis , nephrin expression in 269 podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA . We found that nephrin , the 270 podocyte - speci ﬁ c protein , was dramatically reduced at mRNA and pro - 271 tein levels in podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA , and incubation 272 with DKK1 signi ﬁ cantly restored nephrin expression ( Fig . 3C and E ) . 273 It is well - known that caspase activation mediates the apoptosis sig - 274 naling pathway . As a result , we next detected the expression of certain 275 pro - apoptotic and anti - apoptotic proteins , cleaved caspase - 3 , caspase - 276 3 , bcl - 2 by Western blotting to further explore the effect of Wt1 knock - 277 down on apoptosis in podocytes . As shown in Fig . 4A , Wt1 knockdown 278 signi ﬁ cantlyinducedtheactivationofcaspase - 3 , resultinginanincrease 279 in the level of cleaved caspase - 3 , and the expression of Bcl - 2 was 280 suppressed . DKK1 could inhibit the over - expression of cleaved 281 caspase - 3 and increase the expression of Bcl - 2 in podocytes transfected 282 with Wt1 siRNA compared with control groups . 283 We also assessed the effect of Wt1 down - regulation in podocytes 284 transfected with sequence targeting Wt1 ( Wt1 siRNA ) or control 285 siRNA by Annexin V / PI stainingFACSanalysis . Our results demonstrated 286 that knockdown of Wt1 with Wt1 siRNA resulted in signi ﬁ cant increase 287 of apoptosis in podocytes , and induced apoptosis was not observed in 288 cells transfected with control siRNA . The increase in podocyte apoptosis 289 as a result of reduced expression of Wt1 was blocked by DKK1 ( Fig . 4B ) . 290 These results demonstrated that down - regulation of Wt1 could induce 291 podocyte apoptosis by activating Wnt / β - catenin signaling . 292 3 . 5 . Down - regulation of Wt1 increase membrane expression of LRP6 in 293 podocytes cultured in vitro 294 We next studied the mechanism underlying down - regulation of 295 Wt1 induced activation of canonical Wnt signaling . As shown in 296 Fig . 5A and D , membrane expression of LRP6 protein was increased ob - 297 viously in podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA , and this increase 298 could be inhibited by DKK1 . We did not detect any signi ﬁ cant change 299 in the expression of total LRP6 protein as well as LRP6 mRNA ( Fig . 5A , 300 B and C ) . Furthermore , with the help of immuno ﬂ uorescence staining , 301 as shown in Fig . 5E , membrane LRP6 expression was increased in 302 podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA compared with control siRNA 303 transfected group . Reportedly , caveolin - and clathrin - mediated endocy - 304 tosis could respectively intervene the internalization of LRP6 to activate 305 or inhibit Wnt / β - catenin signaling [ 32 ] . As a result , we suppose that re - 306 duced expression of Wt1 activates Wnt / β - catenin signaling through 307 regulating endocytic route of LRP6 in the following part . 308 3 . 6 . Caveolin - mediated endocytosis is essential for activation of 309 Wnt / β - catenin signaling when Wt1 is reduced in podocytes 310 To evaluate the role of endocytosis in down - regulation of Wt1 - 311 mediated activation of Wnt / β - catenin signaling , we treated 312 podocytes with monodansyl - cadaverine ( MDC ) , a special inhibitor 313 of clathrin - dependent endocytosis , or nystatin , known to disrupt Fig . 2 .

The results demonstrated 316 that nystatin , rather than MDC , could inhibit activation of Wnt / β - 317 catenin signaling when Wt1 is reduced in podocytes . As shown in 318 Fig . 6A , nystatin suppressed the increased expression of active β - 319 catenin protein in podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA , and ex - 320 pression of PAI - 1 and Snail were both inhibited in podocytes 321 transfected with Wt1 siRNA after treated with nystatin , together 322 with reduced membrane LRP6 expression . We also found that MDC 323 could induce the expression of active β - catenin protein as well as 324 β - catenin signaling targeted genes , PAI - 1 and Snail , in both the 325 Wt1 siRNA transfected group and control group , coupled with in - 326 creased expression of membrane LRP6 ( Fig . 6B ) . Moreover , we also 327 found that dynasore , known to inhibit both the caveolin - mediated 328 endocytosis and clathrin - dependent endocytosis , induce activation 329 of β - catenin signaling in podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA 330 compared with control siRNA ( Fig . 6C ) . Based on the results de - 331 scribed above , we suppose that clathrin - dependent endocytosis 332 may play dominant roles in normal podocytes with the presence of 333 Wt1 . 334 In order to further testify the endocytic route mediating inter - 335 nalization of LRP6 when Wt1 is reduced in podocytes , co - 336 immunoprecipitation was applied . And we found that LRP6 mainly 337 interacts with clathrin rather than Caveolin - 1 in the normal 338 podocytes , and when Wt1 was down - regulated in podocytes 339 transfected with Wt1 siRNA , LRP6 mainly interacts with Caveolin - 340 1 , accompanied by few interaction with clathrin . As a result , we 341 speculated that activation of Wnt / β - catenin signaling in podocytes 342 transfected with Wt1 siRNA is dependent on caveolin - mediated 343 endocytosis , and Wt1 , a marker used for location of podocytes in 344 the glomerular of adult kidney , selectively recruits LRP6 to the 345 clathrin - dependent endocytosis route , thereby sequestering it 346 from caveolin - dependent endocytosis . And when the expression 347 of Wt1 is down - regulated , LRP6 is internalized through caveolin - 348 dependent endocytic route . 349 4 . Discussion 350 The results presented in this study demonstrated that down - 351 regulation of Wt1 could lead to podocyte dysfunction and apoptosis 352 through activating Wnt / β - catenin signaling . We also found that mem - 353 brane expression of LRP6 protein was increased signi ﬁ cantly in 354 podocytes treated with Wt1 siRNA compared with control siRNA , 355 while nosigni ﬁ cant change wasfound in totalLRP6 , indicatinginternal - 356 izationofLRP6 mediateactivationofWnt / β - cateninsignaling . Caveolin - 357 and clathrin - dependent endocytosis are reported to be involved in 358 activating and inhibiting Wnt / β - catenin signaling , respectively [ 32 ] . 359 Based on this , our further research was performed , and the results indi - 360 cated that Wt1 selectively recruits LRP6 to the clathrin - dependent en - 361 docytosis route , thereby sequestering it from caveolin - dependent 362 endocytosis in normal podocytes . And when Wt1 expression level is 363 down - regulated , LRP6 is internalized through caveolin - dependent 364 endocytic route to activate β - catenin signaling . Severallines of evidence 365 supporting this conclusion were as follows . 366 First , Wt1 levels were reduced in podocytes treated with ADR , and 367 its expression was decreased gradually in a time - and dosage - depen - 368 dent manner . However , Zhou et al . [ 33 ] did not ﬁ nd any signi ﬁ cant 369 changes in the expression of Wt1 mRNA , though a dramatic loss of 370 Wt1 protein was found in ADR nephropathy models . Besides , active β - 371 catenin was increased gradually in a time - and dosage - dependent man - 372 ner as well . This indicates a potential negative correlation between Wt1 373 and β - catenin signaling . We then found that ADR could mediate Fig . 3 . Wnt / β - catenin signaling was activated in podocytes transfected with Wt1 siRNA in vitro . Mouse podocytes were transfected with Wt1 siRNA or control siRNA . At 48 hours after transfection , the level of Wt1 and Wnt signaling targeted genes such as active β - catenin , β - catenin , Nephrin , PAI - 1 , Snail mRNA , and protein were analyzed using Western blotting and real - time RT - PCR separately . And after transfection for 24 hours , cells were treated with DKK1 , which is a special inhibitor of Wnt / β - catenin signaling .

Combined with co - immunoprecipitation results , we found that , 390 with the presence of Wt1 , LRP6 interacts with clathrin , while in the ab - 391 sence of Wt1 , LRP6 is sequestered by caveolin . As a result , we speculated 392 that Wt1 , a marker used for location of podocytes in the glomerular of 393 mature kidney , selectively recruits LRP6 to the clathrin - dependent 394 endocytosis route , thereby sequestering it from caveolin - dependent en - 395 docytosis . And when Wt1 expression level is down - regulated , LRP6 is 396 internalized through caveolin - dependent endocytic route . 397 Mechanistic details of how reduced expression of Wt1 leads to β - 398 catenin stabilization and Wntresponsivegeneexpression are emerging , 399 and in 2010 , Kim et al . [ 34 ] found that Wt1 negatively regulates Wnt / β - 400 catenin signaling through modulating the expression of CXXC5 gene in 401 mammaliankidney development . Based on our research , we speculated 402 that internalization of LRP6 also plays critical roles in the activation of 403 Wnt / β - catenin signaling when Wt1 is down - regulated in podocytes . 404 Yamamoto et al . found that caveolin - dependent endocytosis is critical 405 fortheinternalizationofLRP6andactivationofWnt / β - cateninsignaling 406 [ 35 ] . And then in 2008 , they also found that caveolin - and clathrin - 407 dependent pathways were both able to induce internalization of LRP6 408 to activate or inhibit Wnt / β - catenin signaling , respectively [ 36 ] . Consis - 409 tent with our study , Soda et al . [ 37 ] . demonstrated calthrin - and 410 nonclathrin - mediated endocytosis play critical roles in podocyte health 411 and disease , and disruption of clathrin - dependent endocytosis leads to 412 severe proteinuria as well as foot process effacement in mouse models . 413 In conclusion , we demonstrated that Wt1 expression levels in 414 podocytes regulate Wnt / β - catenin signaling through modulating 415 whether LRP6 is internalized through the caveolin - or clathrin - depen - 416 dent endocytosis pathways . Although studies on the effects of endocy - 417 tosis in podocytes are still in its infancy , we believe that this pathway 418 plays crucial roles in podocyte biology and dysfunction . And this will 419 provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of CKD . 420 Con ﬂ ict of interest 421 All authors have read the journal ' s authorship agreement and policy 422 on con ﬂ ict of interest .
