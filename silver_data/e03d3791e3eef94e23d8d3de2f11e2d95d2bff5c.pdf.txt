ABSTRACTObjectives We investigated whether crowded workplaces , sharing surfaces and exposure to infections were factors associated with a positive test for influenza virus . Methods We studied 11 300 cases with a positive test for influenza A and 3671 cases of influenza B from Swedish registry of communicable diseases . Six controls for each case were selected from the population registry , with each control being assigned the index date of their corresponding case . We linked job histories to job - exposure matrices ( JEMs ) , to assess different transmission dimensions of influenza and risks for different occupations compared with occupations that the JEM classifies as low exposed . We used adjusted conditional logistic analyses to estimate the ORs for influenza with 95 % CI . Results The highest odds were for influenza were : regular contact with infected patients ( OR 1 . 64 , 95 % CI 1 . 54 to 1 . 73 ) ; never maintained social distance ( OR 1 . 51 , 95 % CI 1 . 43 to 1 . 59 ) ; frequently sharing materials / surfaces with the general public ( OR 1 . 41 , 95 % CI 1 . 34 to 1 . 48 ) ; close physical proximity ( OR 1 . 54 , 95 % CI 1 . 45 to 1 . 62 ) and high exposure to diseases or infections ( OR 1 . 54 , 95 % CI 1 . 44 to 1 . 64 ) . There were small differences between influenza A and influenza B . The five occupations with the highest odds as compared with low exposed occupations were : primary care physicians , protective service workers , elementary workers , medical and laboratory technicians , and taxi drivers . Conclusions Contact with infected patients , low social distance and sharing surfaces are dimensions that increase risk for influenza A and B . Further safety measures are needed to diminish viral transmission in these contexts . INTRODUCTION Influenza is major global health concern , and higher prevalence of influenza has been reported for settings such as healthcare clinics , prisons , day - care centres and schools . 1 Influenza can occur in pandemic waves , as was the case with the 2009 influenza pandemic caused by the A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 subtype , although there are also frequently occur - ring seasonal outbreaks . Influenza A is the dominant cause of seasonal epidemics , whereas the patho - genic character of influenza B is more endemic . 2 3 Influenza is transmitted via air particles from the mucous membranes of an infected person , by personal contact with an infectious person , or by contact with virus - contaminated surface . 4 Spreading of the virus via air over longer distances is less common . Workplace exposures may be of importance for the transmission risk of influenza , a phenomenon that has been shown for health - care workers ( HCWs ) and other occupations with frequent close contacts with other persons . 5 6 In a systematic review , HCWs seem to have an at least a doubled risk for influenza A ( H1N1 ) based on studies from the 2009 pandemic . 6 There are , however , published studies that do not show an increased risk for influenza A virus infection for HCWs . 7 – 9 Regarding influenza B viral infections , there are reports of smaller outbreaks in hospital settings . 2 3 10 In a Spanish case – control study , there was an increased risk for influenza A ( H1N1 ) infec - tion , defined as a positive reverse transcriptase PCR test in certain HCWs with presumed expo - sure to aerosol - generating procedures . 1 There was an increased risk for severe influenza ( hospitalised cases ) among manual workers , as compared with primary care cases ( as controls ) . 11 In a recent Danish study , the authors a priori selected 10 occupations that are considered to be at risk for hospitalisation due to influenza and compared then with ‘public WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC ⇒ The frequencies of influenza A and B infections vary across occupational groups . However , there is limited evidence regarding which workplace exposure factors are of importance in relation to an increased risk of infection . WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS ⇒ Contact with infected patients or the general public and short social distance were associated with increased likelihood of having positive test for influenza virus . Primary care physician was found to be the occupation with the highest odds of a positive test for influenza virus . HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH , PRACTICE OR POLICY ⇒ There is a need for further safety measures , such as extended vaccination programmes , to diminish viral transmission in workplaces that involve close physical contacts . 2 Torén K , et al . Occup Environ Med 2023 ; 0 : 1 – 7 . doi : 10 . 1136 / oemed - 2022 - 108755 Workplace administration’ as the reference group . 5 There was no separa - tion between influenza A and B infections . In the same study , an increase in the rate of hospitalisation due to influenza was found among workers in public transportation , followed by garbage and recycling workers and HCWs . These studies indicate that workers who are in close contact with either the general public or with infected patients can be at increased risk for influenza . In this context , studies that differentiate between infections with influenza A and B viruses and subtypes thereof are lacking . The ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic has focused attention on the possibility that the workplace is a key setting for the spread of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus . 12 – 15 Consequently , several job - exposure matrices ( JEMs ) have been developed to assess the risk of expo - sure to SARS - CoV - 2 . 16 17 These JEMs are based on categorisa - tion of different occupations according to workplace factors of interest , in this case factors assumed to be linked with risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . We assume that , in slightly modified forms , these matrices can also be applied to studying the risks for other viral infections , such as those with influenza A and B . 18 Thus , we hypothesised that in a working population , occu - pations involving close contacts with coworkers or the general public would be associated with increased odds for influenza . To study this , we apply JEMs matrices that have been developed to assess the risk of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 . 16 17 MATERIALS AND METHODS Establishment of study population The study population included all cases of influenza A or influ - enza B virus infection obtained through the system of manda - tory reporting of communicable diseases in Sweden , the SmiNet registry , as previously reported by us . 19 The cases eligible for inclusion were those in the age range of 19 – 64 years who had a reported positive test for influenza virus , that is , detection of viral ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) by PCR , ( N = 14 971 ) , including influenza A ( N = 11 300 ) and influenza B ( N = 3671 ) . We extracted from the SmiNet registry the Swedish personal identity number for each case and the date ( index date ) when the positive sample was obtained . We selected six living controls for each case , matched for gender , age ( case year of birth ) and region of residency at the index date from the Swedish Historical National Population Registry ( N = 66 216 ) . We limited the study to reports received between 1 July 2006 and 31 December 2019 . Here , ‘influenza’ is defined as a positive test for influenza virus . We extracted information from the Swedish national socioeco - nomic database , called LISA ( Longitudinal integration database for health insurance and labour market studies ) , regarding the highest educational level attained , categorised as : pre high school ( up to 9 years ) , completed high school , or university examination , and country of birth . From LISA , we also obtained information about the annual occupational history for the period of 2005 – 2019 . Comorbidities We used the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Registry and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Registry to identify the following comorbidities based on 10th revision of the International Classifi - cation of Diseases ( ICD - 10 ) codes : chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD , ICD10 J43 – J44 ) ; ischaemic heart disease ( IHD , ICD10 I20 – I25 ) ; and diabetes mellitus ( ICD E10 – E14 ) during the 5 years preceding the index date . We defined the use of oral and systemic corticosteroids according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) codes ( ATC H02 ) if these drugs were dispensed at any time within the 5 years preceding the index date . We also used the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Registry to inform on hospitalisation for any pneumonia , including any hospital stay that included the index date ±7 days . Among the cases , we identified a subset of ‘pneumonia with influenza’ , as influenza / viral pneumonia ( ICD 10 J09 – J12 ) . Classification of occupational exposures The occupation of the individual in the year preceding the index date was classified at the four - digit level according to the ISCO - 88 and ISCO - 08 codes . 20 21 We applied two previ - ously described JEMs to assess the risk of becoming infected with the SARS - CoV - 2 virus : a European JEM based on expert assessment performed during the COVID - 19 pandemic 16 and a Swedish JEM based on prepandemic US survey data obtained from the UK Office of National Statistics . 17 The European JEM was designed to capture eight dimensions that were judged to be important for the risk of being infected , divided into : low risk , elevated risk and high risk . All dimensions were compared with no risk—defined as home workers or not working with others . We used the Danish application of the European JEM , which we assumed was the application that would most likely reflect Swedish conditions . Thus , in this study , we applied five of the following categories of risk dimensions : 1 . Number of workers in close vicinity to each other . High risk : > 30 per day , elevated risk : 10 – 30 per day and low risk : < 10 / day . 2 . Nature of contacts . High risk : working in workspaces with regular contacts with suspected or diagnosed COVID - 19 ( for this application , infected patients ) , elevated risk , working with the general public and low risk : working in workspaces with coworkers only . 3 . Contaminated workspaces . High risk : frequently ( ≥10 times / day ) sharing materials / surfaces with the general public , medium risk : sometimes ( < 10 times / day ) sharing material or surfaces with the general public and low risk : frequently ( ≥10 times / day ) sharing materials or surfaces with cowork - ers , only . 4 . Location . High risk : working mostly inside ( > 4 hours / day ) , medium risk : working partly inside ( 1 – 4 hours / day ) and low risk : working mostly outside . 5 . Social distancing , that is , the possibility to maintain ≥1 m of social distance . High risk : can never be maintained , elevated risk : cannot always be maintained and low risk : can always be maintained . We also applied the Swedish JEM that mapped physical proximity and exposure to diseases or infections as previously described . 18 This JEM has standardised scores for each occupa - tional group , yielding scores in the range of 0 – 100 . Thus , the scale for physical proximity was as follows : 0—I do not work near other people ( > 30 m distance ) . 25—I work with others but not close proximity ( eg , private office ) . 50—I work in slightly close proximity ( eg , shared office ) to other persons . 75—I work in moderately close proximity ( at arm’s length ) to other persons . 100—I work in very close proximity ( near touching ) to other persons . The scale for daily exposure to diseases or infections at current workplace was as follows : 0—never . 25—at least once a year , but not every month . 50—at least once a month , but not every week . 75—at least once a week , but not daily . 3 Torén K , et al . Occup Environ Med 2023 ; 0 : 1 – 7 . doi : 10 . 1136 / oemed - 2022 - 108755 Workplace 100—daily . We present this as quartiles of the mean scores for each dimension . Statistical methods We used conditional logistic multivariable regression to calcu - late the odds for all influenza , influenza A and influenza B , asso - ciated with the JEM - defined categories of exposures tested as indicator variables . The basic model ( model 1 ) was only adjusted for matching strata ( ie , equivalent to adjusting for gender , age and geographical region and index date ) . The adjusted model ( model 2 ) included , in addition , education , country of birth , COPD , IHD , diabetes and dispensed corticosteroids . All the JEM - defined categories of exposures were tested in separate models for each exposure . We also analysed the interactions with regard to gender . We used conditional logistic multivariable regression to calcu - late the odds for all influenza with pneumonia associated with the JEM - defined categories of exposures tested as indicator variables . Furthermore , we analysed the risk for all influenza in all occu - pations ( 4 - digit level ) using more than 50 persons with a posi - tive influenza virus test . The reference group in this analysis was defined as occupations classified as having the lowest level of potential exposure to influenza using the European and Swedish JEMs . 15 All occupations were tested in separate unconditional models for each exposure with adjustments for gender , age and geographical region . All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS V . 9 . 4 M7 software ( SAS ) , and 95 % CIs were calculated . RESULTS The study comprised 14 971 cases of influenza , whereof 11 300 were influenza A and 3671 were influenza B . Diabetes mellitus was a common comorbidity , seen in 5 . 5 % of the cases and 1 . 6 % of the controls . Use of corticosteroids was identified for 16 . 3 % of the cases and for 3 . 9 % of the controls . The prevalences of the occupational exposures are listed in table 1 . The most common dimension was working mostly inside , which accounted for 73 . 7 % of the cases and 69 . 7 % of the controls . Additional descriptive data are presented in table 1 . In the basic model , model 1 , the odds for influenza A were slightly higher than those for influenza B ( table 2 ) . When applying the European JEM , the highest odds were for influ - enza A and the dimensions of : regular contact with infected patients ( OR 1 . 67 , 95 % CI 1 . 55 to 1 . 77 ) ; never maintained social distance ( OR 1 . 54 , 95 % CI 1 . 45 to 1 . 63 ) and frequently sharing materials / surfaces with the general public ( OR 1 . 43 , 95 % CI 1 . 35 to 1 . 52 ) . This was in accordance with the Swedish JEM , which showed high odds in relation to the fourth quartile of Physical proximity ( OR 1 . 58 , 95 % CI 1 . 48 to 1 . 68 ) and the fourth quartile of exposure to diseases or infections ( OR 1 . 57 , 95 % CI 1 . 46 to 1 . 69 ) ( table 3 ) . Table 4 shows the odds from model 2 with additional adjust - ments compared with model 1 . The odds for influenza A are somewhat lower , although the dimensions of regular contact with infected patients ( OR 1 . 41 , 95 % CI 1 . 31 to 1 . 51 ) and the fourth quartile of exposure to diseases or infections ( OR 1 . 51 , 95 % CI 1 . 40 to 1 . 63 ) are still the highest estimates . The odds for influenza B are similar to influenza A , but somewhat lower . Online supplemental table S1 shows the different odds for all influenza for men and women . The estimates were quite similar , but mostly somewhat lower for women than for men . The odds for influenza with pneumonia were similar to the results for all influenza , with one exception ( online supple - mental table S2 ) . The odds for the fourth quartile of exposure to diseases or infections ( OR 1 . 05 , 95 % CI 0 . 94 to 1 . 18 ) was not increased , whereas that for regular contact with infected patients ( OR 1 . 28 , 95 % CI 1 . 17 to 1 . 41 ) was increased . Table 5 lists the odds for influenza all occupations with more than 50 cases , as compared with the unexposed control occupa - tions . The five occupations with the highest odds for influenza using model 1 were : primary care physicians ( OR 3 . 21 , 95 % CI 2 . 78 to 3 . 73 ) ; protective service workers ( OR 2 . 46 , 95 % CI 1 . 78 to 3 . 41 ) ; elementary workers not elsewhere classified ( OR 2 . 43 , 95 % CI 1 . 98 to 2 . 97 ) ; medical and laboratory technicians ( OR 2 . 31 , 95 % CI 1 . 69 to 3 . 15 ) and taxi drivers ( OR 1 . 95 , 95 % CI 1 . 54 to 2 . 45 ) . The five following occupations with high odds were : bus and tram drivers , home - based personal care workers , personal care workers , teachers’ aides and healthcare assistants . Elementary workers not elsewhere classified includes those who issue and collect parking or admission tickets , provide personal items to customers in cloakrooms and assist at enter - tainment events . DISCUSSION In this study with national coverage , we show that close contact with infected or diseased patients / persons and close physical proximity increase the odds of having a positive test for influenza virus . The observed pattern among the occupations supports the notion that contact with infected patients / persons and close proximity are important risk factors : primary care physicians , protective service workers , medical and laboratory technicians , taxi drivers , bus and tram drivers , home - based personal care Table 1 Characteristics of the cases with influenza and matched controls from the general population of Sweden in the age range 20 – 65 years in a national case – control study covering 1 July 2006 to 31 December 2019 Influenza ( N = 14 971 ) Controls ( N = 66 216 ) Men 44 . 1 % ( N = 6595 ) 43 . 8 % ( N = 29 001 ) Born in Sweden 73 . 7 % ( N = 11 035 ) 83 . 2 % ( N = 55 114 ) Post high school examination 39 . 7 % ( N = 5947 ) 43 . 9 % ( N = 5947 ) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease * 1 . 7 % ( N = 250 ) 0 . 1 % ( N = 82 ) Diabetes mellitus * 5 . 5 % ( N = 828 ) 1 . 6 % ( N = 1040 ) Ischaemic heart disease * 2 . 2 % ( N = 794 ) 0 . 7 % ( N = 458 ) Dispensed corticosteroids 16 . 3 % ( N = 2442 ) 3 . 9 % ( N = 2594 ) Occupational exposures or dimensions of transmission and mitigation factors No ; workers ( > 30 ) in close proximity to each other 30 . 6 % ( N = 4582 ) 26 . 8 % ( N = 17 722 ) Nature of contacts ; regular contacts with infected patients 21 . 5 % ( N = 3220 ) 16 . 3 % ( N = 10 804 ) Contaminated workspaces ; frequently sharing material / surfaces with general public 46 . 2 % ( N = 6924 ) 39 . 9 % ( N = 26 401 ) Location ; working mostly inside 73 . 7 % ( N = 11 041 ) 69 . 7 % ( N = 46 174 ) Social distancing ; Can never be maintained 30 . 2 % ( N = 4524 ) 24 . 3 % ( N = 16 103 ) Physical proximity ; work very close ( near touching ) to other persons† 30 . 6 % ( N = 4573 ) 24 . 2 % ( N = 16 015 ) Daily exposure to diseases or infections 9 . 9 % ( N = 1481 ) 7 . 6 % ( n = 1 481 ) * Hospital - based diagnoses . †Military personnel not included . 4 Torén K , et al . Occup Environ Med 2023 ; 0 : 1 – 7 . doi : 10 . 1136 / oemed - 2022 - 108755 Workplace workers , personal care workers , teachers’ aides and health - care assistants were the occupations with the highest odds for influenza . A major strength of our study design is that we use a national database with high coverage to assess the outcome of interest : influenza virus infection . The SmiNet registry provides compre - hensive coverage of all influenza tests , although we acknowledge that not all cases with positive virus detection will be captured . We also use the Swedish Inpatient Register , which is acknowl - edged to be of high quality . 22 Another strength of our study is that we employ random controls from the same national population . Furthermore , we were able to consider a number of key poten - tial confounders using Swedish registry data . These confounders include level of education ( as a proxy for socioeconomic status , SES ) and comorbidities that may modify the influenza risk , such as diabetes , COPD , IHD and dispensed corticosteroids . A key analytical strength of this study is our approach of categorising occupational exposure . It is generally acknowl - edged that the JEM approach avoids the recall bias inherent to respondent - elicited exposure histories . Furthermore , we limit the analyses to occupational exposures during the year preceding the diseased state , as we assume that this period is critical for increased risk . The Swedish JEM for proximity and exposure to diseases is based on prepandemic survey data collected in the USA . Noteworthy is that US military personnel were not included in these data . As military personnel make up a very small frac - tion of the Swedish working - age population , we consider that difference to be of minor importance . We do not include the dimension of face covering , which may have been used differ - ently during the pandemic period and our study period . In addi - tion , we do not include the dimensions of income insecurity or migrant background . The reason for this is twofold .

Second , we use the Danish application of the European JEM , and we consider that the Swedish and Danish labour markets are different with regard to migration and income security . The reason for using two different JEMs was a matter of validity ( external ) of the results . We think , as both JEMs , points towards social distancing and physical proximity as important risk factors , strengthen the validity of our results . Our study has a number of limitations . First , we do not control for influenza vaccination . However , in the group aged < 65 years , we assume that a low fraction of the individuals has been vaccinated . The official Swedish recommendation is that individuals aged > 65 years should be vaccinated , as well as indi - viduals with COPD , IHD , diabetes and compromised immunity ( www . folkhalsomyndigheten . se ) . In addition , HCWs are also recommended to be vaccinated , and especially in the healthcare sector , the staff may have been invited to receive free vaccina - tions for influenza . Another weakness is that we do not adjust for Table 4 Conditional logistic multivariable regression models of influenza A or influenza B matched for gender , age and geographical region , and adjusted for education , country of birth , COPD , IHD , diabetes and use of corticosteroids in relation to the different dimensions of transmission and mitigation factors ( model 2 ) in a national case – control study covering 1 July 2006 to 31 December 2019 Dimensions of transmission and mitigation factors Influenza A and influenza B ORs with 95 % CI Influenza A ( N = 11 300 ) Influenza B ( N = 3671 ) No of workers in close proximity to each other * < 10 per day 1 . 05 ( 0 . 99 to 1 . 12 ) 0 . 98 ( 0 . 88 to 1 . 10 ) 10 – 30 per day 1 . 14 ( 1 . 07 to 1 . 22 ) 1 . 17 ( 1 . 04 to 1 . 32 ) > 30 per day 1 . 28 ( 1 . 20 to 1 . 37 ) 1 . 22 ( 1 . 09 to 1 . 36 ) Nature of contacts * In workspaces with coworkers only 1 . 05 ( 0 . 99 to 1 . 12 ) 1 . 01 ( 0 . 90 to 1 . 12 ) In workspaces with general public 1 . 12 ( 1 . 05 to 1 . 20 ) 1 . 09 ( 0 . 97 to 1 . 21 ) Regular contacts with infected patients 1 . 41 ( 1 . 31 to 1 . 51 ) 1 . 37 ( 1 . 21 to 1 . 56 ) Contaminated workspaces * Frequently sharing material / surfaces with coworkers ( ≥10 times / day ) 1 . 08 ( 1 . 01 to 1 . 15 ) 1 . 03 ( 0 . 92 to 1 . 15 ) Sometimes sharing material / surfaces with general public ( < 10 times / day ) 1 . 06 ( 0 . 94 to 1 . 19 ) 1 . 06 ( 0 . 86 to 1 . 30 ) Frequently sharing materials / surfaces with general public ( ≥10 times / day ) 1 . 23 ( 1 . 16 to 1 . 31 ) 1 . 19 ( 1 . 07 to 1 . 32 ) Location * Mostly working outside 1 . 26 ( 1 . 02 to 1 . 55 ) 1 . 16 ( 0 . 79 to 1 . 69 ) Working partly inside 1 . 09 ( 0 . 98 to 1 . 21 ) 1 . 10 ( 0 . 91 to 1 . 32 ) Working mostly inside 1 . 16 ( 1 . 10 to 1 . 22 ) 1 . 11 ( 1 . 01 to 1 . 22 ) Social distancing * Always maintained 1 . 05 ( 0 . 97 to 1 . 14 ) 1 . 05 ( 0 . 98 to 1 . 14 ) Not always maintained 1 . 07 ( 0 . 98 to 1 . 16 ) 1 . 15 ( 1 . 06 to 1 . 25 ) Never maintained 1 . 40 ( 1 . 27 to 1 . 55 ) 1 . 26 ( 1 . 18 to 1 . 36 ) Physical proximity 3rd vs 2nd and 1st 1 . 11 ( 1 . 05 to 1 . 18 ) 0 . 99 ( 0 . 89 to 1 . 09 ) 4th vs 2nd and 1st 1 . 39 ( 1 . 30 to 1 . 49 ) 1 . 26 ( 1 . 12 to 1 . 41 ) Exposure to diseases or infections 2nd vs 1st 1 . 13 ( 1 . 06 to 1 . 20 ) 1 . 19 ( 1 . 08 to 1 . 32 ) 3rd vs 1st 1 . 17 ( 1 . 09 to 1 . 25 ) 1 . 17 ( 1 . 04 to 1 . 31 ) 4th vs 1st 1 . 51 ( 1 . 40 to 1 . 63 ) 1 . 42 ( 1 . 23 to 1 . 65 ) * Compared with homeworkers or working alone .

Occup Environ Med 2023 ; 0 : 1 – 7 . doi : 10 . 1136 / oemed - 2022 - 108755 Workplace household size . This may be a confounder , as large households have been associated with increased risk , and occupations at risk , such as taxi drivers and HCWs , may live in larger households . 8 We have adjusted for country of birth and SES , which to some extent take this bias into account . Another possible cofounder is the use of public transportation . A notable weakness of our study is the lack of data on smoking habits , in particular current tobacco use . Current smokers have a fivefold increased risk for laboratory - confirmed influenza , as compared with non - smokers . 23 In Sweden , the prevalence of current smoking in the age group 50 – 65 years is approximately 17 % . 24 Hence , smoking may be a potential confounder that is sufficiently common to explain the associations that we observed , if compared with others , current smokers were substantially more likely than never - smokers to work the exposed occupations . In a German study , HCWs had a higher prevalence of current smoking compared with non - HCW . 8 Of note , we have adjusted for both COPD and educational level , which may diminish the smoking bias . It is also important to point out that we are studying cases with a positive test for influenza . The Dutch version of European JEM was validated against questionnaire data , and the agreement was good with weighted κ ≥0 . 70 for number of contacts , nature of contacts , contami - nated workspaces and social distance . 25 It is also worth mentioning that we performed the JEM anal - yses based on assumptions of exposure to infected patients / persons and the risk of close proximity . The subsequent analyses of a high number of occupations may have given some spurious associations , although the pattern of risky occupations support the results of our exposure analysis . Instead , we may have missed some occupations at risk , due to small numbers , that is , occupa - tions with fewer than 50 infected persons . Our findings are broadly consistent with the report results from smaller studies conducted in other countries and contexts . Our results corroborate earlier studies of increased risk among HCWs , even if there are studies showing the opposite . 6 – 9 It is also noteworthy that HCWs such as psychologists , dentists and midwives are not among those with increased risk , which may simply reflect the low numbers of these HCWs . However , we conclude that close contact with other persons and / or work with infected patients / persons considerably increase the risk for influ - enza . Other groups that have close contacts with both the general public and infected persons are taxi drivers and bus drivers . In a Chinese study , using a taxi more than once a week was a clear risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS - CoV - 1 ) . 26 Infected persons may use public transportation ; a British study noted that during the influenza season of 2008 – 2009 , patients attending their primary care physician more often had used the bus or tram prior to their physician contact , as compared with controls . 27 This may represent a way for bus / tram drivers to be infected . It is of interest that we found minor increases in odds among teachers , both academic teachers and primary school teachers , which is in line with the findings from the COVID - 19 pandemic . The findings of our study are similar to the findings obtained in many recent studies investigating the occupational risks for COVID - 19 . 15 28 HCWs and occupations that involve close contact to other persons , such as taxi drivers and hairdressers , are at increased risk . Of note , we did not observe any substantial difference between the odds for influenza A and influenza B in any of the analysed dimensions . It should be stressed that in the present study , we did not cover the pandemic COVID - 19 period . That period merits a separate study to investigate the interplay between the influenza and SARS - CoV - 2 . Our results indicate that occupational groups with frequent contact with the public , as well as HCW are at increased risk for influenza . The HCW should be further strongly encouraged to complete vaccinations . In addition , it should be considered whether other groups with frequents public contact such as teachers , taxi drivers and bus drivers , also should be offered vaccinations . We conclude that close contact with infected or diseased patients / persons , and close physical proximity increased the odds of having a positive test for influenza virus . The results are similar for both influenza A and influenza B . The findings for different occupations support the idea that contacts with infected patients / persons and close proximity are important risk factors . There is a need to introduce additional safety measures , such as extended vaccination programmes , to reduce viral trans - mission in these environments .
