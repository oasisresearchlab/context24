NEBD involves the disassembly of all major structural elements of the nuclear envelope , including nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) , and the dispersal of nuclear membrane components . The breakdown process is facili - tated by microtubules of the mitotic spindle . After NEBD , engagement of spindle microtubules with chromosome - associated kinetochores leads to chromatid segregation . Several NPC subunits relocate to kinetochores after NEBD . N siRNA - mediated depletion of one of these proteins , Nup358 , reveals that it is essential for kinetochore function . In the absence of Nup358 , chromosome congression and segregation are severely perturbed . At the same time , the assembly of other kinetochore components is strongly inhibited , leading to aberrant kinetochore structure . The implication is that Nup358 plays an essential role in inte - grating NEBD with kinetochore maturation and function . Mitotic arrest associated with Nup358 depletion further suggests that mitotic checkpoint complexes may remain active at nonkinetochore sites . Introduction Segregation of chromatids during mitosis is accomplished by the mitotic spindle in a highly orchestrated process that requires the interaction of each chromosome with spindle microtubules . Chromosomal attachment of microtubules is mediated by kinetochores . These are elaborate structures that are assembled during mitotic prophase and that contain multiple protein species , including cell cycle regulatory molecules and microtubule motor proteins . Formation of each kinetochore takes place at the centromere , a chromosomal site enriched in a group of centromere - specific proteins ( CENPs ) , which includes CENP - A ( a histone H3 - like molecule ) as well as CENP - B and CENP - C ( Cleveland et al . , 2003 ) . Mature kinetochores appear as flat trilaminar plate - like structures that are able to capture the plus ends of spindle microtubules . In vertebrate cells , the mitotic spindle is an exclusively cytoplasmic structure . Consequently , for chromosomes enclosed within a nucleus to gain access to spindle microtubules , the nuclear envelope ( NE ) must be either partially or completely broken down . In all eukaryotes , the NE features a pair of inner and outer nuclear membranes that are joined in places where they are spanned by nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) ( Gerace and Burke , 1988 ; Gant and Wilson , 1997 ) . Metazoan NEs contain an additional structural element , the nuclear lamina , which is associated with the nuclear face of the inner nuclear membrane . The lamina consists of a thin ( 20 – 50 nm ) filamen - tous meshwork composed primarily of A - and B - type nuclear lamin proteins ( Gerace and Burke , 1988 ; Gant and Wilson , 1997 ) . During mitosis in mammalian somatic cells , the nuclear lamina and NPCs are disassembled . At the same time , nuclear membrane components disperse within the ER , which itself exhibits numerous connections with the outer nuclear membrane ( Ellenberg et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ; Ostlund et al . , 1999 ) . Disassembly of the lamina and NPCs occurs in response to phosphorylation of both lamina and NPC subunits ( Gerace and Blobel , 1980 ; Heald and McKeon , 1990 ; Macaulay et al . , 1995 ) . Although the majority of these components become distributed throughout the mitotic cytoplasm , certain NPC proteins ( nucleoporins or Nups ) and associated molecules , including Rae1 , Nup107 , and Nup133 , become preferentially associated with kinetochores ( Belgareh et al . , 2001 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ; Babu et al . , 2003 ) .

This relocation occurs in association with Ran GTPase activating protein 1 ( RanGAP1 ) , a molecule with which Nup358 also interacts during interphase . Conversely , certain mitotic checkpoint proteins , such as Mad1 and Mad2 , that are ki - netochore associated during mitosis are found at the nuclear face of NPCs during interphase ( Campbell et al . , 2001 ) . In yeast , this localization is mediated by Nup53p , part of a larger complex of NPC proteins that includes Nup157p and Nup170p ( Iouk et al . , 2002 ) . Remarkably , yeast strains defi - cient in Mad1p exhibit a reduced rate of nuclear protein im - port as well as decreased stability of the Nup53p complex ( Iouk et al . , 2002 ) . The implication is that there is a func - tional relationship between the mitotic apparatus and the NE . However , the significance of this has only recently be - come a focus of investigation . The interplay between the NE and the mitotic spindle is further highlighted by findings that the spindle itself plays an active role in nuclear membrane dispersal during pro - metaphase ( Beaudouin et al . , 2002 ; Salina et al . , 2002 ) . The entire process is driven by cytoplasmic dynein , a microtu - bule minus end – directed motor protein , which concentrates on the NE during late G2 / early prophase ( Salina et al . , 2002 ) . By engaging with spindle microtubules , NE - linked dynein causes the deformation and rupture of the nuclear membranes , leading to release of the condensed chromo - somes into the cytoplasm . This process , in effect , represents a mechanical checkpoint because it provides a means to de - lay NE breakdown ( NEBD ) until functional spindle micro - tubules have been assembled . Although the identity of the dynein - binding partner on the NE remains unknown , cytoplasmically exposed NPC subunits have been suggested as possible candidates . One such protein , Nup358 , is of particular interest because it is known to associate with both the mitotic spindle and kinet - ochores . To determine whether Nup358 does indeed play a role in early mitotic progression , we employed an siRNA ap - proach to deplete cells of this particular nucleoporin . Al - though we were unable to find any evidence for an involve - ment in dynein binding and NEBD ( unpublished data ) , we did observe a surprising effect on chromosome congression . Our data suggest that Nup358 plays an essential role in ki - netochore function and chromatid segregation . Results Examination of HeLa cell cultures exposed to Nup358 siRNA reveals a series of striking changes that occur over a period of several days . During the first 24 – 48 h of siRNA treatment , an accumulation of prometaphase cells becomes apparent ( Fig . 1 B ) . By 120 h , this reaches a peak of almost 50 % of the total mitotic population , a threefold increase in the frequency of prometaphase cells over that observed in mock - treated cultures ( Fig . 1 B ) . A second population of cells , characterized by the presence of multiple micronuclei ( Fig . 1 A ) , emerges between 24 and 96 h . This very unusual morphology is rarely encountered in control cultures and is a characteristic feature of Nup358 siRNA treatment . It is not observed after depletion of other nucleoporins such as Nup153 ( unpublished data ) or when ineffective RNA oligo - nucleotides are used . As there is a progressive increase in apoptosis leading to a decline in the number of cells contain - ing micronuclei after (cid:2) 120 h of Nup358 siRNA treatment ( Fig . 1 C ) , the majority of our subsequent experiments were performed on cells exposed to Nup358 siRNA for a maxi - mum of 96 h . Immunoblot analysis of HeLa cultures subjected to Nup358 siRNA treatment for a period of 4 d reveals a de - cline in the level of Nup358 of (cid:2) 50 % when compared with mock - treated cells ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . As an independent Figure 1 . Mitotic defects associated with Nup358 siRNA treatment of HeLa cells . Nup358 siRNA treatment of HeLa cells leads to the appearance of cells containing multiple micronuclei over a period of 24 – 96 h ( A ) as well as the accumulation of cells arrested in prometaphase ( B ) . The latter reach a peak at 120 h , at which time they account for almost 50 % of the total mitotic population ( B ) . A gradual increase in apoptosis , peaking at 120 h , is also observed ( C ) . This increase in apoptosis may account for the decline in the number of multinucleate cells observed after 96 h of Nup358 siRNA treatment .

In both si - RNA - treated and control cultures , measurements were per - formed on all cells in multiple randomly selected fields . These measurements revealed an average decline in Nup358 - asso - ciated fluorescence of (cid:2) 60 % , a value that is consistent with the immunoblot data ( Fig . 2 C ) . At the single cell level , fluorescence intensity reductions of 80 % or more could be observed . Cells containing multiple micronuclei exhibited an average reduction in anti - Nup358 fluores - cence intensity of (cid:2) 77 % when compared with mock - treated cells ( Fig . 2 C ) . Loss of Nup358 had little , if any , effect on NPC number , as estimated in immunofluorescence experiments using a va - riety of antinucleoporin antibodies . Nup153 ( Fig . 2 C and Fig . 3 A ) and other FG - repeat nucleoporins , including the NPC membrane protein POM121 , remained NE associated and retained their usual punctate distribution ( unpublished data ) . Puncta per unit NE surface remained essentially un - changed after siRNA treatment ( unpublished data ) . Distri - bution of another nucleoporin , Nup214 , which resides on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC , appears largely unaffected in cells , including multinucleate cells , depleted of Nup358 ( Fig . 2 ) . Similar results were obtained for Nup98 , a mobile nucleoporin that , like Nup153 , is localized to the nuclear face of the NPC ( unpublished data ) . EM analysis of multi - nucleate cells from siRNA - treated cultures ( such cells are al - ways depleted of Nup358 ; Fig . 2 C and Fig . 3 D ) revealed numerous NPCs ( Fig . 3 B ) . However , the presence or ab - sence of NPC - associated cytoplasmic filaments could not be reliably ascertained in this type of thin section analysis . Taken together , these data indicate that NPCs remain sub - stantially intact after Nup358 depletion in vivo . Nup358 - depleted nuclei , including micronuclei , retained the capacity to import both A - type lamins ( Fig . 3 D ) and an inducible ( by dexamethasone ) nuclear transport substrate , a glucocorticoid receptor – (cid:2) - galactosidase fusion protein ( GR (cid:2) ; Fig . 4 , A and B ) . In the case of the latter , import was followed over time in both mock - treated cells and in cells depleted of Nup358 . For this experiment , cells were double labeled with antibodies against both Nup358 and (cid:2) - galac - tosidase . In this way , cells specifically depleted of Nup358 could be scored for nuclear accumulation of GR (cid:2) . As shown in Fig . 4 B , Nup358 depletion had little or no effect on the nuclear uptake of GR (cid:2) . In addition , there were no obvious changes in the gross distribution of the import receptor im - portin / karyopherin - (cid:2) ( Fig . 4 C ) in mock - treated versus Nup358 - depleted multinucleate cells . These observations are consistent with recent findings that nuclei assembled in vitro in the absence of Nup358 contain functional NPCs and are import competent ( Walther et al . , 2002 ) . The accumulation of “prometaphase” cells after 96 h of siRNA treatment is associated with abnormal or ineffective congression of chromosomes at the metaphase plate . Al - though centrosome separation appears to occur on schedule , some perturbation of spindle morphology is evident . Often , spindles associated with Nup358 siRNA treatment appeared elongated or somewhat irregular . On average , pole - to - pole distance was increased by (cid:2) 16 % in Nup358 siRNA – treated versus control cells . The chromosome congression defect , observed in the majority of prometaphase cells at the 96 - h time point , is manifest as a trimodal distribution of chromo - somes with irregular , largely nonaligned clusters at the spin - dle equator as well as smaller clusters over either pole ( Fig . 4 A ) . These cells showed a mean reduction in anti - Nup358 – associated fluorescence intensity of (cid:2) 60 % ( Fig . 4 B ) . This very unusual chromosome distribution is rarely observed in untreated cultures or in cultures depleted of another nucle - oporin , Nup153 ( unpublished data ) . However , such a phe - notype is observed after depletion of several spindle - , ki - netochore - , and centromere - associated proteins , including Drosophila MAST / Orbit , CENP - A , CENP - E , and hMis12 ( Yao et al . , 2000 ; McEwen et al . , 2001 ; Maiato et al . , 2002 ; Putkey et al . , 2002 ; Goshima et al . , 2003 ) . Figure 2 . Cells containing multiple micronuclei are depleted of Nup358 . A single high molecular weight band is recognized on a Western blot of a HeLa whole cell extract by the anti - Nup358 antibodies that are employed in this study ( A ) . Total protein content of the cell extract is shown in the Coomassie blue – stained lane ( gel ) . Molecular weight markers ( MW , kD ) are indicated on the left . A 50 % reduction in total Nup358 levels in Nup358 siRNA – treated ( RNAi ) versus control cultures ( Mock ) is shown by quantitative Western blot analysis ( B ) . For this experiment , twofold dilution series of HeLa cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against Nup358 ( A ) as well as (cid:2) - tubulin as an internal standard . Two sample pairs ( differing in concentration by a factor of two ) from both control and siRNA - treated cultures are shown . Changes in Nup358 levels were determined from the ratios of the Nup358 / (cid:2) - tubulin band intensities . These experiments were performed in quadruplicate over a 16 - fold sample concentration range . Immunofluorescence microscopy of Nup358 siRNA – treated cultures reveals a loss of NE - associated Nup358 ( C ) . This is particularly evident in cells containing multiple micronuclei . A second nucleoporin , Nup153 , shows no such decline . Fluorescence intensity measurements performed on randomly selected interphase cells ( Total ) indicate a 66 % reduction in Nup358 levels ( (cid:3) 5 % ; P (cid:4) 0 . 001 ) in siRNA - treated versus control ( Mock ) cells . A larger average reduction in anti - Nup358 fluorescence intensity of 77 % ( (cid:3) 1 % ; P (cid:4) 0 . 001 ) is observed when measurements are restricted to cells containing multiple micronuclei ( MN ) .

In these cells , an NE reforms around individual chromosomes and groups of chro - mosomes , giving rise to the multiple micronuclei described above . These cells invariably show reduced labeling with anti - Nup358 antibodies ( Fig . 2 C and Fig . 3 D ) . Surprisingly , many of these cells form an intracellular bridge and undergo cytokinesis ( Fig . 5 C ) . Indeed at the 96 - h time point , (cid:2) 34 % of “telophase” or early G1 cells ( defined by the presence of an intracellular bridge ) were found to contain multiple micro - nuclei . Few such cells were observed in corresponding mock - treated populations . The ultimate fate of these unusual cells seems to be death , because , as pointed out above , the fre - quency of apoptosis increases steadily up to 5 d after siRNA treatment . After this time point , the occurrence of cells con - taining multiple micronuclei generally declines ( Fig . 1 B ) . Remarkably , a virtually identical effect , including micronu - clear formation and aberrant cytokinesis , has recently been reported in cells depleted of CENP - A and hMis12 , a human kinetochore protein ( Goshima et al . , 2003 ) . Further analyses of arrested cells after 96 h of siRNA treat - ment suggest that congression failure is due , at least partially , to defects at the kinetochore . A role for Nup358 in kineto - chore function is suggested by work from Joseph et al . ( 2002 ) , who have shown that a population of Nup358 is lo - calized at kinetochores during mitosis . We have been able to confirm this observation , as well as show that Nup358 is as - sociated , at least in part , with the outer portion of the kinet - ochore ( Fig . 6 ) . This localization was concluded from double label experiments using anti - Nup358 in combination with either an anticentromere human autoimmune serum ( ACA ; Fig . 6 A ) or an antibody against CENP - F , a protein of the kinetochore fibrous corona ( Fig . 6 B ) . Anti - Nup358 kineto - chore labeling is clearly reduced in siRNA - treated cells ( Fig . 6 C ) . We therefore examined the distribution , in arrested cells , of a number of components that normally associate transiently with mitotic kinetochores . These include dynein , CENP - E , CENP - F , the mitotic checkpoint proteins Mad1 and Mad2 , and Zw10 . None of these proteins show their normal mitotic distribution . Instead , they exhibit aberrant kinetochore targeting and many are partially or completely mislocalized to the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . Fluorescence intensity measurements indicate a reduction in kinetochore - associated CENP - E , CENP - F , Mad - 1 , and dynein of (cid:2) 60 % using ACA labeling as an internal reference ( Fig . 7 B ) . When these transient proteins do associate with the kinetochore in the Nup358 - depleted prometaphase cells , they are almost in - Figure 3 . Cells depleted of Nup358 contain identifiable NPCs . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy reveals little or no change in the levels or localizations of multiple nucleoporins , including Nup153 and Nup214 , in multinucleate cells depleted of Nup358 ( A and B ) . EM reveals the presence of abundant NPCs associated with micronuclei in cells subjected to Nup358 siRNA treatment ( C ) . Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that such cells are always depleted of Nup358 ( D ) . Cells depleted of Nup358 , including multinucleate cells , continue to incorporate A - type lamins ( D ) into the nuclear lamina over a period of 96 h .

Cell cycle invariant kinetochore components , includ - ing those that are recognized by the ACA serum , do show an appropriate localization ( Fig . 7 A ) and are found on both po - lar and equatorial clusters . The implication of these observa - tions is that Nup358 is required for the normal assembly of proteins at the kinetochore and hence for kinetochore func - tion . This view is reinforced and expanded by ultrastructural analysis of kinetochores in prometaphase cells that accumu - late during 4 d of siRNA treatment . In contrast to the normal plate - like trilaminar kinetochore structure that is observed in control or mock - treated cultures ( Fig . 7 C , a ) , siRNA - treated cells exhibit a variety of very un - usual kinetochore morphologies ( Fig . 7 C , b – d ) . In particu - lar , the kinetochores in these cells may form a plate that is everted into a “C” shape ( in thin section ) and that fails to at - tain a compact trilaminar structure ( Fig . 7 C , d ) . Alterna - tively the plate may be absent entirely so that the kineto - chore appears as a diffuse mass of material similar to that described for prekinetochores in untreated cells ( Fig . 7 C , b and c ) . Both of these kinetochore morphologies are often as - sociated with centromeric hetrochromatin that shows anom - alous condensation . It seems likely that these two morpholo - gies result from the partial or complete disruption of normal kinetochore formation . Thus far , we have been unable to make any correlation between the appearance of these aber - rant kinetochore morphologies and chromosome location within the cell . Few microtubules impinge upon the aberrant kinetochores , indicating that they are defective with respect to microtubule capture ( Fig . 7 C , b – d ) . This loss of kineto - chore organization can account for the trimodal distribution of chromosomes that is characteristic of Nup358 siRNA – treated prometaphase cells . The majority of chromosomes , containing defective kinetochores , remains clustered and nonaligned ( Fig . 6 C ) at the cell center flanked by a pair of Figure 4 . Nuclei in cells depleted of Nup358 are import competent . Nuclear import of GR (cid:2) is unaffected in Nup358 siRNA – treated ( RNAi ) versus mock - treated cells . In the absence of dexamethasone ( (cid:6) Dex ) , GR (cid:2) remains almost exclusively cytoplasmic ( A ) . After exposure to dexa - methasone for 10 min ( (cid:7) Dex ) , GR (cid:2) relocates to the nucleus ( or micronuclei ) . To establish a time course of GR (cid:2) import ( B ) , cells were scored for nuclear accumulation of GR (cid:2) . This was defined as average nuclear fluo - rescence intensity greater than average cytoplasmic intensity . The graph ( B ) repre - sents the mean of four experiments in which 200 cells were scored at each time point . For the RNAi samples , only cells clearly depleted of Nup358 were included in the counts . The overall distribution of the nuclear import receptor importin - (cid:2) is also largely unaffected by depletion of Nup358 ( C ) .

Only the few chromosomes that do assemble kinetochores , and are capable of capturing microtubules , are able to migrate to either pole . These gross aberrations in ki - netochore morphology and function clearly indicate that Nup358 plays an essential role in early mitotic progression . A final issue that arises is whether Nup358 itself might have a role as a spindle assembly checkpoint protein . To ad - dress this , we examined the effects of simultaneous depletion of Nup358 and the bona fide checkpoint protein Mad1 ( Fig . 8 ) . Depletion of Mad1 has previously been shown to result in premature anaphase and the appearance of lagging chromo - somes ( Luo et al . , 2002 ; Martin - Lluesma et al . , 2002 ) . The prediction is that if the spindle assembly checkpoint remains functional in Nup358 - depleted cells , then loss of Mad1 should result in a decline in the number of prometaphase / metaphase cells . At the same time , given the Nup358 - associ - ated congression defect , there should be an increase in the number of cells containing multiple micronuclei . As shown in Fig . 8 , this is precisely what occurs . In cultures depleted only of Nup358 , there is a 70 % increase in the number metaphase and premetaphase cells over mock - treated cul - tures . It must be emphasized that this figure represents a minimum value , given the heterogeneity of the Nup358 siRNA – treated cells . If we had only counted cells overtly de - pleted of Nup358 , this increase would be on the order of 150 – 300 % . Simultaneous depletion of both Nup358 and Mad1 yielded a sevenfold decline in the number of meta - phase and premetaphase cells ( compared with Nup358 de - pletion alone ) . Taken together , these results indicate that Nup358 is unlikely to possess a checkpoint function . Discussion Nup358 , also known as Ran binding protein 2 ( RanBP2 ) , is a very large protein that is a core component of the 100 - nm filaments that extend from the cytoplasmic face of NPCs ( Yokoyama et al . , 1995 ; Walther et al . , 2002 ) . The Nup358 molecule contains numerous FG repeats that have been shown to form binding sites for transport receptors of the importin / karyopherin - (cid:2) family ( Delphin et al . , 1997 ) . Early studies on the mechanisms of signal - mediated nuclear pro - tein import revealed that import substrates bearing NLSs ini - tially docked at the cytoplasmic filaments before translo - cation across the NPC ( Richardson et al . , 1988 ; Panté and Aebi , 1996 ) . Taken together , these results imply that Nup358 represents an early docking site for NLS - bearing proteins associated with their cognate receptors . Nup358 also binds RanGAP1 , the activating protein for Ran , a small Ras - related GTPase that is an important regulator of nucleo - cytoplasmic transport ( Saitoh et al . , 1997 ) . Only RanGAP1 molecules that have been modified with the small ubiquitin - like protein SUMO associate with Nup358 at the nuclear periphery ( Mahajan et al . , 1997 ; Matunis et al . , 1998 ) . In - triguingly , Nup358 itself has SUMO E3 ligase activity ( Pichler et al . , 2002 ) . In this way , Nup358 might act not just as a docking protein but also as a regulator , albeit indirect , of the cytoplasmic levels of Ran - GDP versus Ran - GTP . It therefore comes as some surprise that Nup358 is apparently dispensable with respect to nucleocytoplasmic transport . Nuclei assembled in vitro in Xenopus egg extracts depleted of Nup358 are transport competent , although the NPCs within these nuclei lack cytoplasmic filaments ( Walther et al . , 2002 ) . Whether the kinetics of import in vitro are af - fected by elimination of Nup358 is not clear . However , these results are consistent with our own findings that deple - tion , albeit incomplete , of Nup358 in HeLa cells has no pro - found affect on the uptake of proteins into the nucleus . Although we observed little effect on nuclear protein im - port in Nup358 siRNA – treated HeLa cells , the effects on mitotic progression were quite dramatic . We noted the emergence of two unusual cell populations : prometaphase cells in which there was a failure in chromosome congression and interphase cells containing multiple micronuclei . The most reasonable explanation for the appearance of these cell populations is a failure of spindle microtubules to capture chromosomes followed eventually by mitotic exit and NE reformation around dispersed chromosomes or groups of chromosomes . In this way , the defective prometaphase cells would represent the precursors of the multinucleate cells . Figure 5 .

In many anaphase and telophase cells in 4 - d siRNA - treated cultures , the pres - ence of lagging chromosomes and chromatin strands span - ning the intracellular bridge is yet further indication of con - gression failure and eventual mitotic exit . The findings that Nup358 is associated with both spindle microtubules and kinetochores in mitotic cells are consistent with a number of recent studies that have revealed a direct role for components of the Ran system in mitotic spindle as - sembly . Members of the importin / karyopherin family are also implicated in these processes . A role for Nup358 in chro - matid segregation has been highlighted in a recent study on Caenorhabditis elegans early embryos ( Askjaer et al . , 2002 ) . An RNA interference approach has revealed that depletion of Nup358 / RanBP2 leads to inhibition of chromosome con - gression associated with aberrant spindle morphology , very similar to the situation described here in HeLa cells . Al - though asters do form , chromosome capture does not occur and bipolar spindles are not seen . Identical effects have also been observed in C . elegans embryos that have been depleted of CENP - A , a protein required for normal kinetochore for - mation ( Oegema et al . , 2001 ) . These observations confirm a role for kinetochores in spindle organization and indicate that Nup358 depletion could be interfering with either ki - netochore or spindle microtubule function , or indeed both . Clearly , defects in either of these structures could in principle give rise to the types of aberrations in chromatid segregation that both we and Askjaer et al . ( 2002 ) have observed . Taken together , our data suggest that the primary effects of Nup358 depletion on spindle assembly and function are operating at the level of kinetochore formation and matura - tion . EM studies of Nup358 - depleted prometaphase cells re - veal aberrant kinetochore morphology that features partial or complete loss of the trilaminar plate structure as well as incomplete condensation of subjacent centromeric hetero - chromatin . The C - shaped kinetochore morphology has also been reported after premature chromatin condensation in cell fusion experiments ( Rattner and Wang , 1992 ) , as well as after exposure to caffeine ( Brinkley et al . , 1988 ) , whereas the expanded morphology is characteristic of prekinetochores ( He and Brinkley , 1996 ) . Of particular significance is our finding that certain kinetochore components , including the checkpoint proteins Mad1 , Mad2 , and Zw10 , are mislocal - ized in prometaphase cells depleted of Nup358 . Studies by Chan et al . ( 2000 ) using an antibody microinjection strategy have demonstrated quite convincingly that interference with Figure 6 .

Cells were also labeled with Hoechst dye ( shown in blue in A and B ) to reveal the mitotic chromo - somes . Untreated HeLa cells are shown in A and B . The insets reveal that Nup358 lies distal to the centromere and instead largely colocalizes with CENP - F , an outer kinetochore protein . Nup358 siRNA – treated cells are shown in C and reveal a loss of both kinetochore and spindle - associated Nup358 , although ACA labeling is unaffected . Chromosome congression is clearly abnormal in these cells . In A and B , merged images are shown both with ( right ) and without ( left ) superimposition of the chromosomes . In C , the merged images show only the antibody labeling . In each set , Nup358 labeling is shown in red . on A ugu s t 29 , 2008 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published September 8 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 998 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 162 , Number 6 , 2003 one of these , Zw10 , leads to bypass of the spindle assembly checkpoint , appearance of lagging chromatids , and aneu - ploidy ( Chan et al . , 2000 ) . More recently , Yao et al . ( 2000 ) have shown that depletion of CENP - E in mammalian cells gives rise to a spectrum of anomalies that is virtually identi - cal to what we have reported in this paper . This is consistent with our own finding that CENP - E is mislocalized in Nup358 - depleted cells . Very similar defects have also been reported in studies involving depletion of several other ki - netochore proteins , including Hec1 , hMis12 , and Drosoph - ila Mast / Orbit ( Maiato et al . , 2002 ; Martin - Lluesma et al . , 2002 ; Goshima et al . , 2003 ) . The finding that depletion of Nup358 perturbs kineto - chore structure and interferes with microtubule binding suggests that Nup358 has an important function in the as - sembly of the kinetochore . Such a role for Nup358 might be related to its ability to attract and bind other proteins of the Ran system . Indeed , RanGap1 and SUMO - I have both been found at the kinetochore ( Joseph et al . , 2002 ) . Given that SUMO - modified RanGAP1 binds Nup358 at the NPC , it is tempting to imagine that Nup358 performs a similar function at the kinetochore during mitosis . In fact , a population of Ran is found at the kinetochore during mitosis while its nucleotide exchange factor , RCC1 , re - mains chromatin associated ( Moore et al . , 2002 ) . In C . ele - gans , depletion of RCC1 by RNA interference produces ef - fects similar , although less severe , to those observed after Nup358 depletion ( Askjaer et al . , 2002 ) . As Ran has been shown to be essential for kinetochore – microtubule interac - tion , these various Ran system components could well function to modulate the cycling of proteins on and off the kinetochore . Interference with one branch of the Ran sys - tem might then result in the structural and compositional defects detected in our study . Such a view is lent consider - able support by the recent findings of Arnaoutov and Dasso ( 2003 ) on the critical role of the Ran GTPase in Figure 7 . Nup358 siRNAi treatment causes changes in both kinetochore composition and morphology in prometaphase cells . Double indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of mitotic HeLa cells reveals that multiple proteins are lost from kinetochores in Nup358 siRNA – versus mock - treated cells ( A ) . These include CENP - E , CENP - F , dynein , and Mad1 ( A ) as well as Mad2 and Zw10 ( B ; siRNA - treated cell populations are represented by light gray bars , whereas dark gray indicates control populations ) . Occasional kinetochore labeling is observed with antibodies against these various components ( A ) . This is invariably associated with polar chromosome clusters and not with the larger equatorial clusters . This is particularly evident in the CENP - E and CENP - F panels ( A ) . Electron micrographs ( C ) of the kinetochores of control ( a ) versus siRNA - treated cells ( b – d ) . The square brackets indicate a normal kinetochore with associated microtubules in panel a and expanded , diffuse kinetochores in b and c . C - shaped everted kinetochores are also a feature of Nup358 siRNA treatment ( d , arrowheads ) .

A second possibility is that since Nup358 is a SUMO ligase ( Pichler et al . , 2002 ) , this activ - ity might be required for proper kinetochore organization and function . In this regard , it is intriguing that SUMO - 1 can act as a suppressor of certain CENP - C mutations in vertebrate cells ( Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ) . Our findings clearly indicate that Nup358 has an impor - tant role in the recruitment of kinetochore proteins , includ - ing those involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint . However , Nup358 itself appears unlikely to be a checkpoint protein per se . Rather , our data suggest that the spindle as - sembly checkpoint remains substantially intact in cells de - pleted of Nup358 , and that such cells display only a rela - tively slow escape from the mitotic arrest . This escape could , however , be accelerated by codepletion of Mad1 . Con - versely , nocodazole treatment of both mock - and Nup358 - depleted cells yielded little difference in the numbers of cells arrested in prometaphase ( unpublished data ) . Given the sub - stantial , albeit incomplete , mislocalization of kinetochore - associated proteins in cells depleted of Nup358 , these results involving Mad1 codepletion are consistent with the notion that checkpoint complexes may remain functional at other cytoplasmic sites . Could Nup358 depletion be having an indirect effect on kinetochore function ? We know that Nup358 is part of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery . It is formally possi - ble , therefore , that the mitotic defects we have observed could be a consequence of failure to import crucial kineto - chore components into the nucleus in late G2 . This sce - nario , however , seems very unlikely . All the evidence that we and others have available suggests that nuclear protein import is not seriously perturbed by Nup358 depletion ( Walther et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , if it were , we would expect cells to arrest in interphase and not to enter mitosis . Given its localization during mitosis , the most reasonable model re - mains that Nup358 is actually functional at the kinetochore . Why should NPC or NE components play any role at all during mitosis ? Joseph et al . ( 2002 ) have made the interest - ing proposal that the reciprocal relationship between the NPC and the mitotic spindle , represented by the cycling of proteins between these two structures , provides a fail - safe signal that defines the interphase versus mitotic status of the cell . Our data on Nup358 would suggest that this idea can also be extended to the kinetochore , which can only become functional once NEBD , disassembly of NPCs , and transfer of some NPC components to the kinetochores has com - menced . In this way , an orderly and stepwise progression of mitotic events is ensured . This relationship between the NPC ( or at least the NE ) and the kinetochore may have its roots in the evolutionary history of these two structures . Many primitive cell types that undergo a closed mitosis , di - noflagellates for example , have well - differentiated kineto - chores that remain closely associated with the nuclear surface of the NE ( Kubai , 1975 ; Ris , 1975 ) . In Trichonympha agilis , spindle microtubules , which are exclusively cytoplasmic , make contact not with the kinetochore itself , but with the patch of nuclear membrane that overlies the kinetochore ( Kubai , 1975 ) . In this way , chromosome segregation , although driven by the mitotic spindle , is actually mediated by NE com - ponents . It is possible that this mechanism has been conserved in organisms that have evolved an open mitosis such that disas - sembled NE components still maintain their ancient role . Materials and methods Cell culture HeLa cells were maintained at 7 . 5 % CO 2 and 37 (cid:8) C in DME ( GIBCO BRL ) plus 10 % FBS ( Hyclone ) , 10 % penicillin / streptomycin ( GIBCO BRL ) , and 2 mM glutamine . Antibodies The following antibodies were used in this study . Antibodies against LAP 2 (cid:2) and Nup358 were obtained from L . Gerace ( Scripps Research Institute , Figure 8 . Depletion of Mad1 reverses the Nup358 siRNA – induced prometaphase arrest . Double indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cell cultures treated with Nup358 and / or Mad1 siRNAs and labeled with antibodies against both Nup358 and Mad1 ( A ) . In interphase cells , Mad1 , like Nup358 , localizes almost exclusively to the nuclear periphery . Depletion of either protein in interphase cells has little or no effect on the distribution of the other . During mitosis , Nup358 depletion results in a significant ( 70 % ) increase in the number of premetaphase and metaphase cells over mock - treated cultures ( B ) . This effect is reversed by codepletion of Mad1 . Conversely , depletion of both proteins causes an increase in the number of multinucleate cells . 2 – 4 , 000 cells were scored in each category in four independent experiments . It should be noted that these counts represent percentages derived from total cell populations . To eliminate bias , no attempt was made to discriminate between transfected versus nontransfected cells .

An additional antibody against Nup358 was also obtained from T . Nishimoto ( Kyushu University , Fukuoka - shi , Japan ) . Anti – CENP - E , - Zw10 , and - Mad1 / 2 antibodies were obtained from G . Chan ( University of Alberta , Alberta , Canada ) . Antibodies against Mad1 were also provided by T . Yen ( Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia , PA ) . The antibody against importin (cid:2) was obtained from D . Gorlich ( ZMBH , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Antibodies against various nucleoporins ( QE5 ) , including Nup153 ( SA1 ) and Nup214 , have been described elsewhere ( Panté et al . , 1994 ; Bodoor et al . , 1999 ) . The antibody against CENP - F as well as the hu - man autoimmune anticentromere antibody ( ACA ) have also been de - scribed previously ( Kingwell and Rattner , 1987 ; Liao et al . , 1995 ) . The anti – (cid:2) - tubulin antibody was obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . The monoclo - nal antibody 74 . 1 against dynein intermediate chain was obtained from BabCo . Anti – (cid:2) - galactocidase antibody was obtained from Promega . Sec - ondary antibodies were from Biosource International . Immunofluorescence microscopy HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in either 100 % meth - anol at (cid:6) 20 (cid:8) C or 3 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by a 5 - min permeabilization with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . The cells were then labeled with the appropriate antibodies plus the DNA - specific Hoechst dye 33258 . For the experiment in Fig . 6 , the cells were preextracted with 0 . 005 % digitonin and later fixed in (cid:6) 20 (cid:8) C methanol exactly as previously described ( Joseph et al . , 2002 ) . Specimens were observed using a Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . Axiophot microscope . Images were collected us - ing a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ CCD camera linked to an Apple Macin - tosh G4 computer running IP Lab Spectrum software ( Spectrum Analytics , Inc . ) . Fluorescence intensity measurements were performed using IP Lab ( Salina et al . , 2002 ) . EM Cells grown and treated in 35 - mm Petri dishes were fixed in 3 % glutaral - dehyde and 0 . 2 % tannic acid in 200 mM sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature . Postfixation was in 2 % OsO 4 for 20 min . The cells were dehydrated in ethanol , lifted from the culture dish using propylene oxide , and then infiltrated with Polybed 812 resin . Polymerization was performed at 60 (cid:8) C for 24 h . Silver - gray sections were cut using a Leica ul - tramicrotome equipped with a diamond knife . The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a JEOL JEM - 100CXII electron microscope . In vivo nuclear import assay To examine the effects of Nup358 depletion on nuclear protein import , HeLa cells , grown on glass coverslips , were exposed to Nup358 siRNA for 3 d . At this time , the cells were transfected with an expression plasmid en - coding GR (cid:2) ( Picard and Yamamoto , 1987 ) . Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s recom - mendations . 24 h after transfection , dexamethasone was added to the me - dium to a final concentration of 10 (cid:5) g / ml . The cells were returned to the incubator for a period of up to 30 min and then fixed with 3 % formalde - hyde in PBS . Finally , The cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against both (cid:2) - galactosidase and Nup358 . siRNA methods HeLa cells were depleted of Nup358 using siRNA corresponding to nucle - otides 7632 – 7654 of human Nup358 ( Dharmacon ) . The cells were ex - posed to the Nup358 siRNA in the presence of Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) precisely as described by Harborth et al . ( 2001 ) . As a control , cells were exposed either to Oligofectamine alone , to Nup153 siRNA , or to an inef - fective RNA duplex . For Mad1 depletion , the procedures and oligonucle - otide sequences described by Martin - Lluesma et al . ( 2002 ) were followed precisely . In codepletion experiments , cells were first exposed to Nup358 siRNA . After 48 h , a combination of both Mad1 and Nup358 siRNAs was introduced to the cells . After an additional 48 h incubation , the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy . Immunoblotting and gel electrophoresis Cells ( siRNA or mock treated ) grown in 35 - mm tissue culture dishes were washed once in PBS and then lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 : 1 , 000 CLAP ( 10 mg / ml in DMSO of each of the following : chymostatin , leupeptin , antipain , and pepstatin ) . The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 (cid:8) C . Proteins in the supernatant were precipi - tated by the addition of TCA to a final concentration of 10 % . The precipi - tate was washed with ethanol / ether and then solubilized in sodium do - decyl sulfate – PAGE sample buffer . Protein samples were fractionated on 8 % polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters , usually BA85 from Schleicher & Schuell ( Burnette , 1981 ) , using a semi - dry blotting apparatus manufactured by Hoeffer Scientific Instruments , Inc . Fil - ters were blocked , labeled with primary antibodies , and then developed with peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies exactly as previously described ( Burke et al . , 1982 ) .
