It has impacts on patients as well as on health care resources . To address medical overuse , it is important to understand the knowledge and experiences of overuse on the side of patients . Research questions What is the citizens’ understanding of overuse ? How do they assess its relevance , causes , consequences and potential solutions ? Methods A quantitative online survey was conducted . The participants were asked to state what they understand by medical overuse . Statements on causes , consequences and possible solu - tions were evaluated . Recruitment was carried out via a panel of a market research institute ( Schlesinger Group ) . Results The survey was completed by 406 participants . In terms of age and gender , the sample cor - responded to the distribution in the German population . The majority had never heard of medical overuse ( 58 % ) . About 60 % assumed that medical overuse means " too much medi - cine including overtreatment and overtesting” . Medical overuse was mainly suspected for services not covered by the public health insurance system ( 56 % ) , surgical interventions ( 45 % ) and medication prescriptions ( 37 % ) . Reasons for medical overuse were seen in uncoordinated care and financial incentives , but also in the expectations of patients . The main problem with medical overuse was seen in rising health care costs , while harmful phys - ical and mental consequences for patients were mentioned less often . In order to reduce medical overuse , little importance was attributed to a primary care based system or higher financial contribution of patients . Instead , stricter cost control on the side of physicians and PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0299907 March 7 , 2024 1 / 17 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Nu¨rnberger C , Ku¨hleinT , Hueber S ( 2024 ) What do peopleknow and think about medical overuse ? an onlinequestionnairestudy in Germany .

Differences in socio - demographic characteristics hardly showed any differences in response behavior . Conclusion More than half of the respondents had never heard of medical overuse . Overuse was mainly associated with financial causes and consequences . It was not seen that overuse can be harmful for patients directly . The limited awareness of the problem of overuse probably is a barrier to tackling it effectively . Communicating the topic to the public might therefore be an effective start to mitigate medical overuse . Take home message Many citizens seem not to be familiar with the concept of medical overuse , especially not with the fact that it may directly cause harm to patients . Informing citizens about the harms of medical overuse might be helpful in mitigating it . Introduction Background Medical overuse is defined as health care services that exceed the individual needs of patients and when the potential harms of medical interventions exceed their benefits [ 1 ] . Despite this seemingly clear definition , measuring overuse bears some difficulties . Some treatments that can cause too much harm to a majority of patients , might be a reasonable option for others or vice versa [ 2 , 3 ] . Reasons for medical overuse can be patient or provider driven . There is a widespread belief among the public , that more care would be better [ 4 ] . Country specific health care regulations might mitigate or contribute to overuse . Patients exposed to overuse can experience several types of harm , including physical , psychological , social or financial con - sequences [ 5 , 6 ] . Overuse accounts for between 10 and 30 percent of all treatments [ 4 ] , which has a strong impact on overall healthcare resources , both financial and human [ 6 ] . To mitigate the consequences of unnecessary medical interventions , the concept of quater - nary prevention has been developed [ 7 ] . Different guidelines have been established to help physicians decide about appropriate care . A prominent example in Germany is the guideline of the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians ( DEGAM ) “Protection against overuse and underuse of health care – choosing together” , which provides guidance for treatment in primary care [ 8 ] . Some guidelines also exist in easy language for patients . There is a number of campaigns that address overuse and comprise related guidelines , such as " Choos - ing Wisely " by the American Board of Internal Medicine [ 9 ] , " Too much medicine " by the Brit - ish Medical Journal [ 10 ] , and the initiative " Klug entscheiden " by the German Society of Internal Medicine [ 11 ] . As suggested by Morgan et al . ( 2015 ) research on medical overuse should follow a struc - tured agenda . A crucial step is to explore how medical overuse is perceived in society and to understand where patients and the public see reasons for it and potential for improvement [ 4 ] . Surveys among citizens have already been conducted in Australia [ 12 ] and the United King - dom [ 13 ] . However , those studies mainly focused on patients’ perceptions of overdiagnosis but not overtreatment and overuse . The term overdiagnosis describes a diagnosis that never would have caused symptoms or harms during a patients’ lifetime . Overdiagnosis triggers PLOS ONE What do peopleknow and think about medicaloveruse ? PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0299907 March 7 , 2024 2 / 17 overuse in the context of unnecessary further diagnostic and therapeutic measures [ 14 , 15 ] . Both studies revealed that patients have a different understanding of overdiagnosis as com - pared to the scientific community as well as a low level of understanding about the underlying problem [ 12 , 13 ] . A study among German primary care physicians showed that some do recog - nize overuse as a problem while those who tend to overuse see themselves being criticized by the term itself and react defensively [ 16 ] . Physicians also see little opportunity for counterac - tion on their own . Instead , they attribute reasons to factors within the healthcare system and to patients’ expectations [ 17 , 18 ] . Patients seem not to be aware of medical overuse and hence do not realize the problematic nature of the issue . They stated that they did not personally experience overuse yet and seem more likely to fear medical underuse than overuse . Many per - ceived overuse as particularly good care [ 16 , 19 ] . So far , the perception of medical overuse has been investigated qualitatively but larger surveys of the public opinion on medical overuse are still missing . Objectives The study aimed to assess the perception of medical overuse , the understanding of reasons and consequences and to evaluate solutions in the general population in Germany . Furthermore , differences in the opinion on medical overuse due to sociodemographic characteristics and participants’ healthcare behavior were investigated . Material and methods Study design and setting An online questionnaire study was conducted . Reporting is based on the STROBE [ 20 ] state - ment for cross - sectional studies and the CHERRIES checklist for Internet E - Surveys [ 21 ] ; available as ( S1 and S2 Files ) . The study was conducted as a cross - sectional study at the Insti - tute of General Practice at Universita¨tsklinikum Erlangen , Germany . A pre - test was performed with seven citizens to evaluate the content , design and functional - ity of the questionnaire . Participants needed to be aged 18 years or older . Participation was vol - untary . The participants of the pre - test were recruited via personal contact . CN and SH discussed all responses and decided whether modifications in the questionnaire would be nec - essary . Only changes in wordings were made . No question was deleted . Participants of the study were recruited via collaboration with Schlesinger Group [ 22 ] , an institute for market research . For sample size calculation G - Power was used [ 23 ] . We assumed that differences in outcomes according to gender and to knowledge of medical overuse prior to the study in the perception of overuse will probably be small ( Cohen’s d = 0 . 2 to 0 . 3 ) . To obtain a type 1 error alpha of maximum 5 % and a power of 80 % using a two - tailed Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney test for two groups , a minimum of 367 fully completed responses in total ( 184 per group ) should be included ( see S3 File ) . Schlesinger Group received the study information and a link to the questionnaire . They dis - tributed both to their study panel . Detailed information on how the study was advertised or presented to the panel and how many people were invited is not available . Participants needed to be aged 18 years or older . Knowledge of the German language was required . The question - naire translation in S4 File was based on a one way translation of German to English . The orig - inal questionnaire in German can be found in S5 File . Some text elements are still provided in German , as these are proper names of existing campaigns . Answering should not take longer than 15 minutes . Schlesinger group compensated the participants via a bonus point system . Quota management was only possible for gender and age . It was performed twice a day by CN using descriptive analysis of age and gender distribution . Recruiting started on March 29 th , PLOS ONE What do peopleknow and think about medicaloveruse ? PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0299907 March 7 , 2024 3 / 17 2022 . We decided to stop data collection after reaching 406 fully completed questionnaires . This target was reached on April 4 th , 2022 after one week of data collection . The software REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) , hosted at Universita¨tsklinikum Erlangen , was used for programming the questionnaire as well as for data collection and man - agement . REDCap is a secure , web - based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies [ 24 , 25 ] . The data were collected anonymously and saved on a secure server , hosted by Universita¨tsklinikum Erlangen . Data will be stored for ten years according to the requirements of the German Research Foundation . Participants needed to give their writ - ten informed consent before continuing . Participating was voluntary . The participants could end the survey at any time by closing the browser tab . Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the Friedrich - Alexander University Erlangen - Nu¨rnberg ( 21 - 434 - S , 14 . 12 . 2021 ) . Measures The questionnaire was developed based on the results of a qualitative study [ 19 ] following the generalization model by Mayring [ 26 ] . The items of the questionnaire are based on partici - pant’s answers of the qualitative study , experts’ opinions and findings of a literature research . [ 12 , 13 , 27 ] . At the beginning detailed information about the study’s objective , survey length and data handling were given in written form . The main part consisted of 45 questions about different topics : ( 1 ) utilization of health care services using single - and multiple - choice questions ; ( 2 ) perception of overuse including understanding and estimation of prevalence using a four - point Likert scale ( from “totally disagree” to “totally agree” ) and relevance using single - choice question ; ( 3 ) personal attitude to medical overuse including reasons , consequences and solu - tions using a four - point Likert - Scale ( from “totally disagree” to “totally agree” ) . In the second part demographic and socio - economic characteristics were collected . To assess morbidity , the Self - Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire ( SCQ - D ) was used in a modified German ver - sion [ 28 , 29 ] . The original questionnaire as well as its translation to English are available as ( S4 and S5 Files ) . Reasons for the chosen design The participants were asked about their own definition of overuse at the beginning to avoid bias by giving them an official definition directly . The official definition given afterwards was meant to create a common ground for all participants . To prevent neutral responses , an even number of categories for the Likert - Scale questions was chosen [ 30 ] . Items were presented in random order when possible to avoid order effect bias [ 31 ] . Participants could not move back in the questionnaire to minimize social desirability [ 32 ] . All questions were programmed to be mandatory . Response pattern indices ( semantic antonyms ) were used to evaluate whether the questionnaire was filled out carefully [ 33 , 34 ] . The method was used within the items 16 . 1 and 16 . 2 . No specific items like cookies or IP - addresses were included to enable identification of double data entry . A similarity check was performed using the inbuilt feature of IBM Statistics SPSS , Version 28 . 0 . 0 . 0 . No identical data entries were found . Data analysis Only fully answered questionnaires were included into the analysis . For statistical analysis the software IBM Statistics SPSS , version 28 . 0 . 0 . 0 was used .

PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0299907 March 7 , 2024 4 / 17 Items on four - point Likert - Scales were considered as ordinally scaled [ 35 ] . Median and inter - quartile range ( IQR ) were computed . For graphical presentation , stacked bar plots were designed using statistic software R ( Version 4 . 2 . 1 ) and R - Studio ( Version 2022 . 07 . 0 ) . For the main topic “Perception of overuse” ( 26 questionnaire items ) group differences based on gender and previous knowledge of overuse were assessed . The selection of gender was based on previous studies [ 36 – 39 ] . It was also assumed that the previous knowledge of overuse might influence peoples’ opinion . Mann - Whitney - U Test was used to compare groups . No adjustment for multiple testing was made due to the exploratory approach of the analysis . To report effect size , Pearson’s r was chosen [ 40 ] . Following Cohen’s recommenda - tions , effect size of Pearson’s r is small if | r | > . 1 , medium if | r | > . 3 and large if | r | > . 5 [ 41 ] . All tests were considered significant with a p - value < . 05 . Answers to open - ended questions 8 and 9 were analyzed and then grouped into four categories : ( 1 ) “no definition given” , comprising answers like “I do not know” or random letters ; ( 2 ) “wrong definition” , if they did not include anything related to medical overuse ; ( 3 ) “more physicians than needed” comprising answers regarding a higher number of physicians than needed and ( 4 ) “Too much medicine , including overtesting and overtreatment” , included all answers , in which the participants mentioned too much medicine . We followed an inductive way of analysis and formed the categories during the analysis . Answers were coded by CN and revised by SH . Results Descriptive analysis Study sample . A total of 540 people registered for the study . Of these 460 ( 85 . 2 % ) peo - ple agreed to participate and 406 ( 75 . 2 % ) fully completed the survey . No participants were excluded due to implausibility . Half of them were female ( n = 210 , 51 . 7 % ) . About 40 % were between 18 and 44 years old ( n = 154 , 37 . 9 % ) , while about 30 % each were between 45 and 64 years old ( n = 127 , 31 . 3 % ) or aged 65 or older ( n = 125 , 30 . 8 % ) . The majority ( n = 341 , 84 . 0 % ) was insured in the statutory health insurance . Most respondents either had a profes - sional training ( n = 213 , 52 . 5 % ) or a university degree ( n = 177 , 43 . 6 % ) . Around two - thirds were employed ( n = 273 , 67 . 2 % ) . Half of the participants lived in cities with more than 100 . 000 inhabitants ( n = 198 , 48 . 8 % ) . On average , participants visited 2 . 46 physicians dur - ing the past three months ( SD = 1 . 80 ) . All sociodemographic characteristics are shown in Table 1 . On average , participants stated they had 1 . 96 health problems ( SD = 1 . 71 ) . Back pain ( n = 132 , 32 . 5 % ) and hypertension ( n = 130 , 32 . 0 % ) were the most frequent ( see S6 File for more detail ) . Understanding of medical overuse . A majority ( M = 237 , 58 . 4 % ) had never heard of medical overuse before . After being presented the official definition , 263 ( 64 . 8 % ) stated they had not previously experienced it . When asked in which two areas of treatments they sus - pected medical overuse most , approximately half of all stated self - pay services ( n = 229 , 56 . 4 % ) , surgical interventions ( n = 184 , 45 . 3 % ) and prescriptions of drugs ( n = 151 , 37 . 2 % ) . Only a small number of participants suspected overuse most in early detection and screening ( n = 32 , 7 . 9 % ) or blood tests ( n = 43 , 10 . 6 % ) . In the open questions , 246 ( 60 . 6 % ) described overuse as too much medicine , including overtesting and overtreatment . About half of the par - ticipants thought that less overuse would improve the health care system ( n = 201 , 49 . 5 % ) . All results can be found in Table 2 . There was broad agreement that overuse involved treatment beyond necessity ( Item 10 . 1 , 34 . 7 % totally agree , 43 . 8 % rather agree ; Item 10 . 3 , 34 . 7 % totally agree , 51 . 7 % rather agree ) . The participants also agreed that overuse refers to procedures which are carried out due to financial reasons ( Item 10 . 4 , 39 . 7 % totally agree , 41 . 9 % rather agree ) . All results are depicted in Fig 1 . PLOS ONE What do peopleknow and think about medicaloveruse ? PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0299907 March 7 , 2024 5 / 17 Perception of medical overuse . Reasons : There was a high degree of agreement that the following items contribute to overuse : availability of medical equipment ( Item 15 . 6 , 29 . 8 % totally agree , 52 . 5 % rather agree ) , reimbursement of medical services ( Item 15 . 8 , 30 . 8 % totally agree , 50 . 7 % rather agree ) and missing coordination between providers ( Item 15 . 7 , 30 . 5 % totally agree , 52 . 2 % rather agree ) . In diagnostics and therapy , the majority of participants seem to expect action rather than a wait - and - see attitude ( Item 15 . 2 , 55 . 2 % rather agree ; Item 15 . 3 , 60 . 1 % rather agree ) . The participants tended to agree that patients themselves are requesting medical services ( Item 15 . 10 , 24 . 1 % totally agree , 58 . 1 % rather agree ) . Consequences : Participants mostly agreed that medical overuse may lead to rising health care costs ( Item 16 . 6 , 40 . 1 % totally agree , 45 . 6 % rather agree ) .

Solutions : Disclosing medical billing ( Item 17 . 2 , 46 . 8 % totally agree , 43 . 3 % rather agree ) , abolishing the coexistence of statutory and private health insurance ( Item 17 . 5 , 42 . 1 % totally agree , 34 . 2 % rather agree ) and providing patients with neutral health information ( Item 17 . 3 , 45 . 1 % totally agree , 47 . 8 % rather agree ) were seen as possible solutions . Also , more physicians treating less patients each ( Item 17 . 4 , 38 . 2 % totally agree , 47 . 5 % rather agree ) and a better cooperation between health care providers were seen as required ( Item 17 . 6 , 50 . 5 % totally agree , 42 . 4 % rather agree ) . However , fewer participants agreed that patients should contribute more to reduce health care costs ( Item 17 . 7 , 18 . 0 % totally agree , 40 . 1 % rather agree ) . The state - ment that patients should see their GP first also had less agreement ( Item 17 . 8 , 15 . 8 % totally agree , 33 . 3 % rather agree ) . Figs 2 – 4 show the results in detail . Existing campaigns to reduce overuse were hardly known ( n = 326 , 80 . 3 % ) . The most known campaign was “Less is more” ( n = 41 , 10 . 1 % ; Klug entscheiden : n = 29 , 7 . 1 % ; Smarter Medicine : n = 19 , 4 . 7 % ; Quarta¨re Pra¨vention ; n = 15 , 3 . 7 % ; Choosing Wisely : n = 11 , 2 . 7 % ) . Multiple campaigns could be chosen . Group differences Gender : Female participants showed higher agreement than males with reasons and solutions for reducing medical overuse that related to structural aspects of the health care system . These are time constraints leading to less information for patients as a reason ( Item 15 . 5 : p = . 008 * , r = - . 13 ) and increasing the number of physicians ( Item 17 . 4 : p = . 008 * , r = - . 13 ) or abolishing Table 2 .

Results of group differences are in S7 File . Discussion Key findings Our aim was to assess the understanding of medical overuse in the German population , what people presume as reasons and consequences and what solutions they would prefer . An online survey was conducted , distributed via an institute for market research in March / April 2022 . The term medical overuse was not familiar to many respondents . If asked , most participants stated that medical overuse , including overtesting , could be seen as treatment beyond medical necessity and medical procedures carried out mainly due to financial reasons . Nearly half agreed that reducing overuse would help to improve the healthcare system . Overuse was mainly suspected in self - pay services , surgeries and prescriptions of drugs but considerably less in diagnostic tests and screening . Participants suspected privately insured citizens to be more affected by overuse than citizens with statutory health insurance . Reasons were attrib - uted to the availability of medical equipment , reimbursement for medical services for physi - cians and missing coordination between health care providers . The majority thought of medical overuse being a reason of rising health care costs and rising insurance premiums . Harms to patients were rated less of a problem . Structural changes as abolishing the coexis - tence of statutory and private health insurance , limiting the numbers of patients seen by physi - cians and disclosing medical billing were seen as an effective way to reduce medical overuse . Existing campaigns aiming to reduce medical overuse were barely known . Previous knowledge of overuse did affect the participants’ tendency to identify components and reasons of overuse . Discussion of findings Similar to other research findings , our participants tended to have a vague and superficial understanding of the concept “medical overuse” [ 16 , 19 , 42 , 43 ] . They seemed to immediately understand the high relevance , but as in other studies did not perceive themselves being affected by medical overuse [ 16 , 19 ] . Participants were more satisfied with medical action than with waiting for symptoms to resolve naturally . As a potential driver , the desire to act instead of a watchful waiting approach as well as the belief that more care is better than less was also mentioned by Morgan et al . ( 2015 ) . Our findings correspond well to the literature in that financial incentives are seen as major drivers [ 4 , 16 – 18 , 44 ] . Other studies also mentioned defensive medicine and to avoid harmful consequences for patients as reasons for overuse [ 4 , 16 – 18 , 44 , 45 ] . In contrast , physical and psychological harms as well as increasing distrust towards physicians were seen as a minor problem . A systematic literature review and a meta - synthesis correspond to these findings [ 16 , 43 ] . Especially cancer screening almost inevitably is leading to overdiagnosis , but our participants seemed not to identify screening services and early detection as being associated with medical overuse as often as other medical procedures . How should they , when these services are even payed for and promoted by health insurance companies and other stakeholders in Germany ? Risks of screening are often neglected , most likely because people predominantly believe that early detection saves lives [ 14 , 43 ] . A large part of the German population supports the idea of abolishing the coexistence of statutory and private health insurance [ 46 ] . However , the current political agenda of the PLOS ONE What do peopleknow and think about medicaloveruse ? PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0299907 March 7 , 2024 10 / 17 elected parties ( coalition agreement ) no longer includes the topic [ 47 ] . Another approach seems to be the alignment of the reimbursement schemes between statutory and private health insurance for outpatient care . The aim would be to diminish financial incentives in overtreat - ment of privately insured patients [ 37 – 39 , 48 ] . Physicians argue that the higher reimbursement for privately insured patients compensates the inappropriately low reimbursements for pub - licly insured patients . Therefore aligning the two schemes is discussed critically [ 49 , 50 ] . Another suggested approach might be to disclose medical billing to the patients and to audit billing more strictly . In the German healthcare system , medical services are delivered to patients widely without copayments or deductibles . Medical bills for publicly insured patients are paid directly by the insurer . These patients , which are by far the majority , rarely know the costs of their treatment [ 37 ] . Increasing the patients’ contribution to the costs of care could be an approach to reduce patient - driven overuse [ 51 ] but it could also lead to patients avoiding medical services due to financial burdens [ 52 ] . Studies indicate that time constraints and inexperience in shared decision - making might also be drivers of medical overuse [ 4 , 17 – 19 , 44 ] . Our results showed that people seemed to be aware of it but that they did not rate it as a major cause . The participants mentioned limiting the number of patients for each physician as a promising approach to reduce medical overuse . Germany , however , already has a high number of physicians per 1 . 000 inhabitants in compari - son to other OECD countries . Since the year 2000 , the number has even risen by about 40 % [ 53 ] . But the number of full - time equivalents has been declining for years , meaning that more physicians overall spend less time treating patients [ 54 , 55 ] . Increasing the number of physi - cians could be an approach but faces the problem of impending shortage of physicians . Also , as long as reimbursement is tied to medical action , physicians might even increase the number of medical procedures for these fewer patient to maintain their revenues . Improving citizens’ knowledge might be a solution . Citizens wish to have more neutral health information , as our and other studies show [ 16 , 19 ] . Campaigns like “Choosing Wisely” or “Klug entscheiden” , which are meant to provide neutral information , have been established but are not widely known in the population [ 19 , 44 ] . More commonly , citizens increasingly tend to use the internet to inform themselves [ 56 , 57 ] . Quality and reliability of online informa - tion , however , can vary from professionally reviewed to personally reported information in blogs to disease mongering driven by financial interests . Citizens might lack the ability to eval - uate these correctly and thus become misinformed , more afraid and uncertain about appropri - ateness of care . Misinformed citizens might request unnecessary care [ 16 , 56 , 57 ] . Raising public awareness of reliable sources might be a first step towards providing citizens with understandable and correct information . Improving the coordination between health care providers would presumably help reduce medical overuse in the participants’ opinion . In Germany , especially inter - sectional interfaces of health care lack coordination . Our participants rated examinations being carried out multiple times by different physicians as drivers for overuse [ 19 , 58 , 59 ] . Other reasons are seen in time constraints , high numbers of patients per physician and legal regulations as well as the low amount of digitalization in the German healthcare system [ 58 ] . Improving digitalization might bear the potential to reduce health care expenditure and unnecessary care [ 60 ] . Electronic sys - tems sharing health care information between all health care sectors are inexistent [ 61 ] . Another cause for difficulties in the coordination between different physicians could also be the so - called dual physician track in Germany , a euphemism for the fact that many physi - cians are caring for the same patients in parallel [ 37 ] . Citizens are almost free to choose the physician they wish to see . Our study participants did not seem to think that implementing a primary care based system would be an appropriate approach to reduce overuse . In the statu - tory health insurance scheme in Germany , it is possible to choose a gate - keeping program on PLOS ONE What do peopleknow and think about medicaloveruse ? PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0299907 March 7 , 2024 11 / 17 voluntary basis , called “general practitioner ( GP ) - centered care” [ 37 ] Only a small amount of the insured actually takes part in the GP - centered care , but a positive trend has been observed [ 62 ] . This leads to the conclusion that people see problems in care coordination but would rather not restrict their own freedom in the choice of their physician . A reason for females agreeing more to items related to structural reasons for and solutions to reduce medical overuse might be that they tend to visit doctors more often ( because of their own complaints or as companions for children or those in need of care ) [ 63 , 64 ] and are thus more likely to perceive structural problems in the health care system than men . Our findings show that knowledge about the concept of medical overuse is linked to a stronger connection with financial causes , consequences and possible solutions . Other studies also show similar trends [ 19 ] . The reason could be the frequently discussed scarce financial resources in the Ger - man health care system [ 65 ] as well as the significant differences in remuneration between the health insurance systems , which may lead to a preference for financially lucrative services and patients [ 37 – 39 , 48 ] . Strengths and limitations Our study was the first in Germany to evaluate citizens understanding of medical overuse in a quantitative design . The questionnaire was designed systematically following the results of dif - ferent qualitative analyses [ 12 , 13 , 19 , 27 ] . The questionnaire was tested in a pre - test . The pre - test was conducted to evaluate the design and technical functionality as well as the compre - hensibility and relevance of the questionnaire . Validity and reliability measurements were not included . The study design only allowed assessing the participants’ attitudes towards medical overuse but not their actual behavior . However , within limits it is possible to draw conclusions from attitude to behavior . We did not perform any specific methods in sample collection that would guarantee representativeness of our results . However , age and gender distribution as well as the distribution of the participants’ employment status almost met the real distribution in Germany . Privately insured persons were slightly overrepresented . The percentage of partic - ipants with university degree was slightly more than twice as high as the percentage in the Ger - man population . People with no professional education ( yet ) were underrepresented . It was not possible to steer data collection according to these criteria . The results only showed effect sizes in a range from . 13 to . 20 . We estimated an effect size ranging from . 20 to . 30 and calcu - lated the needed sample size accordingly . Further studies should probably make the assump - tion that sociodemographic characteristics might only account for marginal differences in peoples’ attitudes and therefore would require a larger sample size . The survey was designed as an online survey . Participation therefore required certain tech - nical skills and the availability of technical devices and internet access . An institute of market research carried out the data collection . Their study panels might limit the representativeness of the results . The participants also received an incentive in form of bonus points for complet - ing the survey . It is possible that they answered the questionnaire not carefully to complete it in a short amount of time and receive the incentive . Answers were checked for implausible pat - terns . No identifiers were included to enable checking for multiple data entry . IBM Statistics SPSS allowed performing a similarity check , which did not indicate any identical data . Inspect - ing the free text questions showed highly similar responses which might indicate that some individuals filled out the questionnaire more than once . We therefore cannot exclude double data entry . In the open - ended question about the participants’ definition of overuse , it must be remembered that these could only be answered in short key points . There was no in - depth analysis to assess the participants’ understanding of the term “medical overuse” . It was further - more not possible to check whether an internet search was carried out to answer the questions . PLOS ONE What do peopleknow and think about medicaloveruse ? PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0299907 March 7 , 2024 12 / 17 The survey was only presented in German language . We advised participants not to have the website translated automatically , as this can lead to errors in the translation . However , we could not check whether this advice was listened to . We also could not check whether the par - ticipants had sufficient knowledge of the German language to understand the questionnaire correctly . Misunderstandings can therefore not be ruled out . Nonetheless , findings should be interpreted with caution as generalization might be reduced . The voluntary participation can lead to a potential bias as it can be assumed that mostly citizens who are interested in medical overuse and research in general might have been more likely to respond to our questionnaire , skewing the sample . Conclusion Citizens in Germany are little familiar with the term “medical overuse” but seem to grasp its meaning immediately . They tend to link medical overuse mainly to financial incentives . Medi - cal overuse was suspected more in medical procedures with high remuneration and less in imaging or screening procedures . Respondents seemed to rate medical action positively and underestimate the physical and psychological harms possibly resulting from it . Patients were identified as potential causes for medical overuse , but the participants did not include them - selves in the group of patients who drive overuse . Approaches to avoid medical overuse are only seen in reducing financial incentives and redesigning the German health insurance schemes . The idea of implementing a primary health care system gets little agreement . Increas - ing the awareness of medical overuse might be an important step forward . Awareness of the direct harms of medical overuse for patients should be strengthened . Supporting information S1 Fig . Sample size calculation . ( TIF ) S1 Table . Study data . ( CSV ) S1 File .
