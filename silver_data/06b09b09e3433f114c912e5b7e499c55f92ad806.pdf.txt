The adaptor - 45 protein AP - 1 complex operates as part of the secretory pathway at the trans - Golgi 46 network , while the AP - 2 complex and the TPLATE complex ( TPC ) jointly operate at the 47 plasma membrane to execute clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Key to our further 48 understanding of clathrin - mediated trafficking in plants will be the comprehensive 49 identification and characterization of the network of evolutionarily conserved and plant - 50 specific core and accessory machinery involved in the formation and targeting of CCVs . 51 To facilitate these studies , we have analyzed the proteome of enriched trans - Golgi 52 network / early endosome - derived and endocytic CCVs isolated from dividing and 53 expanding suspension - cultured Arabidopsis cells . Tandem mass spectrometry analysis 54 results were validated by differential chemical labeling experiments to identify proteins 55 co - enriching with CCVs . Proteins enriched in CCVs included previously characterized 56 CCV components and cargos such as the vacuolar sorting receptors in addition to 57 conserved and plant - specific components whose function in clathrin - mediated trafficking 58 has not been previously defined . Notably , in addition to AP - 1 and AP - 2 , all subunits of the 59 AP - 4 complex , but not AP - 3 or AP - 5 , were found to be in high abundance in the CCV 60 proteome . The association of AP - 4 with suspension - cultured Arabidopsis CCVs is further 61 supported via additional biochemical data . 62 4 Introduction 63 Vesicle trafficking is critical for the exchange of materials between the various 64 biochemically and functionally distinct compartments of the biosynthetic / secretory and 65 endocytic pathways . In particular , the trafficking of vacuolar proteins and the polar 66 localization of plasma membrane proteins is critical for nutrient uptake , pathogen 67 response , and organismal homeostasis . 68 Fundamental to the process of vesicle trafficking is the assembly of cytosolic coat 69 protein complexes which cluster cargo and generate the membrane curvature necessary 70 for a budding vesicle ( Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ; Robinson , 2015 ) . The distinctive 71 geometric lattice that surrounds clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) is composed of clathrin 72 triskelia comprised of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) and clathrin light chain ( CLC ) subunits . 73 Since their initial discovery in metazoans and plants ( Gray , 1961 ; Roth and Porter , 74 1964 ; Bonnett and Newcomb , 1966 ) , CCVs have been demonstrated to function in 75 endocytosis ( Robinson , 2015 ; Reynolds et al . , 2018 ) and post - Golgi trafficking ( Orci et 76 al . , 1985 ; Hirst et al . , 2012 ) . The highly choreographed multi - step process of clathrin - 77 mediated endocytosis ( CME ) requires clathrin and a large number of endocytic accessory 78 proteins ( EAPs ) that function at specific sites on the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( i . e . clathrin - 79 coated pits ) to mediate cargo recruitment , membrane invagination , scission / severing of 80 the nascent clathrin - coated vesicle from the PM and their uncoating prior to fusion with 81 endosomes ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Wu and Wu , 2021 ; Taylor et al . 2011 ) . Our 82 current understanding of the complex network of proteins and lipids required for post - 83 Golgi trafficking and endocytosis in plants largely comes from yeast and mammalian 84 systems and the use of various biochemical , proteomic , genetic , and advanced 85 quantitative live - cell imaging approaches . By comparison , mechanistic insight into 86 clathrin - dependent membrane trafficking in plants remains limited . 87 CCVs facilitate multiple intracellular trafficking pathways via the action of adaptor 88 protein complexes which are tasked with pathway - specific cargo recognition and clathrin 89 recruitment at the PM and endomembrane compartments . The first clathrin adaptors to 90 be identified were the assembly polypeptide ( AP ) - 2 and AP - 1 heterotetrameric complexes 91 ( Pearse and Robinson , 1984 ; Keen , 1987 ) that interact with protein cargo and specific 92 phospholipids residing at the plasma membrane and the trans - Golgi Network ( TGN ) , 93 5 respectively ( Robinson , 2015 ) . Work has demonstrated that these functions are largely 94 conserved in plants including the central role of AP - 2 in endocytosis ( Bashline et al . , 2013 ; 95 Di Rubbo et al . , 2013 ; Fan et al . , 2013 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) and of AP - 1 in trafficking at TGN 96 / early endosomes ( TGN / EE ) ( Song et al . , 2006 ; Park et al . , 2013 ; Teh et al . , 2013 ) . The 97 latter’s function is somewhat more complex as the plant TGN / EE appears to be comprised 98 of numerous distinct sub - compartments with varying morphologies and functions in 99 contrast to its metazoan counterpart ( Dettmer et al . , 2006 ; Viotti et al . , 2010 ; Kang et al . , 100 2011 ; Rosquete et al . , 2018 ; Shimizu , et al . , 2021 ; Heinze , et al . 2020 ) . Moreover , an 101 increasing number of studies have demonstrated that these core CCV trafficking proteins 102 have evolved to accommodate processes critical for plant growth and development 103 against the differing biophysical properties of plant cells including cell wall formation , 104 cytokinesis , and pathogen response ( Ekanayake et al . , 2019 ; McMichael and Bednarek , 105 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ; Gu et al . , 2017 ) . 106 In addition to AP - 2 and AP - 1 , three additional AP complexes , AP - 3 ( Dell ' Angelica 107 et al . , 1997 ; Simpson et al . , 1997 ; Zwiewka et al . , 2011 ) , AP - 4 ( Dell ' Angelica et al . , 1999 ; 108 Hirst et al . , 1999 ) , and AP - 5 ( Hirst et al . , 2013 ) mediate post - Golgi endomembrane 109 trafficking in multicellular eukaryotes . However , relative to AP - 1 and AP - 2 , their 110 interaction with the clathrin machinery in mammalian and other systems is less defined . 111 Proteomic analyses of mammalian CCVs suggest that of the five evolutionarily conserved 112 adaptor complexes , only AP - 1 and AP - 2 were found to be associated with the clathrin 113 coat ( Borner , et al . 2012 , Blondeau , et al . PNAS 2004 ) . Recent super - resolution 114 microscopy of plant cells showed a lack of colocalization between AP4 and clathrin 115 ( Shimizu et al . , 2021 ) . Lastly , the association of AP - 5 with clathrin metazoan and plants 116 remains undetermined ( Sanger et al . , 2019 ) . 117 Plants have shown evolutionary divergence in their key EAPs compared to other 118 model systems including , for example , the TPLATE complex ( TPC ) , which likely evolved 119 in early eukaryotes but is notably absent from yeast and metazoans and which is essential 120 for plant clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Hirst , et al . , 2014 ; Wang , 121 et al . , 2021 ; Bashline , et al . , 2015 ) . Similar to AP - 2 , TPC functions exclusively at the PM 122 and acts as a central interaction hub required for the formation of endocytic CCVs 123 ( Gadeyne , et al . , 2014 ; Wang , et al . 2016 ; Zhang , et al . , 2015 ; Yperman , et al . , 2021 ) . 124 6 Additional conserved accessory proteins have been demonstrated to be required for CCV 125 maturation including monomeric cargo adaptor families such as the ENTH / ANTH / VHS 126 domain containing proteins which aid in cargo recognition and membrane deformation 127 ( Zouhar and Sauer , 2014 ; Fujimoto , 2020 ) . In addition , CCV formation requires members 128 of Arabidopsis dynamin related protein families DRP1s and DRP2s , which are necessary 129 for scission of the budding vesicle from the plasma membrane ( Bednarek and Backues , 130 2010 ) . DRP1 and DRP2 protein assembly into clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) is critical for 131 efficient CME and cell plate biogenesis but the precise mechanistic details of their 132 function ( s ) in these processes are not fully established ( Fujimoto , et al . , 2010 ; 133 Narasimhan , et al . , 2020 ; Ekanayake , et al . , 2021 ; Mravec , et al . , 2011 ; Backues , et al . 134 2010 ; Konopka , et al . , 2008 ) . Various plant uncoating factors have been identified , and 135 the mechanistic details are under investigation ( Robinson , 2015 ; Adamowski et al . , 2018 ) . 136 Trafficking factors including Rab and ARF - related small GTPases ( Jurgens et al . , 137 2015 ; Lipatova et al . , 2015 ; Takemoto et al . , 2018 ) , vesicle tethering complexes ( Jurgens 138 et al . , 2015 ; Takemoto et al . , 2018 ) , and soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor 139 adaptor protein receptors ( SNARE ) proteins ( Yun and Kwon , 2017 ) add complexity to the 140 regulation of clathrin - mediated trafficking pathways . 141 Defining the protein complement of post - Golgi and endocytic CCVs will further 142 enhance our understanding of the evolutionarily conserved and plant - specific core and 143 accessory machinery involved in the formation and targeting of plant clathrin - coated 144 vesicles . Organelle proteomics is a useful tool for such studies as it can provide a global 145 view of the protein content of a particular organelle thereby placing known and un - 146 annotated gene products in a functional context . Several studies have employed mass 147 spectrometry ( MS ) to answer questions of mammalian CCV content including analyses 148 of rat brain CCVs to examine their role in synaptic vesicle recycling ( Takamori et al . , 2006 ; 149 Blondeau et al . , 2004 ) and of those isolated from HeLa cells ( Borner et al . , 2006 ; Borner 150 et al . , 2012 ) . In addition to the identification of previously unknown CCV components , the 151 relative abundance of proteins across CCVs isolated from rat brain and liver has been 152 examined to interrogate pathway - specific proteins such as AP - 1 and AP - 2 subunits 153 ( functioning in secretion and endocytosis , respectively ) and the proportion of CCVs 154 involved in post - Golgi and endocytic trafficking in different cell types ( Girard et al . , 2005 ) . 155 7 In plants , subcellular fractionation coupled with tandem MS has also been utilized to 156 elucidate the protein content of endomembrane compartments including Arabidopsis 157 Golgi cisternae ( Parsons et al . , 2012 ; Okekeogbu et al . , 2019 ; Parsons et al . , 2019 ) , 158 vacuoles ( Carter et al . , 2004 ) , and syntaxin of plants 61 ( SYP61 ) - positive TGN 159 compartments ( Drakakaki et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we report the proteomic assessment of 160 CCVs isolated from undifferentiated Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells using tandem 161 mass spectrometry and quantitative immunoblotting to elucidate the ensemble of proteins 162 underlying clathrin - mediated trafficking in plants and to better understand the similarities 163 and differences among trafficking protein pathways within eukaryotes . 164 165 8 Results / Discussion 166 167 CCV Isolation 168 In plants , CCVs mediate trafficking of secretory and endocytic cargo necessary for cell 169 expansion , cytokinesis , nutrient uptake , and pathogen immunity pathways underlying 170 growth , morphogenesis , and defense in a variety of developmentally - distinct cell types 171 ( Reynolds et al . , 2018 ; Ekanayake , et al . , 2019 ) . Undifferentiated suspension - cultured 172 plant cells offer , however , several benefits as a biological sample source for proteomic 173 analysis of plant CCVs as they : 1 ) display high levels of division and expansion , 174 processes that require a large flux of vesicular trafficking ; 2 ) are easily scaled to provide 175 large amounts of material ; and 3 ) when grown under constant conditions , provide a 176 population of cells uniform in cell type and development between biological replicates . 177 With these features in mind , CCVs used for proteomic analysis in this study were isolated 178 from 3 - 4 day - old T87 suspension - cultured Arabidopsis cells ( Axelos et al . , 1992 ) . In 179 addition , the availability of the Arabidopsis genome sequence and in silico proteome 180 ( Arabidopsis Genome , 2000 ; Berardini et al . , 2015 ) as well as the T87 transcriptome 181 datasets ( Stolc et al . , 2005 ) facilitate the assessment of the enrichment or depletion of 182 proteins of interest in the CCV proteome . 183 For proteomic analyses , plant CCVs were isolated under pH conditions that inhibit 184 clathrin cage disassembly using a fractionation scheme that includes differential , rate - 185 zonal centrifugation , and a final equilibrium deuterium / Ficoll gradient as described 186 previously ( Reynolds et al . , 2014 ) . Prior to mass spectrometry analysis , the composition 187 and quality of CCV preparations were assessed by morphological analysis using 188 transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and immunoblotting for protein markers of the 189 secretory and endocytic pathways . TEM analysis ( Figure 1A ) of the enriched clathrin - 190 coated vesicle samples revealed that 65 % and 48 % of the vesicles in two independent 191 replicates were coated and displayed the characteristic geometry of clathrin coats with a 192 diameter of 70 nm . Scanning transmission electron micrographs of enriched CCVs at 193 higher resolution show striking symmetry of the coat ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . 194 195 CCV MS / MS Sample Preparation & Analysis 196 9 To establish a comprehensive understanding of the protein composition of plant CCVs , 197 two independent , parallel proteomic workflows were performed on enriched CCV protein 198 samples ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . In the first methodology , CCVs isolated from four 199 independent biological replicates were resolved via one - dimensional SDS - PAGE before 200 in - gel digestion of proteins by trypsin and subjection to LC / MS - MS . To account for 201 differences in protein sampling related to 1D SDS - PAGE sample fractionation and the 202 use of detergents , we used a second methodology in which three independent CCV 203 preparations were denatured in a urea buffer prior to trypsin digestion in - solution and 204 separation of recovered peptides by LC / MS - MS . 205 Coomassie staining of a representative enriched CCV fraction separated by 1D 206 SDS - PAGE is shown in Figure 2A . Gel slices 2 , 6 , and 8 contain bands of high protein 207 abundance ( intense Coomassie staining ) which migrate at rates corresponding to the 208 molecular weights of the clathrin coat proteins . To confirm the identity of the specific 209 heavy or light chain clathrin isoforms in each polyacrylamide gel slice , we plotted the 210 unique spectral counts as a percentage of unique spectral counts for that isoform across 211 the entire SDS - PAGE gel and showed that the protein abundances in gel slices 2 , 6 , and 212 8 in Figure 2A corresponded to the presence of clathrin subunits ( Figure 2B ) . Arabidopsis 213 encodes two CHC isoforms , CHC1 and CHC2 , of approximately the same mass ( 193kD ) 214 which share > 90 % sequence identity ( Kitakura et al . , 2011 ) and are transcribed at 215 comparable levels in T87 suspension cultured cells ( Stolc et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast to 216 CHC , the three Arabidopsis CLC isoforms share only ~ 55 % sequence identity ( Wang et 217 al . , 2013 ) and vary in predicted mass ( 37 . 2 , 28 . 8 , and 29 . 1 kD , CLC1 - 3 , respectively ) . 218 The spectral count and SDS - PAGE data confirmed that clathrin heavy chain contributes 219 towards the high protein abundance of gel slice 2 ( predicted molecular weight of CHC1 220 and CHC2 , 193 kDa ) , and that clathrin light chain contribute towards the protein 221 abundance of gel slices 6 and 8 ( predicted molecular weight of CLC1 , 37 kDa ; of CLC2 222 and CLC3 , 29 kDa ) . The identities of the other CCV - associated proteins in Figure 2A with 223 abundances below the limits of detection by Coomassie staining were determined by 224 proteomic and immunoblot analyses addressed below . 225 To define the CCV proteome , protein or protein group assignments were 226 considered true if unique peptides denoting the protein or protein group were found in at 227 10 least two biological replicates based on a 1 % false discovery rate protein threshold and 228 unique peptide assignments at 95 % confidence ( first methodology ; Materials & Methods 229 and Supplemental Figure 1B ) or at a 1 % false discovery rate protein and peptide threshold 230 ( second methodology ; see Materials & Methods and Supplemental Figure 1C ) . 231 Processed spectra from the first proteomic analysis were matched against the 232 Arabidopsis protein sequence database using the Mascot searching algorithm ( Perkins 233 et al . , 1999 ) , while in the second approach , MS / MS spectra were analyzed with the 234 MaxQuant software package . 235 Following these criteria , protein assignments from the four independent CCV 236 preparations analyzed by Method 1 ( in which CCVs were separated by 1D SDS - PAGE ) 237 comprised a list of 3 , 548 proteins ( Supplemental Dataset 1 ) , the vast majority of which 238 ( ~ 72 % ) were in relatively low abundance ( < 50 spectral counts across four replicates ) . 239 Total spectral counts have previously been used as an approximation of overall protein 240 abundance in biological samples for those proteins with a reasonably high ( > 10 - 20 ) total 241 number of counts ( Lundgren et al . , 2010 ) . Accordingly , we compared total counts over 242 four biological replicates without normalization as an approximation of overall protein 243 abundance within CCVs and focused our analysis on those proteins with the highest 244 associated spectral count totals . The proteomic data from CCVs fractionated by 1D SDS - 245 PAGE and analyzed by tandem MS is presented in Supplemental Datasets 1 and 4 and 246 Figures 2A , 2B , 3 , and 5 . Protein assignments obtained from the second CCV 247 methodology resulted in a list of 1 , 981 protein groups ( Supplemental Dataset 2 ) . Intensity 248 based absolute quantitation ( iBAQ ) values were used to sort protein groups within this 249 dataset , as this method of label - free quantification method has been previously judged to 250 be a metric for protein abundances within biological samples and enables comparison of 251 these abundances ( Arike , et al . 2012 ; Nagaraj , et al . 2011 ; Schwanhausser , et al . 2011 ) . 252 The data from this second methodology is presented in Supplemental Datasets 2 and 4 253 and Figures 2C and 3 . 254 Previous proteomic studies of CCVs purified from mammalian tissue have found 255 that clathrin light and heavy chains exist in a stoichiometric 1 : 1 ratio , but also as non - 256 stoichiometric ratios depending on the tissue and species source of the CCV sample 257 ( Borner , et al . 2012 ; Blondeau , et al . 2004 ; Girard , et al . 2005 ) . We used iBAQ levels to 258 11 analyze the abundances of clathrin heavy and light chain subunits and determine the ratio 259 of subunits within the triskelion independently of immunoblotting based methods . We 260 summed the iBAQ values for clathrin heavy chain subunits and for clathrin light chain 261 subunits for each independent replicate and took the ratio between these values as the 262 measure of CLC : CHC per replicate of 1 . 24 , 2 . 05 , and 1 . 07 ( Figure 2C ; Supplemental 263 Dataset 2 ) . These values generally support a 1 : 1 ratio but suggest that , in some CCV 264 preparations from plant cells , clathrin light chain subunits are in excess . 265 The numbers of proteins comprising each proteomic dataset and shared between 266 both sample preparations described above are illustrated in Figure 3 . Cross - referencing 267 the datasets derived from these independent , parallel workflows established an 268 overlapping CCV proteome comprising 1 , 663 proteins . 269 270 Assessment of Protein Enrichment and Depletion in CCV Fraction 271 To further refine the CCV proteome , we quantitatively compared the abundance of 272 peptides in pre - and post - deuterium / Ficoll gradient samples , termed Deuterium Ficoll 273 Gradient Load ( DFGL ) and CCV samples , respectively . To do so , we assessed the 274 relative enrichment or depletion of proteins identified by mass spectrometry in an 275 unbiased manner through a differential labeling strategy with stable isotope dimethyl 276 moieties ( Boersema et al . , 2009 ) . This methodology involves the reaction of peptide 277 primary amines with either formaldehyde or deuterated formaldehyde to form methylated 278 peptides , which results in identical peptides treated in this way differing by 4 Daltons . 279 Accordingly , a quantitative ratio of an individual peptide’s abundance in the DFGL relative 280 to the final enriched CCV preparation , as represented by spectral counts , can be derived . 281 DFGL and CCV fractions from two independent biological replicates were 282 separated by 1D SDS - PAGE prior to gel sectioning and in - gel digestion with trypsin . 283 Peptides from both fractions were recovered and treated with dimethyl reagents as 284 previously described ( Boersema et al . , 2009 ) . In the second replicate , heavy ( deuterated ) 285 and light labels applied to CCV and DFGL samples were swapped to control for potential 286 discrepancies resulting in the identification of proteins which were enriched in 287 ( CCV : DFGL spectral count ratio ≥ 2 . 0 ) or depleted from ( DFGL : CCV spectral count ratio 288 ≥ 2 . 0 ) the purified clathrin - coated vesicles ( Figure 3 , Supplementary Dataset 3 ) . Cross - 289 12 referencing these datasets yielded a core set of 778 proteins in the enriched CCV 290 purification sample as detected by all three proteomic workflows , 213 ( 27 % ) of which had 291 a CCV : DFGL spectral count ratio ≥ 2 . 0 , i . e . were enriched more than two - fold in the final 292 preparatory step resulting in purified clathrin - coated vesicles ( Figure 3 , Supplemental 293 Dataset 3 ) . 294 In previous studies , immunoblotting has been used to validate differential 295 centrifugation as a means to purify clathrin - coated vesicles from plant cells by confirming 296 the depletion of markers of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi , as well as of other 297 organelles including plastids , peroxisomes , and mitochondria , in addition to confirming 298 the enrichment of CCV associated proteins ( McMichael et al . , 2013 ; Reynolds et al 2014 ) . 299 However , the fold enrichment or depletion of these proteins relative to their initial 300 abundance in the lysate ( S0 . 1 ) fraction has not been quantified . Here , we performed 301 quantitative immunoblotting of equal amounts of protein from steps throughout the CCV 302 purification process , including the DFGL and CCV fractions , to establish the fold 303 enrichment and depletion of CCV mediated trafficking - associated and unassociated 304 proteins , respectively , relative to the lysate ( Figure 4 ) . We then used the average fold 305 enrichments between the DFGL and CCV fractions from three independent quantitative 306 immunoblotting experiments ( apart from immunoblotting for DRP2 , where n = 2 ) to 307 corroborate the values obtained by the dimethyl labeling proteomic workflow ( Table 1 ) . 308 The expected enrichment of CCV associated proteins , such as clathrin coat 309 proteins CHC and CLC2 and subunits of AP - 1 and AP - 2 complexes , as well as the cell 310 plate , TGN , and putative CCV cargo marker , KNOLLE ( Boutte et al . 2010 ; Dhonukshe et 311 al . 2006 ; Reichardt et al . 2007 ) , is shown in Figure 4A . To demonstrate the removal of 312 non - CCV trafficking associated proteins from the purified CCVs , the depletion of cFBPase 313 and SEC12 proteins , markers for the cytosol and ER , respectively , between the S0 . 1 314 fraction and final CCV sample , is shown in Figure 4B . We also quantitated the intensity 315 of the proteins in Figures 4A and 4B at the DFGL and CCV steps of the CCV purification 316 scheme and compared these values to those obtained in the dimethyl labeling experiment 317 ( Table 1 ) . The average fold enrichment values between the CCV and DFGL samples for 318 the proteins in Figures 4A and 4B as determined by immunoblotting or dimethyl labeling 319 are compared in Table 1 , which shows that the general trends of enrichment of CCV 320 13 associated proteins and depletion of markers of subcellular compartments not associated 321 with CCV - mediated trafficking away from the final CCV sample are consistent across both 322 methods . These quantitative immunoblotting data support the use of the dimethyl labeling 323 proteomic dataset ( Supplemental Dataset 3 ) as a tool for researchers investigating 324 proteins of interest and the strength of potential connections to CCV mediated trafficking 325 processes . 326 To assess the contributions of subcellular organelles to the complement of 539 327 proteins that were depleted at least 2 - fold during the final CCV purification step , their 328 predicted subcellular localizations were determined using the SUBAcon ( SUBcellular 329 Arabidopsis consensus ) bioinformatics tool , an algorithm which integrates experimental 330 fluorescent and proteomic data , as well as computational prediction algorithms to identify 331 a likely protein location ( Hooper , et al . 2014 ) ( Supplemental Dataset 5 ) . The average fold 332 depletion of each of the 539 proteins sorted by subcellular localization as identified by 333 SUBAcon is shown in Figure 5A , and the contribution of each organelle to the abundance 334 of spectral counts represented in the 539 protein depletion - dataset is depicted in Figure 335 5B . Approximately 54 % of depleted spectra were attributed to proteins associated with 336 the cytoplasm and other organelles likely not directly participating in clathrin - mediated 337 trafficking , such as the endoplasmic reticulum ( Fig . 5B ) . Demonstrating the effectiveness 338 of the deuterium / Ficoll gradient , approximately 31 % and 4 % of all spectra corresponding 339 to peptides more abundant in the DFGL relative to the final post centrifugation CCV 340 fraction ( i . e . peptides indicating the 539 depleted proteins ) were attributed to components 341 of the ribosome and 26S proteasome , respectively . 342 Manual annotation of the 256 proteins that were enriched at least 2 - fold in the final 343 CCV fraction relative to the deuterium / Ficoll gradient load is depicted in Figure 5C . The 344 fold enrichment and total spectral count are plotted for the enriched proteins sorted by 345 manually assigned category relating to their roles in CCV trafficking . The fold enrichment 346 and abundance of specific categories of CCV associated proteins will be discussed 347 further below . 348 349 VALIDATION OF CCV - ASSOCIATED PROTEINS 350 Clathrin 351 14 Morphological and SDS - PAGE analyses demonstrated that clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) 352 and light chain ( CLC ) subunits were highly enriched in the CCV preparations ( Figures 1A 353 and 2A ) . Consistent with this , 42 % of all spectra assigned to peptides corresponding to 354 the 256 proteins that were enriched in the CCV fraction corresponded to the core clathrin 355 coat components , namely CHC and CLC ( Figure 5C ) . CHC1 and CHC2 were enriched 6 - 356 and 5 - fold , respectively , in CCVs compared to the DFGL ( Table 1 , Supplemental Dataset 357 4 ) , which is comparable to their 3 - fold DFGL to CCV enrichment observed via quantitative 358 immunoblotting ( Figures 4A and 4C ) . CLC1 - 3 were 8 - , 18 - , and 9 - fold enriched in CCVs 359 relative to the DFGL in dimethyl labeling experiments ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) while 360 quantitative immunoblotting with αCLC2 antibody supported an enrichment for the CLC2 361 isoform in the final CCV fraction ( Table 1 , Figures 4A and 4C ) . 362 363 The AP - 1 , AP - 2 , and TPC Hetero - oligomeric Adaptor Protein Complexes 364 Subunits of the previously - characterized multimeric adaptor protein complexes AP - 2 , 365 TPC , and AP - 1 underlying endocytic and post - Golgi clathrin - dependent trafficking , 366 respectively , were also identified in the suspension - cultured cell CCV proteome . All 367 subunits , including large ( A , B , G ) , medium ( M ) , and small ( S ) proteins , of the canonical , 368 conserved heterotetrameric adaptin AP - 1 and AP - 2 complexes were detected in our 369 datasets in high abundance , accounting for 16 % of all spectra assigned to peptides 370 enriched in CCVs in dimethyl labeling experiments ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . AP1G and 371 AP2A were 6 - and 3 - fold more abundant in CCVs relative to the DFGL as observed by 372 dimethyl labeling ( Table 1 and Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . Consistent with this , AP1G was 373 found to be enriched 2 - fold and AP2A present in the final CCV fraction as found via 374 quantitative immunoblotting ( Table 1 , Figures 4A and 4C ) , indicating that the enriched 375 CCV preparations are a mixed population of post - Golgi and PM - derived CCVs . While 376 both AP1G1 and AP1G2 paralogs were detected in the dimethyl labeling replicates at an 377 enrichment of about 5 - fold , only one of two AP2A paralogs , AP2A2 , was detected in the 378 labeling studies at an enrichment of 2 . 6 - fold , suggesting that AP2A1 is less abundant in 379 the suspension cultured cell CCV fraction . The medium and small subunits of the AP - 1 380 and AP - 2 complexes were enriched 3 - fold or greater as were the AP - 1 / 2 B1 and B2 large 381 subunits ( 6 - and 4 - fold enrichment ; Supplemental Dataset 4 ) , which , similar to the case 382 15 in Dictyostelium ( Sosa et al . , 2012 ) have been postulated to be interchangeably 383 associated with AP - 1 and AP - 2 complexes in plants ( Bassham et al . , 2008 ) . Efforts in 384 recent years have established that the role of AP - 1 in the trafficking of vacuolar cargo and 385 clathrin recruitment in plant cells resembles that observed in yeast and mammalian 386 systems . AP1M isoform mutants ( ap1m1 and ap1m2 ) both show defects in trafficking of 387 the soluble vacuolar protease precursor proaleurain ( Song et al . , 2006 ; Park et al . , 2013 ) . 388 In addition , the AP - 1 complex is critical for proper targeting of membrane - bound cargo to 389 the tonoplast , at least partially via cytoplasmic sorting signals such as the N - terminal 390 dileucine motif found in VACUOLAR ION TRANSPORTER1 ( VIT1 ) , which is mislocalized 391 to the PM in ap1g mutants ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . TGN / EE integrity is however comprised 392 in ap1 mutants , which manifests not only in defects in vacuolar protein transport but in 393 exocytic trafficking to the plasma membrane and cell plate , as well as clathrin - mediated 394 endocytosis ( Park et al . 2013 ; Yan et al . 2021 ) . 395 Recent characterization of the plant - specific TPC has revealed that the complex 396 functions in endocytosis in concert with clathrin and AP - 2 ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Bashline 397 et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2016 ) . The two adapter complexes likely 398 have overlapping as well as distinct functions ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Narasimhan et al . , 399 2020 ; Johnson et al . bioRxiv 10 . 1101 / 2021 . 04 . 26 . 441441 ) . Consistent with the former , 400 both AP - 2 and TPC bind clathrin and have been shown to interact with a common 401 endocytic cargo protein , CESA6 ( Bashline et al . , 2013 ; Sanchez - Rodriguez et al . , 2018 ) , 402 one of three CESAs identified in the CCV proteome ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . However , 403 compared to ap2 mutants , loss - of - function TPC subunit mutants display more severe 404 biological phenotypic defects including pollen lethality ( Van Damme et al . , 2006 ; Gadeyne 405 et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , given the essential nature of TPC in plant CME and the absence of 406 homologs of most TPC subunits in yeast and metazoans , TPC is critical for functions 407 unique to plants ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . In our studies , mass spectrometry analysis identified 408 all eight core TPC subunits in the proteome derived from 1D SDS - PAGE separated CCVs 409 ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . However , unlike the subunits of the heterotetrameric AP - 1 and 410 AP - 2 complexes , which all enriched in the CCV relative to DFGL fraction , the enrichment 411 of the core TPC subunits were generally lower . Although the enrichment values of TPC 412 subunits , TML and TASH3 , were somewhat higher than those of the other subunits of 413 16 TPC ( e . g . TPLATE ) , no TPC subunit was strongly enriched in the last CCV purification 414 step as detected by immunoblotting or dimethyl labeling ( Table 1 and Supplemental 415 Dataset 4 ) . Consistent with recent data from Johnson et al . showing that TPC is 416 structurally more external to endocytic CCVs than AP - 2 , localizing around clathrin and 417 AP2 , and that TPC is loosely associated with purified CCV ( Johnson et al . bioRxiv ) , the 418 EH domain - containing proteins EH1 and EH2 were present in the CCV proteome and 419 similarly neither enriched alongside the vesicles as measured by the dimethyl labeling 420 experiments ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . However , two ENTH - domain - containing TPC 421 accessory components ( AtECA4 and CAP1 ) were found in comparatively high abundance 422 in CCVs ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . Given that ENTH proteins directly interact with 423 membranes ( Zouhar and Sauer , 2014 ) , AtECA4 and CAP1 may be retained on CCVs to 424 a larger extent than the core TPC . These data may explain why TPC components do not 425 enrich to the degree of AP - 2 subunits between the DFGL and CCV steps as measured 426 by dimethyl labeling or immunoblotting , in that TPC subunits may have dissociated from 427 the purified CCV . The abundance of TPC core and accessory proteins identified did not 428 differ based on CCV sample preparation , including a similar enrichment of AtECA4 and 429 CAP1 in CCVs relative to TPC core subunits ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . 430 431 The AP - 4 adapter complex , but not AP - 3 and AP - 5 , is associated with CCVs 432 In addition to the known clathrin associated heterooligomeric adapter complexes , AP - 1 , 433 AP - 2 and TPC , the detection of all subunits of the less - studied AP - 4 complex ( AP4E , B , 434 M , S ) and the abundance thereof at levels comparable to that of AP - 1 and AP - 2 are 435 notable in the CCV proteome ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . The enrichment of the AP4E 436 large subunit in CCV preparations was similar to that of AP2A and AP1G subunits ( 4 . 6 - , 437 2 . 6 - , and 5 . 6 - fold CCV : DFGL ratios , respectively ) as was the medium AP4M subunit 438 relative to those corresponding to AP - 2 and AP - 1 ( 3 . 2 - , 2 . 9 - , and 5 . 9 - fold , respectively ) 439 as determined by differential labeling experiments ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . In 440 mammals , AP4M was not detected by immunoblotting in purified CCVs and the AP - 4 441 complex was revealed to associate with non - clathrin - coated vesicles near the TGN via 442 immunogold electron microscopy ( Hirst et al . , 1999 ) , suggesting AP - 4 is not associated 443 with clathrin in these organisms . 444 17 In plants , the four AP - 4 subunits function together in a complex critical in trafficking 445 to the protein storage vacuole ( PSV ) . Similar to vacuolar sorting receptor ( VSR ) mutants 446 vsr1 , vsr3 , and vsr4 ( Zouhar et al . , 2010 ) , GREEN FLUORESCENT SEED ( GFS ) loss - 447 of - function AP - 4 mutants gfs4 , gfs5 , gfs6 , ap4e - 1 corresponding to AP4B , AP4M , AP4S , 448 and AP4E , respectively mislocalize the PSV - targeted 12S globulin seed storage protein 449 to the extracellular space ( Fuji et al . , 2016 ) . Binding studies have demonstrated that the 450 Arabidopsis AP4M subunit interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of VSR2 ( Gershlick et al . , 451 2014 ) . Recently , evidence for interaction between AP4 subunits with DRPs and clathrin 452 was shown via several independent approaches , including coimmunoprecipitations and 453 yeast two - hybrid experiments ( Fuji et al . , 2016 and Shimizu , et al . , 2021 ) 454 To further investigate the association of AP - 4 subunits with plant CCVs , we 455 generated a recombinant antibody against the C - terminal 22 amino acids of the AP4 - E 456 large subunit . The specificity of this antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting of total 457 protein extracts prepared from wild - type , ap4e , and complemented ap4e plants which 458 showed the presence , absence , and presence , respectively , of a band corresponding to 459 the molecular weight of AP4E ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . AP4E co - enriched with bona fide 460 CCV proteins and was approximately 90 - fold more abundant in the CCV fraction 461 compared with lysate and 3 - fold more abundant in the CCV fraction compared to the 462 DFGL ( Table 1 and Figures 4A and 4C ) . As noted in Fuji et al . , ( 2016 ) , the expression 463 levels of AP - 4 subunits in Arabidopsis are comparable to those of AP - 1 ( Park et al . , 2013 ) , 464 unlike in animals where AP - 4 expression is an order of magnitude lower ( Hirst et al . , 465 2013 ) , suggesting a more prominent role for AP - 4 in plants . 466 Previous studies have indicated AP - 4 functions at the TGN / EE ( Shimizu , et al . , 467 2021 ; Fuji , et al . 2016 ; Hirst , et al . , 1999 ) . Consistent with this , functional GFP - tagged 468 AP4M colocalizes with the TGN - resident SNARE mRFP - SYP43 and the endocytic tracer 469 FM4 - 64 in Arabidopsis root tip cells ( Fuji et al . , 2016 ) . Recently , GFP - tagged AP4M was 470 shown to localize to the TGN / EE at sites distinct from AP1M2 ( Shimizu et al . , 2021 ) . To 471 further investigate the subcellular distribution of AP - 4 and whether it colocalizes with 472 clathrin at the TGN / EE , we constructed lines that stably expressed N - terminal and C - 473 terminal GFP - and RFP - tagged AP4E fusion proteins under control of the ubiquitin - 10 474 promoter ( Grefen et al . , 2010 ) . These constructs are functional in vivo as demonstrated 475 18 by the rescue of the overall dwarf and abnormal growth phenotype observed in 476 homozygous ap4e - 1 and ap4e - 2 plants ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . Consistent with 477 visualization of GFP - tagged AP4M ( Fuji et al . , 2016 ) , ap4e - 2 lines that expressed GFP - 478 AP4E primarily displayed cytosolic and endomembrane subcellular localization with 479 signal notably absent from the plasma membrane and tonoplast ( Supplemental Figure 480 4A ) . 481 We corroborated the subcellular localization of RFP - AP4E by pulse labeling , co - 482 localization studies with the endocytic tracer dye , FM4 - 64 . This dye has been used to 483 distinguish plant endosomal compartments based on their spatial and temporal 484 distribution of the dye upon internalization , for example , by labeling the TGN / EE within 2 - 485 6 minutes of internalization ( Dettmer et al . , 2006 ; Viotti et al . , 2010 ) . We observed co - 486 localization between RFP - AP4E and FM4 - 64 ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient [ PCC ] = 487 0 . 705 utilizing a Costes’ automated threshold , Costes P = 1 . 00 ) on a similar timescale 488 ( Supplemental Figure 4B ) which confirmed that AP4E , like AP4M and AP4S , localized to 489 the TGN / EE ( Shimizu et al . , 2021 ; Fuji et al . , 2016 ) . Clathrin distribution within the cell is 490 divided into soluble ( cytosolic ) and membrane associated pools , the latter of which 491 includes the plasma membrane , TGN / EE and cell plate . Root epidermal cells expressing 492 CLC2 - GFP under control of the clc2 native promoter ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ) and 493 proUB10 : : RFP - AP4E showed occasional colocalization of these fluorophores ( PCC = 494 0 . 37 utilizing a Costes’ automated threshold , Costes P = 1 . 00 ) in endosomal structures , 495 but not at the PM nor at the cell plate ( Supplemental Figure 4D ) . Taken together with the 496 presence of AP - 4 in the CCV proteome , these data suggest AP - 4 is incorporated into 497 CCVs , likely at the TGN as part of a trafficking pathway to the PSV . 498 In contrast to AP - 1 , AP - 2 , and AP - 4 , subunits of the AP - 3 and AP - 5 complexes 499 were absent or were detected in only trace amounts in our CCV proteomes ( Supplemental 500 Dataset 4 ) . Mammalian AP - 3 is involved in trafficking between recycling and late 501 endosomes ( LE ) with mixed evidence of a clathrin association ( Hirst et al . , 1999 ) . In 502 plants , AP - 3 has been found to localize to compartments distinct from the TGN / EE , 503 recycling endosome , and Golgi ( Feraru et al . , 2010 ) . The Arabidopsis AP3B and AP3D 504 mutants , protein affected trafficking2 ( pat2 ) and pat4 , display defects in a vacuole 505 biogenesis pathway apparently independent of the canonical PVC / MVB maturation 506 19 sequence , though both mutants display overall normal growth and development , 507 suggesting AP - 3 mediates trafficking of some but not all tonoplast proteins ( Feraru et al . , 508 2010 ; Zwiewka et al . , 2011 ; Wolfenstetter et al . , 2012 ; Feng et al . , 2017 ) . Furthermore , 509 while Zwiewka et al . observed that clathrin heavy chain was identified as a potential 510 interactor of AP3 by immunoprecipitation ( IP ) of AP3B subunit and subsequent mass 511 spectrometry ( MS ) , this was not supported by IP of AP3D or in the CCV proteomic 512 datasets presented herein ( Supplemental Dataset 4 , Zwiewka et al . , 2011 ) . Very little is 513 known of the AP - 5 complex , though recent studies in mammalian cells have suggested 514 that it functions in late endosome to Golgi protein retrieval in a clathrin independent 515 fashion ( Hirst et al . , 2011 ; Hirst et al . , 2018 ) . The AP - 5 complex is essentially 516 uncharacterized in plants , though its absence in the CCV proteome ( Supplemental 517 Dataset 4 ) suggests its function ( s ) are also clathrin independent . 518 519 Clathrin Accessory Factors 520 In addition to hetero - oligomeric protein complexes , monomeric adapters , including 521 members of the ENTH / ANTH / VHS domain - containing protein family and the Golgi - 522 localized , gamma - ear - containing , ARF ( ADP - ribosylation factor ) - binding ( GGA ) family , 523 facilitate cargo recognition and vesicle formation at various points in the late 524 endomembrane system . GGA proteins , which function in CCV formation at the TGN in 525 yeast and mammals ( Bonifacino , 2004 ) , are absent from plants ( Zouhar and Sauer , 526 2014 ) . Arabidopsis contains 35 ENTH / ANTH / VHS domain - containing genes , 24 of which 527 are putatively expressed in T87 suspension - cultured cells ( Stolc et al . , 2005 ) . In addition 528 to the TPC accessory proteins AtECA4 and CAP1 ( see above ) , 13 other 529 ENTH / ANTH / VHS - domain containing proteins were identified in the suspension - cultured 530 cell CCV proteome ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) including the ENTH domain - containing 531 monomeric clathrin adaptors EPSIN1 ( EPS1 ) and EPS2 ( Collins et al . , 2020 ; Song et al . , 532 2006 ; Lee et al . , 2007 ) and the TGN - localized MODIFIED TRANSPORT TO THE 533 VACUOLE 1 ( MTV1 ) ( Sauer et al . , 2013 ; Heinze et al . , 2020 ) . 534 EPS1 and MTV1 have previously been implicated in clathrin - mediated trafficking 535 to the vacuole ( Heinze et al . , 2020 ; Sauer et al . , 2013 ; Song et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with 536 additional roles in cargo trafficking to the PM , Epsin1 modulates the plasma membrane 537 20 abundance of the immune receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 and its co - receptor , BRI1 - 538 ASSOCIATED KINASE ( BAK1 ) for effective defense responses ( Collins et al . , 2020 ) . In 539 our study , EPS1 , EPS2 , and MTV1 enriched in CCVs relative to the DFGL in labeling 540 experiments 5 - , 5 - , and 7 - fold , respectively ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) consistent with data 541 demonstrating their incorporation into CCVs ( Sauer et al . , 2013 ) , biochemical interaction 542 with clathrin and AP - 1 ( Song et al . , 2006 ) , and similar defects in the trafficking of the 543 soluble vacuolar protease precursor proaleurain in epsin1 and ap1m lines ( Song et al . , 544 2006 ; Park et al . , 2013 ) . 545 Mammalian and plant clathrin - mediated endocytosis are also regulated by Eps15 546 homology domain - containing proteins which function as membrane and / or protein 547 adaptors ( Bar , et al . , 2008 ; Chen , et al . , 1998 ; Yperman , et al . , 2021 ; Schwihla , et al . , 548 2020 ) . The Arabidopsis Eps15 homology domain - containing proteins , EHD1 and EHD2 , 549 were also found in the CCV proteome derived from both methodologies ( Supplemental 550 Dataset 4 ) . 551 Several other proteins putatively functioning as trafficking adaptors were identified 552 in the CCV proteome datasets including the sorting nexin homologs SNX1 and SNX2b 553 ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . Mammalian sorting nexins interact with subunits of the 554 endosomal retromer coat protein complex in a clathrin - independent fashion ( McGough 555 and Cullen , 2013 ) to mediate protein export from the early endosome to the TGN and PM 556 by retrieving sorting receptors ( e . g . the mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ) from the 557 lysosome ( Burd and Cullen , 2014 ) . However , an interaction between the Arabidopsis 558 retromer ( VPS26a , 26b , 29 , 35a , 35b , 35c ) and the three sorting nexin homologs ( SNX1 , 559 2a , 2b ) has yet to be shown , and conflicting evidence in the literature regarding SNX and 560 retromer localization in plant cells at the TGN and MVB ( reviewed in ( Heucken and 561 Ivanov , 2018 ; Robinson , 2018 ) ) suggest multiple , independent roles for these complexes . 562 Intriguingly , 12S globulin trafficking to the PSV is disrupted in snx mutants while that of 563 2S globulin remains apparently normal ( Pourcher et al . , 2010 ) , a phenotype also 564 observed in ap4 mutants ( Fuji et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , a YFP fusion with the Pisum 565 sativum ( pea ) homolog of Arabidopsis VSR1 ( BP80 ) colocalizes with AtSNX1 ( Jaillais et 566 al . , 2008 ) and trafficking of a similar BP80 reporter depends on SNX1 and SNX2 function 567 ( Niemes et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast to SNX1 and SNX2b , components of the retromer core 568 21 ( VPS26A , VPS26B , VPS29 , VPS35A , VPS35B , and VPS35C ) were identified in the CCV 569 proteome in low abundance ( Supplementary Table 4 ) suggesting a possible role for SNX 570 proteins in CCVs independent of retromer . Further studies are required to investigate the 571 role of SNX proteins and a possible association with CCVs as an evolutionary divergence 572 from the clathrin - independent nature of mammalian retromer / SNX function . 573 Several SH3Ps ( SH3 domain - containing proteins ) implicated in CCV trafficking 574 were present in the suspension - cultured cell CCV proteome including the TASH3 subunit 575 of the TPC , as well as SH3P1 and SH3P2 , the latter of which is in high abundance and 576 enriched in CCVs relative to DFGL fractions as measured by quantitative dimethyl 577 labeling ( 8 - fold CCV : DFGL , Supplemental Dataset 4 ) and by immunoblotting ( Nagel et 578 al . , 2017 ) . Ubiquitylation of PM proteins serves as a post - translational modification 579 signaling for internalization and vacuolar degradation ( Martins et al . , 2015 ) . SH3P2 580 localizes to PM and functions as a ubiquitin - binding protein that may facilitate ESCRT 581 recognition of ubiquitylated cargo for subsequent degradation ( Nagel et al . , 2017 ) . 582 However , SH3P2 also localizes to the cell plate and to other clathrin - positive foci 583 suggesting this and other ubiquitin adaptors may function at other membranes beyond 584 the PM . 585 Another set of clathrin accessory factors identified in the CCV proteome are 586 Arabidopsis homologs of animal SCY1 - LIKE2 proteins ( SCYL2A and SCYL2B ) ; SCYL2B 587 is in high abundance and was found to co - enrich with CCVs by quantitative dimethyl 588 labeling MS / MS experiments ( 15 - fold CCV : DFGL ratio , Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . In 589 animals , SCYL2 binds clathrin ( Duwel and Ungewickell , 2006 ) , localizes to the Golgi , 590 TGN , and other endosomes , and is incorporated into CCVs ( Conner and Schmid , 2005 ; 591 Borner et al . , 2007 ) . Although less is known about their function in plants , SCYL2B was 592 recently shown to localize to the TGN and interact with CHC as well as two related but 593 functionally distinct TGN - associated SNAREs , VTI11 and VTI12 , both of which were also 594 identified in the CCV proteome ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ; Jung et al . , 2017 ) . Taken 595 together , these data suggest SCYL2A and SCYL2B function may reflect that of 596 mammalian SCYL2 by mediating TGN CCV formation in Arabidopsis . 597 598 Dynamin Related Proteins 599 22 Following cargo recognition and clathrin recruitment , the maturing CCV must separate 600 from the plasma membrane prior to internalization . In metazoans , this is accomplished by 601 the action of the dynamin GTPases which oligomerize around the vesicle neck and utilize 602 GTP hydrolysis to exert a constricting , twisting force , achieving scission ( Antonny et al . , 603 2016 ; Cheng et al . , 2021 ) . In plants , members of the DYNAMIN RELATED PROTEIN 2 604 ( DRP2 ) protein family , DRP2A and DRP2B , which are most closely related to mammalian 605 dynamin ( Backues et al . , 2010 ; Smith et al . , 2014 ) , and the plant - specific DRP1 family 606 members DRP1A and DRP1C ( Collings et al . , 2008 ; Smith et al . , 2014 ; Ekanayake et al . , 607 2021 ; Mravec et al . , 2011 ) function together in cargo trafficking via CME ( Ekanayake et 608 al . , 2021 ) . DRP2 and DRP1 family members also biochemically interact with TPC and 609 AP - 2 ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ) and localize to PM CCPs ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Fujimoto et 610 al . , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . 611 Despite their clear association with PM CCPs ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Konopka and 612 Bednarek , 2008 ; Fujimoto et al . , 2010 ) , DRP proteins were only detected at low levels in 613 the total CCV proteome datasets ( Table 1 , Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . Consistent with this , 614 DRP1A and DRP1C show significant depletion in the CCV fraction relative to the DFGL 615 as determined via quantitative immunoblotting ( Figures 4B and 4C , Table 1 ) . This 616 apparent discrepancy may reflect a short residency of DRP proteins at the PM wherein 617 DRPs are recruited , accomplish their function ( s ) , and dissociate from the newly - formed 618 CCV . The former hypothesis is supported by high - temporal - resolution imaging data 619 showing recruitment of DRP2B , DRP1C , and DRP1A to endocytic foci at the PM 620 simultaneously with or shortly after clathrin before their simultaneous disappearance , 621 potentially reflecting a function in CCV maturation and / or scission ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ; 622 Konopka and Bednarek , 2008 ; Fujimoto et al . , 2010 ) . The brief tenure of DRPs at nascent 623 CCVs may also be reflected in the putative interaction between DRPs and the TASH3 624 subunits of the TPC ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ) , which , along with other core TPC 625 components , were likewise detected at relatively low abundance in the suspension - 626 cultured cell CCV proteome ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . This parallel may reflect a 627 functional coordination of recruitment and dissociation between DRPs and TPC in 628 endocytic CCV formation . Alternatively , we cannot rule out the low abundance of DRP 629 peptides in our dataset may be due to poor retention of the DRPs during the CCV 630 23 isolation . In contrast , the DnaJ related AUXILIN - LIKE1 and AUXILIN - LIKE2 proteins , 631 which are postulated to function in uncoating of CCVs ( Lam et al . , 2001 ; Adamowski et 632 al . , 2018 ) , were readily identified in the suspension - cell cultured CCV proteome ( Figure 633 5C ; Supplemental Dataset 4 ) , possibly due to the conditions used in vesicle preparation 634 ( pH 6 . 4 ) that block clathrin coat disassembly but which permit association of the AUXILIN - 635 LIKE proteins with CCVs ( Reynolds et al 2014 ) . Furthermore , recent data suggests that 636 uncoating of CCVs in plants may not occur immediately after scission but as the CCV is 637 trafficked away from the plasma membrane ( Narasimhan et al . , 2021 ) . 638 Our results appear consistent with those observed in mammalian and yeast 639 systems including the apparent uncertainty of dynamin association with isolated 640 mammalian CCVs with the protein being alternatively undetected ( Blondeau et al . , 2004 ) 641 or observed with high confidence ( Borner et al . , 2006 ) in different preparations . However , 642 the precise role ( s ) of members of the DRP2 and DRP1 protein families in CCV maturation 643 and / or scission remains to be determined . 644 645 Vacuolar Protein Trafficking 646 Plant Vacuolar Sorting Receptors ( VSRs ) bind soluble vacuolar proteins including 647 hydrolytic enzymes and vacuolar storage proteins ( e . g . 12S globulin and 2S albumin ) in 648 the lumen of the secretory pathway through recognition of sorting motifs of vacuolar 649 ligands , sequestering these cargo from others which are secreted or targeted towards the 650 plasma membrane ( Shimada , et al . 2003 ) . The primary mode of VSR function in plants 651 had been postulated to reflect that of the mammalian mannose 6 - phosphate receptor 652 ( MPR ) , which binds and traffics soluble lysosomal hydrolases via CCVs to the late 653 endosome . The increasingly acidic nature of the maturing endosome triggers pH - 654 dependent dissociation of its ligand , resulting in MPR recycling back to the TGN via 655 retromer - mediated trafficking ( Braulke and Bonifacino , 2009 ) , at which the pH falls within 656 the pH range for optimal MPR - ligand binding established by in vitro experiments ( Tong et 657 al . 1989 ) . However , increasing evidence indicates that VSR - mediated vacuolar protein 658 trafficking is distinct in plants ( Robinson and Neuhaus , 2016 ) . In one instance of 659 divergence from the mammalian MPR sorting model , plant VSR - ligand interaction 660 appears to be initiated in the ER and cis - Golgi rather than the TGN / EE ( daSilva et al . , 661 24 2005 ; Gershlick et al . , 2014 ; Kunzl et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , the pH of the plant TGN 662 ( 5 . 5 ) is lower than that of other compartments involved in VSR trafficking ( Luo et al . , 2015 ) 663 ostensibly marking it as the site of ligand dissociation . Thus , the newly liberated VSRs 664 must be recycled from the TGN back to the ER . In line with this hypothesis , a recent study 665 has demonstrated the retrograde movement of nano - body tagged VSR from the TGN / EE 666 to the early secretory pathway in tobacco protoplasts ( Fruholz et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , in 667 addition to the AP / CCV - mediated anterograde trafficking of VSRs , alternative proposals 668 have questioned whether VSR - laden CCVs carry soluble vacuolar cargo directly or are 669 instead part of a recycling mechanism responsible for bringing VSRs back to the early 670 secretory pathway after cargo dissociation in the TGN ( Reviewed in ( Kang and Hwang , 671 2014 ; Robinson and Neuhaus , 2016 ) . 672 Previous analyses of isolated plant CCVs have identified abundant VSR proteins 673 consistent with a role for CCVs as VSR carriers ( Masclaux et al . , 2005 ; De Marcos Lousa 674 et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , the first plant VSR to be discovered ( BP80 ) was initially detected in 675 CCVs isolated from pea ( P . sativum ) cotyledons ( Kirsch et al . , 1994 ) , and VSRs have 676 been shown to co - fractionate with clathrin and vacuolar cargos during CCV preparations 677 ( Jolliffe et al . , 2004 ) . Consistent with this , five VSR proteins were identified in the 678 suspension - cultured cell CCV proteome , of which three ( VSR1 , 3 , and 4 ) were in highest 679 abundance ( Figure 5C , Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . 680 Adaptor protein 1 and 4 complexes mediate the interaction of clathrin with VSR - 681 ligand complexes , facilitating clustering of vacuolar cargo and vesicular formation 682 necessary for vacuolar protein trafficking . The function of the AP - 1 complex as an adaptor 683 of vacuolar trafficking in plants reflects that of its mammalian / yeast counterparts in 684 lysosomal / vacuolar trafficking . Recent work in S . cerevisiae has demonstrated AP - 1 is 685 critical for retrograde recycling of cargo from mature to earlier Golgi cisternae ( Papanikou 686 et al . , 2015 ; Day et al . , 2018 ; Casler et al . , 2019 ) suggesting that retrograde trafficking of 687 VSRs and other cargo from the TGN and / or late Golgi to the early secretory pathway in 688 plants may be mediated by AP - dependent CCVs . Moreover , binding of plant VSRs to 689 AP1M is dependent on a cytoplasmic motif and is required for proper trafficking and 690 maturation of the 12S globulin precursor seed storage protein ( Gershlick et al . , 2014 ; Fuji 691 et al . , 2016 ) . Another member of the Arabidopsis VSR family , VSR4 , interacts with 692 25 AP1M2 partly through a complex cargo - recognition sequence . Mutations of this AP1M2 693 interaction motif results in VSR4 mislocalization to the PM and increased residency at the 694 tonoplast , suggesting that this motif mediates both anterograde and retrograde VSR4 695 transport ( Nishimura et al . , 2016 ) . 696 As noted above , mutants of AP - 4 subunits mislocalize PSV cargo , a phenotype 697 also observed in vsr and AP - 1 subunit mutants ( Fuji et al . , 2016 ; Zouhar et al . , 2010 ; Park 698 et al . , 2013 ) , raising questions regarding the cargo and destination specificity of AP - 1 and 699 AP - 4 dependent vacuolar trafficking . Pathway specific accessory proteins may aid in 700 differentiating AP - 1 and AP - 4 function , such as the Arabidopsis homolog of the 701 mammalian AP - 4 accessory protein tepsin , MTV1 , which has been shown to both bind 702 clathrin and co - enrich with isolated CCVs as measured by immunoblotting and electron 703 microscopy techniques ( Heinze et al . , 2020 ; Borner et al . , 2012 ; Sauer et al . , 2013 ) . We 704 have also found the AP4 interactor , MTV1 , to be highly abundant in the Arabidopsis 705 suspension - cultured cell CCV proteome and enriched in CCV pools relative to DFGL ( 7 - 706 fold enrichment , Supplementary Table 4 ) . Recent studies present a genetic interaction 707 between AP4 and MTV1 and demonstrate that MTV1 functions in vacuolar trafficking 708 ( Heinze , et al . 2020 ) , and the presence of EPS1 , AP - 1 , AP - 4 , VTI11 , and VSR1 , 3 , and 709 4 in the CCV dataset ( Figure 5C , Supplemental Dataset 4 ) considered alongside available 710 data regarding the vacuolar trafficking defects of ap1 , ap4 , and vsr mutants suggest that 711 AP - 1 and AP - 4 facilitate anterograde , and possibly retrograde , CCV - mediated trafficking 712 of VSRs to some degree . 713 714 Regulators of Clathrin - Mediated Trafficking 715 Phospholipid Metabolism 716 Intriguingly , one of the most abundant CCV proteome components identified was the 717 phosphoinositide phosphatase SAC9 , which is thought to regulate levels of 718 phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] ( Williams et al . , 2005 ; Vollmer et al . , 719 2011 ) . In mammals , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the inner leaflet of the PM mediates CCP formation 720 ( Antonescu et al . , 2011 ) through interactions with clathrin adaptor and accessory proteins 721 including subunits of the AP - 2 complex ( AP2A , AP2B , AP2M ) ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ) , 722 epsin ( Itoh et al . , 2001 ) , and dynamin ( Vallis et al . , 1999 ) . The importance of these 723 26 interactions in plant CME remains to be demonstrated , though PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulates at 724 sites of high membrane flux , like the growing pollen tube tip ( Kost et al . , 1999 ; Yao et al . , 725 1999 ) and at the apex of expanding root hairs ( Braun et al . , 1999 ) and is incorporated 726 into CCVs ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , mutants lacking the CCV - associated enzymes 727 involved in the synthesis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinases PIP5K1 728 and PIP5K , show fewer CCPs at the PM of root epidermal cells ( Ischebeck et al . , 2013 ) . 729 Studies in plants have demonstrated that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 recruits the endocytic accessory factor 730 AP2M to the plasma membrane and interacts with the EH1 subunit of the TPLATE 731 complex , suggesting that this phospholipid plays a role in the regulation of clathrin 732 mediated endocytosis ( Doumane et al . , 2021 ; Yperman et al . , 2021 ) . The presence of 733 SAC9 in the CCV proteome ( Figure 5C ; Supplemental Dataset 4 ) , taken together with the 734 numerous defects in membrane morphology including vesicle accumulation observed in 735 Arabidopsis sac9 mutants ( Vollmer et al . , 2011 ) , suggests that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 turnover in 736 mature CCVs may play an important role in the regulation of CCV trafficking . 737 738 Small GTPases 739 Rabs and ARF GTPases regulate vesicle trafficking by modulating between GTP and 740 GDP ( active and inactive ) bound states which govern interactions with downstream 741 effector proteins . Arabidopsis maintains 57 Rabs and 27 ARFs , of which the former can 742 be grouped into eight distinct clades corresponding to mammalian Rab groups mediating 743 different trafficking pathways ( Rutherford and Moore , 2002 ) . Of the numerous Rabs 744 identified in our study , members of the RabA1 , D2 , and E1 families were most abundant 745 ( Figure 5C ; Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . RabA proteins are most closely related to 746 mammalian Rab11 , which regulates endosomal trafficking and mediate TGN - PM 747 trafficking in plants ( Zhou , et al . , 2020 ; Li , et al . , 2017 ; Nielsen et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , 748 members of the RabE family , which are orthologs of the Sec4p / Rab8 GTPase family , 749 mediate exocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells ( Rutherford and Moore , 2002 ) and 750 regulate post - Golgi trafficking to the PM and to the cell plate during cytokinesis ( Orr , et 751 al . , 2021 ; Speth et al . , 2009 ; Ahn et al . , 2013 ) . RabD2 proteins are related to mammalian 752 Rab1s which participate in the early secretory pathway . In plants however , RabD2 753 27 proteins localize to the Golgi / TGN ( Pinheiro et al . , 2009 ) and mediate post - Golgi 754 trafficking at certain endosomes ( Drakakaki et al . , 2012 ) . 755 Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) are tasked with activating GTPases 756 by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP . Evidence has shown STOMATAL 757 CYTOKINESIS DEFECTIVE1 ( SCD1 ) and SCD2 proteins participate in a complex that 758 interacts with RabE1s in a nucleotide - dependent matter as well as subunits of the exocyst 759 ( Mayers et al . , 2017 ) , suggesting the SCD complex may function as a RabGEF in 760 exocytosis . Both SCD1 and SCD2 enrich with the purification of CCVs by immunoblot 761 analysis ( McMichael et al . , 2013 ) and were detected , albeit at low levels , in both unlabeled 762 CCV proteomic datasets ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . Despite the presence of SCD1 and 763 SCD2 in enriched CCVs and impaired internalization and post - Golgi trafficking defects of 764 scd mutants , it is not clear whether the SCD complex directly functions in endocytosis or 765 functions in recycling endocytic machinery to the plasma membrane . 766 The Arabidopsis suspension - cultured cell CCV proteome contains several 767 additional structural and regulatory components of the exocyst tethering complex 768 including SEC6 , SEC15b , SEC10 , EXO84B , and EXO70A1 ( Figure 5C ; Supplemental 769 Dataset 4 ) . Mammalian SEC15 , SEC10 , and EXO84 interact with vesicle - bound small 770 GTPases to facilitate secretory trafficking from the TGN while EXO70 localizes to target 771 membranes ( Wu and Guo , 2015 ) . Exocyst function in Arabidopsis appears to be 772 conserved , including putative subcellular localizations at sites with high rates of vesicle 773 fusion , e . g . EXO70A1 and EXO84b at the CP ( Fendrych et al . , 2010 ) . 774 In addition to GEFs , which initiate GTPase activation , GTPase activating proteins 775 ( GAPs ) promoting Rab GTP hydrolysis to terminate GTPase signaling are likewise critical 776 for controlling vesicle trafficking . The ARF - GAP NEVERSHED / AGD5 / MTV4 which is 777 required for vacuolar protein trafficking ( Sauer et al . , 2013 ) , was previously demonstrated 778 to co - enrich with CCVs using immunoblotting and immunoEM techniques . In agreement , 779 this ARF - GAP is well represented in the CCV proteome ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . 780 781 SNAREs 782 In this study , we identified PM - and endosome - localized SNAREs in the CCV proteome 783 ( Eisenach et al . , 2012 ; Ichikawa et al . , 2014 ; Suwastika et al . , 2008 ; Bassham et al . , 2000 ; 784 28 Ebine et al . , 2011 ; da Silva Conceicao et al . , 1997 ; Uemura et al . , 2012 ) . SNAREs 785 localized to the PM , such as SYP121 , VAMP722 , SYP132 , and SYP71 , were enriched 7 - 786 , 5 - , 8 - , and 6 - fold , respectively , in the CCV fraction . Endosomal SNAREs , SYP61 , 787 SYP41 , VTI12 , VAMP727 , SYP21 , and SYP43 , were enriched 6 - , 13 - , 7 - , 5 - , 2 - , and 9 - 788 fold , respectively ( Figure 5C ; Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . The cell plate / cytokinesis - specific 789 syntaxin and putative CCV cargo KNOLLE ( KN ) ( Lauber et al . , 1997 ; Boutte et al . , 2010 ) 790 was notably enriched in CCVs in dimethylabeling ( 6 - fold ) and modestly enriched in 791 quantitative immunoblotting ( 1 . 3 - fold ) experiments ( Figure 4 , Table 1 , Supplementary 792 Table 4 ) . In contrast , SNAREs localized to compartments likely not engaged in CCV 793 trafficking , such as the tonoplast protein VAMP713 ( Takemoto et al . , 2018 ) and the Golgi - 794 localized VAMP714 ( Uemura et al . , 2005 ) , were depleted in CCVs 5 - and 3 - fold relative 795 to the DFGL , respectively ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . 796 We also identified several homologs of mammalian trafficking regulators involved 797 in vesicle fusion in the CCV proteome , including PROTON ATPASE TRANSLOCATION 798 CONTROL 1 ( PATROL1 ) which contains the Munc13 MUN domain ( Figure 4C ; 799 Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . While the mammalian Munc13 interacts with the SNARE 800 syntaxin - 1 to prime synaptic vesicles for fusion with the PM ( Ma et al . , 2011 ) , less is 801 known of MUN - domain containing protein function in plants . PATROL1 appears to 802 modulate the delivery of the PM H + - ATPase AHA1 to the PM possibly through 803 interactions with the exocyst complex and localizes to endosomes and dynamic foci at 804 the cell cortex ( Hashimoto - Sugimoto et al . , 2013 ; Higaki et al . , 2014 ; Zhu et al . , 2018 ) . 805 The presence of both PATROL1 and AHA1 in the CCV proteome ( Figure 5C ; 806 Supplemental Dataset 4 ) suggests PATROL may regulate the trafficking of CCVs 807 containing AHA1 through interactions with its MUN domain . Another SNARE interacting 808 protein , VPS45 , was detected in abundance in the CCV proteome and found to enrich in 809 CCVs in differential labeling experiments ( 5 - fold CCV : DFGL enrichment , Supplemental 810 Dataset 4 ) . VPS45 is a Munc18 protein that binds and regulates the TGN SNARE 811 complex comprised of SYP41 , SYP61 , YKT61 , and VTI12 , potentially to mediate fusion 812 of PVC - derived vesicles at the TGN ( Bassham et al . , 2000 ; Zouhar et al . , 2009 ) . Given 813 the presence of VPS45 and its cognate SNAREs ( SYP41 , SYP61 , VTI12 , YKT61 ) in the 814 CCV proteome ( Figure 5C ; Supplemental Dataset 4 ) , clathrin - mediated trafficking may 815 29 play a role in the regulation / function of the complex , possibly by recycling individual 816 SNAREs for subsequent fusion events . 817 818 Conclusion 819 Space constraints prohibit a full discussion of all protein groups identified in the 820 suspension - cultured cell CCV proteome ; instead , we have reported on a subset of 821 actively discussed protein groups and provided the complete CCV proteome as a rich 822 data reference and resource for future investigations of proteins putatively involved in 823 clathrin - mediated trafficking . An important caveat to interpreting the biological 824 significance of the suspension cultured CCV proteome is that CCV composition reflects 825 the tissue / cell type and developmental stage of the biological source material from which 826 they are isolated . The data reported here reflects the content of CCVs isolated from 827 undifferentiated , rapidly dividing and expanding Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells 828 under conditions amenable to tissue culture . Future experiments probing CCV content in 829 other cell and tissue types under varying conditions or in different genetic backgrounds 830 might apply our isolation methodology ( Reynolds et al . , 2014 ) using seedlings as a 831 sample source as recently described ( Nagel et al . , 2017 ; Mosesso et al . , 2019 ) . 832 Our proteomic data demonstrate that , in addition to the canonical clathrin coat 833 adapters AP - 1 and AP - 2 , the AP - 4 complex is incorporated into plant CCVs in an 834 apparent contrast to its function in metazoans ( Mattera et al . , 2015 ; Robinson , 2015 ) . This 835 result inspires numerous questions regarding the evolutionary divergence of plant 836 trafficking proteins relative to other eukaryotes , as well as the identity of which pathway ( s ) 837 might be mediated by AP - 4 and clathrin . Current biochemical and genetic studies in the 838 literature suggest AP - 4 mediates the trafficking of specific cargos to the PSV ( Gershlick 839 et al . , 2014 ; Fuji et al . , 2016 ) , though whether AP - 4 function in CCVs directly facilitates 840 the anterograde trafficking of soluble cargos and their cognate receptors ( i . e . VSRs ) or 841 instead participates in the recycling thereof remains to be determined . Additional studies 842 identifying the composition of AP - 2 , AP - 1 , and AP - 4 - positive CCVs are needed to better 843 understand cargo specificity and identify the regulators governing formation , trafficking , 844 and fusion of these vesicles . Nevertheless , the identification of AP - 4 as a CCV - associated 845 protein complex presented here , together with recent genetic and biochemical evidence , 846 30 will contribute to future experiments focused on elucidating the mechanisms of AP - 4 - 847 dependent post - Golgi trafficking to the PSV . The question remains : is the interaction 848 between AP - 4 and clathrin direct as is the case for AP - 1 and AP - 2 ? 849 Coimmunoprecipitation experiments ( Fuji et al . , 2016 ; Shimizu , et al . , 2021 ) and AP - 4 850 abundance in the CCV proteome suggest that it might be , but a conclusive demonstration 851 of a direct biochemical interaction remains to be determined . Determining the role of 852 clathrin in VSR sorting , given the recent evidence of an ER / cis - Golgi to TGN / EE VSR - 853 dependent , vacuolar trafficking pathway will be essential as plant endomembrane 854 dynamics become better understood ( Robinson and Pimpl , 2014 ; Robinson and Neuhaus 855 2016 ) . 856 In contrast to the evolutionarily conserved endocytic adaptor AP - 2 , subunits of the 857 TPLATE complex , which is essential for CME , were not significantly enriched in the final 858 enrichment step towards purified CCVs suggesting that the TPLATE complex may 859 dissociate more readily from CCVs following their budding from the plasma membrane 860 relative to AP - 2 . This observation may be resolved by a recent study in which TPLATE 861 dissociated from CCVs earlier than clathrin and which positioned the TPLATE complex 862 on the periphery of a clathrin coated structure at the plasma membrane ( Johnson et al . 863 bioRxiv 2021 ) . The positioning of the TPLATE complex to the periphery of the budding 864 vesicle will be of significant biological interest . 865 As discussed above , the enriched CCV proteomic datasets contain numerous 866 proteins that are unlikely to be associated with CCVs ( e . g . ribosomal subunits ) . The 867 presence of a protein in a shotgun MS / MS dataset , especially those of low abundance , 868 must be taken as a preliminary indication only of its presence and therefore requires 869 subsequent confirmation . Conversely , the absence or low abundance of proteins of 870 interest might also be explained by low intracellular concentrations , such as in the case 871 of regulatory proteins like the SCD1 and SCD2 subunits of the SCD complex which , while 872 in low abundance in the MS / MS dataset , are shown to coenrich with isolated CCVs via 873 immunoblotting and other techniques . Nevertheless , our CCV proteomics data expand 874 our understanding of the plant endomembrane compartments for subsequent efforts to 875 investigate the plant endomembrane network and their physiological function in the future . 876 31 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 877 The authors would like to acknowledge the VIB Proteomics Core Facility ( VIB - UGent 878 Center for Medical Biotechnology in Ghent , Belgium ) and the Research Technology 879 Support Facility Proteomics Core ( Michigan State University in East Lansing , Michigan ) 880 for sample analysis , as well as the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center Mass 881 Spectrometry Core Facility ( Madison , WI ) for help with data processing .

Seed stocks of the ap4e - 1 and ap4e - 2 T - DNA 906 insertion mutants ( Fuji et al . , 2016 ) were graciously provided by Tomoo Shimada of Kyoto 907 University . CLC2 - GFP transgenic plant lines were generated as previously described 908 32 ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ) . Seeds were sterilized in 70 % ( v / v ) ethanol with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton 909 X - 10 for 5 minutes and in 90 % ( v / v ) ethanol for 1 minute prior to plating on ½ strength MS 910 media ( Murashige and Skoog , 1962 ) containing 0 . 6 % ( w / v ) agar . Seeds were stratified 911 without light at 4°C for 3 days prior to growing under continuous light at 22°C . Plants 912 grown on soil were transferred from plates after 7 to 14 days to Metro - Mix 360 ( SunGro 913 Horticulture ) and grown at 22°C long days ( 16 hours of light exposure ) . ap4e - 1 and ap4e - 914 2 mutants were genotyped using primers GR1 , 2 , & 5 and GR3 , 4 , & 5 , respectively . 915 Undifferentiated Arabidopsis T87 cells ( Axelos et al . , 1992 ) were maintained in MS 916 media supplemented with 0 . 2 mg / L 2 , 4 - Dichloropphenoxyacetic acid and 1 . 32 mM 917 KH 2 PO 4 under continuous light at 22°C on an orbital shaker at 140 RPM . Cells were 918 passaged weekly at 1 : 10 dilution . 919 920 Primers 921 GR1 – SAIL866C01 _ LP – 5’ - CATGGGTATTGATGGTCTTGG - 3’ 922 GR2 – SAIL866C01 _ RP – AGACCAGAACAGCTAAGCACG 923 GR3 – SAIL60E03 _ LP – ATAGGCTTCGAATCGAAGAGC 924 GR4 – SAIL60E03 _ RP – ATGCAGGTGGAATCGTACTTG 925 GR5 – SAIL _ LB3 – TAGCATCTGAATTTCATAACCAATCTCGATA 926 GR6 – SB1859STOPsense – CAAAGATCTCCTCGGCTGAGCACCTCTCTTCTTCA 927 GR7 – SB1859STOPanti - TGAAGAAGAGAGGTGCTCAGCCGAGGAGATCTTTG 928 GR8 – SB1859del673sense - CAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGCAAGAAGGTCCATGGA 929 GR9 – SB1859del673anti – CTCCATGGACCTTCTTGCGAAGCCTGCTTTTTTG 930 931 932 Plasmid Construction and Plant Transformation 933 All oligonucleotide primers used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA 934 Technologies . Transgenic plants were generated using the floral dip method ( Clough and 935 Bent , 1998 ) with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 . N - terminal and C - 936 terminal GFP and RFP fusions with AP4E under control of the UBQ10 promoter were 937 created in pUBN - Dest and pUBC - Dest vectors ( Grefen et al . , 2010 ) using Gateway™ 938 cloning ( Invitrogen ) . The AP4E CDS in pLIC6 , obtained from ABRC clone 939 DKLAT1G31730 , was moved into pDONR221 ( Invitrogen ) using the BP Clonase kit . Stop 940 33 codon insertion and frame correction for pUBN constructs was accomplished with primer 941 pairs GR6 & 7 and GR8 & 9 , respectively , before using the LR Clonase kit ( Invitrogen ) to 942 move respective AP4E constructs into pUBN and pUBC destination vectors . 943 T1 seedlings from pUBN / pUBC transformed plants were sown on soil and selected 944 by spray application of a 120 µg / ml Glufosinate ( Liberty Herbicide , Bayer Crop Sciences ) 945 water solution containing 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Silwet - 77 sufactant 7 , 9 , 12 , and 14 days after 946 germination . 947 948 CCV Enrichment and Analysis 949 CCVs were isolated from undifferentiated Arabidopsis T87 cells as described ( Reynolds 950 et al . , 2014 ) . Total protein yield in the enriched CCV fraction was approximately 300 - 500 951 μg per biological replicate . Protein concentrations of individual fractions for subsequent 952 immunoblotting analysis and total CCV yield were obtained using the Pierce® 660nm 953 Protein Assay ( Thermo Scientific ) . 954 Immunoblotting was performed as described ( McMichael et al . , 2013 ) Information 955 about generation of antibodies and concentrations used is described in Supplemental 956 Table 1 . 957 958 Anti - AP4E Antibody Generation 959 The c - terminal 22 amino acids of the Arabidopsis AP4 Epsilon subunit were cloned from 960 the ABRC stock DKLAT1G31730 into the pAN4GST GST - expression vector and the 961 resulting construct used for phage display as described ( Blanc et al . , 2014 ) by the Geneva 962 Antibody Facility at the Université de Genève , Switzerland . Antibody specificity was 963 tested by probing the total protein content of wild - type , ap4e - 1 , ap4e - 2 , and various 964 transgenic plants expressing GRP and RFP fusions with AP4E ( Fig . S2 ) . Seedlings grown 965 on plates as described for 7 - 14 days were flash frozen and homogenized via mortar and 966 pestle under liquid nitrogen . Tissue was resuspended in 2X lamelli buffer , quantified using 967 the Pierce® 660nm Protein Assay ( Thermo Scientific ) , and diluted accordingly such that 968 23 . 5 µg of each sample in equal volumes could be loaded on an 11 % Tris - HCl SDS - 969 PAGE gel and analyzed via western blotting . 970 971 34 Light Microscopy 972 All confocal imaging experiments were conducted on a Nikon A1R - Si + microscope . 973 Colocalization and localization observations were made in root tip epidermal cells of 5 to 974 7 - day old seedlings grown on plates as described above . Seedlings were mounted for 975 imaging in ½ MS media . FM4 - 64 treated samples were incubated in ½ MS containing 976 4µM FM4 - 64 for three minutes and mounted in the same solution before imaging after 6 977 minutes total incubation . 978 Colocalization analysis was performed using the JACoP plugin ( Bolte and 979 Cordelieres , 2006 ) in the Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) distribution of ImageJ2 ( Rueden et 980 al . , 2017 ) . Images were processed to remove background ( Rolling ball 50 - pixel diameter ) 981 and cropped to relevant ROIs before analysis with JACoP utilizing 1000 Costes 982 randomizations with a point spread function of two pixels and Costes’ automated 983 thresholding . 984 985 STEM Imaging of Purified CCVs 986 4 µl of purified CCV preparation ( 0 . 33 mg / µl ) were applied to carbon - coated and 987 glow discharged ( 2 minutes at 7x10 - 1 mbar ) 300 - mesh copper EM grids ( Electron 988 Microscopy Sciences ; CF300 - CU ) and incubated for four minutes at room temperature . 989 Excess solution was removed with blotting paper and samples immediately fixed by a 20 990 minute incubation with 2 % glutaraldehyde ( v / v ) in PEM buffer ( 100 mM PIPES , 1 mM 991 MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , pH 6 . 9 ) . Samples were then washed with phosphate buffer ( 0 . 1 M , 992 pH 7 . 4 ) and distilled water , followed by a 20 minute incubation with 0 . 1 % tannic acid ( w / v ) 993 in MilliQ water . After three washes in water , the samples were incubated with 0 . 2 % 994 aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 minutes at room temperature and then washed three times 995 with water before being dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol ( 10 % , 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , 996 80 % , 96 % and 100 % for 2 minutes each ) and two washes with hexamethyldisilane ( 99 % ) . 997 Dried samples were then coated with 3 nm platinum and 4 nm carbon using an ACE600 998 coating device ( Leica Microsystems ) . The sample grids were imaged using a JEOL 999 JEM2800 scanning / transmission electron microscope at 200 kV . 1000 1001 LC / MS / MS of CCVs separated by 1D SDS - PAGE 1002 35 Enriched CCV fractions were resolved via 1D SDS - PAGE on a 4 - 15 % Tris - HCl gradient 1003 gel ( BioRad cat # 161 - 1158 ) at a constant 200V for ~ 90 minutes . Gels were stained with 1004 Coomassie R250 and cut into ~ 10 bands . Gel bands were digested in - gel as described 1005 ( Shevchenko et al . , 1996 ) with modifications . Briefly , gel bands were dehydrated using 1006 100 % acetonitrile and incubated with 10mM dithiothreitol in 100mM ammonium 1007 bicarbonate , pH ~ 8 , at 56 ℃ for 45min , dehydrated again and incubated in the dark with 1008 50mM iodoacetamide in 100mM ammonium bicarbonate for 20 minutes . Gel bands were 1009 then washed with ammonium bicarbonate and dehydrated again . Sequencing grade 1010 modified trypsin was prepared to 0 . 01ug / µL in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate and ~ 50uL 1011 of this was added to each gel band so that the gel was completely submerged . Bands 1012 were then incubated at 37°C overnight . Peptides were extracted from the gel by water 1013 bath sonication in a solution of 60 % ACN / 1 % TCA and vacuum dried to ~ 2uL . 1014 Enriched DFGL or CCV fractions for dimethyl labeling experiments were prepared 1015 in the same manner as the other CCV samples up to peptide extraction and vacuum 1016 drying except that a 12 . 5 % Tris - HCl SDS polyacrylamide gel was used . Each peptide 1017 sample was then re - suspended in 100mM Triethylammonium and labeled in solution with 1018 dimethyl reagents ( light label – C2H6 , medium label – C2H2D4 ) according to ( Boersema 1019 et al . 2009 ) . After labeling , peptides were purified using solid phase extraction tips ( OMIX , 1020 www . varian . com ) . Same slice samples from each condition were combined and dried to 1021 ~ 2uL . Peptides were then re - suspended in 2 % acetonitrile / 0 . 1 % TFA to 25uL . From this , 1022 10uL were automatically injected by a Waters nanoAcquity Sample Manager 1023 ( www . waters . com ) and loaded for 5 minutes onto a Waters Symmetry C18 peptide trap 1024 ( 5um , 180um x 20mm ) at 4uL / min in 5 % ACN / 0 . 1 % Formic Acid . The bound peptides were 1025 then eluted onto a MICHROM Bioresources ( www . michrom . com ) 0 . 1 x 150mm column 1026 packed with 3u , 200A Magic C18AQ material over 90min with a gradient of 5 % B to 35 % 1027 B in 77min , ramping to 90 % B at 79min , holding for 1min and returning to 5 % B at 80 . 1min 1028 for the remainder of the analysis using a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC ( Buffer A = 99 . 9 % 1029 Water / 0 . 1 % Formic Acid , Buffer B = 99 . 9 % Acetonitrile / 0 . 1 % Formic Acid ) with an initial 1030 flow rate of 1uL / min . 1031 Peptides were then re - suspended in 2 % acetonitrile / 0 . 1 % TFA to 20uL . From this , 1032 10uL were automatically injected by a Thermo ( www . thermo . com ) EASYnLC onto a 1033 36 Thermo Acclaim PepMap RSLC 0 . 075mm x 150mm C18 column and eluted at 250nL 1034 over 90min with a gradient of 5 % B to 30 % B in 79min , ramping to 100 % B at 80min and 1035 held at 100 % B for the duration of the run ( Buffer A = 99 . 9 % Water / 0 . 1 % Formic Acid , 1036 Buffer B = 99 . 9 % Acetonitrile / 0 . 1 % Formic Acid ) . Eluted peptides were analyzed as 1037 follows : CCV I : peptides were sprayed into a ThermoFisher LTQ - FT Ultra mass 1038 spectrometer using a Michrom ADVANCE nanospray source with survey scans were 1039 taken in the FT ( 25000 resolution determined at m / z 400 ) and the top five ions in each 1040 survey scan then subjected to automatic low energy collision induced dissociation ( CID ) 1041 in the LTQ ; CCV II , Dimethyl Labeling Samples : peptides were sprayed into a 1042 ThermoFisher LTQ Linear Ion trap mass spectrometer using a Michrom ADVANCE 1043 nanospray source with the top eight ions in each survey scan are then subjected to low 1044 energy CID in a data dependent manner ; CCV III & CCV IV : peptides were sprayed into 1045 a ThermoFisher Q - Exactive mass spectrometer using a FlexSpray spray ion source with 1046 survey scans were taken in the Orbi trap ( 70 , 000 resolution , determined at m / z 200 ) and 1047 the top twelve ions in each survey scan are then subjected to automatic higher energy 1048 collision induced dissociation ( HCD at 25 % ) with fragment spectra acquired at 17 , 500 1049 resolution . The resulting MS / MS spectra from CCV replicates were converted to peak lists 1050 using Mascot Distiller , v2 . 4 . 3 . 3 ( www . matrixscience . com ) and searched against a custom 1051 database which included all entries in the TAIR10 protein sequence database 1052 ( downloaded from www . arabidopsis . org ) , appended with common laboratory 1053 contaminants ( downloaded from www . thegpm . org , cRAP project ) , using the Mascot 1054 searching algorithm , v2 . 4 , with the following parameters : 2 allowed missed tryptic 1055 cleavages , fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine , variable modification of 1056 oxidation of methionine , peptide tolerance ±5ppm , MS / MS tolerance 0 . 3 Da . False 1057 Discovery Rates ( FDR ) were calculated against a randomized database search . The 1058 Mascot output was then analyzed using Scaffold , v4 . 8 . 4 ( Proteome Software Inc . , 1059 Portland , OR ) to probabilistically validate protein identifications . Assignments validated 1060 using the Scaffold 1 % FDR protein threshold , containing 2 unique peptides , and meeting 1061 the 95 % confidence peptide threshold were considered true . Assignments matching these 1062 criteria from four distinct biological replicates ( CCV enrichments ) were cross - referenced 1063 37 to eliminate duplicates and filtered to exclude proteins not present in at least two biological 1064 replicates , generating a list of 3 , 548 protein assignments . 1065 Quantitation of labeled MS peaks from dimethyl labeling samples and processing 1066 of the resulting MS / MS spectra to peak lists was done using MaxQuant3 , v1 . 2 . 2 . 5 ( Cox 1067 and Mann , 2008 ) . Peak lists were searched against the TAIR10 protein sequence 1068 database , downloaded from www . arabidopsis . org and appended with common laboratory 1069 contaminants using the Andromeda search algorithm within MaxQuant with the following 1070 parameters : two allowed missed tryptic cleavages , fixed modification of carbamidomethyl 1071 cysteine , variable modification of oxidation of methionine and acetylation of protein N - 1072 termini , DimethLys0 , DimethNter0 ; DimethLys4 , DimethNter4 , peptide tolerance ±6ppm , 1073 MS / MS tolerance 20ppm , protein and peptide FDR filter set to 1 % . A total of 1 , 109 unique 1074 proteins were identified between both replicates , 948 of which were identified in the 1075 LC / MS - MS dataset corresponding to CCVs digested in gel across two or more biological 1076 replicates . 1077 Overlaps between proteomic datasets were identified by matching accession 1078 numbers between the 3 , 548 accession numbers in column 1 of Supplemental Dataset 1 , 1079 the accession numbers of the 1 , 109 proteins identified in at least one of two dimethyl 1080 replicates ( Supplemental Dataset 3 ) , and the first accession number ( corresponding to 1081 iBAQ values listed ) of the majority accession numbers within each protein group ( n = 1082 1 , 981 ) in the alternative methodology CCV LC / MS - MS dataset ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . 1083 Overlaps between proteomic datasets were visualized using the application , BioVenn 1084 ( Hulsen et al . , 2008 ) . 1085 Protein localization of the 536 more than two - fold depleted proteins between the 1086 DFGL and CCV purification steps ( Supplemental Dataset 3 ) were determined by 1087 submission of the corresponding accession numbers ( Supplemental Dataset 5 ) to the 1088 SUBcellular Arabidopsis ( SUBA ) consensus algorithm ( Hooper et al . , 2014 ) . 1089 1090 LC / MS - MS of CCVs digested in solution 1091 5µg of 1 µg / µl isolated CCVs were lysed in a urea lysis buffer containing 8 M urea , 20 1092 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , by repeatedly pipetting up and down . Proteins in each sample were 1093 reduced by adding 15 mM DTT and incubation for 30 minutes at 55˚C . Alkylation of the 1094 38 proteins was done by addition of 30 mM iodoacetamide for 15 minutes at room 1095 temperature in the dark . The samples were diluted with 20 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 to a urea 1096 concentration of 2 M and the proteins were digested with 4 µl Trypsin / LysC ( Promega 1097 V5073 : 20ug + 80uL 50mM acetic acid ) for 4 hours at 37˚C and boosted with an extra 2µl 1098 Trypsin / LysC ( Promega V5073 : 20ug + 80uL 50mM acetic acid ) overnight at 37˚C . 1099 Peptides were then purified on a OMIX C18 pipette tip ( Agilent ) . 1100 Purified peptides were re - dissolved in 25 µl loading solvent A ( 0 . 1 % TFA in 1101 water / ACN ( 98 : 2 , v / v ) ) and 5 µl was injected for LC - MS / MS analysis on an Ultimate 3000 1102 RSLCnano ProFLow system in - line connected to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer 1103 ( Thermo ) . Trapping was performed at 10 μl / min for 4 min in loading solvent A on a 20 mm 1104 trapping column ( made in - house , 100 μm internal diameter ( I . D . ) , 5 μm beads , C18 1105 Reprosil - HD , Dr . Maisch , Germany ) and the sample was loaded on a 200 mm analytical 1106 column ( made in - house , 75 µm I . D . , 1 . 9 µm beads C18 Reprosil - HD , Dr . Maisch ) . 1107 Peptides were eluted by a non - linear gradient from 2 to 55 % MS solvent B ( 0 . 1 % FA in 1108 water / acetonitrile ( 2 : 8 , v / v ) ) over 175 minutes at a constant flow rate of 250 nl / min , 1109 reaching 99 % MS solvent B after 200 minutes , followed by a 10 minute wash with 99 % 1110 MS solvent B and re - equilibration with MS solvent A ( 0 . 1 % FA in water ) . The column 1111 temperature was kept constant at 50°C in a column oven ( Butterfly , Phoenix S & T ) . The 1112 mass spectrometer was operated in data - dependent mode , automatically switching 1113 between MS and MS / MS acquisition for the 16 most abundant ion peaks per MS 1114 spectrum . Full - scan MS spectra ( 375 - 1500 m / z ) were acquired at a resolution of 60 , 000 1115 in the orbitrap analyzer after accumulation to a target value of 3E6 . The 16 most intense 1116 ions above a threshold value of 1 . 3E4 were isolated for fragmentation at a normalized 1117 collision energy of 28 % after filling the trap at a target value of 1E5 for maximum 80 ms . 1118 MS / MS spectra ( 200 - 2000 m / z ) were acquired at a resolution of 15 , 000 in the orbitrap 1119 analyzer . 1120 Data analysis was performed with MaxQuant ( version 1 . 6 . 10 . 43 ) using the built in 1121 Andromeda search engine with default settings , including a false discovery rate set at 1 % 1122 on both the peptide and protein level . Spectra were searched against the Araport11plus 1123 database , consisting of the Araport11 _ genes . 2016 . 06 . pep . fasta downloaded from 1124 www . arabidopsis . org , extended with sequences of all types of possible contaminants in 1125 39 proteomics experiments in general . These contaminants include the cRAP protein 1126 sequences , a list of proteins commonly found in proteomics experiments , which are 1127 present either by accident or by unavoidable contamination of protein samples ( The 1128 Global Proteome Machine , http : / / www . thegpm . org / crap / ) . In addition , commonly used tag 1129 sequences and typical contaminants , such as sequences from frequently used resins and 1130 proteases , were added . The Araport11plus database contains in total 49 , 057 sequence 1131 entries . The mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions was set to 4 . 5 and 20 ppm , 1132 respectively , including matching between runs and false discovery rate set at 1 % on PSM , 1133 peptide and protein level . Enzyme specificity was set as C - terminal to arginine and lysine 1134 ( trypsin ) , also allowing cleavage at arginine / lysine - proline bonds with a maximum of two 1135 missed cleavages . Variable modifications were set to oxidation of methionine residues 1136 and acetylation of protein N - termini . Proteins were quantified by the MaxLFQ algorithm 1137 integrated in the MaxQuant software . Only protein groups with at least one unique peptide 1138 and with peptides identified in at least two of three biological replicates were retained , 1139 yielding a list of 1 , 981 protein groups ( Supplemental Dataset 4 ) . 1140 1141 Plant Accession # s 1142 Accession numbers corresponding to proteins identified in this study can be found in 1143 Supplemental Datasets 1 - 3 . 1144 1145 Proteomic Data Deposition 1146 Files corresponding to raw proteomics data , as well as results , search , and peak list files 1147 can be accessed on the MassIVE data repository ( MassIVE , University of California at 1148 San Diego ) using the identifiers , PXD026180 or at doi : 10 . 25345 / C50F9D , or at the 1149 following URL : ftp : / / massive . ucsd . edu / MSV000087472 / .

Sizes of and overlaps in proteomic datasets defining proteins associated with clathrin - coated vesicles purified from Arabidopsis cells . Four independent CCV preparations were separated by one - dimensional SDS - PAGE before LC / MS - MS . Proteins or proteins representative of protein groups were incorporated into the unla - beled LC / MS - MS dataset ( blue ) if total spectral counts for the protein / protein group were present in > / = 2 replicates ( 3 , 548 proteins ) . Three independent CCV preparations were not separated by SDS - PAGE but treated with urea before trypsin digest and subsequent LC / MS - MS . Protein groups were incorporated into in - solution digest , unlabeled LC / MS - MS dataset ( orange ) if they were identi - fied in at least two replicates ( 1 , 981 protein groups ) ; overlap with this dataset was determined using the first protein within the protein groups identified . Deuterium ficoll gradient load ( DFGL ) and CCV fractions from two independent preparations were reciprocally labeled with light and heavy formalde - hyde before separation with SDS - PAGE and subjection to LC / MS - MS . Proteins identified in at least one replicate as increased or decreased in abundance between CCV and DFGL fractions were included in the dimethyl labeling LC / MS - MS dataset ( 1 , 109 proteins ; green ) . The sizes of circles and overlaps are proportional to the number of proteins or protein groups contained within .
