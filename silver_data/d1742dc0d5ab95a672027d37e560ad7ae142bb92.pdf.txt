Giant Kovacs - Like Memory Eﬀect for Active Particles Rüdiger Kürsten , 1 Vladimir Sushkov , 2 and Thomas Ihle 1 1 Institut für Physik , Universität Greifswald , Felix - Hausdorﬀ - Str . 6 , 17489 Greifswald 2 Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften München , Fakultät für angewandte Naturwissenschaften und Mechatronik , Lothstr . 34 , 80335 München ( Dated : May 15 , 2017 ) Dynamical properties of a Vicsek - like gas of self - propelled particles are investigated by means of kinetic theory and agent based simulations . While memory eﬀects have been observed in disordered systems , we show that they also occur in active matter systems . In particular , we ﬁnd that the system exhibits a giant Kovacs - like memory eﬀect that is much larger than predicted by a generic linear theory . Based on a separation of time scales we develop a nonlinear theory to explain this eﬀect . We apply this theory to driven granular gases and propose further applications to spin glasses . Collective behavior is a crucial aspect in the rapidly growing ﬁeld of active matter [ 1 – 4 ] . Active particles un - der consideration can be animals like e . g . insects , ﬁsh or birds [ 5 ] , interacting robots [ 6 ] , or microscopic objects like e . g . bacteria [ 7 ] , nano - dimers [ 8 ] or Janus particles [ 9 ] . There is shared belief , that , on a macroscopic level , active particle systems can be described by a minimal set of hydrodynamic ﬁelds [ 10 ] . There has been large emphasis in deriving ﬁeld equations using diﬀerent ap - proaches [ 10 – 24 ] . For polar particles with ferromagnetic alignment interactions the description by Toner and Tu’s seminal equations [ 25 , 26 ] is well established . Steady states of homogeneous solutions have also been studied in detail [ 27 – 29 ] . However , memory eﬀects and dynam - ical properties of active matter far from its steady state are largely unexplored . To study non - stationary properties and possible history - dependencies we consider the following prototype situation : Imagine a substance that , at time t = 0 , is in equilibrium with a heat bath of temperature T 1 , and as - sume that the temperature of the heat bath could be changed instantaneously . Suppose , we want to heat the substance to a higher temperature T f > T 1 . This could be achieved by simply adjusting the heat bath to the de - sired ﬁnal temperature T f . After a certain time , the sub - stance will have relaxed to equilibrium at T f . Trying to speed up this process one could initially set the heat bath to a higher temperature T 2 > T f and switch the temper - ature of the heat bath to T f after a particular waiting time t w . Because the amount of heat transfered to the system until time t = t w is increased by this protocol , we intuitively expect the system to reach the desired tem - perature faster . This procedure is related to a measuring protocol introduced by Kovacs et . al [ 30 , 31 ] . In addi - tion to the aforementioned steps they chose the waiting time t w in a particular way . Considering an observable Ψ , the waiting time was chosen such that at the moment of temperature switching t w , the observable Ψ has the same value that it has in equilibrium at temperature T f . Thus Ψ ( t w ) = Ψ ( t → ∞ ) . In the case of [ 30 , 31 ] , Ψ is the volume and here it is the polar order parameter . If the order parameter Ψ ( t ) enslaved all other degrees of freedom as implicitly assumed in Toner - Tu theories [ 13 , 25 , 26 , 32 – 34 ] , the system would be in equilibrium already at t = t w and remain unchanged for the rest of the experiment . If , however , at t = t w there are addi - tional hidden degrees of freedom that are not perfectly enslaved , they will couple to the observable Ψ ( t ) such that it ﬁrst departs from and later relaxes back towards its equilibrium value . This is known as the Kovacs - eﬀect . The state of the hidden degrees of freedom depends on the entire history of the process . Thus the presence of a signiﬁcant Kovacs - hump demonstrates that memory ef - fects are crucial . In recent years the Kovacs temperature protocol was applied e . g . on glass systems [ 35 – 38 ] , molec - ular liquids [ 39 ] , but also on non - equilibrium systems like driven granular gases [ 40 – 42 ] . In the latter case the role of the temperature is replaced by a driving force . In this Letter , we investigate the Kovacs - eﬀect for a system of interacting polar active particles that are subject to an - gular noise , where the noise strength η takes over the role of the temperature . Surprisingly , we observe a giant Kovacs - hump that re - veals the presence of strong memory eﬀects . A reduced description via density and polar order parameter in the manner of Toner and Tu is not incorporating such history - dependent eﬀects and thus is not suﬃcient to de - scribe this particular polar active gas . We ﬁnd that the Kovacs protocol does not lead to a speedup of the relax - ation towards the ﬁnal steady state . On the contrary , due to the giant Kovacs - eﬀect a slower relaxation is ob - served . Speaking in analogy to the thermal system de - scribed above , this means that the temporal increase of the heat bath temperature to T 2 results in a slower heat - ing of the system . This result is highly counterintuitive and contradicts a linear theory on the Kovacs - eﬀect [ 43 ] . In this Letter , we develop a quantitative nonlinear the - ory relating the giant Kovacs - eﬀect to two types of relax - ation curves by employing a much more general frame - work than the present active matter system . With this central result we achieve an intuitive understanding of the eﬀect . It becomes clear that a separation of time a r X i v : 170 5 . 05275v1 [ c ond - m a t . s t a t - m ec h ] 15 M a y 2017 2 scales in one of the relaxation curves is responsible for the appearance of the giant Kovacs - hump . Here , we consider a two - dimensional Vicsek - like model for self - propelled particles with bounded conﬁdence in - teractions , introduced in [ 27 ] . Bounded conﬁdence inter - actions have been studied ﬁrst in the context of opinion formation models [ 44 , 45 ] to mimic the tendency to ignore others with opposite opinions . One motivation for such interactions are experiments on the collective motion of Bacillus subtilis [ 46 ] , where the authors propose weaker interactions between cells with increasing orientation dif - ference . In the Vicsek model , all particles move at con - stant speed in individual directions . For a streaming pe - riod of unit time they evolve ballistically and afterwards they interact instantaneously . Each particle adopts the mean direction of motion of all particles that are no fur - ther away than some interaction distance and that move in a direction that diﬀers by no more than the angle α from the particles own direction . Note , that in that way each particle interacts at least with itself . Then all parti - cle directions are disturbed by a random deviation ξ that is drawn for each particle independently from the interval [ − η / 2 , η / 2 ] . Considering only spatially homogeneous solutions one obtains a time evolution equation for the angular dis - tribution of the particle directions . Assuming molecular chaos and a low particle density M this equation is explic - itly given in angular Fourier space [ 27 , 29 ] by a hierarchy of equations x k ( t + 1 ) = λ k (cid:110) A k x k + ∞ (cid:88) q = 1 x q (cid:2) B k x | k − q | + C k x k + q (cid:3)(cid:111) ( 1 ) with x 0 = 12 π at all times . The coeﬃcients λ k ( η , M ) , A k ( M , α ) , B k ( M , α ) and C k ( M , α ) can be found in the supplemental material [ 47 ] . In real space , the angular distribution is then given by p ( θ ) = (cid:80) ∞ k = 0 x k cos ( kθ ) . For practical computations we have to truncate the Fourier series after ﬁnitely many terms , setting x k = 0 for k > n . Here , we use n = 100 or n = 200 . We denote the vector of Fourier modes ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) by x . As an observable we consider the polar order parameter Ψ : = (cid:104) cos ( θ ) (cid:105) = πx 1 . If the system is perfectly ordered , all particles move in the same direction and Ψ = 1 . If , in contrast , the directions of all particles are completely random , we have Ψ = 0 . Linearizing in the change of temperature , which corre - sponds to a change in η in our case , the following rela - tion between the Kovacs - hump Ψ ( t ) and the relaxation curve Ψ 1 f was derived in Ref . [ 43 ] by means of a Master - equation approach Ψ ( t ) = 1 1 − γ Ψ 1 f ( t ) − γ 1 − γ Ψ 1 f ( t − t w ) , ( 2 ) γ = Ψ 1 f ( t w ) − Ψ ∗ η f Ψ 1 f ( 0 ) − Ψ ∗ η f . ( 3 ) By Ψ 1 f ( t ) we denote the order parameter , when the sys - tem is prepared at t = 0 in the steady state of noise strength η 1 and for t > 0 the noise strength is switched to η f . The steady state value of the order parameter at noise strength η is denoted by Ψ ∗ η . As long as the relax - ation curve Ψ 1 f is monotone , it follows from Eq . ( 3 ) that γ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , and hence Ψ ( t ) (cid:40) > Ψ 1 f if Ψ 1 f is increasing < Ψ 1 f if Ψ 1 f is decreasing . ( 4 ) We evaluated the time evolution map ( 1 ) numerically and changed the noise strength according to the Kovacs - protocol . The results are displayed in Fig . 1 . In the same plot we also present results of agent based simulations , where positions z j and directions θ j of the j th particle are updated according to the streaming rule z j ( t + 1 ) = z j ( t ) + v 0 (cid:18) sin ( θ j ) cos ( θ j ) (cid:19) ( 5 ) with particle speed v 0 , and the collision rule ˜ θ j = Φ j + ξ j , Φ j = arg (cid:34) (cid:88) l ∈ { j } exp ( iθ l ) (cid:35) , ( 6 ) where ˜ θ j denotes the post - collisional coordinate of the j th particle and ξ j are independent random variables that are drawn uniformly from the interval [ − η / 2 , η / 2 ] . The set { j } contains the indices of all particles that interact with the j th particle according to the bounded conﬁdence rule . There is good agreement between agent based sim - ulations and kinetic theory ( 1 ) . We clearly ﬁnd that the Kovacs - eﬀect is present in this system . In Fig . 1 where the waiting time t w = 8 is very small , the linear theory ( 2 ) agrees well with the data . However , for a diﬀerent parameter set , in particular a smaller α = 0 . 35 π , and for the inverse Kovacs - protocol with η 1 > η f > η 2 , displayed in Fig . 2 , we immediately recognize that the Kovacs - hump Ψ ( t ) and the relaxation curve Ψ 1 f ( t ) intersect . That means the relaxation to - wards the ﬁnal steady state under the Kovacs - protocol is slower than the direct relaxation from η 1 to η f . This surprising result clearly violates condition ( 4 ) which is a consequence of the linear theory ( 2 ) . The Kovacs - hump is giant compared to the predictions of the linear theory ( dashed black line in Fig . 2 ) . In the supplemental mate - rial [ 47 ] we rederive Eq . ( 2 ) for time discrete dynamical systems linearizing the time evolution map as a function of the system state and of the noise strength . We ar - gue that this linearized theory is only applicable if the waiting time is short . Thus , in the present case , the lin - ear theory is not suﬃcient to describe the system and nonlinear eﬀects are crucial . Developing a nonlinear theory , we ﬁnd that the vector of Fourier modes x ( t ) obtained from the Kovacs - protocol 3 0 . 890 0 . 895 0 . 900 0 . 905 Ψ Ψ 1 f Ψ ( t ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 t 0 . 40 0 . 45 η FIG . 1 .

The linear theory ( 2 ) ( dashed black line ) describes the Kovacs - eﬀect well for short t w = 8 . System parameters are α = 0 . 47 π , M = 0 . 2 , η 1 = 0 . 3797 , η 2 = 0 . 4553 , η f = 0 . 3940 [ 48 ] .

The relaxation curves Ψ 1 f ( t ) , Ψ 2 f ( t ) ( dash - dotted line ) and the Kovacs - hump Ψ ( t ) ( solid red line ) obtained from the kinetic theory ( 1 ) are in good agreement with agent - based simulations ( light green and light red thick line , respectively ) . The linear theory ( 2 ) ( dashed black line ) fails to describe the Kovacs - hump whereas the nonlinear theory ( 7 ) with time shift ˆ t = 332 ( dotted blue line ) agrees well . Parameters are α = 0 . 35 π , M = 0 . 2 , t w = 742 , η 1 = 0 . 3354 , η 2 = 0 . 2017 , η f = 0 . 2884 [ 49 ] . for t ≥ t w is related to both relaxation curves x 1 f and x 2 f by the following central result x ( t ) = x 2 f ( t − t w ) + x 1 f ( t − ˆ t ) − x 2 f ( t − ˆ t ) ( 7 ) We derive this equation not by linearizing the time evo - lution Eq . ( 1 ) itself but only the change of the system’s state after t w . Furthermore , we do not linearize in the change of the noise strength but we take a strong non - linear dependence of the relaxation speed on the noise strength into account , see supplemental material [ 47 ] for details . The ﬁrst vector component of Eq . ( 7 ) yields the corresponding relation for the order parameter Ψ = πx 1 but Eq . ( 7 ) is more general , yielding a relation for all Fourier modes . The time shift ˆ t in Eq . ( 7 ) depends on the change of the relaxation speed when η is switched ( see [ 47 ] for more details ) . The right - hand - side of Eq . ( 7 ) is displayed as the blue dotted line in Fig . 2 . We see that it coincides very well with the Kovacs - hump . We discuss a plot of the second Fourier mode of the same process in [ 47 ] . With the help of Eq . ( 7 ) we can understand why the Kovacs - eﬀect is so large . We ﬁnd that the derivative of Ψ ( t ) at t = t w is given by Ψ (cid:48) 2 f ( 0 ) + Ψ (cid:48) 1 f ( t w − ˆ t ) − Ψ (cid:48) 2 f ( t w − ˆ t ) . In the present case , the relaxation curve Ψ 2 f is decay - ing very fast in the beginning and both relaxation curves are decaying much slower at later times , cf . Fig . 2 . Since | Ψ (cid:48) 1 f ( t ) | and | Ψ (cid:48) 2 f ( t ) | are of comparable size , the term Ψ (cid:48) 2 f ( 0 ) is dominant . That means a fast relaxation of Ψ 2 f at t = 0 leads to a fast and therefore strong change of Ψ ( t ) in a short period after t = t w . Thus , whenever | Ψ (cid:48) 1 f | ∼ | Ψ (cid:48) 2 f | and Ψ 2 f is relaxing very fast in the begin - ning and much slower at later times we expect a giant Kovacs - eﬀect . The derivation of Eq . ( 7 ) is not system speciﬁc but it is valid for a wide class of systems with the following two properties . ( i ) In the relaxation dynamics there must be a separation of time scales . In particular there has to be one mode that relaxes much slower than all others such that at t w we can assume that all modes but one are already completely relaxed . ( ii ) Furthermore , we need to assume that this slow mode is not too sensitive to changes in η and t such that the slowest relaxation mode for η 2 is approximately equal to the one at η f . For the present system these properties are numerically veriﬁed ( see supplemental material [ 47 ] for more details ) . They can also be understood intuitively . Assume a large population of particles moves into direction θ = 0 . Then they interact only with others that move in a direction from the interval [ − α , α ] . For α = 0 . 35 π this interval is a little larger than 2 π / 3 . Particles that have direc - tions outside this interval can not interact with the ﬁrst population . Therefore , it is possible that there is a sec - ond , relatively large , population of particles that move into the opposite direction θ = π . Then , the interaction intervals of both populations are disjoint and all parti - cles can interact only with either the ﬁrst or the second population . Particles can be driven from one population to the other only by noise . For small noise strength this process is very slow , in particular because the interaction of particles within the same population acts against this noise driven mechanism . In contrast , the concentration of particles that belong to one population due to aligning interactions is a much faster process . 4 Thus , we identiﬁed a very slow relaxation process in the system : the noise driven reorientation of a group of particles moving in the opposite direction than the majority . This relaxation process is very robust against moderate changes in noise strength . Although the relax - ation speed depends strongly on the noise strength , the mechanism remains the slowest dynamics as long as the noise is not too strong . In the derivation of Eq . ( 7 ) we neither use that the initial conﬁguration is a steady state nor that the order parameter Ψ ( t w ) = Ψ ( t → ∞ ) ( see [ 47 ] ) . Thus Eq . ( 7 ) is applicable to more general pro - tocols than the Kovacs experiment . We conjecture that Eq . ( 7 ) might also be valid for completely diﬀerent types of systems with slow dynamics like e . g . driven granu - lar gases or spin glasses . This conjecture can be veriﬁed theoretically or experimentally by measuring the Kovacs - hump as well as the relaxation curves Ψ 1 f and Ψ 2 f in diﬀerent types of systems . The time shift ˆ t might be ob - tained from theoretical calculations speciﬁc to the system or simply from a ﬁt of experimental or simulation data . For one speciﬁc granular gas we verify Eq . ( 7 ) explicitly . In Refs . [ 40 , 42 ] the dynamics of a driven granular gas is given by ordinary diﬀerential equations , Eqs . ( 6a ) and ( 6b ) in Ref . [ 40 ] . Evaluating these equations numerically we obtain the Kovacs - hump Ψ ( t ) as well as the relaxation curves Ψ 1 f ( t ) and Ψ 2 f ( t ) , such that we can test the va - lidity of Eq . ( 7 ) . In order to satisfy conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) we must choose intermediate and ﬁnal noise intensi - ties close to each other . In that way we assure that the waiting time t w is long and that the slowest relaxation mode can be approximated as constant . In Fig . 3 we show the anomalous Kovacs - eﬀect for the driven granu - lar gas of Refs . [ 40 , 42 ] . We ﬁnd that also the anomalous eﬀect is described well by Eq . ( 7 ) whereas the linear the - ory ( 2 ) fails completely . We can understand why the Kovacs - hump has the opposite sign by investigating the derivative of Eq . ( 7 ) . In the present case | Ψ (cid:48) 1 f | (cid:29) | Ψ (cid:48) 2 f | and hence the term Ψ (cid:48) 1 f ( t − ˆ t ) is dominant , causing the anomalous eﬀect . For spin glasses , property ( i ) is not realistic but it can be replaced by an alternative assumption . Consider the coherence length l of a spin glass such that length scales smaller than l are equilibrated and length scales larger than l are frozen . The coherence length depends on the age of the system . Turning it around , one ﬁnds that the age of the system typically grows faster than expo - nentially with the coherence length [ 35 , 50 ] . Translating this picture into the framework of relaxing eigenmodes we assume the following property : ( i * ) After the wait - ing time t w some eigenmodes have relaxed completely , some others have not relaxed at all and there is a single mode which is partely relaxed . If ( i * ) holds instead of ( i ) , the derivation of Eq . ( 7 ) remains valid . The validity of Eq . ( 7 ) for spin glasses could be veriﬁed in the future . However , equilibrium states might be diﬃcult to prepare both in experiments and in simulations . Fortunately , as argued above , Eq . ( 7 ) also holds when the initial state 0 1 2 3 4 5 t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 1 − β [ 10 − 2 ] 1 2 3 4 0 . 64 0 . 66 0 . 68 FIG . 3 . Anomalous Kovacs - eﬀect for a driven granular gas . The order parameter β is related to the granular temperature . Displayed are relaxation curves ( green dash - dotted lines ) and the Kovacs - hump ( red solid line ) . The Kovacs - eﬀect is very small and shown in the inset in units of 10 − 2 . The nonlinear theory ( blue dotted line ) , Eq . ( 7 ) with ˆ t = 0 , describes the anomalous eﬀect well , the linear theory ( black dashed line ) , Eq . ( 2 ) , fails . is not an equilibrium state . Unfortunately the measure - ment of the relaxation curve x 2 f requires the preparation of the equilibrium state belonging to η = η 2 . However , Eq . ( 7 ) yields still insights on the system even if x 2 f can not be measured . The time shift ˆ t in Eq . ( 7 ) does not depend on the ini - tial conﬁguration but only on the intermediate and ﬁnal noise strength and the waiting time t w . Hence rewriting Eq . ( 7 ) as x ( t ) − x 1 f ( t − ˆ t ) = x 2 f ( t − t w ) − x 2 f ( t − ˆ t ) ( 8 ) we ﬁnd that the right - hand - side is independent on the ini - tial conﬁguration . Therefore also the left - hand - side must be identical for diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations . Even if equilibrium states can not be prepared in an experimen - tal or simulation setup , the quantities on the left - hand - side of Eq . ( 8 ) can still be measured . Comparing them for diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations Eq . ( 8 ) can be veriﬁed and one could extract information on the relaxation from one equilibrium state to another without preparing any equilibrium state at all . In summary , we observe a giant Kovacs - memory - eﬀect in an active matter system , both , in agent based simula - tions and in kinetic theory . The eﬀect is unexpected as it contradicts a well - known linear theory . Furthermore , it shows that the Turner - Tu equations are not suﬃcient to describe the dynamics of the polar active gas inves - tigated here . We develop a quantitative nonlinear the - ory that connects the Kovacs - hump with two relaxation curves . We conclude that the giant eﬀect is caused by a fast relaxation on short time scales and a slow relaxation on large time scales . We also apply the nonlinear theory to a driven granular gas where it succeeds to quantita - tively describe the anomalous Kovacs - eﬀect . We further 5 propose experimental validations and applications to spin glasses and other disordered systems . We thank A . Prados for detailed insights in driven granular gases . We thank T .

[ 48 ] Since the density M = 0 . 2 is not that small the descrip - tion by the kinetic theory ( 1 ) is not perfect and the steady state of the real system is slightly diﬀerent . To compare kinetic theory and simulations we used slightly diﬀerent noise strengths for the simulation , such that the steady state value of the order parameter coincides with the ki - netic theory for all three noise strengths . Simulation pa - rameters are η 1 = 0 . 38 , η 2 = 0 . 46 , η f = 0 . 395 . [ 49 ] Analogously to [ 48 ] simulation noise strengths diﬀer min - imally : η 1 = 0 . 34 , η 2 = 0 . 197 , η f = 0 . 29 .

[ 51 ] To determine the largest eigenvalue of [ H tη ] L we ﬁx a small parameter δ , here δ = 0 . 01 . We start with the initial vector x given by x 1 = 1 and x i = 0 for i > 1 . We then replace x by H tη ( δ · x ) / | | H tη ( δ · x ) | | , such that always | | x | | = 1 . This step is repeated many times . In this way all eigenvectors but the one that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue decay . Eventually x converges and the largest eigenvalue is obtained by λ η , t 1 = | | H tη ( δ · x ) | | / δ and x is the corresponding eigenvector . 6 Supplemental Material to ’Giant Kovacs - Like Memory Eﬀect for Active Particles’ I . NONLINEAR THEORY In the following we give the derivation of Eq . ( 7 ) . Consider a family of maps F η : R n → R n . In the present system the map F is given by Eq . ( 1 ) . We assume that each map has a single globally attractive stable ﬁxed point x ∗ η such that F η ( x ∗ η ) = x ∗ η . We deﬁne the shifted coordinate y and map G η by y : = x − x ∗ η f , G η ( y ) : = F η ( y + x ∗ η f ) − x ∗ η f ( S . 1 ) such that G η f ( 0 ) = 0 . ( S . 2 ) We denote the ﬁxed point of G η by y ∗ η : = x ∗ η − x ∗ η f . ( S . 3 ) Furthermore we deﬁne the relaxation map H η ( y − y ∗ η ) : = G η ( y ) − y η f ( S . 4 ) which has the property that lim t →∞ H tη ( y ) = 0 . Let y ( t = 0 ) = y ∗ η 1 , ( S . 5 ) for 0 < t ≤ t w y ( t ) = G tη 2 ( y ( t = 0 ) ) = G tη 2 ( y ∗ η 1 ) = y ∗ η 2 + H tη 2 ( y ∗ η 1 − y ∗ η 2 ) ( S . 6 ) and for t > t w y ( t ) = G t − t w η ∗ ( y ( t w ) ) = G t − t w η f ( y ∗ η 2 + H t w η 2 ( y ∗ η 1 − y ∗ η 2 ) ) = H t − t w η f ( y ∗ η 2 + H t w η 2 ( y ∗ η 1 − y ∗ η 2 ) ) ( S . 7 ) where the last line follows from y ∗ η f = 0 . So far we have only formulated the dynamics of the system and Eq . ( S . 7 ) is exact . Assuming that the changes of the noise strength η 1 − η f and η 2 − η f are small , of order ε , and neglecting all terms of higher order than ε we rederive Eq . ( 2 ) , cf . Sec . II . In a diﬀerent approach we keep the full dependence on the changes of the noise strength by now . We replace H t − t w η f by its linearization (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L such that Eq . ( S . 7 ) becomes y ( t ) ≈ (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L ( y ∗ η 2 ) + (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L ( H t w η 2 ( y ∗ η 1 − y ∗ η 2 ) ) ≈ H t − t w η f ( y ∗ η 2 ) + (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L ( H t w η 2 ( y ∗ η 1 − y ∗ η 2 ) ) = y 2 f ( t − t w ) + (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L ( H t w η 2 ( y ∗ η 1 − y ∗ η 2 ) ) ( S . 8 ) Furthermore we also replace the map H t w η 2 by its linearization (cid:2) H t w η 2 (cid:3) L and hence Eq . ( S . 8 ) becomes y ( t ) = y 2 f ( t − t w ) + (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L ( (cid:2) H t w η 2 (cid:3) L ( y ∗ η 1 ) ) − (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L ( (cid:2) H t w η 2 (cid:3) L ( y ∗ η 2 ) ) . ( S . 9 ) We denote the eigenvalues of (cid:2) H tη (cid:3) L by λ η , t 1 ≥ λ η , t 2 ≥ · · · ≥ λ η , t n and the corresponding eigenvectors by v η , t 1 , v η , t 2 , . . . , v η , t n . For t = t w we assume a separation of time scales , property ( i ) which is checked numerically below , that means λ η , t w 1 (cid:29) λ η , t w 2 . ( S . 10 ) Therefore we can assume that at t w only the ﬁrst eigenvector is relevant and all others are much smaller , thus (cid:2) H t w η 2 (cid:3) L ( y ) = n (cid:88) k = 1 λ η 2 , t w k ( y · v η 2 , t w k ) v η 2 , t w k ≈ λ η 2 , t w 1 ( y · v η 2 , t w 1 ) v η 2 , t w 1 ( S . 11 ) 7 We further assume that the eigenvector belonging to the largest eigenvalue is not sensitive to moderate changes in η and t , property ( ii ) which is checked numerically below . That means we assume that v η 2 , t w 1 ≈ v η f , ˜ t 1 ( S . 12 ) when ˜ t has the same order of magnitude as t w . Then we choose ˜ t such that λ η 2 , t w 1 = λ η f , ˜ t 1 ( S . 13 ) and hence from Eq . ( S . 11 ) we obtain (cid:2) H t w η 2 (cid:3) L ( y ) ≈ λ η 2 , t w 1 ( y · v η 2 , t w 1 ) v η 2 , t w 1 ≈ λ η f , ˜ t 1 ( y · v η f , ˜ t 1 ) v η f , ˜ t 1 ≈ (cid:2) H ˜ tη f (cid:3) L ( y ) . ( S . 14 ) Plugging this expression into Eq . ( S . 9 ) we obtain y ( t ) = y 2 f ( t − t w ) + (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L ( (cid:2) H ˜ tη f (cid:3) L ( y ∗ η 1 ) ) − (cid:2) H t − t w η f (cid:3) L ( (cid:2) H ˜ tη f (cid:3) L ( y ∗ η 2 ) ) ≈ y 2 f ( t − t w ) + H t − t w η f ( H ˜ tη f ( y ∗ η 1 ) ) − H t − t w η f ( (cid:2) H ˜ tη f ( y ∗ η 2 ) ) = y 2 f ( t − t w ) + y 1 f ( t + ˜ t − t w ) − y 2 f ( t + ˜ t − t w ) ( S . 15 ) Resubstituting y according to Eq . ( S . 1 ) and introducing the abbreviation ˆ t : = t w − ˜ t ( S . 16 ) we obtain Eq . ( 7 ) . The basic assumptions in the derivation of Eq . ( 7 ) are properties i ) and ii ) that are mathematically given by the conditions ( S . 10 ) and ( S . 12 ) . In the letter , we have argued intuitively that these assumptions should be valid in the present system . For the example presented in Fig . 2 we can also explicitly verify those conditions numerically . The time evolution map F is explicitly given by Eq . ( 1 ) . Evolving the system for a very long time we obtain the stable ﬁxed point of the map . Thus we can also evolve the map H , cf . Eq . ( S . 4 ) . To verify condition ( S . 10 ) we need to obtain the eigenvalues λ η , t i of [ H tη ] L . As a rough estimate we can instead calculate the eigenvalues λ ηi of [ H η ] L and assume λ η , t i ∼ ( λ ηi ) t . Given the ﬁxed point of the system , the linearization of H η can be performed analytically . For the parameters of Fig . 2 we obtain for the two largest eigenvalues ( λ η 2 1 ) t w ≈ 8 . 2 × 10 − 2 (cid:29) ( λ η 2 2 ) t w ≈ 1 . 6 × 10 − 7 . ( S . 17 ) Thus our assumption ( S . 10 ) is valid . To verify the condition ( S . 12 ) we use a robust numerical procedure to obtain the largest eigenvalue and the corre - sponding eigenvector of [ H tη ] L [ 51 ] . For parameters like in Fig . 2 we ﬁnd that Eq . ( S . 13 ) is valid for ˜ t = 408 . Knowing ˜ t we can calculate the scalar product of the normalized eigenvectors v η 2 , t w 1 · v η f , ˜ t 1 ≈ 0 . 963 which indicates that the eigenvector v 1 did not change a lot and Eq . ( S . 12 ) is a reasonable assumption . As we have predicted the value of ˜ t we can also calculate the time shift ˆ t = 337 according to Eq . ( S . 16 ) . In Fig . 2 we used the time shift ˆ t = 332 that was chosen such that the Kovacs - hump has the correct value at t = t w . Hence our numerical prediction for ˆ t deviates by about 1 % from the correct value . This is not surprising since the assumption ( S . 12 ) is not satisﬁed perfectly and also the linearization of H tη might introduce some deviations . Our result ( 7 ) describes a relation between vectors of all Fourier modes . Thus it is holding not only for the polar order parameter Ψ = πg 1 which corresponds to the ﬁrst Fourier mode but it is much more general . In Fig . S1 we show the relaxation curves and the Kovacs - hump of the second Fourier mode following the same Kovacs - protocol as the order parameter in Fig . 2 . We ﬁnd that the relation ( 7 ) ﬁts the data well using the same time shift ˆ t as in Fig . 2 . II . LINEAR THEORY We assume that η 1 − η f = a 1 ε , η 2 − η f = a 2 ε , ( S . 18 ) 8 t 0 . 65 0 . 70 0 . 75 0 . 80 0 . 85 0 . 90 x 2 x 2 , η 2 → η f x 2 , η 1 → η f x 2 ( t ) 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 t 0 . 2 0 . 3 η FIG . S1 . The relaxation curves x 2 , η 1 → η f ( t ) , x 2 , η 2 → η f ( t ) ( dash - dotted line ) and the Kovacs - hump x 2 ( t ) ( solid red line ) of the second Fourier mode g 2 obtained from the kinetic theory ( 1 ) are in good agreement with agent - based simulations ( light green and light red thick line , respectively ) . The nonlinear theory ( 7 ) with the same time shift as in Fig . 2 , ˆ t = 332 , ( dotted blue line ) ﬁts well . Parameters are as in Fig . 2 . where ε is small and a 1 and a 2 are of similar size , a 1 , a 2 ∼ 1 . We expand the ﬁxed points y ∗ η 1 = εa 1 y ∗ 0 + O ( ε 2 ) , y ∗ η 2 = εa 2 y ∗ 0 + O ( ε 2 ) ( S . 19 ) for some constant vector y ∗ 0 . Inserting these ﬁxed points into the exact expression ( S . 7 ) we obtain y ( t ) = H t − t w η f ( εa 2 y ∗ 0 + H t w η 2 ( ε ( a 1 − a 2 ) y ∗ 0 + O ( ε 2 ) ) + O ( ε 2 ) ) = H t − t w η f ( ε [ a 2 y ∗ 0 + ( a 1 − a 2 ) ( [ H η 2 ] L ) t w ( y ∗ 0 ) ] + O ( ε 2 ) ) , ( S . 20 ) where [ H η 2 ] L denotes the linearization of H η 2 . The linear map [ H η 2 ] L depends on ε via η 2 and thus we can expand it for small ε . Only the leading term is necessary since we neglect terms of order ε 2 . Thus we obtain y ( t ) = H t − t w η f ( ε [ a 2 y ∗ 0 + ( a 1 − a 2 ) ( [ H η f ] L ) t w ( y ∗ 0 ) ] + O ( ε 2 ) ) . ( S . 21 ) Since the map [ H η 2 ] L is applied t w times , terms of order ε 2 come with a prefactor of t w . Therefore they can be neglected only if 1 / ε (cid:29) t w . For not too small changes in η and long waiting times this assumption is not maintainable and the linear theory cannot be applied . This is the reason why Eq . ( 2 ) fails completely for long waiting times . Continuing the expansion of Eq . ( S . 21 ) for small ε we obtain y ( t ) = ε ( [ H η f ] L ) t − t w ( a 2 y ∗ 0 + ( a 1 − a 2 ) ( [ H η f ] L ) t w ( y ∗ 0 ) ) + O ( ε 2 ) = a 2 a 1 ( [ H η f ] L ) t − t w ( εa 1 y ∗ 0 ) + a 1 − a 2 a 1 ( [ H η f ] L ) t w ( εa 1 y ∗ 0 ) + O ( ε 2 ) = a 2 a 1 y 1 f ( t − t w ) + a 1 − a 2 a 1 y 1 f ( t ) + O ( ε 2 ) ( S . 22 ) Evaluating this equation at t = 0 , resubstituting x according to Eq . ( S . 3 ) and observing only x 1 = Ψ / π we ﬁnd γ according to Eq . ( 3 ) as γ = a 2 a 2 − a 1 . ( S . 23 ) With this abbreviation Eq . ( S . 22 ) becomes y ( t ) = 1 1 − γ y η 1 → η f ( t ) − γ 1 − γ y η 1 → η f ( t − t w ) . ( S . 24 ) From the ﬁrst vector component of this equation we obtain Eq . ( 2 ) . Thus we rederived the linearized theory [ 43 ] in the context of time - discrete dynamical systems . 9 0 π 2 π θ 10 − 3 10 − 2 10 − 1 10 0 10 1 p ( θ ) FIG . S2 . Angular probability density p ( θ ) during the Kovacs - protocol at diﬀerent times before t w = 742 : t = 0 ( black solid line ) , t = 100 ( red dashed line ) and t = 700 ( blue dotted line ) . Parameters like in Fig . 2 . III . SLOW RELAXATION MECHANISM In this section , we discuss the slow relaxation mechanism that leads to strong memory eﬀects . In Fig . S2 , we display snap shots of the angular probability density at times t = 0 , 100 , 700 < t w following the relaxation from η 2 to η f which is the ﬁrst part of the Kovacs - protocol presented in Fig . 2 . The direction of the majority of the particles is centered around ( 0 mod 2 π ) . After t = 100 this dominating peak is already relaxed towards its steady state shape . However , there is a small population of particles that move in the opposite direction θ = π . Due to the bounded conﬁdence interaction rule , these particles do not interact with the large group of particles that move in direction θ = 0 . Therefore they reorient mainly due to noise . If the noise strength is small , this process is very slow and it takes a long time until the population moving into direction θ = π has reorientated and the system has reached its steady state . Apparently this noise driven mechanism is the slowest relaxation mode of the system . Moderate changes of the noise strength change the relaxation speed signiﬁcantly , however , the noise driven reorientation of a minor population remains the slowest relaxation mode of the system .
