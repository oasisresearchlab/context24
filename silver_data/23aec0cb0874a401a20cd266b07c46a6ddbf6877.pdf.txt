Dickson Robert L . Leitheiser James C . Wetherbe School of Management University of Minnesota Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 By : Mal Nechis IBM Corporation White Plains , New York 10601 Abstract Knowledge of the most important issues in the informa - tion systems field would help focus research and educational efforts . A Delphi study , using leading infor - mation systems ( IS ) professionals , was used to identify and rank ten key IS management issues for the 1980 ' s . Measures were also taken of the amount of agreement achieved on these issues and rankings . The number one issue identified was improved IS planning , followed by facilitation and management of end user computing . This article describes the research approach involved and discusses the results . This research was funded by the Society for Information Management and the MIS Research Center , School of Management , University of Minnesota . Keywords : Delphi technique , priorities , MIS ACM Categories : K . 3 . 2 , K . 6 . 0 Introduction The information systems profession is continually faced with making difficult decisions about the commitment of its limited management , research , and educational resources . Organizations make judgements about importance when they fund research projects and establish conference themes and topics . Businesses and government agencies make resource decisions that affect their profitability and effectiveness . Many issues exist , but which are the most crucial ? A clear iden - tification of key issues would help in decision - making , but a widely accepted and current assessment of the important management issues in information systems does not exist . In a joint effort to meet this need , the Society for Information Management ( SIM ) and the MIS Re - search Center ( MISRC ) at the University of Min - nesota conducted a survey of leading information systems practitioners and academics . The pur - pose of the study was to answer three questions : 1 . What are the ten most important IS manage - ment issues as seen by leading information systems professionals ? 2 . What is the order of importance of these issues ? 3 . How much agreement do these IS profes - sionals have about these issues ? In answering these questions , this study utilized a Delphi approach to collect and combine the opin - ions of the many IS professionals who parti - cipated . This is a new application for the tech - nique and its contribution to the study findings is also examined . The Key Issues Information systems professionals have individual opinions about what comprise key IS manage - ment issues . Obtaining a general consensus from a leading group of IS professionals helps to iden - tify key issues for the whole profession . A Delphi survey approach was used to measure this col - lective view . The final round of the survey includ - ed 54 participants , almost all were practitioners at the director , vice - president , or consultant level . There were also four prominent information MIS Quarterly / September 1984 135 This content downloaded from 129 . 120 . 17 . 7 on Sat , 14 Dec 2013 15 : 27 : 59 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Information Systems Issues Table 1 .

The first issue , improved IS planning , has the most consensus about its rank - ing , with a standard deviation of only 1 . 5 and an interquartile range of 1 . Add to this , its inclusion by everyone in their top ten list and it can be safe - ly concluded that there was a high level of agree - ment in the group that planning is their number one issue . There was also much agreement about the low end . In particular , the sixteenth through nineteenth issues were consistently ranked as being less important than other issues . systems academics . A breakdown of the group by industry is given in Table 1 . The combined opinions of the group on the iden - tification and ranking of issues is given in Table 2 . The first ten issues , beginning with improved IS planning and finishing with development and im - plementation of decision support systems , make up the group ' s top ten key issues . Note that at least 64 % of the respondents selected each issue as a key issue . The selection rate of the eleventh issue is only half that of the tenth , in - dicating a clear break for the top ten . The second question concerned the relative im - portance of these key issues . The listing in Table 2 is orderd by the average rank score given to the issues by the IS professionals . The first two issues listed were clearly most important to the group . Improved IS planning received an average rank score of 9 . 1 out of a possible 10 . The sec - ond issue , facilitation and management of end user computing , received an average score of 7 . 4 out of 10 . The respondents ranked the tenth issue much lower , giving it a mean rank score of only 1 . 5 . The ranking was also analyzed by com - puting median values for the rank scores . As can be seen in the third column of Table 2 , these values did not change the order of the issue rankings . The last question addressed the amount of agree - ment between IS professionals about these key issues . A Delphi approach was used to increase the level of consensus over what a standard survey would achieve . Some measure of this con - sensus is found in the standard deviation and in - terquartile range columns in Table 2 . The larger these values are , the less consensus there is Discussion of issue ranking There are no surprises in this ranking . The first place position of improved IS planning matches the top priority found in a survey by Ball and Har - ris [ 1 ] , ( see Table 3 ) . This issue ' s importance is reflected in the significant research efforts and professional programs that have been directed at it . For example , the Society for Information Management selected " Strategic Planning and In - formation Management " as the topic for its 1 982 annual conference . With this widespread recogni - tion of IS planning as a critical issue , it is not sur - prising to find such a high degree of consensus about its first place ranking . The importance of facilitating and managing end user computing is also coming to be widely felt . Several of the Ball and Harris issues correspond to parts of this issue , but no clear comparison is possible . The information systems literature , however , indicates an increasing concern about the end user issue [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] . The high level of con - sensus about this issue in the survey is evidence of its pervasiveness . Caution should be used in evaluating the final ranking . We often find that it is the less obvious issues that become the biggest concerns . For ex - ample , five years before the personal computer emerged as a major force for facilitating end - user computing , there was little discussion or awareness of its potential impact . One issue that was ranked low , but may become much more important by the end of this decade , is the impact of artificial intelligence ( listed 18th in Table 2 ) . While few IS professionals in this survey felt that it was a crucial issue , it is now receiving increasing attention because of the Japanese fifth 136 MIS Quarterly / September 1984 This content downloaded from 129 . 120 . 17 . 7 on Sat , 14 Dec 2013 15 : 27 : 59 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Information Systems Issues Table 2 .

How should this measure - ment and updating be done ? The remainder of this article will discuss the use of the Delphi ap - proach to obtain and rank issues . Delphi Approach Previous studies It is useful to compare the process used here with that of other surveys . In 1980 , Ball and Harris surveyed SIM members to determine , in part , what levels of importance they gave to 18 IS management issues . A total of 417 responses were received and analyzed ( 30 % response rate ) . The set of issues ( determined ahead of time by the authors ) were rated on a six point Likert - type scale that ranged from " Not Important " ( 1 ) to " Very Important " ( 6 ) . Table 3 shows their ranking of management issues by mean importance rating . Standard deviations were given as measures of agreement among respondents about the rating . The researchers noted that some of the issues ' ratings could have been af - fected by their wording . Since there was only one round of rating , there was no opportunity to use survey feedback to change wordings . Another possible factor influencing results was the inability of the respondents to suggest issues which could be reviewed by the whole group . Perhaps impor - tant issues were not included in the list of eigh - teen created by the researchers . A much different approach was taken by Martin [ 5 ] . In this study , Martin had 15 chief IS exec - utives write down their " Critical Success Factors " . These CSF ' s were then summarized and returned to the same executives for review . The respondents were given the opportunity to change or add to their list of factors and eight of them did so . Table 4 lists the CSF ' s and the number of executives who mentioned them . The CSF wording and boundaries were determined by the researcher . The resulting definitions of the factors are so different from the issues used in the Ball and Harris study , and those used in the present study , that comparison is difficult . The CSF ' s tended to be less specific than the issues . It is important to note that substantive changes were made during the second round of the CSF Table 4 .

This suggests that multiple rounds and open issue solicitation may produce different results than those of the Ball and Harris survey . Survey approach The Ball and Harris and Martin studies provided valuable information about key IS management issues . The questions raised by their methodologies , however , warranted further in - vestigation . The current study uses a different ap - proach to achieve a similar goal . A professional group ( the Society for Information Management ' s institutional members and prominent academics ) contributed first to the creation of a list of key IS management issues and then to the ordering of the issues within the list . A Delphi approach was used not only to identify and rank the issues but also to gain consensus about them . It included an initial open issue solicitation step with multiple rounds of feedback . The study was conducted using mail survey forms ( sample is given in appen - dix A1 ) in the following four - step process . Round One : Each participant was asked to identify and briefly describe five to ten of what MIS Quarterly / September 1984 139 This content downloaded from 129 . 120 . 17 . 7 on Sat , 14 Dec 2013 15 : 27 : 59 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Information Systems Issues they consider to be the major IS management issues of the next five to ten years . Each respon - dent was also asked to contribute a rationale for including each issue . Fifty - two responses were returned to the MISRC and consolidated into a combined list of issues and rationales . Round Two : The combined list was mailed to all participants who were then requested to select the ten most important issues and to prioritize them . One hundred and two rankings were return - ed to the MISRC and used to determine an ag - gregate group ranking . The aggregate ranking was used to reorder the list of issues and rationales . Round Three : Each participant was mailed the new list with feedback showing their individual ranking related to the aggregate ranking . Based upon this information , each participant had the op - portunity to change their ranks . If their new ranks differed substantially from the group ' s ( i . e . , were more than 3 rank scores away ) , they were asked to provide additional rationales which were to be shared anonymously during round four . This allowed participants to influence rankings by poin - ting out concerns that others may have over - looked . Sixty - two responses were received . A new aggregate group ranking was established and the rationales were compiled into short lists for each issue . Round Four : The new group ranking , the old group ranking , and both previous individual rank - ings were sent to continuing participants along with the lists of contributed rationales . Respondents were asked to review the rankings and rationales and then to determine a final rank - ing . Fifty - four rankings were received and com - bined to create the final consolidated group rank - ing of issues . This process provides a systematic way of ex - changing and combining valuable , but often diverse perspectives . All data consolidation and analysis was handled at the MIS Research Center at the University of Minnesota . The survey was conducted over six months in 1 982 - 1983 . The ranking process The following sections describe the process used for obtaining the key issue ranking . The results of the ranking are interesting and useful , but it is also important to understand how they were derived . First , the creation of the list of key issues and their rationales is covered . This list was the basis for all of the subsequent steps . Second , the selection and ranking of the top ten IS manage - ment issues is presented . Third , the amount of consensus or agreement that was reached by the survey participants is examined , in particular the movement over the three final rounds toward more rank consensus . Finally , the question of " whole " group vs . " final " group response in the second and third rounds is dealt with . Initial List of Issues and Rationales In the first round 52 respondents ( N = 52 ) con - tributed issues and rationales . These were categorized and summarized into nineteen key issues and rationales by the staff at the MIS Research Center . Substantial judgement was re - quired to define the issue boundaries and to sum - marize the rationales . The list of issues in their final wording is given in Table 1 . The rationales are given on the Survey form in Appendix A1 . The percentage of respondents who mentioned an issue or a sub - issue give some indication of its importance . For example , 58 . 5 % of the respon - dents to the first round listed improved IS plan - ning , or something like it , as a key management issue . Only 3 . 8 % mentioned effective usage of graphics . ( The complete figures are given in Ap - pendix A2 . ) These percentages could be used to rank the issues but the resultant ranking would re - quire careful interpretation . The substantial judge - ment required to define the issue boundaries makes these percentages a function of the researchers ' categorization as well as of the respondents ' preferences . This cautionary note is supported by the substantial changes that oc - curred between the first and second round rank - ings . These changes provide justification for the multiple survey rounds of the Delphi approach . The ranking was used in the second round to order the issues for presentation . Participants were not given the percentages , nor were they told that the issues had been ordered in any par - ticular way . In the second round participants were invited to make comments about the issues and rationales on the list . This was done for two reasons . First , the second round survey forms were sent to all of the sample of SIM institutional members and 140 MIS Quarterly / September 1984 This content downloaded from 129 . 120 . 17 . 7 on Sat , 14 Dec 2013 15 : 27 : 59 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Information Systems Issues academics not only to those who responded to the first round . This larger mailing was done to in - crease the number of participants in the survey . The request for comments was an opportunity for the new respondents to contribute to the iden - tification of issues and rationales . Secondly , this solicitation provided feedback to the researchers on their categorization and summarization of issues . About 15 % of the 102 responses to the second round had comments . These suggestions were carefully reviewed and resulted in some minor changes to the wording of the issues and rationales . ( All statements of issues and rationales in this article incorporate those changes . ) Many of the comments were concerned with the overlap of issues . The problem faced by the researchers was to create a reasonably short list that was still specific enough to be meaningful . As there was no consensus among respondent recommendations for combining or dividing issues , they were left as they were . Participants in subsequent rounds were asked to rank the issues on their central aspects . For example , the issue concerning the integration of data proces - sing office automation , and telecommunications is focussing on the integration aspect . Issues specific to office automation are related and im - portant , but not part of this key issue . Selecting and Ranking the Issues For rounds two , three , and four of the survey , respondents were asked to select the ten most important issues on the list and to rank them ac - cordingly . Participants were to assign the most important issue a score of 10 , the second most important 9 , and so on down to 1 . Issues that were not in the top ten were given a 0 or left blank . If left blank , the researchers later assigned them a 0 for analysis purposes . The number of responses to the ranking survey declined from a high of 1 02 in the second round to the 54 who finished the final round . The latter group ( N = 54 ) is the basis of the final issue rank - ing . As such , this group ' s data was selected for the principal analyses in this paper . Unless other - wise stated , the data and conclusions refer to the N = 54 group . The final results section discusses differences between the N = 54 group and the larger group . Percentage Ranking The final round percentages of respondents who selected each issue as one of their top ten is given in Table 2 . A complete listing for all the rounds is given n Appendix A2 . Note that in the last round both improving IS planning and facilita - tion and management of end user computing were named by all respondents as a key issue . Figure 1 graphically shows the changes in percentages of the eleven top - rated issue for each of the four rounds of the study . The greatest change in percentages occurred between the first round ( the percent mentioned ) and the sec - ond round ( the percent included ) . In the remain - ing iterations , all of the percentages gradually moved upward except for the eleventh one ( the portfolio issue ) ; which decreased until it was only half of the next higher issue . Mean Score Ranking The primary method of establishing the group ranking for this study was the average rank scores . The highest mean rank score for each round was ranked first , the second highest , sec - ond , and so on . Table 2 contains the mean rank scores , their standard deviations , and the rank - ings for the final ( N = 54 ) group for the last round . Appendix A3 gives these values for all three rounds as well as the values of the larger N = 102 ( second round ) and N = 62 ( third round ) groups . The ranking that resulted from the fourth round was used to define the final mean ranking that established the final ordering of issues for these discussions . The top ten from this ranking in - cluded eleven issues because there was a tie for tenth place between development and implemen - tation of decision support systems and planning and management of the applications portfolio . Figure 2 ( left side ) shows graphically how the mean rank scores changed over the three ranking rounds . The results of the fourth round are com - pared to the rank scores that the issues would have achieved had there been perfect agreement among the participants . Note that average rank scores moved consistently toward these perfect scores indicating an increasing agreement about the ranking of the issues . Median Score Ranking The rank scores contributed by the respondents were required to be whole numbers and all ten ranks had to be assigned . This approach does not allow a participant to say , for example , that the MIS Quarterly / September 1984 141 This content downloaded from 129 . 120 . 17 . 7 on Sat , 14 Dec 2013 15 : 27 : 59 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Figure 1 .

S . S . Stevens [ 7 ] and others have argued that means and standard deviations are not appropriate statistics for this kind of measurement ( i . e . , one that uses an or - dinal scale ) . Medians and interquartile ranges are more suitable measures of central tendency and variance , respectively . Medians also provide the advantage of not being as affected by extreme values as arithmetic means . An analysis was done to see if using median rank scores changed the final issue ranking . Table 1 shows the median rank scores and the quartile rank scores for the last round of the final ( N = 54 ) group . Appendix A4 gives these values and their associated ranks for all three rounds . Note that in the final round the same issues that made up the mean rank score top ten are includ - ed in the median rank score top ten , with one ex - ception - the tied portfolio issue . The order also has not changed , except that there is now a tie for third and eighth places . The major apparent dif - ference in using the median scores for rankings is the increase in the number of ties . Figure 2 ( right side ) shows the changes in median scores of the top ten issues over the three final rounds . Like the percentages and mean scores , they ap - pear to be moving toward the perfect agreement scores . The lower median ranking , and especially the lower percentage of inclusion , suggested that planning and management of the applications portfolio could be dropped from the key issues list . The tie for the tenth position in the mean score ranking appears to be due to a few high ranks rather than to a general consensus opinion . Movement Toward Consensus Some evidence of a movement toward consen - sus has already been presented . Figure 1 shows increasing agreement about which issues to in - clude in the group ' s top ten . The tenth issue , for example , concerning decision support systems went from only 21 % of respondents mentioning it in the first round to almost 63 % including it on their lists in the fourth round . The group reached perfect agreement about the inclusion of the IS planning and end user computing issues . The changes in the mean rank scores and the median rank scores illustrated in Figure 2 are also indica - tions of movement toward consensus . From the second through the fourth rounds the means and medians moved toward their perfect consensus scores . Some of the median rank scores exactly equaled their perfect scores . The measures of central tendency ( means and medians ) and the percentages can tell only so much about ranking agreement . To find out more we must examine measures of dispersion for the rank scores . Two measures were examined : ( 1 ) standard deviations , and ( 2 ) interquartile ranges . These measures provide a more precise way to measure rank score consensus . The standard deviation of the rank scores is related to the average of the differences between participants ' scores and the group ' s average score . A decreasing standard deviation indicates a decrease in these differences , i . e . , more consen - sus . If there was perfect consensus , the standard deviation would be 0 . Figure 3 ( left side ) shows the movement of standard deviations toward 0 , the perfect consensus value . The figure suggests that most agreement was about the rank score for improved IS planning and the least agreement was about the rank position of measuring and im - proving IS effectiveness / productivity . The second measure of dispersion is the inter - quartile range . This range is the difference be - tween the third quartile ( 3Q ) rank score and the first quartile ( 1Q ) rank score . For example , the fourth round third quartile rank score for the im - proved IS planning issue is 10 . Its first quartile score is 9 . The interquartile range is therefore 1 ( 10 minus 9 ) . Perfect consensus is an interquar - tile range of 0 . Figure 3 ( right side ) illustrates the movement of the interquartile ranges over the three ranking rounds . As with the standard devia - tions , there is a movement toward perfect con - sensus . Again , in the final round there was most agreement about the ranking of improved IS plan - ning and the least about measuring and improving IS effectiveness / productivity . Substantial consensus was achieved concerning most of the issue ranks . This consensus grew over the course of the Delphi rounds . It should not be assumed , however , that further rounds would lead to more consensus . Perfect consensus would probably never be achieved . Even if con - sensus improvement could be obtained with more survey rounds the authors are not convinced that it would be worth the effort .

Whole Group vs Final Group The preceding analysis and discussion is based on the group that completed all of the ranking rounds , i . e . , the N = 54 group . The authors believe that this is the appropriate group for analysis because it eliminates changes in rankings that are due solely to participants dropping out of the study . The larger groups , however , still played a part in the study . It was the ranking of issues based on the larger groups ' mean scores that determined the order of presentation of the , f0 / / 5 / 6 , - _ < D : ( - _ e ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ bF 6 Mean Ranks issues and rationales in the next round . It was also this ranking that was the basis for feedback to the respondents on how they compared with the groups ' ranking . Therefore , it is worthwhile to briefly examine the larger groups ' data . Appendix A5 contains the ranks , means , and stan - dard deviations for the second and third rounds of the study for both the N = 54 group and the larger two groups . There were very few differences . In the second round the N = 102 group had in - cluded the data resource issue in its top ten , while the smaller group did not . It also excluded the of - fice automation issue which the N = 54 group had placed in ninth position . Overall , the mean paired 144 MIS Quarterly / September 1984 Final Mean Rank This content downloaded from 129 . 120 . 17 . 7 on Sat , 14 Dec 2013 15 : 27 : 59 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Fourth Round Perfect Consensus 10 Median Ranks difference between group rank scores is zero ( 0 . 00 ) and the standard deviation is 0 . 32 . The third round brought with it a substantial reduction in the number of participants . The 62 who remained ranked the issues almost exactly as the N = 54 group did . Their top ten issues were the same . This would be expected since the 54 participants in the final round made up the great majority of the third round sample . The mean paired difference between group rank scores is 0 . 005 with a standard deviation of 0 . 143 . The authors do not believe that these small differences adversely affect the results of the study . Concluding Remarks The determination of a group of key management issues by an influential segment of the information systems community is an important contribution . It fills a need for individuals and organizations making decision about research , curriculum , pro - fessional programs , and business activities . The Delphi approach used to determine the issue ranking provides some degree of confidence that an actual consensus of views was captured . This new use of the Delphi technique can also be con - sidered a contribution . Its success here may point to other possible uses in information systems research .
