Keywords Endocytosis · Membrane trafficking · Endothelial cells · Neuroscience Introduction to the cellular architecture of the blood – brain barrier The blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) is a highly selective interface between the systemic circulation and the brain parenchyma which is required for brain homeostasis and protection of the sensible neuronal environment . Electron microscopy studies in the 1960s localized the BBB to the brain vas - culature and concluded that a barrier between blood and brain parenchyma is maintained by intercellular tight junc - tions and reduced vesicular trafficking , which limit paracel - lular and transcellular transport , respectively [ 1 ] . A crucial requirement for the functionality of the BBB is the intensive cross - talk between brain endothelial cells ( BECs ) , pericytes and astrocytes , which together with the extracellular matrix form the neuro - vascular unit ( NVU ) [ 2 ] . Pericytes cover 60 – 70 % of the abluminal endothelial surface , whereas astro - cyte endfeet reach almost 100 % , overlaying pericytes [ 3 – 5 ] . Pericytes surround the endothelial walls of capillaries and post - capillary venules and regulate the BBB by pro - moting the formation of tight junctions and reducing vesi - cle trafficking in endothelial cells [ 6 ] . It was proposed that pericytes can also contribute to the regulation of cerebral blood flow [ 7 ] , but the mechanisms through which pericytes can achieve this function are still unclear [ 8 , 9 ] . Strikingly , a recent study showed that acute laser ablation of single pericytes in mice affected capillary dilation but not BBB permeability [ 10 ] . The endothelial – pericyte interaction is maintained by the basal lamina and regulated at the cel - lular level by a machinery of junction proteins arranged in a characteristic “peg - and - socket” myoendothelial junction . The anatomical relationship and close interactions between pericytes and endothelial cells are important for reciprocal Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences * Roberto Villaseñor roberto . villasenor _ solorio @ roche . com * Ludovic Collin ludovic . collin @ roche . com 1 Roche Pharma Research and Early Development ( pRED ) , Pharmaceutical Sciences , Roche Innovation Center , Basel , Switzerland 2 Institute for Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology , University of Lübeck , Lübeck , Germany 3 DZHK ( German Research Centre for Cardiovascular Research ) , Partner Site Hamburg / Lübeck / Kiel , Germany 4 Roche Pharma Research and Early Development ( pRED ) , Neuro - Immunology , Roche Innovation Center , Basel , Switzerland 1082 R . Villaseñor et al . 1 3 regulation of cell adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation via paracrine and juxtacrine signaling through the PDGF - B / PDGFRβ , angiopoetin / Tie2 , and TGFβ / TGFβR pathways [ 6 ] . Pericyte depletion in mice by genetic mutation of the PDGF - B pathway leads to substantial extravasation of high - molecular substances , including IgG and albumin , due to increased transcellular transport [ 11 , 12 ] . Interestingly , the increased permeability of the BBB triggered by pericyte loss is heterogeneous throughout the brain , with the cortex and the hippocampus significantly more affected than midbrain regions [ 13 ] . These observations suggest that pericyte - inde - pendent signals may regulate BBB permeability . Astrocytes are star - shaped cells attached to penetrat - ing arterial blood vessels and to the outer layer of mature capillaries , where they fulfil supportive functions by main - taining neuronal excitability and homeostasis [ 14 ] . Specifi - cally , astrocyte end - feet ensheath the central nervous system ( CNS ) microvasculature and neuronal synapses and enable the modulation of neuronal activity , BBB formation , and cerebral blood flow . Astrocytes express specialized mole - cules and release growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , and angiopoetin - 1 ( ANG - 1 ) that are essential for the induction of BBB properties . The specific effects of astrocytes on BBB function have been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere [ 15 – 18 ] . It is now accepted that the BBB is not completely imper - meable to large molecules , but that multiple proteins cross the BBB via receptor - mediated transcytosis ( RMT ) . Recep - tors involved in transcytosis across the BBB include insulin receptor , transferrin receptor , and low - density lipoprotein receptor [ 19 ] . Although the extent of protein transcytosis across the BBB is quantitatively lower than in peripheral endothelia , such transport is not negligible , but has instead important physiological roles , as exemplified by insulin [ 20 ] and leptin [ 21 ] . Importantly , RMT has been exploited by molecular shuttles that enhance the delivery of biologics to the brain [ 22 ] . Yet , despite the relevance of RMT for physi - ological processes and therapeutic development , very little is known about its regulation at the cellular and molecular levels [ 19 , 23 , 24 ] . Here , we highlight the most recent find - ings on transcytosis across the BBB and its regulation in physiological and pathophysiological conditions . Intracellular transport pathways across the blood – brain barrier The observations from the landmark electron microscopy study from Reese and Karnovsky [ 1 ] led to the paradigm that minimal vesicular transport is a key property of the BBB [ 25 ] . While the number of vesicles in BECs is indeed lower than the number of vesicles in peripheral endothelial cells ( ECs ) [ 26 ] , by no means is endocytosis negligible at the BBB . On the contrary , electron microscopy studies showed that exogenous horse radish peroxidase ( HRP ) is internalized , albeit only in low amounts , and transported to lysosomes in BECs [ 27 ] . A more recent study also found that endogenous mouse IgG are localized within intracellular vesicles within BECs and transported to lysosomes [ 28 ] . Vesicular transport is especially important for RMT across the BBB , as shown for molecular shuttles that enhance anti - body delivery to the brain [ 29 ] . However , not all internal - ized antibodies undergo efficient transcytosis . For example , it was shown that both high binding affinity and bivalent antibody binding to the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) prevented transcytosis and instead , drove transport to the lysosome [ 30 , 31 ] . The fact that both brain - penetrant ( e . g . , TfR monovalent antibodies ) and non - brain - penetrant molecules ( e . g . , TfR bivalent antibodies , IgG ) are internalized by BECs raise the question to which sorting mechanisms determine suc - cessful transcytosis to the brain parenchyma . In this section , we review the known intracellular endocytic mechanisms in endothelial cells and discuss how such mechanisms can regulate transcytosis across the BBB ( Fig . 1 ) . The transcellular transport pathway is initiated by endo - cytosis at the plasma membrane . For a detailed review on the mechanisms of endocytosis , the reader is referred to recent reviews on the topic [ 32 , 33 ] . The most highly characterized internalization pathway is clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) [ 34 ] . A recent study showed that approximately 95 % of transmembrane receptors at the plasma membrane are internalized via CME in fibroblasts [ 35 ] . Coated pits charac - teristic of CME can be observed in BECs in brain tissue by electron microscopy [ 28 ] . Furthermore , multiple receptors that undergo RMT in BECs require CME for internalization , such as TfR [ 35 , 36 ] and insulin receptor [ 37 ] . Despite the prevalence of CME , other clathrin - independent pathway ( s ) may also regulate RMT across the BBB . In peripheral blood vessels , there is strong evidence for the role of caveolae in transcellular transport . Caveolae are 60 – 80 nm flask - shaped organelles that lack an electron - dense membrane coat and contain oligomeric caveolin - 1 [ 38 ] . It was previously shown that lung endothelial cells in caveolin - 1 deficient mice lack caveolae and exhibit impaired transcytosis of an antibody against aminopepti - dase P [ 39 ] . More recent data showed that caveolin - 1 is also involved in transcytosis across the BBB . Caveolae assembly at the plasma membrane in BECs is negatively regulated by the lipid transporter Mfsd2a [ 40 ] . Genetic knock - out of Mfsd2a in mice led to a marked increase in both brain endothelial caveolae and transcellular perme - ability in the brain vasculature [ 41 ] . Abolishing caveolin - 1 in Mfsd2a knock - out mice prevented enhanced transcyto - sis [ 40 ] . These results revealed that caveolin - 1 is required for the transport of fluid - phase molecules such as dextran 1083 Intracellular transport and regulation of transcytosis across the blood – brain barrier 1 3 and HRP upon Mfsd2a knock - out . Whether caveolin - 1 is required for RMT under physiological conditions was not explored . It is important to note that caveolae also regulate lipid transport , mechanoregulation , and cell signaling [ 42 ] . It is still unclear whether caveolae are endocytic trans - port carriers that undergo transcytosis , or instead , they indirectly induce transcytosis via endosomes , for example , through modulation of membrane fluidity . Interestingly , recent studies have challenged the role of caveolae as endo - cytic transport carriers . First , there is no known specific cargo molecule transported primarily by caveolae [ 42 ] . Second , the widespread methods for cholesterol extraction used to disassemble caveolae , for example , treatment with filipin , also affect other clathrin - independent pathways [ 43 , 44 ] . Finally , knock - out of caveolin - 1 upregulated caveolin - independent pathways in mouse fibroblasts [ 45 ] . Therefore , further work is required to clarify how caveolae regulate intracellular transport and what is their specific contribution to transcytosis at the BBB . Further additional clathrin - independent pathways can drive the internalization of receptors , for example , fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) , macropinocyto - sis , ultrafast endocytosis , and the clathrin - independent carri - ers / glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein - enriched endocytic compartment ( CLIC / GEEC ) pathway [ 32 , 46 ] . However , these pathways have been observed only in non - endothelial cell types , and to date , there is no evidence of their presence in BECs . Caveolae Clathrin - coated pits CIE ?

Transport across brain endothelial cells can be divided into three dis - tinct processes : internalization , sorting , and exocytosis . For simplic - ity , only transport from the luminal ( apical ) to the abluminal ( baso - lateral ) membrane is shown , but the same mechanisms may also occur for basolateral - to - apical trafficking . Internalization into brain endothelial cells can occur via caveolae , clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis , or clathrin - independent endocytosis pathways such as fast endo - philin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) or clathrin - independent carri - ers / glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein - enriched endocytic compartment ( CLIC / GEEC ) . Internalization pathways converge in the early endosome network , which functions as an intracellular sort - ing station . Caveolae are thought to undergo transcytosis without fusion with early endosomes to promote transport of receptor - inde - pendent molecules ( e . g . , HRP , dextran , and albumin ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) fuse with early endosomes after shedding the clath - rin coat . From early endosomes , cargo can be transported via sorting tubules for transcytosis ( e . g . , Monovalent TfR and cation - independ - ent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ( CI - MPR ) antibodies ) . Alterna - tively , endosomes mature into late endosomes and multi - vesicular bodies ( MVB ) which undergo fusion with lysosomes for cargo deg - radation ( e . g . , Bivalent TfR antibody , IgG ) . The retrograde transport pathway can shuttle cargo ( e . g . , CI - MPR antibody ) from lysosomes to the Golgi apparatus and early endosomes . Exocytosis occurs when the sorting / transport compartment fuses with the abluminal membrane and is the least characterized process during endothelial transcytosis . Sorting tubules can fuse directly with the abluminal membrane or they can fuse with an intermediate basolateral sorting endosome ( BSE ) prior to exocytosis , as observed for transcytosis in epithelial cells . From the Golgi , cargo exocytosis can occur directly by polarized secretion to the abluminal membrane or indirectly by transport to early endosomes and subsequent sorting into tubules . A subpopulation of MVBs is thought to promote transcytosis by fusing with the abluminal membrane and releasing cargo ( e . g . , FC5 anti - body ) bound to exosomes . Dotted lines reflect pathways or compart - ments which have not been experimentally verified 1084 R . Villaseñor et al . 1 3 The internalization pathway can determine the cellular fate of a receptor , as was hypothesized for the LDL receptor which is internalized by both CME and caveolin - dependent endocytosis [ 47 ] . However , mechanisms downstream of internalization can also sort receptors to different destina - tions . One of the best examples of such receptors at the BBB is TfR . Two independent groups showed that monovalent antibodies or bispecific low - affinity constructs against TfR are sorted for transcytosis , while bivalent antibodies or high - affinity constructs against TfR are sorted for degradation at lysosomes [ 30 , 31 ] . A recent study described that differential sorting of this receptor - antibody pair is regulated by intra - cellular tubules [ 48 ] . Transport via tubules is an efficient and versatile strategy to sort proteins to different intracel - lular destinations , as it allows separating receptors based on interactions with cytosolic proteins [ 49 , 50 ] or on the balance between receptor monomers and oligomers [ 51 ] . In the case of TfR in BECs , bivalent antibody binding resulted in the formation of macroscopic receptor clusters which failed to enter intracellular tubules [ 48 ] . Although tubules were observed both in primary mouse BECs and in mouse brain capillaries in vivo , their molecular identity was not characterized . Work in other cell types showed that endoso - mal tubules are heterogeneous organelles that can be formed through different membrane - remodeling pathways , includ - ing sorting nexins containing the Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs domain ( SNX - BAR ) , Arf6 GAP proteins with coiled - coil , ankyrin repeats and pleckstrin homology domain ( ACAPs ) and Eps15 homology domain ( EHD ) proteins [ 52 ] . There - fore , a systematic loss - of - function approach will be required to identify the mechanisms that drive tubule formation and receptor sorting at the BBB . Sorting by intracellular tubules is likely not exclusive to TfR transcytosis , but could be a general mechanism of trans - port at the BBB , as suggested by studies on the cation - inde - pendent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ( CI - MPR ) . CI - MPR is shuttled by the retrograde transport pathway between the trans - Golgi network and endosomes to deliver lysosomal hydrolases [ 53 ] . It was recently found that BECs of porcine and bovine origin express CI - MPR and that this receptor is able to undergo bidirectional apico - basal trafficking across polarized BECs [ 54 ] . Interestingly , recent work in HeLa cells showed that CI - MPR transport from endosomes occurs via intracellular tubules formed by the SNX1 / 2 - 5 / 6 com - plexes [ 55 ] . Whether SNX - dependent tubules are responsi - ble for the sorting and apico - basal trafficking of CI - MPR and transcytosis of TfR at the BBB still needs to be investigated . Additional evidence supporting the relevance of intracel - lular sorting for transcytosis across the BBB comes from the extensive characterization of the novel camelid antibody construct FC5 . FC5 crosses the BBB via RMT driven by the putative receptor Tmem30 [ 56 , 57 ] . By performing multi - plexed mass spectrometry on purified organelle fractions from an immortalized rat BEC cell line , it was shown that FC5 was enriched in early endosomes and a subpopula - tion of multi - vesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . On the other hand , a construct that does not undergo transcytosis in vivo was enriched in late endosomes / lysosomes and depleted from early endosomes [ 58 ] . These observations strengthen the hypothesis that the lysosomal network is an additional mechanism to restrict transcellular transport of blood - borne proteins [ 27 , 28 ] . The authors of this study [ 58 ] proposed a new pathway for FC5 transcytosis which could be mediated by MVB fusion with the plasma membrane , as known to occur during exosome biogenesis [ 59 ] . The last step during transcellular transport at the BBB is exocytosis , which refers to the fusion of the carrier organelle with the opposite membrane . It is still unknown whether tubules and / or MVBs directly undergo fusion with the abluminal or luminal membrane . An alternative scenario is that tubules and / or MVBs may act as transport intermedi - ates between apical and basolateral endosomes , as observed in epithelial cells [ 60 ] . Recently , an assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy was developed to better characterize insulin and LDL transcy - tosis in endothelial cells [ 61 ] . The application of this or other similar novel quantitative approaches to BECs will be instrumental to shed light on the mechanisms regulating exocytosis at the BBB . Although most studies have focused on apical - to - basolateral BBB transport ( i . e . , influx to the brain parenchyma ) , trafficking from the basolateral to apical membrane ( i . e . , efflux from the brain parenchyma ) is very likely occurring within BECs . Recent work suggested that basolateral - to - apical transport of LRP1 receptor may play an important role for efflux and clearance of amyloid β ( Aβ ) [ 62 ] . However , data on this pathway on BECs are scarce and it is still unclear whether the same mechanisms regulating apical - to - basolateral transport also operate in the opposite direction . Transcellular transport across the BBB is currently being exploited to enhance delivery of therapeutic antibodies to the brain . Utilizing the TfR pathway as a shuttle mechanism has proved to be a successful strategy for brain delivery in preclinical species [ 30 , 63 ] . Key lessons from these studies were that the extent of transport to the brain parenchyma is regulated by TfR - antibody avidity and affinity . These results were recently confirmed using TfR - targeted nanoparticles [ 64 ] . Interestingly , the effects of avidity and affinity on transport were not observed when different antibody for - mats against TfR [ 65 ] or antibodies against another receptor [ 57 ] were used as shuttles . These findings underscore the fact that transport across the BBB is not solely dependent on antibody binding properties , but is likely receptor - and epitope - specific . Recently , a proteomic analysis of mouse brain endothelial cells was performed to identify novel BBB - specific membrane proteins and increase the repertoire of 1085 Intracellular transport and regulation of transcytosis across the blood – brain barrier 1 3 transcytosis shuttles . This work identified that the trans - membrane proteins CD98hc and Glut1 are highly enriched in brain capillaries [ 66 ] . Antibodies against CD98hc sub - stantially increased transport across the BBB in mice after systemic dosing . However , it should be noted that although CD98hc - and TfR - based shuttles can enhance transport of biologics to the brain in preclinical species , the safety , effi - cacy , and pharmacokinetic profiles of these molecules are likely impacted by the ubiquitous expression of TfR and CD98hc in peripheral tissues . An alternative approach to discover brain - specific shuttles is to screen antibody or peptide libraries for molecules that can cross the BBB in preclinical species . With this method , two different groups identified new binders with enhanced brain penetration after systemic dosing [ 67 , 68 ] . While promising , these novel shut - tles rely on poorly characterized receptors ( e . g . , CD98hc , Tmem30 ) with unknown intracellular transport routes . As discussed below , we consider that optimization of new shut - tles will require a thorough characterization of their intra - cellular transport pathways . While more work is required for a better understanding of how receptors can cross the BBB , the studies summarized in this section highlight the relevance of intracellular trafficking for transcytosis as well as its potential to be exploited as a delivery mechanism of therapeutic antibodies . In the next section , we discuss how intracellular transport at the BBB is affected during disease . Regulation of intracellular transport across the BBB during disease Sterile brain injuries ( e . g . , status epilepticus , non - penetrating trauma , and vascular accident ) and chronic stages of diverse brain diseases are often associated with capillary damage and increased BBB permeability [ 69 , 70 ] . The inflamma - tory response that accompanies the progression of numerous CNS disorders promotes an aberrant neuro - vascular remod - eling resulting in neuronal dysfunction and neurodegenera - tion [ 71 – 73 ] . There is ample evidence to demonstrate that inflammation opens tight junctions and enhances paracellu - lar transport , which has been reviewed elsewhere [ 2 ] . Here , we focus on the specific changes to intracellular transport across the BBB . In particular , numerous electron micros - copy ( EM ) studies have found an increase in the density of intracellular vesicles in BECs after various forms of injury to the BBB [ reviewed in 74 ] . Such vesicles are partly elon - gated , form vesiculo - tubular structures , and reflect changes in the intracellular endocytic network within BECs . A high number of vesicles and vesiculo - tubular structures is often assumed to reflect an increase in transcytosis rate . How - ever , this conclusion is based on correlative evidence and requires functional validation , as it offers no insight into the transport of cargo molecules . To overcome this limitation , an alternative method was recently developed to investigate the intracellular distribution of endogenous and exogenous cargo molecules at the BBB [ 28 ] . The authors used high - res - olution ex vivo confocal microscopy to detect intracellular accumulation of endogenous IgG within vesicles in mouse BECs . Strikingly , increased BBB permeability led to a sig - nificant reduction in the number of IgG - positive vesicles , likely due to increased fusion with the abluminal membrane and accelerated IgG delivery to the brain parenchyma . This sensitive method will facilitate the functional characteriza - tion of intracellular transport at the BBB during brain injury or disease . Below , we highlight recent examples of intracel - lular transport mis - regulation and its potential consequences in CNS disorders . In the context of Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) , transcytosis across the BBB is increasingly investigated , as it is one of the mechanisms responsible for both clearance of Aβ from the brain and for delivery of therapeutic antibodies to the brain . Genome - wide association studies have linked the disease to several genes that may be involved in Aβ clear - ance [ 75 ] . Interestingly , at least two of them , PICALM and CD2AP , are expressed in BECs and are involved in endo - cytosis [ 62 , 76 ] . The function of PICALM in Aβ transport has been studied in considerable detail . PICALM is a ubiq - uitously expressed clathrin adaptor protein which closely interacts with LRP1 , a key player in receptor - mediated endo - cytosis and Aβ efflux from the brain [ 77 , 78 ] . After binding to LRP1 in an Aβ - dependent manner , PICALM facilitates trafficking to Rab5 - and EEA1 - positive early endosomes and to Rab11 - positive recycling endosomes [ 62 ] . A single - nucle - otide polymorphism in the Picalm locus that leads to a lower Picalm expression is associated with AD , in agreement with the concept that PICALM is involved in the transendothelial transport and efflux of Aβ [ 62 ] . In addition to disturbed PICALM - mediated transcytotic efflux of Aβ , there is also evidence that transcytotic influx of plasma proteins into the brain is enhanced in AD and may contribute to disease pathology [ reviewed in 79 ] . It was proposed that Aβ can induce apoptotic cell death of pericytes in the hippocampus leading to vascular regres - sion , reduction of nutrient transport and energy substrates to neurons , as well as extravasation of blood components in the brain parenchyma . The combination of these multiple factors thus contributes to neuroinflammation and neuronal injury , altogether promoting neurodegeneration [ 73 , 80 , 81 ] . However , the extent of transcytosis during AD seems to be markedly lower than in neuroinflammatory diseases and the specific changes to intracellular transport pathways are still unknown . Interestingly , in mouse models of AD , endogenous plasma proteins as well as exogenously admin - istered therapeutic antibodies were transported to the brain parenchyma , but there was no evidence for a widespread disruption of the BBB [ 79 , 82 , 83 ] . This result suggests that 1086 R . Villaseñor et al . 1 3 the BBB is a hurdle for therapeutic antibodies in AD unless other features increase passage . In stroke patients , EM also identified an increase of vesic - ulo - tubular structures within BECs [ 84 ] . Cerebral ischemia leads to an upregulation of caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 2 in BECs but not in other cell types of the brain [ 85 ] . As early as 6 h after ischemia , there was an increase in endothelial caveolae and albumin uptake / transport to the brain paren - chyma [ 86 ] . In accordance with the key role of caveolin - 1 in caveolae formation , caveolin - 1 deficient mice exhibited reduced albumin uptake / transport to the brain parenchyma in the first hours after stroke . At later timepoints , the BBB was disrupted due to disturbed tight junctions , but this process did not depend on caveolin - 1 [ 86 ] . The relevance of altered intracellular transport for the post - ischemic BBB disruption is supported by data showing a parallel increase of uncoated vesicles and BBB disruption in obese mice [ 87 ] . Hyperten - sion but not old age further increased the number of post - ischemic endothelial vesicles [ 88 , 89 ] . The mechanisms by which obesity or hypertension promote post - ischemic tran - scytosis are still unclear . In addition to the general increase in intracellular transport , cerebral ischemia may exert very specific effects on the machinery involved in RMT , as illus - trated by the upregulation of TfR [ 90 ] , which may enable the efficient delivery of therapeutic antibodies via this pathway . Altered intracellular transport was also observed for multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patients . The number of intracel - lular vesicles within BECs correlated with disease severity [ 91 ] . Interestingly , while there was a substantial increase in non - coated intracellular vesicles between patients , no differ - ences in the number of coated vesicles was detected , sug - gesting that different endocytic pathways are independently regulated . The findings on increased intracellular vesicles are reproduced in the experimental autoimmune encepha - lomyelitis ( EAE ) animal model of MS [ 92 ] . Caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 2 levels are elevated in endothelial cells dur - ing EAE [ 93 , 94 ] , possibly because the pro - inflammatory transcription factor NF - κB controls expression of caveolin - 1 [ 95 ] . In addition , inflammatory cytokines likely present in MS lesions are also known to stimulate fluid - phase endocy - tosis [ 96 – 98 ] . In contrast , Wnt signaling inhibits caveolin - 1 expression , an effect that may contribute to the central role of Wnt in the development and maintenance of the BBB [ 99 ] . Similar to its effect in stroke models , deficiency of caveolin - 1 significantly mitigated the course of EAE [ 93 , 100 ] and reduced the albumin uptake by endothelial cells [ 100 ] . However , the latter effect was lost if mice were matched for the EAE severity score . As discussed in the previous section , this observation could be explained by the upregulation of caveolin - independent endocytosis upon caveolae disassembly . Interestingly , caveolin - 1 deficiency reduced clinical severity in the EAE model of MS by pre - venting transcellular migration of Th1 lymphocytes to the CNS [ 93 , 100 ] . Caveolae are rich in VCAM - 1 that binds to integrins on the surface of Th1 cells , suggesting the intrigu - ing possibility that Th1 cells use the endosomal network as a route for their transcellular migration across the BBB . The changes in BBB permeability observed during injury or disease are mediated by different cell types . Microglial cells , the resident macrophages in the CNS , are the primary cellular regulators of the inflammatory response in the brain [ 101 , 102 ] . Upon brain injury , microglia synthesize a pleth - ora of pro - inflammatory cytokines which can directly affect BBB permeability [ 103 ] . A more general description of the key roles of microglia during injury and disease and their general effect on BBB permeability is out of the scope of this review , but has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [ 101 – 103 ] . Altered BBB permeability during disease can also be mediated by pericytes and astrocytes , as these cells display immune properties and participate in both innate and adaptative immunity processes in vivo [ 104 ] . Changes of the pericyte inflammatory profiles have been reported in CNS pathologies associated with ischemic stroke [ 105 ] , AD [ 81 , 106 ] , and traumatic brain injury [ 107 ] . For exam - ple , pericytes can release matrix metalloproteinases ( e . g . , MMP9 ) upon TNF - α stimulation impacting the integrity of the BBB . Pericytes constitutively express major histocom - patibility complex ( MHC ) class I but not MHC class II or the co - stimulatory molecules CD80 or CD86 . In vivo , they can secrete chemokines and cytokines and attract immune cells to the site of inflammation in the presence of inflammatory cytokines including IFN - γ , IL - 17 , TNF - α , and IL - 1β [ 104 ] . In the case of astrocyte - mediated regulation , the arachidonic acid ( AA ) pathway emerged recently as a regulator of neuro - vascular coupling at the capillary level [ 108 ] . This pathway depends on astrocytic Ca 2 + signaling and the production of AA - derived prostaglandins ( PGs ) [ 109 ] . The AA pathway has also been involved in the regulation of pericyte tone and diameter , which is indicative of its importance for the regu - lation of the neuro - vascular unit [ 6 ] . In astrocytes , produc - tion of the pro - inflammatory PGs depends on the activity of the diacylglycerol lipase ( DAGL ) and the monoacylglycerol lipase ( MAGL ) [ 108 , 110 , 111 ] . In the brain , MAGL is the main enzyme responsible for the production of AA and PGs through the cleavage of the main endocannabinoid 2 - AG . Specific deletion of MAGL expression in astrocytes signifi - cantly increases 2 - AG levels while concomitantly reducing AA levels and protecting against neuroinflammation [ 110 , 111 ] . Inflammation drives the activation of the neurovas - culature , thus disrupting the integrity of the BBB and sub - stantially inducing its permeability as reported in several neurodegenerative diseases . Inhibition of MAGL activity , and , therefore , modulation of PGs expression were recently shown to prevent an inflammation - driven increase in BBB permeability [ 112 ] suggesting a dual role of the AA path - way controlling neuro - vascular coupling and BBB integrity / 1087 Intracellular transport and regulation of transcytosis across the blood – brain barrier 1 3 permeability . However , it should be stressed that changes to the BBB upon immune challenges are not restricted to intra - cellular transport but also affect paracellular transport and immune cell transmigration . Therefore , additional work is required to identify the signaling pathways that specifically mediate changes to the endosomal network during disease . Nonetheless , the examples summarized here provide some evidence that alterations to intracellular transport at the BBB may play a key role in the pathophysiology of CNS disorders . Open questions and challenges The recent findings on intracellular transport across the BBB raise new important questions . How many pathways can drive transcytosis ( e . g . , tubules from early endosomes , MVBs , retrograde transport , caveolae ) ? What is the rela - tive contribution of each pathway to overall transport into and out of the brain ? What mechanisms determine which pathway ( s ) will sort different receptors ? How do these pro - cesses contribute or respond to disease ? Answering these questions first requires identifying the molecular mecha - nisms controlling intracellular transport at the BBB . Such mechanisms may be unique to endothelial cells , as BECs do not express known regulators of epithelial transcytosis , such as Rab17 and Rab25 [ 48 ] . We consider that to improve the current understanding of BBB transcytosis and reveal the specific mechanisms of intracellular transport within BECs , it is necessary to adopt emerging technologies from the field of molecular cell biology , such as super - resolution microscopy , unbiased image analysis , and genome editing . The value of quantitative microscopy / image analysis for the BBB is highlighted by the findings on new mechanisms of transferrin receptor sorting [ 48 ] and on the regulation of the endo - lysosomal network of porcine BECs by astrocytes [ 113 ] . However , a major limitation of these studies is that they relied on two - dimensional cellular models that do not fully recapitulate the complex cellular architecture of the NVU . Moreover , most studies on the BBB use animal mod - els which may not be translatable to human physiology . A solution to these caveats may come from the use of increas - ingly complex in vitro human BBB models , including mul - ticellular human BBB spheroids [ 114 ] , inducible pluripo - tent stem - cell - derived multicellular co - cultures [ 115 , 116 ] , and microphysiological systems with fluid flow [ 117 ] . The study of such complex models requires the adoption of new imaging technologies [ 118 ] that allow the acquisition of the complete NVU volume with subcellular resolution at endo - cytosis - relevant time scales . The combination of improved multicellular BBB models with advanced microscopy imag - ing will likely reveal physiologically relevant mechanisms for the regulation of intracellular transport across the BBB . We propose that a better understanding of intracellular transport within BECs will lead to improved therapies for CNS disorders , specifically through the impact in three key areas of drug development . First , a thorough characteri - zation of transcytosis across the BBB and its alterations during disease can point to new therapeutic targets . For example , upregulation of wild - type PICALM in BECs may help decrease Aβ levels in AD . Second , detailed knowl - edge on the regulation of intracellular transport will con - tribute to rational design of antibody shuttles . Current shuttle engineering focuses mostly on modifying binding properties , but as discussed above , target binding does not always correlate with transport across the BBB . By map - ping which intracellular routes are most efficient for tran - scytosis , shuttles with desired trafficking profiles could be engineered , for example , by modifying net protein charge [ 119 ] or by adding glycosphingolipids that regulate sort - ing [ 120 ] . Third , understanding the itinerary of proteins within BECs will improve target receptor selection and molecule optimization . Selection criteria are now primar - ily based on receptor expression and specificity . However , abundant receptors in BECs are not necessarily the most efficient for transcytosis , as is the case for TfR [ 121 ] . During molecule optimization , another critical factor to consider is the interaction between a given shuttle and other endosome - resident proteins in the same pathway . For example , it is not yet known whether FcRn , an endosome - resident receptor expressed in BECs which specializes in recycling antibodies back to the circulation [ 122 ] , impacts transcytosis of TfR - antibody - based shuttles . Furthermore , the development of new antibody formats using , for exam - ple , pH - sensitive linkers [ 123 ] or sequential targeting to promote binding at the cell surface followed by intracellu - lar redirection [ 29 ] , clearly require a detailed understand - ing of sorting pathways and protein interactions within endosomes . Through the impact on these three areas , we consider that investigating the mechanisms of intracellular pathways at the BBB will help to accelerate the clinical development of new brain delivery platforms for biologics . The evidence on intracellular transport across the BBB presented in this review demonstrate that , instead of being cells with “reduced vesicular transport” , BECs possess a complex intracellular transport network controlling recep - tor transport to the brain . Characterizing these pathways will help drive a renaissance in the field of intracellular transport across the BBB .
