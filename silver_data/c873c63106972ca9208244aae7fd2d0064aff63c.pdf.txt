In the face of climate change , more research is needed to understand how animals adjust to dynamic ecosystems . Seasonal environments offer a unique opportunity to observe how animals use the landscape in a fluctuating system . The antelope jackrabbit ( Lepus alleni ) is an understudied lagomorph found in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona , USA and Mexico . Basic ecological information on this species is lacking beyond historical responses to rangeland conditions . Using radio telemetry , we collected data on home range size and seasonal ranges of antelope jackrabbits on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in southcentral Arizona . Male and female antelope jackrabbit mean home range size differed slightly , though not significantly . Within a seasonal landscape of semidesert and Sonoran savanna grasslands , antelope jackrabbits seasonal range size did not change but the home range usage percentage differed across seasons and degree of interseason similarity was low . Antelope jackrabbit home ranges are comparable to range sizes reported for the widespread black - tailed jackrabbit ( Lepus californicus ) as well as the closely related Tehuantepec jackrabbit ( Lepus flavigularis ) . This study is the first to document antelope jackrabbit home range , and our results permit a better understanding of how these hares use the landscape in a complex arid environment . Key words : Arizona , hare , lagomorph , seasonality , spatial ecology . The Sonoran Desert is North America’s hottest desert and is currently affected by climate change , with warmer temperatures and fewer freeze events in recent times ( Weiss and Overpeck 2005 ) . The Desert Southwest of southern Arizona , USA , experiences drawn - out winter rains , followed by dry and hot summers , punctuated by intense late - summer monsoons ( Phillips and Comus 2000 ) . Native wildlife species are well - adapted for the extreme conditions of desert ecosystems ( Evenari et al . 1971 ; Stafford Smith and Morton 1990 ; Morton et al . 2011 ) . Appropriate responses by wildlife to cyclic changes in resources include altering dietary choices ( Hofmann 1989 ) or seasonal variations in home range size ( Burt 1943 ) . A fundamental aspect of species ecology in a seasonal landscape is the temporal stability of the individual home range . An animal’s home range is the area that an animal maintains throughout life while searching for food , mates , and raising young ( Burt 1943 ) . Within an individual home range , the core area is considered the space where most activities are focused ( Samuel et al . 1985 ; Samuel and Garton 1987 ) . Home range dynamics of multiple individ - uals provide a wealth of information regarding the social and mating systems ( Greenwood 1980 ; Damuth 1981 ; Parker and Waite 1997 ; Cooper and Randall 2007 ) . Additionally , home range size of mammals , including lagomorphs , is often a reflection of resource quality ( e . g . , Hixon 1980 ; Powers and McKee 1994 ; Powell 2000 ) . Examining how animals use the landscape not only improves our knowledge of species’ ecology , but can also inform us about resource availability and habitat quality ( Ford 1983 ) . For example , hare home range size varies due to differences in habitat cover , resources , and water availability ( Lechleitner 1958 ; Smith 1990 ; Flinders and Chapman 2003 ) . Among Lepus species , home range sizes vary intraspecifically depending on location ( Table 1 ; Kunst et al . 2001 ; Rühe and Hohmann 2004 ) . Variation * To whom correspondence should be addressed . E - mail : maltemus @ live . com 122 Mammal Study 44 ( 2019 ) in resource availability and quality has likely led to a wide range of home range estimates in the black - tailed jackrabbit ( Lepus californicus ; Table 1 ) . In highly sea - sonal environments , animals shift home ranges and move in response to fluctuating environmental conditions ( Ferguson et al . 1999 ) . For example , the grassland desert - inhabiting Tehuantepec jackrabbit ( L . flavigularis ) shows seasonal variation in home range size ( Carrillo - Reyes et al . 2010 ) . Home range estimates and seasonal movement patterns for the desert - dwelling antelope jackrabbit ( L . alleni ) have not been examined . The antelope jackrabbit is a conspicuous , but under - studied Sonoran Savanna mammal ( Hoffmeister 1986 ; Brown et al . 2018 ) . Antelope jackrabbits are closely re - lated to other white - sided species such as the white - tailed jackrabbits ( L . townsendii ) , the white - sided jackrabbit ( L . callotis ) , and the Tehuantepec jackrabbit ( Brown et al . 2018 ) . This species can be found in Arizona and northwestern Mexico , occurring sympatrically with black - tailed jackrabbits , with adults weighing between 2 . 5 – 4 kg ( Brown et al . 2018 ) . Knowledge of the species is limited to life history characteristics in relation to cattle grazing in southern Arizona ( Vorhies and Taylor 1933 ) , population dynamics in response to precipitation ( Madsen 1974 ; Gray 1977 ) , forage consumption ( Arnold 1942 ) , and physiology ( Dawson and Schmidt - Nielsen 1966 ; Hinds 1977 ) . Data on basic ecological traits like home range size , seasonal landscape use , and habitat preferences are unknown . Interest in the antelope jackrabbit’s role in the ecosys - tem has been revitalized by recent literature reviews and observational surveys ( Brown et al . 2014 ; Lorenzo et al . 2014 ) , but systematic field studies remain lacking . Our study is the first to examine antelope jackrabbit spatial ecology in the semidesert grassland of the Sonoran Desert . Our objectives were to determine home range size and assess whether antelope jackrabbits respond to the seasonably variable environment in an expected manner . Given the seasonality of the Desert Southwest , we would expect antelope jackrabbit home range to fluctuate based upon resource availability and quality . Methods Study area This study was conducted on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge ( 31 . 5501°N , 111 . 5507°W ; BANWR ) , in Pima County in southcentral Arizona , 90 km southwest of Tucson , Arizona . BANWR encompasses 46 450 ha in the Altar Valley basin . The U . S . - Mexico international border is the southern boundary of BANWR , with the Baboquivari Mountains to the west and the Sierrita Mountains to the east . BANWR is bisected by the east - west Arivaca Road , which creates a northern site and Table 1 .

Elevation ranges between 925 to 1400 m ( Koenen and Krausman 2002 ) , however most of the refuge occurs within 950 to 1150 m ( McLaughlin 1992 ) . BANWR is comprised mainly of a semidesert grassland and Sonoran desertscrub , with relict subtropical savanna grassland ( Brown 1994 ) . Exotic grasses ( Eragrostis chloromelas , Eragrostis lehmanniana , Sorghum halepense ) , shrubs ( Ambrosia dumosa , Baccharis sarothroides , Gutierrezia sarothrae ) , native grasses ( Aristida hamulosa , Aristida ternipes , Bouteloua rothrocku , Bouteloua repens , Digitaria californica ) , a variety of cactus species ( Carnegiea gigantea , Echinocereus fasciculatus , Opuntia spp . ) and velvet mesquite ( Prosopis velutina ) stands can be found on the refuge ( McLaughlin 1992 ; Brown 1994 ) . BANWR receives an average of 410 mm annual precipi - tation ( Sellers et al . 1985 ) , with monsoon rains occurring in July and August and winter rains occurring between December and March ( McLaughlin 1992 ; Phillips and Comus 2000 ) . Capture We traversed unpaved roads of BANWR at night and used a spotlight to locate antelope jackrabbits ( FatMax 900 Lumen LED , Stanley Tools , Towson , MD ) . We used a hoop net ( Mighty Net 34” × 40” , TJB Inc . , Hamden , CT ) or handheld net launcher ( MagNet , Wildlife Capture Services , Flagstaff , AZ ) to capture animals . We captured animals in both the northern and southern sites . After capture , we transferred animals to a black nylon sack ( approximately 71 cm by 96 cm ) . To weigh animals , we used a 30 kg capacity hanging scale ( UltraSport V2 - 30 , JScale , Phoenix , AZ ) and measured the right hind foot . We documented the sex and reproductive status of each animal ( Altemus et al . 2017 ) . We used a self - piercing metal numbered ear tag ( Monel # 3 , National Band & Tag , Newport , KY ) to identify each animal . We fitted VHF radio collars ( Model LPM - 2180A , Wildlife Materials , Murphysboro , IL ) on adult animals and released them where they were captured . All field work was conducted in accordance with the American Society of Mammal - ogists guidelines and approved by the University of Arizona’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( Sikes and the Animal Care and Use Committee of the American Society of Mammalogists 2016 ; IACUC pro - tocol # 13 - 480 ) . Field methods were conducted under permits from the Arizona Game and Fish Department ( LIC # SP654189 ) and Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge ( Special Use Permit # 2013 - 028 ) . Home range size We located animals at least once per week , between 0800 – 0030 hours , with a three - element folding Yagi antenna ( Wildlife Materials , Inc . , Murphysboro , IL ) and VHF receiver ( TRX - 2000S , Wildlife Materials , Inc . , Murphysburo , IL ) . We used single - person biangulation to determine an animal’s location at a given time ( “ location” ) , with interbearing intervals < 10 min . We used Backpacker GPS Trails ( Trimble Navigation Ltd . , Sunnyvale , CA ) to record animal locations . We used the “best biangulation” function in Location of a Signal ( LOAS ; Ecological Software Solutions LLC , Hegymagas , Hungary ) to estimate animal locations . We ran the MCP Sample Size Bootstrap analysis in ArcView ( 3 . 3 , Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc . ( ESRI ) , Redlands , CA ) as a function of animal locations to determine the asymptote for home range size . We used the Spatial Analyst ( ESRI ) and Animal Movement exten - sions ( Hooge and Eichenlaub 1997 ; Laver and Kelly 2008 ) in ArcView to calculate 95 % ( home range ) and 50 % ( core area ) fixed kernel density estimates . We per - formed t - tests to compare core area and home range sizes between females and males . Seasonal range size We separated animal locations into four biologically relevant seasons : winter ( wet ) , spring ( dry ) , monsoon ( wet ) , and fall ( dry ) . Winter months were December , January , February , and March . Spring months were April , May , and June . Monsoon months were July , August , and September . Fall months were October and November . We estimated 50 % fixed kernel density estimates ( “seasonal core” ) and 95 % fixed kernel density estimates ( “seasonal range” ) for each animal in each season . We calculated seasonal ranges for animals that had locations in each season . We used a repeated measures analysis of variance test ( ANOVA ) to compare mean seasonal core size and sea - sonal range size among seasons ( Keppel 1991 ) . We used a multiple regression analysis to determine the effect of sex , season , and site on the seasonal range size . For each animal , we calculated the area ( ha ) that each seasonal range overlapped with the home range ; we divided that area by the home range size to calculate percent of home range ( HR ) used . For each season , we averaged all HR usage percentages . We compared mean HR usage percentages between seasons using a single factor ANOVA ( Sokal and Rohlf 1981 ) . For each animal , we calculated the area ( ha ) that all 124 Mammal Study 44 ( 2019 ) seasonal ranges overlapped by using the intersect tool in ArcMap ( 10 . 3 . 1 , ESRI ) and creating a new polygon ( Ov below ) . We determined the degree of interseason similarity for each animal ( Misiorowska 2013 ) . The degree of interseason similarity indicates how much of the seasonal ranges are common over all four seasons . The degree of interseason similarity formula is : DIS = 4 Ov × 100 [ % ] ( Wn + Sp + Mn + Fl ) where DIS is the degree of interseason similarity ; Ov is the area ( ha ) that all seasons overlap ; and Wn , Sp , Mn , and Fl are the seasonal range estimates ( ha ) . We multiplied Ov by four because we have four seasons ( Misiorowska 2013 ) . We conducted a t - test to determine whether a difference existed in degree of interseason similarity between males and females . Mean ± 1 SD is provided within the results . Results Home range size Between December 2013 and November 2015 , we monitored 22 radio - collared animals ( Table 2 ) . Home range size became stable with between 20 – 25 locations and we obtained a sufficient number of locations on 13 animals to calculate home range estimates . We calculated home range estimates for five females ( mean weight 3 . 0 kg ± 1 . 1 ) and seven males ( mean weight 3 . 7 kg ± 0 . 7 ) , however one female ( F19 ) had an uncharacteristically large home range ( > 2200 % larger than the mean ) and was excluded from the home range and seasonal range analysis . We calculated home range estimates for animals ( n = 12 ) with at least 23 locations , averaging of 47 . 8 ± 23 . 2 locations per animal . Mean core area was 5 . 20 ± 3 . 87 ha and mean home range was 29 . 14 ± 15 . 58 ha ( n = 12 ) ( Table 2 ) . Core and home range areas tended to be slightly larger for males , however the difference was not significant ( core : t 10 = 1 . 79 , P = 0 . 10 ; home range : t 10 = 2 . 04 , P = 0 . 07 ) . Seasonal range size We calculated seasonal core area and seasonal range estimates for eight animals ( five males , three females ) , collected between December 2013 and November 2015 . Mean number of locations per animal per season was 14 . 69 ± 10 . 05 . Seasonal core area sizes and seasonal range sizes did not differ for any season ( Table 3 ; core by season : F 3 , 21 = 0 . 59 , P = 0 . 63 ; range by season : F 3 , 21 = 2 . 22 , P = 0 . 12 ) .

Altemus et al . , Antelope jackrabbit home range 125 The multiple regression analysis revealed that the rela - tionship between seasonal range and site , season , and sex was not significant ( F 3 , 28 = 1 . 66 , P = 0 . 20 , R 2 = 0 . 15 ) ; however sex did have significant explanatory power ( b = 13 . 08 , t 28 = 2 . 15 , P = 0 . 04 ) . Mean HR usage percentage differed between seasons with overlap maximal during the monsoon season ( Table 3 ; F 3 , 28 = 5 . 01 , P < 0 . 01 ) . Degree of interseason similarity ranged from 14 . 97 % to 48 . 72 % , with a mean of 27 . 29 % ± 11 . 46 . Both sexes did not differ in degree of interseason similarity ( t 6 = 1 . 32 , P = 0 . 23 ) . Discussion Estimates of antelope jackrabbit home range size were similar to home range sizes for other Lepus species , including black - tailed jackrabbits ( French et al . 1965 ; Smith 1990 ) , Tehuantepec jackrabbits ( Carrillo - Reyes et al . 2010 ) , and European hares ( L . europaeus ; Table 1 ; Kunst et al . 2001 ) . Male antelope jackrabbits tended to have larger home ranges than females , which is similar to black - tailed jackrabbits ( Smith 1990 ) and Tehuantepec jackrabbits ( Farías et al . 2006 ) . Although antelope jackrabbits are primarily crepuscular , however , observers often saw animals moving throughout the day , especially in the afternoon as the sun began to set . While telemetry locations were primarily acquired during daylight hours , it is likely that these locations captured animal move - ment in addition to resting periods . Seasonal range sizes did not differ despite the season - ality of weather and vegetation found in the study area . We would also expect seasonal range sizes to differ in this species based on the fact that seasonal ranges are found in other species of Lepus ( e . g . , Carrillo - Reyes et al . 2010 ) . This is surprising since other lagomorphs , including the mountain hare ( L . timidus ) , have smaller ranges when available biomass was higher ( Hulbert et al . 1996 ) . Like - wise , black - tailed jackrabbits in Utah had different range sizes through different seasons , with spring and fall ranges being the smallest ( Smith 1990 ) . Although the sizes of seasonal range remained stable , differences in HR usage percentage indicate that antelope jackrabbits shift ranges spatially based on season . Mon - soon ( wet ) ranges had the highest HR usage percentage and were only slightly larger than spring ( dry ) seasons . Monsoon and spring values were much higher than both winter ( wet ) and fall ( dry ) HR usage percentages . In the desert environment , vegetation quality is influenced by water availability ( Nicholson et al . 1990 ) . However , patterns of antelope jackrabbit space use did not follow seasonal moisture trends . Animals respond to scarcity of resources differently . For example , the European hare restricts movements to save energy ( Kunst et al . 2001 ) , whereas mountain hares have larger home range sizes when food availability is low ( Hulbert et al . 1996 ) . Alternatively , longer range movements leading to shift - ing seasonal ranges could be a result of other influences including breeding dispersal or exploration ( Baars 1979 ; Greenwood 1980 ; Van Dyck and Baguette 2005 ) . Because jackrabbit breeding occurs year - round , animals may traverse the landscape constantly in search of mates ( Vorhies and Taylor 1933 ; Madsen 1974 ) . Mean degree of interseason similarity was relatively low , indicating animals move throughout home ranges widely , also evidenced by differences in HR usage per - centages . Lower degree of interseason similarity indicates that animals may not be using the same areas for different seasonal ranges , whereas , a higher value is indicative of an inactive and sedentary lifestyle ( Misiorowska 2013 ) . The analysis of seasonal ranges seems to indicate that antelope jackrabbit forage availability is steady through - out seasons , as evidenced by the stability in seasonal range size . While seasonal range size did not fluctuate , HR usage percentage and degree of interseason similar - ity analysis may indicate that antelope jackrabbits are moving throughout their range to follow changes in veg - etation composition . With fluctuating precipitation and drought patterns , forage composition changes seasonally , Table 3 .

Research on understudied species is important for conservation and management purposes , as well as for understanding a species’ role in overall ecosystem func - tion . While the ecology and behavior of some lagomorphs is well - studied , many less common and endemic species have not been thoroughly investigated ( Chapman and Flux 2008 ; Smith et al . 2018 ) . Further knowledge of complex ecological relationships , such as landscape use and habitat selection , are critical to provide insight into how lagomorph populations will respond to future challenges such as climate change ( Beever et al . 2003 ; Morrison and Hik 2007 ) .
