A R T I C L E S Protein kinase D1 regulates cofilin - mediated F - actin reorganization and cell motility through slingshot Tim Eiseler 1 , Heike Döppler 1 , Irene K . Yan 1 , Kanae Kitatani 2 , Kensaku Mizuno 2 and Peter Storz 1 , 3 Dynamic actin remodelling processes at the leading edge of migrating tumour cells are concerted events controlled by a fine - tuned temporal and spatial interplay of kinases and phosphatases . Actin severing is regulated by actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin , which regulates stimulus - induced lamellipodia protrusion and directed cell motility . Cofilin is activated by dephosphorylation through phosphatases of the slingshot ( SSH ) family . SSH activity is strongly increased by its binding to filamentous actin ( F - actin ) ; however , other upstream regulators remain unknown . Here we show that in response to RhoA activation , protein kinase D1 ( PKD1 ) phosphorylates the SSH enzyme SSH1L at a serine residue located in its actin - binding motif . This generates a 14 - 3 - 3 - binding motif and blocks the localization of SSH1L to F - actin - rich structures in the lamellipodium by sequestering it in the cytoplasm . Consequently , expression of constitutively active PKD1 in invasive tumour cells enhanced the phosphorylation of cofilin and effectively blocked the formation of free actin - filament barbed ends and directed cell migration . Migratory competence of tumour cells requires the activation of the ‘motile cycle’ , the first step of which is actin remodelling , which drives the formation of cell protrusions , defines the direction of migration and initiates the growth of the lamellipodium . Dynamic actin remodelling processes at the leading edge of migrating tumour cells are complex , with areas showing increased actin filament severing , capping and dendritic branching 1 , 2 . The concerted regulation of these events is mediated by a complex temporal and spatial interplay of Rho GTPases , kinases and phosphatases . A key regulator of polarized cell motility is the F - actin depolymeri - zation and severing factor ADF / cofilin ( cofilin ) 3 , 4 . By severing actin filaments , cofilin increases free barbed ends , which are the preferred substrate for dendritic nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex 3 . Cofilin is highly expressed in multiple cancers , including pancreatic cancer and invasive breast cancer 5 , 6 . The net effect of the regulation of cofilin activity by signalling cascades mediates whether or not a tumour cell migrates 6 , 7 . The activity of cofilin is regulated mainly by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events , which allow rapid regulation of the enzyme in different regions of the migrating tumour cell 7 , 8 . Phosphorylation of cofilin at serine residue 3 ( S3 ) , which is mediated by the LIM kinases ( LIMK ; Lin - 11 / Isl - 1 / Mec - 3 kinases ) LIMK1 or LIMK2 ( refs 1 , 9 ) and by TESK ( testicular protein kinases ) 10 , 11 , leads to a loss of actin binding and severing activities and subsequently results in decreased directed cell motility 12 . The rapid actin - remodelling events at the progressing leading edge of migrating cells require a rapid modulation of cofilin activity 6 . The dephosphorylation of S3 by slingshot ( SSH ) phosphatases reacti - vates cofilin 13 , 14 . The regulation of slingshots is not well understood , although recently a potential regulation by the phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase pathway was implicated 15 . Further , the SSH member SSH1L is regulated by association with filamentous actin , which increases its phosphatase activity 13 . The relocalization of SSH1 at the leading edge of cells is controlled by the phosphorylation - dependent recruitment of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , but the functional consequences are not well defined 13 . PKD1 is a serine / threonine kinase that until now has not been impli - cated in the regulation of cofilin activity and actin remodelling at the lamellipodium of migrating tumour cells . Depending on its subcellular localization , PKD1 regulates a variety of cellular functions ( reviewed in ref . 7 ) , including membrane receptor signalling 16 , transport processes at the Golgi 17 , 18 , protection from oxidative stress at the mitochondria 19 and transcriptional regulation in the nucleus 20 . Recent studies suggest an involvement of PKD1 in the regulation of cell shape , motility and adhe - sion 21 – 23 . However , conclusive molecular mechanisms linking PKD1 to cytoskeletal reorganization and also to mechanisms affecting cell motil - ity have remained elusive . Here we describe the localized phosphorylation of substrates that regulate actin organization as a potential mechanism by which PKD1 exerts its effects on cell motility . Specifically , we identify SSH1L as a substrate whose phosphorylation by PKD1 mediates relocalization and inhibition , which translates to altered cofilin activity , actin reorganiza - tion and decreased directed cell motility . 1 Department of Cancer Biology , Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center , Mayo Clinic , 4500 San Pablo Road , Jacksonville , Florida 32224 , USA . 2 Department of Biomolecular Sciences , Graduate School of Life Sciences , Tohoku University , Sendai , Miyagi 980 - 8578 , Japan . 3 Correspondence should be addressed to P .

A RT I C L E S RESuLTS PKD1 co - localizes with F - actin and SSH1L Immunohistochemistry of endogenous and overexpressed PKD1 in cer - vical carcinoma cells revealed co - localization with F - actin at peripheral F - actin - rich structures in membrane ruffles at the edge of lamellipo - dia ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . This co - locali - zation was independent of the PKD1 activity status ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . To test whether PKD1 interacts directly with F - actin structures , we performed acceptor photobleach fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) studies in fixed samples of cells expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged PKD1 ( donor ) and stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( F - actin : acceptor ) . FRET between the fluorophore - labelled proteins suggested binding or interaction of PKD1 and F - actin ( Fig . 1b ) . These data are supported by recent in vitro studies showing that PKD1 binds to filamentous actin 21 . Here we show in vivo evidence for such an interaction , further pointing to a novel regulatory function of PKD1 in the F - actin cytoskeletal compartment . Immunohistochemistry also revealed that SSH1L , a known F - actin - binding protein 13 , 24 , localized to F - actin structures at the edge of lamel - lipodia and in membrane ruffles , in a similar manner to PKD1 ( Fig . 1c ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . We therefore investigated the localization of PKD1 and SSH1L in relation to F - actin ( Fig . 1d ) . Both proteins localize together at the same filamentous actin structures at the periphery of membrane protrusions ( Fig . 1d , merge ) . However , both also displayed considerable overlapping cytoplasmic localiza - tion , which is in line with single staining of both endogenous proteins ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a , c ) . Acceptor photobleach FRET analysis with GFP - tagged PKD1 as donor and Alexa Fluor 568 - labelled Myc - tagged SSH1L as acceptor showed a direct interaction of both pro - teins in the cytoplasm and also in membrane protrusions ( Fig . 1e ) . This suggests a direct co - localization and interaction of PKD1 and SSH1L at F - actin - rich structures at the periphery of cells .

A RT I C L E S PKD1 regulates SSH1L by phosphorylation at S978 We next investigated whether slingshot is a substrate for PKD1 . To test this we used an antibody specifically designed to recognize PKD substrates ( anti - pMotif ) , which has previously been characterized in detail 25 . We detected enhanced phosphorylation of SSH1L when co - expressed with active PKD1 , and decreased phosphorylation when co - expressed with kinase - inactive PKD1 , indicating that PKD1 mediates the phosphorylation of SSH1L in vivo ( Fig . 2a ) . We also used reverse genetics in which we knocked down PKD with specific RNA - mediated interference ( RNAi ) . To enhance PKD1 activity , cells were stimulated with hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , which is a strong inducer of PKD1 activation 26 – 28 . A knockdown of PKD1 decreased the H 2 O 2 - mediated phosphorylation of SSH1L in comparison with the RNAi control , indicating that SSH1L is indeed a substrate of PKD1 ( Fig . 2b ) . By analysing the secondary structure of SSH1L for motifs that correspond to the optimal PKD1 consensus motif 29 we identified two putative phospho - rylation sites ( S937 and S978 ) ( Fig . 2c ) . To analyse whether PKD1 directly phosphorylates SSH1L at these sites , we performed in vitro kinase assays with purified , active PKD1 and bacterially expressed , purified glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tagged SSH1L encompassing the potential PKD1 phos - phorylation sites as well as GST – SSH1L serine - to - alanine mutants of these a b PKD1 consensus L X R X X S * SSH1L S937 L T R S S S * SSH1L S978 L K R S H S * Hsp27 S82 L S R Q L S * c Putative PKD sites : Re - probed : anti - GFP / YFP IP : anti - GFP / YFP Det : anti - pMotif Control blots : Western blot : anti - Actin Actin V ec t o r P K D 1 .

Our in vitro kinase assays suggested that PKD1 directly phosphorylates SSH1L at S978 but not at S937 . After this initial mapping we confirmed the phosphorylation of S978 by PKD1 in vitro with a phospho - site - specific antibody directed against phospho - S978 - SSH1L ( Fig . 2e ) 13 . The phosphorylation of S978 in vivo was confirmed by co - expression of active PKD1 with wild - type SSH1L or a SSH1L . S978A mutant ( Fig . 2f ) . The S978A mutation of SSH1L abrogated the phosphorylation detected with the phospho - S978 - SSH1L antibody , demonstrating both the specificity of the phospho - specific antibody used and that S978 is indeed phosphorylated by PKD1 in vivo . PKD1 regulates SSH1L downstream of RhoA The Rho GTPase RhoA and slingshot both have been implicated in the regu - lation of directed cell migration 30 .

A RT I C L E S SSH1L with the phospho - S978 - SSH1L antibody revealed a RhoA - mediated regulation of the phosphorylation at this site ( Fig . 3a ) . Next , we analysed whether RhoA - mediated activation of PKD1 regulates the phosphoryla - tion of endogenous SSH1L at S978 . Constitutively active RhoA ( RhoA . CA ) clearly enhanced the phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 ; this was decreased when cells were treated with the Rho inhibitor C3 ( Fig . 3b ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) . Similar results were obtained when SSH1L was overexpressed ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2c ) . Treatment of cells with C3 also released PKD1 from the F - actin structures at the leading edge ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2c ) . To directly link RhoA - mediated phosphorylation of SSH1L to PKD1 , we expressed a kinase - dead PKD1 or knocked - down PKD in cells and tested their responsiveness to active RhoA , using SSH1L phosphorylation as readout . We found that both a loss of PKD1 kinase activity and a knockdown of PKD blocked RhoA - mediated phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 ( Fig . 3c , d ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S2d , e ) . This suggests that SSH1L is a PKD1 substrate downstream of active RhoA . Active PKD1 regulates dissociation of SSH1L from the actin cytoskeleton Next we investigated the consequences of PKD1 - mediated phosphoryla - tion of SSH1L at S978 . We co - expressed active PKD1 ( PKD1 . CA ) with wild - type SSH1L or its S978A or S937A mutants to investigate their sub - cellular localization in relation to F - actin . In the absence of active PKD1 , wild - type SSH1L and the mutants strongly co - localized with F - actin - rich structures at the periphery of the cell ( Supplementary Information , Figs S2a and S4a ) . However , after expression of active PKD1 , SSH1L and the SSH1L . S738A mutant displayed mostly cytoplasmic staining ( Fig . 4b , d ) . In con - trast , the SSH1L . S978A mutant was still localized at F - actin structures at the cell periphery ( Fig . 4c ) . The expression of kinase - inactive PKD1 ( PKD1 . KD ) did not lead to a redistribution of wild - type SSH1L , underlin - ing the importance of PKD1 kinase activity for this regulation ( Fig . 4e ) . We confirmed the immunofluorescence data with a biochemical approach , by analysing the F - actin - containing and cytosolic fractions of cells . In control cells SSH1L was localized mainly in the F - actin fraction , whereas in the presence of active PKD1 , SSH1L was increasingly found in the cytosolic fraction ( Fig . 4f ) . Further , active PKD1 also increased the abundance of an SSH1L . S937A mutant in the cytosolic fraction , whereas an SSH1L . S978A mutant , which is not targeted by PKD1 , remained almost exclusively in the F - actin fraction ( Fig . 4f ) . Taken together , these results show that PKD1 , independently of its kinase activity , is localized at peripheral F - actin struc - tures such as membrane ruffles or lamellipodia . However , the localization of SSH1L at these structures is heavily dependent on its phosphorylation at S978 , which is mediated by PKD1 . P K D 1 . K D SSH1L Merge SSH1L . S978A Merge SSH1L .

A RT I C L E S PKD1 - mediated phosphorylation of SSH1L facilitates binding of 14 - 3 - 3 We next sought to identify the cellular mechanisms of how PKD1 - mediated phosphorylation regulates SSH1L localization on a molecu - lar level . It has previously been suggested 13 that both S937 and S978 form the core motif of a binding site for 14 - 3 - 3β or 14 - 3 - 3ζ . Further , a F - actin binding motif ( L - K - R ) has been described 24 within the L - K - R - S - H - S 978 phosphorylation motif surrounding S978 of SSH1L . We therefore proposed that PKD1 - mediated phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 leads to 14 - 3 - 3 binding and abrogates F - actin binding of this site , ultimately resulting in altered subcellular localization of SSH1L . a Re - probed : anti - SSH1L Probed : anti - 14 - 3 - 3 β IP : anti - Myc , Det : anti - pS978 - SSH1L V ec t o r P K D 1 .

A RT I C L E S To test this , we analysed whether the binding of SSH1L to 14 - 3 - 3 proteins is mediated by PKD1 . We expressed a constitutively active PKD1 , which enhanced the phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 and also increased its binding to 14 - 3 - 3β ( Fig . 5a ) . Oxidative stress , which potently activates PKD1 , served as a positive control and also led to the binding of 14 - 3 - 3β to SSH1L . Expression of kinase - dead PKD1 acted in a dominant - negative manner and suppressed both S978 phosphorylation and binding of 14 - 3 - 3β proteins ( Fig . 5a ) . Similar results were obtained with 14 - 3 - 3ζ , suggesting that both 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms interact with SSH1L in a PKD1 - mediated fashion ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b ) . Further , depletion of PKD by RNAi decreased both the phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 and the binding of 14 - 3 - 3β in response to the potent PKD1 activator H 2 O 2 or the expression of active RhoA ( Fig . 5b , c ) .

All rights reserved . A RT I C L E S we compared PKD1 - mediated binding of 14 - 3 - 3β proteins with that of wild - type SSH1L and the SSH1L . S978A mutant . The S978A mutation abolished the co - precipitation of 14 - 3 - 3β , indicating that the interaction of 14 - 3 - 3β with SSH1L is completely dependent on the 14 - 3 - 3 - binding motif created at the PKD1 phosphorylation site ( Fig . 5d ) . We then analysed whether binding to 14 - 3 - 3ζ alters the cellular locali - zation of SSH1L . In control - transfected cells , SSH1L or the SSH1L . S978A mutant displayed a broad co - localization with F - actin structures ( Fig . 5e , E1 – E4 and E9 – E12 ) . Cells expressing wild - type SSH1L and 14 - 3 - 3ζ showed a strong co - localization of both proteins and a sequestration of SSH1L in the cytoplasm away from F - actin structures ( Fig . 5e , E5 – E8 , middle row ) . In contrast , co - expression of SSH1L . S978A with 14 - 3 - 3ζ showed no such phenotype , and SSH1L . S978A remained localized at F - actin - rich structures in the cell periphery , whereas 14 - 3 - 3ζ was mainly localized in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 5e , E13 – E18 , bottom row ) . These data suggest that binding of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins to the phosphorylated PKD1 consensus motif at S978 is the most likely mechanism by which the subcellular localization of SSH1L is regulated through PKD1 . PKD1 regulates cofilin phosphorylation The localization of SSH1L to F - actin enhances SSH1L phosphatase activity towards cofilin 13 . We therefore next determined whether the regulation of SSH1L by PKD1 had an impact on its activity towards cofilin . Cofilin phosphorylation at S3 can be used as a direct measure for cofilin activity , and decreased phosphorylation of this residue is due to increased activity of cofilin phosphatases such as SSH1L 13 , 14 . Increased PKD activity , as mimicked with a constitutively active PKD1 mutant , resulted in increased cofilin phosphorylation at S3 , and the expres - sion of a kinase - dead PKD1 allele decreased cofilin phosphorylation at this site ( Fig . 6a ) . We also compared cells depleted of PKD ( by using spe - cific RNAi ) with cells treated with control RNAi and analysed the cofilin phosphorylation status in response to PKD1 activation by oxidative stress or active RhoA ( RhoA . CA ) . Both oxidative stress and RhoA activation enhanced cofilin phosphorylation at S3 , suggesting increased inhibi - tion due to PKD1 - mediated signalling events ( Fig . 6b , c ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S4c ) . Our data show that both activators of PKD1 regulate SSH1L by phosphorylation , in a PKD1 - dependent manner . Further , these results suggest that SSH1L , once phosphorylated by PKD1 and sequestered by 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , is inactive towards cofilin phosphorylated at S3 . Finally , we tested whether the effects on the cofilin S3 phosphorylation signal are indeed due to PKD1 - mediated phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 . We co - expressed active PKD1 with wild - type or S978A - mutant SSH1L and ana - lysed cofilin phosphorylation at S3 as a measure of cofilin activity ( Fig . 6d ) . Both wild - type SSH1L and the SSH1L . S978A mutant decreased the basal phosphorylation levels of cofilin . However , the expression of active PKD1 increased the phosphorylation of wild - type cofilin at S3 , whereas there was no increase in phosphorylation in cells expressing SSH1L . S978A . This indi - cates that the effects of PKD1 on cofilin phosphorylation at S3 are mediated through its phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 . Finally , we determined whether PKD1 alters endogenous cofilin phosphorylation . To test this we subjected cell lysates of control cells or cells transfected with constitutively active PKD1 to isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) – PAGE . Active PKD1 increased the levels of phospho - S3 - cofilin ( Fig . 6e ) . A quantitative analysis of the percentage of phospho - cofilin determined from total cofilin suggests that active PKD1 increased endogenous phospho - cofilin levels in HeLa cells from 8 . 7 ± 3 . 2 % of the total cofilin in untreated cells to 36 . 9 ± 12 % . We also found that endog - enous , basal phospho - S3 - cofilin levels were decreased when cells were depleted of PKD . Knockdown of PKD decreased phospho - S3 - cofilin levels in comparison with control cells , from 9 . 4 ± 2 . 7 % of the total cofi - lin in control cells to 2 . 6 ± 0 . 6 % ( Fig . 6e ; errors are s . d . ) . PKD1 inhibits barbed - end formation and directed cell migration The activity status of the cofilin pathway and the subsequent generation of barbed ends correlate with the ability of cells to migrate towards a chemotactic stimulus 4 , 33 . Because PKD1 negatively regulates the SSH1L - mediated dephosphorylation and activation of cofilin , we proposed that this also has an impact on the cells’ ability to migrate . To test this we first determined the effect of active PKD1 on the formation of free actin - filament barbed ends . We found that active PKD1 completely blocked the formation of free actin barbed ends , suggesting an impor - tant role of PKD1 in blocking cofilin - mediated cell migration ( Fig . 7a ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S5a , b ) . We next analysed wild - type , constitutively active PKD1 or inac - tive mutants of PKD1 for their effects on directional cell migration in Boyden chamber / transwell chemotaxis assays . Constitutively active PKD1 significantly decreased cell migration in both HeLa and MTLn3 cells ( Fig . 7b ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S5c ) . Short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) directed against PKD1 or the expression of kinase - dead ( PKD1 . KD ) or inactive PKD1 ( PKD1 . SSAA ) mutants increased cell motility ( Fig . 7c ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S5d ) . In addition to the transwell chemotaxis assays , we performed cell tracking assays in which we compared directed cell migration of MTLn3 cells express - ing constitutively active PKD1 or vector control towards NIH - 3T3 - conditioned medium using µ - Slide chemotaxis ( Fig . 7d ) . Control cells had an average velocity of 24 µm h −1 and a directionality of 0 . 21 , whereas cells transfected with constitutively active PKD1 had an average velocity of 18 µm h −1 and a directionality of 0 . 08 . These effects on directed cell motility confirmed the results obtained with the transwell chemotaxis assays . PKD1 and mutants had no significant effects on random cell migration ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5e ) , suggesting a specific role of PKD1 in directed cell migration . We next determined whether PKD1 exerts its inhibitory function on directed cell migration through its activity on SSH1L . The co - expression of active PKD1 with SSH1L significantly decreased directed cell migration in comparison with SSH1L alone . This was rescued by the SSH1L . S978A mutant , which cannot be phosphorylated by PKD1 ( Fig . 7e ) . Because slingshots directly regulate phospho - cofilin levels , we then determined whether constitutively active PKD1 affects cofilin - mediated cell migra - tion ( Fig . 7f ) . We found that cell migration was increased in cells express - ing wild - type cofilin or a cofilin . S3A mutant , which cannot be regulated by SSH1L and LIMK . The co - expression of active PKD1 inhibited the effects on cell migration mediated by the wild - type cofilin , but did not block effects mediated by the cofilin . S3A mutant ( Fig . 7f ) . This was most probably due to PKD1 - mediated regulation of SSH1L . As a control , a cofilin . S3E mutant mimicking the phosphorylation of this site inhibited cell migration . Taken together , our data identify PKD1 as a key regulator of the SSH1L – cofilin signalling pathway and directed cell migration .

All rights reserved . A RT I C L E S activation and inactivation 2 , 6 , 7 , which is mediated by phosphorylation through LIMK and dephosphorylation by slingshot phosphatases 10 , 11 . Relatively little is known about the regulation of slingshot , and by dem - onstrating its phosphorylation by PKD1 we here define a new regulation mechanism for this phosphatase . Rho GTPases are key regulators of cell migration , and they control many processes of cell adhesion and actin dynamics . Cdc42 and Rac1 have been implicated in regulating the formation of filopodia and lamel - lipodia , whereas RhoA is important in the inhibition of actin severing at the leading edge 34 . PKD1 is activated downstream of RhoA 32 ; how - ever , the functions of this activation are not well defined . We found that RhoA - mediated activation of PKD1 leads to the phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 and the subsequent inhibition of cofilin ( Figs 3 and 6 ) . Another PKD1 activation pathway , mediated by oxidative stress , also leads to similar SSH1L regulation ( Figs 3 and 6 ) . Activation of PKD1 in response to both stimuli is mediated by novel protein kinase C ( nPKC ) enzymes , which induce PKD1 activation loop phosphorylation 35 . The activation of both nPKC and PKD1 is dependent on the lipid co - activator diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , which targets these kinases to membrane struc - tures within cells 36 – 38 . Cleavage of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by PLC releases cofilin from its complex with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane 39 . This cleavage also generates DAG , which could recruit and activate PKD1 and its upstream kinases . Once activated , PKD1 then phosphorylates its substrate SSH1L , regulating its activity and subcellular localization . Serine residue 978 is located within a potential actin - binding motif in SSH1L 24 . SSH1L activity is strongly increased after binding to F - actin , resulting in the dephosphorylation and activation of cofilin 13 . We there - fore proposed that the phosphorylation of this residue by PKD1 regulates SSH1L – actin interactions and SSH1L activity towards cofilin . The PKD1 - mediated phosphorylation of SSH1L at S978 generates a 14 - 3 - 3 - binding motif ( RSXpS ) , which is a common feature of PKD1 substrates 17 . Our results indicate that 14 - 3 - 3 binding allows the sequestration of SSH1L away from filamentous actin ( Fig . 5 ) , resulting in decreased activity towards cofilin at the leading edge . The activity status of cofilin is directly relayed to the motility of cancer cells 4 , 6 , 40 . This prompted us to investigate whether PKD1 exerts effects on cofilin - mediated actin remodelling of the dendritic network . The expres - sion of active PKD1 in MTLn3 cells , which are a genuine model system for barbed - end formation 6 , demonstrated that PKD1 induced a global inhibition of actin incorporation ( Fig . 7a ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S5a , b ) . Our data suggest the following mechanism : PKD1 - mediated SSH1L phosphorylation effectively renders cofilin inactive , thereby failing to generate sufficient barbed ends for actin polymerization and Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching 41 . Similar marked effects on barbed - end formation have been described after overexpression of LIMK 4 , 7 , 8 , 42 , 43 . Given that LIMK is also activated downstream of a RhoA – ROCK signalling cascade 30 , it is plausible that both enzymes — LIMK and PKD1 — synergize to facilitate the inactivation of cofilin . It is also possible that PKD1 , in addition to regulating SSH1L activity , also activates LIMK . However , in HeLa cells LIMK had only basal activity , and a knockdown of endogenous PKD1 had no significant effects on the activity of endogenous LIMK in control or RhoA - stimulated cells ( data not shown ) . The inhibition of barbed - end formation by PKD1 directly trans - lated to a decrease in directed cell migration of tumour cells ( Fig . 7b – d ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S5c , d ) . This correlates with data obtained with pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines , in which the stable overexpression of PKD1 also inhibited cell migration 21 . Directed cell migration in response to a chemotactic stimulus requires cofilin activa - tion at the leading edge . However , it also requires tight regulation or inactivation of cofilin in areas other than the lamellipodium , allowing only controlled and cyclic actin severing at the leading edge 6 . Such glo - bal inactivation of cofilin is also mediated by RhoA and is required for prevention of the uncontrolled formation of additional lamellipodia , to ensure directed cell migration 8 . Our data point to a role of PKD1 - mediated regulation of SSH1L at the leading edge . We predict that PKD1 , depending on its intracellular localization , could have important func - tions in vivo during other stages of the cofilin cycling process . Our data also suggested clustering of subcellular pools of PKD1 and SSH1L at perinuclear structures ( Fig . 1d ) , which are most probably parts of the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) . A Golgi - located pool of PKD1 has been shown to facilitate vesicular transport from the TGN to the plasma mem - brane 17 . Our observation also indicates a potential function of PKD1 / SSH1L signalling in actin remodelling events at the TGN complex involved in the scission of transport vesicles 18 . In summary , this study links PKD1 to cofilin - induced actin remodelling processes , which are essential for the initiation of polarized cell migration of cancer cells . We show that PKD1 regulates cofilin by phosphorylation of its activator SSH1L at S978 , thereby creating a 14 - 3 - 3 - binding motif . Binding of 14 - 3 - 3 to SSH1L results in the release of this phosphatase from F - actin and to its sequestration in the cytoplasm .
