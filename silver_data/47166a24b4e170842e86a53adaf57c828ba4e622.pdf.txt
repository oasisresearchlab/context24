This article is published with open access Abstract Tumor - repopulating cells ( TRCs ) are cancer stem cell ( CSC ) - like cells with highly tumorigenic and self - renewing abilities , which were selected from tumor cells in soft three - dimensional ( 3D ) ﬁ brin gels with unidenti ﬁ ed mechanisms . Here we evaluated the transcriptome alteration during TRCs generation in 3D culture and revealed that a variety of molecules related with integrin / membrane and stemness were continuously altered by mechanical environment . Some key regulators such as MYC / STAT3 / hsa - miR - 199a - 5p , were changed in the TRCs generation . They regulated membrane genes and the downstream mechanotransduction pathways such as Hippo / WNT / TGF - β / PI3K - AKT pathways , thus further affecting the expression of downstream cancer - related genes . By integrating networks for membrane proteins , the WNT pathway and cancer - related genes , we identi ﬁ ed key molecules in the selection of TRCs , such as ATF4 , SLC3A2 , CCT3 , and hsa - miR - 199a - 5p . Silencing ATF4 or CCT3 inhibited the selection and growth of TRCs whereas reduction of SLC3A2 or hsa - miR - 199a - 5p promoted TRCs growth . Further studies showed that CCT3 promoted cell proliferation and stemness in vitro , while its suppression inhibited TRCs - induced tumor formation . We also contemplated CCT3 as a stemness - related gene . Our ﬁ ndings provide insights in the mechanism of TRCs selection through transcriptome analysis . Introduction Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) are a small subpopulation of cancer cells identi ﬁ ed in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumor types with high tumorigenicity and high cap - abilities of self - renewal [ 1 ] . CSCs may be the source of tumor initiation , progression , metastasis , relapse , and resistance to chemotherapy [ 2 ] . Although there are several hypotheses about the CSCs origin , a lack of clear under - standing about its origin limits the development of CSC - targeted therapy [ 3 ] . Our previous work has developed a mechanical method to select and / or generate CSC - like tumor - repopulating cells ( TRCs ) from cancer cells by cul - turing them in soft three - dimensional ( 3D ) ﬁ brin gels [ 4 ] . These TRCs were selected as highly self - renewing tumorigenic subpopulation [ 5 ] that is crucial to tumor initiation and progression [ 4 , 6 ] . TRCs selected from B16 mice melanoma cells were able to initiate tumor in wild - These authors contributed equally : Wei Huang , Hui Hu * Xiangliang Yang yangxl @ hust . edu . cn * An - Yuan Guo guoay @ hust . edu . cn 1 National Engineering Research Center for Nanomedicine , College of Life Science and Technology , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , 430074 Wuhan , China 2 Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory , Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education , College of Life Science and Technology , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , 430074 Wuhan , China 3 Department of Biomedical Engineering , College of Life Science and Technology , Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan 430074 Hubei , China 4 Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering , College of Engineering , University of Illinois at Urbana – Champaign , Urbana , IL 61801 , USA Supplementary information The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41388 - 019 - 0925 - 0 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . 1234567890 ( ) ; , : 1234567890 ( ) ; , : type mice with as few as ten cells [ 4 ] . Cancer cells from several murine and human cell lines were able to be selected with the soft ﬁ brin gel approach [ 4 , 5 , 7 ] . Thus , the process of TRCs selection / transformation is a very good model to study the origin , feature and mechanism of CSCs . There - fore , a comprehensive study on expression and regulation of the origin of TRCs may give us insights into the acquisition of cancer stemness and potential targets for prevention and treatment of cancer . TRCs were selected or transformed by mechan - otransduction under 3D soft gels and there are a few studies about it . The force transduction from extracellular matrix ( ECM ) to the cytoskeleton is mediated by integrins , focal adhesions , and mechanosensitive ion channels on the plasma membrane [ 8 ] and then activated mechanoresponsive - signaling elements , such as transform - ing protein RHOA [ 9 ] . Some well - known transcription regulators , such as β - catenin ( WNT effector ) , YAP , and TAZ [ 10 ] , are functionally required for eliciting cellular mechanoresponses . There are four well - studied classical mechanotransduction pathways Hippo / Wnt / TGF - β / PI3K - AKT [ 11 ] , which may impact the stemness of cancers [ 12 ] . The self - renewing ability of TRCs was maintained by his - tone 3 lysine residue 9 ( H3K9 ) demethylation and Sox2 gene expression [ 5 ] . However , the regulatory network on gene expression and key regulators under mechan - otransduction of TRCs acquisition need to be uncovered . Transcription factors ( TFs ) and miRNAs are two kinds of key regulators in gene regulatory network . They can reg - ulate individually or co - regulate the same target gene to form a feedforward loop or feedback loop [ 13 ] , which plays an important role in diseases and biological processes [ 14 ] , including CSCs plasticity [ 15 ] . Several studies performed the transcriptome - pro ﬁ ling analysis for mechanical trans - duction in 3D co - cultured cardiomyocytes [ 16 ] , while few such study on TRCs was conducted . The transcriptome pro ﬁ ling and regulatory networks of the TRCs selection process could provide a comprehensive landscape to the underlying molecular and regulatory mechanisms and pro - vide new insights to cancer stemness . In this study , to better understand the TRCs selection and transformation , we sequenced the transcriptome and miRNA for samples that collected during the soft ﬁ brin gels selection process , followed by systematical bioinformatics analysis on expression and regulation . We used HeLa cells , the earliest human cancer - derived cell line established as a model for studying cancer in culture [ 17 ] , to examine how HeLa TRCs might differ from those unselected HeLa cells . We identi ﬁ ed and validated a few key regulators and genes , which were important in the TRCs selection process . It showed a comprehensive view of the gene expression and regulation for TRCs selection and provided potential targets for cancer therapy . Results Dynamic changes of gene expression in TRCs selection by 3D soft ﬁ brin gels To obtain and study the TRCs , we seeded the human cer - vical carcinoma HeLa cells into different stiffness ﬁ brin gels ( 90 , 420 , and 1050 Pa ) . HeLa cells grew into round multi - cellular tumor spheroid from day 1 to day 7 ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Fig S1 ) . HeLa cells cultured in 90 Pa ﬁ brin gels ( HeLa TRCs ) had signi ﬁ cant more colony numbers from day 1 and bigger colony size from day 3 than in the stiffer ones ( 420 or 1050 Pa ) ( Fig . 1b , c ) . Transwell assays showed that HeLa TRCs had appreciably higher migration and invasion ratios than HeLa cells cultured on rigid plastic ( HeLa 2D cells ) ( Fig . 1d ) . Expressions of well - known CSCs - related genes SOX2 / NANOG / ZFX / OCT4 ( POU5F1 ) [ 18 ] were all signi ﬁ cantly increased in TRCs compared with HeLa 2D cells at day 3 ( Fig . 1e ) . SOX2 and NANOG expression were signi ﬁ cantly increased from day 1 – 3 ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Together , these ﬁ ndings suggest that HeLa TRCs in 3D soft ﬁ brin gels are unique in pro - moting multicellular tumor spheroid formation and growth with enhanced self - renewing capacities . To study the dynamic changes of gene expression and regulatory mechanisms under TRCs selection and transfor - mation , we sequenced the HeLa 2D cells ( as 0 h ) and HeLa 3D TRCs at four time points : 12 h , 1 day , 3 day , and 5 day ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . As a result , high expressed genes in 2D cells were much more than 3D TRCs ( Supplementary Fig . S4A ) . Then , we conducted pairwise comparison analyses among the ﬁ ve samples and ﬁ ltered out 1305 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) including 28 TFs ( Fig . 1f ) and 118 differentially expressed miRNAs ( DEMs ) ( Supplementary Fig . S4B , C ) . About 81 % of these DEGs were in the com - parison of 12 h vs 0 h and most of them ( 97 . 5 % ) were downregulated ( Supplementary Fig . S4D ) . This indicates that many genes were signi ﬁ cantly altered as the mechanical environment changes by switching from rigid 2D plastic dishes to soft 3D gels . However , only 12 DEMs were chan - ged from 2D to 3D gels , which were much less than the DEMs in comparisons of 3 day vs 0 h ( 62 DEMs ) or 5 day vs 3 day ( 61 DEMs ) ( Supplementary Fig . S4C , D ) . We de ﬁ ned genes different between 12 h and 0 h as potential mechanical - related genes since the mechanical forces changed . We col - lected 144 integrin and focal adhesion related membrane protein genes and found only a small part of them were DEGs ( Supplementary Fig . S4E ) . Analyses revealed 394 genes and 49 miRNAs , whose expression was continuously increased or decreased from 12 h to 3 day . Among them , 25 genes and 8 miRNAs were reported to be associated with tumor growth and proliferation ( Fig . 1g , Supplementary Fig . S4E ) . In fur - ther analysis , we focused on these different genes , 28 Regulatory networks in mechanotransduction reveal key genes in promoting cancer cell stemness and . . . 6819 differentially expressed TFs and 8 cancer related continuously changed miRNAs to construct regulatory network ( Supple - mentary Fig . S3 ) . Membrane protein genes were signi ﬁ cantly affected by mechanotransduction Previous studies have shown that membrane proteins play vital roles in mechanotransduction [ 8 ] . Gene ontology ( GO ) and the pathway enrichment analyses for the 1305 DEGs ( Fig . 2a ) showed that they were signi ﬁ cantly enriched in mechanotransduction related terms such as membrane ( FDR : 4 . 45E - 51 ) , ECM ( 1 . 67E - 13 ) , and focal adhesion ( 7 . 75E - 23 ) . These results highlighted potential roles of membrane protein genes in the TRCs generation under mechanotransduction . There were 25 integrin and cell / focal adhesion related membrane genes signi ﬁ cantly changed from 2D to 3D gels ( Fig . 2b ) and part of those genes were continuously increased in the 3D gels from 12 h to 3 day , such as ANXA2 , ADAM15 , ITGA3 , ITGB5 , SLC3A2 , and GRB2 . To explore the regulation of these membrane DEGs , a TF and miRNA co - regulatory network for them were Fig . 1 Matrix softness enhances stemness genes in HeLa TRCs and differentially expressed TFs / miRNAs . a Representative images of a single HeLa cell growing into a multicellular tumor spheroid in dif - ferent stiffnesses ( 90 , 420 , or 1050 Pa ) 3D ﬁ brin gels cultured from day 1 to day 7 .

Huang et al . constructed . Membrane genes were predicted to be regu - lated by nine differentially expressed TFs and ﬁ ve miRNAs ( Fig . 2c ) . TFs MYC and STAT3 regulated nine and eight membrane genes , respectively . GRB2 is involved in the formation of focal adhesion complexes [ 19 ] and was regu - lated by STAT3 and IRF3 . ITGA3 , an integrin receptor for ﬁ bronectin , laminin , and collagen [ 20 ] , was a direct target of hsa - miR - 199a - 5p . Conversely , membrane genes can also regulate TFs , for instance , GRB2 can inhibit the STAT3 activity [ 21 ] while ANXA2 positively regulate STAT3 [ 22 ] . These results indicated membrane genes may be regulated by miRNAs or TFs during the mechanotransduction . Core regulators responsible for the changes of WNT / Hippo / TGF - β / PI3K - AKT pathways during TRCs process The mechanical stress in 3D gels will transfer through membrane to cytoplasm and alter the downstream signaling pathways . In the above analysis , we identi ﬁ ed 27 DEGs were enriched in the positive regulation of WNT ( 8 . 93E - 4 ) and the Wnt / planar cell polarity ( WNT / PCP ) pathway ( 2 . 46E - 6 ) ( Fig . 2a ) . WNT together with other three path - ways ( Hippo , PI3K - AKT , and TGF - β ) were considered as classical mechanotransduction pathways [ 11 ] .

Most DEGs in the four pathways were upregulated from 12 h to 3 day during the 3D cultured ( Fig . 3a ) . Interestingly , most TFs and miRNAs in the regulatory network of membrane genes ( Fig . 2c ) were also the common regulators in regulatory networks of these four mechanotransduction pathways ( Fig . 3b ) . Seven TFs were signi ﬁ cantly differentially expressed in the comparison of 12 h vs 0 h sample ( Fig . 3a ) and ATF4 / STAT3 / MYC have been reported to be associated with mechanotransduction or Fig . 3 Expression and regulation of genes in four classical pathways . a Expression heatmap of DEGs in four classical pathways , which are canonical Hippo , Wnt , TGF - beta , and PI3K - AKT pathways . b Common regulators of the four pathways .

Meanwhile , miRNAs were continuously decreasing from 12 h to 3 day and some were reported to inhibit tumorigenesis induced by CSCs such as miR - 186 - 5p / 199a - 5p [ 25 , 26 ] . These results showed that these TFs and miRNAs were core regulators in the four classical mechanical signaling pathways . Continuously changed cancer - related genes were regulated by TFs and miRNAs The mechanical stress transferred from membrane to downstream pathways , and then affected the expressions of downstream genes . For the affected downstream genes , we focused on the 25 continuously changed cancer - related DEGs ( Fig . 1g ) . Among them , 23 were regulated by TFs and miRNAs ( Fig . 3c ) . In the network , most genes and TFs were continuously increased while miRNAs were con - tinuously decreased from 12 h to 3 day ( Fig . 1g ) . We found that MYC as a core regulator in the network regulated half of the cancer - related genes ( 12 / 23 ) . CCT3 was regulated by the largest number of TFs such as STAT3 / MYC / MAZ / IRF3 . CCT3 promotes the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma [ 27 ] . These results suggested that TFs / miRNAs may be through the four mechanical pathways to directly or indirectly regulated cancer - related genes and thus in ﬂ uence the selection of TRCs . Enrichment analyses and integrated regulatory network revealed key regulators Previous studies have shown that the WNT pathway plays important roles in mechanotransduction [ 11 ] and our enrichment results also revealed the activation of the WNT pathway ( Fig . 3b ) . Next , we performed pathway enrichment analysis ( P < 0 . 01 , Bonferroni ) ( Fig . 4a ) for the DEGs in the WNT pathway network ( Fig . 3b ) , membrane proteins ( Fig . 2b ) , and cancer - related genes ( Fig . 3c ) to identify their pathway crosstalk . Results showed many crosstalk genes between multiple pathways . For instance , CTNNB1 and RHOA participated in WNT and focal adhesion pathways ( Fig . 4a ) , as well as cancer - related pathways . Membrane genes such as ITGB1 / ITGB5 / ITGA3 were involved in both focal adhesion and WNT pathways ( Fig . 4a ) . To identify more candidate regulators or genes in the TRCs selection for experimental validation , we constructed a combined network ( Fig . 4b ) for extending Fig . 4a . As a result , we found nine regulators ( ﬁ ve TFs and four miR - NAs ) act as crosstalk regulators involved in the regulation of membrane proteins , WNT pathways , and cancer - related genes . For example , as a key crosstalk regulator in the network , STAT3 can regulate cancer gene CCT3 , mem - brane gene ITGAE , and the WNT pathway gene CCNTB1 . In addition , we also found many genes in our network that were not available in Fig . 4a , such as CCT3 and CKS1B . Almost no studies reported the cancer - related gene CCT3 in the TRCs - screening process or CSCs , while it may play important roles in our study . These analyses provided evi - dence that genes or regulators may play vital roles in the crosstalk between mechanotransduction and cancer pro - liferation regulation . Key genes and miRNA impacting selection of TRCs Our transcriptome analysis indicated that many TFs , miRNAs , and genes involved in multiple pathways to mediate mechanotransduction and in ﬂ uence the selection of TRCs . To verify the function of genes in the 3D culture process and TRCs selection , ﬁ rstly , we validated the expression of hsa - miR - 199a - 5p in HeLa TRCs at 3 day and HeLa 2D cells as control ( Supplementary Fig . S5A ) . Herein , colony formation of HeLa TRCs was signi ﬁ cantly decreased with hsa - miR - 199a - 5p mimic . This suggested that the selection process of HeLa TRCs was inhibited by hsa - miR - 199a - 5p ( Fig . 4c – e ) , which was reported to inhibit the engraftment and repopulation capacity in liver [ 28 ] . Previous studies have shown the regulation of ITGA3 by hsa - miR - 199a - 5p inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion [ 29 ] . Our experiments showed that ectopic expression of hsa - miR - 199a - 5p led to downregulation of ITGA3 and this may reduce 3D colony formation ( Sup - plementary Fig . S5B ) . Next , results showed that the expression of TFs ( ATF4 and STAT3 ) and genes ( FLNA , RHOA , ITGA3 , CCT3 , CKS1B , and SLC3A2 ) were changed signi ﬁ cantly from HeLa 2D on rigid dish to HeLa TRCs in 3D soft ﬁ brin gels ( Fig . 4f ) . Further , after transfected siRNAs for 24 h , the TF ATF4 signi ﬁ cantly suppressed the colony growth and number ( Fig . 4g ) , which was probably through inhibition of NANOG and OCT4 expression ( Supplementary Fig . S5C ) . Transfection of CCT3 siRNA also signi ﬁ cantly reduced colony number and size ( Fig . 4g ) . But the silence of SLC3A2 increased the colony number and size ( Fig . 4g ) . These results suggested that ATF4 and CCT3 promoted the selection of HeLa TRCs , while SLC3A2 suppressed it . CCT3 promoted cell proliferation and stemness in vitro , while its suppression inhibited TRCs - induced tumor formation To further investigate the function of CCT3 in cancer , we constructed pcDNA 3 . 1 - CCT3 plasmid to overexpressing CCT3 and silencing CCT3 with siRNA and shRNA . The transfection of pcDNA 3 . 1 - CCT3 or CCT3 RNAi sig - ni ﬁ cantly induces or reduces CCT3 expression detected by immuno ﬂ uorescence ( Supplementary Fig . S6A ) . Then we sequenced the mRNAs of samples of CCT3 overexpression , Regulatory networks in mechanotransduction reveal key genes in promoting cancer cell stemness and . . . 6823 CCT3 RNAi and negative control ( NC ) HeLa cells and ﬁ ltered out 260 or 520 DEGs ( Fig . 5a ) when compared CCT3 overexpression or CCT3 RNAi with NC . A large number of upregulated genes after CCT3 overexpressed were signi ﬁ cantly enriched in cell proliferation - related pathways such as cell cycle whereas downregulated genes 6824 W . Huang et al . enriched in the metabolic pathway ( Fig . 5b , Supplementary Fig . S7 ) , implying that CCT3 may participate in the cell cycle pathway to promote cancer proliferation . To verify the cancer proliferation ability of CCT3 , we used HeLa cell and Bel7402 cell . Overexpression of CCT3 promoted cell pro - liferation signi ﬁ cantly and its silencing suppressed pro - liferation . Cotransfected both pcDNA 3 . 1 - CCT3 and CCT3 siRNA silenced the promoting proliferation ability of CCT3 . ( Fig . 5c , d , left ) . These showed CCT3 - promoted proliferation in 2D cell lines . Then we seeded these trans - fected cells into 90 Pa ﬁ brin gels to study what will happen in 3D . We calculated both colony number and colony size of HeLa TRCs and Bel7402 TRCs at day 1 and day 3 ( Fig . 5c , d , middle and right ) . Colony size of these TRCs had no signi ﬁ cant difference , but colony numbers were sig - ni ﬁ cantly impacted . With CCT3 overexpression , colony numbers changed from 22 to 97 at day 1 in HeLa TRCs , which means the TRCs ratio signi ﬁ cantly enhanced with CCT3 overexpression . Silencing CCT3 in the process markedly decreased the TRCs colony numbers . These suggest that CCT3 is indispensable for proliferation of HeLa and Bel7402 TRCs . Is CCT3 important in the other cancer types ? We turned to the cancer genome data ( TCGA ) and found that CCT3 was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in 12 cancer types ( BLCA , BRCA , LUAD , etc . ) of 14 cancer types with paired cancer and adjacent samples ( Fig . 5e ) . High level of CCT3 was signi ﬁ cantly associated with poor prognosis in patients of six cancers such as liver cancer ( LIHC ) and kidney cancer ( KIRP ) ( Fig . 5f , Supplementary Fig . S6B ) , which was consistent with the previous reports [ 27 , 30 ] . Taken toge - ther , these results suggest a cancer - promoting role of CCT3 in different kinds of cancers . After verifying the CCT3 functions in promoting cell proliferation and TRCs selection , we further investigated whether CCT3 is related to cancer cell stemness or not . Results of stemness enrichment analysis for DEGs from CCT3 overexpression or silencing separately showed that they were both enriched in stemness - related terms such as embryonic stem cells and E2F4 target gene sets etc . ( Fig . 6a ) . Besides , the results of side population ( SP ) cells ( stem - like cell population ) analysis showed that there were more SP cells ( 3 . 85 % ) in CCT3 overexpression cells , but less ( 0 . 14 % ) in shCCT3 cells ( Fig . 6b ) . The mRNA levels of some reported cancer stemness markers like CD133 , ETV4 , E2F4 , and KRT8 were upregulated with CCT3 overexpression ( Fig . 6c ) . CD133 , KRT8 , and ZFX were downregulated with CCT3 silencing . And their proteins were in higher expression in both HeLa and Bel7402 TRCs than their 2D cells , which were consistent with CCT3 protein ( Fig . 6d ) . Next , we constructed a subcutaneous xenotransplantation tumor model to study the CCT3 role in tumorigenesis in vivo ( Fig . 6e – g ) . TRCs showed higher tumorigenesis than 2D cells , but TRCs + shCCT3 reduced the TRCs tumorigenesis ability . Low levels of CCT3 inhibited TRCs proliferation in vivo . All these suggest that CCT3 is a cancer stemness - related gene . Discussion Many studies have shown that matrix and cell adhesion will change cell phenotype . Previous studies have reported that matrix softness such as soft 3D cell culture has substantial impacts on cell stemness [ 5 ] . However , how the matrix stress in ﬂ uences the gene expression and regulation is unclear . In this study , we applied high - throughput sequen - cing and regulatory network analysis , followed by experi - mental validation to explore transcriptome changes and the regulatory mechanism of matrix mechanic - induced TRC formation in cancer cells . We demonstrated that the ECM affects membrane proteins by force and lead to the change of downstream TFs , which regulate downstream WNT / TGF - β / PI3K - AKT pathways to affect many cancer - related genes and affect the selection of TRCs ( Fig . 7 ) . We have identi ﬁ ed and validated several molecules including TF ATF4 , transmembrane protein SLC3A2 , a potential new stemness - related gene CCT3 , and hsa - miR - 199a - 5p , which are important in mechanotransduction and affect TRCs selection process . Our transcriptome results revealed that many genes were signi ﬁ cantly changed when cells were transferred from 2D rigid to 3D soft environment ( expression levels of experi - mentally validated genes and miRNA in sequencing data were shown in Supplementary Table S1 ) . Functional ana - lysis showed that many DEGs were enriched in the WNT pathway and the WNT / PCP subpathway .

RHOA was regulated by MYC and MAZ which suggests the WNT pathway may be regulated by key TFs and participate in mechanotransduction . We have identi ﬁ ed seven TFs regulated the Hippo / Wnt / TGF - beta / PI3K - AKT mechanical transduction pathways ( Fig . 3b ) . TFs such as ATF4 / MYC / STAT3 have been stu - died in mechanotransduction [ 23 , 34 ] . MAZ can induce the differentiation of neural stem cells [ 35 ] . YBX1 can bind NANOG to affect the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells [ 36 ] , and also regulates SOX2 , which is a self - renewal gene highly expressed in melanoma TRCs [ 4 ] and Hela TRCs , thus to maintain the stemness of breast cancer and tumori - genic properties [ 37 ] . These TFs potentially build a bridge between the mechanical transduction and cell stemness . Further multi - networks integration analyses ( Fig . 4b ) pro - vided opportunities to identify key regulators / genes in the crosstalk of these functions . The colony formation data in Fig . 4 showed that ATF4 and CCT3 promoted the TRCs selection process , while SLC3A2 and hsa - miR - 199a - 5p suppressed it . ATF4 as an important TF plays a pivotal role in the development of functional of mice hematopoietic stem cells [ 38 ] and relates to the drug resistance in tumor therapy [ 39 ] . ATF4 is also reported to confer a survival advantage for tumor cells under hypoxia and regulate tumor progression [ 40 ] . In accordance with the published reports , our results show that ATF4 promotes the generation and maintenance of TRCs and may be a tumor therapeutic target . CCT3 is reported to promote cell proliferation and invasion of HCC cells [ 27 ] and to be regulated by STAT3 [ 41 ] . However , few studies about the CCT3 function on stemness were found . Our work identi ﬁ ed that CCT3 may take part in the cell cycle pathway to promote proliferation of HeLa cells ( Fig . 5b ) . MAD2L1 is an integral part of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint gene to ensure mitosis Fig . 7 Schematic summary of the membrane pathway cancer mediated by TFs / miRNAs during the selection of TRCs . The membrane proteins affected by force from extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and lead to the change of downstream genes such as STAT3 and MYBL2 . These TFs involved in the regulation of WNT / TGF - β / PI3K - AKT pathways and affected the expression of downstream cancer - related genes such as CCT3 . CCT3 , then affected the selection of TRCs 6828 W . Huang et al . [ 42 ] , and was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated after increasing CCT3 , consistent with the report that CCT3 affects mitotic process [ 27 ] . CCT3 overexpression and silencing affect a large number of stemness genes ( Fig . 6a ) and common stemness marker genes , such as CD133 , ETV4 , E2F4 , KRT8 , and SOX2 ( Fig . 6c ) . It had been reported that the majority of SP cells showed CD133 + phenotype [ 43 ] . CCT3 overexpression cells perform both CD133 + and high SP fraction , while CCT3 - silencing cells perform CD133 downregulation and low - SP fraction ( Fig . 6b , c ) . The stemness genes were upregulated along with CCT3 upre - gulation in TRCs ( Fig . 6d ) . These indicate that CCT3 may be a stemness - related gene . In addition , SLC3A2 has been reported to interact with integrins on cell membrane [ 44 ] . SLC3A2 can activate the ROCK activity through RHOA ( Fig . 7 ) and result in an increase in transcription mediated by YAP / TAZ , which is a nuclear relay signal for mechan - otransduction [ 44 ] . In contrast , we found that SLC3A2 suppressed the formation and growth of TRCs ( Fig . 4g ) , suggesting that SLC3A2 may be an inhibitor of self - renewal and stemness of tumor cells . Does the ﬁ brin gel arti ﬁ cially promote TRCs ? Whenever an assay or a probe is introduced into a biological system , there is always a possibility that this assay or probe might perturb the system and causes unwanted changes to the system . Therefore , we cannot rule out the possibility that the ﬁ brin gels are arti ﬁ cially promoting TRCs . However , a published report reveals that in human malignant tumors ﬁ brin is found in connective tissue stroma [ 45 ] . Further - more , it is known that the survival and metastatic potential of circulating tumor cells are elevated by ﬁ brin and ﬁ bri - nogen [ 46 ] . In addition , lung metastasis is enhanced by ﬁ brin and ﬁ bronectin complexes [ 47 ] and ﬁ brinogen depletion reduces tumor formation in the mouse lung [ 48 ] . All these ﬁ ndings suggest that the soft ﬁ brin environment is physiological relevant in tumor . We performed GATK work ﬂ ow [ 49 ] for SNP and indel calling on RNA - seq data of HeLa 2D sample ( 0 h sample ) , and four TRCs samples ( 12 h , 1 day , 3 day , and 5 day samples ) . When compared with HeLa 2D samples , we identi ﬁ ed changes at 1065 mutation sites on 839 protein - coding genes in all TRCs samples . Almost all ( 97 . 2 % ) of these mutation sites were lost in TRCs samples and only 29 mutation sites were added in TRCs samples . These suggest that more mutation sites disappear in the TRCs . However , at the present time , we do not know what the exact sig - ni ﬁ cance of these mutations is for TRCs when compared with 2D cells . To further investigate biological functions of genes with mutation changes from 2D to TRCs , we per - formed the KEGG pathway , GO , and stemness enrichment analyses for the 839 genes ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . The results showed that these genes were signi ﬁ cantly enriched in differentiation , migration , proliferation , self - renewing , and stemness - related terms ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . Although a large number of genes were associated with cancer growth terms ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) , only 83 mutation sites have clinical disease - related studies , and only three mutation sites have been reported to be associated with cancer by literature search . A frameshift variant ( c . 4666dup , dbSNP id : rs587783031 ) and a missense var - iant ( c . 5465T > G , dbSNP id : rs459552 ) of APC gene were related with hereditary cancer - predisposing syndrome [ 50 ] . A frameshift variant ( c . 623dupA , dbSNP id : rs587780033 ) of BARD1 was found in breast cancer [ 51 ] . Clearly addi - tional studies are needed to explore the relationship between other mutation sites and tumors . In conclusion , in this study , we performed transcriptome data analysis and validation of TRCs from the 3D culture . We systematically investigated the gene expression alteration and regulation in mechanotransduction , including membrane protein genes , downstream mechanotransduction related sig - naling pathways , and cancer - related genes ( Fig . 7 ) . The cur - rent study provides us a deeper understanding of how matrix softness impacts cancer cell selection and fate via mechan - otransduction pathways and regulators . This provides new insights into the CSCs initiation and cancer progression . Materials and methods Cell lines and cell culture Human cervical cancer cell line HeLa was kept by our laboratory and had STR tested by CCTCC ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Human hepatocarcinoma cell line Bel7402 was purchased from China Center for Type Culture Collection ( CCTCC , Wuhan , China ) . Cells were cultured on the plastic plate in DMEM ( high glucose Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , and 100 mg / ml penicillin / streptomycin at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . The cells were randomly assigned to each experimental group and the potential presence of myco - plasma was monitored via continuous microscopic imaging . HeLa 3D preparation HeLa cells were digested with trypsin ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) from the 2D plastic plate , then were divided into single - cell solution . Fibrinogen was diluted into 2 , 8 , or 16 mg / ml with T7 buffer ( pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM Tris , and 150 mM NaCl ) . Cell plus ﬁ brinogen mixture was made by mix the same volume of single - cell solution and ﬁ brinogen solution . Finally , the mixture ’ s concentration [ 4 ] is 1 , 4 , or 8 mg / ml ﬁ brin gels ( corresponding stiffness is 90 , 420 , and 1050 Pa , respectively ) . For colony number experiment , 50 μ l cell and ﬁ brinogen mixtures were seeded into each well of 96 - Regulatory networks in mechanotransduction reveal key genes in promoting cancer cell stemness and . . . 6829 well plate and mixed well with preadded 1 μ l thrombin ( 100 U / ml ) . And 250 μ l cell plus ﬁ brinogen mixture was seeded into each well of 24 - well plate with 5 μ l thrombin for total RNA extraction . The cell culture plate was then incu - bated in 37 °C cell culture incubator for 25 min . Finally , DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum and antibiotics was added with quadruple volume of the mixture . Real - time qPCR analysis Cells were lysed with TRIzol ™ reagent ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , and total RNA was isolated according to the TRIzol ™ Reagent User Guide ( https : / / www . thermo ﬁ sher . com / ) . Reverse transcription was performed using the TransScript First - strand cDNA Synthesis Super Mix ( TransGen Biotech , Beijing , China ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) was performed using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix ( Promega , Madison , MI , USA ) . All mRNA expression was normalized to human glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehy - drogenase ( GAPDH ) . Sequences of all the primers for real - time qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table S3 . All pri - mers were designed by Primer Premier 6 , and synthesis by TSINGKE ( Beijing , China ) . The expression of miRNA was detected by All - in - One ™ miRNA qRT - PCR Detection kit ( GeneCopoeia ™ , Guangz - hou , China ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . All miRNA expression was normalized to hsa - U6 . Transfection Cells were transfected with small - interfering RNA ( siRNA ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) as manufacturer ’ s instructions . The NC siRNA , siRNA duplexes and shRNA were synthesized from Gen - ephama Biotech ( Shanghai , China ) . All the siRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S4 , all shRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S5 . Silence ef ﬁ ciencies were shown in Supplementary Figs . S5D and 6A . CCT3 expression construct was generated by sub - cloning PCR - ampli ﬁ ed full - length human CCT3 cDNA into the pcDNA3 . 1 plasmid . Hsa - miR - 199a - 5p mimic , speci ﬁ c inhibitor molecules , and appropriate NC molecules were purchased from Gen - ephama Biotech ( Shanghai , China ) . All the mimic , inhibitor or NC molecules were transfected using X - treme GENE siRNA Transfection Reagent ( Roche , Germany ) , based on the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Colony number assay and colony size calculate By changing the focal planes according to the direction of gel depth , the colony number was counted view by view using optical microscope ( MDIL - LED , Leica , Germany ) . At least three wells of colonies were counted per condition . The colony photograph was taken by using an inverted ﬂ uorescence microscope ( DMI6000B , Leica , German ) . The area ( S ) of each colony was measured by using ImageJ , and then the size ( V ) was calculated by using the formula : V ¼ 43 (cid:2) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð s 3 = π Þ p . Migration and invasion assay HeLa 3D was digested by collagenase and dispase II mix - ture in 37 °C to dissolve the ﬁ brin gels and divided the colonies into the single - cell suspension . For the migration assay , 4 × 10 4 cells in serum - free medium were seed in the upper compartment of an 8 μ m transwell chamber ( Corning , NY , USA ) . For the invasion assay , the upper chambers were previously coated with ECM gel ( Corning , NY , USA ) . After incubation for 24 – 48 h , the migrated or invaded cells on the lower membrane were stained with 4 % paraf - ormaldehyde , then stained with 0 . 1 % crystal violet . The upper cells were moved gently by the soft medical cotton ball . Each group random took ten pictures under a micro - scope with ×400 magni ﬁ cation ( Olympus , Japan ) . Cell numbers per ﬁ eld were calculated by ImageJ . Data source HeLa cells cultured in the rigid plastic plate were marked as HeLa 2D , and in 90 Pa ﬁ brin gels were marked as HeLa 3D . The cells before cultured into ﬁ brin gels were collected with TRIzol ™ Regent as 0 h . HeLa 3D cells were collected with TRIzol Regent in a row at four time points : 12 h , 1 day ( 24 h ) , 3 day ( 72 h ) , and 5 day ( 120 h ) . All samples have carried out high - throughput sequencing : RNA - Seq ( PE150 ) and miRNA - Seq ( SE50 ) via Illumina HiSeqTM4000 plat - form by BGI - shenzhen ( Wuhan , China ) . We obtained 12 . 5 million clean reads for miRNA and 80 million clean reads for RNA of each sample . RNA - Seq reads were mapped to Ensembl v81 ( GRCH38 ) and processed by the HISAT2 - StringTie - ballgown pipeline [ 52 ] . miRNA - Seq reads were to map the miRNA precursor sequence to get known miRNA expression based on our previous pipeline [ 53 ] . We used FPKM ( Fragments Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads ) and RPM ( Reads Per Million ) to calculate gene and miRNA expression levels , separately . Differentially expressed genes We used bioconductor - package NOISeq [ 54 ] to screen DEGs or DEMs . Differentiation analysis was performed on genes or miRNAs that expressed more than 20 ( FPKM / RPM ) in any sample . Genes or miRNAs with prob > 0 . 99 and | Fold Change | ≥ 2 were considered as signi ﬁ cant DEGs / 6830 W . Huang et al . DEMs . Differentiation analysis of CCT3 overexpression or CCT3 RNAi compare with control were also performed by NOISeq with cutoff prob > 0 . 7 and | Fold Change | ≥ 1 . 5 . All of the heatmaps were visualized by software MeV ( http : / / en . bio - soft . net / chip / MeV . html ) . All genes were normalized by row and hierarchical clustering was performed by cal - culating Euclidean distance . Quanti ﬁ cation of continuously altered genes Because of the drastic changes in gene expression between HeLa 2D and HeLa 3D , we just considered the genes whose expression levels continuously increased or decreased from 12 h to 5 day and the fold change of 5 day versus 12 h was larger than 1 . 5 times as continuously increased / decreased gene . miRNAs whose expression continuously increased / decreased from 0 h to 3 day and the fold change of 3 day versus 0 h was higher than 1 . 5 times were considered as continuously increased or decreased miRNAs . We collected the stemness genes / miRNAs from pieces of literature and intersected them with continuously altered genes or miR - NAs for further analysis . Enrichment and stemness signi ﬁ cance analysis GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of all DEGs were achieved by online tool DAVID [ 55 ] ( https : / / david . ncifcrf . gov / ) ( FDR ≤ 0 . 01 ) . KEGG enrichment analysis for genes in the integrated network in Fig . 6c was based on the Cytos - cape plug - in ClueGO ( http : / / apps . cytoscape . org / apps / cluego ) [ 56 ] ( P ≤ 0 . 01 ) . The stemness enrichment analyses were carried out by StemChecker database ( http : / / stemchecker . sysbiolab . eu / , P ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Regulatory networks Construction of regulatory networks utilizes interaction data collected in the previous work [ 13 ] , including experimental and predicted TF - target / miRNA and miRNA - target / TF . We constructed the membrane protein network using differen - tially expressed membrane genes , differentially expressed TFs and 29 key DEMs , which are at the intersection of 3D vs 2D different miRNAs and continuously altered miRNAs . Combined the differentially expressed TFs ( Fig . 1g ) , DEGs ( differed between 0 h ( HeLa 2D ) and 12 h ( HeLa 3D ) ) , and key DEMs , we constructed the four classical pathway net - works in the KEGG pathway ( http : / / www . kegg . jp / kegg / ) . Variants identi ﬁ cation In this study , we used the best practices work ﬂ ow by GATK [ 49 ] to detect SNP and indel on RNA - Seq data . First , we used STAR 2 - pass alignment with the default parameters mapping to Ensembl v81 ( GRCH38 ) and used Picard to add group information to the mapping result SAM ﬁ les . Then , we used GATK tool ( version 3 . 7 ) [ 49 ] to split “ N ” Trim and reassign - mapping qualities . Finally , we used the recom - mended HaplotypeCaller in GATK to perform variant calling and used ANNOVAR [ 57 ] to annotate mutations .

Cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation was measured with the Cell - Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) assay kit ( Dojindo Corp . , Japan ) . HeLa 2D cells or Bel7402 2D cells were seeded in 96 - well plates ( 8 × 10 3 cells / well ) . Empty vectors , pcDNA 3 . 1 - CCT3 or RNAi were transfected for 24 h ( HeLa ) and 48 h ( Bel7402 ) .
