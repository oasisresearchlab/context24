Arterial sti ﬀ ness , which increases with aging and hypertension , is an independent cardiovascular risk factor . While sti ﬀ er substrates are known to a ﬀ ect single endothelial cell morphology and migration , the e ﬀ ect of substrate sti ﬀ ness on endothelial monolayer function is less understood . The objective of this study was to determine if substrate sti ﬀ ness increased endothelial monolayer reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in response to protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation and if this oxidative stress then impacted adherens junction integrity . Porcine aortic endothelial cells were cultured on varied sti ﬀ ness polyacrylamide gels and treated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , which stimulates PKC and ROS without increasing actinomyosin contractility . PMA - treated endothelial cells on sti ﬀ er substrates increased ROS and adherens junction loss without increased contractility . ROS scavengers abrogated PMA e ﬀ ects on cell - cell junctions , with a more profound e ﬀ ect in cells on sti ﬀ er substrates . Finally , endothelial cells in aortae from elastin haploinsu ﬃ cient mice ( Eln + / - ) , which were sti ﬀ er than aortae from wild - type mice , showed decreased VE - cadherin colocalization with peripheral actin following PMA treatment . These data suggest that oxidative stress may be enhanced in endothelial cells in sti ﬀ er vessels , which could contribute to the association between arterial sti ﬀ ness and cardiovascular disease . 1 . Introduction Due to the highly mechanical nature of the cardiovascular system , cardiovascular disease has long been accepted as both a biomechanical and biochemical disease . Arterial sti ﬀ ness , which increases with hypertension and aging among others , is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk [ 1 – 3 ] . Arteries reversibly sti ﬀ en when smooth muscle cells contract and irreversibly sti ﬀ en as elastin is degraded and collagen increases [ 4 – 9 ] . Sti ﬀ arteries have long been known to con - tribute to cardiovascular mortality by increasing cardiac afterload [ 10 ] ; more recently , sti ﬀ arteries have also been shown to contribute to endothelial dysfunction , an initiat - ing step in atherosclerosis [ 11 – 13 ] . In vitro , endothelial monolayers on sti ﬀ polyacrylamide ( PA ) gels were more permeable [ 12 , 14 , 15 ] . In animal models , endothelial per - meability was elevated in sti ﬀ ened aortae from older mice [ 12 ] . Mesenteric arteries from elastin haploinsu ﬃ cient ( Eln + / - ) mice had enhanced angiotensin - induced vasocon - striction and impaired endothelium - dependent vasodilation [ 13 ] , although aortae from these same animals do not [ 16 ] . In human subjects , endothelial ﬂ ow - mediated vasodilation was inversely correlated with aortic sti ﬀ ness [ 17 , 18 ] . Thus , arterial sti ﬀ ness alone may contribute to cardiovascular risk by altering critical endothelial functions . However , cardiovascular risk factors rarely occur in isola - tion but rather cluster in certain individuals . Little is known about how arterial sti ﬀ ness interacts with other cardiovascu - lar risk factors such as diabetes and in ﬂ ammation . Both hyperglycemia and in ﬂ ammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor - α ( TNF - α ) increase endothelial cell oxidative stress due to increased production and decreased scavenging of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Elevated ROS have been implicated in both hypertension and atherosclerosis patho - genesis [ 19 ] . ROS are a family of highly reactive oxygen - containing molecules , including superoxide ( O 2 - ) , hydrogen HindawiApplied Bionics and Biomechanics Volume 2019 , Article ID 6578492 , 14 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2019 / 6578492 peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , hydroxyl radical ( ⋅ OH ) , and peroxynitrite ( ONOO - ) , which play an important role in many signaling pathways , such as cell proliferation , survival , and metabolism [ 20 ] . Superoxide is produced by the mitochondrial electron transport chain , as well as through protein kinase C - ( PKC - ) induced NADPH oxidase upregulation and activation [ 21 – 23 ] . NADPH oxidase assembly at the cell membrane requires Rac , which is enhanced by substrate sti ﬀ ness [ 24 ] . The e ﬀ ect of arterial sti ﬀ ness on endothelial ROS produc - tion in response to an external stimulus such as hyperglyce - mia or TNF - α has not yet been investigated . However , these risk factors also activate many other endothelial cell sig - naling pathways . Therefore , to isolate substrate sti ﬀ ness e ﬀ ects on endothelial ROS production , we used phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , a PKC activator widely used to stimulate ROS production in vitro . In previous studies , PMA treatment increased endothelial monolayer permeability but did not increase actinomyosin contractility , as measured by silicon substrate wrinkling , myosin light chain ( MLC ) phosphorylation , or MLC kinase activation [ 25 , 26 ] . Phorbol esters may instead induce barrier loss through intermediate ﬁ lament or actin cytoskeleton reorganization [ 27 – 29 ] . Thus , PMA enables investigation of substrate sti ﬀ ness e ﬀ ects on ROS production without stimulating actinomyosin contractility . We hypothesized that sti ﬀ substrates would increase endothelial ROS in response to PMA , resulting in actin ﬁ ber formation and cell - cell junction loss . We used varied sti ﬀ ness PA gels to study PMA - induced endothelial ROS , actin ﬁ ber formation , and adherens junction loss . Abdominal aortae from wild - type ( WT ) and Eln + / - mice were treated with PMA ex vivo and imaged en face . We now show that sub - strate sti ﬀ ness enhances PMA - induced oxidative stress in endothelial monolayers in vitro and alters actin ﬁ ber reorga - nization and adherens junction morphology both in vitro and ex vivo . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Animals . All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Drexel University College of Medicine Animal Studies Committee . Eln + / - mice were generated as previously described [ 30 ] . 8 - 12 - week - old WT and Eln + / - mice of both sexes , backcrossed several generations into the C57BL / 6 background ( Charles River ) , were used . All mice were genotyped to con ﬁ rm elastin het - erozygosity , and decreased elastin lamellae thickness was con ﬁ rmed in select animals by immunohistochemistry . Mice were provided access to food and water ad libitum at 22 ° C and a 12 - hour light / dark cycle . 2 . 2 . Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) . AFM was used to quan - tify aortic sti ﬀ ness in wild - type ( WT ) and Eln + / - mouse aor - tae . The aorta was dissected and transferred to ice - cold HEPES bu ﬀ er ( 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 . 2 mM MgSO 4 , 1 . 2 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM sodium acetate , and 5 mM glucose , pH 7 . 4 ) . Excess tissue was cleaned from the outside of the vessel , and the vessel was cut open longitudinally to expose the endothelium . Each aorta was cut into four segments — two thoracic segments and two abdominal segments — producing four samples per aorta . Samples were carefully mounted , the endothelium facing up , on a coverslip using Loctite 401 medical grade adhesive ( Henkel ) and submersed in PBS . The endothelium was removed by gentle scraping with a cotton - tip applicator , based on a published protocol [ 31 ] . Subendothelial sti ﬀ ness was determined by AFM using precalibrated cantilevers ( spring constants between 0 . 10 and 0 . 17 N / m ) with 10 μ m spherical tips . Between three and nine indentations were made at di ﬀ erent locations along each sample . The force - indentation curve for each indentation was ﬁ t to the Hertz model down to 200 nm indentation using a custom MATLAB code to produce a sti ﬀ ness value [ 32 ] . Subendothe - lial sti ﬀ ness was calculated as the average of the individual sti ﬀ ness values of each sample . 2 . 3 . Cell Culture and Polyacrylamide ( PA ) Gel Sample Preparation . Primary porcine aortic endothelial cells ( PAEC ) were isolated by the collagenase dispersion method and cul - tured in low glucose Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM , Corning ) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , HyClone ) , 1 % glutamine , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were used up to passage 9 . 6 , 14 , or 29kPa was selected for the PA gel sti ﬀ nesses based on the subendothelial sti ﬀ nesses measured in WT and Eln + / - mouse aorta ( Figure 1 ) . PA gels were prepared following well - established protocols [ 33 , 34 ] . Brie ﬂ y , a bot - tom coverslip was made hydrophilic by consecutive incuba - tions with 0 . 1 M sodium hydroxide ( NaOH , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysiliane ( 3 - APTES , Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . A top coverslip was made hydrophobic by applying SurfaSil ( 1 , 7 - dichloro - octamethyltetrasiloxane , Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . A solution containing varying amounts of 40 % acrylamide and 2 % bisacrylamide ( Bio - Rad ) was prepared based on the desired gel sti ﬀ ness ( Table 1 ) . Ammonium persulfate ( Bio - Rad ) and tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED , Bio - Rad ) were added to the acrylamide / bisacrylamide solution to achieve ﬁ nal concentrations of 0 . 1 % w / v and 0 . 3 % v / v , respectively , initiating gel polymerization . Polymerizing gel solution was added to the bottom coverslip , and the top coverslip was quickly inverted onto the polymerizing gel to create a ﬂ at surface . After gel formation , the top cover - slip was removed . Elastic modulus was con ﬁ rmed by AFM . To make the surface adhesive to cells , the gel was UV - activated using sulfo - SANPAH ( Thermo Fisher ) in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO , Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and 50mM HEPES bu ﬀ er and then incubated with 100 μ g / mL type I collagen ( BD Biosciences ) at 37 ° C for 3 hours at room temperature or at 4 ° C overnight . The collagen - coated gel was rinsed in sterile phosphate - bu ﬀ ered saline ( PBS ) and UV - sterilized prior to cell seeding . PAEC were seeded on collagen - coated PA gels in phenol red - free DMEM and cultured to con ﬂ uence for three days in a growth medium . Cells were then serum - starved overnight in phenol red - free DMEM containing 1 % FBS , 1 % glutamine , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin . After serum starvation , cells were left untreated or treated with 1 μ M PMA for varying 2 Applied Bionics and Biomechanics durations . In some cases , endothelial monolayers were pre - treated with ROS scavengers ( 4 mM N - acetyl cysteine or 50 mM sodium pyruvate , Sigma ) for 1 hour prior to PMA . 2 . 4 . ROS Assay . ROS were measured using 5 - ( and - 6 ) - chloromethyl - 2 ′ , 7 ′ - dichlorodihydro ﬂ uorescein diacetate ( CM - H 2 DCFDA ) , which passively di ﬀ uses into cells where it is cleaved by intracellular esterases and then oxidized by Abdominal Thoracic ( a ) U n s c r a p e d S c r a p e d ( b ) ( c ) Figure 1 : Subendothelial sti ﬀ ness increased in the thoracic and abdominal aortae of Eln + / - mice .

( c ) Subendothelial sti ﬀ ness of aortae from WT and Eln + / - mice . Thoracic and abdominal aortic sections were indented by AFM using a silicon nitride cantilever with a 10 μ m spherical tip to measure subendothelial sti ﬀ ness ( ∗ p < 0 01 and # p < 0 05 by Student ’ s t - test ) . Three aortae were tested for each condition . Table 1 : Acrylamide and bisacrylamide concentrations used to create varying elastic modulus PA gels .

After PMA or tBHP treatment , samples were rinsed with warmed HBSS bu ﬀ er ( 0 . 137 M NaCl , 5 . 4 mM KCl , 0 . 25 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 5 . 6 mM glucose , 0 . 44 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 . 3 mM CaCl 2 , 1 . 0 mM MgSO 4 , and 4 . 2 mM NaHCO 3 ) . 25 μ M CM - H 2 DCFDA in phenol red - free DMEM was added to each sample and incubated for 25 minutes at 37 ° C , protected from light . To label nuclei , bisbenzimide ( 0 . 2 μ g / mL , Thermo Fisher ) was added to each sample for an additional 5 minutes . After thorough washing in HBSS bu ﬀ er , samples were immersed in warmed phenol red - free DMEM and imaged in an Olympus Fluoview 1000 microscope as confocal z - stacks ( 1 μ m step size ) . 2 . 5 . Confocal Microscopy and Image Analysis . Endothelial cells on PA gels were imaged by confocal microscopy and analyzed using MATLAB . In vitro cell samples were rinsed once with ice - cold PBS and ﬁ xed with ice - cold 4 % parafor - maldehyde . Samples were then permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 minutes and blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS for 1 hour at room tem - perature . After ﬁ xation , mouse aortae were simultaneously blocked and permeabilized in PBS containing 1 % BSA and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 . Endothelial cells on PA gels were labeled with primary antibodies for VE - cadherin ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz ) , β - catenin ( 1 : 200 , Thermo Fisher ) , or pMLC ( 1 : 200 , Cell Signaling ) in 1 % BSA in PBS overnight at 4 ° C . After sev - eral rinses with PBS , samples were then incubated with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488 or 633 ( 1 : 200 , Thermo Fisher ) secondary antibody , rhodamine phalloidin ( 16 . 5 nM , Invitrogen ) , and bisbenzimide ( 0 . 2 μ g / mL ) for 1 hour at room temperature , protected from light . Samples were rinsed twice with PBS and mounted in 1 : 1 glycerol : PBS . Confocal z - stacks were acquired for all samples with either a 0 . 25 or 0 . 5 μ m step size ( for in vitro and ex vivo samples , respec - tively ) using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal micro - scope at 60x magni ﬁ cation . A custom MATLAB code was created to quantify ROS and pMLC . The background was subtracted using a 50 × 50 pixel area . Images were then binarized using the same thresh - old as determined using Otsu ’ s method , which calculates a threshold based on pixel intensity distribution [ 35 ] . Noise was removed from binarized images by excluding small objects ( less than 9 pixels for ROS , less than 30 pixels for pMLC ) . The number of remaining pixels with intensities above the threshold ( “ positive ” pixels ) was counted for each image . Three images per sample were quanti ﬁ ed using this method and averaged to quantify ROS or pMLC in each sample . 2 . 6 . PKC Activity Assay . After treatment , cells on PA gels were quickly rinsed with ice - cold PBS and inverted onto 50 μ L lysis bu ﬀ er ( 20 mM MOPS , 50 mM β - glycerophos - phate , 50 mM sodium ﬂ uoride , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % NP40 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM benzamidine , 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂ uoride , 10 μ g / mL leupeptin , and 10 μ g / mL aprotinin ) for 10 minutes at 4 ° C . Lysed cells were then scraped from the gel substrates , collected in prechilled Eppendorf tubes , and centrifuged at 4 ° C for 15 minutes at 13 , 000 rpm . The supernatant was col - lected , and the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay ( Thermo Fisher ) . PKC activity was quanti ﬁ ed in control or treated cell lysates using an ELISA - based PKC kinase assay ( Enzo ) as per the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Absorbance ( 450 nm ) was measured on a microplate reader ( Thermo LabSystems , Multiskan Spectrum ) . Relative kinase activity was calculated as follows : Relative kinase activity = Average absorbance sample − Average absorbance blank Quantity of crude protein used per assay 1 2 . 7 . Statistical Analysis . All statistical analyses were conducted using MATLAB ’ s statistical toolbox . Graphs represent mean ± standard deviation . Multiple groups were compared using either two - way or n - way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey - Kramer test , and two groups were compared by Student ’ s t - test . Within each PKC assay , conditions were tested in duplicate . For ROS measurement , conditions were tested in triplicate . All experiments were conducted at least two times , with at least three samples per condition . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Subendothelial Sti ﬀ ness Was Higher in Eln + / - as Compared to WT Mouse Aorta . Macroscale arterial sti ﬀ ness , measured by pulse wave velocity or pressure myography , increases in mice genetically engineered to produce less elastin ( Eln + / - ) [ 36 , 37 ] . However , aortic sti ﬀ ness had not been characterized by atomic force microscopy in this mouse model . The longitudinally dissected mouse aorta ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) shows the mounting technique and the thoracic and abdominal sections . Aortae with the intact endothelium were ﬁ rst labeled for β - catenin ( green ) to show endothelial cell - cell junctions , actin ( red ) and nuclei ( blue ) to highlight cell structure , and collagen IV ( white ) to view the basement membrane ( Figure 1 ( b ) , top ) . When we removed the endo - thelium from the longitudinally dissected mouse aortae , we no longer observed β - catenin , con ﬁ rming that cells were removed . The collagen IV layer remained intact and contig - uous , indicating that the subendothelial matrix remained intact ( Figure 1 ( b ) , bottom ; collagen IV integrity was most clear in the cross - sectional image ) . However , it is possible that endothelial removal did damage the subendothelial layer , as evidenced by the spaces in the ﬂ uorescently labeled samples . We therefore repeated the atomic force microscopy in both scraped and unscraped WT mouse aortae and found no di ﬀ erence in aortic sti ﬀ ness measurements . When aortic samples were indented by AFM , the thoracic and abdominal aortic subendothelium from Eln + / - mice was about 1 . 75 - fold sti ﬀ er than that of WT mice ( Figure 1 ( c ) ) . The thoracic aorta was consistently sti ﬀ er than the abdominal aorta in both genotypes . 4 Applied Bionics and Biomechanics 3 . 2 . PMA - Induced Increased Oxidative Stress in Endothelial Cells on the Sti ﬀ est PA Gels . We then created 6 , 14 , and 29 kPa PA gels , which correspond to aortic sti ﬀ nesses in WT and Eln + / - mice , to determine if di ﬀ erent ROS levels were produced by PMA - treated endothelial monolayers cultured on substrates of varied sti ﬀ ness . Each sample was treated with 1 μ M PMA for 10 minutes , based on preliminary experiments showing maximum cell viability and ROS at this dose and time , and consistently imaged by confocal micros - copy . ROS were statistically similar following PMA treatment of cells on 6 and 14 kPa gels . In addition , endothelial cells on sti ﬀ substrates did not show any baseline increase in ROS . However , in endothelial cells on 29 kPa substrates that were treated with PMA , ROS increased by more than 50 % ( p < 0 01 compared to fold change in cells on 6 kPa gels , Figure 2 ) . Substrate sti ﬀ ness e ﬀ ects on the PMA - induced fold change in ROS were also signi ﬁ cant by one - way ANOVA ( p < 0 01 ) . These results demonstrate that sti ﬀ er substrates increase endothelial ROS in response to PMA . 3 . 3 . Endothelial Cell PKC Increased in Response to PMA Independent of PA Gel Sti ﬀ ness . PMA induces ROS produc - tion through PKC signaling [ 38 , 39 ] . We therefore measured PKC activity in PMA - treated endothelial cells on 6 , 14 , and 29 kPa PA gels to determine if PKC activation increased on sti ﬀ er substrates . PKC activity in PAEC increased 3 - 4 - fold within 5 minutes of PMA treatment ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . However , PKC activity in cells stimulated with PMA did not change signi ﬁ cantly whether the cells were on soft or sti ﬀ PA gels ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) . Therefore , the PMA - induced di ﬀ erences in oxidative stress on sti ﬀ er substrates were not related to PKC activation . 3 . 4 . Endothelial Cells Formed More Actin Stress Fibers in Response to PMA on Sti ﬀ er Gels . ROS lead to endothelial actin ﬁ ber formation [ 40 ] . PMA - stimulated cells on increas - ing sti ﬀ ness substrates were labeled for actin ﬁ bers to determine if substrate sti ﬀ ness - dependent oxidative stress increased actin ﬁ ber formation . In untreated samples , actin ﬁ bers were primarily located around the cell periphery on all substrates , although the e ﬀ ect was more pronounced in cells on the softest 6 kPa gels ( Figure 4 ( a ) , representative cell magni ﬁ cation in Figure 4 ( b ) ) . Following 15 minutes of PMA treatment , actin ﬁ bers appeared in cells on the 14 and 29kPa gels , but not in cells on the 6 kPa gels . This e ﬀ ect was even more pronounced following 30 minutes of PMA treatment , with larger stress ﬁ bers and nearly complete peripheral actin loss in endothelial cells on 14 and 29 kPa gels . Cells on 6 kPa gels largely retained peripheral actin with PMA treatment . PAECs were then labeled for pMLC to determine whether ROS - induced actin stress ﬁ ber formation was associated with increased actinomyosin contractility through pMLC localization to actin stress ﬁ bers . 1 μ M PMA treat - ment for 15 or 30 minutes did not induce pMLC transloca - tion to actin ﬁ bers or increase overall pMLC ( Figure 5 ) .

Cell nuclei were labeled with Hoechst , and ROS with CM - H 2 DCFDA . Samples were imaged at 20x by confocal microscopy . Scale bar is 25 μ m . Oxidative stress was quanti ﬁ ed using the number of positive pixels ( above the threshold ) using the custom MATLAB code . PMA - treated samples were normalized to untreated samples on the same substrate sti ﬀ ness .

These results indicate that PMA - induced actin ﬁ ber formation in cells on sti ﬀ er substrate did not correspond to actinomyosin contractility . 3 . 5 . Adherens Junctions Became Less Reticular in Response to PMA on Sti ﬀ er Gels . ROS induce cell - cell junction loss , which has been attributed in part to adherens junction protein phos - phorylation and internalization [ 41 – 43 ] .

After 15 or 30 minutes of PMA treatment , reticular junctions were mostly maintained in cells on the 6 kPa gels . In contrast , cells on the sti ﬀ est 29 kPa sub - strates lost most junction reticular structures and instead had linear or disrupted cell - cell junctions . These results demon - strate that endothelial reticular junction structure loss is exacerbated by sti ﬀ er substrates in response to the ROS - stimulant PMA . To con ﬁ rm that ROS were responsible for the PMA - induced changes in adherens junctions and actin ﬁ ber formation , the ROS scavengers N - acetyl cysteine and sodium pyruvate were administered for 1 hour prior to PMA treat - ment . These experiments were performed on glass coverslips , since junction loss following PMA exposure was highest on these sti ﬀ est substrates . ROS scavengers themselves did not a ﬀ ect cell - cell junction structure , and cells treated with PMA alone showed linear and invaginated adherens junctions ( Figure 7 ( a ) , representative cell magni ﬁ cation in Figure 7 ( c ) ) . In PAEC pretreated with ROS scavengers prior to PMA , the junction morphology change was abrogated . More strikingly , ROS scavengers prevented PMA - induced actin reorgani - zation ( Figure 7 ( b ) , representative cell magni ﬁ cation in Figure 7 ( d ) ) . Cells treated with the ROS scavengers prior to PMA showed peripheral actin bands which were similar to those in untreated cells . Thus , oxidative stress was likely responsible for PMA - induced reticular junction loss and actin ﬁ ber formation . 4 . Discussion Oxidative stress and more speci ﬁ cally the enzyme responsi - ble for superoxide production , NADPH oxidase , have been implicated in cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis in particular [ 44 , 45 ] . We now show that sti ﬀ er substrates exac - erbate endothelial cell oxidative stress . In response to PMA , endothelial cells on the sti ﬀ est substrates showed more ROS and actin stress ﬁ bers and showed greater adherens junction loss , which was not attributed to cell contractility .

Scale bar is 25 μ m . 8 Applied Bionics and Biomechanics cell - cell membranes and increased peripheral actin ﬁ ber formation in response to PMA . Since PMA - induced PKC activation was not a ﬀ ected by substrate sti ﬀ ness , it is likely that substrate sti ﬀ ness a ﬀ ected cells through alternative pathways . These data suggest that oxidative stress and its det - rimental downstream e ﬀ ects on endothelial cells and vascular disease may be enhanced in sti ﬀ er arteries . The vascular mechanics of the elastin haploinsu ﬃ cient mouse have been extensively studied , both in terms of passive mechanical stretch in response to increasing pressure and in terms of vasodilation and constriction in response to biochemical stimuli [ 13 , 37 , 46 , 47 ] . These studies focused primarily on the decrease in total elastin in the vascular wall , as well as the increase in elastin lamellae . We and others did not ﬁ nd any changes in other extracellular matrix proteins , in particular collagen , which is the other primary protein thought to de ﬁ ne vascular wall sti ﬀ ness . However , some recent studies in other tissues in elastin haploinsu ﬃ cient mice suggest that there are also collagen changes in these animals . The lungs of Eln + / - mice contained nearly twice as much col - lagen 1 and lysyl oxidase , an important collagen crosslinker , as WT mice [ 48 ] . Achilles tendons of Eln + / - mice had the same total collagen content as WT mice but di ﬀ erent collagen ﬁ bril diameter distribution [ 49 ] . Thus , it is possible that the increased sti ﬀ ness we measured in the Eln + / - aorta relates to changes in collagen content and / or structure . The thoracic aorta was consistently sti ﬀ er than the abdominal aorta in both WT and Eln + / - mice . These data agree with human studies in which aortic sti ﬀ ness decreased with distance from the heart , especially in older patients [ 50 , 51 ] . Other studies in C57BL / 6 mice demonstrated that the aortic elastic modulus was highest in the distal thoracic aorta and lowest in the abdominal aorta [ 52 ] . In a subsequent study , it was shown that the decrease in aortic sti ﬀ ness along the length of the aorta was accounted for by a decrease in total and lamellar elastin [ 53 ] . Since our data show a propor - tionally similar decrease in aortic sti ﬀ ness from the thoracic to the abdominal sections in both WT and Eln + / - mice , it is likely that elastin content is important to the regional sti ﬀ ness variation . Our data support other recently published studies show - ing that substrate sti ﬀ ness a ﬀ ects not only single endothelial cells but also con ﬂ uent endothelial monolayers [ 12 ] . In vitro studies of cell response to substrate sti ﬀ ness began when Pelham and Wang ﬁ rst used protein - coated PA gels to show that both rat kidney epithelial and 3T3 ﬁ broblasts spread to a greater extent on sti ﬀ than soft substrates [ 54 ] . Since that seminal paper , many cell types were shown to change their morphology [ 55 – 58 ] , motility [ 59 , 60 ] , di ﬀ erentiation [ 61 , 62 ] , and proliferation [ 63 , 64 ] in response to substrate sti ﬀ ness . For endothelial cells speci ﬁ cally , single cells increase the spread area [ 65 , 66 ] , sti ﬀ ness [ 67 ] , cell - matrix and cell - cell forces [ 66 , 68 ] , and proliferation [ 69 ] with substrate sti ﬀ - ness . However , as cells proliferated and reached con ﬂ uency , substrate - dependent di ﬀ erences were diminished or no longer observed [ 70 , 71 ] . Similarly , we did not observe any changes in endothelial cell and actin stress ﬁ ber mor - phology , focal adhesion size , or focal adhesion number in endothelial cell monolayers on substrates of di ﬀ erent sti ﬀ ness . However , while these morphological responses to substrate sti ﬀ ness are no longer observed as endothelial cells reach con ﬂ uency , this study shows that both endothe - lial biochemical responses and cell - cell interactions do change with substrate sti ﬀ ness . ROS , speci ﬁ cally superoxide and its byproduct hydrogen peroxide , have been shown to regulate actin ﬁ bers in vascular cells [ 40 , 72 – 74 ] . Actin ﬁ ber formation in subcon ﬂ uent reoxygenated hypoxic aortic endothelial cells was inhibited by superoxide dismutase overexpression , suggesting a key role for superoxide [ 75 ] . Superoxide can reversibly oxidize proteins , including actin itself . In endothelial cells , actin oxidation may be essential for actin polymerization during cell migration . For example , in migrating mouse aortic endo - thelial cells , actin monomer incorporation into actin ﬁ bers was diminished following treatment with the NADPH oxi - dase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium ( DPI ) and a superoxide dismutase mimetic [ 76 ] . Alternatively , superoxide can oxi - dize RhoA , enhancing GDP dissociation and subsequent activation . Fibroblasts with an oxidation - resistant form of RhoA did not form stress ﬁ bers in response to hydrogen peroxide [ 77 ] . While the source of increased ROS in endo - thelial cells on sti ﬀ er substrates remains unknown , we hypothesize that sti ﬀ substrates increase NADPH oxidase production or assembly , since NADPH oxidase appears to produce the most nonmitochondrial superoxide in endothelial cells [ 78 ] . We hope to investigate this mechanism further in future studies . Although endothelial oxidative stress has not been studied on varied sti ﬀ ness substrates , endothelial superoxide production is mechanosensitive , speci ﬁ cally in response to shear stress [ 79 ] . Bovine aortic endothelial cells produced three times more superoxide under oscillatory shear stress compared to laminar ﬂ ow [ 80 ] . Shear stress activates Rac , which is downstream of integrin activation and contributes to ROS production [ 81 , 82 ] . Epithelial cells have been shown to produce more ROS when on sti ﬀ er substrates . MMP - 3 - stimulated ROS production was approximately 3 . 5 - fold higher in epithelial cells on 4 . 02 kPa substrates compared to 0 . 13 kPasubstrates ; β 1integrinsubunitknockdowneliminated ROSproductioninresponsetoMMP - 3 [ 83 ] . These ﬁ ndings sug - gest that integrin activation - induced Rac1 activity contrib - utes to ROS production in cells on sti ﬀ er substrates [ 84 ] . The increase in adherens junction disruption could be either contractility - dependent or contractility - independent . Permeability agents , including thrombin , lipopolysaccha - ride ( LPS ) , TNF - α , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , activate the Rho / ROCK pathway and cell con - tractility [ 85 ] . The ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 prevented adherens junction disruption in endothelial monolayer studies , although some e ﬀ ects may be endothelial subtype - dependent ( e . g . , macrovascular or microvascular ) [ 86 , 87 ] . In epithelial cell protrusions , H 2 O 2 increased actin polymerization , co ﬁ lin activity , and barbed ends ; however , myosin IIA did not colocalize with actin ﬁ bers in H 2 O 2 - treated cell protrusions [ 88 ] . These data ﬁ t with our results that actin contractility did not increase with oxidative stress . Therefore , it is more likely in our case that oxidative stress induced contractility - independent adherens junction 9 Applied Bionics and Biomechanics disruption . ROS also disrupt cell - cell junctions through VE - cadherin phosphorylation . Endothelial cell treatment with permeability agonists , such as VEGF and histamine , resulted in VE - cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation [ 89 , 90 ] . In HUVECs , the ROS scavenger N - acetyl cysteine prevented VE - cadherin phosphorylation by TNF - α [ 91 ] . Thus , we hypothesize that adherens junction protein phosphorylation resulted in cell - cell junction loss , although we did not directly measure it . ROS can also lead to adverse e ﬀ ects on the endothelium beyond adherens junction loss . For example , superoxide ( O 2 - ) interacts with nitric oxide ( NO ) to form peroxynitrite . This interaction e ﬀ ectively decreases the NO availability , which is needed for vasodilation [ 92 , 93 ] . Superoxide also uncouples eNOS by oxidizing the eNOS cofactor tetrahydro - biopterin ( BH 4 ) [ 94 – 96 ] . Uncoupled eNOS produces more superoxide instead of NO [ 97 ] , which further increases peroxynitrite . Protein nitration by peroxynitrite is widely observed in many cardiovascular diseases [ 98 ] . Thus , vascu - lar sti ﬀ ness - induced endothelial oxidative stress could have damaging e ﬀ ects beyond endothelial barrier function . Substrate sti ﬀ ness also a ﬀ ects other cell types beyond endothelial cells , including ﬁ broblasts , breast cancer cells , and stem cells [ 99 , 100 ] . In vivo , tumors are sti ﬀ er than their surrounding environment , which may alter both basal func - tion and in ﬂ ammatory response in all of these cell types . In addition , some tumors overexpress speci ﬁ c NADPH oxidases [ 101 ] . This overexpression could couple with increased tumor sti ﬀ ness to further magnify oxidative stress in tumors . Tumor oxidative stress contributes to tissue injury and DNA damage in premalignant conditions , as well as in cancer initiation and progression . Since the tumor cells themselves may be resistant to oxidative stress , the injury to the surrounding tissue may be more severe [ 102 ] . Thus , sti ﬀ ness - associated ROS inhibition could potentially decrease cancer - induced damage and inhibit cancer metastasis through compromised blood vessels . While our work shows that PMA - induced oxidative stress increases with substrate sti ﬀ ness , our research is not without limitations . Phorbol esters , including PMA , are found in certain plants and can cause toxicity in animals when consumed [ 38 ] . Yet , PMA itself is not involved in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis . We chose to use PMA to isolate ROS production from cell contractility in cell - cell junction loss [ 25 , 26 ] ; however , these studies should be repeated using a physiologically relevant ROS inducer ( e . g . , tumor necrosis factor - α ) . PA gels do not fully capture the endothelial mechanical environment , including substrate viscoelasticity and relaxation as well as shear stress or strain . Several recent papers have shown interactions between shear stress and substrate sti ﬀ ness , demonstrating that softer sub - strates augmented the atheroprotective e ﬀ ects of laminar shear stress [ 103 , 104 ] . We also were not able to speci ﬁ cally detect superoxide in intact vessels under physiological conditions due to technical challenges . In future studies , a superoxide - speci ﬁ c indicator such as dihydroethidium could be used along with NADPH oxidase component knock - down to support the hypothesis that sti ﬀ ness - induced integ - rin activation enhances superoxide production by NADPH oxidase [ 105 ] . 5 . Conclusions This work illustrates a novel potential mechanism for substrate - enhanced oxidative stress in response to PKC activation in the endothelium . Since many endothelial cell studies are performed on tissue culture polystyrene of essentially in ﬁ nite sti ﬀ ness , these studies may overestimate endothelial cell response to stressors . Further study of the interaction between arterial sti ﬀ ness and oxidative stress could improve therapies to prevent or ameliorate endothelial barrier dysfunction .
