D . in Materials Science and Nanotechnology Advisor : Aykutlu Dˆana July 2017 In this thesis , changes in Young ' s modulus of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) were investigated during their osteogenic diﬀerentiation on bioactive peptide nanoﬁbers that bear triple glutamic acid sequence ( EEE ) , a non - collagenous protein sequence of some extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins ( e . g . bone sialo - protein ) found in bone tissue . MSCs formed spherical cell aggregates on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers , here also called osteospheroids , of which their cells made intensive cell - cell contacts and showed osteoblast - like cell morphology . Mechanical characterization of the osteospheroids on the peptide nanoﬁber hy - drogel was performed using atomic force microscope ( AFM ) where AFM probes modiﬁed with a thin ﬁlm coating of octaﬂuorocyclobutane ( C 4 F 8 ) were used to measure force maps of the cells at days 3 , 7 and 14 of osteogenic diﬀerentiation . Hertz Cone model , same as Sneddon , was applied to approach curves of 12 force curves per cell to calculate the Young ' s modulus values . As a result , an increasing pattern was observed in the average Young ' s modulus of rMSCs on the peptide nanoﬁbers throughout the osteogenic diﬀerentiation . Mineral deposition by the cells on the peptide nanoﬁbers was checked by Alizarin red staining and a large amount of mineral deposition by the osteospheroids was observed , proving that an eﬃcient osteogenic diﬀerentiation of the rMSCs happens on the osteoinduc - tive peptide nanoﬁbers . In the literature , a gradual decrease is shown in AFM measured average Young ' s modulus values of adhered MSCs throughout their os - teogenic diﬀerentiation . When gelatin - coated glass was used as substrate instead of the peptide nanoﬁbers , rMSCs showed a decreasing pattern in their Young ' s moduli , similarly to the literature , due to osteogenic diﬀerentiation . However , there was no signiﬁcant calcium mineral deposition on the gelatin group , even until day 14 of osteogenic diﬀerentiation , indicating that a limited or a slower progression of osteogenic diﬀerentiation of rMSCs is present on the gelatin com - pared to rMSCs on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers . A correlation between the observed increase in average Young ' s moduli of osteospheroid rMSCs and iii iv their mineral production on the peptide nanoﬁbers may suggest a predominant role of biomineralization on the cell mechanics . Keywords : Atomic force microscopy , mesenchymal stem cells , osteogenic diﬀer - entiation , peptide amphiphiles , self - assembly , nanoﬁbers . ¨OZET OSTEO˙IND ¨UKT˙IF PEPT˙IT NANOF˙IBERLER ¨UZER˙INDE MEZENK˙IMAL K ¨OK H ¨UCRE MEKAN˙I ˘G˙I Ahmet Emin Topal Malzeme Bilimi ve Nanoteknoloji , Doktora Tez Danı¸smanı : Aykutlu Dˆana Temmuz 2017 Mezenkimal k¨ok h¨ucrelerin ( MSC’lerin ) osteojenik farklıla¸sması sırasında Young katsayısı de˘gi¸simleri , bone sialoprotein gibi kemik dokusunda bulunan ve kolla - jen olmayan bazı h¨ucreler arası matris ( ECM ) proteinlerinin yapısında bulunan ¨u¸cl¨u glutamik asit ( EEE ) dizisi ta¸sıyan biyoaktif peptit nanoﬁberler ¨uzerinde ara¸stırılmı¸stır . Osteoind¨uktif peptit nanoﬁberler ¨uzerindeki MSC ' ler burada os - teok¨uremsi olarak da bahsedilen , birbirleriyle yo˘gun etkile¸sim i¸cerisinde bulu - nan ve osteoblast gibi h¨ucre morfolojisine sahip olan h¨ucre k¨umeleri olu¸sturur . Atomik kuvvet mikroskobu ( AFM ) ve oktaﬂorosiklob¨utan ( C 4 F 8 ) ince ﬁlmi ka - planmı¸s AFM ¨ol¸c¨um u¸cları kullanılarak peptit nanoﬁber hidrojel ¨uzerinde os - teojenik y¨onde farklıla¸smakta olan sı¸can MSC ' lerin ( rMSC ' lerin ) kuvvet har - italaması ¨ol¸c¨umleri yapılmı¸stır . H¨ucre ba¸sına 12 adet kuvvet - uzaklık e˘grisi ¨ol¸c¨um¨un¨un yakla¸sma e˘grileri , Hertz Cone ( Sneddon ile aynı ) modeline g¨ore ﬁt edilerek h¨ucrelerin Young katsayısı de˘gerleri hesaplanmı¸stır . Peptit nanoﬁber - ler ¨uzerindeki osteok¨uremsi h¨ucrelerin ortalama Young katsayısının osteojenik farklıla¸sma sırasında arttı˘gı g¨ozlemlenmi¸stir . ˙Ikinci olarak , peptit nanoﬁberler ¨uzerindeki h¨ucreler tarafından ¸cok miktarda mineral biriktirildi˘gi Alizarin red boyaması sonucunda g¨ozlemlenmi¸stir ve bu sonu¸c rMSC ' lerin peptit nanoﬁber - ler ¨uzerinde etkili bir osteojenik farkıla¸sma ya¸sadı˘gını kanıtlamaktadır . Lit - erat¨urde , osteojenik farklıla¸san MSC ' lerin AFM ile ¨ol¸c¨ulm¨u¸s Young katsayısı ¸calı¸smalarında , h¨ucrelerin ortalama Young katsayısında yava¸s yava¸s bir d¨u¸s¨u¸s trendi g¨ozlenmektedir . Peptit nanoﬁberler yerine jelatin kaplı cam y¨uzey kul - lanıldı˘gında Young katsayısında d¨u¸s¨u¸s g¨ozlenmektedir ; ve bu d¨u¸s¨u¸s osteojenik farklıla¸smadan dolayıdır . Ancak , kalsiyum minerallerinin jelatin ¨uzerindeki h¨ucrelerde yeterli miktarda birikmemesi jelatin ¨uzerindeki h¨ucrelerde sınırlı veya daha yava¸s bir osteojenik farklıla¸smanın ger¸cekle¸sti˘gini g¨osteriyor olabilir . Os - teoind¨uktif peptit nanoﬁberler ¨uzerinde osteojenik farklıla¸san h¨ucrelerin geni¸s kapsamlı kalsiyum minerali ¨uretti˘ginin g¨ozlenmesi ile h¨ucrelerin ortalama Young v vi katsayısındaki artı¸sı arasındaki korelasyon biyomineralizayonun h¨ucre mekani˘gi ¨uzerinde baskın bir rol¨u oldu˘gunu destekleyebilir . Anahtar s¨ozc¨ukler : Atomik kuvvet mikroskopisi , mezenkimal k¨ok h¨ucreler , osteo - jenik farklıla¸sma , peptit amﬁﬁller , kendili˘ginden bir araya gelme , Young katsayısı , nanoﬁberler .

Understanding identity and properties of MSCs and the cells diﬀerentiated from MSCs is important to better exploit their therapeutic potential for treating such conditions . Stem cells ' physical properties have been studied in detail in the recent decades and their mechanical properties seem to have been well - characterized in vitro . However , majority of studies characterizing their mechanical properties do not use extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) or ECM mimicking moieties in their microenvironment ; rather , they usually measure cells adhered on a ﬂat glass substrate or a Petri dish . It is remarkable to note that a stem cell ' s niche might be very inﬂuential on its character and identity not only biochemically but also physically . Therefore , it is crucial to accurately characterize the mechanical properties of stem cells when they are in an in vivo - like state . Here , I focus on the characterization of Young ' s moduli of MSCs in an environment that mimics the ECM by utilizing bioactive peptide sequences within a nanoﬁbrous mesh network so that when I measure mechanical properties of the cells on the bioactive peptide nanoﬁbers , measurement results might better represent in vivo conditions . I used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to measure force maps of MSCs to characterize their 1 Young ' s moduli when diﬀerentiating into the osteogenic lineage on a bioactive peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel . AFM probes modiﬁed with a Teﬂon - like thin ﬁlm coating were used to obtain easier and smoother force curve measurements on the cells and to reduce the adhesion between the cells and the probe . 1 . 1 Osteoinduction 1 . 1 . 1 Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) A stem cell describes any cell that can both self - renew and give rise to cells found in tissues . MSC is a nonhematopoietic adult stem cell type and has multipotency ( i . e . the potential to give rise into more than one cell type but is more limited than pluripotency ) to fully diﬀerentiate into lineages of mesenchymal tissues , that are bone , cartilage , fat , muscle , stroma , marrow , connective and tendon / ligament tissues , and controversially the neuronal cells [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] . Founder of MSC biology was Alexander Friedenstein who ﬁrstly isolated ﬁbroblastic cells from bone marrow that could diﬀerentiate into osteoblasts , osteocytes , chondrocytes , adipocytes and into myoblasts [ 1 , 6 ] . Friedenstein called them “osteogenic stem cells” and Arnold Caplan ﬁrst used the term “mesenchymal stem cell” [ 9 ] . MSCs are also known to have immunosuppressive abilities [ 10 ] . Osteoinduction is the phenomenon of encouraging undiﬀerentiated cells like MSCs to become active osteoblasts and it is also a generally used term for os - teogenesis induced by bone grafting materials [ 11 ] . Autologous bone grafting is the surgical operation for replacement of a missing bone from another place of the patient ' s body and it is the current standard of care when natural bone repair mechanisms fail [ 12 ] . In addition to bone grafting , development of novel osteogenic tissue engineering methods might be necessary for treatment of dis - eases such as osteoarthritis ( OA ) of which there has been no therapy that can neither stop or reverse the disease progression yet [ 13 ] . All of the joints con - tain MSCs and their healthy development depends on MSC activity , and hence 2 OA might be associated with changes in MSC quantity , phenotype , morphology and / or function [ 1 ] . In osteoporosis ( OP ) , eﬀect of MSCs was pointed out to be more prominent as the MSC number and responsiveness to bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) were reported to inﬂuence the disease progress [ 14 ] . BMP is a protein found in the ECM of bone tissue and it enables morphogenesis of cells diﬀerentiating towards the osteogenic lineage . Infusion of wild type MSCs to osteoporosis imperfecta ( OI ) mouse models ends up with improvement of bone mineralization and collagen synthesis [ 9 ] . As such , MSC - based cell therapies are holding their promise for promoting bone and cartilage repair , and there is a continuing need for readily - available source of MSCs and biomaterials like mi - crocarriers and hydrogels to inject the cells with to the patients and to enhance the repair of damaged tissues . Bioreactors with stirred microcarriers have been shown to provide higher potency for osteogenic diﬀerentiation when MSCs are cultured in three - dimensional scaﬀold cultures [ 15 ] . There may be great heterogeneity within MSC populations , hence obtaining a homogenous MSC population is a diﬃcult task . Careful identiﬁcation and char - acterization of the cells are needed . Cell surface markers that MSCs express are CD105 , CD73 , CD90 , CD146 , CD13 , CD29 , CD44 , CD166 and CD10 , Nestin , Stro - 1 , SSEA - 4 , CD271 and Sca - 1 , but they lack expressions of CD45 , CD34 , CD14 or CD11b , CD79a or CD19 , and HLA - DR [ 16 , 17 ] . Heterogeneous ex - pression of such markers by cells from clones might be observed , which might be a cause of heterogeneity in diﬀerentiation potential observed within MSC popu - lations [ 9 ] . MSCs have been isolated from bone marrow , adipose ( fat ) , dermis ( skin ) , synovial ﬂuid , periosteum , umbilical cord blood , placenta and amniotic ﬂuid [ 18 ] . So , another important cause of heterogeneity is the site of deriva - tion because it inﬂuences the commitment of MSCs and the lineages by biasing diﬀerentiation trajectories , and thus functions of the diﬀerentiated cells [ 19 ] . MSCs are highly responsive to environmental cues and they have ability to modulate their microenvironment through regulating their secretions of humoral and structural proteins as well as their ECM proteins [ 20 ] . It has been suggested that MSC niche in the bone marrow has distinct locations named endosteal niche , stromal niche and perivascular niche [ 16 ] . Native ECM of bone marrow as a key 3 component of the MSC niche has been reported to be very important in preserving the stemness and diﬀerentiation potential of bone - marrow derived - MSCs ( BM - MSCs ) [ 21 ] . CD271 , MSCA - 1 / Stro - 3 / non - speciﬁc alkaline phosphatase , Stro - 1 , CD146 , CD49a , CD106 , CD51 , CD200 , CD90 , PDGFR α ( CD140a ) , PDGFR β ( CD140b ) and Leptin R ( CD295 ) were listed as markers of native BM - MSCs in a recent report [ 14 ] . BM - MSCs are isolated via bone marrow aspiration and separated from other cells by density centrifugation followed by seeding to tissue culture polystyrene for their proliferation [ 22 ] . Population doubling of BM - MSCs is several times a week ; culture medium should be replenished within every 3 - 4 days , and the cells should be passaged upon near - conﬂuence ( i . e . 70 - 80 % of conﬂuency ) . Usually , trypsin passaging is preferred in which the cells are treated with the enzyme trypsin , a serine protease , to remove adhesive peptide bonds between the cells and the tissue culture polystyrene , incubated for 3 - 5 minutes at cell culture incubator and the cells are then transferred to a new tube in the suspended state and seeded to a new tissue culture polysterene ﬂask . After prolonged in vitro culture , in other words , at senescent passages ( i . e . P8 or later ) , MSCs start losing their multipotency and some of the cells start diﬀerentiating with a tendency towards the osteogenic lineage [ 16 ] . To induce diﬀerentiation , maintenance medium that contains Dulbecco ' s mod - iﬁed Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % pen - cillin / streptomycin ) is replaced with a diﬀerentiation induction medium . An osteogenic diﬀerentiation medium is usually maintenance medium supplemented with ascorbic acid , dexamethasone and β - glycerophosphate because those factors are known to induce / promote osteogenic diﬀerentiation of MSCs [ 23 ] . As the MSCs start diﬀerentiating , their proliferation is repressed ( but not stops , it is de - creased to a minimal rate ) . There occurs changes in gene expression and protein production levels that are related to the lineage of diﬀerentiation . Multipotency , cell function and morphology are also subject to remarkable changes . 4 1 . 1 . 2 Osteogenic diﬀerentiation of MSCs Bone cells include bone - forming osteoblasts that make up the osteoid matrix and aid the bone mineralization , osteocytes that are found in the bone matrix and have dendritic lamellipodia , and bone - degrading osteoclasts that take role in the bone resorption ( Figure 1 . 1 ) [ 24 ] . Through transitory steps , intermediary cells are formed during osteogenic diﬀerentiation where MSCs diﬀerentiate ﬁrst into osteoprogenitor cells and later into pre - osteoblasts . Next immature osteoblasts are formed , and then there is a maturation period of osteoblasts followed by a mineralization stage . Mature osteoblasts either operate as bone lining cells or further diﬀerentiate into osteocytes . If not either , they enter apoptosis and die . Osteoblast diﬀerentiation has been argued to be positively regulated with increased direct cell - cell contact [ 25 ] . On the contrary , osteocyte diﬀerentiaton has been suggested to be positively regulated with intercellular separation [ 26 ] . Chemistry , topography and stiﬀness of substrate / matrix used for cultivating MSCs matter for lineage speciﬁcation . Interestingly , very stiﬀ substrates like graphene were shown to accelerate the osteogenic diﬀerentiation of MSCs [ 28 ] . Discher group argues that for 2D gels , 20 - 100 kPa interval is the eﬃciency range and 30 kPa is the optimum value of matrix stiﬀness to promote osteogenic dif - ferentiation with calciﬁcation , because the stiﬀness of the osteoid matrix is 30 - 40 kPa [ 29 ] . Mooney group’s claim for the optimum value of hydrogel elastic mod - ulus for bone formation at osteogenic diﬀerentiation of MSCs is 60 kPa , however , they did not test 20 kPa in some of their analyses ( instead they used 5 kPa ) in their study , thus leaving their investigation not fully answered because they did not rule out 20 - 60 kPa interval in all of their experiments [ 30 ] . There are osteogenic markers found within the cells from MSCs to osteoblasts whose expression levels vary in each of the diﬀerent cell type . Runt - related tran - scription factor 2 ( Runx2 ) , one of these osteogenic markers , is a transcription factor that binds to promoter sequences of osteogenic genes in the cell nucleus and is expressed at high levels in osteoprogenitor cells and pre - osteoblasts during the early periods of osteogenic diﬀerentiation , which are the commitment and 5 Figure 1 . 1 : Bone remodeling cycle with osteogenic lineages from mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) and hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) . Osteoblast progenitor ( or osteoprogenitor cell ) and pre - osteoblast cells are transitions between MSC to osteoblast . Illustration reprinted with permission from Rahman et al . [ 27 ] . proliferation stages [ 24 ] . Runx2 is the master regulator of transcription and is essential for the osteogenic diﬀerentiation process to proceed to the osteoblasts [ 31 ] . Osterix ( Osx ) is another obligatory osteoblast - speciﬁc transcription factor which takes a transcriptional regulatory role in the proliferation stage of which it favors osteoblast diﬀerentiation and may inhibit the proliferation of cells [ 32 , 33 ] . Transforming growth factor - beta ( TGF - β ) / bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) signaling plays an important role in osteoblast diﬀerentiation through the activa - tion of receptor serine / threonine kinases [ 27 ] . BMP is a cytokine and a ligand of BMP receptor ( BMPR ) which is a serine / threonine kinase receptor and be - longs to the TGF - β superfamily group of proteins [ 27 ] . There are more than 20 recognized BMPs and some of them like BMP2 , BMP4 and BMP7 are potent osteoinductive factors and inducers of osteogenesis [ 27 ] . Wnt signaling pathway also promotes the commitment of MSCs to osteoblast diﬀerentiation and inhibit 6 chondrogenic diﬀerentiation at the same time [ 34 ] . At the matrix maturation step , a mid - stage of osteogenic diﬀerentiation be - tween pre - osteoblasts and early osteoblasts , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) enzyme activity , and collagen I and bone sialoprotein ( BSP ) protein expressions increase while Runx2 expression decreases [ 24 ] . High level expression of ALP enzyme prevents eﬀects of biomineralization inhibitors like pyrophosphates by degrading pyrophosphate groups and releasing phosphate ions [ 35 ] . BSP promotes biomin - eralization through functioning in mineral nucleation [ 35 ] . Detailed information about BSP protein structure and function is present at the next subsection ( 1 . 1 . 3 ) . Osteocalcin ( OC ) and osteopontin ( OPN ) are late stage markers of osteoblast dif - ferentiation and they both bind calcium , and their expression levels are increased during the mineralization stage [ 36 , 37 ] . Because BSP and OPN bind to integrin proteins , they are also classiﬁed as small integrin - binding ligand , N - linked glyco - proteins ( SIBLINGs ) [ 35 ] . Tenascin - C ( TN - C ) , another matricellular protein like BSP and OPN , causes cell rounding during morphogenesis , thus osteoblasts fail to spread because of tenascin - C expression according to some studies [ 38 , 39 ] . However , there is some controversy on the role of tenascin - C as some studies that claim a TN - C - mediated cell spreading are also present [ 40 ] . Parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) is a peptide hormone that has regulatory roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis , and in bone formation and resorption by being a ligand of PTH / PTH - related peptide ( PTHrP ) type I receptor [ 41 ] , a G - protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) that is expressed in pre - osteoblasts , os - teoblasts , MSCs and bone lining cells in bone , and downregulates sclerostin ex - pressed by osteocytes to rescue the inhibition of the canonical Wnt / β - catenin signaling , therefore favoring the osteoanabolic actions to proceed [ 42 ] . 1 . 1 . 3 Biomineralization Biomineralization is a dynamic and lifegoing process in which living organisms produce and deposit minerals . In healthy people , biomineralization occurs in bone , cartilage and teeth . Bone is a natural composite material and 90 % of its 7 organic components are type I collagen and the remaining part contains noncol - lagenous proteins [ 43 ] . Inorganic components of bone are mainly composed of hydroxyapatite , Ca 10 ( PO 4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 [ 43 ] . Deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals occurs in an organized manner to provide a hierarchical organization to the bone ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . Mineral deposition is regulated by bone cells and the ECM they produce , where promoters of mineralization activate mineral nucleation and in - hibitors of mineralization protect the ECM by preventing the nucleation at the times when mineralization is not desired [ 44 ] . Figure 1 . 2 : Bone structure and organizations of compact ( cortical ) bone at macro - , micro - and nanoscales . Compact bone is diagrammatically shown with os - teon structures at the microscale that contain collagen ﬁbrils and hydroxyapatite nanocrystals at the nanoscale . Illustration reprinted with permission from a re - view by Wegst et al . [ 45 ] . Osteoblasts function in the initiation of mineral deposition [ 46 ] . Osteoblasts ﬁrst secrete a non - mineralized osteoid matrix that contains type I collagen ﬁbrils and noncollagenous ECM proteins [ 47 , 48 ] . There occurs a progressive stiﬀen - ing of the collagen ﬁbrils due to nucleation of minerals during the maturation stage of osteoblast diﬀerentiation . This stiﬀening is known to be physiologically important but its mechanism still remains to be elaborated [ 49 ] . Osteoblasts secrete the calcium and phosphate ions into bone ECM [ 50 , 51 ] . Osteoblasts and osteocytes are known to interact with each other which might also be an aiding / contributing factor to the biomineralization ( Figure 1 . 3 ) . Participation of osteocytes to the mineralization process and , speciﬁcally , what roles they actu - ally take on remain to be investigated further [ 35 ] , even though there have been investigations on the subject and osteocytes were argued to play a regulatory role 8 in mineral homeostasis and osteoblast behavior [ 52 ] . Secretion of some non - collagenous ECM proteins regulates hydroxyapatite nu - cleation on the collagen ﬁbrils . BSP , a SIBLING protein found mostly in the bone ECM , has important roles in skeletal mineralization and has a binding segment to collagen ( Figure 1 . 4 ) . Functions of BSP include initiation of hydroxyapatite crystal formation , attracting phosphates and concentrating calcium ions via elec - trostatic interactions [ 53 ] . Moreover , its expression was claimed to help formation of the osteoblastic cell morphology [ 54 ] . In the protein structure of BSP , there are repeats of glutamic acid ( Glu ) amino acids ( polyglutamate stretches ) at the Ca 2 + binding site ( Figure 1 . 4 ) . On the role of amino acids in biomineralization , one group reported that Glu has an inhibiting eﬀect on hydroxyapatite nucle - ation [ 55 ] . However , BSP protein having polyglutamate sequences at the Ca 2 + binding site favors mineral nucleation [ 56 , 57 ] . In a comparison study of variable - length polyglutamate addition to a collagen - mimetic peptide ( DGEA ) , binding of the peptide to β - tricalcium phosphate signiﬁcantly increased as the number of glutamate amino acids added was increased from 0 to 2 , 4 and 7 glutamates [ 58 ] . OPN , another SIBLING , is a key regulator that can inhibit the hydroxyapatite nucleation upon its phosphorylation [ 36 ] . Absence of BSP causes an upregula - tion of OPN expression [ 59 ] and OPN is the only SIBLING protein expressed in a BSP knockout ( BSP - / - ) mice , whose expression level is higher than that of wild type mice ( BSP + / + ) [ 60 ] . Absence of BSP causes impairment of terminal os - teoblast diﬀerentiation , however , does not prevent commitment of MSCs into the ostogenic lineage , recruitment of MSCs , and their initial diﬀerentiation into os - teoprogenitors [ 53 ] . Overexpressing BSP leads to an enhancenment of osteoblast diﬀerentiation via increases in expresions of osteogenic markers including Runx2 , osterix and osteocalcin [ 53 ] . Osteonectin , also known as SPARC , is a bone tissue speciﬁc protein that se - lectively binds to both hydroxyapatite and collagen , primarily found in the ECM and is responsible for linking minerals to collagen ﬁbrils [ 41 ] . Osteonectin activity leads to increased ﬁbril assembly , cross - linking and accumulation of collagen in the ECM [ 12 ] . 9 Figure 1 . 3 : Regions of biomineralization in the bone . Osteoblast - osteocyte inter - action is shown . Osteons contain osteoblasts and osteocytes communicating with each other . Role of osteocytes on biomineralization is to be investigated further .

[ 35 ] with permission from Nature Publishing Group . 10 Figure 1 . 4 : Chromosomal location and size , and protein structure of bone sialo - protein ( BSP ) . This ﬁgure is a reprint obtained with permission [ 53 ] . 11 Contribution of matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) to osteogenic diﬀerentiation has also been reported . For instance , metalloproteinase MT1 - MMP is important in formation of bone nodules and mineral nucleation [ 61 , 62 ] . Structural disorder of proteins favors growth phase of mineralization [ 63 , 64 ] . Peptide nanoﬁbers might be good candidates to provide disordered nano - and microstructures ( e . g . ﬁbers and bundles , respectively ) to the cells . Peptide nanoﬁbers are discussed in Section 1 . 4 . Most noncollagenous proteins of bone ECM including BSP and OPN are intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) , which allows them to have diﬀerent interactions because of having ﬂexibility ( e . g . ran - dom coil ) in their shape [ 44 ] and being multifunctional as they usually have diﬀerent binding sites like calcium binding site , collagen binding segment and RGD sequence ( Figure 1 . 4 ) . An example to novel approaches of biomineralization - inspired studies could be a noncovalent vaccine engineering study where viruses were engineered to secrete peptides with abilities of inducing biomineralization via calcium phosphate [ 65 ] . Although the goal of the study was immunization , novel methods like this can be tried for promoting bone regeneration . 1 . 1 . 4 Mechanical properties of mineralized tissues Calcium content is correlated to high Young ' s modulus and hardness values in mammalian mineralized tissues like long bones and dental tissues [ 66 ] . Be - cause having high elastic moduli is proportional to the mineral content , clinical conditions that involve deﬁciency in calcium - phosphorus product end up with a decrease in stiﬀness values of the tissues [ 35 ] . Young ' s modulus of dentin tissue is usually found within 10 - 30 GPa value range according to measurements with compression , nanoindenter , atomic force microscopy and 4 - point bending methods [ 67 ] . Ultrasound and microtensile measurements gives an average trabecular ( cancellous ) bone Young ' s modulus of 14 . 8 GPa ± 1 . 4 and 10 . 4 GPa ± 3 . 5 , and an average Young ' s modulus of cortical 12 bone Young ' s modulus of 20 . 7 GPa ± 1 . 9 and 18 . 6 GPa ± 3 . 5 [ 68 ] . In a recent nanoindentation based study performed with Berkovich tip , Young’s modulus values of human periosteal cortical bone , endoosteal cortical bone and trabecular bone were found to be 7 . 63 ± 1 . 31 GPa , 7 . 48 ± 3 . 09 GPa and 5 . 11 ± 2 . 82 GPa , respectively [ 69 ] . Mineralizing collagen ﬁbers take role in the regulation of physiological miner - alization of bone where the calcium rich matrix vesicles are located on according to a recent review [ 35 ] . Hence , mechanical properties of the bone are inﬂuenced remarkably by collagen matrix . There has been reports on the predominant role of ﬁbrillar collagen on the bone biomineralization based on control of the size , three - dimensional distribution , and nucleation of apatite crystals at larger scales [ 70 ] . Human MSCs - seeded into calcium phosphate mineral deposited scaﬀolds were investigated for analyzing their mechanical properties via compression system and it was found that mineralized scaﬀolds had dramatically higher and increasing elastic modulus values than non - mineralized scaﬀolds which were very low and steady according to measurements performed at days 14 , 28 and 56 of osteogenic diﬀerentiation [ 71 ] . Spherical cellular aggregates , also known as spheroids , have been mentioned as good candidates in the literature for studying tissue mechanics in vitro [ 72 , 73 ] and they are introduced and discussed in the following subsection . 1 . 1 . 5 Stem cell aggregates MSC aggregation mechanism was proposed before as assembly , reorganization and compaction of cells via involvement of integrin and cadherin proteins , and the contribution of tension forces , cortical tension and actin stress ﬁbers [ 74 ] . Similarly , E - cadherin was also pointed out to play important roles for embryonic tissue compaction and three - dimensional organization of stem cells into spheroids [ 75 , 76 ] . Some of the integrin alpha subunits ( i . e . α 1 , α 2 , α 4 , α 9 , α 10 , α 11 ) have 13 collagen binding speciﬁcity [ 77 ] , which might be helpful to suggest that some os - teogenic cells within diﬀerentiating MSC aggregates , such as mature osteoblasts , increase deposition of extracellular minerals via mechanosensing their microenvi - ronment consisting of mostly type I collagen ﬁbrils . Recently , osteogenic diﬀeren - tiating MSC spheroids in collagen gels were shown to deposit higher amounts of calcium than a monolayer of adherent MSCs on the collagen gels [ 78 ] . Spheroids are known to be promising for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine ( Fig - ure 1 . 5 ) . I am referring the cell aggregates and spheroids here because I observed similar compact aggregates of diﬀerentiating MSCs on the peptide nanoﬁbers that I utilize for promoting osteogenic diﬀerentiation , as discussed in Section 1 . 4 . Spheroid organization of mouse embryonic stem cells was argued to be regulated by physical conﬁnement signals [ 75 ] . Similarly , peptide nanoﬁbers might be causing MSCs to be in a physically conﬁned microenvironment and thus forcing the MSCs to aggregate as spheroids . I intended to measure Young ' s modulus of the cells of the aggregates which may have more realistic values , or in other words , might better represent the native cellular organization of osteoblast - like cells in vivo because they resemble bone nodules in cell morphology and mineral deposition ability . Cell aggregates were suggested in the literature to migrate in a collective man - ner where cells can be thought to be linked to each other with springs [ 79 ] . About the spreading dynamics , it was pointed out that cells of the aggregate / spheroid act like a liquid drop whereas cells escaping from the spheroid were claimed to act in a 2D gas state [ 80 ] . 14 Figure 1 . 5 : Spheroids or stem cell aggregates are promising for tissue engineering because of their regenerative potential . In this diagram both scaﬀold - based and scaﬀold - free approaches for using spheroids are presented . This ﬁgure is reprinted with permission of Laschke et al . [ 81 ] . 1 . 2 Mechanical analysis techniques for single cells 1 . 2 . 1 Micropipette aspiration The mechanical properties of cells can be studied by using a micropipette , a rigid tube , at which a cell is drawn into , which leads to the formation of a cell protrusion . Then the surface tension can be calculated based on the length of the cell protrusion and the pressure diﬀerence between inside and outside of the micropipette [ 82 ] . Typically , cells in suspension are analyzed , but substrate - adhered cells can also be studied by using the micropipette aspiration technique [ 83 ] . Sea urchin embryos were measured in 1954 with “cell elastimeter” that Mitchi - son and Swann described , of which the results provided a better understanding 15 of cytokinesis , the cytoplasmic cell divison [ 72 ] . Since then , micropipette aspira - tions were used for cell mechanics studies , especially with the suspended cells to measure their surface tension and viscosity and thereby also to determine their elastic modulus . Cytoskeletal surface tension ( cortical tension ) is tensile ( stretch - ing ) force per unit area within the cell membrane , and can be measured using this technique assuming that the cell behaves like a liquid drop . There are various liquid drop mechanical models like Newtonian model and Maxwell model which can be applied to calculate the surface tension from the micropipette aspiration measurements [ 84 ] , which I will not discuss here . Micropipette aspiration measurements of chondrogenic diﬀerentiating human MSCs showed that the diﬀerentiated cells increased their stiﬀness [ 85 ] . According to a micropipette aspiration based cell mechanics study , while human MSCs also increase their elastic modulus during osteogenic diﬀerentiation , they decrease their elastic modulus during adipogenic diﬀerentiation [ 86 ] . Plasticity of cell nucleus was also studied using the micropipette aspiration and nuclei of embryonic stem cells were found to stiﬀen 6 - folds through terminal diﬀerentiation [ 87 ] . It is also possible to analyze cellular aggregates ( or spheroids ) by using the micropipette aspiration technique at the suspended state because of collective mechanical behavior of cellular aggregates as intercellular junctions ( i . e . cad - herins ) allow the cells to have strong chemo - mechanical interactions with each other . Micropipette aspiration of cellular aggregates was ﬁrst reported in 2010 , where the study estimated a 700 Pa elastic modulus and 5 - 7 mN / m surface ten - sion of spherical cellular aggregates of sarcoma ( S180 ) cell lines expressing various levels of E - cadherin molecules at their cell surface [ 88 ] . It might be beneﬁcial to study cellular aggregate mechanics to better understand tissue mechanics be - cause spheroids are closer to tissues than monolayers of cells in that they express ECM material and that there are intercellular junctions between the cells that are in close contact with each other in three - dimensions unlike the monolayers of cells which express ECM material and connect with intercellular junctions . Furthermore , micropipette aspiration technique can be applied in vivo as well . 16 Disadvantages of micropipette aspiration technique are that the curvature drawn into the micropipette might cause damage to the cell ( s ) and that the friction between wall of glass micropipette and the cell ( s ) is usually neglected in the measurements , assuming that the glass wall is non - adhesive to the cell ( s ) [ 89 ] . Other than those , it is a simple and inexpensive technique , is possible to apply to both suspended and adherent cells , and can even be used for in vivo tissue mechanics , which make it a really interesting and advantageous technique . 1 . 2 . 2 Microrheology Rheology is the study of deformation and ﬂow of matter in response to an applied stress . It is conventionally performed with a rheometer equipment which performs parallel plate compression on several millimeters of a material . A new way of doing rheology is microrheology where a micron scale probe embedded in the material is used to deform locally . This might be more advantageous for the case of cellular measurements because traditional rheometer measures bulk samples at macroscopic scale whereas microrheology has a measurement capability at the cellular scale and single cells can be studied more easily . Microrheology is classiﬁed as active and passive . Approach of active microrheology techniques is very similar to traditional rheology because there is stress applied to the material in both , however , diﬀerently in active microrheology , a micrometer - sized bead is used and the elastic and viscous properties of the cell determine how the bead moves on or inside the cell [ 90 ] . Magnetic twisting cytometry ( MTC ) is one of the active microrheology methods and a magnetic micrometer - sized bead is rotated on top of a cell via magnetic forces exerted from twisting and magnetizing coil [ 90 ] . The bead position is tracked to determine the mechanical response , thus MTC is good for measuring the mechanical properties of adherent - cells [ 90 ] . Notably , Francis Crick tried to measure physical properties of cytoplasm using MTC technique [ 91 ] . Magnetic pulling is another active microrheology method where magnetic tweezers are used to pull the magnetic microbead [ 90 ] . Passive microrheology is diﬀerent from active microrheology and simpler in 17 terms of laboratory equipment need because there is no applied stress on the ma - terial ( i . e . picoNewton or nanoNewton forces are needed in active microrheology which requires advanced laboratory equipment ) and rather the approach is based on thermal excitation of bead particle without application of an external force [ 90 ] . Laser particle tracking microrheology is an example to passive microrhe - ology in which the viscoelastic modulus can be measured with wide bandwidth inside the cells after inferring from the Brownian motion of particles embedded in the cytoskeletal network [ 92 ] . 1 . 2 . 3 Optical trapping , optical tweezers and the optical stretcher ( OS ) Arthur Ashkin realized in 1969 that manipulation of dielectric particles might be possible by using intense laser based on its radiation pressure [ 93 ] . In 1980s , he demonstrated a single focused beam trapping in a three - dimensional optical trap for dielectric particles [ 93 , 94 ] . Optical stretching ( OS ) in the time domain introduced by Guck and K¨as surpasses optical tweezers or optical traps for use in cell mechanics studies because it is not limited in force since focusing is not required and hence OS can deform the cells unlike the optical tweezers , which are not suﬃcient in force range for deforming the cells [ 95 ] . Notably , OS can be used to measure the deformability of adherent cells and non - adherent cells in suspension high - throughputly , about 100 cells per hour [ 22 , 96 ] . 1 . 2 . 4 Traction force microscopy ( TFM ) Cell traction force microscopy , a relatively newer technique than those afore - mentioned , is used to determine tractions for quantitation of cell mechanics of adherent cells ﬁrst through the computation of displacement ﬁelds from embed - ded ﬂuorescent marker beads and then by reconstruction of the cellular traction [ 97 ] . Three - dimensional reconstruction and distribution of cellular tractions were recently studied with hydrogel substrate and matrices [ 98 , 99 ] . Traction forces 18 exerted by cells are lateral to the substrate / matrix and inward to the cell center [ 100 ] . Deformation of substrate / matrix induced by these traction forces is mea - sured in TFM [ 82 ] . Therefore , an understanding of the mechanical properties of the matrix utilized is also required for TFM measurements [ 101 ] . Another important requirement is to have an ability for tracking the motion of beads such as cross - correlation which allows precise determination of position hence the dis - placement ﬁelds of particles [ 82 ] . Resolution of TFM is 1 - 3 µ m [ 102 ] and the force range is between 2 and 120 nN [ 101 ] . TFM allows studying inherent con - tractility of adherent cells by measuring distribution and magnitude of traction stresses generated through their focal adhesions [ 103 ] . There is an issue of non - linearity of ﬁbrous structures in substrate materials like in the native ECM , that is , the stiﬀness of individual nanoﬁbers is relatively much larger than the network of ﬁbers and bundles , which might complicate the characterization of appropriate properties relevant to cells [ 101 ] . In other words , stress over strain ratio is not constant through changes unlike the linear elastic materials , but rather is dependent on the magnitude of the strain for the native ECM or ECM - mimicking ﬁbrous networks [ 101 ] . Another issue could rise from reliability of determination of displacement ﬁelds because there might be possible eﬀects of change of cell mechanical over the displacement ﬁelds and furthermore if the level of conﬂuency is high , the displacement ﬁelds might overlap [ 101 ] . 1 . 2 . 5 Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) AFM is a powerful technique that allows to measure images of atoms in real space . Not only it has sub - nanometer high - resolution imaging capability for any type of material , but AFM has capabilities like mechanical analysis and electrical characterization measurements . Imaging and force - distance curve measurements in a physiological environment make AFM a very valuable tool for cell mechanics studies of substratum - adhered cells . Preferring AFM for mechanical analysis of cellular aggregates on peptide nanoﬁbers is feasable , although there might be certain challenges like undesired adhesions of the sample to the AFM probe and 19 limited Z range of AFM ( i . e . usually 10 µ m or 20 µ m ) for performing force curve measurements on cellular aggregates , which can typically be higher and thus diﬃcult to measure . AFM will be described in more detail in section 1 . 3 . 1 . 2 . 6 Brillouin microscopy Brillouin scattering is inelastic scattering of an incoming light with acoustic waves ( phonons ) in the sample . Confocal Brillouin microscopy is based on this scattering and the analysis of Brillouin spectrum , that can be used to obtain the Brillouin frequency shift and longitudinal modulus of the sample analyzed . It is a very new technique and is still under development . Living cells and tissues can be analyzed non - contact and thus with a less invasive way compared to the AFM . After spectrometers that contain virtually imaged phased array ( VIPA ) etalons were ﬁrst used by Scarcelli and Yun in 2008 to improve spectral contrast up to gigahertz spectral resolution [ 104 ] , popularity of Brillouin microscopy started to increase towards analysis of biomechanical properties of cells and tissues , and recently noncontact three - dimensional mapping of intracellular hydromechanical properties of living cells was demonstrated [ 105 ] . The technique has highlights for use not only in cell mechanics but also in ophthalmology [ 106 ] , and for imaging developing embryos [ 107 ] . 1 . 3 Mechanical models for cell mechanics Mechanical models directly inﬂuence characterization of the mechanical prop - erties of living cells . They are generally grouped under two main categories , which are continuum - based models and micro / nanostructural models [ 84 , 108 ] , as shown in Figure 1 . 6 . 20 Figure 1 . 6 : Mechanical models or computational approaches for analyzing the mechanical properties of cells , biomolecules and other biological materials can be listed as shown here . The ﬁgure is a reprint from [ 108 ] with permission from Nature Publishing Group . 1 . 3 . 1 Continuum mechanics models 1 . 3 . 1 . 1 Continuum based models for adhered cells The elastic model is a simpliﬁed version of viscoelastic model where viscosity ef - fects and time are not taken into consideration for calculation of elastic properties ( i . e . elastic modulus ) [ 84 ] . Elastic solid models can be divided based on linearity into two : linear elastic solid model and non - linear elastic solid model [ 108 ] . Viscoelastic modelling can be performed by combining spring elements that represent elastic deformation and dashpot elements that represent the viscosity . They can be used in combination to describe , for example , instantaneous and delayed elastic deformations [ 109 ] . Parallel combination of spring ( stiﬀness ) and dashpot ( viscosity ) is known as Kelvin Voigt element of which the elasticity determines the stationary state [ 109 ] . Combination of the two in series is known 21 as Maxwell element where a summation of contributions of elastic deformations and the viscous contributions ( that depends on time ) is taken into consideration for the Maxwell model , which is the simplest viscoelastic model [ 110 ] . There have been signiﬁcant advances in the recent decades on modelling of ad - herent cells . Rheological behavior of cytoskeleton was argued to follow soft glassy rheology model , a power law model , based on experimental investigations [ 108 ] , and then a more recent report carrying experimental work validated a poroelastic model that assumes a biphasic continuum for the behavior of cytoplasm rheology of which the cytosol as an interstitial liquid phase allows water redistribution to be plausible through a porous elastic solid phase consisting of cytoskeleton , organelles and macromolecules [ 111 ] . Even three - dimensional cell culture was argued to be only partially mimicking the in vivo tissue architecture and it was reported that the in vivo tissue follows non - linear rheological behavior [ 112 ] . 1 . 3 . 1 . 2 Continuum mechanics models for AFM analysis of adherent cells Transformation of AFM ' s force curve data to material properties like Young ' s modulus is accomplished usually by elastic solid models like Hertz contact me - chanics model and viscoelastic continuum models like power - law material models [ 113 , 114 ] . However , none of the aforementioned mechanical models can simulate every aspect of cells due to the complexity present in living matter but the ex - isting models only make approximations to the conditions and parameters . Even if that is the case , present models are somewhat good for obtaining relatively reliable values of elastic modulus values of cells , for example , Hertz contact me - chanics model has been used for ﬁtting force curves in the majority of studies that use AFM for mechanical characterization of cells , and Hertzian ﬁtting of approach curves are surprisingly well although it is a very old model originated by Heinrich Hertz , who ﬁrst produced a solution based on theory of elasticity to the deformation related problem of contact between two smooth bodies in 1881 22 [ 115 ] . Force volume mapping is very suitable for using Hertz model because it is a quasi - static mechanical analysis method , however , when a dynamic model is used where peak force tapping is involved , viscoelastic contributions should be taken into consideration for deriving the Young ' s modulus values . Moreover , with dynamic AFM modes , it is possible to obtain mechanical properties other than elastic modulus such as power - law exponent , dissipation energy , and separately the storage modulus and loss modulus . Hertz contact model assumes indenting of a linear elastic solid , an inﬁnite homogeneous half - space , on a rigid substrate surface with small indentation [ 115 , 116 ] . It was reported that Hertz model failed when applied to thin layers of soft materials like thin ( i . e . submicrometer thickness ) polymer gels [ 117 ] . It was pointed out about the conventional Hertz cone and sphere models that they worked well when applied to sectioned tissue samples with an indenting probe with a radius up to 2 . 5 µ m [ 118 ] . Regarding errors encountered at AFM data analyses , especially to that are led by Hertz model at force curves of living cells , 20 % error can be expected for rounded cells and a 10 % error can be expected for well - spread cells of MSCs and osteoblasts according to a report [ 119 ] . Lifshitz and Landau studied theory of elasticity and extended the Hertz contact mechanics model by deriving the results of Hertz ' s again and adding expressions for stress and displacement ﬁelds [ 117 ] . Love and Sneddon studied Bossinesq ' s problem for a rigid cone [ 120 , 121 ] . Bossinesq ' s problem was the ﬁrst to address the determination of the state of stress that is normal to an isotropic elastic half - space of which the load is applied [ 122 ] . Hertz model ( can also be referred as Hertz sphere model ) describes the indentation of a spherical tip to the sample and takes the radius in the calculation whereas Hertz cone model , also known as the Sneddon model , assumes that the tip geometry is conical and therefore , the calculation depends on the half - cone angle instead of the tip radius . When the tip geometry is something between a sphere and a cone , neither Hertz nor Sneddon model can truly describe the indentation measurement , where the 23 analysis and the result might possibly be wrong . To solve that problem and to rule out such a possibility , some reports like a recent one by Ros group proposed a contact model for a conical indenter with a spherical tip that took a piecewise depth - dependent ﬁtting method ( Figure 1 . 7 ) . However , as can be observed from the Figure 1 . 7D , the Sneddon model appears to work well for indentations larger than 2 µ m , as the Young ' s modulus result converges to that of the simulation modulus . Figure 1 . 7 : Sphero - conical probe A ) shown with SEM image and B ) diagram - matically drawn to describe indentation . D ) Sphero - conical ﬁtting with a contact mechanical model proposed for the sphero - conical indenter , which is shown with comparisons ﬁts of Hertz and Sneddon models , all applied to a theoretical force - indentation curve data generated by ﬁnite element analysis . The ﬁgure is a reprint from [ 123 ] . JKR ( Johnson – Kendall – Roberts ) model can be used for studying contact be - tween two spheres when strong adhesive forces are desired for consideration in conversion of force curve data to Young ' s modulus data of cells and gels [ 124 ] . Attractive forces are not included in the Hertz model . Applying JKR to retrac - tion curves makes sense for living cell samples because force curves of cells have adhesion force on the retraction curve but not on the approach curve . After a maximum load , there is a transition between Hertz to JKR model due to vis - coelasticity of cells [ 124 ] . Hydrogels were studied using Hertz model and JKR model ﬁttings to the approach and the retraction curves , respectively [ 125 ] . The diﬀerences in the results between the two approaches utilized were not too much . High crosslinked gel was measured to be 16 . 6 ± 0 . 9 kPa according to Hertz ﬁt to the approach curve and 14 . 6 ± 0 . 8 kPa based on JKR ﬁt to the retraction curve [ 125 ] . Low croslinked gel had 8 . 1 ± 0 . 4 kPa according to Hertz ﬁt to the approach curve and 6 . 02 ± 0 . 8 kPa based on JKR ﬁt to the retraction curve [ 125 ] . The 24 study used AFM for the measurement and the authors named the technique as nano - rheology because the AFM measurements were performed at the nanoscale for obtaining both the storage and loss moduli , same as the parameters obtained from a traditional rheology measurement . So , when a microsphere probe is used for the mechanical characterization of the sample , the technique can be so - named as microrheology and microindentation measurements as well . There is the issue of substrate eﬀects when AFM is used for mechanical char - acterization and it can be expected that cellular elastic modulus values might be inﬂuenced not only by the indenter but also signiﬁcantly by the substrate as well and indenting cells on stiﬀ substrates may lead to overestimation of Young ' s modulus values while indenting cells on much softer substrates might end up with signiﬁcant underestimations . Interestingly , in a recent report , multi - cellular nodule formation of ﬁbroblasts was present on substrates having elastic modulus values less then the elastic moduli of ﬁbroblasts but the ﬁbroblasts did not form multi - cellular nodules on glass coverslip and instead were as single cells , where polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates were used with diﬀering elasticity values of 0 . 3 kPa , 0 . 5 kPa , 1 . 4 kPa in the study [ 126 ] . On 1 . 4 kPa polyacrylamide sub - strate , there were nodules ﬁrst and then plaques of the cells in the following days [ 126 ] , which may imply that there is a tendency within the cell population to form spheroids when the substrate is soft while there are more single cells and monolay - ers of cells on stiﬀ substrates like glass coverslip . As such , cellular behavior might change on diﬀerent matrices and hence cellular aggregates like spheroids might need to be treated diﬀerently from single cells and monolayers of cells on ﬂat , stiﬀ substrates like bare glass coverslip when AFM based mechanical measure - ments are preferred and their analysis using contact mechanics models is to be done so that a better approximation to the cellular responses during indentation measurements can be achieved if suitable modiﬁcations can be done to existing mechanical models or even new models can be suggested for such special cases . While contact models typically consider only the interaction between the probe and sample , Glaubitz et al . developed a bipartite contact model that accounts for sample deformation due to both the indenting probe and the pressure expressed by the substrate underneath the sample [ 116 ] . Accordingly , the Hertz model 25 was employed to describe the probe - sample interaction while the JKR model was used for sample - substrate interactions . This ”mixed double contact model” might especially be useful for microindentation analysis of spherical cellular aggregates , as the error it addresses depends on the radius of the indenter , the sample and the substrate [ 116 ] . Although AFM studies mostly use linear elastic or linear viscoelastic models for calculation of mechanical properties of cells , non - linear viscoelastic models are also sometimes studied . For example , a recent report targeted viscoelastic identiﬁcation of breast cancer cells and involved measurement of the shear re - laxation modulus and determination of the nonlinear elastic contributions , for which a neo - Hookean model was used in the report , and also came up with a novel inverse analysis of results of AFM indentations [ 127 ] . Brush model was proposed by Sokolov group to achieve consistency in quan - titative use of AFM for characterization of Young ' s modulus values of cells to utilize as a marker [ 128 , 129 , 130 ] . Assuming that cell is a spherical object and the cell surface brush is softer than the cell itself , the model separates the elas - tic deformation of the cell body from the elastic deformation of the brush layer [ 130 ] . The same group proposed a double - brush layer model in a recent study with ﬁbroblast cells in which the AFM tip ﬁrst encounters long , hyaluronan - based pericellular brushes followed by a brush layer of corrugated cell membrane [ 131 ] . As such , derivation of elastic modulus has been considered challenging not only due to the presence of non - linearity , that is , the cell is acting like an elastic solid at small deformations and behaving as a viscous liquid - like body , but also due to the complexity of the nanoscale outer layers of cell surface brushes might require some use of advanced mechanical models for quantitative , accurate and reliable determination of the mechanical responses by better exploiting and ﬁtting diﬀer - ent regions of the force curves measured on the cells . Measured Young ' s modulus values can diﬀer signiﬁcantly depending on the frequency used during force curve measurements . Higher frequencies , such as those used in peak force tapping mode measurements , have been associated with higher Young ' s modulus values of single cells , indicating an overestimation of the 26 values [ 132 ] . One reason for that may be because the cells cannot see the tip and properly respond to it at such high frequency measurements . AFM can be used to determine cortical tension of adherent cells from force curve data . Tension model , developed by Sen et al . [ 133 ] , was used in a study where epithelial cells were used and their mesenchymal - like state was character - ized based on the changes of tension due to loss of intercellular junctions , and approach curve was ﬁtted based on the tension model to derive the compressibility modulus and the tension [ 134 ] . 1 . 3 . 1 . 3 Continuum based models for suspended cells Micropipette aspiration technique and optical tweezers have commonly been used for both non - adherent cells and adherent cells in suspension . A suitable model for deriving the mechanical properties of cells from such experiments can be liquid drop models , where the cells are considered to behave like spherical liquid drops . For example , cortical shell - liquid models like Newtonian liquid drop model in which the membrane cortex is modelled to have a certain tension and the cell body as a droplet body [ 84 ] , were developed mainly for studying deformabil - ity of neutrophils and determining their cytoplasmic viscosity via micropipette aspiration [ 135 , 136 ] . In a recent report that used micropipette aspiration of cells of Dictyostelium , social amoeba , three models were examined for deformations of diﬀerent extents , linear viscoelastic model and liquid drop model with a tense cortex for small deformations , and a third model for large deformations which was Newtonian viscous ﬂuid model [ 137 ] . In a report that used optical tweezers for mechanical characterization of suspended Jurkat cells , a model based on membrane theory was used [ 138 ] . In another report that preferred using a microﬂuidic platform for probing cell stiﬀness at high - throughput , a real - time deformability cytometry ( RT - DC ) was used to study suspended cells where a perturbation approach was used for calculating the elastic deformation via ﬁrst - order approximation and by assuming that the cells were linear elastic and isotropic solid spheres [ 139 ] . This 27 study compared cell stiﬀness values of a human promyelocytic HL60 leukemia cell line measured by AFM and RT - DC , where the results were E = 170 ± 85 Pa ( N = 169 ) and E = 1 : 47 ± 0 : 51 kPa ( N = 281 , mean ± SD ) , respectively [ 139 ] . In studies that investigated the viscoelastic behavior of human MSCs ( hMSCs ) , a linear viscoelastic solid model was preferred for the micropipette measurements , that assumed the pressure applied was uniform and the cell had incompressibil - ity , where the viscosity and Young ' s modulus of the cells being measured were derived [ 86 , 140 ] . In a study carried out by Maloney et al . , optical stretching was used for analyzing hMSCs in the suspended state whose creep compliance measurements were performed and the authors concluded that hMSCs showed power - law rheology behavior as a result of stretching and recovery measurements where they were both modelled with a single exponent [ 141 ] . 1 . 3 . 2 Micro / nanoscale approach Tensegrity is a building design principle term coined by Buckminister Fuller [ 142 ] . The term is a combination of tension and integrity and describes a network of tensed structural elements that resist shape distortion and stabilize the overall shape by resisting to compression by the use of tensile prestresses [ 142 , 143 ] . Cellular tensegrity model proposes a prestressed inhomogeneous model where the cells generate prestresses by contractile elements of cytoskeleton such as actins to balance the tensile forces coming from other structural components of the cytoskeleton [ 144 , 145 , 146 ] . In this model , mechanical forces can be transferred fastly over long - distances on the order of miliseconds , quicker than the diﬀusion based transfer of chemical signals [ 145 ] . Two - dimensional cable network model was proposed to study the eﬀects of propagation of intracellular stresses on focal adhesion distributions where the ca - bles ( i . e . actins ) are prestressed due to tension but does not show resistance to compression unlike the cellular tensegrity model [ 147 , 148 ] . Other than cable network and tensegrity models , there is open cell foam model for modelling of adherent cells using micro / nanoscale approaches . In all these three models , the 28 elastic modulus can be calculated based on the mechanical properties of cytoskele - tal elements [ 149 ] . In a study where the cellular elastic moduli were calculated and compared based on these three models , open cell foam model gave higher val - ues ( 10 3 - 10 4 Pa ) than the elastic moduli value that cable network and tensegrity models resulted ( 10 1 - 10 2 Pa ) [ 149 ] . There are simulation based network models like molecular dynamics simu - lations that are usually preferred for studying biomolecular mechanics [ 123 ] . Monte - Carlo simulations can be used to study elastic modulus and equilibrium conditions of overall tissue constructs that contain cells and ECM [ 150 ] . 1 . 4 Behind the AFM 1 . 4 . 1 History Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer ﬁrst developed scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) in 1981 , which earned them jointly half of the Nobel Prize in Physics 1986 . The other half was awarded to Ernst Ruska for the electron microscope . In 1986 , AFM was invented by Binnig , Christoph Gerber and Calvin Quate [ 151 ] . AFM uses cantilever sensors as probes which typically has a sharp tip at its end , typically cone or pyramid shaped and having a nanoscale sized apex , which allows contouring non - conducting materials . In recent years , a tremendous progress on measuring AFM images in real - time has been made by researchers , and also recent developments on high - speed AFM technology have allowed to obtain an AFM image at the video frame rate . AFM has become a versatile platform for manipulating single - molecules and living cells [ 152 ] . Simplicity of AFM tempered researchers not only to establish various imaging modes and append more capability to the AFM such as elec - trical , magnetic , chemical characterizations but also master existing modes by customizing and improving them , establishing new techniques and methodoloical approaches [ 153 ] . Furthermore , various AFM probes have been designed and 29 fabricated to better image and characterize the samples via AFM [ 154 , 155 ] . Gerd Binnig , Christoph Gerber and Calvin Quate was awarded 2016 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience “for the invention and realization of atomic force microscopy , a breakthrough in measurement technology and nanosculpting that continues to have a transformative impact on nanoscience and technology” [ 156 ] . 1 . 4 . 2 Working principles In principle , AFM is STM plus stylus proﬁlometer [ 151 ] . STM can only measure conductive samples but AFM can measure any materials including insulators and conductors , and AFM can perform the measurements not only in air but also in liquid environment . Both STM and AFM can operate in ultra - high vacuum environment . AFM allows atomic resolution imaging of any type of material and its mechanical analysis at the micro - and nanoscales . AFM tip or the sample is raster scanned and a three - dimensional topography map is obtained with a very precise height information of the sample . AFM has two basic working modes : contact - mode ( DC mode ) and noncontact - mode ( AC mode ) . Tapping mode is a noncontact - mode where AFM tip scans the surface of the sample via intermittent contacts with constant oscillation amplitude or frequency whereas in contact - mode AFM , the tip slides on the surface always in full contact position during scanning . Levering can either be optical or mechanical in an AFM system whereas optical levering and detection is mostly preferred in the commercial microscopes . Laser is aligned on the back of the cantilever and the reﬂected laser light goes to quadrant photodetector ( Figure 1 . 7 ) . Deﬂection of the cantilever is calculated based on the angle of reﬂection and the position of the laser on the photodetector . All signals are recorded in voltage units including the force , and then they are converted to other units ( i . e . Newton for force , meter for distance ) . AFM is a very sensitive sensor with attoNewton ( 10 - 18 N ) sensitivity [ 151 ] . There are both sample scanning ( e . g . Asylum Research MFP - 3D AFM , Bruker AFMs ) and probe - scanning AFMs ( e . g . JPK Instruments 30 Figure 1 . 8 : A ) AFM schematic diagram was reproduced with permission [ 157 ] .

D ) Force mapping illustrated and E ) a force curve example with respective steps of cantilever movements .

Young ' s modulus ( or elastic modulus ) is the ability of a material to elasti - cally resist to deformation under an applied force or in other words , it is a one - dimensional property deﬁned as the ratio of the stress applied to the material ( along an axis ) over the strain ( at the same axis ) . Young ' s modulus is a measure of stiﬀness and has the same units as the pressure ( stress ) because the strain is dimensionless as it is the ratio of deformation over an initial reference length . Force - distance curve measurements ( Figure 1 . 7E ) allow calculation of Young ' s modulus upon indentation to various materials from soft biological cells at the kilopascal ( kPa ) to hard materials like steel at hundreds of gigapascal ( GPa ) Young ' s modulus values ( Figure 1 . 8 ) . Figure 1 . 9 : Young ' s modulus scale of various materials , adapted from [ 159 ] . Scales are logarithmic . Force mapping , also called force volume mapping , is recording an array of force curves with a grid pattern in a pixel - by - pixel manner from a speciﬁed area of the sample [ 158 , 160 ] ( Figure 1 . 7D ) . It is a quasi - static analysis mode of the AFM and allows both obtaining the topography information of the sample and the calculation of elasticity map ( or Young ' s modulus map ) when a contact me - chanics model like Hertz model is applied for ﬁtting the force curves afterwards ( after ﬁnishing the measurement ) . Most of the modern AFMs are capable of si - multaneously obtaining the force curves while scanning the sample , named force scanning [ 161 ] , and this capability allows performing dynamic mechanical analy - sis and obtaining Young ' s modulus image of the sample in real - time when using , 32 for example , the tapping mode . Peak Force Tapping Quantitative Nanomechani - cal Mapping ( QNM ) of Bruker and Contact Resonance Mode of Asylum Research and Quantitative Imaging ( QI ) mode of JPK Nanowizard are some examples to such a capability . Force mapping is quite slow when compared to force scanning when same resolution measurements are desired . For instance , a high - resolution 2056 x 2056 force map would take 1 . 5 years to ﬁnish the measurement while com - pletion of a force scanning measurement with the same resolution would only take an hour [ 161 ] . On the other hand , because AFM performs ramping in one dimen - sion , that is Z , during force mapping , it might be more suitable for measurement of force curves for more precise determination of the Young ' s modulus of the sample than the force scanning because Young ' s modulus is a one - dimensional term as aforementioned in this subsection whereas force scanning or Peak Force QNM modes require movement of the AFM tip at both X and Z directions at the same time , while taking the force curve measurements . 1 . 4 . 3 Elastic modulus characterization studies of os - teogenic diﬀerentiating MSCs in the literature The ﬁeld of cell mechanics and its relation to cell and development biology , phys - iology , nanophysiology are very important and are still growing as many groups continue to explore more of the nanoworld and the microscopic world . As such , cellular diﬀerentiation might be inﬂuencing the cellular mechanical properties and since AFM is the most frequently preferred tool for characterization of elas - tic modulus of substratum - adherent cells , I hereby applied AFM ' s force mapping capability to osteogenic diﬀerentiating MSCs on peptide nanoﬁber - coated glass substrates and tried to characterize Young ' s modulus changes throughout the diﬀerentiation process . In general , cells , both single cells and multicellular or - ganisms , and tissues have widely been measured by using AFM and some of such studies are listed in a study by our group as well [ 162 ] . However , AFM based elas - tic modulus characterization of cellular aggregates and spheroids is still lacking and Young ' s modulus of cells on peptide nanoﬁbers also has not been character - ized using AFM so far to my knowledge and observation . Hence , here I focused on 33 AFM measured elastic modulus characterization studies of the MSCs , osteoblasts and osteogenic diﬀerentiating cells , and gave an overview about what has been done on the subject . MSCs were reported to have around 2 kPa ( 1 . 9 kPa of spherical cells and 2 . 4 kPa of spread cells ) Young ' s modulus on poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) coated polystyrene Petri dishes whereas Young ' s modulus of osteoblasts vary from 2 to 5 kPa Young ' s modulus values ( 2 . 0 kPa of spherical and 5 . 8 kPa of spread cells ) [ 163 ] , where the cells were not allowed for diﬀerentiation . But when MSCs are allowed to diﬀer - entiate into the osteogenic lineage for a certain duration , a signiﬁcant decrease in their Young ' s modulus values is detected as a result of AFM force measurements [ 164 , 165 ] . Young ' s modulus of hMSCs dropped from 3 . 2 ± 1 . 4 kPa to 2 . 1 ± 0 . 9 kPa within a period of 10 days in the study by Titushkin et al . , and hMSCs had ∼ 2 . 8 kPa elastic modulus and diﬀerentiated human osteoblasts had ∼ 1 . 4 kPa , and around 30 cells were measured for each day of osteogenic diﬀerentiation analyzed in the study by Bongiorno et al . , as also shown in Table 1 . 1 . However , whether these results are representative of in vivo is an important point . Grow - ing the cells on ECM or ECM mimetic materials such as peptide nanoﬁbers and performing the measurements in situ might be helpful to approximate the actual Young ' s modulus values of cells in vivo . Osteogenic diﬀerentiation of MSCs have been studied by cultivating them in the presence of bioactive peptide nanoﬁbers [ 167 , 168 , 169 , 170 , 171 ] . How - ever , mechanical characterization of MSCs diﬀerentiating on bioactive peptide nanoﬁbers remains to be poorly investigated . An analysis of cells at single cell level is needed , separately from peptide nanoﬁbers . Traditional rheometer is not suitable for measurements at single cell level because it is used for analysis of bulk materials ( i . e . peptides and cells combined ) , hence it might be diﬃcult to distinguish individual cell elasticity . For instance , in a very recent study where a micron - scale parallel - plate compression test system was used for measuring em - bryonic stem cell aggregates incorporated with mineral - coated gelatin microparti - cles , the authors of the study noted that the compression test they performed only made it possible to measure bulk mechanical properties of entire aggregates that were composed of the stem cells and the gelatin microparticles , and that they 34 Matrix / substrate Culture medium Cell type E ( kPa ) Ref .

BM - MSCs : bone marrow - derived MSCs , P indicates the passage number of the cells , TCPS : tissue culture polystyrene . were both counted in the results of the measurement [ 172 ] . Advantageously , AFM can measure mechanical properties of substratum - adhered individual cells and it has been preferred in most of the experiments for the characterization of Young ' s modulus of adherent cells where Young ' s modulus of the cells can be ob - tained from the force - distance curves . Moreover , AFM can also be used to obtain complex modulus of cells using power - law rheology approach [ 173 , 174 ] . Peptide amphiphile hydrogels loaded with cells were previously analyzed using traditional bulk rheology [ 175 ] , however , there is a lack of single - cell level Young ' s modulus characterization of stem cells on peptide nanoﬁber hydrogels . Elucidation of stem cell mechanics on the peptide nanoﬁber hydrogels may help obtaining Young ' s modulus values nearer to in vivo values of cells and lead to a better analysis of mechanical markers and understanding the relationships between mechanical 35 responses and events during cellular diﬀerentiation . 1 . 5 Bioactive peptide nanoﬁbers as osteoinduc - tive biomaterials 1 . 5 . 1 What is a peptide amphiphile ? Peptide amphiphile ( PA ) molecules are a class of self - assembling peptides that have a hydrophilic alkyl tail attached to the peptide part ( Figures 1 . 9 and 1 . 13A ) and they can be designed to produce well - deﬁned molecular and nanoscale archi - tectures that allow bioactivity in the presence of bioactive sequences or bioactive ligands as epitopes [ 167 ] . Figure 1 . 10 : Chemical structure of a peptide amphiphile ( PA ) molecule with its chemical formula ( A ) and space - ﬁlling model ( B ) , a hypothetical self - assembled nanoﬁber structure ( C ) , nanoﬁber - containing bundles ( D ) . Illustration is reprinted with permission from [ 176 ] . As diﬀerentiation of MSCs into a speciﬁc lineage can be induced by chemicals , biological factors and mechanical stimuli within the environment of the cells [ 177 , 36 178 , 179 ] , PA molecules can be designed to obtain self - assembled nanostructures ( e . g . nanoﬁbers , nanospheres ) deﬁned via non - covalent interactions [ 180 ] and can be used as well for manipulating the diﬀerentiation of MSCs by providing bioactive peptide nanostructures to the niche of the MSCs [ 167 , 169 , 170 , 181 , 182 , 183 , 184 , 185 ] . PA nanoﬁbers are also promising biomaterials for local MSC delivery to patients with traumatic injuries and chronic diseases . 1 . 5 . 2 Osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers A bioactive PA molecule that contains Glu - Glu - Glu ( EEE ) sequence was ﬁrst studied by Stupp group for manipulation of diﬀerentiation of MSCs into os - teogenic lineage [ 184 ] . The bioactive EEE sequence is found in the structures of BSP protein , that is , an osteogenic marker protein and its expression helps the formation of an osteoblastic cell morphology , which can be an important pa - rameter for characterization of osteogenic diﬀerentiation of bone marrow derived MSCs [ 54 ] . Osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers that contain E 3 - PA molecules were shown to induce bone - like mineral nucleation when human MSCs ( hMSCs ) were cultivated on them [ 167 ] . E 3 - PA bearing peptide nanoﬁbers promoted calcium mineral deposition of hMSCs better than other PA groups utilized in the study ( Figure 1 . 10 ) . Later , our research group reported that MSCs can commit to os - teogenic diﬀerentiation on E 3 - PA bearing peptide nanoﬁbers better than DGEA peptide [ 168 ] , which is found in the cell binding domain of collagen I , thus known to have a promoting eﬀect on osteogenic diﬀerentiation of MSCs [ 186 ] . Glycosaminoglycan mimetic peptide nanoﬁbers were shown to induce migra - tion of Saos - 2 cells ( human osteosarcoma cell line ) and formation of spheroids , and promoted mineralization by the cells ( Figure 1 . 11 ) . Recently , the same glycosaminoglycan mimetic peptide nanoﬁbers were also shown to promote osteogenic diﬀerentiation of rat MSCs ( rMSCs ) in vitro ( Figure 1 . 12 ) , and enhanced bone regeneration and biomineralization process in vivo in a rabbit tibial bone defect model [ 171 ] . In that study , a tendency of rMSCs to form cell clusters was observed at day 14 in the SEM image and confocal ﬂuorescence 37 Figure 1 . 11 : Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity of hMSCs in the presence of PA groups applied ( A ) and calcium deposition by the cells on the PA groups indicated , revealing that E 3 - PA better enhances the biomineralization abilities of the cells ( C ) , and SEM images of cell - seeded PA nanoﬁber - coatings bundles formed from the nanoﬁbers are shown below ( B ) .

E - PA / K - PA was assumed / considered as a nonbioactive PA in the study . Another example to the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers are the peptide nanoﬁbers that mimic ﬁbronectin binding domain of tenascin - C protein , which were reported to promote the osteogenic diﬀerentiation of rMSCs [ 170 ] . In this study , commitment of MSCs on the tenascin - C mimetic peptide nanoﬁbers were conﬁrmed at late stage of osteogenic diﬀerentiation via detection of higher level of osteopontin and collagen I gene expressions [ 170 ] . At the early stage , osteogenic diﬀerentiation of rMSCs was conﬁrmed by ALP assay and for late stage assay Alizarin red staining was also used to show the mineralization proﬁle ( Figure 1 . 13 ) . 38 Figure 1 . 12 : Schematic drawing at the top summarizes the eﬀect of the gly - cosaminoglycan ( GAG ) mimetic PA ( SO 3 - PA ) on behavior of Saos - 2 cells .

EEE sequence bearing osteoinductive PA ( E 3 - PA ) molecule was mixed with an oppo - sitely charged PA molecule having the same backbone sequence , Lauryl - VVAG , followed by a triple lysine sequence ( KKK ) instead to enhance nanoﬁber self - assembly . Charge neutralization and electrostatic interactions make it easier to form β - sheet secondary structure , thus nanoﬁber formation , even at low con - centrations . Very recently , electron microscopy images of nanoﬁber structures composed of a mixture of these two individual PAs , also named as E 3 / K 3 - PA , were reported by our group ( Figure 1 . 14 ) . Here , eﬀectiveness of E 3 / K 3 - PA for promoting the osteogenic diﬀerentiation and biomineralization of rMSCs was in - vestigated in vitro and AFM was used for force mapping of rMSCs on the peptide nanoﬁbers at diﬀerent days of osteogenic diﬀerentiation to characterize Young ' s modulus changes of the cells throughout the diﬀerentiation process . Results were intriguing for better understanding the mechanical properties of MSCs at the osteochondral lineage because of approximating to their native state , and ended up with identiﬁcation of biophysical markers related to osteoprogenitor cells , pre - osteoblasts , osteoblasts and osteocytes . An appropriate matrix stiﬀness should be provided to MSCs to have a better control at engineering their fate using biomaterials . Because cells mechanically feel and sense their environment , diﬀerentiating cells act with respect to incoming signals from the surroundings by rearranging activities of cell signaling within the cell . For instance , YAP / TAZ proteins were shown to play a signiﬁcant role in the progress of osteogenic diﬀerentiation and they were also shown to be activated in the nucleus of MSCs on a stiﬀ substrate with 40 kPa stiﬀness [ 190 , 191 ] . For osteogenic diﬀerentiation to occur eﬃciently , a suitable substrate stiﬀness ( i . e . close to osteoid matrix ) and presence of cell - cell contact were both demonstrated to be important requirements [ 25 ] . According to Discher group , osteoblast calci - ﬁcation on 2D gels would occur better within an elastic modulus range of 20 - 100 kPa [ 29 ] . 42 Figure 1 . 15 : Chemical structures of E 3 - PA and K 3 - PA molecules ( a ) , zeta po - tential measurement result ( b ) , hydrogel appearance in an upside down tube ( c ) , SEM image of 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) ( d ) , TEM images ( e and f ) of 1 % ( w / v ) E 3 / K 3 - PA . ( f ) is reprinted from [ 188 ] with permission , other parts of the ﬁgure are reprint from [ 189 ] with permission . I included both TEM images of E 3 / K 3 - PA because Cinar et al . ' s TEM image has nanosheet like structures but Zengin et al . ' s TEM image does not have those nanosheets . 1 . 6 What are the attributes of cells that inﬂu - ence their mechanical properties ? Cytoskeletal elements are known to be key players that might change the bulk elastic modulus of a cell . John M . Maloney found that MSCs eﬀectively stiﬀen in response to detachment of substratum - adherent cells from substrate surface within one hour [ 22 ] . Regarding to osteogenic diﬀerentiation of MSCs , sev - eral research groups reported that substrate - adhered MSCs underwent softening throughout osteogenic diﬀerentiation [ 192 , 164 ] . Here I argue that MSCs might increase their Young ' s moduli on osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers when diﬀer - entiating into the osteogenic lineage . Mineralization might be an important factor to obtain diﬀerentiating cells with increased stiﬀness proﬁles during osteogenic diﬀerentiation . Subbiah et al . used gelatin matrix to study cell mechanics during 43 diﬀerentiation of pre - osteoblast MC3T3 cells into osteoblasts and found that cell stiﬀness increased correlated to increased matrix mineralization [ 193 ] . Eﬀect of mineralization on osteoblast stiﬀening might overcome inﬂuences of cytoskeletal elements which are known as main determinants of the mechanical properties of cells . Actin ﬁlaments are one of the most important factors that can modulate cell stiﬀness as they likely have important inﬂuences on cell mechanics via dynamic rearrangements [ 194 ] . Amount and length of the ﬁbers may aﬀect the stiﬀness proﬁle of a cell , however , alignment and thickness of actin and myosin ﬁlaments were found to have a less order in contribution or have no direct relation to the cell stiﬀness [ 195 ] . Myosin motor proteins are known to enable contraction of actin arrays including stress ﬁbers [ 196 ] . Cell cortex has gel - like mesh network of actins [ 196 ] . Cell surface tension is regulated by both actin cortex and myosin - driven stresses [ 197 ] . Contractility and alignment of actin and myosin networks were pointed out to be important for mechanical interplay in tissue shaping by the cells [ 198 ] . Mechanical response of stress ﬁbers was reported to be remarkably greater than mechanical response of cytosol according to AFM - based measure - ment results : stiﬀness of actin ﬁbers was reported as 11 . 3 kPa whereas cytosolic region had a stiﬀness of 2 kPa , both values in average [ 199 ] . There is not suﬃcient quantitative information on how actin ﬁber thickening inﬂuences cell stiﬀness . Recently , recovery of actins was shown to occur near - instantaneously in the study carried by Andrew Pelling group , where cell membrane recovery happened within a few minutes after a large deformation was introduced [ 200 ] . Cell nucleoskeletal components like lamin , emerin and SUN proteins , nuclear pore complexes and chromatin organization were reported to actively modulate nuclear mechanics [ 201 ] . 44 Chapter 2 Design of custom atomic force microscope ( AFM ) probes for imaging and force mapping of live cells 2 . 1 Study background and hypothesis AFM probe choice is very important in biological sampling . For live cell AFM imaging , spring constant of cantilevers should be suﬃciently low that the cells should not be harmed via plastic deformations when the tip contacts the cells repeatedly . 0 . 01 N / m to 0 . 1 N / m spring constants are typical values for mea - surements of force curves and force maps . Young ' s moduli of cells remain typically between 0 . 1 kPa and 100 kPa . Adhesion of the tip to the sample is unwanted ; thus , antifouling probe design would be helpful for getting easier and more re - peatable AFM measurements and images . Both nanoscale sharp tips ( i . e . usually 5 - 10 nm ) and colloidal probes with micron scale diameters ( e . g . 2 . 5 µ m and 5 µ m ) have been preferred very frequently in the literature . Another parameter to be considered in the probe selection would be resonant frequency of the cantilever . 45 For example , a high - speed AFM would need a MHz scale frequency and would usually have a very small cantilever size . In this thesis , a Teﬂon - like thin ﬁlm was coated to a contact mode silicon nitride AFM probe . The coated probes were used for AFM imaging and force mapping of live mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) . 2 . 2 Materials and methods 2 . 2 . 1 Fabrication of AFM probes with Teﬂon - like coating Pyramidal silicon nitride ( SiNi ) AFM probes ( purchased from Budget Sensors , Bulgaria ) were coated with a Teﬂon - like ﬂuoropolymer thin ﬁlm via an Inductively Coupled Plasma ( ICP ) . The coating process was performed with C 4 F 8 plasma for 10 min at a rate of 80 sccm . A power of 400 W was used . 2 . 2 . 2 SEM imaging The coated AFM probe was placed on a double - sided sticky carbon tape sticked on an SEM stub . A FEI Quanta 200 FEG SEM with an ETD detector in high vacuum mode was used for acquiring the images . Working distance was set to 10 mm . SEM ' s stage was tilted 40 ° . 2 . 2 . 3 Contact angle measurement Droplets of water and ethylene glycol were dropped on a C 4 F 8 coated silicon wafer piece via micropipette . Measurements were conducted with a custom contact angle measurement device setup . 46 2 . 2 . 4 AFM imaging Rat MSCs at passage 7 were imaged . About 75 % conﬂuent sample ( good cell sample for AFM imaging ) and an overconﬂuent sample ( challenging for AFM imaging ) of rMSCs were imaged in growth medium solution ( contains low glucose Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) , 10 % Fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin antibiotics ) . 2 . 3 Results and discussion 2 . 3 . 1 Characterization of Teﬂon - like coated AFM probes A sphero - conical shape was obtained at the tip apex as a result of Teﬂon - like thin ﬁlm coating as analyzed by SEM imaging ( Figure 2 . 1A and 2 . 1B ) . Contact angle measurements showed that the coating was highly hydrophobic with a water droplet contact angle of 110 ° and ethylene glycol contact angle of 62 ° ( Figure 2 . 1C and 2 . 1D ) . 2 . 3 . 2 AFM imaging and force mapping of live cells via AFM probes with Teﬂon - like coating Teﬂon - like thin ﬁlm coated silicon nitride AFM probes ( Budget Sensors ) , same as the coated probe shown in Figure 2 . 1 , were used for live cell AFM imaging of a conﬂuent sample of rat mesenchymal stem cells ( rMSCs ) at passage P7 at a res - olution of 1024 x 256 ( Points x Lines ) ( Fig 2 . 2 ) . Since there are great diﬀerences at the position of cytoskeletal images between Trace and Retrace images , it can be claimed that AFM tip disturbs the cell while scanning . Even so , the cytoskele - tal elements are distinguishable on the images obtained from such a challenging ( conﬂuent ) live cell sample for AFM imaging . 47 Figure 2 . 1 : ( A , B ) SEM images of Teﬂon - like ﬁlm coated silicon nitride AFM tip . Diameter of the tip apex is 318 . 8 nm . ( C ) Contact - angle measurement result of a water droplet on the silicon surface with same coating . Force mapping was tried with the Teﬂon - like coated SiNi probes from the same rMSC sample ( Fig . 2 . 3 ) , which showed that the coated tips were reliable for force mapping measurements . Tapping mode imaging on live rMSCs was achieved without too much disturb - ing the cells ( Fig . 2 . 4 ) . After observing that these probes can be used conﬁrming reliable usage for both scanning and force mapping measurements , it was de - cided to continue using them for mechanical characterization of rMSC osteogenic diﬀerentiating on the peptide nanoﬁbers . 48 Figure 2 . 2 : AFM images of conﬂuent rMSCs using Teﬂon - like thin ﬁlm coated AFM probes . 49 Figure 2 . 3 : 64 x 64 force map measurement trial using Teﬂon - like coated AFM probes . Young ' s modulus map and a representative force curve with ﬁt ( black dashed line ) were obtained via ﬁtting approach curves based on Hertz Cone model . 2 . 3 . 3 Optimization of Teﬂon - like thin ﬁlm coating recipe at ICP There was a bending problem which caused the sum signal to decrease during measurements ( Figure 2 . 5 ) . Even tough there was bending at the bright region , it was possible to gather nice AFM images with these Teﬂon - like probes even from an overconﬂuent sample as shown in Figure 2 . 2 and also smooth force curves as shown in Figures 2 . 3 . The laser of AFM was shined on a dark region of the back of the cantilever ( dark regions allowed having high sum signals as usual ) , and the force mapping experiments were performed with the coated probes and the measurements were successful . Because some of the coated probes showed the bending problem , I tried to obtain non - bending AFM probes coated with C 4 F 8 material . Whether a high temperature caused the bending problem during the process at ICP due to high 50 power was suspected . So , the process was optimized eventually by trying at a lower power , 150 W , and for a longer coating duration , 45 min . At AFM , in aqueous environment , the probe showed no bending at all with the 150 W optimization ( Figure 2 . 6 ) . 150 W , 45 min coated SiNi probe was imaged with SEM ( Figure 2 . 6A ) and HUVEC imaging was done using the same probe afterwards ( Figure 2 . 6B ) . SEM image was measured tilted and no bending was observed at the cantilever , and the coating was conﬁrmed . AFM images showed that the probe coated at 150 W for 45 min was able to image HUVECs although the sample was somewhat challenging because of greater heights of the cells ( they are bigger than MSCs ) . 2 . 4 Conclusion Custom AFM probes with anti - fouling properties were designed by coating the silicon nitride probes with octaﬂuorocyclobutane and used in the high resolu - tion AFM imaging of live cells and for investigating the mechanical properties of cells during cellular diﬀerentiation . Antifouling properties of Teﬂon - like ﬂuo - ropolymer octaﬂuorocyclobutane coated probes allowed measurement of smooth force - distance curves on living cells . Imaging results showed that nicely prepared live cell samples could be measured to obtain AFM images with good resolution and quality , and with minimal tip disturbances on the cell , and that overconﬂu - ent cells could also be successfully imaged using these probes . Cell nucleus can be easily identiﬁed from phase images and cytoskeletal elements can be seen in the images as well . Optimization of deposition recipe of C 4 F 8 plasma at ICP using lower power ( i . e . 150 W ) and a longer duration helped solving the bending problem observed at some of the cantilevers coated at 400 W . 51 Figure 2 . 4 : Tapping mode AFM images of less conﬂuent rMSCs measured using Teﬂon - like coated SiNi AFM probes . Images were obtained without too much disturbing rMSCs . The resolution of the images is 1024 x 256 ( Points x Lines ) . 52 Figure 2 . 5 : Bending problem of Teﬂon - like probes fabricated with a power of 400 W at ICP . The laser is shined on a dark region of the back of the cantilever and high sum signals can still be obtained like 4 V . When the bright region is shined , a very low sum signal like 1 V is obtained and AFM analysis is not possible . The probe is in liquid , in the cell culture medium and the sample is osteospheroid rMSCs on peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel coated on glass coverslip . 53 Figure 2 . 6 : Appearance of AFM probe coated at 150 W in aqueous environment ; the bending problem was solved . No bright region is observed after optimization of the deposition recipe at ICP . 54 Figure 2 . 7 : A ) SEM images of 150 W coated probe and B ) AFM images of live HUVECs measured using the same probe via tapping mode imaging in cell culture medium . 55 Chapter 3 Force mapping and Alizarin red staining reveal that Young ' s moduli of diﬀerentiating mesenchymal stem cells increase with biomineralization on osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers This work is partially described in the following publication : Topal , A . E . et al . Nanomechanical Characterization of Osteogenic Diﬀeren - tiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Bioactive Peptide Nanoﬁber Hydrogels . Advanced Materials Interfaces 1700090 ( 2017 ) . doi : 10 . 1002 / admi . 201700090 56 3 . 1 Study background and hypothesis Mechanical properties of MSCs and osteogenic diﬀerentiating cells have been in - vestigated before on glass substrate or on Petri dishes , however , there is still need for better investigating the mechanical properties of MSCs that are cultured in an extracellular matrix - like environment and diﬀerentiating into osteogenic lineage . Mechanical mapping of adherent cells can be done via force mapping capability of AFM . Most of such mechanical characterization studies in the literature that calculate Young ' s modulus of adherent cells are performed using AFM . Here , I studied Young ' s moduli of rat MSCs ( rMSCs ) diﬀerentiating on bioactive peptide nanoﬁbers by using AFM , of which , I believe there is room for more investiga - tion . I expect that this study might contribute to elaboration of mechanical behavior of MSCs diﬀerentiating into osteogenic lineage in vivo . Furthermore , a mechanical marker for osteogenic diﬀerentiation can be suggested based on the Young ' s modulus of cells . Although stiﬀness of a material changes based on its geometry , Young ' s moduli of materials are independent of their geometry be - cause Young ' s modulus is an intensive property unlike the stiﬀness , which is an extensive property . Which factors do have an inﬂuence on the Young ' s mod - uli of cells ? Most studies that analyze local Young ' s modulus of cells attribute changes to cytoskeletal elements due to their dynamic rearrangements . There rises a question for diﬀerentiating bone cells that whether calcium mineraliza - tion during osteogenic diﬀerentiation might inﬂuence Young ' s modulus of cells as well . Only one study has attributed an increase of Young’s modulus of MSCs to mineralization so far [ 193 ] . In this thesis work , I intended to investigate mechan - ical properties of MSCs diﬀerentiating on osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers by characterizing Young ' s moduli of the cells using AFM ' s force mapping capability . 57 3 . 2 Materials and methods 3 . 2 . 1 Design and synthesis of peptide amphiphile ( PA ) molecules Two peptide amphiphile ( PA ) molecules , Lauryl - VVAGEEE ( E 3 - PA ) and Lauryl - VVAGKKK - Am ( K 3 - PA ) ( Figure 3 . 1 ) , were synthesized using Fmoc - solid - phase peptide synthesis . E 3 - PA was constructed on Fmoc - Glu ( OtBu ) - Wang resin ( 100 - 200 mesh ) from Novabiochem ® whereas Rink Amide MBHA resin ( 100 - 200 mesh ) from Novabiochem ® was used as solid support for K 3 - PA . Automated peptide synthesizer was used for the synthesis . Amino acid coupling reactions were per - formed with 2 molar equivalents of Fmoc - protected amino acid , 1 . 95 molar equiv - alents of HBTU , and 3 molar equivalents of DIEA for 3 h . The Fmoc protect - ing group removal was performed with a 20 % piperidine in dimethylformamide ( DMF ) solution for 20 min . In order to block free amine groups after amino acid coupling , 10 % acetic anhydride in DMF solution was used . The resin was washed by using DMF and dichloromethane ( DCM ) after each step . Cleavage of the peptides from the resin was carried out in 10 mL solution of triﬂuoroacetic acid ( TFA ) / triisopropylsilane ( TIS ) / ddH 2 O prepared with ratio of 95 / 2 . 5 / 2 . 5 , respec - tively for 2 h . Excess TFA was removed by rotary evaporation . The remaining peptide was triturated via overnight incubation at − 20 ◦ C in diethyl ether . Af - ter a centrifugation step , the precipitate was collected by drying the pellet and dissolving in double - distilled water . The peptide was frozen and incubated at − 80 ◦ C overnight . The frozen peptide was lyophilized for 3 days . 58 Figure 3 . 1 : Chemical representations of PA molecules Lauryl - VVAGEEE ( E 3 - PA ) and Lauryl - VVAGKKK - Am ( K 3 - PA ) , and their self - assembly into proposed E 3 / K 3 - PA nanoﬁber structure . 59 3 . 2 . 2 Characterizations of PA molecules and the peptide nanoﬁbers 3 . 2 . 2 . 1 Oscillatory rheology of the peptide gel Time sweep oscillatory rheology of 1 % ( w / v ) PA mixture was performed using a traditional rheometer ( Anton Paar ) . A total volume of 250 µ L was used from a mixture of 108 µ L E 3 - PA ( 11 mM ) and 144 µ L K 3 - PA ( 11 mM ) . A PP25 - SN17979 measuring device having a diameter of 25 mm was used . The measuring distance was determined as 0 . 5 mm . Measurements were performed with three repeats . Time sweep tests were carried out for 30 min with a measurement point duration of 0 . 5 min . Angular frequency and strain magnitude were kept constant as ω = 10 rad / s and γ = 0 . 1 % , respectively . Frequency sweep test was performed by sweeping logarithmically from ω = 1 rad / s - 1 to 1000 rad / s - 1 and by setting amplitude gamma ( γ ) constant as 0 . 1 % . Amplitude sweep ( strain sweep ) test was performed by ramping logarithmically from 0 . 01 % to 100 % strain and by keeping the frequency constant ω = 10 rad / s . 3 . 2 . 3 Force mapping and data analysis Procedure for cantilever spring constant calibration and sample preparation can be found in Appendix A . Force measurements were performed with the Teﬂon - like thin - ﬁlm ( ∼ 200 nm ) coated probes ( C 4 F 8 coating at 400 W for 5 or 10 min ) having a diameter of approximately 350 nm at the tip apex . An MFP - 3D model Asylum Research AFM was used to perform force mapping at contact - mode . Each sample was measured within 1 . 5 hours at room temperature in DMEM medium . Force maps were measured at a resolution of 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 within a 50 µ m x 50 µ m area . A trigger point of 0 . 5 V was applied at force mapping . Force distances were set at either 10 µ m or 5 µ m . Vertical deﬂection correction was performed before starting force map measurements . Cells were grown on bare glass coverslips ( 13 mm ) or on peptide - coated coverslips at a density of 4 x 60 10 4 cells per coverslip . Coverslips were glued onto glass slides using nail polish before AFM measurements in order to ﬁx the coverslip . Used AFM probes were cleaned either with double - distilled water , acetone and double - distilled water , respectively , or with only double - distilled water from a wash bottle . 3 . 2 . 3 . 1 AFM data analysis 12 random force curves were selected per cell . Each coverslip sample was mea - sured within 1 . 5 h to lessen the eﬀects of environmental conditions ( e . g . tem - perature , CO 2 , pH ) on the cells . Cells were analyzed at following counts : 45 , 58 and 44 at days 3 , 7 and 14 for rMSCs on bare glass ; 29 , 35 , 32 at days 3 , 7 and 14 ; for rMSCs on E 3 / K 3 peptide nanoﬁbers ; 65 , 90 and 42 at days 3 , 7 , 14 for rMSCs on gelatin , all counts were indicated here with respect to the days of osteogenic diﬀerentiation . Force curves were randomly selected from each cell area . The conical Hertz model was applied to calculate Young ' s moduli from ap - proach curves using the Igor Pro AFM analysis software [ 202 ] . Half - cone angle was assumed to be 36 ◦ , the Poisson ' s ratio of the cells was assumed to be 0 . 33 , and the tip radius was assumed to be 150 nm . 3 . 3 Results and discussion 3 . 3 . 1 Characterization of the PAs and peptide nanoﬁbers Cell lineage speciﬁc diﬀerentiation of MSCs can be controlled by culturing them on two - dimensional bioactive peptide amphiphile hydrogels . Two diﬀerent pep - tide amphiphile ( PA ) molecules were designed so that they would form nanoﬁ - brous peptide assemblies when mixed and the nanoﬁbers would also expose bioac - tive sequences that would induce osteogenic diﬀerentiation . 61 3 . 3 . 1 . 1 Characterization of individual PA molecules Peptides were characterized using LC - MS ( Agilent Technologies 65301200 Accurate - Mass Q - TOF ) analysis ( Fig . 3 . 2 - 3 . 5 ) . One milligram of the peptide sample was dissolved in double distilled water and sonicated for 15 min . Pep - tide samples that have purities lower than 95 % were puriﬁed using reverse - phase preparative high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . 3 . 3 . 1 . 2 Formation of self - assembled PA nanoﬁbers Stock solutions of PAs were prepared in double distilled water . For nanoﬁber formation , 0 . 75 mM solution of E 3 - PA was mixed with 1 mM solution of K 3 - PA at 1 : 1 ( v / v ) ratios , respectively , in order to stabilize all net charges . Tissue culture plate surfaces were coated with ﬁrst E 3 - PA ; then , K 3 - PA was added by pipetting or by gently mixing using tip of micropipette and then plates were placed in a laminar air ﬂow hood and dried overnight . After drying , they were sterilized under exposure to UV light for an hour before cell seeding for cell culture studies . In order to characterize the formation of nanoﬁbrous assemblies , SEM imaging was performed ( Fig . 3 . 4 ) . AFM imaging of peptide nanoﬁbers was studied both in air ( dried ) ( Fig . 3 . 5 ) and in aqueous environment ( in solution ) ( Fig . 3 . 6 ) . For both dried and in liquid AFM imaging measurements , same PA concentra - tion was used . To prepare the self - assembled PA nanoﬁber samples , E 3 - PA ( 0 . 75 mM ) was mixed with K 3 - PA ( 1 mM ) at 1 : 1 ( v / v ) ratios . For dried conditions , cleaned glass coverslips were used as substrates . For in liquid imaging , cleaved mica surface was used as the substratum and a silicon nitride probe was used for the contact mode imaging . At ﬁrst , nothing was observed on the mica surface , ∼ 1 h later , nanoﬁbrils started to appear with small lengths . Afterwards , AFM images were measured continuously from a selected area without stopping the scanning for an hour and images shown in Figure 3 . 6 were recorded . 62 Figure 3 . 2 : A ) RP - HPLC chromatogram of E 3 - PA , the change of response units with respect to time at 220 nm .

Rheology analysis of 1 % w / v concentration of E 3 / K 3 - PA showed that the re - sulting material had hydrogel character because its storage modulus ( G ' ) was higher than its loss modulus ( G ' ' ) ( Fig . 3 . 7 , Fig . B . 1A ) . Frequency sweep and amplitude ( strain ) sweep test results were also performed following time sweep test , for each sample of three replicates ( Fig . B . 1 , see Appendix B ) . Storage modulus of E 3 / K 3 - PA gel is independent of oscillation frequency ( Fig . B . 1B ) . In the ﬁrst two measurements of amplitude sweep test , E 3 / K 3 - PA gel remained in the linear viscoelastic range ( i . e . constant plateau of the storage modulus ) up to 1 % strain ( Fig . B . 1C ) . It was not the case with the third measurement , but because the ﬁrst two almost perfectly overlap , it might be reasonable to consider 65 Figure 3 . 5 : Tapping mode AFM images of E 3 / K 3 - PA dried on a cleaned glass coverslip . the ﬁrst two measurements as more reliable . 3 . 3 . 2 Commitment of rat mesenchymal stem cells ( rM - SCs ) to osteogenic diﬀerentiation on the peptide nanoﬁbers 3 . 3 . 2 . 1 Viability rMSCs on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers Viability of rMSCs was checked using live / dead assay after 24 h of incubation ( Fig . 3 . 8 ) . These results showed that peptide nanoﬁbers provide a biocompatible environment and were not toxic to cells . 66 Figure 3 . 6 : Contact - mode AFM images of self - assembly process of E 3 / K 3 - PA nanoﬁbers formed on mica surface in solution . Each image was measured at approximately 10 min . 67 Figure 3 . 7 : Time sweep rheology analysis of E 3 / K 3 - PA . 1 % w / v concentration of individual PAs were mixed on the sample holder of rheometer and the measure - ment was performed immediately after the mixing . Results are given with three repeats . Error bars are mean ± SEM . 3 . 3 . 3 Force mapping reveals stiﬀening of rMSCs diﬀeren - tiating on the osteoinductive self - assembled peptide nanoﬁbers Mechanical properties of rMSCs that formed cell clusters on E 3 / K 3 - PA nanoﬁbers were investigated using force - distance curve - based AFM ( Fig . 3 . 9 ) . Force map - ping measurements were performed on rMSC cell clusters on peptide nanoﬁbers and rMSCs on bare glass . The Teﬂon - like C 4 F 8 thin ﬁlm - coated antifouling AFM probes were used for the force mapping measurements ( Fig . 2 . 1 ) . Young ' s modulus values were calculated by ﬁtting approach curves with coni - cal Hertz model . 12 force curves per cell were used in data analysis and presented 68 Figure 3 . 8 : Live / dead assay of rMSCs on E 3 / K 3 - PA nanoﬁber gel . Green is calcein - AM that shows live cells . Red color is ethidium homodimer ( which is not seen here because there are not any dead cells ) that indicates dead cells . Quantitative result of cell survival obtained from cell counts was shown on the graph on the right . Samples were analyzed with three repeats . in histograms ( Fig . 3 . 10 and 3 . 11 ) . Results indicated that rMSCs signiﬁcantly in - creased their average Young ' s moduli on peptide nanoﬁbers in osteogenic medium between day 3 and day 7 , from an average value of 1 . 43 ± 0 . 16 kPa at day 3 to 2 . 19 ± 0 . 19 kPa at day 7 . In addition , Young ' s moduli of rMSCs remained high on peptide nanoﬁbers on day 14 ( 2 . 30 ± 0 . 25 kPa ) . In contrast , the elasticity of rMSCs on glass decreased signiﬁcantly from day 3 to day 7 ( Fig . 3 . 10 and 3 . 11 ) . On day 3 , rMSCs on glass had an average Young ' s modulus value of 2 . 60 ± 0 . 17 kPa , while this value dropped sharply on day 7 ( to 0 . 74 ± 0 . 09 kPa ) and further on day 14 ( to 0 . 67 ± 0 . 04 kPa ) . Peptide - coated coverslips were also measured by AFM to obtain Young ' s mod - ulus changes that happen to the peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel due to incubation in the osteogenic medium ( Fig . 3 . 12 ) . As a result , the elastic modulus of peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel was found in a range suitable for osteogenic diﬀerentiation , 69 Figure 3 . 9 : A ) Optical microscope images of rMSCs on glass , E 3 / K 3 - PA and gelatin , all in osteogenic diﬀerentiation medium . Scale bars are 100 µ m . B ) Representative force maps of rMSCs on glass surface and aggregates of rMSCs on the peptide nanoﬁbers . Force curves shown on the right of the maps belong to a random point on a map on its lane . The force maps were measured from cells on day 3 ( for bare glass ) or day 7 ( for E 3 / K 3 - PA ) of osteogenic diﬀerentiation . 70 Figure 3 . 10 : Young ' s modulus histograms of rMSCs on days 3 , 7 and 14 of osteogenic diﬀerentiation on E 3 / K 3 - coated glass , bare glass and gelatin - coated glass . * * * * p < 0 . 0001 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * p < 0 . 05 . n indicates the number of cells analyzed . Error bars are standard errors of mean . Each dot corresponds to a force - distance measurement . 12 force curves per cell were selected from force maps and stacked for each substrate / matrix groups . that is , between 20 and 100 kPa , as Discher group suggested [ 29 ] . Elastic mod - ulus values of the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel on day 7 and 14 are at the optimum , which might be a reason for the remarkable increase in biomin - eralization after day 3 . This result also rules out the possibility that the increase observed in cellular elastic moduli between day 3 and day 7 might be due ma - trix / substrate eﬀects , which is not the case because the matrix Young ' s modulus values of the peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel are higher on day 3 than day 7 . Close and intensive cell - cell contacts were observed at the osteogenic diﬀerenti - ating cells on the peptide nanoﬁbers . This observation agrees with a report in the 71 Figure 3 . 11 : Nanomechanical characterization results graphed as frequency dis - tribution histograms with Gaussian curves . 72 Figure 3 . 12 : Young ' s moduli derived from AFM force mapping of E 3 / K 3 only control samples ( peptide - coated glass coverslips without cells ) incubated in os - teogenic medium . n is the number of force maps measured and analyzed from the samples . 73 literature that osteoblasts have close contacts with each other [ 26 ] . Mature os - teoblasts operate as bone lining cells which were shown in close contact with each other in related studies in the literature [ 169 , 203 ] . In contrast to osteoblasts , osteocytes were shown to be regulated with intercellular separation [ 26 ] . More - over , condensation of mesenchymal stromal cells was previously reported to be correlated with osteogenic diﬀerentiation in the literature [ 204 ] , suggesting an indication of osteogenic diﬀerentiation of rMSCs on E 3 - PA / E 3 - PA nanoﬁbers . 3 . 3 . 4 Mineralization proﬁle of the diﬀerentiating cells on the peptide nanoﬁbers Alizarin red staining was performed to analyze calcium deposition by the cells on the peptide nanoﬁbers ( Fig . 3 . 13 ) . Mineralization correlates well with cell stiﬀness increase on the peptide nanoﬁbers ( Fig . 3 . 10 and 3 . 11 ) . Hence it can be argued that osteoblast maturation on the bioactive peptide nanoﬁbers causes cell stiﬀening due to extensive mineral deposition during osteogenic diﬀerentia - tion of rMSCs . For the mineral deposition , it can be speculated that a mineral nucleation occurs on the peptide nanoﬁbers because of the cell - material interac - tion ( i . e . cell - peptide interaction ) since calcium deposition occurs extensively at the diﬀerentiated cells ( i . e . osteogenic cells , osteoblasts ) and calcium crystals are extracellularly deposited and also that negatively charged triple glutamic acid sequence that is found on E 3 - PA might attract positively charged calcium . An - other speculation , this regarding to cell stiﬀening , can be done for the osteogenic diﬀerentiating cells in vivo that there must be such a cell stiﬀening due to miner - alization of mature osteoblasts after diﬀerentiating from MSCs because peptide nanoﬁbers might mimic the natural ECM better than other Young ' s modulus characterization studies of adherent MSCs diﬀerentiating on ﬂat substrates and the measurements performed with AFM . 74 Figure 3 . 13 : Calcium deposition proﬁles of cells on the bioactive peptide nanoﬁbers and on the TCP . A ) Optical microscope images with Alizarin red staining . Scale bars are 100 µ m . B ) Quantiﬁcation of Ca 2 + deposition on peptide nanoﬁbers and TCP on days 7 and day 14 . 3 . 4 Conclusion and future perspectives rMSCs eﬃciently diﬀerentiated into osteogenic lineage on the osteoinductive pep - tide nanoﬁbers . They formed osteogenic cell clusters , also called bone nodules , which deposited remarkable amounts of calcium . Their Young ' s moduli had an increasing pattern which might have resulted from the calcium mineralization on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers . In contrast , rMSCs on the gelatin - coated glass showed a decreasing pattern of Young ' s modulus which could be explained by lack of suﬃcient mineralization proﬁle of the cells . Young ' s modulus of osteogenic diﬀerentiating cells at the adherent state might increase with mineral deposition by the cells . Also importantly , the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers that I utilized are smart biomaterials that can be used for tuning the rate of biomineralization and hence the osteoblast diﬀerentiation , thus they are promising to be utilized for bone tissue engineering applications . 75 Chapter 4 Force Mapping the Osteospheroids with Colloidal Microbead AFM Probes 4 . 1 Study background and hypothesis To investigate if the tip choice has any eﬀect on the results of mechanical mea - surements performed on the cells , I also performed force mapping experiments by using commercial colloidal microspherical bead attached AFM cantilevers . I expected a similar increasing trend of Young ' s moduli of osteospheroids on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers in the results . 4 . 2 Materials and methods Cell culture experimental method is the same as in Chapter 3 except in the followings that days of diﬀerentiation were diﬀerent , that I did not include gelatin group , and that cell density was chosen as 5 , 000 cells / well of 24 - well plate during 76 cell seeding step , diﬀerently . Same peptide amphiphiles E 3 / K 3 - PA were used . Gold microsphere sQube ® probes having a diameter of 5 . 2 µ m were used for AFM force mapping measurements ( Figure 4 . 1 ) and Young ' s modulus of rMSCs diﬀerentiated on nanoﬁbers in osteogenic medium was obtained by applying JKR model at Igor Pro , software of AFM . Young ' s modulus of rMSCs grown on bare glass in the normal growth medium was calculated by applying Hertz model to approach curve of the force distance curves . rMSCs on glass were grown only in normal growth medium . However , rMSCs on peptide nanoﬁbers were transferred to osteogenic medium 4 days after inital seeding and after reaching to some degree of conﬂuency . Figure 4 . 1 : Scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) images of gold colloidal micro - sphere AFM probes ( sQube ® ) before ( left ) and after ( right ) use in AFM force mapping measurements . 4 . 3 Results and discussion Viability of the cells cultured on peptide nanoﬁbers was tested . Experiment result is shown with 24 h , 48 h and 72 h results , which showed that the cells were viable ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . Cells on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers were allowed to diﬀerentiate until day 24 of osteogenic diﬀerentiation as shown via inverted optical microscope images ( Figure 4 . 3 ) and AFM measurements were performed on the 77 cells at the indicated days of osteogenic diﬀerentiation . Day of transfer from cell maintenance medium to osteogenic diﬀerentiation induction medium was marked as Day 0 because it was the start of osteogenic diﬀerentiation . Representative 16 x 16 force maps are shown in Figure 4 . 4 . Histograms with scatter plots were graphed for both rMSCs on E 3 / K 3 - PA ( Figure 4 . 5 ) and rMSCs on bare glass ( Figure 4 . 6 ) . Cells on bare glass are on a stable Young ' s moduli trend while there is a somewhat increasing pattern of Young ' s moduli of cells on E 3 / K 3 - PA , correlating with the nanomechanical measurement results ( Figure 3 . 10 and A . 1 ) . Although the sample numbers are low in the microindentation experiments , these results still show that Young ' s modulus values of cells are not very far from the nanomechanical characterization results presented in the previous chapter of this thesis work . In the literature , studies comparing elastic modulus values of cells measured with sharp and microsphere probe , like that of Sokolov group ' s , found great variances between elastic modulus values of cell between nano and microindentation AFM experiments as the sharp probe yielded much greater numbers ( mostly around 10 , 15 and 20 kPa ) of elastic moduli whereas microsphere probe ( having a diameter of ∼ 5 µ m ) yielded around 1 , 2 and 3 kPa on human cervical epithelial cells [ 130 ] . Nanomechanical characterization results performed by Teﬂon - like AFM probes do not correlate with that study for example . Sharp probes usually result with higher error margins when compared to microindentation based results [ 205 ] . One reason that I get similar elastic modulus values from my experiments of both nano - and micromechanical characterizations might be that the Teﬂon - like probes are promising for obtaining more precise force curve measurements than that conventional sharp probes can provide and since the curve ﬁttings were quite not bad based on the Hertz Cone model as shown with representative curve ﬁttings in Figure 3 . 9 , AFM’s software must have given realistic elastic modulus values . 78 Figure 4 . 2 : Live / dead assay repeat experiment result of rMSCs cultured on E 3 / K 3 - PA nanoﬁbers . Representative ﬂuorescence microscope images are shown . Quantitative result was calculated from three repeats samples . 72 h result of TCP was excluded due to overconﬂuency . 79 Figure 4 . 3 : Optical microscope images of rMSCs on osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁber - coated glass coverslip in osteogenic medium ( on the left ) versus rM - SCs on bare glass coverslip ( on the right ) in maintenance medium are shown . 80 Figure 4 . 4 : Representative force map results of rMSCs cultured on bare glass and rMSC on E 3 / K 3 - PA - coated glass . Height maps and converted Young ' s modulus maps are shown . 4 . 4 Conclusion and future perspectives rMSCs eﬃciently diﬀerentiated into osteogenic lineage on the osteoinductive pep - tide nanoﬁbers . They formed osteogenic cell clusters . Micromechanical measure - ments on the cells using the colloidal probe showed that Young ' s modulus of diﬀerentiating rMSCs had an increasing pattern on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers while rMSCs on the bare glass coverslips did not show such pattern but showed a stationary trend of average Young ' s modulus changes in normal growth medium because the cells were expected not to diﬀerentiate . 81 Teﬂon - like spheroconical probes are promising for elastic modulus characteri - zation of living cells as they gave results similar to microindentation experiment results at range , and if a suitable contact mechanics model can be derived , which can surpass the Sneddon model , that better describes the probe geometry and the indentation , and is better at estimating the elastic modulus values of cells , more reliable and repeatable results can be obtained from cell mechanics experiments when Teﬂon - like spheroconical probes are utilized . 82 Figure 4 . 5 : AFM Young ' s modulus results of diﬀerentiating rMSCs cultured on E 3 / K 3 - PA peptide nanoﬁbers shown via columns with scatter plot . Each dot represents an analysis of a single force - distance curve measurement . n is the number of cells analyzed at indicated day of diﬀerentiation . Young ' s modulus of rMSCs diﬀerentiated on nanoﬁbers in osteogenic medium was obtained by applying JKR model at Igor Pro , software of AFM . Normal growth medium of rMSCs on peptide nanoﬁbers were replaced with osteogenic medium at 4th day after initial seeding in order to reach suﬃcient conﬂuency . 83 Figure 4 . 6 : AFM Young ' s modulus results of diﬀerentiating rMSCs cultured on bare glass coverslip . Each dot represents an analysis of a single force - distance curve measurement . n is the number of cells analyzed at indicated day of dif - ferentiation . Young ' s moduli of rMSCs in the normal growth medium on glass coverslip were calculated by applying Hertz model to approach curve of the force distance curves . rMSCs on glass were grown only in normal growth medium . 84 Chapter 5 Conclusions and Future Perspectives 5 . 1 General conclusions Bioactive peptide nanoﬁber hydrogels can be used as osteoinductive scaﬀolds to induce osteogenic diﬀerentiation of rMSCs in which the cells form cell clusters on the nanoﬁbers during diﬀerentiation in osteogenic medium . The average Young ' s modulus value of cells increases on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers while the values are lower when compared to the bare glass and gelatin groups . The same trend is not present for the rMSCs on the bare glass group because there is no signiﬁcant increase of average Young ' s modulus value of the cells between days 3 and 7 on the glass . It can be speculated that cell stiﬀening that happens on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers might imply that MSCs must be undergoing a stiﬀening process throughout their diﬀerentiation into mature osteoblasts in vivo and that mineralization in vivo might cause the osteogenic diﬀerentiating MSCs to stiﬀen eﬀectively . Furthermore , the peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel utilized here had Young ' s modulus values between 20 - 100 kPa range when incubated at the same conditions as the cells cultured on scaﬀolds . This might suggest that MSCs increase their Young ' s moduli in an ECM - like environment . Since there 85 was not signiﬁcant mineralization by rMSCs on the gelatin , it is reasonable to conclude that the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers might have increased the rate of osteogenic diﬀerentiation of rMSCs because the mineralization happened quickly on the peptide nanoﬁbers . 5 . 2 Future perspectives As a future perspective , the osteospheroids can be used for therapeutic purposes , as they are readily formed on the osteoinductive peptide nanoﬁbers during os - teogenic diﬀerentiation . The osteospheroids can be collected and administered to local areas of injury for enhancing bone regeneration and biomineralization . For future studies , longer periods of diﬀerentiation ( e . g . until day 28 ) can be studied with mechanical measurements with increased number of repeats so that n can be increased and results of later stages of diﬀerentiation can be achieved . Hence , not only osteoblast diﬀerentiation from MSCs but also osteocyte diﬀeren - tiation might be possible for evaluation of cellular elasticity and identiﬁcation of related biophysical markers . I tried to do it with microsphere probe already but my cell number which can be analyzed is relatively low at most of the days . In this thesis work , nuclear and cytoskeletal mechanics were not analyzed separately . AFM analyses might be feasable to decouple nuclear and cytoskeletal contributions to cellular mechanical responses because state - of - the - art AFMs can be capable of measuring images at higher speeds and resolutions for mechanical analysis . Modifying AFM tips with Teﬂon - like coating allowed obtaining elastic mod - ulus values of cells reliably and similar to the values of elastic modulus of cells derived upon force mapping with microsphere probe , which suggests that Teﬂon - like probes are better than conventional sharp AFM tips whose force curve mea - surements on cells might typically result elastic modulus values 10 times larger than that of microsphere probe used measurements . 86 5 . 3 Challenges encountered during AFM mea - surements for mechanical characterization of spheroids on the peptide nanoﬁber hy - drogels One of the challenges associated with AFM experiments of spherical cell aggre - gates on the peptide nanoﬁbers is the limited Z range of AFM , which is typically 10 µ m or 20 µ m at most commercial AFMs . If aggregates constisting of few cells are measured on the peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel , then there is the issue of topogra - phy of the hydrogel . In my experiments , the Z range of Asylum Research MFP - 3D AFM is ∼ 10 µ m , sometimes even the hydrogel topography was too variant and rough that not only I had diﬃculties of completing force mapping measurements , but also distinguishing cells from the hydrogel became by itself diﬃcult when I wanted to measure force maps of aggregates having small heights . Measurement of the spheroids with very large heights , say spheroids having more than 100 cells , became possible only when AFM probe was manually positioned on top of the spheroid when engaging . Also , keeping the force distance at 10 µ m allowed acquiring more force curves which can result with good ﬁtting and contain the horizontal part , which were another issue for doing a reliable data analysis . Especially with the gold microsphere probes , the adhesion between cells and the tip was very high and sometimes a spheroid attached to the tip and stayed attached , preventing the continuation of the measurements with the same probe . Teﬂon - like probes did not cause such problems . 87 Bibliography [ 1 ] F . Barry and M .

Low glucose Dulbecco ' s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) with 10 % FBS , 1 % L - glutamate and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin . After they have been mixed together under laminal ﬂow inside the biological safety cabinet , they have been passed through 0 . 2 µ m ﬁlter . 2 . AFM probes 3 . Fingernail polish 4 . Micropipettes and micropipette tips 5 . Microscope slides and glass coverslips 6 . Tissue culture plates ( TCP ) ( e . g . preferably 4 - well plate or 12 - well plate ) 112 7 . A tweezer 8 . Forceps or needles to remove the coverslip from the well plate . Tweezer might also work here . 9 . Petri dishes 10 . Glass slides and glass coverslips ( preferably 13 mm ) A . 2 Methods A . 2 . 1 Calibration of the AFM probe AFM probe is mounted to cantilever holder using an appropriate tweezer . AFM ' s computer , illumination light and laser light of AFM are switched on . Calibration of spring constant of AFM includes two steps : calibrating the deﬂection inverse optical lever sensitivity ( InvOLS ) and ﬁtting a Lorentzian resonant frequency peak ( usually the ﬁrst Brownian mode ) of the cantilever from the thermal noise data to determine the spring constant of the AFM cantilever experimentally . Both steps should be performed in liquid environment . A . 2 . 1 . 1 Calibration of deﬂection InvOLS Put water on glass , preferably put ∼ 300 µ l double distilled water via micropipette on a clean 13 - mm glass coverslip previously glued on a glass slide . Lower the AFM head and be careful to not crash onto the surface , it may damage the tip . When the Z - Voltage drops down dramatically , it means that the AFM tip has touched the surface of the sample . There may be sound alarm incorporated into the AFM system which is activated as the Z voltage decreases below 150 V . After the tip is in contact with the surface , you may keep the Z - Voltage at about 90 - 120 V . After engaging the tip on the surface at contact mode , perform a single force curve measurement at contact mode . If needed , a vertical deﬂection correction can be done in order to make the horizontal part of the force curve parallel to 113 the x - axis . Then measure again another single force curve and you will see that new measurement will come with horizontal part of the force curves parallel to the x - axis . Fit the slope of the force curve with deﬂection or deﬂection volts by placing the cursors , this time to the sloppy part of the force curve . Fit the slope by selecting DeﬂVolts or Deﬂection . Then the deﬂection inverse optical lever sensitivity calibration will have been accomplished . Then , click withdraw and upper the head to make sure you are not in contact with the surface anymore . Proceed with the thermal noise data capture . A . 2 . 1 . 2 Thermal noise data capture followed by peak ﬁtting Measure thermal noise data when above enough the surface , which allows record - ing the Brownian motion of the cantilever . Thermal noise spectra for Teﬂon - like coated SiNi probes measured in air and water are shown in Figure A . 1 . The thermal noise spectrum in water is shifted to the left because of the diﬀerence of the refractive index between air and water . In cell culture medium , the thermal noise spectrum is not too diﬀerent from that of measured in water . First peak is the highest peak , which is ideal for selection to ﬁt because it is the resonant frequency of ﬁrst Brownian mode which it describes the motion of the cantilever that deﬂection having a spring constant value nearest with nominal value . When one of lower peaks are selected , the cantilever is driven at the higher order modes , ending up with greater spring constant values . For selecting a peak , put cursors that are right below the graph , and position them at the starting and ending point of the peak and do the ﬁtting of the peak , and the spring constant will have been determined by doing so . After that , then remove the head from its position on the AFM stage . Dry the cantilever holder and remove the slide from the platform . 114 Figure A . 1 : Thermal noise versus frequency spectrum of Teﬂon - like coated silicon nitride AFM probes in air A ) and in cell culture medium B ) . 115 A . 2 . 2 Sample preparation Cells are cultivated on 13 mm glass coverslips or peptide nanoﬁber hydrogel - coated glass coverslips inside well plates in the cell culture . At AFM experimen - tation time , ﬁrst an AFM probe is mounted to the cantilever holder and calibrated in the water on a glass coverslip glued on a glass slide previously . About 300 µ l of water is suﬃcient for covering Asylum Research MFP 3D model AFM ' s cantilever holder and letting a water column to form . After calibration , the cells are brought nearby to the AFM . One coverslip with cells at a time was nail polished on a glass slide to make it immobile during the measurements . For doing that , an arbitrar - ily suﬃcient nail polish is dropped on the center of a glass slide , that should not be allowed to leak above the glass coverslips with the cells , that are supposed to be removed using tweezers or with the help of a needle from dish / well - plate , and then carefully placed onto the droplet of nail polish . The sample can be pressed a little by contacting to near - edge areas of the coverslip using tweezers for the nail polish to spread more . About 50 µ l of cell culture medium is gently added onto the cells using a micropipette . Wait 5 - 10 min for nail polish to dry so that it holds the glass coverslip immobile the AFM measurements can then safely be performed . Before putting the slide onto the AFM platform , ensure to protect the AFM ' s optics and electronics against liquid falling . For doing this , we put stretch ﬁlm ﬁrst and then place the substrate and the sample on it . Add more medium onto the cells at the AFM stage as the glass slide having sample nail polished on it is placed on the stage , as shown in Figure A . 2 . Magnets , in case for the presence of magnetic AFM stage , are placed upside down to both corners of the glass slide for moving it easily during measurements . A . 2 . 3 Measuring force curves on live cells Apply a force distance of 5 µ m or more for force mapping measurements . A trig - ger point of 0 . 5 V and a scan rate of 0 . 5 Hz ( piezo speed would be 0 . 5 µ m / s for 0 . 5 Hz scan rate and 5 µ m force distance ) would be enough . When the AFM tip is in interaction with the sample surface , move the slide in the x and y directions to 116 Figure A . 2 : Appearances of the sample on the AFM stage to make it ready for the measurements . A ) Droplet of cell culture medium dropped on the sample , cells grown on coverslip , nail polished on a glass slide . Magnets are placed upside down for moving the sample easily in the x - y directions . B ) Water column forms between the cantilever holder of AFM and the sample . bring the AFM probe right above the cells on slide . Measure free force curves on the cells and correct the vertical deﬂection if needed ( i . e . horizontal parts of the force curve are not parallel to the x - axis . Then you may proceed with the mea - surements . During the measurement process , check force curves being measured by AFM . In an encounter of unexpected dissonances , you may need to stop and re - adjust the z - axis , for instance , I had to do this frequently when I measured the samples that contained spherical cell aggregates ( i . e . large spheroids ) formed on the peptide nanoﬁber gel . Single session must be kept under one and a half hour because in room conditions cells start dying after this amount of time unless a carbon dioxide supply and a heater stage is used . Depending on the type of AFM tip used , diﬀerent types of models may be used for analysis . Hertz or Sneddon model from the software of AFM can be used with the parameters of a half - cone angle of 36 ◦ and a Poisson ratio of 0 . 5 . However , diﬀerent type of tips and sample - tip interactions may require the implementation of other types of models . From the force maps , it is often straightforward to visualize a microscale object like cells , and the derivation of the elastic modulus of the sample along with magnitude of adhesive forces observed at the retraction curves . To count strong adhesion at force curves in the calculation of elastic modulus , JKR model may be preferred . 117 Appendix B Supplementary information 118 Figure B . 1 : A ) Time sweep , B ) frequency sweep and C ) amplitude sweep tests of 1 wt % E 3 / K 3 - PA gel , three replicates are explicitly shown . 119
