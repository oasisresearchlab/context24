Formation of protrusions is mediated by coordinated actions between the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton . Here , we found that the single calponin homology ( CH ) domain - containing protein CHDP - 1 induces the formation of cell protrusions in C . elegans . CHDP - 1 is anchored to the cortex through its amphipathic helix . CHDP - 1 associates through its CH domain with the small GTPase Rac1 / CED - 10 , which is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton . CHDP - 1 preferentially binds to the GTP - bound active form of the CED - 10 protein and preserves the membrane localization of GTP - CED - 10 . Hence , by coupling membrane expansion to Rac1 - mediated actin dynamics , CHDP - 1 promotes the formation of cellular protrusions in vivo . Author Summary In response to intra - and extracellular cues , remodeling of the sub - membranous cortical actin cytoskeleton constantly reorganizes the plasma membrane . Thus , distinct types of actin - rich invaginations or protrusions , such as filopodia and lamellipodia , enable cells to explore territory and pull themselves around . Extensive research has shown that the plasma membrane is tightly coupled to the motility machinery . However , how the contin - uous reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is coupled with appropriate restructuring of the plasma membrane at the molecular level in vivo is unclear . Here , we identified that the single calponin homology ( CH ) domain - containing protein CHDP - 1 promotes the forma - tion of cell protrusions in C . elegans . CHDP - 1 localizes to the cell cortex and through its calponin homology ( CH ) domain , CHDP - 1 directly binds to the master actin regulator Rac1 / CED - 10 and enhances the membrane localization of the active CED - 10 protein . Thus , we discovered a novel CHDP - 1 / Rac1 module which effectively couples membrane expansion to cortex actin dynamics in vivo .

Introduction In eukaryotic cells , the actin cytoskeleton forms a cortical shell around the cell periphery , which allows the plasma membrane to undergo frequent structural changes . The Rho family of small GTPases generally act on membranes and affect the movement of these membranes by changing the membrane - associated actin cytoskeleton . Rac1 and Cdc42 induce plasma mem - brane protrusions , including lamellipodia and filopodia , while RhoA activation specifically stimulates the formation of actin stress fibers [ 1 ] . Through the multi - protein WAVE complex , Rac1 indirectly stimulates the formation of new actin filaments [ 2 , 3 ] . Alternatively , Rac1 and CDC42 target PAK family members , which in turn phosphorylate LIMKs ( LIM domain kinases ) , and ultimately act on the actin - severing factor cofilin [ 4 – 6 ] . RhoA often acts as an antagonist of Rac1 and Cdc42 , and inhibition of either RhoA or its effector ROCK can result in Rac1 activation [ 7 – 9 ] . The activity of Rho GTPases is strictly controlled by various regulatory proteins , including guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , which convert the inactive GDP - bound enzymes into active GTP - bound forms , and GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) , which stimulate GTP hydrolysis , thereby converting the active GTPases into their inactive forms . Cell motility , which involves a continuous reorganization of the cytoskeleton , must be accompanied by appropriate restructuring of the plasma membrane . Indeed , extensive research has identified a diverse array of actin regulatory proteins that are directly associated with the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane , including vinculin [ 10 , 11 ] , talin [ 12 , 13 ] , α - actinin [ 10 , 14 ] and cofilin [ 15 ] . The plasma membrane is rich in anionic phospholipids , which form electrostatic interactions with cytosolic proteins . Among the structural domains that bind the membrane without specificity for particular phospholipids , the amphipathic helix and Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domains have membrane deformation activity [ 16 , 17 ] . The amphipathic helix domain deforms the membrane by inserting an amphipathic helix or a hydrophobic loop into the inner layer of the plasma membrane and forming addi - tional electrostatic interactions with anionic phospholipids in the cytosolic layer [ 18 ] . Pro - teins in the BAR domain superfamily use their positively charged , curved surface to induce membrane deformation with different degrees of curvature [ 16 ] . In particular , the I - BARs ( Inverse BAR domains ) can deform membranes in vitro into protrusion - like shapes [ 19 , 20 ] . However , it is still uncertain whether such membrane deformations actually take place in vivo . Calponin homology ( CH ) domains have been identified in proteins with a variety of func - tions ranging from actin binding to signaling [ 21 , 22 ] . The type I and type II CH domains together form the actin - binding region of a large number of F - actin - interacting proteins [ 23 , 24 ] . In contrast , calponin contains a single type III CH domain , which differs markedly from the type I and type II modules . The CH domain in calponin has been implicated in the association of multiple cytoskeleton - related components , but the actin - binding ability of type III CH domains in isolation is questionable [ 25 ] . Here , we discovered that the protein CHDP - 1 , which contains a single type III CH domain and shares homology to calponin in mammals , plays a crucial role in protrusion formation in C . elegans . With its additional amphipathic helix motif , CHDP - 1 localizes to the cell cortex and induces the formation of membrane protrusions . Furthermore , CHDP - 1 binds to the GTP - bound active form of the Rac1 homolog CED - 10 and facilitates the membrane association of the CED - 10 protein . Our work reveals a novel regula - tory component which couples membrane expansion to actin dynamics during protrusion for - mation in vivo . CHDP - 1 Couples Actin Dynamics to the Plasma Membrane PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006163 July 14 , 2016 2 / 20 Results Cell protrusion defects in xd27 animals BDU neurons are a pair of interneurons with cell bodies situated laterally in the anterior body of C . elegans . From its cell body , each BDU neuron projects an anterior process and a posterior process . The PLM neuron has its cell body located in the tail region and sends out an anterior process to the mid - body region of the animal . Our previous work demonstrated that the poste - rior process of BDU connects with the anterior process of PLM through gap junctions [ 26 ] ( Fig 1A and 1B ) . During the formation of the BDU - PLM connection , both the BDU and PLM neu - rons produce extensively elaborated membrane protrusions to reach each other and finally form the neuronal connection . From a genetic screen to search for mutants which display a BDU - PLM disconnection phenotype , we identified xd27 ( Fig 1C ) . In xd27 animals , the cell protrusions on both BDU and PLM cells are greatly reduced ( Fig 1D and 1E ) . Although a single neurite can project out from the posterior BDU or anterior PLM cell bodies in xd27 , the typical growth - cone - like membrane expansion is missing ( Fig 1E ) . Actin filament dynamics are essen - tial for cell surface protrusion but are not necessary for axonal elongation , which is thought to be mainly mediated by microtubule extension [ 27 ] . Intriguingly , the neurites from both BDU and PLM in xd27 can continuously extend ( Fig 1F and 1G ) . In xd27 adults , the BDU neurite length is almost indistinguishable from wild type , while the PLM neurite is slightly shorter than wild type ( Fig 1H ) . However , when we followed neurite growth during larval stages , we found that the PLM neurite elongates at a similar speed in both xd27 and wild - type animals ( Fig 1I ) , suggesting that the formation of actin - mediated cell protrusions may be specifically affected by the xd27 mutation . In addition to BDU and PLM cells , the head neurons RMED and RMEV , and the D type motor neurons DDs and / or VDs , also display weak neurite exten - sion defects ( S1 Fig ) . However , the locomotion of xd27 is generally normal . Besides the neural deficits , xd27 animals display partial embryonic lethality and weak egg laying and distal tip cell migration defects ( S1 Fig ) . chdp - 1 is required cell - autonomously for cell protrusion formation Through genetic mapping and genomic DNA sequencing , we identified C10G11 . 7 ( Fig 2A ) . C10G11 . 7 encodes a single type III CH domain - containing protein , which we named CHDP - 1 ( Fig 2A ) . It shares sequence similarity with calponin in mammals ( S1F Fig ) . In addition to the CH domain , CHDP - 1 contains two proline - rich motifs ( P1 and P2 ) in the N - terminal region and one amphipathic helix motif ( Helix ) close to the C - terminus ( Fig 2A ) . Proline - rich motifs widely participate in protein - protein interactions [ 28 ] , while amphipathic helix motifs directly interact with membrane phospholipids [ 29 ] . A phenylalanine to leucine change at position 117 was identified in xd27 worms ( Fig 2A ) . Another chdp - 1 allele , tm4947 , which removes the amphipathic helix domain and the majority of the CH domain ( Fig 2A ) and is likely a molecu - lar null , displays a similar membrane protrusion defect to xd27 ( Fig 2B and 2C ) , suggesting that xd27 may also act as a strong loss - of - function or null mutation . Introducing a wild - type copy of the chdp - 1 gene into xd27 or tm4947 animals restores the proper morphology of devel - oping BDU and PLM cells ( Fig 2B and 2C ) . Thus , mutations of the chdp - 1 gene are indeed responsible for the BDU - PLM connection defect . The chdp - 1 gene is widely expressed in almost every cell during the early embryonic stage ( Fig 2D ) . From late embryonic to adult stages , however , chdp - 1 expression was gradually restricted to certain sets of neurons including BDU , ALM , AVM , PLM , PVM and PVQ ( Fig 2E ) . When chdp - 1 cDNA was expressed in BDU or PLM alone , or BDU and PLM together , the BDU - PLM connection defect in chdp - 1 mutants was efficiently rescued ( Fig 2F ) .

A functional translational CHDP - 1 fusion green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) construct was introduced into worms . During the embryonic stage or after hatching , CHDP - 1 is distributed specifically at the cell periphery ( Fig 3A ) . After hatching , although some of the GFP : : CHDP - 1 becomes diffuse in the cytoplasm , most of the signal retains this membrane - like distribution ( Fig 3B ) . Within the PLM neuron , CHDP - 1 highlights the cell periphery ( Fig 3C ) , including surface protrusions ( Fig 3D ) . Further co - labeling experi - ments indicated that CHDP - 1 co - localizes well with the plasma membrane marker Myr - mCherry ( Fig 3C and 3D ) , suggesting that the CHDP - 1 protein associates with the cell cortex . The amphipathic helix motif has been implicated in membrane bilayer association [ 29 ] . We wondered whether the amphipathic helix motif hooks the CHDP - 1 protein onto the plasma Fig 2 . chdp - 1 functions cell - autonomously .

To test this hypothesis , we removed the amphipathic helix motif from CHDP - 1 and examined the subcellular localization of the residual CHDP - 1 fragment . We found that in the absence of the amphipathic helix motif , the cortex localization of CHDP - 1 is completely lost ( Fig 3E ) . In contrast , whenever the amphipathic helix motif is present , the peripheral dis - tribution of CHDP - 1 protein is largely preserved ( Fig 3E ) . Thus , the cortex localization prop - erty of CHDP - 1 is probably mediated by the amphipathic helix motif . Next , we asked whether the cortex localization is important for CHDP - 1 function . To address this question , we removed the amphipathic helix domain and performed rescue experi - ments . We found that deletion of the amphipathic helix domain largely abolished the rescue effect of CHDP - 1 ( Fig 3F ) . Therefore , localization to the cell cortex is crucial for CHDP - 1 function .

Furthermore , the amphipathic helix domain has been implicated in membrane deformation [ 16 ] . We therefore asked whether CHDP - 1 can promote membrane protrusion . To test this possibility , we increased chdp - 1 gene expression in PLM neurons using the P mec - 7 promoter . In wild - type animals , PLM cell bodies generally display smooth spindle - like shapes ( Fig 4A ) . When chdp - 1 gene expression was boosted , additional membrane protrusions of various sizes appeared on the surface of PLM cell bodies ( Fig 4B – 4D ) . The P mec - 7 promoter also drives chdp - 1 expression in ALM , AVM , and PVM neurons , and we found that these cells also display ectopic membrane protrusions around the cell body region ( S2 Fig ) . CHDP - 1 localizes to the cell cortex .

This suggests that CHDP - 1 may function at the cell margin to induce cell protrusion . The formation of cell surface protrusions is a cooperative result of both membrane expan - sion and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement . The expanded plasma membrane must be stabi - lized by the underlying cortical actin network . To address whether the ectopic membrane protrusions are genuine cell surface protrusions , we co - labeled PLM cells with Myr - GFP and mCherry - actin . We found that most of the ectopically expanded plasma membrane is indeed supported by cortical actin ( 77 % , n = 236 ) ( Fig 4F and 4G ) . However , some protrusions do not contain any detectable underlying actin ( 23 % , n = 236 ) , and these tend to be smaller than those with actin ( Fig 4F and 4G ) . We suspected that these actin - free protrusions may represent newly formed protrusions . Furthermore , in wild - type PLM cell bodies , the actin cytoskeleton is usually organized into stress fiber - like structures ( Fig 4H ) [ 30 ] . However , when ectopic protru - sions were induced by chdp - 1 over - expression , most of the actin signal was shifted to the cortex region underlying those ectopic protrusions and no stress fiber - like structures could be found in the center of the PLM cell bodies , where the nucleus is located ( Fig 4I ) . Together , these results suggest that CHDP - 1 promotes the formation of cell protrusions in vivo . CHDP - 1 does not bind to actin Membrane expansion must be coupled with the actin network to efficiently promote protru - sion . Can the cortex - localized CHDP - 1 protein associate with actin , thus coupling membrane expansion to actin rearrangement ? Interestingly , a tandem array of type I or II CH domains has been shown to possess actin - binding activity [ 23 , 24 ] . Therefore , we tested whether the CHDP - 1 protein can self - associate by performing co - precipitation assays on 293T cells trans - fected with Flag - and Myc - tagged CHDP - 1 . We found that CHDP - 1 molecules can indeed bind to each other ( Fig 5A ) . Truncation analysis indicated that the self - association of CHDP - 1 is mediated by the CH domain ( Fig 5B ) . We next tested whether CHDP - 1 can bind to actin . We firstly examined whether CHDP - 1 binds to monomeric ( G ) actin . Flag - tagged CHDP - 1 did not co - precipitate with worm actin ACT - 1 ( Fig 5C ) , suggesting that CHDP - 1 does not associate with G - actin . Next , we purified the mCherry : : CHDP - 1 protein ( Fig 5D ) and per - formed co - sedimentation experiments with polymerized filamentous ( F ) actin . As shown in S2D Fig , the actin motor myosin co - sedimented with F - actin , and this myosin - actin association could be disrupted by ATP . In contrast , CHDP - 1 was not sedimented with F - actin at all ( Fig 5E ) . Together , these results indicate that CHDP - 1 probably does not promote the formation of cell protrusions through direct actin binding . CHDP - 1 directly associates with Rac1 / CED - 10 To understand how CHDP - 1 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton to regulate protrusion for - mation , we searched for CHDP - 1 - interacting molecules by performing immunoprecipitation ( IP ) followed by mass spectrometry ( MS ) . With this approach , we identified the Rho small GTPase family member Rac1 / CED - 10 [ 31 ] . The worm Rac1 homolog , CED - 10 , is localized to plasma membranes [ 32 ] ( Fig 6A ) . In developing PLM neurons , CED - 10 co - localizes with CHDP - 1 at the periphery of the PLM cell body as well as on the surface of the protrusion region ( Fig 6B and 6C ) . This implies that CHDP - 1 and CED - 10 may interact with each other at the cell cortex in vivo . To test whether CHDP - 1 directly binds to CED - 10 , we performed the following experi - ments . Flag - tagged full - length CHDP - 1 and Myc - tagged CED - 10 were co - expressed in HEK293T cells . After affinity purification , the purified CHDP - 1 and CED - 10 were mixed together and co - immunoprecipitations were performed with Flag or Myc antibodies . In CHDP - 1 Couples Actin Dynamics to the Plasma Membrane PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006163 July 14 , 2016 8 / 20 contrast to the mock - transfected samples , CED - 10 was effectively co - precipitated with CHDP - 1 ( Fig 6D ) , and the purified CHDP - 1 protein was co - precipitated by CED - 10 ( Fig 6E ) . Thus , CHDP - 1 can directly bind to CED - 10 . To further identify the domain of CHDP - 1 that interacts with CED - 10 , we performed co - IP experiments using truncated CHDP - 1 fragments . We found that the CH domain of CHDP - 1 is crucial for the interaction with CED - 10 ( Fig 6F ) . Taken together , these results indicate that CHDP - 1 may bind to CED - 10 through its CH domain . CHDP - 1 preferentially binds to GTP - CED - 10 Coincidently , the BDU - PLM disconnection mutant screen identified a new ced - 10 allele , xd33 ( Fig 6G and 6H ) . Imaging analysis further indicated that formation of cell protrusions is con - siderably repressed in xd33 mutant animals ( Fig 6H ) . xd33 is a C - to - T missense mutation resulting in a serine 22 - to - phenylalanine change ( S22F ) in CED - 10 . To understand the role of CED - 10 in BDU - PLM connection , we examined two other ced - 10 mutants , n1993 and n3246 and found that they both display similar BDU - PLM disconnection defects to xd33 ( Fig 6I ) .

In xd33 / n3246 trans - hetero - zygote animals , we found that BDU - PLM disconnection defect is similar to that of xd33 homo - zygote . Furthermore , when the wild - type ced - 10 gene was introduced into xd33 animals , the BDU - PLM connection could be largely restored ( S3 Fig ) , suggesting that the loss - of - function of ced - 10 is responsible for the membrane protrusion defect in the corresponding ced - 10 mutant worms . We further constructed chdp - 1 ( xd27 ) ; ced - 10 ( xd33 ) and chdp - 1 ( tm4947 ) ; ced - 10 Fig 6 . CHDP - 1 associates with CED - 10 . ( A ) CED - 10 localizes to the cell cortex .

As a member of the Rac family of GTPases , Rac1 cycles between the inactive GDP - bound form and the active GTP - bound form . We then asked how CHDP - 1 interacts with different forms of CED - 10 . The glycine to valine mutation at position 12 ( G12V ) , which is canonical for constitutive activation of Ras superfamily GTPases , mimics the GTP - bound active state . In contrast , the threonine to asparagine mutation at position 17 ( T17N ) mimics the GDP - bound inactive state . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments with these two mutant forms of CED - 10 showed that the CHDP - 1 protein precipitates much higher levels of the G12V mutant than the T17N mutant ( Fig 7A and 7B ) . This suggests that CHDP - 1 preferentially associates with GTP - bound active CED - 10 . CHDP - 1 facilitates the cell cortex localization of CED - 10 Both CHDP - 1 and CED - 10 localize to the cell margin . How does the direct association of CHDP - 1 contribute to regulation of CED - 10 function ? In chdp - 1 mutant animals , we found that the cortex localization of CED - 10 is partially lost ( Fig 7C and 7D ) . In contrast , localization of CHDP - 1 to the cell margin remains intact in various ced - 10 mutants , including ced - 10 ( xd33 ) , ced - 10 ( n1993 ) and ced - 10 ( n3246 ) ( Fig 7E and S3 Fig ) . Cell - fractionation assays further indicated that the proportion of membrane - bound CED - 10 is reduced in chdp - 1 mutants com - pared with wild - type samples ( Fig 7F ) . The reduction of membrane - bound CED - 10 suggested that the level of GTP - bound , active CED - 10 protein maybe decreased in chdp - 1 mutants . Therefore , we further tested the GTP - CED - 10 level in vivo . Active GTP - Rac1 binds to the CRIB ( Cdc and Rac interactive binding ) domain of its effector PAK , while inactive GDP - Rac1 does not [ 34 ] . Thus , we performed pull - down assays on the PAK CRIB domain . In contrast to wild type , we found that the amount of GFP - tagged CED - 10 pulled down by the PAK CRIB domain was considerably decreased in chdp - 1 lysates ( Fig 7G and 7H ) . Together , these data suggested that CHDP - 1 facilitates the cell margin localization of CED - 10 in vivo by stabilizing the active GTP - bound CED - 10 protein . CED - 10 is required for CHDP - 1 - induced cell protrusion As the critical regulator of actin dynamics , is CED - 10 required for CHDP - 1 - induced cell pro - trusion ? We showed that over - expression of CHDP - 1 leads to extensive cell protrusion in PLM cell bodies . In three different ced - 10 mutants , however , the ectopic protrusion on the surface of PLM cell bodies is significantly reduced . We measured the size of the PLM cell body ( Fig 7I ) . In wild - type animals , the maximum area of a PLM cell body is about 26 μ m 2 . In chdp - 1 over - expression animals , the area of the PLM cell body is expanded to around 138 μ m 2 . In ced - 10 mutant animals , the area of the PLM cell body is 57 μ m 2 ( xd33 ) , 72 μ m 2 ( n1933 ) and 64 μ m 2 ( n3246 ) respectively ( Fig 7I ) . We then examined how CED - 10 coordinates with CHDP - 1 on the ectopic protrusions . After co - injecting mec - 7 promoter - driven rfp : : chdp - 1 and gfp : : ced - 10 constructs into wild - type animals , we found that most , if not all , CHDP - 1 and CED - 10 are co - distributed on the ectopic cell protrusions ( Fig 7J ) . Very few protrusions contain either CHDP - 10 ( 6 . 3 % ) or CED - 10 ( 1 . 9 % ) , suggesting a tight association of CHDP - 1 and CED - 10 on those ectopic protrusions . Next , we tested whether the previously described “ actin - free ” protrusions contain CED - 10 or not . Co - labeling of PLM cells with mCherry : : ACT - 1 and GFP : : CED - 10 showed that while the majority of protrusions ( 69 . 2 % ) contain both CED - 10 and actin , a significant proportion CHDP - 1 Couples Actin Dynamics to the Plasma Membrane PLOS Genetics | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1006163 July 14 , 2016 11 / 20 Fig 7 .

Thus , CED - 10 is likely more closely associated with CHDP - 1 than with actin to mediate protrusion formation ( S3 Fig ) . Discussion Coupling membrane expansion to actin filaments dynamics is essential for formation of mem - brane protrusions . In this report , we identified that the calponin - like protein CHDP - 1 pro - motes membrane protrusion and associates with the Rac1 / CED - 10 GTPase in C . elegans ( S3 Fig ) . Two mechanisms of membrane deformation have been linked to the direct binding of pro - teins to the membrane . One utilizes the electrostatic interactions between the lipid - binding domains on the protein surface and the negatively charged lipids in the membrane . An out - standing example of this class of lipid - binding domain is the BAR domain . BAR domains usu - ally form dimers and the lipid - binding surface of BAR has intrinsic curvature [ 35 ] . In particular , the I - BAR family , with its cigar - shaped dimers , can promote negative curvatures , which are frequently found inside plasma membrane protrusions [ 36 ] . In addition to interact - ing electrostatically with lipids , BAR proteins can also recruit other proteins , which may fur - ther modify the membrane deformation . IRSp53 ( insulin receptor phosphotyrosine 53 kDa ) consists of an N - terminal I - BAR domain , followed by a partial CRIB domain and an SH3 domain . Through the CRIB domain , IRSp53 binds to Cdc42 [ 37 ] , which regulates the forma - tion of filopodia in mammalian cells [ 38 , 39 ] . Through its SH3 domain , IRSp53 also associates with a set of actin regulatory factors , including WAVE1 , WAVE2 , Mena , mDia1 , dynamin , and N - WASp [ 40 ] . Thus , IRSp53 allows tight coupling of membrane protrusions to actin dynamics . Direct protein insertion into the membrane is another mechanism used to alter membrane curvature . This mechanism of membrane deformation was first characterized for proteins containing an amphipathic helix ; the cylindrical helix lies parallel to the membrane , exposing its hydrophilic surface to the cytosol [ 41 ] . However , it is unlikely that a single mole - cule or a single dimer could act alone to deform the membrane . The assembly of many mole - cules at the same place on the membrane may be required for deformation . Indeed , in bacteria , the peripheral membrane protein MinD , which contains a highly similar amphipathic helix to CHDP - 1 , forms polymers and the polymerization of MinD proteins enhances the membrane affinity of the single amphipathic helix domain [ 29 ] . Given the fact that CHDP - 1 molecules can associate with each other , it is a reasonable proposal that the assembly of chains of CHDP - 1 molecules may create sufficient membrane curvature to deform the plasma membrane . What is the biological significance of the enlarged plasma membrane surface ? During the formation of neuronal connections , the distal tips of axons extend highly dynamic membrane expansions , the growth cones , to actively search for environmental cues that will guide them toward their proper target cells [ 27 ] . We previously showed that Wnt signaling is involved in BDU - PLM connection [ 26 ] . Therefore , it is possible that CHDP - 1 promotes the formation of cell protrusions in order to increase the sensitivity of BDU and PLM neurons to detect Wnt sig - nals . Interestingly , the expression of chdp - 1 in either BDU or PLM alone significantly rescued ced - 10 ( n1993 ) mutants . ( F ) In a cell fractionation assay , the amount of GFP : : CED - 10 on the plasma membrane is decreased in chdp - 1 ( xd27 ) mutants .

Given the fact that BDU and PLM neurites can elongate towards each other in both wild - type and chdp - 1 mutant animals , we suspect that the growth cone protrusion may be specifically required for the final short - range extension of the neurite tip , but is not necessary for long - distance travel of a neurite . It is currently unclear whether similar principles apply to other neuronal connections in vivo . How does CHDP - 1 couple membrane protrusion to the actin cytoskeleton ? CHDP - 1 con - tains a single CH domain , which shares similarity to that in the mammalian calponin family . In the phylogenetic tree of CH domain - containing proteins , calponins form a separate branch together with other proteins that possess a single CH domain ( Vav , IQGAP , ARH - GEF6 , and SM22 ) [ 23 ] . Another calponin homolog , CPN - 1 ( CaPoNin - 1 ) , can partially fulfill the func - tional requirement for CHDP - 1 in BDU - PLM connection ( reducing the frequency of discon - nection from around 95 % in chdp - 1 ( xd27 ) mutant animals to 60 % ) , suggesting that CHDP - 1 is likely also derived from an ancestral protein in C . elegans . The isolated CH domains of calponin family proteins fail to associate with F - actin [ 25 ] . Instead , they bind to a variety of cytoskeleton and signaling components , including tubulin , intermediate filament , ROCK ( Rho - associated kinase ) , ERK1 , and ERK2 [ 25 ] . It has therefore been suggested that calponin functions as a scaffolding protein for cytoskeletal structures and / or adaptor molecules in signaling pathways . Here , we found that the CH domain of CHDP - 1 does not bind to either G - or F - actin , but instead binds to the Rac1 homolog CED - 10 . This suggests that CHDP - 1 may influence actin cytoskeleton dynamics by directly regulating Rac1 / CED - 10 . Intriguingly , CHDP - 1 preferen - tially associates with GTP - bound active CED - 10 . In addition , the plasma membrane localiza - tion of CED - 10 is impaired in the absence of CHDP - 1 . Coincidently , expression of constitutively active CED - 10 in C . elegans promotes extensive branching [ 42 ] , suggesting that Rac1 plays an important role in actin polymerization . Another interesting observation is that CHDP - 1 molecules may associate with each other also through the CH domain . We suspect that the assembly of chains of CHDP - 1 molecules may create sufficiently large membrane pro - trusions , as well as providing anchor sites for numerous CED - 10 molecules , which will effi - ciently recruit cortical actin to stabilize the protrusions . Thus , CHDP - 1 promotes plasma membrane protrusion and stabilizes the expanded membrane by promoting actin cytoskeleton rearrangement through interaction with Rac1 / CED - 10 . Materials and Methods C . elegans genetics Culture and manipulation of C . elegans strains were performed using standard methods . Mutants used in this studies are : LGI , chdp - 1 ( xd27 ) , chdp - 1 ( tm4947 ) ; LGII , juIs76 ( Punc - 25 : : GFP ) ; LGIV , ced - 10 ( n1993 ) , ced - 10 ( xd33 ) , ced - 10 ( n3246 ) , kyIs262 ( P unc - 86 : : MYR : : GFP , P odr - 1 : : dsRed ) . The xd27 and xd33 mutations were isolated from kyIs262 ( P unc - 86 : : Myr : : GFP ) ani - mals treated with EMS . A total of 2 , 500 mutagenized haploid genomes were screened . The iso - lated strains were outcrossed with the N2 strain at least four times . Generation of transgenic lines and constructs Corresponding chdp - 1 DNA fragments were amplified from N2 genomic DNA to perform the chdp - 1 cloning experiment . chdp - 1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription . ced - 10 cDNA was obtained from Dr . Yuji Kohara . GFP sequence was inserted into P chdp - 1 : : CHDP - 1 con - structs . For protein co - localization , the RFP fragment was inserted into the P mec - 7 : : CHDP - 1 construct .

In general , plasmid DNAs of interest were injected at 10 - 50ng / μ l and the co - injection markers P odr - 1 : : RFP , rol - 6 or P odr - 1 : : GFP were injected at 10 - 50ng / μ l . The corre - sponding transgenes and constructs are listed in ( S1 Table ) . Image collection and phenotypic quantification Animals were mounted on 2 % agar pads in M9 buffer containing 1 % 1 - phenoxy - 2 - propanol and examined by fluorescence microscopy unless indicated otherwise . Fluorescence photo - graphs were taken using a Zeiss Axioimager A1 with an AxioCam digital camera and Axiovi - sion rel . 4 . 6 software ( Carl Zeiss ) or an IX81 Olympus inverted confocal microscope . Contact was considered defective if the BDU neurite failed to touch the PLM neurite . Neurite and worm body lengths were measured with NIH ImageJ software . The length of each neurite was traced from the center of the cell body to the tip of neurite . The length of each animal was mea - sured from the center of the PLM cell body to the tip of the nose . The relative BDU or PLM neurite length is defined as neurite length / animal length . The PLM cell body was measured using ImageJ software . To measure the co - distribution of actin , CED - 10 and CHDP - 1 on ectopic protrusions , fluorescence photographs were taken using confocal microscopy . The size of individual protrusions was measured with NIH Image J software using the line - tracing tool . All data are shown as mean ± SD . Statistical analyses were performed with Student ’ s t - test . For each genotype , more than 20 animals were analyzed . Quantification of membrane protrusions At different time points , eggs were mounted on thin 1 % agar pads in M9 buffer ; gentle pressure was applied to crack the egg shells , and embryos were examined immediately by fluorescence microscopy . To measure the membrane protrusion area , newly hatched L1 animals were col - lected and photographs were taken within 10 min of hatching . The expansion area was defined by linking the first branching or elaboration site of the neurite with the tips of all the branches or filopodia . The area was measured with NIH ImageJ software . Quantification of membrane localization of CED - 10 Some chdp - 1 ( xd27 ) embryos die at the later elongation stage . Therefore we dissected gravid adults and obtained embryos at early developmental stages ( from the 16 - cell stage to gastrula - tion stage ) . Then the collected embryos were mounted on thin 1 % agar pads in M9 buffer and examined immediately by fluorescence microscopy . Embryos in which at least half of the cells contained diffuse GFP : : CED - 10 or GFP : : CHDP - 1 signal were considered as showing defective localization of the GFP : : CED - 10 or GFP : : CHDP - 1 marker . All images were collected using Zeiss Axioimager A1 with an AxioCam digital camera and Axiovision rel . 4 . 6 software ( Carl Zeiss ) . For each sample , at least 50 embryos were scored . Time - lapse imaging Newly hatched L1 animals were anesthetized with 0 . 1mM levamisole in M9 buffer and mounted on 2 % agar pads at 22°C . Time - lapse images were captured every 1 . 5 min using a Delta - vision Core imaging system ( Applied Precision ) with an UPLSApo 100 6 / 1 . 40NAoil - immersion objective and a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ camera . Deconvolution and analysis of images were performed with Softworx ( Applied Precision ) .

Specifically , worms were collected and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer ( Cheng - He Company , Zhuhai , China ) [ 43 ] in pre - chilled homogenizing buffer ( 50mM Tris - Cl pH8 . 0 , NaCl 150mM , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Triton - X 100 , protease inhibitor [ Roche ] ) , then incubated for 15 min on ice , and centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C . The supernatants were incubated with GFP polyclonal antibody ( Rabbit , Abcam , ab290 , 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ) overnight , and then incubated with protein A agarose beads ( Cat # 17 - 0780 - 01 , GE ) for 4 hr at 4°C . The pellet was washed three times in washing buffer ( 50mM Tris - Cl pH8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 mM PMSF ) , and then boiled in sample buffer for 5 min . The boiled samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE gel and protein bands of interest were excised from SDS - PAGE gel and in - gel digestion was performed using a well - established protocol with slight modifications [ 44 ] . Briefly , the proteins embedded in gel slices were reduced with 10mM DTT and alkylated with 55mM iodoacetamide , and then digested overnight with sequencing grade trypsin ( Sigma , USA ) at 37°C . The tryptic peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer ( AB SCIEX , Canada ) coupled to an EksigentNa - noLC . Peptide identification and quantification were performed with the ProteinPilot 4 . 2 soft - ware ( AB SCIEX ) . The C . elegans proteome sequences ( Uniprot ) was used as the database and the mass tolerance was set to 0 . 05 Da for the database search . The false discovery rate ( FDR ) analysis was performed using the software PSPEP integrated with ProteinPilot . About 10 cyto - skeleton - related proteins were identified in the mass spectrometry analysis . GST pull - down and co - immunoprecipitation assays were then performed to verify the putative protein - protein interactions . Among the tested proteins , CED - 10 displayed consistent CHDP - 1 - binding activ - ity in both GST pull - down and co - immunoprecipitation assays . Co - immunoprecipitation cDNA fragments were amplified and cloned into modified pcDNATM3 . 1 / myc - HIS ( - ) or pFLAG - CMV - 2 vectors through standard procedures . HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 12 % FBS . Plasmid transfections were carried out using Lipofecta - mine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . 24 hours after transfection , cells were harvested and lysed for 30 min at 4°C . After centrifugation , the supernatants were incubated with anti - FLAG M2 affinity gel beads at 4°C overnight and then washed three times with washing buffer and incubated with SDS - sample buffer . Samples were resolved by standard immunoblotting techniques . To quan - tify the binding affinity between CHDP - 1 and different CED - 10 mutant proteins ( G12V and T17N mutant forms ) , the absolute signal intensity of individual protein bands was analyzed with ImageJ . The relative protein level was achieved by subtracting the respective FLAG con - trol . For binding experiments with truncated CHDP - 1 , the following fragments were used : FN ( AA 1 – 146 ) , CH ( AA 121 – 242 ) and FC ( AA 243 – 338 ) . All the co - immunoprecipitation experi - ments were repeated at least three times . F - actin sedimentation The Actin Binding Protein Spin - Down Biochem Kit ( Cat . # BK001 ) from Cytoskeleton Inc was used to detect the F - actin binding activity of CHDP - 1 . The recombinant proteins Flag : : mCherry : : CHDP - 1 and Flag : : mCherry were expressed in HEK293FT cells . 24 hours after trans - fection , cells were harvested and lysed for 30 min at 4°C . After centrifugation , the correspond - ing supernatants were incubated with anti - FLAG M2 affinity gel beads at 4°C for purification of tagged proteins . F - actin was prepared from muscle actin and suspended in general actin buffer at room temperature for 1 hour .

Subse - quently , protein samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE gel . The muscle myosin was used as a positive control for F - actin binding assay . Cell fractionation Wild - type and chdp - 1 ( xd27 ) worms expressing P ced - 10 : : GFP : : CED - 10 were collected and washed in M9 buffer . Then 500 μ l lysis buffer ( 250 mM sucrose , 50 mM Tris – HCl pH6 . 8 , 1 mM EDTA ) were added and the samples were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer ( Cheng - He Company , Zhuhai , China ) ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) on ice for 15 min . The nuclear pellet was removed by centrifuging at 3 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C . The supernatant was further centri - fuged at 40 , 000 rpm for 1 hr . The new supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction . The pellet was further washed and centrifuged at 40 , 000 rpm for 45 min to obtain the membrane fraction . All samples were boiled with 2xSDS loading buffer then subjected to 10 % SDS - PAGE gel analysis . PAK - RBD pull - down assay PAK - GST protein beads ( human P21 activated kinase PBD ) were used to detect the GTP - bound form of CED - 10 . Worm lysates were prepared from wild type and chdp - 1 ( xd27 ) mutant animals carrying P ced - 10 : : GFP : : CED - 10 . Worms were lysed in pre - chilled homogenizing buffer with a Dounce homogenizer ( Cheng - He Company , Zhuhai , China ) and incubated for 15 min on ice , then centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C . The supernatants were incu - bated with PAK - GST protein beads ( Cat # PAK02 , Cytoskeleton Inc ) for 4 hr at 4°C . The pellet was washed three times and then boiled in sample buffer for 5 min . The boiled samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE and detected with anti - GFP antibody . The pull - down experiments were repeated three times . The absolute intensity of each protein band was quantified with ImageJ . The relative protein level was determined by normalizing each sample with the corre - sponding input , and then normalizing each chdp - 1 ( xd27 ) sample with the paired WT sample .
