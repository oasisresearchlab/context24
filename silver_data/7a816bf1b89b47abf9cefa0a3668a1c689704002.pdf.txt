Loss of aminoacylation is not required for their pathogenicity , suggesting a gain - of - function disease mechanism . By an unbiased genetic screen in Drosophila , we link YARS1 dysfunction to actin cytoskeleton organization . Biochemical stu - dies uncover yet unknown actin - bundling property of YARS1 to be enhanced by a CMT mutation , leading to actin disorganization in the Drosophila nervous system , human SH - SY5Y neuroblastoma cells , and patient - derived ﬁ broblasts . Genetic modulation of F - actin organization improves hallmark electro - physiological and morphological features in neurons of ﬂ ies expressing CMT - causing YARS1 mutations . Similar bene ﬁ cial effects are observed in ﬂ ies expressing a neuropathy - causing glycyl - tRNA synthetase . Hence , in this work , we show that YARS1 is an evolutionary - conserved F - actin organizer which links the actin cytoskeleton to tRNA - synthetase - induced neurodegeneration . Protein translation is a fundamental cellular process in which aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases play a major role . These ubiquitous enzymes are responsible for the continuous and correct charging of tRNAs with their cognate amino acids during protein biosynthesis ( canonical function ) 1 . Dominant mutations in tyrosyl - tRNA synthetase ( YARS1 ) and six other synthetases cause different subtypes of Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease ( CMT ) 2 – 4 , the most common and currently incurable inherited peripheral neuropathy 5 . The pathology is mostly restricted to the axons of the peripheral nerves that degenerate in a length - dependent , dying - back fashion upon disease progression . How monoallelic genetic defects in such ubiquitous enzymes can cause selective damage of the peripheral nerves is not fully understood . Extensive evidence from us and others demonstrates that , at least for YARS1 , glycyl - tRNA synthetase ( GARS1 ) and alanyl - tRNA synthetase ( AARS1 ) , the CMT phenotype cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of aminoacylation ( reviewed in refs . 2 , 3 ) . Rather , a growing list of diverse noncanonical functions is being described for these enzymes 2 , 6 , 7 . CMT mutations could disrupt those non - aminoacylation activities or gen - erate completely novel neurotoxic properties of the affected synthetases . To search for commonalities in the mode of action of the mutant synthetases , systematic structural studies have been performed . Notably , the CMT mutations in GARS1 8 , YARS1 9 , HARS1 10 , and AARS1 11 , cause 3D - conformational opening that exposes sequences buried within the wild - type enzymes , thereby impacting their interaction properties . ThestructuralrelaxationofmutantGARS1andAARS1leads to a neomorphic interaction with the transmembrane receptor Neu - ropilin1 8 , 11 , whiletheconformationalopeningcausedbythreedifferent CMT mutations in YARS1 increases the binding af ﬁ nity to TRIM28 12 , compared with the wild type proteins .

Inthisstudy , wefocusedonYARS1 , acytoplasmictRNAligasewith additional nuclear roles in transcriptional regulation and response to oxidative stress 13 , as well as extracellular signaling 14 . All ﬁ ve known CMT - causing mutations are in the catalytic domain of the protein 2 , 3 , and yet YARS1 E196K does not impair the enzyme kinetics 12 . Notably , when expressed in Drosophila , YARS1 E196K — similarly to the aminoacylation - compromised YARS1 G41R and YARS1 153 - 156delVKQV — indu - ces phenotypes recapitulating hallmark features of the human pathology , including motor de ﬁ cits , electrophysiological neuronal dysfunctionandaxonterminaldegeneration 15 . Inthepresentstudy , we performed an unbiased genetic screen in the Drosophila model and together with in cellulo interactomics linked YARS1 dysfunction to the actin cytoskeleton organization . Further , we observed that YARS1 directly binds and bundles F - actin ﬁ laments in vitro , and induces cytoskeletal rearrangements in CMT - relevant paradigms . The actin cytoskeleton is a major part of the cellular backbone , de ﬁ ning cell shape , dynamics , and internal organization , and is com - posed of actin ﬁ laments ( F - actin ) resulting from ATP - dependent reversible polymerization of globular actin ( G - actin ) 16 . Individual F - actin ﬁ laments are crosslinked into higher - order structures , such as bundles and branched networks , which drive a wide range of cellular processes , includingcellmotility , celladhesion , intracellulartransport , endocytosis , and cytokinesis . These processes require the precisely choreographed assembly , rearrangement , and turnover of actin net - works , which is achieved by the concerted actions of a multitude of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) . In neurons , actin rearrangements drive many processes , including neurite outgrowth and sprouting , vesicle dynamics , as well as stability or instability of the synapse 17 . Emerging evidence implicates regulation of the actin cytoskeleton as a causative anddysregulated processinneuronopathies . Altered actindynamicsis observed in experimental models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) 17 , and increased pro ﬁ lin - 2 levels are detected in iPSC - motoneuron models of different CMT subtypes 18 . Moreover , human genetic studies show that mutations in actin - regulatoryproteins ( pro ﬁ lin - 1 , alsin ) causesubtypesofALS , while actin - binding and / or bundling proteins ( plastin - 3 , coronin ) are high - risk factors or suppressors of ALS and SMA , respectively 18 , 19 . In this work , we report actin binding and bundling functions for YARS1 , and demonstrate that they are relevant for CMT pathogenesis , as genetic manipulations of the actin cytoskeleton rescue cellular hallmarks of the neuropathy in Drosophila . Furthermore , we demon - strate that F - actin binding is a common feature for other disease - implicated synthetases and its manipulation can be bene ﬁ cial for GARS1 neuropathy . Our ﬁ ndings support a common molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration involving the actin cytoskeleton . Results Genetic screen identi ﬁ es actin - related YARS1 CMT interactors To identify the mechanistic basis of YARS1 CMT toxicity , we performed an unbiased genetic modi ﬁ er screen in Drosophila , as retinal ( GMR - Gal4 ) expression of the enzymatically active YARS1 E196K mutant makes ﬂ y eye ommatidia sensitive to disorganization . This sensitivity offers a robust , simple , and high - throughput test , which has been widely used for discovery of genetic modi ﬁ ers of neurodegenerative diseases in Drosophila 20 . Notably , there is a major overlap of neurodegenerative pathways eliciting toxicity in the ﬂ y ’ s developing eye and postmitotic neurons 21 and we have previously demonstrated that this read - out enables the identi ﬁ cation of CMT - relevant phenotypic enhancers 9 . Using the adult ﬂ y eye as a screening platform , we systematically examined 557 Drosophila lines containing enhancer - promoter P - ele - ment insertions ( EP s ) 22 – 25 on the X - chromosome ( Fig . 1a ) . The combi - nation of EPs , carrying Gal4 - binding sites and a Gal4 - source provides a modular system that will determine the expression of any gene downstream of the EP insertion site 22 . Depending on the genomic insertion , an EP could overexpress the downstream gene in the pre - sence of a Gal4 - source , misexpress partial products of it , or induce a hypomorph if the insertion disrupts the gene coding sequence . Many of the EPs ( 72 . 3 % ) we screened were inserted in proximity of genes encoding proteins belonging to different functional classes ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1b , c , Supplementary Data 1 ) . 96 % of the screened EPs did not affect ommatidial organization ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . We excluded from further analysis EPs that gave retinal phenotypes on their own ( 2 . 15 % ) , induced lethality ( 0 . 36 % ) or had nonspeci ﬁ c , com - parable effects when co - expressed with either YARS1 E196K or YARS1 WT ( 1 . 26 % ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Ultimately , we detected a strong rough eye phenotype upon GMR - Gal4 - driven co - expression of YARS1 E196K andthe BDSC _ 14274 ( Fim EP ) line , unliketheminorommatidial disorganization when Fim EP was expressed alone or together with YARS1 WT ( Fig . 1c ) . Fim EP maps upstream of the gene Fimbrin ( CG8649 / Fim ) , in an orientation that will promote the expression of Fim and not theneighboring CG5445 , asevidenced by theup - regulationof itsthree splice - isoforms in the presence of a Gal4 source ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . Next , we tested all publicly available EPs inserted in the direction of Fim expression at different locations of the gene ( see Methods ) and found an additional EP inserted in Fim that induced mild ommatidial disorganization when co - expressed speci ﬁ cally with YARS1 E196K – BDSC _ 19171 ( Fim XP ) ( Supplementary Figs . 1d , 2a ) . Thus , we identi ﬁ ed two independent EPs inserted in the Fim gene that are mutant - speci ﬁ c YARS1 genetic enhancers . Fim is the sole , highly conserved Drosophila orthologue of a family of actin binding and - bundling proteins , which in humans are encoded by three Plastin ( PLS ) genes with distinct expression patterns ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To con ﬁ rm the interaction with Fim / PLS , we generated UAS - transgenes of full - length Drosophila Fim ( upregulating all Fim isoforms ) , as well as of human PLS2 and PLS3 ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Retinal co - expression of Fim ( Fig . 1d ) , PLS2 ( Fig . 1e ) or PLS3 ( Fig . 1f ) with YARS1 E196K induced a rough eye phenotype , while all were neutral in the YARS1 WT background . Thus , overexpression of either Drosophila or human versions of the actin bundler Fim / PLS enhanced the YARS1 E196K - associated eye phenotypes in Drosophila . TofurtherexplorethelinkbetweenYARS1andtheF - actin - binding genetic interactor , we tested the modi ﬁ cation effect of 23 candidates from a network of physically and genetically interacting partners of Fim and YARS1 ( DroID database 26 ) , belonging to various functional classes ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . We found that up - regulation of two additional actin - binding proteins ( Coro and its close homolog dPod1 ) or loss of a regulator of F - actin bundling in ﬂ ies ( the IKK ε kinase ) 27 caused rough eye phenotypes when co - expressed with YARS1 E196K ( Supplementary Fig . 1f ) . Independently , PLS3 and other actin binding proteins , including other F - actin bundlers , were captured in immunoprecipitation experiments in human ( HEK293 ) cells expressing FLAG - YARS1 WT , but not the FLAG - tag alone ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b , Supplementary Data2 ) . WetestedtheinteractionwithPLS3and α - actinininvitrousing recombinant proteins and found no direct binding with YARS1 ( Sup - plementary Fig . 4c , d ) , suggesting that YARS1 and these ABPs might be constituents of a complex with another common interacting partner . YARS1 binds F - actin and organizes actin ﬁ laments in vitro The recurrent association between YARS1 and proteins with actin - binding properties prompted us to explore whether the synthetase might directly bind actin . Initially , we tested the capacity of puri ﬁ ed recombinant YARS1 to bind actin ﬁ laments in well - established co - sedimentation in vitro assays . Variable concentrations of pre - assembled F - actin were incubated with 0 . 5 µ M recombinant YARS1 WT or YARS1 E196K , and actin ﬁ laments were subsequently pelleted by high - speed centrifugation .

However , YARS1 shifted to the pellet fractionwithincreasingconcentrationsofF - actin ( Fig . 2a ) , similartoan established actin - binding protein ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) , indicating that YARS1 binds directly to actin ﬁ laments . Based on the dissociation constants ( K D s ) obtained from thisexperiment ( Fig . 2b ) , weconcluded that both YARS1 WT and YARS1 E196K have similar binding af ﬁ nities for preassembled F - actin . Next , we assessed whether the binding of YARS1 to actin has any functional impact on F - actin assembly . We performed in vitro F - actin polymerization in the presence of recombinant YARS1 followed by differential centrifugation . High - speed centrifugation pulls down all F - actin ﬁ laments regardless of whether they are single ﬁ laments or organized into higher - order structures , while low - speed sedimenta - tion pellets only larger , higher - order F - actin assemblies , including bundles . In our case , high - speed pelleting of the reaction mixture demonstrated that YARS1 did not change the steady - state ratio of G - actin ( supernatant ) vs . F - actin ( pellet ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5b , c ) , suggesting it does not alter the critical concentration for actin assembly .

Upon incubation of increasing concentrations of YARS1 pro - teins with 2 µ M preassembled F - actin , both YARS1 WT and YARS1 E196K showed bundling capacity , demonstrated by the progressive shift of F - actin from the supernatant ( single ﬁ laments ) to the pellet fraction ( bundled ﬁ laments ) ( Fig . 2c – e ) . Surprisingly , YARS1 E196K induced F - actin bundling already at 1 μ M , and progressively shifted F - actin to the low - speed pellet at higher concentrations , saturating its effects at 4 μ M YARS1 E196K . YARS1 WT initiated a shift of F - actin to the pellet ( i . e . , bundled ﬁ laments ) only at 2 μ M . At 4 µ M concentration both proteins comparably bundled most of the F - actin . To further demonstrate the bundling activity of YARS1 in real time we used total internal re ﬂ ection microscopy ( TIRF ) assays . Non - tethered Oregon Green ( OG ) - labeled actin ﬁ laments were grown in TIRF chambers , where their organization in higher order structures was imaged after a ﬂ ow in of F - buffer ( control ) or YARS1 ( see scheme in Fig . 2f ) . F - actin bundle formation was detected in this assay using 0 . 5 µ M YARS1 , and a stronger effect was observed for the same concentration of the mutant protein ( Fig . 2f , g ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) . At a higher concentration ( 2 µ M ) , both YARS1 WT and YAR - S1 E196K induced bundling , with most of the initial individual ﬁ laments merging into thicker F - actin cables ( Fig . 2g ; Supplementary Fig . 5f , g ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) . In control reactions ( buffer alone ) , we observed no signi ﬁ cant bundling of ﬁ laments in the 20 min obser - vation window . Altogether , we demonstrate that YARS1 binds to F - actin and organizes actin ﬁ laments into tight long bundles . The concentration ( and the associated K D s ) at which both wild type and mutant YARS1 bind to F - actin is in the range of known established bundlers 28 , 29 . This previously unknown property of YARS1 is stronger in the tested CMT - associated mutant . To evaluate if actin - bundling affects the canonical tRNA ligase activity , we measured the aminoacylation activity of YARS1 in the presence of F - actin . No changes in the tRNA - charging activity of YARS1 WT or YARS1 E196K were detected in vitro ( Supplementary Fig . 5h ) . These data suggest that at least at the concentrations tested , F - actin binding or bundling do not signi ﬁ cantly interfere with the canonical role of YARS1 . Finally , since the actin - binding and bundling properties of YARS1 resemble the function of its genetic ( but not physical ) interactor PLS3 , we asked whether they will in ﬂ uence each other ’ s binding to actin . Indeed , the individual bundlers can be coming on and off ﬁ lament sides while the group of molecules collectively maintains a stable bundle 30 . We preincubated 2 μ M F - actin with 1 μ M PLS3 at three dif - ferent YARS1 concentrations , followed by high - speed co - sedimenta - tion ( Supplementary Fig . 5d , e ) . At the concentrations tested , we observed mild decrease of PLS3 in the ﬁ lamentous actin - rich pellet , indicating that YARS1 and PLS3 might bind to F - actin in a competitive manner . YARS1 CMT disrupts actin cytoskeleton organization in cellulo To complement our functional genomics and in vitro biochemical ﬁ ndings , we turned to mammalian cell models . We ﬁ rst explored the association of YARS1 with the actin cytoskeleton by co - transfecting HeLa cells with YARS1 - eGFP and the F - actin marker Lifeact - mCherry . We found YARS1 to be enriched at different F - actinassemblies , suchas parts of the cell cortex at the cell periphery ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Live cell imaging revealed YARS1 presence at highly dynamic protru - sions at cell borders , resembling F - actin - rich structures ( lamellipodia and associated membrane ruf ﬂ es ) 31 ( Supplementary Fig . 6b , Supple - mentary Movie 2 ) . Based on the presence of YARS1 at these dynamic actin - dependent protrusions , we next asked if YARS1 CMT will modify their features . To this end , we examined ﬁ broblasts from a control individual and a YARS1 E196K - patient , expressing mutant YARS1 at endo - genous levels . We plated the cells on micropatterns which provide the advantage of restricting the cell to adopt predetermined shape , con - trolling their substrate adhering compartments and the formation of characteristic actin networks 32 . Control ﬁ broblasts plated on Y - shaped micropatterns adopted a triangular shape and featured elongated F - actin structures ( stress ﬁ bers representing unbranched , contractile F - actin ) aligned with the triangular perimeter of the cells , as well as a branched actin meshwork at the cell apices 32 ( Fig . 3a – d ) . In YARS1 E196K ﬁ broblasts , irregularities in the F - actin pattern were observed , ranging from absent or shorter stress ﬁ bers to aberrant apical and central F - actin accumulations . In both control and patient ﬁ broblasts , immu - nolabeled endogenous YARS1 was distributed throughout the cyto - plasm , along the stress ﬁ bers and at the apices enriched in F - actin accumulations , especiallyintheCMTcells ( Fig . 3e ) . Thus , CMTpatient - derived ﬁ broblasts exhibit defects in actin cytoskeleton organization . Next , we studied human SH - SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably expressing YARS1 WT or CMT - causing mutants ( YARS1 E196K and YARS1 G41R ) ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – c ) . We assessed global migration properties of non - differentiated wild type and mutant cells , in responsetoamechanicalscratchincon ﬂ uentculturesbyfollowingthe scratch closure within 72 h ( Fig . 4a ) . In line with potential actin cytos - keletondefects , we found signi ﬁ cantlyslower cell migrationin the two CMT - mutant cell lines compared to YARS1 WT in the ﬁ rst 24 h ( Fig . 4b ) . To demonstrate that the impaired global migration is a result of dis - crete cellular defects in the YARS1 CMT cell lines , we performed faster phase - contrast microscopy at higher magni ﬁ cation and examined the formation and dynamics of individual lamellipodia ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Cells expressing YARS1 CMT displayed shorter protrusions that were less persistent and featured increased protrusion rate compared to the control cells ( Fig . 4e ) . Next , we examined for functional defects in differentiated SH - SY5Y neuron - like cells that feature primary neurites as well as secondary branches at day 8 of differentiation ( Fig . 4f ) . Interestingly , we found that YARS1 CMT cells develop signi ﬁ cantly shorter primary neurites and have a smaller fraction of secondary branches compared to controls ( Fig . 4g ) . Combined , these results showthatinSH - SY5Y - derivedneuron - likecellstheYARS1 CMT mutations impair the formation of protrusions known to heavily relay on func - tional actin cytoskeleton , and subsequent neurite outgrowth and branching . Fim modi ﬁ es neuronal phenotypes in the ﬂ y YARS1 CMT model To explore putative actin rearrangements and associated neuronal phenotypes in vivo , we examined the larval neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) of our YARS1 CMT Drosophila model . NMJs are model synapses considered to be a “ site of lesion ” in the dying - back axonopathies , including CMT 33 . We previously showed that YARS1 CMT induces an NMJ ’ s undergrowth , characterized by decreased total NMJ length and number of presynaptic specializations ( i . e . , boutons ) 9 . To look at neuronal actin cytoskeleton , we expressed the F - actin marker UAS - Lifeact ( Lifeact ) 34 pan - neuronally and observed F - actin to be enriched at the periphery of individual presynaptic specializations in control larvae . Either YARS1 WT or YARS1 E196K expression induced a distinct , more dispersed Lifeact signal ( Fig . 5a , Supplementary Fig . 8a ) , com - parable to overexpression of the actin bundler PLS3 ( Supplementary Fig . 8b , c ) . Similarly , co - expression of GFP - tagged Actin ( Act5C : : GFP ) with YARS1 and PLS3 demonstrated reduction of the number of pre - synaptic assemblies in boutons ( Supplementary Fig . 8d , e ) . Thus , independent use of actin and an actin marker demonstrated changes in the distribution and organization of presynaptic actin cytoskeleton upon YARS1 CMT expression aligned with the effect of the actin bund - ler PLS3 . At those NMJs , transgenic YARS1 was present in the boutons , as wellasintheaxonalcompartment ( SupplementaryFig . 9a , b ) , similarly to endogenous Fim ( Supplementary Fig . 9e , f ) . Furthermore , immu - nohistochemical analysis of the sub - bouton organization identi ﬁ ed YARS1 in proximity to synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) , as evidenced by co - localization with the marker proteins Synaptotagmin 1 ( Syt : : eGFP ) ( Supplementary Fig . 9c ) and Synapsin ( Supplementary Fig . 11a ) . Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 35908 - 3 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 999 5 Neuronally expressed PLS3 had a comparable distribution pattern ( Supplementary Fig . 9e , f ) . In contrast , no major overlap was observed between YARS1 and the active zone marker Bruchpilot ( Brp ) , or the periactive zone marker FasII ( Supplementary Fig . 11b , c ) . We next assessed the effects of mutant YARS1 on the mobility of synaptic vesicles at rest , a process dependent on F - actin dynamics 35 . Fluorescentrecoveryafterphotobleaching ( FRAP ) ofSyt : : eGFP - labeled SVs ( Fig . 5c ) , a method commonly used to evaluate the mobilization capacity of SVs 35 – 37 , revealed a reduced mobile fraction of SVs in boutons of larvae over - expressing two different YARS1 CMT proteins comparedto YARS1 WT larvae ( Fig . 5d ) . Weaskedwhethermodulationof the bundled state of the actin cytoskeleton would alleviate the de ﬁ cits in synaptic vesicle mobility . We reduced the endogenous levels of Fim ( Fim e03892 , Supplementary Fig . 2b ) , the mutant - speci ﬁ c genetic inter - actor of YARS1 , and this restored normal SV mobility in ﬂ ies over - expressing YARS1 CMT alleles ( Fig . 5c , d ; Supplementary Fig . 9d ) . Altogether , our ﬁ ndings suggest that YARS1 CMT mutations affect the organization of the presynaptic actin cytoskeleton and alter synaptic vesicle mobility at rest in the Drosophila model . Next , we assessedthe effect of genetically modulatingFim levels in the giant ﬁ ber ( GF ) circuit neurons in adult YARS1 CMT ﬂ ies , for which we previously reported electrophysiological and morpholo - gical defects 9 , 15 . Notably , GF interneurons have some of the longest axons in ﬂ ies , making them particularly relevant for modeling axo - nopathies like CMT . The GF / tergotrochanteral muscle motoneuron ( GF / TTMn ) synapse has decreased responsiveness in animals expressing different YARS1 CMT alleles ( reduction of ~ 50 % and ~ 80 % upon expression of YARS1 E196K and YARS1 153 - 156delVKQV , respectively ) ( Fig . 6a , b ) , associated with GF terminal morphological defects ( thinning of the GF terminal and constrictions , Fig . 6c ) . Remarkably , reducing the levels of Fim ( Fim Def ) restored the functioning of the YARS1 CMT ﬂ ies to control levels , while it did not perturb GF function alone or in YARS1 WT overexpressing animals ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Additionally , YARS1 153 - 156delVKQV animals with rescued GF physiology showed normal morphology of their GF axonal terminals ( Fig . 6c ) . Reciprocally , over - expression of Fim ( via A307 - Gal > Fim EP ) , which exhibited no effect in the absence of the A307 - Gal4 driver ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) , had similar detrimental effect on GF electrophysiology and morphology ( Supplementary Fig . 10c ) indicating these phenotypes can be a result of actin cytoskeletal dysruption . This effect was signi ﬁ cantly enhanced by co - expressing the YARS1 CMT mutations ( Fig . 6b ) . Thus , decreasing the actin bundler Fim rescued key electrophysiological and morphological phenotypes in the GF neurons of the Drosophila YARS1 CMT model , supporting the causal involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in YARS1 CMT etiology .

Further , we tested aspartyl - tRNA synthetase ( DARS1 ) , which is associated with a recessive neurological disorder characterized by hypomyelination , brain stem and spinal cord abnormalities , and leg spasticity 38 . In high - speed co - sedimenta - tion assays , we found that all three wild - type synthetases co - pelleted with preassembled F - actin ﬁ laments , indicating an ability to directly interact with F - actin ( Supplementary Fig . 5i , j ) . Furthermore , we took advantageof our Drosophila modelofGARS1 CMT neuropathy , where we previously demonstrated morphological , developmental , behavioral , and electrophysiological de ﬁ cits highly comparable to the YARS1 CMT model , including morphological and functional GF defects 39 . Similarly to the YARS1 CMT ﬂ ies , we were able to alleviate the GF neuronal phe - notypesupondownregulationof Fim ( Fig . 6d , e ) . Thus , modulatingthe actin cytoskeleton is a promising rescue strategy in disease models of two CMT - causing synthetases . Discussion Aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases are exemplary proteins expanding their functions over evolution through appended domains 7 . Without affecting the aminoacylation , these structural editions allow for func - tional divergence , thereby facilitating the necessary molecular com - plexity of higher organisms . By studying YARS1 - associated CMT , we unexpectedly unveiled a functionofwild - type YARS1 in F - actin binding and bundling , compatible with its canonical aminoacylation function . In this way , YARS1 is a new member of a family of over 200 known actin - binding proteins in humans that dynamically regulate the assembly and disassembly of F - actin , and its three - dimensional orga - nization . Many of these ABPs compete for binding sites on actin ﬁ la - ments , and in ﬂ uence speci ﬁ c steps in the formation , higher - order organization , and turnover of actin networks in a concentration - , localization - and time - dependent manner 40 .

Typically , established actin crosslinkers operate either as dimers ( e . g . , α - actinin ) or via tandem actin - binding domains ( e . g . , plastins ) , to bring individual actin ﬁ laments together . Interestingly , YARS1 aminoacylates tRNA as a dimeric holoenzyme 12 and thus dimerization of the synthe - tase may underlie its bundling activity . In fact , dimerization is an enriched property for CMT - linked AARSs 2 . Notably , many actin - bundling proteins have af ﬁ nity for binding actin ﬁ laments in the 1 – 10 µ M range 16 , exchanging on and off ﬁ laments on a subsecond timescale , which gives the actin cytoskeleton the plasticity for rapid recon ﬁ gurations and allows dynamic turnover of actin subunits within theindividual ﬁ lamentscomprisingthenetworks . Our ﬁ ndingssuggest thattheconcentrationatwhichYARS1bindstoF - actinisintherangeof known established bundlers and in this way the synthetase could compete with other ABPs , some of which may be the genetic and physical interactors weidenti ﬁ ed in thisstudy . This additionalintrinsic property of YARS1 may allow the enzyme to modulate local actin networks in speci ﬁ c compartments of the cell , as we demonstrate by F - actin rearrangements at the synapse , and YARS1 co - localization with F - actin in HeLa cells and patient ’ s ﬁ broblasts . The YARS1 E196K mutant exhibited stronger actin bundling in vitro and perturbed actin cytoskeleton organization in patient - derived ﬁ broblasts . Both YARS1 E196K and YARS1 G41R also disturbed the actin - based global migration and protrusion formation in SH - SY5Y - derived neuron - like cells . These ﬁ ndings support our hypothesis that CMT neuropathy is triggered by a gain - of - function mechanism and that the actin cytoskeleton is a direct target of YARS1 CMT dysfunction . Notably , allYARS1 CMT proteinsmodeledsofarshare3D - conformationalopening that exposes sequences buried within the YARS1 WT , thereby enhancing known YARS1 WT interactions 9 , 12 . While it remains to be tested experi - mentally , it is plausible that these structural perturbations lead to the hypermorphic activity we ascribe to YARS1 CMT mutants in vitro and in vivo . To better understand the relevance of the impaired actin - related function ofYARS1 CMT for neuronal pathology of CMT , weturned to our in vivo disease model . Actin has multiple established functions in neurons , related to axonal path ﬁ nding and synapse maintenance ( synaptic morphogenesis , endocytosis , vesicle mobilization , etc ) and any of these could lead to neuronal dysfunction in the long - lived neurons . As a proof of concept , we focused on synaptic vesicle mobilization , a process strongly dependent on the actin cytoskeleton 35 – 37 . We found this process to be impaired by the YARS1 CMT mutations at the Drosophila NMJ associated with local per - turbations in the actin cytoskeleton . In line with an actin bundling hypermorphic function , reducing the levels of another potent bundler like Fim restored synaptic vesicle mobility in larval NMJs , and mor - phologicaland electrophysiological defects in the adult ﬂ y GF axons in YARS1 CMT mutants . Conversely , increasing the levels of Fim induced similar functional and morphological impairments of the GFs to the ones induced by the YARS1 CMT mutants . Overall , our work suggests an actin cytoskeleton - related component in the YARS1 - induced CMT pathogenesis . Besides at synapses and axons , YARS1 CMT - associated actin cytos - keleton perturbations might potentially affect molecular processes in other subcellular compartments . The expected pleiotropic effect is in line with the existing mechanistic hypotheses about YARS1 CMT patho - genesis raised by us or others . For example , we demonstrated that upon stress conditions a fraction of YARS1 WT enters the nucleus and acts as a powerful transcriptional regulator of over 700 genes , while the CMT mutations dysregulate this function . Because of the global nature of the transcriptional effect provoked by YARS1 WT or YARS1 CMT , it isunlikely that an interaction with asingle transcriptionfactorwillbe involved . This is corroborated by our ﬁ ndings that modulating the known YARS1 interaction with the E2F1 transcription factor was CTRL YARS1 WT YARS1 E196K * * * a b Presynaptic actin ( Lifeact : : Ruby ) C T R L c d dYARS WT dYARS E196K dYARS G41R 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 M ob il e f r a c t i on o f SV Fim endo Fim down ( Fim e03298 ) * * ns * * 0 . 9 1 . 0 1 . 1 1 . 2 1 . 3 D i s t r i bu t i on o f L i f ea c t YA R S 1 E 196 K YA R S 1 W T FI Min Max p r e - b l ea c h 0 s 8 s 27 s 105 s dYARS E196K Fim e03892 ; dYARS E196K dYARS WT Fig . 5 | Characterization of YARS1 CMT - induced defects at the Drosophila larval NMJ by genetic modulation of the actin - bundling protein Fim . a Neuronal expression of YARS1 rearranges presynaptic F - actin ( Lifeact : : Ruby ) from the bou - ton border proximity ( arrows ) inwards .

Rather , the genetic or pharmacological exclusion of YARS1 CMT from the nucleus rescued the hallmark features of the pathology 9 .

YARS1 might in ﬂ uence the state of nuclear actin and related processes in different ways . Via its actin - binding and bundling function , it can potentially directly modify the organization of the nuclear micro ﬁ laments , or it can do this via interactions with other actin - binding proteins . Future developments of more sensitive molecular tools for visualization of nuclear actin that preserve its versatile organization , functions , and binding partners will enable us to test these hypotheses in the con - text of CMT . Studies in Drosophila YARS1 CMT and GARS1 CMT models established inhibition of global protein translation in ﬂ y neurons as a common feature . For GARS1 CMT ﬂ ies , the translational arrest was not due to loss of tRNA Gly aminoacylation and was not alleviated by over - expressionof the Drosophila wild - type GARS1 enzyme , suggesting a gain - of - function mechanism 42 . Furthermore , recent ﬁ ndings in Gars1 CMT and Yars1 CMT mice models revealed neuronal upregulation of the ATF4 - dependent integrated stress response ( ISR ) pathway as another commonality between both CMT - related synthetases 43 . Sequestration of tRNA Gly by GARS CMT was demonstrated to cause ribosome stalling , translational arrest , and upregulation of the ISR via the GCN2 kinase . Intriguingly , overexpression of tRNA Gly alleviated ( but not rescued ) the CMT - speci ﬁ c phenotypes in the ﬂ y model , while genetic or pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 markedly reduced the progression of the neuro - degenerative phenotypes in the Gars1 CMT mice models tested 43 , 44 . In contrast , the mechanisms behind the global translation arrest ( ﬂ y ) and the upregulated ISR ( mouse ) in YARS1 CMT models remain unknown . The ﬁ ndings of this study are in line with the triggered cellular responsesintheYARS1 CMT diseasemodels . Thetranslationalmachinery isintrinsicallyconnectedtotheactincytoskeleton 45 : F - actinisthemain cytoskeletal component that organizes spatially and temporally the translational apparatus 46 and regulates both translation and ISR 47 , while perturbations of the actin network lead to translational arrest . Also , actin dynamics tunes the ISR via eIF2a , the upstream regulator of ATF4 47 . Conversely , components of the translational machinery including polyribosomes , initiation , and elongation factors can con - tribute to actin remodeling via directly binding to actin 48 – 50 . For example , eEF1A , important for the delivery of aminoacylated tRNA to the polyribosomes , binds to and bundles F - actin independent of its role in translation 51 . eEF1A uses its actin remodeling function to switch off / on the global translation in a GCN2 - dependent manner , and in this way establishes a functional link between protein synthesis , ISR , and actin cytoskeleton 52 . Our ﬁ ndings that YARS1 performs an actin - organizing function similar to eEF1A establishes a link between the global translational arrest and the observed ISR in the Drosophila and mouse YARS1 CMT models , respectively . Altogether , it is plausible that the YARS1 CMT dysfunction is directly associated with the actin remo - deling we describe in our study , with pleiotropic effects on neuronal transcription 9 , translation 42 , and adaptation to stress 43 , collectively inducing progressive peripheral neuropathy as CMT ( Fig . 7 ) . The ﬁ ndings for YARS1 CMT are also relevant for GARS1 CMT and potentially other forms of CMT associated with defects in aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases . We provide evidence of direct binding between F - actin and glycyl - , histidyl - and aspartyl - tRNA synthetases , while the methionyl - , phenylalanyl - , and seryl - tRNA synthetases were found in complexes with actin in mammalian cells 48 – 50 . Hence , ﬁ ve out of six CMT - causing synthetases are associated with the actin cytoskeleton so far . WhilewedemonstratethatYARS1isaneffectivemodulatorofactin cytoskeleton , the impact on F - actin organization for the others remains to be delineated . In addition , we demonstrate a bene ﬁ cial effect of manipulating the actin cytoskeleton on the neurotoxicity in the GARS1 CMT Drosophila model , suggesting that , in part , the observed global translational arrest and ISR response in the ﬂ ies might be mediated by the actin cytoskeleton . In this way , we suggest a potential common mechanistic denominator among the AARSs - related CMT neuropathies . Our data complement previously published ﬁ ndings about mechanistic and structural commonalities and point out that a complex interdependence of the concentration of charged tRNA , actin organization , ISR , and the AARS ’ subcellular localization might be at thebasisofthesynthetase - inducedCMT ( Fig . 7 ) . Thisinterdependence should be tested experimentally in the future , preferably in a systematic comparative study using uni ﬁ ed disease models . The potential discovery of a shared neurotoxic signaling pathway ( s ) might facilitate the development ofdrugs for a greater number of individuals af ﬂ icted with very similar symptoms .

These are the most polarized cells in our body , and they are long - lived and particularly vulnerable to changes in their cytoskeletons over time .

Enhancer promoter lines used for the retinal screen The P ( Mae - UAS . 6 . 11 ) 23 , P ( BacWH ) 24 , P ( EP ) 2522 , and P ( EPg ) 25 enhancer - promoter lines on the X - chromosome were obtained from the Bloo - mington Drosophila stock center ( BDSC ) . The following EP lines , inserted in the direction of the Fim gene expression were screened for eye phenotypes : P ( XP ) Fim d02114 , P ( XP ) Fim d05016 , P ( XP ) Fim d03334 , P ( EP ) Fim G10929 . Inaddition , weusedthefollowingBDSClines : theFimprotein trap line P ( PTT - GC ) Fim CC01493 , UAS - Syt : : eGFP ( BDSC _ 6926 ) , UAS - Life - act : : Ruby ( BDSC _ 35545 ) , UAS - Act5C : : GFP ( BDSC _ 9258 ) , UAS - mCD8 : : RFP ( BDSC _ 32218 ) , UAS - Pod1 ( BDSC _ 8800 ) , P ( EPgy2 ) coro EY05114 ( BDSC _ 19703 ) , de ﬁ ciency line covering Fim ( Fim Def ) is BDSC _ 4741 , and the Fim XP ( BDSC _ 19171 ) and Fim e03892 stock was obtained from the Exelixis collection . UAS - RNAi lines , including the one used for IKK ε ( VDRC _ 103748 ) were from the Vienna Drosophila Research Center . The following Gal4 lines were used : GMR - Gal4 , nSyb - Gal4 , A307 - Gal4 . For the FRAP assay , nSyb - Gal4 was recombined with UAS - Syt : : eGFP on the third chromosome . The insertion sites of the EPs were determined by inverse PCR fol - lowing the protocol indicated in the Gene Disruption Project ( http : / / ﬂ ypush . imgen . bcm . tmc . edu / pscreen / ) . Unless otherwise stated , we assessed female ﬂ ies throughout the experiments . Retinal degeneration screen We chose to screen for EP lines on the Drosophila X - chromosome as a strategy to identify YARS1 CM T - relevant genetic interactions in an unbiased manner , and yet avoid a lengthy whole - genomescreening , or screening for EP lines of the much larger chromosomes 2 or 3 . The screeningwasperformedasdescribedinref . 39 . Brie ﬂ y , GMR - Gal4 ; UAS - YARS1 E196K / TM6B virgins were crossed with EP males . In case of EP male sterility or lethal EP - element insertion , crosses were repeated vice versa , using EP virgins and GMR - Gal4 ; UAS - YARS1 E196K / TM6B males . In F1 , at least 20 female ﬂ ies heterozygous for GMR - Gal > YARS1 E196K > EP and GMR - Gal4 > TM6B > EP genotypes were compared with each other . Initial positive hits were selected when rough eye phenotype was present in ﬂ ies with the ﬁ rst genotype and was absent in ﬂ ies with the second genotype , respectively . The crosses for the positive hits were repeated at least three independent times . In a next step , the initially positive hit went through a rigorous validation process , where the major criterium to be claimed as a genuine CMT modi ﬁ er was to inducearough - eyephenotypeonlyuponco - expressionwith YARS1 E196K and not with YARS1 WT . Additionally , the genetic interaction had to be evolutionary conserved ( i . e . , present both with human and Drosophila versions of YARS1 E196K ) ( see Fig . 1a for a schematicrepresentation of the screening strategy ) . Generation of UAS - Fim , UAS - PLS2 , UAS - PLS3 transgenic ﬂ ies Full - length Drosophila Fim cDNA ( clone LD05347 ) , covering the long - est ORF and over - expressing all three Fim isoforms ( A , C , and D ) , was obtained from the BDGP Drosophila Gold Collection , while PLS3 and PLS2 pCDNA3 constructs carrying the responding full length human cDNAs were kind gift from Dr . J . Gettemans ( UGent ) . Using the Gate - way® system ( Life Technologies ) , cDNA from the three constructs was sub - cloned into the pUASg . attB expression vector . The Φ C31 system was used to generate independent transgenic lines at landing sites attP40 and attP2 ( BestGene ) . Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry in HEK293 cells C - terminally FLAG - tagged human YARS1 WT was generated by transfer - ring the FLAG - TEV - ProteinA downstream of the YARS1 - containing Gateway® cassette to the Flp - in vector pCDNA5 / FRT , via Gateway® recombination ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . To identify the binding partners of YARS1 , HEK293 cells ( purchased from DSMZ , ACC 635 ) were transiently transfected with the FLAG - YARS1 vector . The immu - noprecipitation experiment was performed in triplicates . The cells were collected after 48 h of transfection and lysed in lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCL at pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % NP40 , protease inhibitor ) . The residual cell debris was removed using 20min high - speed centrifugation ( 13 , 000 rpm ) . The cell lysate was incubated for 1 h with 50 µ l Flag beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) on a rotary shaker at 4 °C . The resin was washed several times with a low salt - containing buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCL pH 7 . 4 , 100mM NaCl ) to remove the residual NP40 detergent . For identi ﬁ cation of YARS1 binding partners , on beads trypsin digestion was performed like in ref . 53 . The fraction containing theboundproteinwasreduced , alkylated , anddigestedovernightwith trypsin ( 1 / 100 trypsin / protein ratio ) . At the end , the peptide mixture was acidi ﬁ ed using formic acid . The mixture was cleaned using stage tip protocol and resulting peptides were analyzed using a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher ) . The mass spectrometry and data analysis were performed as described in ref . 54 . Brie ﬂ y , the quantitative proteomics software package MaxQuant version 1 . 5 . 3 . 8 55 was used to obtain label - free quanti ﬁ cation ( LFQ ) from the mass - spec data . The LFQ value for each protein was calculated with the MaxLFQ algorithm within 2 min retention time window using both unique and razor peptides . Gene ontology analyses For the genetic screen performed in the Drosophila CMT model , the genes potentially targeted by an EP insertion were manually curated for each EP line used in the retinal degeneration screen , either from the genotype description of the EP itself , or by a Flybase search 56 . The generated list does not exclude other potentially affected genes . The EP - targeted genes ’ annotations are based on the Flybase genome release FB2020 _ 06 . We used the PANTHER Classi ﬁ cation System , version 16 . 0 to retrieve gene ontology ( GO ) information 57 . The func - tional classi ﬁ cation of the EP - targeted ﬂ y genes and more speci ﬁ cally , their assignment to different protein classes was explored . Bioinformatic analysis Expression data and functional annotations were retrieved from Fly - Base and modENCODE . ClustalOmega was used for protein sequence Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 35908 - 3 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 999 11 alignment 58 . DroID data base was used to explore 23 predicted protein interactions in the targeted screen for genetic modi ﬁ ers ( See Supple - mentary Fig . 1e ) 26 . Characterization of Drosophila transcript levels The transcript levels of Fim in nSyb - Gal4 > UAS - Fim , nSyb - Gal4 > Fim EP as well as Fim e03892 and Fim Def ﬂ y lines , were determined upon qPCR of cDNAs from ﬂ y head extracts using standard procedures , from 2 to 3 independentexperiments , eachperformedintechnicaltriplicates . The following primers were used : 5 ′ - ACGCACAGCAAACCGGTCGA - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - CACCCATACACACTCGTTGCTGGT - 3 ′ . Scanning electron microscopy Adult ﬂ ies were terminally anesthetized with ether and directly mounted on aluminum stubs ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) without any tissue processing steps . Immediately after gold sputter coating , the eyes of the ﬂ ies were imaged using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) with an SEM505 microscope ( Philips ) . Drosophila larval immunohistochemistry and microscopy ThirdinstarlarvaeweredissectedinHL3bufferandsubsequently ﬁ xed in HL3 + 3 . 7 % PFA for 20 min . Tissue was permeabilized using 1× PBS with 0 . 2 % Triton - X and 5 % BSA . Staining was performed using the following probes / antibodies : horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , 1 : 250 ) , Disc Large 1 ( 4F3 , DHSB , 1 : 50 ) , mouse monoclonal YARS1 ( Abnova , 1 : 500 ) , rabbit polyclonal GFP ( Invitrogen , 1 : 2000 ) , rabbit polyclonal RFP ( Abcam , 1 : 250 ) , mouse monoclonal Brp ( nc82 , DHSB , 1 : 100 ) , mouse monoclonal FasII ( 1D4 , DHSB , 1 : 250 ) , mouse monoclonal Synapsin ( SynORF1 , 3C11 , DHSB , 1 : 500 ) . Alexa Fluor® − 488 and Alexa Fluor® − 546 secondary antibodies were used ( Invitrogen , 1 : 1000 ) . Muscle 6 / 7 of abdominal hemiseg - ments 3 and 4 were imaged . Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Carl Zeiss LSM700 microscope equipped with a 20× Plan - Apochromat ( 0 . 8 NA ) or 63× Plan - Apochromat ( 1 . 4 NA ) objective . Super - resolution structured illumination microscopy was performed on a Zeiss ELYRA S . 1 microscope equipped with a 63× Plan - Apochromat objective ( 1 . 4 NA ) . For a description of methods used to calculate Lifeact - RFP dis - tribution at synaptic boutons , please see Supplementary Fig . 7 . Assessment of Act5C : : GFP at boutons Female virgin ﬂ ies with the genotype nSyb - Gal4 > UAS - Act5C : : GFP were crossed to UAS - YARS1 , UAS - PLS3 , or UAS - CD8 : : RFP male ﬂ ies .

NMJs on muscle 6 / 7 on both sides of abdominal segment A3 and A4 were imaged using a Nikon Ni - E upright micro - scope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU - W1 spinning - disk head , an Andor iXon 897U EMCCD camera and Nikon Elements AR software . A 60× ( NA 1 . 4 ) oil immersion objective was used to image the NMJs . Image acquisition settings were identical for all images . Act5C : : GFP - labeled actin assemblies were assessed on maximum - intensity pro - jection images . To analyze actin in boutons , boutons were cropped , and actin assemblies were analyzed with the pipeline described below . The Trainable Weka Segmentation ( TWS ) machine - learning tool 59 in Fiji was used to manually annotate GFP - positive actin assemblies with different ﬂ uorescence intensities , and to train a classi ﬁ er that will automatically segment these structures . The segmented objects were subjectedtoHuangautothresholdingtoobtainbinarymasks . Next , we applied a Watershed processing on the binary image , to improve the isolation of individual neighboringobjects from the diffraction - limited images . We performed particle analysis on the segmented actin assemblies to obtain their number and area . Mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of individual actin assemblies was measured by applying the mask on the original image . The number of actin assemblies was nor - malized to the bouton area . To determine the bouton area using TWS , we developed different classi ﬁ er by annotating the Act5C - positive bouton ( Gaussian blur 2 ) . Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching assay at the NMJ Third instar larvae expressing eGFP - tagged synaptotagmin were dis - sected in HL3 on a Sylgard polymer block and placed in a 50 mm glass bottom imaging dish ( WillCo Wells B . V . ) . FRAP time series were acquired on an inverted Zeiss LSM700 confocal laser scanning microscope using a 63× Plan - Apochromat objective ( 1 . 4 NA ) and controlled by Zen2009 software . A 488 nm diode laser was used to image and photobleach the eGFP signal . Pre - and postbleach images ( 16 bit , 512 ×512pixels , 0 . 033 µ m / pixel ) wereacquiredevery3 . 8susing low laser power and closed pinhole ( 1 . 0 Airy units ) . For photobleach - ing , a rectangular region of interest ( ROI ; 40 ×20 pixels ) covering part of a large ( > 3 µ m ) bouton was drawn . Full laser transmission ( 100 % ) was used to bleach the ROI during 0 . 3s . The total duration of time series was 1 min 53s and consisted of two prebleach frames and 28 frames after the photobleach . To analyze the FRAP data , a purpose - built ImageJ 60 macro was used to process all FRAP series in batch . In brief , Zeiss lsm - ﬁ les wereimported using the Bioformats Java library of ImageJ and mean pixel gray values were measured in the bleach - ROI ( imported as metadata during the lsm ﬁ le import ) . These mean intensity values were normalized using the highest pre - bleach value and the lowest overall value , and the data of the resulting normalized post - bleach series was ﬁ tted to the typical exponential recovery curve using the ImageJ “ Curve Fitting ” tool ( equation used : y = a * ( 1 - exp ( b * x ) ) ) . The FRAP mobile fraction ( parameter a in the equation ) was deter - mined for every photobleached bouton . Boutons with poor curve ﬁ t - ting ( R ² < 0 . 95 ) were excluded from the data . Giant ﬁ ber electrophysiology Intracellular recordings from the tergotrochanteral muscle ( TTM ) of adult male and female ﬂ ies were obtained as previously described 9 , 15 , 61 . Brie ﬂ y , giant ﬁ bers ( GFs ) were activated with 0 . 03 ms pulses of 30 – 60V using two tungsten electrodes inserted into the brain ( Grass S44 stimulator , Grass Instruments ) . Saline - ﬁ lled glass electrodes were used for recordings from the TTM and a tungsten electrode in the abdomen served as a ground electrode . The recordingswereampli ﬁ ed ( Getting 5A ampli ﬁ er , Getting Instruments ) and the signals were stored and analyzed using pCLAMP software ( Molecular Devices ) . The abilityoftheGF toTTMpathwaytofollowhigh - frequencystimulations was assessed with ten trains of ten pulses given at 100 Hz with a 1 s interval between the trains . The average following frequencies were calculated as percent responses . Dye injections and immunohistochemistry of the giant ﬁ bers Dye injection and immunohistochemistry methods have previously been described in detail 62 , 63 . In brief , the ventral nerve cord of adult Drosophila was dissected and mounted dorsal side up on VECTA - BOND ™ ( VectorLabs ) coated0 . 9 – 1 . 1 mmetchedslides . An80 – 100M Ω glass electrode ﬁ lled with a dye solution of 10 % w / v neurobiotin ( Vector Labs ) and tetramethyl rhodamine - labeled dextran ( Invitrogen ) and back ﬁ lled with 2 M potassium acetate was used to inject the dyes into the GF axons by passing depolarizing current . Samples were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and were prepared for confocal microscopy as described previously 62 , 63 . Streptavidin - Cy2 conjugate ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ; 1 : 750 ) was used to visualize neurobiotin . Samples were scanned at a resolution of 1024× 1024 pixels , 2 . 5× zoom , and 0 . 5 μ m step size with a Nikon C1si Fast Spectral Confocal system using Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 35908 - 3 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 999 12 a 60× oil immersion objective lens . Dye ﬁ lling of the GFs with Lucifer Yellow was performed as described in ref . 15 . Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism software was used to generate graphs and to perform statistical tests throughout the manuscript . One - way ANOVA with multiple comparison test was used to analyze the data from the giant ﬁ ber system electrophysiological recordings and expression level determination in the SH - SY5Y cell lines . Two - sided unpaired t - test or Mann - Whitney U test wereused to analyze the rest of the data . All data are presented as mean± standard error of mean ( SEM ) , unless other - wise stated . Chi - square test was used to analyze data presented in graphs in Fig . 3d , e . Patient material Dermal ﬁ broblasts from one YARS1 E196K / WT patient ( male , 44 y ) and one control individual ( male , 42 y ) were sampled using standard proce - dures and after obtaining their written informed consent . The study complies with the ethical guidelines of the Medical University - So ﬁ a , Bulgaria and University of Antwerp , Belgium and was approved by the respective local institutional review boards . The biosamples are regis - tered in the Biobank Antwerp , Antwerp , Belgium ; ID : BE 71030031000 . Fibroblasts cell culture , staining procedures , and microscopy Fibroblast were grown on Y - micropatterned ﬁ bronectin - coated CYTOO plate ( CYTOO SA ) ( size 700 µ m 2 ) , using company - recommended protocol . Brie ﬂ y , standard ﬁ broblast cultures were maintained in DMEM / F12 medium ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) supple - mented with 15 % FBS . For the assay , cells of con ﬂ uent bottles were collected by gentle trypsinization and diluted to a concentration of ~ 30 , 000cells / ml . 100 µ l ( ~ 3000 cells ) were homogeneously dispensed into each well . Cells were ﬁ xed within 6 h after adhesion , using 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde . Staining procedure involved 2 washes in PBS , permeabilization using 0 . 1 % Triton X100 and staining with Alexa - Fluor TM 594 Phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) according to manu - facturer ’ s instructions . Cells were imaged using laser scanning confocal microscope Carl Zeiss LSM700 equipped with a 40× ( 1 . 3 NA ) Plan - Neo ﬂ uar objective . Voxel size : 0 . 1563× 0 . 1563 ×0 . 9474 µ m 3 . Image analysis of ﬁ broblasts ImageJ software 60 was used to assess the ﬂ uorescent intensity and distribution of the phalloidin signal using the following work ﬂ ow : images underwent background subtraction ( rolling ball radius of 10 pixels ) . The data sets for ﬁ broblasts of control individuals ( YARS1 WT ) and YARS1 E196K patients contain comparable cell numbers and have comparable ﬂ uorescent intensities . Fluorescent intensity of the Phal - loidin signal as raw integrated pixel density was measured in ImageJ , using the 32 - bit sum intensity projection ( SUM ) on a segmented cell . Segmentation was performed using Huang autothresholding > create mask > ﬁ ll holes , and the generated mask ( mask _ whole ) was used to measurethe ﬂ uorescentintensityontheSUMofanindividualcell . This maskwaserodedby12pixelsor ~ 1 . 9 µ m ( pixelsize ~ 0 . 156 µ m ) torender newmask ( mask _ 12erode ) toselecttheregion of interestexcludingthe pronounced stress ﬁ bersliningtheperiphery ofthetriangularcell . The ﬂ uorescent intensity on the periphery ( including these the stress ﬁ bers ) was measured by applying the two different ROIs ( mask _ whole and mask _ 12erode ) on the SUM , using the XOR function in the ROI manager and Measure . The data points on the graphs represent individual cells . Qualitative analyses of actin cytoskeleton in ﬁ broblasts The same data set of cells was used to score the frequency of pheno - types regarding the abundance of stress ﬁ bers , speckled actin struc - tures as well as the number of actin - rich apices . Stress ﬁ bers were present in all cells , and we scored as prominent when they resembled the three representative images in control ﬁ broblasts and the last imageoftheYARS1 E196K inFig . 3a . The ﬁ rsttworepresentativeimagesof YARS1 E196K cells would be scored as having “ some ” stress ﬁ bers as they appear interrupted ( ﬁ rst image ) and thinner ( second image ) . Actin specklesarethestructuresmarkedwithasteriskinthesecondimagein CMT ﬁ broblasts , which would be scored as having “ prominent ” speckles , the ﬁ rst images in both control and CMT cells would be scored as having “ some ” , and the second image in control cells would be scored as practically having “ none ” . First image in control cells would be scored as having “ 1 ” actin - rich apex , ﬁ rst image in CMT cells as having “ 2 ” , and the third image in mutant cells as having “ 3 ” actin - rich apices . Generation of SH - SY5Y cell lines expressing YARS1 constructs Constructs were created using the Gateway® recombination technol - ogy ( Life Technologies ) . The open reading frame of YARS1 was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR using speci ﬁ c primers to allow insertion of the pro - duct in a pcDNA5 / FRT ( Invitrogen ) vector . YARS construct was tagged atitsC - terminalendwithProtA - TEV - Flagtags . TheYARS1 CMT mutations ( p . E196K and p . G41R ) weregenerated by site - directed mutagenesis . All constructs were validated by Sanger sequencing and transferred by recombination to a pLenti6 destination vector ( Life Technologies ) . Stable cell lines were generated by lentiviral transduction of SH - SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells ( purchased from ATCC , CRL 2266 ) as described in ref . 64 . SH - SY5Y cell lines were cultured at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere in DMEM / F - 12 complete medium ( Gibco ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) . Cell migration assay in SH - SY5Y cells Cell migration was measured using the Incucyte® Cell Migration Kit ( Sartorius ) . To this end , SH - SY5Y neuroblastomacell lines were seeded in Incucyte®Imagelock 96 - well plates at 5×10 4 cells per well . The next day , at100 % con ﬂ uency , a standardizedstripof cells was scraped away in each well using the Incucyte® Woundmaker Tool ( Sartorius ) . Every well was subsequently imaged with phase contrast every hour for 80 h in the instrument . Analysis was performed using the Incucyte® Scratch Wound Analysis Software Module to segment at each time point the wound and the front of the migrating cells . The relative wound density ( area of the wound normalized to the area of the initial wound at time point zero ) is a measure for cell migration . Per plate at least 16 wells ( = 16 wounds ) wereimaged . Low - quality wounds ( irregular , occurrence of cell debris ) were removed ( < 10 % of wells ) and per plate a mean wound density was calculated per time point . Presented data is the average and SEM of ﬁ ve independent experiments ( = 96 well plates ) . ANOVA and Tukey HSD statistical testing was performed to compare the genotypes on 24h and 48 h time points . Protrusion dynamics in SH - SY5Y cells SH - SY5Yneuroblastoma celllineswere seededin 35mmdiameterIbidi µ Dishes ( Ibidi ) to a density of 4 . 5×10 5 cells per mL ( 9 ×10 5 cells per dish ) . At full con ﬂ uency and 2 - to - 4 h prior to imaging , a strip of cells was scraped away with a pipet tip to obtain a front of migrating cells . Phase contrast imaging was done on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M micro - scope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MR3 camera and a LCI Plan - Neo ﬂ uar 63× / 1 . 30 Imm Korr Ph 3 objective . Images were captured every second for 10min , resulting in 601 time frames ( 16 - bit , 1388 ×1040 pixels , 102 nm pixel dimension ) . Parameters describing the dynamics of cellular protrusions were measured using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ , similar to the analysis performed in 65 , 66 . To this end , straight line segments ( 15 µ m long ) were drawn perpendicular to the movement direction at the front of active lamellipodial protru - sions . From these lines , kymograph images were generated ( “ Multi Kymograph ” command , linewidth = 3 ) and saved . On the kymograph images , line segments were drawn covering entire individual Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 35908 - 3 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 999 13 protrusions that move forward at a constant speed ( representing lamellipodia , straight lines on kymographs ) . The displacement in the horizontal ( X ) direction is the protrusion distance ( µ m ) while the dis - placement in the vertical ( Y ) direction is the protrusion persistence ( in seconds ) . The protrusion rate ( µ m / s ) can be calculated by taking the ratio of both and is also represented by the angle of the line segment . Per genotype , we acquired at least ten image sequences , resulting in 21 – 49 kymographs and at least 185 measured individual protrusions . ANOVA and Tukey HSD statistical testing was performed to compare the genotypes . Differentiation and neurite outgrowth of SH - SY5Y cells SH - SY5Y cells were seeded 24h prior to differentiation in 24 - well plate to a density of 1 ×10 3 cells per well . Cells were differentiated in B - 27 ™ Plus neuronal culture system ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 20 µ M retinoic acid ( Merck Life Science ) , 1 % L - Glutamine ( Gibco ) , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) . Medium was refreshed every other day . Phase - contrast imaging was done on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MR3 camera and 20× phase contrast objective . Threeimagesperwellwerecapturedatday8 of differentiation . To extract the total area covered with neurites and soma in each image , we used a custom - developed ImageJ script to automatically segment both neurites and soma , using combinations of simple image operations that can i ) remove noise ( noise reduction ﬁ lters ) , ii ) separate ﬁ ne from coarse structures ( rolling ball algorithm or Fast Fourier Transform ) , iii ) separate bright from dark regions ( automatic intensity thresholding ) and iv ) exclude segmented regions based on size or shape ( morphological operations ) . The resulting segmentation masks were used to calculate the ratio of skeletonized neurites per cell body area . In addition , we manually traced individual neurite structures . To this end , images were converted to 8 - bit and analyzed with NeuronJ plugin in ImageJ , a commonly used tool for semiautomatic tracings and measurements of neurites 67 . Any projec - tion from SH - SY5Y cell body was considered a “ primary neurite ” , whereasprojectionsbranchingfromprimaryneuriteswereconsidered a “ secondary neurite ” . Three wells per genotype and three images per well were analyzed , and data from two experiments ( repetition ) was pooled , resulting in over 600 tracings in total . The overall distribution of primary and secondary neurites lengths was plotted . For each image , the fraction of secondary neurites ( over the total ) was also calculated . One - Way Anova was used for statistical analysis . YARS1 - eGFP and LifeAct - mCherry microscopy in HeLa cells HeLa cells were incubated at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in a humidi ﬁ ed atmo - sphereandmaintainedinDMEMcompletemedium ( Gibco ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) , 1 % L - Glutamine ( Gibco ) and 1 % peni - cillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) . Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent ( ThermoFisher Scien - ti ﬁ c ) . Brie ﬂ y , cells were seeded in a six - well plate the day prior to transfection in complete medium . At 70 – 80 % con ﬂ uency , cells were co - transfected with 1 µ g of the mCherry - Lifeact - 7 plasmid ( Addgene ) together with wild - type or mutant pEGFP _ YARS1 plasmid ( 1 : 1 ratio ) . The next day , cells were reseeded in 35mm glass bottom imaging dishes ( MatTek Corporation ) . Fixation ( 15min 4 % PFA , Laborimpex ) or live cell imaging was performed the next day ( 48 h after transfection ) on a Zeiss LSM700 laser scanning confocal microscopy . Fixed cells were imaged with Plan - Neo ﬂ uar 40× / 1 . 30 Oil objective . Time lapse imaging of living cells was done at 2fps with a Plan - Apochromat 63× / 1 . 40 Oil objective and using the line switching mode to avoid any ﬂ uorescence channel crosstalk and to minimize acquisitional delay between channels . ImagesinSupplementaryFig . 6 and Supplementary Movie 2 are 332 × 268 with 85nm pixel dimension . Channels were combined and movies were annotated with the Fiji distribution of ImageJ . Recombinant proteins puri ﬁ cations YARS1 protein puri ﬁ cation for actin co - sedimentation assays : Sequence veri ﬁ ed , human full - length YARS1 , encoding the wild type or the E196K substitution , was carried on a pCRT7 / NT - TOP expression plasmids carrying an Xpress TM − 6xHis tag , and used to transfect BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS E . coli competent cells , grown on LB / carbenicillin plates at 37 °C overnight . Colonies from this plate were scraped to grow a 250ml liquid preculture ( 37°C overnight ) . The preculture was thenaddedto1 lLB / carbenicillin . This1 . 25 lculturewasgrownfor ~ 4 h or to an OD 600 of 0 . 7 – 0 . 8 at 37°C . The culture was incubated on icy water for ~ 30 min , before isopropyl β - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) was added to a ﬁ nal concentration of 0 . 2mM to induce the protein expression for 4 h at 37 °C . The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10min , resuspended in ddH 2 O , snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen , and kept at − 80°C . Bacterialpellets werethawed in 1 volume of 2X lysis buffer ( 100 mM Tris , 600 mM NaCl , 40mM Imidazole , pH 7 . 5 ) , supplemented with 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol , aqueous protease inhibitor , HALT protease inhibitor and Pepstatin A , with gentile agitation at roomtemperature , followedby sonication of 4 cycles ( 30s on , 30s off , 80 % power output ) . CHAPS ( 0 . 1 % ﬁ nal concentration ) was added to the lysate before incubating for 10min on ice . The soluble supernatant and the insoluble pellet were separated by centrifugation for 10min at 12 , 000 g . The supernatant was run through PVDF syringe 0 . 22 µ m ﬁ lters before loading onto a buffer - equilibrated 1 ml HisTrap HP column ( Thermo Fisher ) . Elution was carried out in buffer con - taining 50mM Tris , 20 mM NaCl , 400mM Imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , supple - mented with 0 . 1 % CHAPS and 10 % glycerol . The fractions containing the proteins were combined , ion exchange buffer ( 20 mM Tris , 10 % glycerol , pH 8 . 5 ) was added and sample was loaded onto a Resource Q ion exchange column . The protein - containing eluates ( in 20 mM Tris , 1 MNaCl , 10 % glycerol , pH8 . 5 ) wereconcentratedto500 µ land loaded on a Superose column for a ﬁ nal step of gel ﬁ ltration in 20mM Tris , 100mM NaCl and 10 % glycerol , pH 7 . 6 . The Xpress TM − 6xHis tagged YARS1 enriched fractions were collected and concentrated , the pur - i ﬁ ed protein was aliquoted , snap - frozen and stored at − 80°C . Puri ﬁ cation of recombinant YARS1 proteins for aminoacylation assay : YARS1 WT and the YARS1 E196K mutation were cloned into pET - 20b vector ( Novagen ) . Construct were transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) cells . Cultures were grown overnight to saturation in LB medium containing 100 µ g / ml ampicilin . The overnight culture was diluted 1 / 100 in LB medium and grown at 37°C . Isopropyl ß - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) was added to a ﬁ nal concentration of 0 . 4 mM at OD600 of 0 . 7 , and then the cells were grown at 37°C for 3 h . The induced cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000rpm for 20min . The pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes ( v / w ) lysis buffer ( 20mM Tris / HCl , 300 mM NaCl , 10mM Imidazole , 1 mM phenyl - methyl - sulphonyl - ﬂ uoride , pH 8 . 0 ) . Thecellsweredisruptedbymicro ﬂ uidizer ( M - 110P ) andthelysate was clari ﬁ ed by centrifugation at 35 , 000 g for 30min . TyrRS and mutant proteins were puri ﬁ ed using Ni - NTA beads ( Qiagen ) and a HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 200 prep grade column ( GE Healthcare ) . All puri ﬁ cation steps were carried out at 4 °C or on the ice . Recombinant GST - tagged PLS3 cloning and puri ﬁ cation : For generation of GST - tagged PLS3 , the cDNA of PLS3 was cloned into PGEX4T3 vector using Not1 and Mlu1 restriction sites . For the pro - duction of GST - PLS3 recombinant protein , the bacterial cultures were grown in the presence of 50 μ g / ml Ampicillin . When the OD reached 1 . 2 , the culture was induced using 1 mM IPTG concentration for 4 h at 25°C . Next , the bacterial cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50mM Tris - HCl ( pH : 8 . 0 ) 100mM NaCl , 5mM Beta Mer - captoethanol ( BME ) , and 1 % Triton - 100 . The GST - PLS3 was puri ﬁ ed using GST beads and the fraction of bound protein was eluted using 50 mM concentration of reduced glutathione in elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH : 7 . 4 ) 100mM NaCl , 5 mM BME and 15 % glycerol .

Brie ﬂ y , C - terminal His - tagged human GARS1 WT was cloned into pET21b vector ( Novagen ) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) host cells at 25°C . The protein was puri ﬁ ed by Ni - NTA agarose af ﬁ nity column followed by ion - exchange monoQ column and size - exclusion column Superdex 200 ( GE Healthcare ) . Recombinant HARS1 and DARS1 were purchased from ProSpec Tany . Recombinant Human HARS1 ( product code ENZ - 268 ) was pro - duced in E . coli as a single , non - glycosylated , polypeptide chain having a molecular mass of 55kDa . Recombinant DARS1 ( product code ENZ - 591 ) was also produced in E . coli as a single polypeptide chain con - taining 521 amino acids , having a molecular mass of 59 . 3 kDa , and it is fused to a 20 amino acid His - tag at N - terminus . Both proteins were puri ﬁ ed by proprietary chromatographic techniques . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was puri ﬁ ed as described 69 . Fluor - escent rabbit muscle actin labeled on Cys 374 with OG maleimide ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) was generated as described 70 . In vitro binding assays Recombinant GST - tagged PLS3 ( 2 µ g ) was co - incubated with recom - binant His - YARS1 proteins ( 2 µ g ) or IgG beads ( GE Healthcare ) in PBS with 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 at pH 7 . 4 for 1 h on a rotary shaker at 4 °C . YARS1 was immunoprecipitated with YARS antibody ( H00008565 - M02 , Abnova ) . TheinputandIPfractionswereanalyzedviaWesternblotting using the YARS1 antibody and rabbit polyclonal PLS3 antibody ( ab137585 ) . Following the Dynabeads manufacturer ’ s instructions , recombinant His - YARS1 proteins were preincubated individually with GST - PLS3 or α - actinin ( Cytoskeleton ) in the presence of prewashed magnetic beads ( Dynabeads ) for 20 min at room temperature with constant agitation . The binding / washing buffer was 50 mM NaP , pH 8 . 0 , 300mM NaCl 0 , 01 % Tween - 20 . Beads were collected via magnet , the supernatant wasdiscarded , and the beads were washed four times . His - YARS1 was eluted with the low pH elution buffer ( 150mM Imida - zole , 50 mM NaP pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 0 . 01 % Tween - 20 ) and the eluate was mixed with protein sample buffer . The input and pull - down fractions were analyzed with SDS - PAGE . The gels were stained with Coomassie R250 dye - based reagent ( Pierce ) . YARS1 / PLS3 F - actin co - pelleting assay Recombinant His - tagged YARS1 proteins at three different con - centrations were co - incubated with preassembled F - actin at 2 µ M and 1 µ m GST - tagged PLS3 for 30 min , then samples were subjected to high - speed pelleting at 90 , 000 g for 1 h at 24 °C . Supernatants were carefully removed , sample buffer wasadded tosupernatant and pellet , and equal volumes of both fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie R250 dye - based reagent ( Pierce ) . Actin ﬁ lament binding - and bundling assays High - speed pelleting to determine binding to F - actin for the YARS1 recombinant proteins was performed by incubating increasing con - centrations of preassembled F - actin with 500nM YARS1 ( 30 µ l total reaction ) for30minatroomtemperature , followedby15 minpelleting at 90 , 000 g ( 4 °C ) in a TLA - 100 rotor ( Beckman ) . The entire super - natant ( ~ 30 µ l ) wasremoved to a new tube , to which 2x Laemmli Buffer was added . The pellet was dissolved by vigorous pipetting in 60 µ l Laemmli buffer . Half of the supernatant and the pellet ( 30 µ l ) were run on an SDS gel , stained with Coomassie solution , and imaged on a ChemiDoc Imaging system ( Bio - Rad ) . Images were analyzed in ImageJ , by subtracting background , and further using the Gel function in the Analyze menu . We plotted the fraction of proteins in the pellet and used GraphPad Prism to ﬁ t the data into Michaelis - Menten nonlinear curve . Low - speed pelleting to determine F - actin bundling capacity for the YARS1 proteins was performed ﬁ ve different times by incubating increasing concentrations of YARS1 with preassembled F - actin at 2 µ M concentration in a 30 µ l reaction for 30min at room temperature . The reactions were then pelleted for 15min at 14 , 000 g in a tabletop cen - trifuge precooled to 4 °C . Separation of supernatants and pellets , gel electrophoresis and staining , and image analysis were conducted identically to the high - speed pelleting assay . G - actin sequestering assay To test for putative G - actin sequestering functions of YARS1 , 16 µ M muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton TM ) in General Actin Buffer was incubated with α - actinin and BSA ( both controls at 2 µ M ﬁ nal concentration ) and 2 µ MYARS1proteinsfor30minatroomtemperature . Allproteinswere also tested alone , in the absence of G - actin . After the 30 min incuba - tion , Actin Polymerization Buffer ( Cytoskeleton TM ) was added to each tube with additional incubation at room temperature for 30 more minutes . All tubes were spun at 150 , 000 g for 1 . 5h at 24°C . Separation of supernatants and pellets , gel electrophoresis , and staining were identical to the ones described in the other pelleting assays . TIRF microscopy of F - actin ﬁ laments Coverslips ( 24 × 60 ; Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) were cleaned / etched by sonica - tion in the following solutions : 60min in detergent , 20minutes in 1 M KOH , 20min in 1 M HCl , and 60 min in ethanol . Next , the coverslips were extensively washed with ddH 2 O and dried in a stream of N 2 . A freshly prepared solution of 80 % ethanol ( pH 2 . 0 ) , 2 mg / ml methoxy - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - silane , and 2 µ g / ml biotin - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - silane ( Laysan Bio Inc . ) was applied and spread on the cleaned cover - slip ( ~ 175 µ l ) , which was further incubated for 16h at 70 °C . Flow cells were assembled before use : the coated coverslips were rinsed exten - sively with ddH 2 O , dried in an N 2 - stream and attached to a ﬂ ow chamber ( Ibidi ) with double - sided tape , and completely sealed with epoxyresinforatleast15min . Beforestartingtheimaging , the ﬂ owcell was incubated 3 min in HEK - BSA ( 20mM HEPES pH7 . 5 , 1 mM ethyle - nediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , 50 mM KCl , 1 % BSA ) , then equili - brated with 1xTIRF buffer ( 10mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 15mM glucose , 20 µ g / ml catalase , 100 µ g / ml glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % methylcellu - lose ( 4000cP , pH 7 . 5 ) ) . F - actinpolymerization wasinitiated by ﬂ owing in 2 µ M 10 % OG - labeled G - actin in TIRF buffer into the ﬂ ow chamber and monitored until ﬁ laments reached at 10 – 15 µ m length . The sam - ples were imaged brie ﬂ y before washing out free actin monomers and ﬂ owing in YARS1 or TIRF buffer alone . We recorded three proximal , nonoverlapping ﬁ elds - of - view in TIRF mode for a total time of 20min , at 0 . 1 Hz frequency . Single color , time - lapse TIRF microscopy was conducted on a Nikon - Ti200 inverted microscope equipped with a 150 mWArgonLaser ( MellotGriot , Carlsbad , CA ) , aTIRF - objectivewith NA of 1 . 49 ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , New York , NY ) and an EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon , Belfast , Northern Ireland ) , using the optimal focus via the perfect focus system . Pixel size is 0 . 178 µ m . We analyzed TIRF recordings within 15min after ﬂ ow - in of buffer or YARS1 protein . The quanti ﬁ ed data presented in Fig . 2h and Sup - plementary Fig . 5g show two representative experiments ( one at 0 . 5 µ M YARS1 and one at 2 µ M YARS1 ) in which all three samples ( YARS1 WT , mutant YARS1 E196K , and buffer alone ) were imaged from a single coated coverslip with multiple ﬂ ow chambers . These experi - ments were repeated several times and in eachcaseF - actin bundle and cable formation was induced by YARS1 ; however , there was frequent “ stickiness ” observed in the presence of YARS1 that prevented robust scoring of real - time events with TIRF . The movies were analyzed using the ImageJ software 60 , by applying the following work ﬂ ow : images underwent background subtraction ( rolling ball radius of 10 pixels ) , subsequent segmentation using Renyi ’ s entropy autothresholding , and masking the regions of interests ( ROIs ) . This segmentation approach captured single ﬁ la - ments , areas of adjacent unbundled ﬁ laments , bona ﬁ de bundles , and thick cables . Mean grayvalue was measured inthe masked ROIs , which Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 35908 - 3 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 999 15 re ﬂ ects the change of ﬂ uorescence due to “ condensation ” of the dis - persed ﬁ laments at time 0 ( the ﬂ ow - in of YARS1 ) into bundle and cables over time . The fold change of the mean gray value ( MGV ) in the segmented areas was obtained by dividing the MGV at the different time points with the MGV at time 0 ( the ﬂ ow - in of buffer in CTRL or YARS1 ) . This type of quanti ﬁ cation is presented in Fig . 2h and Sup - plementary Fig . 5g . Aminoacylation activity of YARS1 in the presence of F - actin The aminoacylation assays were performed at room temperature with 50 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 20mM KCl , 5mM MgCl2 , 4 mM ATP , 2 mM DTT , 4 µ g / mL pyrophosphatase , 20 μ M cold L - tyrosine , and 1 . 34 μ M [ 3H ] - tyrosine ( 1 mCi / mL ) as the assay solution . Total yeast tRNA ( 1 μ g / μ L ) wasmixedwiththeassaysolution , andthereactionwasinitiatedby adding YARS1 protein with or without F - actin into the mixture . At varying time intervals , 5 - μ L aliquots were applied to a MultiScreen 96 - well ﬁ lter plate ( 0 . 45 - μ m pore size hydrophobic , low - protein - binding membrane ; Millipore ) , which is prewetted with quench solution con - taining 0 . 5mg / mL DNA and 100mM EDTA in 300mMNaOAc ( pH 3 . 0 ) . Western blot analysis For protein expression level experiments on Drosophila material , we used adult ﬂ y head extracts in RIPA buffer . Protein concentration was determined using the Biorad Bradford protein assay . The following primary antibodies were used : mouse monoclonal β - actin ( 1 : 10 , 000 , Abcam ) , mouse monoclonal actin ( JLA20 , 1 : 50 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) , mouse monoclonal PLS2 ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam ab83496 ) and rabbit polyclonal PLS3 ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam ab137585 ) . HRP - labeled secondary antibodies were used ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora - tories Inc . ) . A digital 16 - bit image of the chemiluminescent signal was acquired with ImageQuant TM LAS 4000 ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . The expression levels of UAS - PLS3 and UAS - PLS2 were determined uponproteinextractionfromheadsof nSyb - Gal4 > UAS - PLS3 and nSyb - Gal4 > UAS - PLS2 ﬂ ies . Images were analyzed in ImageJ 60 , by subtracting background , and further using the Gel function in the Analyze menu . SH - SY5Y cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 50mM Tris , together with pro - tease inhibitor ) for 20min on ice and cleared by centrifugation for 10minat14 . 000rpm . Proteinconcentrationwasdeterminedusingthe Pierce BCA protein assay kit ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Cell lysates were boiled for 10min at 95°C in reducing Laemmli buffer ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 100mM 1 , 4 DTT . Proteins were separated on Bio - Rad 10 % Mini - PROTEAN® TGX ™ Precast Protein Gels ( Bio - Rad ) and transferred on nitro - cellulose membrane by semi - dry transfer on the Trans - Blot® Turbo ™ Transfer System ( Bio - Rad ) . Blockingofthemembranewasperformedusing5 % milkdilutedinPBS , supplemented with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 . Afterwards , the following primary antibodieswereused : mousemonoclonalYARS1 ( 1 : 2000 , H00008565 - M02 , Abnova ) , rabbit monoclonal Flag antibody ( 1 : 500 , F2555 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , and anti - tubulin ( 1 : 10 , 000 , ab7291 , Abcam ) . Horseradish peroxidase - labeled goat anti - mouse IgG1 ( 1 : 10 , 000 , 1070 - 05 , sanbio B . V . ) was used for chemiluminescence detection . Exposure of the membrane was performed with ECL ( 11527271 , Fish - erscienti ﬁ c ) in AI600 chemiluminescent imager ( GE Healthcare ) . Ima - ges were further analyzed and quanti ﬁ ed with ImageJ 60 . One - Way Anova statistical analysis was used to compare protein expression levels .
