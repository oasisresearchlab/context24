Copyright © 2010 American Association for Cancer Research 2 Abstract After ligand binding induces dimerization , the RET receptor tyrosine kinase activates multiple signal transduction pathways . Constitutively activating mutations and chromosomal rearrangements are the primary oncogenic event in a significant number of medullary thyroid cancers ( MTC ) and papillary thyroid cancers ( PTC ) , respectively . When specific germ - line mutations in RET are identified early , prophylactic thyroidectomy can be timed to remove at - risk tissue in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 ( MEN2 ) syndromes who would otherwise develop MTC . Conventional therapy for progressive metastatic MTC is limited . Small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors can target multiple kinases at nanomolar concentrations including RET and have shown efficacy against a variety of malignancies . Initial clinical evidence suggests that several of these including Sorafenib , Vandetanib , Motesanib , Sunitinib , and XL - 184 may have some benefit in treating progressive MTC . While initial success seen in these trials appears to be modest , this represents a major breakthrough in treatment of patients with widespread metastatic MTC .

Copyright © 2010 American Association for Cancer Research 3 Background Receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) constitute a large family of receptors which in response to their ligand activation are potent mediators of cell motility , proliferation , differentiation , and survival . Dysregulation of RTK signaling is one of the most common molecular defects associated with malignancy . The RET receptor protein was one of the first RTK found to play a role in neoplasia . The protein is encoded by the REarranged during Transfection ( RET ) proto - oncogene on chromosome 10q11 . 2 . Over 20 years ago , the gene was shown to be associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) through chromosomal rearrangements ( RET / PTC ) ( 1 ) . In 1993 - 94 , point mutations in the RET proto - oncogene were determined to be responsible for virtually all inherited medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) ( 2 , 3 ) . Furthermore , point mutations in the RET gene are found in up to 50 % of sporadic MTC . While both of these alterations lead to a gain - of - function and subsequent tumorigenesis , Hirschsprung’s disease ( loss of enteric neurons ) is associated with loss - of - function germ - line mutations . There are two significant RET isoforms from alternative splicing , resulting in different lengths of the carboxy 3’ terminal region : RET9 , RET51 . These isoforms are coexpressed in most tissues , but do not form heterodimers in vivo . The two isoforms have distinct developmental roles , and different gene expression profiles on microarray analysis suggest possible differences in downstream regulation of cell - cell interactions ( 4 ) . The RET protein is composed of three domains : an extracellular ligand binding domain , a transmembrane domain , and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain . The extracellular domain contains four cadherin - like repeats as well as a highly conserved cysteine - rich region . The cysteine - rich region is important for tertiary structure and dimerization through disulfide bond formation . The ligands of the RET receptor were identified in 1996 as growth factors belonging to the glial cell - line derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) family ( 5 - 7 ) . The GDNF - family ligands ( GFL ) include GDNF , neurturin ( NRTN ) , artemin ( ARTN ) , and persephin ( PSPN ) . RET activation requires formation of a multimeric complex with a ligand , a GDNF - family receptor - α ( GFR α ) protein , and RET ( Fig . 1 ) . GFR α are glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored co - receptors with no transmembrane or intracellular domain . Four GFR α receptors ( GFR α 1 - 4 ) have been Research . on May 30 , 2017 . © 2010 American Association for Cancer clincancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

Copyright © 2010 American Association for Cancer Research 4 identified which preferentially bind the different GFL’s . The GFL and GFR α association leads to RET dimerization to form a GFL ( 2 ) - GFR α ( 2 ) - RET ( 2 ) heterohexamer complex that results in intracellular kinase activation and signaling . GDNF and GFR α 1 knockout mice display a similar phenotype to RET knockout mice , namely lack of enteric neurons and kidney agenesis . NRTN and GFR α 2 knockout mice lack parasympathetic cholinergic innervation in the salivary glands . ARTN and GFR α 3 knockout mice have a reduction or lack the superior cervical ganglion . PSPN and GFR α 4 knockout mice demonstrate hypersensitive cerebral ischemia and decreased calcitonin secretion respectively ( 8 ) . Lipid - rafts on the plasma membrane have also been shown to be important for RET signal transduction and likely interact with the activating complex in two different ways . GFR α receptors are typically located in lipid rafts , and after ligand binding recruit RET into the raft where it dimerizes and interacts with specific docking proteins which activate signal pathways . Phosphorylated RET can then move away from the lipid rafts where it can associate with different docking proteins and is possibly degraded or internalized . Alternatively , GFR α may be cleaved from the plasma membrane to produce a soluble form , which may interact with GFL before associating with RET which then is recruited to the lipid - raft . RET protein dimerization results in autophosphorylation of several intracellular RET tyrosine residues . There are 10 autophosphorylation sites found on both major RET isoforms ( RET9 and RET51 ) , and an additional two found on the longer isoform , RET51 . Several are binding sites for a variety of docking proteins . The tyrosine ( Y ) Y1062 has been shown to bind SHC ( Src - homology collagen ) , IRS1 / 2 ( insulin receptor substrate1 / 2 ) , FRS2 ( fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 ) , and PKC α ( protein kinase C α ) . These are able to activate multiple signaling pathways , including MAPKinase ( mitogen activated protein kinase ) , PI - 3K ( phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase ) / AKT , RAS / ERK , and Rac / JNK . These pathways are mediators of cell motility , proliferation , differentiation , and survival . DOK 1 / 4 / 5 / 6 ( downstream of kinase 1 / 4 / 5 / 6 ) also binds phosphorylated Y1062 , and DOK4 binding has been implicated in GDNF - dependent outgrowth . Binding of c - Src or SH - 2B β to phosphorylated Y981 promotes survival and differentiation . Other binding sites as well have been shown to be Research . on May 30 , 2017 . © 2010 American Association for Cancer clincancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

SHC preferentially binds to activated RET outside lipid - rafts , while FRS2 ( FGF receptor substrate 2 ) preferentially binds when RET is within the raft . FRS2 activates ERK through both Grb2 and Shp2 . Phenotype - Genotype Correlation in Medullary Thyroid Cancer MTC arises from the calcitonin - producing thyroid C cells . One quarter of all MTC arise in an inherited form from point mutations in the RET proto - oncogene . These familial syndromes include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A ( MEN2A ) , type 2B ( MEN2B ) , and familial MTC ( FMTC ) , in which the penetrance of developing MTC is virtually 100 % . The RET gene mutations have a high phenotype - genotype correlation , corresponding with MTC behavior and directly affecting treatment and surveillance . Generally , the least aggressive tumors arise in FMTC , which is characterized by only the development of MTC without other abnormalities . MEN2A tumors are slightly more aggressive , and patients may develop pheochromocytomas , parathyroid hyperplasia , and rarely cutaneous lichen amyloidosis . MEN2B tumors are the most aggressive , and the syndrome is characterized by pheochromocytomas , skeletal abnormalities , mucosal neuromas , and a Marfanoid habitus but not parathyroid hyperplasia . Presently , there are 500 - 1000 MEN2 kindreds recognized worldwide ( 9 ) . RET mutations in MEN 2A kindreds fall predominantly into one of six cysteine residues in the extracellular domain ( codons 609 , 611 , 618 , 620 , 630 , and 634 ) . Of these , mutations in codon 634 account for approximately 85 % . These cysteine residues are essential for the protein tertiary structure , as they form intramolecular disulfide bonds . When one of these six cysteines is mutated , then an unpaired cysteine is left , which is believed to be able to form a disulfide bond with another similar RET protein , resulting in dimerization and activation without ligand stimulation . There are also rare reports of kindreds with a short 9 or 12 base pair insertion disrupting a cysteine residue , again resulting in an unpaired cysteine available for dimerization . Rare MEN2A mutations exist in non - cysteine codons , including 533 , 790 , 791 , 804 , and 891 . The last four mutations occur in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain . The penetrance of hyperparathyroidism in MEN2A is about 20 % and is more commonly associated with codon 634 mutations . Pheochromocytomas , seen in approximately 50 % of patients , are Research . on May 30 , 2017 . © 2010 American Association for Cancer clincancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

Cutaneous lichen amyloidosis also has rarely been reported with MEN2A and has only been described associated with codon 634 . Surprisingly , MEN2A kindreds can also demonstrate a Hirschsprung’s phenotype ( typically associated with a loss of function mutation ) , which has only been associated with codon 609 , 611 , 618 , and 620 mutations . One explanation for this paradox is that in combination with this activating RET mutation there are multiple mutations affecting the RET gene or the upstream regulatory elements that occur within a specific haplotype ( 10 ) . FMTC kindreds have germline mutations which overlap MEN2A mutations , but also include mutations from additional codons including 768 , 844 , and 912 . RET mutations in MEN2B kindreds fall almost entirely at codon 918 ( 95 % ) , but a few families have a codon 833 mutation . These mutations occur in the catalytic region of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain , enabling activation without the need for ligand stimulation or RET dimerization . Several studies have suggested differences in substrate specificity between MEN2A and 2B activated proteins . MEN2B - mutated RET has a higher upregulation of PI - 3K / AKT and JNK phosphorylation . A difference in the pattern of RET autophosphorylation sites has also been demonstrated . Several other rare MEN2B mutations have a mutation in codon 804 with a simultaneous mutation in codons 805 , 806 , or 904 . The only other malignancy besides thyroid where mutations in RET clearly contribute to malignancy is pheochromocytoma . Sporadic pheochromocytomas were found to contain a somatic , heterogenous 918 mutation in 15 % of examined cases ( 11 ) . Initially , it was reported that two small cell lung cancers had RET mutations , but this was not corroborated in larger studies . Mutations have not been detected in other neuroendocrine tumors , including neuroblastomas , which expresses wild type RET . Recently , there has been evidence that some pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas contain a RET polymorphism . In a study of 52 primary tumors , the allelic frequency of a G619S polymorphism was 20 % , while in matched normal pancreas the frequency was 15 % ( 12 ) . The G619S polymorphism may enhance GDNF receptor mediated cell proliferation and invasion , but a clear role in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis has yet to be demonstrated .

Copyright © 2010 American Association for Cancer Research 7 Clinical - Translational Advances Genetic Determination of Surgical Timing The optimal treatment for MTC in patients with MEN2 is prophylactic thyroidectomy , ideally just prior to extra - thyroidal spread . Since there is a good correlation between MTC clinical aggressiveness and the specific RET genotype , the timing of surgical intervention varies depending on the specific mutation . The American Thyroid Association has recently refined the categorization of all known mutations into four levels to recommend an age for prophylactic surgery ( 13 ) . Patients with the highest risk are in level D with mutations in codons corresponding to MEN2B , and should have surgery by age 6 months . Level C consists of mutations in codon 634 and should have prophylactic surgery before age 5 . Level B consists of mutations in codons 609 , 611 , 618 , 620 , and 630 . Surgery should be considered before age 5 , but may be delayed if stringent criteria are met ( normal serum calcitonin , normal neck ultrasound , and less aggressive family MTC history ) . Level A mutations are characterized by MTC with the least aggressive behavior and surgery may be delayed after age 5 based on stringent criteria previous described and the clinicians discretion . Targeted Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Over the past decade has come the development of small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , which typically affect multiple signaling pathways . Currently , an inhibitor specific only for RET is not available , but several multi - kinase inhibitors have significant activity against RET . Several have demonstrated inhibition of RET kinase and tumor growth in pre - clinical models of MTC . Vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) was originally developed as a second generation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) TKI but subsequently was found to have more potent inhibitory effects against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) ( IC 50 = 40 nM ) and RET ( IC 50 = 130 nM ) than EGFR ( IC 50 = 500 nM ) ( 14 ) . Vandetanib blocks autophosphorylation of codon 918 mutant RET kinase in intact cells ( 15 ) . Certain mutations in RET codons 804 and 806 have been shown to confer resistance to vandetanib , which may be a concern for secondary resistance to the drug ( 16 , 17 ) . Sorafenib ( BAY 43 - 9006 ) is another multi - Research . on May 30 , 2017 . © 2010 American Association for Cancer clincancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

Copyright © 2010 American Association for Cancer Research 8 kinase inhibitor targeting RET , as well as BRAF , VEGFR , and platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) . In vitro , sorafenib inhibits oncogenic RET kinase with an IC 50 of < 50 nM and decreased tumor volume of TT cells ( MTC cell line harboring a codon 634 RET mutation ) in athymic mice ( 18 ) . Phase I and II clinical trials of at least 15 patients evaluating efficacy of RET TKI’s in patients with metastatic MTC are summarized in Table 1 . The phase II trial of vandetanib was conducted exclusively in patients with hereditary MTC ( 19 ) . While it demonstrated dramatic suppression of serum calcitonin and CEA in 80 % of patients , partial responses induced were modest ( 20 % ) . Responses did not correlate with 618 , 620 , 634 or 918 codon mutations in RET . The phase II trials for motesanib and sorafenib included patients with sporadic as well as hereditary MTC ( 20 , 21 ) . Although these trials included mostly sporadic MTC , somatic mutations in RET were present in 70 - 80 % of tumors tested ; and of these , greater than 80 % were at codon 918 . As indicated in Table 1 , partial responses with motesanib and sorafenib were minimal ( 2 - 6 % ) and overall responses were modest at best . Finally , data for sunitinib and XL - 184 are preliminary but reveal modest partial responses ( 29 - 33 % ) and tumor marker responses ( 22 - 24 ) . Like the sorafenib and motesanib trials , the RET mutation rate in sporadic tumors was also high ( 65 - 78 % ) with predominantly codon 918 mutations . Based on encouraging response and safety data found in early phase clinical trials in MTC , an international multicenter double blind randomized phase III clinical trial in MTC ( hereditary and sporadic combined ) with vandetanib has been conducted while another with XL - 184 is ongoing . While both trials use placebo as a control group with 2 : 1 randomization , unblinding and cross over at time of disease progression was allowed in the vandetanib trial but not in XL - 184 . The primary endpoint is progression free survival ( PFS ) in the vandetanib trial while overall survival is used in the XL - 184 trial . Preliminary results of phase III trial of vandetanib were reported after 24 months of median duration of follow up ( 25 ) . A total of 331 patients were enrolled from December 2006 - November 2007 , with 231 patients assigned to receive oral vandetanib at a dose of 300 mg daily on an ongoing basis while 100 patients were assigned to receive placebo . Median progression free survival for the placebo group was 19 . 3 months while it has not been reached for vandetanib group . The hazard ratio for progression free survival is 0 . 46 Research . on May 30 , 2017 . © 2010 American Association for Cancer clincancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Author manuscripts have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication but have not yet been edited .

This is the first phase III trial in sporadic and hereditary MTC showing benefit of RET - targeted TKI in delaying disease progression . However , overall survival data is immature . Common grade 1 - 2 ( mild - moderate ) adverse events such as fatigue , weight loss , diarrhea , mucositis , hand foot syndrome , hypertension are observed with TKI therapies and can adversely affect quality of life . Furthermore , grade 3 - 4 ( severe and life threatening ) side effects such as bowel perforation , thrombosis / bleeding are uncommon but do occur . In summary , trials of vandetanib , motesanib , sorafenib , sunitinib and XL - 184 seem to be within an appropriate dose and in an appropriate patient population for targeting RET kinase inhibition . All of these kinase inhibitors except imatinib exhibit very low IC 50 ( 4 - 130 nM ) for RET kinase that is easily achievable in patients’ plasma with standard oral doses of these drugs . While trials of motesanib , sorafenib , sunitinib and XL - 184 did not require a positive RET mutation as entry criteria , the sporadic MTCs in these trials were enriched for RET mutation tumors . Although direct comparisons between these trials cannot be made , a few observations can . Responses are observed across these trials but response rates are variable which may relate to differences in tumor biology , host or drug characteristics . One or more of the following factors may explain the failure to achieve higher and durable responses despite using an appropriate drug and patient population in these trials : 1 ) degree of tumor burden and pace of progression , 2 ) frequency of codon 918 RET mutation ( associated with aggressive clinical course ) , 3 ) pharmacogenomics , 4 ) potency and duration of RET kinase inhibition by kinase inhibitor , 5 ) target profile of multi - kinase inhibitor , and 6 ) drug tolerability impacting dose adjustment and drug holidays . In order to optimize response rates and toxicity profiles , actual targets and mechanism of action as well as mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance need clarification . Presently , it is unknown if observed responses are related to RET kinase inhibition , other kinases inhibited by these drugs , or a combination of both . VEGFRs inhibition may play a critical role in inducing responses by such multi - kinase inhibitors .

Copyright © 2010 American Association for Cancer Research 10 Overall success seen in these trials represents a major breakthrough in treatment of patients with widespread metastatic MTC . However , current clinical trials of RET - targeted therapies are only the first step in discovering effective therapies for patients with MTC . Further progress in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of MTC is critical to elucidate : 1 ) role of RET kinase signaling pathway in tumor progression and maintenance , 2 ) other critical targets or signaling pathways important in MTC , 3 ) mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to TKIs by potential redundant signaling pathways or by developing ‘resistance’ mutations in RET . Combination or sequential targeted therapies based on strong pre - clinical data of inhibition of parallel or different signaling pathways may improve effectiveness . In addition , refining toxicity profile of targeted therapies is also a critical goal . Improving success rates of targeted therapies for MTC are realistic goals for near future in field of MTC .
