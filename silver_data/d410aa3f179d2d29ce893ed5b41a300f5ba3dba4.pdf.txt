Hence , new principles must in these cases be invoked to account for the mechanical force driving membrane shape changes . Here we show that the Gb3 ( glycolipid ) - binding B - subunit of bacterial Shiga toxin induces narrow tubular membrane invaginations in human and mouse cells and model membranes . In cells , tubule occurrence increases on energy depletion and inhibition of dynamin or actin functions . Our data thus demonstrate that active cellular processes are needed for tubule scission rather than tubule formation . We conclude that the B - subunit induces lipid reorganization that favours negative membrane curvature , which drives the formation of inward membrane tubules . Our findings support a model in which the lateral growth of B - subunit – Gb3 microdomains is limited by the invagination process , which itself is regulated by membrane tension . The physical principles underlying this basic cargo - induced membrane uptake may also be relevant to other internalization processes , creating a rationale for conceptualizing the perplexing diversity of endocytic routes . Several endocytic routes do not involve clathrin - coated pits 1 – 6 , and the mechanisms that initiate membrane uptake in these cases are still largely unknown . The bacterial Shiga toxin is one of the cargoes that are endocytosed independently of clathrin 7 – 9 . Intoxication of cells by this pathogenic product requires its binding to the glycosphingolipid receptor globotriaosyl ceramide ( Gb3 ) in the exoplasmic membrane leaflet . Tostudy one of theearliest steps of toxin uptake into cells , that is , the formation of membrane invaginations , we have applied vari - ous microscopy approaches to monitor dynamic membrane shape changes . STxB uptake via tubular membrane invaginations First , we analysed the localization in human HeLa cells of the non - toxic homopentameric Gb3 - binding B - subunit of Shiga toxin ( STxB ) . At early times of STxB internalization ( 5 min ) , tubular STxB - positive structures of variable length could be detected ( Fig . 1a ) , of which some were clearly connected to the surface in the focal plane of observation ( arrow ) . These tubules did not contain the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , which is internalized via clathrin - coated pits . Dynamin has been ascribed a critical role in membrane scission in many , but not all , endocytic pathways 2 , 10 . Inhibiting dynamin func - tion by overexpression of the dominant - negative dynamin protein Dyn2baK44A ( Fig . 1b ) , or with dynasore—a small - molecule dyna - min inhibitor 11 , or by short interfering ( si ) RNA - mediated depletion of the protein ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) resulted in all cases in the increased occurrence of long surface - connected STxB - containing tubules , suggesting that their scission was inhibited under these con - ditions . Dyn2baK44A ( Fig . 1b ) , but not TfR ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , localized to STxB - containing tubules . To bypass fixation or shifts in temperature—conditions that may affect tubule integrity—images were acquired on live cells at 37 u C . Again , STxB appeared in surface - connected tubules when dynamin function was inhibited ( Fig . 1c ) , even at time points when STxB was almost exclusively in perinuclear Golgi membranes of control cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The find - ing that dynasore partially protected cells from Shiga - toxin - induced protein biosynthesis inhibition ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) confirmed that a sizable fraction of toxin traffics through dynamin - dependent pathways , differentiating this uptake from the CLIC / GEEC 12 , 13 and flotillin 14 routes . Recently , strong evidence for a functional link between dynamin and actin in membrane scission has been pre - sented 15 . Incubation of cells with latrunculin A , a small - molecule compound that inhibits actin polymerization , increased the occur - rence of STxB - induced invaginations ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , sug - gesting that actin is required for their efficient scission . Incubation of energy - depleted cells , in which molecular motors and other mechanoenzymes , including dynamin , are inactive , with STxB concentrations as low as 1 nM also led to the formation of tubules that were negative for TfR and clathrin ( Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) . Tubules were more frequently observed in energy - depleted cells than in control cells , probably because dynamin was unable to process them , despite being localized on them ( Fig . 1d ) . Immunogold labelling on cryosections of energy - depleted cells clearly confirmed that invaginations were surface - connected ( Fig . 1e , and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Furthermore , the dynamic growth of surface - connected tubules could be imaged on energy - depleted live cells ( Fig . 1f , Supplementary Fig . 6d , e ; and Supplementary Movies 1 – 3 ) . Cholesterol extraction , which has been described to affect cell entry of STxB 16 , also resulted in the accumulation of surface - connected tubules ( Fig . 1g ) , the length of which was 1 Institut Curie , Centre de Recherche , Laboratoire Trafic , Signalisation et Ciblage Intracellulaires , 2 Laboratoire Physico - Chimie , 3 Laboratoire Structure et Compartiments Membranaires , 4 Laboratoire Chimie Organique ( Vectorisation ) , 26 rue d’Ulm , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 5 CNRS UMR144 , 6 Universite´ P . et M .

How cholesterol functions in membrane scission remains to be deter - mined , but resistance to detergent extraction indicated that tubular STxB was in a raft - like lipid environment ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . In summary , in different experimental conditions that all affect STxB entry into cells , STxB was localized in surface - connected tubules , strongly suggesting that these are intermediates of STxB uptake . This was directly demonstrated with evanescent field fluor - escence microscopy : the reversion of energy depletion by washout led to the scission of STxB - containing tubules ( Fig . 1i , and Supplemen - tary Movie 4 ) . STxB induces tubular membrane invaginations The presence of tubules in energy - depleted cells points to the pos - sibility that STxB itself induces these structures . The following experiment was performed to test this hypothesis .

NATURE | Vol 450 | 29 November 2007 ARTICLES 671 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup its presence ( STxB binding , Fig . 2a ) revealed that no membrane invaginations could be detected under these conditions . Only when STxB was present during incubations at 37 u C could FM4 - 64 be found in invaginations ( Fig . 2b ) . We conclude that STxB did not diffuse into preexisting invaginations , but induced them . The specificity of the tubulation process was tested in two ways . First , we generated an STxB variant in which the Gb3 binding site III was inactivated by mutagenesis . The binding capacity of the W34A mutant is only reduced fourfold with an unchanged K d , whereas a two - log reduction in cytotoxicity has been described in Vero cells 17 . Even when used at high concentrations that ensured efficient binding to cells , the W34A mutant was only rarely found in tubules ( Fig . 2c ) . Second , energy - depleted cells were incubated with a monoclonal IgM antibody against the cellular Shiga toxin receptor , Gb3 . The antibody bound to cells , but even after cross - linking with secondary antibod - ies , no membrane invaginations could be detected ( Fig . 2d ) . These two observations demonstrated that binding to cells alone is not sufficient to induce membrane deformation . Caveolins are peripheral membrane proteins that have been impli - cated in clathrin - independent endocytosis , including that of cholera toxin 18 . We found here that caveolin 1 was absent from STxB - induced invaginations ( Fig . 2e ) , and that these could form on two caveolin - free cell systems : energy - depleted human huh7 cells ( Fig . 2f ) and fibroblasts from caveolin 1 knockout mice ( Fig . 2g ) . These results established that caveolin 1 was not required for the formation of toxin - induced invaginations . Membrane invaginations on model membranes The cell experiments strongly indicated that STxB could induce membrane invaginations even when the cellular membrane deforma - tion machinery was inhibited . To study whether STxB induces inva - ginations in the total absence of cellular proteins and to analyse the physical and biochemical conditions of tubule formation in a con - trolled manner , the process was reconstituted in a minimal system . Cytosol - free giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ; typical diameters of 10 – 30 m m ) composed of 1 , 2 - dioleoylphosphatidyl choline ( DOPC ; 64 mol % ; spiked with 1 % Bodipy FL - C 5 - HPC , green ) , cholesterol ( 30 mol % ) , and purified porcine Gb3 ( 5 mol % ) were observed by fluor - escence microscopy on incubation with fluorophore - labelled STxB . After addition , STxB ( red ) bound within seconds to GUVs and was initially uniformly distributed ( Fig . 3a , top panel , andSupplementary Movie 5 ) . Spots of intense STxB labelling subsequently became apparent on the same GUV ( Fig . 3a , middle panel , arrows ) . A decrease in membrane tension owing to GUV surface increase on Bodipy FL - C 5 - HPC photoactivation ( J . Solon , personal communica - tion ) resulted within 1 min in the formation of tubular membrane invaginations ( Fig . 3a , bottom panel ) . Similar observations were made when membrane tension was decreased by increasing the osmotic pressure of the bath .

Tubules often had spiral morphology ( Fig . 3a , bottom panel ; arrow ) , and longer ones formed supercoiled structures ( arrowhead ) . These different shapes were easily identified by time - resolved imaging of confocal sections at the medial plane of the GUVs ( Fig . 3b , and Supplementary Movie 6 ) , or by three - dimensional reconstruction of spinning disk confocal microscopy images ( Supplementary Movie 7 ) . In the absence of STxB ( Supplementary Movie 8 ) or Gb3 ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) , no invaginations could be detected on flaccid GUVs . The W34A mutant ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Movie 9 ) and cross - linked antibodies against Gb3 ( Fig . 3d ) failed to induce tubular invaginations on flaccid GUVs , despite efficient binding to GUV membranes , mirroring the findings in energy - depleted cells ( Fig . 2c , d ) , and suggesting that the invagination process requires specific structural conditions that are not met in the Gb3 – antibody complex . To study the relationship between the structure of the STxB – Gb3 complex and its function in membrane invagination , we obtained defined molecular Gb3 species by chemical synthesis ( see Methods ) . On GUVs containing Gb3 with a C22 : 1 ( D 13 ) single unsaturated acyl chain in cis - geometry , tubule formation could readily be observed ( Fig . 3e , and Supplementary Movie 10 ) . In contrast , no tubules were formedwhenGb3wasmadewithasaturated C22 : 0acylchain ( Fig . 3f , and Supplementary Movie 11 ) or lyso Gb3 ( lacking one acyl chain ; not shown ) , despite efficient STxB binding to these GUVs . Our observations so far , and further evidence presented below , suggest that two concomitant , and probably related processes con - tribute to the formation of STxB - enriched membrane tubules , namely the coupling of STxB to a change of local membrane curv - ature ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) and the formation of high - density clusters of STxB – Gb3 complexes ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . The curv - ature question will be considered first . Several mechanisms—protein scaffolding , helix insertion , lipid composition and membrane protein shape—have been described to account for membrane curvature in biological systems ( summar - ized in refs 19 – 21 ) . Considering that STxB lacks intrinsic curv - ature 22 , 23 , and that glycosphingolipids have large polar head groups that are not expected to adopt negative membrane curvature 24 , it seems unlikely that any of these mechanisms apply to the STxB – Gb3 system . In contrast , we propose that it is the specific organiza - tion of STxB – Gb3 complexes that imposes a preferred negative curvature to the membrane . STxB—which can bind up to 15 Gb3 molecules per pentamer 25 —may locally create an asymmetric com - pressive stress in the external leaflet of the lipid bilayer , which leads to membrane bending towards the protein ( see schematic representa - tion in Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . The findings that unsaturated Gb3 species with voluminous lipid tails induce membrane invaginations ( Fig . 3e ) , whereas saturated Gb3 species ( Fig . 3f ) or the binding - site mutant W34A ( Fig . 2c and 3c ) have a strongly reduced propensity to do so , are strong arguments in favour of this hypothesis . STxB clustering on cell and model membranes The above - mentioned curvature effect may result in large - scale membrane invaginations only if STxB forms high - density clusters and if the membrane tension is sufficiently low 26 ( see Supplemen - tary Fig . 12 ) . In agreement with this prediction , spots of intense STxB labelling were frequently observed at invagination sites before tubule growth ( Fig . 3a , and Supplementary Movies 5 and 10 ) . When mem - brane invagination was prevented by keeping GUVs under high tension , STxB clusters reached micrometre scales ( Fig . 4a , and Supplementary Fig . 13 ) , suggesting that : ( 1 ) STxB clustering is inde - pendent of macroscopic membrane deformation , and ( 2 ) the lateral extension of STxB domains is limited by the invagination process . No STxB clusters formed on incubation of the W34A mutant with GUVs made with standard porcine Gb3 , or on incubation of wild - type STxB with GUVs made with C22 : 0 Gb3 species ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . As described above ( Figs 2c and 3c , f ) , the formation of membrane invaginations was also inhibited under these conditions , confirming that the invagination and clustering processes are related . Atomic force microscopy on solid supported lipid bilayers was used to obtain high - resolution information on cluster structure . Protein clusters formed on the addition of STxB to membranes com - posed of DOPC , cholesterol and Gb3 ( Fig . 4b ) . These structures were not detected in theabsence of STxB ( Fig . 4c ) or Gb3 ( notshown ) . The difference in height between protein - free and protein - covered mem - brane , as determined from contact mode images , was 2 . 3 nm ( 6 0 . 4 nm , n 5 27 ) , which represents a 15 % increase over the 2 nm height that was reported from the crystal structure of STxB 22 , 27 .

NATURE | Vol 450 | 29 November 2007 ARTICLES 673 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup owing to higher lipid density , and is consistent with the view that STxB exerts a compressive stress on the outer - membrane leaflet , ultimately leading to the invagination of free membranes . Furthermore , thickness mismatch provides a driving force for the formation of protein - rich lipid domains 28 ( see below ) . STxB clusters seem to be smaller on supported bilayers than on GUVs , which is in agreement with a recent report on the influence of solid substrate interactions on domain size 29 . The effect of STxB clustering on cell membrane order was analysed by two - photon laser - scanning microscopy in conjunction with the polarization - sensitive membrane dye Laurdan 30 . Membrane order is characterized by generalized polarization values ranging from 2 1 to 1 1 with condensed domains typically between 0 . 3 – 0 . 55 ( ref . 31 ) . Membrane reorganization was observed in energy - depleted cells . After binding to cells on ice and during tube formation upon a shift to 37 u C , STxB co - localized predominantly with ordered domains of high generalized polarization values ( Fig . 4d ) . Membrane ordering was significantly more pronounced at early time points , concomitant with tubule formation ( Fig . 4e , 0 versus 5 min ) . Analysis of global generalized polarization distribution revealed that the abundance of ordered domains was increased by STxB in all conditions , and that this effect was again strongest at early time points after a temperature shift to 37 u C ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that membrane ordering takes place on STxB binding , and peaks at the time of formation of invaginations . The W34A mutant— which has a strongly reduced propensity to induce invaginations in cells ( Fig . 2c ) and model membranes ( Fig . 3c ) —did not increase membrane order ( Fig . 4f ) , consistent with its reduced clustering capacity ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . In contrast , even after cholesterol extraction , generalized polarization values at wild - type STxB domains were high and increased during a temperature shift to 37 u C ( Fig . 4g ) , in line with the formation of invaginations under these conditions ( Fig . 1g , h ) . The formation of STxB clusters is associated with the existence of a line energy between the STxB – Gb3 complexes and the surrounding membrane ( see schematic representation in Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Line energy occurs at interfaces between membrane regions with different physical properties and may stem from higher lipid order , as suggested by our Laurdan studies ( Fig . 4d , e ) , and increased mem - brane thickness in the vicinity of STxB , as deduced by atomic force microscopy ( Fig . 4b ) . Line energy alone can only explain membrane deformations in the micrometre size range 32 – 34 , and must be coupled to additional factors , such as the bending effects described above , to account for the high membrane curvatures that are typical for cellular membrane invaginations . Our finding that STxB domain formation is sensitive to steric constraints within the lipid tails under STxB pentamers , owing to variation of acyl chain number ( W34A mutant ) or saturation ( C22 : 0 Gb3 species ) ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) , provides strong experimental evidence for a model according to which curv - ature - mediated interactions between STxB – Gb3 complexes could favour clustering 35 , 36 ( see schematic representation in Supplemen - tary Fig . 12 ) . The observation that STxB - induced tubules have spiral morphologies ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Movies 6 , 7 ) further suggests that STxB – Gb3 complexes also impose chiral properties on the membrane , which constitutes another driving force for sub - micrometre membrane invagination 37 – 39 . Both mechanisms may function in concert in the STxB - induced invagination process . Collectively , the findings reported here demonstrate the capacity of STxB to induce membrane invaginations on cell and model mem - branes . When STxB binds with high affinity to its glycolipid receptor Gb3 , its membrane - ordering capacity leads to the dynamic forma - tion of STxB – Gb3 cluster domains with an intrinsic propensity to impose negative curvature on the membrane . The lateral growth of these STxB – Gb3 cluster domains seems to be regulated by the inva - gination process , as recently proposed for membrane rafts 40 . Narrow invaginations can form from these domains without the help of the cellular protein machinery . This cargo - induced mechanism may also apply to other extracellular pathogens , such as viruses , and more generally to other types of endocytosis events , although the factors implicated in the formation of two - dimensional membrane micro - domains may differ in different contexts . Processing machineries would be recruited onto the invaginations to influence the dynamics and shapes of the forming transport intermediates . METHODS SUMMARY Immunofluorescence studies 41 and evanescent - field microscopy 42 were carried out as described . Cells were fixed at 37 u C to maintain tubule integrity . Cellular energy was depleted by incubating HeLa cells in PBS 11 supplemented with 10 mM 2 - deoxy - D - glucose and 10 mM NaN 3 for 30 min at 37 u C . Residual ATP levels were 2 . 1 % ( 6 0 . 46 % , n 5 3 ) under energy block conditions , similar to a previous report 43 . Dynasore was used at 20 - 80 m M 11 . Dyn2baK44A plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells for 16 h . Cholesterol was extracted using 10 mM methyl - b - cyclodextrin for 30 min 16 . GUVs were grown using the electroforma - tion technique 44 . Supported lipid bilayers were prepared as described 45 , but at a temperature of 50 u C . Membrane order of STxB - enriched membranes was ana - lysed with the membrane dye Laurdan 30 .

Anti - CTR433 antibody was provided by M . Bornens . STxB was purified as previously described 41 . The W34A mutant was constructed by site - directed mutagenesis , as described 41 . Cell culture and transfection . Dyn2baK44A plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells by electroporation . Cells were used 16h after transfection . Dynasore was used at 20 – 80 m M , as described 11 . siRNA against dynamin 2 ( GGA CAU GAU CCU GCA GUUdTdT ) was from Proligo and was transfected according to the manufacturer’s instructions with Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) for 72h . Depletion of cellular energy and cholesterol . Cellular energy was depleted by incubating HeLa cells in PBS 11 supplemented with 10mM 2 - deoxy - D - glucose and 10mM NaN 3 for 30min at 37 u C . Residual ATP levels were 2 . 1 % ( 6 0 . 46 % , n 5 3 ) under energy - block conditions , similar to a previous report 43 . The treatment was reversible in that energy - depleted cells resumed growth after removal of the energy block . Control cells were incubated with PBS 11 , supple - mented with 5mM glucose . Cholesterol was extracted using 10mM methyl - b - cyclodextrin for 30min , as described 16 . Wide - field , confocal and evanescent - field microscopy . Immunofluorescence studies were carried out , as previously described 41 . Cells were fixed at 37 u C to maintaintubuleintegrity . Fixedsampleswereexaminedunderaconfocalmicro - scope ( Leica Microsystems ) . For live cell imaging , HeLa cells were grown to subconfluence on FluoroDish chambers with integrated glass coverslips ( World Precision Instruments ) . When indicated , cells were incubated in the presence of 5 m gml 2 1 of FM4 - 64 dye . GUVs were transferred into a chamber containing various concentrations of labelled STxBor anti - Gb3 antibody in PBS buffer . Live - cell imaging of cells or GUVs was performed using a Zeiss inverted confocal microscope ( LSM 510 , Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a Zeiss 3 63 PL APO HCX , 1 . 4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective . Observations were made at room temperature or at 37 u C . Montages were prepared using Metamorph Software 6 . 2 . 6 and Photoshop 7 . 0 ( Adobe ) . Only Movie 6 is based on images recorded with a Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope from Andor . For evanescent - field microscopy , Alexa488 - STxB ( 20nM ) was bound to energy - depleted cells , which were then shifted for 15min to 37 u C in the con - tinued presence of the energy - depletion compounds . The cells were placed on thestageofanIX71microscope ( Olympus ) equippedwithaZeiss1 . 45numerical aperture objective . Evanescent - field illumination was obtained with a 488nm laser ( Sapphire , Coherent ) adjustedforapenetrationdepthof100nm . Cellswere visualized with both evanescent - field illumination and wide - field illumination ( obtained with a xenon lamp and an excitation filter ) . During DOG / N 3 washout ( at 37 u C ) , we performed time - lapse recordings with evanescent - field illumina - tion every 5s . After tubule disappearance , another image using wide - field illu - mination was taken . Laurdan - 2 photon microscopy and data analysis . Laurdan intensity images were recorded with a DM IRE2 Microscope ( Leica ) equipped with photon - multiplier tubes and Leica acquisition software . Laurdan fluorescence was excitedat800nmwithaVerdi / Mira900multi - photonlasersystemandintensity images were recorded simultaneously in the emission range of 400 – 460nm and 470 – 530nm 30 . Microscopy calibrations were performed as described pre - viously 30 . For confocal STxB images of the same focal depth , a helium – neon laser was used to excite Cy3 ( excitation , 543nm ; emmision , 550 – 620nm ) with appropriate cut - off filters and pinhole widths . For fixed cells , a 100 3 oil objec - tive , 1 . 4 numerical aperturewas used ; for live cells , a 63 3 water objective , 1 . 3 numerical aperture was used . To calculate generalized polarization ( GP ) images , defined as : GP ~ I ( 400 (cid:1) 460 ) { I ( 470 (cid:1) 530 ) I ( 400 (cid:1) 460 ) z I ( 470 (cid:1) 530 ) intensity images were converted into floating point format , and the GP value for eachpixelcalculatedandconvertedbackintoan8 - bitunsignedformat . FinalGP images were pseudo - coloured in Adobe Photoshop ( see colour scale in Fig . 4d ) . TodetermineGPvaluesatsitesenrichedinSTxB , confocalSTxBimagesofthe same focal depth were used to mask the GP images ; the confocal images defined the regions of interest and the mean GP value of the regions of interest was determined for each image . GP values were corrected using the G - factor obtained for Laurdan in DMSO for each experiment 30 . To analyse changes in global membrane structure , GP distributions were obtained from the histograms of typically . 30 GP images from a single experi - ment to minimize differences in Laurdan distribution between intracellular membranes , normalized ( sum 5 100 ) and fitted to two gaussian distributions usingthenonlinearfittingalgorithm ( MicrosoftExcel ) . Thequalityofthefitwas tested as previously described 31 . GUV formation . Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) were grown using the elec - troformation technique , essentially as previously described 44 . The lipid mixtures were prepared in chloroform at a total concentration of 0 . 5mgml 2 1 with the appropriatelipidratio . Vesiclesweregrowninasolutionofsucrose ( typicallyata concentrationof298mM ) adjustedto300mOsm , correspondingtotheosmotic pressure of the protein solution . The size of observed vesicles ranged between 10 and30 m m . Thedifferenceindensitybetweentheoutside ( PBS ) andtheinsideof the vesicles led to their sedimentation . Experiments on supported lipid bilayers . Mixed lipid films were prepared by dryinglipidsdissolvedinchloroformunderastreamofnitrogen , followedby3h under vacuum at 60 u C . Multilamellar vesicles were obtained by allowing the lipidfilmstoswellinPBSat50 u Candthenvortexingseveraltimes . Theresulting multilamellar vesicles were subsequently converted into large unilamellar vesi - cles by extrusion using a mini - extruder ( LiposoFast , Avestin ) supplied with a 50nm polycarbonate membrane at 50 u C . The large unilamellar vesicles were deposited on a freshly cleaved mica plate and were incubated for 1h at 50 u C . Surface images were obtained in an open Teflon fluid chamber using a JPK NanoWizard scanning force microscope ( JPK Instruments ) . Measurements were performed in PBS buffer in contact / tapping mode using microfabricated silicon tips with a typical resonant frequency of 10 / 21kHz and a nominal spring constant of 0 . 03 / 0 . 3Nm 2 1 . Usual scan rates were set between 0 . 6 – 1 . 1Hz . The image resolution was 512 3 512 pixels . Height was analysed from a number of areas of several images . Chemical methods . To synthesize the target Gb3 analogues 1 – 4 , 3 - O - benzoyloxyazidosphingosine is a typical acceptor for coupling with globotriosyl donors . Theacceptorisreadilyavailablefromazidosphingosinebyregioselective silylationoftheprimaryOH - groupfollowedbybenzoylationthendesilylation 46 . We attempted here , in Method A ( below ) , to ensue direct regioselective acetyla - tion of the secondary OH - group in azidosphingosine using the triethylorthoa - cetate method 47 . Thus azidosphingosine 5 ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) was treated with triethylorthoacetate in the presence of p - TsOH to afford an intermediate cyclic orthoester that was opened by treatment with AcOH . Unfortunately , a mixture of two compounds of the same mass corresponding to 1 - acetoxy and 3 - acetoxyazidosphingosines respectively was formed in the ratio of 2 : 1 . These compounds were assigned easily from the COSY - spectrum in which the olefinic protons , centred at 5 . 8 and 5 . 5p . p . m . showed a cross signal with H - 3 at 4 . 13p . p . m . in the case of 6 and at higher shift , 5 . 34p . p . m . in the case of 7 . To overcomethisnon - regioselectiveacetylationandlowyieldof 7 , compound 5 was treatedwith thexylchloridein pyridineat 2 40 u C to assistthe selective silylation of the primary hydroxyl group followed by acetylation with Ac 2 O in pyridine . Monitoring of these two steps by TLC showed only one spot , although ensuing desilylationwithTBAF - AcOHin THFshoweda major productof lower R f value corresponding to 7 , and a minor product of higher R f value corresponding to 6 . Inthisway ( MethodB ; SupplementaryFig . 15 ) , compound 5 wasacetylatedwith high selectivity at the 3 - OH group and compound 7 was obtained as an alterna - tive to the benzoylated analogue in 68 % yield over three steps along with the formationof 6 in3 % yield , whichwasseparatedeasilybyFlashchromatography . Compound 7 wasthencoupledwithaknownglobotriaosyltrichloroacetamidate donor 8 , for which weintroduced recently a facile approachfor its synthesis 48 , in the presence of TMSOTf ( 6 mol % ) as promoter under the inverse procedure at temperature gradient from 0 u C to 18 u C to afford glycoside 9 in 48 % yield . The relatively acidic conditions used to avoid formation of orthoester may be responsible for this moderate yield due to hydrolysis of the donor , which becomes a competitive reaction . The b - anomeric configuration of the newly formed stereogenic centre at the reducing terminal was easily deduced from the signal of H - 2a ( 1 H NMR ) d 4 . 88 ( J 1 , 2 7 . 8Hz ) . Deacetylation of 9 under Zemple´n conditions afforded simply the acyl free Gb3 , compound 1 . To complete the synthesis of the desired analogues 2 – 4 , we chose the Staudinger reduction of the azido group of 9 in the presence of the correspond - ingacideitherasanhydride , ifcommerciallyavailablelikelauricanhydride , oras p - nitrophenyl ester in the case of docosanoic acid and erucic acid to quench the liberated amine as soon as it is formed , thus to avoid trans - acetylation of the free amine as a competitive reaction . To prepare the novel p - nitrophenyl esters of 10 and 11 , the acids were con - densed with p - nitrophenol in the presence of DIEA and DCC as dehydrating agenttoproduceesters 12 and 13 inverygoodyields ( SupplementaryFig . 16 ) . To finalize the synthesis of Gb3 - analogues 2 – 4 , compound 9 was treated with PPh 3 in pyridine - H 2 O and lauric anhydride to produce 14 ( 32 % ) , or p - nitrophenyl ester 12 to yield 15 ( 17 % ) , or p - nitrophenyl ester 13 to afford 16 ( 16 % ) . Generally , acid anhydride afforded better yield than the p - nitrophenyl esters forwhichtheyieldinthecaseoflauricanhydridewasinagreementwithprevious doi : 10 . 1038 / nature05996 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup coupling for other chains 49 . Assignment of intermediate acetylated Gb3 - analogues 14 – 16 was proven easily from MS as well as 1 H NMR by virtue of the amide proton doublet centred at < 5 . 65 p . p . m . in all analogues with nearby J 2 , NH values of < 9 . 1Hz that were in good agreement with related known analo - gues of Gb3 49 . Despite the low yield of amide bond formation , deacetylation of the available amounts of esters 14 – 16 under Zemple´n conditions afforded the desired Gb3 - analogues 2 – 4 smoothly in nearly quantitative yield to provide sufficient materials for studying their relation to the STx - endocytosis pathway . Attempts to modify the acylation step using DCC alternatives 50 were not sat - isfactory and purification was extremely difficult , data are not shown . General chemical methods . Solvents were purified in the usual way . Thin layer chromatography was performed on plastic plates Silica Gel 60 F 254 ( E . Merck , layerthickness0 . 2mm ) . Thedetectionwasachievedbytreatmentwithasolution of 20g ammonium molybdate and 0 . 4g cerium ( IV ) sulphate in 400ml 10 % H 2 SO 4 or with 15 % H 2 SO 4 , and heating at 150 u C . Flash chromatography was carried out on silica gel ( Baker , 30 – 60 m m ) , type 1 silica , or Lichroprep Si 60 ( Merck ; diameter 15 – 25 m m ) , type - 2 silica . Optical rotation was determined at 20 u C with a Perkin - Elmer 241 / MC polarimeter ( 1dm cell ) . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectra were recorded with a Bruker AC 300 DRX instrument with Me 4 Si as internal standard ; J values are given in Hz . The assignment of 1 H NMR ( 300MHz ) spectra was based on chemical shift correlation ( DQFCOSY ) , whereas the assignment of 13 C NMR ( 75MHz ) spectra were based on Carbon - Proton Shift - Correlation Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence ( HMQC ) . Mass spectrometry spectra were recorded with MALDI - Kompakt ( Kratos ) using a - cyano - 3 , 5 - dihydroxycinamic acid ( CHCA ) , whereas Fast Atom Bombardment ( FAB ) spectra were recorded with a Jeol MS700 apparatus from the Ecole Normale Supe´rieure ( ENS , Paris ) .
