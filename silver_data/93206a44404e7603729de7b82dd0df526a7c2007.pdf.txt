However , their 19 genomic landscapes and compositions remain largely unexplored due to a lack of 20 dedicated computational tools for systematic identification in vivo . To address this , we 21 developed CondSigDetector , a computational framework designed to detect 22 condensate - like chromatin - associated protein co - occupancy signatures ( CondSigs ) , 23 to predict genomic loci and component proteins of distinct chromatin - associated 24 biomolecular condensates . Applying this framework to mouse embryonic stem cells 25 ( mESC ) and human K562 cells enabled us to depict the high - resolution genomic 26 landscape of chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates , and uncover both 27 known and potentially novel biomolecular condensates . Multi - omics analysis and 28 experimental validation further verified the condensation properties of CondSigs . 29 Additionally , our investigation shed light on the impact of chromatin - associated 30 biomolecular condensates on chromatin activities . Collectively , CondSigDetector 31 provides a novel approach to decode the genomic landscape of chromatin - associated 32 condensates , facilitating a deeper understanding of their biological functions and 33 underlying mechanisms in cells . 34 35 Introduction 36 Over the last decade , there has been growing appreciation for the biological role of 37 biomolecular condensates , which are membraneless compartments that 38 compartmentalize and concentrate specific proteins and / or nucleic acids 1 , 2 . Liquid - 39 liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) has been proposed as a key organizing principle of 40 biomolecular condensates , driven by weak , multivalent , and highly collaborative 41 molecular interactions 2 . The molecular interactions inside biomolecular condensates 42 usually involve diverse collaborative components that can be categorized into two 43 main groups : scaffolds and clients . Scaffolds drive the formation of condensates , while 44 clients participate by binding to scaffolds 3 - 6 . Biomolecular condensates are implicated 45 in various cellular functions , and their aberrations are associated with numerous 46 diseases 1 , 7 . Recently , growing evidences have demonstrated the widespread 47 existence and functional significance of chromatin - associated biomolecular 48 condensates . Many chromatin - associated processes , such as DNA replication 8 , DNA 49 repair 9 , transcription control 10 - 13 , and chromatin organization 14 - 17 , have been found to 50 take place within biomolecular condensates at chromatin 18 ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . 51 52 Understanding chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates , including their 53 genomic loci and collaborative components , is crucial for elucidating their impact on 54 chromatin activities . Although some chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates 55 have been linked to well - characterized chromatin states , such as super - enhancer 10 , 11 56 and heterochromatin 15 - 17 , these connections have generally been reported without 57 comprehensive associations with genome - wide loci , except for a few loci of interest 58 validated by low - throughput experiments . Until now , the genomic landscape of 59 chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates has remained poorly understood . 60 However , no genomic approach has been designed yet to capture the comprehensive 61 genomic landscape of chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates , primarily due 62 to the following challenges . First , the complexity of biomolecular condensates arising 63 from their diverse components 18 and context - specific molecular collaborations among 64 these components along the chromatin 13 , making it difficult to systematically capture 65 chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates by targeting a single factor . Second , 66 even for chromatin - associated protein ( CAP ) with experimental evidence of 67 condensation 3 - 6 , 19 , distinguishing its condensation - associated binding sites from non - 68 associated binding sites in individual datasets is not a straightforward task . 69 70 With the rapid accumulation of CAP occupancy profiles and proteome - scale 71 characterization of condensation potential , it is now possible to overcome the above 72 challenges of decoding the genomic landscape of chromatin - associated biomolecular 73 condensates by integrating multi - dimensional data . In this study , we introduce 74 CondSigDetector , a computational framework that systematically predicts chromatin - 75 associated biomolecular condensates . This framework overcomes the two challenges 76 mentioned above by utilizing topic modeling to detect genome - wide context - 77 dependent collaborations among CAPs possessing high condensation potential from 78 hundreds of CAP occupancy profiles . These collaborations along the chromatin are 79 termed Condensate - like chromatin - associated protein co - occupancy Signatures 80 ( CondSigs ) . The framework not only identifies the collaborative components of distinct 81 biomolecular condensates , but also assigns them to the associated genomic loci . We 82 applied this computational framework to two cell types with abundant ChIP - seq data , 83 and predicted hundreds of chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates , along 84 with their genomic loci , which are supported by multi - omics data and experimental 85 evidences . To the best of our knowledge , CondSigDetector is the first computational 86 framework for decoding the genomic landscape of chromatin - associated biomolecular 87 condensates , providing a valuable resource for investigating the functional effects and 88 underlying mechanisms of chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates on 89 chromatin activities . 90 91 Results 92 Overall design of CondSigDetector 93 By integrating ChIP - seq datasets of hundreds of CAPs in the same cell type , we 94 observed frequent co - occupancy of CAPs across the genome ( Supplementary Fig . 95 S1a , b ) . However , most co - occupancy events could not be explained by DNA binding 96 motifs or chromatin accessibility ( Supplementary Fig . S1c - f ) , two known determinants 97 of CAP co - occupancy events 20 . This suggests that alternative mechanisms may be 98 responsible for organizing genome - wide co - occupancy events of CAPs . Biomolecular 99 condensation at chromatin may partially explain such events , as biomolecular 100 condensates are thought to be mediated by collaborations of components 2 , and 101 condensations of CAPs have been reported to influence their chromatin 102 occupancy 10 , 21 . This evidence implies that specific CAP co - occupancy events could 103 be signatures of chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates . 104 105 In this study , we aim to predict chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates by 106 detecting genome - wide context - dependent collaborations of CAPs with high 107 condensation potential , termed CondSig . We developed a computational framework , 108 CondSigDetector , to systematically detect CondSigs by integrating hundreds of ChIP - 109 seq datasets and condensation - related characterizations of CAPs ( Fig . 1 ) . 110 CondSigDetector comprises three steps : data processing , co - occupancy signatures 111 identification , and condensation potential filtration . 112 113 In the first step , the input data , i . e . , the collected ChIP - seq profiles of all CAPs from 114 an identical cell type , is converted into an occupancy matrix at genome - wide 115 consecutive bins . To address the sparsity of this matrix , CondSigDetector applies an 116 iterative segmentation method for each target CAP , which segments the entire 117 occupancy matrix into smaller sub - matrices ( see Methods for details ) . This 118 segmentation approach can enhance the detection of CAP collaborations in local 119 contexts by substantially increasing the occurrence frequency of co - occupancy events 120 within the sub - matrices ( Supplementary Fig . S1g , h ) . 121 122 In the second step , CondSigDetector utilizes a topic model to identify co - occupancy 123 signatures of CAPs , representing frequent CAP collaborations , from the sub - matrices . 124 Given the significant differences in co - occupancy frequencies between promoter and 125 non - promoter regions ( Supplementary Fig . S1a , b ) , the sub - matrices are categorized 126 into either promoter or non - promoter groups to identify co - occupancy signatures 127 separately . Within the topic model , each sub - matrix is treated as a set of documents , 128 where each genomic bin represents a document and CAPs occupying the bin are 129 considered as words in the document . Intuitively , the topics learned from topic 130 modeling , which indicate specific word combinations , can be interpreted as co - 131 occupancy signatures of CAPs . Since the number of co - occupied CAPs within a bin is 132 typically sparse ( Supplementary Fig . S1a , b ) , CondSigDetector utilizes the biterm topic 133 model , which outperforms traditional models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation for 134 short text 22 . It has been confirmed that the co - occupancy signatures of CAPs derived 135 from the biterm topic model exhibit high topic coherence and repeatability among 136 replicates ( see Methods for details ; Supplementary Fig . S1i - l ) . 137 138 In the third step , CondSigDetector predicts CondSigs by evaluating the condensation 139 potential for each co - occupancy signature of CAPs . For each genomic bin , 6 140 condensation - related features are calculated : the fraction of occupied CAPs with 141 reported LLPS capacity , the fraction of occupied CAPs co - occurring in the same 142 membraneless organelle ( MLO ) , the fraction of occupied CAPs with predicted 143 intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) , the fraction of occupied CAP pairs having 144 protein - protein interactions ( PPIs ) , the fraction of occupied CAPs predicted as RNA - 145 binding proteins ( RBPs ) , and the RNA - binding strength ( RBS ) of the bin . Intuitively , 146 for a co - occupancy signature of CAPs , higher values of these condensation - related 147 features at signature - positive bins indicate a greater condensation potential . Co - 148 occupancy signatures with at least 3 condensation - related features strongly and 149 positively correlated with their presence are identified as CondSigs ( see Methods for 150 details ) . Finally , CondSigDetector eliminates redundant CondSigs containing similar 151 CAP components . 152 153 Identification of CondSigs in mouse and human cell lines 154 CondSigDetector was applied to two cell types with abundant ChIP - seq data : mESC 155 and human K562 cell line , to identify CondSigs . After stringent quality control , we 156 gathered qualified ChIP - seq data for 189 CAPs in mESC and 216 CAPs in K562 157 ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Due to the lack of a qualified RNA - binding profile for mESC , 158 the RNA binding strength , one of the condensation - related features , was not included 159 in mESC . We identified 25 promoter CondSigs and 36 non - promoter CondSigs in 160 mESC ( Fig . 2a ) , along with 75 promoter CondSigs and 93 non - promoter CondSigs in 161 K562 ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Additionally , we identified 14 , 345 promoter CondSig - 162 positive sites and 24 , 500 non - promoter CondSig - positive sites in mESC , along with 163 14 , 201 and 38 , 963 CondSig - positive sites in K562 . To assess the reliability of 164 identified CondSigs , we examined whether their component CAPs are involved in 165 known chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates . Among the identified mESC 166 CondSigs , 92 . 0 % of promoter and 97 . 2 % of non - promoter CondSigs contain at least 167 one component CAP present in known chromatin - associated biomolecular 168 condensates ( Fig . 2b ) . For example , a non - promoter CondSig contains SS18 , 169 SMARCA4 ( BRG1 ) , and DPF2 , which are three known components of the known 170 SS18 cluster 23 ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . S3a , Supplementary Table S1 ) . In K562 171 cells , 49 . 3 % of promoter and 55 . 9 % of non - promoter CondSigs have at least one 172 component CAP found in known chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates ( Fig . 173 2b ) . One example of a non - promoter CondSig includes CBX5 ( HP1α ) , TRIM28 and 174 CBX1 ( HP1β ) ( Supplementary Fig . S3b , Supplementary Table S1 ) , with HP1 and 175 TRIM28 were reported to drive LLPS with H3K9me3 - modified chromatin 176 cooperatively 15 . These results provide support for the reliability of the identified 177 CondSigs . 178 179 Some component CAPs are found in more than one identified CondSig 180 ( Supplementary Fig . S3c - d ) . For example , DDX21 , a DEAD - box RNA helicase known 181 to participate in biomolecular condensate 24 , is present in 8 non - promoter CondSigs in 182 mESC . We examined the similarity of present loci between CondSig pairs containing 183 at least one shared component CAP and found that only 0 . 6 % of mESC pairs and 0 . 9 % 184 of K562 pairs had a Jaccard index higher than 0 . 7 . This suggests a high diversity of 185 present loci of identified CondSigs , even when they share some common components . 186 To investigate the potential roles of component CAPs in CondSigs , we classified all 187 predicted component CAPs into four clusters : “both scaffold and client” , “scaffold - only” , 188 “client - only” , and “none” , according to their calculated potentials for self - assembly or 189 interaction with partners to undergo phase separation 25 ( see Methods for details ) . 77 . 5 % 190 and 79 . 5 % of component CAPs in mESC and K562 were classified into “both scaffold 191 and client” or “scaffold - only” clusters ( Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , we found that component 192 CAPs of CondSigs have a significantly higher fraction of charged amino acid blocks 193 ( Fig . 2d ) , which is an important resource for multivalency 26 . These results demonstrate 194 that the component CAPs of identified CondSigs have strong capacities to form 195 biomolecular condensates , and may function in a context - dependent manner . 196 197 The previous studies demonstrated that biomolecular condensate can form at super - 198 enhancers , i . e . , clusters of enhancers densely occupied by the master regulators and 199 mediators , and these condensates can regulate gene transcription by concentrating 200 transcription machinery 10 , 27 . When comparing the genomic loci of super - enhancers 201 and CondSig - positive sites in mESC , we found that 96 . 1 % of super - enhancers overlap 202 with CondSig - positive sites . Furthermore , a recent study introduced DisP - seq , an 203 antibody - independent chemical precipitation assay , to map genome - wide profiles of 204 disordered proteins 28 . We reanalyzed public DisP - seq data from three human cell lines 205 and compared the DisP - seq peaks with identified CondSig - positive sites in the K562 206 cell line . In SKNMC , MRC5 , and H446 cells , 16 . 1 % , 21 . 0 % , and 18 . 5 % of DisP - seq 207 peaks , respectively , were identified as CondSig - positive sites in K562 . But among the 208 shared DisP - seq peaks across the three human cell lines , 60 . 6 % were identified as 209 CondSig - positive sites in K562 ( Fig . 2e ) . We further observed much higher DisP - seq 210 signals at CondSig - positive sites in K562 compared to their adjacent regions ( Fig . 2f ) , 211 suggesting that identified CondSig - positive sites are highly occupied by disordered 212 proteins , which have been demonstrated to play important roles in biomolecular 213 condensation 2 . These results point towards the high potential of identified CondSig - 214 positive sites as genomic loci where biomolecular condensates form . 215 216 Chromatin properties of identified CondSigs 217 To investigate the chromatin features of identified CondSigs , we first analyzed the 218 concentration levels of the component within CondSigs by calculating ChIP - seq signal 219 strength for each component . We divided the ChIP - seq peaks of each component 220 CAP into CondSig - positive groups and - negative groups based on their overlap with 221 positive sites of CondSigs ( see Methods for details ) , and compared their ChIP - seq 222 signals . As shown in Fig . 3a , most component CAPs displayed significantly higher 223 signal strength at CondSig - positive peaks in mESC , indicating that CondSigs can 224 concentrate their components at target genomic loci . For example , CTCF , a CAP 225 involved in chromatin insulation 29 , exhibited significantly higher signal strength at 226 CondSig - positive CTCF peaks . To investigate the biological functional effect of CTCF 227 concentration , we re - analyzed Micro - C data in mESC 30 and found that CondSig - 228 positive CTCF peaks exhibited significantly higher boundary strength than CondSig - 229 negative CTCF peaks ( Fig . 3b ) , suggesting that CTCF concentration contributes to 230 enhanced chromatin insulation activity . We then merged the adjacent ChIP - seq peaks 231 to obtain domains for each component CAP ( see Methods for details ) , and compared 232 the width distributions of CondSig - positive and - negative domains . As shown in Fig . 233 3c , CondSig - positive domains are wider on average for 95 . 2 % and 93 . 5 % of all 234 component CAPs of promoter and non - promoter CondSigs , and the CondSig - positive 235 domains of RUVBL1 , TCF3 , CTR9 , MTF2 and SUPT6H exceeded 10 kb on average . 236 Additionally , we assessed the component concentration levels and domain widths of 237 CondSigs in K562 and found largely consistent results ( Supplementary Fig . S4a , b ) . 238 These results confirmed the component concentration properties of CondSigs , which 239 is a basic feature of known chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates 18 , and 240 suggested a potential association between biomolecular condensation and stronger 241 effects on chromatin activities . 242 243 Based on previous studies that reported spatially proximal chromatin could be involved 244 in the same condensates 31 , 32 , we processed to analyze chromatin contact frequencies 245 within and between CondSig - positive and - negative domains for each component CAP . 246 In order to minimize the impact of distinct width distributions between CondSig - positive 247 and - negative domains , we focused on broad domains ( width > 5 kb ) . We used cohesin 248 ChIA - PET data from mESC 33 to measure chromatin interactions between genomic loci , 249 and found that CondSig - positive domains exhibited significantly higher intra - domain 250 interactions than their CondSig - negative counterparts ( Fig . 3d ) . We further calculated 251 the fractions of domains with chromatin interactions within the same group of domains 252 for each component CAP , and found significantly higher frequencies between 253 CondSig - positive domains compared to CondSig - negative domains ( Fig . 3e ) . For 254 each component CAP presented in both promoter and non - promoter CondSigs , we 255 calculated fractions of domains with chromatin interactions between its promoter and 256 non - promoter domains . Our analysis observed that CondSig - positive domains showed 257 significantly higher frequencies between promoter and non - promoter domains relative 258 to CondSig - negative domains ( Fig . 3f ) . We also utilized Pol II ChIA - PET data 34 to 259 evaluate the chromatin contact frequencies of CondSigs in K562 , and observed largely 260 consistent results ( Supplementary Fig . S4c - e ) . These results confirmed that the 261 components of identified CondSigs can be concentrated in trans through spatially 262 proximal chromatin . 263 264 Involvement of DDX21 in chromatin - associated biomolecular condensate 265 Although DDX21 can undergo phase separation and has been reported to participate 266 in nucleolar condensate for Pol I transcription 24 , 35 , additional genomic loci where it may 267 involve into biomolecular condensate remain to be elucidated . In mESC , we identified 268 10 CondSigs with DDX21 as a component , with 15 , 578 DDX21 ChIP - seq peaks as 269 CondSig - positive . To verify the presence of DDX21 - associated biomolecular 270 condensate at these genomic loci , we assessed the sensitivity of DDX21 occupancy 271 at these loci to 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( 1 , 6 - HD ) , a compound used for disrupting liquid - like 272 biomolecular condensates 36 . Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease 273 ( CUT & RUN ) experiments were conducted for DDX21 in both wild type and 1 , 6 - HD - 274 treated mESC . We observed a significantly greater decrease in DDX21 CUT & RUN 275 signals at CondSig - positive peaks compared to CondSig - negative peaks ( Fig . 4a , b ) , 276 which demonstrated the strong effect of biomolecular condensate disruption on 277 CondSig - positive peaks of DDX21 . This result supported that DDX21 participates in 278 biomolecular condensates at these loci . We further investigated the potential impact 279 of DDX21 - associated biomolecular condensates at these genomic loci . We found that 280 target genes of the CondSig - positive peaks of DDX21 displayed significantly higher 281 expression levels than other genes ( Supplementary Fig . S5a ) , suggesting that 282 DDX21 - associated biomolecular condensate may enhance the transcription of target 283 genes . 284 285 Confirmation of CondSigs regulating transcription elongation 286 SUPT6H , SUPT5H and CTR9 have been reported to regulate transcription 287 elongation 37 , 38 , but it remains unclear whether these CAPs function in the form of 288 condensate . In mESC , we identified two CondSigs containing all or at least three of 289 SUPT6H , SUPT5H , CTR9 , and POLR2A simultaneously ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig , 290 S5b ) . Genomic enrichment analysis found that merged CondSig - positive sites of the 291 two CondSigs were primarily located at promoters and gene bodies ( especially at 292 exons ) , and the associated gene bodies were enriched with H3K36me3 modification , 293 a marker for actively transcribed genes ( Supplementary Fig . S5c , d ) . This suggested 294 that SUPT6H , SUPT5H and CTR9 might participate in the same biomolecular 295 condensate to regulate transcription elongation . To confirm the condensation 296 properties of these component CAPs , we performed fixed cell immunofluorescence 297 ( IF ) with antibodies against SUPT6H , SUPT5H and CTR9 in mESC . We found that all 298 three CAPs can form nuclear puncta in cells ( Fig . 4c ) , which is consistent with a recent 299 study showing the condensation properties of SUPT6H and CTR9 in cells 39 . To 300 determine whether these CAPs coexist in the same puncta , we conducted co - IF 301 analysis and found their high co - localization in nuclei ( Fig . 4c , d ) . To further verify the 302 presence of the associated biomolecular condensate at these CondSig - positive sites , 303 we conducted CUT & RUN experiments for SUPT6H and CTR9 in both wild type and 304 1 , 6 - HD - treated mESC . We observed that CondSig - positive sites exhibited significantly 305 greater decreases in CUT & RUN signals for both SUPT6H and CTR9 compared to 306 control sites upon 1 , 6 - HD treatment ( Fig . 4e , f ) . These results suggested that SUPT6H , 307 SUPT5H and CTR9 can regulate transcription elongation by forming biomolecular 308 condensate . 309 310 Effects of biomolecular condensate on chromatin activities 311 With the availability of CondSig - positive sites , it is possible to investigate the influence 312 of biomolecular condensates on chromatin activities at a genome - wide scale . Our 313 initial analysis for histone modifications at CondSig - positive sites revealed a high 314 enrichment of active histone modifications , such as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac , in both 315 mESC and K562 ( Fig . 5a ) , suggesting a close association between biomolecular 316 condensates and chromatin activities . We predicted the target genes associated with 317 the CondSig - positive sites ( see Methods for details ) , discovering that these genes 318 showed significantly higher expression levels in both mESC and K562 ( Supplementary 319 Fig . S6a , b ) . Given that transcriptional bursting is a common characteristic of gene 320 expression 40 , and it was hypothesized that biomolecular condensation can influence 321 the transcriptional bursting frequencies of target genes 41 , we generated single - cell 322 RNA - seq data in wild type and 1 , 6 - HD - treated mESC and K562 , from which we 323 inferred transcriptome - wide transcriptional bursting kinetics 42 . Among the genes with 324 inferable transcriptional bursting kinetics , those associated with CondSig - positive sites 325 exhibited significantly higher bursting frequencies in the wild type mESC and K562 326 ( Fig . 5b , c ) . They also displayed a more substantial decrease in transcriptional bursting 327 frequencies upon 1 , 6 - HD treatment compared to other genes ( Fig . 5d , e ) . After 328 assigning genes associated with CondSig - positive sites to individual CondSig , we 329 ranked the CondSigs in mESC according to the decrease level of transcriptional 330 bursting frequencies upon 1 , 6 - HD treatment . As shown in Fig . 5f , the CondSig 331 containing PRDM4 , ARID1A , TET2 , MED12 , MED1 , EP300 and SS18 demonstrated 332 the most substantial decrease , suggesting that these CAPs may form biomolecular 333 condensation to enhance the transcriptional bursting frequencies of their target genes . 334 On the contrary , the CondSig containing SUZ12 , JARID2 , KDM4C , PCGF2 , EZH2 , 335 RNF2 and CBX7 had the most increase , consistent with their repressive roles in 336 transcription regulation 43 . And target genes of CondSigs in K562 exhibited decreased 337 burst frequency on average ( Supplementary Fig . S6c ) . These results suggested that 338 biomolecular condensation can regulate gene transcription by influencing 339 transcriptional bursting frequency . 340 341 Notably , several histone modification writers , such as EP300 and KMT2D , were 342 included in the components of identified CondSigs . Given the enrichment of their 343 corresponding histone modifications at CondSig - positive sites ( Fig . 5a ) , we 344 hypothesized that these histone modification writers might exhibit stronger 345 catalyzation activities within biomolecular condensates . We classified each histone 346 modification writer’s ChIP - seq peaks into CondSig - positive and - negative peaks , and 347 observed significantly stronger corresponding histone modification products at 348 CondSig - positive peaks ( Supplementary Fig . S6d , e ) , suggesting the formation of 349 biomolecular condensation can boost the catalyzation activities of histone modification 350 writers . Active modifications , such as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac , typically display narrow 351 peaks ( width < 2 kb ) , while a small proportion also exists as broad peaks ( width > 352 5kb ) 27 , 44 . The establishment of these broad histone modification domains remains 353 unclear , hence we next investigated whether the involvement of their writer in 354 biomolecular condensation could play a role . We transformed two histone 355 modifications’ peaks to domains by merging adjacent peaks not further than 5 kb . 356 Among 1 , 217 H3K4me3 broad peaks in mESC , 63 . 3 % of them overlapped with 357 KMT2D - associated CondSig - positive sites , while the percentage is only 38 . 0 % for 358 narrow peaks ( Fig . 5g ) . Similar results were observed for the pair of H3K27ac and 359 EP300 , not only in mESC , but also in K562 ( Fig . 5g , h ) . These results demonstrated 360 that the involvement of histone modification writers in biomolecular condensates can 361 alter chromatin activity by catalyzing broad histone modification domains . 362 363 Discussion 364 The field of biomolecular condensate research associated with chromatin has made 365 substantial advancements in recent years . However , identifying the involvement of a 366 CAP in chromatin - associated biomolecular condensate only scratches the surface of 367 its regulatory roles due to the following inherent limitations . Firstly , biomolecular 368 condensates typically comprise multiple components , each potentially contributing 369 different regulatory roles . Secondly , profiling the genomic binding sites of a CAP 370 involved in a biomolecular condensate does not necessarily distinguish its 371 condensation - associated and non - associated genomic loci in a straightforward 372 manner . Therefore , there is an urgent need for specialized experimental methods or 373 bioinformatic tools to provide a detailed genomic landscape of chromatin - associated 374 biomolecular condensates . A recent study introduced DisP - seq 28 , an antibody - 375 independent chemical precipitation assay that maps endogenous DNA - associated 376 disordered proteins at a genomic scale . However , DisP - seq was designed for the 377 broad detection of disordered proteins rather than specifically targeting biomolecular 378 condensates . This could potentially result in both false positives , as not all binding 379 sites of these proteins participate in biomolecular condensates , and false negatives , 380 as disordered protein - guided phase separation is only one mechanism of 381 condensation . Furthermore , DisP - seq cannot identify the exact components present 382 at each locus . In response to these challenges , our study presented CondSigDetector , 383 a computational framework designed to systematically identify CondSigs , i . e . , the 384 signatures of condensate - like chromatin - associate protein co - occupancy , and their 385 associated genomic loci . By leveraging the occupancy profiles and condensation - 386 related features of hundreds of CAPs in the same cell type , we can predict the 387 genome - wide loci of biomolecular condensates and the component CAPs of each 388 condensate . Our study both depicted the chromatin properties of the identified 389 CondSigs and experimentally validated the regulatory roles of DDX21 , SUPT6H , 390 CTR9 and SUPT5H as components of biomolecular condensates . Our study further 391 delves deeper into the significant effects of chromatin - associated biomolecular 392 condensates on transcriptional bursting and broad active histone modification 393 domains . These findings underscored the critical role that biomolecular condensates 394 play in gene regulation and chromatin activities . 395 396 The CondSigs identified in this study provided a comprehensive , global and genome - 397 wide perspective on distinct chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates , paving 398 the way for further exploration of their biological functions and mechanisms . By 399 distinguishing various biomolecular condensates through the unique component CAPs , 400 the CondSigs can not only aid in discovering additional components of known 401 chromatin - associated biomolecular condensates , but also reveal entirely new ones . 402 Furthermore , by pinpointing specific genomic loci targeted by biomolecular 403 condensates composed of CAPs , CondSigs provide valuable insights into how 404 dysregulation of condensation may contribute to disease . This , in turn , could facilitate 405 the design of potential therapeutic strategies . To benefit future research in this area , 406 we have made the CondSigs identified in mESC and K562 publicly available online 407 and provided the source code of CondSigDetector on GitHub to enable the detection 408 in other biological systems . 409 410 Despite the significant insights provided by our identified CondSigs , there are some 411 limitations to the predictions . One such limitation is the dependence of CondSig 412 detection on accurate occupancy profiles of CAPs . The absence or poor quality of 413 ChIP - seq data could lead to partial or complete omission of biomolecular condensates . 414 For example , we were able to predict a heterochromatin - related condensate 415 consisting of CBX5 , TRIM28 and CBX1 in K562 , but not in mESC , due to the 416 unavailability of high - quality ChIP - seq data of these CAPs in mESC . However , with 417 the rapid increase of ChIP - seq data , and the implementation of new techniques for 418 occupancy map capture , we anticipate improvements in the sensitivity of CondSigs 419 detection . Another limitation is the reliance of CondSig detection on specific 420 collaborations among CAPs , which may result in the loss of widespread collaborations 421 in a global context . In this study , we used a threshold of 1 . 3 for the z - score normalized 422 occurrence probability of words in topics to determine the component CAPs of 423 CondSigs . Given the lack of a standard number for components in collaborations , the 424 components listed in CondSig might be incomplete or inaccurate , underscoring the 425 need for further in - depth analysis and experiments to verify the predictions . Finally , a 426 recent study reported that fixation , a common procedure used in X - ChIP , can have 427 diverse effects on biomolecular condensates in living cells 45 . To assess the potential 428 impact of fixation on our prediction results , we selected several component CAPs with 429 additional available data generated by CUT & RUN , a fixation - free technology , to 430 evaluate the concentration levels in CondSigs . We found that , similar to ChIP - seq 431 signals , most component CAPs showed significantly enriched CUT & RUN signals at 432 CondSig - positive peaks ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) , implying that the fixation effect in 433 the X - ChIP procedure is unlikely to significantly impact prediction accuracy . This 434 potential impact could be further mitigated with the rapid accumulation of more 435 CUT & RUN data for CAPs . 436 Methods 437 ChIP - seq data collection and processing 438 The ChIP - seq data of CAPs were collected from Cistrome Data Browser 46 and filtrated 439 using quality control procedures as described in the previous study 47 . In brief , only 440 ChIP - seq data that met at least four out of the five quality control metrics ( sequence 441 quality , mapping quality , library complexity , ChIP - enrichment , and signal - to - noise ratio ) 442 available in Cistrome Data Browser were kept . In cases where more than one qualified 443 ChIP - seq data were available for a given CAP in the same cell type , all qualified ChIP - 444 seq data were sorted based on quality control metrics , and the top - ranked data was 445 kept . 446 447 We downloaded ChIP - seq peak files ( in BED format ) and signal track files ( in bigWig 448 format ) from Cistrome Data Brower . Although Cistrome Data Browser stored narrow 449 peaks called by MACS2 48 for all CAPs , peak window sizes of distinct CAPs could differ 450 significantly . Therefore , to obtain accurate occupancy regions for each CAP , 451 especially CAPs with broad peaks , we first called broad peaks from the signal track 452 using “bdgbroadcall” module of MACS2 ( v2 . 1 . 3 ) with default parameters and then 453 merged adjacent peaks within 5 kb . For each CAP , if more than 1 , 000 newly called 454 peaks were wider than 5 kb , we replaced the original narrow peaks with newly called 455 broad peaks as the accurate occupancy regions . 456 457 Condensation - related annotation for proteins 458 Human and mouse proteins with reported LLPS capacity were collected from four 459 databases , DrLLPS 6 , LLPSDB 5 , PhaSepDB ( two versions , v1 and v2 ) 3 and PhaSePro 4 . 460 DrLLPS collected all proteins that could potentially be involved in LLPS , including 461 scaffolds , regulators and clients . However , we only regarded scaffolds as LLPS 462 proteins since DrLLPS contains too many regulators and clients . To create an 463 annotation of LLPS proteins , we merged all LLPS proteins from different sources . 464 Notably , since the number of collected mouse LLPS proteins ( 61 ) was much lower 465 than human LLPS proteins ( 437 ) , we also considered mouse orthologs of human LLPS 466 proteins as mouse LLPS proteins . 467 468 Component proteins of MLOs in human and mouse were collected from DrLLPS and 469 PhaSepDB ( v1 and v2 ) . Proteins that were assigned to the same MLO in different 470 sources were merged to form a comprehensive list of component proteins for that MLO . 471 Similar to LLPS proteins , mouse orthologs of human proteins assigned to the same 472 MLO was regarded as component proteins of that MLO in mouse . 473 474 Pairwise protein - protein interactions were collected from three databases , BioGRID 49 , 475 MINT 50 and IntAct 51 , only physical associations were kept . 476 477 Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins were predicted by MobiDB - lite ( v1 . 0 ) 52 . This 478 optimized method uses eight different predictors to derive a consensus , which is then 479 filtered for spurious short predictions in a second step . For each protein , if more than 480 15 . 3 % of its regions were predicted to be disordered by MobiDB - lite , the protein would 481 be regarded as proteins with intrinsically disordered regions . The threshold of 15 . 3 % 482 corresponds to the 20th percentile of disordered region fractions of known human 483 LLPS proteins . 484 485 RNA - binding proteins were predicted by TriPepSVM 53 , a method to perform de novo 486 prediction based on short amino acid motifs , with parameters “ - posW 1 . 8 - negW 0 . 2 - 487 thr 0 . 28” . 488 489 Genome - wide RNA - binding strength 490 We used genome - wide signals of R - ChIP data , an in vivo R - loop profiling approach 491 using catalytically dead RNase H1 54 , to quantify genome - wide RNA - binding strength 492 in K562 cells . Raw sequencing reads from GSE97072 54 were first aligned to human 493 genome build via default - - local mode of Bowtie2 ( v2 . 3 . 5 . 1 ) 55 . Low mapping quality 494 reads ( mapping quality < 30 ) and duplicates were discarded . Then signal tracks were 495 generated using the “genomecov” command in Bedtools software ( v2 . 28 . 0 ) , and 496 normalized to reads per million mapped reads ( RPM ) . 497 498 Motif scan 499 Motif scans were performed using FIMO ( v5 . 0 . 5 ) 56 against the JASPAR core 2020 500 vertebrates database 57 with the following parameters “ - - max - stored - scores 1000000” . 501 Motifs with p - value ≤ 1 × 10 - 5 were used for the following analysis . 502 503 CondSigDetector workflow 504 The framework consists of three steps , data processing , co - occupancy signature 505 identification and condensation potential filtration . 506 507 In the first step , the framework first splits mouse ( mm10 ) or human ( hg38 ) genome 508 into consecutive 1 - kb bins . It then generates an occupancy matrix of CAPs over these 509 1 - kb bins in the given cell type ( 𝑛 × 𝑚 ) , where 𝑛 denotes the number of 1 - kb bins and 510 𝑚 denotes the number of CAPs . The occupancy event of CAP at each genome - wide 511 1 - kb bin is determined by overlapping its ChIP - seq peaks with the given bin . It 512 excludes CAPs with too few occupancy events ( those occupying fewer than 500 bins ) 513 to eliminate the effect of low - quality ChIP - seq data . And bins with too many occupancy 514 events ( occupied by more than 90 % of CAPs ) are removed to avoid sequencing bias . 515 Additionally , bins in ENCODE Blacklist genomic regions are also discarded . 516 517 Identifying co - occupancy signatures from the entire occupancy matrix is a complicated 518 task that can result in the loss of low - frequency signatures in the local context . To 519 address this issue , CondSigDetector first segments the entire occupancy matrix into 520 overlapping sub - matrices iteratively . Each sub - matrix only contains occupancy events 521 of partial highly co - occupied CAPs at partial bins . The segmentation process is as 522 follows : ( i ) In each iteration , a focus CAP is selected and other CAPs highly co - 523 occupied with the focus CAP are identified . The co - occupancy levels of the focus CAP 524 and the other CAPs are evaluated by using the occupancy events of each other CAP 525 to classify occupancy events of the focus CAP . And then an F 1 score measuring the 526 accuracy of the classifier is defined as the co - occupancy score and assigned to each 527 other CAP , where a high co - occupancy score implies a high co - occupancy level . In 528 each sub - matrix , only co - occupancy information of the focus CAP and top 𝑞 − 1 other 529 CAPs ranked by the co - occupancy score are kept , where 𝑞 = 50 by default . ( ii ) After 530 the selection of partially highly co - occupied CAPs , partial bins that are occupied 531 frequently by these CAPs are screened out to further segment the matrix . For 𝑖 - th bin , 532 an occupancy score ( 𝑂𝑆 ! ) is defined to evaluate the occupancy level of the given CAPs 533 as : 534 𝑂𝑆 ! = / 𝛽 " 𝑋 ! " # " $ % ( 1 ) where 𝑋 ! " ∈ { 0 , 1 } denotes occupancy status of 𝑗 - th CAP at 𝑖 - th bin , and 𝛽 " denotes 𝑧 - 535 score normalized co - occupancy score . In each sub - matrix , only 𝑝 bins with 𝑂𝑆 ! > 0 are 536 kept . 537 538 In the second step , each sub - matrix is classified into promoter and non - promoter 539 contexts . Promoters were defined as upstream 3 kb to downstream 3 kb of 540 transcription start sites . CondSigDetector builds a biterm topic model 22 for each 541 context , treating 1 - kb bins as documents and occupied CAPs at those bins as words 542 within documents . By training the model , specific combinations of words can be 543 represented by learned topics , which in turn could be interpreted as co - occupancy 544 signatures representing collaborations of CAPs at chromatin . The biterm topic model 545 is implemented in CondSigDetector using source code from the previous study 22 . As 546 a probabilistic model , the biterm topic model generates two probability distributions , 547 matrix 𝐺 & × # representing occurrence probability of 𝑞 CAPs across 𝑘 topics and matrix 548 𝐺 ( × & representing occurrence probability of 𝑘 topics across 𝑝 documents . 549 550 The topic number , 𝑘 , is a crucial parameter in topic modeling , as it affects the topic 551 distribution . CondSigDetector empirically learns 2 ~ 10 topics for each context and then 552 applies an automatic strategy to select the optimal topic number as described in the 553 previous study 58 . The selection principle was based on the idea that the optimal topic 554 number should distinguish between documents with different topics as much as 555 possible . Hence an optimal topic number should match the following two criteria : ( i ) 556 The occurrence probability of each topic in different documents should be as different 557 as possible , which is measured by the specificity score ( 𝑆𝑆 & ) calculated for all topics 558 under a certain topic number 𝑘 using Eq . ( 2 ) . A higher specificity score indicates a 559 better - selected topic number . ( ii ) The fewer topics that occur in each bin , the better . 560 Such a measurement was defined as a purity score ( 𝑃𝑆 & ) for all topics under a certain 561 topic number 𝑘 , as calculated in Eq . ( 3 ) . The larger the purity score , the better the 562 selected topic number . Finally , we defined the combination score ( 𝐶𝑆 & ) , which is a 563 weighted average of the specificity score and purity score , as calculated in Eq . ( 4 ) . We 564 selected the optimal topic number from 2 ~ 10 which have the highest combination 565 score . 566 567 The specificity score ( 𝑆𝑆 & ) is calculated as 568 569 𝑆𝑆 & = log @ 1 𝑘 / 𝜎 " 𝜇 " ) & " $ % C ( 2 ) where 𝜎 " and 𝜇 " are the variance and mean , respectively , of the 𝑗 - th column of 𝐺 ( × & . 570 571 The purity score ( 𝑃𝑆 & ) is calculated as 572 𝑃𝑆 & = log D1𝑝 / 𝜎 ! ( ! $ % E ( 3 ) where 𝜎 ! is the variance of 𝑖 - th row of 𝐺 ( × & . 573 574 The combination score ( 𝐶𝑆 & ) is calculated as 575 𝐶𝑆 & = 𝛼𝑆𝑆 & + ( 1 − 𝛼 ) 𝑃𝑆 & ( 4 ) where 𝛼 is calculated as 576 𝛼 = 𝑃𝑆 & 𝑆𝑆 & + 𝑃𝑆 & ( 5 ) 577 After the selection of optimal topic number 𝑘 , CondSigDetector determined 578 component CAPs of each co - occupancy signature based on matrix 𝐺 & × # representing 579 𝑞 CAPs’ occurrence probability in 𝑘 co - occupancy signatures . In each signature , 580 CAPs with higher 𝑧 - score normalized occurrence probability than a certain threshold 581 ( 1 . 3 by default , corresponds to about 90th percentile of the standard normal 582 distribution ) were determined as components of the signature , and 1 - kb bins occupied 583 by more than 80 % of components are defined as signature - positive sites . Co - 584 occupancy signatures with fewer than 3 components and fewer than 200 signature - 585 positive sites are discarded . 586 587 In the third step , CondSigDetector screens out CondSigs from all co - occupancy 588 signatures based on the condensation potential of each signature . To evaluate the 589 condensation potential of each signature , we quantify associations between 590 condensation - related features and signature presence at genome - wide bins by 591 performing ROC analysis . Intuitively , the higher condensation - related feature values 592 of occupancy events at signature - positive bins , the higher condensation potential of 593 the signature . In ROC analysis , the positive set is signature - positive bins and the 594 negative set is signature - negative bins . Signature - positive bins were defined in the 595 first step , and signature - negative bins are defined using the following two criteria : ( i ) 596 The presence of at least 𝑡 CAPs , where 𝑡 = 0 . 8 × component number of the 597 signature ; ( ii ) The absence of any co - occupancy of components , i . e . , count of 598 occupied components of the signature < 2 . For each signature , six condensation - 599 related features are calculated according to co - occupancy events of top 𝑞 CAPs ( see 600 the first step for the definition of top 𝑞 CAPs ) : ( i ) The fraction of occupied CAPs 601 having reported LLPS capacity ; ( ii ) The fraction of occupied CAPs co - occurring in the 602 same MLO ; ( iii ) The fraction of occupied CAPs with predicted IDRs ; ( iv ) The fraction 603 of occupied CAP pairs having protein - protein interactions ; ( v ) The fraction of 604 occupied CAPs predicted as RBPs ; ( vi ) RNA - binding strength of the bin . If at least 3 605 out of 6 condensation - related features exhibit a positive correlation ( AUROC > 0 . 6 ) 606 with the presence of the signature ( mean AUROC of top 3 features > 0 . 65 ) , the 607 signature would be identified as CondSigs . 608 609 Finally , all CondSigs within the same cell type are pooled and any redundant CondSigs 610 are discarded . Redundancy of CondSigs is measured according to the overlapping 611 level of the top 5 components , these components being ranked by their occurrence 612 probability within the CondSig . We calculate a Jaccard index for all CondSigs using 613 pairwise comparisons , and discard those with a low mean AUROC when the Jaccard 614 index > 0 . 25 . The threshold of 0 . 25 corresponds to that 2 out of 5 components are 615 identical in the pairwise CondSigs . 616 617 Comparison of BTM and HDP 618 We built HDP and BTM models on the entire occupancy matrix separately , and 619 compared the quality of learned topics . HDP determines the topic number 620 automatically while BTM asks for a given topic number . So we first built an HDP model 621 and generated k topics , then we built a BTM model to generate topics with the given 622 topic number k . The quality of each learned topic was evaluated by the coherence 623 score of the top 5 words , a common quality evaluation metric in topic model 22 , 59 . HDP 624 modeling was implemented by using a Python package “tomotopy” . 625 626 Clustering of component CAPs 627 We performed a k - means clustering for component CAPs in mESC or K562 according 628 to their potentials for self - assembly ( PS - Self ) or interaction with partners ( PS - Part ) to 629 undergo phase separation . A recent study employed two machine - learning models , 630 SaPS and PdPS model , to estimate proteins’ potentials and provided SaPS and PdPS 631 ranking scores ( ranging from 0 to 1 ) for the human and mouse proteome . We utilized 632 the SaPS and PdPS ranking scores of component CAPs in mESC or K562 to carry 633 out k - means clustering . In the clustering , the number of clusters was set as 4 , and the 634 initial cluster centroids were set as ( 0 . 8 , 0 . 8 ) , ( 0 . 8 , 0 . 4 ) , ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 8 ) , ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 4 ) , which 635 corresponds to four clusters : “both scaffold and client” , “scaffold - only” , “client - only” , 636 and “none” , respectively . 637 638 Annotation for charged amino acid blocks 639 We calculated NCPR ( net charge per residue ) employing a 10 - residue sliding window 640 with a step size of 1 . This calculation factored in both positively charged amino acids 641 ( R , K and H ) and negatively charged amino acids ( D and E ) . Windows with NCPR 642 greater than 0 . 5 or less than - 0 . 5 were defined as charged amino acid blocks , and 643 overlapping blocks were merged . 644 645 Identification of CondSig - positive / negative peaks and domains 646 To identify CondSig - positive / negative peaks for each component CAP , we classified 647 its ChIP - seq peaks into two groups based on overlapping with positive sites of 648 CondSigs which includes the given CAP as a component . To identify CondSig - positive 649 / negative domains , we transformed its peaks into domains by merging adjacent peaks 650 not further than n kb . For component CAPs using narrow peaks as accurate 651 occupancy regions in ChIP - seq data processing procedure , we set n = 5 , and for 652 component CAPs using broad peaks as accurate occupancy regions , we set n = 10 . 653 Then domains of each component CAP were classified into CondSig - positive domains 654 and - negative domains based on overlapping with positive sites of CondSigs which 655 includes the given CAP as a component . 656 657 3D chromatin contact analysis 658 Public Micro - C data in mESC , ChIA - PET data against SMC1 in mESC , and ChIA - PET 659 data against RNA Pol II in K562 were used in this study . Micro - C contact matrices 660 from 2 . 6 billion reads were downloaded from GSE130275 30 , and boundary strength 661 for 400 - bp resolution calculated by Cooltools 60 was used for the following analysis . 662 SMC1 ChIA - PET data in mESC were downloaded from GSE57911 33 and processed 663 with ChIA - PET2 61 . RNA Pol II ChIA - PET loops were directly downloaded from 664 ENCSR880DSH 34 . 665 666 Definition for target genes of CondSig - positive genomic regions 667 For each genomic region , genes whose promoter overlaps with the given region or 668 has long - range chromatin contacts with the given region were defined as target genes . 669 Long - range chromatin contacts were determined by ChIA - PET data in the 670 corresponding cell type . In this study , SMC1 ChIA - PET data in mESC and RNA Pol II 671 ChIA - PET data in K562 were used . 672 673 Cell culture 674 Mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESC ) , C57BL / 6 strain , were purchased from ATCC 675 ( SCRC - 1002 ) and cultured on a feeder layer of mitomycin C ( Stemcell , 73272 ) treated 676 mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) in tissue culture flask coated with 0 . 1 % gelatin . The 677 cells were grown in complete mESC medium , which was composed of EmbryoMax 678 DMEM ( Millipore , SLM - 220 - B ) , 15 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , SH30070 . 03 ) , 679 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids ( Millipore , TMS - 001 - C ) , 1 % ( v / v ) nucleoside 680 ( Millipore , ES - 008 - D ) , 2 mM L - glutamine ( Millipore , TMS - 002 - C ) , 0 . 1 mM β - 681 mercaptoethanol ( Millipore , ES - 007 - E ) , and 1000 U / mL recombinant LIF ( Millipore , 682 ESG1107 ) . 683 684 Cell treatment 685 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( Sigma , 240117 ) was dissolved in a complete mESC medium at a 686 concentration of 15 % ( w / v ) to make a storage solution . mESC were detached using 687 trypsin , pelleted by centrifuging , and then resuspended in a complete mESC 688 medium . The resuspended cells were transferred into a new gelatin - coated flask and 689 cultured in a 37°C incubator for 1hr to remove the feeder cells . The supernatant cells 690 were collected and washed twice with PBS . After cell resuspending with medium , the 691 1 , 6 - hexanediol storage buffer was added at a final concentration of 1 . 5 % . The dish 692 was put into the incubator immediately for 30 min , and treated cells were 693 immediately used for CUT & RUN assay . 694 695 CUT & RUN 696 The CUT & RUN assay was conducted on 0 . 2 million cells per sample , utilizing the 697 Hyperactive pG - MNase CUT & RUN assay kit ( Vazyme , HD102 ) with slight 698 modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , cells were harvested and 699 incubated for 10 min at room temperature with Concanavalin A - coated magnetic 700 beads , which had been activated prior to use . Following this , the ConA beads bound 701 cells were collected using a magnet and resuspended in 100 µl of antibody buffer 702 containing either 2µl of DDX21 ( Proteintech , 10528 - 1 - AP ) , 4 µl of CTR9 ( Novus 703 Biologicals , NB100 - 1718 ) or 4 µl of SUPT6 ( SUPT6H ) ( Novus Biologicals , NB100 - 704 2582 ) primary antibody respectively . The samples were then incubated at 4°C 705 overnight on rotator . The next day , cells were washed twice with Dig - wash buffer and 706 resuspended in 100 µl of a premixed pG - MNase Enzyme solution before incubation 707 at 4°C for 1hr with rotation . Following this , the cells were washed twice with Dig - 708 wash buffer and resuspended in 100 µl of premixed CaCl 2 solution , then incubated 709 for 2hr on ice . Following the stop of the reaction , the cut chromatin was released 710 from cells by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence of agitation . After 711 centrifuging at 13 , 400 g for 5 min , the supernatant was collected , and DNA was 712 purified using FastPure gDNA mini columns . The libraries were prepared using 713 NEBNext Ultra II DNA library prep kit ( NEB , E7645 ) with modified amplification 714 condition as 98 °C for 30 sec , 15 cycles of 98 °C for 10 sec and 65°C for 17 sec , and 715 final extension at 65 °C for 2 min and hold at 4°C . 716 717 Single - cell RNA - seq 718 Single - cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA - seq ) libraries were prepared using 6 , 000 mES 719 cells , either in a wild type state or treatment with 1 , 6 - hexanediol at 1 . 5 % for 2 720 minutes , and K562 cells , either in wild type or treatment with 1 , 6 - hexanediol at 10 % 721 for 20 minutes . The libraries were created using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library 722 and Gel Bead Kit V3 . 1 ( 10x Genomics , Catalog No . PN1000268 ) to create single - cell 723 gel beads in emulsion ( GEM ) . Following preparation , the libraries were sequenced 724 using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform in a 150 bp paired - end mode . 725 726 Immunofluorescence staining 727 CTR9 antibody and SPT6 ( SUPT6H ) antibody were labeled with Mix - n - Stain CF488 728 Antibody labeling kit ( Sigma , MX488AS20 ) and Mix - n - Stain CF568 Antibody labeling 729 kit ( Sigma , MX568S20 ) respectively according to the manufacturer’s instruction . 730 Mouse ES Cells were grown as mentioned above on pre - coated coverslips and fixed 731 with 4 % paraformaldehyde solution ( Beyotime , P0099 ) at room temperature for 10 732 min . permeabilization was performed using 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich , 733 93443 ) in PBS for 10 min . Cells were blocked with IF blocking solution ( Beyotime , 734 P0102 ) for 1 hr at RT , and subsequently incubated with a 1 : 100 diluted SUPT5 735 ( SUPT5H ) primary antibody ( Abcam , ab126592 ) in QuickBlock dilution buffer 736 ( Beyotime , P0262 ) at 4 °C overnight . Following three washes , cells were incubated 737 with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( ThermoFisher , A11037 ) at 738 a concentration of 1 : 1000 in PBST for 1 hr at RT . After three additional washes with 739 PBST , cells were labeled with both CF488 - conjugated CTR9 and CF568 - conjugated 740 SPT6 antibodies at RT for 2hr . After three washes with PBST , the coverslips were 741 mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield medium with DAPI ( Vector 742 Laboratories , H - 1200 ) and sealed with nail polish . Images were acquired using a 743 Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with 100 × oil objective and ZEN acquisition 744 software . 745 746 Western blot 747 Cells were lysed using a lysis buffer ( Beyotime , P0013J ) supplemented with 1 mM 748 PMSF as a protease inhibitor . Cell lysate was run on a 10 % Bis - Tris gel at 70 V for 749 ~ 90 min , followed by 120 V until the dye front reached the end of the gel . Proteins 750 were subsequently dry transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot2 751 western blot transfer system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) under specific conditions : 7 752 min at 20V for CTR9 , and 15 min at 25V for SUPT6H . The membrane was then 753 blocked using 5 % non - fat milk in TBST for 1 hr at room temperature with shaking . 754 Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight on a shaker at 4°C with the 755 following dilutions : 1 : 1 , 000 of anti - CTR9 ( Novus Biologicals , NB100 - 1718 ) and 756 1 : 1000 of anti - GAPDH ( Invitrogen , MA5 - 15738 ) in 5 % non - fat milk , 1 : 1 , 000 of anti - 757 SUPT6 ( Novus Biologicals , NB100 - 2582 ) and 1 : 2000 of anti - lamin B1 ( Beyotime , 758 AF1408 ) in Western dilution buffer ( Beyotime , P0023 ) . The following day , 759 membranes were washed three times with TBST for 10 minutes each at room 760 temperature with shaking . Secondary antibody incubations were carried out for 2 761 hours at room temperature using 1 : 1 , 000 dilutions of goat anti - rabbit IgG - horseradish 762 peroxidase ( HRP ) or goat anti - mouse IgG - HRP ( Beyotime Technology , A0208 , and 763 A0216 , respectively ) in TBST . Following incubation , membranes were washed three 764 times in TBST for 10 minutes each , and protein bands were visualized by 765 chemiluminescence immunoassay . 766 767 CUT & RUN , single - cell RNA - seq data processing 768 CUT & RUN reads were first processed using TrimGalore ( v0 . 6 . 0 ) to trim adaptor and 769 low - quality reads . Trimmed reads were then aligned to the mouse genome build mm10 770 or human genome build hg38 using Bowtie2 ( v2 . 3 . 5 . 1 ) 55 with parameters “ - - no - mixed 771 - - no - discordant - - no - unal” . Low mapping quality reads ( mapping quality < 30 ) and 772 duplicates were discarded . Then biological replicates that passed quality control were 773 pooled together . CUT & RUN peaks were called by MACS2 ( v2 . 1 . 3 ) 48 . Signal tracks 774 were generated using the “genomecov” command in Bedtools software ( v2 . 28 . 0 ) , and 775 normalized to reads per million mapped reads ( RPM ) . Single - cell RNA - seq data ( 10x 776 Genomics ) were processed with DrSeq2 ( v2 . 2 . 0 ) 62 and transcriptome - wide 777 transcriptional burst kinetics were inferred using the model from the previous study 42 . 778 779 Data availability 780 All the CUT & RUN and scRNA - seq data generated in this study have been deposited 781 in Genome Sequence Archive ( https : / / bigd . big . ac . cn / gsa / ) under accession 782 CRAXXXXXX and HRAXXXXXX .
