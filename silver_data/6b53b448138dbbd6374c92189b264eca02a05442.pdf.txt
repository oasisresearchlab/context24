Structural deﬁnition of the F - actin – binding THATCH domain from HIP1R Tom J Brett 1 , Valerie Legendre - Guillemin 3 , Peter S McPherson 3 & Daved H Fremont 1 , 2 Huntingtin - interacting protein - 1 related ( HIP1R ) has a crucial protein - trafﬁcking role , mediating associations between actin and clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane and trans - Golgi network . Here , we characterize the F - actin – binding region of HIP1R , termed the talin - HIP1 / R / Sla2p actin - tethering C - terminal homology ( THATCH ) domain . The 1 . 9 - A˚ crystal structure of the human HIP1R THATCH core reveals a large sequence - conserved surface patch created primarily by residues from the third and fourth helices of a unique ﬁve - helix bundle . Point mutations of seven contiguous patch residues produced signiﬁcant decreases in F - actin binding . We also show that THATCH domains have a conserved C - terminal latch capable of oligomerizing the core , thereby modulating F - actin engagement . Collectively , these results establish a framework for investigating the links between endocytosis and actin dynamics mediated by THATCH domain – containing proteins . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is crucial in diverse cellular functions ranging from nutrient uptake and synaptic transmission to antigen processing and presentation , and it is often pirated by pathogens to gain cellular entry . At the plasma membrane , clathrin assembles into invaginating clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) , which eventually pinch off for intracellular transport of concentrated cargo . This process employs diverse participants , including clathrin triskelia , the heterotetrameric AP - 2 adaptor , phospholipids 1 and a plethora of accessory proteins and additional cargo adaptors 2 , 3 . Much recent attention has focused on emerging links between clathrin - mediated endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton 4 – 6 . In yeast , genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that actin , several F - actin – binding proteins and the Arp2 – Arp3 complex , which activates branched actin assembly , are essential for endocytosis 7 – 9 . A role for actin in endocytosis in mammalian cells is not as concrete , but is becoming more ﬁrmly established . For example , treatment of mam - malian cells with the actin - depolymerizing drug latrunculin A has been observed to inhibit transferrin endocytosis 10 and to shut down all dynamic aspects of clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane 11 . In addition , live - cell imaging has revealed transient interactions between actin and the endocytic machinery at clathrin - coated bud sites during internalization 12 , 13 . Similar observations have been made involving clathrin - mediated budding from the trans - Golgi network , suggesting that actin is involved globally in the formation or trafﬁcking of clathrin - coated vesicles 14 . Furthermore , a number of proteins have been identiﬁed that interact with or regulate actin and either are components of the endocytic machi - nery or are recruited to budding sites , such as actin - binding protein - 1 ( ref . 15 ) , cortactin 16 , syndapin 17 , intersectin - l 18 , myosin VI 19 , N - WASP 20 , Arp2 – Arp3 complex 12 and huntingtin - interacting protein - 1 related ( HIP1R ) 21 . HIP1R ( also called HIP12 ) was ﬁrst discovered on the basis of sequence similarity with HIP1 , a protein identiﬁed through its interaction with huntingtin , the polyglutamine - containing protein associated with Huntington disease . The binding of HIP1 to mutant huntingtin is reduced compared to the binding to wild - type protein , suggesting that a lack of HIP1 - huntingtin interactions may contribute to Huntington disease pathology 22 . In contrast to HIP1 , HIP1R does not directly bind huntingtin 23 . HIP1 and HIP1R have recently been recognized as clathrin coat components 21 , 24 , 25 . They share a similar domain structure ( Fig . 1 ) , but do not have identical interactions with components of the endocytic machinery . Both proteins contain an N - terminal ANTH ( AP180 N - terminal homology ) domain that can bind inositol phospho - lipids 25 , 26 . After the ANTH domain , an unstructured region in HIP1 contains a clathrin - binding motif ( clathrin box ) LMDMD and the AP - 2 – binding FXDXF and DPF motifs 27 ( where X denotes any amino acid residue ) , which mediate the association of HIP1 with clathrin and AP - 2 ( refs . 24 , 25 ) . In contrast , this region of HIP1R contains no AP - 2 – binding motifs and shares weak sequence identity with the clathrin box . Accordingly , this region of HIP1R does not bind AP - 2 and binds clathrin weakly 28 . Both proteins contain a central coiled - coil region that mediates homo - and heterodimerization and engages the clathrin light chain in an important regulatory interaction that stimulates clathrin assembly in vitro 28 – 30 . The C termini of both HIP1 and HIP1R share sequence motifs with the C - terminal F - actin – binding region of the cytoskeletal protein talin 31 , 32 .

In addition , HIP1R ( but not HIP1 ) contains PXXXPR motifs at its extreme C terminus , which mediate binding to CIN85 ( ref . 34 ) , an adaptor protein contain - ing multiple SH3 domains that is also capable of associating with components of the actin cytoskeleton . It was originally recognized that Sla2p ( an HIP1 - and HIP1R - related protein in yeast ) shared sequence similarity with talin in a 200 - residue region located near the C terminus of both proteins 31 . Later , this talin - related region was found to be present in a number of cytosolic and cytoskeletal proteins found in diverse organisms from humans to slime mold ( Fig . 1a , b ) , and a number of these motifs were shown to bind F - actin both in vitro and in vivo 32 . Notably , short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated knockdown of HIP1R in mam - malian cells and genetic knockouts of Sla2p in yeast show that each protein is required for a productive interaction between actin and the endocytic machinery 12 , 35 , with the talin - related regions providing functions important for fulﬁlling their roles in endocytosis 12 , 36 . Given the importance of this region of HIP1R in providing a productive link between the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic machinery , we have undertaken its structural and biochemical characterization . We have analyzed this region of HIP1 and HIP1R by limited proteolysis and found that the structural domain boundaries are not deﬁned solely by sequence conservation , and hence we call this module the talin - HIP1 / R / Sla2p actin - tethering C - terminal homology ( THATCH ) domain ( HIP1 / R / Sla2p denotes similarity of Sla2p to HIP1 and HIP1R ) . We have determined the 1 . 9 - A˚ crystal structure of the core fragment of the HIP1R THATCH domain , and on the basis of these results we have identiﬁed a conserved surface patch essential for actin recognition . RESULTS Structural dissection of THATCH domain by proteolysis We initiated our structural studies using C - terminal fragments from human HIP1 ( residues 731 – 1003 ) and HIP1R ( 765 – 1068 ) that had shown differential binding to F - actin 28 . However , crystallization studies with these constructs were not fruitful , so limited proteolysis was pursued to better deﬁne structurally ordered domain boundaries . Exposure of the approximately 35 - kDa HIP1 and HIP1R C - terminal constructs to proteases produced stable fragments of approximately 22 kDa . These fragments were identiﬁed by mass spectrometry and N - terminal sequencing as HIP1 residues 737 – 937 and HIP1R residues 771 – 971 ( Fig . 1b ) .

The proteolysis - resistant fragment identiﬁed here thus contains approximately 50 residues N - terminal of the original boundary of the talin - related domain ( Fig . 1a ) . This N - terminal region has very low overall sequence conservation ( Fig . 1a ) ; however , secondary structure predictions ( Jpred2 ; http : / / www . compbio . dundee . ac . uk / ~ www - jpred ) of all related proteins sug - gest that it is potentially a conserved helix . The proteolysis - resistant fragments lack a highly sequence - conserved region from the C terminus ( residues 974 – 1012 of HIP1R ) that was originally con - sidered as part of the talin - related region and that we now refer to as the ‘latch’ ( see below ) . In this text , we refer to the protease - deﬁned fragment as the THATCH core , and the core plus the conserved C - terminal latch region is deﬁned as the THATCH domain ( Fig . 1a ) . Structure of the HIP1R THATCH domain core Crystals of the HIP1R THATCH core were readily obtained . The structure was determined by X - ray crystallography using MAD ( Fig . 2a ) . The ﬁnal model , composed of HIP1R residues 773 – 962 , has an R - factor of 22 . 4 % ( R free ¼ 26 . 9 % ) to 1 . 9 - A ˚ resolution . There are eight molecules in the asymmetric unit , which are all fairly similar , showing only deviations in the conformations of a few side chains ( r . m . s . deviation of C a overlays range from 0 . 14 to 0 . 52 A˚ ) . The THATCH core has an all – a - helical structure , composed of ﬁve long down - up - down - up - down antiparallel helices connected by short loops and one short connecting helix ( a 3 ¢ ) arranged in a progressive topology ( Fig . 2b , c ) . The core consists of a non – sequence - conserved helix , a 1 ( 0 % identity , 14 % similarity ) , followed by four sequence - conserved helices ( a 2 – a 5 ; 11 % identity , 47 % similarity ) . The domain has an elliptical rod shape approximately 68 A˚ tall with widths of 36 and 29 A˚ . The ﬁrst two helices ( a 1 and a 2 ) are the longest , being about 53 A˚ ( 36 residues ) and 60 A˚ ( 40 residues ) long , respectively . Capping a 2 is a type II ¢ b - turn from Arg853 to Ala856 , with NH1 of the Arg853 side chain donating a turn - stabilizing hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Ala856 . This turn seems to be structurally conserved as shown by sequence analysis , as a hydrogen bond – donating side chain is conserved at the i position of the turn with three small residues following ( Fig . 1a ) . After the turn is a short connecting helix ( a 3 ¢ ) . Sequence analyses suggest that this helix is probably conserved in HIP1 , HIP1R and Sla2p , but it is absent in talins and talin homologs . The 44 - A˚ - long a 3 ( 30 residues ) contains the greatest number of invariant residues ( seven ; Fig . 2b ) . Helix a 4 is the shortest in the core bundle ( 40 A˚ ; 23 residues ) and is connected to a 5 ( 44 A˚ ; 31 residues ) by a 10 - residue loop . Comparison of THATCH core and other all - helical bundles We searched for structural relatives of the THATCH core using Dali 37 . Although helical bundles are fairly common , ﬁve - helix bundles are uncommon , and only two were found that had a size and shape similar to THATCH : vinculin tail 38 and apolipophorin III 39 a c d e b Gln858 Lys864 Lys922Leu932 N N C C C N N Tyr900 Leu895 Ala811 Gly814 C C HIP1R THATCH core compared with vinculin tail HIP1R THATCH core compared with apolipophorin III N C C N N C α 1 α 1 α 1 α 3 α 3 α 3 α 2 α 2 α 2 HIP1R THATCH core Vinculin tail Apolipophorin III α 5 α 5 α 5 α 4 α 4 α 3 α 1 α 2 α 5 α 4 α 4 Asp962 Leu779 N Arg853 Ser866 α 3 ′ α 3 α 2 α 1 α 4 α 5 Figure 2 Crystal structure of the HIP1R THATCH domain core .

Although all three are down - up - down - up - down helical bundles , the precise topologies are quite different . The ﬁve helices of the THATCH core are assembled progressively , in contrast to the circular connectivity of vinculin tail and the crossover connectivity of apolipophorin III ( Fig . 2c – e ) . Where the structures diverge most is in the location of a 1 , which for THATCH lies on an opposite face of the well - overlapping central four - helix bundle as compared to the other two . Thus , our structural analysis indicates that the THATCH core has a novel ﬁve - helix bundle arrangement . The most interesting structural relative of the THATCH domain is the vinculin tail , which is also an F - actin – binding domain . Like the THATCH domain in talin , it is found at the C terminus of a cytoskeletal protein , vinculin . Vinculin tail seems to undergo a conformational change upon F - actin binding , as detected by increased proteolysis in the presence of actin 38 . We have undertaken analogous experiments that indicate the HIP1R THATCH domain is not more proteolytically sensitive upon binding F - actin . Indeed , limited proteolysis studies of HIP1R 765 – 1068 in the presence and absence of actin produced identical fragmentation patterns as assessed by SDS - PAGE ( data not shown ) . Latch oligomerization modulates F - actin binding We next sought to identify the major THATCH region involved in F - actin binding . Cosedimentation assays were carried out with the HIP1R THATCH domain as well as with the core and latch ( Fig . 3 ) . The HIP1R THATCH domain incubated with increasing concentrations of F - actin sediments with actin after ultracentrifuga - tion . Surprisingly , HIP1R core shows little or no sedimentation ( Fig . 3 ) . These observations were corroborated by immunoﬂuores - cence studies in HeLa cells where Flag - tagged HIP1R THATCH was colocalized with F - actin , whereas tagged HIP1R core was much more diffuse and showed little F - actin colocalization ( data not shown ) . Thus the HIP1R core alone seems to bind F - actin quite poorly , if at all . We then focused our attention on the latch region . As with the HIP1R core , the HIP1R latch did not cosediment with F - actin ( Fig . 3 ) . The latch region shows a high degree of sequence conservation ( 10 % identity , 38 % conservation ; Fig . 1a ) , and in many THATCH domain sequences this region is strongly predicted both to adopt a helical conformation and to mediate coiled - coil interactions . In fact , CD spectroscopy of the full HIP1R THATCH domain indicates the latch region is indeed a - helical ( data not shown ) . We observed that the HIP1R THATCH domain ( molecular weight B 33 kDa ) eluted from analytical gel ﬁltration columns at a calibrated molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa , consistent with elongated dimers or trimeric species . In contrast , the HIP1R core ( molecular weight ¼ 22 kDa ) eluted at a much larger volume , consistent with a monomeric species ( calibrated molecular weight ¼ 28 kDa ) ( Fig . 3d ) . Moreover , in pull - down assays , glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - fused HIP1R THATCH bound His 6 - tagged HIP1R THATCH but not His 6 - tagged HIP1R core ( data not shown ) . Thus , the proteolytically releasable THATCH domain latch can mediate oligomerization of THATCH domains , possibly as dimers , and this seems to enhance the a d e f b c 0 2 . 5 5 10 20 Actin ( µ g ) 0 20 Actin ( µ g ) Actin Actin GST – HIP1R core GST – HIP1R core HIP1R THATCH HIP1R THATCH HIP1R core HIP1R THATCH HIP1R latch HIP1R core GST – HIP1R core HIP1R THATCH HIP1R core GST Actin Actin Actin HIP1R THATCH HIP1R THATCH 765 504540353025201510500 1 . 2 1 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 Elution volume ( ml ) N o r m a li z ed ab s o r ban c e l og M W R e s pon s e 85 90 95 100 200 200 µ M HIP1RTHATCH F - actin 200 µ M 200 µ M 10075504020 10 150 100 50 – 50 – 50 50 150 250 350 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 50 6 4 2 0 80 40 120 160 200 100 150 200 0 6 5 . 5 5 4 . 5 4 2 4 6 8 10 Actin ( µ g ) Concentration ( µ M ) R eq R eq / c on c ( × 10 6 ) R eq Time ( s ) % p r o t e i n bound t o F - a c t i n 12 14 16 18 20 771 972 1014 1068 971 HIP1R core HIP1R latch HIP1R core HIP1R latch S P S P S P S P S P S P S P GST – HIP1R core Actin Figure 3 HIP1R THATCH core binds F - actin to a lesser extent than HIP1R THATCH owing to loss of oligomerization through the THATCH domain latch .

Accordingly , GST – HIP1R core fusion proteins , in which oligomerization via the latch region has been replaced by dimerization via GST , are able to cosediment with F - actin , albeit with a weaker association than observed for latch - mediated oligomers ( Fig . 3a – c ) . In a control experiment , GST alone showed no binding to F - actin under these conditions ( Fig . 3b ) . To estimate the afﬁnity of HIP1R THATCH constructs for F - actin , we developed a surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) assay . In this assay , F - actin was immobilized on a sensor chip while the various constructs were ﬂowed over . To correct for nonspeciﬁc interactions , the response curves were corrected by subtraction of response curves of the same samples ﬂowed over a G - actin – coupled ﬂow cell . Biphasic kinetic ﬁts indicated that approximate saturation was reached ; however , the dissociation constants derived from our SPR analysis are best inter - preted qualitatively ( see Methods ) . HIP1R THATCH was observed to bind F - actin with an estimated K d ( approximated from equilibrium analysis ) of 36 . 4 m M , in good agreement with a recent cosedimentation study 40 , whereas HIP1R core did not detectably bind ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Consistent with the cosedimentation results , fusion of HIP1R core to dimeric GST resulted in a construct whose binding to F - actin was detectable by SPR ( Fig . 3e ) . In summary , our data collectively imply that the main F - actin – binding surface of the THATCH domain is located in the core region . The THATCH latch may modulate this F - actin – binding ability by mediating oligomerization of THATCH domains , although other roles are possible . Identiﬁcation of the THATCH actin - binding surface To identify the potential F - actin – binding region on the THATCH core , we undertook a computational analysis of the structure .

It has recently been hypothesized that many F - actin – binding proteins bind the same hydrophobic cleft on the surface of F - actin 41 . Also , given the high degree of sequence identity among actin sequences from diverse species ( yeast and vertebrate actin are 87 % identical ) , sequence - conserved patches on binding partners probably mediate this interaction 41 . Examination of THATCH - domain sequences from various species ( Fig . 1a ) in the framework of the structure reveals that many of the conserved residues are buried ( Fig . 2b ) and are presumably involved in interactions that establish the fold of the domain . Notably , many of the conserved residues that are surface exposed are clustered on a single face of the THATCH core , emanating primarily from helices a 3 and a 4 ( Fig . 4b ) . In addition , varied constructs that contain this section from diverse THATCH family members such as HIP1 , HIP1R , Sla2p , ﬁlopodin and talin have all been shown to bind F - actin 28 , 31 , 32 , 40 . Given the substantial size of this highly conserved region , we postulated that this surface mediates interactions with F - actin . Other surface properties support the likelihood of this patch being involved in engaging F - actin ( Fig . 4 ) . Past studies of F - actin – binding domains suggest that their F - actin – binding surfaces contain hydro - phobic regions lined by some basic residues . The highly conserved patch on a 3 and a 4 has such an appearance , as it is lined by conserved basic residues ( Lys922 , Lys924 and Arg867 ) and contains many hydrophobic residues . In addition , mapping of the contiguous hydro - phobic patches using QUILT 42 indicates that a portion of this region ( including part of invariant Gln916 ) is included in the largest such patch detected . The lone outstanding electrostatic feature on the HIP1R core surface is a narrow strip of acidic residues winding across the faces of a 1 , a 3 , a 4 and a 5 . Given that the surface of F - actin is very acidic , it is unlikely that this acidic stretch on the THATCH core is involved in direct binding to F - actin , and it may serve to properly orient the sequence - conserved patch . To establish whether or not the conserved THATCH surface patch is involved in F - actin binding , we performed F - actin – binding assays using site - directed mutants . We focused on several invariant and conserved residues within the patch on the a 3 and a 4 helices ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . A total of nine HIP1R THATCH variants were prepared . All the soluble puriﬁed variants were observed to migrate in gel ﬁltration chromatography experiments similarly to the wild - type construct ( B 90 - kDa elution ) . Further , GST fusions of each mutant were able to pull down His 6 - tagged HIP1R THATCH ( data 200 150 100 50 – 50 – 50 50 150 250 Time ( s ) HIP1R construct THATCH WT THATCH R867D THATCH G871D THATCH S874D THATCH A875D THATCH Q916E THATCH K922D THATCH V923D THATCH K924D THATCH KVK DDD 36 ± 7 630 ± 130 320 ± 180 430 ± 100 248 ± 41 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + – + + + – – > 1 , 000 * > 1 , 000 * CoreLatch ND GST - core ND ND ND ND ND CosedimentationPellet SPR K d ( µ M ) R e s pon s e 350 WT WT 0 S S S S S P P P P K924D R867D V923D K922D G871D A875D Q916E S874D N P 2 . 5 5 10 20 40 % p r o t e i n bound t o F - a c t i n 30 20 10 0 0 5 10 Actin ( µ g ) THATCH Phosphoinositolphospholipids AP - 2 Clathrin F - actin CIN85 H I P 1 A N T H A N T H CC S H 3 S H 3 S H 3 CC CC La t c h H I P 1 R C o r e C o r e β 2 µ 2 α α 2 α 1 α 3 α 4 α 5 σ 2 15 20 Actin ( µ g ) Actin Actin HIP1R THATCH HIP1R THATCH KVK DDD V923DG871DK922DA875D S874D K922D KVK DDD 0 KVK DDD α 3 ′ α 5 α 4 α 3 a d b e f c Figure 5 Mutational analysis of the HIP1R THATCH domain reveals an F - actin – binding surface .

HIP1R THATCH variants having single - point mutations G871D and A875D on the a 3 helix and K922D and V923D on the a 4 helix were observed by SPR to bind with 7 - to 17 - fold lower afﬁnities compared to the wild - type protein ( Fig . 5a , d ) . Similar results for these variants were observed in cosedimentation assays , which further indicated that R867D , S874D and K924D mutations reduced F - actin binding as well ( Fig . 5d ) . Although many of the single - point mutant HIP1R THATCH domains ( with the exception of Q916E ) showed marked decreases in F - actin binding , none were null binders . As the point mutations K922D , V923D and K924D each resulted in strong reduction of F - actin binding , we designed a triple mutant . Indeed , the HIP1R THATCH 922 - Lys - Val - Lys - 924 - 922 - Asp - Asp - Asp - 924 triple mutant showed no binding to F - actin in SPR experiments ( Fig . 5a ) and severely decreased binding in cosedimentation experiments ( Fig . 5b , c ) . Collectively , our computational and subsequent muta - tional analyses of conserved - patch residues indicate that this surface is important in F - actin binding by THATCH domains . Further , the C - terminal latch seems to modulate this F - actin – binding potential by mediating oligomerization of THATCH domains . DISCUSSION In this report , we have deﬁned the structure - based boundaries and actin - binding surface of the THATCH domain , a unique F - actin – binding module . In total , mutations of seven clustered residues in the single sequence - conserved patch on a 3 and a 4 of the core lead to diminished F - actin binding . Notably , many of these patch residues are similar to equivalent positions on a 4 and a 5 of the structurally similar vinculin tail . Most noteworthy are Arg867 ( equivalent to Lys975 in vinculin tail ) , Val923 ( Ile1046 in vinculin tail ) and Lys924 ( Lys1047 in vinculin tail ) , variants of which generate decreased F - actin binding for THATCH . These three residues seem to be conserved in vinculin sequences 38 , suggesting that an analogous surface on a 4 and a 5 of vinculin tail could mediate binding to F - actin . Although they share a fairly high sequence similarity , HIP1 and HIP1R have evolved a number of divergent functions , including varied interactions with huntingtin , clathrin , AP - 2 , CIN85 and cortactin as well as different capacities for nuclear localization 43 and actin association . The conserved - patch residues important for F - actin binding in HIP1R are shared by HIP1 , suggesting that other residues outside the patch or core region could modulate the actin - binding potential of THATCH domain – containing proteins . An intriguing feature of the THATCH domain is the role of the C - terminal latch region , as it seems to modulate the F - actin – binding ability of THATCH domains by mediating their oligomerization . Given that we have made our observations using isolated THATCH domains , one question is whether latch interactions are functional in the context of the full - length protein . Recent quick - freeze deep - etch EM studies show that HIP1R exists as an elongated rod - shaped parallel homodimer 33 . At either end of the central rod ( which corresponds to the central coiled - coil regions ) are pairs of globular domains . In multiple images , the larger globular domains seem to lie in random positions , whereas the smaller pair of globular domains tend to lie side by side . Given the larger size and more spherical shape of the ANTH domain , it is logical to conclude that the smaller spheres are the THATCH domains . Thus , it is plausible that the side - by - side orientation of the smaller globular domains happens because of latch interactions occurring in the context of full - length HIP1R . The major mediator of homo - and heterodimerization of HIP1 and HIP1R is their central coiled - coil regions . Thus , the THATCH latch could operate to zipper together THATCH domains , optimizing or mod - ulating the actin - binding ability of HIP1 and HIP1R homo - and heterodimers ( for example , see Figure 5f ) . The latch could self - oligomerize or , alternatively , mediate domain - swapping contacts with the core . It is also possible that clustering of THATCH domains from different central coiled - coil – mediated dimers could occur , creating large networks of HIP1 and HIP1R laced together via THATCH latches . Additionally , although we observed no direct binding for the latch to F - actin , it remains possible that residues in the latch could contribute cooperatively to binding beyond their role in oligomerization . Recent studies suggest that the THATCH domain has an important role in linking actin dynamics to the receptor - mediated endocytic machinery . For example , siRNA knockdowns of HIP1R 12 and genetic knockouts of Sla2p 35 show similar phenotypes where the endocytic machinery associates with cortical actin patches but remains stagnant on the membrane . Additionally , overexpression of an HIP1R trunca - tion mutant lacking the THATCH domain shows the same phenotype , indicating that the THATCH domain is required to regulate a productive and transient association between the endocytic machinery and actin patches 12 . Furthermore , this important role is required not only at the plasma membrane but also in clathrin - mediated budding from the trans - Golgi network 14 . These observations have also been made in yeast , where the THATCH domain of Sla2p has an integral role in endocytosis and actin organization 36 . These results collectively show that the THATCH domain is crucial in receptor - mediated endocytosis by virtue of its F - actin – binding capacity , although addi - tional functions for this domain are certainly possible . The properties of many accessory proteins suggest they may act as cargo - speciﬁc adaptors that work independently of or in cooperation with AP - 2 . Epsin , AP180 , b - arrestin , Dab2 and ARH have all been shown to bind AP - 2 , clathrin and PIP 2 ( refs . 44 – 48 ) . Furthermore , there is evidence that some of these proteins may cluster speciﬁc cell - surface receptors into CCPs . For example , Dab2 ( ref . 47 ) and ARH 48 can bind NPXY motifs found in the LDL receptor family . The HIP1 - HIP1R heterodimer may also act as a receptor - speciﬁc adaptor , as it binds AP - 2 , clathrin and PIP 2 ( Fig . 5f ) and has recently been observed to mediate the recruitment of neuronal glutamate receptors to CCPs 49 . Additionally , it provides a direct link between the endocytic machinery and the actin cytoskeleton via the THATCH domain . The structural and biochemical studies presented here provide a framework for investigating this crucial link . METHODS DNA constructs and recombinant proteins . GST – HIP1 THATCH ( residues 731 – 1003 ) and GST – HIP1R THATCH ( residues 765 – 1068 ) were previously described 28 . GST – HIP1 core ( residues 740 – 937 ) and GST – HIP1R core ( resi - dues 771 – 971 ) , as well as GST – HIP1R THATCH point mutants R867D , G871D , S874D , A875D , Q916E , K922D , V923D and K924D and triple mutant 922 - Lys - Val - Lys - 924 - 922 - Asp - Asp - Asp - 924 , were generated by PCR ampliﬁ - cation from either human full - length HIP1 or HIP1R complementary DNAs and then cloned into pGEX - 4T - 1 ( Pharmacia ) . His 6 – HIP1 THATCH , His 6 – HIP1R THATCH , His 6 – HIP1 core and His 6 – HIP1R core were generated similarly and then cloned into pTrcHisB vector ( Pharmacia ) . Flag – HIP1R THATCH and Flag – HIP1R core were generated by digestion of the appropriate fragment from GST – HIP1R THATCH and GST – HIP1R core , respectively , then cloned into pCMV - Tag2C and pCMV - Tag2B , respectively ( Invitrogen ) . All constructs were conﬁrmed by sequencing . GST - and His 6 - fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) ( Stratagene ) and puriﬁed using afﬁnity columns ( Pharmacia and Qiagen , respectively ) . Limited proteolysis . The C - terminal portions of HIP1 ( residues 731 – 1003 ) and HIP1R ( residues 765 – 1068 ) ( each at 0 . 5 mg ml – 1 ) were subjected to proteolysis A R T I C L E S NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2006 127 © 2006 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n s m b by a - chymotrypsin , trypsin , elastase and subtilisin at 37 1 C in 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) with 10 mM CaCl 2 . For each protease , three reactions were run with different concentrations of the protease ( 0 . 02 mg ml – 1 , 0 . 01 mg ml – 1 and 0 . 002 mg ml – 1 ) . At speciﬁc times throughout the 60 minute reaction , an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed , treated with PMSF ( 1 mM ) and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . In most cases , both the HIP1 and HIP1R C - terminal constructs were digested to a fragment of 22 kDa . The a - chymotrypsin proteolytic fragments were analyzed further . N - terminal sequencing revealed two different overlapping N termini for both the HIP1 and HIP1R C - terminal proteolytic fragments ( HIP1 , 737 - GLDIK y and 740 - IKQEE y ; HIP1R , 771 - SLDVR y and 773 - DVRQE y ) . The C termini of the proteolytic fragments were estab - lished by mass spectroscopy ( ES - TOF ) , which produced most abundant peaks of 21 , 265 Da for HIP1 and 21 , 825 Da for HIP1R . This determined the boundaries of the a - chymotrypsin proteolytic fragments ( the THATCH domain structural core ) to be HIP1 residues 737 – 937 ( calculated molecular weight 21 , 268 Da ) and HIP1R residues 771 – 971 ( calculated molecular weight 21 , 828 Da ) . Protein expression and puriﬁcation . HIP1 core and HIP1R core GST fusions were relieved of GST using thrombin cleavage and puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration chromatography as described below . The puriﬁed proteins were exchanged into a buffer of 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) and 10 mM NaCl and concentrated to 10 mg ml – 1 before crystallization . Both proteins were screened for crystal - lization , but conditions were found for only the HIP1R core . Selenomethionine ( SeMet ) - substituted HIP1R core was prepared after transforming the pGEX construct into the methionine auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) RP - X ( Stratagene ) . A starter culture ( 50 ml ) in modiﬁed LeMasters medium containing 50 m g ml – 1 L - SeMet was used to inoculate a large - scale ( 2 l ) culture in the same medium . Complete replacement of the ﬁve methionines by SeMet was quantitated by electrospray mass spectrometry . Crystallization , data collection and structure determination . Crystals of HIP1R core formed by hanging drop vapor diffusion using 1 m l of protein solution ( at 10 mg ml – 1 ) mixed with 1 m l of precipitant buffer ( 1 . 75 M ammonium sulfate with 5 % ( v / v ) ethylene glycol ) . Crystals formed over the course of 1 to 2 weeks at 293 K . For data collection , crystals were ﬂash - cooled and cryo - preserved at B 100 K in a cryo - protectant having 30 % ( v / v ) ethylene glycol in the precipitant solution . Data were collected by the oscillation method in our laboratory ( SeMet high - resolution data set , Table 1 ) and at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 19ID ( MAD data , Table 1 ) . Diffraction intensities were integrated and scaled using the HKL suite 50 . Crystallographic data processed equally well in the space groups C 2 ( a ¼ 148 . 2 , b ¼ 165 . 9 , c ¼ 109 . 8 A˚ , b ¼ 132 . 4 1 ) and F 222 ( a ¼ 148 . 0 , b ¼ 161 . 9 , c ¼ 165 . 5 A˚ ) , apparently owing to pseudo symmetry , as F 222 structure determination and reﬁnement were problematic . The phase problem was solved by MAD using monoclinic processed data . SHELXD 51 was used to locate 32 of the 40 selenium sites . Subsequent heavy - atom reﬁnement and phasing was carried out in SHARP 52 , during which six of the eight remaining sites were located . The ﬁnal phasing powers at the peak wavelength were 1 . 915 / 2 . 026 ( acentric / centric ) , and the anomalous phasing power and R culllis were 1 . 437 and 0 . 670 , respectively . Corresponding values at the inﬂection wavelength were 2 . 107 / 2 . 778 , 0 . 837 and 0 . 806 . After density modiﬁcation using SOLO - MON 53 , the map was of excellent quality and ARP / wARP 54 was able to automatically trace most of all eight molecules in the asymmetric unit . Map - view - ing and model - building were performed using O 55 , and reﬁnement and water placement using CNS 56 . The ﬁrst two and the last nine residues were not located . The ﬁnal Ramachan - dran plot showed 94 . 5 % of residues in most favored regions and 4 . 3 % in additional allowed , 1 . 2 % in generously allowed and none in disallowed regions . The cross - validated Luzzati error is 0 . 32 A˚ . Final data collection and reﬁnement statistics are shown in Table 1 . Actin binding assays . Puriﬁed human nonmuscle actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) was polymerized according to the manufacturer’s instructions and used for sedi - mentation assays . Puriﬁed proteins ( 4 or 8 m g ) were incubated with increasing amounts of F - actin ( 0 – 20 m g ) or a maximal dose in a total volume of 50 m l for 1 h at room temperature . The samples were then centrifuged for 25 min at a maximum force of 362 , 000 g at room temperature . Supernatants and pellets were analyzed on Coomassie blue – stained SDS - PAGE gels . Gels were scanned and levels of proteins were quantiﬁed using ImageQuant software . Gel ﬁltration analysis . A Superdex 200 gel ﬁltration column ( 16 / 60 ; Amersham Biosciences ) used at a ﬂow rate of 1 . 0 ml min – 1 was calibrated using ribonuclease A ( 13 . 7 kDa ) , chymotrypsinogen A ( 25 kDa ) , ovalbumin ( 43 kDa ) , albumin ( 67 kDa ) , aldolase ( 158 kDa ) , catalase ( 232 kDa ) and ferritin ( 440 kDa ) . HIP1R THATCH and HIP1R core as well as all the HIP1R THATCH mutants were run under these same conditions . In all cases , the column buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT . SPR analysis . Biomolecular interaction analyses were carried out at 25 1 C in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 005 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 using a Biacore 2000 . The surface of a CM5 sensorchip was activated with 35 m l of 100 mM N - ethyl - N ¢ - ( dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide hydro - chloride and 400 mM N - hydroxysuccinimide at a ﬂow rate of 5 m l min – 1 . For protein immobilization , F - actin was prepared at 0 . 5 mg ml – 1 in a buffer of Table 1 Data collection , phasing and reﬁnement statistics for the HIP1R THATCH core MAD data Data collection Space group C 2 Cell dimensions a , b , c ( A˚ ) 142 . 2 , 165 . 9 , 109 . 8 b ( 1 ) 132 . 4 Peak Inﬂection Remote High Wavelength 1 . 5418 0 . 97954 0 . 97967 1 . 0332 0 . 96430 Resolution ( A˚ ) 20 – 1 . 9 ( 1 . 97 – 1 . 90 ) a 50 – 2 . 1 ( 2 . 18 – 2 . 10 ) 50 – 2 . 1 ( 2 . 18 – 2 . 10 ) 50 – 2 . 1 ( 2 . 18 – 2 . 10 ) 50 – 2 . 1 ( 2 . 18 – 2 . 10 ) R sym ( % ) 4 . 3 ( 43 . 3 ) 6 . 5 ( 40 . 1 ) 6 . 9 ( 45 . 1 ) 5 . 8 ( 36 . 7 ) 6 . 8 ( 45 . 2 ) I / s I 23 . 5 ( 2 . 4 ) 17 . 1 ( 2 . 7 ) 16 . 1 ( 2 . 5 ) 15 . 5 ( 2 . 4 ) 16 . 8 ( 2 . 6 ) Completeness ( % ) 95 . 7 ( 95 . 2 ) 96 . 4 ( 98 . 3 ) 96 . 5 ( 98 . 3 ) 94 . 0 ( 96 . 0 ) 96 . 4 ( 98 . 0 ) Redundancy 4 . 5 8 . 7 8 . 7 8 . 9 8 . 7 Reﬁnement Resolution ( A˚ ) 20 – 1 . 9 ( 2 . 02 – 1 . 90 ) No . reﬂections 147 , 170 R work / R free 22 . 4 / 26 . 9 ( 34 . 6 / 37 . 9 ) No . atoms Protein 11 , 596 Water 1 , 149 B - factors Protein 36 . 7 Water 43 . 8 R . m . s . deviations Bond lengths ( A˚ ) 0 . 010 Bond angles ( 1 ) 1 . 2 a Highest - resolution shell is shown in parentheses .

A control ﬂow cell was derivatized with the same buffer in the absence of F - actin . A second control cell was coated with G - actin , to correct for possible nonspeciﬁc binding . For this cell , G - actin was prepared at 0 . 5 mg ml – 1 in a buffer of 50 mM sodium acetate ( pH 4 . 1 ) , 0 . 05 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 05 mM ATP and 0 . 125 mM DTT , and 4 m l was applied at a ﬂow rate of 5 m l min – 1 . For G - actin immobilization , the running buffer was switched to 5 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM CaOAc 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 0 . 005 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 . In all cases , the sensorchip was deactivated with 35 ml of 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM ethanolamine hydrochloride , 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 at a ﬂow rate of 5 m l min – 1 . For the F - actin and G - actin ﬂow cells , this process immobilized about 3 , 000 response units of protein . Binding studies were carried out at a ﬂow rate of 60 m l min – 1 . Samples were exchanged into the running buffer before injection . The dissociation constants listed in Figure 5d were derived from nonlinear ﬁts of R eq versus analyte concentration plots as shown in Figure 3f . Sensogram data were analyzed using a simple 1 : 1 Langmuir binding model because of the absence of detailed information regarding the stoichiometry of complex formation ; this approximation for SPR analysis is commonly applied to complex systems such as antibody - antigen interactions 57 . Owing to the slow association of HIP1R THATCH with F - actin , long injection times were required to achieve analyte protein binding saturation , a problem more pronounced for the structure - based mutants whose binding was disrupted . To establish that saturation had indeed been reached , the R eq values taken from the very end of the association phase were compared with R eq values extra - polated from biphasic kinetic ﬁts of the response curves . At most concentra - tions these values were within 3 % of the experimentally measured values , conﬁrming that saturation had nearly been achieved . Thus , dissociation constants derived from our SPR analysis are best interpreted qualitatively . Accession codes . Protein Data Bank : Coordinates have been deposited with accession code 1R0D .
