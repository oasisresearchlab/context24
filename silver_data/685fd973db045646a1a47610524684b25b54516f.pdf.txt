These receptors inﬂuence the actin cytoskeletal network by controlling its assembly at the junctions . Likewise , the actin cytoskeleton is required for cad - herin integrity at cell – cell contacts . The junctional cytoskeleton is intrinsically dynamic and undergoes constant assembly and reorganisation to maintain a morphologically stable structure . This is governed by a host of molecular players that regulate actin assembly during nucleation and at post - nucleation stages .

Introduction 1 . 1 . Classical cadherin receptors Cadherins are single - pass transmembrane glycoprotein recep - tors that function in calcium - dependent cell – cell adhesion , a fundamental process for the maintenance of tissue organisation in multicellular organisms . The classical cadherins are composed of ∼ 20 family members including E - , N - and VE - cadherin which are predominantly expressed in epithelial , neuronal and endothelial tissues , respectively [ 1 ] . Cadherins are major components of adherens junctions ( AJ ) , molecular complexes that regulate cell – cell adhesion . They possess an extracellular region that facilitates homophilic ligation with cadherins presented on adjacent cells while their intracellular cytoplasmic tail interacts with many proteins , of which the best characterised are known as catenins . The cadherin juxtamem - brane cytoplasmic region interacts with p120 - catenin [ 2 ] and the carboxy - terminal end binds directly to (cid:3) - catenin [ 3 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . (cid:3) - Catenin in turn binds (cid:2) - catenin , which can exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms ; at least in vitro , the monomer binds (cid:3) - catenin and not actin while conversely , the dimer associates with actin and not (cid:3) - catenin [ 4 , 5 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . This cadherin – catenin com - plex also acts as a signalling platform and though association with various molecules including actin regulators , results in interactions with the cellular cytoskeleton . Indeed , it should be emphasised that the cadherin cytoplasmic tail can associate , directly or indi - rectly , with many proteins other than the ‘core’ catenins , through interactions that are likely to be dynamic and regulated ( Fig . 1 ) . While the cytoskeletal structures such as actin , microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments have all been observed at cadherin junctions and implicated in regulating its function [ 6 – 8 ] , much research so far has focused on the functional interplay between cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton . To date , the junctional cytoskeleton has been most extensively characterised in simple epithelia . Accordingly , this review will focus mainly on our current understanding of the mechanisms of actin assembly at E - cadherin - mediated contacts and the molecular players that regulate this process in the context of epithelial cells , and , at the end , drawing broader implications for its impact on cell and tissue morphogen - esis in other model systems . 2 . Cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton - functional interplay 2 . 1 . Actin dynamics at cadherin contacts in epithelial cells In mature contacts of simple epithelia , cadherin accumulates at the apical region , characteristically as a ring - like structure known as the zonula adherens ( ZA ) , and is also distributed along the lat - eral surface [ 9 ] . F - actin similarly concentrates at the apical region where it forms prominent circumferential rings [ 10 – 12 ] . In addi - tion , a second pool of actin ﬁlaments can be found at the adhesive cortex [ 12 , 13 ] . Junctional accumulation of F - actin is also seen in epithelial tissues as documented in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos [ 14 , 15 ] . The junctional actin cytoskeleton , notably the perijunctional actin rings observed in epithelial contacts , appear to be a mor - phologically stable . However , there is increasing evidence that it is highly dynamic . Data from ﬂuorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ( FRAP ) experiments revealed a fast actin turnover at the cell – cell contacts with half - lives of around 10 – 50 s [ 5 , 12 ] . More - over , the actin recovery was approximately 80 % indicating that the majority of junctional actin participates in a constant cycle of polymerisation and disassembly [ 5 , 12 ] . Actin assembly at the junctions is thought to occur in distinct stages : commencing with actin nucleation , ﬁlament elongation , followed by post - nucleation remodelling which includes cross - linking and bundling to form the perijunctional rings [ 12 ] . Therefore , a concerted coordination of actin and its regulatory components is required to maintain the distinct actin morphology at the ZA . 2 . 2 . Interdependence and crosstalk In addition to physical proximity , cadherins are functionally linked with the actin cytoskeleton at all stages of cell – cell contact formation and maintenance [ 16 ] . Homophilic ligation of cadherin receptors results in a marked accumulation of actin regulatory proteins , which coincides with rapid actin assembly at cell – cell adhesion sites [ 6 ] . Thus E - cadherin adhesion can inﬂuence the junctional cytoskeleton . Equally , the stability of cadherin con - tacts requires a functional actin cytoskeleton . Actin depolymerising drugs such as Cytochalasin and Latrunculin [ 17 , 18 ] , or genetic manipulations that deplete actin regulatory proteins [ 17 , 19 ] , dis - rupt the cadherin associated cytoskeleton and perturb cell – cell adhesion . This highlights interdependence between cadherin com - plexes and the actin cytoskeleton that is crucial for effective intercellular cohesion during tissue organisation throughout devel - opment and in homeostasis . We will now discuss how the dynamic actin cytoskeleton is functionally coupled with cadherin junctions . First , we will review recent developments in understanding the process of junctional actin assembly , highlighting the role of nucleators and post - nucleation regulators in this process . Then we will consider the implications of actin assembly at intercellular contacts , for junc - tional integrity and function at the cellular level , and also at the organismal level . 3 . Actin assembly at the AJ in simple epithelia 3 . 1 . Actin polymerisation - the biochemistry of nucleation Actin is a ubiquitously expressed protein that exists in either a monomeric state , known as globular or G - actin , or polymerised to form ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) . The actin polymer displays polarity and possesses a ‘barbed’ and a ‘pointed’ end , names which were coined based on the ultra - structural appearance of actin ﬁla - ments when decorated with myosin S1 [ 20 ] . G - actin has an inherent 300 M . Michael , A . S . Yap / Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology 24 ( 2013 ) 298 – 307 Fig . 1 . Potential mechanisms of cadherin – actin interactions . ( a ) The cadherin cytoplasmic domain binds both p120 catenin and (cid:3) - catenin . (cid:2) - Catenin associates with (cid:3) - catenin , which is mutually exclusive with its F - actin interaction , however its dimer interacts with F - actin . ( b ) (cid:2) - Catenin interacts with vinculin , which can bind F - actin . ( c ) Myosin VI can interact directly with the E - cadherin cytoplasmic tail linking actin ﬁlaments to the cadherin receptor . capacity to self - assemble to form actin ﬁlaments ; however , this is intrinsically slow [ 21 , 22 ] . Within the cell , actin assembly is medi - ated by multiple molecular mechanisms that control nucleation , the rate - limiting step in actin ﬁlament assembly , or act at post - nucleation stages to inﬂuence ﬁlament turnover and organisation [ 20 ] . Dynamic growth of actin ﬁlaments occurs mainly at the barbed end , while , in contrast , actin depolymerisation is favoured at the pointed end resulting in a ‘treadmilling’ effect of actin along the ﬁlament [ 22 , 23 ] . While ﬁlament elongation occurs rapidly , actin nucleation or de novo assembly of actin ﬁlaments from monomers is biochemically unfavourable due to the instability of its precursor dimer and trimer conformations [ 22 ] . This critical step is overcome by several actin - binding proteins and regulatory complexes that facilitate this process , thereby promoting de novo actin polymeri - sation to enable rapid actin cytoskeletal remodelling in response to cellular signals or during tissue homeostasis . 3 . 2 . Actin nucleation at junctions Barbed ends , marking sites of actin nucleation , can be iden - tiﬁed by observation of labelled G - actin when incorporated into permeabilised cells [ 19 , 24 ] . Studies from such barbed end labelling assays have provided evidence for the notion that actin nucleation occurs primarily at the membrane of junctions , both in nascent and mature cell – cell contacts [ 12 , 13 ] . Furthermore this labelling appears distinct from the actin bundles that form adjacent to the membrane , in mature contacts [ 12 , 13 ] . In agreement , observation of ﬂuorescently tagged G - actin at junctions following photobleach - ing events revealed that recovery of actin intensity occurs ﬁrst at the membrane , followed by its radial spread , eventually taking shape to form the perijunctional actin bundles [ 12 ] . This suggests that actin is ﬁrst nucleated at the membrane and is subsequently re - organised to form junctional rings of the ZA . Of the plethora of actin nucleators that have been studied to date , two key nucleators have been identiﬁed to regulate cadherin - mediated junctional actin assembly . 3 . 2 . 1 . The Arp2 / 3 complex The Arp2 / 3 complex comprises two actin - related proteins ( Arp ) , Arp2 and Arp3 , and ﬁve other components [ actin - related protein complex 1 – 5 ( ARPC1 - 5 ) ] to form a stable heptameric complex [ 25 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of pre - existing ( mother ) ﬁlaments and nucleates the assembly of a daughter ﬁlament that is thereby linked at its pointed end to the mother ﬁlament [ 22 ] . Additionally , this mode of nucleation generates branched networks of ﬁlaments [ 26 ] . Of note , the heptameric complex itself is a poor nucleator due to the spatial separation of the Arp2 and Arp3 sub - units needed to form a dimer [ 20 ] . Therefore , there are mechanisms in place to regulate the activation of this process in cells in response to physiological signals . The impact of Arp2 / 3 can then be thought to occur through molecular apparatuses comprising the nucleator and its nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) ( Fig . 2a ) . 3 . 2 . 2 . Arp2 / 3 mediated actin regulation at junctions In simple epithelia , there is increasing evidence to suggest that Arp2 / 3 is a major nucleator regulating actin assembly at cadherin junctions . The Arp2 / 3 complex localises to E - cadherin junctions [ 12 , 27 ] , and can co - immunoprecipitate with E - cadherin . Indeed , homophilic ligation of E - cadherin by presentation of recombinant adhesive ligands alone , induced rapid F - actin accumulation at the adhesive contact [ 6 ] . Furthermore inhibition of Arp2 / 3 , using the N - WASP CA domain , impaired cell contact formation due to a defect in F - actin polymerisation at sites of E - cadherin ligation [ 19 ] . Recent studies in mature epithelial contacts have also shown that chem - ical inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex function or depletion by RNAi decreased barbed end labelling and consequently reduced F - actin at the plasma membrane of junctions [ 12 , 27 ] . Moreover , actin re - assembly at cell – cell contacts following Latrunculin treatment and washout was also affected when Arp2 / 3 activity was perturbed M . Michael , A . S . Yap / Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology 24 ( 2013 ) 298 – 307 301 Fig . 2 . Actin assembly at junctions . ( a ) The WAVE complex activates Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation , creating branched actin networks . These ﬁlaments are stabilised by cortactin , which acts downstream of Rac and Src kinases , and elongation is prolonged via Ena / VASP proteins . ( b ) N - WASP binds actin ﬁlaments via WIP and regulates its post - nucleation stability and organisation . Formins promote elongation of pre - existing ﬁlaments and can also nucleate actin to form linear bundles . [ 18 ] . These indicate an essential role for the Arp2 / 3 complex at var - ious stages of junctional biogenesis , through regulation of cellular F - actin content . 3 . 3 . Class I nucleation promoting factors - WASP / WAVE proteins Nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) can bind to , and activate , the Arp2 / 3 complex , facilitating actin polymerisation . The Class I NPFs include the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) and the WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) family of proteins , and recently identiﬁed new members such as WASH ( WASP and SCAR homology ) , WHAMM ( WASP homolog associated with actin , membranes and microtubules ) and JMY ( junction - mediating and regulatory protein ) [ 28 , 29 ] . While the WASP / WAVE NPFs have been extensively studied in the context of actin dynamics in lamellipodia and cell motility , the newer NPFs exhibit more var - ied functions such as vesicle trafﬁcking and WHAMM can also bind microtubules [ 28 , 29 ] . The Class I NPFs possess distinct N - terminal regions , capable of binding regulatory molecules , however they all share a common C - terminus [ 29 ] . This consists of the verprolin homology domain [ ( V ) or WASP homology - 2 ( WH2 ) ] , the coﬁlin homology domain ( C ) and the acidic region ( A ) , collectively known as the VCA region . The V region binds G - actin while the acidic domain interacts with and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex by trigger - ing its conformation change [ 20 , 28 ] . These VCA - Arp2 / 3 interactions overcome the energetically unfavourable step of actin nucleation by creating a platform to bring together the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits with a G - actin molecule creating a stable trimer to initiate nuclea - tion . To date , N - WASP and WAVE are the best studied Class I NPFs in the context of cadherin junctions . 3 . 3 . 1 . The WAVE complex The WAVE family of proteins consist of WAVE1 , WAVE2 and WAVE3 [ 28 ] . WAVE2 is ubiquitously expressed whilst WAVE1 and WAVE3 , though highly expressed in the brain are also expressed in other tissue types [ 28 ] . WAVE proteins are components of a pentameric complex including Abi , Nap1 , Sra1 and HSPC300 that together form the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) [ 28 ] . Molecular studies have shown that the intact WAVE complex is inactive , due to masking of the WAVE VCA domain , and binding of Rac GTPase is thought to result in its activation [ 30 , 31 ] . While the mechanism of WAVE activation has been hotly debated , it has been most recently proposed that Rac GTPase binding causes the allosteric activation of the WAVE complex by inducing its conformational change exposing the VCA domain for Arp2 / 3 activation [ 32 ] . 3 . 3 . 2 . WAVE - mediated actin regulation at junctions Of the WAVE family members , WAVE1 and WAVE2 are expressed in epithelial cells , however WAVE2 , is more abundant [ 17 ] . WAVE2 and other components of the WRC are observed at cadherin - mediated cell – cell contacts [ 17 , 27 ] . Furthermore , inhi - bition of WAVE2 function depletes steady state junctional F - actin [ 17 , 27 ] , decreases nucleation and disrupts the morphology of the residual junctional cytoskeleton [ 27 ] . These changes closely resem - ble those seen when Arp2 / 3 activity itself is inhibited and , indeed , WAVE2 depletion reduces Arp2 / 3 found at the ZA [ 27 ] . Of note , Rac signalling , which is proposed to activate WAVE , is also implicated in the regulation of cadherin junctions ( Fig . 2a ) . Rac is activated in response to cadherin ligation and accumulates at cell – cell contacts with its regulators , the guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFS ) [ 33 , 34 ] . Rac activity has also been functionally linked to junc - tional accumulation of WAVE2 as dominant negative mutants of Rac reduced WAVE2 localisation to junctions [ 27 ] . Indeed , reports have shown that Rac activity , via GEF Tiam1 , is required for the localisation of WAVE2 and Arp2 / 3 mediated actin assembly at cell contacts [ 17 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . Overall these ﬁndings identify the Rac - WAVE pathway as the major activation mechanism for Arp2 / 3 function at the ZA . 3 . 3 . 3 . WASP family proteins The WASP family of proteins comprise WASP , which is expressed exclusively in haematopoietic cells , and N - WASP ( or neural WASP ) , which has a broader tissue expression , albeit being abundant in neuronal cells [ 28 ] . WASP proteins harbour an N - terminal WASP homology 1 ( WH1 ) domain followed by a basic region for phosphoinositide interaction , a GTPase - binding domain 302 M . Michael , A . S . Yap / Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology 24 ( 2013 ) 298 – 307 ( GBD ) , a central proline - rich region for SH3 domain and proﬁlin binding , and the C - terminal VCA domain [ 28 ] . WASP proteins are known to be autoinhibited by intramolecular interaction between the VCA and the GBD domains [ 35 , 36 ] . Binding of Cdc42 , phos - pholipids and adaptor protein , Nck , all contribute to relieving this interaction , which exposes the VCA domain for activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 35 , 36 ] . 3 . 3 . 4 . WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) The N - terminal WH1 domain of N - WASP interacts with mem - bers of the WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) family proteins [ 37 ] . These include WIP itself , the ﬁrst identiﬁed family member , CR16 ( corticosteroids and regional expression - 16 ) and WICH [ WIP and CR16 homologous protein , also known as WIP - related ( WIRE ) ] [ 37 ] . WIP proteins harbour a homologous G - actin binding V domain at their N - terminus and a WASP - binding domain at the C - terminus . In addition , they also possess a central region containing multi - ple proﬁlin - binding sites and a F - actin binding domain [ 38 ] . Of the three family members , WIP has the broadest tissue expres - sion with high levels found in haematopoeitic cells , CR16 is highly expressed in the brain and testis [ 39 , 40 ] , and WICH / WIRE is pre - dominantly expressed in the brain , colon , stomach and lung [ 41 ] . It is interesting to note that many disease - causing mutations in the WASP protein map to its WIP - binding domain [ 42 ] , implying that the physical interaction between these two proteins is impor - tant . However , the mechanism by which WIP proteins contribute to actin assembly is incompletely understood . WIP has a variety of possible actions . WIP was found to antagonise N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation [ 43 ] , presumably by favouring its autoinhibited conformation [ 44 ] . WIP can also stabilise N - WASP expression [ 45 , 46 ] . Furthermore , WIP proteins can themselves inﬂuence ﬁlament organisation and dynamics ; both WIP and WIRE over expression in ﬁbroblasts can induce the formation of thick actin bundles in cells and WIP binding prevents F - actin ﬁlaments from disassembly in vitro [ 38 , 43 ] . Furthermore , biochemical stud - ies have supported this notion by demonstrating that WIRE can cross - link and bundle actin ﬁlaments , a function that is inhibited by N - WASP binding [ 38 ] . 3 . 3 . 5 . The N - WASP - WIP complex at junctions N - WASP is expressed in epithelial cells , can be visualised at cadherin junctions and co - immunoprecipitates with E - cadherin [ 12 ] ( Fig . 2b ) . Further , N - WASP localises to the junctional mem - brane that is also the site where Arp2 / 3 resides and disruption of N - WASP perturbs the junctional actin cytoskeleton [ 9 , 12 ] . Surpris - ingly , however , this effect on cytoskeletal regulation is independent of Arp2 / 3 activation . Thus , Kovacs et al . recently reported that N - WASP RNAi did not affect junctional nucleation , although it reduced steady - state F - actin content [ 12 ] . In addition , the junctional pheno - type of N - WASP - depleted cells could be restored by expression of an RNAi - resistant N - WASP mutant lacking the VCA domain , which was consequently unable to activate Arp2 / 3 [ 12 ] . Instead , N - WASP appeared to act in post - nucleation stages of actin assembly , to stabilise actin ﬁlaments and facilitate the organisation of F - actin ﬁlaments into perijunctional bundles [ 12 ] . Further , this function required the N - terminal WIP - binding domain of N - WASP and was attributable to binding of WIRE [ 12 ] ( Fig . 2b ) . Indeed , depletion of WIRE phenocopied the N - WASP RNAi junc - tional morphology , an effect that required the F - actin binding domain of WIRE [ 12 ] , perhaps for its actin ﬁlament cross - linking and bundling properties [ 38 ] . The exact molecular mechanism by which N - WASP controls the post - nucleation fate of nascent actin ﬁlaments or the upstream effectors that recruit N - WASP to the junctions remain to be elucidated . However , a potential pathway exists . Cdc42 , an upstream effector of N - WASP accumulates at junc - tions and is activated upon cadherin homophilic ligation [ 9 , 34 ] ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , it has been reported that loss of Cdc42 dis - rupted E - cadherin and actin morphology at junctions , a phenotype mediated by Tuba , a GEF for Cdc42 , and occurring via N - WASP activ - ity [ 9 ] . Therefore it is tempting to speculate that the junctional recruitment of N - WASP could occur via this mechanism , however , further investigation is required . 3 . 4 . Class II NPFs Class II NPFs , comprising actin binding protein - 1 ( Abp1 ) , Pan1 , and cortactin , harbour an acidic Arp2 / 3 - binding domain similar to their Class I counterparts [ 47 ] . However instead of a G - actin bind - ing region , these proteins possess an F - actin binding domain that is required for Arp2 / 3 activation . Class II NPFs have weaker abilities to activate Arp2 / 3 than do WASP / WAVE proteins [ 47 ] . Further - more the precise mechanism of Arp2 / 3 activation , though not well understood , is thought to be through association of Arp2 / 3 with F - actin [ 48 ] . Of the Class II NPFs , cortactin is the best characterised in epithelial contacts . 3 . 4 . 1 . Cortactin Cortactin is a multi - domain scaffold protein expressed in a wide range of tissues [ 49 ] . The N - terminal region harbours an NH2 - terminal acidic ( NTA ) region which is required for Arp2 / 3 binding , followed by a central F - actin binding region , proline - rich regions and SH3 domains at the C - terminus which aid in protein binding [ 50 ] . As puriﬁed cortactin has weak intrinsic Arp2 / 3 stimulatory activity [ 47 ] , it has been proposed to enhance Arp2 / 3 mediated actin polymerisation by a number of mechanisms . For example , cor - tactin and N - WASP can both interact simultaneously with Arp2 / 3 to synergistically enhance actin polymerisation [ 51 ] . Furthermore , in vitro studies have shown that cortactin can stabilise Arp2 / 3 induced actin ﬁlament branches to prevent their imminent dis - assembly [ 52 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . The cortactin SH3 domain also binds WIP , which enhances cortactin - induced Arp2 / 3 mediated actin assembly , by promoting the delivery of actin monomers to the complex via the WIP G - actin binding domain [ 53 ] . 3 . 4 . 2 . Cortactin at junctions Cortactin can be visualised at cadherin - based junctions in epithelial monolayers and accumulates in this region in a cadherin - dependent fashion [ 54 ] . Indeed , adhesion of beads , presenting recombinant cadherin ligands to cells , can recruit cortactin to the adhesive cortex , implying that homophilic ligation is sufﬁcient to recruit cortactin [ 54 ] . Consistent with this , E - cadherin and cortactin can form a biochemical complex [ 54 , 55 ] . Cortactin also contributes to cadherin - based actin assembly . For example , the increase in F - actin which occurs following adhesion of cadherin beads to cells , is reduced in cells overexpressing cortactin mutants lacking the Arp2 / 3 or F - actin - binding domains [ 54 ] . Moreover , cortactin contributes to the functional cooperation of actin assembly and cadherins . One example is evident when cells adhere to cadherin - coated substrata , a process that entails the extension of cadherin - based lamellipodia [ 54 , 56 ] and may be analogous to the extension of cell surfaces when cells ﬁrst make contacts with one another . Cadherin - based cell spreading requires actin assembly and Arp2 / 3 activity [ 19 ] and was also reduced when cortactin was depleted by RNAi or functionally perturbed by expression of dominant - negative mutants [ 54 ] . Depletion of cor - tactin disrupted the accumulation of the E - cadherin and (cid:3) - catenin complex at junctions as well as perturbed junctional actin orga - nisation , Arp2 / 3 and F - actin binding functions of cortactin being implicated in these roles [ 54 , 55 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . This indicates that cor - tactin plays a role in both contact formation and adhesion as well as junctional homeostasis via Arp2 / 3 mediated actin assembly . M . Michael , A . S . Yap / Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology 24 ( 2013 ) 298 – 307 303 Cortactin function may be regulated by cadherin ligation - induced Rac and Src signalling [ 55 , 57 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . Cortactin is recruited to the periphery of lamellipodia in response to Rac signalling how - ever it is still unclear if this occurs at junctions [ 57 ] . Src signalling , which is activated in response to cadherin ligation , was also found to be important for the maintenance of E - cadherin [ 58 ] and medi - ated cortactin phosphorylation at junctions . Indeed it was observed that cortactin phosphorylation was required for cadherin and actin integrity at the cell – cell contacts [ 55 ] . 3 . 5 . Formins 3 . 5 . 1 . Formin mediated actin assembly Although there is much research to indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is a major actin nucleator at cadherin contacts , there is some evidence to suggest that formins also contribute to junc - tional actin assembly . Formins are a superfamily of homodimeric proteins . The consensus formin structure consists of an N - terminal regulatory , formin homology - 3 ( FH3 ) domain followed by highly conserved proﬁlin - actin binding FH1 and C - terminal F - actin bind - ing FH2 domains [ 59 ] . The FH2 domain forms a head to tail dimer with a ‘doughnut shaped’ morphology that binds to the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments [ 48 , 60 ] . Formin dimers are strong actin nucle - ators in vitro however as the FH2 domain does not bind G - actin , the mechanism by which formins initiate nucleation is still unclear . On pre - existing ﬁlaments , however , it is thought that the FH1 domain delivers proﬁlin - actin monomers for actin polymerisation , while the FH2 domains moves progressively along the growing barbed end [ 47 ] , which potentially also prolongs elongation by protecting it from binding by capping proteins [ 60 ] ( Fig . 2b ) . Formin - mediated actin nucleation therefore results in the generation of unbranched actin ﬁlaments [ 48 ] . 3 . 5 . 2 . Formins at junctions Elucidating the role of formins in epithelial contacts is still a new and emerging ﬁeld . Reports on mouse keratinocytes have revealed that formin - 1 localises to junctions through direct inter - actions with (cid:2) - catenin [ 61 ] . Through this association , formin - 1 exerts its effect by promoting linear actin cable assembly during cell – cell contact formation [ 61 ] . Furthermore , the human formin Dia1 has been shown to govern junctional stability and cell – cell adhesion in epithelial cells , by the regulation of cadherin – catenin distribution and actin assembly [ 62 ] . Further , Dia1 function was activated by the Rho GTPase , in a myosin II - dependent manner [ 62 ] ( Fig . 2b ) . In contrast , a recent study by Tang and Breiher , using the broad - spectrum formin inhibitor ( SMIFH2 ) , led to the conclu - sion that formin activity may be dispensible for junctional actin assembly but more pertinent to the basal actin network [ 18 ] . It was shown that actin assembly at the junction following Latrun - culin B treatment and washout was restored in the presence of formin inhibition but not when Arp2 / 3 activity was perturbed , highlighting the importance of Arp2 / 3 as a nucleator in this pro - cess [ 18 ] . Furthermore , they were unable to detect a signiﬁcant impact on F - actin levels at junctions following formin inhibi - tion compared to that observed after chemical inactivation of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 18 ] . These discrepancies may be due to the various approaches utilised to test formin function and the cell types studied which may possess differing formin expression proﬁles . Nevertheless , the data so far , albeit mixed , point to a possible role for formins in junctional actin regulation . Moreover as both Arp2 / 3 - and formin - mediated actin assembly result in distinct structures [ 48 ] , it is possible that both nucleators play a role in different stages of actin assembly at the junctions , or to generate different actin ﬁlament populations at the junctions [ 13 ] . However the contributions of each nucleator to the overall junctional actin morphology still need to be investigated . 4 . Post - nucleation ﬁlament stabilisation at the AJ 4 . 1 . Actin elongation by formins , cortactin and Ena / VASP proteins The mechanism by which nucleated actin ﬁlaments at the mem - brane organise to form the circumferential actin rings in mature epithelia is still a question that needs further exploration . We would postulate that once branched actin networks are gener - ated , elongation has to occur followed by crosslinking or bundling of the actin ﬁlaments to form the apical rings [ 12 , 13 ] . Several actin regulators could play a role in this post - nucleation process . Formins could promote elongation of pre - existing ﬁlaments and protect barbed ends from capping [ 48 , 61 , 62 ] ( Fig . 2b ) . Similarly , cortactin could enhance Arp2 / 3 - mediated ﬁlament polymerisa - tion and stabilise existing ﬁlaments , preventing depolymerisation [ 52 , 54 , 55 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . Likewise , the Enabled / Vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein ( Ena / VASP ) family of proteins may also contribute in this role . This protein family comprises of three mammalian homologs , Mena , VASP and EVL [ 63 ] . They harbour both G - and F - actin binding domains which facilitate binding to barbed ends of actin ﬁlament and promote ﬁlament elongation whilst pre - venting ﬁlament termination by capping protein binding [ 64 , 65 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . Additionally , they can function as processive barbed - end actin polymerases [ 66 ] . Ena / VASP proteins can be found at epithelial contacts and have been implicated in junctional actin assembly as sequestration of Ena / VASP proteins from their usual sub - cellular locations resulted in reduced actin levels at junc - tions thereby conﬁrming their roles in supporting junctional actin assembly [ 67 ] . 4 . 2 . The N - WASP - WIRE apparatus , myosin II isoforms and myosin VI in post - nucleation actin organisation Following actin elongation , ﬁlament reorganisation has to take place in order to form the perijunctional bundles at epithelial contacts . As discussed previously , N - WASP , via interaction with WIRE , has been implicated in this post - nucleation stage [ 12 ] . In addition , various other actin binding proteins that localise to con - tacts could also play a role in this process . The myosin family of actin binding motor proteins , in particular , myosin II and VI may regulate junctional actin morphology via ﬁlament organisa - tion and mechanotransduction [ 68 ] . Both myosin II isoforms , IIA and IIB , localise to cadherin contacts [ 11 ] . Treatment of epithelial monolayers with blebbistatin , a myosin II inhibitor [ 69 ] , disrupts junctional actin bundles as well as E - cadherin distribution exem - plifying the importance of these motor proteins in maintaining epithelial contacts [ 70 ] ( Fig . 3 ) . There are also isoform - speciﬁc dif - ferences in myosin II regulation ; myosin IIA is recruited to contacts in an E - cadherin dependent fashion and in turn governs E - cadherin distribution at the junctions downstream of RhoA activity ; in con - trast , myosin IIB has a stronger impact on actin morphology at the ZA and acts downstream of both Rap1 and Src kinase [ 11 , 71 ] . Myosin VI may also be a key regulator in later stages of junc - tional assembly . In contrast to conventional myosin II isoforms , myosin VI only accumulates at mature epithelial contacts and can also interact directly with E - cadherin [ 72 , 73 ] ( Fig . 1c ) . In other cellular contexts , myosin VI has been shown to stabilise actin ﬁla - ments and this function may be conserved in epithelial junctions as loss of myosin VI results in a loosely packed actin ﬁlaments at epithelial contacts instead of the concentrated actin bundles observed [ 72 , 74 ] . 304 M . Michael , A . S . Yap / Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology 24 ( 2013 ) 298 – 307 Fig . 3 . Actomyosin dynamics at junctions . Rho , Rap and Src signalling regulate myosin II recruitment to junctions . The actin - bound myosin II motors produces contractile forces ( red arrows ) required for the generation of junctional tension . 4 . 3 . Filament cross - linking and bundling by vinculin , ˛ - catenin and ˛ - actinin One promising , downstream effector of myosin VI for actin ﬁlament cross - linking and bundling is vinculin , a protein well characterised in focal adhesion dynamics [ 75 ] . It also localises to cadherin contacts , potentially through interactions with a num - ber of junctional proteins including myosin VI , (cid:2) - catenin and (cid:3) - catenin [ 72 , 76 , 77 ] ( Fig . 1b ) . Recently vinculin has been impli - cated in mechanosensing downstream of cadherin receptors and has been shown to accumulate at contacts in response to tension at cell – cell contacts in a myosin II - dependent manner [ 77 , 78 ] . While the actin ﬁlament cross - linking and bundling properties of vinculin have been demonstrated in vitro and in focal adhesions , its role in actin ﬁlament organisation at the junction is yet to be fully inves - tigated [ 79 ] . Nevertheless it is tempting to speculate that similar attributes exist for vinculin at junctions . Other ﬁlament cross - linkers , such as (cid:2) - actinin , which localises and moderates junctional actin assembly could also contribute to this process however its speciﬁc role at later stages of actin assembly is still unclear [ 18 ] . 5 . Functional impact of actin assembly on cadherin dynamics 5 . 1 . Impact of actin assembly on the cell biology of cadherin function At the cellular level , actin assembly contributes to the integrity of cell – cell junctions and their mechanical homeostasis . Individ - ual targeting of a variety of molecules , by depletion or expression of dominant - negative mutants , disrupts cadherin - based junctions . This includes direct targeting of Arp2 / 3 itself [ 12 , 19 , 27 ] , WAVE2 [ 17 ] , or cortactin [ 54 , 55 ] . As well , junctions were disrupted when the function of N - WASP [ 12 , 80 ] or WIRE was perturbed . Similarly , Ena / VASP proteins contribute to the assembly of epithelial contacts in keratinocytes [ 81 ] and support endothelial barriers [ 82 ] . Thus actin nucleation mediated by Arp2 / 3 and the post - nucleation reg - ulation of ﬁlaments contribute to the formation or maintenance of cadherin junctions . Formins , too , contribute to junctional integrity in keratinocytes [ 61 ] , indicating that many aspects of actin regula - tion are closely coupled to cadherin function . How , then , does actin assembly support cadherin function ? Potentially , this may affect several cellular processes that ulti - mately collaborate to control the presentation of cadherins at the cell surface and their biological function . These include cadherin stabilisation by control of its endocytosis and the organisation of cadherins into specialised junctions [ 83 ] . Here we would highlight the central role that myosin II may play in this process . Non - muscle myosin II can control several key aspects of junction biology , includ - ing the cortical organisation of adhesion receptors into specialised junctions , such as the epithelial ZA [ 11 , 70 ] ; and generation of junc - tional tension [ 84 ] , processes that participate in cadherin - based morphogenesis [ 85 – 87 ] . Myosin II function is obligately linked to F - actin , as a consequence of its ability to both bind and slide ﬁl - aments ( Fig . 3 ) . Further , myosin II recruitment to junctions was compromised in epithelial cells lacking Arp2 / 3 or WAVE function [ 27 ] , implicating Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly in the junctional action of myosin II . Consistent with this , junctional tension and ZA integrity were compromised in Arp2 / 3 or WAVE - depleted cells [ 27 ] . A role for Arp2 / 3 - WAVE in the junctional action of myosin II is , however , somewhat paradoxical . Myosin II is generally thought to favour anti - parallel actin ﬁlament networks , rather than the branched networks that are nucleated by Arp2 / 3 [ 88 ] . Indeed , myosin II typically segregates away from regions that are domi - nated by branched networks [ 89 – 91 ] and its function may actually be antagonised by Arp2 / 3 [ 85 ] . One likely explanation is that ﬁla - ment reorganisation , perhaps including debranching , is necessary to allow Arp2 / 3 - generated networks to be suitable for myosin II incorporation . How this may occur at the junctional cytoskeleton is not yet understood , and will be an important issue for research . 5 . 2 . Other model systems Besides the maintenance of epithelial and tissue morphology in simple epithelia , cadherin - mediated adhesions and its underly - ing actin machinery play a pivotal role in other cellular contexts including organismal developmental , tissue remodelling and mor - phogenetic processes . 5 . 2 . 1 . Embryonic morphogenesis The role of cadherins and their underlying actin cytoskele - ton is most apparent during developmental processes such as embryogenesis where a critical balance between assembly and dis - assembly of adhesions and force generation is required to enable tissue rearrangements [ 92 ] . The core cadherin – catenin complex governs embryogenesis of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms through the regulation of cell sorting , adhesion and establishment of linkages with the actin cytoskeleton , which enables tissue shape changes [ 93 ] . For example , hypodermal cells in the developing C . elegans embryo undergo enclosure followed by a coordinated elon - gation process which depends on the cadherin – catenin complex and connections with the actin cytoskeleton [ 15 ] . Moreover , loss - of - function cadherin mutants in Zebraﬁsh embryos fail to sort into distinct epiblast layers and are unable to induce tissue shape change following intercalation [ 94 ] . This is further exempliﬁed by recent studies , using live - cell imaging tools , which suggest that dynamic interactions between the actomyosin machinery and junctional M . Michael , A . S . Yap / Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology 24 ( 2013 ) 298 – 307 305 components occur to drive shape changes in the Drosophila embryo during gastrulation [ 95 ] . In agreement with the role of junctional actin assembly as an integral component for morphogenesis , the Arp2 / 3 and WRC have been implicated in this process [ 96 , 97 ] . In C . elegans , it was observed that loss of any component of the WRC or the Arp2 / 3 complex resulted in embryogenesis defects [ 97 ] and likewise , Bernadskaya et al . observed that mutations in ( or loss of ) Arp2 / 3 and WAVE pro - teins resulted in impaired intestinal development , both occurring as a result of decreased apical F - actin accumulation [ 96 ] . Scar , the WAVE ortholog in Drosophila , and the Arp2 / 3 complex are required for cortical actin organisation , potentially through the regulation of nucleation , in the blastoderm [ 98 ] . Similarly WASP has been shown to regulate hypodermal enclosure in C . elegans embryos acting via a parallel pathway to the WRC , potentially through Arp2 / 3 activation [ 45 , 99 ] . Cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton have also been implicated in the migration of border cells within the developing Drosophila embryo [ 100 ] . Drosophila DE - cadherin is required in both border cells and nurse cells for proper migration to occur . Mutations in Scar result in abnormal morphology of nurse cells due to a decrease in actin distribution at the ring canal connecting the nurse cells , which is reminiscent of the Arp2 / 3 mutant phenotype [ 98 ] . Incidentally , in contrast to Scar , mutations in WASP displayed no abnormali - ties suggesting that WASP does not regulate Arp2 / 3 mediated actin polymerisation in this model system [ 98 ] . 5 . 2 . 2 . Myogenesis During skeletal muscle formation in vertebrate and invertebrates , mononucleated progenitor myoblasts undergo a series of processes including migration , adhesion , actin accu - mulation at site of contact and fusion , to form multinucleated myotubes [ 101 ] . Incidentally , cadherins and several junctional actin cytoskele - tal regulators are involved in modulating this process . The process of fusion requires cell – cell recognition and adhesion , which is mediated by cadherins , amongst other adhesion receptors [ 102 ] . Cadherin ligation between adjacent myoblasts triggers a down - stream signalling cascade , which includes the regulation of Rho GTPases [ 103 ] . This leads to the actin nucleation and reorganisa - tion at the sites of contact to form the actin ‘focus’ , an important precursor structure for fusion [ 103 ] . Rac signalling has been shown to be essential for various stages of fusion through activation of the WAVE complex , which promotes Arp2 / 3 mediated actin nucleation at adhesion sites [ 103 , 104 ] . WASP family function , through WIP binding is also required for proper myoblast fusion albeit at later stages of fusion and distinct from WAVE activity [ 104 , 105 ] . There - fore it is tempting to draw analogies comparing the model system of myogenesis with the WASP / WAVE mediated actin organisation that occurs at epithelial junctions . 5 . 2 . 3 . Nervous system development The neuronal synapse is a site of cell – cell contact that deploys similar core actin regulatory machinery to that of the AJ in epithelia . Cadherins and their associated catenins localise to synaptic junc - tions and are required for cell – cell recognition and adhesion during early stages of neuronal synapse assembly [ 106 , 107 ] . Adhesion via cadherin receptors triggers Rho GTPase signalling which results in F - actin rearrangements at the synapse [ 108 ] . The Rac - WAVE complex pathway , via Arp2 / 3 activation , have been implicated this process as the absence of WAVE results in defective synapse devel - opment and an overall loss of neural connectivity in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems [ 109 , 110 ] . Similarly , studies in primary hippocampal neurons have shown that N - WASP regulates neuronal synapse formation downstream of Cdc42 and via Arp2 / 3 mediated actin assembly [ 111 ] . In contrast , WIP functions as a negative regulator of synapse maturation , presumably though the stabilisation of N - WASP in its autoinhibited conformation [ 43 , 112 ] . The role of N - WASP - WIP complex in this system are thus in agree - ment with their conventional role in cells , however it is in contrast to their recently identiﬁed post - nucleation function at the ZA . 6 . Concluding remarks A symbiotic relationship exists between cadherin receptors and the actin cytoskeleton , where ligation at cadherin contacts mediate actin organisation , which in turn establishes cadherin distribu - tion at the junctions , maintaining cell adhesion . This functional interplay is essential for tissue integrity in health and its mis - regulation leads to disease . The junctional actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that undergoes constant reorganisation at the ZA , therefore a coordinated action of the actin regulators is required to achieve the morphologically stable actin organisation at the contact . Actin assembly machinery such as nucleators , elongation factors and bundling proteins all contribute to maintain junctional actin architecture during homeostasis . Whilst the importance of individual components in supporting cadherin and actin junctional organisation has been well studied mainly in the context of epithe - lia , there is still much to learn about the spatio - temporal roles for individual components during overall ﬁlament organisation as part of an ensemble and the mechanism of post - nucleation ﬁlament organisation .
