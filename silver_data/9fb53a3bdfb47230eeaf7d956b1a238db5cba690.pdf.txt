Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems ∗ Kichard Rarp University of Balifornia , Cerkeley ABSTRACT A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs , digraphs , integers , arrays of integers , ﬁnite families of ﬁnite sets , boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains . Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a ﬁnite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems , and we can inquire into their computational complexity . It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input . Many problems with wide applicability – e . g . , set cover , knapsack , hitting set , max cut , and satisﬁability – lack a polynomial algorithm for solving them , but also lack a proof that no such polynomial algorithm exists . Hence , they remain “open problems . ” This paper references the recent work , “On the Reducibility of Combinatorial Problems” [ 1 ] . BODY A large class of open problems are mutually convertible via poly - time reduc - tions . Hence , either all can be solved in poly - time , or none can . REFERENCES [ 1 ] R . Karp .
