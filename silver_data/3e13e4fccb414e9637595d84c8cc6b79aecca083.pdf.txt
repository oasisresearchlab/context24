Accordingly , the advent of super - resolution imaging 1 – 4 has greatly advanced our understanding of a range of biological structures from focal adhesions 5 to the neuronal cytoskeleton 6 . Although recent developments in super - resolution imaging have been revolutionary in improving optical resolution , they are limited in resolving real - time dynamics along the z - direction , perpendicular to the sample . One of the simplest methods to improve axial resolution is total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy 7 , 8 . TIRF takes advantage of an evanescent excitation ﬁeld that decays exponentially from the coverslip , limiting the illumination depth to B 100 – 200 nm . Given the exponential decay of the evanescent ﬁeld , a number of TIRF - based axial imaging approaches have been developed by simply recording changes in intensity 9 , collecting a sequence of images at different incidence angles 10 or normalizing the TIRF image to a wideﬁeld image 11 . Among these methods , differential interference nanometry ( DiNa ) is robust to changes in protein clustering , as axial imaging is achieved by using the ratio between wideﬁeld ﬂuorescence and TIRF . This approach is advantageous when studying processes involving protein oligomerization and trafﬁcking . However , DiNa reports the difference in height between two different proteins that need to be matched in expression level . Moreover , DiNa and other TIRF - based approaches are hampered by the requirement of capturing multiple images to obtain the axial z - position and thus limits temporal resolution . This is particularly problematic when imaging the dynamics of most biological structures at the plasma membrane . Accordingly , it is not possible to distinguish rapid changes in protein density from dynamic movements in z - position . For example , both the protein composition and the axial position of a clathrin - coated pit can rapidly ( B ms – s ) change during pit maturation , and consequently direct evidence of this process is lacking . Similarly , the non - TIRF - based technique scanning angle interference microscopy provides B 10 nm axial resolution , but requires collecting a sequence of B 10 images at different incidence angles and is thus appropriate only for relatively static structures 12 . Therefore , existing techniques are suitable for imaging relatively static structures , such as mature focal adhesions and stationary microtubules , but not appropriate to the study of dynamic protein complexes . Thus , there is a signiﬁcant need for methods to acquire the nanometre position of protein structures in real - time . Herein we present a technique , simultaneous two - wavelength axial ratiometry ( STAR ) , for measuring the height of tagged molecules with nanometre resolution in real - time . Results In STAR , the sample is excited with two wavelengths , each with a unique evanescent decay constant , to measure the axial position of dual - tagged molecules ( Fig . 1a ) . The proﬁle of the evanescent ﬁeld is deﬁned as : I ¼ I 0 e (cid:2) zd and d ¼ l 4 p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ n 21 sin y 2 (cid:2) n 22 q ð 1 Þ where I 0 is the intensity at z ¼ 0 , n 1 and n 2 are the indices of refraction of the glass coverslip and the sample , respectively , l is the excitation wavelength and y is the angle of incidence . The intensity proﬁle of the excitation ﬁeld is unique for each wavelength , resulting in a ratio of ﬂuorescence emission intensity between the two channels that is dependent on the nanometre axial position ( Fig . 1b ) . Although the absolute intensity in each channel is proportional to the number of molecules , the ratio of the two channels is independent of molecular density and depends only on the z - position . Therefore , the relative z - position can be calculated by : D z ¼ ln R R ref (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 g ð 2 Þ a b e c TIRF 638 TIRF 488 Widefield 638 Ratio 7 2 h g x ( nm ) z ( n m ) f Cell Protein of interest 488 nm 638 nm Glass 200 nm 0 nm 0 20 40 60 80 5 15 25 35 45 Signal to noise R e s o l u t i on ( n m ) 0 250 500 z ( nm ) S i gna l 1 , 500 1 , 000 500 Measured Theoretical 00 200 400 z ( nm ) D i v e r gen c e ( n m ) 20 10 0 – 10 200 400 10 30 50 70 90 100 200 300 400 Signal to noise Δ z ( n m ) d 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 R e s o l u t i on ( n m ) 1 5 3 I n t en s i t y 0 1 0 . 5 50 100 0 200 400 0 R e s o l u t i on ( n m ) Δ z ( nm ) Figure 1 | STAR theory and demonstration .

In our experiments , l 1 ¼ 488 nm and l 2 ¼ 638 nm , commonly used wavelengths for cellular imaging ( Fig . 1a ) . Thus , in principle , the nanometre height of assembling or disassembling structures can be measured in real - time from the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensities at these two wavelengths . To determine the theoretical resolution of STAR , we simulated raw ﬂuorescence intensity data incorporating photon ( shot ) noise , while also varying protein concentration , z - position and inci - dence angle . This analysis revealed that the theoretical resolution depends heavily on the signal - to - noise ratio ( S / N ) and can be as small as 5 nm when an object is bright ( Fig . 1c ) . Importantly , resolution is primarily dependent on emitter brightness ( that is , S / N ratio ) , regardless of the z - position of the object of interest ( Fig . 1d ) . Although Fig . 1d may seem counterintuitive , this relationship assumes a constant S / N ratio at different z - positions , which does require increasing the number of emitters to offset the decay in evanescent ﬁeld intensity . If , however , the number of ﬂuorophores remains constant as the object moves away from the coverslip , then both the S / N ratio and resolution of STAR decrease . This situation is plotted in Fig . 1e , assuming an initial S / N ratio of 70 near the coverslip . For example , the z - resolution of a structure near the coverslip is predicted at 8 nm and this increases to 43 nm when the object translocates 300 nm away from the coverslip . This change in resolution is due to a decrease in S / N ratio , as the object moves through the evanescent ﬁeld , away from the coverslip . Interestingly , the resolution can be tailored to better accommodate speciﬁc z - positions by varying the incidence angle ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . To validate the accuracy of STAR , we imaged ﬂuorescently labelled silica microspheres ( beads ) with a low refractive index compatible with TIRF 13 . When imaged using an inverted microscope , the height of the bead ( z ) increases with distance from the bead centre ( x ) and can be described by simple trigonometry ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The beads were functionalized with biotin and then modiﬁed with streptavidin dual - labelled with Alexa 647 and Alexa 488 . Labelled microspheres were mounted on coverslips in refractive index - matched media and imaged using STAR . To determine the labelling uniformity and diameter of individual beads , conventional TIRF and wideﬁeld images were acquired and analysed ( Fig . 1f ) . The height proﬁle of uniformly labelled beads was then calculated from the ﬂuorescence intensity ratio ( Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The experimentally measured average height proﬁle for 19 beads ( diameter ¼ 6 . 08 m m ) was in agreement with the predicted height proﬁle ( Fig . 1g ) . The deviation of the experimental proﬁle from the predicted height increased at greater z - positions , a trend expected given the lower S / N ratio at greater z ( Fig . 1h ) . The average divergence of the experiment from theory was o 20 nm over a range of z - positions from 0 to 400 nm . The lower experimental precision than that predicted from the simulation ( compare Fig . 1c – e with Fig . 1h ) is probably due to variations in the physical uniformity of the beads as well as our ability to accurately measure their diameters . Having established the accuracy of the technique , we next used STAR to create a height map of microtubules in ﬁxed cells . COS - 7 cells were ﬁxed and microtubules labelled with a biotinylated primary antibody and Alexa 488 and Alexa 647 - tagged streptavidin . Cells were imaged with wideﬁeld ( Fig . 2a ) and TIRF ( Fig . 2b ) in both the 488 - and 638 - nm channels .

The ratio of the wideﬁeld channels was uniform ( 1 . 9 ± 0 . 3 ; s ¼ s . d . comparing wideﬁeld images ) for all microtubules in the cell ( Fig . 2c ) . This was expected , because the wideﬁeld ratio measures the product of the detection efﬁciency of the Alexa 488 and Alexa 647 dyes and their respective labelling ratios . We further veriﬁed that the density of labelled streptavidin did not affect the ratio by using surfaces functionalized with varying densities of dual - tagged streptavidin ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . In contrast , the ratio of the TIRF images varied from 1 to 8 along individual microtubules , displaying an overall decrease near the cell edge ( Fig . 2d ) corresponding to the cell – substrate contact regions captured with reﬂection interference contrast microscopy ( RICM ; Fig . 2e ) . To determine the nanometre z - position , the TIRF images for each channel were background subtracted and divided to obtain a ratio ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . The signal corresponding to z ¼ 0 was determined from the intensity ratio of the wideﬁeld images . The STAR height map was then calculated using equation ( 2 ) . RICM shows a tight association between the cell membrane and the substrate near the cell edge ; this contact is reduced towards the centre of the cell ( Fig . 2e ) . Likewise , the microtubules near the cell edge are generally located between 0 and 100 nm , and increase in height towards the centre of the cell ( Fig . 2f ) . These values agree with published z - positions obtained using scanning - angle ﬂuorescence interference contrast microscopy 12 . One important caveat is that when two structures are located within the same diffraction limited spot but at different heights ( microtubules crossing ) , the STAR measurement is biased . For example , two objects at z ¼ 50 and 100 nm will appear as a single object at z ¼ 68 nm , rather than at z ¼ 75 nm . To demonstrate the dynamic imaging capability of STAR , we next measured the nanometre z - dynamics of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) during ligand binding , clustering and internalization at the plasma membrane . EGFR endocytosis involves a host of rapidly assembling proteins and plasma membrane deformations , and this process can be triggered by addition of its ligand , EGF 14 . Although the overall cellular response to EGF is well characterized , the assembly dynamics of individual vesicles are difﬁcult to capture . We tandem tagged the carboxy terminus of EGFR with both enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( EGFP ) and infrared ﬂuorescent protein ( iRFP ) 15 , creating EGFR - EGFP - iRFP ( Fig . 3a ) . These ﬂuorophores were selected to maximize the STAR dynamic range , while also minimizing ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( Supplementary Figs 6 and 7 , and a b T 638 T 488 R a t i o 2 . 5 0 5 μ m 5 μ m EGFR extracellulardomain EGFR intracellulardomain EGFP - iRFP fusion d 0 . 8 t + 68 . 4 s t + 81 s t + 91 . 8 s t + 147 . 3 s 1 . 8 T 638 T 488 R a t i o e t + 0 s t + 54 . 3 s t + 105 s t + 159 . 6 s T 638 T 488 R a t i o 0 . 8 1 . 8 c t = 0 s t = 121 s t = 135 s t = 159 s 0 3 P un c t a r a t i o M e m b r ane r a t i o Δ z D y na m i c r e f e r en c e Δ z S t a t i c r e f e r en c e I 638 ( a . u . ) I 638 ( a . u . ) I 488 ( a . u . ) I 488 ( a . u . ) P un c t a r a t i o M e m b r ane r a t i o Δ z D y na m i c r e f e r en c e Δ z S t a t i c r e f e r en c e Time ( s ) Time ( s ) 0 0 0 0 . 5 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 0 8 , 000 8 , 000 10 , 000 10 , 000 12 , 000 1 . 5 50 50 0 0 0 . 5 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 5 50 100 100 100 150 0 50 100 150 8 , 000 10 , 000 10 , 000 15 , 000 Figure 3 | Imaging EGFR endocytosis in real - time with STAR .

All rights reserved . Supplementary Note 2 ) . Transiently transfected COS - 7 cells expressing EGFR - EGFP - iRFP were simultaneously imaged to generate STAR data ( Fig . 3b ) . The signal in both ﬂuorescence channels was generally diffuse and localized to the plasma membrane . Within 5 min of stimulation with 2 nM EGF , dynamic formation and disappearance of EGFR puncta was observed , conﬁrming biological activity of the dual - tagged construct ( Fig . 3c ) . As a control to establish the requirement for the dual - tagged construct , we compared COS - 7 cells expressing EGFR - EGFP - iRFP to those expressing two proteins , EGFR - EGFP and EGFR - iRFP . We found that the ratio of the iRFP and EGFP emission intensities ﬂuctuated signiﬁcantly when the individual tagged proteins were mixed , producing both positive and negative D z measurements ; in contrast , the dual - tagged construct displayed a narrow range of ratios . The ﬂuctuations were attributed to differential expression and localization of the individually tagged target proteins ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Following EGF stimulation , the accumulation of EGFR within diffraction limited spots in both channels was used to identify potential endocytic pits for further analysis ( Fig . 3c ) . Images and analysis highlighting the dynamics of a representative EGFR puncta are shown in Fig . 3d . The EGFP and iRFP ﬂuorescence intensities were measured over time from a region of interest ( ROI ) corresponding to the puncta . The ratio of these values directly provides R , as deﬁned in equation ( 2 ) . Importantly , R can be used to obtain an absolute nanometre D z in two ways . One method is a dynamic reference , where the nanometre position of the EGFR pit is determined relative to the surrounding plasma membrane height in each frame ( Fig . 3d , ROI denoted as dashed yellow circle and plot of membrane ratio ) . This type of measurement produces a D z that is robust against undulations in the position of the cell membrane ( Fig . 3d , dynamic reference plot ) . Alternatively , the nanometre D z position of an individual puncta can be referenced to a static position before formation of the pit by averaging the initial 20 frames of the same ROI before EGFR accumulation ( Fig . 3d , static reference plot ; Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Comparison of the D z plots obtained using static and dynamic referencing indicates nearly identical results , suggesting minimal membrane ﬂuctuations in the time window of observa - tion . This is likely dependent on cell type , ligand and surface functionalization . It is noteworthy that all D z measurements were corrected for differential photobleaching of the two ﬂuorophores by applying a correction to the time - lapse data ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Based on the analysis of a large data set including 60 EGFR puncta from 3 cells using a static reference , several distinct behaviours falling into 3 categories were identiﬁed . Approximately one - third of the observed puncta were in the ﬁrst category , where an increase in z correlated with an increase in ﬂuorescence intensity in both channels . Typically , the ﬂuorescence reached a value that was twofold over background , while D z reached a height of 80 nm that was maintained for tens of seconds . Finally , this was followed by a rapid return to the baseline z that coincided with loss of ﬂuorescence and disappearance of the puncta from the evanescent ﬁeld ( Fig . 3d ) . The measured maximum z of 80 nm is consistent with a 100 - nm radius sphere ( vesicle ) imaged using STAR and agrees with the dimensions of clathrin - coated pits determined by cryo - electron microscopy ( Supplementary Note 3 ) . 16 The recorded height dynamics are consistent with two models for internalization wherein EGFR is recruited to preformed pits or EGFR recruitment and pit maturation occur simultaneously . Therefore , the data agree with the current hypothesis wherein cargo is sorted into pre - formed pits and provides additional detail as to the z - dynamics at the time of cargo selection 17 , 18 . In the second category , puncta had an accumulation of EGFR and increasing ﬂuorescence intensity that was not associated with displacement in z ( Fig . 3e ) . This probably represents EGFR clustering and oligomerization on the plasma membrane not associated with trafﬁcking in the experimental time frame . The persistence of EGFR clusters without endocytosis suggests that these assemblies may be functioning as a signalling platform . The remaining third of observed puncta did not fall into either of the ﬁrst two categories and were placed in a third group . The dynamics in this category were heterogeneous , encompassing cases that displayed varying D z and EGFR intensity . Of note are puncta where an increase in EGFR intensity was associated with a decrease in height ( possibly an EGFR containing vesicle trafﬁcking towards the plasma membrane ) . Taken together , these observations indicate that EGFR clustering is highly hetero - geneous and does not always represent successful endocytosis . Discussion We have developed a simple turn - key strategy based on a commercial TIRF microscope to determine the z - position of proteins within a cell with nanometre resolution in real - time . The microtubule height maps and tracking of EGFR endocytosis demonstrate compatibility with widely available organic dyes and conventional ﬂuorescent proteins . A central advantage of the method is real - time imaging of protein dynamics . This is certainly the case when STAR is compared with scanning angle ﬂuorescence interference contrast microscopy 12 . One caveat for STAR is that the localization is limited to ﬂuorophores excited by the evanescent ﬁeld . We demonstrate this capability by imaging EGFR endocytosis dynamics , providing direct evidence in support of two of the long - standing models describing the mechanism of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Although some trajectories are in agreement with existing models , our data highlights alternate dynamics of EGFR that are difﬁcult to measure with existing techniques . Importantly , STAR will likely open the door to gaining new insights into the mechanisms of trafﬁcking and assembly of hundreds of membrane - associated proteins central to many of essential cellular processes in a range of living systems . Methods Theory .

The reference ratio can be measured in several ways : at t ¼ 0 , in a speciﬁc region of the sample , from a wideﬁeld image or on a calibration sample known to be restricted in z . D z ¼ ln I l 2 I l 1 = I l 2ref I l 1ref (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:3) 1 g ð 8 Þ It is worth noting that this is equivalent to equation ( 2 ) where R is the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensity between l 2 and l 1 , and R ref is the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensities between l 2 and l 1 at a reference z - position . This can be deﬁned in different ways depending on the experiment .

A static R ref can be measured in several ways : at the coverslip sample interface , from an ROI within the plasma membrane at t ¼ 0 , from a ratio of wideﬁeld images or from an earlier time point for the object of interest . In contrast , R ref can also be determined dynamically . In this case , each time point in a series has its own R ref measurement , obtained from an ROI within the same image ( for example , dashed yellow circle Fig . 3d ) . In our analysis of EGFR , we ﬁnd that the dynamic and static referencing approaches lead to similar results within the time window of the experiment ( B 1h ) . Cell culture . COS - 7 cells were cultured in DMEM ( Mediatech ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Mediatech ) , sodium pyruvate ( 1mM , Sigma ) , L - glutamine ( 2 . 1mM , Mediatech ) , penicillin G ( 100IUml (cid:2) 1 , Mediatech ) and streptomycin ( 100 m gml (cid:2) 1 , Mediatech ) , and were incubated at 37 (cid:2) C with 5 % CO 2 . Cells were passaged at 80 % – 90 % conﬂuency and plated at a density of 25 % using standard cell culture procedures . Microscope setup . Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse Ti TIRF microscope with Elements software ( Nikon ) . The microscope is equipped with an Evolve electron - multiplying CCD ( charge - coupled device ; Photometrics ) used for cell imaging and a CoolSnap CCD camera ( Photometrics ) used for bead imaging , an Intensilight epiﬂuorescence source ( Nikon ) , a CFI Apo (cid:3) 100 1 . 49 numerical aperture objective , and 488nm ( 10mW ) and 638nm ( 20mW ) laser lines . The microscope was equipped with a Quad Band ( 405 / 488 / 561 / 638m ) laser TIRF ﬁlter cube with emission bands 500 / 25 and 730 / 55 , and a cube for RICM ( Chroma ) . EGFR internalization was imaged with an optical splitter , the Opto - Split III ( Cairn Research ) , using 500 / 25 and 730 / 55 emission ﬁlters and a 600lp dichroic to split the ﬂuorescence emission onto separate regions of the camera . Plasmids . We used EGFR ( Rat ) tagged with EGFP ( pEGFP - N1 - EGFR ) 19 . EGFR tagged with EGFP and iRFP ( EGFR - EGFP - iRFP ) was constructed as follows : ﬁrst , iRFP was cloned out of Addgene plasmid 31856 ( pShuttle CMV iRFP ) using PCR . ( This version of iRFP is now known as iRFP 713 . ) The PCR product was ligated into the AgeI site in the EGFP - EGFR plasmid creating the EGFR - EGFP - iRFP construct . EGFR tagged with iRFP alone was constructed by ligating iRFP into pEGFR - N1 - EGFP in the place of EGFP . Cloning was performed by Oskar Laur at the Emory University cloning core . Silica microsphere labelling and imaging . Five - micrometre aminated silica microspheres ( Bang’s Labs ) were functionalized with N - hydroxysuccinimide ester ( NHS ) biotin ( Pierce ) , following the manufacturer’s protocols . Biotinylated beads were puriﬁed via centrifugation and resuspended in 1 (cid:3) PBS ( 3 cycles , 10min per cycle ) . The beads were then incubated with dual - tagged streptavidin ( prepared by standard reaction with succinimidyl esters of Alexa 488 and Alexa 647 ( Life Technologies ) for 20min and re - puriﬁed . For imaging , beads were added to wells of a glass - bottomed 96 - well plate ( Nunco ) in 63 . 5 % glycerol formulated to match the index of refraction of the beads ( n ¼ 1 . 43 ) . Beads were imaged with sequential TIRF 638 , TIRF 488 , wideﬁeld 638 and wideﬁeld 488 excitation . Microtubule imaging . COS - 7 cells were seeded into wells of a glass - bottomed 96 - well plate ( Nunco ) and grown overnight . The next day , cells were rinsed with 5ml 1 (cid:3) PBS and incubated with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( in 1 (cid:3) PBS ) for 12min . Cells were then rinsed with 5ml 1 (cid:3) PBS and permeabilized for 5min with 0 . 1 % Triton - X in 1 (cid:3) PBS . Cells were then rinsed with 5ml PBS followed by incubation with 1 % BSA in 1 (cid:3) PBS for 1h at room temperature . After blocking , cells were labelled with a biotinylated a - tubulin primary antibody ( Life Technologies ) at 1 : 400 dilution in 1 % BSA ( in 1 (cid:3) PBS ) for 1h , followed by rinsing and incubation with 1 m g dual - tagged streptavidin in 200 m l 1 % BSA in 1 (cid:3) PBS . Following ﬁxation and staining , cells were imaged with the quad - band TIRF cube and alternating TIRF 488 and TIRF 638 excitation . EGFR imaging . COS - 7 cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips and subsequently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 , following the manufacturer’s protocols . The cells were incubated in serum - free media for 1h before imaging . In the case of cells transfected with iRFP constructs , the serum - free media incubation included 5 m M biliverdin ( the co - factor for iRFP ) . Time - lapse imaging was performed on individual cells following addition of 2nM EGF ( R & D Biosystems ) . Five - minute movies were acquired with 200ms exposure times and a 300 - ms delay between frames . All live cell data were acquired using the Cairn OptosplitIII setup described above . Theoretical analysis . The effect of noise on STAR measurements was evaluated with theoretical modelling . A virtual STAR experiment was constructed in Matlab with the starting conditions chosen to closely match experimental conditions : l 1 ¼ 488nm ; l 2 ¼ 638 ; n 1 ¼ 1 . 515 ; n 2 ¼ 1 . 33 ; y ¼ 70 (cid:2) . All analysis was conducted on a pixel - by - pixel basis . I 488 was deﬁned by a given intensity at z , all other intensities , I 488 and I 638 at z ¼ 0 and I 638 at z were calculated from the evanescent ﬁeld equations assuming I 488 ¼ I 638 at z ¼ 0 . In Fig . 1e , S / N ratio was deﬁned at z ¼ 0 for both 488 and 638 , and the intensity at all other z - positions was generated from the evanescent ﬁeld proﬁle . Measurements were simulated 1 , 000 (cid:3) with Poisson - distributed shot noise . Distance from the coverslip , z , was calculated ( equation ( 2 ) ) . Resolution was deﬁned as the s . d . of the residual of the calculated z - position from the true position . This was repeated for S / N values ranging from 10 to 80 and z - positions from 5 to 400nm . References 1 . Klar , T . A . , Jakobs , S . , Dyba , M . , Egner , A . & Hell , S . W .
