Structures and pathways for clathrin self - assembly in the bulk and on membranes Richard Matthews * and Christos N . Likos We present a coarse - grained model of clathrin that is simple enough to be computationally tractable yet includes key observed qualitative features : a triskelion structure with excluded volume between legs ; assembly of polymorphic cages in the bulk ; formation of buds on a membrane . We investigate the assembly of our model using both Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics with hydrodynamic interactions , in the latter employing a new membrane boundary condition . In the bulk , a range of known clathrin structures are assembled . A membrane budding pathway involving the coalescence of multiple small clusters is identi ﬁ ed . 1 Introduction Clathrin 1 is a triskelion - shaped protein that self - assembles into a broad range of polymorphic structures . On the one hand , its key function is in forming coated vesicles , separated from membranes through budding , that are crucial for intra - cellular transport . 2 On the other hand , its three - legged shape lets it also form extended hexagonal sheets . 3 In vivo , clathrin assembly is always associated with membranes : it is attached to them by intermediary protein complexes called adaptors . Assembly of cages may also be observed in in vitro experi - ments without a membrane : early work 5 found that the result - ing cages were much more homogeneous when adaptor proteins were present . A number of closed - cage structures have been identi  ed , all having twelve pentagonal faces and ( N (cid:1) 20 ) / 2 hexagonal faces , where N is the number of triskelia . These include one structure with N ¼ 28 , called a mini - coat , two with N ¼ 36 , given the names hexagonal barrel and tennis ball , and a truncated icosahedron with N ¼ 60 . 4 , 6 , 7 Of these , the tennis ball structure , with a closed ring of pentagons reminiscent of the seam on a tennis ball , is less common . The mini - coat , tennis ball and hexagonal barrel structures are illustrated in Fig . 1 . Larger cages may also be formed . Detailed investigation of coated vesicles showed them to be much more polydisperse , including some heptagons , although the tennis ball structure was also observed . 8 Previous modeling of the assembly of structures by cla - thrin 9 , 10 assumed that the triskelia are completely rigid . However , there is evidence , based on analysis of the  uctuations observed in electron micrograph images 11 and the comparison of Brownian dynamics simulations to scattering data , 12 that , in isolation , the legs of the triskelion have a persistence length similar to their contour length z 50 nm . 1 It is however both expected 11 and observed 13 that there is much greater rigidity once the triskelia are bonded into a structure . Each triskelion leg is primarily composed of an extended , curved sub - unit called a heavy chain . 1 Much of the internal construction of the heavy chain comprises zig - zag structures . The leg  exibility within a cage was estimated , through obser - vation of crystal structures , to allow bends of 1 (cid:3) to 2 (cid:3) per zig - zag . 13 This estimate may be too high for the leg overall as it was based on a section known as the linker , which is expected to be more  exible due to a less regular structure . 14 In this work , we present a new clathrin model that includes excluded volume . Each leg is modeled by a sequence of bonded patchy particles .

In computa - tional models , this may be included directly in pair interaction potentials 15 or be produced by composing sub - units of multiple particles . This latter approach may give a more realistic repre - sentation of the shape of sub - units and has been applied to viral capsids , both in studies of self - assembly 16 and in modelling interactions with membranes without assembly , 17 where budding was observed . Viral capsids are perhaps the most intensively studied example of self - assembly and models with single particle sub - units have also been applied . 18 For the case of clathrin , whilst previous work 9 , 10 has also used such simpler models , here our approach is intermediate : sub - units composed of multiple particles whose pair interactions are patchy . Although the exact form of the attractive interaction between clathrin legs is not known , 9 in observed structures 1 they tend to lie close to each other , always having a similar relative orien - tation , suggesting interactions are short range and strongly orientationally dependent . Whilst , particularly for viral capsids , the use of patchy particles to represent protein – protein inter - actions is quite common , 15 , 18 , 19 we furthermore choose to employ them as an e ﬃ cient way to capture the two key inter - action features : short range and strong orientational dependence . In a recent publication , 15 we presented results on the e ﬀ ect of  uctuating membranes on the equilibrium structures of a system of self - assembling patchy colloids . We considered a simple model , representing each clathrin with a single spherical particle with three attractive patches . Here , our use of multiple patchy beads allows , in contrast to previous approaches , 9 , 10 features that are expected to be important in self - assembly to be captured : excluded volume between legs ,  exibility , the interweaving of legs in assembled structures . The rest of the paper is organised as follows . In Section 2 , we describe our model in more detail , including the process used to determine parameters . In Section 3 , we present the results of Monte Carlo ( MC ) 20 simulations to explore the structures that our triskelia may assemble in the bulk , before moving to dynamical simulations to consider the behaviour with a membrane in Section 4 . In Section 5 , we summarise and draw our conclusions , whereas in the Appendix we present some technical details pertaining to the model and the simulation techniques . 2 The clathrin model Our model triskelion comprises 13 bead patchy beads , see Appendix A . 1 , of 5 di ﬀ erent types , denoted a ¼ A – E . One central bead of type A is attached to 3 legs , each consisting of 1 bead each of types B – E , see Fig . 2 . Associated with bead type a are two sets of unit vectors : { v [ a , i ] } and { u [ a , i ] } , where i indexes the di ﬀ erent vectors belonging to one type . { v [ a , i ] } specify the attractive patches for interactions with other triskelia , whereas { u [ a , i ] } de  ne the internal interactions and thus the shape of an isolated triskelion in mechanical equilibrium . A further parameter , d , speci  es the mechanical equilibrium separation between bonded beads of the same triskelion . A detailed description of how the parameters determine the triskelion shape is given in Appendix A . 2 . Considering { v [ a , i ] } , apart from type A , all beads have attractive patches , depicted in Fig . 2 , which are supplemented by a torsional vector ( not shown ) . Moving out from the centre , type B has two patches , whose positions are de  ned by v [ B , 1 ] and v [ B , 2 ] , as does type C . Patches v [ B , 1 ] and v [ C , 1 ] , from di ﬀ erent triskelia , attract each other such that , if the initial parts of two legs are placed approximately antiparallel , and at an appropriate separation , they may bond . The other patches of B and C , v [ B , 2 ] and v [ C , 2 ] , attract the single patches on types D and E , v [ D , 1 ] and v [ E , 1 ] respectively . These interactions are such that , if triskelia form a cage , the second half of a given leg bends under the  rst half of a leg from an adjacent triskelion , whereby “ under ” means towards the centre of the cage , mimicking nature . 1 Our choice of patches for the di ﬀ erent beads , and of the speci  city of their interactions , is made so that the parts of the legs that are observed to lie next to each other in clathrin structures 1 will attract each other in our model . There are excluded volume interactions between all beads not belonging to the same triskelion . The shape of the triskelion is maintained by internal interactions : harmonic springs with equilibrium length d and spring constant k between bonded beads , plus bending and torsional sti ﬀ ness . We choose the bending and torsional rigidity to be the same , speci  ed by the parameter k . The equilibrium angles between subsequent bonds along a leg are encoded in the { u [ a , i ] } vectors . Full de  nition of the interaction potentials for both external and internal interactions is given in the Appendices A . 1 and A . 2 respectively . The extended nature of the legs , and the speci  city of the attractive patches , gives the overall interaction between two triskelia orientational dependence . This is further enforced at a bead – bead interaction level through the torsional vectors , see Appendix A . 1 . The parameters of triskelion shape and patch vectors are not set a priori but they are rather speci  ed through an informed search procedure . The basic idea of our parameter -  nding scheme is the following : hold a set of objects in a desired con  guration , which here will be the hexagonal barrel comprising 36 triskelia , and allow the parameters determining the interactions between these objects to vary until they have found a low energy minimum . We assume that if the interaction Fig . 2 Depiction of a triskelion comprised of beads type a ¼ A – E , with patches whose positions are de ﬁ ned by { v [ a , i ] } . There are attractive interactions between di ﬀ erent triskelia , between patches v [ B , 1 ] and v [ C , 1 ] , patches v [ B , 2 ] and v [ D , 1 ] and patches v [ C , 2 ] and v [ E , 1 ] . Note that all legs are identical . This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Soft Matter , 2013 , 9 , 5794 – 5806 | 5795 Paper Soft Matter P ub li s h e d on 15 M a y 2013 .

View Article Online parameters are then  xed , they will drive the objects to reform the structure from a random initial condition . We use the term “ free assembly ” to refer to simulations where interaction parameters are  xed . For free assembly simulations we consider both random and pre - assembled initial conditions . Whilst in the latter , strong interactions may cause to triskelia to remain in their initial con  guration , unlike in the parameter -  nding , triskelia may in principle explore other structures . The parameters for triskelion shape { u [ a , i ] } , patch position { v [ a , i ] } , and bead separation d were chosen using Metropolis MC simulations , in which these parameters , along with the usual system coordinates , were treated as dynamical variables . Updates were made using trial moves with the standard acceptance criterion . 20 Schematically , a Hamiltonian H * ( X , d * , V * , U * ) was used to determine the parameters , which were then input to the Hamiltonian H ( X ; d , V , U ) for free assembly simulations . V and U represent the set of all parameter vectors for all bead types and X represents the usual system coordi - nates . For H , the values of d , V and U are  xed . The corre - sponding variables in H * , d * , V * and U * may vary freely . Simulations of H * ( X , d * , V * , U * ) were performed at low temperature , k B T (cid:4) 3 tt , where (cid:1) 3 tt is the minimum of the attractive interaction between beads , so that the system relaxed to a low - energy minimum . Here k B T is the energy appearing in the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo acceptance probability , 20 min [ 1 , exp ( (cid:1) D E / k B T ) ] , where D E is the change in the energy due to a trial move . Additional constraints were applied to ensure the minimum found corresponded to the desired structure . To extract parameter values for use in simulations with H ( X ; d , V , U ) , thermal averages of the corre - sponding variables around the minimum were performed . To simplify the minimisation , during the interaction  nding stage , all triskelia always had a con  guration corresponding to the minimum of their internal interactions , see Appendix A . 3 for more details . A common self - assembled shape observed in in vitro exper - iments with clathrin is the hexagonal barrel 7 and we chose this as our target structure . Clearly , a di ﬀ erent choice of target structure would lead to a somewhat di ﬀ erent set of interaction parameters but , given its frequency in bulk assembly experi - ments , the hexagonal barrel is a reasonable choice . We furthermore emphasise , however , that , in free assembly runs ( see Section 3 ) , our triskelia were also able to self - assemble into di ﬀ erent structures . Multiple parameter -  nding runs at di ﬀ erent temperatures were observed to give very similar parameters , see Appendix A . 3 . The set of parameters used in our free assembly simulations is given in Appendix A . 3 . The state found cannot be guaranteed to correspond to the global minimum for a hexagonal barrel . However , given the tightness of the packing of the triskelia observed in the  nal structure , it is a reasonable assumption that the con  guration is the unique minimum for triskelia interacting in the desired way , with initial parts of legs lying side - by - side and antiparallel , and the end parts of legs tucked inside the cage . We set the parameter for the harmonic springs between beads , which is not varied , to k ¼ 1 . 6 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T , and consider di ﬀ erent bending sti ﬀ nesses , k and patch attraction strengths , 3 tt . Our simple model represents only those two sections of a leg , which when assembled run along two polyhedron edges . In the corresponding section of a true triskelion leg there are z 20 zig - zags . 1 We primarily consider bending sti ﬀ ness parameters of k ¼ 0 . 8 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T , 1 . 6 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T and 3 . 2 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T . k ¼ 0 . 8 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T gives a typical angular de  ection per bending joint of z 3 (cid:3) . Since there are eight joints in a leg , one at each end of each internal bond , see Appendix A . 2 , this gives a total possible de  ection per leg similar to that expected from crystal structure observations . 1 , 13 We also considered complete rigidity , applied also to the springs joining beads , as well as  exibility similar to that seen for isolated triskelia . In the latter case we found assembly of disordered and extended structures rather than cages and results are not presented . It should be noted , however , that the structures found for sti ﬀ er triskelia will also represent local minima for the  exible ones , although in this case our free assembly simulations were unable to  nd them . 3 Bulk self - assembly We next consider the structures formed by our clathrin - model without a membrane . For these free assembly simulations , we employ Metropolis Monte Carlo with a range of moves to improve sampling , including aggregate volume bias , 21 con  gu - rational bias , 22 cluster moves , 23 hybrid MC 24 and multicanonical parallel tempering . 25 To form closed cages , triskelia must be able to bond and form faces surrounded by both 5 - and 6 - edge loops . This  exibility , which is automatically built into our model through the parameter choosing procedure , means that the triskelia may explore a broad range of competing low - energy minima . Whilst we expect the global minimum to be a closed cage , simulations may easily become trapped in other states and , despite the range of MC moves utilised , we  nd that simulations are not able to move between all of the local minima on a feasible timescale . Nonetheless , the free assembly simulations do give us reliable information about the structures that our model may assemble . We ran free assembly simulations with N ¼ 36 triskelia , starting from two initial con  gurations : one with triskelia placed randomly , just with the requirement of no beads over - lapping , and the other with an assembled hexagonal barrel . 24 systems with di ﬀ erent 3 tt between 3 . 3 k B T and 4 . 91 k B T were run with parallel tempering swaps between them . In the majority of simulations , umbrella sampling with an iteratively calculated weighting function , 25 w ( U tt / 3 tt ) , where U tt is the total inter - triskelion interaction energy , was used but some runs were also performed without . We  rst , in Fig . 3 , present results from individual free assembly simulations for various quanti - ties as a function of 3 tt . Fig . 3 ( a ) shows the average inter - triskelion interaction energy , h U tt i . For low 3 tt , the results , at least for  exible tris - kelia , are similar for both assembled and unassembled initial con  gurations . However , for higher 3 tt , the results for the assembled initial condition clearly show lower energies , indicating that proper sampling of equilibrium is not ach - ieved . The point at which assembly starts is at higher 3 tt for more  exible triskelia , due to the larger loss of entropy .

View Article Online the asphericity 26 of the largest cluster , h D i , broadly similar results are seen for both initial conditions , with h D i changing from z 1 indicating highly aspherical structures when there is little assembly to z 0 indicating almost spherical structures at high 3 tt . In calculating the asphericity , the positions of the central , type A beads were used . When there are no bonded triskelia in the system and thus the largest “ cluster ” is a single triskelion , the asphericity , which is calculated from a tensor based on the separations of pairs of beads , 26 is not de  ned . Since , when the largest cluster is of size 2 , which is necessarily a line , D ¼ 1 , we choose to assign a value of D ¼ 1 for a single triskelion also . Much larger di ﬀ erences are seen in Fig . 3 ( c ) – ( f ) , where the probability of observing speci  c structures is considered . Here we plot the probabilities on logarithmic scales , down to very small values . These very low probabilities arise from the umbrella sampling : during the creation of the weighting func - tion the system may become trapped in some con  guration , eventually the weighting function will become large enough to allow the system to escape and explore other structures . However , due to the large weighting function , the estimated probability of these structures is very low . Since we know our simulations are not fully sampling equilibrium , these proba - bilities may well be severely underestimated . We check whether a bonded cluster has one of the four common structures – mini - coat , hexagonal barrel , tennis ball or truncated icosahedron – by using an algorithm 27 to test if the graph formed by considering the bonds between triskelia is isomorphic to the one of the corresponding graphs . We identify two beads from di ﬀ erent triskelia as being bonded if their interaction energy is \ (cid:1) 1 4 3 tt . Two triskelia are then de  ned to be bonded if there exists at least one bond between their type B and type C beads . For the unassembled initial condition , we  nd that , overall , the most likely structure to be formed is the mini - coat , see Fig . 3 ( c ) , both for simulations with and without umbrella sampling . At higher values of 3 tt , some initially unassembled simulations did also form hexagonal barrel structures , consis - tent with the fact that interactions were chosen for this struc - ture at low temperature , and also tennis ball structures , see Fig . 3 ( d ) and ( e ) . In Fig . 3 ( f ) we show the probability of forming closed structures that have twelve pentagonal faces and ( N (cid:1) 20 ) / 2 hexagonal faces , but which are not one of the known structures that we test for . These other structures that arose in our simulations had 32 triskelia . No closed structures with a di ﬀ erent number of pentagonal and hexagonal faces were formed , although there were additionally many open structures . For the assembled initial condition we found that the only closed structure seen in the simulation was the hexagonal barrel . We also ran free assembly simulations with 60 triskelia but no truncated icosahedra were assembled although , when pre - assembled , they were stable for higher 3 tt . In Fig . 4 we show snapshots of mini - coat , hexagonal barrel and tennis ball structures assembled in our simulations , as well as a truncated icosahedron structure . To obtain more information about the relative stability of the di ﬀ erent structures , also for higher 3 tt , we consider , in Fig . 5 , the average internal energy of a given structure divided by the number of triskelia in the structure , compared to the value for a hexagonal barrel . Simulations were run at single 3 tt values from 4 . 91 k B T to 19 . 91 k B T with only local moves . The initial condition was taken as the assembled structure and for all simulations , expect in one case , this structure persisted for the rest of the simulation : for the lowest 3 tt the structure was intermittently not identi  ed according to our bonding de  ni - tion , though only temporarily , indicating that true disassembly Fig . 3 Average values as a function of 3 tt from single MC free assembly simulations with di ﬀ erent ﬂ exibilities : k ¼ 0 . 8 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T ( red ) , k ¼ 1 . 6 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T ( green ) , k ¼ 3 . 2 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T ( blue ) , rigid ( magenta ) .

For rigid triskelia , the mini - coat with 3 tt ¼ 4 . 91 k B T was not stable . Although the overall structure did not disassemble , typically multiple bonds within the structure broke and did not reform within the simulation . It should be noted , however , that , given the mini - coat did persist for some time , and also given it was formed in some free assembly simulations with rigid triskelia , see Fig . 3 ( c ) , at 3 tt ¼ 4 . 91 k B T the mini - coat must still represent a local minimum for the rigid triskelia . We  nd that , usually , the hexagonal barrel has the lowest internal energy per triskelion , as expected since the parameters were determined for this structure . We  nd that the di ﬀ erence becomes more positive as the rigidity is increased but , for the highest two  exibilities , the tennis ball has lower internal energy per triskelion than the hexagonal barrel at some 3 tt . The mini - coat has values relatively close to those for the hexagonal barrel but the truncated icosahedron has signi  cantly higher values for all 3 tt considered . We observe that the di ﬀ erence relative to 3 tt decreases as 3 tt increases since the attractions dominate more over the bending rigidity but that for completely rigid triskelia the curves  atten out . 4 Self - assembly on a membrane : hydrodynamics and bud formation Clathrin is intrinsically linked to membranes , and in vivo it is here that its self - assembly occurs . 2 As discussed in Section 1 , the structures formed on a membrane are more polydisperse than those assembled in the bulk and it is expected that the  uctu - ating surface will also change the pathways to assembly . In this section , we consider the assembly of our triskelia when they are attracted to a  uctuating membrane . In the terms used in the previous section , all the simulations with a membrane in this section are free assembly ones . We represent the membrane as a dynamically triangulated surface composed of bonded particles with a typical bond length of s . 28 Membrane  uidity is included by MC moves , performed at regular intervals , that attempt to  ip bonds between neighbouring particles . The rate of bond -  ipping sets the viscosity of the membrane , which may be measured by considering a Poiseuille  ow in a two - dimensional membrane sheet , see Appendix A . 4 . 28 Since free assembly simulations without a membrane indi - cated that our MC approach is unable to fully sample equilib - rium , we proceed directly to dynamical simulations . We perform molecular dynamics simulations with our triskelia , as well as the membrane , coupled to a Stochastic Rotation Dynamics ( SRD ) solvent . 29 SRD is a coarse - grained method in which the  uid is represented by point particles of mass m whose interactions are e ﬀ ected by dividing the system into a grid of cells at regular time intervals and exchanging momentum by a rotation through a certain angle of velocities relative to the cell centre of mass velocity . This acts as a ther - mostat , whilst also conserving momentum so that hydrody - namic interactions are included . More details of parameter choices and solute – solvent couplings are given in Appendix A . 5 . Hydrodynamic interactions are naturally present in real , experimental systems and may have both qualitative and quantitative e ﬀ ects . 30 Although we do not investigate the e ﬀ ect of hydrodynamic interactions in detail , we choose a simulation method that includes them , as this is expected to be more dynamically realistic . Since SRD requires the simulation box to be regularly divided into a grid with an integer number of cells , it is incompatible with the approach to simulating a tensionless membrane employed in our previous work without solvent 15 that involved box - rescaling . We therefore have developed a new Fig . 4 Assembled structures : ( a ) Mini - coat with N ¼ 28 triskelia . ( b ) Hexagonal barrel , N ¼ 36 . ( c ) Tennis ball , N ¼ 36 .

View Article Online approach , detailed in Appendix A . 4 , in which the edge of the membrane is bonded to a square frame , whose sides are a distance r frame from the edges of the simulation box . The frame may expand and contract . We de  ne a unit of simulation time , t 0 ¼ s ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k B T = m p . Our parameter choices give a membrane viscosity of h m ¼ 35 . 1 (cid:6) 0 . 1 m / t 0 and a  uid viscosity of h f ¼ 2 . 5 m / s t 0 , see Appendices A . 4 and A . 5 . The ratio of the viscosities is l h ¼ h m / h f z 14 s . For a lipid bilayer in water , l h ¼ 1 – 10 m m . 31 The typical size of a triskelion is on the order of 0 . 1 m m , whereas in our simulation it is a few s . Thus the size of a triskelion compared to l h is close to the lower end of the expected range , allowing e ﬃ cient simulation . As for the MC simulations , we consider triskelion sti ﬀ nesses of k ¼ 0 . 8 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T , 1 . 6 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T and 3 . 2 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T and we consider membrane bending sti ﬀ nesses of l b ¼ 2 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T , 4 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T and 8 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T . See Appendix A . 4 for the de  nition of the bending potential . Interactions of clathrin triskelia with membranes occur at the ends of the triskelion legs 13 via inter - mediary adaptor proteins . We neglect the adaptor proteins and simply introduce an attractive interaction between the  nal beads in the legs and membrane particles , with a minimum of (cid:1) 3 mt . Unlike for triskelion – triskelion interactions , this attrac - tion is not patchy but the bead – bead and membrane – bead potentials share a common radial form . We consider 3 mt ¼ k B T and 2 k B T , and 3 tt ¼ 5 k B T and 10 k B T . We simulate 300 triskelia , 1156 membrane particles and z 5 (cid:5) 10 5 SRD particles in a box of 45 s (cid:5) 45 s (cid:5) 45 s with periodic boundaries . The relatively high triskelion density , about 10 times that used in previous work , 9 is chosen such that assembly proceeds quickly but we do not expect it to qualita - tively a ﬀ ect assembly on the membrane . An equilibration period with purely repulsive interactions of 3 (cid:5) 10 3 t 0 , chosen to be su ﬃ cient to allow the membrane to relax , was allowed before the system was simulated with attractions for 2 . 5 (cid:5) 10 4 t 0 . For most parameter choices , the triskelia assembled on the membrane , causing the membrane to form a bud , see Fig . 6 . The example in Fig . 6 shows the formation of a relatively defect - free , approximately spherical cage on the membrane . O  en , however , the cages formed had defects or gaps of varying sizes , see Fig . 7 ( a ) . Additionally , some runs produced structures with two largely separate cages attached to one bud , causing a double - headed structure , see Fig . 7 ( b ) . Similarly lumpy struc - tures have been observed experimentally in clathrin assembly . 32 We found that r frame was a good indicator of whether budding had occurred , moving to higher values as membrane area was taken into the bud and the frame contracted . In Fig . 8 we plot h r frame i against time for a variety of parameters . We  rst note that the results for di ﬀ erent k are similar and also that the rate of bud formation did not show strong dependence on 3 tt . In contrast , the rate of bud formation did depend on the values of 3 mt and l b . For the stronger attraction of the triskelia to the membrane , 3 mt ¼ 2 k B T , the rate of bud formation was similar all l b considered and the results were also similar for 3 mt ¼ k B T with l b ¼ 2 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T . However , with the weaker attraction to the membrane , 3 mt ¼ k B T , when the sti ﬀ ness of the membrane was increased to l b ¼ 4 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T , the rate was signi  cantly slower , although clear buds were formed . Increasing the membrane sti ﬀ ness further to l b ¼ 8 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T , again with 3 mt ¼ k B T , no clear buds were formed within 2 . 5 (cid:5) 10 4 t 0 , although caps on the Fig . 6 Snapshots for assembly on a membrane with k ¼ 0 . 8 (cid:5) 10 3 k B T , l b ¼ 8 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T , 3 tt ¼ 5 k B T and 3 mt ¼ 2 k B T .

The assembly of extended  at sheets as in previous work 15 did not occur . A typical pathway to bud formation was for multiple smaller clusters to form on the membrane , see for example the second snapshots in Fig . 6 ( a ) and ( b ) , and then coalesce , leading to a more rapid increase in the membrane curvature and bud formation , see for example the third and fourth snapshots in Fig . 6 ( a ) and ( b ) . For many runs , though not all , the footprint of this pathway could be seen by comparing the number of tris - kelia in the largest cluster in the system , N max , and r frame as a function of time . As may be seen by comparing Fig . 9 ( a ) and ( b ) the most rapid increase in r frame is correlated with a rapid increase in N max , corresponding to smaller clusters joining together . We  nally , in Fig . 10 , plot the distribution of the number of edges in the closed loops surrounding faces formed by assem - bled triskelia at the end of the simulation . It should be noted that this includes a contribution from assembly in the bulk as well as on the membrane , although this should be similar for all 3 mt and l b and was small , as may be seen from the results for Fig . 8 Average over 5 independent runs of r frame against time for di ﬀ erent parameters .

Although large variation was seen , generally more loops with 5 edges than loops with 6 edges were formed . For some parameters , 7 - edge loops were formed . 5 Conclusions We have introduced a new clathrin model using patchy beads that allows the inclusion of excluded volume and  exibility , as well as the interweaving of triskelia in assembled structures . Further , we have also described an approach to producing parameters for the model that will allow the assembly of similar structures to those seen in nature . Choosing the hexagonal barrel as a target structure , we employed our approach to  nd a parameter set . MC simulations using these parameters showed that the triskelia could assemble a hexa - gonal barrel , as well as other structures observed in nature : the mini - coat and the tennis ball . Additionally , further structures were formed with di ﬀ erent numbers of triskelia but also with 12 pentagonal and ( N (cid:1) 20 ) / 2 hexagonal faces , where N is the number of triskelia . The MC simulations were found to not be able to access all of the various local minima within one run . The mini - coat , hexagonal barrel , tennis ball , as well as truncated icosahedron structures were found to be mechan - ically stable for a range of triskelion sti ﬀ nesses , for su ﬃ cient attraction strengths . Dynamical simulations of the assembly of the model tris - kelia with an attractive  uctuating membrane , employing a new membrane boundary condition , were performed with coupling to a coarse - grained solvent to include hydrodynamic interactions . For most parameters , the formation of buds by the assembly of the triskelia on the membrane surface was found . The buds were surrounded by cages with pentagonal , hexagonal and sometimes heptagonal faces . They o  en con - tained defects or holes and sometimes had lumpy , double - headed structures . Our model takes into consideration key characteristics of clathrin , such as excluded volume ,  exibility and binding site selectivity , whilst at the same time remaining computationally tractable . It is capable of reproducing the salient observed features of the protein : the assembly and stability of known structures and the formation of buds on a membrane . Whilst the smaller number of beads used in the current model is advantageous for simulation , its success suggests it could be interesting in further work to consider a similar model with a  ner coarse - graining , that might be able to capture even more features . A similar approach might also be applied to some of the other proteins that attach to the membrane during budding , 33 and it could be very interesting to model their collaborative binding . A Appendix We present additional details of our model and methods . Many features of our model are similar to our previous work 15 and , correspondingly , parts of the descriptions in this Appendix are very similar to parts of the ESI in ref . 15 . They are nonetheless reproduced here for the convenience of the reader . A . 1 Triskelion – triskelion interactions We  rst discuss the form of the triskelion – triskelion , tt , inter - actions , which have the same radial form as the triskelion – membrane particle , mt , interactions . The potential form is similar to that used in earlier work . 19 For two di ﬀ erent particles , i and j , separated by r ij ¼ | r ij | ¼ | r j (cid:1) r i | , where r i is position of particle i , the general form for both these types of interactions is , U ij ¼ g area [ U WCA ( r ij ) + g att g orient U att ( r ij ) ] U WCA ð r Þ ¼ 4 3 (cid:3)(cid:4) s r (cid:5) 12 (cid:1) (cid:4) s r (cid:5) 6 þ 1 4 (cid:6) for r \ r t ; 0 for r $ r t ; 8 > < > : U att ð r Þ ¼ (cid:1) 3 for r \ r t ; 4 3 " (cid:4) s r (cid:5) 12 (cid:1) (cid:4) s r (cid:5) 6 # for r t # r # r s ; a ð r (cid:1) r c Þ 2 þ b ð r (cid:1) r c Þ 3 for r s # r # r c ; 0 for r $ r c ; 8 > > > > > > > > < > > > > > > > > : ( 1 ) where r t ¼ 2 1 / 6 s , r s ¼ (cid:4) 26 7 (cid:5) 1 = 6 s , r c ¼ 67 48 r s , a ¼ (cid:1) 24 192 3211 3 r s2 and b ¼ (cid:1) 387 072 61 009 3 r s3 . The form of U att ( r ) in the range r s # r # r c is a polynomial interpolation used to avoid a jump in the potential or its  rst derivative at the cut - o ﬀ . 35 The energy scale , 3 , is set to 3 tt for triskelion – triskelion interactions . The dimensionless factors g area , g att and g orient take di ﬀ erent forms for tt and mt interactions . For tt interactions g area ¼ 1 . The patches on triskelion beads are given identities and only speci  c pairs are attractive , as detailed in the main text . For a pair of interacting triskelion beads from di ﬀ erent triskelia , if the pair of closest patches are attractive then g att ¼ 1 , otherwise g att ¼ 0 . The factor g orient allows the attractive part of the interaction to be made patchy . For tt - interactions the centres of the attractive patches are de  ned by unit vectors . For a given bead of type a , the relative directions of these are given by the { v [ a , i ] } parameters . The width of the patches is determined by g orient , which is a product of functions of the form : 36 F ð f ; f a ; f b Þ ¼ 1 for f # f a ; cos 2 ½ð p = 2 Þð f (cid:1) f a Þ = f b (cid:7) for f a # f # f a þ f b ; 0 for f $ f a þ f b : 8 > < > : ( 2 ) g orient ( r ^ ij , U i , U j ) ¼ F ( q i ; q a , q b ) (cid:5) F ( q j ; q a , q b ) (cid:5) F ( j ij ; 2 q a , 2 q b ) , where U describes particle orientation . q i is the angle between the interacting patch on particle i and r ^ ij , whilst q j is between the patch of particle j and (cid:1) r ^ ij . j ij is the angle between the projec - tions of the external torsional vectors of i and j onto the plane perpendicular to r ^ ij .

We follow ref . 19 in choosing the range for this factor to be double that for the other ones . We choose q a ¼ 0 . 3 and q b ¼ 0 . 2 . The same geometry as for the external patchy interactions is also used for the internal interactions , see Fig . 11 . A . 2 Triskelion internal interactions We next de  ne the internal interactions between bonded beads within the same triskelion . Similarly to the external attractive patchy interactions , these are based on unit vectors associated with the bonded bead types . For a given bead of type a their relative directions are given by the { u [ a , i ] } parameters . Fig . 11 depicts how the vectors are used to determine a set of angles between a pair of bonded beads . For these internal interactions , we denote the vectors whose angles to the bead - to - bead vector are considered as bending vectors , whilst the vectors whose rotations around it are considered are denoted internal torsional vectors . It should be noted that the torsional vectors for external and internal interactions are not the same . A potential is then applied , U internal ¼ 1 2 k ð r (cid:1) d Þ 2 þ k ð 1 (cid:1) cos ð q 1 ÞÞ þ k ð 1 (cid:1) cos ð q 2 ÞÞ þ k ð 1 (cid:1) cos ð j 12 ÞÞ , where r is the bead separation , q 1 and q 2 are angles between the bending vectors from the two beads respectively and the centre - to - centre vector . j 12 is the angle between the projections of the two internal torsional vectors from the beads onto the plane perpendicular to the bead - to - bead vector . A . 3 Triskelion parameter determination We next give more details of the simulations used to determine triskelion parameters . 36 triskelia were placed with their centres on the vertices of a hexagonal barrel of edge length l hex , although it should be noted that the hexagonal barrel structure cannot be formed from regular hexagons and pentagons 4 and so there is some ambiguity as to the exact positions . Initial values for { v * [ a , i ] } , { u * [ a , i ] } and d were chosen by hand so that tris - kelia pairs interact in approximately the desired way . For the initial part of the simulation , triskelion centre positions remained  xed , except in updates of l hex with a corresponding radial displacement of all centres . Further moves , summarised in Fig . 12 , included varying d between 0 . 5 (cid:5) 2 1 / 6 s and 1 . 3 (cid:5) 2 1 / 6 s , as well as updates of { v * [ a , i ] } and { u * [ a , i ] } , and rigid - body rotations around triskelion centres . Due to the uncertainty about vertex positions , in the latter stages of the simulation , once the system energy was < 50 % of the possible minimum , the triskelion centres were allowed to move freely . Our triskelion model is unchanged by the application of an arbitrary rotation to all vectors associated with a bead type : since the internal interactions between di ﬀ erent beads  x their relative orientations , only the directions of the vectors for a particular type relative to each other are important . It is thus necessary to constrain some vectors during interaction -  nding simulations . Without loss of freedom , for each bead type B – E , we chose to  x the bending vector used for the interaction with the previous bead in the leg . Additionally , the internal torsional vector for type A , which lies on its axis of symmetry , was  xed , and the three bending vectors of A for interactions with B beads were constrained to not rotate around the symmetry axis . The internal interaction vectors for bead type A were such that there was a threefold rotational symmetry axis through the centre . If such constraints were not applied , vectors would be able to explore all directions and their average would be become unde  ned . Furthermore , even with the constraints already outlined , there is a large degeneracy in possible torsional vectors , both for internal and external interactions . Therefore , internal torsional vectors , for all bead types except A , were adjusted for each con  guration to make them as close to perpendicular to the bending vectors as possible , without altering the resulting triskelion . Furthermore , the external Fig . 11 Sketch to illustrate the use of the unit vectors associated with bonded beads in a triskelion in calculating the internal interactions between those beads . The bending potential depends on the angles between the vectors terminating in circles , denotedbendingvectors , andthebead - to - beadvector . Thetorsionpotential depends on the angles between the projections of the two vectors terminating in diamonds , denoted internal torsional vectors , onto the plane perpendicular to the bead - to - bead vector . For a given bead of type a the relative directions of the di ﬀ erent vectors for internal interactions are de ﬁ ned by the { u [ a , i ] } parameters .

View Article Online torsional vector for bead type B was taken to be v * [ B , 2 ] (cid:5) v * [ B , 1 ] / | v * [ B , 2 ] (cid:5) v * [ B , 1 ] | . For the other external torsional vectors , a minimum angle between attractive patch vectors and their corresponding torsional vector was imposed . Not all interaction -  nding simulations were found to converge to a low - energy minimum with all patches interacting as desired . Therefore , an intermediate con  guration from a successful simulation , for which all patches were interacting , was chosen as a starting point for further simulations . These were run with 3 repeats each at k B T ¼ 10 (cid:1) 2 , 10 (cid:1) 3 and 10 (cid:1) 4 3 tt . At a given k B T , all simulations were found to converge to states  uctuating around the same energy value . As expected , these energy values , and the size of the  uctuations , both relative to 3 tt , decreased with decreasing k B T . All were within a range of z 3 tt around (cid:1) 310 3 tt , compared to a possible minimum of (cid:1) 324 3 tt if each attractive patch on each triskelion interacted with one other patch and all these interactions were minimised . Sets of parameters for free assembly simulations were extracted as thermal averages , taken a  er the simulation had relaxed to the minimum , d ¼ h d * i , { v [ a , i ] } ¼ { h v * [ a , i ] i / | h v * [ a , i ] i | } and { u [ a , i ] } ¼ { h u * [ a , i ] i / | h u * [ a , i ] i | } . The parameters from all simulations at di ﬀ erent k B T were very similar . To test the size of the di ﬀ erences between the di ﬀ erent parameter sets , triskelia de  ned by each were placed , in their mechanical equilibrium con  gurations , with the same centre position and with the centre symmetry vector and the direction of the  rst leg aligned . The maximum distance between corresponding beads in di ﬀ erent triskelia was 7 (cid:5) 10 (cid:1) 3 s and the largest angle between patches was 4 p (cid:5) 10 (cid:1) 3 . The largest angle between torsion vectors was larger , 6 p (cid:5) 10 (cid:1) 2 , due to the larger freedom in choosing these . Given the close similarity , we simply picked one set and veri  ed that these parameters did produce triskelia that can form a hexagonal barrel with energy z (cid:1) 310 3 tt for low k B T . We give the parameters used in our free assembly simula - tions . The equilibrium separation between internally bonded triskelion beads was d ¼ 0 . 81597 s , to 5 decimal places . The vector parameters used for de  ning internal , { u [ a , i ] } , and external , { v [ a , i ] } , interactions are given in Tables 1 and 2 respectively .

View Article Online approach of using box - rescaling for simulating a tensionless membrane from our previous work without solvent 15 is not suitable . We therefore simulate the membrane by restricting a number , N border , of particles , denoted border particles , to a frame with a con  ning potential . These form the edge of the membrane . Other , bulk , particles do not experience the con  ning potential . Furthermore , bonds between membrane particles are also of border and bulk types , where the border bonds are always between two border particles and always form a single closed ring . The bonding potential for both bond types is the same . The position of the frame is given by a variable r frame that de  nes how far in from the edges of the simulation box it is , see Fig . 13 . In the direction out of the plane of the frame a  at - potential region extends for 4 s . In the plane it extends 0 . 5 s inwards and outwards from the frame position , see Fig . 13 . In the  at - potential region , border membrane particles have an energy of E frame . The con  ning potential for the border membrane particles is of the same form , range and strength as the excluded volume between membrane particles , U confine ð r Þ ¼ (cid:12) E frame þ ð 80 k B T Þ exp ½(cid:1) 1 = r (cid:7) = ð 0 : 18 s (cid:1) r Þ for 0 \ r \ 0 : 18 s ; N for r $ 0 : 18 s ; ( 5 ) where r is the distance of the border membrane particle from the closest point within the  at - potential region . As summarised in Fig . 14 , we employ two types of MC moves to allow the membrane to expand and contract : those that convert border particles to bulk particle and vice versa , as well as those that change r frame , moving the frame inwards or outwards from the simulation box centre . The total number of bonds and triangles , N tri , in the membrane may thus vary . Maximum and minimum values of r frame are imposed such that the con  ning potentials from opposite sides of the frame do not overlap , and also such that the con  ning potential does not extend across the periodic boundaries . The value of E frame controls r frame and N border : if it is made very high the membrane will try to minimise N border , and consequently r frame will increase as the membrane is squeezed , forcing it to extend out of the plane . On the other hand , if E frame is made very low , N border will become large and r frame small , and the central region of the membrane will be stretched into a  at con  guration . To determine E frame for a particular membrane sti ﬀ ness , we simulated membranes with a range of E frame and compared the ratio of the area to the area projected onto the plane of the frame , A / A proj , to the value measured for a tensionless membrane simulated with box - rescaling . 15 To minimise the e ﬀ ect of the frame , we only considered the part of the membrane with a projection falling within the central 10 % of the area de  ned by the frame . A unit normal vector is associated with each membrane triangle . Each bulk bond forms the side of two di ﬀ erent neighboring triangles . Membrane  uidity is included using MC moves that attempt to remove a given bulk bond and create a new one between the two vertices of its neighboring triangles that were not connected by the original . During dynamical Fig . 13 Sketchofa section ofthe framein a simulationbox , showing a cut in the plane of the frame . The outer , short - dashed line shows the periodic boundaries of the simulation box . The centre of the frame , shown by the long - dashed line is located a distance r frame inwards from this . There is a region where border membrane particles experience a ﬂ at potential , extending 0 . 5 s in either direction from this , shown by the light grey area . In the dark grey area , the border membrane particles experience a con ﬁ ning potential that diverges at the edge further from the ﬂ at region . In the direction out of the plane ( not shown ) the ﬂ at - potential region extends 4 s . Fig . 14 Sketch of the membrane boundary conditions used for dynamics simulations . Membrane particles are of two types : border ( open circles ) and bulk ( ﬁ lled circles ) , as are membrane bonds : border ( loopy lines ) and bulk ( straight lines ) . Intheshaded region , borderparticlesexperienceacon ﬁ ningpotentialwith a ﬂ at minimum regionwith energy E frame , bulk particles feel no potential . Every so often , Monte Carlo updates of two types are performed : ( a and b ) the position of the frame within the simulation box ( dotted line ) is shifted inwards or outwards . ( c and d ) Bulk particles are converted to border particles , see highlighted area , or vice versa . Only bulk particles that are bonded to two current border particles , which are themselves bonded , may be converted . A corresponding bond creation ( deletion ) , along with a conversion of existing bonds from bulk to border ( border to bulk ) ensures that each border particle has two , and only two , border bonds to two other border particles , and that the bonds between all the border particles form a closed ring . A double bond between the same two particles may not be created and a border bond may only be deleted if the particle that thus becomes part of the border was originally a bulk particle . 5804 | Soft Matter , 2013 , 9 , 5794 – 5806 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Soft Matter Paper P ub li s h e d on 15 M a y 2013 .

View Article Online simulations , a number of moves equal to the number of bulk bonds are performed every 0 . 1 t 0 . By simulating a Poiseuille  ow for a two - dimensional membrane , 28 we estimate the resulting viscosity of the membrane to be 35 . 1 (cid:6) 0 . 1 m / t 0 . During the bond -  ipping procedure , the direction of the normals is always maintained such that , if the membrane were in a  at con  gu - ration , all normals would be aligned . The bending sti ﬀ ness of the membrane is controlled by including a potential U bend ¼ l b ( 1 (cid:1) n i $ n j ) for each bond , where n i and n j are the unit normal vectors of the two triangles neighboring the bond and l b is an energy . The total membrane area , A , is constrained with a harmonic potential , U area ¼ ( k B T ) ( A (cid:1) A 0 ) 2 , where A 0 ¼ ð ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p = 4 Þ l 2 N tri , in the Hamiltonian . Addition - ally , a bending potential of the same form is applied to triangles with a border bond as one of their edges , where the unit normal of the triangle is compared to a unit normal to the frame - plane . In our dynamical simulations , a series of MC moves , each changing r frame by D r frame or N border by (cid:6) 1 , were performed every 0 . 1 t 0 . On average there were 10 3 attempted changes to r frame and 10 N mem attempted moves to change N border . The acceptance ratio for the r frame - moves showed some dependence on the simulation parameters and also changed somewhat during the course of a simulation , for example as a bud was formed . It was however found to always be roughly in the range 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 . The acceptance ratio for the N border - moves depended on the membrane sti ﬀ ness , ranging from z 5 (cid:5) 10 (cid:1) 2 for l b ¼ 8 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T to z 7 (cid:5) 10 (cid:1) 2 for l b ¼ 2 ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p k B T . A similar , though weaker , dependence was seen for the acceptance ratio of bond  ips , which had a value of z 2 (cid:5) 10 (cid:1) 2 , similar to that seen in previous work with the same membrane model . 28 The rate of N border - moves chosen means there were z 600 such moves accepted every 0 . 1 t 0 . Similarly , there were z 300 r frame - moves accepted . D r frame values are chosen uniformly in the range (cid:1) 0 . 05 s < D r frame < 0 . 05 s so if these z 300 shi  s were an unbiased random walk , r frame would explore a range of z 0 . 2 s . Given that the values of N border and r frame changed by at most z 80 and z 7 s respectively over the course of a 2 . 5 (cid:5) 10 4 t 0 simulation , the rate of N border - and r frame - moves are su ﬃ ciently high that they will adjust the system to the local minimum every 0 . 1 t 0 and their exact values will not a ﬀ ect the results . We next discuss the triskelion – membrane particle interac - tions , the form of which is given in eqn ( 1 ) . For these interac - tions , the energy scale , 3 , is set to 3 mt . Since the membrane bonds have a relatively broad ,  at minimum , the membrane particles would tend to be locally compressed when an attrac - tive triskelion bead is close . For mt interactions the g area factor is used to counter - act this by making the interaction propor - tional to the area that the membrane particle represents : g area ¼ A neigh / ( N neigh A tri ) , where N neigh is the total number of triangles that have the membrane particle as a vertex , A neigh is their total area and A tri ¼ A 0 / N tri . For mt interactions , g att ¼ 0 for triskelion bead types A – D . For bead type E it is used to make only one side of the membrane attract the triskelion beads : it takes a value of 1 if the bead is “ above ” the membrane and 0 if it is “ below ” . A triskelion bead is determined to be “ above ” or “ below ” by  nding the closest point on the membrane . If the normal of the triangle enclosing the closest point makes an angle of less than p / 2 with the vector from the closest point to bead then the bead is “ above ” the membrane , otherwise it is “ below ” . For mt inter - actions g orient ¼ 1 since these are chosen not to be patchy . Since the attractive interaction between triskelia and the membrane depends on which side of the membrane they interact with , a discontinuity in the potential would arise if triskelia could move from one side of the membrane to the other whilst remaining within the interaction range . To avoid this , triskelia experience an excluded volume potential around the frame . So that the total assembly volume available to the triskelia remains approximately constant , the width of the excluded volume region around the frame is rescaled as it moves so its volume is not changed . This excluded region does not generally extended across the entire simulation box . A . 5 SRD We  nally discuss our choice of SRD parameters . The side of the SRD cells was chosen to be equal to s . Both membrane particles and the beads forming triskelia were given masses of 5 m and coupled to the solvent via the collision step . 29 The rotational degrees of freedom of the beads are thus not coupled directly to the solvent but , given the relatively sti ﬀ triskelia we simulate , these relax rapidly anyway . In mechanical equilibrium the separation between the central triskelion bead and the  nal bead of a leg is about 2 . 8 s and that between the  nal beads of di ﬀ erent legs is about 3 . 4 s . A triskelion thus spans many SRD cells and so its rotation as a whole is coupled to the solvent . We chose to have a number density of 5 SRD particles per cell and performed collisions every 0 . 1 t 0 with a rotation angle of p / 2 , giving a viscosity of h ¼ 2 . 5 m / s t 0 . 37 We apply a momentum - conserving cell - level thermostat to the SRD  uid . 29 Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund ( FWF ) : M1367 .
