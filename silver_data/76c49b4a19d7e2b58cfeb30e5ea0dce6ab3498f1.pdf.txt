Background In quantitative research , when we take a sample from a study population or eligible population in order to save our resources , there are two important statistical pro - cesses namely using a probability sampling method ( com - monly known as “random sampling” ) [ 1 ] , and calculating an appropriate sample size [ 2 ] . Both are equally impor - tant to ensure a good representative sample for the study population . As we need a specific statistical analysis for a specific research objective , we also need a specific sample size calculation method for a specific research objective . Even if two research objectives may require a similar statisti - cal analysis , the sample size might be different depend - ing on the parameters that we use for the calculation . In this paper , we focus on the objective that estimates a prevalence or proportion , for example , to estimate the prevalence of obesity , the prevalence of smoking , the prevalence of heart disease , diabetes mellitus or any other diseases of a study population . The method in this paper will not be suitable for other type of objectives such as estimating mean , comparing means , comparing propor - tions or regression analyses . Books [ 3 , 4 ] and published articles [ 5 , 6 ] guiding the methods of sample size calculation for prevalence stud - ies are available . Nevertheless , we observed that several parts of the sample size calculation process can be guided by a software or calculator and it can prevent incorrect calculation , incorrect use of formula , incorrect param - eters , and incomplete sample size reporting . Sample size softwares and calculators are extremely helpful that are available through commercial licenses such as Power Analysis & Sample Size ( PASS ) [ 7 ] , or via freely available softwares such as Epitools [ 8 ] and the “presize” package in R [ 9 ] . However , there are a lot of confusion that still exists , that resulted in users incor - rectly calculating sample size of their studies [ 10 , 11 ] especially the erroneous notion that one blanket formula can be used for all study designs [ 6 ] . In addition , users are Open Access * Correspondence : ayub . sadiq @ ubd . edu . bn ; naing61 @ gmail . com 1 PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences , Universiti Brunei Darussalam , Jalan Tungku Link , Brunei - Muara BE3119 , Gadong , Brunei Darussalam Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 8 Naing et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2022 ) 22 : 209 expected to have some statistical knowledge to calculate and report the sample size calculation . Incorrect sample size calculation could introduce statistical errors that give rise to inaccurate results , which could be serious , par - ticularly in medical research where evidences from these research studies are cornerstones of medical practices [ 12 , 13 ] . Many reasons could be attributed to these con - fusion , inaccuracy , and misunderstanding , in particular , the complexity of available softwares and corresponding guidelines [ 13 ] . Therefore , in this paper , we are addressing these issues by introducing a user - friendly Excel calculator that guides users to use the correct method and parameters step - by - step . This calculator also generates a publication - style report of adequate sample size for users’ study . We believe that , this will improve sample size calculation in future prevalence studies in medical and health sciences . Implementation Method to calculate sample size For an objective that estimates a prevalence , the sample size calculation formula is fairly simple and available in a number of books . The following formula [ 2 ] shall be used : where n = Sample size , Z = Z statistic for a level of confidence ( 1 . 96 for 95 % confidence level ) , P = Expected prevalence or proportion , and . d = Precision . However , we do not encourage researchers to use for - mula as it could have human error in manual calculation . We can use available softwares , and concentrate on care - fully choosing appropriate parameters for the calculation . Appropriately choosing parameters The above formula indicates three parameters to be determined . Parameter 1 : level of confidence When we take a sample but wish to know about the population ( such as preva - lence of smoking ) from where the sample is taken , we will not know the exact prevalence of the population as we do not study all members of the population . However , the sample study gives us an estimation which has lower and upper limits ( informally ‘a range’ , but we call ‘interval’ in Statistics ) for the population prevalence . We normally calculate these lower and upper limits or an interval with a certain level of confidence . Commonly used or almost always used “level of confidence” for these intervals or n = Z 2 P ( 1 − P ) d 2 estimates , is 95 % ( which we called 95 % confidence inter - val , CI ) in medical and health fields . In addition , most data analysis softwares give the results with 95 % CIs by default . For these reasons , and also to minimize users’ error by non - statisticians , we have fixed the level of con - fidence as 95 % without giving users’ choice in these pre - sented calculators . Parameter 2 : precision As mentioned above , we will not know the exact prevalence of the population as we do not study all members of the population . Therefore , the prev - alence we calculate from the sample could deviate ( error ) from the population prevalence . We call this deviation as sampling error . We also know that , the larger the sample size , the smaller the errors in estimation . The errors are calculated as precision or also known as ‘margin of error’ . Practically , the precision reflects the width of 95 % confi - dence interval . If we decide to choose an absolute preci - sion of ± 2 % in estimating a prevalence , we should expect , in the result , the width of 95 % CI as 4 % ( example : 95 % CI : 23 % , 27 % ) . If the absolute precision is ± 5 % in estimating a prevalence , we should expect , in the result , the width of 95 % CI as 10 % ( example : 95 % CI : 20 % , 30 % ) . The width of the CI is twice that of the precision . Details are presented in Table 1 . It is an opportunity for researchers to decide the preci - sion ( margin of error ) and the width of the CI that they wish to see in the results . Normally , researchers wish to have narrower width of CI but the narrower it is , the more expensive ( bigger sample size ) it is going to be . Even if researchers decide to go for a smaller sample size , the researchers can also foresee or appreciate how poor CI width is going to be in their results . Therefore , this is an informed decision to be made by researchers . Practically , we give some recommendations for choos - ing a precision value ( Table 2 ) . In general , well - funded Table 1 Relationship between Precision and width of Confidence Interval ( CI ) Prevalence in Sample Absolute Precision 95 % CI for Population CI Width Required Sample size 25 % ± 2 % ( 23 % , 27 % ) 4 % 1801 25 % ± 5 % ( 20 % , 30 % ) 10 % 289 25 % ± 10 % ( 15 % , 35 % ) 20 % 73 30 % ± 2 % ( 28 % , 32 % ) 4 % 2017 30 % ± 5 % ( 25 % , 35 % ) 10 % 323 30 % ± 10 % ( 20 % , 40 % ) 20 % 81 Page 3 of 8 Naing et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2022 ) 22 : 209 studies or large scale studies , aiming to gain attention from policy makers , should aim for a precision of 2 to 3 % , whereas small scale ( or poorly - funded studies ) , for example , undergraduate or master student research pro - jects , may consider a precision of 4 to 5 % . If the precision is larger than 5 % ( such as 10 % ) , due to limited resources , researchers should consider the study as a preliminary study . However , the above recommendation applies to the expected prevalence of 10 to 90 % . When the expected prevalence is too small ( less than 10 % ) or too large ( more than 90 % ) , we need to apply much smaller precision . It is obvious that a precision of 5 % is possible for an expected prevalence of 50 % , but 5 % precision is totally inappropri - ate for an expected prevalence of 2 % . We present details of precision for expected prevalence with examples in Table 2 . Parameter 3 : variability of the data The larger the vari - ation the data has , the larger is the sample size needed . This relationship can be explained in a simple analogy . When we cook soup and near to the finish , we stir it well before we taste . We always need a very small amount ( small sample size ) to taste because we stir it well and the variation is almost zero . Practically , in estimating prevalence , the prevalence has effect on this variation and therefore effect on the required sample size . The relationship of prevalence and the sample size is presented in Fig . 1 . Obviously , it is the research objective to estimate the prevalence and researchers do not know this prevalence . Therefore , to calculate sample size , we normally find it out from most recent published studies with similar study population . If we cannot find suitable studies in the literature , we may consider to conduct a pilot study . When we find multiple suitable prevalence from the lit - erature , for example ranging from 15 to 30 % , we should use the prevalence giving the highest sample size ( in this case , 30 % ) in accordance with Fig . 1 that shows 30 % will require the largest sample size in that range of 15 to 30 % prevalence . Similarly , if the prevalence ranges from 60 to 80 % in the recent literature , we should use 60 % as it requires the largest sample size in that range . We would like to caution that some books or guidelines suggest to use expected prevalence 50 % if we could not get the prevalence at all [ 2 , 14 , 15 ] . We discourage this practice . In Fig . 1 , we should note that the prevalence of 50 % will produce the largest sample size only within the range of 10 and 90 % of the prevalence . The required sam - ple size is much higher in the region below 10 and above 90 % . Therefore , a short cut of prevalence 50 % should not be used . It is best to calculate the sample size with appro - priate expected prevalence . Researchers may find possi - ble range of expected prevalence and apply the recom - mendation in the previous paragraph . For this illustration , we have drawn Fig . 1 using preci - sion for small scale study ( Table 2 ) . It means that we use Table 2 Recommended precision for expected prevalence EP Expected Prevalence in percent EP Recommended Precision Large Scale Small Scale Preliminary Study Remark 1 10 to 90 % 2 ~ 3 % 4 ~ 5 % > 5 % 2 < 10 % 0 . 25 * EP 0 . 50 * EP > 0 . 50 * EP Cannot be equal to EP or larger e . g . 4 % 1 % 2 % > 2 % Cannot be 4 % or larger 3 > 90 % 0 . 25 * ( 100 - EP ) 0 . 5 * ( 100 - EP ) > 0 . 5 * ( 100 - EP ) Cannot be ( 100 - EP ) or larger e . g . 95 % 1 . 25 % 2 . 5 % > 2 . 5 % Cannot be 5 % or larger Fig . 1 Prevalence and Effect on Sample Size Page 4 of 8 Naing et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2022 ) 22 : 209 the precision of fixed 5 % for the expected prevalence between 10 and 90 % , half of the expected prevalence for the expected prevalence less than 10 % , and half of the ( 100 minus expected prevalence ) for the expected preva - lence larger than 90 % . Parameter 4 : anticipated loss We always have loss in sample size during the research process due to several reasons , such as non - response , incomplete data , loss - to - follow up , etc . Researchers should estimate the loss with their past experience , and inflate the sample size in calcu - lation accordingly . These losses ( especially , non - response , incomplete data , and loss - to - follow up ) are very much related to research areas ( for example , non - response rate could be higher if we study sexual issues or other sensi - tive issues ) and population that researchers intend to study . Therefore , we recommend researchers to use non - response rates of previous studies of similar research areas and in similar populations . Although we can put any per cent of the potential loss and inflate the sample size , it doesn’t guarantee that the calculated sample size is valid in terms of representative sample . In general , we would recommend that less than 10 % loss would be an acceptable loss . However , there are different opinions on the acceptable per cent of loss or attrition [ 16 ] depending on the type of studies . At least , it is important to note that the higher the loss or attrition , the larger will be the compromise on the validity of the results . Sample size calculation report The report of sample size should be reproducible . It means that all parameters used must be reported . There are four parameters namely , level of confidence ( mostly 95 % ) , expected prevalence ( mostly from literature or pilot study ) , the precision or margin of error of estimate ( decision by researchers ) and anticipated loss ( experi - ence of researchers ) used in the calculation . We should also include the name of the software or calculator with proper reference . Scalex SP calculator has incor - porated the draft report for the user to copy and use . It ensures all necessary parameters used are included in the report . Results and discussion Demonstration of Scalex SP and ScalaR calculator Simple three steps for Scalex SP Basically , the Scalex SP calculator ( Scalex stands for ‘Sample Size Calculator using Excel’ , and SP stands for ‘Single Proportion’ ) ( available at : https : / / sites . google . com / view / sr - ln / ssc ) guides the users in three steps : Fig . 2 Scalex SP interface for Step 1 , 2 and 3 Page 5 of 8 Naing et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2022 ) 22 : 209 Step 1 : to type in “Expected Prevalence” in terms of per cent ( > 0 to < 100 ) . Step 2 : to type in “Anticipated Loss” in terms of per cent ( 0 to < 100 ) . Step 3 : to decide and type in the precision of user choice after going through the Sample Size Table . Users may type a precision which is not listed in the table ( such as ± 2 . 5 % ) . Then , Scalex SP will give a draft report for the user . Major advantage of the Scalex SP calculator is that , it gives users Sample Size Table ( Fig . 3 ) in which users can appreciate sample sizes for a range of precision , and appreciate or foresee the CIs in their results . Therefore , it helps users in decision making of selecting precision con - sidering available resources . Example using Scalex SP We are going to conduct a study to estimate the preva - lence of obesity among secondary school children in a district . We managed to find the expected prevalence in the literature as 30 % . When we start the Scalex SP , we see the interface as in Fig . 2 . Then , we fill 30 ( 30 % ) for Expected Prevalence . As we experienced 10 % non - response in this study popula - tion in previous studies , we fill 10 % loss ( see Fig . 3 ) . Then , sample sizes given for various precisions are reviewed and we decide to use ± 3 % precision as it gives us an acceptable width of 95 % CI ( 27 % , 33 % ) , and the sample size ( n = 997 ) is possible to manage . Then , we fill in 3 ( 3 % ) in Step 3 , and Scalex SP gives the draft report as in Fig . 3 . ScalaR SP programme for R users Authors have written R Script ( ScalaR SP . R ) and with two command lines as in Fig . 4 ( this Script file must be stored at “Working Directory” ) , will give the same output as Scalex SP . ( available at : https : / / sites . google . com / view / sr - ln / ssc ) . Example of R command as follows : > ScalarSP ( p = 0 . 3 , d = 0 . 03 , loss = 0 . 1 ) . p = expected prevalence . d = precision or margin of error . loss = anticipated loss or attrition of sample size . Other issues The Scalex calculator is for studies using the specific sampling method such as simple random sampling , sys - tematic sampling , and proportionate - stratified random sampling . For other sampling methods , the calculated Fig . 3 Scalex SP with Report Page 6 of 8 Naing et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2022 ) 22 : 209 sample size should be multiplied with the design effect [ 14 ] . Estimating design effect could be from the literature if it is reported in the previous similar studies . If not , it is a complicated procedure involving data simulation . Limitation of the presented calculators The formula used in these calculators ( reported in Para 2 above ) assumes that the population is unknown and large . If the population is known , the required sample size could be smaller by using a different formula which has population size in the formula . However , if we use the formula with population size and obtain smaller sam - ple size , researchers should analyse the data using ‘finite population correction’ and ‘survey data analysis method’ [ 17 ] instead of standard statistical analyses , to obtain valid results . Therefore , we consider a safer approach , that is , assuming that the population size is unknown both in calculating sample size and also later in data analyses . Therefore , it could be a limitation , if one would like to calculate a sample size with known population size and also using ‘finite population correction’ in their data analyses . The presented calculators have been designed using Wald’s confidence interval . The limitation of this confi - dence interval is that , it could go below 0 % or above 100 % in the confidence intervals if the users specify precision Fig . 4 ScalaR SP—with report Page 7 of 8 Naing et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2022 ) 22 : 209 inappropriately in relation to the expected prevalence . Though we could give users a choice to consider other methods of confidence interval such as exact confidence interval , logit - confidence interval , etc . we prevent this issue by recommending the use of appropriate precision in Implementation Paragraph 2 . 1 . 2 and Table 2 . We con - sider this would be a more intuitive approach especially for users with limited statistical knowledge or skills . In any case , with a single method of confidence interval ( Wald ) , we wish to report this limitation for the pre - sented calculators . Conclusions With technological advancement , researchers should not calculate sample sizes manually . The software or calcula - tors should help researchers minimize possible error in calculation and also to assist in reporting . However , the use of correct parameters still remains as the responsibil - ity of users . In addition , calculators using free software , will benefit researchers who have limited resources . The presented calculators , designed for prevalence studies , is available at : ( https : / / sites . google . com / view / sr - ln / ssc ) for public without asking permission . Authors will continue to use Scalex calculator for other type of studies in the near future . The presented calculators are beneficial as the calcula - tors incorporate non - response or other loss , indicate the anticipated 95 % CI , give a list of sample sizes for a range of precisions therefore , guide to make informed decision for precision , and finally draft a sample size calculation report for scientific reporting . This paper also includes a number of cautions and recommendations for selecting parameters , especially expected prevalence , precision , and anticipated loss , so that researchers can conduct prevalence studies with more appropriate sample sizes .
