Here , we study the structure and interactions of actin with the FH2 domain of budding yeast formin Bni1p . We built an all - atom model of the formin dimer on an Oda actin ﬁlament 7 - mer and studied structural relaxation and interprotein interactions by molecular dynamics simulations . These simulations produced a reﬁned model for the FH2 dimer associated with the barbed end of the ﬁlament and showed electro - static interactions between the formin knob and actin target - binding cleft . Mutations of two formin re - sidues contributing to these interactions ( R1423N , K1467L , or both ) reduced the interaction energies between the proteins , and in coarse - grained simula - tions , the formin lost more interprotein contacts with an actin dimer than with an actin 7 - mer . Biochemical experiments conﬁrmed a strong inﬂuence of these mutations on Bni1p - mediated actin ﬁlament nucle - ation , but not elongation , suggesting that different interactions contribute to these two functions of formins . INTRODUCTION Formins are large ( 120 – 220 kDa ) multidomain proteins that mediate the nucleation and growth of actin ﬁlaments . They are widely expressed in eukaryotes , helping to regulate the architec - ture of the actin cytoskeleton and thus play an important role in cellular processes such as morphogenesis , cytokinesis , and adhesion ( Goode and Eck , 2007 ) . The dimeric formin homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain stabilizes ﬁlament nuclei consisting of two or three actin subunits and remains processively associated with the elongating ﬁlament barbed end by reliably dissociating from the second - to - last actin subunit and transferring onto a newly incorporated subunit ( Higashida et al . , 2004 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Mizuno et al . , 2011 ) . FH2 - bound ﬁlament barbed ends typically elongate more slowly than free barbed ends , a phenomenon known as ‘‘gating , ’’ which has been proposed to arise from conformational ﬂuctuations be - tween a polymerization - competent ‘‘open’’ state and a polymer - ization - incompetent ‘‘closed’’ state ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . Polyproline motifs in the adjacent ﬂexible FH1 domain bind proﬁlin - actin complexes ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Watanabe et al . , 1997 ) and increase the rate of polymerization by rapid , diffusion - mediated delivery of actin to the FH2 - bound barbed end ( Kovar et al . , 2003 , 2006 ; Ro - mero et al . , 2004 ) . The FH1 and FH2 domains are ﬂanked by reg - ulatory domains , which control their activity by interactions with signaling factors such as Rho GTPases ( Watanabe et al . , 1997 ) . Here , we focus on interactions of the formin FH2 domain with actin . A crystal structure of the FH2 domain of the S . cerevisiae for - min Bni1p ( Xu et al . , 2004 ) revealed a ring - like structure with the two FH2 domains arranged head to tail ( Figure 1 ) . In this arrange - ment , the ‘‘lasso’’ region at the FH2 N terminus binds the ‘‘post’’ site at the C terminus of the other subunit ( for deﬁnitions of fea - tures , see Table S1 available online ) . A largely unstructured linker peptide connects the lasso region to the main FH2 structure ( Xu et al . , 2004 ) . A cocrystal of Bni1p FH2 with actin ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) provided important insights into the interaction of the FH2 domain with the actin ﬁlament , although the actin molecules in the cocrystal were arranged with 2 - fold rotational symmetry of 180 (cid:1) rather than the 167 (cid:1) twist in actin ﬁlaments ( Oda et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , the linker peptide connected the FH2 do - mains in the cocrystal in a continuous chain around the 2 - fold array of actins , rather than forming head - to - tail dimers . Manual rearrangement of the linker peptide created a model of a head - to - tail FH2 dimer around a 180 (cid:1) twist actin ﬁlament ( Figure 1 ) ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . In this model the knob and post regions of the FH2 dimer contact three actins with one FH2 ( the leading FH2 ) closer to the barbed end of the ‘‘ﬁlament’’ than the other 68 Structure 23 , 68 – 79 , January 6 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved trailing FH2 . FH2 ‘‘knobs’’ made strong contacts with the groove at the barbed end of actin , a region called the target - binding cleft ( TBC ) owing to interactions with a host of proteins ( Dominguez , 2004 , 2007 ; Dominguez and Holmes , 2011 ) . These structural insights led to proposals for the mechanisms of gating and processive elongation . Gating was proposed to arise from a rapid equilibrium of the subunits at the barbed end between an open state with a 167 (cid:1) twist favorable for elongation and a closed state with an unfavorable twist structure such as Figure 1 . Comparison of the Initial Model and the Reﬁned Model from All - Atom MD SimulationofaDimerofBni1pFH2DomainsAssociatedwiththeBarbedEndofanActinFilament The initial model was constructed by aligning the FH2 and actins from the Otomo crystal structure ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) on the end of the Oda actin ﬁlament structure ( Oda et al . , 2009 ) . This structure relaxed during 160 ns of all - atom MD simulation . Snapshots are from the 160 ns WT simulation .

On the left , an incoming actin subunit is shown approaching the ‘‘open’’ conformation of the actin ﬁlament . On the right , the newly added subunit is incorporated onto the barbed end of the ﬁlament , ready for the trailing FH2 domain to take a step along the ﬁlament . We simulated the state on the right in ( A ) , prior to the step of the trailing FH2 domain .

See also Figures S1 – S3 and Tables S1 – S3 . the 180 (cid:1) conformation in the cocrystal ( Paul and Pollard , 2009 ) . To explain proc - essive elongation , the trailing FH2 domain was proposed to dissociate from the ﬁlament and translocate toward the barbed end either before ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ; Zigmond et al . , 2003 ) or after the new actin subunit is added to the barbed end ( Paul and Pollard , 2009 ) . However , the structure of the FH2 dimer bound to the end of a ﬁlament with a 167 (cid:1) twist angle was not known . We used molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations to investigate the interactions of the Bni1p FH2 dimer with the actin ﬁla - ment . We started with a model of the 167 (cid:1) twist actin ﬁlament with a Bni1p FH2 dimer bound at the barbed end based on the actin ﬁlament structure solved by X - ray ﬁber diffraction ( Oda et al . , 2009 ) and intermolecular contacts observed in the Bni1p FH2 / actin cocrystal ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . Our atomistic MD simulations reﬁned the structure by bringing the FH2 dimer into much more intimate contact with the four actin subunits at the barbed end of a ﬁlament . The new model revealed electro - static interactions between the FH2 domains and actin , espe - cially interactions of residues R1423 and K1467 of Bni1p with the TBC and DNase - I - binding D - loop of actin . Substitution of these residues in simulations changed the electrostatic interac - tion energy between the FH2 knobs and the actin TBC .

Experimental observations showed that sub - stitutions for R1423 and K1467 compromise nucleation by Bni1p FH2 domains but have no effect on the elongation rate or the processive association with the growing barbed end of the actin ﬁlament . Taken together , our results suggest that electrostatic interactions between the ﬁlament barbed end and residues R1423 and K1467 of the FH2 domain inﬂuence the nucleation ac - tivity of Bni1p and that nucleation and elongation depend on different sets of intermolecular interactions . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structural Changes in the Bni1p / Actin System Our simulated all - atom system consisted of the Bni1p FH2 dimer bound to actin subunits A2 and A3 of an actin 7 - mer , with an additional subunit ( A1 ) at the barbed end of the ﬁlament to repre - sent the ‘‘newly added’’ actin subunit before the step of the trail - ing FH2 domain ( Figure 1A ) . We assessed the overall stability of the system using the root mean - squared deviation ( RMSD ) of the alpha - carbon atoms of the complex ( Figure S1A ) . Starting from a snapshot at the end of the wild - type ( WT ) simulation , we continued ﬁve simulations , two with WT formin ( WTa and WTb ) for 40 ns each and three with amino acid substitutions for 50 ns each . Their RMSDs are stable like the initial WT structure over that time ( Figure S1A ) . The initial structure of the WT Bni1p / actin system relaxes dur - ing the simulation , resulting in conformational rearrangements thatbringboththeleading ( FH2L ) andtrailing ( FH2T ) FH2domains closer to the ﬁlament axis , allowing their knob and post / lasso re - gions to contact the actin ﬁlament simultaneously ( Figures 1 , S2 , andS3 ) . ThelinkersofbothFH2LandFH2Tshortenprogressively ( Figure S1B ) as the FH2 domains move into closer contact with actin ( compare Figures 1B and 1C , and compare Figures 1D and 1E ) . As a result , the buried surface area increases at all inter - faces between the FH2 domains and actin subunits A1 to A3 over the course of the simulation ( Table S2 ) . The majority of these in - creases are (cid:3) 250A˚ 2 or greater , withthelargestchange occurring at the FH2L - A2 protein interface and the smallest change occur - ring at the FH2L - A3 interface . Tables S2 and S3 provide more detail regarding the surfaces involved with these changes in solvent - accessible surface area ( SASA ) during the simulations . While the formin FH2 domains move in toward the ﬁlament axis , their orientation with respect to one another around the ﬁla - mentaxisdoesnotchangedramatically , asthe a - helicaldomains between the knob and lasso of each FH2 domain remain roughly parallel to one another ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . However , as FH2T moves in toward the ﬁlament , the C - terminal helix of its post domain makes some contacts with actin A4 , which are not pre - sent in the Otomo crystal structure , where the FH2 domains make contacts with only three actin subunits ( Figures S4C and S4D ) . The interactions of the FH2T lasso with actin monomer A1 in our reﬁned model of the head - to - tail FH2 dimer are missing in the Otomo structure , owing to the arrangement of the FH2 do - mains in a continuous chain in the crystal ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . Our simulations support a key assumption of virtually all models for processive stepping of FH2 domains during ﬁlament elongation , namely , that the linkers between the helical domains of FH2 are ﬂexible as ﬁrst suggested by comparing crystal struc - tures ( Xu et al . , 2004 ) . The linker connecting the lasso to the FH2 knob ( Figure 1 ) is very ﬂexible in our simulations : the FH2L linker changed position , with an RMSD of (cid:3) 8 . 8 A˚ during the simulation , while the RMSD of the FH2T linker passed through a maximum of (cid:3) 7 . 1 A˚ before ending at (cid:3) 4 . 1 A˚ ( Figure S1B ) . The distance be - tween the alpha - carbon atoms of residues A1393 and Q1416 ( the last residue in the lasso and ﬁrst residue in the knob at either end of the linker ) decreased from (cid:3) 41 A ˚ to (cid:3) 38 A ˚ in FH2T and from (cid:3) 65 A ˚ to (cid:3) 44 A ˚ in FH2L ( Figure S1B ) . On the other hand , both the FH2L and FH2T linkers form extensive interactions with the actin ﬁlament by the end of the WT simulations . The FH2L linker buries 620 A ˚ 2 of SASA and forms the following four salt bridges with actin A2 : actin residue E2 with Bni1p residue K1417 ( 31 . 1 % ) ; D3 with K1412 ( 62 . 0 % ) ; E99 with R1402 ( 87 . 5 % ) ; and K359 with E1403 ( 69 . 9 % ) .

The FH2T linker buries 440 A˚ 2 of SASA and forms a salt bridge between actin A1 D363 and FH2T R1402 ( 78 . 6 % ) . There - fore , Bni1p must break a number of contacts between the linker and actin for the post and knob domains to detach from actin A3 and step onto the new subunits A1 at the end of the ﬁlament . We used simulations to test if FH2 domains inﬂuence the twist angle between actin subunits at the barbed end of the ﬁlament , as proposed to explain gating ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . In a con - trol simulation of an Oda actin ﬁlament 30 - mer without formin , the distribution of twist angles between subunits A1 and A2 does not change between the ﬁrst and last 20 ns of the 160 ns simulation ( Figures S1E and S1F ) . For the actin 7 - mer with for - min , the twist angles do not drift signiﬁcantly from 167 (cid:1) during the ﬁrst 20 ns of simulation ( Figure S1C ) , but by the end of the 160 ns WT simulations , the distributions of twist angles become more heterogeneous and shift toward larger values ( although , it should be noted , we did not see a full transition to a 180 (cid:1) ‘‘closed’’ state ) . For example , the twist between A1 and A2 be - comes (cid:3) 172 (cid:1) , indicating a ﬂatter ﬁlament ( Figure S1D ) . Thus , the simulations may sample the inﬂuence of the formin on the rapid equilibrium between the standard twist , which is favorable for subunit addition in the ‘‘open state , ’’ and a ﬂatter closed conformation that would be less favorable for adding a subunit ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . When Bni1p is bound to the end of a ﬁla - ment , the open and closed states are equally populated ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . Salt Bridges and Hydrogen Bonds between the FH2 Knob Helices and the Actin TBC To form a more quantitative picture of the contacts between the FH2 domains and the actin ﬁlament in our MD simulations , we measured distances between alpha - carbons of the FH2 do - mains and actin subunits A1 to A4 for ten trajectory frames over Figure 3 . Salt Bridges and H - Bonds of Bni1p R1423 and K1467 with Actin Ribbon diagrams of actin ﬁlament subunits A1 – A3 are shown in gray , orange , and yellow , respec - tively , along with formin helices KnA ( residues 1422 – 1440 , cyan and pink in FH2L and FH2T , respectively ) and KnB ( residues 1457 – 1479 , blue and red in FH2L and FH2T , respectively ) The backbone of the actin TBC is shown in purple ( deﬁned as residues 22 – 26 , 139 – 149 , 167 – 169 , 338 – 355 ) . The insets show close - up views of the FH2T interactions with A3 ( upper right ) and the FH2L interactions with A2 ( lower right ) . Salt bridges / H - bonds are highlighted with light blue transparent ovals . The residues that constitute the TBC , KnA , and KnB were used to calculate the electrostatic interaction energies in Tables 2 and S2 . See also Table S5 . the last 20 ns of the WT simulation . We deﬁned a contact as a pair of alpha - car - bons separated by < 12 A˚ . For each Bni1p residue , we then integrated over all actin contacts to determine the time - averaged total number of contacts of each Bni1p residue with actin ( Figure 2 ) . FH2L pri - marily contacts actin subunit A2 , although its post domain also contacts subunits A1 and A3 . On the other hand , FH2T mainly contacts subunits A1 and A3 , but its post domain also contacts subunits A2 and A4 . The KnA and KnB helices in the knob domain contact the actin TBC and D - loop ( Figure 3 ; Figures S4A and S4B ) . The KnA and KnB helices of FH2L contact subunit A2 , and these helices in FH2T contact both subunits A1 and A3 . These contacts are stronger in our equilibrated Bni1p / Oda sys - tem ( Figure 2 ) than the starting Otomo structure ( Figures S4C and S4D ) , especially FH2T KnA / KnB ( Table S1 ) . Additionally , our equilibrated structure has a small number of contacts be - tween actin and the Bni1p coiled - coil domain ( around residue number 1550 ) that are absent from the starting model . The large number of contacts with actin and their proximity to the actin TBC and D - loop focused our attention on the FH2 knob helices , KnA and KnB . As actin is highly charged , we looked for salt bridges and H - bonds between actin and charged residues in the FH2 knob helices KnA ( R1423 , D1424 ) and KnB ( E1463 , K1467 , E1469 , E1472 , and R1479 ) ( Table 1 ) . In the WT simulations , K1467 and E1463 establish stable salt bridges and H - bonds with residues in the actin TBC . These inter - actions occur between FH2L and actin subunit A2 and between FH2T and subunit A3 . Residues D1424 , E1469 , E1472 , and R1479 of FH2L form additional H - bonds and salt bridges to actin subunit A1 . These interactions can only occur between FH2T and A1 because of its position at the barbed end of the ﬁlament ; therefore , they are unique to the prestepped state . Bni1p residues E1469 and D1424 interact primarily with residues K50 and K61 in subdomain2 ( SD2 ) ofactin , whichcontainstheD - loop . AnH - bond is present between R1423 in KnA and Q354 in the actin TBC , occurring both between FH2L and A2 and between FH2T and A3 . We tested the importance of these salt bridges in interactions between Bni1p and actin by making point substitutions of one Structure Formin - Actin Interactions Affect Actin Nucleation Structure 23 , 68 – 79 , January 6 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 71 electrostatically interacting residue in each knob helix . We used simulations to choose R1423 in KnA , a residue that forms an H - bond with actin Q354 in both FH2L and FH2T . The region of actin with Q354 interacts with other actin - binding proteins , including vinculin ( Golji and Mofrad , 2013 ) , proﬁlin ( Ezezika et al . , 2009 ; Schutt et al . , 1993 ) , myosin ( Patel and Root , 2009 ) , and coﬁlin ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . We chose K1467 in KnB because of its strong interactions in both FH2L and FH2T with actin residue E167 , especially between FH2T and A3 . E167 is implicated in interactions with the D - loop of adjacent actin sub - units in actin ﬁlaments ( Fujii et al . , 2010 ; Oda et al . , 2009 ) and with speciﬁc ions in the D - loop region ( Kang et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) . Both the R1423 / Q354 H - bond and the K1467 / E167 salt bridge can form simultaneously ( Figure 3 ) . Point Mutations Decrease the Electrostatic Interaction Energy between the FH2 Knob Helices and Actin We made point substitutions at positions 1423 and 1467 in Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p , a construct with the FH1 polyproline track located closest to the FH2 domain , followed by the FH2 domain . This construct is stable and easily puriﬁed , and its actin polymer - ization properties are well characterized ( Courtemanche and Pollard , 2012 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . Substituting alanine for R1432 or K1467 produced insoluble proteins , but constructs with asparagine substituting for R1423 or leucine substituting for K1467 , or both substitutions , expressed well and could be puriﬁed both individually and in combination . The WT and all three mutant constructs had indistinguishable elution proﬁles during size exclusion chromatography ( Figure S5A ) , and the pu - riﬁed proteins migrated as single bands corresponding to the same molecular weight by SDS - PAGE ( Figure S5B ) . Fluores - cence emission spectra of the WT and mutant constructs con - tained single peaks that coincided at 325 nm , suggesting that the tryptophan residues reside in similar hydrophobic environ - ments and have similar overall tertiary structures ( Figure S5C ) . Based on the WT structure at 160 ns of simulation , we con - structed all - atom MD models of two single - amino - acid mutants : ( 1 ) R1423N , which perturbs KnA ; and ( 2 ) K1467L , which perturbs KnB . We also tested the double - mutant R1423N / K1467L , which compromises interactions of both KnA and KnB with actin . Table 1 .

Structure Formin - Actin Interactions Affect Actin Nucleation 72 Structure 23 , 68 – 79 , January 6 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Simulations lasting 50 ns show that some salt bridges and H - bonds are maintained in the mutant formins but that others are disrupted ( Table 1 ) . The following pairwise interactions ( formin - actin ) are relatively stable in all three mutant formins : D1424 - K50 and R1479 - E100 are stable in FH2T and E1463 - R147 is stable in both FH2 domains . On the other hand , the K1467L and R1423N / K1467L substitutions completely disrupt the 1467 / 167 salt bridge . The interaction of K1467 in FH2L with E167 in A2 is also lost in the R1423N mutant , as K1467 in - teracts instead with E1469 within the same FH2L domain 52 . 2 % of the time . H - bonding between R1423 in Bni1p and Q354 in actin is reduced to various degrees compared to the WT in simulations of all three mutant formins . For the knob res - idues that interact with actin residues outside the TBC , E1469 ( nearby to K1467 ) forms a salt bridge and H - bond with K61 in SD2 of actin , and both the K1467L and R1423N / K1467L mutations reduce these interactions . The interactions between D1424 of FH2T and K50 in the D - loop of actin subunit A1 may contribute to D - loop insertion during the addition of a subunit at the barbed end . Calculations of the total interaction energy ( i . e . , sum of the nonbonded terms in the MD force ﬁeld ) showed that the charge mutations made interactions of KnA and KnB with the actin TBCs less favorable ( less negative ) for FH2L - A2 and even more so for FH2T - A3 ( Table 2 ; with individual contributions of KnA and KnB in Table S4 ) . The loss of interaction energy is larger for the double mutant ( Table 2 ) . The interaction energies of actin with KnB of both FH2L and FH2T are larger than those with KnA , and the double mutant reduces the KnB / actin interactions more than the KnA / actin interactions ( Table S4 ) . Simulations of CG Models of Mutant Formins and Actin To test the effect of the point mutations on the interactions be - tween Bni1p and actin on time scales beyond the reach of all - atom simulations , we built CG models of both WT and mutant Bni1p FH2 dimers bound to either subunits A2 and A3 of an actin 7 - mer ( Figure 4C ) or to an actin dimer ( Figure 4B ) . The spectrum of contacts between Bni1p and actin is very similar in CG simu - lations of the WT ( Figures 5A and 5B ) and mutant ( Figures 5C and 5D ) formins with the actin 7 - mer , although the magnitudes of these contacts are larger in the CG simulations ( Figure 5 ) than in the all - atom simulations ( Figure 2 ) . The larger number of con - tacts observed in some regions of the CG simulations ( for example , the additional allowed contacts between the a - helical domain and actin in the CG system ) likely results from the absence of explicit solvent in the CG model . CG simulations of the FH2 dimer with an actin dimer gave larger differences in contacts between the WT ( Figures 6A and 6B ) and mutant ( Figures 6C and 6D ) formins than in the 7 - mer Table 2 .

For example , in simulations of FH2L with actin dimers , both the KnB and coiled - coil domains have fewer contacts with actin in the mutant formin than in the WT formin , and for FH2T , both the helical domain and the KnB helix have fewer contacts with actin A3 in the mutant formin than in the WT formin . The greater loss of contacts between KnB of FH2T and A3 in the actin dimer simulation is consistent with the all - atom simulation where for - min mutations reduce the total interaction energy more for the FH2T - KnB interaction with actin ( Tables 2 and S4 ) . Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p with Substitutions for K1423 or R1467 Elongate Actin Filaments Normally For comparison with the all - atom and CG analyses , we investi - gated the effects of the R1423N and K1467L substitutions in Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p on actin polymerization in vitro . We measured the elongation rates of ﬁlament barbed ends in the presence of WT or mutant formins by time - lapse total internal reﬂection ﬂuo - rescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Figure 7A ) . Barbed ends asso - ciated with WT Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p elongated at 8 . 4 subunits per second in the presence of 1 . 5 m M actin ( 33 % labeled with Ore - gon Green on cysteine 374 ) , compared to 13 . 0 subunits per second for free barbed ends ( Figure 7B ) . This corresponds to a gating factor ( deﬁned as the ratio of polymerization rates with and without formin ) of 0 . 6 , consistent with previous reports ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . Inclusion of 5 m M proﬁlin in the reaction increased elonga - tion mediated by Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p to 12 . 1 subunits per second , reﬂecting the delivery of proﬁlin - actin from the FH1 domain , which contains a single polyproline track , to the barbed end ( Figure 7B ) . Point substitutions at positions 1423 and 1467 , both individu - ally and in combination , do not affect actin elongation rates mediated by Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p in either the absence or the pres - ence of 5 m M proﬁlin ( Figure 7B ) . As seen for WT Bni1p con - structs ( Courtemanche and Pollard , 2012 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) , the ﬂuorescence intensity of for - min - bound ﬁlaments polymerized in the presence of proﬁlin is lower than that of ﬁlaments with free barbed ends , owing to the lower afﬁnity of proﬁlin for ﬂuorescently labeled actin mono - mers ( Vinson et al . , 1998 ) , conﬁrming that the FH1 domain is capable of mediating polymerization ( Figure S6A ) . Thus , these substitutions do not affect FH2 domain gating or efﬁcient deliv - ery of proﬁlin - actin to the barbed end via the FH1 domain . To determine whether the point substitutions affect the ability of Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p to remain processively bound to ﬁlament Figure 5 .

Filament elongation rates mediated by WT and mutant Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p are constant over a time span of up to 300 s , showing that each formin remains bound to barbed ends for at least 2 , 400 cycles of subunit addition . Therefore , substitution of residues R1423 and K1467 does not affect the processive properties of Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p . Substitutions for Residues 1423 and 1467 Impair Actin Filament Nucleation by Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p To estimate the effects of substitution of R1423 and K1467 on the ability of Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p to nucleate actin ﬁlaments , we Figure 6 .

Whereas 10 nM of WT Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p nucleated numerous ﬁlaments , much higher concentrations of the mutant formins are required to nucleate comparable numbers of ﬁlaments ( Figure 7A ) . By visually comparing the numbers of ﬁlaments present at the start of data collection and after 300 and 600 s , we estimate that the R1423N substitution decreases nucleation by at least 10 - fold , whereas the K1467L substitution appears to be more severe and decreases nucleation by at least 30 - fold . Substitution of both residues causes the most dramatic effect and decreases apparent nucleation by at least 100 - fold . To rule out actin mono - mer sequestration as the cause of the differences in the numbers of ﬁlaments produced , we measured the rate of elongation of ﬁl - aments with free barbed ends in the presence of a varying range of formin mutant concentrations ( Figure S6B ) . This rate is con - stant in the presence of formin concentrations up to 1 m M , conﬁrming that the low numbers of ﬁlaments arise from weak nucleation by the formin mutants , not from sequestration of actin monomers . We quantiﬁed the extent of the nucleation defects caused by these substitutions by monitoring the time course of assembly of 4 m M actin ( 20 % pyrene labeled ) in the presence of a range of concentrations of each construct of Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p ( Fig - ure 8A ) . In these assays , nucleation is the main determinant of the overall polymerization rate . Knowing the bulk polymerization rates and the elongation rates from TIRF observations ( Fig - ure 8B ) , one can calculate the number of ﬁlaments at each time point . Consistent with our microscopy experiments , bulk assembly assays show a dramatic reduction in actin assembly rates medi - ated by the mutant formins , with K1467L having a lower nucle - ation activity than R1423N and the double substitution having little activity . The concentrations of formin required to produce a half - maximal concentration of barbed ends are much larger for the variants than for WT . Thus , although substitutions for R1423 and K1467 do not affect the ability of Bni1p to stay bound to elongating ﬁlament barbed ends , these residues do contribute signiﬁcantly to the interactions of Bni1p required to form actin ﬁlament nuclei . Although we did not simulate Bni1p - mediated nucleation or polymerization directly , these results appear to be consistent with the results of the CG formin simulations where WT and dou - ble - mutant CG models of Bni1p bound to an actin 7 - mer simi - larly , while the double - mutant Bni1p had fewer contacts with the actin dimer than the CG model of WT Bni1p . Thus , R1423 and K1467 are more important for electrostatic interactions with actin dimers than ﬁlaments , explaining the low nucleation activity of Bni1p with positive to neutral mutations of Bni1p knob helices . These combined computational and experimental results provide evidence that nucleation and elongation are separable functions of formins and also suggest that formin FH2 domains interact differently with ﬁlament nuclei than with ﬁlament barbed ends . Although R1423 and K1467 are not highly conserved residues among formins , many formins contain positively charged resi - dues at positions corresponding to residues 1424 , 1466 , and 1468 in Bni1p ( see Table S5 for representative formin se - quences ) . As R1423 and K1467 are both located in ﬂexible Figure 7 .

Our simulations demonstrate a similar situation where a salt bridge forms between D1424 in Bni1p and K50 in actin in the R1423N mutant ( Table 1 ) . Although further structural studies will be required to conﬁrm the existence and mechanistic importance of salt bridges between the FH2 do - mains and actin , the presence of charged residues in the knob loops of many formins suggests that electrostatic interactions contribute to the stable association between FH2 domains and small ﬁlament nuclei and , thus , may confer nucleation activity to formins in general . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Modeling and All - Atom Simulation of the Formin / Actin System We conducted atomistic MD simulations of a Bni1p FH2 dimer bound at the barbedendofanactinﬁlament .

( 2009 ) . Wecreatedtheinitialstructureusing a series of structural alignments and remodeling steps detailed in the Supple - mentalExperimentalProcedures . Asindicatedbystructuraldata ( Otomoetal . , 2005 ) , it is not possible to align the FH2 domain against a 167 (cid:1) actin ﬁlament while maintaining contacts at both the knob and lasso / post regions . Brieﬂy , our approach was to conduct the alignment so as to preserve the binding mode oftheknob , whichconstitutes themost extensive setof interactionsbe - tween actin and formin . The conﬁguration of the system represented the puta - tive stage in the stepping process subsequent to actin addition but prior to translocation of the trailing FH2 ( the ‘‘prestep’’ state , depicted schematically in Figure 1A ) . We refer to the leading and trailing FH2 domains as FH2L and FH2T and to the actin subunits in the 7 - mer as A1 through A7 , with A1 repre - senting the terminal subunit at the barbed end and A7 representing the pointed - end actin subunit . We mainly discuss subunits A1 through A4 , which are the only ﬁlament subunits directly accessible to Bni1p . Simulations of the Bni1p / actin system were run with NAMD ( Phillips et al . , 2005 ) using the Charmm27 force ﬁeld with CMAP corrections ( Mackerell etal . , 2004 ) . The167 (cid:1) twistOda7 - merwasbuiltasdescribedfora13 - merﬁla - ment ( Chu and Voth , 2005 ; Pfaendtner et al . , 2010 ; Saunders and Voth , 2011 ) , except only seven subunits were used and the ﬁlament was not built to be continuous across the boundary of the periodic simulation cell . The subunit structure used in the construction of the Oda 7 - mer is based on the Protein Data Bank entry 2ZWH ( Oda et al . , 2009 ) and included both ADP and the Mg 2 + ion in the actin nucleotide cleft , in addition to waters that complete the coordination to the ion ( Saunders and Voth , 2011 ) . Additional details of the simulation protocol are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . We carried out two additional WT simulations for 40 ns each ( WTa and WTb ) , each started from a different snapshot near the end of the long WT simulation in order to increase sampling of the various electrostatic interac - tions in the simulation and to further gauge stability of the Bni1p / actin structure ( Figure 1A ) . We also carried out simulations of several Bni1p / actin mutant systems for 50 ns each ( details of setup for mutant systems can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . These were R1423N , K1467L , and R1423N / K1467L . For the mutant simulations , a snapshot of the formin / actin system from the end of the long WT simulation was taken as the starting structure . All visualizations were done with VMD ( Humphrey et al . , 1996 ) . Data from a simulation of an Oda actin ﬁlament 30 - mer was also used to ascertain the actin twist angle distribution for comparison with the formin - bound barbed - end simulations . The initial geometry of the Oda 30 - mer was identical to the Oda 7 - mer but without formin bound at the barbed end . After minimization , heating , and equilibration phases , the simulation was run for approximately 160 ns . Additional details of the simulation protocol are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Formin / Actin CG Model CG models of actin and Bni1p were created to study the long timescale behavior of small actin / Bni1p complexes ( Figure 4 ) . A residue - based model ( sites for each amino acid were placed on the alpha - carbon ) , with a heteroe - lastic network model ( hENM ) ( Lyman et al . , 2008 ) for the intraprotein interactions and charge and excluded volume interactions for interprotein in - teractions , was chosen . In the intraprotein hENM CG models of actin and Bni1p , two sites were connected if the distance between them was less than 10 A ˚ . The charges , excluded volume , and hENM bond lengths and force con - stants were parameterized using the all - atom MD simulation data . Bni1p charges for CG WT simulation were parameterized from the WT simulation , Figure 8 .

The starting orientation for Bni1p on actin in the CG model was taken from the end of the all - atom WT simulation . All CG simulations were performed with LAMMPS ( Plimpton , 1995 ) . Pairwise interactions ( charge and excluded vol - ume ) were computed on graphics processing units as implemented in LAMMPS ( Brown et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) . The simulations were carried out at 310K in the NVT ensemble with Langevin dynamics ( 1 , 000 fs damping param - eter ) . Additional details can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Plasmid Construction Bni1 ( pP1FH2 ) p ( residues 1312 – 1766 ) was inserted into a pGV67 plasmid , which encodes an N - terminal glutathione S - transferase tag , and the R1423N and K1467L mutations were made with standard cloning methods ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . The Supplemental Experimental Procedures describe details of the protein puriﬁcation process . Microscopy We generated time - lapse movies of actin ﬁlaments using prism - style TIRF mi - croscopy on an Olympus IX - 70 inverted microscope by collecting images every 10 s with a Hamamatsu C4742 - 95 CCD ( Orca - ER ) camera and Meta - Morph software ( Molecular Devices ) . Images were processed with ImageJ software ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . For each sample , we measured the rates of barbed - end elongation of 10 – 20 ﬁlaments , typically over a span of at least 300 s . Glass ﬂow chambers ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) were incubated for 1 min each with 0 . 5 % Tween 80 in high - salt Tris - buffered saline ( HS - TBS ) ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 600 mM KCl ) , 250 nM N - ethylmaleimide - inactivated skeletal muscle myosin in HS - TBS , and 10 % BSA ( w / v ) in HS - TBS , with washes of HS - TBS after each incubation step . Polymerization was initiated by mixing 1 . 5 m M actin monomers ( 33 % labeled with Oregon Green ) with or without 5 m M proﬁlin and a range of concentrations of formin in standard microscopy buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 3 mM ATP , 15 mM glucose , 50 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 0 . 02 m M CaCl 2 , 20 m g / ml catalase , 100 m g / ml glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose [ 4 , 000 cP at 2 % ( w / v ) ] ) . Pyrene - Actin Assembly Assays We collected time courses of ﬂuorescence emission with a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Gemini XPS ﬂuorescence plate reader using Corning 96 - well ﬂat - bottom plates . Reactions containing 4 m M actin ( 20 % pyrene labeled ) and a range of formin concentrations were polymerized in 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 17 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 03 mM CaCl 2 , 1 . 7 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 1 part per 10 5 ( w / v ) Antifoam 204 . Samples were excited at 365 nm , and ﬂuorescence emission intensity was sampled every 10 s at 407 nm over a period of 30 – 60 min . We converted the ﬂuorescence signal to polymer concentration by normal - izingthemaximumﬂuorescencesignalineachtracetotheﬁnalpredictedactin polymer concentration , assuming a critical concentration of 0 . 17 m M . We calculated the concentration of barbed ends in each sample using the following equation : ½ ends (cid:5) = Polymerization rate k + ½ G (cid:4) actin (cid:5) (cid:4) k (cid:4) ; ( Equation 1 ) where k + and k (cid:4) are the barbed - end association and dissociation rates , respectively , of actin . We calculated the polymerization rate from the slope of the change in ﬂuorescence signal at the point where half of the actin is polymerized .
