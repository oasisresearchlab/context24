However , it is unclear whether inflammation develops proportionally to tidal strain or only above a threshold . We aimed to 1 ) assess the relationship between regional tidal strain and local inflammation in vivo during the early stages of lung injury in lungs with regional aeration heteroge - neity comparable to that of humans and 2 ) determine how this strain - inflammation relationship is affected by endotoxemia . Design : Interventional animal study . Setting : Experimental laboratory and PET facility . Subjects : Eighteen 2 - to 4 - month - old sheep . Interventions : Three groups of sheep ( n = 6 ) were mechani - cally ventilated to the same plateau pressure ( 30 – 32 cm H 2 O ) with high - strain ( V T = 18 . 2 ± 6 . 5 mL / kg , positive end - expiratory pressure = 0 ) , high - strain plus IV lipopolysaccharide ( V T = 18 . 4 ± 4 . 2 mL / kg , positive end - expiratory pressure = 0 ) , or low - strain plus lipopolysaccharide ( V T = 8 . 1 ± 0 . 2 mL / kg , positive end - expiratory pressure = 17 ± 3 cm H 2 O ) . At baseline , we acquired respiratory - gated PET scans of inhaled 13 NN to measure tidal strain from end - expiratory and end - inspiratory images in six regions of interest . After 3 hours of mechanical ventilation , dynamic [ 18 F ] fluoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose scans were acquired to quantify metabolic activation , indicating local neutrophilic inflammation , in the same regions of interest . Measurements and Main Results : Baseline regional tidal strain had a significant effect on [ 18 F ] fluoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose net uptake rate K i in high - strain lipopolysaccharide ( p = 0 . 036 ) and on phosphorylation rate k 3 in high - strain ( p = 0 . 027 ) and high - strain lipopolysaccharide ( p = 0 . 004 ) . Lipopolysaccharide exposure increased the k 3 - tidal strain slope three - fold ( p = 0 . 009 ) , without significant lung edema . The low - strain lipopolysaccharide group showed lower baseline regional tidal strain ( 0 . 33 ± 0 . 17 ) than high - strain ( 1 . 21 ± 0 . 62 ; p < 0 . 001 ) or high - strain lipopolysac - charide ( 1 . 26 ± 0 . 44 ; p < 0 . 001 ) and lower k 3 ( p < 0 . 001 ) and K i ( p < 0 . 05 ) than high - strain lipopolysaccharide . Conclusions : Local inflammation develops proportionally to regional tidal strain during early lung injury . The regional inflammatory effect of strain is greatly amplified by IV lipopolysaccharide . Tidal strain enhances local [ 18 F ] fluoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose uptake primarily by increasing the rate of intracellular [ 18 F ] fluoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose phosphorylation . ( Crit Care Med 2014 ; 42 : e491 – e500 ) Key Words : endotoxemia ; lung inflammation ; lung strain ; mechanical ventilation ; positron emission tomography ; ventilator - induced lung injury V entilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) is thought to result from excessive deformation of the lungs during mechanical ventilation ( 1 , 2 ) . This deformation can be described by volumetric strain , defined as the change in lung volume relative to an initial lung volume ( 2 ) . Protti et al ( 3 ) recently reported a critical threshold of whole - lung strain , cor - responding to tidal volumes ( V T s ) greater than 20 mL / kg , above which ventilator - induced lung edema ultimately develops in Copyright © 2014 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins DOI : 10 . 1097 / CCM . 0000000000000346 * See also p . 1745 . 1 Department of Biomedical Engineering , Boston University , Boston , MA . 2 Department of Anesthesia , Critical Care and Pain Medicine , Massachu - setts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA . 3 Pulmonary and Critical Care Unit , Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA . 4 Biostatistics Center , Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medi - cal School , Boston , MA .

However , VILI has been shown to develop at sig - nificantly lower V T in patients ( 4 – 7 ) and animals ( 8 , 9 ) . This discrepancy may be explained by at least two factors . First , even presumably safe V T s may produce excessive local strains as a result of strain heterogeneity in supine patients ( 10 ) and large animals ( 11 – 15 ) . Second , lung sensitivity to strain may increase in the presence of additional inflammatory stimuli , such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( 16 , 17 ) . Lung inflammation is a key early process in VILI that may precede and contribute to the development of edema . Bellani and coworkers indicated that pulmonary [ 18 F ] fluoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose ( 18 F - FDG ) uptake , a well - established marker of neu - trophilic inflammation in lung injury ( 18 – 22 ) , is linearly related to tidal gas volume changes in normally aerated regions of acute lung injury ( ALI ) patients mechanical ventilated for 9 ± 7 days ( 23 ) . However , because they studied the later stages of injury and did not measure tidal strain ( 24 ) , the role of regional tidal strain in the early development of inflammation remains unclear . We recently developed a respiratory - gated PET technique to measure regional tidal strain during mechanical ventilation ( 13 ) and advanced methods to quantify regional pulmonary inflam - mation from 18 F - FDG kinetics ( 25 , 26 ) . In the present study , we leverage these PET techniques to investigate the following hypotheses in mechanically ventilated , heterogeneously aer - ated sheep lungs : 1 ) regional lung inflammation , assessed from 18 F - FDG kinetics , develops in proportion to regional tidal lung strain ; 2 ) the effect of tidal strain on regional inflammation is synergistically increased by systemic LPS exposure ; and 3 ) reduc - tion of regional tidal strain is a major determinant of decreased pulmonary inflammation during protective ventilation . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal Preparation Study protocols were approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care of the Massachusetts General Hospital , and handling of the animals was in accord with National Insti - tutes of Health guidelines . Sheep ( 21 . 5 ± 4 . 9 kg ) were fasted overnight and premedicated with intramuscular ketamine ( 4 mg / kg ) and midazolam ( 1 – 2 mg / kg ) . Following induction of anesthesia with IV propofol ( 2 – 4 mg / kg ) , an endotracheal tube was inserted , and a femoral artery and a jugular vein were cannulated . General anesthesia was maintained with continu - ous infusion of propofol and fentanyl titrated to heart rate and blood pressure . Pancuronium was used for muscle paral - ysis at induction ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) and repeated every 90 minutes ( 0 . 02 – 0 . 04 mg / kg ) . Experimental Procedures We studied three groups of mechanically ventilated sheep ( n = 6 animals / group ) . The first group ( high - strain ) aimed to produce high regional tidal strain while avoiding excessive pla - teau pressure ( P PLAT ) by using zero positive end - expiratory pres - sure ( PEEP ) and continuously adjusting V T to maintain P PLAT within 30 – 32 cm H 2 O ( baseline V T = 18 . 2 ± 6 . 5 mL / kg ) . The second group ( high - strain LPS ) combined the same protocol ( baseline V T = 18 . 4 ± 4 . 2 mL / kg , PEEP = 0 ) with continuous IV LPS infusion ( 10 ng / kg / min , Escherichia coli O55 : B5 , List Biologic Laboratories , Campbell , CA ) for the duration of ven - tilation ( 3 . 1 ± 0 . 8 hr ) , beginning after baseline image acquisi - tion . The third group ( low - strain LPS ) received the same LPS dose and protective ventilation ( 27 ) , with V T = 8 mL / kg and PEEP continuously adjusted to maintain P PLAT = 30 – 32 cm H 2 O ( baseline PEEP = 17 . 1 ± 3 . 4 cm H 2 O ) . This protocol aimed to reduce the tidal ( i . e . , dynamic ) component of lung strain while maintaining peak strain similar to the other groups . In each animal , a recruitment maneuver ( 40 s at airway pressure = 35 cm H 2 O ) was performed at baseline to standard - ize lung volume history . Additional ventilatory settings were as follows : F io 2 initially at 0 . 3 and adjusted to achieve an arterial oxygen saturation greater than 0 . 88 , inspiratory - to - expiratory time ratio ( I : E ) = 1 : 2 , and respiratory rate ( RR ) = 18 breaths / min or higher to maintain the Pa co 2 between 32 and 45 mm Hg . A variable dead space was added to the breathing circuit if Pa co 2 was less than 32 mm Hg with RR = 18 breaths / min . PET Imaging Sheep were positioned supine in the PET camera ( Scanditronix PC4096 , GE Healthcare , Milwaukee , WI ) , with the most caudal slice of the 9 . 7 cm field of view adjacent to the diaphragmatic dome . The following scans were acquired after 10 minutes ( baseline ) or 3 . 1 ± 0 . 8 hours of mechanical ventilation ( end ) : 1 . Transmission scans ( baseline , end ) : obtained during 10 minutes of continuous breathing to correct emission scans for tissue attenuation and measure lung density . These scans were processed to construct images of average fractional gas content at baseline ( F GAS , BL ) and end ( F GAS , END ) ( 13 ) . 2 . Respiratory - gated 13 NN emission scans ( baseline , end ) : acquired to measure regional tidal strain from regional aeration at end expiration and end inspiration ( 13 ) . Briefly , 13 NN gas was added to a rebreathing system and equili - brated with the lungs for 6 – 10 minutes ( gas activity , ~ 300 kBq / mL ) . Respiratory - gated imaging was used to track the dynamic changes in pulmonary 13 NN concentration dur - ing continuous mechanical ventilation . Over a 5 - minute acquisition period , images of regional 13 NN activity were collected into six bins of equal duration , representing six distinct phases of the respiratory cycle ( i . e . , two bins during inspiration and four during expiration ) . 3 . 18 F - FDG emission scans ( end ) : acquired to assess local met - abolic activation ( 18 ) . 18 F - FDG ( ~ 200 MBq ) was infused over 60 seconds through a jugular catheter . Simultaneously , a dynamic PET scan was started , consisting of 37 sequential frames ( 9 × 10 s , 4 × 15 s , 1 × 30 s , 7 × 60 s , 15 × 120 s , 1 × 300 s ) . PET images were reconstructed with voxel size of 2 × 2 × 6 . 5 mm using a convolution backprojection algorithm . Images were decay corrected to time zero and filtered in - plane with a circular moving average filter of diameter 12 mm and along the z - axis with a 2 - point moving average filter . Each frame yielded a 128 × 128 × 14 matrix with effective volumetric resolution of 1 . 66 cm 3 . Online Laboratory Investigations Critical Care Medicine www . ccmjournal . org e493 Definition of Lung Fields for Analysis Volumetric masks of lung fields were delineated at both time points ( baseline and end ) for end expiration ( EE ) , end inspi - ration ( EI ) , and mean lung volume by : 1 ) including all voxels with F GAS greater than 0 . 5 ; 2 ) adding perfused but poorly aer - ated lung regions viewed in the end - apnea frames of the 13 NN infusion scan ; and 3 ) manually excluding the trachea , two main bronchi , and major blood vessels . Six regions of interest ( ROIs ) were defined for each animal by dividing the lung field in half along the cephalocaudal axis and further dividing each half along the ventral - dorsal axis into three subregions of equal height ( Fig . 1 A ) . Image Analysis End - expiratory and end - inspiratory images of equilibrated 13 NN were normalized by the 13 NN specific activity to obtain images of fractional gas content at end expiration ( F EE ) and end inspiration ( F EI ) ( 13 ) . In each ROI , tidal specific volume change ( sVol , defined as the change in gas volume during inspiration divided by end - expiratory gas volume ) was com - puted from average F EE and F EI , according to Fuld et al ( 11 ) : sVol EI EE EE EI = − − F F F F ( ) 1 In corresponding ROIs in the 18 F - FDG images , the three - compartment Sokoloff model ( 28 ) was fit to 18 F - FDG kinetics using iterative optimization . The 18 F - FDG concen - tration within a blood pool ROI drawn over the right heart was used as an input function for the model after calibration with manual blood samples ( 29 ) . For each ROI , we obtained three variables describing 18 F - FDG kinetics : the fractional distribution volume of 18 F - FDG in tissue ( F e ) , the rate of 18 F - FDG phosphorylation ( k 3 ) , and the net uptake rate ( K i ) , where K i = F e · k 3 . Statistical Analysis Data are presented as mean ± sd unless otherwise noted , and significance was set at p less than 0 . 05 . Global variables were compared between groups using one - way analysis of variance with Tukey - Kramer post hoc tests for normally distributed data or Kruskal - Wallis with Bonferroni - corrected Mann - Whitney tests otherwise . All regional measurements , including sVol , F EE , F EI , K i , F e , and k 3 , were compared between groups using linear mixed - effects models with group ( categorical ) as a fixed effect and random intercepts for each animal to account for repeated measurements ( i . e . , six ROIs per animal ) . To test for effects of ROI position on sVol , we also modeled sVol with fixed effects for ROI ventral - dorsal and cephalocaudal positions in each group and random intercepts and position effects in each animal . To determine effects of sVol on 18 F - FDG variables , we modeled each 18 F - FDG variable ( K i , F e , and k 3 ) as an interac - tion between sVol and group ( i . e . , allowing different effects of sVol in each group ) and included random intercepts and sVol effects for each animal . A heterogeneous covariance structure was used in the K i , F e , and k 3 models to allow for different vari - ances among groups . All analyses were performed using Mat - lab ( R2013b Statistics Toolbox , The Mathworks , Natick , MA ) . RESULTS Global Cardiorespiratory Variables Consistent with the study design , high - strain groups received higher V T and lower levels of PEEP and RRs than the low - strain LPS group ( Table 1 ) . Pa o 2 / F io 2 decreased by the end of the study only in the high - strain LPS group . Figure 1 . Configuration of regions of interest ( ROIs ) for sVol computation ( A ) , distributions of baseline sVol ( sVol BL ) along the gravitational axis ( B ) , and changes in sVol ( Δ sVol ) from baseline to the study end ( sVol END ) ( C ) . Use of six ROIs in each sheep ( A ) resulted in a median ROI volume of 89 mL , with distinct ROI positions along the gravitational axis . Mixed - model regression lines in ( B ) show a significant gravitational dependence of sVol BL in the combined high - strain ( gray triangles ) and high - strain lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( black circles ) groups , but not in the low - strain LPS group ( white circles ) . Values of Δ sVol were mostly small ( C ) , with averages ( mean ± sd ) close to zero . No systematic change in sVol was observed in any of the groups . Wellman et al e494 www . ccmjournal . org July 2014 • Volume 42 • Number 7 Topographic Heterogeneity of Tidal Strain At baseline , the high - strain groups showed large , heterogeneous changes in aeration between end expiration and end inspira - tion ( Fig . 2 ) ( Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A918 ) . By contrast , animals in the low - strain LPS group showed smaller and more homogeneously distrib - uted tidal changes in aeration . There was a significant gravita - tional dependence of sVol , with highest values in dependent regions , in both the high - strain ( p < 0 . 001 ) and high - strain LPS groups ( p = 0 . 004 ) , but not in the low - strain LPS group ( Fig . 1 B ) . No dependence of sVol on ROI cephalocaudal posi - tion was detected in any group . The magnitude of regional sVol was different among the groups at baseline , as expected from the applied ventilator set - tings . Both high - strain groups presented significantly higher sVol than the low - strain LPS group ( Table 2 and Fig . 1 B ) . Of note , in the high - strain groups , a considerable fraction of ROIs presented sVol greater than 1 . 5 ( 28 % of all non - LPS ROIs , 17 % for LPS ) , with some regions even showing sVol greater than 2 ( 8 % for both ) , despite global sVol values ( computed from whole - lung average F EE and F EI ) being close to 1 ( Table 2 ) . Measurements of sVol at the end of the experiments reflected similar distributions to those at baseline ( Table 2 and Fig . 1 C ) . No systematic changes in sVol over time were observed in any of the groups . Strong correlations were found between sVol at the end and baseline sVol for measurements from all groups ( sVol end = 0 . 76 · sVol baseline + 0 . 15 , r = 0 . 76 , p < 0 . 001 ) , indicating stable topographic distributions of sVol over time . Relationship of Regional Metabolic Activation With Tidal Strain Regional 18 F - FDG net uptake rate K i , volume of distribution F e , and rate of phosphorylation k 3 showed significant gravita - tional dependence ( Supplemental Digital Content 2 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A919 ) , with highest values in dependent regions ( Fig . 2 ) . Applying the mixed - effects model to measure - ments in ROIs , K i showed a significant linear association with sVol in the high - strain LPS group ( p = 0 . 036 ) , but not in the high - strain or low - strain LPS groups ( Fig . 3 A ) . The components of K i ( K i = F e · k 3 ) were differently associated with regional strain . Whereas the 18 F - FDG volume of distribution F e was not associ - ated with sVol in any of the groups ( Fig . 3 B ) , the 18 F - FDG rate of phosphorylation k 3 was associated with sVol in the high - strain ( p = 0 . 027 ) and high - strain LPS groups ( p = 0 . 004 ) ( Fig . 3 C ) but not in the low - strain LPS group ( Fig . 3 D ) . The high - strain LPS group showed higher values of k 3 ( p < 0 . 001 ) than the low - strain LPS group . These findings imply that the increase in K i with increasing sVol following LPS exposure occurred predomi - nantly through a higher k 3 , indicating enhanced intracellular phosphorylation of 18 F - FDG in regions with higher tidal strain .

Online Laboratory Investigations Critical Care Medicine www . ccmjournal . org e495 Effect of LPS on the Relationship Between Tidal Strain and Metabolic Activation By exposing the lungs to LPS during high - strain ventilation , the magnitude of the effect of sVol on k 3 increased by a factor of 3 . 3 ( 2 . 14 × 10 – 2 vs 0 . 65 × 10 – 2 min – 1 , p = 0 . 009 ) ( Fig . 3 C ) . Thus , the lung metabolic response to tidal strain was enhanced by more than a factor of 3 in the presence of LPS . This increase in the k 3 versus sVol slope with LPS exposure was clearly evident by examining individual animal regressions in the mixed - effects model ( Supplemental Digi - tal Content 3 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A920 ) . In addition to these differences in slope , inter - cepts of the mixed - effects model of k 3 tended to be higher in LPS groups ( high - strain = 3 . 90 × 10 – 2 min – 1 , low - strain = 3 . 86 × 10 – 2 min – 1 ) than in the high - strain group ( 2 . 45 × 10 – 2 min – 1 , p = 0 . 108 vs high - stain LPS , p = 0 . 022 vs low - strain LPS ) ( Fig . 3 C ) . These results suggest that LPS has both an independent Figure 2 . Images of transverse planes from a representative animal in each group . Fractional gas content at end expiration ( F EE ) and end inspiration ( F EI ) as well as [ 18 F ] fluoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose ( 18 F - FDG ) net uptake rate ( K i ) showed notable heterogeneity along the gravitational axis in both high - strain groups . With high - strain ventilation , K i increased with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) exposure , particularly in the dependent lung . Concentrated 18 F - FDG uptake was not observed with protective ventilation ( low - strain ) , where F EE and F EI were more homogeneous and LPS appeared to produce a small global increase in K i .

Data from the low - strain LPS group were highly concentrated in the k 3 – sVol plot ( Fig . 3 D ) , highlighting the homogeneity of those variables in this group . Importantly , those points fell along the mixed - model regression line defined by the high - strain LPS group . To show this quantitatively , the data were grouped accord - ing to LPS exposure and reanalyzed with the mixed - effects model ( i . e . , low - strain and high - strain LPS groups combined ) . In this model , parameters of the combined LPS group were not signifi - cantly different from those of the high - strain LPS alone ( Fig . 3 D ) , in terms of slope ( 1 . 96 × 10 – 2 [ all LPS ] vs 2 . 14 × 10 – 2 [ high - strain LPS only ] min – 1 , p = 0 . 79 ) or intercept ( 3 . 58 × 10 – 2 vs 3 . 90 × 10 – 2 min – 1 , p = 0 . 60 ) . Given that data from all LPS - exposed animals followed the same global trend ( dotted line , Fig . 3 D ) , the reduc - tion in metabolic activation with protective ( i . e . , low - strain ) ventilation presumably occurred through the reduction of sVol , shifting lung regions downward along that regression line . The maximum regional k 3 was highest in the high - strain LPS group ( Fig . 4 ) . Among LPS - exposed animals , low - strain ventilation reduced the maximum k 3 by 43 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Comparing high - strain groups , there was a trend toward higher minimum k 3 with LPS ( p < 0 . 10 ) , support - ing the presence of a small independent effect of LPS on metabolic activation even in regions of lowest tidal strain . Additional Variables Influencing Regional Inflammation In addition to tidal strain , we also studied the associations of k 3 with other variables potentially influ - encing inflammation : regional tidal recruitment , perfusion , aver - age lung inflation level ( F GAS ) , hyperinflation , consolidated atel - ectasis , and intraregional heteroge - neity of tidal strain ( Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A918 ) . Using the same mixed - effects model used to study the association of sVol with k 3 , we found no associations of perfusion or hyperinflation with k 3 . Average F GAS was inversely associated with k 3 in all groups . In the high - strain LPS group , but not in the high - strain group , k 3 was associ - ated with tidal recruitment of voxels with F GAS less than 0 . 1 ( p = 0 . 019 ) and 0 . 1 < F GAS < 0 . 3 ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 5 ) , as well as with intraregional heterogeneity of specific ventilation ( p = 0 . 002 ) , measured from 13 NN wash - out ( 30 ) . Among all studied independent variables , regional k 3 was the most strongly associated with sVol in lungs with and without LPS exposure ( Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A918 ) . Histologic Injury Regional tissue injury was mild in all groups ( Supplemental Digi - tal Content 4 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A921 ) . LPS exposure significantly increased tissue neutrophil counts in both ventral and dorsal regions , with similar neutrophil counts between LPS groups . No interstitial or alveolar edema was observed in any group .

[ 18 F ] fluoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose net uptake rate K i ( A ) , volume of distribution F e ( B ) , and phosphorylation rate k 3 versus regional sVol ( C and D ) for all ROIs of all animals in the high - strain group ( gray triangles ) , high - strain lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) group ( black circles ) , and low - strain LPS group ( white circles ) . Regression lines in ( A and C ) show significant effects of sVol in the high - strain ( gray line ) and high - strain LPS ( black line ) groups , determined with the mixed - effects models of K i and k 3 . No significant effects of sVol were found in the low - strain LPS group . C , Comparing the high - strain groups , the slope of k 3 versus sVol was 3 . 3 times higher ( p = 0 . 009 ) and the intercept was 1 . 6 times higher ( p = 0 . 108 ) with LPS exposure . D , Comparing the LPS groups , the low - strain protocol led to lower values of sVol ( p < 0 . 001 ) and k 3 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , which fell along the same k 3 – sVol relationship defined by the high - strain LPS group . When the mixed - effects model was fit to all LPS animals together ( dotted line ) , the regression line was not significantly different from that of high - strain LPS alone ( solid line ) , implying a similar dependence of k 3 on sVol in all LPS animals . Online Laboratory Investigations Critical Care Medicine www . ccmjournal . org e497 results in topographically heterogenous local tidal strain , with highest values in dependent regions ; 2 ) in both normal and LPS - exposed lungs ventilated with high V T s , 18 F - FDG phos - phorylation rate k 3 is significantly associated with regional tidal strain ; 3 ) exposure to LPS substantially increases the slope of the k 3 versus sVol regression , indicating local synergistic inter - action between tidal strain and LPS ; and 4 ) use of low V T s and high PEEP decreases the magnitude of regional tidal strain and produces a corresponding reduction in k 3 , supporting a direct effect of tidal strain on regional metabolic activation . We found significant topographic heterogeneity of tidal strain in the high - strain groups . Of note , a substantial fraction of lung regions presented sVol greater than 1 . 5 , despite global values being close to 1 , reinforcing that high levels of regional strain may be present even when global strain is within a pre - sumably safe range ( 11 – 15 , 31 ) . Although we used relatively large V T to achieve those high strains , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) lungs may exhibit similar levels of strain at much lower V T . In fact , Chiumello et al ( 32 ) found global strains in the range of 1 – 1 . 5 in patients ventilated with V T between 6 and 12 mL / kg and PEEP = 5 cm H 2 O . Considering the substan - tial heterogeneity of strain and compliance observed in ARDS models ( 14 , 33 ) , it is plausible that local strains as high as 2 could exist in patients with global strains greater than 1 . Tidal strain appeared to have a direct effect on the regional 18 F - FDG net uptake rate K i in lungs with LPS exposure . We and others have established that K i is a sensitive marker of neutro - philic inflammation in humans ( 34 , 35 ) and animal models of lung injury ( 19 – 21 ) . Since K i is the product of k 3 and F e , we fur - ther examined the dependence of these K i components on tidal strain . We found that k 3 had the strongest associations with sVol , both with and without LPS exposure , whereas F e showed no associations with sVol . In contrast to K i and F e , which are expected to be linearly related to local tissue density , k 3 should not depend directly on tissue density as it represents the aver - age rate of intracellular 18 F - FDG phosphorylation within the tissue compartment of a region of interest ( 28 ) . Indeed , given that K i = F e · k 3 , if F e is linearly related to tissue density ( as sup - ported by our data in Supplemental Digital Content 2 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A919 ) , k 3 must be independent from it in order to confer the linear dependence of K i on tissue density . Thus , k 3 is expected to depend only on the specific metabolic state of the cells present in the tissue , providing an index of cellular metabolic activity independent of tissue density . In the high - strain group , increased k 3 in response to tidal stretching may have resulted from normal physiologic responses to stretch such as deformation - induced lipid trafficking ( 36 ) or cyto - skeletal reorganization ( 37 ) . Given the high neutrophil counts observed after LPS exposure , the increased metabolic activa - tion with strain in LPS animals more likely reflects the trig - gering of inflammatory processes , with increased number and activation of neutrophils as well as contributions from other cells ( 20 ) . Interestingly , while neutrophil counts were similar between the LPS groups , metabolic activation was significantly greater with high - strain than with low - strain ventilation , sug - gesting that tidal strain primarily affected the activation of sequestered neutrophils rather than causing recruitment of additional neutrophils . IV LPS remarkably amplified the effect of tidal strain on metabolic activation , increasing the slope of the k 3 – sVol regression by more than a factor of 3 . Thus , the increase in metabolic activation caused by a moderate LPS dose was larger in regions of higher tidal strain , implying the presence of local synergy between tidal strain and LPS . While synergy between stretch and LPS in producing cytokine release has been documented in isolated epithelial cells ( 38 ) , macro - phages ( 39 ) , and small animal models ( 16 , 17 ) , our findings demonstrate the relevance of regional interactions between strain and other inflammatory stimuli in large , heterogeneous lungs . Such interactions could play an important role in gen - erating the marked topographic heterogeneity of inflamma - tion observed in ARDS patients ( 40 ) . Additionally , increased sensitivity of the lungs to tidal strain when additional inflam - matory stimuli are present may help to reconcile the findings of Protti et al ( 3 ) , where injury did not occur until V T greater than 20 mL / kg , with evidence of VILI in patients ventilated with much lower V T ( 5 , 41 – 43 ) . The absence of histological lung edema in all groups , despite significant neutrophilic inflammation in the LPS groups , sug - gests that the inflammatory response to tidal strain may either precede the formation of edema or may occur at lower val - ues of strain , below the threshold for edema if such exists . Accordingly , our findings suggest that metabolic changes may be more sensitive than measurements of edema for detection of early processes in the development of lung injury . Importantly , the observed association between regional lung strain and inflammation occurred over a range of strain values lower than those whole - lung strains previously observed to cause edema ( 3 ) . Thus , even if strains applied in routine mechanical ventila - tion are not large enough to ultimately produce edema , such Figure 4 . Minimum and maximum regional k 3 in each group . Comparing high - strain groups , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) appeared to have a small effect on minimum k 3 and significantly increased maximum k 3 . Comparing LPS groups , the low - strain LPS protocol greatly reduced the maximum k 3 in relation to high - strain LPS , though minimum values of k 3 were similar . † p < 0 . 10 , * p < 0 . 05 , and * * p < 0 . 01 . Wellman et al e498 www . ccmjournal . org July 2014 • Volume 42 • Number 7 strains could still trigger early inflammation , potentially with clinically relevant consequences . Mechanical and physiologic factors other than tidal strain may have provoked inflammation in our studies . In the high - strain LPS group , we found associations of k 3 with tidal recruitment and ventilation heterogeneity ( Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A918 ) although these were not as strong as the association with tidal strain . Nonetheless , it is possible that low - volume injury mechanisms may have contributed to the genesis of inflammation in this group . Indeed , high interfacial stresses that occur during tidal recruitment can injure epithelial cell plasma membranes ( 44 , 45 ) . In normal lungs ( e . g . , high - strain group ) , healthy surfac - tant function may prevent or delay injury by these mechanisms . However , LPS - dependent surfactant dysfunction can produce higher surface tensions ( 46 ) , with consequent increase in the risk of cell injury . Such effects of LPS could be partly respon - sible for the observed association between inflammation and tidal recruitment in the high - strain LPS animals . However , our data point to tidal strain as a more important determi - nant of early regional inflammation in the studied normal and LPS - exposed lungs . Our finding that average lung inflation ( i . e . , F GAS ) was neg - atively associated with metabolic activation ( Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A918 ) sug - gests that inflammation was not provoked by high static ( i . e . , continuously applied ) strain , but by the dynamic component of strain induced by tidal inflation . This result is in line with recent findings of dynamic strain as a more important deter - minant of whole - lung edema and inflammation than static strain ( 3 ) . We expand on those findings by showing that this predominant sensitivity of the lungs to dynamic strain applies to the early regional development of inflammation , before any histologic measures of tissue injury or edema are detectable . Methodological limitations to our study include the follow - ing : 1 ) Our measurements of sVol could be affected by tidal recruitment . PET estimates of recruitment were associated with k 3 , yet less so than tidal strain and only in the high - strain LPS group ( Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : / / links . lww . com / CCM / A918 ) . Higher resolution CT techniques may be required to further study the respective roles of recruitment and tidal strain . 2 ) We computed strain using end - expiratory gas volume in the denominator as done previously ( 47 ) although others have used functional residual capacity ( 48 ) . Although the definition of lung “resting volume” remains arbitrary ( 1 ) and will affect the computation of strain ( 2 ) , our choice was consistent with the goal of quantifying the dynamic component of strain in the studied conditions . 3 ) Registration errors between end expiration and end inspiration could pro - duce error in sVol measurements . We mitigated this by study - ing large ROIs ( 13 ) and computing sVol from average regional F EE and F EI , which are relatively insensitive to registration errors ( 11 , 13 ) . 4 ) Regional metabolic activation was used as a surrogate for inflammation . Although we did not measure tis - sue markers of inflammation ( e . g . , cytokines ) , 18 F - FDG uptake in itself is an established marker of neutrophilic inflammation in acutely injured lungs ( 18 – 22 , 49 ) . CONCLUSIONS During mechanical ventilation of supine lungs similar in size to human lungs , high regional lung strains may be present even when global lung strain is within acceptable limits . Regional lung metabolic activation , reflecting the development of local inflammation , shows a positive linear relation with tidal strain , and this dependence is substantially amplified by moderate LPS exposure even when lung edema is not apparent . Such localized metabolic activation is prevented by reducing and homogenizing regional tidal strain with high PEEP and low V T .
