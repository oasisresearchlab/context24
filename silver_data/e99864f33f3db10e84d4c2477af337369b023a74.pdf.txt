Deregulation of Rac signaling in cancer is generally a consequence of enhanced upstream inputs from tyrosine - kinase receptors , PI3K or Guanine nucleotide Ex - change Factors ( GEFs ) , or reduced Rac inactivation by GTPase Activating Proteins ( GAPs ) . In breast cancer cells Rac1 is a downstream effector of ErbB receptors and mediates migratory responses by ErbB1 / EGFR li - gands such as EGF or TGF α and ErbB3 ligands such as heregulins . Recent advances in the ﬁ eld led to the iden - ti ﬁ cation of the Rac - GEF P - Rex1 as an essential mediator of Rac1 responses in breast cancer cells . P - Rex1 is activated by the PI3K product PIP3 and G βγ subunits , and integrates signals from ErbB receptors and GPCRs . Most notably , P - Rex1 is highly overexpressed in human luminal breast tumors , particularly those expressing ErbB2 and estrogen receptor ( ER ) . The P - Rex1 / Rac signaling pathway may represent an attractive target for breast cancer therapy . © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc . Contents 1 .

Introduction The Rho / Rac GTPases are a family of small G - proteins widely impli - cated in normal physiology and disease . They play an important role in cytoskeleton rearrangements and are key regulators of cellular adhe - sion , migration , proliferation , survival , differentiation and malignant transformation [ 1 ] . Members of this family in humans are divided into 6 classes : Rho ( RhoA , RhoB and RhoC ) , Rac ( Rac1 , Rac2 , Rac3 and RhoG ) , Cdc42 ( Cdc42 , Tc10 , TCL , Chp / Wrch - 2 and Wrch - 1 ) , RhoBTB , Rnd and RhoT [ 2 ] . The most studied members are RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 . Like most GTPases , Rho , Rac and Cdc42 function as molecular switches that cycle between an inactive state that binds GDP and an ac - tive state thatbinds GTP . GTPis hydrolyzed to GDPthrough their intrin - sic GTPase activity to render the G - protein inactive [ 3 ] . The switch between GDP and GTP is primarily regulated by two types of proteins : GEFs ( Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors ) that facilitate GTP loading and thereby activate the small G - protein , and GAPs ( GTPase Activating Proteins ) that stimulate the hydrolysis of GTP by enhancing intrinsic GTPase activity , thus leading to G - protein inactivation . A third class of proteins known as Rho GDIs ( GDP Dissociation Inhibitors ) sequesters the inactive GTPases in the cytosol , preventing their translocation and subsequent activation . Dissociation from Rho GDI becomes essential for proper activation of the G proteins [ 4 – 6 ] . Rac isoforms have a very high degree of homology . The greatest di - vergenceisintheC - terminalend , whichisalsothehypervariableregion in Ras [ 7 ] . This domain is important for driving subcellular localization and binding to speci ﬁ c cellular regulators [ 8 ] . Rac2 shares signi ﬁ cant nucleotide sequence identity ( ~ 88 % ) with the other Rac isoforms . At the nucleotide level Rac3 has 77 % identity with Rac1 , 83 % identity with Rac2 and 69 % identity with RhoG . At the amino acid level , Rac3 has 92 % identity with Rac1 and 89 % identity with Rac2 . The Rac1 gene localizes to chromosome 7 ( 7p22 ) and comprises 7 exons over a length of 29 kB [ 9 ] . Rac1 , but not Rac2 or Rac3 genes , con - tains anadditionalexon 3b thatisincluded by alternativesplicingin the variant Rac1b , a constitutively activemutant thatis expressed mainly in colon and breast cancer [ 10 , 11 ] . Rac1 is ubiquitouslyexpressed , and it is involved in signal transduction pathways that control proliferation , ad - hesion , and migration . Its inactivation bygene targetinginmiceleads to embryonic lethality caused by both gastrulation defects and apoptosis of mesodermal cells [ 12 ] . The Rac2 gene contains 7 exons in chromosome 22 ( 22q13 . 1 ) [ 13 ] and its expression is silenced in non - hematopoietic cells by DNA methylation [ 14 ] . Rac2 - de ﬁ cient mice show defects in neutrophil , macrophage , mast cell , lymphocyte B and lymphocyte T function [ 15 , 16 ] . Rac2 plays an important role in integrin - mediated hemato - poietic stem - cell adhesion [ 17 ] . Patients with impaired Rac2 function display major alterations in hematopoiesis and an immunode ﬁ ciency syndrome [ 18 , 19 ] . The Rac3 gene encompasses 6 exons in chromosome 17 ( 17q25 . 3 ) . Rac3 is primarily expressed in brain , although its expression has been reported in some human cell lines including GM04155 ( lymphoblas - tic leukemia ) , K562 ( chronic myelogenous leukemia ) , 5838 ( Ewing sarcoma ) , HL60 ( promyelocytic leukemia ) and DU4475 ( breast can - cer ) [ 8 ] . Rac3 − / − mice display slight motor coordination problems and hyperactive behavior [ 20 ] . Rac proteins associate with membranes in order to carry out their biological functions . However , unlike other Ras superfamily proteins , this anchoring step is not achieved during biosynthesis but rather re - quires a combination of intrinsic and cooperative signaling . The ﬁ rst and most crucial signal is the post - translational modi ﬁ cation of the “ CAAX box ” by incorporation of a geranyl – geranyl group or less fre - quently a farnesyl group . In cooperation with the CAAX box a closely located proline - rich domain contributes to the association of Rac with speci ﬁ c proteins in focal adhesion complexes [ 21 , 22 ] . 2 . Regulation of Rac activity by GEFs and GAPs As mentioned above , Rac cycles between inactive and active states , two conformations that depend on the binding of GDP and GTP , respectively . Guanine nucleotides have picomolar af ﬁ nities for Rac , and as a consequence their dissociation rate from the G - protein is slow . In order to lead to fast responses such as actin cytoskeleton reorganization , GEFs accelerate GDP / GTP exchange by several orders of magnitude [ 23 ] . GEFs catalyze the dissociation of the nucleotide from the G - protein by modifying the nucleotide - binding site . Rac has similar af ﬁ nities for both nucleotides , and GEF binding does not favor binding of GTP over GDP . The resulting increase in GTP - bound over GDP - bound in Rac is rather due to the higher cellular concentra - tions of GTP relative to GDP . The mechanism by which GEFs weaken the binding of the nucleotide has been investigated in detail . Accord - ing to the currently accepted model , the bound nucleotide in Rac is sandwiched between two loops called switches 1 and 2 . These re - gions together with the phosphate - binding loop interact with the phosphates and a coordinating magnesium ion [ 23 , 24 ] . As the catalyt - ic domains of GEFs display in many cases signi ﬁ cant structural differ - ences , it is possible to design drugs capable of interfering with their binding to Rac in a GEF - speci ﬁ c manner . One example is NSC23766 , a compound that binds to a surface cleft between the switch 1 and switch 2 regions of Rac and prevents the binding of GEFs Tiam1 and Trio [ 25 ] . GEFs can be promiscuous in terms of small G - protein activa - tion ( for example Vav2 activates Rho , Cdc42 and Rac ) or display se - lectivity , such as Tiam1 or P - Rex1 for Rac [ 26 , 27 ] . Rac can be activated by a variety of stimuli , including growth fac - tors ( such as EGF , PDGF , and HGF ) and G - protein - coupled receptor li - gands ( such as SDF - 1 α , sphingosine - 1 - phosphate , and bombesin ) . Tyrosine - kinase receptors may convey signals to Rac - GEFs via inter - mediate molecules , as described for P - Rex1 ( Fig . 1 ) . As a consequence Rac - GEFs may change their subcellular localization , undergo confor - mational changes that disrupt autoinhibitory mechanisms , and / or go through allosteric changes in the catalytic domain . In several cases the activation of GEFs is mediated by phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) , the product of the class I phosphoinosi - tide 3 - kinases ( PI3K ) , which binds to the PH domain present in the Rac - GEFs [ 28 ] . PI3K - independent activation of GEFs may involve their direct binding to the tyrosine - kinase receptor , as described for Vav2 with EGFR [ 29 ] . GEFs can be also tightly regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation [ 30 ] . While the mechanisms by which Rac - GEFs promote Rac activation have been extensively studied , much less is known about the basis for Rac inactivation . Rac - GAPs accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of small G - proteins by several orders of magnitude . Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that GAPs stabilize important residues of the intrinsically mobile catalytic machinery of the G - protein . Some Rac - GAPs are stringently regulated by receptor stimulation . For example , the chimaerin Rac - GAPs are activated by the lipid sec - ond messenger diacylglycerol ( DAG ) generated in response to growth factor receptor stimulation ( Fig . 1 ) . DAG binds to the C1 domain pre - sent in chimaerins to promote their redistribution to the plasma 354 E . Wertheimer et al . / Cellular Signalling 24 ( 2012 ) 353 – 362 membrane , where they bind to active GTP - bound Rac and accelerate the hydrolysis of the nucleotide . This receptor - regulated step repre - sents a mechanism that limits Rac activation in response to stimuli [ 31 – 33 ] . β 2 - Chimaerin is also regulated by protein kinase C ( PKC ) phosphorylation and through protein – protein interactions . Such mechanisms may be key for modulating subcellular localization and association to membranes [ 34 – 37 ] . 3 . Rac function and effectors A main role for Rac is the regulation of cytoskeleton reorganiza - tion , as it promotes actin assembly required for the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruf ﬂ es [ 38 ] . Regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics is essential for the maintenance of cellular morphology , po - larity , adhesion and migration [ 2 ] . The control of cytoskeleton reorga - nization via Rac involves at least two different mechanisms ( Fig . 2 ) . One is through the activation of Arp2 / 3 , which has a prominent role in actin polymerization through WAVE / Scar indirect activation . WAVE can be activated either by disassembly of the Rac – Nap1 – PIR121 complex or through IRSp53 activation [ 39 ] . A second mecha - nism for Rac - mediated cytoskeleton reorganization is through Pak ( p21 - activated kinase ) , a family that comprises 6 isoforms ( Pak1 – 6 ) . Paks have an N - terminal GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) where Rac - GTP or Cdc42 - GTP binds , and a C - terminal serine / threonine kinase domain . Binding of active Cdc42 or Rac to the GBD domain of group I Paks ( Pak 1 , 2 and 3 ) releases autoinhibition and enhances kinase activity . Some reports suggest that Cdc42 does not enhance the ki - nase activity of group II Paks ( Pak 4 , 5 and 6 ) , suggesting signi ﬁ cant differences in the regulation of these kinases [ 40 , 41 ] . Overexpression and / or hyperactivation of Pak isoforms have been detected in several cancer types , such as in breast cancer [ 41 ] . Pak1 is implicated in the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics and cell motility , transcription , survival , and cell - cycle progression [ 42 ] . Pak1 exerts its effects on cy - toskeleton organization through phosphorylation of various proteins , including LIMK ( LIM kinase ) , MLCK ( myosin light chain kinase ) , cor - tactin , and the Arpc1b subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 43 – 45 ] . In addition to its effects on actin cytoskeleton reorganization , Rac controlsanumberofadditionalfunctions , includingcellcycleregulation , endocytosis and phagocytosis [ 46 , 47 ] . Rac is also involved in integrin - mediated adhesion [ 48 ] . In addition , Rac forms part of the NADPH oxi - dase complex that generates reactive oxygen species and is involved in glucose uptake and insulin - dependent GLUT4 translocation [ 49 – 51 ] . Numerous studies established functional links between Rac andthereg - ulation of MAPKs . Rac1 regulates transcription via JNK / c - Jun [ 52 , 53 ] , is involved in p38 activation by stress stimuli such as ionomycin , UV , hyperosmolarity , and LPS [ 54 – 57 ] , activates the MKK3 / 6 – p38MAPK pathway , and mediates invasion by H - Ras in mammary epithelial cells [ 58 ] . Rac1 cooperates with Raf - 1 to activate the Erk pathway [ 59 ] . Al - though expression of active Rac does not activate Erk2 , co - expression of Raf - 1 and Rac1 synergizes for the activation of MEK1 and Erk [ 60 ] . Rac downstream effectors can also modulate the magnitude of the Rac response through feedback mechanisms [ 61 – 63 ] . 4 . Rac and cancer Malignant cancer cells display abnormal migratory properties and have the ability to invade and metastasize . Since Rac modulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell motility , impairment of Rac function by expressing a dominant - negative Rac mutants or Rac - GAPs markedly affects migration and invasiveness of cancer cells [ 32 ] . Of great interest , a recent study by Marshall and co - workers in melanoma models found that the Rac - speci ﬁ c GEF DOCK3 and the Rac effector WAVE2 are essential for promoting actin nucleation and an “ elongated ” cellular phenotype characteristic of mesenchymal behavior [ 64 ] . It is expected that the nature of the stimuli ( i . e . , integ - rins , oncogenes ) in distinct cancer cell types leads to a differential uti - lization of Rac - GEFs to promote the motile and invasive phenotype . β 2 - chimaerin P - Rex1 GDP GTP Rac PI3K γ PLC γ ErbB receptor PIP2 DAG CXCR4 α β γ GAP GEF PIP3 Rac effectors Rac Fig . 1 . A model for the regulation of Rac activity by GEFs and GAPs in breast cancer . ErbB receptors activate the PI3K - G βγ - dependent P - Rex1 through transactivation of the GPCR CXCR4 . Chimaerin Rac - GAPs are also regulated by ErbB receptors and act as a brake for the Rac activation . 355 E . Wertheimer et al . / Cellular Signalling 24 ( 2012 ) 353 – 362 Although functionally relevant Rac1 mutations have not been identi ﬁ ed in tumors , a very recent study reported a “ Rac1 risk allele ” in patients with ulcerative colitis , who have a higher risk of develop - ing colon cancer [ 65 , 66 ] . Single nucleotide polymorphism in the Rac1 gene possibly augments Rac1 protein stability , which may enhance neutrophil migration and recruitment to the colon . Patients carrying the Rac1 risk allele display higher susceptibility to the development of colonic in ﬂ ammatory bowel disease than those who do not carry that allele . Interestingly , neutrophil / macrophage - null Rac1 mice are less susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium - induced colitis and have reduced neutrophil colonic in ﬁ ltration and production of pro - in ﬂ am - matory cytokines . One speculation is that enhanced Rac signaling in cancer cells or the surrounding stroma may facilitate neutrophil re - cruitment and in ﬂ ammation . This study underscored a novel para - digm that may link in ﬂ ammation and cancer development via Rac dysfunction . Rac1 overexpression in tumors may play a role in cancer progres - sion . A recent example has been described in pancreatic cancer [ 66 , 67 ] , in which a crucial role for Rac1 for preneoplastic lesion devel - opment has been established .

The Rac signaling pathway . Rac is activated by tyrosine - kinase receptors ( RTKs ) , GPCRs , integrins and stress . Rac activation promotes changes related to cytoskeleton reor - ganization ( left ) and other responses ( right ) through multiple mediators . Rac - GTP induces the activation of WAVE through either Irsp53 or Nap125 - PIR121 complexes . WAVE ac - tivates Arp2 / 3 , leading to changes in actin cytoskeleton necessary for ruf ﬂ e formation and cell migration . Rac also activates PAK , which exerts its effects through Arp2 / 3 and LIMK activation or MLCK inhibition . In addition , Rac forms part of the NADPH oxidase complex that generates reactive oxygen species . Rac / PAK activates MAPKs implicated in stress re - sponse , mitogenesis , and survival . 356 E . Wertheimer et al . / Cellular Signalling 24 ( 2012 ) 353 – 362 neoplasia - associated actin rearrangements , and ablation of the Rac1 gene in a K - ras murine model impairs the formation of pancreatic in - traperitoneal neoplasia . Rac2 has been also linked to cancer , and both overexpression and decreased expression have been found in human brain tumors , head and neck squamous cell cancer , and leukemias . Somatic mutations in the Rac2 gene have been reported in human brain tumors [ 68 ] . Rac3 deregulation has been also linked to human cancer , including ovarian , breast , gastric , and brain cancer [ 69 – 73 ] . Despite reported changes in the expression of Rac isoforms in can - cer , it is clear that the most common cause of Rac hyperactivation is the deregulation of upstream mechanisms , including excessive input from receptors or intermediate molecules such as PI3K . Ultimately , such signals will impact on the activation status of Rac - GEFs . Indeed , several Rac - GEFs , such as Tiam1 , Ect2 and P - Rex1 , play important roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis and are up - regulated or hyper - active in cancer [ 74 – 78 ] , whereas on the other hand , there is less ev - idence for deregulation in the expression and / or function of Rac - GAPs . One example of a Rac - GEF involved in cancer is Tiam1 . Tiam1 knock - out mice are resistant to the development of skin tumors in a model of DMBA - phorbol ester chemical carcinogenesis . Paradoxically , although the number of tumors in Tiam1 − / − mice is smaller , they tend to progress to malignancy . Tiam1 de ﬁ ciency is associated with an elevated apoptotic response during initiation and reduced prolifer - ation during the promotion stage . In addition , Tiam1 mediates Ras - in - duced transformation in ﬁ broblasts . Indeed , Tiam1 associates with activated Ras , and these two oncogenes cooperate to activate Rac . There is also substantial evidence that Tiam1 is implicated in inva - siveness and metastasis [ 79 , 80 ] . Another interesting Rac - GEF involved in cancer progression is Ect2 , an oncogene that is aberrantly expressed in numerous cancer types , often as a consequence of gene ampli ﬁ cation [ 75 , 81 – 84 ] . Fields and coworkers established that Ect2 is important for cell prolifera - tion , migration , invasion and tumorigenicity of human lung cancer cells , and that Rac1 is a critical effector of Ect2 . The ability of Ect2 to support transformation in non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is linked to the activation of a Rac1 – Pak1 – Erk signaling pathway that is regulated through an oncogenic PKC ι – Par6 – Ect2 complex . PKC ι phosphorylation of Ect2 regulates the oncogenic activity of Ect2 in NSCLC cells [ 85 , 86 ] . 5 . Rac and breast cancer Rac1 was reported to be overexpressed or hyperactive in breast cancer tissues . Moreover , the active variant Rac1b is also expressed in human breast tumors [ 11 ] . Accumulating evidence indicates that the Rac effector Pak1 is implicated in breast cancer progression . In - deed , more than 50 % of human breast tumors show overexpression and / or hyperactivation of Pak1 [ 87 ] . Early studies by Kumar and co - workers showed that expression of a kinase - dead Pak1 mutant re - duced invasiveness in MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells , and conversely , a constitutively active Pak1 mutant promotes MCF - 7 cell migration , invasiveness and anchorage - independent growth [ 88 ] . Moreover , transgenic expression of an active Pak1 allele in the mouse mammary epithelium leads to the development of mammary tumors [ 89 ] . More recently , Chernoff and coworkers found a correla - tion between ErbB2 expression and Pak activation in estrogen recep - tor ( ER ) - positive human breast tumor samples . Activation of the Rac – Pak1 pathway by ErbB2 leads to a proliferative response and Erk activation [ 90 ] , consistent with previous studies showing a link between Rac1 / Pak1 and cyclin D1 induction [ 87 , 91 ] . Overexpression of ErbB2 in MCF - 10A human mammary epithelial cells and T - 47D breast cancer cells elevates Rac1 activity [ 77 , 92 ] . Actin and actinin are recruited to ErbB2 in response to TGF - β , which then co - localizes with the GEF Vav2 to activate Rac1 and Pak1 at cell protrusions [ 93 ] . As ErbB2 is overexpressed in a signi ﬁ cant fraction of human breast cancers , it is conceivable that interfering with the Rac1 / Pak1 pathway should have signi ﬁ cantly impact on breast cancer progres - sion . Proof - of - principle has been obtained by means of a speci ﬁ c Pak inhibitor , which delays tumor formation and impairs Erk activation in ErbB2 positive breast cancer cells [ 90 ] . In addition , Pak1 phosphor - ylates Ser305 in ER α , and the high Pak1 expression levels and its nu - clear localization correlate with tamoxifen resistance in ER α - positive breast cancer [ 94 – 96 ] , arguing for a potential bene ﬁ t of Pak1 inhibi - tors in reversing antiestrogen resistance . Studies in the last years revealed an important role for Rac1 in growth factor signaling in breast cancer . Our laboratory reported that the growth factor heregulin β 1 ( HRG ) causes a strong and sus - tained activation of Rac1 in breast cancer cells . While EGF also acti - vates Rac1 , this effect is rapid and short lived . Rac1 activation by HRG is mediated by ErbB3 and ErbB2 but is independent of ErbB4 , and it involves the transactivation of EGFR . Ruf ﬂ e formation and mo - tility induced by HRG are sensitive to EGFR and PI3K inhibition [ 97 ] . Cyclin D1 induction by HRG in breast cancer cells is also dependent on Rac1 and NF - κ B [ 98 ] . Emerging evidence supports a role for Rac - GEFs in the development and progression of breast cancer ( Table 1 ) . Early studies established a correlation between Tiam1 expression and high tumor grade in human breast carcinomas [ 99 ] . Moreover , highly migratory and meta - static breast cancer cell lines such as MDA - MB - 231 cells express high Tiam1 levels , and the opposite is true for less invasive models such as MCF - 7 or SK - BR - 3 cells [ 100 ] . Tiam1 binds to the cytoskeletal protein ankyrintostimulate breast tumor cell migrationand invasion [ 101 ] . Re - cent studies showing an inverse correlation between Tiam1 and the progression of breast carcinomas [ 102 ] and a lack of correlation be - tween Tiam1 expression and Rac activation status in breast cancer cells [ 103 ] strongly argue for the need to reassess the involvement of Tiam1 in breast cancer . Moreover , stromal Tiam1 may have a role in modulating malignant cell invasion and metastasis , as suppression of Tiam1 expressionin stromal ﬁ broblastssigni ﬁ cantly increases invasive - ness and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells [ 104 ] .

Enhanced Rac signaling may relate not only to Rac - GEF hyperactivation but also to deregulation of Rac - GAPs . For exam - ple , β 2 - chimaerin mRNA levels are signi ﬁ cantly down - regulated in human breast cancer cell lines and tumors . Ectopic expression of β 2 - chimaerin in MCF - 7 breast cancer cells reduces cyclin D1 levels , impairs G1 / S cell cycle progression and migration , and reduces the tu - morigenic potential of breast cancer cells [ 91 , 109 ] ( Table 1 ) . 6 . P - Rex Rac - GEFs : novel players in breast cancer Recent studies identi ﬁ ed the Rac - GEFs P - Rex1 and P - Rex2 as im - portant players in cancer , particularly in breast and prostate cancer [ 76 – 78 ] . P - Rex1 mediates Rac activation and cell motility in breast cancer cells in response to stimulation of tyrosine - kinase receptors and GPCRs . Moreover , P - Rex1 is highly expressed in human breast tu - mors relative to normal mammary tissue , arguing for a potential role for this Rac - GEF in breast cancer progression [ 77 ] . In addition , P - Rex2 is a crucial regulator of the PTEN phosphatase and possibly exerts its effects in mammary cancer cells at least in part through a Rac - inde - pendent mechanism [ 110 ] . Before expanding into these novel para - digms in breast cancer , we will describe general aspects of P - Rex regulation and function . 6 . 1 . P - Rex is dually regulated by PI3K and G βγ subunits A distinctive characteristic of P - Rex Rac - GEFs is that they are syn - ergistically activated by the PI3K product PIP3 and βγ subunits of het - erotrimeric G - proteins [ 27 , 111 – 114 ] . In vitro assays have shown that PI3K γ ( a G βγ regulated isoform of PI3K ) speci ﬁ cally activates P - Rex1 [ 27 , 111 , 112 ] . This class IB PI3K seems to serve as a point of integra - tion for upstream signals that converge on P - Rex1 [ 115 ] . Similar mechanisms appear to be necessary for the activation of P - Rex2 [ 112 ] . P - Rex1 is selectively regulated by a speci ﬁ c combination of G β and G γ subunits but cannot be directly activated by G α subunits . Studies using puri ﬁ ed recombinant proteins reconstituted into synthetic lipid vesicles demonstrated that P - Rex1 is preferentially activated by β 1 – 4 in complex with γ 2 . No activation can be observed by G β 5 γ 2 . Dimers containing the β 1 subunit in complex with a panel of different G γ subunits have varied ability to activate P - Rex1 [ 113 ] . Thus , the com - position of the G βγ dimer released upon receptor activation may be a determinant for the activation of Rac via P - Rex1 . P - Rex1 contains 28 putative PKA phosphorylation sites . It was reported that PKA inhibits the activation of P - Rex1 by PIP3 and G βγ subunits , and treatment with λ - phosphatase enhances P - Rex1 Rac - GEF activity . Phosphorylation of P - Rex1 by stimulation of β - adrenergic receptors , which leads to activation of PKA via cAMP , diminishes its ability to activate Rac1 in cells [ 116 ] . The precise site ( s ) on P - Rex1 that become phosphorylated in response to stimuli , as well as putative PKA phosphorylation sites on P - Rex2 isoforms , remain to be identi ﬁ ed . P - Rex1 translocates to membranes in response to stimulation of GPCRs , a step that is required for Rac activation . Translocation is inhibited by wortmannin ( PI3K inhibitor ) , M119 ( inhibitor of G βγ binding to effectors ) , tyrosine - kinase inhibitors , and PKA activators [ 117 ] . G βγ subunits and PI3K activity are necessary and suf ﬁ cient to promote P - Rex1 translocation and activation [ 114 ] . There has been speculation that phosphorylated P - Rex1 is inactive and resides main - ly in the cytosol , whereas dephosphorylated P - Rex1 can redistribute to membranes in response to stimuli [ 114 ] . 6 . 2 . P - Rex domains and gene regulation The human P - Rex1 gene ( PREX1 ) is located in chromosome 20 ( 20q13 . 13 ) . Montero et al . [ 78 ] suggested the presence of two addi - tional P - Rex1 isoforms ; however , despite bioinformatics predictions , the expression of these variants needs to be con ﬁ rmed . The P - Rex1 protein is 1659 amino acids long ( Mw = 185 kDa ) and contains a tan - dem DH ( Dbl - homology ) / PH ( pleckstrin - homology ) domain charac - teristic of Rho GEFs , two DEP ( Disheveled , EGL - 10 , Pleckstrin ) domains , two PDZ domains , and a C - terminal region with signi ﬁ cant homology to inositol polyphosphate 4 - phosphatase ( IP4P ) [ 27 ] . Through a panel of P - Rex - 1 point mutations , deletions and trunca - tions , the catalytic DH domain was initially found to mediate the G βγ - dependent stimulation of GEF activity . Additionally , activation by PIP3 occurs via the PH domain of P - Rex1 . A second putative bind - ing site for PIP3 in P - Rex1 has been postulated , but its position has yet to be determined [ 118 ] . The DEP and PDZ domains are protein – protein interaction mod - ules present in many signaling proteins . These domains seem to be required for G βγ stimulation of P - Rex1 , and deletion of these do - mains reduces the maximal activation by G βγ subunits without af - fecting activation by PIP3 [ 118 ] . P - Rex1 interacts with mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) through the DEP domain , a mechanism that possibly integrates nutrient and growth factor signals . P - Rex1 can be activated through the mTOR complex 2 ( mTORC2 ) to promote Rac activation and cell migration [ 119 ] . Inositol polyphosphate 4 - phosphatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the 4 ′ - dephosphorylation in phosphatidylinositols [ 120 ] . Even though key residues required for phosphatase activity of the IP4P domain are present both in P - Rex1 and P - Rex2a [ 27 ] , the phosphatase activity has not been formally demonstrated in these proteins . This domain does not appear to be necessary for GEF activation [ 118 ] , although the intra - molecular interaction of the second DEP / ﬁ rst PDZ with the IP4P domain could be required for G βγ - induced activation of P - Rex1 . Moreover , PKA phosphorylation would prevent this domain – domain interaction , hence impeding G βγ - dependent activation [ 121 ] . Recent studies by Tu and coworkers [ 122 ] established that expres - sion of the P - Rex1 gene is regulated by a Sp1 - HDAC complex . To de - termine the potential involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of P - Rex1 expression , 22Rv1 non - metastatic prostate can - cer cells were treated with either a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor ( 5 - Aza - dC ) or a histone deacetylase inhibitor ( TSA ) . It was observed that histone deacetylation , but not DNA methylation , is involved in the suppression of P - Rex1 expression . HDAC inhibitors signi ﬁ cantly increased levels of acetylated histone H4 associated with the P - Rex1 promoter in 22Rv1 cells and markedly increased P - Rex1 gene expres - sion , without effects on the total amount of acetylated H4 compared to PC - 3 metastatic cells . These results suggest that up - regulation of P - Rex1 in metastatic cells could be due to region - speci ﬁ c changes in histone acetylation within the P - Rex1 promoter rather than a global histone acetylation increase . The promoter region that regulates both basal and TSA - induced P - Rex1 expression has been identi ﬁ ed . It contains a Sp1 binding site and may act as a regulatory cis element of P - Rex1 gene transcription . Indeed , ectopic overexpression of Sp1 signi ﬁ cantly increased P - Rex1 promoter activity [ 122 ] . Sp1 is pro - posed to act as a docking site for HDACs , enabling them to suppress gene transcription via modulation of the chromatin structure . Disso - ciation of HDACs from Sp1 on the P - Rex1 promoter may contribute to the aberrant up - regulation of P - Rex1 in some cancer types . ThehumanPREX2geneliesonchromosome8 ( 8q13 . 2 ) andencodes two isoforms ( P - Rex2a and PRex2b ) . P - Rex2a ( Mw = 183 kDa ) has strong sequence identity with P - Rex1 ( 59 % identical ) and a similar do - main architecture . On the other hand , P - Rex2b ( Mw = 112 kDa ) con - tains a much shorter C - terminus and lacks the IP4P domain . P - Rex2a is expressed in several tissues including heart , skeletal muscle , small in - testine and placenta , whereas P - Rex2b expression was originally 358 E . Wertheimer et al . / Cellular Signalling 24 ( 2012 ) 353 – 362 detected in the heart [ 111 ] . More recently , P - Rex2 was found in brain and lung , and atlow levels in liver , thymus and spleen [ 123 ] . In vascular endothelial cells , P - Rex2b mediates direct Rac1 activation and cell mi - gration in response to sphingosine - 1 - phosphate [ 124 ] . Unlike P - Rex1 , P - Rex2 isoforms are not expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes [ 111 , 112 ] . 6 . 3 . Functions of P - Rex1 and P - Rex2 P - Rex1 , the ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed member of the family , was originally puri ﬁ ed from neutrophils and found to have a fundamental role in the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) by NADPH oxidase , an enzymatic complex that requires Rac for activation [ 27 ] . Neutro - phils from P - Rex1 − / − mice display impaired GPCR - dependent acti - vation of Rac2 , ROS formation and motility , and have a defect in N - formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) - induced F - actin formation and superoxide production [ 125 , 126 ] . Remarkably , whereas P - Rex1 de ﬁ ciency does not signi ﬁ cantly affect Rac1 activation in mouse neutrophils , it impairs Rac2 activation in response to fMLP , possibly due to a higher af ﬁ nity of P - Rex1 for Rac2 than for Rac1 . This conclusion has been further supported by the fact that P - Rex1 - and Rac2 - de ﬁ cient neutrophils have similar phenotypes [ 17 , 127 – 129 ] . P - Rex1 is also a major regulator of Rac1 activation and chemotaxis in macrophages [ 130 ] . Additionally , P - Rex1 has been implicated in neuronal migration , neurite differentiation , and cerebellar long - term potentiation [ 131 – 133 ] . A role for P - Rex1 in angiogenesis has been recently established [ 134 ] . P - Rex2 de ﬁ cient mice are viable , fertile and apparently healthy with some reduction in body weight . However , these mice have abnormal Purkinje cell dendrite morphology and develop a mild motor coordina - tiondisorder [ 123 ] . The stimuli and receptorsthat linkP - Rex2toRacac - tivation in Purkinje cells remain to be determined . 6 . 4 . P - Rex1 is overexpressed in breast cancer The hyperactivation of ErbB receptor signaling is a hallmark of breast cancer . Overexpression of ErbB2 and / or ErbB ligands such as TGF - α or HRG is a common feature of breast cancer and leads to uncon - trolled growth and transformation [ 135 – 137 ] . Gain - of - function muta - tions of ErbB effectors such as PI3K or PTEN deletions have been also associated with breast cancer progression [ 138 , 139 ] . The established role of Rac1 as a mediator of ErbB signaling prompted several laborato - ries to search for relevant Rac - GEFs implicated in this pathway . To ad - dress this issue , our laboratory designed a “ Rac - GEF array ” to determine the relative expression of Rac - GEFs in breast cancer cells , and found that P - Rex1 is highly expressed in MCF - 7 and T - 47D cells , which derive from ER - positive luminal breast tumors . In contrast , non - transformed MCF - 10A cells have negligible P - Rex1 expression ( Fig . 3A ) . Basal breast cancer - derived cell lines such as MDA - MB - 231 cells do not express P - Rex1 . An extensive analysis of human breast can - cer specimens revealed that N 50 % of tumors stain positive for P - Rex1 ( Fig . 3B ) , whereas no staining is observed in normal mammary tissue . P - Rex1 is expressed only in the tumor cells but not in the stroma . P - Rex1 expression is higher in primary tumors from patients that under - went metastasis relative to those that did not , and 67 % of lymph nodes from breast cancer patients are P - Rex1 positive , suggesting a potential involvement of this Rac - GEF in metastatic dissemination of breast can - cer cells . Strikingly , there is a marked difference in expression among breast cancer subtypes , since P - Rex1is primarilyelevated inluminaltu - mors but essentially undetected in basal - type tumors [ 77 ] . The PREX1 locus is located in a region commonly ampli ﬁ ed in breast tumors and cell lines [ 140 – 143 ] . The PREX1 gene is ampli ﬁ ed in some breast cancer cell lines , such as MCF - 7 BT - 474 , and HCC1419 cells , but not in T - 47D cells [ 25 ] , suggesting that mecha - nisms other than gene ampli ﬁ cation may contribute , at least in part , to the overexpression of P - Rex1 in human breast tumors . An interest - ing observation is that P - Rex1 expression positively correlates with ER and ErbB2 expression . However , there is no correlation with PI3K mutations in the tumors . Notably , P - Rex1 depletion abolishes the tumorigenic activity of ErbB2 positive cells in nude mice [ 77 ] . 6 . 5 . P - Rex1 integrates ErbB receptor and CXCR4 signals in breast cancer cells As mentioned above , P - Rex1 is a PI3K - and G γβ - dependent Rac - GEF ( see Fig . 1 ) . Activation of Rac1 by HRG in breast cancer cells is sensitive both to PI3K γ inhibition and pertussis toxin . This surprising result strongly argued for the requirement of a Gi - coupled receptor in the activation of Rac1 by HRG . Moreover , ErbB receptor - mediated ac - tivation of Rac1 and migration were markedly reduced by inhibition / depletion of the G βγ subunit - regulated PI3K γ [ 77 ] . CXCR4 is a Gi - coupled receptor for the chemokine SDF - 1 α / CXCL12 . Both SDF - 1 α and its receptor have been widely implicated in the pro - gression of breast cancer , particularly in metastatic dissemination . Moreover , there is a positive correlation between CXCR4 and ErbB2 ex - pression in human breast tumors [ 144 – 146 ] . Our laboratory reported a strikingfunctionalassociationbetweenCXCR4andErbBreceptorsforP - Rex1 activation [ 77 ] . CXCR4 becomes activated in response to ErbB li - gands independently of SDF - 1 α and is required for P - Rex1 / Rac1 activa - tion and migration induced by HRG . EGFR is also required for the activation of CXCR4 by HRG , arguing for a model of transactivation of CXCR4 that involves multiple ErbB receptors . If PI3K γ or G βγ function is impaired , then activation ofRac1bySDF - 1 α is fully abolished , where - asRac1activation by HRG is only partially reduced . Mostprobably , ErbB receptors signal to P - Rex1 through two cooperative mechanisms : one via transactivation of a CXCR4 / G βγ / PI3K γ - dependent pathway , and Fig . 3 . Overexpression of P - Rex1 in breast cancer . Panel A . Expression of P - Rex1 mRNA by Q - PCR in human mammary cell lines . Values presented as “ fold - increase ” are rela - tive to levels in MCF - 10A cells . Panel B . Immunohistochemistry comparing P - Rex1 staining in a human breast tumor and normal mammary tissue . 359 E . Wertheimer et al . / Cellular Signalling 24 ( 2012 ) 353 – 362 the other by direct activation of type IA PI3K by ErbB receptors [ 77 ] . It would be of great interest to determine if other tyrosine - kinase recep - tors relevant in breast cancer , such as insulin - like growth factor recep - tor - 1R ( IGF - 1R ) , Met or Ret signal via P - Rex1 using similar or distinct mechanisms . Similarly to the previously described work , a subsequent study reported the involvement of P - Rex1 in HRG - induced Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells [ 78 ] . In addition to the effect of P - Rex1 on migra - tion and invasiveness of breast cancer cells and its requirement in vivo for breast cancer cell tumorigenicity , this study demonstrated that treating breast cancer cells with HRG alters P - Rex1 phosphorylation status . Indeed , HRG promotes the dephosphorylation of Ser313 and Ser319 and phosphorylation of Ser605 and Ser1169 in P - Rex1 . Phos - phorylation in Ser313 and Ser319 may therefore restrain Rac1 activity , whereas phosphorylationinSer605and Ser1169 mayfacilitate Rac1ac - tivation [ 78 ] . 6 . 6 . Role of P - Rex1 in breast cancer cell motility An extensive functional analysis using P - Rex1 overexpressingbreast cancer cell lines established the requirementof this GEF for Rac1 activa - tion and cell migration induced by EGF , TGF α or HRG . Interestingly , si - lencing other GEFs , including Vav2 , Vav3 or Tiam1 , does not signi ﬁ cantly affect Rac1 activation by HRG in T - 47D cells . Most notably , P - Rex1 depletion essentially abolishes Rac1 activation and motility in ErbB2 positive cell lines such as BT - 474 , HCC1419 and MDA - MB - 361 cells [ 77 ] . Subcellular localization analysis revealed that P - Rex1 translocates to the plasma membrane in response to HRG in a PI3K γ - dependent manner [ 77 ] . The DH – PH domain is necessary and suf ﬁ cient for trans - location . There is a noticeable intracellular redistribution of P - Rex1 to membrane ruf ﬂ es by HRG treatment . Moreover , P - Rex1 - de ﬁ cient T - 47D cells fail to form membrane ruf ﬂ es in response to HRG , strongly arguing for a role of the P - Rex1 / Rac1 axis in actin cytoskeleton reor - ganization in response to ErbB3 receptor stimulation . 6 . 7 . P - Rex2 and breast cancer The PREX2 gene is located in a chromosomal region that has been linked to aggressive cancer and metastatic progression and is fre - quently ampli ﬁ ed in breast and prostate cancers [ 147 , 148 ] . Interest - ingly , analysis of a breast tumor dataset annotated for PI3K pathway alterations revealed a positive association between P - Rex2a and PTEN expression . Moreover , PTEN - expressing breast tumors display a signi ﬁ cant positive association between increased P - Rex2a levels and activating mutations in PI3K [ 110 ] . The loss of PTEN has been linked to elevated Akt activity , cell surviv - al , cell cycle progression and growth . Parsons and coworkers found that P - Rex2a interacts with PTEN and inhibits its lipid phosphatase activity , thereby antagonizing the tumor suppressor function of PTEN in breast cancercells [ 110 ] . TheseeffectsdependontheP - Rex2aDH – PHdomains and are independent of the GEF activity . Overexpression of P - Rex2a or its DH – PH domains in the MCF - 10A cells , which expresses endogenous PTEN , increases Akt phosphorylation in Ser473 and proliferation . The single - acinar cell clusters that MCF - 10A cells form in 3D Matrigel cul - tures are transformed to multiacinar epithelial structures upon expres - sion of P - Rex2a . Moreover , co - expression of P - Rex2a and a constitutively active PI3K mutant leads to the formation of large branched , highly dysmorphic invasive structures . Expression of P - Rex2a in MCF - 10A cells increases by 3 - fold the number of colonies in soft agar formed by constitutively active PI3K . Furthermore , depletion of P - Rex2a from MCF - 7 breast cancer cells that express wild - type PTEN and a constitutively active PI3K reduces phospho - Akt levels and impairs proliferation . On the other hand , these effects are not observed in BT - 549 , a PTEN - de ﬁ cient cell line . Thus , the impact of P - Rex2a on the PI3K pathway and proliferation in breast cancer cells depend on the presence of a functional PTEN [ 110 ] . It became clear that P - Rex1 and P - Rex2 isoforms have differential effects on the PI3K / Akt pathway in breast cancer cells , since P - Rex1 RNAi depletion does not affect Akt1 ac - tivation [ 77 ] , and therefore eachP - Rexisoformmaycontribute indiffer - ent ways to breast cancer progression . A recent report described Akt1 - dependent effects of P - Rex1 in ovarian cancer cells [ 149 ] , suggesting cell type - speci ﬁ c differences in P - Rex1 regulation . Even though PTEN regulation by P - Rex2a appears to be unrelated to Rac activation [ 110 ] , additional studies are required to unambiguously establish the inde - pendence from Rac as well as to determine potential positive feedback loops that could be regulating P - Rex2a effects on the activity of PTEN . 7 . Concluding remarks : targeting the Rac pathway as an approach for breast cancer treatment ? Rac GTPasesfunction as tightly regulated signaling nodes that medi - ate inputs from receptors and oncogenes . The aberrant expression and / or activity of Rac regulators , particularly Rac - GEFs , offer a number of possibilities for targeting the Rac pathway . Based on current structural - function information on the interaction of Rac with GEFs it has been possible to identify small molecules that ﬁ t in the surface groove of Rac1 which determines GEF speci ﬁ cation . One good example is the compound NSC23766 described above , a highly soluble and per - meable inhibitor that prevents GTP loading onto Rac1 by Tiam1 and Trio [ 25 ] . This approach can be optimized to identify speci ﬁ c inhibitors for GEFs overexpressed in different cancer types , such as P - Rex1 in breast cancer . The rational design of compounds that target those GEFs with narrow tissue distribution should lead to drugs with limited off - target effects compared to traditional chemotherapeutic agents . Conceivably , it should be possible to design drugs that activate Rac - GAPs and counterbalance Rac hyperactivation in cancer , but such ap - proach still requires a deeper understanding of the contributions of GAPs to cancer progression . The discovery of P - Rex1 as a key factor in the progression of breast cancer has enormous implications from both prognostic and therapeu - tic standpoints . It is possible that P - Rex1 overexpression represents a biomarker for luminal breast cancer that predicts aggressiveness and metastasis . P - Rex1 is an effector of the ErbB network and therefore drugs that inhibit P - Rex1 may lead to the inactivation of ErbB receptor responses . This may have important implications for patients with ErbB2 positive breast tumors . As Rac1 and its downstream effectors have been implicated in antiestrogen resistance , it is possible that tar - geting the P - Rex1 / Rac1 / Pak1 pathway may also overcome the resis - tance of breast cancer cells to antiestrogens . Ultimately , deciphering the mechanistic insights that lead to P - Rex1 up - regulation and the sig - nals that drive P - Rex1 / Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms of mammary cell trans - formation and resistance to therapeutic agents .
