In the context of a push for improved reproducibility and benchmarking , this question is important to develop new tools for model comparison . This document summarizes a simple survey about experi - mental procedures , sent to authors of published papers at two leading conferences , NeurIPS 2019 and ICLR 2020 . It gives a simple picture of how hyper - parameters are set , how many baselines and datasets are included , or how seeds are used . 1 . Introduction Experiments play an increasing role in machine learning research . The prototypical experi - mental paradigm is to measure the generalization error of a model on a benchmark dataset , and , often , to compare it to baseline models . Yet , trustworthy experimentation is diﬃcult : thorough benchmarking has shown that classic baselines outperform later work initially re - ported as improvement for knowledge base completion ( Kadlec et al . , 2017 ) , neural language models ( Melis et al . , 2018 ) , or generative adversarial networks ( Lucic et al . , 2018 ) . Empirical results are aﬀected by arbitrary factors such as the random seeds of neural - network ﬁtting procedures ( Bouthillier et al . , 2019 ) or non - deterministic benchmarking environments in reinforcement learning ( Henderson et al . , 2018 ) . Computational budget matters for a fair comparison ( Lucic et al . , 2018 ; Melis et al . , 2018 ) , in particular for selection of model hyperparameter ( Dodge et al . , 2019 ) . The growing recognition of these challenges in machine learning research has motivated research in better procedures for experimentation and benchmarking : better hyperparam - eter tuning ( Bergstra and Bengio , 2012 ; Hansen , 2006 ; Hutter et al . , 2018 ; Li et al . , 2018 ; Snoek et al . , 2012 ) , controlled statistical testing of model performance ( Bouckaert and Frank , 2004 ; Demˇsar , 2006 ; Dietterich , 1998 ; Hothorn et al . , 2005 ) . To reach best the community , ideally these developments should ﬁt as well as possible the current practices . Here , we present a survey of experimental procedures currently used by practitioners at two of the leading conferences , NeurIPS2019 and ICLR2020 . The survey was conducted by Bouthillier and Varoquaux asking simple anonymous questions to the corresponding authors of the papers published at these venues . We detail the results of the survey and provide a light analysis 1 . Highlights A vast majority of empirical works optimize model hyper - parameters , thought almost half of these use manual tuning and most of the automatic hyper - parameter opti - mization is done with grid search . The typical number of hyper - parameter set is in interval 3 - 5 , and less than 50 model ﬁts are used to explore the search space . In addition , most works also optimized their baselines ( typically , around 4 baselines ) . Finally , studies typically reported 4 results per model per task to provide a measure of variance . 2 . Survey methodology The objective of the survey is to provide a portrait of the current common practices for experimental design in the machine learning community . We selected papers at the peer - reviewed conferences NeurIPS 2019 and ICLR 2020 as a representative sample of practices considered valid by the reviewers . We modeled our questions to capture benchmarking methods , the predominant exper - imental procedure to measure the performance of a new algorithm . The survey is limited to 10 short and simple questions , all multiple choices . This was important to favor high response rates from the researchers , and should provide valuable information nevertheless considering the lack of documentation on the topic . The survey was also anonymous to favor high response rates . First question serves as a ﬁlter of empirical and theoretical papers , second one as a ﬁlter for questions on hyperparameter optimization . The third , fourth and ﬁfth questions measure the popularity of methods as well as the search space in terms of dimensionality and exploration . Sixth question measures comparability of models in benchmarks , while seventh and eight ones measure the number of comparisons and variety of benchmarks . Finally ninth question quantiﬁes sample size upon which conclusions are made and tenth question measures reproducibility of the papers with sample size 1 . For NeurIPS , all author names , paper title and PDF were collected from the pre - proceeding webpage 2 . The emails were then automatically collected from the PDFs , with manual intervention when required . For ICLR , all author names , paper title and emails were collected using the oﬃcial OpenReview library 3 . The survey for NeurIPS was sent on Thursday , 12th December , during the conference . A second email to remind authors about the survey was sent on Wednesday , 18th December . The response rate promptly raised from 30 % to 34 % after the reminder . The survey for ICLR was sent on Monday , 23th December , 4 days after the paper decision notiﬁcations . Considering the high response rate , no second email was sent to remind authors of ICLR . 3 . Results The questionnaire was sent to all ﬁrst authors or corresponding authors of the accepted papers at NeurIPS2019 and ICLR2020 . The response rates were 35 . 6 % (cid:0) 4521269 (cid:1) and 48 . 6 % 1 .

Discussion 4 . 1 Analysis We ﬁrst note the results are similar for NeurIPS and ICLR across all questions . One of the few signiﬁcant diﬀerences being the larger proportion of theoretical papers at NeurIPS with approximately 10 % more . 4 Survey of ML experimental methods at NeurIPS2019 and ICLR2020 Hyper - parameter tuning The most popular tuning approach is manually , but followed closely by grid search ( a 1 . 6 % diﬀerence between the two approaches at NeurIPS and 8 . 5 % at ICLR ) . Together they account for more than 85 % hyperparameter procedures in both con - ferences . The number of hyperparameters is mostly in the interval 3 to 5 . The proportions are preserved if we look speciﬁcally at the answers of papers using grid search . Figure 1 : Results of question 4 ) , number of hyperparam - eters optimized . All answers on the left , grid search only on the right . NeurIPS ICLR 0 25 50 75 100 % 60 309 34 283 69 Not applicable 5 + hyperparameters 3 - 5 hyperparameters 66 2 hyperparameters 1 hyperparameter 128 125 51 58 1 0 All results NeurIPS ICLR 0 25 50 75 100 % 33 151 20 138 29 5 + hyperparameters 3 - 5 hyperparameters 30 2 hyperparameters 1 hyperparameter 68 61 21 27 Only grid search In more than 50 % of the papers , the hyperparameter search was executed on less than 50 trials . Again , the proportions are preserved if we look speciﬁcally at the answers of papers using grid search . Figure 2 : Results of question 5 ) , number of trials in to - tal during hyper - parameter optimization . All answers on the left , grid search only on the right . NeurIPS ICLR 0 25 50 75 100 % 203 309 184 283 60 Not applicable 500 + trials 200 - 500 trials 100 - 200 trials 53 50 - 100 trials 1 - 50 trials 27 16 8 15 10 15 1 0 All results NeurIPS ICLR 0 25 50 75 100 % 80 151 71 138 42 500 + trials 200 - 500 trials 100 - 200 trials 38 50 - 100 trials 1 - 50 trials 16 10 6 11 7 8 Only grid search We now focus on grid search results because it is possible to infer the number of diﬀerent values for each hyperparameters which were evaluated in the papers . Using the lower bound of the number of hyperparameters ( n h ) and upper bound of number of trials ( n t ) reported in the survey , we can estimate an upper bound on the number of diﬀerent values ( n v ) evaluated in the corresponding papers with exp (cid:16) log n t n h (cid:17) , given that using grid search produces the number of trials n t = n n h v . We illustrate these results in Figure 3 . For more than 50 % of the papers in which grid search was used , 6 or less diﬀerent values were evaluated . It is important to understand that this is an upper bound , computed using n h = 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 for answers 1 , 2 , 3 – 5 and 5 + to question 4 ) and n t = 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 for answers to question 4 ) . The true average number of values used must therefore be lower . As an example , changing only n h from 3 to 4 for answer 3 – 5 reduces the red bar of 50 % to 4 values or less . This low number of points reveals the importance of the selection of the grid . As shown by Bergstra and Bengio ( 2012 ) , grid search’s performance is ensured only if the region of optimal hyperparameters is large with respect to the grid’s granularity . As such , in order to ensure performance of a coarse grid search of 6 values , it would require either that the hyperparameters are optimal on a wide region , or that the prior knowledge of experimenter made it possible to design a coarse grid precisely positioned on region of optimality . In either case , hyperparameter optimization could be considered rather pointless . Considering the 5 Bouthillier and Varoquaux accumulating evidence suggesting the opposite ( Lucic et al . , 2018 ; Melis et al . , 2018 ; Dodge et al . , 2019 ) , we instead speculate that the present statistics suggest under - performing hyperparameter optimization procedures . This represents more than 20 % of the empirical papers for NeurIPS and 19 % for ICLR . 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Number of papers 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 14 32 50 100 1000 N u m b e r o f v a l u e s p e r d i m e n s i on 50 % 11 % 3 % 15 % 18 % 7 % 14 % 3 % 5 % 1 % 1 % 20 % 1 % 1 % 0 10 20 30 40 50 Number of papers 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 14 22 50 50 % 14 % 6 % 17 % 16 % 4 % 17 % 4 % 6 % 1 % 1 % 14 % Figure 3 : Number of diﬀerent values for each hyperparameter One shortcoming of the survey is the lack of information on the type of model used . Consequently , we cannot know if these numbers applies similarly to models that are com - putationally cheap or expensive . We would expect however that large neural networks are still more popular at ICLR than NeurIPS based on the history of these conferences . We thus believe the relative similarity of the results between the conferences to be an indica - tion that the proportions reported here would apply to both papers on cheap and expensive algorithms . Baselines The majority of authors of empirical papers reported optimizing their base - lines’ hyperparameters . This strikes us as against our personal knowledge of recent machine learning literature . Our hypothesis is that many authors answered ’Yes’ for reporting results of other papers in which the hyperparameters were optimized . This would be technically true and the question should have been formulated diﬀerently to avoid this possible confu - sion . The goal of this question was to measure to which extend baselines are comparable , that is , using the same experiment design as the contributed algorithm . Both the number of baselines and datasets most importantly falls in the 3 to 5 interval . We expected these numbers to be lower and suspect that it may a be bias caused by the reviewing process of the conferences we selected . Statistical power The most common number of reported results per model are between 1 and 5 inclusively , 26 % and 37 % of which falls in the interval ( 3 , 5 ) for NeurIPS and ICLR respectively while 26 % and 25 % reported 1 result . About half of the papers with only one result per model were seeded . Statistical tests are rarely used in recent machine learning literature , nevertheless we believe it is insightful to consider what statistical power or what size eﬀect could be detected with the sample sizes reported in this survey . 6 Survey of ML experimental methods at NeurIPS2019 and ICLR2020 Using Neyman - Person approach for statistical testing and controlling for both error type I and error type II at 0 . 05 , we can compute the minimal diﬀerence of performance that can be detected between two algorithms . For simplicity , lets consider a classiﬁcation task in which a model have 90 % accuracy on a test set of 10k samples . We can estimate the variance of the performance measure due the sampling of the test set by assuming the measure follows a binomial distribution 4 . For a sample size of 1 , the minimal diﬀerence is about 1 % accuracy , while it is 0 . 45 % for sample size 5 , and 0 . 31 % for sample size 10 . As 50 % of sample sizes reported in the survey are below 6 , the community should be concerned of benchmarks where many algorithms compared have similar performances , and make sure a suﬃcient sample size is used . Opening questions on hyperparameter optimization Most studies use grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization . This lack of diversity raises the ques - tion of why more sophisticated hyperparameter optimization methods are not used . Are researchers lacking trust in these more sophisticated methods ? Are they lacking computa - tional power and therefore favor manual procedures ? Are the available codebases considered to complicated to use ? 4 . 2 Shortcomings of the survey Sampling bias All samples have an inherent bias . For this survey , the bias comes both from the population targeted – papers selected at two of the leading conferences , NeurIPS2019 and ICLR2020 – , has well as self - selection bias in the responses : respectively 35 . 6 % and 48 . 6 % of researcher surveyed replied . This bias may result in sampling more researchers sensitive to the question of experimental design . As such , the bias could be considered towards better practices , implying that actual practices could be slightly less systematic then our results imply . The survey was anonymous which made it impossi - ble to limit number of answers per paper . Consequently , unmeasured duplicate answers could also have contributed to a bias . Comparison of our results with the statistics of the reproducibility checklist at NeurIPS could serve as an estimate of these biases . Choice of questions Results of the survey are aggregated over all empirical papers . The implications of methodologies vary signiﬁcantly however for diﬀerent type of tasks or diﬀerent kind of models . We failed to include a question which would allow such dichotomy in the analysis . We will discuss this further in next section . As we were collecting the answers of the survey , researchers reported some confusion on several questions . Question 2 ) Many papers were not using benchmarks but rather ablation studies as their experimental paradigm . We intended questions 2 - 5 as measures of the exploration of the hyperparameter space and its eﬀect beyond simple optimization . Nevertheless , some authors reported answering not applicable when using ablation studies . An optional textual answer for not applicable would have been very informative . Question 4 ) There was an overlap between the intervals ( 1 , 50 ) , ( 50 , 100 ) , ( 100 , 200 ) and ( 200 - 500 ) . 4 . Which is approximately valid unless performance is very close to 100 % 7 Bouthillier and Varoquaux Question 6 ) As reported by one of the respondent , the question did not ask speciﬁcally about using the same hyperparameter optimization procedure . This likely confused many authors leading them to answer yes if their baselines where optimized results from other papers . Question 7 ) Some authors told us they answered not applicable because they were the ﬁrst to tackle a new problem . There is generally a straw man solution that can be used as a baseline in such situation and failing to compare with it should have been considered as 0 baseline instead of not applicable . There was however no option ’0’ in the multiple choices . Question 8 ) There was an overlap between intervals ( 3 , 5 ) and ( 5 , 10 ) . Question 9 ) There was an overlap between intervals ( 3 , 5 ) and ( 5 , 10 ) . Question 9 - 10 ) Based on the feedback received and textual answers , questions 9 ) and 10 ) were often mis - understood as seeding of model initialization in particular . The question was rather about seeding of any possible source of variation in the experi - ments . As a result , several authors reported to us answering not applicable because model initialisation was not a source of variation in their experiments . Additionally , the question did not ask speciﬁcally per model per task . This could have led some authors to answer number of results reported over all tasks , therefore introducing a bias upwards . Despite these limitations , we believe current trends can be identiﬁed as we highlighted on the experimentation methodology of researchers in machine learning . Some diﬀerences are indeed large enough to be considered signiﬁcant . 5 . Conclusions For reproducibility and AutoML , there is active research in benchmarking and hyperpa - rameter procedures in machine learning . We hope that the survey results presented here can help inform this research . As this document is merely a research report , we purposely limited interpretation of the results and drawing recommendations . However , trends that stand out to our eyes are , 1 ) the simplicity of hyper - parameter tuning strategies ( mostly manual search and grid search ) , 2 ) the small number of model ﬁts explored during this tuning ( often 50 or less ) , which biases the results and 3 ) the small number of performances reported , which limits statistical power . These practices are most likely due to the high computational cost of ﬁtting modern machine - learning models .

We received more textual answers than the ones reported here , but we only considered those of empirical papers for which authors answered ’1’ to question 9 ) . Hence , we ignored the others . There is only 7 textual answers out of the 100 and 91 answers for question 10 ) . The goal of question 10 ) was to measure to which extend papers with single results per model were reproducible . If an answer does not ﬁt the typical Same seed but satisﬁes reproducibility , we categorize it as Same seed . Otherwise we categorize it as Diﬀerent seeds or non seeded . The rationale for each decisions are described below . I reported average score for each model , averaged over 10 runs . Each of the 10 runs used the same seed across all models . Category : Same seed Rationale : The average estimation was seeded and thus reproducible . Same seed , but estimated the variance in previous works to be small . Category : Same seed Rationale : Used the same seed . not applicable . there’s no seed because we use pre - trained models Category : Same seed Rationale : Reusing the same pre - trained model has the same eﬀect as using the same seed to train a model . Seeded the data examples , did not seed the simulations ( where however enough Monte Carlo replicates were conducted to make noise negligible ) Category : Same seed Rationale : Assuming the noise due to simulation was indeed negligible enough , we assume seeding the sampling of data samples is enough to make the experiments reproducible . 10 Survey of ML experimental methods at NeurIPS2019 and ICLR2020 Our paper did not involve training deep networks , and there were not any mys - terious hyperparameters . . . . Category : Same seed Rationale : Because the algorithm was apparently fully deterministic in a deterministic environment . Checked that results were consistent with diﬀerent seeds but no proper study of variance Category : Diﬀerent seeds or non seeded Rationale : Because diﬀerent seeds were evaluated but results for only one of them was reported . Choice of seed has no eﬀect on training outcome Category : Same seed Rationale : Assuming the authors are right and seeding has negligible eﬀect in their ex - periments . 11
