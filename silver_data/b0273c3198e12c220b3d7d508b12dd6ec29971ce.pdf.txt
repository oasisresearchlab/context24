In particular the importance of histidine 73 ( H73 ) 17 methylation of ùõΩ - actin remains unclear . Here , we employed molecular dynamics simulations 18 using an advanced method that couples a polarizable force Ô¨Åeld to large scale adaptive sampling 19 to achieve higher level of interatomic interaction accuracy when compared to classical atomic 20 force Ô¨Åelds . This methodology enabled us to investigate the effect of H73 methylation on the 21 plasticity of both ùõΩ - actin monomers ( G - actin ) and Ô¨Ålaments ( F - actin ) and capture how subtle 22 conformational changes are relevant to ùõΩ - actin function . We uncovered that H73 methylation 23 enhances the opening of the nucleotide binding cleft and modiÔ¨Åes allosteric paths linking 24 subdomains 2 and 4 ( SD2 and SD4 ) of actin . We showed that in F - actin H73 methylation affects 25 the opening of a backdoor and limits the release of the inorganic phosphate , as conÔ¨Årmed by 26 biochemical assays . We also observed that effects of H73 methylation are modulated by the type 27 of nucleotide bound in the actin cavity and ions surrounding the protein . Taken together , these 28 results shed new light onto how H73 methylation regulates ùõΩ - actin plasticity and coordinates 29 impact of several key environmental factors . 30 31 Introduction 32 The actin cytoskeleton is involved in numerous cellular functions , such as cell shape maintenance , 33 proliferation , and migration Svitkina ( 2018 ) . Over many decades , studies using ùõº - actin , the main 34 actin isoform present in skeletal muscle tissue Perrin and Ervasti ( 2010 ) ; Varland et al . ( 2019 ) as 35 a model of choice , revealed that actin undergoes large conformational changes as it executes its 36 function Merino et al . ( 2020 ) . Thus , it is well established that actin monomers assemble to nucleate 37 and elongate Ô¨Ålaments Wegner ( 1982 ) , which form the basis of the cytoskeleton . Structurally , ad - 38 dition of actin monomers at Ô¨Ålament ends induces a transition from the globular actin monomer 39 ( G - actin ) to a Ô¨Çattened F - actin structure Oda et al . ( 2009 ) . In the Ô¨Ålament , the actin structural plastic - 40 1 of 21 ity is also important for its ATPase activity , which requires a high level of plasticity . Actin molecules 41 achieve this plasticity through movement of its four distinct subdomains ( SD1 - 4 ) that change rel - 42 ative orientations in response to nucleotide binding , ATP hydrolysis , and inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) 43 release Blanchoin and Pollard ( 2002 ) . These events , in turn , modulate the mechanical properties 44 of the Ô¨Ålament and interactions with many actin binding proteins Oosterheert et al . ( 2023 ) . 45 In addition to being modulated by ATP and ADP binding Merino et al . ( 2020 ) ; Varland et al . 46 ( 2019 ) ; Reynolds et al . ( 2022 ) , and ATP hydrolysis , actin plasticity also depends on other environ - 47 mental factors , such as the surrounding ions Kang et al . ( 2012 ) . Furthermore , recent work has high - 48 lighted the importance of the methylation of histidine 73 ( H73 ) in affecting Ô¨Ålament formation and 49 the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the monomeric form Wilkinson et al . ( 2019 ) . Although Ô¨Årst reported 50 more than six decades ago Johnson et al . ( 1967 ) , H73 methylation has remained a biochemical odd - 51 ity and continues to be somewhat of a functional mystery . Recent identiÔ¨Åcation of SETD3 as the 52 methyltransferase responsible for catalyzing this rare and rarely studied post - translational modi - 53 Ô¨Åcation Wilkinson et al . ( 2019 ) ; Kwiatkowski et al . ( 2018 ) has reignited interest in the role of H73 54 methylation in actin biology . Previous structural studies showed that H73 is located within a region 55 of actin known as sensor loop ( Fig 1 - A ) Graceffa and Dominguez ( 2003 ) . Given this location , and 56 the speciÔ¨Åc interactions methylated H73 makes with the nucleotide binding cleft located between 57 subdomains 2 and 4 ( SD2 and SD4 ; Fig 1 - A ) , this PTM was proposed to be a key regulator that 58 couples ATP hydrolysis and Pi release with Ô¨Ålament formation Nyman et al . ( 2002 ) . However , many 59 details of mechanism ( s ) that are governed by methylation of H73 in actin remain unknown . Addi - 60 tionally , the precise role of H73 methylation in actin dynamics and plasticity remains incompletely 61 understood . 62 Here , we address some of these mechanistic questions using ùõΩ - actin as a model system . We 63 chose to focus on ùõΩ - actin because it remains far less studied actin isoform , despite functional rel - 64 evance . Firstly , unlike ùõº - actin , which is only expressed in skeletal muscles , ùõΩ - actin is ubiquitously 65 expressed in all cells as a highly abundant housekeeping gene . Furthermore , ùõΩ - actin plays a key 66 role in early embryonic development , cell migration and growth Bunnell et al . ( 2011 ) . More re - 67 cently , ùõΩ - actin has been shown to participate in chromatin remodeling Mahmood et al . ( 2021 ) , and 68 there is accumulating evidence that ùõΩ - actin is important for epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition 69 Dugina et al . ( 2021 ) ; Nietmann et al . ( 2023 ) and of interest in cancer research Guo et al . ( 2013 ) . 70 However , ùõΩ - actin remains less studied than the ùõº isoform , especially in terms of its biochemical 71 mechanism and dynamics . This is primarily due to the fact that obtaining high - quality sample for 72 in vitro studies has been a major hurdle for the Ô¨Åeld , until very recently Ceron et al . ( 2022 ) ; Hatano 73 et al . ( 2020 ) . 74 Over the last two decades , MD simulations have become an increasingly popular strategy for 75 studying biological systems at different scales Vanommeslaeghe et al . ( 2010 ) ; Maier et al . ( 2015 ) ; 76 Souza et al . ( 2021 ) ; Kim and Hummer ( 2008 ) ; Chu and Voth ( 2005 ) . Notably , this methodology has 77 been extensively employed to delineate various properties of actin , such as structural differences 78 between nucleotide states Splettstoesser et al . ( 2009 ) ; Saunders et al . ( 2014 ) ; Jepsen and Sept 79 ( 2020 ) , the localization of water molecules in the actin binding site and their impact on protein 80 plasticity and enzymatic properties Saunders and Voth ( 2011 ) ; McCullagh et al . ( 2014 ) , interactions 81 with small molecules Rennebaum and CaÔ¨Çisch ( 2012 ) ; Helal et al . ( 2013 ) and the dynamic behavior 82 of Ô¨Ålaments in diverse environments Chu and Voth ( 2005 ) ; Splettstoesser et al . ( 2011 ) ; Zsolnay et al . 83 ( 2020 ) ; Schroer et al . ( 2020 ) ; Shamloo and Mehrafrooz ( 2018 ) ; Jaswandkar et al . ( 2021 ) ; Horan et al . 84 ( 2020 ) ; Castaneda et al . ( 2019 ) ; Oosterheert et al . ( 2023 ) . However , these computational studies 85 almost exclusively focused on ùõº - actin , while the ùõΩ - actin isoform remains understudied , limiting our 86 understanding of its unique dynamics and functional implications . 87 Even if MD simulations have been instrumental in the understanding of how ion and water 88 molecules interact with proteins Song et al . ( 2013 ) ; Kopec et al . ( 2018 ) ; Bellissent - Funel et al . ( 2016 ) ; 89 Hocky et al . ( 2016 ) the precise parametrization of these components is still challenging and de - 90 pends on the system studied Kadaoluwa Pathirannahalage et al . ( 2021 ) .

( 2015 ) ; El Khoury et al . ( 2022 ) . In addition , the use of enhanced sampling methods allows 95 exploring diverse unknown states hard to reach through the use of classical molecular dynamics 96 simulations Jaffrelot Inizan et al . ( 2021 ) ; Bowman et al . ( 2010 ) ; Miao et al . ( 2015 ) ; C√©lerse et al . 97 ( 2022 ) ; Ma et al . ( 2023 ) . 98 Here , we employed MD simulation strategies that overcome the limitations of classical ap - 99 proaches by combining adaptive sampling with the AMOEBA polarizable force Ô¨Åeld to more ac - 100 curately model interatomic interactions . We applied them to address outstanding challenges and 101 provide new insights into ùõΩ - actin biochemistry and how H73 methylation together with key envi - 102 ronmental factors ( ions and nucleotides ) , affect its dynamics and plasticity both in its core and 103 extremities . This work sheds new light onto the plasticity of the ùõΩ - actin isoform , where subtle 104 structural changes can impact actin function , from the monomer to the Ô¨Ålament . 105 Results 106 Histidine 73 methylation modulates the plasticity of ATP bound G - actin . We performed 1 . 52 107 ¬µs long adaptive sampling polarizable molecular dynamics simulations for both ùõº - and ùõΩ - actin iso - 108 forms containing ATP bound nucleotide and magnesium ion in the active site , in the presence of 109 150 mM of KCl in solution . To assess the effect of H73 methylation on the G - actin dynamics , we 110 simulated both non - methylated histidine ( HIS73 ) and methylated histidine ( HIC73 ) and measured 111 the dihedral angle formed by the four subdomains , as well as the distance between SD2 and SD4 112 which deÔ¨Ånes the size of the nucleotide binding cleft ( Saunders et al . , 2014 ) ( hereafter referred as 113 ‚Äúcleft‚Äù ) ( Fig . 1A ) . For HIS73 ùõΩ - actin , the protein Ô¨Çuctuated around a dihedral angle of c . a . - 20¬∞ and a 114 cleft size of 25 √Ö ( Fig . 1B ) . The region of high density extends up to 27 √Ö indicating the capacity of 115 the protein to widen the cleft during the course of the simulation ( Fig . S1 and Movie S1 ) . Remark - 116 3 of 21 Figure 2 . Role of methylation and magnesium ions on ATP - bound ùõΩ - actin intrinsic Ô¨Çexibility . A - Representation of main residues interactions at the interface of SD2 and SD4 . Interactions are colored in function of the normalized probability of hydrogen bonds between these residues during the simulations . B - Volume of the actin active for the most probable actin conÔ¨Ågurations presented in Figure 1 - B . C - Distribution of the active site volume for each system presented in ( B ) . D - Distribution of the distance between magnesium ion and ùõæ - phosphate . E - Histograms of the number of water molecules around the magnesium ( ‚â§ 5 √Ö ) in the active site . The differences for the cavity volume and distance between magnesium ion and ùõæ - phosphate observed between HIS73 , and HIC73 and HIC + Mg 2 + systems are signiÔ¨Åcant ( Table S3 ) . The number of water molecule is not signiÔ¨Åcantly different between these three systems ( Table S3 ) . ably , despite differing from HIS73 slightly ( presence of an additional - CH3 group ) , HIC73 induced 117 notable changes in the cleft dynamics , causing an expansion from 25 √Ö to 27 √Ö ( Fig . S1 and Movie 118 S2 ) , alongside a slight reduction in the dihedral angle to - 18¬∞ . To assess , which parts of the actin 119 were most affected , we performed Root Mean Square Fluctuations analysis ( RMSF ) ( see Methods ) 120 ( Fig . 1C ) . We observed that the D - loop and SD4 subdomain showed distinctive differences in their 121 RMSF proÔ¨Åle . More precisely , the dynamics of helices encompassing residues 200 - 206 ( H1 helix ) 122 and 228 - 232 ( H2 helix ) , positioned at opposite sides of SD4 , exhibited pronounced sensitivity to 123 histidine methylation ( Fig . 1D ) . Thus , taken together , this suggests that histidine 73 methylation 124 impacts not only the local dynamics around the histidine residue but also regions distal from this 125 site . Interestingly , although the sequence identity between ùõº - and ùõΩ - actin is very high ( ca 94 % ) , his - 126 tidine methylation seemed to affect differently the amplitude of the dihedral - cleft Ô¨Çuctuations for 127 ùõº or ùõΩ isoform ( Fig . S2 ) . The most affected areas in the ùõº - actin were comparable to the ones seen 128 in ùõΩ - actin ( Fig . S3 ) . Furthermore , both the dihedral angle and the size of the cleft were exhibited 129 a wider range of values in comparison to the ùõΩ - actin isoform . This implies that ùõΩ - actin undergoes 130 more subtle changes compared to the ùõº - actin isoform . These results highlight that slight mod - 131 iÔ¨Åcations in the amino acid sequence between actin isoforms can be translated into detectable 132 structural variations which may have impact on actin functions . For subsequent sections , we focus 133 on the ùõΩ - actin isoform , as limited information exists on the dynamics of this protein , despite of its 134 importance ( as introduced above ) . 135 136 Histidine 73 methylation opens the SD2 - SD4 cleft and affects the enzymatic site . Next , 137 we focused our analysis on dissecting speciÔ¨Åc structural perturbations in ATP - bound monomeric 138 4 of 21 Figure 3 . Main allosteric paths in ATP - bound ùõΩ - actin systems .

Most represented path in red , second most represented in blue , and third most represented in green . On right , licorice representations of these three main paths using the same color scheme . Residues on the sensor loop are highlighted . ùõΩ - actin caused by histidine 73 methylation . We observed that in the case of unmethylated HIS73 , 139 residues of SD4 H1 helix interacted with residues from the SD2 domain , effectively bridging the 140 two subdomains ( Fig . 2A , left panel ) . Notably , GLU207 of SD4 formed stable interactions with 141 residue ARG62 of SD2 . Given the charged nature of these residues , these interactions are likely 142 mediated via electrostatics . Additionally , based on the bond lengths and angles we measured , 143 hydrogen bonding may also play a role . Regardless of the exact nature of this interaction , when 144 we examined the same interactions in monomeric ùõΩ - actin where HIS73 was methylated ( HIC73 ) , 145 we noted that the likelihood of interaction between these amino acids was reduced ( Fig . 2A , cen - 146 tral panel ) , facilitating the opening of the cleft . This cleft opening was correlated with an increase 147 of the active site volume ( Fig . 2B - C ) from 685 √Ö3 to 760 √Ö3 . As this volume change may affect 148 molecules inside the active site , we scrutinized the dynamic properties of the magnesium ion and 149 water molecules around it . We observed two magnesium ion populations ( Fig . 2D ) : a Mg 2 + bound 150 to the ùõæ - phosphate , with a distance 2 . 2 √Ö between these two atoms , and an unbound Mg 2 + at a 151 distance of 4 √Ö from the ùõæ - phosphate . For HIC73 , the population of the Mg 2 + in the bound state de - 152 creased . Surprisingly , we did not observed signiÔ¨Åcant changes in the number of water molecules 153 in the active site ( Fig . 2E ) . Consequently , our results showed how the HIS73 methylation can affect 154 subdomain interactions and active site for ATP - bound ùõΩ - actin . 155 156 Histidine 73 methylation exerts allosteric effects to bridge SD2 and SD4 subdomains . His - 157 tidine 73 is situated at the core of the actin at the interface of all four subdomains ( Fig . 1A ) . However , 158 the mechanism through which the methylation of the residue inÔ¨Çuences distant regions , such as 159 helices H1 and H2 on SD4 , remains elusive . To elucidate this , we conducted correlation - based 160 dynamical network analysis Westerlund et al . ( 2020 ) ; Melo et al . ( 2020 ) . This analysis allows cal - 161 culations of dynamic networks where nodes represent the alpha - carbons of each residue and the 162 edges represent correlations of motions between nodes , and has been used to identify possible , 163 5 of 21 functionally relevant allosteric pathways Melo et al . ( 2020 ) . Using this approach we identiÔ¨Åed sev - 164 eral possible allosteric pathways between GLU207 and ARG62 , the two residues engaged in the 165 hydrogen bond that bridges SD2 and SD4 subdomains ( Fig . 2A , left panels ) . In unmethylated 166 monomeric ùõΩ - actin ( HIS73 ) , two most represented allosteric paths involved direct interactions be - 167 tween GLU207 and ARG62 ( Fig . 3A , left and central panels ; Table S2 ) , while the third path involved 168 additional residues located on both SD2 and SD4 ( Fig . 3A , right panel ) . Interestingly , the sensor 169 loop was directly involved in this path through PRO70 and GLU72 . Upon histidine methylation 170 ( HIC73 case ) , the direct interaction between GLU207 and ARG62 was lost , and replaced by inter - 171 actions among a larger number of residues on SD2 and SD4 subdomains ( Fig . 3B and Table S2 ) . 172 Notably , the sensor loop was involved in the two most representative paths , while the third one 173 displayed an SD2 - SD4 bridge mediated through interactions between TYR69 and ARG183 ( Fig . 3B , 174 right panel ) . Thus , change from HIS to HIC introduces measurable changes in allosteric network . 175 We also observed that the ARG183 residue was involved in the most represented allosteric path in 176 both HIS73 ùõΩ - actin and HIC73 ùõΩ - actin . To examine further whether a change in a single residue can 177 introduce changes in allosteric networks , we performed simulations of the ARG183GLY mutant for 178 HIC73 ùõΩ - actin . We noted that in the ARG183GLY ùõΩ - actin mutant the paths connecting SD2 and SD4 179 were redirected around the active site ( Fig . S7B - D ) , which is distinct from what we saw in HIC73 180 ùõΩ - actin , where they pass through the sensor loop . This rerouting was accompanied by a change 181 of the cleft - dihedral proÔ¨Åle ( Fig . S7A ) . Taken together , these Ô¨Åndings suggest that histidine 73 182 methylation promotes the opening of the cleft between SD2 and SD4 subdomains , which is other - 183 wise held in a more closed conformation by the GLU207 - ARG62 interaction . Histidine methylation , 184 which changes the local polar environment , also alters allosteric paths that mediated interactions 185 between SD2 and SD4 , by rerouting allosteric communications away from direct hydrogen bond - 186 ing between GLU207 and ARG62 and towards a more signiÔ¨Åcant involvement of the sensor loop . 187 188 Presence of magnesium ions modulates the impact of histidine 73 methylation Magne - 189 sium ion concentration plays an important role in actin polymerization Kang et al . ( 2012 ) . To exam - 190 ine whether histidine methylation is affected by magnesium ions we have performed simulations 191 on the monomeric HIC73 ùõΩ - actin using 75 mM of MgCl2 ( to directly compare with 150 mM KCl ) . 192 At this high Mg 2 + ion concentration , both cleft and dihedral angles were affected , displaying an in - 193 crease ( up to 30 √Ö in cleft opening , and up to - 30¬∞ dihedral angle , respectively ) ( Fig . 1B , right panel ) 194 in comparison to HIC73 system without magnesium ions . The RMSF ( Fig . 1C ) as well as the volume 195 of the ATP binding site were affected by the addition of magnesium ions . The latter displayed a 196 larger volume ( Fig . 2C ) , although the distribution of water molecules in the active site remained 197 unaffected ( Fig . 2E ) . Additionally , the population of magnesium ion not bound to the ùõæ - phosphate 198 slightly increased ( Fig . 2D ) . We also used a larger simulation box of c . a . 100 , 000 atoms ( see Table 199 S1 ) to simulate a system with a molar concentration of 7 . 5 mM MgCl2 ( corresponding to 5 Mg 2 + 200 ions ) , which is similar to the concentration used for in vitro actin polymerization assays Kang et al . 201 ( 2012 ) . At this Mg 2 + ion concentration , we also observed increases in both cleft and dihedral angles 202 ( Fig . S4 ) , albeit less pronounced than the one seen for 75 mM of MgCl2 . Attempting a concentra - 203 tion of 75 mM of MgCl2 for this larger system size , we observed even larger modulations of the 204 cleft - dihedral proÔ¨Åle ( Fig . S4 ) . Thus , monomeric actin Ô¨Çexibility is dependent of the magnesium ion 205 concentration . Magnesium ( as well as potassium ) ions were interacting on numerous sites spread 206 on different subdomains ( ASP56 , GLU93 , GLU99 , GLU100 , GLU270 , and GLU364 ; Fig . S5 ) . Lastly , we 207 examined how magnesium ions affect the allosteric paths between SD2 and SD4 in methylated G - 208 actin ( Fig . 3C ) . Interestingly , the most represented path was no longer passing through the sensor 209 loop , but on the opposite side of the active site . Hence , the addition of magnesium ions modulates 210 the effects of H73 methylation and rebalances allosteric pathways in a way that mirrors what we 211 observed in unmethylated G - actin . 212 ADP binding reduces the impact of histidine 73 methylation on actin dynamics To in - 213 vestigate whether the effects of HIS73 methylation are dependent on the nature of the bound 214 6 of 21 Figure 4 .

Pathways for HIS73 and HIC73 + Mg 2 + systems are presented in Figure S4 . Differences observed between HIS73 , HIC73 , and HIC + Mg 2 + systems are all signiÔ¨Åcant except for the the distance between magnesium ion and ùõæ - phosphate ( Table S3 ) . nucleotide , we performed additional simulations with ADP in the binding cavity , providing a basis 215 for comparison with ATP - bound actin . In the presence of ADP , the internal Ô¨Çexibility of the actin 216 monomer , particularly in the SD4 subdomain , was reduced for methylated H73 , as revealed by 217 the RMSF proÔ¨Åle ( Fig . 4A ) , although the dynamics of the H2 helix ( residues 228 - 232 ) still remained 218 enhanced . Additionally , when compared to ATP - bound state , ADP - binding led to decrease in the 219 cleft opening in HIC73 , and HIC73 with addition of Mg 2 + ( Fig . 4B ) . This difference can be explained 220 by sustained interactions between residues at the SD2 - SD4 interface ( Fig . 4C and Fig . S6 ) . We 221 observed that when ADP is bound , the volume of the active site exhibited reduced Ô¨Çuctuations 222 ( Fig . 4D ) . In all our conditions ( HIS73 , HIC73 , HIC73 + Mg 2 + ) , the magnesium ion in the binding site 223 was directly bound to the nucleotide ( Fig . 4E ) , despite variations in the number of water molecules 224 around the ion ( Fig . 4F ) . Finally , the binding of ADP also affected the allosteric paths between SD2 225 and SD4 by involving a direct interaction between ARG62 and GLU207 ( Fig 4 . G , H and Fig . S6 ) , or by 226 passing through TYR69 - ARG183 . Thus , in the conditions observed in our simulations , the binding 227 of ADP reduced the impact of histidine 73 methylation on actin plasticity . 228 229 Impact of the deafness - causing mutation on histidine 73 methylated actin dynamics . The 230 mutation of lysine 118 into asparagine ( LYS118ASN ) has been shown to cause deafness Rubenstein 231 and Wen ( 2014 ) , most likely due to its impact on the rate of actin polymerization and nucleation 232 Ali et al . ( 2022 ) ; Kruth and Rubenstein ( 2012 ) . However , whether histidine 73 methylation status 233 inÔ¨Çuences the extent to which this mutation affects actin behavior has not been examined . To 234 7 of 21 have a better comprehensive view on the inÔ¨Çuence of this mutation on actin Ô¨Ålament nucleation , 235 we conducted simulations with LYS118ASN actin in the presence of both ATP or ADP and HIS73 236 methylation ( HIC73 ) . In the presence of ATP , the cleft - dihedral proÔ¨Åle ( Fig . S2 ) revealed a more 237 open state , yet more focused , closely resembling conformations seen in the case of HIC73 with ad - 238 dition of magnesium ions . Interestingly , for bound ATP , the actin Ô¨Çexibility was also reduced ( Fig . 239 S3 ) compared to the wild type HIC73 . This suggests that the LYS118ASN mutation not only induces 240 a more open conformation but also imparts a degree of structural rigidity to the actin Ô¨Ålament in 241 the presence of ATP . Conversely , in the presence of ADP , the mutation had a very low impact on 242 the cleft - dihedral map . 243 244 Histidine 73 methylation stabilizes F - actin at the barbed end Transition from G - actin to F - 245 actin that accompanies actin polymerization is essential for cellular function . To understand the 246 impact of H73 methylation on F - actin assembly and dynamics , as a function of nucleotide binding , 247 we analyzed conformational dynamics of actin subunits at the barbed end of the Ô¨Ålament . Simu - 248 lations were performed on the four F - actin subunits , with the two subunits towards the pointed 249 end constrained to mimic a longer Ô¨Ålament , and two on the barbed ( growing ) end free to sam - 250 ple broad conformational space ( see details in the Method section ) . For all the subunits , H73 was 251 either methylated ( HIC73 ) or non - methylated ( HIS73 ) , and the active site contained either ATP or 252 ADP . Utilizing 1 . 52 ¬µs of polarizable MD simulations with adaptive sampling , we explored the dy - 253 namics of the last ( B ) and penultimate ( B - 1 ) subunits at the barbed end ( Fig . 5A ) , which have been 254 reported to experience major deformations Zsolnay et al . ( 2020 ) . In the methylated system , the 255 last F - actin ( B ) subunit exhibited more pronounced deformation when ADP was bound , than in 256 the presence of ATP ( Fig . S9A ) , which is in contrast to what we observed in G - actin . SpeciÔ¨Åcally , 257 with ADP bound , the cleft - dihedral proÔ¨Åle of HIC73 displayed conformations resembling those ob - 258 served for HIS73 G - actin monomers ( Fig . 4B ) . The penultimate ( B - 1 ) subunit appeared less affected 259 by the nucleotide state , probably due to a higher number of contacts with the other subunits in 260 the Ô¨Ålament ( Fig . S8 and Fig . S9B ) . For both B and B - 1 subunits , the dynamics of the H1 helix was 261 the most affected in comparison to the monomeric form ( Fig . S9 ) . For HIC73 , in the B subunit , this 262 helix strongly interacted with the C - terminal residues of the B - 1 subunit for bound ADP but not 263 in the case of ATP ( Fig . S10 ) . Both ATP - and ADP - bound HIS73 systems were less stabilized in the 264 F - actin conformation than the ATP - bound HIC73 system ( Fig . 5B ) . We also observed more interac - 265 tions between the C - terminal part of the B - 1 subunit and the H1 helix of the B subunit in these 266 systems ( Fig . S10 ) . These results showed that H73 methylation also modulated multiple different 267 aspects of F - actin plasticity , further highlighting the biological signiÔ¨Åcance of this PTM . 268 269 Histidine 73 methylation reduces the opening of a molecular backdoor at the barbed end . 270 Molecular dynamics simulations were recently used to propose two plausible pathways for the re - 271 lease of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) after ATP hydrolysis in the F - actin state Oosterheert et al . ( 2023 ) . 272 The Ô¨Årst pathway involves the breaking of the interaction between ARG177 and ASN111 , and was 273 experimentally validated , while the second one requires breaking of the SER14 - GLY74 interaction 274 ( see Fig . 5C ) Chou and Pollard ( 2019 ) . This pathway remains to be experimentally demonstrated . 275 Based on our simulations , this second backdoor was mainly closed in the presence of methylated 276 histidine , and open for non - methylated histidine in the ATP - bound state of both B ( Fig . 5D ) and 277 B - 1 ( Fig . 5E ) actin subunits . Interestingly , the reanalysis of the data openly deposited by the Hum - 278 mer lab Oosterheert et al . ( 2023 ) ( see Method section ) agreed well in term of opening and closing 279 distances for this second backdoor ( Fig . 5D , E ) . This model additionally proposed that the ARG177 - 280 ASN111 interaction was always open for the last actin subunit Oosterheert et al . ( 2023 ) . We also 281 observed that this backdoor remains open in the last subunit , independently of the histidine methy - 282 lation ( Fig . S11 ) . To test the impact of the histidine methylation on the release of Pi within F - actin 283 subunits , we performed in vitro actin Ô¨Ålament depolymerization assays using microÔ¨Çuidics J√©gou 284 et al . ( 2011 ) ( Fig 5 - F , see Methods ) . We observed that the Pi release rate was almost 3 - fold lower for 285 8 of 21 histidine - methylated ùõΩ - actin compared to the non - methylated one ( Fig . 5G and Fig . S12 ) . Our data , 286 together with the recent observations Oosterheert et al . ( 2023 ) , indicate that histidine methylation 287 controls the release of Pi in F - actin , mainly by delaying the opening of the SER14 - GLY74 backdoor . 288 Discussion 289 In this study , we performed a series of adaptive sampling simulations using a polarizable force Ô¨Åeld 290 on 17 different actin systems ( Table S1 ) , reaching a total time of simulation of more than 25 ¬µs . Al - 291 though actin has been extensively studied using classical computational strategies Splettstoesser 292 et al . ( 2009 ) ; Saunders and Voth ( 2011 ) ; Saunders et al . ( 2014 ) ; McCullagh et al . ( 2014 ) ; Jepsen and 293 Sept ( 2020 ) ; Chu and Voth ( 2005 ) ; Hocky et al . ( 2016 ) ; Jepsen and Sept ( 2020 ) ; Zsolnay et al . ( 2020 ) 294 this work represents the Ô¨Årst study of actin using polarizable forceÔ¨Åelds , which improves accuracy 295 of modeling interatomic interactions . This accuracy , in turn , enables more accurate insights into 296 molecular determinants of conformational changes and dynamics that accompany actin assembly 297 and function . Notably , the barbed end models , containing more than 250k atoms , represent , to 298 the best of our knowledge , one of the largest systems being modelled with this type of forceÔ¨Åeld 299 and for such extended timescale . 300 Although focusing our core interest on ùõΩ - actin , as a more prevalent yet less understood actin 301 isoform , we used ùõº - actin to benchmark our approach . Overall , our results for this isoform are 302 in broad agreement with previous atomistic simulations Jepsen and Sept ( 2020 ) ; Saunders et al . 303 ( 2014 ) , supporting the validity of polarizable forceÔ¨Åeld approach . For example , in our study the cleft 304 distance varied from 23 to 25 √Ö in the ATP state , which is similar to what was seen by Saunders et al . 305 Saunders et al . ( 2014 ) . However , we note that the dihedral angle values varied among the studies : 306 - 18 to - 23 degrees for Saunders et al . Saunders et al . ( 2014 ) , - 11 . 7 degrees in recent work by Jepsen 307 et al . Jepsen and Sept ( 2020 ) , and - 12 to - 18 degrees in our calculations . Some of this variability 308 may be due to the intrinsic difference between the results obtained using of a polarizable force 309 Ô¨Åeld and those from non - polarizable atomistic force Ô¨Åeld simulations , as recently demonstrated 310 for other proteins El Ahdab et al . ( 2021 ) . Importantly , our simulations revealed that ùõº - and ùõΩ - actin 311 exhibited distinct patterns of Ô¨Çexibility , suggesting that these differences may explain functional 312 differences that exist despite exceptionally high level of sequence identity . Differences observed 313 in our simulations are consistent with a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in phosphate release rate between 314 ùõº - actin and ùõΩ - actin , the latter releasing its phosphate slightly faster J√©gou et al . ( 2011 ) ( Fig S12 ) . 315 Therefore , our study hints at protein dynamics as the key difference between otherwise almost 316 identical actin isoforms expressed by mammals . 317 In addition to expanding our understanding of ùõΩ - actin , we also addressed the role of a highly 318 conserved , yet relatively incompletely understood PTM , H73 methylation Kwiatkowski et al . ( 2018 ) ; 319 Wilkinson et al . ( 2019 ) . Recent studies have shown that unmethylated actin shows an increased 320 rate of nucleotide exchange in the monomeric form , and a slower Ô¨Ålament assembly rate Wilkin - 321 son et al . ( 2019 ) ; Guo et al . ( 2019 ) . Additionally , H73 methylation was shown to increase actin 322 Ô¨Ålament stability Kwiatkowski et al . ( 2018 ) . Our results showed an enhanced internal dynamics 323 of the methylated actin monomer in the ATP state which may account for these previous obser - 324 vations . Our simulations of the ùõΩ - actin isoform highlighted a wider opening of the cleft between 325 SD2 and SD4 subdomains in the G - actin form due to the disruption of direct interactions between 326 ARG62 and GLU207 . This opening may have implications during the early steps required for the 327 nucleation of actin Ô¨Ålaments . As ARG62 and GLU207 residues are also involved in inter - subunits 328 interactions in the Ô¨Ålament , they thus need to be rearranged accordingly Oda et al . ( 2009 ) . Based 329 on our results , we speculate that direct interactions between ARG62 and GLU207 may affect inter - 330 actions between actin subunits , thereby limiting the nucleation process . 331 We also examined mutual relationships between H73 methylation and environmental factors , 332 such as magnesium ions and nucleotides . In general , we observed that actin plasticity is affected 333 not only by H73 methylation , but by other factors as well . Most notably , ADP binding may lock the 334 actin monomer in an closed state , impeding G - actin structural adaptation at the Ô¨Ålament barbed 335 9 of 21 end . It is therefore reasonable to think that interactions between intra - monomer residues may 336 compete with interactions between inter - monomer residues both during the nucleation and elon - 337 gation of Ô¨Ålaments . Our results demonstrate how histidine methylation affects these essential in - 338 teractions . Finally , histidine methylation may also play a role in stabilizing subunits at the barbed 339 end , as in the absence of methylation , the last subunit tends to relax more quickly towards the 340 G - actin form 341 Using correlation - based dynamical network analysis we were able to link actin Ô¨Çexibility with 342 distinct allosteric paths between the SD2 and SD4 subdomains of ùõΩ - actin , which are critical for 343 deÔ¨Åning the size and openness of the nucleotide binding cleft , and thus ATP hydrolysis . This led 344 to the insight that in the case of ATP - bound methylated G - actin , the main allosteric paths were 345 re - routed through the sensor loop . Conversely , allosteric paths observed in the ADP - bound states 346 almost never involved this loop , minimizing the impact of histidine methylation on SD2 - SD4 mo - 347 bility . Altogether , these results offer initial insights into how allosteric paths drive local molecu - 348 lar rearrangements in the active site towards large conformational changes at the actin Ô¨Ålament 349 ends , and how they may Ô¨Åne - tune mechanical properties of actin Ô¨Ålaments De La Cruz et al . ( 2010 ) ; 350 Reynolds et al . ( 2022 ) . This may further inform our understanding of why side - binding proteins , 351 such as ADF / coÔ¨Ålin , are highly sensitive to both the nucleotide state of actin Ô¨Ålaments and their 352 mechanical state Cao et al . ( 2006 ) ; Wioland et al . ( 2017 , 2019 ) ; Lappalainen et al . ( 2022 ) . 353 Our results also highlighted that H73 methylation increases the volume of the active site , with - 354 out changing the number of water molecules inside the active site . This may indicate that methyla - 355 tion inÔ¨Çuences the structuring of the water network that participates in ATP hydrolysis McCullagh 356 et al . ( 2014 ) ; Kanematsu et al . ( 2022 ) , rather than the amount of water molecules available . Our 357 results also highlight that histidine methylation tunes Pi release . The Pi release rate within Ô¨Åla - 358 ments is faster for non - methylated ùõΩ - actin , which may be related to the opening of more than one 359 backdoors , as further revealed by our simulations at the Ô¨Ålament barbed end . 360 Overall , our results highlighted how the post translational modiÔ¨Åcation of histidine 73 can dras - 361 tically change the dynamic properties of actin in different forms , from the monomer to the Ô¨Ålament . 362 Furthermore , effects of H73 methylation and environmental factors seem to be tightly coupled , 363 and exert mutual , functionally relevant modulations . Thus , our work reveals how subtle structural 364 changes , such as a simple methylation buried within the core of the protein , could have numerous 365 consequences that affect protein plasticity at different scales . Importantly , although understudied , 366 histidine methylation has now been reported in other proteins , such as S100A9 , myosin , skeletal 367 muscle myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK 2 ) , and ribosomal protein Rpl3 Kwiatkowski and Drozak 368 ( 2020 ) , with a recent analysis identifying about 300 histidine methylation sites in the proteome of 369 HeLa cells Kapell and Jakobsson ( 2021 ) . Similar to what we observed in ùõΩ - actin , we expect that this 370 PTM plays a major regulatory role in many of these systems . Thus , our study highlights the value 371 of using MD simulations combined with polarizable forceÔ¨Åelds as a method for understanding the 372 effects of this PTM in actin and beyond . 373 Methods and Materials 374 Systems preparation 375 The initial structures of the Actin monomer in the ATP and ADP were obtained from the 1NWK 376 Graceffa and Dominguez ( 2003 ) and 1J6Z Otterbein et al . ( 2001 ) pdb structures respectively . In the 377 ATP state , the ùõº and ùõΩ - actin sequences were used . As the N - terminal acetylation or arginylation 378 of the ùõΩ - actin is known to have diverse biological effects Varland et al . ( 2019 ) ; Chen and Kashina 379 ( 2021 ) , we decided to remove the N - terminal amino acid , starting our ùõΩ - actin sequence at ASP2 . 380 The N - terminal and C - terminal extremities and the D - loop were generated using modeller ≈†ali 381 and Blundell ( 1993 ) . In the original pdb Ô¨Åles , the nucleotide is under the form of AMP and in pres - 382 ence of a calcium ion . We replaced the AMP by ATP and the calcium ion by a magnesium ion , to be 383 closer to physiological conditions . 384 10 of 21 It has been demonstrated that crystallographic water molecules located inside the cavity may 385 impact the behaviour of the protein Saunders and Voth ( 2011 ) . Therefore , the water molecules 386 placed at less than 10√Öof the magnesium ion were kept . 387 In addition to the monomer systems , two 4 - mer systems were prepared based on the 6BNO 388 Gurel et al . ( 2017 ) pdb Ô¨Åle , in presence of ADP and ATP . For the ATP state , the ADP has been 389 replaced by ATP . The N - terminal and C - terminal extremities only were generated using modeller . 390 For all systems , the residues have been protonated following the results of PROPKA3 Olsson 391 et al . ( 2011 ) . All systems were solvated in water boxes using the xyzedit tool of the Tinker - hp 392 distribution Rackers et al . ( 2018 ) , so that there was at least 20√Öbetween two images of the protein . 393 The systems were then neutralized and KCL atoms were added to reach 150mM concentration . 394 Regarding the simulations at high Mg 2 + ions concentrations , all K + atoms were replaced by half 395 number of Mg 2 + ions . 396 The force Ô¨Åeld parameters used for the protein parameters was the AMOEBA Polarizable force 397 Ô¨Åeld for proteins Shi et al . ( 2013 ) . Previously published parameters were used for the ATP and 398 ADP systems Walker et al . ( 2020 ) . The parameters of the HIC73 residues were developed following 399 the procedure used to develop the AMOEBA force Ô¨Åeld for proteins . All QM calculations were per - 400 formed using Gaussian09 Frisch et al . ( 2009 ) . The model residue used to develop the parameters 401 was a dipeptide Ac - HIC - NME were the Ac , NME and backbone parameters were extracted from the 402 AMOEBABIO18 force Ô¨Åeld Zhang et al . ( 2018 ) . BrieÔ¨Çy , geometry optimisation were carried out at 403 the MP2 / 6 - 31G * level . Initial atomic multipoles were derived at the MP2 / 6 - 311G * * level using the 404 Distributed Dipole Analysis ( DMA ) procedure Stone ( 1981 ) . The resulting atomic multip√¥les were 405 optimized against MP2 / aug - cc - pvtz electrostatic potential on a set of grid points distributed around 406 the dipeptide . During this Ô¨Åtting , the monopoles were held Ô¨Åxed . The point charges were adjusted 407 at the junction atom between the backbone and the sidechain ( adjustment of 0 . 03 on the - CH2 - 408 carbon atom charge ) , to insure electrical neutrality . As realised in the original AMOEBA for protein 409 publication , 3 conformations were used to realize the Ô¨Åtting of the dip√¥le and multip√¥le compo - 410 nents . The valence , vdW and torsional parameters were extracted from the AMOEBA parameters 411 of the classical HIS residue . 412 Simulation setup 413 All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the GPU version of the Tinker - HP soft - 414 ware Adjoua et al . ( 2021 ) . During the calculations , periodic boundary conditions were employed 415 using the Particle Mesh Ewald method . The van der Waals and PME cutoffs were respectively of 416 12√Öand 7√Ö . An analytical long range correction of the vdW interactions has been used . The dipole 417 convergence criterion of the preconditioned conjugate gradient polarization solver was set to 0 . 01 418 Debye / atom for the minimization steps , and to 0 . 00001 Debye / atom otherwise . 419 For the minimization steps , no polarization or electrostatics terms were used . The systems un - 420 derwent a minimization of 30 000 step using a L - BFGS optimizer . The next equilibration steps were 421 realised using a timestep of 1fs , the RESPA integrator and the berendsen barostat ( when relevant ) 422 unless stated otherwise . The solvent was then progressively heat up in the NVT ensemble , from 423 5K to 300K using 10K steps and spending 5ps at each temperature , before undergoing additional 424 100ps at 300K . The system was then allowed to slowly relax for 3 times 400ps in the NPT ensemble 425 while applying harmonic restraints of 10 , 5 and Ô¨Ånally 1 kcal / mol / A on the backbone atoms of the 426 protein . Then , all restraints were removed , and we used the montecarlo barostat in combination 427 with the BAOAB - RESPA1 Lagard√®re et al . ( 2019 ) propagator . Three Ô¨Ånal equilibration steps were 428 performed for 100ps , 200ps and 500 ps by respectively increasing the outer timestep from 1fs to 429 2fs up to 5fs . 430 Regarding the production run , all calculations were performed in the NPT ensemble , using the 431 montecarlo barostat and the BAOAB - RESPA1 propagator with an outer timestep of 5fs , and hydro - 432 gen mass repartioning . A Ô¨Årst 10ns simulations was performed to generate a Ô¨Årst set of structures . 433 In order to maximize the phase space exploration , we then resorted to an adaptive sampling pro - 434 11 of 21 Table 1 . Number of seeds of each round of Adaptive sampling . 1st 2nd to 10th total simulation time 8 * 10ns 16 * 10ns 1 . 52¬µs cedure : a certain number of structures were Ô¨Årst extracted from this initial simulation to perform 435 the Ô¨Årst adaptive sampling round . The seeds were then chosen following a procedure already de - 436 scribed in Jaffrelot Inizan et al . ( 2021 ) . BrieÔ¨Çy , a principal component analysis is performed on the 437 10ns simulation using the scikit - learn Pedregosa et al . ( 2011 ) and MDTraj McGibbon et al . ( 2015 ) 438 packages from which the n = 4 Ô¨Årst principal modes are considered ( note : 10 modes are calculated ) . 439 The density ùúå ùëò of the conformational space is then projected on the 4 modes and approximated 440 using a Gaussian density kernel estimator : 441 ùúå ùëò ( ùë• ùëñ ) = 1 ( 2 ùúãùúé 2 ) ùëõ ‚àï2 ùëÄ ùëò ùëÄ ùëò ‚àë ùëñ = 1 exp‚àí | ùë• ‚àí ùë• ùëñ | 2 2 ùúé 2 ( 1 ) With the ùúé bandwith being chosen with the D . W Scott method of Scipy Virtanen et al . ( 2020 ) , ùëÄ ùëò 442 being the total number of conÔ¨Ågurations , ùë• ùëñ the orthogonal projection of the conÔ¨Åguration on the 443 n PCA modes . Then a bias is introduced to the selection of a new seed ùë• ùëñ under the following form 444 : 445 ùëÉ ( ùëñ ) = ùúå ‚àí1 ùëò ( ùë• ùëñ ) ùëÄ ùëò ‚àë ùëó = 1 ùúå ‚àí1 ùëò ( ùë• ùëó ) ( 2 ) The probability of selecting the ùë• ùëñ structure is inversely proportional to its density , projected on 446 the Ô¨Årst 4 PCA components , favoring new , undiscovered structural states . 447 Following this , 10 ns simulations were run to form the new phase space of structures for the 448 next adaptive sampling round . For each following round , all simulations are added to the confor - 449 mational space on which the next adaptive sampling are performed . The number of seeds used 450 for each round is summed up in Table 1 . 451 Regarding the 4 - mer systems , we were interested in the behaviour of the barbed end only . For 452 this extremity , it has recently been demonstrated that the behaviour of the B and B - 1 residues 453 is different than other residues of the Ô¨Ålament Zsolnay et al . ( 2020 ) . Therefore , to simulate the 454 behaviour of this extremity only , the backbone atoms of two monomers forming the pointed end 455 have been constrained using a 10kcal / mol restraint . This way , it was possible to study the evolu - 456 tion of the barbed end in a constrained Ô¨Ålament , while keeping the sidechains free . 1 . 52 ¬µs long 457 simulations were generated on thirteen monomer systems and four 4 - mer systems , resulting in a 458 total of 25 . 84 ¬µs ( see Table S1 ) . 459 Molecular Dynamics Analysis 460 For analysis , the data were collected each 100 ps of simulation . Measures have been performed 461 using the VMD software Humphrey et al . ( 1996 ) . 462 The Root Mean Square Fluctuations of an amino acid i has been deÔ¨Åned as previously described 463 Welford ( 1962 ) : 464 ùëÖùëÄùëÜùêπ ùëñ = ‚àö < ( ùë• ùëñ ‚àí ùë• ùëöùëúùë¶ ) 2 > ( 3 ) with ùë• ùëñ the position of the center of mass of the backbone of the amino acid i at a certain frame , 465 and ùë• ùëüùëíùëì its ensemble averaged position . 466 Active site volumes have been computed using E - pock program Laurent et al . ( 2015 ) . We Ô¨Årst 467 deÔ¨Åned a Maximum Encompassing Region ( MER ) by concatenating spheres to deÔ¨Åne the maximum 468 volume of the active site as followed : a 6√Ö sphere around the N1 , N9 , PA , PG ( PB for ADP ) atoms 469 12 of 21 Table 2 . DeÔ¨Ånition of each subdomain SD1 SD2 SD3 SD4 Residues 5 - 33 80 - 147 334 - 349 34 - 39 52 - 69 148 - 179 273 - 333 180 - 219 252 - 262 of the nucleotide and one additional sphere around the Mg 2 + ion coordinated to it . Then , for each 470 frame of the trajectory , E - pock calculated a 3D grid based on the MER and removed grid cells which 471 were overlapping with residues from the active site . The remaining cells deÔ¨Åned the free volume 472 of the active site . 473 Shortest paths have been calculated using the Dynamical Network Analysis ( Dynetan ) tool Melo 474 et al . ( 2020 ) . This program allowed deÔ¨Åning nodes based on residues alpha carbons . The minimum 475 distance between two nodes was measured on each frame of the simulation . If this distance is 476 lower than 4 . 5 √Ö for more than 75 % of the simulation , the two nodes were considered in contact . 477 Once all nodes in contact were determined , correlation of motion was calculated between them 478 to create the optimal correlation paths . For the calculation of allosteric paths , the shortest path of 479 each seed has been calculated on the 10ns . Then all found shortest paths were reweighted across 480 all seeds , and the 3 highest shortest paths have been kept for Ô¨Ågures . All shortest paths accounting 481 for more than 3 percent of all paths are available in supplementary information . 482 The dihedral and cleft angle has been deÔ¨Åned following the work of Saunders and coworkers 483 Saunders et al . ( 2014 ) : Dihedral = SD2 - SD1 - SD3 - SD4 , Cleft = SD2 - SD4 distance . To caculate these 484 values , the center of mass of each subdomains have been deÔ¨Åned as displayed in table2 . 485 Each of the observable had to be reweighted to take into account the bias introduced by the 486 adaptive sampling . For this purpose , the unbiasing factor ùõº ùëñ of each seed is deÔ¨Åned as : 487 ùõº ùëñ = 1 ùëÄ ùëò ùëÉ ( ùëñ ) ( 4 ) The Ô¨Ånal weight of each seed is then : 488 ùúî ùëñ = ùõº ùëñ ‚àë ùëó ùõº ùëó ( 5 ) We reanalysed data from the Hummer lab available at : https : / / zenodo . org / records / 7765025 489 Blanc ( 2023 ) . We have used the trajectory called replica _ 031 from the dataset : 490 simulations _ dataset _ 1 / Metady - namics / BarbedEnd _ meH73p / representative _ trajectories 491 corresponding to the Hummer lab enhanced sampling protocol based on simulating swarms of 492 short metadynamics trajectories to open the second physically plausible pathways Okazaki and 493 Hummer ( 2013 ) . By methodological means , the G74 - S14 backdoor was closed in the initial half of 494 the simulation ( metaD _ i ) and then open in the Ô¨Ånal half of the simulation ( metaD _ f ) . 495 In vitro measurement of Pi - release rate 496 Human cytoplasmic ùõΩ - actin was expressed and puriÔ¨Åed from yeast Pichia Pastoris , following estab - 497 lished protocol Hatano et al . ( 2020 ) . Actin was cotransfected with the N - acetyl transferase NAA80 , 498 and with or without histidine methyltransferase SETD3 , for N - terminal acetylation and His73 methy - 499 lation respectively . 500 In vitro Ô¨Çuorescence microscopy experiments were performed in microÔ¨Çuidic chambers , as de - 501 scribed in AU Wioland et al . ( 2022 ) . BrieÔ¨Çy , tens of single actin Ô¨Ålaments were polymerized for 502 10 - 15 min from surface - anchored spectrin - actin seeds with a solution containing 1 ¬µM monomeric 503 ùõΩ - actin , 1 ¬µM human proÔ¨Ålin and 0 . 5 - 1 ¬µM ATP - ATTO Colombo et al . ( 2021 ) in F - buffer ( 10 mM Tris 504 HCl pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCL2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 1 mM DABCO ) sup - 505 plemented with 50 mM KPO4 buffer pH 7 . 4 to maintain actin in an ADP - Pi state . Filaments were 506 13 of 21 then exposed from time t = 0 to F - buffer only ( without KPO4 ) , triggering their barbed - end depoly - 507 merization and Pi release from actin subunits . Images were acquired on a Nikon Ti microscope , 508 60x objective , X - cite Exact lamp and Orca Flash 4 . 0 camera , at 1 frame every 2 to 5 s . 509 Movies were analyzed with a custom - made Python algorithm ( available upon request ) which 510 tracks the depolymerizing barbed end of each Ô¨Ålament ( used packages : numpy , scipy , matplotlib , 511 trackpy ) .
