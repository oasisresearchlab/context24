This new model provides both elastic and non - specific adhesion properties of cells and soft gels by taking sample thickness at the point of indentation and its depth of indentation into consideration . The bottom substrate effect is the most common source of error in the study of “AFM force maps” of the cellular sample . The present model incorporates an asymptotically correct correction term as a function of depth of indentation to eliminate the substrate effect in the analysis . Later , the model is extended to analyze the unloading portion of the indentation curve to extract the stiffness and adhesive properties simultaneously . A comparative study of the estimated material properties using other established contact models shows that the provided corrections effectively curb the errors coming from infinite thickness assumption . Non - specific adhesive nature of a cell is represented in terms of adhesion parameter ( γ a ) based on the “work of adhesion” , this is an alternative to the peak value of tip - sample Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

The simple analytical expression of the model can help in estimating more realistic and accurate biomechanical properties of cells from atomic force microscopy based indentation technique . 1 . INTRODUCTION The Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) instrument has become an integral part of the cell mechanics research community . Its hybridization with an optical microscope has helped to correlate the structural modifications in cells with disease progression [ 1 - 6 ] , drug effects [ 1 , 7 - 9 ] and cell - nanoparticle interaction [ 10 - 11 ] through the study of material modulus or elastic maps [ 12 - 17 ] . It is a well - known fact that the unloading part of indentation curve carries important information about the non - specific adhesive behavior of cells . These non - specific adhesive forces between the cell membrane and surrounding tissues play a major role in cancer cell migration [ 3 , 6 ] . AFM force - indentation method can detect and differentiate the changes in non - specific cell adhesion between tumor and normal healthy cells [ 3 , 6 , 18 ] . Both stiffness and adhesion are related and modulated throughout the course of disease progression . Hence , it is important to compare these complementary properties simultaneously for a better understanding of the cellular material . A reliable estimate of elastic and adhesive parameters is essential for accurate prediction of cellular mechanics , and its relation to a physiological condition . AFM - based indentation tests require reliable contact model , which can interpret the tip - sample interaction precisely while predicting the material properties of cells . Current literature shows that Hertzian contact models [ 19 - 20 ] are very popular . The popularity of these classical contact models lies in their simplicity of closed form expressions and easy interpretation of indentation physics . These models are based on Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Sitikantha Roy , Applied Mechanics Department , IIT Delhi Assigned Paper No : Bio - 16 - 1334 3 many assumptions which need to be understood properly before using them for analysis . In these models , the sample is assumed as an elastic half - space or of infinite thickness made of a non - adhesive homogeneous material . This limits the application of these models to the analysis of adhesion free indentation curves taken on thick samples where bottom substrate influence doesn’t appear . In the literature , some quantitative methods have been developed for the analysis of material properties by considering adhesion influence into contact models [ 21 - 23 ] . In the case of non - spherical tips , L . Sirghi et al . [ 18 , 24 - 25 ] developed contact models for sharp tips for the simultaneous evaluation of both elastic and non - specific adhesion properties . However , these models fail to predict the accurate mechanical properties in the thin regions of a sample because of the bottom substrate effect . In most cases , AFM is used to probe the samples which have a thickness in the range of nm to μm . The evaluated sample properties become a function of transverse strain or relative depth of indentation ( δ / h ) , where ‘δ’ is the indentation depth and ‘h’ is the height of the sample at the location of indentation . The presence of stiff substrate affects transverse deformations , due to which the sample appears stiffer than natural . If not accounted for , bottom substrate effect leads to over - estimation of the measured properties [ 26 ] . To avoid bottom substrate effect different practices are adopted . For example , restricting indentation study to the thicker region or by applying lower force i . e . restricting the indentation depth ( within 10 % of the sample height ) and in a cell - like material indenting near the nucleus zone [ 2 , 5 - 8 , 27 ] . Moreover , there exists a limit to the minimum force value which one can apply during indentation . Below this limit , the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Sitikantha Roy , Applied Mechanics Department , IIT Delhi Assigned Paper No : Bio - 16 - 1334 4 obtained indentation data becomes unreliable due to the low signal to noise ratio , thermal fluctuation of the plasma membrane and uncertainty in detecting the contact point [ 28 29 ] . Instead of changing parameter values and sample regions , the better approach is to develop a new contact model which can filter out the bottom substrate amplification effect . In the literature , very few analytical solutions exist on modeling this effect on the indentation of finite thickness elastic sample . E . K . Dimitriadis et al . [ 30 ] and R . E . Mahaffy et al . ( 2004 ) [ 31 ] developed an analytical correction to Hertz contact model [ 19 ] for a spherical tip indentation on bonded and non - bonded sample to a rigid base for the extraction of elastic and viscoelastic properties . J . A . S . Santos et al . ( 2012 ) [ 32 ] addressed the finite thickness effect in conical tip indentation studies and provided an empirical correction factor using finite element simulation . Later N . Gavara et al . [ 33 ] tried to derive an analytical solution for conical tip indentation studies based on contact mechanics , leading to an erroneous correction to the bottom substrate effect . The inconsistency in the consecutive terms within correction factor [ 33 ] leads to an under - estimation of elastic properties at the thin regions of sample ( < 10μm ) . Moreover , all these models fail to analyze adhesion influenced AFM indentation data . There is a need for a new contact model which is mathematically correct and which can provide elastic and non - specific adhesion properties of soft matters like cells and gel by considering the finite thickness of the sample . In the present work , a new contact model for conical tip geometry is developed for the analysis of force - indentation curves . It accounts for the effects of tip geometrical shape , finite thickness of the sample , elastic and non - specific adhesive nature of the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

The new model is experimentally tested on thick polyacrylamide gel ( ≈200μm ) and cells of finite thickness ( ≈10μm ) to verify consistency with previous models . The effectiveness of correction term is tested by comparing the measured elastic properties at locations with varying thickness transversely isotropic gel ( provided in the Appendix ) and varying thickness MCF - 7 cell surface . Adhesion influenced “unloading curves” are analyzed to extract elastic modulus and non - specific adhesion properties of the cell simultaneously . In addition , the adhesive property of cells is expressed in terms of adhesion parameter ‘γ a ’ instead of peak negative force seen during the tip - sample detachment event . This parameter is evaluated by analyzing the complete retraction data . 2 . THEORETICAL MODEL In AFM - based nanoindentation process , two types of forces act on the cantilever . Those are reaction forces because of material deformation and material surface forces . The adhesive force is a short range surface force , and it opposes tip - sample detachment during the unloading process . In the following derivation , we have assumed that the material is finitely thick , homogeneous incompressible elastic material . Sample shows pure elastic deformation during both loading and unloading . Membrane shows negligible pre - tension [ 18 ] , therefore structural forces like bending forces do not play a significant role in opposing externally applied force . There will be continuous variation in the indenter - cell contact area and associated indenter cell adhesion energy during loading and unloading . It is assumed that the electrostatic interaction , steric repulsion between cell and tip are absent and influence of adhesion seen in the indentation curve is only Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

The total force ( F ) experienced by the cantilever at any instant during the retraction process is the sum of elastic recovery force ( F e ) and the membrane adhesive force ( F a ) at the tip - sample contact , eqn ( 1 ) [ 18 , 34 ] . Both F e and F a are a function of indentation depth ( δ ) which is a material response to externally applied force . The equation for both the terms is derived separately by considering sample finite thickness . ( 1 ) 2 . 1 . Elastic Force Derivation At first , the derivation for the elastic force ( F e ) coming from the sample due to conical tip indentation is derived from Betti - Rayleigh reciprocal theorem [ 35 - 36 ] , as given in eqn ( 2 ) .

In the absence of adhesive forces , the total traction force on conical indenter surface is nothing but elastic recovery force , F e coming from the sample .

The unknown pressure distribution is obtained following a similar approach as given by Landau and Lifshitz [ 37 ] and shown in eqn ( 4 ) . G ( s ) is Green’s function representing deformation profile of a finite thickness ( h ) bonded sample subjected to a point force . A detailed explanation related to Green’s function and evaluation of pressure terms is provided in the appendix . After obtaining the expression for P ( r ) from eqn ( 4 ) , it is substituted in eqn ( 3 ) and subsequently integrated over contact radius ( a ) to derive an expression for F e , which is the sum of total traction forces acting on the sample surface in the absence of adhesive force . The expression for F e ( δ , h , E , a ) is given in eqn ( 5 ) . The unknown contact radius ‘ a ’ is found by setting dF / da = 0 [ 38 ] and given in eqn ( 6 ) .

( 7 ) 2 . 2 . Adhesive Force Derivation In most soft matters like cells , the non - specific adhesion seen in the unloading curve is in fact , the result of the continuous breaking of contact bonds formed between tip and sample surface . The required adhesion force F a in eqn ( 1 ) can be derived from adhesion energy ( w a ) during retraction , as shown in eqn ( 8 ) . Here , force F a is the derivative of adhesion energy . The adhesion energy is a product of parameter ( γ a ) and instantaneous contact area ( A C ) . Hence , ‘ γ a ’ is defined as the surface energy per unit area required to separate two bodies and has an SI unit of J / m 2 [ 18 , 39 ] .

Sitikantha Roy , Applied Mechanics Department , IIT Delhi Assigned Paper No : Bio - 16 - 1334 9 the material to an applied force and a linear term which accounts for the variation of adhesive forces between the probe tip and the sample surface . The parameter ‘ γ a ' provides the overall information about the non - specific adhesive nature of a sample captured in an indentation curve . Both the terms contain a correction factor ( given within curly brace in eqn . 11 ) to accommodate the deformation restraint effects due to finite thickness . Here the correction is in the form of non - dimensional term δ / h and asymptotically correct up to 2 2 ( ) h O  , where ‘h’ is the height of the sample at the point of indentation . The asymptotical correctness requires , 1 1 n n t t   and 1 0 li m ( ) 0 n n h t t     , where ‘t n ’ is the n th term in the series . In other words , the contribution to total correction diminishes in an asymptotical sense towards convergence . It is clear that , 0 < δ / h < 1 , where δ / h→0 refers to thick sample and δ / h→1 refers to the indentation in the thin region . The correction term captures the whole range between these two limiting conditions . For δ / h→0 , the equation tends to converge to a solution for the thick elastic sample with adhesion [ 25 ] . In the case of adhesion free thick elastic sample ( γ a = 0 , δ / h→0 ) , the equation tends to converge to classical Sneddon’s solution [ 20 ] . The asymptotical correctness and simultaneous evaluation of both elastic and non - specific adhesion properties are the major improvements achieved in the present model compared to the earlier works [ 33 ] . The generality of the correction lies in this asymptotical nature of the formulation . Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Cell Culture In the present study , MCF - 7 adenocarcinoma breast cancer cell line procured from NCCS - Pune is cultured as per the standard protocols given below . Cells are grown on the No . 1 ( 0 . 13 mm - 0 . 16 mm ) glass coverslip ( Ø = 24mm , Blue Star ) in an in - vitro environmental condition of 37 0 C temperature , 5 % CO 2 and 95 % humidity in an incubator ( NB - 203 , N - BIOTEK ) . Complete media consists of DMEM - 1X ( GIBCO - 11965 - 092 ) with 10 % FBS ( Life Technologies - 16000 - 044 ) and 100 units / ml antibiotic and antimycotic solution ( A - 5955 , Sigma ) . During the experiments , cells were kept within the bio - heater set up ( Asylum Instruments ) at 37 0 C temperature to maintain a healthy state for a longer period ( up to 4 hours ) . All experiments use the same consistent media composition , confluence ( 40 % - 60 % ) and environmental conditions to minimize the effects of external environment on cells . 3 . 2 . Polyacrylamide Gel Preparation The polyacrylamide ( PAM ) gels are prepared from the stocks of 40 % acrylamide ( A8887 , Sigma ) and 2 % bis - acrylamide ( M7279 , Sigma ) solution . Two PAM gels of different stiffness are prepared by varying relative concentrations of monomer acrylamide and crosslinker bis - acrylamide [ 40 ] . Polymerization is initiated by adding 1 / 100 th by volume of 10 % ammonium persulfate ( A3678 , Sigma ) and 1 / 1000 th by volume of TEMED ( T9281 , Sigma ) . 300μl of the mixture is poured on a coverslip and it is covered by another coverslip to avoid oxygen contact during polymerization [ 41 - 42 ] . This leads to the formation of uniform thickness gel and after the complete polymerization , gels are stored in DDH 2 o Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

The height of gel is estimated using an optical microscope by focusing first on the glass surface and subsequently to the top of gel surface while recording the movement of the objective . 3 . 3 . Experimental Setup and Approach AFM indentation is done in conjunction with optical imaging which allows us to control the indentation location precisely . An Asylum MFP - 3D AFM ( Oxford Instruments ) mounted on Olympus IX71 inverted microscope is used for conducting the experiments . The AFM has decoupled x - y scanner of 90x90µm 2 and z - piezo of 40µm range respectively . Indentation experiments are conducted with cantilever of stiffness k = 0 . 02N / m ( TR400PB ) . The precise values of cantilever spring constants are determined by thermal method [ 43 ] . Probe deflection sensitivity is calibrated on the hard surface of coverslip in a liquid medium to establish a relation between voltage and deflection . Samples are prepared 24hrs before the experiment . The coverslip is washed twice with 1XPBS and it is fixed within the bio - heater chamber using high vacuum silicone grease ( Z273554 , SIGMA ) . The chamber is filled with 1 . 5ml of media and maintained at 37 0 C temperature . After every experiment , the AFM cantilevers are cleaned in acetone , and then in absolute ethanol for 15min . Finally , the probe is exposed to UV ( 250 nm ) radiation for 20 min to remove organic matter attached to the cantilever surface . AFM provides deflection ( d ) and Z - sensor data ( z ) . Deflection data is converted into force ‘F’ using Hook’s Law ( eqn ( 12 ) ) , where k c is the spring constant of the cantilever . The first point of tip - sample interaction is known as a contact point ( z 0 , d 0 ) , and it is used to find the indentation depth , eqn ( 13 ) . Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

The substrate effect will be negligible while indenting on thick homogeneous polyacrylamide gel sample and over the nucleus region of the cell . The average properties estimated from both loading and unloading curves by using the present model are compared along with the well - known standard models [ 20 , 25 ] . Here two different tests are conducted with 0 . 5 and 1nN trigger force values at 0 . 5μm / s velocity . Further , the effectiveness of correction factor in the new contact model is tested on an isotropic homogeneous gel of different thicknesses ( provided in the appendix ) and the cellular surface of varying thickness . Here , a cell is progressively indented from periphery to the nucleus region with an indentation force of 2 . 5nN at 3μm / s velocity , where sample thickness varies from 0 to h max . Equally spaced 60 indentation curves are taken along a length of 20µm from the periphery to the center of the cell . The substantial influence of bottom substrate effect and spatial heterogeneity in the cellular material can be captured through this single line force map experiment . 4 . DATA ANALYSIS 4 . 1 . Cell Height ( h ) , Contact & Detachment Point Estimation The data analysis needs the local thickness of cell ( h ) , the location of the contact point ( a ) and detachment point ( c ) , as shown in Fig . 1 .

Sitikantha Roy , Applied Mechanics Department , IIT Delhi Assigned Paper No : Bio - 16 - 1334 13 the other taken on the nearby hard substrate [ 44 ] . Here height or thickness of the sample is the ‘z’ distance between contact points of these two curves . The contact point ( z 0 , d 0 ) on the loading curve and detachment point ( z d , d d ) on the unloading curve are required to separate the contact domain data from pre - contact and post - detachment data . Precisely locating the contact point is necessary for the correct evaluation of properties [ 28 ] . The initial estimate of the contact point is made by monitoring the sign change in the consecutive force values , starting from the maximum value of force in the data . The point at which , force changes its sign ( + ve or repulsive to - ve or attractive ) for the first time is used as an initial guess of the contact point . Subsequently , a regression analysis is carried out to calculate the R 2 value . The iterations are done by updating the data successively by adding a finite number of new data points in the neighborhood of the previous estimate of the contact point . This process is repeated until a final set of ( F 0 , δ 0 ) is obtained for which R 2 value is maximum . In most of the cases , tip - sample detachment is clearly visible in an unloading curve . Its exact location with respect to the contact point is uncertain , this happens due to the variations in the adhesive behavior of different samples ( as shown fig . A2 ) . In the absence of adhesion , the location of detachment point is detected through a similar approach as adopted earlier for the detection of the contact point . 4 . 2 . Bottom Substrate Effect In force map studies on the cell surface , a pre - fixed indentation force is applied on a selected region of a sample , where sample thickness can vary greatly ( h = 1 to 10μm ) . In this case , indentation from tapered tips can cause large transverse strains ( δ / h = 10 - 90 % ) . Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Sitikantha Roy , Applied Mechanics Department , IIT Delhi Assigned Paper No : Bio - 16 - 1334 14 A steep increase in force values with negligible change in indentation depth can be seen in obtained F - δ curves , generally at δ / h > 80 % ( Fig . A2 ) . A large deviation in elastic properties can be observed because of this sample stiffening due to bottom substrate effect ( BSE ) [ 12 - 16 ] . In such cases , data is filtered and affected portion is truncated by monitoring the relative changes in indentation depth values . The part of the F - δ curve that fits well to the contact model equation is used in the analysis [ 18 ] . The present model assumes that there is a continuous increase in contact area and force during loading . Also , contact area as well as surface energy decreases smoothly in unloading curve . So , indentation data showing intermediate breaks or steep detachments are not included in the analysis . If unloading curve shows zig - zag or non - smooth detachment , curve fit to experimental data cannot follow the exact detachment process and leads to high residuals . The non - linear least square analysis of experimental data is done by fitting the present contact model ( eqn 7 & 11 ) ) using the Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm in Matlab - 14 [ 45 ] to estimate the optimal values of E and γ a simultaneously . The coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) , examination of residuals , and comparison of the model generated curves with experimental data are followed to check the goodness of fit , as shown in Fig . 1 . The F - δ data with R 2 > 0 . 95 are only considered in evaluating the mean values of elastic and adhesion properties . Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Validation and Comparison The motivation of the present study was to develop a generalized AFM indentation model based on contact mechanics which will eventually address the following questions : such as , how to overcome the bottom substrate effect in thin samples ? How to analyze the adhesion affected indentation curves ? What is a better way of representing the adhesive property of a sample ? Can we measure the material stiffness and non - specific adhesive nature of a sample in a single experiment ? In our attempt to address the above questions , we have developed a new contact model and it is tested on different samples of variable thickness . The new model has its origin from classical Sneddon’s model ( 1965 ) [ 20 ] and Sirghi et al . ( 2006 ) [ 25 ] . In these models , the sample is assumed to be infinitely thick i . e . bottom substrate effect is negligible . Therefore , in the absence of it , the measured properties from new model ( Eqn 7 & 11 ) must be comparable to the above - mentioned models . To validate the new model , indentation data is collected from uniformly thick homogeneous polyacrylamide gel ( h≈200μm ) and from nucleus region of finite thickness cell ( h = 11 . 4±1 . 8μm ) where the substrate effect is assumed to be negligible . Equation ( 7 ) and eqn . ( 11 ) are used for analyzing the loading and unloading data . Fig . 2 ( A ) shows the comparison of the mean elastic modulus of thick gel extracted from unloading curves with and without considering the finite thickness . It is seen that addition of finite thickness into model has negligible influence on mean properties and its effect on mean value is less than 1 % ( paired t - test , P < 0 . 001 ) . Both polyacrylamide gels of different stiffness lead to Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Sitikantha Roy , Applied Mechanics Department , IIT Delhi Assigned Paper No : Bio - 16 - 1334 16 the same conclusion . This is because transverse deformation ( δ / h < 0 . 005 ) is too small to invite any substrate effect . In the case of MCF - 7 cells where transverse deformations were considerable high ( δ / h ≈15 % ) , relieving infinite thickness assumption showed a variation in mean elastic property up to 8 % for 0 . 5nN and 12 % for 1nN indentation force studies ( P < 0 . 001 ) , fig . 2 ( B and C ) . In the case of cells , this magnitude can further vary because it is a function of applied indentation force and cell height . Assuming cells as infinitely thick in Sneddon’s model leads to a significant over - estimation of elastic properties . In both 0 . 5 and 1nN indentation experiments , the measured elastic property increased with the increase in indentation depth . The depth dependent increase in material properties in the absence of bottom substrate effect might be due to heterogeneity in the transverse direction . From above experiments , it is clear that at very low δ / h ratio , properties extracted from the present model are consistent with prior models which assume sample as infinitely thick . To test the present model’s effectiveness in curbing the substrate effect , we have tested it on different thickness isotropic homogeneous gel ( results are discussed in the appendix ) and on varying thickness region of a cell , as explained below . 5 . 2 . Application on varying thickness region of sample Here indentations are done progressively from cell periphery ( δ / h≈1 ) to nucleus region ( δ / h < 1 ) by applying 2 . 5nN indentation force at 3μm / s velocity . From the obtained curves , cell topography and indentation depth profile are created , as shown in Fig . 3 ( A ) . These profiles will help in comparing elastic ( E ) and adhesion property ( γ a ) distribution . Fig . 3 ( B ) shows a variation of strain ( δ / h ) along the indentation path . In this test , adhesion and bottom substrate influenced unloading curves are analyzed and are presented in Fig . 3 ( C Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Significant corrections are present in the zone x = 0 to 10um , where cell height is h = 0 to 4um ( δ / h > 50 % ) . Uniform values of elastic modulus in nucleus zone indicate the presence of material homogeneity in that region . Q . S Li et al . [ 2 ] showed that MCF - 7 cells lack dense actin network due to malignancy and has a sparsely distributed actin network at the bottom region of the cell . In Fig . 3 ( C ) at x = 4 to 10μm region , we can see higher values of elastic modulus and heterogeneity in the non - nucleus region . This might be due to the presence of stiff actin network and other organelles . The effectiveness of new model can be clearly seen near the peripheral region where substrate correction terms become dominant in eqn ( 11 ) . Similar studies are conducted on different thickness soft homogeneous gel sample and it is found that Sneddon’s model [ 18 ] overestimates the elastic property in the thin sample significantly , results are shown in the appendix . The present model eliminates this effect to provide a more accurate elastic map of cells . 5 . 3 . Adhesion Measurement In most of the studies , the adhesion property of a cell or soft material is represented by peak negative force seen in the unloading curve [ 3 , 6 , 9 , 17 , 46 ] . A major limitation of this representation is that it assumes adhesion as a single detachment event . Also , this observed peak - adhesion - force is a function of the contact area . The fact is , adhesion is not a single detachment event , rather it is a process of breaking non - specific bonds formed between tip - cell membrane contacts . A more realistic and better representation of observed adhesion must be material specific and should be independent of contact area . Therefore , in the present study , the adhesion property is evaluated by analyzing a complete detachment process and expressed in terms of surface energy per unit area , γ a Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Sitikantha Roy , Applied Mechanics Department , IIT Delhi Assigned Paper No : Bio - 16 - 1334 18 ( J / m 2 ) . Eqn ( 11 ) is used to simultaneously evaluate both elastic and adhesion property . Fig . 3 ( D ) shows a variation of adhesion parameter ( γ a ) on the cell surface . The overall distribution of adhesion parameter on cell surface indicates the inherent heterogeneity of cellular material . The uniform values of γ a near - nucleus region indicate the presence of local homogeneity . Large variation between corrected and uncorrected γ a values in the peripheral region of the cell is because of substrate effect . We have also observed that E ( Young’s Modulus ) is more sensitive to substrate correction than γ a , as shown in fig . 3 ( E ) . There is not much literature available to compare the adhesion measure γ a of MCF - 7 cells . The mean value of γ a of MCF - 7 cells is 8 . 5X10 - 05 J / m 2 , this value is obtained from analyzing the data extracted by applying 1nN indentation force at 0 . 5µm / s velocity . Using thermodynamic approach , an approximate density of non - specific bonds formed between tip and cell membrane can be estimated using equation 𝛾 𝑎 = ( 𝑛 𝐴 𝑐 ⁄ ) ∗ 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 [ 18 , 47 - 48 ] , where ‘n / A c ’ is number of bonds per unit contact area , ‘k B ’ is Boltzmann constant and ‘T’ is the absolute temperature . Using experimentally found mean γ a , it can be shown that MCF - 7 cells form approximately 19 , 850 bonds / µm 2 within the contact area , at 37 0 C temperature . This indicates the presence of large number of weak , short range , non - specific adhesion forces on the sample surface . 5 . 4 . Limitations and future scope There are some limitations in the present model and analysis . Such as 1 ) the current model does not include the corrections due to non - uniform pyramidal tip geometry . 2 ) It is assumed that tip - curvature effect on measured properties is negligible . As it’s effect is limited to the indentation depth of the order of tip apex diameter ( ≈40 - 60nm ) [ 49 ] . In Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

While other assumptions like homogeneous and linear elasticity remain within the model . 4 ) Present model assumes that sample is well bonded to the bottom substrate . For non - bonded sample studies , the evaluated factor 1 . 7795 in eqn ( 11 ) will change to 1 . 388 throughout . 5 ) It is assumed that there is no change in cell properties during probing and viscous drag effect on the cantilever is negligible . 6 ) From the adopted height measurement method , it is difficult to measure accurate height in certain cases . For example , cells within the monolayer or thin films where the substrate is not accessible . In these cases , substrate tilts may influence height measurement . Some other optical measurement techniques from combined confocal - AFM may be adopted . 6 . CONCLUSIONS In the present work we have developed a simple closed form expression of a contact model 1 ) which is an extension of classical Sneddon’s model and relieves two major assumptions : infinite sample thickness , and non - adhesive nature . 2 ) An asymptotical expression of the “correction factor” is derived to nullify the bottom substrate effect in the measured properties . The provided correction factor is tested on a wide range of samples with varying thickness . 3 ) The adhesion property of a sample is expressed in terms of surface energy per unit area instead of the commonly adopted peak value of adhesion force . The present model can be used for more accurate estimate of elastic and adhesion maps of heterogeneous material like a biological cell . 4 ) The developed Journal of Biomechanical Engineering .

Sitikantha Roy , Applied Mechanics Department , IIT Delhi Assigned Paper No : Bio - 16 - 1334 27 2 ) Validation of Present model on Different Thickness Gel Sample In this study , Present and Sneddon’s contact model are tested on loading curves of indentation data taken from different thickness polyacrylamide gel , shown in fig . A3 . Because of the linear material assumption , we can uniquely find a single ‘E’ value for every F - δ point independently [ 30 ] and it is represented as ‘E δ ’ . It is non - dimensionalized by dividing elastic modulus ( E w ) extracted from fitting whole F - δ data using present contact model . We have used same contact point for the analyzing data with Sneddon and Present contact model . Analysis of indentation curves taken on samples of 4 different thicknesses where δ max / h is varying from 14 % to 90 % is shown in table - A1 . The observed initial fluctuation in the E δ / E w values is due to the absence of firm contact between tip - sample at the initial stage of indentation . It is necessary to indent 300 - 400nm depth irrespective of sample height to capture true material property . The ratio E δ / E w remains fairly stable and straight after this initial uncertain region , which is expected in an isotropic homogeneous gel sample . In thin samples , the deviation between E δ / E w values predicted by both models increased continuously and at δ / h > 90 % this error was more than 30 % . This study indicates that Sneddon’s model is inappropriate for mechanical property characterization of thin soft samples because the assumption of infinite thickness adds significant errors to the evaluated property . From the graphs in table - 1 , it becomes clear that commonly followed experimental barrier of 10 % transverse strain can be safely crossed using present linear model and in an isotropic material , it can accurately correct the substrate effect up to 75 % of δ / h .
