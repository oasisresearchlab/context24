Exon 4 - encoded sequence is a major determinant of cytotox - icity of apolipoprotein L1 . Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 309 : C22 – C37 , 2015 . First published April 29 , 2015 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpcell . 00384 . 2014 . — The apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene ( APOL1 ) product is toxic to kidney cells , and its G1 and G2 alleles are strongly associated with increased risk for kidney disease progression in African Americans . Variable penetrance of the G1 and G2 risk alleles highlights the signiﬁcance of additional factors that trigger or modify the progres - sion of disease . In this regard , the effect of alternative splicing in the absence or presence of G1 or G2 alleles is unknown . In this study we investigated whether alternative splicing of non - G1 , non - G2 APOL1 ( APOL1 G0 ) affects its biological activity . Among seven APOL1 exons , exons 2 and 4 are differentially expressed in major transcripts . We found that , in contrast to APOL1 splice variants B3 or C , variants A and B1 demonstrate strong toxicity in human embryonic kidney ( HEK293T ) cells . Subsequently , we established that exon 4 is a major determinant of toxicity of variants A and B1 and that extracellular release of these variants is dispensable for their cytotoxicity . Although only variants A and B1 induced nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) , a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy , exon 4 - positive and - negative APOL1 variants stimulated perinuclear accumulation of unprocessed autophagosomes . Knock - down of endogenous TFEB did not attenuate APOL1 cytotoxicity , indicating that nuclear translocation of TFEB is dispensable for APOL1 toxicity . Our ﬁndings that a human podocyte cell line ex - presses exon 4 - positive and - negative APOL1 transcripts suggest that these variants may play a differential role in podocyte pathology . In summary , we have identiﬁed exon 4 as a major determinant of APOL1 G0 cytotoxicity . apolipoprotein L1 ; autophagy ; endocytosis ; cytotoxicity ; RNA splic - ing TWO CODING VARIANTS of the apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene ( APOL1 ) have been recently attributed to the increased risk of developing nondiabetic kidney disease in individuals of recent African ancestry ( 10 , 46 ) . These risk variants , termed G1 ( S342G and I384M substitutions ) and G2 ( N388 and Y389 deletions ) , localize in the COOH terminus of the protein encoded by exon 7 and have risen to high frequency in sub - Saharan African populations by providing resistance against the blood parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and , possibly , other pathogens ( 32 , 47 ) . Although one APOL1 risk allele is usually sufﬁcient to protect against this parasite infection , two copies of any of the APOL1 risk alleles predis - pose the carriers to kidney disease . Because functional APOL1 protein is found only in humans , gorillas , and baboons ( 42 ) , it has been suggested that APOL1 is dispensable for normal kidney function but may have an auxiliary function . Indeed , a nonessential role for APOL1 in humans has been conﬁrmed by identiﬁcation of individuals that carry homozygous APOL1 null alleles without detectable deleterious effects on kidney function ( 17 ) . Although the functions of no - risk variant [ wild - type ( G0 ) ] APOL1 proteins remain unknown , recent studies using in vitro ( 26 , 34 ) and in vivo ( 45 ) models have demon - strated increased cytotoxicity of APOL1 G1 or G2 alleles compared with the APOL1 G0 allele . However , the overall disease penetrance , even with two risk alleles , is low , suggest - ing the importance of epistatic and environmental interaction effects ( 4 , 6 , 34 ) . The most prominent example is HIV infec - tion , which , when untreated , increases the risk of progressive kidney disease in individuals with two APOL1 risk alleles from (cid:2) 4 % lifetime risk to (cid:3) 50 % lifetime risk ( 24 ) . Importantly , this form of HIV - associated kidney disease [ HIV - associated ne - phropathy ( HIVAN ) ] is virtually absent in HIV - infected indi - viduals without APOL1 risk alleles ( 3 ) . Alternative splicing of mRNA is a highly regulated process that increases proteome complexity by synthesis of proteins often with novel biological functions ( 21 ) . Thus , epistatic or environmental factors may modify the APOL1 splicing pattern , resulting in alternatively spliced variants with potentially dif - ferent pathobiological effects . The APOL1 gene is encoded by seven exons ( 8 ) , which can be differentially spliced , usually by exclusion of exon 2 or 4 , to encode three major APOL1 splice variants , A , B , and C ( Fig . 1 ) . Although the prevalence of different APOL1 splice variants is unknown , the most com - mon , variant A , is encoded by exons 1 and 3 – 7 . The splice variant B1 is encoded by exons 1 – 7 , while variant B3 was reported to lack exon 4 , as reported in an abstract presented in 2014 at the 10th International Podocyte Conference in Freiburg , Germany ( 48 ) . Variant C is similar to variant A but lacks exon 4 and is encoded by exons 1 , 3 , and 5 – 7 . With the exception of untranslated exon 1 , all exons are fully or partly translated . Since the G1 and G2 alleles are located in the last and the largest exon 7 , all APOL1 splicing variants will include these mutations , if present . However , the function of APOL1 proteins encoded by alternatively spliced APOL1 variants in the absence or presence of G1 or G2 risk alleles is unknown . Interestingly , exons 2 , 3 , and 4 contribute to the putative NH 2 - terminal signal peptide involved in endoplasmic reticu - lum targeting , membrane trafﬁcking , and protein secretion . Thus it is likely that APOL1 variants B3 and C , which do not carry a canonical signal peptide because of the absence of exon 4 , may display different intracellular localization , processing , Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : W .

Indeed , it was recently reported that APOL1 variant B3 localizes to mitochondria , although its function there was not determined ( 48 ) . We previously showed that APOL1 splice variant A stimulates endocytosis and lysosomal biogenesis by promoting nuclear localization of transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) and expression of several TFEB target genes ( 44 ) , suggesting that APOL1 - mediated abnormalities in the endolysosomal pathway may contribute to aberrant autophagy and toxicity ( 26 ) . Interestingly , the proinﬂammatory cytokines IFN (cid:4) and TNF (cid:5) , known to potently stimulate expression of a major APOL1 variant , variant A ( 33 , 34 , 51 ) , also increase the levels of alternatively spliced variants B and C ( 34 ) . However , the pathobiological signiﬁcance of these observations is un - clear . In the present study we examined the effects of different APOL1 splice variants on cell toxicity and downstream path - ways including autophagy . We have found that exon 4 is a major determinant of cytotoxicity of APOL1 splice variants A and B1 but is dispensable for the inhibition of autophagosome maturation demonstrated by all tested APOL1 splice variants . We propose that exon 4 is a major determinant of APOL1 toxicity , an effect that could potentially be fortiﬁed by G1 or G2 risk alleles . Importantly , we showed that a human podocyte cell line expresses exon 4 - positive and - negative APOL1 tran - scripts . MATERIALS AND METHODS APOL1 Expression Vectors and Mutagenesis APOL1 cDNA corresponding to a splice variant A ( NM _ 003661 ) was obtained in pCMV6 - XL5 vector ( OriGene ) . All APOL1 variants were expressed from pCMV6 - XL5 . APOL1 variant B1 ( NM _ 145343 , Geneart , Life Technologies ) was PCR - ampliﬁed from a provided vector using primers containing Eco RI and Xba I restriction sites ( underlined ) : 5 = A TCG GAA TTC GCC ATG AGA TTC AAA AGC CAC 3 = ( forward Eco RI primer ) and 5 = A GAT TCT AGA TCA CAG TTC TTG GTC CGC CT 3 = ( reverse Xba I primer ) . The PCR product corresponding to full - length APOL1 cDNA was cloned into Eco RI and Xba I sites of pCMV6 - XL5 . The open reading frame of APOL1 genes was modiﬁed by PCR with myc epitope ( MASMQKLISEEDL ) separated from the APOL1 COOH - terminal sequence QADQEL with a linker composed of two amino acid residues proline and glycine . Myc epitope and APOL1 deletion mutants were created using the QuickChange II site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . APOL1 variant C ( NM _ 001136541 ) was generated by deletion of amino acids 32 – 49 ( corresponding to a fragment encoded by exon 4 ) from APOL1 variant A using a set of two complementary primers : 5 = GA GTC TCT GTC CTC TGC ATC TGG GTG CAA CAA AAC GTT CCA AGT GGG 3 = and 5 = CCC ACT TGG AAC GTT TTG TTG CAC CCA GAT GCA GAG GAC AGA GAC TC 3 = . The DNA sequences of APOL1 constructs were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing ( GenePass , Nashville , TN ) . Tissue Culture , Treatments , and DNA and siRNA Transfections Human conditionally immortalized glomerular podocytes , AB8 / 13 ( 39 ) , were cultured at 33°C in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , gentamicin ( 50 (cid:6) g / ml ) , and insulin - transfer - rin - selenium ( ITS , Life Technologies ) . For differentiation of podo - cytes , cells were transferred to 37°C for 7 – 10 days to inactivate temperature - sensitive SV40 large T antigen . For induction of APOL1 expression , differentiated podocytes were treated for 24 h with IFN (cid:4) ( 50 ng / ml ; Peprotech ) ( 34 ) . HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbec - co’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and gentamicin ( 50 (cid:6) g / ml ) . The cells were transfected using polyeth - ylenimine ( PEI , 25 , 000 mol wt ; Polysciences ) , PolyFect ( Qiagen ) , or Lipofectamine ( Life Technologies ) . Transfections were performed on cells seeded at 5 (cid:7) 10 5 per well and growing on collagen - coated six - well plates using a total of 2 (cid:6) g of DNA per well . APOL1 plasmid DNA was used at 1 (cid:6) g per transfection . Total DNA in transfections was balanced with pcDNA3 . 1 . For siRNA transfections , HEK293T cells were seeded in six - well plates at 1 . 2 (cid:7) 10 5 per well . Transfection with Silencer Select predesigned siRNAs against autophagy protein 5 ( Atg5 ) siRNA , TFEB siRNA , or control siRNA ( Life Technologies ) was performed on day 1 and repeated on day 2 using 20 nM ﬁnal concentration of each siRNA and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Life Technologies ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . After 24 h , the cells were transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 or APOL1 expression vector ( 44 ) , and after an additional 24 h , cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and an equal amount of lysate proteins ( 20 – 50 (cid:6) g ) was separated on 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting for expression of APOL1 ( HPA018885 antibody , Sigma - Aldrich ) , Atg5 ( Cell Signaling ) , and actin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . For analysis of TFEB knockdown , total cellu - lar RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen ) , and cDNA was generated from 1 (cid:6) g of RNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Bio - Rad ) . Expression of TFEB , APOL1 , and GAPDH RNAs was analyzed by real - time PCR ( CFX96 , Bio - Rad ) using sets of speciﬁc primers ( OriGene ) . TFEB and APOL1 RNA levels were normalized against GAPDH RNA . Analysis of APOL1 Splice Variant Transcripts in Human Podocytes AB8 / 13 podocytes differentiated for 7 days in six - well plates were left untreated ( control ) or treated with IFN (cid:4) ( 50 ng / ml ) . After 24 h , total RNA was isolated ( Qiagen ) , and 1 (cid:6) g of RNA was reverse - transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Bio - Rad ) . cDNA volume was adjusted with nuclease - free water to 150 (cid:6) l , and 3 (cid:6) l of cDNA were subjected to a two - step PCR using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase ( Life Technologies ) in a ﬁnal volume of 25 (cid:6) l . PCR cycling conditions for the ﬁrst and second PCRs were as follows : 95°C for 1 min followed by 18 cycles of 95°C for 30 s , 60°C for 30 s , and 72°C for 30 s . Primers for the ﬁrst PCR were designed to anneal to exons 1 and 6 and to amplify fragments of all major splice variants of APOL1 . Sequences of the PCR primers used in the ﬁrst PCR were as follows : 5 = - AGAACAGCTGGATCTTGCTCAG - 3 ( exon 1 for - ward ) and 5 = - GTTCCAGGCCTCATTATCAGTCAG - 3 = ( exon 6 re - verse ) . In the second PCR , 1 (cid:6) l of the ﬁrst PCR product was ampliﬁed in a ﬁnal volume of 25 (cid:6) l using conditions described for the ﬁrst PCR and primer sets designed to discriminately amplify variants with and without exon 4 . Sequences of primers used in the second PCR were as follows : 5 = - AGCTGCTTTGCTGAGAGTCTCTG - 3 = ( exon 3 for - ward ) and 5 = - GAGTAGCAGATTCTGTGTGCTCAC - 3 = ( exon 6 re - verse ) . The predicted size of the second PCR product for exon 4 - negative APOL1 is 196 bp and that for exon 4 - containing APOL1 is 250 bp . PCR products were resolved on 3 % agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide . DNA bands were excised , and DNA was extracted using the QIAquick gel extraction kit ( Qiagen ) . Isolated DNA was cloned directly into pJET vector using the CloneJET PCR cloning kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) , and ligation products were transformed into MAX Efﬁciency DH5 (cid:5) competent cells ( Life Technologies ) . Plasmid DNAs were isolated from bacterial colonies using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit ( Qiagen ) , and PCR DNA inserts were sequenced using sequencing primers provided with the CloneJET kit . The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the PCR primers used to amplify cDNA from podocytes were initially tested on cDNA prepared from HEK293T cells transfected with DNA plasmids expressing APOL1 splice vari - ants . PCR primers ampliﬁed products with predicted sizes . Cytotoxicity Assays Lactate dehydrogenase assay . HEK293T cells , cultured on six - well plates , were transfected with 1 (cid:6) g each of control pcDNA or indicated C23 EXON 4 DETERMINES APOL1 CYTOTOXICITY AJP - Cell Physiol • doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpcell . 00384 . 2014 • www . ajpcell . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 1 on J u l y 9 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p c e ll . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m APOL1 constructs using PolyFect ( Qiagen ) . After 5 h , the media were replaced with DMEM containing 2 % FCS , and the cells were incu - bated overnight . Where indicated , culture media were supplemented with a mixture of lysosomal protease inhibitors and E64d and pep - statin A ( both at 10 (cid:6) g / ml ; Tocris Bioscience ) . In an alternative approach , at 6 h after transfection , culture media were supplemented with 50 (cid:6) M chloroquine diphosphate ( CLQ ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , a lyso - somotropic agent that prevents lysosomal acidiﬁcation and inhibits function of lysosomal enzymes . After 24 h , culture media were harvested and centrifuged for 15 min at low speed to remove cell debris , and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) activity was quantitated using a Cytoscan - LDH cytotoxicity assay ( G - Biosciences ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Enzyme activity of LDH was assayed quantitatively by measurement of absorbance at 490 nm using a microplate reader . Cytotoxicity was expressed as a percentage of LDH released in experimental samples ( subtracted for LDH present in 2 % FCS culture medium ) relative to LDH released by totally lysed cells ( set for 100 % ) . Propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 staining . Cells were incu - bated for 10 min at 37°C with fresh culture media supplemented with 1 (cid:6) M Hoechst 33342 stain and 5 (cid:6) M propidium iodide ( PI ; Life Technologies ) , washed twice with PBS , and ﬁxed for 15 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The cells were washed with PBS and then imaged by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Autophagy Assays Monitoring autophagy by ﬂuorescence microscopy . HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP - microtubule - associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( LC3 ) or GFP - LC3 (cid:8) G ( GFP - LC3 G120A ) ( 43 ) , a negative control defective in conjugation with phosphatidylethano - lamine ( PE ) , in combination with vectors expressing APOL1 mutants or splice variants . The cells were cultured for 24 h in nonstarving conditions ( 10 % FCS ) , and formation of GFP ﬂuorescent puncta ( corresponding to autophagosomes ) was observed under ﬂuorescence microscopy . In cells transfected with GFP - LC3 , only infrequent GFP puncta were detected in the cytoplasm , and most GFP - LC3 localized to the nucleus . Analysis of autophagosome maturation . Autophagosome matura - tion was analyzed by confocal microscopy in cells transfected with a tandem ﬂuorescent monomeric red ﬂuorescent protein ( mRFP ) - en - hanced GFP ( EGFP ) - LC3 construct ( tfLC3 ) . Because mRFP is more stable than EGFP in acidic conditions , effective fusion of autophago - somes with lysosomes can be traced by accumulation of red - ﬂuores - cent puncta ( autolysosomes ) as opposed to yellow puncta , which mark unprocessed autophagosomes ( or fusion intermediates with reduced acidiﬁcation ) . Biochemical assays to monitor accumulation of lipidated GFP - LC3 II . Lysates from cells transfected with GFP - LC3 and pcDNA3 . 1 ( control ) or APOL1 expression vectors were resolved on 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel , and faster - migrating PE - conjugated GFP - LC3 II ( which labels autophagosomes ) and slower - migrating cytoplasmic GFP - LC3 I were separated and detected by immunoblotting using anti - GFP antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Analysis of autophagic ﬂux . Autophagic ﬂux was analyzed 24 h after transfection by exposure of the cells fo r 3 h to 100 (cid:6) M CLQ ( 11 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , which is known to inhibit lysosome acidiﬁcation and fusion with autophagosomes . As a result , accumulation of unpro - cessed autophagosomes could be monitored by ﬂuorescence micros - copy ( GFP - LC3 puncta ) or by immunoblotting ( GFP - LC3 II ) . Permeabilization of Cells With Saponin At 24 h after transfection , HEK293T cells were rinsed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % saponin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS at room temperature for a total of 10 min ( two 5 - min washes with PBS - saponin ) . After removal of saponin , the cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer , protein lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation , and equal amounts of protein ( 20 (cid:6) g / lane ) from control and saponin - treated cells were separated on 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel ( 44 ) and ana - lyzed for expression of APOL1 , GAPDH , and actin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Endocytosis Assays Transferrin - Alexa Fluor 594 uptake . HEK293T cells were incu - bated for 18 h in a complete medium with 80 (cid:6) M dynasore ( Tocris Bioscience ) ( 29 ) in 0 . 1 % DMSO or 0 . 1 % DMSO alone and then for 30 min at 37°C with 5 (cid:6) g / ml transferrin - Alexa Fluor 594 ( Life Technologies ) . The cells were washed and then ﬁxed in 4 % parafor - maldehyde for 15 min , washed in PBS , and imaged on a ﬂuorescence microscope . DQ Green BSA uptake . The cells pretreated with dynasore as described above were incubated for 4 h at37°C with 250 (cid:6) g / ml DQ Green BSA ( self - quenched ﬂuorescent dye BODIPY FL derivatives of BSA ; Life Technologies ) and then chased for 90 min in media without DQ Green BSA . DQ Green BSA acquires ﬂuorescence only Fig . 1 . Apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) splice variant schematics , terminology , and expression . The major APOL1 splice variants are cataloged in the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) database . Splice variant A ( v . A ) is encoded by transcript variant 1 ( NM _ 003661 ) and contains exons 1 and 3 – 7 [ protein composed of 398 amino acids ( aa ) ] ; variant B1 ( v . B1 ) is encoded by transcript variant 2 ( NM _ 145343 ) and contains exons 1 – 7 ( 414 aa ) ; variant B3 ( v . B3 ) is similar to variant B1 but lacks exon 4 ( 396 aa ) ; variant C is encoded by transcript variant 4 ( NM _ 001136541 ) and contains exons 1 , 3 , and 5 – 7 ( 380 aa ) . A : major APOL1 variants encoded by different transcript splice variants . Amino acid numbering is shown as follows : the ﬁrst translated amino acid is assigned the number 1 in the B1 variant , and amino acids for all splice variants , as well as engineered constructs , are then assigned numbers in relation to this amino acid . Thus the ﬁrst amino acid number in variant A is 17 . According to the published NCBI and Ensembl data , aa 10 ( Leu ) is encoded by the 2 last nucleotides of exon 2 ( TT ) and the ﬁrst nucleotide ( G ) of exon 3 ; aa 31 ( Trp ) is encoded by the last TG ( exon 3 ) and ﬁrst G ( exon 4 ) ; aa 49 ( Arg ) is encoded by the last AG ( exon 4 ) and ﬁrst G ( exon 5 ) ; aa 79 ( Glu ) is encoded by the last G ( exon 5 ) and ﬁrst AG ( exon 6 ) ; aa 121 ( Arg ) is encoded by the last AG ( exon 6 ) and ﬁrst G ( exon 7 ) . Untranslated exons or parts of exons are symbolized by white boxes ; exons encoding for a putative signal peptide are shown in green and translated exons in blue . Exons ( boxes ) and introns ( horizontal lines ) are shown not in scale . B : APOL1 splice variants A , B1 , B3 , and C were constructed from APOL1 cDNA and , thus , include only the indicated exons without introns . Deletion mutants of variants A and B1 are also shown . Deletion of aa 17 – 43 from APOL1 variant A , denoted v . A ( d . 17 – 43 ) , creates APOL1 variant A without a signal peptide . Deletion of aa 1 – 16 from variant B1 [ v . B1 ( d . 1 – 16 ) ] produces variant A . Deletion of aa 32 – 49 from variant B1 produces v . B1 ( d . 32 – 49 ) , which is identical to variant B3 . Deletion of aa 1 – 16 from v . B1 ( d . 32 – 49 ) produces v . B1 ( d . 1 – 16 , 32 – 49 ) , similar to variant C . APOL1 variant C was created by deletion of aa 32 – 49 from original variant A [ denoted v . A ( d . 32 – 49 ) ] and also by deletion of aa 1 – 16 and 32 – 49 from the original APOL1 variant B1 [ denoted v . B1 ( d . 1 – 16 , 32 – 49 ) ] . Similarly , in addition to the original variant A , a variant with exon composition identical to that of variant A was created by deletion of aa 1 – 16 from variant B1 and is denoted v . B1 ( d . 1 – 16 ) . C : amino acid sequences encoded by exons 2 – 7 of APOL1 . All exons are translated only in APOL1 variant B1 . Alternating exons are shown in blue and black . Amino acid residues shown in red are encoded by nucleotides from neighboring exons . D : APOL1 splice variants were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and analyzed by Western blotting . APOL1 v . A ( d . 17 – 43 ) and variant B1 migrate in a SDS - polyacrylamide gel as proteins with apparent molecular size expected for APOL1 variant A . APOL1 v . B1 ( d . 32 – 49 ) ( same as variant B3 ) migrates as a doublet , which may result from posttranslational modiﬁcation ( s ) or proteolytic processing , as suggested elsewhere ( 13 ) . E : aberrant migration of the APOL1 proteins in a SDS - polyacrylamide gel does not result from proteolytic processing at the COOH terminus . A similar pattern of expression of APOL1 protein variants was detected using anti - APOL1 or anti - myc antibodies ( all APOL1 constructs were designed to express a myc tag at the COOH terminus ) .

The cells were washed with PBS and then ﬁxed and imaged on a ﬂuorescence microscope . Confocal Microscopy HEK293T cells were transfected on six - well plates using PolyFect ; at 5 h after transfection , the cells were trypsynized , and a fraction of the cells was seeded in two - well chamber slides ( Lab - Tek II ) pre - coated with collagen . After overnight incubation , the cells were rinsed once with PBS and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature . The cells were washed three times with PBS and then mounted with SlowFade antifade reagent with DAPI ( Life Technologies ) and observed under a laser scanning confocal micro - scope ( Nikon TE2000 ) . APOL1 Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting HEK293T cells were transfected on six - well plates with myc - tagged APOL1 expression constructs using PolyFect . At 5 h after transfection , media were replaced with DMEM containing 2 % FCS . After overnight incubation , culture media and cells were harvested . Culture supernatants ( 2 ml each ) were collected by low - speed cen - trifugation , ﬁltered through 0 . 45 - (cid:6) m syringe ﬁlters , and precleared with Protein A / G PLUS - agarose beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) for 1 h ; then APOL1 - myc was immunoprecipitated overnight using goat anti - myc agarose beads ( Bethyl Laboratories ) at 4°C . The beads were washed ﬁve times with ice - cold 0 . 5 % NP - 40 lysis buffer , boiled for 5 min in Laemmli loading buffer , and centrifuged . Cell lysate proteins in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated proteins released from anti - myc beads were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and trans - ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Bio - Rad ) ( 44 ) . Nitrocellulose - immobilized proteins were detected using the WesternBright ECL system ( Advansta ) . Additional Reagents Expression vectors GFP - LC3 , GFP - LC3 (cid:8) G , mRFP - EGFP - LC3 , and GFP - TFEB were purchased from Addgene . Benzyloxycarbonyl - Val - Ala - Asp ( OMe ) ﬂuoromethylketone ( Z - VAD - FMK ) was pur - chased from Tocris Bioscience . Statistical Analysis All experiments were repeated at least three times . For comparison of mean values between two groups , a Student’s t - test was performed . P (cid:9) 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . RESULTS The NH 2 - Terminal Fragment of APOL1 Encoded by Exon 4 Determines APOL1 Cytotoxicity Among the family of human APOL proteins , only APOL1 has the putative NH 2 - terminal signal peptide ( 35 ) . Three major APOL1 protein splice variants , A , B , and C , are encoded by transcripts generated by different splicing events that involve the small exons 1 – 4 , with exons 5 – 7 present in all transcripts ( Fig . 1 A ) . As a result , APOL1 splice variants differ only in the NH 2 - terminal region , which may affect the integrity of the signal peptide . To investigate whether such modiﬁcations may lead to different cellular functions of APOL1 splice variants , we have generated APOL1 expression vectors encoding sev - eral splice variants of APOL1 ( Fig . 1 B ) . An amino acid sequence encoded by APOL1 exons is presented in Fig . 1 C . Noticeably , APOL1 amino acids 10 , 31 , 49 , 79 , and 121 are encoded by nucleotides from neighboring exons ( Fig . 1 C , shown in red ) . Expression of the APOL1 splice variants , tagged with c - myc at the COOH terminus , was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis using anti - APOL1 and anti - myc antibod - ies ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . We have noticed that APOL1 variant A ( d . 17 – 43 ) and B1 migrate in a SDS - polyacrylamide gel with apparent molecular size expected for APOL1 variant A . In addition , APOL1 variant B3 migrates as a doublet , which may result from posttranslational modiﬁcations or partial proteo - lytic processing , since DNA sequence analysis of the expres - sion vector did not reveal contamination with another APOL1 variant . Although increased cytotoxicity of the risk variants G1 and G2 in the background of the most - studied variant A was reported , cytotoxicity of the wild - type APOL1 G0 variant was also observed ( 26 , 34 , 45 ) . To investigate cytotoxicity of APOL1 splice variants in the absence of G1 or G2 risk mutations , these variants were overexpressed in HEK293T cells , which we found to be highly sensitive to toxic effects of APOL1 . Cells undergoing apoptosis and dead cells were stained simultaneously with the DNA dyes Hoechst 33342 and PI ( 12 ) . Cell - permeable Hoechst 33342 stains con - densed nuclear DNA characteristic for apoptotic cells more brightly than normal chromatin ( 1 ) . In contrast , a nonper - meant PI stains only cells with compromised plasma mem - branes or dead cells . While cells transfected with control pcDNA3 . 1 vector show only a few bright Hoechst / PI - stained cells in the examined area , expression of APOL1 splice variant A or B1 was highly cytotoxic , as shown by a loss of Hoechst - positive cells and an increase in cells brightly stained with Hoechst and PI ( Fig . 2 A ) . Deletion of the ﬁrst 16 amino acid residues from variant B1 , which creates a variant B1 ( d . 1 – 16 ) similar to variant A , did not affect cytotoxicity , suggesting that amino acids 1 – 16 ( en - coded by exon 2 and part of exon 3 ) do not contribute to cytotoxicity of variant B1 . Deletion of an additional frag - ment , amino acids 32 – 49 , which is encoded by exon 4 , resulted in APOL1 variant B ( d . 1 – 16 , d . 32 – 49 ) , which shows strongly reduced cytotoxicity . Similarly , APOL1 splice variants C and B3 , which lack the entire amino acid 32 – 49 region due to the absence of exon 4 in their tran - scripts , were not cytotoxic . These observations suggest that the region encoded by exon 4 is critical for APOL1 cyto - toxicity , while the region between amino acid residues 1 and 31 , encoded by exons 2 and 3 , does not contribute to cytotoxicity . In line with these ﬁndings , deletion of amino acid fragment 17 – 43 in APOL1 variant A strongly inhibited cytotoxicity , suggesting that an even shorter fragment , be - tween amino acids 32 and 43 , contributes to APOL1 toxic - ity . To assess quantitatively cytotoxicity of APOL1 splice v ariants , we measured colorimetrically the activity of LDH , a cytosolic enzyme released into the culture medium from damaged cells ( 27 ) . The LDH assay conﬁrmed a potent , statistically signiﬁcant ( P (cid:9) 0 . 001 ) cytotoxicity of APOL1 variants A and B1 and lack of signiﬁcant toxic effects of variants B3 and C ( Fig . 2 B ) . Since APOL1 variants A and B1 show a strong cytotoxic effect and variant A stimulates accumulation of lysosomes when overexpressed in HEK293T cells ( 44 ) , we considered the possibility that lysosome damage and release of lysosomal proteases may contribute to toxicity , as previously observed in podocytes ( 26 ) .

To conﬁrm these results , we investigated the effect of CLQ , an inhibitor of lysosomal acidiﬁcation , on cytotoxicity of APOL1 splice variants . Results show that inhibition of lysosomal acidiﬁcation by CLQ results in accumulation of autophagosomes ( see Fig . 4 A ) but does not reduce cytotoxicity of APOL1 variants A and B1 ( P (cid:9) 0 . 001 ; Fig . 2 C ) . Together , these results indicate that the amino acid sequence encoded by exon 4 contributes to the increased cytotoxicity of APOL1 variants A and B1 in a lysosome - independent manner . Fig . 2 .

Since TFEB also stimulates expression of autophagy genes ( 41 ) , nuclear localization of TFEB could serve as an indicator of sustained autophagy activation . To assess the ability of APOL1 splicing variants to promote nuclear localization of TFEB , TFEB - GFP was expressed in HEK293T cells in the absence or presence of APOL1 splice variants , and cellular localization of TFEB - GFP was monitored by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Fig . 3 A ) . In the absence of APOL1 , TFEB - GFP localized primarily to the cytoplasm , and , on average , only in 9 (cid:11) 6 % cells was TFEB - GFP detected in the nucleus or in the nucleus and cytoplasm . However , nuclear localization of TFEB - GFP was strongly enhanced by APOL1 variants A , B1 , and B ( d . 1 – 16 ) , with (cid:2) 80 % of cells showing nuclear localization of TFEB - GFP ( P (cid:9) 0 . 005 ; Fig . 3 B ) . In contrast , APOL1 splice variants and deletion mutants lacking the region encoded by exon 4 [ variant A ( d . 17 – 43 ) , variant B3 , and variant C ] did not notice - ably change the nuclear - cytoplasmic distribution pattern of TFEB - GFP ( Fig . 3 B ) . To investigate whether nuclear translocation of endogenous TFEB mediates cytotoxicity of APOL1 variants expressing the exon 4 - encoded sequence , knockdown of endogenous TFEB in HEK293T cells using TFEB siRNA was followed by transfec - tion of the cells with APOL1 splice variants . Despite (cid:2) 80 % knockdown of TFEB mRNA ( P (cid:9) 0 . 005 ; Fig . 3 D ) , cytotox - icity of APOL1 variant A or C was not affected ( P (cid:9) 0 . 005 ; Fig . 3 C ) . In conclusion , toxic effects of APOL1 are not mediated by nuclear localization of TFEB . Fig . 3 .

Since nuclear localization of TFEB induces genes controlling autophagosome biogenesis ( 41 ) , we next investigated whether the pattern of TFEB activation by APOL1 splice variants correlates with the induction of autophagy in HEK293T cells under a nutrient - rich condition . Accumulation of autophago - somes in cells overexpressing APOL1 splice variants was monitored by formation of ﬂuorescent puncta by transfected GFP - LC3 , a speciﬁc marker of autophagosomes ( 18 ) . In light of nuclear translocation of TFEB , we expected that variants A and B1 would induce stronger accumulation of autophago - somes than exon 4 - negative splice variants . Surprisingly , all tested APOL1 splice variants stimulated accumulation of GFP - LC3 puncta , indicative of accumulation of autophagosomes ( Fig . 4 A ) . In contrast to cells treated with CLQ , which show accumulation of small GFP - LC3 puncta distributed throughout the cytoplasm , overexpression of APOL1 splice variants re - sulted in formation of large and mainly perinuclear GFP - LC3 aggregates . To rule out the possibility that formation of GFP - LC3 puncta resulted from overexpression and nonspeciﬁc ag - gregation of GFP - LC3 , the cells were transfected with a mutant GFP - LC3 (cid:8) G in which COOH - terminal glycine 120 was substituted with an alanine residue , resulting in a protein unable to conjugate with PE , a step required for LC3 modiﬁ - cation and insertion into an autophagosomal membrane ( 43 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy showed lack of ﬂuorescent puncta in cells transfected with GFP - LC3 (cid:8) G in the absence or presence of APOL1 variant A or B1 ( Fig . 4 B ) . This observation was further conﬁrmed by Western blotting , which shows for - mation of PE - conjugated GFP - LC3 ( GFP - LC3 II ) in cells transfected with GFP - LC3 , but not with GFP - LC3 (cid:8) G mutant ( Fig . 4 C ) . This indicates that GFP - LC3 puncta accumulating in the presence of APOL1 variants represent autophagosomes . Furthermore , siRNA - mediated depletion of endogenous pro - tein Atg5 , required for the formation of autophagosomes ( 30 ) , suppressed accumulation of autophagosomes induced by APOL1 variant A or by an inhibitor of lysosomal acidiﬁcation , CLQ , which blocks fusion between autophagosomes and lyso - somes ( 5 ) ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . Formation of large GFP - LC3 structures suggests that APOL1 may stimulate aggregation of autophagosomes , which could interfere with their fusion with lysosomes . Indeed , a standard ﬂux assay ( 31 ) indicates no major differences in the accumulation of GFP - LC3 II in cells transfected with various APOL1 splice variants in the absence or presence of CLQ , suggesting ineffective autophagosome processing , rather than induction of autophagy ( Fig . 4 F ) . In conclusion , a sequence encoded by exon 4 is dispensable for stimulation of autophagosome accumulation by APOL1 splice variants . APOL1 Splice Variants Inhibit Autophagosome Maturation Enhanced accumulation of autophagosomes usually results from increased autophagosome formation , reduced fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes , or decreased proteolytic ac - tivity of lysosomes ( 37 ) . Previously , we showed that APOL1 variant A stimulates accumulation of enzymatically competent lysosomes ( 44 ) , suggesting that decreased proteolytic activity of lysosomes is less likely to affect autophagosome accumu - lation . To investigate the possibility that accumulation of autophagosomes results from decreased fusion with lysosomes , we took advantage of a tandem ﬂuorescent protein mRFP - EGFP - LC3 , which demonstrates yellow ﬂuorescence as a re - sult of similar stability of mRFP and green ﬂuorescent ( EGFP ) proteins at neutral pH of the cytoplasm or autophagosomes ( 23 ) . Since ﬂuorescence of the EGFP moiety in mRFP - EGFP - LC3 quenches in the acidic pH of lysosomes , while mRFP exhibits more stable ﬂuorescence , effective fusion of autopha - gosomes with lysosomes can be tracked by the accumulation of red - ﬂuorescing speckles . Confocal microscopy analysis shows predominant accumulation of yellow speckles in the perinuclear region , suggesting that all tested APOL1 splicing variants impair fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes ( Fig . 5 ) . Conse - quently , excessive accumulation of unprocessed autophagosomes may lead to their aggregation . However , a precise molecular mechanism underlying the observed inhibition of autophagosome maturation by APOL1 remains to be determined . HEK293T cells transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 ( control ) show predominant nu - clear accumulation of the mRFP - GFP - LC3 , as previously re - ported for other cell types ( 7 ) . Secreted APOL1 Does Not Contribute to Cytotoxicity Although APOL1 cytotoxicity is limited to splice variants that carry a sequence encoded by exon 4 , inhibition of autopha - gosome maturation in HEK293T cells is a hallmark of all examined APOL1 variants . Thus , to test the possibility that extracellular secretion and subsequent endocytic uptake of those APOL1 variants with a signal peptide ( contributed by exon 4 ) could lead to increased cytotoxicity ( 26 ) , we investi - gated release of myc - tagged APOL1 variants into the culture medium of transfected HEK293T cells . Surprisingly , all APOL1 variants were detectably immunoprecipitated from culture media of transfected cells ( Fig . 6 A ) . While the levels of APOL1 variants A and B1 could be overestimated due to cell damage induced by these variants , detection of variants B3 and C in immunoprecipitates suggests that these noncytotoxic splice variants may be released through a different mechanism . To examine whether APOL1 splice variants differ in their intracellular compartmentalization and / or membrane associa - tion , we tested sensitivity of APOL1 splice variants to extrac - tion with the mild nonionic detergent saponin . Transfected cells were treated with saponin , which gently permeabilizes cellular membranes by extracting cholesterol from the mem - branes ( 16 , 25 ) . As expected , permeabilization with 0 . 1 % saponin resulted in complete loss of cytosolic GAPDH , but not actin , usually assembled in detergent - resistant ﬁlaments ( Fig . 6 B ) . Under these experimental conditions , the levels of APOL1 in saponin - treated and control cells were comparable , while the level of actin was usually increased by (cid:2) 40 – 80 % in lysates from saponin - treated cells . This suggests that a signiﬁcant fraction of APOL1 splice variants was retained in cells inde - pendently of their NH 2 - terminal sequence , possibly by associ - ation with intracellular membranes through their putative membrane - spanning regions ( 45 ) . Since uptake of exogenous APOL1 by clathrin - mediated endocytosis was recently docu - mented in podocytes ( 28 ) , we tested whether endocytosis of APOL1 released by transfected cells contributes to the intra - cellular pool of APOL1 in HEK293T cells . We found that 24 C29 EXON 4 DETERMINES APOL1 CYTOTOXICITY AJP - Cell Physiol • doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpcell . 00384 . 2014 • www . ajpcell . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 1 on J u l y 9 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p c e ll . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m h of treatment of cells with a noncytotoxic ( 80 (cid:6) M ) concen - tration of dynasore , a speciﬁc inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 29 ) , did not affect intracellular accumulation of APOL1 variant B1 or B3 ( Fig . 6 C ) , suggesting that released APOL1 is not effectively endocytosed or is rapidly degraded upon internalization through a clathrin - independent pathway in these cells . Importantly , cytotoxicity of these variants was not detectably changed by treatment with dynasore ( P (cid:9) 0 . 005 ; Fig . 6 D ) , suggesting that , at least in HEK293T cells , clathrin - mediated endocytosis of APOL1 does not contribute to its toxicity . As expected , dynasore inhibited endocytosis of Alexa Fluor 594 - tagged transferrin ( 22 ) and DQ Green BSA , which Fig . 4 .

Intensities of bands corresponding to GFP - LC3 II and actin proteins were obtained from densitometric scanning , and the ratio of GFP - LC3 to actin in the absence or presence of CLQ was used as a measure of autophagic ﬂux .

A Human Podocyte Cell Line Expresses APOL1 Splice Variant Transcripts Not much is known about expression of APOL1 splice variants in cells . To investigate if APOL1 splice variants are expressed in podocytes , we have analyzed the splicing pattern of APOL1 in human conditionally immortalized and differen - tiated podocytes , AB8 / 13 ( 39 ) , untreated or treated with IFN (cid:4) , which is known to induce APOL1 expression ( 34 , 51 ) . A set of PCR primers designed to anneal to exons 1 and 6 were used to amplify several DNA products , with a major ( (cid:2) 350 - bp ) DNA product that corresponded to the size predicted for APOL1 variant A ( Fig . 7 A ) . Interestingly , the putative APOL1 tran - scripts were detected also in unstimulated cells . To evaluate the existence of APOL1 splice variant transcripts in an unbiased manner , we designed PCR primer pairs for use in a two - step PCR ( Fig . 7 B ) . In the ﬁrst step , all APOL1 transcripts contain - ing exons 1 and 6 were ampliﬁed in 18 cycles , and a 1 / 25th fraction of the product volume was subjected to a second round of PCR with a new set of PCR primers ( annealing to exons 3 and 6 ) , which would allow us to distinguish between exon 4 - positive and - negative transcripts . Eighteen - cycle ampliﬁca - tion in the second PCR produced two major DNA products corresponding to putative exon 4 - negative transcripts ( 196 bp , variant C / variant B3 ) and 250 - bp exon 4 - positive transcripts ( variant A / variant B1 ) . The identity of these transcripts was conﬁrmed after extraction of DNA from the gel , cloning into pJET vector , and DNA sequencing ( Fig . 7 D ) . Densitometric analysis ( Fig . 7 B ) shows that exon 4 - positive and - negative APOL1 transcripts increased (cid:2) 1 . 6 - fold after IFN (cid:4) induction . The level of exon 4 - positive transcripts was (cid:2) 17 - fold higher than the level of exon 4 - negative transcripts in uninduced and induced podocytes . Interestingly , despite the moderate ( (cid:2) 1 . 6 - fold ) increase in APOL1 splice variant transcript levels in podocytes stimulated with IFN (cid:4) , APOL1 protein levels were induced (cid:3) 16 - fold by IFN (cid:4) ( Fig . 7 C ) . This suggests that , in unstimulated podocytes , APOL1 transcripts may be seques - tered in translationally inactive compartments ( e . g . , stress granules or processing bodies ) ( 20 ) , from which APOL1 mR - NAs could be quickly mobilized for immediate translation upon podocyte stimulation . DISCUSSION Increased cytotoxicity of APOL1 G1 or G2 variants has been demonstrated to be associated with podocyte injury ( 26 ) ; how - ever , it is unknown whether there are additional determinants that may affect APOL1 cytotoxicity . Indeed , low penetrance of G1 - and G2 - associated kidney disease ( 24 ) , as well as notice - able cytotoxicity of overexpressed wild - type APOL1 G0 ( 26 , 34 ) , suggests the existence of modifying factors that may Fig . 5 . APOL1 splice variants inhibit autophagosome maturation . HEK293T cells were transfected with a tandem ﬂuorescent monomeric red ﬂuorescent protein ( mRFP ) - enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) - LC3 fusion construct and APOL1 splice variants . After 24 h , cells were ﬁxed , mounted in antifade reagent with DAPI ( blue , nuclei ) , and observed under confocal microscopy . In the absence of APOL1 ( Control , pcDNA3 . 1 ) , mRFP - EGFP - LC3 localizes predominantly to the nucleus , with only a few puncta detectable in the cytoplasm . In the presence of APOL1 , large aggregates of mRFP - EGFP - LC3 accumulate in the perinuclear region , yielding a mostly yellow signal , indicating inhibition of autophagosome fusion with lysosomes . A small number of red puncta demonstrate autophagosomes that fused with lysosomes ( autolysosomes ) . Scale bar (cid:10) 20 (cid:6) m .

These products were not ampliﬁed without a previous reverse - transcription reaction ( RT (cid:13) ) , suggesting that isolated RNA was not contaminated with cellular DNA ( right ) . B : to amplify exon 4 - negative APOL1 splice variants , a new set of primers was designed to anneal to exon 3 ( forward ) and exon 6 ( reverse ) . One (cid:6) l of the 1st PCR product obtained after 18 - cycle ampliﬁcation ( A ) was ampliﬁed in a 2nd PCR ( 18 cycles ) , and products were separated on 3 % agarose gel with ethidium bromide . Two PCR products were detected : a major ( (cid:2) 250 - bp ) band corresponding to the expected size of the ampliﬁed fragment of variants A and B1 ( v . A / v . B1 ) and a minor ( (cid:2) 196 - bp ) band corresponding to the expected size of variants C and B3 ( v . C / v . B3 ) . Numbers shown next to the DNA bands represent intensities of DNA signals relative to intensity of the 196 - bp band in unstimulated cells ( set as 1 . 0 ) and were obtained from densitometric scanning . C : expression of APOL1 proteins in differentiated AB8 / 13 podocytes after 24 h of exposure to IFN (cid:4) ( 50 ng / ml ) . Immunoblot analysis ( independent , duplicate samples ) shows strong induction of APOL1 proteins . As determined by densitometric scanning , podocytes stimulated with IFN (cid:4) express 16 . 1 - to 17 . 3 - fold higher levels of APOL1 proteins than unstimulated control cells .

The most striking example is development of HIVAN in HIV - 1 - infected individuals with two copies of APOL1 risk allele G1 or G2 . Accordingly , the presence of risk alleles is the major contributor to development of HIVAN , which develops in (cid:3) 50 % of G1 or G2 carriers . Interestingly , although HIVAN was not found in the HIV - 1 - infected Ethiopian population , which is known to lack APOL1 G1 or G2 risk alleles ( 3 ) , Atta et al . ( 2 ) provide evidence that HIVAN may develop in some African American patients who do not carry APOL1 risk alleles . This observation suggests that , in speciﬁc conditions , APOL1 G1 or G2 risk alleles may be dispensable for development of HIVAN . However , whether APOL1 G0 , with or without other genetic risk variants , can substitute for G1 or G2 in HIVAN is unknown . Because APOL1 G0 is also cytotoxic when overexpressed ( 49 , 51 ) , we have investigated the possibility of the existence of G1 / G2 - independent determinants that may contribute to APOL1 G0 toxicity . Over 90 % of human genes are alternatively spliced , indicat - ing that alternative splicing of pre - mRNA represents a major mechanism for expanding gene function and proteome diver - sity ( 50 ) . We thus investigated the possibility that alternatively spliced APOL1 G0 transcripts ( reported by several databases , including the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Ensembl ) contribute to G1 / G2 - independent toxicity of APOL1 G0 . APOL1 can be expressed from several alterna - tively spliced mRNAs . The major APOL1 splice variants , A , B , and C , differ in their NH 2 - terminal amino acid composition due to alternative splicing and rearrangement of small exons 2 , 3 , and 4 , while exons 5 and 6 and the largest , exon 7 , are present in all mature APOL1 mRNAs ( 8 ) . Since exons 2 , 3 , and 4 contribute to a signal peptide , altered expression of these exons in APOL1 transcripts may result in synthesis of proteins with altered intracellular compartmentalization and biological function . Although the existence of APOL1 splice transcript variants was recently demonstrated in human coronary artery endothe - lial cells ( 34 ) , the presence of APOL1 splice variants in the kidney has not been established . Here , we show that the unstimulated and IFN (cid:4) - stimulated human podocyte cell line AB8 / 13 ( 39 ) expresses alternatively spliced APOL1 transcripts without exon 4 at a level (cid:2) 17 - fold lower than exon 4 - positive transcripts . Although APOL1 transcripts with or without exon 4 were only moderately ( (cid:2) 1 . 6 - fold ) stimulated by IFN (cid:4) , total expression of APOL1 proteins was potently enhanced ( (cid:3) 16 - fold ) compared with unstimulated podocytes . These results suggest that APOL1 transcripts may be constitutively ex - pressed in podocytes but kept translationally inactive by com - partmentalization , possibly in stress granules or processing bodies ( 20 ) , from which they could be rapidly mobilized for translation in response to exogenous stimuli . Although APOL1 transcripts without exon 4 are clearly expressed in a human podocyte cell line cultured in the absence of IFN (cid:4) , it is unclear whether these transcripts are translation - ally competent in podocytes stimulated with IFN (cid:4) . Differences in the molecular sizes of APOL1 proteins encoded by alterna - tively spliced transcripts are insufﬁcient for unbiased identiﬁ - cation of APOL1 variant proteins by Western blot analysis ( Fig . 1 D ) , and experiments are ongoing to identify APOL1 splice variant proteins by mass spectrometry . To investigate whether alternatively spliced APOL1 tran - scripts can produce proteins with different biological activities , APOL1 proteins were expressed from engineered vectors en - coding splice variants ( Fig . 1 B ) . Since increased cytotoxicity is a hallmark of APOL1 G1 / G2 risk variants ( 26 , 34 , 45 ) , we analyzed cytotoxicity of alternatively spliced APOL1 G0 vari - ants in human kidney HEK293T cells . These cells were se - lected because of high transfection efﬁciency , lack of detect - able levels of endogenous APOL1 , and high sensitivity to the toxic effects of APOL1 . Although use of this cell system proved to be useful in identifying differences in biological activities between APOL1 variant proteins , this experimental system suffers from some shortfalls . One is that overexpressed proteins may change or acquire additional behavior . However , expression levels of endogenous APOL1 in podocytes ( Fig . 7 C ) were not signiﬁcantly different from those detected in HEK293T cells transfected with limiting amounts of APOL1 expression vectors ( Fig . 1 D ) . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that overexpressed APOL1 may differently affect proliferating HEK293T cells and differentiated , nondividing podocytes , which strongly depend on autophagy to maintain their homeostasis ( 11 , 15 ) . By staining transfected HEK293T cells with the DNA dyes Hoechst 33342 and PI ( which stain apoptotic and necrotic cells , respectively ) , we found that APOL1 variants A and B1 demonstrate increased cytotoxicity compared with splice vari - ants B3 and C , which lack the amino acid sequence 32 – 49 encoded by exon 4 . Furthermore , deletion of the ﬁrst 16 amino acid residues ( encoded by exon 2 and part of exon 3 ) from variant B1 did not reduce cytotoxicity , suggesting that these exons do not contribute to the toxicity of APOL1 . However , deletion of a sequence encoded by exon 3 and part of exon 4 ( residues 17 – 43 ) from variant A inhibited a cytotoxic pheno - type of variant A , indicating that exon 4 ( or even its subfrag - ment comprising residues 32 – 43 ) is a major determinant of APOL1 cytotoxicity . These ﬁndings were subsequently con - ﬁrmed using a quantitative LDH cytotoxicity assay . In light of our previous ﬁndings showing increased lysosomal abundance in HEK293T cells ( 44 ) and increased lysosomal membrane permeability in podocytes expressing APOL1 ( 26 ) , we ex - pected to observe reduced APOL1 cytotoxicity in the presence of inhibitors of lysosomal proteases or inhibitors of lysosomal acidiﬁcation ( CLQ ) . However , lack of the effect of these compounds indicates that , in contrast to podocytes ( 26 ) , APOL1 toxicity in HEK293T cells is not mediated by exces - sive lysosomal damage . TFEB controls multiple steps of the autophagy pathway and may ensure prolonged activation of autophagy , which is gen - erally considered a cytoprotective pathway under conditions of stress . TFEB is normally localized to the cytosol but translo - cates to the nucleus under starvation conditions or when lysosomal function is impaired . Such translocation enables the coordinated expression of several genes belonging to the Co - ordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation ( CLEAR ) network , which controls lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy ( 36 , 40 , 41 ) , processes that are critical for the homeostasis of long - lived and terminally differentiated cells . We previously reported that cell toxicity induced by exon 4 - expressing APOL1 splice variants coincided with the nuclear translocation of TFEB ( 44 ) . In contrast , in the current study noncytotoxic APOL1 splice variants did not induce nuclear translocation of C34 EXON 4 DETERMINES APOL1 CYTOTOXICITY AJP - Cell Physiol • doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpcell . 00384 . 2014 • www . ajpcell . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 1 on J u l y 9 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p c e ll . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m TFEB - GFP , raising the possibility that TFEB may mediate cytotoxicity of exon 4 - expressing APOL1 variants . To exam - ine this possibility , we used siRNA , which achieved (cid:2) 80 % knockdown of endogenous TFEB transcript levels , but we did not ﬁnd reduced cytotoxicity of the exon 4 - containing APOL1 variant A . This indicates that nuclear translocation of TFEB is likely a downstream effect of APOL1 and does not itself mediate APOL1 cytotoxicity . Surprisingly , all tested APOL1 splice variants stimulated accumulation of perinuclear autopha - gosome aggregates . Future experiments will have to answer the apparently con - tradictory observation that noncytotoxic APOL1 splice variants inhibit autophagy without causing detrimental effects . One possible explanation is that , in contrast to differentiated podo - cytes , HEK293T cells divide and , thus , do not rely exclusively on autophagy for elimination of waste products . Another pos - sibility is that although macroautophagy is signiﬁcantly blocked by different APOL1 variants , the effect may be not immediately toxic to the cells cultured in nutrient - rich condi - tions and analyzed 24 h after transfection of APOL1 - express - ing vectors . Finally , upregulation of microautophagy ( 38 ) or chaperone - mediated autophagy ( 14 ) may compensate for im - pairment of macroautophagy . Indeed , inhibition of macroau - tophagy was shown to stimulate chaperone - mediated au - tophagy ( 19 ) . Thus there is a need to test whether nontoxic APOL1 variants stimulate compensatory pathways , thereby avoiding , at least temporarily , damaging effects to the cells . In attempting to identify the mechanism of APOL1 cytotox - icity , we have tested the role of caspases using the broad - spectrum caspase inhibitor Z - VAD - FMK and caspase - 3 cleav - age assays . Results of these experiments did not indicate involvement of caspases in cytotoxicity of exon 4 - expressing APOL1 splice variants ( not shown ) . This observation opens the possibility that APOL1 toxicity could be mediated by caspase - independent pathways mediated by dysfunctional mitochon - dria or endoplasmic reticulum stress . These possibilities are under investigation . Since increased cytotoxicity of APOL1 splice variants A and B1 is determined by exon 4 , which contributes to formation of a signal peptide , we also explored whether secretion and subsequent uptake of these variants correlated with cellular toxicity . Surprisingly , APOL1 splice variants were secreted into the culture medium of transfected cells , including variants that lack exon 4 - encoding sequences . We assume that there may be a nonspeciﬁc release into the medium due to cell damage ; however , this would mainly affect the release of toxic APOL1 variants A and B1 . The mechanism of secretion of nontoxic APOL1 variants is unknown , but it may involve alternative molecular determinants or nonclassical protein se - cretion pathways . In this context , we have shown that APOL1 can be released from HEK293T cells in association with microvesicles / exosomes ( 44 ) . Permeabilization of transfected cells with saponin shows that a signiﬁcant fraction of APOL1 is resistant to saponin extraction , possibly as a result of the association of putative membrane - spanning domains of APOL1 with intracellular membranes , as previously suggested ( 45 ) . However , it is pos - sible that APOL1 may induce cytotoxicity after being endocy - tosed . Indeed , in podocytes , secreted APOL1 was shown to contribute to podocyte injury ( 26 ) . To test this possibility , we used a speciﬁc inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , dynasore ( 29 ) . Our results indicate that dynasore did not affect accumulation of APOL1 or improved viability in cells trans - fected with the cytotoxic variant B1 . These ﬁndings suggest that , at least in HEK293T cells , APOL1 is not effectively endocytosed through a clathrin - dependent pathway or is rap - idly degraded upon internalization through a clathrin - indepen - dent pathway . A discrepancy between this and another study ( 28 ) , which demonstrated APOL1 uptake by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , may be related to the use of different cells or different experimental conditions to inhibit endocytosis . Thomson et al . ( 45 ) demonstrated increased hepatic necrosis in mice transduced with the APOL1 splice variant A carrying G1 and G2 risk alleles , as opposed to the nonrisk ( G0 ) APOL1 variant A . Deletion of the signal peptide reduced , but did not abolish , hepatic necrosis , whereas deletion of the amphipathic helix at the COOH terminus of APOL1 signiﬁcantly attenuated liver injury . These studies are consistent with our ﬁndings showing that APOL1 splice variants lacking exon 4 are less toxic . In the current study we investigated only the G0 version of APOL1 in its different splice variants . Together with prior ﬁndings showing cytotoxicity of APOL1 G0 , it is possible that all allelic variants of APOL1 are potentially nephrotoxic , with differential thresholds for the G0 vs . G1 and G2 risk alleles that can be further modiﬁed by alternative splicing . Therefore , further studies should explore the biological effect of G1 and G2 risk alleles in the context of splice variants that lack exon 4 , as well as the effect of various external factors , including viral - mediated responses , on the relative abundance of differ - ent splice variants . In conclusion , we have shown that APOL1 splice variants demonstrate differential toxicity in HEK293T cells , with APOL1 splice variants lacking exon 4 - encoding sequences being nontoxic to the cells in the time frame of the experi - ments . We hypothesize that different expression patterns of the APOL1 splice variants may contribute to kidney disease risk and can partly explain the variable lifetime kidney disease risk between carriers of two APOL1 risk alleles .
