Our results show that CP with a single tentacle , either the (cid:1) or (cid:3) , deletion mutant had a normal capping on - rate . There - fore , the (cid:1) tentacle may provide specificity for the initial is able to cap , as can the (cid:3) tentacle alone , even as a free peptide . These results support another mechanism , interaction of CP with the barbed end . What are the molecular interactions between CP and in which the capping molecule ( in this case one tentacle ) binds at the interface between the terminal actin subunit the barbed end implied by the tentacle model and our results ? The two protofilament ends in an actin filament and an adjacent actin subunit in the filament , thus in - creasing the number of bonds that connect the terminal are staggered in relation to each other [ 1 ] . Functionally , capping requires decreasing both subunit addition and actin subunit to the filament ( subunit interface binding , on the right in Figure 4 ) . We favor this actin - actin inter - loss . A protein binding anywhere near the barbed end and sterically preventing access of a free monomer face binding mechanism for several reasons . CP con - taining only the (cid:1) tentacle binds the barbed end with would inhibit addition . Alternatively , the protein may cause a change in theconformation of the actin subunits an affinity almost 5 - fold tighter than the affinity of an actin subunit for the barbed end , owing to a smaller off - at the end , such that other subunits cannot add [ 10 ] . Capping also implies inhibition of actin subunit loss from rate constant . Thus , interaction of the (cid:1) tentacle with only the terminal actin subunit at the barbed end seems the end . Decreasing the off - rate for the terminal actin subunit at the barbed end is critical , likely requiring an unlikely . Moreover , the fact that the (cid:3) C34 and (cid:3) C28 tentacle peptides alone cap the barbed end also sug - increased number or strength of binding interactions between the terminal subunit and the other subunits of gests that the binding site for the (cid:3) tentacle is an actin - actin subunit interface .

Such a mechanism is proposed for capping by the ( K mon (cid:1) 10 (cid:4) M ) , the (cid:1) tentacle deletion mutant ( K mon (cid:1) 10 (cid:4) M ) , and the (cid:3) C34 peptide ( K mon (cid:1) 100 (cid:4) M ) .

CP with either single tentacle can cap , suggesting that the individual tentacles interact with more than one actin subunit at a subunit - interface at the barbed end .
