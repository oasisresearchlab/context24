1 Dissension or consensus ? Management and Business Research in Latin America and the Caribbean Julián D . Cortés Universidad del Rosario , Colombia Fudan University , China E - mail : julian . cortess @ urosario . edu . co Abstract This study presents longitudinal evidence on the dissension of Management and Business Research ( MBR ) in Latin America and the Caribbean ( LAC ) . It looks after intellectual bridges linking clusters among such dissension . It was implemented a coword network analysis to a sample of 12 , 000 + articles published by authors from LAC during 1998 - 2017 . Structural network scores showed an increasing number of keywords and mean degree but decreasing modularity and density . The intellectual bridges were those of the cluster formed by disciplines / fields that tend toward consensus ( e . g . , mathematical models ) and not by core MBR subjects ( e . g . , strategic planning ) . Introduction The Winchester Mystery House has been used as an analogy for Management and Business related Research ( MBR )  a purposeless although expensive entity ( Davis , 2015 ) . The hypothesis of the Hierarchy of Sciences states that while some sciences / disciplines studying simple phenomena ( i . e . , cells’ functioning ) will tend toward consensus , others studying complex phenomena ( i . e . , human collective behavior ) will tend toward dissension ( Fanelli & Glänzel , 2013 ) . Thus , the latter path should be shaping MBR . Bottom line , dissension fragments research findings to advance on  a significant downsize effect for regions with scarce R & D resources such as Latin America and the Caribbean ( LAC ) ( Cortés - Sánchez , 2019 ) . This study aims two - fold : i ) to explore such dissension in MBR in LAC ; ii ) and to identify potential intellectual bridges to pooling efforts and multiply impact . I implemented the coword analysis ( Callon et al . , 1983 ) . Such a science mapping ( SM ) technique enables stakeholders to map individual / institutional / national research and knowledge competencies ( Shiffrin & Börner , 2004 ) . Findings would be of interest to researchers in MBR , business schools , and funders by presenting the first comprehensive regional study for MBR to identify research clusters , topics as intellectual bridges between disciplines , and their evolution since 1998 . Methodology This study modeled four coword networks for the periods 1998 - 2002 , 2003 - 2007 , 2008 - 2012 , and 2013 - 2017 . Dissension paths were explored by computing and comparing macro , meso , and micro structural network scores . Dataset and high - resolution figures are available in open access for replication and further use ( Baker & Penny , 2016 ) : http : / / bit . ly / 2QyDJNP Data Bibliographic data was sourced from Scopus due to its journal coverage and LAC authors’ involvement ( Mongeon & Paul - Hus , 2016 ) . The query searched for articles published from 1998 to 2017 by at least one author affiliated with any LAC institution in SCImago ' s business , management , and accounting subject area ( SCImago , 2020 ) . The final sample consisted of 12 , 149 articles after removing a journal with predatory features ( Cortés - Sánchez , 2019 ) and 2 articles with missing data .

Note : MCP : Multi - Country Publication . Methods and software Coword analysis enables putting together the conceptual structure based on the co - occurrence of articles keywords ( Callon et al . , 1983 ) . KeyWords Plus method generates key - terms based on the articles’ title and the references cited appearing more than twice ( Clarivate Analytics , n . d . ) . A link connects two keywords ( i . e . , nodes ) if both appear in the same research article ( i . e . , edge ) . The scores computed for the coword networks were : i ) macro : density , mean degree , modularity ; ii ) meso : number of clusters ; iii ) and micro : betweenness ( Scott & Carrington , 2014 ) . Density is the proportion of links in a network relative to the total number of links possible . The mean degree is the average number of links per node in the network . Modularity express a networks’ strength of cluster division . Increasing values indicate the existence of a community - like structure . Clustering analysis identifies highly interconnected nodes to uncover known communities . Betweenness unveils a node’s capacity in mediating the flow of information in a network . Increasing values indicate a higher betweenness . Bibliometrix ( Aria & Cuccurullo , 2017 ) and Gephi ( Bastian et al . , 2009 ) were used for networks’ layout and scores’ computation . Results and discussion Figure 1 summarizes the macro , meso , and micro scores for each network . The period 2008 - 2012 stands out as the network with the highest increase in the number of nodes ( 198 % ) , mean degree ( 55 % ) , and clusters ( 39 % ) . Density and modularity , however , diminished by 50 % and 2 % , respectively . The networks’ density and modularity had decreased throughout 1998 - 2017 despite the mean degree’s uninterrupted growth . The number of clusters peaked in 2008 - 2012 ( 39 ) and reached the lowest point in 2013 - 2017 ( 22 ) . Ronda and Guerras ( 2012 ) found that density and clusterability , a modularity proxy , have increased between 1962 - 2008 for the strategic management coword network . That seems plausible for an MBR sub - field . Using bibliographic coupling , Fanelli and Glänzel ( 2013 ) computed a mean degree and modularity for the field of business and economics of 27 . 3 and 0 . 5 , respectively , which were similar to the mean degree of 2008 - 2012 ( 29 . 6 ) and the modularity of 2013 - 2017 ( 0 . 53 ) . The caveat is that bibliographic coupling networks are different from co - word analysis , the latter similar to that of cocitations ( Yan & Ding , 2012 ) . Figure 2 presents the four coword networks . Nodes’ size is proportional to their betweenness . Nodes with labels are : i ) those among the top - 10 betweenness ; ii ) those that increased their 3 position among the top - 20 betweenness compared to the previous period ( light - green colored ) ; and iii ) those that decreased their position among the top - 20 betweenness compared to the previous period ( red - colored ) . Clusters colored in burgundy and pine - green are the first and second - largest ones , respectively . I tagged clusters manually following a discernible thread among highly connected keywords . The two most crowded clusters for each period were : i ) 1998 - 2002 : mathematical models , computer simulation , and algorithms ( 18 % nodes ) , and science , technology and innovation ( STi ) ( 10 % ) ; ii ) 2003 - 2007 : LAC issues ( 15 % ) , and strategic management for sustainable development ( 15 % ) ; iii ) 2008 - 2012 : STi in LAC ( 10 % ) , and mathematical models , computer simulation , and algorithms ( 9 % ) ; and iv ) 2013 - 2017 : strategic management for sustainable development ( 22 % ) ; and logistics ( 14 % ) .

Table 2 ( Appendix ) presents the top - 20 keywords by period according to their betweenness . Topics comprised of mathematical models , computer simulation , and algorithms cluster show consistent appearance among the four periods . Sustainable development and environmental impact related issues also showed consistent appearances . In contrast , MBR core topics , such as strategic planning , quality control , or marketing , showed either intermittent appearances or a downward trend . Crowded clusters mixed between each other ( e . g . , STi plus LAC issues  STI in LAC ) and specific keywords persisted ( e . g . , mathematical models , computer simulation , and algorithms ; or strategic management for sustainable development ) . Contrasting those findings with the persistence and higher betweenness of the mathematical models , it unveils the broader applications of such methods for MBR and other disciplines ( e . g . , from supply chain management to e - commerce and genetics ) , even more than influential methods in MBR such as case study ( actually , copied from medical sciences ) ( Eisenhardt , 1989 ) . Furthermore , global solution - oriented agreements such as the Sustainable Development Goals produced inflections in the research output and permeated MBR in LAC and other developing regions ( Cortés - Sánchez et al . , 2020 ) . Conclusion This study presented longitudinal evidence on the increasing dissension path of MBR in LAC . Also , it presented the mixture and persistence of crowded clusters and intellectual bridges . Such bridges were not from MBR but different disciplines moving toward consensus ( e . g . , mathematics or physics ) . Further research could implement non - redundant SM techniques such as social ( i . e . , coauthorships ) or information ( i . e . , bibliographic coupling ) based networks , discuss the advantage and obstacles of open vs . closed network structures , and source data from broader and inclusive bibliographic databases ( e . g . , Google Scholar or Dimensions ) .
