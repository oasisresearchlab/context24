Interdependent Sampling and Social Influence Jerker Denrell & Gaël Le Mens Stanford University Why does the attitude of A influence the attitude of B ? Why does the attitude of A influence the attitude of B ?

We propose a very different explanation We make different assumptions : A’s attitude is only based on A’s own experiences . The experiences of A and B are independent We make different assumptions : A’s attitude is only based on A’s own experiences . The experiences of A and B are independent Nevertheless , attitudes become synchronized if the attitude of B influence when A gets another experience Restaurant example Negative Attitude to Restaurant Indirect effect through exposure Negative Attitude to Restaurant Unlikely to Attend Indirect effect through exposure Negative Attitude to Restaurant Unlikely to Attend Negative Attitude Persists Indirect effect through exposure Negative Attitude to Restaurant A Colleague Wants to Go Indirect effect through exposure Negative Attitude to Restaurant Likely to Attend A Colleague Wants to Go Indirect effect through exposure Negative Attitude to Restaurant Likely to Attend Negative Attitude May Change A Colleague Wants to Go Indirect effect through exposure A simple model of interdependent sampling A’s Attitude B’s Attitude A simple model of interdependent sampling A’s Desire to Sample B’s Desire to Sample A’s Attitude B’s Attitude A simple model of interdependent sampling Sampling Decision A’s Desire to Sample B’s Desire to Sample A’s Attitude B’s Attitude A simple model of interdependent sampling Sampling Decision A’s Desire to Sample B’s Desire to Sample A’s Attitude B’s Attitude A’s Experience B’s Experience A simple model of interdependent sampling Sampling Decision A’s Desire to Sample B’s Desire to Sample A’s Attitude B’s Attitude A’s Experience B’s Experience A’s Attitude B’s Attitude P e r i od t P e r i od t + 1 A simple model of interdependent sampling Sampling Decision A’s Desire to Sample B’s Desire to Sample A’s Attitude B’s Attitude A’s Experience B’s Experience A’s Attitude B’s Attitude P e r i od t P e r i od t + 1 Independent Random Variables A simple model of interdependent sampling Sampling Decision A’s Desire to Sample B’s Desire to Sample A’s Attitude B’s Attitude A’s Experience B’s Experience A’s Attitude B’s Attitude P e r i od t P e r i od t + 1 Depends on the attitudes of Both Independent Random Variables A simple model of interdependent sampling Overview A’s Experience B’s Experience Sampling Decision A’s Desire to Sample B’s Desire to Sample A’s Attitude B’s Attitude P e r i od t A’s Attitude B’s Attitude P e r i od t + 1 Overview 1 .
