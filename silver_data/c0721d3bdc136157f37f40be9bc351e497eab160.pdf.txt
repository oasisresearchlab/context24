interface , since other F - actin - rich structures , such as stress fibers , do not contain cortactin . Despite the substantial size of the cortactin litera - ture ( currently the word “cortactin” appears in 339 articles ) , the most fundamental questions are still open . Thus , although cortactin has been implicated in the above - mentioned processes , its exact role is still not clearly defined . Its obvious participation in many of these fundamental events together with the elusive - ness of its exact role render cortactin the gray emi - nence of the cytoskeleton . Moreover , the role of tyro - sine ( and serine / threonine ) phosphorylation in the regulation of its function , localization , and interaction with other proteins is also far from being fully under - stood . Thus both the regulation of cortactin and the regulation by cortactin remain a challenge of cytoskeletal biology . Furthermore , cortactin has estab - lished itself as a medically important protein , since it is not only overexpressed in a variety of human cancers but appears to play a causative role in tumor cell migration and metastasis ( 58 , 74 ) . In the past few years , cortactin was the focus of sev - eral excellent reviews ( 19 , 62 , 85 , 103 ) . In this short overview , we would like to approach the topic from a physiological point of view , or , more precisely , we attempt to provide a “topical physiology” of cortactin by summarizing the various loci where cortactin acts and the associated cell biological processes in which it appears to participate . We have to start , however , with a more detailed look at its biochemistry and genetics . Cortactin in the Test Tube The cortactin family is composed of two gene prod - ucts : the ubiquitously expressed cortactin with its alternatively spliced variants and the hematopoietic lineage cell - specific protein ( HS1 ) , present exclusively in blood cells ( 84 , 96 ) . Human cortactin is encoded by the CTTN ( formerly EMS1 ) gene within the chromo - some region 11q13 , a locus often amplified in various 352 1548 - 9213 / 05 8 . 00 ©2006 Int . Union Physiol . Sci . / Am . Physiol . Soc . Cortactin was discovered 15 years ago in Thomas Parson’s laboratory as a filamentous actin - binding protein and a major substrate of the oncogenic tyro - sine kinase v - Src ( 104 , 105 ) . These two signature fea - tures ( F - actin binding and phosphorylation by various kinases ) have initiated the continuously growing career of this protein and focused attention on cor - tactin as a candidate molecule that might link struc - tural ( cytoskeletal ) organization with signal transduc - tion . The recognition that cortactin binds to and potentiates the activity of the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex ( 94 , 98 , 102 ) , a recently discovered central actin - nucleating factor ( 36 ) , gave strong exper - imental support for this notion . Moreover , in addition to being a likely bridge between receptor - mediated or mechanical signals on one hand and actin skeleton restructuring on the other , cortactin has emerged as a key protein involved in the coordination of membrane dynamics and cytoskeleton remodeling ( 81 ) . Indeed cortactin is always “there” when changes in the corti - cal actin skeleton initiate , modify , or accompany major membrane events . Thus cortactin accumulates in lamellipodia where the freshly polymerized F - actin meshwork pushes the membrane envelope of migrat - ing cells ( 8 , 61 , 101 ) at the leading edge of path - finding axons ( 15 , 52 , 53 ) ; in the invadopodia by which metastatic tumor cells penetrate the basement mem - brane ( 5 , 6 ) ; in podosomes , where bone - resorbing osteoclasts seal off the surface to be digested ( 21 , 60 ) ; at intercellular contacts , where cells strengthen or dis - assemble their bonds ( 27 , 28 , 34 ) ; around endocytic vesicles , which move toward the cytosol in an actin - dependent manner ( 12 , 45 ) ; at the entry sites of intra - cellular pathogens , which propel themselves by har - nessing the F - actin polymerization machinery ( for review , see Ref . 85 ) ; or at the periphery of mechanical - ly challenged cells , which reinforce their cytoskeleton ( 3 , 22 ) . Clearly , the common denominator of these diverse events is not simply the presence of F - actin but the formation of a dynamic membrane - cytoskeleton REVIEWS Cortactin : The Gray Eminence of the Cytoskeleton Laura I . Cosen - Binker and András Kapus Saint Michael’s Hospital Research Institute and Department of Surgery , University of Toronto , Toronto , Ontario , Canada kapusa @ smh . toronto . on . ca Cortactin , an actin filament - binding protein and target of multiple kinases , has emerged as a central element connecting signaling pathways with cytoskeleton restructuring . It is involved in a perplexingly diverse array of cellular processes , includ - ing cell motility , invasiveness , synaptogenesis , endocytosis , intercellular contact assembly , and host - pathogen interactions , where the common denominator appears to be a role in the coordination of membrane dynamics with cytoskeletal remodeling . Although in recent years our knowledge about cortactin has increased exponentially , the exact mechanisms underlying its fundamental roles remain to be defined .

Amplification of the cortactin gene or increased expression of the cortactin mRNA [ e . g . , in bladder can - cer ( 7 ) ] is associated with metastasis and poor progno - sis , implicating cortactin as a factor in invasiveness . The cortactin protein is composed of ~ 550 amino acids ( FIGURE 1A ) . The N - terminal half of the mole - cule includes the N - terminal acidic region ( NTA ) , which harbors the DDW motif , the binding site for the Arp3 component of the Arp2 / 3 complex , followed by 6 . 5 tandem repeats of 37 amino acids responsible for F - actin binding ( 103 ) . Thus this half of the molecule is responsible for coupling cortactin to structural ele - ments of the cytoskeleton . The COOH - terminal half is composed of an (cid:10) - helical domain of unknown func - tion , followed by a proline - serine - threonine - rich region ( PST ) , which also harbors critical tyrosine residues , and finally a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain . Thus the COOH - terminal half of cortactin can be regarded as the regulatory segment of the protein : the PST is a target of various serine / threonine kinases , of which p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) ( 97 ) and the MAP kinase ERK ( 11 , 64 ) have been identified and implicat - ed in the phosphorylation of S405 and S418 , whereas three critical tyrosine residues ( Y421 / 466 / 482 ) are tar - geted ( directly or indirectly ) by members of the Src kinase family v - Src , c - Src , and Fyn ( 39 , 46 , 47 , 104 ) ; other non - receptor tyrosine kinases such as FER ( 46 , 50 ) and Syk ( 30 ) ; and the hepatocytes growth factor receptor kinase MET ( 18 ) . The SH3 domain is a hub of interactions through which cortactin has been shown to associate with the proline - rich regions of a plethora of proteins , thereby linking cortactin - mediated actin remodeling to the various specific loci and processes . The SH3 - binding partners include the Arp2 / 3 - stimu - lating Wiscott - Aldrich protein N - WASP ( 70 ) and the WASP - interacting protein WIP ( 51 ) , missing in metas - tasis protein MIM ( 59 ) , the endocytic GTPase dynamin - 2 ( 67 ) , the receptor endocytosis - regulator scaffold CD2AP ( 63 ) , the tight junction ( TJ ) protein ZO - 1 , the synaptic adaptor protein Shank2 ( 23 ) , the Cdc42 activator guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) faciogenital dysplasia 1 ( FGD1 ) ( 37 ) , CBP90 , a brain - and mammary gland - specific protein of unknown function ( 44 , 72 ) , and the contractility - enhancing myosin light chain kinase ( 24 ) . This list clearly indicates that a remarkably diverse array of processes employs cortactin as their link to cytoskele - ton remodeling . The breakthrough in our understanding of the basic function of cortactin was the discovery that it associ - ates with and acts as an activator of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 94 , 99 , 102 ) . This seven - protein complex is the main mediator of de novo F - actin nucleation and F - actin branch assembly ( 36 ) . When activated , the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the side of an actin filament ( the mother filament ) and attaches , as a pointed - end capper , a monomeric ( G ) - actin subunit , the barbed end of which initiates the formation of a daughter fila - ment in a 70 - degree angle . This so - called dendritic nucleation leads to the formation of a branched actin meshwork ( 4 ) ( FIGURE 1B ) . Arp2 / 3 is activated by nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , the most impor - tant of which are the members of the WASP superfam - ily and cortactin . In vitro , cortactin is a substantially 353 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 21 • October 2006 • www . physiologyonline . org REVIEWS FIGURE 1 . The structure and interactions of cortactin A : the various functional domains are shown on top , whereas the different proteins cortactin binds to and the kinases that phosphorylate it are indi - cated at bottom . B : dendritic nucleation . The activated Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the side of a mother filament ( M ) to nucleate a daughter filament ( D ) . The schemes show two potential ( nonexclusive ) configurations of cortactin arrangement near the branch point . In both cases , the N terminus of cortactin binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex , whereas the F - actin binding repeats interact either with the daughter filament or with the mother filament as suggested in Refs . 93 and 98 , respectively . During the finalization of this review , Pant et al . ( 76 ) published a study in which they used electron micro - scopy and three - dimensional reconstruction to investigate the geometry of the interaction between purified actin and the cortactin N terminus . They found that binding of cortactin to actin subdomain - 1 widens the gap between the intertwining actin filaments . They propose a model in which cor - tactin binding to the mother filament might facilitate the recruitment of WASP at this locus . The COOH terminal SH3 domain can associate with a variety of partners ( X ) . b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 247 on J u l y 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m next sections ) as well . Moreover , although the concept that phosphorylation modifies the availability of SH3 is an attractive one , this does not have to be always negative for tyrosine and positive for serine phospho - rylation . Rather , phosphorylation may selectively alter the relative affinity for individual partners . Consistent with such a notion , tyrosine phosphorylation seems to promote the SH3 - dependent binding of cortactin to the adaptor protein CD2AP ( 63 ) , to myosin light - chain kinase ( MLCK ) ( 24 ) , and according to our preliminary data to dynamin . Furthermore , serine phosphoryla - tion in itself may be neither sufficient nor necessary to induce cortactin translocation to the cortical skeleton ( 42 ) . Conceivably , an initial assembly of the F - actin - Arp2 / 3 complex might be enough to recruit cortactin . In addition to regulating SH3 affinity , tyrosine phos - phorylation may promote SH2 domain - dependent interactions [ e . g . , with Fer and Src ( 50 , 73 ) ] and was suggested to decrease the actin cross - linking or bundling activity of cortactin ( 39 ) . However , the actin cross - linking capability of cortactin is disputed , and the molecular basis of such an effect is not clear ( 103 ) . Finally , tyrosine phosphorylation may also regulate the cellular level of cortactin , since the phosphorylat - ed form is preferentially degraded by the protease cal - pain ( 40 ) . What may be necessary for proper cortactin func - tion is not as much a net change in serine or tyrosine phosphorylation but a continuous cycle of phosphory - lation and dephosphorylation allowing the dynamic recycling of the protein . Thus we proposed that tyro - sine phosphorylation might be required to mobilize cortactin that had been incorporated into the F - actin meshwork ( 29 ) . This way cortactin may be liberated from the base of the lamellipodium , and after dephos - phorylation it may be re - incorporated at the rapidly protruding leading edge . Consistent with this model , actin organization per se impacts on cortactin phos - phorylation : actin depolymerization promotes Fer - mediated cortactin phosphorylation , whereas cor - tactin associated with F - actin seems to be less accessi - ble for tyrosine phosphorylation ( 29 ) . Future studies should test the phosphorylation - dependent recycling model . Cortactin at the Lamellipodia and the Leading Edge A variety of growth factors , e . g . , PDGF , EGF ( 48 , 101 ) , sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( 56 ) , shear stress ( 25 ) , and hyperosmotic shock ( 22 ) , send cortactin , presumably via the activation of the small GTPase Rac ( 101 ) , to the cell periphery and induce its accumulation in lamel - lipodia and membrane ruffles ( FIGURE 2A ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is not required for this process ( 22 , 33 ) ; rather , it might be a consequence of translocation ( 33 ) or independent from it ( 22 , 29 ) . Consistent with a functional role , cortactin overexpres - 354 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 21 • October 2006 • www . physiologyonline . org weaker activator of F - actin assembly than N - WASP ( 99 , 102 ) ; however , it has a unique property : it simulta - neously binds to F - actin ( as opposed to G - actin like the WASP members ) and thereby couples the Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization to an existing actin filament . In fact , cortactin has a 20 - fold higher affinity for F - actin than the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 94 ) . Conversely , cortactin has a much higher affinity for Arp2 / 3 once the latter has been associated with an actin filament ( 93 ) . Moreover , cortactin has a 15 - fold higher affinity for ATP / ADP - Pi - actin than for ADP - actin , which means that it preferentially binds to “young , ” i . e . , freshly incorporated , actin molecules ( 8 ) . Thus cor - tactin associates with the “hot spots” where the action takes place , i . e . , at branch points with rapidly poly - merizing daughter filaments . In addition to promoting nucleation and branching , it also stabilizes the newly formed branches ( 99 ) . There are a number of potential mechanisms whereby cortactin can stimulate Arp2 / 3 . First , it directly binds to Arp3 , inducing a conforma - tional change . Since its binding site is only partially overlapping with WASP ( 98 ) , WASP - cortactin - Arp2 / 3 may form a ternary complex . Alternatively , cortactin can replace WASP on Arp2 / 3 ( 93 ) , thereby stabilizing the branch and liberating WASP for a new cycle . A sec - ond mechanism is that cortactin binds WASP via its SH3 domain . The cortactin SH3 domain may also con - tribute by binding the WASP - activating WIP ( 51 ) and dynamin ( 82 ) , which has also been shown to enhance actin nucleation . Further fine tuning in regulation is provided by the G - actin - and cortactin - interacting protein MIM , which promotes cortactin - dependent but suppresses N - WASP - mediated actin polymeriza - tion . Thus MIM may modify cell motility by selecting among various Arp2 / 3 activators ( 59 ) . Finally , cor - tactin may recruit FGD1 , which via its GEF activity stimulates Cdc42 , a direct activator of WASP ( 49 ) . The question arises how cortactin phosphorylation affects its actin - nucleating activity . This is a simple question with no clear answer . There is no evidence that tyrosine ( or serine ) phosphorylation would directly affect the Arp2 / 3 - stimulating effect of cor - tactin . However , phosphorylation can modify the interaction of cortactin with other proteins , which may have a major impact . Recently , an “on - off switch” or “SY switch” paradigm has been put forward , according to which ERK - mediated serine phosphorylation ( S ) promotes , whereas Src - mediated tyrosine phosphory - lation ( Y ) inhibits , the SH3 - dependent interaction of cortactin with WASP and the consequent actin poly - merization ( 64 ) . This view assigns a negative ( off ) role for tyrosine phosphorylation , which is consistent with previous findings that osmotic stress - induced tyrosine phosphorylation promotes the disassembly of cor - tactin and Arp3 ( 22 ) . However , the picture is bound to be more complex since cortactin tyrosine phosphory - lation is associated with and appears to be necessary for many positive functions ( e . g . , invasiveness ; see REVIEWS b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 247 on J u l y 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m sion enhances cell migration ( 38 , 78 ) , tyrosine phos - phorylation - incompetent or SH3 - deleted mutants reduce the motility of fibroblasts and epithelial cells ( 38 , 54 ) , and siRNA - mediated cortactin downregula - tion inhibits cell migration and matrigel invasion of breast epithelial ( 95 ) or mammary carcinoma cells . These observations and the biochemical properties of cortactin would suggest that this protein is indispen - sable for lamellipodium formation and analogous phenomena such as cell spreading . However , rather surprisingly , the overall picture is not as clear and is not devoid of contradictions . For example , Bryce et al . ( 8 ) found that cortactin was necessary for lamellipodi - al persistence , i . e . , in the absence of cortactin , periph - eral protrusions were instable and rapidly retracted , consistent with a branch - stabilizing role . In contrast , Kempiak et al . ( 48 ) reported that , on cortactin down - regulation , mammary tumor cells exhibited enhanced lamellipod - like extension toward EGF - covered beads , although their overall motility was less . Furthermore , using the same cell type , it was found that cortactin downregulation resulted in near - normal EGF - induced lamellipod extension but delayed lamellipod retrac - tion ( S . Weed , personal communication ) , whereas our studies in the same system showed a grossly impaired lamellipod extension that was restored by cortactin re - transfection , an effect requiring both the critical tyrosines and the SH3 domain ( 17 ) . Moreover , Illes et al . ( 43 ) reported that siRNA - mediated reduction in cortactin caused 70 % inhibition of cell spreading , whereas van Rossum et al . ( 95 ) found that the absence of cortactin accelerated spreading and increased the overall spread area by 25 – 50 % . In this study , lamelli - pod extension was not affected by cortactin downreg - ulation , letting the authors conclude that cortactin is either not required for this process or the remaining cortactin after siRNA treatment might be sufficient . Thus , whereas everybody agrees that cortactin and its tyrosine phosphorylation are important for efficient cell migration , the role of cortactin in the subtleties of lamellipodial dynamics remains unresolved . In addi - tion to modifying F - actin dynamics at the tip of the leading edge , another way how cortactin might affect lamellipodial dynamics is via an impact on the assem - bly of focal adhesions at the base of the lamellipodi - um . Normal focal contacts appear to be required for the generation of a continuous , broad lamellipodium at the leading edge ( 91 ) , and cortactin downregulation decreased the rate of peripheral adhesion assembly as visualized by GFP - paxillin ( 8 ) . Nonetheless , as the above description shows , the topic is loaded with controversies . The reported dis - crepancies might be partially due to the extent of cor - tactin downregulation : conceivably , cortactin might be involved both in lamellipodial extension and retraction , but through distinct mechanisms that may exhibit different requirements in terms of cortactin concentration . Indeed , a recent study suggests that focal changes in cortactin concentration via cortactin degradation ( proteolysis ) might be an important regu - latory factor in cell motility , since the expression of calpain - resistant cortactin impaired cell migration and increased transient membrane protrusions ( 79 ) . Clearly , further research is warranted to define the role of cortactin at the leading edge . Cortactin at Invadopodia and Podosomes There is consensus with regard to the requirement of cortactin for invasiveness and for the formation and function of invadopodia . These structures are ventral membrane protrusions or finger - like processes that penetrate into the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and contain proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteases ( 66 ) ( FIGURE 2B ) . Cortactin is highly enriched in invadopodia where it forms a complex with paxillin and protein kinase C (cid:12) ( PKC (cid:12) ) . Importantly , microinjection of anti - cortactin antibod - ies suppressed matrix degradation at invadopodia ( 5 ) and cortactin downregulation inhibited the formation of these structures ( 1 ) . Cortactin is highly tyrosine phosphorylated in active invadopodia , and the level of its tyrosine phosphorylation shows a linear correlation with the concomitant matrix degradation ( 6 ) . Thus tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin appears to be a positive regulator of invasion . It remains an intriguing question how cortactin and its phosphorylation regulate invadopodia and the activity of matrix metal - loproteases . Podosomes are actin - rich structures that represent another type of matrix - cell surface interface . These structures , originally described in v - Src - transformed cells ( 9 , 60 ) , are composed of a core with columnar arrangement of F - actin and actin - binding proteins that protrude into the cytosol from the ventral surface . This region is surrounded by a ring containing pax - illin , vinculin , and talin , through which the core is anchored to integrins ( FIGURE 2C ) . In certain cases , these actin structures are arranged around long , intruding membrane tubules . Podosomes are also key sites of ECM remodeling : they are believed to seal off and modify portions of the ECM under the cell . Macrophages and osteoclasts are the richest in podosomes , but many other cell types also contain these structures . Podosome formation can be induced by active Src , PKC , or PAK ( 10 , 107 ) , and cortactin appears to be a key component in the process , since its knockdown inhibits podosome assembly ( 107 ) . Podosome genesis occurs in two phases : initially “pre - podosomal , ” cortactin - containing clusters occur near the end of stress fibers . Recruitment of cortactin to these precursor sites required an intact N - WASP - bind - ing SH3 domain . Cortactin then may facilitate the assembly of columnar F - actin structures . In this sec - ond phase , more cortactin was recruited to the 355 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 21 • October 2006 • www . physiologyonline . org REVIEWS b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 247 on J u l y 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 356 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 21 • October 2006 • www . physiologyonline . org REVIEWS FIGURE 2 . The playgrounds of cortactin Cortactin , as a key organizer and coordinator of cytoskeleton remodeling and membrane dynamics , accumulates in various functional hot spots . It is highly enriched in lamellipodia ( A ) , in which the branching F - actin meshwork pushes the membrane envelope of migrating cells . It is also necessary for the formation and function of invadopodia ( B ) and podosomes ( C ) , two important matrix - membrane interfaces . The presence of cortactin is required for the efficient recruitment of the matrix - degrading metalloproteases ( MMP ) to invadopodia ( B ) . In these structures , cortactin forms a com - plex with paxillin and protein kinase C ( PKC ) . In podosomes ( or foot processes ) , cortactin is a constituent of the central actin column ( core ) , which is connected to the matrix by a peripheral ring structure , composed of integrins , and adaptors proteins ( vinculin , paxillin ) . Cortactin is a dynamic regu - lator of the excitatory synapse as well ( D ) , where it links the adaptor protein Shank to the cytoskeleton . Shank is coupled to ionotropic ( I ) glutamate receptors through the postsynaptic density protein - 95 ( PSD ) and the guanylate kinase - associated protein ( GKAP ) , and to metabotropic ( M ) gluta - mate receptors through Homer . Cortactin ( via its tyrosine phosphorylation ) regulates the stability of the postsynaptic density . Cortactin is a key com - ponent of the endocytic machinery too ( E ) , where it may participate in the invagination of the forming endosomes and the coordination of this process with vesicle scission through interaction with dynamin . Subsequently , cortactin may contribute to the actin comet tail - driven intracellular movement of the formed vesicle . Cortactin has been implicated as a regulator of various intercellular junctions ( F ) . It associates with tight junctions ( TJ ) through Zonula occludens 1 ( ZO - 1 ) . Its role is better understood in adherens junctions ( AJ ) , composed of intercellular adhesion molecules cad - herins ( cad ) connected to the actin skeleton via (cid:2) - catenin ( (cid:2) ) and (cid:10) catenin ( (cid:10) ) . Currently , it is not clear whether cortactin associates with cadherins directly or through yet unidentified protein ( s ) ( designated with “ ? ” in the figure ) . Cortactin is important for cytoskeletal organization at the AJs , a requisite for junction formation and strengthening . Local tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Fer is required for this process . b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 247 on J u l y 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m growing podosome , but this time in a SH3 - independ - ent but F - actin binding region - dependent manner ( 100 ) . Cortactin becomes highly tyrosine phosphory - lated in podosomes , but this process is not necessary for cortactin recruitment ( 107 ) . Finally , cortactin has been implicated in local inhibition of contractility at the podosome by promoting the dispersion of myosin and tropomyosin at these sites ( 10 ) . The mechanism and significance of this phenomenon , as well as the way whereby cortactin contributes to the podosome func - tions ( e . g . , focal bone resorption ) are promising areas for future investigations . Indeed , while this paper was under review , Tehrani et al . ( 89 ) published an elegant study showing that siRNA - induced cortactin depletion in osteoclasts abolished podosome formation and bone resorption . These functions were shown to require cor - tactin tyrosine phosphorylation but not an intact SH3 domain . Cortactin at the Growth Cone and the Synapse Intriguing new research identifies cortactin as a cen - tral player in a number of neuron - specific functions including growth cone formation ( 15 , 23 ) , axon guid - ance ( path finding ) ( 52 , 53 ) , neuronal polarization ( 57 ) , dendritic spine morphogenesis ( synaptogenesis ) ( 35 ) , differential neurotransmitter ( GABA ) receptor expression ( 15 ) , and the modulation of voltage - gated K + channels ( 32 ) . Cortactin is enriched in growth cones of developing neurons ( 23 ) , and its suppression resulted in shorter processes and growth cones with enlarged filopodia ( 15 ) . Its tyrosine phosphorylation at this locus has been suggested to act as a signal for repulsive growth cone turning during EphA - receptor mediated retinal axon guidance ( 53 ) . Again , the picture is complex . For example , heparin - binding growth - associated mole - cule ( HB - GAM ) , an important neurite outgrowth - pro - moting protein and spatial cue involved in neuronal path finding , induced cortactin tyrosine phosphoryla - tion on binding to its receptor , N - syndecan . This event was associated with complex formation among N - syn - decan , cortactin , and Src , and was concomitant with enhanced neurite growth ( 52 ) . Thus , depending on the context , cortactin and its tyrosine phosphorylation may act as path - maintaining or repulsive signals . It has been raised that cortactin might also be involved in neuronal polarization , the intriguing process whereby a single neurite is selected to become the axon . A recent study indicates that Fer kinase is concentrated in growth cones , and inhibition of this enzyme delays the dendrite - axon conversion ( 57 ) . The two most important substrates of Fer in the growth cone are cortactin and p120 catenin [ or its relative (cid:8) - catenin , which was shown to associate with cor - tactin ( 65 ) ] . According to the current hypothesis , Fer - mediated phosphorylation might inhibit extensive actin filament branching , and this may be necessary for the rapid elongation of the forming axon . Cortactin may also play a role in regulating neurite branching : complex formation between (cid:8) - catenin and cortactin has been proposed to promote the extension of unbranched primary processes , whereas tyrosine phosphorylation disrupted this complex and resulted in enhanced branching in PC12 cells ( 65 ) . It remains a challenge to integrate and reconcile these findings with the mechanism of axon selection . A major step in our understanding of the role of cor - tactin at the synapse was the discovery that cortactin interacts with members of the Shank family , scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density ( 23 , 71 ) . Shank is located under the membrane linked to both ionotrop - ic and metabotropic glutamate receptors through var - ious adaptor proteins ( PSD - 95 , GKAP and Homer , respectively ) ( 26 ) . The proline - rich region of Shank binds to the SH3 domain of cortactin , thereby forming a multiprotein bridge between excitatory receptors and the cytoskeleton ( FIGURE 2D ) . In addition , cor - tactin plays a key role in the morphogenesis of den - dritic spines as verified by the findings that its down - regulation resulted in spine depletion , whereas its overexpression caused spine elongation ( 35 ) . The inter - action between cortactin and dynamin - 3 appears to be critical for dendritic spine maturation : the presence of this complex facilitates the formation of immature dendritic filopodia , whereas its disruption ( or dissoci - ation ) leads to formation of mature dendritic spines with postsynaptic densities ( 31 ) . Furthermore , synap - tic transmission is a dynamic regulator of cortactin distribution and therefore postsynaptic cytoskeleton organization . For example , NMDA receptor stimula - tion induced cortactin redistribution from the spine to the shaft ( 35 ) , an effect due to Src family - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin ( 41 ) , whereas brain - derived neurotrophic factor triggered ERK - mediated serine phosphorylation of cortactin , con - comitant with its translocation from the shaft to the spines ( 41 ) . These fascinating findings suggest that cortactin is involved in the function - dependent remodeling of the synapse : overstimulation of NMDA receptors removes cortactin and thereby collapses dendritic spines , which may serve as a negative feed - back mechanism . In contrast , neurotrophic factors use cortactin to solidify synaptic transmission . In addition , cortactin was reported to interact with the Kv1 . 2 K + channel in a tyrosine phosphorylation - dependent manner , and this interaction may modify the acetyl - 357 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 21 • October 2006 • www . physiologyonline . org REVIEWS “ Intriguing new research identifies cortactin as a central player in a number of neuron - specific functions . . . ” b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 247 on J u l y 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m invasive phenotype of cortactin - overexpressing tumor cells ( 92 ) . Finally , it is worth mentioning that the dynamin - cortactin interaction is not limited to the endocytic machinery ; in fact , these proteins colocalize also in the Golgi - apparatus ( 13 ) , invadopodia , podosomes , and lamellipodia ( 75 ) . As mentioned , dynamin facilitates the actin - nucleating effect of cor - tactin ( 82 ) , and it has a substantial impact on lamel - lipodial kinetics and cell shape determination ( 55 , 67 ) . Furthermore , our ongoing studies suggest that in lamellipodia cortactin might recruit dynamin ( and not the other way around as at the CCP ) and that their interaction may be facilitated by tyrosine phosphory - lation . Clearly , the dynamin - cortactin complex is a key component of the interplay between membrane dynamics and cytoskeleton remodeling . Cortactin at Intercellular Junctions Cortactin also participates in the organization of at least two major types of intercellular contacts : TJs and adherens junctions ( AJ ) ( FIGURE 2F ) . TJs are com - posed of transmembrane contact proteins such as the occludins and their intracellular binding partners , predominantly the members of the zonula occludens ( ZO ) family ( 87 ) . TJs separate the apical and the baso - lateral membrane compartments , and the tightness of these structures determines transepithelial electrical resistance ( TER ) and paracellular transport . The cor - tactin SH3 domain has been shown to bind to the pro - line - rich region of ZO - 1 . Although little is known about the function of cortactin at the TJ , some func - tional studies support a positive role . Sphingosine - 1 phosphate induced barrier enhancement ( i . e . , an increase in TER ) in lung epithelial cells , which seemed to be mediated by Rac - dependent peripheral translo - cation of cortactin and MLCK . Downregulation of cor - tactin or elimination of its tyrosine phosphorylation prevented this effect ( 25 ) . The barrier - enhancing role of the cortactin - MLCK complex is an intriguing find - ing since increased myosin - based contractility usually reduces epithelial tightness . Future studies should address whether this effect is related to ZO - 1 . Recently , ZO - 1 was also detected in the leading edge of fibroblasts migrating in a wound , where it was sug - gested to initiate integrin - dependent adhesion com - plexes ( 88 ) . AJs are composed of cadherins , which are homotyp - ic transmembrane adhesion molecules linked to intra - cellular plaque proteins , (cid:2) - catenin and then (cid:10) - catenin , which in turn anchor the complex to the actin skeleton ( 90 ) . Recently , cortactin was found to associate with E - cadherin ( epithelial cells ) and N - cad - herin ( fibroblasts ) in nascent AJs . In epithelial cells , cortactin preferentially accumulated at the extending margins of cadherin - containing adhesive contact zones . Downregulation of cortactin or transfection with actin - or Arp2 / 3 - binding deficient cortactin 358 PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 21 • October 2006 • www . physiologyonline . org choline - induced currents ( 32 ) . Thus cortactin regu - lates ion channels and dynamically modifies synapses , which may play a role in synaptic plasticity and long - term potentiation . Indeed , evidence is accumulating that cortactin impacts on complex functions such as learning and sleep ( 20 , 68 ) . Clearly , the neuronal career of cortactin has only started . Cortactin at Endocytic Vesicles The recognition that cortactin may play a role in endo - cytosis stemmed from two pioneering observations . The first was that cortactin associates with endocytic vesicles in an asymmetric manner , such that it accu - mulates on one pole of the vesicle , consistent with a role in actin polymerization - propelled intracellular trafficking of endosomes ( 45 ) . The second finding was that cortactin binds to the proline - rich domain of dynamin , a large GTPase that pinches off the forming endocytic vesicle ( 67 ) . The role of cortactin was then solidified by findings that 1 ) it accumulates at the clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) and 2 ) microinjection of anti - cortactin antibodies ( 12 ) , siRNA - induced knock - down ( 14 , 108 ) , or the overexpression of the isolated SH3 domain inhibits endocytosis ( 12 ) . Endocytosis is a complex process involving pit formation , invagina - tion , scission , and vesicle movement away from the membrane . Recent studies shed some light on cor - tactin’s involvement in these particular steps . Merrifield et al . ( 69 ) studied the dynamics of individ - ual CCPs using evanescent field microscopy and a witty technique , the pH - sensitive labeling of transfer - rin receptors , with which the closure and scission of CCPs can be resolved in real time . They found that cor - tactin starts accumulating early on at the forming pit , and its peak recruitment is coincident with scission . They propose that cortactin , by inducing local actin polymerization , promotes pit invagination , which facilitates efficient scission . Cortactin is not found in every forming pit , so it may mark a subset of CCPs . The role and mode of the cortactin - dynamin interaction is also emerging . It seems that dynamin can accumulate in an F - actin - independent manner and then recruits cortactin to the pit ( 14 ) . Interestingly , cortactin engaged in actin polymerization ( i . e . , associated with F - actin and Arp2 / 3 ) has an eightfold higher affinity for dynamin ( 108 ) . This means that dynamin will localize spots of active actin polymerization to the pit , which may be a central mechanism to coordinate invagina - tion and subsequent fission ( FIGURE 2E ) . Moreover , the role of the cortactin - dynamin complex is not limit - ed to clathrin - mediated endocytosis , as inhibition of these molecules suppresses the clathrin - independent endocytosis of (cid:3) c cytokine receptors ( 80 ) too . Cortac - tin seems to affect the fate of the endocytosed recep - tors as well . Remarkably , its overexpression inhibited the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of the EGF receptor , an effect that might contribute to the REVIEWS b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 247 on J u l y 6 , 2017 h tt p : / / ph ys i o l og y on li ne . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m mutants , but not with tyrosine phosphorylation - incompetent mutants , inhibited contact zone exten - sion between neighboring cells ( 34 ) . These results suggest that cortactin participates in the biogenesis of epithelial AJs , presumably by regulating peripheral actin assembly , and thus membrane dynamics , neces - sary for the interaction of contact - forming cells ( 2 ) . In fibroblast , N - cadherin engagement initiated transient Rac - dependent cortactin recruitment to the nascent contacts along with Fer kinase - mediated cortactin phosphorylation at this locus . Using N - cadherin - cov - ered beads and shear wash - off assays , we showed that both the presence of cortactin and its tyrosine phos - phorylation are critical for providing adhesion strength for the newly formed contacts ( 27 , 28 ) . Fer - mediated cortactin phosphorylation increased N - cad - herin mobility , which may be required for N - cadherin clustering and contact zone extension . These findings render cortactin a key regulator of AJ formation and adhesion strength . In addition , cortactin may regulate the permeability and dynamics of mature AJs as well , since downregulation of cortactin in endothelial cells impaired the transmigration of polymorphonulear leukocyets through the monolayer ( 106 ) . Cortactin at Sites of Cell - Pathogen Interactions Cortactin has also emerged as a common target of pathogen - host cell interactions . Depending on the particular microbe , cortactin has been implicated in adhesion ( e . g . , pedestal formation by enteropathogen - ic an enterohemorrhagic Esherichia coli ) , invasion ( Shigella , Neisseria , Chlamydia , Rickettsia , Staphylococcus , Crytosporodium ) , intracellular move - ment ( actin polymerization - propelled motility , using actin comet tails by Listeria , Shigella , and vaccinia virus ) , and cell scattering ( Helicobacter ) . All these processes harness the actin cytoskeleton of the host in various ways ( 86 ) . Intriguingly the effect on tyrosine phosphorylation is pathogen dependent , with robust increase ( e . g . , Shigella ) , no change ( e . g . , Chlamydia ) , or decrease ( Helicobacter ) . Details of this rich and important topic go beyond the scope of the present paper , so the interested reader is referred to a recent excellent review ( 85 ) . Cortactin in the Future What can then be , if not the Holy Grail , at least the uni - fying principle underlying this wide diversity of poten - tial functions , extending from cell migration / invasion through synaptic plasticity to intercellular contacts and more ? Although only the future can provide a bet - ter insight , it seems likely that cortactin is one of those important molecular integrators that participate in the conversion of external ( ligand - induced or mechani - cal ) cues to appropriate membrane responses by organizing the cytoskeleton to execute the “desired” membrane remodeling . Progress in the following years is likely to solidify the link between the bio - chemistry and the physiology of cortactin . We hope to learn the molecular details whereby cortactin regu - lates cell migration , controls proteolysis during metas - tasis , and modifies intercellular contacts . We also hope to learn what exactly its tyrosine phosphoryla - tion is doing . Moreover , cortactin will teach us about fundamental relationships between processes that today we view as separate entities . Thus it will help us to address the link and coordination between endo - or exocytosis and lamellipodial dynamics , or between cell migration and intercellular contact formation . There is little doubt that the gray eminence will con - tinue to intrigue us . (cid:132) We are indebted to Dr . Katalin Szászi for critical reading of the manuscript . L . I .
