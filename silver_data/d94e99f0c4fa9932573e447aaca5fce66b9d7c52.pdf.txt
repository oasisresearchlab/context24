Key 17 steps of endocytic carrier formation are cargo molecule selection , plasma membrane folding and detachment 18 from the cell surface . While dedicated proteins mediate each step , the actin cytoskeleton contributes to all . 19 However , its role can be indirect to the actual molecular events driving endocytosis . Here , we review our 20 understanding of the molecular steps mediating local actin polymerization during the formation of endocytic 21 carriers . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the least reliant on local actin polymerization , as it is only 22 engaged to counter forces induced by membrane tension or cytoplasmic pressure . Two opposite situations 23 are coated pit formation in yeast and at the basolateral surface of polarized mammalian cells which are 24 respectively dependent and independent on actin polymerization . Conversely , Clathrin - independent 25 endocytosis ( CIE ) forming both nanometer ( CLIC / GEEC , caveolae , FEME , IL2 β uptake ) and micrometer 26 carriers ( macropinocytosis ) are dependent on actin polymerization to power local membrane deformation 27 and carrier budding . A variety of endocytic adaptors can recruit and activate the Cdc42 / N - WASP or 28 Rac1 / WAVE complexes , which in turn engage the Arp2 / 3 complex , thereby mediating local actin 29 polymerization at the membrane . However , the molecular steps for RhoA and formin - mediated actin bundling 30 during endocytic pit formation remains unclear . 31 32 Introduction 33 Extracellular macromolecules and transmembrane cell surface proteins cannot diffuse across the plasma 34 membrane and require transport by endocytic carriers to enter cells . Such carriers are formed upon wrapping 35 of the plasma membrane around the material to be internalized , generically named ‘cargoes’ . Clathrin - 36 mediated endocytosis ( henceforth , CME ) is the best - characterized endocytic route and the dominant uptake 37 pathway to sustain housekeeping functions in cells ( 1 - 3 ) . Several Clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) 38 mechanisms exist in parallel to CME to mediate bulk protein and lipid uptake and removal of specific 39 receptors from the plasma membrane ( 4 , 5 ) . Beside ligand and protein uptake , endocytosis controls cell 40 spreading , polarization and migration . Consistently , endocytosis is involved in several diseases such as 41 cancer , neurodegeneration , lysosomal storage disease and atherosclerosis . It is also hijacked by many 42 bacteria , viruses , prions and bacterial toxins to mediate their cellular entry ( 6 ) . 43 Once detached from the surface , endocytic carriers have three broad shapes : small spherical 44 vesicles ( 50 - 200 nm diameter ) , tubules ( 50 - 500 nm diameter and up to 1 - 5 µ m in length ) and large endocytic 45 vacuoles called macropinosomes ( 0 . 5 to > 10 µ m ) . To date , we know of three main molecular mechanisms 46 by which endocytic carriers form : i ) cargo capture and local membrane bending by cytosolic proteins ; ii ) 47 extracellular lipid or cargo clustering according to the Glycolipid - Lectin ( GL - Lect ) hypothesis ; and iii ) acute 48 signaling - induced membrane protrusions folding back onto the plasma membrane ( 5 ) . Both CME and CIE 49 processes , such as fast Endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) or Interleukin - 2 receptor β ( IL2R β ) uptake , 50 rely on cytosolic proteins such as Clathrin or BAR domain - containing proteins that bend membrane upon 51 local recruitment and polymerization . Bin1 / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( BAR ) domains are dimeric curved 52 structures with a positively charged concave surface that senses , stabilizes and induces membrane 53 curvature ( 7 ) . Extracellular lipid or cargo clustering drives the formation of Clathrin - independent carriers / 54 Glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored protein enriched endocytic compartments ( CLIC / GEEC , 55 hereafter CLIC ) and the uptake of Shiga and cholera toxins ( 8 ) . Membrane protrusions folding back onto the 56 plasma membrane create large carriers during macropinocytosis and activity - dependent bulk endocytosis 57 ( ADBE ) at synapses ( 9 , 10 ) . 58 The energetic cost of deforming a membrane depends mainly on its rigidity . Thus , the energy 59 required to form an endocytic carrier is not dependent on its size but is instead the result of the local 60 membrane rigidity . In the case of a biological membrane that has a typical bending modulus of 10 - 20 k B T 61 ( where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature ) , about 250 - 500 k B T ( being the energy produced 62 by the hydrolysis of 10 - 20 ATP molecules ) must be produced to form a vesicle ( 11 ) . Although Clathrin and its 63 adaptor proteins can bend the plasma membrane locally to produce coated vesicles , additional forces 64 provided by the actin cytoskeleton are required in some physiological contexts to counter membrane tension 65 or internal cytoplasmic pressure . Two opposite situations are coated pit formation at the basolateral surface 66 of polarized mammalian cells ( independent of actin ) and endocytosis in yeast ( dependent of actin ) ( 12 - 14 ) . 67 Perhaps because of their larger sizes , their speed of formation or the absence of dense and rigid 68 proteinaceous coats around CIE carriers , their formations rely on actin polymerization ( 15 ) . 69 Actin transitions between a monomeric globular form ( G - actin ) and a polymeric filamentous form ( F - actin ) 70 upon ATP loading . Actin polymerizes into helical , two - stranded filaments , the slow - and fast - growing ends of 71 which are named ‘pointed’ and ‘barbed’ ends , respectively . Actin filaments can be crosslinked ( e . g . cortical 72 actin ) , bundled together ( e . g . filopodia ) or branch into extended network ( e . g . lamellipodia ) ( 16 ) . This network 73 of filaments forms the actin cytoskeleton , performing multiple functions in cells , from providing structural 74 support to membranes to propelling organelles ( 17 ) . As actin monomers are in vast excess in cells , the 75 availability of uncapped ( free ) barbed ends is rate limiting for the growth of actin filaments . While actin 76 filament capping , cross - linking ( e . g . Fimbrin , Fascin , α - actinin , Spectrin , Filamin and Myosin ) , elongating 77 ( e . g . ENA / VASP ) , severing and depolymerizing proteins ( e . g . Gelsolin , Severin , ADF / Cofilin ) are all 78 important regulators , the growth of the actin network is stimulated by regulated nucleation ( 18 - 20 ) . Formins 79 and the Arp2 / 3 complex are the main actin assembly - promoting factors . Branched filaments can only be 80 nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , which serves as a template to trigger the polymerization of a new filament 81 at a 70 degree angle from the original one ( 21 ) . As Arp2 / 3 has minimal basal activity , nucleation - promoting 82 factors ( NPF ) such as the WASP / N - WASP and the SCAR / WAVE complexes are required to induce strong 83 branching and nucleation ( 18 , 19 , 22 ) . In the cytosol , N - WASP is auto - inhibited , while WAVE is constitutively 84 active but inhibited in trans by the WAVE - regulatory complex ( WRC ) . Both complexes need to be recruited 85 and activated by additional proteins to induce local actin polymerization . RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 are 86 membrane - bound GTPases that trigger local actin polymerization upon recruitment and activation . GTP - 87 bound Rac1 and Cdc42 activate Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin branching through the WASP / N - WASP and 88 SCAR / WAVE complexes , respectively . RhoA activates formins such as mDia . 89 While many publications have reported a requirement for actin in endocytosis , the evidence was 90 often limited to its perturbation upon actin depolymerization or stabilization ( Cytochalasin D , Latrunculin or 91 Jasplakinolide treatments ) . The effects of actin cytoskeleton perturbation on endocytosis could be very 92 indirect ( e . g . changes in membrane tension , receptor clustering and lateral diffusion or membrane fluidity ) . 93 Thus , this review will focus on the discrete molecular events driving local actin polymerization during 94 endocytic carrier formation . 95 96 Localized actin polymerization during nanometer carrier budding . 97 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Even though a functional actin cytoskeleton is present at each stage of 98 clathrin coated pit ( CCP ) formation in mammalian cells ( 1 ) , its function is dispensable upon low membrane 99 tension ( 12 , 23 - 26 ) . In such cases , forces generated by the polymerization of the clathrin coat , aided by 100 membrane bending activity of adaptors such as Epsin , AP180 or BAR - domain proteins , are sufficient to form 101 clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) without the assistance of local actin polymerization ( 1 , 2 ) . However , actin is 102 required to counteract high membrane tension at apical or adherent surfaces of cells ( where the membrane 103 is stretched by the underlying cytoskeleton ) , during mitosis , in hypo - osmotic environments or because of 104 mechanical stress ( 12 , 27 , 28 ) . Actin polymerization is also required for the internalization of large cargoes 105 into CCVs , such as elongated VSV viruses ( 29 ) . Finally , it is crucial for CME in yeast , as inward budding 106 needs to overcome the outwardly directed turgor pressure of ∼ 1 , 000 pN and the stiff , ergosterol - rich , 107 membrane ( 30 ) . Actin is even more important than Clathrin for receptor - mediated endocytosis in yeast as 108 uptake continues , albeit at reduced rate , even in the absence of Clathrin ( 31 , 32 ) . This is not the case in 109 mammals , where Clathrin and AP2 are obligatory for CME ( 33 , 34 ) . 110 Actin is consistently found both at the periphery of the clathrin lattice during budding and at the neck 111 of constricted CCPs , forming a ring - like collar ( 26 , 35 ) . Thereby , local actin polymerization is believed to push 112 budding vesicles away from the cell cortex and to assist invagination and membrane fission . Actin networks 113 at endocytic sites are rapidly turned over ( every 3 - 4 seconds ) , being assembled and dissembled 114 concurrently upon actin nucleation , elongation , severing and depolymerisation ( 14 , 36 ) . Although the 115 mechanisms of carrier formation are different during yeast and mammalian CME , that of local actin 116 polymerization around CCPs shares similarities . Complete and recent accounts of actin nucleation at yeast 117 endocytic patches are available in excellent reviews ( 14 , 37 ) ; we focus instead on summarising the 118 commonalities and differences in mechanisms in fungi and mammals . 119 In yeast , Las17 ( WASP in mammals ) and Pan1 ( Intersectin ) , are kept inhibited locally by proteins 120 arriving at early sites of CCPs , such as the F - BAR domain protein Syp1 ( FCHo1 and 2 ) , Sla1 ( also related to 121 Intersectin ) and Sla2 ( Hip1 / Hip1R ) ( Figure 1a ) ( 38 - 41 ) . Syp1 disappears from CCPs just before the onset of 122 actin assembly , at a time when Bzz1 ( Syndapin / PACSIN ) is recruited ( 40 , 42 - 44 ) . Bzz1 competes with Sla1 123 to bind and activate Las17 ( 45 ) . Ent1 ( Epsin ) can also activate Las17 and Pan1 to recruit Arp2 / 3 and initiate 124 local actin branching and nucleation ( 46 ) . Actin polymerisation emanates from a Las17 ring around the 125 center of the budding vesicle ( 47 ) . Cdc15 ( PSTPIP1 ) assembles with Myo1 ( Myosin ) and remains close to 126 the cell surface at the base of the forming tube , whereas Bzz1 and Las17 move away from the plasma 127 membrane with the invaginating tubule ( 48 ) . Thereby , Cdc15 and Bzz1 create two distinct actin 128 polymerisation sites at CCPs . 129 In mammals , less is known about actin polymerization during the initiation stage , but N - WASP , 130 Arp2 / 3 , actin and Syndapin 2 levels at CCPs increase when that of FCHo1 / 2 decreases ( 44 , 49 ) . Intersectin 1 131 and 2 may assume the functions of both Pan1 and Sla1 by recruiting N - WASP via their SH3 domains , in 132 addition to acting as a guanine - nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) towards the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 133 ( Figure 1a ) ( 50 , 51 ) . The SH3 domains of intersectin can also interact with the basic rich ( BR ) domain of 134 Cdc42 GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) thereby inhibiting their GAP activity ( Figure 1a ) ( 52 ) . Active 135 Cdc42 recruits FBP17 , CIP4 and TOCA - 1 , which in turn activate N - WASP via their SH3 domains ( 53 , 54 ) . 136 However , as these F - BAR proteins have been detected after vesicle scission , this suggests that they may 137 activate actin polymerization involved in the propulsion of budded CCV ( 44 ) . 138 In both yeast and mammals , Sla2 and Hip1 proteins do not promote actin polymerisation but instead 139 regulate the association of the actin cytoskeleton to budding CCPs ( 55 - 57 ) . Their N - terminal ANTH domain 140 associates with the Epsin ENTH domain at the plasma membrane , whereas their central coil - coiled region 141 binds to clathrin light chains ( CLCs ) ( 58 , 59 ) . Clathrin binding causes a conformational switch of Hip1 / R , 142 which blocks its binding to actin ( Figure 1b ) ( 60 , 61 ) . In addition , Hip1R ( but not Hip1 ) associates to 143 Cortactin via its C - terminal PR domain and inhibits local actin assembly by blocking the elongation of barbed 144 ends ( 57 , 62 , 63 ) . This suggests a mechanism whereby actin is excluded from the coat and restricted to the 145 rim and neck of the budding vesicle , where Hip1 / R is not recruited by Clathrin ( Figure 1b ) ( 61 , 64 ) . 146 At the last stages , Epsin and the BAR domain proteins Amphiphysin , Endophilin ( Rvs161 and 147 Rvs167 in yeast ) and SNX9 mediate the constriction of the neck by membrane curvature via their ENTH and 148 BAR domains respectively , and local actin polymerization through their recruitment of N - WASP ( Figure 1c ) 149 ( 65 - 69 ) . These BAR domain proteins also concentrate Dynamin ( Vps1 in yeast ) at the neck , which 150 polymerizes into ring - like structures to mediate vesicle fission upon GTP hydrolysis ( 70 - 72 ) . Dynamin 151 assembly is facilitated by short , gelsolin - capped actin - filaments and its polymerisation in turn enhances its 152 GTPase activity , which removes gelsolin from barbed actin ends and allows elongation of F - actin filaments 153 ( 73 - 75 ) . F - actin polymerisation also stimulates dynamin binding to Cortactin in an Arp2 / 3 - dependent manner , 154 which allows for dynamin GTPase - mediated local actin cytoskeleton remodelling ( 76 , 77 ) . In yeast , however , 155 Vps1 may be less crucial for scission than Dynamin is in mammals , as actin - generated forces , Rvs161 / 167 156 and local lipid modifications appear sufficient ( 14 ) . Finally , unconventional Type I Myosin motors - such as 157 Myo3 / 5 in yeast and Myosin 1E and VI in mammals - generate local forces which push coated pits into the 158 cytosol ( 42 , 44 , 78 ) . 159 The orientation of the actin filaments around CCPs is not yet clear . Consistent with the location of 160 the nucleating machinery , polymerization is constrained at the membrane ( 26 , 35 , 79 - 81 ) . Electron 161 tomography and local actin bleaching experiments revealed that actin filaments grow towards the yeast cell 162 cortex ( Figure 1b - c ) , forming a roughly spherical 3D network at the bottom of the invagination ( 26 , 31 , 81 ) . 163 However , Las17 was also reported to move in with the membrane invagination ( 79 , 82 ) , consistent with the 164 late arrival of N - WASP - binding proteins in mammals , and with the branching of actin filaments transitioning 165 towards constricted CCPs at later stages ( Figure 1c - d ) ( 26 ) . Thus , actin polymerization occurs at several 166 locations on budding CCVs and the precise details are still unclear . 167 168 Clathrin - independent endocytosis . Actin polymerization is key to the formation and budding of many 169 nanometer - scale CIE carriers including CLICs , caveolae , FEME and IL - 2R β - containing vesicles . 170 Extracellular clustering of lipids and proteins by the GL - Lect mechanism drives initial CLIC formation without 171 the need for actin polymerization ( 8 ) . Instead , Arf1 recruits ARHGAP10 to disactivate Cdc42 ( Figure 2a ) 172 ( 83 ) , perhaps to release the local membrane tension that could be imposed by the underlying actin 173 cytoskeleton . Nascent CLICs are then recognized by the cytosolic BAR domain containing proteins GRAF1 174 or Endophilin ( 84 , 85 ) . Precise spatio - temporal regulation of Cdc42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin 175 polymerization during CLIC formation is mediated by the GAP domain of GRAF1 ( Figure 2a ) ( 84 ) . Additional 176 mechanisms may be involved in actin polymerization around Shiga and cholera toxin - containing CLICs ( that 177 are less dependent on GRAF1 ) , as Endophilin can bind to N - WASP and to additional Cdc42 GAPs such as 178 Oligophrenin , BPGAP1 and RICH1 ( 86 - 88 ) . Finally , forces generated by actin polymerization ( 84 , 89 , 90 ) and 179 by friction - driven scission generated by BAR proteins ( 85 , 91 ) mediate the scission of CLICs and detachment 180 from the cell surface . 181 Cholesterol - binding and membrane inserted proteins Caveolin - 1 to 3 associate with cytosolic 182 proteins Cavin 1 - 4 to form a coat which shape caveolae into their characteristic 50 - 100 nm cave - like 183 invaginations ( 92 , 93 ) . Caveolae bud from the plasma membrane at low frequency and traffic back and forth 184 to early endosomes . They also function as mechano - sensing domains , whereby membrane stretching 185 induces their flattening and buffers mechanical stress ( 94 , 95 ) . Consistent with this , caveolae are often found 186 aligned with some actin stress fibers ( 96 ) . The molecular links are still unclear but RhoA , filamin A ( which 187 binds to Caveolin 1 ( 97 ) ) , Myosin 1c ( which interacts with Cavin 3 ( 98 ) ) and perhaps EHD2 and Pacsin 2 188 ( 99 ) are all required . Furthermore , reduction of actin stress fibers by Cytochalasin D or mDia1 and Abl 189 kinases silencing decreases their association to caveolae ( 100 ) . 190 In the case of FEME , actin - dependent initiation sites pre - exist receptor activation and carrier 191 formation . Lamellipodin recruits and concentrates Endophilin into distinct patches on the plasma membrane 192 ( 101 , 102 ) . In the absence of receptor activation , these patches disassemble after 5 - 10 seconds and new 193 ones form nearby , constantly probing the membrane . It appears that active actin remodeling is required as 194 very low doses of actin poisons ( one or two orders of magnitude less than the concentration required to 195 block CME ) , applied for few seconds only , are sufficient to disrupt the formation of Lamellipodin - Endophilin 196 patches and to inhibit FEME ( 101 ) . PI3K , Rac1 , Cdc42 , N - WASP and PAK1 and 2 all regulate the formation 197 of FEME carriers . However , details of the coordination of membrane bending and actin polymerization are so 198 far missing ( Figure 2b ) . The N - BAR domain of Endophilin induces extensive membrane tubulation and 199 vesicle formation at high local concentration as it contains two amphipathic helices , thereby combining 200 protein scaffolding with hydrophobic insertion ( 67 , 103 ) . A synergy between : ( i ) actin polymerization ; ( ii ) 201 dynein - mediated traction on microtubules ; ( iii ) Dynamin ; and ( iv ) friction - driven scission generated by the 202 BAR domain or Endophilin , is required for FEME carrier scission ( 85 , 91 , 104 ) . 203 IL - 2R β or γ c chains expressed ectopically in non - immune cells are constitutively internalized in small 204 ( 200 - 500 nm ) clathrin - independent carriers ( 105 , 106 ) . Unlike FEME , where cytosolic adaptors recruit 205 activated receptors , IL - 2R β recruits the actin - nucleating complex WAVE1 . Similar to several other receptors , 206 IL - 2R β has a WIRS motif in its cytoplasmic tail that binds to a surface composed of Sra1 and Abi2 in the 207 WAVE1 complex ( Figure 2c ) ( 107 , 108 ) . Clustering of IL - 2R β chains during their concentration into nascent 208 pits might therefore recruit enough copies of WAVE1 , followed by N - WASP , to induce Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin 209 protrusions that fall back onto the membrane to form endocytic pits around them ( Figure 2c ) ( 107 ) . PI3K 210 recruitment by clustered IL - 2R β , local PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 production and Rac1 - mediated WAVE and PAK - 1 and - 2 211 activation are also important for local actin polymerization and endocytic carrier formation ( Figure 2c ) 212 ( 109 , 110 ) . Although reminiscent of macropinocytosis , actin polymerization and membrane projections 213 around IL - 2R β remain localized , creating small and spherical carriers . The molecular basis for this 214 confinement and the absence of extended actin polymerization is not yet understood . 215 Finally , other CIE processes that rely on RhoA - and formin - dependent actin polymerization exist 216 both in yeast and mammalian cells ( 111 , 112 ) . However , how linear actin cables power endocytic carrier 217 formation remains unknown . 218 219 Local actin polymerization during micrometer carrier formation 220 Macropinocytosis relies critically on actin polymerization to power membrane ruffles , which then form micron - 221 wide vacuoles . It mediates the bulk intake of extracellular fluids and molecules , as well as sizable portions of 222 the cell surface ( 9 , 113 ) . At highly stimulated synapses , activity - dependent bulk endocytosis ( ADBE ) is the 223 dominant mode of endocytosis and shares features with macropinocytosis ( 10 , 114 ) . In both cases , elevated 224 and sustained signaling emanating from activated receptors induces the localized actin polymerization 225 underneath large membrane ruffles . These fold back onto the cell surface to produce large ( 0 . 5 to > 10 µ m ) 226 endocytic carriers . The formation of membrane extensions relies exclusively on constant actin remodeling 227 and low doses of actin poisons are sufficient to hinder endocytosis . 228 Initially , activated receptors and Ras ( Ras - GTP ) both recruit and activate phosphoinositides 3 - kinases 229 ( PI3Ks ) that produce localized patches of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 upon phosphorylation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure 3 ) ( 115 ) . 230 PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 has a central role in triggering actin polymerization . First , electrostatic interactions between the 231 negative charges of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and polybasic motifs within Rac1 and Cdc42 recruit and activate them at 232 precise locations on the plasma membrane . Consistently , inhibiting PI3K or accumulating cytosolic H + ( by 233 preventing Na + / H + transfer across the plasma membrane using amiloride , or its 5 - ( N - Ethyl - N - isopropyl ) 234 amiloride ( EIPA ) derivative ) neutralizes negative charges of the inner membrane leaflet and blocks ruffling 235 and macropinocytosis ( 116 ) . Active Rac and Cdc42 also stimulate PAK family kinases , which support 236 sustained actin reorganization and membrane ruffling ( Figure 3 ) , mostly by inactivating MLC kinase ( which 237 activates Myosin ) and activating LIMK kinase ( which inactivates the actin depolymerization factor Cofilin ) 238 ( 117 ) . Formins ( mDia ) and myosins are also involved in bundling actin and forming finger - like protrusions 239 ( filopodia ) at the edge of macropinocytic cups ( 9 , 113 ) . Second , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 recruits phospholipases ( PLC ) 240 that hydrolyze PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 locally into inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) ( Figure 3 ) . IP 3 241 and DAG then activate protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( Figure 3 ) , which is a potent activator of actin polymerization 242 ( 118 ) . It does so mainly by activating Src , which in turn activates p190RhoGAP and thus downregulates 243 RhoA , thereby promoting Cdc42 and Rac1 activities ( 119 ) . Third , local dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 into 244 PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by SHIP1 or 2 recruits actin remodeling proteins such as Lamellipodin and the BAR domain - 245 containing SNX9 ( Figure 3 ) ( 120 , 121 ) . SNX9 locally recruits and activates Cdc42 and N - WASP promoting 246 actin branching ( 122 ) . Lamellipodin recruits the actin elongation factors ENA / VASP to mediate the extension 247 of the branched filaments ( 120 ) , thereby supporting the expansion of the actin network underneath 248 membrane ruffles ( Figure 3 ) . GTP - loaded Rac1 and Cdc42 are switched off by several GTPase activating 249 proteins ( GAPs ) , including ARHGAP12 , ARHGAP25 and SH3BP1 ( 123 ) , thereby terminating actin 250 polymerization . Thus , during macropinocytosis , local actin polymerization is propagated , generating 251 membrane ruffles that form micrometer size endocytic carriers . 252 253 Perspectives and remaining challenges 254 Actin polymerization powers endocytic carriers that form either rapidly , under high membrane tension or 255 without the aid of dense and rigid proteinaceous coats . The actin branching complex Arp2 / 3 , recruited either 256 by Cdc42 / N - WASP or Rac1 / WAVE , is locally recruited by a variety of endocytic adaptors , thereby linking 257 membrane bending and actin polymerization . Upstream events such as the local recruitment and activation 258 of Cdc42 and Rac1 by GEFs ( such as the ones of the Intersectin , ELMO , VAV , DOCK families ) are not well 259 known . Arf1 and Arf6 proteins , known to take part in CME and CIE , might be involved ( 124 ) . The molecular 260 steps for RhoA - and formin - mediated actin bundling during endocytic pit formation are also not well 261 understood . An outstanding question remains how actin polymerization is confined during nanometer 262 endocytic carrier formation and propagated laterally on the membrane during macropinocytosis . The precise 263 spatio - temporal mapping of actin polymerization is still missing , in particular during nanometer CIE carrier 264 formation . It is evident that the actin networks assembled are very dynamic and turn over multiple times over 265 the lifetime of the carrier formation . However , the mechanisms of actin network dissolution and local filament 266 dynamics are not well understood . The polarity of actin filaments and any potential transition from pushing to 267 propelling forces during carrier budding are also not clear . Another important issue for further study will be to 268 understand how endocytic carriers move in the opposite orientation to the existing actin network . Dense 269 cross - linked cortical actin or branched extended network underlay most , if not all , of the plasma membrane 270 and exert forces pushing towards the cell surface . Hence , any endocytic vesicle must either form at spots 271 with no such pre - existing networks or be coupled with local actin depolymerization , to make way for the 272 carrier to move into the cytoplasm . 273 274 Funding 275 E .

Local actin polymerization during Clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 279 a , Early arriving protein FCHo1 / 2 ( Syp1 in yeast ) , Eps15 and Intersectin ( Pan1 and Sla1 ) recruit and activate 280 AP2 and inactivate N - WASP ( Las17 ) , thereby inhibiting actin polymerization . 281 b , N - WASP is recruited and activated by Epsin ( Ent1 ) and other adaptors at the rim of the clathrin coat . The 282 binding of Hip1 / Hip1R ( Sla2 ) to Clathrin light chain and to Cortactin reduce its capacity to bind to F - actin and 283 may trigger local actin depolymerization , facilitating the coat formation . 284 c , Epsin , N - BAR domain proteins Amphiphysin , Endophilin and SNX9 and possibly F - BAR proteins such as 285 Syndapin , mediate Dynamin recruitment and induce neck constriction upon local membrane bending and 286 actin polymerization . 287 d , N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization at the back of Clathrin - mediated vesicle and local actin 288 depolymerization at the front mediate vesicle budding , and movement into the cytosol . 289 290 Figure 2 . Local actin polymerization during Clathrin - independent endocytosis . 291 a , Extracellularly - clustered cargoes ( e . g . CD44 by Galectin - 3 , GM1 by Shiga toxin or GPI - anchored protein 292 clustered into cholesterol - rich nanodomains ) induce the initial inward membrane bending into the cytosol . 293 Local and timely Cdc42 inactivation is mediated by ARHGAP10 recruited by Arf1 to the plasma membrane 294 ( likely at initial stages ) and then by Cdc42 - GAP activity of GRAF1 ( at later stages ) . Local Cdc42 / N - WASP - 295 induced actin polymerization mediate CLIC formation but the precise molecular links to the invaginations are 296 still unknown . 297 b , Fast Endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) requires local PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 production by SHIP2 and the 298 recruitment of Lamellipodin ( Lpd ) and Endophilin . N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization as well 299 as Rac1 / WAVE and PAK1 / 2 activities , are required for local actin assembly but the details are missing so 300 far . N - WASP may be recruited and activated by the SH3 domain of Endophilin . 301 c , IL2R β clustering stimulates WAVE recruitment to WIRS motifs present in the cytoplasmic tails of IL2R β . 302 IL2R β also recruit PI3K to produce locally PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which recruits Rac1 , thereby activating WAVE and 303 PAK1 . N - WASP , Cortactin and Dynamin are then mediating IL2R β endocytic pit closure and detachment 304 from the cell surface . 305 306 Figure 3 . Local actin polymerization during macropinocytosis . 307 Sustained and / or elevated receptor signaling trigger intense local Ras and PI3K signaling , which produce 308 PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and recruit Cdc42 - N - WASP and Rac1 - WAVE complexes as well as PAK1 , thereby promoting 309 actin polymerization - induced membrane ruffling and protrusions . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 activates and recruits PLC , 310 which hydrolyzes PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 into IP 3 and DAG , which in turn activate PKC , thus stimulating further actin 311 polymerization . SHIP1 and 2 dephosphorylate PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 into PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , thereby recruiting SNX9 ( which 312 activates N - WASP ) and Lamellipodin ( Lpd ) , which mediates actin filament elongation through ENA / VASP . 313 314 References 315 1 .
