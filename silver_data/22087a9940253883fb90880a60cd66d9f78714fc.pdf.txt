Zucker , MD , JD 1 Data from randomized clinical trials and real - world obser - vational studies show that all three COVID - 19 vaccines cur - rently authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration * are safe and highly effective for preventing COVID - 19 – related serious illness , hospitalization , and death ( 1 , 2 ) . Studies of vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) for preventing new infections and hospitalizations attributable to SARS - CoV - 2 , the virus that causes COVID - 19 ) , particularly as the B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Delta ) variant has become predominant , are limited in the United States ( 3 ) . In this study , the New York State Department of Health linked statewide immunization , laboratory testing , and hospitalization databases for New York to estimate rates of new laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 cases and hospitalizations by vaccination status among adults , as well as corresponding VE for full vaccina - tion in the population , across all three authorized vaccine prod - ucts . During May 3 – July 25 , 2021 , the overall age - adjusted VE against new COVID - 19 cases for all adults declined from 91 . 7 % to 79 . 8 % . During the same period , the overall age - adjusted VE against hospitalization was relatively stable , ranging from 91 . 9 % to 95 . 3 % . Currently authorized vaccines have high effectiveness against COVID - 19 hospitalization , but effectiveness against new cases appears to have declined in recent months , coinciding with the Delta variant’s increase from < 2 % to > 80 % in the U . S . region that includes New York and relaxation of masking and physical distancing recommendations . To reduce new COVID - 19 cases and hospitalizations , these findings support the implementation of a layered approach centered on vaccination , as well as other prevention strategies such as masking and physical distancing . Four databases ( the Citywide Immunization Registry , New York State Immunization Information System , Electronic Clinical * As of the publication date of this report , COVID - 19 vaccines by Pfizer - BioNTech , Moderna , and Janssen ( Johnson & Johnson ) have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization . Laboratory Reporting System , and Health Electronic Response Data System [ HERDS ] ) were linked to construct a surveillance - based cohort of adults aged ≥18 years residing in New York by using individual name - based identifiers , date of birth , and zip code of residence . The Citywide Immunization Registry and the New York State Immunization Information System are used to collect and store all COVID - 19 provider vaccination data for persons residing in New York City and the rest of the state , respectively ( excluding selected settings such as Veterans Affairs and military health care facilities ) ; persons were considered fully vaccinated ≥14 days after receipt of the final vaccine dose . † The Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System collects all reportable COVID - 19 test results ( nucleic acid amplification test [ NAAT ] or antigen ) in New York ( 4 ) ; a new COVID - 19 case was defined as the receipt of a new positive SARS - CoV - 2 NAAT or antigen test result , but not within 90 days of a previous positive result . HERDS includes a statewide , daily electronic survey of all inpatient facili - ties in New York ; new admissions with a laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 diagnosis are entered into HERDS daily by trained hospital staff members . After a period of phased COVID - 19 vaccine eligibility based on age , occupation , setting , or comorbidities beginning in December 2020 , all New York residents aged ≥60 years were eligible for vaccination by March 10 , 2021 ; eligibility was expanded to persons aged ≥30 years by March 30 , and to all adults aged ≥18 years by April 6 . § To allow time for a large portion of vaccinated persons to achieve full immunity , this study was restricted to the week beginning May 3 through the week beginning July 19 , 2021 . † Final dose was the second dose for Pfizer - BioNTech and Moderna vaccines , first dose for Janssen vaccine . § https : / / www . governor . ny . gov / news / governor - cuomo - announces - new - yorkers - 30 - years - age - and - older - will - be - eligible - receive - covid - 19 Early Release 2 MMWR / August 18 , 2021 / Vol . 70 Breakthrough infections were defined as new cases among persons who were fully vaccinated on the day of specimen collection . Hospitalizations among persons with breakthrough infection were defined as new hospital admissions among persons fully vaccinated on the reporting day . The total adult state population that was fully vaccinated and unvaccinated ¶ was assessed for each day and stratified by age group ( 18 – 49 years , 50 – 64 years , and ≥65 years ) . Persons who were partially vaccinated were excluded from analyses . For each week and age group , the rates of new cases and hospitalizations were calculated among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated persons , by respectively dividing the counts for each group by the fully vaccinated and unvaccinated person - days in that week . Age - adjusted VE each week was estimated as the population - weighted mean of the age - stratified VE . * * The interval between completing vaccination and positive SARS - CoV - 2 test result date was summarized using the median , interquartile range ( IQR ) , and percentage tested ≥7 days from being fully vaccinated . †† The ratio of hospitalizations to cases was ¶ The total adult state population that unvaccinated was calculated as the total U . S . Census population , minus fully or partially vaccinated persons . Persons who were partially vaccinated were defined as those who initiated a vaccine series but did not complete it or were within 14 days after completion . * * For both outcomes , VE at each week and age group was calculated as 1 - ( Rate vaccinated / Rate unvaccinated ) . †† The percentage tested ≥7 days from being fully vaccinated was included to inform possible undiagnosed infection before full vaccination was achieved . computed for each vaccination group to understand the relative severity of cases . Statistical testing was not performed because the study included the whole population of interest and was not a sample . By July 25 , 2021 , a total of 10 , 175 , 425 ( 65 . 8 % ) New York adults aged ≥18 years were fully vaccinated ; 1 , 603 , 939 ( 10 . 4 % ) were partially vaccinated . Among fully vaccinated adults , 51 . 3 % had received Pfizer - BioNTech , 39 . 8 % had received Moderna , and 8 . 9 % had received Janssen ( Johnson & Johnson ) vaccines . During May 3 – July 25 , a total of 9 , 675 new cases ( 1 . 31 per 100 , 000 person - days ) occurred among fully vacci - nated adults , compared with 38 , 505 ( 10 . 69 per 100 , 000 per - son - days ) among unvaccinated adults ( Table ) . Most ( 98 . 1 % ) new cases among fully vaccinated persons occurred ≥7 days after being classified fully vaccinated ( median = 85 days ; IQR = 58 – 113 ) . During May 3 – July 25 , case rates among fully vaccinated persons were generally similar across age groups , as were case rates among unvaccinated persons , declining through the end of June before increasing in July ( Figure 1 ) . Weekly estimated VE against new laboratory - confirmed infection during May 3 – July 25 for all age groups generally declined , ranging from 90 . 6 % to 74 . 6 % for persons aged 18 – 49 years , 93 . 5 % to 83 . 4 % for persons aged 50 – 64 years , and 92 . 3 % to 88 . 9 % for persons aged ≥65 years . During May 3 – July 25 , the overall , age - adjusted VE against infection declined from 91 . 7 % to 79 . 8 % ( Figure 1 ) ( Table ) . TABLE .

Real - world studies of population - level vaccine effectiveness against laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection and COVID - 19 hospitalizations are limited in the United States . What is added by this report ? During May 3 – July 25 , 2021 , the overall age - adjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in New York was relatively stable ( 91 . 9 % – 95 . 3 % ) . The overall age - adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection for all New York adults declined from 91 . 7 % to 79 . 8 % . What are the implications for public health practice ? These findings support the implementation of multicomponent approach to controlling the pandemic , centered on vaccination , as well as other prevention strategies such as masking and physical distancing . Discussion In this study , current COVID - 19 vaccines were highly effec - tive against hospitalization ( VE > 90 % ) for fully vaccinated New York residents , even during a period during which prevalence of the Delta variant increased from < 2 % to > 80 % in the U . S . region that includes New York , societal public health restric - tions eased , § § and adult full - vaccine coverage in New York neared 65 % . However , during the assessed period , rates of new cases increased among both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated adults , with lower relative rates among fully vaccinated persons . Moreover , VE against new infection declined from 91 . 7 % to 79 . 8 % . To reduce new COVID - 19 cases and hospitalizations , these findings support the implementation of a layered approach centered on vaccination , as well as other prevention strategies . The findings from this study are consistent with those observed in other countries . Israel has reported 90 % VE for the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine against hospitalization ; however , a decline in VE against new diagnosed infections occurred dur - ing June 20 – July 17 ( decreasing to < 65 % ) ( 5 ) . Another study in the United Kingdom found higher VE against infection with the Delta variant for Pfizer - BioNTech ( 88 % ) , which was lower than VE against the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha ) variant ( 94 % ) ( 6 ) . The factors driving the apparent changes in VE , including variations by age , are uncertain . Changes in immune protec - tion from current vaccine product dosing regimens are under investigation , ¶¶ with additional doses being considered ( 7 ) . Increased Delta variant viral load might underpin its increased transmissibility and could potentially lead to reduced vaccine - induced protection from infection ( 8 ) . Further , variations from clinical trial findings could be because the trials were conducted § § https : / / covid . cdc . gov / covid - data - tracker / # variant - proportions ¶¶ https : / / www . medrxiv . org / content / 10 . 1101 / 2021 . 07 . 28 . 21261159v1 during a period before the emergence of new variants and when nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies ( e . g . , wearing masks and physically distancing ) were more stringently implemented , potentially lessening the amount of virus to which persons were exposed . Other factors that could influence VE include indi - rect protective effects of unvaccinated persons by vaccinated persons and an increasing proportion of unvaccinated persons acquiring some level of immunity through infection ( 9 ) . The findings in this report are subject to at least six limi - tations . First , although limiting the analysis period to after universal adult vaccine eligibility and age stratification likely helped to reduce biases , residual differences between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated groups have the potential to reduce estimated VE . Second , the analysis excluded partially vaccinated persons , to robustly assess VE for fully vaccinated compared with that of unvaccinated persons . A supplementary sensitivity analysis that included partially vaccinated persons as unvaccinated yielded conservative VE for laboratory - confirmed infection ( declining from 88 . 7 % to 72 . 1 % ) and for hospitaliza - tions ( ranging from 89 . 7 % to 93 . 0 % ) . Third , exact algorithms were used to link databases ; some persons were possibly not linked because matching variables were entered differently in the respective systems . Fourth , this study did not estimate VE by vaccine product , and persons were categorized fully vaccinated at 14 days after final dose , per CDC definitions ; however , the Janssen vaccine might have higher efficacy at 28 days . * * * Given that Janssen vaccine recipients accounted for 9 % of fully vaccinated persons and the observed time period from full vaccination to infection ( median 85 days ) , this would minimally affect the findings . Fifth , information on reasons for testing and hospitalization , including symptoms , was lim - ited . However , a supplementary analysis found that among 1 , 271 fully vaccinated adults and 7 , 308 unvaccinated adults , 545 ( 42 . 9 % ) and 4 , 245 ( 58 . 1 % ) , respectively , were reported to have been admitted for COVID - 19 by hospital staff members using nonstandardized definitions . A sensitivity analysis of hospitalization VE limited to those admitted for COVID - 19 , found similar results ( VE range = 93 . 9 % – 97 . 4 % ) , suggesting that the extent of bias was limited . Finally , data were too sparse to reliably estimate VE for COVID - 19 - related deaths . This study’s findings suggest currently available vaccines have high effectiveness for preventing laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection and COVID - 19 hospitalization . However , VE against infection appears to have declined in recent months in New York , coinciding with a period of eas - ing societal public health restrictions ††† and increasing Delta variant circulation ( 8 ) . These findings support a multipronged * * * https : / / www . fda . gov / media / 146338 / download ††† https : / / coronavirus . jhu . edu / data / state - timeline / new - confirmed - cases / new - york / 205 Early Release 6 MMWR / August 18 , 2021 / Vol . 70 approach to reducing new COVID - 19 hospitalizations and cases , centered on vaccination , and including other approaches such as masking and physical distancing .
