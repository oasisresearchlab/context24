The method is based on interpolation of the reciprocal space Ewald sums and evaluation of the resulting convolutions using fast Fourier transforms . Timings and accuracies are presented for three large crystalline ionic systems . INTRODUCTION We consider a lattice A defined by elementary transla tion vectors al ' a2 ' and a3 with Euclidean lengths al . a2 . and a3 , respectively . The Cartesian components of the kth lattice vector . ak . are denoted ak [ ( 1 = 1 . 2 . 3 ) . The conjugate reciprocal lattice A * is defined by elementary translations at • a ~ • and a ~ • with Euclidean lengths at • a ~ • and a ~ . and Cartesian components a ~ [ ( k . Z = 1 , 2 , 3 ) . These reciprocal translations satisfy at· a { = 8k { ( k . l = 1 . 2 . 3 ) . The unit cell U of the lattice A consists of all points r having fractional coordinates ( fl ' f2 . f3 ) with - ~ < fk , ; d , for k = 1 , 2 , 3 ( wherefk = at· r ) . We define the functions < I > dir ( r ; { 3 ) and < I > rec ( r ; f3 ) . where r is a point in U and { 3 is a positive number . by and where erfc ( x ) is the complementary error function , V = al . a2Xa3 is the volume of the unit cell U , and nand m are given by n = nlal + n2a2 + n3a3 ' and m = mlaT + m2a ~ + m3a ~ , for integers nk and mk ( k = I , 2 , 3 ) . The effect of { 3 on the Ewald pair potential , ' I / J ( r ; { 3 ) , defined by ' I / J ( r ) = < I > dir ( r ; { 3 ) + < I > rec ( r ; { 3 ) , is that of an additive con stant . Hence . for a neutral system . the total electrostatic energy ( and its derivatives ) are invariant to { 3 . The infinite series defining < I > dir and < I > rec are both rap idly convergent . Their rates of convergence are controlled by adjusting the value of { 3 . If { 3 is chosen so that only the minimum image terms in the direct space sum < I > dir ( r ; f3 ) are retained , the total electrostatic energy of a neutral unit cell U , containing N point charges Ql > Q2 , . . . , qN , located at positions rl ' r2 • . . . • rN ' is given byl - 3 1 N N + 2 " L L Qllj < I > rec ( rj - r ; ; { 3 ) + J ( D ) , i = 1 j = 1 J . Chern . Phys . 98 ( 12 ) , 15 June 1993 ( 2 ) where rij is the minimum image distance . De Leeuw et al . I derived the fourth term J ( D ) in Eq . ( 2 ) , which depends quadratically on the dipole moment D of the unit cell , as well as the macroscopic boundary conditions of the crystal and the external dielectric constant . Choosing { 3 as above makes evaluation of the electro static energy an order N 2 computational problem . Adjust ing { 3 to optimize computational effort results in an order N 3 / 2 algorithm . 4 Although conventional Ewald summation is widely used for simulations of small periodic systems . the computational cost becomes prohibitive for large ( N > 10 4 ) macromolecular simulations . Alternative tech niques for improving the evaluation of long range electro static forces include expansion of the Ewald pair potential in cubic polynomials . S table lookup of the pair potential . 6 use of Wigner potentials , 7 multiple time step ( " twin range " ) methods , S particle - mesh techniques , 9 and efficient Taylor and / or multipole expansions . lO - IS The particle - mesh Ewald ( PME ) method presented here involves choosing { 3 sufficiently large that atom pairs for which rij exceeds a specified cutoff ( e . g . , 9 A . . ) are neg ligible in the direct space sum in Eq . ( 2 ) which reduces this term to order N . The reciprocal space sum in Eq . ( 2 ) is then approximated by a multidimensional piecewise interpolation approach inspired by the particle - mesh method of Hockney and Eastwood . 9 The approximate re ciprocal energy and forces are expressed as convolutions and can thus be evaluated quickly using fast Fourier trans forms ( FFTs ) . The resulting algorithm is of order N In ( N ) , is easily programmed , and is shown below to be efficient and accurate for macromolecular systems . METHOD If < I > rec ( r ; { 3 ) is expressed in fractional coordinates { Ii } we have X exp [ 21Ti ( mdl + mz ! 2 + m3f3 ) ] . ( 3 ) Given positive integers K I , K 2 , andK 3 , we compute < I > rec as well as its ( Cartesian ) gradient on the grid of fractional coordinates ( IlK ! , lz / K z , 13 / K 3 ) , for Ik = I , . . . , K k , 10089 This article is copyrighted as indicated in the article .

Given a pair of atoms i and j , with fractional coordinates fik and fh ' k = 1 , 2 , 3 , the in - where the functions ( } p , K are obtained from the barycentric form of the weights used in ( 2p - l ) th order Lagrangian interpolation using the grid of points ( kIK ) , k E z . 16 More specifically , for real argument x , let [ x ] denote the largest integer less than or equal to x , and define the in terger function kp , K ( X ) by kp , K ( X ) = [ Kx ] - p + 1 . Next de fine tPp , K ( x , k ) by for 0 < k < 2p - 1 1 " l ! . o ' ( - 1 ) ' < 1 ' - ' ) ( x - ~ ) = 0 otherwise , ( 5 ) and finally let ( } p , K ( x , k ) = tPp , K [ x - kp , K ( X ) , k - kp , K ( X ) ] . Note that ( } p , K ( x , k ) is nonzero for 2p values of k , and that the sum of ( } p , K ( x , k ) over all k is unity . Since ( } p , K ( kIK , k ) = 1 and ( } p , K ( iIK , k ) = 0 for l = l = k , we see that ( } p , K ( x , k ) are continuous in x . Note also that x is always in the central grid interval , with respect to the weights , so that we avoid the ill - conditioning associated with high or der polynomial interpolation . The approximate gradient is obtained by replacing < P ree in Eq . ( 4 ) by its gradient , ob tained by term - by - term differentiation , at each grid point . Defining Q at the grid points by the expression for the approximate reciprocal sum energy Eree , pU ) at atom i due to the atoms of the unit cell U is terpolation approximation ( order p ) to the reciprocal space pair potential , < l > ree , p , at each point is given in terms of the precomputed array values of < Pree , ( 4 ) ' " ( ~ ! 2 . ~ ) ( ll - kl 12 - k2 13 - k3 ) £ .

Since ( } p , K ( x , k ) is continuous in x , the approximate ener gies and forces will be continuous with respect to particle position , which is not true of the cell multipole meth ods . 1 0 - 15 We can evaluate < Pree * Q using the fast Fourier transform in order KIK2K3 log ( KIK 2K 3 ) steps , whereas evaluation of Q and Eree , pCi ) , i = 1 , . . . , N can be achieved in order ( 2p ) 2 • N steps . Similar results hold for evaluation of the gradient . In practice , we pack < Pree and its three gradi ent components at the grid points into two complex arrays and precompute their Fourier transform ( FT ) once at the start of the simulation . At each subsequent step we com pute Q as a complex array , transform it , multiply the trans formed components by the precomputed complex arrays at each grid point , and then back transform the resulting pair of complex arrays . An upper bound for the absolute error I < I > ree , p - < P ree I can be estimated as follows . Given integers m , and K > 0 , from standard error estimates on Lagrangian interpola tion l6 we have for all x lexp ( 21Timx ) - L exp ( 21Tim ~ ) ( } p ' K ( X ' k ) 1 keZ From Eqs .

The error in the interpolation can be made arbitrarily small by fixing al / KI , a2 / K2 , and a3 / K3 to be less than one , and then choosing p sufficiently large . Thus , the quantity KIK2K3 is of order the system size ala2a3 and hence of order N , for any desired tolerance , and so the proposed algorithm is of order N log ( N ) . RESULTS The PME method was implemented by modifying the AMBER3 . 0 ( Rev . A ) molecular dynamics code in the fol lowing way . The direct space pair potential , cI > dir > was com puted along with the van der Waals and H - bond terms from an atom - based nonbond list . The erfc ( x ) function and its derivative were obtained by table look up ( relative error < 1 . 0x 10 - 8 ) for increased efficiency .

All tests were run as single processor jobs on the Cray YMP at the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center . The accuracy and computational efficiency of the PME method were tested on several macromolecular crystals . Unit cells were constructed from the space groups using the crystallographic coordinates for the heavy atom posi tions , as in previous work . 18 , 19 Point charges were assigned using the AMBER force field . 2o Electrostatic energies and forces for each atom are compared to the corresponding values calculated using the exact Ewald pair potential ( rel ative accuracy < 1 X 10 - 7 ) . Table I shows the results for an ionic B - DNA crys tal . 21 Results are given for grid densities ( al / K 1 xa2 / K2 Xa3 / K3 ) 1 / 3 of approximately 1 . 0 , 0 . 75 , and 0 . 5 A , and interpolation order p = 1 , 2 , , 3 , 4 . The computational cost of the PME method is compared to that of normal evaluation of nonbond interactions using a 9 A atom - based Verlet list on a single processor Cray YMP . The overhead above nor mal nonbond interactions ranges from approximately 16 % to 84 % corresponding to root mean square ( rms ) relative force errors of 2 . 9 X 10 - 2 and 5 . 7 X 10 - 6 , respectively . We conclude that reasonable relative accuracy ( about 2 X 10 - 4 rms force error ) can be obtained with approximately a 40 % overhead , by using triquintic interpolation ( p = 3 ) on a 0 . 75 A grid . Similar accuracies and computational costs are obtained for large protein crystals 22 , 23 using compara ble grid densities and interpolation orders ( Table II ) . Note J . Chern .

Traditional particle - mesh techniques have been criti cized as not being able to attain high accuracy efficiently , especially for nonuniform particle distributions . 11 Our re sults indicate that high precision ( rms relative force error < 1 . 0 X 10 - 5 ) is easily obtained for macromolecular sys tems by using higher order interpolation with only a mod est increase in computational time . Although the PME method has increased memory requirements over conven tional nonbond list - based methods , the cost of memory appears to be rapidly decreasing , and hence may not be an issue in the future . The PME method offers several advantages as a method for the treatment of long - range forces in macro molecular systems . These include ( 1 ) High accuracy : High accuracy ( z 5 X 10 - 6 relative force ) can be obtained with relatively little increase in computational effort . ( 2 ) East o / implementation : The PME method can be efficiently implemented into conventional MD algorithms such as AMBER which use a Verlet list . ( 3 ) Continuity : The PME pair potential and its deriv atives are continuous functions of position , regardless of the accuracy required , and thus avoid problems involved with integration of discontinuous functions . ( 4 ) Efficiency : The PME method is fast . For large macromolecular systems , the PME method requires only about a 40 % overhead over conventional truncated list based methods to obtain relative force accuracies of z2 X 10 - 4• The FORTRAN subroutines for performing the PME approximate energies and forces are available upon request from the authors .
