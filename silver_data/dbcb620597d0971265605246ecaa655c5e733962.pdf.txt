Live cell imaging of endocytosis has helped to decipher many of its mechanisms and regulations . With the pulsed - pH ( ppH ) protocol , one can detect the formation of individual endocytic vesicles ( EVs ) with an unmatched temporal resolution of 2 s . The ppH protocol makes use of cargo protein ( e . g . , the transferrin receptor ) coupled to a pH - sensitive ﬂ uorescent protein , such as superecliptic pHluorin ( SEP ) , which is brightly ﬂ uorescent at pH 7 . 4 but not ﬂ uorescent at pH < 6 . 0 . If the SEP moiety is at the surface , its ﬂ uorescence will decrease when cells are exposed to a low pH ( 5 . 5 ) buffer . If the SEP moiety has been internalized , SEP will remain ﬂ uorescent even during application of the low pH buffer . Fast perfusion enables the complete exchange of low and high pH extracellular solutions every 2 s , de ﬁ ning the temporal resolution of the technique . Unlike other imaging - based endocytosis assays , the ppH protocol detects EVs without a priori hypotheses on the dynamics of vesicle formation . Here , we explain how the ppH protocol quanti ﬁ es the endocytic activity of living cells and the recruitment of associated proteins in real time . We provide a step - by - step procedure for expression of the reporter proteins with transient transfection , live cell image acquisition with synchronized pH changes and automated analysis . The whole protocol can be performed in 2 d to provide quantitative information on the endocytic process being studied . Introduction Development of the ppH protocol Endocytosis , the formation of cytosolic membrane - bound vesicles from the plasma membrane , is an essential feature of eukaryotic cell biology . It has been directly involved in numerous cellular pro - cesses such as nutrient uptake , pathogen entry , signal transduction , regulation of plasma membrane receptors and the formation and function of synapses in neurons and immune cells 1 , 2 . Since the ﬁ rst description of endocytic vesicles containing yolk protein in mosquito oocytes by Roth and Porter 3 , researchers have characterized the endocytosis of a large variety of cargo in many different cell types . An important step in our understanding of endocytosis was the realization that molecularly and structurally distinct types of endocytosis may coexist in a single cell . Besides clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , which was ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed and remains the best - de ﬁ ned endocytic pathway 4 , several clathrin - independent endocytosis pathways have been de ﬁ ned 5 , 6 . One critical aspect of understanding how endocytosis is organized in cells is to determine the location and dynamics of endocytic sites at the cell surface . To this aim , intense research effort has been dedicated to developing methods that can detect endocytosis events with the highest resolution ( reviewed in refs . 4 , 7 , 8 ) . By de ﬁ nition , endocytosis occurs when a cargo ( i . e . , a ligand or receptor initially on the plasma membrane , or more generally membrane or membrane - bound molecules , such as proteins and lipids ) is internalized into the cell via endocytic vesicles . Studying endocytosis bene ﬁ ts from several technical advantages over other ( intra ) cellular membrane traf ﬁ cking events . First , it takes place at the plasma membrane , which is easy to de ﬁ ne and visualize . Second , the extracellular environment is easy to access and manipulate , at least for isolated cells or cell monolayers . To distinguish cargo remaining on the cell surface from internalized cargo , researchers have used various methods including cell 1 University of Bordeaux , Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience , UMR 5297 , Bordeaux , France . 2 CNRS , Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience , UMR 5297 , Bordeaux , France . 3 Present address : CNRS , Institut des Sciences Moléculaires , UMR 5255 , Talence , France . 4 Present address : Euroquality , Bordeaux , France . 5 Present address : Sys2diag , Montpellier , France . 6 Present address : University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , CA , USA . 7 These authors contributed equally : Silvia Sposini , Morgane Rosendale . ✉ e - mail : david . perrais @ u - bordeaux . fr 3088 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | SEPTEMBER 2020 | 3088 – 3104 | www . nature . com / nprot PROTOCOL https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41596 - 020 - 0371 - z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; 1234567890 ( ) : , ; fractionation , transmission electron microscopy or light microscopy 9 , 10 . Observation by electron microscopy is the most precise but may be tedious and is only possible on ﬁ xed cellular samples . Light microscopy thus appears as a method of choice , but , given that endocytic vesicles can have a diameter of ~ 100 nm , which is below the limit of resolution of ﬂ uorescence microscopy , an endocytic vesicle remaining close to the plasma membrane cannot be distinguished from a cluster remaining on the plasma membrane . To overcome this limitation , researchers have developed alternative methods to visually segregate internalized cargo from the cell surface pool . In a typical assay , cells are incubated with a speci ﬁ c receptor ligand , an antibody , amine - reactive biotin , a ﬂ uid phase or a membrane marker for a de ﬁ ned period of time . The endocytic process is then arrested , for example , by putting cells at 4 °C . The marker remaining on the plasma membrane is then speci ﬁ cally removed by ( i ) simple wash - out because it is intrinsically labile ( e . g . , the lipid marker FM1 - 43 11 ) ; ( ii ) application of a strong acid buffer ( pH 3 – 4 ) , which destabilizes most protein - protein interactions ; ( iii ) competition with unlabeled ligand ; or ( iv ) the use of reducing agents that can cleave speci ﬁ cally designed markers 12 . Alternatively , the marker can be left on the plasma membrane and detected after chemical ﬁ xation via a secondary marker ( e . g . , an antibody ) . Finally , the internalized fraction of the endocytic marker can be detected if it is radiolabeled 13 , 14 or ﬂ uorescent itself , or by a secondary marker after membrane permeabilization ( different from the surface secondary marker , if applicable ) . These assays are sensitive and quantitative , but they are usable only for a single time point after the initiation of endocytosis and often require cell ﬁ xation . An alternative strategy compatible with live cell imaging is to tag the cargo of interest with ﬂ uorophores sensitive to their local environment . One such ﬂ uorophore is the ﬂ uorescent protein superecliptic pHluorin ( SEP ) , a mutant of GFP that is brightly ﬂ uorescent at pH 7 . 4 ( i . e . , the extracellular pH ) but not ﬂ uorescent at pH < 6 . 0 15 , 16 . This latter value corresponds to the pH of intracellular organelles such as secretory vesicles , recycling endosomes and synaptic vesicles . Therefore , SEP - tagged membrane proteins localized to these organelles have been widely used to study exocytosis by monitoring the pH change occurring when the cargo is re - exposed to the extracellular environment after exocytosis 15 – 19 . Because of its sensitivity to pH , SEP can also be used to report endocytosis . Effectively , application of extracellular solution with low pH ( 5 . 5 ) monitors the location of a cargo tagged with SEP . If the tag is accessible to the solution exchange ( i . e . , the cargo is still at the surface ) , then SEP ﬂ uorescence will vanish during exposure to low pH buffer . However , if the tag is trapped inside vesicles ( i . e . , the cargo has been internalized ) , then SEP will remain ﬂ uor - escent even during application of a low - pH solution . For example , in cells transfected with the transferrin receptor ( TfR - SEP ) , a receptor that clusters at clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) on the plasma membrane and is constitutively internalized by CME , a subset of clusters resists quenching by the application of low - pH buffer ( Fig . 1a ) . This subset of clusters corresponds to intracellular vesicles with luminal pH > 6 . 5 . By alternating between pH 7 . 4 and pH 5 . 5 every 2 s , newly formed endocytic vesicles are revealed as ﬂ uorescent spots in images taken at pH 5 . 5 corresponding to the pre - existing clusters seen at pH 7 . 4 ( Fig . 1b – d ) . These spots disappear within ~ 20 s regardless of the pH at the surface , as natural acidi ﬁ cation of the luminal pH of vesicles along their maturation occurs soon after endocytosis by vacuolar H + ATPase activity . Using this protocol , the time and location of single endocytic vesicle formation can be precisely determined . We named it the ‘ pulsed pH ’ ( ppH ) protocol ’ 20 . The ppH protocol was originally developed in 2005 20 and has since undergone several develop - ments , including a semi - automated analysis that allows researchers to systematically monitor the recruitment of CME - related proteins to forming clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) 21 – 23 . For example , the maximum recruitment of dynamin , a large GTPase that cuts the vesicle neck and is thus essential for vesicle formation 24 , coincides with the time of scission ( i . e . , 2 – 4 s before CCV detection ; Fig . 1c , d and Fig . 2d ) 21 . More recently , we have developed a supervised machine - learning feature for fully automated analysis 25 . In this article , we describe ( i ) the imaging setup to acquire time lapse movies of cells transfected with SEP - tagged cargo ( TfR ) in synchrony with pH changes , and ( ii ) the automated analysis to extract quantitative data . Applications of the ppH protocol The ppH protocol is based on live cell ﬂ uorescence imaging . We mainly use total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , but various imaging modalities including simple wide - ﬁ eld epi - ﬂ uorescence 20 and highly inclined and laminated optical sheet ( HiLo ) microscopy have been tested 26 . Others such as spinning disk and classical confocal microscopy could be employed as well 27 . NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | SEPTEMBER 2020 | 3088 – 3104 | www . nature . com / nprot 3089 By predominantly illuminating the ﬁ rst ~ 100 nm of the surface of cultured cells adhering to the glass coverslip , TIRF microscopy is indeed particularly suited to observe endocytosis 28 , fusion pore dynamics 19 , early steps of endosome maturation and phago - and pino - cytosis . Typically , cells are transfected with membrane protein cargo tagged with SEP . Over the years , we have tested various mammalian cell lines ( NIH 3T3 , HeLa , COS7 , BSC1 and HEK293 ) as well as primary cells in culture ( neurons and astrocytes ) 19 , 26 , 29 . Moreover , we have developed the pH - sensitive red ﬂ uorescent protein pHuji 30 for simultaneous imaging of the endocytosis of two cargo proteins ( one labelled with SEP , the other with pHuji ) into individual CCVs 30 , 31 . Another promising marker is the red pH - sensitive organic ﬂ uorophore Virginia Orange , which can label speci ﬁ c protein domains such as SNAPtag or antibodies 32 ( Table 1 ) . Other pH - sensitive dyes , like cypHer 33 or pHrodo Red dextran 34 , do not have suf ﬁ cient dynamic range to be used for the ppH assay . The cargo that we have studied the most is TfR , which is exclusively and constitutively internalized at high rates through CME , but the endocytosis of other membrane proteins has been reported : β 2 adrenergic receptors 29 , 30 , GluA1 and GluA2 α - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid ( AMPA ) - type glutamate receptors 29 , 35 , µ opioid receptor 26 , 31 and glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored cargo 36 . One dif ﬁ culty is that for some receptors , such as AMPA receptors 29 , 37 , a signi ﬁ cant fraction is located in intracellular but only mildly acidic organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum . These receptors thus resist the extracellular pH changes and may obscure the detection of endocytic vesicles . To solve this issue , we performed photobleaching while perfusing a low - pH solution before ima - ging 29 , 35 . At this pH , surface receptors are not ﬂ uorescent , hence protected from the photobleaching . ‘ Background ﬂ uorescence ’ having been thus bleached , a clear detection of endocytic events becomes possible during imaging . Cells can be imaged with TIRF microscopy and the ppH protocol at a frequency of 0 . 5 Hz for ≥ 40 min 22 , 25 , 29 . Within this time window , the frequency of recorded endocytic events is constant . Therefore , it is possible to measure the effect of treatments stimulating or inhibiting endocytosis on single cells in a quantitative way . We have veri ﬁ ed the innocuousness of the ppH protocol on endocytosis in a number of ways . First , the frequency of recorded events is constant in all cell types tested ( see above ) . Second , cells are able to internalize the ligand transferrin to the same extent as cells that do not experience the pH changes 20 , 29 . Third , the cytoplasm of cells acidi ﬁ es only minimally ( 0 . 2 pH units after 15 min ) during the ppH 20 .

In neurons , application of a low - pH solution activates acid - sensing ion channels , but these channels can be blocked without in ﬂ uencing the frequency of recorded endocytic events 29 . Alternatively , a low - pH solution can be replaced by a green ﬂ uorescence quencher ( e . g . , trypan purple ) , which allowed us to record a similar number of events as with the original ppH protocol 29 . However , trypan purple slowly accumulates at the surface of cells such that it cannot be used for > 5 min to assess endocytosis activity quantitatively . Until now , we have used the ppH protocol on cells overexpressing cargo proteins tagged with ﬂ uorescent pH - sensitive proteins , through transient transfection of either cell lines or primary neuronal cultures . The constant progress in genome - editing techniques makes the production of genome - edited cell lines with these tagged receptors very likely very soon . This could lead to high - throughput , quantitative assays of endocytosis in living cells , which will be amenable for molecular screens . Moreover , the ppH protocol is compatible with patch clamp 25 , and we are currently also combining the protocol with super - resolution microscopy such as single - particle tracking photo - activation localization microscopy . The high spatial and temporal precision in localizing newborn endocytic vesicles will make the ppH protocol a very powerful technique to explore the dynamics of endocytosis at nanoscopic scales . Comparison with other methods In a recent review article 8 , we described the four main families of methods to detect the formation of endocytic vesicles , the last one being the ppH protocol and its variants . All four families of methods have their own advantages and limitations . In the ﬁ rst family , methods were designed to distinguish cargo left on the plasma membrane from internalized cargo , either by transmission electron microscopy or by sequential labeling and permeabilization . However , this requires ﬁ xation of the biological sample and is thus not compatible with live cell imaging , which led to the development of the other three families of methods . The second family is based on the monitoring of endosomal acidi ﬁ cation after cargo inter - nalization . Like the ppH , it uses a pH - sensitive tag , most often SEP , and follows the overall cellular decrease in ﬂ uorescence as endosomes acidify . This method has been very useful for monitoring the internalization of synaptic vesicles in neurons where endocytosis is synchronized with exocytosis 39 . However , confounding factors , such as the acidi ﬁ cation of the endoplasmic reticulum after treatments that induce receptor endocytosis , can complicate the interpretation of these measures . Moreover , since this method monitors ﬂ uorescence at the cellular scale rather than the single vesicle scale , if endocytosis is not triggered by a stimulus ( by exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons , or ligand application for some receptors ) , then it cannot be monitored by this method . In addition , it reports on acidi ﬁ cation , a process that can be decoupled from endocytosis per se . The third family of methods measures the turnover of endocytic sites . It has been vastly regarded by the scienti ﬁ c community as the method of choice for studying CME with live cell imaging 4 , 7 , 27 . In this case , clathrin itself or associated proteins are speci ﬁ c markers of endocytic sites ( i . e . , clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) such as ﬂ at , curved or closed clathrin lattices ) at the plasma membrane and report on the various steps of vesicle formation : ( i ) appearance of CCS and growth , which corre - sponds to the initial assembly of a cluster ; ( ii ) stable CCS ﬂ uorescence , which corresponds to its maturation ; and ( iii ) disappearance , which corresponds to ﬁ nal invagination , scission , movement of the endocytic vesicle and clathrin uncoating 20 , 21 , 40 , 41 . However , it should be noted that the temporal precision of this assay with regard to membrane scission is limited . We showed with the ppH assay that the time of CCS disappearance gives an inaccurate and imprecise estimate of membrane scission , with a temporal uncertainty comparable to the time course of CCS invagination and CCV formation : scission occurs 7 ± 22 s before CCS ﬂ uorescence decreases by 50 % ( mean ± s . d . ; 107 events in six NIH 3T3 cells 21 ) . Moreover , it relies on a number of assumptions on how an endocytic zone should behave ( e . g . , CCSs should completely disappear after a CCV is formed ) . Most importantly , this type of approach cannot be used for other endocytic pathways independent of clathrin 42 – 45 , where clear markers of endocytic sites are lacking . Finally , the fourth family comprises the ppH protocol and its variations . It is based on the simplest operational de ﬁ nition of endocytosis : the transition of a cargo from the plasma membrane to an intracellular vesicle . Thus , it does not rely on any strong assumption like the second and third families of methods . Moreover , its temporal resolution is unparalleled : the moment of scission is de ﬁ ned by the frame rate at which imaging is performed and is limited only by the exchange of solution . We typically use 2 s , which is much lower than the process of cargo recruitment and internalization through CME , therefore providing suf ﬁ cient sampling 21 . Finally , because the endocytic vesicle is PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS 3092 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | SEPTEMBER 2020 | 3088 – 3104 | www . nature . com / nprot detected within 2 s of its birth , its location can be determined with very high precision , potentially beyond the limit of diffraction of light microscopy . This is of invaluable help in de ﬁ ning hot spots of endocytosis , such as the side of pre - 46 , 47 and post - synaptic structures 29 , 48 or cell adhesion sites 49 . Limitations The main limitation of the ppH protocol is the need for a fast perfusion system . We describe here the use of a local perfusion pipette mounted on a micromanipulator , a setup that may not be suited for all microscopy setups . Alternatively , micro ﬂ uidic channels , which can achieve comparable exchange rates as the one we have set up 50 , 51 , could be a good alternative . In addition , we show that the exchange rate depends on the accessibility of the plasma membrane of the imaged cell ( Fig . 3 ) . In systems in which access to the extracellular space is dif ﬁ cult , such as the basolateral side of epithelia or slices of tissue , fast exchange will not be possible . It should also be noted that because the cell is bathed in a low - pH solution half of the time , only the vesicles formed during perfusion at pH 7 . 4 will be detected . The ones formed during perfusion at pH 5 . 5 , thus already acidic , will remain non - ﬂ uorescent . Consistent with this prediction , CCS disappearance events , another signature of CCV formation ( as explained in Comparison with other methods ) , are associated with a TfR - SEP vesicle isolated at pH 5 . 5 54 % of the time ( 107 / 197 events ) 21 . This is also seen as the occasional recruitment of endocytic proteins such as dynamin1 - mCherry to CCS without the appearance of a vesicle ( Fig . 1c ) . Nevertheless , this datum indicates that the application of a low - pH solution does not affect scission . Consequently , the high number of detections makes it possible to study the endocytic process with high temporal and spatial precision as well as with high statistical power . The effect of the application of a low - pH solution on endocytosis or other cellular processes could be another limitation of the ppH protocol . We have performed at least ﬁ ve control experiments ( see Applications of the ppH protocol ) to demonstrate the lack of effect of the ppH protocol on 7 . 4 7 . 4 5 . 5 Cell 7 . 4 5 . 5 90° Cell Perfusion tip Coverslip pH 5 . 5 pH 7 . 4 a b c d 1 7 6 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 – 4 – 2 0 2 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) pH pH 5 . 5 Scission Detection Image acquisition 0 N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e Valve command Valve command Fig . 3 | Exchange of solutions underneath the cell monitored with ﬂ uorescence imaging . a , Optimal positioning of the application pipette for fast solution exchange .

Note that the drop in ﬂ uorescence ( 7 . 4 → 5 . 5 ) is faster than the increase ( 5 . 5 → 7 . 4 ) , presumably because SEP ﬂ uorescence varies more around its pK a .

Image acquisition ( 100 – 200 - ms exposure ) is performed at the end of the application of a given pH .

However , speci ﬁ c endocytic pathways could be affected , calling for the need for control experiments in particular systems . For example , activation of N - methyl - D - aspartate – type glutamate receptors , which in neurons stimulates the internalization of AMPA - type glutamate receptors , is blocked at pH 5 . 5 . However , this block is fully reversible upon application of solution at pH 7 . 4 , and stimulation of internalization is observed during the ppH protocol 29 . Finally , if a low - pH solution impairs endocytosis of the cargo under investigation , extracellular quenchers such as trypan purple can be employed instead of a low - pH solution 29 . Experimental design The ppH protocol is designed for adherent cells in culture . Fast exchange of the extracellular medium is best achieved with a two - channel application pipette mounted on a micromanipulator . Therefore , the coverslip with adherent cells is mounted in an open chamber with heated bath perfusion to perform experiments at physiological temperature . The pipette is positioned such that the cell is bathed in either pH 7 . 4 or pH 5 . 5 buffer ( Fig . 3a ) . With optimal positioning , fast and reversible exchange of solutions is achieved ( see Extended Data Fig . 2 for troubleshooting ) . We monitored the exchange of solution with HeLa cells transfected with TfR - SEP with continuous TIRF imaging at 10 Hz ( Fig . 3b – d ) . The very large surface of this cell type adhering to the coverslip reveals the time needed to exchange solution underneath the cell . Indeed , the middle of the cell requires more time to exchange , ~ 1 s , than its edges ( Fig . 3b , c ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) . In all six cells tested , the exchange of solution was complete in all parts well before the end of the 2 - s application , making this time interval a conservative estimate of exchange for time - lapse recording .

Equipment setup Application pipette 1 Pull one theta glass capillary to a minimal section size of ~ 400 µm in one step . Let the glass cool down . Indent the side of the glass at its narrowest with a diamond knife . The capillary will break by gravity under the weight of the puller , creating two pipettes . Check the tip of the glass pipette with the benchtop microscope . A clean ﬂ at break will ensure the fastest exchange between the two solutions ( Fig . 3a ) . If not satisfactory , pull other theta glass capillaries . 2 Cut pieces of MicroFill tubes of ~ 3 cm long . Insert one in each channel at the back of the theta pipette for ~ 1 cm . 3 Prepare epoxy resin by mixing the two components . ! CAUTION Epoxy resin is harmful in contact with skin or if inhaled . Use appropriate protection . 4 Use a drop of resin to ﬁ x the MicroFill tubes to the back of the pipette . Make sure that the resin seals the back without clogging the channels . Let it dry and harden . Application pipettes can be prepared months in advance . If well maintained ( thoroughly rinsed with water after each experimental session ) , not broken or clogged , one pipette can be used for several months . Perfusion Assemble a perfusion line per solution ( HBS and MBS ) composed of a syringe , a ﬁ lter ( 5 - µm pore size ) , a stopcock , a connector for 0 . 8 - mm i . d . tubing and tube to connect to the three - way electro - valves . If the experiment involves application of a compound , add two additional lines with the compound dissolved in HBS and MBS , respectively . We recommend keeping the tubing diameters and length identical between lines to ensure optimal transitions between control and treatment . We recommend having a separate set of tubes for each compound to avoid cross - contamination . Put an application pipette on the pipette holder , and connect it with tubing to the electrovalves . The application pipette can stay on the holder between experiments . PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS 3096 NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | SEPTEMBER 2020 | 3088 – 3104 | www . nature . com / nprot Procedure Plating and transfection of cells ● Timing 2 d , 1 h hands - on time c CRITICAL This protocol describes the live imaging of TfR - SEP endocytosis in NIH 3T3 cells . Adapt the protocol to other cell types or reporter proteins if necessary . 1 Maintain cell lines in a T25 ﬂ ask with appropriate culture medium in a humidi ﬁ ed incubator at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 ( vol / vol ) . To passage , pre - warm PBS , trypsin and culture medium to 37 °C . Remove the culture medium , rinse the T25 ﬂ ask with 5 ml of PBS , add 0 . 5 ml of trypsin and incubate the cells at 37 °C until the cells have detached ( typically 1 – 5 min ) . After the cells have detached , add 8 ml of full medium and resuspend the cells thoroughly to obtain a single - cell suspension . Split the cells two times a week at a 1 : 20 ratio . 2 For transfection , seed the cells 1 d before in a T25 ﬂ ask . Transfect the cells at 50 – 60 % con ﬂ uence with 1 . 5 µg of TfR - SEP plasmid DNA using 6 µl of Fugene 6 following the manufacturer ’ s protocol . If co - transfection with mCherry - tagged protein , decrease the amount to 1 µg of TfR - SEP plasmid and add 0 . 5 µg of the mCherry plasmid . c CRITICAL STEP It is critical to achieve a high transfection ef ﬁ ciency without inducing cell toxicity or too high overexpression . Adjust the amount of DNA and Fugene 6 when necessary . Other transfection reagents such as lipofectamine 2000 or JetPrime , as well as electroporation ( e . g . , with Lonza Nucleofector T ) , might also be used according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . 3 6 – 24 h after transfection , harvest the cells as in Step 1 and seed them on glass coverslips ( 18 mm round # 1 borosilicate ) in 12 - well plates . It is important that cells are seeded at low density ( 10 – 20 % con ﬂ uence ) to allow imaging of individual cells the following day . Preparation of the imaging setup ● Timing 1 h , 30 min hands - on time 4 Warm up HBS and MBS solutions to 37 °C . 5 Prime the perfusion lines with the pre - warmed solutions by pushing with the syringe plunger up and down until no bubbles remain in the perfusion lines . c CRITICAL STEP Do not prime the perfusion tubes with cold solutions , because gas bubbles will form as solutions reach room temperature , preventing optimal ﬂ ow . c CRITICAL STEP Priming usually consumes 5 – 10 ml of solution . If using expensive reagents , prime the perfusion lines with HBS / MBS only and re ﬁ ll with the reagent - containing solutions . 6 Connect the perfusion lines to inputs of the three - way electrovalves . If using two sets of perfusion lines , connect the two HBS lines to the two inputs of the same three - way electrovalve and the two MBS lines to the two inputs of the other electrovalve . Therefore , during the exchange of solution , the pH of the solution will remain constant ( pH 7 . 4 for HBS and 5 . 5 for MBS ) . Re ﬁ ll the syringes when necessary . Make sure that the level of solution is the same for all lines . In general , verify that the ﬂ ow of solution ( measured as the frequency of drops ) is the same for all lines . Typically , we get a ﬂ ow of 5 – 6 ml / h per line , for a total of 10 – 12 ml / h , or ~ 3 µl / s . 7 Connect the output tubes to the application pipette , and ﬁ nish priming the application system . Make sure that no bubbles remain , and rinse thoroughly with control solutions . 8 Turn on the laser line ( s ) ( 473 nm for SEP / GFP and 561 for mCherry / dsRed ) , the microscope system and camera ( s ) ( QuantEM Model 512SC Imaging Camera , Princeton ) . 9 Start the imaging software ( e . g . , Metamorph ) . 10 Turn on the chamber heating system ( e . g . , Warner Instruments QE - 1 heated platform ) , and let it equilibrate to 37 °C for ~ 10 min . 11 Mount a dry coverslip in the recording chamber , and put it on the microscope stage with a drop of immersion oil on the objective . 12 Put a drop ( 1 – 2 µl ) of solution containing ﬂ uorescent beads ( either FluoSpheres for single - color imaging or TetraSpeck for multicolor imaging ) . Verify the centering of the illumination . In a correctly aligned system for TIRF illumination , the beads should appear brightly ﬂ uorescent when immobilized on the coverslip or blinking as they transiently come close to the coverslip and enter the evanescent ﬁ eld ( Supplementary Movie 2 ) . If beads are in pure water , very few beads will adhere to the coverslip . c CRITICAL STEP Proceed quickly , as the drop of solution may dry , causing the formation of bead aggregates . ? TROUBLESHOOTING NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | SEPTEMBER 2020 | 3088 – 3104 | www . nature . com / nprot 3097 13 Add an equal volume of ionic solution ( e . g . , HBS ) to the drop of bead solution . This will cause the adherence of many beads to the coverslip . Take an image of these beads . For multicolor imaging , take an image with all ﬁ lter sets corresponding to the imaged colors . We perform simultaneous dual - color imaging with either one camera and a Dual - View beam splitter ( BioVision ) or two cameras with a TwinCam adaptor ( Cairn Research ) . These devices need to be aligned , but it is very hard to reach sub - pixel alignment over the whole image . This image in both channels will thus be used before image analysis to calculate a space transform to correct one channel relative to the other ( see Step 29 for a description of the procedure ) . 14 Turn on the bath perfusion pump ( e . g . , peristaltic pump ) and heating ( e . g . , Warner Instruments , cat . no . SF - 28 ) . We typically use a ﬂ ow of 2 ml / min , which is ~ 10 times higher than the ﬂ ow of solution coming from the application pipette ( see Step 6 ) . Therefore , the possible mixing of solution far away from the application pipette should lead to only a very slight acidi ﬁ cation of the medium . 15 Rinse the bath perfusion with distilled water , and prime with HBS . The coverslip used to image the beads can be left on the microscope stage while priming the chamber perfusion system . Excess solution is removed with a vacuum pump . 16 Stop the bath perfusion pump , and remove the coverslip . The setup is now ready for imaging . Cell imaging ● Timing < 1 h 17 With the help of tweezers , take a coverslip from the 12 - well plate ( from Step 3 ) in the incubator , and place it in a 3 - cm Petri dish with warm HBS . 18 Gently wipe the coverslip underneath with tissue paper , and mount it in the imaging chamber . Add warm HBS , and place the chamber on the heated platform on the microscope stage . 19 Focus on the coverslip . Start the focus control system ( e . g . , ZDC on Olympus microscopes ) . Select a transfected cell for imaging . In the cell lines we have studied , TfR - SEP normally has a punctuate staining with faint diffuse staining outside of puncta ( Figs . 1a and 3b ) . If the expression is too high , the staining is bright and homogenous . If the expression is too low , CCSs can be observed with no diffuse ﬂ uorescence at the membrane , but CCVs will be hard to detect . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 20 Move the application pipette tip to the center of the ﬁ eld of view using the micromanipulator . Because high NA objectives for high - resolution TIRF imaging have a short working distance ( < 150 µm ) , initial positioning above the cell is easier with a Bertrand lens located before the eyepieces . Then , remove the lens , and place the pipette for optimal positioning ( Fig . 3a ) . With a 100× or 150× objective , this optimal positioning is achieved when the tip of the application pipette is placed slightly out of the ﬁ eld of view , ~ 200 µm away from the cell in all three axes . This positioning requires trial and error to be identi ﬁ ed ( with the help of Step 22 ; Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . 21 Open the stopcocks . 22 Start a time - lapse recording . We typically use 100 - ms exposure time every 2 s . Depending on the experiment , the recording lasts from 5 to 40 min ( 150 – 1 , 200 frames ) . pH changes are synchronized with image acquisition ( Fig . 3d ) such that odd frames are taken at pH 7 . 4 and even frames at pH 5 . 5 . Examine the ﬁ rst frames of the recording : there should be a clear difference in ﬂ uorescence at the two different pH values ( Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . In cells expressing TfR - SEP , the overall ﬂ uorescence at pH 7 . 4 is much higher than that at pH 5 . 5 . The ﬂ uorescence at pH 7 . 4 should be the same as with no application ( i . e . , complete exchange between the solutions ) . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 23 Record several cells on the same coverslip in succession . We advise keeping one coverslip in HBS under the microscope for < 1 h in total . Moreover , if reagents such as blockers or agonists are applied , only one cell per coverslip should be recorded . 24 At the end of the imaging session , rinse the setup and all perfusion lines thoroughly with water , and blow dry using plungers . Image analysis ● Timing 15 min per cell for automated analysis c CRITICAL We provide an example of a fully analyzed dataset consisting of an NIH 3T3 cell co - transfected with TfR - SEP and dynamin1 - mCherry and imaged with simultaneous two - color TIRF at 0 . 5 Hz using the ppH protocol for 6 min ( 180 frames ) . The data analysis process is illustrated in Fig . 4 . ( event detection ) and Fig . 2 ( quanti ﬁ cation ) . We describe here the main steps for analysis and troubleshooting .

For the signal / noise ratio , the average ﬂ uorescence in a circle of 2 - pixel radius centered on the center of mass of the segmented object is plotted for each frame before and at the start of segmentation ( time 0 ) . The noise is estimated as the mean ± s . d . before detection ( black line , mean ; gray shading , s . d . ) . Fluo , ﬂ uorescence .

Image size : 1 . 5 × 1 . 5 µ m . For the pre - existing cluster at pH 7 . 4 , in segmented images , the location of the event ( green ) is compared to the clusters of TfR visible at pH 7 . 4 ( red ) for the ﬁ ve frames preceding the event . The fraction of green pixels overlapping with red ( appearing in yellow ) gives an estimate of the colocalization of the candidate vesicle with a parent cluster . An event is quali ﬁ ed as a candidate when this fraction is > 0 . 2 . For the displayed example ( event 1 . in panel d ) , the fraction overlap is 0 . 79 .

In cell lines expressing TfR - SEP , several scission events are detected every frame ( see Fig . 2c ) . We routinely use perfusion buffers with 20 , 21 or without 25 , 30 serum , and we did not ﬁ nd any signi ﬁ cant difference in the internalization of TfR - SEP . Nevertheless , the internalization of other cargo or clathrin - independent endocytosis pathways could be affected by the presence of serum ; thus , care should be taken in choosing the imaging buffer . Thanks to the high temporal resolution of the ppH protocol , fast changes in endocytic activity can be observed , such as ligand - induced internalization of β 2 adrenergic receptor 30 , 31 or the block of endocytosis by guanosine - 5 ′ - ( γ - thio ) - triphosphate ( GTP γ S ) or peptides dialyzed into a cell by a patch - clamp pipette 25 . Moreover , the high number of events detected in a few minutes of recording and with automated analysis by the scission _ analysis suite makes it possible to quickly assess the recruitment of proteins associated with the formation of endocytic vesicles , as shown for dynamin1 in a single cell ( Fig . 2 ) and for ~ 40 proteins involved in CME with ﬁ ve to seven cells per protein tested 21 , 23 . Table 2 | Troubleshooting table Step Problem Possible reason Solution 12 The Illumination is not centered The TIRF Illuminator is not properly aligned Align the TIRF illuminator using the manufacturer ’ s procedure 19 No transfected cell can be found The transfection ef ﬁ ciency is too low Use a different transfection protocol / reagent that is suitable for the cell line of interest The TIRF illumination is not properly aligned Realign the illumination using ﬂ uorescent beads There is a bubble in the objective immersion oil Remove the coverslip . Wipe off oil from the coverslip and objective . Add a fresh drop of oil , and put the chamber back onto the objective The MBS perfusion is open ; the bath at pH 5 . 5 quenches cellular ﬂ uorescence Close the MBS perfusion line 22 No good exchange of solution ( partial change or no change at all ) The tip of the pipette is not placed properly Move the tip of the pipette for optimal application There is a bubble in one of the lines , especially in the application pipette Lift the application pipette ( to avoid blowing away the cell ) and push in one ( all ) line ( s ) with the syringe plunger ( s ) to remove bubbles One of the lines is clogged at the pipette tip Examine the tip of the application pipette under the microscope . If the tip is clogged , try removing it by aspiration . If not successful , change application pipette The ﬂ ow of the solution is too low Increase the ﬂ ow of the solution by raising the syringes The cells react to the ﬂ ow of the solution , e . g . , by extending ﬁ lopodia towards the ﬂ ow The ﬂ ow of the solution is too strong Reduce the ﬂ ow of the solution by lowering the syringes 29 No scission event is detected The level of expression is too low Record cells with higher expression levels The level of ﬂ uorescence at pH 5 . 5 is very high Try to record cells with lower expression levels . Alternatively , photobleach at pH 5 . 5 to lower the background for detecting endocytic vesicles NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL 15 | SEPTEMBER 2020 | 3088 – 3104 | www . nature . com / nprot 3101 Reporting Summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article .
