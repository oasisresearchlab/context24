The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation among in - testinal permeability , tryptase activity and mucosal mast cell count . Methods Rectal biopsies from 16 patients with diarrhea - predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS - D ) and 7 normal subjects were as - sessed for tryptase activity and macromolecular permeability using horseradish peroxidase in Ussing chambers . In addition , mu - cosal mast cell levels were immunohistochemically quantified via image analysis . Results Rectal biopsy of tissues from IBS - D patients showed significantly increased permeability compared with those from normal con - trols ( 0 . 644 ± 0 . 08 and 0 . 06 ± 0 . 00 ng / 2 hr / mm 2 , P ＜ 0 . 01 ) . Tryptase activity was also substantially higher in rectal biopsy samples from IBS - D patients than those from normal controls ( 0 . 86 ± 0 . 18 and 0 . 28 ± 0 . 04 mU / mg protein , P ＜ 0 . 05 ) . Mucosal mast cell counts were not significantly different between the 2 groups ( P ＞ 0 . 05 ) . However , correlation analysis re - vealed that only mucosal mast cell count was significantly correlated with intestinal permeability in IBS - D patients ( r = 0 . 558 , P ＜ 0 . 05 ) . Conclusions This study demonstrated a positive correlation between the number of mucosal mast cells and intestinal permeability , suggest - ing that mucosal mast cells play an important role for increased intestinal permeability in patients with IBS - D .

Symptoms of post - infectious IBS are associated with a subtle increase in intestinal permeability . 1 Patients with di - arrhea predominant IBS ( IBS - D ) have been shown to have in - creased small intestinal permeability compared to post - infectious IBS patients and controls . 2 These findings suggest that an abnor - mal intestinal barrier facilitates enhanced antigen exposure that may activate the intestinal immune system and induce IBS symp - toms such as abdominal pain . Although the mechanism for increased intestinal perme - ability in IBS is still unclear , mast cells seem to play an important role . Recent studies have demonstrated that chronic stress in - creased the number and activity of mucosal mast cells and in - duced mass cell - mediated alterations in epithelial function . 3 - 5 Furthermore , increased numbers of CD3 , CD25 lymphocytes and mast cells have been detected in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients . 6 - 8 Finally , it has been shown that IBS - D patients have increased rectal permeability responsive to mast cell tryptase . 9 In our previous study , 9 we demonstrated that mucosal mast cell tryptase plays an important role in the increased rectal perme - ability in IBS . However , the relationship between mucosal mast cells and intestinal permeability remains unclear . Therefore , the goal of the present study is to evaluate the correlation among in - testinal permeability , tryptase activity and mucosal mast cell count . Materials and Methods Subjects Biopsy specimens of the rectum were obtained during routine colonoscopies of 16 patients with IBS - D and 7 healthy controls at the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital . All the IBS - D patients ex - hibited symptoms that fulfilled the Rome - II criteria . Participants in the control group had macroscopically and histologically nor - mal colonic mucosa , no persistent bowel symptoms , no organic or functional bowel disease , and no history of chronic medical disease . None of the IBS - D patients had known histories of ab - dominal surgery , inflammatory bowel disease , or post - infectious IBS . Informed written consent was provided by all patients , and this study was approved by the hospital’s local ethics committee . Biopsy forceps with an opening diameter of 6 mm ( FB - 25K - 1 ; Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) were used for the procedures . In most cases , 2 biopsies were taken from the rectum of IBS - D patients and controls . Staining and Quantification of Mucosal Mast Cells Staining for mucosal mast cells Rectal mucosal mast cells were stained using a monoclonal antibody against the human mast cell protease tryptase . Biopsy specimens were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours . For the immunohistochemistry , paraffin - embedded speci - mens were cut with a microtome at 4 μ m thickness . Just before staining , slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohol solutions . After dewaxing , tissue sections were in - cubated with 0 . 5 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol at 22°C for 10 minutes and then washed with running tap water for 15 minutes . Sections were treated with 0 . 1 % trypsin ( Sigma , Poole , UK ) mixed in 0 . 1 % calcium chloride ( pH 7 . 8 ) for 10 minutes at 37°C . Nonspecific binding of protein was blocked by incubation in nor - mal rabbit serum diluted 1 : 5 in Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ; pH 7 . 6 ) for 15 minutes . The slides were then incubated for 18 hours at 4°C with the monoclonal antibody AA1 ( anti - human mast cell protease tryp - tase ; DAKO M7052 , Dako Ltd . , Cambridge , UK ) , washed in TBS for 7 minutes , and reincubated for 30 minutes with bio - tinylated rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) . After the slides were washed again in TBS for 7 minutes , finally they were incubated with streptavidin - biotin complex con - jugated with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ; DAKO k0377 ; Dako ) for 30 minutes . The slides were developed in diaminobenzidine - hydrogen peroxide substrate ( Sigma ) for 10 minutes , and washed under running tap water for 5 minutes . Sections were then counter - stained with hematoxylin followed by dehydration and clearance . And then they were mounted in DPX mountant ( BDH Prolabo ; VWR International Ltd . , Leicestershire , UK ) . Quantification of mucosal mast cells Mucosal mast cells were counted under light microscopy at ×400 magnification by an expert pathologist . Immunohisto - chemically positive - stained mast cells were counted in five con - secutive non - overlapping microscopic fields ( 3 sections × 2 bi - opsy samples ) with areas of 0 . 24 mm 2 . The pathologist did not know histological section’s group of origin . Hyuk Lee , et al 246 Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility Figure 1 . Comparison of intestinal permeability , tryptase activity and mucosal mast cell count between IBS - D patients ( n = 16 ) and controls ( n = 7 ) . Intestinal permeability ( A ) and tryptase activity ( B ) of rectal biopsy tissues from IBS - D patients were significantly increased compared with biopsy tissues from normal controls . ( C ) However , mucosal mast cell counts were not significantly different between the 2 groups . Measurement of Intestinal Permeability The biopsy tissues were mounted in modified Ussing chambers . After mounting , each half chamber was filled with 2 mL Krebs - Ringer bicarbonate ( KRB ) solution , bathing both the mucosal and serosal sides of the specimen . Both sides were gassed with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 and the temperature was kept at 37°C by heat block . After a 30 - minute equilibration period , the KRB in the chamber of mucosal side was replaced with KRB containing HRP at a final concentration of 0 . 4 mg / mL , and the KRB on the serosal side was substituted for fresh KRB . A 0 . 3 mL sample was collected and replaced with 0 . 3 mL KRB on the serosal side every 30 minutes , for a total of 120 minutes . Samples from the serosal chamber were analyzed enzymatically using a modified Wor - thington method with o - dianisidine dihydrochloride ( OPD ; Sigma Chemical Co . , St Louis , MO , USA ) as the substrate . Samples of 50 μ L were relocated to microtitre plates . Then , 100 μ L of OPD Working Solution ( Stable Peroxide Buffer diluted 1 : 10 in OPD solution ) was transferred to each well , and the plate was incubated in a shaker at 300 rpm at room temperature . After 30 minutes , 100 μ L of 2 . 5 M sulfuric acid was applied , and 10 minutes later , the absorbance of the discolorized reaction product was estimated at a wavelength of 490 nm using a microplate read - er ( Model 680 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories , Inc . , Hercules , USA ) . All samples were run in duplicate and measured in reference to a standard curve . HRP flux was demonstrated as ng / 2 hr / mm 2 during steady - state permeation in 30 minutes interval . Tryptase Activity Ten microliter of the supernatant from a tissue extract were applied to 200 μ L of buffer ( 50 mmol / L Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 ; 120 mmol / L NaCl ; 20 g / L heparin ) containing 0 . 5 mmol / L mast cell tryptase substrate ( tosyl - glycine - proline - arginine - p - nitroanilide ) and then they were incubated at room temperature for 17 hours . Substrate cleavage was measured using a microplate reader at an absorbance of 415 nm and normalized to the protein concen - tration of the supernatant . Concentrations were measured auto - matically against a standard curve .

Statistical Methods All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Two - tailed Student’s t test was used for comparison of statistical differences in permeability , mucosal mast cell count and tryptase activity between normal subjects and IBS - D patients . Correla - tions were analyzed by Pearson’s correlation . The alpha level of significance was set at P ＜ 0 . 05 . All analyses were performed us - ing SPSS ( version 11 . 5 . 0 ; SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Results Patient Characteristics Sixteen patients with IBS - D ( 10 females , aged 24 - 66 years , mean 54 . 6 years ) and 7 health controls ( 3 females , aged 38 - 64 years , mean 49 . 0 years ) were included . There was no significant difference in age and sex between 2 groups ( P ＞ 0 . 05 , re - spectively ) . The median symptom duration was 65 months ( range 7 - 360 months ) . Comparison of Intestinal Permeability , Tryptase Activity and Mucosal Mast Cell Count Between Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients and Controls Rectal biopsy samples from IBS - D patients showed sig - nificantly increased permeability compared with those from nor - mal controls ( 0 . 64 ± 0 . 08 and 0 . 06 ± 0 . 00 ng / 2 hr / mm 2 , P ＜ 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Tryptase activity was also remarkably higher in rectal biopsy samples from IBS - D patients than those from nor - mal controls ( 0 . 86 ± 0 . 18 and 0 . 28 ± 0 . 04 mU / mg protein , P < 0 . 05 ) . However , mucosal mast cell counts were not significantly Hyuk Lee , et al 248 Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility Figure 3 . Correlation among intestinal permeability , mucosal mast cell count and tryptase activity . ( A ) A significant correlation was found between intestinal permeability and mucosal mast cell count ( r = 0 . 558 , P ＜ 0 . 05 ) . However , there were no notable relationships between intestinal permeability and tryptase activity ( B ) or mucosal mast cell count and tryptase activity ( C ) ( P ＞ 0 . 05 , n = 16 , respectively ) . different between the 2 groups ( 4 . 71 ± 0 . 60 and 4 . 66 ± 0 . 59 number / 0 . 24 mm 2 , P ＞ 0 . 05 ) . Correlation Among Mucosal Mast Cell Count , Tryptase Activity and Intestinal Permeability in Normal Controls There was no remarkable relationship among intestinal per - meability , tryptase activity and mucosal mast cell count in the control group ( P ＞ 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Correlation Among Mucosal Mast Cell Count , Tryptase Activity and Intestinal Permeability in Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients A significant positive correlation between mucosal mast cell count and intestinal permeability was observed ( r = 0 . 558 , P ＜ 0 . 05 ) . However , there were no notable relationships between in - testinal permeability and tryptase activity ( r = - 0 . 347 , P ＞ 0 . 05 ) or mucosal mast cell count and tryptase activity ( r = - 0 . 448 , P ＞ 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Discussion This study demonstrated that mucosal mast cell count is strongly associated with intestinal permeability . Even though there was no significant difference in mucosal mast cell count be - tween IBS - D patients and normal controls , intestinal perme - ability and tryptase activity were significantly higher in biopsy tis - sues from IBS - D patients . There is growing evidence that low grade mucosal in - flammation plays an important role in the development of IBS , 10 with particular attention on mucosal mast cells . Several reports have suggested that IBS patients have a significantly increased number of mucosal mast cells compared with normal controls . 6 , 11 However , other studies have failed to show differences in mu - cosal mast cell count between IBS patients and controls . 12 , 13 In this study , the mucosal mast cell counts of IBS patients were sim - ilar to those of normal controls , while intestinal permeability dif - Mast Cells and Intestinal Permeability in IBS 249 Vol . 19 , No . 2 April , 2013 ( 244 - 250 ) fered between the 2 groups . These results are not consistent with our previous findings of both higher numbers of mucosal mast cells 6 and increased permeability in IBS patients . 9 Although small sample size and differences in symptom se - verity between IBS - D patients could lead to inconsistent results , a possible explanation for this discrepancy in mucosal mast cell count and intestinal permeability between the 2 groups is that ac - tivated mast cells may be associated with increased intestinal per - meability rather than simply an increase in mucosal mast cell count . Compared to biopsy tissues from normal controls , those from IBS patients showed significantly higher tryptase activity , which is an indicator of mast cell activation in various disea - ses . 14 , 15 Therefore , despite having similar numbers of mucosal mast cells , the increased number of activated mast cells may in - duce increased intestinal permeability in IBS patients . One interesting finding from this study was the positive cor - relation between mucosal mast cell count and intestinal perme - ability in IBS patients . In our earlier study , mucosal mast cell count was associated with visceral hypersensitivity in IBS - D patients . 6 Similarly , other studies have reported that increased in - testinal permeability in IBS patients may lead to IBS symptoms and visceral hypersensitivity . 16 , 17 Taken together , these data and our results from the present study support the hypothesis that ac - tivated mast cells may be responsible for the enhanced intestinal permeability and sensitivity observed in IBS patients . Tryptase is the most abundant mediator stored in mast cell granules and has been used as a marker for mast cell activation . 18 Its activation of protease - activated receptor 2 ( PAR - 2 ) on enter - ocytes causes changes in the organization of tight junction and permits the passage of macromolecules across the epithelial barrier . 19 , 20 Although biopsy tissues from IBS patients in the present study exhibited high levels of tryptase activity and in - creased permeability , tryptase activity did not correlate with in - testinal permeability or mucosal mast cell count . This result likely indicates that enhanced tryptase activity is only partially respon - sible for the increased permeability , and that other mast cell me - diators or neural regulators may participate in the control of in - testinal permeability . 3 , 21 Further investigation is needed to identi - fy and verify other mast cell factors that may control intestinal permeability . In conclusion , rectal tissues from IBS - D patients showed in - creased permeability and tryptase activity compared to those from normal controls . In addition , mucosal mast cell number positively correlated with intestinal permeability . These findings will be im - portant in understanding the pathogenesis of increased intestinal permeability in IBS patients . References 1 . Marshall JK , Thabane M , Garg AX .
