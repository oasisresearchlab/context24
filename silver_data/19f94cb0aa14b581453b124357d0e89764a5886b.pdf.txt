For this purpose a three - tiered test was designed ; the first tier was to determine acquaintance of the subject , the second tier was to determine knowledge about the subject . The third tier was to determine alternative conceptions of eighth - grade students ( n = 393 ) . Sample of the study was determined by using convenient sampling . This study is a descriptive research involving two data collection instruments ; “three - tiered test for inheritance subject” and “personal information form” . For analyzing data , frequency and percent values regarding choices of the test for each tier were calculated . Also a map was constructed by considering findings on each tier of the test . According to the findings eight - grades have alternative conceptions about inheritance involving heredity , meiosis and mitosis , chromosome , genetic diseases , adaptation , modification , DNA and regeneration subjects . Also it was determined that lack of knowledge was not a prerequisite for observing alternative conceptions about inheritance , some of the students have acquaintance and knowledge about the subject but they have alternative conceptions about the subject . Keywords : alternative conceptions , inheritance , three - tiered testing , middle school students INTRODUCTION Students are faced with a number of barriers involving alternative conceptions that is affecting their learning in science classes . Alternative conceptions are inconsistent conceptions of students with scientifically accepted concepts ( Yang et al . , 2014 ) . These conceptions are resistant to change by ordinary teaching and pervasive ( Southerland et al . , 2001 ; Eryılmaz , 2002 ) . Science teachers who have to plan their instruction should know alternative conceptions of students and design their courses by considering the alternative conceptions ( Wenning , 2008 ) . Hence providing a valid and reliable way of determining alternative conceptions to science teachers is a beginning point to make suggestions for following instructional adjustments . Students establish their conceptions by conceptual change processes . When students create new conceptions they generally utilize a schema conta ining the existing concepts and they partially change existent schema in learning a new concept . We call this first stage of conceptual changes as “assimilation” . But students might not have an appropriate existent conception to give meaning to a new concept . Hence the learners should change completely existent schema to make new concept meaningful . Here we call this conceptual change as “accommodation” ( Posner et al . , 1982 ) . Individuals might not effectively carry out assimilation and accommodation processes . There are different types of barriers for assimilation and accommodation in developing conceptions . According to Bahar ( 2003 ) alternative conceptions are ideas that are scientifically unacceptable and resistant to change , therefore they are barriers of assimilation and accommodation in developing conceptions . In this case , students have to replace their alternative conceptions with new ones or reorganize them . According to Koray and Köksal & Akkaya / Alternative Conceptions about Inheritance 2 Bal ( 2002 ) alternative conceptions develop in formal education during the teaching of concepts . For example ; alternative conceptions can emerge through incorrectly understanding of scientific concepts by students or insufficient teaching of the concepts by teachers . Fisher ( 1985 ) has listed properties and sources of the alternative conceptions that may occur in individuals in his study as shown below : 1 . One or a group of alternative conceptions can appear in many people . 2 . Alternative conceptions bring about alternative beliefs . 3 . Many alternative conceptions are too difficult to be eliminated by ordinary teaching methods . 4 . Some alternative conceptions are based on experiences in the past of the individual . 5 . Alternative conceptions can originate from a ) genetic basis b ) variety of experiences and c ) teaching in the school environment . Alternative conceptions are generally developed during new learning situations in science classes ( Koray and Bal , 2002 ) . Especially biology topics in science courses bring new concepts to students without determining existent conceptualization and biolog y has concepts coming from a new language such as Latin language . Hence , biology topics should be seriously considered in terms of the formation of alternative conceptions . One of the topics bringing new abstract concepts to biology is inheritance . The development of genetics as a science that affects the pharmaceutical industry has also led to the expansion on inheritance terminology and number of inheritance concepts to be learned ( Lanie et al . , 2004 ) . In the context of the evolving inheritance terminology , there are concepts that elementary level students meet for the first time such as chromosomes , mitosis , meiosis , regeneration , modification and adaptation . Knippels et al . ( 2005 ) have identified major problems as barriers to develop appropriate conceptions regarding inheritance subject . These are abstract nature of concepts , complexity of concepts , requirement of probabilistic reasoning , dense terminology , Punnett diagrams and symbolizations , having inadequate understandings of cell division and insufficient prior knowledge and cognitive maturity . Based on these problems it is clearly observed that alternative conceptions regarding inheritance have deep roots . The studies on alternative conceptions about inheritance also support this notion that students and adults from different educational levels have different alternative conceptions about the inheritance ( Kibuka - Sebitosi , 2007 ; Lanie et al . ( 2004 ) . In a study on 11 th and 12 th grade students’ understanding on inheritance concepts , Kibuka - Sebitosi ( 2007 ) determined that students had alternative conceptions about nature of genetic knowledge in cells . As a result of analyzing concepts maps , he found that the students had also problems about understanding some inheritance concepts . These concepts are ; a ) differences between genes and chromosomes , b ) definition of inheritance , c ) definition of Mendelian inheritance . Banet and Ayuso ( 2000 ) ’s study showed that students have alternative conceptions on the meiosis . They also could not understand concepts of homozygotes and heterozygotes . Lanie et al . ( 2004 ) asked 2 questions to the participants in their study conducted with 62 adults . The first question was “are ability and behavior hereditary ? ” . The second question was “do genes occupy a special place in the body ? ” . As a result of the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the answers to the questions , it was seen that people were familiar with inheritance issues through mass media devices but there are uncertainties or misunderstandings in the minds of the people in answers to the asked questions . For instance , as an answer to “do the genes occupy a special place in the body ? ” question , approximately 34 % of participants answered correctly and 23 % expressed that it is in the brain . The remaining percent answered that it is in the heart , bones , blood , reproductive cells . In Williams , Debarger , Montgomery , Zhou and Tate ( 2011 ) ’s study , the authors determined 7 th grade students ( n = 209 ) ’s difficulties in understanding differences between meiosis and mitosis processes . Moreover it was also seen that students having medium and low level of knowledge had difficulties in understanding of the spindles in cell division and their role in the genetic transfer . Hence the findings of this study drive us to study alternative conceptions by considering acquaintance and lack of knowledge about inheritance . In the studies above , except for the last one , there was no explicit strategy for discriminating lack of knowledge and acquaintance from alternative conceptions . When looked at the literature ( Banet and Ayuso , 2000 ; Lanie et al . , 2004 ; Lewis and Kattmann , 2004 ; Knippels et al . , 2005 ; Kibuka - Sebitosi , 2007 ; Williams et al . , 2011 ) , it might be summarized that there is a number of alternative conceptions as barriers for teaching and learning of inheritance concepts and the first step in bringing a solution to the problem requires discriminating alternative conceptions from insufficient acquaintance and lack of knowledge for making description meaningful . In the study of Lanie et al . ( 2004 ) they stated that whether the participants know the concept of gene and heredity affects their answer to alternative conception situations . However determining alternative conceptions is not an easy task and multi - sided issue . First we have to determine acquaintance of the subject and then we have to separate lack of knowledge from alternative conceptions . So there is a need to apply three - tiered approach ( identifying acquaintance , knowledge levels and alternative conceptions respectively ) to determine alternative conceptions regarding inheritance . By this way we can determine purer alternative conceptions regarding inheritance than alternative conceptions determined by just applying one test or one - shot questioning . European J Hlth Biol 3 As seen in the literature alternative conceptions are sometimes confused with the lack of knowledge about inheritance . Every unscientific explanation is not an alternative conception . Let’s talk about a student : if this student defines the chromosome unscientifically , we cannot say that “the student has alternative conception about the chromosome” . This definition might be caused of conceptual confusion , lack of knowledge or alternative conception . If the student is aware of this unscientific explanation or definition and changes this explanation or definition without any instruction in a short time , and the student do not have sufficient acquaintance of the concept we can say clearly that this student has represented a conceptual confusion . But , if the student says own explanation or definition is absolutely true and it cannot be changed by the ordinary instruction and the explanation or definition is about meaning of the concept then we can say that the student has an alternative conception about chromosome concept ( Güneş , 2007 ) . Also th e student might define chromosome by using insufficient knowledge background and it can be changed by the ordinary instruction in a short time and the explanation or definition is about definition of the concept without explaining meaningful associations with other concepts . In this situation we can say that the students have lack of knowledge . Therefore the aim of this study was to determine alternative conceptions about the inheritance on eighth grade students , by determining and discriminating their acquaintance and lack of knowledge about inheritance . METHOD OF THE STUDY In this study quantitative cross - sectional descriptive method was used ( Frankel and Wallen , 2003 ) . Two instruments were used for data collection three - tiered test for inheritance subject and personal information form . In developing the “Three - tiered test for inheritance subject” , content validity , difficulty , discrimination , internal consistency analyses were performed for validity and reliability evidence . Pilot study for understandability and format of the test was done with 8 th grade students ( n = 8 ) . The final form of the test was applied to 393 8 th grade students . Convenient sampling approach was used in this research . Table 1 summarizes characteristics of the participants . Validity and Reliability Studies of the Three - tiered Test for Inheritance Subject The test has three tiers ; Yes - No questions for acquaintance about the aspects of the subject , multiple choice questions for knowledge background regarding the concepts of the subject and multiple choice alternative conception questions for concepts of inheritance subject . The concepts regarding “inheritance” subject were determined by considering the content of 8th grade “Cell Division and Inheritance” unit in the first stage of preparing the test . A table of specification was established for content validity . In the first tier , the purpose of YES / NO questions is to determine whether the student has prior acquaintance with the concepts . If students answered “NO” to the first tier questions , they should not give answer to the multiple - choice questions . The multiple - choice questions on the alternative conceptions aimed to determine the alternative conceptions about the concepts after being sure that students are acquainted with the concept and have knowledge about the concepts . The questions on alternative conceptions regarding the concepts were determined by considering the alternative conception statements provided by the literature . Also expert opinion about the questions on knowledge regarding inheritance and alternative conceptions was taken . The prepared questions were applied to eight students as a pilot study for understandability and format of the test . The final form of the test consisted of 43 questions . All the questions in the final form of the test were also evaluated by one science education expert and three science teachers in terms of readability , understandability level and conformity for determining alternative conception and knowledge levels . The final questions were also checked for appropriateness of the number of questions , grammar and spelling errors . The final form of the test was applied to the 392 eighth grade students .

They were just used for checking acquaintance . The data of multiple - choice questions were analyzed by ITEMAN program . The findings are represented in the Table 3 . The alpha value as . 87 in Table 3 shows an acceptable value as an internal consistency evidence of the measurement tool ( Rudner and Schafer , 2002 ) . Discrimination level of the test scores ( Point biserial correlation ) has been determined as over . 25 it is an acceptable value ( Wells and Wollack , 2003 ) . Also it has been observed that difficulty level of questions in the measurement tool has . 57 that means a medium level difficulty . FINDINGS The data collected by the test showed that approximately all of the participants were acquainted with the concepts regarding inheritance subject except for “regeneration” concept . Table 4 represents acquaintance situation of the participants about the concepts of inheritance . As seen in Table 4 , great majority of the participants acquainted with nearly all of the concepts of inheritance except for “regeneration” concept . In spite of their acquaintance with the concepts , small number of the students did not have any acquaintance with the concepts . After determining the participants’ acquaintance with the concept , second tier of the test was examined and the results showed that the students do not have acceptable knowledge about the concepts of inheritance .

However less than 50 % of the participants have sufficient knowledge background about heredity ; genetically transferability of nevus , dominancy of parental genes , genetic similarity of different cell types . About 50 % of the participants have sufficient knowledge background about genetic diseases ; transfer of hemophilia , transfer of genetic diseases from mother to baby , dominancy of genes of genetic diseases and genetically transfer of diseases caused by an accident . Over the 60 % of the participants have sufficient knowledge background about modification ; genetically transfer of physical changes and genetically transfer of blindness caused by an accident . For the adaptation concept , their level of knowledge was higher ( over 50 % ) for occurrence of adaptations at the level of phenotype while level of knowledge was low ( 36 % ) for occurrence of adaptations at the level of genotype and individual . As another concept , knowledge levels of the participants about “regeneration” ; occurrence of regeneration in humans and regeneration of severed ear , were not as high as expected . Less than 50 % of the participants answered correctly to the questions . Knowledge levels of the participants about “DNA” ; Place of DNA in body cells , DNA replication , existence of DNA in reproduction cells were high , majority of the participants ( over 65 % ) answered correctly to the questions . For the meiosis and mitosis concepts ; occurrence in plants , broken bones , role of meiosis and mitosis in evolution and reproduction , unfortunately less than 50 % of the participants answered correctly to the questions . After determining knowledge levels of the participants , their alternative conceptions were determined by using conceptual questions . The findings are represented in Table 6 . As seen in Table 6 , the students have alternative conceptions regarding the concepts of inheritance subjects . Their percent values about alternative conceptions for the chromosome , heredity , genetic disease , modification , adaptation , regeneration , DNA , meiosis and mitosis are 19 % , 48 % , 19 % , 31 % , 25 % , 22 % , 44 % , 60 % and 25 % respectively . As an example , if we look at all the tables ( Table 4 , 5 and 6 ) together , it can be seen that most of the students ( 98 . 72 % ) declared they have acquaintance with chromosome concept , over 53 % of them have knowledge about chromosome concept and 19 % of the students have alternative conceptions about chromosome concept . Comparison of the percent values regarding acquaintance , level of knowledge and alternative conceptions is made in Table 7 . As seen in Table 7 , acquainting a concept of heredity and having knowledge about it do not guarantee lack of alternative conceptions about the concepts of inheritance . Hence it is seen that for measuring alternative conceptions , use of conceptual questions rather than knowledge questions leads to different findings about alternative conceptions .

According to findings obtained in this study , the students were acquainted with the concepts of inheritance , since they took courses on the concepts before the eight grade . However they had limited knowledge about the concepts . In literature elementary level students’ lack of knowledge about the concepts of inheritance was shown ( Williams et al . , 2012 ; Lewis and Wood - Robinson , 2000 ) . Williams et al . ( 2012 ) studied understandings of 209 seventh graders on the relationship between cell division and genetic inheritance . They found that the students did not have strong knowledge background , for example some of them could not explain the association of mitotic and meiotic divisions with genetic information . Also Lewis and Wood - Robinson ( 2000 ) studied knowledge background of 482 students aged 14 - 16 . They found that the students had a poor understanding of the genetic information transfer and a lack of basic knowledge about gene and chromosome concepts . After collection of information regarding acquaintance and lack of knowledge about the concepts of inheritance , there is a need to collect data about alternative conceptions of the students to decide about their conceptual understandings regarding the concepts . Hence three - tiered approach of assessment in conceptual understanding studies provides advantage in discriminating the problems rooted from acquaintance and lack of knowledge , alternative conceptions in conceptual understandings . In further analysis the data showed that the students had different alternative conceptions about inheritance subject . Alternative conceptions of 8 th grade students about “Cell Division and Inheritance” unit mostly focus on heredity , modification , DNA , mitosis and meiosis concepts . In the literature ( Banet and Ayuso , 2000 ; Lanie et al . , 2004 ; Lewis and Kattmann , 2004 ; Knippels et al . , 2005 ; Kibuka - Sebitosi , 2007 ; Williams et al . , 2011 ) we observed that students had similar alternative conceptions . In our study , it can be seen clearly that students seriously having problems especially about , heredity , DNA and meiosis . When literature examined ( Banet and Ayuso , 2000 ; Lanie et al . , 2004 ; Lewis and Kattmann , 2004 ; Knippels et al . , 2005 ) it was observed that existence of this problem was supported by our work . By using three - tiered assessment approach we can also draw path of conceptual understanding of the group . According to findings of our study , the group of the students represented a path of conceptual understating on the concepts . This path is presented in Figure 1 . Table 7 .

Map of Conceptual Understanding Path of the Students Students Those who have past experiences related to concept Those who have knowledge about the concept Those who do not have alternative conception Those who have alternative conception Those who have lack of knowledge about the concept Those who not have past experiences related concepts Köksal & Akkaya / Alternative Conceptions about Inheritance 10 As seen in Figure 1 , the students were classified in terms of their past experiences about the concepts so prior learning or experiences related to the concept was determined before determining alternative conceptions . This is an important condition in the formation of alternative conceptions . Individuals who have not any previous experience or acquaintance regarding a concept cannot develop alternative conceptions . Hence determining alternative conceptions without asking the participants’ previous acquaintance might drive the researcher to urge the participants to give answer to the test questions about which they have no idea . According to our findings , students having past experience about the concepts emerge as two different groups as the students having knowledge and the students having lack of knowledge . But both of the group represented alternative conceptions regarding the concepts of inheritance . This part of the path shows that having knowledge about a concept does not guarantee to have a conceptual understanding about a concept . So there is a need to assess alternative conceptions by discriminating them from acquaintance problem and lack of knowledge about the inheritance . In spite of the valuable contributions of this study , the following studies should make the following suggestions ; 1 - T he sample size in next studies should be expanded . 2 - Research is limited to certain concepts ( chromosomes , genetics , genetic diseases , modification , adaptation , regeneration , DNA , mitosis , meiosis ) in the “Cell Division and Inheritance” unit . Other concepts on this issue should be studied . 3 - Gender differences should be addressed . REFERENCES Ayas , A . , Çepni , S . , Akdeniz , A . R . , Özmen , H . , Yiğit , N . , & Ayvacı , H . Ş .
