GFP + neuroblasts are absent in the RMS at 14 dpi . B . GFP + , NeuN + GC ( arrows ) at 42 dpi within GC layer . C . Photographs of OB imaged through a cranial window at 20 ( left ) and 60 ( right ) days after surgery . D . Immunolabeling of astrocytes ( GFAP - red ) and microglia ( Iba - 1 - green ) comparing between an OB where no window was performed , 14 , 28 days post - window surgery and a positive control “failed” window with elevated Iba - 1 and GFAP ( arrow ) .

Sample images , tracings and data analysis procedure for tracking spine dynamics and 2 - day interval control experiment , Related to Figure 2 and Experimental Procedures A . Example images of a GC dendritic segment from 52 dpi to 74 dpi ( Movie S2 ) . B . Tracings of dendritic segment ( grey ) and spines ( blue ) as in A with overlaid white horizontal lines tracking individual spines to demarcate the location and duration of a spine . C . The horizontal line image in ( B ) was processed using a custom MatLab script which produced binary output of the line structure and automatic calculation of the number of stable ( yellow ) , new ( blue ) and lost ( red ) spines at each time - point . D . To determine whether numerous 2 - day anesthetized imaging sessions was artificially affecting the spine dynamics , injections and cranial windows were performed as outlined previously except the mice had a 10 - day period without imaging between the 2 - day 2 interval imaging series . If the multiple imaging sessions were artificially causing enhanced dynamics , there would be a significant difference in the spine dynamics before ( 72 - 74 dpi ) and after the 10 - day no - imaging period ( 84 - 86 dpi ) . E . Sample images of same dendritic segment at 72 - 74 dpi and 84 - 86 dpi with stable ( closed arrowheads with numbers indexing stable spines ) , new ( open arrowhead ) and lost ( asterisk ) spines . There was no noticeable morphological difference between the before and after imaging gap spines . F . Plot of change between stable , new and lost spines from 72 - 74 dpi to 84 - 86 dpi with raw ( open circle , lines ) and averaged ± SEM ( close circle ) values . Between the groups , no significant difference in the dynamics was observed supporting that 2 - day interval imaging was not causing enhanced spine dynamics .

Scale bar : ( A ) , 2 µ m . Figure S5 . Measurement of puncta dynamics at different time scales , Related to Figure 5 A - B . Example time - series of dendrites imaged at a 10 - min ( A ) or 1 - day interval ( B ) . Stable ( blue ) , new ( red ) and lost ( orange ) puncta are identified with respect to their next observation , as well as isolated ( solo ) puncta that are observed only once ( gray ) . C - G . Puncta movement between 10 - min observations ( C ) reflects mostly optical changes , with a small increase in movement when mice were re - positioned between 3 images ( 10 - min disp . ) . One - day observations show markedly higher movement indicating real movement of puncta in addition to jitter due to optical changes . Survival of initially observed puncta ( D ) reflecting the survival likelihood ( E ) at 10 - min ( 7 . 4 ± 2 . 2 % new / day ; 7 . 6 ± 2 . 3 % lost / day , n = 21 dendrite segments ) and 1 - day intervals ( 13 . 6 ± 4 . 1 % new / day , p < 1 . 0x10 - 4 ; 13 . 4 ± 3 . 5 % lost / day , p < 1 . 0x10 - 4 , n = 56 dendrite segments from pooled MCs and TCs ) . Detection parameters were modified to observe its effects on puncta gain ( F ) and loss ( G ) . Detection threshold ( as percentage of pixels ) was changed to values greater and less than the value used in the main text ( threshold = 1 . 0 % ) . Detection radius was changed to greater and less than the value reported in the main text ( radius = 3 pixels ) . H . Validation of automatic detection parameters used human observers who were blinded to the identity of the dendrite segment ( MC , TC , 10 - min interval , 1 - day interval ; 20 segments to each observer ) . The mean difference between dynamics scored from 10 - min and 1 - day observation intervals was 5 . 1 % for puncta gained , and 5 . 2 % for puncta lost . Scale bar : ( A and B ) , 5 µ m . Figure S6 . Teal - gephyrin surface density and turnover does not change along the length of the lateral dendrite , Related to Figure 6 A . Surface density of teal - gephyrin puncta does not change along tufted cell lateral dendrites ( blue : p = 0 . 1315 , r 2 = 0 . 096 ) and moderately increases along mitral cell lateral dendrites ( red : p = 0 . 0433 , r 2 = 0 . 1427 ) , although the regression slopes between these two groups are not significantly different ( p = 0 . 4074 ) . B . The diameter of the lateral dendrite showed no significant change over distance in tufted cells ( blue : p = 0 . 0892 , r 2 = 0 . 1205 ) or mitral cells ( red : p = 0 . 4216 , r 2 = 0 . 0241 ) . C . Turnover does not change along the tufted cell lateral dendrite ( blue : new puncta , p = 0 . 1633 , r 2 = 0 . 08271 ; red : lost puncta , p = 0 . 7156 , r 2 = 0 . 005882 ) . D . Turnover does not change along the mitral cell lateral dendrite ( blue : new puncta , p = 0 . 5908 , r 2 = 0 . 0109 ; red : lost puncta , p = 0 . 2249 , r 2 = 0 . 0541 ) . Figure S7 . Synapse turnover statistics : experiment and modeling , Related to Figure 7 A . Same as Figure 7C but using synthetic circuit memory ( N = 14 circuits x 36 odors ; Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . Natural and artificial inputs were pooled because they gave statistically indiscriminable results . B . Branch for branch comparison of survival probability between young ( < 10 days ) and all spines . Same data set as colored bars in Figure 7D . See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details on significance test . C . Same analysis as in Figure 7D but for gephyrin puncta instead of spines and for a deviating imaging schedule , N = 47 branches . D . Steady - state distribution of Hebbian score ( “synapse resilience” ; gray bars , a . u . ) in computer experiments ( N = 16 trials , M = 40 , 000 synapses ) and resilience - dependence of the probability to survive the next time step ( 3 h , red dashed line ) . 4 E . Average autocorrelogram of normalized ( z score ) MC response waveforms in the quasi steady state ( N = 16 trials , M = 12 odors , K = 120 MCs ) . F . Average cross - correlogram between stimulus - averaged normalized MC response and normalized average resilience of synapses innervating the MC . G . Pattern stability as in Figure 7E , except simulation comprises three phases ( top bar ) . Slow Ornstein - Uhlenbeck fluctuations in the input starts with phase 2 at t = 250 days . Structural plasticity partially compensated for the fluctuations in the MC response . When structural plasticity is switched off ( phase 3 , 500 - 750 days ) MC pattern stability drops significantly . H . Output pattern correlations as in Figure 7G except simulation comprises three phases ( cf . G ) . Structural plasticity compensates for input fluctuations ( phase 2 ) which otherwise substantially impair pattern decorrelation ( phase 3 ) . I . Structural plasticity allows for efficient adaptation to changing odor environments ( top bar ) . Odor set 1 is the same as in most other simulations , whereas odor set 2 comprises 12 different stimuli . Average MC correlation r 0 . 6 was evaluated separately for odor sets 1 ( red ) and 2 ( blue ) . J . Average output pattern correlation of pairs of similar odors in the odor environment ( black symbols ) and for similar , but novel odors ( gray symbols ) as a function of the effective age dependence of synapse survival . The age dependence was reduced by decreasing the sharpness γ of the survival threshold from γ = 50 ( used in Figure 7 ) to γ = 0 . 16 . 5 Supplemental Movies Movie S1 .

Scale bar : 5 µ m . 6 Supplemental Experimental Procedures Animals All animal procedures in the study were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee , the European Communities Council Directive of November 24 , 1986 ( 86 / 609 / EEC ) and by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Pasteur Institute . C57BL / 6J male mice ( Janvier France ) were used for adult and early postnatal studies and all transgenic strains were with a C57BL / 6J background . Viral expression of fluorescent proteins in GCs and MC / TCs For the dendritic and spine development studies , engineered self - inactivating murine oncoretrovirus expressing GFP under the ubiquitin - C promoter was produced as previously described ( Ge et al . , 2005 ) . Adult ( P70 ) and early postnatal ( P14 ) C57BL / 6 mice ( Charles River ) were anesthetized with ketamine ( 100 mg / kg ) xylazine ( 10 mg / kg ) anesthesia , injected with buprenorphine ( 0 . 02 mg / kg ) for post - operative analgesia and the head was secured to a stereotaxic frame ( David Kopf ) . The skull surface was exposed and retrovirus was injected ( 1 µ l per site ) into the subventricular zone using a 26 gage needle at the following coordinates relative to bregma ( Carleton et al . , 2003 ) : Postnatal day 70 ( P70 ) anterior = + 1 . 0 mm , lateral = ±1 . 0 mm , ventral = + 2 . 2 mm ; anterior = + 0 . 0 mm , lateral = ±1 . 8 mm , ventral = + 1 . 6 mm ; ( P14 ) anterior = + 1 . 0 mm , lateral = ±1 . 0 mm , ventral = + 2 . 2 mm . anterior = + 0 . 0 mm , lateral = ±1 . 75 mm , ventral = + 2 . 0 mm . The scalp was sutured and the mice were returned to their standard housing with free access to food and water . To label MC and TC inhibitory synapses , Tbet - Cre mice ( Haddad et al . , 2013 ) were injected in the OB with floxed lentivirus expressing a teal - gephyrin fusion ( Ubiquitin - C - Teal - gephyrin ; ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) ) at the injection schedule as outlined in Figure 5A . Mice were injected with 100 nl of virus distributed along 4 sites 300 - 600 µ m deep into the center of the dorsal OB . Cranial window procedure Mice were anesthetized with ketamine / xylazine anesthesia and body temperature was maintained at 37° C . For GC experiments , a 1 . 0 mm x 1 . 2 mm rectangular craniotomy over each OB hemisphere or for MC puncta experiments , one 3 . 0 x 1 . 4 mm window over both OB hemispheres was performed by carefully cutting the bone with a # 12 scalpel blade . With this technique , in contrast to high speed drilling , there was no risk of friction - heat induced damage . Custom cut rectangular coverglass of the same dimensions as the craniotomies was produced using a semiconductor - dicing saw ( University of Wisconsin Applied Microelectronics Laboratory ) . The glass was carefully placed over the craniotomy and the perimeter was sealed with dental cement ( C & B Metabond , Parkell , Inc . ) . A stainless steel head - bar was glued to the skull ( cyanoacrylate ) , midline and posterior to bregma , and the exposed skull surface was covered with dental cement . For the experiments where virus was injected after the cranial window preparation , the skull injection region was not cemented , the bregma location was marked and the scalp was sutured . Cranial windows were screened and 7 only clear windows without bone regeneration were used . The same dual cranial window preparation and complete procedure was performed on adult ( ~ P100 ) Thy - 1 - GFM - M mice ( Feng et al . , 2000 ) over motor cortex . In vivo Imaging procedure for tracking GC dendrite and spine dynamics The mice for imaging were anesthetized with isofluorane ( 1 . 3 % ) and body temperature was maintained with a feedback - heating pad to maintain body temperature at 37° C . The implanted metal head - bar was secured to a custom imaging stage . For the GC experiments , a 2 - photon microscope ( LSM510 Meta , Carl Zeiss ) with a 20x 1 . 0 NA water objective ( Carl Zeiss ) , a Chameleon Ti : Sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser ( Coherent ) tuned to 910 nm was used . For the MC gephyrin puncta experiments , a Prairie Ultima ( Bruker ) microscope with a 25x 1 . 05 NA water objective and a DeepSee Ti : Sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser ( Spectra Physics ) was tuned to 915 nm . Special care was taken to use minimal laser power and the signal intensity was compared with the prior imaging session to have similar brightness and contrast between time - points . Image stacks were acquired at 0 . 44 µ m x 0 . 44 µ m x 3 µ m resolution ( supplemental movies 1 and 2 ) and the identical region from the previous time - point was located by comparing blood vessel surface landmarks and GFP + GC / periglomerular neuron structures with the previous imaging session . Thy - 1 - GFP - M mice were imaged at the same laser power as in the OB imaging , but the detector gain was reduced due to the Thy - 1 - GFP - M signal being significantly brighter . After imaging , the mice were returned to their cages at the animal facility under normal housing conditions . For short - term imaging , the mice were lightly anesthetized with isofluorane and images were acquired every 10 - min for 90 min . In vivo Imaging procedure for MC puncta experiments There are multiple types of optical distortions that can be conflated with real puncta movement . These include : intensity changes due to moving blood vessel shadows following rotational repositioning error , heart - rate compression distortions from tissue near arterial vessels , and breathing rate tissue compression . We minimized the first and second type of distortions by judiciously selecting dendrite segments , and the third distortion through careful monitoring of anesthesia depth and increasing the rigidity of head fixation . Imaging of diffraction limited puncta used a 25x 1 . 05 NA water immersion objective ( Olympus ; 0 . 182 µm / pixel ) to capture large tissue volumes ( 373 µm x 373 µm x ~ 250 µm , xyz ) . The objective back - aperature was under - filled to increase excitation efficiency during deep imaging , and to elongate the axial point - spread function in order to minimize the effect of axial distortions . From images of puncta taken at all depths , we estimated the average point - spread function to be ~ 0 . 6 µ m in the horizontal plane ( full - width at half - maximum ) , and ~ 5 µ m in the axial plane . Our 915 nm laser was dispersion - corrected , and its power scaled with image depth but remained under 40 mW ( measured at the back aperture ) on all imaging days . Image processing and analysis for GC dendrite and spine dynamics 8 Image stacks were deconvolved using a blind deconvolution method with spherical aberration correction ( Autoquant , Media Cybernetics ) . Two overlapping fields of view were stitched using VIAS software ( CNIC , Mount Sinai School of Medicine ) for the dendritic analysis . The complete apical dendritic structure of the GCs was traced with the origin at the soma using 3 - D Imaris software’s semi - automatic filament tracer plugin ( Bitplane ) while visualizing the structure with 3D glasses ( 3D vision , Nvidia ) . This system provided depth perception to effectively tease apart the complex dendritic branch assignments . Due to the long migratory stream , the birth - dating of the GCs was somewhat imprecise , therefore the data were aligned to the time - point where the dendritic length growth saturated to less than 20 % of the length of the previous time - point . In addition , since there was high diversity of the maximum dendritic length of the GCs ( range ~ 650 - 1500 µ m ) , the percent maximum dendritic length was calculated for each GC using the average dendritic length from 36 - 58 dpi as 100 % ( represented as dashed box in Figure 1D ) . Scholl analysis anchored from the first branch point of the GC was measured using Imaris software . Dendritic spines were termed “spines” in a broad definition , which encompasses stable mushroom - like spines ranging to dynamic filopodia - like spines . For measuring spine dynamics , dendritic segments greater than 70 µ m that were mainly parallel to the imaging plane and free of overlap with other dendritic branches were selected . The segment and spines were traced in 3D using the Imaris filament tracer plugin with the 2 - photon image stacks visualized using a “fire” heatmap and a 2D x - y orthoslice plane to aid visualization . The previous time - point was open in a separate window and compared to insure the spine structures were properly traced . Only spines lateral to the dendritic shaft and parallel to the x - y imaging plane were traced since spines projecting into the z - plane were difficult to discriminate , due to axial - spreading . 2D , equally scaled tracing images of each traced time - point were aligned using “StackReg” rigid registration in Fiji ( ImageJ , NIH ) . The aligned images were adjacently arrayed for all time - points in Illustrator ( Adobe ) and horizontal lines were manually overlaid to track the spines over time . Spines were counted as stable across 2 time - points if in the following time - point the spine was within 3 µ m along the dendritic shaft of the previous time - point spine location . The overlaid lines were exported and a custom MatLab ( MathWorks , 2009b ) script was used to extract the number of stable , new and lost spines at each time - point . The percent total spines were calculated as stable : ( 100 × N stable spines N total spines ) , new : ( 100 × N new spines N total spines ) and lost : ( 100 × N lost spines N total spines ) , where N total spines was the total number of spines at the given time - point ( N stable spines + N new spines + N lost spines ) . Data are presented as mean ± SEM and statistical analysis was performed using one - way ANOVA with Origin software ( OriginLab ) . Heatmap overlays of multiple time - points were constructed by first rigid body registration ( StackReg , FIJI ) , dividing the gray level by the number of images and projecting the final summed image using a colormap . Image processing and analysis for MC puncta experiments High - resolution z - stacks containing teal - gephyrin puncta were first de - noised using a 2d median filter , and then were internally registered ( StackReg , FIJI ) to remove translational movements that may have occurred during imaging . A second red channel was used to 9 detect wideband autoflourescence , and using a bandpass filter in RGB space to preserve chromatically pure teal emission , this channel was subtracted from the teal channel . 8 - bit grayscale stacks within a time - series were registered to a common stack using first an affine transformation to correct for translation , rotation and compression changes between days , and then with a constrained bs - spline transform ( 3D Slicer 4 . 3 . 1 , http : / / slicer . org , ( Fedorov et al . , 2012 ) ) to correct for registration errors imposed by the initial rigid stack transform . Affine and spline transformations were applied to downsampled data and thus were not sensitive to puncta positions , and the bs - spline field acted on a 75 micron cubic grid to avoid warping features at the scale of puncta analysis . Following volume registration , neurons were traced in Imaris , and sub - volumes containing a traced dendritic segment were manually defined for further puncta analysis . Z - stacks around each segment were flattened using a maximum intensity projection and combined into time - stacks for the duration of observation . All z - projected images containing dendrite segments were histogram equalized to a common template to normalize relative puncta brightness within the dataset . Puncta within time - stacks were then detected by fitting Gaussians with a three - pixel radius to local maxima above a set threshold ( 1 . 0 % ) in each image ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ) . This threshold was chosen after systematically scanning different thresholds and measuring its impact on puncta loss , gain , and displacement , and a range of thresholds was identified that minimized the change in these measurements ( also see Figure S5F , G ) . Puncta were linked between images in a time - stack if the fitted centroid moved less than a defined detection radius ( 1 . 44 µm ) . To count as new or lost , a punctum must have had at least two consecutive observations ( excluding the first and last ) , thus isolated detections were not counted , and are identified in figures as “solo puncta” . The same isolated “solo” events were excluded in the 1 - day spine dynamics in Figure 6F . Lifetime measurements considered only puncta that were initially present on the first observation , and this measurement simply counted observations until disappearance . We found that puncta displacement between observations was increased when the microscope objective and cranial window was subjected to water re - immersion and repositioning between each stack ( Figure S5C ) . Imaging at a 1 - day interval produced larger puncta displacements , likely due to mixed real and artefactual movement , but this variation nonetheless had a low median value of ~ 2 . 5 pixels ( 440 nm ) . These measurements were used to define the maximum displacement of a punctum between days before we would classify it as a separate punctum ( 1 . 44 µm or 8 pixels ; Figure S5C ) . Subtracting the values of 10 - minute turnover from one - day turnover gave a jitter - corrected estimation of 6 . 2 % gain per day and 5 . 8 % loss per day . In parallel to the calculation of gain and loss per day , we used an alternative measure of turnover that considered the probability of survival of all initially observed puncta in a dendrite segment ( Figure S5D ) . This alternative method gave a similar estimation of puncta lifetime ( 10 - min : 92 . 3 ± 2 . 2 % survival ; 1 - day : 86 ± 2 . 8 % survival , Figure S5E ) of 6 . 3 % loss per day . These values were not sensitive to repetitive imaging because there was no difference in the first half versus last half of eight - day imaging periods in puncta gained 10 ( p = 0 . 30 , data not shown ) or puncta lost ( p = 0 . 20 , data not shown ) , nor were the shape of puncta intensity distributions significantly different between the first and eighth days of puncta observation ( kstest , p = 0 . 14 , data not shown ) . Unless otherwise indicated multiple comparisons testing of puncta data used a 1 - way ANOVA with Tukey ' s post - hoc test ( Prism 6 , GraphPad ) . Cumulative distributions were compared using a two - sample Kolmogorov - Smirnov test ( kstest2 , Matlab r2014a ) . Linear regression used a least squares fit and logistic fitting used a four - parameter logistic equation with a maximum value taken from the average of the data in Figure 6B . Regression tests used a sum - of - squares F - test ( Prism 6 , GraphPad ) . Numbers in text represent population means , and unless otherwise marked errors are one standard deviation . Boxes represent middle quartiles with identified median , and whiskers extend to 95 % confidence . Manual gephyrin puncta detection A subset of images from the in vivo puncta imaging were randomly chosen between experimental groups and blinded . The images were aligned for tracking using the same method as in spine detection ( Figure S2A , B ) . Seven neuroscientists were assigned to track the gephyrin puncta over time based on their own criteria . Immunohistochemistry A cohort of mice was anesthetized and trans - cardiac perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde , the brain was removed , post - fixed overnight and equilibrated with 30 % sucrose in PBS . Forty micron sagittal sections were cut using a sliding microtome . The sections were washed in PBS , blocked with normal donkey serum and incubated in various combinations of the following antibodies : Goat anti - DCX ( 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , mouse anti - NeuN ( 1 : 500 , Millipore ) , mouse anti - GFAP ( 1 : 500 , Millipore ) , rabbit anti - Ed - 1 ( 1 : 1000 , Wako ) , mouse anti - gephyrin ( 1 : 500 , Sysy ) , rabbit anti - GABA A - α 1 ( 1 : 2000 , Sysy ) and rabbit anti - GABA A - α 2 ( 1 : 1000 , Sysy ) . The sections were washed and then incubated with species - matched Cy2 , Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent secondary donkey antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) along with 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) to label nuclei . The sections were mounted onto slides and confocal imaged ( Carl Zeiss ) . Cranial window damage analysis The “failed window” group had a normal craniotomy surgical procedure but the OB was punctured multiple times at a depth of 500 µ m with a ~ 20 µ m diameter tip glass pipet to induce inflammation ( similar procedure for OB virus injection ( Kato et al . , 2012 ) ) . Tiled confocal images brain sections with Iba - 1 and GFAP immunostaining of each experimental group were acquired . Regions of interest were made in the external plexiform layer of the dorsal and ventra - anterior of the OB ( FIJI ) , the mean intensity was measured and the dorsal / ventral intensity ratio was calculated . The external plexiform layer was chosen since this is where GCs project their dendrites and is where the spine analysis occurred ( dorsal ) . The ventral region of interest provided an internal control region without damage and was used to normalize between different brain sections . 11 Spine and gephyrin puncta lifetime analysis In Figures 7B and S7C the frequencies of spines / puncta of a given age were corrected for bias in favor of younger ages ( for example assuming a 7 session analysis window age a = 5 can only be observed at the last session whereas age a = 0 can be observed at any session except the very first ) . To simplify statistical analysis this correction was not applied to Figure S7B . In this Figure S7B statistical significance against the null hypothesis that young spines have indiscriminable survival probability from all spines , and thus form a random subset was calculated by brute - force evaluation of the formula 𝑝 = 2 𝑆 𝑖 𝑁 − 𝑆 𝑛 − 𝑖 ) * + , 𝑁 𝑛 ( 1 ) This formula computes the two - sided tail probability of observing s or fewer session - to - session survivals of young spines given the number N of all observations , S of all session - to - session survivals and , n of all observations of young spines . To avoid numerical problems , all steps bar the final quotient , were carried out using arbitrary size integer arithmetic . Weighted SEM : an unbiased estimate of the variance of the weighted mean 𝜇 = 𝐰 , 𝐗 𝑤 * ( 2 ) where 𝐰 , 𝐗 = 𝑤 * 𝑋 * denotes the scalar product of the weight and sample vectors w and X was calculated by the formula var 𝜇 = 𝐰 6 , 𝐓 89 𝐗 − 𝜇 6 𝑤 * 6 ( 3 ) where the squares in the numerator are taken component - wise and T is the matrix with entries 𝑇 * ; = 𝑤 ; 6 𝑤 * 6 + 𝛿 * ; 1 − 2 𝑤 ; 𝑤 * ( 4 ) This method assumes that the X i are independent and all have the same mean but tolerates different variances , a situation that for example arises when the X i are averages of different numbers w i of Bernoulli trials . Under these assumptions T maps the true variances E ( [ X - E ( µ ) ] 2 ) to the expected sample variances E ( [ X - µ ] 2 ) ; the factor T - 1 generalizes the well - known correction factor N / ( N - 1 ) used to obtain an unbiased estimate from the sample variance when all weights w i = 1 / N are equal . Computational OB model with spine dynamics The model is adapted from an established model ( Chow et al . , 2012 ) . For given connectivity , model dynamics are governed by a set of linear , ordinary differential equations 𝐌 @ = −𝐌 @ + 𝐒 @ − 𝐖𝐆 @ 𝐆 @ = −𝐆 @ + 𝐖𝐌 @ D ( 5 ) where M ( α ) , G ( α ) and S ( α ) are vectors representing instantaneous firing rates of the N MC = 120 mitral cells , N GC = 2 , 000 granule cells , and N MC = 120 ORNs , respectively , in response to stimulus α . A dot on top of a vector indicates the temporal derivative , W is the GC - to - MC connection matrix and t W its transpose whose use as the MC - to - GC 12 connection matrix is the mathematical representation of synapse reciprocity . This system converges to a unique , globally attractive steady state ( Seung et al . , 1998 ) 𝐌 @ = 𝐢𝐝 + 𝐖 𝐖 D 89 𝐒 @ 𝐆 @ = 𝐖𝐌 @ D ( 6 ) The elements W ij of matrix W are either zero ( MC i and GC j not connected ) or take a positive value 𝑤 , which is the same for all connected pairs . Each GC connects to the same number k MC of MCs . Deviating from ( Chow et al . , 2012 ) where the circuit changed due to addition and removal of entire GCs , our model only replaces synapses . For simplicity , the new synapse connects to the same GC and a randomly chosen new MC . The possibility of accidentally connecting back to the same MC or any other synaptic partner of the GC to be replaced in the same time step is explicitly excluded . In the Poisson model replacement occurs entirely at random with a fixed probability p = 0 . 019 per synapse per time step , which was chosen to match the experimentally observed overall two - day survival rate of mature spines . In the Hebbian model each reciprocal synapse has a resilience value R ij attached to it , which is updated according to the Hebbian rule 𝑅 * ; 𝑡 + ∆𝑡 = 1 − 𝜆 K 𝑅 * ; 𝑡 + 𝜆 K 𝑀 * @ 𝐺 ; @ − 𝐺 NOP Q @ ( 7 ) where Δ t is the update interval , λ R is the resilience update rate , 𝐆 @ and 𝐌 @ are the firing rates in the steady state given by ( 6 ) , G min is a threshold , the subscript “ + ” indicates half - wave rectification and the sum is taken over all stimuli α in the odor environment . Thus , each synapse retains a memory of its resilience for a duration of the order Δ t / λ R . In each update step each synapse survives with a probability 1 2 + 1 2 tanh 𝛾 𝑅 * ; − 𝑅 , ( 8 ) where R 0 is the resilience threshold and γ its sharpness . Upon replacement , the synapse’s resilience memory is discarded and replaced with the new resilience calculated at the next update . Quasi - natural glomerular odor maps used as inputs Glomerular response maps obtained by imaging [ 14 C ] - 2 - deoxyglucose uptake were taken from the Glomerular Activity Response Archive http : / / gara . bio . uci . edu / ( Johnson and Leon , 2007 ) , downsampled to N MC pixels and normalized to lie between 1 and 2 . Most computer experiments used the odor set ( odor set 1 ) : D - limonene , L - limonene , isoamyl butyrate , methyl acetate , isopropylbenzene , cyclohexanone , acetone , ethyl butyrate , cycloheptane , 1 - propanol , propyl propionate , butyric acid . In Figure S7I this alternated with ( odor set 2 ) : octanal , nonanal , heptanal , amyl acetate , 1 - butanol , 1 - heptanol , hexanal , ethylbenzene , terepinen - 4 - ol ( - ) , eucalyptol , 1 - hexanol , 1 - octanol . Artificial inputs : Artificial input patterns were randomly drawn with replacement from the list of all pixel values of all 24 odor maps used . Synthetic circuit memory ( cf . Figure S7A ) Circuits with nontrivial input - output transform were generated using the following algorithm : 13 1 . Randomly draw without replacement N MC - 1 numbers between ( excl . ) 0 and N syn with N syn denoting the total number of synapses . Sort the vector , prepend 0 and append N syn and compute the differences of consecutive elements . If any of the differences exceeds N GC , discard the draw and start over . This difference vector v has approximately exponentially distributed entries . The rest of the algorithm attempted to randomly draw synapses such that ( 1 ) each GC connects to the same number of MCs and ( 2 ) the i - th MC connects to v i GCs . 2 Loop over the GCs : 3 For the current GC j consecutively draw its k MC synaptic partners in such a way that the probability of drawing MC i is proportional to v i minus the number of connections MC i has already accepted . If after the draw for GC j is complete this difference is larger than the number of remaining GCs for any MC , reject the draw and try step 3 again . Input fluctuations ( cf . Figure S7G , H ) Addition of new ORNs of any specificity was assumed to be a Poisson process with rate λ + . Any ORN at any time had a λ - = ( 62 . 5 day ) - 1 rate of spontaneously dying ( G . A . Graziadei and P . P . Graziadei , 1979 ) . One way of calculating the impulse response function for the number x ( t ) of ORNs present at time t 𝐺 𝑛 , 𝑚 , 𝜏 ≝ 𝑝 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝜏 = 𝑚 𝑥 𝑡 = 𝑛 ( 9 ) is to calculate first the conditional probability 𝐻 𝑛 , 𝑚 , 𝜏 ≝ 𝑝 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝜏 = 𝑚 𝑥 𝑡 = 0 ∧ 𝑁 𝑡 , 𝑡 + 𝜏 = 𝑛 ( 10 ) where N ( t , t + τ ) is the number of new ORNs created between times t and t + τ . The probability of such a new cell still being alive at time t + τ is 1 𝜏 𝑒 8 ^ _ ‘ d𝑡 b , = 1 𝜆 8 𝜏 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b ( 11 ) Since these are independent events we have 𝐻 𝑛 , 𝑚 , 𝜏 = 𝑛 𝑚 1 𝜆 8 𝜏 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b c 1 − 1 𝜆 8 𝜏 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b d8c ( 12 ) and 𝐺 0 , 𝑚 , 𝜏 = 𝑝 𝑁 𝑡 , 𝑡 + 𝜏 = 𝑚 + 𝑛 𝐻 𝑚 + 𝑛 , 𝑚 , 𝜏 e d + , = 𝑒 8 ^ f b 𝑚 ! 1 𝜆 8 𝜏 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b c 𝜆 Q 𝜏 cQd 𝑛 ! e d + , 1 − 1 𝜆 8 𝜏 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b d = 9 c ! ^ f ^ _ 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b c 𝑒 8 hfh _ 98i _ h _ j ( 13 ) Note the formal similarity of this last expression with the Poisson probability mass function . Finally , 14 𝐺 𝑛 , 𝑚 , 𝜏 = 𝑛 𝑘 𝑒 8 ^ _ bl 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b d8l 𝐺 0 , 𝑚 − 𝑘 , 𝜏 NOP d , c l + , ( 14 ) However , for the purpose of stochastic simulation , it is simpler to keep the two independent processes ( creation and survival of new cells versus death of pre - existing cells ) separate . Conditional on x ( t ) = n a random x ( t + τ ) with the correct distribution can be generated by summing an appropriate binomial random variable —representing the surviving preexisting cells—and a Poisson random variable —representing surviving new cells . Let µ ( n , τ ) and σ 2 ( n , τ ) be the mean and variance of x ( t + τ ) conditional on x ( t ) = n . Again , it is easiest to keep creation and survival of new cells on one hand , and survival of pre - existing cells on the other , separate . It is then readily verified that 𝜇 𝑛 , 𝜏 = 𝜆 Q 𝜆 8 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b + 𝑛𝑒 8 ^ _ b 𝜎 6 𝑛 , 𝜏 = 𝜆 Q 𝜆 8 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b + 𝑛𝑒 8 ^ _ b 1 − 𝑒 8 ^ _ b ( 15 ) Thus , the steady - state mean and variance 𝜇 e = 𝜎 e6 = 𝜆 Q 𝜆 8 ( 16 ) Assuming that on average 1 , 000 ORNs drive any MC produces λ + = 16 day - 1 ( G . A . Graziadei and P . P . Graziadei , 1979 ) . In our simulations , this process was approximated by an Ornstein - Uhlenbeck process 𝑑𝑥 ‘ = 𝜗 qr 𝑥 ‘ − 𝜇 qr 𝑑𝑡 + 𝜎 qr 𝑑𝑊 ‘ ( 17 ) ( W t is the Wiener process ) . To match steady - state variance and time evolution of the mean , its parameters were set at 𝜇 qr = 𝜇 e 𝜗 qr = 𝜆 8 𝜎 qr6 = 2 𝜆 86 𝜆 Q ( 18 ) Varying the Activity Dependence of Spine Survival ( cf . Figure S7J ) A series of models interpolating the age - dependence of spine survival rates between the data - matched Hebbian reference model and a Poisson model was generated by decreasing in small steps the sharpness γ of the survival threshold ( γ = 50 , 28 . 12 , 9 . 976 , 3 . 540 , 1 . 119 , 0 . 630 , 0 . 446 , 0 . 158 ; cf . eq . ( 8 ) ) . Keeping other parameters as in the reference model , 24 realizations of the network were generated at each point . Equilibrium was assumed and verified by visual inspection to have been reached within 4 , 000 time steps , and time averages were taken over a further 4 , 000 time steps . The age - dependence was quantified as log ( P ( 3days ) ) / log ( P ( 3hours ) ) - 1 , where P ( 3days ) and P ( 3hours ) are the probabilities of three - day - old synapses ( 24 time steps ) and three - hour - old synapses ( 1 time step ) , respectively , to survive 1 time step . To assess the sampling variability we used bootstrapping , averaging 24 randomly picked ( with replacement ) lifetime distributions from the 24 simulations and similarly for the pattern correlation . Uniqueness of fixed point A convenient way to see that the system ( 5 ) converges to its unique fixed point , is to use the Lyapunov function L given in Seung et al . ( Seung et al . , 1998 ) with the saddle 15 parameter set at r = 0 . This Lyapunov function is readily seen to be bounded below and— once a misprint in their equation ( 10 ) , which should instead read min v , w 𝑎 − 𝑏 𝐂 𝑎 − 𝑏 D 𝑎 − 𝑏 𝑔 89 𝑎 − 𝑔 89 𝑏 D ≥ −1 + 𝑟𝜏 ~ ( 19 ) was corrected—to be strictly decreasing outside the fixed point .
