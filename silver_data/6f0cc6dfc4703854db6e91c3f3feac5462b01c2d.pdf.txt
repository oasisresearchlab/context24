There is a growing commitment within cognitive psy - chology to understand the mind in the context of its ties to a physical body , championing the notion that the mind uses the body to accomplish cognitive goals , not only through direct action but also by tapping into perceptual and motor resources to represent and manipulate information ( e . g . , Barsalou , 1999 ; Glenberg , 1997 ; Wilson , 2002 ; Zwaan , 1999 ) . These theories of embodied cognition suggest that cognitive processes are rooted in the body’s interactions with the physical world ; knowledge representation in the brain maintains properties of the sensorimotor states that give rise to it . Accumulating evidence shows that men - tal simulations , situated action , and bodily states underlie thought processes in perception , language comprehen - sion , memory , social cognition , and conceptual process - ing ( for a review , see Barsalou , 2008 ) . Although a wide variety of evidence points to strong interactions between the mind and the body , much of the research emphasis within embodied cognition has been tied to the notion that knowledge representations are based on body - bound mental simulations , essentially backing the claim that people use their bodies to think ( e . g . , Hegarty , 2004 ; Martin , 2007 ; Rubin , 2006 ) . However , relatively little work has directly examined whether cognitive processes can arise from the manner in which our bodies interact with the immediate environment or whether it is possible to guide a person’s thoughts by manipulating his or her actions . Are interactions between the mind and body bidirectional ? The mind uses the body to accomplish cognitive goals , but can we make the body move in ways that guide the mind ? Research from the social psychology literature suggests that body movements may indeed play a causal role in cognitive processing , showing that experimental manipu - lations of actions and bodily states produce changes in affect . People are more likely to agree with statements that they hear if they nod while listening ( e . g . , Wells & Petty , 1980 ) , to rate a cartoon as more humorous if—outside of their explicit awareness—their smiling musculature is facilitated as they view the cartoon ( Strack , Martin , & Stepper , 1988 ) , and to feel more pride in an achievement when directed to sit in an upright rather than slumped po - sition when receiving news about performance ( Stepper & Strack , 1993 ) . Moreover , actions with which people have extensive experience outside of laboratory manipulations can influence likeability judgments ; for instance , people will find a random pair of letters more likeable if they have extensive typing experience and the letter pair is easy to type ( Beilock & Holt , 2007 ) . Some investigators have begun to examine how actions may also influence higher order cognition . Cook , Mitchell , and Goldin - Meadow ( 2008 ) found that children who were required to gesture while undergoing instruction on a new mathematical concept were more likely to retain the knowl - edge that they gained during instruction . Glenberg , Sato , and Cattaneo ( 2008 ) showed that participants’ compre - hension of both concrete and abstract language involving transfer was altered following 20 min of a repetitive transfer motor task . Thomas and Lleras ( 2007 ) demonstrated that by directing participants to move their eyes in a particular pat - tern , they could increase the participants’ chances of solving 719 © 2009 The Psychonomic Society , Inc . Swinging into thought : Directed movement guides insight in problem solving L aura E .

We investigated how move - ment interventions affected participants’ ability to solve a classic insight problem . The participants attempted to solve Maier’s two - string problem while occasionally taking exercise breaks during which they moved their arms either in a manner related to the problem’s solution ( swing group ) or in a manner inconsistent with the solution ( stretch group ) . Although most of the participants were unaware of the relationship between their arm move - ment exercises and the problem - solving task , the participants who moved their arms in a manner that suggested the problem’s solution were more likely to solve the problem than were those who moved their arms in other ways . Consistent with embodied theories of cognition , these findings show that actions influence thought and , furthermore , that we can implicitly guide people toward insight by directing their actions .

Thomas , laura . e . thomas @ vanderbilt . edu 720 T homas and L Leras to solve this problem is to attach an object to one of the strings and use this object as a weight to make the string swing like a pendulum . Once one string is swinging , the participants can then walk to the stationary string , grasp it , and finally catch the moving string in its upswing . To investigate how directed movements affect thought processes related to the two - string problem , we told the participants a cover story : that we were interested in how exercise breaks and blood oxygenation levels would influ - ence their ability to solve the problem . We reasoned that if actions can guide cognitive processing , the participants directed to swing their arms during exercise ( a movement consistent with the string motion necessary to solve the problem ) should be more successful in solving the two - string problem than the participants directed to stretch their arms during exercise ( a movement inconsistent with the problem’s solution ) . METhoD Participants Fifty - two 2 University of Illinois students who were unfamiliar with the two - string problem participated for course credit . Procedure The problem space in which the participants worked is pictured in Figures 1A and 1B . We asked the participants to tie the two strings together using only the objects provided on the table . The partici - pants were not allowed to touch the strings with their legs or feet , to change the position of the strings on the wooden board to which they were attached , or to use the wooden board in any other way . Following instruction on the two - string problem , the experimenter explained the cover story , telling the participants that we were inter - ested in the influence of exercise breaks on problem - solving perfor - mance . The experimenter then silently demonstrated the movement that the participants were to perform during these exercise breaks . The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups that differed in the type of motion their exercise required . The participants in the swing group extended their arms and swung them back and forth ( see Figure 1A ) , whereas the participants in the stretch group alternated extending their arms straight out to either side in a stretching motion ( see Figure 1B ) . The experimenter told the participants that whenever they heard an alarm noise , they should move to an indicated position and begin performing the assigned movement until they heard a second alarm noise , at which time they were free to continue trying to solve the two - string problem until the next exercise break period . In addi - tion , to prevent the participants from making any overt connections between directed movements and the problem - solving task , during the exercise periods , the participants also had to count backward by threes , aloud , beginning at a random number between 100 and 999 that the experimenter read at the start of each break period . The experiment was divided into eight 2 - min attempt intervals , with each interval consisting of a 20 - sec exercise period and a 100 - sec problem - solving period , during which the participants were free to move around the problem space , interact with the objects , and attempt solutions . 3 If a participant tied the two strings together , he or she was scored as successful , the attempt number at which he or she solved the problem was recorded , and the experiment was con - cluded . The participants who were unable to tie the strings together after eight attempts ( 16 min ) were scored as unsuccessful . All per - formances were recorded on a Panasonic 3CCD digital camcorder . Following the end of the experiment , the participants completed a short posttest questionnaire . This questionnaire asked , “Did you see any relationship between the problem solving task and the exercise you performed ? If yes , what was the relationship ? ” a tricky problem . The same effect is also true with directed movements of covert attention ( Thomas & Lleras , 2009 ) . These findings hint at a causal link between action and cognition , but it is still unclear whether directed move - ments of the body can—outside of the participants’ con - scious awareness—guide higher order cognitive process - ing . We investigated the relationship between action and thought by asking participants to work their way through a classic insight problem 1 while occasionally interrupting them with a seemingly unrelated exercise task . We evalu - ated whether the pattern of movement that the participants engaged in during exercise influenced their subsequent reasoning about how to solve the problem . The Problem The participants attempted to solve a variant of Maier’s ( 1931 ) two - string problem pictured in Figures 1A and 1B . We asked the participants to find a way to tie two strings hanging from opposite ends of the room together using only their arms and the objects provided on a side table : a wrench , a paperback book , two small dumbbells , and a plate . Although the strings were long enough to be tied to - gether , they were too short for the participants to be able to grasp the end of one string , walk to the opposite side of the room , and reach the other string . The most efficient way Figure 1 . The two - string problem . ( A ) Swing condition . ( B ) Stretch condition . A B e mbodied P robLem s oLving 721 in a pattern consistent with the two - string problem’s so - lution were more likely to eventually solve the problem than were the participants who had to stretch their arms in a pattern that was not related to the problem’s solution . The participants in the swing group tended to engage in behaviors that led them to more rapidly solve the two - string problem , frequently attaching an object to a string and setting it swinging after only a few repetitions of the arm - swinging exercise . The participants in the stretch group , however , were more likely to try unsuccessful methods of tying the strings together , often attempting to stretch and grab the second string while holding the first ( to watch videos of the participants attempting to solve the problem , visit www . psych . uiuc . edu / ~ alleras / videos . htm ) . Furthermore , even though directed body movements had a significant impact on the participants’ ultimate success or failure with the two - string problem , almost all of our participants reported being unaware of any relationship between how they moved their arms during exercise and how they went about trying to solve the problem . To the extent that our posttest questionnaire accurately captured how the participants perceived the relationship between their directed arm movements and the two - string prob - lem , our results suggest that actions did implicitly guide thoughts . The participants did not consciously perceive their swinging arm movements as overt hints about how to solve the two - string problem , presumably because the backward counting task that they engaged in during exercise tied up cognitive resources , preventing them from making explicit connections between their movements and the problem - solving task . This backward - counting task also likely prevented verbal rehearsal of words such as swing or stretch during exercise . However , we also replicated the results of this study in a second experiment , in which the participants did not have to count backward during exercise break periods . Under these conditions , the par - ticipants who swung their arms ( 78 % success rate ) were also significantly more likely to solve the two - string prob - lem than were the participants who stretched their arms ( 50 % success rate ) [ χ 2 ( 1 , 36 ) 5 4 . 55 , p 5 . 033 ] , suggest - ing that actions influence thoughts regardless of the extent to which we attempt to make this influence implicit . One question that arises from this research is whether the difference in performance between the swing and stretch groups was a result of the swinging movements facilitat - ing thoughts about swinging the strings or of the stretching movements interfering with thoughts about swinging the strings . To address this question , we ran 18 participants in a separate control condition in which they were not asked to move during the break periods , nor to count backward : They were simply asked to stand still with their arms at their sides during those breaks . This group solved the two - string problem 72 % of the time . Although this result may not be directly comparable with the main experimental conditions described here , the fact that these participants’ performance fell in between the performances of the swing group ( 85 % ) and the stretch group ( 62 % ) suggests facilita - tion and interference driven specifically by our swinging and stretching movement interventions , respectively . RESuLTS We were interested in whether the arm movements that the participants made during their exercise break periods influenced their chances of successfully solving the two - string problem . Figure 2 shows the proportion of the partici - pants in each group to successfully solve the problem after each attempt interval . By the end of the 16 - min deadline , 85 % of the participants in the swing group had successfully solved the problem , whereas only 62 % of the participants in the stretch group were successful . A log - rank survival analysis test ( see Cleves , Gould , & Gutierrez , 2002 , for de - tails ) comparing the solution rates for the two groups across the eight 2 - min intervals suggested that these rates were significantly different [ χ 2 ( 1 , 52 ) 5 3 . 95 , p 5 . 047 ] . In addition to demonstrating a causal link between di - rected action and cognitive processing , we also wanted to determine the extent to which this link is implicit . A check of the posttest questionnaires that the participants completed suggested that , as they were performing the task , only 3 participants suspected a relationship between their movements during exercise and the solution to the insight problem ; 2 participants in the swing group and 1 participant in the stretch group wrote that they did see a relationship between their exercise and the problem’s so - lution and then elaborated that they realized as they were trying to solve the problem that their directed arm move - ments were a hint about the solution . We reran the log - rank survival analysis after excluding data from these 3 participants and found that the solution rates between the swing and stretch groups remained significantly different [ χ 2 ( 1 , 49 ) 5 4 . 30 , p 5 . 038 ] .

Our results suggest that by getting a person to move , his or her threshold for experiencing thoughts that share something in common with the movement is lowered , but how is this possible ? The interaction between body and mind may arise from the spatial compatibility that exists between different areas of the brain involved in representing spatial infor - mation ( e . g . , see Driver & Spence , 2004 , for multimodal compatibility , and Hommel , Müsseler , Aschersleben , & Prinz , 2001 , for perception – action compatibility ) . If we scale up from simple demonstrated cases of spatial compatibility—such as the fact that tactile stimulation on the same side as a visual target enhances activity in the visual cortex ( Macaluso , Frith , & Driver , 2000 ) —to more sophisticated interactions—such as activation of a swing - ing arm motion in the motor - control areas of the brain enhancing activity of representations of compatible object motion in other parts of the brain—we can see how certain actions may facilitate certain thoughts . The spatial repre - sentations used to direct a person’s movements in space might be more active in motor - control areas of the brain , but because these representations are active , the person might be facilitated in representing compatible actions or locations in space in other parts of the brain . In the case of the two - string problem , preparing a swinging motion activates other swinging representations . Alternatively , we can also conceptualize these com - patibilities as interactions within the spatial module of working memory ( e . g . , Baddeley & Hitch , 1974 ; Klauer & Zhao , 2004 ; Logie , 1995 ) . That is , if we assume that spatial working memory is invested both in the planning of movements and in reasoning about problems that are inherently spatial ( as the two - string problem is ) , one can easily imagine that residual activation of location and ac - tion plans that a person uses to execute movements might interact with the spatial representations he or she uses to think about the spatial problem . Although the participants are consciously aware of the directed movements that they execute and the spatial representations of the two - string problem space , they do not necessarily have to be aware of the manner in which the former shape the latter . The contents of working memory are conscious , but the route by which they enter working memory need not be . In other words , participants need not necessarily be aware of re - sidual activations relating to the exercise task , yet these activations could impact how ( or which ) spatial represen - tations the participants use to attempt to solve the prob - lem : Residual activation of the swinging arm action may make the participants working on the two - string problem more likely to include swinging motion of the strings in their spatial representation of that problem space . concLuSion By directing participants’ arm movements , we were able to substantially affect their chances of successfully solving a demanding insight problem , demonstrating that specific movement interventions can implicitly guide higher order cognitive processing . This finding suggests that directed Our results expand on a growing literature on embod - ied cognition in several interesting ways , demonstrating that embodiment goes beyond the mind’s use of the body in accomplishing cognitive work ( e . g . , Barsalou , 2008 ; Wilson 2002 ) . First , we showed that body movements can actually lead participants toward complex higher order thoughts that they would have been less likely to arrive at otherwise . Second , this effect occurs irrespec - tive of whether the participants ever become aware of a relationship between the body movements and the prob - lem at hand . And third , this effect takes place when we , the experimenters , are the ones asking the participants to move in specific ways ; that is , we can literally change people’s minds by asking them or leading them to move in a particular way . Although previous studies of insight problem solving have shown that some participants unconsciously capital - ize on hints to solve a problem , such as in Maier’s ( 1931 ) original study , in which participants were more likely to produce the target solution after seeing the experimenter bump into a string to set it swinging , we believe the influ - ence of a participant’s actions on his or her thoughts in our experiment stands apart from these findings . In Mai - er’s study , only the subset of the participants who tried and failed to produce the target solution to the two - string problem then saw the experimenter bump into a string . Of these participants , 62 % eventually produced the tar - get solution , in some cases only after viewing multiple string bumps and after being handed a pair of pliers and explicitly instructed that this item alone was sufficient to solve the problem . Because no baseline condition was measured ( i . e . , a no - hint group ) , interpretation of this “improvement” in success rate is difficult : It may have simply resulted from the overall longer exposure to the problem itself . In fact , in a more recent exploration of the two - string problem , the success rates of the participants who saw an experimenter bump into a string and set it swinging were not significantly different from those of a control group who did not receive any hints ( Landrum , 1990 ) . Even though these participants actually viewed the object that needed to move ( the string ) moving in the ap - propriate manner ( swinging ) , only an average of 55 % of them solved the problem—a solution rate quite smaller than the ones we obtained in our swing groups . In other words , although it is possible that some sort of activation of the swinging concept may have been triggered in those studies , either by viewing the experimenter bump a string or by seeing the string itself swing , it seems that the ac - tion component in our experiments is substantially more potent in implicitly guiding thought than are those indirect hints . Furthermore , it is generally found that participants show weak or null effects of spontaneously transferring solution - related information from analogous problems to a new problem ; participants often need explicit instruc - tions in order to apply conceptual information from one instance to another ( e . g . , Gick & Holyoak , 1980 , 1983 ; Reed , Ernst , & Banerji , 1974 ) . In contrast , the embodied effects that we observed here were both strong and im - plicit , suggesting that actions influenced problem solving in a different way than did those indirect hints . e mbodied P robLem s oLving 723 Maier , N .

Insight problems are characterized by the fact that solutions seem - ing most obvious to naive problem solvers do not work , that problem solvers working on them cannot accurately track their own performance , and that problem solvers must often overcome an impasse in their rea - soning in order to infer the problem’s solution ( Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ; Weisberg & Alba , 1981 ) . 2 . Ten additional participants were excluded from the analysis for pro - ducing nonstandard solutions to the problem ( such as lengthening one of the strings or pulling in a string with an object ) . Four belonged to the swing group , 6 to the stretch group . 3 . The intermittent nature of the exercise breaks leaves open the pos - sibility that the participants experienced an incubation benefit ( e . g . , Smith & Blankenship , 1991 ) ; that is , exercise breaks of either type may have helped the participants to let go of unsuccessful problem - solving strategies , clearing the way for them to potentially embrace the correct strategy in the next interval . However , since both the swing and stretch groups took exercise breaks at the same times and for the same durations , there is no reason to believe that such incubation effects would lead to differences in performance between the two groups . ( Manuscript received August 18 , 2008 ; revision accepted for publication March 16 , 2009 . ) actions may be a powerful tool , not only in teaching us about the influence of movements on cognitive processes , but also as a potential intervention in learning situations ( e . g . , Cook et al . , 2008 ) . Our work also raises the possi - bility that self - generated actions could be instrumental in arriving at insights in a number of different domains of thought , such as scientific and creative thinking , and opens a new window into the unique nature of human cognition .
