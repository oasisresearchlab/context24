An elastic bond connecting points M ( k ) and M ( l ) on neighboring subunits k and l , respectively will experience extension ( or retraction ) due to changes in the relative subunit orientation and / or position ( Figure S3 ) . The total elastic free energy ( F elastic ) stored in the j th bond extension / retraction is given by : ( ) 2 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( ; 0 ) ( ; 0 ) 2 elastic j j j j j S F k l k l k l = − M M M M ( S1 ) . The points M ( k ) j or M ( l ) j ( resp . M ( k ; 0 ) j or M ( l ; 0 ) j ) represent the attachment points of the j th bond on subunits k and l in an arbitrary configuration ( other than the resting , denoted by 0 , configuration ) ; S is the bond stiffness ; j j l k ) ( ) ( M M ( resp . j j l k ) 0 ; ( ) 0 ; ( M M ) is the length of the j th bond in an arbitrary subunit configuration ( resp . at rest ) . The resulting elementary elastic force is proportional to the bond stiffness ( S ) and change in bond length ( ( ) ) 0 ; ( ) 0 ; ( ) ( ) ( l k l k M M M M − ) . The force resulting from bond extension or retraction is along a line through points M ( k ) and M ( l ) as : ( ) ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 ; ( ) 0 ; ( ) ( ) ( ) , ( l k l k l k l k S l k M M M M M M M M F − − = ( S2 ) . Summation of all elementary forces exerted on the interface bonds between subunit k and l yields the sum of elastic force ( F ) experienced by the k th subunit ( term in the rhs of Eq . 2 in main text ) . The balance of torques ( Eq . 3 , main text ) and the kinematic condition ( Eq . 4 , main text ) provide the equations for the Euler angles ( θ ( k ) , φ ( k ) , ψ ( k ) ) associated with vectors ( d ( k ) 1 , d ( k ) 2 , d ( k ) 3 ) : 3 ( ) ( ) ( k ) Ω ( k ) ( k ) Ω ( k ) θ ( k ) dt ( k ) d ( k ) Ω ( k ) ( k ) Ω ( k ) θ ( k ) Ω ( k ) dt ( k ) d ( k ) Ω ( k ) ( k ) Ω ( k ) dt k d φ φ ψ φ φ φ φ φ θ cos sin sin 1 cos sin cot sin cos ) ( 2 1 2 1 3 2 1 − = + − + = + = ( S3 ) , where ( Ω ( k ) 1 , Ω ( k ) 2 , Ω ( k ) 3 ) are the three - dimensional components of the angular velocity Ω ( k ) expressed in the standard vector basis in R 3 [ 1 , 2 ] . The equations for filament subunit displacement ( Eqs . 2 - 4 , main text ) determine the magnitude of displacement resulting from external forces ( Eq . S2 ) . Substitution of the angular velocity of subunit k ( Ω ( k ) ; Eq . 3 in main text ) into Eq . S3 permits calculation of the time evolution of the Euler angles ( θ ( k ) , φ ( k ) , ψ ( k ) ) , and , consequently , the evolution of ( d ( k ) 1 , d ( k ) 2 , d ( k ) 3 ) associated with subunit k . The Matlab function ode15s was used to simulate subunit displacement and filament deformation under applied external loads ( Figure 2 , main text ) . B . Analysis of the filament elastic free energy . We provide in the following section derivations for the total free elastic energy stored in model filament configurations under various orientation constraints and show that they are formally equivalent to the Kirchhoff elastic free energy expression used in classical continuum model approaches . These expressions directly yield the filament bending , torsional , and twist - bend coupling persistence lengths , and were used to generate the three - dimensional bond stiffness - subunit interface area - persistence length phase diagrams ( Figure 3 , main text ) . To determine how the mesoscopic mechanical properties of actin filaments are rooted in the geometric organization of bonds , we first consider the free elastic energy stored in the extension ( or retraction ) of individual subunit interface bond ( Eq . S1 and Figure S3 ) . The 4 analysis presented forthcoming is limited to orientation changes that do not alter the subunit center of mass position ( defined by points G ( k ) and G ( l ) ; Figure S3 ) . The following sections are organized as follows . We first derive the change in attachment point positions of a single ( i . e . j th ) bond ( Eq . S15 , section B1 forthcoming ) when subunits are rotated from the resting to an arbitrary configuration ( Figure S3 , Panel A ) , then using Eq . S15 subsequently derive the elastic free energy associated with extension of this bond ( Eq . S24 section B2 forthcoming ) . We then use Eq . S24 to express the total elastic free energy of the different filament models considered in this study under load and deformation ( section C forthcoming ) . B1 . Bond attachment and displacement with subunit rotation . The attachment point positions of the j th bond in the resting configuration is ) 0 ; ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 ; ( ) 0 ; ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 ; ( 3 1 , 3 1 , l l a l l k k a k k i i i j j i i i j j d G M d G M ∑ ∑ = = + = + = ( S4 ) , where the scalars a ( k ) j , i and a ( l ) j , i , i = 1 , 2 or 3 , are , respectively , the components of bond attachments points M ( k ) j and M ( l ) j expressed in their respective local vector basis ( d ( k ; 0 ) 1 , d ( k ; 0 ) 2 , d ( k ; 0 ) 3 ) and ( d ( l ; 0 ) 1 , d ( l ; 0 ) 2 , d ( l ; 0 ) 3 ) ; the indexes k or l refers to the subunit number . Note that the a ( k ) j or a ( l ) j are fixed quantities independent of the spatial subunit orientation . We introduce two matrices , R ( k ; 0 ) and R ( l ; 0 ) , whose columns are given by vector quantities ( d ( k ; 0 ) 1 , d ( k ; 0 ) 2 , d ( k ; 0 ) 3 ) or ( d ( l ; 0 ) 1 , d ( l ; 0 ) 2 , d ( l ; 0 ) 3 ) , respectively . Matrices R ( k ; 0 ) ( resp . R ( l ; 0 ) ) are orthogonal so that their inverse is given by their transpose matrix 3 3 0 ) 0 ( ; ) 0 ( ) 0 ( I R R I R R = = ) ( l , l , k , k , T T ( S5 ) , where I 3 is the identity matrix . Note that it is equivalent to define the orientation of a subunit either by the set of the three vectors ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ) or its associated matrix R . 5 To simplify the mathematical discussion , we introduce as the reference point the mid - point between subunits k and l : ( ) ) ( ) ( 2 1 l k G G G + = ( S6 ) , to which we assign a system of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors ( ) ) 0 ( ) , 0 ( ) , 0 ( 3 2 1 d d d . An “average” rotation , denoted ) 0 ( R whose columns are given by the three vectors ( ) ) 0 ( ) , 0 ( ) , 0 ( 3 2 1 d d d is computed as the solution of two simultaneous matrix equations : A R R A R R ) 0 ( ) 0 , ( , ) 0 ( ) 0 , ( = = l k T ( S7 ) , where A is an unknown ( orthogonal ) matrix obeying T l k A R A R ) 0 ; ( ) 0 ; ( = ( S8 ) . Matrix A is solved by taking the square root of the product ( ; 0 ) ( ; 0 ) T k l ⋅ R R . Once A is obtained , the “average” rotation is expressed as : T l k A R A R R ) 0 ; ( ) 0 ; ( ) 0 ( = = ( S9 ) , and Eq . S4 becomes j j j T j l l l k k k ) ( ) 0 ( ) ( ) 0 ; ( ) ( ) 0 ( ) ( ) 0 ; ( Aa R G M a A R G M + = + = ( S10 ) . All perturbations imposed to subunits k and l are expressed with respect to the local vector basis given by the “averaged” orthogonal matrix ) 0 ( R associated with the mid - point G . We impose an arbitrary rotation to subunits k and l ( about the mid - point G ) and compute the resulting bond end displacements . Since only the relative motion of subunits is relevant , we consider a single perturbation denoted K , expressed in the local vector basis associated with ) 0 ( R , so that the rotations applied to subunits k or l are , respectively : ( ) ( ) A R KK K I R A R KK K I R ) 0 ( ) cos ( 1 ( ) sin ( ) ( ) 0 ( ) cos ( 1 ( ) sin ( ) ( ε ε ε ε − + + = − + − = l k T ( S11 ) . 6 where K is represented by a skew symmetric matrix ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝⎛− − − = 0 ) , ( ) , ( ) , ( 0 ) , ( ) , ( ) , ( 0 1 2 1 3 2 3 κ κ κ κ κ κ K l k l k l k l k l k l k κ κ κ κ κ κ ( S12 ) .

It is assumed that the rotation amplitude ( ε ) is small relative to subunit dimensions . Therefore , we limited the expansion to order ( ε ) only to avoid extra ( quartic ) terms in the free elastic energy function .

The term 2 ) ( ) ( ) , ( l k l k SN G G is the total bond stiffness ( SN ( k , l ) , where N ( k , l ) is the total number of elementary bonds distributed over a subunit k , l interface ) times the square of the distance between the two subunit centers of mass and represents the total interface elastic energy . The term ρ 2 is the square of the bond dispersion radius and accounts for the interface area , which in the case of a disc is approximated by 2 ) , ( πρ = l k Area . The value of ρ∼0 when bond attachment points are concentrated in an infinitely small area such that the radial dispersion approaches zero . We note that the mesoscopic model presented in this study accurately predicts an energy change of zero under these conditions . The matrix ( ) ) , ( ) , ( 3 l k l k u u I ⊗ − corresponds to the projection on a plane orthogonal to the bond unit vector u ( k , l ) . The axial vector κ has dimensions of radian . m - 1 and its components represent the rotation strains imposed on subunits k and l . Transformation allows for the different parameters of interest to be expressed as the elastic free energy function ( Eq . S24 ) .

S24 ) of the mesoscopic filament models can be expressed in the form of the Kirchhoff elastic free energy equation used in the ( continuum ) theory of elastic rods [ 2 , 3 ] : ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 1 1 3 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 3 2 3 2 3 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 ( ) ( ) ( ) elastic w F k l u u u u u u w u u u u u u κ κ κ κκ κκ κκ = + + + + + − + + ( S28 ) . Parameters of interest are the flexural ( bending ) rigidities ( ) ( 23 22 u u w + or ) ( 23 21 u u w + ) , torsional ( twisting ) rigidity ( ) ( 22 21 u u w + ) , and the coupling between twisting and bending ( ) ( ) ( 3 2 3 1 u u w u u w + ) . The advantage of the elastic free energy function derived in this work ( Eq . S24 ) over the more familiar Kirchhoff equation used in continuum mechanics is that all parameters are derived from microscopic filament structural properties , including the subunit dimensions , filament geometry ( e . g . helicity , number of strands , and staggered versus aligned double strands ) , the number and type ( e . g . lateral , diagonal , longitudinal ) of subunit interface bonds , as well as the intersubunit bond area . C . Elastic free energy of the different filament models considered in this study Eq . S24 is a general form of the elastic free energy stored in the configuration of the linear polymers described in this study . The expression can be simplified depending on the specific microscopic filament properties . In the following section , we derive these simplified expressions for the four filament types evaluated in this study . C1 . Single stranded , non helical filament . Without loss of generality , we assume that the long axes of filament subunits are arranged in a parallel manner such that the three vectors u ( k , l ) , d 3 ( k ) and d 3 ( l ) are aligned in a fixed vertical direction e 3 : 11 3 3 3 ) ( ) ( ) , ( e d d u = = = l k l k ( S29 ) . Under these conditions , Eq . S28 can be approximated by : ( ) 2 2 1 2 ( , ) 2 elastic w F k l κ κ = + ( S30 ) , indicating that the elastic free energy is dominated by bending ( i . e . no twisting or twist - bend coupling ) . Therefore , the mechanical properties of the single stranded , non helical filaments evaluated in this study are governed by isotropic bending rigidities . We stress that this does not mean that single - stranded non - helical filaments do not possess an elastic torsional component ( i . e . torsional rigidity ) , but that the bending stiffness is considerably larger than that of twisting and therefore dominates the overall mechanics . C2 . Single stranded , helical filament . The center of mass positions of subunits in a single stranded , helical filament correspond to those of a helix with rise b and arclength ( i . e . contour length ) s wrapping with frequency , ω , around a cylinder of radius r such that : ( ) ( ) s r s z s r s y bs s x ω ω sin ) ( cos ) ( ) ( = = = ( S31 ) . A helix that maintains radial contact with the cylinder ( i . e . helical filament with constant width ) satisfies the condition : 2 2 2 1 b r ω + = ( S32 ) . Therefore , the vector quantities ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ) are given by derivation of the x , y , and z point positions ( S30 ) as follows : ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 3 1 2 0 sin , cos , sin cos sin cos b r r s s b s r s s b s ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω − ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ = − = = − ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ d d d ( S33 ) . 12 If subunit k and l centers of mass are located at positions s = s 1 and s = s 2 along the helix , respectively , the bond vector u ( k , l ) can be expressed using the ( ) 3 2 1 , , d d d vectors at mid - point position ) s ( s s 2 1 12 2 1 + = : ( ) ( ) ) ( ) ( ) ( 1 ) , ( 6 12 2 4 3 2 2 12 3 4 1 δ δα δ α δα O s s l k + + + + = d d u ( S34 ) , with ( ) 5760 7 3 , 24 , 1152 , 2 2 2 5 3 2 2 3 1 1 2 ω ω α ω α ω α δ r b rb rb rb s s + = − = = − = ( S35 ) . Tedious manipulation yields the matrix ( ) ) , ( ) , ( l k l k u u I ⊗ − : ) 6 ( 4 1 2 4 3 2 2 0 4 3 2 2 4 2 1 0 0 0 1 δ δα δ α δ α δ α δ α δ α O + ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝⎛ − − − − − ( S36 ) , from which the equation for total elastic free energy change can be obtained : ( ) ( ) ( ) 3 1 4 3 2 2 23 4 1 22 4 2 21 2 1 2 ) , ( κκ δα δα κ δα κ δα κ + − + − + = w l k F elastic ( S37 ) . Therefore , in addition to isotropic flexural rigidities ( proportional to first two terms in rhs parentheses ) , single stranded helical filaments possess an intrinsic torsional rigidity ( proportional to third term in rhs parentheses ) and twist - bend coupling ( proportional to fourth term in rhs parentheses ) . However , the magnitude of these rigidity parameters scales with the arclength distance ( δ ) along the helix connecting the subunit centers . Consequently , the twist - bend coupling ( ~ δ 2 ) of single - stranded helical filaments is weaker than their bending rigidity ( ~ 1 ) , but stronger than torsional rigidity ( ~ δ 4 ) , as illustrated in Figure 3 , ( panel B , main text ) . C3 . Double stranded , helical , aligned and staggered filaments . We now apply equations ( S19 and S24 ) to the case of double stranded filament organization by modifying the reference point position ( Eq . S6 ) and the “average” rotation 13 ( Eqs . S7 - S9 ) . We consider four consecutive subunits in a double stranded filament , denoted k 1 - 2 and l 1 - 2 and their average center position , G ( Figure S4 ) . For each subunit pair k 1 - 2 and l 1 - 2 , the two associated “average” matrices ( see Eqs . S7 - 9 ) are computed from : , ) 0 ; , ( ) 0 , ( , ) 0 ; , ( ) 0 , ( , ) 0 ; , ( ) 0 , ( , ) 0 ; , ( ) 0 , ( 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 B R R B R R A R R A R R l l l l l l k k k k k k T T = = = = ( S38 ) , with ( ) ( ) ) 0 , ( ) 0 , ( , ) 0 , ( ) 0 , ( 21 2 1 21 2 1 l l k k T T R R B R R A = = ( S39 ) and 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ( , ; 0 ) ( ; 0 ) ( ; 0 ) , ( , ; 0 ) ( ; 0 ) ( ; 0 ) T T k k k k l l l l = = = = R R A R A R R B R B ( S40 ) . Note that matrices R ( k 1 , k 2 ; 0 ) and R ( l 1 , l 2 ; 0 ) refer to the positions G ( k 1 , k 2 ) and G ( l 1 , l 2 ) ( Figure S4 ) . The averaging procedure is repeated and the “average” rotation ) 0 ( R associated with the central position G ( Figure S4 ) is obtained from the following equations : , ) 0 ( ) 0 ; , ( , ) 0 ( ) 0 ; , ( 2 1 2 1 C R R C R R = = l l k k T ( S41 ) with ( ) 12 1 2 1 2 ( , ; 0 ) ( , ; 0 ) T C k k l l = R R ( S42 ) and T l l k k C R C R R ) 0 ; , ( ) 0 ; , ( ) 0 ( 2 1 2 1 = = ( S43 ) . The matrix ) 0 ( R provides a set of vector basis ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ) associated with the central point G ( Figure S4 ) . Using relations ( S38 - 43 ) , the original rotations can be expressed as : , ) 0 ( ) 0 , ( , ) 0 ( ) 0 , ( , ) 0 ( ) 0 , ( , ) 0 ( ) 0 , ( 2 1 2 1 CB R R CB R R A C R R A C R R = = = = l l k k T T T T ( S44 ) or , after perturbation ( see Eq .

S12 . We compute the total elastic free energy by applying arbitrary rotations to alter the position of a bond attachment point ( Eq . S13 ) from : ) ( ) 0 ( ) 0 ; ( x x Xa R G M + = ( S46 ) , where x stands for any subunit number ( e . g . k 1 , k 2 , l 1 , or l 2 ) and X corresponds to any of the following matrices : , , , T T T T C A C A CB CB ( S47 ) . After perturbation , the same bond attachment point has moved to a new position , M ( x ) : ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ) 0 ; ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 ; ( ) ( ) 0 ( ) ( x x x x x x M G GG K I G GM K I G Xa R K I G M + ± + = ± + = ± + = ε ε ε ( S48 ) . Eq . S48 is equivalent to Eq . S13 or S14 with a notable difference arising from contribution of the distance GG ( x ) between the averaged position G center of subunits k 1 , k 2 , l 1 , or l 2 . These terms are absent from Eq . S13 and S14 and are responsible for distinct mechanical properties of the filaments that emerge with the double - stranded structure .

Classic theory of elastic rods . Schematic representation of a continuous elastic rod ( solid black line ) , the local vector basis ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ) associated with a specific point on the filament and the standard basis vector in R 3 ( e 1 , e 2 , e 3 ) . Vectors ( d 1 , d 2 ) span the plane orthogonal to the rod whereas d 3 is the tangent vector to the rod direction . Figure S2 . In - and out - of - plane filament buckling under load . A constant load applied to the filament ends yields in - plane or out - of - plane buckling depending on the existence of twist - bend coupling . Figure S3 . Elastic free energy associated with bond extension . Panel A Arbitrary rotations R ( k ) ( resp . R ( l ) ) applied to subunit k ( resp . l ) move the bond end position M ( k ; 0 ) ( resp . M ( l ; 0 ) ) to a new position M ( k ) ( resp . M ( l ) ) . The elastic free energy stored in the bond extension / retraction is a complex function of the rotation angles ( coded by rotations R ( k ) and R ( l ) ) and the microscopic filament architecture . Panel B . Projection of G ( k ) M ( k ; 0 ) j and G ( l ) M ( l ; 0 ) j , respectively , either on the line connecting subunits centers ( points M ( k ; 1 ) and M ( l ; 1 ) , indicated by large black dots ) or on the plane orthogonal to the bond vector ( points M ( k ; 2 ) and M ( l ; 2 ) , indicated by large black dots ) ; φ is the angle between the projected bond vector G ( k ) M ( k ; 2 ) and d 1 ( k ) or G ( l ) M ( l ; 2 ) and d 1 ( l ) ( red line segments ) . Figure S4 . Elementary meshes in double stranded filament organizations . Rotations applied to subunits of double stranded filament organization are referred to a mesh consisting of four neighboring subunits , as shown for the aligned ( panel A ) or staggered ( panel B ) architectures . Each mesh is characterized by its central point ( G , magenta square ) and the different groups of bonds connecting subunits . Panel A . Double - stranded aligned filaments have 2 aligned 19 bond populations ( between subunits ( k 1 , k 2 ) and ( l 1 , l 2 ) ) , 2 transversal bond populations ( subunits ( k 1 , l 2 ) and ( k 2 , l 1 ) ) and two longitudinal groups of bond ( subunits ( k 1 , l 1 ) and ( k 2 , l 2 ) ) . Panel B . Double - stranded staggered filaments have 2 longitudinal bond groups ( subunits ( k 1 , l 1 ) and ( k 2 , l 2 ) ) and 2 transversal bond populations ( subunits ( k 1 , l 2 ) and ( k 2 , l 1 ) ) . Figure S5 . Subunit orientation in filaments . The elastic free energy change depends on filament subunit orientation . Rotations R i , ( i = 1 , … , 6 ) that bring the resting configuration ( center ) to a given subunit orientation ( examples shown at the cartoon periphery ) , are characterized by an invariant vector and angle ( see Table S2 ) . The ( θ , φ ) components of the rotation invariant are indicated in the two last columns of the Table S2 . Figure S6 . Contributions of bending , twisting and coupling to the total elastic free energy . Dependence of total ( panel A ) , bending ( panel B ) , twisting ( panel C ) , coupling ( panel D ) , fractional bending ( panel E ) and fractional coupling ( panel F ) elastic free energies on the angular strain rotation as presented in Figure 4 of main text , but expanded over larger strain angles . We note that at large deformation values of unknown quantity , the linear theory presented in this work may fail . Any function of the rotation strain variables ( ) 3 2 1 , , κ κ κ , with the condition 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 = + + κ κ κ , can be mapped either on the unit sphere or represented as a ( θ  , φ ) - diagram ; the north ( resp . south ) pole of the unit sphere corresponds to the θ = 0 ( resp . θ = 180° ) side of the ( θ ,  φ ) - diagram . Both representations are used in panels A - F . 20 Figure S1 Figure S2 21 Figure S3 22 Figure S4 23 Figure S5 24 Figure S6 25 References 1 .
