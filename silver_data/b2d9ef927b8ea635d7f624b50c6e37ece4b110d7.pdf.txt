To address whether the ulations are not selected based on preferential survival Cell Shape and Rho Regulate Stem Cell Fate 487 on the micropatterns . In all , these results suggest that changes in cell shape alone are sufficient to mediate the switch in hMSC commitment between adipogenic and osteogenic fates . Furthermore , because the effects of cell shape on commitment persist in the absence of proliferation or apoptosis , the effects of cell shape on proliferation or survival are distinct from those on cell fate determination . hMSC Commitment Varies with Changes in Cytoskeletal Tension Changes in cell shape may be transduced into a regula - tory signal by several structures in the cell , including the actin cytoskeleton itself ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . In fact , sparsely plated and well - spread hMSCs exhibited more prominent stress fibers as compared to densely plated and unspread cells . To examine whether the actin cy - toskeleton was involved in the shape - mediated commit - ment process , hMSCs were first cultured with the actin - disrupting agent cytochalasin D in mixed differentiation media conditions at low plating density . Lipid and AP staining revealed that disrupting actin increased adipo - genesis and decreased osteogenesis as compared to untreated controls ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . While these data suggested that the actin cytoskeleton might be impor - tant in the commitment process , we observed that the drug treatment also caused cells to become rounded ( Figure 4A ) . Thus it remained unclear whether cytocha - lasin D affected commitment primarily by changing cell shape or disrupting the actin cytoskeleton . To address this ambiguity , we impaired the actin cy - toskeleton by specifically inhibiting myosin - generated cytoskeletal tension . hMSCs were cultured in mixed me - dia in the presence of Y - 27632 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) , an inhibitor of Rho kinase ( ROCK ) , the Rho effector involved in myosin activation ( Kimura et al . , 1996 ) . In the presence of Y - 27632 , cells remained spread and morphologically similar to untreated controls ( Figure 4A ) . Much like cyto - chalasin D - treated cells , ROCK - inhibited cells exhibited decreased AP and increased lipid production as com - pared to untreated controls ( Figure 4B ) . While this shift in lineages suggests that cell shape - mediated commit - mentinvolvesactomyosincontractility , itispossiblethat drug treatment selects preadipogenic hMSCs by caus - ing preosteogenic cells to die . To exclude this possibil - ity , cells were first differentiated to adipocytes or osteo - blasts , counted , then treated with cytochalasin D or Y - 27632 for 1 week . Cells were then recounted and as - sayed to determine total cell number and viability .

On all days , RhoA activity was significantly higher in low - The dependence of the adipogenic - to - osteogenic shift on cell spreading and ROCK - mediated cytoskeletal ten - versus high - density culture , regardless of culture media ( Figure 5D ) .

These findings suggest the possibility that To examine the levels of active RhoA under various differentiation conditions , cells were plated at low ( 4000 RhoA may be involved in the final common pathway that transduces cell density and soluble factors to regulate cells / cm 2 ) or high ( 12 , 000 cells / cm 2 ) densities and cul - turedinosteogenic , adipogenic , orgrowthmedia ( Figure hMSC commitment .

The degree of commitment caused by RhoA viral infection was comparable to that from stan - RhoA Regulates hMSC Commitment through ROCK and Cytoskeletal Integrity dard induction protocols ( Figure 6D ) .

The osteogenic shift induced by consti - tutively active RhoA - V14 was abrogated by disrupting actin ( Figure 7A ) . Treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 ( 10 (cid:1) M ) orthemyosinIIinhibitorblebbistatin ( 50 (cid:1) M ) also abrogated RhoA - V14 - induced osteogenesis . Interestingly , the redirecting of hMSC commitment by manipulating RhoA signaling coincided with changes in cell shape . That is , osteogenesis was associated with spread cells , while adipogenesis led to cell rounding . To directly examine whether RhoA fully mediates the commitment signals affected by cell shape as well as those from soluble factors , we examined whether acti - vating RhoA rescues osteogenesis in round cells and inactivating RhoA rescues adipogenesis in spread cells . hMSCs were plated onto small and large fibronectin islands and infected with RhoA - N19 or RhoA - V14 . Round cells infected with RhoA - N19 became adipocytes , while spread cells infected with RhoA - V14 became osteo - blasts ( Figures 7B and 7C ) . The osteogenesis induced in these cells was blocked by both Y - 27632 and blebbis - tatin ( Figure 7D ) , indicating that the tension generating systemisrequiredinthisprocess . Surprisingly , constitu - tively active RhoA - V14 - infected cells failed to form osteoblasts when round , and cell spreading blocked dominant - negative RhoA - N19 - induced adipogenesis ( Figures7Band 7C ) . Thatis , cellshape andRhoAactivity are both necessary , but neither is sufficient , to drive the switch in hMSC commitment . While RhoA did not appear to be downstream of the cell spreading requirement for osteogenesis , we ex - plored whether ROCK fully mediated the osteogenic commitment signal in both round and spread cells . hMSCs were plated onto small and large fibronectin islands and infected with adenovirus containing consti - tutively active ROCK ( ROCK (cid:8) 3 ) . Both round and spread cells infected with ROCK (cid:8) 3 became osteoblasts , and the ROCK (cid:8) 3 - induced osteogenesis was inhibited by blebbistatin ( Figure 7E ) . Together , these findings sug - gest that , while RhoA is downstream of soluble differen - tiation signals , cell shape - mediated control ofthe adipo - genic - to - osteogeniccommitmentswitchisregulatedvia ROCK - induced cytoskeletal tension .
