Growing evidence has highlighted the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles , secretory granules , trans - porters , and channels including aquaporin . These trafficking processes require actin remodeling , which is spatiotemporally regulated . Recent researches have come to focus on the motility mechanism of the translocation . In this review , we describe the role of actin at each step of intracellular reserv - ation , exocytosis , docking , fusion with the plasma membrane , and endocytosis , focusing on aquaporin - 2 trafficking . Keywords Actin remodeling . Membrane trafficking . Aquaporin Introduction Trafficking of the intracellular vesicles or membrane protein incorporated in the vesicles is essential for a variety of basic biological processes . Membrane trafficking occurs for the maintenance of the optimal complement of lipid membrane or protein in the targeted site in the cell or for the externalization of compounds outside the cells . In epithelial cells , regulated trafficking of many channel proteins to a specific plasma membrane domain serves to maintain ion and volume homeostasis and signal transduc - tion . In the principal cells of the collecting duct , aquaporin - 2 ( AQP2 ) trafficking is strictly regulated by vasopressin and maintains body water homeostasis . In neurons and endocrine cells , exocytosis of neurotransmitters or hormone - containing vesicles occurs upon specific stimuli . These trafficking processes require actin remodeling . Actin remodeling is strictly regulated by time and localization in the process of membrane trafficking and provides the forces for the movement . Advances in proteomics and live imaging technologies have made it possible to assess the protein complex machinery and its motility . Because the molecular basis for the trafficking has become clearer , recent researches are focusing on the motility mechanism that translocates the vesicles from a donor to an acceptor compartment . In this review , we describe current findings indicating the role of actin at each step of membrane trafficking , focusing on AQP2 trafficking . Reservation in the intracellular storage pool Before stimulation , many channels , transporters , and vesicles containing neurotransmitters and hormones are localized in a specific intracellular compartment that is regulated by actin . Water channel AQP2 is localized in the subapical storage vesicles , which is positive for Rab11 [ 64 , 104 ] . Cortical actin depolymerization is observed during AQP2 exocytosis [ 93 ] . Glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) is localized in the insulin - responsive compartments [ 31 , 119 ] , which is damaged by actin filament disruption [ 78 ] . In neuroendocrine cells , secretory granules are captured by the F - actin - rich cortex where they complete their maturation Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2008 ) 456 : 737 – 745 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00424 - 007 - 0404 - 2 Y .

In chromaffin cells , fodrin , an actin crosslinking protein , stabilizes the cortical actin network and entrap secretory granules in the subplasmalemmal cytoskeleton to serve as a reservoir to supply exocytotic demand [ 2 , 53 ] . In neurons , synaptic vesicles are organized into two pools : the reserve pool ( RP ) and the readily releasable pool ( RRP ; [ 12 , 97 ] ) . The RRP constitutes vesicles docked at the active zone , which is primed to undergo membrane fusion , whereas the RP is a cluster of vesicles present distally from the active zone . Actin is reported to act as a scaffold to impede vesicle dispersion [ 90 ] . F - actin surrounds the RP [ 4 , 15 , 30 , 46 , 83 , 92 ] . Actin depolymerization by cytochalasin D depletes vesicles in RP after high - frequency stimulation at neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ; [ 45 ] ) . How - ever , at the resting NMJ , actin depolymerization by latrunculin A has little effect on the RP [ 83 ] . The diverse effects of actin depolymerization on the RP indicate that regulation of the RP becomes dependent on actin under conditions when the RRP is depleted by stimulation [ 12 ] . These studies indicate that the F - actin network serves to maintain the reservation of the storage pool for several kinds of specialized vesicles . Exocytosis In the process of exocytosis , two distinct views for actin have been proposed . First , actin may provide a track that guides the movement of the vesicles to the targeted plasma membrane domain . Second , the cortical actin network may form a physical barrier that prevents exocytosis . In the delivery of synaptic vesicles to the active zone , several evidences support the first model in which actin polymer - ization plays a facilitatory role in vesicle recruitment . For example , actin depolymerization by latrunculin A delays vesicle recruitment at the Calyx of Held [ 89 ] . However , in Xenopus NMJ , actin depolymerization increases vesicle mobilization , supporting the second model in which actin has an inhibitory role in vesicle recruitment [ 115 ] . The effects of actin - modulating drugs , which reflect the roles of actin in multiple aspects of exocytosis , may mask the real effect of actin reorganization on each aspect . In the translocation of secretory granules in neuroendo - crine cells , stabilization of actin inhibits exocytosis , whereas actin depolymerization enhanced exocytosis , sup - porting the actin barrier model [ 53 ] . Many studies have been performed using secretory cells including lactotropes , melanotrophs , chromaffin and PC12 , pancreatic β cells and mast cells [ 6 , 8 , 9 , 16 , 24 , 25 , 57 , 62 , 71 , 73 , 79 ] . The disruption of actin filaments by latrunculin and mycalolide increases granule motility in PC12 cells [ 11 , 66 ] . Furthermore , the mechanisms regulating the actin barrier in secretory cells were extensively studied . RhoA activation by Go or overexpression of constitutively active RhoA mutant stabilizes the peripheral actin filaments and inhibits exocytosis in stimulated cells [ 3 , 21 , 22 ] . Activation of RhoA / phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase pathway and local production of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) are involved in exocytosis [ 23 , 81 , 91 , 120 ] . Scinderin is known to sever actin filaments in a calcium - dependent manner and bind to PIP2 and actin [ 55 , 121 ] . Scinderin is shown to potentiate calcium - evoked catechol - amine or serotonin release and actin disassembly , and these abilities are inhibited by PIP2 [ 56 , 121 ] . These findings support the model as follows . The actin - severing activity of scinderin is inhibited by binding to PIP2 under resting conditions . Increase in cytosolic calcium dissociates scin - derin from PIP2 and activates its actin - severing activity , resulting in actin disassembly required for the vesicle movement of exocytosis . On the other hand , several reports show a biphasic effect of actin on the exocytosis in secretory cells [ 53 ] . Insulin secretion from pancreatic β cell is increased by a mild treatment with cytochalasin D , while higher concentrations inhibited it [ 73 ] . In PC12 cells , ADP - ribosylation of 20 – 50 % actin by C2 toxin promotes noradrenaline secretion , whereas ADP - ribosylation of more than 60 % of actin attenuates exocytosis [ 57 ] . Similarly , exocytosis in PC12 cells is promoted at low doses of latrunculin but inhibited at high concentrations [ 24 ] . These biphasic effects of actin depolymerization indicate the requirement of a minimal actin structure for exocytosis . Actin is not simply a barrier , but it may also play a positive role in exocytosis . Giner et al . observed that in stimulated chromaffin cells , open spaces devoid of F - actin appeared in the peripheral actin barrier and actin trails were formed that were associated with moving secretory granules [ 26 ] . These findings suggest that actin filaments actively participate in the transport . Motor protein myosin is reported to be involved in the transport process , which is described in the “ Mechanisms of actin - driven transport ” section . The roles of actin in GLUT4 exocytosis are well studied . The exocytosis of GLUT4 - containing vesicles is inhibited by actin disassembly using cytochalasin D or latrunculins [ 72 , 108 ] . On the other hand , the F - actin stabilizer , jasplakinolide , also abolishes GLUT4 translocation [ 38 , 111 ] . Dynamic rearrangements of actin cytoskeleton in - cluding both depolymerization and polymerization , rather than static actin , are important for the trafficking [ 40 ] . Furthermore , GLUT4 - containing vesicles are shown to induce actin comet tails and actin - based motility that are stimulated by insulin in reconstituted systems , indicating the involvement of actin - driven transport [ 39 ] . In addition , myosin Ic is involved in GLUT4 exocytosis [ 5 ] . In AQP2 exocytosis , there are many reports supporting the actin barrier model . Vasopressin depolymerizes apical 738 Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2008 ) 456 : 737 – 745 F - actin in rat inner medullary collecting duct , resulting in the exocytosis of water channel - carrying vesicles [ 93 ] . Both forskolin and okadaic acid stimulate AQP2 translocation by inducing a reorganization of the apical actin network [ 112 ] . Actin depolymerization is a prerequisite for cAMP - dependent translocation of AQP2 [ 41 , 99 ] . These data provide evidence for a role of actin depolymerization in the vasopressin - induced translocation of AQP2 from intracel - lular vesicles to the cell surface . Similar to the exocytosis of secretory vesicles as described above , RhoA inhibition is required for AQP2 translocation [ 100 ] . Tamma et al . show that the stimulation of prostaglandin E3 receptors inhibits vasopressin - induced Rho inactivation ; vasopressin - induced F - actin depolymerization ; and vasopressin - , cAMP - , and forskolin - induced AQP2 translocation [ 101 ] . Rho activation by bradykinin stabilizes cortical F - actin and inhibits AQP2 trafficking [ 102 ] . Furthermore , AQP2 binds to SPA - 1 [ 68 ] . SPA - 1 is a GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) for Rap1 , and the GAP activity of SPA - 1 is required for AQP2 trafficking to the apical membrane . Because Rap1 affects the assembly of F - actin [ 28 , 42 , 70 , 75 , 109 ] , SPA - 1 binding to AQP2 may reduce the levels of Rap1GTP that trigger F - actin disas - sembly in a restricted area , resulting in the promotion of AQP2 trafficking . Indeed , AQP2 trafficking to the apical membrane is impaired in the collecting duct principal cells of SPA - 1 - deficient mice [ 68 ] . SPA - 1 - deficient mice show marked bilateral hydronephrosis due to polyuria [ 43 , 68 ] . Similar to other kinds of trafficking , not only the inhibitory effects but also the facilitatory effects of F - actin assembly on AQP2 exocytosis have been suggested . The actin - depolymerizing agent , cytochalasin D , did not en - hance water permeability of the epithelium of toad urinary bladder [ 20 ] . The authors speculate that F - actin has at least two hypothetical pools : one is involved in the barrier function and the other pool is involved in the transport of AQP2 . Tajika et al . showed that actin depolymerization caused by cytochalasin D or latrunculin B inhibited AQP2 translocation from EEA1 - positive early endosomes to Rab11 - positive subapical storage vesicles [ 104 ] . Further - more , AQP2 forms a multiprotein complex including actin and myosin [ 67 , 69 ] . Vasopressin signaling induces myosin light chain phosphorylation , which is known to enhance myosin – actin filament interaction and the formation of actin fibers [ 7 ] . Recently , myosin is also shown to be critical for AQP2 recycling [ 64 ] . Both the inhibitory and facilitatory roles of F - actin in AQP2 exocytosis have been reported . One of the reasons is the difference in the concentrations of cytoskeleton - modulating agents used in these studies . AQP2 trafficking is facilitated by 6 – 25 min incubation with a low con - centration of cytochalasin D ( 2 μ M ; [ 99 ] ) , whereas 30 – 120 min incubation with higher concentrations of cytochalasin D ( 2 – 59 μ M ; [ 104 ] ) inhibits the trafficking . Although these studies use different cell lines , these results indicate that a partial depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton facilitates AQP2 trafficking whereas complete depolymerization inhibits the trafficking . Cytoskeleton - modulating agents inevitably affect the overall cell archi - tecture , which makes the experiments examining the role of actin in AQP2 trafficking difficult . In the process that the physiological trafficking of AQP2 occurs in vivo , the actin dynamics may change in a restricted narrow area around the AQP2 molecule and may vary among different areas within the cell . The characteristics of exocytosis of specialized vesicles and membrane proteins are highly diverse especially in their time course and responsiveness for stimuli . However , observed findings concerning the role of actin reorganiza - tion in each kind of exocytosis are similar . Because both stimulatory and inhibitory roles of actin are observed in each exocytosis , regulation of actin remodeling may be different by time and localization during the translocation . The mechanisms that separate actin into functionally distinct groups will be clarified by the application of time lapse imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution . The late stage of exocytosis , docking , and fusion At the late stage of exocytosis when the vesicles reach the subplasmalemmal region , actin polymerization is reported to be important in secretory cells [ 53 ] . Several evidences in PC12 cells suggest that the sequential ordering of inter - sectin - 1L , Cdc42 , N - WASP , and Arp2 / 3 at the interface between the secretory granules and the plasma membrane induces local actin polymerization at the docking site and the exocytosis of the secretory vesicles [ 21 , 24 , 54 , 107 ] . At the stage of docking to the plasma membrane , actin depolymerization is reported to be required , whereas actin polymerization is required at the stage of fusion to the plasma membrane in several kinds of exocytosis . In yeast , actin disassembly is required for producing fusion - competent vacuoles at the docking step , but actin assembly is required for the fusion process [ 19 ] . Actin disassembly is required for recruiting SNARE proteins to a vertex ring on docked vacuoles before the fusion process occurs [ 116 ] . Generally , there are three types of fusion : full fusion , kiss - and - run , and kiss - and - coat [ 95 ] . During full fusion , the secretory granules completely fuse and collapse into the plasma membrane . During kiss - and - run , the secretory vesicles transiently fuse with the plasma membrane , maintaining the form of the vesicle and a small fusion pore that very rapidly reseals to retrieve the secretory vesicle membrane nearly intact . Full fusion and kiss - and - run occur with very rapid kinetics in neurons and neuroendocrine Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2008 ) 456 : 737 – 745 739 cells . On the other hand , during kiss - and - coat observed in various kinds of secretory cells , secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane , undergo fusion pore dilation , and remain as morphologically distinct compartment for many seconds to many minutes before fusion pore resealing [ 95 ] . Kiss - and - coat exocytosis is especially associated with actin assembly around the vesicle . In pancreatic acini , actin assembly occurs on zymogen granules undergoing exocy - tosis [ 65 ] . In Xenopus eggs , actin assembly starts at the fusion pore and then spreads along the entire granule surface to compress the exocytosing granules [ 94 ] . Sokac et al . propose that compartment mixing of the plasma membrane components with the components of the secre - tory vesicle membrane act as a spatiotemporal trigger for actin assembly on exocytosing vesicles [ 95 ] . The roles of actin in full fusion and kiss - and - run are not fully clarified because of their rapid kinetics . However , Rac1 is critically involved in the fusion of synaptic vesicles [ 13 , 32 ] , sup - porting the similar roles of actin assembly . With regard to transporters and channels including AQP2 , the roles of actin remodeling in the docking and fusion processes are not fully examined . However , SNARE proteins are shown to be involved in these processes [ 31 , 70 ] . Evidences obtained from various kinds of cells suggest that actin polymerization is important for the late stage of exocytosis in the subplasmalemmal region and the fusion stage , while actin depolymerization is required for the docking stage . Further studies are required to clarify the mechanisms of spatiotemporally tight regulation of actin remodeling . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Although there are several types of endocytosis : phagocy - tosis , macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and caveolae - mediated endocytosis [ 37 , 96 ] , we describe in this review the role of actin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which is the main pathway for endocytosis of synaptic vesicles , secretory vesicles , transporters , and channels . Many evidences obtained from various kinds of cells show that actin polymerization is important for each step of endocytosis : membrane invagination , scission , vesicle release , and transport of the vesicle to an intracellular compartment including a specific storage pool . In fibroblast cells , vesicle scission is observed at the time when the actin polymerization burst reaches its peak level [ 61 ] . Just before internalization , transient actin polymerization is observed in both fibroblast cells and S . cerevisiae cells [ 35 , 37 , 59 ] . S . cerevisiae cells are often used to examine the role of actin in the processes of invagination and scission . Evidences derived from S . cerevisiae support a model [ 35 – 37 , 63 , 84 ] : the endocytotic coat is surrounded by Arp2 / 3 complex activators to nucleate actin filaments , which form a cone surrounding the coat . The endocytotic coat and the underlying plasma membrane are pulled toward the interior of the cell by the growing actin network . The GTPase , dynamin , is involved in the formation and pinching off of clathrin - coated pits to form clathrin - coated vesicles [ 17 , 59 , 122 ] . Dynamin has a GTP - dependent twisting activity on membrane tubules when tension is applied at the site [ 85 ] . Cortactin binds to dynamin and F - actin , activates the Arp2 / 3 complex that nucleates actin polymerization , and is recruited to the scission site at the timing of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization and the membrane scission [ 10 , 47 , 60 , 61 , 105 ] . HIP1R forms a complex with cortactin and caps actin filaments [ 48 ] . Because HIP1R localizes on the vesicle surface and dynamin localizes at the neck , it is postulated that the actin meshwork grows via new filament assembly at the vesicle neck and is anchored to the vesicle surface by Hip1R , so that the vesicle is pushed away from the plasma membrane . With regard to transporters and channels , the roles of actin remodeling in the membrane invagination and scission processes are not fully examined . However , dynamin is shown to be critically involved in these processes [ 31 , 51 , 98 ] , suggesting the similar roles of actin in these cases . AQP2 also undergoes clathrin - mediated endocytosis . AQP2 is localized in clathrin - coated pits and dominant - negative dynamin inhibits AQP2 endocytosis [ 98 ] . Furthermore , AQP2 is shown to interact with heat shock protein hsc70 , which plays an important role in the ATPase - dependent uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles during endocytosis [ 52 ] . Functional knockdown of hsc70 activity results in membrane accumulation of AQP2 [ 52 ] . For several G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) that contain PDZ domains , an anchor between the forming vesicle and the actin cytoskeleton is formed via ezrin / radixin / moesin ( ERM ) proteins , inducing a delayed internalization [ 29 , 80 ] . This finding indicates that actin plays a role in specifying the timing of scission and internalization . In AQP2 trafficking , the ERM protein moesin is shown to be a key player in the regulation of cell surface expression of AQP2 [ 103 ] . After the vesicles are released from the plasma mem - brane , actin polymerization is important for transporting the vesicle toward the cell interior . In the reticulospinal giant synapse of lamprey , F - actin develops from the plasma membrane and reaches toward the internal synaptic vesicle cluster [ 4 , 92 ] . The actin filaments associate with clathrin - coated vesicles and uncoated synaptic vesicles along their length . Disrupting these filaments by C2 toxin increases clathrin - coated pits on the plasma membrane and decreases the internal vesicle cluster . These findings show the facilitatory roles of the actin filaments in transporting . This process is supposed to be driven by actin polymerization / treadmilling [ 12 , 59 ] using a mechanism similar to 740 Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2008 ) 456 : 737 – 745 pathogen propulsion by comet - tail - like actin structures or by actin - associated molecular motors such as myosin [ 107 ] . These mechanisms are described in the “ Mechanisms of actin - driven transport ” section . Mechanisms of actin - driven transport Actin is required for vesicle movement at multiple steps as described above . There are two ways in actin - based motility [ 29 ] . First , actin polymerization itself can propel vesicles similar to the propulsion of some pathogenic bacteria by comet - tail - like actin structures . Second , actin serves as a track for the motor protein myosin . Actin polymerization motility is explained by the Brownian ratchet models [ 37 ] . In this model , the actin filament grows through the addition of ATP – actin mono - mers in the space between the actin filament and the vesicle , which is provided by the Brownian movement of the vesicle or the random bending of the actin filament . The Brownian movement of the vesicle biased by the growth of the actin filament and the elastic energy in the bent filament push the vesicle forward . This actin polymerization model can explain the vesicle movement that have comet - tail - like actin structures [ 34 , 58 , 74 , 86 , 106 ] including GLUT4 as described in the “ Exocytosis ” section . The actin comet tail is composed of branched actin - filament network induced by the activation of Arp2 / 3 and asymmetrical localization of the Arp2 / 3 activator on the vesicle , which is important for its movement [ 113 ] . Actin polymerization also generates force for endocytotic internalization as described in the “ Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ” section . Another type of actin - driven transport is myosin motor - dependent movement . Myosin is shown to be required for movement penetrating the cortex actin barrier along actin tracks for extended distances and shown to be involved in various kinds of trafficking [ 96 ] . Myosin Va transports secretory granules in PC12 cells [ 88 ] and pancreatic β cells [ 114 ] . Myosin II is involved in the exocytosis of secretory vesicles in lacrimal acinar epithelial cells [ 33 ] . Myosin II is implicated in the exocytosis in chromaffin cells because phosphorylation of light chain occurs in exocytosis [ 27 ] . Myosin is also involved in the exocytosis of GLUT4 and AQP2 as described above . Furthermore , myosin VI is involved in the exocytosis of GLUT1 [ 82 , 96 ] and the endocytosis of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ; [ 1 ] ) . The structure of myosin Va is well studied [ 18 , 29 ] . Myosin Va is a homodimer consisting of two identical heavy chains . The heavy chain contains the N - terminal head domain containing the binding sites for actin and ATP , the neck domain with six calmodulin and light chain bind - ing sites , and C - terminal globular tail domain containing the cargo - binding sites . The globular tail can bind and inhibit the ATPase activity of the N terminus , suggesting that cargo binding to the tail domain causes a conformation change leading to motor activation [ 50 , 110 ] . Furthermore , the tail domain contains two distinct cargo - binding mod - ules : one for vesicles and another for vacuoles , suggesting specific regulation for vesicle vs organelle motility [ 76 , 77 ] . Calcium , which is involved in various kinds of exocy - tosis , also regulates myosin Va . The increase in calcium concentrations activates myosin Va ATPase by inducing an extended conformation between the tail domain and the neck domain [ 18 , 44 , 49 , 117 ] . In addition , calcium activates the F - actin - severing protein scinderin [ 14 ] . These evidences support the model : increase in intracellular calcium concen - trations induces actin disassembly by scinderin and myosin Va transports cargo toward the plasma membrane along the remaining fine actin filament . In addition , increase in calcium concentrations dissociates calmodulin from the neck of myosin Va where syntaxin 1A binds subsequently , confining the exocytotic site [ 118 ] . Concluding remarks Actin remodeling is required for each trafficking stages of various kinds of specialized vesicles , transporters , and channels . Recent progress shows that actin dynamics is strictly regulated by the time and localization for providing the coordinated movement . The regulation mechanisms will be clarified by the application of time lapse imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and other methods that enable the assessment of the real - time molecular dynamics in a small area in live cells .
