SUMMARY F - BAR domain proteins regulate and sense mem - brane curvature by interacting with negatively charged phospholipids and assembling into higher - order scaffolds . However , regulatory mechanisms controlling these interactions are poorly understood . Here , we show that Drosophila Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) is autoregulated by a C - terminal SH3 domain module that interacts directly with its F - BAR domain . Sur - prisingly , this autoregulation does not mediate a simple ‘‘on - off’’ switch for membrane remodeling . Instead , the isolated Nwk F - BAR domain efﬁciently assembles into higher - order structures and deforms membranes only within a limited range of negative membrane charge , and autoregulation elevates this range . Thus , autoregulation could either reduce membrane binding or promote higher - order assem - bly , depending on local cellular membrane composi - tion . Our ﬁndings uncover an unexpected mecha - nism by which lipid composition directs membrane remodeling . INTRODUCTION Membrane remodeling is critical for cellular processes such as cargo trafﬁcking , signaling , cell motility , and organelle biogen - esis , and it requires the concerted action of scores of proteins that bind and actively shape cellular membranes . However , we still do not understand the underlying mechanisms that spatially and temporally target the activities of these proteins within the cell . BAR ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ) domain family proteins are important mediators of cellular membrane remodeling and form banana - shaped a - helical dimers that use a positively charged binding surface to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2015 ) . Further , they assemble into stable higher - order scaffolds that induce or stabilize membrane curvature over hundreds of nano - meters ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ; Becalska et al . , 2013 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . While it remains uncertain whether BAR do - mains actively generate or stabilize membrane curvature in vivo , in either case , these activities require tight cellular regulation . However , the molecular mechanisms that regulate and target these proteins have only begun to be explored ( Roberts - Gal - braith and Gould , 2010 ) . Many BAR - domain proteins possess Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains that mediate interactions with regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and other membrane - remodeling proteins such as dynamin ( Owen et al . , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . Recently , SH3 domains have been implicated in directly regulating BAR domains via in - tramolecular interactions ( Wang et al . , 2009 ; Guerrier et al . , 2009 ; Rao et al . , 2010 ; Va´zquez et al . , 2013 ; Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Kast et al . , 2014 ; Chen et al . , 2014 ; Wu and Baumgart , 2014 ) . In general , SH3 domain interactions inhibit the ability of BAR do - mains to induce membrane remodeling when overexpressed in cells and in vitro ; however , only limited evidence exists for the role of SH3 - mediated autoregulation of BAR domains in vivo ( Kumar et al . , 2009 ; Guerrier et al . , 2009 ) . Further , little is known about how SH3 domain autoregulation affects different steps of BAR domain membrane binding , higher - order assembly , and deformation . Nervous wreck ( nwk ) encodes a protein containing an N - termi - nal Fes / Cip4 homology - BAR ( F - BAR ) domain and two SH3 do - mains . Nwk regulates the trafﬁc and signaling output of synaptic growth receptors at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) through its interactions with the membrane , actin nucle - ation machinery , and other endocytic proteins including dyna - min , Dap160 / Intersectin , and Sorting Nexin 16 ( Rodal et al . , 2008 ; O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ; Rodal et al . , 2011 ) . These ac - tivities and interactions deﬁne a recycling route by which acti - vated receptors can be removed from signal - permissive early endosomes , downregulating their activities and controlling syn - aptic growth ( Rodal et al . , 2011 ) . Mammalian Nwk homologs have been implicated in membrane remodeling and receptor trafﬁc in stereocilia and in cerebellar granule neurons ( Cao Cell Reports 13 , 1 – 13 , December 22 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors 1 Please cite this article in press as : Kelley et al . , Membrane Charge Directs the Outcome of F - BAR Domain Lipid Binding and Autoregulation , Cell Re - ports ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . celrep . 2015 . 11 . 044 et al . , 2013 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) . Unraveling these trafﬁcking pathways requires a deeper understanding of the membrane - deforming activities of Nwk . We previously reported that the F - BAR domain of Nwk binds to negatively charged phospho - lipids , similar to canonical F - BAR domains . The Nwk F - BAR self - assembles into zigzags , distinct from canonical F - BAR pro - teins , and thus induces membrane scallops and ridges rather than membrane tubules ( Becalska et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we describe regulatory mechanisms that direct the membrane re - modeling activity of the Nwk F - BAR domain in the context of the full - length protein . RESULTS The F - BAR Domain and C Terminus of Nwk Are Required for In Vivo Localization and Function To investigate the importance of Nwk membrane - remodeling activity in vivo , we tested the role of the F - BAR domain in Nwk localization and synaptic growth at the Drosophila NMJ . We expressed EGFP - tagged Nwk variants ( full - length Nwk [ Nwk - EGFP ] , Nwk lacking its F - BAR domain [ Nwk D 1 – 428 - EGFP , and the Nwk F - BAR domain alone [ Nwk 1 – 428 - EGFP ] ) in the nwk null mutant background ( Figures 1A , 1B , S1A , and S1B ) . As has been previously reported for the nwk null and other endocytic trafﬁc mutants ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ; Dickman et al . , 2006 ) , nwk mutants expressing GFP alone exhibit an increase in total synaptic bouton number at the NMJ , as well as an increase in ‘‘satellite’’ boutons that bud off the main axis of the axon terminal ( arrows , Figure 1A ) . This phenotype is a result of excess growth factor signaling in the absence of normal membrane recycling pathways ( Rodal et al . , 2008 ; O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ) . Nwk - EGFP expression rescued the synaptic overgrowth and satellite bouton phenotypes of nwk mutants , although Nwk D 1 – 428 - EGFP exhibited no rescuing activity ( Figure 1B ) . In contrast , Nwk 1 – 428 - EGFP exhibited a more severe synaptic overgrowth and satellite bouton pheno - type than the nwk null mutant ( Figure 1B ) . These data indicate that the C terminus of Nwk is required to properly regulate its function . To investigate the basis of the phenotypes of Nwk 1 – 428 - EGFP at the NMJ , we examined the localization of Nwk variants in ﬁxed tissue in the nervous system , where endogenous Nwk is ex - pressed ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) . At NMJs and in cell bodies in the ventral ganglion , Nwk - EGFP localized in a similar pattern to that previously reported for endogenous Nwk , in occasional puncta and in the ‘‘periactive zone’’ region surrounding Bruchpi - lot ( BRP ) - labeled active zones ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast , Nwk D 1 – 428 - EGFP exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic localization , and Nwk 1 – 428 - EGFP was tightly localized to the plasma mem - brane ( Figure 1C ) . Similar results were obtained upon ectopic expression in larval salivary glands ( Figure 1C ) , where Nwk - EGFP and Nwk D 1 – 428 - EGFP exhibited a very similar localization to the cytoplasm and to occasional puncta , while Nwk 1 – 428 - eGFP was strongly targeted to the plasma membrane . Taken together , these data indicate that selective membrane targeting of Nwk in vivo requires both the F - BAR domain and the C - termi - nal sequence including SH3 domains and is essential for proper NMJ development . Nwk C - Terminal Sequences Regulate Its Membrane - Deforming Activity Next , we investigated the regulation of the Nwk F - BAR domain by C - terminal sequences using a heterologous expression assay in Drosophila S2 cells , which do not express endogenous Nwk . We previously showed using this assay that the F - BAR domain of Nwk ( Nwk 1 – 428 ) localized to the S2 cell plasma membrane and generated membrane buds that were extended into protru - sions by the actin cytoskeleton ( Becalska et al . , 2013 ; Kelley et al . , 2015 ) . We tested the activities of GFP - tagged full - length Nwk or FCHSD2 , a murine Nwk ortholog , and found that unlike their respective isolated F - BAR domains , they did not generate protrusions and exhibited a predominantly cytoplasmic localiza - tion with occasional puncta ( Figures 2A – 2D ) , suggesting that the C terminus of Nwk contains a conserved inhibitory activity for its F - BAR domain . We generated a series of C - terminal truncations of Nwk and quantiﬁed protrusion formation in S2 cells , and we found that the inhibitory activity mapped to the second SH3 domain ( SH3b ; Figures 2A , 2B , and 2D ) . Given our previous ﬁnding that puriﬁed Nwk 1 – 731 ( which includes both SH3 domains ) exhibits reduced membrane binding compared to the isolated F - BAR domain ( Becalska et al . , 2013 ) , SH3b - domain - mediated inhibition is likely autoinhibitory , rather than due to a trans - acting factor . Further , inhibition did not require a short proline - rich stretch at the N terminus of Nwk ( Nwk 10 – 731 ; Figures 2A , 2B , and 2D ) , suggesting that this sequence does not mediate auto - inhibition via canonical SH3 - domain / polyproline interactions . Nwk SH3 Domains Bind to the F - BAR Domain Tips via Electrostatic Interactions Next , we tested the prediction that autoinhibition is mediated by direct interactions between the Nwk F - BAR and SH3b domain using glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) pull - down assays with pu - riﬁed Nwk fragments , and we found that the F - BAR domain could co - precipitate with the SH3b domain ( Figure 3A ) . We then tested the salt sensitivity of Nwk F - BAR / SH3 interactions to differentiate between hydrophobic interactions ( required for canonical proline - rich ligands ) or electrostatic interactions . Co - precipitation of the Nwk F - BAR domain with the GST - SH3b domain was sensitive to increasing ionic strength ( Figure 3A ) . Further , interaction of the F - BAR domain with a tandem GST - SH3ab domain was less sensitive than the GST - SH3b domain alone , suggesting that both SH3 domains contribute to the F - BAR C terminus interaction ( Figure 3A ) . Wethenusedtheproteinhomology / analogyrecognitionengine program Phyre ( Kelley and Sternberg , 2009 ) to model the Nwk SH3b domain against a fold library of all existing PDB crystal structures . The highest - scoring Phyre model was based on the structure of the BIN1 / AMPH2 SH3 domain ( PDB structure c1mv3A ) . Using this model ( Figures 3B and S2A ) , we mutated conserved charged residues in the RT - loop of the Nwk SH3b domain ( E652 and E654 ) , which are predicted to be in a similar orientation to the residues mediating electrostatic interactions of the Syndapin 1 SH3 domain with its F - BAR domain ( Rao et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , we mutated conserved charged residues in the N - src loop oftheNwk SH3b domain ( D673andD674 ) ( Figures 3C and S2A ) . Nwk - SH3b E654R showed reduced F - BAR binding , while E652 , D673 , and D674 did not appear to play critical roles 2 Cell Reports 13 , 1 – 13 , December 22 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors Please cite this article in press as : Kelley et al . , Membrane Charge Directs the Outcome of F - BAR Domain Lipid Binding and Autoregulation , Cell Re - ports ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . celrep . 2015 . 11 . 044 ( Figure 3C ) . Interestingly , Nwk - SH3b E654R did not disrupt binding to a previously identiﬁed ligand , Dap160 ( Rodal et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that the function of E654 in binding to the Nwk F - BAR is a speciﬁc rather than general feature of the SH3 domain ( Figure S2B ) . Finally , to test whether disrupting the interaction between the SH3b and F - BAR domains activates Nwk Figure 1 .

Cellsexpress - ing Nwk E654R exhibited membrane - remodeling activity similar to Nwk 1 – 428 ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , SH3 - domain - dependent inhibition of Nwk F - BAR activity is likely mediated primarily by electrostatic interactions and not by canonical SH3 - proline motif interactions . Next , we examined which site on the F - BAR domain is required for electrostatic interactions with the SH3 domain mod - ule . The tips of the Nwk F - BAR domain feature strong positive charge , which is important for high - afﬁnity membrane associa - tion in vitro and membrane - deforming activity in S2 cells ( Becal - ska et al . , 2013 ) . Nwk 1 – 428 D tips lacks the positively charged tips but exhibits a similar urea denaturation proﬁle to Nwk 1 – 428 and is likely to be well - folded in solution ( Becalska et al . , 2013 ) . Nwk SH3a and SH3b exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced binding to Nwk 1 – 428 D tips compared to wild - type Nwk 1 – 428 ( Figure 3E ) . These results indicate that the F - BAR tips are speciﬁcally required for Nwk SH3 - F - BAR interactions in solution . Nwk SH3 Domains Decrease F - BAR Membrane Binding To test the role of the Nwk SH3 domains in regulation of F - BAR domain activity , we evaluated how the interaction between Figure 2 .

We previously showed that when compared to Nwk 1 - 428 in bulk liposome co - sedimen - tation assays , Nwk 1 – 731 requires more phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) to bind to membranes ( Becal - ska et al . , 2013 ) . To determine if Nwk SH3 domains were required and sufﬁ - cient for inhibition of membrane bind - ing , we compared liposome co - sedi - mentation of Nwk 1 – 428 , Nwk 1 – 731 , and Nwk 1 – 633 ( SH3b domain truncated ; Fig - ure 4A ) . Compared to Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 , Nwk 1 – 633 required an interme - diate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration for binding ( Figure 4B ) , suggesting that the SH3b domain is involved in , but not sufﬁcient for , inhibiting membrane binding by puriﬁed Nwk 1 – 731 and that intervening sequences ( including the SH3a domain ) contribute to the remaining autoinhibitory effect . In contrast , in S2 cells , relief of autoinhibition depends more strictly on the electrostatic surface of the SH3b domain ( Figures 2A , 2B , and 2D ) , suggesting that in a cellular context , a binding partner may modulate the contribution of SH3a to autoinhibition . We then tested the effects of a puriﬁed SH3ab fragment in trans on Nwk 1 – 428 membrane binding . We found that pre - incuba - tion of the F - BAR domain with SH3ab dramatically shifted the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent binding proﬁle of Nwk 1 – 428 to more closely resemble Nwk 1 – 731 ( Figure 4C ) . Furthermore , the SH3ab frag - ment did not co - sediment with liposomes , either on its own or with low or high concentrations of Nwk 1 – 428 ( Figures 4C and S3A ) . These results suggest that the interaction with the Nwk F - BAR domain directly inhibits membrane binding in solution and that the SH3 domains do not bind to the F - BAR domain when it is membrane associated . To test whether autoregulation alters the properties of Nwk once bound to the membrane , we examined liposomes incubated with Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 by cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) . Liposomes incubated with Nwk 1 – 731 exhibited the same types of protein - dependent deformations 4 Cell Reports 13 , 1 – 13 , December 22 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors Please cite this article in press as : Kelley et al . , Membrane Charge Directs the Outcome of F - BAR Domain Lipid Binding and Autoregulation , Cell Re - ports ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . celrep . 2015 . 11 . 044 as we previously observed for Nwk 1 – 428 ( pointing , pinching , and scalloping ; Figure 4D ) . These types of deformations did not change with longer protein - liposome incubation times ( Fig - ure S3B ) and were observed more frequently with increasing protein concentration , suggesting that they are actively gener - ated by Nwk ( Figures 4D , S3E , and S3F ) . Finally , we did not observe any new properties such as vesiculation or tubulation for Nwk 1 – 731 compared to Nwk 1 – 428 under these conditions ( Figures 4D and S3C – S3E ) . Thus , SH3 domain - mediated au - toregulation via F - BAR domain tips inhibits membrane binding in solution , without changing the membrane - deforming prop - erties of Nwk . Nwk - Mediated Membrane Deformation Is Associated with Assembly of F - BAR Dimers into Stable Scaffolds Next , weconsideredtwopossibleexplanationsforreducedmem - brane binding for Nwk 1 – 731 compared to Nwk 1 – 428 in bulk assays : either Nwk 1 – 731 could be uniformly reduced compared to Nwk 1 – 428 onallliposomes ( suggestingageneralreductioninbind - ing ) , or alternatively , the fraction of liposomes bound by Nwk 1 – 731 could be decreased ( suggesting a more complex or cooperative model for binding ) .

To determine if Nwk autoregulation affects its pro - pensity to assemble on ( and , by extension , deform ) mem - branes , we next examined higher - order assembly of SNAP - tagged Nwk using ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments . BAR domains can form stable scaffolds on membrane , limiting lipid ﬂuidity and lateral diffusion of pro - teins ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , individually bound or incompletely oligomerized BAR domain dimers are expected to be mobile , either through exchange between the membrane and solution or rapid lipid diffusion . Therefore , assembled BAR domains should recover very slowly after photobleaching , while individually bound or disordered BAR domains should recover rapidly . Figure 5 .

For the entire population of GUVs , recovery of Nwk 1 – 731 was signiﬁcantly lower than Nwk 1 – 428 10 min post - bleach ( Figures 5D and 5E ) , and the distribution of total recovery for Nwk 1 – 428 was much wider , whereas Nwk 1 – 731 recovery never ex - ceeded 11 . 5 % .

Notably , protein mobility on Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 GUVs that were deformed was not signiﬁcantly different , indicating similar behavior of assembled F - BAR pro - teins at sites of deformation for both Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 . These results suggest that under these conditions , the isolated F - BAR domain is capable of interacting with the membrane in a range of different assembly states with distinct FRAP proﬁles , from individually bound and disordered with rapid turnover and protein ﬂuorescence recovery to assembled stable protein scaffolds with slower turnover and protein ﬂuorescence recov - ery . In contrast , Nwk 1 – 731 protein coats do not recover after photobleaching , indicating that under these conditions all Cell Reports 13 , 1 – 13 , December 22 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors 7 Please cite this article in press as : Kelley et al . , Membrane Charge Directs the Outcome of F - BAR Domain Lipid Binding and Autoregulation , Cell Re - ports ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . celrep . 2015 . 11 . 044 Figure 6 .

Nwk Autoregulation Increases the Phosphoinositide Requirement for Membrane Deformation without Altering the Mechanism of Membrane Binding Next , we tested whether SH3 domains speciﬁcally enhance as - sembly of Nwk F - BAR domains or if the differences in the assem - bly and deformation properties of Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 on GUVs of a ﬁxed lipid composition ( Figure 5 ) reﬂect inherent dif - ferences in Nwk F - BAR behavior at different points on the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding curve ( Figure 4B ) . We ﬁrst tested the ability of Nwk 1 – 731 and Nwk 1 – 428 to bind and deform GUVs with different PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 compositions . Remarkably , at 1 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a concen - tration at which Nwk 1 – 428 is only partially membrane associated in co - sedimentation assays ( Figure 4B ) , we found that it deco - rated only a small fraction of highly deformed GUVs , much like Nwk 1 – 731 at 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . Further , at 20 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a concentration at which all of Nwk 1 – 731 is bound to li - posomes in co - sedimentation assays ( Figure 4B ) , all GUVs were bound but poorly deformed , much like Nwk 1 – 428 at 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . To rule out any quantitative differences in the behavior of Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 reﬂecting different mech - anisms of assembly or deformation , we normalized the fraction of membrane - bound Nwk to the extent of membrane deforma - tion at the full range of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentrations . Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 exhibited quantitatively indistinguishable behavior in this analysis ( Figure 6C ) . These results suggest an inherent bias of the F - BAR domain toward high - order scaffolds and mem - brane deformation when binding conditions are more stringent . Several different parameters could together account for the observation that a small number of GUVs are highly decorated and deformed under stringent binding conditions . F - BAR pro - teins may exhibit nucleation behavior , resulting in recruitment of protein molecules to a small fraction of vesicles , until the con - centration of protein in solution is depleted below a critical as - sembly threshold ( nucleation mechanism ) . However , our obser - vations also raise the possibility that F - BAR proteins have inherently different activities on membranes of low versus high PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 content ( lipid - directed mechanism ) . To examine this possibility , we tested F - BAR - domain - mediated membrane deformation in cell - sized water droplets encapsulated within a phospholipid membrane . In this system , protein is emulsiﬁed in a mix of lipid and oil , resulting in the formation of droplets of pro - tein surrounded by an interface of lipid , with head groups facing the protein in the aqueous phase ( Figure S4A ; Hase and Yoshi - kawa , 2006 ; Miyazaki et al . , 2015 ) . Compared to GUVs , droplets are isolated from each other and therefore not subject to nucle - ation effects . Both SNAP - Nwk 1 – 428 and SNAP - Nwk 1 – 731 induced deformation and crumpling of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - encapsulated droplets , but not droplets without PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figures 6D , 6E , S4B , and S4C ; Movies S4 and S5 ) . Further , the SNAP tag alone did not deform PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - encapsulated droplets , indicating that crum - pling is a speciﬁc activity of Nwk ( Figure S4B ) . Remarkably , deformation was prevalent at 2 . 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 for both Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 but rare at 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , supporting a lipid - directed mechanism that favors deformation at lower negative membrane charge ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . One possible mechanism to account for differential activities of the Nwk F - BAR domains with changing negative charge could be the orientation of the F - BAR on the membrane . F - BAR do - mains interact with membranes through positively charged concave surfaces when assembled on highly curved mem - branes but can also interact with membranes in a number of other orientations , including a deformation - inactive side - lying state ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Yu and Schulten , 2013 ; Becalska et al . , 2013 ) . To test whether different modes of protein - mem - brane interaction may be favored depending on membrane charge , we used single - particle electron microscopy ( EM ) on lipid monolayers to compare the orientations of the Nwk F - BAR domain at 2 . 5 % and 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure 6F ) . The Nwk F - BAR forms an S - shaped dimer whose chirality allows sin - gle - particle averages to be assigned to concave - surface - down , side - lying , or convex - surface - down orientations ( Figure 6F ; Becalska et al . , 2013 ) . We found that at 2 . 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the concave - surface - down orientation predominates , whereas at 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 Nwk does not show a strong proclivity for any one orientation . These data support a model by which limited membrane charge results in an orientation - selective binding mode , favoring assembly and membrane deformation , while high membrane charge favors promiscuous binding and dimin - ishes the likelihood of assembly .

We acutely increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 using YU1422670 , a small - molecule inhibitor of OCRL ( Pirruccello et al . , 2014 ) , which is an important phosphoinosi - tide - 5 - phosphatase in S2 cells ( Ben El Kadhi et al . , 2011 ) . This compound is active in Drosophila , as it recapitulates the reported OCRL mutant phenotype of increased F - actin levels in S2 cells ( BenEl Kadhi et al . , 2011 ; Figure S5 ) . Treatment withlow concen - trations ofthedrug ( 10 m M ) for15minincreased cellular deforma - tion in Nwk 1 – 731 - EGFP - expressing S2 cells , supporting our in vitro ﬁnding that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 promotes membrane binding by Nwk 1 – 731 ( Figures 7A – 7C ) . In contrast , high levels of drug ( 30 m M ) decreased deformation of Nwk 1 – 428 - EGFP - expressing cells , though Nwk was still localized to the membrane ( Figures 7D – 7F ) , supporting our ﬁnding that high levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 decouple membrane binding and deformation . YU1422670 - treated cells that were not expressing Nwk had normal cellular morphology and actin localization ( despite modestly increased levels of F - actin ) ( Figure S5 ) , indicating that the differences ( F ) Comparison of the orientation of Nwk 1 – 428 dimers on lipid monolayers with 2 . 5 % or 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 .

These results provide strong in vivo support for the model that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels can shift the F - BAR domain between unbound , membrane - deforming , and promis - cuous binding states and that autoregulation increases the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration at which these states occur . DISCUSSION Mechanisms of Nwk Regulation by Intramolecular Interactions and Membrane Composition Here , we report that the F - BAR domain of Nwk is autoregulated by its C - terminal SH3 domains and that the Nwk C terminus is critical for regulation of its F - BAR localization and membrane re - modeling function in vivo . Surprisingly , membrane composition is a key factor in the efﬁciency of remodeling , and autoregulation alters the optimal membrane charge requirement for maximum F - BAR activity . Nwk is one of several F - BAR proteins with two SH3 domains ( Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2010 ) , and we found that the SH3b domain mediates the majority of the inhibitory effect in a cellular context . This inhibition occurs via non - canonical electro - static interactions between the SH3b and F - BAR domains , similar to Syndapin ( Rao et al . , 2010 ) . Further , we show that the autoregulatory SH3 domains are displaced from the F - BAR domain upon lipid binding . Our results indicate that regulation may directly reduce the probability of membrane binding by occluding residues important for interactions with the mem - brane . Our ﬁnding that binding and deformation scale similarly for Nwk 1 – 428 and Nwk 1 – 731 ( Figure 6C ) argues that they do not bind , oligomerize , or deform membranes by distinct mecha - nisms and that SH3 domains do not actively promote higher - order assembly via inter - dimer interactions . Instead , the SH3 domains shift the threshold for binding so that binding and deformation occur at higher negative charge . Importantly , we show that both the isolated F - BAR domain and the full - length protein actively generate similar types of membrane deforma - tions ( Figures 4D and 6D ; Movies S4 and S5 ) , arguing against the model that these proteins merely sense curvature , even under stringent binding conditions . To date , autoregulation of BAR domain proteins has been thought of as an ‘‘on - off switch’’ for membrane binding , released by binding partners ( Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2010 ; Mei - necke et al . , 2013 ) or by increased membrane charge ( Wu and Baumgart , 2014 ) . However , our data support a more nuanced explanation of these inhibitory interactions that depends criti - cally on local membrane composition . While the net effect of autoinhibition is to shift the membrane - binding and membrane - deformation curves to higher negative charge , we found that the membrane - binding and membrane - deforming curves do not overlap , as would be predicted by the simple ‘‘on - off switch’’ model . Rather , our FRAP , GUV , and droplet deformation data indicate that higher - order assembly and deformation occur efﬁciently only within a range or ‘‘sweet spot’’ of negative charge and that high levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 promote promiscuous mem - brane binding of the F - BAR domain . A combination of protein - directed and lipid - directed mecha - nisms may account for this unexpected property of the Nwk Figure 7 .

Under stringent binding conditions and when the protein to lipid ratio is limiting ( e . g . , on GUVs ) , F - BAR domains exhibit nucleation behavior , resulting in favored binding and as - sembly on a small population of vesicles . Importantly , this is a physiologically relevant regime , since cellular membranes and proteins are present in limiting amounts , lipid composition is constantly changing , and F - BARs are acutely released from autoinhibition by regulatory binding partners . Nucleation of F - BAR domains may occur by several potential , nonexclusive mechanisms . F - BAR domains can induce clustering of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ) , which could drive further protein binding and deformation in a feed - forward mechanism . Conversely , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters may form in areas of spontaneous local mem - brane curvature ( Koldsø et al . , 2014 ) , promoting curvature - sen - sitive or properly oriented binding of F - BAR domains . Finally , membrane - bound F - BAR / F - BAR oligomers may increase the propensity for further protein assembly through the effects of avidity . In addition to nucleation effects , our cell - sized water droplet experiments ( which eliminate protein sequestration due to nucleation ) suggest that the Nwk F - BAR domain preferentially deforms membranes with lower negative charge . One mecha - nism for this behavior , supported by our single - particle EM data , is that the F - BAR domain is biased toward a deforma - tion - promoting ( concave - surface - down ) conformation at low PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Another nonexclusive possibility is that at high PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the organization or rigidity of membrane itself may inhibit as - sembly , either by forming lipid clusters of a size that disfavor deformation or by restricting dynamic rearrangements of individ - ual proteins into higher assemblies ( Ruiz - Herrero and Hagan , 2015 ) . Assessing the relative contributions of these forces will require developing a theoretical framework that describes the nucleation , oligomerization , and lipid - binding behaviors of Nwk . Other proteins in the BAR domain family are sensitive to nega - tive membrane charge and may be similarly regulated by nucle - ation behavior and membrane composition . Indeed , elevated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels suppress the membrane deforming activity of the F - BAR protein FBP17 in vivo ( Tsujita et al . , 2015 ) , suggesting that the sweet spot may be conserved feature of BAR domain activity . Further investigation will be required to determine whether BAR domains have different ranges of optimal mem - brane charge , which could contribute to the speciﬁcity of these proteins in the context of their cellular roles . Contributions of Membrane Composition and Autoregulation to the Role of Nwk In Vivo Despite advances in our knowledge of the molecular mecha - nisms regulating BAR domain membrane curvature - sensing and sculpting properties , as well as the effects of their binding partners , we still lack a thorough understanding of how these ac - tivities are regulated and targeted in their cellular contexts . Our data show that Nwk requires both F - BAR activity and the C - ter - minal regulatory SH3 domains for its in vivo role in growth signal regulation at the Drosophila NMJ . Removing the Nwk C terminus produces a more severe phenotype than the null mutant , sug - gesting that constraining and regulating Nwk F - BAR activity and targeting to the membrane via autoregulation is required for proper synapse formation . A critical next step is to consider the role of binding partners in modulating the state of the Nwk F - BAR on the membrane . Nwk interacts with dynamin and the endocytic scaffold Dap160 / intersectin via the SH3a and SH3b domains , respectively ( Rodal et al . , 2008 ; O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ) . These interactions , in addition to localizing BAR do - mains , may modulate Nwk autoinhibition to actively ﬁne - tune membrane binding and deformation at speciﬁc levels of negative membrane charge . Our data also raise an important issue : the physiological signif - icanceofautoregulatorymechanismsdependsnotonlyontheef - fects of Nwk - binding partners on its activity but also critically on the local PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration at which Nwk operates in vivo . A primary deﬁning characteristic of biological membrane com - partments is their lipid composition . BAR domains selectively associate with intracellular membranesrich inchargedphosphoi - nositides ( Becalska et al . , 2013 ; Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Saarikangasetal . , 2010 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentrationshavebeenesti - mated to be (cid:1) 0 . 5 % – 1 % of total cellular membranes , but they are tightly regulated and may transiently accumulate to much higher concentrations ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) . Submicrometer clusters of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 have been detected composed of as much as 80 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Milosevic et al . , 2005 ; James et al . , 2008 ; van den Bogaart et al . , 2011 ) . This suggests that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 exists in cells at a diverse range of concentrations that are dynamically altered by phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases . Local , regulated changes in lipid composition could shift membrane - bound Nwk between a disassembled state and an assembled state that is capable of deforming membranes . Using a pharma - cological approach to acutely increase PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levelsin S2 cells , wefoundthat , similartoourinvitroresults , membraneassociation and deformation by Nwk occur at a sensitive range of cellular PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 that is elevated by autoregulation . Further tests of this lipid - directed mechanism of membrane remodeling in the ner - voussystemwillrequirethedevelopmentofnewmethodstovisu - alize endogenous Nwk - mediated membrane deformation and to acutely manipulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels at the NMJ . In summary , SH3 - domain mediated autoinhibition of the Nwk F - BAR domain shifts the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 dependence of higher - order assembly and promiscuous binding of individual dimers to the membrane . We predict that through this mechanism , activating or inhibitory binding partners work in concert with temporal and spatial regulation of negative membrane charge to control membrane remodeling by BAR domains .
