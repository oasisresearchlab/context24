F E - mail : tfukaya @ iqb . u - tokyo . ac . jp Summary Expression of the gap and pair - rule genes plays an essential role in body segmentation during Drosophila embryogenesis [ 1 - 5 ] . However , it remains unclear how precise expression patterns of these key developmental genes arise from stochastic transcriptional activation at the single cell level . Here , I employed genome editing and live imaging approaches to comprehensively visualize regulation of the gap and pair - rule genes at the endogenous loci . Quantitative image analysis revealed that the total duration of active transcription ( transcription period ) is a major determinant of spatial patterning of gene expression in early embryos . The length of transcription period is regulated by the continuity of bursting activities in individual nuclei , with core expression domain producing more bursts than boundary region . Each gene exhibits distinct rate of nascent RNA production during transcriptional bursting , which contributes to gene - to - gene variability in the total output . I also provide evidence for “enhancer competition” , wherein a distal weak enhancer interferes with transcriptional activation by a strong proximal enhancer to downregulate the length of transcription period without changing the transcription rate . Analysis of endogenous hunchback ( hb ) locus revealed that the removal of distal shadow enhancer induces strong ectopic transcriptional activation , which suppresses refinement of broad expression domain into narrower stripe pattern at the anterior part of embryos . This study provides key insights into the link between transcriptional bursting , enhancer - promoter interaction and spatiotemporal patterning of gene expression during animal development . Results and discussion Zygotic transcription of the gap and pair - rule genes plays an essential role in body segmentation of Drosophila embryos [ 1 - 5 ] . Each gene produces distinct spatial pattern with sharp ON / OFF boundary from crude gradients of maternal morphogens [ 6 ] . Positional information encoded by anterior - posterior ( AP ) pattering genes is not static , rather it undergoes dynamic spatial shifting over time [ 7 ] , which is thought to facilitate time - dependent changes in the distribution of regulatory gradients within an embryo . Importantly , recent advent of quantitative imaging methods revealed that transcription is a stochastic process that consists of successive bursts of de novo RNA synthesis in various species including Drosophila [ 8 - 16 ] . Nonetheless , spatiotemporal patterning of developmental genes is highly reproducible within a population [ 17 ] . Thus , question remains to be addressed how precise expression patterns arise from stochastic transcription in developing embryos . To directly visualize transcription dynamics of AP pattering genes at the endogenous loci , I employed genome editing and quantitative live imaging approaches [ 18 - 20 ] . The sequence cassette containing 24x MS2 and SV40 poly ( A ) signal was inserted into the 3´ untranslated region ( UTR ) of target genes using CRISPR / Cas9 ( Figure 1A ) . First , MS2 - tagged strains were obtained for four major gap genes , giant ( gt ) , hunchback ( hb ) , Krüppel ( Kr ) and knirps ( kni ) ( Figure 1B and Figure S1A ) . The length of inserted MS2 cassette is same for all genes , permitting direct comparison of transcription activities of different genes irrespective of the size of transcription unit . Because MS2 signal becomes visible only when elongating RNA polymerase II enters into the 3´ UTR of the gene , measurement of transcription dot allows me to estimate the rate of full - length mRNA production with high temporal resolution . Fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) assay using MS2 probe showed that authentic patterns of gene expression are maintained in genome editing strains ( Figure S1A - C ) . Importantly , they were all homozygote viable , suggesting that engineering of 3´ UTR does not impede either transcription or translation . This is important for the analysis of developmental genes in early embryos because many of them encode sequence - specific transcription factors and are subject to auto - regulation by their own protein products [ 21 - 23 ] . First , expression of endogenous hb was visualized with maternally provided MCP - GFP fusion protein from the entry into nuclear cycle 14 ( nc14 ) ( Movie S1 ) . Integration of MS2 signal in individual nuclei over time recapitulated the formation of sharp ON / OFF boundary with steep gradient around ~ 43 - 47 % embryo length ( EL ) ( Figure 1C ) . To explore the mechanism of pattern formation , quantitative image analysis was performed to determine the total duration of active transcription ( transcription period ) and the mean MS2 intensity during transcriptional activation ( transcription rate ) ( Figure S1D ) . I found that the length of transcription period in each nucleus is sufficient to recapitulate spatial patterning of nascent RNA production including the formation of expression boundary ( Figure 1D ) , while the transcription rate was constant regardless of relative location ( Figure 1E ) . To ask how the length of transcription period is regulated , MS2 trajectories in individual nuclei were analyzed . Nuclei located at boundary region were found to produce sporadic transcriptional bursting ( Figure 1F ; 43 . 3 % EL and 45 . 9 % EL ) . On the other hand , nuclei near the core expression domain exhibited more continuous activation profiles ( Figure 1F ; 39 . 1 % EL and 41 . 3 % EL ) . This trend was clearly seen when analyzed length of every single bursting events in all nuclei at each AP position ( Figure 1G ) , suggesting that nuclei located near the core expression domain produce next burst before clearance of previous bursts to increase the total length of transcription period . Next , I analyzed hb expression at the posterior part of embryos ( Movie S2 ) . As in anterior expression domain , the length of transcription period highly correlated with the total output , while the transcription rate exhibited only moderate correlation ( Figure S2A - C ) . Individual MS2 trajectories of posterior hb exhibited similar transition of bursting profiles along the AP axis ( Figure S2D and E ) . These results are consistent with the idea that the modulation of transcription period is a major determinant of spatial patterning of hb expression in early embryos . Next , I explored transcription dynamics of other gap genes , gt , Kr and kni ( Figure S1A ) . Live imaging analysis revealed that their spatial patterns also arise from the modulation of transcription period as in hb locus ( Figure 2A and B ) . Comparison of individual MS2 trajectories revealed differential continuity of bursting activities between boundary and core expression domain ( Figure S3 ) . Superimposed profiles of transcription period nicely overlapped with spatial distribution of nascent transcripts within an embryo ( Figure 2B ) , while the transcription rate did not ( Figure 2C ) , again supporting the idea that unique expression patterns of gap genes emerge from the modulation of transcription period . Importantly , each gene was found to exhibit distinct rate of nascent RNA production during transcriptional activation ( Figure 2C and G ) , which appears to contribute to gene - to - gene variability in the total output . For example , posterior hb exhibits longer transcription period than kni ( Figure 2B ) , but does not produce proportionally higher level of output since the transcription rate is nearly twice smaller ( Figure 2C and G ) . I therefore suggest that the length of transcription period defines basic spatial patterning of gene expression and the transcription rate contributes to differential output among gap genes . To further explore regulatory mechanism of other key AP patterning genes , transcription dynamics of endogenous head gap genes , orthodenticle ( otd ) , buttonhead ( btd ) and empty spiracles ( ems ) was visualized ( Figure S1B ) . Live imaging analysis revealed that spatial patterns of head gap genes also arise from the modulation of transcription period rather than the transcription rate ( Figure 2D - F ) . Same conclusion was further supported by the analysis of endogenous pair - rule genes , even - skipped ( eve ) , fushi - tarazu ( ftz ) , hairy ( h ) , paired ( prd ) and runt ( run ) ( Figure S1C and S4A ) . Comparison of transcription rates revealed that there are ~ 3 . 1 - fold and ~ 2 . 7 - fold variations among gap and pair - rule genes ( Figure 2G and Figure S4B ) . Among these , rate of hb transcription was found to largely differ between anterior and posterior expression domains ( Figure 2C and G ) . In contrast , rate of gt transcription was similar between anterior and posterior regions ( Figure 2C and G ) . Transcription of gt is driven from the common promoter regardless of the expression domain . On the other hand , anterior expression of hb is driven from the proximal P2 promoter [ 24 ] , while the posterior expression is also driven from the distal P1 promoter ( Figure 3A ) [ 25 , 26 ] , suggesting that differential promoter usage within a same gene mediates switching of transcription rate in response to different transcriptional activators present along the AP axis . Gap genes are typically regulated by two redundant enhancers that can produce overlapping patterns in early embryos [ 27 ] . While previous transgene assay suggested that redundant enhancers foster robustness of gene expression [ 28 , 29 ] or help to increase transcriptional output [ 30 ] , it remains unclear if they can simultaneously interact with target promoter . Anterior expression of hb is controlled not only by classical proximal enhancer [ 24 , 31 ] , but also by newly - identified distal redundant enhancer , or shadow enhancer [ 27 ] ( Figure 3A ) . To visualize the role of shadow enhancer at the endogenous locus , second round of genome editing was performed using hb - MS2 strain to remove corresponding regulatory sequence ( Figure 3A ) . Unexpectedly , live imaging analysis of resulting mutant embryos revealed that hb starts to produce exceptionally high level of nascent transcripts upon deletion of shadow enhancer ( Figure 3B and Movie S3 ) . Time - course measurement revealed that this ectopic activation takes place ~ 10 - 20 min after entry into nc14 ( Figure 3B ) . Importantly , removal of shadow enhancer increased the length of transcription period without changing the transcription rate ( Figure 3C and D ) . These results are consistent with the idea that distal shadow enhancer interferes with gene activation by proximal enhancer to downregulate hb expression at internal region of expression domain . It has been shown that spatial limit of hb expression is determined by the gradient of maternal Bicoid activator [ 24 ] . I found that the level of RNA production at boundary region ( ~ 43 - 47 % EL ) was unaffected by the removal of shadow enhancer ( Figure 3B ) , suggesting that proximal enhancer alone is sufficient for responding to diminishing level of Bicoid , and that shadow enhancer does not impede this activity . Lastly , I analyzed time - dependent shifting of gap gene expression during nc14 . Consistent with previous studies using fixed embryos [ 7 ] , live imaging data captured anterior shifting of transcription activities of Kr , kni , posterior gt and hb ( Figure 4A ) . However , simple accumulation of nascent transcripts over time was found to mask these shifting effects ( Figure 4B ) , which is incompatible with previous quantitative FISH analysis [ 7 , 32 ] . Early Drosophila embryo is characterized by rapid rates of mRNA degradation . Half - life of newly synthesized mRNAs in early nc14 embryos is estimated to be ~ 13 - 14 min [ 33 , 34 ] . Using live imaging data , I simulated effects of mRNA degradation by considering rapid rate of mRNA decay ( t 1 / 2 = 13 min ) . Simulated data augmented anterior shifting of expression domains ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting that both de novo RNA synthesis and degradation rates contribute to dynamic shifting of positional information encoded by the gap genes . Simulated data also suggest that rapid mRNA degradation helps refinement of initial broad expression domain of anterior gt and hb into narrower stripe patterns ( Figure 4C ) . Importantly , hb mutant lacking distal shadow enhancer can only produce static pattern of gene expression even in the presence of rapid mRNA decay ( Figure 4D and E ) . I therefore suggest that transcriptional interference by distal shadow enhancer facilitates dynamic refinement of expression domain in early embryos . In this study , I provided evidence that the modulation of transcription period is a major determinant of spatial patterning of gene expression in Drosophila embryos . The length of transcription period is regulated by the continuity of bursting activities in individual nuclei , with core expression domain producing more bursts than boundary region to increase total duration of active transcription ( Figure 1 , Figure S2 and S3 ) . Consistent with previous results [ 35 , 36 ] , enhancers appear to be responsible for successive induction of transcriptional bursting because removal of hb shadow enhancer specifically altered the length of transcription period without changing the transcription rate ( Figure 3C and D ) . Previous transgene assay suggested that hb shadow enhancer is ~ 2 - fold weaker than proximal enhancer [ 30 ] . Genome - editing analysis in this study revealed that the deletion of shadow enhancer causes ~ 2 - fold increase in the level of total RNA production ( Figure 3B ) , suggesting that interaction between P2 promoter and strong proximal enhancer is competitively blocked by distal weak enhancer to downregulate de novo RNA synthesis and facilitate refinement of initial expression domain during nc14 . Antagonistic relationship of hb enhancers suggests that they do not form common “transcription hubs” for gene activation , which differs from cooperative action of super enhancers in mammalian cells [ 37 - 39 ] . Regulation of hb is also unique from enhancer competition mechanism seen at other locus [ 30 , 40 ] in a point that distal weak enhancer sequesters interaction with target promoter from remote location despite its “topological disadvantage” over strong proximal enhancer . It might be possible that transcriptional interference by hb shadow enhancer helps subsequent recruitment of distal stripe enhancer to the promoter region at late nc14 [ 41 ] . Supporting this view , clear stripe pattern was not observed in the deletion mutant ( Figure 4D and E , Movie S3 ) . This study also showed that the transcription rate is relatively constant across expression domain for all tested genes , which is consistent with previous observation that transcriptional activators and repressors mainly regulate the frequency , but not the amplitude , of transcriptional bursting [ 36 , 42 ] . When compared different genes , each of them exhibits distinct rate of transcription ( Figure 2G and Figure S4B ) . This appears to contribute to gene - to - gene variability in the level of total RNA production ( Figure 2A - F and Figure S4A ) . Transcription rates might be modulated by core promoter sequences because different usage of hb promoter largely altered its activity within an embryo ( Figure 2C and G ) . Recent single molecule FISH and theoretical modeling approach suggested that transcription initiation rates are constant among four major gap genes in nc13 embryos [ 43 ] . It can be possible that transcription rates of gap genes in earlier nuclear cycle are equally “boosted - up” to enable efficient production of nascent transcripts within a short duration of interphase ( ~ 10 - 12 min ) . I suggest that differential rates of transcription in nc14 help to enrich regulatory information encoded by the gap and pair - rules genes for specification of individual body segments in developing embryos .

The resulting fragment was inserted into the plasmid . Image analysis All the image processing methods and analysis were implemented in MATLAB ( R2019b , MathWorks ) . Segmentation of nuclei For each time point , maximum projections were obtained for all 26 z - sections per image . His2Av - mRFP was used to segment nuclei . His2Av images were first blurred with Gaussian filtering to generate smoothed images . Pixels expressing intensity higher than 5 % of the global maxima in the histogram of His2Av channel were removed . Processed images were converted into binary images using a custom threshold - adaptative segmentation algorithm . Threshold values were determined at each time frame by taking account of 1 ) histogram distribution of His2Av channel and 2 ) the number and size of resulting connected components . Boundaries of components were then modified to locate MS2 transcription dots inside of nearest nuclei . In brief , pixels with intensity twice larger than mean intensity in MS2 channel were considered as active transcription dots , and new binary images were created for each time frame . The Euclidean distances between the centroid of binarized transcription dot and all boundaries of segmented nuclei were calculated . Boundary of the nucleus with the smallest Euclidean distance was modified in order to capture transcription dot within a nucleus . Subsequently , centroids of connected components in nuclei segmentation channel were used to compute the Voronoi cells of the image . Resulting binary images were manually corrected by using Fiji ( https : / / fiji . sc ) . Tracking of nuclei Nuclei tracking was done by finding the object with minimal movement across the frames of interest . For each nucleus in a given frame , the Euclidean distances between the centroids of the nucleus in current time frame and the nuclei in previous time frame were determined . The nucleus with the minimum Euclidean distance was considered as a same lineage . Recording of MS2 signal Maximum projections of raw images were used to record MS2 fluorescence intensities . Using segmented regions , fluorescence intensities within each nucleus were extracted . Signals of MS2 transcription dots were determined by taking integral in a 3 x 3 pixel region centering the brightest pixel within a nucleus after subtracting median fluorescence intensity within a nucleus as a background . Subsequently , minimum MS2 intensities were determined for individual trajectories and subtracted to make the baseline zero . Quantification of output , transcription period and transcription rate For each time frame , nuclei with MS2 intensity above the threshold were considered as active using trajectories after smoothing . Threshold was determined for each gene by calculating the 15 % of the maximum intensity across all smoothed trajectories from three independent embryos . Length of transcription period was determined by calculating total active duration for each nucleus . Transcription rate was determined as a mean MS2 intensity during active state using raw trajectories . Total RNA production was measured by taking the area under the raw trajectory . Nuclei were binned into 20 groups by their relative AP position , and mean values were determined for each parameter . Description of burst length For each time frame , nuclei with MS2 intensity above the threshold were considered to be bursting using trajectories after smoothing . Threshold was determined for each gene by calculating the 10 % of the maximum MS2 intensity across all smoothed trajectories from three independent embryos . From each trajectory , duration of every single bursting events was measured . Bursts that persist only for a single timeframe were considered as a noise and excluded from the analysis . Heatmap analysis of instantaneous MS2 intensity and cumulative RNA production For each time point , mean MS2 intensities among AP - binned nuclei were determined using raw trajectories and shown as a heatmap . Newly synthesized mRNAs were considered to be linearly degraded with a half - life of 13 min according to previous experimental measurements [ 33 , 34 ] . Amount of undegraded mRNAs at each time point was calculated using raw MS2 trajectories . For each time point , mean cumulative RNA levels among AP - binned nuclei were determined and shown as a heatmap . False - coloring by instantaneous MS2 signals MS2 signal intensity at each nucleus was measured as described in the previous section . Using segmentation mask , individual nuclei were false - colored with the pixel intensity proportional to the instantaneous MS2 signal at given time in a given nucleus . Resulting image was then colored and layered over the maximum projected image of His2Av - mRFP . Figure Legends Figure 1 . Length of transcription period determines spatial pattern of hb expression .
