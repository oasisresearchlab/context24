Many natural anti - DNA antibodies ( Abs ) have the ability to translocate across the plasma membrane and localize in the nucleus of mammalian cells , frequently leading to cytotoxicity to cells . Here - in , we report detailed intracellular trafficking routes and cytotoxicity in HeLa cells for a single chain variable fragment ( scFv ) Ab , 3D8 , which is an anti - DNA Ab capable of hydrolyzing both DNA and RNA . The intracellular penetration of 3D8 scFv occurred by caveolae / lipid raft endocytosis . The time - course chasing experiments revealed that 3D8 scFv escaped directly from the caveosome into the cytosol and remained in the cytosol without further trafficking into endosomes , lysosomes , endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi , or nucleus . The cytosolically local - ized 3D8 scFv maintained its nuclease activity to hydrolyze cellular RNAs , mainly mRNAs , eventually triggering apoptotic cell death . Our results demon - strate that 3D8 scFv has a unique intracellular trafficking route of localizing in the cytosol , thereby exhibiting cytotoxicity due to its nuclease activity . Keywords .

Introduction In addition to their DNA binding and / or hydrolyzing activities , some anti - DNA antibodies ( Abs ) , prefer - entially found in humans and mice with autoimmune diseases , have been shown to possess the ability to penetrate into living cells , for example the cell penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) [ 1 , 2 ] . Unlike CPPs which do not generally exhibit cytotoxicity , cell - penetrating anti - DNA Abs with DNA - hydrolyzing activity induced apoptotic cell death [ 3 , 4 ] . Even though their cell - penetrating capacity has not yet been investigated in detail , some polyclonal anti - DNA Abs have shown that their DNA - hydrolyzing activity is correlated with cytotoxicity to tumor cells [ 5 , 6 ] . * Corresponding authors .

Thus , similar to CPPs , non - specific electrostatic interactions of anti - DNA Abs with negatively charged cell surface molecules , such as heparin sulfate proteoglycans , have been proposed to contribute to their cell - penetrating activity without cell - type specificity [ 2 , 10 , 11 ] . Despite numerous observations of the cell - penetrating activity of anti - DNA Abs , their specific endocytic pathways are poorly studied . It is likely that one of the endocytic pathways involved in the internalization of CPPs or other protein cargos , such as macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and caveolae / lipid - raft - mediated endocytosis [ 2 , 12 , 13 ] , plays a role in the internalization of anti - DNA Abs [ 1 , 14 ] . Notably , the cell - penetrating anti - DNA Abs reported so far eventually localized in the nucleus of cells , regardless of cells types and effects on a variety of cellular functions [ 14 – 16 ] . Despite the ability of anti - DNA Abs to penetrate into cells , detailed intracellular trafficking routes and cytotoxic mechanisms have not been well studied . Previously , we have reported an anti - DNA single chain variable fragment ( scFv ) Ab , 3D8 scFv , which binds and hydrolyzes DNA without significant se - quence specificities [ 17 ] . In the present work , we investigated the endocytic pathway and intracellular trafficking of 3D8 scFv in HeLa cells , and underlying mechanism for cytotoxicity by 3D8 scFv . Our results demonstrated that 3D8 scFv internalizes by caveolae / lipid raft pathway - mediated endocytosis through initial interactions with heparin sulfate proteoglycans on cell surface and accumulates in the cytosol without translocation to nucleus , thereby inducing apoptotic cell death by its capability to degrade cellular RNAs . To our best knowledge , this is the first report on cell - penetrating anti - DNA Ab which accumulates in the cytosol without further trafficking into the nucleus .

Mouse - originated 3D8 scFv protein was bacterially expressed and purified by IgG - sepharose affinity chromatography , according to the previously described procedures [ 17 ] . The protein concentrations were determined using extinction co - efficients of 1 . 995 for scFv in units of mg ml - 1 ·cm - 1 at 280 nm , which were calculated from the amino acid sequence . Confocal microscopy .

Cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv for the indicated times in the presence of absence of pre - treatment with reagents at 37 8 C . After stopping cellular uptake by adding three volumes of ice - cold PBS , cells were washed twice with cold PBS , fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) , and then permea - bilized with Perm - buffer ( 1 % BSA , 0 . 1 % saponine , 0 . 1 % sodium azide in PBS ) for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) .

In experimenta - tion with endocytosis markers , HeLa cells were co - treated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) and either Alexa 488 - transferrin ( 10 m g / ml ) , Alexa 488 - Ctx - B ( 10 m g / ml ) , or FITC - dextran ( 10 m g / ml ) for 2 h at 37 8 C , prior to cell fixation and permeabilization . In experimentation with inhibitors for endocytic pathways , HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 2 h at 37 8 C with or without pre - treatment of chloropromazine ( 10 m g / ml ) , M b CD ( 5 mM ) , or cytochalasin D ( 1 m g / ml ) for 30 min at 37 8 C , followed by cell fixation and permeabilization . In pulse - chase experiments , HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 2 h or Alexa 488 - labeled transferrin ( 10 m g / ml ) for 30 min at 37 8 C , quickly washed twice with PBS , and then incubated further at 37 8 C for the specified time in the Result section . After washing , fixation , and perme - abilization of cells , images were detected by incuba - tion with FITC - anti - calnexin , anti - 3D8 scFv , anti - caveloin , anti - EEA1 , or anti - 58k Golgi protein fol - lowed by the appropriate secondary Abs conjugated to TRITC , Cy3 , or FITC . In case of nocodazole treatment , HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 2 h , prior to incubation with 20 m M nocodazol for 30 min at 37 8 C and then cultured for 3 . 5 h at 37 8 C . Flow cytometry . HeLa cells grown in six - well plates ( 1x10 5 cells / well ) were pre - incubated in serum - free DMEM for 30 min at 37 8 C and were left untreated or treated with each inhibitor for 30 min at 37 8 C before 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) treatment . Suspended cells with trypsin were treated once more with 0 . 1 % trypsin for 3 min at 37 8 C to wash off the surface - bound protein . After washings with ice - cold PBS once , cells were fixed and permeabilized as per the procedures descri - bed above , “confocal microscopy” . Cells were washed with ice - cold PBS twice , labeled with anti - rabbit 3D8 scFv Ab followed by TRITC - anti - rabbit , and then analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur TM ( BD Biosciences ) . For each test , 1x10 4 cells were analyzed . RNA interference . Small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) oligonucleotides were synthesized at Bioneer Co . ( Daejeon , Korea ) . The mRNA sequences targeted by caveolin - 1 , clathrin , and dynamin - 2 siRNA were 5(cid:4) - AGA CGA GCU GAG CGA GAA GCA - 3(cid:4) [ 18 , 19 ] , 5(cid:4) - AAC CUG CGG UCU GGA GUC AAC - 3(cid:4) [ 20 ] , and 5(cid:4) - GUG GAC CUG GUU AUC CAG GAG CUA A - 3(cid:4) [ 21 ] respectively . An unrelated ( scramble ) siRNA with sequence of 5(cid:4) - CCU ACG CCA CCA AUU UCG U - 3(cid:4) was employed as a control . HeLa cells grown to 50 % confluency on a six - well or 24 - well plate were transfected with siRNA using Lipofect - amine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufac - turer(cid:4)s instruction . After 48 h , cells on six - well plate were used for immunobottings using anti - caveolin , anti - clathrin , or anti - dynamin Ab and fluorescent images in the cells on the 24 - well plate were analyzed with confocal microscopy as described above . FRET - based RNA - cleavage assay . FRET ( Fluores - cence resonance energy transfer ) - based nucleic acid - hydrolysis assay [ 22 ] was carried out to detect RNA - hydrolyzing activity in live cells . HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 2 or 24 h . After washing , cells were transfected with 21 - base length of RNA substrate labeled with 6 - carboxyfluorescein ( FAM ) at the 5(cid:4) - terminus and a black hole quencher ( BHQ ) at the 3(cid:4) - terminus ( that is 5(cid:4) FAM - CGAT - GAGTGCCATGG ATATAC - BHQ 3(cid:4) ) that was generated by M - biotech . The oligonucleotides ( 200 nM ) were delivered by Lipofectamine 2000 trans - fection reagent into HeLa cells grown in a black 96 - well plate . Immediately after transfection , the fluo - rescence intensity was read for 2 h in real - time by a fluorescence detector ( Molecular Devices ) . RNA integrity analysis . Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells , using the Trizol ( Gibco Invitro - gen ) , according to the manufacture(cid:4)s instruction . Aliquots ( 1 – 5 m g ) of total RNA were either directly resolved on 1 % agarose gel or used for first strand cDNA synthesis using PreMix cDNA synthesis kit ( Bioneer , Korea ) and oligo dT primer . From cDNA template , transcripts specific for GAPDH and b - actin were amplified by RT - PCR . The PCR products were then applied to agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining . RNA cleavage assays with purified 3D8 scFv . 3D8 scFv ( 0 . 1 m M ) or HW1 scFv ( 0 . 1 m M ) purified from bacterial expression [ 17 , 23 ] was incubated with total cellular RNA ( 1 m g ) extracted from HeLa cells , in TBS buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 ) at 37 8 C for 2 h prior to detection of hydrolysis . RNase A ( 1 U ) was used as a positive control in the buffers provided by the manufacturer ( New England Biol - abs ) . RNase - free reagents were used in all procedures . Cell viability assays . Cells seeded at density of 5 (cid:5) 10 3 cells / well in 96 - well plates were cultured overnight and then treated with 0 – 40 m M of 3D8 scFv for 48 h . Cell viability was determined using a colorimetric MTT [ 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetra - Cell . Mol . Life Sci . Vol . 66 , 2009 Research Article 1987 zolium bromide ] - based Cell Growth Determination kit ( Sigma ) [ 23 ] . DNA fragmentation analysis . DNA fragmentation was analyzed as previously described [ 24 ] with slight modifications . HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 48 h at 37 8 C ( 5 (cid:5) 10 5 cells / lane ) , and soluble DNA was then extracted from the cells using genomic DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer(cid:4)s guide ( Qiagen ) . Extracted DNA was resolved on 2 % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining . Western blotting . Cells ( 3 (cid:5)10 5 cells / well ) were seeded in six - well plates , grown overnight , and then treated with 3D8 scFv under conditions as indicated in the figure legends . The Western blotting was then per - formed as described previously [ 23 ] . The appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase were used for developing chemilumines - cence ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Results 3D8 scFv translocates across the plasma membrane and accumulates in the cytosol of cells . We inves - tigated the ability of 3D8 scFv to penetrate into cells in human cervical cancer HeLa cells , which have been extensively used as a model cell line for CPPs and anti - DNA Abs [ 1 , 25 ] . The cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv protein ( 1 , 5 , 10 , and 20 m M ) for various periods of time ( 0 . 5 – 12 h ) at 37 8 C , and then treated with trypsin to remove surface bound proteins before fixing and staining cells . After immunofluorescent labeling of 3D8 scFv , the level of 3D8 scFv taken up by the cells was quantified by flow cytometry ( Fig . 1 ) . The inter - nalization of 3D8 scFv increased in a concentration - dependent manner , reaching a plateau after ~ 2 h for the concentrations tested ( Fig . 1A , B ) . The time - course analysis of subcellular localization of 3D8 scFv by confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that it was retained in punctate , endosome - like vesicles in the cytosol between 0 . – 2 h and then diffused through - out the cytosol up to 48 h with little accumulation in the nucleus ( Fig . 1C ) . This is quite a surprising observation because cell - penetrating anti - DNA Abs reported so far eventually accumulated in the nucleus , usually within a few hours of internalization [ 3 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 26 ] . The majority of CPPs , such as Tat and arginine - rich peptides , also preferentially localize in the nucleus [ 2 ] . Efficient intracellular entry and cytosolic accumulation of 3D8 scFv were also ob - served in other human cancer cells , such as of HCT116 ( colon carcinoma ) and U87MG ( glioma ) ( Fig . Supp . 1 ) , suggesting that the cell - penetrating ability of 3D8 scFv is not cell - type specific , as some anti - DNA Abs and CPPs are [ 2 ] . Cellular entry of 3D8 scFv was not observed at all when it was incubated with cells up to 2 h at 4 o C ( data not shown ) , suggesting that 3D8 scFv internalization is an energy - dependent process [ 2 , 25 ] . The next question was : What are the cell surface receptors for the initiation of internalization of 3D8 scFv ? Previous reports have shown that , prior to internalization , positively charged anti - DNA Abs and CPPs have been shown to interact electrostatically with the extracellular matrix on the cell surface through binding mainly to the negatively - charged proteoglycans , such as heparan sulfate [ 2 , 25 ] . There - fore , to explore whether internalization of the basic 3D8 scFv ( pI = 9 . 15 ) is also initiated by electrostatic binding to ubiquitous proteoglycans , HeLa cells were pre - incubated for 30 min with heparin ( 100 IU / ml ) , as a soluble competitor , prior to incubation with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for another 2 h . Confocal microscopy revealed that heparin completely blocked the inter - nalization of 3D8 scFv as well as cell surface binding ( Fig . 1D ) . Complete blocking of 3D8 scFv internal - ization by heparin was also observed in human cancer cells of HCT116 and U87MG ( Fig . Supp . 1 ) . On the other hand , heparin did not affect the translocation of Alexa 488 - transferrin ( Fig . 1D ) , which is internalized by initial interaction with its specific transferrin receptor on the cell surface [ 2 ] . Thus , it is very likely that 3D8 scFv interacts with negatively charged proteoglycans prior to internalization , similar to anti - DNA Ab , F4 . 1 [ 11 ] . 3D8 scFv internalization is mediated by caveolae / lipid raft endocytosis . For the initial periods of internal - ization , 3D8 scFv were retained in the punctate , endosome - like compartments ( Fig . 1B , C ) . To eluci - date the specific internalization mechanism of 3D8 scFv , 3D8 scFv were stained with FITC - labeled intra - cellular trafficking tracers for the three major endo - cytic pathways , such as transferrin ( TF ) for clathrin - mediated endocytosis , cholera toxin - B ( Ctx - B ) for caveolae / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis , and dextran for macropinocytosis [ 2 , 25 ] . Results showed that the 3D8 scFv - containing compartments were colocalized with Ctx - B , but neither with transferrin nor dextran , as visualized after co - treatment of HeLa cells with 3D8 scFv and trafficking makers for 2 h at 37 8 C ( Fig . 2A ) . The internalization mechanism of 3D8 scFv was further investigated using pharmacological inhibitors to interfere with the above mentioned three individual endocytic pathways . The inhibitors were chlorproma - zine to inhibit clathrin - dependent endocytosis by preventing the recycling of clathrin , methyl - b - cyclo - 1988 J . - Y . Jang et al . Endocytosis of anti - DNA antibody dextrin ( M b CD ) to inhibit caveolae / lipid raft endo - cytosis by depleting cholesterol in cell membranes , thus preventing the formation of caveolae , and cytochalasin D to inhibit macropinocycosis by dis - rupting actin microfilaments [ 25 ] . HeLa cells were pre - treated with these specific inhibitors for 30 min at 37 8 C , prior to the addition of 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) . As shown in Figure 2B and C , confocal microscopic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that pre - incubation of cells with M b CD ( 5 mM ) , but neither with chlorpromazine ( 10 m g / ml ) nor cytochalasin D ( 1 m g / ml ) , led to a significant reduction in the amount of 3D8 scFv internalized . These results strongly indicated that 3D8 scFv is internalized via caveolae / lipid raft - medi - ated endocytosis , in a way similar to that of anti - DNA mAb H7 [ 14 ] . Next , we carried out knock - down experiments of genes involved in the caveolae / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis using siRNA techniques . Caveolin - 1 ( cav - 1 ) is an essential component for both the structure and function of caveolae , called a specialized lipid rafts containing caveolin [ 13 ] . To verify caveolin - depend - ency of 3D8 scFv endocytosis , HeLa cells were transfected with cav - 1 siRNA or control siRNAs ( clathrin - or scramble siRNA ) , and incubated with 3D8 scFv for 2 h after 48 h of transfection . Western blotting analysis revealed that cav - 1 and clathrin expression levels were reduced by 50 % and 70 % , respectively ( Fig . 3A ) . Cav - 1 depletion significantly inhibited the endocytosis of 3D8 scFv , compared to that of the control cells treated with scramble siRNA , indicative of the essential role of cav - 1 played in 3D8 scFv endocytosis ( Fig . 3B ) . However , there was no significant effect of reduced expression of clathrin on the 3D8 scFv endocytosis , excluding the involvement of clathrin - mediated endocytosis for 3D8 scFv . Since endocytosis via caveolae is a GTPase dynamin - dependent process [ 27 ] and a dynamin is essential for helping pinch the endocytic vesicle off from the plasma membrane [ 27 ] , we also examined involve - ment of dynamin in 3D8 scFv endocytosis . Figure 3C shows that colocalization of 3D8 scFv with dynamin was mostly seen at the plasma membrane during short time ( 30 min ) incubation , as expected . Dynamin depletion by siRNA transfection completely inhibited intracellular uptake of 3D8 scFv ( Fig . 3D , E ) .

Vol . 66 , 2009 Research Article 1989 altogether with the observations characterized by clathrin - independence , dynamin - dependence , and sensitivity to cav - 1 knock - down and cholesterol de - pletion led us to conclude that the cellular internal - ization of 3D8 scFv is mediated by caveolae / lipid raft endocytosis [ 27 , 28 ] . 3D8 scFv is released into cytosol directly from caveolae / caveosomes . As shown in Figures 1 – 3 , 3D8 scFv internalized via caveolae / lipid raft endocytosis were retained in punctate , endosome - like vesicles in the cytosol , between 0 . 5 – 2 h and then diffused throughout the cytosol with little accumulation in the nucleus . To follow up the intracellular trafficking routes of 3D8 scFv , we carried out pulse - chase experi - ments . HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv for 30 min , washed to remove extracellular bound 3D8 scFv , and then fluorescently costained with Abs against 3D8 scFv and cav - 1 at 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 12 h . Time - course trafficking of both 3D8 scFv and cav - 1 revealed that 3D8 scFv were seen in punctate com - partments on the plasma membrane immediately after 3D8 scFv treatment ( 0 h ) , then traversed toward inside the cytosol up to 2 h together with cav - 1 , and then diffused throughout the cytosol after 4 h , simul - taneously separating completely from cav - 1 signal ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , cav - 1 showed the route similar to that of 3D8 scFv for the earlier period ( 0 – 4 h ) . However , after 4 h of 3D8 scFv internalization , cav - 1 signal significantly disappeared , implying that caveosomes eventually take the degradative pathway of late endosomes and lysosomes . This observation is in good agreement with a previous report that caveo - somes formed by internalization of albumin in human HepG2 cells were degraded after 3 h of internalization by fusion with lysosomes [ 29 ] . However , it should be noted that 3D8 scFv was not degraded at all even after caveosome degradation ( Fig . 4 ) , suggesting that 3D8 scFv escapes from caveolae / caveosome to translocate into the cytosol . Next , we further examined whether the cytosolic release of 3D8 scFv from caveolae / caveosome re - Figure 2 . 3D8 scFv enters the cells via caveolae / lipid raft - mediated pathway .

As uptake by caveosomes is a slower process than that by clathrin - coated pits [ 30 ] , HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv for 2 h or transferrin for 30 min before being fixed and then fluorescently labeled with Abs against 3D8 scFv and EEA - 1 ( early endosomal antigen - 1 ) or lysotracker - red , agent accumulated in late endosomes / lysosomes [ 31 ] . The resulting overlays revealed that the signal of 3D8 scFv merged with only that of cav - 1 , but not with EEA - 1 and lysotracker - red , whereas transferrin that is delivered to early and / or late endosomes before being recycled to plasma membrane was colocalized with EEA - 1 and lysotracker - red , but not with cav - 1 ( Fig . 5 ) . These results indicated that 3D8 scFv escapes from caveosome into the cytosol , bypassing further endosome sortings and degradative lysosomal path - way . Up to 12 h - chase , colocalization of 3D8 scFv with markers for EEA - 1 or lysotracker - red was not seen ( data not shown ) . Previous reports have shown that endosomal vesicles formed by internalization of some CPPs are trans - ported into Golgi apparatus and ER within the cytosol before the release of CPPs from the vesicles into the cytosol [ 2 ] . To determine whether 3D8 scFv in caveolae / caveosomes is transported to endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and / or Golgi before its cytosolic accumulation , time - course chase of 3D8 scFv was Figure 4 . 3D8 scFv translocates from caveloae / caveosome to the cytosol . The time - course distributions of 3D8 scFv ( upper panels , red ) , caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) ( middle panels , green ) , and their colocalization ( lower panels ) in HeLa cells were visualized with confocal microscopy . HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 30 min , washed and then incubated for the indicated times ( 0 – 12 h ) . Following fixation and permeabilization , cells were stained with primary Abs against 3D8 scFv and caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) , and then secondary Abs of TRITC - labeled anti - rabbit IgG for 3D8 scFv ( red ) and FITC - labeled anti - mouse IgG for Cav - 1 ( green ) detections .

Vol . 66 , 2009 Research Article 1991 carried out with the subcellular organelle markers ; calnexin for ER and 58K Golgi protein for Golgi . As shown in Figure 6A , 3D8 scFv was not colocalized with both ER and Golgi markers for up to 12 h of trafficking , whereas control Ctx - B , which is known to translocate to ER from caveosomes [ 13 ] , over - lapped with the ER marker within 2 h of trafficking ( Fig . 6B ) . The effect of nocodazole on the cytosolic release of 3D8 scFv was further investigated . Noco - dazole , a microtubule - depolymerzing agent , inhibits transport of caveolae / caveosomes into caveolin - free carrier vesicles which move rapidly along microtu - bules to eventually reach other subcellular vesicular organelles [ 32 ] . In the pulse - chase experiment , where cells were pulsed with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 2 h , treated with nocodazole ( 20 m M ) for 30 min , and then incubated for another 4 h , nocodazole did not block the divergence of the internalized 3D8 scFv into the cytosol ( Fig . 6C ) . These results indicate that internal - ized 3D8 scFv can be translocated directly into the cytosol from the caveosomes without traversing into cellular organelles and other intermediate vesicles . Internalized 3D8 scFv triggers apoptotic cell death by hydrolyzing cellular RNAs . The prolonged incubation of cells after 3D8 scFv internalization exhibited cytotoxicity . Figure 7 shows the cytotoxicity of 3D8 scFv in human cancer cell lines of HeLa , HCT116 , and U87MG when incubated with various concentrations of 3D8 scFv ( 5 – 40 m M ) for 48 h .

Compared to that of the untreated cells , the viability of three cell lines treated with 10 and 40 m M 3D8 scFv was decreased ~ 50 – 60 % and ~ 20 % , respectively ( Fig . 7A ) . Dying cells became rounded and were detached from the bottom of culture plates ( Fig . 7B ) . However , treat - ment of the cells with 1 m M 3D8 scFv exhibited no significant cytotoxicity up to 48 h of incubation ( data not shown ) . Genomic DNA fragmentation with laddering pattern ( Fig . 7C ) and cleavage of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase - 1 ( PARP - 1 ) ( Fig . 7D ) demonstrated that 3D8 scFv induced apoptotic cell death . Previous reports have shown that cell - penetrating anti - DNA Abs with DNA - hydrolyzing activity also showed cytotoxicity , triggering apoptosis in various cancer cells [ 3 , 6 ] : anti - DNA Abs were internalized and accumulated in the nucleus , leading the authors to postulate that apoptotic cell death was triggered by damage to nuclear DNA [ 3 , 6 ] . Unlike the above cell - penetrating anti - DNA Abs , however , the final desti - nation of 3D8 scFv up to 48 h was the cytosol without accumulation in the nucleus ( Fig . 1C ) . Thus , we hypothesized that cytotoxicity exerted by cytosolic 3D8 scFv was due to its ability to hydrolyze cytosolic RNAs , since many DNA - hydrolyzing Abs can also hydrolyze RNA [ 33 ] and some ribonucleases ( RNas - es ) give rise to cell toxicity when they are internalized into the cytosol [ 19 , 34 ] . RNA - hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 scFv endocytosed in live cells was analyzed by FRET - based cleavage assay [ 22 ] , in which the hydrolysis of the transfected ribonucleotides , that are double - labeled with a fluo - rophore at 5(cid:4) - terminus and its quencher at 3(cid:4) - termi - nus , can be read out with the increase in fluorescence intensity of the cells . HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 2 or 24 h , prior to transfection with double - labeled RNA substrate , and the intensity of fluorescence in the cells was measured in real - time for 2 h with 5 - minute intervals by a fluorescence analyzer ( Fig . 8A ) . Compared with untreated cells , cells treated with 3D8 scFv for 24 h , but not for 2 h , exhibited RNA - hydrolyzing activity . These results suggest that internalized 3D8 scFv does not exert RNA degradation until its release from its carrier caveolae / caveosomes into the cytosol ( > 2 h , Fig . 1 ) and maintains its nuclease ability even in the reducing environment of the cytosol . The ability of cytosolic 3D8 scFv to hydrolyze exogenous RNA substrate prompted us to investigate its hydrolyzing activity of cellular RNAs . After HeLa cells were incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 10 m M ) for 24 h , the total cellular RNA was isolated and electrophor - etically resolved on 1 % denaturing agarose gels . Integrity of 28S or 18S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) appeared to be intact , evidenced by ethidium bromide staining of the gel ( Fig . 8B ) , indicating that rRNAs were not degraded by 3D8 scFv . To assess the damage Figure 7 . Endocytosed 3D8 scFv induces apoptotic cell death .

Cell . Mol . Life Sci . Vol . 66 , 2009 Research Article 1993 to mRNA by 3D8 scFv , the abundance of mRNAs of two house - keeping genes , GAPDH and b - actin , was analyzed by RT - PCR using gene - specific primers after cDNA synthesis from the same total cellular RNA isolates . The losses of GAPDH and b - actin mRNAs were clearly detected , since the relative abundance of GAPDH and b - actin mRNAs was decreased com - pletely to 0 % and partially to 60 % of the control cells , respectively ( Fig . 8C ) . These results indicate that cellular mRNAs were sensitive to endocytosed 3D8 scFv in vivo , compared to rRNAs . Intense degradation of rRNA ( 28S and 18S ) was observed when rRNA purified from cells was incubated with 3D8 scFv ( 0 . 1 m M ) in a test tube , but not when incubated with HW1 scFv , which is an irrelevant scFv purified from bacterial cells [ 23 ] using exactly the same procedures ( Fig . 8D ) , confirming that 3D8 scFv possessed the RNase activity . Taken altogether , it is most likely that cytosolic 3D8 scFv that has escaped from its carrier caveolae / caveosomes hydrolyzes cellular RNAs , mainly mRNAs , leading to apoptotic cell death in various cancer cells . Discussion Many anti - DNA Abs have been shown to have cell - penetrating activity ; however , their specific endocytic pathways have not been studied in detail , except anti - DNA mAb H7 , which was internalized by caveolar endocytosis [ 14 ] , as was 3D8 scFv . Caveolae , which are ubiquitously present in many vertebrate cell types , are generated by caveolin oligomerization and associa - tion of caveolin with cholesterol - rich lipid - raft do - Figure 8 .

Jang et al . Endocytosis of anti - DNA antibody mains [ 13 ] . Caveolar vesicles budded from the plasma membrane can recycle back to the plasma membrane or fuse with caveosomes and / or early endosomes for delivery to various subcellular organelles ( e . g . , late endosomes , ER , and / or Golgi ) [ 12 , 13 ] . Caveosomes are non - degradative endosomal compartments with neutral pH and contain a caveolae marker ( cav - 1 ) , lacking classic endosomal markers [ 13 , 28 ] . SV40 virus and Ctx - B are well - known for their caveolar endocy - tosis and then merging with caveosome before further sorting to ER and / or Golgi [ 13 , 28 , 32 ] . 3D8 scFv internalized by caveolar endocytosis was colocalized with Ctx - B ( Fig . 2A ) , indicating that a 3D8 scFv - containing caveolae vesicle fuses with caveosome . However , unlike Ctx - B ( Fig . 6B ) and SV40 [ 32 ] , 3D8 scFv - containing caveolae / caveosomes did not trans - locate to early endosomes , late endosome / lysosomes ( Fig . 5 ) , ER or Golgi ( Fig . 6A ) . Instead , 3D8 scFv appeared to escape directly into the cytosol from the caveolae / caveosome compartments before their deg - radation ( Fig . 4 ) . Notably , to the best of our knowl - edge , the cargos that directly translocate to the cytosol from caveolae / caveosome have not yet been reported . For anti - DNA mAb H7 , its direct release from caveosomes to the cytosol before entering into the nucleus was proposed , but detailed trafficking studies were not performed [ 14 ] . Ctx - B and albumin are known as representative proteins internalized via caveolae , upon binding to a lipid - based receptor sphingolipid GM1 and albumin - binding adaptor pro - tein ( gp60 ) at plasma membrane , respectively . How - ever , their post - caveosomal trafficking has not been well described , except for several studies showing that Ctx - B is transported to the Golgi complex ( Fig . 6B ) , possibly through early endosomes [ 12 , 27 , 30 ] . An - other interesting observation in the present study is microtubule - independency for the translocation of 3D8 scFv from the caveolae / caveosome into the cytosol ( Fig . 6C ) . Previously nocodazole , a micro - tubule depolymerizing agent , was found to confine SV40 in caveolae / caveosome compartments , inhibit - ing its further trafficking into ER [ 32 ] . Escape of some CPPs or viruses from early / late endosomes into the cytosol before its merging with lysosomes depends on acidification of endosomes . The acidic pH in the endosome alters the conformation of the CPPs or the N - terminal region of influenza virus hemagglutinin - 2 ( HA2 ) to induce destabilization of lipid membranes , facilitating the escape from the endosomes into the cytosol [ 35 ] . At this point , the exact mechanism of how 3D8 scFv escapes from caveolae / caveosome compartments into the cytosol , while maintaining its biochemical activity , is not clear . However , at least the feature of neutral pH in the lumen of caveolae / caveosome compartments , distin - guished from early / late endosomes , could exclude the possibility that 3D8 scFv escapes from caveolae / caveosomes into the cytosol by virtue of its conforma - tional alteration in a low pH environment . There are , however , two possibilities : one is 3D8 scFv - containing caveolae / caveosomes recruit some proteins , which eventually destabilize to lyse the vesicles before its further trafficking into lysosomes , Golgi and / or ER . Recruiting some enzymes into caveosomes has been reported for glypican - 1 - containing caveosomes , such as heparanase , although how this is achieved is not well understood [ 36 ] . The other possibility is direct lysis of caveolae / caveosomes by 3D8 scFv . As descri - bed earlier , caveolae / caveosomes are mainly com - posed of caveolin and cholesterol - rich lipid - raft domains , where caveolin interactions with cholesterol through the conserved cationic and hydrophobic residues in the N - terminus of caveolin is important for the vesicle stability [ 13 , 28 ] . Therefore , we can assume that 3D8 scFv with multiple basic residues is likely to interfere with the interactions between cholesterol and caveolin , thereby inducing disassem - bly of the vesicles . However , the detailed molecular basis of 3D8 scFv escape from the caveolae / caveo - somes remains to be determined . All of the cell - penetrating anti - DNA Abs reported so far are preferentially localized in the nucleus , similar to CPPs or CPP - conjugated proteins [ 2 ] . Common features of anti - DNA Abs that have a large number of positively - charged residues within CDRs of VH and / or VL domains due to their antigen binding proper - ties , which resemble nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , have been attributed to their final accumulation within the nucleus of cells , like the CPPs [ 2 , 7 ] . Peptides derived from CDRs of human or mouse anti - DNA Abs have been employed as a cell - penetrating carrier for nuclear delivery of plasmids or proteins [ 37 – 39 ] . However , 3D8 scFv was not translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus , remaining in the cytosol even up to 48 h after internalization . 3D8 scFv also has a large number of cationic amino acids in the VH - and VL - CDRs ( total 4 Arg and 4 Lys residues ) [ 17 ] . Three - dimensional structural analysis of the surface which is exposed to CDRs of 3D8 scFv reveals two patches clustered with basic amino acids ; one is on VH - CDR3 ( Arg94 , Lys98 , and Arg99 in Kabat numbering ) and the other is on VL - CDR1 ( Arg27 f , Arg28 , and Lys29 ) [ 17 ] . Therefore , it is not clear why 3D8 scFv remained in the cytosol , although it shares common features of continuous or conformational clustering of basic amino acids with other cell - penetrating anti - DNA Abs or CPPs . 3D8 scFv binds to and hydrolyzes DNA and RNA without sequence specificity , but not proteins [ 17 ] . Accordingly , it is quite possible that 3D8 scFv binds to cytosolic RNAs Cell . Mol . Life Sci . Vol . 66 , 2009 Research Article 1995 without sequence specificity , which may block further trafficking of 3D8 scFv into the nucleus . No exact recognition motifs for nuclear transportation were found in 3D8 scFv when its amino acid sequence was analyzed by sequence alignments with those of well - known NLSs existing on many nuclear - transporting proteins . Thus , another possibility could be attributed to the absence of primary and three - dimensional structural recognition motif for nuclear transportation in 3D8 scFv . Nuclear localization of anti - DNA Abs with a DNA - hydrolyzing property has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in a variety of cells , and the underlying mechanism has been suggested to be damage to nuclear DNA [ 3 – 6 ] . In the present study , however , cell - penetrating 3D8 scFv also induced apoptotic cell death by degrading cellular RNAs , mainly mRNA , but not nuclear DNA , due to their accumulation in the cytosol ( Figs . 7 , 8 ) . It should be noted that some RNAses with cell - penetrating activ - ity , such as Onconase and bovine seminal RNase , also induced apoptotic cell death by damaging cytosolic RNAs [ 34 , 40 ] . The present work shows that 3D8 scFv translocates across the plasma membrane by caveolae / lipid - raft - mediated endocytosis upon interacting with anionic proteoglycans on the cell surface , accumulates in the cytosol , and then induces apoptotic cell death by hydrolyzing cellular RNAs . This is the first report of an anti - DNA Ab that localizes to the cytosol without reaching the nucleus and then induces apoptosis by its RNA - hydrolyzing activity . Besides , unlike previously reported anti - DNA Abs in intact IgG form , 3D8 traverses the plasma membrane in scFv format , lacking the constant regions of IgG , suggesting that the cell penetrating ability of anti - DNA Abs resides in VH and / or VL domain ( s ) . Even though the exact molecular mechanism as to how 3D8 scFv escapes from the caveolae / caveosome into the cytosol is not clear yet , our results suggest that internalization mediated by caveolae may be a favorable pathway for cytotoxic drug delivery because it can avoid lysosomal degradation [ 13 ] .
