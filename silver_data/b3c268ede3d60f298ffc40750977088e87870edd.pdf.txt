Volume 26 December 15 , 2015 4589 MBoC | ARTICLE PLC β 3 mediates cortactin interaction with WAVE2 in MCP1 - induced actin polymerization and cell migration ABSTRACT Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP1 ) stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) migration in vascular wall remodeling . However , the mechanisms underlying MCP1 - induced VSMC migration have not been understood . Here we identify the signaling pathway associated with MCP1 - induced human aortic smooth muscle cell ( HASMC ) migration . MCP1 , a G protein – coupled receptor agonist , activates phosphorylation of cortactin on S405 and S418 residues in a time - dependent manner , and inhibition of its phosphorylation attenuates MCP1 - induced HASMC G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and migration . Cortactin phosphorylation on S405 / S418 is found to be critical for its interaction with WAVE2 , a member of the WASP family of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins required for cell migration . In addition , the MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation is dependent on PLC β 3 - mediated PKC δ activation , and siRNA - mediated down - regulation of either of these molecules prevents cortactin interaction with WAVE2 , affecting G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber forma - tion , and HASMC migration . Upstream , MCP1 activates CCR2 and G α q / 11 in a time - depen - dent manner , and down - regulation of their levels attenuates MCP1 - induced PLC β 3 and PKC δ activation , cortactin phosphorylation , cortactin – WAVE2 interaction , G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration . Together these findings demonstrate that phosphorylation of cortactin on S405 and S418 residues is required for its interaction with WAVE2 in MCP1 - induced cytoskeleton remodeling , facilitating HASMC migration . INTRODUCTION Cell migration plays an essential role in the development of or - ganisms , repairing tissues , and defending against pathogens ( Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ; Stupack et al . , 2000 ) . However , cell migration contributes to several pathological processes as well . To cite a few examples , migration of tumor cells , synovial fibro - blasts , leukocytes , and smooth muscle cells are involved in tumor metastasis , rheumatoid arthritis , atherosclerosis , and neointimal hyperplasia , respectively ( Østerud and Bjørklid , 2003 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ; Gerthoffer , 2007 ; Lefevre et al . , 2009 ) . Vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) migration is an abnormal phenome - non underlying atherogenesis and intimal hyperplasia after an - gioplasty , vascular stent implantation , and organ transplantation ( Clowes et al . , 1989 ; Gerthoffer , 2007 ) . A plethora of molecules produced at the site of vascular injury by dysfunctional endothe - lium or inflammatory cells are involved in the modulation of VSMC migration ( Berk , 2001 ) . Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP1 ; also known as CCL2 ) , in addition to its ability to attract monocytes , memory T - cells and dendritic cells in the mediation of inflammation ( Carr et al . , 1994 ; Xu et al . , 1996 ) , also exhibits potent chemotactic activity toward VSMCs ( Singh et al . , 2012 ; Kundumani - Sridharan et al . , 2013 ) . MCP1 binds to CCR2 and CCR4 , which belong to the superfamily of G protein – coupled re - ceptors ( GPCRs ) , and transmits the cues from cell surface to in - side the cell ( Craig and Loberg , 2006 ; Deshmane et al . , 2009 ) . MCP1 and its receptor CCR2 play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis ( Boring et al . , 1998 ; Gu et al . , 1998 ) and intimal Monitoring Editor Jonathan Chernoff Fox Chase Cancer Center Received : Aug 11 , 2015 Revised : Oct 9 , 2015 Accepted : Oct 13 , 2015 This article was published online ahead of print in MBoC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

Janjanam et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell by which MCP1 induces HASMC migration . Here we show that MCP1 , via activation of CCR2 , G α q / 11 , phospholipase C β 3 ( PLC β 3 ) , and protein kinase C δ ( PKC δ ) , stimulates phosphorylation of cortac - tin at S405 and S418 , leading to its interaction with WAVE2 and promoting actin polymerization and HASMC migration . RESULTS Role of cortactin phosphorylation in MCP1 - induced HASMC migration Cortactin is an actin nucleation – promoting factor and a crucial molecular scaffold for actin assembly and organization , which are necessary for endocytosis , cell migration , and invasion ( MacGrath and Koleske , 2012 ) . Serine phosphorylation of cortactin is important for cancer cell migration ( Kruchten et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , to under - stand the mechanism of MCP1 - induced HASMC migration , we tested the role of cortactin . MCP1 induces serine / threonine phos - phorylation of cortactin in a time - dependent manner ( Figure 1A ) . The S113 , S298 , S348 , S405 , and S418 residues are potential sites of phosphorylation in cortactin ( MacGrath and Koleske , 2012 ) . To determine which of these serine residues are phosphorylated , we mutated each of these serine residues to alanine by site - directed mutagenesis and tested their effects on MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation . Whereas S113A , S298A , and S348A mutants had no effect , the S405A and S418A mutants reduced MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation , suggesting that MCP1 induces phos - phorylation of cortactin at S405 and S418 residues in HASMCs ( Figure 1B ) . To determine whether cortactin mediates actin polym - erization by MCP1 , we immunoprecipitated cortactin from control and 2 - h MCP1 – treated cells and tested its effect on G - actin polym - erization in vitro . The anti - cortactin immunoprecipitates of MCP1 - treated cells exhibited increased G - actin polymerization compared with untreated cells ( Figure 1C ) . In addition , overexpression of S405A and S418A mutants of cortactin prevented MCP1 - induced G - actin polymerization ( Figure 1D ) . Consistent with these observa - tions , overexpression of S405A / S418A mutants of cortactin also at - tenuated HASMC F - actin stress fiber formation and migration ( Figure 1 , E and F ) , suggesting that phosphorylation of cortactin on S405 and S418 residues is required for MCP1 - induced HASMC migration . To validate these findings , we also tested the effect of cortactin small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) on MCP1 - induced HASMC F - actin stress fiber formation and migration and found that down - regulation of cortactin levels prevents HASMC F - actin stress fiber formation and migration ( Figure 1 , G and H ) . Cortactin phosphorylation at S405 and S418 residues is required for its interaction with WAVE2 Although cortactin plays an important role in actin nucleation and polymerization , it requires interactions with other cytoskeletal pro - teins in mediating these effects . Toward this end , we studied its in - teractions with WAVE2 , which also plays an important role in cell migration ( Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation experi - ments showed that cortactin interacts with WAVE2 in a time - depen - dent manner ( Figure 2A ) . To determine the role of cortactin phos - phorylation in its interaction with WAVE2 , we tested the effects of S405A and S418A mutants . Overexpression of S405A / S418A mu - tants of cortactin prevented its interaction with WAVE2 by MCP1 ( Figure 2B ) . In addition , siRNA - mediated depletion of WAVE2 in - hibited MCP1 - induced G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration ( Figure 2 , C – E ) . These observa - tions suggest that cortactin plays an important role in MCP1 - in - duced HASMC migration via its interaction with WAVE2 , promoting G - actin polymerization and F - actin stress fiber formation . hyperplasia ( Roque et al . , 2002 ) , although the downstream sig - naling events of the MCP1 – CCR2 axis are not well studied . Cell migration requires spatial and temporal coordination of cy - toskeletal proteins leading to actin polymerization , and actin polym - erization is mediated by a large number of actin - binding proteins ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2005 ) . Among them , actin - related pro - tein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) , cortactin , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome proteins ( WASP and N - WASP ) , and verprolin homologous protein 2 ( WAVE2 ) play important roles in actin polymerization , which , in turn , facilitates cell migration ( Yamaguchi and Condeelis , 2007 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex is the major component of actin nucleation and mediates actin polym - erization by interactions with cortactin , N - WASP , and WAVE2 ( Mullins and Pollard , 1999 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2001 ; Uruno et al . , 2001 ) . Whereas N - WASP plays a role in filopodium formation ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) , WAVE2 plays a role in lamellipodium formation required for cell migration ( Miki et al . , 1998b ; Takahashi and Suzuki , 2009 ) . Cortactin was initially identified as a Src substrate and later found to be a nucleation promoting factor ( Wu et al . , 1991 ; Uruno et al . , 2001 ) . The basic structure of cortactin comprises an N - terminal acidic ( NTA ) region , actin - binding repeats , a proline - rich region , and an SH3 domain at the C - terminal end . The NTA domain of cortactin interacts directly with Arp2 / 3 to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex and facilitates cell migration by enhancing lamellipodium formation and adhesion assembly ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Bryce et al . , 2005 ) . The fourth actin - binding repeat of cortactin interacts with F - actin to fa - cilitate lamellipodium formation ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , cortactin reinforces the interaction of Arp2 / 3 complex with F - actin by maintaining F - actin networks from undergoing depolymerization ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . The SH3 domain present in the C - terminus binds to proteins such as N - WASP or WASP - interacting protein , which promote actin nucleation and hence actin polymerization ( Kinley et al . , 2003 ; Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . The potential of cortactin to interact with several cytoskeletal and signaling proteins through its SH3 domain also links this protein to various cellular pro - cesses , including invadopodium and lamellipodium formation ( Bryce et al . , 2005 ; Artym et al . , 2006 ) . The capacity of cortactin to interact with many of these cytoskeletal and signaling proteins ap - pears to be regulated by its posttranslational modifications . It was reported that phosphorylation at the Y421 , Y470 , or Y486 residue in the proline - rich domain is required for its role in the development of lamellipodial protrusions and cell migration ( Huang et al . , 1998 ; Wang et al . , 2011 ) . On the other hand , phosphorylation at S405 and S418 by Pak1 and Erks ( Grassart et al . , 2010 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ) is required for its interaction with N - WASP in activating the Arp2 / 3 complex , leading to actin polymerization and lamellipodium forma - tion ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ) . Cortactin can also be phosphorylated at S113 by Pak3 and S298 / 348 by protein kinase D ( Webb et al . , 2006 ; Eiseler et al . , 2010 ) . However , although S113 and S298 phosphorylations of cortactin have been shown to exert a negative effect on actin polymerization and cell migration , the role of S348 phosphorylation is unclear ( Webb et al . , 2006 ; Eiseler et al . , 2010 ) . In addition to phosphorylation , deacetylation of cortactin by HDACs is required for its interaction with F - actin and cell migration ( Zhang et al . , 2007 , 2009 ) . In previous studies , we re - ported that MCP1 mediates VSMC migration and proliferation ( Potula et al . , 2009 ; Singh et al . , 2011 ) . We also reported that MCP1 induces HASMC F - actin stress fiber formation , migration , and prolif - eration via activation of NFATc1 - mediated cyclin D1 - CDK6 - PKN1 - CDK4 - PAK1 signaling ( Kundumani - Sridharan et al . , 2013 ; Singh et al . , 2012 ) . However , the upstream signaling events of MCP1 in the modulation of HASMC migration are not known . Therefore , in the present study , we examined the role of cortactin in the mechanisms Volume 26 December 15 , 2015 Role of cortactin in cell migration | 4591 prevented MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation , cortactin – WAVE2 interactions , G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber for - mation , and HASMC migration ( Figure 6 , C – G ) . G α q / 11 mediates MCP1 - induced PLC β 3 - and PKC δ - mediated cortactin phosphorylation and HASMC migration To understand further how CCR2 mediates the effects of MCP1 on HASMC migration , we studied the role of G proteins . Treatment with MCP1 did not affect the steady - state levels of G α q , G α 11 , G α 12 , or G α 13 ( Figure 7A ) . However , MCP1 caused a time - depen - dent dissociation of G α q / 11 but not G α 12 or G α 13 from CCR2 ( Figure 7B ) , suggesting that MCP1 activates G α q / 11 - coupled CCR2 receptors in HASMCs . Silencing G α q / 11 using their siRNAs pre - vented MCP1 - induced PLC β 3 activity ( Figure 7C ) . Down - regulation of G α q / 11 also attenuated MCP1 - induced PKC δ and cortactin phosphorylation ( Figure 7D ) . In addition , depletion of G α q / 11 levels inhibited MCP1 - induced cortactin – WAVE2 interactions , G - actin po - lymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration ( Figure 7 , E – H ) . DISCUSSION Many studies have demonstrated that MCP1 is involved in vascular wall remodeling ( Schober et al . , 2004 ; Singh et al . , 2012 ; Kundu - mani - Sridharan et al . , 2013 ) . VSMC migration requires cytoskeletal remodeling ( Gerthoffer , 2007 ) . In characterizing the role of cytoskel - etal remodeling in MCP1 - induced VSMC migration , we found that MCP1 induces serine / threonine phosphorylation of cortactin in HASMCs . It was reported that cortactin binds to Arp2 / 3 and acts as a nucleation - promoting factor to enhance actin polymerization and F - actin formation , facilitating cell migration ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of cortactin on S405 / S418 is needed for its role in actin polymerization and invadopodium and lamellipodium for - mation , which are required for cell migration ( Ayala et al . , 2008 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ) . In the present study , we found that MCP1 in - duces phosphorylation of cortactin on S405 and S418 but not on S113 , S298 , and S348 residues , and overexpression of S405 / 418A mutants prevents MCP1 - induced G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration . These observations indicate that cortactin phosphorylation at S405 / S418 residues is re - quired for its role in MCP1 - induced cell migration . The finding that down - regulation of cortactin levels by its siRNA inhibits G - actin po - lymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration also supports the role of cortactin in HASMC migration . To under - stand the potential mechanisms underlying the role of cortactin in the regulation of MCP1 - induced HASMC migration , we found that cortactin interacts with WAVE2 and promotes actin polymerization . In addition , our results showed that phosphorylation of cortactin at S405 / 418 residues is essential for its interaction with WAVE2 in me - diating G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration by MCP1 . Furthermore , depletion of WAVE2 levels prevented MCP1 - induced G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration . In addition , other studies showed that the C - terminal verprolin homology , cofilin ho - mology , and acidic region domain of WAVE2 enhances the branch - ing efficiency of actin filaments ( Suetsugu et al . , 2001 ) . It was also reported that cortactin in concert with N - WASP activates the Arp2 / 3 complex and enhances G - actin polymerization ( Helgeson and Nolen , 2013 ) . Furthermore , phosphorylation of cortactin on S405 / 418 is critical for its interaction with N - WASP and to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . On the basis of these findings , along with our observations , we suggest that the PKC δ mediates cortactin phosphorylation in MCP1 - induced HASMC migration PKCs are key intracellular enzymes activated by calcium and diacyl - glycerol ( DAG ) , alone or in combination , or independent of both of these molecules ( Mellor and Parker , 1998 ) . To determine the mecha - nisms underlying MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation , we tested the time - course effect of MCP1 on activation of conventional ( α , β , γ ) and novel ( δ , ε , η , θ ) PKCs . MCP1 induced phosphorylation of PKC δ , PKC ε , and PKC θ in a time - dependent manner in HASMCs ( Figure 3A ) . Because the time course of PKC δ and PKC ε phosphory - lation correlated with the time course of cortactin phosphorylation , we next focused on the role of these novel PKCs in MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation . Adenovirus - mediated expression of dnPKC δ blocked MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation and its interaction with WAVE2 ( Figure 3 , B and C ) . On the other hand , ade - novirus - mediated expression of dnPKC ε had no effect on MCP1 - in - duced cortactin phosphorylation ( Figure 3B ) . These findings suggest that PKC δ but not PKC ε mediates MCP1 - induced cortactin phos - phorylation . Consistent with these observations , adenovirus - medi - ated expression of dnPKC δ also attenuated MCP1 - induced G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration ( Figure 3 , D – F ) . To confirm the role of PKC δ in MCP1 - induced cortac - tin phosphorylation and its interaction with WAVE2 , we used the siRNA approach as well . Down - regulation of PKC δ levels prevented cortactin phosphorylation and its interaction with WAVE2 , which , in turn , hampered cortactin - mediated G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration ( Figure 4 , A – E ) . Role of PLC β 3 in PKC δ activation and cortactin phosphorylation in MCP1 - induced HASMC migration Many reports suggest that GPCR agonists activate PLC β s in mediat - ing their cellular effects ( Kelley et al . , 2006 ; Lyon et al . , 2014 ) . To test the role of PLC β s in MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation and actin cytoskeleton remodeling , we first studied the time - course ef - fect of MCP1 on the steady - state levels of PLC β isoforms . MCP1 had no effect on PLC β 1 - 3 levels , and the presence of PLC β 4 was not detected in HASMCs ( Figure 5A ) . Next , using a fluoregenic PLC substrate , WH - 15 ( Huang et al . , 2011 ) , we studied the effect of MCP1 on their activities . MCP1 induced PLC β 3 but not PLC β 1 or PLC β 2 activities in a time - dependent manner in HASMCs ( Figure 5B ) . Furthermore , depleting PLC β 3 levels by its short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) expression plasmid inhibited phosphorylation of PKC δ and cortactin ( Figure 5C ) . Furthermore , down - regulation of PLC β 3 levels using its shRNA suppressed MCP1 - induced cortactin – WAVE2 inter - actions , G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration ( Figure 5 , D – G ) . CCR2 but not CCR4 activation is required for PLC β 3 - and PKC δ - dependent cortactin phosphorylation in MCP1 - induced HASMC migration MCP1 mediates its effects via its receptors CCR2 and CCR4 ( Craig and Loberg , 2006 ) . However , in HASMCs , it is not known which of these receptors mediates MCP1 - induced cytoskeleton remodeling , leading to their migration . Both CCR2 and CCR4 are present in HASMCs as detected by Western blot analysis , and treatment with MCP1 did not affect their steady - state levels ( Figure 6A ) . To study the role of these receptors in MCP1 - induced HASMC migration , we used their antagonists , CCR2A and CCR4A , respectively . CCR2A significantly inhibited MCP1 - induced PLC β 3 activity compared with CCR4A ( Figure 6B ) . On the other hand , MCP1 - induced PKC δ phos - phorylation depended on activation of either CCR2 or CCR4 , al - though preferentially CCR2 ( Figure 6C ) . CCR2A but not CCR4A also 4592 | J .

Furthermore , like CCR2 , down - regulation of G α q / 11 completely inhibited MCP1 - induced PLC β 3 and PKC δ acti - vation and cortactin phosphorylation , resulting in diminished F - actin stress fiber formation and HASMC migration . Our findings are also consistent with previous reports that G α q / 11 directly activates PLC β 3 ( Lyon et al . , 2013 ) . A role for G α q / 11 in endothelial and neu - ronal cell migration has also been demonstrated ( Zeng et al . , 2002 ; Ando et al . , 2010 ) . It is important to note that despite the presence of both the re - ceptors , only CCR2 and not CCR4 mediates MCP1 - induced cortac - tin phosphorylation and its interaction with WAVE2 in facilitating G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration via activation of G α q / 11 - PLC β 3 - PKC δ signaling . However , CCR4 was partially involved in PKC δ activation by MCP1 . Because CCR4 had no major role in HAMSC migration , this observation may indicate that the CCR4 - dependent PKC δ activation might be linked to other responses of HASMCs to MCP1 . It was demonstrated that CCR2 mediates MCP1 - induced VSMC migration and proliferation in neointimal development ( Roque et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , other re - ports showed that CCR2 mediates MCP1 - induced human adventi - tial and eosinophilic leukemia cell migration ( Lee et al . , 2009 ; Si et al . , 2012 ) . MCP1 and CCR2 have also been shown to enhance macrophage accumulation and immune responses in the pathogen - esis of atherosclerosis ( Boring et al . , 1998 ; Charo , 1999 ; Gu et al . , 1999 ) . On the basis of all of these observations and as shown in Figure 8 , we speculate that CCR2 , upon activation by MCP1 , trig - gers G α q / 11 - PLC β 3 - PKC δ – dependent cortactin phosphorylation and its interaction with WAVE2 in the modulation of HASMC migra - tion and thereby restenosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Anti - CCR4 antibody ( AF5207 ) , donkey anti - sheep horseradish per - oxidase ( HRP ) antibody ( HAF016 ) , and recombinant human MCP1 ( 279 - MC / CF ) were from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) .

Anti - cortactin ( 3502 ) , anti - pPKC α / β ( 9375 ) , anti - pPKC γ ( 9379 ) , anti - pPKC δ ( 9374 ) , anti - pPKC θ ( 9377 ) , and anti - WAVE2 ( 3659 ) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology ( Beverly , MA ) . Anti – phosphoserine / threonine antibody ( ab17464 ) was bought from Abcam ( Cambridge , MA ) . Goat anti - rabbit HRP ( 31460 ) and goat anti - mouse HRP ( 31437 ) antibodies were obtained from Thermo Scientific ( Waltham , MA ) . Protein A Sepharose CL - 4B ( 170780 - 01 ) , Protein G Sepharose Fast flow ( 17061801 ) , and ECL Western blotting detection reagents ( RPN2106 ) were from GE Healthcare ( Pittsburgh , PA ) . Human cortac - tin siRNA ( ON - TARGETplus SMARTpool l - 010508 - 00 - 0005 ) , human G α q siRNA ( ON - TARGETplus SMARTpool J - 008562 ) , human G α 11 cortactin – WAVE2 interactions probably intensify the actin branching that is required for MCP1 - induced HASMC migration . In elucidating the upstream mechanisms of cortactin phosphory - lation by MCP1 , we observed that MCP1 activates PKC δ and PKC ε with a time course that overlaps the time course of cortactin phos - phorylation . However , adenovirus - mediated expression of dnPKC δ but not dnPKC ε inhibited MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation at S405 / 418 . Down - regulation of PKC δ levels by its siRNA also in - hibited MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation . These results in - dicate that PKC δ but not PKC ε mediates MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation . Previous reports showed that Pak1 , Mek , or Erks can phosphorylate cortactin on S405 and S418 residues ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Grassart et al . , 2010 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ) . It was also reported that PKC δ interacts with cortactin and organizes actin dynamics in early endosomes ( Llado et al . , 2008 ) . Other reports have shown that cortactin is phosphorylated at S113 by Pak3 and at S298 / 348 by protein kinase D ( Webb et al . , 2006 ; Eiseler et al . , 2010 ) . However , in our study , MCP1 does not stimulate cortactin phosphorylation at S113 , S298 , or S348 . In addition , our findings reveal that MCP1 - induced activation of PKC δ is critical for actin po - lymerization , F - actin stress fiber formation , and HASMC migration . Other reports have shown that PKC δ by myosin light chain phos - phorylation mediates epidermal growth factor – induced fibroblast contractility and motility ( Iwabu et al . , 2004 ) . PKC δ also promotes smooth muscle cell migration by platelet - derived growth factor - BB ( PDGF - BB ) or mechanical stress ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Kamiya et al . , 2007 ) . Another study demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid induces fi - broblast migration via phosphorylation and activation of PKC δ ( Gan et al . , 2012 ) . In view of all of these findings , we suggest that PKC δ via phosphorylation of cytoskeletal or contractile proteins mediates the migration of various cell types in response to different agonists . PLCs are widely expressed enzymes that hydrolyze phosphati - dylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate and generate inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphos - phate and DAG ( Berridge and Irvine , 1989 ) . Because novel PKCs require DAG for their activation , we examined the role of PLC β s in MCP1 - induced PKC δ activation . We observed that MCP1 stimulates PLC β 3 activity with a time course that overlaps the time course of PKC δ phosphorylation . We further discovered that PLC β 3 , via PKC δ , mediates MCP1 - induced cortactin phosphorylation , cortactin / WAVE2 interactions , G - actin polymerization , F - actin stress fiber for - mation , and HASMC migration . Previous studies showed that acti - vation of PLC β 2 / 3 is essential for chemoattractant - mediated regula - tion of PKCs , and loss of both genes prevented PKC activation and T - cell migration ( Li et al . , 2000 ; Bach et al . , 2007 ) . On the basis of these observations and present findings , we suggest that various PLC β s , by activating different PKCs , play an important role in the modulation of cell migration . Many studies suggest that G α or G βγ subunits of Gq / 11 hetero - trimeric G proteins regulate PLC β s ( Smrcka and Sternweis , 1993 ; Biber et al . , 1997 ) . We investigated the role of MCP1 receptors and G proteins in the regulation of PLC β 3 activity . We found that CCR2 but not CCR4 mediates PLC β 3 activity . Although CCR2 couples to various G proteins , including Gq / 11 , G14 / 16 and Gi ( Arai and Charo , 1996 ; Kuang et al . , 1996 ) , in response to MCP1 , only G α q / 11 incubated with pyrene - actin monomers , and the rate of actin polymerization was measured as described in Materials and Methods . ( D ) All of the conditions were same as for C , except that after quiescence , the cells were treated with vehicle or MCP1 for 6 h and stained for F - actin .

The complementary nucleotide over - hangs in the primer sequences necessary for directional cloning are shown in bold letters . The positive constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing . The EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) was used to purify plasmids for all transfection purposes . Transfections HASMCs were transfected with nontargeted control or ON - TARGET - plus SMARTpool siRNA at a final concentration of 100 nM using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . Wherever appropriate , cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs at a final concentration of 2 . 5 μg / 60 - mm culture dish or 5 μg / 100 - mm culture dish using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After transfec - tions , cells were recovered in complete medium overnight , growth arrested for 36 h in serum - free medium , and used as required . Cell migration Cell migration was measured by wound - healing assay using culture inserts ( ibidi USA , Madison , WI ) as described previously ( Singh et al . , 2015 ) with minor modifications . Briefly , HASMCs were seeded onto the culture inserts , allowed to grow for 24 – 48 h and quiesced . Trans - fections , wherever appropriate , were performed 1 d after seeding and quiesced for 24 h . Cell growth was arrested by the addition of 5 mM hydroxyurea at the start of the experiment . Images were cap - tured at the indicated time points using an inverted microscope ( Eclipse TS100 ; Nikon , Melville , NY ) with 4 × / numerical aperture ( NA ) 0 . 13 objective . Wound closure was measured by subtracting wound area at 24 h from that at 0 h by using ImageJ software ( National In - stitutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Cell migration was presented as percentage of wound closure . Immunofluorescence staining Immunofluorescence staining for F - actin was performed as described previously ( Kundumani - Sridharan et al . , 2013 ) with slight modifica - tions .

Molecular Biology of the Cell anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP were used at 1 : 4000 – 1 : 5000 dilution . Blots were de - veloped using ECL reagent , and signal in - tensities were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software . G - actin polymerization Actin polymerization activity was measured by using the Pyrene - Actin Polymerization Kit ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , cell ex - tracts of control and MCP1 - treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti - cortac - tin antibody . The cortactin was eluted from the beads with 0 . 2 M glycine ( pH 2 . 6 ) and neutralized by the addition of an equal vol - ume of 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 5 ) . To measure actin - polymerization activity , stock pyrene - actin was diluted to 2 . 3 μM with actin buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) containing 0 . 2 mM ATP and 0 . 5 mM DTT and stored on ice for 60 min to depolymer - ize the actin oligomers . The actin monomers were collected by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4ºC . The pyrene - actin monomers were mixed with the eluted cor - tactin in a 96 - well plate containing polymer - ization buffer ( 25 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 0 ) . The kinetics of actin polymerization was measured by fluorescence intensity generated by the pyrene release for 1 h in a SpectraMax Gemini XS spectrofluorometer at 355 / 405 - nm excitation / emission . Statistics All experiments were repeated three times , and the data are pre - sented as mean ± SD . The treatment effects were analyzed by one - way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test , and p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . The immunocomplexes were released by heating the beads in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting for the indicated molecules using their specific antibodies . PLC β activity assay PLCglow ( WH - 15 ) fluorescent substrate ( KXTbio , Chapel Hill , NC ) was used to measure PLC β 1 - 3 activities as described in the manufac - turer’s instructions . Briefly , cell extracts containing equal amounts of protein from control and various treatments were immunoprecipi - tated with the indicated PLC β antibody . The immunocomplexes were suspended in 50 μl of reaction buffer ( 50 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid , pH 7 . 2 , 250 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 50 μg / ml BSA , and 0 . 5 % sodium cholate ) containing 10 μM WH - 15 and incubated for 90 min at room tempera - ture with gentle rocking . The reaction was quenched with the addi - tion of five volumes of 10 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid . After centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min , the supernatant was transferred to a 96 - well plate , and the fluorescence intensity was measured us - ing a SpectraMax Gemini XS spectrofluorometer ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) at 344 - nm excitation and 530 - nm emission . Western blotting Equal amounts of protein from control and treatment samples were separated by SDS – PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting for the indicated molecules using their specific antibodies , as described previously ( Singh et al . , 2012 ) . All the primary antibodies were used at 1 : 500 – 1 : 1000 dilutions and incubated overnight at 4ºC .
