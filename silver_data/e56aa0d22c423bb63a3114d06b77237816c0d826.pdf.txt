In the ER , the catalytic subunit of CT is translocated into the cytosol , resulting in toxicity . Using ﬂuorescence microscopy , we found that CT is internalized by multiple endocytic pathways . Inhibition of the clathrin - , caveolin - , or Arf6 - dependent pathways by overexpression of appropriate dominant mutants had no effect on retrograde trafﬁc of CT to the Golgi and ER , and it did not affect CT toxicity . Unexpectedly , when we blocked all three endocytic pathways at once , although ﬂuorescent CT in the Golgi and ER became undetectable , CT - induced toxicity was largely unaffected . These results are consistent with the existence of an additional retrograde pathway used by CT to reach the ER . INTRODUCTION Bacterial and plant protein exotoxins are among the most lethal factors produced in nature . Some act on the cell sur - face by perturbing signaling pathways or by disrupting the integrity of the plasma membrane , whereas others exploit membrane trafﬁc pathways to gain access to their cytosolic targets ( Montecucco , 1998 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 2002a , b ) . A well - characterized toxin of this latter group is cholera toxin ( CT ) , produced by Vibrio cholerae . CT belongs to the AB family of bacterial exotoxins and consists of a pentameric B subunit and an A subunit comprising two polypeptides , A1 and A2 , linked by a disulﬁde bond . The B subunit binds with high afﬁnity and speciﬁcity to GM1 , a ganglioside present in apical membranes of all intestinal epithelial cells . The A1 polypeptide has ADP - ribosylase activity , whereas A2 con - tains a carboxy - terminal KDEL ER retrieval signal . CT ﬁrst binds to GM1 at the apical surface of jejunal intesti - nal cells and then follows a complex endocytic pathway in - volving retrograde membrane trafﬁc through the Golgi com - plex to the ER ( Joseph et al . , 1978 ; Joseph et al . , 1979 ; Lencer et al . , 1993 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ; Orlandi et al . , 1993 ; Lencer et al . , 1995 ; Majoul et al . , 1996 ; Majoul et al . , 1998 ; Fujinaga et al . , 2003 ) . Binding to GM1 associates CT with detergent - resistant mem - branes , presumably lipid rafts ; the CT – ganglioside complex then moves from the plasma membrane to the ER ( Fujinaga et al . , 2003 ) . Other toxins and some viruses also bind to glycolip - ids to enter the ER and cause disease ( Falguieres et al . , 2001 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 , 2002 ; Tsai et al . , 2003 ) . In CT , the A1 peptide is unfolded in the ER lumen and retrotranslocated by the Sec61p complex into the cytosol ( Schmitz et al . , 2000 ; Tsai et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) , where it catalyzes the ADP - ribosylation of the heterotrimeric stimulatory G protein ( Gs (cid:1) ) , permanently acti - vating adenylate cyclase ( Kahn and Gilman , 1984 ; Van Dop et al . , 1984 ; Moss and Vaughan , 1988 ) . The resulting increase in intracellular cAMP ( Schafer et al . , 1970 ; Kassis and Fishman , 1982 ; Kassis et al . , 1982 ) causes net intestinal salt and water secretion , resulting in massive secretory diarrhea ( Spangler , 1992 ) , and changes in cell morphology ( Guerrant et al . , 1974 ; Donta et al . , 1976 ; Barbieri et al . , 2002 ) presumably due to activation of cAMP - dependent protein kinase A ( Diviani and Scott , 2001 ; Scott , 2003 ) . Exactly how the CT – GM1 complex trafﬁcs from the plasma membrane to the Golgi and then to the ER remains unknown . One possibility is that the toxin - GM1 complex is primarily carried to the ER by using a caveolin - dependent retrograde trafﬁcking pathway ( Hagmann and Fishman , 1982 ; Montesano et al . , 1982 ; Tran et al . , 1987 ; Parton , 1994 ; Mobius et al . , 1999 ; Badizadegan et al . , 2000 ; Fujinaga et al . , 2003 ) . Cholesterol depletion , or absence of endogenous caveolin ( Fishman and Atikkan , 1980 ; Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ; Torgersen et al . , 2001 ; Wolf et al . , 2002 ; Fujinaga et al . , 2003 ) , or caveolin depletion by RNA interference ( Nichols , 2002 ) , however , do not completely prevent CT uptake or toxicity , with the exception of the work by Orlandi and Fishman ( 1998 ) who found a complete block in cAMP pro - duction by CT in response to ﬁlipin . It also has been pro - posed that CT may enter cells via the clathrin - dependent pathway , but inhibition of this pathway by chemical or genetic treatments results in only a partial decrease in CT uptake ( Sofer and Futerman , 1995 ; Nichols et al . , 2001 ; Shogomori and Futerman , 2001 ; Torgersen et al . , 2001 ) . A third possible entry pathway not yet directly addressed is the one regulated by the small GTPase Arf6 . This pathway is Article published online ahead of print . Mol . Biol . Cell 10 . 1091 / mbc .

It is also possible that CT shows no pref - erence for any given entry route and instead uses a combi - nation of these pathways to arrive at the endosomal and Golgi compartments . With the goal of determining the relative contribution of these entry routes in CT transport to the ER , we measured toxin transport by imaging ﬂuorescent CT , and toxin - in - duced activation of adenylyl cyclase by scoring CT - induced changes in cell shape while interfering speciﬁcally with clathrin - , caveolin - , or Arf6 - dependent endocytosis alone , or all three pathways together . Inhibition of the caveolin , clath - rin , or Arf6 pathways alone had minimal effects on CT entry , whereas the simultaneous block of entry through all these three pathways lead to a substantial reduction of at least 100 - fold in the steady - state accumulation of CT in the endo - somal and Golgi compartments . Unexpectedly , the com - bined inhibition of clathrin , caveolin , and Arf6 endocytic pathways had minimal effects on CT - induced toxicity . Based on these results , we suggest that an additional route for CT entry that is dynamin and Arf6 independent and of sufﬁcient transport capacity exists to allow toxin access to the ER . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents The following reagents were used : latrunculin A , nocodazole , and wild - type cholera toxin ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) ; methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , genistein , brefeldin A ( BFA ) , forskolin , and 8 - Br - cAMP ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) ; geneticin ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ; and BODIPY FL - C5 - ganglioside ﬂuorescent GM1 lipids ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Cells BSC1 monkey kidney epithelial cells ( ATCC CCL - 26 ) , and Y - 1 mouse adrenal cells ( ATCC CCL - 79 ) were grown in DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium , respec - tively , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM l - glutamine , pen - icillin ( 50 U / ml ) , streptomycin ( 50 mg / ml ) , and nonessential amino acids ( 0 . 1 mM ) . Most morphological studies were performed with the larger BSC1 cells ; Y - 1 cells were used for the toxicity assay due to their fast and striking change in shape after a CT - induced increase in cAMP . For CT trafﬁc studies , cells were grown on coverslips ( 18 - or 25 - mm sterile coverslips ) to 50 – 70 % con - ﬂuence . For live - cell imaging studies of CT access to the Golgi complex , we generated a clone of BSC1 cells stably expressing a chimera comprised of the Golgi sorting signal of galactosyltransferase fused to enhanced green ﬂuores - cent protein ( EGFP ) ( BSC1 / GalT - EGFP ) . We made the expression vector by subcloning GalT - EGFP from the pST - GalT - EGFP ( kind gift from Dr . Jennifer Lippincott - Schwartz , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) into the pEGFP - N1 vector ( BD Biosciences Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) . Transfection Hemagglutinin ( HA ) and EGFP - tagged constructs of the dynamin 1 and 2 dominant negative mutants K44A ( DynK44A ) , respectively , were kind gifts from Dr . Sandra Schmid ( The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) . Hu - man HA - tagged Arf6 ( wild type , T27N , or Q67L ) plasmids were kind gifts from Dr . Julie Donaldson ( National Institutes of Health ) , and Dr . Michel Franco ( Institut dePharmacologie Mole´culaire et Cellulaire , Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque , Valbonne , France ) . Dr Jeffrey Pessin ( University of Iowa , Iowa City , IA ) generously provided plasmids encoding myc - tagged caveolin 1 wild type , and mutants S80E and S80A . Two other myc - tagged mutants of caveolin 1 [ Cav1 ( KSF ) and Cav1 ( DGI ) ] were generated based on previously reported mutants of Cav3 ( Luetterforst et al . , 1999 ) . Brieﬂy , after protein homology alignment of the full - length wild - type caveolin 1 and 3 sequences , Eco RI restriction sites followed by Kozak sequences and start codons before positions K135 or D82 were incorporated by site - directed mutagenesis ( QuikChange ; Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) into full - length caveolin 1 . The resulting N terminus - truncated mutants were cloned into pCDNA3 - myc - his and veriﬁed by sequencing . Dr . Jennifer Lippincott - Schwartz kindly provided a plasmid encoding EGFP - Eps15 (cid:1) 95 – 295 fused to EGFP . The major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I HLA - A2 fused to EGFP ( EGFP - MHC - I ) in its ectodomain was a kind gift from Dr . Domenico Tortorella ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . The EHD1 cDNA ( a kind gift from Dr . Mia Horowitz , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv , Israel ) was fused with EGFP in the pEGFP - C1 vector ( BD Biosciences Clontech ) to obtain EGFP - EHD1 . The rat light chain A1 subunit of clathrin ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1987 ) was fused to EYFP in the pEGFP - C1 vector to obtain EYFP - LCA . All transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN ) , and cells were evaluated 24 – 48 h later . CT Uptake The trafﬁc studies were performed using a mutant of CT , E112D , that is poorly able to catalyze the ADP - ribosylation of substrates ( Jobling and Holmes , 2001 ) . To render CT ( E112D ) ﬂuorescent , this protein was ﬁrst bound to galactose beads , to protect the lysine residues of the GM1 binding domains of CT , and then ﬂuorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 following the instruc - tions of the manufacturer ( Molecular Probes ) , obtaining a degree of labeling of (cid:2) 1 . 2 moles of dye per mole of protein . For simplicity , we refer to the Alexa 594 - labeled CT ( E112D ) as CT ( E112D ) from here on . Functional tests in Y - 1 cells by using ﬂuorescently labeled CT ( E112D ) at very high concentrations ( (cid:3) 40 nM ) demonstrated that this toxin still maintains a low toxicity ( our unpublished data ) , indicating that the addition of ﬂuorophores did not mod - ify the binding and trafﬁc properties of CT . Continuous uptake of CT was performed by loading BSC1 or Y - 1 cells with 20 nM CT ( E112D ) in minimal essential medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 0 . 5 g % bovine serum albumin ( HMEMB ) at 37°C for different times ( 20 – 150 min ) . Cells were washed and ﬁxed or transferred to a live - cell imaging chamber for time - lapse recording . Alternatively , CT ( E112D ) was bound at 4°C for 30 min before removing the unbound toxin and shifting to 37°C . We followed the real - time uptake of CT by replacing the medium in the temperature - controlled chamber with 37°C prewarmed medium containing 30 nM CT . Antibody Staining of BSC1 Cells Cells were ﬁxed in 3 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) , washed with PBS supplemented with 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ( PBS (cid:4)(cid:4) ) , and excessive PFA reactive groups were quenched with 50 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS (cid:4)(cid:4) for 15 min at RT . To prevent unspeciﬁc binding of antibodies , samples were incubated with 2 % BSA in PBS (cid:4)(cid:4) for 30 min at RT . All antibodies were diluted in HMEMB supplemented with 0 . 1 g % saponin . For microtubule staining we used a rat anti - (cid:1) - tubulin monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Oxford Biotechnology , Raleigh , NC ) followed by goat anti - rat Cy3 - labeled secondary antibody ( Jackson Im - munoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) . A puriﬁed mouse monoclonal antibody ( W6 / 32 ; hybridoma generously provided by Dr . Hidde Ploegh , Harvard Medical School ) , which recognizes assembled MHC - I heavy chain - (cid:2) 2 microglobulin complexes , was used for MHC - I - antibody feeding experiments . Staining for the early endosomal marker EEA1 or the AP - 2 adaptor complex was performed with a goat polyclonal anti - EEA1 antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) or a rabbit polyclonal anti - (cid:2) 2 ( produced in our laboratory ) , respectively . The trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and the Golgi matrix were stained with a sheep anti - human TGN46 poly - clonal antibody ( Serotec , Raleigh , NC ) or a mouse monoclonal anti - GM130 ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) , respectively . HA and c - myc epitopes were detected using mouse monoclonal antibodies 12CA5 ( harvested from hybrid - oma cells ) , and 9E10 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , respectively . The antibody – epitope complexes were visualized by secondary staining with Alexa488 , Alexa594 , or Alexa647 - goat anti - mouse antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) . cAMP - dependent Morphological Change Assay A single - cell based cAMP - dependent change in cell morphology assay was used to assess CT - induced toxicity . The assay relies on scoring the dramatic alteration in cellular morphology observed on cells attached to a substrate in response to an increase of intracellular cAMP levels . This assay was devel - oped as a way to indirectly determine the levels of cAMP due to direct or indirect activation of adenylate cyclase ( Kowal and Fiedler , 1969 ; Guerrant et al . , 1974 ; Maneval et al . , 1981 ; Maenhaut and Libert , 1990 ; Ulaner et al . , 1999 ) . Incubations with CT ; forskolin , a direct activator of adenylate cyclase ( Seamon and Daly , 1981 ; Seamon et al . , 1981 ) ; or the cell - permeable cAMP analogues dibutyryl cAMP or 8 - bromo - cAMP ( 8 - Br - cAMP ) elicited similar cell shape changes over the same period ( Nambiar et al . , 1993 ; Dong et al . , 1998 ; Ulaner et al . , 1999 ) . It is presumed that the changes in cell shape depend on the activation of cAMP - dependent protein kinase inﬂuencing the actin cytoskeleton ( reviewed by Diviani and Scott , 2001 ) . Y - 1 adrenal cells were seeded at 20 – 30 (cid:5) 10 4 cells / well on 18 - mm cover - slips for 24 h and transfected or not with different plasmids encoding the proteins interfering with membrane trafﬁc . Twenty - four hours later , the cells were washed with PBS (cid:4)(cid:4) and then incubated with HMEMB medium with different concentrations of forskolin , CT holotoxin ( wild type or E112D mu - tant ) , or CT B subunit for 1 . 5 h at 37°C . Inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis was determined by visual inspection of ﬂuorescent human trans - ferrin ( Tf ) internalized during the last 15 min . Cells were ﬁxed and processed R . H . Massol et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3632 for ﬂuorescence microscopy . Random ﬁelds were imaged , and 100 – 300 cells were analyzed by phase contrast ( all cells ) and by ﬂuorescence ( transfected cells ) microscopy . A change in morphology was scored when the cell looked rounded rather than ﬂat and / or showed long processes . The ﬂuorescent images corresponding to the transfected cells offered a simple and nonam - biguous way to determine their cell shape , particularly in regions of relatively high cell density . Phase contrast images were used to conﬁrm the scoring by using ﬂuorescent images and to determine the effect of any given treatment in the surrounding nontransfected cells ( internal control ) . All experiments were repeated at least four times . Microscopy Data Acquisition and Processing Images were acquired and processed as described previously ( Larsen et al . , 2004 ) . The amount of CT localized in the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) / Golgi compartments was determined within masked regions deﬁned by intensity - based segmentation ( Slidebook , Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO ) . The contribution to CT ﬂuorescent signal originating from the Golgi / TGN was corrected from the signal in adjacent endosomes by determining the spatial correlation coefﬁcients ( r ) of ﬂuorescence intensities in both compart - ments as deﬁned by speciﬁc organelle markers . This correction was per - formed for each time frame of every time - lapse series recorded . The relative fraction of CT localized in the ER was estimated from the ﬂuorescent signal generated within a mask corresponding to the nuclear envelope . About 20 cells per condition were analyzed . RESULTS Vesicles and Tubules Transport CT from the Cell Surface to Endosomes before CT Can Access the Golgi Complex CT trafﬁc was monitored in BSC1 cells by live - cell confocal microscopy by using a nontoxic CT mutant , E112D , ﬂuores - cently labeled with Alexa594 . Although most of the entering CT was found in small vesicles moving from the surface to the cell interior , a fraction was detected in tubules ( Figure 1A ) . The tubules seem uniformly labeled with CT and seem to emanate from the plasma membrane . They are long ( 20 – 30 (cid:3) m ) and dynamic , stretching and retracting and pointing toward the perinuclear region ( Figure 1A , arrow - heads , and Movie 1 in Supplement ) . Most vesicles and tu - bules moved bidirectionally along microtubule tracks , as judged by their colocalization with tubulin ( Movie 2 and Fig . s1A in Supplement ) . Consistent with these results , depoly - merization of microtubules by nocodazole treatment inter - fered with the directed motion of the vesicular carriers con - taining CT and prevented tubule formation ( Fig . s1B in Supplement ) . We determined that these vesicles and tubules carry CT from the plasma membrane to the cell interior by following the entry of the toxin prebound to the cell surface at 4°C . On warming the cells to 37°C , CT occurred in vesicles and tubules ( Figure 1B ) , conﬁrming the endocytic nature of these carriers . It is unlikely that CT induced the formation of the tubules , because similar results were observed by monitor - ing the trafﬁc of Bodipy - GM1 , a ﬂuorescent analog of the CT receptor ( our unpublished data ) . Internalized CT reached the endosomal compartment before arriving at the Golgi complex . Figure 1 , C and D ( plots ) , shows a marked lag Figure 1 . Vesicles and tubules internalize CT to a perinuclear endosomal compart - ment . ( A ) CT trafﬁcs in vesicles ( arrows ) and tubules ( arrowheads ) from the plasma membrane toward the perinuclear endoso - mal / Golgi area ( Movie 1 ) . BSC1 cells were incubated with 20 nM nontoxic mutant CT ( E112D ) labeled with Alexa594 ( red ) at 37°C for 45 min . ( B ) CT enters BSC1 cells via both vesicles and tubules ( arrowheads ) . BSC1 cells were incubated with 20 nM CT ( E112D ) at 4°C for 30 min , shifted to 37°C for 2 min , and then the time course of toxin internalization was recorded ( inset and Movie 3 ) . Nucleus was stained with Hoechst ( blue ) . ( C ) Endocytic tubules con - taining CT ( arrowhead ) extend from the cell surface toward a perinuclear endosomal compartment in close contact with the Golgi complex ( GalT - EGFP , green ) . BSC1 cells were incubated as described in B . Selected snapshots of time course of CT internaliza - tion are shown . The plot shows the time course of CT appearance in endosomes ( red line ) within the indicated area ( red stippled circle ) ; after this brief uptake period , almost no CT reaches the Golgi , including the re - gions in proximity with the tubules ( * in image and green line in plot ) . Colocalization of CT with the Golgi region was calculated by r analysis as explained in MATERIALS AND METHODS . ( D ) CT is ﬁrst transported to endosomes before reaching the Golgi complex . CT ( E112D ) was added to BSC1 / GalT - EGFP cells at 37°C during recording of time lapse . Selected snapshots are shown after 0 , 15 , and 30 min of CT addition . Co - localization of CT with the Golgi region ( stippled box ) was calculated as described in C . The plot shows the continuous accumu - lation of CT in endosomes ( red line ) and Golgi complex ( green line ) . Bars , 20 (cid:3) m ( whole cell ) and 10 (cid:3) m ( cropped areas ) . Cholera Toxin Endocytosis and Toxicity Vol . 15 , August 2004 3633 phase of 10 – 15 min before ﬂuorescent CT can be seen to colocalize with the Golgi marker GalT - EGFP . Cholera Toxin Enters through Clathrin - , Caveolin - , and Arf6 - dependent Pathways To identify entry routes for CT in BSC1 cells , we incubated the cells with this toxin and evaluated the extent of its colocalization with markers speciﬁc for the clathrin - , caveo - lin - , and Arf6 - dependent pathways in ﬁxed and live cells . We observed partial colocalization of CT with the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 at the cell surface ( Figure 2 ) . The clathrin pathway is the main route of entry to the early endosomal compartment . Consistent with the apparent entry of CT via the clathrin pathway , CT was also found in endosomes , colocalizing with endocytosed Tf and with the early endo - somal marker EEA1 ( Figure 2 ) . However , it is clear that this is not the only entry pathway for CT . CT also colocalized with caveolin found at the cell surface and in the perinuclear region ( Figure 2 ) , and with vesicular structures containing Arf6 , EHD1 , and MHC - I ( Figure 2 ) . Together , these static observations are consistent with the possibility that all three of these pathways can mediate CT entry . Indeed , live - cell imaging experiments performed with cells expressing ﬂuo - rescent protein chimeras of the clathrin light chain A ( EYFP - LCA1 ) , caveolin 1 ( Cav1 - EGFP ) ( Figure 3 ) , and EHD1 ( EGFP - EHD1 ) ( our unpublished data ) showed that a frac - tion of CT follows the dynamics of each of these proteins . For example , in cells expressing Cav1 - EGFP we found that CT ﬁrst binds to the cell surface and is then carried by vesicles or short tubular structures containing caveolin that move toward the perinuclear region ( see Movie 3 in Supple - ment ) . Inhibiting All Three Identiﬁed Entry Pathways Does Not Prevent CT Toxicity We assessed the relative contribution of the clathrin - , caveo - lin - , or Arf6 - dependent pathways for CT entry by studying the effects of several inhibitory conditions for these entry pathways alone or in combination . Overexpression of a trun - cated form of Eps15 , Eps15 (cid:1) 95 - 295 , which blocks entry of Tf through the clathrin pathway ( Benmerah et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) , did not block CT internalization as judged by the ratio of ﬂuorescent signal of CT at the plasma membrane to that in the interior of the cell ( Figure 4A ) . Likewise , treatments known to disrupt the integrity or function of caveolae ( Smart et al . , 1994 ; Anderson et al . , 1996 ; Hailstones et al . , 1998 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) , such as incubation with PMA , overexpression of the caveolin mutants Cav1S80E ( Figure 4A ) cav1 ( KSF ) and cav1 ( DGI ) ( our unpublished data ) , or incubation with genistein ( Fig . s6C in Supplement ) had min - imal effects on CT entry . In contrast , expression of Cav1S80E in 3T3L1 preadipocytes prevented CT entry , presumably Figure 2 . Cholera toxin colocalizes with markers of the clathrin - , caveolin - , and Arf6 - dependent endocytic pathways . BSC1 cells were incubated with 20 nM CT ( E112D ) and 50 (cid:3) g / ml Alexa 647 - hTf for 15 min ( top two rows ) or 45 min at 37°C and ﬁxed . Colocalization between CT and AP - 2 , EEA1 , Arf6 , or MHC - I was established by immunoﬂuorescence . Caveolin 1 and EHD1 were tagged with EGFP and transiently expressed in BSC1 cells . Arrow - heads indicate colocalization of CT with AP - 2 ( presumably in clathrin - coated pits and vesicles ) , with EEA1 ( early endosomes ) together with inter - nalized Tf . Representative confocal images from ventral ( top row ) or middle sections of cells ( all others ) are shown . Selected regions ( stippled - line boxes ) were cropped , enlarged , and displayed using an inverted monochrome color scale to aid visualization . Bar , 20 (cid:3) m . R . H . Massol et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3634 reﬂecting differences in cell type ( Shigematsu et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , overexpression of the Arf6 mutants Arf6Q67L or Arf6T27N , mutants known to prevent the GTP / GDP cycle of this small GTPase ( Radhakrishna and Donaldson , 1997 ) failed to block CT entry ( Figure 4A ) . Similar effects were found using Y - 1 adrenal cells instead ( Fig . s8 in Supple - ment ) . Thus , inhibition of single pathways did not impor - tantly affect CT internalization . It is possible that CT simultaneously enters through two or all of these pathways . To test this hypothesis , we inter - fered with two or three of these entry routes at once . We used two distinct methods to simultaneously inhibit the clathrin and caveolin pathways : cholesterol depletion ( Hail - stones et al . , 1998 ; Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Parpal et al . , 2001 ) and overexpression of DynK44A , a mutant defective in GTP loading and hydrolysis ( Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; Vallee et al . , 1993 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ) . We found that depletion of cholesterol by incubation with methyl - (cid:2) cyclodextrin did reduce CT entry ( Figure 4B ) , consistent with previous results ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ; Wolf et al . , 2002 ; Le and Nabi , 2003 ) . The effect of DynK44A overexpression was signiﬁ - cantly less pronounced ( Figure 4B ) ; CT was still able to access the perinuclear region , and more CT tubules oc - curred , apparently emanating from the plasma membrane , which now contained Tf ( Figure 4B ) , caveolin1 - EGFP , Arf6 , EHD1 , and MHC - I ( Fig . s2 in Supplement ) . To inhibit all these endocytic pathways , we expressed DynK44A together either with Arf6Q67L or Arf6T27N . This caused an essen - tially complete block of detectable CT internalization in BSC1 and Y - 1 cells corresponding to a decrease of at least 100 - fold in CT uptake ( Figure 4C and s8 in Supplement ) . These results indicate that all three of the pathways inves - tigated here are able to carry CT to the cell interior , and only when all of them are blocked does CT entry , either into endosomes or into the Golgi and ER become undetectable . Cholesterol depletion slightly reduced the access of CT to the TGN ( (cid:2)(cid:6) 2 - fold ) and the ER ( (cid:3) 4 - fold ) ( Figure 5 ) and had a more pronounced effect on its access to the Golgi complex ( (cid:2) 12 - fold ) ( Fig . s3 in Supplement ) , consistent with previous observations ( Shogomori and Futerman , 2001 ; Fujinaga et al . , 2003 ; Le and Nabi , 2003 ) . In contrast , only the combined inhi - bition of the clathrin , caveolin , and Arf6 pathways blocked the transport of CT to the Golgi and the ER ( Figure 4C ) . Because CT can only access the cytosol from the ER , we used a functional assay ( Maneval et al . , 1981 ; Maenhaut and Libert , 1990 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ) that indirectly measures cAMP levels to verify whether blockade of these three en - docytic pathways also reduces CT - elicited toxicity . To do Figure 3 . Clathrin and caveolin - de - pendent pathways mediate CT inter - nalization . ( A ) BSC1 cells stably ex - pressing EYFP - LCA cells were incubated with 20 nM CT ( E112D ) for 30 min at 37°C , washed , and processed for time - lapse recording . A clathrin - coated pit - like structure , selected from the dor - sal cell surface ( image 1 , stippled - line box , and enlarged in images 2 and 3 ) , containing CT was analyzed with the aid of a kymograph plot for clathrin and toxin content over time ( images 4 – 6 ) . ( B ) CT ( E112D ) was added during the time - lapse acquisition to BSC1 cells transiently expressing Cav1 - EGFP .

Cholera Toxin Endocytosis and Toxicity Vol . 15 , August 2004 3635 this on a single - cell basis , we measured the shape response of Y - 1 cells to CT by observing their characteristic cell re - traction and appearance of long plasma membrane projec - tions caused by increased intracellular cAMP levels ( Figure 6A and Movies 4 , a and b , in Supplement ) . This assay was successfully used to study the trafﬁcking of CT and the effect of different mutations in CT enzymatic activity ( Kowal and Srinivasan , 1975 ; Donta et al . , 1976 ; Donta et al . , 1982 ; Nam - biar et al . , 1993 ; Dalsgaard et al . , 1995 ; Fontana et al . , 1995 ; Wolf et al . , 1998 ; Jobling and Holmes , 2001 ; Morinaga et al . , 2001 ) and of its closely related toxin heat - labile LT - II from Escherichia coli ( Sack and Sack , 1975 ; Donta et al . , 1982 ; Guth et al . , 1986 ; Chapman and Daly , 1989 ; Tauschek et al . , 2002 ) . Toxin - induced shape changes in this assay depend strictly on toxin trafﬁcking from the plasma membrane to ER where the CT A1 - chain retrotranslocates to the cytosol , because neither incubation with 20 nM CT B - subunit alone ( Fig . s5B in Supplement ) nor incubation with an enzymatically inac - tive CT mutant ( CTE112D ) had any toxic effect ( Fig . s8 in Supplement ) . Incubation with forskolin , a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase , used as a positive control in this assay ( Donta and Viner , 1975 ; Donta et al . , 1976 ; Maneval et al . , 1981 ; Ulaner et al . , 1999 ) showed the expected dose - response relationship ( Fig . s5A in Supplement ) . Further conﬁrmation that the change in shape assay reﬂects increases in intracel - lular levels of cAMP was obtained by showing a similar response upon incubation of Y - 1 cells with the cell - perme - able cAMP analogue 8 - Br - cAMP ( Figure 6B ) . Overexpres - sion of mutant proteins that block different endocytic routes does not change the normal morphology of the cells ( Fig . s4 in Supplement ) or their sensitivity to respond to increases in cAMP mediated by increasing amounts of forskolin ( Fig . s4 and Fig . s5A in Supplement ) . This assay shows a dose - response relationship between increasing amounts of CT - and cAMP - induced shape cell changes ( Figure 6C ) . The EC 50 for CT - induced cell shape change in nontransfected cells is (cid:2) 32 pM . As shown previously ( Stearns et al . , 1990 ; Balch et al . , 1992 ; Donta et al . , 1993 ; Lencer et al . , 1993 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ) , extensive disruption of the Golgi complex by treat - Figure 4 . Combined inhibition of the clathrin - , caveolin - , and Arf6 - dependent pathways strongly inhibits CT entry . ( A ) Inhibition of clathrin - , caveolin - , or Arf6 - dependent pathways has minimal effects on CT entry . Representative images of BSC1 cells transiently expressing EGFP - Eps15 (cid:1) 95 - 295 , Cav1S80E - myc , Arf6Q67L - HA , Arf6T27N - HA for 24 – 48 h or treated with 100 nM PMA for 30 min ( treatment known to disrupt caveolae ) are shown . The block in Tf uptake assessed the inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ; inhibition of caveolin - mediated uptake resulted in a 25 % reduction in simian virus 40 infectivity ( our unpublished data ) ; and interfer - ence with the Arf6 - dependent pathway by overexpression of Arf6Q67L resulted in the expected vacuolization of the endosomal compartment ( Naslavsky et al . , 2003 ) . ( B ) Combined inhibition of clathrin - and caveolin - dependent pathways partially inhibits CT entry . Representative images of BSC1 cells treated with 10 mM methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin for 30 min or overexpressing Dyn1K44A - HA for 48 h are shown . Under both conditions , Tf uptake was strongly inhibited . Although the retention of CT at the cell surface increased upon cholesterol depletion , and in less degree by interference with dynamin - dependent pathways , its internalization was partially pre - vented . The number of tubules containing CT increased upon ex - pression of dynamin 1 or 2 K44A mutants , which now contain Tf , Cav1 - EGFP , Arf6 , EGFP - EHD1 , and EGFP - MHC - I ( arrowheads and Fig . s2 in Supplement ) . ( C ) Coexpression of Dyn2K44A and Arf6Q67L or Arf6T27N strongly prevents CT entry and abolished tubule formation . ( A – C ) Representative confocal images from mid - dle sections of cells ( n (cid:7) 40 – 60 ) displayed using an inverted mono - chrome scale to aid visualization . Transfected cells were identiﬁed by imaging EGFP or by staining for the myc or HA epitopes fused to the corresponding overexpressed proteins . In coexpression of Arf6 - HA mutants with DynK44A , we used Dyn2K44A - EGFP . Bars , 20 (cid:3) m . R . H . Massol et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3636 ment with BFA abolished the morphological changes in - duced by CT ( Figure 6A ) and also in cells overexpressing Dyn2K44A together with Arf6Q67L ( Figure 6D ) . We con - clude that the changes in cell shape are a very sensitive readout to indirectly determine increased levels of cAMP . We then used this functional assay to study the effect of preventing CT endocytosis in CT - induced toxicity . Unex - pectedly , coexpression of Dyn2K44A together with Arf6Q67L or Arf6T27N , conditions that reduced the uptake of ﬂuorescent CT to the endosomes / Golgi / ER below the detection limit of the ﬂuorescent assay ( at least a 100 - fold reduction in toxin transport ; see Figure 4C ) , showed little or no effect on the rounding of cells treated with 200 pM CT ( EC 95 ; Figure 6D and Table 1 ) . Moreover , the dose - response curves and EC 50 values of the cells coexpressing or not the Dynamin and Arf6 mutants were almost indistinguishable ( Figure 6C ) . Thus , normal toxicity is still elicited , even though the concurrent block of the clathrin - , caveolin - , and Arf6 - dependent pathways strongly inhibits CT entry and transport to the Golgi and ER determined by visualization of ﬂuorescent CT . DISCUSSION In this study , we ﬁnd that CT enters cells through the clathrin - , caveolin - , and Arf6 - dependent endocytic path - ways and that the simultaneous block of all three pathways strongly inhibits the internalization of CT and its access to the Golgi and ER , as assessed by visual inspection of ﬂuo - rescent CT . The increase in cAMP levels due to CT entry was not affected , however , as determined by the single - cell change - in - shape assay . Our results are consistent with earlier studies ( Parton , 1994 ; Sofer and Futerman , 1995 ; Torgersen et al . , 2001 ; Singh et al . , 2003 ) showing that CT enters host cells via multiple routes level but point to different conclusions . In these ex - periments , perturbations of only one or more endocytic pathway led to a limited reduction in endocytosis and a partial inhibition of CT - induced cAMP production , raising the possibility that the methods used to inhibit endocytosis caused only an incomplete block in toxin uptake by all cells in the assay ( upon pharmacological treatment ) or complete interference but in only a fraction of cells in the population tested ( by overexpression of mutant proteins ) . Here , using a single - cell assay , we ﬁnd that CT can enter host cells via multiple routes , some not yet deﬁned at the molecular level . Thus , it is possible that even a complete block of a single endocytic pathway would never be able to inhibit toxicity entirely . Nevertheless , it remains plausible that a particular cell type might use one pathway in preference to others ( Singh et al . , 2003 ) . The toxicity assay is highly sensitive to CT ( EC 50 of 32 pM ) and has a dynamic range of at least 20 - fold in toxin concen - tration ( between 10 and 200 pM ) . Thus , the assay should readily detect a reduction in the amount of CT reaching the ER as caused by the near complete inhibition of CT transport to the Golgi in cells lacking all three , clathrin - , caveolin - , and Arf6 - dependent mechanisms , of endocytosis . If CT endocy - tosis would only occur through these three routes , then a partial inhibition of 99 % in the amount of CT reaching the Figure 5 . Decrease of cholesterol or interference with dynamin function inhibits CT transport to the TGN and the ER . Transport of CT to the TGN ( A ) and ER ( B ) in cells subjected to different conditions that perturb endo - cytosis was assessed by colocalization of the toxin with TGN46 or PDI , re - spectively . BSC1 cells either express - ing the indicated dominant proteins for 24 – 48 h or treated with nocoda - zole or methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin for 30 min were incubated with CT ( E112D ) for 45 min ( A ) or 90 min ( B ) at 37°C . Transfected cells were identiﬁed as described in Figure 4 . For each condi - tion , representative confocal images are shown ( out of at least 50 cells an - alyzed ) . Selected regions ( stippled - line boxes ) of the TGN and ER nuclear envelope were cropped , enlarged , and displayed using an inverted mono - chrome color scale to facilitate inspec - tion of colocalization . Expression of Dyn1K44A or depletion of cholesterol ( by treatment with 10 mM methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin ) signiﬁcantly reduced CT transport to the TGN and ER , whereas inhibition of single endocytic path - ways had no effect . In contrast , micro - tubule depolymerization ( by treat - ment with 10 (cid:3) M nocodazole ) only inhibited retrograde transport the ER . Bars , 20 (cid:3) m . Cholera Toxin Endocytosis and Toxicity Vol . 15 , August 2004 3637 Golgi / ER ( corresponding to our observations ) should result in a 2 - log increase of the EC 50 as determined by the dose - response curve ( Figure 7 ) . In contrast , our data show that the strong inhibition of all three endocytic pathways has no detectable effect on the toxic response . From these results , we conclude that CT also can enter cells and reach the Golgi and ER through a route that is independent of the clathrin , caveolin , Arf6 pathways ( see model in Figure 7 ) . In favoring this interpretation , it is important to note that the concentration of CT ( E112D ) ( 20 nM ) used for the direct ﬂuo - rescence - based trafﬁc assay was (cid:3) 100 - fold higher than the concentration of wild - type CT ( 10 – 200pM ) used in the much more sensitive functional assay . At these lower concentrations , the amount of toxin internalized was below detectable limits as assessed by direct inspection of ﬂuorescent CT . We also exam - ined toxin uptake by indirect immunoﬂuorescence , increasing Figure 6 . CT toxicity does not require active dynamin - and Arf6 - dependent endocytic pathways . ( A ) Assay for toxicity . Incubation of Y - 1 mouse adrenal cells with CT ( 300 pM ) or the adenylyl cyclase - agonist forskolin ( 10 (cid:3) M ) induces a cAMP - dependent cell shape change characterized by cell retraction , rounding , and the extension of long projections . Pretreatment with BFA ( 1 (cid:3) M ) completely inhibits the CT response . Representative phase contrast images were acquired with a 20 (cid:5) lens . B ) The shape - change assay used to measure CT - induced toxicity reﬂects intracellular cAMP levels . On incubation of Y - 1 cells with increasing concentrations of the cAMP - permeable analogue 8 - Br - cAMP , there is a proportional increase in the number of rounded cells , with an EC 50 value of (cid:2) 70 (cid:3) M and a linear range between 30 and 140 (cid:3) M . At least 500 cells were analyzed per condition . ( C ) Dose - response curves of CT - induced cell shape change . The EC 50 for control cells ( 32 pM , full circles in plot ) , for cells expressing Dyn2K44A alone ( 39 pM ; our unpublished data ) or together with Arf6Q67L ( 40 pM , empty diamonds in plot ) are very similar . At least 350 cells were analyzed per condition . ( D ) Simultaneous inhibition of the clathrin - , caveolin - , and Arf6 - mediated endocytic pathways does not affect CT - induced cell shape change . DynK44A and Arf6 dominant mutants ( similar results were obtained with Arf6T27N ; our unpublished data ) were expressed in Y - 1 cells and toxin function assessed by measurement of cell shape change . Representative ﬂuorescence ( displayed in inverted monochrome scale ) and phase contrast images of cells incubated with medium only , forskolin , BFA in combination with forskolin or CT , and wild - type CT are shown . Expression of these proteins did not alter the normal morphology of Y - 1 cells ( Fig . s4 in Supplement ) , or their ability to change upon increased cAMP ( Fig . s4 and s5 in Supplement ) , where cells were incubated with medium with or without forskolin . Cells also were incubated with Tf to verify the block in the clathrin pathway ( our unpublished data ) . Cells were stained with antibodies speciﬁc for HA epitope tags to identify Arf6 expression . Bar , 20 (cid:3) m . R . H . Massol et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3638 the sensitivity of the morphologic assay by 3 - to 10 - fold . Using this approach , we found no detectable toxin in the ER of cells expressing the dominant negative DynK44A together with Arf6Q67L or Arf6T27N ( our unpublished data ) . Thus , even though the clathrin - , caveolin - , and Arf6 - dependent pathways are the main routes for CT entry , they seem not to be the only ones involved in CT transport to the ER . We postulate that there is an unidentiﬁed endocytic pathway that remains active in cells expressing DynK44A together with Arf6Q67L or Arf6T27N . This would explain why the toxin remains fully active in cells where the three known mech - anisms of endocytosis are blocked . An alternative explana - tion for the mechanism of toxin access to the ER might be based on the direct fusion of the plasma membrane with the ER , a process recently described in phagocytic cells that occurs during early stages of phagocytosis ( Gagnon et al . , 2002 ) . Whether this fusion occurs constitutively in all cells , or whether it is sensitive to BFA , however , remains to be determined . Overall , our data are consistent with the existence of another entry pathway relevant for CT activ - ity that is independent of clathrin - , dynamin - , and Arf6 - mediated mechanisms . Table 1 .

In addition , overexpression of two other dominant negative mutants of caveolin or preincubation with genistein did not protect Y - 1 cells against CT - induced cell shape changes ( Fig . 6A and B ) . Representative ﬂuorescence ( displayed in inverted monochrome scale ) and phase contrast images of these conditions are shown in Fig . 7 ( Supplement ) . Figure 7 . Models for delivery routes of CT to the ER . ( A ) Schematic representation assuming only three routes for CT entry , dependent on clathrin , caveolin , and Arf6 pathways . After arrival of CT to the endosomal compartment , the toxin transverses the Golgi complex and ﬁnally arrives to the ER where the CT A1 peptide is retrotranslocated into the cytosol to increase cAMP levels . Inhibition of these three entry routes by coexpression of DynK44A and Arf6 mutants ( brackets ) reduces CT entry by at least 100 - fold . The expected result is a drastic shift in the dose - response relationship of CT toxicity of at least 100 - fold . ( B ) Schematic representation assuming additional routes for CT entry , besides those dependent on the clathrin , caveolin , and Arf6 pathways . In this model , the drastic inhibition in CT entry due to the coexpression of DynK44A and Arf6 mutants does not affect the yet to be determined trafﬁcking pathway ( s ) used by CT to reach the ER . Under these conditions , transport of CT to the ER is maintained thus resulting in a similar dose - response curve of toxicity .
