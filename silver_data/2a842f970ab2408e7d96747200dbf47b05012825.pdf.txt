Using the Ameri - can Physical Society ( APS ) publications data sets , we ask in this paper how new knowledge is built upon old knowledge . We do so by constructing year - to - year bibliographic coupling networks , and identify in them validated communities that represent different research fields . We then visualize their evolutionary relationships in the form of alluvial diagrams , and show how they remain intact through APS journal splits . Quantitatively , we see that most fields undergo weak Popperian mixing , and it is rare for a field to remain isolated / undergo strong mixing . The sizes of fields obey a simple linear growth with recombination . We can also reliably predict the merging between two fields , but not for the considerably more com - plex splitting . Finally , we report a case study of two fields that underwent repeated merging and splitting around 1995 , and how these Kuhnian events are correlated with breakthroughs on Bose - Einstein condensation ( BEC ) , quantum teleportation , and slow light . This impact showed up quantitatively in the citations of the BEC field as a larger proportion of references from during and shortly after these events . Introduction According to Karl Popper , science progresses through repeated hypothesis testing [ 1 ] . Hypoth - eses contrary to empirical evidence must be rejected , while those consistent with data survive to be tested another day . In this picture of the scientific enterprise , our knowledge of the world around us is always tentative , but becomes more complete over time . On the other hand , Thomas Kuhn believes that the accepted knowledge of a given time is the result of consensus amongst scientists , based on evidences consistent with their theories [ 2 ] . However , when too many conflicting evidences are found , a new consensus can form around new theories in what he called a “paradigm shift” . Kuhn gives special relativity and quantum theory as examples of paradigm shifts . Looking back , we realize these two theories have enormous impacts on how PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0184821 September 18 , 2017 1 / 19 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Liu W , Nanetti A , CheongSA ( 2017 ) Knowledge evolution in physicsresearch : An analysis of bibliographic couplingnetworks .

Anyonewill be able to access these data in the same manner as the authors and the authors did not have any special access privileges that others would not have . we understand the world today . But could there be paradigm shifts of various scales that have also contributed to reshaping our knowledge of physics ? Many historians of science have noted the strongly reductionistic flavor of scientific research in the last couple of centuries [ 3 ] . Starting as natural philosophy , the body of scientific knowledge became separated disciplines of astronomy , biology , chemistry and physics . Within physics itself , we also observe the emergence of high energy physics , condensed matter physics , biophysics , and photonics . These are the results of the splitting of science into more specialized fields . We also observe in parallel the merging of fields , such as the merging of astronomy and physics to give astrophysics , biology and chemistry to give biochemistry , and others “that arose by division and recombination of specialties already matured” [ 2 ] . These developments have been discussed extensively by philosophers and historians of science , but unlike our quantitative understanding of physics , our appreciation for the processes through which we acquired our knowledge of physics remains at a highly descriptive level . Some progress has been made in addressing this problem [ 4 – 6 ] . In particular , the following three papers provide the inspiration for our study . Chen and Redner suggested that long - range connections can form between disparate fields because of the development of “a widely applicable theoretical technique , or cross fertilization between theory and experiment” [ 7 ] . Visualizing the cross cita - tions between neuroscience journals , Rosvall and Bergstrom traced the growth and maturation of neuroscience as a discipline [ 8 ] . Using embryology as a specific example , Chavalarias and Cointet created a phylomemetic network visualization for the evolution of science [ 9 ] . Materials and methods While these previous studies point to the evolution of scientific knowledge , they do not iden - tify the entity that is recognizably ‘knowledge’ , or they do not study the interactions between such objects . To clarify what constitutes knowledge , we start with the bibliographic coupling network ( BCN ) [ 10 ] , proposed by Kessler and used extensively in computer science [ 11 , 12 ] . In a BCN , nodes represent papers , and if two papers share w common references , we draw an edge with weight w between them ( see Fig 1 ( a ) ) . The BCN is suitable for our purpose for two reasons : ( i ) the BCN for a given year consists only of papers published that year and does not change after more papers are published later , so features in the BCN represent the state of knowledge in that year ; and ( ii ) the appropriate collective unit of knowledge is a community in the BCN instead of a few key papers or a journal . The data we used in this study is the APS data set , consisting of about half a million publications between 1893 and 2013 [ 13 ] . To determine the statistical significance of our empirical BCNs ( Fig 2 ( a ) ) , we build a null model for comparison . In our null model , we fix the out degrees and in degrees of all papers ( citing and cited ) , so that we can directly compare the null model to the empirical BCN . We then randomly rewire the edges of the empirical BCN , to get an ensemble of artificial BCNs ( Fig 2 ( b ) ) . If the empirical BCN is obtained purely by chance , its distribution of edge weights should be close to the distribution of edge weights of the ensemble of artificial BCNs . The results show that in the real BCN edge weights are far more heterogeneous than expected from an appropriate null model , suggesting that these weights are meaningful , and not the result of purely random connections . After building the BCN , we applied the Louvain method based on the maximization of modularity , to extract the community structure [ 14 ] . In the Louvain method , we first identify small groups by optimizing the modularity locally on all nodes . Each small group is then treated as a single node , and the local modularity optimization repeated until the modularity cannot be increased by any further clustering . To verify that the communities extracted are really focussed on closely related questions , we check the Physics and Astronomy Knowledge evolutionin physics research : An analysisof bibliographic couplingnetworks PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0184821 September 18 , 2017 2 / 19 Funding : The authors received nospecific funding for this work . Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . Classification Scheme ( PACS ) numbers of members of the communities . Such numbers are provided by the authors to indicate the subfields of physics to which their papers belong . In our case , we only use the first two digits of the PACS numbers , as a balance between accuracy and coverage . To test whether the PACS numbers appearing in the communities could have occurred by chance , we choose one year t , build its BCN , extracting the community structure with sizes { s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s n } , and then randomly assign papers in year t into n pseudo - communities of the same sizes , to remove any potential size effects . For a community of size s , we then iden - tify the largest subset of papers sharing the same PACS number . This PACS number can repre - sent the subfield of the community to a certain extent , and the fraction of papers in the largest subset reflect the homogeneity of the community . The results show that the communities extracted are papers really focused on closely related topics , so we refer to these validated units of knowledge as topical clusters ( TCs ) . Fig 1 .

The papers published in different years are distinct , but they do overlap in their ref - erences . Therefore we use this fact to define a forward intimacy index I fmn and a backward inti - macy index I bmn : I fmn ¼ X i N ð R i ; R t þ 1 n Þ N ð R i ; R t þ 1 Þ N ð R i ; R tm Þ L ð R tm Þ ; I bmn ¼ X i N ð R i ; R tm Þ N ð R i ; R t Þ N ð R i ; R t þ 1 n Þ L ð R t þ 1 n Þ ; ð 1 Þ to quantify how close C tm is to C t þ 1 n .

N ( element , list ) is the number of times element occurs in list , and L ( list ) is the length of list . Both forward and backward indices take on values between 0 and 1 . The larger the intimacy index , the clearer the inheritance relationship between two TCs . In this definition , we assume each citation instance in t will be uniformly distributed over all instances of the same citation in t + 1 , while each citation in t + 1 receives equal contributions from all instances of the same Fig 2 .

In general , this index is asymmetric , i . e . I fmn 6¼ I bmn , because the references are not cited the same number of times in the two years . Take Fig 1 ( b ) for example , to calculate the intimacy indices between ①② and ⑥⑦⑧ , we observe that : N ð A ; R ð ⑥ ; ⑦ ; ⑧ ÞÞ ¼ 3 , N ð A ; R ð ① ; ② ÞÞ ¼ 2 , N ð A ; R ð ⑥ ; ⑦ ; ⑧ ; ⑨ ; ⑩ ; ⑪ ÞÞ ¼ 3 , L ð R ð ① ; ② ÞÞ ¼ 4 , N ð C ; R ð ⑥ ; ⑦ ; ⑧ ÞÞ ¼ 1 , N ð C ; R ð ① ; ② ÞÞ ¼ 1 , N ð C ; R ð ⑥ ; ⑦ ; ⑧ ; ⑨ ; ⑩ ; ⑪ ÞÞ ¼ 4 . There - fore , the forward intimacy index between ①② and ⑥⑦⑧ is I f ¼ N ð A ; R ð ⑥ ; ⑦ ; ⑧ ÞÞ N ð A ; R ð ⑥ ; ⑦ ; ⑧ ; ⑨ ; ⑩ ; ⑪ ÞÞ (cid:2) N ð A ; R ð ① ; ② ÞÞ L ð R ð ① ; ② ÞÞ þ N ð C ; R ð ⑥ ; ⑦ ; ⑧ ÞÞ N ð C ; R ð ⑥ ; ⑦ ; ⑧ ; ⑨ ; ⑩ ; ⑪ ÞÞ (cid:2) N ð C ; R ð ① ; ② ÞÞ L ð R ð ① ; ② ÞÞ ¼ 33 (cid:2) 24 þ 14 (cid:2) 14 ¼ 0 : 5625 . In a similar way , the backward intimacy index between ①② and ⑥⑦⑧ is 23 (cid:2) 35 þ 14 (cid:2) 15 ¼ 0 : 45 . Results and discussion According to the above mentioned methodology we visualize the sequence of TCs and their intimacy indices , the evolution of physics research they represent in the form of alluvial dia - grams . Before that , we first discuss the TC validation results . As shown in Fig 2 ( c ) , in the BCN edge weights are far more heterogeneous than expected from an appropriate null model , This heterogeneity can be explained by the presence of communities that we extracted using the Louvain method . Compared to the null model , the real BCN has more high - weight edges . We suspect these are the most meaningful edges , arising from the paper’s content . If two papers focus on close topics , they will likely have high chance to have more than one common refer - ence , and this effect also manifest itself in the degree distribution : the null model has a flatter degree distribution at small degrees because the edges are drawn by chance , whereas in the real BCN this coupling is based on content , meaning that papers will have edges mostly with papers that are trying to solve the same problems , so the real BCN will have more low - degree nodes , fewer high - degree nodes compared the null model . The most prominent feature of this content - sensitive citation is community structure : in the real BCN , papers focussed on the same topic share more common references with each other than papers focussed on different topics , so that the densities of edges within topics are much higher than between topics . There - fore the modularities of communities extracted by the Louvain method in the real network is much higher than in the null model , as shown in Fig 2 ( d ) . Meanwhile , We also test how likely the most common PACS number in a community of n papers can appear with its observed frequency , within random collections of n papers . The largest subset of papers sharing the same PACS number in a random collection of s papers is typically small . Dividing the sizes of the largest subsets in the empirical communities and in the random collections , we find ratios are larger than 1 for most cases . That is to say , for most communities , this is highly unlikely , so we conclude that the groupings of papers extracted are meaningful . ( see Fig 3 ) . The alluvial diagrams can visualize the sequence of TCs and their intimacy indices , the evo - lution of physics research they represent very clearly . For example , in Fig 4 we can clearly see the birth of PRA , PRB , PRC and PRD from PR in 1970 . Each journal consist of several TCs , which existed even in the PR era . The editorial decision to split PR is consistent with the self - organized TCs even though it was done without classification analysis . We also plotted an alluvial diagram for 1991 to 2000 , showing the splitting of PRA into PRA and PRE . As we can see from Fig 5 , before 1993 , there were several PRA - dominated TCs . After the split in 1993 , some PRA - dominated TCs remained PRA - dominated , whereas other PRA - dominated TCs became PRE - dominated . This means that even before 1993 , papers in PRA were already divided into groups based on different topics , some of which are predeces - sors of the PRE TCs .

Here we showcase one such episode between 1991 and 2000 , involving interesting interactions between quantum optics ( QO ) , quantum information ( QI ) , and Bose - Einstein condensation ( BEC ) . These three fields experi - enced breakthroughs in the 1990s . In Fig 6 we highlight the evolution of TCs that are related to Fig 4 . The alluvial diagram of APS papers from 1965 to 1974 .

At the beginning of the decade , we see two PRA - dominated TCs . Based on the papers they contain , we can loosely associate one with quantum information ( QI ) and trapped atomic ions ( BEC ) , and the other with quantum optics ( QO ) . In 1993 , the QI + BEC TC cited many QO papers , and in 1994 , the QO TC cited many QI + BEC papers . Following this ‘cross - fertilization’ , the two TCs merged in 1995 , the same year Cornell et al . [ 15 ] and Ketterle et al . [ 16 ] published their seminal papers demonstrating BEC in dilute atomic gases . In recognition of their works , Cornell , Wieman , and Ketterle were awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics . The PRA - dominated TC split after 1996 to give one that is exclusively BEC , and another that is Fig 5 . The alluvial diagram of APS papers from 1991 to 2000 .

It was after Zeilinger demonstrated in 1997 experimental quantum teleportation [ 17 ] that the QI + QO TC split into a QI TC and a QO TC . After receiv - ing more influence from other PRB - dominated TC , the QO cluster produced yet another breakthrough paper , in the form of ultraslow light in hot atomic gases [ 18 ] . Without the data visualization done here , few may suspect the existence of such connections between BEC , quantum teleportation and slow light . Some TCs have more references overlapping with those in the previous year , while other TCs have less . To quantify the evolution of references , we sum the forward and backward inti - macy indices for each TC . These represent the percentage of a TC’s references going to the next year , and the percentage of references the TC inherited from the previous year , which we think of as the ‘outflow’ and ‘inflow’ respectively . As shown in Fig 7 ( a ) and 7 ( b ) , most outflows and inflows are distributed within a narrow range , but there are exceptional cases as well : such as a single peak in Fig 7 ( b ) , whose references overlap significantly less than normal with the previous year . In the context of birth , death , growth , decay , split , and merge knowledge pro - cesses , we are inclined to call this event in 1993 the birth of a TC . Further analysis shows that most common PACS codes are : 03 ( Quantum mechanics , field theories , and special relativity ) , 42 ( Optics ) and 63 ( Lattice dynamics ) . Looking at the references of this TC , we find that most of these comes from 1990 , 3 year before . This interesting phenomenon is therefore more appropriately identified as a sleeping beauty [ 19 ] . Every year , physicists absorb new references and drop old references as their fields progress . Although this ‘metabolism’ differ from TC to TC , the whole process is quite stable over all TCs , as shown in Fig 7 ( c ) and 7 ( d ) . This universal curve can be used as a benchmark for the test of scientific impact , as we have done in Fig 8 . From Fig 4 we see a diversity of inflows and outflows from one TC to another : some TCs are derived almost exclusively from one source , others receive strong contributions from a small number of sources , or weak contributions from a large number of sources . To quantify such diversity , we construct a forward mixing degree of community C tm and backward mixing degree of C t þ 1 n analogous to the Gini - Simpson index [ 20 ] : M fm ¼ 1 (cid:0) X n ð I fmn = X n 0 I fmn 0 Þ 2 ; M bn ¼ 1 (cid:0) X m ð I bmn = X m 0 I bm 0 n Þ 2 ; ð 2 Þ which measure the probabilities that two streams taken at random from the TC’s outflow / inflow ( with replacement ) represent different streams . A TC with low forward / backward mix - ing degree has effectively one child / parent , whereas a TC with high forward / backward mixing degree undergoes / results from strong splitting / merging . As shown in Fig 7 ( e ) and 7 ( f ) , neither are frequent . It is more common to find weak mixing between TCs , which we believe is due to most papers citing small numbers of papers outside their fields . At this point , let us recall the Popperian and Kuhnian pictures of the evolution of knowl - edge , where we expect incremental growth punctuated by abrupt paradigm shifts . Certainly , at the aggregate level of PR series of premier physics journals , the number of articles published has grown over the years . When we partition these articles into TCs , we naively expect that some clusters will grow / shrink because of growing / declining interest in their topics . From the alluvial diagrams , we realize that the real picture is far more complex because of recombina - tions between TCs . Therefore , instead of measuring the growth rates of pure TCs , we need to measure the growth of recombined TCs . To do this , we assume that the contribution of C tm to the size of C t þ 1 n is proportional to the size of C tm and also the normalized forward intimacy Knowledge evolutionin physics research : An analysisof bibliographic couplingnetworks PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0184821 September 18 , 2017 8 / 19 Fig 7 .

This tells us that the growth of recom - bined TCs is also Popperian . Next , we consider the Kuhnian processes of splitting and merging . For merging events , the similarity S ð C tm ; C tm 0 Þ ¼ P n ð I fmn = P n 0 I fmn 0 Þð I fm 0 n = P n 00 I fm 0 n 00 Þ ð 4 Þ measures the overlap between the offsprings of the TCs C t m and C t m 0 in year t . If C t m and C t m 0 merge perfectly into a single TC in year t + 1 , S = 1 . On the other hand , if the offsprings of C tm and C tm 0 are distinct , S = 0 . In general , 0 (cid:20) S (cid:20) 1 . The value of S cannot be treated as a “predic - tion” , because we made use of information from years t and t + 1 to compute it . As two TCs evolved from being distinct to merging into a single TC , we expect to find few , low - weight edges between them in the BCN when they are distinct . This sum of weight of edges would gradually increase until the sum of weight between C tm and C tm 0 is comparable to the sum of edges within C tm and C tm 0 . At this point , the two TCs merge . Therefore , to do the prediction , we define T ð C tm ; C tm 0 Þ ¼ W ð C tm ; C tm 0 Þ = ð L ð C tm Þ L ð C tm 0 ÞÞ ; ð 5 Þ where W ð C tm ; C tm 0 Þ is the sum of weights of edges between papers in C tm and C tm 0 , normalized against the sizes of TCs involved . Fig 10 shows that S ð C tm ; C tm 0 Þ and T ð C tm ; C Tm 0 Þ are highly corre - lated . High T ð C tm ; C tm 0 Þ leads with a large probability to a high S ð C tm ; C tm 0 Þ .

However , because the average Pearson corre - lation coefficient is only 0 . 504 , such a relation is not linear ( see Fig 11 ) . We also tried to predict the splitting events . The first factor we considered is TC’s size . We divided all TCs in 1990s into two groups : one for TCs larger than median size , another for TCs smaller than median size . The medians and means for the forward mixing degree in these two groups are very close . Furthermore , the Pearson correlation coefficient between size and for - ward mixing degree is −0 . 031 ( see Fig 12 ) . Therefore , we concluded that a TC does not become more likely to split as it grows larger . The second factor is the TC’s internal structure . Here the situation is more complex : when we use the dendrogram extracted from the Louvain method to identify subcommunities , we found that different TCs have different internal structures ( see Fig 13 ) , some have a few large subcommunities , while others have many small subcommuni - ties . Naively , we expect the criterion for splitting is the opposite to merging , i . e . the easier it is Fig 9 .

Here A ( j 1 , j 2 ) is the weight of the edge between papers j 1 and j 2 , and C i is a subcommunity in the given TC . However the picture we find is not as simple as the merging case . When we plot M f against B , we find the expected decreasing trend , but at the same time , the large scatter makes it impossible to reli - ably predict a splitting event using B . To better understand the relationship between M f and B , we use quantile regression [ 21 ] to find that the B has no “prediction power” when M f is small , but becomes “predictive” when M f is large . That is to say the relation between B and M f depends on the decile , as shown in Fig 14 ( a ) and 14 ( b ) . The slopes show that for the decile of most strongly splitting TCs , increasing the standardized B by one standard deviation will decrease M f by about 0 . 05 , whereas for the decile of the least strongly splitting TCs , there is no obvious trend . We also define a fragmentation index F ¼ X i : j ½ i (cid:138) w i S 2 j ½ i (cid:138) ð 7 Þ where w i is the size fraction of the top level subcommunity i , s j [ i ] is the relative size fraction of subsubcommunity j inside subcommunity i . The more fragmented a community is , i . e . , more and smaller subcommunities , the closer F is to 0 . Quantile regression between F and M f gives very similar results as B and M f , i . e . , for the decile of most strongly splitting TCs , increasing the standardized F by one standard deviation will decrease M f by about 0 . 06 , whereas for the decile Fig 10 .

Finally , we want to know the impacts of such merging and splitting events . We first check for an increase in the number of publications after such events , but found an insignificant dif - ference in paper numbers in strongly and weakly mixing TCs ( see Fig 9 ( b ) and 9 ( c ) ) . We sus - pected this is because our data set is confined to the APS publications , and a more careful check should include other physics journals to capture any “influence spillover” . When we think of high - impact research , we also think of highly - cited papers . Therefore , to quantify the impact of strongly - splitting events in the alluvial diagrams , we counted the citations of TCs resulting from splittings . As shown in Fig 15 , we did this for number of citations 2 years after the events , and also 5 years after the events . There were no obvious trends . The results of back - ward mixing degree , i . e . merging , are similar . Focusing on the highly productive chain of knowledge processes that led to experimental realizations of BEC , quantum teleportation and slow light , we checked the citation profiles between 1995 and 1998 . While the 1995 BEC + QI + QO TC cited a slightly lower proportion of Fig 11 .

The full effect of this BEC breakthrough can be seen in the large proportions of 1996 papers cited by the 1997 and 1998 TCs and the proportion of 1997 papers cited by the 1998 TC ( see Fig 8 ) . Indeed , we have provided early evidence suggesting that strongly - mixing Kuhnian processes are associated with greater impact . Conclusions In this paper we have studied the knowledge evolution in physics restricted to the APS citation network . We built yearly bibliographic coupling networks , identified TCs and calculated the intimacy indices between TCs in successive years . Based on these results , we visualized the long - term knowledge evolution in physics research in the form of alluvial diagrams . From these alluvial diagrams , we see not only the split of PR into PRA , PRB , PRC and PRD in 1970 , Fig 12 .

Overall , we find that the sizes of TCs are governed by a simple linear combination law . We find that merging events are highly correlated with inter - TC connections , making it possible to statistically predict merging events , while splitting events are more complex , as they are weakly correlated with the sizes or internal structures of the TCs . Finally , we showed using the QO , QI , and BEC case study that a strong merging / splitting event will significantly alter the field’s reference structure . In contrast with the well - known Popperian / Kuhnian qualitative and descriptive picture of science , which relate natural phenomena and their explanations with the practices of scientists , our approach leverage on the large and relatively complete data set on scientific publications , to look at changes at a whole - of - science ( whole - of - physics in this Fig 13 .

We should emphasize that our results should still be interpreted cautiously because of a number of limitations . One obvious limitation is that our citation network is restricted to APS journals , which are prestigious journals and likely reflect the frontiers of physics research , but are incomplete in two ways . First , many important physics papers are published outside of the APS journals , like Nature , Science and Applied Physics Letters . These papers are clearly impor - tant components of physics research . The second limitation is that even for the APS papers , we only have citations pointing back to APS papers . This means that the BCN between APS papers is not complete . For example , if two APS papers cite the same Nature paper , but no APS paper in common , this information will not be captured in the data set . The distortion due to the Fig 14 .

There is also a third limitation , not due to the choice of the APS data set . This has to do with our choice to only consider pair - wise relations on merging prediction for simplicity . This is appropriate as a first step , but may not accurately reflect the many multiple - party merging events that we also see in our study . While we believe we have made the correct first step towards a quantitative science of knowledge evolution , many open questions remain . The most crucial one is on the micro - scopic mechanisms governing merging and splitting . Can we build a model to simulate such evolution ? How will this evolution picture change if we use more complete data set , like the Web of Science ? It is well known that citation conventions in different disciplines are very dif - ferent . What is therefore the evolution picture in other disciplines , like biology or social sci - ence ? We seek to address these questions and more in future investigations . Fig 15 .
