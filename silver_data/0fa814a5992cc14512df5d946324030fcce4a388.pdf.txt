Plant Methods Rapid in - solution preparation of somatic and meiotic plant cell nuclei for high - quality 3D immunoFISH and immunoFISH - GISH Diána Makai 1 , 2† , Edit Mihók 1 , 2† , Dávid Polgári 1 , 3 , András Cseh 1 , Andrea Lenykó‑Thegze 1 , 4 , Adél Sepsi 1 * and László Sági 5 * Abstract Background Though multicolour labelling methods allow the routine detection of a wide range of fluorescent ( immuno ) probe types in molecular cytogenetics , combined applications for the simultaneous in situ detection of pro‑ teins and nucleic acids are still sporadic in plant cell biology . A major bottleneck has been the availability of high‑qual‑ ity plant nuclei with a balance between preservation of 3D ultrastructure and maintaining immunoreactivity . The aim of this study was to develop a quick and reliable procedure to prepare plant nuclei suitable for various combi‑ nations of immunolabelling and fluorescence in situ hybridisation methods ( immunoFISH‑GISH ) . Results The mechanical removal of the cell wall and cytoplasm , instead of enzymatic degradation , resulted in a gen‑ tle , yet effective , cell permeabilisation . Rather than manually releasing the nuclei from the fixed tissues , the proce‑ dure involves in‑solution cell handling throughout the fixation and the preparation steps as ended with pipetting the pure nuclei suspension onto microscope slides . The optimisation of several critical steps is described in detail . Finally , the procedure is shown to be compatible with immunolabelling , FISH and GISH as well as their simultaneous combinations . Conclusion A simple plant cell nuclei preparation procedure was developed for combined immunolabelling‑in situ hybridisation methods . The main and critical elements of the procedure are : a short period of fixation , incorporation of detergents to facilitate the fixation of tissues and the penetration of probes , tissue grinding to eliminate unwanted cell components , and an optimal buffer to handle nuclei . The procedure is time efficient and is easily transferable without prior expertise .

Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 Background Microscopic imaging of the chromatin in the plant cell has greatly contributed to our understanding of its dynamic organisation and function in fundamental cel - lular processes such as transcription , DNA repair and recombination . Tracing the chromatin within the plant nucleus has uncovered the non - random organisation of chromosomes into distinct nuclear territories [ 1 ] , where chromatin function is influenced by the dynamics and structural interactions between these territories . The compartmentalisation of individual genomic sequences or the characteristic shaping of chromosome regions through different stages of the plant cell cycle ( telomer / leptotene bouquet [ 2 ] , Rabl configuration [ 3 ] ) , the spatial distribution of genes and transposable ele - ments [ 4 ] , and specific epigenetic states ( DNA methyla - tion , histone modifications ) are all indispensable factors for the chromatin to express its complex functions . It is therefore essential that a complementary array of meth - ods is available for the detection and dynamic monitoring of these factors [ 5 ] . Immunodetection and fluorescence in situ hybridisa - tion ( FISH ) methods , which make use of labelled anti - bodies and nucleic acid probes , respectively , are powerful tools to study chromatin organisation and estimate the dynamics of specific genomic regions . Immunolabelling can primarily detect nuclear proteins and their variants while FISH provides a clear insight into the physical posi - tion of genomic loci or chromosome segments relative to the cell surface . Additionally , FISH reveals the average proximity between two or more genomic loci situated within the nuclear space in multiple types of individual cells and over various developmental stages . FISH is therefore a powerful means for testing experimentally the predictions of structural models on the global nuclear architecture [ 6 , 7 ] . FISH and its whole genome flavour ( GISH ) have become standard tools for the physical map - ping of repetitive DNA sequences , multi - copy and even single - copy genes in plant chromosomes , and for the characterisation of full chromosome complements or translocated segments , respectively , in artificial hybrid as well as natural ( paleo ) allopolyploid genomes [ 8 ] . Based on these properties , chromosome in situ hybridisation has been applied in wide - ranging fields of plant biology research from chromosome evolution [ 9 , 10 ] to genome diversity and phylogeny [ 11 ] , and even to genome sequencing [ 12 ] . Though recent advances in high - and super - resolu - tion microscopy allow imaging and resolving nuclear arrangements in multiple colours and three dimensions ( 3D ) at the nanoscale , chromatin segments together with other functional proteins require preparative and labelling methods to achieve high - resolution fluores - cence signals . Imaging the plant nucleus is further encumbered by the presence of the cell wall , which blocks the access of protein antibodies and / or labelled probes within the cell . The major challenge in combin - ing immunodetection with FISH lies in the apparently contradictory requirement to preserve the antigen epitope ( s ) detected by the antibody as well as the 3D structure of the nucleus but also to allow the penetra - tion of the DNA probe to detect gene loci or chromo - somal sub - regions [ 13 ] . The standard procedures of plant nuclei preparations for immunohistochemistry and molecular cytology follow ( a ) a non - denaturing tissue fixation to preserve nuclear proteins and general ultrastructure , ( b ) an enzymatic treatment to remove the plant cell wall / cyto - plasm , and ( c ) manual tissue maceration to release cells on the surface of microscope slides [ 14 – 16 ] . Formaldehyde treatment is a widespread fixation method to preserve cellular proteins , chromatin struc - ture , and nuclear integrity / morphology within liv - ing tissues [ 17 , 18 ] . Depending on the aim of analysis , fixative concentration and treatment duration need to be adapted for each plant species or even genotype . The effectiveness of cell wall degradation depends on enzyme quality , which can vary among the manufac - turers ( or even batches of the same manufacturer ) . In addition , enzyme activities will significantly decrease or get lost with time , especially when reused and under - gone several freeze - thaw cycles . Finally , concentra - tions , dilution buffers , pH , temperatures , and duration times need to be optimised for the enzyme vendor and genotypes , representing a further lack of control in the methodology . An additional complication in the prepa - ration of nuclei for microscopic observation is the great deal of skill and training required for the manual release of cells ( by needles , brass rods , or tweezers ) from intact tissues onto the microscope slides , which are indispen - sable to produce high - quality specimens . To address the above limitations , we developed a simple nuclei preparation procedure where fixation is adjusted to preserve the 3D ultrastructure , while cell wall / cytoplasm are removed mechanically , without the use of dedicated enzymes . To allow the transferability of the present procedure , manual maceration of the intact tissues was substituted with tissue grinding . This procedure was tested with interphase / prophase nuclei from root tips and male meiocytes of small grain cere - als ( wheat , barley , and rye ) to obtain specimens suit - able for both immunolabelling and in situ hybridisation methods as well as for their combinations , but it can be applied to different plant species and cell types . Page 3 of 15 Makai et al . Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 Results The procedure was devised to ensure a practical in - solu - tion tissue treatment ( Fig . 1 : steps 1 – 7 ) that preserves antigen epitopes , chromatin structure , and nuclear integ - rity via a concomitant removal of extranuclear cell com - ponents ( cell wall and cytoplasm ) by mechanical force ( grinding and / or maceration ) instead of applying cell wall degrading enzymes . Short fixation for high‑quality nuclei preparations This method consists of a short treatment in paraform - aldehyde ( PFA ) , an additive and non - coagulant fixative , followed by thorough ( 2 × 5 min ) washing ( Fig . 1 : steps 1 – 2 ) . To efficiently remove the cytoplasm by mechani - cal force alone , fixation times ( 1 h in 4 % PFA ) used in our standard procedure had to be reduced .

The main steps of the procedure are numbered in the middle in coloured boxes . Buffers and the respective timing are indicated on the left and right side , respectively . Possible downstream applications are indicated in grey boxes in the bottom Page 4 of 15 Makai et al . Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 We first tested whether detergent added to the non - denaturing fixative influenced the quality of nuclei preparation . To this end , wheat and barley root tips were fixed for approx . 15 min in 4 % PFA with or with - out adding 0 . 5 % Igepal , a non - ionic and non - denaturing detergent , to the fixative solution . Penetration and fixa - tion were aided by vacuum infiltration for 5 min in all treatments . Short fixation without detergent resulted in a poor nuclear morphology for both wheat and barley with considerably damaged cells ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1A , left panel ) . The inclusion of the detergent ( 0 . 5 % Igepal ) readily improved nuclear morphology and reduced the number of damaged cells , although did not diminish it entirely ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1A , right panel ) . The 3D structure of the nuclei and the integrity of the chromatin was significantly improved as well ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1B ) . The proportion of the damaged cells in wheat fixed without the addition of a detergent reached 80 % while 0 . 5 % Igepal significantly reduced the proportion of dam - aged cells to 17 % of the total cell population ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1C left : binomial test , p < 0 . 001 , n = 122 ) . Like - wise , 57 % of barley nuclei fixed without a detergent were damaged whereas the addition of 0 . 5 % of Igepal signifi - cantly reduced the proportion of damaged cells to 18 % ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1C right , binomial test , p < 0 . 001 , n = 159 ) . Having determined the key role of detergents during fixation , we searched for the optimal duration of fixation to further increase 3D structural preservation and poten - tially reduce the quantity of damaged nuclei or debris . Three different fixation times were applied to wheat and barley root tips ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2A and B , resp . ) : 60 ( 5 min vacuum + 55 ) min , 30 ( 5 + 25 ) min , and 13 ( 5 + 8 ) min . We looked for the most favourable 3D struc - ture with an adequate nuclear permeability as achieved via the subsequent mechanical removal of cell wall and cytoplasm . The 60 min fixation ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2A , B , first columns ) resulted in an excellent 3D struc - ture , but the mechanical forces applied were not effective in removing the cytoplasm . This compromised perme - ability of the nucleus was confirmed by immunoFISH ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2A , B , first columns , bottom images ) , which showed high background staining and low signal intensity both for the antibody and the FISH probes . Fixations of 30 min and 13 min both preserved the nuclear structure and also allowed a good antibody and probe penetration ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2A , B , second and third columns , and Fig . 3 , Fig . 5 ) . The 30 min of fixation had the advantage of producing a lower proportion of damaged cells and debris , especially in wheat ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2A ) , and it was therefore considered as an optimal fixation time for the genotypes used in the present study . Tissue homogenisation and sample preparation Tissue homogenisation in a dedicated grinding set ( Fig . 1 : step 3 , see the M & M section ) offers the advantage to pro - cess large amounts of plant material in a short period of time , to reduce the need for rigorous manipulations , and to improve cell permeabilisation . The introduction of tissue grinding makes the method easily transferable and reproducible , with providing good quality nuclei preparations . Cells , however , are prone to form aggre - gates in suspensions , which prevents successful cyto - plasm removal , effective cell filtration and causes high background staining in molecular cytology methods . To reduce cell aggregation , tissue grinding was performed in different solutions to identify the most suitable composi - tion for cell separation . Three solutions , PEM ( or BRB80 ) buffer [ 19 ] , extrac - tion solution ( 0 . 2 M mannitol , 0 . 15 M glucose , 2 mM CaCl 2 ) , and LB01 buffer [ 20 ] ( see the “Materials and methods” section ) were tested for this purpose . Tissue grinding in the PEM buffer and the extraction solution resulted in large cell aggregates and hardly any individ - ual nuclei in barley ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S3 ) . Samples in LB01 , however , contained a high proportion of individual nuclei indicating an adequate cell wall / cytoplasm elimi - nation ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S3 ) . The homogenised cells were double - filtered through a 70 - µm and a 40 - µm strainer ( Fig . 1 : step 4 ) , then pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 × g ( Fig . 1 : step 5 ) . The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in LB01 buffer ( Fig . 1 : step 6 ) , pipetted on the surface of an adhesion slide and air dried ( Fig . 1 : step 7 ) . The slides were then directly pro - cessed or stored at − 80 °C for several months . Optimised steps during in situ hybridisation Performing immunolabelling with the blocking solu - tion containing detergents ( Fig . 2 : step 1 ) significantly improved the efficiency of the subsequent in situ hybridi - sation procedure . However , the detection of specific DNA sequences by FISH or whole genomes by GISH required further permeabilisation . Therefore , pre - FISH / GISH permeabilisation of inter - phase / prophase nuclei was based on the method of [ 21 ] and involved a detergent treatment ( Fig . 2 : step 3 ) with CHAPS ( 0 . 3 % ) , Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 3 % ) , and Igepal ( 0 . 3 % ) added to PBS , followed by a short pepsin endopepti - dase digestion ( Fig . 2 : step 4 ) . Microscopic observation of counterstained nuclei has been instrumental in the timing of this step : cells with apparent cytoplasm and intact nuclear morphology can withstand a longer ( up Page 5 of 15 Makai et al . Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 to 5 min ) treatment and slightly deformed cytoplasm - free nuclei required a shorter , 2 – 3 min digestion . The permeabilised nuclei were briefly post - fixed ( 3 min ) in PFA - Igepal ( Fig . 2 : step 5a ) and , after probe denaturation ( Fig . 2 : step 5b ) , the slides ( now including the probe mixture ) were denatured again ( Fig . 2 : step 6 ) at a high temperature ( 75 °C , 6 min ) . After testing sev - eral denaturation times ( 3 – 4 – 4 . 5 – 5 – 5 . 5 – 6 min ) , 6 min gave the most reliable signal - to - noise ratio ( results not shown ) . We also tested the effect of probe length delivered by different durations of the nick - translation labelling on the quality of immunoFISH - GISH in somatic nuclei of a wheat - barley translocation line ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S4 ) . Tissue fixation was carried out for 1 h ( 5 + 55 min ) , 30 min ( 5 + 25 min ) or 13 min ( 5 + 8 min ) in 4 % PFA - 0 . 5 % Igepal to also reveal the optimal fixation time for the immunoFISH - GISH procedure . The probe length ( 300 – 500 bp , determined by gel electrophoresis ) was controlled by fragmenting the total DNA of barley prior Fig . 2 Flowchart of the immunolabelling and immunoFISH‑GISH methodology ( modified from [ 21 ] ) . The main steps are numbered in the middle in coloured boxes . The treatment conditions for immunolabelling and FISH‑GISH are indicated on the left and right side , respectively Page 6 of 15 Makai et al .

To visualise the barley chromosome segment in the translocation line , the fragmented total barley DNA was labelled by nick - translation for either 60 min ( long - est fragments ) , 100 min ( shorter fragments ) , or 120 min ( shortest fragments ) . Nuclei fixed for 1 h did not exhibit specific GISH signals when hybridised with any of the prepared probes ( 60 min - , 100 min - or 120 min - labelled ) . Similar results were obtained when hybridising the 30 min - fixed and 13 min - fixed nuclei with the long - est , 60 min - labelled probes . Highly specific signals were detected when the probes had been labelled for 100 min ( only for 5 + 8 min of fixation ) or 120 min ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S 4 : framed panels ) . We thus concluded that fixations between 13 – 30 min and probes labelled for at least 100 min are needed to observe specific signals dur - ing immunoFISH - GISH . Applications of the optimised procedure Immunolabelling of somatic and meiotic nuclei We applied our procedure to prepare interphase / pro - phase nuclei from root tips of wheat , barley , and rye for immunolabelling with anti - CENH3 and anti - H3K4me1 antibodies ( Fig . 3 ) . The centromeric histone 3 ( CENH3 ) labels indicate the position of active centromeres and the mono - methylated epigenetic modification at lysine 4 in histone H3 is associated with transcribed DNA sequences in plants [ 22 ] and thus marks gene - rich euchromatic regions [ 23 , 24 ] . Due to its hexaploid state , the number of centromeric signals in the wheat genome is much higher than that in the diploid barley and rye ( Fig . 3A ) . Immunolabelling indicated in all these spe - cies a polarised positioning of the centromeres while the histone epigenetic marks showed a relatively even dis - tribution in blocks over the whole chromatin . This latter arrangement agrees with findings on the nuclear distribu - tion of H3K4me1 in several plant species [ 23 , 25 , 26 ] and is consistent with data and the concept that euchromatic blocks are scattered over distal chromosomal regions in plants [ 25 , 27 – 30 ] . Prophase I . stage nuclei from male meiocytes of barley were immunolabelled ( Fig . 4 ) as above demonstrating the reliability of the nuclei preparation procedure in differ - ent types of cells and tissues . Additional labelling with an antibody for the meiosis - specific synaptonemal complex transverse filament protein ( ZYP1 , Fig . 4B ) was also com - patible with the procedure . ImmunoFISH The immunoFISH method was applied on barley , wheat and a wheat × barley F1 hybrid line to detect and colo - calise the CENH3 protein with specific DNA sequences in 3D ( Fig . 5 ) . Optical sectioning showed the peripheral positioning of barley centromeric satellite repeats ( G + C ) and their partial colocalisation with the CENH3 protein , which demarcates the functional centromeres ( Fig . 5A ) . High - resolution microscopy and 3D - rendering revealed , however , that the centromeric repeats expand beyond the CENH3 - loaded centromeres indicating that not all these satellite repeats bind the CENH3 protein in bar - ley ( Fig . 5B ) . These observations are in agreement with the description of [ 31 ] . Similar results were collected in wheat , where the centromeric retrotransposons ( CRWs ) were detected by FISH parallel to labelling the active centromeres with a CENH3 - specific antibody . Wheat CRWs partially colocalised but also stretched beyond the CENH3 - rich core centromeres ( Fig . 5C ) , indicating that the CENH3 protein is loaded only to a part of the CRWs in wheat somatic nuclei . The combined nuclei prepara - tion and immunoFISH procedure also distinguished the barley and wheat centromeres in a wheat × barley F1 hybrid ( Fig . 5D ) as demonstrated by CENH3 - labelling in combination with FISH using the G + C satellite and CRW probes , respectively . Two barley centromeres car - ried CENH3 and were thus active in the wheat back - ground . Moreover , these barley centromeres colocalised with the wheat centromeres at the nuclear periphery ( Fig . 5D ) suggesting that they maintain the chromatin dynamics of the host genome . ImmunoFISH‑GISH To be able to study the dynamics of alien chromatin in ( cereal ) hybrid plants and localise specific proteins inside the nucleus we applied the triple combination of immu - nolabelling , FISH and GISH ( Fig . 6 ) on root tip nuclei , prepared by the described procedure , of a 7BS . 7HL wheat - barley translocation line . The barley chromatin ( a pair of the 7HL chromosome arm ) was visualised by GISH in the context of telomeric repeats ( TRS FISH ) and active centromeres revealed by CENH3 immunolabelling ( Fig . 6A , B ) . Barley centromere activity was confirmed by the presence of a distinct CENH3 signal on one end of the relevant chromosome arm , while the other end , located in the opposite nuclear hemisphere , was detected by the TRS probe ( Fig . 6C ) . As a result , immunoFISH - GISH precisely outlined the physical as well as functional regions of the introgressed barley chromosome arm . Discussion Several critical factors had to be optimised before the procedure could be applied consistently . First , the typical PFA fixation times of several hours in traditional protocols ( e . g . , [ 32 , 33 ] ) and 1 h in our stand - ard procedure [ 21 ] were reduced to 15 – 30 min so that the immunoreactivity of nuclear protein epitopes was better preserved . As a result of this short times of fixation , only Page 8 of 15 Makai et al . Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 covalent bonding of PFA is likely to occur instead of its usual cross - linking between proteins and nucleic acids [ 34 , 35 ] that significantly compromises immunodetec - tion . Formaldehyde is the oldest fixative [ 36 ] , and , despite its toxicity and carcinogenicity , it is still one of the most popular fixatives and reported to outperform its propri - etary alternatives [ 37 ] . Second , the addition of a detergent was used to enhance the penetration of PFA and to compensate for the short - ened fixation time ( see above ) . As an added benefit , this modification keeps the chromatin in a relaxed state [ 38 , 39 ] , thus counteracting its artificial condensation during subsequent steps ( see below ) . Previously , the non - ionic and non - denaturing detergent Nonidet P - 40 was occa - sionally added to fixatives [ 40 ] . Since Nonidet P - 40 has been no more available , the equivalent Igepal CA - 630 [ 41 ] was applied here . Third , it was essential to replace enzymatic treatment with tissue grinding for cell wall breakdown . The non - denaturing PFA fixes proteins around the DNA fibres Fig . 4 Immunolabelling of barley meiotic nuclei prepared with the non‑enzymatic in‑solution procedure .

Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 making them less accessible to labelled FISH / GISH probes . The interphase / prophase chromatin represents a further challenge because it is enclosed in the dou - ble membrane of the nuclear envelope as a barrier to the labelled probes . Mechanical disintegration of plant tissues for nuclei extraction has long been elaborated [ 42 ] and adapted to immunolabelling as well as in situ hybridization [ 43 ] . In our hands , the tissue grinder origi - nally developed for soft tissues [ 44 ] delivered reproduc - ible results when combined with subsequent filtering to remove cell debris . This debris is considered to cause non - specific antibody / probe binding and thus , as a source of background / noise signal , hampers the genera - tion of high - resolution images . Fourth and finally , for the simple in - solution approach a buffer supporting nuclear integrity had to be adopted . Out of three solutions commonly used for nuclei han - dling , the LB01 buffer appeared outstanding in this respect . The low aggregation of nuclei and reproducible signal intensities observed with LB01 can be attributed to its components ( see the “Materials and methods” sec - tion ) . The monovalent cations Na + and K + are known to stabilize chromatin structure [ 45 ] by preventing its intense condensation [ 46 ] . The polyamine spermine can substitute divalent cations in stabilizing nuclear proteins , while the chelator EDTA inhibits phenol oxi - dases and nucleases by immobilizing their metal cofac - tors ( Mg 2 + , Mn 2 + , and Cu 2 + ) . The inhibition of these enzymes is important in protecting nuclear proteins and the DNA from oxidation and denaturation . The non - ionic surfactant Triton X - 100 aids the lysis and solubili - sation of plastid membranes [ 47 ] and thus contributes to decreased cytoplasmic contamination . The aim of this study was to develop a simple and ver - satile plant nuclei preparation procedure suitable for multiple purposes such as immunolabelling or in situ hybridisation alone but also the combination of these methods . We intended to include immunoFISH - GISH into the repertoire of molecular cytology to study chro - matin dynamics and genome interaction in hybrid plants by detecting simultaneously selected loci ( e . g . , repetitive sequences , single - copy genes , and landmark chromo - somal regions ) and specific nuclear proteins . The key factors in this procedure were improved fixa - tion , the substitution of cell wall degrading enzymes with mechanical tissue grinding , and the introduction of in - solution preparation and pipetting of nuclei to micro - scope slides rather than manually releasing them from the corresponding tissues . To make up for the limitations caused by the reduction in fixation times we facilitated this step by vacuum infiltration and the inclusion of a non - ionic detergent . Compared with the alternatives currently avail - able the present procedure is simple , easily transfer - able , and feasible for non - experts in the field of cytology .

Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 preparation - ready cell nuclei is about half as much ( ca . 45 min vs . 90 min ) with a similar hands - on time as in our standard procedure [ 21 ] . The omission of the cell wall degrading enzymes ( e . g . , [ 48 – 51 ] ) and of the manual preparation [ 52 ] makes the procedure more reliable and time efficient . The main time spare points compared to the listed protocols are the short duration of fixation ( 15 – 30 min vs . 1 – 2 days ) and the elimination of enzymatic digestion ( 1 – 4 h ) . We would like to emphasise , however , that the com - bination of immunolabelling and in situ hybridisation methods in plants are highly challenging due to the contrasting requirements for fixation and the difficulty imposed by the cell walls . The present nuclei prepara - tion procedure and the immunoFISH - GISH method are closely linked to each other , therefore the combination of this preparation procedure with a different immunoFISH method ( and vice versa ) may lead to less satisfactory results . At the dawn of modern plant breeding , especially of cereals , several successful , founder varieties turned out to carry chromosome segments integrated from related wild species [ 53 ] . The best - known examples are the interspe - cific 1R ( 1B ) chromosome substitutions and the 1RS . 1BL translocations introduced from cultivated rye into hexa - ploid wheat [ 54 , 55 ] . While the translocation can be diag - nosed by various biochemical and molecular methods [ 56 ] , the initial molecular cytogenetic evidence for the 1RS . 1BL translocation was provided by GISH [ 57 ] . Here , we used , for the first time , immunoFISH - GISH to analyse another Robertsonian translocation ( 7HS . 7DL [ 58 ] ) and demarcated the introgression by its functional bounda - ries , i . e . , the active centromere via immunolabelling and the telomeric end via FISH . This is a strong case for the combination of fluorescence detection tools when the alien chromatin is in a well - defined nuclear context and the orientation of the chromosome arm can be revealed by labelling its landmarks .

Analogously to hyphenated methods in metabolomics ( e . g . , LC - MS or GC - MS / MS ) , the described nuclei prepa - ration procedure allows various combinations of immu - nolabelling and in situ hybridisation methods in plant cytogenetics . Two of these combinations , immunoFISH and immunoFISH - GISH , have been presented here and applied to somatic nuclei . Combining immunolabel - ling with 3D FISH and / or GISH creates a unique tool to assess the specific interactions and associations between proteins and nucleic acid sequences within the nucleus and this at the single cell level [ 13 ] . Thus , immunoFISH - GISH combined with the nuclei preparation procedure will facilitate more refined studies of chromatin dynam - ics , packaging , and stability throughout the cell cycle . For the future , this procedure could be tested with vari - ous super - resolution microscopy platforms [ 59 , 60 ] and adapted to alternative , PFA - free fixatives [ 61 , 62 ] . Other challenges to solve will be the use of multiple probes for immunolabelling and / or FISH in interphase / prophase nuclei as well as in metaphase chromosomes . Integration with newly developed imaging workflows [ 63 ] would be an additional argument for the widespread application of the procedure . Conclusion This study describes the development of a procedure for the preparation of high - quality 3D plant cell nuclei , which can reproducibly be applied to immunolabel - ling and in situ hybridisation methods as well as their combinations . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first methodi - cal description of a combined immunoFISH - GISH pro - cedure in plants . The successful introduction of this triple - combined sophisticated methodology proves the high - quality of the plant nuclei prepared by the described procedure . Materials and methods Plant material The materials used in the present study to obtain mitotic or meiotic preparations were the hexaploid wheat ( Triti - cum aestivum L . ) landrace ‘Chinese Spring’ , the six - row spring barley ( Hordeum vulgare L . ) ‘Morex’ [ 64 ] , the rye ( Secale cereale L . ) ‘Lovászpatonai’ , a stable and fertile wheat - barley Robertsonian translocation line with the short arm of 7B wheat chromosome fused to the long arm of the 7H barley chromosome ( 7BS . 7HL transloca - tion , [ 53 ] ) , and a wheat × barley F1 hybrid ( 37 / 2020 , 2 n = 23 , 21ABD + 2H chromosomes ) from a cross between a Chinese spring wheat ( ‘Sichuan’ ) - derived doubled maternal haploid line , M1 ( produced by previous polli - nations with barley ) and the ‘Golden Promise’ barley as described earlier [ 65 ] . Collection of starting material Seeds of wheat , barley , rye , and the 7BS . 7HL wheat - barley translocation line were germinated in Petri dishes containing filter paper and an excess amount of water ( 50 % distilled water - 50 % tap water ) . Following incuba - tion at room temperature for 24 h , the excess water was removed , and the seeds were kept on wet filter paper for another 48 h to allow coleoptile emergence and root growth . When the root lengths reached 1 – 2 cm , root tips were collected and placed into the fixative . For the wheat × barley F1 hybrid , roots were collected from potted plants placed for 1 week into trays contain - ing ~ 1 cm water . The emerging white roots were trans - ferred to 1 × PBS ( phosphate - buffered saline : 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 68 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1 . 76 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) and used for fixation . Anthers were collected from the ears of ‘Morex’ barley as described [ 21 ] . Briefly , ears estimated to be entering meiosis were collected approximately 3 h after the light had come on . One of the three anthers per floret was squashed in 1 % ( w / v ) acetocarmine stain and inspected under a phase contrast microscope to identify the approximate meiotic stage while the remaining anthers were placed into the fixative . Fixation Root tips were immersed in ice - cold 4 % PFA ( freshly diluted in 1X PBS from isotonic 16 % ( w / v ) Paraformal - dehyde Solution ; Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA , 28908 ) containing 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Igepal CA - 630 ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MI , USA , I8896 ) and vacuum infil - trated for 5 min . After releasing the vacuum , the root tips were kept on ice and immersed in the fixative for another 8 or 25 min ( see the Results section ) , then washed two times for 5 min in ice - cold PBS . Anthers were fixed as above for 5 min under vacuum , then for an additional 8 min , both on ice . In‑solution preparation of nuclei Fixed root tips or anthers cut with a razor blade were transferred into a 2 mL KIMBLE Dounce tissue grinder equipped with pestles A ( large clearance ) and B ( small clearance ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , D8938 ; [ 44 ] ) followed by adding 1 mL of LB01 buffer ( 15 mM Tris – HCl , 20 mM NaCl , 80 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM spermine , 2 mM Na 2 EDTA , and 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , pH 9 . 0 ) [ 20 ] . The tissues were homogenised with pestle A for one min and for an additional four minutes with pestle B , which resulted in a homogeneous cell suspension , lacking an apparent Page 12 of 15 Makai et al . Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 debris . The suspension was then filtered through a 70 - µm and 40 - µm cell strainer ( pluriStrainer Mini 70 µm , 43 - 10070 - 40 and pluriStrainer Mini 40 µm , 43 - 10040 - 40 ; pluriSelect Life Science , Leipzig , Ger - many ) . The filtered cell suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min . The supernatant was removed , and the pellet was resuspended in 50 µL of LB01 buffer . Five to eight µL of cell suspension were pipetted onto adhesion microscope slides ( Epredia Superfrost ® Plus Adhesion Microscope Slides ; Menzel - Gläser , Braunschweig , Germany ) and allowed to air dry ( 8 – 10 min ) . The specimens were either used directly for the cytological experiments or frozen on dry ice and stored for several weeks or months at – 80 °C . Immunolabelling The immunolabelling and in situ hybridisation methods were based on our published procedure [ 21 ] with major modifications . The primary antibodies included a rabbit antibody raised against the CARTKHPAVRKTK peptide in the N - terminus of the wheat centromeric histone H3 protein ( CENH3 ) [ 66 , 67 ] , a mouse anti - H3K4me1 anti - body ( Diagenode , Seraing , Belgium , C15200150 ) , and , for meiotic cells , a rat anti - ZYP1 antibody [ 67 , 68 ] . The ZYP1 antibody was prepared in a custom immunisation pro - gram against a recombinant protein covering a 424 AA sequence within the C - terminal region of the Arabidopsis thaliana ZYP1 protein as described [ 68 ] . The primary antibodies were diluted in 1X TNB block - ing buffer ( 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 15 M NaCl , and 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) blocking reagent , Sigma - Aldrich , 11096176001 ) containing 0 . 3 M glycine ( Sigma - Aldrich , G8898 ) , 0 . 2 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 0 . 2 % ( v / v ) Igepal CA - 630 , and 0 . 025 % ( w / v ) Saponin ( Sigma - Aldrich , 47036 ) solution , at a ratio of 1 : 100 ( CENH3 ) and 1 : 300 ( H3K4me1 ) . The slides were incubated with the primary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h and transferred to 4 °C for overnight incubation . The next day the slides were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before the primary antibodies were washed down two times for 5 min in PBS . The following secondary antibodies were applied depending on the respective primary antibody ( see above ) : two goat anti - rabbit IgGs , Star Orange and Star Red ( STORANGE - 1002 and STRED - 1002 , Abbe - rior GmbH , Göttingen , Germany ) , a goat anti - mouse IgG , Star Green ( STGREEN - 1001 , Abberior ) , and a goat anti - rat IgG , Star Green ( STGREEN - 1007 , Abberior ) . The secondary antibodies were diluted to 1 : 150 in 1 × TNB blocking buffer , then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min . The slides were then washed ( two times 5 min in PBS ) and either immediately processed for in situ hybridisation or mounted ( Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI ; Vector Laboratories , Newark , CA , USA , H - 1200 ) . In situ hybridisation Probe preparation and labelling To prepare the FISH probes , the barley centromere - specific G + C - rich satellite sequence [ 69 ] , part of the wheat centromeric retrotransposon ( CRW [ 66 ] ) , and the universal plant telomeric repeat sequence ( TRS [ 70 ] ) were amplified by PCR . The GISH probe was pre - pared from total DNA extracted with a standard CTAB method from fresh young leaves of ‘Manas’ barley . Amplified DNA sequences ( FISH ) or total barley DNA ( GISH ) were directly labelled by nick - translation ( AF488 NT Labeling Kit , PP - 305L - AF488 ; AF594 NT Labeling Kit , PP - 305L - AF594 ; and AF647 NT Labeling Kit , PP - 305L - AF647 ; Jena Bioscience , Jena , Germany ) . FISH probes were labelled in a PCR machine at 15 °C for 60 min . For the GISH probes , heat - fragmented ( 6 min , pressure cooker ) total DNA was labelled at 15 °C for 100 min . Pretreatments Cell permeabilisation was ensured by pipetting 50 µL of 1 × PBS containing 0 . 3 % ( w / v ) CHAPS zwitterionic surfactant ( Sigma - Aldrich , C3023 ) , 0 . 3 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 3 % ( v / v ) Igepal CA - 630 on the slides and covering them with a plastic coverslip . The slides were incubated in a moisture chamber at 37 °C for 15 min and washed in 1 × PBS at room temperature for 5 min followed by a quick , 10 s rinse . Further membrane permeabilisation was achieved by incubating the slides with 50 µL of prewarmed pep - sin solution ( 50 µg / mL , Sigma - Aldrich , P6887 ) under a plastic coverslip at 37 °C for 5 min . After washing two times in 1 × PBS for 5 min , 50 µL of 4 % PFA - Igepal CA - 630 solution ( see Fixation above ) was added to the slides and incubated at room temperature for 3 min under a plastic coverslip . Fluorescence in situ hybridisation The hybridisation mix contained 60 % ( v / v ) deion - ised formamide ( Sigma - Aldrich , F9037 ) , 10 % ( w / v ) dextran sulphate ( Sigma - Aldrich , 67578 ) in 2 × SSC ( saline - sodium citrate ) . A volume of 17 µL per slide was completed with 40 – 60 ng of the labelled probe and denatured at 85 °C for 8 . 5 min in a PCR machine . The denatured probe mixture was immediately trans - ferred to ice for at least 5 min . The ice - cold mixture was pipetted on the surface of permeabilised and post - fixed specimens and covered with a 22 × 32 glass coverslip . The slides were denatured at 75 °C for 6 min in a PCR machine equipped with a stainless - steel plate , then incubated at 37 °C for 5 – 18 h in a moisture chamber to allow hybridisation . Post - hybridisation washes were Page 13 of 15 Makai et al . Plant Methods ( 2023 ) 19 : 80 performed two times in 1 × PBS at 37 °C for 5 min and the slides were mounted in 12 µL of Vectashield Anti - fade Mounting Medium with DAPI . Simultaneous FISH‑GISH Fifty ng of labelled GISH probe per slide was pipetted together with 40 - 60 ng of FISH probe and an excess ( 30 × ) of CTAB - purified , unlabelled total wheat DNA ( block - ing ) in 18 µL hybridisation mix per slide ( see above , FISH procedure ) . Probe and slide denaturation , hybridisation , washes and mounting were carried out as described for FISH . Confocal laser‑scanning microscopy Detection of fluorescence signals was performed by an SP8 Tunable Confocal System ( TCS : Leica Microsys - tems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . The DAPI - stained chromatin was detected between 410 and 470 nm after excitation at 405 nm . The settings for the applied fluorescent dyes conjugated to various secondary antibodies were as fol - lows : Star Green and Alexa Fluor 488—excited at 488 nm , detected from 490 to 560 nm ; Star Orange and Alexa Fluor 594—excited at 561 nm , detected from 600 to 660 nm ; Star Red and Alexa Fluor 647—excited at 633 nm , detected from 650 to 700 nm . A series of confocal images ( ‘ z - stacks’ ) with a lateral ( x and y ) resolution of 45 nm and an axial ( z ) resolution of 200 nm were acquired by an HC PL APO CS2 63 × / 1 . 40 oil immersion objective ( Leica ) . The size of the confocal aperture was set to 1 . 35 Airy Units ( 128 . 9 µm ) . Image acquisition was carried out by bidirectional scanning along the x - axis and the images were averaged from three distinct frames to reduce image noise . Z - stacks were subjected to deconvolution by Huy - gens Essential v18 . 04 ( Scientific Volume Imaging , Hil - versum , the Netherlands ) and 3D reconstructions were obtained using the Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software v3 . 1 . 5 . 1638 or the Imaris mul - tidimensional microscopy data analysis software v9 . 6 ( Oxford Instruments , Abingdon , the United Kingdom ) .
