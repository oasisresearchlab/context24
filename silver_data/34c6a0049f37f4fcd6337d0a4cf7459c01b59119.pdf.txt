Pedersen 1 & Ludovic Vallier 1 Although the first mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cell lines were derived 25 years ago 1 , 2 using feeder - layer - based blastocyst cul - tures , subsequent efforts to extend the approach to other mam - mals , including both laboratory and domestic species , have been relatively unsuccessful . The most notable exceptions were the derivation of non - human primate ES cell lines 3 followed shortly thereafter by their derivation of human ES cells 4 . Despite the apparent common origin and the similar pluripotency of mouse and human embryonic stem cells , recent studies have revealed that they use different signalling pathways to maintain their pluripo - tent status . Mouse ES cells depend on leukaemia inhibitory factor and bone morphogenetic protein , whereas their human counter - parts rely on activin ( INHBA ) / nodal ( NODAL ) and fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) . Here we show that pluripotent stem cells can be derived from the late epiblast layer of post - implantation mouse and rat embryos using chemically defined , activin - containing culture medium that is sufficient for long - term main - tenance of human embryonic stem cells . Our results demonstrate that activin / Nodal signalling has an evolutionarily conserved role in the derivation and the maintenance of pluripotency in these novel stem cells . Epiblast stem cells provide a valuable experi - mental system for determining whether distinctions between mouse and human embryonic stem cells reflect species differences or diverse temporal origins . We initially determined that prolonged culture of human ES cells in chemically defined medium 5 ( CDM ) containing activin A and FGF2 ( CDM / AF ) maintained their fundamental characteristics ( See Supplementary Data ) . We then tested similar conditions for derivation of pluripotent cells from pre - and post - implantation rodent embryos . Isolated inner cell masses ( ICM ) grown in CDM / AF never gave rise to pluripotent cell lines , but underwent rapid differentiation ( Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . In contrast , when late epiblast layers were dissected from pre - gastrulation stages ( 5 . 75 days post coitum ( d . p . c . ) / embryonic day ( E ) 5 . 75 ) for a B6 3 CBA F 1 genetic background or 6 . 5 d . p . c . for a NOD genetic background ) and cultured for 24 h in CDM / AF , they formed colonies of compact cells with high nucleo – cytoplasmic ratios ( Fig . 1c ) , a characteristic trait of pluripotent stem cells . Cells on the periphery started to differentiate the following day , producing a broad ring of stromal cells surround - ing smaller aggregates of compact cells , which grew to form larger colonies of compact cells 4 – 5 days later ( Fig . 1a – j ) . Such colonies were picked , fragmented into smaller clumps using collagenase and mechanical dissociation , and similarly passaged at 5 - day intervals . Immunostaining after 20 passages showed that these colonies of compact cells expressed the pluripotency markers Oct - 4 ( Pou5f1 ) , Nanog and SSEA - 1 ( Fut4 ) . They were designated epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) on the basis of their origin from pure late epiblast cell layers . The high rate of derivation ( 83 % for B6 3 CBA F 1 background and 93 % for the NOD genetic background ; Table 1 ) was striking for strains considered ‘non - permissive’ for mouse ES cell derivation 6 . Expression of Oct - 4 , Nanog and SSEA - 1 approached 95 % and was maintained for more than 40 passages ( Fig . 1k ; Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , suggesting that EpiSCs represent a near - homogenous population of pluripotent cells . EpiSCs grew as flat , compact colonies and were thus morphologi - cally distinct from mouse ES cells , which form rounded colonies ( Fig . 1k ) . Unlike mouse ES cells , passaging of EpiSCs using trypsin or other single - cell dissociation methods induced widespread cell death . No EpiSC lines could be derived in the presence of LIF and / or BMP4 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , the two factors required for mouse ES cellderivationandself - renewal . Ontheotherhand , theactivinreceptor inhibitor SB431542 induced rapid differentiation of EpiSCs ( Supple - mentary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , showing that EpiSC plur - ipotency depends strictly on activin / Nodal signalling .

However , FGF improved the overall quality of the cul - tures , suggesting that it reinforces the efficiency of activin signalling , as in human ES cells 7 . Taken together , these observations show that , despite their expression of standard markers of pluripotency , mouse EpiSCs differ significantly from mouse ES cells in their growth factor dependence , their colony morphology , and in being averse to pas - saging as single cells . Importantly , EpiSCs were also derived from rat embryos ( which have not previously yielded ES cells through conven - tional derivation methods ) at pre - gastrulation stages ( E7 . 5 – 7 . 75 ) ( Fig . 1a – j , Fig . 1k and Supplementary Information ) , suggesting that activin / Nodal signallingmay havea broader rolethan thatof LIF and BMP4in maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells . We characterized EpiSCs and their differentiated progeny using both quantitative ( Q - PCR ) and qualitative ( PCR , immunostaining ) methods . ( Because of the apparent similarity of mouse and rat EpiSCs , we focused this further characterization on mouse EpiSCs , except where noted ) . EpiSCs expressed higher levels of Oct - 4 and Nanog and similar levels of Sox2 as compared with mouse ES cells ( Fig . 2a ) . Conversely , EpiSCs did not express Rex1 ( Zfp42 ) , a specific marker of the ICM 8 that is silenced in early epiblast cells just after implantation but is expressed in mouse ES cells ( Fig . 2a ) . EpiSC transcript levels for Gbx2 , a marker of mouse ICM and ES cells , was one fourth that of mouse ES cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . On the other hand , transcripts coding for FGF5 and Nodal , two genes specifically expressed in the late epiblast layer 8 after implantation , were clearly detected in EpiSCs , in contrast to their low levels in mouse ES cells ( Fig . 2a ) . Interestingly , early primitive ectoderm - like ( EPL ) cells that were established by growing mouse ES cells in HepG2 - conditioned medium in the absence of LIF 9 also express FGF5 , but not Rex1 . However , EPL cells revert to ES cells in the presence of LIF—which is not possible with EpiSCs ( data not shown ) —and EPL cells are unable to differentiate in vitro into extra - embryonic tissues , which can be generated from EpiSCs grown in the presence of BMP4 ( see below ) , thus excluding the possibility that EpiSCs are EPL cells . Curiously , alkaline phosphatase activity , which generally marks pluripotent cells ( including human ES cells and mouse ES cells ) , was present in the late epiblast layer itself , but disappeared abruptly on culture and was undetectable in EpiSCs ( Fig . 2b ; Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . The lack of alkaline phosphatase activity also distinguishes EpiSCs from germ cells because the activity persists in primordial germ cells 10 , 11 in the gastrulating embryo 12 and in their in vitro derivatives , the embryonic germ cells . In addition , EpiSCs did not express germ cell markers such Blimp1 and Stella ( Supplementary Information ) , thereby confirming that EpiSCs are not derivatives of primordial germ cells .

This showed that EpiSCs had fewer differences with dissected late epiblast than with ICM or mouse ES cells , suggest - ing that EpiSCs are transcriptionally similar to their embryonic tissue source . Despite sharing expression of core transcription factor circuitry with mouse ES cells , the EpiSCs established by culturing late epiblast layers in CDM / AF differ from mouse ES cells in other key attributes , suggesting that EpiSCs are a novel type of embryonic stem cell that closely resembles the late epiblast layer of the intact post - implantation mouse embryo from which they have been derived . To assess the extent of pluripotency of EpiSCs , we used a com - bination of in vivo and in vitro assessments involving ectopic transplantation , chimaera production , and embryoid body forma - tion to examine their differentiative potential . EpiSC colonies injected into the testis capsule of immunodeficient mice were capable of forming teratomas containing a wide variety of tissues , including muscle , cartilage , neuronal rosettes , liver and gut ( Fig . 3a – d ) , thereby reaffirming the multi - lineage pluripotency of EpiSCs .

NATURE | Vol 448 | 12 July 2007 LETTERS 193 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup capacity for integration into pre - implantation - stage mouse embryos was examined by injecting EpiSCs into mouse blastocysts or by aggregating mouse embryos at the 8 cells or morula stage with EpiSC clumps ( see Supplementary Information ) . Only two chimaeras were obtained out of 385 injected blastocysts , and germline transmis - sion was not observed . Together these results suggest that , unlike the case for mouse ES cells , the pre - implantation embryo does not rep - resent a compatible environment for EpiSCs , possibly owing to a developmental asynchrony that limits theability of EpiSCs to colonise thehostembryos . Alternatively , sparsechimaerismcouldbeexplained by a limited capacity of EpiSCs for development into early cell lineages . Accordingly , to examine their differentiative capacity in greater detail , we determined whether EpiSCs could differentiate into a wide variety of cell types in vitro . Differentiation was achieved either by growing EpiSC colonies as embryoid bodies ( Supplementary Information ) or by differentiating them as monolayers into meso - derm , endoderm and ectoderm cells using a protocol devised for human ES cells ( L . V . , Touboul T . , Chng , Z . , Millan , E . , Trotter , M . , Weber , A . & R . A . P . , unpublished observations ) . Generation of derivatives of the three germ layers was confirmed by the expression of early and late markers ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) including brachy - ury ( mesoderm ) , Sox17 ( endoderm ) , Sox1 , nestin and b 2 III tubulin ( neuroectoderm ) ( Fig . 3e ) . As a further assessment of their in vitro differentiative capacity , EpiSCs were exposed to BMP4 , which has been shown to induce differentiation of human ES cells into prim - itive endoderm and trophectoderm 13 . EpiSCs grown in CDM sup - plemented with BMP4 in the absence of activin signalling rapidly differentiated into cells expressing markers of primitive endoderm ( Sox7 , Gata4 , Gata6 ) and trophectoderm ( Cdx2 , Hand1 , Eomes , H19 , a CG / Cga ) ( Supplementary Fig . 7b and 7c ) . Moreover , brachy - ury , Sox17 and Mixl1 were not detected in these conditions ( Sup - plementary Fig . 7b ) , suggesting that BMP4 is insufficient to drive differentiation of EpiSCs into mesendoderm . Finally , similar results were obtained with clonal sublines of mouse EpiSCs ( Supplementary Information ) , demonstrating that single EpiSC cells were capable of recapitulating the entire range of differ - entiative outcomes and thereby ruling out the possibility of a mixed cell population with diverse capabilities . All together , these results demonstrate that EpiSCs were capable of differentiating into deriva - tives of all three primary germ layers and into extra - embryonic tissues in vitro . Such broad differentiative capacity reaffirms the pluripotent status of EpiSCs , thus leading to the conclusion that limited EpiSC contribution in chimaeras is attributable to develop - mental asynchrony . Taken together , these results demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells can be cultured from widely separated mam - malian species using chemically defined culture medium supple - mented with activin . On this basis , we conclude that the activin / Nodal pathway has a central role in pluripotency of a new type of embryonic stem cells derived from mammalian embryos , specifically representing the late epiblast cell population just before gastrulation . EpiSCs differ from mouse ES cells not only in their embryonic tissue of origin but also in the signalling pathway maintaining their pluripotent status ( activin / Nodal versus LIF ) . This dependence of EpiSC pluripotency on activin / Nodal signalling also highlights their resemblance to late epiblast in vivo . Indeed , recent publications have established that embryos mutant for Nodal lack the expression of the pluripotency markers Oct - 4 and Nanog , instead ectopically expres - sing markers of anterior neuroectoderm 14 , 15 . Our results extend these recent findings by showing that activin / Nodal signalling not only is necessary for blocking neuroectoderm specification in vivo , but also that it is sufficient for maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells cultured from the late epiblast . The dependency of mouse ES cells on LIF signalling has focused attention on the early epiblast ( E4 . 5 or equivalent ) as their likely tissue of origin 16 . This reflects the narrow temporal role of LIF / GP130 signalling , which is required for mouse ICM viability only during delayed implantation . Moreover , mouse embryos that are homozygous mutants for Nodal 17 or its type I and II receptors 18 , 19 , progress well beyondtheblastocyst stage , arrestingonly at pre - gastrula stages , consistent with the hypothesis that LIF and activin / Nodal signalling immortalize stem cell populations at distinct developmental stages , namely , early and late epiblast , respectively . Intriguingly , EpiSCs share with human ES cells not only a depend - ence on activin / Nodal signalling but also other key differences from mouse ES cells that have previously been attributed to species diver - gence ( flattened colony morphology , inefficient clonal propagation and a limited capacity for colonising pre - implantation embryos 20 ) . Moreover , despite having similar core transcription factor circuitry , human ES cells and mouse ES cells have substantially different target genes for Oct - 4 and Nanog 21 , 22 . Also , the epigenetic stability of human ES cells seems to be greater than mouse ES cells , as shown here and previously by their extent of monoallelic imprinted gene expression 23 , 24 . Finally , EpiSCs ( like human ES cells 13 ) have been shown to differentiate into trophectoderm in the presence of BMP4 , whereas mouse ES cells have little or no capacity for contri - bution to either primitive endoderm or trophectoderm lineages in chimaeric embryos 25 and differentiate into trophectoderm only when their Oct - 4 gene is mutated by homologous recombination 26 . In summary , EpiSCs are temporally defined , embryonic stem cells that add a strategically important experimental system for under - standing the development of pluripotency . It has not escaped our attention that the unique properties of human ES cells , now seen to be shared with EpiSCs , could reflect a similar late epiblast origin . Understanding the relationships between cell - surface - mediated growth factor activities , core transcription factor circuitry and the epigenetic modifications accompanying pluripotency in EpiSCs could contribute significant insights to this issue . METHODS For derivation of EpiSCs , the late epiblast layer was dissected intact from pre - gastrulastagemouse [ E5 . 75 , ( B6XCBA ) F1mated interse ; E6 . 5 , NO Dmated inter se ] or rat [ E7 . 5 - 7 . 75 Wistar or Sprague Dawley ] embryos after 15 - 20 min treatment at 4 u C in Cell Dissociation Buffer ( Gibco ) . Dissection was accomp - lished in Calcium and Magnesium free Flushing and Handling Medium using glass needles to completely separate the epiblast layer from the extraembryonic tissues . Epiblast layers were then placed in chemically defined medium ( CDM ) 5 , supplemented with Activin A ( 20ng / ml , RandD systems ) and FGF2 ( 12 ng / ml , RandD systems ) . Every 4 - 5 days , cells were harvested using 5 mg / ml collagenase IV ( Invitrogen ) then plated into plates ( Costar ) pre - coated either with fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) or with 15 m g / ml of human Fibronectin ( Chemicon ) for 20 min at 37C and then washed twice in PBS .

Every 4 – 5 days , cells were harvested using 5mgml 2 1 collagenase IV ( Invitrogen ) or Accutase ( BioWest ) and then plated into plates ( Costar ) pre - coated either with fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) or with15 m gml 2 1 of humanFibronectin ( Chemicon ) for 20minat 37 u C andthen washed twice in PBS . EpiSCs and human ES cells were regularly frozen in a mediumcontaining90 % SerumReplacer ( Invitrogen ) and10 % DMSO ( Sigma ) . ICM immuno - surgery and epiblast dissection . For derivation at the blastocyst stage , ICMs were isolated from 3 . 5d . p . c . blastocysts obtained from B6 3 CBA F 1 mice mated inter se using immuno - surgery and then placed in CDM / AF on fibronectin . For derivation at post - implantation stages , the late epiblast layer was dissected intact from pre - gastrula stage mouse ( E5 . 75 , B6 3 CBA F 1 mated inter se ; E6 . 5 , NO D mated inter se ) or rat ( E7 . 5 – 7 . 75 Wistar or Sprague Dawley ) embryos after 15 – 20min treatment at 4 u C in Cell Dissociation Buffer ( Gibco ) . Dissection was accomplished in calcium - and magnesium - free Flushing and Handling Medium using glass needles to completely separate the epiblast layer from the extra - embryonic tissues . Epiblast layers were then placed in CDM supplementedwithgrowthfactors ( activin ( 20ngml 2 1 ) andFGF2 ( 12ngml 2 1 ) ) for culture as above . Subcloning of EpiSCs . EpiSC colonies were dissociated into single cells after 5min of treatment in 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco ) at 37 u C . Individual cells were then seeded in three different culture conditions . Subcloning in CDM / AF on fibronectin never gave any EpiSC colonies , confirming that clonal propaga - tion efficiency of EpiSCs in chemically defined medium is very low . Two other approaches based on feeder cells were then used to generate EpiSC sublines . The firstapproachconsistedofseedingindividual NOD backgroundEpiSCsongreen fluorescentprotein ( GFP ) - expressing EpiSCcoloniesthat hadbeenirradiatedto blocktheirproliferation . Usingthisapproach , theclonalefficiencyofEpiSCswas 5 % ; three non - fluorescent colonies were picked and amplified to study their property of differentiation . Another method of subcloning consisted of seeding individual NOD background EpiSCs on a layer of irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in CDM / AF . The clonal efficiency of EpiSCs in these culture condi - tions was , 15 % withsingle cells seeded either bylimiting dilution or using glass pipettes ; 11 EpiSC sublines derived on mouse feeders were picked and amplified inCDM / AFtostudytheir capacitytodifferentiateintothethreegermlayersand into extra - embryonic tissues . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature05950 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup
