Introduction Bile acids ( BA ) are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and are a signiﬁcant component of bile . They are stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine after a meal . BA are amphipathic steroid acids and are known as indispensable detergents , expediting the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids and lipophilic vitamins by forming micelles in the small intestine . Recently , they have also been considered to be signaling molecules . They are now recognized as ligands of farnesoid X receptor ( FXR ) , a nuclear hormone receptor , and Takeda G - protein receptor 5 ( TGR5 ) , a G - protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) that is also known as G protein - coupled bile acid receptor 1 ( GPBAR1 ) [ 1 ] . Bile salt composition of a variety of vertebrate species is validated . Bile salts include C 27 bile alcohols , C 27 bile acids , and C 24 bile acids . C 24 bile acids exist in all vertebrates , although C 27 bile alcohols and C 27 bile acids exist in ﬁsh , amphibians , reptiles , and birds [ 2 ] . 5 α - C 27 bile alcohol sulfates are considered as the ﬁrst ancestral bile salts . 5 α - cyprinol sulfate is 5 α - C 27 bile alcohol sulfate and activates FXR from the frog and the zebraﬁsh , but not from the human and the mouse . In contrast , taurochenodeoxycholic acid ( TCDCA ) and lithocholic acid ( LCA ) activate FXR from the human and the mouse , but not from the frog and the zebraﬁsh . Thus , the structure of FXR may be changed to adapt to bind species - speciﬁc bile salts [ 3 ] . BA regulate glucose and lipid metabolism by activating these receptors in various peripheral tissues , including the liver , brown and white adipose tissue , skeletal muscle , and the pancreas [ 4 ] . In addition , a recent study has shown that 20 di ﬀ erent kinds of BA can be found in the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the presence of two primary bile acids , chenodeoxycholic acid ( CDCA ) and cholic Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / biom9060232 www . mdpi . com / journal / biomolecules Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 2 of 20 acid ( CA ) , in the brain is essential [ 5 , 6 ] . In this review , we focus on recent advances in the understanding of the biosynthesis , signaling , and neurological functions of BA . 2 . Synthesis of BA BA are predominantly produced in the liver , via two biosynthetic pathways : The classical ( or neutral ) pathway and the alternative ( or acidic ) pathway [ 7 ] ( Figure 1 ) . The synthesis of BA from cholesterol involves at least 16 enzymes [ 8 ] . The classical pathway is initiated by cytochrome P450 7A1 ( CYP7A1 ) , also known as cholesterol 7 α hydroxylase . Cholesterol is converted to 7 α - hydroxycholesterol by CYP7A1 , which is the rate - limiting enzyme in this pathway . 7 α - hydroxycholesterol is then converted to 7 α - Hydroxy - 4 - cholesten - 3 - one . Cytochrome P450 8B1 ( CYP8B1 ) , also known as sterol 12 α - hydroxylase , is responsible for the production of CA from 7 α - hydroxy - 4 - cholesten - 3 - one , but 7 α - hydroxy - 4 - cholesten - 3 - one is also converted to CDCA by cytochrome P450 27A1 ( CYP27A1 ) , also known as sterol 27 - hydroxylase . The alternative pathway begins with the conversion of cholesterol to ( 25R ) - 26 - hydroxycholesterol [ 9 ] by CYP27A1 . Cytochrome P450 7B1 ( CYP7B1 ) , also known as oxysterol 7 - α - hydroxylase , leads ( 25R ) - 26 - hydroxycholesterol to CDCA . CDCA is converted to α - muricholic acid ( MCA ) , and β - MCA . These BA are then conjugated with glycine or taurine . BA synthesized in the liver are referred to as “primary BA” [ 10 – 12 ] . Primary BA in rodents are also conjugated with taurine in the liver [ 13 ] . Bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) and multidrug resistance - associated protein 2 ( MRP2 ) are the transporters that mediate the secretion of BA from hepatocytes into hepatic bile canaliculi ( Figure 2 ) . BSEP is the main transporter of BA , whereas MRP2 principally transports BA glucuronides and sulfates [ 1 , 14 ] . Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 19 [ 40 ] . BA conjugated with glycine or taurine are more effectively transported into cells by OATP1B1 / 3 than unconjugated BA [ 41 ] . However , BA in the portal vein are not completely reabsorbed by hepatocytes ( Figure 2 ) : The concentration of BA in the portal vein is 10 – 80 μ M and that in the systemic circulation of humans and rodents is ∼ 2 – 10 μ M [ 10 ] . Figure 1 . Synthesis of bile acids ( BA ) . The classical pathway is initiated by cytochrome P450 7A1 ( CYP7A1 ) . CYP7A1 converts cholesterol to 7 α - hydroxycholesterol . 7 α - hydroxycholesterol is then converted to 7 α - hydroxy - 4 - cholesten - 3 - one . Cytochrome P450 8B1 ( CYP8B1 ) leads the production of CA from 7 α - hydroxy - 4 - cholesten - 3 - one . 7 α - hydroxy - 4 - cholesten - 3 - one is also converted to CDCA by cytochrome P450 27A1 ( CYP27A1 ) . The alternative pathway begins with converting cholesterol to ( 25R ) - 26 - hydroxycholesterol by CYP27A1 . Cytochrome P450 7B1 ( CYP7B1 ) leads ( 25R ) - 26 - hydroxycholesterol to CDCA . CDCA is converted to α - muricholic acid ( MCA ) , and β - MCA . These BA are then conjugated with glycine or taurine . BA in rodents are also conjugated with taurine in the liver . BA synthesized in the liver are called primary BA . In the brain , 24 S - hydroxycholesterol is converted from cholesterol by cytochrome P450 46A1 ( CYP46A1 ) . 24 S - hydroxycholesterol is a precursor of 3 β - hydroxy - 5 - cholenoic acid , which can be converted to CDCA through the intermediates ( 3 β , 7 α - dihydroxy - 5 - cholenoic acid and 7 α - hydroxy - 3 - oxo - 4 - cholenoic acid ) . A large amount of ( 25R ) - 26 - hydoxycholesterol incorporates to brain from circulation , and ( 25R ) - 26 - hydoxycholesterol can also be converted to 3 β - hydroxy - 5 - cholenoic acid . Figure 1 . Synthesis of bile acids ( BA ) . The classical pathway is initiated by cytochrome P450 7A1 ( CYP7A1 ) . CYP7A1 converts cholesterol to 7 α - hydroxycholesterol . 7 α - hydroxycholesterol is then converted to 7 α - hydroxy - 4 - cholesten - 3 - one .

Bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) and multidrug resistance - associated protein 2 ( MRP2 ) are transporters mediating the secretion of bile acids ( BA ) from hepatocytes to the bile canaliculus in the liver . BA are stored in the gallbladder and secreted into the small intestine after a meal . Most BA ( approximately 95 % ) are reabsorbed , whereas the remainder is excreted with feces . Apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter ( ASBT ) in the apical brush border of enterocytes takes BA into enterocytes . Ileal bile acid - binding protein ( I - BABP ) is related to the intracellular transport in enterocytes . The passage of BA through the basolateral membrane of enterocytes into the portal blood occurs through organic solute transporter ( OST ) α and β . BA released into the blood from the small intestine are transported into the liver by Na + - taurocholate co - transporting polypeptide ( NTCP ) or organic anion - transporting polypeptides ( OATPs ) . These BA are then reconjugated and secreted with newly produced BA . This recycling system is termed enterohepatic circulation . 3 . BA in the Brain Both conjugated and unconjugated BA can be detected in the brain of humans and rodents [ 5 , 6 , 42 ] . Twenty BA have been identified in the rat brain , consisting of nine unconjugated BA and eleven conjugated BA [ 6 ] . Most of these 20 BA are also found in the blood of rats [ 43 ] . CDCA is present in the highest concentration in the rat brain [ 5 ] . Although the origin of brain BA remains unclear , they can be synthesized in the brain or transported into the brain from the peripheral circulation by BA transporters and / or diffuse across the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) . Conjugated BA require transporters to cross the BBB , because they are large and negatively - charged at physiological pH [ 44 , 45 ] , and indeed , transporters for both the uptake and efflux of BA , such as NTCP , OATP1 , BSEP , and MRP2 , have been identified in the choroid plexus and brain capillaries [ 46 − 48 ] . In addition , BA in the bloodstream can themselves induce permeability of the BBB . The BBB is formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells that are bound to adjacent cells via tight junctions [ 49 ] . Occludin is one of the membrane proteins that are responsible for tight junction formation in the BBB [ 50 ] , and Figure 2 . Enterohepatic circulation . Bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) and multidrug resistance - associated protein 2 ( MRP2 ) are transporters mediating the secretion of bile acids ( BA ) from hepatocytes to the bile canaliculus in the liver . BA are stored in the gallbladder and secreted into the small intestine after a meal . Most BA ( approximately 95 % ) are reabsorbed , whereas the remainder is excreted with feces . Apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter ( ASBT ) in the apical brush border of enterocytes takes BA into enterocytes . Ileal bile acid - binding protein ( I - BABP ) is related to the intracellular transport in enterocytes . The passage of BA through the basolateral membrane of enterocytes into the portal blood occurs through organic solute transporter ( OST ) α and β . BA released into the blood from the small intestine are transported into the liver by Na + - taurocholate co - transporting polypeptide ( NTCP ) or organic anion - transporting polypeptides ( OATPs ) . These BA are then reconjugated and secreted with newly produced BA . This recycling system is termed enterohepatic circulation . After primary BA are transported to and stored in the gallbladder , they are secreted into the small intestine , where the intestinal microbiota converts them into secondary BA . Conjugated primary BA are deconjugated by bacterial bile salt hydrolase [ 15 , 16 ] . In humans , 7 α - dehydroxylase converts CA and CDCA to deoxycholic acid ( DCA ) and lithocholic acid ( LCA ) , respectively [ 1 , 16 ] . CDCA is also converted to ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) by 7 α - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( 7 α - HSDH ) and 7 β - HSDH [ 17 ] . In rodents , β - MCA is transformed into ω - MCA , which is then metabolized to hyodeoxycholic acid ( HDCA ) , while α - MCA is converted to murideoxycholic acid [ 18 , 19 ] . Most BA molecules ( approximately 95 % ) are reabsorbed , and the remainders are excreted in the feces [ 20 ] . This reabsorption largely takes place in the small intestine , but a small proportion also occurs in the colon . Apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter ( ASBT ) in the apical brush border of enterocytes transports BA into enterocytes [ 21 – 25 ] , and a mutation in this transporter causes primary BA malabsorption [ 22 ] . Although diabetes is a multifactorial disease , appropriate glycemic control is crucial for the prevention of diabetic complications [ 26 – 29 ] . Inhibition of the reabsorption Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 4 of 20 of BA by an ASBT inhibitor ( GSK2330672 ) or a BA sequestrant ( colesevelam or colestimide ) causes a reduction in circulating BA concentrations , which leads to improvements in glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients [ 30 , 31 ] . Ileal bile acid - binding protein ( I - BABP ) , also known as fatty acid binding protein 6 , mediates intracellular transport in the enterocyte [ 21 , 32 ] , and the transport of BA through the basolateral membrane of enterocytes into the portal circulation is performed by organic solute transporter ( OST ) α and β . OST α and OST β are localized to the basolateral membranes of the enterocyte [ 21 ] and expressed as heterodimers or heteromultimers [ 33 – 35 ] . BA released into the blood from the small intestine are transported to the liver , reconjugated , and secreted with newly synthesized BA . Thus , BA secreted from the liver into the intestine are recycled , and this recycling system is referred to as the “enterohepatic circulation” ( Figure 2 ) . The transport of BA from the portal circulation into hepatocytes is performed by Na + - dependent and Na + - independent pathways . Na + - dependent transport of BA requires Na + - taurocholate co - transporting polypeptide ( NTCP ) , while Na + - independent transport is executed by organic anion - transporting polypeptides ( OATPs ) . NTCP is localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and is the main transporter responsible for transporting BA into hepatocytes using a Na + - dependent mechanism [ 36 – 38 ] . OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are members of the OATP family that are expressed in the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes [ 39 ] . Oatp1b2 is the rodent ortholog of human OATP1B1 / 3 [ 40 ] . BA conjugated with glycine or taurine are more e ﬀ ectively transported into cells by OATP1B1 / 3 than unconjugated BA [ 41 ] . However , BA in the portal vein are not completely reabsorbed by hepatocytes ( Figure 2 ) : The concentration of BA in the portal vein is 10 – 80 µ M and that in the systemic circulation of humans and rodents is ∼ 2 – 10 µ M [ 10 ] . 3 .

Twenty BA have been identiﬁed in the rat brain , consisting of nine unconjugated BA and eleven conjugated BA [ 6 ] . Most of these 20 BA are also found in the blood of rats [ 43 ] . CDCA is present in the highest concentration in the rat brain [ 5 ] . Although the origin of brain BA remains unclear , they can be synthesized in the brain or transported into the brain from the peripheral circulation by BA transporters and / or di ﬀ use across the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) . Conjugated BA require transporters to cross the BBB , because they are large and negatively - charged at physiological pH [ 44 , 45 ] , and indeed , transporters for both the uptake and e ﬄ ux of BA , such as NTCP , OATP1 , BSEP , and MRP2 , have been identiﬁed in the choroid plexus and brain capillaries [ 46 – 48 ] . In addition , BA in the bloodstream can themselves induce permeability of the BBB . The BBB is formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells that are bound to adjacent cells via tight junctions [ 49 ] . Occludin is one of the membrane proteins that are responsible for tight junction formation in the BBB [ 50 ] , and its phosphorylation by BA via ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( RAC1 ) increases the permeability of the BBB [ 51 ] . In contrast , unconjugated BA , such as CA , CDCA , and DCA , are lipophilic , even though they are ionized [ 52 ] . Therefore , unconjugated BA might be able to cross the BBB by passive di ﬀ usion , and indeed , there are strong correlations between the concentrations of unconjugated BA ( CA , CDCA , and DCA ) in the brain and the serum [ 53 , 54 ] . 24 S - hydroxycholesterol predominantly exists in the brain of humans and rodents and is generated from cholesterol in the brain by cytochrome P450 46A1 ( CYP46A1 ) , also known as cholesterol 24 - hydroxylase [ 55 – 58 ] ( Figure 1 ) . 24 S - hydroxycholesterol is a precursor of 3 β - hydroxy - 5 - cholenoic acid , which can be converted to CDCA through the intermediates ( 3 β , 7 α - dihydroxy - 5 - cholenoic acid and 7 α - hydroxy - 3 - oxo - 4 - cholenoic acid ) with rat brain extracts , although this CDCA - generating activity is very low [ 59 ] . Moreover , a large amount of ( 25R ) - 26 - hydoxycholesterol incorporates to brain from circulation , and ( 25R ) - 26 - hydoxycholesterol can also be converted to 3 β - hydroxy - 5 - cholenoic acid [ 60 ] . Therefore , it is thought that the principal source of BA in the brain is the peripheral circulation . Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 5 of 20 4 . Signaling Induced by BA FXR and TGR5 are the most studied receptors activated by BA [ 1 ] , but other nuclear receptors are also activated by BA , including pregnane X receptor ( PXR ) , vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , liver X receptor ( LXR ) , and glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) [ 61 , 62 ] , and in addition to TGR5 , sphingosine - 1 - phosphate receptor 2 ( S1PR2 ) , M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors , and formyl - peptide receptor ( FPR ) are cell - surface receptors activated by BA . All these receptors are expressed in the brain [ 63 – 68 ] . Furthermore , the bile acid - sensitive ion channel ( BASIC ) , epithelial Na + channel ( ENaC ) , and large - conductance Ca 2 + - and voltage - activated K + ( BK ) channels are ion channels that are activated by BA and are also expressed in the brain [ 69 – 73 ] ( Figure 3 ) .

Moreover , a large amount of ( 25R ) - 26 - hydoxycholesterol incorporates to brain from circulation , and ( 25R ) - 26 - hydoxycholesterol can also be converted to 3 β - hydroxy - 5 - cholenoic acid [ 60 ] .

Figure 3 . Bile acids ( BA ) activate receptors and ion channels . Nuclear receptors activated by BA include the farnesoid X receptor ( FXR ) , pregnane X receptor ( PXR ) , vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , liver X receptor ( LXR ) , and glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) . Unconjugated BA might be able to cross the plasma membrane , and conjugated BA might cross the plasma membrane using transporters . Cell surface receptors activated by BA are Takeda G - protein receptor 5 ( TGR5 ) , sphingosine - 1 - phosphate receptor 2 ( S1PR2 ) , M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors , and formyl - peptide receptor ( FPR ) . Bile acid - sensitive ion channel ( BASIC ) , epithelial Na + channel ( ENaC ) , and large - conductance Ca 2 + - and voltage - activated K + ( BK ) channels are ion channels that are activated by BA . These receptors and ion channels are expressed in the brain . Figure 3 . Bile acids ( BA ) activate receptors and ion channels .

These receptors and ion channels are expressed in the brain . 4 . 1 . Activation of Nuclear Receptors by BA FXR is a nuclear hormone receptor for which BA are ligands [ 74 – 76 ] . Unconjugated BA , such as CDCA , DCA , and LCA , are high - a ﬃ nity ligands of FXR [ 74 – 76 ] , and CA and conjugated BA can e ﬀ ectively activate FXR in the presence of a BA transporter ( NTCP ) in the cell [ 74 ] . However , taurine - β - MCA ( T β MCA ) , glycine - β - MCA ( G β MCA ) , and DCA act as antagonists at FXR inhibiting FXR signaling [ 77 – 79 ] . FXR monomers and heterodimers with a retinoid - X receptor ( RXR ) bind to their target sequence on DNA molecules , which is an inverted repeat of AGGTCA separated by one nucleotide ( IR1 ) [ 80 , 81 ] . Moreover , FXR can also bind to IR0 , an everted repeat of AGGTCA separated by two or eight nucleotides ( ER2 or 8 ) , and a direct repeat of AGGTCA separated by one , four , or ﬁve nucleotides ( DR1 , 4 , or 5 ) [ 80 , 82 – 84 ] . Comparison of the available DNA binding sites for FXR in the liver and the intestine has shown that they only have 11 % in common [ 80 ] , suggesting that the pattern of gene expression induced by FXR is tissue - speciﬁc , and , thus , that the genes regulated by FXR in the brain might be di ﬀ erent from those in peripheral tissues . PXR , VDR , and LXR also heterodimerize with RXR [ 85 ] . PXR is also known as the steroid and xenobiotic receptor ( SXR ) and is activated by many xenobiotics and endobiotics , but also by Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 6 of 20 LCA [ 86 – 88 ] . PXR plays an important role in the regulation of the expression of genes encoding transporters of drugs and enzymes , which are involved in drug metabolism . Drug transporters upregulated by PXR include MRP2 and OATP2 , and drug - metabolizing enzymes upregulated by PXR include CYP3A and CYP2B , which metabolize LCA to hyocholic acid and UDCA [ 84 , 89 – 92 ] . In contrast , CYP7A1 expression is suppressed by PXR , but PXR does not directly bind to the promoter region of the CYP7A1 gene . Instead , PXR suppresses the activation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α , which binds to the promoter region of the CYP7A1 gene and upregulates its expression [ 93 , 94 ] . Thus , PXR regulates genes involved in BA synthesis and metabolism . In addition , PXR expression can be upregulated by FXR [ 95 ] . VDR is a nuclear receptor that is crucial for the control of calcium homeostasis . Its main endogenous ligand is 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 , but LCA and its metabolite , 3 - keto LCA , are also able to activate VDR [ 96 , 97 ] . The activation of VDR leads to the upregulation of CYP family proteins and BA transporters , and in particular , LCA can induce CYP3A and MRP3 expression by acting as a VDR ligand [ 97 – 100 ] . LXR α and β control cholesterol homeostasis and are activated by oxysterols , which are endogenously produced cholesterol metabolites , but HDCA is also a weak activator of LXR α [ 101 , 102 ] . LXR α knockout mice exhibit a reduction in BA pool size and excretion , because LXR α upregulates the expression of CYP7A , which is the key enzyme required for the conversion of cholesterols to BA . In contrast , LXR β does not a ﬀ ect the expression of CYP7A [ 103 – 105 ] . GR is activated by glucocorticoids and induces or represses the expression of large numbers of genes , thereby inﬂuencing various physiologic functions , including metabolic homeostasis , stress , inﬂammation , and development [ 106 ] . UDCA , taurocholic acid ( TCA ) , and glycochenodeoxycholic acid ( GCDA ) induce GR activity [ 107 , 108 ] , and the activation of GR by UDCA suppresses nuclear factor - κ B activation [ 108 ] . Furthermore , the activation of GR by TCA or GCDA reduces the expression of corticotropin - releasing hormone in the hypothalamus [ 107 ] . SHP is a nuclear hormone receptor that is induced by the activation of FXR [ 109 ] Although it has a ligand - binding domain ( LBD ) , it lacks a DNA binding domain . The endogenous ligand of SHP has yet to be identiﬁed . The function of SHP is to repress many nuclear receptors , including PXR , CAR , LXR , GR , and FXR , which is achieved by the LBD of SHP interacting with the LBD of other nuclear receptors to inhibit their transcriptional activity [ 110 ] . Therefore , FXR can indirectly repress the expression of a range of genes by inducing SHP . 4 . 2 . Activation of Cell - Surface Receptors by BA TGR5 , also known as GPBAR1 or membrane - type receptor for BA ( M - BAR ) , has been identiﬁed as a GPCR for BA by two independent groups [ 111 , 112 ] . TGR5 can be activated by LCA , DCA , CDCA , CA , and taurine or glycine - conjugated forms of these BA . LCA and DCA , which are secondary BA , and conjugated forms of LCA and DCA , are the most potent activators of TGR5 [ 111 ] , but HDCA and UDCA are also weak activators of TGR5 [ 101 , 112 , 113 ] . TGR5 is expressed in various tissues , including the small intestine , liver , adipose , spleen , brain , and spinal cord . TGR5 activation is involved with the control of glucose metabolism , neuronal function , and the immune system [ 63 ] , and its activation by BA regulates a variety of signaling intermediates , including protein kinase A ( PKA ) , Akt / PKB ( protein kinase B ) , and mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) [ 114 ] . Because TGR5 is a G α s - coupled GPCR , the activation of TGR5 stimulates adenylyl cyclase to increase the concentration of cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) , activating PKA and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP ( EPACs ) [ 115 ] . The activation of TGR5 by BA can also activate both PKA and EPACs [ 116 ] . PKA and EPACs activate various signaling pathways , including Akt / PKB and MAPKs [ 117 – 119 ] . Moreover , TGR5 can also associate with G α i and G α q , although TGR5 has been identiﬁed to be a G α s - coupled GPCR [ 120 – 122 ] . In ciliated cholangiocytes , TGR5 is coupled to G α i and the activation of TGR5 results in a decrease in the concentration of cAMP and the activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( ERKs ) . In contrast , TGR5 is coupled to G α s and the activation of TGR5 results in an increase in the concentration of Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 7 of 20 cAMP and the suppression of ERK activation in non - ciliated cholangiocytes [ 121 ] . Thus , the signaling pathways inﬂuenced by the binding of BA to TGR5 vary according to cell type and cellular conditions . In addition , a recent report has shown that the expression of TGR5 can be induced by FXR in the ileum [ 123 ] . S1PR2 is one of ﬁve subtypes of S1PR ( S1PR1 - 5 ) . S1P is the ligand for the S1PRs and is generated by the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase 1 or 2 [ 67 , 124 ] , but BA can also act as ligands for S1PR2 . S1PRs are GPCRs , and S1PR2 can couple with G α i , G α q , or G α 12 / 13 [ 67 ] . S1PR2 is expressed in a variety of tissues and its activation inﬂuences various signaling molecules , including adenylyl cyclase , Akt / PKB , and MAPKs [ 65 , 67 , 124 ] . An unconjugated BA ( DCA ) and conjugated BA [ TCA , TDCA , tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDCA ) , glycocholic acid ( GCA ) , glycodeoxycholic acid ( GDCA ) , and glycochenodeoxycholic acid ( GCDC ) ] are ligands for S1PR2 , binding of which leads to the activation of ERKs and Akt / PKB [ 125 – 127 ] . M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors are GPCRs that are widely distributed and responsible for many of the physiological e ﬀ ects of acetylcholine . They exist in ﬁve subtypes ( M 1 – M 5 ) , of which the M 1 , M 3 , and M 5 receptors couple to G α q , while the M 2 and M 4 receptors couple to G α i [ 128 ] . It has been reported that conjugated BA ( TCA , GDCA , and TDCA ) are partial agonists of the M 2 receptor and activate the G α i pathway [ 129 , 130 ] , whereas DCA induces the expression of ALDH1 , CD166 , and Myc via the M 3 receptor [ 131 ] . TDCA stimulates the relaxation of phenylephrinein - induced constriction in aortic rings , and this TCDCA - stimulated - relaxation is diminished in aortic rings from M 3 receptor - knockout mice [ 132 ] . FPR is also a GPCR and has various ligands , including bacterially and mitochondrially - derived formyl peptides [ 68 ] . FPR couples to G α i and its activation leads to an increase in the mobilization of cellular calcium and the activation of signaling molecules , including MAPKs and Akt / PKB [ 66 , 133 ] . DCA and CDCA also bind to FPR and act as antagonists , suppressing the activation of FPR by formyl N - formyl - met - leu - phe ( fMLP ) , a bacterially - derived FPR ligand [ 134 , 135 ] . 4 . 3 . Activation of Ion Channels by BA BASIC is also known as acid - sensing ion channel subunit family member 5 ( ASIC5 ) or intestine Na + channel ( INAC ) in humans and brain - liver - intestine Na + channel ( BLINaC ) in rodents . BASIC is a member of the degenerin ( DEG ) / ENaC ion channel family [ 72 ] . CA , UDCA , HDCA , LCA , DCA , and CDCA can activate rodent BASIC . In contrast , only DCA and CDCA can activate human BASIC [ 136 ] . ENaC is also a member of the DEG / ENaC ion channel family and consists of α , β , and γ subunits [ 70 , 71 , 137 ] . In humans , the δ subunit of ENaC is highly expressed in the brain , and δβγ ENaC also exists in this tissue [ 71 , 137 ] . CA , DCA , CDCA , and their taurine conjugates can activate both δβγ ENaC and αβγ ENaC [ 137 ] . BK channels are composed of α and β subunits , and there are four isotypes of the β subunit that can be used . LCA , DCA , and CA activate BK channels , and LCA is the most e ﬀ ective BA in this regard [ 138 ] . LCA activates the BK channel by direct interaction with the transmembrane domain of the β 1 subunit [ 139 ] . The β 4 subunit is the most abundant subunit in the brain , but the β 1 subunit is also expressed in this tissue [ 73 ] . 5 . Neurological Functions of BA Twenty di ﬀ erent BA and their receptors have been identiﬁed in the brain , implying that BA have physiological and pathophysiological roles in this tissue ( Figure 4 ) , and indeed , many studies of their physiological roles in the brain have been reported . Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 8 of 20 Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 19 subunit [ 139 ] . The β 4 subunit is the most abundant subunit in the brain , but the β 1 subunit is also expressed in this tissue [ 73 ] . 5 . Neurological Functions of BA Twenty different BA and their receptors have been identified in the brain , implying that BA have physiological and pathophysiological roles in this tissue ( Figure 4 ) , and indeed , many studies of their physiological roles in the brain have been reported . Figure 4 . Protective functions of bile acids ( BA ) against neurodegeneration . BA are known to prevent the accumulation of amyloid β peptides in Alzheimer’s disease ; protect against mitochondrial damage in Parkinson’s disease ; protect against apoptosis , mitochondrial damage , and ubiquitin accumulation in Huntington’s disease ; and protect against apoptosis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . 5 . 1 . The Role of BA in the Brain BA affect the functioning of the receptors for several neurotransmitters , including M 2 and M 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors , γ - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) type A ( GABA A ) receptors , and N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors . TCA , GDCA , and TDCA activate the M 2 receptor , while DCA activates the M 3 receptor . M 2 receptors are distributed throughout the brain and are crucial for cognitive function . However , M 3 receptors are localized to neurons , which project to regions such as the hippocampus and substantia nigra , although they are also expressed at low levels throughout the brain . Thus , BA may affect cognitive function , memory , and learning [ 140 ] . NMDA receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that are activated by the simultaneous binding of both glutamate and D - serine or glycine [ 141 , 142 ] . Their activation causes Ca 2 + influx , which can induce long - term potentiation and long - term depression . Therefore , appropriate NMDA receptor activation is important for learning and memory [ 143 ] . In contrast , the GABA A receptor is an ionotropic GABA receptor that is a ligand - gated chloride ion channel . The activation of GABA A receptor causes an influx of chloride ions , leading to the hyperpolarization of neurons and the inhibition of neurotransmission [ 144 ] . CDCA , DCA , and CA block both GABA A and NMDA receptors [ 145 ] . Histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus ( TMN ) of the hypothalamus play an important role in arousal and wakefulness [ 146 ] and express GABA A receptors ; thus , the suppression of histaminergic neuronal activation in the TMN by GABA induces sleep [ 147 ] . Conversely , UDCA increases arousal by blocking GABA A receptors on TMN neurons [ 148 ] . Moreover , a recent study has demonstrated that TUDCA can induce neurogenesis in adult rats [ 149 ] . Adult neurogenesis is the process of generating new functional neurons that are added to the adult brain and occurs in two specific regions : The subgranular zone ( SGZ ) of the dentate gyrus ( DG ) in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) , located in the walls of the lateral ventricles . Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) in the SGZ of adult mammals generate neurons in the DG . NSCs in adult human SVZ may produce functional neurons in the striatum by migrating there . In contrast , NSCs in adult rodent SVZ may Figure 4 . Protective functions of bile acids ( BA ) against neurodegeneration .

Their activation causes Ca 2 + inﬂux , which can induce long - term potentiation and long - term depression . Therefore , appropriate NMDA receptor activation is important for learning and memory [ 143 ] . In contrast , the GABA A receptor is an ionotropic GABA receptor that is a ligand - gated chloride ion channel . The activation of GABA A receptor causes an inﬂux of chloride ions , leading to the hyperpolarization of neurons and the inhibition of neurotransmission [ 144 ] .

Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) in the SGZ of adult mammals generate neurons in the DG . NSCs in adult human SVZ may produce functional neurons in the striatum by migrating there . In contrast , NSCs in adult rodent SVZ may produce functional neurons in the olfactory bulb [ 150 ] . In the rat , TUDCA increases the proliferation and neural di ﬀ erentiation of NSCs in the SVZ , but not in the DG [ 149 ] . 5 . 2 . The Role of BA in Neurodegenerative Diseases Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by memory loss , dementia , and morphological changes in the brain and is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease . The main pathological feature of the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease is the accumulation of amyloid β peptides and tangles of tau protein [ 151 ] . The processing of amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) by β and γ secretases generates Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 9 of 20 amyloid β peptide [ 152 , 153 ] and the γ secretase complex includes presenilin 1 ( PS1 ) , which is associated with the maturation of V - ATPase , responsible for the acidiﬁcation of lysosomes . PS1 dysfunction , thus , leads to an impairment in lysosomal acidiﬁcation and function [ 154 , 155 ] . The accumulation of amyloid β peptides is relevant to the dysfunction of both APP and γ secretase , and APP / PS1 double knockout mice , which express both mutated human APP and PS1 , are used as a model of Alzheimer’s disease . Interestingly , TUDCA reduces the accumulation of amyloid β peptides in the hippocampus and frontal cortex and rescues memory deﬁcits in APP / PS1 double knockout mice [ 156 , 157 ] . In humans , plasma CA concentrations in patients with Alzheimer’s disease are signiﬁcantly lower than those in control subjects , and the TCA concentration in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease is also signiﬁcantly lower [ 42 ] . In contrast , the plasma concentration of LCA , a secondary BA , is signiﬁcantly higher in patients with Alzheimer’s disease than in controls [ 158 ] . Furthermore , it has been shown that the ratio of DCA ( secondary BA ) to CA ( primary BA ) in serum is signiﬁcantly higher in Alzheimer’s patients [ 159 ] . These studies indicate the relationship between BA and Alzheimer’s disease , and the importance of the brain - gut - microbiome axis . However , morphological and functional abnormalities in mitochondria have also been identiﬁed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease [ 160 , 161 ] . In ﬁbroblasts from Alzheimer’s disease patients , the mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ) is lower , and there is mitochondrial elongation . Dynamin - related protein 1 ( DRP1 ) plays an important role in mitochondrial ﬁssion and is essential for mitochondrial quality control [ 162 ] . Although the expression of DRP1 is lower in ﬁbroblasts from Alzheimer’s disease patients , UDCA increases its expression [ 163 ] . Parkinson’s disease is another common progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by tremors , muscle sti ﬀ ness , loss or impairment of voluntary movements , slowness of movement , and postural instability [ 164 ] . Mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog - induced putative kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and parkin are found in early - onset Parkinson’s disease and are important in the progression of Parkinsonism [ 165 – 168 ] . PINK1 and parkin initiate mitophagy and nuclear dot protein 52 kDa ( NDP52 ) , and optineurin are essential for this process [ 169 , 170 ] . 1 - Methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) and rotenone treatment have been widely used in the creation of a model of Parkinson’s disease . Both toxins inhibit complex I in mitochondria , leading to neuronal mitochondrial damage and Parkinsonism [ 171 , 172 ] . However , TUDCA protects neurons from MPTP - induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in the midbrain and striatum of mice [ 173 ] . TUDCA induces nuclear factor erythroid 2 - related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) expression and reduces the generation of reactive oxygen species , and indeed , this anti - oxidant e ﬀ ect of TUDCA may be Nrf2 - dependent [ 174 ] . Moreover , TUDCA ameliorates clinical signs induced by MPTP , such as the increase in swimming latency , foot - dragging , and tremors . In addition , TUDCA inhibits the loss of dopaminergic neurons and reduces the loss of MMP and mitochondrial mass elicited by MPTP [ 175 ] . Furthermore , TUDCA increases the expression of PINK1 , parkin , and the ratio of LC3 - II / lC3 - I , implying that TUDCA induces mitophagy [ 176 ] . In addition , in the rotenone - induced rat model of Parkinson’s disease , UDCA ameliorates abnormalities in the mitochondria of striatal neurons , such as irregular swelling and loss of cristae [ 177 ] . Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion encoding polyglutamine ( polyQ ) at the N - terminus of Huntingtin ( HTT ) . Huntington’s disease is characterized by motor dysfunction , cognitive decline , and psychiatric disturbances [ 178 , 179 ] . Chemical and genetic models of Huntington’s disease have been studied [ 180 , 181 ] . Firstly , 3 - nitropropionic acid ( 3 - NP ) is an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase ( complex II ) in mitochondria and induces degeneration of the caudate - putamen , which is also present in Huntington’s disease [ 180 ] . 3 - NP treatment is associated with swelling of striatal mitochondria , abnormal mitochondrial membrane structure , and apoptosis . However , TUDCA prevents mitochondrial damage and apoptosis and ameliorates the sensorimotor deﬁcits induced by 3 - NP [ 182 ] . Secondly , R6 / 2 transgenic mice possess a genomic fragment containing exon 1 of the human Huntingtin gene , which carries 144 CAG repeats , and are the most widely used model of Huntington’s disease [ 181 , 183 ] . In these mice , TUDCA prevents the striatal apoptosis and cerebral and striatal atrophy [ 184 ] . The accumulation of HTT and ubiquitin are also symptoms of Huntington’s disease , Biomolecules 2019 , 9 , 232 10 of 20 and ubiquitin is recruited to polyglutamine - expanded HTT fragments [ 185 ] . TUDCA reduces the accumulation of ubiquitin in the striatum of R6 / 2 transgenic mice and ameliorates their sensorimotor deﬁcits [ 184 ] . Amyotrophiclateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a progressiveand ultimately fatal diseasethat is characterized by the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons , leading to muscle weakness , atrophy , and paralysis [ 186 ] . Impairments in superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) , C9ORF72 , TAR DNA - binding protein of 43 kDa ( TDP - 43 ) , and fused in sarcoma ( FUS ) are molecular features of this disease [ 187 ] . Transgenic mice that carry the glycine 93 to alanine mutation of human SOD1 ( hSOD1 G93A ) are the most studied model of ALS [ 188 ] . NSC - 34 cells carrying hSOD1 G93A also represent a useful model of ALS - a ﬀ ected motor neurons [ 189 ] . Glycoursodeoxycholic acid ( GUDCA ) prevents the apoptosis of NSC - 34 cells carrying hSOD1 G93A [ 190 ] , and clinical trials of the use of TUDCA in patients with ALS have shown an improvement in muscle function and survival time , without adverse e ﬀ ects [ 191 ] . 6 . Concluding Remarks The existence of 20 BA in the brain has been demonstrated . These 20 BA include uncojugated BA ( CA , CDCA , DCA , and UDCA ) and conjugated BA ( GDCA , TCA , TDCA , and TUDCA ) , which are related to the brain physiology and / or to pathophysiology [ 6 ] . In addition , receptors and ion channels that are activated by BA are also expressed in this tissue . These ﬁndings imply that BA have a neurological function . The e ﬀ ects of several BA to protect against neurodegeneration are associated with inhibition of the accumulation of amyloid β peptides , mitochondrial damage , and apoptosis . However , BA have been shown to activate many receptors and ion channels , through which they may also play a neuroprotective role . Especially , TUDCA is the bile acid with the most diversity of actions on the human organism . Although the mechanism whereby TUDCA might induce adult neurogenesis remains unclear , it is possible that other BA also a ﬀ ect neurogenesis . Neuroprotective e ﬀ ects and the induction of adult neurogenesis represent important approaches to the therapy of neurogenerative diseases and brain injury . Both conjugated and unconjugated BA can enter the brain by crossing the BBB or using transporters . Moreover , UDCA , which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis [ 192 ] , can enter the cerebrospinal ﬂuid after oral administration [ 193 ] . Thus , the oral administration of BA may represent a feasible approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury in the future . Elucidation of the detailed mechanisms involved in the synthesis , signaling , and physiological functions of BA in the brain should help the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for brain diseases .
