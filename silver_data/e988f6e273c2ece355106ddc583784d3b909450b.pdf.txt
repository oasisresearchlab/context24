Olson , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX , and approved October 27 , 2008 ( received for review September 16 , 2008 ) From a large - scale screen using splicing microarrays and RT - PCR , we identiﬁed 63 alternative splicing ( AS ) events that are coordinated in 3 distinct temporal patterns during mouse heart development . More than half of these splicing transitions are evolutionarily conserved between mouse and chicken . Computational analysis of the introns ﬂanking these splicing events identiﬁed enriched and conserved motifsincludingbindingsitesforCUGBPandETR - 3 - likefactors ( CELF ) , muscleblind - like ( MBNL ) and Fox proteins . We show that CELF pro - teins are down - regulated > 10 - fold during heart development , and MBNL1 protein is concomitantly up - regulated nearly 4 - fold . Using transgenic and knockout mice , we show that reproducing the em - bryonic expression patterns for CUGBP1 and MBNL1 in adult heart induces the embryonic splicing patterns for more than half of the developmentally regulated AS transitions . These ﬁndings indicate that CELF and MBNL proteins are determinative for a large subset of splicing transitions that occur during postnatal heart development . CUGBP and ETR - 3 - like factors (cid:1) heart development (cid:1) muscleblind - like (cid:1) splicing microarray C oordinated control of alternative splicing ( AS ) on a genome - wide scale has the potential to drive proteome transitions with wide - ranging and critical biological consequences ( 1 , 2 ) . Disruption of splicing and its regulation , therefore , is implicated in disease causation and susceptibility ( 3 ) . Splicing is regulated by RNA - binding proteins that bind to cis - regulatory elements near the splice sites . Some of the best - characterized splicing regulators include the serine – arginine ( SR ) - rich family , hnRNP proteins , and the Nova , PTB , FOX , TIA , CUGBP and ETR - 3 - like factors ( CELF ) , and muscleblind - like ( MBNL ) families ( 4 , 5 ) . CELF and MBNL pro - teins were first characterized as factors involved in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy and were subsequently shown to be direct regulators of AS ( 6 – 8 ) . Recent advances in microarray and com - putational technologies have allowed comprehensive analyses of individual exons on a genome - wide scale , providing the ability to identify commonly regulated splicing events ( 9 – 12 ) . With some exceptions ( 13 , 14 ) , most large - scale analyses of regulated splicing have focused primarily on differences between adult tissues and tissues / cell cultures depleted for a splicing regu - lator rather than normal physiological transitions within a single tissue ( 9 – 11 , 15 ) . Developmental transitions provide an excellent opportunity to identify and determine the roles for coordinated splicing regulation associated with normal physiological change . The vertebrate heart is particularly attractive for such analysis because it undergoes extensive remodeling to meet the demands of increased workload in the developing organism ( 16 ) . In addition , the heart has relatively low cellular complexity and little cell turnover ( 17 ) so that developmental splicing transitions reflect changes occurring within individual cells to a greater extent than in many other tissues . The physiological changes that occur before and after birth are particularly important as the fetal heart adapts to birth and converts to adult function . This postnatal remodeling is accomplished through transcriptional and posttranscriptional net - works , including AS ( 16 , 18 ) . In the present study , splicing microarrays and computational screens were used to investigate regulatory networks of AS in vertebrate heart development . A large number of coordinated splicing transitions were identified that undergo dramatic changes during heart development . Strikingly , (cid:1) 60 % of the splicing transitions tested were conserved between mouse and chicken , supporting functional relevance to heart development . Computational and expression analyses , coupled with studies using transgenic and knockout mice identified cis elements and associated trans - acting factors that facilitate fetal - to - adult splic - ing transitions including those regulated by postnatal changes in CELF and MBNL protein expression . Together , these analyses identify and characterize a highly conserved and highly regulated program of AS that supports postnatal growth and maturation of the developing heart . Results Global Analysis of AS During Mouse Heart Development . To identify AS transitions during mouse heart development , we carried out a large - scale screen using alternative splice - event profiling microar - rays ( described in ref . 15 ) and literature searches followed by RT - PCR validation . Splicing microarrays were used to detect changes in splicing and mRNA steady - state levels of 10 , 111 muscle - and heart - enriched genes between embryonic day 17 ( E17 ) and adult mouse heart RNA ( supporting information ( SI ) Fig . S1 A ) . Predicted AS changes were validated by RT - PCR ( Fig . S1 B ) . We validated 147 splicing events that showed a (cid:1) 2 - fold change between E17 and adult heart by microarray analysis . We focused on 54 events from microarray analysis and 9 events from the literature validated by RT - PCR as exhibiting (cid:1) 20 - point change in percent inclusion of the variably spliced region between E14 and adult heart . Among the 63 events collected , 41 ( 65 % ) exhibited an increase , and 22 ( 35 % ) exhibited a decrease in inclusion of the variable region . Most variable regions ( 81 % ) were in - frame ( mul - tiples of 3 nt ) . The breakdown of different splicing modes ( e . g . , cassette exon , alternative 3 (cid:2) and 5 (cid:2) splice site , etc . ) is provided in Table S1 .

Linear regression analysis revealed no significant correlation ( R 2 (cid:3) 0 . 19 ) between the 2 datasets , indicating that different sets of genes are regulated by AS transitions or mRNA levels ( Fig . S1 C ) . Compar - ative gene ontology analysis showed that different but overlapping biological processes are associated with genes that undergo changes in splicing and those that undergo changes in mRNA levels ( Fig . S2 ) . Genes that undergo developmental splicing changes were enriched for cell structure and motility functions , but genes exhib - iting changes in mRNA levels were also enriched for signal trans - duction and oxidative ( lipid / steroid ) metabolism . These results demonstrate that during heart development , distinct subsets of genes are regulated by changes in splicing and by changes in transcript levels . Similar results have been demonstrated in com - parisons of splicing and mRNA profiles in adult tissues and during T cell activation ( 11 , 13 , 15 , 19 ) . Subsets of Splicing Transitions Are Coordinated at Specific Times During Mouse Heart Development . To determine whether splicing transitions are coordinated during mouse heart development , all 63 splicing events were assayed by RT - PCR using E14 , E18 , postnatal day 1 ( PN1 ) , PN3 , and adult ( 3 months ) heart RNA . These results were plotted both as percentage inclusion of the variable region ( s ) ( Fig . 1 A and B Upper ) to show the absolute change and as the percentage of total change ( Fig . 1 A and B Lower ) to identify the timingofmaximalchange . Thisanalysisidentifiedgroupsofsplicing transitions that are temporally coregulated . Splicing transitions were grouped as early or late depending on whether the maximal change occurred before or after birth , respectively . For example , 18 AS events exhibited a maximal increase in inclusion before birth ( Fig . 1 A ) whereas 12 exhibited an early decrease ( Fig . 1 B ) . Simi - larly , of 17 postnatal splicing transitions , 10 exhibited increased inclusion , and7exhibiteddecreasedinclusionofthevariableregion . Interestingly , 16 AS events exhibited biphasic transitions in which (cid:1) 20 % of the total change took place between E14 and E18 , (cid:4) 20 % occurred between E18 and PN1 , and (cid:1) 20 % occurred between PN1 and adult . The complete list of AS events assayed is provided in Table S2 . A Large Fraction of Splicing Transitions Are Conserved During Mouse and Chicken Heart Development . To determine the level of conser - vation , AS was assayed during chicken heart development by using orthologues of genes that exhibited changes in mouse and splicing events from the literature . A total of 114 AS events were tested , and 51 of them exhibited (cid:1) 20 - point change between E8 and adult chicken heart ( Table S3 ) . Next , we performed a developmental time course of AS in chicken heart using E8 , E12 , E16 , E20 , post hatch day 2 ( PH2 ) , PH7 , and adult hearts ( (cid:1) 6 months ) . Just as most splicing transitions in mouse could be grouped according to max - imal change relative to birth , most transitions during chicken heart development could be grouped by maximal change relative to hatching ( Fig . S3 ) . Direct comparison of 48 splicing transitions of variable mRNA regions that are conserved between mouse and chicken ( (cid:1) 60 % nucleotide identity ) revealed that 32 ( 66 . 7 % ) were alternatively spliced and that 30 ( 62 . 5 % ) of these were similarly regulated in that the AS patterns change in the same direction during development ( Fig . 2 A and Table S4 ) . Furthermore , 21 of the 30 AS transitions switched at comparable times during mouse and chicken heart development ( representative examples shown in Fig . S4 ) . Differences include 16 splicing events regulated only in 1 species and 2 transitions regulated in both species but in opposite directions . Gene ontology analysis of the 30 conserved AS transitions indicated that most genes participate in processes such as develop - ment , cell structure / motility , and muscle contraction ( Fig . 2 B ) . Genes in the development group were further analyzed for their annotated molecular function , showing that the majority of them encodecytoskeletal , signaling , ornucleicacid - bindingproteins ( Fig .

Binding Motifs for Known Splicing Factors Including CELF and MBNL Are Enriched and / or Conserved in the Flanking Introns of Develop - mentally Regulated Exons . Sequence motif analyses were conducted to identify putative regulatory elements in the flanking intronic regions of developmentally regulated exons in mouse and chicken . The first and last 250 bases of the upstream and downstream introns were used in these analyses with the exclusion of the core splice - site ( ss ) motifs ( 8 bases for 5 (cid:2) ss , 30 bases for 3 (cid:2) ss ) . Enrichment and evolutionary conservation of pentanucleotide motifs were analyzed in the 4 regions comparing to first - order Markov models that account for dinucleotide effects on abundance and conservation ( see SI Text ) . To identify motifs associated with splicing transitions occurring at specific times during heart development , a regression analysis between motif counts and AS changes at each time point was conducted for those pentamers that were significantly con - served or enriched . The most significant pentamers in the above analyses are displayed in Fig . 3 ( complete lists of significant motifs are included in Table S5 , Table S6 , Table S7 , Table S8 , Table S9 , and Table S10 ) . A number of motifs in each intronic region were identified including some that resemble the binding sites of known splicing factors . Two motifs in particular , GCAUG ( Fox ) and GUGUG ( CELF ) , located in the immediate downstream intronic region , were significant in all parameters examined : conserved among 8 mammalian species , enriched within this region in both mouse and chicken , andasignificantassociationwithspecifictemporalchanges ( increased exon inclusion late in development ) . The regression analysis of additional CELF and Fox motifs enriched or conserved , respectively , in this region also supports a role for these 2 proteins in regulating developmental AS changes , especially in the postnatal stages . Expression of CELF and Fox proteins during postnatal development are consistent with these results ( see below ) . Inter - estingly , CELF motifs were associated with increased exon inclu - sion when located in the first 250 bases of the downstream intron and decreased exon inclusion when located in the last 250 bases of the downstream intron . This pattern suggests that , like some other families of factors , the CELF family splicing factors may function to activate or repress splicing in a location - dependent manner ( 20 , 21 ) . The MBNL motif UGCGC was highly conserved in the last 250 bases of the upstream introns and was among the most significant motifs in the regression analysis being associated with decreased exon inclusion compared with both E14 and adult data at all 5 time points . PTB motifs were identified more often in the enrichment analysis ( in both mouse and chicken ) than in the mammalian conservation analysis , suggesting that PTB sites may evolve more quickly . The regression analysis identified an association between decreased exon inclusion with the ACUCC motif located in the first 250 bases of the upstream intron . Finally , CUAAC and ACUAA were highly conserved in multiple regions among mammals , and CUAAC in the first 250 bases of the upstream intron was associated with decreased exon inclusion . These motifs resemble the motif ( A ) CUAAC that was found to be associated with skeletal muscle - specific exons ( 12 , 22 ) , and binding motifs for STAR family proteins ( 23 ) . A Postnatal Expression of CELF , MBNL , and Fox Proteins Correlates with a Subset of AS Transitions . We found a significant enrichment / conservation of binding motifs for the CELF , MBNL , and Fox families flanking the developmentally regulated exons . The two CELF proteins expressed in heart , CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 , are expressed at low levels in adult compared with embryonic heart ( 24 ) . To determine the timing of CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 down - regulation in mouse heart development , we analyzed their protein andmRNAexpressionduringthefirst2weeksafterbirth . Asshown in Fig . 4 A , CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 protein levels begin to decrease by PN6 and PN10 , respectively . In contrast , MBNL1 protein levels begin to increase at PN5 , whereas no consistent change was evident in PTB levels . Strikingly , Fox - 1 protein was robustly up - regulated postnatally after PN6 , whereas Fox - 2 decreased slightly in adult Fig . 2 .

Western blot analysis of serially diluted PN1 protein samples compared with adult demonstrated (cid:6) 10 - , 18 - , and 3 - fold reductions in CUGBP1 , CUGBP2 , and Fox - 2 protein levels , respectively ( Fig . S5 ) . On the other hand , 10 - and 3 . 8 - fold increases were observed in Fox - 1 and MBNL1 proteins , respectively . In contrast to the loss of CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 proteins , their mRNA levels remained unchanged during this developmental period ( Fig . 4 B and C ) . These results indicate that steady - state CUGBP1 and CUGBP2proteinlevelsareregulatedposttranscriptionally , eitheratthe leveloftranslationorproteinstability ( orboth ) . Postnatalexpressionof Fox - 1 , Fox - 2 , and MBNL1 mRNAs paralleled their respective protein expression profiles ( Fig . 4 B and D ) . MBNL1 has been shown to undergo a cytoplasmic to nuclear transition during the first 3 weeks of postnatal skeletal muscle development ( 25 ) . To determine whether CUGBP1 , CUGBP2 , or MBNL1 differed in nuclear - cytoplasmic distribution during post - natal heart development , we prepared nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from PN2 and PN21 hearts . Loss of CUGBP1 protein at PN21 was seen only in the nuclear fraction , whereas the cytoplasmic levels remained unchanged ( Fig . 4 E ) . In contrast , CUGBP2 levels declined sharply in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions at PN21 . MBNL1 did not show nuclear accumulation as described in skeletal muscle but rather exhibited a small increase in the cytoplasmic fraction at PN21 . We conclude that MBNL1 is not primarily controlled by changes in nuclear - cytoplasmic distribution during heart development . In addition , our results suggest selective loss of CUGBP1 from the nucleus during heart development . CUGBP1 and MBNL1 Regulate Distinct as well as Overlapping Subsets of Postnatal AS Transitions . Next , we sought to determine whether postnatal splicing transitions coincided with the changes in CELF and MBNL protein expression observed during postnatal develop - ment . The timing of 10 postnatal AS transitions selected for detailed analysis ( 8 late and 2 biphasic ) demonstrated a good correlation with changes in CELF and MBNL1 protein expression . For instance , 8 of 10 AS transitions exhibited a maximal change after PN6 ( Fig . 4 F ) , the time at which CUGBP1 protein starts to decline and MBNL1 levels begin to rise . To establish causal relationships between CELF and MBNL protein expression and specific sets of AS transitions , we examined AS changes in adult hearts from mice overexpressing CUGBP1 or deficient in MBNL1 expression . Transgenic mice expressing Flag - tagged human CUGBP1 in a heart - specific and tetracycline - inducible manner were obtained by generating tet - inducible CUGBP1 ( TRECUGBP1 ) lines and crossing these with heart - specific rtTA lines - Myh6 - rtTA ( see SI Text ) . TRECUGBP1 / Myh6 - rtTA bitransgenic animals given doxycycline ( designated TgCUGBP1 ) expressed CUGBP1 protein 5 – 8 times above the endogenous levels in adult heart ( close to levels in PN1 heart ) and , importantly , MBNL1 levels were not altered in these heart tissues ( Fig . S6 A ) . MBNL1 is required for a subset of postnatal AS changes that occur during skeletal muscle development ( 25 ) . To investigate the contribution of MBNL1 in regulating AS transitions in the developing heart , we used the previously characterized Mbnl1 (cid:7) E3 / (cid:7) E3 knockout mice ( 26 ) . These mice exhibited no change in CUGBP1 protein levels in heart tissue from these mice ( Fig . S6 B ) . We compared 44 developmentally regulated AS changes in adult TgCUGBP1 mice ( (cid:8) and (cid:5) dox ) , Mbnl1 (cid:7) E3 / (cid:7) E3 mice and their respective wild - type littermate controls and identified 24 AS events that were altered by either increased expression of CUGBP1 and / or loss of MBNL1 ( Fig . 5 , all AS events screened are in Table S11 ) . Thirteen AS events exhibited a response only in CUGBP1 overex - pressing mice , 5 responded only in Mbnl1 (cid:7) E3 / (cid:7) E3 mice , and 6 responded in both TgCUGBP1 and Mbnl1 (cid:7) E3 / (cid:7) E3 mice ( Fig . 5 A – C and Fig . S7 A – C ) . All events reverted to the embryonic / early postnatal splicing pattern strongly suggesting that these events are primarily regulated by elevated CUGBP1 and / or decreased MBNL1 activity in the embryo / early postnatal heart . Interestingly , all splicing events regulated by both proteins exhibited antagonistic responses consistent with previous work ( 6 , 24 ) . Two AS events , Itga7 and VegfA , represent the 20 events that were unaffected by either CUGBP1 overexpression or Mbnl1 depletion ( Fig . 5 D and Fig . S7 D ) . Further supporting a determinative role for the postnatal expression of CUGBP1 and MBNL1 in regulating postnatal AS transitions , 18 of the 24 exons that responded to either CUGBP1 and / or MBNL1 normally undergo either late or biphasic postnatal transitions ( Table S11 ) . In addition , CELF - and MBNL - binding motifs are significantly enriched in the upstream and downstream introns flanking alternative exons regulated by CUGBP1 and MBNL1 , respectively ( Fig . 5 E – H ) . These data indicate that over half ( 24 of 44 ) of splicing events regulated during heart develop - ment are CUGBP1 - and / or MBNL1 - dependent , with the rest presumably affected by other splicing regulators . Discussion Conserved AS Transitions Are Part of the Remodeling Program During Heart Development . Cascades of transcriptional changes are known to coordinate regulatory networks during heart development ( 16 ) . Here , we present evidence that ensembles of variably spliced regions are also coordinately regulated during mouse and chicken heart development . Particularly striking is the extent ( (cid:1) 60 % ) to which the regulation of AS is conserved during heart development . This is in contrast to large - scale comparisons of orthologous gene Fig . 4 . PostnatalexpressionofCELF , Fox , andMBNLproteinscorrelatewithAS transitions . ( A ) Steady - state protein levels .

The unusually high level of conserva - tion observed here for both AS and its regulation most likely reflects enrichment of functional splicing events , in contrast to genome wide surveys that are blind to functional consequences . These results illustrate an advantage of performing analysis of splicing events associated with a specific physiological transition . Consistent with studies demonstrating that conserved splicing events tend to maintain reading frame ( 28 , 29 ) , 25 of the 32 ( 78 . 1 % ) splicing events conserved between mouse and chicken maintain the reading frame . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that the majority of these alternatively spliced isoforms have conserved functions . The nonconserved splicing transitions are also of interest as potential contributors to species - specific differences . Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis of conserved splicing transitions revealed particular enrichment for genes that are fundamental to the remodeling of cardiomyocytes during postmitotic growth , such as cytoskeletal rearrangement , nucleic acid binding and signaling . To supplement the GO analysis , we used literature searches to identify functions for 36 of the 44 genes tested in TgCUGBP1 and Mbnl1 (cid:7) E3 / (cid:7) E3 mice ( Fig . S8 ) . Some of the proteins expressed from these genes have diverse cellular functions but many ( 15 of 36 ) associate with contractile apparatus either within the Z - disk or via interactions with Z - disk structural or regulatory proteins . In both avian and mammalian hearts , the force generating capacity rises steeply during the first weeks after hatching or birth because of accumulation and structural reorganization of contractile proteins and a decrease in Ca 2 (cid:8) sensitivity ( 30 ) . The Z - disk forms the structural anchor for the sarcomere as the attachment point of the thin filaments and is crucial for communication of mechanosensory information between cells as the attachment points of costameric filaments ( 31 ) . We also found that several proteins ( 10 of 36 ) that undergo developmentally regulated splicing transitions have nucleic acid - binding properties . Six of these take part in RNA processing / metabolism , whereas 4 regulate transcription . Consistent with identification of several splicing regulators among the set of devel - opmentally regulated exons , we found examples of autoregulation and cross - regulation of splicing regulators . MBNL1 autoregulates splicing of its own exon 5 , which encodes an 18 - aa domain located within an ultraconserved segment ( 32 ) . This exon is included in fetal but not adult hearts of both mouse and chicken . Intriguingly , we find that the analogous exon in Mbnl2 ( exon 8 ) is also within an ultraconserved region , exhibits conserved regulation in mouse and chicken , and is regulated by both CUGBP1 and MBNL1 . CUGBP1 also cross - regulates splicing of the splicing regulator Fox - 2 , which is highly expressed in brain , skeletal muscle , and heart ( 33 ) . These observations agree with and extend previous findings that auxiliary splicing regulators tend to cross - regulate ( 10 , 25 ) . Postnatal Switch of CUGBP1 and MBNL1 Protein Expression Controls Fetal - to - Adult Transitions for a Subset of Splicing Events . CELF - and MBNL - binding sites were found to be enriched / conserved among developmentally regulated AS events in mouse . Only 2 of the 6 CELF genes ( CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 ) are expressed in heart and both proteins are down - regulated during heart development ( 24 , 25 ) . We demonstrated that CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 protein levels drop by PN6 and PN10 , respectively , and that regulation of both proteins is posttranscriptional .

Selective loss of nuclear CUGBP1 compared with CUGBP2 in 3 - week - old postnatal hearts suggests that CUGBP2 might use a different mechanism of down - regulation . Our results also indicate that MBNL1 expression is up - regulated during post - natal heart development via increased mRNA expression . Consistent with computational analyses showing enriched CELF - and MBNL - binding sites , we identified 24 developmentally regulated AS events that are sensitive to changes in the steady - state levels of CUGBP1 and / or MBNL1 in mouse heart . Thirteen of these events are CUGBP1 - specific , 5 are MBNL1 - specific , and 6 are antagonistically regulated by both CUGBP1 and MBNL1 . All 24 events revert to embryonic / early postnatal splicing patterns in adult hearts of TgCUGBP1 and / or Mbnl1 (cid:7) E3 / (cid:7) E3 mice . Eighteen of the 24 regulated exons undergo a postnatal switch , suggesting that they are normally regulated by CUGBP1 and / or MBNL1 . Most TgCUGBP1 mice exhibit severe heart failure and arrhythmias , causing high mortality rates . It remains to be determined which , if any , altered splicing event ( s ) phenocopy the cardiac defects seen in these mice . The cardiac phenotype of MBNL1 (cid:7) E3 / (cid:7) E3 mice remains tobecharacterized . BecausemisregulatedexpressionofbothCELF and MBNL is associated with misregulation of alternative splicing in myotonic dystrophy ( 35 ) , it will be interesting to determine to what extent this postnatal splicing network is disrupted in the disease .

Supporting Information Kalsotra et al . 10 . 1073 / pnas . 0809045105 SI Text Animals . Heart tissues were harvested from wild - type FvB mice and chickens ( White Leghorns ) at indicated time points and immediately frozen on dry ice for RNA extraction . Fertilized chicken eggs were purchased from Ideal Poultry . Cardiac tissues from adult Mbnl1 (cid:1) E3 / (cid:1) E3 , heterozygotes , and wild - type litter - mates ( 1 ) were kindly provided by Maurice Swanson ( University of Florida College of Medicine , Gainesville , FL ) . The TRECUGBP transgene contains the Flag - tagged human CUGBP1 - LYLQ isoform downstream from the tetracycline - inducible minimum CMV promoter . TRECUGBP transgenic mice ( FvB ) were mated to FVB / N - Tg ( Myh6 - rtTA ) 1Jam mice containing reverse transactivator driven by the (cid:1) - myosin heavy chain promoter ( 2 ) ( obtained from Mutant Mouse Regional Research Center ) to obtain TRECUGBP / Myh6 - rtTA bitrans - genic animals . TRECUGBP / Myh6 - rtTA bitransgenic animals ( 2 – 4 months of age ) were given 2 mg / ml doxycycline ( Clontech ) in drinking water with 5 % sucrose for 10 days . Cardiac tissues were collected 10 days after doxycycline administration . Most TgCUGBP1 animals die within 2 weeks due to cardiac abnor - malities after doxycycline administration . Detailed characteriza - tion of their cardiac phenotype is ongoing . Littermates of bitransgenic and Mbnl1 (cid:1) E3 / (cid:1) E3 animals were used for all exper - iments whenever possible . Splicing Microarrays . Genome and transcript sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Infor - mation in March , 2005 . We aligned RefSeq , mRNA , EST ( 3 ) , and patent transcripts to the genome using sim4 ( 4 ) and iden - tified all exons and exon – exon junctions . We also aligned human transcripts to the mouse genome to identify possible splice forms not yet present in mouse transcript databases . For the final array design , 10 , 111 genes were selected based on presence of an RNA - binding motif , expression in muscle or heart from previous experiments , and various other interests . An optimized 60 - nt probe was designed to monitor each exon , and a 36 - nt probe was centered across each exon – exon junction ( 5 ) . Exons (cid:2) 60 nt were monitored by using shorter probes attached to T - stilts . Probes predicted to perform poorly , such as those associated with repeat sequences or containing unacceptable GC - content , were dis - carded . In total , 248 , 316 oligonucleotide probes , including 110 , 367 and 93 , 382 exon and junction probes were synthesized to a 6 - array set , with each array containing 23 , 107 noncontrol probes . Arrays were ordered from Agilent Technologies . RNA Preparation and Hybridization . Total RNA for splicing mi - croarray analysis was prepared using RNeasy fibrous tissue kits ( Qiagen ) , and the quality was assessed spectrophotometrically ( Agilent ) at the microarray core facility at Baylor College of Medicine . PolyA (cid:3) RNA was isolated and amplified and the entire transcript labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 ( 5 ) and then hybridized in a dye - swamp replicate experiment . Gene and Alternative Splice Event Profiling . We determined gene expression by combing fold changes ( log10 ratios ) using error - weighted averaging of values from probes not associated with known alternative splicing . We identified mutually exclusive alternative splicing events in genomic alignments of RefSeq , GenBank , and dbEST transcripts , including cassette exons ( sin - gle and multiple ) , mutually exclusive exons , alternative 5 (cid:4) and 3 (cid:4) splice sites , and retained introns , and mapped probes to each form based on sequence identity . We calculated a log10 ratio and intensity for each form . If multiple probes reported on a single alternative splicing form , we combined log10 ratios using error - weighted averaging and calculated a median intensity . To esti - mate the proportion of a given splice form relative to the pool , we used the methodology of ref . 6 , using their optimal method , called ASPIRE 1 (cid:3) 2 . For a given alternative splice event , log - ratios monitoring event inclusion and exclusion are normal - ized by gene expression to isolate splicing changes from tran - scription changes . Normalized log - ratios monitoring inclusion and exclusion are compared . The output is a measure of the change in percentage of 1 splice form , such that a change from 80 % of total to 20 % of total of that form is reported as (cid:5) 60 . We assigned a P value and set quality control filters to remove events for which the gene intensities were at or below the noise level in either sample , for which the event intensities were at or below the noise level in both samples , and for which either the gene or event intensities were near saturation levels in either sample . We also consider a splicing event intensity (cid:6) 10 - fold higher than the gene intensity an indication of possible cross - hybridization and removed these . In true cases of 2 - isoform , differential alternative splicing , the log10 ratios monitoring the splice event inclusion and exclusion should have opposite signals ( after removing the gene expression effect ) ; we therefore re - moved those cases with intensities not consistent with this model . We calculated an uncertainty with each log ratio measurement and , using standard error propagation , calculated a P value for each splicing event monitored , representing the probability that the splicing event is not differentially regulated . RT - PCR Validation and Splicing Analysis . For RT - PCR assays , total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) . Microarray prediction data were used to design RT - PCR primers around potential splicing regions . One - Step RT - PCR reactions ( Invitro - gen ) were carried out by using specific primers on 0 . 5 (cid:2) g of total RNA samples obtained from mouse or chicken hearts at various stages of development . Upon gene - specific reverse transcription at 42 °C for 35 min , the PCR component involved 18 – 25 cycles of 95 °C for 45 min , 57 °C for 45 min , and 72 °C for 60 min . Percentage exon inclusion was calculated by using Kodak Gel logic 2200 and Molecular Imaging Software as : [ exon inclusion band / ( exon inclusion band (cid:3) exon exclusion band ) ] (cid:7) 100 . All bands of interest were gel - isolated , amplified , and confirmed by sequencing . Gene Ontology Analysis . Gene ontology analysis was performed by using PANTHER according to the guidelines from www . pan - therdb . org / . The distribution of the genes analyzed was com - pared with a reference list ( 10 , 111 genes on the microarray ) , and significant enrichment of the experimental data set in a given biological process was calculated by using binomial testing with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing as previously de - scribed ( 7 ) . Only processes with a significant ( P (cid:2) 0 . 05 ) enrich - ment were used for further analysis . The biological process ‘‘Development’’ with the highest significance score was then analyzed for molecular function by using PANTHER . Motif Conservation , Enrichment and Regression Analysis . Four in - tronic regions ( Fig . 4 ) flanking developmentally regulated al - ternative exons in mouse and chicken were analyzed for motif conservation , enrichment , and correlation with time course - splicing alteration . In each region , up to 250 bases from the corresponding exon – intron boundary were included . For introns Kalsotra et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 0809045105 1 of 11 (cid:2) 500 bases , only half of the intronic regions were used . To maximize the data size , which is a limiting factor in the motif analysis , all exons with (cid:6) 5 point change in percent inclusion were included in the conservation and enrichment analyses ( Table S2 and Table S3 ) . In the time course - splicing correlation analysis , only mouse exons that exhibited (cid:3) 20 - point change in percent inclusion were retained to achieve a relatively large range of splicing variability necessary for this analysis . Motif Conservation . We analyzed sequence conservation of pen - tamers in the mouse intronic regions to identify potential splicing regulatory elements . The mouse introns were aligned to 7 other mammalian genomes that have at least 5 (cid:7) sequence coverage in the UCSC 28 - way multigenome alignment ( REF : PMID 17984227 ) . For each pentamer in each region , a conservation rate ( CR ) was calculated as the fraction of aligned and conserved occurrences among total occurrences . The significance of CR of each pentamer is evaluated by comparing with 10 other pen - tamers with similar expected CR calculated using the first - order Markov model . This procedure essentially controls for possible sequence bias in the dataset . A P value was calculated by using the binomial distribution . Motif Enrichment . In this analysis , to account for background sequence biases , the introns corresponding to each region were binned according to their G (cid:3) C frequency into 10 groups . Expected pentamer frequency was calculated for each pentamer by using the first - order Markov model in introns of each G (cid:3) C group respectively . Pentamer enrichment was then evaluated by comparing the occurrence frequency of each pentamer to the overall expected frequency calculated by summing up the ex - pected counts of all G (cid:3) C groups . A P value was calculated by using the binomial distribution . Motif Regression Analysis . To identify splicing regulatory motifs potentially involved in regulating the time course - splicing changes during heart development , we used a regression - based approach . To limit the possibility of obtaining spurious results due to over - fitting , we performed regression analysis for pentamers that were significantly conserved or enriched . Thus , to quantify the splicing changes at E14 , E18 , PN1 , PN3 , and adult time points , we used 2 types of measures : ( i ) splicing changes at later time points relative to E14 ; ( ii ) splicing changes at earlier time points relative to the adult data . If we denote the splicing changes of all exons at 1 time point as y , then y is a vector of size N , where N is the number of exons . For the pentamer i in region j , we represent the count of this pentamer in this region as a vector ( size N ) x ij , then a linear regression model can be constructed as : y (cid:8) b ij (cid:7) x ij (cid:3) a ij , where a ij and b ij are scalars which were solved using reweighted least - squares minimization . A positive b ij means that the presence of more pentamer i in region j is associated with increasing exon inclusion ( denoted in green in Fig . 4 ) during heart development , and a negative b ij means that the presence of more pentamer i in region j is associated with decreasing exon inclusion ( denoted in red in Fig . 4 ) . The value of b ij reflects the extent of contribution by the pentamer i to the splicing changes in the exons under study when it occurred in region j . The significance of b ij can be evaluated by comparing its value with its expected standard error in the least - squares fit by using Student’s t distribution . We use the P value of b ij from this calculation as a measure of the significance of the correlation between the occurrence of pentamer i and splicing changes during heart development . Note that for time points E18 , PN1 , and PN3 , 2 P values were calculated relative to E14 and adult respectively , whereas only 1 P value each was calculated for E14 and adult phase . Significant regression P values ( P (cid:2) 0 . 05 ) are listed in Table S5 , Table S6 , Table S7 , and Table S8 . In addition , the time points associated with significant regressions can be inspected to determine whether the corre - sponding motif is associated with early , late or biphasic splicing changes . We used the rules delineated in Table S9 to deduce such patterns ( as labeled in Fig . 4 ) . However , note that an absence of significance does not preclude the possibility of the motif being associated with splicing changes at the corresponding develop - mental stage . Total , Nuclear , and Cytoplasmic Protein Preparation . Total proteins were extracted from mouse heart tissues by using a Dounce homogenizer in 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 32 M sucrose , 1 % SDS , 5 (cid:2) M MG132 , and 5 mM EDTA with protease inhibitors . After homogenization , the extracts were sonicated gently 3 times . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 15871 (cid:7) g on an Eppendorf 5424 bench - top centrifuge . Nuclear / cytoplasmic frac - tionation was performed by gently homogenizing tissue with a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer [ 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 10 mMMgCl 2 , 5mMKCl , 0 . 1mMEDTA , 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 , 0 . 2mM PMSF , 1 mM DTT , 1 (cid:7) Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture ( Roche ) , then centrifuging the homogenates at 3 , 000 (cid:7) g at 4 °C for 5 min to pellet nuclei . Supernatant ( cytoplasmic fraction ) was removed and added to 2 (cid:7) protein loading buffer . The nuclear pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer , spun at 3 , 000 (cid:7) g at 4 °C , and resuspended by sonicating 3 times directly in protein loading buffer . Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay ( Bio - Rad ) and the Non - interfering protein assay ( G - Biosciences ) . Western Blot Analysis . Fifty to 75 (cid:2) g of total , nuclear , or cytoplasmic proteins were separated by 10 % Tris - glycine SDS PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes ( Immobilon ) for Western blot analysis . The membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti - CUGBP1 antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; 3B1 ; Upstate ) or CUGBP2 ( 1 : 500 ; 1H2 , prepared in collaboration with Dr . Maurice Swanson ) con - jugated with HRP ( 8 ) , polyclonal anti - MBNL1 [ 1 : 1 , 000 ( 9 ) ] , mono - clonal anti - Fox - 1 ( 1 : 500 ; generated in - house ) polyclonal anti - Fox - 2 ( 1 : 1 , 500 ; generated in - house ) , PTB ( R164 ) , 1 : 1 , 000 ; generously provided by Doug Black ( University of California , Los Angeles ) , and monoclonal anti - GAPDH ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Biogenesis ) . Membranes were then washed and incubated at room temperature with HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Calbiochem ) or sheep anti - mouse ( 1 : 5 , 000 ; Jackson ) secondary antibodies for GAPDH . After appropriate washing in PBST ( 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) , immunoreactivity was detected by using HRP - chemiluminescence system ( Pierce ) . Real - Time Quantitative and Semiquantitative RT - PCR . Transcripts encoding CUGBP1 , CUGBP2 , MBNL1 , PTB , Fox - 1 , Fox - 2 , and GAPDH were amplified by using 0 . 5 (cid:2) g of RNA , One - Step RT - PCR kits ( Invitrogen ) , and transcript - specific oligonucleo - tides . Ethidium bromide - visualized products generated after 18 – 25 amplification cycles resolved on 5 % TBE - PAGE gels were quantified by using Kodak Gel logic 2200 and Molecular Imaging Software . Primer express software was used to design transcript - specific real - time quantitative PCR primers and fluorescent probes for CUGBP1 , CUGBP2 , Fox - 1 , and Fox - 2 . Standard curves were generated with known mass ( 40 ag to 4 pg ) of synthetic , transcript - specific amplicons . (cid:4) - Actin was used as an internal control . IDT DNA Technology synthesized all oligonu - cleotides . Template ( 200 ng of RNA or known mass of amplicon ) was subjected to reverse transcription in quadruplicate ( 10 (cid:2) l ) reactions containing 1 (cid:7) SSII buffer , 300 nM reverse primer , 500 (cid:2) M dNTPs , and 10 units of SuperScript II ( Invitrogen ) . Reverse transcriptase was omitted for the negative controls . Reverse - transcription conditions were 50 °C for 30 min and 72 °C for 5 min . We then added 40 (cid:2) l of PCR mix ( 1 (cid:7) PCR buffer , 300 nM forward primer , 300 nM reverse primer , 4 mM MgCl2 , 2 . 5 units of Taq polymerase , and 100 nM fluorogenic probe ) . Cycle threshold ( Ct ) values for cardiac tissue were (cid:2) 26 ; those (cid:6) 35 were considered nonspecific . Kalsotra et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 0809045105 2 of 11 1 .
