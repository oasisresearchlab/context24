REVIEW PAPER Yeast competence for exogenous DNA uptake : towards understanding its genetic component Petar Tomev Mitrikeski Received : 18 December 2012 / Accepted : 14 March 2013 / Published online : 26 March 2013 (cid:2) Springer Science + Business Media Dordrecht 2013 Abstract The demonstration of spontaneous yeast competence shows that artiﬁcial transformation rests on naturally occurring cellular processes . Such natural competence is either biologically mediated or envi - ronmentally induced . For instance , wild yeast might be transformed through conjugation by cell - to - cell contact mediated either by Escherichia coli or Agrobacterium tumefaciens . Moreover , natural com - petence can be enhanced by mechanical and physio - logical mechanisms . On the other hand , artiﬁcial yeast competence is usually achieved by biological , chem - ical and physical manipulations . These eliminate or weaken natural obstacles blocking the way of the transforming DNA in order to mitigate its entrance into the cell ( biological and chemical approach ) or simply to bridge it by either electrical or biolistic force ( physical ) . Thus yeast competence is controlled by intrinsic ( genetic ) and external ( environmental ) fac - tors . Both intrinsic and external parameters affecting yeast competence were scrutinized leading to the identiﬁcation of genes and biological processes participating in the phenomenon . Therefore natural yeast competence is a complex , quantitative genetic trait which may have allowed yeast to better adapt over evolutionary times .

DNA ) into a cell that results in a heritable change . 1 Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in both basic and applied genetic research . Consequently , its stable transformation is a distin - guished part of contemporary genetics with numerous and versatile applications ( Orr - Weaver et al . 1981 , 1983 ; Gunge 1983 ; Rothstein 1991 ; Akada 2002 ; Kawai et al . 2010 ) . However , to take up exogenous DNA yeast cell must ﬁrst be rendered competent . Usually artiﬁcial approaches , achieving excellent transforming efﬁciency due to highly elaborated P . T .

These efforts have shown that laboratory manipulations can strongly inﬂuence yeast transformability . Considerable amount of data pin - pointing various environmental properties affecting yeast competence have piled over time but yet no study has reviewed them comprehensively . On the other hand , budding yeast has been also reported naturally transformable ( Nevoigt et al . 2000 ) . The fact that yeast is capable for exogenous DNA uptake raises questions about its genetic mechanism . Due to screening the yeast deletion library for contribution to cell competence of each non - essential gene ( Kawai et al . 2004 ; Soltani et al . 2009 ) and also to analyzing yeast mutants defective in intracellular trafﬁcking and endocytotic / vacuolar acidiﬁcation ( Riechers et al . 2009 ) , an efﬁgy leading to better understanding of yeast transformation genetics is starting to rise . Both approaches have revealed numerous genes participat - ing in yeast competence and hence started to unravel the genomic contribution . Thus yeast competence here is seen as a complex genetic trait ( Johnston et al . 1981 ) affected by both the genome and its environment . This review is aiming to summarize known parameters ( genomic and environmental ) inﬂuencing yeast com - petence . Other reviews on fungal / yeast transformation have nicely encompassed many pertaining aspects including its historical development ( Fincham 1989 ; Gietz and Woods 2001 ; Kawai et al . 2010 ) . Historical echo Genetic transformation was initially reported more than 80 years ago ( Grifﬁth 1928 ) but , nevertheless , almost two decades had passed until it was proven that Grifﬁth’s ‘‘transforming principle’’ was DNA ( Avery et al . 1944 ) and another three until the ﬁrst artiﬁcially induced cell competence for DNA uptake was dem - onstrated ( Mandel et al . 1970 ; Cohen et al . 1972 ) . The possibility to transform the yeast S . cerevisiae by exogenous DNA was reported early ( Oppenoorth 1960 ) only to be disputed shortly after ( Harris and Thompson 1960 ; also see Oppenoorth 1962 ) , causing the matter to abate . More than one decade had passed until the problem was taken up again but , however , a more successful attempt went almost unnoticed ( Khan and Sen 1974 ) . Meanwhile a different group had reported transformation in another fungus ( Neuros - pora ) ( Mishra and Tatum 1973 ) . Finally , the ﬁrst reliable method for stable artiﬁcial transformation of yeast ( spheroplasts ) cells was demonstrated in the late seventies ( Hinnen et al . 1978 ; Beggs 1978 ) opening the molecular era in yeast genetics and establishing budding yeast as a leading eukaryotic model organism . A novel method surprisingly allowing transformation of intact yeast cell followed soon ( Iimura et al . 1983 ; Ito et al . 1983a , b ) and several years later became upgraded to achieve appreciable transformation efﬁ - ciency ( Schiestl and Gietz 1989 ) . Two decades later , natural DNA uptake was reported for yeast ( Nevoigt et al . 2000 ) , shifting the attention from efforts to perfect the technology to understanding the process of yeast competence itself . Current identiﬁcation of several gene groups and / or processes ( Kawai et al . 2004 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ; Soltani et al . 2009 ) contributing to the phenomenon of yeast competence promises a better understanding of both natural and artiﬁcially induced transformation competence with evolutionary and technical potential . Yeast competence for exogenous DNA uptake Many approaches now exist that allow routine yeast transformation using in vitro manipulated DNA for either research or industrial purposes . Thus yeast cell could be rendered competent for DNA uptake by ( i ) biological , ( ii ) chemical , ( iii ) physical , and ( iv ) miscellaneous approaches . On the other hand starved yeast cells could become competent if under low - nutrient conditions metabolizing only sugars . This process was therefore called natural transformability ( Nevoigtetal . 2000 ) . Seenthisway , onemightspeculate that natural yeast competence could be dramatically increased by manipulating environmental conditions . Therefore , it is important to better understand both genetic and environmental components contributing to yeast competence for exogenous DNA uptake . Transformation efﬁciencies or frequencies are usually expressed as the number of transformants per microgram of DNA ( t / l g DNA ) or as the percentage of viable cells transformed ( transformation efﬁciency per viable cell number ) , respectively . Artiﬁcial yeast competence The ﬁrst widely used protocol for yeast transformation involved enzymatic removal of the cell - wall in order 1182 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 to produce yeast spheroplasts ( protoplasts ) ( biological approach ) ( Hinnen et al . 1978 ; Beggs 1978 ; Gerbaud et al . 1979 ; Hsiao and Carbon 1979 ) ( Table 1 ) . Yeast spheroplasts incubated in polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) / CaCl 2 medium are then stably transformed leading to efﬁciency of 1 – 10 , 5 9 10 3 – 2 9 10 4 , or 5 9 10 2 – 5 9 10 3 t / l g DNA by integrative ( YIp ) , episomal ( YEp ) , or replicative / centromeric ( YRp / YCp ) double - stranded ( ds ) plasmids , respectively ( Struhl et al . 1979 ) . Use of sonicated carrier DNA increases trans - formation efﬁciency by both replicating and integrat - ing plasmids either in circular or linear form ( Orr - Weaver et al . 1983 ; Burgers and Percival 1987 ) . However , respective transformation efﬁciencies with replicative ( [ 10 5 t / l g DNA ; Sˇtafa et al . 2005 ; personal unpublished data ) and integrative ( usually [ 10 2 and occasionally up to even 10 3 t / l g DNA ; personal unpublished data ) plasmids ware achieved even with - out utilization of carrier DNA . Contrary to ds , single stranded ( ss ) - DNA transforms yeast cells 2 - to 5 - fold ( Burgers and Percival 1987 ) or even 10 - to 30 - fold more frequently ( Singh et al . 1982 ) and requires no presence of homology during integrative transforma - tion ( Gjuracˇic´ and Zgaga 1996 ) . The main disadvan - tage of this approach is the possibility of spheroplast fusion effected by cytoplasmic mixing that could be followed by nuclear fusion ( van Solingen and van der Plaat 1977 ; Harashima et al . 1984 ) . However , sphe - roplast fusion can be largely avoided by condition modiﬁcation ( Burgers and Percival 1987 ) . Thus mainly by rapid spheroplasting at low cell concentra - tions ( 5 9 10 7 – 10 8 / ml ) , transforming at low cell concentrations ( 1 – 5 9 10 8 / ml ) , and avoiding unnec - essary steps leading to spheroplast damaging , these authors managed to decrease the cell fusion by a factor of 2 9 10 2 to even 10 3 ( compare Harashima et al . and Burgers and Percival ) . A simpliﬁed technology capable of transforming intact yeast cells was developed only a few years later ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ) ( chemical approach ) ( Table 1 ) . This protocol achieves competence for DNA uptake by the aid of PEG and monovalent alkali metal cations . The initial low transformation efﬁciency of up to 10 2 t / l g DNA ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ) was subsequently dramatically improved to result in [ 1 9 10 6 t / l g DNA by the use of ss - carrier DNA ( Schiestl and Gietz 1989 ; Gietz et al . 1995 ) . Today , the lithium acetate LiAc / SS - DNA / PEG protocol is the most frequently used yeast transformation procedure . Modiﬁcations of LiAc / SS - DNA / PEG protocol are used for high efﬁciency transformation of frozen competent yeast cells ( Gietz and Schiestl 2007a ) , for transformation in 96 - well microtiter plates ( Gietz and Schiestl 2007b ) , for high yields of transformants ( Gietz and Schiestl 2007c ) , for quick transformation when no high yields are needed ( Gietz and Schiestl 2007d ) , and for Library screen transformation ( Gietz and Schiestl 2007e ) . Moreover , this protocol is known to be effective in transforming even ﬂocculating yeast with efﬁciency of above 10 3 t / l g of DNA ( Venaˆncio et al . 1999 ) . However , this approach still includes one important disadvantage . Namely , ss - vectors transform even 1 , 000 - fold less efﬁ - cient compared to ds - vectors ( Gietz et al . 1995 ) . Two physical approaches are used to deliver DNA into the cell , electroporation and biolistic ( Table 1 ) . Electroporation renders the cell - wall / membrane tran - siently porous and thus competent for DNA uptake . Both , spheroplasts ( Karube et al . 1985 ) and intact yeast cells ( Delorme 1989 ) can be transformed by electroporation . Initial transformation efﬁciency of 10 3 – 4 . 5 9 10 3 t / l g DNA ( Delorme 1989 ) has much improved to 2 – 5 9 10 5 t / l g DNA for episomal plasmids ( Becker and Guarente 1991 ) or even 5 9 10 6 t / l g DNA when a combination of PEG / ss - carrier DNA is used ( Manivasakam and Schiestl 1993 ) . Electroporation is particularly useful for trans - formation of yeast cells in stationary phase form cultures refrigerated for up to 6 weeks ( Grey and Brendel 1992 ) . The biolistic procedure ( or ‘‘particle gun’’ ) uses metal microbeads coated with DNA , which are appropriately accelerated and shot into the cell ( Johnston et al . 1988 ; Armaleo et al . 1990 ) . Optimized procedure can lead to transformation frequency between 10 - 5 and 10 - 4 . This method is the only way to transform cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria ( Johnston et al . 1988 ; Bonnefoy and Fox 2007 ) and is very helpful with plants and some other model organisms . The approaches described above share one com - mon characteristic : optional or obligate use of carrier DNA . Usually , the carrier is ss - DNA from heterolo - gous source ( salmon sperm or calf thymus ) in order not to share extensive homology with the host genome whilst increasing the efﬁciency . However , two studies on illegitimate recombination in yeast revealed its potential mutagenicity . Using cell fusion non - support - ive spheroplasts procedure ( Zgaga et al . 1991 ) , Gjuracˇic´ and Zgaga ( 1996 ) showed that both Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1183 123 T a b l e 1 M e t ho d s o f a r ti ﬁ c i a l c o m p e t e n ce i n y ea s t S . ce r ev i s i a e A pp r o ac h / M e t hod C e ll t yp e V e h i c l e E nh a n ce r s E f ﬁ c i e n c y / F r e qu e n c y D i s a dv a n t a g e S p ec i ﬁ c it y R e f e r e n ce B i o l og i ca l S ph e r op l a s t - m e t hod S ph e r op l a s t P E G / C a 2 ? ss - c a rr i e r DN A * 10 4 S ph e r op l a s t f u s i on E f ﬁ c i e n t ss - DNA t r a n s f o r m a ti on H i nn e n e t a l .

Moreover , ss - plasmid can integrate in multiple tandem repeats in as much as two - thirds of the transformants . Arising by illegitimate recombination such transformants can generate signiﬁcant changes in the karyotype ( Gjur - acˇic´ and Zgaga 1996 ) . Furthermore , if diploidized this transformants show signiﬁcant reduction in sporula - tion efﬁciency and spore viability ( Gjuracˇic´ and Zgaga 1998 ) . Finally , there are various approaches , which are modiﬁcations of the main procedures , usually achiev - ing lower transformation efﬁciency ( Table 1 ) . Yeast can be transformed using PEG - only ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) , PEG / Heat shock ( Stateva et al . 1991 ; Hayama et al . 2002 ; Chaustova et al . 2008 ) , PEG / freezing - thawing ( Klebe et al . 1983 ) and after incubation in PEG , triacetin or glycerol , and cations such as Li ? , Ca 2 ? , Mg 2 ? ( Keszenman - Pereyra and Hieda 1988 ) . All of this approaches reveal average transformation efﬁciency of [ 10 3 t / l g of either episomal or replica - tive plasmids except PEG - only where efﬁciency of only 10 2 t / l g of episomal DNA was reported . More - over , few early reports emphasize the role of cations in achieving yeast transformation through laboratory manipulations . Freshly grown cells were incubated with foreign DNA at 37 (cid:3) C for 5 min in a solution of 5 l M MgCl 2 and plated on selective medium leading to transformation in frequencies that were dependent on the growth phase ( Khan and Sen 1974 ) . In a different assay , a suspension of bacterial cells treated with lysozyme under osmotically stabilized condi - tions , rich in Ca 2 ? ions combined with a short heat shock , was used instead of standard transforming DNA solution from Albert Hinnen’s protocol accom - plishing transformation efﬁciency of 10 3 – 10 4 t / l g of episomal DNA ( Broach et al . 1979 ) . Both procedures used transforming solutions enriched with cations , either Ca 2 ? or Mg 2 . This suggests that yeast compe - tence can be achieved through positively charged ions . However , in Broach’s attempt it is not clear whether the competence was mediated through conjugation ( although treatment with lysozyme may have lysed the bacterial cells ) or by cation - aided DNA uptake . Therefore , although this could be treated as a case of artiﬁcial yeast competence , its actual vehicle stays elusive . In contrast to bacteria where transforming DNA only needs to enter the cell , in eukaryotes the DNA needs to enter the nucleus for successful transforma - tion . Therefore , on its way to the nucleus exogenous DNA needs to overcome several natural obstacles . The ﬁrst obstacle , the cell - wall , is either enzymatically eliminated ( spheroplast method ) , rendered pervious for DNA ( LiAc - or other chemical - methods ) or is overcome by applying physical force ( physical approach ) . However , once through the cell - wall , DNA still needs to pass the cell - membrane . Although there could be other routes ( see below ) , it is a general opinion that DNA can cross the membrane by endocytosis or endocytosis - like process ( Kawai et al . 2004 , 2010 ) except when physical approaches are used . Therefore , the ability to engulf DNA might be seen as an active contribution of the cells required for successful transformation . Following uptake , DNA must evade possible degradation in the cytoplasm and needs to be delivered to the nucleus . Likely , also these later steps in transformation are similar for biological and chemical approaches and require active cellular processes . In contrast , physical approaches , in partic - ular biolistic , seem entirely independent of such natural cellular processes even during middle / late steps . Natural yeast competence Since there is no known genetic program allowing exogenous DNA uptake in yeast analogous to widely spread natural genetic transformability in bacteria ( Kru¨ger and Stingl 2011 ) , the prevailing view seems to be that yeast does not take DNA naturally . However , there are several reports showing that non - manipu - lated yeast cells are naturally transformable under laboratory conditions . Also , in support of occasional spontaneous DNA uptake , evidence of horizontal gene transfer was recently obtained ( Kurland et al . 2003 ) . Although proven cases of horizontal gene transfer remain limited , they might have importantly contrib - uted to genomic innovation , plasticity and even adaptation to a particular ecological niche ( see Fitz - patrick 2012 ) . Thus horizontally transferred genes coming from bacterial or eukaryotic source ( s ) had contributed to acquiring novel functions in yeast , important for their ability to synthesize biotin , utilize sulphate and for anaerobic growth ( Hall et al . 2005 ) as well as for wine fermentation , cellular transport and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1185 123 stress responses ( Novo et al . 2009 ; Cappello et al . 2010 ) . Earlier , Koufopanou et al . ( 2002 ) showed that horizontal gene transfer is typical for VDE , a homing endonuclease ( selﬁsh element ) from S . cerevisiae that appears to be evolutionary adapted to spreading laterally . Therefore growing evidence of horizontal gene transfer in lower eukaryotes suggests the exis - tence of natural mechanisms for occasional uptake of exogenous DNA . Some authors have brieﬂy discussed possible mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer in wild yeast strains mainly pointing to natural transformability shown by Nevoigt et al . ( Hall et al . 2005 ; Fitzpatrick 2012 ) . The artiﬁcial yeast transformability routes ( via PEG / ions , mechanical or even electrical damage ) were also discussed as plausible in natural yeast environ - ments ( Hall et al . 2005 ) . Mediated natural yeast competence Mediated yeast transformation requires help by another species , usually bacterial , that has a possibility to transfer DNA via direct cell - to - cell contact ( Table 2 ) . The simplest form of such genetic exchange is between strains of opposite sex , in which a selectable plasmid is transmitted from one partner to the other ( Suzuki and Yoshida 1986 ) . This was called stepwise transformation by cytoduction and required simple streaking of both strains on a selective plate and overnight incubation for mating during which process plasmid was reported to pass from one strain to the other . Thus due to necessity of mating this approach is limited to strains with opposite sex . Yeast has also been transformed via conjugation by Escherichia coli ( Heinemann and Sprague 1989 ; Nishikawa et al . 1990 ) and through Agrobacterium - mediated DNA transfer ( Piers et al . 1996 ) . Contrary to artiﬁcial transforma - tion , such trans - kingdom genetic exchange requires physical contact , viable donor cell and presence of a speciﬁc plasmid within the donor cell . Another expected characteristic is ss - DNA transfer . To achieve genetic exchange between E . coli and S . cerevisiae , freshly grown donor ( bacteria ) and recipient ( yeast ) cells usually suspended in TNB buffer ( 0 . 05 M Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 05 % NaCl ) are mated either by simple mixing ( Heinemann and Sprague 1989 ) or by plating on ﬁlter membrane disks ( nitrocellulose / cellulose acetate ) ( Nishikawa et al . 1990 ) in donor : recipient ratio of 1 : 10 followed by plating on appropriate medium . These approaches usually lead to transmission frequency that ranges between 3 9 10 - 8 and 5 9 10 - 5 ( Heinemann and Sprague 1989 ) or even between 10 - 5 and 10 - 3 per recipient cell ( Nishikawa et al . 1990 ) . Thus using the bacterial conjugation machinery and engineered yeast plasmid systems researchers have managed to shufﬂe and / or target alleles in yeast ( Sikorski et al . 1995 ; Nishikawa and Yoshida 1998 ) and transfer YACs to yeast ( Mahmood et al . 1996 ) . Also , trans - kingdom conjugation was successfully performed between bacterial chromosomeless mini - cells and yeasts ( Fukumaru and Yoshida 2000 ) and applied to other fungi ( Hayman and Bolen 1993 ; Inomata et al . 1994 ) , promising further development of this technology . Agrobacterium - mediated transformation is con - sidered to be essentially similar to bacterial conju - gation . Here too , the usual procedure includes co - cultivation of the bacterial donor with the recipient yeast cells on a ﬁlter pad placed on a solid medium containing inducing agents for the Agrobacterium virulence genes ( Bundock et al . 1995 ; Piers et al . 1996 ; Sawasaki et al . 1996 ; Hooykaas et al . 2006 ) . The most elaborated protocol provides a donor : re - cipient ratio of 1 : 100 ( Hooykaas et al . 2006 ) . These initial approaches lead to successful DNA transfer from A . tumefaciens to S . cerevisiae producing transmission frequency between 10 - 6 ( Bundock et al . 1995 ) and even 10 - 3 ( Piers et al . 1996 ) for binary vectors and between 10 - 8 and 10 - 6 for biparental mating ( Sawasaki et al . 1996 ) . Today , Agrobacterium - mediated transformation ( AMT ) is used for replicative or integrative transformation in yeast ( Bundock et al . 1995 ) and also for in vivo recombineering applicable to any vector ( Takken et al . 2004 ) . Moreover , integrative AMT could be targeted ( Bundock et al . 1995 ) or random ( van Attikum et al . 2001 ) . Therefore , AMT seems to offer advantages over other genetic - transformation protocols in many non - plant species ( Michielse et al . 2005 ) . Interestingly , although not perfected yet , recently AMT was applied as a 96 - well - microtiter - plate - procedure adopted for large - scale transforma - tion of yeast ( Soltani et al . 2009 ) and some researcher predict ‘‘ … a bright future for Agrobac - terium as a universal tool for genetic transformation of all organisms . ’’ ( Lacroix et al . 2006 ) . 1186 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 Induced natural yeast competence Several independent reports suggest that yeast could be renderedcompetent inecologicalconditionswithout the aid of livingmediators ( Table 2 ) . Here , the natural yeast competence could be induced either physiologically or mechanically . A case of physiologically induced natural competence in yeast was reported by Nevoigt et al . ( 2000 ) . Freshly grown yeast cells were simply washed with two volumes of 0 . 85 % NaCl and re - suspended in 1 M sucrose to which episomal plasmid DNA was added . Themixturewas subsequentlyincubatedwithout shaking and transformants were screened on selective medium . This kind of competence was also induced by other carbon sources , such as 1 M glucose and 1 M fructose , and was completely abolished by adding rich or minimal media to the sugar solution , suggesting that the competence was indeed physiologically actuated . Thisapproach , however , leadstoefﬁciencyofonly1 – 10 t / l g DNA . Having this in mind , earlier disputed results from Oppenoorth ( 1960 ) could be also explained as physiologically stimulated natural yeast competence . There , total DNA isolated from a donor yeast strain was simply taken up in appropriate wort ( medium composed of sugars used by the fermenting yeast culture as carbon source during brewing ) to which a recipient yeast strain was later added . The recipient yeast was not able to metabolize certain sugars . However , after growing within the wort contaminated by the DNA from the donor , which was able to ferment the sugars , the recipient strain gained the ability to grow on these sugars . Therefore , it seems plausible to treat this as physiologically impelled natural yeast competence . Furthermore , natural yeast competence could also be induced mechanically . Freshly grown cells , during any phase of the cycle , mixed with plasmid / carrier DNA vigorously vortexed over 30 s with sterile glass beads in osmotically supportive medium and imme - diately plated on appropriate selection medium pro - duced between 20 and 1 , 000 t / l g DNA ( Costanzo and Fox 1988 ) . Due to its simplicity , the authors also foresaw this process happening in natural conditions . Miscellaneous reports of possible natural yeast competence Early log phase yeast cells could be rendered competent bythe aid of PEG - only suggestingthatthisphenomenon could be denoted as ‘‘natural transformation’’ due to T a b l e 2 T yp e s o f n a t u r a l c o m p e t e n ce i n y ea s t S . ce r ev i s i a e T yp e M e d i a t o r / R ou t e V e h i c l e E f ﬁ c i e n c y / F r e qu e n c y S p ec i ﬁ c it y A pp li ca b ilit y R e f e r e n ce M e d i a t e d E . c o li D i r ec t ce ll - t o - ce ll c on t ac t 10 - 3 ss - DNA t r a n s f e r V e r s a til e w it h d e v e l op i n g po t e n ti a l H e i n e m a nn a nd S p r a gu e ( 1989 ) ; N i s h i k a w a e t a l .

PEG - only competence in yeasts and bacteria , involving possible concomitant cell - wall damage due to freezing - thawing , was also demonstrated earlier ( Klebe et al . 1983 ) . However , as also discussed by Hayama et al . , it remains controversial whether this is natural competence . Having said this , it is worth summoning again the cation - and / or cation / heat shock - aided trans - formation achieved either by Khan and Sen or Broach et al . There , the environment leading to transformation could also occur naturally . Whether we should treat these cases as natural or artiﬁcial transformation remains open . Nevertheless , cases such as these clearly broaden the spectrum of circumstances that could possibly lead to yeast transformation in the natural environment . Taken together , these data clearly show that yeast could be rendered competent for exogenous DNA uptake under ecological conditions relevant in its natural environment ( s ) . But why should a unicellular eukaryote such as yeast be naturally transformable ? Natural transformation in bacteria contributes to higher genetic biodiversity improving the ﬁtness of the population and thus it could be looked at as a substitute for sexual reproduction ( i . e . parasexuality ; Maynard Smith et al . 1991 ; Denamur et al . 2000 ; Kohiyama et al . 2003 ) . In eukaryotes this role is fulﬁlled by meiosis and subsequent random gamete fusion . Yeast is a unicellular organism with a predominantly diplontic life style and vertical gene transfer . However , bioinformatic analysis suggests that some important features of its genome , such as ability to grow under anaerobic conditions ( Hall et al . 2005 ) , have their origin in horizontal gene transfer ( see Fitzpatrick 2012 ) . In summary , natural compe - tence in wild yeast under ecological conditions might be an important contribution to its evolution . This might also be true for other unicellular eukaryotes or even lower multicellular eukaryotes such as sexless bdelloid rotifers ( Smith 1986 ) . Moreover , higher - plant cell might be also naturally transformable since horizontal transfer of genetic material was reported during tissue grafting ( Stegemann and Bock 2009 ) . Natural - competence - based transfection in yeast Yeast cell was ﬁrst transfected by non - viral DNA transfer relatively recently ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ) . Simple procedure was utilized : freshly grown intact cells were soaked in distilled water making them competent for transfection , after which were incubated with exogenous DNA in an osmotically supportive medium ( 34 % sucrose ) and subsequently shifted to a hypotonic medium ( distilled water ) leading to com - petence . By this procedure average transfection rate ranging between 0 . 5 9 10 - 7 and 0 . 1 9 10 - 7 but still near to the detection limit was achieved . However , use of chloroquine enhanced the efﬁciency to even 14 . 9 9 10 - 7 ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ) . Such approach has established itself as a main experimental proce - dure utilized in analyzing general intracellular traf - ﬁcking in yeast ( Riechers et al . 2009 ; Riechers et al . 2010 ) with successful application to mammalian cell as well ( Neukamm et al . 2006 ) . It seemed plausible to treat this approach as artiﬁcial yeast competence mainly due to the use of transfection enhancers such as chloroquine . However , it is worth noticingthatthismethodwasindeeddevelopedutilizing natural yeast competence ( Nevoigt et al . 2000 ) . There - fore , since yeast transfectants are also present with no enhancers , theapproachofNeukammetal . couldbealso regarded as natural yeast competence . Here , it is forth discussing one obvious terminolog - ical redundancy that might lead to fundamental fussiness . Traditionally , transfection represents a pro - cess of introducing DNA into eukaryotic cell via viral vehicle . On the other hand , non - viral uptake of naked DNA into a cell is called transformation and usually all such DNA transfer into bacterial , lower eukaryotic ( non - animal ) and plant cell is congruently designated . However , according to modern authors , transfection could be achieved by either viral or non - viral method ( s ) ( Kim and Eberwine 2010 ) . Neukamm et al . have also discussed their method as non - viral transfection in yeast . Obviously , this terminological redundancy might seem historically and / or methodo - logically exculpated . However , in order to circumvent possible confusion , here all non - viral transfer of DNA into a cell will be called transformation according to the traditional deﬁnition . Except in this chapter , the discussed natural - competence - based transfection in yeast will be simply referred to as Neukamm’s method . Parameters affecting yeast competence It is a common laboratory experience that not all yeast strains are equally transformable . Regardless of the applied method some strains are notoriously difﬁcult 1188 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 to transform whereas for others high transformation efﬁciency is easily achieved ( Johnston et al . 1981 ; Orr - Weaver et al . 1983 ; Bruschi et al . 1987 ; Lauermann 1991 ; Schiestl et al . 1993 ; Soni et al . 1993 ; Hayama et al . 2002 ; Kawai et al . 2004 ) . Therefore genetic variation between yeast strains could be held respon - sible for the different cell competence . Conversely , this variability emphasizes the important genetic contribution of the strain backgrounds , and supports the notion of natural yeast competence as evolutionary important factor . An early study has shown that yeast competence is a recessive polygenetic trait ( Johnston et al . 1981 ) . Nevertheless , genetic variation underly - ing yeast competence is poorly understood , despite recent efforts to provide more insight into its genetic requirements ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ; Soltani et al . 2009 ) . Also , experience from decades of artiﬁcially induced competence in yeast allows us to understand which conditions favor exogenous DNA uptake . Therefore , yeast competence for exogenous DNA uptake is affected by genetic and non - genetic parameters . Genetic parameters Not all genetic factors inﬂuencing yeast competence / transformation rates can be attributed with certainty to a particular cellular feature and / or process , but some that are shall be discussed here . Recently a correlation between the maximum cell - wall porosity , observed in growing yeast culture predominantly composed of budded cells , was reported with the highest competence being correlated with morphological changes in the cell - wall ( Chaust - ova et al . 2008 ) . Also other studies found yeast competence altered by mutations particularly affect - ing cell - wall / membrane characteristics . Increased competence was reported in acr mutants resistant to aculeacin A , which inhibits ß - glucan synthesis ( Gal - lego et al . 1993 ) ( Table 3 ) . One mutant , acr2 , was found to posses increased competence when trans - formed with episomal , centromeric and integrative circular but not linear plasmids . However , it should be noticed that possible ACR2 gene has not been phys - ically mapped in the systematic sequence of yeast strain S288C ( see http : / / www . yeastgenome . org / ) . Furthermore , the cell - surface of high - competence mutant spf1 was shown to absorb more transforming DNA then wild - type ( wt ) cells ( Pham et al . 2011a ) .

( 2002 ) ( ho w e v e r , non - i s og e n i c s t r a i n s a r e c o m p a r e d ) Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1191 123 That this is likely a cell - wall property was further shown when spf1 spheroplasts had normal transfor - mation efﬁciency ( Pham et al . 2011a ) . Moreover , mutation of the PDE2 gene was shown to cause high - competence ( Kawai et al . 2004 ) . Thus yeast strain with deleted PDE2 gene experienced competence elevated for up to 35 - fold with additional increment if SRB gene was non - functional as well but srb - mutant alone showed increased competence of only 7 - fold ( Tomlin et al . 2000 ) . Pleiotropic mutation designated as srb1 - 1 is known to produce impaired cell - wall with altered mannan - and glucan - structures ( Maerkisch et al . 1983 ; Blagoeva et al . 1991 ; Stateva et al . 1991 ) . PDE2 overexpression rescues sorbitol - dependence and due to sharing phenotypes ( among them enhanced trans - formability ) with srb mutants , known for their fragile cell - wall , it was suggested that Ras / cAMP - signal pathway might modulate cell - wall properties ( Tomlin et al . 2000 ) . Moreover , that proper function of the cell - membrane might be also very important for compe - tence was suggested by Kawai et al . ( 2004 ) discussing decreased competence in sin3 deletant . SIN3 is involved in histone deacetylation and earlier was shown that the mutants lack phosphatidylethanol - amine ( PE ) in their membranes ( Elkhaimi et al . 2000 ) . That leaded to a proposal that PE affects membrane properties ( Birner et al . 2001 ) . Accordingly , previ - ously it was shown that the srb1 - 1 mutation spreads its effects also to the membrane causing disturbances in its lipid composition ( Stateva et al . 1991 ) . However , substantial breakthrough has been achieved when Kawai et al . ( 2004 ) , using the simple PEG / Heat shock method developed by Hayama et al . ( 2002 ) , systematically transformed approximately 4 , 800 yeast strains mutated in one non - essential gene discovering six genes affecting competence . Among those , three genes lead to low - competence ( SIN3 , SHE4 , ARC18 ) and three to high - competence pheno - type ( PDE2 , SPF1 , PMR1 ) , when deleted . Along with very low - competence mutants , several other low - transformability mutants were also detected : vrp1 , las17 , myo3 , myo5 , arp2 and arp3 ( Kawai et al . 2010 ) . All low - competence genes are involved in assembly and function of the Arp2p / 3p complex except SIN3 . Arp2p / 3p complex is indispensable for endocytotic internalization in yeast ( Robertson et al . 2009 ) . LAS17 component of Arp2p / 3p complex plays key role in actin polymerization and recruitment of F - actin dependent strong polymerization factors such as myosins ( MYO3 / 5 ) ; SHE4 and VRP1 chaperon the myosins and regulate their nucleation promoting activity , respectively , while ARC18 regulates actin motility and integrity . On the other hand , the genes form high - competence group are controlling cAMP level ( PDE2 ) , and Ca 2 ? or Ca 2 ? / Mn 2 ? metabolism ( SPF1 , PMR1 ) ( see http : / / www . yeastgenome . org / ) . It was suggested that the Arp2p / 3p activation machinery is critical for DNA internalization and that high level of cAMP can also contribute to competence through kinase A installing Tpk3p but not Tpk1p or Tpk2p ( Kawai et al . 2004 ) . This has emphasized the impor - tance of cytoskeletal dynamics and organization for the competence of yeast cells and suggested that DNA internalization during PEG / Heat shock - transforma - tion can also proceed through endocytosis or endo - cytosis - like process . Still it remains unclear whether such DNA internalization can be seen only as a endocytotic process since the competence was not affected by other relevant mutants important for actin cytoskeleton such sac6 , end3 , rvs161 , rvs167 , akr1 , erg2 , sla1 , kcs1 , and arg82 ( Kawai et al . 2004 ) . A possible solution to this dilemma would be to work on spheporasts and focus on PEG / Heat shock impact on the membrane addressing its role both in wt and selected typical endocytotic mutants . Nevertheless , more direct evidence that genes involved in vesicular transport ( regardless of whether endocytotic internal - ization is relevant or not ) are indeed responsible for yeast competence has come from Riechers et al . ( 2009 ) who reported speciﬁcally targeted research covering a representative subset of deletion mutants in endocytotic transport , endosomal / lysosomal acidiﬁ - cation and in intracellular transport of hydrolases during Neukamm’s method . This research revealed 11 genes contributing to yeast competence either posi - tively or rarely negatively . Among those , four genes are known to be involved in endocytotic transport ( RCY1 , VPS21 , VPS45 , VAM6 ) , four are controlling endocytotic / vacuolar pH - conditions ( STV1 , VPH1 , NHX1 , VCX1 ) and four have roles in autophagy and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) pathway ( VPS17 , APL5 , VAC8 , PEP4 ) . All of these , except RCY1 , showed slightly to considerably enhanced transformation efﬁciency compared to wt . Moreover , earlier study has shown that deletion of either YPT51 or YPT7 gene leads to increased transformation rate ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ) . Both genes are involved in endocytotic trans - port in yeast . Taken together , these data suggest that 1192 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 similar processes are important for yeast competence regardless of the utilized transformation method but , nevertheless , different genes are involved depending on the used vehicle . It is possible that relevant genes pinpointed by Kawai et al . represent only mutants impacting early / middle phase ( i . e . DNA adsorption and / or internalization ) rather than middle / later phase more dependent on steps leading to successful DNA survival within and / or release from endosomes which seems more relevant for Riechers’ and Neukamm’s approaches . Also , it is possible that genes showing impact during Neukamm’s method but not during PEG / Heat shock transformation had minor effects on transformation too but were not detected by the lower - efﬁciency method used by Kawai et al . Finally , it should not be neglected that the later two studies ware targeted rather that comprehensive ( as the former one ) excluding many possible relevant genes . Therefore , more speciﬁc investigations are needed to resolve this fundamental fussiness . For instance , all hitherto detected relevant genes in one approach need to be ascertained in the other too and vice versa . Further , Soltani et al . ( 2009 ) have also undertaken systematic transformation of circa 4 , 800 non - essential deletion mutants mediated by Agrobacterium conju - gation . This endevour winnowed four genes increas - ing ( GCN5 , NGG1 , YAF9 , EAF7 ) and three decreasing ( HST4 , HDA2 , HDA3 ) AMT efﬁciency . Former gene group is involved in histone acetyltransferase - and later in histone deacetylase - complexes suggesting that acetylation inhibits and deacetylation supports AMT in yeast . These genes are transcriptional regulators inﬂuencing the expression of other genes , so it is difﬁcult to say anything about their particular role in yeast competence . However , T - DNA integration is an essential part of AMT , so it is possible that the chromatin remodelers exert their effect on the level of chromatin directly , instead of via their target proteins . On the other hand Kawai et al . also detected SIN3 of the Sin3 - Rpd3 histone deacetylase - complex that has inﬂuenced yeast competence . The gene has a role in mating - type switching and meiosis and is involved in the maintenance of chromosomal integrity ( Wang et al . 1990 ) . This might speaks that acetylation / deacetylation here is relevant for ( re ) shaping the cell - surface which can play a role in yeast competence during the early phase . After identifying mutants affecting AMT Soltani et al . tested their impact on LiAc / SS - DNA / PEG transformability . Interestingly some genes impacted both AMT and LiAc - transformation , some only AMT and some had opposite effects on both . For instance , deletions of GCN5 , NGG1 , or HDA3 resulted in 2 - fold increased transformation efﬁciency , but instead of decreasing as in AMT experiment HDA3 increased LiAc - transformation efﬁciency , and YAF9 , EAF7 , or HST4 affected only AMT ( Soltani et al . 2009 ) . Altogether , these data suggest that AMT and LiAc - transformation share at least same collective charac - teristics or that particular step ( s ) are ubiquitous for all approaches leading to transformation . Few reports treat ambiguous genetic inﬂuence on yeast competence that cannot easily be attributed to a particular cell trait and / or process . Drastically com - promised or completely abolished competence was reported for glutathione - deﬁcient cells ( gsh1 : muta - tion in c - glutamylcysteine synthetase ) ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) . Thus in such mutants competence was lowered for even [ 200 - fold in average . Furthermore , yeast strains heterozygous for the mating type locus ( MATa / a genotype ) ( Durand et al . 1993 ) displayed elevated transformability . UV - pre - irradiated MATa / a cells showed 2 - fold increased competence compared to MATa / a cells . However , such increase was not seen in MATa / a cells exposed to visible light after UV irradiation . Moreover , the increase was not due to induced plasmid DNA repair , but rather a consequence of increased ability of pre - irradiated MATa / a cells for exogenous DNA uptake . Should this novel phenom - enon be attributed to affected interactions of the cell - surface and transforming DNA due to plausibly altered cell - wall in MATa / a genotype remains unclear . Nev - ertheless , it is worth repeating that another regulator of mating - type switching— SIN3 downregulates HO ( Wang et al . 1990 ) —also inﬂuenced yeast competence possibly through altered cell - surface . Finally , a recent study compared genome wide expression in cells growing either with or without PEG during Hayama’s stile transformation revealing many genes potentially important for competence ( Kawai et al . 2009 ) . Thus during transformation PEG is able to up - regulate 61 genes of known and 55 genes of unknown function and down - regulate 29 genes of known and 9 genes of unknown function ( for more details see Kawai et al . 2009 ) . Among the up - regulated genes of particular interest might be a vacuolar gene ( LAP4 ) , and genes involved in protein export pathway ( NCE103 ) and autophagy ( ATG8 ) . Moreover , amid Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1193 123 down - regulated genes there are even 13 with plausible roles in yeast competence . Those are involved in Mn 2 ? homeostasis ( ATX2 ; see Kawai et al . 2004 ) , bud forming ( SBE2 , AXL2 , MUB1 , YBR267W ; due to possible role in shaping the cell - surface ) , cAMP - signal pathway ( GIS4 ; see Kawai et al . 2004 ) , Golgi - ER transport vesicles ( YER113C ; due to its role in cellular adhesion ) . Furthermore , of interest might be also the four vacuolar genes ( YGR071C , YNR061C , YDR119W , TPO2 ) of which TPO2 is especially attractive for its role in polyamine transport since polyamine is known to stimulate plasmid DNA uptake ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ) . In Kawai’s work YGR071C was labeled as nuclear but later study claims to be vacuolar ( Ricarte et al . 2011 ) . Of yet further interest should be the down - regulated nuclear gene NSR1 , which codes for a nuclear localization sequence binding protein plausibly important for nuclear internalization . Non - genetic parameters Among the non - genetic factors I will discuss both biological and non - biological environmental proper - ties , starting with biological factors . Cell physiology is an important biological property that affects yeast competence ( Table 4 ) . Here , cell physiological parameters are cell - cycle phase , plating density and sugar metabolism . Growth phase strongly inﬂuences transformation efﬁciency depending on the approach . Biologically and chemically induced com - petence in yeast leads to best transformation efﬁciency when transforming exponentially growing cultures unlike physical approaches where nearly - resting or resting cells are best to transform . Thus for spheroplast ( Hinnen et al . 1978 ; Gerbaud et al . 1979 ) , LiAc ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ; Gietz et al . 1995 ) but also for PEG - solely and PEG / Heat shock procedures ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) early - to mid - logarithmic phase leads to best efﬁciency . However , late - exponential or mid - station - ary cells could be transformed by electroporation ( Grey and Brendel 1992 ) or biolistic approach ( Armaleo et al . 1990 ) , respectively . On the other hand , Neukamm’s method ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ; Riechers et al . 2009 , 2010 ) and mediated natural yeast competence ( Heinemann and Sprague 1989 ; Nishik - awa et al . 1990 ; Bundock et al . 1995 ; Piers et al . 1996 ; Nishikawa and Yoshida 1998 ; Fukumaru and Yoshida 2000 ; Hooykaas et al . 2006 ; Soltani et al . 2009 ) require cells in exponential growth unlike induced T a b l e 4 N on - g e n e ti c p a r a m e t e r s e n a b li ng b e s t c o m p e t e n ce i n S . ce r ev i s i a e P r op e r t y Y ea s t t r a n s f o r m a ti on N o t e A r ti ﬁ c i a l N a t u r a l N e uk a mm ’ s m e t hod B i o l og i ca l C h e m i ca l P hy s i ca l M e d i a t e d I ndu ce d B i o l og i ca l C e ll phy s i o l o gy C e ll - c y c l e p h a s e E a r l y t o m i d e xpon e n ti a l E a r l y t o m i d e xpon e n ti a l M i d - s t a ti on a r y t o l a t e e xpon e n ti a l E xpon e n ti a l S t a ti on a r y E xpon e n ti a l P l a ti ng d e n s it y L o w e r L o w e r L o w e r H i gh e r H i gh e r H i gh e r S ug a r m e t a b o li s m I m po r t a n t I m po r t a n t O t h e r p H N e u t r a l N e u t r a l * N e u t r a l A c i d i c N e u t r a l A c i d i c * S h i f t fr o m n e u t r a l t o e it h e r ac i d i c o r b a s i c p H e nh a n ce s e f ﬁ c i e n c y i n H a y a m a ’ s p r o t o c o l 1194 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 T a b l e 4 c on ti n u e d P r op e r t y Y ea s t t r a n s f o r m a ti on N o t e A r ti ﬁ c i a l N a t u r a l N e uk a mm ’ s m e t hod B i o l og i ca l C h e m i ca l P hy s i ca l M e d i a t e d I ndu ce d O s m o ti c p r e ss u r e I m po r t a n t R e l e v a n t R e l e v a n t * I m po r t a n t * * * B i o li s ti c * * E a r l y s t e p s : hyp e r t on i c ; L a t e r s t e p s : hypo t on i c N on - b i o l og i ca l P E G I n c r ea s e s e f ﬁ c i e n c y I n c r ea s e s e f ﬁ c i e n c y I n c r ea s e s e f ﬁ c i e n c y * * E l ec t r opo r a ti on C a ti on s M onov a l e n t N o t i m po r t a n t I m po r t a n t D i v a l e n t I m po r t a n t N o t i m po r t a n t * I n c r ea s e e l ec t r opo r a ti on e f ﬁ c i e n c y * I m po r t a n t i n m i s ce ll a n e ou s a pp r o ac h e s V a r i ou s c h e m i ca l s 2 - M E / t h i o l c o m pound s ; E t h a no l ; D M S O ; G l u t a t h i on e * ; G l y ce r o l a n d t r i ace ti n * * ; P r o t ea s e s ; B a s i c p r o t e i n s * * * I n c r ea s e e f ﬁ c i e n c y * P E G - on l y * * M i s ce ll a n e ou s a pp r o ac h e s * * * L i A c / P E G O m i ss i on o f T r i s / H C l D ec r ea s e s e f ﬁ c i e n c y T r ace s o f s o a p D ec r ea s e s e f ﬁ c i e n c y D ec r ea s e s e f ﬁ c i e n c y C h l o r oqu i n e ; C a ti on i c li p i d s a nd po l y ca ti on s I n c r ea s e e f ﬁ c i e n c y A ce t o s y r i ngo n e I nd i s p e n s a b l e * * A M T ( A . t u m e f a c i e n s ) H ea t s ho c k N o t r e qu i r e d I m po r t a n t P l a u s i b l y i nvo l v e d * * P hy s i o l og i ca ll y i ndu ce d n a t u r a l c o m p e t e n ce A M T A g r oba c t e r i u m - m e d i a t e d t r a n s f o r m a ti on , 2 - M E 2 - m e r ca p t o e t h a no l Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1195 123 natural competence ( Costanzo and Fox 1988 ; Nevoigt et al . 2000 ) where stationary cells give best results . Altogether , these data offer a view that exponentially growing cells are better for achieving mediated natural competence , biologically or chemically induced com - petence in yeast , and during Neukamm’s method . Contrary to that , resting cells better support induced natural competence and physically induced compe - tence in yeast . Nevertheless , few miscellaneous approaches leading to natural yeast competence utilized exponentially growing cultures ( Khan and Sen 1974 ; Broach et al . 1979 ) . Therefore , although it is obvious that cell - cycle establishes an essential impact on yeast competence its inﬂuence is ambiguous . However , one recent study has addressed this question more closely and systematically . The results show that transformation efﬁciency is highest at the S - phase of the cell - cycle ( Chaustova et al . 2008 ) . Plating density could also inﬂuence the transfor - mation efﬁciency ( for instance , it is known to affect biolistic transformation ; Armaleo et al . 1990 ) . Bio - logically , chemically and physically induced compe - tence utilizes lower plating density of up to 1 – 4 9 10 8 cell / ml ( Hinnen et al . 1978 ; Delorme 1989 ; Mani - vasakam and Schiestl 1993 ; Gietz et al . 1995 ) contrary to physiologically induced or mediated natural yeast competence ( AMT ) ( Piers et al . 1996 ; Nevoigt et al . 2000 ; Hooykaas et al . 2006 ) and Neukamm’s method ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ) where density between 1 and 1 . 5 9 10 9 cells / ml achieves best results . Hence , although during miscellaneous achievement of natural yeast competence lower plat - ing density was used ( 10 8 cell / ml ; Broach et al . 1979 ) , it seems that generally natural competence , unlike the artiﬁcial , is more prone to higher plating density . Sugar metabolism appears to be important for natural yeast competence . Non - growing yeast cells can take exogenous DNA under starvation conditions while metabolizing sugar in the absence of other nutrients ( Nevoigt et al . 2000 ) . Addition of complete or minimal media inhibits the natural transformability completely indicating that such process depends on the uptake and / or metabolism of the given sugar . Accordingly , no transformants were seen when a non - fermentable carbon source like sorbitol was used for incubation ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ) . Such competence by Neukamm’s method was developed utilizing yeast natural transformability and therefore this result nicely corroborates the resemblance of both approaches . However , although all this implies an important role of sugar metabolism in the process of exogenous DNA uptake in natural environment it is not entirely transparent why yeast is naturally prone to DNA uptake only when growing on sugars . One possible reason is the increased level of cAMP known to be involved in enhanced competence in yeast plausibly through altered call - wall properties ( Tomlin et al . 2000 ; Kawai et al . 2004 ; Vandamme et al . 2012 ) . Finally , pH and osmotic pressure impact both yeast competence and cell homeostasis . Except for Neu - kamm’s method and AMT , other approaches leading to competence either artiﬁcial or natural utilize neutral pH value during transformation ( Hinnen et al . 1978 ; Broach et al . 1979 ; Ito et al . 1983a , b ; Klebe et al . 1983 ; Costanzo and Fox 1988 ; Delorme 1989 ; Heine - mann and Sprague 1989 ; Schiestl and Gietz 1989 ; Armaleo et al . 1990 ; Nishikawa et al . 1990 ; Becker and Guarente 1991 ; Manivasakam and Schiestl 1993 ; Nevoigt et al . 2000 ) although shifting the pH from 7 . 0 to either 4 . 0 or 9 . 0 signiﬁcantly enhanced the trans - formation efﬁciency in Hayama’s protocol ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) . On the other hand , Neukamm’s method usually proceeds in acidic conditions ( pH 4 ) ( Neu - kamm et al . 2002 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ) similarly to AMT ( pH 5 . 5 ) ( Bundock et al . 1995 ; Hooykaas et al . 2006 ) . Accordingly , recently a correlation between non - wt endosomal and / or vacuolar acidiﬁcation and enhanced transformation efﬁciency was demonstrated ( Riechers et al . 2009 ) . Osmotic pressure is conven - tionally relevant for biological procedures due to sustaining stripped - cell survival ( Hinnen et al . 1978 ) but was also shown to be important during both chemically induced competence assisted by 2 - mercap - toethanol ( Brzobohaty´ and Kova´cˇ 1986 ) and biolistic ( Armaleo et al . 1990 ) where osmotically stabilized solutions probably ameliorated possible lethal effect or sustained damaged cells , respectively . However , osmotic pressure plays an even more crucial role for yeast competence in Neukamm’s method . There , sucrose is utilized as an osmolyte suggesting that endocytosis takes place in a hypertonic environment ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ) . On the contrary , the hypotonic shift is indispensable during later phase when DNA release from the endosome is expected to appear ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ) . Analyses on the non - biological environmental parameters revealed that yeast competence is mainly dependent on the properties of DNA and the presence 1196 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 of PEG and / or cations , but also could be inﬂuenced by various additional chemicals and certain proteins . All of these here are labeled as chemical environmental factors important for yeast competence . During trans - formation DNA is used as both , the transforming principle and non - transforming yet transformation - favoring carrier . Length of the transforming DNA does not seem limiting since both biological and chemical procedures are known to allow uptake of even a whole chromosome ( Goto et al . 1990 ) . On the other hand , concentration ( Khan and Sen 1974 ; Beggs 1978 ; Schiestl and Gietz 1989 ; Gietz et al . 1995 ) , conformation ( Singh et al . 1982 ; Burgers and Percival 1987 ; Schiestl and Gietz 1989 ; Delorme 1989 ; Man - ivasakam and Schiestl 1993 ; Gjuracˇic´ et al 1994 ; Gietz et al . 1995 ; Gjuracˇic´ and Zgaga 1996 ) , presence of a double - strand break ( DSB ) ( Orr - Weaver et al . 1983 ; Gjuracˇic´ et al 1994 ) , DSB position ( Gjuracˇic´ et al 1994 ) , UV - irradiation ( Gjuracˇic´ et al . 1994 ) , DNA - sequence divergency ( Gjuracˇic´ et al . 1994 ) , and its strand - speciﬁcity ( Yamamoto et al . 1992 ) inﬂuence the transformability strongly . However , more inter - esting ﬁnding is that yeast competence can also be affected by plasmid type . In average , YRp plasmids transformed different yeast strains 2 - fold more efﬁ - ciently compared to YEp plasmids ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) . Efﬁciency ﬂuctuations related to plasmid type were also reported by Kawai et al . ( 2004 ) where average competence was better with YEp than YCp plasmids , and during AMT ( Soltani et al . 2009 ) where integrative plasmids achieved higher efﬁciency com - pared to episomal plasmids . While these results are explainable by the need for transforming DNA to integrate into the genome during AMT , mentioned efﬁciency differences during PEG / Heat shock are more difﬁcult to comprehend . PEG alone can promote yeast competence ( Klebe et al . 1983 ; Hayama et al . 2002 ) but such process is highly dependent on the growth phase ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) . Use of PEG is common for both biological and chemical procedure and it is known to increase transformation efﬁciency during physical approach ( electroporation ) ( Manivasakam and Schiestl 1993 ) . The essential role of PEG is repetitively corroborated by many groups ( Klebe et al . 1983 ; Brzobohaty´ and Kova´cˇ 1986 ; Bruschi et al . 1987 ; Gietz et al . 1995 ; Zheng et al . 2005 ; Chen et al . 2008 ; Kawai et al . 2009 ; Pham et al . 2011a ) . Thus studying yeast transform - ability by ﬂuorescence has revealed existence of binding sites for DNA on the cell - surface and not less important a possibility for their saturation when excessive DNA is present ( Zheng et al . 2005 ) . PEG has been shown to improve the binding of DNA to the cell - surface and Li ? enhances that effect synergisti - cally ( Zheng et al . 2005 ) . Such essential role of PEG on DNA adsorption was shown also earlier when it was demonstrated that DNA uptake appears only after PEG removal ( Bruschi et al . 1987 ) . Better ability of DNA to adhere cell - surface in the presence of PEG applies for both carrier and transforming DNA rendering ss - rather that ds - carrier more prone to adsorption ( Gietz et al . 1995 ) . Recent transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and ﬂuorescence study showed ss - carrier DNA covering the entire cell - surface leading to better cell - wall porosity and also emphasized the cumulative effect of ss - carrier and Li ? in the presence of PEG ( Pham et al . 2011b ) . However , the microarray / metabolome analysis shows that PEG additionally induces an intracellular response during transformation since cells incubated without PEG show up - and down - regulation of many genes ( Kawai et al . 2009 ) . The pro - adsorption role of PEG applies for protoplasts as well , where nevertheless , no syner - gistic enhancement with Li ? was spotted indicating that the role of alkali metal cations constrains on the increase of cell - wall permeability leading to bigger exposure of DNA binding sites ( Brzobohaty´ and Kova´cˇ 1986 ; Zheng et al . 2005 ; Chen et al . 2008 ) . Uptake of DNA in yeast cell could be promoted by both monovalent ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ) and divalent cations ( Hinnen et al . 1978 ) . Intact yeast cell could be rendered into transformable state by treatment with cations such as Li ? , Na ? , K ? , Rb ? , and Cs ? ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ) . On the other hand , divalent cautions ( Ca 2 ? or Zn 2 ? ) , known to promote transformation of bacteria and plant protoplasts , are generally not effective for intact yeast cells ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ) unless removed prior to DNA addition ( Bruschi et al . 1987 ) . However , elusive possibility that divalent cations ( Ca 2 ? or Mg 2 ? ) might mitigate miscellaneous natural compe - tence still exists ( Khan and Sen 1974 ; Broach et al . 1979 ) and moreover Ca 2 ? ions were shown to enhance electroporation efﬁciency of intact cells frozen in sorbitol ( Suga and Hatakeyama 2003 ) . Various addi - tional chemicals and certain proteins could inﬂuence yeast competence as well . Thus yeast transformability could be enhanced by 2 - mercaptoethanol or other thiol compounds ( Ito et al . 1983b , 1984 ; Brzobohaty´ and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1197 123 Kova´cˇ 1986 ) , ethanol ( Lauermann 1991 ; Soni et al . 1993 ) , dimethylsulphoxide ( DMSO ) ( Hill et al . 1991 ; Soni et al . 1993 ; Gallego et al . 1993 ) , oxidized but not reduced form of glutathione ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) , glycerol and triacetin ( Keszenman - Pereyra and Hieda 1988 , 1989 ) , proteases ( Brzobohaty´ and Kova´cˇ 1986 ) , and basic proteins ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ) . Of those , particularly interesting is the inﬂuence of glutathione . Thus in glutathione - deﬁcient cells the average com - petence was respectively improved up to 100 - fold or even [ 10 3 - fold when reduced ( GSH ) or oxidized ( GSSG ) form of glutathione was added to the trans - formation mixture . However , in wt - cells this increase was much lower , only * 5 - fold for GSH and [ 7 - fold for GSSG ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , com - petence could be decreased by omission of Tris / HCl and presence of traces of soap ( Schiestl and Gietz 1989 ) . Also , competence in Neukamm’s method is known to be enhanced by the aid of lysosomotropic substances such as chloroquine ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ) and certain carriers such as cationic lipids and polycations ( Wattiaux et al . 2000 ) and AMT depends on induction chemicals like acetosyringone ( Bundock et al . 1995 ; Piers et al . 1996 ; Hooykaas et al . 2006 ; Soltani et al . 2009 ) . Transient temperature increase ( so - called heat shock ) during transformation of intact cells is the most important physical environmental factor inﬂu - encing yeast competence ( Bruschi et al . 1987 ; Schiestl and Gietz 1989 ; Gietz et al . 1995 ; Hayama et al . 2002 ) . However , while during such chemical approach the heat shock temperature of 42 (cid:3) C is usually enforced ( elevation of * 17 – 20 (cid:3) from ambient to heat shock temperature ) a miscellaneous natural competence was achieved on 37 (cid:3) C ( elevation of only * 12 – 15 (cid:3) ) ( Khan and Sen 1974 ) . On the other hand , transforma - tion of spheroplasts does not require such temperature shock to allow DNA uptake probably due to trans - forming stripped cell . Therefore , since wild yeasts are growing on lower temperature , it is plausible to suggest that random and / or occasional temperature elevation might lead to competence even in natural habituates . Such scenario might be especially realistic during brewing when yeast is vigorously growing leading to temperature elevation . Indeed , physiolog - ically induced natural competence in yeast happens when metabolizing sugars only . Other physical factors affecting yeast transformation are the applied voltage during electroporation ( Delorme 1989 ; Simon 1993 ; Neumann et al . 1996 ) , the microprojectile’s constitu - tion , size , concentration and amount during biolistic approach ( Armaleo et al . 1990 ) , and the presence of glass beads ( Costanzo and Fox 1988 ) . Also , trans - kingdom conjugation aided by either E . coli or A . tumefacines requires physical contact between these donors and the yeast cell as an acceptor . Pathways and mechanisms of yeast competence The proposed model of Kawai et al . ( 2010 ) of intact yeast cell transformation predicts that DNA initially becomes attached onto the cell - wall through the indispensable role of PEG . Such DNA passes through the cell - wall largely helped by both vehicles Li ? and heat shock but also by ss - carrier DNA and then enters into the cell via endocytotic process wrapped in a membrane sac . The destiny of these endosomes containing DNA is elusive since there exists a possibility to be digested . Therefore , the manner by which transforming DNA reaches the nucleus , its ﬁnal destination , remains a mystery . However , this saga - cious model was designed to elucidate artiﬁcial yeast competence mainly dependent on biological and / or chemical laboratory manipulations . Here , I have also comprehensively discussed important ﬁndings shed - ding light on natural yeast competence . Therefore , broader data consolidation might generate a platform for a more general / comprehensive model on yeast competence . Regardless of the vehicle leading to yeast compe - tence , the transforming DNA needs to pass at least four natural obstacles on its way to successful transforma - tion , ( i ) the cell - wall , ( ii ) the cell - membrane , ( iii ) the cell - cytoplasm , and ( iv ) the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 1 ) . The cell - wall is , perhaps , the most powerful obstacle to achieving transformation and hitherto knowledge implies that both the yeast genome and its environment ( either natural or artiﬁcial ) are the keys through it . To get internalized into the cell , transforming DNA must ﬁrst accomplish a closer contact with the cell - surface . This has became partic - ularly obvious when it was realized that only DNA adhered to the cell - wall ( Fig . 1B ) , but not in solution ( Fig . 1C ) , passes through it ( Pham et al . 2011a ) . Therefore , the cell - wall could be bridged by ( i ) direct cell - to - cell contact ( Fig . 1D ) , ( ii ) by physical and / or chemical damages producing cracks through it 1198 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 Fig . 1 Pathways and mechanisms of yeast competence ( Integral model ) . Arp2p / 3p activation machinery might be critical for DNA internalization ( Kawai et al . 2004 ) . When SPF1 or SIN3 is deleted competence is respectively either increased or decreased probably by enhancedDNAabsorbanceonthecell - surfaceorlackofphosphatidyl - ethanolamineinthemembrane . Ras / cAMPpathwayisalsoinvolvedin competenceplausiblybyincreasedlevelofcAMP ( Kawaietal . 2004 ) . Tpk3p installed on PKA increases competence contrary to Tpk1p or Tpk2p which decrease competence . Sugar metabolism also leads to elevated level of cAMP and Ras / cAMP pathway further appears to modulate cell - wall construction . Endocytosed DNA is either released intactfromtheendosomeordigestedupondeliverytothevacuole . Genes like RCY1 are involved in DNA release during early endocytotic steps ( Riechers et al . 2009 ) . Also , acidiﬁcation of endosomal / vacuolar compartments differing from wt slows down the transport of endocytosed DNA to the vacuole .

Thisdrawingisnotinscale Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1199 123 ( Fig . 1E , G , I ) , and ( iii ) by altering its adherence - ability and / or permeability ( Fig . 1F , H ) . All transfor - mation approaches either natural or artiﬁcial utilize one or more of these mechanisms . Thus during mediated natural yeast competence donor species ( E . coli or A . tumefacines ; Fig . 1A ) transfer ss - DNA ( protein - DNA complex ) via predeﬁned way probably through a hollow pilus established during the cell - to - cell contact that passes the wall and expectedly reaches the cell - membrane ( Fig . 1D 1 ) ( Kru¨ger and Stingl 2011 ) . On the other hand , physical damages can be achieved either biologically ( spheroplasts ) , where the cell - wall is simply punctured by enzymatic digestion ( Fig . 1G 4 ) , or physically ( electroporation or biolistic ) , where transforming DNA is either electrically forced or biolistically accelerated through ( Fig . 1I 11 , 12 ) . Moreover , weaker physical damage is also ecologically plausible and hence this mechanism is most probable for mechanically induced natural competence ( Fig . 1E 2 ) . However , most challenging to comprehend is the mechanism that accommodates the chemical and / or physical properties of the cell - wall in order to accept foreign DNA . To this mecha - nism ( s ) appertain most of other approaches either natural or artiﬁcial and its enforcement is based on the aid of certain genes ( Gallego et al . 1993 ; Durand et al . 1993 ; Tomlin et al . 2000 ; some bud - forming genes : Kawai et al . 2009 ; Pham et al . 2011a ) and environ - mental factors ( mostly PEG , cations , heat shock and carrier DNA ) known to inﬂuence yeast competence by altering cell - wall properties ( Fig . 1H 5 – 10 ) . Heat shock or carrier DNA are not sufﬁcient by themselves to cause competence—unlike PEG ( Klebe et al . 1983 ; Hayama et al . 2002 ) or cations ( Khan and Sen 1974 ; Broach et al . 1979 ) that were shown to assist miscellaneous natural competence ( Fig . 1H 9 , 10 ) . Moreover , synergy between those improves the cell - wall absorption - ability and / or permeability enabling DNA entrance more easily ( Zheng et al . 2005 ; Chen et al . 2008 ; Pham et al . 2011b ) . Indeed , recent endeavour achieved unique insight into the mecha - nism ( s ) of such synergy visualizing a protruded , loose , and porous cell - wall after treatment with ss - carrier DNA and Li ? ( Pham et al . 2011b ) . Thus TEM imaging suggested that the carrier can partially enter into the cell - wall by causing a structural change that can be synergistically enhanced by Li ? . This mechanism is further corroborated by earlier observations that transforming DNA can become DNase - resistant only after PEG removal ( Bruschi et al . 1987 ) emphasizing both the adsorption role of PEG and the wall - penetrating role of ss - carrier enhanced by Li ? and possibly by heat shock ( Pham’s experiment was conducted at 42 (cid:3) C ) . Finally , during physiologically induced natural competence call - wall properties are plausibly altered ( Tomlin et al . 2000 ; Kawai et al . 2004 ) as an outcome of elevated level of cAMP due to monosacharides / disaccharides metabolism ( Vandam - me et al . 2012 ) ( Fig . 1F 3 ) . This possibility also gives an idea on the probable way of DNA through the wall during Neukamm’s method where competent cells are sustained in a hypertonic solution of sucrose . Hence , Ras / cAMP - signal pathway might support competence through altered wall properties also during Neu - kamm’s style transformation . However , prior to sustaining the cells in sucrose , they are socked in hypotonic solution ( distilled water ) to make them competent by swelling ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ) . Such hypo - to hypertonic shift ( unknown during physiologically induced natural transformation ) might also affect the cell - wall prop - erties possibly leading to better DNA adherence and / or passage . The next natural barrier to be passed by the transforming DNA on its way to the nucleus is the cell - membrane . Once passed the cell - wall , the trans - forming DNA enters into the space between the wall and the membrane . DNA is not membrane - soluble and thus it cannot enter the cell without the aid of a vehicle . Moreover , its negative charge additionally repels it from the surface . Three mechanisms employed to pass the membrane could be abstracted depending on the approach . During mediated natural transformation ss - DNA is most probably transmitted through the pilus ( Kru¨ger and Stingl 2011 ) ( Fig . 1J 13 ) . However , in all other approaches DNA can bridge the membrane both by endocytosis / endocytosis - like process ( Fig . 1L ) and aided by transiently increased membrane permeability either through enhanced solubility or penetrating supposed short - lasting pores ( Fig . 1K ) . Compiled reports are offering comprehensive information on this . Here too , both the genome and its environment inﬂuence the process strongly . Since membrane invagination forming endosomes containing DNA is partially expected to be behind overcoming this natural obstacle , many genes could be involved . Indeed , hitherto reports show numerous genes respon - sible or involved in several cell processes such as actin 1200 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 cytoskeleton organization , endocytotic transport , cytokinesis , and membrane growth and polarity ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ; Kawai et al . 2004 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ) . However , while we can plausibly expect that during Neukamm’s style transformation DNA is indeed internalized by endocytotic machinery , this route may not be so obvious when the transformation is carried out mainly by PEG . Current belief is that endocytosis starts with actin dependent membrane invagination that slowly results in a vesicle that can be internalized through membrane scission together with its content ( Robertson et al . 2009 ) . Similar DNA engulfment is important in Kawai’s model due to observed low - competence phenotype in a subset of relevant endocytotic mutants ( see ‘‘Genetic parame - ters’’ section ) . Endocytosis or endocytosis - like pro - cess ( Kawai et al . 2004 , 2010 ) can be a part of DNA engulfment also during PEG - induced transformation based on increasing evidence showing endocytotic entrance of cationic lipid - or polymer - DNA complex ( lipoplexes or polyplexes , respectively ) into mamma - lian cells ( Elouahabi and Ruysschaert 2005 ; Khalil et al . 2006 ) . Transfection with lipoplexes / polyplexes is a non - viral way of introducing DNA into a cell therefore resembling transformation . Additional , although indirect , indication that DNA internalization during transformation indeed proceeds through such process comes from an experiment showing that negatively charged particles of Nanogold ( mimicking DNA ) —related with membrane structures—were located intracellularly ( Pham et al . 2011a ) . This suggests that DNA can also enter the cell along with the engulﬁng membrane structure . Other subset of relevant endocytotic mutants reviled no inﬂuence on competence , which brought a question why only a subset of typical endocytotic mutants show strong inﬂuence on yeast competence ? One possible expla - nation might be different tasks during endocytosis . Actin polymerization is initiated by Arp2p / 3p com - plex and regulated by numerous actin nucleation promoting factors . Absence of Las17p , Myo3p / 5p and / or Vrp1p can stop internalization by strongly inﬂuencing polymerization that impairs or even abol - ishes membrane invagination ( Galletta et al . 2008 ; Sun et al . 2006 ) . Thus , disability to engulf DNA might affect competence of las17 , myo3 / 5 , vrp1 mutants due to decreased possibility for DNA internalization . On the contrary , disability to detach or inwardly move the vesicle from the membrane might only barely affect competence of sac6 mutant . This can be due to lesser impact on DNA internalization which is already half - way internalized being trapped in the vesicle , or its latter release from the vesicle actuated by other mechanisms ( Riechers et al . 2009 ) . In the former scenario DNA does not get internalized and the competence drops , while in the latter case it is eventually internalized while the competence is barely affected . Therefore , one could contemplate that membrane invagination accomplished by actin poly - merization is important for DNA internalization during PEG - transformation which may be seen as endocytosis or endocytsis - like process ( Kawai et al . 2004 , 2010 ) . However , role of endocytotic invagina - tion during engulﬁng DNA may still remain elusive since competence was not affected by deletion of genes involved in vesicle scission such as SAC6 , RVS161 / 167 and AKR1 . This dilemma need to be resolved experimentally before more accurate model on yeast transformation is to be postulated . On the other hand , environment ( cations , PEG and versatile less utilized chemicals ) signiﬁcantly leverages the penetration plausibly by assuaging the repulse between the transforming DNA and the membrane . It was shown that PEG greatly alleviates DNA adherence to the stripped cells surface ( Chen et al . 2008 ) ( Fig . 1K 16 , L 16 ) . However , the synergy between PEG and monovalent cations , seen in intact cells , was completely absent in protoplasts ( Chen et al . 2008 ) suggesting that these ions do not inﬂuence the penetration through the membrane . On the contrary , divalent cations probably have role in allaying the membrane as obstacle to competence ( Khan and Sen 1974 Hinnen et al . 1978 ; Beggs 1978 ; Broach et al . 1979 ; Gerbaud et al . 1979 ; Hsiao and Carbon 1979 ; Struhl et al . 1979 ; Keszenman - Pereyra and Hieda 1988 ) ( Fig . 1K 16 , 17 , L 16 , 17 ) . Versatile chemicals are known to enhance competence and two categories can admissibly have role in passing the membrane , the lipid - soluble molecules , such as triacetin / glycerol ( Keszenman - Pereyra and Hieda 1988 ) ( Fig . 1K 17 , L 17 ) or cationic lipids ( Wattiaux et al . 2000 ) ( Fig . 1L 18 ) , and polycations ( Wattiaux et al . 2000 ) ( Fig . 1L 19 ) . Lipid - soluble molecules can plausibly enhance internalization by increasing DNA solubility in the membrane . However , it remains unknown weather cationic compounds can increase competence by similar process or simply by neutralizing DNA charge and thus facilitating engulfment by a Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1201 123 membrane invagination . Also , some osmolytes are known to enhance competence suggesting hyperto - nicity as natural environment for endocytosis ( Neu - kamm et al . 2002 ) ( Fig . 1L 20 ) although this could be an effect of improved DNA penetration through the cell - wall . Finally , like in the case of the cell - wall , here too physical approach depends on electrical ( Fig . 1K 14 ) or biolistic force ( Fig . 1K 15 ) to pass the membrane . Accordingly , an earlier partially theoret - ical study suggested that electrically - driven transfer of DNA across the cell - membrane is a sequence of interactive , electro - diffusive and passively diffusive events ( Neumann et al . 1996 ) . Therefore , such process should be looked upon as a purely artiﬁcial event not based on active engulfment aided by the membrane . Although it is believed that exogenous DNA exists into the cytosol folded in a membrane sac , the possibility that it dwells as unwrapped structure ( i . e . in free form ) cannot be entirely excluded . For instance , during both mediated natural transformation ( Kru¨ger and Stingl 2011 ) and physical artiﬁcial approach DNA enters and is expected to exist into the cell as such ( Fig . 1e , g ) . However , for all other approaches the former mechanism is more plausible ( Fig . 1a ) . Nev - ertheless , the latter scenario is also applicable if DNA internalization is aided by simple membrane penetra - tion ( Fig . 1h ) rather than by engulfment . During this phase , the imperative is to escape the destructive lytic power of the cell . Several genes and environmental factors are known to inﬂuence the exogenous DNA abidance into the cell . Thus genes involved in creating the endocytotic / vacuolar pH - conditions and autoph - agy and ALP sorting pathway are believed to inﬂuence the destiny of the internalized DNA ( Riechers et al . 2009 ) . Indeed , analyzing those processes in various deletants for appropriate genes ( see ‘‘Genetic param - eters’’ section ) Riechers et al . proposed that non - wt acidiﬁcation of the endosome slows down the trans - port of endocytosed DNA to the vacuole where degradation takes place ( Fig . 1j ) . Consequently , this leads to enhanced accumulation of DNA that is not being delivered to the vacuole . This might also nicely explain the positive effect of chloroquine that is known to be a lysosomotropic compound ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ) . These compounds are known to inhibit the transfer from endosomes to vacuole ( Mellman et al . 1986 ) . Moreover , altered pH additionally reduces the transport of hydrolases into endosome / vacuole also helping to protect the wrapped DNA from degradation ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ) . Accord - ingly , signiﬁcant pH shifting was reported as pro - competence factor during miscellaneous natural trans - formation ( Hayama et al . 2002 ) . However , endocyto - sed DNA plausibly needs to be released from the endosome in order to reach the nucleus ( Fig . 1b ) . Elusive possibility that DNA reaches the nucleus in a vesicle through membrane fusion ( Fig . 1d ) still exists as was predicted in the model of Kawai et al . ( 2010 ) . However , lowered competence in rcy1 deletants ( where early endocytotic steps are impaired ) was explained by less efﬁcient DNA liberation from the endosome ( Riechers et al . 2009 ) . Such possibility suggests important role of proper DNA release prior to reaching the nucleus . Therefore , hypotonic shift seems indispensable environmental factor for DNA release from the vesicles ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ; Riechers et al . 2009 ) and the possible mechanism may be the swelling and subsequent rupture of the vesicles due to sudden inﬂux of water ( Neukamm et al . 2002 ) . Transforming DNA that has entered into the cell passing its wall and membrane steel needs to penetrate the nucleus . That process is most poorly understood . On one side , as previously discussed , it is not entirely clear how endosomically packed DNA escape being delivered into the vacuoles and digested , and on the other , there also exists a question whether such DNA enters the nucleus through endosome / nuclear mem - brane fusion or gets relisted prior to penetration although both mechanisms are plausible . During physical approaches transforming DNA is most prob - ably physically forced into the nucleus either electri - cally ( Fig . 1i1 ) or biolistically ( Fig . 1i2 ) . Yet , most apparent mechanism should be the utilization of nuclear localization sequences ( NLS ) during AMT ( Fig . 1f ) . There , VirD2 / E2 - T - DNA - complex gets imported into the nucleus with the assistance of NLS while concomitantly being protected against lytic enzymes from the cytosol ( see Lacroix et al . 2006 ) . Indeed , one separate study brings evidence of unam - biguous and uniform nuclear localization of the pilot protein TraI ( bearing NLS ) in yeast ( Silby et al . 2007 ) . It is particularly interesting that this protein contains numerous basic amino acids evenly distributed which might be important for the actual import mechanism in other approaches since it is known that basic proteins facilitate transformation ( Ito et al . 1983a , b ) . On the other hand , how DNA gets internalized into the nucleus during E . coli – S . cerevisiae conjugation 1202 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 123 remains unclear since this system does not possess NLS due to its putative boundedness to prokaryotic world . Furthermore , it is also completely idiopathic how transforming DNA reaches the nucleus during other transformation approaches . Two routes of nuclear internalization have been offered for higher - cell transfection ( Elouahabi and Ruysschaert 2005 ) . First , exogenous DNA enters the nucleus during mitosis which represents very short period of the cell cycle when the inner and outer nuclear envelope is broken down . However , yeast nuclear envelope remains intact during the nuclear division , even though it is going through remodeling that is initiated by nucleus during sporulation ( Knop 2011 ; Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) . Within this period nuclear pores are being formed due to necessity of duplicating the spindle pole body and the nuclear pore complex that suggested more loosen membrane structure ( Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) . Highest competence can be at the S - phase of the cell - cycle ( Chaustova et al . 2008 ) where the continuous expansion on the nucleus plausibly follows envelope changes ( Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) . Interestingly , unlike resting cells , the exponentially growing cells are more efﬁciently transformed in approaches that do not rely on phys - ically induced competence , which is known to be less expected to follow physiological routes ( see ‘‘Non - genetic parameters’’ section ) . The second route emphasizes an active nuclear import . It is known that materials entering the nucleus are being selected by the nuclear pore complex . It is also believed that the maximal entry size threshold is constrained by the channel radius ( 4 . 5 nm ) of the pores which allows passage of protein of approximately 60 kD ( Dingwall and Laskey 1986 ) . Transforming DNA is usually signiﬁcantly larger . For instance , plasmid over 5 kbp is larger than 3 , 000 kD ( Tsuchiya et al . 1988 ) . Thus the problem of nuclear internalization seems utterly difﬁcult . However , an early study showed that isolated yeast nuclei have the ability to uptake exogenous DNA in vitro in the presence of ATP and Mg 2 ? ( Tsuchiya et al . 1988 ) suggesting active import ( Fig . 1c ) . More - over , such internalization was abolished by the action of both N , N’ - dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and quercetin which also inhibit nuclear ATPase and a protein kinase , respectively . Therefore , the involvement of these enzymes in the nuclear DNA transport was proposed ( Tsuchiya et al . 1988 ) . Also , it should be kept in mind that so far no cellular organelle was transformed other that biolistically ( Bonnefoy and Fox 2007 ) ( Fig . 1i3 ) . However , mitochondria and / or chlo - roplasts although enveloped by double membrane layers unlike the nucleus posses no pore system . Finally , the possibility that DNA reaches the nucleus through retrograde transport via Golgi was experi - mentally rejected by Kawai et al . ( 2004 ) ( Fig . 1k ) . Conclusions and open questions Existence of natural competence in yeast clearly shows that its laboratory transformation is not an entirely artiﬁcial process . On the other hand , natural transformability seems crucial for maintaining genetic variability in many bacterial species ( Bacillus , Strep - tococcus , and Haemophilus spp . ) ( Smith et al . 1981 ; Maynard Smith et al . 1991 ; Denamur et al . 2000 ; Kohiyama et al . 2003 ) . However , obvious lack of highly efﬁcient and genetically determined mecha - nism ( s ) of natural yeast competence renders its possible evolutionary impact in lower eukaryotes elusive since they relay mainly on meiosis . Neverthe - less , recent deeper genomic insights showing evidence of horizontal gene transfer substantially corroborated its evolutionary role in eukaryotes ( Fitzpatrick 2012 ) . Moreover , vehicles plausibly contributing to natural competence appeared to be comprehensive . Thus exogenous DNA could be passed into yeast cell in order to transform it by the aid of either biological mediation or environmental induction and the accom - panying mechanisms are versatile . On the other hand , such natural yeast competence dramatically improved under the assistance of laboratory manipulations has been substantially utilized and turned into a powerful technology of paramount application for both basic and applied research . During this endeavor we have managed to scrutinize many parameters both genetic ( genomic ) and non - genetic ( environmental ) affecting yeast competence . Even certain genes and / or entire cell processes responsible for the phenomenon of competence were abstracted . However , despite the initial knowledge many important questions , for instance concerning the evolution and genetics of natural yeast competence , still remain open rendering the subject covetous to more systematic and targeted approach . Nevertheless , acquired knowledge allows us to propose bold conclusion that yeast competence for exogenous DNA uptake is controlled by both its Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ( 2013 ) 103 : 1181 – 1207 1203 123 genome and the surrounding environment either natural ( ecological ) or artiﬁcial ( man - made ) . There - fore , yeast natural competence might be deﬁned as a quantitative genetic trait that bears the power to vary over real time and thus allows yeast to better adopt over evolutionary time . However , such reverie needs further proof by targeted research promising to attract novel generations of researchers .
