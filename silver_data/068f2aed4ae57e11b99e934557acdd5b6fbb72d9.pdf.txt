Our results for SW radiation are broadly consistent with these studies on a quasi - global scale , al - though we are somewhat biased toward the trop - ical regions because of the geometry inherent in ES measurements ( Fig . 1 ) . However , the albedo decrease of the proxy is two to three times larger than the satellite estimates , making it comparable to their estimated decrease in OLR ( 11 ) . The post - 1999 recovery we find is a novel result . The effect of clouds on Earth’s albedo is probably larger in visible light than in the ul - traviolet ( UV ) or near - IR . For UV radiation , strong Rayleigh scattering and ozone absorp - tion reduce the impact of clouds on the albedo . In the near - IR region , absorption by cloud par - ticles , water vapor , and carbon dioxide all limit the impact . Consequently , variations in broad - band SW albedo may be somewhat smaller than those in the visible albedo shown in Fig . 3 . If the changes in cloud properties responsi - ble for the reflectance changes shown by the proxy were a result of secularly increasing at - mospheric greenhouse gases , then they would signal a strong positive SW cloud feedback , although a simultaneous negative feedback may be expected through reduced cloud trapping of IR radiation ( 14 ) . However , the reflectance in - crease from 1999 to 2003 would be difficult to attribute to monotonically increasing atmo - spheric greenhouse gases . Natural variability is a much more plausible explanation , given the size and time scale of the proxy changes . We have used a combination of ES and satellite observations to deduce interannual and decadal variations in Earth’s large - scale reflec - tance . A decreasing reflectance since 1984 is derived from the ISCCP data , with a sharp drop during the 1990s . However , the ES data avail - able for subsequent years , with as yet no cor - responding ISCCP data , indicate that the trend has reversed since 1999 , with the decline being largely erased by the end of 2003 . These large variations in reflectance imply climatologically significant cloud - driven changes in Earth’s ra - diation budget , which is consistent with the large tropospheric warming that has occurred over the most recent decades . Moreover , if the observed reversal in Earth’s reflectance trend is sustained during the next few years , it might also play a very important role in future climate change . The ability of climate models to repro - duce changes such as these ( whether due to natural variability or anthropogenic forcing ) is therefore an important test of our ability to assess and predict climate change .

Weitz 1 , 2 * Networks of cross - linked and bundled actin ﬁlaments are ubiquitous in the cellular cytoskeleton , but their elasticity remains poorly understood . We show that these networks exhibit exceptional elastic behavior that reﬂects the mechanical prop - erties of individual ﬁlaments . There are two distinct regimes of elasticity , one reﬂecting bending of single ﬁlaments and a second reﬂecting stretching of entropic ﬂuctuations of ﬁlament length . The mechanical stiffness can vary by several de - cades with small changes in cross - link concentration , and can increase markedly upon application of external stress . We parameterize the full range of behavior in a state diagram and elucidate its origin with a robust model . Actin is a ubiquitous protein that plays a critical role in virtually all eukaryotic cells . It is a major constituent of the cytoskeletal network that is an essential mechanical component in a variety of cellular processes , including motility , mech - anoprotection , and division ( 1 , 2 ) . The mechan - ical properties , or elasticity , of these cyto - skeletal networks are intimately involved in determining how forces are generated and transmitted in living cells . In vitro , actin can polymerize to form long rigid filaments ( F - actin ) , with a diameter D (cid:2) 7 nm and contour lengths up to L (cid:2) 20 (cid:3) m ( 3 ) . Despite their rigidity , thermal effects nevertheless modify the dynamic configuration of actin filaments , lead - ing to bending fluctuations . The length scale where these fluctuations completely change the direction of the filament is the persistence length , (cid:1) p (cid:4) (cid:5) o / k B T (cid:2) 17 (cid:3) m , determined when the bending energy equals the thermal energy ; here , (cid:5) o is the bending modulus of the actin filament . Entangled solutions of F - actin are a well - studied model for semiflexible poly - mers ; they exhibit exceptionally large elasticity at small volume fractions as compared with more traditional flexible polymers at similar concentrations ( 4 – 6 ) . However , in vivo , the cytoskeletal network is regulated and controlled not only by the concentration of F - actin , but also by accessory proteins that bind to F - actin . Indeed , nature provides a host of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) with a wide range of functions : They can align actin filaments into bundles and they can cross - link filaments or bundles into networks ( 2 , 7 ) . However , unlike flexible poly - mers , where changes in cross - link density do not markedly affect the elasticity ( 8 ) , small changes in the concentration of cross - linker ABPs dramatically alter the elasticity of F - actin 1 Department of Physics , 2 Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA 02138 , USA . 3 Department of Mechanical Engineering , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , Cam - bridge , MA 02139 , USA . 4 Department of Biology and Division of Biological Engineering , Whitehead Insti - tute for Biomedical Research , MIT , Cambridge , MA 02142 , USA . 5 Division of Physics and Astronomy , Vrije Universiteit , Amsterdam , Netherlands . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

A quantitative under - standing of this behavior is essential to control and exploit biomimetic materials based on actin or other semiflexible polymer networks . It is also an essential first step in understanding the elasticity of cytoskeletal networks and the piv - otal role of ABPs in the mechanical behavior of the cell . However , very little is known about the microscopic mechanisms underlying the elas - ticity of semiflexible polymer networks and , in particular , the quantitative behavior of cross - linked and bundled F - actin networks . We study the elasticity of a model compos - ite network of bundled and cross - linked F - actin . We use an ABP that simultaneously bundles and cross - links actin filaments while being suf - ficiently rigid so as not to contribute to the network compliance . The elastic behavior of such in vitro networks exhibits marked varia - tion as the F - actin and cross - link densities are varied . For example , by changing the cross - link concentration alone , the network elastic modu - lus can be reliably and precisely tuned over more than three decades ( Fig . 1A ) ; this is in marked contrast to conventional flexible poly - mer materials , where the elasticity is rather insensitive to chemical cross - links ( 8 ) . In addi - tion , the network can exhibit considerable stiff - ening with applied stress , with the effective elasticity increasing by more than a decade with virtually no change in strain ; thus , the compli - ance nearly vanishes . By contrast , at lower con - centrations of either F - actin or cross - links , the nonlinear strain stiffening completely disap - pears , and the network elasticity can remain linear for strains as large as unity . Thus , there are two qualitatively distinct regimes of elastic - ity , highlighted by the different - colored regions of the state diagram in Fig . 1A . A robust model elucidates the fundamental mechanisms of the network elasticity in each regime and rationalizes both the linear and nonlinear behavior of the elas - ticity captured by the state diagram ( 12 – 14 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic and complex network , in which ABPs play a myriad of roles ( 2 , 7 ) . Most ABPs implicated in cross - linking or bundling the network are them - selves highly dynamic and compliant , making it extremely difficult to isolate the origins of elas - ticity of the F - actin network itself ( 5 , 9 , 10 , 15 ) . To overcome these difficulties , and define a benchmark for the elasticity of cross - linked ac - tin networks , we use scruin , which is found in the sperm cell of the horseshoe crab ( 16 ) . Scruin - calmodulin dimers decorate individual F - actin filaments , and nonspecific scruin - scruin interactions cross - link and bundle neighboring filaments ( 17 ) . In vivo , scruin mediates the formation of a single , crystalline bundle of 80 actin filaments ; this functions as a mechano - chemical spring in the acrosomal process ( 16 , 18 ) . In vitro , actin filaments polymerized in the presence of scruin are cross - linked and bundled by scruin - scruin contacts and form an isotropic , disordered three - dimensional network that is macroscopically homogeneous over a large range of cross - linking concentrations ( 19 ) . Scruin bonds are irreversible , and scruin itself is not compliant ; thus , the elasticity of our networks appears to be due entirely to the F - actin filaments . In the absence of scruin , an F - actin solution forms an isotropic and homogeneous mesh ; at a concentration of 11 . 9 (cid:3) M , the mean separation between filaments is (cid:1) 300 nm ( Fig . 1B ) . ( 20 ) . We tune the degree of filament cross - linking and bundling by varying the scruin concentra - tion , c S , for a fixed actin concentration , c A , such that the density of cross - links , R , is c S / c A and varies from 0 to 1 ; a pelleting assay confirms that the degree of polymerized actin remains constant for a given c A as R is varied ( 19 ) . The morphology of actin - scruin networks remains similar to that of an entangled F - actin solution with values of R up to 0 . 03 . For R (cid:6) 0 . 03 , we observe the formation of compact bundles ( Fig . 1C ) ; the bundle thickness increases even further as R is increased , as shown for R (cid:4) 0 . 5 in Fig . 1D . Using electron microscopy , we measure the average bundle diameter , D B , as a function of R ; for R (cid:6) 0 . 03 , D B varies approximately as D B (cid:2) R x , where x (cid:1) 0 . 3 ( 19 ) . For R (cid:4) 1 , the average bundle thickness is D B (cid:2) 50 nm , which leads to a significant increase in the rigidity of the actin bundles . The bending rigidity of any rod increases rapidly with its width , varying as D 4 ( 21 ) , and for scruin - mediated actin bundles , (cid:5) B (cid:1) (cid:5) o ( D B / D ) 4 , consistent with theory ( 17 ) . Thus , the average bundle stiffness increases to (cid:1) 600 (cid:5) o , greatly increasing the persistence length . We can also directly control the average distance between filaments , (cid:7) , by varying both R and c A ( 22 ) , (cid:7) (cid:2) D B / (cid:3) c A (cid:1) R x / (cid:3) c A ( 1 ) Thus , we can finely tune the net - work morphology . To measure the elasticity of these networks , we apply a force and measure the resultant deformation ; the elastic modulus , G (cid:8) , is defined as the ratio of the stress , (cid:9) , or force per unit area , to the strain , (cid:10) ; thus , G (cid:8) (cid:4) (cid:9) / (cid:10) . The networks can also have a viscous or dissipative response , and the resultant stress depends on the strain rate , (cid:10) ˙ , defining the loss modulus , G (cid:11) (cid:4) (cid:9) / (cid:10) ˙ . More generally , G (cid:8) ( (cid:12) ) and G (cid:11) ( (cid:12) ) depend on the frequency and are measured by applying a small oscillatory stress at a frequency , (cid:12) . In these cross - linked networks , the elastic modu - lus dominates the mechanical response , reach - ing a frequency - independent plateau , G o , at frequencies less than 1 Hz ( fig . S1 ) . The mag - nitude of G o is highly dependent on the mor - phology of the network ; for a small amount of cross - linking , the composite network is a soft elastic gel , and G o decreases weakly as R de - creases below 0 . 03 ( Fig . 2A ) . However , for R (cid:6) 0 . 03 , G o increases dramatically with R . Thus , the elasticity is strongly dependent on the scruin - mediated interactions that cross - link and bundle actin filaments , even at the same c A . The magnitude of G o is also highly depen - dent on actin concentration for a fixed value of R . For R (cid:4) 0 . 12 , we measure G o (cid:1) c A (cid:13) , where (cid:13) (cid:2) 2 . 5 as shown by the open triangles in Fig . Fig . 1 .

By varying either c A or R , the elastic modulus , G o , can be varied by more than three orders of mag - nitude , from less than 0 . 1 Pa to 300 Pa . For large values of c A or R ( indicat - ed by the red plane ) , the network elasticity be - comes nonlinear at very small deformations , and the elasticity becomes strain dependent and in - creases markedly upon in - creased strain . By contrast , at very low values of c A or R ( indicated by the blue plane ) , the network mechanical response remains linear up to large strains , and no strain stiffening is observed . Transitions between these two regimes of elasticity can be made by changing either R or c A , as indicated by the dashed lines .

We see similar scaling for all values of R , as shown in Fig . 2C for weakly cross - linked networks , R (cid:4) 0 . 03 ( squares ) , and thickly bundled networks , R (cid:4) 0 . 3 ( circles ) . Thus , the elastic modulus is also strongly dependent on the filament density . The elasticity of the networks can also ex - hibit a marked dependence on applied strain , (cid:10) . In the regime where G o increases rapidly with R ( Fig . 1A ) , the elastic modulus is linear below a critical strain , (cid:10) crit (cid:1) 10 % . However , above this strain , G o increases dramatically over a very small change in (cid:10) up to a maximum strain , (cid:10) max , whereupon the network breaks irrevers - ibly ( Fig . 2B , inset ) . This strain stiffening is completely reversible and the network can be cycled through strains up to (cid:10) max without any history dependence of the elastic response . These composite networks constitute an excep - tional material , whose modulus increases signifi - cantly with virtually no change in (cid:10) ; thus , they have a nearly vanishing compliance for (cid:10) (cid:6) (cid:10) crit . TheoriginoftheelasticityofentangledF - actin solutions is purely entropic , even though the fila - mentsaresemiflexible , witharatherlargebending rigidity ( 25 , 26 ) . Thus , the elasticity arises be - causeanappliedstrainreducestheaccessiblefluc - tuations ; this is an entropic elasticity , similar to that of flexible polymers such as rubber . Howev - er , when filaments are chemically cross - linked into networks such that the distance between cross - links , (cid:1) c , is less than (cid:1) p , or when the persis - tence length is increased as a result of bundling , it is unclear whether the network elasticity origi - nates from the actual bending of filaments , which is an enthalpic elasticity , or from stretching out thermal fluctuations of the filaments , which is an entropic elasticity ( 12 , 23 , 24 ) . To delineate the role of entropic effects in network elasticity , we model the network as a collection of thermally fluctuating , semiflex - ible filament segments of length , (cid:1) c , the av - erage distance between cross - links , such that (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:1) c (cid:14)(cid:14) (cid:1) p . Thermally driven transverse fluctuations reduce the end - to - end filament extension and lead to an entropic spring ; for small extensions , the force , F , required to extend this spring by length (cid:15) (cid:1) is F (cid:1) ( (cid:5) B2 / k B T (cid:1) c4 ) (cid:15) (cid:1) , where k B T is the thermal energy ( 12 ) ( fig . S2 ) ; this is the wormlike chain model that also describes the behavior of DNA ( 27 ) . Accounting for the concentration of chain segments through the mesh size , we can calculate the resultant stress ( 8 ) , (cid:9) (cid:4) F / (cid:7) 2 , and thereby determine the linear elastic modulus of the network by applying a strain , (cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:15) (cid:1) / (cid:1) c . We find ( 12 ) ( fig . S3 ) G o (cid:1) (cid:9) (cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:5) B2 k B T (cid:7) 2 (cid:1) c 3 ( 2 ) We assume that , for a fixed R , (cid:1) c is directly proportional to the distance between filament entanglements ( 12 , 28 ) ( fig . S3 ) . Thus , G o (cid:1) c A 11 / 5 , which depends strongly on actin concen - tration , consistent with that observed for both weakly cross - linked networks , R (cid:4) 0 . 03 , and for thickly bundled networks , R (cid:4) 0 . 3 . We conclude that the elastic stiffness of both weak - ly cross - linked and thickly bundled actin net - works is entropic in origin , originating from the stretching out of thermal fluctuations of indi - vidual actin filaments ( Fig . 3 ) . A critical test of this picture for the origin of the elasticity is the strain dependence ; when an entropic , semiflexible network is extended , thermally induced transverse fluctuations are pulled out . At sufficiently large extension , the response ceases to be linear , consistent with our observed strain stiffening above (cid:10) crit . Entropic , semiflexible networks break at an applied strain that is expected to decrease weakly with in - creasing filament concentration ( 12 ) ( fig . S3 ) ; this is also consistent with our observations , as shown in Fig . 2D . We can quantitatively test our model for the elasticity by determining the divergence of the stress response in the nonlin - ear elastic regime . Here , the force required to extend a single semiflexible filament , F (cid:1) 1 / ( (cid:1) c (cid:16) (cid:1) ) 2 , diverges dramatically as full exten - sion is approached , where (cid:1) 3 (cid:1) c ( 27 , 29 ) . However , the extreme nonlinearity of the mod - ulus makes precise oscillatory strain mea - surements virtually impossible , because the measured stress waveforms become highly nonsinusoidal . To overcome this limitation , we superpose a small oscillatory stress of magni - tude (cid:15)(cid:9) , for a constant applied stress , (cid:9) o , with (cid:15)(cid:9) / (cid:9) o (cid:14) 0 . 1 at 0 . 1 Hz , and determine the differential elastic modulus , K (cid:8) ( (cid:9) o ) (cid:4) [ (cid:15)(cid:9) / (cid:15)(cid:10) ]  (cid:9) o asafunctionof (cid:9) o . Thismeasurement applies a constant prestress while measuring the response to a small oscillatory stress , allowing us to accurately probe the divergence of the response as a function of applied prestress . When the elastic modulus is strain - independent , the differential modulus is the same as the elastic modulus , K (cid:8) ( (cid:9) o ) (cid:4) G o . However , above the critical stress , (cid:9) crit (cid:4) G o (cid:10) crit , K (cid:8) increases markedly until the network breaks , as shown for a large range of actin concentrations at fixed R in Fig . 4 . In this stress stiffening regime , K (cid:8) ( (cid:9) o ) (cid:1) (cid:9) o3 / 2 , consistent with that predicted for a single semiflexible polymer , dF / d (cid:1) (cid:1) F 3 / 2 ( 27 , 29 ) . The theoretical form of K (cid:8) ( (cid:9) o ) for these networks is predicted by using the full force - extension relation of a single actin filament and taking into account variations in (cid:1) c and c A , as well as spatial aver - aging of the orientation of chain segments ( 19 ) . By scaling the theory to fit the data for one concentration , c A (cid:4) 29 . 4 (cid:3) M and R (cid:4) 0 . 03 , we determine (cid:1) c and calibrate the absolute stress ; the theory is then in excellent accord with the remaining data sets , with no additional adjustable parameters , as shown by the curves in Fig . 4 . Moreover , the theory suggests that the functional form of the data should be the same for all values of c A and R . Consistentwiththisprediction , allthe data can by scaled onto a single master curve ( Fig . 4 , inset ) . This provides conclusive support for our hypothesis that the origin of both the linear and the nonlinear elasticity of the network is due to stretching of thermal fluctuations of single fil - Fig . 2 .

Thus , the elastic stiffening of the network results from the nonlinear force - extension behav - ior of individual filaments ; this further supports our hypothesis that the elasticity of cross - linked actin networks is entropic in origin . The origin of the network elasticity appears to remains entropic , even as (cid:5) increases as a result of bundling , or as (cid:1) c decreases as a result of increased cross - linking . We demonstrate this by tuning these two parameters simultaneously , by varying R while keeping c A fixed . The re - sultant networks exhibit variations in both G o and (cid:10) max with R that are consistent with our model ( fig . S3 ) . They also exhibit similar strain stiffening , and the qualitative form of the diver - gence of the incremental modulus remains un - changed .

Interestingly , two networks can have the same G o for different actin concentrations , provided that R varies ; how - ever , the onset of nonlinear behavior occurs at a different (cid:9) crit , as shown by the open circles in Fig . 4 . Thus , changes in the network morphology caused by variation in the filament cross - linking and bundle thickness dramatically affect both the linear and nonlinear elastic behavior . At very low values of c A or R , the qualita - tive features of the elastic response change dra - matically . This is most pronounced at very low values of R , where G o exhibits virtually no dependence on R ( Fig . 2A ) . Furthermore , these networks do not exhibit any strain stiffening but instead deform easily upon increased applied stress , and the elastic response remains linear for strains as large as (cid:10) (cid:1) 1 . This suggests that there is a second regime of elasticity with a qualitatively different origin . To capture the full variety of elastic behavior , we summarize all the data in the c A - R state diagram ( Fig . 5 ) . The elastic modulus varies continuously over four orders of magnitude as both c A and R are varied . We delineate the two distinct regimes with different symbols . In the first regime , for sufficiently large c A or R , G o is highly sensitive to both c A and R and exhibits pronounced strain stiffening ( denoted by the plus signs in Fig . 5 ) . The origin of the mechanical response is quan - titatively explained by our model of entropic elasticity , which reflects the stretching and compression of individual filaments . This mod - el implicitly assumes that the deformations of the network are affine , or distributed uniformly throughout the sample , and thus the strain is homogeneous at all length scales ( Fig . 3 ) . There is a sharp transition , denoted by the dashed line in Fig . 5 , to the second regime of elasticity , where G o is much less sensitive to both c A and R and exhibits no strain stiffening ( denoted by the open circles in Fig . 5 ) . This behavior is consistent with a model that suggests that the network deformation at lower filament or cross - link concentrations may be nonaffine ; the elas - tic connections of the network are sparse , and its response is dominated by bending of indi - Fig . 3 . Asummaryofthe interpretation of results presented in this paper . ( A ) Networks are poly - merized between two plates of area , A , and separation , h . By varying the ﬁlament or cross - link concentration , we vary the network micro - structure ; low ﬁlament and cross - link density areshownintheleftcar - toon , whereas high ﬁla - mentandcross - linkden - sity are shown in the right cartoon . ( B ) We measure the mechanical properties of the net - works by applying a force , F , per unit area , A , or stress and measuring the deformation or strain (cid:10) (cid:17) x / h . The microscopic distribution of the strain differs in the networks . Our data show two distinct mechanical regimes , distinguished by their nonlinear response . One of these is consistent with macroscopic mechanical properties due to enthalpic ﬁlament bending , as expected for low cross - link or ﬁlament density . This leads to a highly inhomogeneous distribution of strain , as indicated by the red arrows . By contrast , the mechanical properties of dense networks are consistent with stretching of thermally induced ﬁlament ﬂuctuations and an entropic elasticity . The resultant strain is uniform throughout the sample , as indicated by the red arrows . ( C ) The table summarizes the essential differences in the elasticity of entropic and enthalpic networks .

In this model , the linear mod - ulus is predicted to be G o (cid:1) c 2A ( 23 , 24 ) . Further - more , because network elasticity is determined by filament bending , which is rather small on the molecular scale , there is no mechanism for strain stiffening . Thus , as summarized in Fig . 5 , a net - work of rigidly cross - linked semiflexible poly - mers can exhibit a rich variety of elastic behaviors simply by varying the filament concentration , cross - link density , or bundle thickness . We speculate that there may also be a third regime of elasticity , in the limit of very high values of c A and R ; here , the response will again be affine but will be totally enthal - pic in nature , and the compliance will be dominated by the mechanical stretching and compression of filaments or bundles , with no universal mechanism for strain stiffening . Our results also have important implications for how a cell may regulate its mechanical response , with small variations in either fila - ment or cross - link concentration to make rap - id and precise transitions to qualitatively alter the mechanical strength of the cytoskeletal network . Furthermore , the mechanical prop - erties of the cytoskeletal actin network may also be varied as a function of external pre - stress , providing a potential mechanism for mechanosensing and mechanoprotection in the cell by allowing small variations in force to significantly increase its mechanical strength . Finally , our data highlight the im - portance of understanding single - molecule mechanics to interpret the mechanical prop - erties of networks . Because we can so pre - cisely parameterize the elastic behavior of cross - linked actin networks , it is now possi - ble to be quantitatively predictive for in vivo physiological conditions . Other physiological cross - linkers , unlike scruin , are neither rigid nor inextensible ; as a result , the single - molecule elasticity and dynamics of the cross - linker must also be included when modeling these more complex networks . However , our data using the rigid cross - linker scruin provide an essential benchmark for the elasticity of the cytoskeletal actin network . References and Notes 1 . H .

Using this system , we conducted hydrogenation reactions that proceeded smoothly to afford the desired products quantitatively within 2 minutes for a variety of substrates . The system could also be applied to deprotection reactions . We could achieve an effective interaction between hydrogen , substrates , and a palladium catalyst using extremely large interfacial areas and the short path required for molecular diffusion in the very narrow channel space . This concept could be extended to other multiphase reactions that use gas - phase reagents such as oxygen and carbon dioxide . Multiphase catalytic reactions play important roles not only in the research laboratory but also in the chemical and pharmaceutical in - dustries ( 1 ) . They are classified according to the phases involved , such as gas - liquid , gas - liquid - liquid , or gas - liquid - solid reactions . Although numerous multiphase catalytic re - actions are known and many are used in industry , these reactions are still difficult to conduct when compared to homogeneous re - actions , because the efficiency of interaction and mass transfer between different phases is extremely low , and thus in most cases the reaction rates are slow . In general , to accel - erate multiphase catalytic reactions , some treatment producing high interfacial area be - tween the two or three reacting phases , such as vigorous stirring or additional equipment , is needed , and the development of more ef - fective , simple devices that can produce such a high interfacial area between different phas - es is a much - sought - after goal . To achieve efficient multiphase catalytic reactions , we focused on a new device , which has a very small channel ( nanometer - to micrometer - sized in width and depth and centimeter - to meter - sized in length ) in a glass plate ( 2 – 10 ) . A similar device , the so - called “microchannel reactor , ” is used mainly in the field of analytical chemistry ( 11 ) . The device has a very large specific interfacial area per unit of volume . In concrete figures , this area rises to 10 , 000 (cid:1) 50 , 000 m 2 / m 3 , as opposed to only 100 m 2 / m 3 for conventional reactors used in chemical processes ( 12 ) .
