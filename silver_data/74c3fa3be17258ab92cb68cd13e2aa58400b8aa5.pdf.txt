Whereas some integrins , such as α 5 β 1 , interact with a lim - ited number of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ligands , others , such as α v β 3 and α 4 β 1 , have multiple ECM - binding partners . In addi - tion , the same ECM ligand can be engaged by different integrins 1 ( Fig . 1a ) and activate alternative signalling pathways . Thus , the bio - logical response to environmental cues is strongly influenced by which integrins are expressed and active on the plasma membrane . The extensive overlap in the signalling pathways of the mammalian integrin family complicates the interpretation of loss - of - function experiments . Invertebrate model organisms have greatly broad - ened our understanding of integrin - driven processes in vivo as these express a smaller repertoire of integrins and integrin ligands 2 ( Fig . 1a ) . Integrin function is regulated through multiple mecha - nisms , including conformational changes , protein – protein interac - tions and trafficking 3 – 7 . In most cell types , integrin function depends on a delicate balance between active and inactive receptors on the cell surface 8 , 9 , and spatiotemporal control of integrin activation is key for efficient adhesion formation and cell motility 10 . Integrins are activated through ‘inside - out’ signals : an intracellular signal that promotes the binding of proteins such as talin and kindlin to the β integrin tail that switches the receptor into an extended conforma - tion with high affinity for ECM ligands 11 . Integrin binding to ECM ligands , in turn , triggers ‘outside - in’ signals that recruit protein complexes ( Fig . 1b ) , consisting of scaffolding / adaptor molecules , kinases and phosphatases , to regulate cell behaviour . The network of proteins recruited to integrin adhesion sites 12 , 13 varies in com - position and size , giving rise to multiple classes of integrin – ECM adhesions ( Fig . 1c ) . Integrin adhesions are highly dynamic and undergo constant cycles of assembly and disassembly . The lifetime and composi - tion of focal adhesions ( described in Fig . 1c ) strongly influences ECM - driven signalling and therefore cell behaviour . Adhesion turnover is regulated , in part , by integrin endocytosis and exocy - tosis back to the cell surface , typically referred to as recycling 4 , 14 , 15 ( Fig . 2a ) . Endocytosed integrins are also able to transmit intracy - toplasmic ‘inside - in’ signals either through recruitment of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , and possibly other effectors 16 , 17 , or by enhancing the signalling of co - trafficking growth factor recep - tors 18 – 20 ( Fig . 1b ) . Thus , knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and the molec - ular specificity of integrin trafficking pathways is fundamental in understanding integrin function . In this Review , we discuss recent insights into how integrins traffic and how integrin trafficking path - ways regulate cellular processes , including animal development . Integrin endocytic trafficking pathways Unlike many other cell - surface receptors that undergo synchro - nized ligand - induced internalization and degradation , integrins are constantly trafficked in cells . The Rab family of small GTPases are implicated in each step of this process 4 , 14 , 21 ( Fig . 2a ) . Integrins are initially endocytosed by different mechanisms ( Fig . 2b ) and routed to Rab5 - positive early endosomes where sorting decisions are made . A large proportion of integrins are recycled back to the plasma membrane through two distinct pathways ( reviewed in refs 4 , 14 ) . As a result , integrins are remarkably stable with a half - life of 12 – 24 hours 22 – 24 . The constant flux of integrins between the plasma mem - brane and intracellular pools allows cells to probe the environment for adhesive and migratory cues and to adapt their mechanical and morphological properties to mount appropriate responses . Clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent endocytosis of integrins . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the best - stud - ied integrin internalization route 14 , 25 . Over 50 proteins identified as key components of the CME machinery coordinate membrane invagination , the formation of clathrin - coated pits , cargo recruit - ment and vesicle scission 26 ( Fig . 2b ) . In polarized cells , ECM proxi - mal integrins at the cell front are endocytosed via interaction with the clathrin adaptor Numb , the recruitment of which is inhibited by phosphorylation mediated by the apical polarity determinants Par3 – atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) 27 . In mature disassembling focal adhesions , kinesin KIF15 , a microtubule motor protein , pro - motes the recruitment of the clathrin adaptor disabled homologue 2 ( Dab2 ) to integrins to trigger CME and FAK - dependent and dynamin - dependent vesicle scission 28 – 30 . Following focal adhesion disassembly , endocytosed , ligand - unbound integrins can be main - tained in an active state by talin and FAK within endosomes . This integrin pool transits from Rab5 - positive early endosomes to Rab11 recycling endosomes and is recycled to the cell front for polarized adhesion assembly and directional fibroblast cell migration 17 . Rab5 - dependent and FAK - dependent integrin endocytosis is also associ - ated with ultrasound therapy - induced cell migration 31 , suggesting that this pathway may be a more general mechanism for regulating cell migration . FAK also plays a role in clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) of integrins . Galectin - 3 , an extracellular carbohydrate - binding lec - tin , induces the formation of clathrin - independent carriers and internalization of receptors , including β 1 integrins , by recruiting intracellular GTPase regulator associated with FAK ( GRAF1 ; also known as ARHGAP26 ) in complex with phosphorylated FAK to the receptors 32 , 33 . Other routes of integrin CIE include internaliza - tion from caveolae 34 – 37 , rapid macropinocytosis of unengaged inte - grins from the dorsal cell surface following platelet - derived growth Integrin trafficking in cells and tissues Paulina Moreno - Layseca 1 , 3 , Jaroslav Icha 1 , 3 , Hellyeh Hamidi 1 , 3 and Johanna Ivaska 1 , 2 * Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is fundamental to metazoan multicellularity and is accomplished primarily through the integrin family of cell - surface receptors . Integrins are internalized and enter the endocytic – exocytic pathway before being recy - cled back to the plasma membrane . The trafficking of this extensive protein family is regulated in multiple context - dependent ways to modulate integrin function in the cell . Here , we discuss recent advances in understanding the mechanisms and cellular roles of integrin endocytic trafficking .

Integrins are internalized into Rab5 - positive early endosomes ( EEs ) . These mature into late endosomes ( LEs ) , which fuse with lysosomes ( Lys ) for integrin degradation . Under certain conditions , integrins exit LE – Lys compartments and are recycled back to the plasma membrane 24 . Integrins also traffic to multivesicular bodies ( highlighted by * ) and to the perinuclear recycling compartment ( PNRC ) . This process occurs within 20 minutes , whereas degradation takes several hours 124 , resulting in the majority of integrins being recycled back to the cell surface .

Recently , accumulation of an LL5 ( pleck - strin homology like domain , family B ) – liprin - α 1 – ERC1 ( ELKS / Rab6 - interacting / CAST family member 1 ) ternary complex at the cell periphery was associated with focal adhesion turnover through vinculin and paxillin displacement and active integrin internal - ization into endosomes 40 . Whereas ERC1 was shown to partially colocalize with caveolin , a definitive role for caveolae was not investigated here 41 . These internalization pathways underscore the importance of precise and spatially controlled integrin uptake . However , they fail to explain how cells choose a particular endocytic pathway and / or discriminate between different integrin heterodimers or integrin activation states . Fine - tuning integrin endocytosis . The majority of integrin recep - tors share a common β 1 subunit ( Fig . 1a ) with a conserved β - tail NPxY / NxxY motif that enables interaction with CME adaptors and endocytosis accessory proteins , such as epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 8 ( EPS8 ) , Dab2 and Numb 42 . Hence , all β 1 - containing heterodimers can potentially be endocytosed via the same mechanism . However , it is becoming apparent that different molecular path - ways are employed to distinguish between integrin heterodimers , activation states and trafficking routes to regulate specific biological processes ( Table 1 ) . For example , in endothelial cells , internalization of active β 1 integrin from nascent adhesions into Rab5 endosomes , requiring R - Ras and Rin2 , leads to Rac activation , lamellipodia for - mation and directional cell motility 43 . Conversely , selective traffick - ing of inactive β 1 integrins , containing the α 1 , α 2 and α 3 , but not α V or α 5 , chains , from the dorsal plasma membrane to the ventral side by a Dab2 – EPS15 CME module may be important for maintaining the reservoir of intracellular integrins during HeLa cell migration 44 , 45 . How these two pro - migratory pathways are consolidated in cells remains unknown and , perhaps , each requires a distinct extracel - lular cue and / or is cell - type specific . Although many adaptors have been associated with β 1 integrin endocytosis , a few have also been attributed to the trafficking of other β - subunits . In oral squamous carcinoma cells , the cytoskeletal regulator HCLS1 - associated protein X - 1 ( HAX - 1 ) interacts with α V β 6 integrin and induces its internalization via clathrin to pro - mote cancer cell migration and invasion 46 . Integrin - heterodimer - specific internalization can also be regulated by integrin α - subunits that harbour a common endocytosis motif ( Yxx ϕ ) recognized by clathrin adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) 47 . This conserved motif permits selective CME of integrins , containing the motif , over other recep - tors that lack it , but bind to the same ECM ligand . This could allow heterodimer - specific downstream signalling to initiate divergent responses to an ECM ligand . Whereas the role for clathrin and / or its adaptors in integrin endo - cytosis is undisputed , there is some debate as to the precise condi - tions required for CME of integrins . A recent study highlighted a low - force microenvironment as a prerequisite for Dab2 recruitment to active β 3 integrins 48 . Whether other clathrin adaptors are influ - enced by force is not known . Regardless , the cell clearly employs different mechanisms for selective CME of integrin heterodimers , which may depend on extracellular cues , including ECM topology . Integrin interaction with other cell - surface receptors , such as MET , syndecan - 4 and disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain - containing protein 9 ( ADAM9 ) , also influences endosomal traf - fic and cell adhesion and migration in vitro and in vivo 18 , 19 , 34 , 49 – 51 ( Fig . 2c ) . In addition , PKC - α activation , in response to an extracellu - lar cue , leads to phosphorylation of formin - like protein 2 ( FMNL2 ) , an actin nucleator / assembly factor , and FMNL2 - dependent integrin endocytosis ( Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , N - glycosylation of the α 5 inte - grin β - propeller favours integrin association with syndecan - 4 and subsequent receptor internalization 52 . Thus , interactions and signals at the cell surface can be vital for driving integrin endocytosis . Rab GTPases also provide selectivity for integrin traffic . Rab21 , Rab25 and Rab34 directly interact with integrins . The ubiqui - tously expressed Rab21 binds to α - subunit tails to induce integrin endocytosis , regulate focal adhesion turnover 39 and deliver active β 1 integrin to FAK - positive signalling endosomes for suppression of anoikis and survival of disseminated cancer cells 16 . By contrast , epithelial - cell - specific Rab25 interacts with the β - subunit tail to recycle endocytosed α 5 β 1 integrin locally within invasive protru - sions in three - dimensional ( 3D ) ECM 53 . In metastatic ovarian carci - noma cells , Rab25 - dependent sorting of α 5 β 1 integrin , endocytosed from the cell front , to lysosomes and exocytosis at the cell rear facil - itates rear detachment by activating Src - mediated focal adhesion disassembly 24 . Rab34 , a Golgi - associated protein , is upregulated in aggressive breast cancers and directly binds to the cytoplasmic tail of β 3 integrin . Epidermal growth factor stimulation recruits Rab34 to the plasma membrane and promotes Src - mediated tyro - sine phosphorylation of Rab34 , which induces β 3 integrin internal - ization and delivery to recycling compartments 54 . This protects β 3 integrin from degradation and stimulates cancer cell migration and invasion 54 . By contrast , Rab35 seems to limit α 5 β 1 integrin traffic as its inactivation by chloride intracellular channel protein 4 ( CLIC4 ) enhances α 5 β 1 integrin endocytosis and ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) - mediated recycling 55 . Concordantly , low Rab35 or elevated Arf6 expression enhances cell migration in some cancers 56 , placing Rab35 as a potential obstacle in cancer progression . Receptor internalization and subsequent transit to the Golgi , a process known as retrograde traffic , also seems to impart selec - tivity to integrin - dependent processes , depending on the acces - sory proteins involved . For example , a Golgi – SNARE ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide – sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ) complex , consisting of syntaxin - 6 and vesicle - associated mem - brane protein 3 ( VAMP3 ) , promotes integrin - heterodimer - specific recycling in different cell types . In HeLa and prostate cancer cells , this complex drives α 3 β 1 integrin - mediated chemotactic cell migra - tion 57 , whereas in endothelial cells , syntaxin - 6 is important for α 5 β 1 integrin - mediated cell spreading and motility on fibronectin 58 . Interestingly , another SNARE complex consisting of syntaxin - 16 is specific for the retrograde transport of inactive β 1 integrins 59 . Thus , retrograde transport may be a broad mechanism for the trafficking of β 1 integrin - containing heterodimers , and the ECM landscape and the composition of the SNARE complex determine the heterodimer and / or the specific receptor activation state that is a cargo for retro - grade transport . Sorting of integrins between late and recycling endosomes . Endocytic cargo can be recycled or shuttled through late endo - somes to lysosomes for degradation . However , integrins have the potential to bypass this protein downregulation machinery , which explains their generally low degradation rate mentioned above . An important regulator of endocytosed β 1 integrin fate is sorting nexin 17 ( SNX17 ) , which binds to the membrane distal β integrin NxxY motif , and in cooperation with the retriever and WASH ( WASP and SCAR homologue ) complexes , diverts the receptor from deg - radation to recycling 60 – 62 ( Fig . 2d ) . This process depends on proper endosomal localization of SNX17 ( ref . 63 ) and is fundamental for efficient cell adhesion and migration 63 . Alternative integrin recycling routes are regulated by specific endocytic adaptor proteins , such as DCC - interacting protein 13 - α ( APPL1 ) , GGA2 and the CORVET ( class C core vacuole / endosome tethering ) complex 64 – 67 ( Fig . 2d ) . APPL1 inhibits internalization of α 5 β 1 integrin and simultaneously promotes its recycling back to adhesion sites , resulting in increased cell - surface α 5 β 1 integrin and reduced adhesion dynamics 64 . However , the role of APPL1 may be dependent on cell type , as in lung cancer cells , APPL1 depletion FOCUS | REVIEW ARTICLE https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41556 - 018 - 0223 - z FOCUS | REVIEW ARTICLE NATURE CELL BIOLOGY NATURE CELL BIOLOGY | VOL 21 | FEBRUARY 2019 | 122 – 132 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 125 REVIEW ARTICLE | FOCUS NATURE CELL BIOLOGY has no effect on internalization or endosomal signalling of integ - rins 16 . Another possible link between APPL1 and integrin traffic is the CORVET complex , which mediates fusion of APPL1 - containing early endosomes 66 . Furthermore , the CORVET subunits Vps3 and Vps8 localize to Rab4 - positive and Rab11 - positive recycling endosomes in HeLa cells and participate in integrin recycling . Correspondingly , Vps3 / Vps8 knockdown inhibits cell adhesion , spreading and migration on fibronectin and collagen 67 ( Fig . 2d ) . Similar to internalization , intracellular sorting of integrins is fine - tuned by other receptors and ECM ligands and this process impinges on efficient cell migration 14 , 20 .

Association of inactive β 1 integrins with ADAM9 metalloproteinase is required for optimal β 1 integrin internalization , degradation and cell migration 49 . In fibroblasts , interaction between fibronectin and its receptor α 5 β 1 integrin promotes α 5 β 1 integrin ubiquitination and routing towards lysosomal trafficking and degradation . This is sug - gested to limit intracellular accumulation of integrins destined for re - adhesion and therefore allow more productive cell migration 22 . However , in cancer cells , it is the diversion of the α 5 β 1 integrin recep - tor away from degradation towards recycling , in a process requir - ing WASH ( Arp2 / 3 activator ) , that drives invasive cell migration 68 . Thus , although it is clear that other cell - surface receptors and ECM cues actively participate in the regulation of integrin fate , the choice between integrin recycling and degradation , particularly during cell migration , seems to be context dependent . Altogether , these examples illustrate the complexity of integrin traffic and highlight the need to tightly control these events to mod - ulate integrin - mediated functions in the organism . Integrin traffic in developing tissues Expanding evidence links integrin trafficking to the normal execu - tion of cellular processes , such as cell adhesion 4 , 15 , migration 14 , 20 , 69 , matrix remodelling 70 – 72 and differentiation 73 , 74 . The concept that these pathways can be hijacked by cancer cells has been reviewed elsewhere 4 , 75 – 77 . Below , we highlight the role of integrin trafficking pathways in regulating cellular processes that are fundamental for metazoan development and tissue homeostasis 2 , 78 . Integrin trafficking determines cell polarity and drives ECM remodelling . In polarized cell types , such as epithelial and endo - thelial cells , integrins control the orientation of the apicobasal axis by providing physical and mechanical cues ( ECM engagement ) and spatial positioning , and regulate molecular delivery to correct sub - cellular locations 79 – 81 . A striking example is the peri - implantation stage of mouse embryos ( embryonic day 5 ) , in which the epiblast undergoes apicobasal polarization and changes in cell morphology , leading to the formation of an epithelial rosette structure with a central cavity 82 , 83 . Interestingly , this polarization can be also reca - pitulated in stem cell colonies grown in Matrigel 82 . This process depends on ECM secreted by extraembryonic cell lineages and on selective , Rab6 - dependent and syntaxin - 16 - dependent , inactive β 1 integrin retrograde traffic 59 ( Fig . 3a ) . In the fish retinal neuroepi - thelium , regulated integrin – ECM interaction at the basal side of cells is required for bending this flat cell layer into a hemispheri - cal optic cup . Here , the amount of integrin at the basal endfeet is regulated by direct competition between β 1 integrin and the mem - brane protein Ojoplano ( Opo ) for binding to CME adaptors 84 . Loss of Opo triggers excess integrin endocytosis and failure in optic cup bending 85 ( Fig . 3b ) . In endothelial cells , the removal of ‘old’ fibronectin and the basolateral secretion of new fibronectin molecules are coupled to the cycle of Rab21 - dependent α 5 β 1 integrin recycling 70 . Fibronectin turnover is critical for fibronectin fibrillogenesis and vascular devel - opment 71 , 86 . Non - canonical interactions between angiopoietin - 2 , a regulator of vascular homeostasis , and α 5 β 1 integrin , leading to integrin activation , affect fibronectin fibrillogenesis , in addition to destabilizing endothelial cell – cell junctions 87 . Angiopoietin - 2 induces α 5 β 1 integrin transition from peripheral focal adhesions to stable fibrillar adhesions ( primary sites of fibronectin fibrillogen - esis ; Fig . 1b ) that are positive for tensin - 1 . In this study , the role of integrin traffic was not directly addressed ; however , increased α 5 β 1 integrin recycling into tensin - 1 - positive adhesions has been linked to endothelial destabilization in sepsis 88 . Thus , dynamic intracellu - lar movement of integrins and the generation of fibrillar adhesions are important for both vascular development and maintenance of vascular homeostasis . Links between metabolism and integrin trafficking . A cell’s met - abolic state is intimately associated with integrin traffic and matrix remodelling 72 . In high - nutrient conditions , tensin expression is suppressed by the cellular metabolic sensor 5 ′ AMP - activated pro - tein kinase ( AMPK ) 89 . By contrast , nutrient depletion induces α Box 1 | New tools to study integrin trafficking Lattice light sheet microscopy Integrin trafficking is a dynamic process and therefore best studied by live fluorescence microscopy techniques . Fast - moving endocytic vesicles need to be captured at high spatiotemporal resolution while avoiding illumination - induced phototoxicity on the living sample 135 , 136 . Lattice light sheet microscopy fulfils these criteria , as the new iteration of the method uses adaptive optics to correct for sample - induced image distortions and allows capture of intracellular events in a cell within intact tissues 137 , 138 . Measurements of the lifetime of endocytic events and vesicle trajectories within human stem cell - derived organoids and zebrafish embryos have demonstrated the power of this technique 137 . Lattice light sheet microscopy also enables imaging of fluorescently tagged endogenous proteins without the need for overexpression . 3D models Studying integrins in physiologically relevant 3D model systems may reveal biological events that are not observed on stiff 2D substrates . For example , growing cells in soft 3D collagen matrices have unravelled clathrin tubular lattices as mediators of integrin - based cell adhesion during cell migration 139 . Integrin tags Ectodomain labelling of β 1 , β 3 and α L integrins , which preserves receptor functionality , has been achieved 23 , 102 , 140 . Besides creating fusions with fluorescent proteins , ectodomain tagging also enables other applications . For example , the cell - surface population of β 1 integrin has been selectively tagged by a cell non - permeable Halo - tag ligand , which allowed the kinetics of β 1 integrin endocytosis to be measured 23 . In addition , pH probes based on red fluorescent SNAP - tag ligands 141 could be used to capture endocytosis and exocytosis , taking advantage of endosome acidification in comparison to the extracellular space . Synchronized endocytosis Unlike other membrane receptors , integrin endocytosis cannot be easily synchronized by the addition of ligand , because ECM ligands are constantly present in cell culture conditions . Synchronized CME of integrins could be achieved by adapting the inducible system of recruiting clathrin - binding protein fragments to specific membrane proteins 142 , for instance , to allow local optogenetic activation of integrin endocytosis with subcellular precision to steer cellular behaviour . In summary , by combining these methods , it is possible to capture integrin behaviour at the cytoplasmic membrane and in endosomes with improved spatiotemporal precision and to probe them in diverse experimental contexts .

In cancer - associated fibroblasts , interactions between Src - phosphorylated Hic - 5 ( also known as TGB1I1 ) , β 1 integrin and tensin - 1 stabilize β 1 integrin on the cell surface , preventing recep - tor internalization to lysosomes 91 . In starved human mammary epithelial cells , enhanced β 4 integrin expression and endocytosis expedite laminin uptake and degradation in lysosome - associated membrane glycoprotein 1 - positive vesicles to generate the nutri - ents required for mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activation and cell survival 92 . Notably , in the mammary glands of dietary - restricted mice , resident mammary fibroblasts are the primary source of laminin production , and fibroblast - condi - tioned medium supports survival of starved mammary epithelial cells 92 . An intriguing question is how metabolic stress creates both matrix - devouring ( epithelial cells ) and matrix - producing ( fibro - blasts ) entities within the same tissue 93 . Integrin traffic regulates cell adhesion in development . Drosophila models have provided important insights into the devel - opmental roles of integrin traffic in vivo . Surprisingly , in apparently very stable structures , such as the myotendinous junctions ( MTJs ) ( Fig . 3c ) , integrins are dynamically turned over by clathrin - medi - ated and Rab5 - mediated endocytosis 94 . Although the dynamics of this process somewhat decreases as development proceeds , it is comparable to the reported values for integrin turnover in fibrillar adhesions in vitro 94 . Integrin dynamics in MTJs depends on mus - cle tension and integrin activation state . Increased tension reduces integrin endocytosis , whereas loss in tension promotes both endo - cytosis and exocytosis 95 . In addition , whereas integrin inactivating mutations or reduced ECM levels trigger increased integrin turn - over , integrin activation decreases integrin turnover 96 . It remains unknown whether tension increases integrin activity and whether muscle tension and integrin activation converge on the same path - way to regulate integrin dynamics . Similar to other trafficking events 97 , integrin recycling in MTJs depends on phosphoinositide turnover in vesicle membranes . In Drosophila , loss of the lipid phosphatase myotubularin , which cleaves the early endosome lipid phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns3P ) , causes the accumulation of the β 1 integrin orthologue β PS integrin ( Fig . 1a ) inside cells in large abnormal PtdIns3P - positive endosomal compartments and leads to myofibre detachment from the cuticle 98 . Symptoms of myotubularin deficiency can be allevi - ated by simultaneous depletion of the class II phosphatidylinosi - tol - 3 - OH kinase Pi3K68D 98 . These observations can be explained by the need for PtdIns3P cleavage before an endosomal cargo can undergo exocyst - mediated exocytosis 99 ( Fig . 3c ) . Myotubularin loss in Drosophila manifests only in late pupal stages and resembles the condition of myotubularin mutation in humans , X - linked myotu - bular myopathy , in which β 1 integrin is mislocalized to the perinu - clear compartment 98 . Myotubularin loss also causes wing blistering , in line with the requirement for integrin – ECM adhesion and inte - grin trafficking for Drosophila wing morphogenesis 100 , 101 ( Fig . 3d ) . In summary , integrin turnover occurs even in stable adhesive struc - tures and allows for flexible response to changing conditions , such as fluctuating muscle tension . The dynamic nature of adhesions is not surprising given that , based on single - molecule tracking , inte - grin – ligand binding events do not exceed ~ 80 seconds in human epithelial cells in vitro 102 . This flexible system might constitute a conserved homeostatic mechanism , and the routes taken by integ - rins at different developmental stages might be tightly regulated to exert specific functions as required . Integrin trafficking impinges on cell migration in develop - ment . During metazoan development , cells actively migrate either individually or collectively . Integrin recycling is necessary for the migration of many cell types , including distal tip cells ( Fig . 3a ) , cranial neural crest cells ( NCCs ) ( Fig . 3e ) , neuronal growth cones ( Fig . 3f ) and immune cells ( the latter reviewed in refs 14 , 20 , 103 ) . In NCCs , integ - rin receptors for fibronectin and laminin are recycled through Rab4 and Rab11 pathways ( Fig . 3e ) and inhibition of integrin recycling impedes NCC migration in vitro 104 . Integrin trafficking is crucial also for collective cell migration or morphogenetic movements of cell sheets . During Xenopus gastrulation , the protein XGIPC1 ( also known as kermit2 ) promotes Rab21 - mediated α 5 β 1 integrin endocy - tosis and fibronectin ECM assembly by directly binding to the cyto - plasmic domain of α 5 integrin 105 . Loss of XGIPC1 function disrupts fibronectin ECM in embryos and causes defects indicative of slower mesoderm cell migration 105 . Whereas integrins are required for normal morphogenesis of the central nervous system 106 , 107 , integrin trafficking is dispens - able for the glial - guided radial migration of neurons , a dominant migratory mode in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum . Instead , the tissue - layering defects caused by integrin perturbation reflect the requirement for integrin - mediated adhesion and signalling earlier in development and for radial glia attachment to the ECM 108 , 109 . However , active integrin recycling plays a major role later in neu - ronal development 110 . Axonal growth cones use the Rab - coupling protein - dependent integrin recycling pathway , also employed by invasive cancer cells for effective migration 14 , 111 . In nerve growth factor - differentiated PC12 cells and in dorsal root ganglion neu - rons , α 9 β 1 integrin is trafficked through the Rab - coupling protein , Rab11 and Arf6 recycling endosomes 112 , 113 ( Fig . 3f ) , and perturb - ing this pathway reduces integrin cell - surface levels , resulting in inhibited axonal growth 113 . The use of particular recycling path - ways seems to be neuron - type specific . Retinal ganglion cell axonal growth cones in Xenopus embryos require Rab4 and Rab5 , but not Rab11 , presumably for local integrin recycling within the growth cone to support migration 114 . Development of the axon initial seg - ment in mature neurons precludes integrins and Rabs from entering the axon and axon regeneration 115 , 116 . Integrin traffic also influences dendrite morphogenesis . In hippocampal neurons , Ndr2 kinase phosphorylates the β 1 integrin cytoplasmic domain and stimulates Rab5 - dependent and Rab11 - dependent trafficking to increase active integrin at the cell surface , triggering premature dendritic branch - ing 117 . Thus , whereas adhesion and ligand availability are important regulators of cell morphology and positioning within a developing tissue , integrin trafficking coordinates an integral mechanism for delivering integrins and effectors to drive the formation of highly organized tissues and may be an important factor in the regulation of stem cell niches . Future perspectives Our knowledge of integrin trafficking pathways is rapidly expand - ing . However , how cells choose a specific internalization route ( or routes ) for different integrins is unclear . An important aspect is the composition of the plasma membrane surrounding integ - rins and the impact of the physical properties derived from lipid composition , membrane tension and curvature . The formation of nanoclusters of active and inactive integrins in the same focal adhe - sion and the different kinetics at which specific heterodimers are internalized may also be key in understanding pathway specific - ity 118 , 119 , but more work is needed to clarify these aspects of integrin behaviour . Whereas the precise spatial details of integrin redelivery to the cell surface remain to be elucidated , exocytosis of integrins 23 and other cargo 120 seems to preferentially occur at focal adhesions . Whether these hotspots of integrin exocytosis depend on integrin activation state , cellular signalling or ECM substrate are the next exciting questions . Furthermore , understanding why certain Rabs mediate the transport of specific integrins requires further investi - gation . Many of these questions may be answered by new imaging FOCUS | REVIEW ARTICLE https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41556 - 018 - 0223 - z FOCUS | REVIEW ARTICLE NATURE CELL BIOLOGY NATURE CELL BIOLOGY | VOL 21 | FEBRUARY 2019 | 122 – 132 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 129 REVIEW ARTICLE | FOCUS NATURE CELL BIOLOGY probes for integrins and super - resolution microscopy within more relevant in vivo models ( Box 1 ) . Furthermore , integrin reconstitu - tion on artificial liposomes 121 , 122 may help in understanding the role of membrane composition on the recruitment of specific endocytic adaptors and to identify core complexes that are needed to direct heterodimer - specific traffic . Understanding integrin endocytosis is also of clinical importance . This route is being exploited as a mecha - nism for cytotoxic drug uptake in the development of anticancer therapies 123 . Finally , it is critical to not only understand how integrin traffic occurs at the cellular level but also how this complex process gives rise to distinct biological functions in tissues .
