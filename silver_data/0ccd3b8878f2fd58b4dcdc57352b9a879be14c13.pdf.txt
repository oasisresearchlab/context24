INTRODUCTION 1 . 1 Motivation In a wireless sensor network , sensor nodes collect and send data to sink nodes , which may either be the users of the data , or gateways to another ( possibly wired ) network through which a remote user can access the data . Sensor nodes per - form a sensing function as well as a routing and forwarding function to move data to sink nodes . Since sensor nodes are battery powered , conserving and making eﬃcient use of en - ergy is an important consideration for all network protocols . In particular , forwarding packets depletes battery power at all nodes on a routing path , a problem that is made worse if sink nodes are poorly positioned , resulting in longer path lengths to sink nodes . Similarly , much of the traﬃc in a wireless mesh network passes through gateway nodes that provide connectivity to exterior networks such as the Inter - net [ 1 ] . To optimize bandwidth usage , it is important to minimize the path length between nodes and gateways [ 1 ] . This motivates the problem of optimal sink placement in a wireless sensor network or gateway placement in a wireless mesh network . In this paper , we model these problems as a facility location problem , in which network nodes corre - spond to clients , and gateways or sink nodes correspond to facilities . A wireless network is often modelled by a unit disc graph ( e . g . , [ 4 , 11 , 12 , 16 , 17 ] ) where the nodes are repre - sented by points on the plane and a node u is connected to every node located in the unit disc centred at u . Given a set of points P in the plane , we consider the problem of ﬁnding a set F of k points in the plane that minimizes the maximum graph distance between any point in P and the nearest point in F in the unit disc graph induced by P ∪ F . Although this problem is similar to the Euclidean k - centre and ver - tex k - centre problems ( see Section 3 ) , this version of the problem incorporates both geometric and graph - theoretic constraints , resulting in a new problem which we call the geometric k - centre problem . In the geometric k - centre problem , facilities may be se - lected from anywhere in the plane ( as in the Euclidean k - centre problem ) whereas the distance between clients and facilities is measured by graph distance ( as in the vertex k - centre problem ) . Thus the geometric k - centre problem is neither set solely in the host metric space nor on a graph . Given this new dual setting , existing solutions to the k - centre problem on graphs or in Euclidean space do not nec - essarily provide solutions to the geometric k - centre problem . 1 . 2 Overview of Results We show that the vertex 1 - centre provides a 5 - approximation of the geometric 1 - centre ; this bound is tight . We describe polynomial - time algorithms for ﬁnding exact and approxi - mate geometric 1 - centres of a unit disc graph . Our technique generalizes to ﬁnding a geometric k - centre for any ﬁxed k . When k is an arbitrary input parameter , we show that the geometric k - centre problem is NP - hard on unit disc graphs . 2 . DEFINITIONS Given a continuous metric space S , let d S ( p , q ) denote the metric distance between points p and q in S . Given a graph G = ( V , E ) , let d G ( u , v ) denote the unweighted graph distance between vertices u and v in V . Region R i ⊆ S is a ball of radius ρ if there is a central point c ∈ R i such that R i = { p | p ∈ S and d S ( c , p ) ≤ ρ } . Let ∂ ( R i ) denote the boundary of region R i in S and let int ( R i ) denote its interior . We say a set of regions R = { R 1 , . . . , R n } is uniform if there exists a ρ ≥ 0 such that every R i ∈ R is a ball of radius ρ in S . Examples of uniform sets of regions include a set of unit intervals in R under any ‘ p metric , a set of unit discs in R 2 under the ‘ 2 metric , and a set of unit cubes in R 3 under the ‘ ∞ metric . In this paper we consider the geometric k - centre prob - lem on intersection graphs of uniform discs . We remind the reader of the deﬁnition of an intersection graph : Definition 1 ( Intersection Graph ) . Given a set of regions R = { R 1 , . . . , R n } in S , the intersection graph in - duced by R has vertex set R and edge set { ( R i , R j ) | R i ∩ R j 6 = ∅ } . Next we deﬁne a geometric k - centre on an intersection graph : Definition 2 ( Geometric k - Centre ) . Given a set of regions R = { R 1 , . . . , R n } in a metric space S , a positive integer k , and a non - negative real number ρ , a geometric k - centre of R is a set of regions F = { F 1 , . . . , F k } in S , such that each F i ∈ F is a ball of radius at most ρ and F minimizes the eccentricity of F in R , denoted ecc G ( R , F ) , where ecc G ( R , F ) = max R i ∈ R min F j ∈ F d G ( R i , F j ) , ( 1 ) and G denotes the intersection graph of R ∪ F . For a given R , we refer to the minimum value of ( 1 ) as the geometric k - radius of R . In the facility location literature , R typically represents a set of clients ( the input deﬁning a problem instance ) and F represents a set of facilities ( a solution to the problem instance ) ; we use these terms to diﬀerentiate between regions in R and regions in F . The geometric k - centre problem is closely related to the vertex k - centre problem : Definition 3 ( Vertex k - Centre ) . Given a graph G = ( V , E ) and a positive integer k , a vertex k - centre of G is a set of vertices F = { v 1 , . . . , v k } ⊆ V that minimizes max u ∈ V min v j ∈ F d G ( u , v j ) . ( 2 ) We refer to the value of ( 2 ) as the vertex k - radius of G . A vertex k - centre is often called simply a k - centre ; we add the preﬁx “vertex” to distinguish it from a geometric k - centre . The vertex k - centre problem has been studied extensively ( see Section 3 ) . Although the geometric k - centre problem can be applied to several classes of intersection graphs , we primarily focus on graphs commonly used to model the topology of wireless networks : unit disc graphs . Given a point p ∈ R 2 , let Disc r ( p ) denote the disc of radius r centred at p . Similarly , given a set of points P ⊆ R 2 , let Disc r ( P ) denote the corresponding set of discs . When r = 1 we omit the subscript r . Definition 4 ( Unit Disc Graph ) . Given a set of points P in R 2 under the ‘ 2 metric , the unit disc graph induced by P , denoted UDG ( P ) , is an embedded graph with vertex set P and edge set { ( u , v ) | d S ( u , v ) ≤ 1 } . That is , vertices p and q in P are adjacent in UDG ( P ) if and only if q ∈ Disc ( p ) . See the example in Figure 1 . Equiva - lently , vertices p and q in P are adjacent in UDG ( P ) if and only if Disc 1 / 2 ( p ) ∩ Disc 1 / 2 ( q ) 6 = ∅ . Thus , a unit disc graph is an intersection graph . With respect to our discussion of geometric k - centres on unit disc graphs , we ﬁx ρ = 1 / 2 and identify the location of a client or facility by the point p at the centre of the corresponding disc . If P ⊆ Z 2 , then UDG ( P ) is a grid graph . A unit disc graph is not necessarily planar and its maximum degree can be as large as | P | − 1 . A grid graph , on the other hand , is planar and has maximum degree at most four . Naturally , the deﬁnition of a unit disc graph generalizes to three or higher dimensions as a unit ball graph and to one dimension as a unit interval graph , both of which can be considered with respect to the geometric k - centre problem . The arrangement induced by a set of regions R in S , de - noted A R , is a set of cells , each of which is a maximal con - nected region such that A R forms a partition of S and for all C ∈ A R and all R i ∈ R , int ( C ) ∩ ∂ ( R i ) = ∅ . When S = R 2 , we deﬁne the arrangement graph of R as the planar multigraph G = ( V , E ) whose vertex set V corresponds to points at which the boundaries of three or more cells inter - sect and whose edge set E corresponds to the simple curves in ∪ C ∈A R ∂ ( C ) \ V . The edges of the dual of the arrange - ment graph can be directed such that ( C a , C b ) ∈ E if and only if for every p ∈ P , C a ∈ Disc ( p ) ⇒ C b ∈ Disc ( p ) . See Figures 2A and 2B . Given a graph G = ( V , E ) , we employ standard graph - theoretic notation , where for each vertex v ∈ V , Adj ( v ) = { u | ( u , v ) ∈ E } denotes the set of vertices adjacent to v , deg ( v ) = | Adj ( v ) | denotes its degree , and N ( v ) = Adj ( v ) ∪ { v } denotes its neighbourhood . 3 . RELATED WORK 3 . 1 Vertex k - Centre Given a graph G = ( V , E ) , Hakimi and Kariv [ 13 ] give an algorithm to ﬁnd a vertex 1 - centre in O ( mn + n 2 log n ) time , where n = | V | and m = | E | . A vertex 1 - centre k = 1 k = 3 Figure 1 : ( Left ) A set of points P , the corresponding set Disc ( P ) , and UDG ( P ) . ( Middle ) The point at the centre of the shaded unit disc is a geometric 1 - centre of P . The corresponding graph UDG ( P ∪ F ) is illustrated . ( Right ) The set of points at the centres of the three shaded unit discs is a geometric 3 - centre of P . The corresponding graph UDG ( P ∪ F ) is illustrated . can also be found by calculating the unweighted all - pairs shortest path distances and identifying the vertex for which the maximum distance is minimized ; as shown by Chan [ 7 ] , this can be done in O ( mn / log n ) time if m > log 2 n , O ( mn log log n / log n ) time if m > n log log n , and O ( n 2 log 2 log n / log n ) time if m ≤ n log log n . When k is ﬁxed , a vertex k - centre can be found in O ( m k n k log n ) time [ 21 ] . When k is an input parameter , the problem is NP - hard [ 13 ] . 3 . 2 Unit Disc Graphs Clark et al . [ 9 ] give hardness results for several problems on unit disc graphs , including the minimum dominating set problem ( which we use as the basis for our hardness reduc - tion in Section 4 . 5 ) . They mention an earlier result by Ma - suyama et al . [ 19 ] regarding hardness of the vertex k - centre problem on unit disc graphs . Marathe et al . [ 18 ] describe ap - proximation algorithms for NP - hard problems on unit disc graphs , including a 5 - approximation for the minimum dom - inating set problem . They observe that any independent set in the neighbourhood of a vertex v has cardinality at most ﬁve . Given P ⊆ R 2 , Breu [ 5 ] describes an O ( m + n log n ) - time algorithm for constructing UDG ( P ) and an O ( n log n ) - time algorithm for enumerating the connected components of UDG ( P ) . Breu and Kirkpatrick [ 6 ] show it is NP - hard to decide whether a graph is a unit disc graph . That is , given only the combinatorial description for a UDG it is NP - hard to ﬁnd a unit disc embedding in the plane . This result is extended by Kuhn et al . [ 15 ] who show that it is NP - hard to approximate within a factor of 1 / √ 2 . The diﬃculty in ﬁnding a geometric k - centre of a unit disc graph arises from the geometric constraints implied by an embedding ; given only a combinatorial description for a graph , the addition of a universal vertex trivially solves the problem . As such , we assume knowledge of the graph’s planar embedding in a problem instance . 3 . 3 Geometric Sink / Relay Placement Similar to the geometric k - centre problem in which k is ﬁxed and the objective is to minimize the geometric k - radius , Mihandoust and Narayanan [ 20 ] consider the related h - hop covering set problem on a unit disc graph , in which the max - imum k - radius is ﬁxed and the objective is to minimize k . They provide PTASs for several variations of this problem . Aoun et al . [ 1 ] follow a similar approach for gateway place - ment in wireless mesh networks . Efrat et al . [ 10 ] consider the related relay placement problem , in which the objective is to add the minimum number of facilities ( relays ) such that the resulting network is connected . They consider a more general model in which the range of communication of relays and network nodes may diﬀer . 4 . FINDING A GEOMETRIC K - CENTRE OF A UNIT DISC GRAPH We begin by examining properties of arrangements of unit discs . We then establish bounds on the ratio of the geomet - ric 1 - radius to the vertex 1 - radius . We describe polynomial - time algorithms for ﬁnding exact and approximate solutions to the geometric 1 - centre problem on unit disc graphs and discuss how to generalize the solution for any ﬁxed k . Fi - nally , we show that the problem is NP - hard when k is an arbitrary input parameter . Throughout Section 4 , P de - notes an arbitrary set of points in R 2 , R = Disc ( P ) , A R denotes the arrangement induced by Disc ( P ) , n = | P | , and m denotes the number of edges in UDG ( P ) . 4 . 1 The Arrangement of a Set of Discs Deﬁnition 4 and the deﬁnition of an arrangement imply the following observation : Observation 1 . Given a set P ⊆ R 2 and points f 1 and f 2 in the same cell of the arrangement of Disc ( P ) , ecc UDG ( P ∪ { f 1 } ) ( P , { f 1 } ) = ecc UDG ( P ∪ { f 2 } ) ( P , { f 2 } ) . Therefore , if point f 1 is a geometric 1 - centre of P , then any point in the same cell as f 1 is also a geometric 1 - centre of P . Consequently , to identify a geometric 1 - centre of P it suﬃces to consider one point from every cell in A R . C b C a B A C Figure 2 : A . The edges of the dual of the arrangement graph can be directed such that ( C a , C b ) ∈ E if and only if for every p ∈ P , C a ∈ Disc ( p ) ⇒ C b ∈ Disc ( p ) . B . The arrangement induced by these four unit discs partitions the plane into twenty cells . The partial order of the corresponding dual graph has four sources and two sinks . To select locations for a facility , it suﬃces to consider the sinks , which correspond to convex cells ( shaded ) . C . This example due to T´oth [ 22 ] shows an arrangement induced by n unit discs that has Ω ( n 2 ) convex cells . By Propositions 2 and 3 , the number of cells ( and the number of convex cells ) in any arrangement of discs in the plane is Θ ( n 2 ) in the worst case ; this value is directly pro - portional to the run times of algorithms we describe in Sec - tions 4 . 3 and 4 . 4 . Proposition 2 ( Konhauser et al . 1996 [ 14 ] ) . An ar - rangement of n discs in R 2 contains at most n 2 − n + 2 cells . This bound is tight . The geometric dual of the arrangement graph of A R is a planar graph G = ( V , E ) whose vertex set is A R and whose edges connect adjacent cells in A R . The edges of G can be directed such that ( C a , C b ) ∈ E if and only if for every p ∈ P , C a ∈ Disc ( p ) ⇒ C b ∈ Disc ( p ) . Since any facility located within it will be disconnected from UDG ( P ) , we omit any face not contained in a unit disc ( e . g . , the exterior face ) from V . See Figures 2A and 2B . Observe that G is a partial order relation . Furthermore , for any cells { C a , C b } ⊆ A R and any points f a ∈ C a and f b ∈ C b , if ( C a , C b ) ∈ E , then UDG ( P ∪ { f a } ) is a subgraph of UDG ( P ∪ { f b } ) . That is , ecc UDG ( P ∪ { f b } ) ( P , f b ) ≤ ecc UDG ( P ∪ { f a } ) ( P , f a ) . Consequently , when selecting a position for a 1 - centre , it suf - ﬁces to consider only cells in A R that are sinks with respect to the partial order induced by A R . The sinks correspond exactly to the convex cells in A R . One might hope that the number of sinks is asymptotically less than the total num - ber of cells ; this is not the case , as shown by the following proposition based on an example suggested by T´oth [ 22 ] . Proposition 3 . For any n ∈ Z + , there exists an ar - rangement of n unit discs in R 2 for which the number of convex cells is at least b n / 4 c 2 . Proof . Choose any n . Case 1 . Suppose n mod 4 = 0 . Position two unit discs such that their centres are distance 2 − 64 / ( 16 + n 2 ) apart . It is straightforward to show that their intersection is a lune of width 64 / ( 16 + n 2 ) and height 16 n / ( 16 + n 2 ) . Observe that the height is n / 4 times the width . Therefore , n discs can be positioned such that n / 4 vertical lunes each intersect n / 4 horizontal lunes . See Figure 2C . Each lune is convex and , therefore , the intersection of two lunes is also convex , resulting in at least n 2 / 16 convex cells . Case 2 . Suppose n = 4 k + i for some k ∈ Z and some i ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 } . Given any sets of unit discs R 1 and R 2 , the number of convex cells in A R 1 ∪ R 2 is greater than or equal to the number of convex cells in A R 1 . The result follows by Case 1 since b ( 4 k + i ) / 4 c 2 = b ( 4 k ) / 4 c 2 . 4 . 2 Approximating a Geometric 1 - Centre by a Vertex 1 - Centre Facilities in a geometric 1 - centre can be positioned any - where in the plane while facilities in a vertex 1 - centre must coincide with clients . Consequently , the geometric 1 - radius of a unit disc graph is at most the vertex 1 - radius . Of course , the geometric 1 - radius can be less than the vertex 1 - radius . Theorem 4 bounds the ratio between the two radii . Theorem 4 . If UDG ( P ) is connected , then the vertex 1 - radius of UDG ( P ) is at most ﬁve times its geometric 1 - radius . This bound is tight . Proof . Choose any ﬁnite set P ⊆ R 2 . Let f ∈ R 2 be a geometric 1 - centre of P and let r denote the corresponding geometric 1 - radius . Let { c 1 , . . . , c t } be an independent set of Adj ( f ) in UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) . It follows that t ≤ 5 [ 18 ] . Partition P into P 1 , . . . , P t such that for all { i , j } ⊆ { 1 , . . . , t } , ∀ p ∈ P i , d UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) ( p , c i ) ≤ d UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) ( p , c j ) . Therefore , for any i and any { p , q } ⊆ P i , d UDG ( P ) ( p , q ) ≤ 2 r − 1 . Since UDG ( P ) is connected and k ≤ 5 , it follows that for some i and all p ∈ P , d UDG ( P ) ( c i , p ) ≤ 5 r . Therefore , the vertex 1 - radius of UDG ( P ) is at most 5 r . This bound is realized in the limit as s → ∞ by the graph G s illustrated in Figure 3 . For any s ≥ 2 , G s has geometric 1 - radius 2 + d s / 2 e ( realized by the geometric 1 - centre located at f ) and vertex 1 - radius d 5 s / 2 e . In other words , a vertex k - centre of P provides a 5 - approx - imation of its geometric k - centre when UDG ( P ) is connected . 4 . 3 Finding a Geometric 1 - Centre Building on our observations from Section 4 . 1 , we de - scribe algorithms for ﬁnding a geometric 1 - centre in Θ ( n 2 m ) path of length s f Figure 3 : illustration in support of Theorem 4 worst - case time and a nearly - optimal approximate geometric 1 - centre in Θ ( n 3 ) time ; the resulting approximate solution has eccentricity at most one greater than the geometric 1 - radius , corresponding to an additive approximation factor of at most one . 4 . 3 . 1 An Exact Solution using Breadth - First Search Chazelle and Lee [ 8 ] describe how to build the arrange - ment graph of R in O ( n 2 ) time . As the graph is constructed , for each cell C we maintain a list of discs within which C is contained ; these correspond to the neighbours of f in UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) , where f is any point in C . Since a disc can be contained in Θ ( n ) other discs , this increases the run time to O ( n 3 ) . A traversal of this graph can be used to enu - merate the cells of A R ( faces of the graph ) in O ( | A R | ) time . A geometric 1 - centre of P can be found by considering one point f from each cell in A R and using breadth - ﬁrst search to compute the eccentricity of f in UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) . The minimum such value is the geometric 1 - radius of UDG ( P ) and the corresponding point f is a geometric 1 - centre . In the pseudocode below , BFS - Depth ( G , v ) calls a standard queue - based breadth - ﬁrst search algorithm to calculate the distance from v to the furthest vertex in G . Geometric 1 - Centre ( P ) 1 radius ← ∞ 2 for each cell C ∈ A R 3 f ← any point in C 4 ecc ← BFS - Depth ( UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) , f ) 5 if ecc < radius 6 radius ← ecc 7 centre ← f 8 return centre Adding vertex f increases the number of edges in UDG ( P ) by at most n . Therefore , each call to breadth - ﬁrst search on UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) takes Θ ( n + m ) time . By Proposition 2 , | A R | ∈ O ( n 2 ) . Therefore , Geometric 1 - Centre has worst - case run time Θ ( n 2 ( m + n ) ) . Recall that UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) must be connected for a geometric 1 - centre to exist . Therefore , m ≥ n − 1 and the run time simpliﬁes to Θ ( n 2 m ) . In the worst case , therefore , this algorithm is quartic in n . 4 . 3 . 2 A Faster Approximate Solution Although it suﬃces to consider only convex cells in A R , the number of such cells remains Ω ( n 2 ) in the worst case by Proposition 3 . Therefore , the worst - case run time of Geo - metric 1 - Centre is not improved by considering only con - vex cells . As we now show , a faster algorithm is possible if we relax constraints on optimality and allow the eccentric - ity of a solution to exceed the geometric 1 - radius by at most one . As with the previous algorithm , we begin by constructing A R and the corresponding lists of discs in which each cell is contained . A point f is selected within each cell and each of these lists is partitioned according the corresponding regions R 1 ( f ) through R 6 ( f ) . These regions correspond to six sym - metric sectors whose union forms the unit disc centred at f . See Figure 4A . The algorithm computes the approximate eccentricity by iteratively calculating min C ∈A R max p ∈ P min i ∈ { 1 , . . . , 6 } ` 1 + d UDG ( P ) ( q i , p ) ´ , where f is any point in C and q i is any point in R i ( f ) . By Lemma 5 , to compute the approximate eccentricity of a point f it suﬃces to iterate over all p ∈ P and compare the graph distance between p and a point q i in P ∩ R i ( f ) for each nonempty region R i ( f ) . Adding one to the minimum of these ( at most ) six distances gives either d UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) ( f , p ) or d UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) ( f , p ) + 1 , depending on whether a shortest path from f to p passes through the point q i that was se - lected . The algorithm makes use of unweighted all - pairs shortest - path distances on the vertices of UDG ( P ) . This distance function can be precomputed in o ( mn ) time ( e . g . , see [ 7 ] ) .

For any set of points P in R 2 , any point f ∈ R 2 , and any point p ∈ P , „ 1 + min i ∈ { 1 , . . . , 6 } d UDG ( P ) ( q i , p ) − d UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) ( f , p ) « ∈ { 0 , 1 } , where q i is any point in R i ( f ) ∩ P . Proof . For any i ∈ { 1 , . . . 6 } , any two points a and b in R i ( f ) are at most unit distance apart . Consequently , a and b are adjacent in UDG ( P ) and d UDG ( P ) ( a , p ) ≤ d UDG ( P ) ( b , p ) + 1 for any p ∈ P . See Figures 4B and 4C . Any shortest path from f to p must pass through a vertex in P ∩ R i ( f ) , for some i ∈ { 1 , . . . , 6 } . The result follows .

For every point f , the sets R 1 ( f ) ∩ P through R 6 ( f ) ∩ P are precomputed in O ( n 3 ) time . Thus , a point can be selected from each set in O ( 1 ) time , giving the following theorem . Theorem 6 . Given a set of points P in R 2 , algorithm Approximate Geometric 1 - Centre identiﬁes a point f ∈ R 2 in O ( n 3 ) time such that ecc UDG ( P ∪ { f } ) ( P , { f } ) ≤ r + 1 , where r denotes the geometric 1 - radius of P and n = | P | . 4 . 4 Finding a Geometric k - Centre for a Fixed k When k is ﬁxed , our Geometric 1 - Centre algorithm generalizes to give an O ( mn 2 k ) - time algorithm for ﬁnding a geometric k - centre of a unit disc graph . We begin with the following observation : Observation 7 . Given a set of points P ⊆ R 2 and a set of points F ⊆ R 2 that forms a geometric k - centre of P , for every client p ∈ P , some shortest path in UDG ( P ∪ F ) from p to a facility f ∈ F nearest to p does not contain any facility f 0 ∈ F , where f 0 6 = f . An analogous property also holds for a vertex k - centre of any graph . As a consequence of Observation 7 , edges con - necting two facilities need not be considered when selecting locations for a geometric k - centre . Any two or more facili - ties located in a cell of A R serve the same set of clients in P , resulting in redundant facilities . Therefore , by Proposi - tion 2 , it suﬃces to consider at most ` n 2 − n + 2 k ´ combinations for assigning k facilities to cells in A R . For each combination of cells , we calculate the corresponding eccentricity . Thus , the Geometric 1 - Centre algorithm is modiﬁed such that the outer loop considers all combinations of k cells . In this case , BFS - Depth ( G , V ) begins breadth - ﬁrst search at the vertices in the set V , returning the eccentricity of V in graph G . The corresponding run time is at most ( n + m ) n 2 − n + 2 k ! ∈ O ( mn 2 k ) . This gives the following theorem . Theorem 8 . For any ﬁxed k ∈ Z + , a geometric k - centre of a set of n unit discs in R 2 can be found in O ( mn 2 k ) time . Geometric k - Centre ( P ) 1 radius ← ∞ 2 for each combination of cells C = { C 1 , . . . , C k } ⊆ A R 3 F ← ∅ 4 for each C i ∈ C 5 f i ← any point in C i 6 F ← F ∪ f i 7 ecc ← BFS - Depth ( UDG ( P ∪ F ) , F ) 8 if ecc < radius 9 radius ← ecc 10 Centres ← F 11 return Centres 4 . 5 Finding a Geometric k - Centre for an Ar - bitrary k In the last section we described an O ( mn 2 k ) - time algo - rithm for ﬁnding a geometric k - centre of a unit disc graph . Of course this run time is exponential if k is an arbitrary input parameter to the problem . In this section we show that Geometric k - Centre is NP - hard on unit disc graphs when k is not ﬁxed . This implies NP - hardness for the more general problem , that is , on intersection graphs of sets of regions in two or more dimensions . Theorem 9 . When k is an arbitrary input parameter , the geometric k - centre problem on unit disc graphs is NP - hard . Proof . Given a graph G = ( V , E ) and an integer k , the Dominating Set decision problem is to determine whether there exists a set D ⊆ V such that | D | ≤ k and every vertex in V is adjacent to some vertex in D . Dominating Set remains NP - hard if G is a grid graph [ 9 , 19 ] . Choose any ﬁnite set of points P ⊆ Z 2 and any integers k ≥ 1 and i ≥ 0 . Let s = 2 i + 1 and r = 3 i + 1 . Let f : Z 2 → Z 2 denote the uniform scaling function deﬁned by f ( ( p x , p y ) ) = ( sp x , sp y ) . Similarly , let f − 1 ( ( p x , p y ) ) = ( p x / s , p y / s ) . If A is a set , let f ( A ) = { f ( p ) | p ∈ A } . Let P 0 = f ( P ) ∪ { ( sx + i , sy ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ s − 1 and { ( x , y ) , ( x + 1 , y ) } ⊆ P } ∪ { ( sx , sy + i ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ s − 1 } and { ( x , y ) , ( x , y + 1 ) } ⊆ P } . For each p ∈ P 0 , let g ( p ) denote the unique point in f ( P ) that is nearest to p in UDG ( P 0 ) by graph distance . There - fore , ∀ p ∈ P 0 d UDG ( P 0 ) ( p , g ( p ) ) ≤ b s / 2 c . ( 3 ) Since the points of P 0 lie on the unit grid , GG ( P 0 ) = UDG ( P 0 ) . Furthermore , GG ( P ) is a minor of UDG ( P 0 ) . That is , GG ( P ) is equal to UDG ( P 0 ) upon scaling the grid by a factor of s and replacing each edge by a path of length s . See Figure 5 . We claim that GG ( P ) has a dominating set of cardinality UDG ( P’ ) GG ( P ) GG DOMINATING SET GG r−DOMINATING SET GG VERTEX k−CENTRE UDG VERTEX k−CENTRE GG GEOMETRIC k−CENTRE UDG GEOMETRIC k−CENTRE Figure 5 : ( Left ) GG ( P ) has a dominating set of cardinality k if and only if UDG ( P 0 ) has a geometric k - centre of radius r . In this example s = 3 and r = 4 . ( Right ) In Theorem 9 we describe a reduction from Dominating Set on grid graphs to Geometric k - Centre on unit disc graphs . The hardness of other problems in this hierarchy can be derived by a reduction corresponding to a subset of the steps described in our proof of Theorem 9 . at most k if and only if UDG ( P 0 ) has a geometric k - centre of radius r . Case 1 . ( ⇒ ) Suppose GG ( P ) has a dominating set , de - noted by D , of cardinality at most k . Observe that f ( D ) ⊆ P 0 . Furthermore , ∀ q ∈ f ( P ) ∃ t ∈ f ( D ) such that d UDG ( P 0 ) ( q , t ) ≤ s . ( 4 ) By the triangle inequality , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) , ∀ p ∈ P 0 ∃ t ∈ f ( D ) such that d UDG ( P 0 ) ( p , t ) ≤ s + b s / 2 c = r . Therefore , f ( D ) is a geometric k - centre of P 0 with radius r . Case 2 . ( ⇐ ) Suppose UDG ( P 0 ) has a geometric k - centre of radius r . By Deﬁnition 2 , there exists a set F ⊆ R 2 such that | F | ≤ k and ∀ p ∈ P 0 ∃ q ∈ F such that d UDG ( P 0 ∪ F ) ( p , q ) ≤ r . For any t ∈ R 2 , there exists some q ∈ P 0 such that N ( t ) ⊆ N ( q ) in UDG ( P 0 ∪ { t } ) . By Observation 7 , no two facilities need to be adjacent in UDG ( P 0 ∪ F ) . Consequently , there exists a set F 0 ⊆ P 0 such that | F 0 | ≤ k and ∀ p ∈ P 0 ∃ q ∈ F 0 such that d UDG ( P 0 ) ( p , q ) ≤ r . ( 5 ) By the triangle inequality , ( 5 ) , and ( 3 ) , ∀ p ∈ P 0 ∃ q ∈ F 0 such that d UDG ( P 0 ) ( p , g ( q ) ) ≤ r + b s / 2 c < 2 s . ( 6 ) Observe that ∀ { p 1 , p 2 } ⊆ f ( P ) d UDG ( P 0 ) ( p 1 , p 2 ) mod s = 0 . ( 7 ) Therefore , by ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , and since g ( q ) ∈ f ( P ) , ∀ p ∈ f ( P ) ∃ q ∈ F 0 such that d UDG ( P 0 ) ( p , g ( q ) ) ≤ s . Consequently , ∀ p ∈ P ∃ q ∈ F 0 such that d GG ( P ) ( p , f − 1 ( g ( q ) ) ≤ 1 . Let D = f − 1 ( g ( F 0 ) ) . Since | F 0 | ≤ k , therefore | D | ≤ k and D is a dominating set of GG ( P ) whose cardinality is at most k . 5 . DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH Motivated by gateway placement in wireless networks , we have examined the problem of ﬁnding a geometric k - centre in unit disc graphs . Of course , unit disc graphs are not the only model for representing wireless networks . In addition to the results described in this paper , we have considered the geometric k - centre problem in one - dimension ( i . e . , on inter - val graphs ) , resulting in linear - time algorithms for ﬁnding a geometric 1 - centre and 2 - centre and an O ( n log n ) - time algo - rithm for ﬁnding a geometric k - centre . Details are omitted due to space constraints . As well , we have partial results for generalizations to the setting of disc graphs ( intersection graphs of discs of diﬀering radii ) , to three dimensions , and to rectangle intersection graphs . Another possible direction is to model obstacles and in - terference in wireless networks by applying the geometric k - centre problem to the setting of visibility graphs . Given a set of points P ( clients ) in a polygonal region R , the ob - jective is to select a set F of k points ( facilities ) in R such that the maximum graph distance between any client and its nearest facility is minimized in the visibility graph of P ∪ F in R ; a pair of nodes is connected in the visibility graph if and only if the line segment between them is unobstructed by polygon R . By applying observations similar to those made in Section 4 . 1 , a solution can be found discretely and , furthermore , the corresponding partition of the plane into visibility regions is a partial order relation for which it suf - ﬁces to consider the sinks . Thus , visibility graphs seems like a natural setting to which to apply some of the ideas devel - oped in this paper . See [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] for results on properties of visibility regions and the corresponding partial order . One might consider generalizations of the optimization function that is minimized in selecting positions for gate - ways . In particular , two fundamental problems of facility location are the k - centre and k - median problems . In this paper we restrict attention to the ﬁrst of these . The two problems are deﬁned analogously , with the exception that the maximum over all R i ∈ R in ( 1 ) is replaced by a sum - mation over all R i ∈ R . Whereas a geometric k - centre min - imizes the maximum node - to - gateway distance , a geometric k - median minimizes the average node - to - gateway distance . The algorithms for ﬁnding a geometric 1 - centre and geo - metric k - centre for a ﬁxed k presented in this paper are straightforward to adapt to identify a geometric 1 - median or geometric k - median , respectively . In this case , each call to BFS - Depth is replaced by a call to BFS - Sum , which returns the corresponding sum of the distances from every node to the nearest gateway . The resulting run times remain O ( mn 2 ) and O ( mn 2 k ) , respectively . Finally , can a geometric 1 - centre of a unit disc graph be found in O ( n 3 ) worst - case time ? That is , can our O ( n 2 m ) - time algorithm be improved ? Cubic time is a natural goal for solving this problem since the fastest known algorithms for ﬁnding a vertex 1 - centre run in nearly O ( n 3 ) time .
