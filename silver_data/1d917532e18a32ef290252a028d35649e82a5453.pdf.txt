Inhibition of the Interactions of Cofilin , Destrin , and Deoxyribonuclease I with Actin by Phosphoinositides * ( Received for publication , December 15 , 1989 ) Naoto Yonezawa , Eisuke Nishidas , Kazuko IidaQ , Ichiro Yaharag , and Hikoichi Sakai From the Department of Biophysics and Biochemistry , Faculty of Science , University of Tokyo , Hongo , Tokyo 113 , Japan and the SDepartment of Cell Biology , the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , Hon - Komagome , Tokyo 113 , Japan Cofilin is a widely distributed actin - modulating pro - tein that has the ability to bind along the side of F - actin and to depolymerize F - actin in a pa - dependent manner . We found that phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , phos - phatidylinositol4 - monophosphate ( PIP ) , and phospha - tidylinositol4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) inhibited both ac - tions of cofilin in a dose - dependent manner , while ino - sitol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( IPa ) , 1 - oleoyl - 2 - acetylgly - cerol ( OAG ) , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , or phosphati - dylcholine ( PC ) had little or no effect on them . Gel filtration analyses showed that PIP2 bound to cofilin and thereby inhibited the binding of cofilin to G - actin . Destrin is a mammalian , pH - independent actin - depo - lymerizing protein . The actin - depolymerizing activity of destrin was also inhibited by PI , PIP , and PIP2 , but not by IP3 , OAG , PS , or PC . In addition , we found further that an actin - depolymerizing activity of bovine pancreas deoxyribonuclease I , a G - actin - sequestering protein , was inhibited by PIP and PIP2 , but not by PI , IP3 , OAG , PS , or PC . These results together with pre - vious findings ( Lassing , I . , and Lindberg , U . ( 1985 ) Nature 314 , 472 - 474 ; Janmey , P . A . , and Stossel , T . P . ( 1987 ) Nature 325 , 362 - 364 ) suggest that the sen - sitivity to polyphosphoinositides may be a common feature in vitro among actin - binding proteins that can bind to G - actin and regulate the state of actin polym - erization . Cofilin is a widely distributed actin - binding protein with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa on SDS’ - polyacryl - amide gel electrophoresis ( l - 5 ) . It has the ability to bind to both G - and F - actin under physiological conditions . Thus , cofilin not only binds along F - actin with a 1 : l molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer , but also binds to G - actin in the same 1 : l molar ratio ( 1 ) . Cofilin depolymerizes F - actin par - tially at near neutral pH ( < 7 . 3 ) and completely at more alkaline pH ( > 7 . 3 ) . This pH - dependent change in the depo - lymerizing activity is reversible , so cofilin could be a pH - sensitive regulator of actin polymerization ( 6 ) .

Destrin is a mammalian actin - depolymerizing protein with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa on SDS - polyacryl - amide gel electrophoresis ( 8 - 10 ) . Similar low molecular mass ( 15 - 19 kDa ) actin - binding proteins have been identified in other organisms : actin - depolymerizing factor in chick embryo brain ( 11 , 12 ) , depactin in echinodermatous oocytes and eggs ( 13 ) , and actophorin in Acanthamoeba ( 14 ) . These proteins can rapidly depolymerize F - actin in a pH - independent man - ner by taking actin molecules away from the entire length of F - actin . Recent cDNA cloning studies have shown that the amino acid sequence of destrin , consisting of 165 amino acid residues , is very similar ( 71 % identical ) to that of cofilin which consists of 166 amino acid residues ( 7 , 15 ) . It has been reported that polyphosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIPJ and phosphati - dylinositol 4 - monophosphate ( PIP ) cause the dissociation of profilactin by interacting with profilin in uitro ( 16 ) . The function of Ca’ + - sensitive actin - severing proteins , gelsolin and villin , is also modulated by PIP , and PIP in uitro . These polyphosphoinositides can inhibit their actin - severing activi - ties and induce dissociation of gelsolin - actin complex ( 17 - 19 ) . Recently , Hartwig et al . ( 20 ) have suggested the possibility of the interaction of gelsolin with polyphosphoinositides in vivo , on the basis of their observation that part of gelsolin localizes with plasma and intracellular membranes . It is interesting to examine whether phosphoinositides af - fect the interaction of cofilin or destrin with actin , because cofilin and destrin belong to another class of actin - binding proteins with gelsolin , villin , and profilin . In this paper , we show that phosphoinositides inhibit the binding of cofilin to F - actin , the actin - depolymerizing activity of cofilin and des - trin , and the actin - depolymerizing activity of DNase I , a G - actin - sequestering protein . We further demonstrate the direct binding of PIP , to cofilin . MATERIALS AND METHODS Proteins - Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle by the method of Spudich and Watt ( 21 ) and further purified by Sephadex G - 100 gel filtration column equilibrated with 2 mM Hepes , 0 . 1 mM CaCl * , 0 . 01 % NaNa , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 0 . 05 mM DTT , pH 7 . 9 . Porcine brain cofilin was purified by the previously described method ( 22 ) . The method of preparing cofilin expressed in Escherichia coli was previously described ( 15 ) . Briefly , porcine brain cofilin cDNA con - taining the entire open reading frame was ligated to the downstream of 1acZ in the expression vector pUCl9 . Cofilin was then expressed in E . coli HBlOl , and the extract of HBlOl was prepared by lysozyme treatment followed by freeze - thawing . Cofilin was then purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography and gel filtration . We call this cof - ilin recombinant cofilin in this paper . Recombinant cofilin has an additional sequence , Thr - Met - Ile - Thr - Pro - Ser - Ser - Gly - Asn on the authentic N terminus of porcine brain cofilin . Therefore , its apparent 8382 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 16 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Inhibition of Cofilin and Destrin by Phosphoinositides 8383 molecular mass on SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a little larger than that of porcine brain cofilin . The mode of interaction of recombinant cofilin with actin was indistinguishable from that of porcine brain cofilin ( Ref . 15 , see “Results” ) . Destrin was purified from porcine brains by using DNase I affinity column chromatogra - phy as previously described ( 9 , 10 ) . Bovine pancreas DNase I was purchased from Sigma . DNase I gave no other contaminating bands on SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . Chemicals - Phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , PIP , PIP * , phosphatidylser - ine ( PS ) , phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , mositol 1 , 4 , 5triphosphate ( IPa ) , and 1 - oleoly - 2 - acetylglycerol ( OAG ) were all purchased from Sigma . The lipids except IP , were dissolved in water to a final concentration of 1 mg / ml and sonicated three times for 10 s in a sonicator . IP3 was dissolved in water to a final concentration of 0 . 1 mg / ml . The suspen - sions were frozen at - 80 “C in O . l - ml aliquots . The lipid solution was quickly thawed in warm water and sonicated in a sonicator three times for 10 s just before use . Assays for the Binding of Cofilin to F - actin and the Actin - depo - lymerizing Activities of Cofilin , Destrin , and DNase I - Recombinant cofilin , porcine brain cofilin , destrin , or DNase I was first incubated with lipids or IP3 for 10 min at 25 “C , then the aliquot of polymerized actin was added , and the solution ( final 100 ~ 1 ) was incubated at 25 “C for various times . The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 356 , 000 x g for 15 min at 25 “C . The supernatant was saved and the pellet was suspended in 100 ~ 1 of 1 % SDS . Equal volumes of the supernatant and pellet were electrophoresed on SDS - polyacrylamide gels . Since the staining intensities of proteins were linear , in the range of 0 . 3 - 3 pg / lane , in our SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic experiments , we adjusted the sample volume of pellet or supernatant fractions electrophoresed in one lane within this range . After staining and destaining the gels , the staining intensities of both the pellet and supernatant fractions were determined with a densitometer ( Beck - man ) , and the amount of each protein in pellets and supernatants was determined by using the equation : ( Amount of each protein in pellet or supernatant ) = [ ( staining intensity of pellet or supernatant ) / ( staining intensity of pellet plus that of the supernatant ) ] x ( amount of each protein in the reaction solution ) . SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 13 % polyacrylamide separating gels as described by Laemmli ( 23 ) . Other Assays - DNase I inhibition assay was performed as de - scribed by Blikstad et al . ( 24 ) . Pyrene - labeled actin was prepared as described previously ( 1 , 25 ) . Changes in fluorescence intensity of pyrene - labeled actin were measured at 25 or 37 “C with a Hitachi 650 - 10s fluorescence spectrophotometer . Excitation and emission wavelengths were 365 and 407 nm , respectively , RESULTS Effect of Polyphosphoinositides on the Binding of Cofilin to F - actin - Recombinant cofilin was purified to homogeneity as described under “Materials and Methods” and was indistin - guishable from porcine brain cofilin in its interaction with actin ( Ref . 15 , see below ) . Porcine brain cofilin and recombi - nant cofilin bound to F - actin in the same dose - dependent manner at pH 7 . 0 , and the saturation levels of both cofilins were about 0 . 7 - 0 . & l molar ratio of bound cofilin to actin molecules in F - actin under the assay conditions of Fig . 1 . When increasing concentrations of recombinant cofilin were reacted with F - actin in the presence of a fixed concentration of brain cofilin , the molar ratio of recombinant cofilin to brain cofilin in the F - actin pellet was nearly the same as that in the initial reaction mixture ( Table I ) . These results suggest that both cofilins have nearly the same affinity for F - actin . AS shown in Fig . lA , the amount of porcine brain cofilin bound to F - actin was decreased by PIP2 in a dose - dependent manner . In the presence of a 5O : l molar ratio of PIP , to cofilin , cofilin could not bind to F - actin at all . The binding of recombinant cofilin to F - actin was also inhibited by PIP2 in almost the same dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1B ) . We fur - ther investigated the effects of other phospholipids and IPs on the binding of recombinant cofilin to F - actin . PIP had almost the same inhibitory effect as PIPB , and PI had a slightly weaker inhibitory effect than PIP and PIP , . On the other hand , PC , PS , OAG , and IP , did not inhibit the cofilin 0 50 100 Phosphollpldslcofilin ( molar ratio ) FIG . 1 .

Porcine brain cofilin ( A , final concentration 3 . 2 pM ) or recombinant cofilin ( B , final concentration 3 . 1 PM ) was incubated with various concentrations of each lipid for 10 min at 25 “C . The molar ratio of each lipid to cofilin is indicated in the figure ( abscissa ) . F - actin ( final concentration 3 . 2 FM ) was added to the mixtures , and after the incubation for 40 min at 25 “C the samples were centrifuged . The amounts of sedimented actin and sedimented cofilin were deter - mined as described under “Materials and Methods . ” Buffer conditions were 25 mM Hepes , 4 mM Pipes , 0 . 01 mM Ca & , 75 mM KCl , 0 . 02 mM ATP , and 0 . 07 mM DTT , pH 7 . 0 . 0 , 0 , X , m , Cl , A , and A indicate PIP2 , PIP , PI , IP , , OAG , PC , and PS , respectively , in both A and B . TABLE I Competition of recombinant cofilin and porcine brain cofilin in the binding to F - actin Various concentrations of recombinant cofilin ( final concentra - tions 0 , 1 . 5 , or 6 . 0 FM ) were incubated with F - actin ( final concentra - tion 3 . 1 FM ) in the presence of a fixed concentration of porcine brain cofilin ( final concentration 3 . 4 PM ) for 20 min , and then the samples were centrifuged . The amounts of recombinant and porcine brain cofilin bound to F - actin ( D and E ) were determined as described under “Materials and Methods . ” Buffer conditions were 8 mM Pipes , 0 . 2 mM Hepes , 0 . 5 mM imidazole , 75 mM KCl , 2 mM MgC & 0 . 02 mM CaCb , 0 . 02 mM ATP , and 0 . 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 1 . pb - cofilin , porcine brain cofilin ; r - cofilin , recombinant cofilin .

It should be noted that none of the phospholipids and IP3 affected the polymerization level of actin in the absence of cofilin . It is known that an increase in the fluorescence intensity of pyrene labeled to actin accompanies polymerization of actin ( 25 ) . When F - actin ( final concentration 4 . 0 PM ) containing 1 % pyrene - labeled actin was mixed with recombinant cofilin ( final concentration 4 . 1 PM ) at pH 8 . 3 , the fluorescence inten - sity of the pyrene was decreased to nearly zero because of the binding of cofilin to actin , as previously reported ( 1 ) . Prior incubation of cofilin with PIP , ( final concentration 360 pM ) inhibited this cofilin - induced decrease of fluorescence inten - sity almost completely ( data not shown ) . This result also suggests that the binding of cofilin to F - actin is inhibited by PIP , . When PIP , ( final concentration 850 pM ) was added to the mixture of F - actin ( final concentration 4 . 0 pM ) and cofilin ( final concentration 4 . 1 ELM ) at 37 “C , the fluorescence inten - by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 16 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 8384 Inhibition of Cofilin and De & in by Phosphoinositides sity was gradually increased from nearly the zero level to that of F - actin in the absence of cofilin within 30 min ( data not shown ) . This result indicates that dissociation of cofilin from F - actin occurs by the action of PIP2 . Effect of Polyphosphoinositides on the Actin - depolymerizing Actiuity of Cofilin - Porcine brain cofilin has a pH - dependent actin - depolymerizing activity ( 6 ) . Recombinant cofdin also depolymerized F - actin in a pH - dependent manner ( 15 ) . The actin - depolymerizing activity at pH 8 . 3 and the relatively weak actin - depolymerizing activity at pH 7 . 0 of both brain cofilin ( Fig . W ) and recombinant cofilin ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) were reduced to the half level in the presence of about a 2O : l molar ratio of PIP2 to cotilin and were almost completely inhibited in the presence of 50 - 100 molar ratio of PIP , to cofilin . PIP and PI also inhibited the actin - depolymerizing activity of cofilin ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) in a concentration - dependent manner . But , PC , PS , OAG , and IP3 had little or no inhibitory effect on it ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . It has been shown that incubation of PIP , with divalent cations prior to mixing with gelsolin decreases the ability of PIP , to inhibit the actin - severing function of gelsolin ( 18 ) . We have then examined the effect of Mg2 + ions on the action of PIP2 , PIP , and PI on cotilin . Prior to the mixing with recombinant cofilin , PIPp , PIP , or PI was incubated in the solution containing 2 mM MgCl * at 25 “C for 20 min . In this case , the inhibitory effects of PIPz , PIP , or PI on the cofilin binding to F - actin and on the actin - depolymerizing activity of cofilin were decreased by 80 % . On the other hand , addition of Mg” after mixing PIP2 with cofilin caused no decrease in the inhibitory effects of PIP2 ( data not shown ) . These results are consistent with the previous report examining the effect 0 50 100 Phosphollplds / cotilln ( molar ratio ) FIG . 2 . Inhibition of the actin - depolymerizing activity of cofilin by phosphoinositides . Porcine brain cofilin ( A , final con - centration 3 . 2 LLM ) or recombinant cofilin ( B and C , final concentra - tion 3 . 1 FM ) was incubated with the various concentrations of each linid for 10 min at 25 “C . The molar ratio of each lipid to cofilin is indicated in the figure ( abscissa ) . F - actin ( final concentration 3 . 2 PM ) was added to the mixtures , and after the incubation for 40 min at 25 “C the samples were centrifuged . The amounts of nonsedimented actin were determined as described under “Materials and Methods . ” Buffer conditions were 4 mM Pipes , 0 . 01 mM CaC & , 75 mM KCI , 0 . 02 mM ATP , 0 . 07 mM DTT , and either 25 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 0 , or 25 mM Tris , pH 8 . 3 .

Interaction of PIP , with Cofilin - We have examined whether PIP2 binds to cofilin or actin by gel filtration chro - matography . Sephadex G - 100 gel filtration column chroma - tographies were carried out in the presence of 100 mM NaCl . PIP2 forms small micelles of molecular mass 93 , 000 Da ( 26 ) and was eluted near the void volume ( Fig . 3A , - ) . When a low concentration of G - actin with ( 0 ) or without ( 0 ) PIP2 was passed through the column , actin was eluted at the position corresponding to a monomer in both cases ( Fig . 3A ) , indicating that PIP , does not bind to actin under the condi - tions used . In contrast , the elution position of cofilin changed when cofilin mixed with PIP , was passed through the column . Almost all the cofilin was co - eluted with PIP2 near the void volume ( Fig . 3B , A ) . This clearly indicates that PIP2 binds to cofilin . Next , a mixture of cofilin and actin ( 2 : l molar ratio ) without ( Fig . 3C ) or with ( Fig . 30 ) PIP , was passed through the column . In Fig . 3C , elution profiles of actin ( 0 ) and cofilin ( A ) are shown . Without PIPS about 70 % of the actin was eluted at the position of the actin - cofilin complex and the remainder was eluted at the position of G - actin , while about 3o A * cm .

We confirmed by actin polymer - ization assays with UV measurements as well as fluorescence meas - urements of pyrene - labeled actin that under the same conditions used here no sign of polymerization of actin ( - 1 pM ) was detected irre - spective of the presence or absence of cofilin or PIP * within 1 h .

The molar ratio of each lipid to destrin is located in the figure ( absci . ssa ) . F - actin ( final concentration 2 . 5 pM ) was added to the mixtures . After the incubation for 30 min at 25 “C , the mixtures were centrifuged . The amounts of nonsedimented actin were determined as described under “Materials and Methods . ” Buffer conditions were 20 mM Hepes , 4 mM Pipes , 70 mM KCl , 0 . 01 mM CaC12 , and 0 . 02 mM ATP , pH 7 . 0 . The amount of nonsedimented actin in the absence of phospholipids or IP , was - 1 . 5 PM , and this was regarded as 100 % . 0 , 0 , X , n , 0 , A , and A indicate PIP , , PIP , PI , IP , , OAG , PC , and PS , respectively . 25 % of the cofilin was eluted at the position of actin - cofilin complex . Thus , the molar ratio of cofilin to actin at the position of the actin - cofilin complex was about 0 . 6 . This relatively low ratio may result from dissociation of cofilin from actin during the elution because of the low concentration of actin and cofilin . When a mixture of cofilin and actin with PIP ? ( 5O : l molar ratio to cofilin ) was passed through the column , cofilin was co - eluted with PIPs near the void volume ( Fig . 30 , A ) and almost all actin eluted at the position corresponding to a monomer ( Fig . 30 , O ) . ’ These results clearly indicate that PIP2 binds to cofilin and thereby inhibits the interaction of cofilin with actin . Effect of Phosphoinositides on the Actin - depolymerizing Ac - tivity of Destrin - Destrin is a mammalian , pH - and Ca * + - independent actin depolymerizing protein ( 8 , 9 ) , whose amino acid sequence has been revealed to be very similar to that of cofilin ( 7 , 15 ) . Therefore , we have asked whether the activity of destrin is also regulated by phosphoinositides . Fig . 4 shows that PIP2 ( 0 ) and PIP ( 0 ) inhibited the ability of destrin to depolymerize F - actin in nearly the same dose - dependent man - ner . The half - maximal inhibitory effect was seen at about a 1O : l molar ratio of PIP or PIP2 to destrin . Therefore , their inhibitory effect on the activity of destrin is slightly stronger than that on cofilin’s activity . PI showed a slightly weaker inhibitory effect on the activity of destrin than PIP and PIP * , but PS , PC , IP . ? , and OAG had little or no inhibitory effects ( Fig . 4 ) . Effect of Polyphosphoinositides on the Actin - depolymerizing Activity of DNase I - We found that the nuclease activity of ’ The peak position of actin eluted in the experiment shown in Fig . 30 ( 0 ) was slightly shifted from that of actin monomer shown in Fig . 3A ( O ) , indicating some weak interactions of actin with cofilin and / or PIP , under the conditions used . Part of cofilin might be complexed with actin under the conditions , because the actin - depolymerizing activity of cofilin was not inhibited completely in the presence of about a 5O : l molar ratio of PIP2 to cotilin , as shown in Fig . 2 . Moreover , our preliminary experiment showed that in the absence of NaCl , i . e . under the conditions of low ionic strength , actin was co - eluted with PIP , near the void volume . Therefore , even in the pres - ence of 100 mM NaCl a weak interaction might exist between actin and PIP ? . This may partly account for a very slight shift of elution of actin in the presence of PIP ? , as was observed in Fig . 3A ( 0 and 0 ) and Fig . 30 ( 0 ) . 01 0 50 100 Phospholipids / DNasel lmdar ratlo ) FIG . 5 . Effect of phosphoinositides on the actin - depolymer - izing activity of DNase I . Bovine pancreas DNase I ( final concen - tration 3 . 0 pM ) was incubated with various concentrations of each lipid for 10 min at 25 “C . The molar ratio of each lipid to DNase I added is indicated in figure ( abscissa ) . F - actin ( final concentration 2 . 6 NM ) was added to the mixtures . After the incubation for 90 min at 25 “C , the mixtures were centrifuged . Buffer conditions were 12 mM Hepes , 0 . 1 mM CaCl * , and 60 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 . The amounts of nonsedimented actin were determined as described under “Materials and Methods . ” The amount of nonsedimented actin in the absence of lipids was - 1 . 6 PM , and this is shown as 100 % . 0 , 0 , X , W , 0 , A , and A indicate PIP ? , PIP , PI , IPZ , OAG , PC , and PS , respectively . DNase I was inhibited by PIP * . The inhibition by PIP2 was dose - dependent and about an 8O : l molar ratio of PIP2 to DNase I was required for the half - maximal inhibition ( data not shown ) . It has been shown that DNase I can induce a relatively slow depolymerization of F - actin by sequestering monomeric actins which are in equilibrium with F - actin ( 27 - 29 ) . Then , we have examined the effect of phosphoinositides on the actin - depolymerizing activity of DNase I . PIP2 and PIP inhibited the actin - depolymerizing activity of DNase I in a dose - dependent manner and the half - maximal inhibitions were obtained at about 25 : l and 5O : l molar ratios of PIP2 and PIP to DNase I , respectively ( Fig . 5 ) . These inhibitory effects of PIP , and PIP on DNase I were slightly weaker than those on cofilin and destrin . Although PI inhibited the actions of cofilin and destrin ( Figs . 1 , 2 , and 4 ) , it did not inhibit the actin - depolymerizing activity of DNase I ( Fig . 5 , X ) . PS , PC , IP3 , and OAG had little or no effect on the action of DNase I ( Fig . 5 ) as in the case of cofilin or destrin . Thus , the sensitivity of DNase I to phosphoinositides is somewhat different from that of cofilin or destrin . DISCUSSION It has already been reported that polyphosphoinositides affect the functions of a G - actin - sequestering protein , profilin ( 16 ) , and Ca * ‘ - sensitive actin - severing / capping proteins , gel - solin ( 17 - 19 ) and villin ( 19 ) in uitro . In this study , we have found that besides these actin - regulatory proteins , an F - actin - side - binding and - depolymerizing protein , cofilin , and actin - depolymerizing / severing protein , destrin , and a G - actin se - questering protein , DNase I , are sensitive to polyphosphoin - ositides . Gel filtration column chromatography on Sephadex G - 100 revealed that PIP , binds to cotilin but not to actin . It has also been reported that PIP2 binds to profilin ( 16 ) and gelsolin ( 18 ) in uitro . As PIP2 inhibits the functions of destrin , DNase I and villin , PIP2 may bind to these proteins , too . Thus , at least these six kinds of actin - binding proteins have the ability to bind to PIP , . It is interesting that the cross - linking site in the actin sequence for DNase I , the segment of 48 - 82 amino acid residues ( 31 ) , is different from the sites for gelsolin and cofilin , which have been determined to be the N - terminal and / or C - terminal portions of actin ( 3 , 30 ) . Furthermore , by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 16 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 8386 Inhibition of Cofilin and Destrin by Phosphoinositides these actin - binding proteins are clearly different from one another in their mode of interaction with actin as described above . Therefore , despite the common feature of the sensitiv - ity to PIPz , the molecular mechanism underlying the inter - action with actin may not be common among these proteins . Previous studies using gelsolin fragments generated by lim - ited proteolysis ( 32 ) or by gene truncation of plasma gelsolin cDNA ( 33 ) revealed that the PIP2 binding site on the gelsolin sequence is on an 11 - amino acid sequence ( 150 - 160 amino acid residues ) . It is also suggested that this 11 - amino acid sequence may be the F - actin - side - binding site ( 33 ) . Neither cofilin nor destrin has a sequence similar to the 11 - amino acid sequence . Therefore , we do not know at present whether a consensus motif for the phosphoinositide - binding sites of these actin - binding proteins exists . Both PIP2 and PIP inhibit the function of gelsolin , villin , profilin , cofilin , destrin , and DNase I in uitro . PI has an inhibitory effect on cofilin ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) and destrin ( Fig . 4 ) but has little or no effect on gelsolin ( 18 ) , profilin ( IS ) , and DNase I ( Fig . 5 ) . The effect of PI on the function of villin has not yet been reported . Thus , there is a slight but clear differ - ence in the sensitivity to different phosphoinositides between these actin - binding proteins . Cofilin and destrin have distinct but similar actin - modulating functions in vitro and their amino acid sequences are highly homologous ( 15 ) . This study has shown that , in addition to these similarities , cofilin and destrin share the common feature of the sensitivity to PIP * , PIP , and PI . It has not been determined whether the function of other actin - binding proteins , such as a - actinin , filamin , and tropo - myosin , is inhibited by phosphoinositides , although it was reported that a - actinin forms a complex with diacylglycerol and palmitic acid ( 34 ) . It can be concluded , however , that a sensitivity to polyphosphoinositides in vitro is a common feature at least among the actin - binding proteins that bind to G - actin and regulate the polymerization state of actin .
