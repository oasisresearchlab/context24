Correspondence 474 www . thelancet . com Vol 380 August 4 , 2012 in representation in academic sciences are clear , less is known about disparities in important indicators of research success that might partly account for such diﬀ erences , such as success in obtaining funding . 2 – 4 For instance , the equity of amounts awarded to male and female awardees has not been assessed . We used publicly available data from grants awarded from Oct 1 , 2000 , to Sept 30 , 2008 , by a major UK biomedical funding body , the Wellcome Trust , to assess grant funding amounts awarded to women versus men . Gender was assigned to each primary recipient on the basis of name , with consensus agreement by GB and NTVD ( internet searches resolved disagreements ) . Data were available on 10 283 awards made to 7015 individuals . We compared monetary diﬀ erences by gender using ANOVA , with adjustment for rank ( predoctoral , doctoral , professorial ) . Awards ranged from £150 to £16·8 million ( mean £281 284 , SD 7·54 ) . After correction for a main eﬀ ect of academic rank ( F [ 2 , 10283 ] = 158·97 , p < 0·0001 ) , there was a signiﬁ cant gender diﬀ erence , with men awarded on average £44 735 more than women ( F [ 1 , 10283 ] = 6·54 , p = 0·011 ; ﬁ gure ) . We also calculated a yearly rate ; a similar pattern was noted for academic rank ( F [ 2 , 10250 ] = 62·93 , p < 0·0001 ) and gender ( F [ 2 , 10250 ] = 9·13 , p = 0·003 ) , with men again awarded more than women . Our analysis shows that women received smaller grants from the Wellcome Trust , on average , than did men during this period . In the UK , it is unusual for a grant to be awarded for an amount less than that applied for , and previous ﬁ ndings 5 indicate that success rates for research fellowships and project grants administered by the UK’s Wellcome Trust are equivalent for men and women , although fewer women apply for grants than would be expected . Thus , in our opinion , the most likely explanation for the diﬀ erence in * Mohamed Ag Ayoya , Ariel Higgins - Steele , Donatella Massai , Chantal Umutoni , Asako Saegusa , Jean - Claude Mubalama , Stephanie Kleschnitzki , Sandra Lattouf , Solofo Ramaroson , Françoise Gruloos - Ackermans mayoya @ unicef . org UNICEF , Port - au - Prince , Haiti 1 Ministry of Public Health and Population .

Gender inequality in awarded research grants Under - representation of women at higher levels of faculty in the biomedical sciences has long been noted . 1 However , whereas diﬀ erences amounts awarded to women and men is that women are systematically less ambitious in the amounts of funding requested in their grant applications . If we are correct , this represents a potentially modiﬁ able target . Mentors throughout the academic career pathway should ensure that women are as ambitious as men in their outlook , and in their grant proposals ; men should be encouraged to be economical when costing such applications . We declare that we have no conﬂ icts of interest . * Gillinder Bedi , Nicholas T Van Dam , Marcus Munafo gb2326 @ columbia . edu Division on Substance Abuse , New York State Psychiatric Institute , New York , NY 10024 , USA ( GB ) ; Department of Psychiatry , College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University , New York , NY , USA ( GB ) ; Department of Psychology , University at Albany , SUNY , Albany , NY , USA ( NTVD ) ; Department of Psychiatry , Mount Sinai School of Medicine , New York , NY , USA ( NTVD ) ; and School of Experimental Psychology , University of Bristol , Bristol , UK ( MM ) 1 Burrelli J .
