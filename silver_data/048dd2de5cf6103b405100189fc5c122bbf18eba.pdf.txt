The stromal cell - derived factor - 1 , SDF - 1 / CXCL12 , has previously been shown to promote axonal growth in the presence of potent chemorepellent molecules known to be important in nervous system development . Here , we report that treatment with SDF - 1 α is suf ﬁ cient to overcome neurite outgrowth inhibition mediated by CNS myelin towards cultured postnatal dorsal root ganglion neurons . While we found both cognate SDF - 1 receptors , CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 , to be coexpressed on myelin - sensitive dorsal root ganglion neurons , the distinct expression pattern of CXCR4 on growth cones and branching points of neurites suggests a function of this receptor in chemokine - mediated growth promotion and / or arborization . These in vitro ﬁ ndings were further corroborated as local intrathecal infusion of SDF - 1 into spinal cord injury following thoracic dorsal hemisection resulted in enhanced sprouting of corticospinal tract axons into white and grey matter . Our ﬁ ndings indicate that SDF - 1 receptor activation might constitute a novel therapeutic approach to promote axonal growth in the injured CNS . © 2008 Elsevier Inc . All rights reserved . Introduction Limited central nervous system ( CNS ) recovery ( Ramón y Cajal , 1928 ) has been ascribed to multiple factors such as the absence of neurotrophins ( Lu et al . , 2004 ; Blackmore and Letourneau , 2005 ) or the formation of a lesion scar acting as a regeneration barrier at the site of injury ( Stichel and Müller , 1998 ; Fawcett and Asher , 1999 ; Klapka and Müller , 2006 ) . Furthermore , myelin - associated inhibitors , MAIs , were shown to contribute to regenerative failure ( Schwab and Bartholdi , 1996 ; Fournier and Strittmatter , 2001 ; Filbin , 2003 ; Domeniconi et al . , 2005 ) . In postnatal mammalian CNS injury , Nogo - A ( Chen et al . , 2000 ; GrandPrè et al . , 2000 ) , myelin - associated glycoprotein ( MAG , McKerracher et al . , 1994 ; Tang et al . , 2001 ) , and oligodendrocyte - myelin glycoprotein ( OMgp , Wang et al . , 2002 ; Vourc ' h and Andres , 2004 ) , are ef ﬁ cient axonal outgrowth inhibitors . Interestingly , these molecules were described to abrogate axonal outgrowth upon interaction with a common tripartite receptor complex ( Fournier et al . , 2001 ; Filbin , 2003 ; Domeniconi et al . , 2005 ) in a manner which largely depends on neuronal age and origin ( McKerracher et al . , 1994 ; Mukhopadhyay et al . , 1994 ; DeBellard et al . , 1996 ; Ng and Lozano , 1999 ) . Recent studies documented that this impaired tolerance of inhibitory cues is related to the intrinsic state of the affected cells ( Song et al . , 1998 ; Ng and Lozano , 1999 ; Blackmore and Letourneau , 2005 ) . In dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons , an increased sensitivity towards the myelin - associated axon growth inhibitor MAG coincides with a molecular switch at postnatal day three / four ( P3 / P4 ) which is characterized by decreased intracellular cAMP levels ( DeBellard et al . , 1996 ; Cai et al . , 2001 ) . Cyclic AMP regulates numerous cellular processes through different signalling pathways ( Antoni , 2000 ) , and elevation of intracellular cAMP levels turned out to be a tool for increasing the regenerative capacity of neuronal cells ( Cai et al . , 1999 ; Neumann et al . , 2002 ; Qiu et al . , 2002 ) . One of the extrinsic factors which can promote cAMP - dependent alteration of axonal outgrowth behaviour was shown to be the chemokine SDF - 1 / CXCL12 . Recent studies on guidance cues in embryonic neural development revealed an improvement in neurite outgrowth in the presence of potent neurorepellent molecules such as semaphorin 3A and slit after application of this chemokine ( Chalasani et al . , 2003 , 2007 ) . The α - chemokine SDF - 1 is the only known ligand for CXCR4 , a coreceptor of T - tropic HIV - 1 strains ( Oberlin et al . , 1996 ; Nagasawa et al . , 1998 ) . While CXCR4 - and SDF - 1 - de ﬁ cient mice show similar developmental defects and die perinatally ( Nagasawa et al . , 1996 ; Ma et al . , 1998 ; Lu et al . , 2002 ) , SDF - 1 was recently shown to signal through an additional receptor , CXCR7 / RDC1 ( Balabanian et al . , 2005 ) . In this study , we analyzed the ability of SDF - 1 α to overcome CNS myelin - associated outgrowth inhibition of myelin - sensitive postnatal Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience 40 ( 2009 ) 293 – 300 ⁎ Corresponding author .

Furthermore , we identi ﬁ ed both SDF - 1 receptors on injured CSTaxons in spinal cord and observed signi ﬁ cantly enhanced axonal sprouting upon contin - uous local infusion of SDF - 1 α into the spinal cord lesion . Results SDF - 1 α abrogates impaired axon outgrowth on CNS myelin To test the neurite growth inhibitory effects of a CNS myelin preparation applied in this study , P6 DRG neurons were plated on substrates composed of either laminin or laminin plus myelin . After 24 h , neurons were immunostained for neuro ﬁ laments to visualize cell bodies and neurites and were screened for outgrowth perfor - mance . Quantitative analysis of neurite growth on culture substrates with or without myelin revealed a severe impairment of outgrowth in the presence of myelin . Neurite growth was signi ﬁ cantly decreased by approximately 80 % in comparison to DRG neurons on a myelin - free laminin substrate ( Figs . 1A , B , E ) . The outgrowth impairment of DRG neurons on myelin was not due to a reduction in cell adhesion , as the number of neurons attached to myelin - coated surfaces was even slightly increased as compared to the laminin control ( data not shown ) . To assess whether SDF - 1 α is able to reverse myelin - induced neurite outgrowth inhibition , this chemokine was applied to P6 DRG neurons at a concentration range of 50 – 500 ng / ml for 24 h . Quantitative analysis revealed that in the presence of SDF - 1 α up to 35 % more P6 DRG neurons developed three or more neurites on myelin - coated slides ( Figs . 1B , C ) . Outgrowth improvement was most prominent , although statistically not signi ﬁ cant , at a concentration of 500 ng / ml of SDF - 1 α ( data not shown ) . Conversely , DRG neurons grown on laminin alone displayed no marked effects following application of this chemokine . Preincubation with SDF - 1 signi ﬁ cantly enhances neurite outgrowth activity on myelin To test whether the growth - promoting effect of SDF - 1 α can be increased by a preincubation period prior to cell seeding , dissociated DRGs were incubated with SDF - 1 α at a ﬁ nal concentration of 50 – 500 ng / ml for 1 h and were then plated on a laminin or laminin plus myelin substrate . Following preincubation and plating , cells were cultivated in the presence of SDF - 1 α for additional 23 h , then ﬁ xed and stained for neuro ﬁ laments . Quantitative analysis demonstrated that cells pretreated with SDF - 1 α showed signi ﬁ cantly enhanced outgrowth on myelin with a doubling of the number of neurons displaying three or more neurites ( Figs . 1D , F ) , compared to control cultures lacking SDF - 1 α preincubation ( Fig . 1F ) . Neither preincubation alone nor cultivation of neurons in the presence of SDF - 1 α without pretreatment led to a signi ﬁ cant increase in the number of cells showing neurite outgrowth ( data not shown ) demonstrating that pretreatment was necessary , but not suf ﬁ cient , to induce signi ﬁ cantly enhanced neurite growth on a CNS myelin substrate . SDF - 1 receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 are coexpressed on cultured DRG neurons We have characterized the spatial and temporal distribution of the two known G protein - coupled receptors for SDF - 1 , CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 , on myelin - sensitive P6 DRG neurons by double - immuno ﬂ uorescence . Neurons were counterstained for neuro ﬁ la - ments to visualize cell bodies and neurites . Staining for CXCR4 Fig . 3 . CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 are coexpressed on cultured DRG neurons .

Arrowheads indicate CXCR4 - immunoreactivity at the tips and bases of outgrowing neurite stumps . After 24 h in vitro , CXCR7 / RDC1 - immunoreactivity is evenly distributed on CXCR4 - positive cell bodies and neurites in a granular pattern ( D – F ) . Pictures chosen for presentation are representative of at least three independent experiments ( n ≥ 3 ) . 295 J . Opatz et al . / Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience 40 ( 2009 ) 293 – 300 showed a strong expression of this receptor in nearly all of the DRG neurons after 24 h in vitro ( Figs . 2A – C ) . Immunocytochemical analysis at higher magni ﬁ cations revealed that CXCR4 - immunoreactivity was distributed in a characteristic patchy pattern ( Figs . 2C – E ) along neurites , where it was predominantly localized at branching points and at the growing tips of neurites . A patchy distribution of CXCR4 could also be observed on the outer surface of neuronal cell bodies ( Fig . 2C , arrow ) , as demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Figs . 2F – H , see also Supplementary movie 1 and 2 ) . CXCR4 - immunoreactivity gradually decreased during prolonged culture periods and was barely detectable on neuro ﬁ lament - positive neurites after 72 h while , at the same time , staining for CXCR4 remained strong on cell bodies , where it became more evenly distributed ( data not shown ) . A very similar staining pattern could be obtained using a second anti - CXCR4 antibody from a different provider ( data not shown ) . The second known receptor for SDF - 1 , CXCR7 / RDC1 , was expressed and evenly distributed on the cell surface of nearly all DRG neurons , both on neurites and cell bodies colocalizing , in part , with CXCR4 ( Figs . 3A – F ) . A region - speci ﬁ c distribution of CXCR4 - immunoreactiv - ity on neuronal cell bodies and on neurites could already be observed within 5 h in vitro , where it was preferentially localized to the tips of outgrowing neurite stumps as well as to sites where processes emerged ( Figs . 3A , C arrowheads ) . Conversely , CXCR7 / RDC1 was Fig . 4 . Quanti ﬁ cation of SDF - 1 α - induced axon sprouting of the lesioned dorsal corticospinal tract ( dCST ) following local intrathecal chemokine infusion .

Our ﬁ ndings demonstrate that both cognate receptors to SDF - 1 , CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 , are pres - ent on cultured P6 DRG neurons but appear in different distribution patterns . Intrathecal infusion of SDF - 1 α into lesioned rat spinal cord promotes sprouting of corticospinal tract axons To con ﬁ rm the neurite outgrowth promoting effects of SDF - 1 α in vivo , we applied this chemokine in a rat model of spinal cord injury . Animals underwent a dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord including the major part of the dorsal corticospinal tract ( dCST ) and subse - quently received an intrathecal infusion of either SDF - 1 α or PBS / BSA buffer over a period of 1 week . After 5 weeks , animals were sacri ﬁ ced , BDA - labelled CST axons were immunohistochemically visualized ( Fig . 4 , A – D ) and in each animal axon sprouting was analyzed by countingthe ﬁ berfragmentsinthewhiteandgreymatterof12coronal sectionstakenfromaregionbetween1 and20mmrostral tothelesion site ( Fig . 4E , largehorizontalbar ) .

In the buffer - infused control animals , BDA - labelling revealed only little sprouting of the dorsal CST in the grey ( 39 . 4±2 . 3 ﬁ bers / animal , Fig . 4G ) and white matter ( 22 . 7±1 . 4 ﬁ bers / animal , Fig . 4H ) , respec - tively . The densityof CST ﬁ bers was signi ﬁ cantlyhigher in the SDF - 1 α - treated rats , reaching 116 . 8±6 . 1 ﬁ bers / animal in grey ( Fig . 4G ) and 40 . 7±2 . 1 ﬁ bers / animal in white matter ( Fig . 4H ) regions , respectively . We further investigated whether the SDF - 1 α receptors were expressed in intact and lesioned spinal cord of rat . In both intact and lesioned spinal cord numerous BDA - traced CST axons showed immunoreactivity for CXCR4 ( Figs . 5A – D ) and CXCR7 / RDC1 ( data not shown ) . Confocal images revealed that both receptors were present along the axons but tended to be enriched in branching points or endbulb - like structures ( Figs . 5E – L ) . Triple - staining for BDA , CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 revealed that occasionally both receptors coloca - lized along the same axon fragment ( Figs . 5M – P ) . Immunostainings were con ﬁ rmed by using a second set of anti - CXCR4 or anti - CXCR7 / RDC1 antibodies from a different provider ( data not shown ) . Fig . 5 .

Opatz et al . / Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience 40 ( 2009 ) 293 – 300 Discussion Increasing the regenerative capacity of adult neuronal cells is a challenging aim of modern neurobiological research . Myelin proteins were reported to be among the major impediments to neuronal repair in the injured adult mammalian CNS ( Filbin , 2003 ; Schwab et al . , 2005 ) contributing to neurological de ﬁ cits which accompany spinal cord injury , presumably by acting through activation of a Rho - dependent pathway ( Domeniconi et al . , 2005 ; Alabed et al . , 2006 ; McKerracher and Higuchi , 2006 ) . In this study , we show that neurite outgrowth of postnatal DRG neurons is signi ﬁ cantly impaired on rat CNS myelin compared to laminin - only control substrate , and we demonstrate that the α - chemokine SDF - 1 is able to promote neurite outgrowth of myelin - sensitive neurons . Application of SDF - 1 α to postnatal DRG neurons resulted in an ef ﬁ cient abrogation of growth inhibition and led to improved neurite outgrowth in a dose - depen - dent manner . Our observations are in accordance with recent ﬁ ndings by Chalasani et al . ( 2003 , 2007 ) showing that SDF - 1 abolishes inhibitory effects of potent repulsive guidance molecules such as semaphorin 3A and C or slit - 2 on embryonic retinal ganglion cells . In our study , neurite growth - promoting effects of SDF - 1 α on inhibitory myelin were signi ﬁ cantly increased if cells underwent a preincubation phase in the presence of this chemokine prior to plating on myelin substrate . However , SDF - 1 α pretreatment of neurons revealed to be necessary , but not suf ﬁ cient , for neurite outgrowth on a CNS myelin substrate , as withdrawal of SDF - 1 α after pretreatment largely led to an abrogation of the growth supporting effects . Thus , pretreatment with SDF - 1 α mayact as a conditioning process which facilitates subsequent neurite outgrowth on myelin - coated surfaces . Similar priming effects have been reported for neurotrophins , cAMP or conditioning lesions ( Neumann and Woolf , 1999 ; Cai et al . , 1999 ; Neumann et al . , 2002 ) to improve regenerative capacities . Recent evidence suggests that SDF - 1 elevates intracellular cAMP levels through a CXCR4 - dependent pathway ( Chalasani et al . , 2003 ) . We have also characterized the expression and distribution of the G protein - coupled SDF - 1 receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 in myelin - sensitive DRG neurons . CXCR4 is prominently expressed on cultured P6 DRG neurons at early stages of cultivation and is localized to both cell bodies and neurites in a characteristic pattern with preferential appearance at branching points and growth cones . As these structures represent regions of directional growth , CXCR4 might affect neurite branching and / or neurite extension in these cells . Interestingly , a similar region - speci ﬁ c axonal distribution of CXCR4 - immunoreactiv - ity was described for hippocampal neurons ( Pujol et al . , 2004 ) . Until recently , CXCR4 was regarded as the only SDF - 1 receptor ( Lazarini et al . , 2003 ; Kucia et al . , 2004 ) . However , it could be shown that the former vasoactive intestinal peptide – receptor CXCR7 / RDC1 is activated bySDF - 1 ( Balabanianet al . , 2005 ) . Asneuronal localization of the CXCR7 / RDC1 receptor has not been described thus far , we characterized its spatial and temporal expression patterns on DRG neurons . CXCR7 / RDC1 is coexpressed with CXCR4 on P6 DRG neurons , where it could bemapped to cell bodies and neurites . In contrast tothe distinct localization of CXCR4 , CXCR7 / RDC1 is more evenly distributed and its expression remains prominent during the entire period ( 72 h ) of cultivation . SDF - 1 may thus activate two different receptors on DRG neurons and presumably affect multiple signalling pathways . Our invitro observationsontheneuritegrowthsupportingfunction of SDF - 1 α on inhibitory CNS myelin substrate were further corrobo - ratedby invivo studies ina model of traumaticspinal cord injuryin rat . Following local intrathecal infusion of SDF - 1 α into the lesion area , we observed extensive sprouting of transected CST axons into grey and white matter of the rostral stump . Conversely , in injured control animals lacking SDF - 1 α infusion axon sprouting was very limited . Both cognate receptors to SDF - 1 α , CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 , are expressed by numerous CST axons in intact and lesioned spinal cord . This is in line with the observations that these receptors are present at low constitutive levels in intact mature cortex neurons ( Schönemeier et al . , 2008 ) . The presence of CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 receptors in the injured spinal cord , as shown here , suggests direct interactions of SDF - 1 α with its neuronal receptors to promote axon sprouting . However , it should be noted that , besides direct interactions with neuronal SDF - 1 receptors , indirect axon growth - promoting mechanisms could be activated through binding of SDF - 1 α to receptor - bearing nonneuronal cells . Furthermore , at the current stage it cannot be excluded that in order to react with a regenerative sprouting response , axonal tips or branching points need to express both receptors , CXCR4 and CXCR7 / RDC1 . Determination of their individual functional roles awaits the generation of conditional knockout mutants for both receptor genes as well as viable receptor - de ﬁ cient double mutants . Taken together , we have characterized SDF - 1 α as a potent activator of in vitro as well as in vivo neurite regeneration and demonstrated its capacity to overcome CNS myelin - induced neurite outgrowth inhibi - tion of both postnatal PNS and adult CNS neurons . We were able to demonstrate coexpression of both receptor proteins in cultured rat DRG neurons as well as on sprouting CNS axons . Further experiments will be required in order to elucidate the complete pathway employed by SDF - 1 α to abrogate myelin - induced inhibition of axon growth . Experimental methods Animals Postnatal day 6 ( P6 ) Wistar rat pups were used for preparation of primary cells and adult Wistar rats ( 200 – 250 g ) were used for spinal cord injury . Animals were bred within the institutional animal facility under pathogen - free conditions and in temperature - and humidity - controlled housing . All experiments were conducted in compliance with the German Animal Protection Law . Preparation of DRG neurons DRG neurons were isolated from P6 Wistar rats according to DeBellard et al . ( 1996 ) . Brie ﬂ y , rats were anaesthetized and decapi - tated . DRGs ( Th8 - L6 ) were harvested , mechanically dissociated and incubated in 0 . 25 % trypsin / EDTA and 0 . 3 % collagenase type I in DMEM at 37 °C and 10 % CO 2 for 30 min . For each experiment , the DRGs of four animals were combined . Following dissociation , the cells were resuspended in DMEM medium ( Gibco ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( PAA ) , nerve growth factor - 2 . 5S ( 10 ng / ml , Sigma ) , glutamine ( 20 mM , Gibco ) penicillin / streptomycin ( 500 U / ml ; Gibco ) and 5 ′ - ﬂ uoro - 2 ′ - desoxyuridine , 5 ′ dFUrd ( 100 nM , Sigma ) . Preparation of myelin from adult rat brain Myelin was prepared from brains of adult female Wistar rats as previously described ( Cai et al . , 2002 ) . Brie ﬂ y , whole brains were collected and frozen at − 20 °C . The brain stem was harvested and myelin was prepared by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose step gradient . Following determination of total protein amount ( Biorad ) using bovine serum albumin ( fraction IV ; Sigma ) as a standard , the myelin preparation was diluted to a ﬁ nal protein concentration of 10 μ g / ml in 10 mM HEPES buffer ( pH 7 . 15 ) . Immunocytochemistry Cultured P6 DRG neurons were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) at room temperature for 10 min and preincubated in normal goat serum at a ﬁ nal concentration of 3 % in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . Samples were stained with the following primary antibodies at 4 °C over night : rabbit polyclonal antibody NA 1297 directed against the NF - L , NF - M , and NF - H forms of neuro ﬁ lament ( 1 : 2000 , Biotrend ) , 298 J . Opatz et al . / Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience 40 ( 2009 ) 293 – 300 mouse monoclonal antibody MAB170 to CXCR4 ( 12G5 clone ; 1 : 100 , R & D Systems ) , rabbit polyclonal antibody BP2211 to CXCR4 ( 1 : 100 ; Acris ) , rabbit polyclonal antibody IMG - 71142 to CXCR7 / RDC1 ( 1 : 100 , Imgenex ) , and isotype control antibody 550339 to mouse monoclonal IgG 2A ( 1 : 50 , BD Biosciences ) . For detection of primary antibodies , samples were stained with Biotin - , Alexa 594 - or Alexa 488 - ( 1 : 500 , MoBiTec ) conjugated anti - mouse or anti - rabbit secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h and ﬁ nally mounted in Fluoromount - G ( SouthernBiotech ) . For staining of neuro ﬁ laments , Triton was applied at a ﬁ nal concentration of 0 . 05 % in PBS . Picture acquisition on a Nikon Eclipse TE 200 microscope and data analysis were performed using the Lucia software ( Nikon ) . Neurite outgrowth assay For the neurite outgrowth assay , 8 - well Permanox labtek chamber slides ( NalgeNunc ) werecoatedwithpoly - D - lysine ( 1mg / ml , Sigma ) at room temperature for 1 h and subsequently with laminin ( 1 μ g / ml , Sigma ) at 37 °C for 1 h . For myelin coating , myelin preparation from adult rat brainwas left to dry on poly - D - lysine / laminin coated slides at room temperature over night at a ﬁ nal concentration of 2 μ g of total protein / well . After washing the coated slides once with PBS , the cells were seeded at a ﬁ nal density of 5×10 4 cells / well and incubated in DMEM medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , nerve growth factor - 2 . 5S ( 10 ng / ml , Sigma ) , penicillin / streptomycin ( 500 U / ml , Gibco ) , and 5 ′ - ﬂ uoro - 2 ′ - desoxyuridine ( 100 nM , Sigma ) . Cells were left to grow under different conditions at 37 °C and 10 % CO 2 for up to 24 h , ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA and then stained for neuro ﬁ laments . For quantitativeanalysis , ninepicturesweretakenrandomlyperwellat4× magni ﬁ cation and the number of neurons showing neurite outgrowth as well as the total number of neurons were determined . We de ﬁ ned neurite growing neurons as neuro ﬁ lament - positive cells showing three or more neurites each with a length of at least the cell body diameter ( Ng and Lozano , 1999 ; Qiu et al . , 2005 ) . In stimulation experiments , cells were incubated with SDF - 1 α ( 350 - NS , R & D Systems ) at a ﬁ nal concentration of 50 – 500 ng / ml . SDF - 1 α was applied in a preincubation stepat 37 °C and 10 % CO 2 for 1 h prior to cell plating . Spinal cord surgery and infusion of SDF - 1 α Spinal cord surgery in adult female Wistar rats ( 200 – 250 g ) , which included transection of the dorsal corticospinal tract ( CST ) , was performed as described previously ( Hermanns et al . , 2001 ) . The dura was opened at the thoracic level 8 ( Th8 ) , and the dorsal CSTand dorsal columns were transected using a Scouten wire knife ( Bilaney , Germany ) . Following surgery , the dura was sutured . After ﬁ lling the catheter , a small hole was made into the dura at a distance of 5 mm caudal to the lesion . The silicon tube catheter was inserted into the subarachnoid space and directed towards the side of injury . The catheter was connected to an osmotic minipump ( Alzet ) loaded with 200 μ l of either SDF - 1 α ( 10 μ M in PBS / BSA ; R & D Systems ) or PBS / BSA buffer . Following ﬁ xation of catheter and minipump , the overlying tissue was sutured , and the animals were allowed to recover . Application of either SDF - 1 α or PBS buffer was carried out at a ﬂ ow rate of 1 μ l / h over a time period of 7 days . One week after lesion , the pump was removed in a second surgery . Anterograde CST axon tracing and immunohistochemistry Three weeks before sacri ﬁ ce , all rats received CST axon tracing as described previously ( Klapka et al . , 2005 ) . A total volume of 3 . 2 μ l biotinylated dextrane amine ( BDA , 10 % , Molecular Probes ) was stereotactically injected into both hemispheres of the sensorimotor cortex . After ﬁ ve weeks , the rodents underwent injection of a lethal dose of hypnorm / dormicum and were then transcardially perfused with 4 % PFA ( Merck ) . The spinal cord was removed , post ﬁ xed in 4 % PFA , and cryoprotected in sucrose ( 30 % , Sigma ) for 3 – 5 days . Spinal cord samples were serially sectioned in a coronal plane in 50 μ m thick slices using a freezing microtome . Immunostaining of spinal cord slices for BDA was performed as described previously ( Klapka et al . , 2005 ) . Brie ﬂ y , free ﬂ oating sections were washed in PBS followed by incubation with an avidin – biotin - peroxidase complex ( ABC , Vector Laboratories ) at 4 °C over night . The next day , tissue was washed in PBS and reacted in 0 . 015 % DAB for 1 min . A brown staining reaction was obtained by adding 0 . 004 % H 2 O 2 to the DAB solution , and the staining process was stopped by washing with PBS buffer . The sections were mounted onto slides and embedded in DPX ( Fluka ) . Images were captured with a Keyence BZ - 8100E microscope . For detection of receptor expression in vivo , 50 μ m free - ﬂ oating cryostat coronal spinal cord sections were preincubated in 5 % donkey serum and 0 . 1 % Triton - X - 100 in PBS for 1 h at RT . Samples were stained with the following primary antibodies in 3 % donkey serum and 0 . 1 % Triton - X - 100 in PBS at 4 °C over night : rabbit polyclonal antibody sc - 6190 directed against CXCR4 , ( 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz ) , mouse monoclonal antibody MAB170 to CXCR4 ( 12G5 clone ; 1 : 100 , R & D Systems ) , rabbit polyclonal antibody ab12870 to CXCR7 / RDC1 ( 1 : 100 ; Abcam ) and mouse monoclonal antibody MAB4227 to CXCR7 / RDC1 ( 1 : 100 ; R & D Systems ) . For detection of primary antibodies , samples were stained with Alexa 594 - or Alexa 488 - ( 1 : 300 , MoBiTec ) conjugated anti - mouse or anti - rabbit secondary antibodies , respec - tively , and for triple staining BDA was stained with streptavidin - conjugated Alexa 350 ( Invitrogen ) at room temperature for 2 h and ﬁ nally mounted in Fluoromount - G ( SouthernBiotech ) .
