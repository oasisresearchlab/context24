Northern blot analysis and plaque hybridization experiments showed that the LMP131A mRNA is present at ca . 0 . 3 ~ o of the mRNA in mature pollen and is not detectable in carpel , petal , floral bud , leaf , or root . The clone contains an open reading frame of 139 amino acid residues which shows greater than 40 ~ o sequence identity in a 91 amino acid overlap to animal actin - depolymerizing factors ( ADF ) , cofilin and destrin . The sequences at and near the actin - binding site are most conserved . Using the lily clone as a probe , a cDNA clone , BMP1 , was isolated from a mature anther library of Brassica napus . The expression pattern of the BMP1 clone was the same as that of the lily clone . The Brassica anther - preferential clone contains an open reading frame which is 79 ~ o identical to the lily LMP131A protein . Southern blot analysis showed that there are one or a few copies of the putative ADF genes in B . napus and Arabidopsis thaliana . Introduction Male reproductive processes in flowering plants occur in the anther which is composed of several tissue and cell types . In early developmental stages , the sporogenous tissue within the anther produces pollen mother cells which generate a tetrad ofmicrospores by meiosis . The microspore gradually develops into the male gametophyte which is composed of a vegetative cell and two sperm cells . The role of the male gametophyte is to produce and transport the sperm cells for dou - ble fertilization . One sperm fertilizes the egg and the second sperm fuses with two previously fused nuclei of the central cell . This results in the for - mation of the zygote and primary endosperm cell , respectively . It was estimated that mature pollen of maize expresses about 24 000 different mRNAs [ 37 ] . Approximately 35 ~ o of these pollen - expressed mRNAs are very abundant and comprise about 240 sequences . Recently , pollen - or anther - The nucleotide sequence data reported will appear in the EMBL , GenBank and DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Databases under the accession numbers Z14109 ( LMP131A ) and Z14110 ( BMP1 ) . 40 expressed genes have been isolated from a vari - ety of plant species . Several anther - expressed genes have been studied in tomato . An LAT52 clone from tomato is expressed in pollen , anthers and at 20 - to 50 - fold lower levels in petals [ 35 ] . The LAT52 clone codes for a putative protein of 17 . 8 kDa which shows 32 ~ o identity to the pro - tein sequence of the maize clone , Zmcl3 [ 14 ] . Both gene products have some sequence homol - ogy to trypsin inhibitors [ 20 ] . LAT56 and LAT59 , which are preferentially expressed in tomato an - ther , have a significant homology to pectate lyases from the plant pathogen Erwinia [ 38 ] . A pollen - specific cDNA from maize , Zmc58 , and the major ragweed pollen allergen , AmbaI , also have strik - ing sequence homology to the LAT59 and LAT56 proteins [ 18 , 27 ] . Three pollen - preferential gene families from B . napus have been isolated and characterized [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] . One of the clones , Bp4 , is expressed during the early stages of microspore development . Two other pollen - expressed genes in B . napus , Bpl0 and Bpl9 , start to express in uninucleate microspores and the mRNA level is increased during development , reaching a peak in the late stage but declining considerably in mature pollen . Bpl9 codes for proteins putatively iden - tiffed as pectin esterases which may be involved in pollen wall reorganization . The Bp 10 gene fam - ily codes for proteins of 62 kDa showing approx - imately 30 ~ o sequence identity to cucumber and pumpkin ascorbate oxidase . Putative ascorbate oxidase genes which are preferentially expressed in pollen have also been identified from tomato and tobacco [ 36 ] . It was shown that one of the Arabidopsis ~ - tubulin genes is expressed prefer - entially in mature pollen [ 11 , 16 ] . A family of pollen - specific genes which produces polygalac - turonase was isolated from Oenothera organensis [ 9 ] and maize [ 24 ] . Many allergenic proteins of pollen are responsible for IgE binding in pollen - allergic patients [ 17 ] . A cDNA clone , BetvI , from the pollen cDNA library of white birch has been isolated by immunoscreening using the serum of a birch pollen allergic patient [ 8 ] . The deduced amino acid sequence of BetvI has shown 55 ~ o sequence identity with a pea disease resistance response gene . A similar approach has been used to clone several pollen - specific allergen cDNAs from Kentucky bluegrass [ 32 ] and rye - grass [ 13 , 33 ] . In this study , we report the isolation of cDNA clones from lily ( Lilium longiflorum Thunb . cv . Nellie White ) and rapeseed ( B . napus ) which are preferentially expressed in mature anther . The protein encoded for by the clones is significantly homologous to animal actin - depolymerizing fac - tor ( ADF ) . It has been suggested that destrin , a member of the animal ADF family , is capable of directly interacting with F - actin , thereby cutting and depolymerizing the F - actin [ 25 ] . The action of destrin is insensitive to pH whereas cofilin binds to F - actin at near neutral pH . Cofilin is capable of reversibly controlling actin depolymer - ization and polymerization in response to various stimuli . Cofilin molecules are almost completely translocated into nuclei in mammalian cells ex - posed to heat shock or 10 ~ o dimethyl sulfoxide [ 26 ] . Both destrin and cofilin cDNA clones have been isolated from mammals [ 1 , 2 , 19 , 22 ] . How - ever , there is little information on plant ADF . Materials and methods Plant materials Pollen from Easter lily harvested from commer - cial bulb fields and kept at - 20°C was kindly provided by Dr Frank A . Loewus . For Northern analysis , lily plants were grown to the flowering stage under greenhouse conditions . Field - grown rapeseed ( B . napus ) at the flowering stage was used for library construction and northern anal - ysis . cDNA library construction and molecular charac - terization cDNA libraries were constructed using the 2 ZaplI vector ( Stratagene ) and poly ( A ) + mRNA isolated from various organs . An adapter con - taining Eco RI and Not I sites ( Pharmacia LKB ) was used to ligate the 2 vector and cDNA . The libraries were divided into 5 to 20 sublibraries and amplified in an E . co6 host strain , XL - 1 Blue [ F ' : : Tnl0 proA + B + , laclq , ( lacZ ) M15 / recA1 , endA1 , gyrA96 ( Nalr ) , thi , hsdR17 ( rk - mk _ + ) , supE44 , relA1 , lac ] ( Stratagene ) . Plaque hybrid - ization was performed with 105 plaques which were lifted onto nitrocellulose membranes . The plasmid pBluescript containing cDNA clones was in vivo rescued from the bacteriophage 2 using fl helper phage , R408 ( Stratagene ) . Both strands of the cDNA inserts were sequenced by the dideox - ynucleotide chain termination method using double - stranded DNA as a template [ 29 ] . The GCG programs ( Genetics Computer Group ) were used for sequence analysis . Southern and northem blot analyses were performed as de - scribed by Sambrook et al . [ 28 ] . Results Isolation of an anther - preferential clone from lily cDNA library A clone LMP131A , which is expressed in mature pollen but not in leaf , was isolated from a lily pollen cDNA library by differential hybridization . Fig . 1 . Expression level of LMP131A and BMP1 . A . North - ern blot analysis of LMP131A . Ten / ~ g of total RNA prepared from mature anther ( A ) , carpel ( C ) , petal ( P ) , floral bud ( B ) , root ( R ) , or leaf ( L ) was hybridized with the radioactively labeled LMP 131A probe . B . Northern blot analysis of BMP 1 . Two # g of mRNA prepared from anther ( A ) , carpel ( C ) , petal ( P ) , leaf ( L ) , or root ( R ) was hybridized with the BMP 1 probe . The numbers are the RNA size marker ( BRL ) in kb . 41 Northern blot analysis showed that a mRNA of ca . 0 . 7 kb , present in mature anther , hybridized with the LMP131A probe ( Fig . 1A ) . No detect - able level of the LMP131A mRNA was present in carpel , petal , root , or leaf of lily at the flower - ing stage . Young flower buds also did not show any expression of the mRNA . Therefore , it ap - pears that the LMP131A is preferentially ex - pressed in mature anther . The expression level of the LMP131A clone was estimated indirectly by measuring the frequency of this cDNA clone in 105 plaques of the pollen library as well as other cDNA libraries made from carpel , leaf , or root . This experiment showed that the LMP 131A clone is present at about a frequency of 0 . 3 ~ o of the lily pollen library and that the clone is not present in other libraries . Characterization of LMP131A clone Since the LMP131A clone is preferentially ex - pressed in mature anther and the expression level is high , the protein encoded by the LMP131A clone may play a major role in anther . In order to facilitate characterization of the cDNA clone , the pBluescript vector containing the LMP131A insert was in vivo excised from the 2 ZaplI vec - tor . DNA sequencing of the clone revealed that it contains a 544 nucleotide sequence with one open reading frame coding for 139 amino acid residues ( Fig . 2 ) . Homology search to the Swis - sprotein database with the LMP131A sequence revealed that a family of ADF proteins is the most homologous to the LMP131A ( Fig . 3 ) . The human cofilin is 42 . 9 ~ o identical to the lily LMP131A at amino acid residues 34 - 123 . The most conserved area between the animal ADFs and LMP131A is the putative actin binding site [ 12 ] at amino acid residues 108 - 118 and the sur - rounding region ( Fig . 2 ) . Isolation and characterization of a B . napus cDNA clone homologous to LMP131A To study whether the LMP131A protein is also present in dicot species , we screened a cDNA 42 1 GGAACAAACAACATGGCGAACTCATCGTCCGGAATGGCGGTGGACGATGAATGCAAGCT C M A N S S S G M A V D D E C K L 16 61 AAGTT CATGGAGCTGAAGGCGAAGCGGAACTTCCGGTTCATCGTTTTCAAGATTGAGGAG K F M E L K A K R N F R F I V F K I E E 36 121 AAGGTGCAGCAGGTGACAGTGGAGCGGCTCGGGCAGCCGAATGAGAGCTACGATGATTT C K V Q Q V T V E R L G Q P N E S Y D D F 56 181 ACTGAGTGCCTCCCTCCTAATGAGTGCCGCTATGCTGTTTTCGATTTCGACTTTGT CACT T E C L P P N E C R Y A V F D F D F V T 76 24 i GATGAGAACTGTCAGAAGAGCAAGATCTTCTTCATCTCCTGGTCTCCTGACACATCAAGG D E N C Q K S K I F F I S W S P D T S R 96 301 GTGAGGAGTAAGATGCTATATGCTAGTACCAAGGATAGATTCAAGAGAGAGCTTGATGGG V R S K M L Y A S T K D R F K R E L D G 116 361 ATTCAAGTTGAATTGCAAGCAACAGATCCAAGCGAGATGAGCATGGATATTATAAAAGCA I Q V E L Q A T D P S E M S M D I I K A 136 421 AGAGCTTTCTGAAGCATTGGTTGTTCACCCTTCACTTCGAGCTTTCTTTGATTAAATTGT R A F 139 481 TTCTGTTGACCTTTGTCCTTCATTCATCTTGGTGTGATTAGTTCTAAACTATGTAAAAAT 541 GATT Fig . 2 .

The A . thaliana blot was washed at a low strin - gency condition . The bacteriophage 2 DNA digested with Hin - d III was used as a size marker ( center ) . cating that this clone is partial . The amino acid sequence at the putative actin binding site is iden - tical between these two proteins , supporting the hypothesis that they are actin binding proteins . Northern blot analysis showed that the BMP1 mRNA is present only in mature anther but not in carpel , leaf , or root ( Fig . 1B ) . Southern blot analysis showed that there is one or a few copies of the putative ADF genes in B . napus and A . thaliana ( Fig . 5 ) . Discussion In this article , we report isolation of a lily cDNA clone , LMP131A , which is highly expressed in mature anther . The plaque hybridization experi - ment showed that the LMP 131A clone is present at a frequency of 0 . 3 % in the mature pollen li - brary . Although this is an indirect way of mea - suring the level of gene expression , the result is probably similar to the actual level of gene ex - pression since the northern blot analysis showed a strongly hybridizing band . The initial size of the lily cDNA libraries was 10 7 to 10 8 pfu which should be large enough to cover the entire mRNA 44 population present in pollen . To avoid any arti - fact due to uneven amplification of the libraries , we have divided the primarily packaged phage into 20 sublibraries and maintained them inde - pendently . Plaque hybridization to different sub - libraries showed a similar frequency , indicating that there is no major difference in the frequency of the LMP131A clone . Northern blot analysis indicated that the LMP131A clone and BMP1 clone are expressed in mature anther but not in other organs examined . Since we have not tested every organ and tissue at different growth stages , it cannot be definitely stated that these clones are anther - or pollen - specific . In situ localization ex - periments are currently in progress to further study the expression pattern of these genes . The LMP131A clone encodes a 139 amino acid protein which shows a significant sequence ho - mology to animal ADFs . The most conserved region between animal ADFs and the LMP131A protein is the sequence at and near the putative actin - binding site [ 12 ] . Actin is the most abun - dant protein in many eukaryotic cells , often con - stituting 5 ~ o or more of the total cell protein . Actin filaments form a dense network which gives mechanical strength to the surface of the cells and enables the cells to change shape . The dynamic equilibrium existing between unpolymerized actin molecules and actin filaments drives many cell surface movements [ 10 ] . Actin gene families have been characterized from various plant species , including soybean [ 30 , 31 ] , maize [ 31 ] , A . thaliana [ 23 ] , petunia [ 6 ] , tomato [ 7 ] , carrot [ 34 ] , and rice [ 21 ] . It was suggested that various members of the actin genes from soybean and rice are dif - ferentially expressed [ 15 , 21 ] . However , it is un - known whether any of these actin genes are pref - erentially expressed in anther . The finding that the anther - preferential clone , LMP131A , codes for a putative ADF suggests that the equilibrium be - tween actin filament formation and depolymer - ization plays an important role in anther . How - ever , it will be necessary to prove that the LMP131A protein is indeed ADF . Southern blot analysis showed that the gene is a member of a small gene family in B . napus and A . thaliana . Whether other members are also ex - pressed primarily in anther or whether they are present in different tissues is unknown . Isolation of an anther - preferential cDNA clone from B . napus which has a significant homology to the lily clone shows that the putative ADF gene is present in both monocots and dicots and suggests that the gene product plays an important function in anther .
