Magazine R754 Correspondence Listeria monocy - togenes rotates around its long axis during actin - based motility Jennifer R . Robbins 1 , 3 and Julie A . Theriot 1 , 2 Actin - based motility of the Gram - positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is an analog of eukaryotic cell motility and has long been the subject of biochemical and biophysical investigations ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . Only one bacterial factor—ActA—is required for the movement of L . monocytogenes [ 2 – 4 ] . Biophysical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the conversion of actin polymerization into propulsive force [ 5 – 11 ] , but none predicts a torsional force . Surprisingly , we find that L . monocytogenes rotates around its long axis as it is propelled by actin polymerization . In contrast , Gram - negative bacteria do not rotate if actin - based motility is directed by IcsA ( VirG ) , a Shigella flexneri protein unrelated to ActA [ 3 , 12 , 13 ] . Through the non - specific coupling of fluorescent microspheres to the bacterial surface we observed the longitudinal rotation of L . monocytogenes moving in extract ( Figure 1A ; supplementary data ) . While beads remained at a fixed distance from the bacterial poles , indicating that they are not mobile on the cell surface , they changed their position with respect to the bacterial long axis . Bacterial speed averaged 0 . 09 µm / s ( S . D . = 0 . 03 µm / s ) , and neither speed nor path curvature was affected by bead attachment ( by Student’s T - test , p > 0 . 05 , n > 15 ) . After plotting the length of the bead’s orthogonal projection onto the longitudinal axis ( Figure 1B , C ) , we found that all traces indicated unidirectional rotation . The length of the orthogonal projection reached a maximum , crossed the bacterial longitudinal axis , reached a minimum and returned to a maximum as the bead crossed to the opposite side ( n = 40 , Figure 1C ) . Immotile bacteria symmetrically surrounded by actin jittered randomly . The periodicity of rotation was calculated by computing the autocorrelation functions of the orthogonal projections ( Figure 1D ) . Two such calculations were performed on every trajectory for which at least 500 s of data were available ( n = 27 ) , one with respect to time and the other with respect to forward distance traveled by the bacterium ( translational distance ) . A Fourier transformation of the autocorrelation ( Figure 1E ) showed a single peak in distance and time for all but one bacterium , indicating that each bacterium had a nearly constant rotation speed . Rotation was slow compared to forward motion . The average distance a bacterium travelled per rotation was 29 . 4 ± 11 . 8 µm ( n = 20 ) and the average time per rotation was 507 ± 160 s ( n = 19 ) . Neither the temporal nor the spatial period for rotation was well - correlated with bacterial speed or bacterial length , and the temporal and spatial periods did not correlate with each other ( supplemental data ) . Electron microscopy has shown that the filaments in actin tails are strikingly twisted [ 14 ] , and several experiments indicate that at least a subset of these filaments is attached to the bacterium [ 8 , 15 ] .

Two candidates for tethering actin filaments to ActA are the Arp2 / 3 complex and members of the Ena / VASP family [ 16 , 17 ] . It has been suggested that Ena / VASP proteins remain attached to the growing ends of actin filaments . Via cycles of dissociation and reassociation with filaments , they would act as a sliding clamp while remaining tightly bound to ActA [ 10 , 18 ] . We attached beads to the L . monocytogenes strain DP - L2823 , which expresses an ActA variant without Ena / VASP binding regions [ 19 ] . This strain exhibits defects in initiation and speed of movement [ 19 ] , but we captured a few individuals moving while attached to beads . These cells also rotated and their rotational period with respect to forward distance was statistically similar to that of wild - type L . monocytogenes . However , they took significantly longer to complete a single period of rotation ( rank - sum test , n = 6 ) and their average translational speed was 2 - fold slower than wild type ( 0 . 05 µm / s , S . D . = 0 . 02 , n = 12 ) . This demonstrates that Ena / VASP sliding clamp activity is not necessary for torque and suggests that the key actin – ActA attachment is more likely to be made by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 20 , 21 ] . To test whether rotation is a general feature of actin - based bacterial motility , we performed similar experiments on two Gram - negative bacteria ( Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Escherichia coli ) that express IcsA ( VirG ) , a protein necessary and sufficient for the actin - based motility of S . flexneri [ 12 , 13 ] . These bacteria moved in undiluted extract with an average speed of 0 . 10 µm / s ( S . D . = 0 . 06 , n = 24 ) and 0 . 21 µm / s ( S . D . = 0 . 08 , n = 14 ) , respectively . Almost no movement of the beads was observed ( Figure 2 , n = 24 for Y . pseudotuberculosis and n = 14 for E . coli ) . When occasionally a bead inverted position , it always coincided with a sharp bacterial turn , indicating that the bacterium had flipped over ( Figure2 ) . Autocorrelation analysis of these bead paths confirmed that no regular periodic rotation was occurring . In conclusion , we find that during actin - based motility the Gram - positive bacterium L . monocytogenes rotates longitudinally , a behavior not predicted by any current model for force generation by actin polymerization . By contrast , Gram - negative bacteria do not rotate . This might be due to biochemical differences between ActA and IcsA . Unlike ActA , IcsA recruits both Arp2 / 3 and Ena / VASP through binding to N - WASP [ 22 ] . Alternatively , differences in bacterial surface structure may be responsible . In L . monocytogenes , ActA is anchored in the cross - linked peptidoglycan cell wall and therefore thought to be immobile . In contrast , IcsA is free to diffuse laterally in the fluid outer membrane of Gram - negative species [ 23 , 24 ] . Here , the lack of rotation of the Gram - negative bacteria is consistent with the idea that the twisting of tethered actin filaments is responsible for longitudinal rotation of L . monocytogenes ; on the Gram - negative surface , torsion would be dissipated by rotational diffusion of IcsA in the outer membrane .

E - mail : theriot @ stanford . edu Primer Cell migration Rick Horwitz and Donna Webb Directed cell migration is an integrated process that is essential for embryonic development and throughout life ( Figure 1 ) . The failure of cells to migrate or the migration of cells to inappropriate locations can result in abnorm - alities or have life - threatening consequences . For example , many congenital defects in brain development leading to mental disorders can be attributed to defects in neuronal migration . In the adult , cell migration is central to homeostatic processes , such as mounting an effective immune response and the repair of injured tissues . Migration can also contribute to some pathological processes , including vascular disease , chronic inflammatory diseases , and tumor formation and metastasis . Thus , there is consider - able interest in understanding cell migration on a molecular level because this could lead to novel therapeutic approaches , especially in areas of biotechnology that focus on cellular transplantation and the manufacture of artificial tissues . While the emphasis in this article is on cell migration in vertebrates , migration is equally important in invertebrates , plants and some single - cell organisms . Understanding migration presents a formidable intellectual challenge because it is the product of several complex , integrated processes that must be carefully regulated . Conceptually , the migrating cell is best viewed as a highly polarized entity with rapidly changing activities that are spatially segregated , particularly at the cell front and rear . For efficient migration to occur , these activities need to be coordinated . Therefore , the challenge is to elucidate the mechanisms of the component processes , their regulation , and the nature of their integration . Due to the difficult nature of this problem , some components of migration will require multidisciplinary approaches and concepts .
