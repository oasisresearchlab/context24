Tillman To my family and friends Supervisor : Professor Johan Dabrosin Söderholm Linköping University Co - Supervisor I : PhD Åsa Keita Linköping University Co - Supervisor II : Professor Karl - Eric Magnusson Linköping University Opponent : Björn Weström Lund University I ABSTRACT The intestinal mucosa is the largest contact area and one of the most important barriers to the outside environment . It is highly specialized in aiding us digest and absorb nutrients . It is daily exposed to several potentially dangerous substances and microorganisms , which if they were allowed to pass into the body , could give rise to diseases . Throughout the small intestine certain sites specialized in antigen sampling are found . These sites are named Pey - er’s patches and are lymphoid follicles . The epithelium covering the Peyer’s patches is called follicle - associated epithelium and is specialized in antigen sampling and uptake . The special epithelium enables presentation of luminal antigen to immune cells in the underlying folli - cle . Persistent life stress and stressful life events affect the course of irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) and inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) through largely unknown mechanisms . Regula - tion of epithelial permeability to antigens is crucial for the balance between inflammation and immune - surveillance , and increased intestinal permeability has been shown in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease . Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) and corti - cotropin - releasing factor have been implicated as important mediators of stress - induced abnormalities in intestinal mucosal functions in animal models . Both of these mediators have been reported to regulate bowel ion secretion in humans during stress and uptake of horseradish peroxidase in rodents . Probiotics have been shown to ameliorate the deleteri - ous effects of stress on intestinal function , but mechanisms remain to be elucidated . The aim of this thesis was to elucidate whether mast cells play an important role in intesti - nal barrier function during stress and inflammation . Moreover , we wanted to determine whether probiotics can ameliorate the mucosal barrier integrity during stress and inflamma - tion . To study the function of mast cells we conducted in vitro experiments on cell lines and ex vivo experiments in Ussing chambers on mouse , rat and human intestinal tissue . The Ussing chamber technique measures electrophysiological properties of the tissue and also gives the possibility to study transcellular and paracellular passage of markers and bacteria . Immuno - histology and confocal microscopy have been used to identify mast cells and receptors of interest . Our results show that stress affects the follicle - associated epithelium barrier by mechanisms involving VIP and mast cells . These findings were corroborated by the localization of VIP receptors on mucosal mast cells . Furthermore , pretreatment with probiotics was effective in protecting the gut against stress - induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and mucosal inflam - mation . This protection appeared to involve a mast cell and peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - γ dependent mechanism . II POPULÄRVETENSKAPLIG SAMMANFATTNING Tarmslemhinnan fungerar som en barriär som hindrar skadliga bakterier och ämnen från att ta sig in i kroppen samtidigt som den släpper igenom eller aktivt tar upp näringsämnen och vätska . Små områden i tarmen är täckta av det så kallade follikelassocierade epitelet . Detta epitel är specialiserat på att fånga upp och släppa igenom partiklar i tarminnehållet och transportera det till underliggande immunvävnad . Denna funktion är viktig för kroppen då den förbereder immunförsvaret på vad det ska vara berett på att bekämpa . Inflammatorisk tarmsjukdom är ett samlingsbegrepp som innefattar sjukdomarna Crohns sjukdom och ulcerös kolit . Sjukdomarna karaktäriseras av en kronisk inflammation i tarmens slemhinna med symptom som lös avföring med blod och slem , buksmärtor , samt ibland viktnedgång , feber samt nedsatt allmäntillstånd . I Sverige är förekomsten av inflammatorisk tarmsjukdom relativt hög och uppskattas till 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 % av befolkningen . Orsaken till sjuk - domarna är okänd men både arv och miljö är av betydelse . Vid Crohns sjukdom tror man att något går fel vid det follikelassocierade epitelet , vilket leder till ett kraftigt ökat immunsvar som syns på tarmväggen och att det bildas mikroskopiska sår och lätt synliga skador . Det är sedan tidigare känt att stress påverkar patienter med inflammatorisk tarmsjukdom negativt och att det kan bidra till att patienterna får nya skov . Flera olika signalmolekyler har studerats för att belysa kopplingen mellan stress och immunförsvaret . En sådan signalmole - kyl är vasoaktiv intestinal peptid ( VIP ) . Den utsöndras från nerver och skulle kunna spela en nyckelroll i kopplingen mellan nervsystemet och immunförsvaret . Mastcellen är en speciell typ av immuncell i det ospecifika immunförsvararet . Den kan utsöndra inflammatoriska sub - stanser och därmed reglera hur starkt det inflammatoriska svaret blir vid en infektion . Mast - celler kan också tänkas reglera tarmslemhinnans svar på stress . Hos patienter med Crohns sjukdom har analyser utav tarminnehållet visat en minskad mängd av vissa bakterier . Några utav dessa bakterier har visat sig kunna dämpa kroppens inflammatoriska svar på inkräktande bakterier . Då bakterierna har antiinflammatoriska egenskaper är det intressant att studera huruvida behandling med probiotiska ”snälla” bak - terier har en potential att minska symptomen vid inflammatorisk tarmsjukdom . Det övergripande syftet med avhandlingen var att studera hur mastcellen reglerar tarmens barriärfunktion vid stress och om regleringen kan påverkas av probiotiska bakterier . Inledningsvis studerades effekterna av psykologisk stress på råtta . Stressade råttor uppvi - sade en ökad genomsläpplighet över tarmslemhinna jämfört med kontrolldjur . Den ökade genomsläppligheten kunde minskas genom att blockera effekten av VIP eller genom att hindra mastceller från att utsöndra sina signalmolekyler . Samma resultat kunde ses i operat - III ionsvävnad från människa och i cellodling där vi tillsatt VIP för att efterlikna utsöndringen som sker i kroppen under stress . I en musmodell med tjocktarmsinflammation studerades vidare effekten av en specifik pro - biotisk bakterie , som heter Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ( FP ) . Möss som behandlades med bakterien blev mindre sjuka och återhämtade sig snabbare än de som inte fick bakterien . Fortsättningsvis mättes effekten av en blandning probiotiska bakterier på tarmslemhinnans genomsläpplighet efter stress . Den probiotiska bakterieblandningen minskade genomsläpp - ligheten i normala råttors tarm men hade ingen effekt i tarm från djur som var genetiskt modifierade att sakna mastceller . Den positiva effekten som bakterierna hade på normala råttor kunde dessutom förhindras genom att blockera en specifik signalmolekyl som heter PPAR - γ . Resultaten från studien tyder på att effekten från bakterierna förmedlas via denna signalväg och är beroende av mastceller . Vi kunde verifiera effekten från bakterierna i cell - odling , där i princip samma resultat kunde påvisas och fler detaljer utrönas . Bakterierna på - verkade mastcellerna att förändra sin utsöndringsprofil så att den blev mindre vävnadsska - dande och mer inflammationssänkande . Sammantaget bidrar resultaten från detta avhandlingsarbete med ny kunskap om hur mast - cellen deltar i regleringen av tarmens barriärfunktion vid stress och att denna reglering kan påverkas av probiotiska bakterier . Detta ger en möjlig förklaring till varför patienter med inflammatorisk tarmsjukdom ofta upplever förvärrade symptom , när de blir stressade . Vi - dare tycks probiotiska bakterier ha en positiv effekt på tjocktarmsinflammation och stress - reaktioner , effekter som delvis förmedlas via mastcellen .

INTRODUCTION General overview We are constantly threatened by a variety of microbes ranging from viruses and bacteria to parasites . The first line of defense is the barrier function of our intestine , skin , and lungs , which protects us from potentially dangerous organisms . If a microbe succeeds in entering the body , an immune response is necessary . The innate immune response is a non - specific way of eliminating pathogens . If the innate immune system fails to eliminate the pathogen , adaptive immunity takes over with a response that is highly specific towards one particular pathogen . The intestine is superficially a muscular tube that extends from the lower end of the stom - ach to the anus . It is divided into two major sections ; the small intestine and the large intes - tine . The intestinal mucosa constitutes one of the largest surface areas that is exposed to and interacts with the external environment . The area of the small intestine itself is about 250m 2 1 , 2 , and the gastrointestinal tract plays an important role because it absorbs digested dietary antigens and also serves as sites of innate and adaptive immune regulation . The abil - ity to maintain the delicate balance between absorbing essential nutrients , while preventing entry and responding to potentially harmful contents , forms the foundation of the intestinal mucosal barrier 3 . Intestinal anatomy and physiology The small intestine consists of duodenum , jejunum and ileum . The large intestine is subdi - vided into the cecum , colon , rectum and anal canal . The total length of the intestine de - pends on a person’s size and age but is usually around 7 . 5 meters ( 6 m small intestine and 1 . 5 m large intestine ) . A typical cross section of the intestinal wall is shown in figure 1 . The layers from the outer surface and inward are : the serosa , a longitudinal muscle layer , a cir - cular muscle layer , the lamina propria and the epithelium . The intestinal mucosa is the largest contact area and one of the most important barriers to the outside environment . It is highly specialized in aiding us digest and absorb nutrients . It is daily exposed to several potentially dangerous substances and microorganisms , which if they were allowed to pass into the body , could give rise to diseases . The ability to hinder these dangerous substances and organisms to enter our body is referred to as barrier func - tion 4 . The intestinal mucosa is continuously exposed to a high content of bacteria and therefore needs to be specialized in controlling the invasion of foreign and dangerous agents . The first step in preventing invasion is a high content of gastric acids and biliary juic - es in the stomach and duodenum . Adhesion of microbes that survive this environment is further prevented by the mucus layer covering the intestinal epithelium 5 that constitutes a physical barrier between the intestinal mucosa and the luminal content . The barrier integri - ty is primarily maintained by enterocytes connected to each other via junctional complexes . 2 F i g u r e 1 . S m a ll i n t e s t i n a l a r c h i t e c t u r e T h e f i g u r e ill u s t r a t e s t h e s t r u c t u r a l o r g a n i z a t i o n o f t h e s m a ll i n t e s t i n e . 3 The lining of the small intestine is characterized by numerous finger - like protrusions called villi . The epithelium covering the mucosa consists of many different cell types with special - ized functions . Enterocytes are the most abundant cell type and mediate the absorption of nutrients . Their luminal surface is covered with microvilli that increase the surface area of the cells and help to increase their absorptive ability . Scattered along the epithelium are also mucus - secreting goblet cells and at the base of the cryps , Paneth cells . The Paneth cells prevent bacterial proliferation by releasing anti - microbial factors like defensis , TNFα , lyso - zyme and phospholipases . Enteroendocrine cells are also found throughout the epithelium releasing gastrointestinal hormones like secretin , neurotensin and somatostatin in response to changes in the microenvironment . The polarized , single cell layer that lines the inner surface of the small intestine consists of villus epithelium ( VE ) and follicle - associated epithelium ( FAE ) . Briefly , the FAE specifically covers the Peyer’s patches in the intestine and is specialized in uptake of antigen and bacte - ria for immune - sampling . Peyer’s patches are organized lymphoid follicles that are spread throughout the human small intestine 6 . The follicles consist of B cell germinal centers and marginal zones with proliferating B lymphocytes and macrophages . The area in between the FAE and the follicle is referred to the subepithelial dome and contains T cells , B cells , den - dritic cells , macrophages and monocytes 7 . The FAE contains about 10 % membranous ( M ) cells that have irregular microvilli structure and less microvilli than regular VE enterocytes 8 . Simplified , the VE is specialized in nutrient uptake and consists of the cell types described above , while the FAE and M cells are specialized in antigen sampling and transport to the underlying follicle 9 . The main function of the large intestine is absorption of electrolytes and water along with removal of undigested food and waste . Here the mucosa is arranged in crypts , where nu - merous strait tubular glands are present and it does not have the same villus structure as the small intestine . Still , colonic epithelium contains the same cell types as the small intes - tine but to a different extent . The enterocytes express shorter microvilli than those seen in enterocytes of the small intestine , with glycocalyx absent of digestive enzymes . Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells are less abundant in the large intestine while Goblet cells are more common . Goblet cells are usually found in the crypts and their number increases dis - tally towards the rectum . Colonic M cells like cells can be found in epithelium covering co - lonic lymphoid follicle 10 . The gastrointestinal tract is connected to the brain via a bidirectional communication sys - tem . The communication between the gut and the brain is referred to as the gut - brain axis , or brain - gut axis depending on the origin or field of focus . The brain - gut axis is comprised of neural pathways such as the enteric nervous system , vagus , sympathetic and spinal nerves . It also includes humoral pathways which comprises cytokines , hormones and neuropeptides as signaling molecules 11 . Traditionally researchers were focused on the psychological status 4 affecting the function of the intestine , however recent studies show that the gut microbiota communicates with the brain 12 . Intestinal immunology The gut mucosal immune system is the largest immune organ in the body , contains more than 10 12 lymphocytes and produces more IgA than any other site 13 . The gut - associated lymphoid tissues include Peyer’s patches , mesenteric lymph nodes and a large number of cells spread out throughout the lamina propria and within the epithelium . Besides serving as the first line of defense against luminal antigens , the gut - associated lymphoid tissues are capable of modulating the epithelial function 14 . In addition to maintaining a physical barrier , the intestine is actively involved in immune surveillance at the Peyer’s patch lymphoid folli - cles 15 . M cells samples particles and bacteria from the lumen and transfer them to the un - derlying lymphocytes . Dendritic cells are also capable of directly sampling luminal bacteria by extending their dendrites between epithelial cells via the tight junctions 16 . It is an imper - ative for the lymphoid tissue to distinguish between pathogens and normal microflora . Un - der physiological conditions , lymphocytes sample antigens and travel to immune competent sites where they induce T regulatory responses 17 . Pathogens are distinguished from com - mensal bacteria by pathogen - associated molecular pattern receptors found on antigen pre - senting cells such as epithelial cells , dendritic cells and macrophages 18 . Intestinal microbiota The human microflora or “microbiota” include bacteria , fungi , bacteriophages and viruses on or in the human body 19 . The human intestinal microbiota changes during our lifespan . We are born germfree and the first colonization occurs at birth and the first feeding 20 . After the first two - three years the microbiota becomes more stable but will continue to change under the influence of age , immune maturation , nutritional and environmental factors 19 , 21 . The bacterial content of the adult gut is about 1 - 2 kilograms , include around one thousand different species and more than 15 000 different strains of bacteria 19 , 21 . The total amount of bacterial cells in the human body is around 10 14 , which is ten times the number of human cells in the body 22 . The microbiota density and diversity increases from the stomach to the colon 23 . The most abundant phyla in the human gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla 24 , but also Archaea 25 and Eukarya 26 . Our intestinal microbiota help increase our metabolic capacity by metabolizing otherwise indigestible polysaccharides and producing essential vitamins 27 . It also regulate develop - ment of intestinal villus vascular architecture 28 , maturation of the gastrointestinal tract 29 and development of immune response 30 . It has also been shown that gut microbiota modu - lates adiposity 31 and bone mass 32 in mice . 5 Intestinal barrier function The intestinal barrier serves two critical functions : It enables controlled nutrient absorption and defends the body from potentially dangerous substances 33 . Under normal conditions the intestinal barrier allows small amounts of antigens to pass the mucosa and interact with the immune system . The balance in regulating the barrier is crucial to maintain normal nu - trient uptake and a balanced antigen sampling . Many factors can alter this bal - ance : gut microbiota modifications , mucus layer alterations , and epithelial damage can in - crease intestinal permeability , allowing the translocation of luminal content to the inner layer of intestinal wall 34 . If the control of the barrier function is disturbed the consequences may damage the mucosa and lead to pathological conditions 33 . Stress Stress is a normal component of life and adequate responses to different stressful situations are required for survival . However , there are large individual variations in the possibility to cope with stressful events 35 . Stress has been defined as a disruption of homeostasis , which may be triggered by a physical or psychological stimulus that produces mental and physio - logical reactions that might lead to illness 36 . The physiological response to stress consists of a rapid and a slower component 37 . The rapid response is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system , which increases levels of cir - culating norepinephrine and epinephrine . This is referred to as the “sympathetic - adren - omedullary system” 38 . The slower but longer - lasting response is the activation of the hypo - thalamic pituary adrenocortical ( HPA ) axis that begins with the release of corticotropin re - leasing factor ( CRF ) from hypothalamus into the circulation . CRF then stimulates the pitui - tary release of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) into the bloodstream . Released ACTH increase the discharge of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex 39 . Once the stressor has ended the glucocorticoids act via negative feedback on the pituitary gland , hypothalamus , hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to reduce further production and release of CRF and ACTH 39 . The physiological consequences include peripheral vasoconstriction , increased heart rate and increased energy mobilization 40 . Stress and intestinal barrier function In animal models both chronic and acute stress affects intestinal barrier function via mast cells 41 . During chronic stress in rodents , the adhesion and uptake of antigen and bacteria in the mucosa are increased , which leads to accumulation of mast cells and microscopic in - flammation 42 . Barreau et al . showed that neonatal maternal deprivation of rats induces closer association of colonic mast cells with nerves , which is similar to that seen in IBS pa - tients 43 . In humans the association between stress and decreased barrier function is not as well studied as in animals . It is known that psychological stress affects the ion secretion in humans 44 and it is known that severe stress episodes are an important risk factor for the development and reactivation intestinal inflammation 45 . In patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) there is a significant association between acute daily stress and bowel symptoms 46 . For irritable bowel symptom ( IBS ) patients stressful life events increase the risk 6 of developing post - infectious IBS and a relation between stress and symptom severity is noticeable 47 . Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide and intestinal barrier function Vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) behaves like a non - adrenergic , non - cholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the small intestine 48 and directly innervates the intestinal epithelium and regulates ion and fluid secretion 49 , 50 . VIP and the pituitary adenylate cyclase - activating polypeptides ( PACAPs ) share 68 % homology and belong to the secretin peptide family . The physiological actions of these peptides are produced through activation of three common G - protein - coupled receptors ( VPAC1 , VPAC2 and PAC1R ) , which stimulate the adenylate cyclase and increase intracellular cAMP , calcium and phospholipase D 51 . Several studies have also suggested the involvement of VIP in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier homeostasis 52 and paracellular permeability 53 , 54 . Also , numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of VIP in inflammation 55 - 57 . There are , however , very few articles regarding the involvement of VIP in intestinal barrier function during stress . Increased VIP levels have been demonstrated in mouse ileum after acute stress 58 , but there are no studies regarding VIP and FAE permeability . Studies of VIP expression on or in connection to intestinal mast cells in the intestine were lacking at the start of this PhD - project . Apical junctional complex The junctional complexes that connect the enterocytes are important components of the intestinal homeostasis . The paracellular space between each cell needs to be tightly regu - lated to avoid leakage or influx of antigens . The junctional complexes consist of several groups of multi - protein structures , the tight junctions ( TJs ) , adherens junctions , desmo - somes and gap junctions . All apical junctions help hold the enterocytes together and regu - late the paracellular permeability . The TJs are the major regulatory unit of the epithelial barrier and is located closest to the intestinal lumen , as illustrated in figure 2 . Tight junctions Adherens junctions Gap junctions Desmosomes Figure 2 . Junctional complexes The figure illustrates the localization of the different groups of junctional complexes 7 Tight junctions The most important integral components of the TJs are occludin , claudins , junctional adhe - sion molecule ( JAM ) and tricellulin 59 . The TJs are closely associated with the zonula oc - cludens ( ZO ) and cingulin proteins , which are macromolecules at the intracellular part of the tight junctional plaque . TJs are imperative for the establishment and stability of epithelial barriers 60 . They mediate cell - cell adhesion and thereby create a mechanical and charged barrier for selective permeability of macromolecules and ions . The transmembrane compo - nents of TJs achieve membrane polarity by blockage of the circulation and mixing of pro - teins and lipids along the cell membrane 61 . TJs interact with the actin cytoskeleton and are directly or indirectly related to the adherens 62 and gap junctions . 63 The intracellular compo - nents can also act as sensors for extracellular events by triggering a variety of signaling pathways and communicating these to the cell nucleus . TJs are furthermore regulated both from intracellular and extracellular events . Intracellular events that may influence TJ stabil - ity are related to energy depletion and cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) level changes . Adenosine - 5 ' - triphosphate ( ATP ) depletion down - regulates TJs 64 , while cAMP in - duces an increase in the transepithelial resistance and a reduction in the paracellular per - meability 65 . Extracellular events that can alter TJ regulation are for instance : • Direct interaction of TJ proteins with proteins of other cells – e . g . leucocyte mem - brane antigens that induce site - specific TJ dissociation 66 . • Direct interactions with external toxins – e . g . Claudin 3 , 4 and occludin are receptors for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin 67 . • Indirect paracellular effects and hormone stimuli – e . g proteases 68 , interleukins 66 , in - terferons 69 , leukotrienes 70 and growth factors 65 . There is growing evidence that alterations in TJ expression and composition are associated with several different gastrointestinal diseases . Specifically , changes have been observed in celiac disease 71 , IBS 72 , 73 and IBD 71 , 74 . Moreover , how several inflammatory mediators in - volved in IBD may affect TJ permeability has recently been reviewed by Suzuki et al 75 . Experimental and clinical studies also suggest , that psychological stress exerts negative ef - fects on intestinal TJs and increases gut permeability in IBS and IBD 44 , which is further dis - cussed later . Adherens junctions Adherens junctions are located under the TJs and are formed by adhesion molecules of the Ca 2 + dependent E - cadherin family and their cytoplasmic binding partners α - , β - and γ - catenins . They are defined as cell junctions whose cytoplasmic part is linked to the actin cytoskeleton . The cadherins form homodimers with cadherins on adjacent cells and is in turn anchored to the actin cytoskeleton of the cell by α - catenin . The adherens junctions are important for cell - cell adhesion and integral parts in the maintenance of epithelial integrity 76 . 8 Desmosomes The desmosomes are spot - like adhesions randomly arranged on the lateral sides of plasma membranes but usually below the adherens junctions . The cell adhesion proteins of the desmosome are also members of the cadherin family of cell adhesion proteins . It consists of an extracellular core domain , outer and inner dense plaques . The inner one attaches the desmosome complex to cytoskeletal intermediate filaments . Desmosome assembly is regu - lated by calcium , kinase / phosphatase activity , proteolytic activity and cross - talk with ad - herens junctions . The primary function of desmosomes is a strong intercellular adhesion also known as hyperadhesion , but they also have signaling functions and are important in tissue development and remodeling . 77 Gap junctions Gap Junctions consist of six connexins that associate with each other and form a connexon hemichannel . The connexons , once fused with the plasma membrane , create intercellular channels with connexons on neighboring cells . Thereby they link the cytoplasm of two cells and provide a way of exchanging ions , second messengers , e . g . cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) ) and small metabolites , allowing electrical and biochemical cou - pling between cells . Gap junctional communication is important for cell differentiation , growth and metabolic coordination . 78 , 79 Active uptake and epithelial transport Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize extracellular molecules and particles , such as proteins or bacteria , but they thereby also drink liquids and solutes . All cells use en - docytosis to absorb molecules that cannot pass through the hydrophobic cell membrane . Most in vivo studies of epithelial endocytosis have been conducted on small intestinal villous and follicle associated epithelium . The endocytosis pathways are subdivided depending on the mechanisms involved in each process and are described further below ( Figure 3 ) . Figure 3 . Cell endocytosis and passage The figure illustrates different processes of internalization and passage . A ) Clathrin - / Caveola - mediated uptake . B ) Clathrin and caveolin - independent uptake . C ) Macropinocytocis . D ) Phagocytosis . E ) Paracel - lular passage . F ) Transcellular passage . 9 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis This type of endocytosis is a receptor - ligand mediated pinocytosis and a most studied mechanism . After binding the cargo molecule with trans - membranous high affinity recep - tors the complex concentrates in coated pits , which are formed by clathrins and other pro - teins like assembly protein 2 adaptor complexes and dynamin GTPase . The coated pit invag - inates and forms a endocytic vesicle with the receptor ligand complex on the inside 80 . Clath - rin - mediated endocytosis is used for uptake of essential nutrients and in cell homeostasis to regulate internalization of ion pumps , ion channels and also the intestinal barrier in IBD 81 . Caveola - mediated endocytosis This process involves cholesterol and sphingolipid - rich microdomains in the cell membrane . The microdomains form invaginations where many signaling molecules and membrane transporters are concentrated . Caveolin creates a coat on the invagination in the surface of the cell membrane that binds cholesterol . Inside the caveola invagination , receptors bind cargo proteins and by subsequent signaling cascades involving G - protein and kinases the invagination is internalized 80 . Transcellular transport of albumin and regulation of TJ pro - teins have been shown to occur via the caveola route 82 . Also , viral enterotoxins use it for amplification and viral morphogenesis 83 . Clathrin & caveolin - independent endocytosis These mechanisms are dependent on cholesterol and require small rafts of specific lipid composition 80 . The rafts diffuse freely in the cell membrane and can be captured and inter - nalized by any endocytic vesicle . How this proceeds is not fully understood but seems to be dependent on the small G protein cdc42 and glycosylphosphatidylinositol - linked proteins but can bypass conventional rab5 - positive endocytic compartments 84 , 85 . Clathrin independ - ent endocytosis occurs in neuroendocrine cells and neurons enabling rapid recovery of membrane proteins after secretion 86 . Phagocytosis & macropinocytosis Phagocytosis is a special form of endocytosis of solids e . g . large particles , microbes and remnants of dead cells 87 . Receptors for antigen uptake are expressed on the cell membrane . Fc - receptors recognize and bind antibodies bound to antigens for instance on the surface of microbes 88 . A signaling cascade triggers formation of extensions or protrusions from the cell membrane engulfing the pathogen and creating a phagosome . An inflammatory response is then triggered and the phagosome fuses with degradation vesicles ( lysosomes ) to destroy the content of the phagosome . Fragments of the pathogen are then presented on the sur - face of the phagocytic cell to provoke a response from the adaptive immune response . Phagocytosis is mainly observed in macrophages , monocytes , dendritic cells and neutrophils but bacterial internalization has been shown in enterocytes 89 . Phagocytosis is also important for the non - specific uptake of luminal dietary and bacterial antigens and is common in M cells 90 . 10 Macropinocytosis resembles phagocytosis but is not receptor mediated and engulfs a liquid drop with its content rather than a solid particle 88 . Instead of extending the cell membrane to engulf , the process of macropinocytosis almost collapses onto and fuses with the cell membrane to generate a macropinosom . Colonic enterocytes , M cells and dendritic cells are triggered into prolonged macropinocytic activity by antigen activation 91 . The protein antigen horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) is known to be taken up by this mechanism 92 and viral anti - gens induce macropinocytosis in order to amplify viral uptake 93 . Transcytosis Transcytosis is the process by which various macromolecules are transported inside an en - dosome across the interior of the cell . Proteins in the cell membrane can either remain at the cell surface or rapidly be internalized into early endosomes , which are then transported to either apical or basolateral sorting compartments 94 . They can then either recycle to the cell membrane with or without releasing the endocytotic protein or merge with lysosomes , or be transported from one cell membrane to another 94 . Early endosomes can also be deliv - ered to late endosomes and merge with lysosomes . The cargo is then usually degraded and the endosomal receptor proteins recycle back to the cell surface 91 . The operation of these transport routes requires that several sorting decisions are continuously made . These are governed by a system of sorting signals in the cargo proteins and molecular machinery that recognizes the signals and delivers the protein to their intended destination . 11 Mast cells Mast cells have traditionally been recognized as initiators of allergic diseases and have only fairly recently been shown to play fundamental roles in innate and adaptive immune re - sponses to infection and inflammatory autoimmune diseases 95 , 96 . There is also evidence that they take part in inflammatory responses to developing tumors , which may either expedite or impede tumor growth depending on the type of cancer 97 , 98 . Mast cells are also involved in other functions such as promotion of angiogenesis , tissue remodeling and wound healing 99 , 100 . They are versatile cells that contain numerous secretory granules in the cyto - plasm and are distributed throughout the body in several different tissues . For the most part mast cells are located around blood vessels and nerve endings in skin 101 , gastrointesti - nal tract 102 , respiratory organs 103 and to a lesser extent in the brain 104 . The great possibilities displayed by the mast cell in its response to different stimuli make it a truly interesting cell type that can act both positively and negatively on the host . Origin and subtypes Mast cells are derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow and mature in peripheral tissues 105 . Circulating human mast cell precursors are defined as being CD34 + , c - kit + and CD13 + cells 106 . Mature mast cells are distributed throughout the body , located strategically in tissues that interface the outside world . Different types of mast cells are found depending on the influence of different microenvironments in various tissues 107 . Hu - man mast cells are classified according to their granule contents . Mast cells , that contain only tryptase and resemble rodent mucosal mast cells in their distribution pattern in the mucosal layer of the gut and lungs , are referred to as MCTs in rodents . Those that resemble rodent connective tissue mast cells contain tryptase , chymase and carboxypeptidase A , and are mainly found in skin 108 , 109 and referred to as MCTCs . Despite these differences it has been suggested that mast cell phenotypes are interchangeable depending on the anatomi - cal microenvironment 110 . Paul Ehrlich ( 1854 - 1915 ) The mast cell was first described 1878 by Paul Ehrlich in his dis - sertation entitled “Beiträge zur Theorie und Praxis der histolo - gischen Färbung” which translates to “Contributions to the The - ory and Practice of Histological staining” . When he was using aniline dye , granules of the protoplasm were stained blue . He believed the cells had a nutritional function and named them “Mastzellen” after the German word “mast” which implies a fattening or suckling function . In 1908 Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine together with Ilya Mech - nikov for their “work on immunity” . 12 Activation Mast cells are armed with a large selection of receptors , which enables them to interact with their environment . The most well - known activation of mast cells occurs by interaction of a multivalent antigen with its specific IgE antibody bound to the cell membrane via the FcεRI receptor . They can however also be activated by non - IgE - related substances , like cyto - kines , neuropeptides , immunoglobulin - free light chains , polybasic compounds , complement components and certain drugs 111 ( Figure 4 ) . Fc receptors Mast cells express receptors for the Fc part of both IgE and IgG antibodies . The FcεRI is a high - affinity receptor for IgE and FcγRI for IgG . FcγRII and FcγRIII are low - affinity receptors for IgG 112 . FcεRI - mediated activation of mast cells is a well - established reaction , which has been used in studies of allergic reactions 113 , 114 . IgE can even bind the FcεRI and effect mast cells without being bound to an antigen 113 . FcγR can only bind IgG - antigen complexes and regulate mast cell activation both positively and negatively 115 . Complement receptors The complement system includes more than 30 serum proteins and cell - surface receptors , that facilitate host defense through opsonization , chemotaxis , leukocyte activation and cell lysis 116 . Mast cells express complement receptor ( CR ) 3 , CR4 , CR5 and products of comple - ment activation such as C3aR and C5aR 115 . There is , however , evidence that receptor ex - pression and response to receptor stimulation are different in mast cells depending on their anatomical location , differentiation state and cytokine environment 117 . Figure 4 . Examples of mast cell receptors 13 CD117 CD117 , also known as tyrosine - protein kinase Kit or c - kit is a member of the growth factor receptors with inherent tyrosine kinase activity family . CD117 activation is important for mast cell growth , differentiation and survival 118 . It can also induce mast cell migration through chemotaxis 119 . When stem cell factor ( SCF ) , the specific ligand for kit , binds the re - ceptor it dimerizes and initiates downstream signaling . Kit activation alone is not sufficient to induce degranulation of mast cells but it can induce cytokine production and under ex - perimental conditions modulate mast cell degranulation and cytokine production 120 . Toll - Like Receptors Pathogen - recognizing receptors , like Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , are expressed on mast cells indicating that mast cells could directly participate in host defense 121 . Mast cells express TLR 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 9 . Each of these receptors recognizes a distinct category of microbial prod - ucts . TLR2 binds to peptidoglycans , TLR3 to double - stranded RNA , TLR4 to lipopolysaccha - rides and bacterial DNA binds to TRL9 115 . The primary response to TLR ligands is production of inflammatory cytokines rather than degranulation 121 . Neuropeptide receptors Mast cells express several different neuropeptide receptors , which belong to the G protein coupled receptor family . The most - studied neuropeptide is substance P that acts on mast cells via the neurokinin - 1 receptor ( NK1R ) 122 , 123 , but they also express receptors for cortico - trophin releasing factor ( CRF ) 124 , 125 , calcitonin gene related peptide ( CGRP ) 123 , vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) 122 , 126 and nerve growth factor ( NGF ) 111 . Antimicrobial peptide receptors Mast cells are reported to form extracellular DNA - chromatin webs , with cathelicidin LL - 37 attached , that may trap and kill microbes 127 . In addition to their direct antimicrobial activity they also induce cytolysis by forming membrane pores and under certain conditions sup - press essential microbial intracellular functions 128 . The antimicrobial peptides also act indi - rectly by augmenting innate and adaptive immune responses . One of these indirect actions is the induction of inflammatory responses through mast cells activation and recruitment of other immune cells 123 . Antimicrobial peptides like defensins and LL - 37 stimulate mast cell chemotaxis and induce degranulation of several prostaglandins and cytokines 129 , 130 . Howev - er , the identity of the receptors is not revealed but studies have shown a dependence on phosphatidylinositide 3 - kinase and protein kinase C 129 . 14 Secretion The activation of mast cells leads to degranulation and release of a plethora of various me - diators , both preformed and newly synthetized ( Figure 5 ) . Preformed mediators The degranulation occurs within seconds of mast cell activation and the initial phase is es - sentially complete within 5 - 10 minutes 131 . Histamine is the predominant granule mediator of acute reactions in mast cell activation , but proteases such as tryptase , chymase and car - boxypepidase constitute the major components of mast cell granules 132 , 133 . Mast cell prote - ases constitute 30 - 50 % of the total protein content of the cells and β - tryptase is the major protease being expressed . The protease expression is heterogeneous depending on pheno - type and location in the tissue . As an example mast cells located in mucosal tissue contain primarily tryptase , while those located in skin and submucosa contain chymase and carbox - ypeptidase . 132 , 133 Histamine is retained in mast cell granules by proteoglycans as heparin and chondroitin E . After secretion , histamine diffuses through the tissue and the circulatory system and exerts its effect through four histamine receptors , H1 - H4 . Histamine is rapidly inactivated by histamine N - metyl transferase and diamine oxidase . 134 Eicosanoids The eicosanoids , leukotriene C 4 ( LTC 4 ) , LTB 4 , prostaglandin D 2 ( PGD 2 ) and under some cir - cumstances PGE 2 , are generated and released almost simultaneously with the granule - associated mediators in mast cells 135 . Figure 5 : Mast cell degranulation 15 Cytokines and chemokines Mast cells generate a plethora of both cytokines and chemokines ; cytokines include : IL - 3 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , IL - 13 , IL - 33 , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and TNFα and chemokines CCL2 , CCL3 , CCL5 and CXCL8 108 , 136 . In contrast to degranula - tion , the secretion of the cytokines and chemokines is a slower process taking several hours before significant levels can be detected . Although mast cells can store smaller amounts of certain cytokines like TNFα in their granules , the levels following mast cell activation are much higher 137 . Other Mediators Activated mast cells are also a source of angiogenic peptides and growth factors , such as angiopoietin - 1 , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , tumor growth factor β ( TGFβ ) , nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and renin 99 , 138 , 139 . Function Mast cells are strategically located at sites of possible antigen entry and are capable guards that are equipped to participate in immune responses . Biological functions of mast cells are as described above dependent on mediators released after activation and result in recruit - ment of leukocytes , mucosal exudation , angiogenesis , fibrosis , activation of T lymphocytes and interaction with the nervous system 111 . Luminal antigens present in the gastrointestinal tract with the potential to activate mast cells are food allergens , bacteria , parasitic nema - todes , invading pathogens and self - antigens . Role in immunity The distribution of mast cells in skin and mucosal surfaces , and their wide array of receptors place them in a prime position for detection of invading microorganisms . They have been shown to play a crucial protective role in animal models against bacterial infections in lung 140 - 142 , intestine 143 and skin 142 by facilitating clearance of bacteria from these tissues or by limiting skin lesions . In some studies the protective effect was dependent on mast cell production of TNFα 140 , 142 , IL - 6 141 and leukotrienes 144 as well as on recruitment of neut - rophils 140 and dendritic cells 142 . Information on mast cell involvement during viral infections is limited , but it is known that mast cell numbers increase during pulmonary viral infections 145 and cultured mast cells can be activated by viral products 146 . Fungi are known to exacerbate airway inflammatory disease by IgE - dependent mechanisms and has been shown to induce degranulation of mast cells in vitro 147 . Moreover , fungal spores potentiate IgE - dependent release from human cells obtained from bronchial lavage 148 . Yeast zymosan is an activator of mast cells that results in mast cell mediated peritoneal inflammation in mice 149 and release of IL - 6 , GM - CSF , IL - 1β and leukotrienes but not degranulation 150 . Apart from acting as first responders to microbial agents , mast cells can recruit other im - mune cells within lymph nodes to start the adaptive immune responses 151 and promote re - cruitment of T cells 152 . Mast cell - derived TNFα seem to play an important role in lymph node 16 hypertrophy during bacterial infection 153 , contact dermatitis 154 and IgE crosslinking 155 . It is also apparent that mast cells stimulate migration of peripheral lymphocytes 153 , Langerhans cells 156 and dendritic cells 157 to regional lymph nodes thereby promoting interaction be - tween antigen presenting cells and T helper cells 158 or activation of cytotoxic T cells 159 . Role in inflammation and intestinal disease Mast cells are most well - known for their role in IgE - mediated allergic inflammation . The focus has mainly been on the acute phase characterized by the release of mast cell media - tors . The early mediators cause most of the pathology associated with allergy , including in - creased vascular permeability , smooth muscle contraction and induction of mucus secret - ion 112 . It has , however , become evident that mast cell activation during allergic reactions is more complex . The reactions are currently considered to be multiphasic and include also a late phase and a chronic phase . The late phase is characterized by leucocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation and initiation of an acquired immune response , and the chronic is associated with persistent inflammation , tissue remodeling and fibrosis . 160 Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) is an idiopathic disease characterized by alternating peri - ods of symptomatic disease and remission . Patients with IBD suffer from abdominal pain and cramps , weight loss , diarrhea , disrupted digestion and rectal bleeding . IBD can be sub - divided into 2 major representatives : Crohn ' s disease ( CD ) and Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) 161 . CD and UC can be defined by the different location of the inflammation in the gastrointesti - nal tract and immunological and histological patterns . Briefly , CD is characterized by in - flammation throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract but mainly in the terminal ileum . UC is a mucosal inflammation restricted to the colon . An increased mucosal permeability has previously been reported in both UC 162 and CD 163 . The exact etiology of IBD remains unknown but is thought to be a complex interaction of genetic , environmental and immunological factors 164 ( figure 6 ) . Current investigations and observations suggest that the initial event in IBD is a result of a dysregulated immune re - sponse rather than an aggressive inflammatory response 111 , 165 . Increased numbers of mast cells have been seen in colonic mucosa from patients with CD and UC 166 . Mast cell content and degranulation of TNFα , IL6 , substance P , histamine , pros - taglandines and tryptase are also altered in IBD patients 167 . Smaller studies with ketotifen , a mast cell stabilizer , have shown beneficial effect in IBD 168 and UC 169 . In a phase II study on UC patients the tryptase inhibitor APC 2059 showed symptom improvement in more than 50 % of the patients 170 further strengthens the role of mast cells in IBD . 17 Irritable bowel syndrome IBS is a chronic intestinal disorder often associated with abdominal pain , altered bowel mo - tility resulting in diarrhea or constipation , and an increase in visceral hypersensitivity 73 , 166 , 171 . The pathogenesis of IBS is also poorly understood and defined , but implicated are psychological factors , food hypersensitivity , and gastrointestinal infections 172 - 174 ( Figure 6 ) . Currently IBS is thought to be the result of dysregulation in the brain - gut axis 73 , 175 . Stress is one of the key triggers of IBS , and both physical and psychological stress - ors have been associated with the pathophysiology of IBS 44 . IBS patients have shown increased number of mast cells in colon and ileum 176 and a positive correlation between the number of mucosal mast cells and intestinal permeability has been shown 177 . Additionally , an increased mucosal expression of tryptase 178 and release of tryp - tase 176 into the lumen has been described in IBS patients . The mast cell stabilizer ketotifen decreases the visceral hypersensitivity and reduces symptoms in IBS patients 179 . Figure 6 . Pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome 18 Stress and Mast cells Mast cells are an integral part of the stress response system . Stress induces the release of CRF from the hypothalamus through activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis , which in turn leads to secretion of glucocorticoids that can down - regulate the immune system 180 . However , it is only when CRF is secreted outside of the brain by local neurons , or from immune cells , such as eosinophils 181 that it exerts pro - inflammatory effects through its effects on mast cells 182 . Figure 7 : Mast cell nerv interactions 19 Probiotics Probiotics are according to WHO " Live microorganisms which when administered in ade - quate amounts confer a health benefit on the host " . Today the most common probiotics are either Bifido bacteria or Lactobacilli and we can acquire them in yoghurts , where special selected strains have been added . Probiotics and intestinal barrier function Several animal studies have shown significant advantages on intestinal permeability after administration of probiotics 183 - 185 . In humans , probiotics have also displayed positive effects on maintenance - treatment of pouchitis 186 and of remission in UC 187 , 188 . Several studies have displayed that the use of probiotics reduces IBS symptoms 189 , 190 . Still , there is one study where the use of probiotics have had negative effects and actually even increased mortality in severely ill , intensive care patients 191 . The mechanisms by which probiotics exert their effect are highly complex and to a large extent unknown . To be able to use probiotics full potential we need to further figure out the details on how they actually affect us . Peroxisome Proliferator - Activated Receptors and intestinal barrier function Peroxisome Proliferator - Activated Receptors ( PPARs ) are a group of three transcription fac - tors originally implicated in adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis . PPAR - γ , one of its isoforms , is known to exert anti - inflammatory effects by interfering with activity of inflammatory transcription factors , such as NF - κB 192 , activating protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) 193 , and sig - nal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 194 . It is expressed in various tissues and cell types including intestinal tissue and dendritic cells 195 and plays a role in regulation of intestinal inflammation . Administration of synthetic PPAR - γ agonists reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines in dendritic cells 196 and ameliorates intestinal inflammation in different experimental colitis models 197 , 198 . Up - regulation of intestinal PPAR - γ expression occurs in response to stress signals such as LPS challenge 199 or stress - induced colonic in - flammation 200 , suggesting that the enhanced expression of PPAR - γ in the colon may occur as an adaptive and compensatory mechanism to help down - regulate mucosal inflammation . Probiotic bacteria have been shown to affect PPAR - γ , modulating intestinal epithelial in - Ilya Mechnikov ( 1845 - 1916 ) Ilya Mechnikov was a Russian scientist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Paul Ehrlich 1908 . Mech - nicov observed that rural people in Bulgaria lived to very old ages despite extreme poverty and harsh conditions . He noted that their diets were rich in yoghurt and other fermented milk products which strengthened his theories on the beneficial qualities of the lactic acid bacteria produced by fermentation . Mechnikov and his colleagues began drinking sour milk to pop - ulate their own gut flora , thereby introducing the modern pro - biotic . 20 flammatory responses and barrier function 201 , 202 . For example , Ewaschuk et al . 199 showed that probiotics can attenuate intestinal barrier dysfunction in mice via a PPAR - γ dependent pathway in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced sepsis . This was proved by the fact , that bene - ficial effects of probiotics were abolished by PPAR - γ inhibition . However , the precise inter - actions between probiotics and this anti - inflammatory defense system are largely unknown . Models to study intestinal permeability In silico Computer models for predicting mucosal permeability have been present since the 1980s 203 . Several theoretical models have been developed to predict passive permeation characteris - tics 204 . The models are based on several statistical methodologies and a variety of computa - tional models have been used to predict drug absorption 204 , 205 . In silico methods contribute to early pharmaceutical research and are important in target and lead discoveries . The con - tribution of knowledge from in silico models are predicted to increase in a foreseeable fu - ture but are at their best not as reliable as real experimental data for predicting intestinal permeability and absorption of molecules . 206 In vitro The benefits of using in vitro techniques over in vivo techniques for permeability studies include that they are less labor and cost - intensive but also because they do not involve the same ethical considerations 207 . Each in vitro model has its advantages and drawbacks but the main factor is how closely the model mimics the in vivo system . Cell culture models for intestinal permeability focuses mainly on passage through epithelial cell lines like Caco - 2 or MDCK . Different co - culture models with the goal of more closely mimicking intestinal epi - thelium have been proposed . One model uses Caco - 2 and HT29 cell lines with the advantage of adding mucin - sectreting cells and thus mimicking the physiological conditions to a larger extent 208 , 209 . Another co - culture model uses Caco - 2 and Raji B cells and is described in more detail under cell culture models used in this thesis . Even triple co - culture models have been presented that uses Caco - 2 , HT29 and Raji B cell lines 210 . The main disadvantage of in vitro models is that specific details are being studied and not the whole organism which might lead to results that to translate 206 . In situ Experiments for studying intestinal permeability and drug absorption involve perfusion of a marker solution into an isolated intestinal segment . The advantage of using these methods over in vitro techniques are the presence of intact blood supply and nerve interactions 206 . The permeability is usually assessed by measuring disappearance of marker or drug from the solution in the intestinal lumen . The presence of an intact nervous system , a blood flow and clearance capability generates a method that closely predicts in vivo conditions . These methods also provide the possibility to study permeability over a selected intestinal region . Drawbacks include disturbance of hydrodynamics due to the effect on the unstirred water 21 layer and difficulties coupled to sensitivity when measuring markers or drugs with low per - meability 206 . Ex vivo The ex vivo methods include experiments where excised tissue from animals or humans are the object of investigation . Examples of these techniques include intestinal perfusion loops and Ussing chamber experiments . The Ussing chamber technique has been used in the work included in this thesis and is described in greater detail under materials and methods . Brief - ly , the methods are used to investigate intestinal passage and transport mechanisms on live excised tissue . The advantage is that whole tissue is used , however , drawbacks include lack of blood supply and intact neural interaction . In vivo The advantage of in vivo techniques is that the whole organism is studied including factors like blood circulation , mucus layers , pH differences , gastrointestinal motility and transit time . All other methods strive to reach in vivo conditions or to predict in vivo function . Non - invasive in vivo intestinal permeability is assessed by measuring urinary excretion of orally administered substances or permeability markers . Invasive assessments include blood sam - pling after orally administered substances or markers . Normal markers used include poly - mers of polyethylene glycol , 51 Cr - EDTA , oligo - and monosaccharides 211 . Animal models pro - vide an intestinal mucosal membrane that is comparable to human 212 , but other species have different intestinal metabolizing enzymes , pH , microbiota , gastrointestinal motility and transit time 213 . Extrapolation of animal in vivo , ex vivo and in situ findings to human there - fore needs to be performed with caution 214 . Ethical considerations could also prove a limit - ing factor when performing in vivo experiments . Another potential disadvantage can be the difficulty to study isolated intestinal segments or specific mechanisms of transport across the intestinal epithelium . 22 AIMS The general aim of this thesis was to elucidate mechanisms of mast cell effects on intestinal barrier function during stress . Moreover , we wanted to determine if and how probiotics can ameliorate the mucosal barrier integrity during stress and colitis . Specific aims for the separate studies were to : I . Elucidate the role of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) and mast cells in FAE permeability during stress in rats and on human intestinal barrier function . II . Assess whether mast cells contribute to the positive effects of probiotic therapy on intestinal function in a rat model of chronic stress . III . Study if probiotics can modulate mast cell mediator release , resulting in amelioration of corticotropin - releasing factor ( CRF ) - induced barrier dysfunction in vitro . IV . Determine the effect of treatment with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii on intestinal barrier function in a dextran sodium sulphate ( DSS ) - induced colitis mice model . 23 MATERIALS & METHODS Ethical statement The studies presented in this dissertation have been conducted in accordance with the Dec - laration of Helsinki . Human tissue was collected from selected patients at Linköping Univer - sity Hospital by employees at the department of surgery and the endoscopy unit according to specific protocols . The studies were approved by the Regional Ethical Committee , Linkö - ping , Sweden and all donors gave their written informed consent . All animal studies were performed at Linköping University and were approved by the ethical committee on animal experiments , Linköping University , Sweden . Animal house monitoring through sentinels is performed quarterly according to FELASA standards . Patients In paper I , macroscopically normal specimens were taken from the terminal ileum next to the ileocaecal valve of 21 patients during surgery for colonic cancer . From five of the 21 pa - tients , distal colonic tissue was also obtained . The patients were nine men ( age 73 - 90 , mean 78 . 4 years ) and 12 women ( age 53 - 88 , mean 74 . 7 years ) with no generalized disease and none had received preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy . Animals All animals were acclimatized for at least one week prior to experiments . They were kept under constant housing conditions ( 12 hour light / dark cycle , 55±5 % humidity and 22±1°C ) and had free access to water and food throughout the experiment period . Rats were kept in pairs in 14 dm 3 cages ( 37cm x 21cm x 18cm ) . Mice were housed three per cage in individual - ly ventilated cages of 7 dm 3 ( 33cm x 16cm x 13cm ) . All cages were changed were changed weekly . In paper I , the study group consisted of 38 male Wistar rats ( B & K Universal AB , Sollentuna , Sweden ) . We chose to work with this strain because of previous experience in the group of adequate and reproducible reactions to acute water avoidance stress ( WAS ) 215 . The rats weighed 150 g at arrival and handled daily by the same person for 2 weeks prior to experi - ments . Some groups of mice received intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injections with VIP receptor blockers or mast cell stabilizers . In paper II , the study group consisted in total of 64 rats ( SLC Japan , Shizuoka , Japan ) . 32 rats were mast cell - deficient ( strain Ws / Ws ) and the remaining 32 were + / + littermate controls . The strain was chosen for their mast cell deficiency , which made it possible for us to study the role of mast cells in stress - related mucosal dysfunction . Also , this choice enabled us to observe if probiotics could exert their ameliorating effect without mast cells . This group of 24 rats were exposed to chronic WAS . Some groups of mice received i . p . injections with PPAR - γ antagonist . In paper IV , 56 female C57BL / 6 mice ( Scanbur BK AB , Sollentuna , Sweden ) . This strain of mice was chosen from previously published articles on Dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS ) - induced colitis 216 . The mice received daily oral administration of supernatant from F . prausnitzii and control groups received only broth . One group of animals received ( s . c . ) in - jections with PPAR - γ antagonist . Water avoidance stress We used water avoidance stress ( WAS ) , since it has been shown to be a reproducible model for psychological stress , mimicking daily life stress in humans , with minimal physical stress 217 . The model has previously been used in studies to assess psychological stress effects on intestinal permeability 45 , 218 . In addition to investigations on intestinal function , chronic WAS has also been widely used in psychiatric research as a model of depression 219 . The model can be used for both chronic and acute conditions . Prior to the experiments , all rats were handled daily by the researcher for two weeks to familiarize rats to human contact , thereby reducing the baseline stress level . During the stress period rats were placed on a platform ( h = 8 cm , d = 6 cm ) in a plastic container ( h = 56 cm , d = 50 cm ) with 25°C water ( water surface 1 cm below the platform ) . Control rats were left in their cages . After one hour , the faecal pellets were counted as a simple index of changes of colonic propulsive activity 220 . For acute experiments ( Paper I ) the WAS was performed during one hour on one occasion , and for chronic experiments ( Paper II ) during one hour per day for 10 consecutive days . After acute stress or the final experiment during chronic stress rats were anaesthetized by isofluran inhalation . Intestinal segments were dissected and put in ice - cold Krebs buffer for further use in the lab . Figure 8 . Rat submitted to water avoidance stress The photograph shows a rat placed on a platform sur - rounded by water inside a bigger container . The photo was acquired during one of the WAS experiments in pa - per 1 . 25 Experimental colitis Chemically induced murine models of colitis are one of the most commonly used models to study IBD . The models are used because they are simple to induce and onset , duration and severity of inflammation are immediate and controllable . Both dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS ) and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( TNBS ) - induced colitis are well - established animal models of mucosal inflammation 216 . The DSS - induced colitis model has previously been validated as a relevant model for translation of mice data to human IBD 221 . Also , clinical and histopatho - logical features of DSS - colitis reflect those seen in human IBD 221 . Since different mouse strains have diverse susceptibility to DSS treatment , previously published articles 261 , 262 gave us the advantage of knowing the concentration range of DSS to use to induce a reproducible level of colitis . We offered 3 % DSS in the drinking water ad libitum during 5 days to get an acute colitis . It is possible to use this method to get a model of chronic colitis , and then the DSS treatment is followed by a recovery period is repeated three times . In our experiments , mice started to show symptoms after 3 days of treatment and began to recover around 5 days after the treatment had stopped . Mice were weighed and monitored daily to follow the weight change and disease progression . If the mice showed excessive weight loss or exceeded ethical morbidity thresholds they were prematurely terminated . Cell lines All cell lines used in this thesis are commercially available from ATCC ( Manasses , VA , USA ) except the Caco - 2 clone 1 which was originally obtained as a kind gift from Dr . Maria Rescigno ( Milan , Italy ) . The Caco - 2 cell line is derived from a colon carcinoma . When cultured the cells differentiate and resemble enterocytes in the small intestine both morphologically and functionally . Caco - 2 cells express TJs , microvilli , enzymes and transporters that are charac - teristics of small intestine enterocytes 222 . We used a subclone of Caco - 2 , clone 1 , to study barrier function of the epithelium in vitro . This subclone appeared to be the best choice when tested for its ability to differentiate to M cells and maintain the M - cell phenotype over time 223 . Caco - 2 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM ) . Interestingly , this cell line when co - cultured with Raji B - cells generates M cell - like formation in some of the Caco - 2 cells creating an epithelium similar to FAE ( see further de - scription below ) . The T84 cell line is derived from a lung metastasis of a colon carcinoma in a 72 year old male . The tumor was inoculated sub - cutaneously and serially transplanted in mice until it was established in in vitro cultures 224 . Just as the Caco - 2 cell line this cell line grows to confluence as monolayers and exhibit TJs . We used these colon - phenotypic cells , because they reach confluence quickly and have a higher transepithelial resistance than Caco - 2 cells . The cell line was maintained in a 1 : 1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F12 medium . The rat basophilic leukemia cell line , RBL - 2H3 , was isolated and cloned in 1978 from Wistar rat basophilic cells , that were maintained as tumors 225 . The RBL cells are com - 26 monly used as a histamine - releasing cell line used in inflammation , allergy and immunologi - cal research 226 . Moreover , they resemble mucosal mast cell in many aspects and because of good secretion of β - hexosaminidase , an easily quantifiable protease that gives a measure - ment of total mast cell secretion . The cell line was maintained and cultured in Eagle’s mini - mum essential media ( EMEM ) . The Raji lymphoblast - like cell line was the first continuous human cell line of hematopoietic origin , established in 1963 from the left maxilla of an 11 year old Nigerian patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma 227 . It is a B lymphocyte which was originally used in the discovery and isolation of the Epstein - Barr virus 228 . We used this cell line in Co - culture with the CaCo - 2 clone 1 cells to establish FAE - like epithelium . It was maintained and cultured in RPMI - 1640 or in DMEM during co - culture settings . All culturing media were supplemented with 100U / mL penicillin , 100U / mL streptomycin and 1 . 5 % ( v / v ) HEPES ( all from Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum . Medium was changed every 2 - 3 days and all culturing was carried out at 37°C and 5 % CO2 in humidified incubators ( 95 % ) . Probiotic bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ( FP ) was initially classified as Fusobacterium prausnitzii , howev - er the new nomenclature was adopted in 2002 229 and FP species are now considered a ma - jor representative of Firmicutes phylum , Clostridium class , Ruminococcaceae family 230 . The FP reference strain , A2 - 165 , used in this paper was sequenced in 2010 and since then four additional FP species have been sequenced . Approximately 5 % of the total fecal microbiota in healthy adults but consist of FP and can increase to as much as 15 % in some individu - als 231 . The high fecal content of FP combined with its butyrate - producing capabilities 232 , 233 strongly suggests an important function in intestinal physiological function and homeostasis since butyrate plays a major role in gut physiology 234 . FP has been observed to be an un - derrepresented species in the microbiota of CD patients and have been suggested to have anti - inflammatory effects in mice 235 . Culture of FP is difficult because it is considered ex - tremely oxygen sensitive and has proven difficult to culture even under anaerobic condi - tions 231 . Increased intestinal permeability is common in IBD but the relationship between FP and intestinal barrier function had not been investigated . We chose to work with this strain to further evaluate FP’s potential as a probiotic bacterium . FP strain A2 165 ( DSM 176677 , DSMZ , Braunschweig , Germany ) was thus cultured anaerobically at 37° C in Wilkens - Chalgren anaerobe broth according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Bacterial cultures were plated to establish colony forming units ( CFU ) in relation to the measured optical den - sity ( OD ) . The supernatant was obtained after centrifugation of cultures with 10 9 - 10 10 bacte - ria / ml ( OD = 1 . 9 ) , which were frozen and then thawed directly before administration . 27 Ecologic ® 825 The probiotic mixture Ecologic © 825 ( Winclove Bio Industries , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) is a consist of nine viable and freeze - dried probiotic strains ; Bifidobacterium bifidum ( W23 ) , Bifidobacterium infantis ( W52 ) , Bifidobacterium lactis ( W51 ) , Lactobacillus acidophilus ( W22 ) , Lactobacillus casei ( W56 ) , Lactobacillus paracasei ( W20 ) , Lactobacillus plantarum ( W61 ) , Lactobacillus salivarius ( W24 ) and Lactococcus lactis ( W19 ) . All included strains are classified “group one” which means they have a long history of safe use and are not consid - ered to have negligible pathogenic effects . The bacteria are able to survive in the intestine and by balancing the microbiota they are assumed to positively influence the immune sys - tem . The main feature of this mixture is the possibility to induce anti - inflammatory cyto - kines like IL - 10 and TGF - β . Besides bacteria the mixture contains a small amount of inulin , fructo - oligosaccarides and a special mineral mixture as nutrition for the bacteria and to in - crease the activity after rehydration . The probiotic mixture was rehydrated to a concentration of 10 9 CFU / ml in sterile distilled water or in antibiotic - free medium before use . Techniques Permeability studies Ussing chamber This technique was first described in 1951 by Ussing and Zerhan 236 and then modified and simplified in 1988 by Grass 237 . The Ussing chamber makes it possible to study animal and human intestinal mucosal function . During the experiments we can assess the electrophysi - ology of the tissue , passage of different permeability markers , absorption and internaliza - tion of bacteria or permeability markers . Tissue arrives to the lab in oxygenated Krebs buff - er . In human and rat tissue , the external muscle layer and myenteric plexus are carefully removed and the mucosa ( consisting of the epithelium , the lamina propria and the muscu - laris mucosae ) mounted in the chamber . Mouse tissue is mounted without removal of ex - ternal muscle layer and myenteric plexus . Sections of intestinal epithelium were cut to ap - propriate size and mounted in modified Ussing chambers ( Harvard apparatus Inc . Holliston , MA , USA ) 237 . With different inserts made from x - ray film the exposed tissue area in the Ussing chamber can be varied . Rat tissues were mounted with inserts exposing 9 . 6 mm 2 tissue , while mouse and human tissue had 4 . 9 mm 2 and human biopsies had 1 . 8 mm 2 open - ings . Identification and localization of FAE was performed with a dissection microscope . When mounting FAE segments the tissue was carefully adjusted so patches covered the en - tire exposed surface area . The mucosal compartments were filled with 1 . 5 ml cold , 10nM mannitol Krebs buffer and the serosal compartments with 1 . 5 ml 10 nM glucose Krebs buff - er . The chambers were kept at 37°C and continuously oxygenated with a mixture of 95 % oxygen and 5 % carbon dioxide which also stir the buffer by the turbulence created when the oxygen bubbles pass through the chamber . Tissues were equilibrated for 20 - 40 minutes in the chambers to achieve steady state conditions in PD . After the equilibration time they were replenished with fresh 37°C buffers . The potential difference ( PD ) , short circuit current 28 ( Isc ) and transepithelial resistance ( TER ) were monitored using a four electrode system with a pair of Ag / AgCl - electrodes ( Radiometer , Copenhagen , Denmark ) with agar - salt ( 3M NaCl , 2 % agar ) bridges and a pair of current - giving platinum electrodes . The electrodes were cou - pled to a six channel electronic unit with a voltage controlled source . PD , Isc and TER were obtained as described by Karlsson et al 238 . Data sampling was computer controlled vi an A / D D / A converter board ( LAB NB , National Instruments , USA ) by a program developed in Lab View ( National Instruments ) . Every second minute , direct pulses of 1 . 5 , - 1 . 5 , 3 , - 3 and 0 µA with a duration of 235 ms were sent across the mucosal specimens and the voltage re - sponse was measured . In each measurement the mean voltage response of eight recordings was calculated . This procedure eliminates the influence of AC disturbances of 25 - 100 Hz . A linear least - squares fit was performed of the current ( I ) – voltage ( U ) pair relation : U = PD + TER x I . From the slope of the line , TER was obtained , and PD from the intersection of the voltage . In paper 2 , tissue conductance was then calculated by inverting the TER values . All parameters were calculated during a 60 min period . Tissue segments with a transepithelial PD higher than - 0 . 5mV were considered not viable and were discarded . At the end of the Ussing experiments , tissue viability was also assessed by adding 10 µM forskolin to the apical chamber , which should raise the levels of cyclic AMP with resultant active net ion transport in viable tissue , as assessed by an increase in Isc . Non - responsive tissues were discarded . Figure 9 . The Ussing chamber On the left is a photograph of an Ussing chamber and on the right a schematic drawing of an Ussing chamber . In the figures the placement of Ag / AgCl - electrodes and platinum electrodes can be seen . The gas inlet continuously stirs and oxygenates the buffers . The tissue is carefully mounted so it covers the surface are inbetween the chamber halves . 29 Experimental procedure After mounting tissue in Ussing chambers and adding ice - cold krebs buffer , chambers are placed on a 37°C heating block where agar - bridges , platinum electrodes and oxygen flow is connected . The tissue is left to equilibrate and heat up for 40 minutes . Before addition of permeability markers the Krebs buffer is changed to fresh 37°C buffer and the first samples collected . In experiments where blockers or modulators are used , the pretreatment is most often done during the equilibration step . Sampling is done every 30 minutes , but could be different depending on which markers are used . After each sampling replacement buffer is added to compensate for the lost volume . Permeability markers We use several different permeability markers , each with different properties and ways to permeate the mucosa . Horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) is a 45 kD protein antigen that under normal conditions is absorbed via macropinocytosis 92 . Detection of permeated HRP is per - formed with an ELISA based analysis and uptake into mucosa is also possible to detect with electron microscopy . 51 Chromuim - EDTA ( 51 Cr - EDTA ) is an inert probe that we use as a para - cellular marker . The strong binding of radioactive Cr to EDTA assures that Ca 2 + cannot bind and give EDTA detergent properties . Also , the strong bond between Cr and EDTA provide equal passage of the molecules . Analysis of 51 Cr - EDTA samples are done in a gamma coun - ter . Both HRP and 51 Cr - EDTA is widely used as permeability markers in Ussing chamber ex - periments . Markers are added to the mucosal side at 10 - 5 M HRP and 34µCi / ml 51 Cr - EDTA . Serosal samples of 300µl are collected at 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 and 120 min after start and the vol - ume replaced with Krebs buffer . Samples are analyzed in a gamma counter directly after the experiment and then frozen until HRP analysis is performed . In the papers included in this thesis we also use bacteria to study intestinal barrier function . Bacteria used are the non - pathogenic E . coli strains K12 and HB101 . The E . coli K12 that was used is a chemically killed FITC - conjugated bacterium that despite stopped reproduction has retained antigenicity . The other E . coli strain , HB101 , is a live bacterium expressing an incor - porated green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) . Since both strains are fluorescent analysis is per - formed on a fluorometer . Bacteria are added to the serosal side at a concentration of 10 8 CFU / ml and normally sampled after 60 and 120 minutes . Modulators In the first paper , tissue was exposed to VIP , VIP receptor antagonist and mast cell stabilizer on the serosal side of the Ussing chamber . Pretreatment during 20 minutes with either 1 µM VIP receptor antagonist or mast cell stabilizer ( 10 µM doxantrazole in rat tissue and 1µM ketotifen in human tissue ) . After pretreatment 0 . 1 µMol VIP was added to the serosal side and the experiment started by the addition of permeability markers . Replacement buffers to compensate for lost volume during sampling contained the correct concentrations of impli - cated modulators . At the end of the experiment 10 µM forskolin can be added to the apical 30 chamber to increase levels of cAMP and resulting in an increase in Isc . Tissues that do not respond to forskolin were considered non - viable and were discarded . Cell culture models With the cell lines and bacteria at our disposal we were able to isolate specific cell types of interest from in vivo systems and study in vitro . The possibility to culture CaCo - 2 or T84 epi - thelial cells on filters is a well - established in vitro model for the intestinal mucosa . In these experiments we could study passage of permeability markers and the effect of drugs , cyto - kines or bacterial factors under controlled conditions . Moreover , cell culture experiments also presented the possibility to co - culture epithelial cells and immune cells . We thus co - cultured epithelial cell lines with mast cell lines and B - cell lines . Co - culture FAE model In Paper I we employed a specialized model of co - culturing . The model was used to gener - ate FAE - like epithelia . It has previously been found by Kerneis et al . 239 , that co - culture of Peyer’s patch lymphocytes ( B - cells ) and intestinal epithelial cells can trigger epithelial cell conversion into an M - cell like phenotype . Briefly , using previously described modifications 240 - 242 , a special clone of CaCo - 2 ( clone 1 ) cells was grown on Matrigel - coated polycarbonate filters ( 3µm pore size ) for 14 to 17 days . The epithelia - covered filters were then transferred to wells containing Raji B cells and maintained for 4 - 6 days , until 10 % M cell like cells were generated . CaCo - 2 clone 1 cells were also grown without Raji B cells for the same period of time , giving us the possibility to compare FAE - like cell barrier properties to normal VE barrier properties . The barrier properties of epithelial cells can then be as - sessed with a special volt - ohmmeter ( Merck Millipore , Darmstadt , Germany ) by measuring TER or by adding permeability markers on the apical side and collecting samples on the ba - solateral side of the cell - covered filter . To verify the conversion to FAE like epithelium sev - eral experiments was conducted . First , TER measurements confirmed 10 % lower resistance in the co - culture FAE model compared to normal Caco - 2 cultures as previously show by Roberts et al 242 . Second , increased transcytosis of live Salmonella typhimurium over FAE compared to normal VE has previously been described 241 . This were confirmed in our model as well by adding live Salmonella apically to the filters and later sampling basolateral medi - um for plating on agar plates . Live colonies could then be quantified on the agar plates and revealed significantly higher passage over FAE - like epithelium . Filters were also fixed and analyzed in fluorescence - and scanning electron microscopy . Fluorescence microscopy re - vealed that more bacteria adhered to and invaded the FAE like epithelium while scanning electron microscopy revealed cells with M cell - like characteristics further confirming the transformation to M cells in the model . 31 Figure 10 . Co - culture FAE model The figure illustrates the culturing steps of the FAE co - culturing model . First epithelial cells are grown on filters . Second , co - culture of B - cells and epithelial cells to induce conversion to M cell - like cells . Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the transformation of model FAE as shown by sparse irregular microvilli on the apical surface indicating the presence of M cell - like cells . 32 Co - culture epithelial cells and mast cells In another model of co - culturing we used the epithelial cell line T84 grown on a Transwell filter with 3µm pores . The epithelial cells were grown to confluence and then the entire fil - ter insert was moved to a new well or plate , where we cultured a mast cell line , RBL - 2H3 . This in vitro experimental setup gave us the possibility to isolate these cell types and study the specific effects that mast cells can have on epithelial cells , and vice versa . Measure - ments of barrier properties were performed as described in the section above . In paper III we used this experimental model with T84 cells and RBL - 2H3 mast cells to study the effect probiotics may have on mast cells and epithelia . Immunohistochemistry and Immunoassays For microscopy , primary antibodies bind to the target protein and secondary antibodies conjugated with enzymes or fluorochromes bind the primary antibody . For enzyme conju - gated assays , enzyme substrate is added that gives rise to a specific color on the location where the antibodies have bound the target protein and can be visualized in normal light microscopy . Fluorochrome conjugated antibodies emits light of certain wavelengths de - pending on fluorochrome and are visualized with fluorescent or confocal microscopy . Immunoassays are used to find and quantify proteins in solutions . Briefly , the bottom of a plate well is coated with antibodies directed against the target protein . The solution is add - ed and target proteins adhere to the antibodies that are attached to the bottom . After a washing procedure a secondary set of antibodies are added that are conjugated with en - zymes . Enzyme substrate is then added for a certain time and the reaction is the stopped . The solutions then change color and depending on the amount of cleaved substrate the in - tensity of color also changes . Analysis and quantification is performed based on light ab - sorbance on a spectrophotometer . ( Figure 12 ) Figure 11 . Co - culture of mast cells and epithelial cells 33 In paper 1 , immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence was used to identify mast cells and to verify their VIP - receptor expression in rat and human tissue In paper 2 analysis of Myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) , 15 - deoxy - Δ prostaglandin J 2 ( 15d - PGJ 2 ) , PPAR - γ transcription factor and Rat mast cell proteinase ( RMCPII ) was performed . Briefly , all analyses were performed on tissue homogenates and analyzed with different absorbance based methods e . g . ELISA or Bradford’s protein assay . In paper 3 , levels of PPAR - γ transcription factor was performed with the same immunoassay kits as in Paper 2 but on cell lysates instead of tissue homogenates . To determine mast cell secretion the Beta - hexosaminidase release assay was used . Briefly , mast cells were stimu - lated and supernatant collected . The cells were then washed , lysed with a mild detergent and cell lysates was also collected . The supernatants and cell lysates was transferred to 48 - well plates and incubated with p - nitrophenyl N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosamine in 0 . 05M citrate buffer ( pH 4 . 5 ) for 1hr at 37°C . The reactions were then stopped by addition of 500ul of 0 . 05M sodium carbonate buffer ( pH 10 . 0 ) . The optical density was read and the data is ex - pressed as percentage of released beta hexosaminidase of total . Secretion assays of TNFα and 15d - PGJ 2 was performed on supernatants from cell cultures and analyzed in ELISA immunoassay kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions .

Immunoprocedures to identify target proteins The figure illustrates primary antibody binding to target proteins and secondary antibodies directed against the primary antibodies . The secondary antibodies are conjugated with fluo - rochromes for immunofluorescence and with enzymes for immunohistochemistry and im - munoassays . 34 Microscopy The microscope has played a key role in the exploration of the microcosmos ever since its invention approximately 400 years ago . The use of microscopy was quite extensive in my thesis . We used it to study cells in cell culture , to determine different types of epithelium in the mucosal tissue , to identify specific proteins or adherence and passage routes of bacte - ria . Several different kinds of microscopy have been used in the experiments , e . g . light mi - croscopy , fluorescence microscopy , confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy . Confocal laser scanning microscopy Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique used to increase optical resolut - ion and contrast of a microscope by using point illumination and a spatial pinhole to elimi - nate out - of - focus light in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane . The key feature of confocal microscopy is its ability to acquire in - focus images from selected depths , a pro - cess known as optical sectioning . Images are thus acquired from different optical sections and reconstructed with a computer , allowing three - dimensional reconstructions of objects . We used confocal microscopy when analyzing tissue stained with several fluorochromes e . g . mast cell and VIP receptors . The benefit of the optical sectioning enables increased optical resolution and contrast . Scanning electron microscopy A scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) was used in paper I for visualizing and verifying M cells in the in vitro FAE model . The SEM uses a focused beam of electrons to scan a sample surface . The electrons in the beam interact with the metal coating on the sample , reflect back and are then detected . The detected signals results in a picture showing the sample topography and composition . A SEM can achieve a resolution better than 1 nanometer . M cells lack the characteristic microvilli of the enterocyte and cells with that morphological feature could be seen using SEM on specimens from the in vitro FAE model ( Figure 10 ) . 35 Statistical analyses The distribution of values was tested with Kolmogorov - Smirnov test . When they displayed a symmetrical distribution they were considered parametric and further comparisons were done using Student’s t - test or one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Bonferro - ni’s correction for multiple comparison test or Tukey’s HSD test . Parametric values are pre - sented as mean ± SEM . Values of skewed distribution according to Kolmogorov - Smirnov test were analyzed using the Kruskal - Wallis test followed by the Mann - Whitney or Dunn’s multi - ple comparison tests . Non - parametric values are presented as median ± interquartile range . Throughout the thesis significance was denoted as : * when P < 0 . 05 , * * when P < 0 . 01 and * * * when P < 0 . 001 . Statistical calculations have been performed using GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Methodological considerations Ussing chambers Ex vivo techniques like Ussing chambers have several limitations . The limited viability of the tissue is one of the major concerns . As soon as a piece of intestine is resected it is almost as if a timer starts counting down with a limited time frame when experiments can be per - formed . To prolong the experimental window and get the most out of the tissue it is im - portant to immediately put it in cold 4°C Krebs buffer to slow down cell deterioration , while transporting the tissue to the lab . In our experience , obtained from studies outside of this thesis , it is possible to keep tissue on ice - cold oxygenated buffer up to 1 hour with main - tained ATP levels 243 , 244 . Normally the tissue is brought to our lab within 30 minutes . At the lab the external muscle of human or rat tissue is cautiously stripped from the mucosa , which is cut into appropriate - sized pieces and mounted in Ussing chambers . Our experiments rare - ly extended over a total of 4 hours including calibration time , but other groups have per - formed experiments up to 20 hours with FBS added to the Ussing chamber 243 , 245 . The tech - nique enabled us to do experiments on tissue from human intestine and unique human pa - tients . Moreover , human surgically resected tissue and biopsies gives us the advantage of having material from both small and large intestinal tissue , and also the possibility separate FAE from VE . However , disadvantages are the inability to control the exact region of donat - ed tissue , possible effects of medication and the use of control tissue from non - normals . In our case , control tissue is unaffected neighboring tissue of surgical resections from cancer patients . Still , we had the option to use human biopsies instead of surgically resected tissue with the benefit of having healthy volunteers as controls . With biopsies , a small disad - vantage is that we could not distinguish FAE from VE endoscopically , and we therefore had to refrain from comparing differences between the two techniques in experimental setups , where biopsies were used . We also observed a greater variation in permeability and elec - trophysiology in human tissue compared to animal tissue . This likely depended on a higher genetic diversity , different environmental and dietary backgrounds compared to animals , like mice and rats , which are often inbred strains living under exactly the same conditions and therefore give more consistent values . 36 In our current experimental setup of Ussing chambers the resistance is measured through the whole tissue . This gives us a value consisting of the mucosal and submucosal resistance . Since we were interested in the specific transepithelial resistance and not the total tissue resistance we tried to remove as much of the subepithelium as possible to minimize the influence on the TER . We are currently upgrading our systems to use square - pulse analysis for even more adequate assessment of the epithelial resistance 246 . Despite its drawbacks the Ussing chamber permits a wide range of experiments to be per - formed on human and animal tissue , enabling experiments that would otherwise be out of reach , ethically hard to motivate or very difficult to perform . Cell lines Working with cell lines gives us way to study specific cellular functions and mechanisms and to decrease the need of research animals . However , the limitations have also to be acknowledged when conclusions are drawn from the experiments . It is important to re - member that cell lines are often of cancerous origin and to carefully chosen to suit ones specific needs . Moreover , they tend to change their characteristics the older they become . It is therefore important to use cells with low passage numbers . In our experiments cell cul - tures have been used to complement and strengthen data found in animals or to study spe - cific details that would otherwise be difficult to address . The epithelial cell lines used in this thesis are both similar to normal enterocytes once they have been grown to confluence . The Caco - 2 clone1 cells were chosen for its ability to gener - ate M cell - like cells and the T84 because it is similar to colon epithelial cells with good TER properties . The choice of a mast cell line was harder , since there are also human mast cell lines , like HMC1 and LAD - 2 . However , since paper II was based on data from rats and the RBL - 2H3 cell line is a commonly used adherent rat mast cell line with excellent secretory properties , the choice to use it was fairly simple . RBL - 2H3 show many characteristics com - mon to both mucosal mast cells and basophils . They present similar responses to LPS but diverge from either cell type in their TLR expression 247 . While RBL - 2H3 resemble mucosal mast cells in many respects and display their basophilic lineage in others , their true nature probably lies somewhere in between . 37 RESULT SUMMARY Detailed descriptions of the results are given in the respective paper . Paper I : Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide regulates barrier function via mast cells in human intestinal follicle - associated epithelium and during stress in rats Rats were subjected to acute water aversion stress ( WAS ) to elucidate the role of VIP on mast cells during stress . Prior to stress they were injected with VIP - receptor blocker , mast cell stabilizer Doxantrazole ( DOX ) or NaCl as control . Ileal tissue was then excised and used for permeability studies in Ussing chamber experiments . Rat tissue was also exposed to DOX in Ussing chamber experiments and then treated with VIP to simulate stress in vitro . Human resected tissue from non - IBD patients were also pretreated with mast cell stabilizer , Keto - tifen ( KETO ) , then exposed to VIP giving us the possibility to compare rat results to human tissue . To study the direct effect of VIP on VE and FAE we also used an in vitro FAE model on Transwell filters . The results showed decreased stress effects in rat FAE after in vivo blocking by DOX or VIP - receptor blocker . The stress - induced increase in permeability to E . coli K12 , the value under stress versus the control , was significantly decreased ( p < 0 . 001 ) by DOX and the VIP - receptor blocker VIP 6 - 28 ( Figure P1 - 1 ) . In VE a similar pattern was seen but changes were not signifi - cant . 38 C on t r o l N a C l S t r e ss N a C l C on t r o l + V I P 6 - 28 S t r ess + V I P 6 - 28 C on t r o l + D O X S t r e s s + D O X C on t r o l N a C l S t r ess N a C l C on t r o l + V I P 6 - 28 S t r ess + V I P 6 - 28 C on t r o l + D O X S t r e s s + D O X 0 10 20 30 E . c o li K - 12 f l u x ( un i t s ) * * * # # # * FAE VE # # # In human tissue VIP induces mast cell and VIP receptor - dependent increases in permeability in ileum but not in colon ( Figure P1 - 2 ) . VIP exposure in the Ussing chambers more than doubled the E . coli uptake in VE and FAE , increases that were significantly blocked by KETO . A similar significant decrease in bacterial passage could be seen after pretreatment with a VIP - receptor blocker . Figure P1 - 1 .

Values are presented as median ± interquartile range . 40 In cell culture , there was an increased number of E . coli HS that had translocated over the FAE - like epithelium compared to normal epithelium . Also , conditioned medium from RBL - 2H3 mast cells stimulated with VIP significantly increased the transepithelial passage of bac - teria compared to that , which had only received VIP - containing medium . In conclusion , we found that stress - induced increase in ileal uptake of bacteria was prevent - ed by blocking mast cells or VIP - receptors . Our findings suggest that mast cells and VIP are of importance in the way stress affects intestinal barrier function . The results may be of sig - nificance for the pathogenesis in stress - related intestinal disorders and inspire suggestions on new therapeutic approaches . Paper II : Role of mast cells and PPARγ : Effects of probiotics on chronic stress - induced intestinal permeability in rats As displayed in paper I , mast cells are major effectors of stress - induces alterations of intes - tinal barrier function . Probiotics have positive effects on barrier function in chronic stress , but mechanisms are largely unknown . Our aim in paper II was to study the effects of probi - otics during stress and to study if a possible ameliorating effect could be mast cell - dependent . Normal and mast cell deficient rats were subjected to chronic WAS to elucidate the role of probiotics on mast cells during stress . Seven days prior to WAS a probiotic mixture consist - ing of nine different lactic acid bacteria was added to the diet of half of the animals . To de - termine dependence of the PPAR - γ pathway one group of rats receiving probiotics were also given daily injections with a specific PPAR - γ antagonist . Animal weights were recorded daily as well as the amount of fecal pellets during the daily 1 - h WAS . On the last day of stress the colon and mesenteric lymph nodes ( MLNs ) were harvested . Colonic tissue permeability was assessed in Ussing chambers and MLNs were cultured to determine bacterial translocation . There was a decrease in weight and an increase in propulsive activity during the daily stress session in the stressed rats . The increased latter was ameliorated by the probiotic mixture ( figure P2 - 1 ) . 41 In wild type rats the chronic stress resulted in increased permeability to 51 Cr - EDTA , HRP and passage of E . coli . Rats given probiotics had a significantly lower passage of all markers . Stressed , mast cell - deficient and probiotics - fed rats showed significantly higher passage of all permeability markers compared to wild type rats on probiotics . Wild type rats that re - ceived probiotics and daily injections with a PPAR - γ antagonist showed the same results as mast cell - deficient ( figure P2 - 2 ) . Figure P2 - 2 . Protective effects are mast cell and PPAR - γ dependent Probiotic - induced barrier protective effects are mast cell and PPAR - γ dependent . Eight mast cell deficient and 16 wild - type rats were subjected to water avoidance stress ( WAS ) or sham stress ( SS ) 1hr / day for 10 days . Seven days prior to the onset of stress , probiotics were added to the standard diet in all mast cell defi - cient and half of the wild - type animals . To determine dependence of PPAR - γ an additional 8 WAS subjected , probiotic - fed wild - type rats were injected daily with the specific PPAR - γ antagonist T0070907 . Colonic muco - sa was mounted in Ussing chambers to determine ( A ) 51 Cr - EDTA flux , ( B ) permeability to horseradish peroxi - dase ( HRP ) and ( C ) passage of live fluorescent E . coli HB 101 . Graphs show mean ± SEM . Data were collected from independently acquired sets of three tissue segments per rat . Comparisons were performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD . Figure P2 - 1 . Propulsive activity in stressed rats After seven days of standard or probiotic diet in wild type + / + rats were subjected to water avoidance stress ( WAS ) or sham stress for 10 consecutive days . Graph shows quantified fecal pellet expulsion during each of the 10 stress sessions . Comparisons were performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD . n = 8 in each group . 42 When investigating bacterial transport to MLNs , none of the sham - stressed ( SS ) rats , one of the stressed that received probiotic diet and all stressed rats on a standard diet had in - creased transport of potentially pathogenic bacteria ( table below ) . Group ( n = 8 ) Affected rats / rats in group CFU median ( range ) / g tissue SS , standard diet 0 / 8 0 WAS , standard diet 8 / 8 1 . 4x10 3 ( 2 . 3x10 3 - 2 . 3 * 10 4 ) SS , Probiotic diet 0 / 8 0 WAS , Probiotic diet 1 / 8 0 ( 0 - 1 . 2x10 2 ) Probiotic diet during WAS decreased tissue myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) and rat mast cell pro - teinase II ( RMCPII ) activity , but increased the PPAR - γ transcription factor and 15d - PGJ 2 ( Fig - ure P2 - 3 ) , compared to control rats on regular diet . Mast cell deficient probiotics fed rats showed significantly higher MPO activity and significantly lower levels of PPAR - γ transcrip - tion factor and 15d - PGJ 2 compared to stressed , probiotic - fed rats . In conclusion , the probiotic mixture used was effective in protecting the intestine against stress - induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and mucosal inflammation . The protecting ef - fect involves mast cells and a PPAR - γ - dependent mechanism , that was likely mediated though mast cell - derived 15d - PGJ 2 . These novel findings concerning the anti - inflammatory properties of probiotics could have therapeutic potential in the prevention of stress - induced gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS and decrease the number of relapses in IBD . Figure P2 - 2 . Colonic PPAR - γ activation and 15d - PGJ2 levels Thirty - two mast cell deficient ( Ws / Ws ) and 32 wild - type ( + / + ) rats were subjected to water avoidance stress ( WAS ) or sham stress ( SS ) 1hr / day for 10 days . Seven days prior to the onset of stress , probiotics were added to the standard diet in half of the animals . ( A ) PPAR - γ transcription factor in nuclear fractions , and ( B ) 15d - PGJ2 levels were determined in colonic mucosa . Graphs show means ± SEM . Analyses were run in duplicates . Comparisons were performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD . 43 Paper III : Probiotics modulate mast cell degranulation and reduce stress - induced barrier dysfunction in vitro To further investigate the mechanisms for the effects of probiotics on mast cells , we contin - ued our research using an in vitro model with cell lines . This gave us the benefit of isolating the role of the cell types of interest and to study the specific effects of probiotics in a con - trolled environment . The rat mast cell line RBL - 2H3 secretion was investigated after exposure to corticotropin - releasing factor ( CRF ) . The same probiotic mixture as in Paper II was used to study if it influ - enced the mast cell secretion . Mast cell release of β - hexosaminidase , TNFα and 15d - PGJ 2 was determined in different in vitro systems . Confluent monolayers of the T84 epithelial cell line were co - cultured with RBL - 2H3 mast cells and pretreated with probiotics before addi - tion of CRF to activate mast cells . Transepithelial resistance ( TER ) and microsphere permea - bility were measured over a 24 - h period . Monolayers were also pretreated with a specific PPAR - γ antagonist prior to treatment with probiotics to determine a role of PPAR - γ . CRF caused a dose - and time - dependent degranulation from RBLs ( figure P3 - 1x ) . Pretreat - ment with probiotics decreased mast cell secretion of β - hexosaminidase and TNFα , but an increase in 15d - PGJ 2 . No significant release of TNFα or 15d - PGJ 2 could be observed when mast cells were exposed to probiotics without addition of CRF . Neither did the non - pathogenic E . coli HB101 prevent CRF - induced activation of mast cells . PFA - killed probiotics did not exert any inhibitory effect on mast cell degranulation . Howev - er , sterile - filtered supernatants from probiotics significantly decreased CRF - induced activa - tion of mast cells release in a dose - dependent manner . Moreover , the release of TNFα de - creased and 15d - PGJ 2 increased in a dose dependent fashion in mast cells pre - stimulated with probiotic supernatant after exposure to CRF ( figure P3 - 2 ) , suggesting that a soluble factor released by live probiotics mediate the inhibitory effects on mast cell degranulation and modulation of the degranulation profile . We also examined each strain in the probiotic mixture and could observe that some bacterial strains had a higher effect on CRF - induced mast cell degranulation . Figure P3 - 1 . CRF induces dose dependent degranulation of RBL mast cells Figure showing that incubation of RBL mast cells with CRF at varying dosages ( 5μM , 1 μM , 100nM , 10nM ) causes a dose dependent degranulation of mast cells as shown by the release of beta hexosaminidase . Data are mean±SEM ; n = 6 preparations from 2 experi - ments ; A23187 was included as a positive con - trol ( 5 μM ) . Comparisons were performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD . 44 When co - culturing RBL - 2H3 mast cells in the bottom of a Transwell chamber with a conflu - ent monolayer of T84 cells on the filter , addition of CRF decreased the transepithelial re - sistance and increased the passage of fluorescent microspheres . In experiments without mast cells CRF did not have any effect . To test the effect of probiotics in this experimental system probiotics were added to the apical side of the T84 cells one hour prior to CRF - stimulation . Probiotic pretreatment caused decreased release of β - hexosaminidase and TNFα as wells as increased levels of 15d - PGJ 2 . Furthermore , the positive effect was also seen as an increased TER and decreased microsphere permeability ( figure P3 - 3 ) . Similar results were observed in experiments where pretreatment with a filter - sterilized probiotic superna - tant was used instead of the probiotic mixture . The positive effect on the epithelium could be inhibited by pretreatment with a selective PPAR - γ blocker . Figure P3 - 3 . Mast cells contribute to probiotic - induced barrier protective effects Filter - grown T84 monolayers were pretreated for 1h with probiotics and either exposed to conditioned medium of CRF activated RBL cells or co - cultured with RBL cells , which were subsequently activated with 100nM CRF . Bar graphs show that pretreatment with probiotics attenuates the deleterious effects in stress - induced epithelial barrier dysfunction as determined by ( A ) an amelioration of the mast cell - induced drop in transepithelial re - sistance ( TER ) and ( B ) increase in microsphere flux after activation of mast cells . Data are mean ± SEM ; n = 6 prepa - rations from 2 experiments . Comparisons were performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD . Figure P3 - 2 .

Comparisons were performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD . 45 To test whether the barrier - protective effects were PPAR - γ dependent , PPAR - γ transcription factor levels were measured in confluent plastic grown T84 cells stimulated with condi - tioned media from CRF - activated mast cells cultured with or without probiotics or probiotic supernatant . The results showed a significant increase in the PPAR - γ transcription factor concentration after stimulation with conditioned media from CRF - activated mast cells pre - treated with probiotics . However , a smaller increase was also seen after simulation with probiotics and conditioned media from CHR activated mast cell but not from probiotic su - pernatant . In conclusion , the in vitro data confirms our previous findings ( paper II ) and gives more in - formation on the mechanisms by which mast cells may be involved in the protective effects of probiotics . The mast cell function was modulated by probiotics and their soluble factors to release less TNFα , and more 15d - PGJ 2 . This resulted in PPAR - γ activation in epithelial cells and maintenance of epithelial barrier function despite CRF - induced mast cell activation . Modulation of mast cell function by probiotics could have important implications for the treatment of stress - induced gastrointestinal disorders . Paper IV : Faecalibacterium prausnitzii supernatant improves intestinal barrier function in mice with DSS colitis To study if probiotic bacteria could ameliorate inflammatory conditions , we used a mouse model with chemically induced colitis . Instead of applying the probiotic mixture used in the two previous manuscripts , we chose to work with a commensal bacterium , Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ( FP ) , which has been proven to be underrepresented in the microflora of Crohn’s disease patients 235 . Mice were divided in to two groups and one of them received 3 % DSS in their drinking water during five days to induce acute colitis . From the third day of experiment and the following seven days some mice received a daily gavage with supernatant from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and controls only culture broth . The mice were weighed daily , and on the last day of experiment ileum and colon tissue were taken for permeability studies in Ussing cham - bers . Tissue was also saved for Western blot analyses of tight junction proteins . There was a more rapid recovery after DSS - induced colitis in mice receiving FP , but the ter - minal weights were not significantly increased compared to those which received only broth . Significant differences could , however , be seen when comparing colon lengths as a proxy for inflammation . The Ussing chamber permeability experiments showed a significant increase in 51 CrEDTA passage in ileum after DSS treatment . This effect was significantly smaller in mice , that had received FP supernatant ( Figure P4 - 1 ) . In colon tissue no significant differences could be observed . Neither were there any differences in either ileal or colonic transmucosal passage of E . coli K12 . 46 FAE P a pp 51 C r - E D T A ( 10 - 6 c m / s ) C on t r o l + b r o t h D SS + b r o t h D SS + F P C on t r o l + F P D SS + F P + T 0070907 0 2 4 6 8 10 * * # VE P a pp 51 C r - E D T A ( 10 - 6 c m / s ) C on t r o l + b r o t h D SS + b r o t h D SS + F P C on t r o l + F P D SS + F P + T 0070907 0 2 4 6 8 10 * * # # Colon P a pp 51 C r - E D T A ( 10 - 6 c m / s ) C on t r o l + b r o t h D SS + b r o t h D SS + F P C on t r o l + F P D SS + F P + T 0070907 0 2 4 6 8 10 Western blots of the tight junction proteins claudin - 1 and - 2 demonstrated higher expres - sions of both proteins in colon from DSS - colitis mice . Still , a densitometric analysis only re - vealed a tendency ( P = 0 . 06 ) to a higher expression of claudin - 1 in DSS mice compared to controls . Claudin - 2 expression was also numerically higher in the groups that had received DSS compared to the control group , but not to a significant degree ( P = 0 . 1 ) ( figure P4 - 2 ) .

These findings accentuate the potential efficacy of FP in the treatment of IBD . Further studies are , however , required for a more detailed definition of the processes that underlie these results .

Mast cells , probiotics and stress in intestinal permeability The figure illustrates the central role of mast cells in the regulation of intestinal function presented in this thesis . The yellow arrow between the neuron and the mast cell represents the effect stress can have on mast cells via VIP and CRF . The green arrows represent the effect probiotics can have on mast cells , epithelia and the luminal micro - environment . An effect mediated through an unidentified soluble factor . The blue arrow represents the effect mast cells can have on epithelial cells , the apical junctional complex and intestinal permeability via mast cell degranulation of 15d - PgJ 2 and TNFα . DISCUSSION Mast cell activation has been implicated in many types of disturbances of gut function 111 . Both direct and indirect mechanisms relevant to disease characteristics have been pro - posed , such as changes in epithelial barrier function and / or activation of adaptive or innate immune responses . Mast cells also function as mediators between the inflammatory cells and the enteric nervous system . Several cell types are affected by the inflammatory envi - ronment and upon activation they release mediators which affect the gastrointestinal neu - romuscular and secretory functions . The aim of this thesis was to increase the understanding of mast cell activation , their effects on the regulation of the intestinal barrier function during stress , and how they can be affect - ed by probiotics . Mast cells have had a central role in this thesis . The results show that mast cells have an active role to play in the effect stress has on intestinal permeability , and the positive effects of probiotics are also partly mediated via mast cells . I will continue to discuss our findings on mast cells in relation to stress and probiotics below . A summarizing illustration showing the different main components of this thesis and their relation to each other are shown in figure 13 . 48 Stress Stress is a common experience in daily life , and that stress can result in gastrointestinal dis - orders is well established 248 , 249 . Stressful life events worsen the clinical course of CD and prolonged stress raises the number of relapses in UC patients 250 . The studies included in this thesis have employed two similar stress models . In paper 1 , acute WAS was used and in pa - per 2 a model of chronic WAS . In acute WAS , the rats were exposed to 1 - hour WAS and in chronic stress they were subjected to 1 - hour of WAS for ten consecutive days . WAS in rats is a widely used model of psychological stress and it has been shown , that this chronic form of stress causes a prolonged intestinal barrier dysfunction 45 , 218 . In the ex vivo experiments with Ussing chambers and in vitro in cell cultures we used CRF to simulate stress . An increase in mucosal permeability could allow antigens and bacteria to penetrate the intestinal barrier , thereby causing mucosal inflammation . Mucosal barrier integrity is known to be affected by stress under experimental conditions by routes involving mast cells 251 . However , it is more difficult to find good models for direct effects of stress on the intestinal barrier in humans . There are many ethical and practical complications but also methodological problems . In this thesis we simulated stress on human tissue in Ussing chambers ex vivo . However , ongo - ing experiments in our lab are testing a model , where healthy individuals can be subjected to experimental stress under controlled conditions before acquiring intestinal biopsies . Reports on the involvement of VIP in stress - induced , mucosal permeability changes are scarce . Even so , in a co - culture model of human submucosal neuronal network and human colonic monolayers , the paracellular permeability was decreased by electrical stimulation of submucosal neurons and reproduced by a VIP peptide 252 . Interestingly , the effects were blocked by VIP - receptor antagonists and the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin . When broadening the view to include effects of VIP in general , the findings are divergent . Several studies have revealed that VIP has anti - inflammatory and barrier - enhancing properties 253 - 255 , which ame - liorate experimental colitis 253 , 255 and lower paracellular permeability 252 , 256 , 257 . However , other studies have shown that VIP also exerts some pro - inflammatory effects . For example , it may promote development of inflammation - associated Th17 cells in response to antigens 258 , 259 and decrease IL - 8 production in monocytes activated by inflammatory sti - muli 260 . Our novel findings , which might seem controversial , suggest that VIP acts via mast cells and is important in regulation of ileal barrier function during stress . A notable differ - ence is that previous studies were performed on mouse colon or cell cultures . Our experi - ments also showed differences between stress and VIP - effects depending on the anatomical region , i . e . colon vs . ileum . The effect of VIP might thus be dependent on species , intestinal localization , underlying pathological conditions and barrier characteristics . 49 In our experiments , VIP had no effect on the paracellular permeability in humans . However , the transcellular passage was significantly increased by VIP , which could be inhibited by VIP - receptor blockers . These findings point to different mechanisms in the regulation of paracel - lular and transcellular permeability by VIP , and further illustrate the diverse actions of the peptide . The interaction between mast cells and VIP in barrier function has not previously been re - ported . In paper 1 , the increased permeability caused by acute stress and VIP , respectively , was totally abolished by mast cell stabilization or a VIP - receptor blocker , indicating that cross - talk between VIP neurons and mast cells is highly important in Ileal FAE and VE . An interaction between VIP , mast cells and the epithelium was also confirmed by the co - culture model , showing increased bacterial passage by VIP - stimulated mast cell supernatant , but no effects by VIP alone . Furthermore , the close interaction of VIP and mast cells was also con - firmed by IHC showing both VIP - receptor 1 and 2 expressions on intestinal mast cells for both rat and human FAE tissue . Previous publications have identified VIP - receptors on por - cine mast cells 261 and on the human mast cell line HMC - 1 262 . One article has also shown ac - tivation by VIP on human skin mast cells , indicating the presence of VIP - receptors on skin mast cells 263 . The novel findings on the effects of VIP on intestinal permeability add to the previous knowledge on how intestinal permeability can be affected by CRF , acetylcholine and substance P 264 . Probiotics The composition of the intestinal microbial flora has been suggested to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IBD 235 , 265 . A decrease in the diversity of microbiota in IBD patients has also previously been documented 266 , 267 . Consequently there is increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of microflora modifications . Probiotics are live microorganisms , which when administered in adequate amounts , might confer a health benefit on the host 268 . En - dogenous probiotic bacteria of the gut , such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus , seem to play a vital role in maintaining the intestinal mucosal barrier 201 , 269 . Probiotic bacteria have also been shown to modulate intestinal epithelial barrier function and cytokine secretion through effects on epithelial cells and via modulation of the NF - κB and PPAR pathways 248 , 270 . Furthermore , certain commensal microbes have been suggested to inhibit mast cell degran - ulation 271 . Probiotics can be composed of mono - strain , multi - strain or multi - species bacteria depend - ing on the desired purpose , function and effect . In this thesis , we have used a multi - species probiotic mixture ( paper 2 & 3 ) and the supernatant from a single strain ( paper 4 ) . The pro - biotic mixture Ecologic® 825 was developed to extend remission time in IBD patients . The bacteria were chosen on three criteria : 1 . compete with pathogens being associated with IBD ( C . difficile , E . coli ) ; 2 . Improve the barrier function and 3 . Induce the production of anti - inflammatory cytokines . A recent publication from our group using this specific mixture of probiotics has shown restored mucosal barrier properties in patients with chronic 50 pouchitis 272 . One drawback of working with a mixture of probiotics is that it is harder and time consuming to study the specific effects of each strain . An example is part of paper 3 , where we tested CRF - induced mast cell secretion on RBL - 2H3 after pretreatment with each of the probiotic bacteria included in Ecologic® 825 . The results showed decreased secretion in five of the nine strains included . In paper 4 we therefore decided to take a different ap - proach . Not only did we choose to work with one bacterium , Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , but since it is strictly anaerobic , we also decided to only use supernatant . Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was chosen because Sokol et . al . 235 found an underrepresentation of this strain in the fecal microbiota in CD patients compared to healthy subjects . In the same publication , they also showed that FP had anti - inflammatory properties and that the supernatant from FP had almost the same positive effect as the bacteria . The appealing idea here was that some soluble factor in the supernatant confers the probiotic effect . Moreover , treatment of patients with a soluble factor would be easier and probably safer than an introduction of a plethora of bacteria in an inflamed intestine . Interestingly , we found that supernatant of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii enhanced intestinal barrier function by affecting paracellular permeability . Although probiotic effects are extremely interesting to study and currently a hot topic , a warning should be issued when taking the steps from animal experiments to human trials . As an example , when Besselink et al . 273 gave probiotic profylaxis to patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis it resulted in more than a two - fold increase in mortality compared to placebo . Previous studies have shown that the production of mast cell mediators can be modulated by other factors found at inflammatory sites , such as IFN - γ 274 , PGE 2275 and IL - 10 276 . In our experiments from paper 2 and 3 , probiotic treatment increased mast cell release of 15 - deoxy - Δ prostaglandin J 2 ( 15d - PGJ 2 ) . 15d - PGJ 2 is derived from PGD 2 and mainly released by mast cells 277 . It is also a high - affinity ligand to PPAR - γ 278 . Activation of PPAR - γ by endoge - nous agonists , such as 15d - PGJ 2 , or synthetic agonists can be considered as a pathway to halt the inflammatory response . PPAR - γ , exerts anti - inflammatory effects by interfering with the activity of inflammatory transcription factors , such as Activator Protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) , Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription ( STAT ) , and nuclear factor κB ( NF - κB ) 279 . In paper 2 and 3 we provide novel in vivo and in vitro evidence , that stress - induced eleva - tion in mucosal 15d - PGJ 2 is mast cell dependent and that oral feeding of rats with probiotics further enhances the levels of 15d - PGJ 2 after exposure to stress . The stress - induced increase in 15d - PGJ 2 seemed to run parallel with the activation of PPAR - γ . However , the fact that PPAR - γ activity was increased after probiotic treatment of sham - stressed and mast cell - deficient animals indicates that probiotic - induced PPAR - γ activation was not solely depend - ent on 15d - PGJ 2 secretion from mast cells . This may be explained by a previous work show - ing production of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotics , which is known to be a PPAR - γ lig - and 280 . Degradation of PPAR - γ occurs also through the ubiquitin - proteasome system 281 and probiotics have previously been shown to reduce cellular proteasome activity 202 , 282 . It is 51 therefore possible that probiotics decrease the degradation of PPAR - γ and thereby prolongs its activity . In our experiments , we could also see that treatment with the PPAR - γ antagonist blocked the positive effect that probiotics exerted on intestinal permeability . Our data thus suggest that mast cells may contribute to the protective effects of probiotics in stress - induced mucosal dysfunction . Concluding remarks The research presented in this thesis contributes to the understanding of the role of mast cells and probiotics during stress . We present novel data from human , rat and cell culture experiments showing how the neu - ropeptide VIP acts via mast cells to increase intestinal permeability . Furthermore , we de - scribe how probiotics modulate mast cell - mediator release to a more barrier protective profile , resulting in amelioration of stress - induced epithelial barrier dysfunction being medi - ated by a PPAR - γ dependent pathway . Finally , we show that supernatant from Faecalibacte - rium prausnitzii enhances the intestinal barrier function by affecting the paracellular perme - ability . The findings in this thesis strengthen the theory that mast cells have an important immune - regulatory role on intestinal barrier function and are important players in the brain - gut axis . We also show that probiotics live up to their definition in that they “can confer a health benefit on the host” during modeling of stress and colitis . Our results could be of importance for understanding the pathogenesis of stress - related intestinal disorders and give clues to new therapeutic approaches targeting mast cells or their receptors . In particular , further research into the interaction between mast cells with CRF and VIP seems promising . The results also show a positive effect of probiotics on intes - tinal permeability during stress and intestinal inflammation , which strengthens the potential use of probiotics in clinical practice . Important questions to continue to study are if combi - nations of several strains of probiotic bacteria are better than single - strain preparations , and if we should try to isolate soluble factors produced by probiotic strains . 52 CONCLUSIONS • Stress effects on ileal permeability can be mimicked in vitro by VIP . These effects are abolished by blocking VIP - receptors and by mast cell stabilizers . • Human mucosal mast cells express receptors for VIP , and VIP - containing cells and neu - rons are found in close proximity to mast cells . • Mast cells , acting via a PPAR - γ dependent pathway , contribute to the beneficial effects of probiotics on chronic stress - induced mucosal dysfunction in rats . • Probiotics modulate mast cell - mediator release to a more barrier - protective profile , resulting in amelioration of stress - induced epithelial barrier dysfunction , mediated by a PPAR - γ dependent pathway . • The supernatant of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii enhances the intestinal barrier func - tion by affecting the paracellular permeability , and may thereby attenuate the severity of DSS - induced colitis in mice . 53 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The work of this thesis has been a collaborative effort and would not have been possible without the contribution , help and support from several persons .
