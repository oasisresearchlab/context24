We have identiﬁed a form of PGC - 1 a ( PGC - 1 a 4 ) that results from alternative promoter usage and splicing of the primary transcript . PGC - 1 a 4 is highly expressed in exercised muscle but does not regulate most known PGC - 1 a targets such as the mitochon - drial OXPHOS genes . Rather , it speciﬁcally induces IGF1 and represses myostatin , and expression of PGC - 1 a 4 in vitro and in vivo induces robust skeletal muscle hypertrophy . Importantly , mice with skeletal muscle - speciﬁc transgenic expression of PGC - 1 a 4 show increased muscle mass and strength and dramatic resistance to the muscle wasting of cancer cachexia . Expression of PGC - 1 a 4 is preferentially induced in mouse and human muscle during resis - tance exercise . These studies identify a PGC - 1 a pro - tein that regulates and coordinates factors involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy . INTRODUCTION PGC - 1 a is a transcriptional coactivator that controls the expres - sion of genes involved in oxidative metabolism . PGC - 1 a was originally identiﬁed as a coactivator of PPAR g in brown adipose tissue , but it is enriched in many tissues that are active in oxida - tive metabolism , such as heart , skeletal muscle , and the fasted liver . Muscle PGC - 1 a is induced by exercise in both mice and humans ( Short et al . , 2003 ) . When expressed in skeletal muscle in vivo , PGC - 1 a causes many of the changes associated with endurance training , including mitochondrial biogenesis , ﬁber - type switching , stimulation of fatty acid oxidation , angiogenesis , and resistance to muscle atrophy ( Arany , 2008 ) . This reprogram - ming of muscle results in increased muscle endurance . Genetic loss of PGC - 1 a in murine muscle causes glucose intolerance , especially on a high - fat diet ( Choi et al . , 2008 ; Handschin et al . , 2007 ) . Elevated PGC - 1 a in muscle does not protect against insulin resistance stimulated by a high - fat diet in young mice ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) but dramatically protects against the sarcope - nia , obesity , and diabetes that accompany aging ( Wenz et al . , 2009 ) . Although PGC - 1 a is induced in exercise and has remark - able effects on muscle endurance , it has no clear - cut effects on either muscle size or strength . Here , we identify a transcript from the Pgc - 1 a gene that is expressed abundantly in skeletal muscle , particularly in the setting of resistance training in mice and humans . This protein , termed PGC - 1 a 4 , does not regulate the same set of genes induced by PGC - 1 a but rather regulates the IGF1 and myostatin pathways , both of which are known regulators of muscle size and strength ( Florini , 1987 ; McPherron et al . , 1997 ) . This results in muscle hypertrophy and increased strength . Remarkably , mice with skeletal - muscle - speciﬁc trans - genic expression of PGC - 1 a 4 show a dramatic resistance to the muscle wasting of cancer cachexia . Taken together , these data suggest that PGC - 1 a 4 integrates resistance training with a gene program of muscle hypertrophy , which results in several impor - tant health beneﬁts . RESULTS Identiﬁcation , Characterization , and Expression of Alternative Isoforms of PGC - 1 a We and others have shown that transcription of the Pgc - 1 a gene can be driven by two distinct promoter regions ( Chinsomboon et al . , 2009 ; Yoshioka et al . , 2009 ) . One is located immediately 5 0 of the known exon 1 ( proximal promoter ) , and another ( alterna - tive promoter ) is located (cid:2) 13 kb upstream ( Figure 1A ) .

We cloned four full - length messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) ; one of these corresponds to the previously described PGC - 1 a ( hereafter referred to as PGC - 1 a 1 ) and originates exclusively from the proximal promoter . The other three transcripts ( hereafter referred to as PGC - 1 a 2 , a 3 , and a 4 ) result from alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing of the Pgc - 1 a gene ( Figures 1A and S1C ) . The new isoforms encode signiﬁcantly different proteins ( Figure 1B ) . PGC - 1 a 2 and a 3 have distinct ﬁrst exons but have the same remaining exon / intron structure ( Figure S1C ) ; this results in two new proteins with overall similar domain structure but discrete N termini ( Figure 1C ) .

See also Figure S2 . 41 . 9 and 41 . 0 kDa , respectively . PGC - 1 a 4 shares the same alternative exon1 with PGC - 1 a 2 ( and therefore the same N terminus , Figure 1C ) , but its mRNA struc - ture is different in that it contains a 31 nucleotide insertion between exons 6 and 7 , which generates a premature stop codon ( Figures 1A , 1B , and S1C ) . PGC1 a 4 is predicted to encode 266 amino acids , a protein of 29 . 1 kDa . The different alternative ﬁrst exons generate different N termini that seem to signiﬁ - cantly affect protein accumulation ( Fig - ures 1C , 1D , and S1B ) . With the use of speciﬁc qPCR probes , we determined total PGC - 1 a mRNA content ( targeting exon 2 , which is present in all forms ) or the expression of each individual isoform in an array of mouse tissues ( Figure 2A ) . In fed liver , PGC - 1 a 1 levels approach total PGC - 1 a content , and no signiﬁcant alternative isoform expression is observed ( Figure 2A ) . However , in skeletal muscle , heart , and brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) , all isoforms are expressed at comparable levels and represent a signiﬁcant part of total PGC - 1 a mRNA . Figures S2A and S2B show PGC - 1 a isoform protein levels in superﬁcial white quadriceps ( glycolytic , low PGC - 1 a 1 levels ) and tibialis anterior ( oxidative , high PGC - 1 a 1 levels ) muscle , as well as liver , kidney , and BAT . Primary myotubes treated with the known PGC - 1 a inducer forskolin show high levels of all iso - forms ( Figure S2C ) . Similarly , cold exposure induces expression of all PGC - 1 a variants in BAT ( Figures S2D and S2E ) . These results show that total PGC - 1 a mRNA content includes signiﬁ - cant levels of each isoform , which can be increased in vitro and in vivo by known inducers of the Pgc - 1 a gene .

PGC - 1 a 4 Regulates a Discrete Gene Program in Primary Myotubes Differentiated primary myotubes were transduced with adeno - virus expressing different PGC1 a isoforms . Figure 2B shows a heat map generated by comparing the gene expression proﬁle of cells receiving each PGC - 1 a isoform , compared to green ﬂuo - rescent protein ( GFP ) alone . Interestingly , PGC - 1 a 1 and PGC - 1 a 4 drive many changes in gene expression that are distinct from each other ; only 98 genes were coregulated by both PGC - 1 a 1 and PGC - 1 a 4 ( Figure 2C ) . PGC - 1 a 2 and 3 seem to affect the expression of only a very small set of genes ( 110 and 69 gene IDs , respectively ) . The functions of PGC - 1 a 2 and a 3 remain under investigation . Importantly , expression of PGC - 1 a 4 in myotubes did not affect the regulation of many classic PGC - 1 a 1 targets , including CytC ( cytochrome C ) , CoxVb ( cyto - chrome c oxidase subunit Vb ) , Glut4 ( glucose transporter type 4 ) , CPT1 ( carnitine palmitoyltransferase - I ) , MCAD ( medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase ) , and PDGFb ( platelet - derived growth factor B ) ( Figure 2D ) . Several other known PGC - 1 a target genes were induced by PGC - 1 a 4 expression , though to a much lesser extent than upon expression of PGC - 1 a 1 ( Figure 2D ) , including ERR a , PDK4 ( pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase , iso - enzyme 4 ) , and VEGFa ( vascular endothelial growth factor A ) . These results strongly suggest distinct functions for PGC - 1 a 1 and PGC1 a 4 . Expression of PGC - 1 a 4 Speciﬁcally Induces IGF1 and Represses Myostatin Gene Expression Pathway analysis of the microarray data identiﬁed cell mor - phology , growth , and proliferation and IGF1 signaling as the top pathways predicted to be under PGC - 1 a 4 regulation ( data not shown ) . From quantitative real - time PCR , we conﬁrmed that PGC - 1 a 4 ( but not a 1 ) speciﬁcally induces expression of IGF1 ( 3 . 7 - fold ) while minimally affecting IGF2 ( 1 . 5 - fold ) levels ( Figure 2E ) . The expression levels of some members of the IGF - binding protein ( IGFBP ) family were also selectively affected by PGC - 1 a 4 expression . IGF1 is among the best - known activa - tors of skeletal muscle hypertrophy ( Adams , 2002 ) . PGC - 1 a 4 expression also reduced mRNA levels of myostatin , a powerful , negative regulator of muscle size in rodents and humans ( Fig - ure 2F ) ( Lee , 2004 ; McPherron et al . , 1997 ) , as well as the tran - script levels of its receptors ACVRIIa and ACVRIIb ( 40 % and 30 % , respectively ) . The levels of ACVRIb remained unaffected by expression of either PGC - 1 a 1 or PGC1 a 4 , whereas both iso - forms repress follistatin expression ( Figure 2F ) . Taken together , these results indicate that PGC - 1 a 4 controls the expression of genes in two important pathways for regulating skeletal muscle size . PGC - 1 a 4 Expression Leads to Powerful Myotube Hypertrophy Myotubes expressing PGC - 1 a 4 appear signiﬁcantly larger than those expressing GFP control or PGC - 1 a 1 ( Figure 3A ) , with a 2 - fold elevation in the ratio of total protein to genomic DNA ( Figure 3B ) . We observed no signiﬁcant differences in fusion of myoblasts expressing GFP or the different PGC - 1 a isoforms , as assessed by the number of nuclei per myotube ( Figure S3A ) . Importantly , the PGC - 1 a 4 - dependent increase in myotube size and protein accumulation could be inhibited by an IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R ) inhibitor ( BMS - 754807 ; Dinchuk et al . , 2010 ) ( Figures 3C and S3B ) . Under the same conditions , no signiﬁcant changes in total protein accumulation were observed in cells expressing GFP or PGC - 1 a 1 . Although we observed an increase in expres - sion of the myogenic transcription factors Myf5 and 6 , the levels of MyoD and myogenin were only minimally affected ( Figure 3D ) . Small effects were also observed in the expression of the atrophy - related genes MuRF - 1 and atrogin - 1 / MAFbx ( Figure 3D ) ( Bodine et al . , 2001 ; Gomes et al . , 2001 ) . Both PGC - 1 a isoforms show a predominantly nuclear localization in skeletal myotubes ( Figure S3C ) . Taken together , these results clearly suggest a role for PGC - 1 a 4 in the regulation of myotube size and protein content , mediated ( at least in part ) by IGF1 . PGC - 1 a 4 Loss of Function Blunts Skeletal Muscle Cell Hypertrophy in Culture To evaluate the requirement for PGC - 1 a 4 in a cellular model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy , we developed an isoform - speciﬁc short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) . As shown in Figure S3D , PGC - 1 a 4 shRNA efﬁciently reduces PGC - 1 a 4 mRNA levels in trans - duced myotubes while not affecting PGC - 1 a 1 . Myotube hyper - trophy was induced by treatment with the b - adrenergic agonist clenbuterol ( McMillan et al . , 1992 ) ; this resulted in robust hyper - trophy ( Figure 3E ) accompanied by a 5 - fold increase in endoge - nous PGC - 1 a 4 levels and also resulted in a 1 . 9 - fold increase in protein / DNA ratio ( Figures S3D and 3E ) . No changes were ob - served in PGC - 1 a 1 levels with clenbuterol treatment . However , shRNA - mediated reduction in PGC - 1 a 4 levels blunted clen - buterol - induced myotube hypertrophy ( Figure 3E ) and protein ( C ) Protein accumulation normalized by genomic DNA content in myotubes expressing GFP control , PGC - 1 a 1 , or PGC - 1 a 4 and treated with the IGF1R inhibitor BMS - 754807 . Myotubes were transduced as described in ( A ) and treated with 5 nM BMS - 754807 . At the end of 36 hr , cells were processed for total protein or DNA quantiﬁcation . ( D ) Analysis of gene expression for markers of myogenic differentiation . Experiments were performed as described in ( A ) , and gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real - time PCR by using primers speciﬁc to the indicated genes .

( F ) ChIP of DNA regions associated with Acetyl - H3K9 . Myotubes expressing GFP alone or with PGC - 1 a 4 were processed for ChIP .

Cell 151 , 1319 – 1331 , December 7 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1323 accumulation , compared to a scrambled control ( Figure S3E ) . These results show that PGC - 1 a 4 is required for myotube hyper - trophy in this cellular model . Loss of Estrogen - Related Receptors a or g Does Not Affect PGC - 1 a 4 - Mediated Myotube Hypertrophy The estrogen - related receptors are master drivers of OXPHOS gene expression under PGC - 1 a 1 coactivation ( Gigue ` re , 2008 ) . We investigated whether myotubes genetically deﬁcient in ERR a or ERR g could still support PGC - 1 a 4 function . Differenti - ated myotubes were transduced with adenovirus expressing GFP control or PGC - 1 a 4 , and even in the absence of ERR a , PGC - 1 a 4 was still able to induce robust myotube hypertrophy ( Figure S4F ) ; both IGF1 and myostatin genes were regulated as previously observed in wild - type cells ( Figure S3G ) . Similar results were obtained with ERR g - deﬁcient myotubes ( data not shown ) . In agreement with these results , and in contrast to PGC - 1 a 1 , PGC - 1 a 4 did not coactivate ERR a function in lucif - erase assays using two different reporters for ERR - mediated transactivation ( Figure S3H ) . These results indicate that PGC - 1 a 4 does not coactivate ERR function , which likely contributes to the lack of effect on OXPHOS gene expression . PGC - 1 a 4 Expression Induces Changes in Histone Modiﬁcations near the IGF1 and Myostatin Genes The PGC - 1s have been shown to associate with other coregula - tory complexes to promote chromatin remodeling and enhance transcription of target genes . One such complex is anchored by the histone acetyltransferase CBP / p300 , which mediates histone tail acetylation as a mark for positive gene regulation ( Ogryzko et al . , 1996 ) . Because IGF1 gene transcription is en - hanced by PGC - 1 a 4 , we performed chromatin immunoprecipi - tation ( ChIP ) experiments by using an anti - acetyl - H3K9 antibody to identify potential IGF1 gene enhancer regions . We thus identiﬁed three regions of DNA where association with acetyl - H3K9 was signiﬁcantly enriched upon expression of PGC - 1 a 4 ( Figure 3F ) . Those included the gene promoter ( 2 . 7 - fold ) and 3 0 untranslated region ( UTR ) ( 3 . 3 - fold ) and a region located 4 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site ( 5 . 9 - fold ) . To identify regions of the myostatin gene that could mediate the repressive effect of PGC1 a 4 , we performed ChIP experiments targeting DNA regions associated with di / trimethyl - H3K9 , a mark for negative gene regulation ( Heard et al . , 2001 ) . Of the identiﬁed regions , a sequence located 5 kb upstream of the myostatin gene showed the highest PGC - 1 a 4 - induced associa - tion with di / trimethyl - H3K9 ( 74 . 3 - fold ) ( Figure 3G ) , suggest - ing the potential location of a regulatory region . Upon expres - sion of PGC - 1 a 4 , the 3 0 UTR of the myostatin gene showed a 3 . 2 - fold higher association with di / tri - methyl - H3K9 , whereas the gene promoter showed a decrease of 80 % . These results identify putative regulatory regions near the IGF1 and myosta - tin genes , which could be the target of PGC - 1 a 4 - mediated regulation . Delivery of PGC - 1 a 4 to Skeletal Muscle Causes Marked Hypertrophy In Vivo To evaluate the effect of PGC - a 4 expression in vivo , we per - formed intramuscular injections of the adenoviral vectors . Mice with severe combined immunodeﬁciency ( SCID ) were used to maximize adenovirus uptake by muscle and to reduce any immune response to the adenoviruses ( Chakkalakal et al . , 2010 ) . Each mouse received an injection of GFP control adeno - virus into the gastrocnemius of one limb ( Figure S4A ) and received an equivalent injection of a PGC - 1 a 4 - expressing adenovirus into the contralateral limb . Fibers expressing PGC - 1 a 4 showed a 59 . 5 % increase in average cross - sectional area ( CSA ) 7 days after injection , compared to controls ( Figures 4A and S4B ) . In particular , PGC1 a 4 drove the appearance of very large ﬁbers ( in the > 1 , 200 m m 2 interval ) that were rarely seen with the control ( Figure 4B ) . PGC - 1 a 4 expression in vivo resulted in a 2 . 3 - fold increase in IGF1 gene expression and in a 50 % reduction in myostatin gene expression ( Figure S4C ) . Further - more , PGC - 1 a 4 expression in muscle resulted in increased S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation levels ( Figure S4D ) , which is indicative of S6K activation ( Pende et al . , 2004 ) . We also performed electroporation of plasmids encoding PGC - 1 a 4 ( or a control ) into the tibialis anterior of C57Bl / 6 mice . As before , each mouse received the control plasmid in one limb and received the PGC - 1 a 4 - expression plasmid in the contralateral limb . Recently , another PGC - 1 a splicing variant has cloned from a mouse BAT complementary DNA ( cDNA ) library and was named NT - PGC - 1 a ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . Although we have been unable to detect expression of endoge - nous NT - PGC - 1 a transcript in skeletal muscle , we tested whether electroporation of a plasmid encoding this PGC - 1 a variant would induce changes in the CSA of targeted ﬁbers , as observed for PGC - 1 a 4 . Although PGC - 1 a 4 and NT - PGC - 1 a mRNAs were expressed at similar levels ( Figure 4C ) , we could not detect NT - PGC - 1 a protein accumulation by immunoblotting ( Figure 4D ) . We observed an average increase of 28 % in CSA of PGC - 1 a 4 - expressing ﬁbers when compared to controls ( Fig - ure S4E ) . Results are also shown as CSA frequency distribution in Figure 4E and show a 34 . 7 % reduction in the smallest CSA interval ( < 1 , 000 m m 2 ) and show increases of 45 . 5 % and 99 . 4 % in the (cid:3) 2 , 000 and (cid:3) 2 , 500 m m 2 intervals ( respectively ) . As before , we observed ﬁbers of CSA in the (cid:3) 3 , 000 and > 3 , 000 m m 2 inter - vals , which were not signiﬁcantly observed in controls ( Fig - ure 4E ) . This increase in average CSA was accompanied by a 10 % increase in muscle weight , compared to control limb ( Fig - ure S4F ) . PGC - 1 a 4 expression resulted in higher phospho - S6K levels ( Figure S4G ) . Expression of NT - PGC - 1 a resulted in a decrease of 46 . 7 % and 66 . 9 % in the number of larger ﬁbers with CSA in the (cid:3) 2 , 000 and (cid:3) 2 , 500 m m 2 intervals ( respectively ) and resulted in an increase of 33 . 8 % in smaller ﬁbers with CSA in the (cid:3) 1 , 500 m m 2 interval ( Figure 4F ) . These results indicate that in vivo delivery of PGC - 1 a 4 results in a marked increase in the CSA of targeted ﬁbers . Regulation of PGC - 1 a 4 Expression during Hindlimb Suspension / Reloading We next investigated whether PGC - 1 a 4 levels are regulated by a hindlimb suspension / reloading protocol , a model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rodents ( Hanson et al . , 2010 ) . As shown in Figure 5A , hindlimb suspension resulted in a small but signif - icant decrease in total PGC - 1 a content in the soleus muscle ( 0 . 85 - fold when compared to control ) , and reloading resulted 1324 Cell 151 , 1319 – 1331 , December 7 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . in a 1 . 6 - fold increase . Changes in muscle wet weights are shown in Figure S5A . No signiﬁcant changes in PGC - 1 a 1 mRNA levels were observed upon suspension , but a marked reduction was seen after reloading ( 50 % versus control ) , when hypertrophic signaling cascades are initiated . Accordingly , during the suspension and reloading phases , we observed a reduction in the expression of transcripts driven by the proxi - mal promoter of the PGC - 1 a gene , as assessed by quantitative real - time PCR using primers directed at that 5 0 UTR region ( Figure S5B ) . Interestingly , PGC - 1 a 4 expression levels drop to 22 % of starting levels after suspension and increase by 18 . 7 - fold with reloading ( Figure 5A ) . The increase in PGC - 1 a 4 mRNA expression during the reloading phase was accom - panied by signiﬁcant protein accumulation ( Figure S5C ) . This expression pattern matches the suspension / atrophy and re - loading / hypertrophy phases and coincided with an increase in IGF1 and a decrease in myostatin gene expression ( 1 . 8 - fold and 40 % , respectively ; Figure 5B ) . Similar results were ob - tained with the gastrocnemius / plantaris muscles ( Figures S5A and S5D ) .

Different Exercise Protocols Result in Differential PGC - 1 a Isoform Expression in Human Muscle We determined the expression of PGC - 1 a 4 in human skeletal muscle with training . Percutaneous muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were ob - tained at baseline and 48 hr after the last training session . Figure 5C shows the change in total PGC - 1 a expression at the end of the indicated exercise protocol ( Table S1 ) . All exercise programs elevated total PGC - 1 a levels in muscle , although to different degrees . Notably , the combined endurance / resistance protocol induced the most signiﬁcant increase in PGC - 1 a expression . We observed no changes in PGC - 1 a 4 expression in the endurance protocol group ( Figure 5D ) . However , both the resistance and the combined exercise programs led to a 1 . 5 - and 3 - fold increase in the expression of PGC - 1 a 4 ( respectively ) . We observed a reduction in myostatin gene expression only in the resistance and combined groups ( Figure 5E ) but observed no statistically signiﬁcant changes in IGF1 expression ( Figure 5F ) . Interestingly , a very signiﬁcant correlation across all groups ( R = 0 . 64 ) was observed between the changes in PGC - 1 a 4 expression and performance in the leg press exercise ( Figure 5G ) . Transgenic Muscle - Speciﬁc Expression of PGC - 1 a 4 Drives Increased Muscle Mass , Strength , and Reduced Adiposity To evaluate the effects of chronically elevated PGC - 1 a 4 levels in muscle , we generated the transgenic mouse model Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 . This mouse ( Figure 5H ) expresses PGC - 1 a 4 under the control of a MEF2C enhancer / myogenin promoter ( Li et al . , Cell 151 , 1319 – 1331 , December 7 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1325 2005 ) . Transgenic muscle expresses PGC - 1 a 4 mRNA 30 - fold above endogenous levels ( Figure 5I ) and shows signiﬁcant PGC - 1 a 4 protein accumulation ( Figure 5H ) . Importantly , these levels of expression bring PGC - 1 a 4 levels up to those observed during the reloading phase of the suspension / reloading experi - ments ( i . e . , 19 - fold , Figure 5A ) . Analysis of the Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mouse shows redder muscle when compared to the wild - type littermate controls ( Figure 5H ) . The pattern of gene expression observed in the muscle of Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice ( Figure S5E ) was similar to the one observed upon expression of PGC - 1 a 4 in myotubes ( Figures 2D – 2F ) with the exception of IGF1 . In these animals , and consistent with our previous results , we observed a 64 . 4 % reduction in myostatin expression . However , there was no increase in IGF1 expression ( Figure S5E ) . PGC - 1 a 4 transgenic mice showed an increase in muscle wet weight as observed in Figure 6A . The increase in muscle mass was accom - panied by an average increase of 12 % in ﬁber CSA ( Figure 6B ) , with a signiﬁcant increase in larger ﬁbers ( Figures S6A and To t a l P G C - 1 α 1 P G C - 1 α 4 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 10 15 20 25 Control Suspension Reloading R e l a t i ve m RNA E x p r ess i on R e l a t i ve m RNA E x p r ess i on R e l a t i ve m RNA E x p r ess i on I G F 1 M S T N 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 Control Suspension Reloading S e d e n t a r y E ndu r a n c e R es i s t a n c e C o m b i n e d 0 1 2 3 4 hPGC - 1 α 4 S e d e n t a r y E ndu r a n ce R es i s t a n ce C o m b i n e d 0 1 2 3 4 hMSTN S e d e n t a r y E ndu r a n ce R es i s t a n ce C o m b i n e d 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 A B C D E * , # * * * , # * * * * * , # * * Leg Press S e d e n t a r y E ndu r a n ce R es i s t a n ce C o m b i n e d - 40 - 20 0 20 40 60 % C h a ng e o ve r 8 w eeks F G hIGF1 S e d e n t a r y E ndu r a n ce R es i s t a n ce C o m b i n e d 0 1 2 3 4 5 R e l a t i ve m RNA E x p r ess i on R e l a t i ve m RNA E x p r ess i on R e l a t i ve m RNA E x p r ess i on Total hPGC - 1 α * * H I 01234520 25 30 35 R e l a t i ve m RNA E x p r ess i on Total PGC - 1 α 4 Wild - type Myo - PGC - 1 α 4 * * Wild - type Myo - PGC - 1 α 4 α - P G C - 1 α 37 kDa * * , # * , # * , # Figure 5 .

Analysis of myosin heavy chain expression in transgenic muscle revealed a higher representation of type IIa and IIx ﬁbers at the expense of IIb ( Figures 6C and S6C ) . Interestingly , these animals also show reduced adiposity . Skeletal - muscle - speciﬁc PGC - 1 a 4 transgenics show a reduction of 20 . 7 % and 40 % in the mass of the epididymal and retroperitoneal fat depots ( Fig - ure 6D ) . Among the tissues analyzed , this observation proved to be selective to fat ( Figure S6D ) . When compared to the wild - type controls , the PGC1 a 4 transgenics show a 20 % increase in maximum force generated ( Figure 6E ) . Interestingly , transgenic muscle also proved to be more fatigue - resistant than wild - type ( Figure 6F ) . These results show that elevation of PGC - 1 a 4 levels in skeletal muscle results in a hypertrophy phenotype accompa - nied by a signiﬁcant increase in strength . Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 Mice Show Less Muscle Loss upon Hindlimb Suspension and Improved Exercise Performance To evaluate the physiological alterations in the Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mouse , we performed hindlimb suspension / reloading experi - ments . Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice lost signiﬁcantly less muscle mass 1326 Cell 151 , 1319 – 1331 , December 7 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . during the suspension phase ( Figure 6G ) and trended toward accumulating more muscle mass during the reloading process . Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice were evaluated for their performance on an exercise tolerance test and were compared to littermate controls and to the previously reported mice with muscle - speciﬁc PGC - 1 a 1 expression ( MCK - PGC - 1 a ) . As expected ( Lin et al . , 2002 ) , MCK - PGC - 1 a mice remained on the tread - mill 60 % longer than controls ( Figure 6H ) . The Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice showed improved performance , with a 28 % increase in time to exhaustion compared to controls ( Figure 6H ) . No differ - ences in glucose tolerance were observed between these mouse models and controls ( Figure S6E ) . Metabolic proﬁling of the Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice by using Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System ( CLAMS ) revealed that , although these animals have higher maximum oxygen consumption ( VO 2 ) and carbon dioxide elimination ( VCO 2 ) , their respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) is unchanged ( Figure S6F ) .

These results show that the increase in muscle mass and strength observed in the Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice does not result in an overt metabolic phenotype but contributes to better exer - cise performance and protects against hindlimb unloading - induced atrophy . Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 Mice Show Resistance to Cancer - Induced Cachexia with Improved Glucose Tolerance and Preserved Muscle Mass Cancer cachexia is a very important complication of many malig - nancies , resulting in severe muscle wasting and negatively affecting patient outcome ( Fearon et al . , 2012 ) . Wild - type and Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice were inoculated with the Lewis lung carci - noma ( LLC ) cells , and the cachectic phenotype was evaluated 24 – 28 days after inoculation . Importantly , this model of cachexia is characterized by loss of muscle mass and strength and by development of glucose intolerance ( Busquets et al . , 2012 ; Das et al . , 2011 ) . Upon necropsy analysis of tumor - bearing animals , muscles of Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice looked less pale and healthier when compared to cachectic muscle from wild - type Cell 151 , 1319 – 1331 , December 7 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1327 mice ( Figure 7A ) . Strikingly , tumor - bearing Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice lost only 10 % of gastrocnemius muscle mass ( Figure 7B ) , compared to wild - type tumor - bearing animals ( 29 % ) . This was accompanied by improvements in both muscle force produc - tion and myoﬁber cross - sectional area ( Figures 7C and S7A ) . Cancer - induced cachexia has been shown to occur concomi - tantly with dysregulation of myostatin and IGF1 expression in muscle ( Busquets et al . , 2012 ; Fearon et al . , 2012 ; White et al . , 2011 ) . Analysis of muscle gene expression in the different groups revealed that cachectic wild - type animals indeed have a 2 . 2 - fold increase in myostatin gene expression , but only a 1 . 2 - fold in - crease was seen in tumor - bearing Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 animals ( Fig - ure 7D ) . Conversely , IGF1 gene expression was 59 % lower in cachectic wild - type muscle , whereas the corresponding Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice showed only a 27 % reduction ( Figure 7D ) . SMAD phosphorylation , a marker of myostatin signal transduc - tion , was clearly suppressed in the Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice ( Fig - ure S7B ) . The expression of other muscle wasting markers such as MuRF1 and atrogin1 / MAFbx1 ( Figure S7C ) was also strongly reduced in cachectic Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice ( 2 . 3 - and 1 . 9 - fold , respectively ) when compared to wild - type tumor - bearing controls ( 5 . 6 - and 7 . 1 - fold , respectively ) . Tumors in both genotypes of mice grew at the same rates ( Figure S7D ) .

See also Figure S7 . the development of the cachexia pheno - type for physical activity , glucose toler - ance , and food consumption . No changes in food intake were observed between wild - type and Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice with or without LLC cell inoculation ( Figure S7E ) . Although physical activity was similar between wild - type and Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice before the inoculation of the cancer cells ( Figure 7E ) , it declined more strongly with tumor load in wild - type than in Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice ( Figure 7E ) . Tumor - bearing Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice displayed improved glucose tolerance compared to cachectic wild - type mice , as shown by their ability to clear a bolus of glucose ( Figures 7F and 7G ) . Thus , transgenic expression of PGC - 1 a 4 in muscle dramatically ameliorates cancer - induced cachexia through re - duced loss of muscle mass and strength and improved glucose homeostasis during cancer progression . DISCUSSION Exercise is usually considered in two broad categories : endur - ance training , which involves low - resistance work of longer dura - tion , and resistance training , which requires more powerful movements of shorter duration . Health studies suggest that most humans should participate in both types of exercise , espe - cially in aging populations ( Nair , 2005 ) . Molecular mechanisms underlying the different exercise modalities are not well under - stood , but the importance of maintaining muscle mass and strength as humans age has motivated considerable research into the pathways of muscle growth ; these have highlighted the importance of the IGF1 and myostatin systems ( Schiafﬁno 1328 Cell 151 , 1319 – 1331 , December 7 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . and Mammucari , 2011 ; Lee , 2004 ; McPherron et al . , 1997 ) . PGC - 1 a , now termed PGC - 1 a 1 , is induced by exercise and regulates many of the effects of endurance training : mitochondrial bio - genesis , ﬁber - type switching , angiogenesis , and resistance to muscle atrophy . However , gain - of - function studies with PGC - 1 a have not shown any increase in either muscle mass or strength ( Lin et al . , 2002 ; Sandri et al . , 2006 ; Wende et al . , 2007 ) . Similarly , other PGC - 1 a variants have been shown to spe - ciﬁcally affect energy metabolism in BAT and skeletal muscle , but no effects on cell size have been reported ( Tadaishi et al . , 2011 ; Yoshioka et al . , 2009 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . Here , we show that the Pgc - 1 a gene encodes a protein ( PGC - 1 a 4 ) that is expressed robustly in muscle and is particularly induced by resistance training . The Pgc - 1 a gene has been shown to be subject to alternative splicing , but the PGC - 1 a 4 iso - form is undescribed . It is somewhat similar to the NT - PGC - 1 a isoform ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) , but PGC - 1 a 4 comes from a different gene promoter and has a completely distinct N terminus derived from the upstream exon 1 . Our data strongly suggest that the distinct N - terminal sequence of the PGC - 1 a 4 is important in allowing this protein to accumulate in skeletal muscle and perhaps in other tissues . PGC - 1 a 4 speciﬁcally activates the expression of IGF1 and suppresses myostatin in skeletal muscle . That the net result of PGC - 1 a 4 expression in cultured myotubes represents bona ﬁde hypertrophy , as opposed to hyperplasia , can be deduced from the fact that protein content per unit DNA doubles . In a classical cellular system of muscle cell hypertrophy , stimula - tion with clenbuterol , PGC1 a 4 is required for this increase in myotube size . PGC - 1 a 4 also induces muscle ﬁber hypertrophy in vivo in three independent expression systems used here : transduction with adenoviral vectors , delivery of naked DNA , and transgenic expression with a muscle - selective promoter . All of these systems give very comparable results , with muscle ﬁber hypertrophy , modulation of myostatin expression , and in some cases , increases in IGF1 expression . Importantly , we see no changes in mitochondrial gene expression , which is a virtual hallmark of PGC - 1 a 1 expression in skeletal muscle . This could be partly explained by the fact that PGC - 1 a 4 does not robustly coactivate ERRs . Transgenic mice with an increase in PGC - 1 a 4 expression within or close to the physiological range results in a 60 % decrease in myostatin mRNA expression . This is comparable to the50 % decreaseobservedinmiceheterozygousforanullmuta - tion in the myostatin gene . Muscle mass changes in myostatin heterozygous mice range from 7 % to 35 % , depending on the muscle type and study ( Gentry et al . , 2011 ; Lee , 2007 ; Mendias et al . , 2006 ) . The changes observed in the Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mouse are comparable to those reported in two of those studies ( Gentry et al . , 2011 ; Mendias et al . , 2006 ) . Although effects on other molecular systems are entirely plausible , the effect of PGC - 1 a 4 on myostatin gene expression is likely to be a major contributor to the phenotype seen in the Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 animals . Importantly , PGC - 1 a 4 transgenic mice have an increase in muscle force production proportional to the increase in muscle mass , indicating that forced PGC - 1 a 4 expression in muscle results in functional hypertrophy . The increase in muscle mass and strength results in other signiﬁcant functional conse - quences , including exercise tolerance and resistance to hin - dlimb suspension - induced muscle atrophy . The transgenic ex - pression of PGC - 1 a 4 also had a strikingly protective effect in the pathogenesis of cancer - induced cachexia . Although tumors grew at an equal rate in mice of both genotypes , tumor - bearing Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice lose less muscle mass and strength than controls and do not develop the glucose intolerance observed in the cachectic control animals . This protective effect is clearly reﬂected in the spontaneous physical activity of the tumor - bearing transgenic animals , which approaches that of non - tumor - bearing wild - type controls , even in the most severe phases of tumor development . Because PGC - 1 a 4 contains the complete activation domain also present in PGC - 1 a 1 , it seems highly likely that PGC - 1 a 4 also functions as a coactivator . However , because PGC - 1 a 1 does not stimulate IGF1 and myostatin gene expression , PGC - 1 a 4 may be interacting with a very different set of DNA - binding proteins . Interestingly , histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibition can induce muscle hypertrophy ( Iezzi et al . , 2004 ) through a mechanism that involves induction of follistatin expression and increased myoblast recruitment and fusion . Follistatin is a negative regulator of myostatin action and therefore acts posi - tively on muscle mass independent of the IGF1 pathway ( Iezzi et al . , 2004 ) . We have observed a reduction in follistatin mRNA levels upon PGC - 1 a 4 expression ( Figure 2F ) , which would sug - gest that it does not contribute to PGC - 1 a 4 - induced muscle hypertrophy . In agreement with this result , PGC - 1 a 4 can pro - mote myotube hypertrophy without an increase in myoblast fusion ( Figure S3A ) . Finally , the potential of PGC - 1 a 4 in therapeutics seems obvious . Loss of muscle mass and strength in aging , wasting diseases and in certain muscular dystrophies affects both quality of life and longevity . While protein therapeutics for both the IGF1 and the myostatin pathways are being developed , PGC - 1 a 4 can , in principle , modulate both of these systems in a highly coordi - nated way . Because PGC - 1 a 4 comes from a distinct promoter with some degree of distinct regulation in vivo , it will be important to ﬁnd chemical matter that can modulate PGC - 1 a 4 gene expression . In addition , PGC - 1 a 4 gene expression might be used as a helpful readout for optimizing resistance training that focuses on increasing muscle strength . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES PGC - 1 a Isoform Cloning and Detection PGC - 1 a isoforms were cloned from a mouse soleus cDNA library . Primer sequences used for cloning and for quantitative real - time PCR detection of the different isoforms in mouse and human tissues can be found in Extended Experimental Procedures .

To detect all PGC - 1 a variants by immunoblotting , anti - PGC - 1 a antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem ( ST1202 ) . For PGC - 1 a isoform immunoprecipitation experiments , antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies ( sc - 13067 ) .

Human Exercise Training Table S1 provides a complete description of the exercise programs , and a detailed protocol can be found in Extended Experimental Procedures . Generation of Transgenic Mice and Animal Experimentation Generation of Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice was done by cloning the PGC - 1 a 4 cDNA in frontofaMEF2Cenhancer / MyogeninpromoterDNAsequences ( Lietal . , 2005 ) , followed by the human growth hormone polyA . Mice were maintained under standard conditions . All experiments and protocols were performed in accor - dancewiththeDana - FarberCancerInstituteorBethIsraelDeaconessMedical CenterAnimalFacilityInstitutionalAnimalCareandUseCommitteeregulations . Muscle Force Measurements Maximal muscle force was measured as previously described ( Axell et al . , 2006 ) with an isometric transducer ( ADInstruments , Colorado Springs , CO ) . Speciﬁcmaximalforcewasquantiﬁedbycorrectingformusclemass . Afatigue test was performed following the maximal contractions . Exercise Tolerance Test Exercisetolerancewasperformedaspreviouslydescribed ( Aranyetal . , 2007 ) . Cachexia Studies Wild - type and Myo - PGC - 1 a 4 mice were given a subcutaneous injection in the left ﬂank of either 10 7 LLC cells in PBS or PBS alone ( control ) . Stages of tumor severity were deﬁned as follows : Pre ( before development of tumor ) , 1 – 5 days after inoculation ; Moderate ( moderate tumor size ) , 10 – 15 days after inocula - tion ; and Severe ( large tumor size ) , (cid:2) 23 – 28 days after inoculation . Mice with tumor development were sacriﬁced 28 days after injection . Statistical Analysis All results are expressed as means ± SD for cell experiments and ± SEM for animal experiments . Two - tailed Student’s t test was used to determine p values . Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as p < 0 . 05 .
