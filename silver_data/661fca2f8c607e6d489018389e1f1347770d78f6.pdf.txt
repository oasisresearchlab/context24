Methods : C2C12 were randomly divided into ﬁ ve groups : un - stretched control , six or 8 h of ﬁ fteen percent stretch , and six or 8 h of twenty percent stretch . Cyclic mechanical stretch of C2C12 were completed using a computer - controlled FlexCell Strain Unit . Cell proliferation and IGF - 1 concentration in medium were detected by CCK8 and ELISA , respectively .

Appropriate mechanical stress promotes maintenance and hypertrophy of skeletal muscle , while overstress induces damage of muscles . Growth , maintenance and hypertrophy of skeletal muscles as well as repair of injured muscles are associated with an ordered multi - step process in which muscle satellite cells activate and proliferate , myogenic differentiate and fuse into multinucleated myotubes ( Kook et al . , 2008a ) . Hence , studies have established the signi ﬁ cant role of mechanical stress on the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells as well as the development of skeletal muscles . Cyclic mechanical stretch of 10 % magnitude at 0 . 5 Hz frequency signi ﬁ cantly promoted the proliferation and inhibited the differ - entiation of adult bovine satellite cells ( Kook et al . , 2008b ) . Mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 was considered as activated satellite cells and widely used as a model to study the mechanisms controlling myogenesis , including the ﬁ rst step of myogenesis : proliferation and differentiation . Cyclic mechanical stretch with an optimal magnitude ( 10 % ) and frequency ( 0 . 5 Hz ) for 1 h could enhance the proliferation of C2C12 cells and inhibited their differentiation into myotubes ( Kook et al . , 2008a , b ) . When the magnitude and fre - quency increased to 17 % and 1 Hz , cyclic mechanical stretch remain increased the proliferation of C2C12 cells ( Kumar et al . , 2004 ) . Except for the proliferation and differentiation , appropriate me - chanical stretch can activate muscle and myotube protein synthe - sis . Cyclic stretch of 5 % or 15 % for 30 min at 1 Hz frequency ( Nakai * Corresponding author . Department of Kinesiology , Shanghai University of Sport , Shanghai 200438 , China .

Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 450 ( 2017 ) 83 e 93 et al . , 2010 ) and 15 % cyclic stretch for 4 h ( 1 Hz ) both induced the protein synthesis of C2C12 cells ( Nakai et al . , 2015 ) . Chronical mechanical stretch promoted differentiated C2C12 cells to form multinucleated myotubes and increased protein synthesis ( Gao and Carson , 2016 ) . However , until now there is no report about cyclic mechanical stretch inhibited proliferation of C2C12 or induced damage to C2C12 . Cyclic mechanical stretch of 20 % magnitude lasted from 0 to 4 h caused the apoptosis of rat aortic smooth muscle cells in time - dependent manner ( Ito et al . , 2015 ) . So in the present study , cyclic mechanical stretches of 15 % or 20 % elongation at 0 . 5 Hz frequency ( 1 s of stretch , 1 s of relaxation ) were chosen to explore the mechanisms of cyclic mechanical stretch on the pro - liferation of C2C12 myoblasts . Androgen plays crucial roles in increasing skeletal muscle mass , strength and muscle synthesis , and androgen withdrawal causes muscle atrophy . The anabolic action of testosterone , the main androgen in skeletal muscle , is associated with an increase in the number of satellite cells and muscle ﬁ ber hypertrophy , which was mediated by intracellular androgen receptor ( AR ) . AR in skeletal muscles was expressed predominantly in satellite cells and myo - nuclei , and satellite cells are therefore considered to be a direct androgen target in skeletal muscle . Testosterone has been shown to stimulate satellite cell proliferation not only in skeletal muscles but also in in vitro primary myoblasts and myoblast cell line C2C12 ( Dubois et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , exogenous androgen increased the protein synthesis of bovine satellite cells in a dose - dependent manner through the mediation of AR . Suf ﬁ cient studies support that the role of androgen / AR in regulating muscle protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy is closely associated with Insulin - like growth factor gene ( IGF - 1 ) / IGF - 1 receptor ( IGF - 1R ) by cross - talk . On one hand , IGF - 1 / IGF - 1R is a target gene of AR with androgen response elements in IGF - 1 pro - moter , and the pro - proliferation effects of androgen / AR was miti - gated in skeletal muscle ﬁ bers of MKR mice which expressed a dominant negative form of IGF - IR and in muscle cells whose IGF - 1R expression was blocked using IGF - 1R siRNA ( Serra et al . , 2011 ) . On the other hand , IGF - 1 resulted in a dose - and time - dependent in - crease of total AR and activation of AR in differentiating C2C12 ( Kim and Lee , 2009a , b ) . IGF - 1 plays a key role in the proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells . Exogenous IGF - 1 not only signi ﬁ cantly induces the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts in a dose - dependent manner , but also increased the number of satellite cells in the skeletal muscle of chicken embryos ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , exogenous IGF - 1 prevented the decrease of protein synthesis and inhibited the in - creases of breakdown of myo ﬁ brillar proteins and apoptosis induced by simvastatin in C2C12 myotubes ( Bonifacio et al . , 2017 ) . IGF - 1 induces autophosphorylation by binding to its receptor , IGF - 1R , thus activates the most prominently downstream pathway , phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt . Akt is a serine - threonine protein kinase that can induce muscles protein synthesis via the downstream effector , mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) and inhibit muscles apoptosis through the mediation of FOXO ( also called “ forkhead ” ) ( Glass , 2010 ) . MLC / mIGF - 1 mice ( overexpression of IGF - 1 in Type Ⅱ muscle ﬁ bres ) had higher weights and muscle mass of extensor digitorum longus , which is associated with the activation of PI3K / Akt / mTOR pathway ( Christoffolete et al . , 2015 ) . So IGF - 1 ' s pro - hypertrophy activity comes predominantly through its ability to activate the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) . Exercise - induced hypertrophy of skeletal muscles was close related to local IGF - 1 rather than serum IGF - 1 both in human ( Frystyk , 2010 , Suetta et al . , 2010 ) and in mouse ( Matheny et al . , 2009 ) . Except for exercise , mechanical stretch also increases the secretion of IGF - 1 and activates IGF - 1 / PI3K pathway in several cells ( Honsho et al . , 2009 , L . Song et al . , 2012 ) . For example , cyclic me - chanical stretch promoted the proliferation of cultured cardiac ﬁ - broblasts via activated IGF - 1 / Akt pathway ( Honsho et al . , 2009 ) and of vascular smooth muscle cells through the activation of IGF - 1R / Akt pathway ( L . Song et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , mechanical stretch promoted Akt phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells ( X . Liu et al . , 2015 , Seo et al . , 2013 ) to induce vascular remodeling . However , the only report of an effect of mechanical stretch on IGF - 1 / PI3K pathway in skeletal muscle cells was that of 15 % cyclic mechanical stretch for 4 h at 1 Hz frequency activated mTOR of C2C12 cells to increase protein synthesis ( Nakai et al . , 2015 ) . Three subsets of Mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) , p38 MAPK ( p38 ) and c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , are vital pathways that transfers extracellular signal into cells and closely associates with the proliferation and differentiation of cells . Growing evidences point to the important role of MAPKs on mechanical stretch - regulated proliferation , differentiation and protein synthesis of skeletal muscle cells . For example , 10 % of cyclic mechanical stretch stimulated the proliferation and inhibit the differentiation of bovine satellite cells ( Kook et al . , 2008a , b ) and C2C12 myoblasts ( Kook et al . , 2008a , b ) via activation of ERK1 / 2 and prolonged acti - vation of p38 ( but not ERK1 / 2 ) , respectively ; cyclic stretch pro - moted the protein synthesis of C2C12 by increasing the activities of p38 , ERK1 / 2 and JNK responsive to 30 min of 5 % or 15 % stretch ( 1 Hz ) ( Nakai et al . , 2010 ) and by activating ERK1 / 2 and p38 responsive to chronical stretch ( Gao and Carson , 2016 ) . In recent years , studies have shown that there is a close relationship between MAPK pathway and AR . In prostate cancer cells , overexpression of HepaCAM suppressed nucleus translocation of AR with the decrease in the activity of ERK pathway ( Song et al . , 2014 ) . Androgen - induced spines formation in hippocampal neurons could be inhibited by p38 and ERK1 / 2 pathway inhibitor ( Song et al . , 2014 ) . Although there are many studies about the effects of mechanical stretch on proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells , the changes of AR protein levels response to mechanical stretch , the role of AR on proliferation of muscle cells and the interactions of AR with IGF - 1 , Akt and MAPK ( p38 , ERK1 / 2 ) in stretched skeletal muscle cells have not been previously examined . Therefore , the main purpose of our study was to detect the effects of 15 % and 20 % of cyclic mechanical stretch on AR expression , its role on the pro - liferation of C2C12 myoblasts and related signal pathways . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cell culture Murine myogenic C2C12 were obtained from Heyuan Biotech - nology Limited Company ( Shanghai , China ) . Cells were cultured in Dulbecco ' s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM ) ( Gibco , USA ) sup - plemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Corning , USA ) and antibiotics ( 100 U / ml of penicillin G and 100 m g / ml streptomycin ) ( Gibco , USA ) ( growth medium ) ( Kook et al . , 2008a , b ; Nakai et al . , 2015 ; 2010 ) in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air at 95 % humidity and 37 (cid:1) C . The cells used in all the experiments were from passage 3 to passage 8 . 2 . 2 . Cyclic mechanical stretch Cyclic mechanical stretch was performed in vitro using a BioFlex strain unit ( BioFlex , Flexcell International Corporation , Hills - borough , NC , USA ) . C2C12 cells were adjusted to 1 (cid:3) 10 5 / ml density and seeded onto a six - well plate with ﬂ exible collagen - coated sil - icone rubber membranes at the bottom of each well ( BioFlex , Y . Ma et al . / Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 450 ( 2017 ) 83 e 93 84 Flexcell International Corporation , Hillsborough , NC , USA ) . After 24 h the cells were subjected to cyclic strain of 15 % or 20 % elon - gation at a frequency of 30 cycles / min ( 1 s of stretch , 1 s of relax - ation ) for 6 h or 8 h using a computer - controlled vacuum stretch apparatus ( FX - 4000T Tension Plus System , FlexCell International Corporation , Hillsborough , NC , USA ) . A negative pressure was formed by a vacuum pump in a ﬂ exible - bottom six well plate and caused deformation of the bottom , therefore the cells adhered to the bottom of plates were subjected to mechanical stretch . The elongation of stretch was dependent on the negative pressure controlled by computer controlled pump , which could be set up in computer before experiment . Control C2C12 cells were growth in parallel with identical experimental conditions ( growth medium ) without any mechanical stretching . 2 . 3 . Detection of cell proliferation When stretch ﬁ nished , culture medium was replaced immedi - ately by fresh medium and cultured for 24 h , then cell counting kit - 8 ( Dojindo laboratories , Japan ) was added into the medium in proportion . After 2 . 5 h incubation , OD value of the medium was detected at 450 nm . 2 . 4 . Determination of IGF - 1 concentration in culture medium After ﬁ nishing stretch , culture medium was replaced by DMEM without fetal bovine serum immediately and incubated for 24 h , then the medium was collected and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 min at 4 (cid:1) C . The IGF - 1 concentration of the supernatant was determined by ELISA Kit ( Mouse / Rat IGF - 1 Quantikine ELISA Kit , MG100 , R & D Systems Inc , MN , USA ) according to the manufac - turer ' s instructions . 2 . 5 . Treatments of C2C12 cells with AR inhibitor , IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody , recombinant IGF - 1 , and speci ﬁ c inhibitors of p38 , ERK1 / 2 andr PI3K For the successful inhibition of AR activity in un - stretched C2C12 cells using 20 and 40 m M Flutamide ( Hughes et al . , 2016 ) , three dosages ( 20 , 40 , and 60 m M ) of AR inhibitor Flutamide ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , CA , USA ) were added into culture medium and incubated for 1 h , then the cells were stretched by 6 h of 15 % elongation . According to the manufacturers ' instructions , different dosages ( 25 , 50 , and 100 ng / ml ) of IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody and recombinant IGF - 1 ( 200 , 500 and 1000 ng / mL ) ( both R & D Systems , MN , USA ) were used to decrease and increase the level of IGF - 1 in C2C12 cells respectively , then the cells with decreased IGF - 1 completed 15 % stretch and the cells with increased IGF - 1 under - took 20 % stretch . Similarly , before 15 % and 20 % of mechanical stretch 10 m M of speci ﬁ c inhibitor of p38 ( SB203580 ) , ERK1 / 2 ( U0126 ) and PI3K ( LY294002 ) ( all Cell Signaling , MA , USA ) were used for 2 h to inhibit the expressions and / or activities of p38 , ERK1 / 2 or PI3K in C2C12 cells , respectively . The culture medium of C2C12 cells supplemented with the above reagents had kept un - changed until stretch was ﬁ nished , and the medium was replaced and cultured for 24 h before CCk - 8 and Western blot analysis . 2 . 6 . Western blot Cells were scraped and lysed using ice - cold lysis buffer ( Beyo - time Biotechnology , China ) at 24 h after stretch . The cell extracts were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 20 min at 4 (cid:1) C , then protein concentrations were detected by enhanced BCA protein assay kit ( Beyotime Biotechnology , China ) . Extracts ( 80 m g ) were fraction - ated on 10 % SDS e PAGE gels . The resolved proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes , blocked with 5 % ( w / v ) nonfat milk , and then incubated overnight at 4 (cid:1) C with pri - mary antibodies against AR ( sc - 816 , 1 : 500 ) , IGF - 1R ( sc - 7952 , 1 : 500 ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , CA , USA ) , p38 ( 8690P , 1 : 1000 ) , p - p38 ( 4511P , 1 : 1000 ) , ERK1 / 2 ( 4695P , 1 : 1000 ) , p - ERK1 / 2 ( 4370P , 1 : 2000 ) , PI3K ( 4257P , 1 : 1000 ) , p - PI3K ( 4228P , 1 : 1000 ) , Akt ( 4691P , 1 : 1000 ) , p - Akt ( 4060P , 1 : 2000 ) or b - actin ( 8H10D10 , 1 : 1000 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology , MA , USA ) . The blots were washed three times , for 5 min each time , with TBST ( Tris - buffered saline with Tween 20 ) and incubated with HRP conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature . The blots were washed again as described above and developed with advance reagent ( Tanon Biotechnology , China ) to visualize the protein bands by automatic chemiluminescence apparatus ( Tanon Biotechnology , China ) . The density of bands was determined using Bio - image software ( Tanon Science & Technology Co . , Ltd . , Shanghai , China ) and normalized against b - actin . 2 . 7 . Statistical analyses All the experiments were repeated at least three times . The data are expressed as means ± standard deviation ( SD ) and the level of statistical signi ﬁ cance was set as p < 0 . 05 . Statistical analysis was performed using one - way ANOVA and post hoc comparisons using LSD tests by SPSS 21 . 0 for windows . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Cyclic mechanical stretch - regulated proliferation of C2C12 cells Compared with un - stretched control , the proliferation of C2C12 cells was signi ﬁ cantly increased by 15 % stretch for 6 h rather than 8 h , while the cell proliferation was decreased by 6 h and 8 h of 20 % stretch , with more obvious in 8 h of stretch ( Fig . 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Role of AR on the proliferation of C2C12 cells induced by cyclic mechanical stretch As shown in Fig . 2A , compared with un - stretched control , 6 h of 15 % stretch resulted in a signi ﬁ cant increase of AR protein level in C2C12 cells , but the promoted effect of 15 % stretch on AR protein level was almost disappeared at 8 h stretch . Signi ﬁ cant decreases of AR protein levels were found in 6 h and 8 h of 20 % stretched C2C12 cells . For clarifying the role of AR on the proliferation of Fig . 1 . Cyclic mechanical stretch - regulated proliferation of C2C12 cells . C2C12 cells were seeded onto a six well plate with type I collagen - coated ﬂ exible - bottom at 1 (cid:3) 10 5 / ml density and inoculated for 24 h , then the cells were undertaken cyclic mechanical stretch ( 15 % or 20 % magnitude at 0 . 5 Hz frequency for 6 h or 8 h ) by a computer - controlled vacuum stretch apparatus . Twenty four hours after stretch , the proliferation of C2C12 cells was detected byCCK - 8 . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 vsun - stretched control ; # # p < 0 . 01 vs 6 h of relative stretch . Y . Ma et al . / Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 450 ( 2017 ) 83 e 93 85 C2C12 cells induced by 6 h of 15 % stretch , the cells were treated with different dosages ( 20 , 40 , and 60 m M ) of AR inhibitor Fluta - mide to inhibit AR activity . The increased proliferation of C2C12 cells induced by 6 h of 15 % stretch was attenuated by Flutamide at a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 2B ) , indicating the important role of AR on the proliferation of C2C12 cells induced by 6 h of 15 % cyclic mechanical stretch . 3 . 3 . Cyclic mechanical stretch - regulated IGF - 1 secretion and IGF - 1R protein expression in C2C12 cells IGF - 1 concentrations in culture medium was signi ﬁ cant enhanced by 6 h but not 8 h of 15 % stretch while signi ﬁ cant reduced only by 8 h of 20 % stretch compared with un - stretched control ( Fig . 3A ) . For IGF - 1R , signi ﬁ cant increase was induced by 6 h rather than 8 h of 15 % stretch while 20 % stretch for 6 h and 8 h , especial 8 h decreased the protein expression of IGF - 1R signi ﬁ cantly ( Fig . 3B ) . 3 . 4 . Effects of IGF - 1 on AR expression regulated by cyclic mechanical stretch in C2C12 cells For quantifying the role of IGF - 1 on AR expression modulated by cyclic mechanical stretch in C2C12 cells , IGF - 1 neutralizing anti - body ( dosage : 25 , 50 or 100 ng / ml ) and recombinant IGF - 1 ( 200 , 500 or 1000 ng / ml ) were used to inhibit and promote the level of IGF - 1 before 15 % and 20 % stretch , respectively . The increase of AR protein level resulted from 6 h of 15 % stretch was decreased by IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody at doses of 50 and 100 ng / ml ( Fig . 4A ) . Recombinant IGF - 1 signi ﬁ cantly up - regulated the protein level of AR in 6 h of 20 % stretch at a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 4B ) . These results indicated that the modulation of AR by cyclic me - chanical stretch was mediated by IGF - 1 . 3 . 5 . Cyclic mechanical stretch - modulated PI3K expression and activity in C2C12 cells Both 15 % and 20 % stretches did not play a role on the expression of PI3K ( ratio of PI3K / b - actin ) in C2C12 cells . However , PI3K activity re ﬂ ected by the ratio of phosphorylated . PI3K ( p - PI3K ) with PI3K in Fig . 2 . Role of AR on the proliferation of C2C12 cells induced by cyclic mechanical stretch . A : Cyclic mechanical stretch - induced variations of AR expression in C2C12 cells ; B : Changed proliferation of C2C12 cells resulted from AR inhibitor , Flutamide . C2C12 cells were stretch by 15 % or 20 % elongation at 0 . 5 Hz frequency for 6 h or 8 h , then AR protein levels in the cells were determined by Western blot and one of the representative results was shown ( upper of Fig . 2A ) . b - actin was used for loading control .

The culture medium of C2C12 cells was not changed until ﬁ nishing stretch and 24 h after stretch the proliferation of the cells was detected by CCK - 8 ( Fig . 2B ) . * p < 0 . 05 vs un - stretched control , # p < 0 . 05 vs 15 % stretch ; D p < 0 . 05 vs 20 m M 15 % stretch þ Flutamine .

Ma et al . / Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 450 ( 2017 ) 83 e 93 86 protein level was signi ﬁ cant increased in 15 % stretched C2C12 cells for 6 h rather than 8 h , and signi ﬁ cant decreased by 6 h and 8 h of 20 % stretches ( Fig . 5 ) . 3 . 6 . Effects of IGF - 1 on the expression and activity of PI3K regulated by cyclic mechanical stretch in C2C12 cells For quantifying the role of IGF - 1 on the expression and activity of PI3K resulted from cyclic mechanical stretch in C2C12 cells , IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody ( dosage : 25 , 50 or 100 ng / ml ) and recombi - nant IGF - 1 ( 200 , 500 or 1000 ng / ml ) were used to inhibit and promote the level of IGF - 1 before 15 % and 20 % stretch , respectively . The increase of PI3K activity ( p - PI3K / PI3K ratio ) resulted from 6 h of 15 % stretch was decreased by IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody at doses of 50 and 100 ng / ml ( Fig . 6A ) . Recombinant IGF - 1 of 500 and 1000 ng / ml doses signi ﬁ cantly up - regulated the activity of PI3K in 6 h of 20 % stretch at a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 6B ) . In addition , IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody and recombinant IGF - 1 did not alter the expression of PI3K in stretched C2C12 cells . These results indicated that the modulation of PI3K activity by cyclic mechanical stretch was mediated by IGF - 1 . 3 . 7 . Effects of PI3K / Akt speci ﬁ c inhibitor on the expression of AR in 15 % or 20 % stretched C2C12 cells For clarifying whether the IGF - 1 regulated AR expression was mediated by PI3K pathway , 10 m M of PI3K / Akt speci ﬁ c inhibitor , LY294002 was used from 2 h before stretches to 6 h during stretches . At 24 h after stretch , the protein levels of Akt , p - Akt and b - actin were detected to con ﬁ rm if LY294002 could inhibit the expression and / or activity , and the protein level of AR was deter - mined to clarify the effect of LY294002 on AR expression . As shown in Fig . 7 , LY294002 did reduce the activity instead of expression of Akt in C2C12 cells exposed to 15 % or 20 % of stretch . When the ac - tivity of Akt was inhibited , the protein level of AR was signi ﬁ cant down - regulated by both 15 % stretch and 20 % stretch compared with the relative stretched cells , which indicated that IGF - 1 regu - lated AR expression in stretched C2C12 cells was mediated by PI3K / Akt pathway . 3 . 8 . Cyclic mechanical stretch - induced expressions and activities of MAPK ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) in C2C12 cells Neither 15 % stretch nor 20 % stretch exert effect on the expres - sions of p38 ( ratio of p38 / b - actin ) and ERK1 / 2 ( ratio of ERK / b - actin ) in C2C12 cells . However , the activity of p38 re ﬂ ected by the ratio of p - p38 / p38 in protein level was increased by 6 h and 8 h of 15 % stretches , especial by 6 h of 15 % stretch , while no change was found in 6 h and 8 h of 20 % stretches . For ERK1 / 2 , the activity of ERK1 / 2 ( ratio of p - ERK / ERK ) was enhanced in 15 % stretched C2C12 cells for 6 h rather than 8 h , and mitigated by 20 % stretches of 6 h and 8 h , with obvious mitigation in 8 h ( Fig . 8 ) .

Changed protein levels of AR induced by IGF - neutralizing antibody in 15 % stretched C2C12 cells ( Fig . 4A ) and by recombinant IGF - 1 in 20 % stretched C2C12 cells ( Fig . 4B ) . C2C12 cells incubated with IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody ( dosage : 25 , 50 or 100 ng / ml ) and recombinant IGF - 1 ( 200 , 500 or 1000 ng / ml ) for 1 h were undertaken 6 h of 15 % and 20 % stretches , respectively . After stretch , the medium was replaced and cultured for 24 h . Then AR protein levels were detected by Western blot and one of the representative results was shown in the upper of Fig . 4A and B b - actin was used for loading control . Relative expressions of AR were quanti ﬁ ed , normalized and expressed as fold of control and shown in the bottom of Fig . 4A and B . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 vs un - stretched control ; # p < 0 . 05 vs 15 % stretch ; D p < 0 . 05 vs 15 % stretch þ 25 ng / ml IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody ( A ) . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 vs 20 % stretch ; D p < 0 . 05 , DD p < 0 . 01 vs 20 % stretch þ 200 ng / ml recombinant IGF - 1 ( B ) .

Effects of IGF - 1 on the expressions and activities of p38 and ERK1 / 2 regulated by cyclic mechanical stretch in C2C12 cells For quantifying the role of IGF - 1 on the expressions and activ - ities of p38 and ERK1 / 2 resulted from cyclic mechanical stretch in C2C12 cells , IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody ( dosage : 25 , 50 or 100 ng / ml ) and recombinant IGF - 1 ( 200 , 500 or 1000 ng / ml ) were used to inhibit and promote the level of IGF - 1 before 15 % and 20 % stretch , respectively . The increases of activities of p38 and ERK1 / 2 resulted from 6 h of 15 % stretch was decreased by IGF - 1 neutralizing anti - body at a dose dependent manner ( Fig . 9A ) . Recombinant IGF - 1 signi ﬁ cantly up - regulated the activities of p38 ( only at 1000 ng / ml ) and ERK1 / 2 ( at doses of 500 and 1000 ng / ml ) in 6 h of 20 % stretch ( Fig . 9B ) . In addition , IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody and re - combinant IGF - 1 did not alter the expressions of p38 and ERK1 / 2 in stretched C2C12 cells . These results indicated that the modulation of activities of p38 and ERK1 / 2 by cyclic mechanical stretch were mediated by IGF - 1 . 3 . 10 . Effects of p38 and ERK1 / 2 speci ﬁ c inhibitors on the expression of AR in 15 % or 20 % stretched C2C12 cells For clarifying whether the IGF - 1 regulated AR expression was mediated by p38 and ERK1 / 2 pathways , speci ﬁ c inhibitors of p38 ( SB203580 ) and ERK1 / 2 ( U0126 ) were used from 2 h before stretches to 6 h during stretches . At 24 h after stretch , the protein levels of p38 , p - p38 , ERK1 / 2 , p - ERK1 / 2 and b - actinwere detected to con ﬁ rm if SB203580 and U0126 could inhibit the expressions and / or activities of p38 and ERK1 / 2 , respectively . The protein level of AR was determined to clarify the effects of SB203580 and U0126 on AR expression . As shown in Fig . 10A , SB203580 mitigated p38 expression rather than p38 activity in C2C12 cells exposed to 15 % or 20 % of stretch . When p38 expression was inhibited , the protein level of AR in 15 % or 20 % stretched C2C12 cells was decreased compared with the relative stretch control . Similar results were obtained in ERK1 / 2 . The protein level of AR in 15 % or 20 % stretched C2C12 cells was decreased after inhibiting ERK1 / 2 activity but not ERK1 / 2 expression by U0126 ( Fig . 10B ) . These results indicated that the modulation of AR expression by cyclic mechanical stretch were mediated by the activation of p38 and ERK1 / 2 . 4 . Discussion Cellular responses to mechanical stretch can differ depending on details of the applied mechanical stretch such as magnitude , frequency , duration , and type of stretch and the kind of cell examined . In the experiments on C2C12 and skeletal muscle sat - ellites , cyclic mechanical stretches with different magnitude ( 5 % , 10 % , 15 % and 17 % ) , frequency ( 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 1 Hz ) and duration ( 30 min , 1 h , 4 h and 12 h ) were applied , and an increase of pro - liferation and change of differentiation were induced ( Kook et al . , 2008a , b ) ( Kumar et al . , 2004 ) . Cyclic mechanical stretch also pro - moted the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by 10 % elongation ( J . Song et al . , 2012 ) and of bladder smooth muscle cells by 5 % , 10 % and 15 % elongations ( Dai et al . , 2015 ) . However , until now there is no report about proliferation inhibition induced by cyclic mechanical stretch in C2C12 cells , although 20 % cyclic stretch was reported to cause the apoptosis of aortic smooth muscle cells ( Ito et al . , 2015 ) . In the present study , we demonstrated that 15 % cyclic mechanical stretch for 6 h increased the proliferation of C2C12 cells , while 20 % stretch for 6 h or 8 h inhibited the prolif - eration , which indicated that the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts was promoted by appropriate cyclic mechanical stretch and inhibited by overstretch . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst report that 20 % cyclic mechanical stretch mitigated the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts , which provided a stretch condition ( 20 % Fig . 6 . Effects of IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody and recombinant IGF - 1 on stretch - induced alterations of PI3K expression and activity . The alterations of expression and activity of PI3K resulted from IGF - neutralizing antibody in 15 % stretched C2C12 cells ( Fig . 6A ) and from recombinant IGF - 1 in 20 % stretched C2C12 cells ( Fig . 6B ) . The C2C12 cells treated with IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody ( dose : 25 , 50 or 100 ng / ml ) and recombinant IGF - 1 ( 200 , 500 or 1000 ng / ml ) for 1 h were undertaken 15 % and 20 % stretch , respectively . After stretch , the mediumwas replaced and cultured for 24 h . Then the protein levels of p - PI3K , PI3K and b - actinwere detected by Western blot and one of the representativeresults was shown in the upper of Fig . 6A and B . Expression and activity of PI3K were re ﬂ ected by PI3K / b - actin ratio and p - PI3K / PI3K ratio , respectively . Relative activity of PI3K was quanti ﬁ ed , normalized and expressed as fold of control and shown in the bottom of Fig . 6A and B , and relative expression of PI3K ( PI3K / b - actin ) was not shown for no change . * p < 0 . 05 vs un - stretched control ; # p < 0 . 05 vs 15 % stretch ; D p < 0 . 05 vs 15 % stretch þ 25 ng / ml IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody ( A ) . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 vs 20 % stretch ; DD p < 0 . 01 vs 20 % stretch þ 200 ng / ml recombinant IGF - 1 ( B ) .

AR is required for the development of muscle mass and strength in males . Complete AR knockout ( ARKO ) male mouse induces a reduction in multiple skeletal muscles masses such as hind - limb , extensor digitorum longus ( EDL ) and gastrocnemius ( MacLean et al . , 2008 ; Rana et al . , 2014a ) , and a decrease in muscle strength such as total grip strength ( Dubois et al . , 2014 ) and EDL contractile strength ( Rana et al . , 2014a , b ) . Androgen / AR promote muscle growth and hypertrophy by maintaining myoblasts in the prolif - erative state and delaying differentiation as well as increasing protein synthesis ( Dubois et al . , 2012 ; Rana et al . , 2014b ) . The pro - proliferation effect of androgen / AR on skeletal muscles was well demonstrated in in vivo and in vitro ( Dubois et al . , 2012 ) , but whether AR expression in skeletal muscle cells was changed by cyclic mechanical stretch , and whether the changed AR exerted a role on the proliferation of myoblasts or satellite cells were not clear . Our results showed that 15 % of stretch increased AR expres - sion in C2C12 myoblasts accompanied with enhanced proliferation , and 20 % of stretch down - regulated AR expression in C2C12 myo - blasts alongside inhibited cell proliferation . Furthermore , the pro - moted effect of 15 % stretch on the proliferation of C2C12 cells was inhibited by multiply dosages ( 20 , 40 , or 60 m M ) of AR inhibitor , Flutamide , at a dose - dependent manner . These results indicated that the cyclic stretch - regulated proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts was likely to be mediated by AR . How cyclic stretch - induced AR modulated the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts ? It has not been reported . As a member of nuclear receptor family , AR directly affected the transcription of target genes , such as muscle - speci ﬁ c transcription factors and myogenic regulatory factors ( MRFs ) . In addition , anabolic action of AR is partly established through crosstalk with other signaling molecules such as IGF - 1 , Akt and myostatin ( Dubois et al . , 2012 ) ( Rana et al . , 2014a , b ; Dubois et al . , 2014 ) . On one hand , androgens - induced increase of muscle mass was closely related to the activation of IGF - 1 / Akt / mTOR pathway in vivo or vitro ( White et al . , 2013 ) , and Fig . 7 .

Expression and activity of p38 were re ﬂ ected by p38 / b - actin ratio and p - p38 / p38 ratio . Similarly , ERK / b - actin ratio and p - ERK / ERK ratio represented as the expression and activity of ERK1 / 2 . Values are expressed as fold of control and graphed as shown in the bottom of Fig . 8 , without the results of p38 / b - actin ratio and ERK / b - actin ratio for no change . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 vs un - stretched control ; # p < 0 . 05 , # # p < 0 . 01 vs 6 h of relative stretch . Y . Ma et al . / Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 450 ( 2017 ) 83 e 93 89 PI3K / Akt inhibition abolished the testosterone - induced increase of cross section area of skeletal muscles ( Basualto - Alarcon et al . , 2013 ) . On the other hand , in un - stretched C2C12 myoblast IGF - 1 induced the increase of AR in protein level , which was at least partly related to PI3K / Akt pathway ( Lee , 2009 ) . In cyclic mechanical stretch , there is accumulating evidence that cyclic mechanical stretch promoted the proliferation of several cells by increasing secretion of IGF - 1 and activating IGF - 1 / Akt pathway , including cardiac ﬁ broblasts ( Honsho et al . , 2009 ) , vascular smooth muscle cells ( J . Song et al . , 2012 ) and bladder smooth muscle cells ( Tian et al . , 2013 ) . Cyclic mechanical stretch induced vascular remodel - ing of vascular smooth muscle cells by activating Akt signaling ( X . Liu et al . , 2015 ; Seo et al . , 2013 ) . However , in skeletal muscle cells , the study about mechanical stretch on IGF - 1 / Akt / mTOR pathway was rare , and the only one report was that 15 % of stretch activated mTOR of C2C12 cells to increase protein synthesis rather than proliferation ( Nakai et al . , 2015 ) . In the present study , we ﬁ rst reported that the secretion of IGF - 1 was increased by 15 % stretch while decreased by 20 % stretch in C2C12 cells . Furthermore , 15 % stretch - induced increase of AR was reversed by IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody and 20 % stretch - induced decreases of AR was enhanced by recombinant IGF - 1 at a dose - dependent manner , which indi - cated that the effect of stretch on the level of AR in C2C12 cells was mediated by IGF - 1 . In addition , the present study also found that enhanced activity of PI3K by 15 % stretch was reversed by IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody and mitigated activity of PI3K by 20 % stretch was enhanced by recombinant IGF - 1 at a dose - dependent manner , which indicated that the effect of stretch on the activity of PI3K in C2C12 was mediated by IGF - 1 . For clarifying the associ - ation of PI3K / Akt and AR , PI3K activity of C2C12 cells was inhibited by the speci ﬁ c inhibitor of PI3K / Akt , LY294002 , resulting in a sig - ni ﬁ cant decrease of AR protein level in both 15 % and 20 % of stretched cells , which indicated that cyclic stretch - modulated AR expression was via IGF - 1 - PI3K / Akt pathway . Fig . 9 . Effects of IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody and recombinant IGF - 1 on stretch - induced changes of expressions and activities of p38 and ERK1 / 2 . The alterations of ex - pressions and activities of p38 and ERK1 / 2 induced by IGF - neutralizing antibody in 15 % stretched C2C12 cells ( Fig . 9A ) and by recombinant IGF - 1 in 20 % stretched C2C12 cells ( Fig . 6B ) . The C2C12 cells treated with IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody ( dose : 25 , 50 or 100 ng / ml ) and recombinant IGF - 1 ( 200 , 500 or 1000 ng / ml ) for 1 h were undertaken 15 % and 20 % stretch , respectively . After stretch , the medium was replaced and cultured for 24 h . Then the protein levels of p38 , p - p38 , ERK1 / 2 , p - ERK1 / 2 and b - actin were detected by Western blot and one of the representative results was shown in the upper of Fig . 9A and B .

Y . Ma et al . / Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 450 ( 2017 ) 83 e 93 90 It has been reported that multiple cyclic mechanical stretch induced the activations of ERK1 / 2 and p38 in C2C12 myoblasts ( Kook et al . , 2008a , b , Nakai et al . , 2010 , Gao and Carson , 2016 ) and in other cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells ( Hu et al . , 2014 ) , facial hypertrophic scar ﬁ broblasts ( Hu et al . , 2014 ) and bladder smooth muscle cells ( Kawashima et al . , 2015 ) . In the present study , the activities of ERK1 / 2 and p38 were induced by 15 % of stretch and mitigated by 20 % of stretch , accompanied with the increase and decrease of proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts . The important roles of ERK1 / 2 and p38 on the proliferation regulated by cyclic mechanical stretch were demonstrated in C2C12 myoblasts ( Kook et al . , 2008a , b , Nakai et al . , 2010 , Gao and Carson , 2016 ) , and our study got similar results . In fact , the promoted effect of activated ERK1 / 2 on the proliferation and protein synthesis of C2C12 myoblasts was also found by other stress such as low frequency pulsed electro - magnetic ﬁ eld ( Xu et al . , 2016 ) and supplement of methionine ( Zhou et al . , 2016 ) . The association of MAPK with IGF - 1 and IGF - 1R was reported , for example , IGF - 1 and IGF - 1R affected cell prolifer - ation and differentiation via ERK1 / 2 and p38 in human dental pulp stem cells ( Lv et al . , 2016 ) and via ERK1 / 2 in perivascular adipocyte ( P . Liu et al . , 2015 ) and trophectoderm cells ( Jeong et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , MAPK pathways were required for IGF - 1 - induced activation of AR in C2C12 cells , because inhibition of the MAPK pathway with SB203580 , PD98059 , or SP600125 signi ﬁ cantly decreased IGF - 1 - induced AR protein expression and nuclear translocation from cytosol ( Kim and Lee , 2009a , b ) . However , in cyclic stretched cells , the association of AR with IGF - 1 and MAPK remains unclear . To our knowledge , our study ﬁ rst reported that cyclic stretch modulated AR expression at least via IGF - 1 / MAPK ( ERK1 / 2 and p38 ) pathway because of the following results : ① The increases of AR level , activities of ERK1 / 2 and p38 induced by 15 % stretch were reversed by IGF - 1 neutralizing antibody , while the attenuations of AR level , activities of ERK1 / 2 and p38 resulted from 20 % stretch were enhanced by recombinant IGF - 1 in C2C12 cells ; ② Inhibition of p38 and ERK1 / 2 by speci ﬁ c inhibitors SB203580 and U0126 respectively resulted in signi ﬁ cant decreases of AR protein levels in 15 % and 20 % of stretched C2C12 cells . There are some strengths and limitations of our study . Some new discoveries were reported , for example , 20 % of stretch for 6 h or 8 h ( 0 . 5 Hz ) inhibited the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts ; stretch - modulated proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts was likely to be attributed to the alterations of AR expression , and stretch - regulated changes of AR in C2C12 myoblasts were through the mediation of IGF - 1 - PI3K / Akt and IGF - 1 - MAPK ( p38 , ERK1 / 2 ) pathways . The limitations of the study was short of the prolifera - tion result of C2C12 myoblasts when AR was increased by AR Fig . 10 .

After stretch , the medium was replaced and cultured for 24 h , then the cells were collected to determine the protein levels of p38 , p - p38 , ERK1 / 2 , p - ERK1 / 2 and AR by Western blot .
