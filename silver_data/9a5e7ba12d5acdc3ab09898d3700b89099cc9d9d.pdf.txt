SUPPLEMENTAL DATA Identification of nuclear phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate - interacting proteins by neomycin extraction Aurélia E Lewis , Lilly Sommer , Magnus Ø Arntzen , Yvan Strahm , Nicolas Morrice , Nullin Divecha and Clive S D’Santos Supplemental data files present in this document include : 1 . Supplemental Figures S1 - S4 2 . Supplemental Tables S2 - S4 Separate . xls files : Supplemental Table S1 Supplemental Figure S1 250 148 98 64 50 36 22 - + - + neomycin - Triton + Triton Figure S1 , related to Figure 1 : Neomycin displacement of nuclear proteins Jurkat nuclei ( 10 E7 ) were isolated in the presence or absence of 0 . 1 % Triton X100 in the hypotonic buffer . Nuclei obtained from each condition were separated in 2 fractions , washed in retention buffer , and incubated in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of 5 mM neomycin , releasing a number of specific proteins into the supernatant . Supernatants were resolved by 1D - SDS - PAGE and proteins were stained with Coomassie blue . The same pattern of proteins can be observed in both conditions . Figures S2 and S3 , related to Figures 3A and 3B : GO network visualisation of Figure 3A and B for the neomycin - displaced nuclear proteins dataset . Nodes in yellow and orange are the most significantly overrepresented categories ( the most significant nodes are in orange ) . White nodes are not significantly overrepresented but are included to show the significantly overrepresented nodes in the context of the whole GO hierarchy ( for both Biological processes and Molecular functions ) . The area of a node is proportional to the number of genes in the test set annotated to the corresponding GO category . The nodes that are circled in blue represent the common nodes that were determined to be enriched when the analysis was done only with proteins with PI - binding domains .
