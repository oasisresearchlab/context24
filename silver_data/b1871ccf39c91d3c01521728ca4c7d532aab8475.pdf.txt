We report the structure of a J domain complexed with a J responsive portion of a mammalian Hsp70 . The J domain activates ATPase activity by directing the linker that con - nects the Hsp70 nucleotide binding domain ( NBD ) and substrate binding domain ( SBD ) toward a hydrophobic patch on the NBD surface . Binding of the J domain to Hsp70 displaces the SBD from the NBD , which may allow the SBD ﬂexibility to capture diverse substrates . Unlike prokaryotic Hsp70 , the SBD and NBD of the mammalian chaperone interact in the ADP state . Thus , although both nucleotides and J cochaperones modulate Hsp70 NBD : linker and NBD : SBD interactions , the intrinsic persis - tence of those interactions differs in different Hsp70s and this may optimize their activities for different cellular roles . INTRODUCTION ATP hydrolysis in the Hsp70 NBD drives cycles of confor - mational changes in the SBD , leading alternately to bind - ing and release of protein substrates ( Mayer et al . , 2001 ) . Cycles of substrate binding and release by these motors are harnessed by cellular machineries to refold or remodel proteins and protein complexes or to move proteins between subcellular compartments ( Sousa and Lafer , 2006 ) . Hsp70s alone have broad substrate speciﬁcity ( Rudiger et al . , 1997 ) , low ATPase rates , and little chaper - one activity . Speciﬁcation , activation , and coordination of Hsp70 activity is achieved by J cochaperones ( James et al . , 1997 ; Misselwitz et al . , 1998 ) . These proteins display a J domain that binds Hsp70s and stimulates their ATPase activity and one or more accessory domains that bind and present substrates to the chaperone ( Walsh et al . , 2004 ) . SomeHsp70swillinteractwithmultipleJcochaperones , whereas others are speciﬁc for a single J protein ( Walsh etal . , 2004 ) . Thebasisforsuchspeciﬁcityisnotwellunder - stood but is , at least in part , believed to reside in sequence variations within the J domain of the cochaperone ( Hen - nessy et al . , 2005 ) . An obstacle to structural studies of these interactions is their transience and ATP depen - dence : upon ATP hydrolysis , the J cochaperone : Hsp70 complex dissociates ( Bukau and Horwich , 1998 ; Missel - witz et al . , 1999 ) . The NBD is believed to make the primary interactions with the J domain of the cochaperone ( Gari - mella et al . , 2006 ; Suh et al . , 1998 ) and is also the recipient of its ATPase activating signal , but isolated NBDs are not stimulated by J cochaperones ( Laufen et al . , 1999 ) . It is not clear if this reﬂects a requirement for direct SBD : J co - chaperone contacts or a requirement for the presence of the SBD to allow the Hsp70 to undergo the ATP - driven conformational change that then allows it to bind the cochaperone . One of the better - characterized J cochaperone : Hsp70 pairs is the c onstitutively expressed mammalian Hs c 70 and the neuronal - speciﬁc J cochaperone auxilin . Auxilin contains a J domain and a clathrin binding domain ( Hol - stein et al . , 1996 ; Ungewickell , 1985 ; Ungewickell et al . , 1997 ) . Together , auxilin and Hsc70 remove clathrin coats from clathrin - coated vesicles during synaptic vesicle recy - cling ( Chappell et al . , 1986 ; Morgan et al . , 2001 ; Unge - wickell et al . , 1995 ) . Structures of the auxilin J domain are known ( Gruschus et al . , 2004 ; Jiang et al . , 2003 ) , as is the structure of a bovine Hsc70 that contains both the NBD and SBD but is missing the 10 kD C - terminal oligo - merization domain ( denoted the two - domain Hsc70 or Hsc70 D C ) ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) . Here we describe the struc - ture of auxilin J domain complexed with bovine Hsc70 NBD and with an Hsc70 that lacks the SBD but contains both the NBD and the interdomain linker central to the al - losteric mechanism of DnaK and mammalian Hsc70 . The linker confers a high basal ATPase rate and J domain re - sponsiveness on the NBD , and J domain binding alters linker conformation , directing it toward a hydrophobic patch on the NBD that transmits the J signal from the linker to the nucleotide in the active site . J domain binding to the NBD requires displacement of the NBD : SBD interaction . This could allow the SBD a greater range of motion so as to accept diverse substrates presented by different J cochaperones . 422 Molecular Cell 28 , 422 – 433 , November 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . Unlike what has been reported ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) for E . coli Hsp70 ( DnaK ) , we ﬁnd that bovine Hsc70 NBD and SBD interact in the ADP state of the chaperone . The picture of Hsp70 regulation that emerges is one in which both the nucleotide and J domain modulate NBD : SBD and NBD : linker interactions to control Hsp70 kinetics and in which the persistence of such interactions may dif - fer in different Hsp70s to tune different Hsp70s for their different cellular roles . RESULTS The Interdomain Linker Confers a Constitutively High ATPase Rate and J Cochaperone Sensitivity on the NBD Isolated Hsp70 NBDs and substrate - free Hsp70s exhibit low basal ATPase rates ( Szabo et al . , 1994 ) . Binding of protein substrate to the SBD stimulates this constitutively low ATPase rate several fold . A fragment of DnaK that lacks the SBD but contains the NBD ( aa 1 – 382 ) and the in - terdomain linker ( aa 383 – 392 ) exhibits a constitutively high ATPase rate ( Swain et al . , 2007 ; Vogel et al . , 2006 ) . To de - termine if the corresponding fragment of a mammalian Hsc70 would also exhibit a high basal ATPase rate , we measured single - turnover ATPase rates for a bovine Hsc70 construct that encompasses the NBD ( aa 1 – 383 ) and interdomain linker ( aa 384 – 394 ) . ATPase rates for intact Hsc70 , for a functional Hsc70 in which the C - termi - nal 10 kD oligomerization domain is deleted ( Hsc70 D C ) , for the Hsc70 NBD ( aa 1 – 386 ) alone , and for a fragment that encompasses the NBD and interdomain linker ( NBD _ Linker : aa 1 – 394 ) are presented in Figure 1A . The ATPase rate of Hsc70 is stimulated by auxilin J domain ( ‘‘ + J’’ : aa 810 – 910 ) and by 1 m M Hsc70 substrate peptide ( ‘‘ + Pep’’ , seq : ALLLSAPRRGAGKKC ) . The basal ATPase rate of Hsc70 D C is higher than that of Hsc70 , because it is autostimulated by binding of its unfolded C terminus in its substrate - binding site and it is not further stimulated by a substrate peptide ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) , but it is stimu - lated by the J domain . The low ATPase rate of the isolated NBD is not stimulated by the J domain , indicating that ei - ther the SBD or linker , or both , is required for J cochaper - one stimulation . The basal ATPase rate of the NBD _ Linker is (cid:2) 10 - fold higher than that of Hsc70 and is further stimu - lated by the J domain . When we compare the fold stimu - lation in ATPase rates of the Hsc70 D C and NBD _ Linker as a function of J domain concentration , we ﬁnd that both enzymes are maximally stimulated 5 - to 6 - fold by J domain , but the J domain concentration required for half - maximal stimulation of Hsc70 D C is 1 . 5 m M , while half - maximal stimulation with the NBD _ Linker requires a 10 - fold higher J domain concentration ( Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . We conclude that ( 1 ) the presence of the interdomain linker confers a high basal ATPase rate on the NBD of mammalian Hsc70 , just as is seen with bacterial DnaK ; ( 2 ) the linker also confers J domain sensitivity on the NBD ; and ( 3 ) because the maximal stimulation of the ATPase rate is similar for Hsc70 and the NBD _ Linker , but requires a higher J domain concentration with the latter , the J domain may make interactions with the SBD that are important for J domain : Hsc70 afﬁnity , but not for stimulation of ATP hydrolysis . Preparation and Crystallization of Functional Disulﬁde - Linked J Domain : Hsc70 Complexes Efforts to crystallize NBD or NBD _ Linker complexed with J domain yielded crystals of the individual proteins , but never of the complex , irrespective of the nucleotides or analogs present during crystallization . This may be a con - sequence of the low afﬁnity and ATP requirement of the Hsc70 : auxilin interaction . Though mutant Hsc70s that eliminate ATP hydrolysis have been identiﬁed , these mu - tations also abolish the conformational change in Hsc70 that allows it to bind the J cochaperone ( Johnson and McKay , 1999 ) . Nor could we identify nonhydrolysable analogs that stabilized Hsc70 or the NBD _ Linker in the J - binding competent conformation . We therefore sought Figure 1 .

Cysteines were substituted for D876 and R171 of auxilin J domain and Hsc70 , respectively . These correspond to residues in DnaJ and DnaK that , by genetic cosuppression , are suggested to interact in the DnaJ : DnaK complex ( Suh et al . , 1998 ) . Air oxidation of D876C J domain with R171C Hsc70 NBD or NBD _ Linker led to formation of disulﬁde - linked complexes , whereas control experiments with D847C or D849C J domains ex - hibited little complex formation ( Figure S2 ) . The presence of ATP enhanced formation of the complex with the NBD _ Linker , but not with the NBD alone . To determine whether the J domain was coupled to the Hsc70 in a functionally relevant manner , we compared AT - Pase rate stimulation by J domain in solution to that in the disulﬁde - linked complex . The basal ATPase rate of the R171C NBD _ Linker is not stimulated by 10 m M D876C J domain ( Figure 1B ) . This may reﬂect reduced afﬁnity of the D876C J domain for R171C NBD _ Linker , consistent with results that mutation of the corresponding residues in DnaK or DnaJ reduces DnaJ : DnaK afﬁnity ( Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Suh et al . , 1998 ) . That this is true is indicated by the observation that a high J domain concentration overcomes this reduced afﬁnity and leads to stimulation of R171C NBD _ Linker ATPase by D876C J domain ( Figure 1B , ‘‘ + 500 m M J’’ ) . Thus , the cysteines introduced into the J domain or NBD _ Linker reduce the afﬁnity of this interaction but do not abrogate ATPase stimulation . The ATPase rate of the disulﬁde crosslinked R171C NBD _ Linker : D876C J domain complex ( Figure 1B , ‘‘X J’’ ) is 10 - to 11 - fold greater than that of R171C NBD _ Linker alone . The linked J domain is therefore interacting with the NBD _ Linker in a manner that stimulates the latter’s AT - Pase rate . In fact , the fold stimulation in the ATPase rate by the crosslinked J domain is (cid:2) 2 - fold greater than seen with the wild - type ( WT ) Hsc70 and J domain in solution ( Figure 1A and Figure S1 ) , possibly as a consequence of the covalent linkage holding the J domain on the NBD _ Linker more persistently in a conﬁguration that leads to ATPase stimulation . In agreement with data obtained with the WT NBD , the R171C NBD is not stimulated by the J domain even when the latter is added at very high concentrations ( Figure 1B , R171C NBD , ‘‘ + 500 m M J’’ ) . Furthermore , even when the R171C NBD is crosslinked to the J domain ( Figure 1B , ‘‘X J’’ ) , its ATPase rate is not enhanced . This reveals that the inability of the NBD to be stimulated by the J domain is not due to the latter failing to bind or binding inappropriately to the NBD , because when identically crosslinked to the NBD and NBD _ Linker , the J domain stimulates the ATPase rate of the latter , but not the former . Instead , these observations show that the linker is both necessary and sufﬁcient to confer J domain sensitivity on the NBD . Because these assays revealed that the J domain is crosslinked to the Hsc70 in a functional ( ATPase stimulat - ing ) conﬁguration , we screened both NBD : J domain and NBD _ Linker : J domain complexes for crystallization and obtained crystals of ADP * Pi and AMPPNP forms . Struc - tures of the auxilin J domain and Hsc70 NBD in isolation had been previously determined , but to allow for compar - ison of the structures of all of these proteins in their iso - lated versus J domain complexed forms , we also deter - mined crystal structures of the isolated NBD _ Linker in different nucleotide states . Limited statistics on these structures are presented in Table 1 and full statistics in Table S1 . The Intermolecular Interface in the Complex Identiﬁes Residues Critical for the J Cochaperone : Hsc70 Interaction The J domain is bound in the cleft between lobes IA and IIA of the Hsc70 NBD , with the Hsc70 interdomain linker and the linker - proximal portion of this cleft forming the Hsc70 side of the intermolecular interface ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Though the crosslinked complex in solution is functional , as shown by effects on NBD ATPase rates , the two part - ners in this complex can rotate about the disulﬁde linkage , so it is possible that the crystal has captured a nonfunc - tional orientation of the J domain . If this structure does reveal the functional complex , then it should corroborate previous analyses of J cochaperone : Hsp70 interactions and should predict previously unidentiﬁed interactions . The intermolecular interactions in the crystal bury 1028 A ˚ of protein surface and involve most of J domain helix 3 and the helix 2 C terminus ( including the signature ‘‘HPD’’ motif ; Figures 2A – 2C ) . These are the elements identiﬁed Table 1 .

Molecular Cell J Cochaperone Regulation of Hsp70 by NMR and mutational analysis in polyomavirus T antigen J domain ( PyJ ) as binding mammalian Hsc70 ( Fewell et al . , 2002 ; Garimella et al . , 2006 ; Whalen et al . , 2005 ) . The intermolecular interaction involves H bonds be - tween the J domain H784 imidazole ring and the Hsc70 L170 carbonyl ( Figure S2 ) and between the D896 and S385 side chains ( Figure 2C ) . L380 and I179 make hydro - phobic interactions with F891 and HP874 , 875 . The V388 side and main chains , respectively , pack on M892 and M889 . The C - terminal portion of the turn between J domain helix 2 and 3 ( aa 878 – 885 ) and aliphatic elements of the E884 and Q885 side chains are packed against the I216 side chain . In addition to these direct interactions , there are several water - mediated H bonds contributed by the main - and side - chain atoms of residues identiﬁed in Figure 2C . Many of these residues have been previously shown to be important for Hsp70 interaction with the J co - chaperone . Mutations in the Hsc70 or DnaK interdomain linker reduce or eliminate J domain stimulation of ATPase activity ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ; Laufen et al . , 1999 ) , and muta - tions of V388 and L393 reduce binding to auxilin , as do mutations of Hsc70 I216 ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) . Signiﬁcantly , I216 mutants were identiﬁed as exceptional among sev - eral of the Hsc70 mutants , in that they exhibited the most severe effects on auxilin binding and auxilin - depen - dent clathrin coat disassembly but had less severe effects on ATP - dependent Hsc70 conformational changes , lead - ing to the speculation that I216 mutations affect confor - mational mechanisms in Hsc70 that were not detected in the assays used ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) . This speculation now appears unwarranted , as the effects of the I216 mu - tants are most simply explained as due to direct effects on auxilin binding . Finally , Gross and colleagues previ - ously identiﬁed not only DnaK R167 ( corresponding to Hsc70 R171 ) but also N170 and T173 ( corresponding to N174 and T177 ) as important for the DnaJ : DnaK interac - tion ( Suh et al . , 1998 ) . Both of these residues form part of the intermolecular interface in the complex ( Figure 2C ) and part of a network of water - mediated H bonds that includes J domain residues T879 and E884 . To test the ability of the complex structure to predict new interactions , we constructed an Hsc70 L380G mu - tant . This mutant was unresponsive to the J domain ( Fig - ure 3 ) , consistent with an important role for this residue in the J domain interaction . We also characterized the abil - ityoftheJdomaintostimulatetheATPaseactivity ofapre - viously described set of Hsc70 mutants ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) . Most of these mutants were similar to WT in their re - sponse to the J domain ( data not shown ) , though some actually exhibited increased stimulation ( Figure 6 ) . As expected , an I216T mutant was not stimulated by the J domain ( Figure 3 ) , and at low J domain concentrations , V388C and L393C mutants were also unresponsive ( data not shown ) . Unexpectedly , at high J domain concentra - tions , the ATPase rates of the linker mutants were inhibited (cid:2) 3 - fold by J ( Figure 3 ) . This result highlights the central role of the interdomain linker in mediating the response to J domain : sufﬁciently high concentrations of J can over - come the lower afﬁnity of the linker mutants , but the result - ing complex is catalytically inhibited . J Domain Binding Modulates Linker Conformation Although the structure of the auxilin J domain ( PDB 1NZ6 ) has been previously determined ( Jiang et al . , 2003 ) , struc - tures of an Hsp70 NBD _ Linker fragment have not been previously described . We therefore determined structures Figure 2 .

The conformations of the J domain and aa 1 – 382 of the NBD in the free and complexed states were similar with mean root - mean - square differences of 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 A˚ , but the linker conformation in the complex differed from that seen in the isolated NBD _ Linker or two - domain Hsc70 ( PDB 1YUW ) . Structures of the isolated NBD _ Linker in nu - cleotide - free , ADP , and ADP * Vi states revealed electron density only to aa 384 , as did crystals of isolated NBDs ( aa 1 – 386 ) in ADP * Vi or nucleotide - free conformations . Therefore , even though the presence of the linker alters the biochemical properties of the NBD ( Figure 1 ) , it is dis - ordered in the structure of the isolated NBD _ Linker . This suggests either that all three NBD _ Linker structures have captured a state that is not reﬂective of the linker conformation in solution or that the ATPase stimulating effect of the linker is mediated by transient interactions with the NBD that may be stabilized by J domain binding to stimulate ATPase activity . Consistent with the latter idea , in the crystal of the NBD _ Linker : J domain complex , clear electron density for the linker extends to residue 386 , and weaker electron density consistent with two alternate linker conformations extends to residue 390 ( Figure 4 ; the absence of electron density for the complete linker does not reﬂect proteoly - sis , as mass spectrometry analysis of dissolved crystals revealed that in over 90 % of the sample the linker extends to residue 394 with the remaining fraction corresponding to a fragment that extends to aa 393 ) . In one of these con - formations ( Figure 4B : ‘‘Linker in’’ ) the linker approaches Hsc70 residues I181 and Y371 . These correspond , re - spectively , to DnaK L177 and I373 , both identiﬁed by NMR chemical shift analysis as residues likely to contact the linker in a DnaK NBD _ Linker fragment ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) . To determine if these residues are , in fact , involved in mediating the ATPase stimulating effect of the interdo - main linker and the J cochaperone , we constructed I181A and Y371A mutants and measured their ATPase rates in the absence and presence of the J domain ( Figure 4C ) . The unstimulated ATPase activity of I181A is modestly higher than that of the WT enzyme , but addition of J do - main inhibits the ATPase activity of I181A (cid:2) 10 - fold , an ef - fect that is qualitatively similar , but quantitatively greater , than that seen with the V388C and L393C linker mutants . Y371A , on the other hand , exhibits a 7 - fold increase in its unstimulated ATPase rate , relative to WT , but this higher rate is stimulated only (cid:2) 1 . 4 - fold by the J cochaperone . Y371A therefore appears to be constitutively J stimulated and unresponsive to further J stimulation , while the I181A phenotype implies that inappropriate NBD : linker interac - tions in the J cochaperone complex can strongly catalyti - cally inhibit the NBD . These phenotypes , together with our X - ray and previous NMR results ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) , sug - gest a direct role for Y371 and I181 in mediating the ATPase stimulating effect of the J cochaperone through interactions with the interdomain linker . Elements of Transmission of the J Signal to the NBD Active Site The nucleotide and active - site structures of free and J do - main - complexed NBDs with bound ADP * Pi are similar and do not reveal how J stimulates ATPase activity . Crystals of NBD _ Linker : J domain complexed with the slowly hydro - lyzed analog AMPPNP were therefore prepared . These crystals grew under identical conditions as the ADP * Pi crystals and in the same space group and unit cell ( Table S1 ) , but data from these crystals were consistently more mosaic than from the ADP * Pi crystals , with poorer elec - tron density and higher B factors in the reﬁned structures ( Table S1 ) , implying a higher degree of disorder or ﬂexibil - ity in the AMPPNP versus ADP * Pi crystals . In the active site , electron density for the base , ribose , and a - and b - phosphates of the AMPPNP was identical to that seen in the ADP * Pi crystals , but the electron density suggested two locations for the g - phosphate , one corresponding to the Pi seen in the product ( ADP * Pi ) complex and the other corresponding to a g - phosphate in intact AMPPNP , sug - gesting that the AMPPNP crystal is composed of a mixture of intact and hydrolyzed forms of nucleotide . The NBD _ Linker : AMPPNP * J domain structure was compared to that of an isolated AMPPNP * NBD ( Flaherty et al . , 1994 ) . If these structures are superimposed by op - timizing the alignment of the ribose , a - , and b - phosphates of their respective nucleotides , then the g - phosphate in the NBD _ Linker : J domain complex is seen to be shifted by 3 . 5 A ˚ toward E175 , and residues 172 – 181 are shifted by 0 . 6 – 1 . 3 A ˚ between the two structures ( Figure 5A ; these shifts are larger than the overall coordinate errors , esti - mated at 0 . 1 – 0 . 15 A ˚ for the 1 . 7 A ˚ ADP * Pi structures and 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 A ˚ for the 2 . 2 A ˚ AMPPNP structure ; Table S1 ) . The latter changes involve elements that interact with the J domain ( aa 172 – 177 ) or that mediate transduction Figure 3 .

Molecular Cell J Cochaperone Regulation of Hsp70 of the J signal to the NBD through interactions with the linker ( aa181 ) . Itisunclearifthesesmall , localizedchanges can explain how the J domain stimulates Hsc70 ATPase activity . It is possible that the activated conformation of the ATPase is not revealed in this structure , either because that conformation is transient or because AMPPNP does not stabilize that conformation or crystal packing interac - tions inhibit its formation . However , catalysis at the Hsc70 ATPase site is sensitive to small changes in the po - sition of catalytic groups ( Wilbanks and McKay , 1998 ) , and the 5 - to 6 - fold stimulation in ATPase rates conferred by theJdomain could be induced , atleast inpart , through rel - atively small local changes in the structure of Hsc70 ele - ments that interact with both the ATP and the J domain or linker . Inspection of Figure 5A suggests that E175 , whichhasbeenpreviouslyshowntobecatalyticallyimpor - tant ( Johnson and McKay , 1999 ) and is within a stretch of residues that interact with the J domain and that transmit the J signal from the linker to the NBD , could be an ac - tive - site residue that transmits the J signal directly to the nucleotide . ThiswouldpredictthatmutationofE175would affect the ability of the Hsc70 to be stimulated by the J do - main . To test this , we constructed and characterized an E175S NBD _ Linker mutant . Ultraﬁltration conﬁrmed that thismutantassociateswiththeJdomaininanATP - depen - dent manner . The basal ATPase rate of E175S is 100 - fold lower than that of the WT NBD _ Linker ( Figure 5B ) . This low rate is not stimulated by the J domain but is , in fact , reduced 30 % – 40 % by J ( Figure 5B , ‘‘ + J’’ ) . Failure to be stimulated by the J domain is not simply an attribute of any catalytically compromised mutant , as we tested an active - site T204A mutant that had an 8 - fold lower basal ATPase rate and found that it was still responsive to J do - main stimulation ( data not shown ) . Instead , these results are consistent with involvement of E175 in transmission of the J signal to the nucleotide . Figure 4 .

To test this , we prepared a two - domain Hsc70 in which the SBD and NBD are locked by a disulﬁde between cysteines substituted for D152 and K524 in the NBD and SBD , respectively . Though the distance be - tween these two residues’ a carbons ( 8 . 5 A ˚ ) is not optimal for a disulﬁde , air oxidation of D152C / K524C leads to for - mation of a disulﬁde - bonded species in (cid:2) 80 % of the mol - ecules , as assessed by migration on nonreducing versus reducing SDS - PAGE ( inset in Figure 6B ; the remaining 20 % cannot be induced to form a disulﬁde , cannot be re - moved with thiol - Sepharose , and may represent mixed sulfoxides ) . Single ( D152C or K542C ) mutants and WT en - zymes showed no shifts in migration upon similar treat - ment ( data not shown ) . ATPase rates for the WT enzyme Figure 5 .

The inset gel of D152C / K524C resolved on SDS - PAGE under reducing or oxidizing conditions shows that (cid:2) 80 % of the enzyme forms a faster - migrating , disulﬁde - bonded species in the oxidizing environment . 428 Molecular Cell 28 , 422 – 433 , November 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . Molecular Cell J Cochaperone Regulation of Hsp70 measured under oxidizing or reducing conditions were similar and were both increased (cid:2) 5 - fold by addition of saturating levels of J domain ( Figure 6B ; oxidation / reduc - tion also did not affect the basal or stimulated ATPase rates of the single mutants ) . The unstimulated ATPase rates of the oxidized or reduced D152C / K524C mutant were also similar but were 2 - to 3 - fold greater than the unstimulated rate of the WT enzyme ( Figure 6B ) . The in - creased basal ATPase rate is a consequence of mutation of D152 and has been noted previously in Hsc70 ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) and for mutants of the corresponding D148 in DnaK ( Gassler et al . , 1998 ) . The ATPase activity of reduced D152C / K524C enzyme is strongly stimulated ( (cid:2) 20 - fold ) by J domain , but the degree of stimulation of the oxidized enzyme is only (cid:2) 20 % of that seen with the reduced form ( Figure 6B ) . This residual stimulation can be entirely accounted for by the (cid:2) 20 % that does not form a disulﬁde bond upon air oxidation . Because oxida - tion / reduction does not affect basal or stimulated ATPase rates of the WT or singly mutated enzymes , this indicates that it is the interdomain linkage that inhibits J domain stimulation of ATPase activity and that such stimulation requires displacement of the NBD : SBD interaction . The Mammalian Hsc70 NBD and SBD Interact in the ADP State The observation that a crosslink between the SBD and NBD abrogates Hsc70 response to the J domain implies that J binding modulates NBD : SBD interactions ( and vice versa ) . Nucleotide binding is also believed to regulate interdomain interactions . Because we are able to induce formation of a disulﬁde bond between the NBD and SBD under nucleotide - free conditions , this suggests that the NBD and SBD interact , at least transiently , under such conditions . The crystal structure of a functional two - domain Hsc70 in a nucleotide - free state reveals extensive interdomaininteractions ( Jiangetal . , 2005 ) . However , are - cent NMR study of E . coli DnaK concluded that the NBD and SBD interact only when ATP binds and that in the ADP and nucleotide - free states ( which are believed to be conformationally similar ) the two domains do not interact and behave like ‘‘beads on a string’’ ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) . The latter conclusion would be at odds with an analysis of deuterium exchange in DnaK that concluded that , even in the nucleotide - free state , the NBD and SBD in DnaK mutually stabilize each others’ structures , as re - vealed by reductions in deuteron exchange rates in the in - tact enzyme versus the isolated domains ( Rist et al . , 2006 ) . However , it’s possible that transient interdomain interac - tions in the two - domain DnaK are sufﬁcient to induce mutual structural stabilization . The conclusion that the NBD and SBD in DnaK do not interact in the ADP or nucle - otide - free states was based on the observation that the peaks for an isolated NBD ( or SBD ) in an HSQC spectrum wereidenticaltothecorresponding peaksinatwo - domain DnaKunlessATPwaspresent ( Swainet al . , 2007 ) . Toseeif a similar result would be obtained with bovine Hsc70 , we collected HSQC spectra for the ADP states of an isolated NBD and a two - domain Hsc70 ( Figure 7 ) . Superposition of these spectra reveals many peaks from the NBD spec - trum ( red and purple outlines in Figure 7 ) that are either missing or chemically shifted in the spectrum of the two - domain protein ( black and gray peaks ) . This indicates changes in the chemical environment of many residues in the NBD versus two - domain enzyme as well as peak broadening in the two - domain Hsc70 , due either to its larger size and / or exchange between multiple conforma - tions . An effective understanding of these conformational mechanisms will require a more extensive NMR analysis , but inspection of the spectra in Figure 7 reveals that , what - everthecaseforDnaK , bovineHsc70intheADPstatecan - not be described as two noninteracting domains . DISCUSSION Approaches analogous to that described here , in which a disulﬁde bond is used to stabilize a protein : protein com - plex for crystallization , were previously used to crosslink HIV - 1 RT and DNAP I to DNA to restrict the lateral mobility of these proteins on their templates and facilitate crystal - lization ( Beese et al . , 1993 ; Huang et al . , 1998 ) . The crystal structure of a protein : protein complex crosslinked by engineered cysteines has also been described ( Guo et al . , 2004 ) but , in that case , corresponded to a stable complex Figure 7 .

Molecular Cell 28 , 422 – 433 , November 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 429 Molecular Cell J Cochaperone Regulation of Hsp70 whose structure had previously been determined without crosslinks . Here we have used crosslinking to crystallize a transient and previously uncrystallized protein : protein complex . Such an approach can be generally applied to study transiently interacting proteins , but biochemical data must conﬁrm the functional relevance of such linked complexes . In our case , not only is the complex structure able to account for and predict intermolecular interactions identiﬁed by mutational and NMR analyses ( Figure 2 ) , but we also demonstrate its functionality in its higher ATPase activity relative to the isolated Hsc70 ( Figure 1B ) . This al - lows us to unambiguously conclude that the interdomain linker is required to transmit the J signal to Hsc70 and not merely for J cochaperone binding , because we ob - serve ATPase stimulation in the NBD _ Linker : J domain complex , but not in the NBD : J domain complex ( even though the structures reveal J domain bound in identical orientations in both complexes ) . A role for the linker in Hsp70 allostery was ﬁrst sug - gested by observations of alternate conformations of a partial linker in a DnaK SBD fragment ( Zhu et al . , 1996 ) . A central role for the linker in Hsp70 mechanism was explicitly proposed based on a characterization of 23 Hsc70 mutants that revealed that direct or allosteric disruption of an ATP - driven reduction in linker accessibil - ity to protease resulted in loss of chaperone function ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) . It was proposed that this ATP - driven change in linker conformation involved insertion of the ex - posed linker into a hydrophobic patch in the Hsc70 inter - domain interface . Analysis of deuterium exchange rates in DnaK conﬁrmed that ATP binding induced a transition in the linker from a solvent exposed to buried state ( Rist et al . , 2006 ) . In the structures described here , the J domain induces ordering of most of the linker , which is otherwise invisible in electron density maps of the NBD _ Linker alone . In one of the two observed conformations , the linker is directed toward a hydrophobic patch on the NBD sur - face ( Figure 4B ) . This patch includes amino acids Y371 and I181 , whose DnaK homologs ( I373 and L177 ) were identiﬁed by NMR as residues with which the linker may in - teract to activate the ATPase ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) . The phe - notypes of Y731A and I181A support their identiﬁcation as key residues through which the J cochaperone stimulates Hsc70 ATPase activity ( Figure 4C ) . These data indicate that transmission of the J signal follows the pathway J / Linker / ( Y371 , I181 ) . Subsequent steps in the transmission of this signal , which must reach into the active site , are less certain be - cause it is unclear if the small differences in nucleotide and active - site structure between an AMPPNP * NBD structure and an AMPNP * J * NBD _ Linker structure explain J stimula - tion of Hsc70 ATPase activity . However , the DnaK active - site residue E171 was previously identiﬁed as important in DnaK allostery ( Buchberger et al . , 1994 ) and possibly in regulation by DnaJ ( Fan et al . , 2003 ) . The corresponding residue in Hsc70 is E175 , and given its 100 - fold contribu - tion to rate enhancement and proximity to residues that interact with the J domain and mediate ATPase stimula - tion , a role for this residue in transmission of the J signal to the nucleotide is plausible and is supported by the ob - servation that its mutation abolishes J stimulation ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . An important question is whether unstimulated and J - stimulated ATP hydrolysis proceed through the same conformational state . It would be simplest to explain J stimulation as occurring by stabilization of NBD : linker in - teractions that form even in the absence of the J cocha - perone . This is especially so because , even in the absence of the J cochaperone , ATP binding leads to a reduction in linker accessibility that could most easily be explained if the linker is interacting identically with the same hydro - phobic patch with which it interacts during J - stimulated ATP hydrolysis . However , our mutational analyses may rule out this simple explanation . Mutation of linker residue V388 or L393 or of NBD I181 causes the Hsc70 ATPase rate to be inhibited , rather than stimulated , by the J cocha - perone ( Figures 3 and 4 ) , with the I181A mutant exhibiting a dramatic 10 - fold inhibition of its ATPase rate by the J co - chaperone ( corresponding to 50 - to 60 - fold inhibition when compared to the J - stimulated rate of WT Hsc70 ) . However , these mutations have no effect on the unstimu - lated ATPase rate . If unstimulated and J - stimulated ATP hydrolysis depend on identical linker : I181 interactions that are simply stabilized by the cochaperone , then the I181 and linker mutations should affect both stimulated and unstimulated ATPase rates . Instead , these observa - tions suggest that NBD : linker interactions differ during J - stimulated and unstimulated ATP hydrolysis . However , the ATP - driven conformational change in the linker may be coupled to partial disruption of the NBD : SBD interaction ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) and is required for J cochaperone binding to Hsc70 ( Misselwitz et al . , 1999 , 1998 ) . In fact , we ﬁnd that displacement of the SBD from the NBD is required to allow J domain to bind as well as to allow linker access to the hydrophobic patch on the NBD that is otherwise buried by the SBD ( Figure 6A ) . Interestingly , the ATPase rate of the D152C / K524C mutant is stimulated (cid:2) 4 - fold more than the WT Hsc70 by the J domain ( Figure 6B ) . The singly substituted enzymes show an identical quantitative increase in their response to the J domain ( data not shown ) and were also shown to display enhanced binding to auxilin ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) . We do not fully understand such effects , but these mutations may weaken NBD : SBD interactions to facilitate SBD displacement and productive J domain binding . This displacement may have other functions . Substrates presented by J proteins to Hsp70s are hetero - geneous ( i . e . , denatured proteins or protein aggregates ) , and many Hsp70s work with multiple J cochaperones , each of which will have a distinct substrate presentation domain . It seems unlikely that these different J cochaper - ones will all present their distinct and heterogeneous sub - strates to the Hsp70 with identical geometry . Displace - ment of the SBD from the NBD could allow the SBD to sample a wider range of positions so as to increase its possibility of capturing substrate . 430 Molecular Cell 28 , 422 – 433 , November 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . Molecular Cell J Cochaperone Regulation of Hsp70 These results reveal a picture of Hsp70 regulation in which not only the nucleotide , but also the J cochaperone , modulates NBD : SBD and NBD : linker interactions , but our conclusion that the SBD and NBD of mammalian Hsc70 interact in the ADP state ( Figures 5 and 6 ) differs from that reached in a recent study of a two - domain DnaK ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) . Other studies have also suggested that the equilibria between different conformational states may be set differently in different Hsp70s . Although NMR analyses of a two - domain E . coli DnaK indicate that these domains interact only in the ATP state ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) , similar studies of a two - domain T . thermophilus DnaK concluded that ‘‘the nucleotide binding domain and sub - strate binding domain are closely associated in all ligand states , ’’ with the interdomain interface being tighter in the ADP versus ATP state ( Revington et al . , 2005 ) . These differences might be attributed to differences in the nature of the mutations and truncations introduced into these two - domain proteins to facilitate their characterization ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) , rather than to intrinsic species differ - ences in conformational equilibria . However , even com - parison of WT NBDs from different Hsp70s reveals varia - tions in intrinsic conformational dynamics . Thus , NMR studies indicate that the T . thermophilus DnaK NBD in the ADP state is in slow exchange between two conforma - tions that collapse into a single conformation when ATP binds ( Revington et al . , 2004 ) . The E . coli DnaK NBD ap - parently exhibits the opposite behavior and is conforma - tionally more heterogeneous in the ATP versus ADP state ( Swain et al . , 2007 ) , whereas the bovine Hsc70 NBD ex - hibits exchange between multiple conformations in both ATP and ADP states ( Zhang and Zuiderweg , 2004 ) . It is possible that all Hsp70s share the same fundamental mechanism , but the equilibria between different confor - mational states may be set differently in different Hsp70s to tune them for different cellular roles . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Preparation of WT and Mutant Proteins and Disulﬁde - Linked Complexes Full - length bov taurus Hsc70 ( aa 1 – 650 ) , Hsc70 D C or two - domain Hsc70 ( aa 1 – 554 ) , NBD _ Linker ( aa 1 – 394 ) , and NBD ( aa 1 – 386 ) were expressed without fusion tags and puriﬁed as described ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) . Bov taurus auxilin J domain ( aa 810 – 910 ) was prepared as an N - terminal GST fusion protein and puriﬁed by glutathione afﬁnity chromatography ( Jiang et al . , 2003 ) . 15 N - labeled proteins were pre - pared by growth in minimal media supplemented with 15 N NH 4 Cl . To form disulﬁde - linked complexes , D876C GST - auxilin J domain was mixed with either R171C Hsc70 NBD or NBD _ Linker at J do - main : Hsc70 molar ratios of 1 : 5 in 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 50 % glycerol , 1 mM DTT , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , and 2 . 5 mM ATP and dialyzed overnight into 2 3 100 - fold excess of the same buffer without DTT . This led to near complete conversion of the J domain to disulﬁde - linked complex . The complex was puriﬁed by glutathione afﬁnity chro - matography using on - column thrombin digestion to remove the com - plex from the resin , followed by ion - exchange chromatography on Q - and SP - Sepharose . Complexes were concentrated to 40 mg / ml and stored in 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 50 % glycerol , and 1 mM oxidized glutathione . Crystallization and Structure Determination Complexes were screened for crystallization directly from storage buffer after being brought to 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , and 2 mM ATP or AMPPNP as described ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) . Crystals appeared in a variety of conditions , but the best grew as long prisms in 0 . 2 M ammonium acetate , 0 . 1M Tris ( pH 8 . 5 ) , 25 % PEG3350 ( for NBD : J domain ) , or 0 . 2 M calcium acetate , 20 % PEG3350 ( NBD _ Linker : J do - main ) .
