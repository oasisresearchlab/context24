REVIEW What constitutes B social complexity ^ and B social intelligence ^ in birds ? Lessons from ravens Palmyre H . Boucherie 1 & Matthias - Claudio Loretto 1 , 2 & Jorg J . M . Massen 1 & Thomas Bugnyar 1 , 2 Received : 9 March 2018 / Revised : 10 July 2018 / Accepted : 12 November 2018 / Published online : 19 January 2019 # The Author ( s ) 2019 Abstract In the last decades , the assumption that complex social life is cognitively challenging , and thus can drive mental evolution , has received much support from empirical studies in nonhuman primates . While extending the scope to other mammals and birds , different views have been adopted on what constitutes social complexity and which specific cognitive skills are selected for . Notably , many avian species form B open ^ groups as non - breeders ( i . e . , seasonally and before sexual maturity ) that have been largely ignored as potential sources of social complexity . Reviewing 30 years of research on ravens , we illustrate the socio - ecological conditions faced by these birds as non - breeders and discuss how these relate to their socio - cognitive skills . We argue that the non - breeding period is key to understand raven social life and , to a larger extent , avian social life in general . We furthermore emphasize how the combination of the large - scale perspective ( defining social system components : e . g . , social organization , mating system ) and the individual - scale perspective on social systems allows to better capture the complete set of social challenges experienced by individuals throughout their life , ultimately resulting on a more comprehensive understanding of species ’ social complexity .

Non - breeding period Introduction Proxies for social complexity and B social intelligence ^ While it is widely acknowledged that animal societies differ in social complexity , there has been little consensus about what is exactly meant by this term ( Freeberg et al . 2012 ; Bradbury and Vehrencamp 2014 ; Bergman and Beehner , 2015 ; Rubenstein et al . 2016 ; Kappeler 2019 , topical collection on Social complexity ) . In vertebrates , notably primates , social complexity has long been viewed through the prism of social cognition ( Jolly 1966 ; Whiten and Byrne 1988 ; Barrett et al . 2007 ; Byrne and Bates2007 ; but see in insects : Sheehan and Tibbetts 2008 ; Lihoreau et al . 2012 ) . The B social intelligence hypothesis ^ assumes that the challenges posed in coping with the variability and unpredictability of the social environment have been a major evolutionary force for the evolution of cognition ( Jolly 1966 ; Humphrey 1976 ; Byrne and Whiten 1988 ) . While all animals face daily challenges in their physi - cal environment , group - living animals additionally have to adapt their behavior and decisions to that of conspecifics ( Kummer et al . 1974 ; Whiten and Byrne 1988 ; Bergman et al . 2003 ) . Various proxies arose from the need to quantify and compare social complexity and B social intelligence ^ across species . In particular , the social brain hypothesis sug - gested that dealing with an increasing number of conspecifics might go along with a qualitative and quantitative improve - ment of information processing abilities and , possibly , larger brains ( Dunbar 1992 , 1998 ; but see González - Forero and Gardner 2018 ) . As a consequence , brain size ( neocortex ratio ) and group size were the first and most widely used measures Communicated by D .

So far , the social brain hypothesis has received strong sup - port in haplorrhines primates ( Dunbar 1992 ; but see DeCasien et al . 2017 ; Powell et al . 2017 ) . However , the relationship between sociality and brain size is less clear in other taxa ( Barton 1996 ; Shultz and Dunbar 2006 ; MacLean et al . 2009 ) , and particularly unclear in birds ( Beauchamp and Fernandez - Juricic 2004 ; Burish et al . 2004 ; Iwaniuk and Arnold 2004 ; Iwaniuk and Hurd 2005 ) . Part of the explana - tion for this probably lies in the inadequacy of both brain and group size as proxies of cognitive and social complexity ( Kappeler 2019 , in topical collection on Social complexity ) . Specifically , with regard to social complexity , it can be chal - lenging to identify the size of fundamental social units , es - pecially when species tend to form B open ^ groups , charac - terized by high degrees of fission - fusion dynamics ( Aureli et al . 2008 ) . In addition , group size does not allow to differ - entiate a flock of a hundred fish from a troop of a hundred baboons . In both cases , we may see complex motion pat - terns that can be explained by simple rules of attraction and repulsion ( Couzin et al . 2002 ; Sumpter 2006 ; Farine et al . 2017 ) ; yet , baboons live in multilevel societies characterized by the interweaving of multiple layers of social units , them - selves based on the formation of individualized relationships ( Kummer 1968 ) . Hence , compared to fish shoals , baboon troops are considered to be socially more complex and cog - nitively demanding . Social relationships Moving beyond group size , it was then suggested that not only the quantity of partners matters , but also the type and quality of the relationship that binds individuals ( Cords and Aureli 2000 ; Dunbar and Shultz 2007 ; Emery et al . 2007 ; Shultz and Dunbar 2007 , 2010 ) . Along this line , the number of differentiated rela - tionships that individuals have in a group has been proposed as a better proxy to quantify social complexity ( Freeberg et al . 2012 ; Bergman and Beehner 2015 ) . Using this definition , the number and diversity of partners which individuals regularly encounter and interact with , the nature of their interactions , as well as the context in which they occur , are at the core of social complexity ( Freeberg , 2012 ; Bergman and Beehner , 2015 ; Fischer et al . 2017 ) . Relationships are by definition inferred from the nature , frequency , and patterns of repeated interactions occurring among group members ( Hinde 1976 ) , while the group structure is inferred from the network of all relationships emerging in the group ( Hinde 1976 ) . The emergence and maintenance of rela - tionships requires at least individual recognition and the ability to keep track of social interactions ( Massen et al . 2010 ; Dunbar 2018a ) . Dealing with an increasing number of relationships thus implies an increase in information processing capacities and , possibly , larger brains ( Dunbar 1992 , 1998 ) . In addition , indi - viduals may profit from inferring relationships between others , which may also go along with a qualitative improvement of processing abilities ( Whiten and Byrne 1988 ; Bergman et al . 2003 ; Bond et al . 2003 ; Call and Tomasello 2008 ) . Social system components Several intrinsic group constraints can mediate the nature and patterning of social interactions , and thus ultimately , the de - gree of social complexity of the systems ( Krause and Ruxton 2002 ; Lehmann et al . 2016 ; Dunbar 2018b ; Kappeler 2019 , topical collection on Social complexity ) . Each social system results from the combination of its social organization , mating and care system , and its social structure , and each change in one component is likely to affect the others ( Kappeler and van Schaik 2002 ) . Furthermore , social systems are not static ; in - stead , they can be remarkably flexible ( Lott 1991 ; Henzi et al . 2009 ; Streatfeild et al . 2011 ; Schradin 2013 ) . Within the same species , populations can exhibit different social systems ac - cording to the combination of external ( e . g . , ecological ) and internal pressures ( e . g . competition for food or reproduction ) they experience ( e . g . , Baglione et al . 2002a , b ; Schradin et al . 2010 ) . Substantial intraspecific variations in social organiza - tion ( i . e . , group size and composition ) can also be observed in various species according to seasons , breeding activity , and changes in ecological factors ( e . g . , food availability , predation risk ) . In birds , the pair and by extension the family unit is often the fundamental social - unit of most systems ( i . e . , reproductive partners and yearly juveniles , except for colonial or coopera - tive breeders ) . While this is true during the breeding season , birds often join larger flocks for foraging or roosting outside the breeding season , or when food resources are scarce ( Develey and Peres 2000 ; South and Pruett - Jones 2000 ; Amano et al . 2006 ; de Moura et al . 2010 ; see also Silk et al . 2014 ) . It is essential to consider such intraspecific variations in social systems if we want to characterize adequately their de - gree of social complexity , in particular in birds ( see also Ashton et al . 2018 ) . Taking an individual perspective on social systems : The effect of age and life history stages on individual sociality Even though characterizing the different components of a sys - tem ( i . e . , organization , mating and care system , structure ) pro - vides a valuable framework to evaluate its potential complex - ity as a whole , it is not necessarily an accurate representation of what individuals experience on the day - to - day basis ( Aureli and Schino 2019 , topical collection on Social complexity ) . Over a lifetime , we can expect substantial variation in the social environments individuals are exposed to , notably in species with a long life span . Individuals ’ life histories are 12 Page 2 of 14 Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 2019 ) 73 : 12 paced by major events such as sexual maturity or the first breeding attempt , that are also likely to affect the set of part - ners they might seek to associate with . In numerous bird spe - cies , non - breeder individuals — immature juveniles and ‘ floaters ’ ( i . e . , sexually mature individuals that are not repro - ducing ) — tend to flock together ( e . g . , Henderson and Hart 1991 ; Braun et al . 2012 ) , which likely maximizes their sur - vival before / outside of breeding ( Powell 1974 ; Wright et al . 2003 ) . In long - term monogamous species like corvids , juve - niles tend to affiliate with multiple partners , of both same and / or opposite sex , and often preferentially with siblings ; over time , they interact more and more exclusively with a single opposite sex partner , eventually resulting in a pair bond ( de Kort et al . 2006 ; von Bayern et al . 2007 ; Scheid et al . 2008 ; Loretto et al . 2012 ) . A characteristic feature of the non - breeding period in birds is the high variability and unpredictability of the social envi - ronment , typically going along with dispersal and frequent joining / leaving of group members ( i . e . , high degree of fission - fusion dynamic ; Silk et al . 2014 ) . Thus , this period seems to reflect an increased diversity in social opportunities and challenges , which supports the argument that the com - plexity of avian social systems cannot be captured from the sole perspective of adults ’— breeders — social system . However , to date , we have relatively few data on the diversity and dynamics of social relationships that may emerge outside of the family unit in avian species , and in particular outside of the breeding context ( i . e . , before the first reproductive attempt and outside of the breeding season ) . Towards a combined approach of ( avian ) social complexity In the subsequent sections , we will use the common raven ( Corvus corax ) as an example to illustrate how a combination of top - down and bottom - up approaches ( i . e . , characterization of social systems ’ components ; individual perspective on so - cial challenges ) may allow us to capture the diversity of social environments experienced by individuals across a lifetime , and thus better apprehend the species ’ social complexity . By reviewing the research of the last 30 years ( which started in the late 1980s with the seminal work of Bernd Heinrich and got momentum in the last 10 years by studies from our own group ) , we will outline ( i ) which socio - ecological conditions ravens face as non - breeders , and ( ii ) how this relates to their social behavior and socio - cognitive skills . Raven social life Common ravens are long - term monogamous and breeding pairs defend a territory of approximately 10 km 2 year - round ( Haffer and Kirchner 1993 ; Rösner and Selva 2005 ) . According to their breeding system , ravens ’ social life could thus be characterized as B moderately complex ^ ( Boarman and Heinrich 1999 ) , as the quality and preva - lence of the pair bond may constrain the formation of social relationships with other conspecifics . Breeding is a life stage which ravens reach earliest at an age of 3 – 4 years ( Ratcliffe 1997 ; Webb et al . 2009 ) , but it can also take up to 10 years and more ( unpublished data from our field site ) . With a life expectancy in the wild of 10 – 15 years ( occasionally also 20 – 30 years ; Haffer and Kirchner 1993 ; Fransson et al . 2010 ) , ravens do spend a significant part of their life in the non - breeder state ( Fig . 1 ) . Characterizing the social complexity solely based on their breeding system may thus be misleading . Non - breeding ravens tend to form temporary flocks that are composed of juvenile , immature birds but also of adults that do not have a partner and / or a breeding territory ( Heinrich 1989 ; Braun and Bugnyar 2012 ; Loretto et al . 2016b ) . Flocks vary in size : they are largest for roosting ( up to > 1000 birds ; Engel et al . 1992 ; Wright et al . 2003 ) , likely because of predator protection , and relatively small for socializing ( < 10 birds ; Braun and Bugnyar 2012 ) . During foraging , ravens can aggregate in large numbers at food bonanzas like carcasses of large mammals or garbage dumps ( > 100 birds ; Boarman and Heinrich 1999 ) , but mostly they forage in smaller groups ( < 30 birds ; Heinrich 1989 ; Dall and Wright 2009 ) , using night roosts as information centers ( Marzluff et al . 1996 ; Wright et al . 2003 ) and recruiting others via food - associated calls ( Heinrich 1988 ) . Being in a group in - creases the individuals ’ chances of gaining access to food that is monopolized by territorial breeders or defended by predators ( Marzluff and Heinrich 1991 ; Stahler et al . 2002 ) ; however , it also results in high food competition among non - breeders , expressed in physical aggression , kleptoparasitism , and the pilfering of food caches ( Marzluff and Heinrich 1991 ; Heinrich and Pepper 1998 ; Bugnyar and Kotrschal 2002 ) . Taken together , non - breeding ravens ’ social life can be characterized as flexible with regard to group size and com - position and as a mix of cooperation and competition concerning the social opportunities and challenges faced ( Fig . 1 ) . Hence , this life stage features ( i ) a degree of social complexity , which is not represented by the breeding system , and ( ii ) some of the key factors discussed for the evolution of social cognition ( e . g . , competition ; Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis : Byrne and Whiten 1988 ; and cooperation ; Vygotskian intelligence hypothesis : Moll and Tomasello 2007 ) . However , a minimalistic alternative view would be that raven groups represent anonymous crowds with individuals interacting on the basis of simple decision rules . The critical question is thus whether or not individual identities and their social relationships matter in those groups ? Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 2019 ) 73 : 12 Page 3 of 14 12 Study population and group dynamics Since 2007 , our working group has been monitoring the pop - ulation of wild ravens in the valley Almtal in the Northern Austrian Alps . On average , 50 ravens aggregate every day at a zoo , the Cumberland Wildpark Grünau ( 15 ravens in sum - mer and up to 120 in winter ; 47 . 80° N , 13 . 95° E ) , to scrounge food from captive animals such as wild boars ( Sus scrofa ) , bears ( Ursus arctos ) , and wolves ( Canis lupus ; Drack and Kotrschal 1995 ) . Since the beginning of our long - term study , more than 300 ravens have been trapped and individually marked . During this procedure , we collect blood samples for the genetic analysis of sex and kinship and estimate the ra - vens ’ age classes based on mouth and feather coloration ( Heinrich 1994 ; Heinrich and Marzluff 1992 ) . Presence - absence data and behavioral observations on these marked birds reveal that the groups in the park consist mainly of non - breeders ( > 90 % ) . The sex ratio of the non - breeders is even and the age classes are distributed in about 20 % juveniles ( ravens in their first year ) , 60 % sub adults ( between 1 and 3 years of age ) , and 20 % adults ( older than 3 years ) . In addition to the non - breeders , 7 – 12 breeding pairs of surround - ing territories use the park opportunistically , i . e . , during winter when food is scarce or during the period of raising their off - spring ( Loretto et al . 2017 ) . Contrary to breeders , non - breeders do not defend a territory and they can be highly vagrant ( Heinrich et al . 1994 ) . Using GPS tracking , we recently found a remarkable individual var - iation concerning the degree of vagrancy : some birds roam over thousands of square kilometers ( km 2 ) , visiting many dif - ferent food sources ; others move between several food sources covering around 100 km 2 ; and again , others rely on a single food source and can be found in an area of only a few km 2 over months to years ( Loretto et al . 2016a , 2017 ) . These re - sults match our long - term observations in the zoo , where we categorized non - breeders according to their presence / absence pattern as B rare visitors ^ ( highly vagrant birds ) , B regular visitors ^ ( birds using the food source in the study area from time to time ) , and B locals ^ ( individuals that are observed almost daily in the park ; Braun and Bugnyar 2012 ) . In general , the food sources used by ravens in the Eastern Alps are typically of anthropogenic origin ( e . g . , Fig . 1 Schematic representation of the variations in the set of stage - specific social partners , across ravens ’ three fundamental life stages ( i . e . , family stage , non - breeder stage , territorial stage ) . Note that in case of divorce or death of the reproductive partner , individuals return to the non - breeder stage . All stage - specific partners are listed below the figure . The bird in orange represents a theoretical focal individual going through all three life stages . Figure and drawings by Palmyre H . Boucherie 12 Page 4 of 14 Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 2019 ) 73 : 12 game parks , compost stations , and garbage dumps ) , cor - roborating the findings of other studies in Western Europe ( Huber 1991 ; Wright et al . 2003 ; Loretto et al . 2016a ) as well as in rural parts of North America ( e . g . , Boarman et al . 2006 ; Webb et al . 2012 ) . Most of these anthropo - genic food sources are highly predictable , B refilled ^ on a regular basis and used by many ravens at a time ( often 30 – 50 individuals per day ) . Birds that are feeding at the same site usually aggregate at dusk at one or few night roosts in the surrounding of that site . Those birds that stay at a particular site across months ( B locals ^ ) have a very high probability of repeatedly meeting other ravens with similar presence patterns ( locals meet locals on around 70 % of the days ) and a moderately high likelihood of meeting ravens that pass by at that site from time to time ( the same B visitors ^ on around 40 % of the days ; Loretto et al . 2017 ) . Moreover , GPS tracking revealed that even when ravens range over thousands of square kilometers ; they can still be found in repeated associations with the same individuals at different foraging sites , located more than 100 km away from each other ( Loretto et al . 2017 ) . The differentiated use of foraging sites leads to a high degree of fission - fusion dynamics operating on different spatio - temporal scales . First , per site and day , non - breeder groups split up into small units when departing from the night roost in the morning ; they may form bigger units dur - ing foraging and smaller units during socializing and even - tually gather at the same night roost in the evening again ( Braun et al . 2012 ; Loretto et al . 2017 ) . Second , across days , birds may stay at the site or move to another food source at another site and join the local non - breeder group there ( Loretto et al . 2017 ) . Similar spatio - temporal patterns have been documented in other studies on non - breeding ravens ( Heinrich 1988 , 1989 ; Dall and Wright2009 ) and linked to their scavenging life style : i . e . , when they exploit a tempo - rary food source like a carcass , ravens show the daily pattern described above ; upon depletion of the source , individuals seem to independently leave and join other groups ( Heinrich et al . 1994 ) . Our findings add two important points to this picture : ( i ) size and composition of non - breeder groups may change independently of the availabil - ity of food , i . e . , some individuals come and go although the food supply is constant and ( ii ) non - breeder groups may develop structure , i . e . , some individuals prefer to stay at a site and thus become B locals ^ that meet each other on a daily basis ( Braun and Bugnyar 2012 ; Loretto et al . 2017 ) . Which factors determine individuals ’ degree of vagrancy is still unknown . What can be said , however , is that a B local ^ life style creates conditions that meet several criteria of promot - ing individualized relationships and socio - cognitive skills , i . e . , meeting repeatedly , competing for the same resources ( access to food , partners , territories ) , and competing for sta - tus ( formation of dominance rank hierarchies ) . Raven social relationships and socio - cognitive skills Ravens are renowned for using social information to find and exploit ephemeral food sources ( Heinrich 1989 , 2011 ) . They can passively share information at their night roosts or actively recruit others to foraging sites ( Marzluff et al . 1996 ) . Specifically , when ravens face difficulties in accessing food , they may give food - associated calls ( i . e . , B yells ^ or B haa ^ calls ) that attract nearby ravens ( Heinrich and Marzluff 1991 ) and meet the criteria of functional reference ( Heinrich and Marzluff 1991 ; Bugnyar et al . 2001 ) . Given the dynamics of raven groups ( see above ) , one could argue that food calls attract any raven close by , and consequently , lead to the formation of anonymous crowds ( Heinrich 1989 ) . However , recent studies found large inter - individual variation in terms of : ( i ) how ravens sound ( Boeckle et al . 2012 ) , ( ii ) how often they call ( Sierro 2015 ) , and ( iii ) whom they respond to ( Szipl et al . 2015 ) . Parts of the differences in call structure and call rate can be explained by the birds ’ age and sex , with adults having a B clearer ^ and B deeper ^ voices as compared to immature birds ( Boeckle et al . 2018 ) , immatures calling more often than adults ( Sierro 2015 ) , and adult females calling more often than adult males ( Szipl et al . 2015 ) . Still , individual - specific calling features remain a prominent factor in the analyses ( c . f . , Enggist - Dueblin and Pfister 2002 ) , and can be picked up by listeners in playback experiments : i . e . , in a habituation / dishabituation design , ravens discriminate unfamiliar birds , matched for age and sex , solely on the basis of their call structure ( Boeckle et al . 2012 ) . Moreover , when ravens could choose between two callers in a paired playback design , they were more attracted to the food calls of adult females than adult males , but only when these individuals were from the local community , i . e . , the birds hardly approached the loud - speaker when food calls of unfamiliar individuals were played back ( Szipl et al . 2015 ) . These findings provide the first evi - dence that wild ravens take into account the familiarity of other non - breeders and treat local individuals differently from vagrants . Finally , recent observations showed that ravens were more likely to call when a social partner was in the vicinity but not yet at the foraging site and ceased calling as soon as the partner arrived ( Sierro 2015 ) . This raises the possibility that ravens may intend to recruit specific individuals , i . e . , potential allies in the competition for food . Competition for high - quality food such as carrion can be severe and often takes the form of aggression ( Heinrich 1989 ) . The chances of winning a conflict depends heavily on a raven ’ s age class ( adults > immatures ) and sex ( males > fe - males ) , but also on its bonding status and the quality of its social relationships , respectively : i . e . , birds never engaging in affiliative interactions lose most fights , birds with increasingly strong relationships win increasingly more fights , and pair - bonded territorial birds win most fights ( Gwinner 1964 ; Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 2019 ) 73 : 12 Page 5 of 14 12 Huber 1991 ) . Note that these patterns emerge mainly as a result of passive social support ( i . e . , presence of an affiliate ; Braun and Bugnyar 2012 ) . Nevertheless , ravens may also get actively involved in others ’ conflicts ( Gwinner 1964 ) , whereby they tend to support the aggressor ( Loretto et al . 2012 ) . However , if the victim is a close affiliate , they likely intervene on its behalf , even when the aggressor is higher in rank than them - selves ( Fraser and Bugnyar 2012 ) . When being attacked , vic - tims may utter defensive calls that function to appease the ag - gressor , but also alert the audience ( Szipl et al . 2017 ) . In a recent field study , victims were found to adjust their signaling to the audience composition : they increased calling when a close af - filiate was in the audience but decreased calling when a close affiliate of the aggressor was in the audience ( Szipl et al . 2017 ) . Taken together , these studies provide strong support for the assumption that raven non - breeder groups are more than anonymous crowds : i . e . , individuals form differentiated rela - tionships that are expressed in dominance and affiliation pat - terns . These studies also show that affiliative relationships are not restricted to future reproductive partners , as individuals form bonds with different partners ( kin and non - kin ) and often maintain more than one bond at a time ( Braun and Bugnyar 2012 ) . Still , raven affiliation networks remain relatively small in both captive and wild settings , hardly comprising more than two – five affiliates at a time ( in the wild : Braun and Bugnyar 2012 ; in captivity : Kulahci et al . 2016 ) . The quality of raven relationships moreover can be described by the components value , compatibility , and security ( Fraser and Bugnyar 2010a ) , much in the same way as discussed for primate bonds ( Fraser et al . 2008a ) . Specifically , the component value relates to the benefits associated with the relationship ( e . g . , allo - grooming , support in conflicts ) , compatibility to the extent of tolerance among partners , and security to the predictability of partners ’ interactions and the relationship stability over time ( Fraser et al . 2008a ) . Affiliates also show primate - like forms of post - conflict management such as reconciliation ( Fraser and Bugnyar 2011 ) and bystander consolation to vic - tims of aggression ( Fraser and Bugnyar 2010b ) , indicating the importance of relationship repair and maintenance mecha - nisms ( cf . Aureli and de Waal 2000 ) . Social knowledge Based on the importance of social relationships found in ob - servational studies , we experimentally addressed the selective use of social relationships , and possible underlying mecha - nisms , in a series of cooperation studies with birds of our captive groups . As expected , ravens preferred to cooperate with their affiliates as compared to non - affiliates in experi - ments using the loose string paradigm ( i . e . , where two indi - viduals have to simultaneously pull on two ends of a string to move a platform with a food reward inside reach ; Asakawa - Haas et al . 2016 ) . Success in this set - up was highly dependent on the tolerance for proximity between the cooperation part - ners , but also on the partners ’ behavior in the previous trial , and ravens stopped cooperating when they had been cheated by their partner in respect to the reward distribution ( i . e . , the other got more than they themselves ; Massen et al . 2015b ) . In studies using the exchange paradigm ( i . e . , where an initial item is traded with a human experimenter for a better one ) , ravens stopped cooperating after witnessing another ra - ven being rewarded for the same action with food of better quality or being rewarded for doing nothing ( Wascher and Bugnyar 2013 ) , indicating that they were sensitive to inequity in reward distribution and working effort . In a similar setting , ravens remembered fairly and unfairly behaving human ex - perimenters in reciprocal interactions and avoided the unfair experimenter for at least 1 month after the initial cheat ( Müller et al . 2017 ) . Recent findings from Kabadayi and Osvath ( 2017 ) suggest that ravens might even be capable of future planning with regard to such bartering . Finally , we used playback experiments to specifically test for the ravens ’ knowledge about social relationships . Adult ravens that had left their captive group years ago instantly responded to hearing territory calls ( B rab ^ ) of former group members as compared to the same calls of unfamiliar birds ( matched for age and sex ; Boeckle and Bugnyar 2012 ) . Among familiar callers , they even discriminated former affil - iates from non - affiliates . These results clearly show that ra - vens are capable of remembering conspecifics on the basis of familiarity but also on their personal relationship valance ( Boeckle and Bugnyar 2012 ) . Some of our field observations suggested that ravens may not only represent their own relationships ( i . e . , they can keep track with whom they affiliate or not , and to a certain extent , recall the history of past interactions with their different part - ners ) , but also take into account the relationships of others , so called third - party understanding . Inspired by the seminal work of Cheney and colleagues ( Cheney et al . 1995 ; Bergman et al . 2003 ) , we tested ravens ’ third - party understanding in a play - back experiment by simulating social interactions between group members of our captive groups ( Massen et al . 2014a ) . Note that at the time of the study , we kept two groups of non - breeders in visual and auditory contact , allowing us to test birds about their knowledge of relationships between their group members and those of their neighbors . We played back domi - nance interactions that were either congruent with the existing dominance hierarchy ( i . e . , a dominant bird displacing a subor - dinate bird ) , or incongruent with the dominance hierarchy ( i . e . , a subordinate bird displacing a dominant bird ) , with the latter mimicking a dominance reversal . The tested ravens showed clear behavioral differences between these two conditions , confirming that in the incongruent condition the birds ’ expec - tancy was violated . The fact that they also did so with the playback of the neighboring group suggests that they mentally 12 Page 6 of 14 Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 2019 ) 73 : 12 represent the relationships of others , as in the case of those neighboring birds they could not use themselves as a reference point to infer the relationship of others ( Massen et al . 2014a ) . B Politics ^ : Manipulating others ’ relationships Ravens , like many other animals ( Massen et al . 2010 ) , estab - lish and maintain their relationships by seeking each other ’ s close proximity and preening each other ( Fraser and Bugnyar 2010a ) . Occasionally a third raven intervenes in such affiliative behavior , making the others stop affiliating ( Gwinner 1964 ) . Observations at our field site suggest that these interventions are not random . Ravens that already have strong affiliative relationships specifically target those that are in the process of establishing such a relationship ( Massen et al . 2014b ) . By doing so , they might prevent these birds from strengthening their relationship , and potentially , from rising in rank ( Massen et al . 2014b ) . Note that ravens do not just intervene in any birds ’ affiliative interactions , as they ignore the affiliative interactions of birds that have not yet established a relationship . They thus seem to monitor others ’ interactions and take into account whether individuals exchange favors repeatedly and reciprocally ( compare Hinde 1976 ) . These ob - servations raise the intriguing possibility that ravens not only represent others ’ relationships but try to manipulate the for - mation of bonds , and consequently prevent future alliances ( Massen et al . 2014b ) . Discussion By reviewing more than 30 years of research , we reveal a differentiated picture of raven social life : ( i ) free - ranging non - breeding ravens may meet regularly , ( ii ) form social rela - tionships , ( iii ) show a variety of behavioral maneuvers in com - petition for food and status , and ( iv ) rely on social knowledge for social - decision making . Playback experiments conducted on captive birds corroborate that : ( v ) ravens are sensitive to individual information in vocal communication and ( vi ) are capable of mentally representing their own and others ’ relationships . Ravens ’ social structure in comparison to other birds Our findings clearly indicate that raven non - breeder groups can be more than B anonymous crowds , ^ which matches the observations of other bird species . Closely related corvids like rooks , Corvus frugilegus , and jackdaws , Corvus monedula , also form their first social bonds early in life , typically in the non - breeder state ( von Bayern et al . 2007 ; Scheid et al . 2008 ) , and adults may seek / keep social relationships in addition to their reproductive partner ( in rooks : Boucherie et al . 2016 , 2018 ) , even though they differ in breeding style ( ravens : ter - ritorial ; jackdaws : semi - colonial ; rooks : colonial ) . Taking a broader phylogenetical perspective , flocks of geese are struc - tured by family units that actively support each other , and clans of related individuals that rest close to each other ( Lorenz 1935 , 1988 ; Lamprecht1986 ; Scheiber et al . 2013 ) . Foraging flocks of many parrots are characterized by overlap - ping home ranges , frequent exchange of flock members through fission - fusion events and reliance on social learning to accumulate foraging lore ( Bradbury and Balsby 2016 ) , re - sembling the foraging dynamics and movement patterns found in ravens . Members of parrot flocks may also show multiple individualized relationships , i . e . , reproductive pairs and affiliative relationships among non - reproductive partners ( e . g . , Spoon et al . 2004 ; Hobson et al . 2014 ) . Moreover , par - rots show communicative interactions like short - term call matching to address specific group members ( Wanker et al . 2005 ; Balsby et al . 2012 ) or vocal exchange to B negotiate ^ spacing ( Bradbury and Balsby 2016 ) . Taken together , this confirms that monogamy does not pre - vent species from developing B complex ^ social structures , in and / or out breeding , i . e . , with individuals relying on social information to make decisions and on the formation of indi - vidualized relationships to navigate their social environment . Hence , it shows that birds from different taxonomic groups rely on individualized relationships aside of their reproductive partnership and despite of a variability in group dynamics . In several species mentioned above ( i . e . , corvids , geese , parrots ) , individuals are long - lived , and thus face a prolonged non - breeder period before the first reproduc - tive attempts . This is not the case in all bird species . Although all bird species face such a transition period to adulthood and sexual maturity , we can expect its preva - lence and duration to vary widely according to the spe - cies ’ social system , life history traits ( e . g . , lifespan , age at first breeding attempt ) and the patterns of natal dispersal ( e . g . , sex - bias , dispersal distances , and extent to which dispersal is constrained by ecological factors ; Greenwood and Harvey 1982 ; Mulder 1995 ; Verhulst et al . 1997 ) . Yet , the non - breeder state may also refer to a phase faced regularly throughout an adult bird ’ s life , i . e . , the non - reproductive phase in a breeding cycle . Apart from ecological factors like seasonality in tempera - ture and / or food availability , numerous species exhibit changes in social structure between breeding and non - breeding seasons . Taking corvid species as an example , irrespective of their mating and care systems ( territorial , colonial , cooperatively breeding ) , the formation of B open ^ groups for foraging and roosting outside breeding seems to be the rule rather than the exception ( Rowley 1973 ; Clayton and Emery 2007 ; Marzluff and Angell 2007 ; see also Holzhaider et al . 2011 ; St Clair et al . 2015 ) . Seasonal variation in social dynamics and flocking Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 2019 ) 73 : 12 Page 7 of 14 12 behavior can also be observed in small bird species with a quick development and transition to breeding state , re - spectively ( e . g . , many songbirds defend territories in summer and flock in winter , Aplin et al . 2012 ; Silk et al . 2014 ) . A common feature of non - breeder aggregations across spe - cies and taxonomic groups seems to be a high variability in group dynamic and membership ( Silk et al . 2014 ) . In species forming individualized social relationships — like ravens — dealing with such an unpredictable social environment is as - sumed to be cognitively challenging , as individuals need to keep track of relationships in the absence of group members , infer relationships formed in their own absence , and possibly manage their social environment by selectively joining others ( Aureli et al . 2008 ; see also Jolly 1966 ; Humphrey 1976 for the social intelligence hypothesis ) . Hence , we argue that the non - breeding period is key to fully understand social com - plexity and cognition in most avian species . Variation in the social environment and effect on social skills A promising approach for an integrative view of avian social complexity may be to consider the types of challenges faced by birds in both the breeder and the non - breeder stage . Depending on the stage , individuals may face predominantly opposing or shared goals with other group members , which require different types of socio - cognitive skills . For instance , when young ravens join non - breeder groups , they are confronted with fierce competition for obtaining access and information about limited resources ( Marzluff and Heinrich 1991 ; Bugnyar and Kotrschal 2002 ) . In such a situation , it is highly advantageous to have B allies ^ in conflicts and the most reliable allies are affiliates ( i . e . , bonding partners ; Silk 1982 ; Connor et al . 1992 ; Schino et al . 2007 ; Fraser and Bugnyar 2012 ) . Hence , life in non - breeder groups should select for B Machiavellian ^ skills ( Byrne and Whiten 1988 ) , i . e . , social knowledge and its tactical use ( Heinrich 2011 ; Bugnyar and Massen 2017 ) . In contrast , when older ravens eventually settle for breed - ing as monogamous pairs , they face a highly cooperative sit - uation , with reproductive partners sharing goals in respect to raising young , fending off predators and intruders ( Lorenz 1937 ; Heinrich 1989 ) . Such a situation may select for B cooperative ^ / Vygotkian skills ( Moll and Tomasello 2007 ) like high levels of tolerance and coordination ( Massen et al . 2015b ) , and possibly other - regard and empathy ( Horn et al . 2016 ; but see Massen et al . 2015a ; Lambert et al . 2017 ) . Still , reproductive pairs may join non - breeders outside of breeding season , where they could rely on their Machiavellian skills again ( e . g . , to maximize their benefits in term of access to food ) . We thus likely find a mix of factors constituting social challenges , with some factors being more important than others at different life stages and / or seasons . Note that the relative importance of each factor / challenge may be different from species to species . Birds that exploit temporarily abun - dant food sources such as fruiting trees , as for example Pinyon jays ( Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus ) , face little contest compe - tition during foraging . Rather than outcompeting each other , they might benefit from collective behavior and instead of Machiavellian skills show highly coordinated behaviors among group members ( Marzluff and Balda 1992 ; Bednekoff and Balda 1996 ; Duque et al . 2018 ) . Ravens ’ social cognition in comparison to other species Our recent findings on ravens ’ social knowledge fit well to those of B socially complex ^ mammals : dyadic and third - party knowledge has been experimentally demonstrated in nonhu - man primates ( Cheney and Seyfarth 1990 , 2008 ; Silk 1999 ) and hyenas ( Engh et al . 2005 ; Holekamp et al . 2007 ; see also in dolphins , Connor 2007 ; and in sea lions , Kastak and Schusterman 2002 ) . Long - term memory for partners and re - lationships has been demonstrated in a variety of taxa , i . e . , elephants ( McComb et al . 2000 , 2001 ) , ungulates ( Kendrick et al . 2001 ; Briefer et al . 2012 ) , cetaceans ( Bruck 2013 ) , bats ( Kerth et al . 2011 ) , and carnivores ( Pitcher et al . 2010 ) . Moreover , how ravens use their social knowledge reflects many of the socio - cognitive maneuver reported for other an - imals , notably nonhuman primates . For instance , chimpan - zees , Pan troglodytes , also alter their signaling depending on the audience : they exaggerate their screams in case the rank of one member of this audience at least , matches or surpasses the aggressor ’ s rank ( Slocombe and Zuberbühler 2007 ) . Chimpanzees also selectively choose cooperation partners in experimental settings ( Melis et al . 2006 ) , actively console their affiliates after a conflict ( de Waal and van Roosmalen 1979 ; Fraser et al . 2008b ) , and intervene in others ’ affiliative interactions , possibly to prevent them from forming bonds ( de Waal 1982 ; see also Mielke et al . 2017 ) . Selectivity in cooperation has also been demon - strated in monkeys ( e . g . , in Barabary macaques , Molesti and Majolo 2016 ; in capuchin monkey , de Waal and Davis 2003 ) , other corvids ( e . g . , in rooks , Seed et al . 2008 ; Scheid and Noë 2010 ) , elephants ( Plotnik et al . 2011 ) , wolves ( Marshall - Pescini et al . 2017 ) , and parrots ( Schwing et al . 2016 ) . Post - conflict consolation have been described for some primates ( review in Fraser et al . 2009 ; see also Palagi et al . 2004 ; Cordoni et al . 2006 ) , canids ( Palagi and Cordoni 2009 ) , and other corvids ( Seed et al . 2007 ; Logan et al . 2013 ) and B political ^ interventions in others ’ affiliation and agonistic interactions have been re - ported from a few species such as wolves , primates , and horses ( Ward et al . 2009 ; Krueger et al . 2015 ; Mielke et al . 2017 ) . 12 Page 8 of 14 Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 2019 ) 73 : 12 Hence , problems associated with dealing with social relationships are apparently solved in a similar way across distantly related species . What is yet unclear is whether the behavioral similarities between different taxa are also based on the same cognitive mechanisms . The recent findings in ravens hint towards similarities on the behavioral and cognitive level , supporting the idea of convergent evolution of socio - cognitive skills between birds and mammals ( Clayton and Emery 2004 ) , despite radical different brain structures ( Güntürkün and Bugnyar 2016 ) and , importantly , despite different social systems . Conclusion As in mammals , a substantial part of avian social complexity lies in the variability and unpredictability of the social envi - ronment in which birds navigate ( e . g . , formation of open groups characterized by high degrees of fission - fusion dynam - ics ) . Furthermore , we now have good evidences that a monog - amous mating system does not prevent avian societies from becoming B complex ^ and cognitively challenging in terms of social relationships . On the contrary , the monogamous mating system of many bird species makes them prone to use bonding partners as allies in conflicts and for gaining status . In addi - tion , such affiliative relationships may go beyond reproduc - tive partners and extend to kin and B friends ^ in the non - breeding period , in which individuals also experience high dynamics in group formation ( see Fig . 1 ) . Taking an individ - ual ’ s perspective on the challenges faced in different social settings within a species may be a promising approach to investigate ‘ social complexity ’ of birds , as it allows an inte - grative view across life history stages and social contexts . Ultimately , the combination of this individual level perspec - tive with the large - scale perspective on social systems should allow us to better apprehend the diversity of evolutionary routes that might have led to sociality and social complexity across species and taxa .
