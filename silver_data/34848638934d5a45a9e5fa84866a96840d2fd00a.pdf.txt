Cummings Sloan School of Management , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 50 Memorial Drive , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02142 , cummings @ mit . edu E ffective work groups engage in external knowledge sharing—the exchange of information , know - how , and feedback with customers , organizational experts , and others outside of the group . This paper argues that the value of external knowledge sharing increases when work groups are more structurally diverse . A struc - turally diverse work group is one in which the members , by virtue of their different organizational afﬁliations , roles , or positions , can expose the group to unique sources of knowledge . It is hypothesized that if members of structurally diverse work groups engage in external knowledge sharing , their performance will improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through unique external sources . A ﬁeld study of 182 work groups in a Fortune 500 telecommunications ﬁrm operationalizes structural diversity as member differences in geographic locations , functional assignments , reporting managers , and business units , as indicated by corporate database records . External knowledge sharing was measured with group member surveys and performance was assessed using senior executive ratings . Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing was more strongly associated with performance when work groups were more structurally diverse . Implications for theory and practice around the integration of work groups and social networks are addressed .

For these groups to be effective , structures and processes must be in place to foster members working together ( Cohen and Bailey 1997 , McGrath 1984 ) . Numerous studies have demonstrated beneﬁts for work groups that engage in information exchange and task - related communication within the group ( Allen 1977 , Tushman 1979 ) . Though successful work groups take advantage of the perspectives , talents , and ideas of different members , a well - designed group also creates a common understanding of the organizational context through sharing knowledge externally about the work ( Hackman 1987 ) . Previous research has shown that knowledge sharing outside of the group is positively related to performance ( Ancona and Caldwell 1992a , Brown and Utterback 1985 ) . It is increasingly clear that knowledge transfer , both within and outside of groups , plays a fundamen - tal role in the effectiveness of organizations ( Argote et al . 2000 , 2003 ) . The knowledge necessary for high performance in work groups can be tacit ( Polanyi 1966 ) , codiﬁed ( Zander and Kogut 1995 ) , or embodied in routines ( Nelson and Winter 1982 ) . Knowledge sharing is deﬁned here as the provision or receipt of task information , know - how , and feedback regarding a product or procedure ( Hansen 1999 ) . Along with verbal communication about the task and the exchange of tangible artifacts , knowledge sharing includes the implicit coordination of expertise ( Faraj and Sproull 2000 ) and information about who knows what in the group ( Rulke and Galaskiewicz 2000 ) . Knowledge sharing in work groups might entail pro - viding task information to a client or receiving feed - back on a project from senior managers . The sources of knowledge for any given work group can range from customers to organizational experts to members themselves ( von Hippel 1988 ) . Moreover , because task - related knowledge from a customer and an organizational expert are likely to be nonoverlapping , group members can elicit new ideas and insights from different sources of knowledge ( Ancona and Caldwell 1992b , Hansen 1999 ) . Social network theories support the notion that unique knowledge sources can be more valuable than knowledge sources shared by everyone ( Burt 1992 , Granovetter 1973 ) . However , theory and research have yet to address which types of diversity inﬂuence the value of knowledge sharing in work groups . 352 Cummings : Work Groups , Structural Diversity , and Knowledge Sharing Management Science 50 ( 3 ) , pp . 352 – 364 , ©2004 INFORMS 353 Structural Diversity vs . Demographic Diversity Scholars examining diversity in work groups have primarily focused on the consequences of demographic diversity ( e . g . , member differences in sex , age , or tenure ) for processes such as communication , conﬂict , or social integration ( Jehn et al . 1999 , Pelled et al . 1999 , O’Reilly et al . 1989 ) . The consistently negative effects of demographic diversity on group processes are likely the result of heightened member empha - sis on social categories rather than project - relevant information ( for a review , see Williams and O’Reilly 1998 ) . Demographic diversity should not increase the value of intragroup knowledge sharing or external knowledge sharing unless it exposes members to unique sources of knowledge related to the work . Relatively little attention has been given to member differences in organizational afﬁliations , roles , or posi - tions . With the rise in labor costs , global expansion , and corporate mergers , work groups are often used as a means for connecting members who are dispersed across different geographic locations , who represent different functions , who report to different managers , or who work in different business units ( DeSanctis and Monge 1999 , Jarvenpaa and Leidner 1999 , Maznevski and Chudoba 2000 ) . This variation in fea - tures of the group structure is introduced here as structural diversity because of its potential to expose members to different sources of task information , know - how , and feedback . Four types of structural diversity in work groups are discussed in more detail below : geographic locations ( e . g . , Van den Bulte and Moenaert 1998 ) , functional assignments ( e . g . , Bunderson and Sutcliffe 2002 ) , reporting man - agers ( e . g . , Burns 1989 ) , and business units ( e . g . , Hansen 2002 ) . Furthermore , external knowledge shar - ing should be more valuable than intragroup knowl - edge sharing for structurally diverse groups because members are more likely to encounter unique knowl - edge that has not been shared previously within the group . Proposition . External knowledge sharing will be more strongly associated with performance when work groups are more structurally diverse . Geographic Locations One form of structural diversity originates from dif - ferences in the geographic locations of group mem - bers who can communicate via computer technologies to accomplish their work across vast physical dis - tances ( Cramton 2001 , Jarvenpaa and Leidner 1999 , Maznevski and Chudoba 2000 ) . The “eyes and ears” of members are in different environments , therefore they have access to a greater variety of task - related information , which can open up new opportuni - ties for knowledge sharing ( Monge et al . 1985 ) . Work group members in different locations also likely have different social networks outside of the group because members run into different people in the hallways , see different people at meetings , and communicate socially with different people ( Conrath 1973 ) . However , different geographic locations will only enhance the value of knowledge sharing for work groups if members access unique information about the task through these outside social networks . Hypothesis 1 . External knowledge sharing will be more strongly associated with performance when group members are dispersed across more geographic locations . Functional Assignments Another form of structural diversity is based on member differences in functional assignments , which research suggests can facilitate the integration of expertise , contribute to the successful implementa - tion of projects , and accelerate cycle time for new product development ( Eisenhardt and Tabrizi 1995 , Grifﬁn and Hauser 1992 , Pinto et al . 1993 ) . Advan - tages are realized through this form of structural diversity because the mix of functional assignments in the group draws on differences in member train - ing and experience ( Bunderson and Sutcliffe 2002 ) . The breadth of perspective in the work group can assist the reception and transmission of knowledge from outside of the group ( Cohen and Levinthal 1990 ) . Groups with members representing differ - ent functions can access diverse social networks they have established in their respective domains , such as marketing or manufacturing ( Ancona and Caldwell 1992b ) . For different functional assignments to increase the value of knowledge sharing for work groups though , members must gain unique insight about the project through these external ties . Hypothesis 2 . External knowledge sharing will be more strongly associated with performance when group members represent more functional assignments . Reporting Managers A third form of structural diversity is derived from hierarchical reporting structures in organiza - tions . For example , in matrix organizations , employ - ees report through two or more command systems , one normally related to a function such as engi - neering and another often associated with a prod - uct , like cell phones ( Davis and Lawrence 1977 ) . There are several potential beneﬁts to this form of organization , including increased communication channels and ﬂexibility of resource use ( Ford and Randolph 1992 ) . The implication of having differ - ent reporting managers in groups is that members have access to diverse social networks through their managers . Through these networks , members can Cummings : Work Groups , Structural Diversity , and Knowledge Sharing 354 Management Science 50 ( 3 ) , pp . 352 – 364 , ©2004 INFORMS exchange information that comes down from upper management or through other parts of the organiza - tion ( Burt 1992 ) . However , having different reporting managers will only improve the value of knowledge sharing for work groups if members share unique task knowledge through these hierarchical relationships . Hypothesis 3 . External knowledge sharing will be more strongly associated with performance when group members report to more managers . Business Units Finally , structurally diverse work groups can embody lateral structures in the organization , such as mem - bers working in different business units ( Galbraith 1994 ) . The capability to transfer best practices within the ﬁrm is linked to competitive advantage ( Szulanski 1996 ) , and formal integrative mechanisms ( e . g . , liaisons , task forces , permanent committees ) have been shown to facilitate knowledge ﬂow across the corporation ( Gupta and Govindarajan 2000 ) . In mul - tiunit companies , this form of structural diversity in groups can result in faster project completion time when knowledge is shared effectively across units ( Hansen 2002 ) . Because task information available in one business unit may not be available in another , having members who work in different business units is a useful way to access diverse sources of knowl - edge outside of the group . For different business units to enrich the value of knowledge sharing for work groups , however , members must exchange unique project ideas with others in these external networks . Hypothesis 4 . External knowledge sharing will be more strongly associated with performance when group members work in more business units . Data used to test the above hypotheses ( see Fig - ure 1 for a complete model ) come from a sample of 182 work groups and include ( 1 ) corporate database records , ( 2 ) 20 group interviews , ( 3 ) 182 surveys of group leaders , ( 4 ) 957 surveys of group members , and ( 5 ) senior executives’ ratings of group performance . Through extending ideas about external knowledge sharing to group diversity research , this investigation contributes to a growing literature on the impor - tance of group context for effectiveness ( Ancona and Caldwell 1992a , Hackman 1987 ) . Furthermore , it develops the construct of structural diversity and tests a model of group performance that suggests exter - nal knowledge sharing is most valuable when work groups are structurally diverse . Field Study This study was part of a corporate - wide knowl - edge management initiative in a Fortune 500 telecom - munications ﬁrm . The goal of the initiative was to improve knowledge sharing in a company that produces , among other things , communication tech - nologies such as cell phones , digital pagers , and two - way radios . At the time of the research , the global organization employed more than 100 , 000 indi - viduals , 40 % of whom were engineers . Five divi - sions were organized by product - market segments , operated fairly autonomously , and were respon - sible for development , manufacturing , and sales . Group members in the sample were from recently completed projects across the United States – Canada ( 63 % ) , Latin – South America ( 3 % ) , Europe ( 15 % ) , Mid - dle East – Africa ( 5 % ) , India - China ( 5 % ) , and Japan - Korea - Malaysia ( 9 % ) . Groups worked on projects ranging from product development ( e . g . , design hand - held scanning device for a shipping company ) to service improvement ( e . g . , convert client platform for car phones from analog to digital ) to process management ( e . g . , exe - cute separation and sale of business unit to another stakeholder ) to manufacturing operations ( e . g . , mod - ify existing factory to support new production of pagers ) . The type of project most often determined the composition of the work groups ( average project size was eight members ) , and it was usually either a general manager or a group leader who decided project membership . After agreeing not to disclose the corporation identity , two senior executives gave me permission to contact the work groups . Sample Work groups in the sample participated in a corporate - wide reward and recognition program . The goal of the program was to publicly acknowledge the best - performing work groups in the company . General managers nominated work groups from regional sites around the world to participate in the competition . Each group was asked to make a 20 – 30 minute presentation to a panel of judges ( 5 – 12 senior executives ) who were given speciﬁc training regard - ing the process . In most cases , judges were unfamiliar with the projects before they made their ratings , given the large size of the corporation . Performance for work group members was tied to raises , promotions , and reputation in the ﬁrm , so everyone involved took the events seriously . Senior executives ﬁrst rated 280 groups at more than 20 regional events worldwide . The 122 groups at each of the events that were judged the highest advanced to ﬁve separate division - level events , where a different panel of judges again rated the groups . The 21 division - level groups that were judged the highest moved on to a ﬁnal corporate - level event , where they made presentations to the company CEO and senior vice - presidents . Background information could not be found for 98 of the 280 work groups , so this sam - ple includes 84 / 137 ( 61 % ) of groups participating in Cummings : Work Groups , Structural Diversity , and Knowledge Sharing Management Science 50 ( 3 ) , pp . 352 – 364 , ©2004 INFORMS 355 Figure 1 Model of Knowledge Sharing , Structural Diversity , and Performance in Work Groups Knowledge Sharing Intragroup Exchange of general overviews , specific requirements , analytical techniques , progress reports , and results among members External Exchange of general overviews , specific requirements , analytical techniques , progress reports , and results with other division members , non - division members , or customers Geographic Locations ( H1 ) Group members reside in different buildings Performance Management evaluations of teamwork , problem selection , method used to solve problem , innovativeness of remedies , quality of impact from results , institutionalism of solution , and clarity of presentation + + + Structural Diversity Functional Assignments ( H2 ) Group members are assigned to different functions Reporting Managers ( H3 ) Group members report to different managers Business Units ( H4 ) Group members work in different business units Note . “H” indicates hypotheses . the regional events , 77 / 122 ( 63 % ) of groups partici - pating in the division - level events , and 21 / 21 ( 100 % ) of groups participating in the corporate - level event . In this sample of 182 work groups , members generally came from within the same division ( 5 % of groups reported having a member from another division ) ; almost all were company employees ( 8 % of groups reported having one customer participate ) . Roughly 70 % were male , the average age was 38 , and members had an average of 7 and 13 years of company and industry experience , respectively . Ninety - four percent of the projects started and ended between January 1998 and January 2000 ( average project length was 15 months ) . Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence . Division managers provided archival data on the groups , including project documentation , presentation slides , and other available written materials . Exploratory interviews were conducted with all members of 20 work groups to learn about the nature of the projects and to develop surveys used later . I then contacted group leaders to verify project descrip - tions , member names , geographic locations , func - tional assignments , reporting managers , and business units . After gathering background information on the 182 work groups in the sample , I created a sur - vey with questions about knowledge sharing within and outside of the group . I pretested the survey on employees in the corporate ofﬁce before sending it out in June 2000 as an e - mail attachment to each group member who had a valid e - mail address ( 1 , 315 / 1 , 474 or 89 % ) . The survey was sent an average of six months after groups had completed their projects , took approximately 20 – 30 minutes to complete , and included a cover letter describing the purpose of the study and ensuring conﬁdentiality . The response rate for those who were sent an e - mail survey , includ - ing two follow - up reminders , was 73 % ( 957 / 1 , 315 ) . 1 There was at least one respondent from each work group , and responses were averaged across members and applied to the entire group . 1 Selection bias analyses were conducted at the group level of anal - ysis ( N = 182 ) . Analyses revealed no association between response rate and group size , available resources , environmental uncertainty , geographic locations , reporting managers , or business units . How - ever , project length ( r = 0 (cid:3) 21 , p < 0 (cid:3) 01 ) , functional assignments ( r = 0 (cid:3) 17 , p < 0 (cid:3) 05 ) , and performance ( r = 0 (cid:3) 24 , p < 0 (cid:3) 01 ) were asso - ciated with a higher percentage of survey responses . Cummings : Work Groups , Structural Diversity , and Knowledge Sharing 356 Management Science 50 ( 3 ) , pp . 352 – 364 , ©2004 INFORMS Measures Control Variables . Previous research on work groups suggests that task type , group size , project length , availability of project resources , and environ - mental uncertainty may inﬂuence group performance . Based on labels used in the corporation , tasks were categorized as ( 1 ) Product Development ( 25 % ) ( Product : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 25 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 43 ) ; ( 2 ) Service Improvement ( 25 % ) ( Service : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 25 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 43 ) ; ( 3 ) Process Management ( 25 % ) ( Process : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 25 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 43 ) ; or ( 4 ) Manufacturing Operations ( 26 % ) ( Operations : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 26 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 44 ) . Group leaders indicated the number of members in the group ( Size : Mean = 8 (cid:3) 10 ; SD = 1 (cid:3) 94 ) and the number of months from the start of the project to the end ( Length : Mean = 14 (cid:3) 96 ; SD = 10 (cid:3) 53 ) . They also assessed the availability of three project resources ( Ancona and Caldwell 1992b ) : “On average , to what extent did the project have available resources (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) ” : ( 1 ) ﬁnancial , ( 2 ) personnel , and ( 3 ) equipment ( 10 - point scale : 1—not very available ; 5—average ; 10—very much available ) , which reliably loaded onto one factor ( (cid:6) = 0 (cid:3) 80 ; Resources : Mean = 6 (cid:3) 22 ; SD = 2 (cid:3) 04 ) , and environmental uncertainty ( Brown and Utterback 1985 , Tushman 1979 ) ; that is , “On average , to what extent did the project need skills or informa - tion that were stable or rapidly changing” ( 10 - point scale : 1—stable ; 5—average ; 10—rapidly changing ) ( higher value indicates greater uncertainty ) ( Uncer - tainty : Mean = 5 (cid:3) 66 ; SD = 2 (cid:3) 49 ) . Demographic Diversity . Consistent with previous research , the coefﬁcient of variation ( i . e . , standard deviation of group members divided by the mean for the group ) was used to compute demographic diver - sity ( Allison 1978 ) . At the end of the survey , group members reported their sex ( 1—male ; 2—female ) , age ( in years ) , company experience ( in years ) , and indus - try experience ( in years ) . The coefﬁcient of varia - tion ranged from 0 . 00 to 0 . 47 for variation in sex ( Sex : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 24 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 17 ) , 0 . 00 to 0 . 58 for vari - ation in age ( Age : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 29 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 12 ) , 0 . 00 to 0 . 70 for variation in company experience ( Company : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 31 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 15 ) , and 0 . 00 to 0 . 73 for varia - tion in industry experience ( Industry : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 28 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 15 ) . Structural Diversity . An entropy - based index ( Teachman 1980 ) was used to compute each measure of structural diversity H = − s (cid:1) i − 1 P i (cid:11) ln P i (cid:12)(cid:3) According to Ancona and Caldwell ( 1992b ) , “if there are N possible states { s } in which the system can be , { and } P i is the probability that the system will be found in state i , then the formula can be used to index the heterogeneity { H } in the system (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) the only excep - tion occurs when a { state } is not represented . In this case , the value assigned that state is zero” ( p . 328 ) . The greater the dispersion of group members across states , the higher the score on the index ( the theoreti - cal maximum depends on the number of states ) . The data used for the four measures of struc - tural diversity came from corporate database records . Geographic locations were deﬁned as the building code where group members worked , and the index ranged from 0 . 00 to 2 . 04 ( Locations : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 52 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 52 ) . Functional assignments were deﬁned as the functions assigned in the work group : engineer - ing ( 29 % ) , manufacturing ( 20 % ) , technical operations ( 14 % ) , quality ( 7 % ) , marketing / strategy ( 5 % ) , cus - tomer service ( 4 % ) , project management ( 4 % ) , infor - mation technology ( 4 % ) , administrative support ( 3 % ) , sales ( 3 % ) , human resources ( 2 % ) , ﬁnance ( 2 % ) , busi - ness administration ( 2 % ) , and purchasing ( 1 % ) . The index ranged from 0 . 00 to 1 . 89 ( Functions : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 90 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 47 ) . Reporting managers were deﬁned as the managers’ members reported to in the work group , and the index ranged from 0 . 38 to 2 . 48 ( Managers : Mean = 1 (cid:3) 74 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 41 ) . Finally , business units were deﬁned as the business units where mem - bers worked , and the index ranged from 0 . 00 to 2 . 04 ( Units : Mean = 0 (cid:3) 52 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 48 ) . Knowledge Sharing . Three steps went into devel - oping the measures of knowledge sharing reported here . First , I conducted 20 face - to - face interviews with group members to assess the different kinds of knowl - edge that they shared during their projects . Second , I analyzed the transcripts from group member inter - views and reviewed previous research ( Hansen 1999 , Szulanski 1996 , Zander and Kogut 1995 ) . Together , they suggested ﬁve types of knowledge sharing in these work groups : ( 1 ) general overviews , ( 2 ) speciﬁc requirements , ( 3 ) analytical techniques , ( 4 ) progress reports , and ( 5 ) project results . 2 The frequency of knowledge sharing within and outside of the group was assessed on a 5 - point scale ( 1—never ; 2— rarely ; 3—sometimes ; 4—regularly ; 5—a lot ) . The third step I took was to aggregate the ﬁve types of knowledge to form separate scales for intra - group ( Intragroup KS : Mean = 3 (cid:3) 90 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 39 ) and 2 For purposes of reliability , members were asked questions about knowledge sharing during the planning phase and completion phase of their projects . Preliminary analyses did not reveal any knowledge sharing by phase interactions , so responses were aver - aged to assess overall knowledge sharing ( average correlation for knowledge sharing between phases was r = 0 (cid:3) 83 ) . Furthermore , there were no identiﬁable differences among the targets of external knowledge sharing ( nongroup employees inside the division , non - group employees outside the division , and the customer ) , so they were combined for the analyses reported below ( (cid:6) = 0 (cid:3) 78 ) .

Loadings smaller than 0 . 24 are not shown . external knowledge sharing ( External KS : Mean = 2 (cid:3) 38 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 58 ; see Table 1 for a factor analy - sis ) . Many employees reported sharing little exter - nal knowledge—39 % ( 371 / 957 ) of members reported sharing knowledge outside of the group “rarely” ( rat - ing of 2 / 5 ) or less during their projects . Work groups shared signiﬁcantly more knowledge within than out - side of the group ( t(cid:11) 181 (cid:12) = 37 (cid:3) 54 , p < 0 (cid:3) 001 ) . Work Group Performance . Senior executives rated work groups in the corporate - wide reward and recog - nition program on seven dimensions : ( 1 ) teamwork , ( 2 ) clearly deﬁned problem selection , ( 3 ) appropriate - ness of method used to solve problem , ( 4 ) innovative - ness of remedies used to solve problem , ( 5 ) quality of impact from results , ( 6 ) institutionalization of solu - tion , and ( 7 ) clarity of presentation . An analysis of a typical event ( N = 12 judges and N = 33 groups ) revealed that judges were able to reliably rate overall performance ( (cid:6) = 0 (cid:3) 88 across judges ) , and suggested a halo effect in which all seven dimensions loaded onto one factor ( (cid:6) = 0 (cid:3) 80 across dimensions ) . The performance measure used here is based on the high - est level reached in the competition , therefore , the 182 groups were given a ranking of 0 ( regional level , N = 84 ) , 1 ( division level , N = 77 ) , or 2 ( corporate level , N = 21 ) ( Level : Mean = 1 (cid:3) 65 ; SD = 0 (cid:3) 68 ) . Results Preliminary Analyses Before testing the hypotheses discussed earlier , pre - liminary analyses were conducted on the data . First , descriptive statistics revealed that all variables were normally distributed , except for project length ( which was skewed toward longer projects ) , thus , the natural log of project length is used in the analyses . Second , intraclass correlations justifying a group - level analysis were signiﬁcant for intragroup and external knowl - edge sharing . 3 Further inspection of the intragroup and external knowledge sharing measures did not reveal the presence of individuals with particularly high levels of activity . For example , successful groups had an average of 3 . 6 members who reported sharing knowledge outside of the group at least sometimes , 3 One - way analyses of variance ( ANOVA ) were conducted with intragroup and external knowledge sharing as the dependent vari - ables and group membership as the independent variable ( 1 – 149 ) on groups where at least 50 % of the members completed the sur - vey ( N = 871 cases ) . Intraclass correlations indicate the extent to which within - group responses are similar to one another but dif - ferent from other groups , as determined by signiﬁcance of the ANOVA ( Kenny and LaVoie 1985 ) . There was agreement among group members for external ( F (cid:11) 148 (cid:15) 870 (cid:12) = 3 (cid:3) 51 , p < 0 (cid:3) 0001 , ICC = 0 (cid:3) 24 ) and intragroup ( F (cid:11) 148 (cid:15) 870 (cid:12) = 1 (cid:3) 75 , p < 0 (cid:3) 0001 , ICC = 0 (cid:3) 09 ) knowledge sharing .

Third , correlations were calculated for the main vari - ables in the study ( see Table 2 ) . It is important to note that while the four measures of structural diver - sity were signiﬁcantly intercorrelated ( average r = 0 (cid:3) 29 , p < 0 (cid:3) 01 ) , they were not strongly related to intra - group or external knowledge sharing ( Intragroup : average r = − 0 (cid:3) 12 , p > 0 (cid:3) 10 ; External : average r = 0 (cid:3) 07 , p > 0 (cid:3) 10 ) . Hypothesis Testing Ordered logit analysis , appropriate when the depen - dent variable is ordinal , estimates the odds of reaching a higher level of the dependent variable . In the case of work group performance , the coef - ﬁcient estimates indicate the probability of a work group reaching the regional level , division level , or corporate level of the competition . Table 3 ( Model 1 ) shows the results of the ordered logit analysis , and for parsimony , the only signiﬁcant control vari - able , group size ( b = 0 (cid:3) 21 , p < 0 (cid:3) 01 ) . Models 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 show the effects of geographic locations , func - tional assignments , reporting managers , and business units , respectively , as well as intragroup and external knowledge sharing . In each case , intragroup ( aver - age b = 1 (cid:3) 14 , p < 0 (cid:3) 05 ) and external knowledge shar - ing ( average b = 0 (cid:3) 95 , p < 0 (cid:3) 01 ) were signiﬁcantly associated with performance , but the measures of structural diversity were not . In support of Hypothesis 1 , Table 2 ( Model 3 ) shows that the interaction of external knowledge sharing and geographic locations was signiﬁcantly associated with performance ( b = 0 (cid:3) 37 , p < 0 (cid:3) 05 ) , and that the change in R 2 from Model 2 ( 0 . 20 ) to Model 3 ( 0 . 22 ) was marginally signiﬁcant ( (cid:19)R 2 = 0 (cid:3) 02 ; F = 2 (cid:3) 60 , p < 0 (cid:3) 10 ) . The interaction plot shows that greater external knowledge sharing was related to better per - formance when there were more geographic locations ( see Figure 2a ) . In support of Hypothesis 2 , Table 2 ( Model 5 ) shows that the interaction of external knowledge sharing and functional assignments was also signiﬁcantly associated with performance ( b = 0 (cid:3) 52 , p < 0 (cid:3) 01 ) , and the change in R 2 from Model 4 ( 0 . 21 ) to Model 5 ( 0 . 25 ) was signiﬁcant ( (cid:19)R 2 = 0 (cid:3) 04 ; F = 4 (cid:3) 20 , p < 0 (cid:3) 05 ) . The interaction plot shows that greater external knowledge sharing was related to better performance when there were more functional assignments ( see Figure 2b ) . In support of Hypothesis 3 , Table 2 ( column 7 ) shows that the interaction of external knowledge sharing and reporting managers was signiﬁcantly associated with performance ( b = 0 (cid:3) 49 , p < 0 (cid:3) 05 ) , and the change in R 2 from Model 6 ( 0 . 20 ) to Model 7 ( 0 . 24 ) was signiﬁcant ( (cid:19)R 2 = 0 (cid:3) 04 ; F = 4 (cid:3) 34 , p < 0 (cid:3) 05 ) .

Standard errors are in parentheses below unstandardized coefﬁcients . Independent variables were centered before computing interactions . The degrees of freedom reﬂect the intercepts and nonsigniﬁcant control variables not report here . R 2 and (cid:11)R 2 were computed in a separate analysis using ordinary least squares regression . The interaction plot shows that external knowledge sharing was related to better performance when there was a greater number of reporting managers ( see Figure 2c ) . Finally , in partial support of Hypothesis 4 , Table 2 ( column 9 ) shows that the interaction of external knowledge sharing and business units had a marginally signiﬁcant association with performance ( b = 0 (cid:3) 36 , p < 0 (cid:3) 10 ) . The interaction plot shows that more external knowledge sharing was related to better performance when there was a greater num - ber of business units ( see Figure 2d ) , however , the change in R 2 from Model 1 ( 0 . 20 ) to Model 4 ( 0 . 21 ) was not signiﬁcant ( (cid:19)R 2 = 0 (cid:3) 01 ; F = 1 (cid:3) 51 , p > 0 (cid:3) 10 ) . The interaction of intragroup knowledge sharing and each measure of structural diversity was not related to performance in any of the models . 4 Additional analyses were conducted to further explore the proposition made at the beginning of this paper , that external knowledge sharing will be more strongly associated with performance when work groups are more structurally diverse . First , I created a composite measure of structural diversity by standardizing each measure separately ( i . e . , geographic locations , functional assignments , 4 When all main effects and interactions are entered into one model , none of the interactions are signiﬁcant . This is probably a result of the mutual partialling that occurred among correlated interaction terms ( average r = 0 (cid:3) 31 , p < 0 (cid:3) 05 ) .

As expected , Table 3 ( col - umn 10 ) shows the interaction between external knowledge sharing and a composite measure of structural diversity was signiﬁcantly associated with performance ( b = 0 (cid:3) 66 , p < 0 (cid:3) 01 ) , but the other inter - actions were not . Second , I substituted measures of demographic diversity ( i . e . , sex , age , company experi - ence , industry experience ) for measures of structural diversity . Table 4 shows the results of these ordered logit analyses with performance as the dependent variable . None of the interactions between intragroup and external knowledge sharing and measures of demographic diversity were related to performance . Discussion In this paper , I argue that external knowledge sharing is more valuable when groups are more structurally diverse . Members in different locations , who represent different functions , who report to different managers , and who work in different business units can bene - ﬁt from unique sources of knowledge outside of the group . Two themes characterize the ﬁndings of this paper . First , consistent with previous research , both intragroup and external knowledge sharing are impor - tant for performance in work groups . The main effects of knowledge sharing on performance were reliably signiﬁcant . Second , in support of the four hypotheses , external knowledge sharing was more strongly associ - ated with performance when work groups were more structurally diverse . In contrast , demographic diver - sity did not yield the same beneﬁts , suggesting that not all sources of diversity in work groups enhance the value of knowledge .

Their device turned out to be innovative , in part , because of the knowledge shared through a local connection . In another example , a service improvement group was responsible for upgrading a wireless network . Mem - bers represented the functions of project management , quality , and engineering . Instead of conducting their own consumer research , the group gathered satisfac - tion data from employees who shared the same func - tion as one of the members ( quality ) . Their upgrade became a success , in part , because of information gath - ered through the functional ties of a group member . In a third example , a manufacturing operations group needed to oversee the conversion from pagers to cell phones at a production facility in Ireland . Nine members were located in Ireland and Scotland and represented technical operations , quality , and engi - neering . Instead of generating their own documen - tation for next steps , members used their manager’s contacts to benchmark another factory in Scotland . Their conversion was effective , in part , because of knowledge gained through a manager’s social net - work . In a ﬁnal example , a process management group was asked to streamline corporate communi - cations to cut costs and reduce the potential of mis - communication with employees and customers . Ten members from human resources , marketing , and cus - tomer service worked in business units across three divisions . Instead of only relying on what they already knew , members ensured that management Cummings : Work Groups , Structural Diversity , and Knowledge Sharing 362 Management Science 50 ( 3 ) , pp . 352 – 364 , ©2004 INFORMS boards from multiple divisions endorsed the pro - posal . Their recommendations were well received , in part , because of feedback gained through ties in the various business units . While this paper focused on the potential ben - eﬁts of structural diversity in work groups , sev - eral lines of research suggest there may be costs as well . For example , research has shown that geographic distance makes many aspects of intra - group communication more difﬁcult because of the reduced opportunities for informal contact ( Kiesler and Cummings 2002 ) . In addition , the intragroup communication challenges for cross - functional groups are often strenuous because members cannot bridge different “thought worlds” ( Dougherty 1992 ) . And when members of work groups have to report to dif - ferent managers , they may get contradictory demands or experience role ambiguity ( Ford and Randolph 1992 ) . Finally , members who work in different busi - ness units may ﬁnd that knowledge transfer is dif - ﬁcult or “sticky” ( Szulanski 1996 ) . In work groups studied here , however , the beneﬁts of structural diver - sity seemed to outweigh the potential costs of poor intragroup functioning , though additional evidence is needed on conﬂict , coordination , and cohesiveness , which were not measured in this study . On average , members of structurally diverse groups in this study did not share less intragroup knowledge than members of homogeneous groups . Moreover , structurally diverse groups did not per - form better or worse than homogeneous groups . The chances of better performance increase when more knowledge is shared among group members and with others in their external social networks . While pre - vious work has addressed the role of gatekeepers or boundary spanners in sharing knowledge outside of the group ( e . g . , Allen 1977 ) , there did not appear to be any patterns suggesting that successful groups in this sample had specialized members who engaged in this activity . There are several alternative explanations for why external knowledge sharing was beneﬁcial for performance when groups were more structurally diverse . First , performance was rated at each of the regional , division , and corporate events roughly six months before group members completed the surveys . Although senior executives did not give detailed feedback to groups regarding their per - formance , all groups knew whether or not they advanced to the next level . Participants could have responded to the survey in a way that conformed to their intuitions about performance , though it is unlikely that members were aware of an interaction effect of external knowledge sharing and each mea - sure of structural diversity . Second , work groups with better performing members may have shared more knowledge because of opportunities they created , thus , it may not have been that knowledge sharing resulted in better performance , but rather that better performance resulted in more knowledge sharing . However , in either case , the data reported here are cross sectional , and claims about causality cannot be substantiated . Limitations There are also several limitations of this ﬁeld study . The sample was chosen opportunistically ; there is no documented information on how representative the work groups are in terms of size , membership , or capabilities . One reason for the low R 2 in the analy - ses testing the hypotheses ( which ranged from 0 . 19 to 0 . 25 , see Table 3 ) may be that variance was restricted on the dependent variable because only moderately to highly successful groups were examined . The sam - ple bias in favor of successful groups also limits the generalizability of the results , though the hypothe - sis tests were likely conservative given the paucity of low - performing groups . Given these limitations , read - ers should proceed cautiously when interpreting the results . Another concern involves the measurement of knowledge sharing , and the measurement error from the self - report survey in particular . Because surveys were administered an average of six months after the projects , distinctions between time periods , types of knowledge , and targets of external knowledge shar - ing were likely blurred in the minds of participants . Future research should examine different measures of knowledge sharing content and networks , as well as better metrics for capturing knowledge sharing ( e . g . , ways for members to count actual conversations , doc - uments , or transfers of information ) . This study examined only one aspect of the many kinds of interactions people can have in work groups . Interactions other than knowledge sharing are unac - counted for here . Evidence is also missing on the quality of the knowledge being shared . It is likely that diverse external sources may matter even more when the knowledge is timely or scarce . It also remains indeterminate under what conditions it is better to be the source or recipient of knowledge , and how knowledge sharing can negatively impact per - formance . Surely , all knowledge is not critical to have , and sometimes it is better to give than to receive . It is also uncertain how knowledge sharing would occur under conditions of competition or hostility among groups in the corporation . The culture of this orga - nization may be special in that it encouraged diver - sity and knowledge sharing outside of work groups . Replicating these ﬁndings in other companies is rec - ommended to fully understand the role of knowledge sharing in global organizations . Cummings : Work Groups , Structural Diversity , and Knowledge Sharing Management Science 50 ( 3 ) , pp . 352 – 364 , ©2004 INFORMS 363 Implications A theoretical contribution of this paper was the integration of ideas about knowledge sharing and diversity in work groups . In particular , structural diversity was introduced as an important concept for bridging group members to the larger orga - nizational context . Geographic locations , functional assignments , reporting managers , and business units were linked together for the ﬁrst time as critical features of group structure . Furthermore , the results suggest that there are performance beneﬁts for struc - turally diverse groups when members share knowl - edge outside of the group . While previous research has primarily focused on the intragroup consequences of diversity , the external perspective discussed here builds on recent work emphasizing the signiﬁcance of diverse knowledge networks throughout an orga - nization ( Hansen 2002 ) . Viewing work groups as part of a broader organizational network has implications for how group members are selected to participate , where resources to support group processes come from , and why some groups are more effective than others . Additional research is needed at the intersec - tion of work groups and social networks ( Cummings and Cross 2003 ) , including which network structures are most effective for facilitating knowledge sharing outside of the group . A clear practical message from this study is that managers should be explicit about the importance of external knowledge sharing in work groups . When asked why group members did not share knowl - edge externally , there were three general responses : ( 1 ) “Why do I need to share knowledge externally , my group has everything it needs , ” ( 2 ) “I would like to share knowledge externally , but I don’t know who to share it with , ” and ( 3 ) “I am not supported or rewarded for sharing knowledge externally . ” More generally , managers could ( 1 ) design work groups to include members with strong external networks who value interacting outside of the group , and can use their ties to the group’s advantage , ( 2 ) look for ways to improve the connectivity among their employ - ees , such as cross - functional workshops or knowl - edge fairs that offer an arena for bringing people together , and ( 3 ) foster a culture that supports knowl - edge sharing and provides incentives for employ - ees to participate , either through their performance evaluation or public recognition . More speciﬁcally , when external knowledge sharing does not natu - rally occur , managers could assign extramural liaison roles in the group to connect with relevant parts of the organization . For multinational corporations that want to have successful work groups well into the twenty - ﬁrst century , encouraging external knowledge sharing through structurally diverse groups is a fruit - ful possibility .
