Ca 2 (cid:2) / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) mediate TGF (cid:3) - induced trans - duction of ﬁbronectin and collagen in human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts . Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 312 : L510 – L519 , 2017 . First published January 27 , 2017 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajplung . 00084 . 2016 . —It is now clear that in addition to activating several complex kinase pathways ( Smad , MAP kinase , PI3 kinase ) , TGF (cid:3) also acts by elevating cytosolic Ca 2 (cid:2) concentration within human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts . Ca 2 (cid:2) / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CamK II ) is also known to regulate gene expression in ﬁbroblasts . In this study , we examined the interactions between calcium signaling , activation of CamK and other kinases , and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) gene ex - pression . Human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts were cultured and stimulated with artiﬁcially generated Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses in the absence of TGF (cid:3) , or with TGF (cid:3) ( 1 nM ) or vehicle in the presence of various blockers of Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling . PCR and Western blotting were used to measure gene expression and protein levels , respectively . We found that Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses in the absence of TGF (cid:3) increased ECM gene expression in a pulse frequency - dependent manner , and that blocking Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling and the CamK II pathway signiﬁcantly reduced TGF (cid:3) - mediated ECM gene expression , without having any effects on other kinase pathways ( Smad , PI3 kinase , or MAP kinase ) . We also found that TGF (cid:3) elevated the expression of CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) , while siRNA silencing of those two subtypes signiﬁcantly reduced TGF (cid:3) - mediated expression of collagen A1 and ﬁbronectin 1 . Our data suggest that TGF (cid:3) induces the expression of CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) , which in turn are activated by TGF (cid:3) - evoked Ca 2 (cid:2) waves in a frequency - dependent manner , leading to increased expression of ECM proteins . Ca signaling ; ﬁbrosis ; extracellular matrix ; Cam kinase PULMONARY FIBROSIS is characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) in the alveolar and interstitial spaces , severely compromising gas exchange ( 21 ) . To date there is a lack of effective therapies that stop the progression of ﬁbrosis . Fibroblasts are key cellular mediators responsible for the structural changes that occur in ﬁbrotic lung diseases ( 44 ) . TGF (cid:3) promotes differentiation of ﬁbroblasts toward a secre - tory phenotype , which is responsible for secreting excessive metalloproteinases , matrix proteins , and cytokines . Although the Smad pathway is the best explored canonical pathway of TGF (cid:3) signaling , several studies suggested that TGF (cid:3) signaling also involves mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) ( 3 , 10 , 14 , 37 ) , GTPases ( 10 ) , protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( 37 ) , and (cid:3) - catenin ( 15 ) . In addition to activating these kinase pathways , TGF (cid:3) also induces the elevation of intracellular Ca 2 (cid:2) concentration ( [ Ca 2 (cid:2) ] i ) . In our previous studies ( 30 ) we have shown that TGF (cid:3) evokes rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients that correlate with [ TGF (cid:3) ] ( brackets denote concentration ) , and that disruption of those Ca 2 (cid:2) transients attenuates the expres - sion of collagen and ﬁbronectin genes in cultured cells ( 30 ) and in a bleomycin model of pulmonary ﬁbrosis ( 28 ) . We also showed that those rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients are dependent on the release of Ca 2 (cid:2) from the endoplasmic reticulum via a ryanodine channel ( 30 ) as well as the inﬂux of external Ca 2 (cid:2) via L - type voltage - gated channels ( 28 ) . Many groups have described complex interactions between Ca 2 (cid:2) handling and gene transcription in a wide variety of cell types other than pulmonary ﬁbroblasts , including induction of expression in a manner that is dependent on the Ca 2 (cid:2) oscilla - tion frequency ( 8 , 9 ) . In many cases , the transducer of these growth factor - evoked Ca 2 (cid:2) oscillations is Ca 2 (cid:2) / calmodulin - dependent kinase II ( CamK II ) ( 40 , 42 , 43 ) . Calmodulin , upon forming a complex with four Ca 2 (cid:2) ions , activates CamK II . Activated CamK II then phosphorylates a variety of targets , which can include Smad2 and Smad4 ( 1 , 45 , 50 ) . TGF (cid:3) - triggered Ca 2 (cid:2) events regulate different cellular events like gene expression ( collagens I and III ; ﬁbronectin ; PAI - 1 ) ( 2 , 30 ) , inhibition of other transcription factors ( 4 , 5 , 7 , 32 ) , cell viability ( 49 ) and proliferation ( 49 ) . Until now , no study has explored how these rhythmic TGF (cid:3) - mediated Ca 2 (cid:2) transients regulate ECM gene expression in human pulmonary ﬁbro - blasts . In this study , we examined the mechanistic pathway by which Ca 2 (cid:2) ions regulate TGF (cid:3) - mediated ECM gene expres - sion in human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts . Primary human pulmo - nary ﬁbroblasts were cultured and treated with TGF (cid:3) 1 and different Ca 2 (cid:2) channel blockers under various conditions . Changes in different protein levels were measured with West - ern blot and changes in ECM gene expression under various conditions were assessed with RT - PCR . We found that , in absence of any external growth factor , rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) tran - sients alone are sufﬁcient to regulate gene expression . We also found that different blockers of internal Ca 2 (cid:2) store had no effects on TGF (cid:3) - mediated Smad , PI3K , or MAPK pathways but signiﬁcantly inhibited the CamK pathway . On the other hand , we found that KN93 , an inhibitor of CamK activity , signiﬁcantly reduced the TGF (cid:3) - mediated overexpression of ECM genes . These results suggest the involvement of CamK pathway on TGF (cid:3) - mediated ECM gene expression . Most in - terestingly , we also found that silencing CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) genes reduced TGF (cid:3) - mediated ECM gene expression .

Oregon Green Ca 2 (cid:2) dye , RPMI medium , and Hank’s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) were obtained from Invitrogen . Ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid ( CPA ) were purchased from Tocris Bioscience . All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich Chemical . Isolation and Culture of Fibroblasts All experiment procedures were approved by the St . Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton Board of Ethics ( research protocol no . 00 - 1839 ) . Human primary ﬁbroblasts were obtained from ﬁve different patients ( three male and two female , aged 60 – 80 yr ) undergoing lung surgery following informed consent . Lung tissues were taken from macro - scopically normal lung areas that were as distant from the nodules as possible . Lung tissues were minced into pieces (cid:5) 2 mm and then cultivated in 35 - mm tissue culture dishes in explant medium ( RPMI (cid:2) 20 % FBS (cid:2) antibiotics ) at 37°C in 95 % air - 5 % CO 2 . After 2 – 3 wk , outgrowing cells were trypsinized and subcultured in 75 - cm 2 culture ﬂasks for further growth . These cells , designated passage 1 , were cultivated in standard growth medium ( RPMI (cid:2) 10 % FBS (cid:2) antibi - otics ) at 37°C in 95 % air - 5 % CO 2 , and the culture medium was changed three times per week . On the other hand , cells for confocal microscopy were cultured in glass - bottom Petri dishes in the same growth medium . All cells in the experiments were used between passages 3 and 10 ( 30 ) . We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that the cells we cultured are indeed ﬁbroblasts as we described in our previous study ( 29 ) . We checked the expression of collagen A1 , ﬁbronectin 1 , and smooth muscle actin . We found that expression of collagen A1 and ﬁbronectin 1 genes ( markers for ﬁbroblasts ) were signiﬁcantly higher than that of the smooth muscle actin gene ( marker for smooth muscle cells ) ( 29 ) . This result conﬁrmed that the cells we are working with are actually ﬁbroblast cells . Generating Artiﬁcial Ca 2 (cid:2) Pulses Without Any External Growth Factor We designed an apparatus that incubates the cells at 37°C and pulses them with two different solutions at regular intervals for hours ( Fig . 1 A ) at frequencies that mirror the physiologically relevant ones described in our previous studies ( 29 , 30 ) . In this way , it was possible for us to simulate the recurring Ca 2 (cid:2) transients for hours at a time without addition of growth factor , providing an elegant tool to determine the nature of the Ca 2 (cid:2) signals that are necessary to generate transcriptional responses . In brief , we cultured human pulmonary ﬁbroblast cells on glass slides ; after the cells were conﬂuent the slides were placed in a 37°C chamber and continuously perfused with Ca 2 (cid:2) - free HBSS buffer warmed to 37°C from a buffer chamber outside . We have previously shown that this depletes the cells of internal Ca 2 (cid:2) ( 30 ) , which in turn will open Ca 2 (cid:2) - permeable store - reﬁlling pathways ( “functionally permeabilizing” the cells ) . Cells were then pulsed intermittently with HBSS buffer containing normal Ca 2 (cid:2) , which would produce a transient elevation of [ Ca 2 (cid:2) ] i , mimick - ing a single Ca 2 (cid:2) transient . Pulse frequencies were regulated by a pulse generator ( Grass S88 stimulator ) . Cells were randomly classiﬁed into ﬁve groups . Control group cells were perfused continuously with nominally Ca 2 (cid:2) - free HBSS alone for 5 h ( we have previously esti - Fig . 1 .

B : ﬂuorescence tracings of pulses ( 10 - s duration ) recorded at 0 . 2 frames per second ( left ) and 1 frame per second ( right ) , as indicated .

Four other groups of cells were perfused continuously with nominally Ca 2 (cid:2) - free HBSS and given pulses ( 10 s duration ) with normal ( Ca 2 (cid:2) - contain - ing ) HBSS at regular intervals of 200 , 120 , 100 , or 60 s ( i . e . , frequencies of 0 . 3 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 6 , or 1 . 0 Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses per minute , respec - tively ) for a total of 5 h . In our previous study , these Ca 2 (cid:2) transient frequencies were elicited by TGF (cid:3) at concentrations that stimulated the cells ~ 15 , 40 , 60 , and 90 % , respectively ( 30 ) . After the experi - ments , slides with cultured ﬁbroblasts were washed with diethyl pyrocarbonate ( DEPC ) - treated water three times and total RNA was isolated from the cells on the slides with 500 (cid:7) l TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions , and dissolved in DEPC - treated water and stored at (cid:8) 80°C until use for RT - PCR . Protein Isolation and Western Blot The cultured human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) that contained 20 mM Tris·HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM Na 2 EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 2 . 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mM (cid:3) - glycerophosphate , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 (cid:7) g / ml leupeptin , 10 mM sodium ﬂuoride , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 (cid:9) protease inhibitor cocktail and the lysates were collected after a brief sonication . The lysates were then centrifuged at 4°C and 14 , 000 g for 10 min . The supernatant was collected and frozen at (cid:8) 80°C until use . Total protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay . Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose mem - branes ( 30 ) . The membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat dry milk and probed with a 1 : 1 , 000 dilution of primary antibody overnight . Smad 2 , p - Smad 2 , p - AKT , AKT , p - ERK , ERK , and p - CamK II ( Thr286 ) primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology ( Whitby , ON , Canada ) . CamK II was obtained from Millipore ( Eto - bicoke , ON , Canada ) . CamK II (cid:3) , CamK II (cid:4) , and ﬁbronectin antibod - ies were obtained from Abcam ( Toronto , ON , Canada ) . Antibody against (cid:3) - actin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . The protein bands were detected using horseradish per - oxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 2 , 000 dilution ) ( Cell Sig - naling Technology ) and Western blot detection reagent ( GE Health - care ) . The bands were digitized , subjected to densitometric scanning using a standard image program , and normalized against the loading control . Speciﬁcity of the antibodies used were veriﬁed from prior published studies ( p - SMAD 2 and SMAD 2 Refs . 26 , 46 ; p - AKT and AKT Ref . 47 ; ERK Ref . 27 ; p - ERK Ref . 22 ; CamK II Ref . 11 ) . Precision Plus Protein all - blue prestained protein standards ( Bio - Rad , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) were used as molecular weight markers ; since these do not appear in the radiographic ﬁlms , they were marked in with an ink pen . RNA Isolation and RT - PCR Total RNA was isolated from the cultured ﬁbroblasts with 1 ml TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s in - structions , and dissolved in DEPC - treated water . Total RNA con - centration and integrity were determined with a microgel bioana - lyzer ( Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 ; Agilent , Mississauga , ON , Can - ada ) as described previously ( 29 ) , 1 (cid:7) g of RNA was treated with DNase and reverse transcribed using qScript cDNA SuperMix ( Quanta Bioscience , Gaithersburg , MD ) . The cDNA was ampliﬁed by PCR , using Platinum PCR SuperMix ( Invitrogen ) following a semi - quantitative RT - PCR technique . The primers used are listed in Table 1 . The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis in 1 % agarose gel ( Bio - Rad ) with RedSafe Nucleic Acid staining solution ( FroggaBio , Toronto , ON , Canada ) . Quantitative real - time PCR was conducted by the TaqMan method using the ABI Prism 7500 PCR system ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( 29 ) . RT - PCR probe and primer sets ( gene expression assays ) were purchased from Applied Biosystems . Results were normalized to (cid:3) 2 - microglobulin . Relative gene expression was calculated by the (cid:10)(cid:10) C T method ( Applied Biosystems ) . siRNA Transfection Control siRNA , CamK II (cid:3) siRNA , and CamK II (cid:4) siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Silencing of CamK genes was done using Xfect siRNA transfection reagent ( Clontech Labora - tories ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were cultured in a six - well plate until they were 90 % conﬂuent . Next , 30 pmol ( 3 (cid:7) l ) siRNAs were diluted in 47 (cid:7) l Xfect reaction buffer and mixed with 50 (cid:7) l Xfect transfection polymer ( 4 (cid:7) l Xfect Transfection polymer and 46 (cid:7) l Xfect reaction buffer ) to form transfection complex for 20 min at room temperature . These transfection complexes were then added to the cell culture media and the cells were incubated at 37°C in a CO 2 incubator for further 24 – 48 h . Data Analysis Data are reported as means (cid:6) SE ; n refers to the number of cells studied , taken from more than 3 independent batches of cells ( donors ) . Statistical comparisons were made using Student’s t - test or one - way ANOVA , as appropriate ; P (cid:5) 0 . 05 was considered statistically sig - niﬁcant . RESULTS Are Ca 2 (cid:2) Waves Sufﬁcient To Modulate Extracellular Matrix Gene Expressions ? In our previous studies ( 29 , 30 ) we have shown that TGF (cid:3) and PDGF induce rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients in normal human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts , and that interfering with those Ca 2 (cid:2) transients substantially reduces growth factor - induced expres - sion of ECM proteins . While this suggests an important role for rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients in gene expression in these cells , it is unclear whether Ca 2 (cid:2) alone is sufﬁcient to drive gene tran - scription . To answer this question , we incubated cells in Ca 2 (cid:2) - free medium where Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses were applied at regular intervals ( every 60 , 100 , 120 or 200 s ) without addition of any TGF (cid:3) . We found that the expression of collagen A1 or ﬁ - bronectin 1 was increased at all Ca 2 (cid:2) pulse rates , although this was statistically signiﬁcant only at pulse rates of one pulse every 60 s or 100 s ( Fig . 1C ) . This result suggests that rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients alone are sufﬁcient to modulate ECM gene expression in pulmonary ﬁbroblasts . Role of Ca 2 (cid:2) in Other Tgf (cid:2) - Mediated Signaling Pathways After conﬁrming that rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients are necessary ( 30 ) and sufﬁcient ( Fig . 1 ) to modulate ECM gene expression in human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts , we went on to explore whether they regulate ECM gene expression by modulating any of the other TGF (cid:3) - mediated pathways . We examined the Table 1 .

We found that TGF (cid:3) signiﬁcantly increased the phosphorylation levels of Smad 2 / 3 and AKT , but that neither ryanodine nor CPA had any effect on that phosphorylation ( Fig . 2 ) . Levels of phosphorylated ERK were not signiﬁcantly increased after TGF (cid:3) treatment , but neither were they de - creased by CPA or ryanodine ( Fig . 2 ) . These results suggest that TGF (cid:3) - mediated Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling does not act upstream of Smad , AKT , or MAPK pathways . Involvement of CamK II Pathway in TGF (cid:2) - Mediated ECM Gene Expression In other cell types , repetitive Ca 2 (cid:2) oscillations are decoded by CamK II ( 40 , 42 , 43 ) . To determine whether the same was true for human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts , we measured the level of phosphorylation of CamK II protein at Thr 286 / 287 ( resulting in its activation ) under various experimental conditions . Phos - phorylation at Thr 286 / 287 was increased by TGF (cid:3) , and this was signiﬁcantly abrogated by CPA and ryanodine , or by inhibiting calmodulin ( triﬂuoperazine ; 10 (cid:7) M ) or CamK II ( KN93 ; 30 (cid:7) M ) ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . These results suggest that TGF (cid:3) activates CamK II . To conﬁrm that activation of CamK II was also necessary for expression of matrix proteins , we examined whether KN93 ( 30 (cid:7) M ) had any effect on TGF (cid:3) - mediated ECM gene expression . We found that TGF (cid:3) - mediated overexpression of collagen A1 and genes were signiﬁcantly reduced by the treatment of KN93 ( Fig . 3 C ) . Altogether these results conﬁrm the involvement of CamK II in TGF (cid:3) - triggered Ca 2 (cid:2) - mediated ECM gene expression in human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts . We examined the level of phosphorylated CamK II protein after different times of TGF (cid:3) treatment . We found that 5 – 10 min treatment is sufﬁcient to increase the level of phosphory - lated CamK II protein , and that this phosphorylation was still well above baseline at 120 min ( Fig . 4 A ) . We also explored the effects of CamK II signaling on other TGF (cid:3) - induced path - ways . The cells were pretreated with either vehicle or blockers of CamK II ( 30 (cid:7) M KN93 or 10 (cid:7) M triﬂuoperazine ) for 5 h , before overnight TGF (cid:3) treatment . We found a signiﬁcant increase in phosphorylation of Smad without any statistically signiﬁcant change in ERK phosphorylation . In another set of cells also treated with either vehicle or blockers of CamK II , for 5 h and TGF (cid:3) was added for only 10 min : we found a signiﬁcant increase in p - Smad and p - AKT but no change in p - ERK protein . More importantly , we found no statistically Fig . 2 . Disrupting the internal Ca 2 (cid:2) store using ryanodine or cyclopiazonic acid ( both 10 (cid:7) M ; applied before overnight stimulation with 1 nM TGF (cid:3) ) had no effect on TGF (cid:3) - induced phosphorylation of Smad2 / 3 , AKT , or ERK proteins .

These results suggest again that rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transient - mediated signaling , exerted through CamK II , is not directed upstream of the Smad , ERK , or AKT signaling pathways . Isoforms of CamK II involved After conﬁrming the involvement of CamK II , we examined which isoforms of CamK II are present in our system . RT - PCR analysis of CamK II expression showed overexpression of CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) isoforms by TGF (cid:3) treatment , but not CamK II (cid:11) or CamK II (cid:12) ( Fig . 5 Ai ) . To check whether artiﬁcially generated Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses are sufﬁcient to upregulate the expression of CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) gene in absence of TGF (cid:3) , we measured CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) levels in control cell and in cells subjected to fast Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses ( 1 / 100 s ) . We found that these Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses were sufﬁcient to overexpress CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) gene by themselves ( Fig . 5 Aii ) . To examine the role of CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) isoforms in TGF (cid:3) - mediated ECM gene expression , we silenced CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) gene using correspond - ing siRNAs . To conﬁrm the effectiveness of CamK II knock - down , we measured expression levels of CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) mRNA , as well as their corresponding protein levels ( Fig . 5 B ) . We found that CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) siRNA treatment reduced the expression level of both mRNA and protein . Most importantly , we found that both CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) siRNA reduced TGF (cid:3) - mediated overexpression of collagen A1 and genes ( Fig . 6 A ) and ﬁbronectin protein ( Fig . 6 B ) . These results conﬁrmed the involvement of CamK II (cid:3) and CamK II (cid:4) in TGF (cid:3) - mediated ECM gene expression in human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts . DISCUSSION We have previously shown that the growth factors TGF (cid:3) and PDGF evoke rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients in human pulmo - nary ﬁbroblasts and that disrupting these Ca 2 (cid:2) transients in - terferes with the growth factor - stimulated synthetic ability of ﬁbroblasts ( 18 , 29 , 30 ) . Here we elucidate the signaling path - way underlying the Ca 2 (cid:2) dependence of ECM gene expression in these cells . In particular , we show that the TGF (cid:3) - induced Ca 2 (cid:2) transients activate CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) , which in turn induce expression of collagen and ﬁbronectin genes through a pathway that is not upstream of Smad , ERK , or AKT . It has long been known that growth factors stimulate canon - ical signaling pathways including Smad ( 34 ) , MAPK ( 10 , 12 , 14 , 37 ) , PKC ( 37 ) , (cid:3) - catenin ( 15 ) , and PI3K ( 14 ) . Recently , we showed that Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling also plays a role in regulating the full synthetic capacity of ﬁbroblasts : elimination of the Ca 2 (cid:2) transients led to a substantial ( but not complete ) reduction in Fig . 3 . A : representative Western blot image showing phosphorylation of CamK II at Thr 286 / 287 ( resulting in its activation ) under various experimental conditions . Phosphorylation was increased by 1 nM TGF (cid:3) ( overnight treatment ) . Activation was greatly decreased by depleting the internal Ca 2 (cid:2) store ( using ryanodine , CPA ) , or inhibiting calmodulin ( triﬂuoperazine ) or CamK II ( KN93 ) . Scatterplots ( B ) indicate mean (cid:6) SE levels of phosphorylated CamK II / total CamK II after different treatment . C : ﬁbroblasts were pretreated for 4 h with the CamK II inhibitor KN93 ( 30 (cid:7) M ) or vehicle , then stimulated overnight ( 18 h ) with 1 nM TGF (cid:3) in the continued presence of KN93 or vehicle . The next day , cells were lysed and RT - PCR performed to quantify mRNA for collagen 1 and ﬁbronectin ( expressed as a fraction of (cid:3) 2 - microglobulin mRNA ) . KN93 signiﬁcantly suppressed TGF (cid:3) - induced expression of collagen and ﬁbronectin gene . * P (cid:5) 0 . 05 , * * P (cid:5) 0 . 005 , * * * P (cid:5) 0 . 0005 .

However , it was not clear whether changes in [ Ca 2 (cid:2) ] alone are sufﬁcient to alter ECM gene expression . In our present study , we examined whether artiﬁ - cially created rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients in the absence of growth factor receptor stimulation might stimulate gene tran - scription . Cells were bathed continuously in a nominally Ca 2 (cid:2) - free buffer , which not only abrogates internally generated Ca 2 (cid:2) transients immediately ( 29 , 30 ) but over the long term also opens plasmalemmal Ca 2 (cid:2) channels whose function it is to reﬁll the Ca 2 (cid:2) store . Under those conditions , short pulses of external Ca 2 (cid:2) will produce transient elevations of [ Ca 2 (cid:2) ] in the cytosol , which mimic rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients . We found that repeated pulses at rates of 1 and 0 . 6 pulses per minute , in the absence of exogenously added growth factor , tripled the expression of collagen and increased that of ﬁ - bronectin ~ 2 . 5 times ; this closely mirrors the response to an EC 50 concentration of TGF (cid:3) or of PDGF , which we previously showed ( 29 , 30 ) evokes rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients with a frequency of 0 . 6 - 1 oscillations per minute , and increases ex - pression of those two proteins three - to fourfold . In fact , in those previous studies , we demonstrated a sigmoidal relation - ship between growth factor concentration and the frequency of Ca 2 (cid:2) transients . That is , cells at rest or stimulated with low threshold concentrations of growth factor exhibited less than 0 . 2 oscillations per minute , whereas those stimulated with 100 - fold higher concentrations of growth factor ( still within the physiologically relevant range and sufﬁcient to evoke full synthetic activity ) exhibited oscillation frequencies of ~ 1 . 1 per minute . Moreover , disruption of Ca 2 (cid:2) handling using CPA or ryanodine reduced rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients frequencies back down to ~ 0 . 2 per minute and substantially reduced ECM protein production . The fact that synthetic activity was not completely eliminated suggests an additive or synergistic in - teraction between the Ca 2 (cid:2) transients and the canonical sig - naling pathways . In the present study , disruption of Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling had no effect on phosphorylation of Smad , ERK , or AKT proteins , suggesting that any such interactions do not occur upstream of the phosphorylation signaling events . We do not believe that the effect of the Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses is actually secondary to pulsatile changes in pressure or ﬂow , which can lead to secretory release of ATP . First , the apparatus we designed is open to the atmosphere and the ﬂuid level is kept constant using suction , so those changes in ﬂuid dynamics are avoided . Second , the continuous ﬂow would not account for the frequency dependence of these pulses . Third , if the ﬂow were inducing ATP release followed by activation of the cells Fig . 4 .

Finally , we have already pointed out that the continuous superfusion with nominally Ca 2 (cid:2) - free medium is intended to deplete the internal Ca 2 (cid:2) stores ( see METHODS AND MATERIALS ) , which we have previously shown obviates any potential effect of ATP on ECM expression in these cells ( 17 ) . Studies have shown that frequency of Ca 2 (cid:2) waves is the main regulatory factor of Ca 2 (cid:2) - mediated gene expression ( 8 , 9 , 25 , 41 ) . For example , Dolmetsch et al . ( 8 , 9 ) showed , in one landmark study in T cells , that rapid oscillations stimulated one set of transcription factors ( NFAT and Oct / OAP ) to express IL - 2 , whereas slow oscillations activated a different one ( NF (cid:13) B ) to express IL - 8 . We have previously explained how different Ca 2 (cid:2) transient frequencies might differentially regu - late one enzyme or transcription factor over another ( 19 ) . Accordingly , in our present study , while slow Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses ( 2 – 3 pulses per 10 min ) were not sufﬁcient to drive signiﬁcant ECM gene expression , they might stimulate overexpression of an - other set of genes . We hypothesize that TGF (cid:3) uses one range of Ca 2 (cid:2) transient frequencies to stimulate a ﬁbroblast to express ECM proteins , but another range of frequencies to stimulate expression of smooth muscle actin and cause ﬁbro - blast - myoﬁbroblast transformation . Altogether this artiﬁcial Ca 2 (cid:2) pulse experiment demonstrates that rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) tran - sients are sufﬁcient to alter ECM gene expression . In our previous studies , we found that complete obliteration of the Ca 2 (cid:2) transients by ryanodine or CPA signiﬁcantly reduced the level of TGF (cid:3) - mediated expression of ECM genes but the latter was still elevated above baseline ( 30 ) . This fact indicates that the Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling has an additive or synergistic effect with other signaling pathways triggered by TGF (cid:3) . In our present study , we did not observe any changes in the TGF (cid:3) - mediated phosphorylation of Smad 2 / 3 protein levels after treatment with interventions that abolish Ca 2 (cid:2) transient activ - ity . As such , any interaction that may occur between the Ca 2 (cid:2) - signaling and Smad - signaling pathways would likely reside downstream of Smad protein phosphorylation . TGF (cid:3) can exert effects via modulating AKT pathways in ﬁbroblasts ( 20 , 23 ) , and it has been shown that Ca 2 (cid:2) can trigger phosphorylation of AKT protein ( 48 ) . In our hands , there was no change in TGF (cid:3) - induced level of phosphorylated AKT after disrupting Ca 2 (cid:2) transients , which indicates that TGF (cid:3) - mediated Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling does not interfere with PI3K signaling upstream of AKT protein . The ERK - MAP kinase pathway is also involved in TGF (cid:3) signaling in some cells but not all ( 16 ) . Lee et al . ( 24 ) had shown that TGF (cid:3) activates the ERK - MAP kinase pathway in 3T3 Swiss mouse ﬁbroblasts via phosphorylation of ShcA protein . There are few studies showing the involvement of Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling in modulation of ERK pathway ( 39 ) . Schmitt et al . ( 39 ) showed the involvement of CamK I in Ca 2 (cid:2) - mediated ERK activation . In another study , Sandoval et al . ( 38 ) showed Fig . 5 . Ca 2 (cid:2) oscillation frequency in our human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts seems to be transduced , at least in part , by CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) . Ai : total RNA was extracted from human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts , and mRNA transcripts of CamK II (cid:11) , II (cid:3) , II (cid:12) and II (cid:4) were determined by RT - PCR from the isolated RNA . GAPDH was used as loading control . CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) were induced by TGF (cid:3) ( 1 nM ) , but not II (cid:11) or II (cid:12) in our cells . ii : Repetitive Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses ( 1 pulse / 100 s ) upregulated the expression level of CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) mRNA . Figures are representative images of 3 different groups , and each experiment was repeated at least 3 times . Adequacy of CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) knockdown were checked by measuring the mRNA ( B , i and ii ) and protein levels ( Biii ) of CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) , both mRNA and protein levels of CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) were reduced after corresponding siRNA treatment .

L516 ROLE OF CAMK II PATHWAY IN TGF (cid:3) - MEDIATED MATRIX GENE EXPRESSION AJP - Lung Cell Mol Physiol • doi : 10 . 1152 / ajplung . 00084 . 2016 • www . ajplung . org that platelet - activating factor ( PAF ) - mediated phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 in bovine neutrophils was signiﬁcantly reduced by chelation of Ca 2 (cid:2) from the medium . We did not see any signiﬁcant changes in phospho - ERK 1 / 2 levels in our cells following stimulation with TGF (cid:3) with or without blockers of Ca 2 (cid:2) handling , making it unlikely that the Ca 2 (cid:2) transients act on / through these pathways . The CamK pathway is another TGF (cid:3) - mediated pathway that can regulate gene expression . CamK II phosphorylates I (cid:13) B and triggers the release of NF (cid:13) B , which in turn translocates to the nucleus and promotes gene transcription ( 36 ) . Calcineurin , a serine / threonine phosphatase , is another well - recognized cal - modulin effector . Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT and triggers its translocation into the nucleus . Nuclear NFAT then regulates gene transcription ( 6 , 8 ) . There is a long and growing list of other transcriptional factors that are either activated or suppressed by one or another CamK subtype ( 13 , 17 , 21 , 31 , 33 ) . CamK II phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad4 and blocks nuclear accumulation of Smad2 , thus inhibiting TGF (cid:3) - depen - dent transcriptional responses in HEK - 293 and Cos - 1 cells ( 45 ) . Calmodulin can also interact directly with Smad proteins in a Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent manner ( 45 , 50 ) . In our present study , we found that TGF (cid:3) - mediated phosphorylation of CamK II was signiﬁcantly reduced after disrupting Ca 2 (cid:2) transients ( CPA , ryanodine ) or inhibiting CamK II - signaling ( KN93 and triﬂu - operazine ) . No interactions were found between the CamK II pathway and other canonical TGF (cid:3) - mediated pathways , as we didn’t see any changes in TGF (cid:3) - mediated phosphorylation of Smad 2 / 3 , AKT , or ERK1 / 2 after treatment with blockers of the CamK II pathway ( KN93 and triﬂuoperazine ) . We also identiﬁed the presence of CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) , but not II (cid:11) or II (cid:12) , in TGF (cid:3) - treated ﬁbroblasts . Interestingly , we found that Ca 2 (cid:2) pulses ( 1 / 100 s ) are sufﬁcient to overexpress CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) gene in the absence of external growth factor . This result suggests that rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients are sufﬁcient for triggering the CamK II pathway . Most importantly , we also found signiﬁcant reduction in TGF (cid:3) – induced ECM gene ex - pression after inhibiting CamK activity pharmacologically ( us - ing KN93 ) or silencing the expression of CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) . These results conﬁrm that the frequency of rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) transients in our human pulmonary ﬁbroblasts seems to be transduced , at least in part , by CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) . Collectively , these data describe a novel , noncanonical sig - naling mechanism in pulmonary ﬁbroblasts . TGF (cid:3) evokes rhythmic Ca 2 (cid:2) oscillations , which in turn activate CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) , leading to ECM gene expression and proﬁbrotic responses in the absence of other kinase - mediated signaling events ( e . g . , those carried by Smad , ERK , AKT , or PI3K ) . The Fig . 6 . TGF (cid:3) – induced ( 1 nM ) ECM gene expression ( A ) and ﬁbronectin protein expression ( B ) was reduced after silencing CamK II (cid:3) and II (cid:4) genes .

Fibroblasts and myoﬁbroblasts are prime targets in ﬁbrosis , regardless of the affected organ , and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been widely pursued as a means to inhibiting the actions of growth factors . However , tyrosine kinase inhibitors have potential problems related to target speciﬁcity and drug resistance , which provides an excellent rationale to explore other targetable pathways that could be developed in addition to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . In our previous study we have shown that nifedipine , a commonly used L - type Ca 2 (cid:2) channel blocker , can inhibit the progression of bleomycin - induced lung ﬁbrosis in mice ( 28 ) . The develop - ment of novel CamK inhibitors or other modulators of Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling and Ca 2 (cid:2) wave decoding represent a completely new approach for the treatment of ﬁbrosis .
