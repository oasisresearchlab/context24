Introduction 3 Creativity has been studied from the diverse perspectives of business , cognitive science , 4 philosophy , psychology , and art , among others ( Hennessey & Amabile , 2010 ) . Creativity’s 5 multi - dimensional nature , which encompasses individual traits and behaviors as well as the 6 interaction between creative individuals , their ideas , and society , makes it difficult to define and 7 capture the phenomenon ( Runco , 2004 ) . According to creativity experts , human creative 8 potential is a virtually limitless resource that defies racial , social , economic , and gender 9 categorization ( “Engineering Research…” 2006 ; Florida , 2002 ) . Creativity can be cultivated , 10 developed , and practiced ( Michalko , 2006 ) . The suggested ways in which to increase creativity 11 vary , however . Popular press titles include strategies such as journaling , daily artistic and 12 reflective activities , games , and heeding intuitive beliefs and feelings ( Maisel , 2000 ; Makridakis , 13 2013 ; von Oech , 2003 ) . 14 In the global and highly competitive fashion industry creativity is very important . 15 According to Jennings ( 2011 ) , “creativity is the backbone of fashion design” ( p . 13 ) . Other 16 researchers argue that regardless of the primary job focus , from creative design to sales to 17 museum work , creativity , and especially creative problem solving , is essential in the fashion 18 business ( Karpova , Marcketti , & Barker , 2011 ) . Despite its importance , there have been a limited 19 number of studies on creativity within the fashion field . Danielson ( 1986 ) surveyed fifty - five 20 contemporary fashion illustrators to provide insight into their creative processes to enrich 21 classroom teaching on the subject . Eckert and Demeid ( 2001 ) analyzed the ways in which the 22 design process was influenced by differing business models of knitwear companies . The 23 2 researchers examined the ways in which students and professionals used sources for inspiration 24 for knitwear design . A qualitative investigation that focused on British fashion designers 25 advocated for research on innovation in the creative industries ( Malem , 2008 ) . At the 2008 26 Apparel Executive Forum keynote presentation , Patty Devlin of Play , a consulting company , 27 urged designers to “seek a diversity of inspiration” by incorporating different perspectives in the 28 workplace , becoming comfortable with ambiguity , and promoting risk - taking or “passion in 29 action : ” key aspects identified in the literature for enhancing creativity ( Speer , 2008 ) . 30 Professionals in creative industries observe , practice , exchange , adapt , and cultivate 31 creative strategies as part of their daily routines . Documenting , interpreting , and understanding 32 their experiences , views , and insights regarding creativity will help advance our knowledge 33 about this complex and important phenomenon . This study explored fashion industry 34 professionals’ viewpoints on traits of creative people and how creativity can be developed . 35 Educators can utilize the information presented in the study to better understand the creativity 36 phenomenon as experienced by industry insiders and use the strategies mentioned to enhance 37 their students’ creativity . In the same vein , industry practitioners can use the research findings to 38 cultivate their own creativity as well as that of their employees . 39 1 . 1 . Traits of Creative People 40 The research on the relationship between personality and creativity is well established 41 and has grown in popularity ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1996 ; Feist , 1998 ; Furnham & Bachtier , 2008 ; 42 Selby , Shaw , & Houtz , 2005 ) . Many personal characteristics have been associated with creativity 43 ( Selby et al . , 2005 ) . One of the pioneering studies analyzed United States’ Air Force captains , 44 and determined that certain characteristics were correlated with creativity including a preference 45 3 for complexity , independent judgment in a group situation , dominance , and impulsiveness 46 ( Barron , 1955 ) . 47 Building on Barron ( 1955 ) , MacKinnon ( 1962 ) assessed the relationship between 48 creativity and personality in well known , highly creative architects . He supported Barron’s 49 findings by noting a strong correlation between creativity and preference for complexity . Other 50 important characteristics identified included motivation to achieve , flexibility in thought , self - 51 acceptance , and self - confidence . Due to the intense and somewhat arduous nature of creativity , 52 creative individuals must be passionate ( Rentzulli , Koehler , & Fogarty , 2006 ; Selby et al . , 2005 ) . 53 This passion provides the much needed discipline , motivation , and focused energy needed in 54 creativity ( Rentzulli et al . , 2006 ; Amabile ; 1989 ) . Numerous other studies reported various traits 55 associated with creativity . These included divergent thinking , openness , and preference for 56 challenge ( Amabile , 1989 ; Furnham & Bachtiar , 2008 ; Renzulli , Sytsma , & Berman , 2000 ) . 57 Researchers have argued that creativity requires steps beyond cognition . Sternberg 58 ( 1985 ; 2006 ) concluded that creative thinking was comprised of three skills : ( a ) seeing problems 59 outside of conventional boundaries , ( b ) differentiating between ideas worth pursuing and those 60 that were not , and ( c ) marketing one’s ideas to others . Lubart and Sternberg ( 1997 ) established a 61 correlation between taking risks and being creative . However , they suggested this correlation 62 was present only in specific domains . For example , the correlation between taking risks and 63 levels of creativity was significant among artists , but not fiction writers . Despite many efforts 64 devoted to determining which traits can serve as predictors of creativity , there has been little 65 agreement on creative personal characteristics . 66 1 . 2 . Developing Creativity 67 4 Since the 1990s , there has been increased interest in creativity training ( Mumford , 2003 ) . 68 Various strategies for creativity development have been proposed and tested ( Bull , Montgomery , 69 & Baloche , 1995 ; Selby et al . , 2005 ; Sternberg , 2006 ) . Torrance ( 1987 ) , in a two - part study , 70 evaluated the effectiveness of the strategies : ( 1 ) Osborn - Parnes Creative Problem Solving 71 program which included brainstorming and productive thinking , divergent thinking strategies , 72 questioning assumptions , and creative problem solving techniques ; ( 2 ) interdisciplinary 73 approaches ; ( 3 ) use of packaged materials ( e . g . , those by Purdue Creativity Program ) ; ( 4 ) use of 74 media and reading to practice skills ; ( 5 ) emphasis on practice through artistic endeavors ; ( 6 ) 75 favorable learning environment ; and ( 7 ) external motivation ( e . g . , rewards ) . Part one of his study 76 analyzed 143 studies of creativity training courses used with children from kindergarten through 77 grade 12 . The most effective strategies included the Osborn - Parnes program and interdisciplinary 78 approaches . The least effective strategy was an attempt to create an ideal learning environment . 79 Part two of the study analyzed a total of 242 studies : 166 at the elementary and secondary levels 80 and 76 at the college / adult level . When applying divergent thinking to real life scenarios , such as 81 developing and evaluating new products , the college / adult level students had a much higher 82 success rate than grade school students . Torrance ( 1987 ) concluded that training and practice in 83 real - life problem solving improved creativity . 84 More recently , Bull et al . ( 1995 ) explored formal creativity training from an educational 85 perspective . After reviewing 67 creativity course syllabi , the authors surveyed 103 creativity 86 instructors and asked them to identify the importance of course criteria . The instructors 87 responded that general theories and models were of very little importance ; rather , they 88 emphasized using humor , imagination , analogy / metaphor , and increasing student understanding 89 of creativity . One of the highest ranked criteria was having a safe environment where students 90 5 felt secure and free to explore their creativity . Other highly ranked criteria included eliminating 91 creativity blocks and creating a climate that fostered creativity . 92 Scott , Leritz , and Mumford ( 2004 ) outlined six methods for developing creativity : ( 1 ) 93 changing or improving the environment ; ( 2 ) motivating through incentives ; ( 3 ) building 94 expertise ; ( 4 ) enhancing career development experiences ; ( 5 ) facilitating group work and 95 interaction ; and ( 6 ) training and education , which was the most favored . The most successful 96 training programs focused the development of training content on the core practices of 97 opportunity recognition , idea generation , and idea evaluation ( Scott et al . , 2004 ) . 98 Cropley ( 1997 ) and Nickerson ( 1999 ) disagreed on the length of time needed to develop 99 creativity . Cropley insisted that creativity could not be developed through short term 100 intervention . His strategy for teaching creativity relied on five principles : ( 1 ) building skills ; ( 2 ) 101 practicing these skills through exercises ; ( 3 ) encouraging novelty ; ( 4 ) evaluating students’ 102 progress and errors openly ; and ( 5 ) giving a mixture of group and individual assignments . The 103 author stressed that students needed to learn and practice creative thinking skills over time . 104 Nickerson ( 1999 ) agreed that practice was necessary , but held that short term interventions were 105 successful when they focused on honing specific skills . Those skills could then be practiced 106 throughout a lifetime . 107 Scholars suggest that there are varying levels of creativity . Selby et al . ( 2005 ) identified 108 four levels of creativity : ( 1 ) not yet evident ; ( 2 ) emerging ; ( 3 ) expressing ; and ( 4 ) excelling . 109 Similarly , Sternberg ( 2006 ) highlighted different types of creativity from “minor replications to 110 major redefinitions” ( p . 95 ) . Sternberg’s studies of elementary , middle school , and high school 111 participants , suggested that students performed better when instruction was tailored to each 112 6 child’s ability level . It was noted that in order to be effective educators , instructors must 113 understand their own creativity ( Selby et al . , 2005 ; Sternberg 2006 ) . 114 Identifying creative traits and nurturing them in students and young professionals today is 115 more important than ever ( Florida , 2002 ) . A National Science Foundation’s report urged that 116 creative individuals within all disciplines will be central for continued U . S . prosperity and 117 security in the 21 st century ( “Engineering Research…” 2006 ) . Recently , however , research 118 indicates that for the first time in decades , American creativity is declining ( Bronson & 119 Merryman , 2010 ) . 120 2 . Method 121 To explore fashion industry professionals’ views on traits of creative people and how 122 creativity can be nurtured in individuals , a qualitative methodology was used to obtain “rich” or 123 “thick” data ( Esterberg , 2002 ) . This approach allowed participants to talk about the topic in their 124 own words and describe their everyday experiences , ideas , and opinions ( van Manen , 1990 ) . To 125 address the purpose of the study , the authors developed an interview protocol consisting of open 126 ended questions . Following the interview protocol ensured a systematic approach to data 127 collection ( Kvale , 1996 ) . Participants were asked to talk about their professional preparation and 128 career path in the industry . Questions regarding traits of creative individuals and how creativity 129 could be developed and strategies for that purpose were also asked . Examples of questions from 130 the interview protocol included : “Please describe positions / jobs in your company that require 131 creative people ? Could you give examples ? ” , “What characteristics do these creative people 132 have ? ” , “Do you think creativity can be developed ? Do you think it can be taught ? Why ? How 133 can it be fostered ? ” Probing questions were used to encourage participants to provide additional 134 information . Prior the interview , each participant was informed that ( 1 ) the researchers were 135 7 interested in their personal opinions and viewpoints and ( 2 ) her / his responses and identities 136 would remain confidential , in that quotes and research results would not be linked to their or 137 their companies’ names . 138 The research was approved by the institutional review board of a land - grant Midwestern 139 University . A purposive , snowball sampling strategy was used to recruit research participants 140 and ensure collection of relevant data ( Esterberg , 2002 ) . The authors contacted graduates of their 141 apparel program and invited them to participate in the study . The program has both design and 142 merchandising specializations , and both are in the top twenty fashion design and fashion 143 merchandising programs in the USA , according to the 2013 Fashion Schools’ rating ( 2013a ; 144 2013b ) . The program awards Bachelor of Science , Master of Science , and Doctor of Philosophy 145 degrees and has a total of 500 + students . At the end of the interview , each participant was asked 146 to recommend other industry professionals to invite to participate in the research . Individual , 147 semi - structured interviews were utilized to collect the data . Each participant received the 148 interview protocol in advance so that they had a chance to review the questions prior to the 149 interview . With participants’ consent , all interviews were audio taped . The length of the 150 interviews ranged from one to two hours . All interviews were transcribed to facilitate data 151 analysis . 152 A phenomenological interpretive approach was used to analyze the data . First , interview 153 transcripts were analyzed by the researchers individually through an iterative part - to - whole 154 process ( McCracken , 1988 ) . The analyses and interpretation resulted in the emergence of 155 significant themes that described participants’ experiences and perceptions related to creative 156 people and creativity development ( van Manen , 1990 ) . Next , the researchers worked together to 157 compare , discuss , and finalize emergent themes into a consistent whole utilizing a back - and - 158 8 forth , part - to - whole process of interpretation ( Spiggle , 1994 ) . The data analysis process revealed 159 saturation , in which concepts became redundant , i . e . , thoroughly explained and reiterated by the 160 interview participants ( Corbin & Strauss , 2008 ) . Thus , the researchers’ stopped collecting data . 161 The final themes were shared with the apparel program’s industry advisory board members , who 162 had no objections , nor further suggestions regarding the research results . 163 2 . 1 . Participants 164 Twenty - eight fashion industry professionals were interviewed . Professionals came from 165 diverse company backgrounds , positions , regions of the country , and with a range of 2 to 30 166 years of experience in the industry . Half of the participants had been working in the industry 167 between 5 and 9 years . One quarter of the participants had been in the industry between 10 and 168 20 years , and another seven professionals had been working in the industry for between 21 and 169 30 years . Twenty out of the total 28 participants graduated from the apparel program with which 170 the researchers are associated . These participants graduated from the program between 2 to 25 171 years ago . Professionals represented small , medium , and large size firms located throughout the 172 United States . Half of the participants were from the Northeast region ( New York City ) that is 173 considered the center of the U . S . fashion industry ( Rantisi , 2002 ) . Ten professionals were from 174 the Midwestern region , where the apparel program is located . The rest of the participants were 175 from the South or Southwestern region . 176 In this study , industry was defined as a cluster of related businesses , including 177 manufacturing , distribution , auxiliary , research / consultant and educational institutions ( Rantisi , 178 2002 ; Scott , 2006 ) . We strived to recruit participants who represented a wide range of companies 179 and jobs / positions within the industry . Companies in the study were from mass market and 180 specialty retailers to manufacturers and apparel import intermediaries to designer’s houses and 181 9 educational institutions . All companies were involved in some part of the apparel supply chain 182 from product design and development , production , distribution , wholesale , and retail . In terms of 183 jobs , participants represented both design and business sides of the industry . For example , five 184 participants were lead or associate designers and two were product development managers . Four 185 had a position of vice president ( VP ) of design or creative director / product development director . 186 One participant was VP of merchandising and two were VP of sales . Four professionals were 187 entrepreneurs . Three professionals were educators , all with significant ( 15 + years ) fashion 188 industry experience . 189 Reflecting the gender distribution of most fashion programs , the majority of interviewees 190 were females ; five participants ( 18 % ) were male . Due to stipulations of the companies and as 191 stated in the informed consent document provided to participants , no participant or company 192 names are utilized . Pseudonyms are used throughout the paper . It should be noted that none of 193 the participants received formal creative thinking courses , workshops , seminars , or other 194 training . This was appropriate for our research purpose : to explore fashion industry 195 professionals’ viewpoints on traits of creative people and how creativity can be developed . 196 3 . Results 197 Interpretive analyses of the interviews narrative resulted in eleven major themes . The 198 themes formed three topical areas : ( a ) traits of creative people , ( b ) origins of creativity , and ( c ) 199 strategies for developing creativity . The three topical areas explored fashion industry 200 professionals’ experiences and viewpoints on characteristics of creative people and development 201 of creativity . 202 3 . 1 . Topical Area One : Traits of Creative People 203 10 Participants consistently discussed four traits of creative people . These included : ( a ) 204 different thought processes ; ( b ) determination ; ( c ) having an open mind ; and ( d ) risk taking . 205 3 . 1 . 1 . Different Thought Processes 206 Participants insisted that , based on their experiences , creative people were typically set 207 apart by their different thought processes . As May , a vice president of sales for an apparel 208 manufacturing company , explained , “Creativity to me is thinking of things in a new way . ” One 209 of the often used creative thinking descriptors was the ability to look at a problem from different 210 perspectives : “…looking at something in a different way” ( Lana , chief officer , merchandising ) . 211 Another common response was deriving multiple , rather than just one , possible solutions to a 212 problem . This was perceived as critical to the creative thinking process : “You have to have that 213 mind where you want to think of ten ways to fix it” ( Ella , a designer for a high - end fashion 214 company ) . Participants believed that creative people tended to have multiple and diverse inputs 215 ( perceptions of a problem ) as well as outputs ( ideas or solutions ) that led to evidence of their 216 creativity . 217 3 . 1 . 2 . Determination 218 Another quality of creative people discussed by the participants can be described as 219 “determination . ” Fashion professionals talked about an internal or intrinsic motivation that drove 220 creative people to not give up easily and to have passion and persistence . For example , “You 221 have to have that drive and that passion to want to figure things out and to be creative in that way 222 and to try hard ! ” ( Ella , a designer ) . According to Lynn , a vice president of merchandising , “It 223 takes the willingness , the drive to be able to want to get it done . ” In addition to passion , 224 participants believed that it was critical to have determination and persistence to see ideas 225 realized : “If I put my mind to something , I’ll follow through and do it . Some people are not that 226 11 way . I’m very self - motivated” ( Jess , a designer ) . Another professional agreed : “I don’t take ‘no’ 227 for an answer” ( Lana , a chief officer , merchandising ) . Participants agreed that creative people 228 thrive in a challenging environment . They become bored with a routine and create challenges for 229 themselves . Moreover , they challenge people around them by constantly asking questions and 230 proposing new ideas . As Travis , a vice president of design explained , “You’re challenging 231 everything , every status quo , at every level . I mean , I challenge everyone [ I work with ] . I 232 challenge production people all the time . I’m challenging merchants . I’m challenging 233 factories . ” 234 3 . 1 . 3 . Risk Taking 235 New ideas are often associated with risk . Participants believed that willingness to take 236 risks is a characteristic of creative people : “Taking risks , trying something new , not being afraid 237 of [ the ] unknown” ( Helen , a sales manager ) . This quality was frequently described as “pushing 238 the envelope . ” A certain degree of self - confidence was needed to be willing to expose yourself , 239 along with your ideas , to others’ critiques : “You have to be willing to…just speak up your mind 240 and tell them what you think . That is kind of scary , but much appreciated in the industry because 241 if you have a great idea but you don’t say anything , no one will know” ( Alice , a senior business 242 analyst ) . Another professional stated lack of motivation and fear as a reason people do not take 243 risk . James , a creative director stated : “Why are you willing to risk ? You have a good life . You 244 know , you have everything you need . Why risk everything you have ? ” Clara , a fashion educator , 245 summarized this characteristic , “The creative individuals are those that are not afraid to fail and 246 not afraid to have something to go wrong . …I think to be really creative you have to be willing 247 to take risk . ” 248 3 . 1 . 4 . Having an Open Mind 249 12 Participants noted that having an open mind was an essential trait of creative people . 250 According to Bob , an associate designer , “I think creativity is like welcoming all positions and 251 opinions on things and to not discredit people because their ideas are not the same as yours . So 252 creativity to me is open - mindedness . ” Being open - minded also included characteristics of 253 adaptability and flexibility , “Some people are more flexible and have more open thought process . 254 So , they might do better in creativity” ( Lana , a chief officer , merchandising ) . 255 Even after identifying specific traits and characteristics of creative individuals such as 256 different thinking processes , determination , risk taking , and having an open mind , the creativity 257 phenomenon remained something of a mystery to the participants . One participant expressed his 258 amazement with the wonder of creative thinking : “And they think about something in a 259 completely different way ! I’m…just… ‘How in the hell did he think of that ? ’” ( Travis , a vice 260 president of design ) . It was not easy for the participants to precisely state distinguishing 261 creativity traits . As a result , some participants relied on platitudes to define creativity , such as 262 “thinking outside the box” or “having a fresh eye . ” 263 3 . 2 . Topical Area Two : Origins of Creativity 264 This topical area explored fashion industry professionals’ viewpoints on the origins of 265 creativity—whether it was innate or if it could be acquired and learned . Participants’ opinions on 266 the topic formed three almost equal groups . Slightly more than one - third of the participants 267 believed that everyone can be creative ( 11 professionals ) . This group agreed that creativity is a 268 skill that can be learned , practiced , and mastered . In contrast , slightly less than one - third of the 269 participants viewed creativity as an inborn trait , meaning that some people are born creative 270 while others are not ( 9 professionals ) . The remaining professionals ( 8 participants ) approached 271 the question depending upon how they defined creativity , as either a creative problem - solving 272 13 skill or an artistic talent . This group believed that creative problem - solving skills can be taught 273 much more easily than artistic creativity , which might be impossible for everyone to acquire . It 274 should be noted that all three groups were well represented by artistically talented professionals , 275 i . e . fashion designers , as well as professionals from the business side of the industry including 276 buyers and merchandisers . 277 3 . 2 . 1 . Everyone is Creative 278 Eleven participants believed that all people have a creative potential . Accordingly , they 279 maintained that everyone can be creative through developing the way one thinks and practicing 280 creative thinking strategies : “I think creativity can be taught , to some extent . Some people are 281 more creative than others , but you definitely can learn it . You can learn , you know , to develop 282 your mind” ( Clara , a fashion educator ) . Dave , a freelance designer , agreed , “Yes , it can be 283 taught , to an extent . I think there’s a natural ability to be creative , as well as self - developed , or 284 taught creativity . ” 285 This group of participants believed that everyone who wants to be creative can learn 286 creative thinking skills through work and practice , “It does take a lot of practice and if people are 287 constantly challenged and have to stretch their brain” ( Lana , chief officer , merchandising ) . In 288 addition , motivation and determination were cited as critical to the process of becoming creative ; 289 even if the skills and behaviors might come easier to some individuals then others . According to 290 Kelly , a fashion educator , “You can teach creativity . It’s just harder for some . Some are very 291 visual , and very talented , and it comes very easily to them . And I think you can become a lot 292 better at it . It’s like a piano player . Some people can just sit down and play the piano , and others 293 have to practice . ” 294 3 . 2 . 2 . Not Everyone Is Creative 295 14 Nine participants believed that some people are naturally creative , while others are not . 296 When trying to explain the reasons behind the difference , participants used words such as 297 ‘intuition’ or ‘gut feeling’ . May , a designer , explained this relevant to her creative design 298 domain : “ [ Creativity is ] to have an intuitive sense , to have an intuitive understanding of what is 299 attractive or new . ” She stressed that one can further enhance creativity if he / she had an “innate 300 sense of creativity to begin with . ” Similarly , another professional maintained that creativity was 301 an innate trait , “You either have it , or you don’t , in a sense . You can teach people to use 302 resources that are out there to get ideas . But you have to have some of it just ingrained in you” 303 ( Alice , a senior business analyst ) . In the same vein , Helen , a sales manager for a designer’s 304 house , offered another explanation : “I think you either have it , or you don’t . It’s not a formula . It 305 comes from your gut . ” 306 These participants agreed that creativity could be developed , or enhanced in people who 307 are born creative . Consequently , they maintained creativity cannot be taught to people who were 308 born uncreative . As Sandy , a lead designer , noted , “I do think that , unfortunately , some people 309 are really not creative . Their minds just don’t really work that way . I’m not sure if you can truly 310 teach creativity . You definitely can develop it [ if you have it ] . ” Travis , a vice president of design , 311 went further and divided all people into three groups in terms of creative potential and 312 manifestation , “There’re some people who get it very quickly . There’re some who have it , and 313 they don’t realize they have it , and they have to tap into it and figure out how to dust off all 314 roadblocks that they have . And then there’re some people that just can’t do it . It’s just not in 315 their DNA . It’s not something that they can do . ” This group maintained that people naturally had 316 different potential in creativity , “I think some people will never be creative because they just 317 15 can’t be . In the same way some people can’t think logically , or can’t process something that’s 318 happening that’s not supposed to happen” ( Tracy , a textile designer ) . 319 3 . 2 . 3 . Problem Solving versus Artistic Creativity 320 Finally , eight professionals distinguished between creative problem solving and artistic 321 creativity . Consequently , this determined the group’s view on teaching creativity , “Can creativity 322 be taught ? It depends on what type of creativity . There are different types of creativity . There’s 323 problem solving , and there’s design” ( Amber , an associate designer ) . Like Natalie , an apparel 324 store owner , these participants believed that not everyone can learn artistic creativity but problem 325 solving skills could be taught to anyone , “Yes , you can teach creativity , and it may not apply to 326 the creativity in the artistic aspect , but the entrepreneurial thinking , the problem solving type of 327 creativity . ” 328 These participants agreed that everyone is capable of learning and applying creative 329 problem solving strategies , “You can teach problem solving skills . Everybody can be shown that 330 there are different options and different way of thinking through things” ( Lana , chief officer , 331 merchandising ) . However , these professionals also believed that artistic creativity required a 332 preexisting potential , and while everyone can take art lessons , the outcomes depended upon the 333 student’s innate talent : 334 I think certain level of design creativity can be taught . After a while , you can learn the 335 taste level . But there’s only a certain level . I think , only certain people can be designers . 336 Either you’ve got it , or you don’t . ( Amber , an associate designer ) 337 Not everybody has that aesthetic or creative eye . I think everybody can think creatively if 338 you train them , but I’m not sure that everybody has that eye to just put things together : 339 16 color , balance , etc . And I think , probably , some of the aesthetic creativity can be taught , 340 although some of it seems to be innate to me . ( Clara , a fashion educator ) 341 3 . 3 . Topical Area Three : Strategies for Developing Creativity 342 Participants discussed various ways and approaches to enhancing creativity . They formed 343 four themes , or strategies for developing creativity : ( a ) formal training ; ( b ) practicing creative 344 thinking ; ( c ) exposure to the world ; and ( d ) safe , yet challenging environment . 345 3 . 3 . 1 . Formal Training 346 Some participants agreed that creativity could be developed through formal training such 347 as courses or workshops which did not have to be related to one’s profession or college major . 348 For example , Don , a vice president of sales , advocated for art courses for developing creativity , 349 “Definitely through art classes , you know , such as drawing , painting , even music . Something that 350 isn’t related to the field you are in . ” Elizabeth , an associate designer , noted a creative fashion 351 design course she took in college helped increase her creativity “I thought that class was really 352 cool . It definitely made me think outside the box . ” Beyond college courses , formal training 353 might include short workshops or seminars offered on - site by employer or at professional 354 meetings . Amber , an associate designer , explained , “ [ At work ] , we have different seminars and 355 workshops all the time , where you can go and learn things . ” 356 3 . 3 . 2 . Practicing Creative Thinking 357 Professionals commented that creativity could be enhanced by learning and practicing 358 creative thinking . One of the suggested strategies was dissecting a problem and breaking it down 359 into achievable parts . As James , a creative director , explained , “Once you get a problem , you 360 look at it and then you dissect it . You kind of slice it up and you figure out , “Ok , this is the one 361 thing I can tackle . ” As opposed to most people [ who ] see the whole thing and say , “I don’t know 362 17 what to do ! ” They freak out and walk away . So , what I do is I look at the problem and I break it 363 down into steps . This is a creative process . ” Kelly , a fashion educator , agreed , “The problem 364 actually might not be the most visible thing . The problem might be something that’s hidden 365 behind another situation . This ability to dissect a problem , figure out what’s important , and then 366 find the solution that meets the needs . That’s where the creativity comes in . ” Another strategy 367 for approaching a problem was to look at it from different perspectives , which might lead to 368 unique and original solutions . Sandy , a lead designer , suggested , “Just working your mind 369 around a problem from lots and lots of different angles is really the way to do it . ” 370 Participants agreed that coming up with multiple answers , or solutions , to a problem was 371 critical for creative outcomes . Lana , a chief merchandising officer , believed that students can 372 develop the skill of seeing different answers over time , as a result of practice : “Tell students to 373 sketch twelve blouses , all with different collars and different sleeves . They are probably going to 374 come up with the first six or seven pretty easily and the last five , it’s going to be like : “Ugh ! ” 375 Then next week it could be : Come up with twelve different high - heeled shoes . The more you do 376 it , the easier it gets since you’re able to stretch your mind and think of different things . ” Kyla , a 377 director of product development , commented that while there are many ways to stimulate 378 creativity , it was important “…to foster an environment of thinking of things in a new way and 379 looking at different vehicles , always looking for options . ” Amber , an associate designer , 380 summarized creative thinking strategies as follows , “It is not to look at black and white . It is 381 getting people to look outside the box . Don’t just come up with a straight answer . There are 382 multiple answers to whatever the question is . ” 383 3 . 3 . 3 . Exposure to the World 384 18 It was mentioned that various cultural , artistic , and other types of activities and events , 385 including travel , were critical for creativity development . These experiences could expand one’s 386 knowledge and skills , help to develop characteristics of creative people , and be a source of 387 inspiration . Emma , a vice president of technical design , noted , “I think traveling is a great way to 388 kind of open your horizons . It’s really important to understand other people and to understand 389 how people live and what they perceive as beautiful . This really just opens you to ideas . 390 Traveling is one , but also just looking around and exploring , you know , going to art museum 391 doing things that you wouldn’t normally do , pushing yourself . ” 392 Participants suggested that exposure to stimulating and diverse environments could be 393 used by companies and educators as a way to enhance creativity . Elizabeth , an associate 394 designer , described how her company encouraged employees to explore various places as a 395 source of inspiration , “We have this thing called black - out week , where we basically have a 396 week to come into the office for an hour or two , and then go out shopping and around the city to 397 find inspirations : thrift shops , sitting in a park and sketching…” As James , a creative director , 398 summarized this strategy for increasing creativity , “The more exposure I have to the world , the 399 better . So , I’m constantly challenging myself to be more exposed . ” 400 3 . 3 . 4 . Safe , yet Challenging Environment 401 Participants noted that educators can further help students develop creativity by providing 402 challenging yet safe environments . According to Abby , a freelance stylist , “Giving room to be 403 creative and not setting out very strict rules . You know , have high expectations , but maybe not 404 setting up very strict rules , separating more creative people from less creative and have different 405 demands for them , different expectations for different talents . ” Emma , a vice president of 406 technical design , discussed this from a business perspective : “ [ Company X ] really pushed 407 19 everyone in the company to think outside the box and it was really amazing because we did 408 things we really didn’t think were possible . ” Kris , a product development manager , added : 409 “When it’s a little bit more challenging , I feel , it makes you a little more creative , to think 410 outside the box , to think of different ways to do things . ” Lana , a chief merchandising officer , 411 reaffirmed that developing creative thinking takes practice , hard work and the right environment : 412 “I think you can teach problem solving skills , which to me is creativity . I think it does take a lot 413 of practice and if people are constantly challenged to . ” 414 4 . Discussions and Conclusions 415 In this study , twenty - eight fashion industry professionals shared their viewpoints and 416 experiences related to creative traits and strategies through in - depth interviews . Research 417 participants used a variety of descriptors to define creative people . As a result of the analysis , 418 four major creative traits emerged : different thought processes , determination , having an open 419 mind , and risk taking . Professionals disagreed on the origins of creativity . About one - third of 420 participants believed that creativity is innate , and therefore , some people were born creative 421 whereas others were not . Another third of participants maintained that everyone has some 422 creative potential that can be further developed . The remaining fashion professionals 423 distinguished artistic creativity from creative problem solving . Participants that believed 424 creativity could not be learned were primarily referring to artistic creativity . Those participants 425 that maintained creativity could be enhanced were referring to creative problem solving . 426 Participants suggested that formal training including classes and workshops could be effective 427 for cultivating creativity . It was noted that constant practicing of various thinking strategies— 428 such as approaching a problem from different perspectives , dissecting a problem into pieces to 429 solve them individually , or coming up with multiple solutions—would help enhance creativity . 430 20 Further , it was suggested that diverse experiences and exposure to the world were essential to 431 developing creativity . In this study , participants’ backgrounds , current positions , or job types 432 appeared to have no influence on their views on creative traits and strategies . To further 433 investigate how these two and other factors might affect fashion industry professionals’ 434 perspectives , a larger sample and a quantitative study using a survey methodology may be 435 employed . 436 Based on the themes of the three topical areas , the researchers proposed a framework to 437 help summarize and explain fashion industry professionals’ viewpoints on what might contribute 438 to developing creativity ( Figure ) . The left side of the figure represents strategies for cultivating 439 creativity . The process can happen through either formal ( courses , workshops ) training or 440 informal practicing creative thinking strategies , exposure to new and different experiences , as 441 well as creating environments that helped push people outside of their comfort zones and 442 broadened their perspectives . 443 Insert Figure here 444 The next step in the framework illustrates fashion industry professionals’ viewpoints on 445 the origins of creativity . For participants who viewed creativity as an innate gift , creativity was 446 most often associated with artistic type of activities , such as design , music , painting , etc . Those 447 that believed creativity could be developed often defined creativity as a form of problem solving , 448 distinct from artistic talents . Participants indicated that artistic creativity might be very difficult if 449 not impossible to develop in people who are not born with it . However , it can be enhanced 450 through the use of creativity strategies . In contrast , it was concluded that everyone can develop 451 creative problem solving skills through persistent practice . Distinguishing between innate 452 ( artistic ) and developed ( creative problem solving ) creativity might help explain the divide 453 21 between researchers and practitioners on the origins of creativity , whether all individuals can be 454 creative , and if it can be developed or learned . 455 Regardless of whether participants viewed creativity as primarily artistic expressions or 456 problem solving skills , they described the same traits typically displayed by creative people 457 ( Figure ) . Professionals maintained that developing certain personality traits would advance one’s 458 creativity . Therefore , creative traits serve as a predisposition to creativity , which is frequently 459 defined as a three - step process : problem or opportunity recognition , idea generation , and idea 460 realization or implementation ( Lemons , 2005 ; Mumford , 2003 ; Sternberg , 2006 ) . For example , 461 being open - minded and flexible helps an individual approach a problem from various 462 perspectives , while being passionate and persistent helps an individual generate multiple ideas or 463 possible solutions . Consequently , being determined , internally motivated , and open to risk taking 464 might help produce a greater number of creative ideas as well as initiative to implement the 465 ideas . Both creative traits and creativity are not “either / or”—either you have it , or you don’t , 466 rather they are on a continuum . Some people are naturally more willing to take risk ; others might 467 be more flexible , motivated , and / or persistent . Therefore , creative traits may be strongly 468 manifested and developed for some but could need cultivation in others . 469 Interpretation of the industry professionals’ viewpoints revealed findings that appear to 470 be applicable beyond the fashion industry . Participant perspectives indicated that creative traits 471 and strategies important in the fashion industry are similar to ‘general’ creative traits and 472 strategies and can be applied for creativity development in various industries . For example , the 473 creative traits discussed by the participants and suggested strategies to enhance creativity are not 474 unique to the fashion industry . This finding suggests that creative traits can be cultivated in 475 students and then applied in different domains . These results support the side of the continuing 476 22 debate that creative thinking is general rather than domain specific ( Baer , 2012 ) . Even though the 477 proposed framework of creative traits and strategies for developing creativity ( Figure ) is based 478 on viewpoints of fashion industry professionals , it appears to be transferable to other industries 479 and contributes to understanding how creative thinking can be developed in any individual . It 480 should be noted that the authors do not view the proposed framework as a complete and final but 481 rather as a next step toward mapping the phenomenon of creativity . 482 Rather than serving as a detriment , the universality of developing creativity can be used 483 by instructors in a wide array of fields to infuse creative thinking strategies within their courses , 484 whether they be in STEM ( science , technology , engineering , and math ) fields or the humanities . 485 Educators could use information regarding the creative traits and strategies to develop activities 486 and assessments for students to help increase their creative outputs . In a formal classroom 487 environment , instructors could provide opportunities for students to develop and practice creative 488 traits such as risk taking and flexibility or experiment with different thinking approaches / styles . 489 Employing various assessments and reflective assignments , educators might help students 490 understand that some might be more apt to creative thinking while others can intentionally and 491 systematically use creative thinking strategies to develop the skill . 492 Creativity is becoming increasingly important in not only the fast - paced and highly 493 competitive fashion industry , but economy and society at large ( DiLiello & Houghton , 2006 ; 494 Ford & Gioia , 2000 ) . Recent research suggests educational interventions are necessary for 495 enhancing American students’ creativity ( Bronson & Merryman , 2010 ) . This study provides 496 relevant strategies to develop creativity . This research furthers our understanding of creativity by 497 providing a holistic perspective on origins of creativity ( innate or developed ) , preconditions 498 ( creative traits ) as well as strategies for developing it . Creative thinking in individuals has been 499 23 linked to the ability to successful adaptations to the demands of daily life ( Cropley , 1990 ) . 500 Finally , the framework provides a starting point for better understanding the interplay between 501 individual traits and behaviors as well as the interaction between creative individuals , their ideas , 502 and society . 503 Prior to our research , no study had examined fashion industry professionals’ 504 understanding of creative traits and strategies . Gaining knowledge of such understanding is 505 helpful for creativity researchers as well as for educators and industry practitioners . Future 506 studies might explore perspectives of professionals from other industries that are both ‘closer’ 507 ( e . g . , interior / furniture or furniture design ) and ‘farther’ away from fashion design ( e . g . , auto , 508 planes , or computer design ) . Emerged differences and similarities from such investigations will 509 allow for a more complete mapping of the creative traits and strategies across domains . Future 510 studies may examine the importance of organizational structure on creativity and the creative 511 person . Since vocational personality traits tend to cluster into occupational areas ( Kerr & 512 McKay , 2012 ) , future researchers could develop instruments to help students decide if a career in 513 fashion suited their personalities . 514 515 516 24 References 517 Amabile , T .
