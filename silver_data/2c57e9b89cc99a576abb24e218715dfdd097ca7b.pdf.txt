For Victoria , Australia ( 6 . 6 million people ) , we evaluated 104 policy packages ( two levels of stringency of public health and social measures [ PHSMs ] , by two levels each of mask - wearing and respirator provision during large outbreaks , by 13 vaccination schedules ) for nine future SARS - CoV - 2 variant scenarios . Methods We used an agent - based model to estimate morbidity , mortality , and costs over 12 months from October 2022 for each scenario . The 104 policies ( each averaged over the nine future variant scenarios ) were ranked based on four evenly weighted criteria : cost - effectiveness from ( a ) health system only and ( b ) health system plus GDP perspectives , ( c ) deaths and ( d ) days exceeding hospital occupancy thresholds . Findings More compared to less stringent PHSMs reduced cumulative infections , hospitalisations and deaths but also increased time in stage ≥ 3 PHSMs . Any further vaccination from October 2022 decreased hospitalisations and deaths by 12 % and 27 % respectively compared to no further vaccination and was usually a cost - saving intervention from a health expenditure plus GDP perspective . High versus low vaccine coverage decreased deaths by 15 % and reduced time in stage ≥ 3 PHSMs by 20 % . The modelled mask policies had modest impacts on morbidity , mortality , and health system pressure . The highest - ranking policy combination was more stringent PHSMs , two further vaccine doses ( an Omicron - targeted vaccine followed by a multivalent vaccine ) for ≥ 30 - year - olds with high uptake , and promotion of increased mask wearing ( but not Government provision of respirators ) . Interpretation Ongoing vaccination and PHSMs continue to be key components of the COVID - 19 pandemic response . Integrated epidemiologic and economic modelling , as exempli ﬁ ed in this paper , can be rapidly updated and used in pandemic decision making .

Keywords : COVID - 19 ; Modelling ; Policy ; Economic ; Cost effectiveness Introduction The COVID - 19 pandemic is well into its third year , with ongoing high levels of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission driving signi ﬁ cant morbidity and mortality globally . This is due in part to the emergence of variants , such as Omicron and its sub - variants , that possess enhanced capacity to evade pre - existing immunity . Continued SARS - CoV - 2 evolution is likely , 1 now occurring against a backdrop of dynamic population immunity ( from vaccination , natural infection , or both ) and an expanding array of public health and clinical intervention options to respond to the pandemic . As such , COVID - 19 - related policy decisions must be made in the context of sub - stantial uncertainty , a signi ﬁ cant challenge for policy makers . In this complex environment it is increasingly important that the bene ﬁ ts and drawbacks of in - terventions are rigorously and systematically compared — including from a cost effectiveness perspective . 2 * Corresponding author .

Each policy was modelled in the context of nine future SARS - CoV - 2 variant scenarios ( eight combinations of low or high virulence , low or high antigenic similarity to the Omicron variant , and low or high immune escape capacity , in addition to a Research in context Evidence before this study We searched Ovid MEDLINE to 28 July 2022 for studies using the terms ( economic evaluation . mp . OR cost effectiveness . mp . OR health economic * . mp . ) AND ( simulation . mp . OR model * . mp . ) AND pandemic * . mp . to identify existing simulation modelling analyses of pandemic preparedness and response that incorporated cost effectiveness considerations . All identi ﬁ ed literature examined pandemic in ﬂ uenza and COVID - 19 and was highly heterogeneous in terms of modelled interventions ( which included school closures , masks , hand hygiene , vaccination , testing strategies , antiviral medication , physical distancing measures , indoor ventilation , and personal protective equipment ) , quality , context , model structure , and economic evaluation approach . Systematic reviews of COVID - 19 modelling studies that include a health economic component generally indicate that SARS - CoV - 2 testing , personal protective equipment , masks , and physical distancing measures are cost - effective . However , few prior studies consider optimal packages of interventions ( as opposed to standalone interventions ) , and none explicitly account for ongoing viral evolution or accurately capture the complexities of vaccine - or natural infection - derived immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 . For example , a previous study integrating a dynamic SARS - CoV - 2 transmission model with an economic analysis using a net monetary bene ﬁ t approach published in early 2021 emphasised the combined public health and economic advantages of COVID - 19 vaccination combined with physical distancing measures in the UK . However , considering current knowledge regarding the substantial waning of vaccine effectiveness and relatively low protection against infection conferred by vaccination ( compared to more severe clinical outcomes ) , this model likely over - estimated the impact of COVID - 19 vaccination on viral transmission . Scenarios that considered the emergence of SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern and thus associated changes in viral transmissibility , immune escape capacity ( which has , in the case of the Omicron variant , greatly reduced protection following vaccination and prior infection ) or virulence were also not modelled . Added value of this study To our knowledge , our study is the ﬁ rst that utilises a dynamic disease transmission model combined with an integrated economic evaluation framework to systematically compare COVID - 19 policy intervention packages while accounting for ongoing SARS - CoV - 2 evolution and waning population immunity . At a high - level , we found that a considerable degree of COVID - 19 disease burden should be expected in the future , with modelled interventions only able to partly mitigate pandemic - associated morbidity and mortality in the medium - term . Across nine plausible future SARS - CoV - 2 variant scenarios , higher stringency PHSMs notably reduced cumulative infections , hospitalisations and deaths in the 12 - month period modelled but had the tradeoff of higher expected societal economic losses . Increasing community mask - wearing and substituting cloth and surgical masks for government supplied respirators during periods of high SARS - CoV - 2 morbidity both reduced the number of days with hospital occupancy exceeding 750 COVID - 19 patients by 2 % on average across scenarios , and minimally reduced the cumulative infection , hospitalisation and death burden . Compared to no further vaccines , the modelled vaccination schedules ( with next - generation vaccines ; one or two further doses ) reduced hospitalisations by an average of 12 % , and deaths by 27 % . Vaccinating ≥ 30 - year - olds was modestly superior to just vaccinating ≥ 60 - year - olds ( reducing cumulative deaths , for example , by 3 . 1 % ) . Considering all policy options together , and ranking by optimality on cost - effectiveness , health system pressure and deaths , the highest ranking policy combinations tended to be a mix of higher stringency PHSMs , promotion to increase mask wearing but no Government - funded respirator provision during large outbreaks , and the administration of two booster vaccine doses within the 12 - month period to ≥ 30 - year - olds with associated high coverage ( noting gains from vaccinating ≥ 30 - year - olds compared to ≥ 60 - year - olds were modest ) . Implications of all the available evidence The policy implications of this study are three - fold . Firstly , it reinforces the cost - effectiveness of ongoing vaccination of the public to mitigate morbidity and mortality associated with COVID - 19 . Secondly , the characteristics of emerging SARS - CoV - 2 variants , outside the control of policy makers , will likely substantially in ﬂ uence public health outcomes associated with the pandemic in the future . Finally , at a phase of the pandemic characterised by growing intervention options urgently requiring prioritisation by decision makers alongside a large degree of ongoing uncertainty about future variants , this study provides a framework within which to systematically compare the health and economic bene ﬁ ts and burdens of packages of interventions that can be rapidly updated with new information ( such as estimated effectiveness and waning kinetics of newly - developed vaccines ) to support policy making .

Pol - icies were then ranked based on cumulative deaths , hospital system pressure , and cost effectiveness from both health system and health system plus GDP per - spectives in the 12 months from October 2022 , providing a framework for assessing optimal pandemic policy in the face of a rapidly evolving and uncertain future . Methods Agent - based model We used an agent - based model ( ABM ) 3 – 5 with a daily cycle length and 5000 agents scaled up to represent the Victorian population . Each agent moves in a two - dimensional space , creating opportunities for infection informed by parameters that in ﬂ uence viral trans - mission ( Table 1 , Appendix ) . The model was initially calibrated to the ﬁ rst COVID - 19 waves in Australia and New Zealand and has previously been used to inform policy in Victoria . For this study , the model was initiated with a virus re ﬂ ecting Omicron BA . 1 / 2 on 1 April 2022 , then a variant with immune escape representing Omi - cron BA . 4 / 5 was introduced to the model on 1 May 2022 . The model was then calibrated to match SARS - CoV - 2 transmission data from Victoria over the 60 days from 1 April 2022 and validated against case report ( assuming 50 % case ascertainment ) and hospitalisation data from Victoria between April and September 2022 ( Appendix ) . The former involved the addition of a “ carefulness ” parameter that interacted with biological susceptibility to infection to re ﬂ ect varying infection - avoidance behaviour by age and achieve the age distri - bution of infections occurring in Victoria during the calibration period . For the 12 months from 1 October 2022 , 936 scenarios ( 104 policy packages combined with nine viral variant scenarios ) were run 500 times each ( 500 separate draws of input parameters ) to generate estimates of COVID - 19 - related morbidity , mortality and costs over this period .

The ABM ( de ) escalates through these stages based on hospital occupancy thresholds and two PHSM policy options ( higher and lower stringency ; Table 2 ) . We modelled two mask policies — ( a ) a respirator ( e . g . , N95 mask ) substitution policy with options of no respirator provision or a respirator stockpile that is distributed to the population for use in place of cloth or surgical masks during large outbreaks ( de ﬁ ned as when the model was in stage ≥ 3 of PHSMs ) and ( b ) promo - tion of mask wearing during large outbreaks . The respirator policy did not change the overall percentage of people wearing masks but shifted respirator ( compared to cloth or surgical ) use from 20 % to 80 % among mask users . The mask promotion policy doubled overall mask use on the odds scale , e . g . , 40 % use be - comes 57 % use ( odds of use doubles from 40 % / 60 % = 0 . 67 to 57 % / 43 % = 1 . 33 ) . These policies were only active after the six - month lead - in period ( i . e . , the ﬁ nal quarter of 2022 onwards ) . Cloth and surgical masks were parameterised as reducing the odds of infection by approximately 50 % compared to no mask , and respirators by approximately 80 % ( Appendix ) . 10 Thirteen future vaccine schedules were modelled , incorporating next - generation COVID - 19 vaccines spe - ci ﬁ cally targeting the Omicron variant or targeting several variants ( multivalent vaccines ) . The 13 vaccine schedules were nil further vaccination from October 2022 , or 12 combinations of high or low uptake ( high = 75 % and 50 % , low = 50 % and 25 % for ≥ 60 - year - olds and 30 - to 59 - year - olds respectively ) , for ≥ 30 - or ≥ 60 - year - olds , with an Omicron - targeted ( OT ) vaccine in October to December 2022 plus one of no further doses , another OT vaccine in April to June 2023 , or a multi - valent vaccine in April to June 2023 . The multivalent vaccine was speci ﬁ ed to have twice the vaccine effec - tiveness ( VE ) on the odds scale of ﬁ rst - generation mRNA vaccines against all variants , and the Omicron - targeted vaccine twice the VE on the odds scale for variants antigenically like Omicron ( Appendix ) . A ﬁ rst - generation mRNA vaccine ( i . e . , a vaccine developed from the ancestral variant of SARS - CoV - 2 ) was admin - istered by default in all scenarios to reach the number of people vaccinated with three or four doses in Victoria as of the end of June 2022 . Subsequent vaccine schedules were then applied to individuals who had received at least three vaccine doses by the time each dose was rolled out . All modelled policy scenarios are summar - ised in Table 2 . Variant scenarios The dominant variant on 1 April 2022 was para - meterised to approximate the BA . 1 / 2 Omicron sub - variants ( R 0 8 – 10 , lower virulence ) , and gradually ( over approximately two months from 1 May 2022 ) replaced by a variant with additional immune escape capacity ( approximating Omicron BA . 4 / 5 ) . The emergence of eight potential new variants ( plus a sce - nario of no new variant emergence , i . e . , continued Omicron BA . 4 / 5 dominance ) from November 2022 was then modelled . New variants were characterised as either low viru - lence ( approximating Omicron ) or high virulence . To set the low virulence infection fatality risk ( IFR ) , we scaled age - speci ﬁ c IFRs associated with the ancestral variant 11 to match deaths observed in Victoria in April and May 2022 ( an Omicron BA . 2 - dominant period ) , taking into account previous infection and vaccination . This process was repeated using hospital and ICU admission risks . 12 We parameterised hypothetical high virulence future variants by assuming 4 , 4 0 . 75 , 4 0 . 5 and 4 0 . 25 ratio differ - ences ( on an odds scale ) in IFR , ICU admission risk , hospital admission risk and probability of being symp - tomatic given infection , respectively , between low and high virulence variants . This parameterisation aims to capture a shift in severity across the spectrum of clinical disease , meaning that a high compared to low virulence variant increases symptomatic infections by a ratio of 1 . 41 , hospitalisation if already symptomatic by 1 . 41 , ICU admission if hospitalised by 1 . 41 , and death as a ratio to ICU admissions by 1 . 41 . These increases loosely approximate Delta versus Omicron differences within strata of previous vaccination and infection status . 13 The immune escape capacity of new variants over that already possessed by Omicron BA . 4 / 5 was set as low or high using odds ratios ( ORs ) applied to VE esti - mates ( Appendix ) . Antigenic similarity to Omicron in ﬂ uenced the effectiveness of Omicron - targeted vac - cines against new variants with immune escape . Vaccine effectiveness and protection against reinfection Protection following vaccination or previous infection was a function of age , time since last vaccine or infec - tion ( i . e . , waning ) , the number and type of vaccine doses received , and the variant responsible for primary infec - tion , based on a previously published model of VE ( Appendix ) . 14 Morbidity and mortality We quanti ﬁ ed acute COVID - 19 morbidity using disability rates ( DRs ) from the Global Burden of Disease ( GBD ) study . 15 Morbidity was calculated separately for high and low virulence variant infections by altering the duration of illness and length of hospital stay . 16 , 17 Morbidity from long COVID was estimated based on reported symptoms and their prevalence and duration ( by age , severity of infection , vaccination status , and viral variant ) , each assigned a disability weight from the GBD study ( Appendix ) . 15 , 18 – 21 For each COVID - 19 death we estimated future HALY loss ( discounted at 3 % ) , assuming people dying of COVID - 19 have twice the Articles 4 www . thelancet . com Vol ▪ ▪ , 2023 mortality and 1 . 5 times the morbidity of the average person of the same sex and age ( Appendix ) . Economic analyses We used a net monetary bene ﬁ t ( NMB ) approach where total net health expenditure was subtracted from monetised HALYs at a given willingness to pay ( WTP ; Australian GDP per capita [ AUD 70 , 000 ] per HALY unless otherwise speci ﬁ ed ) in each model iteration , with two perspectives considered — health system only , and health system plus GDP loss ( Appendix ) . For acute illness we applied unit costs to each agent depending on their infection and clinical outcome status , including for testing , medication , ambulatory care , and hospital costs . We also determined healthcare utilisation costs for those experiencing long COVID based on international data and Australian clinical guidelines , strati ﬁ ed by acute disease severity , variant virulence , and vaccination status ( Appendix ) . Interventions were costed using the unit costs of vaccines and respirators , in addition to transportation , storage , vaccine administration , respirator distribution and health promotion costs where applicable ( Appendix ) . Net health expenditure was the sum of intervention costs ( e . g . , warehousing masks , purchasing Policy Details PHSM strategy Lower stringency Escalation : if the average expected number of people in hospital due to COVID - 19 10 – 14 days into the future is estimated to be > 600 per million → Stage 5 ; > 400 per million → Stage 4 ; > 270 per million → Stage 3 ; > 180 per million → Stage 2 .

Higher compliance In stages 3 – 5 the proportions of mask wearing above are increased by an odds ratio of 2 .

Vaccination strategy Vaccine schedules Three generic vaccines were modelled : ﬁ rst - generation mRNA vaccines ( FG ) ; next - generation Omicron - targeted vaccines ( OT ) with vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) on an odds scale of 2 against variants that are antigenically like Omicron compared to FG ; and next - generation multivalent vaccines ( MV ) with VE on an odds scale of 2 against all variants compared to FG . Low uptake : 50 % for ≥ 60 - year - olds , 25 % for 30 - to 59 - year - olds High uptake : 75 % for ≥ 60 - year - olds , 50 % for 30 - to 59 - year - olds 13 vaccine schedules were speci ﬁ ed ( following FG vaccine administration until end of Q2 2022 ) : 1 Nil further vaccination beyond Q2 2022 2 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 , ≥ 60 - year - olds , low uptake 3 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 , ≥ 60 - year - olds , high uptake 4 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 , ≥ 30 - year - olds , low uptake 5 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 , ≥ 30 - year - olds , high uptake 6 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 & OT vaccine in Q2 2023 , ≥ 60 - year - olds , low uptake 7 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 & OT vaccine in Q2 2023 , ≥ 60 - year - olds , high uptake 8 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 & OT vaccine in Q2 2023 , ≥ 30 - year - olds , low uptake 9 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 & OT vaccine in Q2 2023 , ≥ 30 - year - olds , high uptake 10 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 & MV vaccine in Q2 2023 , ≥ 60 - year - olds , low uptake 11 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 & MV vaccine in Q2 2023 , ≥ 60 - year - olds , high uptake 12 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 & MV vaccine in Q2 2023 , ≥ 30 - year - olds , low uptake 13 OT vaccine in Q4 2022 & MV vaccine in Q2 2023 , ≥ 30 - year - olds , high uptake Table 2 : Modelled policy options .

Costs to society due to PHSMs were assumed to be nil for stages 1 and 2 , and 10 % – 50 % of the Australian Government - estimated GDP losses per week from 2020 22 for approximately equivalent levels of restrictions in stages 3 – 5 . Health expenditure and GDP losses were all discounted at 3 % per annum . All costs are reported in 2021 Australian dollars ( 1 AUD = 0 . 695 USD in 2021 using OECD purchasing power parities ) . Ranking We ranked each policy option , averaged over all variant scenarios , by : ( a ) the cumulative number of SARS - CoV - 2 deaths over 12 months , ( b ) the number of days hospital occupancy by COVID - 19 patients was > 750 ( 114 per million ) or > 1500 ( 227 per million ) , ( c ) NMB from a health system perspective , and ( d ) NMB from a health system plus GDP perspective . We then generated an average ranking across these four dimensions . Ranking was sequential , i . e . , to determine the nth ranked policy option all policy options already ranked 1 to n - 1 were removed from the comparison . Note that whilst this provides a fair ‘ head - to - head ’ comparison among the remaining policy options , caution is required in inter - preting the incremental cost - effectiveness for the next top - ranked policy compared to policies already ranked and removed . For example , policies including masks often followed the same policy without masks in ranking , yet the incremental cost effectiveness of adding masks was poor . For key policy comparisons , we also calculated incremental cost - effectiveness ratios ( ICERs ) . Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses We generated tornado plots showing the variation in model outputs when comparing the lowest and highest quintiles of key input parameters . Additionally , we ran sensitivity analyses using an alternative discounting approach recommended by the UK Treasury 23 ( 1 . 5 % for HALYs and 3 . 5 % for costs ) , adjusting the WTP per HALY to $ 140 , 000 and $ 35 , 000 , and assuming people dying of COVID - 19 have 1 . 5 times the mortality and 1 . 25 times the morbidity of the average person of the same sex and age . Role of the funding source The funders of the study had no role in study design , data analysis , data interpretation , or writing of the report . Results Model validation The mean number of infections generated by the model from 1 April to 30 September 2022 was 3 . 2 million ( median 3 . 4 m , interquartile range [ IQR ] 2 . 5 – 4 . 1 m ) . The number of reported cases in Victoria in the same period was 1 . 3 million , 24 the same as the mean number of symptomatic infections output by the model . The mean number of COVID - 19 - related deaths was 2300 ( median 2 , 200 , IQR 1400 to 3000 ) compared to 2900 recorded in Victoria in the same period . 25 Health and cost impacts of modelled policies Across the 936 policy - by - variant scenarios the mean number of infections , hospitalisations and deaths over the 12 months from October 2022 output by the model were 4 . 2 million , 34 , 900 , and 8100 respectively . Fig . 1 shows cumulative infections , hospitalisations and deaths over the 12 - month period for the modelled policy options across the nine SARS - CoV - 2 variant scenarios . For ease of interpretation , each outcome is averaged over the four mask policies given their modest impact on health outcomes ; results for these and other key model outputs across all 936 scenarios are shown as heatmaps in Supplementary Figs . S1 – S10 . Mean total infections ranged from 1 . 8 million ( an antigenically Omicron - like variant with low immune escape and high virulence , with higher stringency PHSMs ) to 6 . 1 million ( an antigenically novel variant with low viru - lence and high immune escape , with lower stringency PHSMs ) . More stringent PHSMs reduced cumulative in - fections , hospitalisations and deaths by an average of 25 % , 24 % and 24 % across 468 comparisons with pol - icies containing less stringent PHSMs ( other policies and variant scenarios held constant ) . Any vaccination schedule from October 2022 , compared to no further vaccination , reduced hospitalisations by an average of 12 % and deaths by 27 % ( but resulted in a 10 % increase in infections as more transmission is tolerated within the hospitalisation thresholds used to set PHSM stages ) . Additional vaccination of 30 - to 59 - year - olds , compared to just vaccinating ≥ 60 - year - olds , reduced hospital - isations and deaths by 3 % , and resulted in a 2 % reduction in infections . High versus low vaccination coverage reduced deaths and hospitalisations on average by 15 % and 6 % , but also resulted in a 3 % increase in average infections . The mask promotion policy ( leading to increased mask wearing ) and respirator substitution policy ( leading to 80 % compared to 20 % of mask wearers wearing respirators , but no overall increase in mask wearing ) both applied during large outbreaks led to 1 % to 2 % decreases in cumulative infections , hospi - talisations and deaths . Fig . 2 similarly shows HALYs lost , net health expenditure and GDP loss for the 12 months following October 2022 . More stringent PHSMs gained 13 , 400 HALYs on average compared to less stringent PHSMs , across comparisons of scenarios varying only by PHSM policy ( 3390 HALYs gained on average in the setting of Articles 6 www . thelancet . com Vol ▪ ▪ , 2023 low virulence new variants , 26 , 200 for high virulence variants ) . Any vaccination schedule , compared with no further vaccination , gained 6370 HALYs on average . The mask promotion and respirator substi - tution policies led to an average of 840 and 650 HALYs gained , respectively . Net health expenditure predictably increased when moving from nil further vaccination to vaccination with increasing levels of population vaccination coverage . Net health expendi - ture varied substantially by emergent SARS - CoV - 2 variant when PHSMs were less stringent . GDP los - ses also varied widely across variant scenarios and were 482 % greater on average for the higher strin - gency PHSM strategy .

This ranking used sequential net monetary bene ﬁ t ( NMB ) analyses , whereby the proportion of times each of the 104 policy options had the highest NMB across the 500 iterations ( i . e . , pooling the nine SARS - CoV - 2 strata , meaning they were equally weighted in likelihood ) was determined . The top ranked policy was selected and put aside . The remaining 103 policies were re - analysed , the now remaining top - ranked policy identi ﬁ ed and put aside .

Note , this inherently weights these four constructs Articles www . thelancet . com Vol ▪ ▪ , 2023 9 beneath a target , the societal gain from high versus low vaccination coverage manifested as 20 % fewer days with stage 3 or greater restrictions . The number of days with > 750 COVID - 19 patients admitted was an average of 82 days ( 54 % ) less under the more stringent compared to less stringent PHSM policy . The mask policies , applied during large outbreaks , reduced days with > 750 COVID - 19 patients in hospital by 3 to 4 days ( 2 % ) across all comparisons , but for high virulence variants the mask policies reduced days with > 750 hospitalisations by 8 – 10 days ( 4 % to 5 % ) . Incremental cost effectiveness ratios Mean HALY losses and net health expenditure changes can be used to calculate ICERs . For example , Supplementary Fig . S17 shows ICERs for every head - to - head comparison of any ongoing vaccination schedule incremental to no further vaccination ( from a health system perspective ) . The mean ICER for any vaccine schedule for ≥ 60 - year - olds , averaged across all 432 possible incremental comparisons with nil further vaccination , was $ 77 , 500 per HALY gained ( median $ 58 , 800 , 95 % range $ 33 , 800 – $ 248 , 000 ) . The mean ICER for additionally vaccinating 30 - to 59 - year - olds was $ 41 , 600 ( median $ 42 , 700 , 95 % range $ 22 , 700 – $ 65 , 700 ; generated based on the difference in health expenditure and HALYs for vaccinating all ≥ 30 - year - olds compared to just ≥ 60 - year - olds ) . Considered in isolation , these ICERs for vaccination may exceed a funder ’ s usual WTP . However , the bene ﬁ ts of vaccination for society also manifest as reduced societal costs such as time under higher stages of PHSMs , and lesser GDP loss . Accordingly , from a health plus GDP perspective any vaccination was usually cost saving ( Supplementary Fig . S18 ) . More stringent PHSMs , compared to less stringent , were dominant ( i . e . , cost saving and resulting in health gain ) from a health system only perspective for 28 % of the 468 comparisons where other policies and variant characteristics were the same . Of the remaining 72 % of comparisons , the average cost was $ 14 , 500 per HALY gained from a health system - only perspective ( maximum $ 41 , 800 ) . However , from a health plus GDP perspective the average cost was $ 186 , 000 per HALY gained ( median $ 136 , 000 , 95 % range $ 94 , 000 – $ 387 , 000 ) . Increasing mask use when in stages ≥ 3 ( from , for example , 45 % – 62 % among people aged 20 – 49 years in stage 3 ) , was usually dominant from both health and health plus GDP perspectives , despite not dramatically reducing cumulative hospi - talisations and deaths . This policy was assumed to be achieved through media promotion campaigns only , costing approximately $ 15 , 000 per day . The provision of respirators during large outbreaks by the govern - ment was not cost effective from either a health or health plus GDP perspective . Optimal ranking using net monetary bene ﬁ t , hospital occupancy and deaths As evident above , there are many separate policy con - siderations and interactions that make decision - making complex and dif ﬁ cult during a pandemic . Therefore , Fig . 3 presents policies ranked by NMB from health system and health system plus GDP perspectives , high hospital occupancy , and deaths . Weighting these four measures evenly , the highest ranked policy was more stringent PHSMs , two further vaccine doses ( an Omicron - targeted vaccine followed by a multivalent vaccine ) for ≥ 30 - year - olds with high coverage , and pro - motion of increased mask wearing ( but not government provision of respirators ) . The top ten ranked policies usually included two further rounds of vaccination , vaccinating ≥ 30 - year - olds with high coverage , and higher stringency PHSMs with increased overall mask wearing during large outbreaks . Note that whilst in - terventions with the respirator provision policy did occur in the top ten , they only did so after removing the same intervention without respirators ; the ICERs dis - cussed above indicate that a policy of government pro - vision of respirators is not incrementally cost effective . The rankings in Fig . 3 consider each of the nine future SARS - CoV - 2 variant scenarios equally likely ; for users that wish to weight differently the likelihood of future variants ( e . g . , the next major variant being more likely to possess a high level of additional immune escape capacity ) or alter the weighting of the four criteria , Fig . 3 can be reproduced with these alternative settings at an interactive online tool . 26 Sensitivity analyses Supplementary Fig . S19 shows the ranking as above , and for sensitivity analyses using UK Treasury - recommended discount rates ( 1 . 5 % per annum for HALYs , 3 . 5 % per annum for costs ) , HALYs valued at $ 35 , 000 and $ 140 , 000 , and assuming people dying of COVID - 19 have 1 . 5 times the mortality and 1 . 25 times the morbidity of the average person of the same sex and age ( as opposed to 2 and 1 . 5 times respectively as used in the main analysis ) . Rankings were similar across these sensitivity analyses . The tornado plots shown in Supplementary Fig . S20 indicate that uncertainty regarding the transmission equally in selecting the overall optimal policy ; different decision makers wish to apply different weights across these four metrics . Policies ranking in the top 50 are presented here .

Articles 10 www . thelancet . com Vol ▪ ▪ , 2023 potential of asymptomatic compared to symptomatic individuals drove signi ﬁ cant amounts of uncertainty across multiple model outputs . Uncertainty regarding the waning of immunity following vaccination or infection was responsible for much of the uncertainty around cumulative hospitalisations and deaths . Discussion Decision makers increasingly require frameworks to systematically weigh up the costs and bene ﬁ ts of pandemic policy choices . 2 A growing number of recent publications integrate economic evaluation with epide - miologic modelling in an attempt to facilitate decision making in the context of the COVID - 19 pandemic . 27 – 29 However , none have examined combined in - terventions , accounted for SARS - CoV - 2 evolution , accurately represented waning immunity , and included both acute COVID - 19 and long COVID morbidity simultaneously . Our model addresses all these imperatives . This study examines 936 future scenarios , formed by cross - classifying 104 policy options with nine future variant scenarios . Irrespective of the policies imple - mented , signi ﬁ cant ongoing SARS - CoV - 2 - related morbidity and mortality is predicted by this model in the coming months and years ; control over cumulative viral transmission was limited given the scenario spec - i ﬁ cations . Nevertheless , meaningful policy recommen - dations still emerge from this analysis . Firstly , we found that higher stringency PHSMs tended to perform better when outcomes were assessed from a health system perspective , but this was often in con ﬂ ict with ﬁ ndings when GDP losses were consid - ered . This con ﬂ ict of perspectives makes explicit the tension between protecting public health and protecting the economic interests of society at this stage of the pandemic . Earlier in the pandemic , in the absence of vaccines and especially for countries pursuing a zero - COVID strategy , optimal policies from health and soci - etal perspectives were more clearly aligned . 22 This tradeoff between health and societal criteria emphasises the importance of developing explicit frameworks such as ours to manage these competing interests . Overall , when considering cost effectiveness , hospital system pressure and population mortality , lower thresholds for escalating restrictions ( i . e . , higher stringency PHSMs ) consistently performed better despite their associated economic trade - offs . Secondly , government provision of respirators to the public ( to use as an alternative to surgical or cloth masks , increasing respirator use from 20 % to 80 % of mask - wearers ) and increases in mask wearing once large outbreaks had already occurred only had modest effects on morbidity and mortality . A likely reason for the limited impact of these policies on health outcomes is that during infection peaks ( when these policies were activated ) many people are con ﬁ ned at home where masks are not worn . Another reason may be the now high innate transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 variants ; masks reduce the immediate risk of transmission , 10 but do not make it zero . This may serve more to increase the number of days to infection or delay the interval be - tween infections rather than prevent it altogether . Delay of infection may still be useful to ‘ ﬂ atten ’ the epidemic curve and protect health services from being over - whelmed . Indeed , reduced days with hospital capacity exceeding thresholds of > 750 and > 1500 COVID - 19 patients were seen when respirator substitution and increased mask wearing policies were active , although these reductions were modest . We are exploring further these short - and long - term tradeoffs of mask wearing elsewhere , including through modelling increased mask - wearing at all times rather than just during surges of infection . Third , the provision of any vaccine booster was consistently seen to be more bene ﬁ cial than not providing ongoing vaccination . While differences in the vaccine schedules modelled were not dramatic when considering individual model outputs in isolation , and the incremental cost effectiveness ratios of vaccination policies from a health system only perspective were often at the threshold of what funders might be pre - pared to pay per HALY gained , when also considering societal gains ( i . e . , reduced time in higher stage PHSMs ) our policy ranking results suggest that ongoing regular vaccination should continue to play a key role in the pandemic response despite the associated ﬁ nancial costs . Of note , vaccinating people aged 30 years and over appeared to be more optimal than targeted vaccination of people aged ≥ 60 — at least within our model that had dynamic PHSMs in response to hospital occupancy . Our modelling parameterised Omicron - targeted vaccines as having twice the VE on the odds scale against Omicron BA . 1 / 2 ( and antigenically similar var - iants ) compared to ﬁ rst - generation mRNA vaccines ( e . g . , BNT162b2 and mRNA - 1273 ) . This is equivalent to increasing peak VE for agents in the model against any infection from 51 . 6 % ( the value we use at two weeks post second dose for younger adults ; see Appendix for details ) to 68 . 0 % , or VE against death from 96 . 9 % to 98 . 4 % . These ratio increases in VE are supported by preliminary serologic data for bivalent ancestral - and Omicron - targeted vaccines , compared to ancestral - targeted vaccine only . 30 Our model also includes the same waning of protection over time for ﬁ rst - and next - generation vaccines , and a 50 % higher unit cost for multivalent vaccines compared to both ﬁ rst - generation and Omicron - targeted vaccines . Whilst these seem reasonable assumptions at the time of writing , it will be important to revise these assumptions with updated estimates of expected VE and waning ( e . g . , based on in vitro antibody titers 31 , 32 or , ideally , real - world VE studies ) and updated costs . Such model ﬂ exibility , Articles www . thelancet . com Vol ▪ ▪ , 2023 11 augmented by both comprehensive surveillance systems monitoring SARS - CoV - 2 variant emergence and close links to vaccine producers with the capacity to rapidly deliver new vaccines , suggests a fruitful policy pathway to better population health outcomes over the remainder of this ( and future ) pandemics . In comparison to similar models our framework has many advantages . We simulated combined in - terventions to re ﬂ ect the fact that policy choices are not made in isolation , modelled viral evolution , developed a novel method to quantify long COVID morbidity , and accounted for acute COVID - 19 , long COVID and intervention costs in addition to future health expendi - ture and the economic consequences of PHSMs . Uniquely , our model also includes a data - driven repre - sentation of waning protection following vaccination , previous infection , or both , in contrast to most previ - ously published COVID - 19 transmission models . 33 While there are substantial gaps in the COVID - 19 literature ( e . g . , regarding the risk and symptom pro ﬁ le of long COVID , the waning of natural infection - derived immunity , the effect of immunity on onward trans - mission once infected , and the infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals ) , we incorporated generous uncertainty in model inputs , re ﬂ ect the impact of un - certainty in our results , and still ﬁ nd important differ - ences that lead to certain policies being quanti ﬁ ed as more optimal . Sensitivity analyses provide insights into priority areas for research to better parameterise future models , including the need to develop a greater under - standing of the transmission potential of asymptomatic compared to symptomatic individuals and the kinetics of immunity waning following vaccination or infection . Our model only allows for the emergence of one new variant during the 12 - month period from October 2022 . Future modelling could allow for important new vari - ants emerging more frequently , but ( if using our modelling framework ) this will increase the number of SARS - CoV - 2 variant scenarios and make the results more challenging to summarise and interpret . Future modelling should also include sequelae other than the long COVID symptoms accounted for here ( e . g . , post - acute cardiovascular complications of COVID - 19 ) as this evidence base improves , 34 and would likely bene ﬁ t from increased consideration of population heteroge - neity ( such as the distribution of underlying medical comorbidities , for example ) and indirect effects of COVID - 19 on the health system ( such as impacting access to routine health services ) . We speci ﬁ ed lower underlying susceptibility to infection among children , compared to adults — as do many other models of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Model calibration in this regard was performed in two steps : ( a ) speci ﬁ cation of biological susceptibility difference by age ( Table 1 ) and , critically , ( b ) a second step involving the addition of a “ carefulness ” factor that these sus - ceptibilities were multiplied by for the model to output the age distribution of cases actually observed in Victo - ria . Therefore , if one was to set the biological suscepti - bility by age to be uniform , this carefulness scalar would change accordingly with little ( if any ) likely impact on model outputs . In other words , calibration to the pattern of cases by age surpasses the in ﬂ uence of the suscepti - bility by age parameter . Finally , a limited number of policy options were considered . It is important to recognise that minor ad - justments in these policies ( e . g . , altering the baseline use of masks at all stages , changing vaccine schedules , modifying the cost or type of respirators modelled , or adding emerging interventions such as antiviral medi - cations ) could signi ﬁ cantly alter the results . Modelled policies should be re ﬁ ned as policy discussions in the Australian and international contexts further develop to ensure relevance ; for example , guidance regarding vaccination of young people may change as information regarding the risks and bene ﬁ ts of vaccinating this population evolves , or there may be a reluctance in future for governments to impose the kinds of re - strictions included in stages 4 and 5 of the PHSMs modelled here . Coding differences between jurisdic - tions also mean that COVID - 19 - related hospitalisations , which are used as triggers for moving through PHSM stages in this model , should be locally contextualised . Decision making during the COVID - 19 pandemic is challenging and requires consideration of the costs and bene ﬁ ts of interventions in an increasingly complex policy environment . This model demonstrates that in the absence of , for example , a new vaccine associated with substantially less VE waning or improved neutral - ising protection against infection , the health system in Victoria — and similar jurisdictions internationally — should be prepared for signi ﬁ cant ongoing COVID - 19 - related morbidity and mortality over the next 12 months . It reaf ﬁ rms the importance of regular COVID - 19 vaccination and PHSMs as key tools in the ongoing pandemic response . Crucially , this modelling provides a framework that can be rapidly updated to systematically compare the health and economic bene ﬁ ts and burdens of COVID - 19 policy options despite a highly uncertain future .
