Regular physical activity is a major health determinant . Little is known about physical activity trends . We evaluated whether adult physical activity levels are changing in a Swiss urban state ( Geneva ) . Method . We analyzed 11 - year trends of physical activity indicators , including 3 + MET - minutes per week and physical activity outside working hours , in population representative adults ( n = 9320 , aged 35 – 74 years , 50 % women ) , relating declared physical activity to socioeconomic status , lifestyle , and clinical and blood markers . Results . Combining yearly cohorts from 1999 to 2009 , we found a signi ﬁ cant trend for increased physical activity levels . Weekly age and sex adjusted 3 + MET - minutes per week increased from 3023 to 3752 , be - tween 1999 and 2009 ( P = 0 . 02 ) . The increase also concerned physical activity outside working hours ( + 18 kcal / day / year ) . Therewasashiftfromlowlevelsofphysicalactivitylevelstowardshigheractivities . Physical activity indicators were associated with socioeconomic status , comorbidities , and biological and anthropometric measures . The trend for increased physical activity was more prominent over the latter 5 years . Conclusion . WefoundthatphysicalactivitylevelshaveincreasedinanurbanSwissstate .

Introduction Insuf ﬁ cient regular physical activity ( PA ) increases all - cause mortal - ity risk ( Archer and Blair , 2011 ; WHO , 2011 ) . Over 60 % of the world ' s population lacks suf ﬁ cient PA ( WHO , 2011 ) . Increased transportation , labor saving technology at home and work , and less physically active recreational activities decrease PA ( Knuth and Hallal , 2009 ) . Continued monitoring of PA levels is important in order to document if PA levels change . International comparisons suggest differences in PA trends in the general adult population , with decreasing PA in some countries ( e . g . , USA ( Brownson et al . , 2005 ; Church et al . , 2011 ) , Spain ( Meseguer et al . , 2011 ) ) and increasing PA in some others ( e . g . , Finland ( Barengo et al . , 2002 ; Borodulin et al . , 2007 ) , Canada ( Craig et al . , 2004 ) , Australia ( Chau et al . , 2008 ) ) . Since 1993the ‘ Bus Santé ’ study ( Morabia et al . , 1997 ) documents PA in yearly representative population samples of the State of Geneva ( 470 , 000 inhabitants in 2011 ) . Using data from the ‘ Bus Santé ’ study , Galobardes et al . reported that from 1993 to 2000 physical inactivity prevalence in Geneva state remained high and invariant ( Galobardes et al . , 2003 ) . We hypothesized that PA levels continued to remain low and stable over the next ten years . We therefore determined trends in PA levels in Geneva using population representative data collected from 1999 to 2009 obtained with the same PA assessment method as used in the 1993 – 2000 analysis . In addition , better understanding the causes of PA behavior is a pre - requisite for interventions to increase PA . Correlates of PA ( factors asso - ciated with PA ) and determinants of PA ( with a causal relationship ) remain to be better de ﬁ ned ( Bauman et al . , 2012 ) . Of particular interest is todeterminetheroleofage , sex , education , healthandsocioeconomic status ( Bauman et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , we examined the association of car - diovascular riskfactors , biomarkers , and socioeconomic factors with PA . Methods Participants The ‘ BusSanté ’ study is anon - going cross - sectional population - basedstudy , whichcollectsinformationoncardiovascularriskfactors , dietandPA ( Guessous et al . , 2012 ) . Brie ﬂ y , every year a representative strati ﬁ ed sample of 500 men and 500 women from the population of the State of Geneva is recruited and studied in two ﬁ xed and one mobile medical unit . Trained collaborators inter - view and examine participants . All procedures are reviewed and standardized across technicians on a regular basis . Subjects are selected independently throughout each year to represent the Canton ' s approximately 100 , 000 male and100 , 000femalenon - institutionalizedresidentsaged35to74 years . Eligible subjects are identi ﬁ edusinga standardized procedure usinganannual residen - tial list established by the local government .

The 1999 – 2009 mean participa - tion rate was 60 % ( range : 55 % – 65 % ) . The Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study . All participants gave written informed consent . Physical activity PAwasquanti ﬁ edbythesamequestionnairethroughout ( PAFQ ) , developed for the Geneva population as reported in detail elsewhere ( Bernstein et al . , 1998 ) . Inshort , a data - basedapproach was used ; a 24 - hour recall was adminis - tered to a random sample of 919 adult residents of Geneva , Switzerland . The data obtained were then used to establish a list of activities and their median duration that contributed to 95 % of the energy expended . The PAFQ method was then validated in 41 volunteers against heart rate , prior to being calibrated with indirect calorimetry . The total energy estimated by the PAFQ correlated satisfactorily ( r = 0 . 76 ) with estimates using heart rate ( Bernstein et al . , 1998 ) . Respondents indicated days in the past week ( 0 to 7 ) and duration perday ( 0to10 hin15 minincrements ) foreachof70activitiesofwhichinten - sity is estimated with published multiples of METs ( metabolic equivalent of task , 1 MET = 1 kcal / kg / h , approximating the energy expended during quiet sitting ) . Sex , age , weight and height speci ﬁ c resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) was estimated for each participant using the FAO / WHO / UNU equation ( FAO / WHO / UNU . Energy and Protein Requirements . Report of a Joint FAO / WHO / UNU Expert Consultation . Technical Report Series No . 724 . Geneva : World Health Organization , 1985 ) . The PAFQ includes two sections : a professional activity section and a non - professional activity section . The participants ﬁ ll out the sections accordingly . For example , participants without professional activities ( e . g . , retired , jobless ) will ﬁ ll out only the non - professional activity section . Subjects aged 65 years ormorewill ﬁ lloutbothsectionsiftheystillhaveprofessionalactivities . Trained collaborators verify the correct use of the questionnaire at the occasion of the visit for the measurements . Wederived : 1 ) totaldailyenergyexpenditure ( kcal / day ) ( TEE ) : for allPA ( i ) , the product of MET ( i ) × duration ( i ) in minutes per day × RMR in kcal was summed to RMR and thermic effect of food ( 10 % TEE ) ; 2 ) 3 + MET - minutes perweek : foreachPA ( i ) withMET ≥ 3 , theproductofMET ( i ) × duration ( i ) inmi - nutes perweek wascomputed and thesum acrossallsuchactivities calculated ; 3 ) daily EE related to physical activity only ( kcal / day ) : TEE − RMR ; 4 ) non - professional daily EE ( NPEE , kcal / day ) : EE ( kcal / day ) restricted to leisure - time activities ; 5 ) physical activity level ( PAL ) : TEE / RMR ; 6 ) weekly minutes spent in light ( 1 . 6 – 2 . 9 METs ) , moderate ( 3 – 5 . 9 METs ) , and vigorous ( 6 – 8 . 9 METs ) activities ; and weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) , the sum of moderate and vigorous activities . Measurements Body weight , height , blood pressure , and waist and hip circumferences were measured using standard procedures ( Guessous et al . , 2012 ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) was de ﬁ ned as weight / height 2 and waist - hip ratio ( WHR ) was calculated . Overweight and obesity were de ﬁ ned as BMI 25 . 0 – 29 . 9 , and ≥ 30 kg / m 2 , respectively . Fasting blood samples were collected and glucose , totalplasmacholesterol , HDLplasmacholesterolandtriglycerideswereassayed by using commercially available enzymatic kits ( Bayer Technicon Diagnostics , CV 1 . 4 % , 1 . 2 % , and 1 . 5 % , for glucose , cholesterol and triglycerides , respectively ) . Socioeconomic indicators Self reported education , income , and occupation were classi ﬁ ed as : 1 ) education : low ( elementary school or apprenticeship ) ; and high ( maturity / baccalaureate or higher ) ; 2 ) household monthly income ( Francs , 1CHF ≈ 1US $ as of September 2013 ) : b 3000 CHF ; 3000 – 4999 CHF ; 5000 – 6999 CHF ; 7000 – 9499 CHF ; 9500 – 13 , 000 CHF ; and N 13 , 000 CHF ; 3 ) occupation : non - manual , manager or independent ; non - manual , employed ; manual , independent ; manual , employed ; and man - at - home , retired , jobless , or disability insurance . Medical history and comorbidities Smokingstatus ( neversmokers , ex - smokers , currentsmokers ) , medicalhis - tory and comorbidities ( myocardial infarction , diabetes , hypertension , hyper - cholesterolemia ) were self - reported . Subjects with fasting glucose N 7 mmol / L , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 140 mm Hg , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 90 mm Hg , or total cholesterol N 6 . 5 mmol / L were considered having diabe - tes , hypertension or hypercholesterolemia . Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 10 . 0 ( Stata Corp , College Station , USA ) . Continuous variables were expressed as median ± con ﬁ dence intervals ( CI ) orstandarderrors ( SE ) . Medianregressionswereusedtoestimate adjusted PA and to assess associations of PA indicators with survey year , socio - economic status , anthropometric and biologic measures . Below , we report the associations between determinants and the 3 + MET - minutes per week PA indicator . Mean regressions were used to estimate adjusted proportion in light , moderate and high PA , by survey year . PAindicatorsbysexwere adjusted for age and PA indicators by age were adjusted for sex . All other analyses were adjusted for both sex and age . In addition , we considered the temporal changes inattributesthatcouldpotentiallyin ﬂ uencePAlevelsandranadditionalmodels adjusting for those attributes when they presented signi ﬁ cant changes . The linearity of association between PA indicators and survey year was tested using median regression . When linearity was not rejected ( P ≥ . 05 ) , linear trendsweretestedusinglinearregression . Whenlinearitywasrejected , median regression was used to test trends . Because fewer participants were included in years 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 we conducted additional analyses combining years 2005 to 2008 .

Guessous et al . / Preventive Medicine 59 ( 2014 ) 25 – 30 Author ' s personal copy Results Population characteristics Participants ' characteristics are described in Table 1 . Information on PA and cardiovascular comorbidities was available for 9320 subjects . Information on biological and socioeconomic measures were available for a subset of the cohorts . Cohorts 1999 – 2004 and 2009 had on aver - age 1159 subjects . The 2005 – 2008 yearly average was 302 because another study relied on the same infrastructure limiting the capacity for further recruitment . Participants ' characteristics by survey year are described in Table S1 . Several characteristics including smoking status , BMI status , hypertension , and education level differed across survey years . PA trends AnnualPA indicator changes are summarized in Table2 . Age and sex adjusted 3 + MET - minutes per week increased by 124 3 + MET - minutes per week per year ( P = 0 . 02 ) . Using 1999 as baseline there was a signi ﬁ cant increase for years 2006 through 2009 ( Fig . 1 ) . Consid - ering men , the 11 - year trend was borderline and compared to 1999 only 2006 and 2009 showed higher PA . Considering women , the 11 - year trend was signi ﬁ cant , while 2008 and 2009 were signi ﬁ cantly different from the 1999 baseline . Both EE above RMR and non - professional PA daily EE trends in - creased between 1999 and 2009 . A major rise occurred since 2006 , especially in men . These trends were not the result of a trend for an increase in RMR ( P = 0 . 40 ) . Age and sex - adjusted PAL ( TEE / RMR ) signi ﬁ cantly increased over the 11 - year period in women ( + 0 . 0021 / year , P = 0 . 020 ) but not in men ( P = 0 . 10 ) . Age adjusted weekly time spent in light activities ( 1 . 6 – 2 . 9 METs ) in women decreased by 33 weekly minutes each year ( P b 0 . 001 ) . Age and sex - adjusted weekly minutes spent in moderate activities ( 3 – 5 . 9 METs ) increased overall and in women ; there was no signi ﬁ cant trend in men . Weekly minutes spent in vigorous activities ( 6 – 8 . 9 METs ) increased in both men and women . Age - group effects For 3 + MET - minutes per week there was no signi ﬁ cant trend for the 35 – 49 year group . By contrast , there were signi ﬁ cant trends in the 50 – 64 and 65 – 74 year groups , with annual increases of 51 and 120 3 + MET - minutes per week , respectively ( P = 0 . 013 and P b 0 . 001 ) . For total daily PA related EE , an increase was only seen for the 65 – 74 year age group ( + 18 kcal / day / year , P b 0 . 001 ) . For EE in non - professional PA , thetrendwassigni ﬁ cantin all three age groups . Similar increases were observed for weekly minutes spent in 3 + METs PA . For PAL , there was again only an increase in the 65 – 74 year group ( + 0 . 005 / year , P b 0 . 02 ) . There was a decrease in the time spent in light activities in the 50 – 64 year group ( − 21 . 8 min / year , P b 0 . 001 ) . All three groups showed a signi ﬁ cant trend for weekly time spent in moderate intensity PA or vigorous PA ( 6 – 9 METs ) . The trend in the 35 – 39 year group was not signi ﬁ cant . Overall the data indicate that there was a shift from the lower inten - sity category to the moderate category for all three age groups , and to the higher intensity category for the 35 – 39 year and the 65 – 74 year age groups .

We found no association between 3 + MET - minutes per week and other medical his - toryorcomorbidities . Lower3 + MET - minutes per weekwasassociated with higher BMI ( − 5 . 5 , P = 0 . 01 ) , with a trend over time . Higher WHR values were associated with lower 3 + MET - minutes per week ( − 21 . 9 , P = 0 . 03 ) . Adjustedfor age , sex , and survey year , subjects with high ed - ucation level had lower activity than subjects with low education ; there was no interaction with survey year . Compared to the category of non - manual , managerial or independent labor , all other categories had higher 3 + MET - minutes per week , especially those with manual labor type occupations . There were no trends over the 11 - year period . Among the different blood markers , only serum triglyceride concentra - tion was associated with 3 + MET - minutes per week ( − 390 . 9 , P b 0 . 001 ) . We found a signi ﬁ cant interaction with survey year , sug - gesting that the triglycerides - 3 + MET - minutes per week association differed across survey year ( Table 3 ) . Discussion We found a signi ﬁ cant trend for increased PA levels in a Swiss urban population from 1999 to 2009 . This is encouraging , since durable in - creases in PA should improve population health . The observed increase seems to stem from a change in PA patterns . There was a shift from low intensity PA towards moderate / high or vigorous PA , while overall ener - gyexpenditurelevelsandPAL ( TEE / RMR ) increasedslightly . Thechange rather occurred outside the occupational setting . An analysis in the Geneva state of an earlier period ( 1993 – 2000 ) , which used the same questionnaire ( PAFQ ) , reported no change in PA levels ( Galobardes et al . , 2003 ) . Using a different methodology ( asking for weekly sweating episodes ) , other researchers in Switzerland re - ported that the proportion of adults with less than one vigorous exer - cise episode per week increased from 36 % to 39 % between 1992 and 1997 , but then decreased again to 37 % by 2002 and to 32 % by 2007 ( Martin et al . , 2009 ) . Our results indicate that from 1999 to 2009 , the annual changes in weekly minutes spent in moderate and vigorous in - tensity PA were + 18 . 6 and + 4 . 6 , respectively . Based on the current WHO recommendations ( do at least 150 min of moderate - intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 min of vigorous - intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week ) , these annual changes represent 12 % and 6 % relative increases . It is dif ﬁ cult to size the clinical impact of such shallow changes , but on a population level they should lead to decreases in morbidity . A re - cent analysis of objectively measured PA from the NHANES data showed that each additional daily minute of higher - intensity activity lowered the odds of obesity by 5 % for women , and by 2 % for men ( Fan et al . , 2013 ) . Some of the observed PA trends might potentially be attributable to campaigns promoting PA . Whether such programs are effective is dif ﬁ - cult to determine without large population - based data collected before and after such campaigns . InSwitzerland , severalfederaland state cam - paigns promoting PA were launched during the last decade . Before the Swiss campaigns promoting PA , the proportion of the adult population in Geneva with insuf ﬁ cient PA had remained stable ( Galobardes et al . , 2003 ) . The Geneva “ GeBouge ” ( movement and sport for all ) campaign started summer 2005 ; the Geneva “ Marcher et manger malin ” ( walk and eat cleverly ) campaign started summer 2006 ; the Swiss - wide “ Poids corporel sain ” ( healthy body weight ) campaign started early 2007 . The parallelism between these campaigns and the observed increase of PA in our analysis is striking . However , bias from socially de - sirable answers in the realm of increased public awareness of the impor - tance of physical activity cannot be excluded , although several studies found , contrary to other types of behavior , that declared PA is not in ﬂ u - enced by social desirability ( Jago et al . , 2007 ; Crutzen and Goritz , 2011 ) .

Guessous et al . / Preventive Medicine 59 ( 2014 ) 25 – 30 Author ' s personal copy Geneva regularly counts bicycle use by direct observation and reported signi ﬁ cant increases in the same period ( Rapport Vélos , 2011 ) . The Swiss Health Survey includes questions on physical activity since 1992 . After a clear drop observed between 1992 and 1997 , Swiss - wide levels of physical activity between 2002 and 2007 showed some increase ( Martin et al . , 2009 ) , corroborating our ﬁ ndings . Even though impact of media campaigns should not be exaggerated , there is good evidence from observational and modeling studies that physical activity promo - tiondoeshaveeffect ( Kahnetal . , 2002 ; Cobiacetal . , 2009 ) . Speculatively , our ﬁ ndings may re ﬂ ect ef ﬁ cacy of campaigns between 2005 and 2009 . Correlates of physical activity There was an association between PA , expressed as weekly minutes spent in 3 + METs , and cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes , BMI , waist - to - hip circumference ratio , and triglycerides . This is in line with previous reports ( Jeon et al . , 2007 ; Monda et al . , 2009 ) . We additionally observed that the relationship of BMI , waist - to - hip circumference ratio and triglycerides with PA changed over the study period . Further analy - ses suggested that the interaction with survey year re ﬂ ected an im - provement in PA level among participants with diabetes , high BMI , waist - to - hip circumference ratio , or triglycerides in years in the period after 2006 compared to the period before 2006 . This suggests that PA also increased among participants with cardiovascular disease risk fac - tors , suggestingaspeci ﬁ ceffectofthecampaignsonapopulationatrisk . In agreement with the literature we found that female sex was associated with lower levels of PA ( Bauman et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , we found that the trend for increased PA was more pronounced in women than in men . It is therefore possible that the sex difference in PA is decreasing . In a recent comprehensive review education was identi ﬁ ed either as uncorrelated with PA or as a positive correlate of PA but not a determi - nant ( Bauman et al . , 2012 ) . We found that weekly minutes spent in 3 + METs was associated with education and job position ; participants with lower education or job position had higher PA compared to partici - pants with higher education or job position . Similar results were found whenanalyzingotherPAindicatorssuchasdailytotalEElevels . However , education was no longer associated with PA indicators after further ad - justment for professional occupation , while blue - collar type occupation remained associated with higher PA independently of education . This suggests that profession type and not education is correlated with PA . There were no trends over the 10 - year period . Limitations and strengths Even though PAFQ questionnaire was validated with objective mea - suresitremainsasourceofbias . PAlevelcategories ( e . g . MVPA ) arenor - mally derived from objectively measured PA with accelerometers using published cut - offs for counts / min . Our method , questionnaire , was fundamentally different , and any comparison of absolute values of PA indicators between studies using different methods is problematic . In addition , one cannot exclude that health promotion campaigns induced a tendency for socially desirable answers . Data in 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 should be interpreted with some further caution , as smallernumbers of participants were included during these years . To account for this , we conducted additional analyses com - bining years 2005 to 2008 and observed similar results . In addition , the trends were con ﬁ rmed in 2009 , which included a larger number of par - ticipants . Some prevalence and levels of attributes of PA ( e . g . , smoking status ) varied across survey years and this could potentially in ﬂ uence PA trends . We therefore ran additional models adjusting for these attri - butes when they presented signi ﬁ cant changes . The cross - sectional nature of the ‘ Bus Santé ’ study precludes us determining the temporality between changes in physical activity and changes in cholesterol or glucose levels , rates of obesity , diabetes or hypertension , if any ( Guessous et al . , 2012 ) . The clinical signi ﬁ cance of the changes in PA is therefore dif ﬁ cult to determine . The ‘ Bus Santé ’ study pre hoc decision to include only subjects aged 35 to 74 years old – in order to include the adult population most at risk for chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease and cancers – limits the interpre - tation of our results to this age range . Strengths of the study are the number of subjects ( N 9000 ) , the representative sampling , the low attrition , the inclusion of objective measures and yearly cohorts , excluding bias from aging . The PAFQ was validated against heart rate calibrated with indirect calorimetry with reasonable accuracy and precision ( Bernstein et al . , 1998 ) . The use of more than 20 years of the same validated questionnaire allows the study of trends over long periods . Conclusions Our analysis of PA levels in adults in an urban state in Switzerland from 1999 to 2009 indicates a trend for increased population PA . The ﬁ ndings are encouraging but since the observed increases are shallow thereisneedtopursueeffortstofurtherincreasepopulationlevelsofPA .
