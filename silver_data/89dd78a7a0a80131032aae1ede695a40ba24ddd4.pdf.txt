Scholars have argued that remote associates problems and insight problems share similar core processes . However , there is little empirical evidence for their similarities . The main purpose of this study is to examine the applicability of Representational Change Theory ( an insight theory ) for remote associates problem - solving . This study manipulated the occurrence position of the keyword of a remote associates problem to alter the constraint relaxation in the problem . The problems were divided into three kinds , namely Keyword - in - Front ( KF ) , Keyword - in - Middle ( KM ) , and Keyword - in - Back ( KB ) problems . Individuals ' eye movements were recorded during problem - solving . The results indicate that the solution rates of KM problems are higher than that of KB problems . Further , when individuals solved KF or KB problems , they had more regression counts and spent longer dwell time on the ﬁ xation region than on the key region . However , more time was spent on the key region as well as more regression counts when one was solving KM problems than the other two problems . The results of this study support the applicability of Representational Change Theory in the solving process of remote associates problems . 1 . Introduction During the formation of creative ideas , two things that are seemingly irrelevant are often combined to produce practical and valuable concepts and products . Mednick ( 1962 ) put forward the associative theory to explain the process that one associates remote concepts to meet special needs or achieve certain purposes . Further , Mednick ( 1962 , 1968 ) designed remote associates problems to measure the individual ability of remote association and creative potential . Nowadays , there are still many scholars using remote associates problems in related researches to evaluate one ’ s creativity ( e . g . Brodt , Pöhlchen , Täumer , Gais , & Schönauer , 2018 ; Colzato , de Haan , & Hommel , 2015 ; Cranford & Moss , 2012 ; Huang , 2018 ; Lin & Shih , 2016 ; Wu , Chang , & Chen , 2017 ) . Some scholars believe that remote associates problems and insight problems are of the same type since they share similar characteristics of creative problems . They both have limited solution , belong to convergent problems , and involve the individual ability of convergent thinking ( Brophy , 2000 ; Colzato et al . , 2015 ; Hommel , 2012 ; Ritter , Abbing , & Van Schie , 2018 ; Shen , Hommel , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . tsc . 2018 . 12 . 001 Received 30 August 2018 ; Received in revised form 1 December 2018 ; Accepted 1 December 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author at : Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology , No . 43 , Keelung Rd . , Sec . 4 , Da ' an Dist . , Taipei City 10607 , Taiwan , ROC .

The comparison between remote associates problems and insight problems can be seen mostly on theoretical statements ( Ben - Zur , 1989 ; Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a , 2003b ; Lubart , 1994 ) , or through evidences from correla - tional studies ( Ansburg , 2000 ; Huang , Chen , & Liu , 2012 ; Lee , Huggins , & Therriault , 2014 ; Schooler & Melcher , 1995 ) . There is insu ﬃ cient direct evidence that demonstrates the similarities in the solving processes of these two creative problems . If the two creative problems share similar problem - solving processes , then , the theory used to explain insight problem - solving , such as Re - presentational Change Theory , should be able to e ﬀ ectively explain and predict remote associates problem - solving . In recent years , along with the development of eye tracking technology , eye tracker has been widely used to explore the cognitive thinking process , especially the solving process of general or insight problems ( Chen , Peng , Tseng , & Chiou , 2008 ; Grant & Spivey , 2003 ; Jones , 2003 ; Knoblich , Ohlsson , & Raney , 2001 ; Ming , Tong , Yang , Qiu , & Zhang , 2014 ; Tseng , Chen , Chen , Sung , & Chang , 2014 ) . This study , therefore , aims to examine whether the Representational Change Theory is applicable to remote associates problem - solving . In - dicators for eye movements will be used as evidence for the similarities and di ﬀ erences between these two creative problems . 1 . 1 . Theoretical basis of remote associates problems According to the associative theory , Mednick ( 1962 ) de ﬁ ned creativity as a process during which one associates seemingly irrelevant or remotely related concepts for special needs or purposes . The inspiration and creation of many concepts and products are achieved by way of remote association . However , not everyone can e ﬀ ectively form a remote association and achieve a creative response . Each individual owns di ﬀ erent knowledge structure , di ﬀ ers in the number of conceptual association , has diverse cognition or personality style , and chooses di ﬀ erent associative responses . Thus , the creativity of the products di ﬀ ers from one to another ( Mednick , 1962 ) . 1 . 2 . Remote associates problem The associative theory provides a new theoretical direction for research studies on creativity . Mednick ( 1962 , 1968 ) compiled 60 remote associates problems based on associative theory , which constitute two forms of remote associates tests ( RAT ) , each consists of 30 problems . Every problem includes three words ( e . g . , “ same , head , tennis ” ) . The participants are asked to ﬁ nd out the target word related to the three words ( the solution for the example is “ match ” ) . The number of correct responses for the 30 problems represents one ’ s ability of remote association . The reliability and validity of the scoring have been well established ( Datta , 1964 ; Mednick , 1963 ) . Furthermore , several researchers have compiled di ﬀ erent forms and languages of remote associates problems according to their research purposes ( e . g . Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a ; Chermahini , Hickendor ﬀ , & Hommel , 2012 ; Huang , 2014 ; Huang et al . , 2012 ; Sio & Rudowicz , 2007 ; Wu & Chen , 2017 ) . Although the concept of remote association , as well as its corresponding measurement , has been constantly being developed since 1962 . The remote associates problems are still being used widely as a measurement of creative potential and creative ability due to the advantages of brief implement time , easy to carry out , limited correct responses , and objective scoring . Also , researchers can choose the level of di ﬃ culty of the remote associates problems based on the characteristics of the individuals or the speci ﬁ c needs of the studies ( e . g . Colzato et al . , 2015 ; Cranford & Moss , 2012 ; Lin & Shih , 2016 ) . Above all , it could indicate the signi ﬁ cance and importance of the remote associates problems on the creativity studies . 1 . 3 . The solving processes of remote associates problems and insight problems Insight problems and remote associates problems are categorized as close - ended creative problems ( Wake ﬁ eld , 1992 ) and are regarded as a measurement of convergent thinking abilities since both have a limited solution ( e . g . , Brophy , 2000 ; Colzato et al . , 2015 ; Hommel , 2012 ) . This study attempts to compare the similarities of these two problems by examining whether the theory for insight problems is applicable to the processes of remote associates problems . It is , therefore , necessary to introduce the theory about insight problems ﬁ rst before comparison . 1 . 3 . 1 . Insight problem and insight theory Creativity is explained from the perspective of “ insight ” in Gestalt , stating that insight is a process during which one “ suddenly perceives useful or appropriate relationship ” ( Kohler , 1929 ) . Individuals are unable to explain the process during which one suddenly perceives the solution ( Metcalfe , 1986 ) and often accompanies with an “ Aha ! ” experience ( Ohlsson , 1984 ) . Further , Mayer ( 1995 ) proposed that insight can be produced by reorganizing information , reconstructing problems or removing the dominant but in - appropriate knowledge and experience . Sternberg and Davidson ( 1995 ) believed that insight is often produced by selectively en - coding ( activating the information related to the problems ) , comparison ( comparing the relatedness of existing knowledge and problems ) or combination ( combing the information that seems irrelevant ) from the new perspective . Many researchers have put forward the properties that are essential to an insight problem based on their de ﬁ nitions of “ insight ” , including impasses encounter and “ Aha ! ” experiences . Firstly , in the initial of solving insight problems , the dominant representation which activated by the individual often misleads to the wrong direction , which results in impasses and not getting the correct answers ( Dominowski & Dallob , 1995 ; Kaplan & Simon , 1990 ; Schooler , Ohlsson , & Brooks , 1993 ) . Secondly , when one jumps out of the dominant knowledge or representations of the problem , the answers appear and accompanied by an “ Aha ! ” experience ( Schooler et al . , 1993 ) . In brief , one often misleads by a wrong knowledge representation or strategy at the beginning of problem - solving , for which an impasse is encountered , but has no clue on how to solve the problem . After some time of incubation , the impasse is broken , P . - S . Huang et al . Thinking Skills and Creativity 31 ( 2019 ) 198 – 208 199 and the solution is realized with an “ Aha ! ” experience . Some scholars propose the Representational Change Theory in explaining the processes of insight problems ( Knoblich , Ohlsson , Haider , & Rhenius , 1999 , 2001 ; Ohlsson , 1992 ) . According to the theory , individuals fail to solve the problem when they activate the dominant knowledge or representation of the problem . If they continue solving the problem with this representation , they will run into an impasse . Only when the individuals alter their activated representation or knowledge to the correct one , the problems will be solved and insight occurs . Knoblich et al . ( 1999 ) ; Knoblich et al . , 2001 further mentioned that dominant representation can be changed through the process of constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition . Constraint relaxation refers to the reduction of unnecessary and unrelated activation , while chunk decomposition means the decomposing of knowledge or concepts into meaningful units , such as breaking down a phone number into single ﬁ gures . The viewpoints of Representational Change Theory have supported by many empirical evidence using di ﬀ erent types of insight problems ( Öllinger , Jones , & Knoblich , 2013 ; Jones , 2003 ; Knoblich et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; Ohlsson , 1992 ; Öllinger , Jones , & Knoblich , 2006 ; Tseng et al . , 2014 ) . In a research by Knoblich et al . ( 1999 ) , four di ﬀ erent types of matchstick problems were used to examine the e ﬀ ect of constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition on insight . Each of the problems required the participants to move only one matchstick ( but not to remove it ) to make the equation correct . ( 1 ) Type A problem involves value constraint ( numeral movement only ) and loose chucks . For instance , to solve the matchstick problem of “ VI = VII + I ” , only one matchstick of the numeral “ VII ” is needed to be moved to the numeral “ VI ” to form the correct equation of “ VII = VI + I ” . Only the value ( “ VII ” and “ VI ” ) is needed to be changed and the combination of numerals is relatively loose . ( 2 ) Type B problem involves value and operator constraints as well as relative intermediate chunks . For example , to solve the problem of “ I = II + II ” , one matchstick from the operator “ + ” is needed to be moved to the ﬁ rst numeral “ II ” to form the correct equation of “ I = III － II ” . The value and operator are needed to be changed and the decomposition of Type B problem is relatively more di ﬃ cult than Type A problem . ( 3 ) Type C problem involves operator and tautology constraints as well as intermediate chunks . Take the matchstick problem of “ III = III + III ” for example , one of the matchsticks from the plus sign “ + ” needs to be rotated to make it an equal sign “ = ” to form the correct equation of “ III = III = III ” . The operator and tautology are needed to be changed and the decomposition of plus sign is also relatively more di ﬃ cult than Type A problem . ( 4 ) Type D problem involves only value constraint but tighter chunk . In solving the problem of “ XI = III + III ” , one of the matchsticks from the numeral “ XI ” needs to be moved to becoming the numeral “ VI ” to form the correct equation of “ VI = III + III ” . Only the value is needed to be changed but the chunk of numeral “ XI ” is tighter and the decomposition is more di ﬃ cult than three other problems . The results indicated that the solution rate of Type A problem ( single constraint ) is higher than those of Type B and C problems ( both involve two constraints ) , which reveals the impact of the constraint relaxation on insight . Moreover , the solution rate of Type A problem ( loose chunk ) is signi ﬁ cantly higher than that of Type D problem ( tighter chunk ) , which supported that the in ﬂ uence of chunk decomposition on insight . Both results show evidence of changing representation through constraint relaxation or chunk decomposition would help solvers overcoming impasses and gain the insight . 1 . 3 . 2 . The comparison of insight and remote associates problem - solving Some scholars claim that remote associates problems and insight problems share similar problem - solving processes . Bowden and Jung - Beeman ( 2003a ) analyzed the solving process of remote associates problems and found that , ﬁ rst , both problems will mislead the individual with dominant yet wrong representations . During the solving process of remote associates problems , one often gets stuck in the easy retrieval responses and fails to get the solution . Novel and remote ideas need to be connected to solve the problem . Second , individuals are often unable to state the process of problem - solving ( Ben - Zur , 1989 ) . Third , “ Aha ! ” experience appears after solving the problem ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003b ) . Moreover , Mednick ( 1962 ) proposed the concept of Associative Hierarchy to explain individual di ﬀ erences in the performance of creativity . Individuals with steep associative hierarchy tend to form strong associations among closely related concepts and are less likely to link remotely concepts , further result in poor performance in creativity . For those with ﬂ at associative hierarchy , they can not only associate closely related concepts but also remotely non - dominant concepts . Therefore , they are more likely to be creative . In other words , closely related concepts are retrieved sponta - neously by individuals with steep and ﬂ at associative hierarchy , mislead them to inappropriate knowledge representation and fail to solve the remote associates problems . However , those with ﬂ at associative hierarchy can eliminate the in ﬂ uence of dominant con - cepts by associating remotely related concepts and are more likely to produce creative ideas . But for those with steep associative hierarchy are less likely to retrieve remotely related concepts . In brief , the spontaneous association of closely dominant concepts will lead individuals to an impasse , which prevents them from solving the problem . For those with ﬂ at associative hierarchy , they will be able to produce creative ideas by changing the representation and associating with remote concepts . In addition , Lubart ( 1994 ) pointed out that among the three ways of insight proposed by Sternberg and Davidson ( 1995 ) , the selective combination is con - ceptually similar with remote association . Both describe the process of combining diverse concepts . As for empirical evidence , many correlational studies have found signi ﬁ cant positive relationships between remote associates problems and insight problems ( Ansburg , 2000 ; Huang et al . , 2012 ; Lee et al . , 2014 ; Schooler & Melcher , 1995 ) . Huang ( 2017 ) further recorded and analyzed the eye movements of individuals when they solved remote associates problems , the results found that the eye movements are similar to those in insight problem - solving and supported the viewpoints of Representational Change Theory . Like insight problem , the solving process of remote associates problem will also experience the insight process of encountering impasses and escaping ﬁ xation . However , as Huang ' s research does not involve experimental manipulation , it only records the process of solving remote associates problems of individuals , so it is susceptible to be a ﬀ ected by the characteristics of remote associates problems . In addition , according to Representational Change Theory , problem solvers can change their representation and attain insight by the mechanism of constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . However , the results of Huang ' s research cannot provide the mechanism evidence of how problem solvers change their representation . Because Huang ’ s P . - S . Huang et al . Thinking Skills and Creativity 31 ( 2019 ) 198 – 208 200 research is insu ﬃ cient for the interpretation of representational change mechanism , this study further overcomes the inferential restriction in Huang ' s study by manipulating the position of keyword of remote associates problems , and alters the constraint of the problem to test whether the individual can change the representation through the mechanism of constraint relaxation , so as to gain insight . Since the eye tracker is widely used in the research of insight and remote associates problems ( Chen et al . , 2008 ; Huang , 2017 ; Jones , 2003 ; Knoblich et al . , 2001 ; Ming et al . , 2014 ; Tseng et al . , 2014 ) to e ﬀ ectively re ﬂ ect the possible problem - solving process . The dwell time and regression count are two signi ﬁ cant eye movement indicators ( Chen , Lai , & Chiu , 2010 ; Duchowski , 2007 ; Rayner , 2009 ; Underwood , 2005 ) . The dwell time in a particular region represents the time needed to comprehend the information on this region and re ﬂ ects the importance of this information in reading or problem - solving , thus attracting individuals ’ attention . While regression count represents the reexamination and re - reading of the previously processed information , re ﬂ ecting that the information in this region may be an important key to comprehend the text . Or when the working memory span is unable to contain all the information , individuals will have more regression and re - reading of information in this region . Given that the eye movement indicator can e ﬀ ectively re ﬂ ect individuals ’ problem - solving process , especially in dwell time and regression count , it represents the attention and processing of the individual to the key information . Therefore , in addition to collecting the solution rates of the individual ' s response to the remote associates problems , this study also recorded the eye movements of the individual when solving the problem , as a representative indicator of the problem - solving process . 2 . Predictions of this study From the theoretical perspective and correlational evidence , remote associates problems and insight problems are regarded as the same type of creative problem and share similar process of problem - solving ( Ben - Zur , 1989 ; Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a , 2003b ; Lubart , 1994 ) . However , except for the study of Huang ( 2017 ) , few have provided direct evidence to compare the solving process of the two problems . This study aims to examine the applicability of Representational Change Theory ( which used to explain the insight process ) for remote associates problem - solving . According to the theory , individuals can change representations through constraint relaxation or chunk decomposition ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . Thus , we attempt to examine the in ﬂ uence of constraint relaxation on problem - solving by manipulating the occurrence position of keyword in remote associates problems . By altering the position of keyword will enable the individual to reduce the probability of activating irrelevant knowledge and remove the constraint of concept associations , further a ﬀ ect their solving process . In recent years , many empirical studies on problem - solving have con ﬁ rmed that eye movements can e ﬀ ectively re ﬂ ect one ’ s cognitive solving process and provide more precise indicators other than behavior data ( Chen et al . , 2008 ; Grant & Spivey , 2003 ; Jones , 2003 ; Knoblich et al . , 2001 ; Ming et al . , 2014 ; Tseng et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , in this study , not only the behavior data of the solution rate but also the corresponding eye movements will both be recorded while participants are solving remote associates problems . This study adopted remote associates problems ( for instance , “ doctor , nurse , tour guide ” ) compiled and adopted by Huang ( 2014 , 2017 ) . The ﬁ rst two words of each problem ( “ doctor , nurse ” ) are ﬁ xation words , which belong to the same conceptual category . They tend to lead individuals to stick to the associations of the conceptual category ( the ﬁ rst associations that they form are all related to hospitals in this case ) and encounter an impasse . Individuals who can escape the ﬁ xation of the conceptual category and form associations with the third word ( “ tour guide ” in this case ; the third word di ﬀ ers from the ﬁ rst two words in conceptual category and it is the keyword for solving the problem ) will successfully solve the problem . Through the change of concept representations , the insight will emerge . If the position of keyword is changed and it is put in the middle of the two ﬁ xation words ( Keyword - in - Middle , KM ) ( “ doctor , tour guide , nurse ” in this case ) , individuals will be less likely to be in ﬂ uenced by the concepts of the same category . Instead , they are more likely to ﬁ nd out the association between “ doctor ” and “ tour guide ” . Therefore , they will have a higher possibility of solving the problem successfully . Conversely , if the ﬁ xation words appear one after another , either in the context of Keyword - in - Back ( KB , “ doctor , nurse , tour guide ” in this case ) or in the context of Keyword - in - Front , ( KF , “ tour guide , doctor , nurse ” in this example ) , the individual will have a higher chance of getting stuck in the association around the concepts of the same category ; hence , encounter an impasse and have a lower possibility of solving the problem . This study predicts that ( 1 ) as for the solution rate , placing the keyword between the two ﬁ xation words ( KM problems ) will decrease the chance that individuals encounter an impasse which occurs when two ﬁ xation words appear one after another ( KF or KB problems ) . The KM problems will decrease the constraint on associations , and reduce the probability of activating irrelevant knowledge . Thus , the solution rate of KM problems will improve compared to KF and KB problems ( Hypothesis 1 – 1 ) . As for the eye movements , this study predicts that ( 2 ) keyword of remote associates problems appearing in di ﬀ erent positions will exert an impact on the regression counts ( Hypothesis 1 – 2 ) and on the ﬁ xation time ( Hypothesis 1 – 3 ) of an individual for keyword and ﬁ xation words . If the keyword is positioned between the two ﬁ xation words ( KM problems ) , the individual is less likely to be in ﬂ uenced by ﬁ xation words which will reduce the chances of encountering an impasse . During this process , the regression count for ﬁ xation words will be less than that for the keyword ( Hypothesis 1 – 2a ) ; the percentage of dwell time for ﬁ xation words will be shorter than that for the keyword ( Hypothesis 1 – 3a ) . If the ﬁ xation words in the problem appear one after the other ( KF or KB problems ) , the individual will be more likely in ﬂ uenced by the ﬁ xation words that appear in succession . Fixation words will be checked repeatedly . Therefore , it is predicted that the times of checking ﬁ xation words will be more than that of the keyword ( Hypothesis 1 – 2b ) , and the percentage of dwell time for ﬁ xation words will be longer than that for keyword ( Hypothesis 1 – 3b ) . P . - S . Huang et al . Thinking Skills and Creativity 31 ( 2019 ) 198 – 208 201 3 . Methods 3 . 1 . Participants In this study , 58 college students ( 28 males , 30 females ) with normal vision ( with or without correction ) participated in the study . Their average age is 26 . 03 with a standard deviation of 6 . 10 . They were invited to solve 12 remote associates problems during which , their eye movements were recorded in a dynamic , natural , and undisturbed manner . 3 . 2 . Design The experiment adopted a 2 × 2 × 3 mixed factorial design with three independent variables . The performance variable is a between - subject variable , consisted of a high and low performance group , which were divided according to the mean ( M = 0 . 63 ) of the solution rate for the 12 remote associates problems . The region variable was divided into ﬁ xation region and key region , de - pending on whether the words in the problem are ﬁ xation words or keyword . The keyword position variable was divided into Keyword - in - Front ( KF ) , Keyword - in - Middle ( KM ) , and Keyword - in - Back ( KB ) problems based on the location of the keyword in the problem . The last two are within - subject variables . The dependent variables are the indicators for the solution rate and eye move - ments , including dwell time ( in seconds ) , ﬁ xation time , ﬁ xation duration ( in millisecond ) , regression counts , and percentage of dwell time . 3 . 3 . Materials and apparatus 3 . 3 . 1 . Remote associates problems The experiment adopted the 12 remote associates problems formulated and used by Huang ( 2014 , 2017 ) . Each problem consisted of three words as stimuli ( such as “ doctor , nurse , tour guide ” ) , two of which belong to the same conceptual category ( “ doctor ” and “ nurse ” are all related to hospitals ) which will lead the participants to associate with a particular conceptual category ( such as “ hospital , operation , surgery , medical treatment … ” ) during problem - solving . Participants who continue to form associations with the two words of the same conceptual category will eventually fall into a ﬁ xation , encounter an impasse , then resulting in failure to solve the problem ( the answer is “ profession ” or “ expertise ” ) . The two words that often lead participants to a ﬁ xation are de ﬁ ned as “ ﬁ xation region ” , as shown in Fig . 1 . On the other , the third word in the problem belongs to a di ﬀ erent conceptual category . During the process of problem - solving , participants need to get out of the conceptual category of the ﬁ xation words and form an association with the keyword . This will decide whether the participant could escape the ﬁ xation and solve the problem successfully . Therefore , the keyword is de ﬁ ned as “ key region ” . The purpose of this experiment is to test whether Representational Change Theory can be used to explain the process of solving remote associates problems . The e ﬀ ect of constraint relaxation on problem - solving was manipulated by the position of keyword , and how it exerts an impact on the solution rate and eye movements was observed . During the manipulation of keyword position variable , the keyword was positioned in either KF ( such as “ tour guide , doctor , nurse ” ) , KM ( such as “ doctor , tour guide , nurse ” ) , or KB ( such as “ doctor , nurse , tour guide ” ) problems . The varying position was done to in ﬂ uence the way participants form the conceptual asso - ciation , and hence to a ﬀ ect the possibility of getting stuck in an impasse . Four out of the 12 problems were selected at random to constitute KF , KM , or KB problems . Each participant completed 12 problems , four KF , four KM , and four KB problems . All problems were presented at random in the Experiment - Builder software . In order to further compare participants ’ eye movements from ﬁ xation words and keyword , an AOI ( Area of Interest ) for the three words was drawn within a 200 × 100 pixel square to de ﬁ ne the region variable . Since there were two ﬁ xation words in the problems used in this experiment , the average of the eye movement indexes for the regions of the two ﬁ xation words were used to represent individual eye movement indicator for the ﬁ xation region . In this way , the di ﬀ erence in the size of the area was avoided to prevent its in ﬂ uence on the analysis of the eye movement indexes . 3 . 3 . 2 . Eye - tracking system During the experiment , an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker ( SR Research , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ) with a Dell OptiPlex Gx620 computer , and a Chimei 19PS monitor were used to record experimental data . The Eyelink 1000 eye tracker uses a pupil - cornea eye tracking method to record the position where the eye ﬁ xes on the screen by tracking eye movement . The sampling rate was set at 1000 Hz , which means that the sampling was at 1000 times per second . The resolution was set at 0 . 01° . The delay time for the access to the eye position data was 2 msec . The average position error of ﬁ xation was 0 . 15° ( less than the general error by 0 . 25° to 0 . 5° ) . In this experiment , the participants viewed the problems in the screen using both eyes at the same time . Since the simultaneous Fig . 1 . An Example of Keyword - in - Back Remote Associates Problem from Huang ( 2017 ) . Notes : The translations of the words are “ doctor ” , “ nurse , ” and “ tour guide ” sequentially . Squares with dotted lines represent the ﬁ xation region ; the square with solid lines , represent the key region . P . - S . Huang et al . Thinking Skills and Creativity 31 ( 2019 ) 198 – 208 202 recording of two eyes probably leads the left and right eyes to be less focused , only monocular eye movements were recorded . The system was mainly set to record the eye movements of the right eye . Only when the right eye could not be pinpointed by the device , was the movements of the left eye recorded . 3 . 4 . Procedure The experiment was conducted individually . Before the formal phase of the study , participants were asked to sit about 80 cm away from a 19 - inch screen on which remote associates problems were displayed . A straight line is formed from the center of the screen to the participants ’ eyes . The participant was asked to put his chin on the head support of the eye tracker . After , the examiner adjusted the micro - camera to its proper position and recorded the movement of the right eye at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz . Next , a nine - point Calibration Test was conducted . They were asked to ﬁ x their gaze at the black spots that appear at di ﬀ erent positions on the screen to calculate the values of the pupil - cornea position to that of the visual material . If the participant passed the Calibration Test , the Validation Test will then be performed using the same procedure to check the consistency with the previous calibration test . After con ﬁ rming that the eye - tracking device could accurately record the eye movements of the participants , the examiner started the practice phase . The purpose of the practice phase was mainly allowing participants to be familiar with the procedures . Displayed on the screen were four remote associates problems randomly presented . Participants were asked to press the spacebar and to verbalize their response once they thought of the answer . The experimenter will judge its correctness based on the response provided by the participants . If the answer was correct , they would proceed to the next problem ; if the answer was incorrect , they would return to the previous problem to try to solve it again . The maximum allowable time to solve a problem was 3 min . When the time was up , participants would have the chance to report their response again before they went on to solve the next one . Con ﬁ rming that participants had no problem with the procedure , the formal experiment was started . They were asked to solve 12 remote associates problems using the same procedures as that of the practice phase . The entire experiment took 40 – 50 minutes . After the experiment , the research purpose and procedure were introduced , each of the participants was given 200 New Taiwan Dollars as a token of gratitude for their participation . 4 . Results Among the 58 participants , the eye movements data of 7 participants were deleted because of high calibration errors . The data of 51 participants were analyzed in total . 4 . 1 . The solution rate of remote associates problems with di ﬀ erent keyword positions The result of one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) showed that the variables of keyword position had a marginal e ﬀ ect , F ( 2 , 100 ) = 2 . 46 , p = 0 . 091 , MSE = 0 . 054 , and ɳ p ² = 0 . 047 . The Post hoc results revealed that the average solution rate for KM problems ( M = 0 . 67 , SD = 0 . 23 ) is signi ﬁ cantly higher than that for KB problems ( M = 0 . 57 , SD = 0 . 30 ) . There is no di ﬀ erence between KF problems ( M = 0 . 64 , SD = 0 . 24 ) and the other two types of problems ( as Table 1 ) . 4 . 2 . Dwell time , ﬁ xation times , and average ﬁ xation duration for remote associates problem - solving One - way ANOVA was conducted , with the keyword position as the independent variable , and dwell time , ﬁ xation times , and average ﬁ xation duration as the dependent variables . The results show that there is no signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erence among the dwell time for three di ﬀ erent types of problems , F ( 2 , 100 ) = 1 . 16 , p > 0 . 05 , and MSE = 1373 . 08 . In addition , the keyword position variable has no main e ﬀ ect on ﬁ xation times [ F ( 2100 ) = 1 . 35 , p > 0 . 05 , and MSE = 7824 . 67 ] and on average ﬁ xation duration [ F ( 2 , 100 ) = 1 . 72 , p > 0 . 05 , and MSE = 0 . 288 ] . This means that the position of keyword does not exert an impact on dwell time , ﬁ xation times and average ﬁ xation duration during the process in which the participants solved the problems .

The regression counts in di ﬀ erent AOIs of remote associates problems A three - way ANOVA was conducted with the performance , keyword position and region variables as independent variables and the regression counts as the dependent variable . The related descriptive statistics are shown in Table 2 . The results reveal that there is a three - way interaction e ﬀ ect ( as Table 4 ) , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 5 . 67 , p < 0 . 05 , MSE = 18 . 33 , and ɳ p ² = 0 . 104 . Furthermore , as shown in Fig . 2a , results of the simple interaction e ﬀ ect indicate that for the low performance group , there is an interaction e ﬀ ect between the keyword position and region variables , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 106 . 06 , p < 0 . 05 , and MSE = 18 . 33 . The regression counts of problem solvers for the words in the ﬁ xation region ( M s = 36 . 03 , 44 . 69 ) are greater than that for the words in the key region ( M s = 29 . 59 , 34 . 72 ) when they solved KF and KB problems , F s ( 1 , 49 ) = 28 . 25 , 108 . 51 , p s < 0 . 05 . However , in the process of solving KM problems , the regression counts of the participants for the words in the key region ( M = 40 . 10 ) are greater than those for the words in the ﬁ xation region ( M = 25 . 49 ) , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 111 . 62 , and p < 0 . 05 . On the other , for the words in the key region , the regression counts during KM problem - solving are greater than those during KF problem - solving , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 3 . 91 , and p < 0 . 05 . For words in the ﬁ xation region , the regression counts during KB problem - solving is greater than KF problems , both are also greater than KM problems , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 17 . 51 , and p < 0 . 05 . For high performance group , there is also an interaction e ﬀ ect between the keyword position and the region variables , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 67 . 89 , p < 0 . 05 , and MSE = 18 . 33 . Further tests for the simple interaction e ﬀ ect show that the regression counts for the words in the ﬁ xation region ( M s = 26 . 94 , 22 . 13 ) are greater than those for the words in the key region ( M s = 22 . 30 , 16 . 04 ) in solving KF and KB problems , F s ( 1 , 49 ) = 19 . 29 , 53 . 28 , and p s < 0 . 05 . In solving KM problem , the regression counts for the words in the key region ( M = 29 . 41 ) are greater than those for the words in the ﬁ xation region ( M = 18 . 77 ) , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 77 . 90 , and p < 0 . 05 . On the other , for the words in the key region , the regression counts during KM problem - solving are greater than those during KF and KB problem - solving , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 8 . 35 , p < 0 . 05 . For the words in the ﬁ xation region , the regression counts during KF problem - solving are greater than those during KM problem - solving , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 4 . 21 , p < 0 . 05 . It is worth mentioning that although the trends of interaction between the high performance group and the low performance group at the keyword position and region variables are the same , the di ﬀ erence in the low performance group is more signi ﬁ cant . In addition , the performance variable exerted a main e ﬀ ect , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 28 . 85 , p < 0 . 05 , MSE = 406 . 87 , and ɳ p ² = . 371 . The low performance group ( M = 35 . 10 ) has a signi ﬁ cantly greater regression counts than the high performance group ( M = 22 . 60 ) . However , neither the keyword position variable ( F = 0 . 095 , p > 0 . 05 ) nor the region variable ( F = 0 . 70 , p > 0 . 05 ) has any main e ﬀ ect .

The percentage of dwell time in di ﬀ erent AOIs of remote associates problems A three - way ANOVA was conducted with the performance , keyword position , and region variables as the independent variables , and the percentage of dwell time as the dependent variable . The results showed that the three - way interaction e ﬀ ect is not signi ﬁ cant , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 1 . 87 , p > 0 . 05 , MSE = 0 . 006 . Further , the interaction e ﬀ ect between the performance and region variables is not signi ﬁ cant , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 1 . 89 , p > 0 . 05 , MSE = 0 . 004 . Nor is the interaction e ﬀ ect between the performance and keyword position variables , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 0 . 18 , p > 0 . 05 , MSE = 0 . 001 . Only the keyword position and region variables have an interaction e ﬀ ect , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 156 . 32 , p < 0 . 05 , MSE = 0 . 006 , and ɳ p ² = 0 . 761 . As shown in Fig . 3 , tests of simple main e ﬀ ect found that the region variable has a main e ﬀ ect for KF and KB problems , F s ( 1 , 49 ) = 4 . 27 , 29 . 92 , p s < 0 . 05 . The percentage of dwell time for words in the ﬁ xation region ( M s = 0 . 323 , 0 . 334 ) is signi ﬁ cant greater than that for the words in the key region ( M s = 0 . 295 , 0 . 259 ) . For KM problems , the region variable also exerted main e ﬀ ects , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 321 . 48 , p < 0 . 05 . The percentage of dwell time for the words in the key region ( M = 0 . 502 ) is greater than that in the ﬁ xation region ( M = 0 . 220 ) . On the other , for the words in the key region , the percentage of dwell time for KM problems is greater than that of KF and KB problems , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 159 . 22 , p < 0 . 05 . As for the words in the ﬁ xation region , the percentage of dwell time for KB and KF problems is greater than that of KM problems , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 134 . 94 , p < 0 . 05 . For the main e ﬀ ect , the keyword position variable revealed a signi ﬁ cant e ﬀ ect , F ( 2 , 98 ) = 138 . 17 , p < 0 . 05 , MSE = 0 . 001 , ɳ p ² = 0 . 738 . The percentage of dwell time for KM problems ( M = 0 . 361 ) is greater than that for KF problems ( M = 0 . 309 ) , and for KB problems ( M = 0 . 296 ) . The region variable also exerted a main e ﬀ ect , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 75 . 76 , p < 0 . 05 , MSE = 0 . 004 , and ɳ p ² = 0 . 607 . The percentage of dwell time for the words in the key region ( M = 0 . 352 ) is greater than that for the words in the ﬁ xation region ( M = 0 . 292 ) . The performance variable has no main e ﬀ ect , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 0 . 10 , p > 0 . 05 , MSE = 0 . 002 ( Table 3 ) . 5 . General discussion 5 . 1 . Implications of the present study According to previous literature , the remote associates problems and insight problems , which are both used to measure in - dividuals ' creative potential , share similar problem - solving processes ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003b ; Ben - Zur , 1989 ; Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a ; Lubart , 1994 ) . They are considered as the same type of creative problem ( Brophy , 2000 ; Colzato et al . , 2015 ; Hommel , 2012 ) . However , the arguments are mostly based on theoretical statements or empirical evidence of correlational studies ( e . g . , Ansburg , 2000 ; Huang et al . , 2012 ; Lee et al . , 2014 ; Schooler & Melcher , 1995 ) . Direct evidence of problem - solving process for the comparison between these two creative problems is still lacking . Accumulated evidence has supported that Representational Change Theory can e ﬀ ectively explain the solving process of insight problems ( 2013 , Jones , 2003 ; Knoblich et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; Ohlsson , 1992 ; Öllinger et al . , 2006 ; Tseng et al . , 2014 ) . According to the theory , when an individual starts solving insight problems , the dominant concept or representation will often be activated . However , Fig . 3 .

P . - S . Huang et al . Thinking Skills and Creativity 31 ( 2019 ) 198 – 208 205 it is not the key to solve the problem . If it is used continuously , it may lead to an impasse . Individuals can alter the activated representation through the use of constraint relaxation ( reducing activation of unrelated knowledge ) or chunk decomposition ( breaking knowledge or concepts into more meaningful units ) , further result in escaping ﬁ xation and successfully solving the problem ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . If remote associates problems and insight problems share similar problem - solving processes , then the Representational Change Theory that can e ﬀ ectively explain the process of insight should also be able to explain the process of solving remote associates problems . Although Huang ( 2017 ) research attempts to provide evidence of eye movements to re ﬂ ect the insight process of encountering impasses and escaping ﬁ xation in solving remote associates problem . Due to the fact that Huang ’ s study only recorded the eye movements of individuals , and did not involve any experimental manipulation of variables , it is sus - ceptible to be a ﬀ ected by the characteristics of remote associates problems . Also , it is di ﬃ cult to draw inferences about the me - chanism through which the individual can jump o ﬀ the ﬁ xation and attain insight . Therefore , more direct evidence is still needed to examine the internal mechanism of remote associates problem solving , as a basis for comparing the insight problem - solving . In this study , constraint relaxation of Representational Change Theory was manipulated by altering the occurrence position of keyword of remote associates problems to examine its e ﬀ ect on the participants ' solving process . We predicted that , relative to the problems which two ﬁ xation words appear one after another ( KF or KB problem ) , individuals will not get stuck in the ﬁ xation and the solution rate will be improved if the keyword of the problem is placed in the middle of the two ﬁ xation words ( KM problem ) . The results of present study did reveal that the solution rate of KM problems is higher than that of KB problems , but there is no di ﬀ erence with the KF problems . Hypothesis 1 - 1 has been partially supported . The ﬁ ndings are consistent with previous studies on insight problems ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) , and both support the viewpoints of Representational Change Theory . That is to say , the process of constraint relaxation not only e ﬀ ectively improves one ’ s performance of insight problems , but also improves the solution rate of the remote associates problems . It provides the empirical evidence for these two creative problems sharing similar problem - solving processes . It is worth mentioned that , although the solution rate of KF problems is relatively lower than KM problems , but no signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erence was found . We inferred that the possible reason might be that , the keyword appeared in the ﬁ rst place for KF problems , it may possibly reduce the in ﬂ uence of the two ﬁ xation words and resulting in a slight increase in their solution rates . In addition , this study also recorded participants ’ eye movements . The ﬁ ndings found that the position of keyword can a ﬀ ect the regression counts and viewing time for the words in the key region and ﬁ xation region . Hypotheses 1 – 2 and 1 – 3 are both supported by the results . When the keyword appeared in the middle of two ﬁ xation words ( KM problems ) , the regression counts ( Hypothesis 1 – 2a ) and percentage of dwell time ( Hypothesis 1 – 3a ) for the word in the key region were greater , which decreased the activation and ﬁ xation of irrelevant concepts . But if the two ﬁ xation words appear one after another ( KF or KB problems ) , the regression counts ( Hypothesis 1 – 2b ) and percentage of dwell time ( Hypothesis 1 – 3b ) for the words in the ﬁ xation region increased , which enhanced the possibility of irrelevant concept activation and stuck in ﬁ xation . It implies that to relax the constraint of the problems through altering the position of keyword will lower the in ﬂ uence of ﬁ xation words and e ﬀ ectively reduce the association of irrelevant words , further improve the solution rates of remote associates problems . In other words , the evidence from eye movements also supports that the process of constraint relaxation from Representational Change Theory can e ﬀ ectively explain the solving process of remote associates problems . Both the behavioral data for the solution rate and eye movement indicators support that Representational Change Theory can also be applied to the solving process of remote associates problems . The relaxation of constraint can e ﬀ ectively change the re - presentations activated by individuals and further increasing the possibility to solve the problems . 5 . 2 . Application and limitation Previous studies generally lack direct evidence on the comparison of solving process between remote associates problems and insight problems . By manipulating the position of keyword in problems , this study found that the constraint relaxation in Representational Change Theory also exerted an impact on solving performance and eye movements for remote associates problems . The ﬁ nding supports that Representational Change Theory can also be applied to explain the solving process of remote associates problems as well as insight problems . This study provides direct evidence for the solving process of remote associates problems and clari ﬁ es its relationship with insight problem - solving . In addition , di ﬀ erent from previous studies that only adopting the solution rate Table 4 The results of ANOVA on the Regression Counts and Percentage of Dwell Time in Performance , Keyword Position , and Region Variables .

P . - S . Huang et al . Thinking Skills and Creativity 31 ( 2019 ) 198 – 208 206 to examine the application of Representational Change Theory on insight process , this study additionally provided the re ﬁ ned evi - dence of eye movements for the solving process of remote associates problems . However , the remote associates problems used in this study belong to the problem with the forms of multiple association . Nowadays , some researchers adopt remote associates problems with a single association of compound word ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a ; Sio & Rudowicz , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2017 ) . Further studies are needed to explore the di ﬀ erence in the solving process between single and multiple association problems . Moreover , it is suggested that future studies investigate and compare the neural mechanism of solving remote associates problems and insight problems .
