We describe that the emergence of a new innovation system and changes in existing innovation systems co - evolve with the process of technological change . T herefore , it is necessary to create more insight in the dynamics of innovation systems . T raditional methods of innovation system analysis that mainly focus on the structure of innovation systems have proven to be insufficient . T herefore , we propose a framework that focuses on a number of processes that are highly important for well performing innovation systems . T hese processes are labeled as â€˜functions of innovation systemsâ€™ . After explaining this framework and embedding it in existing literature , we propose a method for systematically mapping those processes taking place in innovation systems and resulting in technological change . T his method can be characterized as a process analysis or history event analysis .
