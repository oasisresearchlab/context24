We show evidence that this symmetry breaking is based on the release of elastic energy , analogous to the fracture of polymer gels . The dynamics of this process and the thickness at which it occurs depend on the growth rate and mechanical properties of the actin gel . We explain our experimental results with a model based on elasticity theory and fracture mechanics . polymerization (cid:1) reconstituted motility medium (cid:1) gel fracture (cid:1) elasticity A ctin polymerization - based movement is a fascinating pro - cess in which monomer assembly at a surface generates the force that is necessary for displacement . This phenomenon drives lamellipodia protrusion in cells , where polymerization of actin is nucleated at the plasma membrane and modulated by crosslinking , capping , and depolymerizing proteins that are present in the cytoplasm . The actin machinery can be triggered by an external chemical signal , leading to cell polarization and directional movement . However , oriented displacement can also occur in the absence of external cues by spontaneous symmetry breaking ( 1 ) . Moreover , polarization followed by actin - based motility is displayed by simple objects like bacteria , liposomes , endosomes , soft droplets , or solid beads in cells or cytosol ( 2 – 4 ) . Understanding how directional movement arises in these sys - tems could lead to comprehension of how symmetry breaking occurs in cells . One broadly studied nucleator of actin polymerization is the Arp2 (cid:2) 3 complex that is activated near the plasma membrane by WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) family proteins ( 5 ) or near the surface of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes by the protein ActA ( 6 ) . When it is associated with an actin filament , activated Arp2 (cid:2) 3 complex nucleates a new filament by initiating a branch , thus organizing a dendritic actin network ( 7 ) . Capping proteins , actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) (cid:2) cofilin and profilin , regulate the rate of polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments and cooperate to ensure a high concentration of actin monomers ( 8 ) . Crosslinking proteins change the mechanical prop - erties of actin networks in vitro ( 9 – 13 ) and have an important role in motility ( for example , in the protrusion of filopodia ) ( 14 ) . The motility of Listeria can be reproduced in a medium contain - ing a minimum set of purified proteins that can also support the movement of solid beads coated with activating factors of actin polymerization ( 4 , 15 , 16 ) . Except in cases of preexisting asymme - try , the initial actin gel that grows around the beads is homogeneous and must undergo symmetry breaking to generate a comet that can push forward ( 3 , 4 , 17 – 19 ) . In this article , we examine how symmetry breaking arises on beads coated with verprolin (cid:2) cofilin (cid:2) acidic domain ( VCA ) ( an Arp2 (cid:2) 3 activator derived from WASP ) in a mix of commercially available proteins . We varied the com - position of the motility medium and added actin filament crosslink - ing agents to obtain a precise description of the physical and biochemical parameters that govern the growth of actin gels and the characteristics of symmetry breaking . We show experimental evi - dence that symmetry breaking occurs through a release of elastic energy in the actin gel , which can be triggered locally by disrupting the region of accumulated stress . This process is reminiscent of the fracture observed in brittle solids or gels . We propose a theoretical model based on elasticity and fracture mechanics to explain the experimental results . Materials and Methods Proteins . Actin , Arp2 (cid:2) 3 , gelsolin , ADF (cid:2) cofilin , profilin , (cid:1) - acti - nin , VCA , and biotinylated actin were purchased from Cytoskel - eton ( Denver ) , and used without further purification . Protein concentrations were determined by SDS (cid:2) PAGE using a BSA standard . Alexa Fluor 594 - and Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled actin were obtained from Molecular Probes , and streptavidin was obtained from Perbio Science ( Brebie ` res , France ) . Fascin was purified as described ( 20 ) . Human filamin A was a gift from Fumi Nakamura and Thomas Stossel ( Brigham and Women’s Hospi - tal , Boston ) . Bead Preparation . Polystyrene beads ( Polysciences ) with radii of 0 . 9 , 1 . 4 , 2 . 3 , 2 . 9 , 4 . 8 , and 7 . 9 (cid:2) m were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 (cid:2) M VCA solution at a total bead surface area of 15 m 2 (cid:2) liter that was kept constant when changing bead sizes . The density of VCA on the bead surface was estimated by measuring the VCA remain - ing in solution by a Bradford assay , and it was 0 . 10 (cid:1) 0 . 015 (cid:2) mol (cid:2) m 2 , corresponding to an average distance between VCA molecules of 4 . 0 (cid:1) 0 . 3 nm , similar to reported values ( 4 ) . By varying the VCA concentration in the incubation , we verified that this density corresponded to complete saturation of the bead surface . Beads were stored in a storage buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 (cid:2) 0 . 1 M KCl (cid:2) 1 mM MgCl 2 (cid:2) 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 (cid:2) 1 mg / ml BSA ) for up to 1 week at a total bead surface area of 15 m 2 (cid:2) liter . Gel Growth and Motility Assay . Unless otherwise indicated , the motility medium contained 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 15 mM CaCl 2 , 1 . 8 mM Mg (cid:1) ATP , 6 mM DTT , 0 . 13 mM diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ( Dabco ; an antiphotobleaching agent ) , 7 . 44 (cid:2) M F - actin ( 10 % labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor 488 for confocal microscopy ) , 0 . 05 (cid:2) M Arp2 (cid:2) 3 , 0 . 2 (cid:2) M gelsolin , 3 (cid:2) M ADF (cid:2) cofilin , 0 . 3 (cid:2) M profilin , and 10 mg (cid:2) ml BSA . At time 0 , a small volume of bead suspension was diluted 30 times in motility medium and mixed gently with a pipette . ( Note that the same results were obtained for twice the amount of beads . ) The sample was placed between a glass slide and coverslip ( 18 (cid:2) 18 mm ) sealed with Vaseline (cid:2) lanolin (cid:2) paraffin ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) . The total volume of sample was such that the spacing between slide and coverslip was at least three times the bead diameter ( 5 (cid:2) l for beads with radii of R (cid:3) 1 , 1 . 4 , and 2 . 3 (cid:2) m ; 6 (cid:2) l for beads with a radius of R (cid:3) 3 (cid:2) m ; 10 (cid:2) l for beads with a radius of R (cid:3) 5 (cid:2) m ; and 16 (cid:2) l for beads with a radius of R (cid:3) 8 (cid:2) m ) .

We either followed one single bead for a certain time or took pictures of many different , randomly chosen beads . Both methods gave the same results for the thickness as a function of time ( see Fig . 5 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Confocal microscopy experiments were carried out with a Zeiss confocal microscope with a (cid:2) 63 ( 1 . 40 numerical aperture ) oil - immersion objective and controlled by LSM 510 META software . Actin – Alexa Fluor 488 was observed with an ion – argon 25 - mW laser ( 488 nm ) . To limit convective flux , 0 . 5 – 1 (cid:2) M (cid:1) - actinin was added . Surface - rendered 3D reconstructions of confocal slices were performed by using VOLUMEJ software ( 21 ) with filtered images ( METAMORPH , Median Filter ) and enhanced contrast . Photo - damage was achieved by local illumination of a sample contain - ing 5 % Alexa Fluor 594 - labeled actin and 5 % Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled actin with a helium – neon 1 - mW laser ( 543 nm ) iterated 200 – 400 times ( corresponding to a few seconds ) . Results Growth and Symmetry Breaking of Actin Gels Around Spherical Beads . In motility medium , actin assembles at the surface of VCA - coated beads and pushes away the already assembled gel , as shown by two - color fluorescent marking ( see Fig . 6 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . First , the actin halo is spatially homogeneous , and its thickness grows with an initial rate of a few tenths of a micrometer per minute ( Fig . 1 a ) . Eventually , the spherical symmetry is broken ; a notch appears at the external surface of the actin gel ( arrow - head in Fig . 1 a ) , which grows inward and expands laterally with a velocity of a few micrometers per minute . As shown in Fig . 1 b , the shape of the hole in the gel is elongated rather than circular ( see Movies 1 – 3 , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , for other examples ) . After several minutes , the hole is big enough for the bead to escape from the gel , and the bead starts to move , trailing an actin comet ( Fig . 1 c ) . Strikingly , symmetry breaking can be triggered by a local dis - ruption of the actin gel . Taking advantage of our observation that Alexa Fluor 594 - labeled actin is damaged by prolonged exposure to green light , we locally damage the actin gel by illuminating a small region with a 543 - nm laser ( see Materials and Methods ) and , thus , induce symmetry breaking ( Fig . 1 d and Movie 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . For spontaneous symmetry breaking , we define the moment of symmetry breaking as the first appearance of the notch in the actin gel . We denote the symmetry breaking time (cid:3) as the interval between the addition of the beads to the motility medium and the moment of symmetry breaking , and we define h * as the actin gel thickness at time (cid:3) . The values of (cid:3) and h * depend on the size of the beads , the medium composition , and the presence of crosslinkers , as described below . Depending on the exact composition of the motility medium , two different symmetry - breaking scenarios can be observed , as shown in Fig . 2 a and b . In case I ( Fig . 2 a ) , the actin gel grows continuously until the symmetry breaks spontaneously . No steady - state thick - ness is reached in this case . In contrast , in case II ( Fig . 2 b ) , symmetry breaking is preceded by a plateau in gel thickness . The average time of symmetry breaking , (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) , is usually longer in case II and could reach infinity , whereas the distribution of (cid:3) ( double - headed arrows in Fig . 2 a and b ) is wider ( (cid:6) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) can be up to 70 % for case II , whereas it is typically 20 – 40 % for case I ) . The occurrence of case I or II does not depend on the size of the beads . For both cases , h * increases linearly with increasing bead radius ( Fig . 2 c ) . The average time (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) also increases with the bead radius ( Fig . 2 d ) , and its increase is approximately linear in R , in agreement with earlier observations ( 4 ) . Effect of the Composition of the Medium . The only protein , besides actin and VCA , that is required for the accumulation of actin at the bead surface is Arp2 (cid:2) 3 . Gelsolin is not required for the growth of the actin gel , but without gelsolin , no symmetry breaking is observed , even after 8 h ( see Fig . 7 b , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , and the actin gel at steady state is approximately four times thinner than at the optimal gelsolin concentration ( Fig . 3 b ) . Symmetry breaking is observed for Arp2 (cid:2) 3 concentrations (cid:7) 0 . 002 (cid:2) M and gelsolin concentrations of (cid:7) 0 . 03 (cid:2) M . The initial growth rate of the gel has an optimum at (cid:8) 0 . 05 (cid:2) M Arp2 (cid:2) 3 and 0 . 7 (cid:2) M gelsolin ( Fig . 3 a ) , where the gel thickness is highest ( Fig . 3 b ) and the time of symmetry breaking is , within experimental error , at a mini - mum ( (cid:8) 8 min for 3 - (cid:2) m radius beads ; see Fig . 3 c ) . Varying Arp2 (cid:2) 3 and gelsolin concentrations leads to a transition from case I to II ( as indicated in Fig . 3 , see also Fig . 7 a and b ) . Contrary to earlier observations on Listeria ( 15 ) , we found that ADF (cid:2) cofilin is not essential for symmetry breaking and motility , although it enhances gel growth and symmetry breaking ( Fig . 3 a and c ) at concentrations of (cid:9) 10 (cid:2) M . However , increasing the ADF (cid:2) cofilin concentration from 10 to 25 (cid:2) M shifts the behavior from case I to II ( see also Fig . 7 c ) , decreases the steady - state gel thickness ( Fig . 3 b ) , and increases the time of symmetry breaking ( Fig . 3 c ) . At (cid:7) 25 (cid:2) M , no symmetry breaking Fig . 1 . Spontaneous and induced symmetry breaking around beads . VCA - coated beads were placed in a medium containing 7 . 44 (cid:2) M F - actin ( 10 % labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 ) , 0 . 05 (cid:2) M Arp2 (cid:2) 3 , 0 . 2 (cid:2) M gelsolin , and 3 (cid:2) M ADF (cid:2) coﬁlin .

Profilin is not essential and has a smaller effect than the other proteins . It speeds up polymerization and slightly enhances symmetry breaking ( Figs . 3 a and c and 7 d ) . After the symmetry is broken , the beads develop an actin comet and start moving with a speed that depends on the concentrations of the actin - binding proteins in a comparable fashion as for Listeria ( 15 ) . We found that the optimal conditions for motility ( highest velocity ) are approximately the same as those for symmetry breaking ( shortest time (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) ) . The optimal mix is (cid:8) 0 . 05 (cid:2) M Arp2 (cid:2) 3 , 0 . 7 (cid:2) M gelsolin , 5 (cid:2) M ADF (cid:2) cofilin , and 0 . 8 (cid:2) M profilin , which gives an average velocity (cid:8) 0 . 5 (cid:2) m (cid:2) min for 3 - (cid:2) m radius beads , similar to values reported before for beads ( 4 ) and Listeria ( 15 ) . Effect of Crosslinkers . To investigate the influence of the elastic properties of the actin gel , the following crosslinkers were tested : the native actin crosslinkers (cid:1) - actinin , fascin , and filamin , and the nonphysiological crosslinker streptavidin used in combination with biotinylated actin ( 24 % of total actin ) . At sufficiently high crosslinker concentrations ( (cid:7) 1 (cid:2) M ) , we could see actin bundles throughout the sample for all four crosslinkers . As expected ( 11 ) , the bundles were the most obvious for fascin and the least obvious for filamin . The thickness of the actin gel at which symmetry breaking occurs , h * , is hardly affected by fascin and (cid:1) - actinin ( Fig . 3 e ) and the system is in case I for all concentrations ( see also Fig . 8 a and b , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . However , with increasing concentrations of fascin or (cid:1) - actinin , the initial growth velocity of the actin gel decreases ( Fig . 3 d ) and the time of symmetry breaking increases ( Fig . 3 f ) . The presence of filamin slightly decreases h * ( Fig . 3 e ) and causes a transition from case I to II ( see also Fig . 8 c ) . Interestingly , this effect is much more pronounced for biotin (cid:2) streptavidin crosslinking , which also causes a transition to case II ( see also Fig . 8 d ) and gives a minimum gel thickness and a maximum time (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) at a streptavidin (cid:2) biotin – actin ratio of (cid:8) 1 : 2 ( Fig . 3 e and f ) . Discussion Symmetry Breaking Is Due to Stress Release . As shown in Fig . 1 a , symmetry breaking starts as a notch at the external surface of the actin gel ( arrowhead at 24 min ) . The hole has an elongated shape , like a crack ( Fig . 1 b ) , and grows inward and expands laterally , rupturing near the bead surface . As indicated by the arrows in Fig . 1 at 44 min , the gel straightens near the edges of the hole to reduce its curvature . Together , these observations strongly suggest that symmetry breaking is driven by the release of elastic energy ( 4 , 19 ) stored in the actin cloud , which is gel - like because of the action of Arp2 (cid:2) 3 and crosslinkers ( 22 – 24 ) .

PNAS (cid:1) May 31 , 2005 (cid:1) vol . 102 (cid:1) no . 22 (cid:1) 7849 B I O P H Y S I C S piece of gel that is polymerized and crosslinked at the bead surface is stretched as it moves outward ( see Fig . 6 ) , resulting in the build - up of a tensile stress , which is maximum at the exterior surface ( 19 ) . The elastic energy stored in the gel may be released by a fracture of the gel ( 4 , 19 ) , and this breakage of crosslinks or filaments leads to polarization of the actin gel . Alternatively , symmetry breaking may result from an enhancement of depo - lymerization at the exterior of the gel by the tensile stress , which renders the symmetric gel unstable toward inhomogeneous fluctuations in the gel thickness ( 18 ) . In both cases , symmetry breaking starts at the exterior of the gel where the tensile stress is largest . Although it is not excluded that the first event generating the notch could be based on unstable small - scale fluctuations ( 18 ) , the process that follows is more reminiscent of the fracture of a brittle elastic material or a gel , than of a depolymerization phenomenon . Furthermore , our observations do not favor a stochastic mechanism based on fluctuations in polymerization and depolymerization rates , which predicts that symmetry breaking should start at the bead surface ( 17 ) . Next , we focus on the initial stages of the fracture event and analyze the data in terms of an elastic model for gel growth and fracture . The variables and parameters used in the model are summarized in Table 1 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . Growth of an Actin Gel Around a Bead . First , we consider the growth of a homogeneous crosslinked actin gel around a bead . Poly - merization occurs at the surface of the bead ( Fig . 6 ) , whereas depolymerization occurs at the pointed ends that are assumed to be mostly situated near the exterior of the gel ( 18 , 19 ) . Thus , the growth velocity of the gel can be described as follows : dh dt (cid:4) a (cid:10) k on b C a (cid:5) k off p (cid:11) , [ 1 ] where k on b and k off p are the rate constants for monomer addition at the inner surface ( barbed ends ) and monomer loss at the outer surface ( pointed ends ) , respectively , C a is the concentration of G - actin available for polymerization , and a (cid:3) 2 . 7 nm is the gained filament length per monomer ( 25 ) . The rate parameters k on b and k off p depend on the stress in the gel , because forces pushing or pulling on a filament can change the rate constants ( 26 ) . However , in the early stages of gel growth , the stresses in the gel are still small , and the rate constants are approximately equal to those of free barbed and pointed ends . We find experimentally that the optimum initial polymerization rate v p 0 is (cid:8) 0 . 6 (cid:2) m (cid:2) min , in accordance with an estimate of Eq . 1 using reported values for the rate constants ( 27 ) : k on b (cid:3) 12 (cid:2) M (cid:12) 1 (cid:1) s (cid:12) 1 , k off p (cid:3) 0 . 8 s (cid:12) 1 , and C a (cid:3) 0 . 6 (cid:2) M ( close to the critical concen - tration of pointed ends , because all barbed ends are capped by gelsolin ) . Note that k on b , k off p , and thus v p 0 , depend on the concentrations of the various actin binding proteins ( see Fig . 3 a and d ) . After several minutes , the growth velocity of the gel decreases , because the stress in the gel increases with increasing thickness . If the symmetry does not break , the gel thickness reaches a steady state , where polymerization at the bead surface balances depolymerization at the external surface ( 19 ) . The steady - state thickness is either stress - limited , in which case it is proportional to the bead radius R , or diffusion - limited and independent of R ( 19 , 28 ) . For case II , in which a steady state is indeed reached , we are in the stress - limited regime , because h s is proportional to R ( Fig . 2 c ) . The following equation then applies ( 19 ) : h s (cid:3) R (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ E (cid:6) 2 a (cid:5) 1 / 2 , [ 2 ] where (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ (cid:3) kT ln ( k on b C a (cid:2) k off p ) is a measure for the chemical energy of the polymerization process , (cid:6) is the mesh size of the actin network , and E is the elastic modulus of the gel , which depends on (cid:6) and on the density of crosslinks ( 9 ) . Symmetry Breaking and Fracture . As suggested by Griffith ( 29 ) , the resistance of a material to fracture can be estimated by consid - ering the contributions of the fracture energy that is needed for breaking bonds ( U br ) and the elastic energy that is released when a crack is formed ( U el ) . Fig . 1 b and Movies 1 – 3 show that the crack has an elongated shape . An elongated crack is more likely to grow than a circular one , because the stresses are higher at the tip of a narrow , elongated hole than around a circular hole ( 30 ) . Therefore , let us consider an elongated crack at the exterior of the spherical gel with a depth l and a length l 1 along the contour of the gel ( Fig . 4 a ) . We assume that initially l and l 1 are of the same order of magnitude ( 31 ) and that the crack is much smaller than the gel thickness h . The tensile stress can then be considered as constant along the crack : (cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:7) (cid:8)(cid:8) ( h ) (cid:3) Eh (cid:2) R ( 19 ) . The amount of elastic energy released by the presence of the crack is on the order of U el (cid:3) ( (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) E ) l 3 (cid:3) El 3 h 2 (cid:2) R 2 ( 29 , 31 ) . ( Note that we neglect all geometrical prefactors that depend on the exact shape of the crack . ) The energy required for breaking bonds is U br (cid:3) (cid:13) l 2 , where (cid:13) is the fracture energy per unit area ( 29 ) . It can be estimated as (cid:13) (cid:3) (cid:9) c (cid:2) l c 2 , where (cid:9) c is the energy needed to break one crosslink and 1 (cid:2) l c 2 is the average number of crosslinks per unit area ( with l c being the average distance between crosslinks ) . The total energy change due to the crack U ( l ) (cid:3) U br (cid:12) U el is maximal for a value l * (cid:3) E (cid:13) (cid:2) (cid:7) 2 ( Fig . 4 b ) . For small cracks with l (cid:9) l * , crack growth is energetically unfavorable , but for l (cid:10) l * , crack growth is spontaneous because the energy decreases with increasing l . As the gel thickness and the tensile stress increase , the critical crack length l * decreases ( Fig . 4 b ) . Assuming that fracture starts as soon as the critical crack size l * equals the typical size d of a flaw or a preexisting crack present in the material ( 29 ) , spontaneous fracture occurs at a critical stress (cid:7) f (cid:3) ( E (cid:13) (cid:2) d ) 1 / 2 or at the following critical thickness : h f (cid:3) R (cid:4) (cid:13) Ed (cid:5) 1 / 2 . [ 3 ] When the stress is smaller than the critical stress (cid:7) f , fracture can still be triggered by an external perturbation , as shown by damaging a small region in the actin gel ( Fig . 1 d and Movie 4 ) .

Two Scenarios for Spontaneous Fracture : Cases I and II . The presence of a plateau in the h ( t ) curves depends on the relative magnitude of the homogeneous steady - state thickness ( Eq . 2 ) and the critical fracture thickness ( Eq . 3 ) . We define a dimensionless parameter (cid:11) as follows : (cid:11)(cid:4) h s h f (cid:3) (cid:4) d (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ a (cid:6) 2 (cid:13) (cid:5) 1 / 2 (cid:3) (cid:4) dl c 2 (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ a (cid:6) 2 (cid:9) c (cid:5) 1 / 2 . [ 4 ] Case I corresponds to (cid:11) (cid:7) 1 , because the critical stress for fracture is reached before the thickness reaches its homogeneous steady - state value . Thus , the gel grows until h (cid:3) h f , where l * (cid:3) d and the gel ruptures spontaneously ( Fig . 4 b ) . Case II corre - sponds to (cid:11) (cid:9) 1 , because the gel thickness reaches a steady - state value h s before the critical stress is reached , so that l * (cid:7) d ( Fig . 4 b ) . Note that both h s and h f are proportional to R ( Eqs . 2 and 3 ) , in agreement with our experimental results ( Fig . 2 c ) . Let us estimate orders of magnitude for h s and h f and compare with the experimental results . For case I , h f (cid:2) R ( the slope in Fig . 2 c ) is (cid:8) 0 . 4 . With Eq . 3 , and an energy per crosslink (cid:9) c of order 10 kT ( similar to the strength of a bond between actin monomers ; ref . 32 ) , a distance between crosslinks l c of (cid:8) 50 nm ( 28 ) and an elastic modulus E of 10 3 – 10 4 Pa ( 22 , 23 ) , we find a typical flaw size d of order a tenth of a micrometer , which is reasonable . Note that (cid:9) c is not expected to depend strongly on the type of crosslink because rupture can occur also on an actin filament next to the crosslink . A lower estimate for the average time of symmetry breaking is (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:3) h f (cid:2) v p 0 , which neglects the decrease of the growth velocity as the gel thickness increases . Taking v p 0 as independent of R , we find that (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) is proportional to R , in agreement with Fig . 2 d ( case I ) . By using v p 0 (cid:3) 0 . 3 (cid:2) m (cid:2) min , as obtained from Fig . 2 a , and h f (cid:2) R (cid:3) 0 . 4 , as obtained from Fig . 2 c , we find (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:2) R (cid:3) 1 . 3 min (cid:2) (cid:2) m , just below the slope in Fig . 2 d . For case II , the slope h s (cid:2) R in Fig . 2 c is (cid:8) 0 . 3 , of the same order as an estimate of Eq . 3 using ( see above ) k on b (cid:3) 12 (cid:2) M (cid:12) 1 (cid:1) s (cid:12) 1 , k off p (cid:3) 0 . 8 s (cid:12) 1 , C a (cid:3) 0 . 6 (cid:2) M , E (cid:3) 10 3 (cid:12) 10 4 Pa , and (cid:6) (cid:3) 50 nm . Note that the two characteristic thicknesses h s and h f are of the same order of magnitude , so that a transition between the two regimes can be observed by a slight variation of the parameters . The parameter (cid:11) is independent of R , so that the transition from case I to II does not depend on R , in agreement with our experimental results ( Fig . 2 ) . Note also that (cid:11) is independent of the elastic modulus E but does depend on the mesh size (cid:6) and the fracture energy (cid:13) . In case II , there is a delay between reaching the steady state and the start of fracture , which can range from several minutes to infinity . This delay could be explained by the following two different effects : an energy barrier for fracture nucleation that is overcome by thermal fluctuations ( 31 ) or the time needed for a thickness fluctuation to grow until it generates sufficient tensile stress to produce a crack ( 18 ) . The first mechanism introduces a nucleation rate k n (cid:14) exp ( (cid:12) U a (cid:2) kT ) , where U a is an energy barrier to go from the preexisting crack of length d to a crack of length l * : U a (cid:3) U ( l * ) (cid:12) U ( d ) ( Fig . 4 b ) . For d (cid:9)(cid:9) l * ( corresponding to h s (cid:9)(cid:9) h f ) , we get U a (cid:3) U ( l * ) (cid:3) E 2 (cid:13) 3 (cid:2) (cid:7) 4 , which becomes the following at h (cid:3) h s ( with (cid:7) (cid:3) Eh s (cid:2) R and Eq . 2 ) : U a (cid:3) (cid:13) 3 (cid:6) 4 a 2 (cid:10)(cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ (cid:11) 2 (cid:3) (cid:9) c 3 (cid:6) 4 a 2 (cid:10)(cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ (cid:11) 2 l c 6 . [ 5 ] The average time of symmetry breaking in this regime can be estimated as the time needed to reach steady state plus the average delay before a crack is nucleated : (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:3) h s (cid:2) v p 0 (cid:15) 1 (cid:2) k n . This nucleation mechanism explains our observation that the distribution of (cid:3) is wider in case II than in case I ( Fig . 2 d ) . The second effect involves a characteristic time that is much larger than the time needed to reach a steady state ( 18 ) and could come into play in our case II observations in which the time of symmetry breaking largely exceeds the time necessary to reach the steady state . In this situation , symmetry breaking might start as a fluctuation in the gel thickness , which is amplified because of enhanced depolymerization and results in a fracture as soon as the amplitude of the perturbation becomes of order l * . Thus , this mechanism would greatly enhance symmetry breaking in conditions in which the thermal nucleation rate k n is small . Note that we did not take into account stress dissipation by rearrangement of crosslinks , which could become relevant es - pecially if the gel growth is slow and would increase the symmetry breaking time . The Effect of Actin - Binding Proteins . As shown in Fig . 3 , the various actin - binding proteins have a large effect on the growth of actin gels and the kinetics of symmetry breaking . Next , we discuss these effects in the light of the known functions of these proteins and compare these results to the predictions of the model described above . Arp2 (cid:2) 3 , activated by VCA , is essential for gel growth around the beads and enhances polymerization ( 7 ) ( as shown in Fig . 3 a ) and , thus , increases (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ . Because Arp2 (cid:2) 3 induces branching of actin filaments , it reduces the mesh size (cid:6) and the distance between crosslinks l c , and decreases the typical flaw size d ( 24 ) . If we assume that Arp2 (cid:2) 3 affects the mesh size and the crosslink density in the same way ( l c (cid:14) (cid:6) ) and that (cid:9) c is not affected by Arp2 (cid:2) 3 , we find from Eq . 4 that (cid:11) (cid:14) ( d (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ ) 1 / 2 . We observe a transition from case II to I when the Arp2 (cid:2) 3 concen - tration increases from 0 . 0025 to 0 . 02 (cid:2) M ( Figs . 3 and 7 a ) , which indicates that (cid:11) increases and that the increase in (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ is stronger than the decrease in d . At (cid:7) 0 . 05 (cid:2) M , we see a decrease of the polymerization rate , probably because the large number of nucleated barbed ends depletes the pool of G - actin . As a result , (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ and , thus , (cid:11) decrease and the behavior corresponds again to case II ( Fig . 3 ) . As expected , the time of symmetry breaking is smallest in the concentration range that corresponds to case I . Gelsolin caps barbed ends and prevents them from elongating ( 8 , 33 ) . As a result , the concentration C a of G - actin in the medium increases with increasing gelsolin concentration and polymerization is enhanced according to Eq . 1 , in agreement with our observations ( Fig . 3 a ) . Furthermore , the capping activity of gelsolin also decreases the number of growing barbed ends , so that the density of the gel decreases ( 34 ) , leading to an increase in (cid:6) , l c , and in the typical flaw size d ( inhomogeneities become more important with decreasing density ) . Assuming again that l c (cid:14) (cid:6) , because (cid:11) (cid:14) ( d (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ ) 1 / 2 , we find that an increase in the gelsolin concentration leads to an increase in the param - eter (cid:11) ( Eq . 4 ) and a transition from case II to I , as observed experimentally ( Figs . 3 and 7 b ) . Note that without gelsolin , no symmetry breaking could be observed , indicating that the energy barrier for crack nucleation ( Eq . 5 ) is too large . As expected , the time of symmetry breaking is again smallest for concentrations corresponding to case I . Note that at the present concentration of calcium symmetry breaking could also be enhanced by the severing activity of gelsolin ( 33 ) . ADF (cid:2) cofilin is known to increase the depolymerization rate at the pointed ends k off p , which results in a further increase in the concentration C a of G - actin ( 8 , 35 ) and , therefore , in an increase in the polymerization velocity , as observed ( Fig . 3 a ) . At low concentrations , in which the behavior corresponds to case I , symmetry breaking is enhanced by this increased polymerization velocity ( Fig . 3 c ) , whereas the fracture thickness h f ( Eq . 3 ) is hardly affected by ADF . The transition to case II at 10 (cid:2) M ADF (cid:2) cofilin can be explained by the enhanced depolymeriza - tion rate , which causes a decrease of (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ and , thus , (cid:11) . The steady - state thickness h s decreases with increasing ADF con - centration ( Fig . 3 b ) in accordance with Eq . 2 , whereas the time of symmetry breaking increases and becomes virtually infinite at very high concentrations ( Fig . 3 c ) . Last , profilin is known to enhance polymerization ( see Fig . 3 a ) , because it provides G - actin for polymerization and van der Gucht et al . PNAS (cid:1) May 31 , 2005 (cid:1) vol . 102 (cid:1) no . 22 (cid:1) 7851 B I O P H Y S I C S catalyzes nucleotide exchange ( ADP to ATP ) on actin mono - mers ( 8 ) . As a result , symmetry breaking is slightly enhanced ( Fig . 3 c ) . Because (cid:11) (cid:7) 1 in the absence of profilin and (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ increases in the presence of profilin , (cid:11) increases and the system remains in case I . Effect of Crosslinkers . The four different crosslinkers have differ - ent effects on the characteristics of symmetry breaking . (cid:1) - Actinin and fascin are dynamic crosslinkers that favor the formation of actin bundles ( 10 , 13 ) . This bundling may be the reason for the decreased polymerization velocity upon addition of crosslinkers ( Fig . 3 d ) , because bundling could stabilize actin filaments , leaving less actin available for polymerization ( 36 ) . The final thickness of the actin gel ( Fig . 3 e ) and the scenario of symmetry breaking are hardly affected by these crosslinkers and the increase in the time (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) ( Fig . 3 f ) can be attributed completely to the decreased gel growth rate . For all fascin and (cid:1) - actinin concentrations , we are in case I , so that the time of symmetry breaking is equal to the time needed for the gel to reach its critical thickness : (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:3) h f (cid:2) v p 0 . For (cid:1) - actinin , v p 0 decreases by approximately a factor of two , whereas (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) increases by the same factor . For fascin , a 2 . 5 - fold decrease in v p 0 is mirrored by a 2 . 5 - fold increase in (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) . These results suggest that (cid:1) - actinin and fascin affect the structure and the elastic properties of the gel only weakly , perhaps because the Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - nucleated array is not appropriate for binding of these proteins . Filamin crosslinks actin filaments into 3D networks that are stiffer and more solid - like than those formed by fascin and (cid:1) - actinin ( 11 , 12 ) . With increasing amounts of filamin , a tran - sition from case I to II can be observed ( see also Fig . 8 c ) , which indicates that the parameter (cid:11) ( Eq . 4 ) decreases when crosslinks are added . This decrease in (cid:11) can be explained by an increase in the fracture energy (cid:13) ( or a decrease in the average distance between crosslinks l c ) and a decrease in the flaw size d . The mesh size (cid:6) can be assumed to be unaffected by crosslinkers because it is determined by the density of the actin gel ( 9 ) . The time (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) increases significantly with increasing filamin concentration ( Fig . 3 f ) because of an increase in the fracture delay time ( Eq . 5 ; see also Fig . 8 c ) . Contrary to fascin and (cid:1) - actinin , it cannot be explained by the polymerization rate , which is almost unaffected by filamin ( Fig . 3 d ) , in agreement with the observation that fewer bundles could be observed in the medium for filamin than for the other crosslinkers . The steady - state thickness is affected only slightly by filamin . Interestingly , the effect on h * and (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) is much more pro - nounced for biotin (cid:2) streptavidin , which is a much stronger crosslinker than fascin , (cid:1) - actinin , and filamin ( 10 ) . We see a clear transition from case I to II after addition of streptavidin ( see also Fig . 8 d ) , and h * decreases to a minimum and (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) increases to a maximum at a ratio of 1 : 2 between streptavidin and biotin ( Fig . 3 e and f ) . This ratio corresponds to the optimum ratio for crosslinking , because every crosslink is composed of two biotin – actin monomers and one streptavidin . At higher strepta - vidin concentrations , crosslinking is less efficient so that h * increases again and (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:5) decreases . An explanation for why streptavidin has a larger effect on h * than filamin is that the polymerization velocity decreases more strongly for streptavidin than for filamin ( Fig . 3 d ) , which leads to a larger decrease in (cid:6) (cid:2) ˜ and , thus , h s ( Eq . 2 ) . Moreover , the dynamics of biotin (cid:2) streptavidin crosslinks are much slower than for filamin . The lifetime of a filamin crosslink is in the order of seconds ( 37 ) , so that a crosslink formed by filamin at the bead surface just after polymerization is dissociated long before it reaches the outer regions of the gel . Hence , a filamin crosslink only slightly contributes to the stress , so that the steady - state gel thickness h s ( Eq . 2 ) is only weakly affected . Biotin (cid:2) streptavidin crosslinks , on the contrary , are virtually irreversible ( 10 ) , so that they do increase the stress and decrease the steady - state thickness . Concluding Remarks . By using VCA - coated beads in a mix of purified proteins , we have shown that fracture of an elastic actin gel can drive symmetry breaking . Moreover , our results suggest an explanation for why symmetry breaking on beads in cell extracts is more difficult to obtain than in the purified protein mix ( under optimal conditions ) ( 3 , 4 ) ; the abundance of crosslinkers in cell extracts slows down fracture nucleation . More generally , the mechanism we describe here might be relevant in cells for polarization in the absence of external cues .
