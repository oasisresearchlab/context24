Structures based on actin filaments range from parallel bundles to gel net - works . The bundles provide tensile strength , serve as cables for strong contractile activity and as tracks for organelle transport . Three - dimensional orthogonal networks provide elasticity , accommodate internal dif - fusion of water , solutes and small organelles , resist weak OSMOTIC and HYDROSTATIC FLUID FLOWS and serve as scaffolds for weak contractions . They are barriers to spontaneous movement of large organelles and they localize signal transduction and other intracellular reactions . Actin - binding proteins orchestrate the engineering of the actin cytoskeleton in response to signalling cas - cades . These proteins have diverse functions — regu - lating the addition and loss of actin subunits to and from linear actin polymers , organizing actin polymers into and out of three - dimensional scaffolding and attaching actin filaments to cellular membranes . This review describes the history , structure and functions of one group of these proteins — the filamins . Discovery of the filamin protein family The purification of the first filamin was an accidental by - product of an attempt to isolate a Ca 2 + - sensitive myosin from rabbit MACROPHAGES 1 . Small quantities of this protein , then called ‘actin - binding protein’ , caused large amounts of purified muscle actin to precipitate 2 . Antibodies recognizing this protein decorated actin - rich stress fibres in chicken FIBROBLASTS . This appearance led to the naming of the antigen as ‘filamin’ 3 , 4 . Such anti - filamin antibodies identified filamin - like proteins in diverse vertebrate cells , including muscle cells 5 , 6 . Independently , a search for actin crosslinking fac - tors in cytoplasmic extracts of Dictyostelium dis - coideum led to the purification of a PARALOGUE of the fil - amins 7 , 8 , later also found in Entamoeba histolytica , the pathogen responsible for human amoebic dysentery 9 . The complementary DNA of this protein was the first filamin family member to be cloned 10 . Two filamin iso - forms in Drosophila melanogaster are separate products of the cheerio gene , which was identified by studies of sterile fly mutants unable to construct normal OVARIAN RING CANALS 11 , 12 ; a second as yet unnamed gene is under investigation ( D . Brown , personal communication ) . The fact that the discovery of different members of the filamin family arose through different approaches has led to a lack of consistency in the nomenclature . To address this problem , we propose here a uniform nam - ing system ( BOX 1 ; TABLE 1 ) . Structure of the filamins As filamins are extended ‘filamentous’ dimers when viewed by electron microscopy ( FIG . 1 ) , ‘filamin’ ( abbre - viated FLN ) is a reasonable name for this class of mole - cule , although filamins do not necessarily produce the FILAMINS AS INTEGRATORS OF CELL MECHANICS AND SIGNALLING Thomas P .

Vertebrate and some Drosophila filamins are dimers with large ( 240 – 280 kDa ) polypeptide chains that associate at their carboxyl termini 11 – 14 . The amino - terminal actin - binding domain of filamin sub - units encompasses a stretch of 275 amino acids with sequence motifs first recognized in β - spectrin , dys - trophin and α - actininand found in other actin - fila - ment - binding proteins , such as calponin and utrophin 15 . The rest of the polypeptide consists of 24 repeated sequences of ~ 96 amino acids , interrupted by one or two short ‘hinge’ segments . Secondary structure algorithm modelling of the repeats reveals that these segments form antiparallel β - sheet domains that overlap so as to generate a rod 16 . The minimal requirement for membership of the filamin family is a string of the characteristic repeated β - sheet units . The human filamin amino - acid sequences show about 60 – 80 % overall sequence homology , with the greatest variation towards the car - boxy - terminal self - association domains . But some members of the family are much more divergent : amoeba filamins and one Drosophila filamin have much shorter dimerization domains than vertebrate fil - amins ( FIG . 2 ) and a Drosophila filamin isoform even lacks the amino - terminal actin - binding motif . Box 1 | Proposed nomenclature for the filamin family The prefixes hs ( Homo sapiens ) , gg ( Gallus gallus ) , dm ( Drosophila melanogaster ) , dd ( Dictyostelium discoideum ) denote the systematic name of the filamin - expressing species . The alphabetical listing of human filamins in TABLE 1 reflects the order in which complete sequence data entered the human genome database and the convention of using letters rather than numbers to describe them . An additional designation , h + or h – , describes whether the proteins contain hinge 1 . For example , a human FLNb that contains hinge 1 would be called hsFLNbh + . The Drosophila filamins are not orthologues of the human proteins , leading to the use of numbers rather than letters to specify the two recognized Drosophila filamin genes . A suffix designating the number of filamin repeats discriminates the two products of the Drosophila FLN1 gene . Figure 1 | The structure of human FLNa . a | The amino - terminal actin - binding domain contains sequence motifs found in many actin - filament - binding proteins 15 . The rest of the protein is made of 24 repeats of ~ 96 amino acids each . These probably fold into antiparallel β - pleated sheet domains that overlap so as to generate a rod . Dimerization occurs through the twenty - fourth repeat . All vertebrate filamins have a stretch of 35 amino acids between repeats 23 and 24 designated ‘hinge 2’ . Some filamins also have a second hinge designated ‘hinge 1’ between repeats 15 and 16 . The subunits have straight segments corresponding to the β - sheet rods interrupted by bends corresponding to sites susceptible to proteolysis by calpain 68 . b | Electron micrographs of tantalum – tungsten - cast rabbit macrophage FLNa dimers 31 , 69 .

The answer lies in the geometry of actin - filament branching imposed by different actin - filament - crosslinking molecules . At low molar ratios compared with actin , filamins produce an optically clear gel 23 , 24 . Electron micrographs of actin filaments crosslinked by FLNa 25 , 26 or Dictyostelium filamins 27 in vitro show strik - ing high - angle branching ( FIG . 3a – c ) , and the inter - branch distances are inversely proportional to the fil - amin concentration . At branching points , the POINTED ENDS of actin filaments intersect with the sides of other filaments to form T - or Y - shaped structures ( FIG . 3b ) . The mechanism by which filamin promotes actin - filament branching is incompletely understood . What is clear is that filamin must dimerize 28 and must have intact amino - terminal actin - binding domains 29 , 30 . The extended end - to - end length of the FLNa dimer in which sequential rigid rod domains are interspersed with flexible hinges has been proposed to make filamin behave like a ‘molecular leaf spring’ , lending FLNa the mix of flexibility and stiffness required to tether large actin filaments and hold them in an improbable per - pendicular arrangement 16 , 31 . The LEADING EDGE of motile cells contains three - dimensional orthogonal networks of short filaments overlapping in X - , T - or Y - shaped junctions 32 . FLNa has been detected at such junctions in rabbit macrophage , human PLATELET and tumour cell cytoskeletons 33 – 36 . The inter - branch distances are shorter in platelet than in macrophage actin cytoskeletons , consistent with the higher FLNa content of platelets . One study that used different antibodies to those used in previous labelling experiments failed to localize filamin at filament junc - tions in the leading edge of a fibroblast cell line 37 . However , in many other studies , filamin molecules were found to localize uniformly throughout the actin Constructing orthogonal actin networks in vitro Around the time of the discovery of the first filamins , cell biologists began to examine a phenomenon in which initially soluble extracts of diverse cell types solidified , or ‘gelled’ , as actin polymerized , and the GELS seemed to be more solid than equivalent concentra - tions of pure actin 17 . As macrophage FLNa so efficient - ly precipitates filamentous actin , it was a prime candi - date to explain this actin gelation in unstirred extracts . Gelation is due to the crosslinking of actin filaments into orthogonal networks , and subsequent studies showed that FLNa is the most potent actin - filament - crosslinking protein 18 , 19 . Indeed , only one FLNa dimer per actin filament is sufficient to induce gelation 20 . Figure 2 | Schematic subunit structures of some filamins . The Dictyostelium filamin is shown in dimer form 70 , 71 . The crystal structure of rod repeats 5 and 6 of Dictyostelium filamin reveals that the two monomers overlap only within the sixth repeats , thus forming an antiparallel dimer . The sixth repeats from both subunits fold around each other to effect a very tight association . Rods 1 – 5 do not pair and allow high flexibility between the actin - binding domains 72 . 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 24 20 9 Vertebrate filamins dmFLN1 - 20 ( Drosophila ) dmFLN1 - 9 ( Drosophila ) ddFLN ( Dictyostelium ) Figure 3 | Electron micrographs showing crosslinked complexes of actin filaments . a | Short filaments of rabbit skeletal muscle actin polymerized in the presence of rabbit macrophage FLNa and rotary shadowed with platinum 25 . b | Pieces of cortical actin filaments released from human platelet cytoskeletons by centrifugation 73 .

Third , the Arp2 / 3 complex increases the elasticity of actin filament solutions in vitro , but much higher Arp2 / 3 to actin molar ratios 42 are neces - sary to produce elastic values similar to those generated by FLNa , at least under conditions examined so far 43 . Fourth , the linkages between actin filaments formed by the Arp2 / 3 complex are metastable and dissociate 40 , whereas interactions between FLNa and actin filaments are robust on a long timescale 43 , 44 . And last , although some actin filament – filament junctions in cells have the 70 o angle associated with Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching , others do not , indicating that , after the Arp2 / 3 complex initiates actin - filament branching , fil - amins might stabilize the branches and weld spots where growing filaments overlap . The greater flexibility of filamin - mediated branching could be important in this three - dimensional interlocking process . Integrators of cell mechanics and signalling Filamins bind various other macromolecules in addi - tion to filamentous actin . So far , 20 binding partners have been found , and more are expected . Most of the interactions occur through the carboxy - terminal end of filamins . Although the physiological significance of some of the interactions listed in TABLE 2 is unknown , one obvious theme is that the interwebbing of actin scaffolds with membrane receptors is a way to provide mechanical stability to the cell membrane and to main - tain cell – cell and cell – matrix connections . By bringing together receptors such as β - integrins , the submem - brane actin network and intracellular signalling com - ponents , filamins can facilitate the activation of local cellular processes , in particular those involving actin polymerization ( FIG . 5 ) . A good example of the potential of such macromol - ecular cooperation is the fact that FLNa binds to RHO FAMILY GTPASES and to some of their regulatory cofactors that are strongly implicated in the regulation of actin assembly and myosin activation 45 . Ral binds FLNa in a GTP - dependent manner , whereas Cdc42 , RhoA and Rac1 bind FLNa constitutively 46 , 47 . Trio , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases , binds FLNa , implying that switching on and off Rho GTPases constitutively bound to filamins might regulate the spa - tial positioning of actin assembly 48 . So by interacting directly with the Rho signalling apparatus , filamins can organize actin filaments that elongate under the influ - ence of these GTPases into three - dimensional configu - rations useful to the cell . A growing body of evidence points towards the involvement of filamins in signal transduction . For example , DICTYOSTELIUM SLUGS that lack filamin have markedly impaired photo - and thermosensory responses , indicating that filamin has an adaptor role in these processes 49 . In mammalian fibroblasts , FLNa transduces stress signals to the actin cytoskeleton . In cells subjected to shear stress , β 1 integrin directly asso - ciates with filamin , signalling the stressed cell to stiffen to render it resistant to subsequent strains . Cells lacking FLNa do not show a stiffening response 50 . This so - called cytoskeletal network , right up to the plasma mem - brane 33 – 36 ( FIG . 4 ) . Do filamin and the Arp2 / 3 complex cooperate ? Filamins can orientate actin filaments perpendicularly as they polymerize spontaneously in vitro , but what happens in cells that tightly regulate actin polymeriza - tion ? One candidate for working with filamins in estab - lishing cortical actin architecture is the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , an assembly of seven polypeptides . The Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates branching actin filament growth in the barbed - end direction off a pre - existing actin fila - ment at nearly fixed angles of 70 o in vitro 39 – 41 . The belief has spread that Arp2 / 3 is the most important actin - filament - crosslinking factor in cortical cytoplasm 37 . However , there are several arguments that the Arp2 / 3 complex synergizes with other actin - fila - ment - crosslinking proteins such as filamin . First , and most importantly , the Arp2 / 3 complex is abundant in filamin - deficient MELANOMA cells ( described below ) , but evidently is unable to stabilize their membranes or sup - port locomotion . Second , polymer branching per se is not sufficient for polymer gelation . Electron micro - graphs of branched filaments made with Arp2 / 3 show brush - like structures but not the closing of loops 39 , 41 that is necessary to form three - dimensional gels , and Figure 4 | Electron micrograph of the actin cytoskeleton at the periphery of a human blood platelet . The cell was activated for 5 min , extracted with Triton X - 100 , fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde and then reacted sequentially with affinity - purified rabbit anti - FLNa peptide antibodies and with anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G complexed to 10 nm gold beads . The specimens were then rapidly frozen , critical - point dried , and cast with tantalum – tungsten 35 . The replica reveals extensive labelling of the cytoskeleton from the cell edge to deep within the cell interior , especially at filament – filament junctions .

Phosphorylation of FLNa by protein kinase A increases its resistance to CALPAIN cleavage 52 and phosphorylation of chicken gizzard filamin by Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II decreases its actin - binding affinity 56 . But the physio - mechanoprotection function of filamins might be especially important in muscle tissues repeatedly sub - jected to powerful contractile forces . Regulation of filamins Although abundant evidence links filamins to cell sig - nalling pathways , it is unclear how the signalling reac - tions affect filamin function .

Transfection of one of the FLNa - deficient cell lines ( called M2 ) with FLNa cDNA yielded sublines that crawled with velocities propor - tional to the expression levels of the protein . Expressing levels that were higher than wild type decreased loco - motion rates again 63 . The M2 cells have an unstable surface 63 , 64 . Under conditions in which wild - type cultured cells extend one or a few flattened ruffling lamellae , M2 cells ( as well as other melanoma cell lines lacking FLNa ) protrude and retract multiple spherical aneurysms , described as blebs ( see movie online ) . The blebbing phenomenon results from an inability of the cell cortex that lacks FLNa to withstand internal hydrostatic pressures as efficiently as wild - type or rescued cells . The initiating event that leads to bleb protrusion is a weakening of the actin structure , because the blebs initially contain mostly monomeric , not filamentous , actin . Subsequently , actin polymerization and whatever actin crosslinking is achievable in the absence of FLNa limit bleb enlarge - ment and lead to retraction of the bleb structure . Eventually the FLNa - null cells can stabilize their mem - branes and flatten , although this stabilization occurs when the cells polymerize cellular actin to a level signif - icantly higher than that of filamin - expressing cells 65 . Mutations in the FLNa gene that completely block its expression are the cause of human periventricular heterotopia , an X - linked developmental disease 66 . In this disorder , females suffer from recurrent EPILEPTIC SEIZURES . Their brains have neuronal cell body accumu - lations along the LATERAL VENTRICLES as a result of failed neuronal migration to the cortex , and these foci are the sources of seizure activity . Heterotopia patients seem to have an unusually high incidence of vascular complica - tions as well . In most affected families , inheritance of the heterotopia trait is lethal to males in utero . This implies that essential embryonic cell migration can only occur in FLNa - expressing cells . Drosophila ovarian ring canals , which normally accommodate the mass movement of cytoplasm from nutritive nurse cells to the growing oocyte , fail to accu - mulate filamentous actin in cheerio mutants and do not grow to wild - type size . As a consequence , cytoplasmic flow to the oocyte is inadequate and leads to the pro - duction of small , nonviable eggs . In weaker alleles of cheerio , ring canals accumulate some , but not enough , filamentous actin . The intercellular bridges in the mutants ultimately degenerate and destabilize the nurse - cell plasma membranes . These data indicate that filamin in Drosophila ovarian germline cells might be essential for the recruitment of F - actin to ring canal rims and its organization at that site , and that the cells are unable to compensate for filamin loss with another actin - binding protein 11 , 12 , 67 . The simplest explanation for many of the structur - al and functional defects in filamin mutants is that they lack an efficient mechanism to create peripheral actin gel networks by orthogonal crosslinking of actin filaments . For example , the adhesive properties of logical importance of these phosphorylations requires elucidation . Life without filamin One look at bushes and trees is enough to convey how branched scaffoldings can produce a tremendous vari - ety of shapes . Such plasticity is essential for modulating cell shape and integrating the complex surface move - ments required for crawling . The amoeboid forms of Dictyostelium genetically depleted of filamin by homol - ogous recombination have difficulty extending broad surface protrusions and , as a result , have impaired locomotion and phagocytosis 57 – 59 . The actin networks in extended LAMELLAE of filamin - null amoebae are denser and less three - dimensional than those of wild - type amoebae . This appearance implies that the defi - cient cells compensate for the lack of filamin by increasing their content of polymerized actin 60 . Filamin - deficient Dictyostelium amoebae also have a diminished osmotic resistance to swelling induced by diminution of the osmotic pressure of the extracellular medium 61 , 62 .

EPILEPTIC SEIZURE Commonly known as fits , seizures are the result of uncontrolled bursts of neu - ronal activation in the brain that usually lead to repetitive motor activity , such as shaking of extremities .

FLNa - deficient melanoma cells seem roughly normal , although these cells have a 50 % reduction in bulk elasticity compared with FLNa - expressing cells 63 . Future directions Many questions remain to be answered about filamin function . How do filamins dimerize and orientate so as to organize actin filaments ? How do filamins , the Arp2 / 3 complex and other actin filament crosslinking proteins work together during cell protrusive activity ? In this context , it would be interesting to compare fil - amin - mediated actin - filament crosslinking with the actin branching caused by the Arp2 / 3 complex . How do cellular signals regulate filamin function and the numerous interactions between filamins and a variety of cellular partners ? At present , filamin research is in 1 .
