We have designed a context - aware mobile system to enable eﬃcient oﬄine access to online social media by prefetching , caching and disseminating content opportunistically when signal availability is detected . This system can measure , crowdsense and predict network characteristics , and then use these predictions of mobile network signal to schedule cellular access or device - to - device ( D2D ) communication . We propose several opportunistic optimization schemes to enhance controlled crowdsensing , resource constrained mobile prefetch , and D2D transmissions impacted by individual selﬁshness .

Accessing social media contents from Facebook , Twitter and various sites of news feeds has become a constant part of people’s daily routines . Because of the growing popularity and ubiquitous usage of mobile devices , people have become accustomed to accessing social content through their mobile devices and see it as a key way to receive updates and interact with others . This has resulted in the phenomenon that managing social interactions and obtaining up - to - the - minute bulletins via mobile devices is commonplace . Mobile devices roaming in diﬀerent geographical areas usually access online social networks through an Internet connection provided from cellular networks . However , with the increasing demands of fetching social content by mobile devices in cellular networks , a stable cellular service is not always available due to lack of coverage ( e . g . underground metro systems , rural areas , national parks such as Yellowstone , or other remote areas such as mountains and near shores ) or infrastructure overload ( e . g . busy shopping centers or stadiums during matches and concerts ) . Given intermittent cellular service in these scenarios , it is a challenge to provide agile mobile connectivity to access online social networks [ 14 ] . 1 . 1 Motivations Mobile prefetching has been proposed as a potential solution to facilitate mobile access to social networks for situations where people experience intermittent cellular service ( and hence do not have continuous access to social media content ) , while also helping to reduce energy consumption by only accessing data at times of high signal strength . Since when , what and how to prefetch / access social media data are all tightly coupled , the goal of mobile prefetching in our system is to exploit cellular coverage , and then cache and make content available to social media applications of mobile devices . The main issues related to eﬃcient mobile access of social media under intermittent cellular service are : 1 ) Mobile Access : the mobile access performance of mobile prefetching relies on an accurate prediction of cellular coverage . An opportunistic mobile signal is more likely to provide stable access to social media using signal estimation from controlled / supervised the collection and crowdsensing of data [ 4 , 5 , 36 ] , related to signal readings . Recent and historical information on mobile signal availability combined with location information can predict current and future cellular service , and networking activities can be coordinated based on these predictions . 2 ) Smart Caching : the smart caching for prefetching of social media content on resource - restricted mobile devices requires user - and device - context information . The user - context can predict the level of interest that users have for speciﬁc content . The device - context can provide real - time device status information which can include residual power , storage and data plan details to help manage resources . By exploiting this mobile and social context information [ 16 , 18 , 24 ] , one can provide a customized and optimized caching solution for prefetching content on individual mobile devices . Although mobile prefetching presents a feasible way to access and cache social media content in advance , before cellular service is getting worse , it requires the availability of strong cellular signals and direct connectivity to cellular networks during the prefetching process . When the correlation does not exist in mobile scenarios due to the lack of coverage or the infrastructure overload , we need to assist mobile users that experience disrupted network connection to be still able to access online social networks . To enhance mobile access to social media content in such situation , we could employ the device - to - device ( D2D ) communication to provide multi - hop connectivity and forward cached data which is prefetched by other mobile devices to the device which has lost cellular service . 3GPP has integrated the device - to - device ( D2D ) communication as an underlay to enhance the next generation cellular service known as LTE - A [ 6 ] . D2D communications require base stations ( BSs ) to distribute cellular Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 .

Connections of system components . resources to communicating user equipment ( UE ) pairs . With the allocated cellular resources , an UE is able not only to help to forward data from a BS or another UE to other UEs , but also to temporally store some data in its buﬀer and to wait for contact opportunities to send them out , which is corresponding to two D2D transmission modes known as D2D connected transmission and D2D opportunistic transmission , respectively . Social media content that has been cached by mobile prefetching could be forwarded to mobile devices losing cellular service by one of the two D2D transmission modes , depending on the availability of D2D connectivity . Note that mobile devices such as smartphones are UEs , and we use the term " UE " to represent a mobile device in this paper . The D2D connected transmission relies on the usual relaying technique which requires the end - to - end path , while the D2D opportunistic transmission utilizes the new paradigm of store - carry - forward which does not need the end - to - end path . Thus , in order to beneﬁt the whole system composed of mobile prefetching and D2D communication , these connected UEs , especially the UE that is involved in mobile prefetching , are required to devote some of their own resources such as power and storage to D2D communications in an unselﬁsh way [ 3 ] . UEs are held and controlled by humans , who are selﬁsh . If most mobile users are unwilling to participate in D2D communication , their UE resources cannot be fully utilized and the D2D assisted transmission system will not be able to operate successfully . Therefore , user selﬁshness is crucial to D2D communication and needs to be studied for the design of better D2D systems underlaying cellular networks . Fig . 1 states our motivation to integrate mobile prefetching and D2D communication as a holistic system , and their interaction on enhancing mobile access to online social networks under intermittent and disrupted networks . Speciﬁcally , after obtaining a crowdsensed cellular signal distribution , mobile prefetching functions with the support of BS that has eﬀective cellular coverage . The cached social media content from mobile prefetching can be accessed oﬄine by its mobile user , or forwarded to other UEs experiencing a long period of no cellular service by D2D communication . Two D2D transmission modes in terms of the availability of D2D connectivity provide an agile solution to deliver the cached content to UEs that can’t directly access cellular networks . These social media content are forwarded and shared among mobile users because of their common interests reﬂected in the social applications of their UEs . Meanwhile , these mobile users have certain selﬁsh inclinations on the mobile resources of their UEs during D2D communication ; the user selﬁshness has a great impact on the mobile performance of ubiquitous access to social networks . In general , we present a mobile social network access solution to cover intermittent and disrupted scenarios with various communication connections .

Wu et al . 1 . 2 Related Works No public data are available regarding the exact cellular coverage and bandwidth available for mobile prefetching . Projects such as OpenSignal [ 26 ] rely on GPS to collect , aggregate , and publish signal strength data , but their data are usually outdated and can’t reﬂect real - time or recent cellular service quality . Though the concept of crowdsensing has been used in the search of roadside unit ( RSU ) for mobile access in vehicular networks [ 40 , 44 ] , further action to crowdsense roadside signal charateristics after localizing RSUs is missing in these works . Bartendr [ 30 ] introduces the idea of measurement and prediction based on signal traces to get an estimate of what our signal strength will be ten minutes into the future . However , such estimates from existing databases are simplistic and error - prone since the server side lacks eﬃcient methods to evaluate the accuracy of the information contributed by various UEs from the same geographic area . Reliable learning schemes are needed to generate more accurate prediction results by fusing multiple estimates and inferring the reliability of each UE . Techniques to determine mobile prefetching based on network conditions , user preferences and phone status have been studied recently . EarlyBird [ 37 ] develops a prefetch scheduling scheme that eﬀectively integrates network access condition and user content preference to maximize delay reduction under resource constraints . O2SM [ 48 ] estimates social media items that are likely to be viewed by a user and provides hints to resource - eﬃcient scheduling and delivery . RichNote [ 35 ] tackles three important challenges in realizing rich notiﬁcation delivery , which is content and presentation utility modeling , notiﬁcation selection , and scheduling of delivery . PowerTutor [ 47 ] and BatteryExtender [ 25 ] have been designed to estimate and manage battery behavior . APPM [ 27 ] can adapt to power and app usage dynamics for prefetching on a phone . Nevertheless , all of these techniques assume constant / stable Internet access and have not speciﬁcally addressed the smart caching problem for both intermittent cellular service and disrupted network connection scenarios . When UEs have intermittent cellular service we must be able to identify the periods of connectivity during which UEs have to select the content to prefetch and distinguish between the types of social content displayed . Furthermore , if UEs have weak connections with BSs resulting in a long period of cellular service loss , we should extend the networking functions of UEs to support D2D communication , so that the cached social media content from mobile prefetching could be shared and forwarded between UEs . However , the unavoidable selﬁshness of UEs to a server as helpers for D2D communications underlaying cellular networks has not been studied in existing works . Ma et al . use an analytical framework to address inference management and resource allocation in D2D underlaying cellular networks [ 23 ] , and Chen et al . propose social information and social properties based cooperative D2D communications [ 3 ] but both of those investigations assume that UEs are always willing to act in a cooperative way . This assumption may lead to an overestimation of system performance and a misinterpretation of the relevant properties . Though user selﬁshness in terms of wireless forwarding and routing has been addressed in delay tolerant networks [ 19 ] , its impacts on the system design and performance of D2D transmission should be examined . 1 . 3 System Overview Fig . 2 presents an overview of our system to leverage the beneﬁts of mobile prefetching and D2D communication under intermittent cellular services . Since UEs have varying positions and ﬂuctuating access states , we use time frame to loosely mark a system period within which the access states and physical relationships of all the nodes remain nearly constant . The orange hexagons indicate the approximate cellular coverage areas of BSs ( B 1 , B 2 , B 3 and B 4 ) which can distribute cellular resources to their associated UEs for cellular direct transmissions or D2D transmissions . All the BSs have an eﬀective connection to the Internet , as shown by the dashed green line connecting BS and Internet provider .

System overview underlaying cellular network . of social networks , there are two natural groups of UEs – subscribers and helpers . Subscribers are UEs which request and download social media content in a given time frame , such as S 1 and S 2 in Fig . 2 . Each subscriber’s D2D communication area is denoted by a small purple circle . Helpers are UEs which do not request content in the same time frame , for example , H 1 and H 2 with D2D communication areas denoted by green - circles in Fig . 2 , serve as " relays " for subscribers , and participate in the two D2D transmission modes mentioned above – D2D connected transmission and D2D opportunistic transmission . Note that although all the UEs including subscribers and helpers are located in the cellular coverage areas of diﬀerent BSs , some UEs may encounter intermittent cellular service caused by coverage gaps or infrastructural overload at a speciﬁc position and time frame . For example , S 2 can get a strong cellular signal and corresponding service in the cellular coverage area of B 2 at t i , but confronts weak cellular signal and therefore has no cellular service in the cellular coverage area of B 4 at t i + δ . Considering this spatial - temporal changes of cellular services for diﬀerent UEs , we depict that a UE can obtain a strong cellular signal with the solid circle to present its D2D communication area , and dashed circle to reﬂect weak cellular signal as shown in Fig . 2 , respectively . Given strong ( usable ) cellular signals , both subscribers and helpers can use cellular direct transmission to prefetch social media content before the cellular signal becomes weak and corresponding cellular service is lost . These cached content from mobile prefetching of helpers can be later forwarded to other subscribers which have no cellular services due to a weak signal , through one of the two D2D transmission modes depending on the availability of D2D connectivity . Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 . Publication date : September 2017 . 114 : 6 • D . Wu et al . Speciﬁcally , in the context and framework of D2D communication presented by Fig . 2 , we classify mobile prefetching with the support of direct cellular connection as cellular direct transmission , and the process that some UEs ( helpers ) are involved in serving other UEs ( subscribers ) to access social networks through D2D communication as D2D transmission . Furthermore , the D2D transmission can be deﬁned as D2D connected transmission if a helper is able to forward the cached social media content from a BS or another helper to a subscriber using a multi - hop connection . Otherwise , the D2D transmission is named as D2D opportunistic transmission because the prefetched content needs to be stored in the buﬀer of a helper and wait for contact opportunities to send out to a nearby subscriber . The three types of transmission existed in our system are distinguished by lines with three diﬀerent color and their arrows indicate the direction of transmission , as shown in Fig . 2 . We illustrate several mobile social network access cases existed in the ﬁgure as follows using these transmissions as follows : • Cellular direct transmission : S 2 prefetches content from B 3 using cellular direct transmission at time t i before entering an area that has weak cellular signal from B 4 at time t i + δ . • D2D connected transmission : Because S 1 has weak cellular signal and thus no service from B 1 , H 2 can serve S 1 by establishing a path to immediately forward prefetched content from B 4 to S 1 using D2D connected transmission at time t i . • D2D opportunistic transmission : Since H 1 is serving S 1 across diﬀerent time frames , H 1 can prefetch content from B 2 at time t i , then carry and forward the content to S 1 , which has no cellular service at time t i + δ . • Coexistence of D2D transmissions : H 1 use D2D connected transmission and D2D opportunistic transmission at time t i + δ to enhance the content - downloading of S 1 . As an individual , an UE tends to show unwillingness when required to selﬂessly cache and forward data for other users . However , for acting as a helper in the D2D transmission of our system , an UE is required to contribute its battery resource in a D2D connected transmission , or both its battery and storage resources in D2D opportunistic transmission . Therefore , it is necessary to study the impact of user selﬁshness on the performance of mobile access to social networks during D2D transmissions . To address all the issues relevant to our system composed of mobile prefetching and D2D communication , the key techniques of this paper and their contributions are summarized as follows : • We design a mobile crowdsensing scheme with control items and reliability analysis for fast aggregation and dissemination of network conditions and opportunities in areas with unstable cellular service . These crowdsensed data can be used by UEs to predict network characteristics and prefetch social media content . • We develop a context - aware optimization solution for prefetching and caching social media contents based on network conditions , user preferences and UE capacities . This optimization has been implemented in a mobile system that can enable eﬃcient oﬄine access to online social media content under intermittent signal availability . • We propose an analytic framework which uses a time - varying graph model to study the D2D transmissions underlaying cellular networks . Our framework reveals the impacts of selﬁshness within the framework . To the best of our knowledge , it is the ﬁrst work to study the impact of selﬁshness in D2D systems . We have evaluated our framework using realistic mobile tests and large - scale trace analysis . Remark : Our previous work [ 41 ] presented a primitive implementation of mobile prefetching appli - cation with a simple framework to collect signals to facilitate mobile access . However , the framework does not contain reliable crowdsensing and context - aware mobile optimization .

Our system described in the paper signiﬁcantly diﬀers from these earlier works as follows : 1 ) The scenario considered in this paper has been updated to work in general environment with intermittent cellular service , whereas our previous works in [ 39 , 41 ] were limited to the London Un - derground scenario . 2 ) The crowdsensing scheme in [ 39 ] is based on a two - stage estimator , where the worker’s reliability is only evaluated by the control items . In contrast , our system in this paper proposes a joint estimator to score the workers based on their performance on both control items and target items , therefore can achieve more eﬃcient crowdsensing results with less cost of control items . 3 ) During mobile optimization of prefetching , the caching problem is modeled as a 0 - 1 knapsack problem in [ 39 ] ; this was a simpliﬁcation of the problem . In this paper the caching problem is redeﬁned as a multidimensional 0 - 1 knapsack problem ; a more accurate formulation . Additionally , we improve our solution from previous work by including a series of novel ﬁltering techniques . 4 ) As part of our improvements on previous works , D2D communication has been integrated into our system in this paper . We have presented a totally new analytic framework which uses a time - varying graph model to study the D2D transmissions underlaying cellular networks and the impact of selﬁshness in the system . 5 ) With respect to these new schemes in our system , corresponding experiments have been updated or added using realistic tests and large - scale trace analysis . The rest of this paper is organized as follows : Section 2 addresses crowdsensing of a cellular signal for mobile access during mobile prefetching . Section 3 illustrates the design of smart caching in mobile prefetching . Section 4 explains our D2D framework and its selﬁshness models . Section 5 evaluates system performance . Section 6 concludes our paper . 2 CROWDSENSING OF NETWORKING CHARACTERISTICS When mobile users experience intermittent cellular service their UEs should be able to run mobile prefetching to cache social media content at locations where the UEs have a direct cellular connection and usable cellular service . These cached content can be latter browsed by the users when they lose cellular support . Therefore it is necessary to obtain objective network measurements and an understanding of what cellular opportunities we have for building a stable mobile prefetching function [ 45 ] . As illustrated in Fig . 1 , the availability , and distribution of cellular signal data can be crowdsensed through the coordination between crowd server and crowd workers in advance . The mobile prefetching module can use these signal crowdsensing results as on - demand input to establish a stable cellular connection and achieve agile mobile access and caching performance . In this section , we present a crowdsensing method to aggregate cellular signal collections from reliable workers . This method can measure the intermittent availability of cellular signal strength and spatial - temporal networking characteristics to enable eﬀective mobile prefetching of social media content , therefore providing a reliable basis of opportunistic cellular connectivity for mobile users to oﬄine access to online social networks . 2 . 1 Mobile Signal Crowdsensing A UE based solution has been chosen for the collection of mobile signal data , such as signal strength . Recent versions of the Android operating system ( since 4 . 2 Jelly Bean ) provide functionality for measuring the signal strength ; this is retrieved through a variety of measures such as dBm or ASU . The ASU measure conforms to the relevant ETSI ( European Telecommunications Standard Institute ) speciﬁcation 10 . 3 . 0 [ 15 ] , where ASU values from 0 - 31 correspond to the range from - 113dBm to - 5dBm and an ASU of 99 represents an unknown or undetectable signal . Normally , an ASU value above 8 results in at least 3 bars signal Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 .

Illustration of mobile signal crowdsensing . indication on an Android smartphone , which is considered as a usable signal for mobile access of Internet . The data gathered from the dedicated collection runs of a UE could give us a good indication as to the levels of the mobile signal at various locations . However , there is only so much data that one person can collect and variances exist in the sample size of the data ; it would be better to allow the collection of mobile signal data from any number of UEs . Given these considerations , crowdsensing [ 21 , 22 , 46 ] , an approach to outsource or share sensing tasks among workers and then collect large amounts of sensing data from crowds ( workers ) , could be a promising solution for the aggregation and dissemination of the opportunistic signal data . We have implemented a crowd server to collect updated cellular data ( e . g . 3G , 4G ) from workers’ surrounding areas , and allows clients to easily get access to the signal readings and other information ( e . g . associated timing and location trace ) on synchronization . For example , as shown in Fig . 3 ( a ) , it is a subset of crowdsensed signal strength data from an underground metro line where mobile users usually Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 .

Areas shaded in dark gray are in tunnel sections and areas in white are in platform sections of the metro line . These crowdsensed ASU data are labeled with their collection timings and locations , therefore present an estimated performance of signal strength and its changes during a speciﬁc underground metro trip . As for workers during the crowdsensing process , they can use commodity UEs to collect surrounding signal strength data and upload the data to the crowd server . The Funf framework [ 7 ] that targets Android smartphones and oﬀers a built - in set of data probes can be chosen as the basic signal collection function . The framework probe is enabled ( but " sleeping " ) when the UE starts to run the framework . At regular intervals , a probe enters a running state to run its data collection code and upon completion returns to the enabled state until it is scheduled to run again . We have extended the Funf framework as a background application in the UE for measuring mobile signal characteristics . Fig . 3 ( b ) presents our implementation of such a signal tracker . The measured ASU values of surrounding signal strength over time as displayed by its statistic graph will be uploaded to the crowd server if the UE is a worker . Given a destination location ( e . g . the speciﬁc name of a metro platform ) , the signal tracker also can download crowdsensed data to estimate signal availability and schedule mobile prefetching along the route to the destination . Unfortunately , it is not always obvious how best to combine the workers to collect reliable crowdsensed data ; the fact that the workers have unknown and diverse levels of expertise introduces systematic process biases [ 11 ] . There are several factors that could account for the performance diﬀerence in data collected from crowd workers , such as UE hardware , current position , time of day and others . Therefore we need a way of scoring the workers , that is , estimating their expertise , bias , and any other associated parameters , in order to combine their answers more eﬀectively [ 12 , 13 , 20 ] . One way to score the workers is by using their past performance on tasks similar to the current task . However , this approach is not always practical . It is diﬃcult and costly for anonymous workers to maintain historical records . Another problem with this approach is that worker’s past tasks may be very diﬀerent from their current task , considering various traveling routes and collection locations . One alternative is to " seed " some control items with known answers into each worker’s assigned tasks , then score each worker’s reliability using these control items , and weight their answers according to their reliability [ 32 , 42 , 43 ] . The operation of using control items to evaluate worker’s reliability is illustrated in Fig . 3 ( c ) . The control items are chosen from the values of mobile signal strength ( ASU values ) at speciﬁc locations and timings , which can be obtained by cellular service provider or collected by trusted workers that have been veriﬁed already by the crowd server . The correct answers to these control items are known to the crowd server , but not known to a potential worker that needs reliability evaluation . When the worker participates in the crowdsensing process , the UE ﬁrst reports it’s historic and current spatial - temporal information to the crowd server . The crowd server then maps the information with its database and selects (cid:2) items with similar spatial - temporal attributes , including k control items ( correct answers known by the crowd server ) and (cid:2) − k target items ( correct answers unknown by the crowd server ) , and sends these items back to the worker . The worker’s UE correspondingly obtains signal strength measurements from its signal tracker , as recorded by the signal graph over time , to answer these items . These answers will be later uploaded to the crowd server for correctness veriﬁcation , and further used in joint estimation ( see Section 2 . 2 ) to evaluate the worker’s reliability . The whole process of mobile crowdsensing that uses control items to improve the reliability of aggregated mobile signal data for mobile prefetching can be formulated as follows . Assume there is a set T of target items ( data to be collected by workers ) , associated with a set of labels μ T : = { μ i : i ∈ T } whose true values μ ∗ T we want to estimate . In addition , we have a set C of control ( or training ) items whose true labels μ ∗ C : = { μ ∗ i : i ∈ C } are known . We denote the set of workers by W ; Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 . Publication date : September 2017 . 114 : 10 • D . Wu et al . each worker j is associated with a parameter ν ∗ j that characterizes their performance bias . We denote the complete vector of worker parameters by ν : = { ν ∗ j : j ∈ W } . Denote by n t the number of target items and m the workers . Let ∂ i be the set of workers assigned to item i , and ∂ tj ( and ∂ cj ) be the set of target ( and control ) items labeled by worker j . The assignment relationship between the workers and the target items can be represented by a bipartite graph G t = ( T , W , E t ) , where there is an edge ( ij ) ∈ E t iﬀ item i is assigned to worker j . Let r be the number of workers assigned each target item , and let each worker answer (cid:2) items including k control items and (cid:2) − k target items , so that r = m ( (cid:2) − k ) / n t . Denote by x ij the label we collect from worker j for item i . In general , we can assume that x ij is a random variable drawn from a probability distribution p ( x ij | μ ∗ i , ν ∗ j ) . It can be modelled by a Gaussian model : x ij = μ ∗ i + b ∗ j + ξ ij , where ξ ij ∼ N ( 0 , σ ∗ 2 ) , μ ∗ i is the quantity of interest of item i , b ∗ j is the bias of worker j , and σ ∗ 2 is the variance . This Gaussian model captures heterogeneous biases across workers that are commonly observed in practice , for example in their UEs’ perception of signal strength ; these biases can have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the estimation of reliability . Note that the biases are not identiﬁable solely from the crowdsensed labels { x ij } , making it necessary to add some control items when decoding the answers . 2 . 2 Crowdsensing with Control Items To incorporate control items into the mobile crowdsensing process , we introduce a consensus method that uses a joint maximum likelihood estimator to score the workers based on their performance on both control items and target items . We present the method in terms of a general model p ( x ij | μ i , ν j ) here ; the updates for the Gaussian model can be reduced to simple weighted averaging updates , see Algorithm 1 . Algorithm 1 Joint Estimation with Ground Truth ( for Gaussian Model ) Input : The labels { x ij } , and true labels μ ∗C of the control items .

This is because the labels x ij provide information on μ ∗ i through the probabilistic distribution p ( x ij | μ ∗ i , ν ∗ j ) .

Considering the intermittent connectivity in our scenario , the total number of mobile signal data each worker can collect is limited . To further improve crowdsensing eﬃciency we would like to learn the reliability of each worker using fewer control items so that each worker can provide answers for more target items . In other words , a rule of thumb for crowdsensing practitioners is expected to achieve fast crowdsensing using a minimum ( optimal ) number of control items . Correspondingly , the computational question in fast crowdsensing is to construct an estimator ˆ μ T of the true labels μ ∗T based on the crowdsensed labels { x ij } , such that the expected mean square error ( MSE ) on the target items , E (cid:5) | | ˆ μ T − μ ∗T | | 2 (cid:6) , can be minimized by the optimal choice of k . Here we give theoretical results for this problem by studying the properties of the joint estimator with our Gaussian model . We ﬁrst introduce some matrix notation . Let A t be the adjacency matrix of bipartite assignment graph G t between workers and the target items , where a ij = 1 if item i is labeled by worker j . Assume r i is the number of workers assigned to i - th target item and (cid:2) tj and (cid:2) cj is the number of target items and control items assigned to j - th worker , respectively . Let R t : = diag ( { r i : i ∈ T } ) be the diagonal matrix formed by the degree sequence of the target items , and similarly deﬁne L t = diag ( { (cid:2) tj : j ∈ W } ) and L c = diag ( { (cid:2) cj : j ∈ W } ) . Theorem 1 . For the Gaussian model with x ij = μ ∗ i + b ∗ j + ξ ij , where ξ ij are i . i . d . noise drawn from N ( 0 , σ ∗ 2 ) , the expected MSE of the joint estimator deﬁned in Eq . ( 1 ) is E [ (cid:2) i ∈T | | ˆ μ i − μ ∗ i | | 2 / n t ] = σ ∗ 2 tr ( ( R t − A t ( L t + L c ) − 1 A T t ) − 1 ) / n t , ( 2 ) where " tr " is the trace of a matrix . If A t is regular , with R t = rI and L t = ( (cid:2) − k ) I , where I is the identity matrix , this simpliﬁes : E [ (cid:2) i ∈T | | ˆ μ i − μ ∗ i | | 2 / n t ] = σ ∗ 2 1 r tr ( ( I − (cid:2) − k (cid:2) W ) − 1 ) / n t , ( 3 ) where W = R − 1 t A t L − 1 t A Tt . Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 . Publication date : September 2017 . 114 : 12 • D . Wu et al . Proof . Assume B : = I − R − 1 t A t ( L t + L c ) − 1 A Tt is invertible . The solution of the joint estimator on the Gaussian model is ˆ μ T = μ ∗T + B − 1 z T , where z i = 1 r i (cid:2) j ∈ ∂ i ( ξ ij − ¯ ξ j ) , and ¯ ξ j = 1 (cid:2) cj + (cid:2) tj (cid:2) i (cid:6) ∈ ∂ cj ∪ ∂ tj ξ ij and ξ ij = x ij − μ ∗ i − b ∗ j for ∀ i ∈ T . We obtain Eq . ( 2 ) by calculating Var ( ˆ μ T ) . (cid:2) Eq . ( 3 ) establishes an explicit connection between MSE and the spectral structure of the bipartite graph G t . According to the theory on the second eigenvalue of random regular graphs introduced in [ 8 ] , we consider the eigenvalues 1 = λ 1 ≥ λ 2 ≥ · · · ≥ 0 of W : = R − 1 t A t L − 1 t A Tt , where the second largest eigenvalue λ 2 famously characterizes the connectivity of the graph G t . Roughly speaking , G t has better connectivity if λ 2 is small , and visa versa . Observe that tr ( ( I − (cid:2) − k (cid:2) W ) − 1 ) = n t (cid:2) i = 1 ( 1 − (cid:2) − k (cid:2) λ i ) − 1 ≤ (cid:2) k + n t − 1 1 − (cid:3) − k (cid:3) λ 2 . ( 4 ) Therefore , the joint estimator performs better when λ 2 is small , i . e . when the graph is strongly connected . Intuitively , better connectivity " couples " the items and workers more tightly together , making it easier not to make mistakes during inference . Besides hoping for a small error , one may also want the assignment graph to be sparse , i . e . use fewer labels . Graphs that are both sparse and strongly connected are known as expander graphs and have been found universally important in areas like robust computer networks , error - correcting codes , and communication networks . It is well known that large sparse random regular graphs are good expanders [ 8 ] , and hence a near - optimal allocation strategy for crowdsensing [ 17 ] . On such graphs , we can also estimate the optimal k in a simple form . Theorem 2 . Assume A t is a random regular bipartite graph , and n t = m . We have that E [ (cid:2) i ∈T | | ˆ μ i − μ ∗ i | | 2 / n t ] = σ ∗ 2 (cid:2) − k (cid:5) n t − 1 n t ( 1 + O ( 1 (cid:2) ) ) + (cid:2) n t k (cid:6) , ( 5 ) with probability one as n t → ∞ . If in addition (cid:2) → ∞ , the optimal k that minimizes Eq . ( 5 ) can be derived as following : k ∗ = (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:2) 2 / n t + (cid:2) 2 / n t 2 + 1 / 4 − (cid:2) / n t − 1 / 2 (cid:13) ≈ (cid:2) / √ n t . Proof . Use Eq . ( 4 ) and the bound given in [ 28 ] for λ 2 of large random regular bipartite graphs . (cid:2) Therefore , the optimal choice of control items ( k ) to minimize the expected MSE should scale as O ( (cid:2) / √ n t ) when using joint estimators . That is , the optimal k of the joint estimator scales linearly w . r . t . budget (cid:2) . In addition , the optimal k for the joint estimator also decreases as the total number n t of target items increases . Because n t is usually quite large in practice , the number of control items is usually very small . In particular , as n t → ∞ , we have k ∗ = 1 , that is , there is no need for control items beyond ﬁxing the unidentiﬁability issue of the biases . Our system employs fast crowdsensing to aggregate the most recent signal readings and provide updated signal data to users on synchronization . The crowdsensed dataset can be used to determine the performance diﬀerence among cellular base stations , and increase the reliability of signal traces at speciﬁc times and locations . Through crowdsensing coordination between servers and UEs involved in the process , previous signal traces can be obtained from the remote dataset in advance . UEs can then use these readings in conjunction with current location and future movements to prefetch online social media at potential areas along the route that have usable cellular signals .

Meanwhile , since cellular service is not always stable in the intermittent scenarios we have described , having mobile users constantly check social networks is a drain on limited UE resources . Therefore , besides network conditions , we also need to consider other mobile context factors to achieve smart caching smart caching during the mobile prefetching process . In this section , we have designed an optimization solution for mobile users’ UEs to detect cellular service opportunities by learning crowdsensed signal traces and choose optimal social media items to cache based on the context of the network condition , user preference , and UE’s status . 3 . 1 Mobile Cost of Prefetching Social and news - feed style networks perform metadata - based learning to sort each user’s news - feed into order according to their " user - post " aﬃnity . However , such an ordering based on the user’s click history assumes ubiquitous mobile connectivity and unlimited UE resources . For example , Facebook does not factor bandwidth vs . size of news - items into their ordering algorithm . We can solve the prefetching and caching problem by intelligently using the ordering calculated by social networks and imposing on this ordering the constraints from the low - connectivity environment and limited resources on UE , e . g . power , storage , and data plan . Speciﬁcally , the problem degenerates into a multidimensional 0 − 1 knapsack problem ( 0 − 1 MKP ) ( where dimensions refer to resource constraints ) . Let I = ( i | I | , . . . , i 1 ) be the sequence of aﬃnity ordered news - items . The ordering implies the following : Q ( i i − 1 ) < Q ( i i ) where Q ( i x ) is the likelihood that news - item i ( which is the x ’th item returned by social networks ) will be viewed by the user . Assume that the media - caching module is allocated a ﬁxed block of available storage space ( M ) and a ﬁxed energy budget ( E ) . Finally , assume that there is a ﬁxed data - plan budget which indicates the number of bytes which may be received by the cellular interface for the purpose of caching . Each time the optimization is run E may be set to a diﬀerent value , for example , if E is limited to 5 % of the power available to the UE at the time of its operation this value will be diﬀerent each time the optimization is run . Further , suppose that the UE may trigger the caching application intelligently , for example prior to the user’s entry into areas of lower connectivity . Cached content can be removed at ﬁxed time intervals , for example , the amount of time that one will be traveling to the area . Finally , assume functions f ( i , t ) and д ( i ) which returns the power and storage expenditures respectively for downloading and caching news - item i at time t . We adopt energy models from [ 2 ] . The energy cost under cellular networks is modeled in Eq . ( 6 ) : e cell ( i , t ) = R cell + c cell × s i bw cell ( t ) + e tail , ( 6 ) where : • R cell is a constant indicating the ramp energy cost for a given cellular interface . • c cell is a power coeﬃcient for the interface . • bw cell ( t ) is the bandwidth available on the cellular interface at time t . • s i is the size in bytes of data item i . • e tail is the estimate of cellular tail energy costs . Since contents are pre - fetched in batches , we have e tail = c tail × T tail l avд . Where c tail is the power coeﬃcient for cellular tail energy , T tail is the typical cellular tail time , and l avд is the history average of the number of contents downloaded in a batch by the pre - fetcher . To predict cellular tail consumption for on - demand Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 . Publication date : September 2017 . 114 : 14 • D . Wu et al . fetches we have e tail = c tail × min ( T inactive , T tail ) , where T inactive is the history average of the idle period between two consecutive content requests from the user . We assume that bw cell ( t ) = 0 when no cell connectivity is available at time t . With regards to data plan usage , we deﬁne D ( t ) to represent the number of bytes allocated as available for caching from the cellular data plan at time t . D ( t ) is monotonically non - increasing ; when more cache data is downloaded through the cellular connection at time t − 1 , D ( t ) will decrease by the amount of data that was downloaded at time t − 1 . Clearly the storage cost of item i is M ( i ) = s i . Note that the bandwidth at some time t is a function of the signal strength to the available wireless interface at t . In this optimization , we assume that all news items will be cached in a single batch with the bandwidth available at the time that the optimization is initiated . As the downloads will be batched , the ramp and tail energy costs will be incurred once per batch . 3 . 2 Mobile Optimization of Prefetching As mentioned earlier , certain optimization constants will be set by an UE before prefetching occurs . Suppose that it is run at time t . We can formulate power expenditure f ( i , t ) = e cell ( i , t ) , if D ( t ) − s i ≥ 0 ; otherwise f ( i , t ) = ∞ . We also formulate storage expenditure д ( i ) = s i . The assumptions about download - ing news - items for caching is based on the cellular availability at time t . Note that e cell ( t ) is dependent on bw cell ( t ) as described in Section 3 . 1 . The problem is now a 0 − 1 MKP . In the problem formulated in Eq . ( 7 ) only the x i are variables ( which are news items to cache ) , the remaining terms are constants derived at run time . max | I | (cid:2) i = 1 ( | I | − i ) × x i , s . t . | I | (cid:2) i f ( i , t ) × x i ≤ E , | I | (cid:2) i д ( i ) × x i ≤ M , x i ∈ { 0 , 1 } . ( 7 ) where t is constant at the time the optimization is evaluated . The 0 − 1 MKP is an NP - hard problem , and no eﬃcient polynomial time approximation scheme can be used to generate a solution with bounded sub - optimality in polynomial time ( unless P = NP ) . Our problem has the additional complication that the collection of social media items available at any one time can be presumed to be inﬁnite . Given the diﬃculty of the optimization task , the best reasonable solution method will be a heuristic with unbounded sub - optimality , and we must relax the available list of items to some ﬁnite value to make the problem tractable even for such a heuristic . Balasubramanian et al . [ 2 ] show that only the ﬁrst 10 results for a search query originating from a UE have a non - negligible likelihood of user interaction , and this result also applies to news - item recommender systems . Furthermore , as the sub - sequences of news items returned from social networks are non - increasing in value our algorithm should not consider news items too late in the order . We restrict our problem to consider only 20 highly ranked news items , and then solve this restricted problem with a branch and bound procedure to arrive at a feasible solution for our original problem . Shih’s [ 31 ] successful and eﬃcient application of branch and bound to MKPs larger than the ones we are considering motivates our choice for branch and bound as our optimization technique .

From Intermittent to Ubiquitous : Enhancing Mobile Access to Online Social Networks with . . . • 114 : 15 Considering at a given instance only the top 10 retrieved items have a non - negligible likelihood of being interacted with . Our caching optimization acts as a ﬁlter on the item sequence returned . The sequence cached after ﬁltration is a sub - sequence of the newsfeed . The ﬁnal step in our optimization is a branch and bound optimization which will ﬁlter out news items that are too resource intensive given their order in the sequence . However , branch and bound cannot be applied to an inﬁnite collection where the cost of any item in the collection cannot be predicted . To set up a useful and solvable optimization problem with a ﬁnite number of variables we apply the ﬁrst ﬁlter out items previously cached and consumed , then we remove overly resource intensive or poor quality items . These ﬁlters decrease the number of variables in the optimization to a size that can be solved too quickly and eﬀectively . Metadata regarding news items arrives at the optimizer in batches ; the arriving metadata may reference pieces of content already in cache . Thus we must remove all news items from consideration which are already in the cache prior to running our optimization . As metadata requests are relatively cheap when batched we request 100 metadata items at optimization time ( the largest number allowed in the Facebook API [ 1 ] ) . If we detect that 10 or more of the received metadata items reference news items already in the cache we request a further 100 metadata items until our collection of candidate news - items has size at least 90 , and at most 100 ( with preference given to earlier news items ) . The range 90 to 100 is chosen somewhat arbitrarily . The intent is to select a large number of items of which roughly the best half will have the possibility of being cached . Prior to running our branch and bound optimization , we must address the fact that while the news items arrive in non - decreasing order of user aﬃnity , the order does not take the energy and memory expenditures into account in the ordering . By selecting only the highly ordered items returned by social networks we may be biasing the result of the branch and bound optimization in favor of interesting but resource intensive items . To ﬁx this bias we further ﬁlter news items by applying Toyoda’s [ 33 ] primal eﬀective gradient method on the collection of metadata items returned from social networks . We use the primal eﬀective gradient method to ﬁlter our collection of unique news items into a set of 40 candidate items ( the 40 news items with highest eﬀective gradients ) . Toyoda’s method is an improvement heuristic that achieves both a feasible solution and an approximate ranking of the variables reﬂecting their quality when included in a solution . We use this ordering to ﬁlter all but the best 40 items . We do not make use of the approximate solution given by Toyoda’s algorithm , instead , we use only the approximate ranking ; this means that even though we select 40 items at this stage , a solution that caches all 40 items may still be infeasible . Finally , we use the 40 or fewer remaining items to formulate a 0 − 1 MKP optimization problem . We run a branch and bound approach ( a backtracking tree search ) inﬂuenced by the implementation in [ 31 ] to achieve a solution of our 0 − 1 MKP with reasonable quality . The branch and bound search returns to us the ﬁnal set of news items which we will request from social networks for caching . The outline of our optimization procedure can be found in Algorithm 3 . Remark : Ideally the optimization should run as an on - demand background service based on cellular connectivity events when the UE is under intermittent cellular service , and it should be automatically turned on and oﬀ without any explicit user intervention . By using the location information and the Android Geofencing APIs [ 10 ] the UE can deﬁne geographical areas which can trigger actions within applications . In these geographical areas , stable cellular services can be guaranteed in terms of the ASU value of the cellular signal , and the availability and distribution of usable cellular signal strength can be obtained in advance from the crowd server , as described in Section 2 . 1 . When users enter into an area with connectivity from an area of no connectivity this event triggers the caching module of our application to attempt to sense the available news items and to optimize the set of news items to be cached , then to cache them . In summary , the mobile optimization is triggered as follows : Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 . Publication date : September 2017 . 114 : 16 • D . Wu et al . • Obtain crowdsensing data : The signal distribution information is downloaded from the crowd server and updated locally in a UE . A list of crowdsensed coordinates of usable signal is used to generate and register geofence areas ; these geographical areas information will be cached in the UE for mobile prefetching . • Run optimization : When the UE enters the geofence area gaining eﬀective cellular service con - nectivity after a period of being disconnected triggers mobile prefetching , and thereafter enables optimization and caching . • Customization : A mobile user may specify a ﬁxed interval used for mobile prefetching after the UE entering a geofence area , and the optimization should stop running after passing the interval . Otherwise , the mobile prefetching is disabled when the UE detects no cellular service again . The size of geographical area for geofencing also can be customized by mobile users . Memory and energy constraints are recalculated at the beginning of each optimization . When the constraints are speciﬁed originally by the mobile users , they are speciﬁed as relative values ( percentage of the full energy and memory capacity of the UE ) . These relative constraints are translated into absolute constraints prior to each optimization and take into account the resources at the time of the optimization . We will explicitly illustrate the settings of these customization options in Section 5 . 1 . Algorithm 3 Optimize Input : E / / Millijoules available for caching .

Illustration of a dynamic graph model . UEs may experience a long period of no cellular service because of disrupted network connection . To ensure eﬀective mobile access to social media content in such situation , our system presents a D2D communication framework underlaying cellular networks where UEs are enabled to share and forward content cached from mobile prefetching to other UEs that have no cellular service . As shown in Fig . 1 , the mobile prefetching module of our system has been extended to support two D2D communication modes known as D2D connected transmission and D2D opportunistic transmission . The social media contents are shared across mobile users because of their common social interests reﬂected in feeds ( ( e . g . text , image , video ) ) of the social applications in their UEs , and forwarded along agile connections provided by the two D2D transmission modes . Meanwhile , an individual UE acting as a helper in D2D communication tends to show unwillingness when it is required to selﬂessly cache and forward social media content to other UEs . This type of selﬁshness can be referred as individual selﬁshness . In accordance with the two D2D transmission modes , the individual selﬁshness can be divided into two components , namely connected selﬁshness and opportunistic selﬁshness , and this selﬁshness has a great impact on the social network access performance of both D2D transmission modes . In this section , we present our D2D communication framework underlaying cellular networks and analyze the impact of user selﬁshness in our D2D framework , to quantify optimal performance achievable under diﬀerent D2D transmission modes . 4 . 1 Time - varying Graph Model If there are b BSs labeled as B = { B 1 , B 2 , · · · , B b } , h helpers labeled as H = { H 1 , H 2 , · · · , H h } and s sub - scribers labeled as S = { S 1 , S 2 , · · · , S s } , a static graph similar to Fig . 2 with b + h + s nodes can be drawn for every time frame . We can use directed edges to represent the data ﬂows between nodes in a time frame . Speciﬁcally , the edges of outgoing D2D opportunistic ﬂows are from willing helpers to subscribers or to other helpers in a given time frame or to themselves in the successive time frame , which represent the contents stored in the helpers’ buﬀer . Similarly , the edges of D2D connected transmissions are from BSs via some voluntary helpers to subscribers , and the edges of cellular direct transmissions are directly from BSs to subscribers , all within the same time frame . Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 . Publication date : September 2017 . 114 : 18 • D . Wu et al . D2D opportunistic transmissions enable data ﬂow across time frames and hence makes it possible to model the time evolution of this time - varying system by linking the static graphs of diﬀerent time frames . Let the entire time period be divided into n time frames . We ﬁrst generate n graphs , one for each time frame , and then link them with directed edges to represent data ﬂow in buﬀers across time frames . Fig . 4 includes all the possible transmission modes ( cellular direct , D2D connected and D2D opportunistic transmissions ) , where BSs and UEs are represented by vertices . Moreover , directed edges are added to vertices , which represent the data ﬂow of cellular direct transmission and / or D2D communication . Furthermore , we attribute weights to directed edges to represent the magnitudes of data ﬂows . Thus , each directed edge in the same row ( time frame ) in Fig . 4 is one of the following forms : black arrow for cellular direct transmission , a blue arrow for D2D connected transmission , and red arrow for D2D oppor - tunistic transmission . Each edge in the same time frame is associated with a positive value representing the amount of data transmitted within this time frame , bound by the product of the time - frame duration and the temporal transmission rate . A directed edge across time frames in Fig . 4 is bound by the buﬀer size that the particular helper is willing to contribute and , therefore , is linked to node selﬁshness . For the graphic conciseness , we omit the weights on all the directed edges in Fig . 4 . It is worth emphasizing that this weighted connected dynamic graph explicitly takes into account user selﬁshness . To quantitatively reveal the impacts of user selﬁshness in the two D2D modes , both incoming ﬂow and outgoing ﬂow of each node in each time frame are divided into two ﬂows – one for D2D connected transmission and one for D2D opportunistic transmission . • Connected incoming ﬂow : is the component of ﬂow incoming to a node via the D2D connected transmission . If the node is a helper , the ﬂow will be forwarded immediately after reception to another node and does not occupy the helper’s buﬀer . The amount of data in this ﬂow for helper H i in time frame l is denoted v l ( H i ) . • Opportunistic incoming ﬂow : is the component of ﬂow incoming to a node via a D2D opportunistic transmission . If the node is a helper , it will be stored in the helper’s buﬀer for opportunistic transmission at some later time frame . The data amount of this ﬂow for helper H i in time frame l is denoted w l ( H i ) . • Connected outgoing ﬂow : is the component of ﬂow outgoing from a node that is received and forwarded immediately by a helper . This ﬂow is not from the helper’s buﬀer and is equal to the incoming ﬂow at the node . The amount of data from helper H i to helper H j or to subscriber S j in time frame l is denoted as x l ( H i , H j ) or x l ( H i , S j ) • Opportunistic outgoing ﬂow : is the component of ﬂow outgoing from a helper that is from the helper’s buﬀer . The data in this kind of ﬂow were received in a previous time frame and have been stored in the helper’s buﬀer for one or more time frames . The data amount from helper H i to helper H j or subscriber S j in time frame l is denoted as y l ( H i , H j ) or y l ( H i , S j ) . Note that connected and opportunistic selﬁshness impacts the connection states of each helper by imposing constraints on outgoing ﬂows instead of incoming ﬂows . 4 . 2 D2D Selﬁshness Modes Mobile users in proximity are able to share common objects between them , in particular , common updates from common feeds ( this includes text , images , video , etc ) . When two users are subscribed to common entities the news items generated by these entities can be identiﬁed uniquely and so detected and passed from user to user using D2D communications . The " small world " phenomenon which is well studied , both in the context of social networks generally , and in the online social network sites , for example , Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 . Publication date : September 2017 . From Intermittent to Ubiquitous : Enhancing Mobile Access to Online Social Networks with . . . • 114 : 19 Facebook ensures that with high likelihood any two users will have at least some common associations ( and thus common feed items ) . See for example Wilson et al . [ 38 ] . In the time - varying graph model , whether a connected outgoing ﬂow or an opportunistic outgoing ﬂow is allowed to establish depends on two factors – the physical access states between node pairs and the selﬁshness of UE senders – a very selﬁsh helper may , for example , refuse to participate in some possible transmissions . Since the access states within each time frame remain constant , in each time frame , a Boolean matrix , referred to as Connection Matrix , can be used to describe the access states of UE pairs . In this matrix , the row number of an element speciﬁes a helper , and the column number of an element speciﬁes a helper or subscriber , while the Boolean value of an element represents whether a connection between this node pairs is allowed or not . Similarly , another Boolean matrix , referred to as Cover Matrix , can be used to store the access states between BSs and UEs . In this matrix , the row number of an element speciﬁes a BS and the column number of an element speciﬁes a helper or subscriber . If we denote Connection Matrix as N and Cover Matrix as V for b BSs , h helpers and s subscribers , then : size ( N ) = h × ( h + s ) , size ( V ) = b × ( h + s ) . ( 8 ) Further denote the set of UEs as UE = { UE 1 , UE 2 , · · · , UE h + s } = H + S . Then , for example , if the ( i , j ) - th element in N is N i , j = TRUE , the helper H i is able to establish D2D connection with the UE UE j , where 1 ≤ i ≤ h and 1 ≤ j ≤ h + s . If the ( i , j ) - th element in V is V i , j = FALSE , on the other hand , the BS B i is unable to transmit data to UE UE j , where 1 ≤ i ≤ b and 1 ≤ j ≤ h + s . As mentioned previously , a helper may be unwilling to participate in D2D communication because of its connected selﬁshness and / or opportunistic selﬁshness . To model the UEs’ unwillingness to participate in D2D communications , we enable helpers to randomly forbid any potential D2D connected or opportunistic transmission that it may establish . For possible D2D connected transmissions , the forbiddance occurs according to a probability p which we refer to as " connected selﬁshness probability " , while for possible D2D opportunistic transmissions , the forbidding probability q is referred to as " opportunistic selﬁshness probability " . Then , two random Boolean matrices , referred to as Connected Selﬁshness Matrix R and Opportunistic Selﬁshness Matrix G , respectively , can be generated for each time frame , which store the random forbiddance to the two respective D2D modes . Clearly , size ( R ) = size ( G ) = h × ( h + s ) . ( 9 ) More speciﬁcally , let p i , j be the connected selﬁshness probability of helper h i for UE UE j . Then ( i , j ) - th element R i , j of R represents whether the connected D2D transmission mode from h i to UE j is allowed , namely , (cid:8) Pr (cid:9) R i , j = FALSE (cid:10) = p i , j , Pr (cid:9) R i , j = TRUE (cid:10) = 1 − p i , j , 1 ≤ i ≤ h , 1 ≤ j ≤ h + s . ( 10 ) Similarly , let q i , j be the opportunistic selﬁshness probability of h i for UE j . Then ( i , j ) - th element G i , j of G represents whether the opportunistic D2D transmission mode from h i to UE j is allowed , namely , (cid:8) Pr (cid:9) G i , j = FALSE (cid:10) = q i , j , Pr (cid:9) G i , j = TRUE (cid:10) = 1 − q i , j , 1 ≤ i ≤ h , 1 ≤ j ≤ h + s .

By combining Connection Matrix with Connected Selﬁshness Matrix and Opportunistic Selﬁshness Matrix , respectively , we acquire two new matrices M and W according to M i , j = N i , j & R i , j , 1 ≤ i ≤ h , 1 ≤ j ≤ h + s , ( 12 ) W i , j = N i , j & G i , j , 1 ≤ i ≤ h , 1 ≤ j ≤ h + s , ( 13 ) which explicitly model the selﬁshness in the D2D communication underlaying system . In our proposed graph model , whether a D2D connected connection is allowed to establish or not at a given time frame is determined by M matrix of this time frame , while the permission of D2D opportunistic connection depends on W matrix . Note that the constraints of Connection Matrix are imposed on output ﬂows rather than input ﬂows . 4 . 3 D2D Optimization In time frame l , the incoming ﬂow of helper H i via its own buﬀer from previous time frame l − 1 is denoted as a l ( H i ) , while the outgoing ﬂow of H i via its own buﬀer to successive time frame l + 1 is denoted as b l ( H i ) . Before the ﬁrst time frame , namely , at time frame l = 0 , the initial buﬀer of each helper is empty , i . e . a 0 ( H i ) = 0 , ∀ i . Let the total amount of the data received by all the subscribers be D in the time period considered . We set maximizing the total amount of the data received by all the subscribers in a time frame as the objective , and formulate the optimization problem as follow : max (cid:11) l (cid:12) (cid:11) i , j (cid:9) x l ( H i , S j ) + y l ( H i , S j ) (cid:10) + (cid:11) k , j c l ( B k , S j ) (cid:13) , s . t . y l ( H i , H j ) ≤ a l ( H i ) , ∀ i , j , l , y l ( H i , S j ) ≤ a l ( H i ) , ∀ i , j , l , w l ( H i ) + a l ( H i ) ≥ b l ( H i ) , ∀ i , l , v l ( H i ) = (cid:11) j x l ( H i , H j ) + (cid:11) k x l ( H i , S k ) , ∀ i , l , y l ( H i , S j ) ≤ a l ( H i ) , ∀ i , j , l , (cid:11) j (cid:9) y l ( H j , H i ) + x l ( H j , H i ) (cid:10) + (cid:11) k c l ( B k , H i ) = w l ( H i ) + v l ( H i ) , ∀ i , l . ( 14 ) where c l ( B k , S j ) denotes the data amount transmitted through the ﬂow via cellular direct transmission from BS B k to subscriber S j in time frame l . In addition , as described in Section 4 . 1 , x l ( H i , H j ) and x l ( H i , S j ) denote the data amount transmitted through outgoing ﬂow via D2D connected transmission from helper H i to helper H j and to subscriber S j in time frame l , respectively . y l ( H i , H j ) and y l ( H i , S j ) denote the data amount transmitted through outgoing ﬂow via D2D opportunistic transmission from helper H i to helper H j and to subscriber S j in time frame l , respectively . v l ( H i ) denotes the data amount transmitted through incoming ﬂow via D2D connected transmission for helper H i in time frame l . w l ( H i ) denotes the data amount transmitted through incoming ﬂow via D2D opportunistic transmission for helper H i in time frame l . The transmission rate between each node pair must meet the resource constraint , and the total transmit - ted data amount of each edge is constrained by the product of the transmission rate and the time - frame duration . Moreover , considering connection states and user selﬁshness , the transmitted content ﬂows must be strictly circumscribed within the connected and willing UEs in each time frame , as described by the matrix V , M and W in D2D selﬁshness modes introduced in Section 4 . 2 .

Fortunately , we can use the reformulation - linearization technique ( RLT ) [ 14 ] to transform those nonlin - ear constraints into linear expressions and , consequently , we can use the existing optimization toolkits , such as CPLEX [ 3 ] to solve this constrained maximization problem . By solving this constrained maxi - mization problem , we obtain the total amount of data that can be transmitted successfully , namely , the maximized objective value . Therefore , we can derive the total achievable transmission rate by dividing the data amount with the duration . Remark : The time - varying graph model and the formulated optimization framework allow us to understand the impact of user selﬁshness on the performance of D2D communications and to quantify the optimal system performance achievable under diﬀerent levels of user selﬁshness , which are vital for aiding the current process of deﬁning eﬀective and workable D2D communication protocols in our system to enhance mobile access of online social networks under disrupted network scenarios . 5 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION As a holistic mobile solution to enhance opportunistic networking and context - aware access to social media content , our system has been evaluated with extensive experiments both on realistic tests and trace analysis . 5 . 1 Mobile Client Application We have implemented an Android mobile app prototype for diﬀerent scenarios with intermittent cellular service . The DeepOpp app , as shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) , is designed for an underground metro system that usually lacks cellular coverage . The MetrOpp app , as shown in Fig . 5 ( b ) , is designed for urban areas that usually face infrastructure ( mobile access ) overload . Both apps can support prefetching , caching , D2D transmission , and displaying of social media contents from social networks under intermittent connectivity availability . Speciﬁcally as shown in Fig . 5 , DeepOpp can obtain the metadata and download the ranked newsfeed content from Facebook , and then support displaying user’s posted statuses , links , photos , and videos . Users also can see the number of " likes " a post has gotten and individual comments on a post . The online social media content was prefetched and cached when there was a usable mobile signal and can be accessed by mobile users in oﬄine and there is no mobile signal available as indicated by the 0 bar signal indication for cellular service in Fig . 5 ( a ) . DeepOpp users can use the refresh icon to manually update displayed content to achieve oﬄine access to online social media . MetrOpp also can perform similar prefetching and cache of content from a social network , as shown in Fig . 5 ( b ) to provide users with a news - feed of live football match commentary downloaded from BBC Sport’s website . The prefetched stream of match commentary can be displayed to the user after losing cellular signal , and disseminated to other mobile users via WiFi Direct assisted D2D communication ( see the full bar signal indication for WiFi connection in Fig . 5 ( b ) ) . Our mobile apps also provide controls that the mobile user of a UE can manage . Fig . 5 ( c ) shows the UI presented to the user to change the system settings . In the general settings , the user can opt to enable the optimizer , download over 3G ( need data plan support ) , and choose content to download . Once the optimizer is selected , the user can control speciﬁc optimizer thresholds for power , storage , and data plan . The UI of " Content to Download " is also given in Fig . 5 ( d ) , and it allows users to select preferred kinds of media content to download . Considering text , image and video are the major three types of media contents presented in social networks , users are authorized in our mobile apps to change their Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 .

The mobile client applications . preference to select part or all the contents to be cached during mobile prefetching . Because video usually consumes much more computing and communication resources than text and image in the process of mobile prefetching , these content options provide a friendly control interaction for the users , besides optimization settings , to balance their anticipated online social network experience against the UE’s real - time status ( e . g . battery , storage , residual data plan ) . We have tested DeepOpp on the London Underground ( simply the Underground ) which consists of 11 diﬀerent train lines and 403km of tracks covering the Greater London ; seven of these lines are considered deep - level that have no cellular signal , and the remaining four are sub - surface that have intermittent cellular service . We also tested MetrOpp in the area of Oxford Street , which is a major road located in the West End of London and considered Europe’s busiest shopping street , with around half a million daily visitors that usually generate overloaded infrastructure access and result in poor cellular service . We present these evaluations in following sections . 5 . 2 Evaluation of Mobile Prefetching The performance of mobile prefetching has been evaluated by real world experiments using the DeepOpp app on the London Underground . A total of about eleven hours worth of data was collected at various times by 20 crowd workers riding on the Circle Line route between South Kensington and King’s Cross stations . The signiﬁcant amount of time spent traveling on the Underground gives us conﬁdence in our results and means that we can break down readings by time of day . Each trial consists of a round - trip . Four morning trials were conducted during rush hour and two trials were conducted during the evening rush hour . During these trials , the train carriages ranged from busy to very packed and near capacity . Another two trials were carried out during the afternoon when the train carriages were generally quite empty with seats available . The mobile signal data collected earlier at speciﬁc time window could be used as the crowdsensed results for future prediction and optimization .

From Intermittent to Ubiquitous : Enhancing Mobile Access to Online Social Networks with . . . • 114 : 23 We ﬁrst test the crowdsensing performance of the 20 workers in a real - time scenario during the eleven hours for on - demand signal search . The values of mobile signal strength ( ASU values ) at diﬀerent underground locations are chosen as the items to answer by these workers . Assuming each worker answers (cid:2) items ( we refer (cid:2) as the budget ) , including k control items ( ASU values are known ) and (cid:2) − k target items ( ASU values are unknown ) . For each experiment , we ﬁrst construct several sets of target and control items by randomly partitioning items , then we randomly assign each worker to k control items and (cid:2) − k target items , for varying values of (cid:2) and k . 1 2 3 5 8 13 22 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 (cid:2) = 7 k ( # of control items ) M S E (cid:2) = 10 (cid:2) = 15 (cid:2) = 25 10 20 30 40 0 2 4 6 Budget (cid:2) O p t i m a l k (cid:40)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:79) (cid:3) (cid:50)(cid:83)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3) 100 200 300 400 500 600 2 4 6 n t ( # of target items ) O p t i m a l k (cid:40)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:79) (cid:3) (cid:50)(cid:83)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3) ( a ) MSE of signal strength ( b ) Optimal k vs .

Fig . 6 ( a ) shows the signal strength MSE ( mean squared error ) of the joint estimator with varying k . The stars and circles denote the empirically and theoretically optimal k , respectively . Fig . 6 ( b ) shows the optimal k as the budget (cid:2) varies . In the both ﬁgures , we have ﬁxed n t = 200 ; n t is the total number of target items . n t is large because we want to probe signal at more locations along the Underground lines , and the signal availability status at each location varies . Fig . 6 ( c ) shows the optimal k with varying n t , but ﬁxed (cid:2) = 50 . According to our proof in Section 2 . 3 , the optimal ( minimum ) number of control items ( k ) to minimize the expected MSE should scale as O ( (cid:2) / √ n t ) when using joint estimators . Fig . 6 shows our prediction of the optimal k matches the empirical results surprisingly well on the real dataset . Therefore , choosing a number of control items near the optimal k value could guarantee the performance of crowd reliability analysis for the aggregation of answers , meanwhile presenting an opportunity for each worker to answer more target items ( collect more mobile signal data ) along an underground traveling route . We next evaluate DeepOpp on mobile access performance and compare it with other state - of - the - art schemes . The access scheduler deﬁnes the process for how often and under which conditions the UE will fetch and obtain new data to store in the cache . Basic schedulers such as O2SM [ 48 ] runs on a ﬁxed interval and will make a fetch at this interval . A one - dimensional scheduler such as EarlyBird [ 37 ] runs on a ﬁxed interval schedule and will make a fetch if the current signal strength is above a set threshold . DeepOpp employs a diﬀerent kind of scheduler that uses the spatiotemporal signal availability crowdsensed by workers to reschedule fetches only at locations that we know have usable signal strength ; it can determine the current location and estimate future movements to reschedule at the next location that has a signal higher than a given threshold . Note that when there is no GPS signal on the Underground , DeepOpp can use the unique MAC address of station WiFi and corresponding WiFi - to - station mapping to localize mobile user .

Performance evaluation of scheduler in mobile access . Fig . 7 ( a ) shows the average percentage of successful requests and its standard deviation . From our experiments on the same section of the Circle Line , the number of requests was signiﬁcantly more for O2SM and EarlyBird than DeepOpp ( O2SM provided over 30 times as many success full retrievals of metadata ) . While O2SM and EarlyBird made many more requests , a larger proportion of their requests failed as reported by network errors from the social networks , due to the fact that the basic scheduler and one - dimensional scheduler have no knowledge of intermittent cellular service on the Underground . Therefore , while DeepOpp with crowdsensed information had an average success rate at 50 % , O2SM and EarlyBird only had the rate around 25 . 63 % and 36 . 27 % , respectively . The amount of power consumed per successful request is displayed in Fig . 7 ( b ) shows that the DeepOpp needed 2 . 58 times less power for each successful data request than O2SM . This is due to the power wasted by O2SM on failed attempts at making requests . The signiﬁcant number of requests made by EarlyBird also consumed much more power than DeepOpp . DeepOpp is based on a combination of cellular direct transmission and additional crowdsensed data gathered as part of its optimization for prefetching , therefore it consumed much less power than O2SM and EarlyBird . Fig . 7 ( c ) shows the total amount of power used by each application divided by the number of media items prefetched . DeepOpp was 2 . 51 times more eﬃcient at getting media items successfully than O2SM . This is similar to results in Fig . 7 ( b ) as most news - feed items from social network contains some media Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 .

In our trials , each metadata request contained ten feed items , which is why the power for each media item is approximately a tenth of that for each metadata request . As for data download eﬃciency compared to the power used by each of the three schedulers . Fig . 7 ( d ) shows the total power used divided by the total bytes downloaded over the course of the experiment . DeepOpp is more eﬃcient for the amount of data than other applications . O2SM with its ﬁxed - interval scheduler may begin downloading at points with little signal strength but fail due to the low signal strength at that location . Each time this happens the data downloaded is wasted , but it still contributes to a user’s data allowance and consumes power . The overheads in making these failed requests cause higher power usage . Each of the metrics in Fig . 7 shows that DeepOpp oﬀers a signiﬁcant improvement over existing solutions . O2SM and EarlyBird are much more likely to waste data and power on failed requests on the Underground than DeepOpp we have designed and implemented .

Performance evaluation of optimization solution . The 0 - 1 MKP presented in our paper is a classic NP - hard optimization problem and as such has several well - studied solution methods . To evaluate the performance of our system on solving the problem of prefetching and caching , especially the memory cost , we compared DeepOpp with a dynamic program - ming ( DP ) solution [ 29 ] , another classical solution method for the 0 - 1 MKP . Fig . 8 compares our branch and bound solution with heuristic design adopted in DeepOpp with the dynamic programming solution . The average performance and its standard deviation presented in Fig . 8 ( a ) and ( b ) show that DeepOpp can save remarkably 94 % on memory consumption and 59 % of power consumption in comparison with DP . The classical DP approach may be easily adapted to a problem where two " weight " budgets are used as memory and energy costs in our case , however memory is byte addressable and residual energy is probed at millijoule accuracy in Android , which means the memory and energy budgets will be represented by very large numbers , making a direct application of DP technique impractical . DeepOpp employs a metadata based heuristic to order and collect news item for running branch and bound approach , therefore can solve 0 - 1 MKP with less memory and energy cost , but no loss of accuracy . 5 . 3 Evaluation of D2D Communication The performance of D2D communication underlaying cellular networks is ﬁrst evaluated using our MetrOpp app in Oxford Street . We choose an area of Oxford Street with a radius of 100 meters for our Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 .

Due to the mobility of helpers , a helper could use the D2D connected transmission to forward the social content to subscribers or other help if it is away from the core area of Oxford Street ; cellular service is still available in the boundary zone . Otherwise , the helper employs mobile prefetching , and D2D opportunistic transmission where epidemic routing is used . The tests have 10 runs ; each run with a period around 5 minutes .

Performance evaluation of MetrOpp in D2D transmission . The MetrOpp is designed to provide news - feed of football matches . The results and actions of a match are highly time sensitive since fans want to stay as up to date as possible as new commentary is coming in every minute . Therefore , two performance metrics , percentage of data delivered and latency for delivered data , are evaluated for the dissemination of live match documentary in D2D scenario , as shown in Fig . 9 ( a ) and ( b ) respectively . When the number of UEs increases from 5 to 20 , we can correspondingly obtain average results with higher data delivery ratio and lower delivery latency , because the increase of helper density in a ﬁxed area means more contact opportunities for the D2D transmissions . We also observe that the D2D link established by WiFi Direct in MetrOpp could be impacted by random movement of visitors in Oxford Street , therefore presenting the performance deviations in both ﬁgures . However , the overall performance is still tolerable for accessing match commentary when there are more than 10 helpers involved in area with intermittent cellular service . To further evaluate our D2D framework underlaying cellular networks and the impacts of selﬁshness within the framework , we have to test a larger scale scenario . Considering our limit in testing time and manpower , the Cambridge trace [ 19 ] is adopted to meet the evaluation need . We use the method of [ 9 ] to compute the individual contact rates of node pairs by average statistics from the trace . We then average the contact rates of users to implement simulations . In each simulation scenario , there are 35 realistic human mobility traces . The total bandwidth is 20 MHz , and 80 % of the cellular resources are allocated to BS for transmitting data to UEs , and the other 20 % are used for D2D communications between UEs . We represent the two types of individual selﬁshness by two probabilities , individually connected selﬁshness probability ( ICSP ) and individual opportunistic selﬁshness probability ( IOSP ) , which reﬂect helpers’ unwillingness to cooperate in the two D2D modes , respectively . For example , if the ICSP is described by c ( 0 ≤ c ≤ 1 ) , then c is the probability of a helper’s refusal to cooperate with a UE within its D2D communication range in D2D connected communication .

The result shows that a slight decrease in IOSP leads to a large increase in the data transmission rate , while ICSP has less inﬂuence on the system performance . Its explanation is as follows : a helper with popular contents in its storage may transmit them during every D2D contact and , consequently , it can take advantage of the physical proximity more eﬃciently . By contrast , D2D connected transmission participants have to rely on the data ﬂow sent by the BS and the same contents may be downloaded frequently . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 400 500 600 700 800 900 Individual Connected Selfishness T o t a l D a t a T r an s m i ss i on R a t e ( M bp s ) Incremental Opportunistic Selfishness 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 400 500 600 700 800 900 Individual Opportunistic Selfishness T o t a l D a t a T r an s m i ss i on R a t e ( M bp s ) Incremental Connected Selfishness ( a ) Individual connected selﬁshness ( b ) Individual opportunistic selﬁshness Fig . 11 . Interaction between individual selﬁshness modes . Intuitively , when ICSP is relatively low , the unoccupied cellular resources as the result of users’ refusal to participate in D2D opportunistic transmission can be redistributed to D2D connected communications . We present the total data transmission rates under diﬀerent selﬁshness metrics in Fig . 11 , where there are 20 lines in both ﬁgures , with IOSP ranging from 0 to 0 . 95 with a step of 0 . 05 in Fig . 11 ( a ) , while ICSP Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 .

Further denote the total data transmission rate as d = f ( c , o ) , and its partial derivatives with respect to c and o as p and q , respectively . We have p ( c , o ) = ∂ f ∂ c ( c , o ) < 0 and q ( c , o ) = ∂ f ∂ c ( c , o ) < 0 . Both p and q are approximately monotonically decreasing functions of c and o , deﬁned on the interval [ 0 , 1 ] . Thus an increase of ICSP or IOSP by a given increment in IOSP or IOSP results in an obvious drop in the total data transmission rate . Therefore , if users are able to refuse D2D communication requests freely , the D2D communication system is likely to perform poorly due to high D2D opportunistic selﬁshness . Fortunately , there are possible solutions to this problem . If D2D connected transmission is compulsory in the protocol , the results will regress to the highest ( blue ) curve in Fig . 11 ( b ) , which shows that the dropped data transmission rate can be regained to some extend from around 600 Mbps to around 700 Mbps at high IOSP . By ensuring alternative D2D connected communication choices in the case of high rejection of D2D opportunistic transmission , it makes the D2D communication underlaying cellular network resilient to high D2D opportunistic selﬁshness and avoids forcing users to devote their storage to D2D . Another possible solution is to set a minimum D2D - request - acceptance ratio and a reasonable buﬀer reservation , which constrains the system to the top left ( the crimson part ) of Fig . 10 , and therefore guarantees satisfying performance . 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 Buffer Unselfishness Upper−Bound ( Mb ) Rate Unselfishness Factor T o t a l D a t a T r an s m i ss i on R a t e ( M bp s ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 10 100 200 300 400 500 600 Buffer Unselfishness Upper−Bound ( Mb ) Rate Unselfishness Factor D 2 D D a t a T r an s m i ss i on R a t e ( M bp s ) ( a ) Total data transmission rate ( b ) D2D data transmission rate Fig . 12 . Rate and buffer limits in individual selﬁshness . Apart from the above - mentioned ICSP and IOSP , individual selﬁshness also manifests in terms of power and buﬀer limits oﬀered to D2D transmission . To quantitatively reveal the impacts of these two kinds of user selﬁshness , we use two parameters , rate unselﬁshness factor ( RUSF ) and buﬀer unselﬁshness upper - bound ( BUSU ) , to measure how willing users to contribute power and storage for D2D communications . Speciﬁcally , RUSF is the ratio of the allowed D2D communication rate to the maximum available rate , which aﬀects both D2D communication modes , while BUSU is the upper - bound of the allocated buﬀer by helpers , which only constrains D2D opportunistic transmission . Therefore , we can set p i , j = 0 and q i , j = 0 , and instead , use the RUSF and BUSU to represent the constraints imposed by the individual selﬁshness . After performing the Cambridge trace - driven simulation study under the same practical network settings , we acquire the empirical results of the total data and total D2D data received per second , depicted in Fig . 12 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , as the functions of RUSF and BUSU .

From Intermittent to Ubiquitous : Enhancing Mobile Access to Online Social Networks with . . . • 114 : 29 From Fig . 12 , it can be seen that as the RUSF decreases , the achievable system rate reduces signiﬁcantly . Obviously , reducing power or uploading rate limit , which is a form of user selﬁshness , can severely decrease the data transmitted via D2D communications . On the other hand , enlarging the buﬀer size also brings signiﬁcant performance improvements when the buﬀer is small but has little impact when it is already suﬃciently large , i . e . the system performance shows a tendency of saturation with the increase of the buﬀer size . More speciﬁcally , for the simulated system , an increase in the buﬀer size of helpers has little inﬂuence on the achievable system performance when it is larger than 70 Mb . Therefore , the results of Fig . 12 suggest that to fully develop the potential of D2D underlaying cellular networks , service providers should discourage users to set the uploading rate limit for D2D communications . 5 . 4 User Feedbacks and Potential Limitations Discussions were held with some of the test users of DeepOpp and MetrOpp applications . The main users said that they enabled the application on about 70 - 80 % of their time under intermittent and disrupted networks . All found the operation process intuitive and straightforward . Testers were able to understand the purpose of the applications , understood that their cached social media data from mobile prefetching will be shared with other mobile users with similar social interests , and agreed with the D2D mode to serve as the helper to store , carry and forward data during D2D transmission so that they also can enjoy the same service in return when there is no cellular service in surrounding environments . Users are then able to obtain accurate estimations of cellular signal strength crowdsensed by reliable workers to run eﬀective mobile prefetching was well received by mobile users and likely contributed to more usage . Two - thirds ( nearly 70 % ) of the users in our study were satisﬁed with their experience and feel that our applications built around mobile crowdsensing , smart caching and agile D2D communication are important and useful . Other users were not satisﬁed with our applications mainly because of two reasons : 1 ) Extra power expenditure caused by redundant runs of mobile prefetching when the cached social media content is already up - to - date . 2 ) Running out of interesting social media items to browse when the UE is in an out of cache situation . However , the ﬁrst issue can’t be totally avoided since the mobile prefetching should attempt to update social media content under direct cellular coverage by its default schedule setting . It could be improved by adjusting the scheduled period per the request of user . The second issue can be addressed by adjusting system parameters speciﬁed by the user . For example , the user can choose the content to download and set the storage threshold , as shown in Fig . 5 ( c ) . When prompted further , users additionally stated that they would have preferred if news items which have been interacted with disappeared from the cached feed . However , this is not a feature found on many social media sites , including Facebook according to our knowledge . We noticed that the latency of delivered data for D2D communication , as shown in Fig . 9 ( b ) , was about 40 - 50 seconds when there were 10 UEs including helpers and subscribers . Though the latency seems long , our test was performed in the area of Oxford Street with around half a million daily visitors ; it is understood by our users that given limited number of helpers it is hard to establish either D2D connected transmission or D2D opportunistic transmission , and weak connectivity under this situation could be easily disturbed by other crowded people . However , the latency was greatly decreased to be around 10 seconds when there were 20 helpers , which presents a feasible number of helpers to be gathered given the high population density , as a result most of our users were satisﬁed . A user may choose to proceed to a Wi - Fi spot in the area of Oxford Street for faster access to social networks . However , as we have experienced , most of the open or free urban Wi - Fi spots are not user - friendly . To access this urban Wi - Fi , mobile users need to ﬁrst go through a registration process and share some of their private Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive , Mobile , Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies , Vol . 1 , No . 3 , Article 114 . Publication date : September 2017 . 114 : 30 • D . Wu et al . information such as name , email and phone number , etc . These are also sensitive information for personal social network account , therefore mobile users usually hesitate to use urban Wi - Fi spot to access social networks . Surprisingly , delay time for mobile prefetching was not a major problem for our users , as caching was activated automatically ; once mobile prefetching is ﬁnished users can browse the cached social media content immediately or at any time . Lengthy caching intervals happened naturally during the daily routes of our users and neither the delays nor the broken transmissions were noticed in most cases . Without user intervention ( though the option for manual caching exists in the app ) users were not discomforted during lengthy caching intervals . We also noticed the average successful request ratio of mobile prefetching on the Underground is around 50 % , which might be not a good result for over - ground scenario . However , this performance is acceptable by our users after they knew that it was mainly impacted by the fast train running on the Underground environment that barely has usable cellular service , especially for deep lines . For mobile users in the harsh situation , getting eﬀective social media content is more important than successful request ratio , therefore they can tolerate a little extra latency caused by lost requests and usually have the patience to wait while spending time to take a train on the Underground . Because the environmental interference can’t be avoided and our solution has already shown better performance than other state - of - the - art works , the average successful request ratio on the Underground is still satisﬁed from our test users’ point of view . At its current stage , our system does not handle network disconnection and connection interruptions very gracefully . Pieces of social media content that are not fully loaded by the time the wireless connection is broken are lost and need to be downloaded at the next wireless communication area . Solving this issue would be especially useful for unstable peer to peer connections occurring between devices in a crowded environment . Another limitation that we encounter is that users may not be good judges of how many resources to dedicate to caching ; they can get " buyer’s remorse " after consuming the resources they intended to expand on the application . In addition , as devices are increasingly organized as a social community , there is a requirement on cooperative communication among devices , for example using game theory approaches , to leverage diﬀerent status of devices and their available resources to share and forward social media content . Other limitations of current work include the need of better incentive scheme during crowdsensing , smarter spatial - temporal decision for mobile prefetching , robust maintenance of user privacy during D2D communication , etc . These will be studied in our future works . 6 CONCLUSIONS In this paper , we presented the design of a context - aware mobile system to enable eﬃcient oﬄine access to online social network in situations where intermittent signal coverage is experienced . The presented system design takes advantage of crowdsensed signal variation at diﬀerent locations to prefetch and cache data . It also supports D2D communication underlaying cellular networks with a framework to analyze the impact of user selﬁshness in the process . Opportunistic optimization schemes have been proposed to enhance the mobile crowdsensing , prefetching and D2D transmission , and presented a signiﬁcant improvement over existing approaches . In general , the system to the best of our knowledge is the ﬁrst work to integrate mobile prefetching and D2D communication as a holistic system to tackle various communication connections ; it is not only designed to optimize mobile access of online social networks but also extended to handle mobile connectivity issues for both intermittent and disrupted scenarios . In the future , we will further study user feedback and address potential limitation to improve the performance and usability of the current system .
