Tsagarakis , MD , PhD ∗ , Anthi Sideri , MD , Panagiotis Makridis , MD , Argyro Triantafyllou , MD , Alexandra Stamoulakatou , MD , PhD , Eleni Papadogeorgaki , MD , PhD Abstract The FilmArray Respiratory Panel ( FA - RP ) is an FDA certi ﬁ ed multiplex PCR that can detect 17 viruses and 3 bacteria responsible for upper respiratory tract infections , thus it is potentially useful to the assessment of the age - related prevalence of these pathogens . In this observational study , we retrospectively analyzed the results of all the respiratory samples , which had been processed during 1 year - period ( November 2015 to November 2016 ) with the FA - RP , in the Central Laboratories of Hygeia & Mitera General Hospitals of Athens , Greece . In order to have an age - related distribution , the following age groups were implemented : ( < 2 ) , ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) , ( ≥ 5 , < 10 ) , ( ≥ 10 , < 18 ) , ( ≥ 18 , < 45 ) , ( ≥ 45 , < 65 ) , and ( ≥ 65 ) years old . Among 656 respiratory samples tested , 362 ( 55 % ) were from male and 294 ( 45 % ) from female patients , while 356 ( 54 . 3 % ) were positive and 300 ( 45 . 7 % ) negative . In the ﬁ rst age - group ( < 2 ) , 41 / 121 samples ( 33 . 9 % ) revealed human rhinovirus / enterovirus ( HRV ) and 16 ( 13 . 2 % ) adenovirus ( Adv ) , followed by respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , coronavirus , human metapneumovirus ( Hmpv ) , and parain ﬂ uenza viruses ( PIV ) . In the age - group ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) , Adv predominated with 37 / 147 samples ( 25 . 2 % ) , followed by HRV , RSV , coronavirus ( all types ) , and in ﬂ uenza , Hmpv and PIV . In the age - group ( ≥ 5 , < 10 ) , HRV was identi ﬁ ed in 25 / 80 samples ( 31 . 3 % ) , Adv in 18 ( 22 . 5 % ) , in ﬂ uenza in 11 ( 13 . 8 % ) , and Hmpv in 6 ( 7 . 5 % ) . In ﬂ uenza predominated in the age - group ( ≥ 10 , < 18 ) , with 4 / 22 samples ( 18 . 2 % ) , while in the remaining age - groups ( ≥ 18 ) , HRV was the commonest isolated pathogen , 33 / 286 ( 11 . 5 % ) , followed by in ﬂ uenza with 20 ( 7 % ) ( in ﬂ uenza A H1 - 2009 , 11 / 20 ) . In our patient series , HRV seemed to prevail in most age - groups , followed by Adv , although In ﬂ uenza was the second most frequent pathogen isolated in the age - groups ( ≥ 18 ) . Moreover , increasing age corresponded to increasing possibility of having a negative sample , indicating that FilmArray may be more useful before adolescence .

Introduction Upper respiratory tract infections ( URIs ) can be a serious burden to the healthcare system . [ 1 ] The majority of URIs are of viral etiology , but de ﬁ nitive diagnosis can be dif ﬁ cult due to the overlapping clinical presentations of viral and bacterial infec - tions , and the variable sensitivity , and lengthy turn - around time of viral culture . [ 1 ] The rapid and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses is essential for the early diagnosis and administration of appropriate antiviral therapy , as well as for the effective implementation of infection control measures . [ 2 ] The FilmArray Respiratory Panel ( FA - RP ) assay is a fully automated , multiplex PCR system , which integrates nucleic acid extraction , nested ampli ﬁ cation and detection in a reaction pouch preloaded with all reagents required for detection of 17 viruses and 3 bacteria . [ 3 ] It does not require advanced equipment or expertise in molecular diagnostics , making it a useful point - of - care test for acute respiratory infections , [ 3 ] and a valuable tool for the assessment of the age - related prevalence of the responsible pathogens . 2 . Methods In order to investigate the age - related prevalence of each respiratory pathogen , we retrospectively studied the results of all the samples , which had been processed during 1 year - period ( November 2015 to November 2016 ) with the FA - RP , in the Central Laboratories of Hygeia & Mitera General Hospitals of Athens , Greece . Among 656 respiratory samples ( Rs ) tested , 362 ( 55 % ) were from male and 294 ( 45 % ) from female patients , while the median age of these 656 patients was 7 years old ( 0 . 1 – 92 ) . In order to have an age - related distribution , the following age groups were implemented : ( < 2 ) , ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) , ( ≥ 5 , < 10 ) , ( ≥ 10 , Editor : Leyi Wang .

Ethical approval and / or patient consent were not necessary , because the paper does not report on primary research and all data analyzed were retrospectively collected as part of routine diagnosis . 2 . 1 . BioFire FA - RP Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients with symptomatic respiratory tract infection and processed with FA - RP . [ 4 ] The assay detects nucleic acids of 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacteria , including adenovirus ( Adv ) , coronaviruses ( HCoV : OC43 , NL63 , 229E and HKU1 ) , human respiratory syncytial virus ( HRSV or RSV ) , human metapneumovirus ( Hmpv ) , in ﬂ uenza A virus ( H1 / 2009 , H1 and H3 ) , in ﬂ uenza B virus , parain ﬂ uenza viruses ( PIV , including PIV - 1 to PIV - 4 ) , human rhinovirus / enterovirus ( HRV ) , Bordetella pertussis , Chlamydophila pneumoniae , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in a multiplex PCR . [ 4 ] The extraction , ampli ﬁ cation , and detection steps take place in separate chambers of a self - contained , single - use pouch . The procedures were performed according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . 2 . 2 . Statistical analysis Chi - square tests and SPSS Statistics 17 . 0 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) were used for statistical analysis , while P < . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Spectrum of respiratory pathogens detected Among 656 respiratory samples tested , 356 / 656 ( 54 . 3 % ) were positive and 300 / 656 ( 45 . 7 % ) were negative . The total number of pathogens detected was larger than the positive samples , due to the frequent multiple isolations . Thus , 420 pathogens were detected , with HRV , Adv and in ﬂ uenza viruses ( A and B ) being the most usual isolated pathogens ( Table 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Age - related distribution of respiratory pathogens In the ﬁ rst age - group ( < 2 ) , 41 out of 121 samples ( 33 . 9 % ) revealed HRV , 16 / 121 ( 13 . 2 % ) Adv , 10 / 121 ( 8 . 3 % ) RSV , 10 / 121 ( 8 . 3 % ) coronavirus ( 229E , NL63 , OC43 , and HKU1 ) , 9 ( 7 . 4 % ) Hmpv , and 9 ( 7 . 4 % ) PIV ( 1 , 2 , and 3 ) . In the age - group ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) , Adv predominated with 37 out of 147 samples ( 25 . 2 % ) , followed by HRV ( 29 / 147 , 19 . 7 % ) , RSV ( 16 / 147 , 16 . 9 % ) , coronavirus ( all types ) , and in ﬂ uenza ( A and B ) , ( 14 / 147 , 9 . 5 % ) each , Hmpv ( 12 / 147 , 8 . 2 % ) and PIV ( 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , 9 ( 6 . 1 % ) . In the age - group ( ≥ 5 , < 10 ) , HRV was identi ﬁ ed in 25 / 80 samples ( 31 . 3 % ) , Adv in 18 / 80 ( 22 . 5 % ) , in ﬂ uenza ( A and B ) in 11 ( 13 . 8 % ) , and Hmpv in 6 / 80 ( 7 . 5 % ) . In ﬂ uenza predominated in the age - group ( ≥ 10 , < 18 ) , with 4 / 22 samples ( 18 . 2 % ) , while in the remaining 3 age - groups ( ≥ 18 ) , HRV was the commonest isolated pathogen 33 / 286 ( 11 . 5 % ) , followed by In ﬂ uenza with 20 / 286 ( 7 % ) ( in ﬂ uenza A H1 - 2009 , 11 / 20 ) . The frequency of each pathogen in each respective age - group has been displayed in Figure 1 . There was a statistically signi ﬁ cant difference between all age groups , for HRV ( P < . 001 ) , Adv ( P < . 001 ) , in ﬂ uenza ( ALL ) ( P = . 02 ) , RSV ( P = . 002 ) , PIV - 3 ( P = . 04 ) , and coronavirus ( ALL ) ( P = . 02 ) . Based on Figure 1 , it is obvious that HRV prevailed in all age groups , but especially in the groups ( < 2 ) and ( ≥ 5 , < 10 ) . Among Adv positive samples , there was a signi ﬁ cant difference between the age group ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) ( most cases , 37 / 83 or 44 . 6 % ) and ( ≥ 45 , < 65 ) ( no case ) ( P = . 001 ) , while most of the RSV positive samples ( 26 / 36 , 72 . 2 % ) were noticed in ages under 5 years old . In regard with samples positive for in ﬂ uenza ( A or B ) , the predominance of in ﬂ uenza in the age group ( ≥ 10 , < 18 ) was due to in ﬂ uenza B cases , while the majority of cases with in ﬂ uenza A H1 - 2009 were noticed in the ages under 10 years old ( 16 / 27 , 59 . 3 % ) . The latter was also true for Hmpv ( 27 / 39 , 69 . 2 % ) , while PIV - 3 , the main PIV type detected ( Table 1 ) had a peak incidence in ages under 5 years old ( 15 / 19 , 78 . 9 % ) . Finally , most cases of coronavirus ( all types included ) were detected in children < 10 years old ( 28 out of 35 cases , 80 % ) , 10 of which ( 28 . 6 % ) were in children ( < 2 ) , with 2 types of coronavirus being detected in a single sample . 3 . 3 . Multiple detections Among the total Rs , 57 / 656 ( 8 . 7 % ) revealed multiple isolations . Based on positive samples only , we had multiple pathogens in 57 out of 356 positive Rs . HRV participated in most multiple isolations , being the most frequent isolated pathogen ( 37 / 57 , 64 . 9 % ) ( Fig . 2 ) . The second more frequently observed pathogens were PIV ( 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , identi ﬁ ed in 24 out of 57 samples ( 42 . 1 % ) , and Adv identi ﬁ ed in 23 out of 57 samples ( 40 . 4 % ) , followed by RSV ( 15 / 57 , 26 . 3 % ) ( Fig . 2 ) . It is remarkable that the combination HRV / Adv was the most commonly observed , with 10 cases out of 57 ( 17 . 5 % ) , followed by HRV / RSV combination ( 6 / 57 , 10 . 5 % ) ( Table 2 ) . Regarding the age - related distribution of multiple respiratorypathogens , itshouldbenotedthatmostofthem ( 41 / 57 , 71 . 9 % ) concerned ages under 5 years old , while the combination HRV / Adv was mainly observed in the age group 2 to 10 ( Table 2 ) . 3 . 4 . Negative samples It was also remarkable that negative samples were mostly encountered in older ages . In particular , in the age group ( < 2 ) , 33 Table 1 The spectrum of pathogens detected by the FA - RP , irrespective of single or multiple identi ﬁ cations .

Discussion Respiratory infections are a common cause of pediatric morbidity [ 5 ] and the vast majority of acute URIs are caused by viruses . [ 6 ] Molecular point - of - care testing for respiratory viruses has the potential to improve the detection rate of respiratory viruses , improve the use of in ﬂ uenza antivirals and reduce Figure 1 . The frequency ( % ) of each pathogen ’ s identi ﬁ cation , among the total of samples in each separate age - group . Figure 2 . The frequency ( % ) of each pathogen in multiple isolations .

[ 7 ] However , the age - related preva - lence of these identi ﬁ able upper respiratory pathogens has not been clearly established . In this study , the routine clinical application of the FA - RP was indirectly used as a molecular point - of - care testing for the age - strati ﬁ cation of the respiratory viruses detected , in a tertiary hospital of Greece . HRV was the most commonly identi ﬁ ed virus in almost all age groups , but especially in the groups ( < 2 ) and ( ≥ 5 , < 10 ) . The increasing availability of multiplex PCR panels allows rapid detection of HRV and provides the opportunity for timely treatment and early recognition of outbreaks . [ 8 ] The predomi - nance of HRV in our patient series is in accordance with previously published data . [ 9 – 13 ] including data with patients under the age of 2 . [ 14 ] HRV has been previously identi ﬁ ed as the most common pathogen detected among symptomatic young children in a pediatric emergency department , with the majority of them requiring hospitalization . [ 15 ] The same was true in our series , where all cases were symptomatic and most cases had been hospitalized . Based on our results , HRV should certainly be included in the differential diagnosis of URIs in older patients , too . In the case of Adv , our results indicate that the age group ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) seem to be at the highest risk of getting infected . Until now , Adv has been considered as 1 of the 5 most frequent respiratory Figure 3 . Negative samples were mostly encountered to older ages , with a peak incidence in the age group ( ≥ 45 , < 65 ) . Table 2 The age - related frequency of each respiratory combination pattern .

Medicine ( 2018 ) 97 : 22 Medicine 4 pathogens among children , [ 16 – 18 ] with infants being the popula - tion of the highest risk . In our study , Adv is referred for the ﬁ rst time as the most frequent responsible pathogen in the age group ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) and second in priority among all the identi ﬁ ed pathogens . These results may re ﬂ ect a trend of increasing total incidence and higher - age peak incidence for Adv positive cases . RSV is a regular winter visitor that is highly contagious among persons of all ages . [ 19 ] Although long recognized as the major viral pathogen of the lower respiratory tract of infants , it has also been implicated in severe lung disease in adults , especially the elderly . [ 20 , 21 ] This was not con ﬁ rmed in our study , where most RSV positive samples were noticed in ages under 5 years old . However , it should be noticed that 4 out of the 5 positive cases which occurred in the ages ≥ 18 ( data not shown ) , belonged to the age group ( ≥ 65 ) , highlighting the relevance of this virus in all ages . [ 22 ] As for samples positive for In ﬂ uenza ( A or B ) , we should underline the total prevalence of in ﬂ uenza A H1 - 2009 , the high incidence of in ﬂ uenza A H1 - 2009 in ages under 10 years old and the preference of in ﬂ uenza B incidence in the middle ages . In ﬂ uenza A and B are important causes of respiratory illness in all age groups . [ 23 ] In ﬂ uenza has been referred as the most common etiologic agent ( 55 . 7 % ) , especially among adults . [ 24 ] This was not true in our case , except for the age group ( ≥ 10 , < 18 ) . However , in ﬂ uenza A has been previously considered as 1 of the 3 most frequent pathogens in the community setting . [ 16 , 18 ] Our data indicate that this applies totally to ages over 5 years . Moreover , it has been proposed that the highest incidence of Hmpv infection is among children , as seropositivity for hMPV approaches 100 % by 5 to 10 years of age . [ 25 ] In our series , although 70 % of Hmpv positive cases were identi ﬁ ed in ages under 10 , we also had 12 cases after the age of 18 years old , underlying that a considerable number of Hmpv infections are diagnosed in adults and the elderly . [ 25 ] Finally , PIV are single - stranded RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family that may cause of URIs and lower respiratory infections in infants , children and immunocompro - mised individuals . [ 26 , 27 ] It is considered that almost 90 % of PIV - positive samples are from pediatric patients younger than 5 years old , with no infant under 1 month of age found positive . [ 26 ] These were true in our series , with PIV - 3 being the most representative type . Also , HCoV are considered important respiratory patho - gens , especially in hospitalized children under 2 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients . [ 28 ] Our data indicate that although 80 % of cases belonged to the age group < 10 years old , the peak incidence was met at the age group ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) . The available reference data on the frequency of respiratory co - infections vary , although most reported percentages are higher than our results . In a study of 315 respiratory samples from children under 6 years of age , the FA - RP identi ﬁ ed multiple co - infections ( 39 % ) with 2 , 3 , 4 , and up to 5 different viruses . [ 29 ] Co - infection has also been found in 31 % , [ 13 ] 36 % , [ 9 ] 37 % , [ 10 ] 42 % , [ 30 ] and 51 . 8 % [ 31 ] of positive respiratory samples . In our study , 9 % of all our respiratory patients had multiple pathogens and 16 % of all positive respiratory patients ( almost 1 of 6 positive samples appeared with co - detections ) . There is no obvious explanation about the signi ﬁ cance of lower frequency of co - detection in our series of patients . However , the predominance of HRV in our single and multiple detections is in accordance with previously published data . [ 32 ] Moreover , HRV / Adv and HRV / RSV combinations have been previously mentioned as the most frequent co - infection patterns . [ 30 , 33 ] Interestingly , it has been suggested that the presence of RSV reduces the probability of rhinovirus infection , but that , if a co - infection occurs , both viruses cause clinical symptoms . [ 34 ] Regarding the age - related distribution of multiple pathogens , our observation that patients under 5 years of age were more likely to have multiple detections , is almost in accordance with the eliminated previously published data . [ 33 , 35 – 37 ] Nevertheless , Tramuto et al have also noticed that most of their patients with multiple etiology were adults and elderly . [ 24 ] In conclusion , understanding the viral etiology and age - speci ﬁ c incidence of URIs can help identify risk groups and probably inform vaccine delivery . In this study , HRV predominated in almost all ages , Adv in the age group ( ≥ 2 , < 5 ) and In ﬂ uenza was second in the ages ( ≥ 18 ) . Finally , it was remarkable that the negative samples were mostly attributed to older ages , with a peak incidence in the age group ( ≥ 45 , < 65 ) , con ﬁ rming that , as the age of the patient increases , the positivity rate for the PCR decreases proportionately , [ 32 ] a ﬁ nding that needs further explanation .
