We propose an approach for studying the mechanisms at the levels of network topology , gene ontology , signaling pathways , and disease inference . We treated inflammatory mediators as toxic chemicals and retrieved the genes and interacting proteins associated with them via a set of biological medical databases and software . We identified > 10 , 000 genes associated with SCI . Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) had the highest scores , and the top 30 were adopted as core data . In the core interacting protein network , TNF and other top 10 nodes were the major hubs . The core members were involved in cellular responses and metabolic processes , as components of the extracellular space and regions , in protein - binding and receptor - binding functions , as well as in the tNF signaling pathway . In addition , both seizures and sCI were highly associated with tNF levels ; therefore , for achieving a better curative effect on SCI , TNF and other major hubs should be targeted together according to the theory of network intervention , rather than a single target such as TNF alone . Furthermore , certain drugs used to treat epilepsy could be used to treat sCI as adjuvants . Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) is followed by a complex cascade of inflammatory events , such as reactive astrocytosis , which upregulates many genes 1 , 2 and forms a glial scar 3 – 5 . This typically results in a permanent loss of neurolog - ical function below the injury level 3 , 4 . Considerable efforts have been made in research involving SCI - induced inflammatory cytokines , such as neurotoxic reactive astrocytes induced by secreting IL - 1 α , TNF , and C1q that leads to activation of microglia 2 , and those represent potential therapeutic targets 6 – 10 ; however , it is largely unclear how the genes associated with SCI ( GAS ) interact and which among them play key roles . We consider that a network - based integration and bioinformatic analyses of the data available for genes / proteins associated with disease will reveal possible mechanisms for assessing the effects of GAS on SCI , leading to greater clarity . As is known 11 , biochemical events driven by electrostatic forces and involving hydrophobic effects are the physical contacts with high specificity through which the gene or protein interaction network is established . In a network of biomolecules , the nodes ( vertices ) indicate genes or proteins , whereas the links ( edges ) indicate their physical ( direct ) or functional ( indirect ) interactions 12 . Network analysis has demonstrated an efficient approach for mod - eling biological systems 12 – 14 . For example , it could reveal the molecular mechanisms of cancer 13 – 17 and infer the diseases associated with environmental chemicals 18 , 19 . During the last decade , with the popularization of RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) technologies and the development of bioinformatics analyses , a wealth of data for con - structing a biomolecule network has been available from public databases / resources , such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM ) 20 , Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) 21 , Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes / Proteins ( STRING ) 22 , 23 , and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ) 24 – 26 . OMIM is an updated catalog of human genes and genetic disorders and traits based on selection and review of the published peer - reviewed biomedical literature and has become one of the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) 27 ; KEGG is a collection of databases with genomes , diseases , drugs , and chemicals , featuring the products of relevant pathways in biology ; STRING includes experimental data , compu - tational prediction methods and public text collections in biology , and links to numerous sources , and is able to generate known and predicted protein – protein interactions ( PPIs ) ; and CTD curates data on chemical – gene / protein interactions , chemical – disease and gene – disease relationships from selected literature sources in a struc - tured format , and controlled vocabularies and inference scores , and integrates these data with those from NCBI , OMIM , KEGG , and 8 other databases , and links all the interactions to the original publications to enable users to Shanghai Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics , Shanghai University , Shanghai , 200072 , P .

The inflammatory cytokines associ - ated with SCI are neurotoxins 2 , and the toxicogenomics approaches can be used to identify them . TNF was first discovered in 1968 as a cytotoxic factor induced by lymphocytes and was referred to as a lymphotoxin ( LT ) 28 ; therefore , it might be favorable for us to use the CTD database for collecting the SCI - gene data , and the CTD in - house scoring system for screening that data . There are thousands of curated genes associated with SCI in CTD that are available for the required bioinformatics analyses 26 , such as in this study about the effects of GAS on SCI . In an effort to assess the effects of GAS on SCI , we designed a network - based integration and bioinformatics analysis approach , incorporating the disease - gene toxicogenomics 26 , PPI networks 22 , 23 , and gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis 29 – 32 and disease inference 26 . First , GAS were retrieved from CTD . Subsequently , the protein interactions involved in GASs were integrated from STRING database 22 , 23 , and visualized via Cytoscape 33 – 35 , a popular , open source bioinformatics software platform for network analysis . Finally , by using the interacting proteins , the functions and pathways associated with SCI were inferred . As a result , the most important as well as the top 30 interacting proteins were singled out ; affected functions and pathways were identified ; and dis - eases , including neurological and psychological disorders , were predicted , which provided better insight into the influence of GAS on SCI and related diseases . This analysis approach is also expected to be useful for studying neurotrophic factors and nerve growth factors involved in SCI and its consequences . Using biological data in system - level to study disease - gene associations is able to improve our current knowledge of disease relationships , leading to further improvements in disease diagnosis , prognosis and treatment . Material and Methods Genes / proteins associated with sCI ( GAs ) . GAS data were obtained from CTD 26 by searching for genes involved in SCI , resulting in a list of 12 , 824 GAS or their protein products , which were then sorted by the CTD in - house “inference score” in descending order . The top 30 GAS ( GAS30 ) with high scores ( 47 . 84 - 33 . 7 ) were taken as the core data in this study ( i . e . , in this context , the GAS30 represented the genes that were most closely associated with SCI ) . Then , Cytoscape ( version3 . 4 . 0 , 2016 ) 34 and STRING ( version 10 . 5 ) 23 were conducted to query the pro - tein - protein interactions of the GAS30 . STRING is as an application ( App , plugin ) installed in Cytoscape . The data in STRING are weighted and integrated and a confidence score is calculated for all protein interactions according to the nature and quality of the supporting evidence . As a result , each of these interactions is assigned a confidence score between zero ( no interaction ) and one ( high - confidence interaction ) , which indicates the probability that the interaction is authentic , given the available evidence . The default cutoff for confidence interactions is 0 . 4 18 , 19 . This study utilized this default value to screen PPIs and only the interactions whose confidence scores were > 0 . 4 were considered for network analysis . Of the established PPI network of the GAS30 , all nodes were from CTD and with CTD in - house inference scores of > 33 , and all edges were from STRING and with STRING in - house confidence scores of > 0 . 4 . Furthermore , the plugin NetworkAnalyzer 34 in Cytoscape was used to visualize molecular interac - tion networks and integration with gene expression profiles and other state data . Enrichment analysis of gene ontology , pathway , and disease . Gene ontology ( GO ) 31 , 32 , a con - trolled vocabulary describing gene products and a useful resource for studying gene functions 36 , consists of three domains termed cellular components ( CC ) , molecular functions ( MFs ) , and biological processes ( BP ) . Identifying enriched GO terms from a given gene list enables insight into the over - represented functions of genes 29 . Enrichment analysis of pathways and diseases is also an approach to the further understanding of the implicated pathways and diseases associated with SCI . Several web services such as the BinGO 37 plugin of Cytoscape , OmicsBean 38 and Set Analyzer 26 of CTD can be employed for studying enriched GO terms , pathways and diseases , respectively . Among these services , the pathway - gene relationships for enrichment analysis are from the KEGG 21 and REACTOME 39 pathway databases , whereas the MEDIC disease vocabulary 24 that combines the Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) 40 and OMIM 20 databases is used for analysis of enriched diseases . Briefly , we input the gene list of GAS30 respectively into BinGO or OmicsBean for GO term analysis ; OmicsBean for path - ways analysis ; and the set analyzer of CTD for diseases analysis , while using a p - value of < 0 . 05 . Results ppI network analysis . A total of 12 , 824 genes were identified as associated with SCI using CTD as of December 12 , 2017 . Among these , the top 30 genes ( GAS30 ) with CTD inference scores > 33 are listed in Table 1 . After inputting the GAS30 gene list into Cytoscape , assigning a link to STRING , and assuming that the interac - tions between the molecules were nondirectional and with interacting confidence scores of > 0 . 4 in STRING , we obtained a PPI network for GAS30 . Figure 1A shows a GAS30 PPI network that consists of 30 nodes and 232 edges . A node represents a molecule and an edge represents an interaction between two connected nodes . These two nodes are called neighbors . The fact that no edge is connected to a node such as myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) indicates that interactions between this node and others do not exist ( at least their interacting confidence scores were ≤ 0 . 4 ) and it should be deleted from this network . The number of edges / neighbors related to a node is referred to as the degree of the node 35 , 41 , 42 . A node with a number of edges that greatly exceeds the average is referred to as hub and these play crucial roles in the network 43 . Therefore , molecules in the GAS30 network could be re - sorted by their node degrees . By use of NetworkAnalyzer 34 , a Cytoscape plugin for network topology anal - ysis , the degrees of each node in the GAS30 network were calculated and the top 10 are listed in Table 2 . Among these , the TNF node exhibited the greatest degree , and is termed a major hub . Furthermore , the top 10 interacting molecules become a sub - network of the GAS30 cohort , and are denoted as GAS10 and shown in Fig . 1B . The sub - network GAS10 comprised 10 nodes and 44 edges , leading to an extremely high clustering coefficient 41 of 0 . 978 and an extremely small diameter 44 of 2 . That is , the 10 nodes were all major hubs and highly interconnected . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2019 ) 9 : 928 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 37357 - 1 Gene Gene ID Inference Score 1 MAPK1 5594 47 . 84 2 IL6 3569 47 . 13 3 AGT 183 45 . 15 4 CASP3 836 45 . 06 5 MAPK3 5595 44 . 58 6 CCL2 6347 44 7 TGFB1 7040 43 . 61 8 ITGAM 3684 43 . 11 9 MMP3 4314 41 . 76 10 EDN1 1906 41 . 69 11 IL1B 3553 41 . 52 12 FOS 2353 40 . 79 13 TNF 7124 40 . 13 14 TIMP1 7076 39 . 27 15 CYBA 1535 39 16 APP 351 37 . 77 17 ICAM1 3383 37 . 76 18 NOS2 4843 37 . 71 19 NOS1 4842 36 . 44 20 MMP9 4318 36 . 37 21 MPO 4353 36 . 37 22 XBP1 7494 36 . 3 23 FN1 2335 36 . 23 24 IL4 3565 36 . 04 25 GSK3B 2932 35 . 3 26 PTGS2 5743 35 . 1 27 RELA 5970 35 . 05 28 STAT1 6772 34 . 23 29 SOD2 6648 34 . 15 30 THBS1 7057 33 . 7 Table 1 .

Specifically , the process of responding to lipopolysaccharide involved 57 % of GAS30 members ( Fig . 2 ) and was promoted to the highest GO level in a significant p - value ( Table 3 ) . Lipopolysaccharide is a cell wall component of gram - negative bacteria , and is a type of endotoxin 45 that is released only when bacterial cells are destroyed or when using an artificial method to kill the microorganisms . Considerable evidence has revealed the influence of lipopolysaccharides on central nervous system ( CNS ) diseases . For example , lipopolysaccharides can cause Figure 2 .

The enriched GO terms for CCs of the interacting proteins were mostly related to the extracellular space com - ponents , in which the first two ( i . e . , extracellular space and extracellular region components ) , exhibited the most significant p - values in CCs ( Table 3 ) and accounted for 50 % and 63 % of GAS30 members ( Fig . 2 ) , respectively . A hierarchical GO tree for CCs enriched in GAS30 is presented in Fig . 3 . The MFs influenced by the interacting GAS30 proteins were mostly related to the protein - binding and receptor - binding functions , according to the enriched GO terms . Notably , protein binding accounted for the highest percentage ( 93 % ) in GAS30 in all enriched GO terms as shown in Fig . 2 . Figure 4 shows a hierarchical tree of important GO terms for MFs affected by the interacting GAS30 proteins . Pathway enrichment analysis . To further reveal the pathways affected by interacting GAS30 proteins , analyses were performed using OmicsBean 38 , a web service for processing biological data and with links to KEGG 21 and other public databases . Following the instructions of OmicsBean , Table 4 and Fig . 5 were generated . The top 10 with the most significant p - values are listed in Table 4 and shown in Fig . 5 .

The diseases associated with TNF were inferred using the toxicogenomics analyses of CTD , which yielded 570 nervous system diseases associated with TNF . The top 30 diseases sorted by CTD in - house inference scores are listed in Table 5 . Notably , among these , seizures had the highest score ( No . 1 in Table 5 ) . Discussion We considered SCI - induced inflammatory mediators as a type of toxin that inhibits the regeneration of injured tissue / cells , and we identified the associated genes and interacting proteins from known biological medical data - bases , CTD 26 , STRING 23 , and others , and chose the top 30 genes / proteins , GAS30 , that were useful for studying their effects on SCI at the levels of network topology , GO , signaling pathways , and disease inference to provide a new visual angle for finding potential methods by which SCI intervenes . According to this study , more than 10 , 000 genes associated with SCI and TNF achieved the highest score . TNF , FOS , IL6 , and seven other of the top 10 nodes ( Table 2 ) were the major hubs and highly interconnected in the GAS30 PPI network that were identified using CTD , STRING , and related databases . From the perspective of network topology 48 , such a network allows for a fault - tolerant behavior for which , if a hub - failure occurs , the net - work will generally not lose its connectedness because of the remaining hubs that will rapidly replace the failing hub . This suggests that although TNF negatively affected SCI repair , all other major hubs , such as FOS IL6 , should be targeted simultaneously in the future for the development of new therapeutic approaches , rather than aiming at individual specific genes , one at a time , which might achieve better curative effects . Furthermore , GAS30 members interfered mainly with cellular responses and metabolic processes , extracel - lular space and extracellular region components , protein - binding and receptor - binding functions , and TNF sig - naling pathways as identified by GO and pathway enrichment analyses . Notably , the TNF signaling pathways were promoted to the highest enriched level of GAS30 members and had the most significant p - value ( Table 4 ) . Although considerable evidence has revealed the influence of TNF as an inducer of inflammatory cytokines after SCI 7 – 9 ( e . g . , neurotoxic reactive astrocytes induced by activation of microglia through secreting Il - 1 α , TNF , and C1q 2 ) , greater attention should be paid to TNF in the future and consider it to be a major signaling pathway and its use as a crucial and potential therapeutic target for SCI repair . In addition , seizures were highly associated with TNF by CTD disease inference ( Table 5 ) . Clinically , seizures might occur after traumatic brain injury , and interestingly , repeated seizures might develop into post - traumatic epilepsy 49 – 51 . Seizures were also observed following SCIs 52 , 53 . More interestingly , the antiepileptic drug valproate was used as a supplement in stem cell transplantation for a mouse model of SCI , which dramatically enhanced the restoration of hindlimb function 54 . These suggest that certain drugs used to treat epilepsy could be employed as adjuvants in SCI treatment ; however , these observations and suggestions were not directly linked to TNF by the original researchers , and the mechanisms proposed are unclear . Therefore , TNF , which is the most important hub identified in this study , could be further connected to the aforementioned findings and would be a direction for future SCI studies . There are other aspects of this study that must be mentioned . In addition to CTD , the genes / proteins associ - ated with SCI or other diseases that were searched to construct the PPI networks and subsequent bioinformatics analyses could be from OMIM 20 , 55 or other publicly available databases 56 , which would generate similar results because nearly all public databases are interconnected to the Internet ; therefore , the primary data mostly over - lap with each other . As such , CTD includes OMIM and 10 other databases 26 . We used CTD in this study for its full name ( Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ) as well as its functions that matched our requirements for treating inflammatory cytokines in SCI as a type of neurotoxin . In recent years , disease genome sequencing and other high - throughput studies of disease genomes have generated many notable discoveries 17 . Direct data on Figure 5 .

The horizontal axis indicates pathway names , whereas the vertical coordinates indicate the negative values of the log of the p - values : e . g . , the horizontal dashed - lines in red and in blue have p - values equal to 0 . 01 and 0 . 05 , respectively , and their vertical coordinates are equal to − log ( 0 . 01 ) = 2 and − log ( 0 . 05 ) = 1 . 3 , respectively . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 8 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2019 ) 9 : 928 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 37357 - 1 disease - genes are commonly derived from RNA - seq because it is superior to other high - throughput technologies , such as microarray in accuracy , dynamic range , and differential expression detection , and has nearly completely replaced microarray for conducting genetic tests . The entries curated in OMIM have referenced 57 – 60 the results from RNA - seq , and NCBI 27 online accepts RNA - seq data and shares it with other databases and researchers . In addition , the data in references 2 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 13 – 17 in this study were primarily from RNA - seq . Furthermore , a combi - nation 61 of using RNA - seq approach with PPI network analysis generated that TNF had the largest number of connected edges in the PPI network for contusive SCI in a mouse model , and the top ranked genes in the SCI gene list overlapped considerable with ours , supporting our current study ; however , our present method hardly describes the dynamic effects of GAS on SCI . On the other hand , notably , because of its pleiotropic role , TNF shows , for example , a positive effect on regulatory T cells 62 and prevents neurons from death / apoptosis by activat - ing NF - κ B 63 , 64 ; therefore , suppressing TNF overexpression might not be a desirable intervention for SCI therapy , and this needs to be observed further . Furthermore , to more effectively predict the SCI drug targets , the patient - specific signaling networks for reactive inflammation from SCI could be constructed using the concept of “SCI hallmarks” based on individual genomic data and on regulatory functions , just as the signaling networks of “cancer hallmarks” 13 – 17 have been developed and substantially used for revealing molecular mechanisms of cancers and drug targets . This proposed approach to anal - yses is also expected to be useful for studying neurotrophic factors and nerve growth factors after SCIs . With a constantly expanding repertoire of techniques , including RNA - seq , together with new information on genes and proteins , the current results will have more possibilities for examination and modification and will advance the current approaches to SCI analysis .
