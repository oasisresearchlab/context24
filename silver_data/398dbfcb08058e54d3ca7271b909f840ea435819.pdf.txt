Preface This volume presents protocols for advancing the utility of nanotechnology in cancer research toward improving our understanding of cancer biology , prevention , diagnosis , and therapy . There are continuously new discoveries in the ﬁeld of nanotechnology , thus creating new imaging systems or therapies . This volume does not aim at covering those expansive discoveries ; instead , it focuses on how to employ certain discoveries for studying cancer by presenting principles along with techniques to allow for the transformation of any new discoveries in the ﬁeld into cancer - studying tools . The audience for the ﬁeld of nanotechnology in cancer is diverse and includes physical scientists , engineers , and biomed - ical scientists . A major deﬁciency in the ﬁeld of cancer nanotechnology has been the limited involvement of biomedical scientists who can enhance the speed of discoveries toward cancer diagnosis and therapy . This volume of the Methods in Molecular Biology series in cancer nanotechnology may help focus the biomedical scientists on the potential in this ﬁeld and improve their understanding of the utility of this ﬁeld for conquering cancer . This volume also serves as a resource for physical scientists and engineers interested in employing nanotechnology in cancer diagnosis and therapy .

In addition , there are new nanotechnology - based platforms for diagnosis of cancers and for theranostics , i . e . , integrating diag - nosis with therapy and follow - up of effectiveness of therapy . This chapter presents an overview of these nanotechnology - based advancements in the areas of prevention , diagnosis , therapy , and theranostics for cancer . In addition , we stress the need to educate bio - and medical students in the ﬁeld of nanotechnology . Key words Nanocarriers , Cancer , Targeting , Drug delivery , Theranostics , Education 1 Introduction Nanotechnology has various applications in cancer including pre - vention , diagnosis , therapy , and the integration of diagnosis and therapy or theranostics . Various advancements in nanomaterials and design of nanocarriers or nano - based platforms have been tested for these applications . We present here an overview of these applications and we stress the need for partnership with biomedical scientists to focus on speciﬁc diseases in order to improve preven - tion , therapy , and theranostics of cancer . 2 Types of Nanocarriers and Nanomaterials The ﬁrst generation of nanocarriers included liposomes [ 1 , 2 ] and simple polymers [ 3 ] . Liposomes are made of phospholipids , which have a polar head and a hydrophobic tail that self - assemble to form spheres ranging in size from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers . Liposomes can be used to deliver hydrophilic or hydrophobic drugs [ 4 – 6 ] and they maybe functionalized with polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) to increase their half - life in circulation , Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 1 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 3 and such liposomes are referred to as stealth liposomes [ 4 , 7 ] . In general , nanocarriers that are used for drug delivery are usually functionalized by PEG with a molecular weight ( MW ) between 1 and 40 kDa [ 6 ] . This is a desirable coating for nanocarriers because it reduces their nonspeciﬁc interaction with serum proteins that tag them for internalization by cells within the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) . This reduces their immunogenicity and their non - speciﬁc uptake by cells within the RES , thus diminishing their phagocytosis and leading to prolonging the circulation time of nanocarriers [ 6 ] . In addition , functionalizing with PEG reduces toxicity and agglomeration of nanocarriers [ 8 ] . Simple polymers were also among the ﬁrst generation of drug nanocarriers , and initially they comprised natural polymers such as polysaccharides [ 9 ] and polypeptides [ 10 ] made of natural building blocks , sugars and amino acids respectively . Examples of such poly - mers include chitosan and albumin , in addition to polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid or a combination of both . These natural polymers are also used to deliver non - soluble drugs after chemically conjugating them to the polymer . This way they mimic albumin in the circulation which transfers non - soluble molecules in the aque - ous environment of the blood . Both liposomes and natural poly - mers have the advantages of being biocompatible and biodegradable . More complex polymers that have been used as drug nanocar - riers include micelles [ 11 ] which are made of self - assembling mole - cules that have hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments . In general nanocarriers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains are capa - ble of transporting hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs . The newer generations of nanocarriers include complex hydrogels made of a mixture of natural and nonnatural components [ 12 ] , and other complex polymers like dendrimers [ 13 , 14 ] which are branched polymers . Furthermore , stimuli - responsive polymers , such as those that change structure in response to a change in temperature or pH or even a physical stimulus have been incorporated into drug delivery systems [ 15 , 16 ] . Newer nanocarriers include viruses [ 17 , 18 ] , metal - or oxide - based nanocarriers ( gold , magnetic , quantum dots , titanium dioxide , zinc oxide , and silica ) [ 19 – 27 ] , carbon based nanocarriers ( nanotubes and fullerenes ) [ 28 – 30 ] , and hybrids of materials such as lipid - coated or polymer - coated nano - carriers [ 31 – 33 ] . As new nanomaterials are generated and new nanocarriers are designed for various biomedical applications , it is important to characterize them for their physiochemical properties , toxicity , and biodistribution as described elsewhere [ 34 ] . 4 Reema Zeineldin and Joan Syoufjy 3 Nanotechnology for Prevention and Diagnosis of Cancer Prevention of cancer utilizes nanocarriers that deliver tumor - speciﬁc antigens to immune cells to elicit an immune response against cancer [ 35 ] . Diagnosis of cancer may be in the form of biosensing or diagnostic imaging [ 36 ] . Biosensing detects biomo - lecules that serve as biomarkers of cancers or detects cancer - speciﬁc cells such as cancer stem cells or circulating cancer cells . It may utilize the concept of lab - on - a - chip with employing nanocompo - nents or maybe based on utilizing nanomaterials to detect targets as reviewed elsewhere [ 37 ] . Imaging detects and monitors the cancer or may even assist in surgery to guide excision of cancerous tissue . Imaging that utilizes iron oxide , gold nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes may have a theranostic value because these nanomaterials may be employed for therapy in addition to imaging through their thermal ablation capabilities [ 38 , 39 ] . The advantages of using nanomaterials in imaging include ( 1 ) their ability to generate and / or amplify imag - ing signals , ( 2 ) the development of new imaging technologies that are dependent on nanomaterial such as Raman imaging and photo - acoustic imaging , ( 3 ) their targeting ability because their surface can be functionalized with cancer - targeting moieties , ( 4 ) their multimodality because some nanomaterials can produce signals for more than one imaging technology , ( 5 ) their utility in detecting micro - metastases usually missed by non - molecular imaging meth - ods , and ( 6 ) some have a theranostic value . 4 Nanotechnology for Cancer Therapy The traditional antineoplastic agents used with cancer patients are cytotoxic agents that are referred to as conventional chemothera - peutic agents . The common molecular drug targets of the conven - tional chemotherapeutic agents include DNA , RNA , enzymes , tubulin , or microtubules [ 40 ] . More recent therapies include molecularly targeted therapeutics that target speciﬁc cellular mole - cules within cancers ( like inhibitors of receptors , transporters , sig - naling molecules , or transcription factors , antiangiogenic agents , and inhibitors of histone deacetylase ) or immunotherapies that enhance the immune response to ﬁght cancer [ 35 , 41 – 44 ] . In general the use of conventional chemotherapeutic agents presents several problems and the use of nanocarriers for drug delivery overcomes these problems . 4 . 1 Challenges with Conventional Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents Treating the patient with the conventional chemotherapeutic agents may cause the patient to suffer from several side effects of the drug including loss of hair , reduced formation of blood cells , and sterility [ 40 ] . The reason for this is that the chemotherapeutic Cancer Nanotechnology 5 agents are toxic chemicals that kill cells nonspeciﬁcally so they are cytotoxic to both cancer and non - cancer cells . For example , if the chemotherapeutic agent used targets dividing cells , then normal actively dividing cells within the body such as hair cells , gastrointes - tinal cells , blood cells , and germ cells will be affected by the drug [ 40 ] . Alternatively , if the chemotherapeutic agent targets molecules in cells whether dividing or not dividing , this also means that non - disease cells in general will be affected by the drug [ 40 ] . Additional challenges of conventional chemotherapeutic agents include : ( 1 ) many of them have low aqueous solubility ; ( 2 ) they get rapidly cleared by the liver and kidneys [ 40 ] ; and ( 3 ) there may be a reduced effect of these drugs due to overexpression of a drug - efﬂux pump resulting in drug resistance [ 45 ] . These problems may limit the dose , frequency or duration of treatments with the conventional chemotherapeutic agents . Nano - based therapies have the potential to overcome all of these limitations . 4 . 2 Advantages of Nanocarriers in Drug Delivery to Cancers Several of the above challenges can be counteracted through the use of different types of nanocarriers for drug delivery to cancers . The advantages of employing nanocarriers for drug delivery to cancers are summarized below . 4 . 2 . 1 Nanocarriers Can Deliver Hydrophobic Compounds Using nanocarriers permits delivery of poorly soluble drugs as they may be enclosed within hydrophobic interfaces of the nanocarriers or they could be bound to molecules that can serve as their carriers in the blood . 4 . 2 . 2 Nanocarriers Are Multifunctional Nanocarriers may be functionalized with various molecules through adsorption or chemical conjugations . Such molecules may include one or more drugs , an imaging agent , a targeting moiety such as a ligand or an antibody , and PEG . The loading of more than one drug is of importance in the case of drug resistance , so if the patient is not responsive to one drug , then presence of another or more drugs to which the patient appears to respond overcomes this problem . Carrying imaging agents in addition to drugs allows evaluating the responsiveness of cancer cells to the delivered drugs by visual evaluation of cancer tissue shrinkage , thus enabling theranostics . Adding a targeting ligand or antibody leads to speciﬁc active targeting of cancer cells by the drug - carrying nanocarriers with minimal effect on non - cancer cells . 4 . 2 . 3 Nanocarriers Passively and Actively Target Disease Cells Nanocarriers within the size range 20 – 400 nm may accumulate at i . e . , target the cancer site through passive targeting or enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect [ 46 ] . This results from the fact that the vascular endothelium lining the blood vessels at the cancer site exhibit large gaps in between cells and at the same time the cancer tissue lacks effective lymphatic drainage [ 47 ] . This causes leakage of nanocarriers through the gaps between 6 Reema Zeineldin and Joan Syoufjy endothelial cells into the cancer tissue where they get retained there because of defective lymphatic drainage , which results in targeting cancer tissue [ 46 ] . Not only can the nanocarriers carry more than one drug , but they can be loaded with high amounts of drugs especially if they are designed to target speciﬁc cancer cells through functionalization with targeting moieties so the nanocarriers serve as “magic bullets” [ 48 ] . A targeting moiety promotes active targeting of the cancer cells through molecules that are speciﬁcally expressed by the cancer cells , i . e . , tumor markers , or by molecules that are overexpressed by the cancer cells . For example , folate receptor alpha ( FR α ) is a tumor marker expressed by certain epithelial cancers while in normal tissue it is not accessible through the blood [ 49 ] . Receptors overex - pressed by cancer cells include epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , erbB2 , α v β 3 , CD20 , and CD25 [ 41 , 50 – 52 ] . In cancer , receptors on endothelial cells have been targeted to deprive cells from their blood supply . Examples for such receptors include integ - rins α 2b β 3 , α v β 3 , and α 5 β 1 , and aminopeptidase - N [ 53 , 54 ] . Actively targeting cancer cells or endothelial cells by nanocarriers results in more effective therapy while avoiding nonspeciﬁc toxicity to non - cancer cells . The fact that nanocarriers can passively and / or actively target disease tissue while sparing normal tissue the side effects of drugs opens new areas for improving drug loading of nanocarriers with the aim of reducing the drugs’ dose size . With traditional therapy it has been necessary to use high doses of drugs because drugs get metabolized by the liver or cleared through the liver and kidneys in addition to not being localized to the disease organ . In contrast , targeting of disease cells enhances the rate of bioavailability ( through passive and active targeting ) and intracellular delivery ( through active targeting involving endocytosis ) of the drug , which means smaller drug dose can be loaded onto nanocarriers . 4 . 2 . 4 Nanocarriers Prolong the Drug’s Circulation Time As discussed above modifying the nanocarriers with PEG is one way to prolong their blood circulation time . Other factors contributing to reducing the clearance of nanocarriers , thus prolonging their circulation time , include drug encapsulation and the nanocarriers’ size . Drug encapsulation within a nanocarrier protects the drug from being metabolized by liver enzymes . The increased size of the nanocarriers decreases their clearance through the kidneys , although other factors such as charge may affect such clearance [ 55 ] . 4 . 2 . 5 Nanocarriers Overcome Drug Resistance Another advantage of using nanocarriers for drug delivery is that they promote overcoming drug resistance through more than one mechanism . One way is presented above and it is based on loading more than one drug onto nanocarriers , and the second results from Cancer Nanotechnology 7 the nanocarriers’ avoidance of the drug efﬂux pump due to active targeting or the size of nanocarriers relative to pumped drug mole - cules [ 45 ] . 4 . 2 . 6 Nanocarriers Promote Safety and Tolerability of Drugs The use of nanocarriers increases the safety and tolerability of drugs as a result of the encapsulation of drugs in addition to the targeting to cancer site . Not all nanocarriers can be designed to encapsulate drugs , but the ones that do , prevent exposure of the blood and non - cancer cells to the drug and thus reduce the systemic side effects of drugs . The passive and the active targeting of the nano - carriers to the cancer site also prevent the unnecessary exposure of other cells to drugs and thus reduce the side effect of drugs . On the other hand , some nanocarriers may have their own toxicity and thus biocompatibility and studies on fate of nanocarriers are essential . 4 . 2 . 7 Nanocarriers Improve Other Technologies Other existing technologies such as delivery of gene silencing inhibitory RNA ( RNAi ) beneﬁt from the use of nanocarriers to speciﬁcally target disease cells while facilitating their entry into cells along with providing protection from cellular degradative nucleases . Different formulations of lipid nanocarriers and poly - mers have improved the delivery of RNAi [ 56 – 59 ] . More research is underway to improve their targeting to disease cells . 5 Opportunities for Research There is not sufﬁcient work on identifying mechanisms of uptake of nanocarriers and determining their fate within cells in addition to the fate of released drugs within cells . Active targeting of cell surface receptors usually leads to receptor - mediated endocytosis through endosomal pathway , in which a great percentage of the drug maybe trapped in the endosome or degraded . Releasing drugs from nanocarriers and endosomes may employ linkages that are cleavable within the environment of the endosome to which they are directed , and then the drug diffuses out of the endosome to reach its target within the cell . Release mechanisms for the drug from the nanocarriers include cleavage of thiolytic linkages or cleavage of acid labile linkages [ 60 ] . Alternatively when liposomes are used as nanocarriers , release of drugs can be triggered by employing mechanisms that destabilize phospholipids of liposomal nanocarriers such as applying heat [ 61 ] , ultrasonication [ 62 ] , or employing cancer - associated enzymes such as phospholipase A2 [ 63 ] and metalloproteases [ 64 ] . Release of drugs from endosomes can involve membrane penetrating peptides [ 65 , 66 ] or proton sponges [ 67 ] . Membrane penetrating peptides such as HIV Tat - derived peptide usually have basic amino acids that allow the pep - tides to penetrate through lipid bilayers [ 65 , 66 ] . When fused to 8 Reema Zeineldin and Joan Syoufjy drugs , they carry the drugs with them through the endosome’s bilayer . Proton sponges are endosmolytically active polymers con - taining amine groups that get protonated in acidic endosomes . Replenishing the protons through their inﬂux into endosomes along with chloride anions increases the osmotic pressure and ruptures the endosomes to release their content [ 67 ] . There are several other mechanisms for controlled release using stimuli - responsive “smart” polymers [ 68 ] . After the release of the drug from endosomes , it still needs to reach its target either in the cytoplasm or in another organelle . To achieve this goal nuclear targeting moieties such as nuclear signaling peptide [ 69 ] can be fused to drugs or nanocarriers that are designed not to release their cargo before reaching their destiny . Future research is needed to address physical stability issues of nanocarriers including settling , changing particle size , aggregation , and stability of their biofunctional groups ; in addition to evaluating the effect of conversion into dry form and sterilization . Finally , there are concerns about the toxicity of nanocarriers as several of them are made of nonbiodegradable materials . There is a need for animal studies not only to evaluate toxicity , but also to examine nanocarriers’ fate , improving tumor penetration , and pharmacoki - netic and pharmacodynamic studies , several of which are underway . 6 Partnership with Bio and Medical Personnel to Target Speciﬁc Diseases Interdisciplinary collaborations are essential for advancing disease - oriented nano - based diagnosis and therapy rather than material - oriented research [ 70 , 71 ] . However , there are not many educational graduate degree programs that provide a focused specialization in nanotechnology training for biomedical or health scientists . Most of the existing graduate degree pro - grams target training engineers , physicists and chemists and such programs in the USA are listed on the website of the National Nanotechnology Initiative [ 72 ] . There are a few notable graduate degree programs that train bio and health professionals in the ﬁeld and in the USA these include the University of Utah’s graduate program that requires interactions of multiple disciplines [ 73 ] , Louisiana Tech University [ 74 ] , Radiological Technological Uni - versity VT [ 75 ] , and Northeastern University programs [ 76 ] . Examples of international graduate degree programs for bio - students include those offered by four European educational institutions in the form of an Erasmus Mundus Master of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology [ 77 ] , Amrita Centre for Nanoscience in India [ 78 ] , Universidad de Alicante in Spain [ 79 ] , and Universite´ de Bourgogne in France [ 80 ] . All the above are examples of graduate - level degree programs that attract bio - students into specialization in the area of nanotechnology . On the other hand , few programs offer nanotechnology courses that Cancer Nanotechnology 9 present case studies for tackling speciﬁc cancer issues through nanotechnology . The ﬁeld still remains focused on new materials and designs and their potential for diagnosis and therapy rather than the other way around of focusing on studying a disease and its challenges with studying how nanotechnology can address these challenges . Thus partnerships with physicians and biomedi - cal and health scientists remain lagging behind mainly due to the lack of educating such personnel in the ﬁeld leading to their focus on fears of toxicity of materials rather than the potential of apply - ing nanotechnology to address challenges of diseases .

Accessed April 2016 12 Reema Zeineldin and Joan Syoufjy Chapter 2 Improved Targeting of Cancers with Nanotherapeutics Christian Foster , Andre Watson , Joseph Kaplinsky , and Nazila Kamaly Abstract Targeted cancer nanotherapeutics offers numerous opportunities for the selective uptake of toxic chemotherapies within tumors and cancer cells . The unique properties of nanoparticles , such as their small size , large surface - to - volume ratios , and the ability to achieve multivalency of targeting ligands on their surface , provide superior advantages for nanoparticle - based drug delivery to a variety of cancers . This review highlights various key concepts in the design of targeted nanotherapeutics for cancer therapy , and discusses physicochemical parameters affecting nanoparticle targeting , along with recent developments for cancer - targeted nanomedicines . Key words Targeting , Antibodies , Ligands , EPR , Cancer , Oncology , Nanoparticles , Nanotherapeu - tics , Nanomedicine , Multivalency , Drug delivery , Translation 1 Introduction Cancer chemotherapy is fundamentally limited by dose - limiting toxicity . This has long been true of nonspeciﬁc cytotoxic agents that are still the most widely used anticancer therapies , which in addition suffer from a low therapeutic index . The last 20 years has seen the development of molecularly targeted agents , which have an improved toxicity proﬁle , especially for acute events . However , these newer agents are often given continuously over longer time periods and chronic toxicity remains a key limiting factor [ 1 , 2 ] . With our improved understanding of cancer biology and path - ways , targeted agents and cancer immunotherapy approaches have gained considerable interest and investment , resulting in positive outcomes , and a rise in the use of these treatments . Targeted agents primarily include antibody drugs that are capable of speciﬁcally blocking proliferative cancer pathways , and immunotherapy approaches being aimed at priming the patient’s own immune system to attack and destroy cancers [ 3 , 4 ] . Surgery and radiother - apy are also still routinely used in the arsenal of anticancer treatments—along ( or in combination ) with chemotherapies , Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 2 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 13 targeted therapies , immunotherapy or newer treatments such as adoptive cellular therapy [ 5 ] . Cancer nanomedicines are intended to add to this arsenal of therapeutics , by packaging and speciﬁcally delivering existing chemotherapies to where they are needed the most : within cancer cells . Nanoparticles ( NPs ) enable the encapsulation of poorly soluble drugs , protection of a variety of therapeutic payloads from blood components , increase systemic circulation times and improve bio - distribution , leading to minimized systemic toxicities [ 6 ] . These properties are ideal for oncology applications where systemic toxic - ity is a major issue . Doxil , which is the ﬁrst anticancer nanomedicine to enter the clinic , is liposome - encapsulated doxorubicin , which was shown to drastically increase the systemic circulation half - life of doxorubicin ( Dox ) from 0 . 8 h to 2 days , in addition to reducing cardiotoxicity [ 7 ] . Albumin associated paclitaxel ( nab - PTX ) has also led to higher tolerated doses [ 8 ] . Once injected into systemic circulation , the localization of NPs within the body can be inﬂuenced via “passive” or “active” target - ing strategies . The term passive targeting describes the accumula - tion of NPs bearing no afﬁnity ligands at disease sites , where the degree of accumulation depends on their inherent physicochemical properties ( size , shape , charge , ﬂexibility , etc . ) . If suboptimal , these properties may also impede the effective concentration of NPs at active sites due to increased sequestration by the mononuclear phagocytic system ( MPS ) , limiting their systemic concentration and potential to extravasate into target tissues [ 9 ] . Active targeting is a term used to describe the mode of action of NPs with surface - bound afﬁnity ligands having speciﬁcity to diseased tissue and / or cells . Actively targeted particles rely on the principle of passive targeting discussed above , but targeting ligands have an additional effect , aiding accumulation in the tumor or uptake of NPs into cancer cells via endocytosis , or both . The development of actively targeted NPs was facilitated by the maturation of antibody technologies , together with techniques for bioconjugation of targeting moieties including antibodies , anti - body fragments , peptides , aptamers ( Apts ) , sugars , and small mole - cule ligands to the surface of NPs [ 10 – 13 ] . Although more than 30 years has passed since the ﬁrst targeted NPs were developed , only a handful have reached clinical translation , and none have yet been approved [ 14 – 17 ] . The lack of effective translation of targeted NPs could be attributed to the following limitations ; ( 1 ) our insufﬁcient understanding of events at the nano – bio interface both in vitro and in vivo ; ( 2 ) our inadequate knowledge of the fate of NPs at the body , organ , and cellular levels ; ( 3 ) difﬁculty in achieving reproduc - ible and controlled synthesis of targeted NPs at larger scales ; ( 4 ) lack of technologies enabling screening of a large number of tar - geted NP candidates under biologically relevant conditions that could be reliably correlated to clinical performance ; ( 5 ) potential 14 Christian Foster et al . lack of or low occurrence of the so - called enhanced permeation and retention effect ( EPR ) in patient tumors , and ; ( 6 ) inter - and intra - patient heterogeneity in receptor expression levels . In this review we discuss effective targeting of tumors via passive and active mechanisms , and highlight the various tumor biology and NP physicochemical properties that affect targeted nanodrug delivery for oncology applications . 2 Passive Targeting The growth of a solid tumor requires development of a blood supply and lymphatic drainage . However , the development of these sys - tems is pathological and this has profound implications for delivery of nanomedicines . Characteristics of the tumor vasculature such as excessive branching , chaotic structures , enlarged gaps between endothelial cell lining of vessel walls and associated breakdown of tight junctions , and a disrupted basement membrane , facilitate the extravasation of particulate materials from vessels into tumor tissues [ 18 , 19 ] . An impaired lymphatic drainage system further entraps macromolecular particles and delays their clearance . Starting in the 1980s , the observation of increased accumulation of macromo - lecules and colloids such as the polymer - drug conjugate poly ( sty - rene - co - maleic acid ) - neocarzinostatin ( SMANCS ) in tumor tissues led to the term “enhanced permeability and retention” ( EPR ) effect [ 20 ] . Together with grafting of polyethylene glycol ( PEGylation ) to the surface of NPs ( to enhance systemic circulation ) , this has become the most widely exploited concept in nano - oncology appli - cations [ 20 – 24 ] . The EPR effect has been observed with a wide range of macromolecular agents such as : proteins , including immu - noglobulin G ( IgG ) ; drug - polymer conjugates ; micelles ; liposomes ; polymeric NPs and many other types of NPs [ 25 – 28 ] . The distribution of NPs within tumors begins with margin - ation toward the vascular wall , followed by extravasation from the blood vessels , diffusion throughout the extravascular tissue and interaction with extracellular and intracellular targets [ 6 ] . The degree of vascular permeability in patients is far more heteroge - neous than in pre - clinical models . Variable tumor microenviron - ments can affect the cutoff size for NP accumulation in tumors , restricting their effective penetration range , and accounting for the lack of observable EPR effects in certain tumor types [ 29 , 30 ] . The negative pressure gradient present within the tumor interstitium can substantially limit the convection of NPs from the intravascular to the extravascular space within tumors , regardless of the presence of leaky vasculature [ 29 , 31 , 32 ] . The EPR effect is more highly multifaceted than ﬁrst thought . Only recently are we beginning to understand the contribution of other tumor microenvironment ( TME ) related parameters such as Improved Targeting of Cancers 15 blood circulation in tumors , extravasation to the perivascular tumor microenvironment , tumor - associated macrophages ( TAMs ) , ﬁbro - blasts , collagen , penetration distance within tumor tissue , tumor cell internalization and intracellular trafﬁcking ( and other tumor matrix components ) . Although the EPR effect has been the main principle governing the use of nanomedicines for tumor therapy , a number of important limitations need to be considered . The main observations of EPR have been studied in small animal subcutane - ous or orthotopic xenografts , and genetically engineered mouse models [ 33 ] . These settings are drastically different from tumors in humans where the EPR effect may not be present or manifested in a similar manner . Other than the observation of marginal progression - free survival in the case of ovarian cancer patients ( receiving Doxil as a second line therapy or platinum - sensitive cohorts ) , passively targeted NPs up to now have not led to substan - tial improvement in patient survival rates , which may suggest patient populations with lowered tumor susceptibility to NPs and / or lack of EPR effect [ 6 , 34 – 36 ] . More importantly , it appears that the EPR effect can also vary substantially between patients , with variability arising even within the same patient or tumor type [ 6 ] . To circumvent these problems , in the same manner that molec - ularly targeted treatments are currently offered to patients follow - ing genetic proﬁling of their tumors , more personalized approaches could be envisioned for the future where “nanomedicine - respon - sive” patient populations can also be identiﬁed . Research on com - panion diagnostics is helping to address this complex problem . In preclinical models , iodine loaded liposomes have been used to predict animal cohorts that were responsive to nanotherapeutics [ 37 ] . In another recent preclinical study magnetic resonance imag - ing ( MRI ) was used to predict treatment response and drug accu - mulation using co - administered 30 nm magnetic iron oxide NPs and paclitaxel encapsulated polymeric NPs in tumor - bearing mice [ 38 ] . In the clinic , a study was initiated to ascertain the safety of co - administering ferumoxytol as a tumor imaging agent , in addition to irinotecan - loaded liposomes ( clinicaltrials . gov , NCT01770353 ) . These approaches have yielded valuable insights into the in vivo kinetics of NP biodistribution and demonstrated how clinically relevant imaging modalities and agents can be utilized to select patients with high EPR and to predict therapeutic nanomedicine efﬁcacy using companion diagnostics . 3 Active Targeting Active targeting describes the use of afﬁnity ligands to direct NP binding to antigens that are overexpressed in diseased tissue . Actively targeted particles rely on the principle of passive targeting 16 Christian Foster et al . discussed above , but the addition of ligands can aid accumulation in the tumor and uptake of NPs into cancer cells via endocytosis . A wide variety of targeting ligands are used to create targeted NPs ( Table 1 ) . These ligands are often directed toward overex - pressed receptors or antigens on proliferating cancer cells . Impor - tant parameters that should be taken into account when choosing a targeting ligand include binding afﬁnity , ligand size , immunogenic - ity , and cost of manufacturing . The ideal ligand should also facili - tate deeper tumor penetration . The ﬁrst antibody to be approved for clinical use was muromonab - CD3 ( an immunosuppressive agent ) in 1986 [ 39 ] . Since then numerous antibody platforms have been developed Table 1 Examples of targeting ligands and targeted NPs Ligand Type Nanoplatform Target Indication ( Ref ) Antibodies and fragments l F ( ab 0 ) 2 Liposome Non - muscle myosin heavy chain type A Gastric cancer [ 63 ] l F ( ab 0 ) Liposome HER2 Breast cancer [ 144 ] l scFv Liposome HER2 Breast cancer [ 58 ] Proteins l Transferrin Polymeric NPs Tf receptor Cancer [ 59 ] l Ankyrin repeat protein siRNA complexes EpCAM Cancer [ 145 ] l Afﬁbodies Polymeric NPs HER2 Breast cancer [ 146 ] Peptides l CGNKRTRGC ( LyP - 1 ) Protein NPs gC1qR ( p32 ) Cancer [ 147 ] l F3 peptide Iron oxide NPs Nucleolin Cancer ( imaging ) [ 148 ] l iRGD Iron oxide NPs α v β 3 / 5 Cancer ( imaging ) [ 149 ] l iRGD Polymeric NPs α v β 3 / 5 Cancer [ 150 ] l KLWVLPKGGGC Polymeric NPs Collagen IV Inﬂammation [ 151 ] l KLWVLPK Polymeric NPs Collagen IV Vascular wall [ 152 ] l SSPIQGSWTWENGK - WTWRGIIRLEQ Iron oxide Fibronectin Cancer ( Imaging ) [ 153 ] l SSPIQGSWTWENGK - WTWRGIIRLEQ Liposomes Fibronectin Cancer Nucleic acid ligands l A10 aptamer Polymeric NPs PSMA Prostate cancer [ 154 ] l A9 CGA aptamer Gold NPs PSMA Prostate cancer [ 155 ] Small molecule ligands l Folic acid Liposomes FA receptor Cancer [ 56 ] l Folic acid Polymeric NPs FA receptor Cancer [ 156 ] l TPP Polymeric NPs Mitochondria Various [ 157 ] l ACUPA Polymeric NPs PSMA Cancer [ 158 ] HER2 : human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 .

For example , rituximab ( Rituxan ) is a chimeric mAb , which binds to CD20 , and was approved for the treatment of non - Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1997 [ 41 ] . Trastuzu - mab ( Herceptin ) which was approved for the treatment of breast cancer in 1998 is a humanized mAb that binds to the HER2 / neu antigen [ 42 ] . Natural or fully synthetic antigen - binding fragments ( Fab and Fab 0 ~ 50 kDa ) , variable fragments ( Fv ~ 15 kDa ) , and single chain variable fragments ( scFv ~ 30 kDa ) of antibodies have been engineered and tested [ 43 ] . Antibody fragments are engi - neered to control properties such as afﬁnity ( K D usually lower than 1 nM ) or internalization capability . The advantage of anti - gen - binding fragments is that they lack the Fc - antibody region , which is the most immunogenic component of antibodies . Several other classes of binding ligands , including antibody mimetics , peptides , nucleic acid ligands , and small molecules , have been developed against a number of target antigens [ 43 ] . These types of ligands can also be conjugated to radioisotopes or drug molecules to create more effective targeted imaging and therapeutic modalities [ 44 – 47 ] . Similar ligands can be conjugated to the surface of NPs in order to achieve antigen - speciﬁc active targeting [ 43 , 48 ] . In contrast to antibody – drug conjugates , which typically carry 1 – 8 drug molecules , targeted NPs are capable of carrying up to 10 5 drug molecules , allowing for a higher amount of drug delivery per bio - recognition or binding event . For effective cancer therapy , drug encapsulating NPs should ideally be delivered within cancer cells , and therefore therapies that act on intracellular active sites are most effectively delivered with targeted NPs since this facilitates uptake of NPs via either clathrin - dependent endocytosis , caveolin - assisted , cell adhesion molecule directed , or lipid raft associated mechanisms [ 49 ] . In the case of hydrophobic small molecule drugs that can easily permeate through the endosomal lipid bilayer , NP entrapment within endo - somes following endocytosis can still lead to effective intracellular drug concentrations as the drug molecules are released from the carrier over time . In contrast , for the effective delivery of biological macromolecules such as nucleic acids ( DNA , siRNA , miRNA ) , charged / and or hydrophilic small molecule drugs ( that are impermeable to the endosomal membrane ) , endosomal escape is an important prerequisite [ 50 ] . This is crucial since intracellular payload release should occur prior to fusion of endosomes with lysosomes where biological payloads can be degraded as a result of low pH levels [ 51 ] . Studies to identify mechanisms that lead to endosomal escape based on pH buffering and osmotic swelling , which cause endosome bursting or endosomal membrane destabi - lization for the purposes of effective subcellular drug delivery are helping to further understand this effect [ 52 – 55 ] . 18 Christian Foster et al . Ligand mediated cell internalization can result in therapeutic beneﬁts as compared to equivalent non - targeted NPs [ 56 – 59 ] . For example , accumulation of siRNA - loaded NPs at tumor sites is largely a function of effective EPR via passive targeting ; however , cellular internalization and effective gene silencing are largely a function of targeting ligands , which facilitate intracellular uptake . Therefore , the colloidal properties of NPs determine their biodis - tribution , whereas the targeting ligand serves to facilitate and enhance cellular uptake at speciﬁc sites [ 60 ] . For effective tumor targeting and margination and extravasation of NPs for cancer therapy deeper tumor penetration and retention is important . Targeting strategies that focus on the TME can also be utilized to improve penetration . For example tumor - speciﬁc penetrating peptides such as iRGD with a R / KXXR / K C - terminal peptide motif have been used to stimulate neuropilin - 1 - mediated vascular permeability [ 61 ] . For targeting of nanomedicines in oncology applications parameters such as ligand binding afﬁnity ( K D ) and receptor expression levels throughout the treatment period also need to be considered . 3 . 1 Clinical Stage Actively Targeted Nanoparticles Over the last four decades since the ﬁrst actively targeted NPs were reported [ 62 ] , only a handful have progressed to clinical trials ( Table 2 ) . MCC - 465 , the ﬁrst targeted NP to enter trials , consists of liposome encapsulated Dox with surface bound PEG for immune shielding and dimers of F ( ab 0 ) fragments for targeting [ 15 ] . The F ( ab 0 ) 2 used is a fragment of the tumor speciﬁc human mAb ( GAH ) , which has shown afﬁnity to > 90 % of human stomach cancer cells [ 15 ] . MCC - 465 exhibited signiﬁcant antitumor response against GAH - positive xenografts leading to 80 % reduc - tion in tumor mass [ 63 ] . Phase I trials with MCC - 465 were carried out in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose and further dosing regimens . MCC - 465 does not appear to have progressed through clinical development after phase I completion . Anti - EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) immunolipo - somes loaded with doxorubicin ( anti - EGFR ILs - dox ) have been tested in the clinic on patients with advanced solid tumors over - expressing EGFR no longer amenable to standard treatment and a maximal tolerated dose was deﬁned ( 50 mg / m 2 ) from the phase I trial [ 64 ] . MM - 302 is a HER - 2 - targeted PEGylated liposome that encapsulates doxorubicin for delivery to HER - 2 - overexpressing tumor cells , it is currently undergoing phase II and III trials for breast cancer and HER - 2 positive breast cancer respectively [ 65 ] . MM - 302 has been recently shown to improve the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin in HER - 2 positive breast cancer , when administered after cyclophosphamide priming [ 66 ] . The overexpression of TfR , EGFR , and HER - 2 occurs in a range of cancer types , making these cancer ligands attractive targeting strategies for drug delivery [ 67 ] .

A P I : ac t i ve p h a r m ac e u t i ca l i n g r e d i e n t SGT - 53 is a transferrin receptor ( TfR ) - targeted liposome , which binds to TfRs on the surface of cancer cells using single - chain antibody fragments ( TfRscFv ) . Its payload is a plasmid encoding wild type tumor suppressor P53 [ 68 ] . Preclinical studies showed that SGT - 53 could sensitize tumors to the effects of radia - tion and chemotherapy [ 68 ] . It is currently undergoing phase I and II clinical trials in combination with Dox for treatment of solid tumors and metastatic breast cancer . SGT - 94 is a similar formula - tion to SGT - 53 . In SGT - 94 the P53 plasmid was replaced with an RB94 plasmid encoding a fragment of the wild - type retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein . SGT - 94 is undergoing Phase I trials in patients with RB negative tumor biopsies . MBP - 426 is another TfR - targeted liposome that encapsulates oxaliplatin [ 14 ] . In a phase I study , patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors refractory to conventional therapy received MBP - 426 as 2 – 4 h infusions every 3 weeks and it was well tolerated [ 14 ] . 2B3 - 101 is a targeted liposomal formulation of Dox using glutathione as a ligand . By targeting the glutathione receptor it is able to traverse the blood – brain and blood - CSF barriers . Phase II trials have taken place for glioma and for metastases of breast cancer to the brain or the leptomeninges . BIND - 014 is the ﬁrst targeted , controlled - release polymeric NP for cancer chemotherapy to reach clinical development . It is com - posed of PLA - PEG diblock polymer , that targets prostate - speciﬁc membrane antigen ( PSMA ) and encapsulates a docetaxel ( Dtxl ) payload [ 69 ] . PSMA is a transmembrane protein that is overex - pressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells and tumor - associated neovasculature of virtually all solid tumors [ 70 , 71 ] . BIND - 014 is currently in phase II trials for second - line therapy for patients with non - small - cell lung , metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancers , and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [ 72 ] . CALAA - 01 was the ﬁrst targeted polymeric NP to reach clinical use for siRNA delivery in 2008 [ 73 ] . The CALAA - 01 NP consists of siRNA that reduces the expression of the M2 subunit of ribonu - cleotide reductase ( R2 ) , cyclodextrin containing polymer ( CDP ) for siRNA condensation , adamantine - PEG ( AD - PEG ) for steric stabilization , and adamantine - PEG conjugated to human Tf ( AD - PEG - Tf ) to target the TfR which is overexpressed on the surface of many cancer cells [ 74 , 75 ] . CALAA - 01 currently has no further active trials after the completion of the phase I trial . 4 Optimal Biophysicochemical Parameters for Targeted Nanoparticles Properties such as size , shape , surface charge , surface chemistry , hydrophobicity , roughness , rigidity , and composition are termed the physicochemical properties of NPs and can inﬂuence the uptake and / or targeting of NPs to tumors and cancer cells ( Fig . 1 ) [ 76 ] . Improved Targeting of Cancers 21 Tumor targeted NPs must be able to effectively circulate , mar - ginate , and successfully bind to vascular targets or extravasate into tumor interstitium and ﬁnally become internalized in cancer cells . The combination of these events requires that the NPs have optimal size , shape and surface properties , Each of these aspects merits investigation when developing optimal tumor targeted NPs . In this section , we discuss these properties , which generally affect both passively and actively targeted NPs . NP biophysicochemical properties can signiﬁcantly affect their cell uptake , cell cytotoxicity , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and biodistri - bution ( BD ) in vivo . There is a strong interplay between each of these properties . Computational techniques ranging across scales from molecular dynamics through to simulation of ﬂuid ﬂow and tumor growth can help gain insight in to the optimal combination [ 77 , 78 ] . However , the complexity of the bio – nano interface still demands a comprehensive experimental approach . 4 . 1 Inﬂuence of Nanoparticle Size Nanoparticle size crucially effects three phases of biodistribution : circulation and clearance ; diffusion into and through tumor tissue ; and cellular internalization by tumor cells . NP sizes are most often given as hydrodynamic sizes , measured by dynamic light scattering . Other techniques , such as atomic force microscopy or electron microscopy are also sometimes used , and will generally measure smaller sizes for the same particles . Based on many studies , 10 – 150 nm is a generally accepted size range for the development of NPs for in vivo applications with most favorable in vivo circulation and biodistribution , and tumor uptake patterns [ 79 ] . These upper and lower sizes are mostly determined Fig . 1 Physicochemical properties of ligands and nanoparticles and the TME can affect their in vivo performance 22 Christian Foster et al . because of interactions with the immune system and kidney ﬁltra - tion cutoffs , respectively . In general the larger the NP , the lower the curvature will be , which can lead to increased interactions of opso - nins and more rapid in vivo clearance [ 80 ] . Larger NPs are more likely to be ﬁltered by the sinusoids in the spleen and cleared by the MPS cells , which include the Kupffer cells of the liver [ 81 ] . Furthermore , NPs smaller than approximately 5 . 5 nm have been shown to be rapidly cleared by glomerular ﬁltration in the kidneys [ 82 ] . For tumor accumulation , the upper limit for extravasation into solid tumors appears to be ~ 400 nm and it is generally observed that NPs < 200 nm in size can accumulate effectively within tumor tissue , with the 70 – 200 nm range considered optimal for tumor passive targeting [ 83 ] . In relation to diffusion within the tumor , intercapillary distances must be considered , since it is important for NPs to reach tumor cells that are located further away from these microvessels . Tumor matrix components such as collagen ﬁbers , extracellular proteins , increased interstitial ﬂuid pressure , heteroge - neous blood ﬂow , and impaired lymphatics towards the tumor core present challenges for the effective passive diffusion of NPs within tumors [ 84 , 85 ] . Work has shown that NPs of about ~ 10 – 20 nm are ideal for maximum tumor penetration [ 86 ] . Cellular internalization of NPs is highly dependent on the size of the NPs , and in general , particles in the 40 – 50 nm range exhibit maximal uptake in vitro [ 87 ] . For example , Herceptin ( HER ) gold NPs ( 2 – 100 nm ) were synthesized and their size - dependent bind - ing and uptake was investigated in ErbB2 receptor expressing cells [ 88 ] . Interestingly , studies have shown that NP uptake as a function of size can also be tumor cell type - dependent , and just a 10 nm deviation from an investigated optimal size , results in a signiﬁcant decrease in NP uptake [ 88 ] . Firstly it was shown that the number of HER antibody binding sites on the NPs was dependent on the NP surface area and increased with particle radius . Surface antibody density also increased linearly with NP radius—demonstrating that these multivalent antibody - conjugated NPs can allow for a high degree of ErbB2 cross - linking and can be tuned by varying NP size . Therefore , NP shape and size can change ligand presentation , affecting NP binding avidity . As noted above , animal models understate the extent of varia - bility of the EPR found in patient tumors . Yet even examples from the preclinical literature clearly show that optimal size is dependent on the model chosen . The size dependent accumulation of ﬂuorescently labeled PLA - PEG polymeric NPs using two different tumor xenograft models , HT20 colon and A2780 ovarian carcinoma , which result in different tumor structures , growth rates , and microenvironments was investigated [ 89 ] . The biodistribution and accumulation of near - infrared dye - loaded PLA - PEG NPs was tracked using in vivo Improved Targeting of Cancers 23 ﬂuorescence imaging technique . NPs with sizes 111 and 141 nm accumulated efﬁciently in tumors and a larger 166 nm NP was shown to undergo rapid clearance in the liver . The pattern of accumulation was variable in both tumors , although ﬂuorescence was mostly observed from the tumor core region in the case of HT29 tumors , which was not observed in the A2780 tumors . NP accumulation in the necrotic HT29 tumor core was shown to be size - independent , but size dependent in A2780 tumors , which were more vascularized . In general the larger NPs led to lower tumor accumulation . Tumor permeability and degree of vascularization are key concepts for the assessment of NP biodistribution in tumors . In hyperpermeable murine colon adenocarcinoma polymeric micelles of sizes between 30 and 100 nm were found to be similar in their accumulation , tumor extravasation , and treatment efﬁcacy [ 90 ] . However , in hypopermeable pancreatic tumors , only 30 nm micelles were shown to be effective [ 90 ] . Considering the diversity of nanomaterials and cell types used to investigate targeted NPs for cancer therapy , it is important that an optimal NP size be determined experimentally for a given NP type and cell type . 4 . 2 Inﬂuence of Nanoparticle Shape The interaction between NP shape and hemodynamic forces ( ﬂuid dynamics of blood ﬂow ) affects circulation through the blood . The interaction between shape and cellular internalization affects both the rate of clearance by the MPS and the rate of uptake by target cells . In relation to circulation of NPs in vivo , spherical NPs tend to be less susceptible to transport across streamlines by hemodynamic forces in the bloodstream . Certain studies , on the other hand , have shown that non - spherical particles with longitudinal lengths reach - ing cellular diameters and discoidal shapes can exhibit longer circu - lation times than spherical particles [ 91 , 92 ] . Discoidal particles have highly oscillatory trajectories that can increase their contact with vessel walls . Oblate - shaped NPs are susceptible to torques resulting in tumbling and rotation , leading to an increase in the lateral drift of NPs towards blood vessel walls in microvessels [ 93 ] . Furthermore , oblate - shaped particles are less susceptible to uptake by macrophages leading to increased blood circulation [ 91 , 94 , 95 ] . Vascular endothelium or cancer cell targeting seems to also favor oblong and more elongated NPs since these shapes offer greater avidity towards targets due to an increased multiva - lency , maximizing NP surface contact with targets [ 96 ] . In particu - lar for vascular targeting , geometrically enhanced targeting can avoid hemodynamic forces that can lead to NP detachment from the endothelium [ 97 ] . After systemic injection of a NP , before it reaches the cancer cells within tumors , it must ﬁrst evade phagocytosis by macro - phages , and marginate across the vascular wall against blood 24 Christian Foster et al . hemodynamic forces . This activity can be inﬂuenced by the tum - bling rate of the NP which is affected by its buoyancy , drag , van der Waals interactions , electrostatic double layer interactions , and steric repulsive behavior [ 98 ] . The movement of spherical NPs and their margination is size dependent [ 99 ] . This is because transport of larger spherical NPs is dominated by advection while smaller NPs are more prone to diffusion , which facilitates their extravasation across blood vessels . For examples , 65 nm liposomes were more than three times likely to marginate than 130 nm liposomes [ 100 ] . Nanoparticle shape is also an important factor in the rate of cellular internalization [ 87 ] , with shapes that can accommodate cellular membrane wrapping processes most effective at cellular uptake . Amongst NPs of either rod or sphere design , the spherical shaped NPs were taken up by cells more readily [ 101 ] . A wide variety of non - spherical NPs with different sizes and geometries have been manufactured using different methods [ 98 ] . A top - down fabrication method termed Particle Replication in Non - wetting Templates ( PRINT ) utilizes lithography techniques to create polymeric NPs of a wide variety of geometries , shapes and aspect ratios , and a study using cylindrical PLGA NPs created using this technique showed an increase in tumor levels of docetaxel with decreased liver and spleen uptake [ 102 , 103 ] . However , typical processes used to fabricate therapeutic NPs ( bottom - up fabrica - tion , self - assembly ) renders most nanomedicines spherical . In addi - tion to further studies of the in vivo effects of shape , new methods of synthesis for non - spherical NPs suitable for industrial scale - up is therefore an important area for future research . 4 . 3 Inﬂuence of Nanoparticle Surface Charge The degree of nonspeciﬁc binding of proteins to NPs in the blood is related to NP surface charge , because highly positively charged NPs are more rapidly cleared from circulation by cells of the MPS since they are more prone to opsonization [ 79 ] . Although cat - ionic NPs promote cellular binding ( due to interactions with the negatively charged phospholipids , proteins , and glycans on cell surfaces ) and can be ideal for in vitro applications of drug delivery to cancer cells [ 104 ] , in vivo this charge should be masked until the NPs are within the tumor . Negatively charged NPs can also exhibit selective cellular uptake compared to NPs with neutral surfaces [ 101 ] . Either the uptake of positively charged NPs could be an energy - dependent process involving the proteins dynamin and F - actin , or positively charged NPs can by - pass endo - cytic pathways and enter cells by creating holes in the cellular bilayer [ 104 , 105 ] . In vitro studies have shown that amino terminated surfaces induce the highest levels of complement activation [ 106 ] , and NPs with neutral methoxy surface groups were most immunocom - patible . Post systemic administration , NPs with zeta ( ζ ) potential < 15 mV exhibited minimal macrophage uptake and led to longer Improved Targeting of Cancers 25 circulation times and overall tumor retention [ 107 ] . When near neutral polymeric micelles ( ζ potential 1 . 3 mV ) and anionic ( ζ potential (cid:2) 10 . 6 mV ) were compared , the more negatively charged NPs resulted in lower liver and spleen accumulation [ 108 ] . Cation - ically charged NPs have a high nonspeciﬁc uptake in a variety of cells , and can also facilitate endosomal release through the so - called “proton sponge effect” [ 109 ] . In summary , the charge of NPs , which is related to their surface chemistry inﬂuences the degree of opsonization , and circulation time of the NP , and interaction with macrophages within organs of the MPS . Positively charged NPs are more prone to uptake by macrophages in the lungs , liver , and spleen . Neutral and slightly negatively charged NPs exhibit prolonged circulation lifetimes and lowered uptake by the MPS . 4 . 4 Inﬂuence of NP Rigidity Particle rigidity can highly inﬂuence both circulation and cellular uptake in vivo . This has long been studied in the case of larger structures , such as red blood cells . Synthetically engineered microparticles with both rigid and deformable properties were developed and their biodistribution evaluated in vivo [ 110 ] . The more deformable synthetic blood cells were eliminated 30 times more slowly than their rigid counterparts from blood , with the more rigid microparticles accumulating in the lungs 2 h post - injection . More recently , attention has been paid to the rigidity of NPs although this is still a preliminary area of investigation [ 111 , 112 ] . Rigidity affects circulation in capillaries . Healthy red blood cells tend to accumulate in the center of the capillary , leaving a cell - free sheath zone of several microns . In normal physiology this zone is also occupied by white blood cells and platelets that interact with the capillary wall . As referenced above , NPs tend to marginate toward the cell wall on the basis of size . Whether the correlation between stiffness and margination found for red blood cells extends down to the NP size regime is an open question . In relation to cellular uptake there is in vitro evidence that macrophages take up harder particles more efﬁciently , by phagocy - tosis , and softer particles less efﬁciently by macropinocytosis [ 112 ] . Although evidence is more scant , the same in vitro preference for harder particles is found in endothelial cells . Cancer cell lines show much greater variation , which is not surprising in view of their heterogeneity [ 112 ] . It may be that tuning particle rigidity is another parameter for personalizing tumor treatment . A key study which controlled for rigidity while holding other properties constant and investigated the NP size range was Zhang et al . who synthesized 120 nm poly ( carboxybetaine ) particles [ 113 ] . They used variable cross - linking of their zwitterionic mono - mers to achieve bulk moduli ranging from 180 to 1350 kPa . They showed that softest , more deformable NPs had a circulation half life 26 Christian Foster et al . of 20 h , more than twice that of the most rigid particles at 9 h . The softest particles also showed less than half as much spleen accumu - lation , probably aided by a capacity to squeeze through spleenic ﬁltration . Another study found similar behavior with PEG based hydrogel particles , although at the upper end ( greater than 200 nm ) of the size range relevant to NP drug delivery [ 114 ] . Considering the highly ﬂexible and deformable biconcave dis - coid shape of red blood cells , it is not surprising that the elastic modulus of NPs can also play an important role in their pharma - cokinetics and biodistribution , with more ﬂexible NPs navigating and traversing vessels and gaps more easily in vivo . Investigating targeted NPs with variable degrees of structural rigidity and ﬂexi - bility could be of high interest for effective tumor targeting strategies . 4 . 5 Inﬂuence of Nanoparticle PEGylation The large surface area - to - volume ratios of NPs can attract a “corona” type binding of blood proteins to their extremely curved surfaces [ 109 ] , with up to hundreds of proteins adsorbing onto their surfaces [ 115 ] . Hydrophobic surfaces tend to lead to higher levels of protein adsorption , and IgG proteins ( opsonins ) have high afﬁnities for hydrophobic surfaces [ 116 ] . In the case of small drug molecules plasma protein binding by abundant proteins such as albumin and alpha - 1 - acid glycoprotein can lead to increased bioavailability through the reduction of ﬁrst pass hepatic extraction . However for NPs , this can lead to their enhanced blood clearance by the MPS [ 9 ] . Binding of plasma proteins onto the surface of NPs ( opsonization ) is extremely rapid once the NPs are injected into the blood stream . The ability to graft hydrophilic neutral polymers of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) onto the surface of liposomes and polymeric NPs goes hand - in - hand with EPR discoveries and led to increased blood circulation times and improvements in tumor accumulation [ 12 , 23 , 75 , 117 ] . The grafting of PEG molecules onto the surface of NPs is termed PEGylation and is currently the most utilized technique for improving the pharmacokinetics , plasma half - life , biodistribution , and elimination of NPs in vivo [ 118 ] . Indeed , uncoated NPs have been observed to be rapidly cleared by the MPS [ 116 ] , and the density and thickness of the PEG layer can also inﬂuence opsonization and biodistribution of injected NPs . Surface - grafted PEG NPs exhibit reduced uptake by liver cells [ 119 ] . PEG conﬁgurations on the surfaces of NPs can present as extended brush - like structures , coiled mushroom or mushroom / brush intermediates . Brush - like PEG surfaces were shown to be more optimal to sterically suppress the approach and binding of opsonins such as the C3b protein [ 116 ] . PEGylation as a strategy for improving NP - based drug delivery has been recently discussed in an excellent review elsewhere [ 120 ] . Improved Targeting of Cancers 27 5 Emerging Considerations for Improving Targeted Cancer Nanomedicines The effective homing of targeted NPs to the required site of action faces numerous biological barriers , including the immune system and the TME . Opsonization driven sequestration , compromised vasculature , erratic blood ﬂow and high interstitial ﬂuid pressures all need to be overcome . In previous sections we discuss the variety of parameters that can be tailored and optimized in order to improve nanomedicine targeting to tumors and cancer cells . Fur - ther considerations that are more recently gaining momentum and interest are the realization of the importance of TME components and stimuli - responsive design elements for more controlled target - ing and drug delivery to cancer cells—and are discussed in the following sections . 5 . 1 The Tumor Microenvironment The tumor microenvironment ( TME ) includes subpopulations of genetically diverse cancer cells , genetically normal cells , vascular / endothelial cells , blood cells ( e . g . , erythrocytes , leukocytes , and thrombocytes ) together with the tumor interstial medium—with all these components having a role in cancer progression [ 121 ] . TAMs , cancer - associated ﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells have been shown to play a role in tumor progression . It is anticipated that reprogramming of the TME via non - cancerous cells can lead to tumor regression . For example targeting stromal cells has gained interest recently [ 122 , 123 ] . Stromal cells play a major role in tumor growth and maintenance—and their reprogramming can be a potential next - generation cancer treatment approach [ 124 ] . Another striking example is the use of immune checkpoint block - ade inhibitors to reprogram immunosuppressive TMEs . Nanotech - nology can offer solutions for the effective targeting of each of these components , and pathways . In particular the combination delivery of multiple chemotherapeutics can be achieved using tar - geted NPs . Nano - enabled synergistic combination drug delivery to cancer cells can more effectively kills these cells and minimize resistance [ 125 ] . 5 . 2 Stimuli - Responsive Nanomedicines Cancer produces an inevitable shift in homeostatic chemical equi - librium , such as ampliﬁed or triggered enzymatic activity , a change towards acidic pH , reductive or oxidative states , or an increase in reactive oxygen species [ 126 ] . These differential biochemical sig - natures can be exploited for the development of more precise therapies through NPs which sense these differences ( “endogenous stimuli” ) to trigger drug release . In addition to internally triggered drug release , externally controlled physical parameters ( “exogenous stimuli” ) such as local induction of thermal , electrical , ultrasound , or magnetic energy can also be used to trigger release [ 127 ] . Interest is growing in adding biologically responsive elements to 28 Christian Foster et al . NP design , to achieve more controlled output behaviors and thera - peutic outcomes . Release can be triggered by causing structural changes such as NP building block degradation , shedding of sur - face layers ( e . g . , PEG ) and charge switching ( neutral to positive ) , which can ultimately allow for better uptake into cancer cells . As with targeting generally , the goal of stimuli - responsive drug deliv - ery systems is to further minimize systemic toxicities and unfavor - able drug - plasma interactions to allow more efﬁcient dosing and treatment of disease . A range of endogenous stimuli such as changes in pH , redox state and ionic content within tissues and cells can be utilized for the development of chemically triggered drug release from poly - meric NPs . Solid tumors have acidic pH environments ( pH 6 . 2 – 6 . 9 ) [ 128 ] , that can be used to trigger chemical changes in the NP structure leading to increased drug release . Subcellular compartments also offer various low pH environments post uptake of NPs ( endosome , lysosome , cytosol , etc . ) , which can cause either surface layer shedding or conformational changes in NPs , leading to site - speciﬁc and increased drug release . 5 . 3 Subcellular Targeting Following cancer cell internalization through different endocytosis pathways , NPs need to release their therapeutic payload , which can further diffuse through the cellular compartments to reach the biological target . Cell cytosolic internalization is not always sufﬁ - cient for drugs to reach their targets via diffusion alone [ 129 – 135 ] . The cytoplasm contains a cytoskeletal network and numerous dis - persed organelles , with many dissolved macromolecules ranging in concentration between 50 and 400 g / L [ 136 , 137 ] . In the case of drugs that are recognized by efﬂux pumps ( e . g . , P - glycoprotein ) NPs that can be internalized by endocytosis and thus release their active drugs within speciﬁc subcellular organelles can be a way to reduce multidrug resistance in cancer cells [ 138 , 139 ] . Folic acid , low - density lipoprotein , cholera toxin B , mannose - 6 - phosphate , Tf , riboﬂavin , the tripeptide RGD , ICAM - 1 anti - body , and nicotinic acid are suitable endocytic targeting ligands that can be useful for subcellular localization of NPs [ 49 ] . Cellular internalization with these ligands can occur via clathrin - dependent receptor mediated endocytosis , caveolin - assisted endocytosis , lipid raft - associated endocytosis , or cell adhesion molecule ( CAM ) - directed cellular uptake [ 49 , 140 , 141 ] . Encapsulation of Dox into liposomes bearing Tfs on the distal end of PEG chains was shown to increase Dox uptake into glioma cells ( that overexpress TfRs ) [ 142 ] . The dynamic subcellular fate of polymeric micelles formed from ( 1 , 2 - diaminocyclohexane ) plati - num ( II ) ( DACHPt / m ) , the parent complex of oxaliplatin , was investigated in tumor tissues [ 143 ] . Potent antitumor activity was shown and the micelles were able to overcome Pt resistance both in vitro and in vivo . The extravasation of DACHP / m NP was Improved Targeting of Cancers 29 observed from blood vessels into tumors in addition to polymer dissociation within the cells . The polymeric NPs selectively disso - ciated in the late endosomes and facilitated Pt drug delivery to the nucleus relative to free oxaliplatin , by circumventing the cytoplas - mic detoxiﬁcation systems of metallothionein and methionine synthase , suggesting that NP intracellular targeting via compart - mentalization is an effective strategy for drug delivery . It would be of interest to understand the exact mechanisms of subcellular trans - port of NPs in order to improve their design and targeting functions . 6 Conclusions and Outlook Improving and ﬁne - tuning our understanding of tumor heteroge - neity and discovering EPR biomarkers can help identify “nanome - dicine - responsive” patients and further improve their clinical outcomes . Our understanding of NP transport to tumors and factors involved in their biodistribution and uptake within the TME is constantly expanding and will result in safer and more efﬁcacious nanotherapeutics . Investigating the challenges of con - trollable , reproducible and scalable NP synthesis , as well as large - scale NP screening and evaluation , will facilitate their more rapid clinical translation . Oncology is one area where nanomedicine products are set to make the most impact , where cell and tissue targeting approaches can be used to efﬁciently deliver cytotoxic and molecularly targeted drugs to cancer cells . Ultimately physicochemical parameters need to be investigated for successful design of targeted NPs , which include optimization of NP biophysicochemical properties and the demonstration of the efﬁcacy of targeted NPs in a clinical setting on their impact on patient treatment . Indeed , the value of tailoring these parameters with the purpose of minimizing toxicity , unfavorable interactions with the immune system , rapid renal clear - ance , and minimal accumulation in organs such as the liver and spleen is beginning to be more systematically recognized and more routinely investigated . Other than identiﬁcation of optimal ligands and ligand targets suitable for highly selective NP targeting , other important practical challenges in the development of targeted ther - apeutic NPs should also be considered including : ( 1 ) the use of biocompatible , biodegradable / bioeliminable materials ; ( 2 ) the use of simple , robust , and reproducible bioconjugation chemistries for the attachment of precursors and targeting ligands ; ( 3 ) facile NP assemblies that avoid multistep NP preparation and puriﬁcation steps ; ( 4 ) optimization of NP biophysicochemical properties to achieve , optimal drug load / release , long circulation half - life , suit - able biodistribution , differential target tissue accumulation , efﬁca - cious target tissue drug concentration and drug exposure kinetics ; 30 Christian Foster et al . ( 5 ) validation of NP stability and predictable shelf life ; and ( 6 ) development or adaptation of scalable processes and units of opera - tions amenable to the manufacturing of large quantities of targeted NPs for clinical development and commercialization . The ﬁeld is steadily progressing and we will see targeted nanomedicines en route to becoming valuable therapeutics in oncology with greater impact in the near future .

Torchilin Abstract Liposomes have come a long way since their conception in the 1960s , when they were envisioned primarily for drug delivery . Besides serving the important function of the delivery of a variety of drugs , liposomes offer a platform for the co - delivery of a range of therapeutic and diagnostic agents with different physico - chemical properties . They are also amenable to the addition of various targeting moieties such as proteins , sugars , and antibodies for selective targeting at a desired site , including tumors . Currently , the design of stimuli - sensitive liposomes for drug delivery is a lively area of research . Compared to conventional lipo - somes , stimuli - sensitive nanoplatforms respond to local conditions that are characteristics of the pathologi - cal area of interest , allowing the release of active agents at the targeted site . Acidic pH , abnormal levels of enzymes , temperature , altered redox potential , and external magnetic ﬁeld are examples of internal and external stimuli exploited in the design of stimuli - sensitive liposomes . The penetration of the liposomes into the cells can be enhanced with the help of a variety of cell penetrating peptides , which can be incorporated into the liposomes with the help of various lipid – polymer conjugates . Liposomes are now being employed in diagnostics as well . Imaging of a tumor can be made easier by the inclusion of ﬂuorescent probes . They can also be used for gamma or MR imaging using chelated reporter metals and incorporating them either into the core of the liposome or in the lipid bilayer facing outwards . In this chapter , we discuss methods that are commonly used for the preparation of liposomes with a vast range of functions to meet a variety of needs in diagnostics and drug delivery . Key words Liposomes , Multifunctional , Long - circulating , Tumor - targeting , Temperature - sensitive , pH - sensitive , Redox - sensitive , MMP - sensitive , Magnetically sensitive , Cell - penetrating 1 Introduction Liposomes are deﬁned as microparticulate vesicles composed of a mixture of phospholipids , where the lipids form concentric bilayers and are capable of encapsulating an aqueous phase in their core [ 1 , 2 ] . This property helps in the encapsulation of not only a wide range of therapeutic agents in the bilayer and hydrophilic agents in the aqueous core , but also enables the delivery of a high - payload of the intended drug . Liposomal technology has undergone tremen - dous change , since their development in the 1960s . First genera - tion liposomes were lipid bilayers encapsulating many therapeutic Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 3 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 41 agents with a wide range of physicochemical properties . Second generation liposomes improved upon this concept and with the addition of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) on their surface [ 3 ] . These liposomes acquired the property of “stealth , ” meaning that they could circulate in the body for a longer time by avoiding opsoniza - tion that causes recognition by the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) . This is a direct consequence of steric hindrance by the long PEG chains , resulting in increasing their circulation half - life . The third generation liposomes take it much further , allowing the engineering of complex liposomes which combined several func - tions at the same time , such as drug delivery , targeting at the site of action as well as cell organelles , penetration and accumulation at the site of action , stimuli - sensitive function , and imaging / diagnosis . Liposomes are now increasingly used in clinical settings and are very popular due to their salient properties . Numerous such formula - tions are now in the market and many more in clinical trials [ 4 ] . In this chapter we discuss the various types of novel , “smart” lipo - somes that are demonstrating promising potential for cancer ther - apy . See Fig . 1 for a schematic of a multifunctional liposome . 1 . 1 Preparation of Liposomes The simplest method to prepare liposomes is by a technique known as thin - ﬁlm hydration . Brieﬂy , an organic solution containing the desired lipid mixture is dried under vacuum by using a rotary evaporator , forming a ﬁlm . This ﬁlm is rehydrated using an aqueous buffer by simple agitation . Methods such as shaking , mixing using a vortex result in large multi - lamellar vesicles , which can be further broken down into PEG - stimuli sensitive linker - PE Ab - PEG - PE CPP - PEG - PE PEG - PE Magneticnanoparticle Lipophilic drug Hydrophilic drug Imaging agent Bilayer Lipid Fig . 1 Schematic representation of a multifunctional liposome 42 Bhawani Aryasomayajula et al . small unilamellar vesicles using methods such a sonication or extru - sion . These two methods yield liposomes with a narrow size distri - bution . Another method proposed by Szoka and Papahadjopoulos [ 2 ] known as reverse - phase evaporation relied on the creation of inverted micelles in an organic solvent and the slow removal of the organic solvent leading ﬁnally to the formation of unilamellar vesi - cles . The advantage of this technique is that it can encapsulate a large amount of drug but the use of an organic solvent might interfere with the encapsulation of proteins on account of denaturation . 1 . 2 Preparation of Long - Circulating “Stealth” Liposomes Classical liposomes are susceptible to rapid clearance by the mono - nuclear phagocytic system also knows as the RES [ 5 ] . An effective way to prolong their circulation is to graft long chain poly ethylene glycol ( PEG ) on the surface of the liposomes . PEG chains confer many important traits such as decrease in hydrophobicity , decrease in immunogenicity , increase in stability and steric hindrance to protect against opsonization and clearance [ 3 , 6 ] . Long chain PEG can range from 1 to10 KD and its hydroxyl terminal be coupled with a lipid anchor such as DSPE ( 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - gly - cero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ) and DOPE ( 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - gly - cero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ) . via various chemical reactions . These PEG chains can be incorporated into the liposomes either during the preparation of the liposomes [ 7 ] , or after they have been manufactured via a technique known as post insertion [ 8 ] . The use of PEG not only helps in sterically stabilizing the liposomes but also provides an opportunity for the attachment of various targeting ligands , cell - penetrating peptides , stimuli - sensitive linkers , etc . by the use of functionalized PEG polymers [ 9 – 11 ] . This chapter describes a simple method to insert PEG into prepared liposomes using a technique known as post insertion . 1 . 3 Preparation of Liposomes Functionalized with Speciﬁc Ligands for Selective Targeting to Tumors To selectively target liposomes to tumor tissues , a plethora of targeting ligands have been used . The strategy of active targeting is based on attaching a ligand to the liposomes surface , which can bind to speciﬁc components that are either selectively or overex - pressed in tumor cells . These targeting moieties includes ligands such as folate for targeting folic acid receptors [ 12 ] , transferrin for transferrin receptors [ 13 ] , and antibodies such as anti - HER2 [ 14 ] , nucleosome speciﬁc antibodies [ 9 ] to name a few . In this section we describe an efﬁcient way of grafting an antibody known as 2C5 , which targets the nucleosomes that are overexpressed on the sur - face of cancer cells [ 15 , 16 ] , onto a PEG chain of a chosen length , which can be subsequently incorporated into liposomes as described by Torchilin et al . [ 15 ] . Multifunctional Liposomes 43 1 . 4 Preparation of Liposomes Containing Stimuli - Sensitive Moieties Tumor tissue differs from normal tissue in numerous ways such as an acidic and reducing environment , overexpression of a speciﬁc enzymes including matrix metallo - proteases ( MMPMetallo - prote - ase ) , receptors such as transferrin receptors , folate receptors to name a few [ 12 , 13 , 17 – 19 ] . Designing liposomes with lipids and polymers that respond to these stimuli is an effective way to target them to the site of action and achieve a selective release of the drug . Moreover , the use of external triggers such as temperature and magnetic stimulus can also guide the liposomes externally , thereby making the therapy more effective . In this chapter we describe a few methods to render the liposomes sensitive to various types of stimuli , internal and external . 1 . 4 . 1 pH - Sensitive Liposomes Anaerobic glycolysis in tumor tissue causes lactate secretion and its accumulation , giving rise to a lower pH in the tumor tissue [ 20 ] . Furthermore , one of the predominant mechanisms of uptake of the liposomes into the cells is their incorporation into the endocytic pathway wherein , the pH steadily decreases from about 6 . 5 to 4 . 5 depending on the stage of the endocytic vesicles [ 21 ] . This phe - nomenon can be exploited to bring about site - speciﬁc delivery of the drug by the use of lipids that are shaped conically and inverted conically at neutral pH . At a more acidic pH , these lipids undergo protonation , change their shape from conical to cylindrical and hence destabilize the liposomes , thereby losing the liposome’s lamellar structure [ 22 ] . DOPE is frequently used in such formula - tions , owing to its conical shape , in conjunction with lipids such as cholesterolhemisuccinate ( CHEMS ) , long chain fatty acids such as oleic acid . Another method of creating a stimuli sensitive nanocar - rier is by the use of pH sensitive lipid – polymer conjugates such as PEG - HZ - PE ( a hydrazone based acid sensitive PEG - PE [ 23 ] ) to provide an outer shell for imparting long circulation function by warding off opsonins via steric hindrance , and eventually losing the PEG shell upon encountering a low pH environment for imparting enhanced penetration . Shown here is an example of a simple pH sensitive liposome as detailed by Ishida et al . , using DOPE , CHEMS , and PEG - PE for steric stabilization , although more complex lipid compositions have been optimized to ﬁt various needs [ 24 ] . 1 . 4 . 2 Redox - Sensitive Liposomes There exists a huge difference between the redox potentials of extracellular and intracellular environments . The extracellular space is known to be oxidizing , and intracellular , reducing [ 25 , 26 ] . This is attributed to the presence of a large amount of GSH ( glutathione ) , cysteine and other such reducing agents . In tumor tissue as well , GSH levels have been found to be about 100 fold higher than extracellular GSH levels [ 27 ] . When nanocarriers are designed with special polymers that contain bonds that can undergo reduction , such as disulﬁde bonds , then the GSH 44 Bhawani Aryasomayajula et al . destabilizes the liposomes and releases their payload . The most commonly used polymers for designing these kinds of liposomes consist of a disulﬁde linkage , which is a covalent linkage formed by the oxidation of two sulfhydryl ( SH ) groups . These linkages are reversible and make use of the disulﬁde to thiol reduction reaction . PEG chains with a disulﬁde linkage are redox sensitive PEG and their incorporation into liposomes results in designing nanocarriers with a sheddable PEG coating . Polymers such as 1 , 2 - Dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( DOPE ) / CHEMS ( 3 β - hydroxy - 5 - cholestene 3 - hemisuccinate ) / mPEG - DTP - DSPE ( PEG coupled with 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine using 3 , 3 0 - dithiopropionate as the linker ) [ 28 ] , PEG - DTH - DSPA ( PEG cou - pled with 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphatidic acid using the linker dithio - 3 - hexanol ) [ 29 ] , PEG - DTB - DSPE ( PEG coupled with 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine using dithiobenzyl carbamate linkers ) [ 30 ] , and PEG - S – S - DSPE ( PEG coupled with 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine using a thiolytic cleavable spacer ) [ 31 ] are frequently employed in designing such liposomes . In this chapter , we describe a simple chemical reaction for the synthesis of a dilsuﬁde bond between DOPE and PEG - SH as described by Maeda et al . [ 31 ] . 1 . 4 . 3 MMP - Sensitive Liposomes The presence of altered levels of certain local enzymes in cancer cells , such as matrix metallo proteinases ( MMPs ) have been used to develop enzyme - triggered nanoplatforms for drug delivery . Over - expression of MMPs , especially MMP2 and MMP9 , have been found in the tumor microenvironment , where they promote inva - sion , progression , and metastasis of most human tumors due to the degradation of the surrounding connective extracellular matrix [ 32 ] . Recently , Torchilin et al . successfully synthesized multifunc - tional MMP2 - sensitive liposomes for enhanced penetration of che - motherapeutic drugs into tumors [ 33 ] . Amino acid sequences that are sensitive to MMP2 can be introduced into PEG2000 - lipid derivatives and used to prepare MMP2 - sensitive PEGylated lipo - somes . The introduction of a stimulus - sensitive moiety between the PEG chain and the liposome allows to have long - circulation lipo - somes with local tissue environment controlled release mechan - isms . The presence of PEG on the surface of nanocarriers results in reduced cellular uptake and hinders the endosomal release of a carrier , the well - known “PEG dilemma” [ 34 ] . Hence , the incor - poration of MMP2 - sensitive PEG derivatives on the surface of liposome has the aim to “de - shield” the protective PEG function once in the tumor microenvironment , where the overexpressed levels of the proteolytic enzymes cleave the enzyme - sensitive link - age , allowing for efﬁcient liposomes cellular uptake . In this chapter , we describe a simple chemical reaction for the synthesis of a MMP2 - sensitive PEG derivative and its incorporation in liposomes as described by Zhu Lin et al . [ 33 ] . Multifunctional Liposomes 45 1 . 4 . 4 Temperature - Sensitive Liposomes ( TSL ) The ultimate goal of any chemotherapeutic agent is to penetrate across the vasculature and accumulate at the site of action to bring about cytotoxicity . Mild hyperthermia ( heating up to 43 (cid:2) C ) is known to bring about tumor shrinkage via various mechanisms , making it a viable tool for combination therapy with radiation , chemotherapy , etc . Mild hyperthermia has been shown to increase the tumor perfusion and vascular permeability , making it a great tool for also increasing the accumulation of liposomes in the tumor tissue . It was found that the use of certain lipids in the liposomes makes the liposomes thermally sensitive causing the release of drug at the tumor site , further enhancing the effect . This involves the use of lipids that undergo gel - liquid crystalline phase transition at tempera - tures ( T C ) slightly higher than the body temperature . Such lipo - somes were ﬁrst described by Yatvin and Weinstein in 1970s . These liposomes employed the use of the lipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl - choline ( DPPC ) with T C of 41 (cid:2) C [ 35 ] as the thermosensitive component , along with the use of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine ( DSPC ) with a higher T C of 54 (cid:2) C [ 35 ] in the ratio of DPPC : DSPC 3 : 1 , to yield liposomes with T C around 41 (cid:2) C [ 36 ] . Since then great strides have been made with regard to temperature - sensitive liposomes . One such formulation , Thermodox ® is currently in the Phase 3 trial for the treatment primary liver cancer ( hepatocel - lular carcinoma ) . Thermodox was developed by optimizing various lipid ratios for maximum release of the contents . They discovered that the incorporation of a highly bilayer compatible lysolipid , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - hydroxy - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( MPPC ) instead of the frequently used DSPC , in DPPC liposomes , confers the lipo - somes a better drug release proﬁle [ 37 ] . TSLs now include a wide range of lipids ( such as egg phosphatidyl choline and cholesterol ) to suit speciﬁc requirements and frequently include PEG for long cir - culation . This chapter presents a simple protocol for manufacturing the traditional TSLs as reported by Gaber et al . This method makes is a departure from the ﬁrst TSL as it includes cholesterol for increased stability and improved release kinetics [ 38 ] . 1 . 4 . 5 Magnetic - Sensitive Liposomes Magnetic metals and alloys such as iron [ 39 ] , cobalt [ 40 ] , iron oxides such as magnetite ( Fe 3 O 4 ) and maghemite ( Fe 2 O 3 ) are frequently used for designing nanoparticles which can be manipu - lated with an external magnetic ﬁeld . Coating with biocompatible polymers such as dextran , PEG or encapsulation inside a lipid vesicle provides the construct with not just the ability to be guided to the target site of action by the use of an external magnetic ﬁeld , but also enables imaging of the nanoparticles using MRI and also allows for treatment by magnetic hyperthermia . The commonly used super - paramagnetic nanoparticles are made of iron oxide , earning them the name super - paramagnetic iron - oxide nanoparti - cles ( SPIONS ) . SPIONS can either be synthesized by breaking 46 Bhawani Aryasomayajula et al . down larger particles using mechanical attrition , or by the more efﬁcient and more frequently used method of building up from smaller particles using chemical methods . One of the more widely used chemical methods is known as co - precipitation , where iron oxide is synthesized from Fe 2 + or Fe 3 + salt solutions ( chlorides , sulfates , nitrates ) by the addition of a base at either room or elevated temperatures [ 41 ] . Synthesis of liposomes using magnetic nanoparticles is a two - step process that ﬁrst includes the synthesis of the magnetic nanoparticles , and then their incorporation into the liposomes . Alternatively , magnetic nanoparticles such as mag - netite can be purchased to ﬁt various needs such as size , dispersion , and functionalized coating . The synthesis of magnetic nanoparticle by co - precipitation has been described in details in various papers [ 42 , 43 ] and hence we focus on the preparation of liposomes using them . 1 . 5 Adding Cell Penetration Function It is well known that the plasma membrane of the cell presents a formidable barrier to the penetration of a plethora of nonessential molecules and drugs . To improve the penetration of drugs and nanoparticles across the cell membrane , the use of cell penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) is increasingly gaining popularity . CPPs are usually short ( less than 40 ) amino acid sequences that are amphipathic and mostly positively charged [ 44 ] . The ﬁrst CPP to be identiﬁed was the Transactivator of Transcription of human immunodeﬁciency virus ( TAT peptide ) isolated from the HIV virus in the 1980s [ 45 ] . Since then , a large number of CPPs such as R8 , transportan , and Pep - 1 have been discovered and widely used for transporting drug molecules , peptides , proteins , oligonucleotides , nano - formulations , etc . across the cell membrane [ 46 ] . In this chapter , we describe the conjugation of the CPP known as TAT peptide , to a PEG chai , which can be introduced into the liposomes via post - insertion . 1 . 6 Adding an Imaging Function Liposomes can be used for various imaging modalities such as mag - netic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , computed tomography [ 40 ] , ultra - sound , and gamma scintillography . A wide range of agents such as Technetium ( Tc ) , Gadolinium ( Gd ) , Indium ( In ) , microbubbles made of Argon ( Ar ) , and air can be encapsulated into the liposomes for this purpose . Imaging requires a sufﬁcient amount of signal being emitted from the tissue to allow for a contrast between normal tissue and the tissue under investigation . This demands a high payload of the contrast agent , and liposomes are an efﬁcient way to deliver them . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) is a widely used modal - ity in medical imaging . This technique employs radioactive tracers attached to biologically active molecules such as 18 - ﬂuorine ﬂuoro - deoxyglucose ( FDG ) , 64 Cu diacetyl - bis ( N 4 - methylthiosemicarba - zone ) , and technetium - 99 m . Upon uptake into the organ of Multifunctional Liposomes 47 interest , the radioactive tracers undergo decay and emit positrons , which undergo annihilation by electrons , thereby emitting photons which have energies and can be detected by imaging [ 47 ] . PET is heavily employed in imaging tumors and is increasingly making its way into liposomal technology [ 48 , 49 ] . In this chapter we present incorporation of FDG into a liposomal formulation , which is fre - quently used for imaging tumor tissue . 1 . 7 Characterization of “Conventional” Liposomes and Stimuli - Sensitive Liposomes The mean diameter and the size distribution of liposomes are usually determined by dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) . The size distribution of multifunctional liposomes is generally unimodal , in the range of 150 – 200 . Interestingly , the size of liposomes does not change signiﬁcantly after the introduction of stimuli - sensitive con - jugates . To conﬁrm the results obtained from dynamic light scat - tering , it is recommended to evaluate the size distribution and the morphology by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . The presence of the ligands on the surface of the liposomes can be investigated by surface charge analysis performed using a Zeta Phase Analysis Light Scattering ( PALS ) UltraSensitive Zeta Poten - tial Analyzer instrument . 2 Materials 1 .

Evaporate the organic phase using nitrogen or a rotary evaporator , to form a thin ﬁlm . To ensure complete evapora - tion of the organic phase , freeze - dry the ﬂask for a few hours ( see Note 3 ) . 3 . Hydrate the lipid ﬁlm using an aqueous buffer such as phos - phate buffered saline pH 7 . 4 ( PBS ) and HEPES buffered saline Multifunctional Liposomes 49 pH 7 . 4 ( HBS ) and using mechanical agitation , detach the ﬁlm from the ﬂask to form a milky dispersion . 4 . Using a mechanical extrusion assembly , extrude the multila - mellar vesicles ( MLVs ) through ﬁlters of descending pore - size ranging from 400 to 50 nm . Optimize the range for optimal size distribution ( a particle size distribution under 0 . 2 is con - sidered optimal ) . 5 . Alternatively , using a probe sonicator , the MLVs can be broken down into small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) . Immerse the ﬂask in an ice bath . Immerse the tip of the sonicator into the RBF such that the tip is 1 cm above the bottom of the ﬂask , while still immersed in the dispersion .

Remove the organic solvent using the rotary evaporator at around 200 rpm at low pressure . No bubbles should be seen during the process . In case of bubbles , restart the procedure . Once the solvent has evaporated , a viscous gel will form at the bottom of the RBF . This gel will eventually collapse into an aqueous suspension . Reduce the pressure and keep on the rotary evaporator for a few more minutes ( see Note 6 ) . 7 .

Set up an automatic fraction collector using 13 small test tubes and collecting about 4 ml per fraction . Use no more than 300 ml of the eluent . 9 . Apply the entire sample to the column . Product loading onto column is thus about 1 . 8 % v / v and 0 . 4 % w / v . After draining the void volume of the column ( about 25 % column volume ) , start collecting 2 ml fractions . Analyze the fractions using TLC ( using ½ of a 20 (cid:3) 20 cm aluminium - backed sheet , and using a larger tank with 10 min development . As the product is a micelle , it is larger than the excess PEG , and will elute ﬁrst . 10 . Pool the fractions of interest and freeze under (cid:4) 80 (cid:2) C . 11 . Freeze - dry the frozen product to obtain a powder . Weigh and dissolve the powder in chloroform and store at (cid:4) 80 (cid:2) C . 3 . 5 Attachment of Antibody 2C5 to pNP - PEG 3400 - PE 1 .

Add the required amount of the 2C5 - PEG 3400 - PE micelles to the liposomes ( optimize the mol % of PEG ) and incubate over - night at 4 (cid:2) C ( see Note 11 ) . To prepare liposomes , use the methods described in the earlier sections and optimize for the quantity of 2C5 - PEG2000 - PE using in vitro association studies described in Subheading 3 . 16 , for achieving a signiﬁcant increase in active targeting without affecting the uptake of the liposomes by the cells . 3 . 6 Preparation of pH - Sensitive Liposomes Using CHEMS 1 . In a round - bottom ﬂask , prepare a mixture DOPE and CHEMS ( with CHEMS more than 20 mol % of the total lipid ) . 2 . Remove the organic solvent using a rotary evaporator or by drying under nitrogen in case of a smaller sample . Freeze - dry the sample to remove the organic solvent completely . 3 . Rehydrate the ﬁlm with an aqueous buffer such as HEPES buffer by sonication in a sonication bath for a few minutes . 4 . Transfer to a sealed tube and freeze using liquid nitrogen . Thaw at room temperature and repeat the procedure three times ( see Note 12 ) . 5 . Extrude the preparation using a 200 nm pore size ﬁlter 11 – 21 times . Optimize the number for a uniform size distribution . 3 . 7 Preparation of pH - Sensitive Liposomes Using PEG - HZ - PE 1 . In a round - bottom ﬂask , prepare a mixture of the desired lipids dissolved in an organic solvent such as chloroform or a mixture of chloroform and methanol 2 : 1 v / v . 2 .

Dis - solve and let the reaction proceed at RT for 5 h . 2 . Remove the methanol by evaporation under reduced pressure . Dissolve in 5 ml chloroform . 3 . To separate the product i . e . , PDP - DOPE , size exclusion chro - matography can be employed using Sepharose CL - 4B . Apply the sample and wash the silica gel column with 4 ml chloroform followed by 4 ml of each of the chloroform – methanol mixtures ranging from 4 : 0 . 25 , 4 : 0 . 5 , 4 : 1 , to 4 : 1 . 25 ( v / v ) . Collect 2 ml fractions and analyze by TLC . Pool the fractions containing the product and dry under reduced pressure . 4 . Weigh the fractions and dissolve in chloroform . 5 . For every 1 . 5 times of the product , add 1 mol mPEG - SH . Allow to react for 2 days at RT . 6 . Conﬁrm the reaction completion using TLC with silica gel plates and chloroform – methanol – water ( 65 : 25 : 4 ) as the eluent ( see Note 14 ) . 7 . Recrystallize the polymer using diethyl ether and dry under reduced pressure . Recrystallization involves pouring hot sol - vent over the impure substance , enough to just about dissolve the solute and the impurities . The solution is then cooled under air ﬁrst and ice water next , to start the process of recrys - tallization . The pure polymer thus obtained is puriﬁed by vacuum ﬁltration . For the preparation of liposomes , use the methods described in Subheading 3 . 1 , optimizing for the amount of redox sensitive PEG . Optimization parameters includes optimal size distribution and stability of liposomes . 3 . 9 Synthesis of MMP2 - Sensitive PEG - Lipid Conjugate 1 .

After the reaction and puriﬁcation process , peaks of the peptide ( Retention Time ¼ ~ 9 . 0 min ) and MAL - PEG ( 3400 ) – NHS ( Retention Time ¼ ~ 11 min ) will completely disappear while a new peak of MAL - PEG ( 3400 ) – peptide will be detected ( Retention time ¼ ~ 12 . 1 min ) . This change indicates the com - pletion of the product puriﬁcation . 4 . Freeze - dry the product for the next step . 3 . 10 Synthesis of an MMP2 - Sensitive PEG3400 - Lipid Conjugate 1 . Activate the MAL - PEG ( 3400 ) – peptide conjugate with a 20 - fold molar excess of N - hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) – 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) ( 1 : 1 molar ratio ) in an anhydrous chloroform – methanol mixture ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) for 2 h . 2 .

In a round - bottom ﬂask , prepare a mixture of the desired lipids dissolved in an organic such as chloroform or a mixture of chloroform and methanol 2 : 1 v / v . Add the hydrophobic drugs at this stage . Hydrophobic drugs will dissolve along with the lipids in the organic solvent . This makes it easier to incorporate them into the bilayer upon the evaporation of the organic solvent and addition of the aqueous dispersion medium . 2 . Using an aqueous dispersion of the magnetic nanoparticles in a buffer or 0 . 9 % ( w / v ) saline , rehydrate the lipid ﬁlm . Add the hydrophilic drug at this stage . Optimize for the quantity of iron oxide to be added . Too much iron oxide will interfere with the extrusion . Multiple studies report a wide range of values [ 51 – 53 ] . A wide range of toxicity studies have also been per - formed and can be used as reference while deciding on the concentration ( see Note 16 ) . 3 . Agitate the dispersion mechanically to detach the ﬁlm from the ﬂask . Heat the dispersion to a temperature slightly above the transition temperature of the lipids . 4 . Using a handheld extruder , pass the dispersion through poly - carbonate ﬁlters of decreasing pore sizes ( from 400 to 200 nm ) . This results in the formation of unilamellar magnetic liposomes . 5 . Centrifuge for 15 min at 1000 (cid:3) g to separate the iron - oxide encapsulated liposomes ( supernatant ) from the un - encapsulated iron oxide . 6 . Store the liposomes at 4 (cid:2) C till further use . 3 . 14 Preparation of a TAT - PEG - PE Conjugate 1 .

Remove the organic solvent using the rotary evaporator or drying under nitrogen , and freeze for a few hours . 4 . Using dialysis ( MWCO 2 , 000 ) , remove the unreacted TAT - Cys . Analyze each fraction using thin layer chromatography on silica plates ( mobile phase chloroform – methanol 80 : 20 % v / v ) . Visualize the conjugate with Dragendorff agent and phospho - molybdenic acid ( see Note 17 ) . 5 .

Vortex well to detach the ﬁlm . 3 . Heat in a water bath , to a temperature higher than the Tm ( phase transition temperature ) of the lipids for 3 min . 4 . Add a solution of [ 18 F ] - 2 - ﬂuoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose in saline ( up to 2 ml ) and freeze thaw for three cycles using liquid nitrogen . 5 . Extrude the solution through polycarbonate membrane ﬁlters with decreasing cut off sizes from 400 to 100 nm . Optimize for a uniform size distribution . 6 . Centrifuge the resulting liposomes at 180 , 000 (cid:3) g for 15 min ( after dilution with saline ) to remove the untrapped [ 18 F ] - 2 - ﬂuoro - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose . 7 . Resuspend in an isotonic buffer of choice . 3 . 16 Interaction of Multifunctional Liposomes with Cancer Cells 1 . Grow cancer cells on coverslips in 24 - well culture plates at the density of 1 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / well . 2 . When the cells reach 60 – 70 % of conﬂuence , wash the cells twice with pH 7 . 4 PBS and treat the cells with a ﬂuorescent dye such as Rhodamine coupled with a phospholipid group ( Rh - PE ) labeled liposomes in serum containing media . For pH - sensitive liposomes , pre - incubate samples at pH 5 . 0 to cleave the pH - sensitive PEG conjugate . In the case of MMP2 - sensitive liposomes , pre - incubate samples with 5 ng / μ L of human MMP2 overnight , at 37 (cid:2) C to “deshield” the liposomes from the PEG chains or use cells which overexpress MMP2 in the culture media , such as HT1080 cells , a ﬁbrosarcoma cell line [ 54 ] . 3 . After ﬁxed incubation times , add Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain ( 2 . 5 μ g / ml ) for 30 min at room temperature . 4 . Remove the cell culture medium and wash the cells at least three times with phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 4 . 5 . Mount coverslips cell - side down on glass slides using ﬂuores - cence - free glycerol - based mounting medium ( Fluoromount - G ) , visualize with a confocal microscope system and analyze using an image browser software . 3 . 17 Evaluation of the In Vivo Tumor Internalization of Stimuli - Sensitive - Based Nanopreparations The therapeutic activity of different anticancer drugs incorporated in multifunctional liposomes can be evaluated in mouse xenograft models . A typical example is demonstrated here . 1 . Grow the required tumor cell line in a ﬂask . Detach and count the cells . 56 Bhawani Aryasomayajula et al . 2 . Inject a known number of cells into the left or right ﬂank of immunodeﬁcient mice . 3 . When the tumors reach a size in the range of 100 – 200 mm 3 , inject 100 – 200 μ l of liposome suspensions in phosphate buffer i . v . via the tail vein at different time points . For FACS studies , inject Rh - labeled liposomes . 4 . At the end of the study ( approximately 2 h for FACS and confocal studies and a few weeks for tumor regression studies ) , anesthetize the mice , sacriﬁce them by cervical dislocation , excise the tumors to evaluate the tumor weight and cryoﬁx them for further biological examination ( see Notes 18 and 19 ) . 4 Notes 1 . A typical liposome comprises of a mixture of neutral phospho - lipids such as phosphatidyl cholines and phosphatidyl ethano - lamines along with a certain amount of cholesterol , which imparts ﬂuidity to the bilayer . The amount of cholesterol is optimized to impart stability to the liposome without destroy - ing the stability of the bilayer . In some cases , positively or negatively charged lipids are also added to the mixture . For this example we use a mixture of EPC ( egg L - α - phosphatidyl - choline ) and cholesterol in the molar ratios 70 : 30 . 2 . Storage of lipids : The lipids should be stored in an amber glass vial with a Teﬂon lined cap under an inert gas at (cid:4) 20 (cid:2) C (cid:5) 4 (cid:2) C . Saturated lipids can be stored as powders , but unsaturated lipids should be stored as solutions in an organic solvent . 3 . Only high quality borosilicate glass tubes or ﬂasks must be used . Care should be taken to wash the glassware multiple times with detergent , and subsequently with chloroform or methanol . The glassware should be dried thoroughly to get rid of contaminants that may cause oxidation of the lipids . 4 . Keep the ﬂask in an ice bath while using the probe sonicator . 5 . Ice cold water can be used in a bath sonicator . Alternatively , while using a probe sonicator , the glass ﬂask should be con - stantly in an ice bath . 6 . Bubbles will interfere with the formation of a smooth ﬁlm . 7 . Optimize the quantity of PEG to prevent aggregation . Values can range from 0 . 5 to 5 % depending on the ligands attached to the PEG chain . 8 . PNP - PEG 3400 - PNP ( polyoxyethylene ( MW 3400 ) - bis ( p - nitro - phenyl carbonate ) is a homobifunctional PEG moiety with a reactive nitrophenyl carbonate group at both ends . This makes the crosslinking agent especially valuable for the conjugation of Multifunctional Liposomes 57 a variety of ligands at one end and the incorporation of a PE group at the other , for insertion into liposomes . 9 . Monitor reaction with TLC ( Silica Gel 60 F 254 ) . Use 80 : 20 CHCl 3 – MeOH as the mobile phase . Use UV light for general visualization . For speciﬁc visualization , use Dragendorff reagent for PEG spots , molybdenum blue for PE spots ( phos - phorous derivative ) and ninhydrin reagent for primary amine spots . Compare reaction spots with standards to detect total elimination of PE spot from reaction sample and appearance of combined PEG / PE spot . 10 . Biocinchonic assay measures the total protein content in the formulation by using the peptide bonds present in the formu - lation to reduce cupric ions to cuprous ions , which are detect - able using colorimetry . This can quantitatively detect the amount of 2C5 present in the conjugate . 11 . Conﬁrm the post insertion and immunological activity using an ELISA for 2C5 . 12 . Freeze - thawing is another example of a technique to synthesize liposomes with high encapsulation efﬁciency . This technique is often employed for synthesizing liposomes containing a mix - ture of phosphatidyl cholines with anionic or cationic lipids . 13 . If there is another moiety such as a targeting agent , e . g . , 2C5 , or a Cell Penetrating Peptide , e . g . , TAT ( derived from the transactivator of transcription of the human immunodeﬁciency virus ) involved , use a PEG chain of a greater length to provide a shielding effect . Here we have shown the use of PEG2000 . 14 . The DOPE will upon reaction with SPDP , convert to a faster running product , PDP - DOPE , which can be detected using molybdenum blue . 15 . Monitor the reaction by using TLC followed by the Molybde - num Blue Spray Reagent staining to detect the phospholipid moiety . The conjugation of MAL - PEG ( 3400 ) - peptide with DOPE delays its migration compared to free DOPE in the TLC plate stained by Molybdenum Blue Spray Reagent . 16 . Optimize for the quantity of iron oxide to be added . This is done by trial and error , to ensure easy extrusion . 17 . Visualize the conjugate with Dragendorff agent and phospho - molybdenic acid for the detection of PEG chains and lipids , respectively . 18 . To follow liposome - to - cell interactions , Rh - PE ( 0 . 5 % mol ) can be added to the liposomal formulations . 19 . For confocal analysis , frozen sections ( 6 μ m ) are cut on a Cryostats microtome , placed on glass slides and stained by Hoechst 33342 for nuclei visualization . The presence of 58 Bhawani Aryasomayajula et al . Rh - labeled liposomes in the tumor tissues is analyzed by con - focal microscopy . The slides will be visualized by light micros - copy at 40 (cid:3) magniﬁcation . For FACS analysis , Rh - labeled liposomes are injected iv in tumor - bearing mice . At 2 h after injection , and fresh tumor tissues will be minced into small pieces and incubated in 400 U / ml collagenase D solution for 30 min at 37 (cid:2) C to dissociate cells . The single - cell suspension is analyzed immediately by FACS . References 1 . Torchilin VP ( 2005 ) Recent advances with liposomes as pharmaceutical carriers .

Russ Algar Abstract Proteolysis has many important roles in physiological regulation . It is involved in numerous cell signaling processes and the pathogenesis of many diseases , including cancers . Methods of visualizing and assaying proteolytic activity are therefore in demand . Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) probes offer several advantages in this respect . FRET supports end - point or real - time measurements , does not require washing or separation steps , and can be implemented in various assay or imaging formats . In this chapter , we describe methodology for preparing self - assembled concentric FRET ( cFRET ) probes for multiplexed tracking and imaging of proteolytic activity . The cFRET probe comprises a green - emitting semiconductor quantum dot ( QD ) conjugated with multiple copies of two different peptide substrates for two target proteases . The peptide substrates are labeled with different ﬂuorescent dyes , Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 647 , and FRET occurs between the QD and both dyes , as well as between the two dyes . This design enables a single QD probe to track the activity of two proteases simultaneously . Fundamental cFRET theory is presented , and procedures for using the cFRET probe for quantitative measurement of the activity of two model proteases are given , including calibration , ﬂuorescence plate reader or microscope imaging assays , and data analysis . Sufﬁcient detail is provided for other researchers to adapt this method to their speciﬁc requirements and proteolytic systems of interest .

Their activity is important in numerous physiological processes and the pathogen - esis of diseases [ 1 – 4 ] . For example , numerous proteases and their cascaded activation are involved in cellular processes that are asso - ciated with the growth and progression of cancer [ 5 ] . One group of proteases associated with cancers is the caspases , which are members of the cysteine protease family . These proteases are the key effectors of apoptosis ( i . e . , programmed cell death ) and their activation is often inhibited in tumorigenesis [ 6 , 7 ] . Another relevant group of Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 4 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 63 proteases is the matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , which are mem - bers of the zinc - dependent metalloprotease family . The activity of MMPs in the extracellular matrix is important in cancer cell invasion and metastasis , and MMPs can affect signaling pathways , including the induction of apoptosis [ 8 , 9 ] . Other proteases implicated in cancer include cathepsin B ( a cysteine protease ) and urokinase - type plasminogen activator ( a serine protease ) , among many others [ 5 , 10 , 11 ] . Given the foregoing , it is not surprising that proteases are targets of both assay and imaging methods [ 12 , 13 ] , as well as therapeutics [ 14 – 16 ] . While many of the assay and imaging probes developed for protease activity utilize traditional materials such as ﬂuorescent dyes and ﬂuorescent proteins , often in combination with Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) [ 17 – 19 ] , there has been substantial and growing interest in utilizing nanomaterials and their unique properties for protease detection [ 20 , 21 ] . 1 . 2 Quantum Dots Quantum dots ( QDs ) are among the most proliﬁc nanomaterials for biological applications . These colloidal semiconductor nano - crystals are less than 10 nm in diameter and exhibit bright photo - luminescence ( PL ; see Note 1 ) as a result of a nanoscale phenomenon called quantum conﬁnement [ 22 ] . This PL is in many ways superior to the ﬂuorescence exhibited by molecular dyes and ﬂuorescent proteins [ 23 ] , and QDs thus offer several advantages when substituted for ﬂuorescent dyes and proteins in biological applications [ 22 ] . The combination of the optical and physical properties of QDs can also enable new methods that are not possible with molecular dyes and ﬂuorescent proteins alone . The most common QD materials are CdSe / ZnS core / shell nanocrystals . These QDs exhibit visible PL that can be tuned from blue ( ~ 450 nm ) through red ( ~ 650 nm ) as the core nano - crystal size is varied from ~ 2 to 7 nm in diameter [ 22 ] . Related CdSe 1 (cid:1) x S x / ZnS alloyed core / shell QDs have PL that can be tuned over a similar wavelength range through control of the core semi - conductor composition . QD PL is more spectrally narrow and symmetric ( 25 – 35 nm full - width - at - half - maximum ) than the ﬂuo - rescence from molecular dyes , and light absorption by QDs is more spectrally broad ( extending over a 200 – 400 nm range ) and stron - ger ( molar absorption coefﬁcients , ~ 10 4 – 10 7 M – 1 cm – 1 ) than that of molecular dyes [ 22 , 23 ] . QDs are frequently 10 – 100 - fold brighter than ﬂuorescent dyes and proteins , and are also more resistant to photobleaching [ 22 , 23 ] . A physical property of QDs that is leveraged with their optical properties is their nontrivial surface area , which supports both chemical and biological functio - nalization , the latter including multivalent conjugates with pep - tides , nucleic acids , antibodies , and other biomolecules [ 24 ] . High - quality QD - bioconjugates have been found to be relatively nontoxic in cultured cells and animal models [ 25 – 27 ] , and a multi - tude of biological assay and imaging applications for QDs have 64 Melissa Massey et al . been reported in the literature [ 28 – 30 ] . Some of the most exciting of these applications utilize QDs in combination with FRET [ 31 – 33 ] , including the multifunctional concentric FRET probes for proteolytic activity that are described in this chapter . 1 . 3 Fo¨rster Resonance Energy Transfer FRET can modulate QD PL ‘on’ and ‘off’ , and probes that operate on this principle have been developed for assaying many different proteases [ 20 ] . Basic QD - FRET probes for protease activity are the progenitors to the concentric FRET probes described in this chapter . FRET is a nonradiative energy transfer process that occurs between an excited - state donor and a ground - state acceptor [ 34 , 35 ] . The excitation energy of the donor ( D ) is transferred to the acceptor ( A ) through resonant interactions between the transi - tion dipoles associated with donor relaxation and acceptor excita - tion . FRET decreases the PL intensity and lifetime of the donor , and increases the PL intensity of a ﬂuorescent acceptor . The Fo¨rster formalism describes FRET quantitatively and can be summarized by Eqs . 1 – 3 [ 34 ] : k FRET ¼ 1 τ D R 0 r (cid:1) (cid:3) 6 ¼ k D R 0 r (cid:1) (cid:3) 6 ð 1 Þ R 60 ¼ 8 : 79 (cid:3) 10 (cid:1) 28 mol (cid:4) (cid:5) n (cid:1) 4 Φ D κ 2 J ð 2 Þ J ¼ ð I D λ ð Þ ε A λ ð Þ λ 4 d λ ð I D λ ð Þ d λ ð 3 Þ Equation 1 is the rate of energy transfer , k FRET , where τ D ¼ k D – 1 is the excited state lifetime of the donor , r is the donor - acceptor separation distance , and R 0 is the Fo¨rster distance . Equation 2 is used to calculate R 0 ( in units of cm ) , where n is the refractive index of the medium , Φ D is the donor quantum yield , κ 2 is the orientation factor , and J is the spectral overlap integral . The overlap integral is calculated from Eq . 3 , where I D ( λ ) is the wavelength - dependent donor emission intensity , ε A ( λ ) is the wavelength - dependent molar absorption coefﬁcient of the acceptor , and λ is the wavelength . The terms in these equations can be calculated with data from experi - mental measurements , including the absorption spectrum of the acceptor , and the emission spectrum , quantum yield , and lifetime of the donor ( see Notes 2 – 4 ) . The efﬁciency of FRET , E , is given by Eq . 4 , and can be measured experimentally through changes in the emission intensity or lifetime of the donor as per Eq . 5 , where I D ( or τ D ) and I DA ( or τ DA ) are the intensity ( or lifetime ) of the donor in the absence and presence of acceptor ( s ) , respectively [ 34 ] . If the donor and acceptor Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 65 quantum yields , Φ D and Φ A , are known , then the acceptor / donor PL intensity ratio , I AD / I DA , can be related to the FRET efﬁciency using Eq . 6 . E ¼ k FRET k D þ k FRET ¼ R 60 r 6 þ R 60 ð 4 Þ E ¼ 1 (cid:1) I DA = I D ð Þ ¼ 1 (cid:1) τ DA = τ D ð Þ ð 5 Þ I AD I DA ¼ Φ A E Φ D 1 (cid:1) E ð Þ ¼ Φ A Φ D R 0 r (cid:1) (cid:3) 6 ð 6 Þ The properties of QDs make them ideal for FRET , and energy transfer with these materials is consistent with the Fo¨rster formal - ism [ 32 , 33 ] . Although there are some examples with QDs as FRET acceptors , the majority of applications utilize QDs as donors with ﬂuorescent dye or ﬂuorescent protein acceptors [ 32 , 33 ] . The ability to use a QD donor as a scaffold to array multiple acceptors is one of the many advantages that QDs have over conventional ﬂuorescent dye and protein donors . When there are multiple accep - tors per QD donor , Eqs . 1 , 4 , and 6 are modiﬁed to Eqs . 7 , 8 , and 9 , where a is the number of equivalent acceptors . Tuning of both QD PL properties and the number of acceptors per QD offers a level of control over FRET that is not possible with other materials . k FRET ¼ a τ D R 0 r (cid:1) (cid:3) 6 ð 7 Þ E ¼ ak FRET k D þ ak FRET ¼ aR 60 r 6 þ aR 60 ð 8 Þ I AD I DA ¼ a Φ A Φ D (cid:1) (cid:3) R 0 r (cid:1) (cid:3) 6 ð 9 Þ QD - FRET probes for proteolytic activity attach multiple copies of an acceptor dye to a QD donor through peptide linkers that are substrates for a target protease . Changes in the number of acceptors per QD with hydrolysis of the peptide linkers results in changes in FRET that can be tracked through recovery of QD PL , loss of FRET - sensitized acceptor PL , or the ratio of these signals . 1 . 4 Concentric FRET Concentric FRET ( cFRET ) is a multifunctional extension of con - ventional FRET that has been enabled by the surface area and optical properties of QDs . Rather than arraying multiple copies of one acceptor per QD donor , multiple copies of two or more types of acceptor are arrayed , as shown in Fig . 1a . The “concentric” terminology refers to the position of these acceptors on the surface of an imaginary sphere larger in diameter and concentric with the QD . A cFRET conﬁguration with a QD donor and two types of 66 Melissa Massey et al . ﬂuorescent dye acceptor has multiple energy transfer pathways to consider . These pathways include energy transfer from the QD to the ﬁrst type of dye acceptor ( A1 ) , from the QD to the second type of dye acceptor ( A2 ) , and between the two types of dye acceptor , where A1 serves as a donor for A2 [ 36 ] . The ﬂowchart in Fig . 1b shows how these pathways compete with and follow one another , as well as the intrinsic luminescent and nonluminescent relaxation pathways of each emitter . In a cFRET conﬁguration , the QD PL intensity , I QD , is quenched as a result of FRET to both A1 and A2 . The quenching efﬁciency , Q QD , is given by Eq . 10 where M and N represent the number of A1 and A2 per QD , k QD is equivalent to k D in Eq . 4 , and k QD - A1 and k QD - A2 are FRET rates analogous to k FRET in Eq . 1 [ 36 ] .

" # ð 13 Þ The rate terms , k QD – 1 k QD - A x , in Eqs . 10 – 13 can be determined from experiments with nonconcentric QD - A1 and QD - A2 FRET systems , and the k A1 – 1 k A1 - A2 term can be determined from direct excitation of A1 in a cFRET conﬁguration [ 36 ] . Prediction of the QD quenching ( Eq . 10 ) is more robust than prediction of the emission ratios ( Eqs . 12 and 13 ) , although the latter remain useful ﬁrst approximations . Overall , these equations are helpful in design - ing and optimizing cFRET probes , but they are not strictly required for the practical application of cFRET probes . 1 . 5 Tracking Proteolytic Activity with Concentric FRET We have used cFRET conﬁgurations to quantitatively track the activation of pro - chymotrypsin to chymotrypsin by trypsin [ 38 ] , to image spatially heterogeneous trypsin and chymotrypsin activ - ities [ 39 ] , and to simultaneously measure both the activity and concentration of thrombin [ 40 ] . These studies , and the methods outlined in this chapter , utilized a prototypical cFRET conﬁgura - tion with a green - emitting QD donor and multiple copies of both an Alexa Fluor 555 ( A555 ) - labeled peptide and an Alexa Fluor 647 ( A647 ) - labeled peptide conjugated to the QD . FRET occurs from the QD to the A555 , to a lesser extent from the QD to the A647 , and from the A555 to the A647 [ 36 ] . The A555 and A647 are thus equivalent to A1 and A2 in the equations in Subheading 1 . 4 . Proteolysis is tracked through changes in the A555 / QD and A647 / QD PL ratios as the peptides are hydrolyzed by their respec - tive proteases and the number of each dye acceptor per QD changes . This chapter describes how to use this prototypical cFRET conﬁguration for assaying and imaging the activity of two proteases . Detailed procedures for empirical calibration of cFRET PL ratios , assays , and data analysis are presented using trypsin and 68 Melissa Massey et al . chymotrypsin as widely accessible model proteases . Subheading 4 provides additional tips and information that enable the methodol - ogy to be extended to other proteases of interest and different experimental formats . 2 Materials 2 . 1 Reagents 1 . Hydrophilic ( i . e . , water - soluble ) , ligand - coated QDs with green PL centered between 520 and 525 nm ( see Notes 6 – 9 ) .

Clear , UV - transparent , ﬂat - bottom 96 - well microtiter plates ( for microscope imaging ; see Note 15 ) . 4 . Fluorescence plate reader ( for microtiter plate assays ) . We use an Inﬁnite M1000 Pro plate reader ( Tecan US , Inc . , Morris - ville , NC , USA ) . The main requirements are that the ﬂuores - cence plate reader is able to provide excitation at ~ 400 nm and measure three different emission wavelengths ( ~ 520 nm , ~ 570 nm , and ~ 650 nm ) with bandwidths of ~ 5 nm or less . For real - time measurements , the plate reader should be able to make these measurements in an automated and repetitive fash - ion . Other plate reader instruments may also be suitable ( see Note 16 ) . 5 . Fluorescence microscope ( for imaging assays ) . We use an IX83 Inverted Microscope ( Olympus , Richmond Hill , ON , Canada ) equipped with a broad spectrum metal - halide light source ( X - Cite 120XL , Excelitas Technologies , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) , a 405 / 20 ( center line / bandwidth in nm ) excitation ﬁlter ( Chroma Technology Corp . , Bellow Falls , VT , USA ) , either a 425 nm - cutoff or 470 nm - cutoff dichroic mirror ( Chroma ) , a 4 . 0 (cid:3) / 0 . 16NA objective lens , a motorized emis - sion ﬁlter wheel ( Olympus ) with 520 / 40 , 565 / 30 , and 665 nm longpass ( LP ) ﬁlters ( Chroma ) , and a sCMOS camera ( Orca - Flash 4 . 0 V2 , C11440 ; Hamamatsu Photonics , Hama - matsu , SZK , Japan ) . Our microscope is operated with Meta - Fluor software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . Other microscope systems and speciﬁcations may also be suit - able ( see Note 17 ) . 6 . Other instruments capable of PL measurements may also be substituted for the plate reader and microscope systems noted above ( see Note 18 ) . 7 . Image processing software .

Data analysis software capable of ﬁtting data to custom mathe - matical functions and mixed global and local ﬁtting ( see Note 19 ) . We use pro Fit ( QuantumSoft , Uetikon am See , Switzer - land ) and / or MatLab ( MathWorks , Natick , MA , USA ) . 70 Melissa Massey et al . 3 Methods 3 . 1 Calibration Samples To calibrate the cFRET system , a series of QD - [ Peptide1 ( A1 ) ] M - [ Peptide2 ( A2 ) ] N samples with different values of M and N are required . For the prototypical cFRET conﬁguration with chymo - trypsin and trypsin as model proteases , the conﬁgurations are QD - [ Sub ChT ( A555 ) ] M - [ Sub TRP ( A647 ) ] N . The procedure described below is a simple empirical calibration procedure that assumes negligible nonspeciﬁc adsorption of hydrolyzed peptide fragments on the QD ( see Note 20 for an alternative calibration strategy that does not make this assumption ) . The quantities are intended for preparation of samples with 100 μ L volumes and 0 . 10 μ M concen - tration for use in a 96 - well microtiter plate . The quantities can be scaled to accommodate other measurement formats ( see Note 21 ) . 1 . Obtain stock solutions of Sub ChT ( A555 ) and Sub TRP ( A647 ) . The product of the volume ( μ L ) and concentration ( μ M ) of the solutions should be greater than 3800 pmol for Sub ChT ( A555 ) and 4350 pmol for Sub TRP ( A647 ) , with minimum concentra - tions of 8 . 0 μ M . These amounts will be sufﬁcient for calibration samples and 12 samples for enzyme assays ( see Note 22 ) . 2 . Prepare 400 and 900 μ L substock solutions of 1 . 0 and 2 . 0 μ M Sub ChT ( A555 ) in BB2 in 1 . 7 mL microcentrifuge tubes ( see Note 22 ) . 3 . Prepare 150 , 350 , and 425 μ L substock solutions of 1 . 0 , 2 . 0 , and 4 . 0 μ M Sub TRP ( A647 ) in BB2 in 1 . 7 mL microcentrifuge tubes ( see Note 22 ) . 4 . Obtain a stock solution of QDs . The product of the volume ( μ L ) and concentration ( μ M ) of the solution should be greater than 560 pmol with a minimum concentration of 1 . 0 μ M . This amount will be sufﬁcient for the calibration samples and 12 samples for enzyme assays . 5 . Prepare a 800 μ L substock solution of 0 . 50 μ M QD in BB2 in a 1 . 7 mL microcentrifuge tube ( see Note 22 ) . 6 . Set up an array of microcentrifuge tubes with six rows and six columns in a microcentrifuge tube rack . These tubes will hold the 36 samples speciﬁed in Fig . 2 . An additional 12 samples may be warranted if utilizing a cFRET conﬁguration different from the prototypical QD - ( A555 ) M - ( A647 ) N conﬁguration or utilizing an instrument or settings different from those speci - ﬁed ( see Note 23 ) . 7 . Add M equivalents of Sub ChT ( A555 ) to each sample tube as speciﬁed in Fig . 2 ( see Note 24 ) . 8 . Add N equivalents of Sub TRP ( A647 ) to each sample tube as speciﬁed in Fig . 2 ( see Note 24 ) . Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 71 9 . Add BB2 to each sample tube as speciﬁed in Fig . 2 . All solu - tions will have the same total volume at this step . 10 . Add 20 μ L of the 0 . 50 μ M QD substock solution to each sample tube as speciﬁed in Fig . 2 ( see Note 24 ) . Mix each sample after adding the QD . The ﬁnal volume of each sample is 100 μ L . Each sample has 10 pmol of QD at a concentration of 0 . 10 μ M with M and N equivalents of Sub ChT ( A555 ) and Sub TRP ( A647 ) . 11 . Incubate the samples at room temperature for 2 h and protect from light ( see Note 25 ) . Fig . 2 Example of a calibration sample preparation matrix with 36 different ( M , N ) combinations . Suggested concentrations of Sub ChT ( A555 ) and Sub TRP ( A647 ) substock solutions are indicated . The concentration of the QD substock solution is 0 . 5 μ M . The value of M varies across the matrix rows and the value of N varies down the matrix columns . The volume ( μ L ) of each solution to add per calibration sample is indicated in each box 72 Melissa Massey et al . 12 . Proceed to Subheading 3 . 2 for plate reader measurement of the calibration samples . Alternatively , proceed to Subhead - ing 3 . 3 for microscope imaging of the calibration samples . 3 . 2 Plate Reader Calibration 1 . Set the plate reader to an excitation wavelength of ~ 400 nm . This wavelength minimizes direct excitation of the A555 and A647 ( see Note 26 ) . 2 . Load a black , ﬂat - bottom 96 - well microtiter plate with the calibration samples prepared in Subheading 3 . 1 and at least one buffer blank . 3 . Use the plate reader to measure either the complete emission spectrum of each sample or , alternatively , to measure the emis - sion intensities at only 520 , 570 , and 670 nm ( see Notes 27 and 28 ) . 4 . Proceed to Subheading 3 . 4 ( optional ) or Subheading 3 . 5 . 3 . 3 Microscope Imaging Calibration 1 . Set the microscope excitation ﬁlter to 405 / 20 . This wave - length range minimizes direct excitation of the A555 and A647 ( see Note 26 ) . 2 . Set the microscope dichroic mirror to a 425 nm - or 470 nm - cutoff . 3 . Load a clear , UV - transparent , ﬂat - bottom 96 - well microtiter plate with the calibration samples prepared in Subheading 3 . 1 and at least one buffer blank . 4 . Position the microtiter plate on the microscope stage so that a single sample well or group of sample wells is centered in the ﬁeld of view . 5 . Acquire PL images of the calibration samples with 520 / 40 , 565 / 30 , and 665LP ﬁlters ( see Notes 29 and 30 ) . 6 . Repeat steps 4 and 5 for any remaining sample wells . 7 . Proceed to Subheading 3 . 4 ( optional ) or Subheading 3 . 5 . 3 . 4 Conﬁrmation of Peptide Binding to QDs Agarose gel electrophoresis is used to conﬁrm binding of dye - labeled peptides to the QDs . This step may be considered optional ( proceed to Subheading 3 . 5 if skipping this step ) but is good practice for quality control . Aliquots from the samples prepared and measured in Subheading 3 . 1 can be utilized ( see Note 31 ) . Gel electrophoresis can also be used to estimate the peptide loading capacity of the QDs ( i . e . , maximum average number of peptides per QD ; see Note 32 ) . 1 . Prepare a 1 . 0 % w / v agarose gel with 1 (cid:3) TBE buffer . 2 . Mix selected sample aliquots ( 20 μ L ) with 5 μ L of 50 % v / v aqueous glycerol ( see Note 33 ) . Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 73 3 . Load between 10 and 20 μ L of the samples into the wells of the agarose gel . Use a consistent volume between wells . 4 . Run the gel at a ﬁeld strength of ~ 7 – 8 V / cm for ~ 25 – 35 min ( see Note 34 ) . Glutathione ( GSH ) - coated QDs are negatively charged and therefore migrate toward the anode ( positive elec - trode ) . The self - assembly of peptides generally adds size to the QD without adding signiﬁcant net charge . QDs with a greater number of peptides assembled will thus have a decreased elec - trophoretic mobility and will travel at a slower rate through the gel ( see Note 35 ) . 5 . Image the gel using PL ( see Note 36 ) . A representative example of a gel is shown in Fig . 3 . 3 . 5 Data Analysis of Calibration Samples If analyzing plate reader data ( from Subheading 3 . 2 ) , proceed to Subheading 3 . 5 . 1 to correct this data for crosstalk and to calculate PL ratios . If analyzing imaging data ( from Subheading 3 . 3 ) , it is likely that regions of interest ( ROIs ) will need to be deﬁned before proceeding to Subheading 3 . 5 . 1 . Most image analysis programs support the deﬁnition and analysis of multiple ROIs within or between images and image stacks . For time - lapse imaging , we use Image J to import a stack of images for each channel ( QD520 , A555 , and A647 , where each image in a stack is taken at a speciﬁc time point ) , deﬁne common ROIs between each stack , and calcu - late average PL intensities for each ROI . Once the data has been extracted from ROIs , it can be corrected for crosstalk and the PL ratios can be calculated . Fig . 3 Example of a 1 . 0 % w / v agarose gel to conﬁrm the self - assembly of polyhistidine - terminated peptides to QDs . The glutathione - coated QDs migrate toward the anode and their electrophoretic mobility decreases as peptides are assembled . Adapted with permission from ref . 36 .

Background correct all data by subtracting the appropriate value ( s ) from the buffer blank ( s ) or suitable ROIs of images ( see Note 37 ) . 2 . For all ( M , N ) calibration samples , record the PL intensity at 520 nm ( plate reader ) or with the 520 / 40 bandpass ﬁlter ( microscope ) as I 520 . The QD PL is not subject to signiﬁcant crosstalk from the A555 or A647 PL ( see Note 38 ) and there - fore Eq . 14 applies , where I QD is the QD emission intensity . I QD M ; N ð Þ ¼ I 520 M ; N ð Þ ð 14 Þ 3 . For the ( M , N ) ¼ ( 0 , 0 ) calibration sample ( i . e . , QD only ) , record the PL intensity at 570 nm ( plate reader ) or with the 565 / 30 ﬁlter ( microscope ) as I 570 . For the ( 0 , 0 ) sample , this value represents the crosstalk from the QD when attempting to measure the A555 PL intensity . Calculate the crosstalk coefﬁ - cient , A555 σ QD , according to Eq . 15 . A555 σ QD ¼ I 570 0 ; 0 ð Þ I QD 0 ; 0 ð Þ ð 15 Þ 4 . For the ( 0 , 0 ) calibration sample , record the PL intensity at 670 nm ( plate reader ) or with the 665LP ﬁlter ( microscope ) as I 670 . This value represents the crosstalk from the QD when attempting to measure the A647 PL intensity . Calculate the crosstalk coefﬁcient , A647 σ QD , according to Eq . 16 . A647 σ QD ¼ I 670 0 ; 0 ð Þ I QD 0 ; 0 ð Þ ð 16 Þ 5 . For all ( M , N ) calibration samples , record the PL intensity at 570 nm ( plate reader ) or with the 565 / 30 ﬁlter ( microscope ) as I 570 . Convert this value to the A555 PL intensity , I A555 , using the A555 σ QD crosstalk correction coefﬁcient using Eq . 17 . I A555 M ; N ð Þ ¼ I 570 M ; N ð Þ(cid:1) A555 σ QD I QD M ; N ð Þ ð 17 Þ 6 . For the ( M > 0 , 0 ) calibration samples , record the PL intensity at 670 nm ( plate reader ) or with the 665LP ﬁlter ( microscope ) as I 670 . This value represents the crosstalk from both the QD and A555 when attempting to measure the A647 PL . Correct this value for the QD crosstalk using Eq . 18 and the A647 σ QD crosstalk coefﬁcient . The new value is A647 σ A555 I A555 , which is the crosstalk from only the A555 when attempting to measure the A647 PL . A647 σ A555 I A555 M ; 0 ð Þ ¼ I 670 M ; 0 ð Þ(cid:1) A647 σ QD I QD M ; 0 ð Þ ð 18 Þ Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 75 Calculate the crosstalk coefﬁcient , A647 σ A555 , according to Eq . 19 ( see Note 39 ) . Average the values of all ( M , 0 ) samples with sufﬁcient signal - to - noise ratios . A647 σ A555 ¼ I 670 M ; 0 ð Þ(cid:1) A647 σ QD I QD M ; 0 ð Þ I A 555 M ; 0 ð Þ ð 19 Þ 7 . For all ( M , N ) calibration samples , record the PL intensity at 670 nm ( plate reader ) or with the 665LP ﬁlter ( microscope ) as I 670 . Convert this value to the A647 PL intensity , I A647 , using the crosstalk correction coefﬁcients and Eq . 20 . I A647 M ; N ð Þ ¼ I 670 M ; N ð Þ(cid:1) A647 σ QD I QD M ; N ð Þ (cid:1) A647 σ A555 I A555 M ; N ð Þ ð 20 Þ 8 . For all ( M , N ) calibration samples , calculate the I A555 / I QD and I A647 / I QD PL ratios . 9 . We use one of two methods for analyzing the crosstalk - corrected PL ratio calibration data . If software capable of three - dimensional surface ﬁtting is available , then optionally proceed to Subheading 3 . 5 . 3 ( i . e . , ﬁtting data on a plot with x , y , and z axes ) . Otherwise , proceed to Subheading 3 . 5 . 2 for two - dimensional ﬁtting ( i . e . , ﬁtting data on a plot with x and y axes ) . 3 . 5 . 2 Two - Dimensional Fitting 1 . We use Excel or pro Fit software for this analysis . 2 . For a given value of N , plot the A555 / QD PL ratio on the y - axis versus the values of M on the x - axis . 3 . Repeat step 2 for the remaining values of N and plot the data on the same graph . A representative example of data is shown in Fig . 4a ( i ) . 4 . Identify the general function , f ( M ) , that will ﬁt each data subset ( i . e . , variable M for ﬁxed N ) . In our experience , a linear func - tion or a parabolic function is typically satisfactory ( see Note 40 ) . The data shown in Fig . 4a ( i ) can be ﬁt with quadratic functions of the type shown in Fig . 4a ( ii ) . 5 . Fit each data subset ( i . e . , variable M for ﬁxed N ) with the function from step 4 . Record the equations of ﬁt . The ﬁtting process may use only local variables ( i . e . , different values for each value of N ) or a combination of local and global ( i . e . , same value regardless of N ) variables . For the data in Fig . 4a ( i ) , a scaled quadratic equation is used where the b and c coefﬁcients are global variables and the a coefﬁcient is a local variable . The ﬁtted data is shown in Fig . 4a ( iii ) . 76 Melissa Massey et al . Fig . 4 An example of cFRET calibration data for QD520 - [ Sub ChT ( A555 ) ] M - [ Sub TRP ( A647 ) ] N samples and its ﬁve - step ( i – v ) analysis with coupled two - dimensional ﬁtting . Analysis of ( A ) the A555 / QD PL ratio and ( B ) A647 / QD PL ratio is separated until the ﬁnal step . Subheading 3 . 5 . 2 describes each step in detail . Data adapted from ref . 36 6 . For each locally ﬁt coefﬁcient in the ﬁtted functions from step 5 , plot the values of the coefﬁcient on the y - axis versus the values of N on the x - axis . For the ﬁtted data in Fig . 4a ( iii ) , the value of the a coefﬁcient is plotted versus N in Fig . 4a ( iv ) . 7 . For each coefﬁcient value plotted versus N , ﬁt the data with a satisfactory function ( see Note 41 ) . Record the function . For the data in Fig . 4a ( iv ) , the trend in the a coefﬁcient as a function of N is approximately linear . 8 . Substitute the function from step 7 into the general function from step 4 . The resulting calibration equation is the A555 / QD PL ratio as a function of M , N , and numerical coefﬁcients , as shown in Fig . 4a ( v ) . 9 . For a given value of M , plot the A647 / QD PL ratio on the y - axis versus the values of N on the x - axis of a new graph . 10 . Repeat step 9 for the remaining values of M and plot the data on the same graph . A representative example of data is shown in Fig . 4b ( i ) ( this data is from the same calibration experiment as the data in Fig . 4a ) . 11 . Identify the general function , f ( N ) , that will ﬁt each data subset ( i . e . , variable N for ﬁxed M ) . In our experience , a linear func - tion or a monoexponential rise - to - maximum function is typi - cally satisfactory ( see Note 40 ) . The data in Fig . 4b ( i ) can be ﬁt with monoexponential rise - to - maximum functions of the type shown in Fig . 4b ( ii ) . 12 . Fit each data subset ( i . e . , variable N for ﬁxed M ) with the function from step 11 . Record the equation of ﬁt . For the data in Fig . 4b ( i ) , an exponential rise - to - maximum equation is used where the a and b coefﬁcients are both local variables . The ﬁtted data is shown in Fig . 4b ( iii ) . 13 . For each locally ﬁt coefﬁcient in the ﬁtted functions from step 12 , plot the values of the coefﬁcient on the y - axis versus the values of M on the x - axis . For the ﬁtted data in Fig . 4b ( iii ) , the a and b coefﬁcients are plotted versus M . 14 . For each coefﬁcient value plotted versus M , ﬁt the data with a satisfactory function ( see Note 41 ) . Record the function . For the data in Fig . 4b ( iii ) , both the a and b coefﬁcients are qua - dratic functions of M in Fig . 4b ( iv ) . 15 . Substitute the function from step 14 into the general function from step 11 . The resulting calibration equation is the A647 / QD PL ratio as a function of M , N , and numerical coefﬁcients , as shown in Fig . 4b ( v ) . 16 . The two calibration equations of ﬁt obtained from steps 8 and 15 will enable back - calculation of M and N from PL ratios measured during enzyme assays . 78 Melissa Massey et al . 3 . 5 . 3 Three - Dimensional Fitting 1 . We use MatLab for this analysis . 2 . Plot the A555 / QD PL ratio on the z - axis with M and N on the x - axis and y - axis , respectively . 3 . Fit the data with a polynomial surface and record the equation of ﬁt , which is the A555 / QD PL ratio as a function of M , N , and numerical coefﬁcients . Figure 5a ( i ) shows the data from Fig . 4a , plotted in three dimensions and ﬁt with a polynomial surface that is third degree in M and third degree in N . 4 . Repeat steps 2 and 3 with the A647 / QD emission ratio on the z - axis instead . The resulting equation is the A647 / QD PL ratio as a function of M , N , and numerical coefﬁcients . Figure 5a ( ii ) shows the data from Fig . 4b , plotted in three dimensions and ﬁt with a polynomial surface that is third degree in M and third degree in N . 5 . The two calibration equations of ﬁt obtained from steps 2 and 3 will enable back - calculation of M and N from emission ratios measured during enzyme assays . Examples of equations are shown in Fig . 5a . Figure 5b shows the correlation between experimental PL ratios and the PL ratios calculated from the calibration equations of ﬁt derived in this section ( three - dimensional ﬁtting ) and Subheading 3 . 5 . 2 ( two - dimensional ﬁtting ) . 3 . 6 Enzyme Assays and Data Analysis Microtiter plate - based enzyme assays are carried out by ﬁrst prepar - ing a batch of cFRET probes and aliquoting the probes into a row of wells in a microtiter plate . To initiate the assays , protease solution is added to each of the wells . In the case of real - time assays , repeti - tive PL measurements are started immediately . For end - point assays , the samples are left to incubate for a deﬁned period of time prior to PL measurements . The following steps are sufﬁcient to assay 12 samples ( i . e . , one row of a 96 - well microtiter plate ; see Note 42 ) . For imaging assays , the same general procedure applies , but the quantities and other details will need to be adapted to the imaging format ( see Note 43 ) . 1 . Prepare or obtain a 200 μ L substock solution of 8 . 0 μ M Sub - ChT ( A555 ) in BB2 . Use the same stock solution used in Sub - heading 3 . 1 ( see Note 44 ) . 2 . Prepare or obtain a 225 μ L substock solution of 8 . 0 μ M Sub - TRP ( A647 ) in BB2 . Use the same stock solution used in Sub - heading 3 . 1 ( see Note 44 ) . 3 . Prepare or obtain a 150 μ L substock solution of 1 . 0 μ M QD in BB2 . Use the same stock solution used in Subheading 3 . 1 ( see Note 44 ) . 4 . Prepare a substock solution of cFRET probes with values of M and N within the range used for calibration experiments . If Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 79 using QD - [ Sub ChT ( A555 ) ] 10 - [ Sub TRP ( A647 ) ] 12 conjugates ( the highest values of M and N in the calibration samples ; see Note 45 ) and 96 - well microtiter plates ( see Note 43 ) , add 175 μ L of 8 . 0 μ M Sub ChT ( A555 ) , 210 μ L of 8 . 0 μ M Sub - TRP ( A647 ) , 175 μ L of BB2 , and , lastly , 140 μ L of 1 . 0 μ M QDs to a microcentrifuge tube . Mix immediately and let stand for Fig . 5 ( a ) The same cFRET calibration data shown in Fig . 4i but plotted in three dimensions instead of two dimensions . The data is ﬁt with the polynomial functions shown . ( b ) Plots showing the correlation between the calculated and experimental PL ratios . The calculated PL ratios were derived from the equations of best ﬁt for the calibration data . Correlations are shown for both two - dimensional ( 2D ) ﬁtting ( Fig . 4 ) and three - dimensional ( 3D ) ﬁtting ( panel a of this ﬁgure ) . A good correlation is indicated by slopes ( m ) that are very close to unity . Data adapted from ref . 36 80 Melissa Massey et al . 2 h . The cFRET probe solution will be diluted by a factor of 2 in a subsequent step . 5 . Prepare solutions of proteases to be assayed . The protease solution will be diluted by a factor of 2 in a subsequent step . 6 . Set up the plate reader or microscope with the same parameters and settings used for the calibration experiment ( see Subhead - ing 3 . 2 or 3 . 3 ) . 7 . Add 50 μ L of the QD - [ Sub ChT ( A555 ) ] 10 - [ Sub TRP ( A647 ) ] 12 cFRET probes from step 4 to each well in a row of a microtiter plate . 8 . Add 50 μ L of BB2 to at least one of the wells in step 7 as a negative control . 9 . Add 50 μ L of the desired protease solution ( s ) to the remaining wells from step 7 . 10 . For a real - time assay , begin making PL measurements immedi - ately after adding the last aliquot of enzyme . The time interval between measurements should be much longer than the time required for measurement of the PL intensities in the three wavelength channels . The time required for complete hydroly - sis should be much longer than the time interval between measurements . For end - point assays , incubate the samples for the desired period of time before making PL measurements in all three channels . 11 . Convert the raw emission data into crosstalk - corrected A555 / QD and A647 / QD PL ratios . If the data is from a real - time assay , perform this analysis at each time point . 12 . Using the two calibration equations from Subheading 3 . 5 . 2 or 3 . 5 . 1 , calculate the values of M and N from the measured A555 / QD and A647 / QD PL ratios . The two equations need to be solved simultaneously . In many cases , an analytic solution will be either inconvenient or impossible and a numer - ical method should be used ( see Note 46 ) . 13 . If using Excel for data analysis , rearrange the two calibration equations so that the left - hand side is equal to zero ( i . e . , subtract the PL ratio from both sides of the equation ) . Input the initial values for M and N ( from step 4 ) in two cells ( e . g . , columns A and B ) . Input the rearranged equations for the A555 / QD and A647 / QD PL ratios in two cells ( e . g . , columns C and D ) . 14 . Open the Solver function in Excel . For end - point data or real - time data at a particular time - point , set the Solver objective so that the cell containing the equation for the A555 / QD PL ratio will have a value of zero ( e . g . , in column C ) . Set the cells containing the values of M and N ( e . g . , columns A and B ) to the variable cells that are changed by Solver . Apply the Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 81 constraint that the cell containing the A647 / QD PL ratio ( e . g . , column D ) must also have a value of zero . Use Solver to solve the system of equations and determine the values of M and N . 15 . For real - time assays , plot the values of M and N , or , alterna - tively , the change in the values of M and N from their initial values ( see Note 47 ) versus time . The resulting progress curves can be analyzed and correlated to protease activity . For end - point assays , a similar analysis can be done . Figure 6 shows an example of data from a plate reader - based pro - chymotrypsin activation assay with trypsin [ 38 ] . Figure 7 shows an example of data from a microscope - based imaging assay with a mixture of chymotrypsin and trypsin [ 39 ] . 4 Notes 1 . Photoluminescence ( PL ) refers to the emission of a photon ( i . e . , luminescence ) from the excited state of a material ( e . g . dye molecule , QD ) following the absorption of a photon to generate that excited state ( i . e . photoexcitation ) . Fluorescence is an example of a type of PL that is generally associated with dye molecules . 2 . Calculation of the spectral overlap integral , J , and the Fo¨rster distance , R 0 , are not strictly required for cFRET assays or imaging since an empirical calibration procedure is used ( see Subheading 3 . 1 ) . Refer to Notes 3 and 4 if interested in calculation of these parameters . 3 . The spectral overlap integral , J , can be calculated from a full PL spectrum of the donor and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor . To measure the full donor PL spectrum , excite the donor on the short - wavelength side of the absorption maxi - mum . Measure the absorption spectrum for the acceptor over the same wavelength range with the same wavelength step as the PL measurement . Background correct both spectra . Divide the acceptor absorption spectrum by its peak absorbance value ( i . e . , normalize the acceptor absorption spectrum ) . The shape of the spectrum will not change , but the peak value will be unity . Multiply the full absorption spectrum by the peak molar absorption coefﬁcient for the dye ( typically provided by the dye manufacturer or vendor ) . Convert the wavelength values to units of cm . For molar absorption coefﬁcients with units of M – 1 cm – 1 , further multiplication by 1000 is required to have the correct units for Eq . 2 ( mol – 1 cm 2 ) . The value of the numerator integrand of Eq . 3 can be calculated for each measured wavelength and the full integral evaluated 82 Melissa Massey et al . numerically using the trapezoidal approximation . The value of the denominator integral in Eq . 3 can also be evaluated numer - ically . Dividing the value of one integral by the other yields J . 4 . The Fo¨rster distance , R 0 , is typically calculated by assuming that the orientation factor takes on a value of κ 2 ¼ 2 / 3 and that the refractive index is n ¼ 1 . 33 – 1 . 34 for an aqueous Fig . 6 ( A ) Schematic of a pro - ChT activation assay with k QD - A555 , k A555 - A647 , and k AQD - A647 indicated by 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .

If unknown , the donor quantum yield can be deter - mined by comparison to a quantum yield standard [ 41 – 43 ] . 5 . The trend in the A1 - A2 FRET efﬁciency has appeared to follow Eq . 11 in a pair of recent studies [ 36 , 37 ] . The form of Eq . 11 is analogous to Eq . 8 and treats the multiple A2 acceptors as equivalent from the perspective of an A1 donor . The apparent suitability of this equation may reﬂect averaging of A1 - A2 FRET across the ensemble , but otherwise remains to be eluci - dated at a fundamental level in relation to the photophysics and structure of the cFRET assembly . 6 . Methods for the synthesis of high - quality CdSe / ZnS QDs have been published [ 44 – 48 ] . These procedures generally require suitable training in handling of air - and moisture - sensi - tive reagents and should not be undertaken by novices . Hydro - phobic CdSe / ZnS QDs and related CdSeS / ZnS QDs in nonpolar solvents ( e . g . toluene ) are available from commercial Fig . 7 Spatiotemporally resolved trypsin and chymotrypsin activity .

Examples of suppliers at the time of writing include , but are not limited to , Thermo - Fisher Scientiﬁc ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , Cytodiagnostics ( Burlington , ON , Canada ) , CrystalPlex ( Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) , and NN - Labs ( Fayetteville , AR , USA ) . 7 . Ligand exchange procedures have been published [ 49 – 52 ] , including the glutathione ( GSH ) ligand exchange procedure that we utilized for preparing the QDs for the cFRET probes in this chapter [ 53 ] . Non - experts can replicate many of these procedures . Common ligands that are commercially available include 3 - mercaptopropionic acid ( MPA ) and GSH . Lipoic acid is also available commercially and can be converted to a dihydrolipoic acid ( DHLA ) ligand for QDs through a one - step reduction reaction and simple puriﬁcation procedure [ 52 ] . More complex DHLA - based ligands can be synthesized when suitable chemistry expertise is available [ 49 – 51 ] . QDs coated with DHLA and DHLA - PEG ligands have also been used to prepare cFRET probes [ 38 ] . 8 . To minimize aggregation over time , store ligand - exchanged aqueous QD stock solutions at 4 (cid:5) C in borate buffer with pH 8 . 5 – 9 . 5 and low ionic strength ( (cid:6) 100 mM ) . The concen - tration should be 5 μ M or higher as dilute solutions often aggregate more quickly . Do not freeze QD solutions . 9 . Aqueous QDs with ligand coatings ( e . g . , GSH , DHLA ) are needed to permit the self - assembly of polyhistidine peptides to the ZnS shell of the QDs . The polyhistidine binds with high afﬁnity to the ZnS shell on QDs ( K d – 1 ¼ 0 . 1 – 100 nM ) [ 54 , 55 ] and equilibrium binding is usually reached in less than 1 h . QDs transferred into aqueous media using polymer or lipid coatings may prevent this self - assembly from occurring . Most commercially available aqueous QDs have polymer or lipid coatings . 10 . Detailed methods for the labeling and subsequent puriﬁcation of peptides with an N - / C - terminal hexahistidine sequence and a C - / N - terminal cysteine residue with a thiol - reactive malei - mide dye have been published [ 56 , 57 ] . Dye - labeled peptides can also be purchased from commercial vendors such as Ana - Spec ( Fremont , CA , USA ) , BioSynthesis ( Lewisville , TX , USA ) , JPT ( Acton , MA , USA ) , and New England Peptide ( Gardner , MA , USA ) . 11 . The ideal acceptor dyes , A1 and A2 , for the QD in a cFRET probe will meet the following criteria : ( 1 ) the peak PL wave - lengths of the QD , A1 , and A2 are resolved from one another , where the QD PL peak has the shortest wavelength and the A2 PL peak has the longest wavelength ; ( 2 ) there is overlap Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 85 between the PL spectrum of the QD and the absorption spec - tra of A1 and A2 ( larger overlap for A1 and smaller overlap for A2 ) ; ( 3 ) A1 and A2 have molar absorption coefﬁcients (cid:4) 10 5 M – 1 cm – 1 and quantum yields (cid:4) 0 . 10 ( higher is better ) ; ( 4 ) A1 and A2 have a common PL excitation minimum in the blue - UV region of the spectrum ( so dye excitation can be minimized while efﬁciently exciting the QD ) ; ( 5 ) A1 and A2 have good aqueous solubilities and a net negative charge ( to minimize interactions with the anionic ligands on GSH - coated QDs ) ; ( 6 ) A1 and A2 are stable in aqueous buffer ; and ( 7 ) A1 and A2 are available as maleimide or , less ideally , succinimidyl ester derivatives . In our experience , A555 , A647 , and related Cy3 and Cy5 dyes are among the best at satisfying these cumulative criteria , although other dyes may better meet indi - vidual criteria . 12 . We use the following general design strategy for peptide sub - strates , which are organized into functional modules in the order ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) - ( 3 ) - ( 4 ) - ( 5 ) - ( 6 ) : ( 1 ) a hexahistidine sequence at one terminus ( either C - or N - terminus ) to bind to the ZnS shell of the QDs ; ( 2 ) a spacer sequence with helical propensity ( e . g . , polyproline or 2 - aminoisobutyric acid / alanine ) follow - ing the hexahistidine sequence to help extend the peptide away from the surface of the QD ; ( 3 ) a short series of primarily hydrophilic amino acid residues that are not recognized by the target protease and are unreactive with the acceptor dye labeling chemistry ( vide infra ) ; ( 4 ) an amino acid residue or series of amino acid residues recognized and hydrolyzed by the target protease ; ( 5 ) another module analogous to ( 3 ) ; and ( 6 ) a terminal residue that can be selectively labeled with an acceptor dye ( e . g . , cysteine for maleimide derivatives of dyes , or a lysine residue or an N - terminal glycine for succinimidyl ester deriva - tives of dyes ) . 13 . Borate buffer is preferred when working with QDs coated with GSH or similar anionic ligands ( e . g . , DHLA ) . The useful pH range is 8 – 10 . Typical boric acid / borate concentrations are 10 – 100 mM with sodium chloride concentrations between 0 and 50 mM . If this buffer composition or pH range is unsuitable for a particular protease of interest , it can be sub - stituted by buffers with similar pH and ionic strength . For example , Tris - borate buffer can be used to lower the pH to 7 . 5 . Phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and buffers with pH < 7 . 5 are not recommended without PEG or zwitterionic ligand coatings on the QD to confer greater colloidal stability [ 58 – 64 ] . 14 . The nonbinding surface modiﬁcation of the 96 - well microtiter plate is advantageous when working with proteins but is not required . The methodology can also be adapted to other sizes of microtiter plate ( e . g . , 384 - well , 1536 - well ) . 86 Melissa Massey et al . 15 . The clear , UV - transparent , ﬂat - bottom microtiter plates are convenient for calibration of the microscope imaging format . The clear bottom is required with an inverted microscope . We have used 96 - well , 384 - well , and 1536 - well microtiter plates with clear bottoms . Multi - well / multi - chamber microscope slides can also be used . 16 . The Inﬁnite M1000 Pro plate reader ( Tecan US , Inc . , Morris - ville , NC , USA ) is a monochromator - based spectroﬂuorimetric plate reader equipped with a broad - spectrum xenon ﬂash lamp source and photomultipler tube detector . For calibration sam - ples with the prototypical QD - ( A555 ) M - ( A647 ) N cFRET con - ﬁguration , we often measure full PL emission spectra between 450 and 750 nm with 2 nm steps and 5 nm bandwidth . For real - time assays , we measure PL emission between 520 and 670 nm with 50 nm steps and 5 nm bandwidth ( i . e . , intensity measured at 520 , 570 , 620 , and 670 nm , where the data for 620 nm is discarded for the analysis ) . This four - point method decreases the time required for PL measurements , which is an important consideration in the real - time assays . The four - point method can also be used to measure the calibration samples . Other instruments with similar spectroﬂuorimetric capability and speciﬁcations should be capable of similar measurements . If using a ﬁlter - based ﬂuorescence plate reader , the technical requirements will be similar to those for a ﬂuorescence micro - scope ( see Note 17 ) . 17 . A ﬂuorescence microscope has two main requirements for cFRET imaging . The ﬁrst requirement is the ability to set up excitation and emission wavelengths comparable to those spe - ciﬁed by the optical ﬁlters noted in Subheading 2 . 2 . Relatively narrow bandpass ﬁlters are needed to satisfactorily resolve the QD and A1 ( e . g . , A555 ) emission . Either a longpass or band - pass ﬁlter can be used to resolve the emission from A2 ( e . g . , A647 ) . While we use a broadband lamp with a violet bandpass ﬁlter as an excitation source , a violet laser source ( e . g . , 405 nm ) or high power violet light - emitting diode ( LED ) light source can be substituted . Many models of camera will be satisfactory , although we recommend cameras with good efﬁciency in the red region of the spectrum . For real - time measurements , a second requirement is a mechanism of fast and automated switching between the three different emission ﬁlters and acquiring corresponding images . We achieve this switching with an automated emission ﬁlter wheel with software control . The dichroic mirror and excitation ﬁlter are mounted and controlled separately from the emission ﬁlters . A possible alter - native conﬁguration is an automated ﬁlter cube turret with a cube for each emission ﬁlter , albeit that this format requires triplication of the excitation ﬁlter and dichroic mirror . Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 87 A commercially available multichannel imaging system ( e . g . , QV2 , Photometrics , Tucson , AZ , USA ) equipped with similar ﬁlters is a third option . 18 . An example of an alternative instrument to the plate reader and microscope systems is an array - based spectrometer . Vendors such as Ocean Optics ( Dunedin , FL , USA ) and StellarNet ( Tampa , FL , USA ) sell low - cost , ﬁber - optic , USB - connected spectrometers suitable for this type of PL measurement . The free end of a ﬁber - optic patch cable connected to the spectrom - eter can be positioned to collect PL from cFRET probes in a cuvette , microtiter plate well , or another type of sample cell or holder . A violet laser , violet LED , or suitably ﬁltered broad - spectrum light source can be used for excitation . The potential disadvantages of such an apparatus are low throughput ( versus a plate reader ) and lack of imaging capability ( versus a micro - scope ) . Potential advantages include the comparatively low cost , ﬂexibility , and rapid acquisition of full spectra . 19 . When multiple data sets are to be ﬁt with the same mathemati - cal function , the variables in that function can be classiﬁed as global variables , meaning that all data sets are ﬁt with the same value for that variable ( i . e . , optimization over all data sets ) , or local variables , meaning that each data set is ﬁt with a unique value of the variable ( i . e . , optimization within individual data sets ) . Although cFRET calibration data can be analyzed with - out global ﬁtting , the use of global ﬁtting can simplify the process and produce more reliable results . 20 . A more complex calibration method utilizes mixtures of pre - digested peptide substrates and native peptide substrates . The pre - hydrolyzed peptides are prepared by proteolysis and the proteases are subsequently inhibited . In some cases , this method can better approximate the nonspeciﬁc adsorption of hydrolyzed dye - labeled peptide fragments on the QDs . We have previously described this calibration method in detail for nonconcentric QD - FRET probes for proteolysis [ 53 ] , and we have used this method to calibrate cFRET imaging probes [ 39 ] . For the basic calibration in Subheading 3 . 1 , the samples are prepared with M and N equivalents of A1 - labeled peptide - 1 and A2 - labeled peptide - 2 , respectively , per QD . For the mod - iﬁed calibration , samples are prepared with M and N equiva - lents of A1 - labeled peptide - 1 and A2 - labeled peptide - 2 per QD , as well as M max – M and N max – N equivalents of the corresponding pre - hydrolyzed peptides , where M (cid:6) M max and N (cid:6) N max . The cFRET probes subsequently used for enzyme assays have M ¼ M max and N ¼ N max . Refer to refs . 39 , 53 for more details . 88 Melissa Massey et al . 21 . The quantities in Subheading 3 . 1 and Fig . 2 are recommenda - tions for 96 - well microtiter plates . Volumes and concentrations can be varied to accommodate other microtiter plate sizes ( e . g . , 384 - well , 1536 - well ) or other varieties of sample cell . The quantities can also be scaled back if more limited amounts of material are available . We recommend QD concentrations of at least 0 . 050 μ M , but volumes can be varied as needed . 22 . The amounts of the stock and substock solutions in Subhead - ing 3 . 1 provide some excess in case a need arises to re - make a calibration sample . This excess is sufﬁcient for at least three re - made calibration samples , but does not include sufﬁcient vol - ume to prepare control samples with only dye - labeled peptide substrates ( see Note 23 ) . The stock solution is the parent solu - tion that is used to prepare further dilutions or substock solu - tions . In turn , these substock solutions are used for preparation of samples for calibration and enzyme assays . 23 . It is good practice to run a calibration experiment that also includes samples with only dye - labeled peptide substrates dis - solved in buffer . Figure 8 is an addendum to Fig . 2 that summarizes the preparation of these samples . These samples Fig . 8 Addendum to the calibration sample matrix in Fig . 2 to include control samples with different amounts of dye - labeled peptide only ( no QDs ) . These samples can be used to estimate the proportion of the dye PL from the samples in Fig . 2 that is due to direct excitation of the dyes versus FRET from the QD donor Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 89 are used to estimate the amount of dye PL that is a result of direct excitation of the dyes ( with FRET - sensitized PL accounting for the difference in the total dye PL intensity between these control samples and the calibration samples in Fig . 2 ) . If the control samples in Fig . 8 are to be prepared , the volumes of the Sub ChT ( A555 ) and Sub TRP ( A647 ) stock and substock solutions in Subheading 3 . 1 should be increased by 15 % ( for the same concentrations ) . 24 . We recommend pipetting a minimum volume of 5 μ L of sub - stock solutions to prepare samples . Larger volumes ( e . g . , 20 μ L in Fig . 2 ) are preferred for greater accuracy and precision in preparing the calibration samples . 25 . Although the QDs and A555 are quite resistant to photo - bleaching , the A647 photobleaches much more readily [ 36 ] . It is therefore good practice to incubate the samples in dark - ness . A covering of aluminum foil or a closed drawer is sufﬁcient . 26 . We have found that direct excitation of the A555 and A647 is negligible with a ~ 400 nm excitation wavelength or 405 / 20 excitation ﬁlter . If using different instrumentation or different instrument settings , it is advisable to conﬁrm that direct exci - tation of the A555 and A647 remains negligible . Alternatively , if A1 and A2 are not A555 and A647 , then an experiment to evaluate direct excitation of dye PL is recommended . Refer to Note 23 in both cases . For plate reader assays , a moderate level of direct excitation is acceptable as the empirical calibration accounts for directly excited dye PL . In imaging assays where hydrolyzed dye - labeled peptide fragments could diffuse out of the region - of - interest ( ROI ) , it is important to have negligible PL from direct excitation of the A1 and A2 dyes . 27 . For plate reader measurements ( also see Note 16 ) , the 520 , 570 , and 670 nm measurement wavelengths approximately correspond to the spectral positions of the peak QD , A555 , and A647 PL . If using a cFRET conﬁguration other than the prototypical QD - ( A555 ) M - ( A647 ) N conﬁguration , then the wavelengths will need to change to match the PL wavelengths of the new QD , A1 , and A2 . 28 . For plate reader measurements , all three peak PL wavelength measurements are usually made at the same settings by default . That is , the measurements are made with the same excitation intensity ( controlled by lamp output and excitation monochro - mator bandwidth ) and the same collection efﬁciency and sensi - tivity toward PL ( controlled by optics , emission monochromator bandwidth , and detector gain ) . We have not found it necessary to change these parameters between the three PL wavelengths , although individual optimization of 90 Melissa Massey et al . the measurement settings for the three PL wavelengths is acceptable provided that the same settings are used for both calibration and enzyme assays . 29 . For microscope imaging ( also see Note 17 ) , the 520 / 40 , 565 / 30 , and 665LP ﬁlters predominantly transmit PL from the QD , A555 , and A647 , respectively . Crosstalk is greater with the imaging ﬁlters than with the plate reader ( monochromator bandwidth ~ 5 nm ) . If using a cFRET conﬁguration other than the prototypical QD - ( A555 ) M - ( A647 ) N conﬁguration , then the ﬁlters will need to change to match the PL wavelengths of the new QD , A1 , and A2 . 30 . With our microscope system , it is possible to change the exci - tation intensity ( lamp output power ) and camera exposure time between measurements in the three ﬁlter channels . We have found it beneﬁcial to optimize the camera exposure time for each emitter ( but to maintain a constant excitation intensity ) , and have found that PL ratios varied predictably with changes in camera settings [ 39 ] . The individual optimization of the three measurement channel settings is acceptable as long as the same settings are used for both calibration and enzyme assays . 31 . We typically load the diagonal samples in the calibration matrix in Fig . 2 in an agarose gel . There is a consistent increase in the number of peptides per QD between these samples , and most gel combs will accommodate this number of samples . Using the same samples for gels that were used for the calibration PL measurements helps to ensure consistency and decreases con - sumption of materials . 32 . The maximum loading of the QD with peptides can be esti - mated from agarose gels . When the ﬂuorescent dye label on the peptide can be directly excited and visualized in a gel imaging system , the appearance of a new band corresponding to unbound dye - labeled peptide can indicate that the maximum peptide loading capacity of the QD has been reached . Our experience to date suggests that this type of experiment will provide a conservative estimate . Another indicator can be the number of peptides per QD at which the electrophoretic mobility of the QD no longer decreases ; however , it must be noted that the magnitude of the change in mobility with each added peptide decreases as the total number of peptides increases , and a clear saturation point may not be apparent . 33 . The purpose of the glycerol is to sink the sample to the bottom of the gel well . While we typically use 10 % v / v glycerol in the ﬁnal sample , we have also had success with glycerol percentages between 6 – 20 % v / v . Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 91 34 . The ﬁeld strength is the applied voltage divided by the distance between the electrodes in the gel tank . For many “mini” gel systems , the applied voltage for this ﬁeld strength will be close to 100 V . 35 . Both the GSH - coated QDs and corresponding QD - peptide conjugates should migrate as discrete bands . The bands for the peptide conjugates may appear tighter than for the QDs alone . Any streaking should be faint compared to the main band . If streaking is signiﬁcant , it may indicate a pending problem with the colloidal stability of the QDs . Signiﬁcant residue in the sample wells of the gel indicates that aggregation has occurred . In both cases , a new preparation of GSH - coated QDs is recommended . 36 . High - quality images of gels can be acquired with a suitable gel imaging system . Simple visual conﬁrmation is possible by eye when the gel is illuminated under longwave UV in a viewing cabinet . In many cases , the QD and / or dye PL will be bright enough for a digital camera or smartphone to acquire an image using the viewing cabinet ( or a hand - held UV lamp and suit - able UV - blocking ﬁlter ) . 37 . Blank ROIs for background correction can be dark areas in the calibration sample images themselves or separate images of buffer solution . If the latter , the blank images should be acquired under the same microscope settings as the calibration sample images . 38 . For the prototypical QD - ( A555 ) M - ( A647 ) N cFRET system , the A555 PL at 520 nm is negligible compared to that of the QD . Selection of a cFRET system with a different QD or dye may require consideration of crosstalk . In this case , crosstalk can potentially be corrected through a system of simultaneous equations or through formal spectral deconvolution . Very high QD quenching efﬁciencies leading to dye / QD PL ratios > 2 may also require that the dye PL crosstalk at the peak QD PL wavelength be considered . 39 . The crosstalk of A555 PL in the A647 channel can also be calculated from a sample of A555 - labeled peptide alone , directly excited at 520 nm . The crosstalk coefﬁcient remains the ratio of the PL intensity at 670 nm over the PL intensity at 570 nm , as deﬁned in Eq . 19 . This procedure is analogous to how the crosstalk is determined for the QD . It is equivalent to the method in Subheading 3 . 5 . 1 and often simpler and more convenient , especially if the procedure in Note 23 is used . 40 . The mathematical functions suggested for ﬁtting are empirical functions that often provide a good ﬁt to the data and are not necessarily theoretical expectations . The ideal empirical func - tion will ﬁt the trend in the data well and will be as 92 Melissa Massey et al . mathematically simple as possible without compromising the quality of the ﬁt . In our experience , functions that are mono - tonic over the range of M and N values are preferred . Linear functions , exponential rise - to - maximum functions , exponen - tial decay functions , and quadratic functions are good candi - dates , but we generally avoid higher order polynomials . 41 . The simplest mathematical function that ﬁts the data is recom - mended . If the data is monotonic , then a function that is monotonic over the range of the data should be used . Linear , quadratic , and exponential decay or exponential rise - to - maxi - mum functions are good candidate functions . 42 . To assay samples in r rows , multiply the volumes in steps 1 – 4 of Subheading 3 . 6 by a factor of r . The volume of QD stock solution will also need to increase by ( r (cid:1) 1 ) 30 % and the volumes of the Sub ChT ( A555 ) and Sub TRP ( A647 ) stock solu - tion will need to increase by ( r (cid:1) 1 ) 42 % . Similarly , for s indi - vidual samples , mix 12 . 5 ( s þ 2 ) μ L of 8 . 0 μ M Sub ChT ( A555 ) , and 15 ( s þ 2 ) μ L of 8 . 0 μ M Sub TRP ( A647 ) , 12 . 5 ( s þ 2 ) μ L of BB2 , and 10 ( s þ 2 ) μ L of 1 . 0 μ M QDs . Aliquot 50 μ L por - tions into s wells of a microtiter plate ( see Note 44 for an explanation of s þ 2 ) . The volumes of the QD , Sub ChT ( A555 ) , Sub TRP ( A647 ) stock solutions will also need increase . 43 . A useful test system for imaging assays is a glass capillary ( ~ 400 μ m inner diameter , ~ 1 cm length ) ﬁlled with a solution of cFRET probes . The capillary is placed on a microscope slide and a 0 . 5 μ L droplet of protease solution is placed at one end of the capillary . Hydrolysis of the cFRET probes will be observed as the protease ( s ) diffuses down the capillary . See ref . 39 for further details . This format is only one of a multitude of possible imaging formats where a protease solution is added to the cFRET probes . 44 . Step 4 of Subheading 3 . 6 provides a small excess of the cFRET probe solution . If assaying s samples , it is advisable to prepare sufﬁcient volume for s þ 2 samples . This excess provides con - tingency if one of the assay samples needs to be re - measured and ensures that exactly 50 μ L can be added to each of the 12 wells in the row of the microtiter plate . 45 . The batch preparation of cFRET probes for enzyme assays is a scale - up of the same recipe used for preparation of the corresponding calibration sample . We sometimes observe that the apparent values of M and N measured from the PL ratios of the batch preparation are larger than expected . Instead of using the maximum numbers of Sub ChT ( A555 ) and Sub TRP ( A647 ) per QD from Fig . 2 ( i . e . , M ¼ 10 , N ¼ 12 ) for enzyme assays , it can be useful to use slightly smaller numbers of these pep - tides ( e . g . , M ¼ 8 , N ¼ 9 ) . This variation is not applicable if Concentric FRET Probes for Proteolysis 93 utilizing the alternative calibration from Note 20 . Another option is to analyze the data in terms of the change in the values of M and N rather than their absolute values ( see Note 47 ) . 46 . The Solver function in Excel is one method of solving the system of nonlinear equations . In some cases it may also be possible to use iterative calculations ( i . e . , allow “circular refer - ences” in Excel ) . Other software packages such as MatLab will also have built - in functions for solving a system of nonlinear equations . 47 . The values of M and N will often give useful quantitative data . However , when scaling up or scaling down the preparation of cFRET probes , or preparing the conjugates for enzyme assays at a different time than the calibration samples , some variation in the absolute values of M and N can be observed . In these cases , the change in the values of M and N may be more effective . For example , values of M might vary between 0 and M max for an initial calibration , but data from subsequent enzyme assays may yield a result that M decreases from M ¼ M max þ 1 . 5 to M ¼ 1 . 5 over the course of the assay ( and similar for N ) . In this case , Δ M , the change in the value of M , is a more robust parameter . If large discrepancies are noted ( e . g . , M measured > M expected þ 2 ) or if a new batch of QDs or peptides is prepared , then calibration should be repeated . Also note that if M initial ¼ M max in an enzyme assay but M does not reach zero ( under conditions consistent with complete hydro - lysis ) , it may suggest nonspeciﬁc adsorption of the hydrolyzed dye - labeled peptide fragments on the QD .

McBride * , Dominique N . Price * , and Pavan Muttil Abstract The purpose of this chapter is to detail the formulation and characterization of a magnetically - targeted drug delivery vehicle , termed nano - in - microparticles ( NIMs ) , for pulmonary drug delivery . Currently , che - motherapeutics and antibiotics are delivered systemically and result in whole body side - effects . NIMs are formulated with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles , termed SPIONs , making these particles targetable to speciﬁc lung regions using a strong external magnet . Additionally , these particles can be formulated to contain any drug or therapeutic agent , such that a therapeutic dose can be delivered to a speciﬁc tissue location using the SPIONs - magnet interaction . Finally , these particles are in the appropriate size range for pulmonary delivery , making NIMs therapeutics feasibly inhalable . To generate these particles a solution containing lactose , SPIONs , and a microsphere dye ( used as a drug surrogate ) is spray - dried using a laboratory - scale spray dryer . The resulting dry powder microparticles ( NIMs ) can be characterized for their size and morphological properties by various techniques that are presented in this chapter . The utility of NIMs as a magnetic ﬁeld - dependent targeting delivery platform in an in vivo mouse model has been demonstrated , and a protocol detailing the intratracheal delivery of NIMs dry powder is included as a separate chapter in this book . Key words Spray drying , Iron oxide nanoparticles , Nano - in - microparticles , Dry powders , Pulmonary delivery 1 Introduction 1 . 1 Spray Drying for Dry Powder Manufacturing Spray drying in simplest terms , is a method of converting liquid solutions / suspensions into solid dry powders . The technique ori - ginated in the food manufacturing industry , giving perishable foods like milk a longer shelf - life . However , since the 1990s spray drying has become a well - recognized laboratory technique to create phar - maceutical dry powders compatible for pulmonary delivery [ 1 ] . Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 5 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 * These authors contributed equally to this work . 99 Spray drying is a visible process , meaning a signiﬁcant portion of the spray drier consists of glassware making the entire procedure observable . The drying process begins at the nozzle , with the atomization of a feed solution , and culminates with the production of dried powders collected in the lower collection vessel . Figure 1 shows a schematic of a typical spray dryer . First , the inlet air of the spray dryer is heated to temperatures ranging between 50 (cid:1) C and 220 (cid:1) C ( maximum ) depending on the materials being spray - dried ( Fig . 1—circle 1 ) . Next , the nozzle sprays ﬁne droplets formed from the spray drying solution / suspension ( Fig . 1—circle 2 ) . Con - ductive heat is exchanged between the spray gas ( compressed nitro - gen required to disperse the solution / suspension ) and the sample droplets in the drying chamber ( Fig . 1—circle 3 ) . The dry powders are collected in the particle collection chamber attached to the cyclone , which separates the powders from the drying medium based on its inertial forces ( Fig . 1—circle 4 & 5 ) . Fig . 1 A stepwise mechanism of the spray drying process . Nitrogen gas is heated to temperatures of 50 – 220 (cid:1) C , depending on the sample that is being spray - dried ( circle 1 ) . The sample solution / suspension is sprayed into droplets by the nozzle of the spray drier ( circle 2 ) , and these droplets are dried into powders as they fall through the drying chamber ( circle 3 ) . The powders are separated based on inertial forces as they move through the cyclone ( circle 4 ) and are collected in the collecting chamber ( circle 5 ) 100 Amber A . McBride et al . Compared to other methods of powder manufacturing like milling or lyophilization , spray drying yields dry powders with good aerodynamic properties ( e . g . , ﬂow , dispersibility , and particle size ) and offers more control over their physicochemical properties because variables like droplet atomization , drying dynamics , and liquid properties can be optimized . Operation variables can be manipulated through interrelated parameters such as the inlet air temperature , the drying air ﬂow rate ( aspirator ) , the liquid feed rate , the spray ﬂow rate ( nitrogen gas ) , as well as percent solids in the solution / suspension [ 2 ] . In addition , spray drying can be easily scaled up to produce large batches of powders . Volumes between 20 and 1000 mL can be spray - dried in approximately 1 h . Lastly , dry powders can be formulated with various excipients ( polymers , sugars , and / or amino acids ) for either controlled release or as a stabilizing agent to the encapsulated materials [ 3 , 4 ] . Spray drying of excipients such as L - leucine or polymorphic forms of drugs could result in corrugated particles that have improved dispersion behavior [ 5 – 7 ] . 1 . 2 Brief History of Therapeutic Targeting in the Lung Inhaled aerosols have emerged as an area of interest for the admin - istration of chemotherapeutic agents to the lung [ 8 – 10 ] . Otterson et al . administered inhaled doxorubicin in a phase I clinical study and later in a phase I / II clinical study ; however , pulmonary dose - limiting toxicity was observed due to the delivery of a cytotoxic agent directly into the lung [ 8 , 9 ] . Magnetic targeting has the potential to make aerosolized chemotherapy administered by the pulmonary route more effective by concentrating the inhaled drug at a target site within the respiratory tract . This has been shown through various in vitro and numerical models and in vivo magnetic targeting studies in efforts to limit exposure of healthy lung and airway tissue to the drug [ 11 ] . Magnetic ﬁeld - dependent targeted delivery of drug - containing or surrogate vehicles to speciﬁc regions of the model airways in vitro has been demonstrated previously by us and others [ 11 – 15 ] . Dames et al . and Rudolph et al . targeted nebulized micron - sized magnetic droplets containing iron oxide nanoparticles and plasmid DNA , a therapeutic mimic , to speciﬁc regions in a mouse lung [ 11 , 16 ] . Although signiﬁcant deposition was shown in the magnetized lung lobe , separation of plasmid DNA from the iron oxide nanoparticles was observed during the delivery process . 1 . 3 Super - paramagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles ( SPIONs ) SPIONs are small synthetic Fe 3 O 4 particles with core sizes ranging between 5 and 99 nm in diameter . SPIONs consist of a single ( individual ) magnetic domain of elements that can be aligned in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld allowing for mag - netic ﬁeld - dependent targeting , hyperthermia - induced cancer cell death , or MRI resonance imaging . The single domain nature of SPIONs causes demagnetization immediately after the removal of Preparation of Magnetic Nano - in - Microparticles 101 the magnetic ﬁeld . SPIONs have unique physical and chemical fea - tures such as a large surface area to mass ratio , which make them ideal for ligand attachment or for the delivery of cargo payload [ 17 ] . 1 . 4 Nano - in - Microparticle ( NIMs ) Characterization To verify that dry powder NIMs are of the appropriate size , aero - dynamic diameter , and morphology for deep lung delivery , we have compiled a list of the various characterization methods . Although protocols for the characterization methods listed below are merely mentioned and not detailed at length , we thought it was important to mention their use and importance . Examples of characterization data for NIMs size and size distribution are listed in detail later in this chapter . 1 . Size and size distribution : NIMs size ( micrometer ) based on volume equivalent diameter can be characterized using a laser diffraction particle sizer . This instrument determines the parti - cle size of dry powders based on laser obscuration and scatter - ing . SPIONs size ( nanometer ) can be measured by dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) instruments . 2 . Aerodynamic sizing : The determination of the mass median aerodynamic diameter ( MMAD ) is one of the most important characterization parameters in terms of particle deposition in the lung . MMAD and geometric standard deviation ( GSD ; the spread of the particle size distribution ) for particles are deter - mined in vitro by cascade impaction studies . Fine particle frac - tion ( FPF ) is also determined using the impactor and is deﬁned as the percentage of particles in the respirable size range of 1 – 5 μ m [ 18 ] . 3 . Moisture uptake : Hygroscopicity is the intrinsic tendency of a dry powder to absorb moisture from its surroundings [ 18 ] . Moisture uptake can result in local dissolution and recrystalli - zation , leading to irreversible aggregation through solid bridge formation , which can adversely affect powder deagglomeration during aerosol generation and ultimately lung deposition [ 19 ] . Moisture uptake can be quantiﬁed using a Karl Fischer ( KF ) coulometric titration . Dynamic Vapor Sorption ( DVS ) can also be used to determine moisture uptake in dry powder formulations . 4 . Glass transition temperature ( T g ) : Differential scanning calo - rimetry ( DSC ) is used to measure the T g of the excipients . An excipient with a high T g will remain amorphous during the spray drying process . Furthermore , if these powders are stored at a temperature lower than its T g , it slows the transitioning into the crystalline form . 5 . Drug release and dissolution properties : Drug release proﬁles are critical for inhaled drugs in order to evaluate the pharmacoki - netic proﬁle and hence the bioavailability of the drug . 102 Amber A . McBride et al . 6 . Surface characteristics : Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) is used to determine particle size and surface morphology of dry powders . 7 . X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) : XRD can be used to determine bond lengths and bond angles deﬁned by intermolecular spacing , which is directly related to crystalline properties of the material . Therefore , XRD is used to measure the crystalline or amor - phous state of excipients after spray drying . 8 . Determination of metal content : Inductively Coupled Plasma— Atomic Emission Spectroscopy ( ICP - AES ) is an analytical tech - nique that can be used for the detection of metal , for exam - ple the SPIONs ( Fe 3 O 4 ) , in the NIMs drug delivery vehicle . 9 . Superconducting Quantum Interference Device ( SQUID ) anal - ysis : SQUID analysis can be used to measure the magnetic properties of NIMs . These measurements allow the user to calculate the magnetic moment of the SPIONs as well as the concentration of SPIONs in the NIMs . This chapter details methodologies involved in the preparation of NIMs dry powders , a novel therapeutic targeting platform . The dry powders are created using unique excipients that are spray - dried , resulting in powders that are respirable , magnetically - target - able , and temperature - stable . The implications of this technology are broad , with potential use in lung cancer therapeutics , and the treatment of other respiratory illnesses . 2 Materials Prepare all solutions / suspensions using ultrapure water and store all reagents and solutions / suspensions at 4 (cid:1) C unless otherwise noted .

Wear necessary personal protective equipment . 2 . Run soapy water solution through spray dryer ( three drops soap þ 1 gal water ) . 3 . Spray dry soapy water solution for 15 – 20 min . 4 . Spray dry water solution for 15 – 20 min . 5 . Spray dry 70 % ethanol for 15 – 20 min . 6 . Clean walls and ﬂoor of chemical fume hood with soapy water and disposable towels . 7 . Wipe walls , chemical fume hood ledge , and ﬂoor with dry disposable towel . 106 Amber A . McBride et al . 4 Notes 1 . Many parameters affect actual powder yield . Generally between 50 – 70 % of solids are recovered in the collection chamber . The spray drying process is quick ; on average the time to spray dry 20 mLs of a solution / suspension is about 10 – 15 minutes . 2 . The solubility of alpha - monohydrate lactose in water is 21 . 9 g in 100 mL in water ( 21 % w / v ) . The saturation solubility of the excipient needs to be taken into account when making a spray drying solution / suspension . 3 . Water condenses inside the spray drying chamber at outlet temperatures (cid:7) 35 (cid:1) C when spray drying an aqueous solu - tion / suspension . This can introduce moisture into the ﬁnal dry powder product . Therefore , the spray dryer needs to be completely dry and run at outlet temperatures > 35 (cid:1) C before formulating any dry powders . 4 . The exhaust hose of the chemical hood , that houses the spray dryer , can be connected to a modiﬁed HEPA ﬁlter that is exhausted to outside air . 5 . During the spray drying process , some solids are inherently trapped in the ﬁlter causing a decrease in the powder yield . In the case of dry powder NIMs , SPIONs were visibly trapped in the ﬁlter . 6 . Laser diffraction particle sizing SOP notes : Assume non - spherical particle geometry and make sure to input lactose density , absorptivity , and refractive index ( 1 . 52 g / cm 3 , 0 . 010 , and 1 . 347 , respectively ) , SPION density ( 1 . 55 g / cm 3 ) , and dye density ( 1 . 05 g / cm 3 ) into the analysis software to insure correct sizing calculations . 7 . Larger particle size obtained using the laser diffraction technique is due to the agglomeration of the microparticles . Dispersive energy ( 0 – 4 bar ) is applied during dry powder particle sizing ( when using a powder disperser attachment to the laser diffrac - tion particle sizer ) to break particle agglomerates . However , dry dispersion may sometimes not be suitable for sizing microparti - cles due to the strong particle – particle cohesive attraction that may be difﬁcult to overcome . Care should also be taken that sufﬁcient dispersive energy is applied to the microparticles to obtain particle deagglomeration , while not breaking the micro - particles into smaller particles . In cases where particles are difﬁ - cult to deagglomerate , wet dispersion method could be used . 8 .

Bishnoi and Yujen Lin Abstract Gold silica nanoshells have found many applications within the ﬁeld of molecular biology , including as nanoscale sensors , the detection of biomarkers , and in the treatment of solid tumors using photothermal ablation . In order for them to be targeted to speciﬁc biomarkers while also remaining stable in biological media , it is often necessary to modify their surfaces with more than one functional group . Here , we describe how to create multifunctional gold nanoshells that can be used to either target speciﬁc tumor types in vivo or for the detection of biomarkers using biological specimen . Key words Gold nanoshells , Raman spectroscopy , Polyethylene glycol , Biomarker detection , Cancer targeting , Nitrocellulose membrane 1 Introduction It is well accepted that gold nanoshells can be used in the treatment of solid tumors [ 1 – 5 ] or in the detection of many different chemical species [ 6 , 7 ] due to their unique optical properties . The excite - ment of surface plasmons by electromagnetic radiation within the near infrared region has shown speciﬁc applicability for biological applications due to the “water window” that limits the undesirable absorption by proteins and other biomolecules within the vicinity of the nanoshells [ 1 , 8 – 10 ] . The excitement of these surface plas - mons can be used to deliver cargo off of the nanoparticle surface [ 11 , 12 ] , provide localized thermal ablation to tumors [ 4 , 13 , 14 ] , or be used for surface enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS ) detection of biomarkers [ 6 , 15 ] . For any of these applications to be successful , you must modify the nanoparticle surface to improve its compati - bility in biological media ( buffers , blood , etc . ) . The most common type of surface modiﬁcation is the grafting of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) [ 16 , 17 ] to the surface of the nanoparticle through the formation of a gold - sulfur ( Au - S ) covalent bond using thiolated PEGs . PEG allows the particles to remain in circulation for longer Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 6 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 109 periods of time in vivo and prevents their ﬂocculation in buffers to improve their shelf stability . Gold nanoshells can also be modiﬁed with targeting agents ( proteins , antibodies , peptides , etc . ) that will allow speciﬁc delivery to a tumor or the detection of biomarkers of interest [ 2 , 17 ] . In order to obtain successful targeting while maintaining their solu - tion stability , it is often critical to control the ratio of PEG to targeting agent on the nanoparticle surface . In this chapter , we describe the surface modiﬁcation of gold nanoshells , including the synthesis of a Raman active PEG [ 6 , 16 ] and biofunctionaliza - tion of an antibody with a thiol that can be used to bind to the gold surface [ 6 ] . The surface of the gold nanoshell is then modiﬁed with a targeting agent ( secondary antibody ) , as well as a Raman - active PEG that can be used to detect the presence of biomarkers in biological media ( tears , sweat , blood , and urine ) using Raman microscopy . Raman microscopy is used to verify the grafting of the Raman - active PEG to the nanoparticle surface by monitoring the ring breathing mode at 1090 cm (cid:1) 1 . By creating a half - sandwich assay on a nitrocellulose membrane ( Fig . 1 ) , we can determine the success of antibody conjugation to the nanoshells surface by visual inspection ( at high concentrations of antigen ) and through SERS ( at low concentrations of antigen ) . 2 Materials Prepare all solutions using ultrapure water ( prepared by deionizing water to have a resistance of 18 M Ω at room temperature ) .

Centrifuge the column at 5000 RCF for 5 – 10 min . 9 . Discard ﬂow - through . 10 . Resuspend the conjugate ( OPSS - PEG - Goat - anti - Rabbit IgG ) to a ﬁnal volume of 500 μ L to make a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 9 mg / mL . 11 . Aliquot the conjugate and store at (cid:1) 20 (cid:3) C until needed . The conjugate is stable for up to 6 months . 3 . 3 Characterization of Gold Nanoshells 1 . Characterize the nanoshells using dynamic light scattering to determine their average hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity . 2 . Measure UV – Vis spectrophotometry between 500 and 1000 nm to ensure that the wavelength of maximum absorp - tion ( extinction ) is near that of the excitation laser on the Raman spectrometer ( 785 nm ) ( see Notes 3 and 4 ) . 3 . 4 Multi - functionalization of Nanoshells 1 . Add 6 μ L of antibody conjugate ( 0 . 9 mg / mL ) to 1 mL of nanoshell solution ( λ max ~ 780 nm , Abs ¼ 1 . 5 , ~ 3 (cid:4) 10 9 NS / mL ) and incubate overnight on ice to allow sufﬁcient antibody coverage on the nanoshell surface . 112 Sandra W . Bishnoi and Yujen Lin 2 . To this solution , add 30 μ L of Raman - active PEG ( see Note 5 ) at a concentration of 1 (cid:4) 10 (cid:1) 4 M to obtain a ﬁnal Raman chromophore concentration of 3 (cid:4) 10 (cid:1) 6 M . 3 . Incubate this solution for 25 min on ice prior to puriﬁcation by centrifugation . 4 . Centrifuge the nanoshell - containing solution at 605 RCF for 6 min and then resuspended in MQ water . 3 . 5 Testing of PEG Attachment 1 . Conﬁrm the Raman activity of each probe synthesized by spot - ting 10 μ L of the probe onto a quartz slide and testing the Raman intensity in a Raman microscope with a 785 nm laser at 1078 cm (cid:1) 1 , corresponding to the ring breathing mode of pMA - PEG . 2 . The intensity of this peak is dependent on the coverage of pMA on the particle surface ( see Note 6 ) . 3 . 6 Testing of Antibody Attachment to the Gold Nanoshells 1 . Create antigen ( Rabbit IgG ) spots on a nitrocellulose mem - brane ( NC ) by depositing 2 μ L of diluted antigen ( Rabbit IgG ) onto a NC membrane stacked onto ﬁlter paper ( see Notes 7 and 8 ) . 2 . Dry spots on the bench for 15 min . Draw a circle around the spot with pencil to indicate where the antigen has been immobilized . 3 . Immerse the NC membrane in blocking buffer and agitate for 45 min . 4 . Remove membranes and immediately place in a solution con - taining the multifunctional gold NS ( 3 (cid:4) 10 9 NS / mL ) . 5 . Rock membranes in the probe solution for 35 min to prevent probe sedimentation and then wash using a soft stream of room temperature water to remove excess probe . 6 . Immerse membranes in cold TBST and agitate on an orbital shaker for 15 min to remove nonspeciﬁcally bound nanoshell probe . Repeat the washing process as necessary . Store mem - branes at 4 (cid:3) C until spectral analysis ( see Notes 9 and 10 ) . 4 Notes 1 . Several vendors now sell gold nanoshells that absorb in the near IR . Though the exact wavelength is not always critical for all applications , if you are coupling them with a laser you want the plasmon resonance to be near the laser wavelength . Multifunctionalization of Gold Nanoshells 113 2 . Be sure to use your gold nanoshells when they are fresh ( < 1 week old ) or if you are using commercially available parti - cles obtain samples that have been certiﬁed to be free of endo - toxins and in which excess reactants have been removed because they will be easier to functionalize . The best things to do before using your gold nanoshells are to verify that they are stable using zeta potential ( should have a surface charge of ~ (cid:1) 40 mV ) and that their shell is complete using scanning electron microscopy . Incomplete shells will not be stable for very long and have a tendency to aggregate over time . 3 . The dialysis serves two functions : ( 1 ) remove excess pMA from the product that will compete for surface sites on the nanoshell surface and ( 2 ) transfer the product into phosphate buffer from the original DMSO solvent . 4 . When working with NHS - functionalized groups , care should be taken in measuring out the NHS containing compounds . NHS can easily undergo hydrolysis , so be sure to warm vials up to room temperature before opening to prevent condensation of water . In addition , measure masses quickly to limit exposure to water . 5 . Alternatively , a commercially available Poly ( ethylene glycol ) methyl ether thiol ( mPEG - thiol ) can be used instead of the Raman - active PEG . 6 . To determine ideal surface coverage of pMA - PEG on the nano - shell surface , standards can be created by adding different amounts of pMA to the nanoshells to get a peak intensity standard curve . This will allow you to estimate the total amount of pMA on the particle surface [ 18 ] . 7 . Several different nitrocellulose membranes were tested . The best results were obtained with membranes with a 200 nm pore size . 8 . Antigen dilutions ranged from 10 ng / mL to 1 μ g / mL . 9 . At higher antigen concentrations ( over 100 ng / mL ) , the posi - tive spot is visible to the eye and appears a faint green dot within the penciled circle . 10 . Spectral mapping can be conducted with a Raman microscope equipped with a 785 nm laser .

Bishnoi and Yujen Lin Chapter 7 Fabrication of Photothermal Stable Gold Nanosphere / Mesoporous Silica Hybrid Nanoparticle Responsive to Near - Infrared Light Bei Cheng and Peisheng Xu Abstract Various gold nanoparticles have been explored in biomedical systems and proven to be promising in photothermal therapy and drug delivery . Among them , nanoshells were regarded as traditionally strong near infrared absorbers that have been widely used to generate photothermal effect for cancer therapy . However , the nanoshell is not photo - thermal stable and thus is not suitable for repeated irradiation . Here , we describe a novel discrete gold nanostructure by mimicking the continuous gold nanoshell—gold / mesoporous silica hybrid nanoparticle ( GoMe ) . It possesses the best characteristics of both conventional gold nanoparticles and mesoporous silica nanoparticles , such as excellent photothermal converting ability as well as high drug loading capacity and triggerable drug release . Key words Gold nanoparticle , Mesoporous silica nanoparticle , Redox responsive , Photothermal therapy 1 Introduction Numerous gold nanostructures have been widely used in the bio - medical ﬁeld such as drug and gene delivery , disease screening and detection , treatment and response monitoring due to their excel - lent optical properties , high biocompatibility , and ease of surface modiﬁcation [ 1 – 4 ] . The typical gold nanostructures include gold nanosphere ( GNS ) , gold nanorod ( GNR ) , gold nanoshell ( GNSH ) , and gold nanocage ( GNC ) . Among them , GNR , GNSH , and GNC have demonstrated a vast potential in converting the photon energy to heat . Upon irradiation , these gold nanopar - ticles could generate heat due to the localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR ) phenomenon [ 5 – 8 ] . The LSPR peak of GNR , GNSH , and GNC can be tuned toward the near - infrared ( NIR ) window ( 650 – 900 nm ) through manipulating their physical shape , size , and geometry . The absorp - tion in NIR window allows for a deeper penetration of various Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 7 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 117 tissues and less blood absorbance interference [ 5 ] . The penetrated NIR radiation via gold nanoparticles can be transduced into intense local heat and can be applied for photothermal therapy . This non - invasive treatment strategy has boosted the applications in numer - ous systems and especially has proven to be promising in photothermal therapy and drug delivery . However , there are several inherent concerns preventing their translation from bench to clini - cal practice . Most importantly , their poor photothermal stability has limited the clinical application for photothermal therapy . Tradi - tional gold nanoparticles gradually lose their photothermal con - verting capacity upon repetitive NIR irradiation . The shape and extinction of GNR , GNSH , and GNC get altered after repetitive NIR laser irradiation resulting in low heat generating capacity after each heating / cooling cycle if the generated heat could not be dissipated to their surrounding environment [ 9 , 10 ] . Besides that , with the exception of GNCs , the majority of gold nanostructures are poor drug carriers , which is attributed to either a limited drug - loading capacity or uncontrolled drug release proﬁle [ 11 , 12 ] . Furthermore , it still remains challenging to use them to combine photothermal therapy with chemotherapy together , especially when a frequent medication is required during a full course treatment . Similar to gold nanoparticles , mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs ) have attracted an increasing attention in their capability of loading vast drugs as well as their good biocompatibility [ 13 ] . MSNs have been extensively explored for biomedical applications , especially in drugs , proteins , peptides , DNAs , and siRNAs delivery . One of the most prominent challenges for these carriers is how to control the release behaviors of their payloads . Polyelectrolytes , macrocyclic organic molecules , and inorganic nanoparticles are among the broadly used gatekeepers to regulate the release kinetics [ 14 – 17 ] . As the function of these sensitive gatekeepers , even a slight physiological change such as pH and redox potential would trigger the delivery system and lead to the burst release of the payloads . Nevertheless , the in vivo drug release proﬁle of MSNs is entirely counting on its fabrication process and biodistribution . In order to acquire a suitable drug carrier and a reliable photothermal converting agent , as well as to take advantage of the best of both worlds , we developed a gold / mesoporous silica hybrid nanoparti - cle ( GoMe ) through conjugating gold nanospheres ( GNS ) onto the surface of MSN [ 18 ] . Here , we describe a protocol about how to prepare a novel photothermal stable gold / mesoporous silica hybrid nanoparticle [ 19 ] , which exhibits an excellent photothermal converting ability , high drug - loading capacity , and triggerable release . 118 Bei Cheng and Peisheng Xu 2 Materials All solutions are to be prepared using ultrapure water ( prepared by deionizing water to attain a resistance of 18 M Ω cm ) .

Fabrication of Photothermal Stable Nanoparticle 121 4 . All the glassware used to synthesize the gold nanoparticle has to be presoaked overnight and completely cleaned with fresh prepared aqua regia ( HCl : HNO 3 ¼ 3 : 1 , V / V ) , rinsed with DI water , and then dried in the oven prior to use . When handling with aqua regia , always conduct the work in a chemical fume hood and avoid inhaling the vapor . Neutralize the aqua regia with NaOH pellet . Be careful about the heat generated . 5 . Sodium borohydride has to be freshly prepared in methanol solution and poured into the gold solution immediately . The color of the gold solution would turn from faint yellow imme - diately into wine - red . 6 . At the step of ﬁnal conjugation of PDSA , the monomer has to be completely removed of residual organic solvents . The ﬁnal product should remain deep red . If it turns purple or black , it indicates that irreversible aggregation has occurred . The suc - cessful conjugation of PEG to gold nanoparticle is to be con - ﬁrmed by the 1 H - NMR with signature chemical shift of PEG at 3 . 6 ppm ( parts per million ) . The conﬁrmation of PDSA on the surface of AU - PEG is evidenced by co - incubation with DTT , in which it can generate pyridinethiol with UV absorbance at 375 nm . 7 . The size of GoMe is to be determined by TEM . In this chapter , it is expected that the particle size will have an average of 54 . 71 nm (cid:3) 9 . 63 nm .

Lai Abstract Poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) coatings can substantially reduce nanoparticle uptake and clearance by immune cells as well as nonspeciﬁc interactions with the biological environment , thus potentially improving nanoparticle circulation times and biodistribution in target tissues such as tumors . Naturally , the “stealth” properties of PEG coatings are critically dependent on the density and conformation of surface PEG chains . However , there are signiﬁcant technical hurdles to both generating sufﬁciently dense PEG coatings on nanoparticles and precisely characterizing their PEG grafting densities . Here , we describe methods for preparing PEGylated polymeric nanoparticles with precisely tunable PEG coatings without the use of organic solvents , quantifying PEGylation efﬁciency and density using a standard ﬂuorescence assay , and evaluating nanoparticle uptake by immune cells using ﬂow cytometry . Key words Nanoparticles , Poly ( ethylene glycol ) , PEG density , PEG conformation , Macrophage uptake 1 Introduction Because prolonged circulation times maximize nanoparticle extrav - asation into tumor tissue [ 1 ] , the avoidance of rapid clearance by mononuclear phagocyte system ( MPS ) cells ( e . g . , Kupffer cells in the liver ) is particularly important for systemically administered cancer nanotherapeutics . Poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) is a relatively hydrophilic and ﬂexible polymer that can reduce adsorption by proteins and other biomacromolecules and it has enjoyed consider - able success in extending the circulation times of protein therapeu - tics [ 2 , 3 ] . PEG coatings are also frequently used to reduce nonspeciﬁc cell uptake of nanoparticle drug carriers and other interactions with biological environments [ 4 – 7 ] . The effectiveness of stealth PEG coatings is critically dependent on the conformation adopted by its polymer chains , which in turn is determined by the PEG grafting density and molecular weight via the grafting distance ( D ) and Flory radius ( R F ) , respectively Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 8 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 125 ( see Calculation 1 ) . At increasing R F / D ratios , grafted PEG chains transition from a globular “mushroom” conformation to a more extended “brush” regime , ﬁnally reaching a highly linear “dense brush” conformation at exceedingly high PEG densities ( Fig . 1 ) [ 8 – 10 ] . Effective resistance to protein adsorption is frequently suggested to require complete PEG coverage of the nanoparticle surface , which presumably occurs at grafting densities resulting in overlapping PEG chains [ 6 , 11 ] . Interestingly , the reported stealth properties ( e . g . , extended systemic circulation time ) of PEGylated nanoparticles have been highly variable [ 6 , 12 – 14 ] . These disparities likely reﬂect not only variations in the PEG grafting density that can be achieved by different nanoparticle formulations but also the lack of effective methods to accurately and precisely quantify the density of PEG chains present on the surface of nanoparticles [ 15 ] . PEGylated nanoparticles are typically modiﬁed with 2000 or 5000 Da PEG , but , based on the few papers reporting such values , they can possess a variety of PEG surface densities ranging from low values < 0 . 1 PEG / nm 2 to higher ones > 1 PEG / nm 2 [ 5 , 12 , 16 , 17 ] . Nanopar - ticle formulation methods , composition , and physicochemical properties together control not only the optimal PEGylation strat - egy used but also the maximum achievable PEG density for each individual nanoparticle system . For example , the extent of liposome PEGylation is constrained by colloidal instability due to the pres - ence of excess PEG - lipids [ 14 , 18 ] , whereas covalent grafting of PEG onto metallic and solid polymeric nanoparticles is limited by the density of surface reactive groups or effective reactive surface area [ 10 , 17 ] . In addition to challenges in achieving comparable levels of PEG modiﬁcation across different types of nanoparticles , the extent of surface PEG density is notoriously difﬁcult to quantify for many nanoparticles without the use of complicated methodol - ogy and / or instrumentation . Direct measurements of PEG density using ﬂuorophore - labeled PEG and indirect measurements based on detection of free PEG can interfere with the integrity of stealth Fig . 1 PEG polymer conformation is determined by the R F / D value . The transition between mushroom to brush and brush to dense brush conformations is indicated by the dashed ( R F / D ¼ 1 . 0 ) and dotted ( R F / D ¼ 2 . 8 ) lines , respectively .

Lai PEG coatings or are unable to differentiate between PEG present on the surface vs . in the interior of self - assembled nanoparticles . PEG shielding of charged groups can alter nanoparticle zeta poten - tials , but surface charge measurements are at best only an indirect and inaccurate method of gauging surface PEG density , with very poor sensitivity [ 6 , 10 , 15 ] . Here , we describe the preparation of PEGylated polystyrene ( PS - PEG ) nanoparticles using commercially available polystyrene ( PS ) nanoparticles . We also describe an assay for the quantiﬁcation of surface PEG density , as well as uptake of the PS - PEG nanopar - ticles by immune cells . PS beads with well - controlled sizes and known surface densities of surface carboxyl ( COOH ) groups were modiﬁed using standard carbodiimide chemistry with amine - terminated PEG ( PEG NH 2 ) at precise COOH - to - PEG NH 2 molar ratios to control the extent of PEGylation . By harnessing the ﬂuorogenic properties of 1 - pyrenylyldiazomethane ( PDAM ) , which produces near - UV ﬂuorescence upon reacting with COOH groups [ 19 ] , we can quantify the number of COOH groups per PS - PEG or PS nanoparticle . The PEGylation efﬁciency and density of PS - PEG beads can then be indirectly determined based on the amount of residual COOH groups . This microplate - format assay is simple , requires only a small volume of sample , and avoids the need to remove unreacted reagent due to the ﬂuorogenic nature of PDAM . The PEG densities quantiﬁed using this method correlated well with those determined using ﬂuorophore - labeled PEG [ 10 ] . This assay could be used to characterize the PEG coatings of any solid nanoparticle modiﬁed through surface PEG grafting , as long as the number of available reactive groups and nanoparticle con - centration are known ( see Notes 1 – 3 ) . To evaluate the ability of various PEG coatings to evade MPS clearance , we measured the uptake of PS - PEG and PS beads by human differentiated THP - 1 ( macrophage - like ) cells using ﬂow cytometry . Through the genera - tion of nanoparticles with precisely tunable , well - characterized PEG coatings , we found that PEG grafting at substantially greater densities than those necessary to achieve a minimum dense brush conformation is essential for reducing MPS cell uptake in vitro and prolonging nanoparticle circulation in vivo [ 10 ] . 2 Materials 1 . 100 nm PS beads : yellow - green ﬂuorescent 100 nm carboxylate - modiﬁed FluoSpheres ® ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ; 2 . 7 (cid:2) 10 13 – 3 . 6 (cid:2) 10 13 particles / mL ) . 2 .

To differentiate human monocytic THP - 1 cells into macrophage - like cells , seed 500 μ L of THP - 1 cells at 1 . 7 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / mL into 24 - well tissue culture plates in cell culture media containing 200 nM PMA . All cell incubation steps should be performed at 37 (cid:4) C and 5 % CO 2 . 2 . After 3 days , remove the PMA - containing cell culture media and replace with 500 μ L of fresh cell culture media without PMA . Upon differentiation to macrophage - like cells , the THP - 1 cells should become adherent , as conﬁrmed under light microscopy . 3 . Incubate the cells with PS - PEG or PS beads at a 1 : 10 4 cell - to - nanoparticle ratio or in the absence of nanoparticles for 4 , 12 , or 24 h ( see Note 8 ) . 4 . Remove the cell culture media and wash the cells twice with Dulbecco’s PBS ( DPBS ) . 5 . Detach the cells from the 24 - well plate using 150 – 200 μ L of trypsin - EDTA for 1 – 5 min and then inhibit trypsin with 1 . 35 – 1 . 80 mL of cell culture media . 6 . Centrifuge the plate at 300 (cid:2) g for 10 min at 4 (cid:4) C . Remove the supernatant and add 500 μ L of DPBS . Repeat this step for a total of three washes . 7 . Gently resuspend the cells in at least 500 μ L of DPBS with thorough mixing to ensure that a single - cell suspension is obtained . Transfer the cell suspension into 5 mL polystyrene round - bottom tubes . 8 . Determine the cell - associated nanoparticle ﬂuorescence using a ﬂow cytometer with a 488 - nm laser and a bandpass ﬁlter cov - ering the 510 – 530 nm range . Acquire at least 10 , 000 viable cells per sample ( see Note 9 ) . For the nanoparticle ﬂuorescence histogram , set a gate using untreated cells to establish the minimum gate threshold ( Fig . 3 ) . Compare the mean ﬂuores - cence intensity and % nanoparticle - containing cells ( Gate 1 ) of Fig . 3 Sample histograms of cell - associated nanoparticle ﬂuorescence for ( a ) untreated , ( b ) densely PEGylated PS - PEG bead , and ( c ) control PS bead groups 130 Qi Yang and Samuel K . Lai each sample group to that of the PS bead group to determine the reduction in immune cell uptake of the PEGylated nanoparticles . 3 . 4 Calculations 1 . The PEG conformational regime is dependent on the Flory radius R F and grafting distance D between polymer chains , which can be determined using the following equations : R F ¼ α N 3 = 5 ð 1 Þ A ¼ 1 P ð 2 Þ D ¼ 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃ A π r ð 3 Þ where α is the monomer length of PEG ( i . e . , 0 . 35 nm ) , N is the number of PEG subunit repeats , A is the area occupied per PEG chain , and P is the PEG density ( groups / nm 2 ) . The mushroom and brush conformations are deﬁned by R F / D (cid:5) 1 and R F / D > 1 , respectively . The dense brush confor - mation occurs when the thickness of the PEG layer ( L ) exceeds the R F by at least twofold ( i . e . , when R F / D > 2 . 8 ) . L ¼ N α 5 = 3 D 2 = 3 ð 4 Þ 2 . Use the following calculations to determine the concentration of COOH groups , number of COOH groups / nanoparticle , and COOH surface density : COOH concentration mM ð Þ ¼ Charge (cid:2) % solids (cid:2) 100 % (cid:2) 10 ð 5 Þ COOH groups = nanoparticle ¼ COOH concentration (cid:2) N A 10 6 (cid:2) PS bead concentration ð 6 Þ COOH groups = nm 2 ¼ COOH groups = nanoparticle SA ð 7 Þ where N A is the Avagadro constant and SA is the nanoparticle surface area in nm 2 . Charge and PS bead concentration , as well as % solids , are typically reported on the certiﬁcates of analysis provided by the manufacturer and are given in mEq / g and PS beads / mL , respectively . 3 . Using the ex / em 480 / 520 nm data , calculate the number of PS or PS - PEG beads in each well based on the PS bead standard Engineering Well - Characterized PEGylated Nanoparticles 131 curve ( Fig . 4 ) ( see Note 10 ) . For all subsequent calculations , use the calculated number of nanoparticles per well ( Fig . 4c ) instead of the theoretical number of nanoparticles added to each well . To account for the spectral crossover from the yellow - green PS beads into the PDAM ﬂuorescence range , generate a stan - dard curve using the ex / em 340 / 395 nm data for the PS bead standard curve without PDAM ( Fig . 5a , b ) and use the trend - line equation as the crossover correction factor ( cf ) . Calculate the corrected PDAM ﬂuorescence values using the following equation ( Fig . 5c ) : CorrectedPDAMfluorescence ¼ Raw PDAMfluorescence (cid:3) bg (cid:3) cf ð 8 Þ where bg is the average PDAM background ﬂuorescence in the blank ( 0 μ L PS bead ) wells .

( c ) Corrected PDAM ﬂuorescence values calculated according to Eq . 8 . PS bead standard curve ( thick border ) , PS bead standard curve without added PDAM reagent ( dotted border ) , and two different PS - PEG samples ( dashed border ) 132 Qi Yang and Samuel K . Lai the blank wells only require correction for bg ( i . e . , do not include cf in the calculation for blank wells ) . Using the corrected PDAM ﬂuorescence values , calculate the number of COOH groups in each well based on the PS bead standard curve ( Fig . 6a , b ) . The PEGylation efﬁciency ( % ) and PEG density ( P ) can be determined using the following equations ( Fig . 6c , d ) : % residual COOH ¼ Residual # COOH groups # nanoparticles (cid:2) Initial COOH groups = nanoparticle (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) 100 % ð 9 Þ % PEGylation ¼ 100 (cid:3) % residual COOH ð 10 Þ P ¼ % PEGylation (cid:2) initial COOH groups = nm 2 ð 11 Þ 4 Notes 1 . For nanoparticles with reactive surface groups other than COOH , alternative ﬂuorogenic compounds ( e . g . , amine - reactive ﬂuorescamine ) can be used . 2 . If using nanoparticles other than ﬂuorescent PS beads , the number of nanoparticles added to each well of the microplate PDAM assay should ideally be quantiﬁable using absorbance or ﬂuorescence during the course of the assay to help to ensure the accuracy of the PEG density calculations . However , if such detection is not possible for a particular nanoparticle system , the concentration of PEGylated and unmodiﬁed nanoparticles could also be determined using nanoparticle tracking analysis or other methods prior to the PDAM assay [ 20 ] . 3 . The ﬂuorescence intensity generated by PDAM differs between various COOH - containing reagents ( e . g . , 100 nm PS beads vs . Fig . 6 Sample data and calculated residual COOH ( % ) and PEGylation ( % ) ( a ) Standard curve for corrected PDAM ﬂuorescence vs . number of COOH groups . ( b ) Number of COOH groups calculated based on the standard curve . ( c ) Residual COOH ( % ) calculated according to Eq . 9 . ( d ) PEGylation efﬁciency ( % ) calculated according to Eq . 10 . PS bead standard curve ( thick border ) , and two different PS - PEG samples ( dashed border ) Engineering Well - Characterized PEGylated Nanoparticles 133 200 nm PS beads vs . glycine ) , so separate standard curves of corresponding unmodiﬁed nanoparticles should be prepared for each type of PEGylated nanoparticle being characterized . 4 . The PEGylation procedure described here can be applied to carboxylate - modiﬁed PS beads of any size . However , the cen - trifugation time required to pellet PS nanoparticles will vary depending on their size . For PS beads (cid:6) 200 nm in diameter , a centrifugation time of 20 min or less is typically sufﬁcient . PS nanoparticles smaller than ~ 70 nm in diameter cannot be read - ily pelleted using a microcentrifuge and should be washed using ultraﬁltration or other methods . Due to their size , PS beads in the 70 – 150 nm range may not be fully pelleted even after 1 h of centrifugation with a typical benchtop microcen - trifuge , resulting in partial loss of nanoparticles with each wash step . The supernatant from each wash step could be subjected to another round of centrifugation to improve sample recovery . 5 . The commercially available PS beads used in this protocol are highly monodisperse with a very narrow size distribution , and PS - PEG nanoparticles also generally exhibit similar properties , with a slight increase in average nanoparticle size and distribu - tion due to PEGylation . Aggregation is rarely observed for 100 nm PS - PEG beads fabricated using this protocol , but the size , polydispersity , and surface charge of each batch of PS - PEG beads should nevertheless be characterized to ensure that the resulting nanoparticles exhibit acceptable physicochemical properties [ 20 ] , particularly because nanoparticle aggregation results in inaccurate PDAM assay results . Fully PEGylated PS beads are highly stable under storage at 4 (cid:4) C . 6 . The volume of PS - PEG sample used in the PDAM assay should be adjusted based on the relative concentration of the PS - PEG beads compared to the stock PS beads . The amount of PS - PEG beads added to each well should be equivalent to 1 – 2 μ L of stock PS beads . The concentration of PS - PEG beads can be determined by comparing the PS - PEG sample ﬂuorescence to that of stock PS beads ( see Calculation 3 , Fig . 4 ) . 7 . A saturated PDAM solution should be used ( solubility limit ~ 0 . 3 mg / mL ) ; the presence of a minute amount of undissolved PDAM does not appear to affect the assay results . The PDAM solution should be prepared immediately prior to its addition to the microplate wells . 8 . Due to minor variations in cell growth and differentiation efﬁciency , an additional two to three wells should be included during the PMA - induced differentiation step for each run of the cell uptake assay . The number of viable differentiated THP - 1 cells in these wells should be counted and averaged to establish the amount of particles required for a 1 : 10 4 cell - to - nanoparticle ratio . 134 Qi Yang and Samuel K . Lai 9 . A live / dead cell stain such as propidium iodide and 7 - AAD can be used to exclude dead cells from the ﬂow cytometric analysis . However , care must be taken in selecting live / dead stains that do not exhibit spectral overlap with the yellow - green PS beads and in performing ﬂuorescence compensation . For more detailed explanations of methods for assessing cell uptake of nanoparticles , ﬂuorophore selection , compensation , and addi - tional ﬂow cytometry techniques , please refer to [ 21 – 23 ] . 10 . For the PS bead standard curve , the number of PS beads and number of COOH groups are simply a factor of the PS bead volume . Thus , the PS bead volume could be used in place of these two parameters for all of the steps in Calculation 3 . The three standard curves depicted in Figs . 4 , 5 , and 6 would then be replaced with yellow - green particle ﬂuorescence vs . PS bead volume ( Fig . 7 ) , PS bead crossover into the PDAM spectrum vs . calculated PS bead volume ( Fig . 8 ) , and corrected PDAM Fig . 7 Sample data and calculated PS - PEG bead volumes . ( a ) Raw data for yellow - green bead ﬂuorescence ( ex / em 480 / 520 nm ) . ( b ) Standard curve for particle ﬂuorescence vs . PS bead volume .

For all samples , the calculated number of nanoparticles and number of COOH groups would be replaced by ( a ) the effective “volume” of stock PS beads calculated based on yellow - green ﬂuorescence and ( b ) that calculated based on PDAM ﬂuorescence , respectively . The residual COOH ( % ) would then be : % residual COOH ¼ a b (cid:2) 100 % ð 12 Þ References 1 .

Richards and Robert B . Campbell Abstract Designing an effective nanoparticle for selective drug transport requires careful consideration of the complex biological barriers encountered in transit to the desired target . Here , we review several of these barriers , and provide possible methods for formulating liposomal nanoparticles to overcome them . The methods include the biotinylation of an antibody , and subsequent conjugation to a PEGylated cationic lipid nanoparticle . Additionally , the incorporation of drug , and other relevant characteristics of the nanoparticle are also discussed . Key words Nanoparticles , Liposomes , Barriers , Bevacizumab , Angiogenesis , Drug resistance , Drug carriers , Drug delivery systems 1 Introduction The major challenge of chemotherapy is delivering clinically rele - vant concentrations of the agent to the desired target site . The use of conventional strategies to administer FDA approved agents is usually not sufﬁcient to target tumors , at least not without causing signiﬁcant harm to normal healthy tissues . For this reason , nano - vehicle drug delivery systems have been developed to maximize the drug exposure to the target , while minimizing off - target effects . In designing a chemotherapeutic drug - loaded nanovehicle there are a number of biologic barriers that must be considered , and overcome . Upon intravenous administration , the innate immune system represents an immediate and formidable barrier to nanoparticle drug delivery [ 1 – 3 ] . Following injection , serum proteins called opsonins begin adsorbing to the surface of nanoparticles , marking them for destruction by cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system ( MPS ) [ 4 ] . Stealth liposomes , which incorporate surface modiﬁers such as polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , have been shown to limit opso - nization and subsequent recognition by the MPS . Due to reduced internalization by resident macrophages in the liver , lung , and Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 9 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 139 spleen , PEGylated liposomes have extended circulation half - lives and improved tumor targeting . This discovery has brought us a step closer to the magic bullet [ 5 ] . The unique physiology of solid tumors presents a number of additional barriers to drug delivery . Normal vasculature is hierar - chical and evenly distributed , due to a tightly regulated balance of pro - angiogenic and anti - angiogenic growth factors [ 6 ] . The forma - tion of tumor neovascular networks is driven by the over - production of vascular growth factors such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) , and the subsequent development of a highly disorganized maze of immature blood vessels [ 7 – 9 ] . Tumor micro vessels often display discontinuous endothelium , with open gaps and fenestra , making them more “leaky” than the normal endothelium . Additionally , the lymphatic system around the tumor is poorly developed . Taken together , there is a propensity for accumulating interstitial ﬂuids , thus raising the interstitial ﬂuid pressure ( IFP ) and disrupting the osmotic and hydrostatic pressure gradients [ 10 , 11 ] . Nanoparticles must rely on diffusion to travel through tissue with elevated IFP , and cannot easily penetrate large tumors . During the drug discovery process , pharmaceutical companies screen large compound libraries to identify lead candidates . The classic approach involves screening the library for compounds that have the highest biological activity against a given target . Many of the drugs identiﬁed with this approach are highly lipophilic . This presents a difﬁcult challenge considering that with high lipophili - city , drugs typically exhibit greater off - target effects and higher toxicity . Over the last 15 years , pharmaceutical companies have increasingly adopted pharmacokinetic - guided screening , to predict compounds likely to succeed in clinical trials [ 12 ] . Drugs that do not conform to these properties are typically abandoned early in the drug discovery process , independent of biological activity . Nano - drug delivery is particularly well suited for drugs that display high biologic activity , but unfavorable physicochemical properties . With the nano - drug delivery approach , the physicochemical properties of the nanovehicle become the critical factor , rather than the drug itself . A wide range of materials have been utilized in the develop - ment of nano - drug delivery systems , each with unique physico - chemical properties and modiﬁable elements [ 13 , 14 ] . The following procedure describes the preparation of a liposo - mal nanoparticle capable of overcoming both physiological and cellular barriers . The resulting nanovehicle has a hydrodynamic size of around 100 nm , allowing it to evade both renal and hepatic elimination . The incorporation of PEG extends circulation time by limiting enzymatic degradation , and recognition by the innate immune system . Our preparation includes the conjugation of bev - acizumab , an antibody inhibitor of VEGF - A , to the PEGylated liposome . The antibody selected here was chosen as part of a 140 Steven M . Richards and Robert B . Campbell comprehensive antitumor approach . By exploiting known tumor features we can improve the targeting of drugs to solid tumors . The two tumor features exploited for therapeutic gain were , ( 1 ) VEGF - vascular endothelial growth factor production and its role in tumor growth and development , ( 2 ) and the tumor vascular supply . A goal of our novel delivery vehicle was to ﬁrst scavenge up circulating levels of soluble VEGF in blood , and to use the resulting carrier complex ( that contains both conjugated and scavenged VEGF variety ) to selectively target tumors . In addition , we simul - taneously capitalize on the favorable interactions between a cationic nano - carrier molecule and the anionic functional groups that line tumor endothelia . The comprehensive strategic approach was supported by a previously published study that conﬁrmed that the conjugation of bevacizumab to the distal end of PEGylated liposomes increased their uptake not only by pancreatic tumors , but by VEGF expres - sing endothelial cells as well [ 15 ] . Alternative strategies have con - jugated biomimetic components such as “self” peptides as a means to further elude clearance by the innate immune system [ 16 ] . 2 Materials 1 .

Various techni - ques aimed at controlling liposome size have been described [ 18 – 21 ] . The surface charge and zeta potential values are impor - tant measurements used in the formulation development process and in the regulation of tissue disposition . Dynamic light scattering is one of the most frequently used approaches to attaining particle sizes and zeta potential . A particle size analyzer , such as the Nano - Brook 90Plus , allows for a fast and accurate assessment of these parameters . 1 . Dilute liposome suspension to 1 . 0 % in 2 – 3 mL 1 (cid:1) PBS . Nanovehicles to Overcome Biological Barriers 143 2 . Pipette dilution into acrylic square compatible with the particle size analyzer . 3 . Analyze the sample .

Tris or glycine buffers are incompatible with NHS - LC Biotin , and should be avoided . 2 . Prepare standard mol % stock lipid solutions in an organic sol - vent such as chloroform . Glass syringes must be used when working with organic solvents , as serological pipettes will be dissolved . Lipid aliquots should be stored at (cid:3) 70 (cid:4) C in a glass tube with a Teﬂon lined cap . Be sure to follow the vendors recommended storing and handling conditions to prevent unwanted degradation of the material . 3 . Immediately prior to use , prepare 10 mM solution of biotin reagent by dissolving 2 . 68 mg biotin in 1 . 34 mL ultrapure water . Stock NHS - LC biotin should be stored as a solid at 4 (cid:4) C . 4 . Unopened vial can be stored at 2 – 8 (cid:4) C . It can be stored at 2 – 8 (cid:4) C for up to 8 h following dilution . 5 . Immediately prior to use , reconstitute NeutrAvidin with ultra - pure water and then dilute to 1 mg / mL with 1 (cid:1) PBS . Store the stock NeutrAvidin at 4 (cid:4) C . 6 . Antibody must be dissolved in an amine - free buffer at pH 7 . 2 – 8 . Many commercial antibodies are not shipped in solutions that are not compatible , which necessitates the buffer exchange . 7 . Consult a reference to determine the lipid in the formulation with the highest phase transition temperature ( Tc ) . Keep the lipid preparation above this temperature from the hydration step throughout the experiment . 8 . If interested in preparing a liposome with soluble drug in the aqueous core ; dissolve the desired concentration of drug in 1 (cid:1) PBS prior to reconstitution of dry lipid ﬁlm . Following the sonication step , dialyze to remove free drug . For drugs that are not readily soluble in PBS , drug entrapment can be accomplished via the pH gradient method as previously described [ 22 ] . 144 Steven M . Richards and Robert B .

Murali , and Rockford Draper Abstract Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) and related polymers are often used in the solubilization and noncovalent functionalization of carbon nanomaterials by sonication . For example , carbon nanotubes are frequently sonicated with PEG - containing surfactants of the Pluronic ® series or phospholipid - PEG polymers to noncovalently functionalize the nanotubes . However , PEG is very sensitive to degradation upon sonication and the degradation products can be toxic to mammalian cells and to organisms such as zebraﬁsh embryos . It is therefore useful to have a simple and inexpensive method to determine the extent of potential PEG sonolysis , as described in this chapter . Intact PEG polymers and degraded fragments are resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis and visualized by staining with barium iodine ( BaI 2 ) . Digitized images of gels are acquired using a ﬂatbed photo scanner and the intensities of BaI 2 - stained PEG bands are quantiﬁed using ImageJ software . Degradation of PEG polymers after sonication is readily detected by the reduction of band intensities in gels compared to those of non - sonicated , intact PEG polymers . In addition , the approach can be used to rapidly screen various sonication conditions to identify those that might minimize PEG degradation to acceptable levels . Key words Polyethylene glycol , Pluronic ® , Phospholipid - PEG , Sonication , SDS - PAGE , Carbon nanotubes , Functionalization , Nanotoxicity 1 Introduction Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) and related polymers are often used as dispersants in the preparation of carbon nanotubes and other nano - materials ( NMs ) for use in aqueous environments . Various PEG constructs are also used in the covalent or noncovalent functionali - zation of NMs , often to provide functionalities for appending speciﬁc ligands to the NMs for biomedical applications . It is well known that ultrasound sonication involved in the dispersion and functionaliza - tion processes generates cavitation bubbles that collapse , producing high local heat , pressures , and shear forces [ 1 – 3 ] . In addition , soni - cation in aqueous media is capable of splitting water into hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals that combine to produce H 2 O 2 and free radicals . Both sonolytic damage and free radical attacks on polymers Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 10 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 147 have been proposed to contribute to the degradation of PEG [ 4 – 6 ] , a lipid – PEG conjugate [ 7 ] , and PEG - containing block copolymers of the Pluronic ® series ( also known as poloxamers ) [ 8 , 9 ] . Results of our recent studies [ 10 , 11 ] further demonstrate that the sonolysis of PEG and PEG - containing polymers , including Pluronic ® F - 68 and F - 127 ( also known as poloxamer 188 and 407 ) and phospholipid - PEG ( PL - PEG ) constructs , is greatly affected by the ultrasound power , frequencies , and sonication times . Moreover , sonolysis of Pluronic ® surfactants generates degradation products that are highly toxic to cultured cells and zebraﬁsh embryos after probe or bath sonication [ 10 , 12 ] . Thus , it is crucial to monitor polymer integrity after sonication under the speciﬁc experimental conditions used to determine whether structural alterations in polymer structure have occurred and whether potentially toxic byproducts have been gen - erated . Described here is a simple and inexpensive approach to rapidly detect sonolytic damage to PEG polymers that does not require expensive instrumentation such as a mass spectrometer . The ﬁrst step in the method outlined here is to prepare a sample of sonicated PEG under conditions anticipated to degrade the polymer . The sonicated PEG provides a positive control of degraded material while non - sonicated PEG provides a negative control of intact mate - rial . The second step involves sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) that is modiﬁed to resolve the intact PEG material and its degraded fragments in the gel [ 13 ] . After electrophoresis , PEG bands in the gel are stained with BaI 2 [ 14 ] . An inexpensive ﬂat - bed photo scanner capable of producing uncom - pressed image ﬁles with high resolution is sufﬁcient to convert a SDS - PAGE gel with BaI 2 - stained PEG bands into a digital image ﬁle . Finally , the relative amounts of intact or degraded PEG in the gel are quantiﬁed using the free ImageJ software . The SDS - PAGE plus BaI 2 staining method is now routinely embedded in our studies of nanotoxicology and cancer therapy research where sonication of various types of PEG - containing polymers is used [ 10 – 12 ] . 2 Materials 1 .

ImageJ 1 . 50b ( available as of September 2015 , see Note 5 ) on a Windows 7 computer with Java 1 . 6 . 0 _ 20 ( 64 - bit ) installed . 3 Methods 3 . 1 Preparation of PEG Sonolysis Positive Control Samples The following procedures describe sonication conditions using a bath sonicator in a 4 (cid:1) C cold room . 1 . Rinse a glass vial and cap ( 27 . 25 (cid:3) 57 mm screw thread vial with rubber lined cap ) three times with MilliQ water , place in a metal autoclave basket covered loosely with aluminum foil and bake at 200 (cid:1) C for 2 h to destroy potential endotoxin con - taminants ( see Note 6 ) . Allow the glass vial and cap to cool down to room temperature before use . 2 . Fill the glass vial halfway with 10 mL of 0 . 2 mM PEG solution , and chill to 4 (cid:1) C prior to sonication ( see Note 7 ) . 3 . Prechill the bath sonicator and the cooling coil that connects to a refrigerated water bath circulator to 4 (cid:1) C in a cold room ( see Note 8 ) . 4 . Fill the bath sonicator tank with 1400 mL of 4 (cid:1) C distilled water , just below the maximum water level marked inside the tank . Hang the cooling coil into the tank , on the inner sidewall , such that the coil is immersed in the water bath . 5 . Secure the glass vial on a rack that hangs over the sonicator tank such that the vial is suspended in a central position in the sonication bath and the PEG solution in the vial is below the water bath level ( see Note 9 ) . Use only one vial at a time and place it in the same position each time , as changing location can change the power delivered to the vial . 6 . Operate the sonicator at 37 kHz frequency ( see Note 10 ) and 100 % power output level that corresponds to 120 W speciﬁed by the manufacturer ( see Note 11 ) . 7 . Collect a 100 μ L aliquot of PEG sample from the vial at 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , and 90 min of sonication . Terminate the sonication at 120 min . 8 . Store all sonicated and non - sonicated PEG samples at 4 (cid:1) C for later use . 3 . 2 Resolving PEG by SDS - PAGE Skip to step 9 if using pre - cast SDS - PAGE gels . The procedures described below in steps 1 – 9 are for casting multiple standard 4 % stacking , 15 % resolving SDS - PAGE mini - gels using a commercial gel caster system . 1 . A gel sandwich consists of a single glass plate , a single alumina plate , and the gel between them . Assemble a stack of multiple gel sandwiches using two 1 . 5 mm spacers ﬂanked between one 150 Ruhung Wang et al . 8 cm (cid:3) 10 cm glass plate and one alumina plate of the same size for each gel ( see Note 12 ) . Place gel sandwiches in gel caster ( see Note 13 ) , ensure the glass plate of each sandwich faces the front . Secure caster faceplate onto the caster using clamps on both sides ( see Note 14 ) . Insert a gel comb into the ﬁrst gel sandwich facing the front ; make a mark at 1 cm below the bottom of the comb teeth on the caster faceplate to help judge how much acrylamide solution to pour into the gel later , and then remove the comb . 2 . Prepare 10 mL of 15 % acrylamide resolving gel solution for each gel by combining the following reagents in order in a 50 - mL disposable plastic conical centrifuge tube : 3 . 75 mL MilliQ water , 2 . 5 mL of 1 . 5 M Tris – HCl ( pH 8 . 8 ) , 3 . 75 mL of 40 % acrylamide , and 100 μ L of 10 % SDS . Mix by gentle inversions . Add 100 μ L of 10 % ammonium persulfate and 5 μ L of TEMED , mix by gentle inversion and immediately pour about 8 mL of the resolving gel mixture into a gel sandwich ( the openings created by gaps between spacers ) by draining along one side of the sandwich to avoid bubble formation . Fill the sandwich to the 1 - cm mark drawn on the faceplate , gently rock the caster from side to side and tap the bottom of the caster against the bench top to allow air bubbles to rise up to the top , and gently overlay each gel with 400 μ L of water - saturated isobutanol ( see Note 15 ) . 3 . Let the caster stand until the resolving gel has completely polymerized , which usually takes about 30 min ( see Note 16 ) . 4 . Decant the isobutanol , gently ﬁll the caster with MilliQ water using a squirt bottle , then decant the water and invert the caster on a paper towel to drain out water ( see Note 17 ) . 5 . Prepare 5 mL of 4 % acrylamide stacking gel solution for each gel by combining the following reagents in order in a 50 - mL disposable plastic conical centrifuge tube : 3 . 15 mL water , 1 . 25 mL of 0 . 5 M Tris – HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 0 . 5 mL of 40 % acryl - amide , and 50 μ L of 10 % SDS . Mix by gentle inversions . Add 50 μ L of 10 % ammonium persulfate and 5 μ L of TEMED , mix by gentle inversion as before and immediately pour onto the resolving gel , allowing excess stacking gel mixture to overﬁll the sandwich , scrape off bubbles on the top . 6 . Quickly insert a 10 - well gel comb ( 1 . 5 mm thick ) into the gel sandwich , at a slight angle to prevent trapping air , and allow the comb sides to rest on the top of the spacers ( see Note 18 ) . Insert the remaining combs from back to front sandwiches in the same manner rather quickly before the gel polymerizes ( see Note 19 ) . 7 . Let the stacking gel stand until polymerization is complete , which usually takes ~ 60 min . Detecting Polyethylene Glycol Sonolysis 151 8 . Using a razor blade , detach the stack of gel sandwiches from the caster and separate them into individual gel sandwiches . Take care to keep the comb and spacers between the glass and alumina plates in place . Scrape excess gel from front and back of plates , spray with MilliQ water and wrap the gel sandwiches in plastic wrap , lay ﬂat in a container with air - tight lid and store at 4 (cid:1) C for later use ( see Note 20 ) . 9 . Install a gel sandwich containing a 4 % stacking , 15 % resolving SDS polyacrylamide gel on a gel electrophoresis apparatus , glass plate facing the front , ﬁll the reservoirs with electropho - resis buffer , and remove the comb ( see Note 21 ) . 10 . Put 10 μ L of sonicated or non - sonicated 0 . 2 mM PEG sample in a microcentrifuge tube . Add 10 μ L of 2 (cid:3) concentrated SDS sample loading buffer to each tube and mix the contents . 11 . Heat the sample in a water bath or a heating block at 100 (cid:1) C for 3 min . 12 . Centrifuge the heated samples at 1000 (cid:3) g for 10 s to bring down any condensate on the sides and caps of the tubes . 13 . Load samples into the gel well ( 20 μ L of heated sample per lane ) by using a ﬁne - tipped long gel - loading pipette tip to layer samples onto the well underneath the buffer . Electrophorese at a constant voltage of 100 V ( see Note 22 ) until the blue dye front ( from the BPB dye in the samples ) has reached 0 . 5 – 1 cm from the bottom of the gel . This will take about 2 h ( see Note 23 ) . 14 . Following electrophoresis , detach the gel sandwich from the electrophoresis apparatus , gently loosen and slide away both spacers , and pry the gel plates open with a small spatula . While the gel adheres to the alumina plate , use a razor blade to cut through the gel along the interface between the stacking and resolving gels , and discard the stacking gel . Carefully lift the resolving gel and immerse it into a tray of water ( see Note 24 ) . 3 . 3 BaI 2 Staining of PEG Bands 1 . Rinse the gel with distilled water and soak it in 100 mL of gel ﬁxing solution for 5 min . Slosh the solution over the gel gently on a shaker . 2 . Decant the ﬁxing solution carefully ; save it in a glass bottle and store at room temperature for reuse up to ﬁve times . Rinse the gel with distilled water , and soak it in 100 mL of BaCl 2 solution for 10 min on a shaker . 3 . Decant the BaCl 2 solution carefully ; save the BaCl 2 solution for reuse up to ﬁve times . The color of the blue dye near the bottom of the gel will fade with staining and a horizontal strip of the gel near the dye front will turn white while the rest of the gel remains semi - transparent . Rinse the gel again 152 Ruhung Wang et al . with distilled water , and then soak it in 100 mL of 5 % iodine solution for 5 min or until dark brown bands appear in the gel ( see Note 25 ) . Longer exposure to iodine leads to darker background color . 4 . Decant the iodine solution carefully back into a glass bottle ( see Note 26 ) ; it can be reused multiple times until the color of the iodine solution becomes lighter . Remove excess iodine staining in the gel background by soaking the gel in distilled water while gently shaking , and replace with clean water when the water color turns brown . Repeat the de - staining with water multiple times until the PEG bands in the gel are readily visible and the rest of the gel is clear of any yellowish background stain ( see Note 27 ) . Cover the container in which the gel is soaking with a lid to protect the gel from incident light ( see Note 28 ) . 3 . 4 Scanning BaI 2 - Stained SDS - PAGE Gels Using a Flat - Bed Photo Scanner 1 . Conﬁgure the ﬂat - bed scanner such that the gel is scanned using the highest pixel density ( 600 pixels per inch or greater ) , highest color - depth ( a 16 - bit Red Green Blue color palette or greater ) , and the image ﬁle is saved in an uncompressed TIFF ( Tagged Image File Format ) format ( see Note 29 ) . Also , a preview feature in the software is important to restrict scanning to only the area that contains the gel , otherwise the image ﬁles become substantially larger than a regular photo or docu - ment ﬁle . 2 . Lay a clean and dry sheet of write - on transparency ﬁlm on the scanner bed . Rotate and / or ﬂip the gel in the water tray to the proper orientation before carefully lifting it out and laying it down slowly on the transparent sheet . Avoid trapping air bub - bles underneath the gel . Do not push or pull the gel once it is laid ﬂat on the sheet . Lift the sheet and rotate it slightly to position the gel straight on the scanner bed . Fill the sample loading wells with water to minimize shadows casted from the gel walls on the sides of the wells . Add a few drops of water on the gel , if necessary , to prevent dehydration . Gently lay another transparent sheet on top of the gel ; from side - to - side to avoid trapping bubbles . Place a few sheets of crisp white paper over the transparent sheet and close the scanner lid before starting the scan . 3 . At the preview step , crop the scan area to include only the gel or a portion of the gel of interest . Inspect the preview image to make sure air bubbles and water marks are absent . Also , rotate the preview image to match the correct orientation of the gel . 4 . After scanning , preserve the gel by wrapping in plastic wrap ( see Note 28 ) , store ﬂat at 4 (cid:1) C protected from light , or discard it . Detecting Polyethylene Glycol Sonolysis 153 3 . 5 Quantifying PEG Band Intensity Using ImageJ Software The following procedures outline only the essential steps required for quantifying BaI 2 - stained PEG band intensities , as shown in Fig . 1 . 1 . Launch ImageJ software ( see Note 5 ) . 2 . Open Fig . 1 image ﬁle using File ! Open in ImageJ . 3 . Crop the horizontal section of the gel marked ‘Intact PEG Band’ ( see Note 30 ) : l Choose the Rectangular Selections Tool from the ImageJ toolbar . l Draw a rectangle around the ‘Intact PEG Band’ section across the gel ( see Note 31 ) . l Crop the selected area using Image ! Crop ( see Note 32 ) . l Save the cropped ‘Intact PEG Band’ gel section image using File ! Save as ! Tiff , and give it a File _ name . tiff , then hit Save . 4 . The gel analysis routine requires the image to be a grayscale image . l Convert the cropped RGB image to grayscale using Image ! Type ! 32 - bit . l Save the grayscale image using File ! Save as ! Tiff , and give it a File _ name . tiff , then hit Save . 5 . If needed , the brightness and contrast of the grayscale image can be adjusted ( see Note 33 ) . 6 . To acquire the total pixel intensity of the intact PEG bands before and after sonication , a rectangular area around the band Fig . 1 Representative sonolysis of polyethylene glycol as a function of bath sonication time resolved by SDS - PAGE with BaI 2 stain . PEG 8000 at a concentration of 0 . 2 mM was sonicated using an ultrasonic bath operated at 37 kHz and 120 W . A representative gel was loaded with 10 μ L of PEG samples acquired after bath sonication for different times . Intact PEG polymers and degradation products in the sonicated and non - sonicated PEG samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE followed by BaI 2 staining 154 Ruhung Wang et al . is selected in each lane where the pixel intensity proﬁle within a rectangle is plotted : l Choose the Rectangular Selections Tool from the ImageJ toolbar . l Draw a rectangle around the intact , non - degraded PEG band in lane 1 on the far - left of the grayscale gel image , as shown in Fig . 2 ( see Note 34 ) . l After drawing the rectangle over the band in ﬁrst lane , press the “1” key on the keyboard or go to Analyze ! Gels ! Select First Lane to set the rectangle in place . The non - sonicated PEG band in lane # 1 will now be high - lighted and have a “1” marked in the middle of it ( see Note 35 ) . l Use the mouse to click and hold in the middle of the “1” rectangle on the ﬁrst lane and drag it over to the next lane on the right , where the 15 - min sonicated sample was loaded . Center the rectangle over the lane left - to - right , but don’t worry about lining it up perfectly on the same vertical axis . ImageJ will automatically align the rectangle on the same vertical axis as the ﬁrst rectangle . l Press the “2” key on the keyboard or go to Analyze ! Gels ! Select Next Lane to set the current rectangle in place . The 15 - min sonicated PEG band in lane # 2 will now be highlighted and have a “2” marked in the middle of it , as shown in Fig . 2 . l Repeat these steps for the rest of bands in lanes # 3 to # 7 , in order from left to right , on the gel . Make sure to press the “2” key each time ( not to press 3 , 4 , 5 . . . ) to set the rectangle in place ( see Note 36 ) . l Save the grayscale gel image with rectangles set around the bands , shown as Fig . 2 , using File ! Save as ! Tiff , and give it a ﬁle name such as PEG _ sonolysis _ bands . tiff , then hit Save . Fig . 2 Representative grayscale gel image of intact polyethylene glycol bands with BaI 2 stain . The section of the gel in Fig . 1 where intact PEG bands reside was cropped and converted to grayscale image using ImageJ software . The rectangles highlighted in red that enclose an intact , non - degraded PEG band in each lane deﬁne the areas where pixel intensity proﬁle of the samples are analyzed and compared Detecting Polyethylene Glycol Sonolysis 155 l After all the rectangles are set in place around every band , press the “3” key or go to Analyze ! Gels ! Plot Lanes to generate an intensity proﬁle plot of each lane in the gel ( see Note 37 ) . l Save the intensity proﬁle plots of the gel , shown as Fig . 3 , using File ! Save as ! Tiff , and give it a ﬁle name such as Plots _ PEG _ sonolysis _ bands . tiff , then hit Save . Each proﬁle plot section in Fig . 3 represents the relative density of the contents of the band over each lane . The sections are arranged top to bottom on the proﬁle plot , corresponding to the lanes from left to right in the gel . Because there were seven lanes selected in Fig . 2 , there are seven sections in the proﬁle plot shown in Fig . 3 . Scroll the mouse wheel up - and - down to see the proﬁle plot Fig . 3 Quantifying intact PEG bands in non - sonicated and sonicated samples based on pixel intensity proﬁle plots . On the left , the pixel intensities of the selected areas ( shown as red rectangles in Fig . 2 that enclose the intact PEG band in each lane ) are plotted against gel electrophoresis direction , from top to bottom . The pixel intensity of a band is quantiﬁed as the background - corrected area under the peak in the pixel intensity proﬁle plot . In tabulated form on the right , the relative abundance of intact PEG in sonicated and non - sonicated samples is presented as peak area and as % of control where the amount of intact PEG in the non - sonicated sample in Lane 1 was set to 100 % 156 Ruhung Wang et al . corresponding to each lane from left - to - right in the gel image . The peaks in the proﬁle plots correspond to the dark bands in the grayscale gel image . Higher peaks represent darker bands . Wider peaks represent bands that cover a wider size range ( thicker bands ) on the original gel . 7 . Images of real gels are likely to have some background signal , so the peaks don’t reach down to the baseline of the proﬁle plot and appear to ﬂoat above the baseline of the proﬁle plot . It will be necessary to close off the peak before its size is measured : l Choose the Straight Line selection Tool from the ImageJ toolbar . l For each peak you want to analyze in the proﬁle plot , draw a line across the base of the peak to enclose the peak ( see Note 38 ) . l After each peak has been closed off at the base , select the Wand Tool from the ImageJ toolbar . l Move up to the top proﬁle plot section and click inside the peak with the Wand Tool ; the border of the selected peak area is highlighted in yellow . A “Results” window will pop up showing the measurement of the peak area . The ﬁrst column in the results table shows the order of the peaks clicked with the Wand , the second column ( Area ) shows the peak area measurement that indicates the overall pixel intensity of the peak . l Repeat this for each peak in order going down the proﬁle plot ( see Note 39 ) . 8 . When all of the peaks have been highlighted correctly , save the results by clicking File ! Save as in the Results window . Give it a ﬁle name and ﬁle type such as Results _ PEG _ sonolysis _ peaks . txt , in a “Text Tab delimited” format that can be opened with Microsoft Excel for data analysis ( see Note 40 ) . 9 . Set the pixel intensity value of a control non - sonicated PEG - containing polymer as 100 % and compare the values of sam - ples subjected to sonication for increasing time ; the relative levels of sonolytic degradation that has occurred in each sample can be readily assessed . 10 . A representative application of the method described above is shown in Fig . 4 where the sonolytic degradation of distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine - PEG - COOH ( DSPE - PEG - COOH ) was detected and quantiﬁed in a sample that also contained single - walled carbon nanotubes ( SWNTs ) . In the absence of sonication , the PEG portion of DSPE - PEG - COOH was evident in a single band that was near the dye front Detecting Polyethylene Glycol Sonolysis 157 after BaI 2 staining . Within 15 min of sonication the intensity of the band had visibly declined due to PEG sonolysis and continued to decline until it was almost absent by 360 min . 4 Notes 1 . Unpolymerized acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin and is absorbed through the skin . The effects of acrylamide are cumu - lative . Wear gloves while working and avoid direct contact through bare skin . 2 . SDS powder is harmful if inhaled and may cause respiratory irritation . Wear personal protective equipment , including gloves , clothing , and respiratory mask , to avoid breathing dust . 3 . After the isobutanol and water layers settle , the upper layer will be isobutanol and the lower layer will be water ; use the upper layer without disturbing the lower layer . 4 . Barium chloride is one of the most common water - soluble barium salts . It is toxic if swallowed or inhaled . Avoid contact with skin , eyes , and clothing and avoid breathing vapors and dust . Fig . 4 Sonolytic degradation of DSPE - PEG - COOH in the presence of SWNTs . 5 mg of SWNTs were sonicated in 10 mL of 0 . 35 mM DSPE - PEG - COOH for the indicated times . The samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE followed by BaI 2 staining and the stained bands are shown at the top of the ﬁgure . The gels were then scanned and the band intensities quantiﬁed using ImageJ software . The data are presented as % density relative to 0 min as a function of sonication time , shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure .

The latest version of ImageJ software can be downloaded from the ofﬁcial ImageJ site at http : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / , for initial installation or for upgrade .

In addition , ImageJ source code and extended plugins for speciﬁc applications are freely available in the public domain . 6 . Lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) , also known as lipoglycans and endotoxin , are large lipid - polysaccharide molecules found in the outer membrane of gram - negative bacteria and elicit strong immune responses in animals . Inactivation of possible endo - toxin contaminants is recommended when the ﬁnal material is to be used with cultured cells or intact animals . 7 . Sonolysis of PEG - containing polymers is concentration and temperature dependent . 8 . The temperature of the sonication bath is kept below 18 (cid:1) C throughout the sonication period . 9 . The position of the sample vial during sonication is a key variable in bath sonication [ 16 , 17 ] . 10 . Sonication power level and ultrasound frequency are critical factors that inﬂuence sonolytic damage [ 2 , 18 ] . There is an inverse relationship between frequency and the size of cavita - tion bubbles because larger bubbles generated at lower fre - quencies generally create more extreme heat and pressure when they implode [ 2 , 3 , 19 ] . Pluronic ® polymers were readily degraded upon bath sonication at 37 kHz or probe sonication at 20 kHz frequency , but no apparent degradation was observed when subjected to bath sonication at 80 kHz fre - quency with similar power level and duration [ 10 ] . 11 . The power delivered to the sonicator bath can be determined by measuring the change in bath temperature ( starting at 22 (cid:1) C ) as a function of sonication time , at room temperature without a cooling coil [ 17 ] . This method uses the equation P ¼ ( d T / d t ) (cid:3) M (cid:3) Cp , where P is the acoustic power ( W ) , T is the temperature ( K ) , t is time ( s ) , M is the mass of water ( 1400 g for this bath sonicator ) , and Cp is the speciﬁc heat capacity of water at 298 K ( 4 . 18 J / g K ) . The power measured by this approach was ~ 80 W for this sonication system [ 11 ] . 12 . Alumina ceramic back plates have the advantage that they transfer heat 40 times more rapidly than glass plates , which facilitates cooling . However , regular glass plates can be used instead of alumina plates . Clean away any dust and gel pieces adhering to the plates from previous use . Spray a small amount of ethanol and wipe with a clean Kimwipes to remove any watermarks . Detecting Polyethylene Glycol Sonolysis 159 13 . When less than the maximum number of gel sandwiches is needed , place an 8 cm (cid:3) 10 cm plastic or glass space - ﬁller behind the stack of gel sandwiches to ﬁll up the caster completely . 14 . The gel sandwich should not move after the caster is clamped . Add more space - ﬁller plastic or glass plates if needed . 15 . Oxygen inhibits polymerization of PAGE gels . Usually in pre - paring such gels a degassing step , using vacuum , is required ; however for the small size gels used here , this step is not needed . An isobutanol layer is added on the top of each gel to keep the gel levels the same and to prevent contact of the gel with oxygen in the air . Deliver the isobutanol slowly along the spacer at the side of the sandwich . Make certain the caster is level using a bubble level . 16 . Do NOT pour the excess acrylamide down the sink . The mixture will polymerize in the pipes and clog them . Wait until the mixture has polymerized in the 50 - mL tube , then discard in hazardous trash . This excess material is also a good indicator whether the gel has polymerized properly and is ready for the next step . 17 . The polymerized resolving gel should remain in place and inside the gel sandwiches even when the caster is upside - down . 18 . Instead of the standard 10 - well combs , 1 . 5 - mm thick 15 - well combs can also be used . More samples can be loaded in a single gel with 15 wells and the volume of each sample loaded per lane is also reduced by half ( 10 μ L or less needed ) , which conserves valuable samples . 19 . If acrylamide begins to ooze out when the ﬁrst comb is inserted , it has already started to polymerize and there is no need to continue with the rest of the gels . Thus , practice quickly inserting the combs before making the stacking gel solution . 20 . The gels will be good for up to a month if kept wet and refrigerated . Inspect the gel before use . If there are air bubbles in the gel or the gel has separated from the glass or alumina plate , discard the gel . 21 . If possible , remove the comb after the reservoir is ﬁlled with electrophoresis buffer , then work the comb out slowly by gently rocking it side to side while pulling it out . Be cautious of collapsing wells when removing the comb . If a well ( s ) has collapsed , use a micropipette tip to gently lift the collapsed walls back to a standing position . 22 . A constant current setting at 20 mA per gel is ﬁne to use . 160 Ruhung Wang et al . 23 . A pilot experiment should be performed to determine the migration of a PEG - containing polymer , intact and degraded , relative to the tracking blue dye after 1 h of electrophoresis . 24 . Cut a small notch on one corner to mark the orientation of the resolving gel before staining . 25 . Iodine is commonly used as a starch indicator to test for the presence of starch in foods , drugs , paper , textiles , and other products where iodine dissolved in an aqueous solution reacts with starch , resulting in an intensely purple - black colored complex . 26 . Wrap the iodine solution bottle with foil to protect from light . Wear gloves and a lab coat to protect skin and cloth from iodine stains . 27 . Speed up the de - staining step by using larger volumes and more frequent changes of water . Also , place the container on a shaker to agitate water over the gel , which helps to de - stain the gel more evenly . 28 . The iodine stain will fade over time in water . The best way to preserve the stain is to wrap the gel in plastic wrap with no excess water , place it ﬂat in a plastic bag or container together with a sheet of wet paper towel , and store at 4 (cid:1) C protected from light . If the gel is left in water too long and bands becomes too faint , the gel can be re - stained with iodine until all bands are saturated with BaI 2 stain again and then destain with water to remove background color . 29 . The ability to store image data in a lossless format makes a TIFF ﬁle a useful image archive , because , unlike standard JPEG or PGN ﬁles , a TIFF ﬁle using lossless compression ( or none ) may be edited and re - saved without losing image quality . 30 . The dominant bands in the gel shown in Fig . 1 correspond to the intact PEG band in lane 1 ( the non - sonicated PEG sample on the far - left lane ) and the sonicated bands in the other lanes ( lanes 2 – 7 ) to the right . 31 . To select the color of the rectangle go to Edit ! Option ! Colors , make a color selection from the list , and hit “OK” . 32 . Instead of crop , a copy of the selected area can be created using Image ! Duplicate . The copy is named in the “Title” box . Hit “OK” and a new window will open containing a copy of the selected area of the image . 33 . The brightness and Contrast of the gel image can be adjusted in ImageJ : l Choose Image ! Adjust ! Brightness / Contrast . A new window “B & C” will appear with a histogram of pixel intensity , displaying the range of pixels with the lowest intensity on the left and the highest on the right , and Detecting Polyethylene Glycol Sonolysis 161 with corresponding values listed on the bottom of the graph . The current pixel intensity distribution of the image is shown in four sliders for the minimum , maximum , brightness , and contrast ranges . l To make the bands look darker , by cutting off low - intensity pixels , slide the “Minimum” ( top ) slider to the right . This sets the bottom of the display range to a higher value than the previous display . l To make the bands look brighter , by cutting off high - intensity pixels , slide the “Maximum” ( second ) slider to the left . This sets the top of the display range to a lower value than before . l Adjusting the “Brightness” ( third ) slider changes both the top and the bottom intensity values displayed without changing the size of the range displayed . l Adjusting the “Contrast” ( fourth ) slider changes both the top and bottom brightness values and the size of the display range . l The “Auto” button chooses the best display range , based on a saturation of 0 . 35 % of the pixels in the image . l The “Reset” button acts as an undo button and resets the image to its original ( full ) display range . l The “Set” button allows the user to input values for the top and bottom of the display range with the option to propagate these values to all other images open in ImageJ . l None of the adjustments made to the Brightness and Con - trast of the image alter the histogram and the pixel inten - sity values of the image permanently until the “Apply” button is hit . 34 . ImageJ assumes that the lanes run vertically ( individual bands are horizontal ) , so the rectangle drawn should be tall and just narrow enough to enclose a single band . 35 . To select the color and font of the labels go to Image ! Over - lay ! Labels . A new window “Labels” will appear , in which color , font size , and other properties of the labels can be selected . Hit the “OK” button to accept the selections . 36 . If an error has been made in setting the size or the order of the rectangles , reset the rectangles using Analyze ! Gels ! Reset , and start it over from the ﬁrst lane . 37 . If it is desirable to have two plots to compare side - by - side , go to Analyze ! Gels ! Re - plot Lanes to reset the rectangles . 38 . This step requires some subjective judgment to decide where the peak ends and the background noise begins . 162 Ruhung Wang et al . 39 . If a mistake has been made when clicking with the Wand tool , such as clicking the area outside a peak , the program still records the pixel intensity of that clicked region , and it will report that value as an entry in the Results window . A quick ﬁx is to highlight the unwanted entry in the Results window , hit “Clear” under the “Edit” tab to erase it before clicking the next area with the Wand tool . To erase the whole set of measure - ments and reset the Results window counter , go to Analyze ! Gel ! Label Peaks , go back to the top of the proﬁle plot , and begin clicking inside the peaks again , starting with the ﬁrst peak in the ﬁrst section . The Results window should clear and begin showing new values . 40 . The values in the Results windows can be copied to a spread - sheet program , such as Microsoft Excel , by clicking Edit ! Select All to highlight all the values , followed by Edit ! Copy in the Results window . Go to an Excel spreadsheet , right - click and hit Paste , and the two columns of values will be transferred into Excel in the exact order .

Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko Abstract Laser pulse - induced vapor nanobubbles are nonstationary nanoevents that offer a broad range of applica - tions , especially in the biomedical ﬁeld . Plasmonic ( usually gold ) nanoparticles have the highest energy efﬁcacy of the generation of vapor nanobubbles and such nanobubbles were historically named as plasmonic nanobubbles . Below we review methods ( protocols ) for generating and detecting plasmonic nanobubbles in liquids . The biomedical applications of plasmonic nanobubbles include in vivo and in vitro detection and imaging , gene transfer , micro - surgery , drug delivery , and other diagnostic , therapeutic , and theranostic applications . Key words Laser , Vapor nanobubbles , Plasmonic nanobubble , Gold nanoparticles 1 Introduction The increasing need in multifunctional cellular agents that support a wide range of medical functions from the diagnosis to the surgery and to the therapy resulted in a new discipline named theranostics . Historically , most of theranostic solutions were supported with materials , often nanoparticles with multiple functions . However , the reality of their biological and clinical applications posed several fundamental challenges : l Nonspeciﬁc uptake of nanoparticles by nontarget cells and tissues creates toxicities and reduces the efﬁcacy , and requires increasing the dose of nanoparticles to achieve a desired effect . l Current biological functions of clinically safe nanoparticles appear to be limited and do not support a holy grail promise of nanomedicine in general . This is why , in our search for the ideal cell level nano - agent , we came to the concept of nano - events instead of nano - materials , and introduced plasmonic nanobubbles ( PNB ) , nonstationary Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 11 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 165 mechanical events at the nanoscale , nano - explosions in fact , to cover a wide spectrum of medical and nonmedical applications ( Table 1 ) . A plasmonic nanobubble is generated around light - absorbing ( usually plasmonic ) nanoparticle in liquid when the nanoparticle is exposed to a short laser pulse ( Fig . 1a ) through the chain of the physical processes : optical absorption—heating of the nanoparticle surface—heating and evaporation of adjacent liquid—vapor expansion and collapse . The Table 1 below outlines various applications and functions of PNBs , and basic requirements for their generation and detection . Next , the chapter below dis - cusses various scientiﬁc and methodological aspects of PNB gener - ation and detection . Finally , there is an application - speciﬁc example of the PNB generation protocol . The absorption of optical energy by micro - and nanoparticles in liquid , and the follow - up photothermal conversion and heating of the surrounding liquid induce vapor bubbles around such particles if the incident optical ﬂuence ( laser pulse energy per unit area ) exceeds a speciﬁc threshold [ 1 – 11 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . The energy efﬁcacy of vapor bubble generation increases when the particle - to - liquid heat transfer is localized and the bulk heating of liquid is mini - mized . This thermal conﬁnement is usually achieved by shortening the duration of the optical excitation to minimize thermal diffusion [ 12 ] . In the case of a nanoparticle , the duration of the optical excitation shortens to a nano - and pico - second range to prevent the bulk heating of the surrounding liquid [ 12 – 14 ] . This , in turn , makes the generation of a transient vapor nanobubble a highly nonstationary process [ 15 , 16 ] . The combination of the nano - size of the optical absorber with the drastic increase in the photothermal efﬁcacy of plasmonic nanoparticles ( compared to that of any molec - ular absorbers ) resulted in a new class of nano - events , plasmonic Table 1 Applications and functions of PNBs Field PNB generation PNB detection Application Physics , material science Laser pulse with the ﬂuence above PNB generation threshold Optical via the scatteringmechanism On - demand mechanical nano - impact or optical scattering , imaging of nanoparticles Biology Laser pulse with the application - speciﬁc ﬂuence Optical via the scattering mechanism Delivery of molecular cargo into target cell , on - demand mechanical impact in target cell , imaging of speciﬁc cells Medicine Near - infrared laser pulse with the application - speciﬁc ﬂuence Acoustic Diagnosis Drug and gene delivery Nano - surgery Combination chemo - and radiation therapy 166 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko nanobubbles ( PNBs ) —vapor nanobubbles , generated via the photothermal conversion around plasmonic nanoparticles [ 4 – 7 , 9 – 11 , 15 – 20 ] . The physical properties of PNBs were shown to be different both from those of the stationary photothermal effects of plasmonic nanoparticles under continuous optical excitation and of laser - induced vapor bubbles in liquid via the mechanisms of optical breakdown or homogeneous optical absorbance by liquid . The photothermal properties of nanoparticles under stationary excita - tion are determined by their preset properties , such as optical absorbance , which remain permanent during their optical excita - tion . In contrast , an intense short pulsed excitation of a metal nanoparticle during the generation of a PNB results in a rapid dynamic modiﬁcation of the optical absorbance , size , structure , and phase state of the nanoparticle [ 21 – 24 ] and results in entirely new optical , physical , and biomedical properties of PNB compared to those of plasmonic nanoparticles [ 16 , 22 ] . For example , com - pared to gold nanospheres with a broad excitation visible spectrum , Fig . 1 ( a ) The generation of plasmonic nanobubbles ( PNB ) : a gold nanoparticle ( GNP ) in liquid is exposed to a short laser pulse . Optical absorption results in rapid heating of the GNP and evaporation of adjacent liquid and a pressure build up inside a vapor . After this internal pressure in the vapor exceeds the external pressure , the vapor rapidly expands into a nanobubble , and then collapses back to the GNP . ( b ) A temporal sequence of the above - described processes involved into the generation of PNB [ 25 ] Plasmonic Nanobubbles 167 a gold nanosphere - generated PNB yields an ultra - narrow peak in near - infrared [ 16 , 25 ] . The photothermal generation of vapor bubbles in optically absorbing liquids involves extensive bulk heat - ing above the evaporation threshold temperature while the PNB , in contrast , thermally insulates the bulk liquid and thus maintains its temperature close to the ambient level [ 15 ] . The optical breakdown - induced vapor nanobubbles do not require signiﬁcant optical absorbance by the medium . However , an optical breakdown involves high local pressures and temperatures , and often shock waves , thus making it difﬁcult to precisely control the optical breakdown - generated vapor nanobubble [ 26 ] . The relatively high threshold of laser ﬂuence and intensity for optical breakdown limits biomedical applications of breakdown - generated nanobubbles . In contrast , PNBs demonstrated excellent biologic safety [ 16 , 20 ] because of their localized mechanical , nonthermal impact and low threshold energies down to 5 – 15 mJ / cm 2 [ 27 , 28 ] , which match even the federal laser safety standards [ 29 ] . The remote on - demand generation , precise control of their mechanical impact and easy optical and acoustic detection result in promising biomedical appli - cations of PNBs for diagnostics , therapy , and theranostics [ 9 , 20 , 26 – 28 , 30 – 34 ] and in various industrial applications [ 17 , 35 , 36 ] . However , the applications of PNB are still relatively limited compared to those of plasmonic nanoparticles or laser - induced vapor bubbles in liquids . This is largely caused by the lack of the universal methodology of PNB generation in real conditions . A PNB is not a particle but rather a transient nonstationary nano - event which results from several transient nanoscale processes at sub - nanosecond time scale ( Fig . 1b ) . Under excitation of a plas - monic nanoparticle with an ultra - short single laser , these processes include : photon - phonon - heat conversion , nanoparticle surface - to - liquid heat transfer , liquid evaporation , and vapor bubble expansion and collapse . The nonstationary nature of these processes , coupled with the dynamically changing optical and thermal properties of the nanoparticle under high ( melting ) temperatures , seriously compli - cates the modeling of PNBs , compared to the modeling of station - ary or low temperature photothermal effects . Experimental studies of PNBs at the nanoscale usually describe their properties under the speciﬁc duration of the excitation laser pulse and for the speciﬁc nanoparticle system . Such properties are difﬁcult to extrapolate into other laser pulse durations and nanoparticle systems . In addition , the majority of experimental models and protocols use nanoparticle ensembles , multiple laser pulses , and indirect detection of PNBs through their secondary cumulated effects . All these factors distort the understanding of the PNB’s generation mechanism . As a result , the practical use of PNBs remains rather challenging for a broad community . 168 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko 2 Generation of Plasmonic Vapor Nanobubbles Around Laser - Heated Gold Nanoparticles Here , we discuss the key factor for generation of the plasmonic nanobubbles , the duration of optical excitation , in the range from picosecond to continuous excitation . The discussed protocols employ various nanoparticle systems—from isolated nanoparticles ( solid gold nanospheres ( also known as colloids ) [ 37 ] ) to their suspensions and to large clusters of aggregated nanoparticles . 2 . 1 Initial Development of PNB To estimate how fast a vapor may develop at the surface of a 60 nm solid gold nanoparticle ( GNP ) , the GNP’s surface temperature dynamics were simulated in water in response to a single laser pulse . In simulations , the laser ﬂuence was ﬁxed at the level of 66 mJ / cm 2 , which is well above the threshold for generation of PNB . In this model , and for the initial stage of the GNP heating , we considered that the level of the optical absorbance cross - section of the GNP remained constant during its interaction with the laser pulse ( although at later stages it changed drastically due to the GNP heating and melting ) . We approximated the vapor onset tempera - ture by the critical temperature for water . This relatively high threshold ensures the onset of vapor near the GNP surface under any conditions . After this temperature level was achieved , we did not model the follow - up temperature dynamics because the laser - induced temperatures rapidly reach the GNP surface melting con - ditions and thus the GNP optical absorbance , structure , and size undergo radical dynamic changes [ 21 , 22 ] . All these dynamic changes cannot be easily incorporated into existing models . We deﬁned the vapor onset time t PNB ( Fig . 2a ) as the time interval from the beginning of the laser pulse ( at the laser intensity level 1 / e 2 ) to the time point when the GNP surface temperature reaches the vapor onset threshold . Naturally , the vapor onset time cannot be shorter than the GNP thermalization time which has been approximated by 5 ps [ 23 , 24 , 38 , 39 ] . The vapor onset time was analyzed as a function of the laser pulse duration from 20 ps to 14 ns ( black curve in Fig . 2b ) . We also considered continuous excitation as a separate case ( see below ) . The shortest pulses provided the shortest vapor onset times . Formally , vapor onset time was even shorter than the GNP thermalization time and was therefore approximated by the longer one , GNP thermalization time ( Fig . 2b ) . The vapor onset time grew with the duration of the laser pulse . We further deﬁned “the PNB energy” of the laser pulse as the percentage of the laser pulse energy which corresponds to the time interval from the vapor onset to the end of the laser pulse ( Fig . 2a ) . This “PNB energy” indicates the incident optical energy that can be utilized by a PNB . We analyzed this PNB energy as a function of the pulse duration ( red Plasmonic Nanobubbles 169 Fig . 2 ( a ) The calculated time - course of the temperature of gold 60 nm nanospheres in water ( red curve ) during the absorption of a single laser pulse at 532 nm ( pulse duration 20 ps ) with a Gaussian temporal proﬁle ( black curve ) with the ﬂuence of 66 mJ / cm 2 . ( b ) The calculated vapor onset time ( black curve ) and the portion 170 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko curve in Fig . 2b ) . For picosecond pulses , the vapor onset time was only a small fraction of the whole pulse duration and hence the level of PNB energy was relatively high . Longer pulses showed a decrease in the PNB energy due to the increased thermal losses for the bulk heating of the surrounding water . Finally , we estimated the vapor onset threshold ﬂuence which was deﬁned as the ﬂuence required to achieve the vapor onset temperature of the GNP surface ( Fig . 2c ) . The PNB’s threshold ﬂuence increased with the pulse duration , mainly due to the increased energy losses to the bulk heating of water . Thus , the modeled vapor onset time and the laser threshold ﬂuence were the lowest for the shortest pulses . In particular , for the picosecond pulses the pulse energy was almost totally utilized to generate the PNB . Next , we present the experi - mental studies of PNBs . 2 . 2 The Inﬂuence of the Laser Pulse Duration on the PNB Generation Around Isolated GNPs Under Resonant Optical Excitation To study the inﬂuence of the excitation pulse duration on PNB generation , the isolated GNPs were studied in water using single laser pulses at 532 nm , which is close to the wavelength of plasmon resonance in 60 nm GNPs . Individual GNPs and PNBs were imaged via our time - resolved optical scattering method ( Fig . 3a , b ) [ 19 ] . The maximal diameter of the expanding and collapsing individual PNB was quantiﬁed through the duration of its optical scattering time - response ( Fig . 3c ) [ 15 ] . This PNB metric was applied to characterize the energy efﬁcacy of PNB generation for a speciﬁc laser ﬂuence . Under the ﬁxed applied laser ﬂuence ( 66 mJ / cm 2 ) , PNBs were observed for all three picosecond pulse durations from 20 to 400 ps , but were not observed for the nanosecond pulses ( Fig . 3d ) . The maximum PNB lifetime ( and hence the maximum energy efﬁcacy of PNB generation ) was observed for the shortest pulse of 20 ps . Apparently , the applied ﬂuence , 66 mJ / cm 2 , was above the PNB generation threshold for 20 and 70 ps pulses , close to the threshold for the 400 ps pulse and below the threshold for the 14 ns pulse ( Fig . 3d ) . We next measured the PNB generation threshold ﬂuence as a function of the laser pulse duration ( red curve in Fig . 3d ) . The minimum threshold , which is less than 18 mJ / cm 2 , was observed for the shortest , 20 ps pulse . The 20 - fold increase in the pulse duration from 20 to 400 ps increased the threshold ﬂuence 6 . 4 - fold to 115 mJ / cm 2 , while for the nanosecond pulse , the PNB generation threshold ﬂuence increased by almost two orders of magnitude ( red curve in Fig . 3d ) . Thus , the laser pulse duration (cid:2) Fig . 2 ( Continued ) of the laser pulse energy ( red curve ) which corresponds to the portion of the pulse after the vapor onset as a function of the laser pulse duration at 532 nm wavelength and ﬂuence of 66 mJ / cm 2 . ( c ) The calculated PNB’s generation threshold ﬂuence as a function of laser pulse duration at 532 nm wavelength . Reprinted from [ 25 ] Plasmonic Nanobubbles 171 radically inﬂuences both the energy efﬁcacy and the threshold ﬂuence of PNB generation . These experimental results qualitatively agree with the above simulations . Quantitatively , the experimentally observed PNB gen - eration thresholds were higher than the estimated values . This dis - agreement may be caused by several factors that were not taken into account in the theoretical model , but they reduced the efﬁciency of PNB generation . Namely , our model did not account for the addi - tional energy required to ( 1 ) overcome the surface tension pressure ( which is very high for isolated 60 nm GNPs ) , ( 2 ) evaporate a speciﬁc volume of liquid for the formation of a PNB , and ( 3 ) compensate a substantial dynamic decrease in the optical absorbance of a GNP during its interaction with the laser pulse . The latter effect is caused by ( 1 ) vapor around the GNP that signiﬁcantly changes the dielectric functions of gold and , hence , reduces optical absorbance at the resonance wavelength [ 40 ] , ( 2 ) extensive heating , melting and size reduction of the GNP [ 22 , 41 – 46 ] , and ( 3 ) additional scattering of the incident excitation laser beam by the vapor – water boundary [ 15 ] . All these factors were not taken into account in our model and might explain the almost one order of magnitude difference between the theoretical and experimental PNB generation threshold ﬂuences . A more accurate theoretical prediction of the threshold ﬂuences requires a fairly complex computational methodology that is capable , in particular , of connecting the heat and mass transfer processes in and around a GNP with the dynamic variation of its optical absorbance . So far , such models do not exist . In addition , the detection limit of an individual PNB in our experiments might have been relatively high , above 200 nm , and thus the smallest PNBs ( generated under the lower ﬂuences ) might have been missed .

Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko Nevertheless , the above experimental data were based on the direct detection of individual PNBs and therefore they correctly describe the inﬂuence of the laser pulse duration on the PNB generation threshold and energy efﬁcacy . To summarize , short picosecond pulses provide the best energy efﬁcacy of photothermal PNB gener - ation , while the use of popular nanosecond lasers may require a 100 - fold increase in the laser energy . 2 . 3 GNP Ensembles vs . Isolated Particles The isolated GNPs studied above are not typical for real - world photothermal applications , where GNPs are used in the form of suspensions or / and aggregated clusters . For example , active bio - targeting of GNPs results in their intracellular clustering [ 20 , 47 , 48 ] . Many industrial applications employ suspensions of GNPs [ 17 , 35 , 36 ] . We therefore studied the PNB lifetimes ( a metric of the energy efﬁcacy of PNB generation ) as a function of the cluster size for isolated GNP clusters ( Fig . 4 ) and the con - centration for GNP suspension ( Fig . 5 ) under a speciﬁc level of the laser ﬂuence , 66 mJ / cm 2 , above PNB generation threshold ﬂu - ence . The excitation wavelength of 532 nm was close to that of the plasmon resonance for the 60 nm solid spheres employed . Based on our previous results , we used the most efﬁcient 20 ps pulse . GNP clusters in water were formed via the salt - driven aggregation of GNPs . The relative size of each individual GNP cluster was quanti - ﬁed via the pixel amplitude of its optical scattering image ( Fig . 4a ) . The PNB lifetime was measured for individual clusters in response to a single laser pulse ( Fig . 4c ) . The PNB lifetime increased with the GNP cluster size almost linearly and exceeded that of a single GNP Fig . 4 Generation of PNBs around isolated GNP clusters in water under resonant excitation with 20 ps laser pulse at 532 nm [ 25 ] . ( a ) Optical scattering time - resolved images of a GNP cluster in water and ( b ) a PNB generated around the same cluster in single 20 ps pulse excitation at 532 nm . ( c ) The energy efﬁcacy of PNB generation ( measured via the lifetime of individual PNBs at 66 mJ / cm 2 , black curve ) and the PNB generation threshold ﬂuence ( red curve ) as functions of the GNP cluster size ( quantiﬁed via the pixel amplitude of the optical scattering image of a GNP cluster ) Plasmonic Nanobubbles 173 by approximately ﬁvefold ( black curve in Fig . 4c ) . This signiﬁcant increase in PNB generation efﬁcacy of the cluster vs . isolated GNP under identical laser ﬂuence can be explained by : ( 1 ) the enhance - ment of plasmonic properties and the increased optical absorbance of the cluster [ 22 ] , and ( 2 ) the coalescence of the initial vapors around GNPs into the joint vapor blanket around the whole clus - ter , which increases the bubble radius and hence reduces the surface tension pressure [ 15 ] . The clustering of GNPs also resulted in an almost fourfold decrease in the PNB threshold ﬂuence compared to that for an isolated single GNP ; from 18 to 5 mJ / cm 2 ( red curve in Fig . 4c ) . This effect provides a unique opportunity to selectively generate PNBs only around the largest GNP clusters at the mini - mum laser ﬂuence , and without generating PNBs around single unclustered GNPs or their small clusters . In biomedical applica - tions , this cluster size effect allows a dramatic improvement in the target cell speciﬁcity of PNBs compared to that of GNPs [ 20 ] . For water suspensions of unclustered single GNPs , we observed multiple PNBs under a single pulse excitation ( Fig . 5a ) . These multiple PNBs were generated synchronously and were ana - lyzed through an integrated optical scattering time - response ( Fig . 5b ) . A PNB lifetime has been averaged over ten responses obtained from ten different areas of the suspension . An increase in the GNP concentration by four orders of magnitude increased the PNB lifetime from 4 to 280 ns ( black curve in Fig . 5c ) and at the same time caused an almost fourfold decrease in the PNB threshold ﬂuence ( red curve in Fig . 5c ) . Even at the maximum GNP concen - tration , the PNB generation threshold in suspension ( 20 mJ / cm 2 ) was signiﬁcantly higher than that for individual GNP clusters ( 5 mJ / cm 2 ) . Therefore , GNP clusters provided higher energy efﬁ - cacy of the PNB generation compared to that for GNP suspensions . The effects of GNP clustering contribute to the PNB genera - tion and detection in suspension . Firstly , in experiments with GNP Fig . 5 Generation of PNBs in water suspension of single GNPs under resonant excitation with 20 ps laser pulse at 532 nm [ 25 ] . ( a ) Optical scattering time - resolved image of PNBs generated at laser ﬂuence of 66 mJ / cm 2 . Scale bar : 5 μ m . ( b ) Illustration of the typical time - response of the PNBs . ( c ) The energy efﬁcacy of PNB generation ( measured via the lifetime of individual PNBs at 66 mJ / cm 2 , black curve ) and the PNB generation threshold ﬂuence ( red curve ) as functions of the GNP concentration in the suspension 174 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko suspension , the maximum GNP concentration studied corresponds to the averaged distance between individual GNPs in the order of 1 μ m . This distance is comparable with the maximum size of PNBs and may cause a coalescence of several PNBs in a larger one with a longer lifetime . Secondly , an increase in GNP concentration increases the probability of a single GNP being exposed to a laser pulse . In our conditions , the probability of PNB generation in suspension at the low concentration was less than 1 . This inﬂuenced the averaging of the PNB lifetime over 10 pulses that were applied to the different areas of the suspension . The increase in the GNP concentration increased the PNB generation probability and , accordingly , the average lifetime . Thirdly , at high GNP concentra - tions the PNB generation probability becomes equal to 1 and a further increase in the PNB lifetime is caused by the increase in the number of simultaneously generated PNBs whose integrated opti - cal scattering effect was detected as a single time - response of a longer duration compared to that from a single PNB ( in addition to the mentioned above effect of coalescence of several small PNBs into one large PNB at high GNP concentration ) . These three effects explain the inﬂuence of the GNP concentration upon the PNB generation energy efﬁcacy and threshold . Therefore , the GNP suspension does not correctly describe the PNB generation mecha - nism for individual GNPs . Among three GNP systems studied , single GNPs , suspensions of GNPs , and clusters of tightly aggre - gated GNPs , the latter showed the highest PNB generation efﬁcacy . 2 . 4 Continuous Optical Excitation To model the PNB generation under continuous optical excitation , we estimated the thermal response of an isolated GNP to continu - ous wave ( c . w . ) laser excitation at 532 nm under the same optical dose ( ﬂuence ) as employed above for the pulsed excitation . Under the same optical dose ( ﬂuence ) as employed above for the pulsed excitation , the PNB threshold temperature could not be achieved due to intense thermal losses . In this model , the duration of optical excitation was 1 s . The estimated threshold ﬂuence turned out to be nine orders of magnitude higher ; 2 (cid:1) 10 9 mJ / cm 2 . Experimental studies of isolated GNPs in water under these conditions , which are identical to those described in second section for the pulsed excita - tion , resulted in no detectible PNBs in the range of the laser intensities below 2 MW / cm 2 and the duration of excitation up to 20 s ( ﬂuences of up to 4 (cid:1) 10 7 J / cm 2 ) . The GNP suspensions at the highest concentration of 10 12 GNP per mL also did not return any detectable PNBs under the c . w . excitation at this laser intensity and for a duration as long as 60 s . When the GNP suspension was replaced by individual large ( microscopically visible ) GNP clusters ( Fig . 6a ) , a microscopic PNB was detected after 30 s of excitation at laser intensity of 2 MW / cm 2 ( Fig . 6b ) . As the excitation was continued , PNBs grew from micro to almost macro size almost linearly with the time ( Fig . 6c ) . For Plasmonic Nanobubbles 175 isolated GNP clusters , the PNB generation threshold ﬂuence decreased with the cluster size ( Fig . 6d ) , which was similar to what was observed under pulsed excitation ( Fig . 4c ) . The above results show that the c . w . generation of PNBs requires multi - order increase in optical ﬂuence compared to the pulsed excitation , and in many cases cannot be achieved at all . The vapor onset times under continuous excitation are associated with a thermal diffusion radius of 12 mm ( for thermal diffusion from a spherical GNP [ 15 ] ) , which is four orders of magnitude larger than the maximum size of a GNP cluster , and more than ﬁve orders of magnitude larger than the size of an individual GNP . This spatial scale characterizes the size of the water volume heated by a GNP and clearly indicates that the c . w . laser excitation results in the bulk heating of water . In contrast , the PNB generation under short pulse excitation involves heating and evaporation of the water within several nanometers from the GNP surface and does not affect the bulk water temperature as we previously observed [ 15 ] . The PNB generation under c . w . laser excitation , therefore , is achieved through a bulk thermal impact on the surrounding media , while the pulsed nonstationary excitation results in the localized mechan - ical , nonthermal impact of a rapidly expanding and collapsing PNB which , in addition , thermally insulates the bulk media from the laser - heated GNP [ 15 ] . This difference makes the c . w . generation of PNBs similar to the laser - induced generation of vapor bubbles in an optically absorbing homogeneous liquid . Therefore , the advan - tage of plasmonic nanoparticles over optically absorbing liquids is achieved only under a short pulse excitation . In this case , the high optical absorbance of plasmonic nanoparticles efﬁciently supports the localized heating of the surrounding liquid above the Fig . 6 Continuous excitation of PNBs [ 25 ] .

( c ) Dependence of the PNB diameter upon continuous excitation time ( 532 nm ) , the change in the slope occurs when the bubble diameter reaches 0 . 12 mm , the height of the cuvette , after that , the bubble growth is basically two - dimensional . ( d ) PNB generation threshold ﬂuence at continuous excitation of PNB upon the GNP cluster size quantiﬁed via the pixel image amplitude of the optical absorbance of a GNP cluster 176 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko vaporization threshold . Longer , especially continuous , optical exci - tation of plasmonic nanoparticles in three - dimensional liquids delocalizes the thermal effect from nano - to macro - scale . In this case , any advantage of the nanosize of optical absorbers is lost , as well as the energy efﬁcacy , and the suspension of plasmonic nano - particles in transparent liquids becomes almost equal to the homogenous solution of optically absorbing liquids . In a case of planar and thermally isolated surface , the continuous excitation of GNPs [ 49 ] still may provide some localization of thermal effect . However , it cannot support the generation of a PNB because the latter is a three - dimensional phenomenon . 2 . 5 Off - Resonant Excitation In addition to the generation of PNBs at the wavelength near the peak of plasmon resonance , we studied PNB generation at off - resonant near - infrared wavelengths in the range of 700 – 800 nm , far from a stationary plasmon resonance . Colloidal gold is consid - ered to have a poor optical absorbance in this spectral range , about 1 % of that at the resonance wavelength at 530 – 540 nm [ 16 ] . The off - resonant excitation of isolated GNPs with a 20 ps pulse revealed an ultra - narrow , just 3 nm wide , peak at 782 nm ( Fig . 7a ) . For gold colloids used in this experiment , the spectral width of the optical absorption spectrum was about 100 nm . Under identical laser ﬂuence , the PNB lifetimes at 782 and 532 nm were close , thus implying that the levels of optical absorbance of GNPs at 532 and 782 nm are similar . Interestingly , we observed a similar effect for longer pulses [ 16 ] . This effect is very unusual for gold colloids and has never been observed under c . w . excitation of gold nanoparti - cles . We therefore studied how this off - resonant effect depends upon the duration of the near - infrared laser pulse ( Fig . 7b ) . At a ﬁxed laser ﬂuence , 66 mJ / cm 2 , the PNB lifetime rapidly dropped with the pulse length and no PNBs were observed for 400 ps and 14 ns pulses . Compared to resonant excitation ( Fig . 3d ) , this unusual near - infrared peak was limited only to short picosecond pulses . It was impossible to induce PNBs with pulses longer than 70 ps under laser ﬂuences up to 300 mJ / cm 2 . We further theoretically estimated the GNP surface tempera - ture dynamics at 780 nm , and determined the vapor onset times using the similar simulation approach as described above for the resonant excitation ( Fig . 7c ) . Next , based on the published data for similar GNPs [ 3 , 4 , 7 , 28 , 50 ] we estimated that the actual expan - sion of a PNB does not begin simultaneously with the onset of the laser pulse ( Fig . 1b ) and may be delayed by at least 50 ps . We therefore used the time window from the vapor onset to the begin - ning of the active expansion of the PNB to estimate the percentage of the pulse energy that corresponds to this off - resonant PNB and determined the “off - resonant PNB energy” ( Fig . 7c ) . Based upon similar calculations , this off - resonant PNB energy exceeded zero only for the short picosecond pulses of 20 and 70 ps ( red curve in Plasmonic Nanobubbles 177 Fig . 7 Off - resonant generation of PNBs around isolated individual GNPs in water obtained for 60 nm gold spheres irradiated by the 20 ps laser pulse at ﬂuence 178 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko Fig . 7b ) . Interestingly , the pulse duration functions of the esti - mated off - resonant PNB energy and the experimentally measured PNB lifetime were very close ( Fig . 7b ) . To explain this high off - resonant photothermal efﬁcacy of gold colloids under short pulse excitation , we previously hypothesized that a new transient plas - monic structure may emerge and exist during this short time win - dow and this structure transiently develops a high and narrow peak of optical absorbance at 782 nm [ 16 ] . This hypothetical transient plasmonic structure may include hot melted gold droplets in a vapor near the surface of the parent GNP . The system of metal droplets , vapor , and the parent GNP surface may have a high optical absorbance similar to a plasmonic grating and thus efﬁciently convert the near - infrared pulse into a PNB . As a PNB actively expands , it mechanically destroys this structure . The coincidence of the experimental and theoretical data in Fig . 7b supports the hypothesized transient nature of such plasmonic structure . Its ultra - narrow , 3 nm wide , peak of optical absorbance has never been reported for any isolated plasmonic structures . Furthermore , this peak is practically forbidden by elec - trodynamic theory , which allows for narrow spectral peaks in optical absorbance only for regular arrays and layers of plasmonic materials [ 51 – 54 ] . This novel , nonstationary plasmonic effect requires fur - ther in - depth studies . Nevertheless , it opens new opportunities for practical applications of plasmonic nanoparticles under “nonsta - tionary plasmonics” and radically improves the spectral selectivity and photothermal efﬁcacy of gold colloids at wavelengths where such properties cannot be achieved under stationary plasmonic conversion . In the generation of PNBs , there was a nine order of magnitude difference in the energy efﬁcacy and threshold of the PNB genera - tion with the variation of the duration of the optical excitation of plasmonic nanoparticles from picosecond pulses to continuous excitation . In addition , there was a strong dependence of the PNB generation parameters upon the nanoparticle state : isolated , suspension , or clustered . Finally , there was a nonstationary off - resonant excitation of plasmonic nanoparticles at the wavelengths where the stationary optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles formally exclude any efﬁcient photothermal response . Naturally , other parameters of plasmonic nanoparticles inﬂuenced the PNB generation . The inﬂuence of the GNP size on the PNB generation (cid:2) Fig . 7 ( Continued ) 66 mJ / cm 2 [ 25 ] .

The shaded area of the pulse shows the time window that determines the fraction of the laser pulse deﬁned as an “off - resonant PNB energy” Plasmonic Nanobubbles 179 was extensively analyzed by us previously [ 15 , 20 ] . Generally , the solid spheres of a smaller size or larger than 200 nm required more ﬂuence to generate identical PNBs under the resonant excitation [ 15 ] . The results obtained here for 60 nm gold colloids are fairly representative of GNPs of other diameter because the variation of the nanoparticle size in a wide range from 10 to 250 nm resulted in less than one order of magnitude variation in the PNB generation energy efﬁcacy and threshold [ 15 , 55 ] . The shape and structure of the GNPs of similar size also inﬂuenced the PNB generation energy efﬁcacy and threshold ﬂuence by less than one order of magnitude [ 28 , 30 , 48 ] . Therefore , the duration of the optical excitation appeared to be the most critical factor in the photothermal genera - tion of PNB compared to the GNP properties . PNB generation follows the several universal rules : l A PNB can be generated around a plasmonic nanoparticle using both pulsed nonstationary and continuous stationary optical excitation . l The maximum energy efﬁcacy of the photothermal generation of PNB is achieved with picosecond laser pulses , while the minimum energy efﬁcacy is associated with continuous optical excitation which requires up to nine orders of magnitude more energy to generate plasmonic nanobubble , compared to pico - second laser pulses . l The clusters of aggregated nanoparticles provide the maximal energy efﬁcacy of PNB generation compared to isolated nano - particles or their suspensions . l For short laser pulses , generation of PNBs does not cause bulk heating of surrounding liquid , while continuous optical excita - tion of plasmonic nanoparticles results in an opposite effect of signiﬁcant bulk heating of surrounding liquid . l Short picosecond off - resonant near - infrared optical excitation of gold colloids results in efﬁcient generation of plasmonic nanobubbles at a speciﬁc wavelength and in a very narrow , nanometers - wide , spectral interval around 780 nm . 3 Detection of Plasmonic Vapor Nanobubbles We analyze three protocols ( techniques ) that employ optical scat - tering and acoustic detection in identifying and quantifying indi - vidual photothermally induced plasmonic vapor nanobubbles at a wide range of excitation energies . In optically transparent media , the best quantitative detection can be achieved by measuring the duration of the optical scattering time - response , while in an opaque media , the amplitude of the acoustic time - response well describes PNBs in the absence of stress waves . 180 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko The science and the methods for the detection of inertial vapor bubbles of various origins were well developed for macro - and micro - sized bubbles and mainly employ their ability to emit pres - sure and to scatter the incident light [ 1 , 15 , 18 , 19 , 28 , 55 – 69 ] . Recent developments in nanoscience reduced the spatial and tem - poral scale of vapor bubbles to nanometers and nanoseconds . Unlike their larger analogs , vapor nanobubbles require much higher sensitivity and resolution of the detection methods for their imaging , quantiﬁcation , and identiﬁcation among other phe - nomena such as transient heating and the generation of stress waves . Here we analyze several experimental techniques for the imaging and quantitative analysis of transient vapor nanobubbles as single events and we troubleshoot some related errors . Due to the multiple biomedical applications of PNBs and related phenom - ena , it should be noted that we consider the transient events , but not the materials ( particles ) that are often also called nanobubbles [ 70 , 71 ] . We also do not consider the cavitation of preexisting bubbles that is well studied elsewhere [ 72 ] . 3 . 1 PNB Model While PNBs may have various sources of energy ( the heating of liquid above the boiling threshold , local rarefaction , and plasma discharge ) , we employed an experimental model of a single PNB in water . Such a model provides maximal precision , control , and reproducibility in PNB generation through the localized transient photothermal heating of liquid above the evaporation point . This was achieved through the optical excitation of individual 60 nm gold nanospheres in water with single short laser pulses ( 70 ps , 532 nm ) at speciﬁc ﬂuences above the PNB generation threshold . We used the plasmonic conversion of optical energy into heat to control the maximal diameter and lifetime of the PNBs through the ﬂuence of a single laser pulse , as described in details previously [ 15 , 18 , 19 , 28 , 55 ] . This experimental model includes an internal metal nanoparticle that acts as the source of the bubble energy during bubble generation and prevents the development of extreme tem - peratures and sonoluminescence ( the emission of short bursts of light from imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited by sound ) at the collapse stage , unlike “classical” bubbles that are generated in homogeneous media . Another important difference in the model employed is the absence of an external acoustic ﬁeld that is often used alone or in combination with optical energy to generate a vapor bubble . The above conditions and the nanoscale size resulted in a single cycle of the vapor nanobubble that did not oscillate . 3 . 2 Methods and Protocols of PNB Detection First , we consider imaging methods . Optical scattering phenomena allow both PNB imaging and monitoring of PNB’s dynamics . Direct imaging of slower and larger macro - and micro - bubbles employed different cameras and light sources . There is the possibil - ity of using a continuous light source and of capturing a short Plasmonic Nanobubbles 181 transient PNB with high - speed image detectors . However , that would require a nanosecond gating speed , sub - micron spatial reso - lution , and the corresponding high optical sensitivity . Dynamic transmission electron microscopy and time - resolved diffraction of X - rays can even better provide direct imaging of the dynamics of a PNB . Unfortunately , the cost and technical complexity of such solutions turn them into unique tools with very limited availability . Alternatively , the imaging of a transient PNB can also be rea - lized with much more affordable equipment using slow cameras and pulsed light sources ( Fig . 8a ) providing : 1 . Pulsed illumination with a shorter duration than a PNB lifetime within a nano - and pico - second range . 2 . Sufﬁcient energy of the optical pulse to compensate the very small scattering cross - section of the PNB . 3 . Precise synchronization of the illuminating pulse with the PNB source . These requirements suggest using a pulsed laser as the illumi - nation source . The illumination angle and the numerical aperture of the collecting lens further determine the signal - to - noise ratio of this imaging scheme . Forward scattering results in the maximal scattering efﬁcacy but cannot be fully separated from incident light that creates a high background . We achieved the best results with angled side illumination ( Fig . 8a ) , providing that the numeri - cal aperture of the imaging ( collecting ) lens is lower than the angle of incidence of the illuminating radiation . In this case , the lens collects only the light scattered by the PNB . This scheme allows the imaging of a single transient PNB with a lifetime down to 10 ns Fig . 8 Methods for detecting vapor nanobubbles in liquid [ 10 ] . ( a ) Optical time - resolved scattering imaging is obtained with a short probe laser pulse and a slow image detector ; ( b ) optical scattering ( extinction ) time - response is obtained with a continuous focused probe laser pulse and a fast photodetector ; ( c ) acoustical time - response is obtained with an ultrasound detector 182 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko ( Fig . 9a ) [ 10 ] . Most of the current CCD - and CMOS - based cam - eras can do such imaging . We used Andor Luka EMCCD ( charged coupled device with electronic multiplication ) and Cannon 50D ( equipped with a CMOS sensor ) stock cameras , both with long exposure times in the dark , to avoid precise synchronization with Fig . 9 ( a ) Three methods of detecting a single PNB . ( I ) Typical optical scattering ( extinction ) time - response obtained with continuous probe laser shows the expansion and collapse of the PNB ( metrics—amplitude and duration ) and time - resolved optical scattering imaging ( insert ) with a pulsed probe laser ( metric—a pixel image amplitude ) . ( II ) Typical acoustical time - response obtained with an ultrasound sensor ( metric— amplitude ) . ( b ) The same signals obtained for several simultaneously generated PNBs of different maximal diameter . ( c ) Inﬂuence of the experimental settings : ( I ) The diameter of the continuous probe beam is increased by 10 – 15 % and the angle of incidence of the pulsed probe beam increased from 45 (cid:3) to 135 (cid:3) ; ( II ) The resonance frequency of the acoustic sensor is decreased from 10 to 5 MHz . Corresponding signals as shown in ( a ) are shown with dashed lines . Scale bar is 15 μ m . Reproduced from [ 10 ] Plasmonic Nanobubbles 183 the PNB excitation laser pulse . In this method , the pixel image amplitude is used as a PNB metric , but it is not very practical because : ( 1 ) any deviation in the alignment of the probe beam would require recalibration of the system , and ( 2 ) this metric will not characterize the maximal diameter of a PNB when one ﬁxed time delay is applied . The advantage of this method is in the relatively precise identiﬁcation of a PNB and its location . It also shows the number of PNBs if multiple events occur ( Fig . 9b ) . The maximal diameter of a PNB is the most important param - eter that also characterizes the amount of energy received by the bubble . It can be measured with another optical scattering tech - nique that employs the monitoring of the intensity of a continuous probe beam with a broadband high - speed photodetector . The beam is focused at the PNB and its scattering by the PNB changes its axial intensity which is measured as a time - response with the photodetector . In one method , the beam is pointed at the low noise detector through the aperture and produces a high base level ( Fig . 8b ) . A PNB scatters the light and thus increasingly reduces the axial intensity of the probe beam during its expansion stage and brings it back to the base level during its collapse stage . This results in the bubble - speciﬁc shape of the time - response ( Fig . 9a panel I ) . Technically , the detector measures the optical extinction of the probe beam , but since a PNB does not absorb any optical energy , the extinction becomes equal to its scattering component . Due to the scattering nature of such signals they were deﬁned as “scatter - ing” [ 10 ] . This deﬁnition assumes the absence of any transient optical absorbance developed simultaneously with a PNB . If such absorbance emerges ( due to plasma formation or any nonlinear modiﬁcation of the optical properties of the media ) , the method ( protocol ) may characterize a PNB incorrectly [ 73 , 74 ] . In another method , the beam is pointed off the detector aperture and pro - duces a low base level at the detector . In this case , only the light scattered by a PNB will reach the detector and will increase its output signal , also producing a time - response with a bubble - speciﬁc shape [ 10 ] . The most precise way to measure the maximal diameter of a single PNB is to measure the duration of the PNB - speciﬁc signal ( Fig . 9a panel I ) which was shown to correlate to its maximal diameter [ 10 , 15 , 18 , 19 , 28 , 55 ] . The amplitude of the PNB response also depends upon the maximal diameter of the PNB , but is very sensitive to experimental factors that are difﬁcult to control . The ﬁrst is the diameter and divergence of the probe beam at the PNB’s plane . The smaller the beam waste , the higher the sensitivity of PNB detection . An increase in the beam’s diameter by 10 – 15 % and / or a slight deviation of the beam axis may cause a several - fold decrease in the signal amplitude of a dip - shaped PNB signal ( Fig . 9c panel I ) . Such conditions occur during changing the sample chamber or while scanning a heterogeneous sample across 184 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko the beam . The simultaneous generation of multiple PNBs around different sources of thermal energy ( for example , in suspension around optically absorbing molecules or nanoparticles ) instead of a single one , increases the signal amplitude , but such an increase is just an ensemble effect ( Fig . 9b panel I ) . The simultaneous genera - tion of several PNBs of different maximal sizes inﬂuences not only the amplitude but also the shape of the PNB time - response ( Fig . 9b panel I ) . Smaller PNBs form a sharp front and fewer large PNBs form a long tail of lower amplitude . While the generation of PNBs under some settings may typically involve such a multi - PNB pat - tern , it is still possible to estimate the lifetime of the largest PNB ( s ) that represent the maximal deposition of the thermal energy by measuring the duration of the time - response at the reduced level instead of at half of maximum [ 10 ] . However , the best rule is to avoid such distorted signals because they may lead to misinterpre - tation of the bubble parameters [ 73 ] . In all three considered cases ( single PNB , single PNB with misaligned probe beam , multiple PNBs ) the durations of the bubble - speciﬁc signals could be linked to the maximal diameter of the PNB ( or the largest PNB as in Fig . 9b panel I ) , while their amplitudes differed signiﬁcantly and therefore , their use as PNB metrics may lead to artifacts [ 74 ] . The third method of PNB detection employs the pressure waves generated during the bubble expansion and collapse ( Fig . 8c ) [ 10 ] . In the case of a single inertial bubble , the pressure and rarefaction waves produce a typical signal ( Fig . 9a panel II ) . This is deﬁnitely the simplest and the least expensive method of the three , because it does not require expensive optical sources , optics , and sensors . In addition , it detects PNBs in optically opaque media , so it is probably the most universal of the methods . The most obvious metric of the acoustic signal is its maximal ( peak - to - peak ) amplitude . However , the correct identiﬁcation and measurement of a PNB with a standard acoustic detector can be challenging in a single - pulse mode . Most detectors have a resonant frequency that is less than or equal to 10 MHz where their sensitivity is maximal . For small PNBs with lifetimes from 5 to 100 ns , the corresponding pressure rise times and associated frequencies seem to be higher than the resonant frequencies of most acoustic sensors . Therefore , the sensor signal does not show the real pressure , but rather repre - sents a response function of the sensor . In this case the amplitude of the output signal of the acoustic sensor signiﬁcantly depends upon its resonant frequency and may cause a signiﬁcant error ( Fig . 9c panel II ) . For a speciﬁc acoustic sensor , the amplitude of its output also depends upon the number of simultaneously generated PNBs ( Fig . 9b panel II ) . Therefore , a reliable measurement of the PNB diameter through the amplitude of acoustic response assumes that a single PNB is generated . The next important task is the identiﬁcation of a PNB and its discrimination from other phenomena such as transient heating or Plasmonic Nanobubbles 185 stress waves ( Fig . 10 ) . The optical scattering response identiﬁes heating through a thermal lens effect that allows the detection and measurement of rapid heating and gradual cooling due to thermal diffusion ( Fig . 10a ) [ 10 ] . This purely refractive effect does not produce any optical scattering like a PNB does . Next , under high transient temperatures at short time scales , the genera - tion of stress waves ( and shock waves ) also inﬂuences the refractive index of the media and creates a distinct short ( relative to the Fig . 10 Illustrations of typical optical scattering ( or extinction ) ( left ) and acoustic ( right ) time - responses of three different phenomena [ 10 ] : ( a ) transient heating of the gold nanoparticle and the media with a single laser pulse at a ﬂuence below the PNB generation threshold ; ( b ) single transient vapor nanobubble ; ( c ) PNB accompanied by a stress wave that produces a sharp and short optical signal in the very beginning of the time - response 186 Ekaterina Y . Lukianova - Hleb and Dmitri O . Lapotko bubble and heating time scale ) signal of nanosecond duration that is determined by the speed of sound and the aperture of the probe beam ( Fig . 10c ) . Both phenomena can be clearly distinguished from the bubble ( Fig . 10b ) . However , all these three different phenomena do not much inﬂuence the shape of the acoustic response , but rather its amplitude ( Fig . 10 ) , which is minimal for heating , increases for a bubble and becomes the maximal for stress waves [ 10 ] . Therefore , an acoustic time - response is much less bubble - speciﬁc than an optical scattering time - response . The above analysis compares three protocols for the detection of PNBs under ﬁxed excitation conditions . However , in reality the generation of PNBs may occur in a wide range of excitation ﬂuences from pulse to pulse and even within the aperture of a single pulse . These factors cause a wide variation in the maximal diameter of the PNB . Therefore , it is important to understand the range of the linear correlation between the PNB metric and its excitation con - ditions that determine the PNB’s maximal diameter . We compared the four metrics discussed above , the pixel amplitude of the scatter - ing image , the amplitude and duration of the optical scattering time response and the amplitude of the acoustic response , as functions of the ﬂuence of the excitation laser pulse , the parameter that in this model , determines the maximal diameter of the PNB when the ﬂuence exceeds the PNB generation threshold . All bubbles can be generated in water around individual identical gold nanospheres . This model provides a very precise deposition and conversion of optical energy into a bubble . Three types of signals , optical response , image , and acoustical response can be obtained simulta - neously for each individual event . For the scattering image , we observed the relatively early satu - ration and nonlinear behavior of the pixel image amplitude com - pared to the duration of the time response . Time - resolved scattering images were obtained under a ﬁxed delay between the excitation and probe laser pulses . With an increase in the maximal PNB diameter and lifetime , the moment of illumination moved further from the moment when the PNB reaches its maximal diameter . This explains the observed nonlinear effect of the pixel image amplitude . Another technical limitation of the imaging method is the dynamic range of the image sensor . If it is less than 60 dB , a wide range of PNB diameters would cause either satura - tion of the images of large bubbles or low sensitivity in the detec - tion of small bubbles . We analyzed three detection techniques ( protocols ) for imag - ing and measuring transient vapor nanobubbles generated as single events at nanoscale around laser pulse - heated metal nanoparticles . In optically transparent media , the location of nanobubbles can be best determined with time - resolved optical scattering imaging by using a delayed short optical pulse with regular CCD or CMOS cameras . The best quantitative analysis of vapor nanobubbles in the Plasmonic Nanobubbles 187 widest range of excitation energies and bubble diameters can be achieved by measuring the duration ( lifetime ) of the optical scatter - ing time - response by using a low - power continuous laser and matching photodetector . In the case of opaque media , the ampli - tude of the acoustical time - response provides good sensitivity and linearity in a range of excitation conditions that are limited by the onset of stress waves that additionally increase the amplitude of the nanobubble signal . The simultaneous use of two or three of these methods ( protocols ) provides the best results in the identiﬁcation , imaging , and measuring of transient nanobubbles in a single event experiment . 3 . 3 Example of the Protocol : Generation of PNBs in EGFR - Positive Cancer Cells in Vitro 3 . 3 . 1 Materials 1 .

Lapotko Part III Nanotechnology to Study Cancer Chapter 12 Force Measurements for Cancer Cells Vivek Rajasekharan , Varun K . A . Sreenivasan , and Brenda Farrell Abstract During cytoskeleton remodeling , cancer cells generate force at the plasma membrane that originates from chemical motors ( e . g . , actin ) . This force ( pN ) and its time course reﬂect the on and off - rates of the motors . We describe the design and calibration of a force - measuring device ( i . e . , optical tweezers ) that is used to monitor this force and its time course at the edge of a cell , with particular emphasis on the temporal resolution of the instrument .

Transi - tion to a mobile phenotype is triggered by gene mutations and growth factors ( e . g . , epidermal growth factor ) that initiate cyto - skeleton remodeling to form migratory structures ( e . g . , ﬁlopodia , invadopodia , and lamellapodia ) . These migratory structures enable cancer cells to breach the basement membrane and invade sur - rounding stroma both physically by generating force and chemi - cally by secreting enzymes [ 2 ] ; the presence of migratory structures is correlated with their metastatic potential [ 3 , 4 ] . Cell mobility is commonly measured in vitro with the Boyden chamber assay [ 5 ] which counts the number of cells that move from one chamber to another through a porous membrane , and the scratch assay [ 6 ] which monitors the time it takes for cells to repopulate a dimple or scratch on a surface plate . These methods monitor the migration of hundreds of cells over long time frames ( hours to days ) and provide the average migration rate ( e . g . , μ m 2 / h , for scratch assay , number of cells / day for Boyden assay ) of a population of cancer cells ; they do not reveal the biophysical or molecular mechanisms of mobility . More modern methods that Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 12 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 195 monitor the biophysical forces generated by cells reveal the characteristics of the motion . One example is traction force micros - copy [ 7 ] which monitors the imprint on a matrix created by con - tractile stresses of the cell as it propels itself within the substrate , where this substrate is sometimes replaced by a bed of needles ( spring constant (cid:1) 32 nN / μ m ) that bend ( > 0 . 2 μ m ) in response to this force [ 8 ] . This adhesive traction force is (cid:1) 10 – 300 nN when integrated over the area of a cell [ 8 , 9 ] . Studies show that the magnitude of the contractile force correlates with the metastatic potential of cancer cells [ 9 , 10 ] . This method has been scaled - up to monitor the average contractile force produced by a population of cells ( 10 – 40 cells per micropatterned plate ) [ 11 ] . At the leading dynamic edges of a cell ( e . g . , ﬁlopodia , lamelli - podia ) , pushing ( protrusive ) and pulling ( retractive ) forces are produced as the cytoskeleton undergoes remodeling . These forces are generated at an edge ( as opposed to over the entire surface ) and are in the pN range [ 12 – 17 ] . They result from work done on the membrane by chemical motors ( e . g . , actin , myosin , and tubulin ) acting at or near the plasma membrane and are detectable with optical tweezers [ 12 – 17 ] and atomic force microscopy [ 18 ] . We describe two approaches that make use of optical tweezers [ 14 – 17 , 19 – 21 ] . For the ﬁrst , a dielectric bead is trapped by a focused laser beam and is only used to monitor force . In this case , the bead binds to the membrane at the edge of a cell ( e . g . , tip of a ﬁlopodia ) and the position of the bead is monitored as the structure ( e . g . , ﬁlopodia ) undergoes cytoskeleton remodeling [ 14 , 15 , 17 ] . For the second approach , a trapped bead is used both as a sensor to monitor force , and as a handle to exert force ( Fig . 1a ) to form a new ﬁlopodium - like structure [ 16 , 19 – 21 ] sometimes coined a tether from a living cell . In this case , a trapped bead adheres to the cell membrane ( Fig . 1b ) . To separate the plasma membrane from the cytoskeleton , the body of the cell is moved away from the bead ( or the bead is moved away from the cell body ) at a constant loading rate ( pN / s ) ( Fig . 1c ) . A membrane tube forms once the membrane separates from the cytoskeleton . The extension of this tube to a ﬁxed length happens by continued application of the load , then the tube relaxes towards a stationary force when this load is removed ( Fig . 1d ) . When the tube is in this relaxed state we discern the magnitude of the stationary force , and detect the work done by chemical motors on the membrane ( Fig . 1e ) . During this process ( Fig . 1b – d ) , F - actin [ 20 , 21 ] and sometimes β - tubulin [ 21 ] poly - merize and ﬁll the lumen of the tube . This method is adapted from techniques designed to form membrane tubes from vesicles and from cells including red blood cells [ 22 ] , neurons [ 23 ] , neutrophils [ 24 ] and outer hair cells [ 25 ] . It was initially used to estimate the nonlocal bending modulus for the membranes of vesicles [ 26 ] or the plasma membrane of red blood cells [ 22 ] and later used to 196 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . Fig . 1 Force measured during and after tube formation . ( a ) Initial positon of the two bodies : a cell ﬁrmly attached to a Petri dish and a trapped ﬂuorescent bead . ( b ) The forces on the bead ( F ( x ) and F ( y ) ) are recorded with the two bodies kept stationary and about 20 μ m apart ( time , t : 0 – 10 s ) . The cell is then brought towards the bead in the X direction ( see Fig . 2 ) with the 3 - D piezo stage at 0 . 5 μ m / s ( t : 10 – 50 s ) . At t ~ 49 s the bodies touch and the cell is pushed towards the bead and a negative force F ( x ) is detected . The 3 - D piezo stage is stopped ( t : 50 – 60 s ) to allow the bodies to adhere . Inset shows a deformed cell . ( c ) The cell is then pulled away from the bead in the X direction with the 3 - D piezo stage at the same speed ( t : 60 – 80 s ) and a large positive force F ( x ) is detected as the membrane separates from cytoskeleton . Inset shows separation and initiation of tube formation . ( d ) Once the pulling stops the tube relaxes and F ( x ) decays to a stationary value . Inset shows the formed tube . ( e ) Sawtooths are observed to ride upon the stationary value . The inset shows ﬁlaments attached to membrane by linkers ( red ) . Upon depolymerization the linkers attach to penultimate position on the ﬁlament and the monomers are lost to the cytoplasm . This results in a positive force F ( x ) that adds to the stationary value . Experiment was conducted in PBS at 24 (cid:3) C with a HN - 31 cancer cell . The sampling frequency of both F ( x ) ( dark gray ) and F ( y ) ( light gray ) is 500 Hz except for ( c ) where it is 2 kHz Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 197 measure membrane - cytoskeleton adhesion [ 23 ] and the unbinding rates of the membrane from the cytoskeleton [ 27 , 28 ] . In most of these studies the force was measured at slow rates ( < 100 Hz ) or the tube was only stable for short times [ 27 , 28 ] . By measuring the force at a faster sampling rate ( 1 kHz ) at the edge of a stable structure we were able to detect nonstationary events ( e . g . , sawtooths ) that ride upon a stationary value [ 16 ] . We reason that these nonstationary events arose from depolymerization and poly - merization of F - actin that occurred at the tip of the structure , and estimated the on and off rates of this chemical motor within the cell . This provided the possibility that the kinetics of actin or other motor proteins within a cell are tractable by measuring the force and its time course at the membrane . Similar transients were measured when a trapped bead was placed at tips of ﬁlopodia of HeLa cells [ 17 ] , and of membrane tubes formed from cultured neurons [ 19 ] . However , in these reports there was no description of the time course of the transients . One of these studies suggests that the transients are the result of actin ﬁlaments pulled rearward towards the cell cortex by myosin motors [ 19 ] . The other report does not provide an explanation for the transients , but suggests that retrograde ﬂow of actin monomers drives retraction of ﬁlopodia and this pulling force requires membrane - actin linkages at the tip [ 17 ] . Our model also requires linkages between the ﬁlaments and the membrane at the tip , which act as transducers and convert the chemical energy to mechanical energy to drive membrane move - ment [ 16 ] . We suggest that the rise of the force during the saw - tooth originates from depolymerization of actin at the barbed end ( i . e . , tip ) by a type of stepping - end mechanism [ 29 ] . The linkers detach from the tip and re - attach at the penultimate position after which the monomers escape . This causes a pulling force , which adds to the stationary positive membrane force . Here , we show that we observe similar sawtooths at the edge of a cancer cell ( Fig . 1e ) . In our previous report , the temporal response of the instrument was not measured [ 16 ] . In this work , we ensure that the time constant of our newer instrument is readily measurable , as one goal is to determine the kinetics of chemical motors like actin at the edge of a cancer cell from such transients ( Fig . 1e ) and the kinetics of the intrinsic membrane - cytoskeleton bonds ( Fig . 1c ) . We do this by adding acousto - optic deﬂectors ( AODs ) to the optical path [ 25 ] , as they enable rapid movement of the trapped ﬂuorescent bead whose position is then tracked by monitoring an image of the bead with a fast quadrant photodiode . The instrument is based upon the design of Qian et al . [ 25 ] and the optical path is shown in Fig . 2 . 1 . 2 Description of Instrument A titanium ( Ti ) - sapphire laser serves as the trap ( Fig . 2 ) . It is pumped by a solid - state frequency - doubled neodymium - doped yttrium orthovanadate ( Nd : YVO4 ) laser . A half - wave plate ( not 198 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . shown ) rotates the plane of polarization of the trapping laser beam from vertical to horizontal . To set the wavelength of the trapping laser to 830 nm the beam is split , and the reﬂected beam is sent to a spectrometer . The transmitted beam is steered to ﬁll the back aperture of an objective lens of high numerical aperture ( NA ) that is part of an inverted microscope . Two acousto - optic deﬂectors ( AODs ) that are orthogonal ( AODX and AODY ) to each other control the laser power and position of the beam . Each AOD has two voltage inputs ( V a and V f ) : V f modiﬁes the acoustic frequency to control beam position and V a changes acoustic amplitude to control beam intensity . The laser beam is steered in the XY plane by changing the input fre - quency to the AODs . Two conﬁgurations were set - up depending upon the light source used to excite the bead ( see Note 1 ) . In the ﬁrst conﬁguration where a xenon lamp is used to excite the bead , the trapping laser beam is reﬂected by a dichroic , D2 , that reﬂects at wavelengths > 723 nm ( Fig . 2 , right inset ) . In the second Fig . 2 Schematic diagram of the optical tweezers ( not to scale ) . A laser beam ( λ : 830 nm ) that is focused by a high NA objective traps a ﬂuorescent bead beyond its focal zone . The ﬂuorescent bead is illuminated by a xenon ( right inset ) or TLED þ lamp where the change in position and intensity of the bead is measured with a quadrant photodiode ( QPD ) ( left inset ) . The sample is moved in the transverse and focal directions with a 3 - D piezo stage . A trapped bead is moved with the acousto - optic deﬂectors ( AODs ) and the ﬂuorescence image of the bead is continuously projected onto the QPD . The trapping plane is at a constant height , h in the focal direction ( Z ) above the surface of a Petri dish shown in a cartesian ( X , Y ) plane . Center inset shows an image ( projected by the camera onto the monitor ) of a trapped bead in the center surrounded by fringes that reﬂect the distance from the trapping plane to the surface of the Petri dish Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 199 conﬁguration where a transmitted light emitting diode ( TLED þ ) lamp is used , the beam of the trapping laser is reﬂected by dichroic , D1 , that reﬂects at a wavelength > 750 nm ( Fig . 2 ) . A fast quad - rant photodiode ( QPD ) detects the bead ﬂuorescence that is excited with either light source . It is mounted on a crossed - roller - bearing stage to facilitate focusing the ﬂuorescent image of the bead . In the ﬁrst conﬁguration , white light from the xenon lamp is directed through an excitation ﬁlter ( 530 < T < 590 nm ( T : transmission ) ; the excitation peak of ﬂuorescent bead is at 576 nm ) and reﬂected by a dichroic beam combiner and then by dichroic D2 towards the sample ( Fig . 2 , right inset ) . In the second conﬁguration , the white light from the TLED þ passes through the same excitation ﬁlter and is then reﬂected by dichroic D2 and transmitted through dichroic D1 towards the sample . The emitted light is transmitted through both dichroics ( TLED þ ) or through one dichroic ( xenon ) , this transmitted light is focused by lenses and then ﬁltered by an emission ﬁlter ( (cid:1) 600 < T < 700 nm ; the emis - sion peak is at 605 nm ) before being directed onto the QPD . A computer monitor mounted on the wall projects the image acquired by a monochrome CMOS ( complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ) camera and tracks the position of the beam or bead during set - up . A Petri dish that ﬁts within an insert of a 3 - D piezo stage is used to culture the cancer cells . This 3 - D piezo stage facilitates move - ment of the sample along X , Y and Z directions and is mounted within the mechanical stage on the inverted microscope . To operate the instrument we use hardware controlled by algorithms written in LabVIEW . The instrument is placed on an isolation table with feedback control that removes low frequency vibrations ( starting below 1 Hz ) in real time . Optical components are anchored ﬁrmly to the table and to each other to minimize the effects of any remaining acoustic sounds . The instrument is set - up in a dark room painted ﬂat black and acoustically isolated from the control equipment found in the adjacent support rooms by insula - tion in the walls . The support equipment in the adjacent room includes two chillers ( see Note 2 ) and the controls for Table , AODs , 3 - D piezo stage , xenon or TLED þ lamps . This is safer as after optical alignment and set - up the experimentalist monitors and controls the modules with the computer in the adjacent well - lit room , and not in the dark room , which houses the lasers and other parts of the instrument . 1 . 3 Theoretical Framework to Measure the Temporal Response of the Trap For displacements less than the radius of the bead ( R ) an optical trap acts like a Hookean spring [ 30 ] , where the force , ~ F ð r , θ Þ acting on the bead suspended above the surface of a dish at constant height ( h ) within the plane 0 (cid:4) r (cid:4) R , 0 (cid:4) θ (cid:4) 2 π is 200 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . ~ F ð r , θ Þ ¼ k P ½ ^ i ð r Cos θ Þ þ ^ j ð r Sin θ Þ(cid:5) ~ F ð x , y Þ ¼ k P ½ ^ i x þ ^ j y (cid:5) ð 1 Þ where r and θ describe the magnitude and direction of the force , k P is the lateral stiffness at a power ( P ) , ( where the subscript indicates the power is held constant ) , within the plane and ıˆ and jˆ are unit vectors along the X and Y directions . Equation 1 states k P is constant in the trapping plane , and there is no force acting on the bead when it is at the center ( r ¼ 0 , 0 (cid:4) θ (cid:4) 2 π ) . It also states there is only a component in the X direction if 0 < r (cid:4) R , θ ∈ 0 , π f g and only a component in the Y direction if 0 < r (cid:4) R , θ ∈ π 2 ; 3 π 2 (cid:1) (cid:3) . Speciﬁcally F x ð Þ ¼ k P x ð 2a Þ F y ð Þ ¼ k P y ð 2b Þ where (cid:6) R (cid:4) x (cid:4) R and (cid:6) R (cid:4) y (cid:4) R : In the case when there is no force the measured resultant ( r m ) reﬂects the noise of the recordings where the probability distribu - tion function is described by the Rayleigh distribution [ 31 ] P r m ð Þ ¼ r m σ 2 e (cid:6) r 2 m 2 σ 2 ð 3 Þ where σ is the scale factor of the distribution with mean r m and variance σ m 2 r m ¼ σ ﬃﬃﬃ π 2 r and σ 2 m ¼ σ 2 2 (cid:6) π 2 (cid:5) (cid:6) : ð 4 Þ When a trapped dielectric bead is displaced from its lateral equilib - rium position it experiences a restoring force proportional to the displacement , described in the X direction with β dx dt ¼ (cid:6) k P x ð 5 Þ where β is the Stokes damping constant ( Nsm (cid:6) 1 ) and t is the time . Note the inertial term [ 32 ] is not included , as it is negligible compared to the viscous term [ 33 , p . 299 ] . Rearranging and inte - grating from the displaced position of the bead x (cid:7) x 0 at t ¼ 0 back to the equilibrium position x t at t > 0 Eq . 5 becomes ð x t x 0 1 x dx ¼ (cid:6) k P β ð t 0 dt Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 201 x t ¼ x 0 e (cid:6) k P = β ð Þ t ¼ x 0 e (cid:6) τ P ð Þ t ð 6 Þ where the reciprocal time constant ( τ P ) for the bead trajectory is τ P ¼ k P β : ð 7 Þ β is calculated with the Stoke’s - Faxen law [ 34 ] β ¼ 6 πη R 1 (cid:6) 916 Rh (cid:7) (cid:8) þ 18 Rh (cid:7) (cid:8) 3 þ 45256 Rh (cid:7) (cid:8) 4 (cid:6) 116 Rh (cid:7) (cid:8) 5 h i ð 8 Þ where the term in the denominator considers the additional effect on the hydrodynamic drag caused by proximity of the Petri dish to the bead and η is the viscosity of the solution . We cannot readily measure P at the trapping plane ; instead it is measured at the objective lens in the absence of a Petri dish i . e . , P objective . We assume that this power measured is directly propor - tional to power at the trapping plane and provide evidence that this is the case . To calibrate the instrument we experimentally determine the : 1 . Radius , R of the bead ; 2 . Viscosity , η of the solution at the temperature , T of the experiments ; 3 . Lateral displacement of the bead , x , y relative to the center of the plane ; 4 . Height , h of the trapped bead above the Petri dish ; 5 . Reciprocal time constant , τ P of the trap at power P , and 6 . Show that the τ P and k P are linear functions of P measured at the objective . We then use Eq . 8 to calculate β , Eq . 7 to calculate k P as a function of P objective and Eqs . 1 and 2 to determine the force , ~ F ð r , θ Þ , F ( x ) and F ( y ) for constant P objective . We ﬁrst describe the reagents and equipment in Subheading 2 . This is followed by a description of procedures that are either required to be executed each time an experiment is performed or only once ( Subheadings 3 . 2 and 3 . 4 , step 7 of Subheading 3 . 5 , step 3 of Subheading 3 . 6 and Subheadings 3 . 7 and 3 . 9 ) . Brieﬂy , we describe how to determine the drop in power upon movement of the beam with the AODs . We show it is insigniﬁcant within the linear range of the trap , avoiding the need for an extra feedback loop . Then we describe a method to determine whether the trap moves with the same linear slope in both directions ( X , Y ) in response to the AODs . We show this to be the case , which elim - inates the requirement for calibration in both directions before each experiment . After which we describe the drag force method that we 202 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . use to measure τ P , and show it is linear with power . We then describe procedures to check reproducibility of the measurements , and to determine the typical noise within the signal . In the notes section , we suggest improvements . We conclude that the time constant of the instrument is sufﬁciently fast to enable monitoring the kinetics of chemical motors at the edge of a cancer cell . 2 Materials 2 . 1 Reagents 1 .

Place the portable keyboard ( above ) and the wall - mounted monitor within the dark room to facili - tate manipulations required during set up and calibration . 24 . Virtual instrument written with LabVIEW ( from v . 12 , National Instruments , Austin , TX ) that controls a programma - ble gate array ( FPGA ; PCIe 7852R ; 16 - bit resolution ; 40 MHz base clock ; National Instruments , Austin , TX ) and a data acquisition card ( DAQ PCIe - 6363 ; 16 - bit resolution ; National Instruments , Austin , TX ) set at its lowest gain of (cid:9) 0 . 1 V . The FPGA enables synchronous ( 25 ns clock of the FPGA board ) and continuous control of the two AODs and the 3 - D piezo stage . Voltages from the FPGA to AODs control the position ( (cid:9) 10 V ) and intensity ( (cid:9) 1 V ) of the laser beam . Analog voltages ( (cid:9) 10 V ) generated from the FPGA are also used to position the 3 - D piezo stage . The resolution of the analog inputs of the FPGA card is 0 . 3 mV , which is of the order of the signal measured by the QPD ( 1 – 16 mV ) and hence this FPGA is not suitable for collection of the sensor data . Instead , the voltage outputs from the QPD are monitored by the DAQ . A TTL pulse - train ( 200 kHz ) generated with the FPGA syn - chronizes the data acquired with the DAQ , and the control signals produced by the FPGA . 25 . MATLAB and toolboxes ( from version R2011b , The Math - works , Natick , MA ) used for analysis . 3 Methods 3 . 1 Measuring P Along the Optical Path ( See Note 4 ) The power is measured with the hand - held optical power meter with AODX and AODY held at their center frequency ( see Fig . 2 ) . 1 . Turn on pump laser that powers the trapping laser and let it warm up for 30 min . 2 . Use the spectrometer to ensure the trapping laser is set to 830 nm . If the wavelength of the laser beam is not 830 nm , adjust the knob on the trapping laser while measuring the wavelength with the spectrometer . 3 . Measure the power after the trapping laser ( Fig . 2 ) . Maximize the laser power with knobs located on the outside of the trapping laser box ; this optimizes the alignment of mirrors within the housing . We operate the pump laser at 5 W , below the maximum of 6 W to prolong the life of the pump . The output power after the trapping laser is typically 1 . 4 W . 4 . Measure the power after the half wave plate ( not shown ) posi - tioned after the beam splitter ( Fig . 2 ) . Maximize the power at this position by aligning the mirrors up to the half wave plate . The power is typically 1 . 2 W after the half wave plate . Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 205 5 . Measure the power after the AODs ( Fig . 2 ) . Maximize the power at this position by aligning the mirrors up to the AODs . The power drops to 0 . 55 Wafter the AODs , when the amplitude input to AODs is one half the maximum value at 0 . 5 V . 6 . Measure P objective : it should be maximal provided the beam is properly aligned . Reduce or increase the power at the pump to maintain P objective at a constant value for comparisons among ( the same ) experiments . This is 0 . 130 ( (cid:9) 0 . 001 ) W in our case . 7 . When there is a need to vary P objective , increase or decrease the power at the pump laser . 3 . 2 Measuring and Maintaining Constant P as the Beam is Moved with the AODs ( See Note 5 ) AODs are less efﬁcient as they move from their center frequency [ 35 , 36 ] . We now describe how to monitor P when the beam is moved by AODs . The laser beam is displaced by changing the voltage to the frequency inputs of the AODs . AODs control the intensity and position of the trapping laser beam at high rates ( > 100 kHz ) . Each AOD consists of a piezoelectric - based transducer across which a radio frequency voltage is applied . This generates a sound wave that is absorbed by the acousto - optic crystal . The sound wave pro - duces a periodic mechanical stress in the crystal , varying its atomic density . This causes a change in refractive index that follows the period of the sound wave and produces a moving - phase grating which diffracts the laser beam into several orders . The ﬁrst order is the most efﬁcient when the amplitude input V a is held at maximum value and the frequency input is held at f center . To steer the laser beam with an AOD , keep the amplitude input V a constant at one half of the maximum value 0 . 5 V ( 0 < V a (cid:4) 1 ) , and vary the frequency input by changing the voltage input V f to the voltage - to - frequency converter . The f center of the AOD , is 50 MHz ( V cf : 6 . 2 V ) ; as the frequency deviates from this center value diffraction efﬁciency decreases causing the power to drop . To determine this drop in power as a consequence of moving the beam with the AODs , we direct the beam on to a custom - built photode - tector and record the output voltage and compare it with that recorded when the beam is in the center position . This ratio pro - vides a measure of the drop in laser power . 1 . Direct the laser beam into the custom - built photodetector placed after the AODs . 2 . Vary the frequency input to AODX in steps ( e . g . , 0 . 395 MHz ) through its maximal steering range with AODY ﬁxed at one frequency . Record the output voltage from the photodetector at each step , and plot the voltage relative to voltage recorded at the center frequency as a function of the frequency of AODX ( Fig . 3 , left panel ) . 3 . Repeat steps 1 – 2 for the other 75 ﬁxed frequencies of AODY ( each increment 0 . 395 MHz ) . 206 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . A typical example of the drop in power is shown in Fig . 3 , left panel . We observe a 4 – 5 % decrease in power as AODX is moved (cid:9) 5 MHz from f center with AODY held at its center frequency . Each slice ( like the left panel ) is then concatenated to produce the 3 - D map of the power . The right panel shows a 3 - D view of the drop in laser power as the beam is moved through its maximal steering range of (cid:9) 15 MHz from f center . Each data point is recorded upon changing the frequency by 0 . 395 MHz and the map is compiled from 76 (cid:8) 76 measurements . Over this maximum steer - ing range of the AODs the drop is considerable at up to 30 % . Fortunately , the experiments described require an AOD frequency range of within 1 . 5 MHz of f center where the drop is less than 2 % . When signiﬁcant steering ranges are required the amplitude input could be changed to compensate for the drop in power due to change in acoustic frequency ( see Note 6 ) . For strategies to increase power refer to Notes ( see Note 7 ) . 3 . 3 Preparation to Trap a Bead ( See Note 4 ) 1 . Aliquot 2 μ l of the bead solution into 1 ml of water ( 18 . 0 M Ω cm ) . 2 . Centrifuge for 1 min at 10 , 000 (cid:8) g and resuspend in 1 ml of buffered saline ( see Note 8 ) . 3 . Place a Petri dish with 1 ml buffered saline into the insert of the 3 - D piezo stage of the inverted microscope . Fig . 3 The drop in laser power is small at (cid:4) 2 % within a 2 (cid:8) 2 μ m region of the trapping plane . Left panel : Drop in laser power with change in the acoustic frequency input to AODX with the input to AODY held constant at f center ( open circles ) . The dotted vertical lines represent the maximum range of the experiments . Right panel : A 3 - D map of the power . Frequency input to AODX is steered between (cid:9) 15 MHz of f center ( Δ V f ¼ (cid:9) 3 . 8 V ) with AODY ﬁxed at a frequency within the same range . Each data point was recorded upon changing the frequency by 0 . 395 MHz where the map was compiled from 76 (cid:8) 76 measurements . The f center of each AOD is 50 MHz and V a was set at 0 . 5 V for both AODs in all shown experiments Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 207 4 . Pipette 2 μ l of the resuspended bead - solution close to the coverslip edge of the Petri dish . 5 . Ensure the laser is on and steered to focus at the trapping plane , and the bright ﬁeld image of the beam projects onto the monitor by use of the CMOS camera ( see Subheading 3 . 1 ) . 6 . Focus on the bottom of the Petri dish and project the image onto the monitor with CMOS camera . 7 . Locate a bead that has not yet attached to the bottom by moving the dish laterally with the mechanical stage . 8 . The image of the laser beam projected by the camera appears as a spot at the center surrounded by concentric fringes . While projecting the image onto the monitor with the camera , focus on a bead by adjusting the ﬁne focus of the microscope , then move the bead into the center of the laser beam by use of the mechanical stage . The bead should enter the trap ( see Fig . 2 , center inset ) . 3 . 4 Determination of the Scale of the Trapping Plane ( See Note 5 ) We now establish whether the movement of the beam by each AOD is the same within the trapping plane and determine the V f required to move the beam 1 μ m . 1 . Steer the laser beam by changing V f in steps while tracking the displacement of the laser beam with the CMOS camera ( Fig . 4 ) . 2 . Analyze the images captured with scripts written with the Image Processing Toolbox of MATLAB to determine the num - ber of pixels the laser beam moves when V f is changed by one ( 1 ) V . In the example shown , AODY is orthogonal to AODX as expected ; however the beams move at an angle θ D ( (cid:6) 10 . 45 (cid:3) ) to the trapping plane ( Fig . 4 , top panel ) . This results in primary and secondary components where the magnitude of the sec - ondary component is about 20 % of the primary . We show that the beam moves linearly upon changing the voltage in AODX and AODY , and gets deﬂected by the same amount in X and Y for the same change in voltage ( Fig . 4 , center panel ) to exhibit slopes ( primary component ) of 75 . 86 pixels / V ( X ) and 75 . 48 pixels / V ( Y ) . We ﬁnd that the slope of the secondary component is about 1 / 5th of the primary component with the magnitude 3 % less along Y relative to X . We associate this small difference with an error in ﬁtting the data to this less steep slope . 3 . To translate this deﬂection of the beam from pixels to μ m , calibrate the CMOS camera with the slide micrometer by ﬁrst setting the frame size of each image captured by the camera to ensure that the pixels are square and not distorted . This is achieved by capturing a region of interest of 1280 ( X ) pixels 208 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . (cid:8) 1024 ( Y ) pixels for our camera . Then determine the number of pixels at each 10 μ m increment in both the X and Y direc - tions within each image . Plot the number of pixels as a function of distance and calculate the slope ( pixels / μ m ) . We make use of Image Processing Toolbox of MATLAB , and determine the slope in both directions to be 13 . 3 pixels / μ m . 4 . Alternatively , use a 3 - D piezo stage ( pre - calibrated with the slide micrometer ) to move a bead ﬁrmly attached to the bot - tom of a Petri dish and track the center of the bead with the same camera ( Fig . 4 , bottom panel ) . Analyze the images as described in step 2 and determine the conversion slopes . The slope for this relation is the same at 13 . 33 pixels / μ m ( X ) and 13 . 32 pixels / μ m ( Y ) . 5 . Determine the change in voltage V f required to move the beam 1 μ m by calculating the product of the two calibrations ( V / pixels (cid:8) pixels / μ m ) described in steps 2 and 3 or steps 2 and 4 . The change in voltage V f required to move the beam 1 μ m is the same for both AODs at 0 . 1757 V ( X ) and 0 . 1765 V ( Y ) within a 2 μ m (cid:8) 2 μ m region of the trapping plane . We con - clude that the beam can be steered with a resolution of (cid:9) 2 nm limited by the 16 - bit resolution of the analog outputs of FPGA at (cid:9) 0 . 3 mV . 3 . 5 Description and Analysis of the Signal from the QPD : Determine the Lateral Displacement ( x , y ) Relative to the Center of the Plane The position and intensity of the detected ﬂuorescent light is translated to an electrical signal by the QPD . The emitted light is directed towards the center of the QPD such that the difference in intensity between the left and right quadrants and top and bottom quadrants is zero ( Fig . 2 , left inset ) . As the bead moves from this center position , there is a shift in intensity among the four quad - rants . The X output is the difference in voltage between the left ( B , C ) and right ( A , D ) quadrants and the Y output is the difference in voltage between the top ( A , B ) and bottom ( C , D ) quadrants . The sum Σ is the total intensity in all four quadrants , and is used to normalize X and Y outputs to correct for intensity ﬂuctuations especially due to photobleaching of the bead . The measured cur - rent , I MQ in each quadrant Q Q ∈ A ; B ; C ; D f g ð Þ of the QPD is the sum of the current due to light emitted by the bead , I LQ and a dark current , I DQ present in the absence of the bead . This current is relayed through a ﬁrst - stage ampliﬁer of the QPD whose resistance ( R1 ) is 200 k Ω . Speciﬁcally the measured output in volts for each quadrant V MQ is V QM ¼ I QM R1 ¼ ð I QL þ I QD Þ R1 , Q ∈ f A , B , C , D g : ð 9 Þ The signal is differenced and ampliﬁed by a second stage ampliﬁer of the QPD with gain , G of 1 , 3 or 10 ( V / V ) and the measured signal from the X and Y outputs are Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 209 Fig . 4 The laser beam moves linearly with a change in V f to the AODs and the magnitude of the displacement is the same in both directions . Top panel : Orientation of the steered beam within the cartesian plane of the trap ( see Fig . 2 ) . The insets show images of the beam recorded at described voltages for AODX ( bottom ) and AODY ( top ) . The angle θ D is (cid:6) 10 . 45 (cid:3) relative to X ( AODX steering ) and Y ( AODY steering ) axes . Center panel : The primary component of the beam position detected with the CMOS camera upon changing the frequency to AODX ( open circles with blue border ) or AODY ( closed orange circles with no border ) , where the center frequency is considered to be the origin .

The signal due to the presence of the bead is found by writing Eq . 10 in terms of Δ X L , Δ Y L and P L . To account for intensity ﬂuctuations of the bead the signal is normalized by the sum ( V / V ) Δ X L P L ¼ Δ X M (cid:6) ð Δ X D G Þ P M (cid:6) P D (cid:7) (cid:8) G ; ð 11a Þ Δ Y L P L ¼ Δ Y M (cid:6) Δ Y D G ð Þ P M (cid:6) P D (cid:7) (cid:8) G : ð 11b Þ To convert this normalized voltage to nm a trapped bead is moved a known distance , Δ x with AODX ( by changing V f ) and the linear slope for X , m QPDX ( V / V / nm ) is determined with m QPDX ¼ Δ X L Σ L Δ x ð 12a Þ (cid:1) Fig . 4 ( continued ) are the robust linear least - squares ﬁt to the primary compo - nent ( r cos θ D ) with slopes 75 . 86 ( 0 . 62 ) pixels / V ( X ) and 75 . 48 ( 0 . 48 ) pixels / V ( Y ) ( standard deviation in parenthesis ) . The inset shows the secondary component ( rs in θ D ) with slopes 14 . 29 ( 0 . 63 ) pixels / V ( X ) and 13 . 09 ( 0 . 45 ) pixels / V ( Y ) . Bottom panel : The 3 - D piezo stage is used to move the Petri dish with ﬂuorescent beads attached to the surface of the dish . The insets show position of the bead in pixels where the center - to - center distance between beads is 10 μ m . Note the scale of the inset is not the same as shown on the abscissa . The solid lines are the robust linear least - squares ﬁt to the data and exhibit slopes of 13 . 325 ( 0 . 014 ) pixels / μ m ( X ) and 13 . 322 ( 0 . 030 ) pixels / μ m ( Y ) . The center ( i . e . , 100 μ m ) of the range of the 3 - D piezo stage is taken as the origin . Each symbol ( bottom and center panels ) is the mean of three replicates where the standard deviation lies within the marker Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 211 In the same manner m QPDY is m QPDY ¼ Δ Y L Σ L Δ y : ð 12b Þ where Δ y is the distance the trapped bead moves in nm in the Y direction when V f to AODY is changed ( data not shown ) ( see Note 9 ) . QPD scalar voltage signals ( three channels ) that monitor bead displacement and bead ﬂuorescence are recorded at a sampling frequency of 200 kHz ( each channel ) and saved in TDMS format , a technical data management solution that is optimized for storing time series data and a propriety format of National Instruments . This format is fast and compact . For example , a TDMS ﬁle ( 6 - digit precision i . e . , μ V ) of 42 MB size , when converted to a text ﬁle ( 6 - digit precision ) requires 102 MB of storage . A properties ﬁle that contains the experimental conditions and metadata associated with the measurement is saved with every TDMS data ﬁle . The metadata includes dark current offsets of the QPD , voltages , and their dura - tions at the frequency inputs of both AODs , voltages at the ampli - tude inputs of both AODs , and durations , positions , and velocities of the 3 - D piezo stage . To estimate the lateral displacement of a trapped bead , ﬁrst determine the normalized signals i . e . , left hand side of Eq . 11 which are described in steps 1 – 6 and then convert them to a spatial measure described in step 7 ( see Note 10 ) . 1 . Move the QPD by adjusting the crossed - roller - bearing stage to align the focal spot of the light with the plane of the QPD and maximize the value of P L . 2 . Record the dark current before each experiment by measuring Δ X D , Δ Y D and P D in the absence of a sample and in the dark . The typical voltage offset due to dark current exhibits a value of about 200 μ V in the sum ( range 80 – 600 μ V ) . 3 . Turn on the light source ( xenon or TLED þ lamp ) to excite the bead . 4 . Position the bead at the center of the QPD with Δ X L and Δ Y L at zero ( Fig . 2 , left inset ) . 5 . Measure Δ X M , Δ Y M , and Σ M and relay to the DAQ at a sam - pling frequency of 200 kHz / channel ( total bandwidth 600 kHz ) . 6 . When the measurement is complete determine Δ X L Σ L and Δ Y L Σ L with Eq . 11 . Typical values of Δ X L and Δ Y L are (cid:4) 16 mV ( G : 10 ) and Σ L (cid:1) 1 – 2 . 8 mV ( see Note 11 ) . 7 . Displace a trapped bead ( (cid:6) 5000 nm to 5000 nm , step size : 500 nm , period 80 ms ) by changing the input V f to AODX ( making use of the calibrations shown in legend of Fig . 4 and 212 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . Subheading 3 . 4 ) with input to AODY kept constant . Figure 5 shows a representative example of the spatial position of the bead in the X direction ( primary component ) as a function of the normalized QPD voltage signal arising from the bead . The relationship is linear up to the radius of the bead , R ( 2000 nm ) as expected by theory [ 30 ] . The slope of this relation ( Eq . 12 ) , m QPDX or m QPDY ( V / V / nm ) is used to convert the normalized QPD spatial voltage signal ( numerator ) into a distance measure i . e . , nm for each direction . 3 . 6 Determination of Reciprocal Time Constant τ of the Trap Upon Varying P ( See Note 12 ) We use a variation of the drag force method called the step response method [ 37 ] to measure the reciprocal time constant . 1 . Displace the trap rapidly with a square wave input ( (cid:9) 350 nm , period 80 ms ) to either AODX or AODY and measure the subsequent trajectory of the trapped bead with the QPD for one minute . Collect data at 200 kHz per channel and average 750 resulting waves . Figure 6 ( left panel ) shows a typical exam - ple of the bead trajectory during a step down . The bead trajec - tory is delayed relative to the step , due to the drag force exerted on the bead by the surrounding ﬂuid ( see Note 13 ) . 2 . Determine the reciprocal time constant of this exponential decay by ﬁtting the data to Eq . 5 where the amplitude of the Fig . 5 Normalized voltage signal from the QPD varies linearly with displacement up to radius of the bead . An optically trapped ﬂuorescent bead is displaced up to (cid:9) 5 μ m by altering the input voltage of AODX while keeping the input to AODY at the center frequency and monitoring the intensity and position of the bead with the QPD . The symbols represent the primary component of the movement in the X direction after normalization ( see Eq . 11a ) . The solid line is the best ﬁt of data to the linear region ( (cid:9) 2 μ m ) and exhibits a slope of 0 . 91 ( V / V ) / μ m ( see Eq . 12a ) . The experiments were conducted with a QPD - gain G of 3 V / V , resistance R1 of 200 k Ω ( see Eqs . 9 and 10a ) , and a power of 130 mW at the objective Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 213 square wave ( x o ) is ﬁxed at the size of the step , 350 nm and the subscript P of τ P represents P objective . For this example , we ﬁnd τ P (cid:7) P objective to be 920 s (cid:6) 1 when P objective is 40 mW . 3 . To show the reciprocal time constant increases linearly with P objective , repeat steps 1 and 2 for different P objective ( see Subheading 3 . 1 ) . We show that τ P (cid:7) P objective ¼ τ P objective (cid:7) (cid:8) ¼ mP objective ð 13 Þ and determine a slope , m of 22 . 66 s (cid:6) 1 mW (cid:6) 1 . To determine k at each P objective we need to know β which depends upon R , η and h . 3 . 7 Determine the Radius , R of the Bead ( See Note 5 ) The R speciﬁed by the manufacturer is 2 μ m and we describe a method to verify it . 1 . Execute steps 1 – 4 of Subheading 3 . 3 except ensure the beads adhere ﬁrmly to the coverslip . 2 . Focus at the bottom ( inside surface ) of the dish while projecting the image of the beads onto the monitor by use of the CMOS camera . Fig . 6 The reciprocal time constant of the optical trap increases linearly with laser power . Left panel : The black open diamonds represent the trajectory of a trapped bead upon setting the bead in periodic motion ( (cid:9) 350 nm , period 80 ms ) by use of AODX ( solid blue line , AODY constant ) . The solid gray line is the best ﬁt of the decay to an exponential and the inset shows the ﬁt on a log scale . The reciprocal time constant τ P (cid:7) P objective is calculated by ﬁtting the data to Eq . 6 and is 920 s (cid:6) 1 at P objective of 40 mW . Right panel : τ p varies linearly with power , where each open blue diamond represents the mean and standard deviation of four ( 4 ) to ten ( 10 ) measure - ments . The solid line is least squares ﬁt of data to a linear function with slopes 22 . 66 s (cid:6) 1 mW (cid:6) 1 ( left ordinate , blue ) and 0 . 000878 pNnm (cid:6) 1 mW (cid:6) 1 ( right ordinate , green ) . The ﬁlled diamonds ( orange ) are measurements in Y direction upon stimulation with AODY ( AODX is kept constant ) . The inset shows the motion of the bead with powers 120 ( fastest , red ) , 80 ( green ) , and 40 ( slowest , black ) mW at the objective . Data was collected at 200 kHz for (cid:1) one ( 1 ) minute and 750 waves were averaged to retain a time resolution of 5 μ s per point 214 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . 3 . Measure the diameter of the beads ( 2 R ) in pixels and use the linear slope determined in step 3 or 4 of Subheading 3 . 4 to convert the pixels into μ m . We verify R to be 2 . 13 (cid:9) 0 . 019 μ m . 3 . 8 Determine the Viscosity , η of the Solution at the Temperature , T of Experiments ( See Note 4 ) The viscosity ( η ) depends upon the temperature ( T ) and the chemi - cal composition of the saline . The main chemical component of our saline solutions is NaCl ( 150 mM ) . To determine T we place the thermocouple into the solution within the Petri dish . The average temperature of the solution is typically 24 (cid:3) C , and we calculate η to be 0 . 920 mNsm (cid:6) 2 . It is calculated with an empirical expression ( i . e . , Eq . 11 ) found in Ozbek and others [ 38 ] which was formulated from a wide range of viscosity measurements ( see Note 14 ) . 3 . 9 Determination of the Height of the Trapped Bead h , from the Surface ( See Note 15 ) The size of the outermost fringe ( Fig . 2 , center inset ) around the trapped bead ( or laser spot ) reﬂects the distance between the trapped bead and the Petri dish . This is used as a visual marker to ensure h is constant among measurements ; h decreases as we move the Petri dish close to the bead and increases in the opposite direction . To measure the magnitude of h ( h ¼ d + R , where d is shortest distance between bead and Petri dish ) we estimate the time the Petri dish takes to make impact with the bead when the dish is moved at a constant velocity towards the bead . 1 . Trap a bead above the surface of the Petri dish ( refer to Subheading 3 . 3 ) . 2 . Move the Petri dish with 3 - D piezo stage to height , h by monitoring the size of the outermost fringe . 3 . Set the trapped bead in motion with a square wave input to either AOD ( refer to Subheading 3 . 6 ) . 4 . Move the Petri dish towards the bead at a speed , v Z of 0 . 1 μ ms (cid:6) 1 with the 3 - D piezo stage . 5 . Determine the height of the bead from the time at the point of impact . Figure 7 demonstrates this measurement . The dish makes impact after time , t Z of 74 s . Therefore , d ¼ 74 ( t Z Þ (cid:8) 0 . 1 v Z ð Þ ¼ 7 : 4 μ m and h ¼ 7 . 4 þ 2 . 1 ¼ 9 . 5 μ m . The mean h determined for six independent measurements is 9 . 88 (cid:9) 0 . 04 μ m . 6 . Calculate β with Eq . 8 . In this example , we calculate β to be 3 . 91 (cid:8) 10 (cid:6) 5 pNsnm (cid:6) 1 ( see Note 16 ) . 7 . Calculate k P (cid:7) P objective with Eq . 7 ( see Note 17 ) . 8 . Determine the slope m β from the linear plot of k P as a function of P objective k P (cid:7) P objective ¼ k ð P objective Þ ¼ m β P objective : ð 14 Þ In this case m β is 0 . 000878 pNnm (cid:6) 1 mW (cid:6) 1 ( Fig . 6 , right panel ) . Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 215 Our data show that τ P and k P are linear with P objective with slopes m and m β that are reﬂective of our instrument . This linear relationship allows us to compare our measured τ P and k P with values determined with other instruments provided they also exhibit a linear function with power . We make these comparisons by adjusting β for R where h is taken to be (cid:1) 10 μ m because R is often reported , but h is not . There is one report where the reciprocal time constant was measured by rapidly perturbing the trapped bead with AODs [ 37 ] ; Simmons and colleagues showed τ P and k P were linear with power . The measured τ P for a k P of 0 . 11 pNnm (cid:6) 1 is (cid:1) 12 , 000 s (cid:6) 1 for a bead with R of 0 . 5 μ m . For a R of 2 μ m used in our experiments the reciprocal time constant would be four times lower at 3000 s (cid:6) 1 , which is comparable to our measured value of 2840 s (cid:6) 1 ( Fig . 6 , right panel ) and corroborates the measurements . Other reports perform power spectrum analysis [ 34 , 39 – 41 ] to determine the angular corner frequency , f c . We compare our data with these measurements as f c relates to τ P by f c ¼ τ P 2 π : ð 15 Þ We calculate τ P from the measured f c and scale to adjust for varia - tion in bead size . We determine τ P to be 450 , 584 , 1601 , and 1908 s (cid:6) 1 for a range of k P at 0 . 0183 [ 39 ] , 0 . 021 [ 40 ] , 0 . 06 [ 41 ] Fig . 7 Measuring the height , h of the bead above the surface of the Petri dish . The left plot shows the trajectory of a trapped bead upon setting the bead in periodic motion ( (cid:9) 650 nm , period 80 ms ) by use of AODX ( solid ( blue ) line ) with AODY constant . This motion is arrested when the surface of the Petri dish impacts the bead . This is carried out by moving the dish in the focal ( Z ) direction towards the bead with the 3 - D piezo stage at a rate of 0 . 1 μ ms (cid:6) 1 ( indicated by the arrow ) . The bottom right inset shows the geometry of the experiment 216 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . and 0 . 08 [ 34 ] pNnm (cid:6) 1 which are comparable to our measured values of τ P at 472 , 542 , 1548 , and 2065 s (cid:6) 1 for the same k P ( Fig . 6 , right panel ) . This corroboration of measurements from different laboratories and instruments suggests that it is reasonable to assume that P objective is proportional to the power at the trapping plane ( see Subheading 1 . 3 ) . This data show that events occurring at rates slower than the corner frequency of 469 s - 1 ( calculated with Eq . 13 for τ P (cid:7) 0 : 130 W : 2946 s (cid:6) 1 ) can be detected with high ﬁdelity . This corner frequency is of the order of the rate for actin polymerization in cells [ 42 ] , tubulin polymerization [ 43 ] , and the fast kinetic steps of kinesins [ 44 ] and unconventional myosins [ 45 , 46 ] . It is faster than the reported rate ( (cid:1) 100 s (cid:6) 1 ) we observed for actin polymerization , and conﬁrms the measurements were not limited by the temporal response of the instrument [ 16 ] . 3 . 10 Reliability and Consistency of Measurements ( See Note 4 ) Before each experiment , calibrate the position sensor and deter - mine the stiffness and reciprocal time constant to compare consis - tency among experiments . In our case we conduct experiments at the same P objective of 0 . 130 W ( see Subheading 3 . 1 ) . 1 . Trap a bead above the surface of the Petri dish ( refer to Subheading 3 . 3 ) . 2 . Send square wave inputs of amplitudes (cid:9) 500 and (cid:9) 800 nm with a period of 80 ms to one of the AODs to displace the optical trap ( refer to Subheading 3 . 6 ) . Then record the devia - tion in the voltage signal of the trapped bead between the baseline and peak positions with the QPD as it follows the square wave generated by AOD . Figure 8 ( top panel ) shows a plot of this sensor response relative to the amplitude of the input square waves in nm . The bead displacement varies linearly with the resulting normalized voltage signal to exhibit a slope m QPDX of 0 . 00028 V / V / nm . The slopes measured on differ - ent days are consistent and exhibit a normal distribution with mean m QPDX of 0 . 00027 ( (cid:9) 0 . 00002 ) V / V / nm ( Fig . 8 , center panel ) . 3 . Check whether k P (cid:7) P objective is consistent among experiments by ﬁrst measuring τ P (cid:7) P objective , and then calculating k P (cid:7) P objective ( refer to Subheadings 3 . 6 – 3 . 9 ) . We determine τ P (cid:7) P objective as described in steps 1 and 2 of Subheading 3 . 6 , except in this case we move the beam with square waves of four different amplitudes ( see square waves described in step 2 above ) . The reciprocal time constant in response to each square wave input is measured , and the average value of the four measures is then used to calculate k P (cid:7) P objective . Figure 8 ( bottom panel ) shows the normal distribution of k P (cid:7) 0 : 130 W with a mean and standard deviation of 0 . 116 ( (cid:9) 0 . 011 pNnm (cid:6) 1 ) ( see Note 18 ) . Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 217 Fig . 8 Position sensor is calibrated and k P is measured before each experiment . A trapped bead is displaced by initiating periodic movement of the bead with AODX ( square waves : amplitudes of (cid:9) 500 nm and (cid:9) 800 nm and period 80 ms ) with AODY constant . The trajectory of the trapped bead is recorded with the QPD and is further analyzed . Top panel : The diamonds ( blue ) show the normalized voltage signal in V / V recorded for the displacements of the trapped bead between the baseline and peak positions .

Bottom panel : Histogram for 56 independent 218 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . 3 . 11 Quantifying the Displacement of a Trapped Bead in the Absence of a Force : Estimating the Signal to Noise Ratio , SNR The projection of the ﬂuorescent bead on the QPD can be described by the position vector ( r , θ ) . In the absence of a force the bead occupies each quadrant for an equivalent amount of time . This position vector ( r m , θ ) of the bead is transformed to the X and Y components by the electronics of the QPD and further trans - formed to displacements ( nm ) x and y with Eq . 12 . Each compo - nent , exhibits a probability distribution that is Gaussian . These signals do not reﬂect the true noise , it is described by the magni - tude of the scale factor determined upon ﬁtting r m to a Rayleigh distribution ( Eq . 3 ) . We also determine whether the detector exhi - bits bias by examining the distribution of θ . To do this we analyze 10 s of data ( Fig . 9 , top panel ) before each experiment ( Fig . 1 ) , which were collected at 200 kHz / channel , and further averaged to sampling rates between 2000 and 100 Hz with scripts written in MATLAB . 1 . Determine the displacement in nm i . e . x and y ( see Subhead - ing 3 . 5 ) from the ﬁrst 10 s of data . Figure 9 , top panel shows typical example at a sampling frequency of 2 kHz . 2 . Calculate r m ( with Eq . 3 ) and θ from x and y and ﬁt to Rayleigh and uniform probability distributions , respectively . We ﬁnd θ exhibits values between 0 (cid:3) and 360 (cid:3) with equal probability ( center panel , left ) to ﬁt a uniform distribution function with a mean of 0 . 0028 per degree ( center panel , right ) . r m exhibits a Rayleigh distribution with σ , r m , and σ m 2 of 18 . 6 nm , 23 . 3 nm and 145 nm 2 ( see Eqs . 3 and 4 ) . We calculate a mean value for σ to be 21 . 9 nm ( 15 (cid:4) σ (cid:4) 30 , at sampling frequency of 2 kHz ) for 11 recordings . At 2 kHz we can reliably resolve displace - ments of (cid:1) 45 nm ( signal to noise displacement ratio is 2 : 1 ) , while at 100 Hz the resolution is (cid:1) 12 nm . σ decreases with the logarithm of the sampling frequency to exhibit an intercept of 0 . 8 nm at zero sampling frequency ( Fig . 9 , lower right panel ) . This is of the order of the resolution of the DAQ card at 0 . 4 – 0 . 9 nm ( It is calculated with Eq . 11a and 12a with m QPDX of 0 . 00027 V / V / nm , P L of 1 – 2 . 8 mV , G of 10 , and Δ X M of 3 μ V , assuming no dark current ) . The xenon lamp was used as the excitation source for these measurements ( see Fig . 2 , right inset ) ( see Note 19 ) . 3 . 12 Summary of Methods A ﬂow chart summarizing the methodology is shown in Fig . 10 . Improvements are described in notes and include : ( 1 ) strategies to improve temporal resolution ( see Note 20 ) and spatial resolution (cid:1) Fig . 8 ( continued ) measurements of k P ( pN / nm ) . Solid line ( red ) is a ﬁt of the data to a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation 0 . 116 (cid:9) 0 . 011 pN / nm . The experiments were conducted with G at 10 V / V ( Eq . 10a ) and resistance of R1 at 200 k Ω ( Eq . 9 ) , and power at the objective of 130 mW Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 219 ( see Note 21 ) ; ( 2 ) how to monitor the real - time position of the 3 - D piezo stage ( response time ) ( see Note 22 ) and improved data management strategies ( see Note 23 ) . Fig . 9 In the absence of a force , r m exhibits a Rayleigh distribution and θ is described by a uniform distribution . Top panel : Measured displacement ( x : dark gray , y : light gray ) of a trapped bead before onset of an experiment . Sampling frequency is 2 kHz . Center panel left : A histogram of θ calculated from the data ( 2 seconds of data ) where the four concentric circles represent 50 , 100 , 150 , and 200 counts per division . Center panel right : θ is ﬁt to a uniform distribution ( dashed line ) with mean 0 . 0028 per degree . The width of each bin is 0 . 3125 (cid:3) where N T is total count at 4000 . Bottom panel left : r m is described with a Rayleigh distribution with σ of 18 . 6 nm , r m of 23 . 3 nm and σ m 2 of 145 nm 2 . Bottom panel right : σ scales with the log of the sampling frequency . Each data point represents the mean and standard deviation of 11 independent measure - ments calculated upon averaging the data sampled at 200 kHz , 100 - 2000 times , and determined upon ﬁtting to Rayleigh distribution . The dashed line is the ﬁt of the data to a power function with exponent of 0 . 435 nmHz - 0 . 435 and σ of 0 . 8 nm at zero sampling frequency 220 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . 4 Notes 1 . Initially a xenon lamp was used . As the xenon lamp ages , the attachment point of the arc on the cathode wobbles , causing ﬂuctuations in the brightness of the arc . This process is coined Fig . 10 Flow chart summarizing key steps of experimental methods . The shaded areas identify procedures that only require to be performed once Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 221 arc wander and results in extra frequency components within the signal . Given that the bulbs are expensive to replace we exchanged the xenon lamp for a TLED þ lamp . 2 . The chillers use distilled water purchased from retail stores , as recommended by Spectra Physics engineers . 3 . The QPD is powered by a nine ( 9 ) V battery ( cf . power supply ) to reduce electrical line noise . If it is possible , all electrical equipment should be battery - powered to reduce electrical noise . 4 . This procedure needs to be repeated before each set of experi - ments ( e . g . , once a day ) . 5 . This procedure needs to be performed only once . 6 . This can be achieved by reference to a look - up table . The data shown in Fig . 3 was recorded with V a set at its center value . To construct a look - up table many more measurements at differ - ent V a would be needed ( e . g . , incrementing by 0 . 005 V between 0 and 1 V is an additional 200 values ) . For each value of V a , vary the frequency inputs to AODX and AODY as described in steps 2 and 3 over the desired steering range and then determine the drop in laser power relative to the power measured at the center frequency . Plot the loss of power as a function of V a at each frequency ; in this case there are 76 plots each with 201 points for each AOD . Store the values in a look - up table . When the beam is moved a signiﬁcant amount by each AOD refer to the look - up table to discern by how much V a needs to be changed to keep the power constant as the beam is moved a signiﬁcant distance . This requires writing an algorithm to execute the feed - back loop to adjust V a based upon the reference data within the look - up table . 7 . When a feedback loop is not necessary to maintain a constant power during the experiments , V a can be increased to one ( 1 ) V at both AODs and the pump laser could be set to its maxi - mum value of 6 W to obtain maximum power at the objective . 8 . Rinsing the beads is necessary to remove additives and to facilitate their adhesion to surfaces . 9 . If the movement of the beam by both AODs is not the same , it would be necessary to determine m QPDX and m QPDY separately before each experiment . 10 . Steps 1 – 6 need to be repeated before each set of experiments ( e . g . , once a day ) . Step 7 needs to be performed to check the linearity for distances beyond R only once , after which only the slope is calculated for distances < R each time ( see step 2 of Subheading 3 . 10 ) . 11 . This is at least 300 times more than the nominal resolution of the DAQ at 3 μ V . In addition , we veriﬁed this resolution to be 222 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . of this order ( i . e . , 2 – 5 μ V ) by measuring the analog inputs at the DAQ terminals when they are not connected to the instru - ment . This magnitude is below the integrated bandwidth ( up to 100 kHz ) noise of the QPD calculated with 2 μ V rms / ( Hz ) 1 / 2 . 12 . Steps 1 and 2 need to be repeated before each set of experi - ments ( e . g . , once a day ) . Step 3 needs to be performed only once . 13 . The AODs are moved with an input square pulse from the FPGA of frequency 12 . 5 Hz ( period : 80 ms ) . Data acquisition starts when the DAQ card receives the ﬁrst pulse from the FPGA . 14 . A temperature control unit can be implemented to make mea - surements at physiological temperature i . e . , 37 (cid:3) C . 15 . Steps 1 – 6 and 8 are performed only once provided all experi - ments are conducted with the trapped bead at the same height . The stiffness needs to be calculated for each set of experiments from the value for the reciprocal time constant determined for that set . 16 . This β is larger than that calculated when the proximity of the Petri dish to the bead is not considered i . e . , 3 . 47 (cid:8) 10 (cid:6) 5 pNsnm (cid:6) 1 . 17 . There is a 13 % increase in the stiffness when h is considered , which demonstrates that this parameter needs to be kept con - stant and preferably measured when h ! 2 R . 18 . Deviation in k P (cid:7) 0 : 130 W could be due to : ( 1 ) errors in the measurement of P objective ; ( 2 ) deviations in h or R among experiments ; and ( 3 ) variation of power at the trapping plane due to differences in the optical properties of coverslips . 19 . The xenon lamp was later replaced with a TLED þ lamp . The ﬁrst prototype tested ( loaner from Sutter Instruments ) exhib - ited a bias in θ with σ 5 – 10 nm greater than that observed with the xenon lamp . The scale factor returned to (cid:1) 22 nm , and the detector became unbiased when this old controller for the TLED þ was replaced with a new one . 20 . A higher dynamic range ( f c > 500 s (cid:6) 1 ) could be achieved by increasing the reciprocal time - constant of the instrument through reduction of the bead radius ( Eqs . 7 and 8 ) . However , this improved temporal ﬁdelity will result in reduced spatial range and decreased bead brightness at the sensor . A second strategy to extend the dynamic range is to increase power at the objective . When the pump laser is set to 6 W we ﬁnd P objective is 0 . 243 W and τ P is 5500 s (cid:6) 1 , k P is 0 . 215 pNnm (cid:6) 1 and f c is greater at 875 s (cid:6) 1 . Other strategies to increase power include : increasing V a of AODs from 0 . 5 to 1 V , or by bypassing the Force Measurements for Cancer Cells 223 AODs in the laser path once calibration is complete . AODs result in a 50 % drop in laser power ; though they are used to measure the reciprocal time constant , they are unused during experimental manipulations with cells . However , an increase in the trapping power will increase the likelihood that cells will exhibit phototoxic effects , although this should be less pro - nounced at 830 nm which is the wavelength of our trapping laser [ 47 , 48 ] . 21 . The spatial resolution can be improved by reducing the sam - pling rate , but this comes at a loss of temporal precision . One strategy to improve spatial resolution is to increase the QPD output voltage i . e . , Σ . This can be achieved by enhancing the input signal intensity by use of brighter ﬂuorescent beads or by increasing the power of the excitation illumination ( i . e . , TLED þ or xenon lamps ) . There is a limit to this power as it will increase the photo - bleaching rate of beads , which will impact the duration of experiments . A better strategy is to use sensors that exhibit greater optical - sensitivity . For example , Single Photon Avalanche Diode ( SPAD ) devices are optical detectors that comprise an array of avalanche photodiodes [ 49 ] . They offer single photon sensitivities at visible wave - lengths and the capability of parallel read - outs from individual pixels at > 10 MHz . The bead can be monitored with improved sensitivity and time resolution when a SPAD array is used in conjunction with a sensitive FPGA as this will enable fast on - board signal processing and live tracking of a bead . This would enable active feedback control of the V f input to the AODs , and facilitate implementation of the instrument in force - clamp mode . In this case , the data card would require to exhibit higher resolution than we currently use . Finally , there have been major advancements in signal processing tech - niques that remove noise from measurements [ 50 , 51 ] while retaining the temporal ﬁdelity of the signal . They include denoising algorithms that utilize wavelets [ 50 ] and empirical mode decomposition which make use of the intrinsic functions of the signal [ 51 ] . We have tested these techniques , and started to incorporate them into the analysis and will report this in a later communication . 22 . The durations , positions , and velocities of movements of 3 - D piezo stage are currently saved as metadata in the TDMS properties ﬁle ( see Subheading 3 . 5 ) . This is normally sufﬁcient to match the QPD data with the stage position , as the stage control ( FPGA ) and QPD acquisition ( DAQ ) systems are syn - chronized to within 5 μ s with a TTL pulse - train ( 200 kHz ) . However , as the temporal response of the stage is in the order of ms ( mean : 10 ms ) , not μ s , it is sometimes necessary to monitor the real - time position of the 3 - D piezo stage . This 224 Vivek Rajasekharan et al . can be performed with the existing FPGA card . The DAQ card is not a satisfactory option , because round - robin scanning mode of the analog - to - digital converter exhibits signiﬁcant signal cross - talk , when the input voltages differ by more than an order of magnitude . The position signal from 3 - D piezo stage is in the order of a few volts , whereas the voltage of the QPD channels is in the order of millivolts . Secondly , the net DAQ bandwidth of 600 kHz is shared between the input terminals and would reduce from 200 to 100 kHz per channel if the DAQ is used to record the 3 - D piezo stage location . 23 . The TDMS ﬁle format is a proprietary ﬁle type developed by National Instruments . TDMS ﬁles are not readily imported into other workspaces . Currently , we use a custom developed LabVIEW VI to convert TDMS data to text ﬁles to facilitate analysis within MATLAB and other software packages . A better option is to translate the TDMS ﬁle to the Hierarchical Data Format version 5 ( HDF5 ) ( www . hdf5 . org ) which is becoming the standard for technical data . This format can be imported , and manipulated by many free wares and proprietary software packages , including MATLAB .

Chapter 13 Fractal Analysis of Cancer Cell Surface Igor Sokolov and Maxim E . Dokukin Abstract Fractal analysis of the cell surface is a rather sensitive method which has been recently introduced to characterize cell progression toward cancer . The surface of ﬁxed and freeze - dried cells is imaged with atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) modality in ambient conditions . Here we describe the method to perform the fractal analysis speciﬁcally developed for the AFM images . Technical details , potential difﬁculties , points of special attention are described . Key words Fractal analysis , Cancer progression , Physics of cancer 1 Introduction Fractal geometry is one of the intriguing mathematical constructs . If a surface is fractal , its geometry repeats itself periodically at different scales [ 1 ] . These complex disorderly patterns are typically formed under far - from - equilibrium conditions [ 2 ] , or emerge from chaos [ 1 ] . Examples of fractal shape range from the large - scale structure of the universe [ 3 ] to forms of continental coastlines [ 4 ] , trees [ 5 ] , grain structures of many metals , ceramics and minerals [ 6 ] , clouds [ 7 ] , and even some artistic creations [ 8 ] . Some biological tissues [ 9 ] show fractal patterns . Recently a fractal structure of chromatin has been used to show how the cell’s nucleus holds molecules that manage nuclear DNA in the right location [ 10 ] . The idea of a possible connection between cancer and fractals ( self - afﬁnity ) has been suggested in a number of works [ 11 – 13 ] . It was proposed that disbalance of various biochemical reactions , which is typically associated with cancer , could result in chaotic formation of various geometrical characteristics of cancer , and con - sequently , appearance of fractal geometry because chaos typically results in the appearance of fractals . It was indeed demonstrated that tumor vasculature and antiangiogenesis demonstrated explicit fractal behavior [ 12 , 14 ] . Cancer - speciﬁc fractal behavior of tumors Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 13 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 229 at the macroscale has been recently found when analyzing the tumor perimeters [ 9 , 15 ] . Fractal geometry was also found in the structure of tumor antiangiogenesis [ 12 , 14 ] . Similar analysis at the micro - and submicron scales was done in both neoplastic and normal cells . Various morphometric analyses have been applied to analyze individual cells [ 16 , 17 ] and cell nuclei [ 18 ] . One - dimensional perimeter of cross sections of cells or cell nuclei was analyzed in those works . However , the fractal analysis at the micro - and submicron scales did not show the transition to fractal when cells become cancerous . Both cancer and normal cells demon - strated good fractal behavior , although with different fractal dimen - sion [ 17 , 18 ] . Moreover , those works were descriptive in nature ; they were based on the analysis of the previously well - known morphometric features of the cell boundary ( pseudopodia ) and did not provide any noticeable improvement in identiﬁcation of cancer cells [ 19 ] . Recently it has been shown that the analysis of fractal dimen - sion of cell surface imaged with atomic force microscopy ( AFM a - tomic force microscopy ) showed a strong segregation between normal , immortal ( precancerous ) , and malignant human cervical epithelial cells [ 20 , 21 ] . However , fractal dimension can be calcu - lated for any surface , not necessarily fractal ( fractal dimension can formally be assigned to any surface ) . The study of the emergence of fractal geometry in itself on the cell surface has been reported just recently [ 22 , 23 ] . It was shown that there was a strong correlation between multi - fractality ( a parameter introduced to characterize the deviation from fractal ) and the stage of progression to cancer . Multi - fractality is reaching zero , which corresponds to a simple or ideal fractal , at the stage when immortal cells turn into cancerous . Moreover , cancer cells deviate from ideal fractal with the increase of the number of divisions of cancer cells , which is typically associated with the cancer progression . Here we describe the method to perform the fractal analysis which was used in the AFM works cited above . This method was speciﬁcally developed for the AFM images . Non - resonant AFM modes ( as well as HarmoniX ) allow recording maps of topography ( surface image ) , rigidity , adhesion , dissipation energy , maximal ( peak ) force , and sometime phase ( shift of the oscillating cantilever due to the interaction with cell surface ) . For the purposes of fractal analysis , it was found that the adhesion map channel gives the best results [ 20 ] . Technical details , potential difﬁculties , points of special atten - tion are described . Application of this method is demonstrated for human cervical epithelial cells at different stages of progression to cervical cancer , from normal to immortal ( premalignant ) , to malignant . There are different methods of processing images to analyze their fractal behavior . Fractal analysis is typically done by calculating 230 Igor Sokolov and Maxim E . Dokukin self - correlation function . A power law dependence of the self - correlation function on the geometrical scale is a deﬁnitive behavior of fractal . The fractal behavior can also be tested by utilizing Fourier analysis [ 24 ] . Because the Fourier analysis of two - dimensional images is typically present at any AFM software , we found the latter method to be particularly suitable to do the fractal analysis of AFM images . Here we describe the method and technical steps needed to do the analysis . 2 Materials 2 . 1 Cell Preparation 1 . Freeze - dryer ( see Note 1 ) . 2 .

Fractal Analysis of Cell Surface 231 3 Methods For the purpose of fractal analysis , individual cells should be used ( see Note 6 ) . Cells can be either cultured and attached to a culture dish , or extracted from a tissue , or scratched from a tissue surface , or collected from body ﬂuids ( see Note 7 ) . 3 . 1 Cell Preparation for AFM Study 1 . Wash cells cultured in tissue culture dishes two times with PBS ( see Note 8 ) . Drain all excessive liquid and add 4 ml of Karnovs - ky’s ﬁxative solution . Keep for 12 h at 4 (cid:1) C . Remove Karnovs - ky’s ﬁxative solution and wash with PBS . 2 . Drain all excessive liquid and add 4 ml of PBS . Keep for 2 h at room temperature . 3 . Repeat step 2 . 4 . Drain all excessive liquid and add 5 ml of deionized ( DI ) water . Keep for 12 h at 4 (cid:1) C . 5 . Wash cells with 5 ml of DI water twice before freeze drying ( see Note 9 ) . Keep cells in 5 ml of DI water at 4 (cid:1) C before freeze - drying . 6 . Place cells in DI water in the freezer with temperature (cid:3) 40 (cid:1) C or below to freeze cells ( see Note 10 ) . After a sample is frozen transfer it in to the freeze - dryer and keep it there until sample is completely dried ( see Note 11 ) . 7 . After freeze - drying , keep cells in a desiccator ( see Note 12 ) . After removing from desiccator cells should be imaged under AFM directly in culture dishes ( see Note 13 ) . 3 . 2 AFM Imaging of Cell Surface 1 . Calibrate the deﬂection sensitivity and the spring constant of the AFM cantilever ( see Note 14 ) . 2 . Estimate the radius of the AFM probe : Collect the image of the standard TIP001 tip - check sample . Use NanoScope Analysis or SPIP software to reconstruct shape / radius of the AFM probe ( see Notes 15 – 17 ) . 3 . Locate the AFM probe over the surface of a cell using an optical microscope which is typically built in or attached to virtually all AFMs . 4 . Choose appropriate load force ( also called “peak force” or max - imum force ) which should be kept constant through all imaging . The key criteria for the choice of the right force are ( a ) indepen - dence of the fractal dimension of small variations of the load force , and ( b ) stability of the image after multiple scanning of the same area ( see Notes 18 and 19 ) . 5 . Choose an appropriate imaging speed : The most accurate way to estimate the maximum possible speed which gives still no 232 Igor Sokolov and Maxim E . Dokukin artifacts is to calculate the fractal dimension as a function of scanning speed . It is advisable to work with the speeds which are at least 10 % lower than the value at which one can see a clearly visible change of the fractal parameter ( see Note 20 ) . To increase the imaging speed , the bidirectional scanning mode can be used ( see Note 21 ) . 6 . Collect the images at the scan size of 10 (cid:4) 10 μ m ( at the resolution of 512 (cid:4) 512 pixels ) ( see Note 22 ) . An example of human cervical epithelial cancer cell imaged with HarmoniX mode is shown in Fig . 1 . 3 . 3 Fractal Analysis 1 . Choose which type of map / image to analyze . It is recom - mended to work with adhesion images since the map of adhe - sion allows to detect the surface feature on the cell surface down to 1 nm [ 22 ] . This is substantially higher than features resolved on the height images of cells . Moreover , the analysis of the height images show that both normal and cancer cells are perfect fractals . Whereas the analysis of maps of adhesion demonstrate a substantial deviation from fractal behavior for different cell phe - notypes ( Fig . 2 ) ( see Note 23 ) . 2 . Split each 10 (cid:4) 10 μ m 2 cell map into four 5 (cid:4) 5 μ m 2 zoomed images . This can be done with a built in AFM NanoScope Analysis software or within SPIP directly . The zoomed images only without or with small number artifacts should be processed ( see Notes 24 and 25 ) . 3 . Use each zoomed image , which is obtained as described in step 2 , to calculate Fourier magnitude using the following equation : Fig . 1 A 10 (cid:4) 10 μ m 2 example of an AFM scan of the surface of a human cervical epithelial cancer cell . ( a ) Height image ( the vertical scale is 2 μ m ) and ( b ) adhesion map ( the vertical scale is 25 nN ) are shown . The images / maps were recorded with 512 (cid:4) 512 pixels with 0 . 4 Hz scan speed Fractal Analysis of Cell Surface 233 F u ; v ð Þ ¼ X N x (cid:3) 1 x ¼ 0 X N y (cid:3) 1 y ¼ 0 z x ; y ð Þ exp (cid:3) i 2 π ux = N x þ vy = N y (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) = N x N y ; ð 1 Þ where z x ; y ð Þ is the value of the image at a point / pixel ( x , y ) , N x , N y are the number of pixels in the x , y directions and u and v are Fourier coordinates . Such calculation can be done through the Fourier transformation using SPIP software ( see Note 26 ) . 4 . Calculate the average of the Fourier magnitude h F ( Q ) i spectra ( or self - correlation function ) in polar coordinates as follows : F Q ð Þ h i ¼ 1 π ð π 0 F Q cos φ , Q sin φ ð Þ d φ : ð 2 Þ Here the averaged Fourier magnitude h F ( Q ) i is a function of reciprocal space Q ( inverse lateral size of the geometrical features on the AFM image— L ) . The linear behavior of h F ( Q ) i in the log – log scale ( or F Q ð Þ h i e Q b ) is a deﬁning feature of fractals . By analyzing h F ( Q ) i one can deﬁne if the surface of interest is fractal or not . Figure 3 shows the results of processing of a map of adhesion through the Fourier transform of SPIP software . Initi - ally the Fourier transform is done at a range of polar angles . To average the magnitude , we averaged the spectra along radial lines as an average cross section for the polar angles from 0 to 180 for the top half - plane as shown in Fig . 3a . The averaged ( one - dimensional ) Fourier spectrum , the Fourier magnitude , as a function of reciprocal space Q is shown in Fig . 3b . 5 .

Dokukin important parameter of fractals , the fractal dimensionality , by doing a linear ﬁtting in log – log scale using log F ð Þ ¼ log a ð Þ + b log Q ð Þ in the reciprocal range of interest . The slope b of the ﬁtting curve deﬁnes the fractal dimension α as follows α ¼ 2 (cid:3) b ( see Note 27 ) . 6 . Calculate the multi - fractality parameter : ﬁnd the fractal dimen - sion for two reciprocal intervals , and subtract one fractal dimen - sion from the other . For the example of human cervical epithelial cells , those intervals were 0 . 1 – 5 and 5 – 25 μ m (cid:3) 1 . The speciﬁc point to split the entire interval of reciprocal parameter Q can be found for other cell types by plotting h F ( Q ) i in log – log scale ( Fig . 3b ) . The split point should be seen as a break position between two straight lines ( see Note 28 ) . 4 Notes 1 . Labconco Lyph - Lock 12 freeze dryer was used . 2 . Karnovsky’s Fixative—Paraformaldehyde - Glutaraldehyde Solution Ready to mix - and - use kit contains : 16 % Formalde - hyde 2 (cid:4) 10 ml ampoules ; 50 % Glutaraldehyde 1 (cid:4) 10 ml ampoules and Sodium Phosphate Buffer , 0 . 2 M 1 (cid:4) 50 ml vial . Final mixture is 78 ml with 5 % Glutaraldehyde , 4 % Paraformaldehyde in 0 . 064 M Buffer . This mixture is extremely hypertonic , with an osmolarity of more than 2000 mOsm . 3 . Any AFM which can operate in a special HarmoniX or one of the non - resonant modes can be used . The latter include Sca - nAssyst , PeakForceQMN ( by Bruker ) , HybriD ( by NT - MDT ) , Fig . 3 ( a ) A typical Fourier magnitude spectrum map and ( b ) the results of the averaging of the Fourier magnitude h F ( Q ) i over the polar angle Fractal Analysis of Cell Surface 235 Digital Pulsed Force Mode ( by Witec ) , and others . Speciﬁc examples shown in this chapter were obtained with a Nano - scope Dimension 3100 / Dimension Icon ( Bruker / Veeco , Inc . , Santa Barbara , CA ) atomic force microscopes equipped with Nanoscope V controller . HarmoniX , PeakForceQMN , and Ringing modes of AFM operation were utilized . 4 . The Ringing mode attachment can be used to accelerate the AFM imaging almost ten times . 5 . Bruker ScanAssyst cantilevers for imaging in air were used for PeakForceQMN and Ringing modes ; HarmoniX standard can - tilevers were utilized for HarmoniX mode . 6 . Though there is no principal limitation to use the tissue with exposed cell surfaces . 7 . To increase lateral resolution of the AFM images , and to mimic the processing of cells in the screening liquid cytology tests , cells should be ﬁxed and dried before the imaging with AFM . To avoid drying artifacts , freeze - drying should be used . Cells collected in suspension should be freeze - dried on glass slide or plastic culture dish . 8 . For speciﬁc examples shown in this chapter cells were cultured in 60 mm tissue culture dishes . The cells were analyzed when the cells reach < 50 % conﬂuency . 9 . The cell samples thus prepared can be preserved for several weeks with DI water at 4 (cid:1) C before freeze drying . 10 . Cell should be frozen rapidly to avoid ice crystals formation . Though freezer with temperature of (cid:3) 40 (cid:1) C can be used it is preferable to use temperature of (cid:3) 80 (cid:1) C . 11 . Fractal parameters can depend on cell drying time [ 20 ] . To check the inﬂuence of a different drying time on the results of fractal analysis , one cancer cell line and one normal cell strain were investigated . Culture dishes with ﬁxed cells were ﬁlled with a similar amount of water , fast frozen , and kept in a freeze - drier for 2 , 4 and 12 h ( the minimal time ( 2 h ) was chosen by visible absence of any traces of water or ice in culture dishes . After that , the cells were immediately imaged using AFM . There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference observed in the fractal dimension parameter for samples dried different times . 12 . The dried samples can be preserved at least for several weeks in a desiccator . 13 . There is concern that samples can be rehydrated after freeze - drying if ambient humidity is high . The cells should be imaged under AFM directly in culture dishes after not more than 30 min after removing from desiccator . Although humidity can be controlled during the AFM scanning , the role of 236 Igor Sokolov and Maxim E . Dokukin humidity can be evaluated . As has been shown and tested by Dokukin and coworkers [ 20 ] , the fractal geometry recovered from the AFM images is rather stable up to a relative humidity of 60 % . The imaging here should be done below that level and samples should be kept in ambient conditions for not more than 4 h . 14 . The deﬂection sensitivity has to be calibrated when measuring a deﬂection of the AFM cantilever on a rigid surface , for example , a clean silicon wafer or glass slide . The spring con - stant of the AFM cantilever can be found using the thermal tuning , an option which exist in virtually all new AFMs . The HarmoniX mode requires an additional calibration of the tor - sional spring constant . 15 . To avoid possible error coming from probe contamination / damage , the probe radius should be checked before and after each experiment . 16 . The calibration of the AFM probe allows for precise control of the acquisition of data which is used for fractal analysis . Although we demonstrate that the precise knowledge of the data acquisition parameters is not critical for the fractal analysis , it is still important to be within some allowable range . There - fore , the above steps are important to verify if the data acquisi - tion ( scanning parameters , such as the load force and probe radius ) are within the allowable range . 17 . Fractal parameters may depend on the AFM probe radius . Although possible , it is practically inconvenient to try to keep the radius AFM apex the same for all imaging . Variation of the radius of curvature of commercially available sharp AFM probes is typically within 5 – 20 nm . If we assume no speciﬁc chemical interactions between the AFM probe and the cell surface ( it can be seen / veriﬁed by the lack of speciﬁc force signatures [ 25 ] , which is not typically observed when scanning cells ) , the adhesion force could be simulated as a contact of two spherical surfaces [ 26 ] . Using this approximation , it is possible to recover the change of the adhesion at each particular pixel for different probe radii . Figure 4 shows the predicted depen - dence of the fractal dimension and multi - fractality parameter on the value of R t / 10 nm , where R t is the radius of the AFM probe . One can see that both parameters of the modeled images are virtually constant for a wide range of the probe radii . Speciﬁcally , both parameters change within 1 % when an initial probe diameter of 10 nm changes within the range of 4 – 18 nm . Another point to take into consideration for the probe radius is possible probe contaminations . As one can judge from the weak dependence of the probe radius , small Fractal Analysis of Cell Surface 237 contaminations on the AFM probe that do not change the probe radius substantially are not dangerous for robust mea - surements of fractal properties . In previously reported mea - surements [ 20 – 22 ] , no statistically detectable change of fractal parameters was observed when imaging at least 30 cells . Con - taminated probes typically can be cleaned with water plasma cleaners and reused . All large contaminations are easily detect - able by a sudden change of the image during scanning . 18 . Although the particular characteristic of the fractal geometry , the fractal dimension is almost independent of the load force , it is a good idea to keep this force constant through all imaging . That way one can see possible artifacts related to abnormal change of the sample or quality of the AFM probe . As to the speciﬁc value of the load force , it depends on the chosen scanning mode . For example , this force was equal to ~ 40 nN when doing HarmoniX mode imaging [ 20 ] . PeakForce QNM and Ringing mode allowed working with much smaller forces ( less than 1 nN ; though the used load force of 5 nN is prefera - ble for the cell scanning ) . 19 . The load force is to be chosen by the AFM operator . Therefore , independence of our results from this parameter is important to verify . It is quite natural to expect weak dependence on the fractal parameters on the load force because the values of adhesion should not depend on it . In reality , the adhesion may depend on it because of viscous retardation of the probe - surface contact upon the probe withdrawal . Therefore , it is advisable to test the limits of the load forces suitable for the fractal study for each particular sample type . One can study the dependence of multi - fractality as the function of the load force as follows : The same area of the sample surface is scanned with different forces of increasing values ( it is important to return back to the minimum force to verify repeatability to avoid the Fig . 4 Dependence of the fractal dimension ( a ) and multi - fractality ( b ) on the coefﬁcient R t / 10 nm , where R t is the AFM probe radius ( Adapted with permission from [ 22 ] ) 238 Igor Sokolov and Maxim E . Dokukin artifacts due to potential damaging of the sample by the action of the AFM probe ) . Then the images are tested with one of the fractal parameters . For example , while working in HarmoniX mode and using standard HarmoniX AFM cantilevers , one can get reliable imaging starting from the scan force of ~ 20 nN and until the force reaches ~ 105 nN . The dependence of the multi - fractality on the scan force is shown in Fig . 5 . One can see that the multi - fractality is practically independent of the scanning force . The standard deviation of calculated multi - fractality is just 0 . 01 . To avoid the danger of sample destruction by the AFM probe , it is advisable not to use too high forces . On the other hand , the use of two small force may result in unstable scanning ( this is particularly true when scanning in HarmoniX mode ) . As an example , a range of 30 – 70 nN was found to be the best for a robust imaging for the time needed to get several scans of the cell surface . 20 . The speed of data acquisition is typically chosen as a compro - mise between the speed and quality ( excessively fast scanning will create artifacts that should be avoided ) . Obviously the faster speed is preferable to complete imaging faster . As to the speciﬁc numbers , when working with human epithelial cells , the maximum scanning speed without artifacts was 0 . 5 Hz ( 2 s per line ) when working in HarmoniX mode , 0 . 1 Hz for the PeakForce QNM mode , and 0 . 5 – 1 Hz for the Ringing mode . Although the HarmoniX and Ringing modes are both faster , the Ringing mode seems to demonstrate higher long - term imaging stability . As it was mentioned above the HarmoniX Fig . 5 The multi - fractality of adhesion maps of a cancer cell calculated on the same surface imaged with different load forces ( Taken with permission from [ 22 ] ) Fractal Analysis of Cell Surface 239 mode requires an additional ( torsional ) calibration of the AFM cantilever . In addition , the feedback of controlling HarmoniX scanning is not as robust as the one of the non - resonant modes . For a particular example of human cervical epithelial cells , the scanning may require retuning the scanning parameters when changing from one area of the sample to another ( for example , another cell ) . The PeakForce QNM mode very rarely required retuning the scan parameters when moving to another part of the sample . The Ringing mode ( which is essentially an advanced data processing add - on for nonresonant modes ( like PeakForce QNM ) uses the feedback of the parent nonres - onant mode , and therefore , inherits its stability . 21 . A standard AFM scanning records only one part of each scan line ( either the left to right or right to left ) . This is done to avoid an internal creep of the AFM scanner . Although it is technically possible to record both forward and backward lines , and there - fore , scan twice faster ( the so - called bidirectional recording ) , it is not recommended for the majority of scanners because it creates substantial artifacts . One can , however , check if the artifacts are substantial , for example , by comparing the value of the fractal dimension calculated for the same area recorded with and without bidirectional scanning . If the difference is within a tolerable level , it is advisable to use bidirectional scan - ning to accelerate the image recording . 22 . This is a typical size of cell images studied so far . The key criteria for choosing the right scan size and the digital ( pixel ) resolution are ( a ) the size should cover the largest possible area of the cell without artifacts , and ( b ) the lateral size of each pixel has to be 20 nm or smaller ( while smaller numbers are prefera - ble for the analysis , they increase the time of acquisition ) . 23 . It was shown that the AFM height images are not sensitive enough to segregate between cancer and normal cells [ 21 ] . 24 . It is allowed to taking into account some small artifacts some - times found on the cell surface ( such artifacts are typically obvious features on many cell surface images ) . Technically it can be done , for an example of calculating of fractal dimen - sion , by taking the mean value of four values obtained for the zoomed images . If the amount of artifacts is too high , up to 1 (cid:4) 1 μ m zoomed images could still be processed because the fractal dimension doesn’t depend on the area . The images used for surface analysis should not be processed by any other way than mentioned above . Many software have a default initial preprocessing ( like ﬂattening and plane ﬁt ) to make images easy to see . These default preprocessing has to be switched off . 240 Igor Sokolov and Maxim E . Dokukin 25 . Dependent on the growth conditions , some cells can grow well - developed ﬁlopodia . Figure 6 demonstrates an example of such features imaged on the cell surface with HarmoniX mode . A ﬁlopodium can substantially alter fractal parameters . Fig . 6 ( a ) Phase and ( b ) adhesion maps of normal cell surface with ﬁlopodia ( large ﬁbers seen on the surface ) Fractal Analysis of Cell Surface 241 Figure 7 demonstrates that the change of fractal dimension of the adhesion maps depends on ﬁlopodia . We compare fractal dimension for a partially covered and clear membrane . Figure 7 shows the fractal dimension calculated on the surface of the same cells averaged over the entire surface ( including ﬁlopodia ) and only over the area without ﬁlopodia . One can see that the presence of ﬁlopodia can result in a shift of fractal dimension - ality to a higher value . We found that it was possible to avoid the issue by zooming to the area without ﬁlopodia ﬁbers ( it was possible to ﬁnd such areas between 1 (cid:4) 1 to 5 (cid:4) 5 μ m 2 ) . The fractal dimensionality is well deﬁned and rather homogeneous on such areas within each cell . 26 . Here it becomes clear why the Fourier analysis is more suit - able to ﬁnd the self - correlation function needed to deﬁne fractal behavior . This is because the coordinates ( x , y ) are discrete , and therefore , the calculation of the self - correlation function would require extrapolation which is quite a com - plicated procedure ( in particular , when the noise has to be Fig . 7 A representative example of fractal dimensionality calculated on the surface of the same cells ( a ) only over the area without ﬁlopodia , and ( b ) averaged over the entire surface ( including ﬁlopodia ) 242 Igor Sokolov and Maxim E . Dokukin taken into account ) . The Fourier coordinates ( u , v ) are con - tinuous , and consequently , one doesn’t have the problem for extrapolation . 27 . Such a deﬁnition of the fractal dimension gives α ¼ 2 for ﬂat and α ¼ 3 for inﬁnitely rough surfaces , which correspond to a common deﬁnition of dimensionality of space . Strictly speaking , it is impossible to obtain the exact fractal behavior from the maps observed for any realistic surface . According to the classical deﬁnition of fractal , the power dependence of the magnitude which deﬁnes the fractal should be observed in the entire geometrical ( inﬁnite ) scale of Q . However , this is impractical because of natural limitations [ 27 ] due to the ﬁnite size of data and ﬁnite digitalization / pixelization of any image . It implies that the fractal geometry cannot be even considered for the size of geometrical features L ( ¼ Q (cid:3) 1 ) that are either greater than the size of the recorded image or smaller than the size of each pixel . It is worth noting that , one could technically consider inﬁnite scales by extrapolating Eq . 2 to arbitrary scales . It should be clear that such extrapolation would be an artifact of the use of the Fourier method . For example , if the image of 5 (cid:4) 5 μ m 2 is recorded with 256 (cid:4) 256 pixels , the fractal behavior can be analyzed for L ranging between ~ 5 μ m and 20 nm ( ~ 5 μ m / 256 ) . Thus , the fractal geometry described in this work is deﬁned within these limits . 28 . The analysis of F Q ð Þ h i e Q b shows that the fractal behavior can be nontrivial . Speciﬁcally , it may show different values of b and different scales . Such behavior is called multi - fractal [ 27 , 28 ] . This is shown in Fig . 2 in which the function h F ( Q ) i is plotted in log – log scale . A straight line in the log – log scale of Fig . 2 indicates the power law dependence , i . e . , fractal . One can see from Fig . 2 that the magnitude can be approximated as a straight line in the log – log scale on the whole range of scales Q ( reciprocal of the range L ¼ 5 μ m – 20 nm ) for only some immortal and malignant cells . For other pre - malignant , most of the malignant , and all normal cells , the magnitude A ( Q ) plotted in log – log scale can be well - approximated as a broken straight line with the break point at Q ~ 5 μ m (cid:3) 1 ( L ~ 200 nm ) . This multi - fractal geometry can be described with two fractal dimensions . A parameter of “multi - fractality” was introduced in [ 22 ] to describe the deviation of the observed geometry from a simple fractal . It is equal to the difference between two fractal dimensions below and above a break point . In the other words , the multi - fractality is deﬁned as the change of the fractal dimension when deﬁned above and below Q ¼ 5 μ m (cid:3) 1 . The multi - fractality is zero for the ideal ( simple ) fractal . Fractal Analysis of Cell Surface 243 Acknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge partial funding for this work by NSF CMMI - 1435655 .

Dawidczyk , and Peter C . Searson Abstract Quantitative evaluation of nanoparticle delivery to a tumor site can be invaluable for cross - platform comparison , a consideration not currently taken into account by many in the ﬁeld of cancer nanomedicine ( Dawidczyk et al . , Front Chem 2 : 69 , 2014 ) . Standardization of measured parameters and experimental design will facilitate nanoparticle design and understanding in the ﬁeld . Here , we present a broadly applicable in vivo protocol for preclinical trials of nanomedicines , including pharmacokinetic modeling and recommendations for parameters to be reported for nanoparticle evaluation . The proposed protocol is simple and not prohibitively mouse - heavy , using procedures that are not overly complicated or difﬁcult to learn , yet is a powerful way to analyze the effectiveness of new cancer nanomedicines against standard or more developed ones . Key words Tumor uptake , Nanoparticles , Enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect , Drug delivery systems , Pharmacokinetics 1 Introduction In order to compare nanoparticle - based drug delivery systems , it is critical to maintain consistency across experimental evaluations . Unfortunately , it is commonplace to design experiments around qualitative clinical efﬁcacy instead of around quantitative metrics . In the following chapter , we put forth a generic protocol for cross - platform evaluation of pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation of nanoparticle delivery systems [ 2 ] . These parameters are impor - tant in determining in vivo behavior as well as providing a quanti - tative standard by which nanoparticle delivery systems for cancer treatment can be compared . Though many groups use in vivo techniques for nanoparticle evaluation of nanomedicines , few include quantitative pharmacoki - netic analysis . The intersection of pharmacokinetics and common metrics of preclinical trials , such as survival , can yield important insight into possible efﬁcacy in human models . The second key Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 14 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 247 component of the protocol we put forth is inclusion of a three - compartment pharmacokinetic model to ﬁt the data collected in the proposed experiments . The three compartments in this model are : ( 1 ) vasculature , ( 2 ) healthy tissue , and ( 3 ) the tumor itself . Inclu - sion of the tumor as the third compartment allows quantitative analysis of tumor accumulation kinetics for any nanoparticle deliv - ery system . The nanomedicine is initially injected into the vascular compartment and transport between the compartments is deﬁned by the rate constants k p , k d , k epr , and k b ( where k p and k d are the rate constants for entry and exit into normal tissues , and k epr and k b are the rates of entry and exit from a solid tumor mass , respectively ) , while elimination by other pathways is deﬁned by the rate constant k el ( Fig . 1 ) . Identiﬁcation of these rate constants provides insight into mechanisms of action , including potential for negative side effects , as well as tumor accumulation . Adoption of this protocol and associated modeling will allow for the eventual development of cross - platform design rules by which the ﬁeld of cancer nanomedicine can continue to innovate and grow . Deﬁning design rules for new nanoparticle delivery systems is difﬁcult because standardized protocols do not exist . To adequately compare new nanoparticles , it becomes imperative to have identical testing methods . For example , tumor accumula - tion of gold nanoparticles cannot be compared with accumulation in liposomes if one study is performed in subcutaneous colorectal adenocarcinoma and the other in orthotopic breast adenocarci - noma . Unfortunately , current practice for nanoparticle evaluation not only varies tumor type but time point , success metric ( i . e . , tumor accumulation vs . mouse survival ) , among others . With the adoption of protocols like this one as standards , cross - platform comparison of nanoparticle types will be possible . Fig . 1 Schematic illustrating the role of rate constants related to both a two ( a ) and three ( b ) compartment pharmacokinetic model , where transport between the compartments is deﬁned by the rate constants k p , k d , k epr , and k b and elimination by other pathways is deﬁned by the rate constant k el 248 Luisa M . Russell et al . The protocol proposed below is intended as a limited set of additional experiments to allow direct comparison and benchmark - ing of different drug delivery systems . It is because of this that relatively few time points are proposed . The results from this pro - tocol are intended to be reported as a standard characterization metric , not as a study unto itself . To that end , an in vivo mouse protocol is described in which nanoparticles are administered to mice bearing LS 174T subcuta - neous xenografts . LS 174T is a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line . This cell line is chosen for the standardized experiment not only because of its relatively fast growth time and ease of culture , but also because tumors produced by inoculation of these cells display highly leaky vasculature without any notable negative impact on the mice such as formation of metastatic tumors or cachexia . The particular mouse type is chosen for its ability to grow subcutaneous tumors as well as their even temperament and lack of fur , making them ideal candidates for possible ﬂuorescent imaging . Time points for measurement are chosen based on the peak tumor accumulation ranges of many nanoparticle delivery systems administered to tumor - bearing mice [ 1 , 2 ] . In brief , nude mice subcutaneously xenografted with LS 147T cells are injected with a standardized number of nanoparticles , then sacriﬁced at each time point for quantitative analysis of both blood concentration and quantitative tumor uptake . A modeling method is then be described to which the quantitative data may be applied for kinetic analysis of tumor uptake ability ( see Note 1 ) . 2 Materials 1 .

Solve for the kinetic rate constants k epr and k b , assuming k el , k p , and k d remain constant . Using a numerical iterative ﬁtting process written in MatLab in which deviation of points from the predicted ﬁt is minimized , values for k epr and k b can be identiﬁed from a best ﬁt derived from a three - compartment pharmacokinetic model . For a MatLab code to solve for these rate constants given amounts of drug in the blood and tumor over time , refer to Wong et al . [ 3 ] . In the case speciﬁc to the protocol above , this code is modiﬁed to include the ability to ﬁt to data by the size of the error bars . Brieﬂy , code is written to both produce a best ﬁt to the data for blood concentration and tumor accumulation based on this three - compartment pharmacokinetic model and to produce ﬁgures to display these ﬁts against the original data . To accomplish this , ﬁrst the time points that the mice were analyzed at are deﬁned as a variable . The ﬁrst step in derivation of the rate parameters , as mentioned above , is to determine the rate parameters corresponding to the case without the tumor ( k p , k d , and k el ) . We can then apply these values to the ﬁt with the tumor , modifying the ﬁt using the rate parameters that apply to a tumor model ( k epr and k b ) . In the no tumor case , we deﬁne concentrations over time in mg / L , convert to amount by multiplying by the volume ( in this case , 0 . 00053 L of mouse blood plasma ) , and also deﬁne the corresponding error bars in the same way . We then deﬁne A1 , A2 , alpha , and beta from ﬁts of two exponential curves to the data in Excel . The rate constants k p , k d , and k el are then solved for as described above , with the ﬁt being graphed alongside it according to the form of Eq . 4 . The same set of parameters is deﬁned for the tumor - bearing mice , and both are graphed together as shown in Fig . 1 . To ﬁt to the tumor accumulation data , an iterative ﬁtting process is written in MatLab . Brieﬂy , amounts of doxorubicin in the tumor over time are entered as a variable , with another variable corresponding to their error bars . Ranges are then set for modiﬁca - tion of k el , k epr , and k b with start , end , and step widths . A for - loop is then written to minimize the distance of the ﬁt from the points , taking into account the size of the error bars at each point . The tumor accumulation and corresponding ﬁt are then graphed as in Fig . 2 , in amount ( mg ) versus time ( h ) , and the code is ﬁnished by displaying the values it calculated for k b , k epr , k el , and the minimum total error . Quantitative Evaluation of the EPR Effect 253 5 Notes 1 . This protocol was developed by the authors to allow compari - son and benchmarking of nanoparticle delivery systems in pre - clinical trials . Though several aspects of the protocol above can and should be modiﬁed based on the requirements of each nanoparticle type , the overall methodology should remain con - sistent to enable comparison of tumor accumulation of nano - particles developed for cancer imaging / therapy . Above all , to enable comparison , the same mouse model should be used , with measurements of the same metrics at the same time points . This protocol is designed for comparison of nanoparticle deliv - ery systems for treatment of solid tumors , where tumor accu - mulation is mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention effect . For comparison of nanoparticle delivery sys - tems in other tumor types , similar protocols could be developed . 2 . Tumor accumulation of liposomes remote - loaded with doxo - rubicin can be quantiﬁed via HPLC analysis . However , this method of quantitative analysis might not be most suited to inorganic nanoparticle delivery systems , for which other meth - ods ( including ICP - MS ) are more suitable .

Part IV Nanotechnology for Prevention and Detection / Imaging of Cancer Chapter 15 Nanotechnology - Based Cancer Vaccine Aws Alshamsan Abstract Nanotechnology offers invaluable tools to tailor cancer vaccines in order to generate robust antitumor immune response . Among the types of vehicles for cancer vaccines , nanoparticles ( NPs ) are easier to produce with better scalability . Several nanostructures have been discussed in literature as potential delivery systems for cancer antigens . Here , we focus on polymeric NPs fabricated from poly ( D , L - lactic - co - glycolic ) acid ( PLGA ) . We describe how to prepare and characterize such NPs loaded with ovalbumin ( OVA ) antigen and immune adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPLA ) . We further describe methods to test the immune efﬁcacy of such NPs in vitro and in vivo . Key words Cancer vaccine , Nanoparticle ( NPs ) , Poly ( D , L - lactic - co - glycolic ) acid ( PLGA ) , Immuno - therapy , Dendritic cell ( DC ) 1 Introduction Immunotherapy has emerged as a new therapeutic modality of cancer with promises of higher speciﬁcity and longevity outcomes . It is based either on supplementing effector immune components ( passive immunotherapy ) , e . g . , monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , or generating robust immune response ( active immunotherapy ) by cancer vaccine . The latter carries a potential of eliciting multifaceted antitumor immune response accompanied with immunological memory [ 1 ] . Cancer vaccine types include : ( 1 ) cell - based vaccines such as ex vivo manipulated tumor cells , activated peripheral - blood or bone - marrow derived monocytes , dendritic cells ( DCs ) , or lymphocytes , ( 2 ) subunit antigen such as synthetic peptide , puriﬁed peptide , or tumor cell lysate , ( 3 ) viral and plasmid vectors expressing desired antigens , and ( 4 ) nanotechnology - based cancer vaccine , which involves fabricated nanosystems that deliver cancer - speciﬁc antigens to target antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) especially DCs [ 2 ] . Several nanotechnology - based delivery systems have been introduced in the literature as potential carriers for cancer antigens [ 3 , 4 ] . Among them , polymeric nanoparticles ( NPs ) offer greater Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 15 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 257 versatility with respect to manipulating physical and chemical proper - ties in order to accommodate a wide range of antigens and immune adjuvants and to enhance DC targeting , as well as higher scalability potential [ 5 ] . Here , we describe how to prepare NPs made of poly ( D , L - lactic - co - glycolic ) acid ( PLGA ) loaded with chicken ovalbumin ( OVA ) protein and monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPLA ) . PLGA NPs gained special interest as a vaccine delivery system due to its biocompatibility , biodegradability , ability to encapsulate a wide range of antigens and immune adjuvants , and most importantly the ability of cross - presentation and reac - tivation of tumor - suppressed DCs [ 6 – 8 ] . This chapter will focus on how to prepare PLGA NPs by emulsiﬁcation solvent - evaporation technique and how to characterize such NPs for their size , surface charge , and surface morphology . We also describe in detail how to generate and maintain a primary culture of bone - marrow derived dendritic cells ( BMDC ) from hematopoietic stem cells that were isolated from mouse bone marrow . More - over , we describe how to isolate CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cells from mouse spleen and how to test the immunologic efﬁcacy of OVA / MPLA - loaded PLGA NPs in vitro and in vivo using B16 - OVA melanoma bearing mice . 2 Materials All glassware , small animal surgery kits , and general laboratory equipment must be sterile , autoclaved , or disinfected .

Dissolve 200 μ g MPLA in 100 μ L of 1 : 4 methanol : chloroform mixture in an autoclaved glass vial and add to the organic phase containing PLGA ( see Note 12 ) . 2 . Pour the aqueous phase on the organic phase and emulsify using probe sonication for 15 s at level 2 out of 10 or 20 out of 100 . 3 . Pour the primary water - in - oil ( w / o ) emulsion on 2 mL of PVA solution ( 9 % w / v in PBS ) and emulsify by probe sonication for 45 s at level 4 out of 10 or 40 out of 100 ( see Note 13 ) . 4 .

Leave in stirring for 3 h then centrifuge at 40 , 000 (cid:2) g for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C . 5 . Wash the collected nanoparticles twice with cold deionized water using the same centrifugation conditions . Free - dry and store at (cid:4) 20 (cid:3) C ( Fig . 1 ) . 6 . To determine the loaded amount of OVA protein , disperse 5 mg of PLGA NPs in 3 mL solution of 0 . 1 M NaOH contain - ing 5 % ( w / v ) sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) . Keep the suspen - sion in high - speed orbital shaking overnight . Then , centrifuge at 15 , 000 (cid:2) g for 10 min and collect supernatant .

Calculate OVA loading in PLGA NPs as Amount of OVA in mg Amount of PLGA in mg and expressed as ( w / w ) . The latter is used to calculate the dose of PLGA NPs needed for in vitro and in vivo treatment . 7 . To measure particle size and surface net charge , employ dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) and zeta potential measurement , 260 Aws Alshamsan respectively , using suitable particle size / zeta potential analyzer such as Zetasizer Nano ZS or Brookhaven 90Plus Particle Size Analyzer ( see Note 14 ) . Study particle morphology by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Fig . 2 ) . 3 . 2 Generation of Bone - Marrow Derived Dendritic Cells ( BMDC ) 1 . Pin a mouse to dissection board ( see Note 6 ) , pour 70 % ethanol , and cut skin across thigh to ankle . Expose the bone by removing the entire muscle layer . To free the femur bone , cut just above the joints and pick the femur gently with tweezers . 2 . Soak the isolated femur in 70 % ethanol for 2 min for disinfec - tion , then soak in sterile PBS for 30 s to wash . Fig . 1 Preparation of OVA / MPLA - loaded PLGA NPs by emulsiﬁcation solvent - evaporation technique . Schematic depiction represents sequential processes of NP - vaccine preparation by emulsiﬁcation solvent - evaporation technique . It is worth noting that changing the parameters of the process such as sonication time , stirring time , organic solvent , etc . may signiﬁcantly affect NP characteristics Fig . 2 Characterization of PLGA NPs . ( a ) Dynamic Light Scattering shows average effective diameter ( hydrodynamic diameter ) of 552 . 6 nm ( see Note 15 ) . ( b ) Scanning Electron Microscope image shows uniform spherical structures with smooth surface ( see Note 16 ) Nanotechnology - Based Cancer Vaccine 261 3 . Carefully cut both ends of the femur bone with scissors . Flush the bone marrow with 1 mL sterile PBS using a 1 cc BD ™ U - 100 insulin syringe with a 26 G ( 0 . 45 mm diameter ) needle into a 50 mL sterile tube . Repeat the process for at least three times ( see Note 17 ) . 4 . Add sterile PBS to the ﬂushed marrow to make the ﬁnal volume 30 mL . 5 . Filter the cell suspension through 70 μ m cell strainer ( mesh ) into a new sterile 50 mL tube . Centrifuge the ﬁltrate at 300 (cid:2) g for 5 min . Remove the supernatant and suspend the pellet in 10 mL of sterile PBS , then perform cell count with hemocytometer . From each femur , 1 – 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 7 cells should be obtained . 6 . Centrifuge as mentioned above and suspend the pellet in com - plete RPMI - 1640 culture medium . 7 . Seed 2 (cid:2) 10 6 cells in 10 mL complete culture medium contain - ing 20 ng / mL GM - CSF per 100 mm petri dish ( see Note 7 ) . 8 . At day 3 , add to the plate another 10 mL of complete culture medium containing 20 ng / mL GM - CSF . 9 . At day 6 , withdraw 10 mL from the petri dish and replace with fresh complete culture medium containing 20 ng / mL GM - CSF ( see Note 18 ) . 10 . At day 7 , harvest semi - adherent cells by pipetting up and down gently using 5 mL sterile pipette . DC population in harvested cells will be around 70 % based on CD11c expression [ 9 , 10 ] . 11 . Pulse the BMDC on day 6 with OVA - MPLA NPs , OVA NPs , and soluble OVA . Calculate PLGA NPs dose based on 1 μ g / mL OVA concentration per dish . Negative controls include groups pulsed with PBS , soluble MPLA , and empty NPs . 12 . After overnight incubation , harvest , irradiate , wash , and trans - fer BMDC groups to 96 - well plates at 2 (cid:2) 10 4 BMDC per well in at least three replicates per group . 3 . 3 In Vitro T Cell Activation 1 . Pour 5 mL of culture medium in small petri dish and keep in ice . 2 . Euthanize then soak OT - I mouse ( containing CD8 þ T cells ) and OT - II ( containing CD4 þ T cells ) mouse in 70 % ethanol . 3 . To harvest spleen , make a small snip in the mouse abdomen using sterile scissors and remove the skin to expose the perito - neal cavity . The spleen is the lengthened slightly curve - shaped organ located in the left superior abdominal quadrant . Cut through the muscle layer and remove the intact spleen using tweezers . 262 Aws Alshamsan 4 . Put the spleen in the dish and cut it to two pieces . Put each piece between two rough surfaces of frosted microscope slides and smash it to disrupt the splenocytes . Use a dropper to wash the smashed cells into the dish and discard any connective tissue . 5 . Suspend isolated splenocytes three times in the dish using 5 mL syringe with 18 G needle . Repeat the process with 22 G and 26 G needles , sequentially ( see Note 19 ) . Transfer the cell suspension into 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube . Wash the dish with 5 mL culture medium and add it to the 15 mL tube . 6 . Isolate CD8 þ T cells and CD4 þ T cells with EasySep ™ mouse CD4 þ T cell and CD8 þ T cell isolation kits ( StemCell ™ Tech - nologies ) ( see Note 9 ) . 7 . Coculture isolated T cells with BMDC groups at 2 (cid:2) 10 5 T cells per well . This protocol will produce BMDC : T cell ratio of 1 : 10 . You can optimize the ratio to the desired response but coculture each ratio on a separate plate . 8 . After 72 h , perform microculture tetrazolium assay ( see Note 10 ) . Quantify the produced color by spectrophotometry at the appropriate wavelength . This depends on the tetrazolium reagent you are using . The color intensity is proportionally related to T cell proliferation . 9 . In another set of experiment , measure the protein levels of IL - 2 and IFN - γ in coculture supernatants over time range ( 0 – 96 h ) by ELISA . 10 . After 96 h , collect 1 (cid:2) 10 6 cells from each well , wash twice with sterile PBS at 300 (cid:2) g for 5 min , and suspend the pellet in FACS buffer . 11 . To each sample , add 0 . 25 μ g anti - mouse CD16 / CD32 mAb in order to block Fc γ RIII / Fc γ RII receptors to prevent nonspe - ciﬁc binding . Incubate for 30 min at 37 (cid:3) C in 5 % CO 2 . 12 . Wash and suspend the pellet in FACS buffer and appropriately stain relevant T cell surface markers , i . e . , CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD90 with ﬂuorescence - conjugated mAb ( see Note 20 ) . Also appropriately stain previously mentioned groups with activa - tion markers CD11a , CD44 , CD62L , and CD69 . 13 . After 30 min incubation at 37 (cid:3) C , wash and suspend the pellet in FACS buffer and perform ﬂow cytometry immediately or keep at 4 (cid:3) C for no longer than 6 h after ﬁnal washing . If ﬂow cytometry will be performed at a later time point , ﬁx the cells by the addition of formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde to ﬁnal concentration 2 – 4 % . 3 . 4 Vaccination of Tumor - Bearing Mice 1 . In 25 cm 2 tissue culture treated plastic ﬂask , seed B16 - OVA cells ( see Note 21 ) in complete RPMI - 1640 culture medium Nanotechnology - Based Cancer Vaccine 263 supplemented with 500 μ g / mL Geneticin ® reagent ( G - 418 ) ( see Note 11 ) . 2 . At 90 % conﬂuence , subculture according to American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) recommendation . 3 . After three passages , isolate 90 % conﬂuent culture and sus - pend 1 (cid:2) 10 5 cells in 100 μ L normal saline ( 0 . 9 % NaCl ) or PBS . 4 . Inoculate suspended B16 - OVA cells subcutaneously ( s . c . ) in the upper right ﬂank of C57BL / 6 male mice ( 4 – 6 weeks of age ) ( see Note 5 ) . 5 . Observe the inoculation site daily and measure tumor size throughout the experiment with Vernier caliper ( also known as Vernier scale ) . Record the longest diameter and the diameter perpendicular to the longest length of the tumor mass in order to calculate tumor area and volume at the end of the experi - ment [ 11 ] . 6 . After 3 days , randomly assign ﬁve mice to each treatment group . Immunize each group s . c . in the lower right ﬂank with corresponding treatment OVA - MPLA NPs , OVA NPs , or empty NPs . Calculate PLGA NPs dose based on 20 μ g OVA per dose . Give booster immunization dose at day 7 and at day 10 . Use a group of untreated tumor - bearing mice as control . 7 . On day 21 , euthanize all mice and shave around tumor mass then take a photo of each group for comparison . 8 . Harvest spleens and draining lymph nodes of each group and prepare single - cell suspensions as mentioned earlier . 9 . Harvest and record the tumor weight of each mouse . Calculate the percentage of mice in each group that have tumor less than 0 . 3 g . 10 . Similar to preparing splenocytes single - cell suspension , smash isolated tumors between two rough surfaces of frosted micro - scope slides and prepare single - cell suspensions . 11 . Filter the cell suspension through 70 μ m cell strainer into a new sterile 50 mL tube . Centrifuge the ﬁltrate at 300 (cid:2) g for 5 min . 12 . Measure the protein levels of TNF - α , IL - 12 , IFN - γ , IL - 2 , IL - 6 , and VEGF by ELISA and normalize the results to the total protein weight available in each sample by micro BCA protein assay . 13 . Wash the precipitated cells twice with sterile PBS and suspend 1 (cid:2) 10 6 cells in FACS buffer . 14 . Properly stain cells for CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 surface marker to detect percentage of tumor - inﬁltrating lymphocytes by ﬂow cytometry ( see Note 20 ) . 264 Aws Alshamsan 15 . Prepare single - cell suspension from isolated spleens and lymph nodes as mentioned above . From each group , isolate CD8 þ T cells , wash twice with PBS at 300 (cid:2) g for 5 min and suspend 1 (cid:2) 10 7 cells / mL in complete culture RPMI - 1640 medium ( see Note 9 ) . 16 . Coat 96 - well ﬁlter plate with 100 μ L / well IFN - γ - speciﬁc cap - ture antibody at 4 (cid:3) C overnight prior to T cell isolation . 17 . Decant coating solution and wash the plate twice with sterile PBS ( 200 μ L / well ) then add culture medium ( 200 μ L / well ) for 1 h at room temperature to block the plate . 18 . Decant medium and place 1 (cid:2) 10 6 isolated CD8 þ T cells ( almost equal to 100 μ L per well ) . Consider 5 – 8 replicates per group to reduce standard error . 19 . Stimulate cells with 20 μ M CD8 þ recall positive epitope OVA 257 – 264 ( SIINFEKL ) , H - 2 b restricted irrelevant epitope , or free medium as negative control . Incubate plates at 37 (cid:3) C for 18 h in 5 % CO 2 . 20 . After 18 h , wash the plate three times with 0 . 05 % Tween 20 in sterile PBS ( washing solution ) . 21 . Add 100 μ L anti - mouse IFN - γ detection antibody diluted according to manufacturer’s instruction . Incubate at room temperature for 2 h . 22 . Wash four times with washing solution . 23 . Add streptavidin - HRP reagent and keep at room temperature for 45 min . 24 . Wash three times with washing solution then twice with PBS . 25 . To each well , add 100 μ L freshly prepared AEC Chromogen / Substrate solution . 26 . Stop the reaction after 30 min by washing three times with distilled water . Fig . 3 Testing nanoparticle - based vaccine strategy on tumor - bearing mouse model . Schematic depiction represents sequential processes of inducing antitumor immune response . Site of tumor inoculation and rout of vaccination may signiﬁcantly affect the immune response outcome Nanotechnology - Based Cancer Vaccine 265 27 . Dry the plate and read the developed spots using proper ELI - SPOT reader ( Fig . 3 ) ( see Note 22 ) . 4 Notes 1 . Individually wrap surgical tools before autoclaving . Open the tools inside laminar - ﬂow biosafety cabinet to ensure aseptic environment . Disinfect the mouse before dissection by 70 % ethanol . 2 . PLGA is provided as ester - terminated or acid - terminated forms . It also comes in several molecular weights and monomer ratios . They are NOT interchangeable because their half - life , drug release kinetics , and drug encapsulation efﬁciency are different . Prepare an aliquot of PLGA crystals in a small vial and apply gentle stream of nitrogen gas in the aliquot vial for 15 s to prevent oxidation . Cover the vial , seal it with PARAF - ILM ® , put in Ziploc ® bag with desiccant silica gel crystals , and store at (cid:4) 20 (cid:3) C . Also store the original PLGA stock at (cid:4) 20 (cid:3) C . 3 . A 10 (cid:2) PBS stock can be prepared in 1 L by multiplying all salts amounts by a factor of 10 . Alternatively , premixed PBS powder and solution are commercially available . However , checking and adjusting pH of the ﬁnal solution is always needed . 4 . PVA viscosity varies according to the molecular weight . This change in viscosity will signiﬁcantly affect the size and encapsu - lation efﬁciency of PLGA NPs . Dissolving PVA may take up to several hours . Swollen polymer tends to stick to the stirring bar . Remove any sticking pieces for rapid dissolution . 5 . Make sure you are certiﬁed to handle laboratory animals in your institution . Always wear gloves when handling laboratory animals . C57BL / 6 mice ( the black ones ) tend to bite the handler ﬁngers and they are generally more aggressive than BALB / c mice ( the white ones ) . Mice used in this protocol must be of the same gender . Male mice were reported to be inferior to female mice in immunologic functions [ 12 ] . They are also more aggressive than female mice and tend to ﬁght when they are put in a cage . Do not put more than ﬁve animals per cage . Mice older than 6 weeks are not recommended because mouse immune response to particulate antigens is signiﬁcantly depressed with aging [ 13 ] . 6 . Polystyrene foam racks of the 50 mL centrifuge tubes can serve as dissection board . 7 . Do not use tissue - culture treated dishes because these dishes will enhance cell adherence . Following this protocol , BMDC are the semi - adherent population that you can harvest by simple suspension . If you perform this experiment with tissue - culture 266 Aws Alshamsan treated cells , the BMDC population will adhere to the plate and will not be distinguished from adherent ﬁbroblasts . 8 . If heat - inactivated FBS is not available , you can inactivate the serum by immersing the FBS bottle in 56 (cid:3) C water bath for 30 min . To do that , a control water bottle with identical beginning temperature must be co - immersed to monitor the raise in temperature using suspending thermometer . Begin timing as soon as the temperature reaches 56 (cid:3) C . Heat inacti - vation is not necessary for most cell cultures . On the contrary , it may adversely affect cell growth if done improperly . It is also less critical with FBS as compared with with fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . In any case , the serum used , whether FBS or FCS , must be tested for endotoxin . 9 . Puriﬁcation of B and T cells from splenocytes cell suspension can be done by treatment with a lysis buffer ( 156 mM NH 4 Cl , 10 mM KHCO 3 , 100 μ M EDTA ) followed by nylon wool puriﬁcation that can be assembled in the lab . From our experi - ence , commercial isolation kits are more reproducible and give cleaner cell population . 10 . Tetrazolium compounds used in cell viability assay are usually 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bro - mide ( MTT ) , 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 5 - ( 3 - carboxy - methoxyphenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - sulfophenyl ) - 2 H - tetrazolium ( MTS ) , 2 , 3 - bis - ( 2 - methoxy - 4 - nitro - 5 - sulfophenyl ) - 2 H - tetrazolium - 5 - carboxanilide ( XTT ) , or water soluble tetrazolium ( WST ) salts series [ 14 ] . MTT reduction produces insoluble formazan crystals that require further solubilization with DMSO or iso - propyl alcohol . On the other hand , reduction of MTS , XTT , or WST series produces formazan products that are directly solu - ble in culture medium [ 15 ] . Tetrazolium reagents are unstable in light so make sure to reduce light exposure during work . 11 . This antibiotic is added to culture medium in order to select cells that are stably transfected with neomycin resistance gene . The concentration used in this protocol is 500 μ g / mL . How - ever , you can titrate up to 1 mg / mL . 12 . Dissolving PLGA in organic solvents may take around 30 min . To enhance this , weigh the needed amount and keep at room temperature for 30 min in autoclaved glass vial before pouring the organic solvent on it . PLGA tends to stick to the vial wall so try to lower the weighed PLGA with a small spatula to the bottom of the vial . Wash any sticking remnant with the amount of organic solvent poured on PLGA . 13 . We often put the beaker in ice during secondary emulsiﬁcation step in order to reduce heat generation . Excessive heat can adversely affect drug encapsulation as well as particle size . Carefully , rotate the beaker or vial around the immersed Nanotechnology - Based Cancer Vaccine 267 sonication tip but be careful not to accidentally touch the tip with your ﬁngers . The sonication tip should not touch the vial’s or beaker’s walls . 14 . NPs suspension must be diluted in the range of 0 . 0001 – 1 % ( v / v ) to be measure by DLS . 15 . The measured particle size is based on the particle - occupying volume rather than scattering intensity . Volume size distribu - tion assumes unimodal homogenous distribution of particles . If your sample contains two size populations , you should employ intensity size distribution . 16 . It is not uncommon to get different size measurement results between DLS and SEM because of the different size - detection principles . However , any discrepancy should not be vast . 17 . Make sure not to remove the top of the femur . Carefully cut the tip of the bone and do not go closer to the middle so you do not lose or infect the cells . As you ﬂush the bone , the color will change from dark red to light pale color . Keep ﬂushing until the color does not get any lighter . 18 . Withdrawing and supplying culture medium must be through slow pipetting at the edge of the dish to avoid disturbing the cells because BMDC may mature just by mechanical agitation . 19 . Be careful when changing the needles not to poke your ﬁngers . If the suspension is jammed in the syringe , it means there is a chunk of aggregated cells stuck in syringe tip . Slowly move the plunger back and forth to breakdown aggregates . 20 . The ﬂuorescent - tag choice is based on the desired ﬂow cyto - metry analysis , e . g . , if two - colored dot plot is sought for CD3 and CD4 , you can choose anti - CD3 conjugated with a ﬂuor - ophore that is detected on FL1 channel such as ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) and anti - CD4 conjugated with a ﬂuor - ophore that is detected on FL2 channel such as phycoerythrin ( PE ) or FL3 channel such as peridinin chlorophyll ( PerCP ) . FL2 – FL3 compensation is hard sometimes depending on the ﬂuorophore and the ﬂow cytometer . Compensation is more critical with three - color analysis . In such case , do not hesitate to ask for the service of a ﬂow cytometry technician . 21 . The cell line must be tested for mycoplasma . 22 .

Banerjee , Vrushali Khobragade , and Jayant Khandare Abstract Detection of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) in the blood circulation holds immense promise as it predicts the overall probability of patient survival . Therefore , CTC - based technologies are gaining prominence as a “liquid biopsy” for cancer diagnostics and prognostics . Here , we describe the design and synthesis of two distinct multicomponent magnetic nanosystems for rapid capture and detection of CTCs . The multifunc - tional Magneto - Dendrimeric Nano System ( MDNS ) composed of an anchoring dendrimer that is conju - gated to multiple agents such as near infrared ( NIR ) ﬂuorescent cyanine 5 NHS ( Cy5 ) , glutathione ( GSH ) , transferrin ( Tf ) , and iron oxide ( Fe 3 O 4 ) magnetic nanoparticle ( MNP ) for simultaneous tumor cell - speciﬁc afﬁnity , multimodal high resolution confocal imaging , and cell isolation . The second nanosystem is a self - propelled microrocket that is composed of carbon nanotube ( CNT ) , chemically conjugated with targeting ligand such as transferrin on the outer surface and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles in the inner surface . The multicom - ponent nanosystems described here are highly efﬁcient in targeting and isolating cancer cells thus beneﬁting early diagnosis and therapy of cancer . Key words Cancer diagnosis , Circulating tumor cell , Nanosystem , Multicomponent , Chemical conjugation 1 Introduction Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide and metas - tasis causes more than 90 % of deaths in cancer patients [ 1 ] . Cancer metastasizes due to the migration of tumor cells from the primary site and spread to other parts of the body , via lymph system or bloodstream , where they form a secondary tumor [ 1 ] . Circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) are imperative biomarkers for examining cancer prognosis as well as a real - time diagnosis and detecting them sup - ports monitoring of drug resistance during the anticancer treat - ment and in clinical trials [ 2 – 4 ] . However , the detection of CTCs from blood has been challenging because of their extreme low occur - rence ( 10 – 100 per mL ) among a high number ( 10 9 cells per mL ) of hematologic cells in blood . Thus , to efﬁciently obtain CTCs from Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 16 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 271 peripheral blood , various platforms have been developed such as immunomagnetic beads , microﬂuidic - based platforms , and microﬁl - ter devices [ 1 , 5 , 6 – 14 ] . At present , CellSearch ® technology ( Veridex , LLC , Raritan , NJ , USA ) is the only FDA approved technology for enumeration of CTCs from cancer patients . This technology relies on the immunomagnetic separation of cells based upon their expression of cell surface antigens , such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ) . However , most of these approaches encounter drawbacks of slow capture , prolonged processing and less efﬁcacy [ 15 ] . Here , we describe the methods for synthesis of two different immunomagnetic separation - based nanosystem platforms namely MDNS [ 16 ] and a CNT based magnetic microrocket system ( Tf - CNT - Fe 3 O 4 ) [ 17 ] for speciﬁc targeting and rapid isolation of CTCs ( Fig . 1 ) . The MDNS nanosystem consists of ﬁve functional components : ( 1 ) transferrin ( Tf ) , to speciﬁcally target transferrin receptors ( TfRs ) overexpressing cancer cells ( 2 ) iron oxide ( Fe 3 O 4 ) nanoparticles for magnetic isolation , ( 3 ) imaging probe cyanine 5 N - hydroxysuccinimide ( Cy5 NHS ) to enable high - resolution imaging of the isolated CTCs , ( 4 ) fourth generation ( G4 ) dendri - mers to facilitate simultaneous attachment of multiple functional groups ( e . g . , Tf , Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and Cy5 ) and also to increase the dispersibility of the nanosystem , and ( 5 ) glutathione ( GSH ) to act as a multifunctional reactive linker . This versatile MDNS system exhibited : ( 1 ) rapid ( ~ 5 min ) and efﬁcient ( ~ 80 % ) capture of TfR þ cancer cells from an artiﬁcial CTC - like suspension , ( 2 ) magnetic Fig . 1 Schematic illustration of ( a ) MDNS is designed by using multi - components , such as PAMAM G4 dendrimer , Tf , iron oxide nanoparticles , and imaging probe cyanine 5 ( reproduced from [ 16 ] ) and ( b ) Tf - CNT - Fe 3 O 4 nanosystem is designed by using multi - components , such as CNT , iron oxide nanoparticles , and Tf ( reproduced from [ 17 ] ) 272 Shashwat S . Banerjee et al . isolation of the captured cells from peripheral blood cells and ( 3 ) subsequent high - resolution imaging . While the microrocket system is fabricated by conjugating three functional components : ( 1 ) CNT , ( 2 ) iron oxide ( Fe 3 O 4 ) , and ( 3 ) the Tf ligand ( Tf ) ( Fig . 2 ) . The microrocket platform possesses unique advantages such as : ( 1 ) instantaneous propellant motion of microparticles ( downward and upward ) due to the formation of O 2 bubbles which helps in rapid recognition and capture ( ~ 5 min ) of TfR (cid:2) overexpressing ( TfR þ ) cancer cells , ( 2 ) speciﬁc targeting ability due to presence of Tf ligand , ( 3 ) magnetic isolation of the captured cells owing to the presence of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles , and ( 4 ) large surface area and internal volume allows multiple components to be loaded onto the nanotube . 2 Materials 2 . 1 Chemicals 1 .

Key words Bioluminescence , Fluorescence , In vivo imaging , Glioblastoma , Optical imaging 1 Introduction Optical imaging strategies , such as ﬂuorescence and biolumines - cence imaging , are non - invasive , in vivo whole body imaging tech - niques utilized to study cancer . Both modalities are based on the detection of photons emitted from either the organism , as in bioluminescence imaging , or from a ﬂuorophore , as in ﬂuorescence imaging . Photon concentrations up to picomolar and femtomolar are detectable by whole animal - imaging systems [ 1 ] . Optical imag - ing is widely used in preclinical work because of its ease of use and cost - friendliness . It also provides the opportunity to study animals and biological responses longitudinally over time . Important con - siderations include depth of tissue penetration , photon scattering , absorption and the choice of light emitting probe , all of which affect the resolution ( image quality and data information ) and the signal to noise ratio of the image . Bioluminescence is the emission of light photons from an animal , which in some organisms is a naturally occurring event . Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 17 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 283 This phenomenon has been exploited by researchers to study dif - ferent molecular processes in cells and whole organisms . Cells are genetically engineered to express a bioluminescent reporter enzyme ( e . g . , ﬁreﬂy luciferase ) and are subsequently treated with the enzyme’s substrate ( e . g . , luciferin ) , which results in the release of photons upon catalysis [ 1 ] . Bioluminescence imaging techniques emit photons in the visible light range , which inherently suffer from poor tissue penetration , making this technique currently only suit - able for small animal imaging [ 2 ] . One major advantage of biolu - minescence imaging is the absence of background signal , or noise . This is because animals inherently do not express luciferase . In this chapter , we outline the use of bioluminescent imaging to determine the tumor burden in an orthotopic mouse model of glioblastoma . Fluorescence is the emission of a photon from a ﬂuorophore after excitation by a laser . Different ﬂuorophores absorb and emit photons at different wavelengths inﬂuencing tissue penetration and , consequently , the signal to noise ( SNR ) ratio , making the choice of ﬂuorophore a critical design parameter . Fluorophores that emit light in the far red ( > 650 nm ) or Near Infra - Red ( NIR ) range are optimal for in vivo imaging due to better tissue penetra - tion and reduced scattering effects . The choice of excitation source is also important as ﬂuorophores are only able to absorb photons at a speciﬁc wavelength . Table 1 illustrates which type of ﬁlters is optimal for a handful of commonly used ﬂuorophores in small animal imaging . Unlike in bioluminescence , ﬂuorescence imaging does suffer from autoﬂuorescence . Hair , blood , and tissues can be excited by the same source as the ﬂuorophore and consequently also emit photons , reducing the contrast of the image [ 3 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Most new ﬂuorescence imagers work with band pass ﬁlters to restrict the wavelengths of both excitation and emission light to ameliorate the contribution of autoﬂuorescence to the signal . Often , background noise is quantiﬁed by measuring the ﬂuores - cence arising from the animal before the introduction of any ﬂuor - ophores , which can then be used to unmix the autoﬂuorescence signal in subsequent imaging steps from the true ﬂuorescence signal . As an example , we describe how to use ﬂuorescence imaging to track a chemotherapeutic delivery nanocarrier conjugated with a ﬂuorophore to determine its localization in vivo . In vivo whole body imaging is an invaluable tool when devel - oping new cancer drugs . In this chapter , we elaborate step by step on how we combine bioluminescence and ﬂuorescence imaging techniques to study the delivery of drug particles to an orthotopic glioblastoma in a mouse . First , genetically altered tumor cells expressing the luciferase enzyme are injected into mice brains . After 7 days ( average ) , the mice are injected with luciferin and the tumor burden can be determined by a bioluminescence imaging system . When the tumors are of the appropriate size , approximately 1 – 3 cm , we ﬁrst determine autoﬂuorescence by imaging the mice ( prior to the injection of the nanocarriers ) on both the ventral and 284 Emilie McKinnon et al . dorsal sides with overlapping sets of ﬁlters ( primarily orange and red ﬁlters ) . The example used herein is of mice treated with drugs conjugated with a Dylight 680 ﬂuorophore . After the intravenous tail vein injection of the nanocarrier , the animals are longitudinally imaged at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 24 h time points to acquire the ﬂuorescence signal and this is correlated to the location of the nanocarriers and their relative intensity . The mice are euthanized after the 24 h time point and subsequently all the organs are harvested and imaged post mortem . It is important to note that the results arising from these techniques are either qualitative or relative to another image . Currently , it is not possible to exactly quantify the amount of ﬂuorescence arising from the underlying tissues [ 4 ] . Furthermore , keep in mind that both bioluminescence and ﬂuorescence imaging techniques are planar imaging modalities , meaning that they create two - dimensional topographic images , superimposing the signal ( s ) arising from the underlying tissues .

Next click on Find Component Images . Several images will appear ; these are the different spectral components found by the component analysis ( see Note 11 ) . Click on the image Fig . 5 Spectral library for athymic nude mouse before the injection of ﬂuoro - phore . Channel 1 represents the spectra of the conjugated ﬂuorophore . Channels 2 and 3 are autoﬂuorescence spectra from the mouse and Channel 4 is the autoﬂuorescence of the stage 294 Emilie McKinnon et al . boxes that appear to contain relevant autoﬂuorescence chan - nels , i . e . , different organs , skin , eyes ( Fig . 6a ) . Next click on Find Spectra ( see Note 12 ) . Give the channels an appropriate name ( preimage _ eyes , preimage _ liver , . . . ) and assign them a spectrum number ( see Note 9 ) . Give all the autoﬂuorescence channels the same color , for example white . Click on Transfer to Library and close the window ( Fig . 5 ) . 4 . Reselect the ﬂuorophore channel ( most likely Channel 1 ) , which is now unchecked and click Unmix . Different windows will open , which represent the amount of ﬂuorescence present in each of the chosen channels . These images are represented in gray scale , which means the whiter the values ; the higher the ﬂuorescence . Looking at the highlighted areas will tell you which part of the animal are captured by which channel . Fig - ure 6b shows an example of a channel that represents the autoﬂuorescence from the brain / skull and the major organs . The window that has a border color matching the color chosen for the ﬂuorophore channel represents the signal arising from the ﬂuorophore . Because the pre - image animal has no ﬂuoro - phore , this signal should be as close to zero as possible ( see Note 13 ) . 5 . Open a Compare Image window ( Tools > Compare Images ) and drag the window that represents the ﬂuorophore signal into one of the empty spaces of the Compare Image window ( Fig . 7 ) . This will give you an idea of the highest value of signal in the image ( here , 0 . 00408 ) . Our goal is to set this value as low as possible . Keep this Compare Image window open . 6 .

Putting the camera further from the sample results in a wider ﬁeld of view . When imaging bigger plates or more animals , a longer ﬁeld of view is called for ( Fig . 12 ) . Fluorescence and Bioluminescence Imaging of Cancers 299 2 . Imaging can either be done manually by setting a timer and acquiring an image every minute or by setting up an imaging sequence ( Add and Acquire Sequence ) . While setting up an imaging sequence , the number of segments and the time delay needs to be chosen appropriately . For example , 6 seg - ments with a delay of 3 min will take a total of 6 images one at 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , and 18 min after the addition of luciferin ( Fig . 3 ) . When working with animals , the animals must be completely anesthetized before starting because for the entire duration of the imaging sequence , the door cannot be opened . Furthermore , only the ﬁrst photograph taken is used for the projection of the luminescence so you will not be able to see if the mice changed positions . Fig . 12 Field of view options for whole animals on the PerkinElmer IVIS spectrum . Modiﬁed from PerkinElmer , IVIS Spectrum product note Fig . 11 Left Amount of ﬂuorescence captured by the different major excised mice organs after euthanasia ( 24 h after drug injection ) . Right Fluorescence arising from the excised brain , the brain on the left was treated with a glioblastoma targeted drug particle , while the brain on the right was untargeted 300 Emilie McKinnon et al . 3 . Exposure time , binning and f / stop ( lens aperture ) are settings on the machine that control the sensitivity of the measurement . There is a ﬁne balance between sensitivity and measuring noise . At higher exposure times , more photons are collected , but this diminishes throughput and increases the chances of measuring noise . Be aware that at very high exposure times , long exposure times can saturate the camera with lumens and no further differences can be measured . The lens aperture determines the amount of photons that reach the CCD camera . F / 1 is a wide open lens which is the default setting for bioluminescent studies . Lastly , the amount of binning will determine the resolution of the image . Binning combines multiple pixels into a single pixel . Higher binning numbers increase the sensitivity of the image but simultaneously lower the resolu - tion of the image and reduce the exposure time . The interplay between all these parameters will determine the quality of the ﬁnal image . Using auto - exposure , the machine will try and determine the most optimal settings for the experiment . In general , start with an exposure time of 1 min . If the signal is too bright , lower the exposure time . If the signal is not detectable , increase the exposure time . Keep in mind that when making a comparison over multiple time points , the exposure time needs to be consistent . For this reason , more so in ﬂuorescence imaging , images are acquired with more than one exposure time . This is because initially it is not known how long of an exposure time is needed to get a signal from a small amount of drugs ( preferentially in the tumor ) . To prevent having to redo the experiment , acquire several different ﬂuorescent images with exposure times ranging from 500 to 4000 ms . 4 . Ideally , the tumor is between 1 and 3 cm in size . If the tumor is too small , there will not be enough vascularization for appro - priate drug delivery and tumors above 3 cm in size are consid - ered inhumane . Time between implantation and imaging is highly dependent on the type of tumor cell implanted . On average with glioblastoma U87 - MG cells , we begin imaging at day 7 to determine the tumor size . 5 . This step is dependent on the type of reporter gene used . When using luciferase , the bioluminescent activity usually peaks within 20 min after injection . 6 . Exercise caution when reimaging your animals because a back - ground signal can arise from residual luciferin within the mouse . Pre - imaging the animal becomes increasingly more important here . 7 . As a general rule of thumb , start with the concentration that you hypothesize results in an appropriate drug delivery . From this concentration , both add and subtract a logarithm and Fluorescence and Bioluminescence Imaging of Cancers 301 determine the ﬂuorescence from all three dilutions . First of all , this step will conﬁrm that your particles are detectable by the instrument and allow you to determine the emitting spectrum . Furthermore , by determining the amount of ﬂuorescence in each of the dilutions , the efﬁciency of conjugation can be assessed as well . For example , when 1 μ M of particles results in only moderate ﬂuorescence , it is a good indicator that the conjugation step was not optimal . 8 . When studying drug delivery to the brain , we are often pre - sented with a relatively low signal arising from the brain as compared compared to the signal coming from organs involved in drug elimination . To deal with this , we often acquire an additional image in which we cover up the body of the mouse with black paper and only measure the ﬂuorescence coming from the head . Note , that in this case , you also need to pre - image the covered mouse to optimally determine the autoﬂuor - escence signal for accurate processing ( Fig . 13 ) . 9 . When transferring spectra to your library , make sure nothing is already stored under the spectrum number that you choose . The program will overwrite the spectra . For example , if you already have a ﬂuorophore spectrum stored in Channel 1 , make sure you start numbering your autoﬂuorescence channels from Channel 2 and beyond . 10 . There are two ways of identifying the different autoﬂuores - cence channels . We recommend the use of the RCA as Fig . 13 Fluorescence hotmap from mice orthotopically implanted U87 - luciferase cells , intravenously injected with either targeted or untargeted drug particles . Mice were covered with white paper to suppress the ﬂuorescence arising from the rest of the body 302 Emilie McKinnon et al . described in the Methods sections . Although when RCA fails , another possibility is to more precisely draw your own chan - nels . Namely , you can ﬁll in the channels yourself by clicking on the Draw icon ( next to the channels on the left of the screen ) and draw a line in the different areas that you think have different ﬂuorescence spectra . When you are done , click Unmix and continue from Subheading 3 . 8 , step 4 . 11 . On the top of the screen it says “You can click once for Signal and twice for background . ” Technically , this animal has no ﬂuorescence , so the image only consists of background signals . However , the auto - ﬂuorescence is most likely made up of different channels , as you can only choose one background channel , we will treat everything here as a signal . 12 . Find Spectra will show you the different spectra arising from the signals that you chose . If some of the spectra overlap , it is better to choose one of the signals . These images represent the same ﬂuorescence pattern and the program will have a hard time unmixing the signals in the following steps . 13 . When there are parts of the image highlighted in the ﬂuoro - phore channel , this signal needs to be removed . More channels need to be added , representing these channels that were cap - tured in the ﬂuorophore channel . This will remove them from this channel and put them in their respective autoﬂuorescence channel . You can either go back to the RCA or click on the images that resembles the region that you are looking for . For example , if you see the stage and part of the skin light up in the ﬂuorophore channel ( Fig . 14a . ) , you need to go back to the RCA button and choose a signal that looks like the autoﬂuor - escence of the stage and / or skin . Another possible way of removing these channels is by clicking on the Draw icon of the next available channel to add a new channel . Here we can manually add a channel for skin and for the stage by drawing on them ( Fig . 14b ) . Click Unmix again and see if the ﬂuorophore channel is almost empty . Repeat these steps until you get a satisfactory result . Note that It will be very hard to remove all the background noise . 14 . If you accidentally close the Compare Image window , reload the pre - image ( Load Cube ) and click Unmix . Drag the image corresponding to the ﬂuorophore to the ﬁrst box in the Com - pare Image window ( Tools > Compare Images ) . This will be your reference point as this image represents native ﬂuores - cence in the ﬂuorophore channel . 15 . Note how the scale has changed to the highest value found in all the images and how the program rescales the images . The background noise becomes barely visible anymore because it has much lower values than the values inside the images that we Fluorescence and Bioluminescence Imaging of Cancers 303 added . Sometimes an image has a spot with very high ﬂuores - cence , which will drastically change the scale . For example , sometimes the ﬂuorescence at the injection site at time point 1 can overshadow high amounts of ﬂuorescence at the later time points . When this occurs use a different compare image window ( Tools > Compare Images ) and remove the image at this time point . 16 . The ROI can be moved by right clicking on the image and selecting the Move Region option . This may be necessary if the animals were placed on the exact same location between the different study time points . 17 . Depending on the ﬂuorescence intensity , sometimes the image does not display the full body contour , which can make it difﬁcult to place your ROI . A possible solution is to change the contrast at the Display tab ( for example , to (cid:4) 1 ) . After placing the ROI , the original image contrast can be restored by clicking on Restore to Default ( Fig . 15 ) . Fig . 14 ( a ) After unmixing , for each channel in the spectral library an image opens representing the amount of ﬂuorescence captured by that channel . This ﬁgure shows ﬂuorescence captured by the ﬂuorophore channel before injection of the ﬂuorophore . This channel is contaminated by autoﬂuorescence of both skin and stage . In pre - injected animals this channel needs to be as close to zero as possible . ( b ) To remove ﬂuorophore channel contamination assign extra channels to the spectral library for autoﬂuorescence arising from background sources such as skin and stage 304 Emilie McKinnon et al .

However , the moderate sensitivity of conventional ELISA limits its applications in many cases where the concentrations of biomarker are very low , such as cancer diagnosis . Here we describe an ultrasensitive colorimetric assay based on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) - catalyzed hydrolysis reaction , whose products trigger the aggregation of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs ) , causing a distinct color change of the solution from red to purple . This enhanced colorimetric immunoassay offers extremely high sensitivity and speciﬁcity . In this study , we employed enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) , the major cause of hand , foot , and mouth disease ( HFMD ) , as a model to evaluate the analytical performance of the plasmonic immunoassay . Key words Gold nanoparticles , Colorimetric immunoassay , Acetylcholinesterase , Magnetic beads , Signal ampliﬁcation 1 Introduction ELISA has received intense attention owing to its advantages such as high throughput detection and no requirement of sophisticated instruments . However , both the detection sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the commonly used clinical ELISAs are unable to fulﬁll the requirements for early diagnosis and monitoring of fatal diseases [ 1 , 2 ] . For example , ELISA is the gold standard for cancer bio - marker detection , whose detection limit is about 0 . 1 ng / mL . This value is generally higher than the concentrations of cancer bio - marker in most serum samples especially at their early stages or after radical prostatectomy . Therefore , ELISA usually allows detec - tion only after biomarker levels have already reached critical thresh - old concentrations , at which point the disease has already advanced markedly . Therefore , improvement of detection sensitivity as well as speciﬁcity is the key of cancer diagnostics . Over the past two decades , AuNP - based assays have drawn considerable research Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 18 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 307 interests owing to their distinct physical and optical properties [ 3 ] . For example , solutions containing mono - dispersed AuNPs display a ruby red color , while the presence of analytes can induce the formation of AuNP aggregates , thus leading to a red - to - blue color change [ 4 ] . The color change upon aggregation of AuNPs has been increasingly utilized for colorimetric sensing of biomar - kers [ 5 , 6 ] . Particularly , the extremely high extinction coefﬁcients of AuNPs make them a perfect alternative to organic molecules ( e . g . , 3 , 3 0 , 5 , 5 0 - tetramethylbenzidine , TMB ) , which generally serve as the substrate for the labeled enzymes in conventional ELISAs [ 7 ] . We therefore designed such an immunoassay by employing AuNPs to generate detection signals . In our study , the AChE - induced aggregation of AuNPs and magnetic beads were integrated into the immunoassays to induce high signal ampliﬁcation ( Fig . 1 ) . To do this , detection antibodies are conjugated with AChE , which catalyzes its substrate acetylthio - choline ( ATC , an analog of acetylcholine ) to generate thiocholine . Thiocholine can be adsorbed on the Au surface via Au - S bond and Fig . 1 The design of acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) - catalyzed hydrolysis reaction for the colorimetric detection of EV71 . ( a ) AChE catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to generate acetate and choline . ( b ) Scheme of the improved sandwich ELISA format . EV71 is pulled down onto the polystyrene ( PS ) substrate by capture antibody ( Ab1 ) and recognized by detection antibody ( Ab2 ) which is conjugated with AChE on magnetic bead ( MB ) . In the presence of acetylthiocholine ( ATC ) and citrate - covered AuNPs , AChE catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATC to generate thiocholine , thus inducing the aggregation of AuNPs via electrostatic interaction 308 Dingbin Liu and Xiaoyuan Chen cause aggregation of the citrate - capped AuNPs owing to the elec - trostatic interactions [ 8 ] . This aggregation event can be trans - formed into color change of the AuNP solution from red to purple . In addition , magnetic beads can load a large number of AChE . After the normal immunoassay operation , very small amount of analyte can thus be detected most likely due to the high density of AChE on magnetic beads where the AChE activity is still preserved . To evaluate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the plasmonic immunoassay , EV71 in clinically relevant samples was employed as a model and compared with polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . This plasmonic immunoassay was further simpliﬁed and employed to detect Treponema pallidum antibodies [ 9 ] . 2 Materials Prepare all solutions using deionized water ( Milli - Q grade , Milli - pore ) with a resistivity of 18 . 2 M Ω - cm ( at 25 (cid:2) C ) .

Place 100 μ L of NHS - activated MBs ( 10 mg / mL ) into a 1 . 5 mL microcentrifuge tube and remove the supernatant with a magnetic stand ( see Note 10 ) . Fig . 2 UV – vis absorption spectra of puriﬁed EV71 detection antibody ( Ab2 , blue line ) and that labeled with DBCO moieties ( DBCO - Ab2 , green line ) . The absorption band at 309 nm indicates the DBCO moieties on Ab2 Acetylcholinesterase - Based Plasmonic Immunoassay 311 2 . Activate the puriﬁed NHS - activated MBs by adding ice - cold HCl solution ( 1 mM ) to wash the beads . 3 . Mix the activated beads with 100 μ L of AChE ( 1 . 0 mg / mL ) in PBS using a vortex for 30 s . Incubate the mixture for 2 h at room temperature on a rotator . During the ﬁrst 30 min of the incuba - tion , mix the solution using a vortex for 15 s every 5 min . For the remaining time , mix the solution using a vortex for 15 s every 15 min until the reaction was complete ( see Note 11 ) . 4 . Once obtain the AChE - loaded MBs , measure the activity of the anchored AChE by using AChE assay kit . By means of the equation , AChE activity ¼ OD 10min (cid:4) OD 2min OD Cal (cid:4) OD H 2 O (cid:3) n (cid:3) 200 U = L ð Þ ð 2 Þ where OD 10min and OD 2min are the OD 412 values of the sam - ples at 10 min and 2 min , respectively ; OD Cal and OD H2O are the values of the calibrator and water at 10 min ; n is the dilution factor , the activity of the anchored AChE was calculated to be 15 . 7 U / mL . Since covalent conjugation may cause some loss of enzyme activity , it is therefore necessary to calculate the remaining AChE activity after loading onto MBs . The theoret - ical AChE activity on MB was calculated to be 17 . 6 U / mL by subtracting the excess AChE from the added AChE . Therefore , 89 . 1 % ( 15 . 7 / 17 . 6 (cid:3) 100 % ) of the original AChE activity ( 1256 U / mg protein ) was maintained after the conjugation and its activity was decreased to be 1119 U / mg protein . Based on this ﬁnding , the amount of the loaded AChE was calculated to be 14 . 03 μ g / mL ( ¼ 3 . 1 (cid:3) 10 13 AChE / mL ) . Since the con - centration of MBs was roughly 10 9 particles / mL , we estimate the number of AChE per MB to be 31 , 000 . Fig . 3 Procedure of preparing Ab2 - AChE - MB . AChE molecules are coated onto MB through NHS chemistry . The AChE - MB further reacts with NHS - azide , and then conjugates with DBCO - Ab2 via copper - free click chemistry to form Ab2 - AChE - MB 312 Dingbin Liu and Xiaoyuan Chen 5 . Add 10 μ L of mPEG - NH 2 ( MW ¼ 2000 , 100 mM ) into 1 mL of the obtained AChE - MBs ( 1 mg / mL ) to block the unreacted NHS ester . Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 2 h and purify the products with a magnetic stand . 6 . In order to conjugate with DBCO - Ab2 , modify the AChE - MBs with azide groups by adding 5 μ L of NHS - activated azide ( 1 mM ) into the obtained AChE - MB solution . Incubate the resulting solution at room temperature for 30 min and purify the products with a magnetic stand . 7 . Mix the resulting azide - modiﬁed AChE - MBs ( 1 mL , 1 mg / mL ) with the as - prepared DBCO - Ab2 ( 10 μ L , 1 mg / mL ) and incubate the resulting mixture at room temperature for 2 h . Collect the resulting Ab2 - AChE - MBs puriy the product with a magnetic stand for further use . 3 . 3 Identiﬁcation of AuNP - Based Probe 1 . Optimize the pH value of the citrate - AuNPs ( 15 nm , 2 . 3 nM ) to be around 8 . 0 by adding K 2 CO 3 solution ( 1 mM ) where AChE may hold maximal activity when reacting with its sub - strate [ 11 ] ( see Note 12 ) . 2 . Add different concentrations of Ab2 - AChE - MBs into the solu - tions composed of 100 μ L of the as - prepared citrate - AuNPs ( 2 . 3 nM ) and ATC ( 20 μ M ) . The ﬁnal concentrations of the beads are in the range from 1 . 0 to 20 (cid:3) 10 3 particles / mL . Incubate the mixtures at room temperature for 10 min ( see Note 13 ) . 3 . Collect the absorbance of the samples at 520 and 700 nm by a Synergy 2 Multi - Mode Microplate Reader every 1 min during the hydrolysis of ATC . 4 . Figure 4 shows the plots of A 700 / A 520 ( the ratio of absorbance at 700 and 520 nm ) values versus the incubation time ( 0 – 10 min ) for various concentrations of Ab2 - AChE - MB . Within the incubation time , the A 700 / A 520 values increased except for the blank sample , whose A 700 / A 520 values had negligible changes . 3 . 4 AuNP - Based Colorimetric Immunoassay for EV71 Detection Conduct the immunoassay detection in the commonly used 96 - well polystyrene ( PS ) plates . 1 . Add the anti - EV71 capture antibodies ( Ab1 , 4 μ g / mL ) into the wells of the PS plate and incubate at 4 (cid:2) C overnight . 2 . After rinsing with PBS for three runs , add 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) into each well as blocking agent to minimize the nonspeciﬁc binding when conducting the immunoassay detection . 3 . Add EV71 - spiked PBS and HTS solutions respectively at con - centrations ranging from 10 4 to 10 8 copies / mL , and Set the Acetylcholinesterase - Based Plasmonic Immunoassay 313 PBS - only and HTS - only solutions as the blank . Keep the plate at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h and wash the wells with PBS for three runs . 4 . Add 100 μ L of Ab2 - AChE - MB ( 0 . 1 mg / mL ) solutions into each well , and incubate for 20 min . Add 200 μ L of PBST into each well and rinse for three runs ( see Note 14 ) . 5 . Add 100 μ L of the mixture composed of ATC ( 20 μ M ) and citrate - AuNPs ( 15 nm , 2 . 3 nM ) at pH ¼ 8 . 0 into each well . Collect the absorbance at 520 and 700 nm by a Synergy 2 Multi - Mode Microplate Reader . 6 . Calculate the A 700 / A 520 values for each sample , and compare the values among various concentrations of EV71 ( see Note 15 ) . 4 Notes 1 . Dilute 100 mL of 10 (cid:3) concentrated PBS to 990 mL with deionized water and add 10 mL of 5 % Tween - 20 . Care should be taken to add Tween - 20 solution , since it makes bubbles . PBST was used mainly as the diluent . 2 . Dilute 1 mL of concentrated HCl ( 37 % , 12 M ) to 12 mL with ice - cold water . 1 mL of the resulted HCl ( 1 M ) was further diluted to 1 L by adding 999 mL ice - cold water . Finally , 1 mM of diluted HCl was achieved with pH 3 . 3 . To maintain the enzyme activity of AChE , it should be prepared with deionized water in a relatively high concentra - tion ( 100 mg / mL ) , and store at (cid:4) 20 (cid:2) C . When used , the Fig . 4 Plots of A 700 / A 520 values of citrate - AuNP solutions incubated with ATC ( 20 μ M ) and different concentrations ( 1 . 0 – 20 (cid:3) 10 3 particles / mL ) of Ab2 - AChE - MB versus incubation time ( 0 – 10 min ) . Collect the absorbance at 520 and 700 nm simultaneously every 1 min by a Synergy 2 Multi - Mode Microplate Reader . Set the citrate - AuNP solution incubated with ATC ( 20 μ M ) alone as the blank 314 Dingbin Liu and Xiaoyuan Chen concentrated AChE can be diluted to the desired concentra - tions with PBS . 4 . Since the NHS ester tend to degrade in the presence of water , dry DMSO was used to dissolve the NHS ester powder to a relatively high concentration ( 100 mM ) , so as to minimize the possible degradation . When used to react with amine deriva - tives , the concentrated NHS ester can be diluted to the desired concentrations with dry DMSO . 5 . The working reagent was freshly prepared before the measure - ments . Ab2 - AChE - MBs solutions were diluted to desired folds by using assay buffer . 10 μ L of each solution was added into separate wells in a 96 - well polystyrene plate , followed by add - ing 190 μ L of working reagent into the wells and mixed thor - oughly . Meanwhile , 200 μ L of calibrator and 200 μ L of H 2 O were added into separate wells , respectively . The plate was placed in a plate reader to collect the optical density ( OD ) values at 412 nm at 2 and 10 min . 6 . The commerically avalaible citrate - stabilized AuNPs are sensi - tive to enviromental conditions such as high salts and high / low temperature , under which the native AuNPs tend to aggregate . It should be avoided to contaminate the native AuNPs with PBS owing to its high ionic strength . Also note that the native AuNPs should be stored at 4 (cid:2) C . 7 . In aqueous solutions , ATC could be hydrolyzed into thiocho - line and acetic acid . To minimize the nonspeciﬁc hydrolysis , ATC should be concentrated to a high concentration ( 1 M ) and stored at 4 (cid:2) C . Dilute the concentrated ATC solution to the desired concentrations when conducting the detection . 8 . Cultured EV71 isolates ( ~ 10 11 copies / mL ) were diluted with Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM , GIBCO ) to the desired concentrations . Care should be taken to handle the samples , since it possesses possible biosafety issues . 9 . The clinical samples were prepared in DMEM and stored at (cid:4) 80 (cid:2) C for further use . The handling of these samples followed all necessary safety precautions in BSL - 2 laboratories . 10 . To keep dispersity of the beads in the process of transport and storage , they are commonly stabilized by supernatants . The supernatants should be removed by a magnetic stand before activating the beads . 11 . Owing to their big size , the magnetic beads tend to precipitate in the process of modiﬁcation , thus the reaction should be conducted on a rotator . Importantly , the tube should be mixed using a vortex frequently in the whole process . 12 . The original pH value of citrate - stabilized AuNPs solution is usually 4 ~ 5 because of the presence of citric acid . However , the Acetylcholinesterase - Based Plasmonic Immunoassay 315 maximal activity of AChE is usually at pH 8 . So it is necessary to adjust the pH value of the solution to around 8 by adding K 2 CO 3 whose ﬁnal concentration is 1 mM . 13 . Long time of incubation of ATC in aqueous solutions may lead to degradation of ATC even in the absence of AChE , thereby it is necessary to set the citrate - AuNP solution incubated with ATC ( 20 μ M ) alone as the blank . 14 . Rinsing the wells with 200 μ L of PBST three times will help remove a bulk of the nonspeciﬁc adsorption of the beads . 15 . By measuring the A 700 / A 520 value for various concentrations of EV71 , we observed that the A 700 / A 520 values for both EV71 - spiked PBS and HTS samples had a similar trend : increasing gradually from around 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 as the amount of EV71 added was increased .

Fernandes and Pedro V . Baptista Abstract Multifunctionalized gold nanobeacons ( Au - nanobeacon ) combine , in a single and unique platform , targeting , detection and silencing providing an effective impact in clinics boosting cancer theranostics . Here , we describe a nano - integrated platform based on Au - nanobeacons able to detect and inhibit gene expression speciﬁcally in cancer cells . The surfaces of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs ) are functionalized with targeting peptides to enhance tumor cell recognition and uptake , and with ﬂuorescently labeled antisense DNA hairpin oligonucleotides to detect AuNPs . These oligonucleotides , upon recognition and hybridiza - tion to the target , open their structure resulting in separating apart the dye and the quencher allowing the ﬂuorophore to emit light and to monitor the intracellular interactions of AuNPs with the target and the speciﬁc silencing of gene expression . This strategy allows inhibiting KRAS gene expression in colorectal carcinoma cell lines with no relevant toxicity for healthy ﬁbroblasts . Importantly , this nano - integrated platform can be easily adapted to hybridize with any speciﬁc target thus providing real beneﬁts for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer .

As such , one of the main challenges in cancer therapy has been the development of novel integrated systems capable of increasing the therapeutic index , which is only attained by improving the pharmacokinetic parameters of these drugs . Another issue has been the selectivity towards cancer cells and the precision of action . Ideally such sys - tems ought to have increased circulating times in the blood stream without being detected and cleared by the immune system resulting Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 19 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 319 in failed delivery to tumor cells , and should be able to simulta - neously address disease diagnostics and treatment—theranostics . Nanotechnology has been addressing this challenge by offering a plethora of novel multifunctional nanodevices capable of bypassing biological barriers , speciﬁcally recognizing a desirable target and signaling it for effective gene silencing in cancer cells , thus reducing systemic toxicity and severe adverse side effects in healthy tissues [ 1 – 5 ] . AuNPs are prime nontoxic carriers for gene therapy due to their ﬁne chemical properties and ease of surface modiﬁcation with a multiplicity of ligands ( e . g . , targeting moieties , silencing moieties , or therapeutic loads ) [ 6 – 10 ] . Nanotechnology and AuNPs in par - ticular have put forward several unconventional strategies largely spinning around the concept of precision medicine to improve the limited therapeutic outcomes for several types of cancers [ 1 ] . Oligonucleotide - based therapeutics have been under clinical development since the early 90s and antisense DNA constitutes a powerful tool for speciﬁc posttranscriptional gene silencing [ 11 – 13 ] . The development of nanocarriers for antisense - oligonucleotide targeted delivery could have a positive contribu - tion in cancer therapy minimizing toxicity and side effects [ 13 ] . In fact , we have previously demonstrated that AuNPs functionalized with a ﬂuorophore - labeled hairpin - DNA ( Au - nanobeacon ) may be used as a theranostics approach in antisense DNA / RNA interfer - ence ( RNAi ) [ 6 , 10 , 14 ] . The ease of translation of this concept to any cellular target ( s ) of interest with the ability to monitor in real time their therapeutic effects in cancer cells will , thus , be of utter - most importance in the development of successful anti - cancer stra - tegies [ 6 , 10 , 13 , 14 ] . Ras monomeric GTPases are transduction molecules that reg - ulate cell proliferation , survival , and differentiation [ 15 ] . KRAS is one of the most commonly activated oncogenes in human cancer , with 17 – 25 % of all human tumors harboring an activating Kras mutation [ 16 ] . Thus , the relevance of the KRAS oncogene in cancer maintenance and progression is well recognized together with its role in increasing resistance to conventional chemothera - pies [ 17 ] . In this respect the search for KRAS - targeting therapies has long been high on the agenda of cancer therapeutics [ 17 – 19 ] . The protocol described here details the synthesis and characteri - zation of a multifunctional Au - nanobeacon to detect and inhibit KRAS gene for a theranostic approach in colorectal carcinoma cells . The in vitro proof - of - concept may become a valuable tool in the lab to assist molecular studies and screening of cell targets , and might in the short term be extended to the clinics . The hairpin conﬁguration and the proximity of the ﬂuorophore to the AuNPs’ surface quenches ﬂuorescence emission , whereas recognition and hybridization to the KRAS mRNA restores ﬂuorescence emission due to the opening of the hairpin allowing tracking the silencing in real time . The Au - nanobeacons may also be functionalized with targeting moieties ( e . g . , RGD peptide ) for tumor speciﬁc targeting ( Fig . 1 ) . 320 Alexandra R . Fernandes and Pedro V .

Algorithms and tools to design sequences such as that from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research ( http : / / sirna . wi . mit . edu / ) or the Broad Institute ( http : / / www . broadinstitute . org / rnai / public / seq / search ) are an example . In order to analyze the speciﬁcity for the desirable target , avoiding cross homology , BLAST analysis should be performed ( http : / / blast . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / Blast . cgi ) . Secondary structures caused by self - complementary in the oligonucleotide sequence should be avoided and for that OligoCalc ( http : / / www . basic . northwestern . edu / bio tools / oligocalc . html ) and NUPACK nucleic acid package ( http : / / www . nupack . org / ) may be used . See Table 1 for the sequences obtained . 3 . 2 Synthesis of Citrate Gold Nanoparticles AuNPs are synthesized by the citrate reduction method described by Lee and Meisel [ 21 ] . Brieﬂy : 1 . Prepare aqua regia by mixing 3 : 1 concentrated HCl – HNO 3 in a large and open container in a fume hood ( see Note 5 ) . 2 .

Calculate the AuNPs concentration via Lambert – Beer equation using the absorbance and the molar absorptivity of the AuNPs ( typical Surface Plasmon Resonance peak at 520 nm ( see Note 8 ) . 10 . The AuNPs are stable for several months at RT ( stored in a glass container previously treated with aqua regia ) ( see Note 9 ) . 3 . 3 Synthesis of PEGylated - Gold Nanoparticles Functionalization of citrate AuNPs ( at 25 % saturated surface ) is carried out using equal amounts of two bifunctional spacers ( PEG ) with a thiol end to bond covalently to the AuNP . The other functional group at the other end is either an azide group ( SH - ( CH 2 ) 3 - CONH - EG ( 6 ) - ( CH 2 ) 2 - N 3 ( PEG - N 3 ) ) or a carboxylic groups ( SH - EG ( 8 ) - ( CH 2 ) 2 - COOH ( PEG - COOH ) ) for the other spacer . These end groups can act as substrates for 1 - Ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - carbodiimide ( EDC ) / N - Hydroxysuc - cinimide ( NHS ) coupling reactions ( see Note 10 ) . 1 . Mix 41 . 7 mL of a 12 nM stock solution of citrate AuNPs ( ﬁnal concentration , 10 nM ) with 150 μ L of a 1 mg / mL stock solution of PEG - N 3 ( ﬁnal concentration , 7 μ M ) and 150 μ L of a 1 mg / mL stock solution of PEG - COOH ( ﬁnal concentra - tion , 7 μ M ) in an aqueous solution of SDS ( 0 . 028 % ) .

Centrifuge the mixture to remove the excess of PEG that did not bind to citrate AuNPs ( 14 , 000 (cid:3) g for 30 min at 4 (cid:1) C ) ( see Note 11 ) . 326 Alexandra R . Fernandes and Pedro V . Baptista 4 . Remove the supernatant ( see Note 12 ) and resuspend the precipitate in DEPC - treated water . 5 .

Functionalization can be performed with other peptides of interest ( e . g . , TAT peptide [ 22 ] ) . 1 . For a 200 μ L reaction : Incubate 20 nM of PEGylated AuNPs and RGD ( ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 5 mM ) with 6 mM sulfo - N - hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt and EDC in 25 mM MES buffer pH 6 . 1 for 16 h at RT . 2 . Centrifuge the mixture ( 14 , 000 (cid:3) g for 30 min at 4 (cid:1) C ) to remove the excess of unbound RGD peptide . 3 . The supernatants are recovered and tested for protein concen - tration using the BCA Protein Assay Kit following the manu - facturer speciﬁcations . 4 . To determine the RGD coverage on PEGylated AuNPs @ RGD subtract the amount of RGD in the supernatant to the amount of RGD added in step 1 . 3 . 5 Synthesis of Gold Nanobeacons Two different sequences of nanobeacons were prepared : a nano - beacon anti - KRAS ( detects and inhibits KRAS mRNA ) and a nanobeacon nonsense ( designed to not hybridize with any target within the genome ) ( Table 1 for thiol - DNA - hairpin Cy3 sequences ) . Brieﬂy : 1 . Mix the thiolated oligonucleotides with DTT to attain a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 1 M . Incubate for at least 2 h at 4 (cid:1) C . 2 . Extract one volume ( 100 – 500 μ L ) of thiolated oligonucleotide with two volumes of ethyl acetate . Mix thoroughly . Multifunctionalized Gold Nanoparticles for KRAS Gene Silencing 327 3 .

Purify the mixture through a desalting NAP - 5 column ( eluent—10 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 8 ) ) . 6 . Quantify the puriﬁed oligonucleotide by UV – visible spectros - copy ( see Note 14 ) . 7 . Mix the determined volume of the puriﬁed oligonucleotides with 10 nM of PEGylated AuNPs @ RGD ( prepared in Subheading 3 . 4 ) to result in a 1 : 100 PEGylated AuNPs @ RGD – oligonucleotide ratio . 8 . Add AGE I solution to the mixture to achieve a ﬁnal concen - tration of 10 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 8 ) and 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) SDS . 9 . Sonicate the AuNPs mixture for 10 s ( in an ultrasound bath ) and incubated for 20 min at RT . 10 . Add a speciﬁc volume of AGE II solution ( ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 8 ) , 0 . 3 M NaCl , 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) SDS ) to the AuNPs mixture in order to increase the ionic strength of the solution sequentially ( 50 mM NaCl increments ) . After each increment , the AuNPs mixture is sonicated ( 10 s ) and incubated at RT for 20 min before the next increment . 11 . Leave the solution to rest for 16 h at RT . 12 . Centrifuge the Au - nanobeacons ( 20 min , 21 , 000 RCF ) . There should be an oily precipitate at the bottom of the microfuge tube . Remove a ﬁxed amount of supernatant and store it . Redisperse the precipitate in the same volume of DEPC - treated water ( see Note 15 ) . 13 . Repeat step 12 two more times . 14 . Prepare a calibration curve ( designated as calibration curve A within the range : 0 . 1 – 10 μ mol of oligonucleotide ) by mixing an appropriate amount of ﬂuorescent oligonucleotide with AGE I and AGE II solutions to obtain a ﬁnal volume of 100 μ L ( ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 8 ) , 0 . 3 M NaCl and 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) SDS ) . 15 .

Baptista present in each supernatant ( use calibration curve A for the supernatant recovered in step 12 and calibration curve B for the supernatants recovered in step 13 ) . 18 . Calculate the amount of oligonucleotides present at the surface of the Au - nanobeacon ( subtract the results from step 17 from the amount of oligonucleotides added in step 7 . 19 . Characterize the Au - nanobeacons by determining the hydro - dynamic radius using Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS ) and the surface charge through Zeta Potential [ 6 ] . 20 . Store the Au - nanobeacons at 4 (cid:1) C in the dark ( no loss of ﬂuorescence signal or signs of aggregation at least for 3 months ) . 3 . 6 Speciﬁcity Assays for Gold Nanobeacons 1 . For the detection of speciﬁc target add 5 nM of complementary KRAS target ( Sigma ) to 2 . 5 nM of nanobeacon anti - KRAS and to 2 . 5 nM of nanobeacon nonsense ( negative control ) in 10 mM of phosphate buffer pH 7 . 2 .

Incubate samples for 10 min at RT and centrifuge ( 25 , 000 (cid:3) g for 10 min at 4 (cid:1) C ) . 12 . Wash the pellet with 75 % ethanol ( add 1 mL of ethanol per 1 mL of TRIsure ® used ) . Vortex samples and centrifuge ( 9000 (cid:3) g for 5 min at 4 (cid:1) C ) . 13 .

HCT116 cells and ﬁbroblasts primary cultures are seeded at a concentration of 1 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / well in 24 - well plates on glass slides in 500 mL of DMEM with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 (cid:1) C 5 % CO 2 . 2 . Following exposure to different Au - nanobeacons for 0 , 24 , 48 and 72 h , HCT116 cell line and Fibroblasts cultures prepara - tions are washed with 1 (cid:3) PBS and readily ﬁxed with 4 % ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde in 1 (cid:3) PBS1 for 15 min at RT . 3 . After three washing steps with 1 (cid:3) PBS , glass slide preparations are mounted in ProLong ® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI to allow for nuclear staining . 4 . Immunoﬂuorescent images of HCT116 cell line and Fibro - blasts primary cell culture are acquired using a confocal ﬂuo - rescence microscope and a digital camera . 5 . Cell count and ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcation is performed for all the conditions ( see Note 16 ) . 6 . Cell number count and ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcation data is assessed through ImageJ software . 3 . 12 Examination of Selective Targeting Using Flow Cytometry Fluorescence may also be assessed by Flow cytometry . Brieﬂy , 1 . Seed HCT - 116 cells and ﬁbroblasts primary culture separately on 35 mm plates at a concentration of 1 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / well in 2000 μ L of DMEM with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum and culture at 37 (cid:1) C 5 % CO 2 . 2 .

Cell samples were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry on an Attune ® Acoustic Focusing Flow Cytometer ( Life Technologies , Carls - bad , California ) , through the acquisition of at least 10 , 000 events for each experimental condition . 4 Notes 1 . ! CAUTION . Wear mask when you are handling it . SDS is a respiratory tract irritant . 2 . ! CAUTION Wear gloves and mask when you are handling it . NaOH can cause chemical burns and may induce permanent blindness if it contacts eyes . Dissolution of NaOH is highly exothermic , which can cause breakage of glass containers and the resulting heat may cause heat burns or ignite ﬂammables . Prepare this solution with extreme care in plastic beakers . Multifunctionalized Gold Nanoparticles for KRAS Gene Silencing 333 3 . ! CAUTION . Be careful when handling DEPC ; it is combusti - ble , unstable—readily decomposes , incompatible with strong oxidizing agents , strong acids , strong reducing agents , strong bases , ammonia . DEPC will react with primary amines and cannot be used directly to treat Tris buffers . DEPC is highly unstable in the presence of Tris buffers and decomposes rapidly into ethanol and CO 2 . Residual DEPC must always be elimi - nated from solutions or vessels by autoclaving or heating to 100 (cid:1) C for 15 min . 4 . ! CAUTION . DTT is an eye irritant . 5 . ! CAUTION . Be extremely careful when preparing and work - ing with aqua regia . Wear goggles and gloves at all times , and perform all the experiment in a fume hood . Aqua regia should be freshly prepared and should never be stored in a closed vessel . Closed aqua regia containers may explode . Safe disposal should be performed by careful dilution and neutralization . 6 . The initial pale yellow color of the Au ( III ) solution should become immediately colorless and then progressively change to deep red ( Au ( III ) ions are reduced to Au ( I ) and when the solution becomes saturated of Au ( I ) atoms , they start to pre - cipitate in the form of AuNPs ) . The citrate acts as capping and stabilizing agent covering the AuNPs’ surface avoiding its aggregation [ 25 ] . 7 . The AuNPs produced should be red , have an average diameter of 14 . 0 nm ( between 13 and 15 nm ) and spherical under TEM [ 6 ] . 8 . Do not exceed an absorbance of 2 ( avoid deviations to the Lambert – Beer law ) . Sample dilution should be considered when the measured absorbance exceeds 2 . Take this dilution into consideration when calculating the original stock concentration . 9 . Do not freeze the nanoparticles . 10 . Since only 25 % of the AuNP is saturated with the PEG layer , the incorporation of additional thiolated components ( e . g . , a desired thiolated DNA - hairpin - Cy3 ) is possible . 11 . A clear supernatant and an oily red precipitate should be observed after centrifugation . 12 . Preserve the supernatant for subsequent analysis . 13 . To determine the amount of PEG molecules bonded to the AuNPs’ surface use the calibration curve to calculate the amount of PEG in the supernatant and subtract this value from the amount added to the AuNPs solution . 14 . Use the extinction coefﬁcient at 260 nm provided by the oligonucleotide manufacturer or calculate it through one of 334 Alexandra R . Fernandes and Pedro V . Baptista the many available online tools ( e . g . , http : / / www . basic . north western . edu / biotools / oligocalc . html ) ) for quantiﬁcation . 15 . Be careful and do not disturb the precipitate while removing the supernatant . This can result in major losses of Au - nano - beacons and contamination of the supernatant with Au - nanobeacons . 16 . Use a quartz cuvette for measuring ﬂuorescence and the appro - priate excitation , detection wavelengths and their respective slits ( i . e . , for Cy3 excite the ﬂuorophore at 550 nm , collect the emission at 570 nm and use 5 nm slits ) . 17 . Hybridization of the DNA hairpin to a complementary target ( i . e . , Kras mRNA ) restores ﬂuorescence emission due to the Au - nanobeacons’ conformational reorganization ( the ﬂuoro - phore and the quencher to part from each other ) , yielding a quantitative response ( increase ﬂuorescence with time ) . The nonsense nanobeacon does not hybridize with any target and will not produce a quantitative response and no ﬂuorescence increase with time will be observed . 18 . Carry out a titration series of the various concentrations of ﬂuorescent oligonucleotide functionalized on the AuNPs’ sur - face to identify the most effective sequence and the lowest possible concentration that still generates the desired level of knockdown . 19 . The sample will separate into three phases : ( 1 ) a pale green phenol – chloroform phase , ( 2 ) an interphase , and ( 3 ) a color - less upper aqueous phase ( contains the RNA ) . 20 . All cell lysates will be further used to quantify the total protein using the BCA assay . 21 . The total protein concentration of each sample may also be measured using the Bradford assay [ 26 ] . 22 . Samples can be stored at 4 (cid:1) C for up to 2 h .

Baptista Chapter 20 Generation of Dose – Response Curves and Improved IC50s for PARP Inhibitor Nanoformulations Paige Baldwin , Shifalika Tangutoori , and Srinivas Sridhar Abstract Poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitors that target DNA damage repair pathways in cancer cells are increasingly attractive for treating several cancers . Determining the half maximal inhibitory concentra - tion ( IC50 ) of these molecular inhibitors in cell lines is crucial for further dosing for in vivo experiments . Typically these in vitro assays are conducted for 24 – 72 h ; however , PARP inhibitors exhibit cytotoxicity based on the inability to repair DNA damage and thus the accumulation of deleterious mutations takes place over longer times . Therefore , in order to determine a relevant dose response , the time frame of the assay must be modiﬁed to account for the time required for the cells to exhibit effects from the treatment . Here , we describe two techniques for generating both short - and long - term dose – response curves for both free PARP inhibitors and nanoparticle formulations of these drugs . Key words IC50 , PARP inhibitors , Short - term , Long - term , Doubling time 1 Introduction IC50 values , the concentration of an inhibitor required to reduce cellular response by 50 % , are widely published for most drugs and typically used in the planning of more in depth in vitro drug studies . However , these values depend on cell line , drug , time frame , and the type of assay conducted [ 1 , 2 ] . Currently , molecularly targeted therapies are a major area of research in development of persona - lized cancer treatments . Molecular therapeutics differ from stan - dard chemotherapeutics in that they do not simply kill cells , but interact with a speciﬁc target leading to a downstream effect [ 3 ] . Thus , in order to determine the applicability of these drugs , they must be tested in large panels of cell lines with different genomic proﬁles to elicit sensitivity and potential resistance mechanisms [ 4 ] . Poly ( ADP - ribose ) Polymerase ( PARP ) plays an important role in a number of DNA repair pathways , and has thus become a prime target of inhibition [ 5 ] . PARP inhibitorsPoly ( ADP - ribose ) Poly - merase nhibitors ( PARPi ) exploit the concept of synthetic lethality Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 20 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 337 by selectively targeting cancer cells with defective DNA repair path - ways , promoting the accumulation of single - and double - strand breaks eventually leading to cell death [ 6 , 7 ] . The typical 24 – 72 h viability assessments are therefore , not relevant for determining the IC50 values of such drugs in which the cytotoxicity is a downstream effect of the drug target . By increasing the length of the assay the cells will replicate multiple times and those which are sensitive to the drug treatment will accumulate genotoxicity eventually halting proliferation and leading to cell death . The effect here is similar to studying radiation effects where the clonogenic assay is used to determine efﬁcacy of radiation treatment in vitro [ 8 ] . Lipid based nanoformulations of the PARP inhibitors Olaparib and Talazoparib have been developed by us with the goal of enhancing the bioavailability of the drugs , thereby increasing the tumor accumulation and efﬁcacy in vivo . Dose response and IC50 values are crucial for ensuring that the nanoformulations offer the same potency in vitro as the free drugs . Here we detail a short - term high throughput manner of determining IC50s for cell line sensi - tivity , and a long - term method to provide an accurate dose response for comparison of free drug and nanoformulations . The short - term assay involves determining the population dou - bling time , and seeding an appropriate amount of cells to ensure that cells could be treated for four doubling cycles without cell death occurring because of over conﬂuence and lack of nutrients . The long - term assay is a 14 - day colony formation assay in which cells are treated with nanoparticles or free drug twice weekly to maintain drug exposure over the length of the assay [ 9 ] . The nanoparticles are PEGylated ( i . e . , functionalized with polyethylene glycol or PEG ) , which allows them to evade recognition by the immune system and therefore reduce clearance by the reticuloen - dothelial system and enhance the circulation time in vivo [ 10 ] . PEGylated particles also may not be taken up by the cells as quickly as that of the free drugs , therefore the 14 - day assay provides enough time to ensure the particles are being taken up and that the drug has enough time to generate DNA damage and cell death . 2 Materials 1 .

Seed the inner wells of ﬁve 96 - well plates with 500 , 1000 , 2000 , 4000 , and 8000 cells per well . You will have two rows per cell density . Plate 1 should have 100 μ L of media per well , while plates 2 – 5 should have 200 μ L of media per well ( see Note 1 ) . 2 . Allow plate 1 to equilibrate for 1 h before measuring cell viability using cell metabolism . Using Promega Cell Titer 96 AQueous One Solution , brieﬂy add 20 μ L of reagent to each well and incubate plate for 1 – 4 h at 37 (cid:1) C and 5 % CO 2 . Measure the absorbance at 490 nm in a microplate reader ( see Notes 2 and 3 ) . 3 . Measure cell viability at 24 , 48 , 72 , and 96 h after the original seeding time . Brieﬂy , mix 20 μ L of reagent with 100 μ L of media for each well , and incubate for the same length of time as in step 3 before measuring absorbance at 490 nm ( see Note 4 ) . 4 . Utilize the reading from plate 1 to generate a standard curve correlating absorbance to number of cells . Use this curve to extrapolate the number of cells at each density for each time point . 5 . Plot cell density against time for each starting density and ﬁt each curve using exponential regression . The population dou - bling time can be calculated by t d ¼ ln ( 2 ) / μ net , where μ net can be calculated from Y ¼ ae ( μ net (cid:3) t ) where t d is the population doubling time , μ net is net speciﬁc growth rate , a is the initial cell concentration , t is time in hours , and Y is the cell concentration at time t . 3 . 2 Short - Term IC50 Generation 1 . Seed the inner wells of two 96 - well plates at the appropriate seeding density as determined from the doubling time calcula - tion ( see Note 5 ) . 2 . The following day remove all media , and treat cells with a range of doses of free drug and nanoparticles . Concentrations will vary based on the drug potency ; for the PARP inhibitor Ola - parib , cells were treated with 0 – 100 μ M free Olaparib or NanoOlaparib ( see Note 6 ) . Improved IC50 Generation for Inhibitors 339 3 . Allow cells to incubate with the drug treatments for four doubling cycles . 4 . Measure cell viability by mixing 20 μ L of reagent with 100 μ L of media for each well . Prepare enough of this solution to add it to all treated wells as well as six empty wells , which will serve as blanks ( see Note 7 ) . 5 . Incubate both plates for 1 – 4 h at 37 (cid:1) C and 5 % CO 2 . Measure the absorbance at 490 nm in a microplate reader . 6 . Determine percent cell viability at each concentration . Plot percent viability versus log [ concentration ] and ﬁt using a four parameter logistic regression . Software such as GraphPad Prism can be used , and will provide the IC50 value in the results tab . 3 . 3 Long - Term IC50 Generation 1 . Seed three 6 - well plates in duplicate with cell densities ranging from 50 to 2000 cells per well . Three plates will be used for free drug and three for testing nanoparticles . The ﬁrst two sets of wells will be controls , and the remaining seven will have increasing drug concentrations . The number of cells seeded will increase as the drug concentration increases ( see Note 8 ) . 2 . Remove media and wash each well with PBS after cells have attached , 4 – 6 h post seeding . 3 . Treat each well with either Olaparib or NanoOlaparib in increasing concentrations . 4 . Replace the media in each well twice a week for 2 weeks ( see Note 9 ) . 5 . On day 14 wash with PBS and add formalin to ﬁx the cells . Add crystal violet stain directly to the formalin , and allow to sit for 30 min . 6 . Wash each plate three times with water to remove any excess crystal violet , and allow plates to dry overnight . 7 . Count all colonies that contain more than 50 cells ( see Note 10 ) . 8 . Using the cell counts for the two control wells , determine the plating efﬁciency ( PE ) . PE ¼ ( number of colonies counted ) / ( number of cells seeded ) Percent cell viability ( PCV ) should be calculated as follows : PCV ¼ ( number of colonies counted / number of cells seeded ) (cid:3) PE . 9 . Plot data and ﬁt curve in the same manner as step 6 of Sub - heading 3 . 2 to determine the IC50 . 4 Notes 1 . Use only the inner 60 wells to ensure no evaporation of media from the outer wells . 340 Paige Baldwin et al . 2 . There are a number of commercial assays available for measur - ing cell viability . These assays can be used to measure viability according to the protocol provided . 3 . For the CellTiter 96 ® AQueous One Solution Cell Prolifera - tion Assay the reagent changes color as it interacts with viable cells . The color change is more prominent over time , therefore , it is crucial to note down the time the cells were treated with the reagent and the exact time in which the plate is read in the plate reader . 4 . Length of exposure to the CellTiter reagent is crucial ; there - fore , on each subsequent day incubate plates for the exact length of time as the calibration curve . 5 . Optimal seeding density is a subjective choice . You need to consider the length of four doubling cycles and if the controls will bypass the linear range of the detection assay at that time . Typically choose the lowest seeding density with the fastest doubling time . 6 . Treat cells from lowest to highest drug concentrations to ensure no contamination by higher concentrations . If you are comparing a nanoformulation to the free drug treat them completely separately so as to minimize risk of error . 7 . Blanks are wells with no cells but with the reagent and media mixture . This will provide the baseline reading for no viable cells . Without subtracting out blanks , wells with no viable cells will still show some viability . 8 . The seeding densities for this assay are in a range , which may need to be optimized before the ﬁnal assay is conducted . Con - trol wells usually should have between 50 and 250 cells . The lowest drug concentrations will have similar densities , while the high concentrations can have more cells . If you ﬁnd that at high concentrations you are seeing no colonies you want to increase the seeding density to 100 times the control wells . If you are still seeing no colonies after 14 days then there is 0 % viability . 9 . Prepare fresh nanoparticle / drug dilutions before each media replenishing to ensure treatment with active drug . 10 . Colonies are only counted if they have more than 50 cells . There are a number of computer programs which can count or aid in the counting process , but be sure that each colony is at least 50 cells . Colonies are not to be overlapping , if so they cannot be counted . This must be taken into account for choos - ing seeding density .

Fahmy , and Dongin Kim Abstract Artiﬁcial antigen - presenting cells ( aAPCs ) overcome many of the limitations of biologically based adoptive immunotherapy protocols . While these acellular systems can be designed with a variety of parameters , including material type , diameter , and proliferative signals for T cells , we outline methods to formulate and characterize a comprehensive polymeric microparticle aAPC platform . These aAPCs , which can be repro - ducibly fabricated in large quantities , efﬁciently stimulate antigen - speciﬁc T cell activation and proliferation by both paracrine cytokine signals and engagement of T cell surface proteins . Key words Polymer , Microparticle , aAPC , Immunotherapy , Paracrine delivery , PLGA 1 Introduction Adoptive immunotherapy , in which tumor - speciﬁc T cells are acti - vated and expanded by antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) presenting tumor antigens and co - stimulatory signals , is a promising strategy to ﬁght cancer . However , the process of stimulating T cells using natural APCs , such as patient - derived dendritic cells pulsed with antigen , is costly , time - and resource - intensive , and unpredictable . Therefore , cleverly engineered acellular artiﬁcial antigen - presenting cells ( aAPCs ) hold tremendous promise for cancer immunotherapy . Several types of acellular aAPC platforms presenting ligands like T - cell - activating antibodies and peptide - major histocompatibility - complexes ( pMHC ) have been tested . aAPC systems assayed include novel liposomal and polymeric formulations , and modiﬁca - tion of commercially available iron oxide or latex micro - and nano - particles [ 1 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Successful aAPCs initiate tumor - speciﬁc adaptive immunity by delivering signals to T cells in a physiologically relevant manner . In natural interactions between APCs and T cells , three signals are delivered in the immunological synapse formed by pMHC on APCs and T cell receptors ( TCR ) on T cells . APC signals delivered to T cells are pMHC , costimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86 that ligate Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 21 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 343 T cell surface protein CD28 , and proliferative cytokines secreted in a paracrine fashion ( Fig . 2 ) . Numerous factors must be considered when choosing and opti - mizing aAPCs . Many aAPCs are fabricated from biocompatible , aliphatic polymer poly ( lactic - co - glycolic ) acid ( PLGA ) because of its extensive clinical use , favorable safety proﬁle , and sustained release of encapsulated payloads [ 3 ] . Others have optimized paramagnetic iron - dextran nanoparticles , termed nano - aAPC , surface - presenting pMHC and anti - CD28 antibodies , which are the ﬁrst in class to activate naı¨ve T cells , which have a higher activation threshold than antigen - experienced T cells [ 4 ] . This recent advance is notable because nanoparticles are more suitable for in vivo immunotherapy than microparticles , due to size - mediated favorable trafﬁcking and biodistribution [ 4 ] . Further work into aAPC development has shown that particle geometry is an important design parameter , as ellipsoid PLGA microparticles activated CD8 + T cells to a greater extent , both in vitro and in vivo against melanoma , than spherical microparticles with constant particle volume and antigen [ 5 ] . Addi - tionally , surface properties of aAPC platforms , such as roughness , can enhance immunotherapeutic effects . This effect was elegantly demonstrated by the ﬁnding that aAPCs , a composite of carbon nanotubes and polymer nanoparticles , efﬁciently expanded antigen - speciﬁc T cells using a 1000 - fold less IL - 2 than clinical standards [ 6 ] . Fig . 1 Four types of acellular aAPCs . Research strategies generally include the addition of peptide - MHC complexes and activating antibodies to the surfaces of spherical acellular particles . Adapted from [ 1 ] 344 Alyssa L . Siefert et al . Initial attempts to engineer aAPCs relied on delivering pMHC and costimulation to cells , along with added soluble cytokines to cell culture media , but they faced problems such as acute toxicity and cytokine withdrawal . These limitations motivated Steenblock and colleagues to develop a ﬂexible aAPC platform [ 7 ] that includes the three signals necessary for adaptive immunity in a biodegrad - able microparticle platform ( Fig . 3 ) . We choose to focus on this comprehensive PLGA microparticle platform based on its relative ease and low cost of manufacturing , high potential for clinical translation , and reproducible results . Importantly , the diffusion kinetics between microparticles and cells are characteristic of in vivo interactions [ 8 ] . The properties of PLGA micro - and nano - particles depend on several formulation factors , including fabrication technique , solvent volatility and mis - cibility , polymer molecular weight ( MW ) , encapsulant properties , and drug – polymer ratio [ 9 ] . Techniques to formulate particles include single emulsion ( oil - in - water ) , double emulsion ( water - in - oil - in - water ) , nanoprecipita - tion , and phase separation . Emulsion processes involve ﬁrst dissolving the PLGA polymer in a volatile organic solvent , followed by addition of encapsulant in an aqueous phase to create a solution in which energy , in the form of sonication or stirring , is added to form droplets . The solvent is then removed from the emulsion , which is often stabilized , by extraction or evaporation , and oil Intiation / amplification of the antigen - specific response Cytokines T cell DC Vaccines Target of immune potentiator and delivery system CD40L CD40 TCR MHCCD28 CD80 / 86 Fig . 2 Schematic of natural interaction between T cell and APC , showing the three signals necessary for durable adaptive immunity .

The resulting hardened emulsions are particles that can be washed and lyophilized to create a shelf - stable , dry product [ 9 ] . The components of designed particles , arranged on a polymeric matrix , are ( 1 ) pMHC complexes to confer antigen speciﬁcity to T cells , ( 2 ) costimulatory molecules , including but not limited to antibodies against CD3 and CD28 , to activate T cells , and ( 3 ) soluble cytokines to further differentiate and proliferate antigen - speciﬁc T cells .

In a 50 mL polypropylene tube with a tiny stir bar , prepare a 5 mg / mL solution of avidin by adding 100 mg avidin to 20 mL 2 % sodium deoxycholate . 4 . Dissolve avidin by stirring in a 37 (cid:1) C water bath . 5 . After avidin is dissolved ( brief incubation in a water sonication bath may be necessary ) , add 15 - fold molar excess of NHS - palmitate , 8 mg NHS - palmitate to 100 mg avidin . 6 . Sonicate this solution in a 37 (cid:1) C water bath until no palmitate ﬂakes remain . 7 . Secure the vial in 37 (cid:1) C water bath and allow reaction to continue for 3 h under stirring . 8 . After reaction is complete , dialyze avidin - palmitate solution by transferring to Snakeskin 10 , 000 MWCO dialysis tubing and dialyzing against 2 % sodium deoxycholate at 37 (cid:1) C overnight , stirring in a fume hood . 9 . Use a BCA assay , following manufacturer instructions , to determine the protein content of avidin - palmitate solution . 3 . 2 Fabrication of Microparticles Microparticles can be made using a single or double - emulsion technique , chosen depending on desired size range and type and degree of encapsulants . For instance , single emulsion techniques , also called oil / water ( o / w ) methods , are useful for encapsulating hydrophobic molecules like small molecule drugs and steroids . Because double emulsion , or water / oil / water ( w / o / w ) , formula - tion strategies are best suited for encapsulation of hydrophilic molecules like proteins and peptides [ 1 ] , we outline that procedure below : 1 . Dissolve 100 mg 50 : 50 PLGA in 4 mL chloroform in glass test tube ( Tube 1 ) , creating a solution with a polymer / solvent ratio of 25 mg / mL . 348 Alyssa L . Siefert et al . 2 . Shake on plate shaker for 20 min to ensure homogenous dis - solving in an eppendorf tube . 3 . Prepare 100 μ L of 100 μ g / mL solution of IL - 2 in sterile PBS in an Eppendorf tube . 4 .

While holding Tube 1 containing dissolved polymer on a benchtop vortex , use a Pasteur glass pipet to add 100 μ L IL - 2 solution dropwise to vortexing polymer / solvent solution , maximizing contact area between aqueous protein solution and organic polymer solution . 7 . Continue vortexing for 30 s . 8 . Using a benchtop vortex to mix Tube 2 , containing PVA and avidin - palmitate , use a Pasteur glass pipet to add the contents of Tube 1 to Tube 2 , continuing vortexing . 9 . Add the contents of Tube 2 to the beaker containing 0 . 3 % PVA . 10 . Allow solvent evaporation and polymer hardening to occur for 3 h at room temperature in fume hood . 11 . Collect microparticles by centrifuging solution at 5600 RCF for 5 min . 12 .

Lyophilize for 48 h or until a dry powder is formed ( see Note 2 for further storage instructions ) . 3 . 3 Characterization of Microparticles Microparticles can be sized in several ways depending on equip - ment availability . To collect particles in narrow size ranges , ﬁlters and centrifugation gradients may be used . Particle diameters may be quantiﬁed using free ImageJ software ( NIH ) to analyze images of particles coated in gold or carbon obtained by Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Alternatively , hydrodynamic diameters of particles can be obtained by instruments like ﬂow cytometers [ 14 ] or Beckman Coulter Counters [ 15 ] . To determine IL - 2 - protein loading of microparticles ( see Note 3 ) . aAPC Immunotherapy 349 3 . 4 BCA Assay to Detect Total IL - 2 Loading 1 . Mass out 2 mg of IL - 2 loaded , avidin - coated microparticles into eppendorf tubes and wash once with DI water by adding 1 mL water and centrifuging at 2319 . 85 (cid:3) g for 5 min and removing supernatant . 2 . Dissolve particles by adding 500 μ L 1 M NaOH with 1 % SDS , followed by mixing using a vortex and sonication in water bath . Allow particle degradation to occur for at least 30 min on a plate shaker or until solution is clear . 3 . To create a standard , dissolve 2 mg empty , avidin - coated microparticles in 500 μ L of the same NaOH / SDS solution , allowing to degrade for 30 min on plate shaker . 4 . As not to interfere with BCA detection , the concentration of NaOH / SDS must be kept under 10 % . Therefore , dilute sam - ples either 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 , depending on how much protein you expect to be encapsulated ( we recommend starting with both dilutions ) . For a 1 : 10 dilution , add 4 . 5 mL PBS to 0 . 5 mL particle / NaOH solution in a new eppendorf . For a 1 : 100 dilution , add 0 . 5 mL of 1 : 10 solution to 4 . 5 mL PBS in a new eppendorf . 5 . Calculate how much BCA Working Reagent ( WR vol ) will be needed by multiplying the number of wells used ( including standard wells ) by 0 . 15 mL . 6 . Mix WR following manufacturer instructions ( adding 0 . 5 * vol A , 0 . 48 * vol B , 0 . 02 * vol C ) . 7 . Add 150 μ L samples in triplicate to wells in a 96 well plate . 8 . For standards , add 150 μ L of 1 : 10 and / or 1 : 100 diluted blank particles to each well in a row , then serially dilute with protein of interest ( or BSA standard from BCA kit if protein of interest is unavailable / expensive ) . 9 . Add 150 μ L WR to every well with protein solution in it . 10 . Incubate at 37 (cid:1) C for 2 h . Fig . 4 Representative SEM image of microparticles . Adapted from [ 1 ] 350 Alyssa L . Siefert et al . 11 . Read plate at absorbance 562 nm and follow the manufac - turer’s instructions to determine the protein concentrations . 3 . 5 Surface Modiﬁcation with pMHC and Antibodies Biotinylated ligands , such as pMHC and antibodies against CD28 and CD3 , are added to avidin - coated aAPCs immediately before use , employing the following method : 1 . Calculate the desired mass of aAPCs and ligand coating for experiments . In published reports , 1 μ g ligand is added per mg of aAPC [ 7 , 10 ] , though it is advised to titrate surface ligand density for optimal T cell stimulation . 2 . Create a 10 mg / mL solution of aAPC in sterile PBS in an eppendorf . In another eppendorf , create an equimolar solution of anti - CD28 and anti - CD3 or , if available , pMHC at 10 μ g / mL . 3 . Add desired amount of surface ligand cocktail to aAPC solu - tion and allow to tumble on a rotisserie for 20 min at room temperature . 4 . Wash particles by adding PBS with 1 % ( v / v ) Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) to eppendorf tube , spinning down at 5600 RCF for 5 min , and removing supernatant . 5 . Resuspend ligand - coupled aAPCs in complete RMPI - 10 tissue culture medium for in vitro studies ( see Note 4 for instructions for in vivo experiments ) . 3 . 6 Antigen - Speciﬁc T Cell Expansion Effective aAPCs will activate and expand antigen - speciﬁc T Cells . For clinical work , tumor - speciﬁc antigens or antigenic peptides are incorporated into aAPC platforms for incubation with autologous T cells . For proof - of - concept and murine studies , the antigenic peptide of model antigen ovalbumin ( OVA ) is loaded onto bioti - nylated pMHC complexes for incubation with OVA - speciﬁc T cells from transgenic mice . The spleens of OT - I mice ( Jackson Lab ) are transgenic mice bred to be enriched with OVA - speciﬁc CD8 + T cells . The following protocol stimulates and expands CD8 + T cells : 1 . In a tissue culture hood , harvest T cells from the spleen of an OT - I mouse by using the back of a 5 mL syringe to mash the spleen through a cell strainer into a 50 mL Falcon tube , rinsing with sterile PBS . ( a ) Spin cells down at 1200 rpm for 5 min , discard superna - tant , and add 5 mL ACK Lysing buffer to remove erythrocytes . ( b ) Incubate 5 min at room temperature . ( c ) Add 10 mL PBS , pellet cells , and discard supernatant . 2 . Isolate CD8 + T cells using CD8 + negative selection kit , fol - lowing manufacturer instructions . aAPC Immunotherapy 351 3 . Resuspend T cells in complete RPMI media ( see Note 5 ) . 4 . Titrate surface - ligated aAPCs , suspended in media , in 96 well round - bottom plates , with a 100 μ L volume per well . The highest aAPC concentration should not exceed a 1 : 1 molar ratio with T cells . 5 . Add CD8 + T cells to each well for a ﬁnal cell concentration of 5 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / mL . 6 . Allow aAPCs to stimulate CD8 + T cells for 3 days in tissue culture incubator set to 37 (cid:1) C and 5 . 0 % CO 2 . 7 . Centrifuge plates at 208 . 7865 (cid:3) g for 7 min and remove supernatant for ELISA analysis of proliferative cytokines IFN - γ and IL - 2 , following manufacturer instructions . 4 Notes 1 . Experiments should use freshly hydrated and surface - modiﬁed aAPCs . It is not recommended to store aAPCs that have been coupled to biotinylated ligands . 2 . Lyopholized aAPCs may be stored at (cid:4) 80 (cid:1) C for up to 3 years . 3 . To determine IL - 2 protein loading of microparticles , a BCA protein detection assay may be used on either the supernatant of microparticles incubated in PBS at 37 (cid:1) C for at least 1 week or on dissolved microparticles . The former method quantiﬁes the amount of IL - 2 released in physiologic conditions for a desired time range and is advised if researchers want to quantify the amount of IL - 2 available to T cells . The latter method will yield the total amount of protein incorporated into particles , regardless of the amount released , and can only be used if empty particles , surface - modiﬁed with avidin , are used as a control , as the BCA will yield a positive signal for both avidin - palmitate and IL - 2 . Finally , while researchers may use an IL - 2 Enzyme - Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) to quantify the amount of biologically active IL - 2 released from or encapsulated in microparticles , we recommend using the more affordable BCA assay during particle optimization . Addi - tionally , because of its conformational speciﬁcity , the IL - 2 ELISA may only detect a fraction of IL - 2 in particles . 4 . For in vivo studies , suspend surface - modiﬁed aAPCs in sterile PBS before animal injections . 5 . Tissue culture media may need to be supplemented with addi - tional glutamine and changed frequently , as proliferating T cells exhibit high metabolism . 352 Alyssa L . Siefert et al .

Peritoneal tumors are directly accessible by intraperitoneal injections . Previously we demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of nanoparticles and subsequent ingestion by tumor - associated phagocytes can be used to either directly impact tumors or stimulate antitumor immune responses . Here we outline methods to speciﬁcally utilize iron oxide nanoparticles with the ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A murine ovarian cancer model and discuss the tendency of phagocytes to ingest nanoparticles and the potential of phago - cytes to carry nanoparticles to tumors resulting in direct killing of tumor cells or stimulate antitumor immune responses in peritoneal cancers . This basic approach can be modiﬁed as needed for different types of tumors and nanoparticles . Key words Peritoneal cavity , Peritoneal tumor , Intraperitoneal injection , Nanoparticles , Tumor - associated phagocytes , Antitumor immune responses , Iron oxide nanoparticles , ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A , Ovarian cancer 1 Introduction It is now clear that the immune system plays a major role in the interaction between tumors and the patient carrying the tumors . The immune system recognizes tumors and moves to attack and eliminate tumors [ 1 ] , but the tumors that become large enough to become a clinical issue ( as opposed to those eliminated by the immune system before anyone ever knew they existed ) , invariably manifest local immunosuppression mechanisms that protect them . Rather than coexisting with the immune system , tumors manipu - late both themselves and certain immune cells for protection from other immune cells [ 2 ] . Phagocytes of various sorts such as mono - cytes , macrophages , dendritic cells , and neutrophils play a major role in this interplay as the backbone of what is termed the innate immune system . This role in service of tumors is often as immuno - suppressive cells that are recruited by the tumor and suppress attack Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 22 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 355 by other components of the immune system , a role attributed broadly to “myeloid derived suppressive cells” ( MDSC ) of various sorts [ 3 ] . This information is important in the context of immuno - therapy and nanoparticle ( NP ) - mediated cancer treatment , because NP experimentalists generally go to great pains to avoid the inges - tion of NPs by phagocytes [ 4 ] . Here we discuss ideas of how the tendency of phagocytes to ingest NPs can be exploited for cancer therapy using nanoparticles . Most people , when considering immunology , focus on lym - phocytes , ( B and T cells ) , and their role in adaptive immunity . The vast majority of specialized immune cells are not lymphocytes , they are other leukocytes , referred to loosely as innate immune cells and they are very important in both starting and stopping the overall immune response , including the response against tumors . These innate cells can be either immunosuppressive and block immune responses , or immunostimulatory and support and generate immune responses [ 2 ] . As we consider how NPs can be utilized it is important to note that while most of us think about a direct effect on tumor cells when we consider NP - mediated cancer therapy , we should also consider that NPs can manipulate immune cells and support the antitumor immune response . This is particularly rele - vant for innate immune cells that actively ingest NPs they encoun - ter . One idea to consider is that rather than trying to avoid ingestion of NPs by phagocytes , for example by coating them with polyethylene glycol [ 2 , 5 ] , there are ways to exploit the uptake of NPs by phagocytes to for example , eliminate immunosuppressive phagocytes or modify them to be immunostimulatory and thereby support the antitumor immune response [ 6 , 7 ] . Mouse studies of cancer depend on various mouse cancer mod - els and each model has unique strengths and weaknesses . Many common cancer types arise in the peritoneal cavity and metastasize there , at least initially . These include liver , colon , ovarian , stomach , pancreatic , and kidney cancers . It is important to consider that access to such cancers is through the blood stream , as with all cancers , but also through the peritoneal region itself , reagents injected into the peritoneum often have direct access to peritoneal tumor surfaces . In addition , phagocytes in the peritoneum are recruited to support the cancer and can be manipulated by intra - peritoneal ( IP ) application of nanoparticles , as technically pre - sented here . Parental ID8 murine ovarian surface epithelial cancer cell line [ 8 ] and ID8 cell lines transduced either with vascular endothelial growth factor A ( Vegf - A ) ( ID8 - Vegf - A ) or Vegf - A and β - defensin - 29 ( Defb29 ) ( ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A ) [ 9 ] are transplantable mouse models of ovarian cancer that establish tumors in syngeneic C57BL / 6 mice . The models vary by aggressiveness and speed of cancer development with ID8 being the least aggressive and ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A much more aggressive with an end - stage of about 356 Mee Rie Sheen and Steven Fiering 40 days . All three models accurately recapitulate characteristics of metastatic serous human ovarian cancer following IP inoculation , including tumor dissemination throughout the peritoneal cavity , development of ascites ( excessive ﬂuid in the abdomen ) , and recruitment and accumulation of great numbers of leukocytes such as tumor - associated immunosuppressive phagocytes in the peritoneal cavity [ 9 – 13 ] . These leukocytes are being recruited to the peritoneum by signals from the tumor and are subsequently entering the tumors themselves . Ovarian tumor cells and immune cells in the peritoneal cavity are easily accessible by IP injection , making it an excellent model for the study of NPs interaction with peritoneal cancers since the surface of the tumors and the leuko - cytes are both in direct contact with IP injected NPs [ 7 ] . Cancer nanotechnology includes the development and utiliza - tion of nanocarrier systems for therapeutic applications , which can be composed of bioactive entities , such as small - molecule drugs , peptides , proteins , and nucleic acids , and of nanosensor devices for detecting cancers , such as diagnostic devices , contrast agents , and analytical tools . This ﬁeld is one of the most rapidly growing areas in cancer research with great potential [ 14 ] . NPs are broadly deﬁned as particles with a diameter in the range of 10 – 200 nm . NPs have many potential uses for cancer therapy since they can be loaded with a variety of reagents in addition to manifesting the fundamental properties of the NP itself . NPs can be engineered with a wide range of functional surface / core properties , assembled and administered in vivo [ 14 ] . One metallic particle , iron oxide nanoparticles ( IONPs ) have attracted considerable interest due to features including magnetic properties , biocompatibility , solubility over time in vivo , stability , and non - toxicity [ 15 ] . As noted above , the tendency of NPs to be ingested by phago - cytes can be utilized to manipulate the phagocytes and this can be immunostimulatory [ 14 ] . To illustrate this and related ideas concerning NPs and immunotherapy we outline and provide meth - ods for the study of the ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A ovarian tumor model . NPs in this context are taken up by innate phagocytic cells travers - ing into the tumor and will carry those NPs and any NP they carry deep into the tumors themselves [ 7 ] . This is analogous to the Trojan horse that was brought by the Trojans into their city and led to their demise at the hands of the Greeks . Isolation of peritoneal cells by collecting tumor ascites ( perito - neal lavage supernatant ) following IP injection of IONPs is an important technique for studying interactions between NPs and the peritoneal tumor and immune cells . The magnetic property of IONPs enables use of the MACS ® column to gently separate mag - netically labeled cells harboring IONPs . Subsequently the positively selected and magnetically labeled cell fraction from a heterogenous cell suspension can be spun onto the slides by use of cytospin technique and used for cytochemistry to visualize and evaluate the Exploiting Nanoparticles Uptake by Phagocytes for Cancer Therapy 357 selected iron - containing cells . Prussian blue stain is a common way to detect the presence of iron in cells and tissues , which forms the purple Prussian blue dye in place and can be visualized as blue precipitate . Alternatively the positively selected and ﬂow through cells ( those not carrying IONPs ) can be evaluated for cell types and effector function by ﬂow cytometry and in vitro assays . In the following sections , with the example of IP injection of IONPs and ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A mouse ovarian cancer model , we describe methods to separate immune cells in the peritoneal cavity that ingests IONPs followed by IP injection and to visualize IONPs - harboring cells . 2 Materials 2 . 1 Injection of ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A Ovarian Tumor Cells and Bionized NanoFerrite ( BNF ) - Starch Coated IONPs 1 .

Culture ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A cells and harvest when cells reach 80 – 85 % conﬂuence . In such conditions cells should be more than 96 % viable ( see Note 1 ) . 2 . Inoculate 1 . 5 (cid:1) 10 6 ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A cells via intraperito - neal injection to establish tumor masses in the peritoneal cavity by disinfecting the injection site and injecting with a 25 – 27 gauge needle into the abdomen on the mouse’s right side at about a 30 (cid:3) angle to avoid puncturing the cecum or other internal organs ( see Notes 2 and 3 ) . 3 . At the desired time point after tumor inoculation ( in this example , 4 weeks ) administer BNF - starch coated IONPs ( or nanoparticle of choice ) intraperitoneally to mice bearing ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A tumor . 4 . Next day , sacriﬁce the mouse by euthanasia with carbon dioxide gas inhalation . Exploiting Nanoparticles Uptake by Phagocytes for Cancer Therapy 359 5 . After sacriﬁce of the mouse , spray the mouse and tools with 70 % ( v / v ) ethanol . 6 . Insert a 23 gauge needle parallel to the peritoneal membrane in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen , slowly inject 5 – 10 mL of ice cold 1 (cid:1) phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) into the peritoneal cavity , and gently massage the mouse abdomen to incorporate free cells into the PBS ( see Note 4 ) . 7 . After injection , collect the peritoneal ﬂuid slowly with the same syringe avoiding blood contamination if possible ( often the peritoneum itself is bloody from ID8 - Defb29 / Vegf - A tumors , but generally not before 4 weeks ) . If the needle gets clogged by fat tissue organs , gently move the tip of the needle around a little to enable collection of PBS wash . 8 . Collect as much ﬂuid as possible and deposit the collected ﬂuid in a tube and place on ice . 9 . To recover as much ﬂuid as possible , cut through the skin and peritoneum with a scissors , and collect the remaining ﬂuid from the peritoneal cavity using a 1 mL pipette while holding up the skin with a forceps , but again avoid blood as much as possible . 10 . Centrifuge the peritoneal lavage ﬂuid at 250 (cid:1) g for 5 min ( preferably at 4 (cid:3) C ) , discard the supernatant and disperse the cell pellet by gently tapping ( see Note 5 ) . 11 . If there is obvious blood , add 1 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer to the pellet for every 5 mL of the original peritoneal lavage ﬂuid , completely resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down , and incubate on ice for 5 min with occasional shaking . 12 . Stop red blood cell lysis by adding 10 mL of ice cold 1 (cid:1) PBS to the tube and then centrifuge at 250 (cid:1) g for 5 min ( preferably at 4 (cid:3) C ) . 13 . Discard the supernatant and disperse the cell pellet by gently tapping . 14 . Repeat steps 11 – 13 until the cell pellet appears white or light pink , indicating effective red blood cell lysis . 15 . Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of ice cold 1 (cid:1) PBS , pass the suspension through 40 μ m cell strainer and rinse the tube and the cell strainer with an additional 1 mL of ice cold 1 (cid:1) PBS ( see Note 6 ) . 16 . Discard the cell strainer and count cells using a hemocytometer . 17 . Resuspend total cells in the appropriate ﬁnal volume ( up to 10 8 total cells in 500 μ L of degassed column running buffer ) to proceed with MACS column separation . 360 Mee Rie Sheen and Steven Fiering 3 . 2 Magnetically Labeled Cells Separation by MACS LS Columns Pick the optimal column based on the sample sizes and following applications . 1 . Attach magnetic MidiMACS Separator to the MACS MultiStand . 2 . Place LS column with the column wings to the front into MACS Separator and set up a labeled tube under the magnet and column to collect ﬂow through ( see Note 7 ) . The MACS Column matrix provides a magnetic ﬁeld strong enough to retain cells labeled with minimal amounts of magnetic material . 3 . To prepare LS column , apply 3 mL of degassed column run - ning buffer on top of the column and rinse the column by letting the column running buffer run through ( see Note 8 ) . MACS columns should not be allowed to run dry . 4 . Discard efﬂuent and change the collection tube . The LS col - umn is now ready for magnetic separation ( see Note 9 ) . 5 . Completely resuspend up to 10 8 total cells from the peritoneal lavage ﬂuid in 500 μ L of degassed column running buffer . ( For higher total cell numbers , scale up the volume of running buffer accordingly . ) ( see Note 10 ) . 6 . Apply the cell suspension onto the prepared LS column and then collect the ﬂow through , which contains the unlabeled negative cell fraction . IONPs - containing cells are retained on the column , while cells lacking IONPs ﬂow through . 7 . Wash the LS column with 3 mL degassed column running buffer three times by adding running buffer each times once the column reservoir is almost empty . Collect total efﬂuent and this also contains the unlabeled cell fraction . 8 . Remove the LS column from the MACS separator magnet and place the column on a new collection tube . 9 . Pipette 5 mL of buffer onto the LS column then immediately ﬂush out the retained cell fraction by ﬁrmly applying the plunger supplied with the column to elute the magnetically labeled cells that were retained on the column by the magnet . To increase the purity , the positive cell fraction can be passed over a new , freshly prepared LS column for separation of up to 1 (cid:1) 10 8 magnetically labeled cells . 3 . 3 Cytospin of Separated Cells by MACS Column 1 . Count separated cells using a hemocytometer and dilute a cell suspension to have a concentration of 1 (cid:1) 10 5 cells per mL . 2 . Wash cells twice with 1 mL ice cold 10 % ( v / v ) FBS - containing media or PBS and resuspend cells in 150 μ L of ice cold 10 % ( v / v ) FBS - containing media or PBS . Be sure to keep cells on ice ( see Notes 11 and 12 ) . 3 . Prepare glass microscope slides by coating with poly - L - lysine , which produces an adhesive surface , and pre - label the slides ( see Note 13 ) . Exploiting Nanoparticles Uptake by Phagocytes for Cancer Therapy 361 4 . Remove the rotor from the Cytocentrifuge ( see Note 14 ) . 5 . Prepare slide by placing a poly - L - lysine coated glass slide and one disposable white ﬁlter card with two holes on top of the slide into the slide Cytoclip . Next place the single sample chamber ( Cytofunnel ) onto the white ﬁlter card . Be sure that each ﬁlter card and slide pair are ﬂush with each other and line up the holes in proper position so that the cells will be forced onto the slide . 6 . Load 1 (cid:1) 10 5 cells in a volume of 150 μ L of ice cold 10 % ( v / v ) FBS - containing media or PBS into the sample chamber then mix well by pipetting up and down ( see Notes 15 and 16 ) . 7 . Remove the cover of the rotor by pulling up on the silver lift tab in the center . Place each Cytoclip assembly ( slide , white ﬁlter card , sample chamber , and Cytoclip ) into the Cytospin head and balance them out . 8 . Replace the rotor cover by pulling up on the silver lift tab , and pushing it down until it locks into place . Place the rotor into the Cytocentrifuge . 9 . Adjust the setting on the Cytocentrifuge to get the correct setting for the protocol , in this case , spin at 120 (cid:1) g for 5 min . Push the start button to begin . 10 . After cytocentrifugation , remove the rotor and the cover of the rotor , and remove each Cytoclip assembly without disarran - ging it . 11 . Carefully detach the sample chamber and the white ﬁlter card without contacting the smears on the slide to avoid damaging the fresh cytospin . 12 . Prepare a slide again by placing a poly - L - lysine coated glass slide and one disposable white ﬁlter card on top of the slide upside down into the slide Cytoclip to adhere cells to the second hole . Then place the single sample chamber ( Cytofunnel ) onto the white ﬁlter card . 13 . Repeat steps 6 – 11 . 14 . Replace the rotor once empty . Wash the sample chamber in the sink . If infectious agents , such as bacteria , were used , wash the sample chamber with 10 % ( v / v ) bleach solution . Allow the sample chamber to completely dry . 15 . Air dry the slides for a few minutes and examine each slide under the microscope to be sure that the cells are reasonably dispersed . The cells should appear to have normal morphology . 16 . Dry the slides in a desiccation chamber or air dry overnight . 17 . Proceed with immediate ﬁxation or store the cytospun slides at (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C until ready for staining . 362 Mee Rie Sheen and Steven Fiering 3 . 4 Visualization of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles - Harboring Cells by Iron Stain with Gomori Prussian Blue This method is used to detect ferric iron in tissue sections . Use acid cleaned glassware for Prussian blue staining steps . If any residual iron solution remains on the staining glassware , then diffuse back - ground staining will occur ( see Note 17 ) . 1 . Fix the dried cytospun slides by immersion in precooled ace - tone ( at (cid:4) 20 (cid:3) C ) or 10 % ( v / v ) buffered formalin for 10 min ( see Note 18 ) . 2 . Pour off the ﬁxative and allow ﬁxative solution to evaporate from the slides for 20 min at room temperature . 3 . Rinse ﬁxed slides with two changes of 1 (cid:1) PBS for 10 min each . 4 . Mark the area around the cytocentrifuged cells with a water repellent PAP pen , liquid blocker . 5 . Hydrate the slides in distilled water for 5 min . 6 . Mix equal parts of Solution A ( 20 % ( v / v ) Hydrochloric acid aqueous solution ) and Solution B ( 10 % ( w / v ) Potassium fer - rocyanide aqueous solution ) before use to make a working solution . 7 . Place slides ( including positive and negative controls ) in the working solution for 20 min . 8 . Rinse the slides with distilled water 3 – 4 times . 9 . Place slides in Solution C ( 1 % ( w / v ) nuclear fast red stain solution ) for 5 min to counterstain cell nuclei ( see Note 19 ) . 10 . Rinse the slides twice with distilled water . 11 . Air dry the slides or dehydrate through graded ethyl alcohols ( we recommend 10 , 30 , 50 , 70 % ( v / v ) and ﬁnally two changes of 100 % ethanol ) and xylene or xylene substitute , and place a coverslip on top with a mounting medium , Permount ( see Note 20 ) . 12 . Examine the stained slide under the microscope . Ferric iron deposits will be dark blue , nucleus is dark red , and cytoplasm is light red or pink ( Fig . 1 ) . 4 Notes 1 . Cells should be thawed 4 – 5 days prior to tumor challenge and quickly harvested when at 80 – 85 % conﬂuence to ensure good viability . 2 . Inserting the needle on the mouse’s right side of the abdomen avoids puncturing the cecum , a large ﬂuid - ﬁlled organ on the left side . The small intestines on the right side are less likely to be punctured by the needle . The needle should enter to a depth of about half a centimeter . Exploiting Nanoparticles Uptake by Phagocytes for Cancer Therapy 363 3 . Aspirate once the needle has entered the abdomen to be sure that the needle has not penetrated the blood vessels or organs . For example , greenish brown aspirate indicates needle penetra - tion into the intestines , and yellow aspirate indicates needle penetration into the urinary bladder . If any such ﬂuid is aspi - rated into the needle , it indicates the solution is contaminated and must be discarded , and the injection procedure repeated with a new needle and syringe . 4 . Insert the needle slowly and carefully into the peritoneum to avoid puncture of any organs or signiﬁcant blood vessels . 5 . After centrifugation , the cell pellet might be visible and tight , if not , remove about half of the supernatant and mix thoroughly . 6 . Any visible chunks remaining in the cell suspension indicate the lysis / wash step is ineffective . Each time , the pellet must be completely dispersed and resolved . 7 . MACS LS column capacity is 1 (cid:1) 10 8 magnetically labeled cells from up to 2 (cid:1) 10 9 total cells when manually separating . Column capacity may decrease when isolating larger cells than lymphocytes . Total enrichment rate is 50 - fold to 1000 - fold depending on the speciﬁcity and strength of the magnetic labeling . Typical ﬂow rate of LS column for PBS is 1 . 3 – 2 . 0 mL / min . 8 . Degas buffer before use by applying vacuum . Excessive gas in MACS column running buffer will form bubbles in the matrix inside of the column during cell separation and could block the column leading to clogging of the column and decreasing the quality of separation . 9 . Do not store columns after rinsing , and use the column imme - diately to avoid formation of air bubbles . 10 . Particles larger than 30 μ m are not suitable for MACS separa - tion with LS columns . To remove clumps and prevent Fig . 1 Prussian blue staining of cytospin cells separated by MACS column .

Cells can be resuspended in 1 % BSA - containing media or PBS instead . 12 . Fetal bovine serum provides nutrients to keep the cells healthy and alive throughout the cytospin procedure [ 16 ] . 13 . Glass slides should be clean before coating . Clean slides with 1 % ( v / v ) HCl in 70 % ( v / v ) ethanol ( acid alcohol ) . Allow 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) poly - L - lysine solution to be room temperature before use . Place clean slides in 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) poly - L - lysine solution for 5 min . Dry slides in 60 (cid:3) C oven for 1 h or overnight at room temperature [ 17 – 19 ] . 14 . The rotor must be removed from the cytocentrifuge before opening or closing the cover on the rotor . The rotor is very delicate and must be handled with care . 15 . Load the sample in at least 100 μ L and no more than 250 μ L although the maximum sample volume for the white ﬁlter card is up to 500 μ L . 16 . When very few cells are available , load 100 μ L of ice cold 1 % BSA - containing media or PBS ( or 10 % FBS - containing media or PBS ) without cells into the sample chamber and spin at 120 (cid:1) g for 1 – 2 min . This will wet the ﬁlter card allowing more cells to reach the slide . 17 . Clean glassware with acid alcohol , rinse thoroughly in distilled water , and dry . 18 . Acetone ﬁxative allows better antibody penetration but may wash out some antigen , especially in the case of cytosolic proteins . Avoid chromate ﬁxatives when using glassware for staining . 19 . Shake Solution C well before use . Do not ﬁlter . 20 . The stained slides can be mounted with any compatible mounting medium .

McBride * , Dominique N . Price * , and Pavan Muttil Abstract This chapter details the intratracheal delivery of dry powder microparticles termed nano - in - microparticles ( NIMs ) for the purpose of in vivo targeted pulmonary drug delivery . The dry powder NIMs technology improves on previous inhaled chemotherapy platforms designed as liquid formulations . Dry powder microparticles were created through the process of spray drying ; a protocol detailing the formulation of NIMs dry powder is included as a separate chapter in this book . Dry powder NIMs containing ﬂuorescent nanoparticles and magnetically - responsive superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are intratracheally delivered ( insufﬂated ) in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld and targeted to the left lung of mice . The targeting efﬁciency of dry powder NIMs is compared to the targeting efﬁciency of liquid NIMs to demonstrate the superiority of dry power targeting platforms . Targeting is assessed using ﬂuorescence associated with NIMs detected in the mouse trachea , left lung , and right lung by an in vivo imaging system .

Pulmonary drug delivery systems offer many advantages over traditional drug delivery sys - tems [ 1 ] . First and foremost , drugs can be delivered regionally instead of systemically , directly to the disease site . Regional delivery allows for a lower drug dose to be used , often resulting in fewer systemic side effects . Also , barriers obstructing therapeutic efﬁcacy are bypassed , such as poor gastrointestinal absorption and ﬁrst - pass metabolism of drugs in the liver . In addition , pulmonary delivery is noninvasive and “needle - free” allowing for a wide range of Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 23 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 * These authors contributed equally to this work . 369 substances to be delivered , from small molecules to very large proteins [ 2 ] . The lungs have an enormous absorptive surface area ( 100 m 2 ) and a highly permeable membrane ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 7 μ m thick - ness ) in the alveolar region [ 3 ] . Large molecules with low gastroin - testinal absorption rates can be absorbed in signiﬁcant quantities due to the slow mucociliary clearance in the lung periphery result - ing in prolonged residence in the lung [ 4 ] . Futhermore , inhalable drugs formulated as dry powders have many additional advantages . Dry powders have greater chemical and physical stability compared to aqueous dispersions for nebuli - zation and thus often have increased product shelf lives and may not require refrigeration during storage . A nebulized suspension can prematurely release the drug payload , whereas we have shown that an inhaled dry powder can overcome this limitation in an in vitro setting [ 5 ] . Compared to a nebulizer , inhaler devices used to deliver dry powders are more efﬁcient and less time - consuming . This reduces the overall treatment time and improves patient compliance . 1 . 2 History of Inhaled Chemotherapies Although the development of inhalational agents for oncological use in humans has been limited [ 6 ] , there is a large amount of published data regarding aerosol delivery of chemotherapy in pre - clinical studies . Futhermore feasibility of aerosol delivery has been shown using in vitro models [ 7 , 8 ] , animal models [ 9 – 15 ] , and Phase I / II human trials for various cancers [ 16 – 20 ] . In 1968 the chemotherapeutic agent , 5 - ﬂuorouracil ( 5 - FU ) , was investigated for inhalational therapy [ 21 ] . This study , published by Tatsumura and colleagues , treated patients with inhaled 5 - FU preceded by surgery . Study results showed that 5 - FU was found in higher concentrations in lung tumors than in the surrounding tissue . In a later study , Tatsumura et al . showed high 5 - FU concen - trations in the main bronchus and adjacent lymph nodes for nearly 4 h post - administration [ 18 ] . Furthermore , the formulation of 5 - FU with lipid - coated nanoparticles showed sustained drug release and enhanced anticancer properties [ 22 ] . Similarly , Otterson and colleagues evaluated inhaled doxorubicin in a Phase I , and later in a Phase I / II , clinical study and demonstrated the promising efﬁcacy of an aerosol treatment [ 16 , 17 ] . However , the non - targeted aero - sol delivery led to a moderate reduction of pulmonary function and pulmonary dose - limiting toxicity in some patients . It is therefore critical to target inhaled chemotherapeutics , beyond local delivery , to tumors to protect healthy lung tissue . None of the studies described above used a targeting mechanism within the lung . To this end , Azarmi et al . formulated poly ( butylcya - nocrylate ) nanoparticles with doxorubicin for inhaled , targeted drug delivery to the lung via encapsulation in lactose carrier particles made by spray - freeze drying [ 23 ] . This study showed successful in vitro uptake of the nanoparticles into H460 and A549 lung cancer lines 370 Amber A . McBride et al . through endocytosis rather than passive diffusion . Similarly , Dames et al . used a liquid suspension of magnetically - responsive superpar - amagnetic iron oxide nano - particles ( SPIONs ) and plasmid DNA ( pDNA ) ( used as a drug surrogate ) to target the different lobes of the lung in mice [ 11 ] . Unfortunately , while SPIONs were successful in tissue - targeting , pDNA was found to separate from the SPIONs during pulmonary administration . McBride and colleagues have for - mulated dry powder nano - in - microparticles ( NIMs ) , incorporating SPIONs and chemotherapeutics in a dry powder lactose matrix that prevented pre - separation of SPIONs and therapeutic while maintaining the size and ﬂow characteristics critical for lung delivery [ 5 ] . This formulation platform is detailed in another chapter of this book . 1 . 3 Micro - and Nanoparticles as Drug Delivery Vehicles Delivery vehicles ( nanoparticles ( NPs ) , microparticles , or nanoparti - cles encapsulated within microparticles can range in size from several nanometers to a few micrometers . Microparticles intended for inhaled drug delivery should be 1 – 3 μ m in size to achieve alveolar deposition [ 24 ] . Depending on the target delivery region , particles exhibit desirable particle size distribution ideally with aerodynamic diameters ( d a ) of 5 – 10 μ m for airways and 1 – 5 μ m for deep lung delivery with a standard density of 1 g / cm 3 . Particles less than 0 . 5 μ m ( NPs ) are driven by diffusion and are likely to be exhaled , hence they are often encapsulated and delivered within microparticles . This chapter describes targeted delivery of dry powder NIMs directly into the lungs of a mouse . NIMs are formulated to be magnetically - responsive , and can be used to target drug payloads to a particular lobe of the lung with the use of an external magnet [ 5 ] . NIMs dry powder matrixes have the beneﬁt of physically binding the magnet - targeting SPIONs and drug payload ( a ﬂuo - rescent dye is used as a drug surrogate for visualization ) . Con - versely , NIMs in a liquid suspension run the risk of SPION and drug separation , negating the targeting effect . To compare NIMs dry powder targeting efﬁciency to NIMs liquid suspension target - ing , administration of a liquid suspension to mice using an intra - tracheal aerosolization device is also described below . 2 Materials 1 .

The DP - 4M Dry Powder Insufﬂator ™ is speciﬁcally developed for pulmonary dry powder administration to mice , and variants suitable for rats , guinea pigs , and larger animals exist ( see Fig . 1 ) . 3 Methods 3 . 1 Intratracheal Administration of Dry Powder to Mice 1 . Weigh mouse . 2 . Administer anesthesia ( see Note 1 ) . 3 . Weigh the clean insufﬂator , including the powder chamber and delivery tube . This initial weight will be used to calculate the ﬁnal amount of powders delivered into the mouse lung . 4 . Add 1 – 2 mg of dry powder NIMs to the insufﬂator chamber and close the chamber ( see Note 2 ) . Re - weigh the insufﬂator to ensure the proper powder amount has been loaded into the chamber . Fig . 1 A dry powder Insufﬂator ™ for mouse ( DP - 4M ) . The device consists of a total of three pieces . The dry powder chamber is made up of two pieces ; the chamber tube can be pulled apart and loaded with up to 2 mg of dry powder . To close the tube after the powder is loaded into the chamber , the two pieces are gently pressed together with pressure . The third piece of the device is the delivery tube and is attached by a screw thread to the delivery chamber tube . The delivery tube is 8 00 in length from the bend angle to the tip of the tube . The insufﬂation device is fragile and extreme care must be taken to immediately clean the insufﬂator to prevent clogging .

Place the anesthetized mouse supine on the plexiglass intuba - tion platform . 6 . The platform should be situated at a 60 (cid:3) angle facing away from you . The operator will be facing the head of the mouse . 7 . Using the incisor loop ( plastic ﬁshing line ) hang the front incisors ( teeth ) of the mouse from the loop . A thin rubber band can then be placed over the mouse to secure the mouse on the intubation platform . 8 . Using a cotton - tipped swab , gently roll the mouse tongue out of its mouth and to one side to expose the oropharynx . 9 . Insert the laryngoscope into the mouth of the mouse . Using the light and blade features , depress the tongue to view the epiglottis . Adding a magnifying glass to the laryngoscope han - dle ( using Velcro ) will aid in the clear visualization of the small tracheal opening in a mouse . A white round opening , indicated by the opening and closing of the arytenoid cartilage around the tracheal opening should be visible ( see Note 3 ) . 10 . The insufﬂator delivery tube ( cannula ) should be inserted down the trachea of the animal , gently proximal to the carina , until the curve of the cannula is positioned at the incisors . Attach the powder loaded chamber of the insufﬂator to the cannula . A 3 mL disposable plastic syringe is attached to the open end of the insufﬂator . 11 . With the mouse situated on the plexiglass delivery platform , place the magnet over left lung as the mouse faces away from you , as shown in Fig . 2 . 12 . To insufﬂate the powders , depress the syringe attached to the insufﬂator with steady , forceful pressure using not more than 500 μ L of air ( see Note 4 ) . 13 . Note number of puffs given ( see Note 5 ) . Reweigh the insuf - ﬂator after powder delivery ( delivery tube and powder cham - ber ) to quantify the amount of dry powder administered to the mouse lung . 14 . If non - signiﬁcant targeting exists ( based on in vivo imaging ) , surgically open the animal and cut through the skin / muscle to depth of the rib cage . Surgically expose the left lung by thora - cotomy ( see Note 6 ) . Then re - place the magnet 1 mm above the incision , with the magnet’s edge perpendicular to the upper section of the left lung . Follow steps 8 – 13 again to deliver NIMs dry powder using the insufﬂator . 15 . Sacriﬁce the mouse immediately .

Weigh mouse . 2 . Administer anesthesia ( see Note 1 ) . 3 . Add 1 . 5 mg NIMs ( see Note 2 ) to 0 . 5 mL saline and load into the aerosolization device . 4 . With the mouse situated on the intubation platform , place the magnet over the left lung as mouse faces you ( see Note 3 ) . 5 . Insert the laryngoscope into the mouth . Using the light and blade features , depress the tongue to view the epiglottis . Fig . 2 Targeting NIMs to the left lung during insufﬂation using a permanent magnet . The mouse has been intubated with the insufﬂator . A magnet is held over the left lung lobe . NIMs will be dispersed into the lungs when the syringe plunger attached to the insufﬂator is depressed . NIMs will preferentially target the left lung compared to the right due to the magnetic ﬁeld 374 Amber A . McBride et al . Adding a magnifying glass to the laryngoscope handle ( using Velcro ) will aid in the clear visualization of the small tracheal opening in a mouse . You should see a white round opening , indicated by the opening and closing of the arytenoid cartilage around the tracheal opening . 6 . The liquid intratracheal aerosolization device should be inserted the trachea of the animal gently , proximal to the carina , until the curve of the cannula is positioned at the incisors . 7 . To aerosolize the formulation , the plunger should be depressed ﬁrmly and with consistent force and speed ( see Note 7 ) . Once the plunger has been completely depressed , the liquid suspen - sion will be administered into the mouse lung . 8 . Carefully remove the aerosolizer delivery tube from the mouse trachea . 9 . Sacriﬁce the mouse immediately . Remove lungs and trachea en bloc and separate ( right lung , left lung and trachea ) into dis - tinct tissues for NIMs - targeting efﬁciency to the magnetized . These tissues can be assessed for ﬂuorescence and iron quantiﬁcation . 3 . 4 Comparison of Targeting Efﬁcacy 1 . Evaluate the presence of dye by measuring the ﬂuorescence of each tissue ( right lung , left lung , and trachea ) ( see Notes 8 and 9 ) . Compare targeting efﬁciency of dye by ﬁrst calculating NIM - associated ﬂuorescence of each tissue over the total tissue ﬂuorescence . This will tell you the percent of dye targeted to each tissue , and whether more dye was targeted to the left lung versus the right lung : % Dye targeted to right lung ¼ Fluorescene in right lung Total fluorescence ð right lung þ left lung þ trachea Þ % Dye targeted to left lung ¼ Fluorescene in left lung Total fluorescence ð right lung þ left lung þ trachea Þ % Dye targeted to trachea ¼ Fluorescene in trachea Total fluorescence ð right lung þ left lung þ trachea Þ 2 . Evaluate the presence of SPIONs by measuring iron content in each tissue ( right lung , left lung , and trachea ) ( see Note 10 ) . Compare targeting efﬁciency of SPIONs by ﬁrst calculating the SPION - associated iron content of each tissue over the SPION - associated iron content of the total tissue . This will tell you the percent of SPIONs targeted to each tissue , and whether more SPIONs were targeted to the left lung versus the right lung : Pulmonary Delivery of Nano - in - Microparticles 375 % SPIONs targeted to right lung ¼ Iron in right lung Total iron ð right lung þ left lung þ trachea Þ % SPIONs targeted to left lung ¼ Iron in left lung Total iron ð right lung þ left lung þ trachea Þ % SPIONs targeted to trachea ¼ Iron in trachea Total iron ð right lung þ left lung þ trachea Þ 3 . Determine whether the SPIONs separated from the dye during targeting by comparing percentages ( dye and SPIONs ) for each tissue . The percentage deposited in each tissue will be signiﬁcantly different if the SPIONs and dye separated during administration . 4 Notes 1 . We used 100 mg / kg and 10 mg / kg body weight of ketamine and xylazine by intraperitoneal injection , respectively , for anaesthesia dosing . 2 . Pre - weighing powders into a capsule speeds up the loading process and helps to ensure repeatability when loading similar amounts . For NIMs suspension ( liquid ) experiments we used the Penn Century Microsprayer ® aerosolization device . 3 . Morello et al . has published an excellent synopsis on the insuf - ﬂation of dry powders into the lung of a mouse [ 25 ] . 4 . Hoppentocht et al . recently published data stating that 200 μ L air volume , as recommended by the manufacturer , did not provide adequate dispersion of the NIMs in the insufﬂator leading to variable dry powder deposition in mouse lungs [ 26 , 27 ] . We conﬁrmed this observation and showed that a larger pulsed air volume of 500 μ L was required for adequate NIMs dispersion in the lungs using the mouse insufﬂator . However , a higher air volume may have led to signiﬁcant powder deposition in the trachea due to inertial impaction . 5 . In our experience , ten puffs administered 25 % of the dry powder NIMs loaded in the insufﬂator . The remaining 75 % remained in the insufﬂator . Administering more than ten puffs did not dislodge the remaining NIMs from the insufﬂator . 6 . A similar surgical protocol to expose the lungs for magnetic targeting is described by Dames et al . [ 11 ] . 7 . The force used to dispense the NIMs suspension from the liquid intratracheal aerosolization device was maintained at a constant rate . 376 Amber A . McBride et al . 8 . Signiﬁcantly more ﬂuorescence ( from the dye in the NIMs ) was quantiﬁed in the trachea for dry powder NIMs than liquid suspension . We attribute this pitfall to the DP - 4M insufﬂator delivery tool . The insufﬂator deposits the dry powder in the respiratory tract based on ﬁrm pushing of the syringe , which is necessary for the proper aerosolization and delivery of NIMs into the lung [ 25 ] . However , the high velocity air stream generated by the syringe ( attached to the insufﬂator ) leads to powder deposition in the upper conducting airways and the main tracheal bifurcation due to inertial impaction . Dry pow - der NIMs exiting the insufﬂator delivery tube had increased momentum and followed their trajectory until they collided with the tracheal wall [ 25 ] . NIMs that did not impact the upper respiratory tract were available for magnetic - targeting within the lung lobes . A passive dry powder inhaler that allows slow and deep inspiration may mitigate the upper respiratory tract deposition of NIMs . 9 . For each tissue ( right lung , left lung , and trachea ) , obtain total relative ﬂuorescent units ( rfu ) as well as region of interest rfus ( keeping the region of interest constant for each tissue ) . 10 . We used Inductively Coupled Plasma – Atomic Emission Spec - troscopy ( ICP - AES ) to determine tissue iron content . How - ever , it is important to note that when using this method you must have a tissue control to subtract out the endogenous iron content of the tissues .

Chapter 24 Neutron - Activatable Nanoparticles for Intraperitoneal Radiation Therapy Derek Hargrove and Xiuling Lu Abstract Intraperitoneal internal radiation therapy is a cancer treatment option that is employed in situations where surgical resection , systemic chemotherapy , and external beam radiotherapy are not amenable for patients . However , exposure of noncancerous tissues to radiation continues to be a hindrance to safe and effective treatment of patients . In addition , reducing prolonged radiation exposure of personnel during preparation of internal radiation therapy agents makes their manufacture complicated and hazardous . Developments in nanotechnology have provided a platform for targeted treatments that combine dual imaging and treat - ment capabilities all in one package , while also being robust enough to withstand the intense stresses faced during neutron activation . Here , we describe a method for synthesizing neutron activatable mesoporous silica nanoparticles for use in radiotherapy of metastatic peritoneal cancers while limiting personal exposure to radioactive materials , limiting the leakage of radioactive isotopes caused by nanoparticle degradation during neutron activation , and increasing cancer tissue speciﬁcity of radiation . Key words Nanotechnology , Neutron activation , Cancer , Radiation therapy , Intraperitoneal delivery 1 Introduction The peritoneal cavity is a common site of metastatic disease [ 1 , 2 ] from primary tumors found in the organs of the digestive tract and ovaries . Peritoneal metastatic disease is particularly characterized by poor patient outcomes and current treatment strategies include surgical resection in conjunction with intravenous chemotherapy [ 3 – 5 ] . In some cases , when patients fail to respond to these treatments , external beam radiation treatment is used . In general , these treatments are typically palliative in nature and are associated with high systemic toxicity [ 4 ] . In an effort to decrease the exposure of healthy tissues to harmful radiation and chemotherapeutics while also increasing local tumor exposure levels , intraperitoneal delivery of radiotherapeutics and chemotherapeutics has been employed [ 6 – 8 ] . Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 24 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 379 Nanomaterials provide a unique system that can increase the local concentration of radiotherapeutics with the ability to be tuned for speciﬁc tumor targeting through the use of targeting ligands [ 5 , 9 , 10 ] . If the particles have to be loaded with already radioactive materials , then the amount of exposure of the handlers during the synthesis of the nanoparticles may be high . These nano - carrier systems can be made radioactive after their manufacture using a neutron activation approach . However , in order for this to work , the particles have to be able to withstand the harsh environment of a nuclear reactor during neutron activation while still retaining its radioactive cargo and its targeting capabilities [ 11 , 12 ] . In the mesoporous silica nanoparticle system ( MSN ) described in Fig . 1 , we have demonstrated that the nanoparticles can be synthesized and loaded with a stable isotope of Holmium - 165 in a well - studied 4 - step process [ 13 – 17 ] without loss of cargo once it has been loaded [ 18 ] . The loaded nanoparticle can then be placed in a thermal neutron ﬂux for conversion of Holmium - 165 to its radioac - tive form of Holmium - 166 . Holmium - 166 is useful in the treatment of cancer due to its emission of high - energy β - particles while also providing imaging capabilities with single - photon emission com - puted tomography due to the emission of γ - photons [ 19 ] . The relatively short half - life of 26 . 8 h also allows for limited radiation exposure of the patient and caregiver after intraperitoneal adminis - tration . The mesoporous silica nanoparticle structure is robust enough to withstand prolonged time in thermal neutron ﬂux without the release of radioactive holmium [ 18 ] . The ability to make the particles radioactive post synthesis limits radiation exposure to the handlers and manufacturers of the particles , without sacriﬁ - cing the integrity of the product . Upon intraperitoneal administra - tion it has also been shown that these particles have the capability to selectively and passively accumulate in tumor tissues , thus limiting the exposure of healthy peritoneal tissues to radiation [ 18 ] . Fig . 1 Schematic of the synthesis pathway for Holmium - 166 mesoporous silica nanoparticles . Under basic conditions the surfactant forms positively charged micelles that interact with the negatively charged TEOS forming a well ordered , hexagonal pore array covered in silica . After reﬂuxing the particles in acidiﬁed methanol the surfactant is removed and all that is left are the hollow pores of the nanoparticles . Holmium acetylacetone ( Ho ( AcAc ) 3 ) can then be added to the pores and the entire particle can be placed in a neutron ﬂux to convert the stable Holmium - 165 to the radioisotope Holmium - 166 380 Derek Hargrove and Xiuling Lu The following protocol details the preparation of monodisperse mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with Holmium - 166 . This includes the synthesis of particles with a well ordered hexagonal pore structure , Holmium - 165 crystal preparation , loading the nanoparticles with the Holmium - 165 crystals , and proper nanopar - ticle preparation for converting the entrapped Holmium - 165 to the radioactive Holmium - 166 isotope using neutron activation without nanoparticle degradation . Along with a detailed descrip - tion of the preparation steps , multiple notes are introduced throughout the protocol in order to help bring attention to poten - tial preparation pitfalls along with insight into potential protocol alterations for the optimization of the nanoparticles for more spe - ciﬁc applications . 2 Materials Prepare all solutions using type 1 ( 18 . 2 M Ω cm at 25 (cid:1) C ) ultrapure water and analytical grade reagents .

Holmium chloride ( Acros Organics , Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) . Store at room temperature . 3 Methods Perform all procedures at room temperature and in a certiﬁed fume hood unless otherwise speciﬁed . 3 . 1 Preparation of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles 1 . Weigh out 0 . 2 g of CTAB powder in a weighing dish and transfer to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask . Add 100 mL of ultra - pure water to the Erlenmeyer ﬂask , add an appropriately sized Neutron Activatable Nanoparticles 381 magnetic stir bar to the ﬂask and cover the top with aluminum foil ( see Note 2 ) . Heat the solution using a water bath set to 80 (cid:1) C and stir the solution at 200 rpm until the solution becomes clear . 2 . Adjust the pH of the solution through the addition of 0 . 7 mL of 2 M NaOH . The pH of the solution should be 12 . Maintain the CTAB solution at 80 (cid:1) C and stirring at 200 rpm for 30 min ( see Note 3 ) . 3 . After the 30 min have passed , increased the stirring rate from 200 rpm to 800 rpm . Using a 100 μ L micropipette , add 1 mL of TEOS to the beaker in a dropwise fashion , making sure to drop one drop of TEOS every 30 s until the full volume is added ( see Note 4 ) . During this addition step the solution will become cloudy , indicating the formation of silica nanoparticles . 4 . Keep heating and stirring at 80 (cid:1) C and 800 rpm for 4 h . After this time , turn off the heat and allow the suspension to cool to room temperature while continually stirring for 12 additional hours . 5 . Transfer the suspension to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and centri - fuge at 12 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min . Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with methanol by resuspending the pellet in 30 mL of methanol and vortexing until a uniform suspension is created ( see Note 5 ) . Centrifuge the uniform suspension at 12 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min and then remove the supernatant . Repeat this step two additional times with methanol and then three additional times using ultrapure water . This should remove the excess surfactant and TEOS that has not formed particles . 6 . Following the last pellet wash with water , remove the superna - tant and add 40 mL of the acidiﬁed methanol to the centrifuge tube containing the washed particle pellet and resuspend by sonicating the suspension in a bath sonicator at room tempera - ture for 30 min ( see Note 6 ) . 7 . Transfer the uniform suspension to a clean 125 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask and stir it with a magnetic stir bar at 800 rpm for 24 h in order to remove the surfactant from the particles . After the 24 h period , transfer the solution to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 12 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min . Discard the superna - tant and then resuspend the pellet in another 40 mL of the acidiﬁed methanol using bath sonication , transfer the suspen - sion back to the 125 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask and stir it again at 800 rpm for 24 h ( see Note 7 ) . 8 . Transfer the suspension to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and centri - fuge at 12 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min . Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with methanol by resuspending the pellet in 30 mL of methanol and vortexing until a uniform suspension is 382 Derek Hargrove and Xiuling Lu created . Centrifuge the uniform suspension at 12 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min and then remove the supernatant . Repeat this step two additional times with methanol and then three additional times using ultrapure water . This should remove the excess surfactant and methanol from the particles . 9 . Following the last wash , place the centrifuge tube containing the washed nanoparticle pellet into a vacuum chamber and allow for the pellet to dry for 24 h ( see Note 8 ) . Store the dried pellet at 4 (cid:1) C . 3 . 2 Holmium Acetylacetonate Crystal Preparation 1 . Weigh out 18 g of acetylacetone in a 150 mL beaker . Add 100 mL of ultrapure water , cover with aluminum foil and mix with a magnetic stir bar at 150 rpm for 15 min . The pH for this solution should be between 3 and 4 . 2 . Slowly add ammonium hydroxide to the solution while it con - tinues to stir at 150 rpm until the pH is 8 . 5 . The solution should go from clear to yellow as the pH increases . 3 . Weigh out 1 g of holmium chloride and dissolve in 15 mL of water . Slowly add this solution to the pH adjusted acetylaceto - nate solution while it is still stirring at 150 rpm . Cover the beaker with aluminum foil and allow to stir for 24 h at room temperature . The formation of crystals will become apparent as the solution will over time become cloudy . 4 . Collect the holmium acetylacetonate crystals by pouring the suspension into B € uchner funnel lined with coarse ( particle retention > 20 μ m ) ﬁlter paper that is connected to a 500 mL ﬁltering ﬂask . Use vacuum to increase the rate of ﬁltration . The crystals should be pink in color . 5 . Wash the crystals by pouring 300 mL of ultrapure water and pulling vacuum to remove excess water . After washing the crys - tals with ultrapure water , carefully transfer the wet crystals to a 20 mL glass vial . Cover the top of the vial with aluminum foil and poke some small holes in the aluminum foil ( see Note 9 ) . Transfer the vial to a vacuum chamber and dry the crystals for 48 h . 3 . 3 Loading Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles with Holmium Acetylacetonate 1 . Weigh out 10 mg of holmium acetylacetonate crystals and dissolve in 5 mL of anhydrous ethanol . Add the solution to a 10 mL glass vial . Weight out 10 mg of the previously prepared mesoporous silica nanoparticle powder and add to the hol - mium acetylacetonate and ethanol solution . Bath - sonicate the mixture for 1 h in order to create a uniform suspension of particles ( see Note 10 ) . 2 . After the suspension is homogenous , add a magnetic stirrer to the vial and stir at 200 rpm and room temperature for 24 h . Neutron Activatable Nanoparticles 383 3 . Transfer the suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centri - fuge at 12 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min . Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with ethanol by resuspending the pellet in 10 mL of ethanol and mixing using a vortex until a uniform suspension is created ( see Note 11 ) . Centrifuge the uniform suspension at 12 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min and then remove the supernatant . Repeat this step two additional times with ethanol and then three additional times using ultrapure water . The remaining pellet is holmium loaded mesoporous silica nano - particles ( Ho - MSN ) . 4 . Transfer the centrifuge tube to a vacuum chamber and dry the nanoparticle pellet for 24 h . Store at 4 (cid:1) C until irradiation . 3 . 4 Neutron Activation of Holmium Loaded Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles 1 . Transfer around 1 mg of Ho - MSNs to the polypropylene sample vials in order to prepare for neutron activation ( see Note 12 ) . 2 . Depending on the amount of radioactivity needed for the particular experiment , calculate the irradiation time by using Eq . 1 ( see Note 13 ) . Samples should be packaged in accordance with the proper radiation safety regulations . A ¼ nf σ 1 (cid:4) e (cid:4) λ T (cid:1) (cid:3) e (cid:4) λ t ð 1 Þ Equation for determining the radioactivity produced in disin - tegrations per second , where n is the number of holmium atoms , f is the neutron ﬂux density of the nuclear reactor being used ( neutrons per cm 2 per second ) , σ is the thermal neutron capture cross section ( cm 2 ) , λ is the radiation decay constant , T is the irradiation time and t is the time between the end of irradiation and the count . 3 . After irradiating the samples in the thermal neutron ﬂux in a nuclear reactor facility for a speciﬁc time and returning to the lab following the radiation safety procedures , carefully remove the sample lids ( see Note 14 ) and resuspend the particles in the appropriate amount of sterile phosphate buffered saline or sterile serum free media to make a nanoparticle concentration of 1 mg / mL ( see Note 15 ) . 4 Notes 1 . The NaOH solution is usually not kept for more than 2 weeks and is preferably prepared fresh before each preparation . If stored , the pH is checked before every preparation to ensure no major changes have occurred . 2 . The use aluminum foil helps to prevent the loss of water from the system during heating . This allows us to maintain the 384 Derek Hargrove and Xiuling Lu concentration of surfactant well below the solubility point and also above the critical micelle concentration of 1 mM . It was found that aluminum foil worked best because of the necessity to constantly remove and replace the cover of the ﬂask during nanoparticle preparation . 3 . Adjusting the pH allows for the protonation of the surfactant and maintaining basic conditions is very important in order to properly form the hexagonal pore template upon which the silica source will form the particle . 4 . We found it easier to work with the Erlenmeyer ﬂask while it is stabilized in the water bath on a hot plate using a ring stand and adjustable clamp . Since the suspension will be spinning at a very high speed , it is imperative to keep the ﬂask from moving due to some potential partial boiling in the water bath so that the magnetic stir bar can consistently spin without interruption . It is easiest to peel back a small part of the aluminum foil cover and quickly place the micropipette underneath the lid to drop TEOS into the ﬂask . This will keep some of the water from evaporating . Slowly adding the TEOS drop by drop in 30 s intervals was found to form spherical particles of an even size distribution and prevent elliptical particles that do not fully form . 5 . If large particles of silica are ﬂoating around in the tube after vortexing , bath - sonicate the sample in 30 min intervals until the sample is completely uniform before centrifuging the sam - ple . If at all possible , avoid probe sonication of the sample . The coating on the probes has the potential to chip off into the sample . The extra microscopic metals can produce unwanted radioactive isotopes during irradiation . 6 . Do not proceed to the day long stirring step until the suspen - sion looks uniform . Continue bath sonication , checking every 30 min to see if the large particles have been separated . In the right image of Fig . 2 you can see some aggregation occurring even after sonication , so it is important to keep the particle suspension looking as uniform as possible to make sure all surfaces of the particle are exposed to the acidiﬁed methanol . 7 . This step may need to be repeated multiple times in order to fully remove the surfactant . Without proper removal of the surfactant , the pores will not fully form and the amount of holmium loaded will be less . In the left image of Fig . 2 you can see the ordered pores of the MSN after successful removal of the surfactant . 8 . The powder should be very ﬁne . If the pellet forms a single block of silica , try breaking the pieces up with a spatula and then upon resuspension , use bath sonication to break it back up into individual particles . Neutron Activatable Nanoparticles 385 9 . Make sure that the crystals are in a big enough container so that when vacuum is released the crystals are not sent airborne and out of your vessel completely . 10 . The length of sonication can vary depending on how agglom - erated the particles are . If resuspending the particles is a large issue , suspend the particles in the ethanol ﬁrst and sonicate for extended periods of time before adding the holmium acetyla - cetonate crystals . 11 . Use bath sonication if using a vortex is not enough to break up the large agglomerated particles . 12 . 1 mg is used in order to easily resuspend the particles at a concentration of 1 mg / mL for cell and mouse experiments . This should decrease your radiation exposure time if every - thing is pre - weighed before irradiation . 13 . In our experience we get about 20 % loading of elemental holmium to the nanoparticles . Therefore , our number of target atoms calculation is based on a holmium weight that is 20 % of the total weight of powder . The thermal neutron ﬂux and neutron capture cross section is determined by the nuclear facility and was 1 . 8 (cid:3) 10 13 n / cm 2 - s and 6 . 4 (cid:3) 10 (cid:4) 23 cm 2 , respectively . The half - life of Holmium is 26 . 8 h and the decay Fig . 2 TEM images of the prepared Holmium loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles . ( Left ) At a high magniﬁcation the well - ordered pores become visible . The magniﬁcation is 250 , 000 (cid:3) with a scale bar of 100 nm . ( Right ) The particles have a high tendency to aggregate , so it is important to sonicate the sample well during the synthesis . The magniﬁcation is 18 , 500 (cid:3) with a scale bar of 2 μ m . The average particle size is 120 nm using this preparation method 386 Derek Hargrove and Xiuling Lu constant is determined by calculating 0 . 693 / half - life . Irradia - tion time up to 8 h has shown to have no determinable stability issues ( holmium leaching from the pores , increased aggrega - tion , and degraded nanoparticle structure ) . For our purposes , the irradiation time never exceeded 8 h . If the nuclear facility is not readily available , make sure to factor in the amount of time spent removing the samples from irradiation in the nuclear facility , packaging and shipping time , and experiment time in the amount of radioactivity needed for a particular experiment . 14 . The vials will be quite ﬂimsy and also have the tendency to break in some cases due to the long periods of time spent in the reactor ( Fig . 3 ) . Vials that are broken and compromised are not used in experiments in order to maintain accurate particle concentrations and to limit the need for having to weigh out certain amounts of powder for experiments . Resuspending directly in the vial saves time and limits radiation exposure . These speciﬁc vials are specially cleaned to remove sodium and other trace element contamination . Wear gloves when handling the vials in order to limit contamination . Follow radiation safety procedures diligently and make sure everything is set up in a way that limits personal exposure to the radioac - tive materials . 15 . The sterile PBS is used in animal work and serum free media is used for cell work . Some of the powder may appear on the cap after irradiation and shipping . After carefully removing the cap to add the suspension media , make sure to carefully reattach the lid and shake the vial vigorously to try and recover the total mass of particles in the vial for accurate nanoparticle concentrations .

Paro , Ilanchezhian Shanmugam , and Anne L . van de Ven Abstract Metallic nanoparticles with a high atomic number release Auger electrons in response to external beam X - ray radiation . When these nanoparticles are selectively delivered to tumors , they have the potential to locally enhance the effects of radiation therapy . Optimizing the therapeutic efﬁcacy of these nanoparticles , however , remains a challenging and time - consuming task . Here we describe three different assays that can be used to experimentally quantify and optimize the in vitro therapeutic efﬁcacy of nanoparticle - mediated X - ray radiation enhancement . These include an IC50 extended dose response curve , clonogenic cell survival assay , and immunoblotting . Collectively , these assays provide information about whether a given nanoparticle provides radiosensitization , the extent of the radiosensitization , and the potential mechanism of radiosensitization . Key words Radiosensitization , Metallic nanoparticles , DNA damage , Clonogenic assay , IC50 , Immu - noblotting , Surviving fraction 1 Introduction Cancer continues to be a major public health problem in the USA , with 595 , 690 new deaths anticipated in 2016 , making it the second leading cause of death [ 1 ] . Radiation therapy , the use of ionizing radiation for cancer treatment , is currently administered to over half of all cancer patients to treat primary tumors , prevent recur - rence , or relieve symptoms caused by cancer [ 2 ] . Radiation therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy or surgery , and is often selected for its ability to slow tumor growth and control energy deposition over time [ 3 , 4 ] . Unfortunately , the use of high - intensity ionizing radiation poses signiﬁcant risks to surrounding healthy tissue [ 5 ] . Several techniques have been used to minimize the radiation dose delivered to normal cells while maximizing that delivered to cancer cells . These methods include fractionating the radiation dose Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 25 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 391 over time , so that cancer cells can enter a more radiosensitive phase in the cell cycle before re - treatment , or fractioning over space by intersecting the tumor with lower - dose beams from multiple direc - tions [ 6 ] . Other methods include systemic administration of radio - protective drugs to scavenge free radicals in healthy cells [ 7 ] , radiosensitizers to selectively increase radiosensitivity of tumor cells [ 8 ] , and metallic nanoparticles to locally enhance free radical production [ 9 ] . Designed to accumulate in tumors via the enhanced perme - ation and retention effect , metallic nanoparticles can selectively enhance the effect of X - rays in tumor cells via the localized release of Auger electrons ( Fig . 1 ) . Nanoparticles with a high atomic number absorb lower energy X - rays ( 30 keV – 1 MeV ) , resulting in the displacement of an inner shell electron and its subsequent replacement by the fall of an electron from a higher level . The energy released during ﬁlling of the ﬁrst electron vacancy can eject another electron from the atom , known as an Auger electron [ 9 ] . The released Auger electrons travel only very short distances , and thus tend to hydrolyze water molecules within the same cell , creat - ing free radicals that induce DNA damage [ 11 ] . When paired with X - ray induced damage , the combination of single - and double - stranded DNA breaks makes DNA repair and replication more difﬁcult , eventually resulting in cell death [ 10 ] . Several assays can be used to experimentally quantify and opti - mize the in vitro therapeutic efﬁcacy of nanoparticle - mediated X - ray radiation enhancement . The IC50 extended nanoparticle dose response curve is used to determine relative toxicity of nano - particles alone , in order to select a safe concentration range at NP H 2 O ROS X - Rays DNA Damage Cell Death e - e - e - e - Fig . 1 The proposed mechanism by which metallic nanoparticles enhance radiation sensitivity in cells . Auger electrons released from the nanoparticle following X - ray radiation result in hydrolysis of water molecules within the cell , producing free radicals that interact with DNA to cause large numbers of single - stranded DNA breaks and eventual cell death . Adapted from [ 10 ] 392 Autumn D . Paro et al . which nanoparticles can be administered for radiation enhance - ment . In this assay , cell monolayers are treated with different con - centrations of nanoparticles to identify the nanoparticle concentration that results in 50 % cell kill . Unlike conventional cytotoxicity studies , the IC50 assay described here is longer in duration in order to be sensitive to cell growth inhibition as a result of DNA damage [ 12 ] . The clonogenic cell survival assay is used to measure the fraction of surviving cells that retain proliferative capacity following X - ray irradiation [ 13 , 14 ] . In this assay , cells are pretreated with nanoparticles , subjected to X - ray irradiation , and then re - plated at low seeding densities to enable the counting of individual cell colonies . Immunoblotting , or western blotting , is used to identify changes in protein expression following treatment . In this assay , protein expression is sampled at different time - points following X - ray irradiation , both the in presence and absence of nanoparticles , in order to determine how pretreatment with nano - particles enhances radiation sensitivity [ 15 ] . Different primary anti - bodies can be selected based the putative mechanism of interest , such as DNA damage and repair , apoptosis , and ROS generation . Collectively , these assays provide information about whether a given nanoparticle provides radiosensitization , the extent of the radiosensitization , and the potential mechanism of radiosensitization . 2 Materials 2 . 1 Cell Culture Reagents for IC50 and Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay 1 .

Resuspend the nanoparticles of interest in a small volume of water or saline , and then sonicate or pipette to achieve a mono - disperse suspension . To determine the concentration of nano - particles that produces 50 % cell kill in the absence of radiation , nanoparticles are generally administered across the nM to mM dose range . Prepare several different dilutions of nanoparticles in complete media . Replace the cell supernant with 2 mL of cell culture medium with or without nanoparticles .

Remove formalin – crystal violet mixture with repeated washing using deionized water . Let the plates dry overnight . Example colonies of cells seeded at three different densities are shown in Fig . 2a . 6 . Once the plates are dry , individual colonies can be counted manually using pen and paper or ImageJ software . The plating efﬁciency , PE , is calculated as PE ¼ # colonies formed # cells seeded using the number of colonies counted in the untreated con - trols . The surviving fraction , SF , for each treatment group is calculated as SF ¼ # colonies formed # cells seeded (cid:4) PE Fig . 2 Colonies of Capan - 1 pancreatic cancer cells after 14 days of cell culture . ( a ) Cells were plated at a density of 2000 , 1500 , and 1000 cells / well ( left to right ) in 6 - well plates 4 h after irradiation . ( b ) Colony counting following different doses of radiation yield a dose - dependent survival curve 396 Autumn D . Paro et al . Once the survival fraction has been calculated for each dose , the survival curve can be plotted as shown in Fig . 2b . 3 . 2 Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay 1 . Seed cells ( 100 , 000 – 300 , 000 ) into T25 cell culture ﬂasks and add 3 mL of complete cell culture media . A minimum of two ﬂasks is needed for each radiation dose : one with nanoparticle treatment and one without . Typical radiation doses include : 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 Gy . Incubate ﬂasks at 37 (cid:1) C in 5 % CO 2 until they reach ~ 70 % conﬂuency , changing media as needed ( see Notes 1 and 2 ) . 2 . Resuspend the nanoparticles of interest in a small volume of water or saline , and then sonicate or pipette to achieve a mono - disperse suspension . Dilute the nanoparticle concentrate with a sufﬁcient volume of complete media in order to fully replace that in the T25 ﬂasks . Remove media from each T25 ﬂask , add 3 mL of diluted nanoparticles or untreated media , and return the cells to the incubator for at least 24 h ( see Note 3 ) . 3 . Twenty - four hours after nanoparticle treatment , irradiate the cells using a cabinet or small animal X - ray irradiator . For each radiation dose , you should have one plate treated with nano - particles , and one without . Be sure to also bring the non - irradiated cells to the X - ray irradiator in order to subject the control cells to the same environmental conditions as the trea - ted cells . After irradiation , return the cells to the incubator . 4 . Four hours after irradiation , harvest the cells for replating in 6 - well plates . One ﬂask at a time , remove media , wash with 1 mL PBS , incubate with 1 mL pre - warmed 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA for 3 min or until the cells have detached . Neutralize the trypsin with 2 – 3 mL complete media ( or media containing soybean trypsin inhibitor ) , pellet the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube , and resuspend cells in 2 – 3 mL media . Mix equal volumes of 0 . 4 % ( w / v ) trypan blue and cells , and count the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer . 5 . Seed the cells in triplicate in 6 - well plates . The appropriate seeding density is usually on the order of 100 – 10 , 000 cells per well . This seeding density is deliberately low so that cells with proliferative capacity will appear as distinct , non - overlapping colonies following 2 weeks of culture . It may be necessary to plate the irradiated and / or nanoparticle - treated cells at a higher density than the untreated controls . Once the appropriate seeding density is determined ( this may take several tries ) , dilute and seed the cells into 6 - well plates , with each well containing 3 mL media . Incubate the colonies for at least 2 weeks , changing media only if needed . Nanoparticle - Mediated Radiation Enhancement 397 6 . After sufﬁcient colonies have formed , label and count the cell colonies as described in steps 5 and 6 under Subheading 3 . 1 above . 3 . 3 Immunoblotting 1 . Prepare and treat cells seeded in 6 - well plates with nanoparti - cles and radiation as desired . At the appropriate time - point following irradiation ( as determined by the protein target of interest ) , prepare protein lysates as described in the Bio - Rad General Protocol for Western Blotting [ 21 ] . Generally , one conﬂuent well yields sufﬁcient protein for loading multiple gel lanes ; however , it is recommended to prepare at least three replicates of each treatment condition when running multiple gels . 2 . Determine the overall protein concentration of each cell lysate using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay . Protein lysates should be stored at (cid:3) 80 (cid:1) C . 3 . Preheat a hot plate to 100 (cid:1) C . Place the lysis buffer , Precision Plus protein standards , reducing agent , and protein lysate on ice . 4 . Prepare all reagents . The running , washing , and transfer buf - fers can be prepared in advance . The sample buffer and block - ing buffer should be prepared fresh each time . 5 . Place 1 – 4 gels on electrode assemblies , adding a buffer dam for odd numbers of gels . Fill the center of each electrode assembly with running buffer to verify the gasket is not leaking . Finish ﬁlling the buffer tank to the appropriate line , based on the number of gels being run . Using running buffer , wash each loading well by pipetting up and down several times ( see Notes 4 and 5 ) . 6 . Aliquot the protein lysate into microcentrifuge tubes and dilute to ½ the ﬁnal volume using with lysis buffer . Add 2 (cid:4) sample buffer , so that 50 % of the ﬁnal volume is sample buffer and 50 % is protein lysate in lysis buffer ( see Note 6 ) . 7 . Heat the protein samples at 100 (cid:1) C for 5 min , and then centrifuge at 3000 rcf for 1 min , to collect the sample at the bottom of the tube . 8 . Load each gel from left to right , placing 5 – 10 μ L of Precision Plus Protein standard into the ﬁrst well . Place the cover on the buffer tank and set the power supply to 150 V , 75 mA . Run the gel for desired amount of time to separate the protein band ( s ) of interest , generally 45 – 60 min , and then turn off power supply ( see Note 7 ) . 9 . To prepare for gel transfer , soak two transfer stacks per gel in transfer solution . Soak PVDF or nitrocellulose transfer mem - branes in 95 % ethanol for 3 min , followed by 3 min in transfer 398 Autumn D . Paro et al . solution . In the meantime , open each gel , and place them into the transfer solution . For an even transfer , it is recommended to remove the tops of gels using a knife to create a straight top edge . If multiple gels are used with different protein concen - trations , make note of which one is placed where for later reference when adding primary antibody . 10 . Place a transfer stack into the transfer cassette , followed by the transfer membrane , then the gel , and ﬁnally another transfer stack . Make sure there are no air bubbles beneath each layer as it is placed down . Complete the assembly of the transfer cas - sette and place it into the transfer system . Set the power supply to 25 V , 1 . 0 A for 30 min . These time and power settings may vary based on the transfer method used . 11 . When the transfer is ﬁnished , remove membranes from transfer cassette and place each into its own labeled plastic box . Add 15 mL of blocking buffer to each container and shake on an orbital shaker for 60 min to block non - speciﬁc binding ( see Notes 8 and 9 ) . 12 . Remove the blocking buffer and add the primary antibody . If you plan to run multiple antibodies per membrane , cut the membrane and separate the pieces into new containers . Pri - mary antibodies are diluted in blocking buffer as recom - mended by manufacturer . Place container in the fridge or on a refrigerated shaker overnight . 13 . The next day , place the membranes on a shaker at room tem - perature for 2 h . Remove primary antibody , and wash four times with 10 – 15 mL TBST at 10 - min intervals . Shake contin - uously ( see Note 10 ) . 14 . Remove the TBST and replace with 15 mL of secondary anti - body diluted in blocking buffer as per manufacturer’s instruc - tions . Make sure to use a secondary antibody that that is designed to bind the Fc domain of the primary antibody . For chemiluminescent detection , also add 1 μ L of Strep Tactin HRP conjugate . Shake at room temperature for 1 h . 15 . Remove the secondary antibody and wash four times with 10 – 15 mL TBST at 10 - min intervals . Shake continuously . 16 . Freshly prepare the chemiluminescent developer solution by combining Peroxide solution and Luminal Solution ( 1 : 1 ) from the Western ECL Substrate Kit . Prepare just enough to cover each membrane evenly . Remove one membrane at a time from the TBST , pat dry with a lint - free wipe , and place into devel - oper solution for 5 min while shaking gently . After developing , pat the membrane dry , and cover in cling wrap , removing as many bubbles as possible . Image using a chemiluminescent imager ( see Note 11 ) .

More informa - tion can be found in Sect . 30 . 13 of the online ImageJ User Guide [ 22 ] . 4 Notes 1 . As an alternative to T25 ﬂasks , cells can be seeded into 6 - well plates . 2 . Radiation doses are measured in Grey ( Gy ) , where 1 Gy ¼ 1 J / kg . The dose is calculated by the total exposure time multiplied by the energy of the X - ray beam . 3 . Dilutions are calculated using the equation : V np ¼ C want C stock (cid:4) V total , where C want is the concentration desired , C stock is the concentration of the stock nanoparticle solution , V total is the total volume to make , and V np is the volume of nanoparticle stock needed . 4 . Make sure to remove tape from bottom of gel before placing in the gel box . Make sure when placing electrode assemblies into the buffer tank , the correct electrodes are on the correct side . 5 . When selecting or casting a gel , the size of the loading wells should be selected based on volume of protein to be loaded and the number of samples . Typically , as the well size increases , the number of available wells decreases . 6 . The amount of protein prepared for a given gel is dependent on the concentration of the target protein and is generally deter - mined experimentally when optimizing the use of each antibody . 7 . For proteins of low molecular weight , a shorter running time is needed . If left too long proteins , will run off the bottom of the gel . For proteins of high molecular weight , or when using one membrane to sample multiple proteins , a longer running time is generally needed to separate the bands of interest . 8 . In addition to labeling the protein loading concentration , it is helpful to record the primary antibody , antibody dilution , and the secondary antibody to be used . 9 . This blocking step can also be performed using non - fat dry milk instead of BSA . 10 . The primary antibody dilution can be saved and reused several times if stored at (cid:3) 20 (cid:1) C . 11 . For imaging , choose a standard exposure to start and then increase or decrease the exposure time based on the initial image . Take several images to verify that you have a good blot . 400 Autumn D .

Accessed 19 Dec 2015 Nanoparticle - Mediated Radiation Enhancement 401 Chapter 26 Radiosensitizing Silica Nanoparticles Encapsulating Docetaxel for Treatment of Prostate Cancer Jodi Belz , Noelle Castilla - Ojo , Srinivas Sridhar , and Rajiv Kumar Abstract The applications of nanoparticles in oncology include enhanced drug delivery , efﬁcient tumor targeting , treatment monitoring , and diagnostics . The “theranostic properties” associated with nanoparticles have shown enhanced delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs with superior imaging capabilities and minimal toxicities . In conventional chemotherapy , only a fraction of the administered drug reaches the tumor site or cancer cells . For successful translation of these formulations , it is imperative to evaluate the design and properties of these nanoparticles . Here , we describe the design of ultra - small silica nanoparticles to encapsulate a radiosensitizing drug for combined chemoradiation therapy . The small size of nanoparticles allows for better dispersion and uptake of the drug within the highly vascularized tumor tissue . Silica nanoparticles are synthesized using an oil - in - water microemulsion method . The microemulsion method provides a robust synthetic route in which the inner hydrophobic core is used to encapsulate chemotherapy drug , docetaxel while the outer hydrophilic region provides dispersibility of the synthesized nanoparticles in an aqueous environment . Docetaxel is commonly used for treatment of resistant or metastatic prostate cancer , and is known to have radiosensitizing properties . Here , we describe a systematic approach for synthesizing these theranostic nanoparticles for application in prostate cancer . Key words Silica nanoparticles , Docetaxel , Drug delivery , Microemulsions , Prostate cancer , Bottom - up synthesis , Radiosensitization 1 Introduction While chemotherapy is frequently used as a ﬁrst line of treatment , adverse toxicities and low bioavailability associated with the non - speciﬁc systemic drugs often limit treatment timing and dosing in patients [ 1 ] . To overcome these toxicities and improve circulation time , many researchers are using nanoparticles as a means for delivery [ 2 , 3 ] . Since radiation therapy is used in more than 50 % of the cancer patients , the development of nanoparticles formula - tions which can combine the two monotherapies , chemotherapy and radiation , will not only boost the therapeutic efﬁcacy but also reduce the toxicities associated with monotherapies [ 4 ] . Currently , docetaxel is given systemically as Taxotere to patients via Reema Zeineldin ( ed . ) , Cancer Nanotechnology : Methods and Protocols , Methods in Molecular Biology , vol . 1530 , DOI 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 4939 - 6646 - 2 _ 26 , © Springer Science + Business Media New York 2017 403 intravenous infusion once every 2 – 3 weeks to allow for recovery . Docetaxel is non - cell speciﬁc and acts on the microtubules of cells , preventing depolymerization . This traps the cell in G2 / M phase , which also results in increased radiosensitizing properties [ 5 ] . As a result , co - delivery of docetaxel with radiation treatment can prove to be an effective dual treatment in the case of certain cancers . It is believed that this radiosensitization effect can lead to the use of lower doses to achieve synergistic therapeutic effects , while reduc - ing the overall toxicity experienced during the treatment . Here , we propose the use of PEGylated ( i . e . , polyethylene glycol - functiona - lized ) ultra - small silica nanoparticles to encapsulate docetaxel for combined chemoradiation therapy . We describe a systematic protocol for synthesis of silica nano - particles to encapsulate the hydrophobic drug in the core of nano - particles . Silica nanoparticles can be formulated at various sizes , ranging from 10 to 250 nm in diameter [ 6 , 7 ] . The core is nonpolar and can trap a variety of hydrophobic chemotherapeutics , small molecules , or dyes . The surface of the nanoparticles is modiﬁed with PEG and / or targeting ligands for long term circulation and targeted cellular uptake . The PEGylation of nanoparticles mini - mizes the opsonization process and allows for increased systemic circulation [ 8 ] . The functional groups on the surface of the nano - particles can be used for conjugating targeting molecules like pep - tides , antibodies or aptamers [ 9 ] . Below , we describe the formulation of docetaxel - loaded ultra - small silica nanoparticles for radiosensitization in prostate cancer . We conjugate a near - infrared ﬂuorophore , Cyanine 7 . 5 , to the silica nanoparticles to track the nanoparticle in vitro and in vivo . First we describe the fabrication and puriﬁcation of the nanoparticles , followed by characterization and quantiﬁcation of drug loaded silica nanoparticles using various instrumentation techniques . 2 Materials 1 .

Degas 1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) using argon to remove oxygen ( ~ 1 min ) and add 1 mL of DMSO to 5 mg of Cy7 . 5 NHS ester to make 5 mg / mL concentration . 2 . Add 20 μ L of APTES to the dye solution ( the color should now have a slight yellow tint ) followed by addition of 20 μ L of trimethylamine . 3 . Add a small stir bar for stirring the reaction mixture gently and put a septum on the reaction vial . Purge the reaction mixture with argon gas overnight . 4 . The ﬁnal product , Cy 7 . 5 conjugated to APTES via the amine groups of APTES can be used without further puriﬁcation . When added to the nanoparticles , the conjugate will polymer - ize along with VTES to form ﬂuorescent nanoparticles ( see Note 2 ) . 3 . 2 Synthesis of Silica Nanoparticles 1 . Prepare 2 . 2 % ( w / v ) AOT solution in deionized water ( see Note 3 ) . Weigh 220 mg of the surfactant AOT in a scintillation vial and add 10 mL of deionized water . To ensure accuracy in measurement and quick solvation , break AOT wax into small pieces before weighing . 2 . Place a stir - bar in scintillation vial and stir on a magnetic stirrer at approximately 1200 rpm ( see Note 4 ) . The solution will be become cloudy in appearance as the AOT dissolves . 3 . After 15 – 20 min of stirring , add 300 μ L of 1 - butanol ( see Note 4 ) . The solution should become clear upon addition . 4 . After 5 min , add 75 μ L of docetaxel ( 10 mg / mL in DMSO ) and 50 μ L modiﬁed Cy7 . 5 ( 5 mg / mL in DMSO ) ( see Note 5 ) . Reaction mixture should be protected from light to avoid photo - bleaching using aluminum foil . 5 . After 5 min of stirring , add 100 μ L of silane precursor , vinyl - triethoxysilane ( VTES ) . 6 . Stir the reaction mixture for 40 min and thereafter add 10 μ L of ammonium hydroxide ( see Note 6 ) . Radiosensitizing Silica Nanoparticles 405 7 . For PEGylation of the nanoparticles , add 10 μ L 2 - [ methoxy ( polyethyleneoxy ) 6 - 9propyl ] trimethoxysilane 10 min after the addition of ammonium hydroxide . 8 . Stir the solution overnight , or for at least 12 h to allow nano - particle formation and Ostwald ripening ( see Note 7 ) . 9 . Remove stir bar and store the nanoparticles at 4 (cid:1) C if not immediately dialyzed . 3 . 3 Dialysis The purpose of dialysis is to remove the surfactant , excess of reac - tants and any unencapsulated drug / ﬂuorophore molecules from the nanoparticles solution . 1 . Cut the dialysis tubing to approximately 5 in . and prepare the tubing as per manufacturer’s recommended protocols . 2 . Pipette as prepared nanoparticles solution into dialysis tubing while securing the end of the tubes with the dialysis clips . 3 . Put the dialysis tubing with sample in a container with 4 L of deionized water . 4 . Stir water at roughly 100 rpm . Caution : ensure that the dialysis tubing is stirring slowly and if required adjust speed accordingly . 5 . Change deionized water ( DI ) every 30 min for 2 h , then again after 8 h . Change again at 24 and 36 h ( see Note 8 ) . 6 . Remove the sample after 48 h of dialysis against DI water ( see Note 9 ) . 3 . 4 Preparation for High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) Analysis Sonicate dialyzed nanoparticle solution for 1 min to allow for even dispersion of particles . 1 . Pipette out 250 μ L of the nanoparticles solution into a micro - centrifuge tube . All samples must be taken in triplicate to ensure accuracy . 2 . Add 250 μ L of dichloromethane and 250 μ L HPLC grade methanol to the tube . 3 . Sonicate for 45 min . 4 . Leave microcentrifuge tubes in fridge at 4 (cid:1) C overnight . 5 . Vortex for 10 s , then evaporate off the remaining dichloro - methane with air . 6 . Remove solution and transfer to spin ﬁlter centrifuge tubes . Centrifuge the tubes for 30 min at 16 , 128 rcf using a 100 mm rotor . 7 . Remove ﬁltrate from tubes and transfer to HPLC vials . 8 . Add 250 μ L of mobile phase ( 65 : 35 methanol in HPLC Water ) and vortex brieﬂy . 9 . Run HPLC via standard protocol ( see Note 10 ) . 406 Jodi Belz et al . 3 . 5 Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS ) 1 . Sonicate dialyzed nanoparticle solution for 1 min to allow for even dispersion of particles . 2 . Place 1 mL of nanoparticles to clear 2 mL cuvette . Dilute if necessary . 3 . Using 90Plus zeta sizer ( Brookhaven ) instrument perform measurements to determine hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles ( see Note 11 ) . 3 . 6 Transmission Electron Microscopy 1 . Sonicate dialyzed nanoparticle solution for 1 min to allow for even dispersion of particles . 2 . The TEM grids were prepared by drop casting the sample ( 20 μ L ) dispersion onto an amorphous carbon coated 300 mesh copper grid . 3 . Place copper grid on a ﬁlter paper to absorb the excess solvent and allow to dry before loading into chamber for TEM analysis using JEOL model JEM - 100CX microscope at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV ( see Note 12 ) . 4 Notes 1 . We have used a hydrophobic drug docetaxel to encapsulate inside silica nanoparticles . Similar synthetic strategies can be adopted to encapsulate other hydrophobic drugs . 2 . The conjugation of Cy 7 . 5 to nanoparticles gives a purple color solution which can be due to the aggregation of dye molecules in the silica matrix whereas when the same ﬂuorophore Cy 7 . 5 is encapsulated it gives a typical green color . 3 . The surfactant AOT along with co - surfactant 1 - butanol and DMSO when mixed together will create an oil - in - water micro - emulsion system . A surfactant like AOT highly reduces the interfacial tension at the water / oil interface . In this formula - tion , water is the bulk phase of the microemulsion , whereas DMSO forms the oil phase in the form nanosize droplets / reactors . The hydrophobic drugs / ﬂuorophores will reside inside these droplets and exchange between the two microe - mulsion droplets will result in hydrolysis and polymerization of silane precursors ( in basic pH ) inside these nanosize droplets . This leads to entrapment of hydrophobic molecules in the silica matrix . Reverse micellar approach using a water - in - oil micro - emulsion system can also be used to synthesize silica nanopar - ticles . In such an instance , the polar groups are directed into the aqueous core , formulating nanoparticles which will entrap polar drugs / ﬂuorophores [ 10 , 11 ] . Radiosensitizing Silica Nanoparticles 407 4 . The size of the particles can be modulated by many variables including stirring speed of the reaction mixture . The amount of butanol ( the oil phase ) is a major factor in modulating the particle size . Addition of more butanol will increase the size of the nanoparticles . e . g . , for synthesizing 200 nm silica , add 700 μ L butanol to the AOT mixture , and for 30 nm silica add 300 μ L butanol . 5 . Docetaxel and Cy7 . 5 can be substituted by other hydrophobic drugs or dye . The quantity was determined by our loading efﬁciency of the drug . The HPLC protocol and mobile phase must be selected accordingly if the drug of choice is not Docetaxel . 6 . Addition of ammonium hydroxide results in hydrolysis and polycondensation of vinyltriethoxysilane to vinylpolysiloxane inside the micellar core which leads to formation of small size nanoparticles . 7 . Drug / dye encapsulated nanoparticles prepared as above will maintain a translucent appearance and be approximately 30 nm in size . The size of the particles can be checked with dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) and further conﬁrmed with transmission electron microscopy ( 30 nm ) . 8 . Dialysis must be done for 48 h with at least six water changes to ensure removal of excess reagents especially AOT which have known toxicities in both in vitro and in vivo systems . 9 . Store nanoparticles in fridge at 4 (cid:1) C . It is best to use a new batch of nanoparticles for experiments to limit the amount of drug / dye released from the particles . 10 . Dispose of all waste for HPLC and after preparation according to hazardous waste management protocols . 11 . Dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) measurements were per - formed by using 90Plus zeta sizer ( Brookhaven Inc , NY ) . Zeta potential measurements can be acquired with the same instrument . 12 . Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ) images were obtained using a JEOL model JEM - 100CX microscope at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV .
