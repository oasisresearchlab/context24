Kurzchalia 1 1 Department of Cell Biology , Max Delbrück Centre for Molecular Medicine , Robert - Rössle - Strasse 10 , 13125 Berlin - Buch , Germany ABSTRACT | There is some discussion as to whether glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins occur in microdomains in the cell membrane . These putative microdomains have been implicated in processes such as sorting in polarized cells and signal transduction . Complexes enriched in GPI - anchored proteins , cholesterol and glycosphingolipids have been isolated from cell membranes by using non - ionic detergents : these complexes were thought to represent a clustered arrangement of GPI - anchored proteins . However , results obtained when clustering of GPI - anchored proteins induced by antibodies or by detergents was prevented support the idea of a dispersed surface distribution of GPI - anchored proteins at steady state . Here we use chemical crosslinking to show that membrane microdomains of a GPI - anchored protein exist at the surface in living cells . This clustering is specific for the GPI - anchored form , as two transmembrane forms bearing the same ectodomain do not form oligomers . Depletion of membrane cholesterol causes the clustering of GPI - anchored proteins to break up , whereas treatment of cells with detergent substantially increases the size of the complexes . We find that in living cells these GPI - anchored proteins reside in microdomains consisting of at least 15 molecules , which are much smaller than those seen after detergent extraction . To study the association of GPI - anchored proteins on the cell surface of intact cells , we used growth hormone ( GH ) with the GPI - anchoring signal from decay - accelerating factor ( DAF ) attached to its carboxy terminus ( GH - DAF ) ( Fig . 1a ) . This molecule is an established model for a GPI - anchored protein [ 14 ] . When MDCK cells that permanently express GH - DAF ( MDCK GH - DAF ) were chemically crosslinked at 4 °C with the membrane - impermeable agent bis ( sulphosuccinimidyl ) suberate ( BS3 ) , a prominent band corresponding to a relative molecular mass of 46K ( dimer ) , and a smear from ≈ 60K to ≈ 300K were detected , suggesting the existence of microdomains . The crosslinking efficiency for 0 . 5 mM BS3 was 71 % . When crosslinked at 37 °C , the pattern was similar ( crosslinking efficiency was 86 % ) , indicating that microdomains also exist at physiological temperatures . Increasing concentrations of BS3 ( 4 °C ) or increasing the incubation time with crosslinker ( 37 °C ) shifted the pattern of crosslinked products to high - molecular - mass forms ( Fig . 1b ) . To analyse the oligomers formed , we used the cleavable BS3 analogue 3 , 3 ' - dithiobis - ( sulphosuccinimidylpropionate ) ( DTSSP ) and two - dimensional ( 2D ) electrophoresis . Electrophoresis in the first dimension gave a crosslinking pattern similar to that obtained with BS3 , whereas the second dimension under reducing conditions revealed that the crosslinked oligomers consisted primarily of GH - DAF ( arrow in Fig . 1c ) ; some minor interaction partners were also detected ( arrowheads in Fig . 1c ) . Because the length of the spacer arm of BS3 is only 1 . 14 nm , the detection of crosslinked GH - DAF oligomers indicates that these molecules are close together on the cell surface at steady state . We estimate that the domains consist of at least 15 GH - DAF molecules , because the largest crosslinked species corresponds to a multimer of 15 GH - DAF species . However , the number of GH - DAF molecules in a cluster cannot be defined precisely with this approach : the number is likely to be an underestimate owing to non - saturated crosslinking . If GH - DAF molecules are crosslinked just because of their relatively high density in cell membranes , there should be a significant difference in crosslinking efficiency in high - and low - expressing clones ; but if GH - DAF is confined to microdomains , there should be a high local concentration of molecules and the extent of crosslinking efficiencies should be independent of the amount of expression . We therefore isolated MDCK clones expressing different amounts of GH - DAF ( clones 10 and 16 express 5 - and 20 - fold more than clone 3 , respectively ) and used them for crosslinking ( Fig . 1d ) . Quantification of the bands on the blot revealed that the crosslinking efficiency was comparable in all clones ( 86 , 81 and 78 % for clones 3 , 10 and 16 , respectively ) , irrespective of the amount of GH - DAF expressed ( Fig . 1d ) . To compare crosslinking patterns , we used the ratio of high - molecular - mass ( top third of crosslinked species ) to total crosslinked species . These ratios were 30 , 23 and 25 % for clones 3 , 10 and 16 , respectively . For all three clones , crosslinking occurred even when the reaction time was very short ( 2 or 5 min ; data not shown ) , confirming that the GPI - anchored protein was present in domains with a high local concentration . To investigate whether clustering is specific for GH - DAF , cell lines bearing a transmembrane form of growth hormone were generated : MDCK GH - FL ( growth hormone fused to the transmembrane domain of the FcRII - B2 receptor and the cytosolic domain of the low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor ; Fig . 1a ) and MDCK GH - FL3YA ( in which three cytosolic tyrosine residues have been mutated to alanine ) . Cells expressing comparable amounts of protein ( MDCK GH - FL and GH - FL3YA cells express 73 and 76 % of the amount of protein expressed in GH - DAF cl . 10 cells , respectively ) were crosslinked with BS3 . In contrast to GH - DAF , the amount of GH - FL and GH - FL3YA monomers remaining after crosslinking was unchanged and no oligomers were formed ( Fig . 1e ) ; the secretory form of GH would not crosslink under a variety of conditions ( Fig . 1e , and data not shown ) . Together , these findings indicate that the propensity of GH - DAF to cluster is due to its GPI anchor and not to its protein moiety . Note that GH - DAF and GH - FL3YA are both expressed apically in polarized MDCK cells ( data not shown ) , indicating that microclustering and apical sorting in epithelial cells may not be connected . Is the clustered organization at the plasma membrane a Friedrichson T and Kurzchalia T MDC Repository | http : / / edoc . mdc - berlin . de / 3813 / 2 general property of GPI - anchored proteins ? When other cells ( CHO ) that permanently express another GPI - anchored protein ( the folate receptor , CHO FR - GPI ) were crosslinked with BS3 , the pattern of crosslinked products was similar to that obtained with MDCK GH - DAF ( dimers , trimers and so on ) ( Fig . 2b ) . Although the existence of GPI - anchored protein clusters in the plasma membrane of living cells is unproven [ 2 , 15 ] , cholesterol depletion leads to a loss of antibody - induced clustering of GPI - anchored proteins [ 16 ] , an increase in their detergent solubility [ 17 , 18 ] , inhibition of folate uptake [ 19 , 20 ] and of signal transduction by GPI - anchored proteins [ 21 ] . To see whether cholesterol depletion affected microclustering of GH - DAF and FR - GPI , we treated MDCK GH - DAF cells with methyl - β - cyclodextrin [ 22 ] and found that the cellular cholesterol content was reduced to 37 % of that of control cells , causing the crosslinking of GH - DAF to be inhibited ( Fig . 2a ) and the efficiency to be reduced to 14 % ; also , the clustering of FR - GPI in CHO FR - GPI cells was almost abolished after extraction of cholesterol ( Fig . 2b ) . Results were the same , irrespective of the cholesterol - depletion protocol . Replenishing cholesterol - depleted MDCK GH - DAF cells with cholesterol increased their cholesterol content to 78 % and partly restored crosslinking ( crosslinking efficiency increased to 25 % ; Fig . 2a ) . These results indicate that cholesterol - dependent clustering of GH - DAF is partially reversible and in principle could be modulated in the cell , and that the dependence of the integrity of the GPI - anchored protein cluster on cholesterol seems to be a general phenomenon not confined to particular cell types . The identification of the lectin - like membrane protein VIP36 in detergent - insoluble complexes [ 23 ] and of N - glycans as possible sorting signals for secreted proteins in MDCK cells [ 24 ] has raised the question of whether carbohydrate moieties are involved in transport and / or sorting of GPI - anchored protein . As the GPI anchor consists of both lipid and carbohydrate , we investigated whether carbohydrates are needed to maintain oligomers by crosslinking MDCK GH - DAF and CHO FR - GPI cells in the presence of different monosaccharides ( glucose , mannose , inositol and N - acetylglucosamine ) , assuming that excess structural carbohydrates from the GPI anchor might interfere with crosslinking . N - acetylglucosamine was used instead of glucosamine , which contains a reactive amino group that would prevent crosslinking . In contrast to the results from cholesterol - depletion experiments , we detected no changes in the pattern of crosslinked products ( data not shown ) . When the cell membrane is extracted with non - ionic detergents , a fraction enriched in cholesterol , glycosphingolipids and GPI - anchored proteins can be isolated [ 1 , 4 , 10 ] , forming a basis for arguments for the existence of rafts [ 1 ] . Others , however , claim that GPI - anchored proteins aggregate only after addition of detergents or antibodies [ 12 , 13 , 15 , 25 ] . We investigated the connection between our crosslinked oligomers and the clusters found after detergent extraction of cells by crosslinking MDCK GH - DAF cells after extraction with Triton - X - 114 detergent using mild or harsh conditions ( see Methods ; the latter is commonly used for preparing detergent - insoluble complexes ) . Mild TX - 114 extraction leads to a shift to high - molecular - weight crosslinked products ( Fig . 3a ) ; this shift is more evident in samples subjected to harsh TX - 114 extraction : complexes are so large that only a small fraction ( 10 % ) can enter the gel ( Fig . 3b , top ) . Upon cleavage of the crosslinker DTSSP with a reducing agent , 95 % of the material is recovered ( Fig . 3b , bottom ) . These results indicate that the crosslinked clusters of GH - DAF are significantly smaller than the clusters induced by Triton X - 114 treatment : this could be due to the merging of small microdomains [ 4 ] . According to the hypothesis of Simons and Ikonen [ 1 ] , glycosphingolipids and cholesterol can form platforms ( rafts ) with which some proteins , such as GPI - anchored proteins , are closely associated and from which other membrane proteins are excluded ; however , the existence of rafts in living cells , particularly of any containing GPI - anchored proteins , has not been demonstrated . Clustering of GPI - anchored proteins may have been overestimated or small clusters may have escaped detection because of limitations of the microscopical methods used [ 12 ] . The results from a fluorescence resonance energy - transfer technique [ 26 ] together with those presented here , to our knowledge provide the first evidence for the existence of rafts in vivo : we conclude the GPI - anchored proteins reside in membrane microdomains which need cholesterol to be maintained , and that these proteins become heavily aggregated after detergent extraction . We shall not know the exact size or the protein and lipid composition of the rafts until new methods can be devised to isolate rafts without using detergents . This isolation will be difficult because rafts are probably dynamic structures that are constantly exchanging their components [ 27 ] . For instance , the discovery of caveolin - 1 , a protein of the caveolar coat , in detergent extracts enriched in glycosphingolipids , cholesterol and GPI - anchored proteins has led to the proposed existence of rafts containing caveolin - 1 and GPI - anchored proteins [ 10 ] . However , there is accumulating evidence that there is no enrichment of GPI - anchored proteins in caveolae [ 25 , 28 , 29 ] ; the same is true for trimeric G proteins , which are also found in a buoyant raft fraction but are neither functionally nor morphologically connected with caveolin [ 30 ] . The rules governing the interplay between the inclusion and exclusion of proteins into rafts remain to be defined . Methods Cloning PCR cloning techniques were used to replace the stop codon of rat growth hormone with a Bam HI site creating pSP64GH Δ C . The same site was added upstream of the GPI - anchoring signal from DAF and cloned into pSP64GH Δ C to yield pSP64GH - DAF . Plasmid pCBFL5 - 50 encodes the FcRII - B2 receptor ecto - and transmembrane domains fused to the LDL - receptor cytosolic domain [ 31 ] . In pCBFL5 - 503YA , the three cytosolic tyrosine residues are mutated to alanine . PCR was used to add Bam HI sites upstream of the transmembrane sequences , and fragments were cloned in pSP64GH Δ C to create pSP64GH - FL and pSP64GH - FL3YA , respectively . All constructs were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pRc / CMV ( Invitrogen ) . Cells , cell culture and transfection MDCK cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS and antibiotics . CHO FR - GPI cells were maintained in folate - free Hams F - 12 medium containing 5 % FCS , antibiotics and 100 μ g ml - 1 hygromycin .

Crosslinking , electrophoresis and western blotting Cells were washed twice with ice - cold PBS and chilled on ice . BS3 or DTSSP were diluted from 25 mM stocks to 0 . 5 mM with PBS unless indicated otherwise . Except where noted , crosslinking was quenched after 45 min by addition of 50 mM glycine for 15 min . All incubations were at 4 °C . MDCK GH - DAF cells ( clone 16 , except where noted ) were washed with PBS and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C and 10 min at 37 °C in TX - 114 lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl ; 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ; 1 mM EDTA ; 1 % Triton X - 114 , and protease inhibitors ) .

Aqueous and detergent phases were separated by centrifugation for 3 min at 13 , 000 r . p . m . at room temperature . To the detergent phases , 0 . 9 ml Triton X - 114 wash buffer ( 0 . 06 % TX - 114 , otherwise as TX - 114 lysis buffer ) was added and vortexed before centrifugation for 15 min at 15 , 000 g ( at 4 °C ) and another round of phase separation . Detergent phases were precipitated with cold acetone ( - 20 °C ) and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer . MDCK GH - FL and GH - FL3YA cells were crosslinked and lysed in TX - 114 lysis buffer for 30 min on ice . Cells were scraped and passed three times through a 26 - gauge needle to shear the DNA . After 15 min centrifugation at 15 , 000 g at 4 °C , soluble fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) . MDCK GH cells were incubated for 2 h with PBS containing 0 . 9 mM Ca 2 + and 0 . 5 mM Mg 2 + ( PBS ( + ) ) and BS3 was added to 0 . 5 mM directly from a 25 mM stock . Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with TCA . Pellets were washed with acetone and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer . Samples were resolved on 5 – 15 % SDS – PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose and detected with polyclonal antibodies against GH or folate receptor , HRP - labelled secondary antibodies and ECL . For 2D PAGE , MDCK GH - DAF cells were labelled for 12 h with 80 μ Ci 35 S - methionine ( NEN ) and crosslinked with DTSSP . The precipitated detergent phase was boiled in non - reducing sample buffer and resolved on 5 – 15 % SDS – PAGE ( 1D ) . The lane was cut and boiled in sample buffer containing 5 % β - mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 95 °C and then run on a 5 – 15 % gel ( 2D ) and autoradiographed . Cholesterol depletion and detergent treatments Cells were depleted of membrane cholesterol with 10 mM methyl - β - cyclodextrin in PBS ( + ) for 1 h at 37 °C . Replenishing with cholesterol was for 6 h at 37 °C with DMEM containing 10 % FCS . Cellular cholesterol was measured with an enzyme test kit ( Boehringer Mannheim ) . Protein was determined using a BCA protein assay kit ( Pierce ) . Detergent extractions were done as follows . After washing cells twice with PBS and chilling on ice , samples subjected to mild TX - 114 treatment were extracted for 5 min at RT with 0 . 5 % TX - 114 in PBS , washed with PBS twice and crosslinked .
