Phosphoinositides in cell regulation and membrane dynamics Gilbert Di Paolo 1 & Pietro De Camilli 2 Inositol phospholipids have long been known to have an important regulatory role in cell physiology . The repertoire of cellular processes known to be directly or indirectly controlled by this class of lipids has now dramatically expanded . Through interactions mediated by their headgroups , which can be reversibly phosphorylated to generate seven species , phosphoinositides play a fundamental part in controlling membrane – cytosol interfaces . These lipids mediate acute responses , but also act as constitutive signals that help deﬁne organelle identity . Their functions , besides classical signal transduction at the cell surface , include regulation of membrane trafﬁc , the cytoskeleton , nuclear events and the permeability and transport functions of membranes . I n the early 1950s , Hokin and Hokin ﬁrst observed changes in the turnover of membrane phospholipids on stimulation of exocrine tissues . This so - called ‘phospholipid effect’ was subsequently detected in a variety of tissues and attributed to changes in the turnover of phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) and its phosphorylated products , called phosphoinositides 1 . Studies in this area eventually focused on the function of phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) in signal transduction as a precursor of intracellular messengers generated by phospholipases 2 . Unexpected twists came fromthediscoveryof directsignallingrolesforPtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( refs3 – 5 ) and of phosphoinositides phosphorylated at the 3 position 6 – 8 . Furthermore , genetic screens in yeast and studies in evolutionarily higher eukaryotic cells demonstrated the involvement of phosphoino - sitide - metabolizing enzymes in membrane trafﬁc as well as cytoskele - ton organization 9 – 12 . The discovery and functional characterization of other rare phosphoinositides 13 , 14 , phosphoinositide - binding protein modules 15 , 16 and a plethora of phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes 17 – 19 have now dramatically advanced this ﬁeld . Phospho - inositides have been implicated in nearly all aspects of cell physiology . The importance of the signalling and constitutive functions of phosphoinositides is paralleled by that of soluble inositol polyphos - phates ( InsPs ) . In addition to the fundamental role of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in intracellular Ca 2 þ signalling 2 , many functions have been described for other InsPs , including gene transcription , RNA editing , nuclear export and protein phosphorylation . Although InsPs and phospho - inositides are metabolically and functionally interconnected , this review will focus selectively on the role of phosphoinositides . Metabolism and spatial distribution of phosphoinositides Inositol phospholipids are concentrated at the cytosolic surface of membranes . PtdIns , the precursor of phosphoinositides , is synthe - sized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and is then delivered to other membranes either by vesicular transport or via cytosolic PtdIns transfer proteins . Reversible phosphorylation of its inositol ring at positions 3 , 4 and 5 results in the generation of seven phosphoinositide species ( Fig . 1a ) . PtdIns typically represents less than 15 % of the total phospholipids found in eukaryotic cells and phosphoinositides are generally less abundant by one order of magnitude , with PtdIns ( 4 ) P and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 representing the bulk of these lipids in mammalian cells . Each of the seven phospho - inositides has a unique subcellular distribution with a predominant localization in subsets of membranes ( Fig . 1b , c ; see below ) . Further - more , within a given membrane , the localization of speciﬁc phospho - inositides can be heterogeneous . Pools of phosphoinositides have also been reported in the nucleus 20 . The differential intracellular distribution of phosphoinositides , together with their high turnover , makes these lipids optimal mediators of signalling events in all cellular compartments . Control of the membrane – cytosol interface Phosphoinositides achieve direct signalling effects through the bind - ing of their head groups to cytosolic proteins or cytosolic domains of membrane proteins . Thus , they can regulate the function of integral membrane proteins , or recruit to the membrane cytoskeletal and signalling components . This action is reminiscent of that of phosphotyrosine residues of membrane proteins , which mediate the recruitment of phosphotyrosine - binding modules ( for example , SH2 domains ) . Typically , binding of proteins to phosphoinositides involves electrostatic interactions with the negative charges of the phosphate ( s ) on the inositol ring . In some cases , adjacent hydro - phobic amino acids strengthen the interaction through a partial penetration into the bilayer 15 , 16 . Protein surfaces that interact with phosphoinositides can consist either of clusters of basic residues within unstructured regions , such as those found in many actin regulatory proteins ( for example , proﬁlin ) 5 , or of folded modules , such as the pleckstrin homology domain ( Fig . 1d and see below ) 15 , 16 , 21 . The distinction between these two types of interaction can be blurred . Furthermore , unstructured peptides can undergo folding on binding to phosphoinositide head groups . The number of phosphoinositide - binding modules is rapidly expanding ( Fig . 1d ) and their differential properties greatly amplify the signalling potential of phosphoinositides 15 , 16 , 21 . Coincidence detection code and organelle identity Generally , the interaction between phosphoinositides and cytosolic proteins is of low afﬁnity . Higher afﬁnity , and thus more stable , membrane – protein interactions are produced when phospho - inositides cooperate with one or more additional binding sites within REVIEWS 1 Department of Pathology and Cell Biology , The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer’s Disease and the Aging Brain , Columbia University Medical Center , New York , New York 10032 , USA . 2 Departments of Cell Biology and Neurobiology , Program in Cellular Neuroscience , Neurodegeneration and Repair , Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Kavli Institute for Neuroscience , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , Connecticut 06510 , USA .

Owing to the heterogeneous subcellular localization of phosphoinositides , this dual ( or multiple ) key - based recognition mechanism generates a powerful coincidence detection code for the regulation of membrane – cytosol interactions and thus for the deﬁ - nition of organelle identity ( Fig . 2a ) 22 , 23 . For example , although the clathrinadaptorsAP - 1andAP - 2 bindsomeof thesamecargoproteins , they are recruited to the Golgi complex or the plasma membrane , respectively , at least in part owing to the different phosphoinositide content of these membranes ( Fig . 2b ) 24 – 27 . One advantage of this dual code is that each component of the code can be independently regulated ( for example , by lipid enzyme activation or co - receptor phosphorylation ) , thus offering an opportunity for signal integration . The spatial restriction and steady - state levels of speciﬁc phospho - inositides are determined primarily by the concerted action of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases , whose localization is tightly controlled . Phosphoinositide segregation on different mem - branes helps ensure vectorial membrane trafﬁc , which is critical to achieve transport of cargo from one compartment to another . For example , a carrier vesicle must harbour a lipid composition that promotes the recruitment to its surface of factors needed for fusion with its acceptor membrane ( Fig . 2c ) . This state must be maintained until fusion has occurred and terminated thereafter . Conversely , the acceptor membrane must have properties that make it suitable as a partner for fusion and as a template for the recruitment of budding factors needed for the next trafﬁcking step . After budding , these factors ( generally coat proteins ) must be shed . Modiﬁcations in phosphoinositide environment after fusion ( by a dilution effect and exposure to a different enzymatic context ) and then after budding ( for example , by the selective recruitment of a phospho - inositide phosphatase onto the vesicle ) can efﬁciently account for these global changes because a new phosphoinositide would generate a new identity code ( Fig . 2c ) . A phosphoinositide - based code represents a very effective way to deﬁne organelle identity . Phospholipids can rapidly diffuse within , but not between , membranes ( unless assisted by transfer proteins ) . In addition , phosphoinositides can be rapidly interconverted from one species to another by strategically localized kinases and phosphatases as a membrane carrier translocates from one compartment to the next ( Figs 1c and 2c ) . Several enzymes contain modules that bind the substrate phosphoinositide ( Fig . 1d ) , thus facilitating recruitment of enzymes to the appropriate membrane and their retention at this membrane for catalysis as long as substrates to be consumed are present . Cooperation with small GTPases Another class of molecules that mediate or enable the recruitment of cytosolic proteins to speciﬁc membrane compartments or subcom - partments is the Ras superfamily of small GTPases . These include proteins implicated in signalling ( for example , the Ras family itself ) , actin regulation ( for example , the Rho family ) , organelle and vesicular transport ( for example , the Arf , Arl and Rab families ) 23 . Small GTPases shuttle between a GDP ( inactive ) - and a GTP Figure 1 | Metabolism and subcellular distribution of phosphoinositides . a , Metabolic reactions leading to the generation of seven phosphoinositide species from PtdIns .

PtdIns ( 3 ) P is concentrated in early endosomes and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 on late compartments of the endosomal pathway . The location of PtdIns ( 5 ) P remains poorly characterized . Phosphorylation / dephosphorylation events occurring on each subcellular compartment are illustrated . In the ER , the conversion from phosphatidic acid ( PA ) to PtdIns involves more than one reaction . d , Phosphoinositide - binding modules , their binding preference and some examples of proteins that contain them . REVIEWS NATURE | Vol 443 | 12 October 2006 652 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group ( active ) - bound state . When bound to GTP , they interact with a variety of effectors . This cycle is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) , which stimulate GTP loading and hydrolysis , respectively . Not surprisingly , many examples of a close functional relationship between phosphoinositide metabolism and these proteins have been reported ( Fig . 3 ) . First , phosphoinositides regulate the recruitment of GAPs and GEFs to membranes and their activity , given the presence of phosphoinositide - binding modules in many of these factors ( Fig . 3a ) . Second , several phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes are effectors of GTPases , thus providing the basis for positive and negative feedback loops 22 , 28 , 29 ( Fig . 3b ) . Third , membrane - bound GTPasesoften function as co - receptors with phosphoinositides in the recruitment of cytosolic proteins to speciﬁc subcompartments ( Fig . 3c ) . Because mammalian cells express more than 100 small GTPases , the latter mechanism dramatically increases ( in a combinatorial manner ) the repertoire of identity codes for membranes and membrane domains 22 , 23 . The following sections provide an overview of some of the most important regulatory roles of phosphoinositides in the major cell compartments . Figure 2 | Coincidence detection in phosphoinositide signalling . a , Phosphoinositides mediate the recruitment of proteins to membranes using their phosphorylated head groups . A high speciﬁcity is achieved when other signals act in concert with phosphoinositides . This dual - key mechanismplaysanimportant part inthespatialandtemporalregulationof the interactions between cytosolic proteins and membranes . b , To illustrate the concept of coincidence detection , the case of the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 is shown . This protein complex , which consists of four subunits ( a , b 2 , m 2 and j 2 ) , is selectively recruited to the plasma membrane owing , in part , to its ability to bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . It has been proposed that an initial contact with this membrane mediated by the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding site present on the a subunit triggers a conformational change in the m 2 subunit . This change , in turn , leads to the exposure of an additional binding site for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and of a bindingsite for membraneprotein co - receptors , such ascargoproteinsharbouringtyrosine - basedmotifs ( YXX f , where f denotes bulky , hydrophobicresidues ) . Thesemultipleinteractions , whichcan alsobe modulated by the phosphorylation of AP - 2 , cooperate in stabilizing the association of AP - 2 with the plasma membrane . Although cargo proteins are also present in intracellular membranes , AP - 2 is not efﬁciently recruited to such membranes owing to the lack of a cognate phosphoinositide 26 . c , A schematic drawing illustrating changes in phosphoinositide composition ( represented by changes in membrane colour ) that accompany fusion and budding reactions . On fusion , a vesicle will acquire the predominant phosphoinositide composition of the target membrane . Conversely , membranebudding generates a new closed compartment whose phosphoinositide composition can be rapidly and globally changed .

These three mechanisms ( a , b , c ) can occur simultaneously on the same membrane compartment , thereby giving rise to complex feedback loops . NATURE | Vol 443 | 12 October 2006 REVIEWS 653 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group Classical signal transduction at the plasma membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which is concentrated in the plasma membrane , par - ticipates in nearly all events that occur at , or involve , the cell surface ( Fig . 4 ) . In addition , it plays a major part in the transduction of extracellular signals , either via its metabolites , or through ﬂuctuations of its own levels . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is produced by the phosphorylation of either PtdIns ( 4 ) P ( by type I PtdInsP kinases ) or PtdIns ( 5 ) P ( by type II PtdInsP kinases ) 5 , 14 , 19 . There is only very little PtdIns ( 5 ) P in cells and most cell surface PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is generated from PtdIns ( 4 ) P . This lipid is delivered to the cell surface by membrane carriers derived from the Golgi complex and from recycling organelles ( see below ) , but is also produced locally at the plasma membrane 18 . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis is due to both phospholipases and phosphatases with fundamentally different physiological consequences . Cleavage by phospholipases , such as phospholipase C ( PLC ) and phospholipase A2 ( PLA2 ) , gives rise to metabolites that propagate and amplify signalling , whereas dephosphorylation , primarily by 5 - phosphatases , controls steady - state levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and turns off its signal - ling . For example , during endocytosis , dephosphorylation removes PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from internalized membranes , thus restricting the localization of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the cell surface without coupling the endocytic reaction to the generation of signalling metabolites 30 . Another fate of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is conversion to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 primarily by class I phosphoinositide ( 3 ) kinases ( PI ( 3 ) kinases ) 31 – 33 . This lipid is present in negligible amounts in resting cells , but can transiently and dramatically increase in response to growth factor stimulation . Its regulatory role is of fundamental importance in the physiology of higher eukaryotes , as it mediates a large variety of effects , including cell proliferation , migration , chemotaxis , phago - and macro - pinocytosis , differentiation , survival and metabolic changes 31 – 33 . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 acts by recruiting effectors that activate synergistic signalling pathways 31 . Prominent among the PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 target proteins are GEFs and GAPs for small GTPases that function as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton , and the protein kinases PDK and AKT / PKB , which cooperate in the activation of important signalling cascades , such as the Tor pathway 31 , 32 . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is dephosphorylated by two types of enzymes , with different outcomes . Dephosphorylation at the 3 position by PTEN is the ‘off’ signal 34 . In contrast , dephosphorylation by 5 - phosphatases , such as SHIP - 1 and 2 , generates PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , which shares several actions with PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( in addition to unique signalling properties ) and may prolong the duration of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 signal - ling 17 . This has major relevance to medicine , given the importance of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 metabolism imbalance in diabetes 32 and cancer 31 . PTEN is also a potent tumour suppressor ( Table 1 ) 34 , 35 . Regulation of integral plasma membrane proteins An emerging theme in phosphoinositide signalling is the involve - ment of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the regulation of integral membrane proteins at the plasma membrane . These include a variety of inward rectiﬁer and voltage - gated potassium channels , calcium channels and pumps , transient receptor potential channels , epithelial sodium channels , ion exchangers 36 , 37 and probably , many other classes of proteins , such as receptors for chemical ligands . For some proteins , presence of binding sites for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may represent a mechanism for optimal function in their appropriate cellular con - text , that is , the plasma membrane . In other cases , regulation by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may allow these proteins to function as effectors of receptors coupled to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis or degradation . Regu - latory actions of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are well documented for several transient receptor potential channels , many of which function in sensory transduction 36 , 37 . Plasma membrane – cytoskeleton interactions PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , often in concert with small GTPases , participate in the recruitment and activation of a wide variety of actin regulatory proteins at the plasma membrane , thereby controlling cell shape , motility , cytokinesis and a wide variety of other processes . A well - characterized mechanism governing actin polymerization and involving PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the ARP2 / 3 - mediated nucleation of actin networks . For example , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , in cooperation with the small GTPase Cdc42 , binds N - WASP and triggers a conformational change that allows its binding to and activation of the ARP2 / 3 complex 38 , 39 . Other activators of N - WASP ( for example , Toca ) are also recruited to the plasma membrane by the cooperative action of phosphoinositides and Cdc42 , thus providing mechanisms for the ampliﬁcation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 action 40 . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 facilitates actin ﬁlament elongation at the plus ends ( that is , the actin ﬁlament tip at which addition of G - actin monomers preferentially occurs ) by promoting the dissociation of capping proteins , such as gelsolin and CapZ 5 . In addition , through its binding to proﬁlin , it promotes the dissociation of actin - monomer – proﬁlin complexes , thus making G - actin available 5 , 38 . Binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is also critical for the function of proteins that act as adaptors between the membrane and the actin cytoskeleton at sites of cell – matrix or cell – cell adhesion . These adaptors include the band 4 . 1 / ezrin / radixin / moesin ( FERM ) domain - containing proteins . Typically , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binds to the FERM domain of these proteins , thus releasing them from an autoinhibited state . The FERM domain of talin not only binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which enhances its afﬁnity for integrins , but also the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - synthesizing enzyme PtdInsP kinase type 1 g and so helps generate this lipid at sites of cell adhesion 41 , 42 . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 mediates the effect of growth factors on the formation of the peripheral rufﬂes implicated in cell migration 32 , 43 . Mechanistically , the actions of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are similar to those of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , although they often involve a distinct set of effector proteins . For example , WAVE , a WASP - related protein , is speciﬁcally recruited and activated by PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( ref . 43 ) . In Dictyostelium discoideum , the spatial restriction of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at the leading edge is responsible for polarized cell migration during chemotaxis 44 . The regulatory function of phosphoinositides on the cytoskeleton is not restricted to actin . For instance , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched micro - domains in the plasma membrane participate in the regulation of microtubule plus - end capture and stabilization , a phenomenon required for normal polarized motility 45 . In another example , a microtubular motor was shown to be anchored to cell organelles using a phosphoinositide - binding pleckstrin homology domain , thus implicating phosphoinositides in microtubule - based intracellular motility 46 .

REVIEWS NATURE | Vol 443 | 12 October 2006 654 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group Exocytosis Plasma membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is directly implicated in exocytosis owing to a critical role at a pre - fusion stage ( that is , ‘vesicle priming’ ) . It acts both in cis on plasma membrane proteins ( such as CAPS , a primingfactor inneuroendocrinecells ) and in trans onvesicleproteins ( suchassynaptotagmin , aCa 2 þ sensorforexocytosis ) 12 , 47 . Importantly , in - trans interactions probably cooperate with SNARE pairing 48 in marking the plasma membrane as the appropriate partner for the fusion of these organelles . Generally , levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane positively correlate with the size of the readily releasable pool of secretory vesicles ( that is the pool of membrane - docked vesicles that is competent for exocytosis ) 49 – 51 . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also indirectly affects exocytosis through metabolites produced by PLC - dependent cleavage : diacylglycerol is a critical ligand for the priming factor Munc13 ( refs 52 , 53 ) , whereas Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 mediates calcium responses that modulate and in some cases trigger secretion . Endocytosis PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has an important role in all forms of endocytosis , because it functions as an important co - receptor for the recruitment and regulation of endocytic proteins selectively to the plasma membrane 22 , 27 . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( in most cases also PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) binds all the known endocytic clathrin adaptors ( for example , AP - 2 , AP180 / CALM , epsin ) and many other endocytic factors , including dynamin , which controls the ﬁssion reaction 22 , 24 , 27 . Other actions of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in endocytosis reﬂect its effects on the actin cytoskele - ton , which is implicated in all internalization pathways 54 . Speciﬁc retention of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at the plasma membrane and rapid dissociation of endocytic factors follow - ing internalization require the removal of these phosphoinositides from endocytic membranes . This function is largely fulﬁlled by inositol ( 5 ) phosphatases , as highlighted by studies on synaptojanin 1 , an enzyme implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling 11 , 30 . The function of synaptojanin is tightly interconnected with that of dynamin , suggesting a mechanism that couples endocytic vesicle ﬁssion and phosphoinositide dephosphorylation 11 . In budding yeast , conditional disruption of synaptojanin function results in ectopic accumulation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on internal membranes 55 . Phagocytosis and pathogen entry Phagocytosis ( that is , the engulfment of large particles $ 0 . 5 m m in diameter ) , begins with the activation of cell surface receptors by ligands that are present on the foreign particle 56 . This event triggers the local polymerization of actin , leading to the formation of cell protrusions ( pseudopods ) that engulf and ‘seal’ the particle . This process requires PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and local production of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which stimulates actin nucleation . On ‘sealing’ however , catabolism of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 —mediated at least in part by PLC—and of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is critical for the shedding of actin and fusion of phagosomes with the endosome / lysosome compartment 56 . A special form of phagocytosis is the internalization of pathogenic bacteria , which capitalize in several ways on phosphoinositide - mediated signalling to invade and thrive in host cells ( Table 1 ) 57 . In a notable example of this interrelationship , some bacteria deliver phos - phoinositide phosphatases into host cell cytoplasm that then help reprogram cell function to facilitate invasion and / or to determine the appropriate fate of pathogen - containing vacuoles ( Table 1 ) 17 , 57 – 61 . Golgi complex function PtdIns ( 4 ) P is the predominant phosphoinositide in the Golgi - complex region and a deﬁciency of this lipid affects its structure and function . In yeast , mutations of the Golgi - localized PtdIns ( 4 ) kinase PIK1 result in an accumulation of abnormal membrane intermediates ( ‘Berkeley bodies’ ) with impairment of transport to the plasma membrane 18 . These defects are reminiscent of those produced by mutations of the GTPase ARF1 62 , which may reﬂect the property of PtdIns ( 4 ) P to function as a co - receptor with ARF1 in the recruitment onto trans - Golgi network membranes of cytosolic proteins such as the clathrin adaptor AP - 1 , the GGA proteins and FAPP1 / 2 ( refs 23 , 63 ) . The mammalianPIK1 homologue , PtdIns ( 4 ) kinasetype III b , interacts with and is stimulated by ARF1 , indicating that this GTPase can cooperate with PtdIns ( 4 ) P by multiple and synergistic mechanisms 63 ( see alsoFig . 3b ) . Inaddition , disruption of Golgi integrity is produced by the knockdown of another PtdIns ( 4 ) kinase , type II a ( ref . 25 ) . Spatial restriction of PtdIns ( 4 ) P to the Golgi complex is ensured by phosphatases , one of which is likely to be Sac1 ( ref . 64 ) . This protein is an ER - and Golgi - complex - associated phosphoinositide phosphatase , which may thus dephosphorylate PtdIns ( 4 ) P when retrograde trafﬁc occurs from the Golgi complex to the ER 64 . Mutant sac1 yeast cells have high levels of PtdIns ( 4 ) P , including high levels at the plasma membrane 65 , which may be an indirect result of the excessive build - up of PtdIns ( 4 ) P in early secretory compartments . The presence of pools of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the Golgi complex has been suggested by the reported localization of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - metabo - lizing enzymes , primarily the disease - linked inositol ( 5 ) phosphatase , Table 1 | Phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes that have been linked to human diseases .

The functional signiﬁcance of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the Golgi complex remains unclear . Endosome dynamics PtdIns ( 3 ) P and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 have a crucial role in the biology of endosomes—a heterogeneous system of membranes that function as crossroads for trafﬁc from and to the plasma membrane , the Golgi complex and the lysosomes 18 . PtdIns ( 3 ) P is a major determinant of early endosome membrane identity , and participates in nearly all aspects of endosomal function , such as membrane tethering and fusion , interaction with the cytoskeleton , signalling and motility . PtdIns ( 3 ) P - binding modules , primarily FYVE and PX domains , are present in a variety of endosomal proteins , such as EEA1 , Hrs and SARA 15 , 16 , 21 , 67 . These proteins are generally localized to distinct subdomains of the endosomal system 68 , suggesting that PtdIns ( 3 ) P binding confers a ﬁrst layer of speciﬁcity to their subcellular targeting and that other interactions ﬁne - tune their precise localization . Several PtdIns ( 3 ) P - binding proteins also bind Rab5 , an early endosome - associated GTPase , thus providing a powerful and highly speciﬁc coincidence detection mechanism for the recruitment of such proteins to early endosomes . Rab5 , in turn , regulates PtdIns ( 3 ) P synthesis through two distinct pathways . The majority of this lipid is produced from PtdIns by the class III PI ( 3 ) kinase VPS34 , a Rab5 effector 10 , 18 , 68 . An additional pool of PtdIns ( 3 ) P is generated along the endocytic pathway through the sequential dephosphorylation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 by inositol phosphatases speciﬁc for the 5 and 4 positions , respectively . The latter pathway , which is upregulated by growth factor stimu - lation , coordinates the internalization of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - enriched membranes with the modiﬁcation of their phosphoinositide content to match the property of endosomal membranes 29 . PtdIns ( 3 ) P can undergo dephosphorylation at the endosomal surface , degradation within the lumen of multivesicular bodies , or phosphorylation to PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 by the Fab1p / PIKfyve kinase 18 , 69 . A main function of PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 may be to trigger budding of vesicles from late endosomes and many of the effects of Fab1p / PIKfyve disruption ( for example , swelling of the yeast vacuole and of late endosomes in mammalian cells ) may be explained by defective membrane recycling from this compartment . Dephosphorylation of PtdIns ( 3 ) P and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is achieved by members of the myotubularin 34 and Sac1 families 64 . Human genetic diseases have been mapped to genes encoding myotubularin family members 70 , 71 and PIKfyve 72 , although the precise role of phosphoinositide metabolism imbalance in the phenotypic manifestations of these diseases remains poorly understood ( Table 1 ) . Functions at other intracellular locations Although PtdIns is synthesized in the ER , the presence of its phosphorylated derivatives in this compartment remains very much an open question . Phosphoinositide phosphatases located on this organelle , such as Sac1 and SKIP , may act primarily to dephos - phorylate phosphoinositides inappropriately delivered to its mem - branes . Alternatively , they may act in trans on other membranes . The potential role of phosphoinositides in mitochondria remains un - explored , although enzymes , such as a synaptojanin splice variant , have been reported there 19 , 63 . As mentioned above , phosphoinositides and phosphoinositide - binding proteins have been described in non - membranouslocationsin the nucleus 20 , which may reﬂectthe presence of proteins with hydrophobic pockets that are able to accommodate their fatty acid tails . Consistent with these observations , major phos - phoinositide - metabolizing enzymes are found in the nucleus , and there is evidence for a role of phosphoinositides in pre - messenger - RNA splicing , chromatin remodelling and gene transcription 20 . Concluding remarks As is clear from this overview , phosphoinositides occupy a general and central place in the ﬁeld of cell signalling and regulation . A challenge for the future will be to elucidate how signalling effects elicited by their rapid metabolic changes are coordinated with their constitutive functions in a variety of cell processes . Surprisingly , many key phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes remain poorly characterized and the function of only a small subset of them has been genetically explored , at least in higher organisms . A central question is whether thecontinuousturnoverofeachphosphoinositide ( referredto in some cases as a ‘futile’ cycle ) primarily serves to allow for rapid changes and a ﬁne regulation of their levels , or whether turnover is intimately connected to their mechanisms of action . An important issue in phosphoinositide signalling is to what extent the levels of ‘free’ phosphoinositides are controlled by phospho - inositide - sequestering proteins ( for example , ‘pipmodulins’ ) 45 , 73 . At theplasmamembrane , pipmodulins , suchas MARCKS , are thoughtto buffer PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and to release it after appropriate stimuli ( for example , protein phosphorylation ) , thus potentially contributing another layer of regulation 73 . One priority in phosphoinositide research is the further develop - ment of methods for their efﬁcient detection and for the discrimi - nation of phosphoinositides with different fatty acid compositions . Genetically encoded , ﬂuorescent , phosphoinositide - binding modules are now commonly used to image phosphoinositides in living cells , but the presence in these modules of additional binding sites for cellular proteins ( and / or other lipids ) , or the masking of phospho - inositides by endogenous proteins , may bias the results . The extent to which speciﬁc phosphoinositide pools are invisible to these probes is a highly debated issue , because the locations of some phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes seem to be in disagreement with the predo - minant location of the substrates and / or products revealed by such probes . Whether pools of phosphoinositides at locations that are not revealed by these probes do exist and are physiologically important remains an open question . Finally , the involvement of several key phosphoinositide metabolic reactions in disease makes this area of research highly relevant to medicine ( see also Table 1 ) . Further elucidation of the role of phos - phoinositides in cell biology and organismal physiology is expected to provide new potential targets for pharmacological interventions in major human diseases , including cancer and diabetes . 1 .
