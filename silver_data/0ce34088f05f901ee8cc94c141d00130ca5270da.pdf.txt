Nichols MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 2QH , UK * e - mail : ben @ mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk Published online : 15 April 2002 ; DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb787 Mammalian cells endocytose a variety of proteins and lipids without utilising clathrin - coated pits 1 – 5 . Detailed molecular mechanisms for clathrin - independent endocy - tosis are unclear . Several markers for this process , including glycosphingolipid - binding bacterial toxin sub - units such as cholera toxin B subunit ( CTxB ) , and glyco - syl - phosphatidyl - inositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins , are found in detergent - resistant membrane fractions ( DRMs ) , or ‘lipid rafts’ 2 , 3 , 5 – 7 . The Golgi complex constitutes one principal intracellular destination for these markers 2 . Uptake of both CTxB and GPI - anchored proteins may involve caveolae , small invaginations in the plasma mem - brane ( PM ) 8 – 13 . However , the identity of intermediate organelles involved in PM to Golgi trafficking , as well as the function of caveolins , defining protein components of caveolae 12 , 13 , are unclear . This paper shows that mole - cules which partition into DRMs and are endocytosed in a clathrin - independent fashion , accumulate in a discrete population of endosomes en route to the Golgi complex . These endosomes are devoid of markers for classical early and recycling endosomes , but do contain caveolin - 1 . Caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes are sites for the sorting of caveolin - 1 away from Golgi - bound cargoes , although caveolin - 1 itself is unlikely to have a direct function in PM to Golgi transport . W hen observed by light microscopy , caveolin - 1 is found in three morphologically distinct types of structure : fine puncta on the PM ( which presumably correspond to indi - vidual caveolae ) , larger , scattered puncta , and the Golgi com - plex 14 , 15 ( Fig . 1a ) . To assess whether any of these structures func - tion as endosomes , COS - 7 , CV - 1 and NRK cells expressing car - boxy - terminally green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged caveolin - 1 ( which has the same distribution as the endogenous protein 14 ) were incubated for various times with fluorescent 10K dextran , washed extensively and then examined with a confocal micro - scope . After a 15 min - uptake , around 60 % of the structures con - taining detectable 10K dextran were also positive for caveolin - 1 ( percentage overlap calculated as described 2 , n = 5 ) . These were all relatively large , scattered caveolin - 1 - positive puncta ( Fig . 1a and 1b ) . After longer times , caveolin - 1 - positive structures accounted for a progressively smaller proportion of the total intracellular 10K dextran . A similar colocalization between endocytosed 10K dex - tran and caveolin - 1 was also observed by indirect immunofluores - cence of endogenous caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 1c ) . However , the brightness of caveolin - 1 staining in 10K - dextran - positive structures relative to other pools of caveolin - 1 in the cell was slightly less , either because of the slight increase in caveolin - 1 expression levels in transfected cells 14 , or because of subtle changes in the accessibility or conformation of caveolin - 1 epitopes . These data show that caveolin - 1 is present in a population of intracellular membranes defined as endosomes through their involvement in fluid - phase endocytosis . Time - lapse imaging identified occasional long - range translocation of caveolin - 1 - containing endosomes through the cytoplasm , reinforcing the conclusion that these dynamic struc - tures are not continuous with the PM ( Supplementary Information , movie 1 ) . Consistent with previous studies 12 , 14 , 15 , there was no overlap between caveolin - 1 and markers for classical early and recycling endosomes , including endocytosed transferrin , EEA1 , rab5 and rab11 ( data not shown ) . However , uptake of CTxB , a protein which is endocytosed , at least in part , through a clathrin - inde - pendent mechanism 2 , 8 , 9 , resulted in the clear accumulation of CTxB within all caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes ( Fig . 1d ) . GPI - anchored GFP ( GPI – GFP ) together with another GPI - anchored protein CD59 , which in common with CTxB are transported from the PM to the Golgi complex independently of clathrin 2 , also accumulated in caveolin - 1 endosomes ( Fig . 1e ) . Caveolin - 1 - containing endosomes , or ‘caveosomes’ , have previously been shown to function during the trafficking of SV40 virus from the PM to the endoplasmic reticulum 14 . As predicted by this obser - vation , when cells were allowed to endocytose CTxB and SV40 for between 1 and 3 h , colocalization of both markers in cave - olin - 1 - positive endosomes was readily detected ( Fig . 1f ) . However , the distribution of SV40 in structures containing CTxB and caveolin - 1 was not stochastic – antibodies against SV40 labelled a proportion of caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes very brightly , but other similar structures were not labelled at all . There are several possible explanations for this . One explanation is that caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes could be functionally het - erogeneous , even in the absence of SV40 . There are clear kinetic differences in the uptake of CTxB and SV40 , and the aggregation of SV40 particles or the aggregation of membrane receptors induced by individual SV40 particles may function in accessing , as well as potentially modifying , caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes . Until caveosomes in SV40 - infected cells are shown to be func - tionally equivalent to the caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes described here , it seems prudent to restrict the use of the term caveosome to structures specifically involved in the transport of SV40 . The preceding data show that caveolin - 1 , one of the defining components of caveolae at the plasma membrane , is also present in a distinct class of intracellular endosomes . These endosomes were labelled with markers for clathrin - independent endocytosis to the Golgi complex and with SV40 virus , but not with markers internal - ized through clathrin - coated pits . However , the establishment of a functional link between entry into caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes and delivery to the Golgi was hampered by the fact that the relevant © 2002 Nature Publishing Group brief communications NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 MAY 2002 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 375 markers also accumulated in other structures . In the case of GPI - anchored proteins , these could either be other types of endosome or exocytic transport intermediates 2 . In the case of CTxB , these are probably transferrin - containing early and recycling endosomes , as a significant portion of total CTxB uptake occurs through clathrin - coated pits 2 , 9 , 16 ( only 30 % of CTxB in punctate structures colocalized with caveolin - 1 – GFP : n = 5 ( ref . 2 ) , see Fig . 1d ) . To dissect the role of different types of endosome in the uptake of CTxB to the Golgi , expression of a truncated form of the clathrin accessory protein AP180 ( AP180 - C ) was used to block clathrin - mediated endocyto - sis 17 . In AP180 - C - expressing cells , CTxB labelled the Golgi complex as normal , but transferrin uptake was efficiently blocked ( Fig . 2a ) . Strikingly , when the distributions of CTxB after a 30 - min uptake and caveolin - 1 were compared in AP180 - C - expressing cells , CTxB only accumulated in structures containing caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 2b ) . After just 10 min of uptake , CTxB labelled caveolin - 1 - positive Cav1 – GFP Cav1 – GFP Cav1 CD59 – GFP CTxB 10K dextran 10K dextran SV40 Cav1 Cav1 – GFP Cav1 – GFP 10K dextran 10K dextran 10K dextran a b c d e f CTxB Figure 1 Caveolin - 1 is found in intracellular endosomes that label with CTxB , GPI - anchored proteins and SV40 . a , .

Note that the perinuclear fluorescence from CTxB – Cy5 in cells not expressing AP180 - C represents signal from both Golgi and recycling endosomal membranes , and that the decrease in total CTxB taken up in cells expressing AP180 - C reflects a block in entry into recycling endosomes 2 . Uptake of transferrin and CTxB was for 30 min . b , In the absence of clathrin - mediated uptake , CTxB – Cy5 accumulates exclusively in caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes before delivery to the Golgi complex .

Additionally , a comparison of the localization of CTxB and a mark - er for transferrin - containing early endosomes , EEA1 ( ref . 18 ) , in control cells identified substantial overlap , whereas in AP180 - C - expressing cells little or no colocalization between these markers was detected ( Fig . 2d ) . Thus , when clathrin function is impeded , markers for clathrin - independent endocytosis are found exclusively in cave - olin - 1 - positive endosomes and subsequently in the Golgi complex , directly implicating these endosomes in PM to Golgi trafficking . The implication that caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes are involved in PM to Golgi transport raised the question of how caveolin - 1 itself traffics within this pathway . The exchange of caveolin - 1 in and out of caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes was measured by selective photobleaching of caveolin - 1 – GFP in these structures ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Recovery of caveolin - 1 – GFP fluores - cence was observed , with a half - time of approximately 35 min . Thus , caveolin - 1 may be constitutively transported between the PM and caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes . The conclusion that caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes are relatively persistent structures that are continuously involved in traffic with the PM is rein - forced by the finding that when cells were allowed to take up 10K dextran for 20 min , washed extensively , and then labelled with CTxB , an accumulation of CTxB in the prelabelled , 10K - dex - tran - containing , caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes was still detect - ed ( Fig . 3c ) . 0 50 100 150 200 0 20 40 60 80 A M ean p i x e l i n t en s i t y min post - bleach Whole cell Non - Golgi Golgi a b Pre - bleach 0 min 40 min – chx + chx f c d e 0 50 100 150 200 0 20 40 60 80 M ean p i x e l i n t en s i t y min post - bleach Whole cell Cav1 endosomes Pre - bleach Cav1 – GFP 10K dextran 0 min 80 min Cav1 – GFP CTxB 10K dextran Figure 3 Caveolin - 1 does not exchange between the PM and the Golgi com - plex . a , Photobleaching of caveolin - 1 – GFP in caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes .

Times shown are relative to completion of the photobleaching . e , Quantification of the mean fluorescence intensities from a typical photobleaching experiment , as in d . Partial recovery of fluorescence intensity within the Golgi region is caused by the lateral movement of caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes or PM caveolin - 1 into the region , rather than refilling of the Golgi itself . f , Cycloheximide treatment ( 200 µ g ml − 1 , 3 h ) empties endogenous caveolin - 1 ( labelled with a polyclonal antibody , red ) from the Golgi complex ( labelled with an anti - Gos28 monoclonal antibody , green ) . 0 0 . 20 . 4 0 . 60 . 81 . 0 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 Cav1 expression relative to control m ean pe r i nu c l ea r C T x B / m ean w ho l e c e ll C T x B a b c Cav1 Cav1 Cav2 GOS 28 CTxB Cells lacking caveolin - 1 Control cells Cells expressing dyn2 K44A Figure 4 Caveolin - 1 is not required for trafficking of the CTxB subunit from the PM to the Golgi complex . a , The reduction in caveolin - 1 expression to back - ground levels has no effect on CTxB – Cy5 uptake . Caveolin - 1 expression was inhibit - ed by transfection with small RNA duplexes ( see Methods ) . Caveolin - 1 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence . In four of the cells shown , the caveolin - 1 signal is no greater than the background detected with an irrelevant primary antibody ( poly - clonal anti - Myc ) . This is not caused by general changes in protein expression or problems with the immunofluorescence protocol , as the same cells stained normal - ly with anti - GOS28 antibodies . b , A reduction in caveolin - 1 expression to back - ground levels replicates one of the phenotypes of caveolin - 1 gene knockout . In cells lacking detectable caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 2 expression is reduced and caveolin - 2 is not detected outside the Golgi complex 20 , 21 . c , Quantification of CTxB – Cy5 distri - bution in cells lacking caveolin - 1 .

Elimination of perinuclear ( that is , Golgi ) caveolin - 1 – GFP fluorescence had no effect on the amount of caveolin - 1 – GFP fluorescence found in the rest of the cell ( Fig . 3d , e ) . Furthermore , in cycloheximide - treated cells , the perinuclear pool of caveolin - 1 – GFP did not recover after the photobleaching , even after 40 min ( Fig . 3d , e ) . This lack of recovery was not caused by phototoxic effects , as when the same protocol was carried out on cells expressing GPI – GFP , which cycles between the PM and the Golgi complex , full recovery of the Golgi pool was observed ( data not shown ) 2 . Moreover , simply treating cells with cycloheximide was sufficient to empty endogenous caveolin - 1 from the Golgi complex ( Fig . 3f ) . This implies that the Golgi pool of caveolin - 1 is dependent on new protein synthesis and not on exchange with caveolin - 1 at the PM or in endosomes . The conclusions that the intermediate organelles through which CTxB passes between the PM and the Golgi complex all contain caveolin - 1 , but that caveolin - 1 does not itself pass from these organelles to the Golgi , imply that CTxB must be sorted away from caveolin - 1 . Rapid , dual - colour time - lapse microscopy confirmed that this is the case ( Supplementary Information , movie 2 ) . When caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes containing CTxB were examined over time , small CTxB - positive , caveolin - negative structures could be observed forming on the endosomes , budding away from them , and moving away through the cytosol . These structures frequently moved in a highly directed fashion towards the Golgi region ( Supplementary Information , movie 2 ) . The behaviour of CTxB - containing structures budding from caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes was not altered by expression of AP180 - C ( data not shown ) . Together , the observations above argue strongly that these struc - tures carry CTxB to the Golgi . The preceding data establishes caveolin - 1 as a marker for endo - somes involved in PM to Golgi trafficking . To determine whether caveolin - 1 is directly involved in this process , COS - 7 cells were transfected with two duplex RNA oligonucleotides , each composed of 21 bases of sequence that is completely conserved in caveolin - 1 from several mammalian species 19 . Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that after 48 h , caveolin - 1 expression dropped to lev - els that were indistinguishable from background signal ( that is , to less than 5 % of expression levels in control cells ) in around 30 – 50 % of cells . This did not measurably affect the uptake of CTxB ( Figs 4a and 4c ) . Furthermore , it was not caused by upregulation of a clathrin - dependent pathway , because the elimination of caveolin - 1 expression in AP180 - C - expressing cells had the same effect on CTxB uptake , as observed with the AP180 - C construct alone ( data not shown ) . Additionally , the steady - state distribution of GPI – GFP between the PM and the Golgi complex was unchanged in cells lacking detectable caveolin - 1 ( data not shown ) . In caveolin - 1 knockout mice , caveolin - 2 expression is greatly reduced , and cave - olin - 2 is restricted in its subcellular distribution to the Golgi com - plex 20 , 21 . The same phenomenon was observed in cells transfected with caveolin - 1 - specific duplex RNA oligonucleotides ( Fig . 4b ) . So , in this case , transfection with RNA oligonucleotides replicates the phenotype of gene knockout . Thus , as trafficking of the markers that are found in caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes is not perturbed by a reduction in caveolin - 1 expression to background levels , it is unlikely that caveolin - 1 forms an essential component of the rele - vant membrane trafficking machinery . The fact that mice lacking the gene for caveolin - 1 are viable and develop relatively normally 20 , 21 argues against an essential role for caveolin - 1 in any membrane trafficking pathways that are critical for cell function . However , endothelial cells that lack caveolin - 1 do show defects in the uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) – albumen 22 , though the physiological importance of the caveolar endocytosis of this ligand remains unclear . Normal CTxB uptake when caveolin - 1 expression was reduced to undetectable levels is consistent with the finding that CTxB uptake and cholera toxin toxicity ( which requires delivery to the ER - Golgi system ) occurs even in cells such as lymphocytes , which naturally lack caveolae and caveolins 8 . Thus , it seems likely that caveolin - 1 enters caveolin - 1 - positive endosomes as a cargo molecule , rather than as an active component of the relevant trafficking machinery . Now that the existence of a distinct class of endosomes that function in PM to Golgi trafficking has been established , further questions need to be addressed . It will be important to relate previ - ous electron - micrographic and biochemical data on the distribu - tion of caveolin - 1 inside the cell to the dynamic properties of cave - olin - 1 - containing endosomes 10 – 13 , 15 , 28 . Currently , the relevant mem - brane trafficking machinery is not understood in detail , although a dynamin GTPase may well be involved in the initial budding step 9 – 11 ( Fig . 4c , and B . Nichols , unpublished observations ) . Similarly , the relationship between DRMs and caveolae , as well as the potential function of sorting signals in the ectodomain of GPI - anchored proteins , will require further investigation 22 – 27 . Finally , although the rates of exchange of markers for rafts / DRMs between the PM and the Golgi are likely to be considerably slower than , for example , the receptor - mediated uptake of transferrin 2 , such exchange may well be important for maintaining the lipid compo - sitions of these organelles , and for remodelling the PM during cell polarization . Direct tests of the functional significance of the path - way will require development of more specific inhibitors .
