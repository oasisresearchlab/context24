Supplemental Experimental Procedures DNA Constructs Human INF2 ORF clone ( CAAX variant , catalog number SC313010 ) was obtained from OriGene Technologies , Inc ( Rockville , MD ) . INF2 - FFC ( amino acids 469 - 1249 ) , INF2 - FFD ( amino acids 469 - 1015 ) , and INF2 - FF ( 469 - 941 ) were amplified using a GC - rich PCR system ( Roche Applied Science ) and subcloned into pGEX - KT vector [ 1 ] with a modified tobacco etch virus protease site for bacterial expression as a glutathione S - transferase fusion protein . GFP - fusions were made by cloning in PCR amplified INF2 into a pGEX - KT vector modified with eGFP . The GFP contained the A206K mutation , which reduces self - association dramatically [ 2 ] . Protein Preparation and Purification All formin constructs were expressed in Rosetta2 E . coli ( Stratagene Inc ) as GST fusion proteins , following procedures used previously [ 3 ] . The constructs used were INF2 - FFC ( human CAAX variant , amino acids 469 - 1249 ) , INF2 - FF ( human , 469 - 941 ) , INF2 - FFD ( human , 469 - 1015 ) , GFP - INF2 - FFC , GFP - INF2 - FF , FMNL3 - FH2 ( mouse ) , and mDia1 - FH2 ( mouse ) . Briefly , expression was induced in log phase cultures with 0 . 5 mM IPTG at 16˚C . After expression , extracts were passed over glutathione - Sepharose , cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease to elute the formin construct from GST , and further purified by ion exchange chromatography on SourceQ and / or gel filtration by Superdex200 . All proteins were stored at - 80°C in K50MEIDT . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified from acetone powder [ 4 ] and labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide [ 5 ] , Alexa 488 - succinimidyl ester ( Invitrogen A20000 ) or TAMRA NHS ester ( Invitrogen C1171 ) [ 6 ] . Both labeled and unlabeled actin were gel - filtered on Supderdex200 and stored in G buffer at 4°C . Cofilin ( budding yeast , D34C mutant ) and Alexa488 - labeled cofilin ( maleimide link to cysteine 34 ) were expressed and purified as described previously [ 7 ] . Buffers The following buffers were used frequently : G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris , pH 8 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) , G - Mg buffer ( same as G - buffer but with 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 instead of CaCl 2 ) , 10 × K50MEI ( 500 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , and 100 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) , 10 × Na50MEI ( same as 10 × K50MEI but with 500 mM NaCl instead of KCl ) , and polymerization buffer ( G - Mg buffer plus either 1 × K50MEI or 1 × Na50MEI and 0 . 5 mM thesit ( the common name for the detergent nonaethylene glycol monododecyl ether ( Sigma , P - 9641 ) , which was included to minimize protein adhesion to the tube / well ) . Polymerization buffer with 1 × Na50MEI was used for pelleting assays because dodecyl sulfate precipitates as the potassium salt . Protein storage buffer ( K50MEIDT ) was composed of 1xK50MEI , 1mM DTT , 0 . 02 % thesit . The TIRF buffer contained : 1xKMEI , 100mM DTT , 0 . 2mM ATP , 15mM Glucose , 0 . 5 % Methyl Cellulose , 0 . 01mg / mL catalase ( Sigma C3515 ) , 0 . 05mg / mL glucose oxidase ( Sigma G6125 ) , 0 . 1 % BSA ) . In cases of phosphate addition , 10 mM NaPO 4 pH 7 . 0 was added from a 500 mM stock . TIRF Microscopy Glass flow chambers were prepared from either VWR microcover glass ( 24x60mm No 1 . 5 ) and Gold Seal Rite - On micro slides ( 3x1 inch ) or VWR microcover glasses ( 22x22mm and 18x18mm No 1 . 5 ) to hold 10µL volume . Three distinct methods for coverglass preparation were used , described in turn below . Method 1 : NEM - myosin . Flow chambers were formed then treated with 10nM N - ethylmaleimide treated rabbit skeletal muscle myosin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc MY02 ) [ 8 ] for 1 minute . Chambers were then washed with high salt , BSA containing buffer ( 1 % BSA , 50mM Tris , pH7 . 5 , 600mM NaCl ) to disassemble myosin aggregates , followed by low salt , BSA containing buffer ( 1 % BSA , 50mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 150mM NaCl ) prior to use . Method 2 : mPEG - Silane . Coverglasses were washed with acetone ( 30’ ) , 96 % ethanol ( 10’ ) , RBS 35 detergent ( Thermo 27952 ; 2 hours ) , and then water . Slides were dried with compressed airflow , incubated overnight with 5K mPEG - silane ( Laysan Bio ) at 1mg / mL in 96 % ethanol , and then rinsed with 96 % ethanol , followed by water . Chambers were washed with low salt , BSA containing buffer prior to use . Method 3 : DDS / F127 . Coverglasses were silanized using the procedure adapted from Gell et al . [ 9 ] . Briefly , coverglasses were washed in acetone ( 50’ ) , ethanol ( 10’ ) , water ( 1’ ) , then incubated in Pirhana Solution ( 1 : 2 ratio of 30 % H 2 O 2 and H 2 SO 4 ) for one hour . Glasses were then rinsed with water , 0 . 1M KOH , then water again and dried with inert gas before silanization . Glasses were silanized over night in a 0 . 0025 % solution of dichlorodimethyl silane ( Sigma 85126 ) in chloroform , then washed with methanol , dried with inert gas , and stored in clean sealed containers . For silanized cover glasses , chambers were incubated with 1 % Pluronic F127 ( Sigma P2443 ) in BRB80 buffer ( 80mM PIPES / KOH , pH 6 . 9 , 1mM EGTA , 1mM MgCl 2 ) for 1 minute , then equilibrated in TIRF buffer . For severing assays , 2µM actin ( 20 % A488 - labeled ) in G - buffer was mixed with 2xTIRF buffer , flowed into the flow chamber , and polymerized for 7 minutes with monitoring on a Nikon Eclipse TE - 2000 microscope with Nikon D - eclipse C1 488nm laser . At 7 min , 10 µ L formin or cofilin diluted in 1xTIRF buffer was flowed into the chamber , simultaneously washing out the remaining actin monomers . Images were acquired every 2s with TIRF objective ( 60x 1 . 49 N . A . ) and a Roper Cool - Snap camera . Two - color Simultaneous TIRF Microscopy For nucleation assays , unlabeled actin monomers were mixed with 20 % TAMRA - labeled actin monomers in G - buffer , then diluted with 2xTIRF buffer without or with GFP - INF2 construct and flowed into the flow chamber . The filaments were visualized as quickly as possible ( 45 - 85s ) on a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope with perfect focus and 488nm and 561nm laser . For severing assays , 2µM actin ( 20 % TAMRA - labeled ) in G - buffer was mixed with 2xTIRF buffer , flowed into the flow chamber , and polymerized for 7 minutes with monitoring . At 7 min , 10 µ L GFP - formin or A488 - cofilin diluted in 1xTIRF buffer was flowed into the chamber , simultaneously washing out the remaining actin monomers . Simultaneous two - color images were acquired every 100ms with TIRF objective ( 60x 1 . 49 N . A . ) and two iXON Ultra 897 cameras . Image Analysis and Quantification of GFP - INF2 molecules per punctum Images were processed and analyzed using Nikon NIS - Elements Software . For the determination of number of INF2 molecules per GFP punctum , single filament image sequences were background subtracted individually due to the variation in fluorescence intensity values throughout the field of view . Fluorescence intensity measurements were taken over 5 - 10 frames within 1 - 2 minutes of image sequence per diffraction - limited GFP punctum . Fluorescence intensity values were normalized to punctum area and averaged . Number of GFP - INF2 moleucles per punctum was determined by calibrating punctum fluorescence intensity values at the barbed end to represent 2 GFP - INF2 molecules ( 1 dimer ) . Co - sedimentation Assays Actin ( 4µM ) was polymerized for 1h at 23°C in polymerization buffer ( G - Mg buffer plus 1xNaMEI ) , followed by addition of 2 . 5x molar excess phalloidin . This actin stock was diluted to desired concentration in polymerization buffer in the absence or presence of formin , in polycarbonate 7x20mm centrifuge tubes ( Beckman 343775 ) to a final volume of 200µL . Filaments were pipetted using cut pipetteman tips to minimize shearing . After 5 min at 23°C , samples were centrifuged at 80 , 000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C in a TLA - 100 . 1 rotor ( Beckman ) . 100µL of supernatant was removed and mixed with SDS - PAGE sample buffer . Pellets were washed briefly with 200µL 1xNaMEI , and then resuspended in 125µL SDS - PAGE sample buffer . Pellets were analyzed by Coomassie - stained SDS - PAGE and ImageJ software . Negative Staining Electron Microscopy To make negatively stained grids , actin ( bare or INF2 - FFC - decorated ) samples are applied to EM grids with continuous carbon in 2 . 5 µL aliquots . In each grid , the applied sample is allowed to absorb to the grid for one minute , then blotted with a filter paper and stained by 6 µL 2 . 5 % uranyl acetate solution for two minutes . Prepared grids are imaged in an FEI Tecnai F20 microscope operated at 200keV acceleration . Images are taken with a Tietz F415 CCD camera ( TVIPS ) at 50 , 000 nominal magnification , giving a calibrated pixel size of 2 . 216 Å . Filaments from the CCD frames are manually selected with EMAN [ 10 ] helixboxer module . Helical 3D reconstructions are conducted with IHRSR [ 11 ] with EMAN as the reconstruction engine .
