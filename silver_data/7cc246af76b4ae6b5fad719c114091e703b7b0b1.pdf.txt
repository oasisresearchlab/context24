Nature GeNetics VOLUME 43 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2011 303 b r i e f c o m m u n i c a t i o n s We used an exome - sequencing strategy and identified an allelic series of NOTCH2 mutations in Hajdu - Cheney syndrome , an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder characterized by severe and progressive bone loss . The Hajdu - Cheney syndrome mutations are predicted to lead to the premature truncation of NOTCH2 with either disruption or loss of the C - terminal proline - glutamate - serine - threonine - rich proteolytic recognition sequence , the absence of which has previously been shown to increase Notch signaling . Hajdu - Cheney syndrome ( HCS ; MIM102500 ) is characterized by pro - gressive focal bone destruction , including acro - osteolysis and gener - alized osteoporosis , together leading to characteristic radiographic abnormalities 1 . Additional and variable manifestations include craniofacial anomalies and renal cysts 2 . To date , approximately 50 cases of HCS have been reported , with many identified as a sporadic occurrence . Within multiplex kindreds , disease segregation supports autosomal dominant inheritance 1 . Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease and is a major public health problem , yet the molecular genetic basis of osteoporosis remains poorly understood 2 . Researchers in recent genome - wide association studies have identified common variants of small effect size that contribute to osteoporosis risk 3 . However , the identification of mutations of large effect in monogenic disorders such as HCS have the capacity to provide substantial insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis and thereby identify poten - tial targets for future therapeutic intervention . The relatively small number of reported cases and the paucity of large multiplex kindreds have hindered efforts to uncover HCS gene mutations . To search for disease alleles in HCS , we performed whole - exome sequencing of three unrelated affected individuals of European origin : two sporadic cases and one individual with a multigenerational history of the disorder ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . All affected individuals had characteristic clinical and radiographic features of HCS ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We performed exome capture by in - solution hybridization followed by massively parallel sequencing ( Supplementary Methods ) . We generated over 3 . 5 Gb of sequence for each subject such that > 75 % of the coding bases of the exome defined by the Consensus Coding Sequence ( CCDS ) Project were represented by at least 20 reads ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We generated variant profiles using an in - house variant - calling pipeline 4 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) and compared the three exome variant profiles using a model of a rare autosomal dominant disorder requiring at least one previously unobserved het - erozygous non - synonymous or splice site substitution or a coding inser - tion or deletion in the same gene in all three individuals . This process identified NOTCH2 as the only candidate gene matching these criteria ( Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 3 ) . The three NOTCH2 variants are all located in exon 34 , correspond - ing to the terminal exon of the 11 . 4 - kb transcript . Each was predicted to lead to the premature termination of the protein product with a high likelihood of functional impact ( Fig . 1b ) , and we confirmed each by Sanger sequencing of the proband and all available relatives consistent with inheritance . Specifically , the two genetic variants identified in the individuals with sporadic disease ( HSC - 02 and HCS - 03 ) were shown to have arisen de novo and the third ( HSC - 01 ) was transmitted across generations between affected subjects within the kindred ( Table 1 ) . We next addressed the hypothesis that further mutant NOTCH2 alleles may explain additional cases of HCS . We performed Sanger sequencing of exon 34 and its associated acceptor splice site in 12 additional independent HCS kindreds ( 10 European and 2 South American kindreds ) . We identified heterozygous variants in 11 kin - dreds , including one ( p . Gln2208X ) that we observed in two unrelated families ( HCS - 09 and HCS - 14 ) . All identified variants are predicted to lead to premature termination ( Table 1 ) . We confirmed mutations as de novo events in six of the seven cases without a family history of HCS ( parental samples for HCS - 11 were not available ) . We confirmed transmission and co - segregation with the disease phenotype in the four kindreds with multiple affected individuals ( Table 1 and Fig . 1b ) . We detected none of the observed mutations in 300 unrelated , Mutations in NOTCH2 cause Hajdu - Cheney syndrome , a disorder of severe and progressive bone loss Michael A Simpson 1 , 14 , Melita D Irving 1 , 2 , 14 , Esra Asilmaz 1 , Mary J Gray 3 , Dimitra Dafou 1 , Frances V Elmslie 4 , Sahar Mansour 4 , Sue E Holder 5 , Caroline E Brain 6 , Barbara K Burton 7 , Katherine H Kim 7 , Richard M Pauli 8 , Salim Aftimos 9 , Helen Stewart 10 , Chong Ae Kim 11 , Muriel Holder - Espinasse 12 , Stephen P Robertson 3 , William M Drake 13 & Richard C Trembath 1 1 Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine , King’s College London School of Medicine , Guy’s Hospital , London , UK . 2 Clinical Genetics , Guy’s and St .

We sequenced all remaining coding exons and associated splice sites of NOTCH2 in the single subject in whom we did not detect any variation in exon 34 , but we did not observe any additional variants within this gene nor did we detect evidence of abnormal copy number of or within NOTCH2 as assessed by quantitative PCR ( data not shown ) . In total , we investigated 15 HCS kindreds and identified mutations in 14 of them ( ~ 93 % ) . The affected individual in whom we did not identify a NOTCH2 protein - altering variant may be considered atypi - cal , with no evidence of acro - osteolysis at seven years of age . This case may therefore represent a phenocopy of HCS , be explained by locus heterogeneity in HCS or be caused by an HCS allele comprising a noncoding or undetected coding variant in NOTCH2 . Four Notch receptors have been described in humans . All are sin - gle - pass transmembrane receptors that have high levels of structural similarity , share multiple ligands and have been shown to play a role in development , including skeletogenesis 5 . Following stimulation of Notch receptors , the Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) and extracel - lular domain are cleaved . The NICD translocates to the nucleus where it mediates transcriptional activation and repression 6 . The C terminus of the NOTCH2 intracellular domain contains a PEST sequence known to mediate proteosomal destruction of the protein 7 . Importantly , all identified HCS alleles are predicted to lead to premature termination of the protein product before the complete translation of the PEST domain . Sequencing of the NOTCH2 transcript in the probands from pedigrees HCS - 01 and HCS - 04 ( heterozygous for c . 6272delT and c . 6387delT , respectively ) confirmed the presence of both mutant and wild - type transcripts . We used a semiquantitative RT - PCR approach to show that the level of expression for two of the HCS alleles was comparable to that of wild - type alleles and that total abundance of the NOTCH2 transcript was equivalent to that in wild - type controls ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . We interpreted these findings to be in keep - ing with the established notion that nonsense mutations in the termi - nal exon of many genes have reduced capacity to activate the process of nonsense - mediated decay 8 . Indeed , we were able to detect a protein of the size of the predicted truncated NOTCH2 intracellular domain in primary skin fibroblasts from HCS - 01 heterozygous for the muta - tion resulting in p . Phe2091Ser fs X4 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Taken together , these findings suggest that HCS alleles generate a mature NOTCH2 protein product that contains a disrupted or absent pro - teolytic PEST sequence . Notably , prior in vitro studies using a Notch - sensitive luciferase reporter assay have shown that NOTCH2 receptors with partial or complete deletion of the PEST domain generated an elevated level of Notch signaling compared to wild - type constructs 9 . PEST domains are known to promote the degradation of proteins that contain them , with the elevated activity of Notch mutants lacking the PEST domain resulting from an increase in the half - life of the NICD , leading to a persistence of the Notch intracellular signal 10 . Mutations in NOTCH2 have previously been observed in two kin - dreds with Alagille syndrome 11 ( ALGS , MIM610205 ) , a multisystem monogenic disorder in which the majority of affected subjects har - bor mutations in the gene encoding the Notch ligand JAG1 . Skeletal manifestations , typically vertebral deformi - ties , are often observed in individuals with ALGS , although none of these features were reported in the individuals with ALGS with NOTCH2 mutations . It is noteworthy that renal cysts , typically a minor feature of ALGS but commonly seen in HCS , were observed in all individuals with ALGS with NOTCH2 mutations . The ALGS alleles of NOTCH2 are predicted to have distinct functional conse - quences to the HCS alleles we now report . That is , these two ALGS mutations are pre - dicted to inhibit the activity of NOTCH2 sig - naling , a mechanism consistent with reduced Notch signaling that results from JAG1 alleles that also underlie ALGS 11 , 12 . NOTCH2 pays an essential role during devel - opment .

This widespread expression pattern has the potential to explain the multisystem nature of the HCS phenotype . However , the char - acteristic and most debilitating clinical features of HCS are the skeletal abnormalities . There is growing evidence for the importance of NOTCH2 in the development and maintenance of the skeleton 5 , and this protein has been shown to modulate RANKL - induced osteoclastogenesis 14 . Overactivation of this pathway by HCS alleles may be responsible for the progressive bone loss observed in HCS . In summary , we have shown that a restricted range of mutations in the terminal exon of NOTCH2 underlie HCS , a disorder associated with severe and progressive osteoporosis . These findings show the critical role of NOTCH2 signaling in the regulation of bone mass , a position further supported by the recent association of common variants in JAG1 with bone mineral density and osteoporotic frac - tures 15 . Although additional studies will be required to explore the consequences of HCS alleles on osteoblast and osteoclast activity , these findings highlight the Notch pathway as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in osteoporosis .
