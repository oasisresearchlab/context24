Strong binding is observed to vesi - cles containing 10 % PIP 2 ( apparent K d (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) M ) . Detect - able but weak binding ( (cid:1) 10 - fold lower affinity than PIP 2 ) is observed for vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) . Vesicles containing phosphatidyl - inositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PI [ 3 , 4 ] P 2 ) and phosphatidyl - inositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) bind with affinities 2 - to 5 - fold lower than those containing PIP 2 . Thus , although the B motif binds PIP 2 with the highest affinity of the lipids tested , the specificity of this interac - tion is relatively low . Given that PIP 2 is estimated to be present in biological membranes at concentrations 20 - to 100 - fold higher than these other bis - and tris - phos - phoinositide species , PIP 2 is likely to be the relevant ligand in vivo ( Cantley , 2002 ; Czech , 2000 ; Fruman et Figure 1 .

We found that the binding of the N - WASP B motif is also highly dependent on PIP 2 DC1 / ) . Binding was monitored via fluorescence change of a 7 - diethylamino - 3 - ( 4’ - maleimidylphenyl ) - 4 - methyl - density . We repeated our quantitative binding experi - ments but used vesicle preparations containing either coumarin ( CPM ) ( Wang et al . , 1999 ) fluorophore - labeled protein upon addition of vesicles ( phosphatidyl choline 10 % or 2 % PIP 2 ( Figure 3A ) . The observed apparent affinity is (cid:1) 10 - fold higher when PIP 2 is present at 10 % [ PC ] , phosphatidyl serine [ PS ] , and the relevant phos - phoinositide species at ratios of 70 : 20 : 10 ) . vs . 2 % of total lipid ( K d (cid:1) 1 . 2 (cid:2) M versus 10 (cid:2) M ) . A direct way to examine PIP 2 density dependence is No detectable binding of the B - GBD fragment is ob - served to vesicles containing only PC / PS ( 80 : 20 ) or to to measure binding as a function of mol % of PIP 2 , a N - WASP Acts as Sensor of PIP 2 Density 183 metric for lipid surface density within a membrane ( Fig - ure 3B ) . This type of assay differs from our previous ones in that total lipid concentration is held constant , and only mole fraction of PIP 2 is varied . When PIP 2 bind - ing is assayed in this way , binding of a PIP 2 - specific PH domain—the domain from PLC - (cid:3) —still shows a typical hyperbolic binding isotherm indicative of noncoopera - tive binding in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry . However , a fragment of N - WASP containing the B region shows a sigmoidal binding isotherm indicative of cooperative binding ( Fig - ure 3C ) . This curve can be fit to an apparent Hill coeffi - cient ( n H ) of (cid:1) 3 , similar to the binding stoichiometry observed in studies of the MARCKS basic effector do - main ( McLaughlin et al . , 2002 ) . Another way to assess the effect of PIP 2 density is to alter lipid clustering . Cholesterol is thought to promote formation of lipid membrane subdomains ( Sandhoff et al . , 1999 ) and should increase the local PIP 2 density ( Pike and Miller , 1998 ; Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . Vesi - cles doped with 40 % cholesterol bound tighter to the B region ( Figure3C ) . Vesiclesdopedwith40 % cholesterol / 20 % sphingomyelin also showed a higher apparent af - finity ( V . P . , unpublished data ) . This multivalent mode of PIP 2 binding helps to clarify previous unexplained observations that soluble PIP 2 or IP 3 headgroup did not activate N - WASP , even when present at extremely high molar concentrations ( K . E . P . , unpublisheddata ) . ThesolublePIP 2 derivativesprobably cannot bind and activate N - WASP because they are not presented in a multivalent manner as is the case with PIP 2 in a membrane . N - WASP Actin Polymerization Activity Shows a Threshold Dependence on PIP 2 Density The above binding studiessuggested that N - WASP acti - vation might also be highly sensitive to the density of PIP 2 . We therefore measured the in vitro activity of N - WASP ( stimulationof Arp2 / 3 - mediatedactin polymer - ization ) as a function of mol % PIP 2 in a pyrene actin polymerization assay .

Autoinhibitory Interactions Amplify the Sharpness cooperativity of PIP 2 binding by mN - WASP was only slightly higher ( n H (cid:1) 3 . 8 ) than that observed for binding of PIP 2 Binding / Activation Threshold The above results reveal that both B motif membrane by the B - GBD fragment alone ( n H (cid:1) 3 . 1 ) . However , if the Arp2 / 3 complex is also added in stoichiometric binding and mN - WASP activation show a cooperative dependence on PIP 2 density . However , the sharpness amounts , then the cooperativity of PIP 2 binding ( n H (cid:1) 17 ) increases to nearly match the cooperativity of PIP 2 - ofthemN - WASPactivationprofileisconsiderablyhigher than that of the B region binding profile ( binding n H (cid:1) mediated activation ( n H (cid:1) 18 ) . Thus , the autoinhibitory interactions , particularly the interaction of the B motif (cid:1) 3 ; activation n H (cid:1) (cid:1) 20 ) . Moreover , the midpoint of the activation occurs at higher mol % of PIP 2 for mN - WASP with the Arp2 / 3 complex , appear to sharpen the overall PIP 2 binding and activation thresholds , consistent with activation than for B motif binding . These differences may be explained by the fact that in regulated N - WASP the above model . These competing autoinhibitory inter - actions also shift the midpoint of the binding / activation constructs , theBmotifisoccludedbycompetingautoin - hibitory interactions , causing the apparent affinity of threshold to higher mol % PIP 2 . PIP 2 binding to be lower . Moreover , if the autoinhibitory interactions occlude multiple adjacent PIP 2 binding Costimulation with Cdc42 Lowers PIP 2 Activation Threshold Point sites , then the cooperativity of PIP 2 binding might be higher—binding of one PIP 2 molecule to the basic motif We also examined how the presence of low levels of Cdc42 affects PIP 2 activation ( Figure 5 ) . We used 0 . 3 would disrupt competing autoinhibitory interactions , thereby increasing the apparent affinity of subsequent (cid:2) M Cdc42 , which by itself only yields (cid:4) 0 . 05 fractional activation of mN - WASP ( see Figure 3D ) .

A simple test of this hypothesis is to directly measure tion profile in the presence of this constant low amount of Cdc42 shows both a decrease in the midpoint of PIP 2 binding in the presence of competing autoinhibitory interactions—thoseoftheB - GBDfragmentwiththeVCA activation and a decrease in threshold sharpness .

These results are consistent with the model that the number of basic residues determines the multivalency of PIP 2 Changing Number of Basic Residues Can Tune N - WASP Sensitivity to PIP 2 binding sites in N - WASP , which , in turn , can modulate the activation threshold sharpness . In principle , such threshold activation behavior could be retuned by simply altering the multivalent nature of the core PIP 2 binding motif .

Moreover , just as in the in vitro actin polymerization assays , the threshold for motility activation with the 14K protein was sharper and occurred at lower mol % PIP 2 ( Figure 6E ) . In addition , at saturation ( high PIP 2 ) , the median length ofvesicletailswassignificantlylongerforthe14K - driven vesicles than the wt - driven vesicles . Similar threshold behavior was observed when using the number of motile vesicles as a metric for activity , although at PIP 2 densi - ties well above the activation threshold , the number of motile vesicles was observed to decline slightly . Overall , these data are consistent with the idea that B motif mutations directly alter motility by altering sensitivity to PIP 2 activation . Increasing the Number of Basic Residues Results in Increased N - WASP Activity in Resting Cells Overexpression of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 5 - phosphate kinase ( PIP5K ) , which catalyzes the con - version of PI ( 4 ) P to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , has been shown to induce vesicle rocketing in vivo ( Benesch et al . , 2002 ; Rozelle et al . , 2000 ) . This vesicle motility is dependent on N - WASP—it is not observed in knockout cells—and is consistent with a model in which an increase in steady - state PIP 2 level results in N - WASP activation . Rocketing vesicles show actin comet tails associated with mem - brane localized N - WASP . We employed this assay to examine whether our PIP 2 hypersensitive N - WASP mutant ( 14K ) , displayed altered vesicle rocketing behavior . Cultured N - WASP (cid:7) / (cid:7) mouse fibroblast cells ( Snapper et al . , 2001 ) were transiently transfected with either wild - type or 14K N - WASP ( full Figure 7 . N - WASP Hypersensitivity to PIP 2 In Vitro Correlates with Increased N - WASP Activity in Resting Cells length ) . In addition , we determined the effects of co - Fixed N - WASP (cid:7) / (cid:7) cells transfected with the following constructs : transfecting these cells with PIP5K .

See Supple - able N - WASP - associated actin comet tails ( Figure 7A ) , mental Movies 1 and 2 . 43 . 6 % of cells expressing 14K N - WASP exhibited N - WASP - associated actin tails ( Figure 7B ) . A movie of these rocketing vesicles in cells transfected with 14K Discussion N - WASP or wt N - WASP and GFP - actin is shown in sup - plemental movies ( Supplemental Movie 1 and Supple - N - WASP Polybasic Region Confers mental Movie 2 , respectively ) . These results suggest Switch - like Sensitivity to PIP 2 that the 14K N - WASP activation profile is altered such These results reveal that , in vitro , the actin regulatory that a significant amount of N - WASP activation now switch N - WASP responds to changes in PIP 2 density in occurs even at resting PIP 2 levels in vivo . The higher a switch - like manner : the transition from the fully re - threshold activation midpoint for wt N - WASP may effec - pressed state to the fully activated state occurs above a sharp threshold . This threshold behavior appears to tively suppress this basal activation . Molecular Cell 188 be the result of two key features of N - WASP . First , the polybasic region of N - WASP recognizes PIP 2 in a multivalent manner . Second , because the basic motif in N - WASP is also involved in regulatory autoinhibitory interactions in the repressed state , the sharpness of the PIP 2 - dependent activation transition is strongly ampli - fied . Together , these two levels of cooperativity yield a PIP 2 activation profile with an apparent Hill coefficient of (cid:1) 18 . Cooperative activation has many examples in biology . For example , hemoglobin uses a homotropic allosteric mechanism to bind to O 2 in a manner sharply dependent of O 2 partial pressure ( n H (cid:1) (cid:1) 3 ) ( Perutz , 1978 ) . MAP kinase cascades in Xenopus oocytes appear to use sev - eral mechanisms to yield an all - or - none dose response curve ( n H (cid:1) 35 ) ( Ferrell and Machleder , 1998 ) . Such mechanisms include successive steps of distributive multisite phosphorylation and positive feedback . Here , we have observed a different mechanism that allows N - WASP to respond in an extremely sharp manner to Figure 8 . Steep Activation Profile of N - WASP May Balance Damp - ening of Activity under Quiescent Conditions with Sensitive Activa - PIP 2 densities . tion upon Subtle Input Perturbations Underquiescentconditions ( noactivatedCdc42butbasaldensityof Noise Filtration : Possible Role of PIP 2 PIP 2 ) , the threshold behavior of N - WASP could suppress activation . Activation Threshold However , if quiescent densities of PIP 2 are set sufficiently close to One functionof such cooperative activationprofiles may the activation threshold , then N - WASP would be highly sensitive to be to act as a signal filter that suppresses “leaky” activa - activation by several possible mechanisms : small increases in PIP 2 density ( (cid:4) 2 - fold ) from an increase in synthesis , decrease in decay , tion at input doses below the threshold . This property or membrane reorganization could lead to full activation of N - WASP could be particularly important for detection of PIP 2 as ( left ) . Alternatively , asmallincreasein Cdc42couldactivate byshift - an activatingsignal . Unlike other keysignaling phospho - ing the activation threshold to lower mol % PIP 2 . If this shift is below inositides , PIP 2 is always present in the plasma mem - normal levels of PIP 2 , then full activation would occur . Activation , brane at relatively high concentrations , even under qui - in this case , would still be targeted specifically to the PIP 2 - rich escent conditions . PIP 2 levels are estimated to be (cid:1) 5 – 10 plasma membrane . Activation could also occur through a combina - tion of increase in PIP 2 density and activated Cdc42 levels . (cid:2) M and may vary by only (cid:8) 50 % ( 0 . 5 - to 1 . 5 - fold ) upon active signaling ( Cantley , 2002 ; Lemmon and Ferguson , 2000 ; McLaughlin et al . , 2002 ; Xu et al . , 2003 ) . In con - properties observed from in vitro actin polymerization trast , the levels of PIP 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 change significantly assays correlate with behavior in vivo , particularly the from virtually undetectable in quiescent cells to (cid:1) 0 . 3 threshold setpoint in vivo . Nonetheless , our assays of (cid:2) M ( Cantley , 2002 ; Carpenter et al . , 1990 ) . Given this vesicle motility in cytoplasmic extracts , which reflect a (cid:9) 50 - fold increase ( Lemmon and Ferguson , 2000 ) , ef - significantly more complex actin - based signaling pro - fector proteins that bind PIP 3 by simple hyperbolic bind - cess , are consistent with a sharp PIP 2 activation thresh - ing can still exhibit a sharp signal - dependent recruit - old . Synthetic vesicle motility shows a threshold depen - ment and activation . In contrast , if a PIP 2 effector protein dence on mol % PIP 2 , and the midpoint and sharpness binds its ligand with a simple hyperbolic activation pro - of this transition is dependent on the charge density of file , then significant “noise” levels of activity would be the B region . Finally , in vivo endosome rocketing assays observedevenunder quiescentconditions . Ahyperbolic show that 14K N - WASP , which has an abnormally low response curve requires an (cid:1) 80 - fold increase in input PIP 2 activation threshold in vitro , can now be activated dose ( Koshland et al . , 1982 ) , a range that is not spanned even by basal levels of PIP 2 ( whereas wt remains inac - by physiologically observed fluctuations in the levels of tive ) . This observation supports a model in which the PIP 2 at the plasma membrane , to shift from 10 % to 90 % wild - type activation threshold is normally set just above fractional binding or activity . quiescent PIP 2 levels . The sharp threshold observed in N - WASP activation overcomes these problems : below the threshold , noise from quiescent levels of PIP 2 could be suppressed , Multiple Modes of N - WASP Activation The sharp activation profile of wild - type N - WASP would whereas high sensitivity to PIP 2 could be maintained at or above the threshold ( Figure 8 ) . The activation profile suppress activation under conditions of basal PIP 2 den - sity . Nonetheless , this profile would also leave N - WASP that we observe for mN - WASP requires only a (cid:1) 1 . 3 - fold change in mol % PIP 2 to transition from 10 % to 90 % sensitively poised for activation by several possible up - stream events . First , small increases in PIP 2 density activation . This small transition range is compatible with the small changes in PIP 2 density ( 0 . 5 - to 1 . 5 - fold ) that alone could trigger activation ( Figure 8 ) . Increases in PIP 2 density could occur through an increase in local are thought to occur upon signaling . It is also possible that sequestration of PIP 2 by other factors also contrib - PIP 2 synthesis , a decrease in its breakdown , or cluster - ing / segregation of PIP 2 into spatial domains . This poten - utes to noise filtration . It is difficult to determine precisely how the activation tial mode of activation may explain why overexpression N - WASP Acts as Sensor of PIP 2 Density 189 Cosendimentation Lipid Vesicle Binding Assays of PIP5 kinase , the enzyme that synthesizes PIP 2 , results Cosedimentation lipid vesicle binding assays ( Kavran et al . , 1998 ) in the spontaneous formation of numerous N - WASP - were performed by mixing 5 (cid:2) M protein and vesicles at a 20 (cid:2) M mediated actin comet tails ( Benesch et al . , 2002 ; Rozelle final phosphoinositide concentration in 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 100 et al . , 2000 ) .
