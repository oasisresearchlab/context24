The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in endocytosis , yet few molecules that link these sys - tems have been identiﬁed . Here , we have cloned and characterized mHip1R , a protein that is closely related to huntingtin interacting protein 1 ( Hip1 ) . These two proteins are mammalian homologues of Sla2p , an actin binding protein important for actin organization and endocytosis in yeast . Sequence alignments and second - ary structure predictions veriﬁed that mHip1R belongs to the Sla2 protein family . Thus , mHip1R contains an NH 2 - terminal domain homologous to that implicated in Sla2p’s endocytic function , three predicted coiled – coils , a leucine zipper , and a talin - like actin - binding domain at the COOH terminus . The talin - like domain of mHip1R binds to F - actin in vitro and colocalizes with F - actin in vivo , indicating that this activity has been conserved from yeast to mammals . mHip1R shows a punctate immunolocalization and is enriched at the cell cortex and in the perinuclear region . We concluded that the cortical localization represents endocytic compart - ments , because mHip1R colocalizes with clathrin , AP - 2 , and endocytosed transferrin , and because mHip1R fractionates biochemically with clathrin - coated vesicles . Time - lapse video microscopy of mHip1R – green ﬂuo - rescence protein ( GFP ) revealed a blinking behavior similar to that reported for GFP - clathrin , and an actin - dependent inward movement of punctate structures from the cell periphery . These data show that mHip1R is a component of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles and suggest that it might link the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton . Key words : actin • endocytosis • clathrin • Hunting - ton disease • vesicle E NDOCYTOSIS is important for receptor internaliza - tion , nutrient uptake , antigen presentation , patho - gen internalization , and maintenance of plasma membrane surface area ( for reviews see Riezman et al . , 1997 ; Marsh and McMahon , 1999 ) . Endocytosis occurs via several distinct pathways and requires coordinated inter - actions between a variety of molecules at the cell cortex . In yeast , a functional connection between the actin cyto - skeleton and endocytosis has been firmly established ( for reviews see Geli and Riezman , 1998 ; Wendland et al . , 1998 ) . Mutations in actin and in several actin - binding proteins in - hibit the internalization step of both receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis ( Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) . Furthermore , studies using actin mutants and cofilin mutants suggest that rapid actin filament turnover is required for endocytosis ( Lap - palainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ) . In mammalian cells , a role for actin in endocytosis has not been as clearly established . Cytochalasin - D , a drug that destabilizes actin filaments , inhibits apical endocytosis in polarized epithelial cells but has no effect on basolateral endocytosis ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Jackman et al . , 1994 ) . In other cell types , there are conflicting results on the effects of various actin - depolymerizing drugs on receptor - medi - ated endocytosis ( Salisbury et al . , 1980 ; Wolkoff et al . , 1984 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ; Lamaze et al . , 1996 , 1997 ) . Several functional roles for actin in endocytic processes have been proposed . The actin cytoskeleton might provide a force for vesicle budding , or it might mediate vesicle transport or fusion ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Merrifield et al . , 1999 ) . Alternatively , it might pro - vide a scaffold at the plasma membrane for the endocytic machinery ( Wendland et al . , 1998 ; Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . To gain further insight into the role of the actin cyto - skeleton in endocytosis , it is important to identify proteins that link the actin cytoskeleton to the endocytic machin - Address correspondence to David G .

In yeast , mutations of several actin - binding proteins cause defects in both endocytosis and in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . One such protein is Sla2p , which was first identified in a synthetic lethal screen against a null allele of ABP1 ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) , a gene encod - ing an actin - binding protein implicated in cytoskeletal reg - ulation , endocytosis , and cAMP signaling ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ; Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . Sla2p , also known as End4p and Mop2p , is a peripheral membrane protein that contains a novel NH 2 - terminal domain , three putative coiled – coil do - mains , a putative leucine zipper , and a COOH - terminal talin - like domain ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ; Na et al . , 1995 ; Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Sla2p binds to F - actin in vitro through the talin - like domain and partially colocalizes with F - actin in cortical patches ( Mc - Cann and Craig , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Interestingly , Sla2p localizes to the cell cortex in the presence of latrun - culin - A ( LAT - A ) , 1 indicating that Sla2p has an actin - inde - pendent cortical localization signal ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Sla2p has been implicated in endocytosis ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) , membrane protein maintenance ( Na et al . , 1995 ) , and vesicle trafficking ( Mulholland et al . , 1997 ) . Homologues of Sla2p have been identified in nematodes ( ZK370 . 3 ) and humans ( Hip1R ) ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Seki et al . , 1998 ) , but very little is known about their cellu - lar functions . In mammals , an additional isoform exists , the huntingtin interacting protein 1 ( Hip1 ) , which is pre - dominantly expressed in the brain ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ; Wanker et al . , 1997 ) . Huntington disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of the codon CAG in the huntingtin gene , which leads to expres - sion of a polyglutamine tract in the protein ( for reviews see Wellington et al . , 1997 ; Reddy et al . , 1999 ) . The affin - ity of the huntingtin protein – Hip1 interaction is inversely correlated to the polyglutamine length . Therefore , it has been speculated that loss of normal huntingtin – Hip1 inter - action might contribute to a defect in membrane – cytoskel - etal integrity in the brain ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ) . To learn more about the cellular function of the Sla2 family of pro - teins , we have initiated a study of the mouse homologue of Hip1R . Materials and Methods Cloning of mHip1R A mouse brain lambda ZAPII cDNA library ( # 936314 ; Stratagene ) was screened using a mouse expressed sequence tag ( EST ) obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection ( ESTm1 ; sequence data available from EMBL / GenBank / DDBJ under accession no . W82687 ) . 50 ng of a 1 . 3 - kb EcoRI / NcoI fragment of this EST was radioactively labeled with [ 32 P ] dCTP using random - priming . The probe was allowed to hybridize to filters containing (cid:46) 2 (cid:51) 10 5 pfu / ml of the mouse brain lambda ZAPII cDNA library , and incubated overnight at 65 (cid:56) C in Church buffer ( 0 . 5 M NaPO 4 , 7 % SDS , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) . The filters were washed at room temperature for 15 min with 2 (cid:51) SSPE ( 200 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 3 M NaCl , 25 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) containing 0 . 1 % SDS , then at 65 (cid:56) C for 20 min with 1 (cid:51) SSPE ( 200 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 3 M NaCl , 25 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) , contain - ing 0 . 1 % SDS , and finally twice at 65 (cid:56) C with 0 . 2 (cid:51) SSPE , containing 0 . 1 % SDS . The filters were exposed to X - ray film overnight at (cid:50) 70 (cid:56) C . Primary positives were isolated , replated , and subsequent secondary positives were hybridized and washed as for the primary screen . The resulting positive phage was converted into plasmid DNA by conventional methods ( Strat - agene ) and the cDNA ( 3 . 96 kb ) encoding mHip1R was isolated and com - pletely sequenced . DNA Constructions Two murine ESTs were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collec - tion , ESTm1 and ESTm2 ( sequence data available from EMBL / Gen - Bank / DDBJ under accession nos . W82687 and AA10840 , respectively ) . The plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced . These EST clones and the full - length mHip1R cDNA ( see above ) were used to generate the differ - ent constructs in this study . For the antibody production and for in vitro actin - binding assays , frag - ments of mHip1R were expressed as glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fu - sion proteins in E . coli . mHip1R ( amino acids [ aa ] 1015 – 1068 ) was ampli - fied by PCR using primers that generate NcoI and EcoRI sites at the 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) ends , respectively . mHip1R ( aa 766 – 1068 ) was amplified using primers that generate XhoI and HindIII sites at the 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) ends , respec - tively . The PCR products were cut with the above restriction enzymes and ligated into the pGAT2 vector ( a GST fusion derivative of pBAT ; Peränen et al . , 1996 ) . For expression of mHip1R constructs in mammalian cells , full - length protein ( aa 1 – 1068 ) and fragments of mHip1R were expressed as green fluorescence protein ( GFP ) fusions , or were expressed with a 6 myc - tag at the COOH terminus . mHip1R ( aa 1 – 1068 ) – GFP and mHip1R ( aa 1 – 324 ) – GFP were amplified by PCR using primers that generate NheI and SalI sites at the 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) ends , respectively . The PCR products were ligated into pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech , Inc . ) . The linker region created between mHip1R and GFP consists of the 14 aa QSTVPRARDPPVAT . mHip1R ( aa 1 – 1068 ) – GFP , mHip1R ( aa 346 – 1068 ) – GFP , and mHip1R ( aa 766 – 1068 ) – GFP were amplified by PCR using primers that generate XhoI and XbaI sites at the 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) ends , respectively . The PCR products were li - gated into pEGFP - C1 ( Clontech , Inc . ) . A linker region of 10 aa ( SGL - RSRAGGS ) was created between GFP and mHip1R . mHip1R ( aa 1 – 1068 ) – 6 myc , mHip1R ( aa 1 – 324 ) – 6 myc , mHip1R ( aa 1 – 655 ) – 6 myc , mHip1R ( aa 346 – 1068 ) – 6 myc , and mHip1R ( aa 766 – 1068 ) – 6 myc were amplified by PCR using primers that generate ClaI and NotI sites at the 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) ends , respectively . The PCR products were ligated into a 6 myc de - rivative of pIRESneo ( Clontech , Inc . ) . This vector was created by cloning a 6 myc - tag into the Not1 and BamH1 sites of the pIRESneo vector . This created a linker region between the mHip1R sequence and the 6 myc - tag consisting of 5 aa ( SRPQAM ) . A Kozac site including the ATG was added to constructs that do not contain the NH 2 terminus . All constructs were sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced during PCR . In addition , all constructs were tested for expression by Western blotting ( see below ) . Northern Blot Analysis of mHip1R mRNA Northern blot analyses of mHip1R mRNA levels were performed using blots containing either 2 (cid:109) g RNA per lane from eight different tissues or RNA from mouse embryos at four different embryonic stages ( Clontech , Inc . ) . A 297 - bp DNA fragment corresponding to mHip1R ( aa 970 – 1068 ) was amplified by PCR using ESTm1 as a template . To generate a probe , this DNA fragment was labeled with [ (cid:97) - 32 P ] CTP ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) using an oligonucleotide labeling kit which employs Klenow polymerase ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using MicroSpin S - 200 columns ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . 37 . 5 ng of the labeled probe ( sp act (cid:53) 8 (cid:51) 10 5 cpm / ng ) were used per blot . The blots were prehybridized in ExpressHyb solution ( Clontech , Inc . ) for 30 min at 68 (cid:56) C . The probe was then added to the prehybridized blots and incubated at 68 (cid:56) C for 1 . 5 h . The blots were then washed at room temperature three times for 1 min and three times for 10 min in 300 mM NaCl , 30 mM sodium citrate , pH 7 . 0 , containing 0 . 05 % SDS , and were subsequently washed at 50 (cid:56) C twice for 20 min with prewarmed 15 mM NaCl , 1 . 5 mM sodium citrate , pH 7 . 0 , containing 0 . 1 % SDS . mHip1R mRNAs were detected by exposing the blots for 7 – 8 d on autoradiography film . A probe derived from a human (cid:98) - actin cDNA ( Clontech , Inc . ) was used to control for RNA loading and integrity . Blots were reused after stripping them in 0 . 5 % SDS at 90 – 100 (cid:56) C for 10 min under frequent rocking . Com - pletion of stripping was verified by autoradiography .

Engqvist - Goldstein et al . Hip1R Endocytic and Cytoskeletal Protein 1505 at the COOH terminus of mHip1R ( aa 1032 – 1068 ) . mHip1R ( aa 1015 – 1068 ) was expressed as a GST fusion in E . coli . The protein was purified us - ing glutathione – affinity chromatography , cleaved with thrombin ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) and purified by gel filtration followed by HPLC . This pro - cedure yielded a degradation product of high purity ( aa 1032 – 1068 , as identified by mass spectrometry ) . This polypeptide was then conjugated to guinea pig albumin and mixed with Ribi adjuvant ( R - 700 ; Ribi Immu - noChem Research , Inc . ) for injection into Hartley guinea pigs ( 100 (cid:109) g protein per injection ) . After the initial injection , boosts were given every 3 – 4 wk . The crude sera were screened against 0 . 5 – 500 ng of purified mHip1R ( aa 765 – 1068 ) and against mouse tissue homogenates by immu - noblotting . After five injections , the crude antiserum was purified by af - finity chromatograpy as described by Kozminski et al . ( 2000 ) . In brief , mHip1R ( aa 1015 – 1068 ) – GST was conjugated to Reacti - Gel™ ( Pierce ) following the manufacturer’s instructions , and poured into a column . The column was washed and the crude serum was circulated through the col - umn overnight . After extensive washing , the antiserum was eluted with 0 . 05 M Tris - HCl , 4 . 5 M MgCl 2 , 1 mg / ml BSA , pH 7 . 4 . This antibody is re - ferred to as GP # 8 . Immunoblot Analysis of mHip1R Tissues for Western blotting were harvested from adult female Swiss Webster mice and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen . The different tis - sues and organs were minced using a razor blade , and homogenized at 4 (cid:56) C using a dounce glass homogenizer ( size AA ; (cid:122) 20 strokes ) . For homogeni - zation , 3 ml / g tissue homogenization buffer A ( 250 mM sucrose , 10 mM EGTA , 2 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail A ( 10 (cid:109) g / ml leupeptin , 10 (cid:109) g / ml aprotinin , 10 (cid:109) g / ml soybean trypsin inhibitors , and 1 mM PMSF ) was used . The samples were centri - fuged at 4 (cid:56) C for 20 min at 4 , 000 rpm in a microcentrifuge . The resulting supernatants were used for Western blot analysis , in which equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane . Cell line homogenates were prepared by growing cells to confluence , rinsing the cells with ice - cold PBS , scraping the cells off the plates , collect - ing them by centrifugation , and lysing the cell pellets in ice cold homoge - nization B ( 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % NP - 40 , 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 ) supplemented with the protease inhibitor cocktail A at 350 (cid:109) l / 5 (cid:51) 10 6 cells . The crude homogenate was then dounced as described above , and spun for 5 min at 5 , 000 rpm at 4 (cid:56) C in a microcentrifuge . SDS - PAGE was performed and proteins were transferred to nitrocel - lulose membranes in transfer buffer containing 0 . 05 % SDS . Membranes were then blocked for 1 . 5 h with TBS / 0 . 05 % Tween 20 containing 5 % nonfat milk , followed by incubation with affinity - purified anti - mHip1R antiserum . The primary antibodies were visualized using HRP - conjugated anti – guinea pig secondary antibodies ( ICN Pharmaceuticals , Inc . ) and en - hanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . In Vitro Actin - binding Assay The talin - like domain of mHip1R ( aa 766 – 1068 ) was expressed as a GST fusion in E . coli Bl21 ( DE3 ) cells using the pGAT2 plasmid constructs de - scribed above . Cultures were grown to OD 600 (cid:53) 0 . 5 and expression was induced by addition of 0 . 4 mM isopropyl - thio - (cid:98) - D - galactoside ( IPTG ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) . Cells were lysed by one freeze – thaw cycle , followed by sonication ( six times for 20 s ) in PBS containing 10 mM EGTA and 0 . 5 mM PMSF . The GST fusion protein was purified using glutathione – affinity chromatography as described by Ausubel et al . ( 1994 ) . The puri - fied GST – talin - like domain was then used in an actin filament cosedimen - tation assay . Actin filaments were assembled as described by Goode et al . ( 1999 ) with minor alterations . In brief , 0 . 1 vol of 10 (cid:51) initiation mix ( 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 M KCl , 5 mM ATP ) was added to human nonmuscle mono - meric actin ( Cytoskeleton ) in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) , and was then incubated for 30 min at 20 (cid:56) C . The cosedimentation assays were performed using 50 - (cid:109) l reactions containing 1 . 25 – 10 (cid:109) M (cid:97) - actin and 1 . 5 (cid:109) M GST – talin - like domain . The mixtures were centrifuged for 25 min at 90 , 000 rpm at 20 (cid:56) C in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman ) . Pellets and supernatants were resuspended in SDS sam - ple buffer and equal volumes were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , followed by Coomassie blue staining . Protein amounts was quantified using an IS - 100 densitometer ( Alpha Innotech Corp . ) . Cell Culture NIH / 3T3 , COS - 7 , and MDCK cells were maintained in DME ( GIBCO BRL ) containing 10 % FBS . Indirect Immunofluorescence Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with 50 mM MES , pH 6 . 1 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM EGTA , 5 mM glucose , and were then incubated with 3 – 4 % formaldehyde , 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in the same buffer for 35 – 45 min . The fixed cells were quenched with 1 mg / ml NaBH 4 ( twice for 10 min ) to pre - vent autofluorescence , and then blocked and permeabilized with TBS ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 154 mM NaCl , 2 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) contain - ing 2 % BSA and 0 . 02 % saponin for 1 . 5 h . The coverslips were then incu - bated on 20 - (cid:109) l droplets of primary antibody diluted in TBS / BSA / saponin overnight . The following primary antibodies were used : polyclonal anti - GFP antibody ( kindly provided by Dr . Pam Silver , Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) ; polyclonal anti - mHip1R ( see above ) ; monoclonal anti – AP - 2 antibody ( AP - 6 ) and monoclonal an - ticlathrin antibody ( X22 ) ( Affinity Bioreagents ) ; monoclonal anticlathrin antibody ( Transduction Laboratories ) ; monoclonal anti - paxillin antibody ( Transduction Laboratories ) ; polyclonal anti - Abp1 antibody ( Kessels et al . , 2000 ) ; and monoclonal anti - myc antibody 9E10 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy ) . After incubation with the primary antibodies , the coverslips were washed three times for 15 min with TBS / BSA / saponin , and incubated with the secondary antibodies in TBS / BSA / saponin for 1 . 5 h . The following secondary antibodies were used : FITC goat anti – guinea pig ( ICN Pharma - ceuticals , Inc . ) ; rhodamine goat anti – guinea pig ( ICN Pharmaceuticals , Inc . ) ; FITC donkey anti – mouse ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laborato - ries ) ; rhodamine donkey anti – mouse ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab - oratories ) ; FITC goat anti – rabbit ( ICN Pharmaceuticals , Inc . ) ; and rhodamine sheep anti – rabbit ( Cappel ) , and / or rhodamine - phalloidin ( Mo - lecular Probes ) . After incubation in secondary antibodies , the coverslips were washed in TBS / BSA / saponin ( 15 min ) and with TBS ( twice for 15 min ) . After removing excess buffer , the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using VectaShield mounting medium containing 4 , 6 - diami - dino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( Vector , Inc . ) , sealed with nail pol - ish , and viewed using an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 fluorescence mi - croscope or with a Zeiss 510 confocal laser scanning microscope . For epifluorescence microscopy , images were captured using a cooled CCD Hamamatsu ORCA camera and were recorded digitally ( ImageProPlus ; Phase3 Imaging Systems ) . For confocal microscopy , images were captured using Zeiss 510 software . All images were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop software . Transferrin Uptake Assay COS - 7 cells grown on glass coverslips were serum starved for 45 min at 37 (cid:56) C in DME . Cells were then incubated with 25 (cid:109) g / ml human transferrin conjugated to Texas red ( Molecular Probes ) in serum - free media for 1 h at 4 (cid:56) C . Subsequently , the coverslips were washed three times for 5 min with ice - cold PBS , and then fixed with an ice - cold solution of 4 % formalde - hyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde ( 0 min ) or warmed to 37 (cid:56) C for 2 , 5 , 10 , 15 , or 30 min before they were washed and fixed as described above . The fixed cells were then incubated with anti - mHip1R antibody , followed by FITC anti – guinea pig antibody and were examined by confocal micros - copy as described above . Transfection of COS - 7 Cells with mHip1R Constructs First , the expression of GFP fusion proteins and myc - tagged proteins was verified by immunoblotting . Cells were plated at 300 , 000 cells / well ( 6 - well plates ) on glass coverslips , 24 h before transfection . Transfections were performed using the lipofectamine method according to the manufacturer ( GIBCO BRL ) . Typically , 1 (cid:109) g of DNA per 1 ml transfection medium was used , and transfections were performed for 5 h at 37 (cid:56) C . The solution was then replaced by complete medium ( DME containing 10 % FBS ) and cells were harvested 48 h after transfection . Homogenization buffer ( see above ) containing 1 % Triton X - 100 was added directly to the 6 - well plates and cells were scraped off and homogenized using a 25 - gauge needle . Cells were then centrifuged at 15 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 (cid:56) C in a microcen - trifuge . The resulting pellets and supernatants were analyzed by immuno - blotting using polyclonal anti - GFP antibodies or monoclonal anti - myc an - tibodies . Second , subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins and myc - tagged proteins was determined by indirect immunofluorescence . Cells were transfected as described above and processed for immunofluorescence 24 – 36 h after transfection as described above . Constructs used in these ex - periments are described above . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1506 Subcellular Fractionation and Purification of Clathrin - coated Vesicles For subcellular fractionation , 0 . 7 – 0 . 8 g of mouse brain was homogenized in homogenization buffer A ( 250 mM sucrose , 10 mM EGTA , 2 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ) containing the protease inhibitor cocktail A ( 1 : 1 wt / vol ) and spun at 3 , 000 g for 20 min . P1 contains unbroken cells , nu - clei , mitochondria , and large plasma membrane pieces . The supernatants ( S1 ) were collected and spun at 25 , 000 g for 30 min to generate P2 ( small plasma membrane pieces , ER , and endosomes ) and S2 . Supernatant S2 was spun at 176 , 000 g for 1 h to generate P3 ( light microsomes and small vesicles ) and S3 ( soluble proteins ) . For extraction experiments , P2 was re - suspended in homogenization buffer A containing either 1 % Triton X - 100 or 0 . 5 M NaCl . After incubation on ice for 30 min , the fractions were spun at 25 , 000 g for 30 min . The protein concentration of each fraction was de - termined by the Bradford method ( 1976 ) . Equal amounts of protein were examined by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Purification of clathrin - coated vesicles was performed as described by Lindner ( 1998 ) with minor alterations . In brief , 10 mouse brains ( (cid:122) 5 g ) ( Pel Freez Biologicals ) were minced using a razor blade and homogenized in 5 ml buffer C ( 0 . 1 M MES , 1 . 0 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 6 . 5 ) con - taining the protease inhibitor cocktail A . Postmitochondrial supernatants ( S1 ) were spun at 120 , 000 g in a Type70 rotor ( Beckman ) for 50 min at 4 (cid:56) C to prepare a microsomal pellet ( P2 ) . P2 was resuspended in 0 . 4 ml buffer C containing the protease inhibitor cocktail A and homogenized by 10 – 15 strokes in a Potter - Elvehjem device . The resuspended P2 was mixed with 0 . 4 ml 12 . 5 % ficoll – sucrose solution and spun at 43 , 000 g in a TLA100 . 3 rotor ( Beckman ) for 40 min at 4 (cid:56) C . The resulting supernatant ( S3 ) was mixed with 1 . 8 ml buffer C containing the protease inhibitor cocktail A and subsequently spun at 125 , 000 g in a TLA100 . 3 rotor for 30 min at 4 (cid:56) C . The pellet ( V ) , which contains the enriched clathrin - coated vesicles , was resuspended in 100 (cid:109) l buffer C . The S4 fraction was TCA - precipitated and resuspended in the same volume as the pellet ( V ) . Samples were ana - lyzed by SDS - PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining and by West - ern blotting as described above . Equivalent portions of P1 , S1 , P2 , and S2 , corresponding to (cid:122) 0 . 02 % of each fraction , were loaded on the gel . For S3 , P3 , S4 , and V , equivalent portions corresponding to (cid:122) 2 % of the fraction were loaded . Figure 1 . Analysis of mHip1R sequence .

Hip1R Endocytic and Cytoskeletal Protein 1507 The following antibodies were used in the above experiments : poly - clonal anti – amphiphysin II antibody ( kindly provided by Harvey T . McMahon , Medical Research Council Laboratories , Cambridge , UK ) ; polyclonal anti - mHip1R antibody ; monoclonal anticlathrin antibody ( Trans - duction Laboratories ) ; monoclonal antipaxillin antibody ( Transduction Laboratories ) ; polyclonal anti - Abp1 antibody ; polyclonal eps15 antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnologies ) ; monoclonal antiactin antibody C4 ( ICN Pharmaceuticals , Inc . ) ; polyclonal anti - BiP 1 ( StressGen Biotech Corp . ) ; and monoclonal anti - syntaxin 1 ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) . Imaging of mHip1R - GFP in Living Cells NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with mHip1R ( aa 1 – 1068 ) – GFP as described above . The coverslips were transferred to F - 12 media ( GIBCO BRL ) containing 5 % FCS and 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 . Cells expressing low to medium levels of GFP fusion protein were imaged using an inverted Ni - kon Eclipse TE300 fluorescence microscope with a Nikon Plan Apo ( 1 . 4 NA ) 100 (cid:51) objective and a Hamamatsu ORCA cooled CCD camera . GFP fluorescence was visualized with 1 . 5 – 20 s exposures using a B - 2E / C ( FITC ) filter set ( Nikon ) . During the experiments , the coverslips were maintained at 37 (cid:56) C using an aluminum chamber connected to a circulating water bath . The light was shuttered to reduce photobleaching when exposure times were (cid:46) 2 s . For observation of LAT - A treatments , media containing 2 (cid:109) M LAT - A were added to the chamber . For observation of detergent - extracted cells , 0 . 05 vol of Triton X - 100 ( 20 % vol / vol ) were added to cells at frame 5 – 10 of continuous time - lapse recording ( 1 . 5 s per frame ) and observed for (cid:122) 1 min . Results Identification and Sequence Analysis of a Mouse Homologue of Yeast Sla2p To identify mammalian homologues of yeast Sla2p , we performed a database search . Several EST clones from mouse and human were identified that encoded either Hip1 or a novel protein related to Hip1 . Different EST clones for this novel protein were obtained and sequenced . ESTm1 was used to screen a mouse brain lambda ZAPII cDNA library , and an (cid:122) 4 kb cDNA was subsequently identified . This cDNA contains a 3 , 204 - kb open reading frame predicted to encode a 119 . 5 - kD protein ( 1068 aa ) . Sequence alignments of this open reading frame with other Sla2 - related proteins from different organisms re - vealed that it is highly homologous ( 91 % identity over the entire aa sequence ) to the recently identified protein Hip1R ( human Hip1 - related ; Seki et al . , 1998 ) ( Fig . 1 a ) . Because of the high identity and the similarity in tissue dis - tribution between these two proteins ( see below ) , we be - lieve that the novel Sla2 - related protein we identified is Figure 2 .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1508 the mouse ortholog of human Hip1R . Therefore , we de - cided to call it mHip1R . However , one major difference between these two proteins exists within the NH 2 - terminal domain : Seki et al . ( 1998 ) selected a start codon (cid:122) 180 aa downstream from the start codon we selected . It is likely that these aa are part of the translated coding sequence , because they show strong homology to the first half of the NH 2 - terminal domain that is highly conserved among Sla2 - related proteins ( Fig . 1 b ) . mHip1R shows 24 – 60 % identity to the other Sla2 - related proteins in this domain . Additionally , we identified a Kozac translational initiation consensus sequence at the start codon that we favor . Fi - nally , the human clone identified by Ishikawa et al . ( 1998 ) also contains the full NH 2 - terminal domain . However , it remains possible that different spliced variants of Hip1R exists in humans , which may explain the truncation of the NH 2 - terminal domain in hHip1R reported by Seki et al . ( 1998 ) . As shown in Fig . 1 c , the domain structure and predicted coiled – coil domains of mHip1R are similar to those of all other Sla2 - related proteins . However , in contrast to Sla2p , mHip1R does not contain a proline - rich region or a glutamine - rich region . These regions also do not appear in Sla2 - related proteins from nematodes , mice , or humans . mHip1R Is Ubiquitously Expressed in Mouse Tissues Northern blot analysis of mouse embryos showed that mHip1R mRNA levels do not change appreciably during development ( Fig . 2 a ) . Furthermore , the mRNA is de - tected in all tissues tested , although the levels are lower in skeletal muscle and heart ( Fig . 2 b ) . This is in contrast to hHip1 mRNA , which is highly enriched in the brain ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ) , but it is consistent with results from Ishikawa et al . ( 1998 ) and Seki et al . ( 1998 ) , who showed by RT - PCR that hHip1R is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues . The size of the mHip1R mRNA was (cid:122) 5 kb and varies slightly in different tissues ( Fig . 2 , a and b ) . In addition , an (cid:122) 2 - kb band was detected during the early stage of embryonic development ( Fig . 2 a ) . Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the extreme COOH terminus of mHip1R ( aa 1032 – 1068 ) , which is a re - gion that is not conserved between any of the known Sla2 - related proteins . Our affinity - purified antibody detected a band of (cid:122) 120 kD in all cell lines and tissues tested on Western blots ( Fig . 2 , e and f ) . The mHip1R signal in skel - etal muscle is extremely low ( Fig . 2 f ) , which corresponds well with the mRNA levels detected by Northern blotting . Furthermore , the size of this protein corresponds to the molecular weight predicted for mHip1R . This band was not detected with preimmune serum or with anti - mHip1R sera preincubated with the antigen ( data not shown ) . The Talin - like Domain of mHip1R Binds F - Actin In Vitro McCann and Craig ( 1997 ) showed that yeast Sla2p binds to F - actin in vitro through the talin - like domain . They named this domain the I / LWEQ module due to the pres - ence of several conserved residues ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) . To test whether this binding activity is conserved in mHip1R , the talin - like domain ( aa 766 – 1068 ) was ex - pressed in E . coli as a GST fusion and tested for actin binding in an F - actin pelleting assay ( Fig . 3 a ) . Expression and solubility problems precluded the analysis of the full - length protein . As shown in Fig . 3 b , the talin - like domain of mHip1R binds to F - actin in a specific , saturable , and concentration - dependent manner with a relatively high af - finity . mHip1R Shows a Punctate Perinuclear and Cortical Subcellular Localization The antibody raised against mHip1R ( aa 1032 – 1068 ) was used to study its subcellular localization in different cell lines . This antibody labeled punctate structures that were enriched at the cell cortex and excluded from the nucleus ( Fig . 4 , a – f ) . The punctate subcellular distribu - tion was observed in all cell lines examined ( COS - 7 , NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts , MDCK , and PC12 ) . The mHip1R - positive staining is also enriched in the perinuclear re - gion , where it often appears more continuous ( Fig . 4 a and Fig . 5 d ) . The cortical staining was present on all surfaces . Similar results were obtained with polarized MDCK cells , in which case the Hip1R staining was observed both on api - cal and basolateral surfaces ( data not shown ) . At the cell Figure 3 .

The gels were stained with Coomassie blue , where P represents the pellets and S repre - sents the supernatants . 0 – 10 (cid:109) M nonmuscle actin was used with a constant concentration of GST - talin domain ( 1 . 5 (cid:109) M ) . ( b ) Per - centage of GST - talin domain bound to actin as a function of actin concentration . GST alone was used as a control . This experiment was repeated three times with similar results . Engqvist - Goldstein et al . Hip1R Endocytic and Cytoskeletal Protein 1509 periphery , Hip1R was also present in some F - actin – rich membrane ruffles , where the staining appeared continu - ous rather than punctate ( Fig . 4 , g – i ) . In these ruffles , Hip1R partially colocalized with F - actin ( Fig . 4 i ) . Since mHip1R contains an actin - binding domain that is homolo - gous to that of the focal adhesion protein talin , it was im - portant to determine whether mHip1R also localizes to focal adhesions . However , double - labeling with paxillin , another focal adhesion protein , showed that mHip1R does not localize to focal adhesions ( data not shown ) . In sum - mary , mHip1R shows a punctate staining pattern and is enriched at the cell cortex and in the perinuclear region , and is present in some membrane ruffles . mHip1R Colocalizes with Markers for Receptor - mediated Endocytosis The yeast homologue of mHip1R ( Sla2p ) is required for endocytosis and localizes to cortical patches that partially overlap with actin patches . Because of the limited resolu - tion in yeast cells , it has been difficult to determine whether Sla2p colocalizes with components of the en - docytic machinery . To address this question in mammalian cells , we examined whether the punctate structures stained by the anti - mHip1R antibodies are also recognized by dif - ferent markers for receptor - mediated endocytosis . We first tested whether mHip1R colocalizes with the coat pro - tein , clathrin , which is involved in budding of vesicles from Figure 4 .

Confocal images close to the cell attachment surface . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1510 the plasma membrane and from the TGN ( for review see Hirst and Robinson , 1998 ) . mHip1R and clathrin showed an overall similar subcellular distribution and colocaliza - tion . Both are enriched in the perinuclear region ( Fig . 5 , a – c ) . The mHip1R and clathrin perinuclear colocalization is es - pecially evident when examined by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 5 , d – f ) . Additionally , the cortical mHip1R and clath - rin staining colocalized ( Fig . 5 , g – i ) . The only marked dif - ference in the staining patterns of mHip1R and clathrin was in membrane ruffles , structures in which mHip1R , but not clathrin , is present ( Fig . 5 a , arrow ) . We also tested whether mHip1R colocalizes with the adaptor protein AP - 2 , which is involved in budding from the plasma membrane during clathrin - mediated endocytosis . As shown in Fig . 5 , j – l , the staining pattern of mHip1R is almost identical to that of AP - 2 , except that AP - 2 was not detected in the perinuclear region or in membrane ruffles . Next , we tested whether Hip1R colocalizes with trans - ferrin - labeled endosomal compartments in COS - 7 cells . Pulse – chase experiments using Texas red – labeled trans - ferrin showed that Hip1 partially colocalizes with en - docytic compartments ( Fig . 6 ) .

Hip1R Endocytic and Cytoskeletal Protein 1511 ferrin shows a rather continuous labeling of the cell cortex , and it is difficult to discern any individual puncta ( Fig . 6 b ) . Hip1R - positive puncta at the cell cortex overlap with this cortical transferrin staining ( Fig . 6 , a – c ) . After 5 – 15 min uptake , transferrin showed a punctate staining that partially colocalizes with Hip1R ( Fig . 6 , d – f ) . At later stages of uptake ( 15 – 60 min ) , transferrin labels larger endosomal compartments , possibly recycling endosomes and / or late endosomes . These endosomal compartments show much less Hip1R staining ( data not shown ) . In sum - mary , mHip1R colocalizes with clathrin , AP - 2 , and with transferrin - labeled early endocytic compartments . mHip1R Is a Peripheral Membrane Protein that Is Enriched in Clathrin - coated Vesicle Fractions Since mHip1R colocalized with markers for receptor - medi - ated endocytosis , it was important to determine whether mHip1R is tightly associated with clathrin - coated vesicles . We first determined by subcellular fractionation whether mHip1R is a soluble or peripheral membrane protein . As shown in Fig . 7 a , the majority of mHip1R associates with the particulate fractions ( P1 , P2 , and P3 ) , and a very small pool is soluble ( S3 ) . This distribution is different from that of other cytoskeletal proteins like paxillin and Abp1 , but it is very similar to that of clathrin ( Fig . 7 and data not shown ) . mHip1R can be extracted from the particulate fraction with 0 . 5 M NaCl , indicating that mHip1R is a pe - ripheral membrane protein and not an integral membrane protein ( Fig . 7 a , lanes 9 and 10 ) . In addition , extraction of P2 with the nonionic detergent Triton X - 100 showed that a pool of mHip1R is Triton X - 100 – insoluble ( Fig . 7 a , lanes 7 and 8 ) , a characteristic shared by many cytoskeletal membrane proteins . These fractionation properties are similar to those of yeast Sla2p and human Hip1 ( Kalch - man et al . , 1997 ; Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . Figure 6 .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1512 Because the association of mHip1R with P2 and P3 could reflect association with endosomes and vesicles , we next examined whether mHip1R copurifies with clathrin - coated vesicles . Clathrin - coated vesicles were purified from mouse brain , and as shown in Fig . 7 c , mHip1R was highly enriched in this preparation , similar to clathrin . Coomassie staining ( Fig . 7 b ) shows that clathrin was a major component of this vesicle fraction , and that we achieved a clathrin - coated vesicle purity similar to that de - scribed previously in the literature ( Lindner , 1998 ) . This fraction contained no detectable levels of BiP1 , which is a protein resident in the ER ( Fig . 7 c ) , or any detectable lev - els of syntaxin 1 , which is a protein resident in the plasma membrane ( data not shown ) . Other known components of clathrin - coated vesicles , Eps15 and Amphiphysin 2 , were present in this preparation , although they did not appear enriched to the same extent as mHip1R ( Fig . 7 c ) . Other cytoskeletal proteins like mAbp1 and paxillin were not de - tected in the clathrin - coated vesicle preparation ( Fig . 7 c and data not shown ) . mHip1R Contains Cytoskeletal and Endocytic Localization Signals The in vitro actin binding assay and the subcellular frac - tionation results suggested that mHip1R associates with both the actin cytoskeleton and components of clathrin - coated vesicles . To identify which domain ( s ) are responsible for these interactions in vivo , we determined the subcellular localization of different mHip1R fragments expressed in COS - 7 cells ( Fig . 8 a ) . The fragments were tagged with myc and / or with GFP . Each of these constructs expressed a stable protein that migrated on SDS gels at the predicted molecular weight ( Fig . 8 b ) . Both mHip1R ( aa 1 – 1068 ) – GFP and mHip1R ( aa 1 – 1068 ) – 6 myc showed a punctate subcellular localization similar to the endogenous protein ( Fig . 8 , c and d ) . In addi - tion , analysis of mHip1R ( aa 1 – 1068 ) – GFP revealed a lo - calization similar to the endogenous protein at membrane ruffles ( data not shown ) . This analysis was confined to cells expressing lower levels of the tagged proteins , be - cause in cells expressing higher levels , the specific staining is obscured by the increased cytosolic staining . The ob - served staining patterns and the fact that these full - length constructs colocalized with endogenous clathrin and AP - 2 ( data not shown ) suggested that the tags did not interfere with mHip1R localization . In contrast to the full - length protein , mHip1R ( aa 766 – 1068 ) – GFP , which expresses the talin - like domain alone , did not show a punctate staining pattern but instead showed continuous staining enriched at the cell cortex . That mHip1R ( aa 766 – 1068 ) – GFP colocalized with F - actin is especially evident in membrane ruffles in COS - 7 cells ( Fig . 8 e ) . This result is consistent with the in vitro actin binding assay , showing that this talin - like domain copellets with F - actin . This construct also showed some nuclear staining even at low expression levels . mHip1R ( aa 346 – Figure 7 . mHip1R is a peripheral membrane protein that cofrac - tionates with clathrin - coated vesicles .

These constructs showed a similar distribution to the GFP constructs , but the corti - cal staining was less pronounced ( data not shown ) . The NH 2 - terminal domain ( mHip1R [ aa 1 – 324 ] – 6 myc ) , which in yeast has been shown to be important for endocytosis ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) , showed cytosolic staining when ex - pressed with a myc - tag ( Fig . 8 g ) . When expressed as a GFP fusion ( mHip1R [ aa 1 – 324 ] – GFP ) , this construct also localized to the nucleus ( data not shown ) .

This construct also colocalized with clathrin and AP - 2 ( data not shown ) . These results show that the talin - like domain is not required for localization with the endocytic machinery . Visualization of mHip1R - GFP in Detergent - extracted and Live Cells Next , we investigated the dynamics of mHip1R in live cells . It has been shown previously that clathrin - coated pits labeled with GFP – clathrin are retained in unfixed , de - tergent - extracted cells ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . To test whether mHip1R - labeled puncta behave like coated pits , we observed mHip1R – GFP in COS - 7 cells before and af - ter treatment with Triton X - 100 . As shown in Fig . 9 , a and b , the majority of mHip1R - GFP – labeled puncta at the cell cortex were retained in extracted cells . In contrast , the perinuclear staining and the cytosolic staining were lost upon Triton X - 100 treatment . These results are similar to those obtained from studies on GFP – clathrin ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . To test whether mHip1R - labeled puncta ex - hibit dynamic behavior similar to that described previ - ously for GFP – clathrin ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) , we ob - served individual puncta at the cell cortex at 1 . 5 - s intervals over 45 frames . During this 67 . 5 - s interval , (cid:122) 60 % of the puncta remained in the same relative location . In contrast , some new puncta appeared , whereas (cid:122) 40 % of the puncta present in the first frame disappeared or were greatly di - minished in subsequent images ( Fig . 9 c ) . As with the ob - servations for clathrin - GFP , some puncta disappeared abruptly , whereas others showed a more gradual change in intensity ( compare disappearing puncta in Fig . 9 ) . Given the fact that mHip1R was also present in lamelli - podia , we next investigated the dynamics of mHip1R puncta in lamellipodia of motile NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts . Lamellipodia are regions of high membrane and actin dy - namics . These regions are relatively flat , thus facilitating the visualization of individual puncta over extended areas of the cell . In these lamellipodia , mHip1R – GFP puncta were observed in addition to some staining at the leading edge ( Fig . 10 ) . The majority of these mHip1R – GFP puncta were motile and moved from the leading edge to - wards the center of the cells ( Fig . 10 a ) . Random move - ments were rarely observed . These directed movements were not observed in COS - 7 cells . However , COS - 7 cells do not form any extended lamellipodial protrusions . The motile puncta showed a net rate of movement of (cid:122) 0 . 5 – 3 . 0 (cid:109) m / min inward from the cell periphery . The fastest move - ments were observed within a zone extending (cid:122) 5 (cid:109) m in from the cell edge . As shown in Fig . 10 a , puncta further away from the cell edge often appeared to be aligned on linear tracks . These puncta moved slowly inwards at a uni - form rate ( (cid:44) 1 (cid:109) m / min ) . To test whether the movement of the puncta in lamellipodia was dependent on F - actin , we observed individual cells before and after treatment with LAT - A , a monomer - sequestering drug that causes depoly - merization of actin filaments ( Coué et al . , 1987 ; Spector et al . , 1989 ) . Before treatment with LAT - A , individual puncta moved inwards from the cell periphery ( Fig . 10 b ) . 5 – 10 min after adding LAT - A , these puncta no longer showed net movement away from the cell periphery . They were ei - ther stationary or were moving in a random fashion ( Fig . 10 c ) . Discussion The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in endocytosis , yet few direct links between the actin cytoskeleton and the endocytic machinery have been established . Here , we show that mHip1R , a mouse homologue of yeast Sla2p , as - Figure 9 . Time - lapse video microscopy of mHip1R – GFP in COS - 7 cells .

Bar , 2 . 5 (cid:109) m . Engqvist - Goldstein et al . Hip1R Endocytic and Cytoskeletal Protein 1515 sociates with both actin filaments and clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . Sequence alignments and secondary structure predic - tions clearly show that mHip1R belongs to the Sla2 family of proteins . Furthermore , we suggest that this protein is an ortholog of human Hip1R , because these two proteins show high sequence identity and similar ubiquitous tissue distribution . In contrast , Hip1 is predominantly expressed in the brain ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ) . Our biochemical and colocalization studies demon - strated that mHip1R associates with clathrin - coated vesi - cles . Since mHip1R colocalized with AP - 2 at the cell cor - tex and shows spatial overlap with transferrin - labeled endocytic compartments at early stages of uptake , we con - clude that mHip1R is a component of both clathrin - coated vesicles and clathrin - coated pits . In support of the associa - tion of mHip1R with clathrin - coated pits , we showed in COS - 7 cells that puncta at the cell cortex labeled with mHip1R – GFP exhibit similar behavior to that reported previously for puncta labeled with clathrin – GFP in this cell type ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . That is , in both cases the puncta remained relatively stationary , but their signal intensities changed dramatically , with puncta disappear - ing and appearing over time . Furthermore , the cortical mHip1R staining is resistant to extraction with Triton X - 100 , a property shared with clathrin – GFP ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . It is interesting that mHip1R is not only enriched at the Figure 10 . Time - lapse video microscopy of mHip1R – GFP in NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts . ( a – c ) The first image in each series shows a low magnification overview of the cell . Bars in the figures serve as stationary reference points .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1516 cell cortex but also in the perinuclear region , another re - gion of clathrin localization . Clathrin is involved not only in endocytosis but also in budding of exocytic vesicles from the TGN ( Robinson , 1987 ; Ahle et al . , 1988 ) . The perinuclear staining of mHip1R is sensitive to treatment with brefeldin A and nocodazole ( data not shown ) , sug - gesting that this immunostaining represents the TGN . Thus , mHip1R may function both in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and in clathrin - mediated budding from the TGN . Currently , the molecular function of mHip1R in these processes is not known . However , it is important to note that both pathways involve formation of invagina - tions of membrane , coat assembly , and vesicle fission , pro - cesses for which a related machinery is used ( for review see Hirst and Robinson , 1998 ) . Not only does the coat con - tain clathrin in both cases , but the adaptor complexes em - ployed are related ( AP - 2 at the plasma membrane and AP - 1 at the TGN ) . It is attractive to speculate that mHip1R may be capable of interacting in a similar manner with the related vesicle budding machinery that mediates endocytosis and TGN vesicle budding . It is worth noting that huntingtin protein has also been identified as a com - ponent of clathrin - coated vesicles ( Velier et al . , 1998 ) , sug - gesting Hip1 and / or Hip1R and huntingtin might function together in clathrin - mediated processes . mHip1R is a modular protein with several conserved domains that could potentially interact with other pro - teins . The talin - like domain is the most conserved se - quence among Sla2p family members . Here , we showed that this domain of mHip1R binds to F - actin in vitro and colocalizes with F - actin in vivo . This demonstrates that F - actin binding is a conserved activity between mHip1R and yeast Sla2p ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) . Deletion of the talin - like domain in Sla2p has only a subtle effect on actin cytoskeleton organization and does not appear to af - fect endocytosis , whereas overexpression of this domain causes dramatic defects in actin organization , with an in - crease in F - actin structures ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Yang et al . ( 1999 ) concluded that this domain may provide functions redundant with that of the Sla2 NH 2 ter - minus . More work is required to fully elucidate the func - tion of the mHip1R talin - like domain . We show that within the NH 2 - terminal part of the pro - tein , mHip1R contains a second localization signal that is important for association with the endocytic machinery . The NH 2 - terminal domain alone showed a nonvesicular cytosolic and nuclear staining , whereas the NH 2 - terminal domain plus the coiled – coil domain localized in a manner similar to the full - length protein . This observation suggests that the central coiled – coil domain contains the signal , or that both domains are needed simultaneously . We favor the latter possibility , because expression of the coiled – coil domain together with the talin - like domain does not show a punctate staining but instead shows colocalization with F - actin . One possibility is that the NH 2 - terminal domain plus the central coiled – coil domain dimerizes with the en - dogenous protein . In yeast Sla2p , the NH 2 - terminal do - main has been shown to be essential for receptor - medi - ated endocytosis , whereas other domains are dispensable ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . The NH 2 - terminal deletion mutant also had defects in cell morphology and organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) showed that a mutant lacking the cen - tral coiled – coil domain in Sla2p in combination with dele - tion of either Abp1p or Srv2p , also caused a defect in re - ceptor - mediated endocytosis . ABP1 and SRV2 are genes encoding two actin - binding proteins whose null alleles are synthetic lethal with sla2 (cid:68) , indicating that these proteins may perform redundant functions ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . Therefore , we concluded that the NH 2 - terminal domain and the central coiled – coil domain are involved in endocytosis , and that the latter domain may be functionally redundant with either Abp1p or Srv2p . This conclusion is consistent with our observation that both the NH 2 - terminal domain and the central coiled – coil domain are required for localization to clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . As discussed above , full - length mHip1R did not show a subcellular localization that is typical of F - actin binding proteins . Instead , it appears to be tightly associated with clathrin - coated vesicles and pits . However , endocytosis oc - curs at the actin - rich cell cortex . There , membrane - associ - ated mHip1R could bind to the actin cytoskeleton directly . A further indication of the relevance of mHip1R actin as - sociation is the fact that the endogenous protein is present in some membrane ruffles , where it partially colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton . It has been shown previously that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton inhibits re - ceptor - mediated endocytosis in some cell types ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) , and it has been specu - lated that the actin cytoskeleton may provide a force re - quired for budding and / or provide a scaffold for the en - docytic machinery . The function of mHip1R could be to link the actin cytoskeleton to coated pits to facilitate vesi - cle budding . The actin cytoskeleton might also be involved in the transport of vesicles away from the plasma membrane . There is evidence that pinocytic vesicles associate with ac - tin tails , and it has been proposed that endocytic vesicles and pinosomes move into the cytosol by means of a brief burst of actin polymerization , analogous to the movement of Listeria and Shigella ( Merrifield et al . , 1999 ) . Recently , two proteins that are known to affect actin dynamics have also been shown to associate with components of the en - docytic machinery . First , N - WASP , a protein that can stimulate the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) , has been shown to interact with syn - dapin I ( Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) . Syndapin I is an src ho - mology domain 3 ( SH3 ) - containing brain protein that binds to the GTPase dynamin I ( Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) , the protein that controls the vesicle fission event in recep - tor - mediated endocytosis ( for review see Schmid et al . , 1998 ) . Second , profilin , a G - actin binding protein that is important for regulation of actin assembly , has been shown to bind to dynamin 1 in vitro and to colocalize with dynamin I in hippocampal neurons ( Witke et al . , 1998 ) . Profilin is also capable of binding to inositol phosphates ( Witke et al . , 1998 ) , leading to the speculation that cluster - ing of phospholipids into local domains of the plasma membrane might be a common mechanism to regulate cortical actin assembly as well as membrane flow . In our study , we presented evidence that mHip1R - containing coated pits and / or vesicles move by an actin - dependent mechanism in NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts . Punctate structures la - Engqvist - Goldstein et al . Hip1R Endocytic and Cytoskeletal Protein 1517 beled with mHip1R – GFP moved inward from the cell pe - riphery in lamellipodia , and this directed movement was inhibited by LAT - A . Our data suggest that mHip1R is an - other component linking the actin cytoskeleton to sites of endocytosis . Therefore , mHip1R is a candidate to facili - tate this movement . In yeast , genetic and biochemical data have suggested that Sla2p , along with Abp1p , Srv2p , and Rvs167p , partici - pate in the early stage of endocytosis ( for review see Wendland et al . , 1998 ) . Abp1p binds both to Rvs167p and to Srv2p ( Freeman et al . , 1996 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . In addition , sla2 (cid:68) is synthetic lethal with mutants of the genes encoding each of these proteins ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . Rvs167p is related to the mammalian protein amphiphysin , which is a protein known to be involved in receptor - mediated endocytosis ( for re - view see Wigge and McMahon , 1998 ) . Srv2 , on the other hand , is a protein implicated in cAMP and Ras signaling ( Fedor - Chaiken et al . , 1990 ; Field et al . , 1990 ) . Sla2p also has been recently implicated by yeast two - hybrid interac - tions in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton by binding to the Ser / Thr kinase Ark1p ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) . Ark1p shows genetic interactions with Prk1p , a homologous ki - nase , which in turn shows genetic interactions with both Sla2p and Abp1p ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , in yeast a net - work of physical and genetic interactions involving ki - nases , cortical actin patch proteins , and components of the endocytic machinery is emerging ( Wendland et al . , 1998 ; Cope et al . , 1999 ) . For most of these yeast proteins , related proteins in mammals are known . For example , we have re - cently identified and characterized mAbp1 , a mouse pro - tein related to yeast Apb1p ( Kessels et al . , 2000 ) . Further studies drawing on the complementary experimental ad - vantages of yeast and mammalian cells will provide in - sights into the molecular role of mHip1R , and will reveal the function of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis . These studies may also provide insights into the etiology of Huntington disease .
