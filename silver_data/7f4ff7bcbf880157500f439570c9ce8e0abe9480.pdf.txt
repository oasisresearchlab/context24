In vertebrates , only a few methylhistidine - containing proteins have been reported , including b - actin as an essential example . The evolutionary conserved methylation of b - actin H73 is catalyzed by an as yet unknown histidine N - methyltransferase . We report here that the protein SETD3 is the actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase . In vitro , recombinant rat and human SETD3 methylated b - actin at H73 . Knocking - out SETD3 in both human HAP1 cells and in Drosophila melanogaster resulted in the absence of methylation at b - actin H73 in vivo , whereas b - actin from wildtype cells or flies was > 90 % methylated . As a consequence , we show that Setd3 - deficient HAP1 cells have less cellular F - actin and an increased glycolytic phenotype . In conclusion , by identifying SETD3 as the actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase , our work pioneers new research into the possible role of this modification in health and disease and questions the substrate specificity of SET - domain - containing enzymes .

Consequently , much is known about the methylation of lysine and arginine residues in histones and about the fundamental role of such modifications in the epigenetic control of mamma - lian gene expression ( Greer and Shi , 2012 ) . In addition , there are a growing number of examples showing that the methylation of non - histone proteins is a prevalent PTM that regulates diverse bio - logical processes , including protein synthesis and signal transduction ( for a review , see Biggar and Li , 2015 ) . More interestingly , non - histone proteins may be methylated on atypical residues such as glutamate , glutamine , cysteine and histidine ( Clarke , 2013 ) . The methylation of histidine residues in proteins has been known for many years but , curiously , only for a few proteins in Nature , including b - actin ( Johnson et al . , 1967 ) , S100A9 protein ( Raftery et al . , 1996 ) , myosin ( Elzinga and Collins , 1977 ) , myosin kinase ( Meyer and Mayr , 1987 ) and ribosomal protein RPL3 ( Webb et al . , 2010 ) . However , a recent study from Ning et al . ( 2016 ) suggests that protein methylation on histidine resi - dues may actually be a quite common phenomenon , modifying dozens if not hundreds of intracellu - lar proteins in mammalian cells . Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 1 of 42 RESEARCH ARTICLE The current knowledge on histidine N - methyltransferases , which are the enzymes that catalyze the methylation of histidines in proteins is still sparse . The yeast protein Yil110w ( Hpm1p ) , which methylates histidine 243 in the ribosomal protein Rpl3p , is the first and only histidine protein methyl - transferase molecularly identified to date ( Webb et al . , 2010 ) . Hpm1p is the seven b - strand methyl - transferase ( 7BS MTase ) , which has been classified in the methyltransferase family 16 ( MTF16 ) ( for review , see Falnes et al . , 2016 ) . The MTF16 group comprises mostly protein - lysine methyltransfer - ases , such as Mettl20 – 23 and Camkmt , with the noticeable exceptions of Hpm1p and of Efm7 , which methylates the N - terminal glycine in the eukaryotic translation elongation factor one alpha ( eEF1A ) . The MTF16 group appears to be distinct from both the other known 7BS protein - lysine MTases ( e . g . Dot1L , Mettl10 and N6amt2 ) and the non - protein methylating 7BS MTases ( e . g . Mettl1 , Comt and Gnmt ) . On the other hand , the enzyme responsible for actin - specific histidine methylation has been partially purified , but the gene encoding this enzyme remains to be identified ( Vijayasarathy and Narasinga Rao , 1987 ; Raghavan et al . , 1992 ) . Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and a major component of the cyto - skeleton ( for a review , see Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ) . It is a highly conserved protein during evolu - tion ( » 90 % identity between yeast and human protein ) , and in vertebrates there are three main isoforms that only differ by a few amino acids at their N - terminus . a - Actins are expressed in skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscle , whereas b - and g - isoforms are present in non - muscle and muscle cells . Under physiological conditions , actin exists as a 42 - kDa monomeric globular protein ( G - actin ) that binds ATP and spontaneously polymerizes into stable filaments ( F - actin ) . Once these filaments have been assembled , the terminal phosphate of the bound ATP is hydrolyzed and slowly released from actin , leading to the sequential depolymerization of the filament . The maintenance of a pool of actin monomers , the initialization of the polymerization process , and the regulation of the assembly and turnover of actin filaments are extremely complex and well controlled . These involve more than 100 interacting partner proteins , so that actin contributes to more protein – protein interactions than any other protein ( Lappalainen , 2016 ) . Actin plays a role in many central cell functions , including cell growth , division , and motility ( Dominguez and Holmes , 2011 ) , which makes it essential for cell sur - vival . Consequently , various efforts have been made to elucidate the role of the conserved methyla - tion of the H73 residue ( Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . As a result , it was shown in vitro that H73 methylation stabilizes actin filaments , and that the rate of filaments depolymerization was increased when actin was non - methylated ( Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , the physiological effects of actin hypome - thylation have yet to be reported in cells , tissues or organisms . Here , we report the identification of actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase ( EC 2 . 1 . 1 . 85 ) as SET domain - containing protein 3 ( SETD3 , C14orf154 ) , which was previously shown to act as a histone lysine methyltransferase ( Eom et al . , 2011 ) . We reveal that SETD3 is responsible for the methylation of H73 in human and drosophila actin , and that a loss of SETD3 activity impacts the phenotype of the human HAP1 cell line by lowering F - actin content and increasing glycolytic activity . Results Purification and identification of rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase Actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of the [ 3 H ] methyl group of [ 3 H ] S - adenosyl methionine ( [ 3 H ] SAM ) into either homogeneous recombi - nant human b - actin produced in Escherichia coli or a H73A b - actin mutant ( Figure 1—figure supple - ment 1 ) , which served as a negative control , ensuring that only the H73 - specific N - methyltransferase activity was measured ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . The use of recombinant human b - actin as the rat methyltransferase substrate was reasonable because the sequences of human and rat b - actin cannot be distinguished from one another , owing to an extreme evolutionary conservation . Follow - ing numerous purification steps , the N - methyltransferase activity was purified from rat leg muscle approximately 1200 - fold ( see Table 1 ) . The methyltransferase was eluted as a single peak in each of the purification steps ( Figure 1 ) , indicating the presence of a single enzyme species . No methylation of H73A b - actin was detected at any stage of the purification , suggesting that the myofibrillar extract of rat muscle is devoid of other b - actin - methylating enzymes . The overall yield of the Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 2 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology purification was only about 0 . 6 % ( see Table 1 ) , largely because of the fact that in the last two steps of purification , only the most active fractions were used for the next step of the procedure . SDS - PAGE analysis of the activity peak fractions ( F2 and F3 ) from the Reactive Red 120 - agarose showed a protein concentration that was too low to allow the identification of the proteins coeluting with the enzymatic activity ( Figure 1D ) . Thus , the proteins in these fractions were concentrated about 15 - fold and reanalyzed by SDS - PAGE . Actin - methylating activity coeluted with three protein bands of about 65 , 75 and 90 kDa , which were clearly visible in the concentrated fraction F3 ( Figure 1D ) . These bands were cut out from the gel , digested with trypsin and analyzed by MS / MS . The sequences of the identified peptides were compared with the rat reference proteome from the NCBI Protein database . This comparison indicated that there was only one methyltransferase among these peptides , present in band ‘C’ , and this was identified as histone lysine N - methyltrans - ferase SETD3 ( Table 2 ) . Eighteen peptide sequences from the rat SETD3 ( underlined in Figure 2 ) that had shared identity with other SETD3 proteins in the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) Protein database were found to cover about 39 % of its sequence . However , to exclude the possibility of missing any potential methyltransferase as the result of a poor extraction of tryptic peptides from protein bands , we performed the MS / MS identification of all proteins pres - ent in the entire fraction 14 of Superdex 200 ( see Figure 1B ) and fraction F3 of Reactive red 120 ( see Figure 1C ) , and SETD3 protein was again the only methyltransferase found in these fractions . As SETD3 protein was shown to methylate histones ( Eom et al . , 2011 ) and all of the SET - domain - containing enzymes characterized to date are protein lysine methyltransferases ( Clarke , 2013 ) , we were surprised to find that SETD3 was the protein histidine N - methyltransferase responsible for the measured activity . To double check our results , we performed another complete , though modified , round of purification of the actin - methylating enzyme from rat leg muscles , as well as MS / MS analy - sis of the most purified fractions from Superdex 200 . Once again , we identified SETD3 protein as the only meaningful candidate for rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase , suggesting we had identified the correct protein . Moreover , our results were in agreement with previous reports sug - gesting that the actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase corresponded to a » 70 kDa protein ( Raghavan et al . , 1992 ) . Analysis of SETD3 protein sequences Protein BLAST searches ( Altschul et al . , 1997 ) with rat SETD3 and phylogenetic analysis of the resulting sequences indicated that orthologs of this protein were found in almost all eukaryotes including vertebrates ( » 75 – 98 % identity with the rat sequence ) , insects ( » 35 – 40 % identity ) , plants and fungi ( » 30 % identity ) ( Figure 3 ) . No SETD3 orthologs were detected in the sequenced prote - ome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or of Naegleria gruberi in agreement with previous reports , show - ing the absence of actin - specific histidine methyltransferase activity in these species ( Kalhor et al . , 1999 ) . All taxa followed the expected lines of descent , indicating that the enzyme was present in a common eukaryotic ancestor ( see Figure 3 ) . A low similarity in amino - acid sequence between Table 1 .

A partial protein structure of human SETD3 has been published ( PDB 3SMT ) . It lacks about 100 amino acids at the C - terminus , but it shows both substrate - binding domains . As shown in Figure 4A , these two domains form a wide cleft in the center of SETD3 , so that the enzyme adopts a cradle - like shape . The SAM molecule is bound in the bottom of the cleft , exposing its labile methyl group ( see Figure 4A ) . It seems likely that the cradle - shape of the enzyme allows it to arch over a protein substrate , and that the position of SAM facilitates the subsequent transfer of the methyl group onto a specific amino acid ( in the case of actin , a histidine ) , most probably located at the sur - face of a substrate protein . Figure 4 . Structures of human b - actin and SETD3 enzyme . Ribbon representations of the structures of both ( A ) the SETD3 protein and ( B ) the actin monomer are shown in different projections . ( A ) The ‘SET’ and ‘Rubisco LSMT’ substrate - binding domains of SETD3 are highlighted in blue and red , respectively . The spatial organization of these domains gives the enzyme a cradle - like shape . The S - adenosyl - L - methionine ( SAM ) molecule is bound at the bottom of this cradle , exposing its labile methyl group ( green ) to a protein substrate . ( B ) The four subdomains of actin are marked with numbers . Subdomains 1 and 2 form the small ( outer ) domain , whereas subdomains 3 and 4 constitute the large ( inner ) domain . Two large clefts are present between these domains : the nucleotide binding cleft and the hydrophobic one , while ATP is bound at the center of the molecule . The nucleotide sensor loop , which contains the methyl - accepting H73 residue , spans from Pro70 to Asn78 and is shown in black . Several residue – residue distances are shown to give information concerning the molecular dimension of these proteins . All models were prepared using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) from the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) structures of b - actin ( 2BTF ) and SETD3 ( 3SMT ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 8 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology As shown in Figure 4B , b - actin has a globular shape , flattened in one dimension . It consists of large and small domains that are further subdivided into subdomains 1 , 2 and 3 , 4 , respectively . The nucleotide - binding cleft ( for ATP or ADP binding ) is located inside the cleft between subdomains 2 and 4 , while a hydrophobic cleft is present between subdomains 1 and 3 at the ‘bottom’ of the actin molecule , and serves as a primary binding site for numerous actin - binding proteins . The methyl - accepting H73 residue is present in a nucleotide sensor loop ( P70 to N78 ) in an insert between sub - domains 1 and 2 . The H73 is present at the surface of the actin monomers and seems to be easily accessed by the methyltransferase . Furthermore , the estimated dimensions of the actin monomer and of the substrate - binding cleft in SETD3 indicate that actin could be accommodated well at the cleft of the methyltransferase and that steric hindrance should not prevent interactions between these proteins . Characterization of recombinant SETD3 proteins To confirm the molecular identity of rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase with that of rat SETD3 and to compare the activities of rat and human methyltransferases , these two SETD3 ortho - logs were expressed in COS - 7 cells as fusion proteins with the C - terminal polyhistidine tag ( Figure 5 ) . The recombinant enzymes catalyzed the methylation of recombinant b - actin , but not of the H73A mutant ( see Figure 5 ) . In further studies , large amounts of recombinant enzymes were produced in COS - 7 cells , purified to homogeneity ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) and shown to catalyze the methylation of actin ( Figure 6 ) . In addition , the recombinant human and rat SETD3 with the N - terminal His 6 - tag were produced in E . coli , purified ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) and also shown to methylate actin ( Figure 7 ) . Their specific activity was similar to that determined for the enzymes produced in the COS - 7 cells ( » 5 nmol . min (cid:0) 1 . mg (cid:0) 1 protein ) , which further confirms the identification of SETD3 as the actin - specific methyltransferase . As partially purified rabbit actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase ( Raghavan et al . , 1992 ) was shown to methylate a synthetic peptide ( Peptide H : YPIE H GIVT ) , corresponding to the H73 - con - taining nucleotide sensor loop of the actin molecule , we wanted to know whether SETD3 can meth - ylate peptide H . As shown in Figure 8 , the two SETD3 orthologs catalyzed the methylation of peptide H , but they did not methylate peptide A ( YPIE A GIVT ) , a variant of the nucleotide sensor loop in which H73 is replaced by an alanine . Even if the rat and human SETD3 activities measured with peptide H were very poor ( » 0 . 02 nmol . min (cid:0) 1 . mg (cid:0) 1 protein ) compared with the actual methyla - tion of actin ( » 5 nmol . min (cid:0) 1 . mg (cid:0) 1 protein ) , these activities further indicated that SETD3 is the histi - dine - specific N - methyltransferase . To confirm the specific methylation of H73 in recombinant human b - actin , we incubated it with homogenous recombinant rat and human SETD3 enzymes in the presence of deuterated SAM ( [ 2 H ] SAM ) . This resulted in approximately 35 % of the actin being methylated , as measured using a radio - chemical assay that was run in parallel . At the end of the reaction , the proteins in the assay mixture were separated by SDS - PAGE , and the bands corresponding to the b - actin polypeptide were ana - lyzed by nanoUPLC - Q - TOF . At least 74 % of the actin sequence coverage was achieved in each MS analysis , including all of the known methyl - accepting sites in human b - actin ( K18 , K68 , H73 , K84 , K191 and K326 , see http : / / www . phosphosite . org ) . Peptide YPIEHGIVTNWDDMEK ( M + H = 1963 . 9355 Da ) containing the H73 residue was the only tri - deuterium - methylated peptide detected by the PLGS 2 . 4 software ( Waters , USA ) . Manual inspection of the MS / MS spectra of both the parent ion of this peptide and its fragments confirmed the presence of tri - deuterium - methylated H73 ( Figure 9 ) . Both rat and human SETD3 enzymes catalyzed tri - deuterium - methylation of H73 in b - actin , whereas no such modification was detected in YPIEHGIVTNWDDMEK peptide ( M + H = 1946 . 9021 Da ) or in any other tryptic peptide derived from b - actin protein incubated in the absence of SETD3 ( see Figure 9 ) . SETD3 was originally reported as a methyltransferase that methylates histone H3 in zebrafish and mouse ( Kim et al . , 2011 ; Eom et al . , 2011 ) . Specifically , the enzyme was shown to methylate a his - tone H3 . 3 peptide ( H3N4 : STGGV K ) , suggesting that it could methylate K36 of mouse histone H3 . We therefore compared the SETD3 - dependent methylation of actin peptide H ( see Figure 8 ) and the histone peptide H3N4 . We could see that SETD3 methylated both peptides ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) , but peptide H was at least 10 - fold more efficiently methylated than peptide H3N4 , confirming that SETD3 is most probably a histidine N - methyltransferase rather than a lysine - specific methyltransferase .

Both enzymes had comparable estimates of V max value at saturating concentrations of SAM , but the K M for b - actin ( » 0 . 8 m M ) was about 4 - fold lower for human SETD3 than for the rat enzyme ( 3 m M ) . Consequently , the catalytic efficiency ( K M / k cat ) of human SETD3 towards b - actin was 3 - fold higher than that of the rat enzyme ( see Table 3 ) . Taking into account the intracellular concentrations of SAM and b - actin monomers , however , the two enzymes probably operate at similar V 0 in vivo , i . e . close to their V max ( » 10 nmol . min (cid:0) 1 . mg (cid:0) 1 pro - tein ) . By contrast , actin peptide H was a very poor substrate for SETD3 as rat and human SETD3 cat - alyzed methylation of the peptide with extremely low V max values and showed several thousand – fold lower affinity towards the peptide in comparison to the values determined with human b - actin ( see Table 3 ) . It is well - established that actin that is produced in bacteria forms non - native mis - folded species that aggregate into inclusion bodies ( Stemp et al . , 2005 ) . This is because actin requires the assis - tance of the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT ( TRiC ) to enable it to fold into its native conformation Figure 7 .

More importantly , yeast - produced human b - actin became a good substrate for SETD3 when purified in denaturing conditions and re - folded into nucleotide - free quasi - native actin , as did E . coli - produced recombinant human b - actin ( see Figure 10 ) . This effect was not due to the absence of free nucleotides in the reaction mixture because the addition of either 0 . 5 mM ATP or ADP ( a 10 - fold excess over the concentrations of nucleotides in the preparation of yeast - pro - duced actin ) did not impact the activity of SETD3 towards the refolded actin . To try to solve this puz - zle , we prepared nucleotide - free yeast - produced human b - actin monomers in complex with either profilin or cofilin ( two well known interacting partner proteins of b - actin [ Lappalainen , 2016 ] ) and tested whether the actin complexes became good substrates for SETD3 .

Taken together , our results indicate that globular actin mono - mers ( probably in complex with some actin - binding proteins ) or possibly also F - actin can be methyl - ated by SETD3 in vivo . SETD3 is the b - actin H73 methyltransferase in HAP1 human cells and Drosophila melanogaster To assess the importance of SETD3 in methylating the b - actin H73 residue in vivo , we used CRISPR / Cas9 technology to inactivate the Setd3 gene in HAP1 cells . Five distinct Setd3 - KO clonal HAP1 cell - lines were generated , as described in the ’Materials and methods’ , and three of these were ulti - mately selected for further studies ( KO - A1 , KO - A3 and KO - A5 ) . Sequencing of the DNA showed the presence of mutations , preventing the production of active SETD3 in these cell lines ( see ’Materials and methods’ for details of the mutations introduced ) , which was further confirmed by the absence of SETD3 protein in cell extracts from KO - A1 , KO - A3 and KO - A5 ( Figure 11 ) . To analyze the methylation of H73 in actin from wildtype and SETD3 - KO HAP1 cell lines , we par - tially purified the actin from these lines ( Figure 12A ) and analyzed these proteins by tandem mass spectrometry of the band corresponding to actin from the fraction containing the highest concentra - tion of actin ( Figure 12B ) . As shown in Figure 12C , methylation of the H73 residue was detected in almost all H73 - containing b - actin peptides derived from the wildtype HAP1 cells , whereas close to 90 % of the same b - actin peptides derived from two different Setd3 - deficient cell lines were not methylated at H73 . Importantly , the total number of b - actin peptides identified in MS / MS experi - ments was comparable for wildtype ( 300 – 400 Peptide Spectrum Matches ) and KO cells ( » 500 Pep - tide Spectrum Matches ) , indicating that similar amounts of actin protein were analyzed in all experiments . We next took advantage of the recently published knock - out model of SETD3 in D . melanogaster ( Tiebe et al . , 2018 ) to investigate the methylation status of actin in vivo . The absence of SETD3 in the fly prevented the methylation of Drosophila actin on H74 ( which corresponds to the H73 in the mammalian protein ) . Soluble proteins in homogenates from wildtype and Setd 3 - deficient Drosophila larvae were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry . As shown in Table 4 , the knock - out of SETD3 prevented the methylation of all three different forms of actin ( actin - 42A , (cid:0) 57B and (cid:0) 87E ) present in extracts from the fly larvae , whereas all H74 - containing actin peptides derived from wildtype lar - vae were methylated .

Homogeneous recombinant rat SETD3 ( rSETD3 , 0 . 6 m g protein ) or its human orthologue ( hSETD3 , 0 . 45 m g protein ) were incubated at 37 ˚ C for 40 min in the presence of 1 m M ( 100 pmol , » 220 (cid:2) 10 3 cpm ) [ 1 H + 3 H ] SAM and 2 m M ( 200 pmol , 8 . 9 m g ) homogenous recombinant human b - actin produced in S . cerevisiae , and either purified in non - denaturing conditions as complexes with ATP ( ATP - actin ) or ADP ( ADP - actin ) or denatured and refolded to obtain soluble nucleotide - free protein ( refolded nucleotide - free actin ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 16 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Taken together , we show that actin from wildtype HAP1 cells or Drosophila flies was > 90 % meth - ylated , whereas in the absence of SETD3 , neither human cells nor Drosophila can methylate actin H73 or H74 , respectively . This confirms the molecular identification of SETD3 as the evolutionarily conserved actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase , and the extent of actin methylation suggests the high functional importance of this post - translational modification . Absence of SETD3 reduces F - actin and increases glycolytic rate in SETD3 - deficient HAP1 cells Methylation of the actin H73 residue has been shown to stabilize actin filaments , whereas the absence of such modification resulted in an increased rate of depolymerization of these filaments in vitro ( Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . To determine the effect of Setd3 - deficiency on the organization of actin filaments , we used confocal microscopy following F - actin staining with TRITC - phalloidin . To obtain a comprehensive picture of actin filaments , the morphology of F - actin was reconstructed in 3D with the use of Zeiss Zen software ( Zeiss , Germany ) . This technique showed a clear decrease in F - actin content in SETD3 - KO cells , where actin was largely non - methylated at H73 ( Figure 13 ) , suggesting an accelerated actin depolymerization and a loss of cytoskeleton integrity . These effects were more pronounced after 48 hr culture ( compared to 24 hr ) , and are in agreement with the results of previ - ous studies using purified recombinant actin ( Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . To exclude artifacts associated with the clonal populations of HAP1 cells , we analyzed two other SETD3 - KO clones that showed comparable results ( Figure 13—figure supplement 1 ) . Since Nyman et al . ( 2002 ) showed that the replacement of H73 by an alanine decreased the ther - mal stability of actin monomers in vitro , this suggested that the methylation of actin at H73 could contribute to its stability , in agreement with our results in HAP1 cells . Therefore , we wanted to com - pare the in vitro thermostability of actin in cell - free lysates of wildtype ( methylated actin ) and Figure 11 .

The HAP1 cell line was also submitted to the CRISPR / Cas9 gene - inactivation procedure , but the Setd3 gene was not modified ; this was done to exclude off - target effects of the procedure on the HAP1 phenotype . The analysis was performed using 50 m g of the cell lysate protein with a rabbit primary antibody against the human SETD3 ( ab174662 , Abcam ) along with a horseradish - peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody .

When cell extracts were heated at increasing tempera - tures , it became clear that the absence of methylation of H73 destabilized actin in the temperature range between 30 ˚ C to 46 ˚ C ( Figure 14 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that the loss of methylation in H73 leads to a structural instability of actin monomers that might , in turn , result in the accelerated depolymerization of actin filaments in SETD3 - KO cells . A routine daily inspection of HAP1 cell cultures revealed that at about 80 – 90 % culture confluency , Setd3 - deficient HAP1 cells tended to acidify Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium ( IMDM ) faster than the control cells . This phenotype was not attributable to the differences in cell culture density between control and SETD3 - KO cell lines , suggesting an increased formation of lactate from glucose by Setd3 - deficient cells . To test this possibility , both control and Setd3 - deficient HAP1 cells ( 90 % culture confluency ) were further incubated in fresh IMDM medium for 20 hr , after which the medium was collected , and glucose consumption and lactate production were measured in a neutralized HClO 4 extract . As shown in Figure 15 , both the formation of lactate and the consumption of glucose in SETD3 - KO cell lines were increased by about 15 – 20 % in comparison with those determined for the control cells , indicating a shift of their metabolism towards a more glycolytic phenotype . Taken together , these results suggest that the lack of methylation at H73 in HAP1 cells destabilizes F - actin , which possibly explains the increase in glucose consumption that occurs in these cells . Discussion Molecular identity of rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase The presence of two distinct histidine N - methyltransferases in rabbit leg muscle has been reported by Raghavan et al . ( 1992 ) . The first enzyme , carnosine N - methyltransferase catalyzes the N p - methylation of the histidine imidazole ring of carnosine ( b - alanyl - L - histidine ) , an abundant dipeptide in the skeletal muscle of vertebrates . The second enzyme was shown to methylate the N t position of the H73 residue of mammalian b - actin protein . The previous studies performed in our laboratory resulted in the identification of genes coding for carnosine N - methyltransferase in verte - brates ( Drozak et al . , 2013 ; Drozak et al . , 2015 ) , whereas the current investigation presents data that reveal the molecular identification of rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase as the SET domain - containing protein 3 ( SETD3 ) , disclosing the molecular identity of the mammalian actin - Table 4 .

This conclusion is supported by the following findings : ( i ) two different and extensive rounds of purification of the actin - methylating activity from rat skeletal muscle resulted in the identification of the protein SETD3 as the only logical candidate matching the enzymatic activity ; ( ii ) recombinant rat SETD3 catalyzes the specific methylation of the H73 residue present in both the recombinant b - actin protein and the synthetic peptide corresponding to the nucleotide sensor loop of b - actin ; ( iii ) in contrast to actin isolated from control HAP1 cells , the protein present in Setd3 - defi - cient cells is essentially devoid of methylated H73 residues , as verified by MS / MS analysis ; and ( iv ) the inactivation of SETD3 in Drosophila Setd3 knockout larvae results in the complete absence of H74 methylation in all three different actins found in Drosophila . The methylation of H73 is a highly conserved modification among actins from many different eukaryotes , although it has been found to be absent from the actin of the amoeboflagellate N . gru - beri and the yeast S . cerevisiae ( Sussman et al . , 1984 ; Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . Orthologues of the pro - tein SETD3 are present in animals , plants and certain fungi , but not in the proteomes of the abovementioned proteozoan and yeast species , further supporting the identification of SETD3 as the actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase .

Thermal stability of actin in Setd3 - deficient HAP1 cells . Cell free lysates of control HAP1 cells ( WT - A6 ) and Setd3 - deficient clonal HAP1 cells ( KO - A3 ) were incubated for 5 min at 4 , 30 , 40 , 43 , 46 , 49 , 52 , 55 and 60 ˚ C . Precipitated proteins were then pelleted , and the resulting supernatants ( 24 or 48 m g protein ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and by western - blotting , with the use of anti - actin primary antibody ( A2066 , Sigma - Aldrich ) to visualize protein bands corresponding to the actin protein . The levels of actin were quantified by densitometry using Quantity One software ( BioRad ) and normalized to the intensity of the actin band of the sample incubated at 4 ˚ C .

The independent studies of Chen et al . , 2013 confirmed the histone methyltransferase activity of SETD3 and suggested that the enzyme may have other non - histone substrates in the cytoplasm owing to the presence of the Rubisco LSMT substrate - binding domain in its structure . This view was further strengthened by the finding that SETD3 is predominantly localized in the cytosol of human cells , while only a small portion is found in the nucleus ( Cheng et al . , 2017 ) . In the present study , we have not examined the activity of recombinant SETD3 towards histones because isolated histones are extremely poor substrates ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . When we investigated the methyltransferase activity of SETD3 with either the actin peptide H or the histone peptide H3N4 , however , the activity with the histone peptide was at least a 4000 - fold lower than that of recombinant b - actin . Conse - quently , we identified actin as the novel physiological substrate of SETD3 , which is present in the cytoplasm and is likely to be the most abundant actin methyltransferase . It is possible however , that SETD3 may also be a dual methyltransferase able to methylate both the Lys and His residues of other proteins , but this still requires in vivo confirmation . Quasi - native b - actin from bacterial inclusion bodies is a good substrate for the actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase The molecular identification of the actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase through its extensive purification from rat muscles was only possible because we were able to prepare large amounts of pure b - actin monomers to be used as the substrate for measuring the enzymatic activity in radio - chemical assays . Although this b - actin was produced and subsequently purified from the inclusion bodies of E . coli in the nucleotide - free form , it remained a good substrate for the methyltransferase . Given that , on the one hand , it is not possible to produce natively folded actin in bacteria Figure 15 . Impact of SETD3 inactivation on glucose consumption and lactate production in HAP1 cells . Experiments were performed on three HAP1 cell lines that were deficient in Setd3 ( KO - A1 , KO - A3 and KO - A5 ) and a control HAP1 cell line ( WT - A6 ) that has been submitted to the CRISPR / Cas9 gene inactivation procedure , but yielding no modification of the Setd3 gene . HAP1 cells ( » 90 % culture confluency ) were supplemented with fresh medium and incubated for 20 hr as described in the ’Materials and methods’ . The glucose and lactate concentrations in samples of deproteinized culture medium were determined spectrophotometrically as described in the ’Materials and methods’ . Values are the means ± S . E . ( error bars ) of three independent experiments performed with cells from three different culture passages ( n = 3 ) . The data were assumed to be distributed normally , and the homogeneity of variances was verified with F tests .

Indeed , the actin methylation reaction was still substoichiometric , and we have observed the methylation of up to 35 % of the total actin present in the reaction mixture . This observation was readily reproducible in the presence of bacterial SAH nucleosidase and adenine deaminase , suggest - ing that it was not due to a potential accumulation of SAH in the reaction mixture ( unpublished data , Drozak et al . ) . This indicates that only a small portion of the actin monomers produced in bacteria and purified under denaturing conditions adopted a conformation that was recognized by the SETD3 enzyme . This observation is in line with a previous report , showing only a minor methylation of actin inclusion bodies ( up to 1 % protein ) by rabbit actin methyltransferase ( Raghavan et al . , 1992 ) . Furthermore , SETD3 was at least 200 - fold less active towards the synthetic peptide H , corre - sponding to the amino acid sequence surrounding the H73 , than was recombinant b - actin ( see Table 3 ) . This indicated that structural features of the actin molecule other than the primary sequence of the sensor loop are probably important for its recognition by the actin methyltransferase . Both tested SETD3 orthologs are rather ‘lazy’ enzymes , with a k cat of 0 . 6 – 0 . 8 min (cid:0) 1 , resembling the values estimated for protein methyltransferases rather than those measured for enzymes catalyz - ing the methylation of low - molecular - weight substrates ( Clarke and Banfield , 2001 ; Osborne et al . , 2007 ) . Considering that the intracellular concentrations of SAM and b - actin monomers in vertebrate cells are about 30 m M and 50 – 100 m M , respectively ( Clarke and Banfield , 2001 ; Pollard , 2017 ) , both rat and human SETD3 have a high affinity for both SAM ( K M » 0 . 3 m M ) and b - actin ( K M » 0 . 8 – 3 m M ) . These observations suggest that the enzymes may be fully saturated by substrates and operate at rates that are close to their V max in vivo . It is important to keep in mind , however , that the recom - binant b - actin used in the present kinetic studies is certainly not a physiological form of b - actin . Therefore , the affinity of SETD3 to physiological b - actin remains to be verified . It is very intriguing to note that in our hands both the recombinant ATP - and ADP - b - actins pro - duced in yeast ( S . cerevisiae ) , which are expected to have a native conformation , were not methyl - ated by the SETD3 enzyme . By contrast , the yeast - produced actin that was purified in denaturing conditions to yield nucleotide - free quasi native protein became a good substrate for the methyl - transferase . This finding may suggest that the presence of ATP or ADP could create a structural hin - drance that prevents SETD3 from reaching the H73 residue if the methyltransferase interacts with actin through the nucleotide - binding cleft ( see Figure 4 ) . Taken together , these observations have led us to hypothesize that nucleotide - free actin mono - mers in a complex with one or more actin - binding proteins of yet unknown identity could be the physiological substrate for the SETD3 methyltransferase . If so , this resembles the activity of the yeast Yil110w protein , the only other known protein histidine N - methyltransferase , which methylates His243 of the ribosomal Rpl3 protein only when Rpl3 is associated with the ribosome ( Webb et al . , 2010 ; Al - Hadid et al . , 2014 ) . This hypothesis fits with the current knowledge on the enzymes belonging to the family of SET - domain - containing proteins . Indeed , many of these methyltransferases are found in complexes with numerous other proteins that are essential for their catalytic activity and substrate specificity . For example , to exert its catalytic activity , the yeast histone H3 methyltransferase SET1 requires the presence of seven different proteins that form a complex named COMPASS ( Complex of Proteins Associated with Set1 ) , and similar COMPASS - like complexes are formed by other mammalian SET - domain - containing methyltransferases ( for a review , see Herz et al . , 2013 ) . Biological importance of the SETD3 methyltransferase Several reports describing the role of SETD3 in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , myocyte differentiation ( Eom et al . , 2011 ) , cell response to hypoxic conditions ( Cohn et al . , 2016 ) and tumorigenesis ( Pires - Luı´s et al . , 2015 ; Cheng et al . , 2017 ) have been pub - lished to date . Some of these studies identified the methylation of histones as a primary mechanism of SETD3 action ( Kim et al . , 2011 ; Eom et al . , 2011 ) , whereas others suggested that the enzyme may instead modify non - histone substrates that are present in the cytosol ( Chen et al . , 2013 ; Cohn et al . , 2016 ) . The existence of two distinct domains in SETD3 , i . e . SET and Rubisco LSMT Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 23 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology substrate - binding domains , has been suggested to be the structural basis for such dual substrate specificity ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . Our results identify b - actin as a novel substrate of SETD3 and show that disruption of its activity leads to the depletion of F - actin and a loss of cytoskeleton integrity . This observation is probably explained by an increased rate of depolymerization of the non - methylated actin filaments . As a result , there is an accelerated conversion of a more structurally stable ATP - F - actin into a less stable ADP - F - actin , as also shown for a hypomethylated form of recombinant actin in vitro ( Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , the biochemical role of the methylated H73 residue is likely to contribute to stabilizing the structure of monomers that build the ATP - F - actin and to delay the intermolecular conformational rearrangements of F - actin that complement the hydrolysis of ATP . This conclusion finds at least par - tial confirmation in the thermal stability assay , which shows that the methylated actin derived from the wildtype HAP1 cells is clearly more thermo - stable than the non - methylated one ( SETD3 - KO cells ) ( see Figure 14 ) . Taken together , our results show that the phenotype that we have identified in Setd3 - deficient human HAP - 1 cells is caused by the absence of the catalytic activity of SETD3 , rather than by a non - catalytic or actin - stabilizing interaction between SETD3 and actin filaments . The inherent instability of F - actin in Setd3 - deficient HAP1 cells is likely to be at the origin of the increased lactate production by these cells . Both the polymerization and the depolymerization of actin filaments occur continuously even in resting cells and constitute a major energy drain , causing up to 50 % of total ATP consumption in vertebrate cells ( Kudryashov and Reisler , 2013 ) . Thus , the destabilization that leads to the accelerated degradation of hypomethylated F - actin probably drives an increasing demand for ATP that could be fulfilled by shifting the cell metabolism towards glycoly - sis . The phenotype of Setd3 - deficient cells is therefore somewhat similar to that of malignant cells , suggesting that SETD3 activity may play a role in suppressing tumor development . Indeed , the hypomethylation of actin was observed in rat cells following their transformation with the Src oncogen ( Chiou et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , the enzymatically inactive SET - domain - loss form of SETD3 was shown to function as a dominant - negative mutant , promoting oncogenesis in human cells ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) , most probably by blocking the methylation of an unknown SETD3 substrate . It is tempting to speculate that actin could be this substrate . Conclusions In the current investigation , we have identified the rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase as SETD3 , an enzyme catalyzing the extremely well - conserved methylation of H73 in b - actin . The SETD3 enzyme is therefore the first protein - histidine methyltransferase to be identified in verte - brates and the first SET - domain - containing enzyme possibly displaying a dual methyltransferase specificity towards both Lys and His residues in proteins . SETD3 is responsible for the methylation of H73 in human and Drosophila actin , and a loss of SETD3 activity in human HAP1 cells induces pheno - typic changes resembling those present in cancer cells , suggesting that the hypomethylation of actin might be involved in tumorigenesis . Finally , this work also shows that non - native protein substrates might be useful tools in the search for novel protein methyltransferases . Note added in proof While this paper was in production , similar and complementary data describing the identification of SETD3 as the actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase was accepted for publication ( Wilkinson et al . , 2018 ) . Since the work was independently carried out by both research groups and equally contributes to reveal the biochemical importance of SETD3 enzyme as the actin - specific H73 N - methyltransferase , we ask the authors referring to the function SETD3 in their future publications to mention both this paper , as well as Wilkinson et al . ( 2018 ) .

Assay of the actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferases activity Protein substrates Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of the [ 3 H ] methyl group from S - [ methyl - 3 H ] adenosyl - L - methionine ( [ 3 H ] SAM ) into homogenous recombinant human ( mammalian ) b - actin or its mutated form in which histidine 73 was replaced by an alanine residue ( H73A ) . The stan - dard incubation mixture ( 0 . 11 ml ) contained 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 2 , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 2 m M protein substrate and 1 m M [ 1 H + 3 H ] SAM ( » 400 (cid:2) 10 3 cpm ) .

The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme preparation and carried out at 37 ˚ C for 15 min unless otherwise described . Protein methylation was linear for at least 15 min under all of the conditions studied . By analogy to assays of nonribosomal peptide synthetase activity ( Richardt et al . , 2003 ; Drozak et al . , 2014 ) , the incuba - tion was stopped by the addition of 0 . 1 ml of the reaction mixture to 0 . 025 ml of bovine serum albu - min ( BSA ) ( 1 mg ) and 0 . 8 ml of ice - cold 10 % ( w / v ) trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) .

Peptide substrates The enzyme - dependent methylation of synthetic peptides — Peptide H ( YPIEHGIVT ) and Peptide A ( YPIEAGIVT ) , analogs of methylation sites in mammalian b - actin , or peptide H3N4 ( STGGVK ) , corre - sponding to a putative methylation site in mouse histone H3 . 3 — was determined by measuring the incorporation of the [ 3 H ] methyl group from [ 3 H ] SAM into a corresponding peptide . The composition of a standard incubation mixture was similar to that described above , excepting that protein sub - strates were replaced by peptides at 2 mM concentration . Blanks containing no peptides were included in all assays . The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme preparation and carried out at 37 ˚ C for the time periods indicated in the figure captions . The incubation was stopped by the addition of 0 . 1 ml of the reaction medium to 0 . 2 ml of ice - cold 10 % ( w / v ) HClO 4 . The samples were Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 .

After neutralization of the supernatant with 3 M K 2 CO 3 / 3 M KOH , the salts were removed by centrifugation ( 13 , 000 (cid:2) g for 10 min ) and the clear supernatant was diluted five times with 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 . 2 ml of the diluted supernatant was applied to Dowex 50W - X4 columns ( 1 ml , Na + form ) and equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 . The columns were washed with 3 (cid:2) 2 ml of 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , and the resulting fractions contained ( non ) methylated peptides H and A . Methylated peptide H3N4 was eluted with 3 (cid:2) 2 ml of 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , containing 0 . 5 M NaCl . To elute a non - consumed [ 1 H + 3 H ] SAM , the columns were washed with 3 (cid:2) 2 ml of 1 M NH 4 OH . In addition , in experiments in which peptide H3N4 was the substrate of the SETD3 enzyme , fractions eluted with ammonium solution were dried out at 60 ˚ C for 48 hr to break down [ 1 H + 3 H ] SAM ( Parks and Schlenk , 1958 ) . The remaining resi - dues were dissolved in 2 ml of 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) and refractionated on Dowex 50W - X4 columns to verify the possible presence of di - and tri - methylated forms of peptide H3N4 . No such polymethy - lated derivatives of peptide H3N4 were detected . In all cases , the samples to be counted were mixed with 10 ml of scintillation fluid ( Ultima Gold ) and the incorporated radioactivity was analyzed with a Beckman LS6000 IC liquid scintillation counter . Protein purification Purification of rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase A myofibrillar extract of rat skeletal muscle was prepared as described by Vijayasarathy and Nara - singa Rao ( 1987 ) . Briefly , rat leg muscles ( 200 g ) from 18 male WAG rats , aged 3 months , were homogenized in a Waring Blender 7011HS with three volumes ( w / v ) of buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM DTT , 250 mM sucrose , 5 m g / ml leupeptin and 5 m g / ml antipain . The homoge - nate was centrifuged for 15 min at 10 , 000 (cid:2) g at 4 ˚ C . The pellet was resuspended in 2400 ml of borate buffer ( 39 mM potassium borate , pH 7 . 2 , 275 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 3 m g / ml leupeptin and 3 m g / ml antipain ) , extracted by shaking at 160 rpm for 1 hr at 5 ˚ C and centrifuged for 15 min at 10 , 000 (cid:2) g at 4 ˚ C . The resulting supernatant solution ( 2400 ml ) was then fractionated between 0 % and 20 % concentration ( w / v ) of PEG 4000 . The 0 – 20 % precipitate was dissolved in 1000 ml of buffer A ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM DTT , 3 m g / ml leupeptin and 3 m g / ml antipain ) , centrifuged for 20 min at 25 , 000 (cid:2) g at 4 ˚ C and filtered through six layers of gauze to remove fat particles . The clarified supernatant was applied to a DEAE - Sepharose column ( 350 ml bed volume ) equili - brated with buffer A . The column was washed with 500 ml of buffer A and developed with a NaCl gradient ( 0 – 1 M in 962 ml ) in buffer A , before fractions ( 6 . 5 ml ) were collected . The enzymatically active fractions of the DEAE - Sepharose column ( 84 ml ) were diluted to 350 ml with buffer A and applied to a Q - Sepharose column ( 100 ml bed volume ) equilibrated with the same buffer . The col - umn was washed with 360 ml of buffer A and the retained protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient ( 0 – 0 . 95 M in 500 ml in buffer A ) before fractions ( 5 ml ) were collected . The active fractions of the Q - Sepharose column ( 64 ml ) were pooled , supplemented with solid NaCl so that a final salt concen - tration in the sample equal to 0 . 6 M was reached , and applied to a Phenyl - Sepharose six column ( 40 ml bed volume ) equilibrated with buffer B ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 2 , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 2 m g / ml leupeptin and 2 m g / ml antipain ) containing 0 . 6 M NaCl . The hydrophobic interaction column was washed with 100 ml of buffer B with NaCl and the retained protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient ( 600 – 0 mM in 360 ml in buffer B ) . Fractions ( 5 ml ) were collected . The enzymatically active fractions of the Phenyl - Sepharose column ( 93 ml ) were pooled and loaded onto a HiScreen Blue - Sepharose column ( 4 . 7 ml bed volume ) equilibrated with buffer B . The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer B and developed with a NaCl gradient ( 0 – 1 . 5 M in 70 ml ) in buffer B , before fractions ( 3 ml ) were collected . The active fractions of the HiScreen Blue - Sepharose column ( 27 ml ) were pooled , supple - mented with 100 mM KCl , 2 mM ATP and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , and concentrated to 2 . 5 ml in Vivaspin - 20 ultrafiltration devices . Two milliliters of the ultrafiltrate were loaded onto a Superdex 200 16 / 60 col - umn ( 120 ml bed volume ) equilibrated with buffer C ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 2 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 m g / ml leupeptin and 2 m g / ml antipain ) . The gel filtration column was then developed with 140 ml of buffer C and 3 ml fractions were collected . To obtain more puri - fied enzyme preparations for a tandem mass spectrometry , the most active fraction ( № 14 , 2 . 5 ml ) from the Superdex 200 purification step was loaded onto a Reactive Red 120 - Agarose column ( 1 . 5 ml bed volume ) equilibrated with buffer C . The column was first washed with 6 ml of buffer C and Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 .

All purification steps were performed at 4 ˚ C and the enzymatic preparation was stored at (cid:0) 70 ˚ C between steps . Overexpression and purification of the recombinant b - actin inclusion - body protein Plasmid pCOLD I encoding human b - actin ( ACTB , GenBank : NM _ 001101 . 4 , pCOLD I / b - actin ) was a kind gift from Dr . Minoru Tamura ( Ehime University , Japan ) and was prepared as described by Tamura et al . ( 2011 ) . For b - actin production , E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) ( Agilent , USA ) cells were transformed with the DNA construct and a single colony was selected to start an over - night pre - culture . 500 mL of LB broth ( with 100 m g / mL ampicilin ) was inoculated with 50 ml of the pre - culture and incubated at 37 ˚ C and 200 rpm until an OD600 of 0 . 5 was reached . The culture was placed on ice for 20 min ( cold - shock ) and isopropyl b - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) was added to a final concentration of 0 . 2 mM to induce protein expression . Cells were incubated for 20 hr at 15 ˚ C , 200 rpm , and harvested by centri - fugation ( 6000 (cid:2) g for 10 min ) . The cell paste was resuspended in 27 . 5 ml lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM ADP , 0 . 5 mM PMSF , 2 m g / ml leupeptin and 2 m g / ml anti - pain , together with 0 . 2 mg / ml hen egg white lysozyme ( BioShop ) , and 1000 U Viscolase ( A and A Biotechnology , Poland ) . The cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and , after thawing and vortexing , the extracts were centrifuged at 4 ˚ C ( 20 , 000 (cid:2) g for 30 min ) . The pellet , containing inclusion bodies , was completely resuspended in buffer A ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 2M urea , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 5 mM DTT and 2 mM EDTA ) with the use of Potter - Elvehjem homoge - nizer and centrifuged at 4 ˚ C ( 20 , 000 (cid:2) g for 10 min ) . The resulting pellet was then subjected to a further two rounds of sequential wash in buffer B ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 5 mM DTT and 2 mM EDTA ) and buffer C ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , and 0 . 5 M NaCl ) . The washed inclusion bodies were finally solubilized in loading buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 6 M guanidine HCl , 0 . 5 M NaCl , and 10 mM imidazole ) and applied onto a HisTrap FF column ( 5 ml ) equilibrated with the same buffer . The column was washed with 20 ml of loading buffer and the bound protein was refolded by the use of a linear gradient of 6 – 0 M guanidine HCl in loading buffer ( 40 ml for 20 min ) . Next , the col - umn was washed with 15 ml of loading buffer without guanidine HCl and the retained proteins were eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole ( 25 ml of 40 mM , 25 ml of 60 mM and 20 ml of 500 mM ) . The recombinant proteins were eluted with 500 mM imidazole in homogeneous form as con - firmed by SDS - PAGE ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The b - actin preparation was immedi - ately desalted on PD - 10 columns equilibrated with 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , 6 % sucrose , 2 m g / ml leupeptin and 2 m g / ml antipain . The purified b - actin was stored at (cid:0) 70 ˚ C . Overexpression and purification of the soluble recombinant b - actin Plasmid pCOLD I encoding human b - actin ( pCOLD I / b - actin ) was used as a template for PCR amplifi - cation of b - actin cDNA . The resulting ORF was then cloned into pESC - URA yeast expression vector ( pESC - URA / b - actin ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742 strain ( EUROSCARF , Germany ) was trans - formed with the above - mentioned plasmid using the high - efficiency lithium acetate transformation method ( Gietz and Woods , 2002 ) . The resulting yeast strain was designated as BY4742 / b - actin . The method for the purification of recombinant b - actin expressed in S . cerevisiae was that reported by Karlsson ( 1988 ) . BY4742 / b - actin was cultivated in 500 ml of SG medium ( 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids , 2 % galactose , supplemented with histidine , leucine and lysine ) for 24 hr . Cells were collected , washed with water , and suspended in 30 ml of buffer C ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , and 0 . 3 mM PMSF ) . After the addition of 100 U of DNase I , cells were homogenized in Braun MSK cell homogenizer using glass beads ( B . Braun Melsungen ) . Crude lysate was centrifuged ( 5000 (cid:2) g , 5 min ) , diluted twice with the buffer , and applied to the Ni - NTA - agarose column ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Next , the column was washed with 30 ml of buffer C supple - mented with 8 mM imidazole , and retained proteins were eluted with buffer C containing 500 mM imidazole ( » 15 ml , 0 . 7 ml fractions ) . Protein concentration in each fraction was estimated by SDS - PAGE and the most concentrated samples were taken for further procedures . Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 30 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology To obtain a yeast - produced refolded human b - actin , pellet of yeast cells ( 1000 ml culture ) was suspended in 30 ml of buffer D ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 1 mM DTT , and 100 U of DNase I ) and homogenized in a Braun MSK cell homogenizer . Crude lysate was then supplemented with 6 M guanidine HCl and 10 mM imidazole , centrifuged ( 20 , 000 (cid:2) g , 20 min ) and applied on a HisTrap FF column ( 5 ml ) . The subsequent on - column refolding and purification of b - actin was per - formed as described for E . coli - derived protein . For preparation of b - actin complexes with either cofilin or profilin ( see below ) , an equimolar amount of the recombinant homogenous actin - binding protein was mixed with the yeast - produced b - actin and dialyzed twice against 1000 ml of dialysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM DTT , 6 % sucrose , and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) , for 2 hr in 250 ml and then overnight in 500 ml . When obtaining b - actin complexed with either ADP or ATP , samples eluted from Ni - NTA - agarose were dialyzed under the same conditions against dialysis buffer containing 50 m M of an appropriate nucleotide . In all cases , dialyzed protein preparation was concentrated using an Amicon 10K device ( Merck , Germany ) . Overexpression in COS - 7 cells and purification of the recombinant SETD3 proteins Rat total RNA was prepared from 200 mg of leg muscles with the use of TriPure reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions , whereas human skeletal muscle total RNA was purchased from Clontech ( USA ) . cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus - reverse transcriptase ( Thermo - Fermentas ) , with oligo ( dT ) 18 primer and 2 . 5 m g total RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The open reading frames encoding rat ( NCBI Reference Sequence : XM _ 002726774 . 2 ) and human ( NM _ 032233 . 2 ) SETD3 protein were PCR - amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 M betaine . The SETD3 genes were amplified using 5 0 primers containing the initiator codon pre - ceded by the Kozak consensus sequence ( Kozak , 1987 ) and an KpnI site , and 3 0 primers in which the original stop codon was replaced by an amino - acid - coding codon flanked by a NotI site ( for primer sequences , see Table 5 ) . The amplified DNA products of the expected size were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes , cloned in the pEF6 / Myc - His A expression vector ( Invitro - gen , USA ) ( which allows the production of proteins with an C - terminal His 6 - tag ) , and verified by Table 5 .

The resulting vector was designated as pEF6 / SETD3 . For transfections , COS - 7 cells ( Cell Lines Service , Germany ) were plated in 100 mm Petri dishes at a cell density of 1 . 7 (cid:2) 10 6 or 2 . 1 (cid:2) 10 6 cells per plate in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin , and 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum , and grown in a humidified incubator under 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 ˚ C . After 24 hr , each plate was transfected with 7 – 8 m g of either unmodified pEF6 / Myc - His A vector or pEF6 / SETD3 using the TurboFect transfection reagent according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer . After 48 hr , the culture medium was removed , the cells were washed with 5 ml phos - phate buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 2 , containing 10 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 5 m g / ml leupeptin and 5 m g / ml antipain . The cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and , after thawing and vortexing , the extracts were centrifuged at 4 ˚ C ( 20 , 000 (cid:2) g for 30 min ) to remove insoluble material . For the purification of recombinant SETD3 proteins , the supernatant of the COS - 7 lysate ( 13 – 18 ml ) was diluted 3 - fold with buffer A ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 400 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , 30 mM imid - azole , 3 m g / ml leupeptin and 3 m g / ml antipain ) and applied onto a HisTrap HP column ( 1 ml ) equili - brated with the same buffer . The column was washed with 6 – 10 ml buffer A and the retained protein was eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole ( 6 ml of 60 mM , 6 ml of 150 mM and 6 ml of 300 mM ) in buffer A . The recombinant proteins were eluted with 150 mM imidazole in homoge - neous form , as confirmed by SDS - PAGE ( see Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) .

The yield of recombinant proteins was 0 . 5 – 0 . 6 mg of homogenous protein per about 25 – 40 mg of soluble COS - 7 cell protein . The purified enzymes were aliquoted and stored at (cid:0) 70 ˚ C . Repeated freeze - thawing was avoided because it impairs SETD3 activity . Overexpression in E . coli and purification of the recombinant SETD3 proteins Bacterial expression plasmids for human and rat SETD3 fused to an N - terminal His 6 - tag were con - structed by sub - cloning the open reading frames from the pEF6 / SETD3 plasmids into the pCOLD I vector ( Takara Bio , Kusatsu , Japan ) , using KpnI and XbaI enzymes ( pCOLD I / SETD3 ) . For protein production , E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells were transformed with an appropriate DNA con - struct and a single colony was selected to start an over - night pre - culture . 500 mL of LB broth ( with 100 m g / mL ampicilin ) was inoculated with 50 ml of the pre - culture and incubated at 37 ˚ C and 200 rpm until an OD600 of 0 . 6 was reached . The culture was placed on ice for 20 min ( cold - shock ) and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0 . 3 mM to induce protein expression . Cells were incu - bated for 16 hr at 13 ˚ C , 200 rpm , and harvested by centrifugation ( 6000 (cid:2) g for 10 min ) .

The cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and , after thawing and vortexing , the extracts were centrifuged at 4 ˚ C ( 20000 (cid:2) g for 20 min ) . For the purification of recombinant SETD3 proteins , the supernatant of E . coli lysate ( 22 ml ) was diluted 3 - fold with buffer A ( 50 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , 30 mM imidazole , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) and applied onto a HisTrap FF column ( 5 ml ) equilibrated with the same buffer . The column was then washed with 35 ml buffer A , and the retained proteins were eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole ( 15 ml of 60 mM , 16 ml of 150 mM and 16 ml of 300 mM ) in buffer A . The recombinant proteins were present in both 150 mM and 300 mM imidazole fractions ( see Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) , but only SETD3 protein eluted at the highest con - centration of imidazole , exhibiting > 95 % purity as confirmed by SDS - PAGE , was further processed . The enzyme preparation was desalted onto PD - 10 columns equilibrated with 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT and 6 % sucrose . The yield of recombinant proteins was 6 . 6 mg and 8 . 2 mg of homogenous rSETD3 and hSETD3 , respectively , per 500 ml of culture . The purified proteins were aliquoted and stored at (cid:0) 70 ˚ C . Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 33 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology pellet was resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer consisting of 25 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM PMSF , 5 m g / ml leupeptin and 5 m g / ml antipain , together with 0 . 25 mg / ml hen egg white lysozyme ( BioShop ) and 25 U DNase I ( Roche ) . The cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and , after thawing and vortexing , the extracts were centrifuged at 4 ˚ C ( 20 , 000 (cid:2) g for 30 min ) . For protein purification , the supernatant of the E . coli lysate ( 10 ml ) was diluted 3 - fold with buffer A ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 2 , 400 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , 30 mM imidazole , 1 mM DTT , 3 m g / ml leu - peptin and 3 m g / ml antipain ) and applied onto a HisTrap FF column ( 5 ml ) equilibrated with the same buffer . The column was washed with 20 – 30 ml buffer A and the retained protein was eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole ( 25 ml of 60 mM , 20 ml of 150 mM and 20 ml of 300 mM ) in buffer A . The recombinant proteins were eluted with 150 – 300 mM imidazole in homogeneous form , as confirmed by SDS - PAGE ( not shown ) . The enzyme preparations were desalted onto PD - 10 col - umns equilibrated with 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 6 % sucrose , 2 m g / ml leupep - tin and 2 m g / ml antipain . The yield of recombinant proteins was 1 . 2 mg and 3 . 1 mg of homogenous adenine deaminase and SAH nucleosidase , respectively , per 200 ml of E . coli culture . The purified enzymes were aliquoted and stored at (cid:0) 70 ˚ C . Identification of the rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase by tandem mass spectrometry A preliminary SDS - PAGE analysis of the peak activity fractions from the Reactive Red 120 - agarose purification step revealed the presence of very faint protein bands with a low protein content , consequently the fractions were 15 - fold concentrated in a Vivaspin - 500 ultrafiltration device and reanalyzed by SDS - PAGE . All bands present in the concentrated fractions were cut from a 10 % gel and digested with trypsin . In - gel digestions of the peptides were performed as described ( Shevchenko et al . , 2006 ) . Peptides were analyzed by nanoUPLC - tandem mass spectrometry employing Acquity nanoUPLC coupled with a Synapt G2 HDMS Q - TOF mass spectrometer ( Waters , Milford , USA ) fitted with a nanospray source and working in MS ^ E mode under default parameters . Briefly , the products of in - gel protein digestion were loaded onto a Waters Symmetry C18 trapping column ( 20 mm (cid:2) 180 m m ) coupled to the Waters BEH130 C18 UPLC column ( 250 mm (cid:2) 75 m m ) . The peptides were eluted from these columns in a 1 – 85 % gradient of acetonitrile in water ( both con - taining 0 . 1 % formic acid ) at a flow rate of 0 . 3 m l / min . The peptides were directly eluted into the mass spectrometer . Data were acquired and analyzed using MassLynx 4 . 1 software ( Waters , USA ) and ProteinLynx Global Server 2 . 4 software ( PLGS , Waters , USA ) with a False Discovery Rate (cid:20) 4 % . To identify actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase , the complete rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) refer - ence proteome was downloaded from the NCBI Protein database , randomized and used as a data - bank for the MS / MS software . Generation of the HAP1 cell lines deficient in SETD3 by the CRISPR / Cas9 method Human - derived HAP1 cells ( Horizon Discovery , Waterbeach , UK ) have a haploid karyotype except for a disomy of chromosome 8 ( 25 , XY , + 8 , Ph + ) and are therefore considered near - haploid . The cell line expresses Setd3 gene at the level of 32 . 04 transcripts per kilobase million ( https : / / www . horizon - discovery . com / human - setd3 - knockout - cell - line - hzghc84193 ) . Since Setd3 gene is on chromosome 14 , all generated Setd3 - defficent HAP1 cells will show the complete loss of SETD3 expression . The parental cells were therefore used to create HAP1 cell lines that are deficient in SETD3 by using CRISPR / Cas9 technology . Two CRISPR / Cas9 constructs were generated to target exon 4 of the human Setd3 gene by ligat - ing two different sets of annealed primer pairs ( CRISPR - hSETD3 - s1 CACCGgttctgtcgagggttttgaaa , CRISPR - hSETD3 - as1 AAACtttcaaaaccctcgacagaacC and CRISPR - hSETD3 - s2 CACCGgaggcccatttcat - tagatc , CRISPR - hSETD3 - as2 AAACgatctaatgaaatgggcctcC ) . The annealed primer pairs were ligated into the vector pSpCas9n ( BB ) (cid:0) 2A - Puro ( PX462 ) V2 . 0 ( a gift from F . Zhang , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; Addgene plasmid no . 62987 ) ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) digested by BbsI . Constructs were validated by sequencing ( Beckman Coulter Genomics ) . HAP1 cells were cultured in IMDM ( Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium ) containing 10 % FBS , 2 mM L - glutamine and penicillin / streptomycin ( Thermo - Life Technologies ) . Cells were transfected with the CRISPR constructs exactly as described Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 34 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology in Collard et al . , 2016 . Genomic DNA from puromycin - resistant clones was used to PCR - amplify the regions encompassing the targeted site and the PCR products were sequenced to evaluate the gene modification present in each clone . The three SETD3 - KO clones that were ultimately selected for further studies presented the following modifications : clone KO - A1 , a 16 bp deletion after Phe71 , which introduces a frame shift and a premature stop codon at position 75 ; clone KO - A3 , a 4 bp deletion and 6 bp insertion that introduce a frame shift after Met83 and a premature stop codon at position 109 ; and clone KO - A5 , a 18 bp deletion and 107 bp insertion after Trp85 , with a prema - ture stop codon at position 292 . The absence of SETD3 protein from each SETD3 - KO cell lines was confirmed by western blotting performed as described previously ( Drozak et al . , 2013 ) , with the use of rabbit polyclonal primary antibody against human SETD3 ( ab174662 , Abcam , UK ) and a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary IgG antibody ( AS09602 , Agrisera , Vannas , Sweden ) . Product analysis Detection of in vitro methylated b - actin by tandem mass spectrometry To obtain a sufficient amount of the methylated b - actin formed in the reaction catalyzed by recombi - nant rat or human SETD3 protein for mass spectrometry analysis , the reaction mixture was scaled up . Briefly , 15 m g recombinant human b - actin was incubated for 90 min at 37 ˚ C in 70 m l of a reaction mixture containing 25 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 2 , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 20 m M MnCl 2 , 6 % sucrose , 20 – 30 m M [ 2 H ] SAM , 4 . 5 – 9 . 0 m g SAH nucleosidase and 1 . 75 – 3 . 5 m g adenine deaminase in the absence or presence of 1 . 1 – 3 . 5 m g SETD3 protein . The incubation was stopped by the addition of 30 m l of the reaction mixture to 10 m l 4 (cid:2) Laemmli buffer and by heating the sample for 5 min at 95 ˚ C , while the remaining 40 m l of the mixture was flesh - frozen in LN 2 and stored at (cid:0) 70 ˚ C . The yield of b - actin methylation was about 30 % , as determined for the parallel labeling reaction in the presence of [ 2 H + 3 H ] SAM . For MS / MS analysis of deuterated protein , 35 m l of denatured sample ( » 18 m g protein ) was sepa - rated in 10 % SDS - PAGE and silver stained ( Shevchenko et al . , 1996 ) . The bands corresponding to b - actin were excised from the gels , destained and digested with trypsin according to the methods described in Shevchenko et al . , 2006 . In addition , 18 m l of the flesh - frozen sample ( 12 m g protein ) was trypsin - digested ‘in solution’ for 16 hr at 30 ˚ C in 30 m l of the reaction mixture containing 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 and 1 . 5 m g trypsin ( MS grade , Sigma - Aldrich ) . The digestion reaction was terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1 % . Resulting peptides were ana - lyzed by nanoUPLC - tandem mass spectrometry , as described above in the section ‘Identification of rat actin - specific histidine N - methyltransferase by tandem mass spectrometry’ . To identify actin pep - tides , the full amino - acid sequence of recombinant human b - actin in fusion with the His 6 - tag at the N - terminus was used as a databank for the MS / MS software . Detection of the trideuterium - methylated peptides was performed in a fully automatic mode by PLGS 2 . 4 software ( Waters , USA ) , following its update by adding trideuterium - methylation ( + 17 . 03448 Da ) of Cys , Asp , Asn , His , Lys , Arg , Glu and Gln residues as a possible modification of peptides . Detection of methylated b - actin from HAP1 human cell lines by tandem mass spectrometry HAP1 wildtype ( WT - A1 and WT - A2 ) and SETD3 - KO cells ( KO - A1 and KO - A3 ) were cultured in IMDM containing 10 % FBS , 2 mM L - glutamine and penicillin / streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) , each in four 10 cm diameter plates . At confluence , the medium was rapidly removed , the plates were washed with 5 ml cold PBS and each of them scraped in 0 . 8 ml of buffer A ( 25 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 20 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 m g / ml leupeptin and 2 . 5 m g / ml antipain ) and combined to collect the cells . The four solu - ble cell extracts were prepared by two cycles of freezing the cell suspension in liquid nitrogen and thawing before vortex - mixing and centrifuging for 15 min at 15 , 000 (cid:2) g and 4 ˚ C to recover soluble proteins . To purify the actin partially , the cell lysates were diluted 5 - fold in buffer A ( 20 ml final volume ) and loaded onto a 1 ml - HiTrap Q HP ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with the same buffer . The column was washed with 6 ml of buffer A and proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient ( 20 – 750 mM in 20 ml buffer A ) . The elution fractions ( 1 ml ) were analysed by SDS - PAGE followed by Coomassie Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 35 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology blue staining and by western blotting using a rabbit anti - actin antibody ( A2066 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . The actin band of the richest fraction was cut out of the gel and digested with trypsin . The resulting peptides were analysed by LC - MS / MS with a LTQ XL ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) equipped with a microflow ESI source interfaced with a Dionex Ultimate Plus Dual gradient pump , a Switchos column switching device , and a Famos Autosampler ( Dionex , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) as described ( Houddane et al . , 2017 ) . Raw data files were then analyzed by bioin - formatics using Proteome Discoverer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Peak lists were generated using the application spectrum selector in the Proteome Discoverer 1 . 4 package . From raw files , MS / MS spec - tra were exported as individual files in the . dta format with the following settings : peptide mass range , 400 – 3500 Da ; minimal total ion intensity , 500 ; and minimal number of fragment ions , 12 . The resulting peak lists were searched using SequestHT against a human protein database obtained from Uniprot and containing only actin sequences . The following parameters were used : trypsin was selected with semi - proteolytic cleavage only after lysine and arginine ; the number of internal cleav - age sites was set to 2 ; the mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions was 1 . 0 Da ; and the con - sidered dynamic modifications were + 15 . 99 Da for oxidized methionine , + 14 . 00 Da for methylation on histidine and + 42 . 00 Da for acetylation of N - terminus or lysines . Peptide spectral matches ( PSM ) were filtered using charge - state versus cross - correlation scores ( Xcorr ) and methylation sites were validated manually . Detection of actin methylation in Drosophila melanogaster by tandem mass spectrometry To investigate whether the absence of SETD3 in D . melanogaster also prevented actin methylation , we prepared protein extracts by homogenizing approximately 20 larvae from wildtype or SETD3 KO flies ( Tiebe et al . , 2018 ) in 0 . 5 ml of 25 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 with 2 . 5 m g / ml of leupeptin and antipain . After centrifugation ( 15 min at 16 000 (cid:2) g ) , the supernatant was recovered , protein concentration was measured ( Bradford , 1976 ) and 10 m g of total proteins were digested with trypsin and used for LC - MS / MS analysis . Peptides were dissolved in solvent A ( 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) in 2 % ace - tonitrile ( ACN ) ) , directly loaded onto reversed - phase pre - column ( Acclaim PepMap 100 , Thermo Sci - entific ) and eluted in backflush mode . Peptide ( 250 ng ) separation was performed using a reversed - phase analytical column ( Acclaim PepMap RSLC , 0 . 075 (cid:2) 250 mm , Thermo Scientific ) with a linear gradient of 4 – 27 . 5 % solvent B ( 0 . 1 % formic acid ( FA ) in 98 % ACN ) for 100 min , 27 . 5 – 40 % solvent B for 10 min , 40 – 95 % solvent B for 1 min and holding at 95 % for the last 10 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nl / min on an EASY - nLC 1000 ultra - performance liquid chromatography ( UPLC ) system . The peptides were analyzed by an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid mass spectrometer ( ThermoFisher Sci - entific ) . The peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry ( MS / MS ) in Fusion Lumos coupled online to the UPLC . Intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a res - olution of 120 , 000 . Peptides were selected for MS / MS using a higher - energy C - trap dissociation ( HCD ) setting of 30 ; ion fragments were detected in the ion trap . A data - dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS / MS scans was applied for the top 20 precursor ions above a threshold ion count of 5 . 0E3 in the MS survey scan with 30 . 0 s dynamic exclusion . The electrospray voltage applied was 2 . 1 kV . MS1 spectra were obtained with an automatic gain control ( AGC ) target of 4E5 ions and a maximum injection time of 50 ms , whereas MS2 spectra were acquired with an AGC target of 5E3 ions and a maximum injection time of 300 ms . For MS scans , the m / z scan range was 350 to 1500 . The resulting MS / MS data were processed using the Sequest HT search engine within Proteome Discoverer 2 . 2 against a protein database con - taining Drosophila melanogaster sequences obtained from Swissprot ( 4810 entries , version 27 10 2017 ) . Trypsin was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to two missed cleavages , four modifica - tions per peptide and up to five charges . Mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0 . 6 Da for fragment ions . Oxidation on Met , carbamidomethyl on Cys and methylation on His ( + 14 . 015 Da ) were considered as variable modifications . False discovery rate ( FDR ) was assessed using Perco - lator and thresholds for protein , peptide and modification site were specified at 1 % . Kwiatkowski et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e37921 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 36 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Phenotypic analysis Glucose consumption and lactate production HAP1 cells ( 150 (cid:2) 10 3 ) were seeded in 12 - well plates and incubated in IMDM with 10 % FBS for 40 hr with a change of medium every 20 hr . Following 40 hr incubation , cell confluency was about 90 % and the fresh medium was added to start the final incubation lasting for the next 20 hr . To finish the incubation , 1 ml of the culture medium was transferred to 100 m l of 35 % HClO 4 and centrifuged at 10 , 000 (cid:2) g for 10 min , before the resulting supernatant was neutralized with 3 M K 2 CO 3 / 3 M KOH . The lactate produced was determined spectrophotometrically using lactate dehydrogenase ( Roche ) ( Noll , 1984 ) , whereas glucose consumption was measured in a spectrophotometric assay that uses hexokinase and glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( Roche ) ( Kunst and Draeger , 1984 ) . Adherent cells were washed three times with 3 ml of PBS and then solubilized in 0 . 1 M NaOH containing 0 . 125 % Triton X - 100 for protein quantification ( Bradford ) to allow normalization of lactate produced and glucose consumed to biomass . Organization of actin cytoskeleton Visualization of actin filaments was performed as described Domanski et al . , 2016 Domanski et al . , 2016 . Briefly , HAP1 cells , both control and Setd 3 - KO clones , were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10 % FBS , penicillin ( 100 U / ml ) and streptomycin ( 100 m g / ml ) at 37 ˚ C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . For confocal microscopy , 5 (cid:2) 10 5 cells were seeded on a 22 (cid:2) 22 mm glass cov - erslip in a 35 mm plate . Either 24 or 48 hr after cell seeding , culture medium was removed and the cells were washed three times with PBS , fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature , permeabilized with 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 3 min and washed again three times with PBS . F - actin was visualized by staining with TRITC - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature . Nuclei were localized with Hoechst 33342 dye ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . After rinsing in PBS , coverslips were mounted using fluorescence mounting medium ( DakoCytomation - Agilent , Santa Clara , USA ) . Samples were analyzed with the use of a Zeiss Axio Observer . Z1 LSM 700 confo - cal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Plan - Apochromat 63 / 1 . 40 Oil objective ( Zeiss , Ober - kochen , Germany ) . To detect the fluorescence of TRITC - phalloidin , a 555 nm excitation line was used , and for detecting blue fluorescence of Hoechst 33342 , a 405 nm excitation line was employed . For 3D analysis , confocal Z - stacks comprising 10 – 13 optical slices were reconstructed into a 3D image using Zeiss Zen software with default settings . Analysis of the impact of actin methylation on its thermal stability For determination of the thermostability of actin protein present in cell - free lysates of HAP1 wildtype ( WT - A2 ) and SETD3 - KO cells ( KO - A3 ) , 40 m l of lysates ( 73 . 6 m g protein ) were incubated for 5 min at 4 , 30 , 40 , 43 , 46 , 49 , 52 , 55 and 60 ˚ C , followed by a 5 min incubation at 4 ˚ C . The denatured proteins were removed in the pellet following centrifugation ( 13 , 000 (cid:2) g , 10 min ) and the remaining non - denatured and still soluble proteins present in the supernatant were subsequently separated by SDS - PAGE . Soluble actin was detected by western blotting with the use of rabbit polyclonal primary antibody against vertebrate actin ( A2066 , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and a horseradish peroxidase - conju - gated goat anti - rabbit secondary IgG antibody ( AS09602 , Agrisera , Sweden ) . The quantitative analy - sis of the protein band corresponding to actin was performed by densitometry using Quantity One software ( BioRad , Hercules , USA ) . Phylogenetic analysis Sequences homologous to rat SETD3 protein ( NCBI Reference Sequence : XM _ 002726774 . 2 ) were identified by Protein Blast searches . A phylogenetic analysis was performed on the Phylogeny . fr plat - form ( www . phylogeny . fr ) ( Dereeper et al . , 2008 ) . Amino acid sequences were aligned with MUSCLE ( v3 . 7 ) ( Edgar , 2004 ) . After alignment , ambiguous regions were removed with Gblocks ( v0 . 91b ) ( Cas - tresana , 2000 ) . Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Phylogenetic estimation using Maxi - mum Likelihood ( PhyML ) ( Guindon and Gascuel , 2003 ) with the WAG model for amino acid substitution ( Whelan and Goldman , 2001 ) . The final tree was customized with the editing interface TreeDyn ( Chevenet et al . , 2006 ) . A confidence level was assessed using the approximate likelihood ratio test ( aLRT ) ( minimum of SH - like and c 2 - based parametric ) ( Anisimova and Gascuel , 2006 ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 37921 37 of 42 Research article Biochemistry and Chemical Biology Analytical methods Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically according to Bradford ( 1976 ) using bovine g - globulin as a standard . When appropriate , the His 6 - tagged recombinant proteins were detected by western blot analysis , employing a mouse primary antibody against His 6 - tag ( 27 - 4710 - 01 , GE Healthcare , USA ) and a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody ( A2554 , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , as described previously ( Drozak et al . , 2013 ) . All western - blotting analyses employed chemiluminescence and signals acquisition with Amersham Hyperfilm ECL , with the pattern of the prestained protein ladder being copied from the blotting membrane onto the film using a set of felt - tip pens . Calculations V max , K M and k cat for the methyltransferase activities of the studied enzymes were calculated with Prism 4 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , USA ) using a nonlinear regression .
