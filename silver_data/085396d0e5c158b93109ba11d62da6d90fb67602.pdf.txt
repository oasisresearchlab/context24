Asthma is listed as a 48 risk factor in some guidelines , although children with asthma appear to not be at increased risk of 49 severe respiratory outcomes compared to children without asthma during the pandemic . 50 Differentiating COVID - 19 from allergic disease is very difficult to do in the school - aged 51 children . For school management , there is firm evidence that masks do not exacerbate underlying 52 lung conditions including asthma and evidence to date supports that children with asthma can 53 learn in - person at school as they do not appear to be at increased risk of COVID - 19 morbidity or 54 mortality . For children and adolescents , the COVID - 19 vaccine has been demonstrated to be safe 55 and well tolerated . School asthma management includes remaining on prescribed asthma 56 medications . Asthma management , as with management of all pediatric conditions , must also 57 factor in the impact of adverse social determinants and health disparities . Broadly , the pandemic 58 has also served as a call to resource stewardship and innovation and allowed practitioners to 59 consider how this may impact asthma care moving forward . 60 61 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 62 63 Introduction 64 As of October 12 , 2021 there have been over 238 million cases of COVID - 19 worldwide , 65 and over 4 . 8 million deaths . 1 In the United States , there have been more than 44 million cases 66 and more than 715 , 000 deaths to date . While the impact of the global pandemic has been 67 mitigated with mass international vaccination efforts , it remains forefront on the mind of 68 clinicians and families across the globe . 69 The pandemic has had a broad direct and indirect impact on children and their families . 70 While children infected with COVID - 19 have a better prognosis than adults 2 and severe illness is 71 less common , 3 severe illness when it occurs can be significant among those admitted to hospital 72 and is predicated by pre - existing comorbidities . 3 Data from the Centers for Disease Control and 73 Prevention ( CDC ) has demonstrated that among the 96 % of COVID - 19 cases where age was 74 known , only 8 . 1 % was among children < 18 years of age . 4 However , morbidity can be high and 75 there are racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes . 5 76 While in general preschool and school - aged children were at low risk of a direct impact 77 of COVID - 19 during the early waves of the pandemic , 6 an increase in variants of concern has 78 resulted in the possibility of increasing transmissibility rates to children as well as the possibility 79 of increased morbidity and mortality . 7 In addition , there is a rising recognition of other long - term 80 complications being seen in the pediatric population – such as long - COVID and multisystem 81 inflammatory syndrome in children ( MIS - C ) . 8 , 9 82 With the fall return to school , for families of children with asthma , as with families 83 overall , there is significant concern about ensuring the safety and security of children . 84 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Specifically , there are concerns related to the risk that asthma poses to COVID - 19 severity , and 85 how broad public health measures impact children with asthma at school . Few articles have 86 synthesized an approach to school - based management among children with underlying 87 conditions such as asthma , who may be at real – or perceived – increased risk . As a result , the 88 focus of this article is to review school asthma care during the pandemic ( Figure 1 ) . 89 90 Impact of asthma on COVID - 19 outcomes in children 91 A major factor in parental comfort with school attendance among children with asthma is 92 their risk should they acquire COVID - 19 and in particular whether asthma places children at 93 higher risk of severe COVID - 19 outcomes . There are specific underlying chronic medical 94 conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID - 19 outcomes in children . These include 95 obesity , chronic lung disease , neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy , immunodeficiency , 96 and older aged children . 10 97 While children with chronic lung disease are more likely to have severe or critical 98 COVID - 19 , asthma has in general been an exception . 4 , 6 , 11 – 16 In general , those with asthma are 99 thought to be at low risk of COVID19 severe outcomes . 17 A national prospective Canadian study 100 of 264 children admitted to hospital with COVID - 19 infection found that while 39 . 3 % of those 101 children admitted had at least one comorbidity including chronic lung disease , asthma was an 102 exception . 6 A retrospective review of COVID - 19 infection among children with asthma noted no 103 increased COVID - 19 severity independent of asthma severity and control over the year prior to 104 the pandemic . 13 In addition , a systematic review on asthma and COVID - 19 in children noted no 105 significant data that childhood asthma constitutes a risk factor for COVID infection or severity . 18 106 While one report from the CDC found 11 . 5 % of children with data had “chronic lung diseases 107 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f including asthma” and one tertiary hospital reported asthma in 23 . 9 % of children hospitalized for 108 COVID - 19 , 19 other studies have suggested perhaps even a protective risk associated with 109 atopy . 20 , 21 It has been demonstrated that downregulation of ACE2 expression on target cells 110 ( including in the lungs ) due to Th2 cytokines may actually reduce the risk of COVID - 19 111 infection in atopic children . 20 , 21 112 There is a concern that a rise in asthma exacerbations will be seen over the fall and spring 113 this year however this was not noted during the first three waves of the pandemic . 13 , 22 – 26 A study 114 on asthma - related Emergency Department ( ED ) utilization in a high - volume US children’s 115 hospital found , for the year 2020 , a dramatic reduction in asthma - related ED use ( compared to 116 the prior four years ) that was significantly below historical seasonal variation . In addition , this 117 pattern of a dramatic reduction was observed for all levels of triage acuity . 25 A retrospective 118 chart review of children < 21 years of age seen at a pediatric ED from March - June 2020 119 ( compared to the same interval in 2019 ) noted a 66 % decline in ED visits , with significant 120 declines in asthma visits ( 2 % vs 7 % ; P < . 0001 ) . 27 A study of in - person asthma encounters at a US 121 tertiary care center in 2020 ( compared to 2015 - 2019 historical reference ) noted an 87 % 122 ( outpatient ) and 84 % ( emergency and inpatient ) reduction in in - person asthma encounters during 123 the pandemic . 28 However , there has been an increase in respiratory infections this summer and 124 fall . In particular , Australia and the United States have seen a resurgence of cases of respiratory 125 syncytial virus ( RSV ) in the late summer , with predicted surges in Canada as well . 29 126 In conclusion , studies to date have not demonstrated an increased risk of severe COVID - 127 19 outcomes among children with asthma , and have in fact noted a reduction in asthma 128 healthcare utilization during COVID - 19 . While further studies are required , and asthma remains 129 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f listed as a risk factor in some guidelines , children with asthma appear to not be at increased risk 130 of severe respiratory outcomes compared to children without asthma during the pandemic . 131 132 School - Related Issues in Children With Asthma During COVID - 19 133 134 Mask Exemptions 135 Mask wearing , especially indoors , has emerged as a public health measure that 136 significantly reduces transmission of COVID - 19 and as a result has been , throughout the 137 pandemic , mandated in schools . 30 There has been significant misinformation that children with 138 asthma should not wear masks as it may impact breathing and lung function . Mask mandates and 139 exemptions have been described as a “new frontier” for clinicians and is a common request 140 among families of children with asthma . 31 141 There is firm evidence that masks do not exacerbate underlying lung conditions 32 , 33 A 142 cohort study of 47 infants and young children noted that surgical face masks were not associated 143 with any changes in respiratory parameters nor clinical signs of respiratory distress . 34 A recent 144 scoping review on the impact of masks on cardiorespiratory response to exercise found that 145 while subjective sense of dyspnea may be increased with mask wearing , the objective effects on 146 work of breathing , blood gases , and other physiological parameters are minimal with no sex - 147 based or age - based differences detected . 35 It has been noted by multiple international 148 organizations , including the Canadian Thoracic Society , that there is “NO evidence that wearing 149 a face mask will exacerbate ( cause a ‘flare up’ of ) an underlying lung condition . 32 In fact , the 150 opposite may in fact be true . There is emerging evidence that wearing a face mask at school , and 151 in other public places , can reduce spread of other common respiratory infections – such as RSV 152 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f and influenza – that are frequent causes of asthma exacerbations and might reduce the risk of 153 viral - triggered asthma exacerbations at school in children . 36 In conclusion , asthma is not an 154 indication for a mask exemption in schools . 155 156 School attendance - differentiating asthma / allergic disease from COVID - 19 157 A common frustration during the school year among families of children with asthma and 158 other atopic conditions ( in particular rhinitis ) is differentiating allergic symptoms from those of 159 COVID - 19 . This is particularly important to prevent children from missing school unnecessarily . 160 However , unfortunately , differentiating COVID - 19 from allergic disease is very difficult to do . 161 COVID - 19 symptoms can be pleiomorphic and include dramatic loss of taste and smell , 162 gastrointestinal symptoms , and fever / myalgias , and with emerging strains , symptoms may 163 change . 10 However , dry cough and shortness of breath are among the most commonly presenting 164 symptoms of both asthma as well as COVID - 19 . 37 A study of 435 patients ( although not 165 pediatric ) who presented for COVID - 19 testing at a tertiary medical center noted a high overlap 166 in symptoms of COVID - 19 and worsening asthma . 38 In fact , as noted by the American Academy 167 of Allergy , Asthma and Immunology ( AAAAI ) , it is impossible to distinguish between a viral - 168 induced asthma exacerbation and the symptoms of COVID - 19 . 39 As a result , anyone 169 symptomatic “should be considered to have COVID - 19 until testing proves otherwise . ” 39 170 A modified Delphi process has been used by the ARIA ( Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact 171 on Asthma ) - EAACI ( European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology ) - GA 2 LEN 172 ( Global Allergy and Asthma European Network ) initiative to establish a set of questions aimed at 173 distinguishing COVID - 19 from allergic conditions . 40 However , in the interim it is very difficult 174 to distinguish these conditions from COVID - 19 . 41 , 42 As a result , if there are upper or lower 175 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f respiratory symptoms , especially if atypical from a child’s standard allergic symptoms , COVID - 176 19 testing is the only way to differentiate infection from allergic symptoms including asthma and 177 rhinitis at the present time . 178 179 School attendance – virtual learning due to asthma 180 Another common question is whether asthma is an indication for virtual learning during 181 the pandemic . As previously described , the evidence to date supports that children with asthma 182 can learn in - person at school as they do not appear to be at increased risk of COVID - 19 183 morbidity or mortality . 37 , 43 Children in general are less commonly symptomatic with COVID - 19 184 than adults , and those who are symptomatic rarely require hospitalization although morbidity 185 may vary based on variants . 1 , 44 Schools are not common vectors of COVID - 19 transmission , and 186 child - to - child transmission at schools has been rare although this may change with variants of 187 concern . A study of Irish notifications of all pediatric COVID - 19 cases attending school found 188 no evidence of transmission to other children or adults within the school , as well as a variety of 189 other settings ( including music lessons and choir practice ) . 45 A retrospective study from 190 Germany of school - aged children found child - to - child transmission at schools to be rare 191 ( estimated one secondary case per roughly 24 infectious school days ) and “not the primary cause 192 of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children . ” 46 A study of nasopharyngeal swabs from 305 adults and 193 pediatric COVID - 19 cases in Canada noted that children , compared with adults , were less likely 194 to grow virus in culture and had higher cycle thresholds and lower viral concentrations , 195 “suggesting that children are not the main drivers of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . ” 47 A study of 196 all school - aged cases of COVID - 19 in Australia found only two possible cases of secondary 197 school - based transmission ( one in high school , one from a staff member to a student ) despite 198 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f close contact with 735 students and 128 school staff . 48 Regarding COVID - 19 transmission , as 199 stated in an editorial in Pediatrics , “the child is not to blame . ” 49 200 Virtual learning is associated with environmental factors that could worsen asthma 201 control including second - hand smoke exposure , prolonged exposure to indoor aeroallergens , and 202 reduced physical activity . 50 , 51 There is increasing recognition of the profound impact that remote 203 learning ( and its related consequences ) has had on children and their families , in particular those 204 facing adverse determinants of health . These include an impact on school performance including 205 lack of virtual platforms in some homes , 52 , 53 lack of access to school - based medical programs 206 and lunch programs which could worsen food insecurity , 54 impact on parental workforce , 55 , 56 and 207 broad mental health impacts 57 These adverse social determinants are also more likely to impact 208 those with poorly controlled asthma . 58 209 At times , school closures are necessary from a broad public health perspective . However , 210 on an individual level , when schools are open , asthma would not necessarily be an indication for 211 virtual learning unless other considerations are present . In addition , more broadly , it has been 212 identified that “ improving monitoring and learning assessment strategies will be critical for 213 educators and policymakers to understand what system adjustments and additional support 214 children will need to overcome the identified gaps in learning , especially for the foundational 215 skills . ” 59 216 217 218 School Attendance - COVID - 19 Vaccination 219 COVID - 19 vaccination provides the first opportunity to reduce the risk of severe 220 COVID - 19 outcomes . 60 , 61 The vaccines are safe , immunogenic , and effective . 60 , 61 The US Food 221 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has provided an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer - 222 BioNTech vaccine in adolescents aged 12 - 15 years , and children aged 5 to 11 years old . 62 , 63 223 However , broad vaccine hesitancy has been noted in families of adolescents within the United 224 States , with a survey by the CDC noting that only 55 . 5 % of parents / guardians of unvaccinated 225 adolescents would definitely or probably allow their children to receive the COVID - 19 226 vaccine . 64 The CDC has noted that “efforts focusing on communicating the benefits and safety 227 of COVID - 19 vaccination for adolescents to the public could help increase adolescent COVID - 228 19 vaccine confidence and vaccination coverage . ” 64 229 As reports of allergic reactions to the mRNA COVID - 19 vaccines emerged early in the 230 pandemic , there is a common concern among allergic families , including families of adolescents 231 with asthma , about the risk of an allergic reaction to the COVID - 19 vaccine . 65 232 While the incidence of anaphylaxis post COVID - 19 vaccines is estimated at 233 approximately 7 . 91 cases per million doses , 66 which is higher than the historical incidence of 234 vaccine anaphylaxis overall ( of 1 . 3 cases per million doses ) , 67 this remains an exceptionally rare 235 outcome and thus far there has been no long - term morbidity nor mortality associated with 236 COVID - 19 vaccine anaphylaxis . While those who have reported allergic reactions to the 237 COVID - 19 vaccine commonly have self - reported prior allergic conditions , these conditions are 238 common in the general population , and the risk is impossible to quantify as the rate of 239 individuals with allergic conditions who have tolerated the COVID - 19 vaccine is not available . 66 240 In addition , as data emerges that revaccination of individuals with an immediate reaction to a 241 previous dose of COVID - 19 vaccine is safe , 68 – 71 and not influenced by testing to the vaccine or 242 its excipients , 72 , 73 there is increasing recognition these reactions are likely not allergen driven nor 243 IgE - mediated . The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ ( ACIP ) 244 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f recommends the use of the COVID - 19 vaccine ( Pfizer - BioNTech ) in adolescents 12 years and 245 older due to its efficacy against symptomatic COVID - 19 disease and to prevent community 246 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 74 including among adolescents with allergic conditions . The only 247 CDC indication for a vaccine exemption currently is a prior severe immediate reaction to a dose 248 of the COVID - 19 vaccine or its excipients . Adolescents with asthma and other allergic 249 conditions , in the absence of this history , would not qualify for a vaccine exemption . The Global 250 Initiative for Asthma ( GINA ) guideline recommends COVID - 19 vaccination among those with 251 asthma . 75 252 Another common concern is the use of asthma medications such as inhaled 253 corticosteroids ( ICS ) and biologics , and whether the vaccine can be given while on these 254 medications . Studies have shown the vaccine to be safe and well tolerated even if on asthma 255 biologic therapy or steroid ( whether oral or inhaled ) therapy , although less data is available for 256 the pediatric population . 63 , 76 It is recommended that the COVID - 19 vaccine and an asthma 257 biologic not be given the same day ( to differentiate the inciting agent should a reaction occur ) . 77 258 Current asthma medications ( with the exception of oral steroid dose of > 20 mg prednisone or 259 equivalent per day or more ) are not considered immunosuppressive and are not currently an 260 indication for a booster dose of the COVID - 19 vaccine . 78 , 79 261 Vaccine hesitancy has also been described more commonly among those facing other 262 adverse social determinants of health . In a survey study of 2000 participants evaluating 263 willingness to receive vaccination , attributes associated with a lower willingness to receive 264 vaccination included lack of insurance ( P < . 001 ) , lower educational attainment ( P < . 001 ) and 265 non - White race . 80 , 81 These adverse determinants are also associated both with asthma 266 morbidity , and COVID - 19 risk . 58 267 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 268 Asthma Management 269 Pharmacologic management has an essential role in optimizing asthma control for 270 school - aged children with asthma . The GINA strategy , as well as the AAAAI and multiple other 271 international guidelines , recommend remaining on prescribed asthma medications such as ICS 272 and biologics during the pandemic . 82 – 87 There is no evidence that these medications increase the 273 risk of COVID - 19 infection and paradoxically in some studies ICS therapy has been protective 274 against severe outcomes . 26 , 75 Nebulization should be avoided if possible as it is aerosol 275 generating . 42 , 88 Influenza vaccination is recommended . 26 276 Asthma management during the pandemic must consider a more scoping approach to 277 pediatric health . It is essential to optimize other health conditions that could have a longer - term 278 impact on asthma symptoms and outcomes ( and more broad pediatric outcomes ) during this time 279 – such as obesity . Studies have documented astounding increases in screen time , reductions in 280 physical activity , and increases in obesity rates among children during the pandemic . 89 – 91 Obesity 281 has emerged as a factor in children associated with poorer COVID - 19 outcomes . 92 In a cross - 282 sectional study of 43 , 465 children and adolescents , the strongest risk factors for COVID - 19 283 hospitalization included obesity ( aRR 3 . 07 ; 95 % CI : 2 . 66 - 3 . 54 ) . 93 With respect to asthma , obesity 284 increases the sensation of dyspnea , increases airway hyper - responsiveness , impairs immune 285 function , and potentially reduces response to ICS therapy . 94 , 95 More globally , obesity in 286 childhood increases the risk of a multitude of other health conditions over the course of a lifetime 287 including cardiovascular disease . 96 , 97 288 Asthma management , as with management of all pediatric conditions , must also factor in 289 the impact of adverse social determinants and health disparities . Multiple determinants of health , 290 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f including housing quality , poverty , healthcare access , health literacy , and race / ethnicity , all have 291 an impact on asthma ( and COVID - 19 ) outcomes . 51 , 98 – 101 At the individual clinician level , and 292 more broadly at the guideline and policy level , steps are required to ensure social determinants 293 are considered in the approach to a family with asthma both during , and after , the pandemic . 294 Broadly , the pandemic has also served as a call to resource stewardship and innovation 295 and allowed practitioners to consider how this may impact asthma care moving forward . 102 One 296 such example is step - up or step - down therapy . While remaining on current asthma medications is 297 generally recommended , little guidance exists on how to stratify risk during the pandemic , and 298 little guidance is specific to children or adolescents . For step - down therapy a stratification based 299 on atopic status , baseline risk , and seasonality has been proposed . 103 With the 2021 return to 300 school , some practitioners are recommending a brief step - up protocol to reduce the autumn risk 301 of asthma exacerbations . Home - based therapy such as home aeroallergen immunotherapy and 302 home omalizumab administration are novel approaches to ongoing provision of medical care 303 during the pandemic although both have limitations and are only recommended under very 304 specific circumstances . 104 , 105 305 Another example of innovative provision of care is the use of virtual care and telehealth 306 visits , which has emerged as an opportunity to improve access , reduce health disparities , and 307 prevent potential viral exposure in clinical settings during the pandemic . 102 A study of children 308 with asthma residing in two remote locations who were offered the choice of an in - person or 309 telemedicine session noted comparable asthma control between the two visit types , with high 310 family satisfaction among those who chose the telemedicine encounter . 106 School - based 311 telemedicine interventions have also been studied and are a novel approach to ongoing asthma 312 care especially among underserved families , including those living in remote locations . 107 , 108 A 313 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f school - based telemedicine approach would reduce school absence , reduce parental leave , and 314 allow the potential for application of digital health for monitoring exacerbations and adherence 315 to asthma medications . 107 , 108 316 317 Conclusion 318 There is no evidence that asthma increases the risk of severe COVID - 19 outcomes nor 319 that COVID - 19 causes severe asthma exacerbations among school - aged children . Asthma is not 320 an indication for a mask exemption , nor for a COVID - 19 vaccine exemption . It is also not 321 necessarily an indication for consideration of virtual learning . Asthma management consists of 322 remaining on current asthma medications , although step up or step down therapy could be 323 considered based on circumstances . More broadly , asthma management during the pandemic 324 must factor in other comorbidities that can worsen asthma control - such as obesity - as well as 325 more broadly the impact of adverse determinants of health . Finally , unprecedented times call for 326 unprecedented change , and this is being seen in the approach to home - based and virtual care . 327 328 References 329 1 .
