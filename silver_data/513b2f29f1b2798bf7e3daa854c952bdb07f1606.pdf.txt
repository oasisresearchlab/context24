It is exact for large d to order 1 / d , for any d to order ǫ = 4 − D and for d = D . For ﬂat physical membranes ( D = 2 , d = 3 ) it predicts a roughness exponent ζ = 0 . 590 . For phantom membranes at the crumpling transition the size exponent is ν = 0 . 732 . It yields identical lower critical dimension for the ﬂat phase and crumpling transition D lc ( d ) = 2 d d + 1 ( D lc = √ 2 for codimension 1 ) . For physical membranes with random quenched curvature ζ = 0 . 775 in the new T = 0 ﬂat phase in good agreement with simulations . PACS : 64 . 60Fr , 05 . 40 , 82 . 65Dp 1 There are now several experimental realizations of polymerized or solid - like membranes , such as protein networks of biological membranes 1 , 2 , polymerized lipid bilayers 3 and some inorganic surfaces 4 . Unlike linear polymers , two dimensional sheets of molecules with ﬁxed connectivity and non zero shear modulus are predicted to exhibit a ﬂat phase with broken orientational symmetry . Out of plane thermal undulations of solid membranes which induce a non - zero local Gaussian curvature are strongly suppressed because they are accompanied by in - plane shear deformations 5 . As a result , even ”phantom” tethered membranes should be ﬂat at low temperatures 5 , 6 , and exhibit a quite remarkable anomalous elasticity , with wavevector dependent elastic moduli that vanish and a bending rigidity that diverges at long wavelength 7 . Excluded volume interactions , present in physical membranes , further stabilize the ﬂat phase 8 but are usually assumed to be otherwise irrelevant to describe its long distance properties . Motivated by recent experiments on partially polymerized vesicles 3 , studies of models with quenched in - plane disorder have shown that the ﬂat phase is unstable at T = 0 to either local random stresses 9 or random spontaneous curvature 10 . Flat membranes of internal dimensionality D and linear size L are characterized by a rough - ness exponent ζ such that transverse displacements scale as L ζ . Nelson and Peliti ( NP ) , using a simple one loop self - consistent theory 5 for D = 2 which assumes non - vanishing elastic con - stants , found that phonon - mediated interactions between capillary waves lead to a renormalized bending rigidity κ R ( q ) ∼ q − η with η = 1 . Since ζ = ( 4 − D − η ) / 2 they predicted ζ = 1 / 2 for physical membranes . An ǫ = 4 − D expansion 7 conﬁrmed that the ﬂat phase was described by a non trivial ﬁxed point , but with anomalous elastic constants λ ( q ) ∼ µ ( q ) ∼ q η u , η u > 0 , with η u = 4 − D − 2 η as a consequence of rotational invariance . Thus , in general ζ = ( 4 − D + η u ) / 4 and the NP approximation corresponds to setting η u = 0 . There is presently some uncertainty on the precise value of the roughness exponent for physical membranes . Numerical simulations of tethered surfaces display a range of values for 2 ζ from 0 . 5 2 , 0 . 53 11 , 0 . 64 8 , 12 to 0 . 70 13 . On the other hand , the O ( ǫ ) result 7 suggests a value very close to the NP value 1 / 2 , ( 0 . 52 by naively setting ǫ = 2 ) . ζ should soon be measured from experiments , either directly from light scattering on diluted solutions 4 or indirectly , from the scale dependence of the elasticity 14 of lamellar stacks of solid membranes presently under experimental study . The buckling transition 6 , if observed , is controlled by a single exponent related to ζ . It thus seems desirable to explore further possible theoretical predictions for ζ . In this Letter we introduce a self - consistent approximation which improves on the Nelson Peliti theory 5 by allowing a non trivial renormalization of the elastic moduli . It is exact in three diﬀerent limits and compares well with numerical simulations . We construct two coupled self - consistent equations for the renormalized bending rigidity κ R ( q ) and elastic moduli µ R ( q ) , λ R ( q ) and solve them in the long wavelength limit . κ R ( q ) is determined by the propagator for the d c = d − D components h of the out of plane ﬂuctuations G ( q ) ∼ 1 / q 4 − D − η while the elastic moduli are determined by the four - point correlation function of h ﬁelds . Physically , our calculation includes the additional eﬀect of relaxation of in - plane stresses by out of plane displacements . As a result , curvature ﬂuctuations soften elastic constants and screen the phonon - mediated interaction . A similar Self - Consistent Screening Approximation ( SCSA ) was introduced by Bray 15 to estimate the η exponent of the critical O ( n ) model ( here d c plays the role of the number of components n ) and amounts to a partial resummation of the 1 / d c expansion . By construction , the method is exact for large codimension d c to ﬁrst order in 1 / d c and arbitrary D . Solving self - consistently then leads to an improved approximation of η ( d c , D ) ( and thus ζ ) for the small ( physical ) values of d c . The attractive feature of our theory is that it becomes exact in several other limits . Firstly , because of the Ward identities associated to rotational invariance we ﬁnd that η ( d c , D ) is exact to ﬁrst order in ǫ = 4 − D for arbitrary d c and is thus compatible with all presently known results 6 , 7 . Secondly , for d c = 0 it gives η = ( 4 − D ) / 2 which is the exact result since clearly 3 η u = 0 for d = D , and 7 η u = 4 − D − 2 η . This is at variance with the O ( n ) model for which the SCSA 15 is not exact for n = 0 . Thus we expect this method to give more accurate results for the present problem . Two - loop calculations are in progress 16 to estimate the deviation . An encouraging indication is the similarity of our method with the remarkably accurate self - consistent approximation of Kawasaki 17 for the critical dynamics of the binary ﬂuid mixture , which was shown to be exact to order ǫ , again because of Ward identities , and incorrect to order ǫ 2 by a tiny amount . We also apply this method to the crumpling transition of phantom membranes , and to ﬂat membranes with quenched disorder . Details can be found in Ref . 16 . In the ﬂat phase , the membrane in - plane and out - of plane displacements are parametrized respectively by a D - component phonon ﬁeld u α ( x ) , α = 1 , . . D , and a d c = d − D component out - of plane height ﬂuctuations ﬁeld h ( x ) . A monomer of internal coordinate x is at position r ( x ) = ( x α + u α ( x ) ) e α + h ( x ) where the e α are a set of D orthonormal vectors . The eﬀective free energy is the sum of a bending energy and an in plane elastic energy ( most relevant terms ) : F = Z d D x [ κ 2 ( ∇ 2 h ) 2 + µu 2 αβ + λ 2 u 2 αα ] ( 1 ) where the strain tensor is u αβ = 12 ( ∂ α u β + ∂ β u α + ∂ α h · ∂ β h ) To discuss the SCSA in the ﬂat phase it is convenient to ﬁrst integrate out the phonons 1 , 5 , and to work with the d c - component h ﬁeld . In terms of Fourier components the free energy takes the form of a critical theory : F eff = κ 2 Z dkk 4 | h ( k ) | 2 + 1 4 d c Z dk 1 dk 2 dk 3 R αβ , γδ ( q ) k 1 α k 2 β k 3 γ k 4 δ h ( k 1 ) . h ( k 2 ) h ( k 3 ) . h ( k 4 ) ( 2 ) with q = k 1 + k 2 and k 1 + k 2 + k 3 + k 4 = 0 and we use R dk to denote R d D k / ( 2 π ) D . The four - point coupling fourth - order tensor R ( q ) is transverse to q , the longitudinal part having been eliminated through phonon integration . It can be written as R ( q ) = bN ( q ) + µM ( q ) with : N αβ , γδ = 1 D − 1 P Tαβ P Tγδ , M αβ , γδ = 1 2 ( P Tαγ P Tβδ + P Tαδ P Tβγ ) − N αβ , γδ ( 3 ) where P Tαβ = δ αβ − q α q β / q 2 is the transverse projector . µ is the shear modulus and b = µ ( 2 µ + Dλ ) / ( 2 µ + λ ) is proportional to both shear and bulk moduli . The convenience of this 4 decomposition is that M and N are mutually orthogonal projectors under tensor multiplication ( e . g M αβ , γδ M γδ , µν = M αβ , µν etc . . . ) . We set up two coupled integral equations for the propagator of the h ﬁeld and for the renormalized four point interaction . We want to evaluate < h i ( − k ) h j ( k ) > = δ ij G ( k ) with G − 1 ( k ) = κ R ( k ) k 4 = κk 4 + σ ( k ) where σ ( k ) is the self energy . The SCSA is deﬁned in diagrammatic form by the graphs of Fig . 1a and 1b , where the double solid line denotes the dressed propagator G ( q ) , the dotted line the bare interaction R ( q ) and the wiggly line the ”screened” interaction ˜ R ( q ) dressed by the vacuum polarization bubbles . We thus obtain two equations , one for σ ( k ) which determines η , the other for R which determines η u : σ ( k ) = 2 d c k α k β k γ k δ Z dq ˜ R αβ , γδ ( q ) G ( k − q ) ( 4 a ) ˜ R ( q ) = R ( q ) − R ( q ) Π ( q ) ˜ R ( q ) ( 4 b ) where Π αβ , γδ ( q ) = R dpp α p β p γ p δ G ( p ) G ( q − p ) is the vacuum polarization and tensor multipli - cation is deﬁned above . Because of the transverse projectors , only the component Π ( q ) sym of Π ( q ) proportional to the fully symmetric tensor S αβ , γδ = δ αβ δ γδ + δ αγ δ βδ + δ αδ δ βγ contributes in ( 4b ) . Deﬁning Π ( q ) sym = I ( q ) S , simple algebra gives ˜ R ( q ) = ˜ µ ( q ) M + ˜ b ( q ) N with renormalized shear and shear - bulk moduli , and the new equations : ˜ µ ( q ) = µ 1 + 2 I ( q ) µ ˜ b ( q ) = b 1 + ( D + 1 ) I ( q ) b ( 5 a ) σ ( k ) = 2 d c Z dq ˜ b ( q ) + ( D − 2 ) ˜ µ ( q ) D − 1 ( kP T ( q ) k ) 2 G ( k − q ) ( 5 b ) We now solve these equations in the long - wavelength limit . Substituting G ( k ) ∼ σ − 1 ( k ) ∼ Z / k 4 − η in ( 5a , b ) , with Z a non - universal amplitude , we ﬁnd that the vacuum polarization integral diverges as : I ( q ) ∼ Z 2 A ( D , η ) q − η u ( 6 ) 5 where η u = 4 − D − 2 η is the anomalous exponent of phonons . Substituting in ( 5a , b ) , and deﬁning the amplitude : R dqq η u ( k − q ) − ( 4 − η ) ( kP T ( q ) k ) 2 = B ( D , η ) k 4 − η , one ﬁnds ( for µ , b > 0 ) that the Z and k 4 − η factors cancel and that η is determined self - consistently by the equation for the amplitude : d c = DD + 1 B ( D , η ) A ( D , η ) , which after calculation of the integrals deﬁning A , B gives : d c = 2 η D ( D − 1 ) Γ [ 1 + 12 η ] Γ [ 2 − η ] Γ [ η + D ] Γ [ 2 − 12 η ] Γ [ 12 D + 12 η ] Γ [ 2 − η − 12 D ] Γ [ η + 12 D ] Γ [ 12 D + 2 − 12 η ] ( 7 ) For D = 2 this equation can be simpliﬁed , and one ﬁnds ( Fig . 2 ) : η ( D = 2 , d c ) = 4 d c + q 16 − 2 d c + d 2 c ( 8 ) Thus for physical membranes we obtain : η = 0 . 821 , η u = 0 . 358 and : ζ = 1 − η 2 = √ 15 − 1 √ 15 + 1 = 0 . 590 . . ( 9 ) roughly at midvalue of the present numerical simulations . From ( 5 ) we also obtain Lim q → 0 ˜ λ ( q ) / ˜ µ ( q ) = − 2 D + 2 ( i . e a negative Poisson ratio ) . Expanding the result ( 7 ) in 1 / d c one obtains : η = 8 d c D − 1 D + 2 Γ [ D ] Γ [ D 2 ] 3 Γ [ 2 − D 2 ] + O ( 1 d 2 c ) = 2 d c + O ( 1 d 2 c ) ( forD = 2 ) ( 10 ) which coincides with the exact result 6 , 7 , as expected by construction of the SCSA . Similarly , expanding ( 7 ) to ﬁrst order in ǫ = 4 − D one ﬁnds : η = ǫ 2 + d c / 12 ( 11 ) also in agreement with the exact result 6 , 7 . This is not a general property of SCSA . Here it can be traced to the vertex and box diagrams of Fig . 1c being convergent . Indeed , because of the transverse projectors in ( 2 - 3 ) one can always extract one power of external momentum from each external h legs , which lowers the degree of divergence from naive power counting . As a result , if one decouples the 4 - point vertex R via a mediating ﬁeld , the only counterterms needed are for two - point functions . 6 We have analyzed the crumpling transition of phantom membranes by the same method , applied to the isotropic theory of Ref . 18 . The exponent η = η cr at the transition is determined by 16 : d = D ( D + 1 ) ( D − 4 + η ) ( D − 4 + 2 η ) ( 2 D − 3 + 2 η ) Γ [ 12 η ] Γ [ 2 − η ] Γ [ η + D ] Γ [ 2 − 12 η ] 2 ( 2 − η ) ( 5 − D − 2 η ) ( D + η − 1 ) Γ [ 12 D + 12 η ] Γ [ 2 − η − 12 D ] Γ [ η + 12 D ] Γ [ 12 D + 2 − 12 η ] ( 12 ) At the transition the radius of gyration scales as R G ∼ L ν with ν = ( 4 − D − η cr ) / 2 . For d = 3 and D = 2 we ﬁnd η cr = 0 . 535 and ν = 0 . 732 ( Haussdorf dimension d H = 2 . 73 ) . The embedding dimension d u ( D ) above which self - avoidance is irrelevant for the membrane at the crumpling transition is determined by the condition d u = 4 D / ( 4 − D − η cr ( d u ) ) . Using ( 12 ) we ﬁnd that d u ( 2 ) = 4 . 98 . The present method gives interesting predictions for lower critical dimensions . In the ﬂat phase , orientational order ( i . e in ∇ h ) disappears for D < D lc , where 2 − η ( D lc , d c ) = D lc . From ( 7 ) this is equivalent to d c = D lc ( D lc − 1 ) / ( 2 − D lc ) . On the other hand , the lower critical dimension D ′ lc ( d ) for the crumpling transition is deﬁned by 2 − η cr ( D ′ lc , d ) = D ′ lc , or equivalently from ( 12 ) , d = D ′ lc / ( 2 − D ′ lc ) . Since d = D / ( 2 − D ) is clearly equivalent to d c = D ( D − 1 ) / ( 2 − D ) we ﬁnd that the lower critical dimensions of the crumpling transition and of the ﬂat phase , as predicted by SCSA , are identical , and given by D lc ( d ) = 2 d / ( 1 + d ) . Since they originate from very diﬀerent calculations , this indicates that the SCSA is quite consistent . For codimension 1 manifolds D lc = √ 2 and for ﬁxed embedding space d = 3 , D lc = 3 / 2 . D lc increases from D lc = 1 for d c = 0 , to D lc = 2 when d c → ∞ as expected . Note that for d > 3 self - avoidance cannot modify the above results , while for d < 3 it is an open question . We can compare ( 8 , 12 ) with recent simulations 19 of D = 2 membranes with self - avoidance in higher d c . The membranes are found ﬂat in d = 3 , 4 with ζ ( d = 3 ) = 0 . 64 ± 0 . 04 , ζ ( d = 4 ) = 0 . 77 ± 0 . 04 , whereas we obtain 0 . 59 , 0 . 67 , respectively . The membrane is crumpled in d = 5 7 with ν = 0 . 8 ± 0 . 06 , although d = 5 seems almost marginal , whereas we ﬁnd ν = 0 . 8 at the crumpling transition where self avoidance is irrelevant , although almost marginally so . Flat membranes with random spontaneous curvature are described by adding the term − R d D x c ( x ) . ∇ 2 h ( x ) in the energy ( 1 ) , where c ( x ) are Gaussian quenched random variables 10 . Within a replica symmetric SCSA , we ﬁnd a marginally unstable T = 0 ﬁxed point , i . e a long - wavelength solution only if T → 0 ﬁrst . Deﬁning the replica connected and oﬀ - diagonal exponents η , η ′ , by < h ( − q ) h ( q ) > c ∼ q − ( 4 − η ) , < h ( − q ) h ( q ) > ∼ q − ( 4 − η ′ ) we ﬁnd 16 at this ﬁxed point : η ′ = η , η ( d c , D ) = η pure ( 4 d c , D ) . Thus one can simply replace d c in the pure result by 4 d c ! Again this agrees with the 1 / d c and ǫ expansions 10 . For physical membranes D = 2 , d c = 1 , we ﬁnd from ( 8 ) : η = 2 / ( 2 + √ 6 ) = 0 . 449 ζ = 0 . 775 comparing well with the numerical simulation 10 result ζ = 0 . 81 ± 0 . 03 . By analogy with the random ﬁeld problem 20 , it is quite possible that the equality η = η ′ , conjectured in Ref . 10 to all orders , be corrected when replica - symmetry breaking is included . In conclusion , we have presented a self - consistent theory of polymerized membranes which becomes exact in three limits ( large d c , small ǫ = 4 − D , and d c = 0 ) . By construction , it satisﬁes the exponent relations η u = 4 − D − 2 η and 16 1 / ν ′ = D − 2 + η . These relations are exact in the true theory because of rotational invariance 6 , 7 . It thus predicts ν ′ = 1 . 218 and δ ′ = 1 . 436 for the buckling transition exponents 6 . It contradicts the conjecture 2 ζ = 1 / 2 . We thank D . Nelson , M . Mezard for discussions .
