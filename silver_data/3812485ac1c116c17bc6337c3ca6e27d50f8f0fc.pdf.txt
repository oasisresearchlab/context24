BMC Public Health Superspreading , overdispersion and their implications in the SARS - CoV - 2 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic : a systematic review and meta - analysis of the literature Oliver Wegehaupt 1 , 2 , 3 * , Akira Endo 4 , 5 , 6 and Anna Vassall 3 , 7 Abstract Background A recurrent feature of infectious diseases is the observation that different individuals show different levels of secondary transmission . This inter - individual variation in transmission potential is often quantified by the dis - persion parameter k . Low values of k indicate a high degree of variability and a greater probability of superspreading events . Understanding k for COVID - 19 across contexts can assist policy makers prepare for future pandemics . Methods A literature search following a systematic approach was carried out in PubMed , Embase , Web of Science , Cochrane Library , medRxiv , bioRxiv and arXiv to identify publications containing epidemiological findings on super - spreading in COVID - 19 . Study characteristics , epidemiological data , including estimates for k and R0 , and public health recommendations were extracted from relevant records . Results The literature search yielded 28 peer - reviewed studies . The mean k estimates ranged from 0 . 04 to 2 . 97 . Among the 28 studies , 93 % reported mean k estimates lower than one , which is considered as marked heterogene - ity in inter - individual transmission potential . Recommended control measures were specifically aimed at preventing superspreading events . The combination of forward and backward contact tracing , timely confirmation of cases , rapid case isolation , vaccination and preventive measures were suggested as important components to suppress superspreading . Conclusions Superspreading events were a major feature in the pandemic of SARS - CoV - 2 . On the one hand , this made outbreaks potentially more explosive but on the other hand also more responsive to public health interven - tions . Going forward , understanding k is critical for tailoring public health measures to high - risk groups and settings where superspreading events occur .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1003 Background Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 in late 2019 and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO on 30 th January 2020 [ 1 ] , more than 670 million cases have been recorded as of February 2023 [ 2 ] . Numerous efforts have been made to mitigate onward transmission . Knowledge about dispersion characteristics are indispensable for public health policy as it allows tailored control meas - ures , and understanding dispersion may be critical for future pandemics . The dispersion parameter k is an estimate of the disper - sion in the number of secondary transmissions generated by each case . It is critical to estimating the probability of superspreading events in which certain individuals infect unusually large numbers of secondary cases [ 3 ] . Lloyd - Smith et al . first described that the distribution of individual transmission potential around the basic repro - duction number R0 is frequently right skewed or overdis - persed [ 3 , 4 ] . They introduced the dispersion parameter k that indicates the variance in the number of offspring based on a Negative Binomial distribution [ 3 ] . Hence , k can be described as the variation in inter - individual transmission potential whereby low values of k represent higher variation and larger probability of superspreading events . The ‘20 / 80 rule’ is a rule of thumb that emphasises the level of variance typically observed in infectious disease transmission : it is not uncommon that only about 20 % of primary cases cause 80 % of onward transmission [ 5 ] . In sexually transmitted and vector - borne diseases , studies often indicate the percentage of most infectious primary cases that account for 80 % of secondary cases , serving as a surrogate marker for heterogeneity in individual infec - tiousness [ 5 ] . If a disease spreads homogeneously , the variance around the base reproduction number R0 is low , k approaches infinity and the distribution of secondary cases approaches Poisson ( Fig . 1A ) . Each case transmits the pathogen onto the next generation rather equally . In this scenario , broad population - wide control meas - ures are necessary and the disease is more difficult to contain [ 3 ] . Contrarily , a heterogeneous offspring dis - tribution exhibits a wider dispersion around R0 and k is smaller than one . In this scenario , superspreading events are more likely to occur and become a major concern ( Fig . 1B ) . Large outbreaks happen less frequently but can become more explosive [ 3 ] . In this case , by focusing on specific settings or high - risk groups where superspread - ing occurs , for example large gatherings indoors or peo - ple of a certain age group , better containment of virus spread could be achieved without imposing population - wide control measures . Simultaneously , the probability of extinction of the disease is more likely as more cases have no offspring at all . Where the majority of cases does not contribute to onward transmission , the effective reproduction num - ber could be substantially reduced by preventing super - spreading events [ 6 , 7 ] . In other words , public health interventions that specifically target settings where superspreading events occur could rapidly reduce over - all transmission [ 8 ] . With high levels of superspreading , individual specific control measures targeting risk groups are likely to outperform population - wide interventions [ 9 ] . Infectious diseases with high levels of heterogeneity in transmission , in principle , should be easy to control with public health interventions [ 10 ] and this hetero - geneity can even be advantageous for control measures [ 11 ] . However , this all depends on the ability to effec - tively identify and reduce transmission related behavior in those populations spreading the disease , without stig - matising those groups , and considering societal equity . Moreover , the effectiveness of measures will also criti - cally depend on R0 and the speed to which any interven - tion can be implemented . This study reviews the dispersion parameter k in the context of the SARS - CoV - 2 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic , taking into account all - group k estimates as well as val - ues for different subgroups . Following on from this , rec - ommendations for public health are assembled , which studies derived from the calculation of their dispersion parameter estimates . Our aim is to provide a summary that researchers and policy makers can use to better understand the characteristics of k and in doing so can inform future pandemics . Methods Search strategy and study selection process A review of the literature was undertaken using a system - atic approach . On 4 th August 2022 an online search was carried out for publications from 1 st January 2020 to 4 th August 2022 including the databases PubMed ( via NCBI ) ; EMBASE ( via OVID ) ; Web of Science ; Cochrane Library . As a considerable proportion of work on SARS - CoV - 2 / COVID - 19 has been published as preprint articles , the “COVID - 19 Portfolio” server of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) [ 12 ] was additionally searched for non - peer reviewed work filtering for the following databases : MedRxiv ; BioRxiv ; arXiv . Three search components were set up for the lit - erature review with the following key concepts : ( A ) “SARS - CoV - 2” , ( B ) “superspreading” and ( C ) “disper - sion” . Keywords were searched for in all databases ( see Table 1 ) . Subject heading searches were conducted in databases where available ( in principle PubMed , Embase , Page 3 of 22 Wegehaupt et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1003 Cochrane Library ) and where appropriate MeSH terms were identified . For further eligibility of literature the following inclu - sion criteria had to be met : The study was published on a peer - reviewed or non - peer - reviewed server ; the study was based on real world data ( e . g . epidemiological sur - veillance , contact tracing data , genetic analysis of patient samples ) ; the study provided at least one all - group esti - mate for dispersion parameter k ; the study was published between 1 st January 2020 and 4 th August 2022 in English or German language . Modelling studies were included when they drew on or were validated on epidemiological data . This study both updated and extended a previously published review [ 13 ] in terms of study period covered and data extracted . In doing so , we aimed to expand the understanding of k in SARS - CoV - 2 in the rapidly evolv - ing pandemic by including most recent studies , captur - ing evidence on virus subtypes , but also obtaining k estimates in various subgroups . In addition , we compiled public health recommendations derived from calculated k estimates . The systematic literature search identified a total of 675 studies ( 307 on databases for peer - reviewed and 368 on databases for pre - print articles ) from 1 st Janu - ary 2020 to 4 th August 2022 . The Cochrane database Fig . 1 Conceptual framework . Homogeneous and heterogeneous patterns of disease transmission require different control measures . A : Every infected individual passes on the disease to two other people on average , R0 equals two , k approaches infinity , secondary cases show a Poisson distribution with mean and variance equal to R0 . As a consequence , Public Health aims at population - wide control measures . B : Infected individuals show different levels of secondary transmission , R0 equals two as in scenario A , but contrastingly k is smaller than one . Secondary cases show a Negative Binomial distribution . Public health measures can target high risk groups or settings where superspreading is likely to occur .

A reference list search of the previous review [ 13 ] yielded an additional four studies that met inclusion criteria . 679 records were imported into EndNote software ( Version X9 3 . 3 ) . After removal of 201 duplicates by stepwise deduplica - tion , the remaining 478 records were screened by title and abstract . 434 studies did not meet inclusion crite - ria ( 18 not related to SARS - CoV - 2 ; 125 other SARS - CoV - 2 related public health topics ; 201 insufficient information on dispersion parameters ; 69 other natural sciences topic ; 18 single case reports ; 1 non English / German language ; 2 communications ) and 44 stud - ies were assessed further for eligibility . Among these , another 16 studies were excluded due to insufficient information on dispersion parameter estimates or pure focus on outbreak simulation . A total of 28 records was finally included in this study : We re - examined and extended data extraction of the 17 studies that were also included in the previous review [ 13 ] . Additionally , one major study of 2020 [ 14 ] not captured by the previ - ous review was included as well as 10 newly identified and recently published studies ( after 10 / 09 / 2021 ) for complete data extraction . Quality appraisal , data extraction and synthesis Quality appraisal of literature was of particular con - cern in this study as a significant number of non - peer reviewed , and therefore possibly not previously quality checked , COVID - 19 work was expected to be eligible for inclusion according to the search strategy . The final set of identified studies was subjected to a critical qual - ity appraisal checklist according to the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme ( CASP ) guidelines [ 15 ] and the quality of cross - sectional studies ( AXIS ) scale [ 16 ] . A set of 13 quality appraisal questions were grouped into the catego - ries “introduction” ( 2 questions ) , “methods” ( 6 ) , “results” ( 2 ) and “discussion” ( 3 ) . The articles were scored based on positive units , ranging from strong ( ≥ 10 / 13 “YES” - units ) and good ( 7 - 10 / 13 ) to weak ( < 7 / 13 ) quality ( see supplement A ) . Emphasis was given to the assessment of the description of methods in order to ensure an a priori valid dispersion parameter calculation . Articles finally included in this review were first clas - sified by their study characteristics : Author , journal , publication date , title , type of method for estimation of k and type of dataset . Subsequently , epidemiological data was extracted : Estimate of dispersion parameter k ; 95 % Table 1 Search strategy Steps Search terms Search component A ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) 1 Keywords SARS - CoV2 OR SARS - CoV - 2 OR Covid19 OR Covid - 19 OR " Coronavirus 2019 " OR " 2019 - nCoV " OR " Wuhan coronavirus " OR " Wuhan pneumonia " 2 Subject headings PubMed : SARS - CoV - 2 , COVID - 19 Embase : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 , coronavirus disease 2019 3 1 OR 2 ( results for search component A ) Search component B ( Superspreading ) 4 Keywords Superspread * OR super - spread * 5 Subject headings Embase : superspreading event 6 4 OR 5 ( results for search component B ) Search component C ( Dispersion ) 7 Keywords Dispersion OR kappa OR variability OR heterogen * OR " secondary case * " OR " 20 / 80 rule " 8 Subject headings Embase : Epidemiological data 9 7 AND 8 ( results for search component C ) Inclusion for further assessment 10 3 AND 6 AND 9 ( Embase ) 11 3 AND 4 AND 7 ( PubMed ) 12 1 and 4 and 7 ( Web of Science , Cochrane Library , medRxiv , arXiv , bioRxiv ) Page 5 of 22 Wegehaupt et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1003 confidence interval ( CI ) of dispersion parameter k ; esti - mate of basic reproduction number R0 ; 95 % CI of basic reproduction number R0 ; percentage of cases that is responsible for 80 % of secondary cases ( 20 / 80 rule ) ; pop - ulation ( size , contacts , clusters ) ; information on analysis of subgroups / clusters / settings / events ; study period ; and region / country . Moreover , public health control measures that were recommended based on the identi - fied dispersion characteristics were extracted as well as the type of virus investigated ( wildtype vs . variant of con - cern ( VOC ) ) ( see supplement B ) . To investigate whether the dispersion of secondary cases differs in certain sub - groups , available data on k estimates in subgroups was grouped into four categories for further analysis : ( 1 ) set - tings , ( 2 ) age of primary case , ( 3 ) symptoms at the time of disease transmission , and ( 4 ) pre / after public health intervention . Data extracted in this study was primarily used for descriptive and comparative analysis . Epidemiological calculations and meta - analysis For studies that included an all - group mean k estimate , its 95 % confidence interval and the number of cases studied ( sample size ) , a meta - analysis was carried out to approximate a pooled global k value for SARS - CoV - 2 . The analysis included 32 values ( obtained from 24 stud - ies ) . Four studies ( containing 8 all - group mean k esti - mates ) were excluded for the pooled analysis because of lack of sample size [ 6 , 17 ] , confidence intervals [ 10 ] , or both [ 18 ] . Two all - group mean k estimates in one study [ 19 ] were excluded as upper confidence intervals reached infinity and thus weight in the pooled estimate was con - sidered negligible . The calculation of a global mean k esti - mate was performed using the inverse variance method for pooling . Hereby , studies containing larger sample sizes and small confidence intervals were given more weight . Obtaining high heterogeneity between values ( I 2 test for heterogeneity = 100 % ) , we subsequently employed a random effects model for the measurement of a global mean k estimate . Calculations were carried out in R ( ver - sion 4 . 2 . 3 ) , R - package ‘meta’ . Results Study characteristics The PRISMA flowchart shows the detailed study selec - tion process ( Fig . 2 ) . Table 2 summarises the study char - acteristics of included studies , by author in alphabetical order . Type of articles , date of publication and critical appraisal All 28 studies finally included were peer - reviewed publications . Any pre - print article that was identi - fied within the study selection process was removed by deduplication as it had meanwhile been published in a peer - reviewed journal . Included studies were published between 2020 and 2022 , with the first publication on SARS - CoV - 2 superspreading dating to 30 th January 2020 [ 17 ] and the most recent dating to 11 th July 2022 [ 22 ] . The quality assessment by critical appraisal revealed high - quality studies ( all scoring 10 or higher , see supplement C ) . The most frequent weakness was the lack of consid - ering limitations in nine publications . The fact that any eligible pre - print article had been published in a peer - reviewed journal in the meantime supported the results of the quality appraisal of included studies . Type of dataset The included studies performed their calculations using epidemiological data . Five categories of datasets could be identified : the first type of dataset was used by 7 studies and was based on contact tracing data . By asking patients with confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection to document their close contacts with other infected patients , cases could be placed in a wider transmission network . Calculating the empirical offspring distribution led to an estimate of transmission heterogeneity . A second basis for estimat - ing the dispersion in the population under study was sur - veillance data . Four studies exclusively used information from surveillance to infer transmission dynamics . In this kind of analysis , temporal and geographical coincidence of one or more index and secondary cases is used as a means to indirectly reconstruct clusters of cases . 13 stud - ies used a combination of surveillance and contact trac - ing data ( see Table 2 ) . We did not observe any significant difference between all - group mean k estimates originat - ing from contact tracing data , surveillance data or a com - bination of both ( see supplement D ) . Thirdly , two studies drew on SARS - CoV - 2 genomic sequences and used phy - logenetic trees to deduce dispersion patterns [ 30 , 36 ] . RNA viruses constantly mutate during replication and transmission . By sequencing the viral genome , epidemi - ological information can thus be obtained and mapped into transmission networks . As a fourth data source , a study investigating the variability of within household transmission , paired serological SARS - CoV - 2 antibody test data with a household survey [ 10 ] . The fifth type of dataset matched surveillance data ( including demo - graphic information and geolocation of the residence of cases ) with aggregate high - volume mobility data of the population ( obtained by Facebook users who enabled location services on their mobile phones ) to infer viral spreading across the region [ 18 ] . Type of method for estimation of k In line with a common mode of measuring the hetero - geneity of infectiousness and suggested by the pivotal paper of superspreading events in infectious diseases Page 6 of 22 Wegehaupt et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1003 [ 3 ] , most studies used a negative binomial distribu - tion for the estimation of the dispersion parameter k [ 6 – 8 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 17 – 24 , 26 – 29 , 31 – 35 , 37 , 38 ] . In addi - tion , one study quantified superspreading potential by using different mixture distributions and compared these to the negative binomial dispersion parameter : the authors suggest a cautious choice of the underlying data generating distribution as the mean in offspring and its variance can become skewed with increas - ing overdispersion if incorrect assumptions about the type of distribution are made [ 28 ] . Finally , two studies analysed genomic SARS - CoV - 2 sequences obtained by patients’ samples and subsequently used these for phy - lodynamic analyses for the estimation of k [ 30 , 36 ] .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1003 Countries Studies investigated SARS - CoV - 2 superspreading in 12 countries : China [ 9 , 24 , 36 ] ( including specific reports on Hong Kong [ 9 , 11 , 19 , 21 , 28 ] , Shenzhen [ 20 ] , Tian - jin [ 9 , 37 ] , Wanzhou [ 32 ] and the provinces of Hunan [ 33 ] , Guangdong [ 38 ] and Shandong [ 35 ] ) , Denmark [ 6 ] , France [ 8 ] , India ( regions of Karnataka [ 22 ] , Tamil Nadu and Anda Pradesh [ 14 , 28 ] ) , Israel [ 30 ] , Indonesia [ 23 ] ( Jakarta Depok , region of Batam ) , Japan [ 19 , 27 ] , New Zealand [ 26 ] , Rwanda [ 28 ] , Singapore [ 19 , 34 ] , South Korea [ 29 , 31 ] , and the United States of America ( states of Georgia [ 18 ] and Utah [ 10 ] ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Two studies exam - ined patterns of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission from a global perspective [ 7 , 17 ] . Epidemiological parameters Estimates for dispersion parameter k All studies provided a point estimate and 95 % CI for the dispersion parameter k , indicating the extent of hetero - geneity in disease transmission . 93 % of studies ( 26 of 28 ) reported mean k estimates lower than one and found a high degree of superspreading potential . Mean k esti - mates ranged from 0 . 04 ( 0 . 03 , 0 . 04 ) [ 22 ] to 2 . 97 ( 2 . 86 , 3 . 08 ) [ 30 ] . The median of reported mean k point esti - mates was 0 . 31 . In total , 42 all - group point estimates of k were reported across 28 studies . Employing a weighted meta - analysis of 32 point estimates ( of 24 studies ) , the global pooled mean estimate of k was 0 . 41 ( 0 . 23 , 0 . 60 ) . Figure 4A illustrates the all - group mean k estimates for all studies and the global pooled mean estimate . Table 3 shows all epidemiological data extracted from 28 publi - cations . Paired estimates of R0 and k for each study are displayed in Fig . 5 . Proportion of primary cases accounting for 80 % of onward transmission Sixteen studies presented the fraction of most infectious that generate 80 % of secondary cases in SARS - CoV - 2 , ranging from 8 . 7 % to 32 . 3 % ( Fig . 4B ) . Nine studies found that percentages of less than 20 % of cases accounted for 80 % of onward transmission . Subgroup analysis Analysis by cluster type and setting Five studies inves - tigated the dispersion of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in specific settings . High levels of overdispersion were present across all settings with mean k estimates rang - ing between 0 . 014 and 0 . 72 ( Fig . 6A by setting , Fig . 6B by publication ) . Three studies identified k estimates in households and four at work with superspreading occur - ring somewhat less likely in the former than in the latter . Both religious gatherings and hospitals or convalescent homes were identified as risk settings for superspreading [ 22 , 29 , 35 ] . There was an increase in overdispersion and superspreading potential the less close the contacts were Fig . 3 Geographical mapping of reported k estimates . Shown are all - group point estimates of k . Colour - coding based on the countries’ values in the range of k . Created with mapchart . net Page 10 of 22 Wegehaupt et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1003 [ 33 ] ( risk in ascending order : household , extended fam - ily , social contact and community contact ) . This result of high overdispersion following sporadic community con - tacts was consistent with low k values found for leisure facilities [ 29 ] and air transportation [ 35 ] in two other studies . Analysis by age of infector A Japanese study found low k estimates for all age groups throughout the entire study period which did not differ significantly . Of note , 80 % of primary cases causing secondary transmission belonged to the age group of 20 - 69 years [ 27 ] . The other study stratifying k for age groups reported that children under 10 years played less of a role in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 than adults . With a mean reproduction number of 0 . 87 ( versus 1 . 49 and 1 . 51 for adults and elderly people , respectively ) and a mean k estimate of 3 . 17 ( versus 0 . 7 and 0 . 5 for adults and elderly people , respectively ) , they generated fewer secondary cases on average and were less likely to be superspreaders [ 26 ] ( Fig . 6C ) . Another study divided into two age groups above and below 60 years of Fig . 4 All - group point estimates of k and proportion of primary cases accounting for 80 % of onward transmission .

Though not directly calculating k values , it showed that the average of the mean number of offspring in the age group under 60 years is 2 . 78 ( 2 . 10 , 4 . 22 ) times larger than in elderly cases and that younger people therefore tended to generate more extreme numbers of offspring [ 18 ] . Analysis by symptoms Two studies distinguished between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases . The basic reproduction number was significantly lower in asympto - matic than in symptomatic cases , but overdispersion was higher in the asymptomatic group [ 22 ] . Except for the first of transmission generations , a lower R0 in asympto - matic cases was also observed in the other study , which , however , did not determine k values [ 32 ] ( Fig . 6D ) . Analysis by public health intervention Two studies examined whether heterogeneity in individual infec - tiousness is affected by pandemic control measures . In the first study , after interventions ( traffic restriction , quarantine measures ) had taken effect , a lower trans - mission potential and heterogeneity ( decrease in R0 and increase in k ) was observed [ 37 ] . The second study also found a decrease in R0 after alert level introduction ( cur - fews , shutdown of business and schools ) , but contrarily showed an associated decrease in k across all age groups [ 26 ] , but if this decrease in k under public health inter - ventions resulted in more superspreading events was not discussed ( Fig . 6E ) . Virus characteristics Three studies focused on the SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern Delta and Omicron , respectively . Delta is attrib - uted a higher superspreading potential ( k = 0 . 26 ) by the first publication , compared to that of the wild - type in the early pandemic outbreaks [ 38 ] . The authors empha - sised the risk of superspreading if Delta entered areas with low herd immunity or places where many people meet . The second study analysed the change in transmis - sion dynamics as Delta became the dominant variant in South Korea . A slight increase in k was identified here ( 0 . 64 and 0 . 85 before and at predominance , respectively ) [ 31 ] . One study looked at heterogeneity in transmission of the Omicron variant and found overdispersed trans - mission . Compared to Omicron subtype BA . 1 , the more recent subtype BA . 2 has an even greater superspreading potential [ 21 ] . The authors hypothesise that the observa - tion of greater susceptibility to superspreading might be explained with low prevalence of vaccination boosters at Fig . 5 R0 and corresponding k values . Shown are extracted R0 and corresponding k values ( with 95 % CI ) . Upper CI limit not depicted if reaching infinity . Page 18 of 22 Wegehaupt et al .

Public Health recommendations Table 4 categorises and lists all public health interven - tions recommended in the reviewed papers , as stated in the publications , regardless of their feasibility , societal or legal / human rights implications . The strategy to spe - cifically ban large gatherings and limit capacity in indoor spaces was the most recommended , followed by target - ing high - risk groups and large close contact groups . In the category of surveillance and contact tracing , the need for rapid tracing and quarantine for contacts was most frequently suggested . One study that calculated a mean k point estimate also addressed backward tracing as an approach to mitigate viral spread . Population - wide con - trol measures like wearing face - masks and vaccination were also among the recommendations to reduce viral spread despite an overdispersed transmission pattern . Discussion We find here a wide range of work that estimates the heterogeneity in transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and over - all , we find consistent evidence of high level of overdis - persion across settings . This suggests that public health measures that focus on risk groups may have been effec - tive at slowing transmission , where the disease had not been evenly spreading among the general population . Heterogeneity in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was pre - sent in the early outbreaks of the pandemic as well as in the latest observations and across different variants . Our compilation of k estimates for subgroups classified according to different criteria showed that superspread - ing occurs across all age groups and in a wide variety of settings . Children may seem to be less heterogeneous transmitters though the number of studies stratifying for age was limited . By contrast , asymptomatic carriers can be particularly hazardous , as they showed more hetero - geneous transmission patterns and can thus also contrib - ute to superspreading . Going forward , a common approach in early pandemic response measures is the so - called backward tracing of cases , recommended by one study [ 22 ] , in which not only possible contacts of the infected individual are noti - fied , but also the origin of infection is traced back to the index case . This method helps to identify clusters and was largely adopted by Japan in the first wave of infec - tions [ 27 , 39 ] . Cluster based approaches were shown to be effective in preventing superspreading events and help to terminate transmission chains , where done very promptly [ 27 ] . In the case of COVID - 19 , we found one modelling study comparing backward and forward trac - ing methods . It suggested that primary cases identi - fied by backward tracing may generate 3 - 10 times more infections than those identified by forward tracing [ 40 ] . The proportion of secondary cases thereby averted was estimated to two to threefold and effectively contributed to outbreak control . These findings are a reminder , that early rapid control efforts can be pivotal even in patho - gens with high levels of infectiousness .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1003 Nevertheless , SARS - CoV - 2 transmission highlighted the challenge for non - pharmaceutical interventions to specifically target risk groups and settings [ 11 , 30 , 37 ] . As demonstrated in the subgroup analysis , superspread - ing events occurred in a large variety of settings . In ret - rospect , heterogeneity of infectiousness was equally present within households and at work . Nevertheless , special attention should probably be paid in pandemic response planning to known indoor and special risk set - tings ( e . g . care facilities , prisons , food processing plants , cruise ships , and large gatherings [ 41 ] ) , as proposed by most of the reviewed studies . The general observation of overdispersion in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission seems to be very robust . Estimates for k were reported across different countries , time points , populations and different viral strains . Moreover , different datasets and methods have been applied for cal - culations . Together with the presence of study cohorts with large sample sizes , reported estimates of k seemed consistent and plausible overall . However , the dispersion parameter from one region cannot necessarily be trans - ferred to another as populations differ in general com - position , immunity level and control measures in place . Interestingly though , the age distribution of a popula - tion on a nationwide scale was not likely to be associated with SARS - CoV - 2 superspreading potential . In 2020 , the median age of reviewed countries ranged from 20 . 3 years ( Rwanda ) to 48 . 2 ( Japan ) years [ 42 ] . The respective k esti - mates did not correlate with median age across countries . This study has several limitations . Firstly , the scope of our review did not include direct assessment of the quality of statistical measurements of reviewed publi - cations or the quality of the source datasets . It was also beyond the scope of this work to reconstruct quantities of interest ( e . g . for k , R0 or the 20 / 80 rule ) that were not reported in the reviewed studies . These mean that we assumed that all the reported estimates were statisti - cally sound and accurate . Secondly , reported estimates are from datasets collected in various time points in the pandemic under different levels of interventions and / or behavioural changes , which could have deviated the estimates from the “baseline” SARS - CoV - 2 dispersion patterns . Moreover , with a growing number of vacci - nated individuals from the end of 2020 onward , the virus no longer encounters a fully susceptible population . For these reasons , k estimates would only reflect real - world conditions at the time of investigation . Thirdly , under lockdowns , superspreading events were by default only possible where people were still allowed to meet ( e . g . in households or at work ) . Data on superspreading events in settings that were under restriction ( e . g . concert halls , theatres ) has been limited . Fourth , being conducted in the middle of a pandemic , the included studies were mostly retrospective and secondary by nature . As the data was primarily collected for other purposes than estimating k ( e . g . case isolation ) , possible estimation approaches were restricted by available data types . Esti - mates of k may have been more likely to be reported from settings where the collected data was incidentally suitable for estimation , which could be a source of bias . Estimat - ing k is most straightforward when the distribution of the number of secondary transmissions per case is available , e . g . through contact tracing . In such instances , k can be estimated simply by fitting a negative binomial distribu - tion to the observed data . Most of the studies included in our review used this approach and the pooled esti - mate may have been subject to limitations associated with the data collection , e . g . unidentified epidemiological links . Although some modelling approaches could esti - mate k from other ( less informative ) types of data , e . g . cluster sizes [ 7 , 43 ] , they seem to have been rarely used for COVID - 19 data , potentially due to data access and technical hurdles . Finally , most studies were conducted before the emergence of variants of concern ( VOC ) ; only few studies estimated parameters for VOCs including Delta and Omicron . These variants might have different epidemiological characteristics than wild type SARS - CoV - 2 . Two of the included studies analysed data con - taining the Delta variant and only one study covered the Omicron variant , which left the evidence for these vari - ants unestablished . Taken together , our findings highlight the importance to consider the two key metrics of transmission poten - tial - R0 and k – in parallel in preparing for control meas - ures and to weigh these against each other . There is no “one - fits - all” approach , but in general early indications of overdispersed offspring distribution warrants imple - mentation of targeted measures to mitigate pandemic spread and especially control superspreading events . Approaches for real - time monitoring of transmission heterogeneity and simultaneous estimation of R0 and k from incidence data are currently being explored [ 44 ] and should be fully incorporated in surveillance systems . Conclusion In summary , the systematic literature review for super - spreading events in the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic with epidemiological characterisation of transmission pat - terns yielded dispersion parameter estimates that were mostly smaller than one , indicating a high superspread - ing potential . A combination of forward and backward contact tracing , timely confirmation of cases , rapid case isolation , vaccination , and preventive measures were suggested to be important measures for outbreak con - trol and the suppression of superspreading events . Fur - ther investigations have to be performed to analyse new Page 21 of 22 Wegehaupt et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1003 SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern , in particular Omicron subvariants , as data for heterogeneity in transmission is still limited here . Future research will also need to eluci - date heterogeneity in transmission in African and Latin American countries for a global picture of dispersion patterns . It should be determined how k is affected in populations of partially vaccinated or recovered people , in particular in remaining susceptibles . Since parts of the population cannot be vaccinated , public health measures will then also have to prevent superspreading in these vulnerable groups .
