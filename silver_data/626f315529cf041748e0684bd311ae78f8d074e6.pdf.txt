Cyclin degradation is central to regulation of the cell cycle . Mitotic exit was proposed to require degradation of the S phase cyclin Clb5 by the anaphase - promoting complex 1 , 2 activated by Cdc20 ( APC Cdc20 ) 3 . Furthermore , Clb5 degradation was thought to be necessary for effective dephosphorylation and activation of the APC regulatory subunit Cdh1 ( also known as Hct1 ) and the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 by the phosphatase Cdc14 , allowing mitotic kinase inactivation and mitotic exit 3 – 7 . Here we show , however , that spindle disassembly and cell div - ision occur without signiﬁcant APC Cdc20 - mediated Clb5 degra - dation , as well as in the absence of both Cdh1 and Sic1 . We ﬁnd instead that destruction - box - dependent degradation of the mito - tic cyclin Clb2 is essential for mitotic exit . APC Cdc20 may be required for an essential early phase of Clb2 degradation , and this phase may be sufﬁcient for most aspects of mitotic exit . Cdh1 and Sic1 may be required for further inactivation of Clb2 – Cdk1 , regulating cell size and the length of G1 . CDC20 is essential for mitosis . Cdc20 - dependent degradation of the securin Pds1 is required for chromosome separation . pds1 deletion ( pds1 D ) allows chromosome separation but not mitotic exit in cdc20 D cells 8 , suggesting that additional APC Cdc20 targets must be degraded . Cdc20 - dependent degradation of Clb5 was proposed to be essential for mitotic exit , as cdc20 D pds1 D clb5 D cells are viable 3 . To determine whether APC Cdc20 - dependent Clb5 degradation was dependent on the Clb5 destruction box ( D box ) 9 , 10 we expressed Clb5 and Clb5 D db ( where the D box is deleted ) from the GAL1 promoter in cdc20 D or CDC20 cells . cdc20 deletion stabilized Clb5 ( ref . 3 ) . Deletion of the Clb5 D box stabilized Clb5 similarly with or without CDC20 ( Fig . 1a ) , suggesting that the D box was the main target for Cdc20 recognition . Inactivation of additional candidate Clb5 D boxes ( RXXL ) , SCF or Cdh1 did not affect Clb5 stability ( Supplementary Information Fig . S1a , b ) . Unexpectedly , D - box deletion from endogenous CLB5 had little cell cycle phenotype , although Clb5 abundance was signiﬁcantly deregulated ( Figs 1b , c and 2f , g ) . Thus D - box - dependent Clb5 degradation is not required for exit from mitosis and viability . To examine the D - box dependence of Clb5 proteolysis at endogenous expression levels during mitotic exit , we constructed cdc20 D pds1 D GALL - CDC20 yeast strains 3 containing CLB5 or CLB5 D db ( exact gene replacement ) . Both strains arrested before mitotic exit on glucose medium ( unlike cdc20 D pds1 D clb5 D ( ref . 3 ) ) , indicating that CLB5 D db restrained mitotic exit in the cdc20 D pds1 D background . Therefore it is unlikely that the Clb5 D box is required for inhibition of mitotic exit , although it could still be required for other untested mitotic Clb5 functions . GALL - CDC20 re - induction released mitotic arrest ( Fig . 1d – f ) , and wild - type Clb5 was completely degraded 20 min later . Clb5 D db showed only moderate decline at later time points . The mitotic cyclins Clb2 and Clb3 were degraded rapidly after release , in both strains , and this degradation initiated while Clb5 D db levels were high ( Fig . 1e , f ) . Thus , signiﬁcantly inhibiting APC Cdc20 - dependent Clb5 degra - dation had no effect on mitotic exit ( Fig . 1d – f ) . The moderate decline in levels of Clb5 D db in this experiment could result from minor Cdc20 - dependent degradation signals in Clb5 that are independent of the D box . This decline is probably not required for mitotic exit , as strong overexpression of Clb5 D db - haemagglutinin ( HA ) from the GAL1 promoter caused lethality but did not block mitotic exit 10 . Furthermore , amino - terminal Myc - tagging made Clb5 D db almost completely stable , and was lethal at endogenous expression levels without an evident block to mitotic exit ( Supplementary Information Fig . S2a , b ) . It is possible that the moderate Cdc20 - dependent decline in Clb5 D db could combine with inhibition by the Sic1 Clb kinase inhibitor 11 to effectively eliminate Clb5 D db activity at endogenous expression levels . There - fore , to more fully deregulate Clb5 D db activity we also deleted SIC1 . CLB5 D db sic1 D GAL - SIC1 strains were semi - lethal on glucose medium ( GAL - SIC1 off ) ( Fig . 2f ) , but a shift to glucose caused accumulation of cells with replicated but unseparated DNA , and without long mitotic spindles ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus these cells were primarily defective in entry into mitosis and not in mitotic exit . We constructed a CLB5 D db sic1 D GAL - SIC1 cdc15 - 2 strain to examine a single cycle of mitotic exit . These cells exited mitosis ( disassembled mitotic spindles ) after release from cdc15 - 2 anaphase block , despite Sic1 depletion ( to below the level of detection ) for 4 h in glucose medium at 37 8 C ( Fig . 3a ) . Compare Sic1 re - accumu - lation in cdc15 - 2 SIC1 strains , 10 – 20 min before spindle disassembly ( Fig . 3a ) . Unlike Clb5 , Clb5 D db persisted through the cdc15 - 2 anaphase block and subsequent release ( Fig . 3a ) . To examine mitotic exit in sic1 D CLB5 D db cells in an unper - turbed cell cycle , we incubated a sic1 D CLB5 D db GAL - SIC1 strain in glucose medium to deplete Sic1 , elutriated small - budded cells and released into mating - factor to block the succeeding cell cycle after mitosis . Incubation in glucose for 30 min depleted Sic1 to about physiological levels in the initial elutriated fraction , but cell division occurred normally ( Fig . 3b ) . Incubation in glucose for 60 min depleted Sic1 to below the level of detection , and most cells still completed cell division on schedule ( Fig . 3b ) . The small number of cells that failed to divide were mostly blocked before nuclear division . Thus , we observed no inhibition of mitotic exit by Clb5 D db , even in the absence of Sic1 . Clb5 D db only gradually letters to nature NATURE | VOL 418 | 1 AUGUST 2002 | www . nature . com / nature 556 © 2002 Nature PublishingGroup declined through these time courses , in contrast to the sharp drop in wild - type Clb5 . CLB5 D db sic1 D GAL - SIC1 cells incubated transiently in glucose showed high loss rates of a single - replication - origin plasmid but not of a multi - origin plasmid 12 ( Fig . 2g ) , suggesting problems with origin usage 10 . Defects in chromosomal replication could explain reduced viability and pre - mitotic delay of CLB5 D db sic1 D mutants ( Figs 2b , f and 3a , b ) . Undegraded Clb5 was suggested to block mitotic exit by phos - phorylation and inactivation of Sic1 and Cdh1 ( refs 3 , 4 , 6 ) . We found , however , that sic1 D cdh1 D cdc15 - 2 GAL - SIC1 strains dis - assembled mitotic spindles on cdc15 - 2 release after depletion of Sic1 ( Fig . 3a ) . These cells also exhibit signiﬁcant replication of DNA in the next cell cycle ( Supplementary Information Fig . S3b ) . Further - more , sic1 D cdh1 D CDC15 GAL - SIC1 strains depleted of Sic1 could complete cell division after release of a nocodazole block ( Sup - plementary Information Fig . S4 ) . Shifting cdh1 D sic1 D GAL - SIC1 strains from galactose to glucose results not in a block of mitotic exit , but in cell cycle delays with replicated but unseparated DNA without long mitotic spindles , similar to CLB5 D db sic1 D GAL - SIC1 strains ( Fig . 2b , d , e ) . Both strains show slow proliferation on glucose medium ( Fig . 2f ) . An interesting difference that we cannot yet interpret is endoreplication in cdh1 D sic1 D strains ( Fig . 2d , e ) . Clb2 - associated H1 kinase activity does not drop during mitotic release of the cdh1 D sic1 D cdc15 - 2 strain , unlike in wild type ( Fig . 3a ) . Transient inactivation of mitotic kinase is sufﬁcient to promote re - replication at different positions of the cell cycle , leading to the suggestion that inactivation of mitotic kinase at mitotic exit might be required for accurate DNA replication 13 . This may account for reduced viability of cdh1 D sic1 D strains and CLB5 D db sic1 D strains , and for plasmid loss in CLB5 D db sic1 D strains ( Fig . 2f , g ) . A 10 - min delay in the loss of mitotic spindles on cdc15 release in a cdh1 D strain 14 is also observed in the cdh1 D sic1 D double mutant ( Fig . 3a ) . There are also some differences in microtubule mor - phology after mitosis in cdh1 D and cdh1 D sic1 D strains compared with wild type ( Supplementary Information Fig . S3a ) . These differ - ences could be due to incomplete Clb degradation , or to a failure to degrade Ase1 , a protein required for spindle maintenance . Ase1 degradation is Cdh1 - dependent 15 , 16 , and expression of undegrad - able Ase1 during cdc15 release causes a 10 - min delay in spindle breakdown 15 . Undegraded Clb5 was proposed to inactivate Cdh1 ( refs 3 , 6 , 17 , 18 ) . Consistent with this , the Cdh1 target Clb2 is almost as stable on release of a CLB5 D db sic1 D strain as in a cdh1 D sic1 D strain ( Fig . 3a ) .

The Cdc14 phosphatase is essential for mitotic exit , and Cdc14 dephosphorylates and activates Cdh1 and Sic1 ( ref . 5 ) . If these were the only Cdc14 targets , then sic1 D cdh1 D deletion should block mitotic exit . Thus Cdc14 probably has additional targets , such as Cdc15 ( ref . 19 ) or Cdc6 ( ref . 20 ) . Cdc6 may be redundant with Sic1 for inhibition of Clb kinase in mitotic exit 20 , and if it is activated by Cdc14 , then this could allow for some regulation during mitotic exit even in the sic1 D cdh1 D strain . However , we did not detect inhibition in bulk Clb2 - associated kinase measurements in cdh1 D sic1 D strains exiting mitosis ( Fig . 3a ) . Perhaps the relevant inhi - bition occurs locally at origins of replication , where Cdc6 is bound . Our data argue against the idea 3 that Cdc20 - dependent Clb5 degradation is required for mitotic exit . Neither blocking Clb5 degradation , nor removing Cdh1 and Sic1 , the presumed targets of Clb5 ( ref . 3 ) , prevents mitotic exit . However , the role of Cdh1 in mitosis might be more complex , because other proteins important for mitotic control are subject to Cdh1 - dependent degradation , including Ase1 ( refs 15 , 16 ) , Cdc5 ( ref . 21 ) , and perhaps Cdc20 itself 17 , 22 . Some of the mitotic cyclins Clb1 – 4 might be essential APC Cdc20 targets . Although Cdh1 is signiﬁcant in controlling proteolysis of the major mitotic cyclin Clb2 ( refs 14 , 16 ) , Cdc20 may provide a ﬁrst phase of Clb2 degradation operating at higher levels of Clb2 ( ref . 23 ) . To test the requirement for Clb2 degradation , we deleted the D box from the endogenous CLB2 gene . SIC1 overexpression was required for viability of CLB2 D db strains ( Fig . 2c , f ) . Shut - off of GAL - SIC1 in CLB2 D db GAL - SIC1 strains caused arrest as large budded cells , with replicated DNA , separated nuclei and long mitotic spindles ( Fig . 2c ) . These cells frequently exhibited multiple buds after prolonged arrest ( not shown ) , but still most contained a single , long anaphase spindle . We were surprised that blocking Clb2 degradation bydeletion of the D box prevented mitotic exit , because although Cdh1 was thought to control most Clb2 degradation , cdh1 deletion does not block mitotic exit or viability 14 , 16 . Also , CLB2 D db expressed from a truncated promoter 14 or the CLB5 promoter 9 allows viability . With precise endogenous gene replacement , how - ever , CLB2 D db ( unlike CLB5 D db ) blocks mitotic exit . Failure to exit mitosis owing to CLB2 D db was also observed in cdc15 - 2 block and release ( Fig . 3a , and Supplementary Information Fig . S3a , b ) , and nocodazole block and release ( Supplementary Information Fig . S4 ) . This failure was associated with high levels of Clb2 D db . Notably , more Clb2 accumulated in CLB2 D db strains ( failing mitotic exit ) than in cdh1 D sic1 D strains ( achieving mitotic exit ) ( Fig . 3a ) . Clb2 D db may block mitotic exit nearly autonomously . clb5 D Figure 2 CLB2 D db but not CLB5 D db sic1 D or cdh1 D sic1 D blocks mitotic exit . a – e , Cells of the indicated genotypes stained for spindles ( anti - tubulin ; red ) and DNA ( DAPI ; blue ) after depletion of GAL - SIC1 for 2 . 5h .

Also , clb1 , 3 D CLB2 D db GAL - SIC1 and clb3 , 4 D CLB2 D db GAL - SIC1 strains were inviable on glucose medium ( data not shown ) . ( We could not construct a clb1 , 3 , 4 D CLB2 D db GAL - SIC1 strain , for unknown reasons . ) If Clb2 is an essential target for Cdc20 - mediated D - box - depen - dent degradation along with Pds1 ( ref . 8 ) , this could explain mitotic arrest of both cdc20 D pds1 D strains and CDC20 PDS1 CLB2 D db strains . Clb2 was strongly stabilized by either deletion of cdc20 or deletion of the D box ( Fig . 4a ) . cdh1 deletion had less marked effects , so in cycling cells Cdc20 may control the bulk of D - box - dependent Clb2 degradation ( Fig . 4c ) . To examine Cdc20 - dependent Clb2 degradation at endogenous Clb2 expression levels in synchronized cells , we blocked and released cdc20 D GALL - CDC20 strains carrying either CDH1 or cdh1 D ( Fig . 4f ) .

KEN boxes , as well as D boxes , control Cdh1 - dependent degra - dation 22 . Two KEN boxes in Clb2 , as well as the D box , were required for efﬁcient Cdh1 - dependent degradation ( Fig . 4d , e ) . KEN mutation had minor effects on Clb2 stability in cycling cells ( Fig . 4b ) and no effect in cdh1 D cells ( Fig . 4c ) , suggesting that Cdc20 - dependent Clb2 degradation may be largely KEN - independent . KEN - box mutation in endogenous Clb2 did not prevent viability ( data not shown ) , unlike D - box deletion . D - box deletion may therefore prevent mitotic exit by speciﬁcally blocking Cdc20 - dependent Clb2 degradation , although an additional effect from interfering with Cdh1 - dependent degradation cannot be ruled out . APC Cdc20 may initiate Clb2 degradation 23 . Cdc20 - dependent Clb2 degradation is not complete , but may be sufﬁcient to allow mitotic exit , even in the absence of Cdh1 and Sic1 ( Fig . 5 ) . Sic1 and APC Cdh1 provide a second phase of Clb regulation that is not required for most aspects of mitotic exit . Although Cdh1 / Sic1 regulation may contribute to Clb2 – Cdk1 inactivation during mito - tic exit , much of the biological signiﬁcance of this regulation may be in G1 , as cdh1 D cells ( Fig . 4g ) and sic1 D cells 11 initiate DNA replication prematurely . The main role of Cdh1 in various eukary - otes may be to maintain a low mitotic cyclin state in G1 , perhaps to allow differentiation 24 – 26 . Viability of the cdc20 D pds1 D clb5 D strain 3 demonstrates the potential for a Cdc20 - independent cell cycle oscillator . This oscil - lator differs from wild type in making the normally dispensable Cdh1 essential 3 , and it also requires the absence of Pds1 and Clb5 , which may antagonize Cdh1 ( see Supplementary Information for further discussion ) . In contrast , the wild - type cell cycle may be primarily governed by a Cdc20 - dependent oscillatory mechanism ( as in embryonic cell cycles 24 , 27 , 28 ) , which could involve cyclical Clb - dependent activation of APC Cdc20 by phosphorylation 28 , 29 .

Thus , in the absence of APC phosphorylation , a Cdh1 - dependent oscillator becomes essential ( as in the cdc20 D pds1 D clb5 D background 3 ) . In the wild - type cell cycle , the Cdh1 - depen - dent oscillator may function predominantly as a mechanism pro - viding G1 stability after exit from mitosis . Cdc20 and Cdh1 are regulated oppositely by Clb kinase , so these two proposed oscillators may work by entirely different principles . The presence of distinct Cdc20 and Cdh1 orthologues in budding and ﬁssion yeast , ﬂies , and humans suggest that this proposed double oscillator may have arisen very early in eukaryotic evolution . A Methods Strain and plasmid construction Fordetails of strainand plasmid construction see Supplementary Information . All strains were of the W303 background . GALL - CDC20 cdc20 D pds1 D and clb5 D : : HIS3 were from M . Shirayama . CLB5 and CLB2 D - box deletions were described previously 9 , 10 . KEN - box mutation of CLB2 was carried out by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and subcloning . The ‘ ken1 ’ mutation was K100A , E101A , N102A ; ‘ ken1 , 2 ’ was K85A , E86A , N87A ; K100A , E101A , N102A . Replacement of CLB5 with CLB5 D db was as described for HA - CLB5 D db ( ref . 9 ) . Replacement of CLB2 with CLB2 D db was carried out by integration – excision using LEU2 - CLB2 integrated adjacent to clb2 D : : URA3 , followed by 5 - ﬂuoro - orotic acid selection of pop - outs . Single - copy integration was conﬁrmed by Southernblottingandequalexpressionlevelswerecomparedtoawild - typestrain ( W303 ) by northern blotting . The GAL - SIC1 cassette was from A . Amon . For most experiments a one - copy stable GAL - SIC1 integrant ( 1 £ ) was used . cdh1 D sic1 D mutants isolated with this cassette were all diploidized , so for most experiments with cdh1 D sic1 D strains a two - copy ( 2 £ ) integrant was used . The GAL - CLB5 and GAL - CLB2 cassettes were made from the HA - tagged versions 10 by digestion with Not I and re - ligation . Therefore , GAL - CLB constructs contained three N - terminal amino acids derived from the Not I site . Experiments with CLB5 and CLB5 D db indicate no biological effect of these three amino acids . Cells of the indicated genotype ( Fig . 2g ) for the plasmid loss assay—also ade3 D : : URA3 and carrying pLEU2 - ADE3 * plasmids 12 with one or seven origins of replication—were constructed by tetrad analysis using ade3 D : : URA3 plasmid - bearing , W303 - background strains provided by E . Schwob . All strains also contained a single copy of integrated GAL1 : : SIC1 . A clb2 D : : URA3 strain with two integrated copies of GALL - CDH1 - m11 ( ref . 6 ) was transformed with LEU2 - integrating CLB2 plasmids . The plasmid contained a truncated CLB2 promoter , providing low enough expression that Clb2 D db was not lethal . GALL - CDH1 - m11 produces mutant Cdh1 that cannot be inactivated by phosphorylation , and therefore induces cell cycle arrest and constitutive Clb2 degradation 6 . Plasmid loss assay Starter cultures were grown in Gal - Leu medium , then grown in YEPGal for 5h , and resuspendedinYEPD ( GAL - SIC1 off ) for5h . BeforeandafterYEPDincubation , cultures were streaked out on YEPGal solid medium . The frequency of plasmid loss events was determined as the frequency of white or pink - white , half - sectored ( or less than half - sectored ) colonies divided by the number of colonies ( excluding rare red colonies ) . The inducedfrequencyofplasmid losswas the frequencyofloss after YEPD growthminus the frequency before YEPD growth . Western blotting and other procedures Shut - off experiments to measurestability from GAL - CLB genes wasas described 10 , except that pds1 D strainsandcontrolsweretestedat23 8 C , galactoseinductionwasfor1handall strains were resuspended in fresh glucose medium for promoter repression . We used untagged Clb5 because of artefactual effects of tagging on Clb5 stability ( Supplementary Information Fig . S2a ) . In experiments with a - factor blocked cells , cycloheximide ( 1mgml 2 1 ) was added at t (cid:136) 0min . GALL - CDH1 - m11 ( ref . 6 ) strains expressing various CLB2 mutants ( truncated CLB2 promoter ) were grown in rafﬁnose , and Cdh1 was induced by 2 . 5h incubation in galactose . DNA content analysis , RNA analysis , elutriation , immunoblotting , H1 kinase assays , and 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) and anti - tubulin staining were as described 10 , 30 . We established speciﬁcity and antibody excess for the Clb2 - associated kinase assays by appropriate controls . Anti - Clb antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; anti - Sic1 antibody was a gift from M . Tyers . Dilutions were : anti - Clb5 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) , Clb3 ( 1 : 500 ) , Clb2 ( 1 : 1 , 000 – 1 : 10 , 000 ) , Sic1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) .

APC Cdc20 degradesthemitoticcyclinClb2toalevellow enough to allow spindle disassembly and cell division . This intermediate level might still interfere with efﬁcient DNA replication in the next cell cycle 13 ( dashed line ; see text ) . APC Cdc20 - dependent proteolysis of the S phase cyclin Clb5 prevents Clb5 - dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of Cdh1 and the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 ( ref . 3 ) . This allows the phosphatase Cdc14 ( not shown ) to activate APC Cdh1 and Sic1 ( ref . 5 ) . APC Cdh1 degrades Clb2 further during mitotic exit and in the succeeding G1 , and this , combined with inhibition by Sic1 , maintains a very low Clb activity level , regulating the length of G1 and probably allowing efﬁcient DNA replication . Cdc14 must have additional targets promoting mitotic exit ( see text ) . letters to nature NATURE | VOL 418 | 1 AUGUST 2002 | www . nature . com / nature 561 © 2002 Nature PublishingGroup 27 .

The Mre11 complex ( Mre11 – Rad50 – Nbs1 ) is central to chromo - somal maintenance and functions in homologous recombina - tion , telomere maintenance and sister chromatid association 1 – 7 . These functions all imply that the linked binding of two DNA substrates occurs , although the molecular basis for this process remains unknown . Here we present a 2 . 2 A˚ crystal structure of the Rad50 coiled - coil region that reveals an unexpected dimer interface at the apexof the coiled coils inwhich pairs of conserved Cys - X - X - Cys motifs form interlocking hooks that bind one Zn 2 1 ion . Biochemical , X - ray and electron microscopy data indicate that these hooks can join oppositely protruding Rad50 coiled - coil domains to form a ﬂexible bridge of up to 1 , 200 A˚ . This suggests a function for the long insertion in the Rad50 ABC - ATPase domain 8 . The Rad50 hook is functional , because mutations in this motif confer radiation sensitivity in yeast and disrupt binding at the distant Mre11 nuclease interface . These data support an architectural role for the Rad50 coiled coils in forming metal - mediated bridging complexes between two DNA - binding heads . The resulting assemblies have appropriate lengths and conformational properties to link sister chromatids in homologous recombination and DNA ends in non - homolo - gous end - joining . Orthologues of the DNA double - strand break repair nuclease Mre11 and the ATPase Rad50 exist in all kingdoms of life and function as a heterotetrameric ( Mre11 ) 2 / ( Rad50 ) 2 complex ( M2R2 ) 8 . In eukaryotes , the Mre11 complex can contain a third Figure 1 Rad50 domains , sequence conservation of the CXXC motif and Zn 2 (cid:135) - mediated dimerization of Rad50 . a , Domainstructure of Rad50 and multiple sequencealignment of thecentralportionoftheRad50coiledcoilshowingtheconservedCXXCmotif .
