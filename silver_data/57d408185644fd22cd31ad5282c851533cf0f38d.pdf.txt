To deﬁne the role of ER at this unique MCS , we targeted a promiscuous biotin ligase to cargo - sorting domains on endosome buds . This strategy identiﬁed the ER membrane pro - tein TMCC1 , a member of a conserved protein family . TMCC1 concentrates at the ER - endosome MCSs that are spatially and temporally linked to endosome ﬁssion . When TMCC1 is depleted , endosome morphology is normal , buds still form , but ER - asso - ciated bud ﬁssion and subsequent cargo sorting to the Golgi are impaired . We ﬁnd that the endosome - localized actin regulator Coronin 1C is required for ER - associated ﬁssion of actin - dependent cargo - sorting domains . Coronin 1C is recruited to endo - some buds independently of TMCC1 , while TMCC1 / ER recruitment requires Coronin 1C . This link between TMCC1 and Coronin 1C suggests that the timing of TMCC1 - dependent ER recruitment is tightly regulated to occur after cargo has been prop - erly sequestered into the bud . INTRODUCTION The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) spreads throughout the cyto - plasm as an interconnected network of membrane tubules and cisternae . ER tubules are highly dynamic and move in a motor - dependent fashion along the microtubule ( MT ) cytoskel - eton ( Lee and Chen , 1988 ; Terasaki et al . , 1984 ; Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1998 ) . A striking feature of these dynamic ER tubules is that they are linked to other cytoplasmic organ - elles through membrane contact sites ( MCS ) ( for reviews , see Phillips and Voeltz [ 2016 ] ; Prinz [ 2014 ] ; Salvador - Gallego et al . [ 2017 ] ; Friedman et al . [ 2010 ] ; Zajac et al . [ 2013 ] ) . We have recently described a surprising new function for MCSs be - tween ER tubules and endosomes . Dynamic ER tubules form MCS at the base of endosome budding domains and deﬁne the position and timing of endosome ﬁssion ( Rowland et al . , 2014 ) . Membrane ﬁssion is essential to early and late endosome function . Endosomes sort signaling receptors or nutrient car - gos for recycling or degradation . Cargo destined for recycling to the plasma membrane ( PM ) or trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) is packaged into a tubular structure that buds from the endo - some vacuolar domain . The cargo that remains behind in the vacuolar domain is later degraded when late endosomes fuse with lysosomes . Several well - characterized factors regulate formation of the budding domain and the partitioning of cargoes into these distinct sorting domains . Microtubules and their motor proteins aid in creating membrane tension by pulling out the budding membrane , which is subsequently sta - bilized and shaped by the membrane shaping proteins , sorting nexins ( SNXs ) . Cargo is then sorted into the newly formed bud and retained by the combined action of the cargo - binding ret - romer and Arp2 / 3 branched actin networks generated by WASH ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gautreau et al . , 2014 ; Hunt et al . , 2013 ; Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . While much is known about the process of bud formation and cargo sequestration into the bud , it is not clear what machinery drives ER MCS for - mation with the bud to regulate the timing of ER - associ - ated ﬁssion . We have observed that dynamic ER tubules form MCSs with the endosome bud to drive ER - associated ﬁssion after the cargo domain is established ( Rowland et al . , 2014 ) . This sequence of events suggests that sorting domains must be properly established before the ER can be recruited . We set out to identify the mechanism by which a primed budding domain would signal ER recruitment , as well as the molecular machineries required to establish this contact . Our strategy was to localize the promiscuous biotin ligase , BioID , to the en - dosome budding domain in order to identify factors involved in ER - associated endosome ﬁssion . With this strategy , we have discovered a role for the ER protein TMCC1 in driving MCS for - mation between dynamic ER tubules and endosome sorting domains , which orchestrates ER - associated bud ﬁssion . TMCC1 speciﬁcally regulates ER recruitment to endosome buds primed with the actin regulating protein Coronin 1C . Addi - tionally , we have found that TMCC1 and Coronin 1C coordinate to facilitate the timing of ER recruitment for ER - associated en - dosome ﬁssion . 254 Cell 175 , 254 – 265 , September 20 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Inc . RESULTS Identiﬁcation of ER - Endosome MCS Proteins by Proximity Biotinylation Our goal was to identify ER proteins speciﬁcally localized to MCSs between dynamic ER tubules and the position of endo - some ﬁssion . A challenging feature of these contacts is that they are extremely transient and occupy a relatively small sur - face area of the endosome . Toward this goal , we took advantage of a proximity - based labeling system , BioID , a biotin ligase mutated to promiscuously biotinylate proteins within (cid:1) 10 – 30 nm ( Kim et al . , 2014 ; Roux et al . , 2012 ) . We previously deter - mined that FAM21 , a component of the WASH complex , localizes discretely to the endosome bud at the position of ER contact and ﬁssion ( Rowland et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , we generated a fusion protein using FAM21 to target BioID to the endosome bud and biotinylate nearby ER MCS proteins . To conﬁrm FAM21 localization was unaffected , Cos7 cells were transiently co - transfected with a general ER marker ( BFP - Sec61 b ) , a late endosome marker ( mCh - Rab7 ) , and GFP - BioID - FAM21 and then imaged live by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy . The GFP - BioID - FAM21 correctly localized to the endosome bud , and these domains successfully execute ﬁssion ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . We also tested whether the fusion protein was enzymatically active and capable of biotinylating proteins at ER MCSs . Cos7 cells were co - transfected with GFP - BioID - FAM21 , BFP - Sec61 b , and mCh - Rab7 . Biotin was added ( 5 m M for 1 hr ) , the cells were ﬁxed , and biotinylation was visualized with a strepta - vidin probe conjugated to a ﬂuorescent label ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Discrete patches of biotin were observed at MCS between ER tubules and FAM21 puncta on the endosome sorting domain ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells ( Figures S1A and S1B ) . To purify biotinylated ER MCS proteins , we transfected HeLa cells with GFP - BioID - FAM21 and incubated with biotin ( as before ) . We performed two parallel control experiments where cells were transfected with a GFP - FAM21 construct ( mock , without BioID fused ) or with myc - BioID - Rab7 ( designed to bio - tinylate proteins on the entire surface of late endosomes and may also biotinylate ER proteins found at various endosome MCSs ) ( Figure 1E ) . We then lysed the cells and enriched for ER membrane proteins by performing a series of differential centri - fugation steps . Extracts were depleted of cell debris , nuclei , mitochondria , and cytosol , while isolating a 20 , 000 3 g pellet ( light membrane fraction ) . Immunoblot analysis conﬁrmed the presence of both ER and endosomal proteins within this ﬁnal fraction ( Figure 1F ) . To purify biotinylated proteins , the light membrane fraction was solubilized and applied to streptavidin - conjugated beads . Bound proteins were eluted in SDS - biotin buffer ( as described in STAR Methods ) . The elutions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and probed with streptavidin - HRP , which conﬁrmed that the GFP - BioID - FAM21 sample had a unique biotinylation proﬁle compared to the two controls ( Fig - ures 1G and S1C ) . The eluted biotinylated samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry . The sample containing BioID fused to either Rab7 or FAM21 contained peptide spectral matches ( Old et al . , 2005 ) to the known ER - endosome MCS pro - teins VAPA and VAPB ( Figure 1H , middle row ) ( Alpy et al . , 2013 ; Dong et al . , 2016 ; Rocha et al . , 2009 ) . The GFP - BioID - FAM21 sample was further enriched with peptides for known FAM21 in - teracting proteins ( Figure 1H , top rows ) ( Freeman et al . , 2014 ; Harbour et al . , 2012 ; Jia et al . , 2012 ) , as well as a single ER mem - brane protein candidate , TMCC1 , which was identiﬁed with four unique peptides and was not found in controls ( Figures 1H , bot - tom row , and S1D ) . We validated whether the TMCC1 candidate functions during retromer - mediated cargo sorting from endosome buds . We efﬁ - ciently depleted TMCC1 versus known retromer - mediated cargo - sorting factors ( WASH component FAM21 or the retromer component VPS35 ) using small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) ( Fig - ure S1E ) and scored whether CI - MPR cargo is still trafﬁcked from endosomes to the TGN as previously described ( Arighi et al . , 2004 ; Bonifacino and Rojas , 2006 ; Burd and Cullen , 2014 ; Seaman et al . , 1998 ) . To measure CI - MPR trafﬁcking , we incubated control versus siRNA - treated cells with an antibody that binds the extracellularly exposed portion of CI - MPR at the plasma membrane ( Dong et al . , 2016 ) . After 1 hr incubation , the intracellular distribution of CI - MPR antibody was detected by immunoﬂuorescence . The overall levels of CI - MPR in control cells versus TMCC1 KD cells remained consistent ( Figure S1E ) . In control cells , the CI - MPR antibody was internalized with the receptor and accumulated at the Golgi ( Figure 1I , left panel ) . In contrast , cells that were depleted for TMCC1 , FAM21 , or VPS35 all had a signiﬁcant reduction in CI - MPR ﬂuorescence at the Golgi , concomitant with increased levels of ﬂuorescence at peripheral vesicles ( Figures 1I and 1J ) . These data demon - strate that depletion of the ER - resident protein TMCC1 produces a similar defect in endosome retromer - mediated cargo sorting to that observed upon depletion of known cargo - sorting components . TMCCs Localize to Dynamic Domains on ER Tubules , and All Regulate Endosome Cargo Sorting TMCC1 is an ER membrane protein conserved throughout meta - zoans , with two additionally ER - localized paralogs in mammalian cells ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Sequence analysis predicts that all TMCC family members contain three conserved coiled coil ( CC ) and two transmembrane ( TM ) domains ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 2A ) . We cloned TMCC1 , TMCC2 , and TMCC3 from HeLa cDNA and created GFP fusions to analyze their subcellular localization . Cos7 cells were co - transfected with TMCC1 , TMCC2 , or TMCC3 and a general ER marker Sec61 b . The general ER protein localizes to all domains of the ER including the nuclear envelope ( NE ) and the peripheral ER network of tubules and cisternae . In contrast , TMCC family members do not localize homogenously throughout the ER , rather they each concentrate in discrete patches along periph - eral ER tubules and are depleted from the ﬂat sheet of the nu - clear envelope ( Figures 2B – 2D and S2A – S2C ) . These peripheral TMCC patches are dynamic , with concentrations of the protein accumulating and then dissipating at certain places on the tubular network ( Video S1 ) . When TMCC1 was expressed as either an mCh - or a 3xFlag - tagged fusion protein , it showed the same distribution ( Figures S2D and S2E ) . In contrast , a trun - cated TMCC1 mutant ( TMCC1 D 1 - 570 ) that lacks the conserved Cell 175 , 254 – 265 , September 20 , 2018 255 N - terminal cytoplasmic domain , does not localize to dynamic domains ( Figure S2F ) and is instead distributed throughout the entire ER . Based on the strikingly similar localization of the TMCC protein family , we next asked if TMCC1 – TMCC3 have redundant func - tions in cargo trafﬁcking from late endosomes to the TGN . m C h - R ab7 G F P - B i o I D - F A M 21 m C h - R ab7 G F P - B i o I D - F A M 21 B F P - S e c 61 m C h - R ab7 B F P - K D E L GFP - BioID - FAM21 Biotin Merge A B m C h - R ab7 G F P - B i o I D - F A M 21 B F P - K D E L B i o t i n 0s 5s 10s C D CI - MPR internalization Control siRNA TMCC1 KD siRNA C I - M P R i mm uno f l uo r e sc en c e r a t i o ( V e s i c u l a r / G o l g i ) * * * C on t r o l T M CC 1 F A M 21 VPS 35 * * * * * * 3 . 6 2 . 1 4 . 4 4 . 9 ER Retromer ( VPS35 ) Signaling Receptor Cargo ( CI - MPR ) WASH complex ( FAM21 ) Actin Arp2 / 3 Cortactin Coronin J I Bud fission , then cargo trafficked to trans Golgi network Rab7 Late Endosome 1 . ) GFP - BioID - FAM21 2 . ) GFP - FAM21 " mock " ( no BioID ) 3 . ) myc - BioID - Rab7 3 conditions , 1hr 50 μ M biotinylation : cell lysis & enrichment for ER / endosome membrane fraction Rtn3 Tubulin Rab7 Tom20 ( 1 ) 600xg to pellet debris / nuclei ( 2 ) 7000xg to pellet mitochondria ( 3 ) 20 , 000xg to pellet ER / endosomes streptavidin capture of biotinylated proteins LC / MS analysis B i o I D - F A M 21 B i o I D - R ab7 m o ck B i o I D - F A M 21 B i o I D - R ab7 m o ck B i o I D - F A M 21 B i o I D - R ab7 m o ck B i o I D - F A M 21 B i o I D - R ab7 m o ck B i o I D - F A M 21 B i o I D - R ab7 m o ck Streptavidin 250kD - 150kD - 100kD - 75kD - 50kD - 37kD - 25kD - 20kD - * * G F H E m C h - R ab7 G F P - B i o I D - F A M 21 B F P - S e c 61 0 2 4 6 8 10 VPS35 KD siRNA FAM21 KD siRNA VPS35 KD siRNA Fam21 interactors Spectral Hits CAPZB FAM21 ( 46 ) Rab7 ( 3 ) mock ( 0 ) RME - 8 FAM21 ( 26 ) Rab7 ( 4 ) mock ( 2 ) FKBP15 FAM21 ( 15 ) Rab7 ( 3 ) mock ( 0 ) Strumpellin FAM21 ( 5 ) Rab7 ( 1 ) mock ( 0 ) CCDC22 FAM21 ( 4 ) Rab7 ( 0 ) mock ( 0 ) ER - endosome MCS proteins VAPA / VAPB FAM21 ( 4 ) Rab7 ( 4 ) mock ( 0 ) Candidate ER protein TMCC1 FAM21 ( 4 ) Rab7 ( 0 ) mock ( 0 ) Fam21 interactors SpectralHits Candidate ER protein Spectral Hits Spectral Hits ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) siRNA : Figure 1 .

See also Figure S1 . 256 Cell 175 , 254 – 265 , September 20 , 2018 Only TMCC1 can be detected by immuno - blot analysis in both Cos7 and HeLa cells , and presumably TMCC2 and TMCC3 pro - teins are not abundant in our cell systems ( Figures S2G – S2I ) . We probed TMCC1 - 3 redundancy by analyzing whether the CI - MPR sorting defect due to TMCC1 siRNA treatment could be rescued by reintroduction of siRNA - resistant TMCC1 , or by introducing TMCC2 , or TMCC3 ( Figures 2E , 2F , and S2G ) . Considering that TMCC1 was speciﬁcally identiﬁed by our proximity labeling system and the three TMCCs appear to function redundantly , we decided to probe the role of the TMCC family in endosome biogenesis using TMCC1 as a proxy . TMCC1 Localizes to the Timing and Position of ER - Associated Endosome Fission TMCC1’s localization to dynamic domains that move along ER tubules is compelling , so we therefore wondered whether these TMCC1 dynamic domains accumulate at ER MCSs coincident with the position and timing of endosome ﬁssion . To test this , we monitored the enrichment of several ER resident proteins relative to the position of ER contact during ﬁssion ( Figures 3A – 3D , arrow marks position ) . Qualitatively and quantitatively TMCC1 concentrates at the position of ﬁssion when compared to the general ER protein Sec61 b ( Figures 3A , 3E – 3G , and S3A – S3C ) . Importantly , TMCC1 does not accumulate on ER sur - rounding the vacuolar compartment of the endosome ( arrow - head marks vacuolar contact , Figures 3A , S3A , and S3B ) . In contrast , the truncated TMCC1 mutant protein ( TMCC1 D 1 - 570 ) lacking the N terminus ( Figure S2F ) that does not localize to dynamic domains , does not accumulate at ER MCSs with the position of ﬁssion ( Figures 3B , 3E , 3F , and S3D ) . We next compared TMCC1 distribution to the localization of Protrudin , an ER protein that has previously been shown to localize at ER - endosome MCS to load endosomes on kinesin for antero - grade trafﬁcking ( Matsuzaki et al . , 2011 ; Raiborg et al . , 2015 ) . Protrudin has a reversed accumulation pattern compared to TMCC1—it is enriched at ER MCSs with the vacuolar compart - ment but it is not enriched at MCSs with the bud ( Figures 3C , 3E , 3F , and S3E ) . Finally , we measured the distribution of the ER MCS protein VAP , which is known to localize homogenously throughout ER tubules to regulate PI4P metabolism at a variety of MCSs ( ER - PM , ER - Golgi , and ER - endosome ) ( Alpy et al . , 2013 ; Manford et al . , 2012 ; Mesmin et al . , 2013 ; Peretti et al . , mCh - Sec61 GFP - TMCC2 mCh - Sec61 GFP - TMCC3 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 mCh - Sec61 GFP - TMCC1 E TMCC1 KD siRNA , CI - MPR internalization GFP - C1 vector GFP - TMCC1 siRNA resistant GFP - TMCC2 GFP - TMCC3 * G F P v e c t o r G F P - T M CC 1 s i RN A r e s i s t an t G F P - T M CC 2 G F P - T M CC 3 * * 0 2 4 6 8 10 F C I - M P R i mm uno f l uo r e sc en c e r a t i o ( V e s i c u l a r / G o l g i ) 221 320 571 653 CC CC CC TM TM 420 276 477 709 657 50 154 477 280 410 375 1 2 1 2 A B C D TMCC1 : TMCC2 : TMCC3 : G F P - C 1 G o l g i G F P - T M CC 1 s i RN A r e s i s t an t G o l g i G F P - T M CC 2 G o l g i G F P - T M CC 3 G o l g i 3 . 0 4 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 3 TMCC1 siRNA Figure 2 .

The localization of VAP is similar to the general ER protein and does not appear to concentrate at MCSs with either the endo - some vacuolar compartment or the bud ( Figures 3D – 3F and S3F ) . Together , these data demonstrate that TMCC1 has a unique localization to dynamic domains that accumulate at the position and timing of bud ﬁssion ( Figure 3G ) . This unique local - ization suggests TMCC1 could function directly in ER recruit - ment during ER - associated endosome ﬁssion .

TMCC1 depletion did not alter ER morphology or dy - namics and did not alter endosome diameter or bud length ( n = 51 cells , 405 buds ) when compared to control siRNA - treated cells ( n = 47 cells , 493 buds ) ( Figures 4A – 4F ) . We used live confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy to visualize whether TMCC1 depletion altered the efﬁciency of endosome ﬁssion during 2 - min time - lapse movies ( see examples of suc - cessful versus unsuccessful ﬁssion events , Videos S3A and S3B , respectively ) . When we scored ﬁssion of all budding do - mains that formed , we saw a signiﬁcant decrease in the efﬁciency of endosome ﬁssion in TMCC1 - depleted cells compared to control cells ( from 23 . 5 % in control to 12 . 7 % in the TMCC1 knockdown , n = 47 cells , 493 buds and n = 51 cells , 405 buds , respectively ) ( Figure 4G ) . This ﬁssion defect could be rescued by re - introduction of an siRNA resistant GFP - TMCC1 protein ( Figure S4 ) . We next asked whether TMCC1 depletion would have a more pronounced effect on the efﬁciency of buds that were labeled with FAM21 because TMCC1 was identiﬁed speciﬁcally with BioID - FAM21 ( Figure 1 ) . FAM21 labeling is indicative of budding domains primed for the retromer - mediated cargo - sorting pathway ( Gomez and Billa - deau , 2009 ; Jia et al . , 2012 ) . When we score the efﬁciency of endosome bud ﬁssion for FAM21 - labeled buds , we saw a much more dramatic reduction in the efﬁciency of endosome ﬁssion ( from 30 . 4 % to 10 . 4 % , for n = 47 cells , 380 buds and n = 51 cells , 340 buds , respectively , Figure 4H ) . This signiﬁcant 3 - fold reduction suggests TMCC1 speciﬁcally regulates the process of ER - associated endosome ﬁssion for retromer - mediated cargo sorting .

Cell 175 , 254 – 265 , September 20 , 2018 259 Coronin 1C at the Endosome Bud Recruits the ER and Regulates Bud Fission We have shown that TMCC1 accumulates at MCS with endo - some buds coincident with ﬁssion ( Figure 3 ) . Additionally , TMCC1 depletion has a dramatic effect on ﬁssion of buds labeled by the WASH complex component Fam21 , a factor that provides the bridge between retromer - mediated cargo sort - ing and branched actin nucleation ( Arighi et al . , 2004 ; Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gautreau et al . , 2014 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Harbour et al . , 2010 ; Hunt et al . , 2013 ; Maxﬁeld and McGraw , 2004 ; Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ; Seaman , 2004 , 2008 ) . There - fore , we wondered what factor ( s ) on the bud regulate TMCC1 recruitment in order to drive ER - associated bud ﬁssion . Such a factor would need to recruit the ER machinery after cargo has been successfully sorted , so this factor should be at the bud with sequestered cargo prior to ER recruitment . We initially tested the WASH complex . However , Wash1 / FAM21 depletion did not affect ER recruitment to the budding domain nor did it ef - fect ﬁssion of endosome tubules ( Rowland et al . , 2014 ) ( Figures S5A – S5D ) We therefore searched a recently published protein interactome database ( Bioplex 2 . 0 ) ( Huttlin et al . , 2017 ) for TMCC - interacting factors that have been reported to localize to endosome buds and regulate retromer - mediated cargo sort - ing and / or branched actin assembly . Interestingly , TMCC2 and TMCC3 both revealed interactions with the actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein , Coronin 1A , Bioplex 2 . 0 / 3 . 0 ( Huttlin et al . , 2017 ; W . Harper , personal communication ) . This interaction could ﬁt into our model of TMCC1’s role in recruiting the ER to actin patches at the bud . Another member of the Coronin family , Coronin 1C , was previously shown to localize to actin - regulated cargo - sorting domains on endosome buds in HEK293T cells ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . Actin - stabilized microdomains are required for cargo sorting and sequestration into the budding domain ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) , making Coronin 1C an attrac - tive candidate for regulating the timing of ER recruitment to this site . Importantly , initial experiments in Cos7 cells revealed that Coronin 1C ( and not Coronin 1A ) localizes to discrete patches on endosome buds ( Figures S5F and S5G ) . We tested whether Coronin 1C depletion disrupts MCS forma - tion between dynamic ER tubules and FAM21 - labeled endo - some buds . Cells transfected with control or Coronin 1C siRNAs ( to efﬁciently deplete Coronin 1C , Figure S5G ) were co - transfected with BFP - KDEL ( red ) , GFP - Rab7 ( blue ) , and with mCh - FAM21 ( green ) to visualize co - localization between ER tubules and FAM21 domains on LE buds ( compare Figures 5A – 5C to 5D – 5F , respectively ) . We monitored the stability of ER MCS with FAM21 - labeled endosome buds over time in live cell time - lapsed images ( Figure 5G ) . When FAM21 / ER crossing was quantiﬁed frame by frame , the ER spent 79 . 0 % of the time contacting FAM21 buds in control cells ( n = 20 ) versus 41 . 4 % of the time in the Coronin 1C - depleted cells ( n = 21 ) ( Figure 5H ) . Thus , Coronin 1C depletion disrupts ER recruitment to the endo - some bud . We next tested whether Coronin 1C depletion affects endo - some ﬁssion . Similar to TMCC1 depletion , Coronin 1C siRNA treatment dramatically reduced the efﬁciency of ﬁssion for FAM21 - labeled buds ( from 28 . 0 % to 11 . 1 % ; n = 20 cells , 286 buds and n = 21 cells , 316 buds , respectively , Figure 5I ) . There - fore , we have identiﬁed two completely novel factors that directly impact endosome ﬁssion . One localizes discretely to mature en - dosome budding domains and when depleted , impairs endo - some ﬁssion and disrupts the formation of ER contact ( Coronin 1C ) . The other is ER localized , accumulates at the position and timing of endosome ﬁssion , and is also required for ﬁssion ( TMCC1 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that the actions of TMCC1 and Coronin 1C are coupled during the ﬁssion of en - dosome sorting domains . TMCC1 Regulates ER Recruitment to Endosome Buds Finally , we measured whether TMCC1 plays a direct role in regu - lating dynamic ER tubule recruitment to endosome buds to drive ER - associated endosome ﬁssion . Because Coronin 1C regu - lates ER recruitment to the bud , we conversely asked whether TMCC1 functions to regulate ER recruitment to Coronin 1C do - mains . Cells were co - transfected with control or TMCC1 siRNAs and with BFP - KDEL , mCh - Rab7 , and GFP - Coronin 1C ( Figures 6A , 6B , 6D , 6E , and S6C ) . In the absence of TMCC1 , Co - ronin 1C - labeled buds still form ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . As before ( in Figures 5C and 5D ) , we monitored the stability of ER MCSs with Coronin 1C puncta on endosome buds over time in TMCC1 siRNA - depleted cells compared to control cells . In control cells , ER tubules maintain contact with both the vacuolar compart - ment and with Coronin puncta at the base of endosome buds ( Figures 6A – 6C , 6G , and S6A ) . By comparison , in TMCC1 - depleted cells , ER tubules still maintain contact with the vacuolar compartment , but the ER rarely crosses the Coronin 1C domains at the bud ( Figures 6D – 6F , 6G and S6B ; Video S4 ) . These ana - lyses revealed a (cid:1) 2 - fold reduction ( 69 . 2 % to 35 . 2 % ) in the percent of time the ER contacts Coronin puncta following TMCC1 depletion ( Figure 6H ) . These data suggest TMCC1 directly regulates the recruitment of dynamic ER tubules to form MCS with Coronin 1C domains on the endosome bud . Coronin 1C or TMCC1 depletion yield strikingly similar defects in ER MCS formation and ER - associated endosome bud ﬁssion , suggesting this interaction regulates a precise timing mecha - nism to ensure successful receptor - mediated cargo sorting before ER recruitment and bud ﬁssion . DISCUSSION We have used a targeted promiscuous biotin ligase strategy to identify TMCC1 as an ER membrane protein that functions at ER MCSs to regulate ER - associated endosome ﬁssion . TMCC1 has an unusual localization in that it is partitioned to peripheral ER tubules and is excluded from the nuclear envelope . In addi - tion , itaccumulates intodynamic domainsthroughout thetubular network of the ER . TMCC1 dynamic domains are spatially and temporally linked to the position of ER - associated endosome ﬁssion . TMCC1depletion causedadefect inefﬁcientcargo deliv - ery from late endosomes to the Golgi . Importantly , we observed no abnormalities in endosome morphology or the biogenesis of sorting domains upon TMCC1 depletion , just a deﬁned role in ﬁssion of endosome buds . We show that TMCC1 functions to stabilize ER MCS with cargo - sorting domains on endosome buds . Together , these data argue a speciﬁc role for TMCC1 in the process of ER - associated endosome ﬁssion . 260 Cell 175 , 254 – 265 , September 20 , 2018 TMCC1 speciﬁcally regulates ER recruitment to cargo - sorting domains that are labeled with the actin regulatory complex WASH . At these cargo - sorting domains , the retromer pulls cargo into the bud , the retromer recruits the WASH complex , and WASH promotes Arp2 / 3 to nucleate branched actin assembly ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gautreau et al . , 2014 ; Gomez and Billa - deau , 2009 ; Harbour et al . , 2010 ; Jia et al . , 2012 ; Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . Branched Arp2 / 3 actin has been shown to stabilize the bud to give time for cargo sorting before the bud undergoes ﬁssion ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . In the absence of actin , buds still form and undergo ﬁssion , but they are likely to only contain cargo that passively diffuses by bulk ﬂow into the bud , like trans - ferrin receptor ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , we found that buds labeled with the WASH complex ( promotes actin poly - merization at the bud ) required both TMCC1 and Coronin 1C for ﬁssion . An important question is what signals the timing of TMCC1 - dependent ER recruitment to ensure that it is recruited to drive bud ﬁssion only after actin - mediated cargo sequestration has occurred . We would argue that Coronin 1C regulates the timing Figure 5 .

Coronin 1C has previously been shown to label the Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin patches present on endosome buds ( Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . Our data demonstrate that Coronin 1C regulates TMCC1 recruitment , ER MCS formation with the bud , and ER - associated ﬁssion of WASH - labeled buds . Coronins have been shown to regulate actin disassembly by displacing Arp2 / 3 ( Chan et al . , 2012 ; Gandhi et al . , 2009 ; Humphries et al . , 2002 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ) . It would thus function to both disassemble branched actin and recruit TMCC1 / ER for ER - associated ﬁssion ( see model in Figure 7 ) . Work from the De Camilli lab indicates that the efﬁciency of cargo sorting also depends on the interaction of the ER resident protein VAP and two proteins localized to the endosome : OSBP and SNX2 ( Dong et al . , 2016 ) . The interaction between VAP and OSBP is required to downregulate the levels of PI4P on the en - dosome and in turn reduce aberrant actin accumulations . In the absence of VAP or OSBP , PI4P and actin levels increase around the endosome—the outcome of which is a reduction in cargo trafﬁcking ( Dong et al . , 2016 ) . It is not known whether depletion of VAP or OSBP also blocks bud formation or alters Figure 6 .

See also Figure S6 and Video S4 . 262 Cell 175 , 254 – 265 , September 20 , 2018 the rate of ER - associated endosome bud ﬁssion . It will be inter - esting to determine whether VAP - OSBP mediates a reduction in PI4P and actin levels at the bud before or after the process of TMCC1 - dependent ER tubule recruitment . It also remains to be determined what machinery drives bud ﬁssion . One prom - ising candidate is IST1 , which is regulated by an ER localized M1 - Spastin . Spastin does not function to create the ER - endo - some MCS formation ( depleting Spastin actually results in more ER - endosome contact ) , but Spastin regulation of IST1 contributes to the efﬁciency of bud ﬁssion ( Allison et al . , 2013 , 2017 ) . TMCC1 has several interesting properties that could further inform its function that will guide future experiments . TMCC1 has been shown to homo - and hetero - oligomerize with the other TMCC family members ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . TMCC contains pre - dicted coiled coil ( CC ) domains in the N - terminal cytoplasmic domain that are required for function ( Figure S7A ) . We used the structural prediction program Phyre2 to gain further insight into the functional role of the CC domains of TMCC1 . The Phyre2 programs predicts that the two short CCs ( aa 215 – 320 ) are struc - turally similar ( 84 % similarity ) to the Cdc42 binding domain of cip4 ( Figure S7B ) . It is tempting to speculate that the short coiled coils could function to recruit ER tubules to the same position where actin is also nucleated by a RhoGTPase . RhoGTPases are often used as molecular switches , and in this case , a RhoGTPase could provide an additional timer for TMCC1 bind - ing to occur and link the ER to this site when retromer compo - nents have successfully been established . A goal of our future work will be to determine whether a RhoGTPase or Cdc42 itself is involved . TMCC1 also contains a longer predicted CC . The Phyre2 structural prediction program also predicts a high similar - ity ( 98 . 5 % ) between the long CC and a rigid CC found within ﬁbrinogen , a protein that provides structural separation ( Fig - ure S7C ) . We speculate that this long CC would give a predicted length of (cid:1) 18 nm ( an ideal spacing for most MCSs ) ( Alpy et al . , 2013 ; Friedman et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , TMCC1 may form a rigid SNARE - like MCS spacer—perhaps to prevent the two membranes from undergoing heterotypic membrane fusion and / or to establish an important signaling platform that drives and regulates endosome ﬁssion .

Cell growth and plasmid DNA transfections Cos - 7 cells ( ATCC , Manassas , Virginia ) were grown in DMEM media ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Cells were seeded at 2x10 5 cells per well of a 6 - well dish (cid:1) 16 hours prior to transfection . Cells were trans - fected (cid:1) 24hourspriortoimaging withplasmidDNA inOpti - MEMmedia ( Invitrogen ) with5 m lofLipofectamine2000reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After (cid:1) 5 hours of transfection , cells were seeded in 35mm glass - bottom microscope dishes ( MatTek , Ashland , MA ) with 2 . 0x10 5 cells . Live cells were imaged in 37 (cid:3) C Flourobrite supplemented with 10 % FBS . For all microscopy experiments , the following amounts of plasmid DNA were transfected into cells for experiments : 500ng / mL BFP - Sec61 b ; 250ng / mL mCh - Sec61 b and GFP - Sec61 b ; 100ng / mL BFP - KDEL ; 20ng / mL mCh - Rab7 and GFP - Rab7 ; 250ng / mL mCh - FAM21 ; 25ng / mL Coronin1A - GFP ; 25ng / mL Coronin1C - GFP ; 50ng / mL myc - BioID - Rab7 ; 50ng / mL GFP - FAM21 ; 50ng / mL GFP - BioID - FAM21 ; 50ng / mL for low expression of TMCC1 and TMCC2 , 25ng / mL for low expression of TMCC3 ; 166 . 5ng / mL for high expression of TMCC1 and truncation variants . For immunoﬂuorescence experiments , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % Paraformaldhyde , solubilized in 0 . 1 % Triton - X , PBS solution and then immunostained . Streptavidin - 647 was used at 5 m g / mL to visualize biotinylation . Anti - Flag 1 : 1 , 000 ; and all Alexa Fluor conjugated antibodies ( ThermoFisher ) used at 1 : 300 to visualize 3xFlag - TMCC1 . Biotinylation , ER isolation , and biotinylated protein collection HeLa cells ( ATCC - CCL - 2 , Manassas , Virginia ) were grown in complete media ( DMEM ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ) . Cells were seeded in T - 75 ﬂasks with 15 . 0x10 5 cells about (cid:1) 16 hours prior to transfection . Cells were transfected (cid:1) 24 hours prior to biotinylation with plasmid DNA in Opti - MEM media ( Invitrogen ) with 12 . 5 m L of Lipofect - amine 3000 reagent per T - 75 of cells ( Invitrogen ) . After (cid:1) 5 hours of transfection , cells were washed and replenished with complete media and recovered overnight until reaching (cid:1) 90 % – 100 % conﬂuency . Then , cells were incubated in 50 m M biotin for 1 hour . After biotinylation , cells were rinsed and collected using PBS at 37 (cid:3) C . Each cell pellet from 2 , T - 75 ﬂasks was resuspended in 1 mL isola - tion buffer ( 225 mM mannitol , 75 mM sucrose , 30 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA ) at 4 (cid:3) C and lysed using a 1mL dounce homog - enizer with pestle on ice until (cid:1) 90 % – 95 % of cells were lysed as visualized with tryphan blue ( (cid:1) 100 strokes ) . Isolation of the light membrane fraction containing ER occurred as follows : two sequential 600xg spins ( pellet nuclei and cell debris , continue with super - natants ) , three 7 , 000xg spins ( pellet mitochondria , continue with supernatants ) , and then 20 , 000xg spin to pellet light membranes / enrich for ER membranes , collect supernatant as cytosol , add 1 mL isolation buffer - 2 ( 225 mM mannitol , 75 mM sucrose , 30 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 ) to rinse pellet , spin 20 , 000xg again to re - pellet ﬁnal ER light membrane fraction ( all spins occurred at 4 (cid:3) C ) . For each step , pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 200 mM KCl , 5 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , protein levels were normalized by BCA assay , 10 % of sample was diluted in 2X Laemmli sample buffer , and assayed using standard SDS - PAGE / Western Blotting : Rtn3 ( YenZym Antibodies ) 1 : 1000 ; TOM20 1 : 1000 ( sc - 11415 , Santa Cruz Biotechnologies ) ; a - tubulin ( ab18251 , Abcam ) 1 : 10 , 000 ; and Rab7 ( Cell Signaling 99367S , Danvers , MA ) 1 : 500 . The remaining 90 % of ER light membrane frac - tion samples were diluted in 1mL solubilization buffer , nutated for 30min at 4 (cid:3) C , and insoluble proteins were spun down at 15 , 000xg . Solubilized samples were incubated overnight , nutating at 4 (cid:3) C with 90 m L of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 ( Invitrogen ) . Beads e3 Cell 175 , 254 – 265 . e1 – e6 , September 20 , 2018 were washed as according to Roux et al . ( 2012 ) , and replicates were pooled during the ﬁnal wash . Recovered proteins were eluted by boiling the beads at 95 (cid:3) C in 2x Laemmli sample buffer in the presence of 2mM biotin . Methods for BioID proteomics Puriﬁed proteins were precipitated from Laemli sample buffer by adding 100ng / mL insulin ( as a carrier protein ) , 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) Deoxy - cholic acid and 20 % ( w / v ) trichloroacetic acid . Samples were maintained at 4 (cid:3) C throughout the precipitation . Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 21 , 130 x g for 30 minutes . Protein pellets were washed twice with (cid:4) 20 (cid:3) C acetone , air - dried and stored at (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C until further processing . Samples were proteolyzed using the ﬁlter - aided sample preparation ( FASP ) method ( Wi (cid:1) sniewski , 2016 ) . Brieﬂy , dried protein pellets were solubilized in 4 % ( w / v ) SDS , 10mM TCEP , 40mM 2 - chloroacetamide and 0 . 1M Tris pH8 . 5 , then boiled for 5 minutes . Samples were allowed to cool to room temperature for 30 minutes , diluted 10 - fold with 8M Urea , 0 . 1M Tris pH8 . 5 and loaded onto an Amicon Ultra 0 . 5mL 30kD NMWL cutoff ( Millipore ) ultraﬁltration device . Samples were washed in the ﬁlters three time with 8M Urea , 0 . 1M Tris pH8 . 5 , and again three times with 2M Urea , 0 . 1M Tris pH8 . 5 . Endopro - teinase Lys - C ( Wako ) was added and incubated 2 hours rocking at room temperature , followed by trypsin ( Pierce ) which was incu - bated overnight rocking at room temperature . Tryptic peptides were eluted via centrifugation and desalted using a C - 18 spin column ( Pierce ) according to the manufacture instructions . Liquid Chromatography / Mass spectrometry analysis Samples were suspended in 5 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) triﬂuoroacetic acid and direct injected onto a 1 . 7um , 130A˚ C18 , 75um X 250mm M - class column ( Waters ) , with a Waters M - class UPLC . Tryptic peptides were gradient eluted at 300nL / minute , from 3 % acetonitrile to 20 % acetonitrile in 100 minutes , into an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Precursor mass spec - trums ( MS1 ) were acquired at 120 , 000 resolution from 380 - 1500 m / z with an AGC target of 2 . 0E5 and a maximum injection time of 50ms . Dynamic exclusion was set for 20 s with a mass tolerance of ± 10 ppm . Isolation for MS2 scans was 1 . 6Da using the quad - rupole , and the most intense ions were sequenced using Top Speed for a 3 s cycle time . All MS2 sequencing was performed using higher energy collision dissociation ( HCD ) and scanned in the Orbitrap with 30 , 000 resolution . An AGC target of 5 . 0E4 and 60 s maximum injection time was used . Rawﬁles were converted to the mzML format and searched against the Uniprot Human database downloaded April 1 , 2015 using Mascot v2 . 5 with Cysteine Carbamidomethylation as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation . Methionine oxidation , pro - tein N - terminal and Lysine sidechain Biotinylation were searched as variable modiﬁcations . Peptide mass tolerance was 20ppm for MS1 and 20mDa for MS2 . All peptides were thresholded at a 1 % false discovery rate ( FDR ) . RNAi transfection and western blot TMCC1 , FAM21 , VPS35 , and CORO1C were depleted using ON - TARGETplus Human siRNA SMARTpools ( Dharmacon / GE Life - sciences ) . Cells were seeded at 2x10 5 cells per well of a 6 - well dish (cid:1) 16 hours prior to transfection . Cells were ﬁrst transfected (cid:1) 72 hours prior to imaging with 5 m L Dharmafect ( Dharmacon / GE Lifesciences ) in DMEM with 10 % FBS and 25nM of the siRNA SMARTpool or 25nM Silencer Negative Control # 1 siRNA ( Ambion AM4635 ) . After (cid:1) 6 hours of transfection , cells were washed and replenished with DMEM media supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . After (cid:1) 48hrs cells were trans - fected again (cid:1) 24 hours prior to imaging with plasmid DNA as described before with the addition of 12 . 5 nM siRNA SMARTpool or 12 . 5 nM Silencer Negative Control # 1 siRNA . After (cid:1) 5 hours of transfection , cells were seeded in 35mm glass - bottom microscope dishes ( MatTek ) at 2 . 0x10 5 cells . Cells were imaged in 37 (cid:3) Flourobrite supplemented with 10 % FBS . Cos - 7 cells were harvested and TMCC1 , FAM21 , VPS35 , and CORO1C protein levels assayed using standard SDS - PAGE / West - ern protocols . Primary antibody concentrations were used as follows : TMCC1 ( rabbit ) ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) 1 : 1000 ; FAM21 ( rabbit ) 1 : 1000 ( gift from Billadeau ) ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) ; VPS35 ( rabbit ) 1 : 3000 ( Abcam ab97545 ) , and CORO1C ( rabbit ) 1 : 2000 ( Pro - teintech 14749 - 1 - Ap ) ; M6PR 2G11 ( mouse ) ( ThermoFisher Ma 1 - 066 ) , 1 : 1000 ; GAPDH ( rabbit ) 1 : 30 , 000 ( Sigma - Aldrich G9545 , St . Louis , MO ) . Cos - 7 cells and HeLa cells were harvested and TMCC1 - 3 were probed using TMCC1 ( rabbit ) ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) , TMCC2 Ab serum from rabbit injected with TMCC2 aas 442 - 554 antigen and TMCC3 Ab serum from a rabbit injected with full length TMCC3 antigen . HRP - conjugated goat anti – rabbit secondary antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used at 1 : 3000 for all rabbit antibodies HRP - con - jugated goat anti – mouse secondary antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used at 1 : 3000 for all mouse antibodies . Signal was detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Thermo ) . Confocal microscopy Fixed cells were imaged at room temperature . Live cells were kept at 37 (cid:3) C in a live - cell incubation chamber ( Pathology Devices , Westminster , MD ) . Cell imaging was performed with an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope ( TE2000 - U ; Nikon , Melville , NY ) equipped with a Yokogawa spinning - disk confocal system ( CSU - Xm2 ; Nikon ) . Images were taken with a 100 3 NA 1 . 4 oil objective or 60X NA 1 . 4 oil objective ( Nikon ) on electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera 50X50 ( Cascade II ; Photometrics ) , 50x50 ( Andor ) or 1TB ( Andor ) . Images were acquired with MetaMorph 7 . 0 ( MDS Analytical Technologies , Sunnyvale , CA ) , with Nikon Ele - ments , or with Micromanager and then analyzed , merged , and contrasted using Fiji ( ImageJ ) , as well as converted to 400dpi using Photoshop ( Adobe , San Jose , CA ) . Scale bars were generated using Fiji . Supplemental videos were generated using ImageJ , Adobe Photoshop , and Quicktime . Cell 175 , 254 – 265 . e1 – e6 , September 20 , 2018 e4 CI - MPR uptake and trafﬁcking analysis Cells were incubated with 10 m g / ml mouse anti - CI - MPR monoclonal antibody ( ThermoFisher MA1 - 006 ) in serum - free DMEM for 1 hr , rinsed with PBS , ﬁxed with 4 % Paraformaldhyde , solubilized with Triton - X and immunostained with 1 : 500 anti - Giantin ( rabbit ) anti - body ( BioLegend cat 924302 ) and then ﬂuorescent anti - rabbit and anti - mouse antibodies 1 : 300 . Using Fiji , images were background corrected . An area encompassing the whole cell was selected manually and the ﬂuorescence intensity of this region was measured . A 10 3 10 m m 2 region was selected around the Golgi . Vesicular ﬂuorescence was obtained by subtracting the Golgi region ﬂuorescence intensity from whole cell ﬂuorescence . A ratio of Vesicular ﬂuorescence / Golgi ﬂuorescence was calculated for each cell , control and knockdown populations were compared using a two - tailed t test . TMCC1 accumulation at ﬁssion site analysis Cos - 7 cells expressing markers for ER , endosomes , and low expression levels of ER proteins ( TMCC1 , TMCC1 D 1 - 570 , Protrudin , and VAPA ) were visualized live by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy and imaged for 2minute movies with 2 s intervals . Fission events were analyzed if endosomes were in regions of the cell where the ER occupied a single focal plane , the endosome budding domain divided from the vacuolar portion and trafﬁcked away , and the general ER marker labeled ER tubule crossed clearly over the pre ﬁssion bud . The frame just before ﬁssion was then analyzed . Using only the general ER ( Sec61 b ) and endosome ( Rab7 ) channels regions of interest ( ROIs , lines of 5 point thickness ) were drawn along the ER adjacent to the vacuolar part of the endosome ( vacuole contact ROI ) and then drawn along the ER that crossed the endosome bud about to undergo ﬁssion ( bud ﬁssion contact ROI ) . These ROIs were then used to measure TMCC1 , TMCC1 D 1 - 570 , Protrudin , and VAPA ﬂuorescence at the pre ﬁssion frames . The general ER marker ( Sec61 b ) ﬂuorescence intensity was also measured at these ROIs . Fluorescence intensity per area for TMCC1 , TMCC1 D 1 - 570 , Protrudin , and VAPA compared to the general ER marker was calculated for each ROI . The ﬂuorescence intensity per area was also measured for the entire 5micron x 5micron area around the endosome to assess the ﬂuorescence distribution throughout the entire ER . Bud and vacuole enrichment was then quantiﬁed by comparing each ROI ﬂuorescence per area to the 5micron x 5micron area ﬂuorescence per area . Finally , bud enrichment was compared to vacuole enrichment for each event . These ratios were compared for TMCC1 D 1 - 570 versus TMCC1 full length , protrudin , or VAPA using two tailed tests . Percent endosome ﬁssion analysis Cos - 7 cells expressing markers for ER and endosomes were visualized live by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy and imaged for 2 minute movies with 5 s intervals . Endosomes were analyzed if they had a resolvable lumen and were in regions of the cell where the ER occupied a single focal plane . If the endosome formed a budding domain , the endosome diameter and the bud length were measured . Successful ﬁssion was recorded only if the budding domain divided from the vacuolar portion and trafﬁcked away . The percent of buds that underwent ﬁssion was calculated for each cell . Percent ﬁssion was compared in control and knockdown cells using a two - tailed t test . To narrow the analysis to FAM21 primed buds speciﬁcally , each bud was assessed to see if FAM21 signal was present at the bud for two or more consecutive frames in the 2 minute time - lapse . If the bud was FAM21 positive , it was counted into the total number of buds in that cell , and if a FAM21 positive bud underwent ﬁssion , it was counted in the number of buds that underwent ﬁssion in that cell . Each cell’s percent ﬁssion was quantiﬁed under these conditions and percent ﬁssion was compared in control and knockdown cells using a two - tailed t test . ER contact with CORO1C puncta Cos - 7 cells expressing markers for ER , endosome , and CORO1C were visualized live by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy during a 2 minute period , capturing one image every 5 s . CORO1C puncta were assayed if they were localized in the cell periphery where the ER occupies a single focal plane , and they remained spatially and temporally associated with a Rab7 - marked endosomes over the entire course of the 2 minute movie . Each cell was quantiﬁed manually , in every individual frame the acute spatial localization of ER relative to the endosome - associated CORO1C puncta was recorded . Using this information , we calculated the percent of frames within the 2min time course that the ER was spatially overlapping with CORO1C puncta . The percent of time ER crossing Coronin puncta for each bud was averaged per cell , yielding percent of time ER crossing Coronin puncta per cell . Signiﬁcance testing was done using data from control versus TMCC1 KD cells , using a two - tailed t test . ER contact with FAM21 budding domains Similar to ER - CORO1C association , ER - FAM21 association was assessed in Cos - 7 cells using confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy 2 minute time - lapses , capturing one image every 5 s in Cos - 7 cells expressed markers for ER , endosome , and FAM21 . FAM21 labeled buds were assayed if they were localized in the cell periphery where the ER occupies a single focal plane , and the FAM21 remained spatially and temporally associated with the Rab7 marked endosome over at least 1 min of the movie . Each cell was quan - tiﬁed manually ; in every individual frame the acute spatial localization of ER relative to the FAM21 bud was recorded . Using this in - formation , we calculated the percent of frames the ER was spatially overlapping with the FAM21 bud . The percent of time ER crossing the FAM21 bud for each bud was averaged per cell , yielding percent time ER crossing the FAM21 bud per cell . Signiﬁcance testing was done using data from control versus KD cells , using a two - tailed t test . e5 Cell 175 , 254 – 265 . e1 – e6 , September 20 , 2018 Amino acid sequence analysis with structure prediction software Two regions of TMCC1 protein sequence were analyzed using Phyre2 prediction software .
