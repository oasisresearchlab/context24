Vol . 216 No . 11 3785 – 3798 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201701176 Introduction Cell migration and cell spreading are multistep processes in - volving protrusion of the plasma membrane , induction of new adhesions to the underlying substratum , and maturation and turnover of adhesion sites ( Petrie et al . , 2009 ; Devreotes and Horwitz , 2015 ) . The different processes critically rely on the coordinated and dynamic regulation of integrin - mediated adhe - sions and actin structures , e . g . , the formation of nascent adhe - sions ( NAs ) and branched actin networks in lamellipodia , and the assembly of stress fibers that connect focal adhesions ( FAs ) further toward the middle and rear of spread cells . Lamellipo - dia are smooth and narrow projections of the plasma membrane that extend along the cell edges and are initiated by the actin nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . The canonical Arp2 / 3 complex consists of seven sub - units ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ; Bugyi and Carlier , 2010 ) , binds to the sides of already existing actin filaments , and triggers the growth of new actin branches . The actin nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex is induced by members of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome pro - tein family , including WASP and WAVE ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ; Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) , whose activity in turn is controlled by small Rho - like GTPases , including Rac1 and Cdc42 ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . The physical coupling of the branched actin network to the ECM occurring in lamellipodia and membrane protrusions of isotropically spreading cells is achieved by integrin - mediated adhesions that initially form as small , short - lived NAs at or near the edge of protruding membranes . Once formed , they either disassemble or mature in an actomyosin - dependent manner into large and long - lived FAs ( Vicente - Manzanares and Horwitz , 2011 ) . The induction of integrin - mediated adhesions requires an integrin - activation step characterized by the conformational shift of the unbound , low - affinity ( inactive ) state to the bound , high - affinity ( active ) state , which is followed by integrin clus - tering to stabilize integrin – ligand complexes and the assembly of a large multiprotein network that enables signaling . The two cytosolic adaptor proteins talin and kindlin bind to β integrin cytoplasmic domains and induce and / or maintain integrin - mediated cell – extracellular matrix adhesion . The prevalent view is that talin and kindlin cooperate to induce integrin acti - vation ( Han et al . , 2006 ; Moser et al . , 2008 ; Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) and clustering ( Cluzel et al . , 2005 ; Ye et al . , 2013 ) . An additional function of kindlin is to induce membrane protru - sions during early , isotropic cell spreading by directly binding Cell spreading requires the coupling of actin - driven membrane protrusion and integrin - mediated adhesion to the extra - cellular matrix . The integrin - activating adaptor protein kindlin - 2 plays a central role for cell adhesion and membrane protrusion by directly binding and recruiting paxillin to nascent adhesions . Here , we report that kindlin - 2 has a dual role during initial cell spreading : it binds paxillin via the pleckstrin homology and F0 domains to activate Rac1 , and it directly associates with the Arp2 / 3 complex to induce Rac1 - mediated membrane protrusions . Consistently , abrogation of kindlin - 2 binding to Arp2 / 3 impairs lamellipodia formation and cell spreading . Our findings identify kindlin - 2 as a key protein that couples cell adhesion by activating integrins and the induction of membrane protrusions by activating Rac1 and supplying Rac1 with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Kindlin - 2 recruits paxillin and Arp2 / 3 to promote membrane protrusions during initial cell spreading Ralph T .

JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 11 • 2017 3786 and recruiting paxillin to NAs , which in turn leads to FAK and Rac1 activation ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) . Arp2 / 3 – driven membrane protrusion and integrin - me - diated adhesion to the ECM in NAs are tightly coupled and depend on each other . It has been shown that Arp2 / 3 can be recruited to adhesion sites through transient interactions with vinculin ( DeMali et al . , 2002 ; Chorev et al . , 2014 ) and FAK ( Serrels et al . , 2007 ; Swaminathan et al . , 2016 ) . Talin is unable to induce circumferential membrane pro - trusions during isotropic spreading in the absence of kindlin - 2 ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) . Because kindlin - 2 recruits paxillin and FAK , which in turn was shown to induce Rac1 activation and membrane protrusion , we hypothesized that by circum - venting the Rac1 activation defect in kindlin - deficient cells , cell spreading should efficiently be induced . In this study , we tested this hypothesis and further characterized the kindlin - 2 – paxillin complex using cross - linking proteomics . The findings of our studies are discussed here . Results Kindlin - 2 directly binds paxillin through the PH and F0 domains In a previous study , we reported a direct , Zn 2 + - dependent in - teraction between the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of kindlin - 2 and the Lin - 11 , Isl - 1 , and Mec - 3 ( LIM3 ) domain of paxillin by size - exclusion chromatography and pull - down ex - periments ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , we found that the absence of the PH domain in kindlin - 2 leads to low levels of paxillin in NAs but to normal levels in mature FAs of fibroblasts ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) , indicating that paxillin recruitment to FAs occurs either in a kindlin - independent man - ner or through additional , unrecognized paxillin - binding sites in kindlin . To test the latter possibility , we performed cross - linking mass spectrometry ( XL - MS ) experiments of recombinant kindlin - 2 – paxillin complexes by cross - linking the amine groups of lysine side chains with an isotopically coded bis - sulfosuccinimidyl suberate ( Leitner et al . , 2010 ) . Cross - linked peptides were identified by tandem mass spectrometry ( MS ) and used to assemble a map of the inter - and intraprotein cross - links of the kindlin - 2 – paxillin complex ( Figs . 1 A and S1 A and Supplemental dataset ) . We identified cross - links between the N - terminal LD motifs of paxillin and the PH domain of kindlin - 2 . In addition , we also observed multiple cross - links between the F0 domain of kindlin - 2 and the LIM3 / 4 domains and the LD motifs of paxillin , suggesting that the PH as well as the F0 domains contribute to kindlin - 2 binding to paxillin . We verified the XL - MS results by analytical ultracentrif - ugation , in which fluorescent labeling of one of the two inter - action partners was used at a time to detect the corresponding absorption wavelengths . The in vitro reconstituted kindlin - 2 – paxillin complex sedimented at 4 . 3 S , whereas recombinant kindlin - 2 lacking the F0 and PH domains failed to form a de - tectable complex with paxillin ( Fig . 1 B ) . Recombinant F0 and PH domains and a hybrid F0 – PH domain of kindlin - 2 were able to bind paxillin ( Fig . 1 C ) . Interestingly , the sedimenta - tion coefficients of paxillin associated with the F0 or PH do - main of kindlin - 2 were lower than the sedimentation coefficient of paxillin alone , indicating that the impact of the weight in - crease on the sedimentation coefficient is compensated by an induced compaction of paxillin upon complex formation with either the F0 or PH domain . Next , we performed affinity measurements using iso - thermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) . The affinity of paxillin for full - length kindlin - 2 was 205 ± 59 nM , whereas the affinities of paxillin to the F0 or the PH domain alone were lower and ranged between 1 , 920 ± 628 and 1 , 080 ± 320 nM , respectively ( Fig . 1 , D – F ) . Addition of EDTA abolished the interactions with paxillin , indicating that not only binding of full - length kindlin - 2 but also binding of the isolated F0 or PH domain is Zn 2 + ion dependent ( Fig . S1 , B – D ) . Altogether , these data point to the existence of a second , previously unnoticed paxillin - binding domain in kindlin - 2 and suggest that both domains bind con - currently to increase the affinity of kindlin - 2 to paxillin . The kindlin - 2 PH and F0 domains are required for cell adhesion and spreading To characterize kindlin - 2 – paxillin binding in cells , we isolated , immortalized and cloned kidney fibroblasts from mice carrying floxed kindlin - 1 ( Fermt1 flox / flox ) , kindlin - 2 ( Fermt2 flox / flox ) , Tln1 alleles , and nullizygous Tln2 alleles ( Flox cells ; Fig . 2 A ) . To directly compare kindlin - 2 and talin - 1 functions in the same cel - lular background , the floxed alleles were deleted by adenoviral expression of Cre recombinase , resulting in kindlin - 1 , kindlin - 2 , talin - 1 , and talin - 2 – deficient ( quadruple knockout [ qKO ] ) cells , and reconstituted with C - terminally mCherry - tagged talin - 1 ( T1 - mCherry ) , N - terminally EGFP - tagged kindlin - 2 ( EGFP - K2 ) , or a combination of both ( T1 - mCherry + EGFP - K2 ) . Cre treatment deleted the floxed Tln1 and floxed Fermt1 / 2 genes ( Fig . 2 B ) , resulted in cell rounding ( Fig . 2 C ) , and abol - ished adhesion of the resulting qKO cells to fibronectin ( FN ) and vitronectin ( VN ; Fig . 2 , D and E ) . Reexpression of T1 - mCherry or EGFP - K2 did not rescue the severe adhesion defects of qKO cells when plated on FN or VN , whereas coexpression of T1 - mCherry together with EGFP - K2 rescued cell adhesion and spreading ( Fig . 2 , B – E ) . Importantly , loss of endogenous talin and / or kindlin as well as reexpression of T1 - mCherry and / or EGFP - K2 did not change surface levels of the FN - binding integrins α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 . In fact , α 5 , α v and β 3 levels were in - creased in qKO and single reconstituted cells ( Fig . 2 F ) . Next , we expressed either EGFP - K2 or EGFP - tagged kindlin - 2 truncation mutants that lacked either the F0 ( EGFP - K2 Δ F0 ) or the PH domain ( EGFP - K2 Δ PH ) or both domains ( EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH ) in T1 - mCherry cells ( Fig . 3 A ) and per - formed coimmunoprecipitation ( co - IP ) assays . The experiments revealed that paxillin coprecipitated EGFP - K2 , whereas the co - IP of EGFP - K2 Δ F0 or EGFP - K2 Δ PH were reduced and of the K2 Δ F0 Δ PH abolished ( Fig . 3 B ) , confirming that both the F0 and PH domains of kindlin - 2 contribute to paxillin binding . In line with our previous finding ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) , qKO cells expressing either T1 - mCherry or EGFP - K2 failed to adhere to FN ( Fig . 2 D ) . Reexpression of EGFP - K2 in T1 - mCherry expressing cells fully rescued adhesion to FN , whereas reexpression of EGFP - K2 Δ F0 or EGFP - K2 Δ PH only partially rescued adhesion and reexpression of EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH almost completely abolished cell adhesion and spreading ( Fig . 3 , C and D , gray bars without Mn 2 + ) . Further - more , EGFP - K2 , EGFP - K2 Δ F0 , and EGFP - K2 Δ PH localized to FAs in kindlin - 2 – deficient T1 - mCherry cells , whereas the few adhering EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH expressing T1 - mCherry cells remained round and failed to form discernable FAs ( Fig . S2 ) . Dual role of kindlin - 2 during cell spreading • Böttcher et al . 3787 To bypass integrin activation , we treated cells with Mn 2 + , which binds to the integrin ectodomain and induces the con - formational changes of activated integrins ( Mould et al . , 1995 ) . The experiments revealed that expression of EGFP - K2 Δ F0 and EGFP - K2 Δ PH almost completely rescued adhe - sion of T1 - mCherry – expressing cells to FN . In contrast , EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH expression only slightly increased adhesion in the presence of Mn 2 + ( Fig . 3 D ) . To test whether the EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH expressing cells also exhibit defects in integrin outside - in signaling , we an - alyzed spreading of cells seeded for 30 min on FN in the presence or absence of Mn 2 + . In the absence of Mn 2 + , T1 - mCherry cells expressing EGFP - K2 Δ F0 or EGFP - K2 Δ PH spread less compared with T1 - mCherry cells expressing EGFP - K2 ( Fig . 3 E ) . Expression of EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH in T1 - mCherry cells increased the spreading area much less ef - ficiently than expression of EGFP - K2 Δ F0 or EGFP - K2 Δ PH in T1 - mCherry ( Fig . 3 E ) . Altogether , these findings indicate that the absence of either the F0 or PH domain of kindlin - 2 impairs cell spreading , whereas the lack of both domains further curbs spreading . Active Rac1 requires kindlin - 2 to induce cell spreading We previously reported that expression of kindlin - 2 , but not talin - 1 , enables isotropic cell spreading in the presence of Mn 2 + and serum ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) . Our findings so far re - vealed that binding of the F0 and PH domains of kindlin - 2 to paxillin is required for normal adhesion and spreading of T1 - mCherry – expressing cells . Moreover , the absence of F0 and PH domains in kindlin - 2 abrogated activation of FAK ( Fig . 4 A ) , which in turn assembles the FAK – Src – p130Cas – Dock180 complex to induce Rac1 - mediated cell spreading ( Schlaepfer et al . , 2004 ; Brami - Cherrier et al . , 2014 ; Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . In line with this finding , the levels of active , GTP - bound Rac1 did not increase in Mn 2 + - treated T1 - mCherry cells adhering to FN and expressing EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH ( Fig . 4 B ) . Next , we tested whether a constitutively active myc - tagged Rac1 Q61L is able to induce spreading of T1 - mCherry or K2 - EGFP cells . To this end , we retrovirally transduced the cells with Rac1 Q61L ( Fig . 4 C ) and seeded them on FN with - out serum or growth factors and in the presence or absence of Mn 2 + . In the absence of Mn 2 + , the sporadic and very weakly Figure 1 . Cross - linking identifies two distinct kindlin - 2 – paxillin interaction sites .

( H ) Immunofluorescence images of talin KO and kindlin KO cells transduced with myc - Rac1 Q61L and allowed to Dual role of kindlin - 2 during cell spreading • Böttcher et al . 3791 adherent EGFP - K2 cells remained small and lacked membrane protrusions , whereas Mn 2 + treatment improved cell adhesion and induced circumferential membrane protrusions , which further increased upon expression of Rac1 Q61L ( Fig . 4 , D – F ) . Interest - ingly , T1 - mCherry – expressing cells failed to form large mem - brane protrusions on FN and upon expression of Rac1 Q61L , irrespective of whether Mn 2 + was absent or present in the culture medium ( Fig . 4 , D – F ) , whereas integrin - independent spread - ing on poly - l - lysine ( PLL ) was not affected by the absence of kindlin - 2 ( Fig . 4 G ) . Importantly , similar results were obtained upon expression of Rac1 Q61L in our previously published talin knockout ( KO ) cells that express kindlin - 2 and kindlin KO cells that express talin - 1 ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) , excluding clonal effects as cause for the absent membrane protrusions in cells co - expressing talin and Rac Q61L ( Fig . 4 , H and I ) . Altogether these findings suggest that kindlin - 2 , aside from operating upstream of Rac1 , also provides an additional function to initiate Rac1 - induced membrane protrusions , which is lacking in talin - 1 – expressing T1 - mCherry cells . Kindlin - 2 associates with the Arp2 / 3 complex Because kindlin - 2 , but not talin - 1 , was able to induce stable membrane protrusions upon expression of Rac1 Q61L , we hy - pothesized that kindlin - 2 harbors an additional functional fea - ture that operates in parallel to the activation of FAK / Rac1 . To identify new functional properties of kindlin - 2 , we screened for novel interaction partners by immunoprecipitation of GFP - tagged kindlin - 2 followed by MS . Among proteins that were precipitated with kindlin - 2 were subunits of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Fig . 5 A ) , which triggers the circumferential membrane protrusion with the characteristic smooth rim during early cell spreading ( Suraneni et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) . Although Western blots revealed similar levels of Arp2 / 3 and Arp2 / 3 – activating WAVE2 protein in EGFP - K2 and T1 - mCherry cells ( Fig . 5 B ) , chemical inhibition of Arp2 / 3 ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) strongly reduced the formation of lamellipodial protrusions in Mn 2 + - treated EGFP - K2 cells ( Fig . S3 A ) , highlighting the crucial role of Arp2 / 3 for kindlin - 2 – mediated formation of membrane protrusions . Hence , we decided to further analyze the relation - ship of the two proteins . Consistent with the proteomic data , in vitro pull - down assays revealed that recombinant His - tagged kindlin - 2 ( His - K2 ) bound the purified Arp2 / 3 protein complex ( Fig . 5 C ) . Fur - thermore , GFP - K2 coimmunoprecipitated the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 5 D ) , and conversely , Arp2 / 3 complex members were able to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous kindlin - 2 ( Fig . 5 E ) . Fi - nally , kindlin - 2 colocalized with the Arp2 / 3 complex and the WAVE complex component Abi1 in membrane protrusions of spreading cells , but not in FAs ( Fig . 5 , F and G ) . Next , we determined the kinetics of the interaction be - tween kindlin - 2 and the Arp2 / 3 complex before and after plat - ing T1 - mCherry + EGFP - K2 – expressing cells on FN . The co - IP experiments revealed that the interaction of kindlin - 2 with Arp3 was highest in suspended , nonadherent cells and in the first 5 min after seeding and sharply decreased ∼ 10 min after seeding ( Fig . 5 H ) . Interestingly , neither vinculin nor FAK coimmunoprecipitated with kindlin in suspended and early spreading cells ( Fig . 5 H ) . Furthermore , the association of kindlin - 2 and Arp2 / 3 remained unaffected in vinculin - deficient and FAK - depleted cells ( Fig . S3 , B and C ) , which altogether suggests that kindlin - 2 – Arp2 / 3 complexes exist independently of vinculin – Arp2 / 3 ( DeMali et al . , 2002 ; Chorev et al . , 2014 ) and FAK – Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Serrels et al . , 2007 ; Swaminathan et al . , 2016 ) to induce membrane protrusions from newly assem - bled adhesion sites at the periphery of the plasma membrane . The integrity of the Arp2 / 3 – kindlin - 2 complex is required for cell spreading The interaction between FAK and Arp2 / 3 is mediated by lysine - 38 and arginine - 86 located in the F1 subdomain of the four - point - one , ezrin , radixin , moesin ( FERM ) domain of FAK and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Serrels et al . , 2007 ) . We also observed that the F1 subdomain of kindlin - 2 was required to efficiently coimmunoprecipitate Arp3 ( Fig . 6 A ) . A superposition of the FAK FERM F1 domain and a model of the mouse kindlin - 2 F1 domain suggested that arginine - 100 and leucine - 141 of kindlin - 2 occupy the positions of lysine - 38 and arginine - 86 in FAK ( Fig . 6 B ) . To test this hypothesis , we generated qKO cells stably expressing T1 - mCherry and an EGFP - tagged kindlin - 2 , in which arginine - 100 and leucine - 141 were substituted with alanine residues ( EGFP - K2 RL / AA ) . Although EGFP - K2 RL / AA localized to talin - 1 – containing adhesion structures and al - lowed cell adhesion ( Fig . 6 C ) , EGFP - K2 RL / AA coimmuno - precipitated less Arp3 than EGFP - K2 ( Fig . 6 D ) . A time course analysis of cell spreading showed that 30 min after cell seeding , only approximately half of EGFP - K2 RL / AA – expressing cells were spread ( Fig . 6 , E and F ; and Fig . S4 , A and B ) , and only 22 % formed ArpC5A - positive , pro - trusive membranes ( 22 % ± 5 % , n = 162 ) compared with 80 % spread EGFP - K2 expressing cells , of which 70 % displayed ArpC5A - positive membrane protrusions ( 70 % ± 4 % , n = 93 ; Fig . 6 , F and G ) . A similar spreading defect was observed upon expression of EGFP - K2 RL / AA in an independent kindlin KO cell line ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) , although the differences were less pronounced ( Fig . 6 H ) . Altogether , these findings in - dicate that the Arp2 / 3 – kindlin - 2 complex promotes the produc - tion of protrusive membranes during early cell spreading and lamellipodia formation . Discussion In the present study , we report two major findings . First , we identified a previously unrecognized interaction between the kindlin - 2 F0 domain and the LIM3 / 4 domains as well as the LD motifs of paxillin using cross - linking proteomics . A dele - tion mutant of kindlin - 2 lacking the F0 and PH domain failed to bind paxillin and localize to adhesion sites , suggesting that both sites contribute to paxillin binding and integrin - ligand binding , possibly through the recruitment of proteins to the kindlin - 2 – paxillin complex . Second , we observed that constitutively active Rac1 ( Rac1 Q61L ) induced isotropic spreading with circumferential spread for 20 min on FN in the presence of 5 mM Mn 2 + . Cells were stained with an antibody against β 1 integrin . DAPI was used to stain nuclei . Bar , 20 µm .

MS - based interactome screening revealed that kindlin - 2 associates with the Arp2 / 3 complex , and coimmunostaining revealed colocal - ization of the two proteins in the smooth rim of the protruding membrane . The accumulation of a functional Arp2 / 3 complex at the periphery of spreading cells requires a direct association of kindlin - 2 with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Consistently , disruption of this interaction by introducing point mutations into the F1 subdomain of kindlin - 2 caused impaired membrane protrusion . The kindlin - 2 structure ( Kammerer et al . , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2017 ) supports the model in which arginine - 100 and leucine - 141 of kindlin - 2 occupy the positions of lysine - 38 and arginine - 86 in FAK with respect to Arp2 / 3 binding . Of note , however , the ex - perimental structure indicates that leucine - 141 in kindlin - 2 is partly masked by a flexible loop within the kindlin - 2 F1 mod - ule that locates into a groove between the F1 and F3 modules . It is therefore possible that although the K2 RL / AA substi - tutions do not diminish binding to β 1 integrin tails and ILK , Figure 5 . Kindlin - 2 binds and recruits the Arp2 / 3 complex to NAs .

Dual role of kindlin - 2 during cell spreading • Böttcher et al . 3793 they may destabilize the structure of the Arp2 / 3 interaction site and hence contribute to the decreased Arp2 / 3 binding ob - served in our experiments . The kinetic interaction studies suggest that kindlin - 2 – Arp2 / 3 complexes are preassembled in the cytoplasm and recruited to nascent integrin adhesion sites where the kindlin - 2 – paxillin complex induces Rac1 - WAVE – mediated activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and the formation of smooth membrane protrusions . Although Arp2 / 3 levels were unchanged in T1 - mCherry cells and Arp2 / 3 was previously shown to associate with vinculin and FAK ( DeMali et al . , 2002 ; Serrels et al . , 2007 ; Chorev et al . , 2014 ; Swaminathan et al . , 2016 ) , which both bind talin , the expression of Rac1 Q61L in T1 - mCherry – expressing cells was not sufficient to induce cell spreading and Arp2 / 3 – mediated formation of lamellipodia . It is therefore possible that talin - 1 requires a signal ( e . g . , from kindlin - 2 or kindlin - 2 – bound paxillin ) to become functionalized and con - tribute to cell spreading with Arp2 / 3 bound to vinculin or FAK . Clearly , the cross talk between kindlin - 2 and talin - 1 during ad - hesion and initial spreading requires further cell biological and biochemical investigations . It is conceivable that kindlin - 2 contributes to cell spread - ing with additional signals or properties . Such a function of kindlin - 2 could be clustering of active Rac1 GTPases at the plasma membrane . Phagocytosis was shown to require local - ized actin polymerization and membrane remodeling , which Figure 6 . Lamellipodia formation and cell spreading requires kindlin - 2 binding to Arp2 / 3 .

JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 11 • 2017 3794 critically depends on Rac1 activation and Rac1 recruitment to and clustering at the plasma membrane ( Castellano et al . , 2000 ) . Kindlin - 3 has recently been shown to induce clustering of ligand - occupied integrins ( Ye et al . , 2013 ) . If this function is conserved among all kindlins , then kindlin - 2 may aggregate Rac1 , helping Rac1 to exceed a threshold required for inducing lamellipodia - driven cell spreading . In summary , our findings suggest that the preassembled kindlin - 2 – Arp2 / 3 complex is recruited to early adhesion sites in the cell periphery to induce initial cell spreading . As soon as the task is accomplished , other FA proteins , including FAK and vinculin , control Arp2 / 3 activity . It is possible that each FA pro - tein assembles a specific Arp2 / 3 complex equipped with spe - cific properties ( Chorev et al . , 2014 ; Abella et al . , 2016 ) that are determined by subunit isoform compositions and / or additional proteins present in the different complexes ( Serrels et al . , 2007 ; Chorev et al . , 2014 ; Abella et al . , 2016 ; Swaminathan et al . , 2016 ) . Future studies are required to define whether kindlin - 2 associates with the canonical Arp2 / 3 complex or whether kindlin - 2 assembles a specific Arp2 / 3 complex that initiates but does not complete cell spreading . Materials and methods Mouse strains and cell lines The floxed kindlin - 1 ( Fermt1 flox / flox ) , kindlin - 2 ( Fermt2 flox / flox ) , and talin - 1 ( Tln1 flox / flox ) mouse strains and the constitutive talin - 2 – null ( Tln2 − / − ) mouse strain ( Nieswandt et al . , 2007 ; Conti et al . , 2009 ; Rognoni et al . , 2014 ; Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) were intercrossed to isolate kidney fibro - blasts from 21 - d - old mice . Cells were immortalized by retroviral trans - duction of the SV40 large T antigen and then cloned ( Flox cells ) . To obtain cells lacking talin - 1 and talin - 2 as well as kindlin - 1 and kindlin - 2 ( qKO cells ) the parental Flox cells with similar integrin surface profiles were adenovirally transduced with Cre . To generate talin and kindlin rescue cell lines , the qKO cells were retrovirally transduced with cDNAs coding for mCherry - tagged talin - 1 ( T1 - mCherry ) and EGFP - tagged full - length kindlin - 2 ( EGFP - K2 ) or EGFP - tagged kindlin - 2 truncation mutants that lacked the F0 domain ( EGFP - K2 Δ F0 ) , PH domain ( EGFP - K2 Δ PH ) , or both domains ( EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH ) . Fibroblasts lacking either ta - lins ( talin KO ) or kindlins ( kindlin KO ) and myc - kindlin - 2 ( myc - K2 ) – reexpressing cells have been described previously ( Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) . Vinculin flox ( Vinc fl / fl ) and vinculin - deficient ( Vinc − / − ) fibroblasts were a gift from C . Grashoff ( Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , Martinsried , Germany ; Austen et al . , 2015 ) . For stably depleting FAK expression , qKO cells were retrovirally transduced with shRNA target sequences against mouse FAK ( 5 ′ - GTC CAA CTA TGA AGT ATTA - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GGT CCA ATG ACA AGG TATA - 3 ′ ) . All cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS and penicillin / streptomycin . Transient and stable transfection / transduction To generate stable cell lines , vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotyped retroviral vectors were produced by transient transfection of 293T ( human embryonic kidney ) cells . 48 and 72 h after transfection of the viral packaging plasmids , viral particles were harvested by collecting the cell culture medium . After filtering the collected medium through 0 . 45 - µm filters , viral particles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 20 , 300 rpm for 2 h with a SW 32 Ti rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) and resus - pended in 45 µl cold Hank’s balanced salt solution ( 14175046 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) per 15 - cm dish . Cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Flow cytometry Flow cytometry was performed with a FAC SCanto TMII cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) equipped with FACS DiVa software ( BD Biosci - ences ) . Fibroblasts were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS + 1 % BSA for 1 h on ice and washed with cold PBS + 1 % BSA before incubation with the secondary antibody for 45 min on ice . Data analysis was performed with the FlowJo program ( version 9 . 4 . 10 ) .

Phalloidin – Alexa Fluor 647 ( A22287 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and DAPI ( Sigma ) were used to stain F - actin and nuclei , respectively . The Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitors CK - 666 ( SML0006 ; Sigma ) and CK - 869 ( C9125 ; Sigma ) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 50 mg / ml . Plasmids , constructs , and expression and purification of recombinant proteins Mouse kindlin - 2 complementary DNAs ( full length : amino acids 1 – 680 , K2 Δ F0 : deletion of amino acids 1 – 91 , K2 Δ F1 : deletion of amino acids 96 – 272 , K2 Δ F2 : deletion of amino acids 271 – 559 , K2 Δ F3 : deletion of amino acids 571 – 680 , K2 Δ PH : deletion of amino acids 381 – 476 , K2 Δ F0 Δ PH : deletions of amino acids 1 – 91 and 381 – 476 , and K2 RL / AA , in which R100 and L141 were substituted with alanine ) were cloned into pEGFP - C1 vector ( Clontech ) using XhoI and BamHI sites . For retrovirus - mediated expression , cDNAs of EGFP - K2 , EGFP - K2 Δ F0 , EGFP - K2 Δ F1 , EGFP - K2 Δ F2 , EGFP - K2 Δ F3 , EGFP - K2 Δ PH , EGFP - K2 Δ F0 Δ PH , and EGFP - K2 RL / AA were inserted be - tween NheI and BamHI sites of the pRetroQ - AcGFP - C1 ( Clontech ) vector . Stable expression of myc - Kindlin2 cDNA was achieved with Dual role of kindlin - 2 during cell spreading • Böttcher et al . 3795 the sleeping beauty transposase system using ITR - Puro ( + ) plasmid containing the mouse kindlin - 2 cDNA . Myc - tagged Rac1 Q61L was cloned into the retroviral vector pCLM FG to generate stable cell lines . EGFP - tagged variants of Abi1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex subunit ArpC5B were as described previously ( Lai et al . , 2008 ) . Constructs of murine paxillin ( full length : amino acids 1 – 557 ) and kindlin - 2 ( full length : amino acids 1 – 680 , K2 F0 : amino acids 1 – 97 , K2 PH : amino acids 386 – 496 , K2 Δ PH : deletion of amino acids 372 – 500 , K2 Δ F0 Δ PH : de - letions of amino acids 1 – 97 and 372 – 500 and K2 F0 - PH : amino acids 1 – 97 and 386 – 496 fused by a flexible linker [ SGG GGT SGG GG ] ) were cloned into the AgeI – XhoI site of pCoofy17 ( Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry core facility ) , yielding proteins N - terminally tagged with a 10× histidine tag followed by a SUMO3 tag . Production of recombi - nant proteins in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells ( Millipore ) was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0 . 2 mM at 18°C for 24 h . After cell lysis and clarification of the supernatant , the proteins were purified by Ni - NTA affinity chromatography ( Qiagen ) . Eluate fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled , cleaved with SenP2 protease , and subsequently purified by size exclusion chroma - tography ( Superdex 200 16 / 60 ; GE Healthcare ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex was affinity purified from pig brain as described previously ( Block et al . , 2012 ) . In brief , the brain was ho - mogenized with a blender in the presence of a fivefold excess ( vol / vol ) of ice - cold extraction buffer containing 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 25 mM KCl , 2 mM DTT , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 1 mM ATP and the homogenate centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 45 min . The cleared supernatant was loaded on a GST - WAVE1 - VCA ( amino acids 492 – 559 ) glutathione Sepharose column , and after extensive washing of the column with extraction buffer , the remaining non – Arp2 / 3 pro - teins were eluted by 0 . 2 M KCl in extraction buffer . The Arp2 / 3 com - plex was subsequently eluted with 0 . 2 M MgCl 2 in extraction buffer and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using an Äkta Purifier System equipped with a HiLoad 26 / 600 Superdex 200 col - umn ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with elution buffer . Fractions con - taining the Arp2 / 3 complex were pooled , dialyzed against a storage buffer ( 150 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 55 % glycerol , and 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 ) , and stored at − 20°C . Chemical cross - linking and MS of the kindlin - 2 – paxillin complex The kindlin - 2 – paxillin complex was purified on a size exclusion col - umn ( SEC650 ; Bio - Rad ) equilibrated with XL buffer ( 25 mM Hepes , pH 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , 1 mM tris [ 2 - carboxyethyl ] phosphine [ TCEP ] , and 10 µM ZnCl 2 ) . The used fraction showed a 1 : 1 stoichiometry of kindlin - 2 and paxillin and a concen - tration of 60 µg / ml . This solution was supplemented with 10 µM of isotopically light ( d0 ) – and heavy ( d12 ) – labeled bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate cross - linker ( Creative Molecules Inc . ) and allowed to react on ice for 18 h before stopping the cross - linking reaction with 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate . Cross - linked proteins were enzymatically digested , and cross - linked peptides were identified by tandem MS as reported previously ( Herzog et al . , 2012 ) . In brief , cross - linked pro - teins were denatured by adding two sample volumes of 8 M urea and reduced by incubating with 5 mM TCEP ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 35°C for 15 min . Proteins were alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 35 min at RT in the dark . Proteins were proteolyt - ically digested by adding lysyl endopeptidase ( 1 / 50 [ wt / wt ] ; Wako ) for 2 h at 35°C followed by the addition of trypsin ( 1 / 50 [ wt / wt ] ; Promega ) overnight at a final concentration of 1 M urea . Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 1 % ( vol / vol ) trifluoroacetic acid . Acidified peptides were purified by reversed - phase chromatography on C18 columns ( Sep - Pak , Waters ) . Eluates were dried and reconstituted in 20 µl of mo - bile phase ( water / acetonitrile / trifluoroacetic acid , 75 : 25 : 0 . 1 ) and cross - linked peptides were enriched on a Superdex Peptide PC 3 . 2 / 30 column ( GE Healthcare ) at a flow rate of 25 µl / min . Fractions of the cross - linked peptides were dried and reconstituted in 20 µl 2 % acetonitrile and 0 . 2 % formic acid and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS using a LTQ Orbitrap Elite ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) instrument . The cross - link fragment ion spectra were searched and the peptides identified by the open - source software xQuest ( Walzthoeni et al . , 2012 ) . False discovery rates calculated by xProphet were ≤ 0 . 05 , and results were filtered according to the following parameters : delta score ≤ 0 . 85 , MS1 tolerance window of − 4 to 4 ppm , and score > 22 . Analytical ultracentrifugation To qualitatively determine the binding of different kindlin - 2 constructs to paxillin , the proteins of interest were labeled using Atto520 - NHS - ester ( ATT OTec ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The measurements were conducted using an analytical Optima XL - I cen - trifuge ( Beckman - Coulter ) at 14°C and 50 , 000 rpm / 201 , 600 g , and sedimentation data were recorded at the wavelength of maximum absorption of the dye . The data were analyzed using SedFit ( Schuck , 2000 ) in continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution mode . ITC Quantitative ITC measurements were conducted using a PeaqITC in - strument ( Malvern ) at a constant jacket temperature of 14°C . Proteins were rebuffered in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP , and 10 µM ZnCl 2 . 12 × 3 µl of the respective kindlin - 2 construct was in - jected into the measurement cell containing paxillin . To show the Zn 2 + dependence of the interaction , 5 mM EDTA was added to the sample cell . All data were analyzed using MicroCal PeaqITC Analysis software . Modeling of the kindlin - 2 F1 structure A kindlin - 2 structural model was generated by I - tasser ( Roy et al . , 2010 ) using the talin - head FERM domain ( Protein Data Bank [ PDB ] : 3IVF ; Elliott et al . , 2010 ) as search model . A version of the kindlin - 2 F1 domain structure obtained by this approach was aligned to a struc - ture of avian FAK ( PDB : 4CYE ) using PyMol ( Molecular Graphics System , Version 1 . 6 ; Schrodinger , LLC ) . The obtained structural root mean square deviations were 2 . 259 Å for one molecule in the asym - metric unit and 2 . 106 Å for the second molecule in the asymmetric unit of 4CYE , respectively . Immunostaining For immunostaining , cells were cultured on plastic ibidi µ - Slides ( 80826 ) or glass coverslips coated with 10 µg / ml FN ( Calbiochem ) . Cells were routinely fixed with 4 % PFA ( wt / vol ) in PBS ( 180 mM NaCl , 3 . 5 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1 . 8 mM K 2 H 2 PO 4 ) for 10 min at RT and permeabilized for 10 min with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS on ice . Background signals were blocked by incubating cells for 1 h at RT in 3 % BSA / PBS . Subsequently , they were incubated in the dark with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in 3 % BSA / PBS , stained with DAPI , and mounted with Elvanol . Fluorescent images were acquired with a LSM 780 confocal microscope ( Zeiss ) equipped with 100× / NA 1 . 46 and 40× / NA 1 . 4 oil objectives and operated by Zen software ( version 2 . 1 ; Zeiss ) . Image acquisition was performed at am - bient temperature . Images were processed and analyzed with ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) or Photoshop ( Adobe ) . Immunoprecipitations and pull - down assays For immunoprecipitation of paxillin , cells were lysed in β 1 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 05 % sodium deoxycholate , and 10 mM EDTA ) and incubated with paxillin antibodies for 2 h at 4°C while rotating . Subsequently , lysates were JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 11 • 2017 3796 incubated with 50 µl protein A / G Plus Agarose ( Santa Cruz Biotech - nology ) for 2 h at 4°C . After repeated washes with lysis buffer , proteins were eluted from the beads using Laemmli buffer , separated on a 10 % SDS - PAGE , and analyzed by Western blotting . For immunoprecipitation of GFP - tagged proteins , cells were lysed in M - PER ( 78501 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) or β 1 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 05 % so - dium deoxycholate , and 10 mM EDTA ) and proteins were immunopre - cipitated using the μ MACS GFP Isolation kit ( 130 - 091 - 288 ; Miltenyi Biotec ) for 20 min on ice following the manufacturer’s protocol . For the Ni pull down , 10 µg recombinant His – kindlin - 2 was bound to 30 µl Ni Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) in 0 . 5 ml M - PER buffer ( 78501 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 1 – 2 h at 4°C under rotation . After several washes , the beads were incubated with 12 . 5 µg purified Arp2 / 3 complex in 0 . 5 ml M - PER buffer containing 80 mM imidazole for 2 h at 4°C under rotation . After three washes with M - PER buffer contain - ing 80 mM imidazole , proteins were eluted by boiling the samples for 7 min at 95°C in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against kindlin - 2 , ArpC5A , and Arp3 . Kindlin - 2 interactome analysis by MS qKO cells expressing T1 - mCherry and EGFP - K2 or EGFP were kept in suspension for 20 min at 37°C . Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in M - PER before incubation with 50 µl magnetic beads coupled to monoclonal mouse anti - GFP antibody ( 130 - 091 - 288 ; Miltenyi Biotec ) for 20 min on ice . Cell lysates were added to magnetic col - umns and washed four times with M - PER buffer and once with wash buffer II containing 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . Purified proteins were predigested on - column by adding 25 µl 2 M urea in 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , and 150 ng Trypsin for 30 min at RT and eluted by adding two times 50 µl 2 M urea in 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , and 5 mM chloroacetamide . After overnight incubation at RT , the digestion was stopped by adding 1 µl trifluoroacetic acid , and the peptides were purified using C18 stage tips ( Rappsilber et al . , 2007 ) . The samples were loaded on a 15 - cm column packed with 1 . 9 - μ m C18 beads ( Dr Maisch GmbH ) via the nanoLC - 1200 autosampler ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and sprayed directly into Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The mass spectrometer was operated in data - dependent mode with the Top N acquisition method . The raw data were processed using the Max - Quant computational platform ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) . The peak lists generated were searched with initial precursor and fragment mass tolerance of 7 and 20 ppm , respectively . Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was used as static modification , and oxidation of methionine and protein N - terminal acetylation was used as variable modification . The peak lists were searched against the UniProt Mouse database , and the proteins and peptides were filtered at a 1 % false discovery rate . Proteins were quantified using the MaxLFQ algorithm in Max - Quant ( Cox et al . , 2014 ) . Spreading and adhesion assays Cells were grown to 70 % confluence followed by overnight incuba - tion in DMEM containing 0 . 2 % FCS . After detaching with trypsin / EDTA , cells were serum starved for 1 h in adhesion assay medium ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 137 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 4 . 5 g / l glucose , and 3 % BSA [ wt / vol ] ) in bacterial dishes . Flat - bottom 96 - well plates were coated with 10 µg / ml FN ( Calbiochem ) , 1 µg / ml VN ( 07180 ; StemCell ) , or 5 % BSA diluted in PBS . Cells were then plated ( 40 , 000 per well ) in adhesion buffer supplemented with 8 % FCS and 5 mM Mn 2 + where indicated and in - cubated for 30 min at 37°C . After vigorous washing with PBS , cell attachment was measured by fixing and staining with crystal violet staining ( 0 . 1 % in 20 % methanol ) in an absorbance plate reader at a wavelength of 570 nm . For cell spreading , 40 , 000 cells were seeded on 10 µg / ml FN or PLL ( 0 . 01 % wt / vol ) – coated coverslips , cultured for the indicated time points at 37°C , fixed with 4 % PFA ( wt / vol ) in PBS , and stained with phalloidin – Alexa Fluor 647 and DAPI . At least 10 images were taken using a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope equipped with a 63× / NA 1 . 4 oil objective , and cell spreading area was measured using AxioVision software ( release 4 . 8 . 2 ; Zeiss ) . For phase contrast analysis of spreading cells , 50 , 000 cells were seeded on 10 µg / ml FN - coated six - well plates and cultured at 37°C . Living cells were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Cell Imaging System ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) equipped with an EVOS Onstage Incubator using a 20× / NA 0 . 4 objective at 37°C . Images were analyzed with ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) . Rac1 GTPase activity Cells were grown in DMEM containing 0 . 2 % FCS overnight , detached with trypsin – EDTA , and starved for 1 h in adhesion assay medium in bacterial dishes . Cells were then plated on 10 µg / ml FN – coated dishes in serum - free medium containing 5 mM Mn 2 + . Cell lysis and active Rac1 - GTPase pull - down was performed using the active Rac1 Pull - Down and Detection kit ( 16118 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . The active Rac1 signal was normalized to the total protein level of the GTPase . Statistical analysis All experiments were repeated at least three times ( as indicated in figure legends ) . Statistical significance ( * , P < 0 . 05 ; * * , P < 0 . 01 ; * * * , P < 0 . 001 ; * * * * , P < 0 . 0001 ; n . s . , not significant ) was determined by two - tailed unpaired t test and performed with Prism ( GraphPad ) . Online supplemental material Fig . S1 shows the intra - and interprotein cross - links between kindlin - 2 and paxillin as well as the Zn 2 + dependence of kindlin – paxillin bind - ing . Fig . S2 shows the FA recruitment of different kindlin - 2 dele - tions . Fig . S3 displays the kindlin - 2 – Arp2 / 3 interaction in the absence of either vinculin or FAK . Fig . S4 shows the spreading behavior of kindlin - 2 RL / AA – expressing cells . Supplemental data 1 is a detailed overview of the high - confidence lysine – lysine cross - links of the kindlin - 2 – paxillin complex .
