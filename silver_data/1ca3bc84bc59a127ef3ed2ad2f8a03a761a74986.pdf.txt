Helicobacter pylori infection is the strongest known risk factor for this malignancy . An important goal is to identify H . pylori - infected persons at high risk for gastric cancer , so that these individuals can be targeted for therapeutic intervention . H . pylori exhibits a high level of intraspecies genetic diver - sity , and over the past two decades , many studies have endeavored to identify strain - speciﬁc features of H . pylori that are linked to development of gastric cancer . One of the most prominent differences among H . pylori strains is the presence or absence of a 40 - kb chromosomal region known as the cag pathogenicity island ( PAI ) . Current evidence suggests that the risk of gastric cancer is very low among persons harboring H . pylori strains that lack the cag PAI . Among persons harboring strains that contain the cag PAI , the risk of gastric cancer is shaped by a complex interplay among multiple strain - speciﬁc bacterial factors as well as host factors . This review discusses the strain - speciﬁc properties of H . pylori that correlate with increased gastric cancer risk , focusing in particular on secreted proteins and surface - exposed proteins , and describes evidence from cell culture and animal models linking these factors to gastric cancer pathogenesis . Strain - speciﬁc features of H . pylori that may account for geographic varia - tion in gastric cancer incidence are also discussed . A bout 2 million new cancer cases each year worldwide are at - tributable to infections ( 1 ) . Hepatitis viruses , papillomavirus , and Helicobacter pylori are responsible for most of these malignan - cies ( arising in the liver , cervix , and stomach , respectively ) . Since H . pylori is the only bacterium known to be a common cause of cancer in humans , the relationship between H . pylori and gastric cancer is of particular interest . A large body of evidence links H . pylori to two types of stomach cancer—gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric lymphoma . This re - view focuses on gastric adenocarcinoma , the most common type of stomach cancer . Epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of gastric cancer is higher in H . pylori - infected persons than in H . pylori - negative persons and that H . pylori infection precedes the development of gastric cancer ( 2 – 4 ) . H . pylori is associated with adenocarcinoma of the distal ( noncardia ) stomach but not cancer of the proximal stomach . Experimental orogastric infec - tion of Mongolian gerbils with H . pylori can result in the develop - ment of gastric cancer ( 5 ) , which provides further evidence of a causative role . Consequently , the International Agency for Re - search on Cancer ( World Health Organization ) classiﬁes H . pylori as a group I carcinogen ( 4 ) , a category that includes well - known carcinogens such as tobacco smoke and asbestos . H . pylori colonizes the stomach and elicits a gastric mucosal inﬂammatory response termed “gastritis” in both humans and experimentally infected animals . Once established in the human stomach , H . pylori and gastric inﬂammation can persist for many decades in the absence of antimicrobial treatment . Longitudinal studies indicate that gastritis is one of the ﬁrst detectable changes in a stepwise pathway of histologic abnormalities that can ulti - mately culminate in gastric cancer : inﬂammation , gastric atrophy ( loss of specialized cell types such as parietal cells and chief cells ) , intestinalmetaplasia ( presenceofintestinal - typeepitheliuminthe stomach ) , and dysplasia ( 6 , 7 ) . The development of gastric cancer in the setting of H . pylori infection is thought to be a long - term consequence of many alterations , including chronic inﬂamma - tion ( which contributes to the pathogenesis of many types of ma - lignancy ) ( 8 ) , DNA damage , activation of gastric stem cells , changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis , changes in epithelial differentiation and polarity , degradation of tumor suppressors , and impaired gastric acidiﬁcation , leading to bacterial overgrowth with species not found in the normal acidic stomach ( 6 , 7 ) . EPIDEMIOLOGY OF GASTRIC CANCER The incidence of gastric cancer varies markedly throughout the world , and it occurs about twice as commonly in males than fe - males ( 3 ) . The highest incidence rates are currently observed in East Asia ( about 60 cases per 100 , 000 males in Japan and Korea ) ( 3 ) . In all parts of the world , H . pylori is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer ( 3 , 4 ) . Regions of the world with a low prevalence of H . pylori infection tend to have a relatively low in - cidence of gastric cancer , but geographic variation in gastric can - cer rates cannot be explained entirely by variations in H . pylori prevalence . For example , populations in many parts of Africa and India have a high prevalence of H . pylori infection but a relatively low incidence of gastric cancer ( 3 ) . Although H . pylori is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer , most H . pylori - infected persons tolerate the presence of this organism over an entire lifetime without any adverse effects , and some persons may even derive health beneﬁts from H . pylori ( 9 ) . An important goal is to deﬁne the factors that determine whether gastric cancer will develop , so that the subset of H . pylori - infected persons with the highest risk of gastric cancer can be identiﬁed and targeted for therapeutic interventions .

PYLORI STRAIN - SPECIFIC PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH GASTRIC CANCER H . pylori is characterized by a high level of intraspecies genetic diversity ( 10 , 11 ) . Diversity in the nucleotide sequences of indi - vidual genes is attributable to a high mutation rate , as well as a high rate of intraspecies recombination ( 12 , 13 ) . Strains from un - related persons not only differ in the sequences of individual genes but also exhibit differences in gene content and chromosomal organization . The core genome of H . pylori consists of about 1 , 100 genes ( present in all H . pylori strains ) , and each strain typically contains several hundred additional genes that are not universally present . Over the past two decades , numerous studies have analyzed H . pylori isolates from persons with different disease states in an effort to identify strain - speciﬁc features that correlate with the presence of gastric cancer or premalignant histologic lesions . This review focuses on strain - speciﬁc variations in secreted proteins or surface - exposed proteins that correlate with increased gastric can - cer risk ( Table 1 ) and describes the actions of these factors in cell culture and animal models that link these proteins to gastric can - cer pathogenesis . The cag pathogenicity island . One of the most striking varia - tions among H . pylori strains from unrelated persons is the pres - ence or absence of a chromosomal region known as the cag patho - genicity island ( PAI ) . Individual strains may contain an intact cag PAI ( about 40 kb ) , a cag PAI that has undergone chromosomal rearrangements , or an incomplete cag PAI that lacks one or more genes ( 14 ) . The cag PAI encodes an antigenic effector protein ( CagA ) and contains about 18 genes required for the entry of CagA into host cells through a type IV secretion system ( T4SS ) - mediated process ( 15 – 17 ) . In addition to its role in translocating CagA into host cells , the type IV secretion system is required for H . pylori - induced upregulation of proinﬂammatory cytokine se - cretion by gastric epithelial cells ( 18 ) . Upon entry into host cells , CagA undergoes tyrosine phos - phorylation by Src and Abl family kinases at sites known as EPIYA motifs ( 16 , 17 , 19 ) . CagA in either its phosphorylated form or its nonphosphorylated form can interact with at least 10 host cell components , resulting in a complex assortment of cellular altera - tions ( 16 , 17 ) . These include changes in epithelial cell shape and polarity ( 20 , 21 ) , disruption of apical epithelial junctional com - plexes ( 22 ) , changes in epithelial differentiation ( resulting in an invasive phenotype , resembling an epithelial to mesenchymal transition ) ( 23 ) , enhanced proliferation and inhibited apoptosis ( 24 , 25 ) , activation of gastric stem cells ( 26 ) , and degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor ( 27 ) . When experimentally introduced into the stomachs of Mongolian gerbils , H . pylori strains contain - ing cagA and an intact cag PAI promote the development of pre - malignant changes and gastric cancer , whereas cagA mutant strains or mutant strains with a defective cag T4SS fail to cause gastric cancer ( 28 – 31 ) . Similarly , strains containing cagA and an intact cag PAI cause more severe gastric inﬂammation in gerbils than do cagA mutant strains or mutant strains with a defective cag T4SS ( 28 – 31 ) . Transgenic mice expressing CagA spontaneously develop gastric epithelial hyperplasia , adenocarcinoma of the stomach and small intestine , and hematologic malignancies ( 32 ) . Therefore , CagA has been designated a bacterial oncoprotein ( 17 ) . A large body of evidence indicates that the risk of gastric cancer or premalignant lesions is higher in persons infected with cagA - positive H . pylori strains than in persons infected with cagA - negative strains ( 33 – 35 ) . The increased risk of gastric cancer ob - served with cagA - positive strains ( which often contain the entire cag PAI ) is attributed to the cellular effects of CagA ( described above ) , combined with an enhanced gastric mucosal inﬂamma - tory response ( 36 ) . Most studies linking CagA - producing strains to increased gas - tric risk have analyzed H . pylori isolates to determine whether the cagA gene is present or absent or have assessed the presence of anti - CagA serum antibody responses as an indication of infection with CagA - producing strains . The risk of gastric cancer among persons infected with CagA - producing strains can be further stratiﬁed by analyzing CagA amino acid sequence variations that inﬂuence the protein’s activity . For example , the level of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation in host cells is inﬂuenced by the number of EPIYA motifs within the protein that can undergo phosphory - lation ( Fig . 1 ) . CagA proteins containing higher numbers of EPIYA motifs exhibit enhanced binding to intracellular targets and enhanced activity within host cells ( 37 – 39 ) , and strains har - boring higher numbers of EPIYA motifs ( Fig . 1 ) are associated with greater gastric cancer risk ( 40 , 41 ) . The intracellular activity of CagA is also inﬂuenced by amino acid sequence variations within the tyrosine phosphorylation motifs . For example , strains TABLE 1 Strain - speciﬁc H . pylori features that correlate with gastric cancer risk Gene or region Encoded protein ( s ) Feature of gene in H . pylori strains a Higher gastric cancer risk Lower gastric cancer risk cag PAI CagA and T4SS Present Absent cagA Effector protein More EPIYA motifs * Fewer EPIYA motifs EPIYA - D motif * Lack of EPIYA - D motif EPIYA - B motif * EPIYT - B motif High levels of CagA production * Lower levels of CagA production vacA Secreted toxin s1 , i1 , m1 forms s2 , i2 , m2 forms babA OMP Present Absent sabA OMP In frame Out of frame homB OMP Present Absent oipA ( hopH ) OMP In frame Out of frame hopQ OMP Type I form Absence of type I form dupA VirB4 homolog Absent Present a cagA - positive strains are associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer than are cagA - negative strains . Among cagA - positive strains , those producing CagA with the features indicated with an asterisk are associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer . Minireview 2 ® mbio . asm . org January / February 2016 Volume 7 Issue 1 e01869 - 15 containing EPIYT - B motifs are less frequently associated with gas - tric cancer than are strains containing EPIYA - B motifs ( 42 ) . Among H . pylori strains that produce CagA , there is variation in the levels of CagA production . This variation is attributable to nucleotide sequence variation downstream of the cagA transcrip - tional start site , within the 5 = untranslated region of the cagA tran - script ( Fig . 1 ) ( 43 , 44 ) . Two recent studies showed that strains producing high levels of CagA are linked to an increased risk of premalignant lesions compared to strains producing lower levels of CagA ( 43 , 44 ) . Vacuolating toxin . H . pylori secretes a protein known as VacA through an autotransporter or type V secretion pathway ( 45 – 47 ) . VacA was originally identiﬁed based on its capacity to cause vac - uolation of epithelial cells ( 48 ) but is now known to have a much broader range of activities ( 45 – 47 ) . The amino acid sequence , structure , and cellular effects of VacA are unrelated to those of any other known bacterial toxins ( 49 ) . Most VacA - induced cellular alterationsareattributabletoitscapacityforporeformationincellmembranes ( 45 – 47 ) . All H . pylori strains contain a vacA gene , and nearly all secrete a VacA protein , but there is considerable variation among strains in VacA - mediated effects on host cells . This is due to differences among strains in the levels of VacA produced or secreted ( 50 ) , as well as amino acid sequence variation among VacA proteins . Sev - eral families of vacA alleles have been described based on se - quences differences in regions of vacA designated the s , i , and m regions ( Fig . 1 ) ( 51 – 53 ) . Type s1 / i1 / m1 forms of VacA are more active in assays of cell - vacuolating activity than are forms of VacA designated s2 , i2 , or m2 , and type s2 forms of VacA lack detectable activity in this assay ( 51 , 52 , 54 , 55 ) . The differences in activity of type s1 and s2 forms of VacA are attributable to impaired channel - forming properties of the type s2 protein ( 54 ) . Thus far , most studies of VacA cellular effects have been con - ducted with type s1 / i1 / m1 forms of VacA . Studies with this form of the protein indicate that it enters host cells through a clathrin - independentprocessandcanultimatelylocalizeinendosomesaswellasmitochondria ( 56 – 58 ) . Consequences of VacA intoxication in ep - ithelial cells include altered endosomal function ( 59 ) , changes in mi - tochondrial membrane permeability ( 56 ) , stimulation of autophagy ( 60 ) , reactive oxygen species accumulation ( 61 ) , and sometimes cell death ( 45 – 47 ) . VacA inhibits the acid - secretory capacity of parietal cells ( 62 ) and causes functional alterations in a variety of immune cells . Inhibitory effects of VacA on T cells have been studied in the most detail ( 63 , 64 ) , but B cells , eosinophils , mast cells , and dendritic cells are also targeted ( 45 – 47 ) . Strains containing vacA alleles classiﬁed as s1 , i1 , or m1 ( en - codingthemoreactiveformsofVacA ) areassociatedwithahigher risk of gastric cancer or premalignant lesions ( such as intestinal metaplasia ) than strains classiﬁed as s2 , i2 , or m2 ( 34 , 41 , 52 , 65 ) .

Multiple possible combinations ( s1 / i1 / i1 , s2 / i2 / i2 , s1 / i2 / m2 , etc . ) can be present in different H . pylori strains as a result of recombination .

The increased risk of gastric cancer associated with strains producing more active forms of VacA may be a consequence of several actions , including the capacity of VacA to stimulate gastric epithelial cell injury , alter parietal cell function and gastric acidi - ﬁcation , and interfere with immune cell function . Outer membrane proteins and DupA . The H . pylori genome contains about 60 genes that are predicted to encode outer mem - brane proteins ( OMPs ) . While many OMP - encoding genes are conserved among all H . pylori strains , others may be present or absent in individual strains , and production of OMPs can be reg - ulated by slipped - strand mispairing within polynucleotide repeat regions . Two of the most extensively studied OMPs , BabA and SabA , function as adhesins that mediate H . pylori binding to gas - tric epithelial cells . BabA binds to the fucosylated Lewis b histo - blood group antigen on host cells , and SabA binds to the sialyl dimeric Lewis x glycosphingolipid ( 66 , 67 ) . In addition to its role in mediating H . pylori adherence to epithelial cells , SabA can func - tion as a sialic acid - dependent hemagglutinin and has a role in nonopsonic activation of neutrophils ( 68 ) . Several studies have reported that infection with H . pylori strains containing in - frame babA or sabA genes is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer , premalignant changes , or en - hanced gastric inﬂammation , compared to infection with strains that lack these genes or that harbor out - of - frame genes ( 69 – 72 ) . When challenged with a BabA - producing H . pylori strain , trans - genic mice expressing the BabA receptor developed more severe gastritis , atrophy , and anti - parietal cell antibodies than infected wild - typeanimals ( 73 ) . TheseresultsindicatethatBabA - mediated adherence modulates the outcome of infection . Three other OMPs ( HomB , HopQ and HopH [ OipA ] ) have been linked to gastric cancer . HomA and HomB are two closely related H . pylori OMPs ; individual strains may contain one or both of the corresponding genes ( 74 ) . Similarly , two forms of HopQ ( designated type I and type II ) have been described ; indi - vidual strains may contain one or both of the corresponding genes ( 75 ) . Strains containing homB or type I hopQ or in - frame hopH ( oipA ) alleles have been associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer , compared to strains lacking these features ( 72 , 76 – 78 ) . The presence of an in - frame hopH ( oipA ) allele contributes to development of gastric cancer in Mongolian gerbils and has been linked to increased gastric inﬂammation in mice ( 29 , 79 ) . In com - parison to a wild - type strain , a homB mutant strain exhibited di - minished adherence to gastric epithelial cells and reduced capacity to stimulate production of the proinﬂammatory cytokine inter - leukin 8 ( IL - 8 ) ( 74 ) . HopQ is required for maximal activity of the cag T4SS ( 80 ) . Cell culture experiments suggest that HopH ( OipA ) can contribute to H . pylori adherence ( 81 ) and also may have a role in regulating expression of proinﬂammatory cytokines and other processes in gastric epithelial cells ( 82 ) . HopH ( OipA ) does not contribute to stimulation of cytokine expression unless the cag PAI is also present ( 81 , 83 ) . Finally , a gene designated dupA ( for “duodenal - ulcer - promoting gene” ) , located within a nonconserved region of the H . pylori chromosome known as the plasticity region , is reported to be a marker of gastric cancer risk . Strains containing this gene have been associated with a reduced risk of gastric atrophy and gastric cancer compared to strains lacking this gene ( 84 , 85 ) . There is variation among strains in the length of the dupA ORF , and this may also inﬂuence the risk of gastric cancer ( 86 , 87 ) . The dupA gene exhibits weak sequence similarity to virB4 components of type IV secretion systems , but at present it is not known whether dupA has a similar activity in H . pylori . DupA is reported to have a role in stimulating IL - 8 production in gastric epithelial cells and promoting H . pylori survival at low pH ( 84 ) , and strains contain - ing active forms of the dupA gene induce proinﬂammatory cyto - kine production in mononuclear cells ( 86 ) . Associations of speciﬁc OMPs or dupA with gastric cancer have been detected less consistently than associations between the cag PAI or vacA and gastric cancer . Nevertheless , a substantial body of experimental evidence indicates that several OMPs and dupA in - ﬂuence H . pylori - host interactions , and as discussed below , there is an association between the presence of several of these genes and the presence of the cag PAI and type s1 vacA . These OMPs and DupA may contribute to gastric cancer pathogenesis by augment - ing H . pylori adherence , enhancing the activity of the cag T4SS , inﬂuencing H . pylori - induced signaling in host cells , or stimulat - ing proinﬂammatory immune responses . RELATIONSHIPS AMONG STRAIN - SPECIFIC DETERMINANTS OF GASTRIC CANCER RISK Intraspecies genetic recombination occurs commonly in H . pylori , and the species is considered to have a recombinational popula - tion structure ( 12 , 13 ) . Therefore , most polymorphisms are dis - tributed randomly among individual strains ( 12 ) . Interestingly , the strain - speciﬁc features associated with gastric cancer ( Table 1 ) tend to be distributed nonrandomly , even though these genes are localized at unlinked sites in the H . pylori chromosome . For ex - ample , the majority of cag PAI - positive strains contain type s1 vacA , babA , homB , type I hopQ , and in - frame oipA alleles , and the majority of cag PAI - negative strains contain type s2 vacA , type II hopQ , and out - of - frame oipA alleles and lack babA and homB ( 51 , 69 , 74 , 75 , 81 , 83 , 88 , 89 ) . The nonrandom distribution of strain - speciﬁc features associ - ated with gastric cancer ( Table 1 ) is presumably attributable to selective forces that favor certain combinations . Recent studies in cell culture models have revealed functional interactions among these proteins that may account for the observed associations . For example , both CagA and VacA are used by H . pylori to acquire nutrients such as iron from host cells ( 90 ) , and this process may require a balanced activity of the two proteins . In addition , the effects of CagA on gastric epithelial cells are attenuated by the presence of VacA , and the actions of VacA are attenuated by the presence of CagA ( 91 – 94 ) . VacA stimulates degradation of CagA through autophagy ( 61 ) , which may account for some of the observedantagonism . FunctionalinteractionsbetweenOMPsand the T4SS also have been reported ( 80 , 95 ) . For example , BabA and HopQ can potentiate cag T4SS - dependent phenotypes ( 80 , 95 ) . In addition , cag - positive strains stimulate expression of a host cell gene required for synthesis of sialyl Lewis x ( the receptor for the SabA adhesin ) ( 96 ) . By inducing higher levels of gastric inﬂam - mation , cag - positive strains can indirectly stimulate increased SabA - mediated attachment of the bacteria to epithelial cells . Several studies have analyzed the correlation between multiple strain - speciﬁc features and the development of gastric cancer . These studies indicate that the risk of gastric cancer is highest in persons infected with strains harboring multiple constituents listed in Table 1 ( e . g . , cagA , type s1 vacA and babA ) ( 34 , 69 ) . Strains harboring few or none of these features are less frequently Minireview 4 ® mbio . asm . org January / February 2016 Volume 7 Issue 1 e01869 - 15 associated with gastric cancer . Collectively , these studies suggest that there is a spectrum of strains , ranging from those associated with a very high incidence of gastric cancer to those associated with a very low risk of gastric cancer . GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN GASTRIC CANCER INCIDENCE The incidence of gastric cancer varies markedly throughout the world , for reasons that are not well understood . Since the inci - dence of gastric cancer is particularly high in East Asia ( 3 ) , efforts have been directed toward comparing H . pylori isolates from East Asia with isolates from other parts of the world . One of the most striking observations is that several of the strain - speciﬁc features linked to high gastric cancer risk ( including the cagA PAI , type s1 forms of vacA and babA ) are present in nearly all East Asian H . py - lori isolates ( 88 , 97 , 98 ) . Conversely , cagA - negative strains con - taining type s2 vacA alleles and lacking babA are commonly found in the United States and Western Europe but are rarely isolated in East Asia ( 51 , 88 , 89 ) . The predominance of strains harboring cagA , type s1 vacA , and other strain - speciﬁc markers linked to gastric cancer ( Table 1 ) may be one of the factors contributing to a high rate of gastric cancer in East Asia . Most H . pylori isolates from East Asia constitute a distinct groupbasedonmultilocussequencetypingofhousekeepinggenes ( 99 ) , andgenesunderpositiveselection ( including cagA and vacA ) are highly divergent in East Asian strains compared to strains iso - lated elsewhere in the world ( 100 ) . The distinctive properties of CagA in East Asian strains have been studied in the most detail . Speciﬁcally , a CagA tyrosine phosphorylation motif ( EPIYA - D ) found exclusively in East Asian strains is associated with a higher level of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation within cells and greater cellular effects than are seen with non - Asian forms of CagA ( 37 , 101 , 102 ) . Correspondingly , strainsproducingCagAproteinswith EPIYA - D motifs have been associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer than strains producing other forms of CagA ( 103 ) . There has been relatively little effort to analyze the functions of other proteins besides CagA in East Asian strains compared to non - Asian strains , but East Asian forms of AlpA and AlpB outer mem - braneproteinsarereportedtohavedifferenteffectsonsignalingingastricepithelialcellsthanformsofAlpA / AlpBfoundelsewherein the world ( 104 ) . Thus , specialized properties of CagA and other constituents in East Asian H . pylori strains may contribute to the high incidence of gastric cancer in that part of the world . Varia - tions in host genetics and environmental factors are also likely to contribute to geographic differences in gastric cancer incidence . RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BACTERIAL AND HOST RISK FACTORS FOR GASTRIC CANCER Multiple host - related factors are known to be determinants of gastric cancer risk ( 105 ) . In the context of H . pylori infection , polymorphisms in genes involved in cytokine production have been studied in the most detail ( 6 , 105 , 106 ) . An association be - tween gastric cancer risk and polymorphisms linked to IL - 1 (cid:2) pro - duction is relevant because this cytokine not only contributes to gastric inﬂammation but also regulates gastric acid secretion . Sev - eral studies have shown that the contribution of speciﬁc bacterial factors to gastric cancer risk is augmented in persons who have speciﬁc genetic risk factors . For example , the risk of gastric cancer is particularly high in persons harboring certain polymorphisms in genes encoding cytokines ( IL - 1 (cid:2) , tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ] , and IL - 10 ) who are infected with H . pylori strains containing type s1 vacA and cagA ( 34 , 106 , 107 ) . Thesestudiesindicatethattherisk of gastric cancer is determined by both bacterial and host factors . The composition of the human diet is another factor that in - ﬂuences gastric cancer risk . For example , a high - salt diet and a diet low in fruits and vegetables have been associated with increased gastric cancer risk ( 3 , 108 ) . A relationship between composition of the diet and strain - speciﬁc H . pylori risk factors for gastric cancer also has been observed in experiments with animal models of gas - triccancer . Speciﬁcally , Mongoliangerbilsinfectedwitha cag PAI - positive strain and fed high - salt or low - iron diets had an increased incidence of gastric cancer compared to infected animals fed a regular diet , whereas the high - salt and low - iron diets did not con - fer an increased risk of gastric cancer in animals infected with a cagA mutant strain or uninfected animals ( 30 , 31 ) . The mecha - nisms by which dietary composition inﬂuences gastric cancer risk are not yet well understood . Changes in H . pylori gene transcrip - tion in response to the composition of the diet may be one mech - anism . For example , H . pylori produces increased levels of CagA when exposed to high - salt conditions ( 109 ) , and low - iron condi - tions stimulate enhanced activity of the cag T4SS ( 30 ) . These re - sults in animal models suggest that certain dietary risk factors for gastric cancer are relevant mainly in persons who are infected with cag PAI - positive strains . Multilocus sequence typing of housekeeping genes in H . pylori isolates from human populations throughout the world has al - lowed the identiﬁcation of groups of strains with distinct geo - graphic distributions ( 99 ) . The observed patterns of geographic diversity suggest that H . pylori has been present in humans for at least 100 , 000 years ( 110 ) , that H . pylori accompanied humans out of Africa in multiple waves of migration beginning about 60 , 000 years ago ( 111 ) , and that H . pylori strains subsequently diversiﬁed in relative isolation in various parts of the world ( 111 ) . Evolutionary theory posits that prolonged association of patho - genic organisms with hosts should lead to a progressive loss of virulence . Since H . pylori has been associated with humans for at least 100 , 000 years , one might anticipate a gradual reduction in the capacity of these bacteria to cause disease . The development of a commensal or symbiotic relationship between H . pylori and humans is presumably dependent on co - evolution of the bacteria and human hosts over a prolonged time period . In many parts of Africa , a high proportion of humans carry H . pylori , but the rate of gastric cancer is relatively low ( a phenomenon known as the African enigma ) ( 3 ) . Similarly , a re - cent study in the country of Colombia revealed that humans of African origin , when infected with H . pylori strains of African origin , had relatively benign gastric pathology with little evidence of progression to gastric cancer ( 112 ) . The low incidence of dis - ease in these populations illustrates a relationship between H . py - lori and humans reﬂecting coevolution of both species over a pro - longed period of time . Introduction of H . pylori into a noncoevolved human population may result in a less favorable outcome . In support of this hypothesis , mismatch between the geographic origin of H . pylori strains and the geographic ancestry of human hosts has been associated with more severe gastric pa - thology and development of premalignant gastric lesions ( 112 ) . These ﬁndings bolster the view that gastric cancer risk is inﬂu - enced by both bacterial and host factors and suggest that disrup - tions in coevolved bacterial - human relationships may contribute to elevated gastric cancer risk .

Most previous studies have analyzed H . pylori strains isolated from single gastric biopsy specimens obtained at the time when gastric cancer was diagnosed . In future studies , more robust sam - pling approaches will allow analysis of H . pylori strains at earlier time points ( prior to the development of gastric cancer ) and will allow the detection of multiple strains of H . pylori within individ - ual stomachs . Inhibition of T4SS - mediated phenomena has been observed in vitro when cell lines are coinfected with two different H . pylori strains ( 113 ) , and similarly , diminished severity of dis - ease has been observed in human subjects coinfected with cagA - positive and cagA - negative strains ( 114 ) . Therefore , further stud - ies of the functional consequences of coinfection with multiple strains of H . pylori are warranted . Thus far , only a few candidate strain - speciﬁc H . pylori genes have been evaluated to detect possible links to gastric cancer , and often the analysis has been limited to a determination of whether a gene is present or absent . In future studies , it will be important to use a more comprehensive approach for analyzing H . pylori ge - netic variation to permit analysis of a larger number of strain - speciﬁc bacterial factors . In addition to determining whether genes are present or absent , important insights will be gained by investigating whether the encoded proteins are produced , analyz - ing levels of gene transcription or protein production , and analyz - ing variations in gene sequences that are linked to variations in protein function . It will also be important to investigate further the functions of the strain - speciﬁc H . pylori features listed in Ta - ble 1 as well as newly identiﬁed strain - speciﬁc constituents in cell culture and animal models and thereby elucidate the mechanisms by which these factors contribute to gastric cancer pathogenesis . Recent studies have revealed functional interactions among several bacterial factors linked to gastric cancer pathogenesis ( 91 – 94 ) . Developing an improved understanding of these functional interactions and the effects of such interactions on gastric cancer pathogenesis is also an important goal . For example , since VacA can inhibit the actions of CagA in cell culture models , it will be important to determine whether imbalances in VacA and CagA production can inﬂuence gastric cancer risk . Further investigation of the geographic variation in gastric cancer incidence is also warranted . In particular , there has been relatively little effort thus far to evaluate whether the variations in amino acid sequences of H . pylori proteins in strains from different geographic regions are accompanied by alterations in protein function and whetherthissequencevariationinﬂuencesthedevelopmentofgastriccancer . It will also be important to investigate further the coevolved relationshipsbetween H . pylori andhumansthatminimizetheriskof gastric cancer , as well as the molecular basis by which disruption in these relationships leads to increased cancer risk . In summary , a large body of evidence indicates that there is a correlation between the risk of gastric cancer and strain - speciﬁc features of H . pylori strains , and studies in cell culture systems and animal models provide mechanistic support for the observed cor - relations . In future studies , it should be possible to deﬁne more clearly the role of strain - speciﬁc H . pylori constituents in gastric carcinogenesis . A better understanding of this topic may lead to the development of improved methods to identify H . pylori - in - fected persons at high risk for development of gastric cancer , so they can be targeted for therapeutic interventions .
