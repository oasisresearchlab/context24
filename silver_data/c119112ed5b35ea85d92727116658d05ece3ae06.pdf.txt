DOI 10 . 1002 / bit . 23253 ABSTRACT : Nanoparticles are increasingly important in medical research for application to areas such as drug delivery and imaging . Understanding the interactions of nanoparticles with cells in physiologically relevant environ - ments is vital for their acceptance , and cell – particle inter - actions likely vary based on the design of the particle including its size , shape , and surface chemistry . For this reason , the kinetic interactions of ﬂuorescent nanoparticles of sizes 20 , 100 , 200 , and 500 nm with human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) were determined by ( 1 ) measur - ing nanoparticles per cell at 37 and 4 8 C ( to inhibit endocy - tosis ) and ( 2 ) modeling experimental particle uptake data with equations describing particle attachment , detachment , and internalization . Additionally , the inﬂuence of cell sub - strate compliance on nanoparticle attachment and uptake was investigated . Results show that the number of binding sites per cell decreased with increasing nanoparticle size , while the attachment coefﬁcient increased . By comparing HUVEC grown on either a thin coating of collagen or on top of three - dimensional collagen hydrogel , nanoparticle attach - ment and internalization were shown to be inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by the substrate on which the cells are cultured . This study concludes that both particle size and cell culture substrate compliance appreciably inﬂuence the binding of nanoparticles ; important factors in translating in vitro stud - ies of nanoparticle interactions to in vivo studies focused on therapeutic or diagnostic applications .

KEYWORDS : polystyrene nanoparticle uptake ; nanotoxi - city ; 3D cell culture ; compliance ; HUVEC ; collagen ; dextran Introduction Nanotechnology has rapidly progressed into an exciting ﬁeld , and the push towards the nano - scale has led to many medical advances . The use of nanoparticles to deliver an encapsulated or attached agent to a speciﬁc site has promise to enhance efﬁcacy , reduce toxicity , improve imaging , and tune the biodistribution of a given therapeutic or imaging agent ( Singh and Lillard , 2009 ) . Nanoparticles of various shapes , sizes , and surface chemistries have been investigated for therapy and imaging applications . While these properties are highly advantageous in tuning nanoparticles for a particular application ( Caldorera - Moore et al . , 2010 ) , they also contribute to the complexity of understanding how nanoparticles interact with their target cells . Currently , it is customary for researchers to evaluate nanoparticles for toxicity , targetability , and efﬁcacy using in vitro cell cultures before proceeding to animal studies to evaluate the nanoparticle in vivo . The two - dimensional ( 2D ) nature of most adherent culture systems , whereby cells are grown either on a bare or protein - coated tissue culture plate or glass substrate , fails to translate into in vivo relevance , possibly because the 2D environment is a poor mimic of the biological complexity of the three dimensional ( 3D ) in vivo environment including the extracellular matrix , Correspondence to : K .

Two - dimensionally cultured cells and in vivo cells differ in many aspects including gene expression ( Grifﬁth and Swartz , 2006 ) , biosynthesis of extracellular molecules ( Albrecht et al . , 2006 ) and cytoskel - etal components ( Cukierman et al . , 2001 ) , and biological activity such as proliferation ( Bhatia et al . , 1998 ; Heldin et al . , 2004 ) . For these reasons , the biological interactions of nanoparticles may be more appropriately studied in vitro using a 3D culture environment . In both a 3D and 2D environment in vitro , substrate compliance has been shown to greatly affect the compliance of the endothelial cells themselves cultured atop the substrate resulting from a change in actin stress ﬁbers ( Byﬁeld et al . , 2009 ) . To the authors’ knowledge , no study to date explores the inﬂuence of cell substrate compliance on the binding of nanoparticles , a potentially important factor in translating in vitro studies of nanoparticle binding behavior to in vivo relevance . In this study , we use cells cultured on a thin coating of collagen or on the surface of a collagen hydrogel of non - negligible height to differentiate between the 2D and 3D extracellular environment of different compliance in vitro . Many nanotherapies rely on vascular targeting or travel through the vasculature to reach an intended target . Nanoparticles of several sizes have been shown to deposit preferentially in the endothelium of vessels and largely avoid penetration into the media and adventitia ( Chesler and Enyinna , 2003 ) . While the main strategy for delivery of nanoparticles to tissues up to now has been the enhanced permeability and retention effect , recent research in the area of vascular biodiversity ( Sergeeva et al . , 2006 ) suggests wide utility for nanoparticle targeting to the endothelium . Human endothelial cells are studied here in vitro as a model of the vessel wall that nanomaterials encounter upon intravenous injection . This study explores the kinetics of binding of polystyrene nanoparticles with diameters from 20 to 500 nm to elucidate how particles of varying size bind to the cell surface and are internalized . Sedimentation varies over the range of nanoparticle diameters studied and is accounted for in a system of equations based on a single cell model of attachment ( Goodman et al . , 2008 ; Wilhelm et al . , 2002 ) . These equations are used in conjunction with data collected using human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) cultured on top of 2D or 3D collagen exposed to polystyrene nanoparticles to obtain the kinetic coefﬁcients . Materials and Methods Cell Culture HUVEC were cultured according to the supplier’s directions with modiﬁcations described here . HUVEC ( Lonza , Walkersville , MD ) were seeded from cryopreservation at passage 4 , cultured on 0 . 1 % gelatin ( BD Difco , Mississauga ON , Canada ) coated tissue culture ﬂasks in endothelial growth medium ( EGM , Lonza ) containing 2 % serum . Well plates were prepared prior to introduction of cells by coating with collagen or preparation of 3D collagen gels . HUVEC were grown to conﬂuence on 48 - well plates before addition of nanoparticles . Studies involving dextran were conducted using EGM adjusted to a viscosity of 3 . 0 cP by including dextran ( Spectrum Chemical Mfg , Gardena , CA ) at a concentration of 3 . 02 g per 100 mL media . Culture medium was replaced with dextran - containing EGM just prior to introduction of particles . Preparation of Collagen Substrates Thin collagen coatings ( 2D ) were prepared by mixing rat - tail type I collagen ( 5 mg / mL stock , Gibco , Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) with room temperature acetic acid ( 0 . 02 M , Fisher Scientiﬁc , Ottawa ON , Canada ) at 172 . 5 m g / mL ﬁnal collagen concentration , and 150 m L of this solution was evenly pipetted into each well . After 3 h incubation at room temperature , the solution was aspirated , and wells were gently rinsed with DPBS ( Sigma – Aldrich , Oakville ON , Canada ) and placed under ultraviolet ( UV ) light for 15 min prior to seeding with HUVEC at 7 , 500 cells / cm 2 . Alternatively , to form three - dimensional 3 . 5 mg / mL collagen hydrogels in the wells of a 48 - well plate , the following cold reagents were mixed : 1 . 36 mL deionized water , 130 m L 1 M NaOH ( Fisher ) , 0 . 75 mL 10 (cid:1) DPBS ( Sigma ) , and 5 . 25 mL collagen ; 150 m L of the solution was added to each well . Plates were incubated overnight at 37 8 C before gels were washed three times ( 15 min each ) with DPBS . Well plates were placed under a UV light for 15 min prior to seeding with HUVEC at 10 , 000 cells / cm 2 , a higher cell density than 2D collagen cultures due to lower initial cell adhesion to the substrate . HUVEC were seeded on top of the pre - formed gels and did not readily migrate into the gel during the time periods relevant to this study . Gels were visually inspected to verify intactness during washes and media changes . Nanoparticle Uptake Studies Fluosphere 1 particles ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen , Eugene , OR ) were supplied as 2 % w / v suspensions of polystyrene spheres of diameters 0 . 02 , 0 . 100 , 0 . 200 , and 0 . 500 m m loaded with red ﬂuorophore and with surface carboxylic acid moieties . Particles were used after thorough mixing via sonication and vortexing . Standard curves were prepared for each nanoparticle size sample to equate signal to concentration . All samples were run in triplicate . In both 2D and 3D culture systems , care was taken to ensure the conﬂuence of cells prior to exposure to nanoparticles in order to avoid nanoparticles sticking to the cell substrate as opposed to interacting with cells . To determine concentration dependence , nanoparticles were added to cells at concentrations of 1 m L of stock Doiron et al . : Particle Binding Kinetics Dependence on Size 2989 Biotechnology and Bioengineering solution per mL EGM to 320 m L / mL and incubated for 1 h at 4 8 C to inhibit endocytosis . Time dependence was studied at a nanoparticle concentration of 10 m L / mL for 15 min to 48 h at 37 8 C . After addition of particles , plates were agitated on a shaker ( Lab - Line Instruments Inc . , Melrose Park , IL ) for 30 s . After incubation , the media was aspirated and wells were gently washed three times with DPBS . DPBS ( 0 . 5 mL ) was added to each well prior to reading on a plate reader ( SpectraMax M2 , Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) with an excitation wavelength of 580 nm and emission of 605 nm . Confocal Microscopy Cell samples were seeded on glass slides coated with 2D or 3D collagen . For collagen coating , a central area on the slide was masked out using 0 . 0508 cm thick silicon gasket ( Specialty Manufacturing , Saginaw , MI ) with a 1 . 5 cm by 5 cm cutout , and 400 m L collagen solution ( 2D or 3D ) was added to this cutout area . Slides were incubated , washed , and seeded with cells as described in previous section . Conﬂuent cells were incubated with nanoparticles at 10 m L / mL at 37 8 C for 1 h . Slides were washed three times with DPBS and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 1 m L / mL Hoechst 33258 ( Invitrogen ) and CellMask Deep Red ( Invitrogen ) in DPBS . Slides were washed with DPBS , ﬁxed for 10 min at 37 8 C in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma ) , and washed three times with DPBS prior to mounting with VectaShield ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) and coverslip . Imaging of slides was carried out on an Olympus FluoView TM FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope and accompanying software , version 2 . 1b ( Markham , Ontario , Canada ) using a 60 (cid:1) objective . Theoretical Model of Nanoparticle Binding Kinetics and Internalization Particle interactions with cells are characterized by particle movement to the cell surface , particle attachment and detachment to cells , and the internalization of particles , assuming homogeneity of the system , as modeled similarly to previous studies ( Goodman et al . , 2008 ) . Sedimentation From the Bulk Fluid Nanoparticles were assumed to travel to the cell surface via sedimentation , resulting in an increase in concentration at the cell wall compared to the bulk concentration for all particle sizes over time . Sedimentation was incorporated mathematically using an enhancement factor for the concentration at the cell surface , C surface : C surface t ð Þ ¼ 1 þ st h (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:1) C bulk ; ( 1 ) where t is time , h is the height of media ( 1 cm ) over which gravity is acting , C bulk is the starting bulk concentration at time zero , and s is the Einstein – Stokes sedimentation rate deﬁned as : s ¼ 2 r 2 g r p (cid:2) r l (cid:3) (cid:4) 9 m ; ( 2 ) where r is the particle radius , g is the force of gravity , m is the viscosity of the liquid with cell media approximated here as water ( m ¼ 0 . 79 cP at 37 8 C and m ¼ 1 . 5 cP at 4 8 C ) , r p is the density of the polystyrene particle ( 1 . 05 g / cm 3 ) , and r l is the density of the liquid ( water , r l ¼ 0 . 992 g / cm 3 at 37 8 C and r l 1 . 00 g / cm 3 at 4 8 C ) . The concentration of particles near the cell surface changes over time as sedimentation occurs , as described by equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . Single Cell Model of Reaction Kinetics In order to determine the three kinetic rate coefﬁcients , the single cell model of particle interaction ( Wilhelm et al . , 2002 ) was utilized . Equations ( 3 ) – ( 7 ) describe particle interactions with an individual cell in terms of the number of particles bound per cell , N b , the particles internalized per cell , N i , the number of binding sites , N bs , the number of binding sites available at time zero , B , and the total number of particles bound and internalized , N t , evolving over time t . The kinetic rate coefﬁcients for particle adsorption ( binding ) , desorption , and internalization are k a ( M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ) , k d ( s (cid:2) 1 ) , and k i ( s (cid:2) 1 ) , respectively . The number of particles bound on a cell per unit time is proportional to the concentration of nanoparticles in the reservoir at the cell surface ( considered to change over time due to sedimentation as given in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) and the number of binding sites on the cell . Both the number of particles detaching and particles internalized are propor - tional to the number of bound particles , N b ( t ) . The number of bound nanoparticles changes over time following equation ( 3 ) and the number of internalized particles follows equation ( 4 ) . d N b d t ¼ k a CN bs (cid:2) k d N b (cid:2) k i N b ( 3 ) d N i d t ¼ k i N b ( 4 ) The binding capacity of the cell was assumed to remain the same over time ( B ¼ constant ) , i . e . , the cell surface was unobstructed by the surrounding cells and the number of binding sites present ( whether occupied by bound nanoparticles or not ) was assumed constant due to continuous turnover of the membrane . The number of binding sites available for binding ( N bs ) changes over time 2990 Biotechnology and Bioengineering , Vol . 108 , No . 12 , December , 2011 based on the number of particles already bound ( N b ) . N bs t ð Þ ¼ B (cid:2) N b ( 5 ) Solutions to equations ( 3 ) – ( 5 ) give the number of particles bound to the cell surface ( equation 6 ) and the number of bound and internalized particles ( equation 7 ) evolving over time . N b ¼ a 1 (cid:2) e (cid:2) g t ð Þ a ¼ k a CB g g ¼ k a C þ k d þ k i ( 6 ) N t t ð Þ ¼ N b t ð Þ þ N i t ð Þ ¼ a k i t þ g (cid:2) k i g 1 (cid:2) e (cid:2) g t ð Þ (cid:5) (cid:6) ( 7 ) The number of binding sites and the kinetic rate coefﬁcients for particle attachment , detachment , and internalization were determined using the above equations and experimental data of the number of particles attached to the cell at various bulk concentrations over time . Assumptions made in equations ( 3 ) – ( 7 ) included the following : exocytosis was represented as a reduction in k i , endocytosis was assumed to account for all particle internalization based on studies of latex nanoparticles of similar sizes to those used here ( Rejman et al . , 2004 ) , and binding sites were assumed to regenerate immediately upon endocytosis . To estimate the parameter B , concentration - dependent experimental data at 4 8 C were ﬁtted to equation ( 7 ) using non - linear least squares ﬁtting in Matlab 1 version 7 . 8 , where t was inﬁnite due to saturated binding sites and k i was zero due to the absence of endo - cytosis at 4 8 C . For determination of reaction parameters k a , k d , and k i , experimental time - dependence data at 37 8 C were ﬁtted to equation ( 7 ) using the value obtained for B and non - linear least squares ﬁtting in MatLab 1 . Statistical Analysis Error bars represent the standard error calculated from triplicate samples . Goodness of ﬁt was determined by ﬁnding the coefﬁcient of determination ( R 2 ) between the ﬁtted curve derived from coefﬁcients and equation ( 7 ) and the experimentally obtained data points in MatLab 1 . Results Confocal Imaging of Nanoparticles and HUVEC HUVEC grown on top of either 2D or 3D collagen were incubated in the presence of nanoparticles of various sizes for 1 h prior to rinsing and subsequent staining of nuclei with Hoechst 33258 and cell membrane with CellMask Deep Red . The absence of cell migration into the gel as well as the absence of nanoparticles in the underlying collagen substrate was conﬁrmed with image stacks in the z - direction , as shown in Figure 1 with the compressed z - stack as the central image and projections through the z - plane along the yellow lines in the x - and y - directions given as the sidebars . Additionally , z - stacks were taken and compressed into a single view as shown in Figures 2 and 3 of HUVEC grown on 2D and 3D collagen , respectively . For both 2D and 3D , images show an increase in red ﬂuorescence ( particles ) with decreasing size indicating an increase in the binding and / or internalization of particles for smaller particles . Individual particles are below the resolution of the microscope so that counting of particles is not possible , and smaller particles Figure 1 .

Doiron et al . : Particle Binding Kinetics Dependence on Size 2991 Biotechnology and Bioengineering cause a diffuse area of ﬂuorescence rather than being particulate . For the case of 20 nm particles and HUVEC grown on 2D collagen , red ﬂuorescence appears to overlay very closely with the white outline of the entire cell indicating almost no cell membrane area present without being covered with nanoparticles . Conversely , with the other sized particles and all 3D samples , the cell membrane is quite visible while particles are present within the outline of the cell membrane . Qualitatively , it appears from the images that the 2D samples have higher levels of red ﬂuorescence arising from nanoparticles than 3D samples . Further studies were then conducted to quantify differences in nanoparticle uptake between endothelial cells grown on 2D or 3D surfaces for a range of nanoparticle sizes . Endothelial Nanoparticle Adhesion / Uptake Differs With Particle Size For endothelial cells cultured on thin coatings of collagen ( 2D ) , nanoparticle adhesion and internalization were shown to depend on particle size and exposure time . Particle adhesion and uptake increased with time until saturation was reached . While the 20 nm particles did not reach Figure 2 .

The highest levels of adhesion and uptake were seen for the smallest particles ( 20 nm ) , which after 24 h reached levels 300 - fold higher than the next highest adherent nanoparticle ( 100 nm ; Fig . 4 ) . Nanoparticle Adhesion / Uptake is Affected by Extracellular Matrix Compliance Overall , 20 nm nanoparticle uptake was less abundant on endothelial cells on 3D versus 2D substrates as shown in microscopy images ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) and quantitative ﬂuorescence data of nanoparticles ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) , while nanoparticle adhesion and uptake is greater for 3D than for 2D for all other sizes . In order to more accurately compare data from different nanoparticle sizes , computa - tional modeling was performed to correct for differences in sedimentation velocity and endocytosis in determination of kinetic parameters . Number of Binding Sites Decreases With Increasing Nanoparticle Size Conﬂuent cell cultures were exposed to particles at various concentrations at 4 8 C to examine attachment and Figure 3 .

Doiron et al . : Particle Binding Kinetics Dependence on Size 2993 Biotechnology and Bioengineering detachment of particles in the absence of endocytosis . Nanoparticle adhesion to and uptake by endothelial cells was found to be dose dependent at 4 8 C ( Fig . 6 ) . The number of particles adherent to the cells increased signiﬁcantly with decreasing particle size for HUVEC grown on both collagen substrates . Data indicate a leveling off of nanoparticle adherence to cells with increasing concentration of nanoparticles in the reservoir of media . The smaller particles require larger concentrations of nanoparticles in order for this leveling off to occur , i . e . , the cells have a higher binding capacity for the smaller particles .

The number of available binding sites decreased four orders of magnitude ( from (cid:3) 1 (cid:1) 10 8 to 1 (cid:1) 10 4 ) as the particle size increased ; larger particles take up more space on the cell surface , likely blocking binding of other particles . Also , HUVEC grown on 3D collagen had more available binding sites compared to HUVEC grown on 2D collagen coatings , particularly at low particle sizes .

The adsorption rate coefﬁcient , k a , is higher for the 2D culture system for each size except 500 nm diameter particles which have a 3 . 1 fold change for 3D over 2D . For the 20 nm , 100 nm , and 200 nm particles , the adsorption rate coefﬁcient is 6 . 0 , 3 . 6 , and 1 . 4 - fold higher for 2D versus 3D - grown HUVEC . The internalization rate coefﬁcient is larger ( closer to zero ) in the 3D culture system for all sizes except 20 nm particles , which have a 11 - fold higher k i than the same particles in the 2D culture system . For the 100 nm , 200 nm , and 500 nm particles , the internalization rate coefﬁcient is 120 , 140 , and 6 , 700 - fold higher for 3D versus 2D - grown HUVEC . Dextran Effects on Particle Uptake The inclusion of dextran in the cell growth media during exposure to nanoparticles signiﬁcantly reduced uptake and adhesion of nanoparticles . For 2D culture conditions after an hour of exposure to 20 , 100 , 200 , or 500 nm particles , signal from dextran samples was only 15 , 22 , 11 , and 10 % , respectively , of that from the corresponding experiments conducted in the absence of dextran . For the 3D samples , these percentages of dextran signal to no - dextran signal for each ascending particle size were as follows : 11 , 27 , 50 , and 32 % . Data were normalized to the particle concentration at the cell surface to account for viscosity differences . Figure 9 shows nanoparticle adsorption / internalization at each particle size for both culture conditions compared between dextran and non - dextran samples . Discussion In this work , the inﬂuence of cell culture substrate on the binding kinetics of nanoparticles over a range of particle sizes was studied using HUVEC and ﬂuorescent nanopar - ticles . The effect of cell substrate was examined by culturing endothelial cells on a thin coating of collagen or on the surface of a collagen hydrogel , and a noteworthy difference in kinetic parameters resulted from this variation . The number of nanoparticles per cell was determined for particles with diameters from 20 to 500 nm over a range of concentrations and time . These data were ﬁtted to an adaptation of a single cell model of nanoparticle – cell interactions ( Goodman et al . , 2008 ; Wilhelm et al . , 2002 ) incorporating sedimentation .

B : Rate coefﬁcient for internalization ( k i ) of nanoparticles by HUVEC grown on either 2D collagen thin coatings or 3D collagen hydrogel . Data from Figures 4 and 5 were used to determine kinetic coefﬁcients . 2996 Biotechnology and Bioengineering , Vol . 108 , No . 12 , December , 2011 interaction parameters including the number of binding sites available and kinetic rate coefﬁcients of attachment , detachment , and internalization . The parameters vary over the size range of nanoparticles used here ( 20 to 500 nm ) and may hold predictive value for negatively charged particles interacting with endothelial cells . Researchers typically evaluate nanoparticles using in vitro cell cultures , yet the two - dimensional nature and surface rigidity of most adherent culture systems does not accurately represent the biological complexity of the three dimensional in vivo environment ( Grifﬁth and Swartz , 2006 ; Ng and Pun , 2008 ) . In this study , we used HUVEC cultured either on a thin coating of collagen or on the surface of a collagen hydrogel to differentiate between the 2D and 3D extracellu - lar environment of different compliance in vitro . The two cell substrates were seemingly similar in chemical composi - tion and varied primarily in the mechanical properties experienced by the cells . Nanoparticle adhesion and uptake varied signiﬁcantly depending on whether cells were grown on top of 2D or 3D collagen . This is a striking ﬁnding and may carry important implications for in vitro studies mimicking in vivo responses to nanoparticles . It is postulated here that the 3D culture environment more accurately mimics the in vivo environment experienced by a cell . Our ﬁndings support those of others that show surface compliance alters cell responses . At a given concentration , the binding of nanoparticles to the cell surface can be understood as an interplay between the number of available binding sites and the adsorption coefﬁcient k a . The rate at which particles bind to the surface is balanced by the number of available sites to bind . Across the range of nanoparticle sizes studied here , k a increases with increasing particle diameter . Larger particles bind at a higher rate per unit concentration than do smaller particles . Conversely , as particle size increases , the number of available binding sites on the cell decreases . This is postulated to occur due to steric hindrance of the plasma membrane from larger particles , restricting the space available for binding . These statements hold true for both the 2D and 3D collagen substrate cell growth conditions examined here . For all nanoparticle sizes , the number of binding sites per cell is larger for the 3D - collagen cultured HUVEC than for cells cultivated on the 2D substrate . The number of binding sites may differ due to either up - regulation at the protein ( receptor ) level or increased surface area due to compliance of the 3D collagen gel . Additionally , in all cases except the 500 nm particles , the k a values for 2D collagen grown HUVEC were larger than those for 3D culture conditions . The fold change in k a between 2D and 3D conditions decreases with increasing nanoparticle size up to 200 nm , while 500 nm particles have an approximately threefold change from 3D to 2D . The number of nanoparticles per cell after 24 h was higher for cells grown on the 3D substrate for all particle sizes except 20 nm . Therefore , it appears that the increase in number of binding sites dominates over the decrease in attachment kinetics in determining the number of nanoparticles per cell on 3D substrates for 100 – 200 nm particles . For cells grown on 2D collagen , the rate of internalization decreases with increasing particle size . This result is somewhat intuitive in that the larger particles are slower to enter the cell . This result has been shown previously with latex particles ( Rejman et al . , 2004 ) , viral particles ( Matlin et al . , 1982 ) , and polyplexes ( Godbey et al . , 1999 ) . However , this trend is not seen in our work with HUVEC cultures on the surface of 3D collagen hydrogels . In fact , in examining the two particle size extremes , 20 nm and 500 nm , the larger particles are internalized at a higher rate than the small - sized particles . The explanation for this result is not clear here and requires further examination into the mechanism of uptake . The desorption rate coefﬁcient for 3D collagen - grown HUVEC increases with increasing particle size . However , for 2D collagen grown cells , the trend does not hold , and in fact , three of the four nanoparticle sizes have negative values for k d . While this result at ﬁrst seems erroneous , it is possible that the negative values are in fact a result of a more complex occurrence at the cell membrane such as particle aggrega - tion . If one particle binds to the cell surface and a second particle subsequently aggregates to this particle without itself adsorbing to the cell surface , there is no parameter in this single - cell attachment model to account for such an occurrence . The particle would not accurately be described by the k a value or accounted for in the number of binding sites . Therefore , these negative values for desorption may be explained by an agglomeration process or more than one particle being attached per binding site . Dextran largely blocks nanoparticle adsorption and uptake as shown in these results . Dextran is a typical additive to media to increase viscosity for in vitro ﬂow experiments ( Blackman et al . , 2000 ; Rinker et al . , 2001 ; Rouleau et al . , 2010 ) . Results suggest that the presence of dextran blocks interactions between cells and particles , decreasing adherence and internalization . Previous results support this ﬁnding as the dextran sugar molecules can be used to decrease aggregation of particles by blocking charge - based interactions at the particle surface . Figure 9 . Normalized number of nanoparticles bound per cell grown on either 2D or 3D collagen , with sedimentation accounted for , after 1h of exposure in media with or without dextran . Doiron et al . : Particle Binding Kinetics Dependence on Size 2997 Biotechnology and Bioengineering Nanoparticle design is a continually expanding area of research with the intended function depending much on design factors such as size , surface chemistry , shape , surface charge , and other factors . Size has been suggested by Morose ( 2010 ) as an important factor in determining the safety of nanomaterials . As shown in the results presented here , varying nanoparticle size has a large inﬂuence on the attachment and internalization of particles . This informa - tion may be used in the design of nanotherapies and other nanomaterials to result in a cell speciﬁc response . In addition , these results may aid in the understanding of possible toxic effects of nanoparticles , i . e . , nanotoxicity . While the uptake of nanoparticles has been shown to be concentration , time , and energy - dependent ( Davda and Labhasetwar , 2002 ; Panyam et al . , 2003 ) and uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles has been studied in several cell types ( Clift et al . , 2008 ; Lo¨hbach et al . , 2006 ) , the kinetics of uptake have not been determined over a range of sizes for nanoparticles until the present study . Conclusions This study explored the adsorption and internalization kinetics of variously sized nanoparticles in endothelial cells grown on two substrates of different compliance . Experimental data were ﬁtted to equations to extract information on the number of binding sites and kinetic coefﬁcients for adsorption , desorption , and internalization . Nanoparticle attachment and internalization were inﬂu - enced signiﬁcantly by changing the substrate on which the cells were cultured . This study elucidates the importance of particle size in nanoparticle – endothelial cell interactions , as the number of binding sites per cell decreases with increasing nanoparticle size while the attachment coefﬁcient increases . Further , cell culture dimensionality and substrate compliance inﬂuenced the binding of nanoparticles ; this is a potentially important factor in translating in vitro studies of nanoparticle binding to in vivo relevance .
