The action mechanisms of plant cryptochromes Hongtao Liu , Bin Liu , Chenxi Zhao , Michael Pepper and Chentao Lin Department of Molecular , Cell & Developmental Biology , University of California , Los Angeles , CA 90095 , USA Cryptochromes ( CRY ) are blue - light receptors that mediate various light responses in plants . The photoex - cited CRY molecules undergo several biophysical and biochemical changes , including electron transfer , phos - phorylation and ubiquitination , resulting in conforma - tional changes to propagate light signals . Two modes of CRY signal transduction have recently been discovered : the cryptochrome - interacting basic - helix - loop - helix 1 ( CIB ) - dependent CRY2 regulation of transcription ; and the SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA1 / CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 ( SPA1 / COP1 ) - dependent cryp - tochrome regulation of proteolysis . Both CRY signaling pathways rely on blue light - dependent interactions be - tween the CRY photoreceptor and its signaling proteins to modulate gene expression changes in response to blue light , leading to altered developmental programs in plants . Cryptochromes CRYs are photosensory receptors that regulate growth and development in plants and the circadian clock in both plants and animals [ 1 , 2 ] . Plant CRYs are best studied in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) . The Arabidopsis ge - nome encodes three CRY genes , CRY1 , CRY2 and CRY3 . CRY1 and CRY2 act primarily in the nucleus [ 3 , 4 ] , whereas CRY3 probably functions in chloroplasts and mitochondria [ 5 ] . Plants depend on CRYs and other photoreceptors to sense environmental cues , such as irradiance , day – night transition , photoperiods , and light quality for optimal growth and development . It is well known that Arabidopsis CRY1 and CRY2 mediate primarily blue - light regulation of de - etiolation and photoperiodic control of ﬂowering , re - spectively [ 6 , 7 ] . In addition , these two photoreceptors reg - ulate other aspects of plant growth and development , including entrainment of the circadian clock [ 8 – 10 ] , guard cell development and stomatal opening [ 11 , 12 ] , root growth [ 13 – 15 ] , plant height [ 16 – 18 ] , fruit and ovule size [ 19 ] , tropic growth [ 20 – 23 ] , apical dominance [ 16 , 17 ] , api - cal meristem activity [ 24 ] , programmed cell death [ 25 ] , the high - light stress response [ 26 , 27 ] , osmotic stress response [ 28 ] , shade avoidance [ 29 ] and responses to bacterial and viral pathogens [ 30 , 31 ] . Arabidopsis CRY3 belongs to the CRY - DASH clade of the photolyase / CRY superfamily , and it is known to act as a single - stranded DNA - repairing enzyme [ 5 , 32 – 34 ] . However , CRY - DASH of some organ - isms have been reported to have both DNA - repairing enzyme activity and photosensory activity [ 32 , 35 , 36 ] . Arabidopsis CRY3 can also act as a dual - function photo - receptor in mitochondria and chloroplasts . Studies of CRYs have been extensively reviewed during the past decade [ 1 , 2 , 37 – 46 ] . In this review , we focus on recent progress in the study of photoexcitation and signal transduction mechanisms of Arabidopsis CRYs . Photoexcitation of cryptochromes The photoexcitation mechanism of CRYs is not fully under - stood , although it has been proposed to involve light - dependent electron transport [ 46 ] . The CRY apoprotein contains two domains : the N - terminal photolyase - homolo - gous region ( PHR ) domain of approximately 500 residues , and the C - terminal cryptochrome C - terminal extension ( CCE ) domain of various lengths and sequences ( Figure 1b ) . PHR is the chromophore - binding domain of CRYs that bind non - covalently to the chromophore ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) and possibly the second chro - mophore , 5 , 10 - methenyltetrahydrofolate ( MTHF ) [ 47 – 50 ] . FAD is a two - electron carrier that can exist in one of the three different redox states or ﬁve different protonated forms : oxidized ( FAD ) , semi - reduced ( anion radical FAD (cid:2) S or neutral radical FADH (cid:2) ) , and fully reduced ﬂavin ( FADH S or FADH 2 ) ( Figure 1a ) . Among the different redox forms , only the oxidized ﬂavin and anion radical semiqui - none ﬂavin ( FAD (cid:2) S ) absorb signiﬁcant amounts of blue light ( approximately 400 – 500 nm ) . It has been proposed that the oxidized ﬂavin is the ground - state chromophore of Arabidopsis CRYs , because it absorbs blue light most effectively . Arabidopsis CRY1 expressed and puriﬁed from insect cells contained oxidized FAD , which shows an ab - sorption spectrum that peaks at UV - A and blue - light regions [ 47 , 48 ] . Upon illumination , the puriﬁed CRY1 can be reduced to neutral radical semiquinone FADH (cid:2) that characteristically absorbs green light , and then to fully reduced FADH 2 ( or FADH – ) that absorbs little visible wavelengths of light [ 47 , 51 ] . Similarly , puriﬁed Arabidop - sis CRY2 also contains oxidized FAD that can be photo - reduced in vitro [ 49 ] . It was found that addition of green light to blue light partially suppressed blue - light inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and blue - light stimulation of anthocyanin accumulation in Arabidopsis seedlings [ 49 , 51 , 52 ] . The antagonistic effect of adding green light to blue light was also reported for the blue light - induced CRY2 degradation and blue - light promotion of ﬂowering in short day ( SD ) photoperiods [ 49 , 51 ] . Based on these results , a photoreduction cycle was proposed as the photoexcitation mechanism of Arabidopsis CRYs [ 49 , 51 ] . According to this hypothesis , CRYs in the dark Review Corresponding author : Lin , C .

Although the photoreduction hypothesis is consistent with results of several experimental observations , whether this model explains the CRY photoexcitation in vivo is currently under debate [ 46 , 54 – 57 ] . An alternative hypoth - esis argues that the photoexcitation mechanism of CRYs might be similar to that of photolyase and might not involve a bona ﬁde redox reaction ( Figure 1b ) [ 46 ] .

In this model , the resting state of a CRY contains the anion radical semiquinone ( FAD (cid:2) S ) . Upon photon absorption , the excited FAD (cid:2) S transfers an electron to ATP , triggering phosphotransfer and autophosphorylation of the CRY . The electron is subsequently transferred back to flavin to complete the cycle .

Review Trends in Plant Science December 2011 , Vol . 16 , No . 12 685 a circular electron shuttle may occur without a net gain or loss of electrons ; such a circular electron shuttle may be sufﬁcient to trigger conformational changes of CRYs and subsequent signal transduction [ 46 ] . In this regard , it is particularly interesting to compare the structures of photo - lyase and CRY . Arabidopsis CRY1 does not bind pyrimi - dine dimers or repair DNA ; instead , it binds ATP in the FAD - access cavity at the site equivalent to the pyrimidine dimer - binding site of a photolyase [ 58 ] . Importantly , the ribose moiety of ATP penetrates deeply into the FAD - access cavity ; the nucleotide moiety of ATP has a water - mediated contact with FAD ; the phosphates are located near the surface of the PHR domain that probably interacts with the CCE domain [ 58 ] . Given that CRY1 catalyzes autophosphorylation [ 59 – 61 ] , it is conceivable that photo - excitation may result in an electron transport from FAD (cid:2) – to ATP ( analogous to the pyrimidine dimer ) to somehow facilitate phosphotransfer from ATP to a residue of the CCE domain of CRY . The phosphotransfer from ATP to the CCE domain of CRY might contribute to a light - dependent disassociation of the CCE domain from the PHR domain ( analogous to disassociation of the repaired DNA ) , and the backﬂow of the electron from ADP ( analogous to the repaired pyrimidines ) to FAD ( Figure 1b ) . This alternative hypothesis appears consistent with several observations [ 46 , 54 – 57 ] , but it remains speculative and needs to be tested directly . Regardless of the photoexcitation mecha - nism , there seems a present consensus that the photoex - cited CRY adapts an open conformation to undergo further biochemical changes that affects its interactions with other proteins , resulting in alterations of gene expression and developmental programs in plants . Photobiochemistry of cryptochromes Similar to many photoreceptors studied to date , a photo - excited CRY changes its phosphorylation status . Arabi - dopsis CRY1 and CRY2 undergo phosphorylation in etiolated seedlings exposed to blue light , and the CRY phosphorylation is required for its photoactivation [ 59 , 60 , 62 , 63 ] . The CCE domains of Arabidopsis CRY1 and CRY2 are approximately 180 and 110 residues in length , respectively , and are thought to at as an effector domain [ 41 – 44 ] . The CCE domain appears intrinsically unstructured , but it may change conformation upon pho - toexcitation , presumably by light - induced folding [ 63 – 68 ] . It has been proposed that blue light - dependent phosphor - ylation of CRYs causes electrostatic repelling of the CCE domain from the surface of the negatively charged PHR domain of CRY [ 63 – 68 ] , resulting in separation of the two domains to trigger or alter the interaction between CRYs and their signaling partners [ 68 , 69 ] . Because multiple serine residues of a CRY are phosphorylated in response to light , one or more protein kinases are probably involved in CRY phosphorylation in addition to autophosphoryla - tion [ 59 , 62 ] . However , the protein kinase ( s ) responsible for the complete phosphorylation of Arabidopsis CRY has not been identiﬁed , although multiple protein kinases , includ - ing an AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , a casein kinase I ( CKI e ) , a glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK - 3 b ) and a mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , have been found to phosphorylate mammalian CRYs [ 70 – 74 ] . Blue light - dependent phosphorylation of Arabidopsis CRY appears to trigger ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the photoreceptor , in addition to the con - formational changes [ 4 , 69 , 75 ] . Similar to phytochromes , for which phyA but not other phytochromes , undergoes rapid degradation in red light , only CRY2 but not CRY1 is rapidly degraded in blue light [ 75 , 76 ] . This observation suggests that different CRYs use different mechanisms for desensitization . As expected , the blue light - dependent CRY2 degradation requires the ﬂavin chromophore , be - cause the CRY2 D387A mutant protein that fails to bind FAD no longer undergoes blue light - dependent degradation [ 77 ] . Both CRY2 phosphorylation and degradation take place in the nucleus , suggesting that the photoexcited CRY2 is sequentially modiﬁed by the kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases in the nucleus [ 69 ] . Results of a domain swap experiment indicate that both the PHR domain and the CCE domain are required for the blue light - dependent degradation of CRY2 [ 75 ] . Indeed , the fusion protein GUS – CCT2 , which contains only the CCE domain of CRY2 without the PHR domain , is constitutively phosphorylated , but no longer degraded regardless of blue - light treatment [ 4 , 62 , 69 ] . CRYs in other organisms also undergo ubiquiti - nation - dependent degradation , and the E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for degradation of mouse ( Mus muscu - lus ) and Drosophila ( Drosophila melanogaster ) CRYs have been identiﬁed [ 78 – 82 ] . The multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 ( COP1 ) seems to be associated with CRY2 degradation in Arabidopsis , because CRY2 degradation is partially impaired in cop1 weak mutant alleles ( cop1 - 4 and cop1 - 6 ) [ 62 , 66 , 67 ] . However , CRY2 still undergoes blue light - dependent degradation in the cop1 null allele ( cop1 - 5 ) [ 62 ] ( B . Liu and C . Lin , unpublished data ) , suggesting a possi - ble involvement of additional E3 ubiquitin ligases in blue light - dependent CRY2 degradation . Consistent with this possibility , the SPA proteins that are important for COP1 activity show no direct involvement in blue light - depen - dent CRY2 degradation , because CRY2 appears to degrade normally in the spa1spa2spa3spa4 quadruple mutant ( B . Liu , and C . Lin , unpublished data ) . Further investigations are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism respon - sible for the blue light - dependent ubiquitination of CRY2 . Signal transduction of cryptochromes It seems clear that modulation of nuclear gene expression is the major consequence of blue light - dependent CRY signal transduction , whereby photoexcited CRYs change confor - mation to interact with CRY - signaling proteins , triggering changes in gene expression and developmental programs in plants ( Figure 2 ) . Depending on the conditions of tests , approximately 5 – 25 % of genes in the Arabidopsis genome change their expression in response to blue light ; most of the changes are mediated by CRY1 and CRY2 [ 21 , 83 – 85 ] . The expression of many CRY - regulated genes is also regulated by other signaling pathways , such as phytochromes and phytohormones , suggesting that the CRY - dependent photo - morphogenesis is intimately integrated with the general regulatory networks that control plant development . CRYs mediate blue - light control of gene expression via at least two mechanisms : light - dependent modulation of transcription Review Trends in Plant Science December 2011 , Vol . 16 , No . 12 686 [ e . g . the CRY – CIBs ) pathway ] and light - dependent suppres - sion of proteolysis ( the CRY – SPA1 / COP1 pathway ) . Both mechanisms are involved with blue light - dependent pro - tein – protein interactions of CRYs and the signaling proteins . The CRY2 – CIBs pathway CRY - interacting basic - helix - loop - helix 1 ) is the ﬁrst blue light - dependent CRY2 - interacting protein identiﬁed in plants [ 77 ] . Arabidopsis CRY2 undergoes blue light - specif - ic interaction with the basic - helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) tran - scription factor CIB1 , which was isolated in a blue light - differentiated yeast - two - hybrid screen [ 77 ] . CIB1 positive - ly regulates ﬂoral initiation in a CRY2 - dependent manner and it interacts with the chromatin of the promoter DNA of the FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) gene , which encodes a mobile transcriptional regulator that migrates from leaves to the apical meristem to activate transcription of ﬂoral meristem identity genes [ 86 ] . Arabidopsis CIB1 binds to the G - box ( CACGTG ) DNA sequence with the highest afﬁnity in vitro . However , the transcriptional regulatory activity of CIB1 seems to be indiscriminatory toward G and E boxes ( CANNTG ) in a transient in vivo assay , and the FT promoter contains E box but not G box sequence [ 77 ] . These observations argue for a signiﬁcant difference of the CIB1 DNA - binding activity in vitro and in vivo . One possible interpretation of this predicament would be that CIB1 heterodimerizes with other bHLH proteins to alter their preference or afﬁnity to different DNA sequences in vivo . Consistent with this hypothesis , it was found that at least CIBs CCE CCE CCE SPAs SPAs HYH CO HFR HY5 LRG FT Gene expressionchanges CRY – partner complex CIBs , SPAs etc ( a ) ( b ) PhosphorylatedCRY oligomer Inactive CRY oligomer CIBs COP1 C X X Y Y CCE CCE CCE PHR PHR PHR PHR PHR PHR CRY Cop1 TRENDS in Plant Science Figure 2 . Signal transduction of cryptochromes . ( a ) Photoexcited cryptochrome ( CRY ) changes conformation to initiate signal transduction by interacting with signaling proteins . This model depicts CRY homodimerization via the PHR domains , light - dependent phosphorylation ( negative charges shown ) , changes of protein conformation by the disengagement of the PHR and CCE domains , and interaction with partner proteins , including CIBs , SPAs , COP1 and other yet to be identified CRY - interacting proteins ( X and Y ) . ( b ) Two mechanisms of CRY signal transduction : regulation of transcription via light - dependent interaction of CRYs with transcription factors CIB1 and its relatives ( CIBs ) , and post - translational regulation of proteolysis via light - dependent interaction of CRYs with SPA1 and its relatives ( SPAs ) . The CRY - interacting CIBs activate FT transcription to promote floral initiation . CRYs interact with SPA proteins to suppress the SPA activation of COP1 activity that is required for the degradation of HY5 , HYH , CO and other transcription regulators , resulting in changes of transcription of light - regulated genes ( LRG ) and photomorphogenesis .

Review Trends in Plant Science December 2011 , Vol . 16 , No . 12 687 three CIB1 - related bHLH proteins , referred to as CIB3 , CIB4 and CIB5 , can heterodimerize with CIB1 . The het - erodimers of different CIB proteins , but not the homodi - mers of individual CIB proteins , bind to the E box of the FT promoter in vitro ( H . Liu , and C . Lin , unpublished data ) . More importantly , although monogenic mutations of indi - vidual CIB genes show no apparent phenotypic alterations , the cib1cib3cib5cib4RNAi quasi - quadruple mutant exhi - bits a marked delay of ﬂoral initiation [ 77 ] ( H . Liu , and C . Lin , unpublished data ) . These results suggest that multi - ple CIB proteins act redundantly in the CRY2 – CIB signal transduction pathway to mediate photoperiodic promotion of ﬂoral initiation . Several questions remain to be investigated about the mechanism and regulation of the CRY2 – CIB signaling pathway . For example , it remains unclear whether the blue light - dependent interaction of CIB1 with CRY2 affects the afﬁnity of CIB1 to the E box DNA sequence or the FT promoter in vivo or exactly how the DNA binding or transcriptional regulatory activity of CIB1 is affected by blue light , CRY2 and other CIB proteins . In addition , CIB1 and other CIB proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin - 26S proteasome pathway in plants grown under all light con - ditions except blue light ( H . Liu , and C . Lin , unpublished data ) . It would be interesting to identify the E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for the degradation of CIB1 and related proteins , as well as the photoreceptors mediating blue light - speciﬁc stabilization of these CRY2 - signaling pro - teins . Furthermore , CIB1 and its related CIB proteins do not seem to play major roles in the de - etiolation responses , because no abnormal de - etiolation phenotype has been observed in the monogenic mutants or the cib1 - cib3cib5cib4RNAi quasi - quadruple mutant [ 77 ] ( H . Liu and C . Lin , unpublished results ) . Given that CRY1 is the major CRY mediating blue - light regulation of de - etio - lation , it would be interesting to investigate whether there are blue light - speciﬁc CRY1 - interacting transcription fac - tors that function in de - etiolation or other blue - light responses . The CRY – SPA1 / COP1 pathway In addition to the direct regulation of transcription by interacting with transcription factors , CRYs also indirectly modulate gene expression via post - transcriptional mecha - nisms by interacting with the SPA1 / COP1 complex [ 87 – 89 ] . It is well known that CRYs mediate blue - light sup - pression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 and COP1 - de - pendent proteolysis to affect gene expression [ 83 , 90 ] . For example , CRY1 mediates blue - light suppression of the COP1 - dependent degradation of the bZIP transcription factors LONG HYPOCOTYL5 ( HY5 ) , HY5 HOMOLOGUE ( HYH ) , and the bHLH transcription factor Long Hypocotyl in Far - Red 1 ( HFR1 ) , which regulate transcription of genes required for the de - etiolation response [ 90 – 94 ] . Many of the target genes of CRY1 and HY5 encode signaling proteins functioning in the phytohormones , such as auxin , brassi - nosteroid ( BR ) and gibberellic acid ( GA ) , enzymes catalyz - ing syntheses and degradation of cell wall components , and photosynthetic and other metabolic enzymes . Altered abundance of those signaling proteins and metabolic enzymes can at least partially explain the CRY1 - mediated morphological changes of young seedlings in response to blue light . Similarly , CRY2 mediates blue - light suppres - sion of the COP1 - dependent protein degradation of a major transcriptional regulator of ﬂoral initiation , CONSTANS ( CO ) . The CO protein is a critical positive regulator of ﬂowering in LD ( long day ) , which promotes ﬂowering initiation by activating transcription of the ﬂorigen gene FT [ 95 ] . It has been shown recently that COP1 physically interacts with CO in vivo , and that COP1 facilitates ubi - quitination of CO in vitro [ 96 , 97 ] . CRYs are required for the accumulation of the CO protein in blue light [ 98 ] , whereas COP1 promotes CO degradation in the absence of blue light [ 96 , 97 ] . These observations argue that CRYs mediate blue light - dependent suppression of the COP1 activity to facilitate CO accumulation and ﬂoral initiation in response to photoperiodic signals . It took over a decade to solve the puzzle of how CRYs mediate blue light - dependent suppression of COP1 activi - ty . The ﬁrst hint of the involvement of COP1 in the CRY signal transduction came from a study showing that over - expression of the GUS - fusion proteins of the CCE domain of CRY1 and CRY2 ( referred to as GUS – CCT1 and GUS – CCT2 , respectively ) resulted in constitutive photomorpho - genic phenotype resembling that of the cop1 mutants [ 65 ] . It was subsequently discovered that COP1 physically interacts with CRY1 and CRY2 , albeit in a light - indepen - dent manner [ 66 , 67 ] . These recent studies argue strongly that the CRY / COP1 complex is involved in CRY signal transduction . However , there are some interesting ques - tions remaining . For example , it is not clear why CRY dimerization is required for the activity of the CCE domain of CRYs ( e . g . GUS – - CCT1 and GUS – CCT2 ) but not for their interaction with COP1 . CRY1 and CRY2 form homo - dimers in vivo via the PHR domain , and dimerization is required for the dominant positive ( or cop ) activity of the CCT and / or CCE domains expressed in vivo [ 68 , 99 , 100 ] . However , the CCT and / or CCE domains alone interacted with COP1 in yeast cells or in vitro , but they showed no physiological activity in plants [ 65 , 67 , 68 , 99 ] . More impor - tantly , COP1 interacts with CRY1 or CRY2 in a light - independent manner [ 66 , 67 , 77 ] , leaving the question of how CRYs mediate blue - light suppression of the COP1 activity open at the time of those studies . Two mechanisms have been proposed to answer this question : CRYs may alter the activity or nuclear and / or cytoplasmic distribu - tion of COP1 with some unknown biochemical mechanisms [ 101 ] ; alternatively , CRY might undergo a light - dependent interaction with COP1 - interacting proteins to affect the COP1 activity [ 102 – 106 ] . Direct tests of the second mechanism have been reported in three recent studies [ 87 – 89 ] . These showed that Arabidopsis CRY1 and CRY2 undergo blue light - dependent interaction with the COP1 - interacting protein SPA1 [ 102 – 106 ] . It was found that Arabidopsis CRY1 and CRY2 interact with SPA1 in response to blue light but not red light ; and that SPA1 acts genetically downstream of CRY1 and CRY2 to mediate blue light suppression of the COP1 - dependent degradation of HY5 and CO , respective - ly . Because SPA1 is known to interact physically with COP1 in a light - dependent manner and it is a positive regulator of COP1 [ 103 , 105 , 107 , 108 ] , the blue Review Trends in Plant Science December 2011 , Vol . 16 , No . 12 688 light - dependent CRY – SPA1 interaction appears to at least partially solve the puzzle of how CRYs , which showed no light - dependent interaction with COP1 in the previous studies , mediate light - dependent suppression of COP1 . Unexpectedly , the structurally similar CRY1 and CRY2 interact with SPA1 in different ways . The C - terminal CCE domain of CRY1 interacts with the C - terminal CC - WD domain of SPA1 , whereas the N - terminal PHR domain of CRY2 interacts with the N - terminal kinase - like domain of SPA1 . The different modes of protein – protein interac - tion of CRY1 – SPA1 and CRY2 – SPA1 might explain the different modes of action for the two CRYs . It was shown that CRY1 – SPA1 interaction suppressed SPA1 – COP1 in - teraction in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) and in plant cells [ 88 , 89 ] , arguing that CRY1 may act as a competitive inhibitor of COP1 . The ﬁnding that CRY1 acts as a light - dependent competitive inhibitor of SPA1 – COP1 interac - tion also provides , at least partially , a molecular explana - tion of previous observations that SPA1 – COP1 interaction is suppressed by light [ 103 ] . In contrast to CRY1 , CRY2 – SPA1 interaction does not seem to affect SPA1 - COP1 interaction . Instead , the blue light - dependent CRY2 – SPA1 interaction appears to enhance the CRY2 – COP1 interaction in yeast cells and formation of the CRY2 / COP1 complex in plants [ 87 ] . This observation reveals the photobiological aspect of the effect of CRY2 on COP1 , although exactly how an augmented CRY2 / COP1 complex formation inhibits COP1 activity remains unclear at present . The blue light enhancement of CRY2 – COP1 interaction was observed only in a yeast three - hybrid assay and in a co - immunoprecipitation analysis using ‘sensitized’ Arabidopsis transgenic lines that overexpress SPA1 [ 87 ] , which explains why this phenomenon was not observed previously . Arabidopsis has three SPA1 - related proteins , SPA2 , SPA3 and SPA4 , which function in a partially redundant manner [ 108 , 109 ] . Among the SPA quartet proteins , SPA4 showed a strong blue light - dependent interaction with CRY1 and CRY2 [ 87 – 89 ] . However , whether SPA4 or other SPA proteins play the same or different role as SPA1 in the CRY signal transduction is not clear . It also remains to be elucidated whether the blue light - dependent interaction of CRYs and the SPA1 / COP1 complex might provide a mo - lecular mechanism for the functional interaction , or co - action , of phytochromes and CRYs . SPA1 was originally identiﬁed as a phyA signaling protein that plays important roles in the functions of phytochromes and red and / or far - red light suppression of COP1 activity [ 103 , 107 , 110 , 111 ] . It has been shown that CRYs mediate blue light regulation of the mRNA expression of the SPA genes , suggesting an indirect mechanism for the CRY regulation of phytochrome function [ 85 ] . Given that phytochromes might also physi - cally interact with the SPA1 / COP1 complex [ 107 ] , the newly discovered physical association of the SPA1 / COP1 complex with CRYs argues for a more direct role of the complex in the co - action of phytochromes and CRYs . How light modulates the cellular homeostasis of the phyto - chrome – SPAs / COP1 complex and the CRY – SPAs / COP1 complex to affect photoreceptor signal transduction and photomorphogenesis of plants in nature remains to be further investigated . Concluding remarks and future outlook Signiﬁcant progress has been made over the past few years in understanding the mechanism of action of plant CRYs . The blue light - dependent physical interaction of CRYs with the transcriptional or post - transcriptional regulators of gene expression has emerged as the primary mechanism of CRY signal transduction in plants . However , many aspects of the photochemistry , signal transduction and regulatory mechanisms of CRYs still remain to be eluci - dated . For example , in addition to CIBs , SPAs and COP1 , are there additional CRY - interacting proteins directly in - volved in the early CRY signaling process regulating tran - scription ? What are the protein kinases , phosphatases and E3 ubiquitin ligases required for light regulation of CRYs ? How do CRYs regulate hormone metabolic and signaling genes in different cells to modulate development ? Contin - uous investigations of these questions directly related to CRY photobiology and other questions concerning the system - wide interplay of light and hormonal signal trans - duction pathways are required to understand fully the action mechanisms of plant CRYs .
