Although AIP1 is known to be essential for a number of cellular events involving dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton , the regulatory mechanism of the function of AIP1 is unknown . In this study , we report that two AIP1 isoforms from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , known as UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 , are pH - sensitive in enhancement of actin filament disassembly . Both AIP1isoformsonlyweaklyenhancedisassemblyofADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments at an acidic pH but show stronger disas - sembly activity at neutral and basic pH values . However , a sev - ering - defective mutant of UNC - 78 shows pH - insensitive binding to ADF / cofilin - decorated actin filaments , suggesting that the process of filament severing or disassembly , but not filament binding , is pH - dependent . His - 60 of AIP1 is located near the predicted binding surface for the ADF / cofilin - actin complex , andanH60KmutationofAIP1partiallyimpairsitspH sensitivity , suggesting that His - 60 is involved in the pH sensor for AIP1 . These biochemical results suggest that pH - dependent changes in AIP1 activity might be a novel regulatory mechanism of actin filament dynamics . Regulated disassembly of actin filaments is often required for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton ( 1 , 2 ) . Spontaneous fragmentation and depolymerization of actin filaments are too rare or slow to account for rapid filament turnover or drastic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton . The actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin 2 family of actin regulatory proteins is one of the major groups of proteins that promote severing and de - polymerization of actin filaments and are involved in a number of cellular events that require enhanced turnover of actin fila - ments ( 1 ) . ADF / cofilin binds to the side of actin filaments by cross - bridging two longitudinal actin subunits , and ADF / cofi - lin - bound actin filaments are structurally different from bare actin filaments ( 3 – 7 ) . Filament severing occurs preferentially at a junction between ADF / cofilin - bound and bare segments within a filament ( 8 , 9 ) . Therefore , when actin filaments are fully decorated by ADF / cofilin , severing occurs less frequently than when actin filaments are occupied by ADF / cofilin at a low density ( 10 , 11 ) . Actin - interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) , a conserved WD repeat protein , promotes disassembly of ADF / cofilin - bound actin fil - aments ( 12 ) , and its activity appears to be maximal when actin filaments are fully decorated by ADF / cofilin ( 13 – 16 ) . Although AIP1 has been reported previously to enhance filament disas - sembly by capping the barbed ends of ADF / cofilin - severed actin filaments ( 17 , 18 ) , recent studies have shown that highly purified AIP1 lacks capping activity and still enhances severing of ADF / cofilin - bound filaments ( 16 , 19 – 21 ) . AIP1 further shortens ADF / cofilin - severed actin filaments ( 14 ) and contrib - utes to the maintenance of high concentrations of actin mono - mers in cells ( 22 ) . Therefore , AIP1 and ADF / cofilin are impor - tant players in the actin disassembly mechanism in cytoskeletal remodeling ( 1 , 2 ) . Several regulatory mechanisms for ADF / cofilin are known to be important for spatial and temporal regulation of actin dynamics ( 23 ) , but the mechanism that regulates AIP1 remains unknown . Because the effects of AIP1 on actin are highly dependent on ADF / cofilin , regulation of ADF / cofilin can indi - rectly modulate AIP1 activity . AIP1 is very potent in the disas - sembly of ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments ( 17 , 24 ) . There - fore , an inhibitory mechanism for AIP1 would have to be operated when actin filaments need to be stabilized . Intracellular pH is one of the regulatory factors for the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton ( 25 ) . Several actin - regula - tory proteins exhibit pH - dependent changes in their properties and act as pH sensors for cytoskeletal reorganization ( 26 ) . For example , talin , a focal adhesion protein ( 27 , 28 ) , and hisacto - philin , a histidine - rich protein in Dictyostelium ( 29 ) , bind to actin with higher affinity at low pH . Mammalian cyclase - asso - ciated protein 1 severs actin filaments at acidic pH ( 30 ) . Gelso - lin and adseverin , two related actin - severing and capping pro - teins , are constitutively active below pH 6 . 0 independently of calcium ( 31 , 32 ) . Fascin , an actin - bundling protein , is more sus - ceptible to inhibitory phosphorylation by protein kinase C at * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R01 AR048615 ( to S .

Perhaps the most well characterized pH - de - pendent actin regulator is ADF / cofilin . Most ADF / cofilin pro - teins are sensitive to pH in vitro and exhibit higher activity to promote actin filament disassembly at higher pH ( 35 – 39 ) . Colocalization of ADF / cofilin with actin filaments in cells is enhanced when the intracellular pH is lowered ( 40 ) . Binding of ADF / cofilin ( mammalian cofilin 1 ) with phosphoinositides is enhanced at lower pH under some in vitro conditions , with His - 133 near the C terminus acting as a pH sensor ( 41 , 42 ) . Furthermore , binding of ADF / cofilin with cortactin is reduced at elevated pH ( 43 ) . Either phosphoinositides or cortactin inhibits the interaction between ADF / cofilin and actin , and these pH sensitivities contribute to actin - dependent membrane protrusions in migratory cells ( 41 , 43 ) . However , the precise mechanism of pH - dependent cytoskeletal regulation and other pH sensors that mediate this process remains largely unknown . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , two ADF / cofilin isoforms , UNC - 60A and UNC - 60B , are expressed from the unc - 60 gene by alternative splicing ( 44 ) and have genetically distinct functions ( 45 – 47 ) . UNC - 60A has very weak actin fila - ment - severing and strong monomer - sequestering activities , whereas UNC - 60B has strong actin filament - severing and nearly no monomer - sequestering activities ( 48 , 49 ) . Both of them show only weak pH sensitivity in actin filament disassem - bly when filament severing and depolymerization are examined in solution ( 49 ) . In this study , we found two C . elegans AIP1 isoforms , UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 ( 50 – 52 ) , have pH sensitivity in disassembly of UNC - 60B - bound actin filaments . Therefore , AIP1 may function as a novel pH sensor for the regulation of actin filament dynamics . Experimental Procedures Proteins and Materials— Rabbit muscle actin was purified from acetone powder ( Pel - Freeze Biologicals ) as described pre - viously ( 53 ) . UNC - 60B was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously ( 48 ) . GST alone was expressed from pGEX - 2T ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) and purified using glutathione Uniflow resin ( Clontech ) . Mutagenesis , Expression , and Purification of Recombinant UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 Proteins— GST - tagged UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 were expressed in E . coli and purified as described pre - viously ( 52 , 54 ) . H60K and H60A mutations of AIPL - 1 were introduced by site - directed mutagenesis of the expression vector for AIPL - 1 ( pGEX - AIPL - 1 ) using a QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit . The mutations and other coding sequence for AIPL - 1 were verified by DNA sequencing . Both mutant AIPL - 1 proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified with the same procedures as GST - AIPL - 1 ( wild - type ) . F - actin Sedimentation Assays— Assays were performed in F buffer ( 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 m M MgCl 2 , and 0 . 2 m M DTT ) at various pH values containing 20 m M MES ( pH 6 . 0 ) , 20 m M HEPES ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 20 m M HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 20 m M Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , or 20 m M Tris ( pH 8 . 5 ) . F - actin ( 10 (cid:2) M ) in F buffer was incubated with or without 20 (cid:2) M UNC - 60B and various concentrations of GST , GST - UNC - 78 , or GST - AIPL - 1 for 30 min at room temperature . Then the mixtures were ultracentrifuged at 80 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 20 °C using a Beckman TLA - 100 rotor . Supernatants and pellets were adjusted to the same volumes and subjected to SDS - PAGE ( 12 % acrylamide gel ) and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R - 250 ( National Diagnostics ) . Gels were scanned by an Epson Perfection V700 photo scanner at 300 dpi , and band intensity was quantified using ImageJ . Light - scattering Assays— F - actin ( 4 (cid:2) M ) in F buffer at various pH values was mixed with 5 (cid:2) M UNC - 60B and 0 – 0 . 5 (cid:2) M GST , GST - UNC - 78 , or GST - AIPL - 1 , and light scattering at an angle of 90° and a wavelength of 400 nm ( 5 - nm slit width for both excita - tion and emission ) was measured over time with an F - 4500 fluo - rescence spectrophotometer ( Hitachi High Technologies ) . Direct Observation of Actin Filament Severing by Fluores - cence Microscopy— Rhodamine - and biotin - labeled actin fila - ments ( 20 % rhodamine - and 1 % biotin labels ) were tethered to anti - biotin antibody - coated coverslips and observed with a Nikon TE2000 - U epifluorescence microscope equipped with a high numerical aperture ( NA ) lens ( Plan Apo TIRF ; (cid:2) 60 ; numerical aperture , 1 . 45 ; Nikon ) and an ORCA Flash D4 complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ( CMOS ) camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) as described previously ( 55 ) . The pH of F buffer ( containing 10 m M ascorbic acid as an anti - bleaching agent ) was adjusted by 10 m M HEPES ( pH 6 . 7 or 7 . 5 ) or 20 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 5 ) . Images were recorded for 200 s at a rate of 1 s / frame . Filament - severing events were counted , and the fre - quency ( rate ) of filament severing was calculated as the number of severings per micrometer per micromolar UNC - 60B per second . Direct observation of actin filaments , as shown in Fig . 3 , D and E , was performed as described previously ( 24 ) using DyLight 549 - labeled actin ( 20 % labels ) ( 56 ) , a Nikon TE2000 epifluorescence microscope , andaSPOTRTMonochromecharge - coupleddevice ( CCD ) camera ( Diagnostic Instruments ) . Results C . elegans AIP1s Enhance Disassembly of ADF / Cofilin - bound Actin Filaments in a pH - dependent Manner— The pH sensitiv - ity of UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 , the two C . elegans AIP1 isoforms , was characterized by F - actin sedimentation assays to estimate the extent of filament disassembly in a range of pH values ( 6 . 0 – 8 . 5 ) . UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 were used as GST fusion proteins ( 52 , 54 ) , and GST alone was used in control experiments . UNC - 60B ( a muscle - specific C . elegans ADF / cofilin ) or GST - UNC - 78 alone had only minor effects on the amounts of pelletable actin at the examined pH values ( Fig . 1 , A and E ) . Slight increases in unpelletable actin at high pH were also detected by actin alone to similar extents ( Fig . 1 E , circles ) , which is consistent with a previous report of suppressed actin polymerization at high pH ( 57 ) . In these experiments , an excessive concentration of UNC - 60B ( 20 (cid:2) M ) was added to F - actin ( 10 (cid:2) M ) . Under these condi - tions , although UNC - 60B weakly severs actin filaments , it does not sequester actin monomers , and UNC - 60B - severed fila - ments are still long enough to be sedimented by ultracentrifu - gation ( 49 ) . In the presence of both UNC - 60B and GST - UNC - 78 , actin in the supernatants was increased , and more actin remained in the supernatants with increasing pH ( Fig . 1 , B and E ) . On the basis of the shifts of actin into the supernatant fractions , actin filament disassembly by GST - UNC - 78 was estimated to be enhanced 2 - foldatpH8 . 5comparedwithpH6 . 0 ( Fig . 1 H ) . GSTalonedidnot have detectable effects on actin disassembly ( Fig . 1 G ) . Because pH Regulation of AIP1 MARCH 4 , 2016• VOLUME 291•NUMBER 10 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 5147 UNC - 60B by itself did not show significant pH sensitivity in this assay , we concluded that UNC - 78 had pH - sensitive activity to dis - assemble UNC - 60B - bound actin filaments .

At pH 6 . 0 , GST - AIPL - 1 only slightly enhanced disassembly of UNC - 60B - bound actin filaments ( Fig . 1 D , lanes 1 and 2 ) , but this activity was greatly enhanced with increasing pH ( Fig . 1 , D and F ) , resulting in a 3 - fold increase in actin disassembly at pH 8 . 5 compared with pH 6 . 0 ( Fig . 1 H ) . Both GST - UNC - 78 and GST - AIPL - 1 showed pH - sensitive effects in a wide range of concentrations , with maximum activities above 1 – 2 (cid:2) M of GST - UNC - 78 ( Fig . 1 I ) or GST - AIPL - 1 ( Fig . 1 J ) . AIP1 - dependent actin disassembly was also examined by light - scattering assays at different pH values ( Fig . 2 ) . C . elegans AIP1s are most effective in filament disassembly when binding of UNC - 60B to F - actin is saturated ( 15 , 52 ) . Under these con - ditions , UNC - 60B nearly completely quenches the fluorescence of pyrene - labeled actin filaments ( 49 ) . Therefore , we used light scattering to monitor the kinetics of filament disassembly . At pH 6 . 5 and 8 . 0 , UNC - 60B ( 5 (cid:2) M ) instantaneously increased light scattering of F - actin ( 4 (cid:2) M ) because of F - actin binding that increased the mass of the filaments , which was followed by very slow decreases , most likely because of weak actin depolymeri - zation or filament severing ( Fig . 2 , A and B , red curves ) . There - fore , UNC - 60B alone did not show pH sensitivity in this assay , as reported previously ( 49 ) . GST did not have significant effects on the UNC - 60B - induced changes in light scattering ( Fig . 2 , A and B , cyan curves ) . Both GST - UNC - 78 and GST - AIPL - 1 decreased light scattering of UNC - 60B - bound actin filaments at pH 6 . 5 or 8 . 0 ( Fig . 3 A , green and blue curves , respectively ) . At pH 8 . 0 , both GST - UNC - 78 and GST - AIPL - 1 induced faster and greater drops in light scattering than at pH 6 . 5 , indicating stronger activities of GST - UNC - 78 and GST - AIPL - 1 at basic pH ( compare Fig . 2 , A and B , green and blue curves , respec - tively ) , which is consistent with the results of the F - actin sedi - mentation assays . GST - AIPL - 1 consistently induced slower disassembly than GST - UNC - 78 in three independent experi - ments ( representative data are shown in Fig . 2 , A and B ) . There - fore , these kinetics results are consistent with the F - actin sedi - mentation assays ( Fig . 1 ) in which GST - UNC - 78 showed stronger activity than GST - AIPL - 1 under all examined condi - tions . The results provide qualitative evidence that disassembly of UNC - 60B - bound actin filaments by UNC - 78 or AIPL - 1 is enhanced at basic pH . Recent studies by multiple groups have clearly demonstrated that enhanced filament severing by AIP1 is one of the mecha - nisms to promote filament disassembly ( 16 , 19 – 21 ) . Therefore , we examined effects of pH on actin filament severing by AIP1 using time - lapse imaging of single actin filaments ( Fig . 3 ) . The severing rates ( Fig . 3 C ) were quantified within initial incubation periods of 15 – 30 s because the length of total filaments did not decrease significantly , which allowed us to accurately estimate the severing frequency . UNC - 60B by itself exhibited modest pH sensitivity in severing surface - immobilized actin filaments ( Fig . 3 , A and C ) . This was unexpected because UNC - 60B by itself has only very weak pH sensitivity in F - actin sedimentation and light - scattering assays ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) ( 49 ) . C . elegans AIP1 iso - forms also showed pH - dependent severing activities . At pH 6 . 7 , GST , GST - UNC - 78 , or GST - AIPL - 1 did not enhance severing of actin filaments in the presence of UNC - 60B ( Fig . 3 C ) . As the pH increased , GST - UNC - 78 strongly enhanced severing ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) , whereas GST - AIPL - 1 modestly enhanced severing only at pH 8 . 5 ( Fig . 3 C ) . To determine whether GST - AIPL - 1 enhances filament sev - ering during a prolonged incubation period , we also analyzed snapshot images before and 2 min after incubation at pH 8 . 0 ( Fig . 3 C ) . At this time point , precise counting of severing events was difficult because of significant shortening and loss of fila - ments . Therefore , we counted the numbers of remaining actin filaments regardless of their length and calculated - fold changes in the numbers of actin filaments before and after the treatments . In the absence of UNC - 60B , there were no major changes in the numbers of filaments ( fold change , (cid:4) 1 . 0 ; Fig . 3 E ) . In the presence of UNC - 60B with or without GST , the number of filaments increased to 1 . 3 - to 1 . 4 - fold because of severing ( Fig . 3 E ) , whereas it was decreased to 0 . 3 - fold by GST - UNC - 78 or 0 . 5 - fold by GST - AIPL - 1inthepresenceofUNC - 60B ( Fig . 3 E ) , indicatingthatactin filament disassembly was enhanced by UNC - 78 or AIPL - 1 by pro - FIGURE 2 . pH - dependent disassembly of actin filaments by UNC - 60B ( ADF / cofilin ) and AIP1 isoforms as determined by light - scattering assays .

All of these results suggest that enhancement of actin filament severing is one of the mechanisms of pH - dependent promotion of actin filament disassembly by AIP1 isoforms . Binding of AIP1 to Cofilin Actin Filaments Is Independent of pH— To understand the mechanism of pH sensitivity of AIP1 , we examined whether binding of AIP1 to ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments is affected by pH .

The amounts of sedimented UNC - 78 or AIPL - 1 was apparently decreased as pH increased ( Fig . 1 , A – D ) . However , sedimented actin was also decreased in the presence of UNC - 60B , and estimation of F - actin binding was not precise under these conditions . To uncouple filament binding from filament disassembly , we used a mutant form of UNC - 78 with defective actin - severing activity . We have reported previously that UNC - 78 with four point mutations ( E126A , D168A , F182A , and F192A ) , designated UNC - 78 ( 4X ) , binds to UNC - 60B - bound actin filaments but does not sever the filaments ( 58 ) . In F - actin co - sedimentation assays in the absence of UNC - 60B , GST - UNC - 78 ( 4X ) co - sedimented with F - actin , but co - sedimentation was decreased with increasing pH ( Fig . 4 , A , lanes 1 – 6 , and B , circles ) . In the presence of UNC - 60B , co - sedimentation of GST - UNC - 78 ( 4X ) with F - actin was enhanced but remained at similar levels at the examined pH values ( Fig . 4 , A , lanes 7 – 12 , and B , squares ) . In addition , GST - UNC - 78 ( 4X ) did not enhance actin filament severing in the presence of UNC - 60B in the microscope assay . 3 These results strongly suggest that binding of AIP1 to ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments is pH - independent and that the subsequent filament severing process by AIP1 is presumably pH - dependent . These exper - iments also show that UNC - 78 retained its property to bind to UNC - 60B - bound actin filaments and was not simply denatured under low pH conditions . A Conserved Histidine Residue of AIP1 Is Involved in pH Sensing— To understand how AIP1 senses pH in the surround - ing solution , we tested whether any histidine residue is involved in pH sensitivity . A histidine side chain ( p K a , (cid:4) 6 . 5 ) is charged positively by protonation at acidic pH but uncharged at basic pH ( 26 ) . UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 have 20 and 19 histidine residues , respectively . However , many of them are buried as integral parts of (cid:3) propellers within a consensus sequence of WD repeats ( 59 ) . By comparing histidine residues exposed on the surface of UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 , we found that His - 60 is com - mon to both UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 and located on the concave surface of UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 , where ADF / cofilin is predicted to bind ( 60 ) ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) , suggesting that ionization states of this residue can influence the activity of AIP1 . Among known AIP1 proteins , histidine is conserved at this position in AIP1s in nematodes and vertebrates ( mammals , birds , reptiles , amphib - ians , and fish ) but not in invertebrates other than nematodes , plants , protozoans , and fungi ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . UNC - 78 has another exposed histidine ( His - 80 ) that is located close to His - 60 ( Fig . 5 A ) , but AIPL - 1 has only one histidine residue at this location ( Fig . 5 B ) . By comparing AIP1 sequences , His - 80 is unique to UNC - 78 ( Fig . 5 C ) . To simplify the analysis , we used AIPL - 1 and replaced His - 60 with Ala ( H60A ) to remove an ionization group or Lys ( H60K ) to add a pH - independent pos - itive charge . AIPL - 1 ( H60A ) is uncharged at this position and expected to mimic a high pH state of AIPL - 1 . This mutant had much weaker activity than the wild type across the examined pH values and failed to mimic an uncharged high pH state of AIPL - 1 ( Fig . 6 A , squares ) . Although the activity of AIPL - 1 ( H60A ) did not suggest its involvement in pH sensing , it indeed suggests that His - 60 is important for the activity of AIPL - 1 . AIPL - 1 ( H60K ) is charged positively constitutively at this position and expected to mimic a low pH state of AIPL - 1 . This mutant had significantly lower activity than wild - type AIPL - 1 at pH 7 . 0 and 7 . 5 ( Fig . 6 A , compare diamonds for the wild type and circles for H60K ) . However , at pH 8 . 0 and 8 . 5 , AIPL - 1 ( H60K ) showed nearly equivalent activity to wild - type AIPL - 1 ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Therefore , a constantly posi - tive charge at position 60 of AIPL - 1 prevents its activity enhancement at (cid:4) pH 7 . 0 , suggesting that uncharging of His - 60 at neutral and basic pH by deprotonation is partly important for pH sensing by AIPL - 1 .

Discussion In this study , we demonstrated that two C . elegans AIP1 iso - forms , UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 , possess pH - sensitive activity to enhance disassembly of UNC - 60B ( ADF / cofilin ) - bound actin filaments . Both UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 enhanced actin disassem - bly more strongly at basic pH than at acidic pH . Association of a severing - defective UNC - 78 mutant with UNC - 60B - bound actin filaments was not pH - sensitive , suggesting that filament disassembly is the pH - sensitive process . Mutations at a con - served histidine ( His - 60 ) residue in AIPL - 1 altered its pH sen - sitivity , suggesting that this histidine is involved in the pH - sen - sitive activity of AIP1 . Therefore , a change in intracellular pH may be a mechanism to regulate AIP1 - dependent actin fila - ment dynamics . To date , pH - dependent modulation of the AIP1 activity , as demonstrated in this study , is the only known regulatory mech - anism for AIP1 . Because actin filament disassembly by AIP1 is dependent on ADF / cofilin , modulation of ADF / cofilin could indirectly influence AIP1 - mediated actin dynamics . Nonethe - less , direct regulation of AIP1 could be an another important mechanism to control actin dynamics . AIP1 is highly effective in actin filament disassembly when F - actin is saturated by ADF / FIGURE5 . MappingofhistidineresiduesonthesurfaceoftheAIP1isoformsUNC - 78andAIPL - 1 .

However , ADF / cofilin is not effective in fila - ment severing at high concentrations but is optimal in filament severing at substoichiometric concentrations ( 8 , 11 ) . There - fore , when active ADF / cofilin is present at high concentrations , alterations in AIP1 activity could trigger rapid changes in actin dynamics without modulation of ADF / cofilin . In vertebrates , ADF / cofilins are relatively strongly pH - sensitive and exhibit higher activities to disassemble actin filaments at basic pH than at neutral and acidic pH ( 35 – 38 ) . If vertebrate AIP1 ( also known as WDR1 ) is also pH - sensitive , then a combination of ADF / cofilin and AIP1 could be a highly sensitive pH - depen - dent regulatory system for actin dynamics . In C . elegans , the two ADF / cofilin isoforms , UNC - 60A and UNC - 60B , are only weakly pH - sensitive in solution , and phosphoregulation of ADF / cofilin has not been demonstrated because homologs of vertebrate ADF / cofilin kinases ( LIM ( Lin - 11 / Isl - 1 / Mec - 3 ) kinases and testis - specific kinases ) and phosphatases ( Slingshot phosphatases ) are absent in the C . elegans genome . Therefore , pH regulation of AIP1 might be one important mechanism to regulate actin filament disassembly . However , the significance of pH changes in cytoskeleton reorganization in C . elegans is currently unknown and will be an important subject for future research . On the basis of these results , we hypothesize a two - step mechanism for AIP1 - mediated severing or disassembly of ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments ( Fig . 7 ) . We have reported previously that the UNC - 78 ( 4X ) mutant can bind to ADF / cofi - lin - bound actin filaments but does not sever them ( 58 ) . This indicates that filament binding and severing / disassembly are two separate processes that can be uncoupled by a mutation . This study further supports this view by demonstrating that filament binding by UNC - 78 ( 4X ) is pH - insensitive but sever - ing / disassembly is pH - sensitive , which strongly suggest that these are two separate processes . If the pH regulation of AIP1 is important in cells , then this two - step mechanism can provide the machinery for rapid actin reorganization . At low pH , AIP1 can be in a “standby mode” by binding to ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments without inducing disassembly . When the pH is raised , these AIP1 - and ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments can be disassembled rapidly . In addition , AIP1 remains bound tran - siently to severed filaments ( Fig . 7 , top right ) and contributes to capping when coronin is present ( 20 ) , but the effect of pH on this process remains to be investigated . Our mutational analysis of AIPL - 1 indicates that His - 60 is involved in pH sensing . However , mutations at His - 60 did not completely abolish the pH sensitivity of AIPL - 1 , suggesting that other residues are also involved in pH sensing . Histidines are part of a consensus sequence of WD repeats ( 59 ) , and most histidines within WD repeats of AIP1 are buried as integral parts of (cid:3) propellers ( 54 ) . We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these histidines are exposed under certain condi - tions and act as pH sensors . We have previously characterized a H535Y mutation of UNC - 78 and found that this mutation sig - nificantly impairs the activity of UNC - 78 and reduces protein levels of UNC - 78 in vivo ( 58 ) . This histidine is a part of a WD repeat and buried in the crystal structure of UNC - 78 , suggest - ing that the H535Y mutation disrupted the conformation of UNC - 78 . Therefore , additional mutagenesis on other histidines is expected to yield similar results or impairment in the solubil - ity of the protein . To identify additional pH sensors in AIP1 , other unbiased non - invasive methods , such as nuclear mag - netic resonance , might be better to identify pH - dependent changes in AIP1 . Whether pH sensitivity is common to AIP1s in other organ - isms remains unknown . Interestingly , His - 60 is conserved in vertebrate AIP1s and nematode AIP1s ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) but not in AIP1s in other organisms . However , as discussed above , additional unknown pH sensors are likely involved , and we can - not predict which AIP1s are pH - sensitive . AIP1s in Drosophila ( flare ) and Dictyostelium have cysteine at a position equivalent FIGURE 6 . Effects of mutations of His - 60 on the pH sensitivity of AIPL - 1 ( AIP1 ) .

Because the p K a value of a cysteine side chain is (cid:4) 8 . 0 , the cysteine could function as a pH sensor at high pH . Therefore , it would be interesting to deter - mine whether AIP1s from different organisms have different pH sensitivities . Both C . elegans UNC - 78 and AIPL - 1 have Cys - 74 near His - 60 ( Fig . 5 C ) . However , Cys - 74 is buried in the molecule and unlikely to participate in the pH regulation . pH sensing mechanisms and pH - dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton are known to be important in the migration of mammalian cells ( 25 , 26 , 61 ) , and ADF / cofilin and AIP1 could function together to enhance the actin dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells . However , the importance of pH on cytoskeletal control in other organisms is poorly understood . Accumulation of biochemical information on pH - sensitive actin regulators and future cell biological and genetic studies may reveal novel links between pH sensing and actin - depen - dent cellular events .
