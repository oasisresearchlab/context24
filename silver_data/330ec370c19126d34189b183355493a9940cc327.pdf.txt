More than half of these proteins are involved in the assembly of a branched network of actin ﬁla - ments to provide the forces required for plasma membrane invagination . Results : To gain insights into the regulation of endocytic actin patchdynamics , wedevelopedaninvitroactinassemblyassay using microbeads functionalized with the nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) Las17 ( yeast WASP ) . When incubated in a yeast extract , these beads assembled actin networks , and a signiﬁcant fraction became motile . Multidimensional protein identiﬁcation technology ( MudPIT ) showed that the recruitment of actin - binding proteins to these Las17 - derived actin networks is selective . None of the proteins known to exclusively regulate the in vivo formation of actin cables or the actin contractile ring were identiﬁed . Our analysis also identiﬁed components of three other cortical structures , eisosomes , phosphoinositide kinase ( PIK ) patches , and the TORC2 complex , establishing intriguing biochemical connec - tions between four different yeast cortical complexes . Finally , we identiﬁed Aim3 as a regulator of actin dynamics at endo - cytic sites . Conclusions : WASP is sufﬁcient to trigger assembly of actin networks composed selectively of actin patch proteins . These experiments establish that the protein composition of different F - actin structures is determined by the protein factor that initiates the network . The identiﬁcation of binding partners re - vealed new biochemical connections between WASP - derived networks and other cortical complexes and identiﬁed Aim3 as a novel regulator of the endocytic actin patch . Introduction Clathrin - actin - mediated endocytosis is a fundamental process in living cells , important for capturing macromolecules from the extracellular environment and regulating plasma mem - brane composition . Many aspects of the molecular mecha - nism of endocytosis are conserved among eukaryotes [ 1 , 2 ] . In budding yeast , at least 60 proteins implicated in this process have been identiﬁed so far based on genetic analysis and localization with ﬂuorescent markers [ 3 – 5 ] . In a highly invariant sequence of events , recruitment of these proteins at the cell cortex is coordinated to ( 1 ) initiate the endocytic site and recruit cargo , ( 2 ) internalize the cell membrane , and ( 3 ) release the endocytic vesicle into the cytoplasm [ 4 , 5 ] . More than half of the endocytic patch proteins are respon - sible for the regulated turnover of a network of actin ﬁlaments , nucleated and crosslinked by the Arp2 / 3 complex around the clathrin - coated pit [ 1 , 5 ] . The actin network provides the force necessary for invagination of the membrane and , later , for scission [ 3 ] . The precise patch protein recruitment and disas - sembly time sequence at endocytic sites has been quantita - tively determined using powerful live - cell imaging techniques [ 4 , 6 – 8 ] , and the peak numbers of molecules that accumulate in patches have been measured in ﬁssion yeast [ 9 ] . An ongoing crucial challenge is to further determine how the endocytic proteins act in concert . The contributions of nearly every iden - tiﬁed endocytic patch protein to these dynamics have been tested in vivo by analyzing the defects caused by mutations [ 4 , 8 , 10 ] . However , these in vivo approaches provide limited mechanistic information and likely fail to identify a complete inventory of proteins . An alternative approach has been to analyze in vitro the mechanism of action of one or a few inter - acting proteins . This approach has been especially effective for studies of proteins controlling nucleation of the actin network by four nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , Abp1 ( actin binding protein 1 ) , Pan1 , Las17 , and the type I myosins [ 8 , 11 – 14 ] . However , such studies are also limited because they only allow analysis of the activities of a few proteins at a time and therefore fail to reveal synergistic properties that emerge in the presence of a multitude of factors . This study was motivated by the fact that comprehension of diverse cellular processes has been realized through the use of reconstituted systems . Of particular relevance to our study , microbeads functionalized with NPFs have been shown previ - ously to stimulate actin assembly in cellular extracts , which often results in bead motility [ 15 ] . Developing such a system for yeast would provide new tools for analysis of the collective behavior of the actin cytoskeleton proteins involved in endocy - tosis , an opportunity to increase the inventory of proteins involved in actin assembly , and possibilities for synergy with genetic studies . Here we report the successful development of such a system for yeast with the identiﬁcation of the proteins involved , establishing that Las17 is sufﬁcient to recruit an actin network composed speciﬁcally of endocytic patch proteins and increasing knowledge of the complex interactions that regulate patch function . Results Assembly of Las17 - Derived Actin Structures in a Yeast Extract In this study , we utilized the fact that Las17 is among the ﬁrst actin regulators recruited to endocytic sites , where it plays a key role in initiating actin assembly . We used puriﬁed full - length Las17 , which is fully active in vitro , in stimulating Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin ﬁlament nucleation [ 8 , 11 ] . We pre - pared extracts from yeast cells grown in log phase , and their * Correspondence : drubin @ berkeley . edu protein concentration was 21 . 1 6 1 . 6 mg / ml . When 2 m m poly - styrene microbeads functionalized with Las17 were incubated in the extract , we observed , under phase contrast optics , pro - gressive assembly of dense clouds around the beads ( Fig - ure 1A , beads 1 and 2 ; see also Movie S1 available online ) . We used an extract prepared from a strain in which Abp1 was fused to green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) in order to deter - mine whether the clouds consisted of actin and associated proteins . Abp1 is a faithful reporter of actin assembly at endo - cytic sites in vivo and was detected in association with the clouds ( Figure 1A ; Movie S1 ) . We observed by time - lapse microscopy that beads existed without any detectable ﬂuorescent signal until a sudden ﬂash of ﬂuorescence corresponding to initiation of actin assembly appeared ( Figure 1A , bead 1 ; Movie S1 ) . This peculiar behavior might be explained by the need for a drifting actin ﬁlament to contact the bead to initiate autocatalytic actin assembly [ 16 ] . Approximately 98 % of the beads were able to trigger actin assembly by 1 hr ( Figure 1B ) . When actin network assembly occurred on one side of a bead , the resultant force induced its motility ( Figure 1A , beads 1 and 2 ; Movie S1 ) , similar to the motility of ActA - coated beads in Xenopus laevis egg extracts [ 15 ] , demonstrating that , even though yeast are nonmotile organisms , their actin machinery can generate forces compa - rable to more complex eukaryotes . Approximately 20 % of the beads became motile by 30 min , and a maximum of 55 % motile beads was reached by 50 min ( Figure 1B ) . The remain - ing beads assembled robust actin ﬁlament shells but did not become motile , reﬂecting an inability to break the actin net - work symmetry ( Figure 1A , bead 3 ; Movie S1 ) . Bead velocity measurements indicate that actin assembly occurs at a rate of 2 . 2 6 0 . 7 m m / min ( Figure 1C ) . This rate is similar to what has been reported in vivo for actin assembly at yeast actin patches ( i . e . , 2 . 7 6 0 . 3 m m / min [ 3 ] ) . This rate is also in the same order of magnitude to actin assembly rates in a Xenopus laevis egg extract , with puriﬁed proteins [ 15 , 17 ] , and in vivo at the leading edge of motile cells [ 18 ] . Multidimensional Protein Identiﬁcation Technology Analysis Reveals the Protein Composition of the Las17 - Derived Actin Networks The design of this assay offered a unique opportunity to purify the Las17 - derived actin networks assembled in the extract in order to further identify their components . In this procedure , we deliberately avoided the use of an actin ﬁlament - stabilizing drug such as phalloidin in order to maintain the structural integrity of the ﬁlament network and to avoid potential exclu - sion of actin - binding partners due to competition for binding sites [ 19 , 20 ] . We estimated by western blot that no more than 15 % of the actin ﬁlaments are lost during our puriﬁcation procedure ( data not shown ) . SDS - PAGE and western blot analysis of the puriﬁed samples conﬁrmed that actin is the main protein associated with the puriﬁed beads ( Figure 2A ) . This protocol speciﬁcally enriched actin cytoskeleton proteins such as actin and Abp1 up to several hundred - fold relative to Pgk1 , a 3 - phosphoglycerate kinase with no known afﬁnity for actin ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . We analyzed the samples by multidimensional protein iden - tiﬁcation technology ( MudPIT ) to determine the protein composition of these WASP - derived actin networks . MudPIT identiﬁes the peptides generated from very complex protein mixtures , because peptides are ﬁrst sorted by multidimen - sional liquid chromatography before identiﬁcation by tandem mass spectrometry [ 21 ] . The MudPIT analysis of three inde - pendent experiments identiﬁed a total of 32 , 695 peptides cor - responding to 1 , 113 yeast proteins ( Figures S1 and S2 ; Tables S1 and S2 ) . Because MudPIT analysis is so sensitive , we developed a statistical method to distinguish enriched pro - teins from background proteins , based on a measure of the relative peptide enrichment for each protein .

Reconstitution of Endocytic Actin Patches 1891 detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures , enabled us to identify 90 of these proteins as the most highly enriched components ( Figure 3 ; Figure S2 ; Table S3 ) . Las17 Is Sufﬁcient to Form Actin Patch - Like Structures of Appropriate Protein Composition Actin patch proteins are recruited to the plasma membrane in a precisely timed and ordered sequence , allowing their classiﬁcation into one of several protein modules involved in different steps of endocytosis [ 4 , 5 ] . Of the 90 proteins identi - ﬁed by MudPIT , 31 have been shown previously to colocalize with endocytic actin patches in vivo [ 4 , 5 , 22 ] ( Figure 3 ; Table S3 ) . Of these 31 actin patch proteins , 30 are recruited either at the same time as Las17 or later in vivo , reinforcing the notion that Las17 plays a central role in formation of these actin struc - tures and establishing that it can , by itself , trigger recruitment A C - Pgk1 - Act1 - Abp1 - GFP 0 . 5 20 20 20 0 . 25 0 . 13 0 . 06 0 . 5 0 . 25 1 2 10 10 10 5 5 5 2 . 5 2 . 5 2 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 25 1 2 0 . 5 0 . 25 1 2 Extract ( µ g ) Purified sample ( µ g ) 0 . 25 0 . 13 0 . 5 1 B Act1 Abp1 GFP 50 37 25 75100150 M , kDa Extract Purified sample SDS - page - Act1 20 Abp1 - GFP Figure 2 .

Current Biology Vol 20 No 21 1892 of most of the proteins that form branched actin ﬁlament networks in actin patches . Syp1 , which was reported to be a negative regulator of Las17 - Arp2 / 3 complex activity [ 23 ] , is the only patch protein detected in our analysis that is recruited to cortical patches before Las17 . Even though positions of many endocytic proteins at the base , tubule , or tip of invaginations have been deduced from positions of ﬂuorescence centroids [ 3 , 4 ] , the size of endocytic sites is comparable to the diffraction limit for light microscopy , making it difﬁcult to precisely determine the position of each protein relative to the plasma membrane and the actin cyto - skeleton during internalization . Moreover , electron micros - copy analysis of protein locations , though powerful , has so far only been applied to a handful of proteins [ 24 , 25 ] . The spatial scale of our bead system provided a new perspective by allowing us to determine whether proteins were localized at the bead with Las17 or in the actin tails , as detailed below . ‘‘Coat’’ and NPF Module Proteins Coat and NPF module proteins arrive around the same time and shape the membrane and / or regulate actin assembly [ 3 , 5 , 10 , 11 , 13 ] . The localization of these components to en - docytic sites in vivo is not F - actin dependent , reinforcing the idea that these proteins function upstream of actin assembly [ 4 , 8 ] . Localizing with Las17 to the bead surface were Sla1 , Vrp1 ( yeast WIP ) , Bbc1 , and Bzz1 ( yeast syndapin ) , whereas the type I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 could also be detected along the actin networks ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . We used the actin monomer sequestering drug latrunculin A ( LatA ) to inhibit actin network assembly and found that none of these proteins require actin assembly to localize to the bead surface . ‘‘Actin Module’’ Proteins Twenty proteins identiﬁed in the puriﬁed samples have been previously classiﬁed as members of the ‘‘actin module’’ directly responsible for organization and dynamics of the actin network ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . In contrast to proteins of the coat module , localization of these proteins in vivo depends on F - actin [ 4 ] . Consistent with this observation , these proteins decorate the actin network formed from the beads in our system ( Figures 4A and 4B ) but could not be detected on the beads in the presence of LatA . Membrane - Shaping Proteins Several proteins conserved from yeast to mammals cooperate with actin to deform the plasma membrane in order to help its invagination and scission during endocytosis ( unpublished data and [ 26 – 28 ] ) . In budding yeast , these proteins include the Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain heterodimer Rvs161 / 167 and the FER - CIP4 homology - BAR ( F - BAR ) domain protein Bzz1 . We found that although Bzz1 is localized with Las17 around the beads , Rvs161 also decorates the actin ﬁlament networks , and neither protein requires actin assembly for recruitment to the bead surface ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . These results suggest that although Bzz1 provides a biochemical link between the membrane and some coat components and / or NPFs in order to regulate actin nucleation , the Rvs complex can also be recruited to the membrane by the actin cytoskeleton itself . Thus , we suggest that the Rvs complex provides a mechanical link between the actin network and the plasma membrane . Among the proteins known to interact with branched actin networks in vivo , only Aip1 and Gmf1 were missing from the MudPIT data set , and Cof1 and Srv2 were not highly enriched relative to other actin - associated proteins ( Table S2 ) [ 22 , 29 ] . However , these proteins could be detected along the branched actin networks as well ( Figure 4B and data not shown ) . Because Aip1 , Gmf1 , Srv2 , and Cof1 are all involved in actin ﬁlament disassembly , it is likely that the actin ﬁlaments decorated by these proteins were primarily disassembled during the preparation of the MudPIT samples . Strikingly , none of the proteins known to exclusively bind and regulate actin cables or the actomyosin ring , each com - posed of parallel networks of actin ﬁlaments , were detected by the MudPIT analysis . These missing candidates include the two isoforms of tropomyosin , Tpm1 and Tpm2 , the yeast IQGAP Iqg1 , the type II myosin Myo1 , and the two type V myosins , Myo2 and Myo4 , even though each of these puri - ﬁed proteins has been shown to interact with actin ﬁlaments in vitro [ 22 ] . We veriﬁed that the actin - binding protein Sac6 ( yeast ﬁmbrin ) , a component of actin patches , decorates the actin tails ( Figure 4A ) and can be detected readily by western blot ( Figure 4C ) , whereas the actin - binding protein tropomyosin ( Tpm1 ) could not be detected in the same samples ( Figure 4C ) . We also veriﬁed by ﬂuorescence micros - copy that the type I myosin Myo5 could be detected along the actin tails ( Figure 4A ) , but not the type II myosin Myo1 ( Figure 4D ) . In total , our results show that a pathway initiated by an NPF triggers recruitment of a speciﬁc subset of actin - binding pro - teins to the ﬁlaments in order to generate an actin network of a speciﬁc composition and properties and establish that the structures induced on Las17 - functionalized beads are actin patch - like structures . Identiﬁcation of Novel Biochemical Connections to Other Cortical Patch Structures Some unexpected proteins were identiﬁed by MudPIT analysis in addition to the 31 known endocytic and actin patch compo - nents . To gain an overview of the biological structures and processes represented by the remaining interacting proteins , we used their respective gene annotations ( GO , The Gene Ontology Consortium , 2000 ; Figure 3 ; Table S3 ) . GO annota - tions draw on many types of data from the literature to orga - nize genes into cellular processes , components , or functions . Interestingly , we found that 20 of these proteins could be grouped into three distinctive protein complexes , namely eiso - somes , target of rapamycin ( TOR ) complexes ( TORC1 and / or TORC2 ) , and phosphoinositide kinase ( PIK ) patches ( Figure 3 ) . These complexes have each previously been implicated in in vivo organization of the actin cytoskeleton and / or in endocy - tosis , but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear [ 30 – 34 ] . Copuriﬁcation of these protein complexes with F - actin networks assembled on Las17 - functionalized beads was surprising because none had been reported to colocalize with actin patches in vivo ; instead they appear in distinct neighboring domains on the cell cortex ( except the TORC1 complex , which shows a vacuolar localization ) [ 35 – 37 ] . How - ever , Osprey - generated networks [ 38 ] indicate that several ei - sosome and TOR complex components interact physically with certain components of the reconstituted actin patch structures ( Figure 3 ) . Only components of the PIK patches did not have previously described interactions with compo - nents of the actin patches . For this reason , we decided to focus on this group of proteins , and we showed by ﬂuores - cence microscopy that they interact with actin tails in our system ( Figure 3 , inset pictures ) . Together , these results suggest physical communication between these various structures in vivo . Reconstitution of Endocytic Actin Patches 1893 Identiﬁcation of Aim3 as a New Endocytic Actin Patch Component of the Actin Module Our analysis identiﬁed other proteins with unknown function or localization . We noticed that many of these uncharacterized proteins are expressed at lower levels in cells . Thus , we hypothesized that some of these proteins might be cortical patch components that had not been discovered previously because of their low abundance . We decided to focus on Aim3 ( a ltered i nheritance rate of m itochondria , also called Ybr108w ) because of reported interactions with several patch proteins , including the BAR proteins Rvs161 and Rvs167 ( Figure 3 ) [ 39 ] . We investigated the in vivo localization of Aim3 by two - color ﬂuorescence microscopy . Aim3 - 3GFP was detected as puncta at the cell cortex ( Figure 5A ) , and simultaneous imaging with Abp1 - RFP showed that more than 96 % ( n = 125 cortical patches ) of the green foci simultaneously colocalized with red foci ( Figure 5A ) , conﬁrming that Aim3 is an actin patch protein . Aim3 - 3GFP localized with the actin networks in the bead assay , and this recruitment was F - actin dependent A Early coat module ( Syp1 ) , Ede1 , Clathrin Late coat module Sla1 , Lsb3 , Sla2 , Pan1 , End3 and NPF module Las17 , Vrp1 , Bzz1 , Bbc1 , ( Myo3 / 5 ) Amphiphysin module ( Rvs161 / 167 ) Actin module Act1 , Arp2 / 3 , Abp1 , Cap1 / 2 , Sac6 , Scp1 , Bsp1 , Twf1 , Crn1 , Prk1 , Cof1 , Aip1 - Sac6 - Tpm1 20 10 5 2 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 25 1 2 Extract ( µ g ) Purified sample ( µ g ) 20 10 5 2 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 25 1 2 Early coat module Late coat module and NPF module Amphiphysin module Actin module Myo1 - GFP Syp1 Rvs161 Abp1 Sac6 Sla1 Pan1 End3 Bzz1 B C Myo5 D + DMSO + latA + DMSO + latA Figure 4 .

( D ) Absence of type II myosin Myo1 on motile Las17 - functionalized microbeads . Current Biology Vol 20 No 21 1894 ( Figure 5B ) . Supporting this conclusion , Aim3 was recruited to and disassembled from cortical patches concomitantly with actin module proteins such as Abp1 ( Figure 5C ) . Although a biochemical link had been previously detected with proteins of the Rvs / amphiphysin module [ 39 ] , Aim3 was recruited before and disassembled after Rvs167 ( Figure 5C ) . To further investigate Aim3’s spatiotemporal localization to actin structures in vivo , we generated an sla2 D strain that expressed both Aim3 - 3GFP and Abp1 - RFP . In this mutant background , Arp2 / 3 - dependent , elongated actin networks accumulate at the cell cortex . These structures allow for the spatial distinction between protein complexes binding actin versus proteins localized to endocytic components [ 3 ] . Con - sistent with an interaction between Aim3 and ﬁlamentous actin at the membrane , we observed that Aim3 and Abp1 colocalize along the elongated actin structures ( Figures 5D and 5E ) . Lastly , we used LatA to disassemble the actin patches , ﬁnding that Aim3 - 3GFP could no longer be detected as foci at the cell cortex but that it showed cytoplasmic staining instead , demonstrating that Aim3 recruitment to the plasma membrane requires F - actin ( Figure 5F ) . A Role for Aim3 in Actin Patch Dynamics We next sought to investigate the contribution of Aim3 to actin patch dynamics . A sensitive diagnostic is to measure in a dele - tion mutant strain the lifetimes of the endocytic patch compo - nents Abp1 and Sla1 [ 4 ] . Absence of Aim3 increased Abp1 life - time at the plasma membrane from 14 . 2 6 1 . 6 s to 20 . 2 6 4 . 3 s while having hardly any effect on Sla1 dynamics ( Figure 6A ) . Next , we considered that functions of numerous proteins are only fully revealed in the absence of a second protein , which may have a redundant function . To test this possibility for Aim3 , we performed a genome - wide synthetic genetic array ( SGA ) screen with an aim3 D deletion allele as a query to uncover AIM3 genetic interactions [ 40 ] . Quantitative assess - ment of aim3 D double mutant ﬁtness phenotypes identiﬁed 26 mutants showing pronounced growth defects [ 40 ] . This subset was signiﬁcantly enriched for genes encoding an actin cytoskeleton regulating or interacting protein ( 15 of 26 ) , including genes encoding capping protein ( Cap1 and Cap2 ) , amphiphysin ( Rvs161 ) , and numerous different actin alleles ( Figure 6B ; Table S4 ) . We measured the impact on Abp1 and Sla1 lifetimes of double knockouts of Aim3 and proteins of the actin and amphiphysin modules . Although absence of Rvs161 induced only a moderate additional effect on Abp1 and Sla1 lifetimes , absence of capping protein had a dramatic effect on Abp1 and Sla1 dynamics in cells lacking Aim3 , wherein these markers had much longer and more variable life - times ( Figure 6A ; 52 . 7 6 20 . 0 s and 125 . 3 6 26 . 9 s for Abp1 and Sla1 , respectively ) , suggesting an important role for Aim3 in regulating actin patch dynamics when another actin regulating function is compromised . Discussion In this article , we described our reconstitution of actin patches in yeast cell extracts . This work provided new insights into molecular pathways for endocytic vesicle formation and clues about mechanisms for assembly of a complex network of actin ﬁlaments of deﬁned protein composition , identiﬁed a new actin patch protein , Aim3 , and revealed interactions with addi - tional cortical patch structures . Patch Reconstitution Identiﬁes Distinct Pathways Mediating Endocytosis Our experiments demonstrated that Las17 plays a central role in the formation of endocytic actin patches , because it can , by itself , recruit the proteins from the ‘‘actin module’’ that appear at endocytic sites at the same time as Las17 or later .

Reconstitution of Endocytic Actin Patches 1895 tails in the bead assay . We suggest , therefore , that a role of Abp1 might be to interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin ﬁlaments in order to compete with additional interactors such as GMF in order to stabilize the actin network against debranching [ 29 ] . In addition , proteins from the coat and NPF modules were recruited directly to the beads , even in the presence of LatA , indicating that Las17 is sufﬁcient to assemble a scaffold of these proteins without actin . A subset of these proteins ( Sla1 , Bbc1 , Syp1 ) negatively regulates Las17 activity , whereas others ( Bzz1 , Vrp1 , and the type I myosins ) release this inhibition or provide additional NPF activity [ 8 , 11 , 23 ] .

In contrast , several other coat module proteins ( Sla2p , Pan1 , End3 ) were not identiﬁed in our studies , and these proteins are not known to regulate Las17 activity .

Current Biology Vol 20 No 21 1896 as a stoichiometric component of the Pan1 complex [ 13 ] , and Sla2 has been shown to downregulate the NPF activity of Pan1 [ 13 ] but not any other NPF . We therefore propose that the NPF Pan1 and its cofactors are recruited by and function in a distinct biochemical pathway from Las17 and the type I myosins . In agreement with our results , each NPF exhibits a unique dynamic behavior at endocytic sites [ 8 , 10 ] . Together , these observations indicate that cells initiate assembly of independent actin ﬁlament networks at the same endocytic sites and at the same time . Evidence for independent path - ways raises the interesting question of how they are coordi - nated in time and space . The MudPIT analysis also revealed the presence of the am - phiphysin / Rvs complex , which interacts with the plasma membrane via its BAR domains . In vivo data show that the actin cytoskeleton is important for the recruitment of the Rvs complex at the membrane [ 4 ] , and a recent model suggests that the initial plasma membrane deformation induced by the actin cytoskeleton could subsequently drive BAR domain accumulation [ 41 ] . Our data now reveal that the Rvs complex can be recruited to the plasma membrane by the actin cyto - skeleton itself , independent of membrane curvature . There - fore , the Rvs complex may represent a physical link between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton . It will be crucial in the future to determine whether the actin cytoskel - eton uses the Rvs proteins as a scaffold to exert an invagi - nating or pinching force on the endocytic membrane . Understanding How Actin Structures of Distinct Organization and Protein Composition Assemble in a Common Cytoplasm Eukaryotic cells are able to form higher - order actin ﬁlament - based structures of distinct organization and protein composi - tion from identical actin monomers . Our work shows that these structures are able to autoregulate themselves in order to recruit the appropriate actin - binding partners required to optimally perform their particular cellular function . It is , for example , interesting that tropomyosin , which binds to actin ﬁlamentsin vitrowitha veryhighafﬁnity butis nota component of cortical patches in vivo , did not decorate our reconstituted actin patches . Thus , our work demonstrates the existence of a mechanism for controlling actin network composition while ﬁlaments continue to assemble and for segregating proteins to different ﬁlament populations . This observation suggests that , at the time they assemble , actin ﬁlaments acquire a speciﬁc identity characteristic of the network to which they belong and that populations of actin ﬁlaments with distinct identities modulate their afﬁnity for various actin - binding proteins . Our results raise an important question concerning how the same actin subunit can , in the same cytoplasm , assemble into structurally and biochemically distinct ﬁlament assemblies . One possible explanation is that different actin - binding pro - teins might compete for binding to actin ﬁlaments because of a steric hindrance [ 42 , 43 ] . However , this explanation does not explain how different ﬁlament populations inside a cell can be decorated differently at the same time , because the binding of these proteins to actin is the result of a chemical equilibrium . This feature suggests that actin ﬁlaments acquire their speciﬁc identity while they assemble and maintain this identity until they age or disassemble . Thus , another reason - able explanation derives from the fact that several proteins , including ADF / coﬁlin [ 44 , 45 ] , tropomyosin [ 42 ] , and barbed end cappers such as gelsolin [ 42 ] and formins [ 46 ] , can alter the ﬁlament conformation . Hence , a hypothesis to consider is that Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly ( such as actin patch assembly in yeast ) prevents tropomyosin binding to actin ﬁla - ments [ 47 ] but allows the binding of other factors such as ﬁm - brin or calponin , whereas formin - mediated actin assembly ( into actin cables and the actomyosin ring in yeast ) leads to formation of linear actin ﬁlaments decorated mainly by tropo - myosin . Actin ﬁlaments decorated by one set of proteins can provide a substrate for the optimal binding of other proteins . This model is consistent with several recent papers showing that tropomyosins dramatically regulate the biochemical prop - erties of several F - actin interacting proteins , such as formins , ﬁmbrins , or myosins [ 48 – 50 ] . Identiﬁcation of New Biochemical Connections at the Cell Cortex Purifying the reconstituted actin patches and determining their composition by MudPIT also gave us a unique opportunity to identify new biochemical connections at the cell cortex . First , our results suggest that some patch proteins may not have been discovered previously because they are expressed at low levels . Here we demonstrated that Aim3 colocalizes with actin patches in vivo and is recruited in vivo with the proteins of the actin module . In agreement with this observation , we re - vealed that Aim3’s function is important for maintaining rapid and efﬁcient actin patch dynamics , especially when another actin module protein such as Cap2 is simultaneously not expressed . Second , we identiﬁed among proteins associated with re - constituted patches multiple components of three different cortical patch complexes , according to their GO annotations . Eight proteins were identiﬁed as components of the eiso - somes , static cortical patch - like structures postulated to be involved in endocytosis [ 30 ] . At least two components from the eisosomes , Pil1 and Lsp1 , have been shown to interact with multiple components of actin patches ( Figure 3 ) . We also identiﬁed four protein components of the recently described PIK patches [ 35 ] as interacting with reconstituted actin patches . PIK patches are reported as static sites at the plasma membrane and are implicated in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis , which is important for actin cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis . Finally , eight other interacting proteins are all components of the TORC1 and / or TORC2 complexes . Both complexes have been shown to be important for organization of the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis in different eukaryotes [ 31 – 33 ] . In particular , Tor2 signals to components required for proper actin organization , such as the GTPase Rho1 , and to two eiso - some proteins , Slm1 and Slm2 ( reviewed in [ 33 ] ) . Aronova et al . showed that many TORC1 and TORC2 components frac - tionate in vitro with detergent - resistant membranes , and a proteomic analysis of these TOR - associated membranes re - vealed the presence of regulators of endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton [ 32 ] . These results may explain the presence of these TOR components in our system , even though we were unable to detect the presence of lipids around the beads or along the actin tails using FM4 - 64 dye staining ( unpublished data ) . Collectively , our work and work reported by others suggest functional interplay between at least four different cortical structures whose components show different localization patterns and different dynamics at the plasma membrane . Future studies are required to elucidate the underlying basis and biological consequences of these interactions . Reconstitution of Endocytic Actin Patches 1897 Experimental Procedures Strains Fluorescent tags were integrated chromosomally to generate C - terminal fusions of each protein , as described in [ 51 ] .
