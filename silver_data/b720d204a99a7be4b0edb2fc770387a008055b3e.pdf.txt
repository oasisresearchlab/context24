Proteins in the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin family are essential for rapid F - actin turn - over , and most depolymerize actin in a pH - dependent manner . Complexes of human and plant ADF with F - actin at different pH were examined using electron microscopy and a novel method of image analysis for helical ﬁlaments . Although ADF changes the mean twist of actin , we show that it does this by stabilizing a preexisting F - actin angular conformation . In addition , ADF induces a large ( z 12 8 ) tilt of actin subunits at high pH where ﬁlaments are readily disrupted . A second ADF molecule binds to a site on the opposite side of F - actin from that of the previously described ADF binding site , and this second site is only largely occupied at high pH . All of these states display a high degree of cooperativity that appears to be an integral part of F - actin . Key words : actin • ADF • cooperativity • electron mi - croscopy • image processing Introduction Actin dynamics play a major role in cell motility , cytokinesis , and endocytosis . The rapid polymerization / depolymerization of actin filaments in the cell , especially under the leading membrane edge , requires an efficient protein machinery that can provide a fast response to extracellular stimuli ( Chen et al . , 2000 ; Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . A large number of actin binding proteins have been shown to participate in the assembly , disassembly , and rearrangement of the cyto - skeleton . Proteins in the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) 1 / cofilin family are essential , conserved , and widespread actin depolymerizing factors that interact with F - actin in a strong cooperative manner ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ; Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) . All members of the ADF / cofilin family are small proteins that contain between 118 and 168 amino acids ( 13 – 19 kD ) , and most depolymerize actin more rapidly at higher pH ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ; Bernstein et al . , 2000 ) . The exceptions to this pH dependence are Acan - thamoeba actophorin ( Maciver et al . , 1998 ) and starfish depactin ( Bamburg et al . , 1999 ) . ADF and cofilin from a single organism share z 70 % sequence identity , whereas the difference between ADFs from different organisms is much higher ( Bamburg , 1999 ) . In this work , we used plant Acanthamoeba thaliana ADF1 ( p - ADF ) and human ADF ( h - ADF ) , molecules that share only 31 % identity . Two possible mechanisms of actin depolymerization were proposed for ADF / cofilin proteins . It was suggested that ADF depolymerizes actin due to a severing activity ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . Carlier ( 1998 ) proposed that the acceleration of treadmilling via the enhancement of the off - rate at the barbed end of the fil - ament by ADF / cofilin proteins is responsible for actin filament destabilization ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1997 ) . A combination of both mechanisms has also been sug - gested ( Theriot , 1997 ) , and the main question involves the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to actin filament shortening ( Du and Frieden , 1998 ; Moriyama and Yahara , 1999 ) . A growing body of evidence suggests that the geometry and internal dynamics of actin filaments might be func - tionally important in the interaction between F - actin and many actin - binding proteins . For example , in muscle , it has been shown using mutations ( Drummond et al . , 1990 ) , cross - linking ( Prochniewicz and Yanagida , 1990 ; Kim et al . , 1998 ) , and proteolysis ( Schwyter et al . , 1990 ) that mod - ifications can be made to F - actin that do not prevent the binding of myosin and do not inhibit the activation of my - osin’s ATPase activity but do prevent the generation of force . The variability in the structure of F - actin may be im - portant in this context . In an ideal actin filament , actin subunits are related to each other by an axial rise of 27 Å Address correspondence to Edward H .

This symmetry operation can gen - erate every subunit in a filament , given a single subunit . Because subunit n will be rotated z 26 8 from both subunits n 2 2 and n 1 2 , the resulting filament can also be de - scribed by a helix containing two z 700 - Å - pitch axially staggered strands that crossover in projection at average intervals of z 350 Å . However , early electron microscopic observations showed that the actual crossover points of negatively stained actin filaments were far from uniform in their length ( Hanson , 1967 ) . A subsequent model sug - gested that this arises from an unusual property of F - actin where subunits have the ability to rotate within the fila - ments , although the axial rise per subunit is quite fixed ( Egelman et al . , 1982 ) . It was proposed that this rotational variability of F - actin might help the cell to use a single highly conserved protein in several different structures . Human cofilin was observed to change the twist of actin by z 5 8 per subunit when it was bound stoichiometrically to F - actin ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) , and it was proposed that this change in actin symmetry was responsible for the de - stabilization of the actin filament . Later , using a mutant cofilin that bound to actin but did not destabilize the fila - ment , it was suggested that the change in twist induced by cofilin could be uncoupled from subunit dissociation ( Pope et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , there is no clear picture for the role of the change in actin’s twist in the mechanism of ADF / cofilin - induced actin depolymerization . We have used a new approach for image analysis of heli - cal filaments ( Egelman , 2000 ) to examine both pure actin filaments and complexes of F - actin with p - and h - ADF . This new approach allows us to analyze tens of thousands of short segments within filaments , without the need to as - sume a fixed helical symmetry for a long filament . This ap - proach is therefore sensitive to variations in helical sym - metry between different segments , as well as to differences in the occupancy of the ADF molecules bound to F - actin . Using this method , we show that segments of pure actin can be found in an ADF / cofilin - like state of twist in the absence of other proteins . Furthermore , the ADF – actin complex can exist with a twist close to that of the normal actin state . We find that under conditions where actin fila - ments are readily depolymerized , two molecules of ADF bind per actin subunit , and not one as has been believed previously . We also find that under these conditions of fil - ament destabilization some actin subunits undergo a large tilt from their positions in normal F - actin that causes the breakage of the longitudinal contacts within the actin fila - ment . These results provide new insight into the internal dynamics of F - actin , suggesting that they may be even larger in magnitude than previously imagined , and suggest that certain actin - binding proteins in the cell may have evolved to regulate these internal dynamics as part of cel - lular control of the cytoskeleton . Materials and Methods Protein Preparation and EM Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Strzelecka - Golaszewska et al . , 1980 ) and isolated as Ca 2 1 – G - actin by chromatography over a Super - dex - 200 column using the AKTA Explorer HPLC system ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . G – Ca 2 1 – actin was diluted to a final concentration of 0 . 5 mg / ml by 5 mM Pipes buffer , pH 6 . 5 , or 5 mM Tris buffer , pH 7 . 7 . Ca 2 1 was replaced with Mg 2 1 by incubating G - actin with 0 . 2 mM EGTA and 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 for 10 min at room temperature . G - actins were polymerized by 0 . 1 M KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 by incubating 2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 8 C . F - actins were spun down in a TLX - 120 tabletop ul - tracentrifuge ( Beckman Coulter ) , and pellets were homogenized in fresh F buffers ( 0 . 1 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 15 mM Tris buffer , pH 7 . 7 , or Pipes buffer , pH 6 . 5 ) and diluted to final concentrations of 2 – 4 m M . p - ADF ( Car - lier et al . , 1997 ) and h - ADF were a gift from Dr . M . - F . Carlier ( Laboratory of Enzymology and Structural Biochemistry , Gif - Sur - Yvette , France ) . ADFs were diluted by F buffers to final concentrations of 3 – 6 m M . Negatively stained samples were prepared by incubation for 10 min in tubes of 2 m M actin with 6 m M ADF or by decoration on the grid , where one drop ( 6 m l ) of 2 m M actin was applied to 300 - mesh copper grids coated with carbon for 1 min , and then two separate drops ( 6 m l each ) of 4 m M ADF were added for 30 s – 2 min . The grids were rinsed with two drops of 1 % uranyl acetate . Specimens were examined in a JEOL 1200 EX11 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV and a nominal magnification of 30 , 000 3 . Negatives were densitometered with a Leaf 45 scanner , using a raster of 4 Å / pixel . Image Analysis The references for initial multireference cross - correlation analysis were generated using layer lines extracted from an atomic model of the F - actin filament ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) . The symmetry of this model was changed by reindexing the layer lines ( from a 13 / 6 helix ) : l 5 0 , n 5 0 ; l 5 1 , n 5 2 ; l 5 2 , n 5 4 ; l 5 3 , n 5 6 ; l 5 4 , n 5 2 5 ; l 5 5 , n 5 2 3 ; l 5 6 , n 5 2 1 ; l 5 7 , n 5 1 ; l 5 8 , n 5 3 ; l 5 12 , n 5 2 2 ; l 5 13 , n 5 0 ; l 5 14 , n 5 2 . The subse - quent procedure for iterative helical real space reconstruction was as de - scribed ( Egelman , 2000 ) . Segments of pure F - actin and F - ADF – actin complexes were placed in 100 3 100 pixel boxes ( z 400 3 400 Å ) , and these were cross - correlated against reference projections using a real space radius of 42 pixels in the search . Thus , the cross - correlation search involved z 12 subunits . The search for helical symmetry within the asym - metric volume generated by back - projection involved nine subunits , elim - inating possible end effects that are present due to the geometry of the re - construction ( Egelman , 2000 ) . Typically , z 10 % of filament segments were excluded during the iterations , based on poor cross - correlations against the reference volumes . The resolution of the reconstructions was determined by generating two independent reconstructions from each data set after randomly dividing the images into two equal subsets . The correlation coefficients from each of these pairs of reconstructions was . 0 . 5 with a resolution of & 25 Å for the ADF – actin complexes and & 30 Å for both the pure and naked actin . Using the 3 s criterion ( Saxton and Baumeister , 1982 ) rather than the correlation coefficient , the estimate for resolution is z 20 Å for the ADF – actin complexes and z 25 Å for both the pure and naked actin . The cross - correlation procedure was used to discriminate ADF - bound and naked actin segments in a similar manner to that described for sorting by symmetry . We term actin “naked” when patches of undecorated actin are found within ADF - decorated actin filaments , in contrast to “pure” F - actin , which refers to actin filaments in the absence of any additional pro - teins . References were created by imposing a symmetry of 162 . 0 8 on the pure F - actin reconstruction as well as on the fully ADF - decorated F - actin to distinguish segments by the presence or absence of the ADF , rather than by symmetry . The reconstruction algorithm was then iterated many times in each cycle , eliminating those segments that had a poor cross - cor - relation coefficient against the continuously updated naked actin recon - struction . This was continued ( for 60 – 250 cycles ) until a stable solution was found with respect to both symmetry and the number of segments identified as naked actin . The validation of this sorting procedure was that reconstructions of segments from ADF - decorated filaments that were se - lected by higher cross - correlation against the pure F - actin reference than against the ADF – actin reference looked like undecorated actin . Surface thresholds were determined by using 125 % of the expected molecular volume of pure actin , and 100 % of the expected molecular vol - ume for both the 1 : 1 or 2 : 1 ADF – actin complexes , assuming a partial spe - cific volume of protein of 0 . 75 cm 3 / g . Fitting of Actin and ADF Monomer Structures The missing DNase - 1 binding loop was added to the actin structure ( Pro - tein Data Bank entry 1EQY ) as described ( Wriggers and Schulten , 1999 ) . h - ADF coordinates were obtained from PDB entry 1AK6 ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ) . The fitting of atomic models into EM reconstructions was car - on J une 6 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 2 , 2001 Galkin et al . ADF – Actin Complexes 77 ried out with the Situs package v1 . 4 ( Wriggers et al . , 1999 ) . The fitting method takes advantage of topology - representing neural networks that represent the shape features and three - dimensional density distribution of both atomic and low - resolution data by a discrete number of vectors ( Wriggers et al . , 1998 ) . It was shown that this docking approach recon - structs atomic models of undecorated actin filament structures with a pre - cision of one order of magnitude above the nominal resolution of the un - derlying low - resolution map ( Wriggers et al . , 1999 ) . The main innovation implemented in Situs v1 . 4 is the addition of distance constraints between adjacent vectors . The resulting distance - constrained vectors freeze the de - grees of freedom that are inessential for the docking and thereby provide robustness against the effects of noise and experimental uncertainty ( Wriggers and Birmanns , 2001 ) . Five vectors were used per actin subunit , and two vectors per ADF molecule . Helical boundary conditions were ap - plied . Since rigid body docking was performed , intramolecular distances ( derived from the atomic structures ) were constrained , using the SHAKE algorithm ( van Gunsteren and Berendsen , 1977 ) , whereas intermolecular distances remained free . The resulting vectors provided anchor points for a least squares fitting of individual molecules ( Wriggers et al . , 1998 ) . To test the fitting algorithm for the ADF - decorated volume , we com - pared the model resulting from a fit of G - actin to the ADF - decorated vol - ume with the Holmes model . The root mean square deviation of the re - sulting model from the symmetry corrected Holmes model was only 1 . 76 Å , demonstrating the reliability of the skeleton - based docking ap - proach . After the docking of actin , the resolution of the resulting F - actin model was lowered to 20 Å using the Situs pdblur utility ( Wriggers and Birmanns , 2001 ) . The amplitude of the simulated actin map was varied systematically to match the actin surface in the experimental map at like threshold levels . Subsequently , the simulated actin map was subtracted from the experimental data set . Single molecule densities of the primary and secondary ADF molecules were isolated with Situs as described ( Wriggers et al . , 1999 ) . Finally , the ADF structure was docked to the sin - gle molecule densities . There was a sixfold degeneracy in the vector rms deviation score for the primary ADF , but only one of the possible solu - tions was consistent with the biochemical information on the consensus binding interface with actin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ; Van Troys et al . , 1997 ; Ono et al . , 1999 ) . The shape - based docking was unambiguous in the case of the second ADF , and no biochemical data was used in this case to help orient the molecule . Results Rotational Variability of Pure F - Actin Allows It to Exist in the ADF / Cofilin - like Twist State The unusual twist previously reported for cofilin - deco - rated actin filaments ( changing F - actin from z 167 8 – 162 8 of rotation per subunit ) was observed at pH 6 . 6 where sta - ble filaments of actin – cofilin complex can be observed ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . At higher pH , cofilin will depoly - merize actin filaments more efficiently . To determine the distribution of filament twist for pure F - actin at low pH , we examined 10 , 800 segments of Mg 2 1 – F - actin polymer - ized at pH 6 . 5 . The frequency distribution of the images according to their twist ( Fig . 1 a ) is based on finding which of 27 reference filaments with angular rotations per sub - unit of 152 8 – 179 8 generates the highest cross - correlation when projections of the references are compared with the raw images . This distribution is extremely broad , and the dispersion has two components : the intrinsic variability of the twist of pure F - actin ( Egelman et al . , 1982 ) , and the poor signal - to - noise ratio present in segments of F - actin that contain only z 12 subunits . Model calculations show , as expected , that the dispersion in cross - correlation against references with different symmetries will increase as the signal - to - noise ratio is decreased . The iterative heli - cal real space reconstruction ( IHRSR ) method ( Egelman , 2000 ) , however , allows us to take subsets sorted as shown in Fig . 1 a and find if they yield a stable solution . The sub - sets from the far left ( , 156 8 ) and the far right ( . 170 8 ) of the distribution gave symmetries , after multiple iterations , that were either close to the central part of the distribution or had no stable solution . Thus , we can dismiss those out - lying symmetries as being due to errors in the initial sort - ing by twist because of noise or heterogeneity . The frequency distribution of stable solutions ( Fig . 1 b ) must be an underestimate of the dispersion of average twist of filament segments containing z 12 subunits . The reason that this is an underestimate is due to the way that these solutions have been obtained . We consider a solu - tion stable if we can show that it converges to a particular Figure 1 . Variability in twist of pure Mg 2 1 - actin at pH 6 . 5 . ( a ) The distribution of mean twist angles in 10 , 800 segments of Mg 2 1 - actin at pH 6 . 5 observed by multireference cross - correlation analysis . The 27 different references were generated by using 152 8 – 179 8 of rotation per subunit in a low - resolution version of an atomic model of the actin filament ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) . Each reference volume was rotated by 4 8 increments about the filament axis and projected onto a plane , to generate 90 images . These 2 , 430 ( 27 3 90 ) reference projections were used to sort the raw images by symmetry . ( b ) Final distribution of angles in Mg 2 1 - actin at pH 6 . 5 , based on stable solutions for subsets from distribution ( a ) found by the IHRSR method ( Egelman , 2000 ) . ( c ) The opera - tional definition of a stable solution is that subsets converge to the same solution for helical symmetry from different starting points . This is shown for the 158 8 and 166 8 subsets . on J une 6 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 2 , 2001 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 153 , 2001 78 helical symmetry independent of the starting point for the iterative procedure . Fig . 1 c illustrates this for two differ - ent subsets , 158 8 and 166 8 . It can be seen , for example , that the 158 8 solution is reached whether the iterations are started from a model having 151 . 5 8 , 162 8 , or 166 8 rotation per subunit . Similarly , the 166 8 solution is found whether the iterations start from 162 8 or 170 8 . Thus , we have high confidence that each stable solution corresponds to a real state for the average twist of 12 F - actin subunits , but we cannot exclude the possibility that other average states , further from the mean , actually exist . When the entire data set was combined , an overall symmetry of 166 . 1 8 was found . Keeping in mind that cofilin changes the mean twist of actin filaments to z 162 8 ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) , it can be seen ( Fig . 1 b ) that z 5 – 10 % of segments of pure F - actin can be found with a mean twist of 162 8 , or even 158 8 , without ADF / cofilin bound . Since the 158 8 state is so far from anything that has been described previously , we were interested to see if this was associated with filament ends , because the untwisting of actin was proposed as a mechanism of actin depolymerization ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . By selecting segments that were only close to fila - ment ends , we did not see any significant increase in the frequency of this state . Our results suggest that these seg - ments are randomly distributed within actin filaments . The three - dimensional reconstructions of pure actin from the 158 8 subset ( Fig . 2 a ) and from the 166 8 subset ( Fig . 2 c ) obtained by the IHRSR method have an obviously differ - ent twist . To exclude the possibility that this difference in twist is an artifact of the three - dimensional reconstruction Figure 2 . Reconstruction of two twist states of pure F - actin at pH 6 . 5 . Filament segments from the 158 8 sub - set ( a ; n 5 523 ) and the 166 8 subset ( c ; n 5 709 ) of Fig . 1 b have been reconstructed using IHRSR . The long - pitch actin helix in panel a undergoes a 180 8 rotation in 225 Å , whereas this helix undergoes the same rotation in 355 Å in ( c ) . Two - dimen - sional averages from these subsets are shown in b and d , where the large differences in cross - over spacings ( marked by bars ) can be easily seen . on J une 6 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 2 , 2001 Galkin et al . ADF – Actin Complexes 79 method , actin images from each of the two sets were aver - aged together . The resulting two - dimensional averages ( Fig . 2 , b and d ) have approximately the same difference in cross - over lengths , as can be seen in the three - dimensional recon - structions ( Fig . 2 , a and c ) . We have also used cryo - EM on unstained frozen - hydrated actin filaments and find a similar distribution of twist ( data not shown ) , excluding the possi - bility that the variation in twist is due to specimen prepara - tion . Thus , cofilin / ADF do not induce a new state of twist in F - actin , but either stabilize a particular state of twist in which pure actin can be found or shift the overall distribu - tion of twist by z 5 8 . The results below suggest that the former possibility is more likely . Symmetry of ADF – Actin Complexes h - ADF is more efficient at disrupting rabbit muscle actin filaments than is p - ADF , and this difference is more obvi - ous at high pH ( Ressad et al . , 1998 ) . We have therefore used incubations of p - and h - ADF with F - actin at both pH 6 . 5 and 7 . 7 ( Fig . 3 ) . We observed that h - ADF bound to F - actin at pH 6 . 5 more slowly than p - ADF ( Fig . 3 , com - Figure 3 . Electron micro - graphs of p - ( a , c , and e ) and h - ADF ( b , d , and f ) com - plexes with F - actin . F - actin was incubated for 2 min with p - ( a ) or h - ADF ( b ) on the EM grid at pH 6 . 5 for 2 min . F - actin was incubated in a tube for 10 min with p - ( c ) or h - ADF ( d ) at pH 6 . 5 .

After 2 min of incubation on the grid , fila - ments were fully decorated with p - ADF , but only partial decoration was noticed for h - ADF . Full occupancy was reached for h - ADF only after 10 min of incubation ( Fig . 3 d ) . There were no differences in EM pictures between p - ADF – decorated actin after 2 min incubation on the grid or 10 min incubation in tubes , except filaments were shorter after the longer incubation ( Fig . 3 , a and c ) . But h - ADF – decorated F - actin appeared quite different from p - ADF after 2 min incubation on the grid , as well as after 10 min incubation in tubes ( Fig . 3 , compare a , c , and d ) . Approxi - mately 30 % of filaments decorated with h - ADF appeared more massive and were stained more darkly ( Fig . 3 d , black arrow ) , and no such filaments were found in p - ADF samples . For h - ADF – actin filaments at pH 7 . 7 , z 70 % were darkly stained ( Fig . 3 f , black arrow ) , as opposed to z 30 % found at ph 6 . 5 ( Fig . 3 d , black arrow ) . No filaments containing regions of both dark and light staining were found . The pH 7 . 7 h - ADF – actin filaments were sorted into two subsets , based upon this staining , before subse - quent image analysis . Stable solutions were sought for p - ADF and h - ADF complexes with F - actin at both pH 6 . 5 and 7 . 7 , after the procedure described for pure F - actin , and these are shown in Fig . 4 a . Several contrasts exist with the distribution for pure F - actin ( Fig . 1 b ) . The means of the twist distribution for all ADF – actin complexes were z 162 8 , but segments of actin filaments decorated with ADF could also be found in states with an average twist of 164 8 – 165 8 , close to the nor - mal F - actin twist . The dispersion in the twist distributions is greatly reduced compared with pure F - actin , consistent with the notion that ADF may be preferentially stabilizing an existing state or states of F - actin out of several possible states . By combining all images from each group , rather than searching for subsets that yielded stable solutions , the overall symmetries all converged to z 162 8 , except for the p - ADF complex , pH 7 . 7 , where the average symmetry was z 163 8 . Reconstruction of the ADF – F - Actin Complexes by the Single Particle Approach Three - dimensional reconstructions were generated for dif - ferent subsets of the ADF – actin complexes using the IHRSR method ( Fig . 5 ) . To assist in interpreting the mass due to ADF , we have superimposed an ADF – actin , pH 6 . 5 , reconstruction ( Fig . 5 c ) on a pure F - actin reconstruc - tion ( Fig . 5 a ) , and the difference density in Fig . 5 b is very similar to what has previously been described for cofilin ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . The most striking difference with previous work , however , is the visualization of a second h - ADF molecule bound to a site on the opposite side of the actin subunit from the primary ADF . This second h - ADF can be seen partially in Fig . 5 d ( pH 6 . 5 ) and more fully in Fig . 5 f ( pH 7 . 7 ) . The second ADF was completely absent in the case of the lightly stained h - ADF , pH 7 . 7 , set ( Fig . 5 g ) . The difference in appearance of the second ADF be - tween Fig . 5 , d and f , could be due to the difference in binding modes of ADF at different pH . The dark and light staining of the h - ADF – actin filaments in the EM images ( Fig . 3 , d and f ) is due , therefore , to the presence or ab - sence , respectively , of a second ADF molecule bound to many actin subunits . A second ADF molecule is not apparent in the whole set reconstructions of p - ADF – actin complexes at either pH 6 . 5 or 7 . 7 ( Fig . 5 , c and e ) . We were able , however , to find traces of the second ADF molecule for the p - ADF complex at pH 7 . 7 . When a subset containing z 15 % of these images , isolated using cross - correlation procedures , was reconstructed , a weak density due to the second ADF was observed ( data not shown ) . This suggests that the sec - ond site is available for the p - ADF as well , but its occu - pancy is significantly lower than that of h - ADF . Binding of ADF Induces a Change in the Tilt of the Actin Subunit It has been shown that the binding of ADF ( Hayden et al . , 1993 ; Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Ressad et al . , 1998 ) and cofilin ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) to F - actin is a cooperative process .

( b ) All ADF – actin sets converge to a symmetry of z 162 8 in the IHRSR approach , except the p - ADF – actin complex at pH 7 . 7 , which has a twist of z 163 8 . The stability of solutions in the IHRSR appli - cation to ADF – actin complexes is shown for the p - ADF – actin complex at pH 6 . 5 , which converges from both 158 8 and 166 8 starting points to a twist of 162 8 . on J une 6 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 2 , 2001 Galkin et al .

Overall , the disruption of the longitudinal contacts within the actin filaments may be the most important fac - tor in destabilization of the filament as a result of this tilt of the actin subunit . Constructing an Atomic Model of F - Actin with Two ADFs Bound per Subunit We have shown that heterogeneity can exist within the ADF – actin filaments due to variations in twist , the pres - ence of undecorated actin segments , as well as the pres - ence of one or two ADF molecules per actin subunit . We have attempted to eliminate much of this heterogeneity within the set of h - ADF – actin filaments at pH 7 . 7 and have generated a reconstruction from 2 , 116 segments found in the center of the twist distribution ( 162 8 ) that show homogeneity with the respect of having two mole - cules of h - ADF bound per actin subunit ( Fig . 7 a ) . The second ADF bound was also present in other subsets . Be - cause of the greater homogeneity of this set , both the sec - ond ADF and actin are more clearly defined than in the reconstruction of the whole set ( Fig . 5 f ) . Using this vol - ume , it was possible to determine the approximate binding site for the second ADF on actin , and the resulting atomic model is shown in Fig . 7 b . According to our rigid body fit - ting ( assuming no conformational changes in either G - actin or ADF ) , we predict that residues 22 – 25 , 139 – 148 , and 340 – 355 of the upper actin subunit and residues 28 – 29 , 44 – Figure 5 . Reconstructed surfaces of h - and p - ADF – actin complexes at pH 6 . 5 and 7 . 7 . All reconstructions were generated by the IHRSR approach . A reconstruction of pure actin ( a ) was subtracted from the reconstruction of p - ADF – actin complex at pH 6 . 5 ( c ) to generate the density in blue in b due to the primary ADF . This is marked by a green arrow ( b and c ) . The h - ADF – actin complex at pH 6 . 5 ( d ) , p - ADF – actin complex at pH 7 . 7 ( e ) , h - ADF – actin darkly stained filaments at pH 7 . 7 ( f ) , and h - ADF – actin lightly stained filaments at pH 7 . 7 ( g ) are shown . A red arrow marks the position of the second ADF molecule bound , and it can be seen that this second molecule is present at low occupancy at pH 6 . 5 ( d ) and at higher occupancy at pH 7 . 7 ( f ) . The difference in appearance of this additional density between d and f ( red arrows ) is due to a different contact with the F - actin , as well as a difference in occupancy . However , the center of this additional density falls approximately in the same place for both structures . Because this cooperativity could be transmitted through F - actin itself ( Orlova et al . , 1995 ) , we were interested to look at regions of the ADF – actin complexes that were ei - ther undecorated by ADF or only partially decorated . Us - ing cross - correlation methods ( Materials and Methods ) , we found that z 15 % of filament segments used in our re - constructions of ADF – actin ( Fig . 5 ) were more similar to pure actin than ADF – actin . We refer to these segments within ADF - decorated filaments as naked actin . After this initial sorting , traces of the second but not the first ADF molecule could still be seen ( data not shown ) . We used ad - ditional sorting procedures , based on iterative cycles of re - construction and exclusion of images , to isolate segments of ADF – actin filaments that contained mainly undeco - rated actin to use in the naked actin reconstructions ( Fig . 6 ) . Each of these subsets had a mean twist similar to that of the entire ADF – actin complexes , consistent with the notion that the change in twist is propagated in the actin filament beyond the subunits bound by ADF ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) . However , we were not able to deter - mine the length over which this change in twist persists . Most importantly , the actin subunits within such naked re - gions are observed to be in a different orientation than they are in pure F - actin . The subunits at pH 6 . 5 ( Fig . 6 , a and b ) and 7 . 7 ( Fig . 6 , c and d ) rotate in opposite direc - tions relative to the Holmes model ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) by z 6 8 and z 12 8 , respectively . This is observed both for h - ( Fig . 6 , b and d ) and p - ADF ( Fig . 6 , a and c ) . As a control , no significant tilt or shift was found when we compared the position of the actin subunits in our reconstructions of pure actin at pH 6 . 5 and 7 . 7 with the Holmes model . Atomic models , using rigid body rotations , illustrate this rotation in Fig . 6 , e and f . This large change in the tilt of on J une 6 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 2 , 2001 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 153 , 2001 82 50 , and 88 – 101 of the lower actin subunit ( Fig . 7 c ) take part in the interaction with the primary ADF molecule . The second ADF molecule does not exhibit strong con - tacts with actin , although there are near contacts with the actin COOH terminus at helix 359 – 364 and with helix 112 – 126 ( Fig . 7 , b and c ) . One possibility is that even after sort - ing images by twist to obtain a homogeneous population , these images had a partial second ADF occupancy that caused a weakening of the density of the second ADF molecule in the reconstruction . It has been suggested that the actin COOH terminus is flexible ( Owen and De - Rosier , 1993 ; Orlova and Egelman , 1995 ) , and it is con - ceivable that small conformational changes of exposed loops and side chains help mediate the contacts between the second bound ADF and F - actin . Discussion Variable Twist of F - Actin It has long been noted that F - actin exhibits a natural varia - tion in crossover spacing ( Hanson , 1967 ) . An angular dis - order model for this variability was proposed , where the possibility that actin monomers could rotate z 10 8 from their ideal helical positions was predicted ( Egelman et al . , 1982 ) . McGough and colleagues ( 1997 ) showed that a pro - tein of the ADF / cofilin family changed the mean twist of actin filaments by z 5 8 per subunit . Initially , it was sug - gested that changing the twist of actin might cause depoly - merization of filaments via a weakening of the longitudi - nal bonds within the filament , specifically a breaking of the contact between subdomain 2 of the lower subunit with subdomain 1 of the upper subunit in the same long - pitch helix ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . It was subsequently shown that , in certain conditions , cofilin disrupted lateral contacts in the actin filament ( McGough and Chiu , 1999 ) . Most recently , using a mutant cofilin that changes the twist of actin filaments and fragments them , but does not depo - lymerize them , it was proposed that the change of twist by itself is not responsible for the enhanced rate of actin sub - unit dissociation ( Pope et al . , 2000 ) . So the relationship be - tween the change of twist induced by ADF / cofilin and fila - ment destabilization remains unclear . In the this work , we used a single particle approach for the analysis of helical structures ( Egelman , 2000 ) . The main advantage of this method is the ability to analyze short F - actin segments containing z 12 subunits , without needing to impose a uniform helical symmetry on a long filament . This has allowed us to address many issues of heterogeneity in both the twist of F - actin and the binding by ADF that have not been possible using conventional methods . We found that segments of F - actin by itself , without ADF / cofilin proteins , could exist in the state of 162 8 twist observed for cofilin - decorated F - actin . Remark - ably , we were able to find z 8 % of the segments that had a mean twist of 158 8 , a change by z 8 8 per subunit from the mean twist of the whole set . We have suggested that the variability in twist within actin filaments is not continuous , but rather that subunits might exist in only a few discrete states ( Orlova and Egelman , 2000 ) . This model predicts a relatively static disorder , rather than the thermal torsional motions predicted by a continuous variability of twist . Al - though at this point we do not have any information about the number of such discrete states , or their distribution , our observation of many segments having a mean twist of z 158 8 suggests several points . It is likely that one state of twist is z 158 8 . Another conclusion is that there must be a Figure 6 . Reconstructions of naked actin from h - and p - ADF – actin complexes at pH 6 . 5 and 7 . 7 . Within actin filaments deco - rated with ADF , many segments can be found that appear to contain very little or no ADF . The rendered surfaces generated by IHRSR for such naked actin from p - ADF complex pH 6 . 5 ( a ) , h - ADF complex , pH 6 . 5 ( b ) , p - ADF complex , pH 7 . 7 ( c ) , and h - ADF complex , pH 7 . 7 ( d ) are shown . Subdomains 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 of the actin subunit are labeled , and these domains are labeled as 1 9 , 2 9 , 3 9 , and 4 9 on the next subunit along the same long - pitch helical strand . The normal density between subdomain 4 of one subunit and subdomain 3 on an adjacent actin monomer is present at pH 6 . 5 ( a , red arrow ) , but absent at pH 7 . 7 ( d , red arrow ) . G - actin subunits were fit ( Materials and Methods ) to naked F - actin densities from h - ADF set at pH 6 . 5 ( e ) and from h - ADF set at pH 7 . 7 ( f ) . Two adjacent subunits from the symmetry - corrected model of F - actin ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) are shown in cyan as a reference , whereas the fitted structures are shown in brown . Black arrows indicate the tilt of actin subunits away from the position in the Holmes model . The models ( e and f ) were visualized with the molecular graphics program VMD ( Humphrey et al . , 1996 ) . on J une 6 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 2 , 2001 Galkin et al . ADF – Actin Complexes 83 cooperativity in twist within the filament , so that the prob - ability of a subunit having a particular twist is dependent on the twist of adjacent subunits . If twist states were ran - domly distributed , we would expect to see a nearly Gauss - ian distribution for the mean twist of 12 subunits ( from the central limit theorem ) , and we clearly do not ( Fig . 1 b ) . At - tempting to describe the actin filament in terms of a Markov model of twist probabilities dependent on the twist of adjacent subunits must still wait for more detailed information . When the IHRSR method is applied to ADF – actin com - plexes , we observe a large reduction in the variability of twist of these filaments when compared with pure F - actin filaments . Consistent with what we observe for pure F - actin , we suggest that ADF / cofilin proteins stabilize an already existing state of twist of the actin filament rather than imposing a new one . Two Molecules of ADF per Actin Subunit Also , we have been able to see that one component of variability in the binding of ADF to actin is due to whether one ADF molecule or two bind per actin subunit . The dis - tribution of these two possibilities is different between the h - and p - ADF . Under similar conditions at pH 7 . 7 , the h - ADF – actin complex segments are more likely to be found in the 2 : 1 stoichiometry of binding than the p - ADF – actin complex . ADF / cofilin proteins from different sources have differ - ent depolymerizing activities and for the majority of these proteins this activity is pH dependent ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ) . The rate of actin depolymerization also depends on the isoform of actin . It was reported that UNC - 60B from Caenorhabditis elegans disrupted C . elegans F - actin more efficiently than it disrupted rabbit muscle actin ( Ono et al . , Figure 7 .

Numbers of residues that are involved in the interaction with ADF are indicated . on J une 6 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 2 , 2001 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 153 , 2001 84 1999 ) . On the other hand , Acanthamoeba actophorin de - polymerizes rabbit F - actin faster than it depolymerizes Acanthamoeba actin ( Maciver et al . , 1998 ) . h - ADF is more efficient in disrupting rabbit muscle actin filaments than is p - ADF ( Ressad et al . , 1998 ) . To look at the structural ba - sis for these differences , as well as to understand the mech - anism of filament destabilization , we investigated h - and p - ADF – actin complexes with F - actin at high and low pH . One of the most important observations was the presence of a second ADF molecule bound to actin filaments . This can be easily observed with h - ADF at pH 7 . 7 , when ADF is active in filament destabilization , but is also present more weakly with p - ADF at the same pH . We suggest that the greater efficiency observed for h - ADF compared with p - ADF in depolymerizing actin ( Ressad et al . , 1998 ) is due to the higher affinity of h - ADF for occupying the second binding site on actin . We were able to sort filament images containing the second ADF bound at the level of the raw micrographs , due to the different staining of these fila - ments ( Fig . 3 , d and f ) . The absence of filaments contain - ing long regions with both light and dark staining suggests a large cooperativity in the binding of the second ADF molecule that extends over an entire filament . This is simi - lar to what has previously been observed in the binding of heavy meromyosin to actin ( Orlova and Egelman , 1997 ) . Although the binding of two ADF molecules per actin subunit has not been previously described , it is not incon - sistent with previous observations . A stoichiometry of 1 . 3 : 1 for the interaction of h - ADF with rabbit F - actin at pH 6 . 5 was observed ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . This is consis - tent with our reconstruction for this complex in which only traces of the second ADF can be seen ( Fig . 5 d ) . It was postulated ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) that there is no interac - tion between h - ADF and F - actin at pH higher than 7 . 5 , where we can observe the 2 : 1 stoichiometry of binding more fully . But this is also consistent with our EM obser - vations , since after 10 min of incubation there is no F - actin left because of the high depolymerizing activity of ADF at this pH . Even during a short incubation time ( 4 min on the grid ) at pH 7 . 7 , ADF was able to depolymerize approxi - mately half of the F - actin ( with a total actin concentration of 2 m M ) , and only short fully occupied filaments were ob - served by EM . The second binding site for ADF is also in agreement with biochemical observations , even though many of the molecular details of the ADF – cofilin interaction with actin are still unknown . Using biochemical and genetic ap - proaches , several sites on actin were predicted to be im - portant for the interaction between these proteins . Chemi - cal cross - linking was used to propose that residues 1 – 12 on actin’s NH 2 terminus and residues 357 – 375 on the COOH terminus were involved in the interaction with the homol - ogous starfish protein depactin ( Sutoh and Mabuchi , 1986 , 1989 ) . It was shown that residues 334 – 336 , 290 – 292 , 326 , and 328 of actin could be involved in the interaction with cofilin in yeast ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . It was also suggested that residues 75 – 105 and 112 – 125 of rabbit muscle actin might interact with human cofilin ( Renoult et al . , 1999 ) . The previously determined low resolution structure of the actin – cofilin filament displayed only general agreement with these data and predicted that residues 143 – 149 , 345 – 346 , 349 – 351 , and 354 of the actin upper monomer and res - idues 21 , 28 , 36 – 38 , 40 – 43 , 49 – 54 , 57 , 61 , 87 – 88 , 90 – 96 , and 101 of the lower monomer were involved in the interaction with cofilin . Since the helix containing residues 112 – 125 in actin is on the opposite side of the actin subunit from the position of the bound cofilin observed by McGough et al . ( 1997 ) , a model of “intercalated” binding was proposed by Renoult et al . ( 1999 ) . The COOH terminus of actin , sug - gested to be involved in the binding of ADF / cofilin pro - teins ( Sutoh and Mabuchi , 1986 ) , is also on the opposite side of the actin subunit . Our visualization of a second ADF bound to actin in the region of both helix 112 – 125 and the COOH terminus reconciles these observations , without needing to greatly change the mode of binding of the first ADF molecule from that described by McGough et al . ( 1997 ) . We suggest several reasons why a second cofilin mole - cule was not seen in previous EM studies of actin – cofilin complexes ( McGough et al . , 1997 ; McGough and Chiu , 1999 ; Pope et al . , 2000 ) . First , platelet F - actin was used in those studies , whereas we used rabbit muscle actin . As mentioned above , the isoform of actin can strongly influ - ence the biochemical characteristics of the ADF – actin in - teraction . Platelet F - actin is more resistant to the depoly - merization activity of human cofilin than rabbit F - actin . When rabbit F - actin was used after 30 – 90 - min incubation on ice , they observed only short actin filaments that were useless in helical approaches ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . Sec - ond , the model for the cofilin – F - actin complex proposed by McGough et al . ( 1997 ) was based on experiments per - formed at pH 6 . 5 , when this complex is stable . We observed the second molecule predominantly at pH 7 . 7 , where actin is more easily deploymerized . Third , human cofilin shares only 70 % homology with h - ADF ( Bamburg , 1999 ) and could have a lower affinity for the second binding site . Variable Tilt of Actin Subunits Under conditions where F - actin is readily destabilized by h - ADF ( pH 7 . 7 ) , we can observe segments of naked actin where the subunits have undergone a large ( z 12 8 ) tilt from their position in normal F - actin . This tilt appears to break the longitudinal bounds in the long - pitch helices . Since this tilt is much more striking in these naked seg - ments than in the fully decorated F - actin , either this con - formation occurs after ADF binds and dissociates from these regions or is induced by the binding of ADF to neighboring subunits . The possibility of a variable tilt of the actin subunit within the filament has been raised previ - ously ( Egelman and DeRosier , 1983 ; Tilney et al . , 1983 ) . In stereocilia of the inner ear , it was suggested that the ability of actin subunits to tilt by z 10 8 could explain the tilting of cross - bridges between actin filaments observed when these bundles bend ( Tilney et al . , 1983 ) . Although actin filaments in muscle only undergo an extension of z 0 . 08 Å per subunit on average when full tension is in - duced ( Huxley et al . , 1994 ; Wakabayashi et al . , 1994 ) , rela - tively large axial perturbations of mass within F - actin can be seen by both x - ray diffraction ( Lednev and Popp , 1990 ) and EM ( Egelman and DeRosier , 1983 ) when filaments are packed into bundles . It was estimated that these dis - placements in axially projected mass could be roughly 6 3 Å ( Egelman and DeRosier , 1983 ) , and the suggestion was made that a variable tilt of the subunits could recon - on J une 6 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 2 , 2001 Galkin et al . ADF – Actin Complexes 85 cile such displacements with the relatively fixed average axial spacing . A comparison between our model for a sub - unit with a 12 8 tilt and the Holmes model ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) shows that the axially projected mass distribution would shift by z 4 Å between the two . It is striking that the magnitude of the tilt previously predicted , in both angular range and projected axial shift , is quite similar to what we now observe . It was proposed that the untwisting of actin by cofilin could disrupt the contacts between subdomain 2 of the lower subunit and subdomain 1 of the upper one , thus de - stabilizing the actin filament ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . The large tilt of the actin subunits is induced by ADF under conditions where filaments are readily depolymerized , and this tilt appears to make even greater changes in actin sub - unit – subunit contacts within the filament . Specifically , a large contact between subdomain 4 of one subunit and subdomain 3 of the subunit above is broken . We think it likely that this disruption of the normal structure of F - actin could be responsible for the destabilization of the filament and lead to either filament breakage , if it occurs , within filaments or subunit dissociation , if it occurs , at the ends of filaments . Conclusions The variable twist of F - actin allows segments of filaments to randomly exist in the same state of twist induced by ADF / cofilin in the absence of these proteins . The bind - ing of ADF to actin causes cooperative changes in both F - actin tilt and twist to be propagated to actin subunits that are undecorated . The binding of two molecules of ADF per actin subunit reconciles previous biochemical observations with structural models . The depolymeriza - tion activity of ADF / cofilin may be due to both changes in the tilt and twist of actin subunits , and this may occur mainly after two molecules of ADF are bound per actin .
