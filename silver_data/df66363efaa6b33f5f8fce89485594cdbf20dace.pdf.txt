S . POLITICAL BEHAVIOR CLEM BROOKS Indiana University , Bloomington One of the most widely debated issues in contemporary sociology has been how to interpret patterns offamily change in the United States during the past four de - cades . Much of these debates focus on a thesis advanced by a number of scholars and political activists - that such features offamily structure as high divorce rates and an increasing proportion of single - parent families have led to the decline of the family . Although past research has examined the causes and historical trends in - volved in family change , scholars have neglected important questions about family attitudes that have been raised in recent debates . Have levels of public concern with family decline increased over time ? If so , what are the sources of these attitudes ? And have changing levels of public concern with family decline led to the emergence of a new political cleavage ? This study applies a theory of religious influence to answer these questions . Results show that public concern with family decline in - creased steadily after 1980 , leading to a new and increasingly large cleavage in presidential elections . The analyses also find that high levels of concern with family decline are concentrated among evangelical Protestants who attend church regu - larly . In addition to extending sociological research on family change in new and fruitful directions , these results bear productively on theory and research in political sociology and the sociology of religion . I discuss their relevance to long - standing debates over political trends among evangelical Protestants and the influence of Christian Right movement organizations . QO NE OF THE MOST widely debated issues in contemporary sociology has been how to interpret patterns of family change in the United States during the past four decades .

AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW , 2002 , VOL . 67 ( APRIL : 191 - 21 1 ) 191 1 92 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW have been widely debated in contemporary sociology . Although far from achieving resolution , scholarly debates over family decline have usefully highlighted the role of married women ' s declining fertility in explaining the growing proportion of children born into single - parent households ( Bane and Jargowsky 1988 ; Luker 1996 ) , the relevance of long - term historical trends in family struc - ture and divorce ( Cherlin 1988 ; Furstenberg 1998 ; Greeley 1991 ; Spain and Bianchi 1996 ) , and the mediating role of public poli - cies that provide for the welfare of women and children ( Lichter 1997 ; Skolnick 1991 ; Strober and Dornbusch 1988 ) . However , questions relating to public attitudes toward family decline have been neglected . The fo - cus of research on demographic or economic aspects of family change ( e . g . , structure , fer - tility , and marital dissolution ) has not been complemented by investigations of attitudes toward family decline in the United States . This lack of research is significant on two counts . First , while some proponents of the fam - ily decline thesis hypothesize a growing public concern with family decline ( Popenoe 1993 ; Wilson 1993 ) , they provide no direct evidence . Second , it is likely that changes in family structure are not isomorphic with re - spect to ( subjective ) changes in attitudes and perceptions . If public attitudes toward the is - sue of family decline have consequences for the behavior of individuals or the organiza - tion of institutions independently of the in - fluence of demographic and economic fac - tors , their cultural or political meanings are worthy of detailed study . In this study , I seek to extend research on family change to address questions about public attitudes . I emphasize that my goal is not to adjudicate ongoing debates over the effects of family change on the welfare of members or the stability of the institution . Instead , my focus is on the subjective di - 1 Four major symposia on family change have been published in social scientific journals : Jour - nal of Family Issues ( 1987 , vol . 8 , pp . 347 - 476 ) ; Journal of Marriage and the Family ( 1993 , vol . 55 , pp . 23 - 38 ; and vol . 55 , pp . 527 - 55 ) ; and Contemporary Sociology ( 1998 , vol . 27 , pp . 223 - 37 ) . mensions of family change . I ask the follow - ing questions : ( 1 ) Are there trends in the level of public concern with family decline ? ( 2 ) What are the causal sources of concern with family decline ? ( 3 ) Have changing lev - els of concern over family decline led to the emergence of a new political cleavage ? I apply a theory of religious influence to answer these questions . In addition to ex - tending sociological research on family change in new and fruitful directions , my results bear on theory and research in politi - cal sociology and the sociology of religion . In the paper ' s first section , I develop a more precise conceptualization of the phe - nomenon of family decline , considering four elements discussed by proponents of the thesis . I then discuss a theoretical ap - proach to religious influence that identifies causal processes which potentially explain the rise and partisan political relevance of public concern with family decline . After discussing data , measures , and models , I present the analyses . The broader signifi - cance of the results is discussed in greater detail in conclusion . THEORIZING SOURCES AND CONSEQUENCES OF FAMILY DECLINE CONCERN THE CONCEPT OF FAMILY DECLINE What are the components of family decline in the United States ? Proponents of the fam - ily decline thesis identify four social pro - cesses as indicators of the hypothesized de - cline of the family . DIVORCE . The growing rate of marital dissolution from the 1960s through the early 1980s is widely viewed as central to the hy - pothesized decline of the family . Divorce is said to have negative effects on the stability of the nuclear family , leading to social prob - lems such as single - parent families and in - adequate child socialization . Underlying these concerns is the preeminent value that most proponents of the family decline thesis assign to the ideas of lifelong marriage and continuity in families ( e . g . , Dobson and Bauer 1990 ; Popenoe 1994 ) . SINGLE - PARENT FAMILIES . A second in - dicator of family decline is the prevalence of single - parent families . Proponents of the RELIGION AND CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE 193 family decline thesis view this family form as less viable than the traditional two - parent institution on economic and oftentimes nor - mative grounds ( e . g . , Blankenhorn 1995 ; Murray 1993 ; Whitehead 1993 ) . Policy pro - posals relating to changes in tax and divorce laws are often linked to the assumption that single - parent families are a major social problem to be addressed through govern - ment or legal reforms . CHILDREN ' S SOCIALIZATION . Many pro - ponents of the family decline thesis argue that children ' s socialization is less adequate than in the past , leading to social problems such as juvenile crime and poor school per - formance ( Whitehead 1993 ) . Inadequate child socialization is frequently viewed as a product of rising rates of divorce and a growing number of single - parent families ( Gill 1997 ; Reed 1996 ) , suggesting causal connections between these elements of fam - ily decline . CHILD POVERTY . Finally , proponents of the family decline thesis often view the eco - nomic welfare of children as linked to changes in family structure . Like children ' s socialization , child poverty is often hypoth - esized as both causing and being caused by other components of family decline such as single parenthood ( Whitehead 1993 ; Wilson 1993 ) . Some commentators identify child poverty as part of an hypothesized cycle of marital dissolution , inadequate child social - ization , and single - parenthood ( Murray 1993 ) . RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE THEORY Compared with other Western democracies , the United States continues to be character - ized by exceptionally high levels of religious commitment and religious - organizational strength ( Ladd 1999 ; Sherkat and Ellison 1999 ; Verba , Schlozman , and Brady 1995 , chap . 17 ) . Religion shapes individuals ' atti - tudes toward family and gender ( Thornton 1985 ) , and studies have found that denomi - national membership , church attendance , and belief in specific doctrines have large effects on behaviors associated with social - ization style , fertility , and the division of do - mestic work ( Burns , Schlozman , and Verba 2001 , chap . 9 ; Sherkat and Ellison 1999 ; Woodberry and Smith 1998 ) . Causal assumptions regarding the likely effects of religion on family processes and attitudes constitute a theory of religious in - fluence . This general theoretical approach provides a potential means of understanding the mechanisms behind changing levels of concern with family decline . Recent analyti - cal innovations have advanced the sociology of religion by identifying three distinct mechanisms transmitting the influence of re - ligion . The first influence is denominational mem - bership . Affiliation with a denomination pro - vides individuals with a source of established ideas , authority , and organization ( Steens - land et al . 2000 ; Wuthnow 1999 ) . Compared with the social liberalism of mainline Protes - tant denominations , specific features of evangelical Protestantism - higher levels of belief in biblical inerrancy , a greater willing - ness to view the family as a sacred institu - tion , and broader support for traditional gen - der roles ( Wald 1996 ; Woodberry and Smith 1998 ) - may predispose evangelicals to be concerned with family decline . 2 Such factors are likely to result in significant differences in levels of concern with family decline among members of different religious tradi - tions , and especially among members of evangelical versus non - evangelical denomi - nations . A second way in which religion may in - fluence concern with family decline is through variable rates of church attendance . All religious institutions communicate ex - plicit normative recommendations about family behavior and organization ( Stevens 2001 ; Thornton 1985 ) . Attendance at reli - gious services exposes individuals to reli - gious communication involving clergy ( and other attenders ) , while also establishing so - cial networks in which such ideas are rein - forced ( Burs , Schlozman , and Verba 2001 , chap . 3 ; Wald , Owen , and Hill 1988 ) . If level of exposure to any religious communication is the main factor at work , it will be church attendance rather than denominational mem - 2 Sherkat and Ellison ( 1997 ) find that religious teachings associated with specific denominations ( such as biblical inerrancy among conservative Protestants or evangelicals ) can provide a source of cognitive structure which subsequently affects attitudes on specific issues . 194 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW bership that accounts for concern with fam - ily decline . A third way in which religion may lead to a concern with family decline is through ex - posure to denomination - specific influences . Thus the content of religious communication may vary across denominational families , leading to exposure to different types of re - ligious influence . Qualitative differences be - tween denominations in the content of com - munication are central to U . S . religious in - stitutions ( Regnerus , Sikkink , and Smith 1999 ; Woodberry and Smith 1998 ) . Guided by recent findings regarding the social cohe - siveness and moral conservatism of evan - gelical Protestants ( Wald , Owen , and Hill 1990 ; Wilcox forthcoming ) , I evaluate the hypothesis that regular participation in evan - gelical churches leads to higher levels of concern with family decline . This scenario would be empirically manifested in a signifi - cant interaction of church attendance x evan - gelical Protestant , suggesting that evangeli - cal churches facilitate higher levels of con - cern with family decline . The theory of religious influence is consis - tent with findings that any of the preceding three causal mechanisms explain public con - cern with family decline . However , a finding that none of these mechanisms affects levels of public concern with family decline would make religious influence theory irrelevant . The results of the analyses provide evidence for the causal relevance of specific religious factors , thus advancing our understanding of religious influence with respect to issues and conflicts relating to family change . POLITICAL BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS ? A general expectation of the theoretical work on religious influence is that by shaping po - litically relevant attitudes and identities , re - ligion indirectly influences political behav - ior ( Regnerus et al . 1999 ; Wald 1996 ; Woodberry and Smith 1998 ) . Does public concern with family decline affect U . S . vot - ing behavior ? Such a relationship could af - fect patterns of political party conflict and national policymaking . If this relationship persists over time , and if level of concern with family decline is shaped by ( religious ) group identities stemming from different in - terests or ideological orientations ( Franklin , Mackie , and Valen 1992 ; Lipset and Rokkan 1967 ; Manza and Brooks 1999 ) , this pro - vides evidence of a cleavage that separates voters into distinct partisan camps . As sug - gested by the case of race ( Carmines and Stimson 1989 ) , cleavages also can routinize social conflicts by identifying clear stakes for individuals and groups , and by provid - ing regular opportunities for the pursuit of group interests . Has such a cleavage emerged in the con - temporary United States ? Several studies suggest that voters perceive differences be - tween the Democratic and Republican par - ties on issues relating to family change ( Freeman 1993 ; Hammond , Shibley , and Solow 1994 ; Stacey 1994 ) . While no study has analyzed the effects of attitudes toward family decline on voting behavior , these studies provide grounds for considering the possibility of such effects over the relatively long time period from 1972 to 1996 . A pat - tern of increasing effects would provide evi - dence of a cleavage that adds to our under - standing of new sources of voter alignments and party conflict in American politics . Fur - ther details are discussed below . DATA , MEASURES , AND MODELS Guided by the theory of religious influence , my analyses address three questions : ( 1 ) Have levels of public concern with family decline changed over time ? ( 2 ) What factors , relating especially to religion , lead to high levels of concern with family decline ? ( 3 ) Do these attitudes affect voting behavior , leading to a new political cleavage ? By an - swering these questions , I develop a compre - hensive analysis of the nature , sources , and political consequences of public concern with family decline in the United States . DATA I analyze data from the National Election Studies ' ( NES ) surveys of voting behavior in U . S . national elections ( Center for Political Studies 1972 - 1996 ) . The NES surveys rep - resent very high - quality data on public atti - tudes , sociodemographic attributes , and vot - ing behavior . Items measuring attitudes to - ward family decline over time are very scarce , and the NES surveys represent the RELIGION AND CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE 195 only data of which I am aware that permit measurement of both voting behavior and public concern with family decline . The analyses span the years from 1972 through 1996 , encompassing the period dur - ing which concern with family decline has been hypothesized to increase . Because spe - cific control variables are available in select surveys , the analyses are presented in three stages . Each stage corresponds to one of the three research questions and involves a data set extracted from the NES surveys . In all three data sets , year itself is a variable , en - abling hypotheses about time trends to be directly tested . MEASURING PUBLIC CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE In six of the seven presidential election years between 1972 and 1996 , the NES asked re - spondents the following open - ended ques - tion : " What do you think are the most im - portant problems facing this country ? Of those you ' ve mentioned , what would you say is the single most important problem the country faces ? " The 1980 election survey used a modified version of this question . 3 I use the conceptualization discussed in the preceding section to identify responses that indicate a concern with family decline , assigning a score of " 1 " to respondents who mention one of the following problems : ( 1 ) family decline ; ( 2 ) divorce rates or the in - stability of families ; ( 3 ) single - parenthood or nonmarital births ; ( 4 ) the inadequate so - cialization of children ; and ( 5 ) references to child poverty that link it to one of the four preceding processes . All other respondents who were asked the NES question are as - signed a score of " 0 " ( see Table 1 ) . Because of its explicit reference to the " most important problem , " the NES item en - ables measurement of the theoretical concept of public concern with family decline . 4 The 3 The question in 1980 was : " What do you per - sonally feel are the most important problems the government in Washington should try to take care of ? " This difference in question wording has no significant impact on the analyses . 4 Past research on social problems ( Best 1995 ; Gusfield 1989 ) , including experimental survey research ( Iyengar and Kinder 1987 ; see Kinder 1998 for review ) , provides evidence for the as - requirement that individuals rank family de - cline as the most important problem discour - ages casual mentions of family decline , re - ducing the possibility of Type I errors . Type II errors ( i . e . , underestimating the true ex - tent of concern with family decline ) cannot be ruled out . However , given this study ' s fo - cus on over - time processes , the latter sce - nario is of limited consequence as there is no reason to assume that such errors are cor - related with time . RELIGION VARIABLES The first stage of the analyses ( Table 1 ) ana - lyzes the over - time pattern and sources of public concern with family decline , 5 focus - ing on the three religion factors associated with my theoretical approach to understand - ing religious influence . Building from recent work on denominations ( Steensland et al . 2000 ) , I measure religious group member - ship using dummy variables for evangelical Protestants , mainline Protestants , black Prot - estants , Catholics , Jews , those with no reli - gion , and respondents in other religions . ( A table listing the denominations included in each of these categories is available from the author ; also see Steensland et al . 2000 , app . ) 6 The second religion variable mea - sures frequency of church attendance , and it has six ordered categories ranging from don ' t attend ( 1 ) to attend every week ( 6 ) . The third type of religious factor is mea - sured using a series of religion x attendance interactions ( additional details are discussed in the results section ) . sumption that mentions of social problems are valid measures of the level of salience / public concern with a specific issue . 5 Because the economic control variables and the family decline item were not fielded in the same ballot of the 1972 survey , the first stage of the analyses spans the 1976 to 1996 surveys . 6 While all measures of religious group mem - berships have some limitations because of ran - dom measurement error and the complexity of denominational families in the United States ( T . Smith 1990 ; Woodberry and Smith 1998 ) , the current scheme identifies the main boundaries between religious traditions , providing the most systematic approach to measuring U . S . religious denominations . A different 7 - category typology derived from work by T . Smith ( 1990 ) yields similar findings . 196 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Table 1 .

" SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CONTROLS Given the importance of economic factors to perceptions of social problems ( Kiewiet 1983 ) , I include in the first ( and also third ) stage of the analyses controls for economic performance evaluations . Retrospective evaluations are measured using two dummy variables for responses comparing respon - dents ' current economic and past economic situations ; prospective evaluations are mea - sured using two dummy variables for re - sponses comparing current and future eco - nomic situations . All stages of the analyses include the following sociodemographic con - trol variables : education ( in years ) ; house - hold income ( measured in 1992 dollars ) ; age ( in years ) ; region ( coded 1 for South ) ; race ( coded 1 for African American respondents ) ; gender ( coded 1 for female respondents ) ; and class ( dummy variables for professionals , managers , routine white - collar employees , self - employed nonprofessionals , skilled workers , unskilled / semiskilled workers , and non - full time labor force participants ) . MEASURES OF VOTE CHOICE In the second and third stages of the analy - sis ( see Table 1 ) , the dependent variable is vote choice in presidential elections ( coded 0 if voted for the Republican candidate and 1 if voted for the Democratic candidate ) . 7 7 There is no clear theoretical basis for antici - In the second stage I analyze the magnitude and over - time pattern of change in the po - litical - behavioral effects of concern with family decline over the entire 1972 through 1996 period . In the third stage of the analysis , I take advantage of a larger array of items avail - able in the 1992 and 1996 NES surveys to obtain corroborating evidence that the politi - cal effects of concern with family decline are independent of other , better - known sources of the presidential vote ( e . g . , Abramson , Aldrich , and Rohde 1999 ) . 8 These items in - pating that concern with family decline has a sig - nificant relationship to third - party candidacies or to voter turnout in presidential elections , and ad - ditional analysis provides no evidence of such relationships . Using a logistic regression model of third - party support that includes terms only for the main effects of election , the improvement in - 2 log - likelihood obtained by estimating the main effect of a concern with family decline is a non - significant 2 . 47 ( 1 d . f . ) ; the corresponding change in - 2 log - likelihood when using voter turnout as the dependent variable is 3 . 27 ( 1 d . f . ) , also not significant at the p < . 05 level . 8 The inclusion of such measures ( and also in - dependent variables related to vote choice and public opinion in the second stage of the analy - sis ) are useful in controlling for significant sources of political change such as evaluations of the performance of the economy and ongoing trends in the effects of social cleavages ( Abramson , Aldrich , and Rohde 1999 ; Dalton and Wattenberg 1993 ) . 198 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW 12 10 8 0 ) 0 ) 0 0 0 . tr , CL 6 4 - - Survey years when alternative ! question wording B was used 2 - - - - - - j - - - - - 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 Year Figure 1 .

STATISTICAL MODELS The dependent variables analyzed in this study are dichotomous . I use logistic regres - sion models to analyze the sources of con - cern with family decline and the effects of family decline concern on presidential vote choice , evaluating nested models that incor - porate theoretically relevant hypotheses . RESULTS TRENDS IN PUBLIC CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE Have levels of public concern with family decline changed since the 1960s ? Figure 1 displays the observed percentage of adult Americans who viewed family decline as the most important problem in the U . S . between 1972 and 1996 . These data provide evidence for a growing trend in public concern with family decline since 1980 . From 1976 through 1984 , fewer than 2 percent of Americans considered fam - ily decline to be the most important problem . During the subsequent decade , public con - cern with family decline increased steadily and linearly , and by 1996 , 1 out of 10 adult Americans ranked family decline as the most important social problem . Low levels of con - cern with family decline during the middle 1970s were preceded by slightly higher lev - els in the early 1970s . However , the 1972 level is roughly half that of the 1996 level , with the latter representing the highest ob - served level of concern with family decline . Taken as a whole , these results show that re - lying on presidential election year surveys does not yield a biased portrait of trends dur - ing the 1972 through 1996 period . 9 9 A source of potential ambiguity stems from the alternative wording of the question used in RELIGION AND CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE 199 Table 2 .

I address this question using the analyses presented in Table 2 . The entries in this table are coeffi - cients and standard errors for two logistic regression models in which concern with the 1980 and 1982 surveys . Although the esti - mates of family decline concern for 1980 and 1982 are significantly lower than those in the ad - jacent years , they are consistent with the implied picture of a declining trend through the late 1970s followed by an increasing trend starting in the mid - 1980s . family decline is predicted as a function of religion factors and other independent vari - ables . The effects of education , household in - come , region , class , gender , and race are not significant . Only one of the four coefficients for the effects of the economic controls is statistically significant . The effect of age is significant , but the impact is small - a 20 - year difference in age changes the log - odds of a concern with family decline by only . 2 . While the sign of the coefficient for the ef - fect of race is in keeping with past research documenting enduring differences in policy preferences among African Americans ver - sus others ( Tate 1993 ) , the coefficient is not significant . 200 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW The key to understanding the social sources of these attitudes lies with the causal factors associated with the theory of religious influence . With regard to religious group memberships , evangelical Protestants have the highest level of concern with family de - cline . With regard to religious participation , the . 45 coefficient for church attendance sug - gests that attendance is an important addi - tional source of concern with family de - cline . 10 Comparing across the full range of religious participation , moving from nonat - tendance to weekly attendance raises the odds of viewing family decline as the most important problem by a factor of 9 . 5 ( corre - sponding to an approximately . 28 increase in probability from an initial baseline of . 05 ) . Model 2 explores these results in greater detail . Model 2 has a single , additional coef - ficient for the interaction of church atten - dance and membership in evangelical Prot - estant denominations , and it improves over Model l ' s fit according to both the - 2 log - likelihood statistic and BIC index . This in - dicates that the impact of church attendance on concern with family decline is signifi - cantly different for evangelical Protestants compared with all other religious groups . Model 2 ' s coefficients reveal two impor - tant findings . First , the difference between the coefficients for evangelical Protestants and those of other religious groups shrinks considerably , suggesting that it is the differ - ential and larger effects of church atten - dance among evangelicals that explain their higher levels of concern with family decline . Second , although participation in any reli - gious institution has a significant effect in both models , this effect is smaller in Model 2 than in Model 1 . Because the pattern of interaction between religion and church attendance is central to understanding the sources of concern with 10 As a check on interval - level measurement of the church attendance covariate , I evaluated two alternative specifications to Model 1 . The first of these , a logarithmetic transformation of attendance , consumes the same degrees of free - dom as Model 1 , but provides a far worse fit to data ( - 2 log - likelihood = 1899 . 15 ; BIC = - 64 , 167 ) . The second specification uses dummy variables to measure attendance as a nominal covariate , and it also yields a worse fit to data ( - 2 log - likelihood = 1877 . 20 ; BIC = - 64 , 153 ) . family decline , I also evaluate the fit of sev - eral supplementary models in Table 3 to test additional hypotheses . These analyses find no evidence for any additional interaction effects involving Protestant or Catholic de - nominational memberships and church at - tendance . ll The additional analyses also provide no evidence of change in the effects of attendance over time ( the fit of Model 1 is superior to the fits of Models 7 through 10 ) . The superiority of the preferred model from Table 2 ( Model 1 in Table 3 ) implies that interaction effects involving religion and church attendance are limited to the two - way interaction of church attendance x evan - gelical Protestants . A CLOSER LOOK AT THE EFFECTS OF RELIGION FACTORS Figure 2 summarizes the effects of religion and church attendance on concern with fam - ily decline . Given the interaction between evangelical Protestants and church atten - dance , it is appropriate to simultaneously consider the effects of all religion factors . Figure 2 presents the predicted probability of ranking family decline as the most impor - tant problem by varying religious group membership and church attendance rate , holding all other independent variables at fixed levels . 12 In Figure 2 , the generally small curvature of the lines for mainline and black Protes - tants , Catholics , Jewish respondents , and those with no religion13 indicate that church l The small reduction in the - 2 log - likelihood statistic produced by allowing the effects of church attendance to differ across all religious groups ( see Model 2 ) is not close to achieving significance using either the chi - square test or BIC . Comparison of Model 1 with Models 3 and 4 provides no evidence for interactions involving race or gender and religion ; comparison of Model 1 with Models 5 and 6 provides no evidence for interactions involving race or gender and church attendance . 12 The fixed values for these variables are : nonblack males living outside the South in 1984 who are not working full - time , who are at the sample means of age , education , and household income , and who endorse the " same " response to the economic evaluation items . 13 While the fact that church attendance has any impact on respondents in the " no religion " RELIGION AND CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE 201 Table 3 .

By contrast , church attendance has a slightly larger im - pact on family decline concern among re - spondents in other religions . ' 4 The largest effects of church attendance are found , how - ever , among evangelical Protestants , with regular church attenders being over 24 times more likely than nonattenders to consider family decline as the most important prob - lem . The magnitudes of the church atten - dance effect among evangelical Protestants can be seen in the last panel ' s estimates ; these estimates reveal that compared with category may appear initially to represent a para - dox , it is readily explained by the heterogeneity of individuals within this category ( Glenn 1987b ) , not all of whom are genuine atheists . 14 Model 2 ' s coefficients ( see Table 2 ) assume that the impact of church attendance on the log - odds of concern with family decline is identical across all religious groups ( with the single excep - tion of evangelical Protestants ) . Note that be - cause the level of these attitudes is higher among respondents in the " other religion " category com - pared with the remaining groups , the predicted effect of church attendance on the probability of family decline concern among other religions is higher . This divergence in logit versus probabil - ity metrics reflects the insensitivity of the logit estimates to the distribution of the dependent variable . the 24 - fold effect for evangelicals , the cor - responding effect of church attendance among all other respondents ( i . e . , all non - evangelicals ) is approximately 5 . Although these results suggest that church attendance ( and thus exposure to church - based communication and influence ) is the underlying factor explaining evangelical Protestants ' comparatively high levels of concern with family decline , an alternative hypothesis is that regular church attendance is instead the result of members ' preexisting attitudes . Two considerations cast doubt on this alternative hypothesis . First , research on religious participation finds that church at - tendance is shaped strongly by socialization and life course transitions ( Sherkat 1998 ; Stolzenberg , Blair - Loy , and Waite 1995 ) , factors not likely to be influenced by a con - cern with family decline . Second , if family decline concern influenced church atten - dance , the over - time increase in concern would by itself have caused a subsequent rise in church attendance rates . Although contemporary research on church attendance is marked by a significant debate over whether U . S . church attendance remains high and generally stable ( Hout and Greeley 1987 ; 1998 ) or instead involves over - reporting and possibly also over - time de - cline ( Hadaway , Marler , and Chaves 1993 , Evangelical Protestant . . . . - - - - - - - - - Mainline Protestant Black Protestant Jewish Low High Church Attendance Level Other Religion - - - - . - - - . - - - - - Low H Church Attendance Level ligh Low No Religion Church Attendance Level High Low All Non - Evangelical Church Attendance Level High Figure 2 .

It is , in principle , possible that self - selection is operating while a third fac - tor that is uncorrelated with level of concern with family decline simultaneously acts so as to depress church attendance . Although this scenario cannot be ruled out , it is con - siderably more complicated than the infer - ence that church attendance influences con - cern with family decline . The absence of any evidence for the more complicated scenario suggests that the simpler proposition is pref - erable . Given that public concern with family de - cline is concentrated among evangelical Protestants who attend church regularly , we can reestimate the increase in concerns over family decline from 1980 to 1996 to better observe the importance of evangelical atti - tudes to this trend : Whereas the overall in - crease in level of family decline concern is 9 percent , the corresponding increase with - out evangelicals ' attitudes shrinks to 5 per - cent . Accordingly , without the dispropor - tionate concentration and growth of concern with family decline among evangelical Prot - estants , the overall increase in such attitudes would have been considerably smaller . THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW POLITICAL CLEAVAGE Does concern with family decline affect the behavior of voters , perhaps leading to the emergence of a new political cleavage ? I an - swer this question using the results of the second stage of the analysis . In Table 4 , I evaluate the fit of a series of models that pre - dict the log - odds of Democratic versus Re - publican Party vote choice in the seven presi - dential elections between 1972 and 1996 . The comparison between the first two models easily favors Model 2 , providing evi - dence that concern with family decline does affect presidential vote choice . Model 3 is preferred over Model 2 , establishing that the political effects of concern with family de - cline have changed over time , following a linear pattern . Allowing the effects of fam - ily decline concern to differ in each election ( Model 4 ) does not improve over Model 3 , and the small difference in - 2 log - likelihood between Models 3 and 4 ( 3 . 24 ; 5 d . f . ) im - plies that all the interaction between family decline concern and year is captured by Model 3 . In the final model ( Model 5 ) , I add a series of controls to estimate the direct ef - fects of concern with family decline on vote choice . The coefficients from Models 2 , 3 , and 5 provide more detailed information about the 204 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW effect of public concern with family decline on vote choice . Given that Model 3 im - proves over Model 2 ' s fit , Model 3 ' s coeffi - cients reveal the ways in which Model 2 misspecifies the political effects of concern with family decline : Instead of a large , stable effect ( as in Model 2 ) , Model 3 ' s coeffi - cients suggest that the effects of concern with family decline increased steadily over time . More specifically , the predicted effect of concern with family decline is modest in the 1970s , but by 1984 the effect is substan - tial ( - 1 . 41 ) , and by 1996 , the corresponding effect is predictably larger ( - 2 . 31 ) . All else being equal , concern with family decline in - creasingly disposes voters to favor Republi - can over Democratic presidential candidates . The over - time growth in the effect on vote choice of a concern with family decline also suggests that high levels of such concerns prior to the 1970s were of limited political consequence ( given the much smaller coef - ficient for family decline concern early in the 1972 to 1996 series ) . Comparing the coefficients for Models 3 versus Model 5 reveals whether the effect of concern with family decline on vote choice is independent of the corresponding politi - cal effects of the sociodemographic co - variates . The coefficient for the family de - cline concern x year effect is virtually un - changed across Models 3 versus 5 , suggest - ing the independence of the political effects of family decline concern . 15 The magnitude of the effects of concern with family decline on vote choice over a relatively lengthy period of time suggests the emergence of a growing cleavage in presidential elections during the late 1980s and early 1990s . Using Model 5 ' s coeffi - cients ( and the relevant sample means ) , the predicted difference in vote choice for re - spondents scoring 0 versus 1 on the family decline item is . 30 in 1988 , . 41 in 1992 , and . 48 in 1996 . These predicted differences are 15 I also compared Model 5 with a competing model that allows the religion and family decline concern variables to interact with one another . The resulting lack of improvement in fit ( 7 . 25 ; 6 d . f . ) implies that the effect of concern with fam - ily decline on vote choice is the same for the seven religious groups in the analysis ( see Ap - pendix A for all coefficients and standard errors for Model 5 in Table 4 ) . large , especially given that they reflect the influence of a single variable . For instance , the preceding estimates indicate that view - ing family decline as the most important problem in the 1996 election is predicted as substantially lowering ( by . 48 ) the probabil - ity of a typical voter supporting the Demo - cratic candidate ( Bill Clinton ) . To provide additional evidence that the ef - fect of family decline concern on vote choice is independent of other , better - known sources of the presidential vote , Table 5 presents the third stage of the analysis , which takes ad - vantage of more extensive data available in the 1992 and 1996 NES surveys . Model 1 of Table 5 estimates the total effect of concern with family decline on presidential vote choice , and Model 2 estimates the direct ef - fect by controlling for attitudes toward abor - tion , gender , the welfare state , economic evaluations ( and sociodemographic factors ) . The key comparison in Table 5 is between the coefficient for concern with family de - cline in Model 1 versus Model 2 . The total effect of a concern with family decline is larger than the direct effect , but the coeffi - cient in Model 2 retains over 73 percent of its original magnitude . This result provides evidence that the association between con - cern with family decline and presidential vote choice represents a new source of voter alignments in the United States ( rather than the political effect of a preexisting cleavage ) . It should be emphasized that because the actual percentage of voters exhibiting high levels of concern with family decline has been relatively modest ( 10 percent at its highest level in 1996 ) , the effects of this cleavage on the outcome of elections have also been modest . For instance , the 6 - percent increase in concern with family decline from 1988 to 1996 is predicted as lowering the Democratic share of the major party vote in 1996 by approximately 3 percent , resulting in a slightly lower margin of victory for Democratic incumbent Bill Clinton without necessarily changing the outcome of that election . For the family decline cleavage to have a larger effect on the outcome of elec - tions , either the level of family decline con - cern or its association with vote choice would have to increase . In the absence of these de - velopments , the family decline cleavage is most notable as a new dimension of partisan RELIGION AND CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE 205 Table 5 .

DISCUSSION Scholarly debates over the family decline thesis have focused primarily on demo - graphic or economic processes such as trends in nonmarital birth rates or the eco - nomic consequences of divorce . As a result , neither proponents nor critics of the family decline thesis have systematically investi - gated attitudes toward family change . The absence of analysis makes it impossible to evaluate important but untested hypotheses about rising public concern with family de - cline ( Popenoe 1993 ; Scammon and Watten - berg [ 1970 ] 1992 ; Wilson 1993 ) . Moreover , such investigations can yield an informative portrait of the meaning of family processes , 206 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW especially because attitudes , beliefs , and preferences do not necessarily correspond to the precise contours of social structural change . By analyzing the phenomenon of family decline in terms of the level of public concern , I have sought to extend research on family change to address new and fruitful questions of relevance to political sociology and the sociology of religion as well . My approach has been guided by a theory of religious influence that emerges from re - search on the substantial effects of religion factors on political participation and family behaviors ( Sherkat and Ellison 1999 ; Verba et al . 1995 , chap . 15 ) . This study ' s results reveal the utility of this theoretical approach , providing new evidence for the relevance of specific religious processes to understanding conflicts , attitudes toward family change , and voters ' political alignment based on these attitudes . All three factors considered here affect individuals ' level of concern with fam - ily decline , showing the importance of con - ceptualizing and testing hypotheses about what specific religion factor is behind a par - ticular phenomenon . In doing so , these re - sults suggest the fruitfulness of synthesizing institutional and individual - level factors to better understand the influence of religion within other empirical contexts ( Chaves and Gorski 2001 ; Wuthnow and Lawson 1994 ) . FAMILY CHANGE AND FAMILY ATTITUDES Regarding controversies over subjective as - pects of family change , my analyses provide evidence of a growing trend between 1980 and 1996 in public concern with family de - cline as the most important social problem in the United States . Whereas in 1980 less than 1 percent of Americans considered fam - ily decline as the most important problem , this figure had grown to 10 percent by 1996 . This trend is consistent with the hypothesis discussed above , and it can be further appre - ciated when juxtaposed with results from my analyses of its consequences for political be - havior . Indeed , in the absence of such evi - dence , skeptical commentators might rea - sonably call into question the sociological significance of a phenomenon that has no ef - fect on the actual behavior of individuals . My analyses address this question by provid - ing evidence that voters ' level of concern with family decline has had a growing im - pact on their voting behavior in presidential elections , with concern with family decline by itself disposing voters to support Repub - lican candidates . The growing association between level of family decline concern and presidential vote choice suggests the emergence of a new cleavage in U . S . politics . We can appreciate the justification for this inference by consid - ering the implications of results that instead showed a pattern of short - term political - be - havioral effects ( or a pattern in which the ef - fects of family decline concern varied widely in magnitude over time ) . Results of this sort would suggest the emergence of a policy is - sue whose partisan relevance was specific to one or more particular campaigns or elec - tions , but not the emergence of a new politi - cal cleavage . However , because it is charac - terized by a growing trend in partisan impact , and because it is shaped by the divergent ex - periences of groups with long - standing dif - ferences in identity and ideological orienta - tion , the issue of family decline appears to qualify as a novel cleavage . POLITICAL - SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON ELECTORAL POLITICS The results of this study advance political - sociological research on electoral politics in two additional ways . First , evidence for the emergence of a new and relatively enduring source of U . S . voter alignments extends con - temporary research and scholarly debates over partisan change in developed democra - cies ( Dalton and Wattenberg 1993 ) . Indeed , voters ' alignments with political parties since the 1960s , once assumed to be " frozen " in historical time ( Lipset and Rokkan 1967 ) , have increasingly been found to evolve in novel ways that become explicable when linked to ongoing social conflicts and opin - ion trends ( Brooks 2000 ; Carmines and Lay - man 1997 ) . A second connection to political - socio - logical research concerns the revitalization of network - based theories of U . S . politics . Recent advances have provided an analyti - cal basis for understanding how social struc - tural factors influence individuals ' political attitudes and behavior by transmitting infor - mation and influence through social network RELIGION AND CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE 207 ties ( Huckfeldt , Plutzer , Sprague 1993 ; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1991 ) . My findings bear on social network theorizing , suggest - ing not only that religious group member - ships influence politically - relevant attitudes , but also that their influence operates simul - taneously through congregation - level pro - cesses , attesting to the importance of reli - gious institutions and the communicative ca - pacities of religious leaders . My research thus corroborates the general expectation that the political and communi - cative influence of social structure is often mediated by the quantity of networks link - ing individuals ( Zuckerman , Valentino , and Zuckerman 1994 ) . Although recent network research on U . S . politics has found evidence for the effects of weak ties that bridge dif - ferent social groups ( Huckfeldt and Sprague 1991 ) , my findings regarding the effects of denomination and church attendance attest to the ongoing importance of social ties that reinforce cohesive group boundaries . Reli - gious institutions provide a particularly in - structive example of such factors because churches facilitate types of communication that activate members ' preexisting beliefs and also the authority of clergy ( Wald et al . 1988 , 1990 ) . The network position of reli - gious leaders appears particularly signifi - cant , suggesting the disproportionate influ - ence of evangelical clergy and also the ways in which network and institutional flows of communication are not historically invari - ant , but depend instead upon the activities of strategically positioned groups or actors . THE RELIGIOUS SOURCES OF CONCERN WITH FAMILY DECLINE My findings also contribute to long - standing debates in the sociology of religion over conservative political trends affecting evan - gelical Protestants . Prompted by journalistic commentary on the apparent influence of Christian Right leaders in the 1980 presiden - tial election , a subsequent body of research casts doubt on these early hypotheses . Not only were the Moral Majority and its policy positions found to be unpopular ( Buell and Sigelman 1985 ; Sigelman and Presser 1988 ) , but the proportion of evangelicals actively involved in conservative interest groups ap - pears to have been small ( Wuthnow 1999 ) . Furthermore , conservative Protestants as a whole have comparatively low levels of po - litical participation , remaining in a Republi - can political alignment that appears to have been established prior to the 1980s ( Bruce 1994 ; Manza and Brooks 1997 ) . More recently , however , an emerging body of research has begun to reexamine conser - vative trends among evangelicals and pos - sible avenues of Christian Right influence , suggesting some modifications to earlier findings . In addition to the success of a small number of Christian Right candidates in state and local elections in the 1990s ( Green 1995 ; Rozell and Wilcox 1997 ) , a 1996 sur - vey found that 20 percent of respondents re - ported using information provided by Chris - tian Right organizations in deciding whom to support in elections ( Regnerus et al . 1999 ) . Moreover , although earlier claims about religion - based polarization in attitudes find little support ( Davis and Robinson 1996 ; DiMaggio , Evans , and Bryson 1996 ) , evangelicals ( or conservative Protestants ) are more likely than others to support con - servative policy positions on such specific issues as gender roles and sexuality ( Sherkat and Ellison 1999 ; Woodberry and Smith 1998 ) . The current study ' s results contribute to the reconsideration of political trends among evangelicals by providing evidence that growing levels of concern with family de - cline between 1980 and 1996 were dispro - portionately concentrated among evangelical Protestants . I find evidence that high levels of concern with family decline are facilitated by exposure to church - based religious com - munication . The effect of regular church at - tendance is larger for members of evangeli - cal Protestant churches , attesting to differ - ences in the effects of religious communica - tion across denominations , especially be - tween evangelical versus nonevangelical churches . These results imply that claims about family decline found their most recep - tive audience among active members of evangelical Protestant denominations . 16 16 The possibility that concern with family de - cline influences church attendance is less likely than the reverse , given that it implies that growth in family decline concern would by itself have raised church attendance rates - and research has 208 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW My results bear further on questions con - cerning the effects of religious movements . During the 1990s , the Christian Coalition offered a problem - oriented characterization of family decline , using voter guides that were widely distributed in churches and through public addresses often conducted by ( then ) executive director , Ralph Reed ( Reed 1994 , 1996 ) . When viewed through the lens of the theory of religious influence applied here , the preceding results raise fruitful questions about the influence of Christian Right organizations on clergy and members of evangelical Protestant churches . In gen - eral , my findings are consistent with this scenario and also with recent research on the political influence of the Christian Right on evangelical voters in the 1990s ( Regnerus et al . 1999 ) . Although it seems likely that well - positioned evangelical leaders communi - cated messages resulting in higher levels of concern with family decline among their congregations , the possibility that communi - cative processes among church attenders ( or some combination of these two factors ) were also important cannot be conclusively ruled out . Using the results of the current study as a baseline , further research may be able to shed additional light on this line of interpre - tation . The causal importance of religion factors also suggests some limits on the growth of public concern with family decline . First , the changing social and economic context of the past decade - stabilization in divorce rates and nonmarital births coupled with rising household income and low unemployment - may direct some religious leaders ' attention to other issues while lowering the receptiv - ity of individuals to family decline claims that emphasize the negative economic con - sequences of divorce or single - parenthood . A second factor relates to denominational differences and the concentration of con - cerns with family decline among evangeli - found no evidence of such trends ( Hadaway et al . 1993 , 1998 ; Presser and Stinson 1998 ; Woodberry 1998 ) - or the operation of a consid - erably more complicated causal scenario for which there is no evidence . Evidence that church attendance is shaped by socialization and life - course transitions ( Sherkat 1998 ) is also relevant , given that it is improbable that concern with fam - ily decline could influence the latter factors . cal Protestants . Contemporary research on perceptions of religious groups finds that in - dividuals who are not members of evangeli - cal Protestant denominations have generally negative attitudes toward the views they at - tribute to evangelicals ( C . Smith 1998 ) . In the absence of social networks that would extend their communicative influence across denominational boundaries , it seems likely that claims associated with evangelical Prot - estant clergy or laity will have a more lim - ited impact on members of other religious traditions . The disproportionate concentra - tion of concern with family decline among the most observant evangelicals reveals not only the most receptive constituency for this phenomenon but also suggests some pos - sible limits on its further growth .
