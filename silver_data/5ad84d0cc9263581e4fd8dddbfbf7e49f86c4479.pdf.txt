Although recent studies have implicated the C - terminal Eps15 Homology Domain ( EHD ) protein , EHD1 , as a key regulator of TRE vesiculation , additional proteins involved in this process have been largely uncharacterized . In the present study , we identify the GTPase Regulator Associated with Focal adhesion kinase - 1 ( GRAF1 ) protein in a complex with EHD1 and the TRE hub protein , Molecules Interacting with CasL - Like1 ( MICAL - L1 ) . Over - expression of GRAF1 caused vesiculation of MICAL - L1 - containing TRE , whereas GRAF1 - depletion led to impaired TRE vesiculation and delayed receptor recycling . Moreover , co - addition of puriﬁed EHD1 and GRAF1 in a semi - permeabilized cell vesiculation assay produced synergistic TRE vesiculation . Overall , based on our data , we suggest that in addition to its roles in clathrin - independent endocytosis , GRAF1 synergizes with EHD1 to support TRE vesiculation . Keywords : BAR domain , PH domain , tubulation , EHD1 , MICAL - L1 , GRAF1 , tubular recycling endosome , vesiculation INTRODUCTION Endosomes are a primary “vehicle” for protein transport within the cell ( Jovic et al . , 2010 ) . This transportation includes the sort - ing and delivering of cargo molecules to their corresponding destinations , which depends upon a series of well - coordinated membrane ﬁssion and fusion events . A large group of cytoso - lic proteins assemble onto membranes to inﬂuence their shape , and facilitate the formation of a budding vesicle . These vesi - cles / carriers are then transported along microtubule tracks to a speciﬁc destination where they eventually fuse with a target mem - brane and release their cargo . Such proteins often assemble as a complex and can act as an “operational unit . ” We recently identiﬁed a protein that serves as a membrane - hub on tubular recycling endosomes ( TREs ) ( Rahajeng et al . , 2012 ) , and coordinates multiple events that shape the mem - branes during endocytic transport ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . Molecules Interacting with CAsL - Like1 ( MICAL - L1 ) is a novel TRE marker ( Sharma et al . , 2009 ) , which recruits and stabilizes a battery of proteins that leads to a direct impact on membrane shaping ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . MICAL - L1 recruits many essen - tial membrane modulators to TREs , including Rab8 ( Sharma et al . , 2009 ) and proteins that possess Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ( BAR ) domains ( summarized in Figure 8A ) . Such BAR domain - containing proteins induce membranes into highly curved shapes ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Zimmerberg and Kozlov , 2006 ) and include the N - BAR protein Amphiphysin / Bin1 ( Pant et al . , 2009 ) , and the F - BAR protein Syndapin2 , also known as PACSIN2 ( Braun et al . , 2005 ; Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . MICAL - L1 also interacts with the C - terminal Eps15 Homology Domain ( EHD ) proteins , EHD3 and EHD1 ( Sharma et al . , 2009 ; Kieken et al . , 2010 ) , which are involved in membrane tubulation and vesiculation , respectively ( Cai et al . , 2013 ) . Also crucial for TRE biogenesis is the generation of phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , an essential lipid component of TRE tubules that binds and recruits MICAL - L1 and Syndapin2 , thus promoting F - BAR - induced tubulation ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . EHD1 subsequently joins this complex on TRE where it binds to both MICAL - L1 and Syndapin2 and performs scission , giving rise to newly formed recycling endosomes ( Cai et al . , 2013 ; Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . Along with the growing consensus for EHD1 as a vesicula - tor of TRE ( Jakobsson et al . , 2011 ; Cai et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) , there is also evidence suggesting that additional proteins are involved in the scission process . For example , EHD1 directly interacts and cooperates with the lipid - modiﬁer enzyme , cPLA2 α , to ini - tiate and facilitate vesiculation , thus supporting the generation of transport vesicles ( Cai et al . , 2012 ) . Another protein with poten - tial to be involved in TRE vesiculation is the GTPase Regulator Associated with Focal adhesion kinase - 1 ( GRAF1 ; also known as Oligophrenin - 1 - Like ) . GRAF1 is a protein that cooperates with other proteins to remodel tubulo - vesicular clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) derived from the plasma membrane ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , thus regulating endocytosis . GRAF1 belongs to a family of proteins , all of which are comprised of a similar domain - conﬁguration ( see scheme in Figure 1A ) consisting of : an N - terminal BAR domain , a pleckstrin www . frontiersin . org May 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 22 | 1 CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY Cai et al . GRAF1 vesiculates tubular recycling endosomes FIGURE 1 | HeLa cells predominantly express the GRAF1c isoform , which interacts with the hub - protein , MICAL - L1 . ( A ) The domain architecture of the three GRAF1 isoforms . ( B ) GRAF1 isoforms ( a , b , and c ) were ampliﬁed from either human brain or HeLa cDNA libraries with two primers as indicated in ( A ) . ( C ) Cells were either left in culture , or transfected with either HA - GRAF1b , or HA - GRAF1c for 16h . In the left panel , the cells were subsequently mock - treated or treated with GRAF1 - siRNA for 72h before being lysed on ice . Lysates were subjected to 8 % SDS - PAGE , followed by immunoblotting with anti - GRAF1 and anti - Actin antibodies ( loading control ) . ( D ) Cells were either transfected with HA - MAPK as a negative control or HA - GRAF1c . After 48h , cells were lysed for 1h in buffer containing 50mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and protease inhibitors . Cell lysates were incubated with mouse anti - MICAL - L1 antibody overnight . Protein L beads were added to the mixture of cell lysate and MICAL - L1 antibody for 3h at 4 ◦ C . Beads were washed in buffer containing 50mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton . Proteins were eluted by adding SDS loading buffer . Samples were subjected to 8 % SDS - PAGE , followed by blotting with anti - HA and anti - MICAL - L1 antibodies . homology ( PH ) domain , a Rho - GAP , a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) and a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ) . The PH domain is found in a variety of proteins , and it directly binds to Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) ( Harlan et al . , 1995 ) . The BAR and PH domains of GRAF1 work cooperatively to bind to highly curved PIP2 - containing tubular and vesicular membranes ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Via its Rho - GAP domain , GRAF1 can also affect cer - tain small G proteins such as RhoA and Cdc42 ( Taylor et al . , 1999 ; Shibata et al . , 2001 ; Jelen et al . , 2009 ) . Due to its multi - domain architecture , GRAF1 has numer - ous functions that include ( 1 ) localizing onto membranes ( 2 ) interacting with membrane - shaping proteins , such as Dynamin , and ( 3 ) activating RhoA / Cdc42 small G - proteins , thereby indirectly impacting cytoskeleton - related processes . In addition , GRAF1 interacts with Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) to regulate cell spreading by remodeling microdomains and the cytoskeleton at podosomes , leading to membrane turnover during morphological adjustments ( summarized in Model Figure 8A ) ( Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ; Doherty et al . , 2011 ) . We propose a novel function for GRAF1 and hypothesize that in addition to its previously described regulatory roles , GRAF1 might be involved in TRE vesiculation . Our study indicates that GRAF1 interacts with both MICAL - L1 and EHD1 to regulate TRE vesiculation and mediate endocytic recycling .

GRAF1 vesiculates tubular recycling endosomes METHODS AND MATERIALS ANTIBODIES The afﬁnity - puriﬁed rabbit polyclonal peptide antibod - ies directed against the C - terminus of human EHD1 ( DLPPHLVPPSKRRHE ) were previously described ( Caplan et al . , 2002 ) . Mouse monoclonal MEM - 43 antibody against CD59 was a generous gift of Dr . V . Horejsi ( Praha , Czech Republic ) ( Cai et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) . The following commercial antibodies were used in this study : mouse anti - GRAF1 ( Abcam ) , mouse anti - HA ( Covance ) , rabbit anti - HA ( Signalway ) , mouse anti - Actin and mouse anti - MICAL - L1 ( Novus Biologicals , Inc . ) , mouse anti - Rab5 ( Transduction Laboratories ) , rabbit anti - Rab11 ( US Biologicals ) , mouse anti - β 1 integrin ( AbD Serotec ) , goat anti - mouse horseradish - peroxidase ( HRP ) ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) , donkey anti - rabbit HRP ( GE Healthcare ) , Alexa 568 goat anti - mouse , Alexa 488 goat anti - rabbit and Alexa 568 goat anti - rabbit ( Invitrogen ) . The transfection reagents X - treme GENE 9 , GeneExpresso and Oligofectamine were obtained from Roche Applied Science Innovita and Invitrogen , respectively . cDNA GRAF1b and GRAF1c were ampliﬁed from HeLa cDNA and human brain cDNA , respectively , using the primers CCGGAATTCGGATGGGGCTCCCAGCGCTCGAGTTCAG and AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTTAGAGGAACTCCACGTAATTCTCAGG . Ampliﬁed GRAF1b and GRAF1c were then cloned into the pHA - CMV vector . HA - GRAF1c ( BAR ) ( 1 - 250aa ) , HA - GRAF1c ( BAR - PH ) ( 1 - 383aa ) , HA - GRAF1c ( BAR - PH - GAP ) ( 1 - 663aa ) and HA - GRAF1c ( R412D ) mutants were engineered using PCR directed mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) . GST - GRAF1c was generated as follows : GRAF1c was ampliﬁed from HA - GRAF1c by using primers CGCGGATCCATGGGGCTCCCAGCGCTCGAGTTCAG and AA GGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTTAGAGGAACTCCACGTAATTCTCAGGandclonedintopGEX - 6P - 2 vector . GST - GRAF1c ( BAR - PH ) was created by introducing a stop codon following aa 383 in the wild - type GST - GRAF1c . PROTEIN PURIFICATION GST - GRAF1c and GST - GRAF1c ( BAR - PH ) were transformed into BL21 bacterial , which was cultured in Super Broth media at 37 ◦ C . When the OD reached 0 . 5 , cells were induced with 0 . 2 mM IPTG and cultured at 18 ◦ C overnight . Cells were then lysed by French Press . GST - GRAF1c and GST - GRAF1c ( BAR - PH ) were puriﬁed from the lysates using Glutathione S - transferase beads . EHD1 was cloned into a pCOLD - GST vector and puriﬁed as described in Hayashi and Kojima ( 2008 ) . GENE KNOCKDOWN BY SILENCING RNA ( siRNA ) AND RESCUE EXPERIMENTS Four speciﬁc oligonucleotides directed at GRAF1 ( GCACTAC TGTACATATCAA , CAAGGGCTGTATCGAATTG , GAACGGA TACGGATGATTG , GGAGAAACGTCACTTTGGA ) , using On - Target SMART pool ( Dhamacon ) , were transfected into HeLa cells with Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) for 72 h to knockdown endogenous human GRAF1 . Mock - SiRNA was essentially the same treatment as for SiRNA - treated cells , excluding the oligonu - cleotide ( s ) . The siRNA - resistant HA - GRAF1 was engineered using QuickChange site directed mutagenesis . The speciﬁcity of the knockdown was conﬁrmed by rescue experiments : the siRNA - resistant HA - GRAF1 was transfected into GRAF1 - siRNA - treated cells by using X - treme GENE 9 , 48 h after the start of siRNA treatment . IMMUNOBLOTTING HeLa cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min in buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) . The lysate supernatants were obtained after centrifugation . Total protein level in the lysate was quantiﬁed by Bio - Rad protein assay ( Bio - Rad laboratories , Inc . ) for equal protein loading on gels in siRNA experiments . Samples were resolved by 8 % SDS - PAGE . CO - IMMUNOPRECIPITATION HeLa cells growing on 100 mm dishes were transfected with HA - tagged proteins by using GeneExpresso . After 20 h , cells were lysed for 1 h in buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and protease inhibitor cocktail . Cell lysates were incubated with either mouse anti - MICAL - L1 antibody or rabbit anti - EHD1 antibody at 4 ◦ C overnight , followed by incuba - tion with protein L agarose beads ( Fisher Thermo Scientiﬁc ) and Rabbit IP Matrix beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) for 3 h at 4 ◦ C , respectively . Beads were washed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 4 times , and proteins were eluted using 4 × SDS loading buffer . Samples were sub - jected to 8 % SDS - PAGE , followed by blotting with appropriate antibodies . IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE , CD59 UPTAKE ASSAY AND β 1 INTEGRIN PULSE - CHASE ASSAY HeLa cells were grown on cover slips , occasionally transfected with X - treme GENE 9 or oligofectamine , as noted , and ﬁxed with 4 % ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde in PBS as described previously ( Cai et al . , 2012 ) . Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibod - ies prepared in staining solution [ 0 . 2 % saponin ( w / v ) and 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) BSA in PBS ] for 1 h at room temperature . After washes with PBS , cells were incubated with the appropriate ﬂuorochrome - conjugated secondary antibody mixture in staining solution for 30 min at room temperature . All images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) with a 63x 1 . 4 numerical aperture objective with appropriate ﬁlters . For CD59 uptake assay , cells in complete medium were pulsed with anti - CD59 antibody for 15 min at 37 ◦ C , followed by 1 min incu - bation with acid stripping buffer ( 0 . 5 M NaCl and 0 . 5 % acetic acid , pH3 . 0 ) to remove surface - bound CD59 antibody . Cells were ﬁxed after stripping and stained with appropriate secondary anti - bodies . For β 1 integrin pulse - chase assay , cells were pulsed with anti - β 1 integrin for 1 h in complete media at 37 ◦ C , followed by 1 min acid stripping to remove surface - bound β 1 integrin anti - body . Cells were then either ﬁxed directly ( pulse only ) or “chased” in complete media for 4 h to allow β 1 to recycle back to the plasma membrane ( pulse and chase ) . After chase , cells were acid stripped again to remove β 1 integrin which had recycled back to the plasma membrane . www . frontiersin . org May 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 22 | 3 Cai et al . GRAF1 vesiculates tubular recycling endosomes SEMI - PERMEABILIZATION ASSAY This assay was developed ( Cai et al . , 2013 ) and modiﬁed from the methods described by Balch ( Beckers et al . , 1987 ) and Aridor ( Long et al . , 2010 ) . Brieﬂy , HeLa cells were grown on coverslips . When the cell conﬂuence reached 80 – 90 % , cytosol was extracted with 20 μ g / ml digitonin for 40 s at room temperature . After three times washing in KHM buffer containing 110 mM KOAc , 20 mM HEPES , and 2 mM MgOAc , pH 7 . 2 , semi - permeabilized cells were incubated with GST proteins in the presence of 25 mM HEPES , 115 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 5 mM creatine phos - phate and 0 . 2 IU of creatine phosphokinase for 30 min at 37 ◦ C . Cells were then washed with KHM buffer for three times , fol - lowed by ﬁxation . Fixed cells were stained with anti - MICAL - L1 antibody . QUANTIFICATION OF MICAL - L1 TUBULES BY IMAGEJ In the IMAGEJ software , background from the images was removed by adjusting the threshold . The size of particles mea - sured was set between 2 and 150 μ m 2 . Every MICAL - L1 - containing particle in this range was counted . Ten ﬁelds ( images ) from each treatment were analyzed . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS One - Way ANOVA was used to calculate statistical signiﬁcance , and all graphs show standard error bars . SELECTIVE YEAST TWO - HYBRID ASSAYS Yeast two - hybrid studies were performed as previously described ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 was co - transformed with mentioned constructs using lithium acetate procedure and allowed to grow at 30 C after streaking on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan . Once the colonies grow large enough , an average of three to four colonies were chosen , suspended in water , equilibrated to same optical density at 600 nm and replated on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan ( + His ) as well as plates also lacking histidine ( − His ) . RESULTS The multi - domain - containing protein , GRAF1 , is involved in a variety of processes including membrane - shaping , small G - protein signaling , clathrin - independent endocytosis and cell spreading ( Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ) . Because it contains both a BAR and PH domain , and has a role in membrane bend - ing similar to that of other BAR - containing proteins , and because it localizes to tubular endosomes ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , we posited that GRAF1 may be involved in the biogenesis of TREs . Recently , a studies from our lab has demonstrated the role of two key proteins in TRE biogenesis : Syndapin2 and MICAL - L1 ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) , along with the C - Terminal EHD protein , EHD3 ( Cai et al . , 2013 ) . As does GRAF1 , Syndapin2 has a membrane - bending BAR domain , whereas MICAL - L1 has 14 PRDs , short motifs known to interact with proteins con - taining SH3 domains . Since GRAF1 possesses a SH3 domain ( see Figure 1A ) , we hypothesized that GRAF1 and MICAL - L1 might function together on MICAL - L1 - enriched TRE . GRAF1 has 3 alternative splicing products , GRAF1a , b , and c , com - prised of 851 , 796 , and 759 amino acids , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . We ﬁrst assessed which alternatively spliced GRAF1 product is expressed endogenously in HeLa cells . As shown in Figure 1B , GRAF1b RNA transcripts were abundant in a HeLa cDNA library , whereas we were unable to detect GRAF1a transcripts ( Figure 1B ) . However , since it is not known in which cells and / or tissues GRAF1a is expressed ( leaving us without a “positive con - trol” for our detection system ) , we cannot rule out the possibility that GRAF1a RNA might be expressed in HeLa cells . On the other hand , GRAF1c was the only protein detected ( Figure 1C , left lane ) . This was veriﬁed by comparing overexpressed HA - GRAF1b and c , with endogenously expressed GRAF1 in non - transfected HeLa cells ( Figure 1C ; middle panel ) . Endogenous GRAF1c pro - tein expression was almost completely knocked - down by siRNA , using speciﬁc oligonucleotides ( Figure 1C ; right panel ) . Actin was used as a control for equal protein loading . To assess the potential interaction between MICAL - L1 and GRAF1 , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either HA - GRAF1c , or with a negative control , HA - MAPK ( Mitogen - Activated Protein Kinase ) . The latter control was chosen because it was an unrelated protein with an identical HA - tag to HA - GRAF1c , and its expression was similar to that of HA - GRAF1c . As shown in Figure 1D ( left panel ) , endogenous MICAL - L1 pulled - down HA - GRAF1c but not HA - MAPK ( Figure 1D ; right panel ) . Additional controls were done immunoprecipitating with Protein L beads but without the anti - MICAL - L1 , further conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of this interaction ( Figure S1D ) . However , data from selective yeast two - hybrid assays lead us to suggest that this interaction is likely indirect ( Figure S1A ) . MICAL - L1 , GRAF1 , AND EHD1 ARE COMPONENTS OF A COMPLEX The apparent indirect interaction between GRAF1 and MICAL - L1 led us to query whether these proteins might be linked by a common interaction partner . We have previously demon - strated that MICAL - L1 interacts with EHD1 ( Sharma et al . , 2009 ) , and we now asked whether EHD1 was necessary for the MICAL - L1 / GRAF1 interaction . To this aim , HeLa cells were either mock - treated or depleted of EHD1 by siRNA . The cells were then transfected with either HA - GRAF1 or HA - MAPK ( neg - ative control ) . Lysates from these cells ( Figure 2A ; right panel ) demonstrate that HA - MAPK , HA - GRAF1 , endogenous MICAL - L1 and EHD1 were readily detected by their respective antibodies . The lysates also conﬁrmed that EHD1 expression was completely inhibited by EHD1 - siRNA . Under these conditions , anti - MICAL - L1 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation , and the presence of HA - GRAF1 or HA - MAPK was tested in the immunopre - cipitate . As demonstrated ( Figure 2A ; left panel ) , GRAF1 ( but not the MAPK negative control ) was co - immunoprecipitated by anti - MICAL - L1 antibody in both mock - treated cells and cells EHD1 - depleted cells ( red asterisks ) . Our data promote the notion that EHD1 is not required for the interaction between MICAL - L1 and GRAF1 . The possibility that the interaction between MICAL - L1 and GRAF1 represents a multi - protein complex that includes EHD1 was then tested . MICAL - L1 - depleted cells were transfected with cDNA coding for HA - MARCKS ( Myristoylated alanine - rich C - kinase substrate ; negative control ) or HA - GRAF1 ( Figure 2B ) . HA - MARCKS was selected as a negative control because it Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | Membrane Trafﬁc May 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 22 | 4 Cai et al . GRAF1 vesiculates tubular recycling endosomes FIGURE 2 | GRAF1c , MICAL - L1 , and EHD1 reside in a common complex . ( A ) HeLa cells were either mock - treated or treated with EHD1 - siRNA for 72h . In the ﬁnal 48h of the siRNA treatment , cells were transfected with either HA - MAPK ( negative control ) or HA - GRAF1c . Cells were then lysed with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( right panel shows input ) . Lysates ( left panel ) were incubated with anti - MICAL - L1 antibody . Protein L beads were added to pull - down MICAL - L1 antibody and elution was done by adding SDS loading buffer . Samples were subjected to 8 % SDS - PAGE , followed by blotting with anti - EHD1 , anti - HA , and anti - MICAL - L1 antibodies . ( B ) Cells were either transfected with HA - MARCKS ( negative control ) , or HA - GRAF1c , and then either mock - treated or treated with MICAL - L1 - siRNA ( right panel shows input ) . Rabbit IP Matrix beads were added to the mixture of cell lysate and EHD1 antibody for 3h at 4 ◦ C . Proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS - PAGE , followed by blotting with anti - HA , anti - MICAL - L1 , anti - EHD1 , anti - MICAL - L1 , and anti - Actin antibodies . Red stars indicate GRAF1c pulled down by either MICAL - L1 or EHD1 . was unrelated to the TRE biogenesis and vesiculation process , because of its HA - tag , and because it has a similar molecular weight to GRAF1c . The efﬁciency of MICAL - L1 knock - down is demonstrated in lanes 7 – 8 . EHD1 , HA - MARCKS , HA - GRAF1 , MICAL - L1 , and actin ( loading control ) were detected in the lysate ( input ) with the corresponding antibodies ( Figure 2B ; right panel , lanes 5 – 8 ) . As previously shown , anti - EHD1 readily pulled down endogenous MICAL - L1 ( Figure 2B , lanes 1 – 3 ) but not HA - MARCKS ( Figure 2B , lane 2 ) . In an additional control immunoprecipitation without the speciﬁc EHD1 antibody , no HA - GRAF1c was observed ( Figure S1E ) . However , EHD1 precip - itated HA - GRAF1 even in the absence of MICAL - L1 ( Figure 2B , lane 4 ; see double asterisks ) . This interaction also appeared to be indirect , as suggested by data from yeast two - hybrid assays ( Figure S1A ; right panel ) nor is it regulated by the TRE regulator , Syndapin2 ( Figure S1B ; right panel ) . Taken together , our data support the localization of GRAF1 to a complex containing both MICAL - L1 and EHD1 . GRAF1 SUPPORTS IN VIVO VESICULATION OF TUBULAR RECYCLING ENDOSOMES Endogenous MICAL - L1 decorates TRE and plays an essential role in their biogenesis by recruiting “tubulators” and “vesiculators” ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . Support for the involvement of GRAF1 www . frontiersin . org May 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 22 | 5 Cai et al . GRAF1 vesiculates tubular recycling endosomes in the biogenesis of TRE was obtained using MICAL - L1 as a marker for these structures . As shown in Figure 3A , MICAL - L1 - decorated TRE are readily detected in untreated HeLa cells . However , upon GRAF1 - depletion , there is a striking increase in the length and number of TRE ( Figure 3B ) . Quantiﬁcation of the total area of MICAL - L1 - containing TRE indicates a two fold increase per image ﬁeld upon GRAF1 - depletion ( Figure 3C ) . While the total level of MICAL - L1 , as tested by immunoblot , is not altered by the GRAF1 - knockdown ( Figure S1C ) , the increased number and overall area of TRE at GRAF1 - knockdown suggest a potential role for GRAF1 in vesiculating these endosomes . FIGURE 3 | GRAF1vesiculatesMICAL - L1 - andEHD1 - decoratedmembrane tubules . ( A ) HeLa cells grown on coverslips were either mock - treated or ( B ) treated with GRAF1 - siRNA for 72h .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | Membrane Trafﬁc May 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 22 | 6 Cai et al . GRAF1 vesiculates tubular recycling endosomes To ascertain that these results can be directly attributed to GRAF1 knock - down ( as opposed to off - target effects ) , we trans - fected a siRNA - resistant HA - GRAF1 into the depleted cells ( in Figure 3D , boundary marked with an orange line ) and analyzed the levels of TRE . Expression of the resistant HA - GRAF1 con - struct was conﬁrmed ( see Figure S2D ) . As demonstrated , trans - fected cells in Figures 3D , E had fewer and shorter TRE compared to the neighboring GRAF1 - depleted cells ( Figure 3E ) , conﬁrming that indeed GRAF1 is responsible for the phenotype observed . Whereas GRAF1 - knockdown led to inefﬁcient TRE vesicula - tion , over - expression of HA - GRAF1 induced the opposite effect , causing extensive vesiculation ( Figures 3F – H ) . In Figure 3F a group of transfected cells expressing HA - GRAF1 at variable lev - els is observed ( denoted by asterisks , with 3 asterisks representing the highest level of GRAF1 expression ) . In Figure 3G , the degree of TRE vesiculation is observed in these transfected cells ; in low - expressing HA - GRAF1 cells , a small number of TRE were still visible , but at medium - to - high expression levels , TRE were absent due to extensive vesiculation . TRE are enriched in PA , which selectively recruits MICAL - L1 and Syndapin2 ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . To determine whether GRAF1 - decorated membrane tubules also contain PA , we co - transfected HA - GRAF1 ( at low expression ) along with GFP - Spo20p , a well - characterized PA - binding protein ( Zeniou - Meyer et al . , 2007 ) , ( Figures S2A – C ; see insets ) . Their partial co - localization on tubular structures further supports the notion of GRAF1 association with TRE in vivo . Endogenous EHD1 localizes to a wide range of vesicular and tubular membranes within the cell , including TRE ( Caplan et al . , 2002 ; Cai et al . , 2011 ) , albeit to a lesser degree than MICAL - L1 , presumably because it begins to induce vesicula - tion of these membranes . However , as demonstrated , GRAF1 - depletion induced an increase in endogenous EHD - decorated TRE ( Figures 3I , J ; see insets ) , further supporting the involvement of GRAF1 in the process of vesiculation . GRAF1 PROMOTES VESICULATION OF INCOMING AND OUTGOING ENDOSOMES Since GRAF1 - depletion affects EHD1 - decorated endosomes , this prompted us to further investigate the type of endosomes that serve as target membranes for GRAF1 action . To this aim , in - bound vesicles were visualized by following the uptake of the endogenous GPI - anchored protein ( GPI - AP ) , CD59 . Previous studies have demonstrated that GFP - GPI , a trans - fected GPI - AP model protein , traverses GRAF1 - containing CLICs ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Endogenous CD59 is a typical cargo of the clathrin - independent pathway that associates with micro - domains enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids ( Stulnig et al . , 1998 ) . In mock - and GRAF1 - siRNA - treated HeLa cells , anti - CD59 antibody was incubated with cells to allow binding to surface - CD59 and internalization of antibody - receptor com - plexes . Remaining anti - CD59 on the cell surface was stripped with a short acid - wash , to allow examination exclusively of internalized CD59 . We have previously shown that following 15 min . of incuba - tion with anti - CD59 antibody , CD59 is primarily localized to tubular endosomes that are on route to the endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) ( Cai et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) , and therefore used this incubation time to study incoming tubules . Compared to mock - treated cells ( Figure 4A ) , incoming endosomes con - taining CD59 were extensively tubular upon GRAF1 - depletion ( Figure 4B ; see insets with higher magniﬁcation ) . Note that the bead - like pattern of CD59 is typically obtained post - ﬁxation ( Cai et al . , 2011 ) . We next addressed the potential involvement of GRAF1 in the shaping of two well - established endocytic organelles : sort - ing endosomes ( SE ) and recycling endosomes ( RE ) . To this aim , we addressed the distribution of the small GTP - binding proteins , FIGURE 4 | GRAF1 - depletion induces hyper - tubulation of CD59 - containing endosomes and Rab11 - positive recycling endosomes . Cells grown on coverslips were either mock - treated ( A , C , E ) or treated with GRAF1 - siRNA ( B , D , F ) for 72h .

GRAF1 - depleted cells . In Figures 4C , D , Rab11 - associated RE were mostly punc - tate in mock - treated cells , but displayed a degree of elonga - tion ( short tubules ) upon the loss of GRAF1 . On the other hand , Rab5 - decorated SE did not undergo discernible changes ( Figures 4E , F ) . Taken together , GRAF1 affects membrane - vesiculation of clathrin - independent incoming endosomes as well as RE , but not Rab5 - sorting endosomes . EXIT OF β 1 INTEGRIN FROM THE ENDOCYTIC RECYCLING COMPARTMENT IS DELAYED IN THE ABSENCE OF GRAF1 Vesiculation gives rise to mobile transport vesicles , which move along microﬁlaments , tethered to motor proteins , and unload their cargo at their target destination , and is thus crucial for the process of recycling . Therefore , since MICAL - L1 - and Rab11 - containing RE are target - vesicles for GRAF1 , we hypothesized that GRAF1 - induced vesiculation might directly affect the exit of cargo molecules from the recycling compartment either to the plasma membrane ( PM ) , or to the intracellular degradative path - ways . β 1 integrins are transmembrane proteins that mediate the attachment of the cells to the extracellular matrix . They can be internalized independently of clathrin ( Altankov and Grinnell , 1995 ; Ylanne et al . , 1995 ) , or via clathrin - coated pits ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ; Ezratty et al . , 2009 ) , and recycle through a MICAL - L1 - mediated pathway ( Sharma et al . , 2009 ) . Accordingly , we assessed the involvement of GRAF1 in β 1 integrin exit from the recycling compartment . Cells were mock - treated , or treated with GRAF1 - siRNA , then incubated with β 1 integrin antibody for 1 h to allow internalization , followed by a short acid - strip to remove remaining non - internalized antibody . While similar amounts of β 1 integrin were internalized upon GRAF1 - depletion ( compare Figures 5B to 5A ; quantiﬁed in 5E , 1 h pulse ) , a clear delay in β 1 integrin exit from the recycling compartment was evident upon GRAF1 - depletion ( compare Figures 5D to 5C ; quantiﬁed in 5E , 4 h chase ) . Indeed , we observed a ∼ 25 % delay in the rate of β 1 integrin recycling to the PM and / or degradation in GRAF1 - depleted cells ( Figure 5E ) . THE RHOA - GAP DOMAIN OF GRAF1 IS REQUIRED FOR VESICULATION OF TUBULAR RECYCLING ENDOSOMES To identify the domain ( s ) of GRAF1 responsible for vesiculation , we transfected a series of truncation mutants or HA - GRAF1 point mutations and used the morphology of MICAL - L1 - containing TRE as a readout to measure vesiculation in vivo . A truncated HA - GRAF1 form , containing only the BAR domain ( Figure 6A ; quantiﬁed in Figure 6I ) , displayed a cytoplasmic distribution and had no effect on MICAL - L1 - decorated endosomes ( Figure 6B ) . A form of GRAF1 comprised of only the BAR + PH domains ( Figure 6C ) , extensively localized to MICAL - L1 - decorated TRE ( Figure 6D , see inset ; quantiﬁed in Figure 6I ) . These ﬁndings support previous observations by Lundmark et al . ( 2008 ) char - acterizing the BAR - PH region of GRAF1 as an inducer of static tubular invaginations , incapable of undergoing ﬁssion . Thus , in analogy with the role of the PH domain in linking GRAF1 to PIP2 at the plasma membrane ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , our results sup - port a role for this domain in recruiting GRAF1 to TRE , which also contain PIP2 ( Jovic et al . , 2009 ) . Nevertheless , when the Rho - GAP domain was added to the BAR + PH domains ( without the SH3 domain ) , transfected cells were now devoid of TRE compared to neighboring untransfected cells ( BAR + PH + GAP ; Figures 6E , F ; quantiﬁed in Figure 6I ) . These experiments led to the notion that the Rho - GAP domain may have the ability to vesiculate membranes independently of its SH3 domain , despite the fact that the SH3 domain interacts with Dynamin1 and 2 in vitro ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , it is possible that the recruitment of Dynamin via the GRAF1 SH3 domain may not be required for TRE vesiculation in vivo . To further address the ability of the Rho - GAP domain to vesic - ulate TRE in vivo , site - directed mutagenesis was used to inactivate the Rho - GAP domain ( R412D ) of full - length HA - GRAF1 , giv - ing rise to a “dead - GAP” mutant , incapable of stimulating GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 ( Doherty et al . , 2011 ) . At both high and low expression levels of the R412D GRAF1 mutant ( Figure 6H ) , MICAL - L1 - decorated TRE were preserved ( Figure 6I ; quanti - ﬁed in Figure 6J ) and comparable to those in untransfected cells . Moreover , the association of GRAF1 ( BAR + PH ) with TRE did not require the TRE hub protein , MICAL - L1 or Syndapin2 ( Figures S3A – E ) . Taken together , these data provide evidence for the involvement of the Rho - GAP domain of GRAF1 in TRE vesiculation in vivo . GRAF1 AND EHD1 VESICULATE TUBULAR RECYCLING ENDOSOMES SYNERGISTICALLY IN A SEMI - PERMEABILIZED CELL SYSTEM In vitro experiments with liposomes have demonstrated that N - BAR - domain - containing proteins shape membranes into tubules , or into small vesicles , depending on the local concentration of the BAR domain , its degree of oligomerization and the mem - brane density ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; Ayton et al . , 2009 ) . Our in vivo experiments in this study implicate GRAF1 in the vesic - ulation process ; such membrane sculpting activity might be assisted by other proteins that associate with GRAF1 . Since TRE nonetheless underwent scission in vivo when an over - expressed GRAF1 protein lacking its SH3 domain was introduced into cells ( Figures 6E , F ) , we speculated that the SH3 - interacting scission protein , Dynamin , might be dispensable for TRE vesiculation . Accordingly , we turned to investigate the participation of other putative “co - vesiculators” in this process . Members of the mammalian EHD family ( which do not con - tain a BAR domain ) were likewise implicated in oligomerizing and remodeling membranes in vivo and in vitro ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ; Moren et al . , 2012 ; Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . Human EHD1 , which decorates a wide range of endosomes , including TRE , demonstrated vesiculation - capabilities in vivo , upon ATP hydrol - ysis ( Cai et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) . It is of interest that a common EHD1 / EHD3 ortholog in the lamprey ( I - EHD ) , which displays 83 % identity to both human EHD , cooperates with dynamin to promote vesicle budding and to prevent the generation of long tubular structures ( Jakobsson et al . , 2011 ) . However , depletion of dynamin2 did not lead to elongation of TRE ( Figures S3F , G ) , as might be expected if dynamin2 played an essential role in TRE vesiculation . Indeed , the loss of dynamin appeared to destabilize the tubules ( Figures S3F , G ) . While the reason for this phenotype remains unknown , it is apparent that dynamin2 is not likely to be a major player in the scission of TRE alongside EHD1 and GRAF1 .

Since MICAL - L1 binds to both EHD1 and GRAF1 directly , and indirectly , respectively , and because EHD1 also associates with GRAF1 ( Figure 2B ) , we aimed to assess the impact of both GRAF1 and EHD1 on TRE - scission in a newly devel - oped semi - permeabilized cell system ( Cai et al . , 2013 ) . HeLa cells grown on coverslips were gently perforated with digitonin for 40 s at room temperature and much of the cytosol content was washed away .

This is in line with our previous report ( Cai et al . , 2013 ) and our in vivo observation attributing a role for EHD1 in TRE vesiculation ( Cai et al . , 2012 ) . By itself , GST - GRAF1 caused a milder decrease in TRE levels ( 10 % ) ( Figure 7D and quantiﬁed in 7F ) . However , the addition of both GST - EHD1 and GST GRAF1 together brought about a dramatic loss of TRE ( 57 % decrease , Figure 7E and quanti - ﬁed in 7F ) , suggesting that GRAF1 and EHD1 act synergistically to induce TRE vesiculation in a semi - permeabilized cell system . Interestingly , the truncated GST - GRAF1 ( BAR + PH ) did not alter TRE morphology ( Figures S4A – C ) , possibly due to the absence of as - yet - unidentiﬁed cytoplasmic components that are lacking in the semi - permeabilized system , but are present in cells . Overall , these data support a role for the GRAF1 Rho - GAP domain in vesiculation . DISCUSSION BIOGENESIS OF TUBULAR RECYCLING ENDOSOMES The ERC is considered a morphologically distinct series of mem - branes from early endosomes and comprises a series of vesic - ular and tubular structures that enable sorting and recycling of internalized receptors and lipids back to the plasma mem - brane ( Gruenberg and Maxﬁeld , 1995 ) . The mechanisms involved in the generation of the ERC and the TREs that comprise this compartment are only partially understood . Recent stud - ies support the role of BAR domain - containing proteins such as BIN1 / Amphiphysin ( Pant et al . , 2009 ) and Syndapin2 ( Braun et al . , 2005 ; Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) in TRE biogenesis , and as well as MICAL - L1 ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) and the C - terminal EHD protein , EHD3 ( Cai et al . , 2013 ) . However , once TREs are gener - ated and cargo has been sorted , for recycling to occur there must be efﬁcient vesiculation of these tubular structures . In previous studies , we and others have identiﬁed EHD1 as an ATPase involved in membrane scission and the generation of recycling vesicles ( Jakobsson et al . , 2011 ; Cai et al . , 2012 ) . While the addition of puriﬁed EHD1 and an ATP regenerating system may be sufﬁcient in a semi - permeabilized cell vesiculation assay , in vivo other proteins likely contribute to this process . For exam - ple , recruitment of PLA2 α to tubular membranes may further contribute TRE vesiculation through the generation of lysophos - phatidic acid ( Cai et al . , 2012 ) . We now provide evidence that GRAF1 contributes to TRE vesiculation . VESICULATION OF MEMBRANES BY GRAF1 , EHD1 AND DYNAMIN2 GRAF1 has been implicated in the control of the poorly character - ized CLIC / GEEC endocytic pathway through its ability to regulate the activity of Cdc42 and RhoA ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) ( sum - marized in Figure 8A ) . Via its BAR and PH domains , GRAF1 localizes to incoming tubular and vesicular membrane structures , which carry internalized cargo , including bacterial toxins and ﬂuid phase cargo , as well as the model GPI anchored protein , GFP - GPI ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Formation of CLIC vesicles requires membrane deformation followed by ﬁssion , yet little is known about the driving force for this process . Although dynamin , a ﬁssion protein in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , interacts with the SH3 domain of GRAF1 through its PRD domain ( Figure 8A ) , it appears to be dispensable for membrane FIGURE 8 | Proposed role for GRAF1 in mediating vesiculation of tubular recycling endosomes . ( A ) Key interaction partners of GRAF1 , MICAL - L1 and EHD1 . ( B ) Proposed roles for GRAF1 and EHD1 at the plasma membrane , in the clathrin - independent endocytic pathway [ pathway 2 ] [ ( Cai et al . , 2011 ) and reviewed in Doherty and Lundmark ( 2009 ) ] , and for GRAF1 , MICAL - L1 and EHD1 at tubular recycling endosomes [ pathway 1 ] ; MICAL - L1 is recruited onto TRE by directly binding to phosphatidic acid . It then recruits EHD1 by a direct interaction and interacts indirectly with GRAF1 . EHD1 , and GRAF1 then synergistically vesiculate TRE , giving rise to small and motile recycling endosomes . ﬁssion in the CLIC pathway ( Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ) . Consistent with these ﬁndings , we also observed that dynamin2 is neither involved in the ﬁssion of endosomes containing the GPI - AP , CD59 , nor TRE decorated with MICAL - L1 . Instead , we have demonstrated that EHD1 mediates this vesiculation process ( Cai et al . , 2012 ) . In this study , we show that the GRAF1 - depletion and over - expression of GRAF1 induce hypertubulation and vesiculation of recycling tubules , respectively , in a manner analogous to that of EHD1 ( Cai et al . , 2012 ) . Our data are therefore consistent with the notion that GRAF1 also plays a role in the vesicu - lation of membrane tubules . Membrane curvature induced by BAR - domain may lead to membrane ﬁssion ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; Gallop and McMahon , 2005 ) . However , compared with other BAR - containing proteins , the BAR domain of GRAF1 is rela - tively inefﬁcient in this respect ( Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ) . In agreement with this , the over - expression of the GRAF1 - BAR domain did not enhance the vesiculation of recycling tubules ( Figures 6A , B ) . Nor did it enhance vesiculation when expressed together with the PH domain ( BAR - PH ) ( Figures 6C , D ) . In con - trast , when the GAP domain of GRAF1 was transfected into Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | Membrane Trafﬁc May 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 22 | 12 Cai et al . GRAF1 vesiculates tubular recycling endosomes cells , TRE were extensively vesiculated ( Figures 6E , F ) , whereas the GAP - dead mutant was incapable of promoting vesicual - tion ( Figures 6G , H ) . Overall , our study supports the idea that the GAP domain of GRAF1 plays a role in the vesiculation process . Via its PH domain , GRAF1 was previously shown to pre - dominantly bind to PIP2 ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ) , which is a major phosphoinositide in the plasma membrane . On the other hand , MICAL - L1 binds selec - tively to PA , which is enriched on TRE ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . However , both phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate and PIP2 are also localized to TRE ( Jovic et al . , 2009 ) , potentially mediating docking of GRAF1 on tubular and vesicular endosomes . Although GRAF1 seemingly interacts with both MICAL - L1 and EHD1 indi - rectly ( see Figure 8A ) , MICAL - L1 nevertheless appears to be a major hub that recruits both the components involved in TRE biogenesis ( tubulation ) as well as vesiculation , potentially allow - ing synergistic activity between EHD1 and GRAF1 ( Figure 7 ) . Based on our ﬁndings , we propose that in addition to GRAF1’s characterized roles in CLIC / GEEC regulation and its functions at the plasma membrane ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ; Doherty et al . , 2011 ) ( see Model in Figure 8B ; pathway number 2 , at clathrin - independent invagi - nations ) , GRAF1 is also a component of the vesiculation complex comprised of MICAL - L1 and EHD1 on TRE ( Figure 8B ; pathway number 1 , on TRE ) . Future studies will be needed to determine whether the combined scission activities of EHD1 and GRAF1 are required in vivo to overcome energy barriers , or perhaps are needed to effectively regulate the complex process of recycling from the TRE .
