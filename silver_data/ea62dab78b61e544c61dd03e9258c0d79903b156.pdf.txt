Grubaugh ( nathan . grubaugh @ yale . edu ) Abstract With the emergence of SARS - CoV - 2 variants that may increase transmissibility and / or cause escape from immune responses 1 – 3 , there is an urgent need for the targeted surveillance of circulating lineages . It was found that the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( also 501Y . V1 ) variant first detected in the UK 4 , 5 could be serendipitously detected by the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID - 19 PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses , spike Δ69 - 70 , would cause a “spike gene target failure” ( SGTF ) result . However , a SGTF result is not definitive for B . 1 . 1 . 7 , and this assay cannot detect other variants of concern that lack spike Δ69 - 70 , such as B . 1 . 351 ( also 501Y . V2 ) detected in South Africa 6 and P . 1 ( also 501Y . V3 ) recently detected in Brazil 7 . We identified a deletion in the ORF1a gene ( ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 ) in all three variants , which has not yet been widely detected in other SARS - CoV - 2 lin eages . Using ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 as the primary target and spike Δ69 - 70 to differentiate , we designed and validated an open source PCR assay to detect SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern 8 . Our assay can be rapidly deployed in laboratories around the world to enhance surveillance for the local emergence spread of B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , and P . 1 . .

Main Broadly accessible and inexpensive surveillance methods are needed to track SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern around the world . While sequencing is the gold standard to identify circulating SARS - CoV - 2 variants , routine genomic surveillance is not available in most countries primarily due to a lack of resources and expertise . In the current situation with the identification of the variants of concern B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , and P . 1 , and with the likelihood that more will emerge , a lack of genomic surveillance leaves public health authorities with a patchy and skewed picture to inform decision making . The discovery of B . 1 . 1 . 7 variants causing SGTF results when tested using the TaqPath PCR assay provided labs in the UK and throughout Europe with a ready - made , simple tool for tracking the frequencing of this variant 9 , 10 . As B . 1 . 1 . 7 spread to other countries , TaqPath SGTF results were used as a front line screening tool for sequencing and an approximation for B . 1 . 1 . 7 population frequency 11 . These findings highlight the usefulness of a PCR assay that produces distinctive results when targeting variants in virus genomes for both tracking and sequencing prioritization . The TaqPath assay was not specifically designed for SARS - CoV - 2 variant surveillance , and it has several limitations . The 6 nucleotide deletion in the spike gene at amino acid positions 69 and 70 ( spike Δ69 - 70 ) that causes the TaqPath SGTF is also present in other SARS - CoV - 2 lineages ( Fig . 1 , Supplementary Table 1 ) , most notably Pango lineages B . 1 . 258 detected throughout Europe and B . 1 . 375 detected primarily in the US 12 , 13 , meaning that SGTF results are not definitive for B . 1 . 1 . 7 . Furthermore , too much focus on TaqPath SGTF results will leave blindspots for other emerging SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern that do not have spike Δ69 - 70 . In particular , B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 , which were recently discovered in South Africa and Brazil , respectively , may also be more transmissible and contain mutations that could help to evade immune responses 6 , 7 , 14 . For all of these reasons , a PCR assay specifically designed for variant surveillance would help to fill in many of the gaps about their distribution and frequency . .

Identification of genome targets to differentiate between B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , P . 1 , and other SARS - CoV - 2 lineages . ( A ) Location on the SARS - CoV - 2 genome where the targeted deletions in the ORF1a gene at amino acid positions 3675 - 3677 ( Δ3675 - 3677 ) and the spike gene at amino acid positions 69 - 70 ( Δ69 - 70 ) occur . ( B ) The Nextstrain ‘global build’ ( nextstrain . org / ncov / global ) accessed on 2021 - 01 - 22 showing the phylogenetic representation of 4 , 046 SARS - CoV - 2 genomes colored by the presence of deletions at amino acid positions ORF1a 3575 - 3677 and spike 69 - 70 . ( C - F ) Zooms of large SARS - CoV - 2 clades , which include the variants of concern B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , and P . 1 , containing one or both deletions . A list of SARS - CoV - 2 genomes used in the analysis is available in Source Data Fig . 1 . We analyzed over 400 , 000 SARS - CoV - 2 genomes on GISAID and used custom Nextstrain builds 15 to identify that a 9 nucleotide deletion in the ORF1a gene at amino acid positions 3675 - 3677 ( ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 ) occurs in the B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , and P . 1 variants , but is only found in 0 . 03 % ( 103 / 377 , 011 ) of all other genomes ( Fig . 1 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Within the B . 1 . 351 lineage , however , 18 . 4 % of the sequences do not have ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 ( Supplementary Table 1 , not shown in Fig . 1E ) . Therefore , by designing a PCR assay that targets both ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 an d spike Δ69 - 70 ( Fig . 1A ) , we can detect most viruses from all three current variants of concern ( ORF1a results , Fig . 1B - E ) , differentiate B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( ORF1a and spike results , Fig . 1D - F ) , and provide results similar to TaqPath SGTF to compare dataset ( spike results ) . To create a multiplexed RT - qPCR screening assay for the B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , and P . 1 variants , we designed two sets of primers that flank each of ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and spike Δ69 - 70 and probes specific to the undeleted “wildtype” sequences . As a contro l , we included the CDC N1 primer and probe set that will detect both the wildtype and variant viruses . As designed , testing SARS - CoV - 2 RNA that contains ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and / or spike Δ69 - 70 will generate undetected cycle threshold ( Ct ) values with the specific PCR target sets as the probes cannot anneal to the deleted sequences , but will have “positive” N1 Ct values . This configuration ensures that target failures are likely due to the presence deletions and that there is sufficient virus RNA for sequencing confirmation . Our RT - qPCR conditions are highly similar to our previously published SARS - CoV - 2 multiplex assay 16 , and a detailed protocol is openly available 8 . We evaluated the analytical sensitivity of our multiplexed RT - qPCR assay using synthetic RNA designed based on the original Wuhan - Hu - 1 sequence and a B . 1 . 1 . 7 sequence ( England / 205041766 / 2020 ) . As the B . 1 . 1 . 7 sequence contains both ORF1a Δ3 675 - 3677 and spike Δ69 - 70 and the Wuhan - Hu - 1 sequence contains neither deletion , using these RNAs allows us to fully evaluate the designed primer and probe sets . We tested a two - fold dilution series from 100 copies / µL to 1 copy / µL for both RNA controls in triplicate ( Table 1 ) . Using the Wuhan - Hu - 1 RNA , we found similar detection ( within 1 Ct ) across all three N1 , ORF1a , and spike targets , and all three could detect virus RNA at our lowest concentration of 1 copy / µL , indicating that our primer and probes sets were efficiently designed . Using the B . 1 . 1 . 7 RNA , we again could detect the RNA down to 1 copy / µL with the N1 set , but did not detect any concentration of the virus RNA with the ORF1a and spike sets , confirming the expected “target failure” signature when testing viruses containing both ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and spike Δ69 - 70 . Overall , our PCR screening assay could easily differentiate between SARS - CoV - 2 RNA with and without the ORF1a and spike deletions by comparing the Ct values to the N1 control .

Next , we validated our multiplex RT - qPCR variant screening assay using known COVID - 19 clinical samples that we have previously sequenced ( Table 2 ) . We tested 19 samples from SARS - CoV - 2 lineages without either ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and spike Δ69 - 70 ( classified as “other” lineage , expected outcome = detection with all three primer / probe sets ) , 41 samples from lineages B . 1 . 375 , B . 1 . 2 , and B . 1 . 1 . 50 ( none are current varia nts of concern ) that only have spike Δ69 - 70 ( expected outcome = target failure with the spike set ) , and 16 samples from B . 1 . 1 . 7 that have both ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and spike Δ69 - 70 ( expected outcome = target failure with both the ORF1a and spike sets ) . We found that the expected outcomes were in 100 % agreement with the sequence classification . Importantly , unlike the TaqPath assay SGTF results , we could differentiate between B . 1 . 1 . 7 and other variants that only have the spike deletion , such as B . 1 . 375 that is not currently a variant of concern . Thus , our clinical results demonstrate how our multiplex RT - qPCR assay can detect potential SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern and can be used to prioritize samples for sequencing .

Importantly , this PCR assay should only be used to screen known SARS - CoV - 2 positive clinical samples for the presence of key deletions found in variants of concern ( where autofluorescence will not be a factor ) , and it should not be used as a primary clinical diagnostic . We also suggest using a N1 threshold Ct of 35 for calling target failures in the ORF1a and spike sets and performing whole genome sequencing to confirm the identity of variants . Second , although our assay is suitable for detection of ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 found in the B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 variants , we have not been able to empirically test clinical samples with these variants due to access limitations . We are actively seeking additional clinical samples and laboratory partners to expand our clinical validation . Third , our assay will not be able to detect all B . 1 . 351 viruses . There is a monophyletic clade within the B . 1 . 351 lineage that has ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 filled back in , perhaps due to recombination with viruses that did not have the deletion . How often this is expected to occur is not known , but it demonstrates that continuous monitoring for the presence of ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and spike Δ69 - 70 within the variants of concern will be necessary to ensure that our assay will still be effective . The rapid emergence of the SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern necessitates an immediate roll out of surveillance tools . Although whole genome sequencing is required to definitively identify specific variants , resource and capacity constraints can limit the number of samples that can be sequenced . The ThermoFisher TaqPath assay has demonstrated the value of PCR for variant surveillance , but it is limited to B . 1 . 1 . 7 and cannot differentiate between other viruses containing spike Δ69 - 70 . By targeting two different large nucleotide deletions , ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and spike Δ69 - 70 , our multiplex PCR can rapidly screen for B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , and P . 1 variants and differentiate between non - variants of concern . Thus , our multiplex RT - qPCR variant screening assay can be used to prioritize samples for sequencing and as a surveillance tool to help monitor the distribution and population frequency of suspected variants . Methods Ethics The Institutional Review Board from the Yale University Human Research Protection Program determined that the RT - qPCR testing and sequencing of de - identified remnant COVID - 19 clinical samples conducted in this study is not research involving human subjects ( IRB Protocol ID : 2000028599 ) . The “Yale ID” numbers displayed in Table 2 are not known outside the research group and cannot be used to re - identify any subject . Analysis of public SARS - CoV - 2 genomes All available SARS - CoV - 2 data ( 402 , 899 genomes ) were downloaded on 2021 - 01 - 22 from GISAID and evaluat ed for the presence of ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and spike Δ69 - 70 .

Multiplex RT - qPCR with probes A detailed protocol of our multiplexed RT - qPCR to screen for SARS - COV - 2 B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , and P . 1 variants of concern can be found on protocols . io 8 . In brief , our multiplex RT - qPCR assay consists of the CDC N1 17 , and the newly designed Yale ORF1a Δ3675 - 3677 and Yale spike Δ69 - 70 primer - probe sets ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . We used the NEB Luna universal probe one step RT - qPCR kit with 400 nM of primers , 200 nM of probes , and 5 µL of nucleic acid in a total reaction volume of 20 µL . Thermocycler conditions were reverse transcription for 10 minutes at 55°C , initial denaturation for 1 minute at 95°C , followed by 40 cycles of 10 seconds at 95°C and 30 seconds at 55°C . During validation we ran the PCR for 45 cycles . Differentiation between variants of concern is based on drop - out of the Yale ORF1a and / or Yale spike primer - probe sets ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Limit of detection We used Twist synthetic SARS - CoV - 2 RNA controls 2 ( Genbank ID : MN908947 . 3 ; GISAID ID : Wuhan - Hu - 1 ) and control 14 ( Genbank ID : EPI _ ISL _ 710528 ; GISAID ID : England / 205041766 / 2020 ) to determine the limit of detection of the screening RT - qPCR assay . We tested a two - fold dilution series from 100 copies / µL to 1 copy / µL for both RNA controls in triplicate , and confirmed the lowest concentration that was detected in all three replicates by 20 additional replicates . Validation and sequence confirmation We validated our approach using known SARS - CoV - 2 positive clinical samples . Briefly , we extracted nucleic acid from 300 µL viral transport medium from nasopharyngeal swabs and eluted in 75 µL using the MagMAX viral / pathogen nucleic acid isolation kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Extracted nucleic acid was tested by our multiplexed RT - qPCR assay and then sequenced using a slightly modified ARTIC Network nCoV - 2019 sequencing protocol for the Oxford Nanopore MinION 19 , 20 . These modifications include extending incubation periods of ligation reactions and including a bead - based clean - up step following dA - tailing . MinION sequencing runs were monitored using RAMPART 21 . Consensus sequences were generated using the ARTIC Network bioinformatics pipeline and lineages were assigned using Pangolin v . 2 . 0 18 , 22 . GISAID accession numbers for all SARS - CoV - 2 genomes used to validate our approach are listed in Table 2 . Data availability Genomic data are available on GISAID ( see Table 2 for accession numbers ) . All RT - qPCR data are included in this article , supplementary files , and source data . References 1 .
