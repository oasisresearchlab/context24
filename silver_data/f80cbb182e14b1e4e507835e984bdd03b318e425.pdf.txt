As adhesion molecules , they mediate immune cell trafﬁcking , migration , and immunological synapse formation during inﬂammation and cancer . The recognition of the vital roles of integrins in various diseases revealed their therapeutic potential . Despite the great effort in the last thirty years , up to now , only seven integrin - based drugs have entered the market . Recent progress in deciphering integrin functions , signaling , and interactions with ligands , along with advancement in rational drug design strategies , provide an opportunity to exploit their therapeutic potential and discover novel agents . This review will discuss the molecular modeling methods used in determining integrins’ dynamic properties and in providing information toward understanding their properties and function at the atomic level . Then , we will survey the relevant contributions and the current understanding of integrin structure , activation , the binding of essential ligands , and the role of molecular modeling methods in the rational design of antagonists . We will emphasize the role played by molecular modeling methods in progress in these areas and the designing of integrin antagonists . Keywords : integrins ; structure ; mechanism ; integrin ligand - interactions ; cancer ; inﬂammation ; autoimmune disorders ; antagonists ; rational drug design 1 . Introduction Integrins , selectins , cadherins , immunoglobulins , and mucins comprise ﬁve major families of adhesion molecules [ 1 , 2 ] . These molecules mediate cell interactions in their environment and with the extracellular matrix . Some of these interactions are ﬁrm and stable ; others are weak and short - lived and are vital for various physiological processes . Interactions of adhesion molecules are crucial in an adequately functioning the immune system , including leukocyte trafﬁcking into tissue in healing processes [ 3 , 4 ] and ﬁnding and killing cancer cells [ 5 ] . However , they might also be involved in chronic and acute inﬂammatory diseases and promote cancer growth and metastasis [ 1 ] . Therefore , inhibitors of adhesion interactions have become potential therapeutics [ 1 , 6 ] . Integrins are a family of cell adhesion molecules that mediate cell – cell , cell – extracellular matrix , and cell – pathogen interactions . They fulﬁll vital roles in immune cell trafﬁcking , migration , and immunological synapse formation during inﬂammation and cancer . More - over , their interactions with ligands result in signal transduction pathways through a membrane [ 7 ] . Integrins are large transmembrane heterodimers made of two glycopro - teins , called α and β subunits , non - covalently linked [ 8 ] . There are 18 α and 8 β subunits , which can theoretically assemble into 144 different heterodimers . However , until now , only 24 complexes have been identiﬁed and have functional and tissue speciﬁcity [ 9 ] . Integrins operate as complete receptors in the plasma membrane and bind to various cytoskeletal pro - teins and signaling molecules in the extracellular matrix . Notably , integrins are expressed on cell surfaces in an inactive conformation and are not able to bind ligands and transduce a signal . Their activity is regulated from inside the cells by a process called inside - out sig - naling [ 10 – 12 ] . Several diseases are associated with defects in integrins [ 13 , 14 ] . Therefore , Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / cells12020324 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / cells Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 2 of 44 it is unsurprising that integrins are targets for potential treatment in inﬂammatory diseases and cancer . Several reviews were published on various aspects of integrins , such as inte - grin structure and function [ 7 – 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 – 22 ] , integrins as therapeutic targets [ 14 , 20 , 23 – 28 ] , and integrins in functional biomaterials [ 29 – 31 ] . Therefore , this is not intended to be an exhaustive review of all structural and functional studies on integrins . We want to give the reader an overview of how several molecular modeling methods contributed to shedding some light on the particular features of integrins , such as their structure , conformational behavior , and activation . We will also address the use of molecular modeling methods in the design of ligands and an estimate of their activity and selectivity . 2 . Computational Modeling Methods Proteins perform an enormous diversity of biological functions associated with their naturally evolved three - dimensional ( 3D ) structures , determined by genetically encoded amino acid sequences . Proteins exist as an ensemble of conformations in a dynamic equilibrium , depending on their biological environment , which inﬂuences their functions . From both the experimental and computational points of view , understanding proteins’ dynamic behavior and the characterization of their structural features have been challenging for decades . Experimental data provide information about a single molecule’s properties or ensemble average values . Computational methods provide information on the distribution in the ensemble at the atomic level . Thus , the combinations of experimental and molecular modeling methods provide a unique way to solve this demanding task . It is beyond the scope of this review to give a detailed description of all used computational methods , and in the following chapter , only a brief overview is presented . In the past decades , considerable increases in computing power and several emerging computational methods have provided tools for describing 3D structures and proper - ties of biomolecules , with potentially wide - ranging applications in biology , medicine , pharmacology , biotechnology , and the design of new materials . Current computational approaches span wide - ranging methods from ab initio quantum mechanics ( QM ) to coarse - grained methods . These methods are combined with existing algorithms that scan conﬁgurational space , such as deterministic molecular dynamic simulation ( MD ) , heuristic Monte Carlo method ( MC ) , or enhanced sampling techniques . The choice of the most appropriate method depends on the complexity of the studied system , the details needed for understanding the studied properties or chemical / biochemical processes , and computational resources . 2 . 1 . Quantum Chemistry Methods Until recently , molecular orbital methods , also known as the self - consistent ﬁeld ( SCF ) approximation , were used in QM computations of biomolecules [ 32 , 33 ] . The accuracy of ab initio QM calculations is mainly affected by the quality of the atomic orbitals used to build the molecular orbitals and the inclusion of electron - correlation effects [ 34 ] . Although various methods were developed to include electron correlation , they require a colossal computer effort . Therefore , QM ab initio calculations of the structure and behavior of large systems are restricted . During the past two decades , the density functional theory ( DFT ) method [ 35 ] has become the method of choice for investigations of biomolecular systems due to its satisfactory accuracy and lower computational resources compared to QM ab initio methods . The DFT method describes molecules using the electron density instead of the wave function used in the QM ab initio methods . The reliable exchange - correlation func - tional is crucial for proper DFT calculations , and its quality is constantly improving [ 36 – 38 ] . In particular , the B3LYP functional with the 6 - 31 + G * basis set became the most popular functional for calculating conformational sampling of medium - size molecules . Recently , several new functionals , including M05 - 2X , M06 - 2X , MPW1K , and PWB6K , were developed that reasonably well predict the structure of large biomolecules [ 39 , 40 ] . Then , conforma - tional equilibrium of the ﬁnal set of conformers is usually based on calculated energies performed using the 6 - 311 + + G * * basis set . Despite the considerable progress in QM Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 3 of 44 calculations , the applications of good quality QM methods are limited to relatively small biological systems with a number of atoms ~ 300 , e . g . , the active site of enzymes , or the bind - ing sites of proteins . However , in processes where bond - breaking and bond - forming occur , QM methods are not avoidable . To solve this limitation of QM methods , the combined quantum mechanics – molecular mechanics ( QM / MM ) approach was proposed [ 41 ] and soon became very popular for calculating the enzymatic reaction . In QM / MM methods , the relevant part of the system , such as the active site of an enzyme , is calculated at the electronic level with QM methods . In contrast , the remaining portion of the system is calculated at the atomic level using MM methods . The development and application of QM / MM methods have been presented and discussed in several recent reviews , which readers should refer to for further details [ 42 – 48 ] . The defragmentation methodology is another way to deal with large protein systems at the QM level [ 49 ] . The fragment molecular orbital ( FMO ) method [ 50 , 51 ] is one such ap - proach . The pair interaction energy decomposition analysis ( PIEDA ) with the FMO method was recently used to analyze interaction energies in different biomolecular systems [ 52 – 58 ] . 2 . 2 . Molecular Mechanics ( Force Fields ) Methods A cheaper alternative to expensive QM calculations of the energy of a given biomolec - ular system are molecular mechanics calculations based on the laws of classical mechanics . Molecular Mechanics ( MM ) or Force Field ( FF ) methods consider atoms in molecules as charged spheres linked by springs of different elasticity . MM methods use classical po - tential functions to calculate a molecule’s structure and potential energy in a particular conformation . These equations , together with the set of parameters ( force constants , equi - librium values , and atomic charges ) , determined using structural and thermodynamic experimental or QM data , are called force ﬁelds . The potential energy of a molecule is the function of the position of all atoms . Generally , the potential energy is expressed as the sum of individual functions for bond lengths stretching , bond angles bending , torsional angle energy , electrostatic , non - bonded , and dispersion interactions . It is noteworthy that total energy has no absolute meaning . It serves only as a comparison of different conforma - tions of a particular molecule . MM’s main advantages are considerably lower computing power and CPU time requirements than QM . In the last decade , force ﬁelds have been continuously improved [ 59 – 63 ] . Nowadays , the developed force ﬁelds such as AMBER [ 64 ] , CHARMM [ 60 ] , GROMOS [ 65 ] , and OPLS [ 66 ] provide tools that can address questions related to a protein 3D structure and characterize its conformational ensemble . During many biochemical processes , the charge distribution on atoms usually changes . However , MM calculations calculate electrostatic contributions to a system’s potential energy with ﬁxed atomic charges . Therefore , in the last decade , several attempts were focused on developing general polarizable force ﬁelds for biochemical simulations [ 63 , 67 ] . Of the different methods used to account for polarization in classical MM , the Drude oscillator model [ 68 ] is the most popular and is included in various software suits [ 69 ] . In the last two decades , considerable progress has been made in developing polarizable force ﬁelds and their application to biochemical systems [ 70 ] . Though various improved results were obtained , some challenges remain to be solved [ 63 ] . Additionally , their general applications are hampered by computationally expensive requirements for calculations of large systems . Applications of MM methods to chemical reactions are impossible due to the pre - deﬁned bonding topology , which cannot describe processes when bonds are broken and formed in a chemical reaction . Recently , the ReaxFF method was developed [ 71 , 72 ] . Four force ﬁelds of ReaxFF have been parameterized for biochemical systems [ 73 – 76 ] and em - ployed for molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . Force ﬁelds were established using different training sets and algorithms used for the parameterization . Though the force ﬁeld was not parameterized for glycosyltransferases [ 73 ] , its validation on a real glycosyltrans - ferase ppGalNAT2 led to a reasonable description of the enzymatic reaction comparable to QM / MM DFT calculations [ 77 ] . Although the parametrized force ﬁeld is far from being Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 4 of 44 ﬁnal , the obtained results are encouraging , suggesting that ReaxFF has the potential to describe enzymatic reactions with accuracy similar to QM / MM DFT with a computa - tional cost of 4 – 6 orders of magnitude lower . The performance of developed ReaxFF force ﬁelds was recently evaluated [ 78 ] . It showed that though they perform well for speciﬁc applications , they are mostly not transferable to general applications involving amino acids . Coarse - grained models were developed to speed up simulations of large systems by grouping several atoms into a single particle - bead [ 79 ] . Various schemes were used to deﬁne beads [ 80 ] . The most common is to form one bead from four non - hydrogen atoms . This considerably decreases the system’s dimensionality , accelerating calculation by several orders of magnitude compared to classical MM calculations . Moreover , “bonds” between beads vibrate with lower frequencies , and , as a result , a larger simulation step can be used . On the other hand , lower dimensionality does not allow a proper evaluation of some thermodynamic properties , e . g . , entropy . Of course , coarse - grained force ﬁelds must be developed for biomolecules by using equations describing interactions analogous to those in classical MM force ﬁelds . The Martini force ﬁeld is the most popular model developed for various biochemical systems [ 81 – 83 ] . The coarse - grained models are instrumental in describing systems dominated by macroscopic properties . However , they are inappropriate for phenomena where atomic ( detailed ) interactions are crucial [ 84 ] . 2 . 3 . Molecular Dynamics Simulations Biomolecules are ﬂexible structures that exist as a dynamic ensemble of conformations with equilibrium depending on their free energy surface , a function of a molecular struc - ture . The topology of these high - dimensional surfaces is very complex , with many local minima connected by pathways via barriers due to a vast number of degrees of freedom and depending on the biological environment . Determining the molecular structure by directly applying the above - discussed computational methods using geometry optimiza - tion procedures provides a single structure . Usually , it leads to the nearest local minimum from the starting structure on the energy surface . Since experiments generally provide the ensemble average values , reliable calculations must consider the most relevant structures in dynamic ensemble . In other words , calculations must sufﬁciently sample a particular biomolecular system’s conﬁguration space . The two most common techniques that scan conﬁguration space and provide reasonable ensemble averages are Monte Carlo ( MC ) and molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . These methods can be combined with the energy calculated by QM , QM / MM , or MM FF methods . The MC and MD simulations can determine structures or reﬁne structures from experimental data and characterize a system’s thermodynamic or other parameters at equilibrium . In both cases , the adequate sampling of the conﬁguration space is essential for obtaining the correct Boltzmann - weighted ensemble . To examine the actual dynamics of the biomolecular system , where the changes in the structure and their changes over time are of primary interest , only MD can provide the necessary information [ 85 ] . In MD simulation , conformational sampling is determined using the Newtonian equation of motion applied to the potential energy function of the molecular system [ 86 , 87 ] . Given a starting set of atomic positions and velocities , the force acting on each atom is calculated by taking the potential energy gradient . A tiny step forward in time is required ( typically of the order of a few femtoseconds ) to achieve energy conservation . New positions and velocities are calculated by integrating Newton’s equation of motion using the time - step size and the old positions , velocities , and accelerations . The quality of the method for calculating energy determines whether MD simulations provide a sufﬁcient sampling of the energy surface , whether sampled conformations are realistic , and whether the obtained evolution of molecules over time is credible . 2 . 4 . Enhanced Sampling Algorithms The challenge is that high - energy barriers separate different conformations and tran - sitioning between them requires very long simulations on a multi - dimensional hilly free Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 5 of 44 energy surface . Sampling biologically relevant time scales ( milliseconds ) with femtosecond steps requires more than a trillion integration time steps and calculations of interactions between tens of thousands of atoms at each step . Though the enormous progress in computational resources permits increasing simulation time to the millisecond time scale for millions of atoms [ 88 ] , such simulations of biological systems are far from routine techniques and even require specialized supercomputers . A straightforward approach to accelerate the thermodynamics calculation is to lower the energy barriers on the energy surface , thus increasing the sampling transition regions . Intuitively , this can be achieved by increasing the system’s temperature or by adding bias potential to the system’s energy . Recently , several enhanced sampling methods have emerged that accelerate the dynamics of such systems . The enhanced sampling methods , such as umbrella sampling [ 89 ] , replica exchange molecular dynamics ( REMD ) [ 90 , 91 ] , metadynamics ( MTD ) [ 92 , 93 ] , variationally enhanced sampling [ 94 ] , and integrated tempering sampling [ 95 , 96 ] , belong among the widely used . Interpreting conﬁgurational ensembles from MD simulations data and efﬁcient confor - mational sampling on a high - dimensional energy surface requires reducing the studied problem’s dimensionality . The dimensionality reduction provides structural coordinate ( s ) called collective variables ( CVs ) . The choice of CV is crucial for designing simulations . The values of CVs should clearly distinguish between different conformations of the studied system , should be calculated as a function of atomic coordinates , and their number should be limited [ 97 ] . Simple CVs that meet these conditions represent stereochemical param - eters , such as atom – atom distances , bond and dihedral angles [ 92 ] , a radius of gyration , coordination number , ring - puckering coordinates [ 98 ] , or pharmacophore descriptors [ 99 ] , etc . In addition , their combination can be appropriate in some cases . Many enhanced techniques are included in biomolecular software packages , such as AMBER [ 100 ] , GRO - MACS [ 101 ] , and NAMD [ 102 , 103 ] . The enhanced sampling approaches were recently reviewed [ 84 , 104 – 107 ] . 2 . 5 . Protein Structure Prediction Complications in the cloning , expression , and puriﬁcation of milligram quantities of the protein that affects obtaining a sufﬁcient amount of material and difﬁculties associated with crystallization often hinder the experimental elucidation of a protein structure . In this context , it is not surprising that the development of computational methods predicting protein structure has gained much interest [ 108 , 109 ] . Various computational methods such as homology modeling ( also known as comparative modeling ) , fold recognition and threading , and ﬁrst principles ( ab initio or de novo ) techniques with or without database information were used for protein structure prediction . A homology model of the given protein ( target ) is constructed from its amino acid sequence and an experimental three - dimensional structure of related homologous proteins ( templates ) , based on the assumption that proteins with sequence similarity also have structural similarity [ 110 ] . Usually , homology modeling proceeds with these main steps : the identiﬁcation of related sequences of known structure ; the alignment of the target sequence to the template structures ; the modeling of structurally conserved regions using the known templates ; modeling side chains and loops that are different than the templates ; and ﬁnally , reﬁning and evaluating the quality of the model through conformational sampling by MD simulations . The degree of sequence similarity and the accuracy of template models are decisive factors in the quality of the homology model . Widely used programs for predicting the 3D structure of proteins are MODELLER [ 111 ] , Prime [ 112 , 113 ] , and an Automated Comparative Protein Modelling Server SWISS - MODEL [ 114 ] . It is often impossible to ﬁnd a protein with identity in a pair - wise alignment between target and template proteins higher than 25 % . In this case , the results of homology modeling are unreliable . Instead , protein threading , also known as fold recognition [ 115 ] , can be used for protein modeling . The prediction is made by placing ( threading ) each amino acid in the target sequence to a position in the template structure and evaluating how well the Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 6 of 44 target ﬁts the template . After the best - ﬁt template is selected , the structural model of the sequence is built based on the alignment with the chosen template . Threading works by using statistical knowledge of the relationship between the structures deposited in the PDB and the protein sequence one wishes to model . TREADER [ 116 ] and RaptorX [ 117 ] represents software developed for this method’s application . The structure prediction for proteins lacking structural similarity to a protein in the protein database is highly challenging and requires extensive computer resources . The prediction of protein 3D structures based solely on their primary structure attracted the interest of many computational labs for many years , and several ab initio ( de novo ) approaches were developed [ 108 , 109 , 118 ] . Ab initio methods require accurate energy functions that correctly describe the location and orientation of amino acid side chains , as well as their residue – residue interactions , and can be used for the ﬁnal reﬁnement to provide a high - resolution structure , an efﬁcient conformational sampling strategy , and ranking criteria for a choice of near - native models from an ensemble of models . Despite considerable progress in developing ab initio algorithms , no approach has been able to reliably produce models with atomic accuracy up to now . The breakthrough came in the last year . Two groups have independently developed the deep - learning - based methods AlphaFold2 [ 119 , 120 ] and RoseTTAfold [ 121 ] . AlphaFold2 , developed by DeepMind company , is an artiﬁcial intelligence system that predicts the 3D structure of a protein from the primary structure with accuracy comparable with experiments . Simultaneously , the academic team developed RoseTTAfold , producing similar results [ 122 ] . These novel machine - learning approaches incorporate physical and biological knowledge about protein structure to design deep - learning algorithms . A collab - oration between the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s - European Bioinformatics Institute ( EMBL - EBI ) and DeepMind has predicted structures for over 200 million pro - teins that are freely available at the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database ( the FTP site : https : / / ftp . ebi . ac . uk / pub / databases / alphafold ( accessed on 6 December 2022 ) ) . 2 . 6 . Molecular Docking Ligand binding is a key process in various biological processes and drug design . Therefore , a detailed description of interactions and prediction binding afﬁnity between macromolecular receptors ( proteins / DNA ) and small molecules ( ligands ) is essential for a rational drug design and discovery . Today , a variety of docking algorithms are avail - able [ 123 – 126 ] . The ultimate goal of molecular docking methods is to correctly predict the ligand’s most favorable orientation and position ( pose ) at the binding site of the target macro - molecule . The docking procedure generates multiple conformations , while exploring a whole conformational space is crucial . The methods also estimate the receptor - ligand binding free energy , often using the so - called scoring function . The free energy of binding ∆ G bind , aq characterizes the strength of the interaction between a macromolecular receptor and a particular ligand under equilibrium ( Figure 1a ) and binding afﬁnity . It is noteworthy that knowledge of K A is not necessary to predict the correct complex structure . However , in the case of inhibitors , prediction of their potency is crucial . Intermolecular electrostatic , non - bonded , and hydrogen bonding interactions between receptor and ligand and in - tramolecular structural changes in both molecules determine the magnitude of ∆ G bind , aq . They all contribute to the binding enthalpy . A desolvation and a loss in rotational and translational degrees of freedom contribute to the binding entropy . Figure 1b shows the thermodynamic cycle for a macromolecular receptor and a ligand in the aqueous solution and vacuum that can be used to calculate ∆ G bind , aq in solution . Docking methods require knowledge of the receptor’s 3D structure . Generally , the receptor coordinates are obtained from solved X - ray or NMR structures . If they are absent , the predicted protein models can also be used [ 125 ] . Atomic , surface , and grid represen - tations of receptors are used for docking . A successful docking procedure requires an accurate and efﬁcient sampling of the ligand and receptor ﬂexibility . Various algorithms are Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 7 of 44 used to treat ligand ﬂexibility , such as systematic methods using the conformational search or incremental construction , e . g . , in programs DOCK [ 127 ] , FlexX [ 128 ] , and Glide [ 129 ] ; random or stochastic methods using MC or genetic algorithm , e . g . , in programs Gold and autoDock [ 130 ] ; and simulation methods using MD or MTD simulations , e . g . , in programs DOCK , autoDock , and Glide . Treating receptor ﬂexibility requires considerable computa - tional time ; therefore , a receptor is usually kept rigid . Some programs execute so - called “soft docking” sampling of the conformational space of relevant side chains in the binding site . Docking approaches can be combined with different computational methods for ranking predicted poses . The crucial need is to correctly predict the binding conformation of a ligand and distinguish between correct poses and false ones . Generally , three groups of scoring functions are used : force - ﬁeld - based , empirical - based , and knowledge - based [ 125 ] . Dynamic simulations using MD and enhanced simulation techniques have become possible for molecular docking [ 126 ] . They consider the complete structural ﬂexibility of both a ligand and receptor . Recently , well - tempered metadynamics was successfully applied to design an inhibitor of the α v β 3 integrin [ 131 ] . Though these methods are instrumental in providing quantitative values of the free energy and kinetics of binding , they are too computationally expensive for routine calculations in high - throughput screening .

Structure of Integrins Integrins are membrane glycoproteins composed of α and β subunits that form a heterodimer . Both subunits consist of well - deﬁned domains : a large extracellular domain ( ectodomain ) and a relatively short transmembrane domain with ~ 60 amino acids ( aa ) . The Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 8 of 44 exception is the β 4 integrin [ 132 ] with ~ 1000 aa and cytoplasmic domain [ 20 ] ( Figure 2a ) . The integrin cytoplasmic domain modulates crucial cell processes by interacting with various skeletal proteins and intracellular signaling molecules [ 9 ] . Two subunits in integrin complexes are held together by non - covalent bonds and form a ligand - binding site on the top of the two subunits . The ectodomain of α - chain is larger than that of β - chain : ~ 940 – 1120 aa vs . ~ 700 aa . An α subunit ectodomain consists of two calf domains , a tight , and a seven - bladed β - propeller . The β subunit consists of a β - tail domain , four epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) modules , a hybrid domain with the inserted β I domain , and a plexin - semaphorin - integrin ( PSI ) domain .

Schematic representation of ( a ) an arrangement of domains in the  - and  - subunit of integrins ; ( b ) 24 distinct integrins divided into subfamilies according to their ligand specificities , adapted from ref . [ 8 , 15 ] . 3 . 1 . Glycosylation of Integrins Glycan structures added to integrins by post - translational modifications contribute to their structural and functional diversity [ 133 – 139 ] . The glycosylation of proteins is a step - wise process carried out by glycosyltransferases . Glycosyltransferases ( GTs ) catalyze the transfer of glycosyl residue from a donor to an acceptor molecule [ 48 ] . The N - and O - glycosylations are the most frequent types of glycosylation . There are sufficient data link - ing aberrant glycosylation with pathological conditions , including chronic inflammation , immune diseases , cancer progression , and metastasis [ 48 , 140 – 143 ] . N - glycans presence is crucial for the association of both subunits into heterodimers , their stability , conformation , and interactions with ligands . For example ,  5  1 and  3  1 integrins contain 14 and 12 N - glycosylation sites on  and  subunits , respectively . Their presence is crucial for interac - tions with fibronectin and laminin , mediating cell adhesion , migration , differentiation , and apoptosis [ 134 ] . However , from multiple N - glycosylation sites , only those located on specific motifs have these roles [ 144 , 145 ] . Integrins also contain O - glycans associated with the adhesion and migration of tumor cells , but their functions are less investigated due to difficulties in their isolation . Details about the influence of particular glycan structures and GTs responsible for their biosynthesis can be found in references [ 133 – 135 , 138 ] and are illustrated in Figure 3 . Figure 2 . Schematic representation of ( a ) an arrangement of domains in the α - and β - subunit of integrins ; ( b ) 24 distinct integrins divided into subfamilies according to their ligand speciﬁcities , adapted from ref . [ 8 , 15 ] . There are 18 different found α subunits ( α 1 – α 11 , α v , α IIb , α D , α L , α M , α X , and α E ) and eight found β subunits ( β 1 – β 8 ) . Nine of eighteen α subunits , namely α 1 , α 2 , α 10 , α 11 , α D , α L , α M , α X , and α E , have inserted the α I domain between the second and third blade of the β - propeller , which is crucial for the formation of a ligand binding region . This region also contains a Metal Ion - Dependent Adhesion Site ( MIDAS ) containing divalent cations such as Mg 2 + , Ca 2 + , or Mn 2 + . In the other nine α subunits ( α 3 – α 9 , α v , and α IIb ) , the α I domain is missing , and a β I domain from an α - propeller domain in the α subunit headpiece and the MIDAS in the β subunit are responsible for forming the ligand binding region . In this case , other metal ion sites were also found similar to β I MIDAS ; of the two ADMIDAS ( Adjacent to MIDAS ) sites , one of them is called a synergistic metal ion - binding site ( SYMBS ) . Twenty - four integrins were identiﬁed in humans and can be classiﬁed according to their ligand - binding properties ( Figure 2b ) or tissue expression [ 8 , 15 ] . 3 . 1 . Glycosylation of Integrins Glycan structures added to integrins by post - translational modiﬁcations contribute to their structural and functional diversity [ 133 – 139 ] . The glycosylation of proteins is a step - wise process carried out by glycosyltransferases . Glycosyltransferases ( GTs ) catalyze the transfer of glycosyl residue from a donor to an acceptor molecule [ 48 ] . The N - and O - glycosylations are the most frequent types of glycosylation . There are sufﬁcient data link - ing aberrant glycosylation with pathological conditions , including chronic inﬂammation , Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 9 of 44 immune diseases , cancer progression , and metastasis [ 48 , 140 – 143 ] . N - glycans presence is crucial for the association of both subunits into heterodimers , their stability , conforma - tion , and interactions with ligands . For example , α 5 β 1 and α 3 β 1 integrins contain 14 and 12 N - glycosylation sites on α and β subunits , respectively . Their presence is crucial for in - teractions with ﬁbronectin and laminin , mediating cell adhesion , migration , differentiation , and apoptosis [ 134 ] . However , from multiple N - glycosylation sites , only those located on speciﬁc motifs have these roles [ 144 , 145 ] . Integrins also contain O - glycans associated with the adhesion and migration of tumor cells , but their functions are less investigated due to difﬁculties in their isolation . Details about the inﬂuence of particular glycan structures and GTs responsible for their biosynthesis can be found in references [ 133 – 135 , 138 ] and are illustrated in Figure 3 .

The ﬁrst 3D structure of an integrin was the crystal structure of the integrin ectodomain for α v β 3 [ 146 ] . Up to now , there are more than 100 solved structures concerning various integrins’ parts , usually in complex with different ligands .

In this section , we will discuss some solved structures of integrins , as well predicted 3D structures by homology modeling . Integrins play an essential role in the immune system by mediating leukocyte adhesion and their transmigration from blood to tissue during leucocyte adhesion [ 150 ] . Therefore , it is unsurprising that integrins involved in immunological functions were studied more intensively than others . The α X β 2 integrin was the ﬁrst solved structure of the ectodomain Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 10 of 44 containing the α I domain [ 151 ] . The integrins α v β 3 and α IIb β 3 belong to the most investi - gated . These integrins are present on platelets and are associated with platelet functions in hemostasis and thrombosis , and they also participate in cancer progression [ 152 ] . The crystal structures of the complete integrin α v β 3 ectodomain plus α / β transmembrane fragment [ 153 ] and the intact integrin α IIb β 3 in a nanodisc lipid bilayer were solved re - cently [ 154 ] . Both integrins adopted a similar bent conformation , in which the ligand binding site is near the membrane surface . The crystal structures of an α I - containing α X β 2 ( PDB entry 4NEH ) and α I - lacking integrins α v β 3 ( PDB ﬁle 3IJE ) and α IIb β 3 ( 4CAK ) are shown in Figure 4 . Cells 2022 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 48 Figure 4 .

The solved crystal structures of integrin ectodomains and I domains [ 7 , 20 , 21 , 149 , 155 ] revealed that integrins exist during activation in the dynamic equilibrium of at least three major conformers : bent - closed ( BC ) , open - closed ( OC ) , and open - extended ( OE ) ] [ 7 , 156 , 157 ] . Three conformers are schematically shown in Figure 5 . Interactions of integ - rins with extracellular and cytosolic ligands ( activators ) trigger a large conformational movement that changes conformational equilibrium . In the absence of a ligand , a salt bridge interaction between helices of the cytoplasmic tails of  and  subunits hold the resting integrin in a low - affinity conformation [ 158 ] . Interactions of some protein activa - tors , e . g . , talin , with CT of  - subunits and membrane break this salt bridge , separate the  - and  - subunits , and the integrins switch to an extended conformation [ 159 ] of the  and  ectodomains that retains its low ligand affinity . Then , integrins interacting with extracellular ligands change to an open - extended , high - activity conformation [ 160 ] . It was observed [ 161 ] that after activation , integrins form ~ 100 nm clusters of ~ 50 integrins as - sisted in an early adhesion of cells . Recently , the conformational equilibriums of three conformers of the  5  1 integrin have been investigated by kinetics measurements using three different ligands [ 156 ] . The determined values of the free energy  G for the bent - closed ( BC ) and the extended - closed ( EC ) conformer are in the range from − 1 . 2 kcal / mol to − 1 . 8 kcal / mol and − 0 . 7 kcal / mol to - 1 . 2 kcal / mol , respectively , compared to the extended - open ( EO ) conformer (  G EO = 0 . 0 kcal / mol ) . For the cyclic RGD peptide ( cRGD ) as the ligand , the values are  G BC = − 1 . 5 kcal / mol ,  G EC = − 1 . 1 kcal / mol , and  G EO = 0 . 0 kcal / mol corresponding to the population of x ( BC ) : x ( OC ) : x ( OE ) = 64 . 3 % : 31 . 3 % : 4 . 6 % . Interestingly , the authors also found that variation in the N - glycosylation site number modulates conformational equilibria . The re - sults revealed that bent - closed and extended - closed conformations are stabilized by a lower number of N - glycosylation sites on integrin  5  1 [ 156 ] . The  I domain is the ligand - binding site in the integrins containing this domain . Structural studies of the  I domains (  2 ,  M , and  L ) complexed with a ligand and with - out a ligand revealed three distinct conformations : closed , intermediate , and open [ 162 – 165 ] ; it was suggested that the closed conformation that lacks a ligand is the most stable [ 7 ] . The  I domain possesses a Rossmann fold , and at the C - terminal end of the central  - sheet is a MIDAS binding motif that coordinates a divalent - metal binding site . The crystal structure of  L  2 also revealed the presence of a ligand - induced allosteric site [ 166 ] . In contrast , integrins lacking the  I domain bind ligands in a binding site of the  I domain that is homologous to the  I domain .

The results revealed that bent - closed and extended - closed conformations are stabilized by a lower number of N - glycosylation sites on integrin α 5 β 1 [ 156 ] . The α I domain is the ligand - binding site in the integrins containing this domain . Structural studies of the α I domains ( α 2 , α M , and α L ) complexed with a ligand and without a ligand revealed three distinct conformations : closed , intermediate , and open [ 162 – 165 ] ; it was suggested that the closed conformation that lacks a ligand is the most stable [ 7 ] .

Molecular Modeling of Integrins ’ Structures Simultaneously with an effort to describe the 3D structure and conformational dy - namic of integrins using experimental methods , molecular modeling methods were ap - plied to provide additional information and aimed to fill the gaps in missing experimental data . The first homology model of an integrin was constructed in 1992 for the  - integrin EF hand - like sequence using the calmodulin sequence as a template [ 167 ] . A computa - tional approach was used to design mutations that stabilized the  I domain of the  M  2 integrin in either the open or closed conformation [ 168 ] . The analysis of the predicted mu - tants revealed that the conformational change in  I domain mediates ligand binding and that computationally proposed ligands are more active than previously suggested lig - ands . Up to now , there are no crystal structures reported for the leukocyte integrin  4  1 . The first step in generating a complete 3D structure of  4  1 was a homology model of  - subunits , including a bound Mg 2 + ion [ 169 ] . The model was constructed using the I domain of integrin CD11B / CD18 containing Mg 2 + ion as the template [ 170 ] . Then , several steps of restrained energy minimization and molecular dynamics , followed by a final minimiza - tion , were used to obtain the final homology model . The ligand - binding mechanism of the  4  1 integrin was studied by docking various molecules , including the vascular cell ad - hesion molecule ( VCAM - 1 ) , into the active site of the model . The results shed light on the interactions of  4 with its ligands and explained the binding mechanism of  4  1 with the native ligand VCAM - 1 . Additionally , a qualitative explanation of the ligand binding se - lectivity between  4  1 and  4  7 was proposed . Figure 5 .

Up to now , there are no crystal structures reported for the leukocyte integrin α 4 β 1 .

The model was constructed using the I domain of integrin CD11B / CD18 containing Mg 2 + ion as the template [ 170 ] . Then , several steps of restrained energy minimization and molecular dynamics , followed by a ﬁnal minimization , were used to obtain the ﬁnal homology model . The ligand - binding mechanism of the α 4 β 1 integrin was studied by docking various molecules , including the vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM - 1 ) , into the active site of the model . The results shed light on the interactions of β 4 with its ligands and explained the binding mechanism Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 12 of 44 of α 4 β 1 with the native ligand VCAM - 1 . Additionally , a qualitative explanation of the ligand binding selectivity between α 4 β 1 and α 4 β 7 was proposed . The solved crystal structures of the complete unconstrained ectodomain plus short C - terminal transmembrane stretches of the & # ; V and & # ; 3 subunits of the α v β 3 inte - grin [ 146 , 153 ] made it possible to construct a model for the ectodomain of the human α v β 5 integrin [ 171 ] . Homology modeling used the crystal coordinates of α v β 3 in its bound conformation as a template . The modeled receptor was reﬁned using energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent . The resulting α v β 5 model was used to investigate a ligand binding selectivity toward α v β 3 and α v β 5 by docking various ligands into both integrins . Comparison of both structures and docking results explained the binding differences of both integrins by revealing that ligands with bulky substituents neighboring the carboxylate group are hampered by a “roof” presented on the top of the MIDAS region in α v β 5 . The homology of the platelet integrin α IIb β 3 has also been reported [ 172 ] . At the time of generating the homology model of the α IIb N - terminal portion of integrin α IIb β 3 , the high - resolution structures of integrin α IIb β 3 were unavailable . The reﬁned model was validated experimentally . The homology model revealed structural features responsible for the α IIb β 3 integrin function and proposed an interpretation of the role of naturally occur - ring mutations that produce Glanzmann thrombasthenia . However , more than 38 crystal structures related to integrin α IIb β 3 are now available that provide information on the mechanism of the α IIb β 3 integrin function [ 20 ] . The homology model of the extended full - length integrin α IIb β 3 was generated based on the crystal structures of the α v β 3 ectodomain [ 146 , 173 ] and on the β 2 PSI / hybrid / I - EGF1 - 3 construct [ 174 ] , including of computer models of the TM helices [ 175 ] . The model was complemented with N - and O - glycans , computer models of the TM helices , and NMR structures of the cytoplasmic domains [ 176 – 178 ] . The generated models were ﬁt in the EM⁄ET maps , and their hy - drodynamic parameters were then computed and compared with the experimental data . Later , the authors [ 179 ] reﬁned this model ( Figure 6a ) using the new crystallographic structure of the integrin α IIb β 3 ectodomain [ 180 ] and the NMR structures of its transmem - brane / cytoplasmic segments [ 181 ] . Cells 2022 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 48 The solved crystal structures of the complete unconstrained ectodomain plus short C - terminal transmembrane stretches of the  V and  3 subunits of the  v  3 integrin [ 146 , 153 ] made it possible to construct a model for the ectodomain of the human  v  5 integrin [ 171 ] .

The homology of the platelet integrin  IIb  3 has also been reported [ 174 ] . At the time of generating the homology model of the  IIb N - terminal portion of integrin  IIb  3 , the high - resolution structures of integrin  IIb  3 were unavailable . The refined model was validated experimentally . The homology model revealed structural features responsible for the  IIb  3 integrin function and proposed an interpretation of the role of naturally occurring mutations that produce Glanzmann thrombasthenia . However , more than 38 crystal structures related to integrin  IIb  3 are now available that provide information on the mechanism of the  IIb  3 integrin function [ 20 ] . The homology model of the extended full - length integrin  IIb  3 was generated based on the crystal structures of the  v  3 ecto - domain [ 146 , 175 ] and on the  2 PSI / hybrid / I - EGF1 - 3 construct [ 176 ] , including of com - puter models of the TM helices [ 177 ] . The model was complemented with N - and O - gly - cans , computer models of the TM helices , and NMR structures of the cytoplasmic domains [ 178 – 180 ] . The generated models were fit in the EM ⁄ ET maps , and their hydrodynamic parameters were then computed and compared with the experimental data . Later , the au - thors [ 172 ] refined this model ( Figure 6a ) using the new crystallographic structure of the integrin  IIb  3 ectodomain [ 181 ] and the NMR structures of its transmembrane / cytoplas - mic segments [ 182 ] .

Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 13 of 44 The recently developed deep - learning method AlphaFold [ 119 ] has been used to generate a homology model of the α 4 β 1 integrin [ 182 ] . AlphaFold produced 25 partially optimized homology structures , including a pLDDT scoring function that evaluates the intra - domain conﬁdence interval . Structures of all homology models were superposed using the USCF ChimeraX program . The analysis of overlapped 3D structures revealed only slight differences in non - structuralized loops . The selected homology model , based on pLDDT , was optimized , and its stability was evaluated with MD simulation using AMBER . The ﬁnal 3D homology model of the α 4 β 1 integrin is shown in Figure 6b , together with the homology structures of the α subunit ( Figure 6c ) , and β subunit ( Figure 6d ) . 4 . The Biological Function of Integrins Integrins possess a rare ability to transduce signals across the plasma membrane in both directions . The so - called outside - in signaling is mediated by ligand binding to an inte - grin ectodomain , upon which a conformational change occurs and a signal is transmitted to the cell . Conversely , interactions of cytoplasmic domains with cytoskeleton proteins or signaling molecules dynamically regulate the activation or deactivation of integrins by so - called inside - out signaling [ 7 , 183 ] . Integrins interact with a vast number of proteins from the extracellular matrix , with molecules on the surface of other cells and soluble proteins , and thus mediate a wide range of physiological processes . After their activation , integrins form adhesion complexes , the so - called adhesome that transduces adhesion - dependent signals to control many cellular functions [ 184 ] . Integrins transduce signals bi - directionally through the plasma membrane between extracellular and cytoskeletal space [ 18 , 185 , 186 ] . Extracellular ligand binding to the integrin headpiece ( i . e . , ﬁbronectin or collagen ) or an external force [ 12 ] triggering signal transmission from the extracellular to the cytoskeleton is called outside - in activation , while the binding of intracellular activators ( i . e . , talin or kindling ) to the cytoplasmic tails leading to signal transmission from inside the cell to outside the cell is called inside - out activation . The integrin signaling is associated with con - formational changes in both subunits of integrins and integrin clustering , and is responsible for activating integrins . Various pathways were discussed in the literature [ 11 , 187 ] , and molecular dynamics simulation methods have been used to decipher the conformational dynamics of integrins during activation . The MD simulations also provided valuable information on the atomic level and complemented experimental data about the dynamics of integrin – ligand interactions . 4 . 1 . Molecular Simulations of Integrins’ Conformational Dynamics Interestingly , probably the ﬁrst dynamics study on integrins was the use of a Brownian dynamics algorithm to simulate the cytoskeleton - mediated transport of an integrin on the dorsal surfaces of migrating ﬁbroblasts published in 1994 [ 188 ] . The results suggested that besides a diffusion / limited process , direct transport is also necessary for the delivery of integrins to the adhesion area . The integrins α v β 3 [ 131 , 187 , 189 – 196 ] and α II β 3 [ 185 , 197 – 202 ] are the two most inves - tigated integrins by molecular dynamics . This is quite understandable , as these integrins belong to the RGD group with several crystal structures available and are associated with various human diseases . The α v β 3 and α II β 3 integrins both lack the α I domain . The prevailing MD simulations have focused on understanding activation and transition from bent to extended conformations initiated by inside - out and outside - in signaling . The β I domain in integrins lacking the α I domain contains three metal binding sites . The presence of a MIDAS metal ion was conﬁrmed by the crystal structure of the α II β 3 and α v β 3 integrins [ 173 , 203 ] . Two additional binding sites close to MIDAS were designated as AMIDAS and ligand - associated metal binding sites ( LIMBS ) . To clarify the function of LIMBS on the binding behavior of physiological ligands to β 3 integrins , the MD and steered MD ( SMD ) simulations were combined with the experiment [ 204 ] . The starting structure for simulations was the crystal complex of the α II β 3 integrin fragment with eptiﬁbatide [ 203 ] and its β 3 LIMBS D217A mutant . The experimentally obtained data suggested that the Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 14 of 44 D217A mutation affected β 3 structure and the binding of ligands . On the other hand , SMD simulations demonstrated that removing the metal ion from LIMBS decreases the ligand binding afﬁnity . Moreover , the more signiﬁcant effect was seen without metals in the MIDAS and LIMBS , suggesting that the LIMBS D217A mutant lacked both metal ions . The FMO PIEDA analysis demonstrated that the MIDAS and LIMBS ions are more critical for binding eptiﬁbatide than is the ADMIDAS ion [ 205 ] . The interactions between the cyclic Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) peptide and divalent cation within the integrin binding site were explored using equilibrium MD simulations [ 190 ] . In addition , non - equilibrium SMD simulations were used to describe how the α v β 3 - RGD ligand complex dissociates under force . Structural models for these simulations were based on the crystal structure of the α v β 3 integrin in complex with the RGD ligand [ 173 ] . Computations revealed that the key interaction between the α v β 3 and RGD ligand is between the metal and Asp ( RGD ) and demonstrate a crucial role of a single water molecule stabilizing the α v β 3 - RGD ligand complex by simultaneously binding to a MIDAS divalent metal ion and Asp ( RGD ) . It is noteworthy that simulations also found that Asp ( RGD ) interacts with both metal ions from MIDAS and LIMBS sites . The role of binding a ﬁbronectin ( Fn ) module to the headpiece of the α v β 3 integrin on integrin activation was investigated by performing MD and SMD simulations [ 195 , 206 ] . For the simulations , the RGD ligand in the crystal structure [ 173 ] was replaced by the RGD - containing 10 th type III ﬁbronectin module ( FnIII 10 ) . Simulations showed that the closed β I / hybrid domain opens spontaneously and is accelerated by binding FnIII 10 and ligand - mediated forces . Molecular insight into the outside - in activation of the α v β 3 integrin triggered by binding glycoprotein ﬁbronectin models 9 and 10 ( FnIII 9 and FnIII 10 ) was obtained using MD simulations [ 207 , 208 ] . The results showed that the binding of FnIII 9 and FnIII10 in - duced by the presence of Mn 2 + is associated with a change in the conformational dynamics observed in both α v and β 3 domains . These changes contributed to α v β 3 integrin activa - tion , resulting in closed to extended conformation change . In this conformational change , the movement of the α 1 helix in the β I domain played a relevant role . MD simulations were performed on the full - length ectodomains , but the parts of transmembranes and cytoplasmic domains were not considered . In the integrin lacking the α I domain , the β I domain ﬂanked by hybrid domains contains the primary binding site of the integrin where the ligand binds via MIDAS . MD simulations were used to characterize the movement of β I / hybrid domains of the β 3 subunit of the α v β 3 integrin in both open and closed headpiece conformations [ 193 ] . Based on MD simulations , the authors proposed that α 7 and α 1 helices from the β I domain initiate in a simultaneous action a signiﬁcant interdomain conformational transition observed in integrin activation . Forced unbending of a complete ectodomain of the α v β 3 integrin in both unliganded and liganded forms was studied using an all - atom explicit solvent MD [ 194 ] . In the closed conformation of the α v β 3 integrin , β I and hybrid domains were based on the crystal structure of the α v β 3 integrin ectodomain [ 209 ] . The open conformation was generated from the open headpiece of the α IIb β 3 integrin [ 203 ] . Simulations of pulling the head of both unliganded and liganded forms of the α v β 3 integrin using a force induced a gradual transition from the bent to the extended conformation . At the same time , the domains were not signiﬁcantly distorted . The results of the simulation of the unbending transition for the unliganded form is shown in Figure 7 . The simulation showed the signiﬁcance of the nonpolar interaction between the hybrid and EGF4 domains for stabilizing the bent conformation and that in the extended conformation , Asp457 from the thigh domain moved to coordinate the Ca 2 + ion at the α v subunit , suggesting that these polar interactions stabilize the extended conformation .

The self - association dynamics of the  II  3 and  L  2 integrins transmembrane do - mains have been investigated using coarse - grain ( CG ) MD simulations [ 197 ] . High se - quence homology between both integrins allowed for the generation of the  L  2 homol - ogy model based on the crystal structure of  II  3 [ 182 ] .

Reprinted with permission from ref . [ 194 ] . The self - association dynamics of the α II β 3 and α L β 2 integrins transmembrane do - mains have been investigated using coarse - grain ( CG ) MD simulations [ 197 ] . High se - quence homology between both integrins allowed for the generation of the α L β 2 homology model based on the crystal structure of α II β 3 [ 181 ] . Compared to α II β 3 , the α L β 2 integrin contains in the TM sequence a polar residue in its α L ( Ser ) and β 2 ( Thr ) subunit , respec - tively , that is involved in hydrogen bonding . The TM models were embedded into the DPPC lipid bilayer and a periodic cubic water box . CG MD simulations using the GRO - MACS package [ 210 ] and Martini force ﬁeld [ 211 ] revealed that polar interactions play an important role in packing helices . Simulations showed that the α L β 2 TM packing is almost Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 16 of 44 optimal and is more speciﬁc , while the packing of the α II β 3 was found to be suboptimal . Simulations of the T686G mutants that have a disrupted hydrogen bond showed a poorer subunits association supporting a signiﬁcant role of polar residue on the association of TMs . The calculated free energy of the association predicted a lower minimum for the α L β 2 . MD simulation and homology modeling were carried out on the complete extracellular domain of the β 3 subunit of the α II β 3 integrin [ 198 , 212 ] . The results indicated that the mutant at the 33 position does not affect the conformational dynamics of β 3 . The main effect was a change of conformational equilibrium to more rigid structures , which might inﬂuence the binding properties of the α II β 3 integrin in a studied mutant . All - atom MD simulations investigated the inside - out activation of the platelet integrin α II β 3 triggered by talin [ 200 ] . MD simulations were performed on the constructed model of the entire TM , cytoplasmic tails ( CT ) of the α II β 3 integrin embedded in a lipid membrane , the explicit water environment , and also in the presence of the talin - 1 F2 and F3 subdomains using the CHARMM27 force ﬁeld [ 213 ] . The 5 µ s simulations provided insight into the inside - out activation at the atomic level , suggesting a preferred conformation of the entire TM - CT α II β 3 domain and proposed crucial interaction in the α II β 3 - talin complex . Structural changes in the transition from low - afﬁnity bent conformation to high - afﬁnity extended conformation were studied on the full - length α v β 3 integrin using all - atom MD and a coarse - grained heterogeneous elastic network model ( hENM ) [ 189 ] . The full - length α v β 3 integrin was constructed from crystal structures of the bent headpiece [ 153 ] and transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts [ 214 ] . Simulations provide new information about structures along switchblade and deadbolt pathways from bent to extended conformation . The results also support the hypothesis that weakening long - range interactions between distant domains that binding activators can trigger are responsible for transitioning from bent to extended conformation . Integrins mediate extracellular matrix stiffness sensing by cells and serve as sensors of mechanical signals [ 12 ] . It was suggested that the integrin provides a rigidity - sensing mechanism through conformational dynamics during ligand binding [ 215 ] . Coarse - grained MD simulations [ 191 ] were conducted to investigate how forces applied to the α v β 3 integrin inﬂuence its conformational dynamics and mechanical signaling ( mechanotransduction ) . The CG computational model of the wild - type α v β 3 integrin and several mutants were developed from crystal [ 214 ] and NMR [ 214 ] structures . The results of CG MD simulations were backmapped to all - atom models , inserted into a lipid bilayer , and hydrated . Then , constant - force SMD was performed on systems containing 1 . 9 million atoms for the wild - type α v β 3 integrin and 2 . 2 million atoms for the mutant . The computations revealed that the activated mutant requires lower force for transition to a high - afﬁnity conformation than does the wild - type integrin . Consequently , cellular - stiffness - sensing correlates with integrin conformational ﬂexibility , supporting the role of integrins as true mechanosensors [ 191 ] . The structure of the entire model of the α v β 3 integrin was generated [ 187 ] using crystal structures of the α v β 3 integrin ectodomain [ 216 ] , and the homology model of the transmem - brane domain based on the crystal structure of the α IIb β 3 integrin [ 181 ] . Then , the α v β 3 integrin model was glycosylated and imbedded into a dipalmitoyl - phosphatidylcholine membrane and used for MD and SMD simulations carried out with the software package GROMACS [ 210 ] . Outside - in activation was studied using an applied force to the extra - cellular domain , and the inside - out activation was investigated by binding talin to the connected or separated cytoplastic tails . Simulations supported the switchblade model , similar to that suggested for the α IIb β 3 integrin [ 186 ] , for both the outside - in and inside - out activation . A mechanism of the inside - out signaling of integrins mediated by the interaction of Kindlin2 to the cytoplasmic domain was investigated using “rampclamp” SMD sim - ulation [ 217 ] . The crystal structure of the Kindlin2 complex with the β 3 integrin [ 218 ] imbedded in a rectangular box of water was utilized as the starting structure . The NAMD software package [ 102 , 103 ] and CHARMM27 force ﬁeld [ 213 ] were used for the calculations . Simulations showed that 17 hydrogen bonds ( ﬁve strong ) altogether were responsible for Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 17 of 44 the stability of the equilibrated complex and integrin activation . SMD simulations using var - ious forces revealed the catch - slip bond mechanism for the Kindlin2 - β 3 integrin interaction . Binding of the RGD containing the 10th domain of ﬁbronectin ( FnIII10 ) to extended conformations of the α v β 3 integrin was investigated using MD simulations . A crystal structure of the FnII10 - α V β 3 integrin complex [ 219 ] was used as a starting structure of the open headpiece conformation . The structure of the extended conformation was constructed using β I and hybrid domains from the crystal structure of the open form of α II β 3 [ 181 ] . Simulations showed that efﬁcient ﬁbronectin binding requires open conformation of the α V β 3 integrin . A combination of AFM measurement and MD and SMD simulations [ 220 ] was used to elucidate the strength of binding a β 2 subunit of the α L β 2 and α M β 2 integrins to intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) . The binding strengths of complexes of β 2 subunits with the Ca 2 + ion in the MIDAS were evaluated using SMD simulations . Simula - tions models were generated from crystal structures of the α L β 2 and α M β 2 integrins with ICAM - 1 [ 220 , 221 ] . Simulations showed that interactions in the α M β 2 - ICAM - 1 complex are stronger than those in the α L β 2 - ICAM - 1 complex , in agreement with AFM data . These results suggest that neutrophil adhesion under shear ﬂow in the blood is dominated by ICAM - 1 interactions with the α L β 2 integrin . 4 . 2 . Integrins’ Activation In the last decade , understanding of the details of both biochemical [ 13 , 157 , 222 – 225 ] and mechanical [ 12 , 226 – 228 ] integrin signaling ( Figure 8 ) has signiﬁcantly advanced . In - tegrins exist in an equilibrium of several conformations that represent different afﬁn - ity states . The above - selected MD papers helped to understand their conformational dynamics and regulation . Simulations of integrins’ interactions with talin , kidlin , and ﬁbronectin [ 193 , 195 , 200 , 206 – 208 , 217 , 219 ] and simulations of a force inﬂuence on the confor - mation of integrins [ 187 , 190 , 191 , 194 ] decipher interactions associated with the outside - out , inside - out , and mechanical signaling ( mechanotransduction ) at the atomic level .

( a ) Inactive integrin ; ( b ) in - side - out activation triggered by binding ligands to the cytoplasmic tail of  subunit ; and ( c ) outside - in activation by interactions with ECM . The biosynthesis of integrins is concluded by post - translational modification , such as glycosylation , in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus . The mature integrins are then transported to the plasma membrane in the bent inactive conformation ( Figure 8a ) . On the membrane , integrins must be activated to be involved in interactions with ECM proteins . Activation can be simplified as the transit from the inactive bent - closed conformation through the extended - closed and extended - primed to the high - affinity ex - tended - open [ 11 , 12 , 225 ] . The first step of the activation in the inside - out mechanism in - volves the binding of talin to the cytoplasmic tail of the  subunit . This binding with the extracellular metal and ECM forces an unbent integrin , replaces the intracellular inhibitor , and separates  and  subunits . Inside - out signaling is supported by the binding of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and kidlin and , thus , regulates affinity for extracellular ligands and clustering of integrins ( Figure 8b ) . In addition , other effectors , such as paxillin , actin , and myosin , influence the adhesion maturation of integrins . Interactions of integrins with adhesion proteins control various signaling pathways , called outside - in signaling , crucial for multiple cell processes dependent on integrins . In outside - in activation , the binding of ligands triggers a conformational change of the  I domain , referred to as headpiece open - ing . On the cell surface , integrins are under the influence of the force induced by gly - cocalyx covering the cell surface and the forces between cells and ECM . These forces in - fluence their conformation equilibrium and , thus , ligand binding properties , activation , and clustering . Therefore , an external force operating from ECM regulates integrin func - tions and is called the outside - in activation ( Figure 8c ) . MD simulations support the role of force [ 181 , 187 , 191 , 194 , 206 ] . Structural changes observed in the transition of integrins from the low - affinity bent conformation to the high - affinity extended conformation dur - ing their activation are relevant in designing modulators of their biological function with potential therapeutic use . The  v  3 and  II  3 integrins dominate MD simulations due to a number of their solved 3D structures . However , with an increasing number of X - ray or NMR 3D structures and reliable homology models , it is reasonable to assume that the remaining integrins will also be studied using molecular modeling methods .

These forces inﬂuence their conformation equilibrium and , thus , ligand binding properties , activation , and clus - tering . Therefore , an external force operating from ECM regulates integrin functions and is called the outside - in activation ( Figure 8c ) . MD simulations support the role of force [ 180 , 187 , 191 , 194 , 206 ] . Structural changes observed in the transition of integrins from the low - afﬁnity bent conformation to the high - afﬁnity extended conformation during their activation are relevant in designing modulators of their biological function with potential therapeutic use . The α v β 3 and α II β 3 integrins dominate MD simulations due to a number of their solved 3D structures . However , with an increasing number of X - ray or NMR 3D structures and reliable homology models , it is reasonable to assume that the remaining integrins will also be studied using molecular modeling methods . 5 . Integrins as Therapeutic Targets Integrins in Diseases Integrins , as transmembrane glycoproteins located on the surfaces of the cells , rec - ognize many physiological ligands [ 229 ] . They bind through their ectodomains with numerous ligands and , thus , are involved in cell – cell and cell – ECM interactions inﬂuencing cell migration and ECM assembly and remodeling . Among the most relevant ligands belong ICAM - 1 ( Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 ; also known as CD54 ) , VCAM - 1 ( Vascu - lar Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 ; CD106 ) , MAdCAM - 1 ( Mucosal Addressin Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 ) , E - cadherin , PECAM - 1 ( Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 ; CD31 ) , EPCR ( Endothelial Cell Protein C Receptor ) , thrombomodulin , ﬁbronectin , collagen , and irisin [ 230 ] . The cytoplasmic domain of integrins also interacts with many cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules . These interactions mediate fundamental cell processes associated with diverse physiological and pathological pathways . Though integrin – ligand interactions play a pivotal role in maintaining the health conditions of various tissues , their aberrant activation is detrimental in multiple diseases , including development , immunity , hemostasis and thrombosis , inﬂammation , angiogenesis , tumor growth and metastasis , multiple sclerosis , inﬂammatory bowel disease , nephritis , osteoporosis , sickle cell disease , and ﬁbrosis [ 9 , 13 , 24 , 231 , 232 ] . Many papers exist regarding the role of aberrant integrin adhesion and signaling in the pathogenesis of many human diseases . It is beyond this paper’s scope to discuss this complex area of research in detail . Therefore , the following sections only brieﬂy discuss the importance of integrins in various diseases , and readers may ﬁnd more detailed insight in available reviews . Inﬂammation . Activated integrins are involved in leukocyte extravasation from blood to inﬂamed tissues . This process consists of multiple sequential molecular interactions called Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 19 of 44 leukocyte adhesion cascade [ 150 , 233 ] . Circulating leukocytes interact during tethering and rolling with selectins on the activated endothelium . These contacts are identiﬁed by chemokines , which trigger inside - out activation ( by binding effectors to the cytoplasmic tail of the β subunit ) of leukocyte integrins ( e . g . , α L β 2 , α M β 2 , α 4 β 1 , and α 4 β 7 ) that then bind to their counter - receptors on the endothelium , including ICAMs and VCAMs . Binding these adhesion ligands stabilizes the high - afﬁnity integrin conformation and strengthens the binding of leukocytes to the endothelium . Firmly bound leukocytes crawl along the endothelium and ﬁnally migrate through the endothelium to inﬂamed sites [ 183 ] ( Figure 9 ) . Cells 2022 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 20 of 47 this paper ' s scope to discuss this complex area of research in detail . Therefore , the follow - ing sections only briefly discuss the importance of integrins in various diseases , and read - ers may find more detailed insight in available reviews . Inflammation . Activated integrins are involved in leukocyte extravasation from blood to inflamed tissues . This process consists of multiple sequential molecular interactions called leukocyte adhesion cascade [ 150 , 233 ] . Circulating leukocytes interact during teth - ering and rolling with selectins on the activated endothelium . These contacts are identi - fied by chemokines , which trigger inside - out activation ( by binding effectors to the cyto - plasmic tail of the β subunit ) of leukocyte integrins ( e . g . , α L β 2 , α M β 2 , α 4 β 1 , and α 4 β 7 ) that then bind to their counter - receptors on the endothelium , including ICAMs and VCAMs . Binding these adhesion ligands stabilizes the high - affinity integrin conformation and strengthens the binding of leukocytes to the endothelium . Firmly bound leukocytes crawl along the endothelium and finally migrate through the endothelium to inflamed sites [ 183 ] ( Figure 9 ) . Figure 9 . Leukocyte adhesion cascade : the multi - step recruitment process from blood to target tis - sues in the inflammatory source . Reprinted with permission from ref . [ 234 ] . Integrins are crucial components of the leukocyte adhesion cascade responsible for proper leukocyte homing in inflammatory responses . Their role is documented by pa - tients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency ( LAD ) syndromes who suffer from recurrent infections and bleeding disorders . It was discovered that a mutation in β 2 integrins is re - sponsible for LAD affecting the interaction with kindlins - 3 , and as a result , leukocytes cannot get to the inflammation site [ 235 ] . A complete failure of platelet aggregation to form a clot caused by mutations of the α IIb β 3 integrin is characteristic of Glanzmann ' s thrombasthenia [ 236 ] . Abnormal bleeding that can be life - threatening is a typical symp - tom of patients suffering from Glanzmann ' s thrombasthenia . Another genetic disease is Epidermolysis bullosa , a connective tissue disorder that causes your skin to blister and tear easily , caused by a mutation of the α 6 β 4 integrin [ 237 ] . Symptoms are often severe with life - threatening complications . Integrins are crucial in preventing chronic inflamma - tion by removing apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages in acute inflammation , an ef - ferocytosis process [ 238 ] . Inflammatory bowel diseases . Leukocyte integrins play a prominent role in inflamma - tory bowel diseases ( IBDs ) , including Crohn’s disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Uncontrolled inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract is typical for IBDs [ 239 , 240 ] . The migration of activated T - lymphocytes to the intestinal vasculature is mediated by interac - tions of α 4 β 1 , α 4 β 7 , and α E β 7 integrins with their ligands VCAM - 1 , MAdCAM - 1 , and E - cadherin . In the inflamed gut of IBDs patients , an increased number of VCAM - 1 and MAdCAM - 1 ligands were observed that contributed to the increase of pro - inflammatory lymphocytes , which are retained through enhanced interactions between the α E β 7 integ - rin and E - cadherin . Thus , aberrant interactions of α 4 β 1 , α 4 β 7 , and α E β 7 integrins with Figure 9 . Leukocyte adhesion cascade : the multi - step recruitment process from blood to target tissues in the inﬂammatory source . Reprinted with permission from ref . [ 234 ] .

Symptoms are often severe with life - threatening complications . Integrins are crucial in preventing chronic inﬂammation by removing apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages in acute inﬂammation , an efferocytosis process [ 238 ] . Inﬂammatory bowel diseases . Leukocyte integrins play a prominent role in inﬂammatory bowel diseases ( IBDs ) , including Crohn’s disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Uncon - trolled inﬂammation of the gastrointestinal tract is typical for IBDs [ 239 , 240 ] . The migration of activated T - lymphocytes to the intestinal vasculature is mediated by interactions of α 4 β 1 , α 4 β 7 , and α E β 7 integrins with their ligands VCAM - 1 , MAdCAM - 1 , and E - cadherin . In the inﬂamed gut of IBDs patients , an increased number of VCAM - 1 and MAdCAM - 1 ligands were observed that contributed to the increase of pro - inﬂammatory lymphocytes , which are retained through enhanced interactions between the α E β 7 integrin and E - cadherin . Thus , aberrant interactions of α 4 β 1 , α 4 β 7 , and α E β 7 integrins with their ligands VCAM - 1 , MAdCAM - 1 , and E - cadherin play critical roles in the pathogenesis of BDIs [ 239 ] . Therefore , the therapy based on inhibiting these interactions may be beneﬁcial for treating patients suffering from BDIs . Arthritis . Inﬂammation of the synovium tissue is characteristic of chronic inﬂammatory arthritides . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is the best - studied disease in this group [ 241 – 243 ] . In RA , enhanced pro - inﬂammatory cell levels cause overexpression integrin receptors and their ligands [ 244 ] . The analysis of integrin distribution in synovial tissue of RA Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 20 of 44 revealed [ 243 ] an increased expression of collagen - , laminin - , and ﬁbronectin - binding inte - grins , especially those containing α 5 , α v , and β 1 subunits . Additionally , an upregulation of the α L β 2 ( LFA - 1 ) integrin that enhances the migration of immune cells into the synovial tissue was observed [ 243 ] . Enhanced levels of these integrins causes the overproduction of matrix - degrading enzymes and ﬁbroblasts that degrade cartilage , and thus preserve RA . All these ﬁndings suggest integrins’ crucial role in RA disease that can be restrained with integrin inhibitors . Fibrosis . Five integrins containing the α v subunit ( α v β 1 , α v β 3 , α v β 5 , α v β 6 , and α v β 8 ) have been identiﬁed to play a relevant role in ﬁbrotic diseases [ 245 ] in several organs , including the heart , blood vessels , lung , kidney , liver , and skin [ 246 ] . Typical for ﬁbrosis is ECM stiffening with loss of elasticity and excessive tissue deposition with a debilitating condition [ 247 ] . Under chronic injury or inﬂammation , integrins activate pro - ﬁbrotic transforming growth factor β ( TGF β ) . Induced ﬁbroblasts upregulate ECM production , leading to ﬁbrosis progression . It was found that α v integrins are upregulated in ﬁbrotic diseases , and studies using knockout mice demonstrated that deletion of α v integrins might attenuate ﬁbrosis progression [ 248 ] . Atherosclerosis . Integrin signaling plays a crucial role in atherosclerosis , a chronic inﬂammatory disease affecting large arteries [ 249 , 250 ] . The binding of the α IIb β 3 integrin with ﬁbrinogen is involved in platelet aggregation , and β 2 integrins ( α M4 β 2 and α L β 2 ) control macrophage binding . An overexpression of integrins and their ligands was ob - served in atherosclerosis [ 249 ] . For example , an upregulation of the α 4 β 7 integrin and its ligands VCAM - 1 and MAdCAM - 1 was found in atherosclerosis , and the atherosclerotic plaque area was signiﬁcantly reduced in the α 4 β 7 deﬁcient mice [ 251 , 252 ] . In addition , attenuated atherosclerosis was observed upon deletion of other integrins , such as the leuko - cyte α X β 2 [ 253 ] , α v β 3 [ 254 ] , and α 5 β 1 [ 255 ] . Therefore , the inhibition of these integrins has the potential to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis . Eye diseases . Integrins play an essential role in normal development and the devel - opment of pathological processes in the eye [ 26 ] . For example , the α v β 6 integrin is a key player in corneal ﬁbrosis [ 256 ] ; integrins α 1 , α 3 , α 4 , α L , β 1 , β 3 , and β 4 were upregulated in the heredity eye disease Fuchs’ corneal dystrophy [ 257 ] . The α L integrin plays a vital role in dry eye diseases , and its inhibition signiﬁcantly improves ailments [ 258 ] . In glaucoma , the α v β 3 integrin was upregulated in retinal ganglion cells and the glial cells of the nerve head after nerve crush in mice [ 259 ] . The examples mentioned above documented some eye diseases associated with the deregulation of integrins . Cancer . A multistep process of cancer development includes tumor initiation and sustainable chronic proliferation , local invasion and intravasation into blood , surviving circulation , adhesion to the endothelium , extravasation , initial seeding , and proliferation in the target tissue [ 260 – 263 ] . Many studies have indicated that integrins mediate various aspects of these steps [ 23 , 264 – 269 ] , and below , we present only a few selected examples . Biochemical and genetic studies have documented aberrant integrin activity in cancer cells associated with an altered expression of integrins , which is dependent on the cancer type and the stage of the disease [ 23 ] . A high abundance of various β 1 , β 4 , and α v integrins ( α 3 β 1 , α 4 β 1 , α 5 β 1 , α 6 β 4 , α v β 3 , α v β 5 , α v β 6 , and α v β 8 ) is associated with metastasis and frequently correlates with poor prognoses [ 23 , 267 ] . However , the role of integrins is not straightforward . For example , although β 1 integrins play a crucial role in cancer development and the α 3 β 1 integrin is vital for mammary cancer [ 270 ] , the α 2 β 1 integrin is a metastatic suppressor in breast cancer [ 271 ] . Genetic studies have revealed that the β 4 integrin is necessary for tumor initiation and progression in mammary and skin tumorigenesis [ 265 ] . Additionally , it was found [ 269 ] that an overexpression of the α v β 3 integrin plays a vital role in developing tumor - initiating cells in lung and pancreatic cancers . These cells are assumed to contribute to cancer relapse after the initial response to treatment . Furthermore , the α v β 3 integrin was found to mediate the resistance of tumor - initiating cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors through the activation of NF - κ B in a ligand - independent manner [ 272 ] . Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 21 of 44 Cancer metastasis is a complex multi - step process , and from a vast number of primary tumors , only a tiny number of metastases develop . To form metastasis in nearby or distant organs , cancer cells have to accomplish all of several consecutive steps : detachment from the primary tumor , intravasation to the blood vessel , survival of circulation in blood and adhesion to the endothelium , extravasation from the blood into the target organ , and proliferation in the organ microenvironment [ 260 , 263 ] . Accumulating experimental evidence showed that during the circulation in the blood , cancer cells utilize a similar mechanism used by leukocytes in the inﬂammatory cascade [ 273 , 274 ] . Various adhesion molecules mediate the transendothelial migration of cancer cells , including activated integrins of cancer cells , such as α 4 β 1 binding to endothelium ligand VCAM - 1 and α L β 1 binding to LCAM - 1 . However , the role of integrins is more complex , and some data suggest that laminin - binding integrins α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 4 might have an inhibitory effect on cancer metastasis [ 275 ] . The dual role of the α 3 β 1 integrin was shown in breast cancer . The absence of integrin α 3 β 1 reduced the survival of mice , and increased tumor growth was observed [ 276 ] . Similarly , the α 3 subunit of the α 3 β 1 integrin interacts with various ECM ligands , and its function depends on the cancer type . In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , the expression of α 3 negatively correlated with tumor growth and metastasis [ 277 ] . An opposite functioning of α 9 was observed in breast cancer , where knocking out α 9 signiﬁcantly reduced tumor growth , angiogenesis , and metastasis [ 278 ] . Integrins are also involved in ECM remodeling to induce cancer cell invasion , with cancer - associated ﬁbroblasts ( CAFs ) playing a vital role . It was found [ 279 ] that the α v β 3 integrin expressed by CAFs participates in CAFs’ assembling of ﬁbronectin and metastasis . In addition , other integrins , such as the α 5 β 1 integrin [ 280 ] , α v β 6 integrin [ 281 , 282 ] , and α 9 β 1 integrin , promote the recruitment of CAFs . Angiogenesis supplies nutrition for tumor survival and supports tumor cell transfer into blood vessels for circulation . Three endothelial integrins , namely α v β 3 , α v β 5 , and α 5 β 1 mediate tumor angiogenesis [ 283 ] . It has been shown that tumors use integrin - ECM interactions as one of the strategies to escape anti - tumor therapies [ 284 ] . To achieve this goal , tumors overexpress integrins , such as β 1 , and activate signaling pathways that block the effect of drugs [ 285 , 286 ] . Integrins as a route to invasion by viruses and bacteria . Various pathogens can exploit integrins as receptors to attach and enter the host cells ; for review , see references [ 287 – 290 ] . Over time , viruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to colonize host cells . The binding to the host is the ﬁrst step of virus entry ( internalization ) , and among different receptors , viruses utilize integrins . Several viruses display on the viral surface proteins containing amino acid moiety RGD , which they use for binding with RGD - binding integrins [ 289 ] ( α v β 1 , α v β 3 , α v β 5 , α v β 6 , α v β 8 , α 8 β 1 , and α IIb β 3 ) . Among those , many adenoviruses interact with α v integrins as documented by the solved structure of the complex with the α v β 5 integrin by cryoelectron microscopy [ 291 ] . The binding starts virus internalization , and it was shown that inhibition of binding resulted in a significant decrease in viral infection [ 292 ] . Interestingly , adenovirus bind - ing also induces the clustering of integrins that enhance infection . Similarly , several members of the Herpesviridae family , such as Kaposi’s sarcoma - associated herpes virus or human herpes virus 8 , utilize the α v β 3 integrin [ 293 ] . The integrins α IIb β 3 and α v β 3 function as receptors for pathogenic strains of hantaviruses , while non - pathogenic strains of the Prospect Hill virus utilize the β 1 integrin [ 294 , 295 ] . Coxsackievirus , a member of the enterovirus family , uses the α v β 6 integrin for cell entry [ 296 ] . Interactions of retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV - 1 ) with the α 4 β 7 , α v β 5 , α v β 3 , and α 5 β 1 integrins are critical for cell entry [ 297 – 299 ] . Among other RGD - binding viruses , deadly Ebola virus interactions with the α 5 β 1 integrin are essential for fibroblast infection [ 300 ] . Other viruses using RGD moiety for engagements with host cells include Zika virus [ 301 ] ( α v β 5 ) , rotavirus [ 302 ] ( α v β 3 ) , and foot - and - mouth disease [ 303 ] ( α v β 6 ) . Recently , it was suggested that SARS - CoV - 2 might also use RGD - binding integrins as cell receptors through interactions with spike protein [ 304 , 305 ] . Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 22 of 44 Not all viruses recognize RGD moiety for their interactions with integrins . An al - phavirus Ross River virus associated with polyarthritis utilizes the binding of integrins α 1 β 1 and α 2 β 1 for cell entry and infection [ 306 ] . The role of the α 2 β 1 integrin is sup - ported by blocking infection with function - antibodies against α 2 β 1 [ 306 ] . Rotavirus spike protein uses different spike amino acids moieties to enter a cell : the YFL domain binds with the α 4 β 1 and α 4 β 7 integrins [ 307 ] , and the GPR moiety interacts with the α X β 2 inte - grin [ 308 , 309 ] . Human echovirus , which is associated with meningoencephalitis , utilizes for successfully infecting cell clusters of the α 2 β 1 integrin [ 310 ] . Interestingly , HIV - 1 , in addition to binding RGD - binding integrins , also uses interactions with the α 4 β 7 integrin for efﬁcient cell - to - cell spreading [ 298 ] . Integrin receptors are also vital for many bacterial infections , and in the following , only some examples will be presented . More details can be found in reviews [ 288 , 290 ] . Some bacteria use an adhesion , a protein expressed on their surface , to interact with integrins on host cells to initiate cell entry . For example , Yersinia bacteria cause pain and tenderness in the abdomen , nausea , and diarrhea , and use the protein invasin to interact with ﬁve β 1 integrins , namely α 3 β 1 , α 4 β 1 , α 5 β 1 , α 6 β 1 , and α v β 1 , for efﬁcient host cell entry [ 311 ] . Helicobacter pylori is linked to various stomach diseases , and the host clustered β 1 integrins attach bacteria through a type 4 secretion system to the cell membrane [ 312 ] . Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria is a source of Lyme disease , and a membrane protein P66 binding to β 3 integrins has been identiﬁed as the mechanism of bacteria adhesion [ 313 ] . Some bacteria express proteins that bind to the protein ﬁbronectin from ECM and through ﬁbronectin to host cell integrins in the so - called sandwich model [ 314 ] . For example , Staphylococcus bacteria cause mucosal or septicemic infection and express two ﬁbronectin - binding proteins , FnbpA and B . These proteins interact with the α 5 β 1 integrin and can be inhibited by RGD peptides [ 315 ] . Streptococcus bacteria use a similar mechanism responsible for acute pharyngitis in humans [ 316 ] and by Porhyronomas bacteria that causes periodontitis [ 317 ] . A common bacterium , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , causes acute or chronic lung infections and employs interactions with α 5 β 1 and α v β 5 integrins and their ligands ﬁbronectin and vitronectin to invade host cells [ 318 ] . Neisseria bacteria cause sexually transmitted gonorrhea disease ( N . gonorrhoeae ) and meningitis ( N . meningitidis ) . Infections by Neisseria commence with an attachment to host cell surfaces . Then , the host cell receptors trigger signaling , activating the α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 integrins with the following cell entry [ 319 ] . The above - discussed example illustrates the crucial importance of integrins’ recognition in viral and bacterial infections . In many cases , they mediate attachment , internalization , and tissue . Thus , they represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention . 6 . Integrin - Based Therapeutics The above examples illustrate integrins’ association with various physiological and pathologic processes and diseases . Therefore , it is unsurprising that integrin - related dis - eases are an attractive target for drug development [ 14 , 24 , 27 , 231 , 320 – 322 ] . Different thera - peutics have been designed to intervene in integrin functions by restraining or stimulating cell penetration into the tissues , including antibodies , small non - peptide molecules , and peptides [ 24 ] . Not all academic and industrial research efforts to develop integrin - based therapeutics have been successful . In the last 30 years , there have been many agents in clinical trials , but only seven approved integrin - based drugs [ 24 ] . 6 . 1 . Marketed Drugs The ﬁrst drug developed and approved in 1994 was the antibody abciximab ( ReoPro ) , a platelet aggregation inhibitor that is a pan - β 3 antagonist used to inhibit the binding of the α IIb β 3 integrin to ﬁbronectin . This interaction prevents platelet aggregation , causing blood clots within the coronary artery and targeting acute coronary syndrome and thrombotic car - diovascular syndrome . Another three drugs , efalizumab , natalizumab , and vedolizumab , are also antibodies . Efalizumab ( Raptiva ) is a humanized monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) designed to treat the autoimmune disease psoriasis . Efalizumab blocks extravasation of the Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 23 of 44 lymphocyte by inhibiting the α L β 2 integrin . Efalizumab was associated with fatal brain infections and was withdrawn from the market in 2009 [ 323 ] . Natalizumab ( Tysabri ) is a humanized mAb used to treat multiple sclerosis ( MS ) and Crohn’s disease . Natalizumab reduces the homing of T cells to the gut by inhibiting ligand binding to α 4 β 7 and α 4 β 1 integrins . Natalizumab is clinically effective but is associated with severe adverse effects , including fatal neurological disease and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy . In - terestingly , natalizumab was withdrawn four months after its approval in 2005 , but in 2006 returned to the market for MS . Vedolizumab ( Entyvio ) is a humanized mAb targeting the α 4 β 7 integrin . It treats inﬂammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease .

Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 24 of 44 Eptiﬁbatide ( Integrilin ) , tiroﬁban ( Aggrastat ) , and liﬁtegrast ( Xiidra ) are three small molecule integrin antagonists that entered the market ( Figure 11 ) . Eptiﬁbatide is a hep - tapeptide RGD mimetic and binds to platelets through the α IIb β 3 integrin ; it was approved in 1998 . Similarly to abciximab , eptiﬁbatide prevents causing thrombus in a coronary artery . It is used to reduce the risk of acute cardiac ischemic events . The second small molecule drug , tiroﬁban , employs the same mechanism and has the same indication as abciximab and eptiﬁbatide . It was approved in 1998 . The third small molecule drug , liﬁtegrast , was approved in 2016 and is an inhibitor of the α L β 2 integrin . Liﬁtegrast blocks the binding of T lymphocyte’s integrin α L β 2 to its ligand ICAM - 1 and thus decreases inﬂammation . It is used for dry eye treatment , including meibomian gland dysfunction and inﬂammatory dry eye . Unfortunately , none of these agents are administrated orally .

Schematic representation of the three small molecule marketed drugs : ( a ) eptiﬁbatide , ( b ) tiroﬁban , ( c ) liﬁtegrast , and ( d ) zalunﬁban ( RUC - 4 ) , compound in the Phase 3 clinical trial . 6 . 2 . RGD - Binding Integrins A considerable effort is focused on drug development targeting eight ( α IIb β 3 , α 5 β 1 , α 8 β 1 , α v β 1 , α v β 3 , α v β 5 , α v β 6 , and α v β 8 ) RGD - binding integrins . Platelet - expressed integrin α IIb β 3 attracted a long - lasting interest for its role in cardiovascular and autoim - mune diseases . Integrin α IIb β 3 also plays a role in cancer progression . Efforts in α IIb β 3 antagonist development led to the three already - mentioned drugs , abciximab , eptiﬁbatide , and tiroﬁban , which have antithrombotic effects by blocking platelet aggregation . Other therapeutic agents against the α IIb β 3 integrin are under development , and more details can be found in selected reviews [ 24 , 152 , 231 , 325 ] . However , several oral α IIb β 3 antagonists failed in clinical trials , and , surprisingly , mortality was higher in treated patients than in placebo control [ 326 ] . The α IIb β 3 integrin is characteristic of an inactive conformation with low afﬁnity for ligands in the resting platelet . The inside - out activation by binding talin and kindlin triggers a conformational change of integrins to a high afﬁnity for lig - ands . The crystal structures of the α IIb β 3 integrin in complex with its inhibitors revealed that small inhibitors that failed in clinical trials stabilize high - afﬁnity ( open - extended ) conformation [ 327 ] . The authors also found that water located in the MIDAS region sta - bilizes integrins in their low - afﬁnity ( bent ) conformation , and drugs that stabilize this water also stabilize bent conformation . Recently , a small molecule Zalunﬁban ( RUC - 4 ) Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 25 of 44 ( Figure 11d ) integrin α IIb β 3 inhibitor that does not activate integrin has shown encourag - ing results [ 328 ] . Zalunﬁban is now in Phase 3 clinical trial ( CELEBRATE , ClinicalTrials . gov Identiﬁer : NCT04825743 , sponsored by CeleCor Therapeutics ) . Drug discovery focused on the α v subfamily of RGD - binding integrins due to their association with cancer [ 268 , 325 ] , arthritis [ 243 ] , osteoporosis [ 329 ] , age macular degenera - tion [ 26 ] , and ﬁbrotic diseases [ 246 ] . However , no drug was regulatory approved . Among ﬁve α v integrins , the α v β 3 integrin was the main focus for drug development for its im - plication in angiogenesis and tumor growth [ 322 ] . Recently , beyond α v β 3 , α v β 1 , α v β 5 , and α v β 6 were also targeted . The most progressed α v β 3 inhibitor was cilengitide , a cyclic peptide developed by Merck . However , it failed in Phase III [ 330 ] . The development of many small molecules targeting α v inhibitors is in progress , and it is beyond the scope of this review to discuss all of them ; details can be found in some reviews [ 14 , 25 , 321 , 322 , 331 ] . 6 . 3 . Leukocyte Integrins Eight leukocyte integrins , α L β 2 , α M β 2 , α X β 2 , α D β 2 , α E β 7 , α 4 β 7 , α 9 β 1 , and α 4 β 1 play a vital role in inﬂammation and immunity . They are irreplaceable in leukocyte extrava - sation from blood to inﬂamed tissue [ 150 , 233 ] . Their inhibitors are potential therapeutics for modulating inﬂammation and are proven applicable in several diseases , such as IBD , psoriasis , dry eye diseases , asthma , multiple sclerosis , and cancer [ 24 , 231 ] . Three integrins , α L β 2 , α E β 7 , and α 4 β 7 , play an essential role in lymphocytes homing into the gut . Two mAb , natalizumab and vedolizumab ( Figure 10 ) , were successfully developed for treating UC and DC [ 239 ] and are already on the market . A human mAb AMG 181 was designed for IBD treatment by Amgen against the α 4 β 7 integrin , now in Phase II trials . A small molecule inhibitor of the α L β 2 integrin is marketed to treat dry eye disease [ 26 ] . Another human mAb , etrolizumab , targets α E β 7 and α 4 β 7 integrins by blocking interactions with their ligands E - cadherin and MAdCAM - 1 , respectively , and is now in Phase 3 clinical trial ( BERGAMOT , ClinicalTrials . gov Identiﬁer : NCT02394028 , sponsored by Hoffmann - La Roche ) . Natalizumab is also used to treat chronic neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system ( CNS ) . However , in rare cases of treatment with natalizumab , a fatal multi - focal encelophalopathy occurred . Various small molecules have been designed to tackle leukocyte integrins ; details can be found in some reviews [ 25 , 27 , 231 , 239 ] . 6 . 4 . Integrin - Based Biomaterials for Bone and Tissue Repair Recently , a new application of integrins emerged , namely in biomaterials applied in bone repair debilitated by non - healing skeletal defects caused by osteoarthritis , traumatic injury , and cancer [ 29 – 31 , 332 – 334 ] . Requirements for an orthopedic biomaterial stimulating implant integration in bone repair include the adhesion to osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells and support of their biological function . Interactions between bone cells ( osteoblast and osteoprogenitor ) and ECM regulate these processes . A group of integrins highly expressed in osteoblast and osteoprogenitor cells includes α 1 β 1 , α 2 β 1 , α 3 β 1 , α 4 β 1 , α 5 β 1 , α 6 β 1 , α 8 β 1 , α 9 β 1 , α 4 β 7 , α v β 3 , and α v β 5 [ 30 ] . Therefore , much effort was focused on developing biomaterial functionalized by integrin ligands [ 332 , 334 ] and with good safety proﬁles [ 335 ] . Various strategies for synthesizing biomaterial functionalized with multivalent ECM - ligand were developed [ 29 , 31 , 332 , 333 ] . Though these technologies are in their infancy , some encouraging results have been obtained , such as biomaterial prepared from clinical - grade titanium and functionalized with various fractions of α 5 β 1 binding ﬁbronectin III being im - planted into tibia defects in a rat model [ 336 ] . The results showed that targeting of the α 5 β 1 integrin led to increased bone formation and bone repair in mice . Additionally , biomaterial with α 4 β 1 ligands promotes bone formation and bone mass increase in mice . Interactions between bone cells and biomaterials are predominantly controlled by cell adhesion , which results from binding integrins to mimetics of their ECM ligands attached to biomaterial surface . The results suggest that applications of integrins’ functions to biomaterial have a potential not only in regenerative medicine but also in providing opportunity in device Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 26 of 44 design and tissue remodeling . However , understanding several factors affecting the prop - erties of biomaterials with a tuned integrin speciﬁcity and optimized ligand clustering remain to be resolved . 6 . 5 . Molecular Modeling in the Design and Development of Integrin Antagonists Plethora molecules were synthesized as potential integrin antagonists [ 25 , 321 , 331 , 337 – 339 ] . In the beginning , their structures were mainly designed using chemical intuition to mimic integrin - binding moieties , such as RGD [ 340 ] or LDVP [ 229 , 341 ] ( Figure 12a , b ) . Despite signiﬁcant effort and many compounds entering clinical trials , only three small molecule inhibitors entered the market [ 14 , 24 , 231 , 320 ] . An integrin antagonist is a molecule that binds to the integrin natural ligand binding site ( competitive antagonist ) or another site ( non - competitive antagonist ) and thus blocks the integrin function . This term is analogous to competitive and non - competitive inhibition of enzymes . An agonist is a molecule that functions oppositely and initiates integrin function by binding to the receptor . Therefore , molecular modeling methods are suitable tools for rational developing antagonists . Recent progress in solving 3D structures of various integrins , either by X - ray crystallography , NMR , or homology modeling , provided the opportunity to use molecular modeling meth - ods within rational drug discovery processes . Molecular docking , structure - based virtual screening , and molecular dynamics simulations are the most employed methods for this purpose . In light of several published reviews describing small molecule antagonists of in - tegrins , our aim is not to review all available studies on the subject . Instead , we will discuss the impact of the structure - based drug design using selected results . Examples were chosen to include the antagonist discovery in relevant integrins , such as RGD - binding integrins and leukocyte integrins , and where molecular modeling methods played a prominent role . Cells 2022 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 28 of 48 highly expressed in osteoblast and osteoprogenitor cells includes  1  1 ,  2  1 ,  3  1 ,  4  1 ,  5  1 ,  6  1 ,  8  1 ,  9  1 ,  4  7 ,  v  3 , and  v  5 [ 30 ] . Therefore , much effort was focused on developing biomaterial functionalized by integrin ligands [ 332 , 334 ] and with good safety profiles [ 335 ] . Various strategies for synthesizing biomaterial functionalized with multivalent ECM - ligand were developed [ 29 , 31 , 332 , 333 ] . Though these technologies are in their in - fancy , some encouraging results have been obtained , such as biomaterial prepared from clinical - grade titanium and functionalized with various fractions of  5  1 binding fibron - ectin III being implanted into tibia defects in a rat model [ 336 ] . The results showed that targeting of the α5β1 integrin led to increased bone form ation and bone repair in mice . Additionally , biomaterial with α4β1 ligands promotes bone formation and bone mass in - crease in mice . Interactions between bone cells and biomaterials are predominantly con - trolled by cell adhesion , which results from binding integrins to mimetics of their ECM ligands attached to biomaterial surface . The results suggest that applications of integrins ’ functions to biomaterial have a potential not only in regenerative medicine but also in providing opportunity in device design and tissue remodeling . However , understanding several factors affecting the properties of biomaterials with a tuned integrin specificity and optimized ligand clustering remain to be resolved . Figure 12 .

Molecular Modeling in the Design and Development of Integrin Antagonists . Plethora molecules were synthesized as potential integrin antagonists [ 25 , 321 , 331 , 337 – 339 ] . In the beginning , their structures were mainly designed using chem - ical intuition to mimic integrin - binding moieties , such as RGD [ 340 ] or LDVP [ 229 , 341 ] ( Figure 12a , b ) . Despite significant effort and many compounds entering clinical trials , only three small molecule inhibitors entered the market [ 14 , 24 , 231 , 320 ] . An integrin an - tagonist is a molecule that binds to the integrin natural ligand binding site ( competitive antagonist ) or another site ( non - competitive antagonist ) and thus blocks the integrin func - tion . This term is analogous to competitive and non - competitive inhibition of enzymes . Figure 12 . Schematic representation of ( a ) Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) , ( b ) Leu - Asp - Val - Pro ( LDVP ) integrin - binding motifs , ( c ) cyclic peptide RGD inhibitor cilengitide , and ( d ) key structural features of RGD - binding site . After identifying minimal integrin - binding motives , much effort was dedicated to developing their mimetics as potential integrin antagonists . Diverse strategies using various peptidic and non - peptidic scaffolds for preparing peptidomimetics were utilized . Cyclic peptidomimetics were often used as scaffolds to ensure a proper conformation of the binding moiety . For an effective rational drug design , the knowledge of the receptor Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 27 of 44 3D structure is essential . The solved X - ray structure of the α v β 3 complex with the cyclic antagonist cilengitide ( Figure 12c , IC 50 = 0 . 65 nM ) provided information about the spatial arrangement of the RGD - binding motif [ 173 ] . Small molecule RGD antagonists bind to a binding pocket in a groove between the β - propeller of the α subunit and the β I domain of the β subunit atop the RGD - binding integrins such as α v , α 5 β 1 , α 8 β 1 , and α IIb β 3 . The solved 3D structures of integrin - RGD ligand complexes revealed critical interactions in the binding site shown in Figure 12d [ 20 , 175 , 203 , 342 ] . Ligand binding to the β - subunit is stabilized using electrostatic interactions between a carboxylate group and the MIDAS bivalent metal ion . The guanidino group interacts with several negatively charged residues from the α - subunit . A typical distance between the carboxylate and guanidine groups is in the range of 13 . 5 – 15 . 5 Å and 7 . 5 – 8 . 5 Å between the β carbons of arginine and aspartate [ 338 ] . The molecular modeling methods were also used to interpret different behavior of compounds c [ ( R ) - β - Phe - ψ ( NHCO ) Asp - ψ ( NHCO ) Gly - Arg ] and c [ ( S ) - β - Phe - ψ - ( NHCO ) Asp - ψ ( NHCO ) Gly - Arg ] ( Figure 13a , b ) . These two compounds displayed different activities , though they have identical amino acid structures and differ only in the stereochemistry of the aromatic side chain . The S stereoisomer ( Figure 13a ) showed a submicromolar activity for α 5 β 1 ( IC 50 = 0 . 52 µ M ) and two orders lower for α v β 3 ( IC 50 = 11 µ M ) , while the R stereoisomer ( Figure 13b ) exhibited a potent dual antagonist activity , IC 50 = 0 . 18 µ M and IC 50 = 0 . 024 µ M for α v β 3 and α 5 β 1 , respectively . Solution conformations of both com - pounds determined by NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations were used as the starting structures for the following molecular docking into the α v β 3 integrin using Glide [ 343 ] . Molecular docking revealed that unfavorable interactions of the pseudoaxial orientation of the benzyl substituent in the S stereoisomer hinder a proper accommodation in the receptor site . In contrast , the pseudoequatorial orientation in the R - stereoisomer does not exhibit any steric hindrance . Cells 2022 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 29 of 48 An agonist is a molecule that functions oppositely and initiates integrin function by bind - ing to the receptor . Therefore , molecular modeling methods are suitable tools for rational developing antagonists . Recent progress in solving 3D structures of various integrins , ei - ther by X - ray crystallography , NMR , or homology modeling , provided the opportunity to use molecular modeling methods within rational drug discovery processes . Molecular docking , structure - based virtual screening , and molecular dynamics simulations are the most employed methods for this purpose . In light of several published reviews describing small molecule antagonists of integrins , our aim is not to review all available studies on the subject . Instead , we will discuss the impact of the structure - based drug design using selected results . Examples were chosen to include the antagonist discovery in relevant integrins , such as RGD - binding integrins and leukocyte integrins , and where molecular modeling methods played a prominent role . After identifying minimal integrin - binding motives , much effort was dedicated to developing their mimetics as potential integrin antagonists . Diverse strategies using var - ious peptidic and non - peptidic scaffolds for preparing peptidomimetics were utilized . Cy - clic peptidomimetics were often used as scaffolds to ensure a proper conformation of the binding moiety . For an effective rational drug design , the knowledge of the receptor 3D structure is essential . The solved X - ray structure of the  v  3 complex with the cyclic an - tagonist cilengitide ( Figure 12c , IC 50 = 0 . 65 nM ) provided information about the spatial arrangement of the RGD - binding motif [ 175 ] . Small molecule RGD antagonists bind to a binding pocket in a groove between the  - propeller of the  subunit and the βI domain of the  subunit atop the RGD - binding in - tegrins such as  v ,  5  1 ,  8  1 , and  IIb  3 . The solved 3D structures of integrin - RGD lig - and complexes revealed critical interactions in the binding site shown in Figure 12d [ 20 , 175 , 203 , 342 ] . Ligand binding to the  - subunit is stabilized using electrostatic interac - tions between a carboxylate group and the MIDAS bivalent metal ion . The guanidino group interacts with several negatively charged residues from the  - subunit . A typical distance between the carboxylate and guanidine groups is in the range of 13 . 5 – 15 . 5 Å and 7 . 5 – 8 . 5 Å between the  carbons of arginine and aspartate [ 338 ] . Figure 13 .

Much attention has been paid to developing drugs for various diseases focusing on α v integrins , especially on α v β 3 integrin - involved cancer [ 264 ] and osteoporosis [ 329 ] . Molec - ular modeling methods were often included in the discovery process [ 131 , 196 , 346 – 354 ] . Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 28 of 44 The α v β 3 crystal structure was used to analyze the binding mode of several potential inhibitors utilizing the docking approach [ 349 ] . The starting conformation of seven ( four cyclic and three acyclic compounds ) selected antagonists were based on solution confor - mations determined by NMR and MD simulations . Docking was performed using the AutoDock program with the backbone conformation held ﬁxed while side chains were allowed to rotate . The obtained binding poses and scores compare well with experimental activity data . The results suggest that the orientation and distance between the positively - charged Arg and the negatively - charged carboxyl group of Asp groups inﬂuence the ligand binding . In addition , a pharmacophore model has been proposed for the rational design of α v β 3 ligands as potential anti - cancer drugs . The binding properties of several cyclic RGD antagonists were investigated by combining surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) experiments and molecular docking using the LigandFit procedure [ 351 ] . SPR measurements identiﬁed cyclo [ - Arg - Gly - Asp - ψ ( triazole ) - Gly - Lys ] as the most active with K D = 1 . 2 nM . Docking results showed that the binding of this cyclopeptide is consistent with the binding pose of cilengitide in α v β 3 . Cyclic peptides are relatively ﬂexible molecules , and their conformations signiﬁ - cantly inﬂuence pharmacological activity against integrins . Therefore , the reliable deter - mination of their 3D molecular structure is essential for the design of potent and spe - ciﬁc antagonists . In several studies , MD and MTD methods , NMR , and docking were used to determine the binding conformation of RGD - , DGR - , and isoDGR - containing cyclopeptides [ 131 , 344 , 345 , 348 , 355 – 357 ] ( Figure 13 ) . The combination of MTD and docking simulations was employed to determine the bind - ing conformation of cyclic peptides containing RGD - , DGR - , and isoDGR - moieties [ 131 , 348 ] . Conformational free energy surface ( FES ) as the function of two CVs , glycin dihedral angles ϕ and ψ , was calculated using well - tempered MTD for four cyclic peptides c ( - RGDf ( NMe ) V - ) , DCGRC , CisoDGRC , and the N - terminal acetylated CisoDGRC ( ac CisoDGRC ) . The MTD - calculated FES revealed that the conformational equilibria of these molecules are differ - ent . The docking of preferred conformations showed that c ( - RGDf ( NMe ) V - ) , CisoDGRC , and ac CisoDGRC preferred conformations that ﬁt inside the α v β 3 binding site , indicat - ing that these extended conformations represent the bioactive conformation of ligands . MTD calculation also shows that the population of the dominant conformer is higher in ac CisoDGRC compared to CisoDGRC . The binding and competition experiments indi - cated that ac CisoDGRC has a stronger binding afﬁnity than CisoDGRC [ 131 ] . The results suggested that the combination of MTD and docking provide the tool for distinguishing between binding and non - binding ligands and can be utilized for lead reﬁnement in silico . To decipher the selectivity of cyclo pentapeptides containing isoDGR motif ( Figure 13c , d ) against α 5 β 1 and α v integrins , the 3D structure of various compounds was determined using NMR measurements , MD calculations , and docking studies [ 344 , 355 ] . The simulations confirmed the typical binding interactions and explained the selectivity of studied compounds . Conformational analysis of the isoDGR cyclopeptides containing bifunctional DKP scaffolds ( Figure 13e ) was performed by combining the measurements NOESY NMR spectra and mixed Monte Carlo / stochastic dynamic [ 358 ] and the implicit water model [ 359 ] . The docking of two preferred conformers into the crystal structure of the α v β 3 integrin revealed meaningful ligand – α v β 3 interactions and identiﬁed the bioactive conformer . Recently , the α v β 6 integrin has attracted research in treating the chronic lung disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) . MD simulations , free energy calculations , and docking were performed to investigate the binding properties of the α v β 6 integrin with its natural ligand and RGD mimetics . Calculations were carried out using a crystal structure of the α v β 6 integrin in complex with the pro - domain of its natural ligand , TGF - β 1 ( PDB code : 4UM9 ) [ 360 ] . The 1 , 8 - naphthyridine moiety was used as a scaffold for potential antagonists . The results underlined hydrogen bond interactions between amino acids from α v and β 6 subunits and ligands and electrostatic interactions between metal cation and ligands . The estimated binding affinities using FEP calculations were in reasonable agreement with the experiment , suggest - ing that many potential antagonists can be generated in silico , avoiding a time - consuming Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 29 of 44 and expensive synthesizing investigation . Recently , a new de novo design algorithm was pub - lished [ 353 ] , and the algorithm’s performance was tested by discovering potential antagonists of the α v β 6 integrin . From the chemical space of approximately 185 , 000 compounds , some novel molecules were suggested for synthesis as potential antagonists . Infection by a foot - and - mouth disease virus commenced by attachment of the viral capsid to the host through RGD - containing α v β 6 integrin [ 361 , 362 ] . Molecular modeling methods were used to decipher the molecular basis of high afﬁnity and speciﬁcity exhib - ited by a developed cyclic peptide [ 346 ] . The conformation of the 10 - mer cyclic peptide ( Figure 13f ) was determined by NMR and docked into the active site of α v β 6 using MD simulations . The cyclic peptides have sub - nanomolar binding afﬁnity against α v β 6 and showed promising results in bioimaging experiments on a human carcinoma cell line . The integrin activation by an inhibitor [ 327 ] can be avoided by agents that bind integrin at sites other than the ligand - binding site . A molecular docking approach was used to discover such compounds [ 354 ] . The authors carried out a randomized docking of a mutated D1 domain of the CD2 protein ( ProAgio ) to a groove in the β I domain of the β 3 subunit of the α v β 3 integrin with several different orientations . From 1000 generated conformers of the 1 : 1 complex of α v β 3 : ProAgio , the structure with the lowest intermolecular interaction energy was selected for analysis . The estimated binding affinity , represented by a dissociation constant , was K D = 4 . 3 nM . It was found that ProAgio binds only to α v β 3 , and not to α IIb β 3 , as a consequence of slight structural differences in the binding site of both integrins . ProAgio was found to induce apoptosis of cells and thus has therapeutic potential targeting integrin using the unique mechanism of action . ProAgio is in Phase 1 clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials . gov Identifier : NCT05085548 , sponsored by ProDa BioTech , LLC ) . Integrin α 5 β 1 is involved in age - related macula degeneration and cancer development . Integrin α 5 β 1 and its ligand ﬁbronectin play critical roles in angiogenesis [ 363 ] . Rational design procedures were used to discover and reﬁne the structure of potent and speciﬁc α 5 β 1 ligand [ 364 ] . Starting from a tyrosine scaffold , the approach utilizing SAR experiments and docking compounds into a developed homology model of α 5 β 1 led to ligands based on an aza - glycine scaffold with afﬁnities of ~ 1 nM and selectivity against α v β 3 that exceed 10 4 - fold ( Figure 14a ) .

Integrin  5  1 is involved in age - related macula degeneration and cancer develop - ment . Integrin  5  1 and its ligand fibronectin play critical roles in angiogenesis [ 368 ] . Ra - tional design procedures were used to discover and refine the structure of potent and specific  5  1 ligand [ 363 ] . Starting from a tyrosine scaffold , the approach utilizing SAR experiments and docking compounds into a developed homology model of  5  1 led to ligands based on an aza - glycine scaffold with affinities of ~ 1nM and selectivity against  v  3 that exceed 10 4 - fold ( Figure 14a ) . The leukocyte integrin  4  1 is associated with various diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis , multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , COPD , and diabetes [ 369 , 370 ] . The  4  1 binds to fibronectin and VCAM - 1 through minimum binding determinant LDV [ 341 ] . Targeting this integrin is challenging because no crystal structure was reported for  4  1 . However , several molecular modeling studies focused on understanding binding interactions and developing specific and potent antagonists were published [ 364 – 366 , 371 – 374 ] . All these studies used homology models based on the crystal structure of the  v  3 complex with cilengitide [ 146 ] . The structural basis for recognizing phenylalanine compounds ( Figure 14b ) by  4  1 was investigated using 128 antagonists [ 364 ] . A pharmacophore model was developed based on the VCAM - 1 structure , then the pseudoreceptor model and 3D - QSAR were de - rived using electrostatic , hydrophobic , and hydrogen bond interactions . A docking exper - iment supported the reliability of the 3D - QSAR model , suggesting its application in the development of potential phenylalanine type of antagonists . Antagonist binding modes of 4 - [ N ’ - ( 2 - methylphenyl ) ureido ] phenylacetyl - Leu - Asp - Val ( PUPA - LDV , Figure 14c ) derivatives were investigated using several modeling meth - ods , including docking , MD simulation , and free energy calculations [ 365 ] . The results revealed that the preferred conformation of PUPA - LDV in solution is similar to the one observed in the binding site of  4  1 . Pharmacophore modeling , virtual screening , and docking methods were employed to design potential lead compounds based on squaric acid , phenylalanine , and quinolinyl Figure 14 .

Pharmacophore modeling , virtual screening , and docking methods were employed to design potential lead compounds based on squaric acid , phenylalanine , and quinolinyl scaffolds [ 366 ] . The derived pharmacophore model from the training set of 110 diverse compounds was used for virtual screening commercial databases containing 110 , 000 diverse compounds , leading to two leads ( Figure 14d ) for developing α 4 β 1 antagonists . The calculated GOLD score for both leads was higher than the GOLD score calculated for the best compound from the training set . Several prolyl - N - isonicotinoyl - ( L ) - 4 - aminophenylalanine derivatives substituted at the proline 4 - position with cyclic amines were prepared , and their activity screened against α 4 β 1 . The compounds with 3 , 3 - diﬂuoropiperidine at the proline 4 - position , N - N - [ ( 3 - cyanobenzene ) sulfonyl ] - 4 ( R ) - ( 3 , 3 - diﬂuoropiperidin - 1 - yl ) - ( L ) - prolyl - 4 - [ ( 30 , 50 - dichloro - isonicotinoyl ) amino ] - ( L ) - phenylalanine , ( MK - 0617 ) was the most potent derivative with IC 50 = 0 . 03 nM . Moreover , MK - 0617 exhibited good receptor occupancy . Interactions of the potent oral antagonist MK - 0617 against α 4 β 1 named ( Figure 14e ) were investigated with docking , MD simulations , and free energy calculations [ 372 ] . The analyses revealed that the studied antagonist binds in an extended conformation , and electrostatic interactions between the carboxyl group of ligand and MIDAS ion are crucial for the ligand potency . However , nonpolar and hydrogen bond interactions are also relevant for the proper ori - entation of antagonists in the integrin binding site . MK - 0617 is in Phase 2b clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials . gov Identiﬁer : NCT05261126 , sponsored by Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC ) . The above - discussed molecules show that despite some drawbacks , the programs to develop integrin - targeting drugs continue . Currently , databases ClinicalTrials . gov and clinicaltrialsregister . eu list more than 120 clinical trials of integrin - based therapeutics . The selected molecules in recent clinical trials and reported data are listed in a recent review [ 24 ] . 7 . Summary and Perspectives Integrins are cell adhesion and signaling glycoproteins with a large number of their receptors within the human body . They are involved in physiological and pathological processes , including tissue growth , inﬂammation , cancer , thrombosis , and autoimmune disorders . The association of integrins with various severe diseases caused an interest in de - veloping agents that modulate integrin functions . The main focus has been on RGD - binding and leukocyte integrins . Despite signiﬁcant efforts focused on integrin - based therapies , the results are unsatisfactory . The development of potent and speciﬁc small molecule inhibitors of integrin – ligand interactions is a challenging task . One of the challenges is that antagonists with sufﬁcient potency in vitro often have poor pharmacokinetics . Another Cells 2023 , 12 , 324 31 of 44 challenge is to develop speciﬁc antagonists . This challenge is inherent to the heterodimeric character of integrins , with the identical subunits being part of several different integrins . Therefore , a characteristic of integrin - based antagonists is often a lack of speciﬁcity . The last three decades documented the enormous progress in understanding integrins’ 3D structure , properties , and behavior and elucidated our knowledge of their biological functions and therapeutic potential . Recent improvement in molecular modeling methods makes them a powerful tool to provide valuable structural and energetic information on the integrin – ligand interactions at the atomic level and thus complement experimental data obtained by biochemical techniques . Therefore , a combination of new biology technologies , medicinal chemistry , and molecular modeling may provide new therapeutic agents with the required pharmacokinetics proﬁle in a rational way .
