We have characterized a human homologue of anillin , a Drosophila actin binding protein . Like Drosophila anillin , the human protein localizes to the nucleus during interphase , the cortex following nuclear envelope breakdown , and the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . Anillin also localizes to ectopic cleavage furrows generated between two spindles in fused PtK 1 cells . Microinjection of antianillin antibodies slows cleavage , leading to furrow regression and the genera - tion of multinucleate cells . GFP fusions that contain the COOH - terminal 197 amino acids of anillin , which in - cludes a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , form ec - topic cortical foci during interphase . The septin Hcdc10 localizes to these ectopic foci , whereas myosin II and actin do not , suggesting that anillin interacts with the septins at the cortex . Robust cleavage furrow localiza - tion requires both this COOH - terminal domain and ad - ditional NH 2 - terminal sequences corresponding to an actin binding domain deﬁned by in vitro cosedimenta - tion assays . Endogenous anillin and Hcdc10 colocalize to punctate foci associated with actin cables throughout mitosis and the accumulation of both proteins at the cell equator requires ﬁlamentous actin . These results in - dicate that anillin is a conserved cleavage furrow com - ponent important for cytokinesis . Interactions with at least two other furrow proteins , actin and the septins , likely contribute to anillin function . Key words : Hedc10 • pleckstrin homology domain • septin • cleavage furrow • cortex Introduction Cytokinesis is the process that partitions the cell surface and cytoplasm of one cell to form two cells ( for reviews see Glotzer , 1997 ; Gould and Simanis , 1997 ; Field et al . , 1999 ; Hales et al . , 1999 ) . To avoid aneuploidy , the cell must suc - cessfully coordinate cytokinesis with chromosome segrega - tion . In animal cells , this coordination is achieved , in part , by assembling the cleavage furrow in response to signals from the late anaphase spindle . The exact nature of this signal - ing remains poorly understood . In animal cells , the cytoplasm is partitioned by ingres - sion of the cleavage furrow . Cleavage furrow ingression requires a contractile cortical ring of actin and myosin II ( for review see Satterwhite and Pollard , 1992 ; for some more recent examples of the role of myosin II during cytokinesis see Bi et al . , 1998 , and Lippincott and Li , 1998 [ Saccharo - myces cerevisiae ] ; Shelton et al . , 1999 [ Caenorhabditis ele - gans ] ; and Benzanilla et al . , 2000 [ Schizosaccharomyces pombe ] ) . Based on EM studies , filamentous actin and my - osin II within the cleavage furrow have been proposed to have a purse string - like organization ( for review see Sat - terwhite and Pollard , 1992 ) . However , more recent work in tissue culture cells and Dictyostelium have called this or - ganization into question ( Fukui and Inoue , 1991 ; Fishkind and Wang , 1993 ; Fishkind et al . , 1996 ; for review see Fish - kind and Wang , 1995 ) . Further work is necessary to clarify the organization of actin and myosin II in different sys - tems , and to relate this organization to the contractile forces generated during cytokinesis . The mechanisms that lead to furrow assembly and that allow the contractile ring to remain associated with the plasma membrane during contraction are also topics of current investigation . In addition to cortical contraction , cleavage furrow in - gression requires new membrane insertion . A role for syntaxin - mediated membrane fusion has been demon - strated during cytokinesis in Arabidobsis ( Lauber et al . , 1997 ) and C . elegans ( Jantsch - Plunger and Glotzer , 1999 ) , and , during cellularization , a cytokinesis - related furrow - ing process in Drosophila embryos ( Burgess et al . , 1997 ) . Nevertheless , for furrowing events in most animal sys - Address correspondence to Karen Oegema , Cell Biology Program , Euro - pean Molecular Biology Laboratory , Meyerhofstrasse 1 , Heidelberg , Ger - many D - 69117 .

In principle , insertion of a new plasma mem - brane could occur anywhere on the surface of the cell . Membrane insertion could also occur before contraction and be stored in structures such as microvilli until addi - tional surface area is required ( Fullilove and Jacobson , 1971 ; Turner and Mahowald , 1977 ) . The process of mem - brane insertion during cleavage has been studied most ex - tensively in Xenopus embryos ( Bluemink and de Laat , 1973 ; Danilchik et al . , 1998 ) . Here , membrane insertion is coupled to furrow ingression and occurs immediately be - hind the furrow tip . Membrane insertion in this system re - quires a specialized MT array , disruption of which can lead to contraction in the absence of membrane insertion , causing the embryo to rupture ( Danilchik et al . , 1998 ) . However , the Xenopus embryo is an extremely large and specialized cell , so it is not clear to what extent mecha - nisms of membrane deposition will be similar in other sys - tems such as vertebrate somatic cells . One approach to understanding furrow assembly and in - gression is to identify the protein components of the cleav - age furrow and the interactions between them , and then study the regulation of these interactions in space and time . A number of cleavage furrow components have now been discovered , and some are evolutionarily conserved . Con - served cleavage furrow components include the following : actin , myosin II , formin homology proteins and IQGAP family members ( thought to regulate actin dynamics ) , and the septin family of small GTPases ( for review see Field et al . , 1999 ) . The septins are found in large protein complexes containing multiple septin family members that can poly - merize to form filaments in vitro ( for review see Field and Kellogg , 1999 ) . Another cleavage furrow component that is likely to function during cytokinesis is anillin . Anillin is a Dro - sophila actin binding protein identified by actin affinity chromatography of embryo extracts . Unlike the septins , actin , and myosin II , anillin specifically localizes to the contractile ring during cytokinesis , and is not found in other contractile actin - rich assemblies such as the stress fibers of cultured cells ( Cramer et al . , 1997 ; Kinoshita et al . , 1997 ) or the apical portions of constricting epithelial cells ( Young et al . , 1991 ; Fares et al . , 1995 ) . This specific - ity suggests a special role in cell division and has made it a useful cytological marker for cleavage furrows in Dro - sophila ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ; Hime et al . , 1996 ; Ad - ams et al . , 1998 ; Giansanti et al . , 1999 ) . Although the mo - lecular function of anillin is not clear , the fact that Drosophila anillin binds to , and bundles , actin filaments in vitro , suggests it might be a structural component of the cleavage furrow . The movement of anillin from the inter - phase nucleus to the cleavage furrow would also be con - sistent , however , with a role in the largely unknown path - ways that signal where and when the furrow assembles . For this reason , we have conducted a phylogenetic and functional analysis of anillin—asking which domains are conserved in evolution , with which other furrow compo - nents it interacts , and how these interactions are regu - lated—with the hope that this information will shed light on the mechanism of cytokinesis .

Cloning and Sequencing of a Human Anillin cDNA A BLAST search of the GenBank database of expressed sequence tags ( dbEST ) revealed a human cDNA ( accession No . R12261 ) with homology to the COOH terminus of Drosophila anillin . PCR primers based on this sequence ( ACGCAAGAATCCCATAGG and GACAGCCAGTTCT - TGGTAAAC ) were used to amplify a 193 - bp region , using human HeLa cell QUICK - Clone cDNA ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ) as a tem - plate . Using this probe , screening of a Uni - Zap XR Library ( HeLa cDNA ; Stratagene ) yielded three related clones , the longest of which ( 4 , 016 bp ) was sequenced . An additional 559 bp of coding sequence and an up - stream , in - frame stop codon were identified using a 5 9 / 3 9 RACE kit ( Boeh - ringer ) and mRNA isolated from HeLa cells using a Quickprep mRNA purification kit ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) to amplify the 5 9 end of human anillin . GFP Constructs To generate a fusion of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) 1 with amino acids 231 – 1 , 125 of human anillin ( hsanillin ) , the KpnI - ApaI fragment from the hsanillin cDNA was ligated into pEGFP - C1 ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ) . To make ( GFP : 231 - 982 , this construct was digested with EcoRI , and the resulting fragment was ligated into pEGFP - C1 cut with EcoRI . To make the full - length construct , GFP : 1 - 1125 , nested PCR using the Pfu polymerase ( Stratagene ) and a human cDNA library ( CLONTECH Lab - oratories , Inc . ) as a template was used to amplify the NH 2 terminus of hsanillin . The internal primers were 5 9 - CGCACGCAAGCTTCGATG - GATCCGTTTACGG - 3 9 and 5 9 - AGACGCATCATCAGCACTTG - 3 9 . This product was digested with HindIII - BstXI and cloned into the GFP : 231 - 1125 – containing vector . To make GFP : 1 - 982 , the HindIII - BstXI PCR fragment was ligated into GFP : 231 - 982 cut with the same enzymes . To make all other GFP fusions , PCR with Vent polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) was used to amplify the appropriate regions . All fragments were digested with HindIII - BamHI and ligated into pEGFP - C1 . Cell Culture and Transfection BHK - 21 cells were cultured and transfected as described ( Heald et al . , 1993 ) . BS - C - 1 ( African green monkey kidney ) cells were cultured in DME with high glucose . For the blot in Fig . 4 , BHK cells were transfected in 6 - well plates . The cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 150 m l of sample buffer . 25 m l of each sample was fractionated on a 12 % SDS - PAGE gel and Western blotted using an anti - GFP antibody ( gift from Aaron Straight , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . Antibody Purification and Labeling Rabbit antibodies to human anillin were raised against a fusion of GST with amino acids 454 – 724 of human anillin . To purify the antibodies , the fusion protein was cleaved with Precision protease ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) to remove the GST and immobilized on Affigel - 10 ( Bio - Rad Lab - oratories ) . The antibodies were purified using standard procedures ( Har - low and Lane , 1988 ) . A synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH - terminal 14 amino acids ( SRTLEKNKKKGKIF ) of Hcdc10 ( Nakatsuru et al . , 1994 ) was used to raise and affinity purify rabbit polyclonal antibod - ies as previously described ( Field et al . , 1998 ) . Labeling of antibodies to Hcdc10 and hsanillin with Oregon green ( Molecular Probes ) and Cy5 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) was performed as previously described ( Francis - Lang et al . , 1999 ) . 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : GFP , green fluorescent protein ; hsanil - lin , human anillin ; PH , pleckstrin homology . on A p r il 14 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 7 , 2000 Oegema et al . Functional Analysis of Human Anillin 541 Fixation , Immunofluorescence , and Microscopy For the anillin immunofluorescence in Fig . 1 , BHK cells were fixed for 5 min with 2 20 methanol and processed using standard procedures ( http : / / iccbweb . med . harvard . edu / mitchisonlab / ) . Antianillin antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 m g / ml . For the visualization of Hcdc10 , actin and anillin in Fig . 7 , BHK cells , grown on coverslips , were fixed for 15 min in 2 % formaldehyde in CBS , washed three times with TBS , permeabi - lized in TBS 1 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min , rinsed twice with TBST , and blocked in AbDil for 10 min . The coverslips were incubated with di - rectly labeled Cy - 5 antianillin and Oregon green anti - Hcdc10 ( both at 2 m g / ml ) for 40 min , washed three times with TBST , incubated with 0 . 05 mg / ml TRITC phalloidin ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) diluted in AbDil for 15 min , washed twice with TBST , and incubated with 1 m g / ml Hoechst in TBST for 5 min . The coverslips were washed twice in TBST and mounted in mounting media ( see Buffers ) containing 70 % glycerol . BHK cells trans - fected with GFP constructs ( see Figs . 5 and 6 ) were fixed for 10 min with 2 % formaldehyde in CBS . The coverslips were washed , permeabilized , and blocked as described above . To stain for Hcdc10 , the cells were incu - bated with 2 m g / ml of directly labeled Cy5 anti - Hcdc10 . Three - dimen - sional images were acquired on a widefield microscope ( DeltaVision ; Ap - plied Precision Inc . ) . Optical sections were taken at 0 . 2 - m m intervals using an Olympus 100 3 , 1 . 4 NA objective and deconvolved using the DeltaVi - sion software . Either single optical sections or projections of the entire cell are shown , as indicated . Antibody Injection Experiments The day before injection , BS - C - 1 cells were plated onto 25 - mm coverslips . For injection and viewing , coverslips were mounted in a water - jacketed coverslip chamber to maintain a temperature of 34 8 C . The chamber was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope and injected and viewed by phase optics . The estimated injection volume is 5 % of cell volume . Two different concentrations of affinity - purified antianillin antibody were in - jected with similar results ( 3 . 4 and 11 mg / ml ) . Random rabbit IgG ( Jack - son ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) at a concentration of 11 mg / ml was injected as a control . For the overnight experiments , interphase cells were injected , and the coverslip was returned to the incubator for 18 – 22 h . Cells were fixed for 10 min in 2 % formaldehyde in PBS and treated as above . Cells were stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( 1 m g / ml ) , Hoechst ( 2 m g / ml ) , and fluorescein anti - rabbit IgG . Injected cells were identified by their bright fluorescein staining . For time - lapse filming , single cells were in - jected at prophase or metaphase and filming began immediately . Images were collected at 20 - s intervals . A cell was deemed to have completed cy - tokinesis when it was no longer possible to make meaningful measure - ments ( i . e . , the curvature of the daughters precluded measurement of the intracellular bridge ) . To determine furrow contraction rates , the distance across the cell at the equator was measured , beginning at anaphase onset . The maximum rate of sustained contraction was determined ( times when contraction was stalled were not used in the determination of contraction rate ) . Fusion and Microscopy of PTK 1 Cells Fusion and microscopy of PtK 1 cells was performed as described previ - ously ( Savoian et al . , 1999 ) . Antianillin antibody was used at a concentra - tion of 4 m g / ml . Cells were fixed z 5 min after formation of the ectopic furrow . Results Identification of a Human Homologue of Anillin Using homology to Drosophila anillin , we cloned a human homologue ( see Materials and Methods ) . The human anil - lin cDNA encodes a 1 , 125 – amino acid protein with a pre - dicted molecular mass of 124 kD and a pI of 8 . 1 . BLAST searches of the databases using the human and Drosophila sequences identify four additional proteins with homology to anillin . These include the predicted products of the Dro - sophila gene CG4530 and the C . elegans genes , Y49E10 . 19 , K10B2 . 5 , and Y43F8C . 14 . All six proteins share an ex - tended region of homology at their COOH termini ( see alignment in Fig . 1 A ) . This region includes a COOH - ter - minal pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( Fig . 1 A , located between 330 and 480 on the ruler ) and additional NH 2 - ter - minal sequences ( located between 1 and 330 on the ruler ) that likely contain an additional conserved globular domain . The NH 2 termini of the six proteins are less conserved . Pairwise alignments ( Tatusova and Madden , 1999 ) indi - cate that the human and Drosophila sequences are homol - ogous along their entire lengths , although the level of con - servation is significantly higher in the COOH - terminal third of the protein ( Fig . 1 B ) . The COOH - terminal PH domain is the most conserved part of the protein ( 54 % identity be - tween human and Drosophila ) . Also conserved between the human and Drosophila sequences are several consen - sus nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ; Robbins et al . , 1991 ; Hicks and Raikhel , 1995 ) and one consensus SH3 binding motif ( Ren et al . , 1993 ; Lim et al . , 1994 ) . In con - trast , pairwise alignments reveal no significant homology between the NH 2 termini of the predicted Drosophila pro - tein CG4530 or the C . elegans protein Y43F8C . 14 and the human and Drosophila NH 2 - terminal sequences . An inter - mediate level of NH 2 - terminal homology is detected be - tween the C . elegans proteins , Y49E10 . 19 and K10B2 . 5 , and the human and Drosophila proteins . These results indicate that anillin is conserved among metazoans and that at least some organisms may have more than one protein with ho - mology to anillin . Whether these homologous proteins are functionally redundant or involved in disparate processes remains to be determined . To further characterize the human anillin homologue , we raised and affinity - purified an antibody to amino acids 454 – 724 of the human protein . Using this antibody , West - ern blots of extracts from multiple mammalian cell lines re - vealed a single band migrating at z 180 kD ( Fig . 1 C ) , which is a molecular mass significantly larger than the predicted molecular mass of 124 kD . A similar difference between the apparent molecular mass and predicted molecular mass was observed for Drosophila anillin ( see Discussion in Field and Alberts , 1995 ) . The localization of the human protein is essentially the same as that of Drosophila anillin ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ) . In mammalian tissue culture cells ( Fig . 1 D ) , anillin concentrates in the nucleus during interphase , although some anillin also appears punctate in the cyto - plasm and at the cortex . During mitosis , anillin is enriched at the cortex . Anillin accumulates in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis and prominently stains the cortex sur - rounding the midbody late in telophase . The only known molecular interaction of Drosophila anillin is to bind to actin filaments in vitro . In the Dro - sophila protein , the actin binding domain has been mapped to the NH 2 terminus ( Fig . 1 B ) . To test if the human pro - tein could also bind actin , fragments of human anillin were expressed and purified from bacteria , and an actin cosedi - mentation experiment was performed . We found that frag - ments corresponding to amino acids 1 – 677 and 231 – 677 of human anillin bound to actin filaments . More COOH - ter - minal fragments corresponding to amino acids 454 – 724 and 983 – 1 , 125 of human anillin did not bind actin ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that the minimal actin binding domain for the human protein likely lies between amino acids 231 and 454 , similar to its location in the Dro - on A p r il 14 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 7 , 2000 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 542 sophila protein . The actin binding of fragment 231 – 677 was less efficient than that of 1 – 677 , suggesting that , as is the case in Drosophila , additional NH 2 - terminal sequences may influence actin binding . Injection of Antibodies to Anillin Slows Furrow Ingression and Leads to Failure of Cytokinesis To determine if anillin is important for cytokinesis , we in - jected affinity - purified antibody against human anillin into Figure 1 . Characterization of an anillin homo - logue . ( A ) An alignment of the conserved COOH - terminal region of anillin homologues found in blast searches of the databases . The aligned sequences are human anillin ( this report ; GenBank accession No . AF273437 ) ; Drosophila anillin ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ; GenBank acces - sion No . X89858 ) ; the products of the C . elegans genes K10B2 . 5 ( GenBank accession No . T16604 ) , Y43F8C . 14 ( GenBank accession No . T26874 ) , and Y49E10 . 19 ( GenBank accession No . T27053 ) ; and the product of the Drosophila gene CG4530 ( GenBank accession No . AAF47044 ) . The sequences were aligned with ClustalX ( Thompson et al . , 1997 ) using the default set - tings . The asterisk indicate positions where the amino acid is identical in all six sequences ; a sin - gle dot indicates positions where the amino acids of all sequences fall into a weak similarity group ; and a double dot indicates positions where the amino acids of all sequences fall into a strong similarity group . The PH domain is underlined . ( B ) A schematic comparison of Drosophila and human anillin homologues . The overall level of identity between the two proteins is 25 % . The COOH - terminal third of the protein is the most conserved ( z 36 % identity ) . This region includes a PH domain ( human , amino acids 985 – 1 , 110 ; Drosophila , amino acids 1 , 069 – 1 , 194 ) , which is 54 % identical between the two proteins . The minimal sequences required for actin binding ( amino acids 258 – 340 , indicated here in black ) and bundling ( amino acids 246 – 371 ) have been mapped for the Drosophila protein ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ) . A larger region of the Drosophila protein ( amino acids 127 – 371 , shown here in me - dium gray ) was found to stabilize actin binding and bundling . The locations of potential nuclear localization sequences , identified using the pro - gram PSORT II ( Nakai and Horton , 1999 ) , are indicated with black triangles ( human , amino ac - ids 64 , 66 , 195 , 786 , 896 , and 1 , 021 ; Drosophila , amino acids 996 and 1 , 105 ) . Also conserved is a potential SH3 binding motif . There is one SH3 binding consensus in the human and two in the Drosophila sequence ( indicated here with aster - isks ) . ( C ) An affinity - purified antibody against hsanillin recognizes a single band in extracts of mammalian cells . A Western blot of cell extracts probed with affinity - purified antibodies to hsanillin . Extracts of BHK - 21 , BS - C - 1 , and HeLa cells were loaded . In all cases , a single band running at z 180 kD is detected . ( D ) hsanillin , like the Drosophila protein , has a dynamic cell cycle – dependent localization pattern . Methanol - fixed BHK cells were stained for hsanillin . Three - dimensional widefield data was collected and deconvolved . The interphase cell is a projec - tion of the entire stack ; the other images are selected sections . In interphase cells , hsanillin is found primarily in the nucleus , upon nu - clear envelope breakdown , hsanillin becomes enriched at the cortex . During cytokinesis , the protein localizes to the cleavage furrow . In late telophase , anillin is concentrated in the cortex surrounding the midbody . on A p r il 14 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 7 , 2000 Oegema et al . Functional Analysis of Human Anillin 543 monkey cells ( BS - C - 1 ) . Random rabbit IgG at the same concentration was injected as a control . After injection , the cells were cultured for 18 – 22 h , fixed , and processed for immunofluorescence ( see Materials and Methods ) . The number of nuclei per cell was counted . 89 % ( 54 / 61 ) of the cells injected with the antianillin antibody had two or more nuclei compared with 7 % ( 3 / 46 ) of injected control cells . The multinucleate cells resulting from the antianillin injection were well spread and contained actin stress fibers ( data not shown ) . These data suggest a role for anillin in cytokinesis but not cell spreading or cell cycle progression . A failure of cytokinesis can arise from a failure in furrow assembly , ingression ( contraction or perhaps membrane insertion ) , or from a failure of completion , which is the fi - nal step that resolves the contracted cortex to generate two topologically distinct cells . To quantitatively analyze cytokinesis in the antibody - injected cells , cells were in - jected with antianillin antibody in prophase or metaphase ( before formation of the cleavage furrow ) and time - lapse – imaged using phase - contrast optics . The width of the fur - row near the cell equator was measured and plotted versus time . In all cells injected with anillin antibody , the cleav - age furrow formed and began to contract . The timing of furrow initiation was not significantly different between experimental ( average 204 6 31 . 7 s ) and uninjected con - trol cells ( average 225 6 80 s ) . However , the rate of furrow contraction of the antibody - injected cells was significantly slower ( P , 0 . 001 ; Fig . 2 C ) than that of control cells . The rate of furrow contraction of the antibody - injected cells ( 0 . 94 6 0 . 28 m m / min ) was about half that of the control cells ( 2 . 09 6 0 . 63 m m / min ) . In 6 / 9 cells injected with the antianillin antibody , furrow ingression ultimately halted and reversed ( Fig . 2 ) . In the three cells where the furrow persisted , ingression eventually stalled and did not reini - tiate in the time frame of the experiment ( 36 , 48 , and 54 min ) . Control cells took an average of 9 min to complete cytokinesis . Cumulatively , these results suggest that anillin is important for cytokinesis and may have a role in the as - sembly , stability , or contractile activity of the cleavage furrow . Anillin Localizes to Ectopic Rappaport Furrows in Fused PTK 1 Cells Recently , a system using fused PTK 1 cells was developed to help assess the minimum protein complement necessary to accomplish cytokinesis ( Savoian et al . , 1999 ) . In fused cells , two spindles exist within one cytoplasm . During cy - Figure 2 . Cytokinesis fails in cells microinjected with antianil - lin antibody .

This type of ectopic furrow was previously charac - terized in echinoderms by Rappaport ( 1961 ) . Since both types of furrows are functional , components essential for cleavage should be present in both . In contrast , compo - nents that fortuitously accumulate in the cleavage furrow may be found only in spindle - bisecting furrows . We exam - ined the localization of anillin in this system and found that anillin localized to all functional furrows , both spindle bisecting and ectopic , which is consistent with the idea that anillin is a ubiquitous component of cleavage furrows ( Fig . 3 ) . Robust Recruitment of Anillin to the Cleavage Furrow Requires both the PH and Actin Binding Domains To examine the domains of anillin required for its localiza - tion , we transfected BHK cells with a series of constructs that fuse GFP to regions of anillin ( summarized in Fig . 4 ) . Fusions of GFP with full - length anillin and anillin lacking the NH 2 - terminal 230 amino acids were recruited to the cortex normally during metaphase ( Fig . 5 , top panel , amino acids 1 – 1 , 125 and 231 – 1 , 125 ) , and localized robustly to cleavage furrows during cytokinesis ( Fig 5 , lower panel , amino acids 1 – 1 , 125 and 231 – 1 , 125 ) . The localization of these two constructs was identical , except that the fusion with amino acids 231 – 1 , 125 failed to localize to nuclei dur - ing interphase ( see summary in Fig . 4 ) . This suggests that the functionally important NLS may be one of the consen - sus sequences found in the first 230 amino acids ( Fig . 1 B ) . Fusions with amino acids 1 – 982 or 231 – 982 that contain the actin binding domain but delete the PH domain were not recruited to the cortex during metaphase ( Fig . 5 , top panel , amino acids 1 – 982 ) and were only very weakly en - riched in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis ( Fig . 5 , bottom panel amino acids 231 – 982 ) . Both of these fusions localized to the midbody late in cytokinesis ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , a fusion of GFP with the COOH - terminal 395 amino acids of anillin , which lacks the actin binding domain , showed no cortical enrichment during metaphase ( Fig . 5 , top panel , amino acids 731 – 1 , 125 ) , but was clearly recruited to the cleavage furrow during cytoki - nesis ( Fig . 5 , bottom panel , amino acids 731 – 1 , 125 ) . Fu - sions of GFP with smaller regions of the COOH terminus ( Fig . 5 , bottom panel , amino acids 929 – 1 , 125 and 983 – 1 , 125 ) were not recruited to either the cortex during mito - sis or the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . These results suggest that robust recruitment to the cortex and cleavage furrow require both the PH and actin binding domains of anillin . However , a significant amount of cleavage furrow Figure 3 .

Functional Analysis of Human Anillin 545 localization can occur independently of the actin binding domain . GFP Fusions Containing the Extended PH Domain Form Ectopic Foci that Contain Hcdc10 During interphase , anillin is primarily a nuclear protein . However , we found that all constructs that contained the COOH - terminal 197 amino acids of anillin ( Fig . 4 , amino acids 929 – 1 , 125 ) could form ectopic cortical foci when overexpressed during interphase ( Fig . 6 ) . This region of anillin , which we refer to as the extended PH domain , cor - responds to the PH domain plus an additional 56 amino acids more NH 2 - terminal . Deletion of the PH domain abolished the ability to form foci , however , the PH domain itself is not sufficient to confer the ability to form these structures ( data not shown ) . We examined the ectopic foci using probes for actin , myosin II , endogenous anillin ( us - Figure 4 . Hsanillin domain analysis . ( A ) Schematic of the re - gions of human anillin that were fused to GFP for transfection into BHK cells . All fusions shown here and in the images in Fig . 5 had GFP fused to their NH 2 terminus . However , the full - length protein as well as the regions 455 – 724 , 731 – 1 , 125 , and 983 – 1 , 125 were also tested with GFP fused to their COOH terminus . In all cases , these constructs gave the same localization as the NH 2 - ter - minal fusions . The chart on the right summarizes the localization of the tested fragments . For examples , see Fig . 5 . ( B ) Western blot of cells transfected with each of the NH 2 - terminal GFP fusions . Samples were fractionated on a 12 % SDS - PAGE gel , transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with an anti - body to GFP . Figure 5 . Both the actin binding domain and the PH domain are required for recruitment of anillin to the cortex and for efficient recruitment to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . BHK cells were transfected with the indicated GFP constructs and were fixed and stained for DNA . ( Top ) Cortical recruitment of se - lected fragments of anillin fused to GFP during metaphase . Full - length anillin ( 1 – 1 , 125 ) and a fragment , which deletes the first 231 amino acids , are efficiently recruited to the cortex during metaphase . No cortical enrichment of GFP fusions , which delete the actin binding region ( 731 – 1 , 125 ) or the PH domain ( 1 – 982 ) , is observed . ( Bottom ) Full - length anillin ( 1 – 1 , 125 ) and a fragment that deletes the NH 2 terminus ( 231 – 1 , 125 ) are efficiently re - cruited to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . The COOH terminus ( 731 – 1 , 125 ) is also recruited to the cleavage furrow , but less efficiently . The PH domain alone ( 983 – 1 , 125 ) or a slightly longer region that contains the PH domain ( the extended PH do - main , 929 – 1 , 125 ) are not sufficient to direct GFP to the cleavage furrow . GFP fusions that delete only the PH domain ( 1 – 982 ; not shown ) or the PH domain and the first 230 amino acids ( 231 – 982 ) were very weakly enriched in the cleavage furrow . on A p r il 14 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 7 , 2000 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 546 ing an antibody raised against a nonoverlapping frag - ment ) , and the septin Hcdc10 ( Nakatsuru et al . , 1994 ) . This septin is known to localize to cleavage furrows in mammalian cells and to be part of a complex of proteins that has been found to associate with the exocyst complex ( Hsu et al . , 1998 ) . It is presumably a marker for a complex of septin proteins . Hcdc10 localized to the ectopic foci ( Fig . 6 ) , but endogenous anillin , actin , and myosin II did not ( data not shown ) . Hcdc10 localized to the ectopic foci formed by all anillin fusions ( Fig . 6 ) . These results suggest that anillin may interact with the septins at the cortex in - dependently of actin or myosin II , and that the extended PH domain ( amino acids 929 – 1 , 125 ) is responsible for this interaction . Most constructs formed punctate foci , however , the fusion of GFP with the COOH - terminal 395 amino ac - ids of anillin also formed very homogeneous small rings ( Fig . 6 , bottom row ) with an outer diameter of 0 . 6 6 0 . 04 m m . Anillin and Hcdc10 Colocalize to Foci Associated with Actin Cables and Are Simultaneously Recruited to the Cleavage Furrow The GFP fusion data suggested a possible association be - tween anillin and the septins at the cortex . To test if this association could be observed in untransfected cells , we stained BHK cells for actin , Hcdc10 , and anillin ( Fig . 7 ) and performed three - dimensional widefield deconvolution microscopy . We found that Hcdc10 and anillin colocalized to punctate cortical structures throughout mitosis . These puncta were smaller than the ectopic cortical foci formed in cells overexpressing GFP - anillin fusions . Nearly all punctate structures that contained anillin also contained Hcdc10 . However , some Hcdc10 - containing puncta , par - ticularly those outside the cleavage furrow and near the periphery of the cells did not contain anillin ( Fig 7 ; Late anaphase and Telophase ) . Interestingly , we found that the majority of septin and anillin puncta were aligned along actin cables throughout mitosis . We also observed punc - tate foci of myosin II aligned along actin cables during fur - row assembly ( data not shown ) ; but , at our current resolu - tion , myosin II appeared to be less coincident with anillin than Hcdc10 . During metaphase and early anaphase , the actin cables appeared to encircle the cells ( Fig . 7 , Metaphase and Early anaphase ) . In late anaphase , as the sides of the cells began to flatten to give the cell a capsule - like shape , the cortical actin cables in the cleavage furrow were pri - Figure 6 . GFP fusions with regions of anillin that contain the COOH - terminal 197 amino acids form ectopic cortical foci during interphase . The septin Hcdc10 also localizes to these foci . BHK cells were transfected with the indicated GFP constructs , fixed , and stained for DNA and the septin Hcdc10 . Fusions of GFP with full - length anillin ( 1 – 1 , 125 ) or with the anillin COOH termi - nus ( 731 – 1 , 125 ) form ectopic cortical foci when overexpressed in interphase cells . The septin Hcdc10 localizes to these foci . A fusion of GFP with the COOH - terminal 197 amino acids of an - illin ( 929 – 1 , 125 ) is sufficient to form ectopic foci that colocalize Hcdc10 , but these foci tend to be a bit larger and often appear to be beneath the cortex . ( Bottom row ) Fusions of GFP with the COOH - terminal 395 amino acids of anillin ( 731 – 1 , 125 ) also often formed ringlike foci . Hcdc10 also colocalized to these rings . on A p r il 14 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 7 , 2000 Oegema et al . Functional Analysis of Human Anillin 547 Figure 7 . Anillin and Hcdc10 are found in punctate foci that localize along actin cables during mitosis in BHK cells . BHK cells were fixed and stained for actin , Hcdc10 , anillin , and DNA . Three - dimensional widefield data sets were collected and deconvolved . Shown are projections of entire cells . During metaphase and early anaphase , actin is found in cables that often appear to encircle the cell . Dur - ing late anaphase , as the cell initiates contraction , the actin cables appear to align parallel to the spindle axis . As contraction proceeds , more actin cables within the cleavage furrow are observed perpendicular to the spindle axis but , within the actively contracting region near the base of the cell , the actin cables are still parallel to the spindle axis . During all phases of mitosis , anillin and Hcdc10 colocalize to foci that align along actin cables . on A p r il 14 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 7 , 2000 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 548 marily aligned along the spindle axis . These axially aligned actin filaments appeared to be enriched on the sides of the cell ( Fig . 7 , Late anaphase ) , although we also observed them on the top surfaces of some cleavage furrows . Later in telophase , actin cables perpendicular to the spindle axis were also observed . However , these cables were generally enriched to either side of the center of the cleavage furrow and often appeared to encircle the daughter cells rather than to form a circumferential ring at the equator ( Fig . 7 , Telophase ) . We also examined the relative timing of recruitment of anillin and Hcdc10 to the cortex and to the cleavage fur - row ( a sample field of cells is shown in Fig . 8 A ) . During interphase , when anillin was primarily nuclear , the septin Hcdc10 was already found in punctate cortical foci . We should note that the nuclear localization of anillin is more prominent in methanol - fixed cells ( Fig . 1 D ) than in cells fixed with formaldehyde ( Fig . 8 A ) . In metaphase cells , an - illin and Hcdc10 colocalize to punctate cortical foci . In anaphase and telophase cells , foci containing anillin and Hcdc10 are found in the cleavage furrow . The timing of cleavage furrow recruitment was identical for the two pro - teins . Whenever we detected a concentration of one com - ponent near the equator , the other was always present . The extent of the region of the cortex where the proteins were enriched was identical throughout furrow assembly and ingression . The timing of furrow recruitment and the extent of the region of enrichment was also identical for myosin II ( data not shown ) . Anillin and Septins Localize to the Cortex in the Absence of Actin The localization of anillin and the septin Hcdc10 along ac - tin cables between metaphase and telophase suggested that filamentous actin might be important for their concentra - tion in the furrow . To test if actin filaments are required for anillin and septin localization during cytokinesis , we treated cells with the actin depolymerizing drugs latruncu - lin A or latrunculin B , fixed , stained , and imaged cells in late mitosis . As expected ( Spector et al . , 1989 ) , no cleav - age furrow was formed in the presence of either drug , and filamentous actin was reduced in amount and disorganized in location ( Fig . 8 B ) . In the absence of a furrow , it is diffi - cult to distinguish anaphase and telophase , but anillin was not localized to the equator in any postanaphase cells we observed after latrunculin A treatment . However , both proteins were still colocalized in foci and largely restricted to the cortex . We conclude that anillin - septin colocaliza - tion and maintenance of their association with the cortex do not depend on organized , filamentous actin , whereas their localization to the presumptive cleavage furrow does . Figure 8 . Anillin and the septin Hcdc10 colocalize on the cortex of latrunculin - treated cells but do not accumulate in the cleavage furrow . ( A ) A typical field of BHK cells fixed and stained for DNA ( top ) , anillin ( bottom , red ) , and Hcdc10 ( bottom , green ) . Three - dimensional widefield data sets were collected and decon - volved . A projection of the field is shown . During interphase ( I ) Hcdc10 is present in punctate cortical structures on the cortex . Anillin is in the nuclei of most , but not all , interphase cells . Note that the nuclear staining is somewhat weaker in formaldehyde - fixed cells compared with the methanol - fixed cells shown in Fig . 1 . At metaphase ( M ) , anillin concentrates at the cortex where it colocalizes with septin foci . At telophase ( T ) , foci containing an - illin and Hcdc10 are concentrated in the cleavage furrow . ( B ) BHK cells grown on coverslips were treated with 2 m g / ml latrun - culin A ( a gift from Miranda Sanders and Phil Crews , University of California , Santa Cruz ) or latrunculin B ( Calbiochem ) in nor - mal culture media for 60 min before processing for immunofluo - rescence . In the left panel , a merge of DNA ( red ) and actin ( green ) is shown . In the right panels , a merge of anillin ( red ) and the septin Hcdc10 ( green ) is shown . Images were collected as de - scribed for Fig . 7 and are projections of entire cells . When the ac - tin is depolymerized by latrunculin treatment , neither Hcdc10 nor anillin are recruited to the cell equator during mitosis ; in - stead , they colocalize to large cortical spots . on A p r il 14 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 7 , 2000 Oegema et al . Functional Analysis of Human Anillin 549 Discussion Anillin Is Conserved among Metazoans Human and Drosophila anillin share several conserved fea - tures including the presence of consensus nuclear localiza - tion and SH3 binding sequences , and a COOH - terminal PH domain . The existence of an anillin homologue in Xe - nopus laevis ( Straight , A . , personal communication ) and of multiple anillin homologues in C . elegans ( this report ) indicates conservation of anillin among metazoans . Al - though S . cerevisiae does not appear to have an anillin homologue , the Mid - 1 protein , which is required for septa - tion in the fission yeast S . pombe , is similar to anillin in lo - calization ( nucleus and cleavage furrow ) and also contains a COOH - terminal PH domain . However , there is no other obvious sequence homology ( Bähler et al . , 1998 ) . Anillin Function Is Important for Cytokinesis Injection of antibodies to anillin into mammalian tissue culture cells slows the rate of furrow ingression and pre - vents the completion of cytokinesis . To more precisely de - fine the pathway in which it acts , it is useful to consider the subprocesses that together comprise cytokinesis ( for re - views see Saunders and Field , 1994 ; Glotzer , 1997 ; Field et al . , 1999 ) . Inititation , a signaling process that determines where and when the furrow assembles ( for reviews see Rappa - port , 1996 ; Oegema and Mitchison , 1997 ) , is thought to de - pend on components positioned by the late anaphase spin - dle microtubules , such as kinesins , kinases , and perhaps chromosomal passenger proteins . Furrow assembly de - pends on cortical components and the actin cytoskeleton . Furrow ingression can be subdivided into two subpro - cesses , furrow contraction , which depends on actin and myosin II ( for review see Satterwhite and Pollard , 1992 ) and membrane insertion , which has been shown in a num - ber of systems to require vesicle targeting and exocytic mechanisms ( Bluemink and de Laat , 1973 ; Burgess et al . , 1997 ; Lauber et al . , 1997 ; Danilchik et al . , 1998 ; Jantsch - Plunger and Glotzer , 1999 ) . The relative importance of contraction and membrane insertion during furrow ingres - sion is likely to depend on the system , and has not yet been assessed for vertebrate somatic cells . Finally comple - tion , the process by which the surface area of the cell is fi - nally partitioned , is thought to require midbody microtu - bules and membrane fusion events ( for review see Field et al . , 1999 ) . Our localization and antibody injection data suggest that anillin functions during furrow assembly or in - gression , and possibly in completion , but not in initiation . Within ingression , we cannot yet determine whether anil - lin is required primarily for furrow contraction or mem - brane insertion . The close association of anillin with actin cables in the furrow suggests a role in furrow assembly or contraction . However , the close association of anillin with septins , which have in turn been implicated in exocytotic regulation ( Hsu et al . , 1998 ; Beites et al . , 1999 ) , suggests that a role in membrane insertion cannot be ruled out . Functional Domains of Anillin The Conserved COOH Terminus . Both sequence conserva - tion and localization of GFP fusions suggest a critical role for the COOH - terminal third of anillin ( amino acids 731 – 1 , 125 ) that contains the PH domain . When fused to GFP , this domain is sufficient to confer localization to ectopic cortical foci containing the septin Hcdc10 in interphase cells and clear , although relatively weak , localization to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . The COOH - termi - nal PH domain and an additional 56 amino acids NH 2 ter - minal ( amino acids 929 – 1 , 125 , the extended PH domain ) is sufficient to mediate a tight colocalization between anillin and the septins at the cortex during interphase . The full - length endogenous anillin also colocalizes with septins in the cortical foci during mitosis . This colocalization could be explained by a direct physical interaction between the extended PH domain and the septin complex or by cotar - geting to some cortical structure without a direct interac - tion . So far , we have not seen a direct anillin – septin inter - action in coimmunoprecipitation experiments . However , these experiments were performed on soluble , as opposed to membrane - bound , protein pools , and the GTP binding status of the septin complex was not manipulated ( Oe - gema , K . , and C . Field , unpublished results ) . The PH Domain . The COOH - terminal anillin PH do - main is necessary for all targeting events , including the for - mation of ectopic septin – containing foci in cells overex - pressing anillin GFP fusions , but is not on its own sufficient to confer any specific localization . PH domains are protein modules of z 120 amino acids thought to medi - ate recruitment of proteins to the plasma membrane through interactions with lipids ( Blomberg et al . , 1999 ) . Structural studies indicate that PH domains are electro - statically polarized with a positively charged face that has been postulated to confer the affinity and specificity for different lipids ( Lemmon et al . , 1996 ; Rameh et al . , 1997 ) . The anillin PH domain is closest in charge to the PH do - mains of spectrin and dynamin that bind phosphoinosi - tides relatively weakly and nonspecifically . These low affin - ity PH domains are thought to confer membrane targeting upon oligomerization ( Klein et al . , 1998 ) or in conjunction with other domains of the protein ( Lemmon et al . , 1996 ) . In addition to lipid binding by the anillin PH domain , an interaction with the septins may also be required to target anillin to the cortex . During interphase in BHK cells , the septin Hcdc10 is present on the cortex in the absence of anillin ( Fig . 8 A ) . Anillin may localize to the cortex by tar - geting to septin - containing cortical structures when re - leased from the nucleus upon entry into mitosis . Cortical targeting of septins may occur by direct association with membranes , as suggested by recent data that the mamma - lian septin H5 binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate ( Zhang et al . , 1999 ) . The NH 2 - terminal Actin - binding Domain . Anillin also has a conserved NH 2 - terminal actin - binding domain required for both robust cleavage furrow localization and cortical localization at metaphase . Careful colocalization shows that endogenous anillin / septin foci coalign with actin ca - bles throughout mitosis . During cytokinesis , actin cables tend to align along the spindle axis , rather than circumfer - entially as a simple purse string model might predict . The limitations of the purse string model , and possible implica - tions of noncircumferential actin cables have been dis - cussed elsewhere ( Fukui and Inoue , 1991 ; Fishkind and Wang , 1995 ) . The fact that anillin can bind directly to actin on A p r il 14 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 7 , 2000 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 550 in vitro makes it an attractive candidate to mediate the alignment of anillin / septin - containing foci along actin ca - bles . However , the possibility that the colocalization of an - illin / septin foci along actin cables is mediated by interac - tions between actin and the septins cannot be ruled out ( Kinoshita et al . , 1997 ; Glotzer , 1997 ) . Treatment of cells with actin - depolymerizing drugs abolished the accumula - tion of anillin and Hcdc10 in the cleavage furrow . How - ever , anillin and the septins remain associated with the cortex in the latrunculin - treated cells , suggesting that main - tenance of their cortical localization does not require actin . Experiments examining the kinetics of recruitment will be required to determine if targeting of anillin and Hcdc10 to the cortex can occur normally in the absence of actin . Cumulatively , our results suggest that anillin may func - tion together with the septins , actin , and myosin II during the assembly and ingression of the cleavage furrow . What might anillin be doing during cytokinesis ? Anillin is an ac - tin - binding protein , and fragments of Drosophila anillin also bundle actin . Therefore , anillin could have a role in the formation or organization of actin cables in the cleav - age furrow or in the dynamics of actin organization during cleavage . Another attractive model is that anillin might mediate interactions between actin and the septin / mem - brane cytoskeleton , perhaps linking the cleavage furrow to the plasma membrane . These interactions could be impor - tant for cleavage furrow assembly or for maintaining struc - tural integrity and membrane attachment of the cleavage furrow during contraction .
