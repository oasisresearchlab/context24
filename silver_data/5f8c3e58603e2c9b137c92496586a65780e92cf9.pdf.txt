Received : 2022 . 05 . 23 ; Accepted : 2022 . 08 . 29 ; Published : 2022 . 09 . 06 Abstract Rationale : Hyperactivation of Hippo - Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) signaling pathway governs tumorigenesis of gastric cancer ( GC ) . Here we reveal that minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 ( MCM6 ) is a critical transcriptional target of YAP in GC . We aim to investigate the function , mechanism of action , and clinical implication of MCM6 in GC . Methods : The downstream targets of YAP were screened by RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) and microarray , and further validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR and luciferase reporter assays . The clinical implication of MCM6 was assessed in multiple GC cohorts . Biological function of MCM6 was evaluated in vitro , in patient - derived organoids , and in vivo . RNA - seq was performed to unravel downstream signaling of MCM6 . Potential MCM6 inhibitor was identified and the effect of MCM6 inhibition on GC growth was evaluated . Results : Integrative RNA sequencing and microarray analyses revealed MCM6 as a potential YAP downstream target in GC . The YAP - TEAD complex bound to the promoter of MCM6 to induce its transcription . Increased MCM6 expression was commonly observed in human GC tissues and predicted poor patients survival . MCM6 knockdown suppressed proliferation and migration of GC cells and patient - derived organoids , and attenuated xenograft growth and peritoneal metastasis in mice . Mechanistically , MCM6 activated PI3K / Akt / GSK3 β signaling to support YAP - potentiated gastric tumorigenicity and metastasis . Furthermore , MCM6 deficiency sensitized GC cells to chemo - or radiotherapy by causing DNA breaks and blocking ATR / Chk1 - mediated DNA damage response ( DDR ) , leading to exacerbated cell death and tumor regression . As there are no available MCM6 inhibitors , we performed high - throughput virtual screening and identified purpureaside C as a novel MCM6 inhibitor . Purpureaside C not only suppressed GC growth but also synergized with 5 - fluorouracil to induce cell death . Conclusions : Hyperactivated YAP in GC induces MCM6 transcription via binding to its promoter . YAP - MCM6 axis facilitates GC progression by inducing PI3K / Akt signaling . Targeting MCM6 suppresses GC growth and sensitizes GC cells to genotoxic agents by modulating ATR / Chk1 - dependent DDR , providing a promising strategy for GC treatment .

Ivyspring International Publisher Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6510 Introduction Globally , gastric cancer ( GC ) ranks the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer - related mortality , with an estimated 1 , 089 , 103 new cases and 768 , 793 deaths in 2020 [ 1 ] . Surgical resection remains the primary option for GC ; however , most GC patients are diagnosed at late stages with lymph node metastasis and not eligible to receive curative surgical treatment [ 2 ] . Although several therapeutic strategies such as chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and immunotherapy are currently available for advanced GC patients , their survival benefits are still unsatisfactory possibly due to the modest response rate and acquired resistance [ 3 ] . This situation urges the exploration of molecular mechanisms underlying GC pathogenesis to provide new insights into effective GC treatment . Emerging evidence has pinpointed the critical role of Hippo signaling pathway in tumor malignancy as it promotes tumorigenesis , metastasis , and therapy resistance [ 4 ] . Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) , the principal transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway , interacts with transcription factor TEAD to control the expression of downstream targets which are involved in cell proliferation and survival [ 5 ] . Deregulated YAP is responsible for aggressive tumor properties across diverse human cancers , including GC [ 6 , 7 ] . Previously we revealed that hyperactive or nuclear enriched YAP promoted gastric malignancy and was associated with poor prognosis of GC patients [ 7 ] . Nevertheless , our understanding of YAP transcriptional targets that contribute to GC growth and therapy resistance is still insufficient . To this end , we performed RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) and microarray in different GC cell lines with or without depletion of YAP which unanimously identified minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 ( MCM6 ) as a potent target of YAP . MCM6 is a highly conserved DNA helicase that form a heterohexameric complex with other members of the MCM family to regulate DNA replication , especially during the initiation and elongation stages [ 8 ] . MCM6 is found to be overexpressed in several cancer types , including gastrointestinal cancers [ 9 - 12 ] , breast cancer [ 13 ] , neuroblastoma [ 14 ] , and mantle cell lymphoma [ 15 ] , and contributes to cancer development [ 16 ] . High MCM6 expression has been reported to be associated with poor survival of cancer patients [ 9 , 10 , 12 ] . However , current knowledge regarding the association between YAP and MCM6 and their functional role in gastric carcinogenesis remains largely unexplored . Our study identified MCM6 as a novel transcriptional target of YAP in GC . Upregulation of MCM6 in GC was correlated with overexpressed YAP and predicted poor survival of GC patients . YAP - MCM6 axis potentiated GC cell proliferation and metastasis by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase / protein kinase B ( PI3K / Akt ) pathway . Depletion of MCM6 abolished GC tumor growth and sensitized GC to standard cytotoxic treatments via suppression of the DNA damage - induced ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 - related protein / checkpoint kinase 1 ( ATR / Chk1 ) signaling . Using high - throughput virtual screening , we discovered a novel MCM6 inhibitor , purpureaside C , which exhibited a strong anti - GC effect . Together , our study pinpoints MCM6 as a promising prognostic factor and therapeutic target for GC patients . Materials and Methods Human tissue samples Two independent cohorts of GC tissue microarrays were used in this study . Hong Kong cohort containing 264 cases of GC tumor was collected between 1998 and 2006 from Prince of Wales Hospital with complete clinicopathologic and follow - up information ( Table S1 ) . Beijing cohort with 162 tumor tissues was collected from Peking University Cancer Hospital , China . The study was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong - New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee ( CREC Ref . No . : 2021 - 083 ) and Peking University . Cell and organoid cultures Human GC cell lines ( AGS , BGC - 823 , Kato III , MGC - 803 , MKN1 , MKN7 , MKN45 , NCI - N87 , and SGC - 7901 ) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) and RIKEN Cell Bank . Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T was purchased from ATCC . All cell lines were cultured in RPMI - 1640 ( Gibco ) or DMEM ( Gibco ) medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and penicillin - streptomycin at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . For organoid culture , GC biopsies were collected from patients undergoing gastrectomy at Prince of Wales Hospital , Hong Kong . Cells were isolated and cultured following previously established protocol [ 17 ] . Tumor tissues ( 0 . 5 ~ 1cm 3 ) were rinsed , minced , and incubated with collagenase - accutase digestion solution for 1 h at 37 ℃ . The digestion was stopped by cold culture medium and the suspension was then filtered through a 70 µm strainer and centrifuged at 400g for 5 min . Next , the cell pellet was mixed with Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) to establish a 3D droplet culture model . After the Matrigel solidified , advanced DMEM / F12 - based culture medium was added . This study was performed with patients’ informed consent and protocol approved by the Ethics Committee as stated above . Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6511 Western blot analysis The cell and tissue samples were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Antibodies used are listed in Table S2 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) The ChIP assay was performed following the EZ - ChIP™ kit ( Merck Millipore ) instruction . MGC - 803 cells were fixed with 1 % formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then glycine was added to quench unreacted formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature . Cell pellet was resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing 1X protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) and sonicated at 4 °C to shear DNA into 200 ~ 1000 bps fragments . Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti - YAP antibody ( Cell Signaling Technology # 14074 ) and ChIP Protein A / G Magnetic Beads . The crosslink between protein and DNA was reversed at 65 °C . DNA was then purified for real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) assay . Normalization was performed to the amount of input . Primers sequences were provided in Table S3 . High - throughput virtual screening ( HTVS ) To identify potential MCM6 inhibitors , Schrödinger Maestro version 11 . 4 was used for structure based HTVS . The X - ray crystal structure of human MCM6 ( PDB ID : 6XTX ) was obtained from RCSB Protein Data Bank and further processed by the Protein Preparation Wizard module of Schrödinger . MCE Bioactive Compounds Library Plus containing 12 , 600 compounds was ready for virtual screening after conducting energy optimisation by LigPrep module of Schrödinger . These optimized compounds were then subjected to Virtual Screening Workflow for molecular docking . At first , all compounds were screened in Glide HTVS mode where the top - scored 10 % compounds were subjected to the Glide Standard Precision ( SP ) docking . Subsequently , the top 10 % from Glide SP were docked in Glide Extra Precision ( XP ) . The top 15 hit molecules with the highest absolute docking scores were selected as candidates for further experimental validation ( Table S4 ) . A higher absolute value of the predicted docking score indicates a stronger binding affinity . The 2D and 3D docking mode were created by PyMol . Cellular thermal shift assay ( CETSA ) For the cell lysate CETSA [ 18 ] , cells were harvested and washed once with PBS . The cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) and then freeze - thawed three times using liquid nitrogen for complete cell lysis . The cell lysate - containing supernatants were centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris . The lysates were diluted in PBS and divided into two subgroups : one mixed with purpureaside C ( 150 μM ) while the other mixed with empty vehicle . After a 30 - min incubation at room temperature , the lysates were aliquoted in 50 μL and each aliquot was heated to the designated temperatures for 3 min ( Applied Biosystems ) using a thermal cycler , followed by cooling for 3 min at room temperature . The heated lysates were centrifuged at 20 , 000g for 20 min at 4 °C to collect supernatants with the soluble protein fraction for subsequent western blot analysis . Drug combination analysis GC cells were treated with serial doses of 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) and purpureaside C ( under a constant combination ratio ) . CompuSyn version 1 . 0 ( https : / / www . combosyn . com / ) based on the Chou - Talalay method was used to determine the drug - drug interaction by generating the fraction affected ( Fa ) - combination index ( CI ) curves , isobolograms , and Fa - Log ( Dose reduction index [ DRI ] ) plots [ 19 , 20 ] . CI and DRI were calculated using the algorithm established by CompuSyn . For each drug combination , CI < 1 , CI = 1 , and CI > 1 indicate synergism , additive effect , and antagonism , respectively . DRI < 1 , DRI = 1 , and DRI > 1 indicate favorable dose reduction , no dose reduction , and unfavorable dose reduction , respectively . Animal studies The Yap / Taz conditional knockout ( Yap floxed / floxed Taz floxed / floxed Ubc - Cre / ERT2 ) C57BL / 6 mice were established in our previous publication [ 21 ] . To delete Yap / Taz , 6 - weeks - old Yap floxed / floxed Taz floxed / floxed Ubc - Cre / ERT2 were injected with tamoxifen ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . , three times a week ) . Four weeks after tamoxifen administration , successful Yap - / - Taz - / - mice was achieved and confirmed by PCR and western blot . To induce GC , wild - type and Yap - / - Taz - / - mice were served with MNNG - containing drinking water ( 100 mg / mL ) for 14 consecutive days followed by normal drinking water for the next 14 days [ 22 , 23 ] . After administration of MNNG for three cycles , mice were sacrificed on Day 90 for tumor collection . For subcutaneous xenografts , GC ( 2×10 6 cells ) cells were subcutaneously injected into the right dorsal flanks of 4 - weeks - old male Balb / c nude mice . Tumor size was measured every two days by a digital caliper . The mice were sacrificed 16 days after the inoculation , and tumors were harvested and weighted . To investigate the effect of MCM6 on GC metastasis in vivo , MGC - 803 ( 1×10 5 cells ) cells transduced with lentiviral carrying shNC , shMCM6 - 1 , and shMCM6 - 2 were Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6512 injected into the abdominal cavity of 4 - weeks - old male Balb / c nude mice . At the endpoint , peritoneal nodules formed were examined . For the small molecule combinational administration , 12 mice were implanted with 1×10 5 MGC - 803 cells in the abdominal cavity . After four days’ inoculation , the mice were randomly divided into four groups ( n = 3 / group ) and then treated with DMSO ( control ) , MK - 2206 2HCI ( 50 mg / kg / day by oral gavage ) , verteporfin ( 10 mg / kg by intraperitoneal injection every other day ) , or MK - 2206 2HCI plus verteporfin respectively for consecutive 24 days . For the combined effect of shMCM6 and 5 - FU , 1×10 6 cells MGC - 803 cells with or without MCM6 knockdown were injected subcutaneously into the left dorsal flank of four - week - old NSG mice . After 7 days ( tumor reaches 50 ~ 80mm 3 ) , we started to treat mice by intraperitoneal injection of 5 - FU at 25 mg / kg / every two days for 21 days . The mice were randomly separated into the following four subgroups : ( i ) PBS with shNC ( control ) ; ( ii ) PBS and shMCM6 ; ( iii ) shNC and 5 - FU ( 25 mg / kg ) ; and ( iv ) shMCM6 and 5 - FU . The mice were sacrificed on day 21 after 5 - FU treatment . The animal studies were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of CUHK ( Ref . No . 21 - 013 - NSF ) . The animal studies were conducted under the approval of the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of CUHK ( Ref . No . 21 - 013 - NSF ) . RNA sequencing Total RNA from GC cells treated as indicated were sequenced on Hiseq - PE150 ( Novogene ) . Reads were quality - checked by FastQC ( version 0 . 11 . 9 ) and mapped onto the human reference ( GRCh38 with gene annotations GENCODE version 30 ) by HISAT2 ( version 2 . 1 . 0 ) with the default options . The number of reads mapped to each of genes was counted by using featureCount ( version 1 . 6 . 4 ) . Gene expression levels were calculated as FPKM ( Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads ) by rpkm method in edgeR . Differentially expressed genes were determined using DESeq2 . Functional enrichment analysis was performed to predict the association of altered genes with disease phenotypes using WebGestalt . Please see Supplementary Materials for more detailed methods . Results MCM6 is a downstream target of YAP in GC We first verified the oncogenic potential of YAP in GC . As expected , silencing of YAP inhibited proliferation , migration , and invasion of GC cells , whereas ectopic expression of wild - type YAP or constitutively active YAP ( YAP 5SA ) exerted the opposite effect ( Figure S1A - F ) . To profile YAP target genes , four GC cell lines with or without YAP knockdown were selected for RNA - seq ( BGC - 823 , MGC - 803 , and SGC - 7901 ) and microarray ( AGS ) ( Figure 1A ) . Overlap of differential downregulated genes ( fold - change ≥ 2 ) in these GC cells identified 15 candidates targeted by YAP ( Figure 1A - B ) . Among them , MCM6 was further chosen as it was one of the top - ranked genes that exhibited significantly higher expression in GC compared with paired adjacent normal tissues from TCGA ( n = 32 , P < 0 . 001 ) . MCM6 belongs to evolutionally and functionally conserved MCM family of DNA helicase . This observation was confirmed by qPCR and western blot showing that knockdown of YAP led to a significant decrease in MCM6 mRNA and protein levels in GC cells ( Figure 1C - D ) . Moreover , overexpression of wild - type YAP or YAP 5SA increased MCM6 protein expression ( Figure 1D ) , corroborating that MCM6 is a downstream target of YAP in GC . YAP - TEAD transcriptionally induces MCM6 expression in GC The TEAD family of transcription factors is responsible for YAP - induced gene expression with a consensus binding sequence ‘GGAATG’ [ 24 ] . Analysis of MCM6 promoter region ( - 500bp , + 50bp ) by JASPAR revealed the presence of potential YAP - TEAD binding sites ( Figure 1E ) . The binding of YAP - TEAD complex to MCM6 promoter region was further confirmed in YAP - overexpressing MGC - 803 cells by ChIP - PCR assay ( Figure 1E ) . We next assessed whether the binding of YAP - TEAD complex affects MCM6 expression by constructing luciferase reporters carrying wild - type MCM6 promoter region ( WT - luc ) or a mutant variant ( Mut - luc ) ( Figure 1F ) . We found that knockdown of YAP significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of MCM6 reporter in both BGC - 823 and MGC - 803 cells , whereas no difference was detected in cells transfected with the mutant reporter ( Figure 1F ) . Consistent with these observations , pharmacological disruption of the YAP - TEAD interaction by verteporfin also suppressed YAP and MCM6 protein expression in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 1G ) . These results demonstrate that YAP induces MCM6 transcription in GC . Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6513 Figure 1 .

EV , empty vector ; NC , negative control . We next examined this regulatory relationship by analysing the association between YAP and MCM6 expression . We found YAP was positively correlated with MCM6 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in a panel of GC cell lines ( Figure 1H and Figure S2A ) . In line with this , a strong association between YAP and MCM6 expression was observed in in vivo MKN45 xenograft and MNNG - induced GC specimens ( Figure 1I - J ) . Ectopically expressed wild - type YAP or YAP 5SA significantly promoted MKN45 subcutaneous xenograft growth ( Figure 1I ) . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis revealed that MCM6 expression was strongly induced in YAP - overexpressing GC tumors together with increased proliferation marker Ki - 67 expression ( Figure 1I ) . On the other hand , knockout of Yap / Taz attenuated the inducible effect of MNNG on gastric tumorigenesis using conditional Yap / Taz knockout mice model [ 21 ] , where tumors developed on MNNG - treated Yap - / - Taz - / - mice expressed significantly less Mcm6 compared to those from WT mice ( Figure 1J ) . Furthermore , the positive association between YAP and MCM6 expression was confirmed in GC samples collected in - house by qPCR assay ( Figure 1K ) , TCGA - STAD dataset ( Figure S2B ) , as well as GC tissue microarrays from Hong Kong and Beijing cohorts by IHC staining ( Figure 1L ) . Nevertheless , knockdown of MCM6 did not alter expression of YAP and YAP target Cyr61 in GC cell lines ( Figure S2C ) , suggesting that there is no feedback loop between YAP and MCM6 in GC . Collectively , our data pinpoint MCM6 as a novel transcriptional target of YAP in GC . MCM6 is frequently overexpressed in human GC and indicates a poor prognosis We went further to characterize MCM6 expression in human GC . Using TCGA - STAD dataset , MCM6 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in GC tumors ( n = 415 ) as compared to adjacent non - tumor tissues ( n = 35 ) ( P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 2A ) . Similar trends were found in paired GC and non - tumor tissues from TCGA ( n = 32 , P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 2A ) and a publicly available dataset , GSE63089 ( n = 45 , P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 2A ) . MCM6 protein expression was also increased in GC tumors ( Figure 2B ) . Consistently , higher MCM6 expression was found in both intestinal - and diffuse - type GC tissues compared to normal gastric tissues ( Figure 2C ) , particularly within the tumor area ( Figure 2D ) by IHC staining . In contrast , MCM6 - expressing cells only existed in the isthmus of adjacent non - tumor tissue , a region enrichment of proliferating cells which were PCNA - positive ( Figure 2D and Figure S3A - C ) . Furthermore , we found MCM6 was highly expressed in eight GC cell lines ( AGS , BGC - 823 , Kato III , MGC - 803 , MKN1 , MKN7 , NCI - N87 , and SGC - 7901 ) at both mRNA and protein levels , but barely detectable in normal stomach tissues ( Figure 2E ) . MCM6 is therefore frequently upregulated in human GC . In addition , we found that GC samples harboring MCM6 copy number gain exhibited higher MCM6 mRNA expression than those with diploid MCM6 ( Figure 2F ) . A positive correlation between MCM6 copy number variation and its mRNA expression was also determined in GC samples from TCGA ( Figure 2F ) , indicating the upregulation of MCM6 may also be partially due to its copy number gain . Next , we evaluated the clinical significance of MCM6 in GC . 264 GC patients in our Hong Kong cohort were stratified into MCM6 - high and low groups . Although MCM6 protein expression was not associated with clinicopathologic features such as age , gender , Lauren subtype , tumor grade , tumor node metastasis ( TNM ) stage , and lymph node metastasis ( Table S5 ) , Kaplan – Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high - MCM6 - expressing GC ( 43 . 6 % , 115 / 264 ) survived for a significantly shortened time than those with low - MCM6 - expressing tumors ( P = 0 . 0077 ; Figure 2G ) . When subdividing patients by TNM tumor stage , high MCM6 protein expression particularly predicted poor prognosis for patients with early ( stage I and II ) GC ( P = 0 . 0076 ; Figure 2G ) . The prognostic value of MCM6 was further validated in Beijing cohort wherein high MCM6 protein expression ( 40 . 7 % , 66 / 162 ) was associated with poor disease - specific survival of GC patients ( P = 0 . 0361 ; Figure 2H ) . Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses comprising MCM6 and other risk factors such as age , Lauren subtype , tumor grade , TNM stage , and lymph node metastasis demonstrated that MCM6 was an independent prognostic factor for GC patients ( HR , 1 . 545 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 093 - 2 . 184 ; P = 0 . 014 ; Figure 2I and Table S6 ) . Therefore , MCM6 could serve as an independent poor prognostic marker for GC patients . Of note , when we stratified patients into YAP low / MCM6 low ( n = 52 ) , YAP high / MCM6 low and YAP low / MCM6 high ( n = 97 ) , and YAP high / MCM6 high ( n = 91 ) subgroups , those with both high YAP and MCM6 expression ( YAP high / Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6515 MCM6 high ) had the shortest median disease - specific survival ( 29 . 5 months , P = 0 . 0054 ; Figure 2J ) . Together , MCM6 is a poor prognostic factor for GC patients . Figure 2 . MCM6 is frequently overexpressed in human GC and indicates a poor prognosis .

Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6516 MCM6 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis in GC To investigate the biological function of MCM6 in GC , we silenced MCM6 by two independent small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) sequences in high - MCM6 - expressing BGC - 823 and MGC - 803 cells , while overexpressed MCM6 in low - MCM6 - expressing AGS cells ( Figure 2E ) . Successful knockdown and overexpression of MCM6 were confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels by qPCR and western blot , respectively ( Figure 3A and Figure S4A - B ) . We observed that silencing of MCM6 suppressed GC cell proliferation and colony formation as compared with the control ( Figure 3B - C ) . Conversely , ectopic expression of MCM6 potentiated the ability of GC cells to proliferate and form colonies ( Figure 3D - E ) . In agreement with these , reduced EdU - incorporated proliferating cells was identified upon MCM6 knockdown ( Figure 3F ) . Moreover , silencing of MCM6 led to G1 - phase cell cycle arrest and enhanced cell apoptosis ( Figure 3G - H ) ; by contrast , overexpressing MCM6 accelerated the G1 - S phase progression ( Figure 3G ) . In parallel , the protein expression of CDK6 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) was downregulated , concomitant with the upregulated p27 after MCM6 knockdown ( Figure 3I ) . On the other hand , increased expression of apoptotic markers such as cleaved - form of caspase - 7 , caspase - 9 , and PARP was observed in MCM6 - silenced GC cells ( Figure 3J ) [ 25 ] . We next examined whether MCM6 expression affected the metastatic capability of GC . Silencing of MCM6 significantly attenuated the abilities of GC cells to migrate and invade , whereas overexpressing MCM6 yielded the opposite effect ( Figure 3K - L ) . Consistently , knockdown of MCM6 increased expression of epithelial markers ( E - cadherin and claudin - 1 ) but decreased expression of mesenchymal markers ( N - cadherin and vimentin ) as determined by western blot ( Figure 3M ) . These findings collectively support that MCM6 plays an oncogenic role in GC growth and metastasis . MCM6 mediates the oncogenic potential of YAP via activating PI3K / Akt signaling To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the oncogenic function of MCM6 in GC , RNA - seq of BGC - 823 cells with or without MCM6 knockdown was conducted . Using a cut - off of ≥ 2 - fold - change and a P - value < 0 . 05 , a total of 435 differentially expressed genes ( 221 up and 214 down ) were identified upon MCM6 knockdown ( Figure 4A ) . Pathway analysis based on the database for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) identified several cancer - related pathways that were regulated by MCM6 , of which PI3K / Akt and focal adhesion signaling appeared top - ranking ( Figure 4B and Figure S5A ) . From this lead , we sought to investigate the causative relationship between MCM6 and PI3K / Akt signaling activation . By forkhead response element ( FHRE ) luciferase reporter assay [ 26 ] , PI3K / Akt pathway was significantly suppressed in MCM6 - silenced GC cells , whereas MCM6 overexpression activated PI3K / Akt activity ( Figure 4C ) . Consistently , knockdown of MCM6 reduced the phosphorylation of PI3K ( Tyr458 ) , Akt ( Ser473 ) , and glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta ( GSK3β ) ( Ser9 ) , leading to a decrease in their downstream targets including cyclin D1 and c - myc in GC cells ( Figure 4D ) . On the contrary , ectopic expression of MCM6 showed the opposite effects ( Figure 4D ) . Intriguingly , consistently higher expressions of MCM6 , p - Akt , and p - GSK3β were observed in GC samples compared to adjacent normal tissues ( Figure 4E ) . Thus , MCM6 activates PI3K / Akt pathway in GC . In light of the above findings , we hypothesized that the oncogenic function of MCM6 relies on PI3K / Akt activation . To this end , GC cells with or without MCM6 overexpression were treated with an Akt - specific inhibitor , MK - 2206 . MK - 2206 adminis - tration effectively inhibited Akt pathway ( Figure 4F and Figure S5B ) , and abolished MCM6 - induced cell proliferation and colony formation in GC cells ( Figure 4F - G ) . Given that Hippo - YAP signaling is well - documented to regulate PI3K / Akt signaling [ 27 ] , we asked whether MCM6 mediates YAP - induced Akt activation . Expectedly , knockdown of MCM6 attenuated YAP - induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β ( Figure 4H1 ) . On the contrary , ectopic expression of MCM6 in YAP - deficient BGC - 823 cells reinvigorated PI3K / Akt signaling ( Figure 4H2 ) , implying that YAP promotes PI3K / Akt signaling at least partially through MCM6 . In addition , deficiency of MCM6 completely abolished YAP - potentiated GC proliferation and metastasis ( Figure 4I - J and Figure S5C ) . Therefore , YAP - MCM6 axis promotes gastric tumorigenicity and metastasis by activating PI3K / Akt signaling . Focal adhesion pathway was also regulated by MCM6 ( Figure 4B and Figure S5A ) which is essential for cell migration and invasion [ 28 ] . By phalloidin staining , which specifically labels cytoskeletal F - actin , we found significantly fewer filopodia in MCM6 - silenced cells , in concordance with the weakened metastatic ability by MCM6 knockdown ( Figure 4K and Figure 3K - L ) . Since Cdc42 and Rac1 activation could trigger actin polymerization and filopodia formation [ 29 ] , their activities were further detected by pull - down assays . Remarkably , MCM6 knockdown suppressed active Cdc42 and Rac1 Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6517 ( Cdc42 - GTPase and Rac1 - GTPase ) expression in BGC - 823 cells ( Figure 4L ) .

Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6519 MCM6 promotes GC growth and metastasis in patient - derived organoids and xenograft models We further investigated the pro - tumorigenic effect of MCM6 ex vivo and in vivo . In patient - derived organoids , knockdown of MCM6 inhibited the growth of patient - derived organoid ( Figure 5A ) . MGC - 803 cells stably expressing shMCM6 or control cells were subcutaneously injected into the right dorsal flanks of nude mice ( Figure 5B ) . In line with in vitro findings , knockdown of MCM6 significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo ( P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 5B ) . The tumor weight of MGC - 803 - shMCM6 groups was decreased compared to the control group upon tumor harvesting ( P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 5C ) . IHC staining of MGC - 803 xenografts showed a remarkable decrease of MCM6 and PCNA ( cell proliferation marker ) expression but increase of cleaved PARP ( apoptotic marker ) expression in MGC - 803 - shMCM6 groups ( Figure 5D ) . Furthermore , the expression of p - Akt was reduced in tumors after MCM6 depletion ( Figure 5D ) , which was consistent with our in vitro observations ( Figure 4D ) , reinforcing the evidence that MCM6 promotes Akt signaling in GC . We next studied the effect of MCM6 on GC metastatic ability using the peritoneal metastasis mouse model . GC cells with or without shMCM6 were injected into the peritoneal cavity of nude mice . Results showed that knockdown of MCM6 evidently suppressed the peritoneal dissemination as exemplified by fewer tumor nodules on the peritoneal surfaces in shMCM6 groups as compared with the control group , in agreement with the MCM6 - induced epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) phenomenon ( Figure 5E and Figure 3K - M ) .

We therefore proposed that combination of YAP - MCM6 and Akt inhibition might achieve a better therapeutic effect in GC . To this end , verteporfin , a suppressor of the YAP – TEAD complex , and MK - 2206 , a highly selective inhibitor of Akt , were administrated to GC organoid and xenograft models . As shown in Figure 5F , co - treatment of verteporfin and MK - 2206 markedly reduced both organoid number and size compared to verteporfin or MK - 2206 - treated alone . In nude mice , the combination of verteporfin and MK - 2206 resulted in more significant suppression of peritoneal metastasis than single drug administration ( Figure 5G ) . Collectively , our findings demonstrated that hyperactive YAP enhances MCM6 transcription which in turn triggers the activation of PI3K / Akt signaling cascades to facilitate GC growth and metastasis . MCM6 loss sensitizes GC to genotoxic anticancer agents via ATR / Chk1 inactivation The fact that YAP confers therapy resistance in various cancer types prompted us to investigate the effect of knocking down MCM6 , a critical transcriptional target of YAP in GC , on the sensitivity of GC to chemotherapy [ 30 ] . Four FDA - approved anticancer drugs ( 5 - FU , cisplatin , oxaliplatin , and doxorubicin ) were chosen to treat three high MCM6 - expressing GC cell lines ( Figure 2E ) . We found that loss of MCM6 significantly potentiated the growth inhibitory effect of 5 - FU in GC cells as indicated by an approximately 2 - fold decrease of 48 - h half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) values ( Figure 6A and Figure S6A ) . Nevertheless , little difference was observed in GC cells treated with other drugs ( Figure S6B ) . Notably , a positive correlation between MCM6 protein expression and their corresponding IC 50 value of 5 - FU was observed in a panel of GC cell lines ( Figure 6B and Figure S6C ) , implying the potential of MCM6 as an indicator of 5 - FU therapeutic response . Moreover , silencing of MCM6 markedly caused cell proliferation arrest in GC cells upon 5 - FU treatment as evidenced by reduced EdU - positive cells ( Figure 6C ) , in agreement with the role of MCM6 in promoting GC growth ( Figure 3F ) . We next investigated the possible mechanism by which silencing of MCM6 enhances the therapeutic effect of 5 - FU on GC suppression . It is worth noting that 5 - FU acts principally by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase to reduce thymidine level for DNA replication and repair , and eventually cause DNA damage and cell death [ 31 ] . Indeed , 5 - FU treatment significantly induced DNA damage in GC cells as manifested by significantly increased tail moments in comet assays ( Figure 6D ) . Remarkably , silencing of MCM6 cooperated with 5 - FU to induce extremely high levels of DNA breaks inside GC cells ( Figure 6D ) . In response to DNA damage events , a series of DNA damage response ( DDR ) machinery is stimulated for DNA repair , allowing cells to survive and proliferate [ 32 ] . As such , phosphorylation of ATR ( Ser428 ) , ataxia - telangiectasia mutated kinase ( ATM ) ( Ser1981 ) , and Chk1 ( Ser345 ) were induced in GC cells upon 5 - FU treatment , inferring activation of ATR / Chk1 signaling ( Figure 6E ) . However , silencing of MCM6 prevented the 5 - FU induced ATR / Chk1 signaling at multiple time points ( Figure 6E ) . As a consequence , siMCM6 knockdown plus 5 - FU significantly enhanced cell apoptosis in both BGC - 823 and MGC - 803 cells compared to siMCM6 or 5 - FU treatment alone ( Figure 6F ) . On the other hand , re - expression of MCM6 restored the protein expression of p - ATR and p - Chk1 in MCM6 - deficient GC cells ( Figure 6G ) , suggesting MCM6 is required for GC cells survival in the presence of 5 - FU through activating ATR / Chk1 pathway . In line with this , GSEA analysis of our RNA - seq data revealed MCM6 expression induced ATR activation ( P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 6H ) . Intriguingly , we found YAP was capable to promote ATR / Chk1 signaling via MCM6 in GC cells under 5 - FU administration ( Figure 6I ) , corroborating that MCM6 is a critical downstream target of YAP in GC . Likewise , MCM6 loss also sensitized GC cells to UV irradiation . We found that GC cells with MCM6 knockdown became hypersensitive to UV irradiation in a time - and dose - dependent manner ( Figure 6J and Figure S6D ) , showing higher cell apoptotic rates than those exposed to UV irradiation alone ( Figure 6K and Figure S6E ) . Consistently , silencing of MCM6 remarkably diminished UV - induced phosphorylation of ATR and Chk1 at different time points ( Figure 6L ) . Collectively , our findings demonstrated that depletion of MCM6 sensitized GC cells to genotoxic anticancer agents by triggering DNA damage while compromising DNA repair through suppressing ATR / Chk1 checkpoint pathway , thus resulting in the massive accumulation of damaged DNA and consequent cell death . We next evaluated the anti - tumor effect of the 5 - FU plus shMCM6 in MGC - 803 xenografts ( Figure 6M ) . We found that shMCM6 or 5 - FU treatment alone significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to the control group , whilst their combination resulted in maximal tumor suppression in GC xenografts ( Figure 6N - O ) . Consistently , the lowest tumor weight was observed in the combination group ( Figure 6O ) . All these data underscore the potential of MCM6 as a therapeutic target for GC . Thus , depletion of MCM6 potentiates the efficacy of chemotherapy in GC . Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6521 Figure 6 .

MCM6 inhibitor purpureaside C exhibits a strong growth inhibitory effect on GC Currently , there are no commercially available MCM6 inhibitors . Therefore , we conducted a structure - based high - throughput virtual screening ( HTVS ) of 12 , 600 compounds in search of potential MCM6 inhibitors ( Figure 7A ) . Upon sequential SP and XP docking analyses , fifteen compounds with the top - ranked docking scores were selected for further experimental validation ( Figure 7A - B and Table S4 ) . Among them , purpureaside C showed the strongest inhibitory effect on MCM6 protein expression . In silico docking revealed that purpureaside C binds to the ATP - pocket of MCM6 protein through the seven hydrogen bonds ( H - bonds ) formed with Asp545 , Asp538 , Thr357 , His359 , and His556 ( Figure 7C ) . Western blot indicated that purpureaside C significantly suppressed MCM6 protein expression in GC cells in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 7D ) . As expected , purpureaside C exhibited remarkable inhibitory effects on BGC - 823 , MGC - 803 and SGC - 7901 cells as exemplified by markedly reduced cell viability and colony - forming capacity ( Figure 7E - F ) . We further performed CETSA to determine the interaction between purpureaside C and MCM6 protein . We found that purpureaside C led to substantial shifts of the thermal stability of MCM6 in both MGC - 803 and SGC - 7901 ( Figure 7G ) , confirming their direct interaction . We next asked whether inhibition of MCM6 by purpureaside C could also potentiate the anti - tumor effect of 5 - FU in GC . Likewise , the combination of purpureaside C and 5 - FU exhibited a synergistic effect against GC growth with the CI values less than 1 in two different GC cell lines ( Figure 7H ) . Moreover , their DRI values were more than 1 ( Figure 7I ) , suggesting favorable dose - reduction for each drug in the combination . In line with these , purpureaside C plus 5 - FU resulted in the highest percentage of GC cell apoptosis ( Figure 7J ) . Nevertheless , we observed no synergy of purpureaside C and VP in GC ( Figure S7A - B ) . Discussion Exploiting novel cancer therapies is urgent considering a lack of effective treatment options and unsatisfactory clinical benefits for advanced GC patients . Our previous study has pinpointed that aberrant activation of YAP plays a pivotal role in GC progression [ 7 ] . Here , we further demonstrate for the first time that MCM6 is a critical transcriptional target of Hippo - YAP signaling in GC which mediates the YAP - driven gastric malignancy . MCM6 , a DNA helicase that belongs to the highly conserved MCM family , has been implicated in the initiation and elongation of DNA replication [ 8 ] . We show that YAP binds to the ‘GGAATG’ motif in the MCM6 promoter region and activates MCM6 transcription . Indeed , a strong positive correlation between YAP and MCM6 expression was observed in a panel of GC cell lines , different GC mice models , and human GC samples , corroborating that MCM6 is a direct downstream target of YAP in GC . Consistent with our findings , the role of YAP / TEAD2 complex in driving MCM6 expression at the transcriptional level was depicted in pancreatic cancer [ 33 ] . However , no feedback loop between YAP and MCM6 was observed in our study . Intriguingly , a recent publication demonstrated that tumor suppressor CDK5RAP3 may interact with MCM6 to prevent its nuclear translocation of in GC [ 9 ] . However , our study reveals that MCM6 is predominantly expressed in the nucleus , which is also supported by other publication [ 34 ] . Thus , the regulatory role of CDK5RAP3 for MCM6 translocation may be context dependent which should be clarified in future . MCM6 expression is significantly higher in GC tumors compared with non - tumor tissues and predicts poor survival in GC patients in our study , which is same as YAP [ 7 ] , alluding to the possibility that MCM6 plays an oncogenic role in GC . This is corroborated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments . We found that MCM6 promoted GC cell cycle progression , concomitant with increased expression of cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 , CDK6 , and PCNA . On the other hand , knockdown of MCM6 induced GC cell apoptosis as exemplified by induction of caspase cascades . Apart from promoting GC proliferation , MCM6 also contributed to the metastatic ability of GC by augmenting the ability of cells to migrate and invade . Knockdown of MCM6 induced epithelial markers expression , e . g . , E - cadherin and claudin - 1 , but inhibited mesenchymal markers expression , e . g . , N - cadherin and vimentin . These EMT markers have been well - known to regulate migratory and invasive properties of cancer cells [ 35 ] . In agreement with our finding , MCM6 has been reported to exert oncogenic functions in liver , breast , and brain cancers [ 10 ] . Together , MCM6 promotes GC growth and metastasis .

Systematic transcriptome analyses of GC cells revealed that PI3K / Akt signaling pathway was highly associated with MCM6 . Accordingly , silencing of MCM6 inhibited PI3K / Akt signaling as evidenced by decreased p - PI3K , p - Akt , and p - GSK3β expression . MCM6 expression was also closely associated with Akt activity in paired GC tissues . Akt acts as a core component of PI3K / Akt signaling cascade which is responsible for coordinating cell response to extrinsic stimuli and contributes to cancer cell proliferation and survival [ 36 - 41 ] . Activated Akt prevents cyclin D1 and c - myc from GSK3β - mediated degradation , thereby promoting cell proliferation but inhibiting apoptosis [ 36 - 41 ] . All of these are in concordant with the malignant phenotypes driven by MCM6 . We showed that blockade of Akt signaling using MK - 2206 abrogated the MCM6 - driven GC tumorigenicity and metastasis , suggesting that MCM6 exerts its oncogenic functions through activating PI3K / Akt in GC . Notably , YAP is well - documented to regulate PI3K / Akt signaling inside tumors [ 42 , 43 ] . However , YAP failed to induce PI3K / Akt and subsequent cell proliferation and metastasis in MCM6 - deficient GC cells , implying that YAP potentiates PI3K / Akt - mediated GC development at least in part through MCM6 . In addition to PI3K / Akt pathway , MCM6 also phenocopies the promoting effect of YAP on F - actin polymerization and GC metastasis . Hyper - activated YAP has been reported to upregulate F - actin polymerization and subsequent filopodia formation by controlling Cdc42 activity [ 28 , 29 , 44 , 45 ] . In agreement , depletion of MCM6 suppresses Cdc42 and Rac1 to impair the formation of invasive protrusion filopodia . Thus , YAP may induce MCM6 - Cdc42 / Rac1 axis to promote F - actin polymerization , thereby accelerating GC metastasis . GC patients suffer from poor survival because of the limited therapeutic efficacy . Chemo - and radiotherapy are two available options for advanced GC ; however , the survival benefit derived from these treatments is modest due to the emerged resistance . Identification of treatment strategies for improving GC therapy response is therefore urgent and important . Although chemo - or radiotherapy exerts cancer - killing effects by inducing DNA damage , DDR signaling is simultaneously stimulated to coordinate DNA repair process for survival [ 46 ] . GC resistance to chem - or radiotherapy could be attributed to the activation of DDR pathways [ 47 ] . The fact that cancer cells with defects in DNA repair are more susceptible to exogenous DNA - targeting agents prompts a strategy of targeting DDR for GC patients who are unresponsive to chemo - or radiotherapy . Our work here revealed that silencing of MCM6 strongly suppressed ATR / Chk1 signaling , a primary direct effector of DNA damage and responsible for cell survival in GC cells upon 5 - FU treatment or UV exposure [ 48 ] . As such , MCM6 depletion together with DNA - damaging agents exacerbated the accumulation of damaged DNA , which further led to massive cancer cell death and tumor regression . On the other hand , re - expression of MCM6 restored ATR / Chk1 signaling in MCM6 - deficient GC cells . Therefore , MCM6 is required for the activation of DDR signaling in response to genotoxic anticancer agents . In line with our findings , ATR pathway was activated in several cancers [ 49 ] , and loss of ATR function could improve cancer response to 5 - FU [ 50 ] . Moreover , we discovered purpureaside C as a poten - tial MCM6 inhibitor , which could directly interact with MCM6 protein to suppress its expression . Strikingly , administration of purpureaside C with 5 - FU synergistically suppressed GC growth and induced cell death . Thus , MCM6 is a potential therapeutic target in GC . To understand how MCM6 activates PI3K / Akt / GSK3β signaling and ATR / Chk1 - mediated DNA damage response , we conducted in silico protein interaction analysis using the BioGRID data repository ( https : / / thebiogrid . org / ) . A total of 42 protein are uncovered which exhibit physical interactions with MCM6 including MCM2 - 7 complex subunits ( MCM2 - 5 and 7 ) and MCM - binding protein ( MCMBP ) ( Table S7 ) . Among them , SSRP1 , a subunit of facilitates chromatin transcription ( FACT ) complex , is required for the activation of ATR / Chk1 in response to replication stress [ 51 ] . In addition , USP7 could facilitate Chk1 protein stability by direct deubiquitination , thereby elevating Chk1 levels [ 52 ] . Furthermore , SSRP1 and USP7 have been identified to promote PI3K / Akt signaling pathway [ 53 , 54 ] . Therefore , MCM6 may bind to SSRP1 and USP7 in the nucleus to activate PI3K / Akt and ATR / Chk1 signaling pathways . Nevertheless , further studies are warranted to prove this hypothesis . In conclusion , our study uncovers MCM6 as a novel and critical downstream target of YAP in GC . YAP binds to MCM6 promoter to induce its transcription and subsequent PI3K / Akt / GSK3β activation , thus leading to accelerated GC growth and metastasis . Targeting MCM6 by MCM6 - siRNA or purpureaside C , our newly identified MCM6 Theranostics 2022 , Vol . 12 , Issue 15 https : / / www . thno . org 6525 inhibitor , sensitizes GC cells to genotoxic antitumor agents via suppression of DDR .
