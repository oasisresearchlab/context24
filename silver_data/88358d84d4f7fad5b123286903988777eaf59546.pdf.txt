Whereas several proteins cap the rapidly growing barbed end , tropomodulin ( Tmod ) is the only protein known to cap the slowly growing pointed end . The lack of structural information severely limits our understanding of Tmod ’ s capping mechanism . We describe crystal structures of actin complexes with the unstructured amino - terminal and the leucine - rich repeat carboxy - terminal domains of Tmod . The structures and biochemical analysis of structure - inspired mutants showed that one Tmod molecule interacts with three actin subunits at the pointed end , while also contacting two tropomyosin molecules on each side of the filament . We found that Tmod achieves high - affinity binding through several discrete low - affinity interactions , which suggests a mechanism for controlled subunit exchange at the pointed end . T he proteins that cap the ends of the actin filament play important roles in actin - driven processes such as cell migration and or - ganelle trafficking by controlling the ad - dition and dissociation of actin subunits at filament ends . Several proteins cap the barbed end of the filament , including capping protein ( CP ) and some gelsolin - family members ( 1 , 2 ) . In contrast , tropomodulin ( Tmod ) is the only protein known to cap the pointed end of tropo - myosin ( TM ) – coated actin filaments ( 3 ) . Four Tmod isoforms work in conjunction with one of several TM isoforms to stabilize actin struc - tures characterized by a uniform distribution of the lengths of actin filaments . These struc - tures include the sarcomere of cardiac and skel - etal muscle cells and the spectrin - based membrane skeleton ( 3 , 4 ) . The mechanism by which Tmod caps the pointed end is poorly understood . Quantification in skeletal muscle and erythrocytes led to the pro - posal that two Tmod molecules cap the pointed end ( 5 , 6 ) . In vitro , however , one Tmod molecule is sufficient to block pointed - end elongation of TM - coated filaments ( 7 ) , consistent with the dis - tinctive domain architecture of Tmod , which har - bors two actin - and two TM - binding sites . Thus , the N - terminal ~ 160 – amino acid region is mostly unstructured in isolation ( 8 ) , but contains three predicted helical segments that bind TM , actin , and TM in that order ( 9 , 10 ) . This region displays TM - dependent capping activity ( 9 ) . Most of the C - terminal region ( human Tmod1 residues 161 to 359 ) consists of a leucine - rich repeat ( LRR ) domain ( 11 ) . This region displays limited cap - ping activity on its own ( 9 ) . Although Tmod binds with nanomolar affinity to the pointed end ( 12 ) , and even greater affinity in the presence of TM ( 7 ) , it does not form an absolute cap . Instead , Tmod functions as a “ leaky ” cap , determining the length of the actin filaments while allow - ing for the controlled addition or dissociation of actin subunits at the pointed end ( 13 ) . In the absence of high - resolution structures of the pointed end , rationalization of the existing data is difficult , and several models exist , featuring either one ( 10 , 11 ) or two ( 5 , 6 ) Tmod molecules at the pointed end . Actin polymerization prevents crystallization of capping complexes . We thus attempted crystal - lization of the N - and C - terminal actin - binding sites ( ABS1 and ABS2 ) of Tmod in complex with monomeric actin . However , both sites bound with weak affinity to monomeric actin ( see be - low ) , and polymerization persisted during crys - tallization . A solution was found by fusing ABS1 and ABS2 C - terminally to gelsolin segment 1 ( GS1 ) via a nine – amino acid flexible linker [ crystalliza - tion strategies are described in ( 14 ) ] . The Tmod fragments extended beyond the actin - binding sites defined previously ( 9 , 15 – 17 ) , with ABS1 and ABS2 comprising human Tmod1 residues 50 to 101 and 160 to 349 , respectively ( Fig . 1A ) . No - tably , ABS1 and ABS2 both bound actin : GS1 with 1 : 1 stoichiometry and with similar affinities [ dis - sociation constant ( K D ) = 7 . 5 and 10 . 5 m M for ABS1 and ABS2 , respectively ] when not connected by a linker ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . Similar binding affinities were obtained at two different tem - peratures , 10°C and 20°C , and with adenosine 5´ - triphosphate ( ATP ) – or adenosine5´ - diphosphate ( ADP ) – actin ( fig . S1 ) . The complexes of ATP - actin with GS1 - ABS1 and GS1 - ABS2 crystallized under slightly dif - ferent conditions , and with different unit cell parameters ( 14 ) ( table S1 ) . The structures were determined to 1 . 8 and 2 . 3 Å resolution for ABS1 and ABS2 , respectively ( Fig . 1 , D and E , and fig . S2 , A and B ) . Both structures were well defined in the electron density maps ( fig . S2 , C and D ) . The flexible linkers between GS1 and the Tmod fragments , and residues 50 to 57 and 100 to 101 of ABS1 and 160 to 169 of ABS2 , were not vi - sualized . These residues likely do not interact with actin , because the C termini of ABS1 and ABS2 projected away from actin , and weak elec - tron density that could not be modeled was also observed projecting away from actin at their N termini . A structure of ABS1 was also obtained with ADP - actin at 2 . 15 Å resolution and showed a conformation similar to that observed with ATP - actin ( 14 ) . Crystals of ABS2 could not be obtained with ADP - actin . The Tmod structures differed substantially from previously characterized actin complexes ( 18 ) ; whereas most actin - binding proteins bind in the cleft between actin subdomains 1 and 3 , ABS1 and ABS2 bound at the pointed end of the actin monomer , and on the side of subdomains SCIENCE sciencemag . org 25 JULY 2014 (cid:127) VOL 345 ISSUE 6195 463 Department of Physiology , Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA 19104 , USA . * Corresponding author : E - mail : droberto @ mail . med . upenn . edu RESEARCH | REPORTS 2 and 1 ( Fig . 1 , D and E , and movies S1 and S2 ) . An unusual feature of the structures was an in - teraction with the deoxyribonuclease I ( DNase I ) – binding loop in actin . As a result , this loop , which is disordered in most actin structures , was or - dered in the Tmod complexes , albeit with differ - ent conformations in the two structures . ABS1 extended beyond the a helix suggested previously , with a total of 42 residues ( P58 to K99 ) mediating the interaction ( Fig . 1 , A and D ) . ABS1 adopted a rather extended conformation and contacted three out of the four actin sub - domains . The a helix was longer than anticipated , comprising residues 64 to 77 . This helix played a crucial role in the interaction , by forming a bridge across the nucleotide - binding cleft on top of actin subdomains 4 and 2 . As a result , the nucleotide cleft was slightly more closed in this structure than in that of ABS2 . The interactions of ABS2 were also more ex - tensive than anticipated and involved contacts along the entire region Y170 to L344 . Residues Y170 to N179 formed a loop that interacted with the DNase I – binding loop in actin . Several addi - tional contacts were mediated by the LRR domain , whose boundaries differed compared to the de - scription of the structure of uncomplexed chicken Tmod1 residues 179 to 344 ( 11 ) . The LRR motif is defined as a b - strand – loop – a - helix module ( 19 ) . The loop of the motif is called the “ ascending loop , ” whereas the loop connecting one motif to the next is called the “ descending loop . ” By this criterion , Tmod contains not five but four - and - a - half LRR motifs ( Fig . 1A ) . The ascending loops typically mediate protein - protein interactions ( 19 ) , and this principle was conserved in Tmod , where the ascending loops interacted on the back side ( according to the classical view ) of actin subdo - mains 2 and 1 ( Fig . 1 A and E ) . Most LRR do - mains have N - and C - terminal caps , which shield the hydrophobic core of the domain from solvent exposure ( 19 ) . In Tmod , these caps consisted of a helices that ran diagonally to the first and last LRR motifs : D182 to N193 and Q321 to N336 . The C - terminal cap continued as an uninterrupted a 464 25 JULY 2014 (cid:127) VOL 345 ISSUE 6195 sciencemag . org SCIENCE P58 - K99 R325 - L344 Y170 - N179 N201 - R206 V232 - R235 N258 - F263 K286 - S291 K314 - H318 Leucine rich repeats within LRR domain Fragments co - crystallized with actin N - and C - terminal helical caps of LRR domain Helical segment within actin - binding site 1 TM - binding sites .

This helix interacted along most of its length ( R325 to L344 ) with actin subdomain 1 . The structures of ABS1 and ABS2 were un - equivocally overlaid onto the pointed end of the actin filament ( 20 ) , producing a model of the pointed end that was then tested by mutagen - esis ( 14 ) . First , the structures showed that Tmod could only bind at the pointed end , because both ABS1 and ABS2 covered surfaces that are buried in the filament . Second , ABS1 and ABS2 must bind to two different protomers at the pointed end , because their binding surfaces par - tially overlapped ( fig . S3A ) . Third , the binding surfaces of ABS1 and ABS2 also overlapped when they were superimposed onto the second and first protomers of the filament , respectively ( fig . S3B ) . This arrangement also placed the two actin - binding sites asymmetrically on one side of the filament , increasing the distance that must be covered by the intervening sequence ( residues 100 to 170 ) that contains the second TM - binding site . In contrast , no overlap was observed when ABS1 and ABS2 were superim - posed onto the first and second protomers of the filament , respectively ( Fig . 2A ) . This arrange - ment naturally positioned ABS2 at the interface between the first three subunits of the filament , where Tmod residues in contact with actin were highly conserved ( fig . S4A ) .

( C ) Normalized pointed - end elongation rates of filament seeds as a function of mutant Tmod concentration , and in the presence of TM ( the individual titrations are shown in fig . S7 ) . Each mutant is represented by a different color ( keys are given on the bottom ) . ( D ) Comparison of the normalized pointed - end elongation rates at 200 nM Tmod with or without ( gray bars ) TM . RESEARCH | REPORTS especially the location of the N termini of ABS1 and ABS2 , was further consistent with the azi - muthal sliding of TM on the surface of the filament ( fig . S5 ) , which occurs upon Ca 2 + bind - ing to troponin and myosin binding to the fila - ment ( 21 ) . The two extreme positions of TM on the filament , blocked and open , are represented by electron microscopy ( EM ) structures of actin - TM ( 22 ) and actin - TM - myosin ( 23 ) . The full extent of TM ’ s sliding is estimated to be ~ 35° ( 21 ) , which greatly restricts the available surface for Tmod binding at the pointed end and strong - ly supports the model proposed here . Key interactions of Tmod with the first three protomers of the filament ( Fig . 2A and fig . S4 ) were tested by mutagenesis and pointed end – capping assays . In these assays , the barbed end must be tightly capped , because faster dy - namics at this end can mask subunit exchange at the pointed end . Traditionally , gelsolin has been used to cap the barbed end in Tmod studies ( 7 , 10 , 12 , 15 – 17 ) . We found , however , that CP and not gelsolin should be used in these assays ( fig . S6 , A to D ) , because monomer sequestration and filament severing by gelsolin interfered with its barbed end capping activity ( 14 ) . The optimal concentration of TM for our ex - periments was 1 m M ( 14 ) ( fig . S6 , E to H ) . Thus , the concentration dependence of Tmod capping was determined in the absence or the presence of 1 m M TM ( Fig . 2B and fig . S7 , A and B ) . TM enhanced Tmod ’ s capping efficiency about four - fold , resulting in a K D of 28 nM compared to 108 nM in the absence of TM . These affinity values could be directly compared , because the same stock of filament seeds was used in the ex - periments . Generally , however , the affinity values depend on the number of pointed ends , which varies from experiment to experiment . Although substantial , a ~ 4 - fold increase in affinity was far below the 1000 - fold increase and picomolar af - finity reported previously ( 7 ) , which prompted several repetitions of the experiments with iden - tical results . A nanomolar rather than picomolar affinity of Tmod at the pointed end seems more consistent with the observation of pointed - end monomer exchange in sarcomeres ( 13 ) . We analyzed eight Tmod mutants in elongation assays ( Fig . 2 , figs . S4 and S7 , and movie S3 ) . Erythrocytes express a short Tmod isoform ( res - idues 103 to 359 ) ( 24 ) , which reinforces an idea suggested by the structures ; Tmod is better de - scribed as consisting of two TM - actin – binding modules . Thus , we expressed constructs 1 to 101 and 100 to 359 to test the importance of each module . Other mutations were introduced within full - length Tmod and targeted the a helix and tail region of ABS1 , and interactions of ABS2 with the first three protomers of the filament . Although TM increased the capping efficiency of the mutants , they all displayed reduced ac - tivity compared to wild - type Tmod , supporting the importance of these residues for Tmod - actin interactions ( Fig . 2 , C and D , and fig . S7 , C to J ) . The most severe capping defects were observed with the deletion or mutations of the C - terminal TM - actin – binding module . Particularly , replac - ing residues 322 to 325 at the beginning of the C - terminal a helix with AAAA or EEEE had the most pronounced effect , consistent with the key location of this region at the interface between the first three protomers of the filament . Muta - tions reported to affect actin binding and capping ( 9 , 15 – 17 ) also tended to localize to the contact surface with subunits of the filament ( Fig . 2A , fig . S4 , and movie S3 ) . These results are consistent with a model in which a single Tmod molecule caps actin filaments 466 25 JULY 2014 (cid:127) VOL 345 ISSUE 6195 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Fig . 3 . Model of the pointed end . ( A ) Domain diagram of Tmod ( according to Fig . 1A ) , showing a secondary - structure prediction of the N - terminal region by several algorithms ( 14 ) . The prediction suggests that the two TM - binding sites , which are similar in size , also share a similar fold , consisting of a three - helix bundle . ( B ) Model of the pointed end , with the structures of the com - plexes of actin with ABS1 and ABS2 ( magenta ) superimposed onto the first two protomers of the filament ( marine and blue ) . ABS2 also contacts the third protomer ( purple - colored area ) . TM is shown in the stable “ blocked ” position , which it assumes when bound alone to the filament ( 22 ) . A tentative model of the two TM - binding sites of Tmod ( green ) , based on the results of the secondary - structure prediction and energy minimization ( 14 ) , is shown for reference ( see also movie S4 ) . RESEARCH | REPORTS at the pointed end ( Fig . 3 and movie S4 ) . ABS1 interacts only with the first protomer of the filament ( interface area : 1549 Å 2 ) and ABS2 inter - acts mainly with the second protomer ( interface area : 1770 Å 2 ) , although it also contacts proto - mers 1 and 3 ( estimated interface areas : 198 and 125 Å 2 , respectively ) . Secondary - structure predic - tion using several algorithms further suggests that the two TM - binding sites have a related fold con - sisting of three helices ( 14 ) . The model of the pointed end proposed here is supported by ana - lysis of several Tmod mutants and by steric con - straints imposed by the structure of the filament ( 20 ) and the blocked ( 22 ) and open ( 23 ) positions of TM on the filament . The structure of the pointed end – binding VCD domain of Vibrio VopL was recently de - termined in complex with an actin trimer ( 25 ) . One of the subunits of the VCD dimer binds in the same location as ABS2 , i . e . , at the interface between the first three subunits of the filament ( fig . S8 ) . VopL is a powerful nucleator , and this activity is strongly enhanced by the presence of actin monomer – binding WH2 domains N - terminal to VCD ( 26 , 27 ) . Similarly , the Tmod - relatedproteinleiomodinisapowerfulnucleator ( 28 ) , and this activity is enhanced by the presence of a C - terminal tail that contains a WH2 domain . Separately , ABS1andABS2interactwithmono - meric actin with K D s of ~ 10 m M , independent of the nucleotide state on actin , whereas full - length Tmod binds to the pointed end with a K D of 108 nM , and 28 nM in the presence of TM . Thus , the increased affinity of Tmod at the pointed end results from multiple , relatively weak interactions , involving three actin proto - mers and two TM molecules on each side of the filament . We suggest that Tmod ’ s interac - tions at the pointed end are better described in the form of two TM - actin – binding modules . Because of their relative independence and weaker individual affinities , one module can detach from the filament while the other re - mains bound , which could explain pointed - end subunit exchange in sarcomeres ( 13 ) . Newly in - corporated monomers likely consist of ATP - actin , for which the two actin - binding sites of Tmod appear to have an affinity similar to that for ADP - actin , thought to be the predominant species at the pointed end .
