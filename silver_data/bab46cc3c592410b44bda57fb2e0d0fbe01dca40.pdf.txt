Abstract : Delivery of siRNAs for the treatment of tumors critically depends on the development of efﬁcient nucleic acid carrier systems . The complexation of dendritic polymers ( dendrimers ) results in nanoparticles , called dendriplexes , that protect siRNA from degradation and mediate non - speciﬁc cellular uptake of siRNA . However , large siRNA doses are required for in vivo use due to accumula - tion of the nanoparticles in sinks such as the lung , liver , and spleen . This suggests the exploration of targeted nanoparticles for enhancing tumor cell speciﬁcity and achieving higher siRNA levels in tumors . In this work , we report on the targeted delivery of a therapeutic siRNA speciﬁc for BIRC5 / Survivin in vitro and in vivo to tumor cells expressing the surface marker prostate stem cell antigen ( PSCA ) . For this , polyplexes consisting of single - chain antibody fragments speciﬁc for PSCA conjugated to siRNA / maltose - modiﬁed poly ( propylene imine ) dendriplexes were used . These polyplexes were endocytosed by PSCA - positive 293T PSCA / ffLuc and PC3 PSCA cells and caused knockdown of reporter gene ﬁreﬂy luciferase and Survivin expression , respectively . In a therapeutic study in PC3 PSCA xenograft - bearing mice , signiﬁcant anti - tumor effects were observed upon systemic administration of the targeted polyplexes . This indicates superior anti - tumor efﬁcacy when employ - ing targeted delivery of Survivin - speciﬁc siRNA , based on the additive effects of siRNA - mediated Survivin knockdown in combination with scFv - mediated PSCA inhibition . Keywords : targeted siRNA delivery ; maltose - modiﬁed poly ( propylene imine ) ; Survivin ; prostate stem cell antigen 1 . Introduction Small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) can selectively target and downregulate tumor - relevant genes , holding great promise in cancer treatment . The siRNA - mediated silencing ( RNAi ) of genes utilizes a conserved biological process among multicellular organisms that mediates resistance to both endogenous parasitic and exogenous pathogenic nucleic acids , and regulates the expression of protein - coding genes . It relies on 21 bp to 23 bp double - stranded , so - called small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) , whose guide strand is integrated into the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) , which , upon sequence - speciﬁc binding , Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / pharmaceutics13050676 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / pharmaceutics Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 2 of 15 promotes the destruction of target mRNAs through an enzymatic activity integrated in the complex [ 1 ] . Importantly , the destruction of a speciﬁc cellular mRNA can also be achieved by transfection of chemically synthesized siRNA molecules , which then enter the RNAi pathway . The silencing by siRNA is highly efﬁcient due to RISC - mediated protection of the guide strand from degradation and its catalytic activity , leading to the cleavage of many mRNA molecules [ 2 ] . SiRNA molecules are prone to degradation by serum nucleases , cannot easily cross membranes due to their size and negative net charge , and are subject to renal elimination . Therefore , in addition to chemical modiﬁcation of siRNA [ 3 ] , carrier systems have been established to increase siRNA half - life and transfection of cells [ 4 ] . Among non - viral sys - tems for delivery of siRNA for cancer treatment ( for review , see [ 5 ] ) , polymeric carrier molecules such as dendritic polymers poly ( amidoamine ) ( PAMAM ) and poly ( propylene imine ) ( PPI ) have emerged as suitable siRNA carriers [ 4 , 6 ] . Due to their cationic net charge , such polymeric carriers are capable of complexing negatively charged siRNA resulting in nanoparticles called dendriplexes . Tuning of polymeric carriers by surface modiﬁcations with sugars or poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) is essential to reduce their cytotoxicity and to inhibit intermolecular aggregation of generated dendriplexes . Most importantly , such mod - iﬁcations provide a hydrophilic shell which reduces interaction with the reticuloendothelial system and therefore improve the circulation time in the bloodstream [ 7 ] . However , when considering PEG - modiﬁed carrier molecules for repeated delivery of siRNA , there is accumulating evidence of pre - existing as well as treatment - induced anti - PEG antibody responses . Several reports correlated the generation of anti - PEG antibodies with loss of therapeutic efﬁcacy and described adverse effects after repeated administrations of PEGylated proteins , peptides and carrier molecules ( for review , see [ 8 ] ) . Therefore , we have previously focused on sugar modiﬁcations , in particular maltose - modiﬁcation of poly ( ethylene imine ) ( PEI ) and PPI carrier molecules as alternative for PEGylation [ 9 ] . Decreased positive net charges of dendriplexes upon more extensive sugar modiﬁcation of the polymeric carriers , however , can also lead to a stealth - like mode , characterized by impaired cell membrane interaction and thus reduced siRNA delivery into cells [ 10 ] . On the other hand , this decrease in non - speciﬁc uptake efﬁcacy provides the basis for targeted , ligand - mediated delivery and uptake . We recently described transfection - disabled maltose - modiﬁed PPI dendrimers ( mPPI ) , which , upon coupling of antibodies for targeting , became competent for delivering siRNA to target cells expressing the cognate antigen / receptor . More speciﬁcally , we successfully developed a modular so - called polyplex system based on m - PPIs , neutravidin and bioconjugated mono - biotinylated single - chain antibodies ( scFv ) for targeted delivery of siRNA to EGFRvIII - positive tumors [ 10 ] . In the current study , we explore for the ﬁrst time the targeted delivery of a therapeutic siRNA , namely Survivin - siRNA ( siSurv ) , using an mPPI - based polyplex system with scFv - mediated targeting of PSCA , for treatment of PSCA - positive target cells and tumors . Survivin belongs to the inhibitor of the apoptosis protein ( IAP ) family and is highly expressed in cancer tissues and cancer cell lines [ 11 ] . The anti - apoptotic activity of Survivin is achieved by reducing caspase activity . In particular , in cancer cells , Survivin sequesters the apoptosis - inducing factor Smac / DIABLO away from binding to the X - linked inhibitor of apoptosis ( XIAP ) , which inhibits induction of intrinsic apoptosis by blocking Caspase 9 activation [ 12 ] . Furthermore , Survivin plays an additional and unique role in the regula - tion of mitotic events . It has been shown that chromosome segregation and cytokinesis essentially depend on Survivin [ 13 , 14 ] . Its functional relevance in the tumor and the fact that a disruption of the genetic Survivin locus cannot be compensated by other members of the IAP family [ 15 ] make Survivin a particularly attractive therapeutic RNAi target . PSCA represents an associated glycophosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored cell sur - face antigen [ 16 – 19 ] , which is expressed in normal prostate - speciﬁc tissue and overex - pressed in prostate cancer specimens including both high - grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and androgen - dependent / independent tumors [ 19 ] . PSCA is also expressed in prostate cancer metastases [ 20 ] and in prostate - unrelated carcinomas such as pancre - Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 3 of 15 atic adenocarcinoma [ 21 ] , renal clear - cell carcinoma [ 22 ] , transitional cell carcinoma [ 23 ] , and glioblastoma [ 24 ] . Recently , we demonstrated successful delivery of TLR3 agonist Riboxxol - biotin conjugated to neutravidin / anti - PSCA exclusively to PSCA - positive target cells in vitro and in vivo [ 25 ] . We therefore considered PSCA as a relevant tumor - associated antigen which is a targetable structure for employing our polyplex approach for delivery of therapeutic siRNA . In this study , we therefore investigate a novel polyplex system based on the combi - nation of targeted delivery of therapeutic siRNA , siRNA - mediated Survivin knockdown and scFv - mediated PSCA inhibition . To speciﬁcally distinguish the extent to which each component contributes to the targeted siSurv delivery mediated by the PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes , the in vivo anti - tumor effects were directly compared to those obtained with PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes loaded with control siRNA ( scFv - mediated PSCA inhibition only ) and polyplexes loaded with siSurv but conjugated with a non - speciﬁc control an - tibody ( Survivin knockdown only ) [ 26 ] . Indeed , we found that the anti - tumor effects of the PSCA - targeted , siSurv - containing polyplexes signiﬁcantly exceeded the anti - tumor effects of the single - component systems . Thus , the mPPI - based PSCA - targeted polyplexes provide an innovative platform for further exploration of targeted delivery of siRNAs and other nucleic acids for therapeutic application . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Synthesis of PPIs Transfection - disabled maltose - modiﬁed PPI dendrimers ( mPPI = mal19 - PPI ) and biotinylated mPPIs were synthesized and characterized as described previously [ 10 ] . Here , maltose - ( mal ) - modiﬁed fourth - generation PPI dendrimers ( mal - PPI ) were used with 19 % ( mal19 - PPI ) being modiﬁed ( 14 , 900 g / mol ; modiﬁed with 24 maltose units per molecule ) . 2 . 2 . Cell Lines The human embryonic kidney cell lines 293T , 293T huBirA , 293T huBirA - scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP and 293T PSCA , the human HEK - Blue hTLR3 / PSCA SEAP reporter cell line as well as the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and PC3 PSCA have been described previously [ 10 , 25 , 27 ] . The 293T PSCA / ffLuc cell line with ectopic expression of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase was generated by lentiviral transduction of 293T PSCA cells using pHATtrick - ffLuc - Puro vector . Packaging of viral particles and transduction were performed using a three - vector system described previously [ 28 ] . Transduced cells were selected with 20 µ g / mL puromycin for 72 h . PC3 cell lines were maintained in RPMI - 1640 completed with 10 % v / v heat - inactivated FCS , 2 mM L glutamine , 100 µ g / mL streptomycin , 100 U / mL penicillin , and 10 mM HEPES ( all from Life Technologies ) . 293T and 293T PSCA cell lines were cultured in DMEM completed with 4 . 5 g / L glucose , 10 % v / v heat - inactivated FCS , 100 U / mL penicillin , 100 µ g / mL strep - tomycin and 10 mM HEPES ( all from Life Technologies ) . 293T huBirA - scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP and 293T huBirA cells were maintained in DMEM complete supplemented with 50 µ M Biotin - C6 ( Sigma - Aldrich , Darmstadt , Germany ) for scFv production . Human HEK - Blue hTLR3 / PSCA SEAP reporter cell line , expressing the human TLR3 gene was cultured in DMEM complete supplemented with 100 µ g / mL normocin , 30 µ g / mL blasticidin and 100 µ g / mL zeocin ( all antibiotics from Invivogen , San Diego , CA , USA ) . All cell lines were cultivated at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 in a humidiﬁed incubator . 2 . 3 . Vector Constructs and siRNA The DNA sequence and features of single - chain antibody derivative scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP and scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP have been described previously [ 10 ] . Both constructs include an N - terminal Ig κ leader sequence , a biotin acceptor peptide ( P - BAP ) and a C - terminal c - myc epitope and a 6x histidine ( His ) - tag . The siRNAs for knockdown of ﬁreﬂy luciferase ( siLuc , 5 (cid:48) - CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA ( tt ) - 3 (cid:48) , Euroﬁns MWG Biotech , Ebersbach , Germany ) and human Survivin ( siSurv , 5 (cid:48) - GAAUUAACCCUUGGUGAAU ( tt ) - 3 (cid:48) , Euroﬁns MWG Biotech , Ebersbach , Germany ) have been described previously [ 29 ] . Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 4 of 15 2 . 4 . Production of scFv - P - BAP and Polyplexes The biotinylated scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP was expressed in transiently transfected 293T huBirA producer cells . The biotinylated scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP was produced in 293T huBirA - scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP cells . The single - chain antibodies were puriﬁed from the har - vested cell culture supernatants using Ni 2 + - NTA afﬁnity chromatography . Brieﬂy , 50 mL of clariﬁed supernatant was passed through a Ni 2 + - NTA spin column ( Qiagen , Hilden , Ger - many ) and washed with 1X PBS containing 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM / 20 mM imidazole . Elution of bound scFvs was performed in 500 µ L 1X PBS containing 150 mM NaCl and 350 mM imidazole per column . Eluted scFvs were dialyzed in 1x PBS twice for 2 h and additionally for 12 h at 4 ◦ C . The biotinylated scFv - P - BAPs were further puriﬁed using avidin - biotin afﬁnity chromatography with monomeric avidin columns ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) according to the protocol of the manufacturer . Eluted scFvs were dialyzed again as described previously . The recombinant proteins were subsequently concentrated using Amicon tubes Ultra - 15 ( Merck Millipore , Burlington , MA , USA ) and were stored in aliquots at − 20 ◦ C . Polyplexes were generated as described previously [ 10 ] . Brieﬂy , polyplexes were built by sequential mixing of neutravidin , mono - biotinylated scFv - P - BAP and mono - biotinylated mal19 - PPI - biotin using molar ratios 1 : 2 : 1 . Saturation of remaining free biotin binding sites of neutravidin was accomplished with 0 . 3 mM D - biotin . Complexation between siRNA and mal19 - PPI was achieved using a molar ratio 1 : 4 . The electrostatic interactions between mal19 - PPI - biotin / neutravidin / scFv - P - BAP and mal19 - PPI / siRNA intermediate conjugates resulted in scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes . After 24 h incubation at 4 ◦ C , the generated polyplexes were used for the experiments . 2 . 5 . Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay SiRNA ( 100 pmol ) was incubated for 30 min at RT with increasing amounts of mal19 - PPI corresponding to molar ratios of 1 : 1 to 1 : 80 . For analysis of resistance to Rnase , siRNA / mal19 - PPI - dendriplexes ( 1 : 5 ) were incubated with RNase A / T1 Mix ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) for 30 min at 37 ◦ C . The dendriplexes were then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis [ 3 % ( w / v ) ] and analyzed under UV light ( G : Box Chemi XX9 , VWR , Darmstadt , Germany ) . 2 . 6 . Multiparameter Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis Multiparameter nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed using the ZetaView ®PMX120 ( Particle Metrix GmbH , Inning am Ammersee , Germany ) according to the manu - facturer’s instructions to determine the zeta potential and the particle size of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - polyplexes containing a control siRNA ( siLuc ) . Polyplexes were prepared as described above . Data were analyzed using the manufacturer’s software ( ZetaView 8 . 05 . 05 ) . 2 . 7 . RNA Interference and Western Blot Analysis Produced scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP and its conjugation to neutravidin was investigated using SDS - PAGE . For immunoblot analysis , 1 µ g of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP was separated by SDS - PAGE ( 12 % polyacrylamide gel ) under reducing conditions . Proteins were transferred by semi - dry Western Blot to a PVDF membrane ( Whatman ) . After blocking of the PVDF membrane with 5 % non - fat dry milk in Tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( TBS - T ) , the scFv - P - BAPs were detected using a primary monoclonal murine anti - c - myc antibody ( 1 : 5000 , Invitrogen ) and a secondary polyclonal rabbit anti - mouse IgG HRP conjugate ( 1 : 1000 ; Dako ) . Biotinylated scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAPs were detected by HRP - conjugated anti - biotin antibody ( 1 : 3000 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . For determination of conjugated scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP to neutravidin , the two components were mixed at various molar ratios of scFv - P - BAPs to neutravidin from 8 : 1 to 0 . 25 : 1 in 1x PBS for 30 min at room temperature . The polyplex - mediated knockdown of Survivin in PC3 PSCA cells was investigated using SDS - PAGE . Therefore , PC3 PSCA cells were consecutively transfected for three times every 8 h with scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP polyplexes containing siSurv . Polyplexes containing a control siRNA ( siLuc ) were included as control . Interferin - mediated transfection of siSurv into Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 5 of 15 PC3 PSCA cells was included to demonstrate the feasibility of siSurv for RNAi . Treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ; 140 mM NaCl ; 1 % Triton X - 100 ) 72 h after transfection . Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation . Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted on PVDF membrane using semi - dry Western Blotting . After blocking PVDF membrane with 5 % BSA in TBS - T , Survivin was detected using a polyclonal rabbit anti - human Survivin antibody ( 1 : 1000 , R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) , followed by HRP - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG secondary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ; Dako ) . To demonstrate equal loading , PVDF membranes were subsequently stained using an anti - α tubulin antibody ( 1 : 5000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , followed by a secondary polyclonal rabbit anti - mouse IgG HRP conjugate ( 1 : 1000 ; Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) . Visual capturing of proteins was performed by Luminata Forte Western HRP substrate ( Merck Millipore ) and G : Box Chemi XX9 ( VWR ) gel doc system and analyzed by Fiji software ( ImageJ 1 . 51k , National Institute of Health ) . Clonogenic Survival Assay To determine frequency of clonogenic survival , 1 × 10 3 PC3 PSCA cells incubated with scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugates for 24 h were plated in 10 cm plates . Cells incu - bated with scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugates were included as negative control . At day 14 , cells were stained with Giemsa staining solution ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) and adherent colonies were counted . 2 . 8 . Flow Cytometry Binding of biotinylated scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP to PSCA - positive target cells was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry analysis after staining of 2 × 10 5 cells with 5 µ g scFv - P - BAP for 1 h at 4 ◦ C , followed by secondary anti - biotin - VioBlue antibody ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . Cells stained only with secondary antibody were included as con - trol . To assess siRNA uptake driven by scFv - P - BAP - polyplexes , 2 × 10 5 293T PSCA / ffLuc cells were incubated with Cy3 - labelled polyplexes for 4 h at 37 ◦ C . Subsequently , cells were washed with 0 . 1 % Heparin / PBS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cy3 - labelled polyplexes with scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP and without scFv were included as negative controls . Interferin ( Poly - plus transfection ) - mediated uptake of Cy3 - labelled siRNA was comprised as positive con - trol . To determine cell proliferation , 1 × 10 5 PC3 PSCA cells labelled with carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester ( CFSE , BioLegend ) were incubated with scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugates or scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugates using molar ratios of 2 : 1 . The cells were cultivated 1 – 7 days prior to analysis by ﬂow cytometry , and crosslinking with the scFv - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugates was repeated every 24 h . At least 2 × 10 4 cells were measured by MACSQuant Analyzer 10 ﬂow cytometer ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and analyzed by FlowJo software version 10 . 1 ( TreeStar Inc . , Ashland , OR , USA ) . 2 . 9 . Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy For visualization of cellular siRNA uptake , 6 × 10 5 293T PSCA / ffLuc cells grown on a coverslip were incubated with scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - polyplexes loaded with Cy3 - labelled siRNA for 24 h at 37 ◦ C . After ﬁxation of cells with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , cell membranes and nuclei were stained with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated Wheat Germ Ag - glutinin ( WGA , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and Hoechst 33 , 342 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) according to the manufacturers protocols . The coverslips were placed upside down in a drop of mounting medium ( Vector Laboratories ) on a microscope slide . Cy3 - labelled polyplexes conjugated with control scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP , which cannot bind to 293T PSCA / ffLuc cells or without conjugation of scFv - P - BAP were included as negative controls . The images were captured by a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Leica SP5 , Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) and analyzed by Fiji software ( ImageJ 1 . 51k , National Institute of Health ) . Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 6 of 15 2 . 10 . Determination of Luciferase Activity For testing speciﬁc luciferase knockdown when using PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes de - livering siRNA for luciferase ( siLuc ) , 1 . 5 × 10 5 293T PSCA / ffLuc cells were transfected with scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP polyplexes containing siLuc . For assessing the route of internalization , 0 . 6 µ g / mL ﬁlipin III and 6 . 0 µ g / mL chlorpromazine ( both Sigma - Aldrich ) were added 1 h prior polyplex treatment . In all experiments , polyplexes loaded with siLuc , but conjugated to a control scFv - P - BAP ( scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP , speciﬁc for EGFRvIII ) and polyplexes loaded with control siRNA speciﬁc for red ﬂuorescent protein ( siRFP1 ) conjugated to scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP or scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP served as negative controls . Interferin - mediated transfection of siLuc was included as positive control for RNAi of luciferase . Luciferase activities of total cell lysates were measured 72 h after transfection using the Luciferase Assay System ( Promega ) according to the protocol of the manufacturer . Chemiluminescence was mea - sured using Synergy 2 Multi - Mode Microplate Reader ( BioTek Instruments , Winooski , VT , USA ) . The luciferase knockdown efﬁciency of the different polyplexes was normalized to the corresponding siRFP1 - treated controls using the formula : knockdown efﬁciency [ % ] = 100 − ( ( relative light units ( RLU ) siLuc / RLUsiRFP1 ) × 100 ) . 2 . 11 . Analysis of Human TLR3 Activation To monitor human TLR3 activation by PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes loaded with Survivin siRNA , the HEK - Blue detection system was used as described previously [ 25 ] . Brieﬂy , 5 × 10 4 HEK - Blue hTLR3 / PSCA cells were incubated with PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes based on 25 pmol siRNA . The TLR3 ligand poly ( I : C ) ( 1 µ g / mL , Sigma - Aldrich ) was included as positive control . After 24 h , hydrolysis of secreted alkaline phosphatase ( SEAP ) color substrate ( InvivoGen ) by SEAP was quantiﬁed at 655 nm using Synergy 2 Multi - Mode Microplate Reader ( BioTek Instruments ) . 2 . 12 . Delivery of PSCA - Speciﬁc Polyplexes to Mice Bearing Human Prostate Cancer Xenografts The animal experiments were approved by the Landesdirektion Sachsen ( animal permission number : TVV 21 / 13 ) . The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations . 2 × 10 6 PC3 PSCA cells were subcutaneously im - planted into the right and left ﬂank of athymic nude mice ( NMRI Foxn1nu / Foxn1nu ) . After reaching an average tumor diameter of 2 . 5 mm , mice were injected intraperitoneally with PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes containing 10 µ g siSurv , 80 . 8 µ g mal19 - PPI , 15 . 6 µ g mal19 - bPPI , 43 . 8 µ g neutravidin , 35 . 9 µ g scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP and 1 . 8 µ g D - biotin every three days for 17 days . Mice injected with PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes loaded with negative control siRNA speciﬁc for luciferase ( siLuc ) , with EGFRvIII - speciﬁc polyplexes containing siSurv or with EGFRvIII - speciﬁc polyplexes containing siLuc were included as negative controls . Tumor sizes were determined by measuring all three dimensions . 2 . 13 . Statistical Analysis All experiments were performed at least three times . Differences between groups were examined for statistical signiﬁcance using Student’s t - test . Values of p < 0 . 05 were considered as statistically signiﬁcant : * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , and * * * p < 0 . 001 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Synthesis and Characterization of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP Molecules Here , we explored a biotin - neutravidin - based , so - called polyplex modular system for anti - PSCA scFv antibody - mediated delivery of poly ( propylene imine ) carrier molecules containing Survivin - speciﬁc siRNA to PSCA - positive tumor cells . For this , we established a PSCA - speciﬁc scFv ( AM1 ) , fused to a biotin acceptor peptide sequence ( P - BAP ) , and an similarly structured EGFRvIII - speciﬁc scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP as negative control [ 10 ] . The structures of the scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP and scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP are shown in Figure 1A . All antibody constructs contained an N - terminal Ig κ chain leader sequence for the extracellular secretion as well as a C - terminal c - myc - epitope and a 6x histidine ( His ) - tag for detection Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 7 of 15 and puriﬁcation , respectively . The biotinylated scFv - P - BAPs were puriﬁed from clariﬁed cell culture supernatant of antibody - expressing 293T huBirA cells using Ni 2 + - NTA afﬁnity chromatography , followed by biotin afﬁnity chromatography to obtain only biotinylated scFv - P - BAPs . In addition to the detection of the c - myc - epitope in Western Blot analysis , a biotin - speciﬁc antibody demonstrated the successful biotinylation of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP and the control antibody scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP ( Figure 1B ) . The observed bands match the calculated molecular mass of roughly 55 kDa . The Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained polyacrylamide gel shown in Figure 1C conﬁrmed the purity and successful expression of the full - length proteins ( Figure 1C ) . The binding properties of the scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP were characterized by ﬂow cytometry ( Figure 1D ) . Results clearly demonstrated highly efﬁcient binding of the scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP to 293T PSCA and PC3 PCSA cells , while as expected , the PSCA - speciﬁc single - chain antibody failed to bind to 293T and PC3 wild - type cells . Since a biotin - speciﬁc antibody was used as a secondary antibody , we were able to show that the C - terminal biotin residue was accessible under native conditions . As expected , the EGFRvIII - speciﬁc control antibody did not bind PSCA - positive 293T cells or PSCA - positive PC3 cells ( Figure 1D ) . Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , x 8 of 17 Figure 1 .

Assembly of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided Polyplexes The stable conjugation of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP to neutravidin was proven by Western Blot analysis shown in Figure 2A . A constant amount of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP was incubated with neutravidin at molar ratios 8 : 1 , 4 : 1 , 2 : 1 , 1 : 1 and 0 . 25 : 1 . Due to the high affinity of neutravidin to biotin , the conjugates remained stable during SDS - PAGE . The scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugates were detected by their C - terminal c - myc - epitope of the scFv - P - BAP . Distinct scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugate bands were detected at ap - proximately 100 and 160 kDa for molar scFv / neutravidin ratios 2 : 1 , 1 : 1 and 0 . 25 : 1 . Non - conjugated scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP containing an accessible biotin residue were detected by an anti - biotin antibody at approximately 55 kDa for molar scFv / neutravidin ratios 8 : 1 , 4 : 1 and 2 : 1 . In contrast , free biotinylated scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP was absent when using scFv / neu - travidin molar ratios of 1 : 1 and 0 . 25 : 1 . The proper complexation of siRNA with mal19 - PPI was confirmed by electrophoretic gel retardation assay shown in Figure 2B .

Assembly of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - Guided Polyplexes The stable conjugation of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP to neutravidin was proven by Western Blot analysis shown in Figure 2A . A constant amount of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP was incubated with neutravidin at molar ratios 8 : 1 , 4 : 1 , 2 : 1 , 1 : 1 and 0 . 25 : 1 . Due to the high afﬁnity of neutravidin to biotin , the conjugates remained stable during SDS - PAGE . The scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugates were detected by their C - terminal c - myc - epitope of the scFv - P - BAP . Distinct scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP / neutravidin conjugate bands were detected at approximately 100 and 160 kDa for molar scFv / neutravidin ratios 2 : 1 , 1 : 1 and 0 . 25 : 1 . Non - conjugated scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP containing an accessible biotin residue were detected by an anti - biotin antibody at approximately 55 kDa for molar scFv / neutravidin ratios 8 : 1 , 4 : 1 and 2 : 1 . In contrast , free biotinylated scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP was absent when using scFv / neutravidin molar ratios of 1 : 1 and 0 . 25 : 1 . The proper complexation of siRNA with mal19 - PPI was conﬁrmed by electrophoretic gel retardation assay shown in Figure 2B . Of note , all siRNA : mal19 - PPI molar ratios ranging from 1 : 1 to 1 : 80 led to full complexation of siRNA with the polycationic mal19 - PPI , as indicated by the absence of free siRNA migrating in the electrical ﬁeld . Furthermore , RNase protection assay conﬁrmed resis - tance of mal19 - PPI / siRNA - dendriplexes to RNAse A / T1 ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . To generate tumor - speciﬁc polyplexes delivering siRNA to target cells with cognate receptor expression , neutravidin was conjugated to mono - biotinylated scFv - P - BAP and mono - biotinylated mal19 - PPI - biotin using molar ratios 1 : 2 : 1 , respectively . To avoid potential biotin - driven agglutination through unwanted crosslinking of the components , the remain - ing biotin - binding pockets of neutravidin were saturated after conjugation of scFv - P - BAPs and mal19 - PPI - biotin by adding D - biotin . Complexation between siRNA and mal19 - PPI was achieved using a molar ratio 1 : 4 . The electrostatic interactions between mal19 - PPI - biotin / neutravidin / scFv - P - BAP ( bioconjugation adduct ( 1 ) and mal19 - PPI / siRNA ( bio - conjugation adduct ( 2 ) intermediate conjugates resulted in scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes ( Figure 2C ) . Assessment of the physiochemical properties of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - polyplexes revealed a negative surface charge ( − 26 . 7 mV ) and average particle size of 135 . 5 nm for molar siRNA / mal19 - PPI ratio 1 : 1 . With increasing mal19 - PPI macromolecules incorporated in scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - polyplexes zeta potential and particle size increased towards − 21 . 5 mV and 152 . 3 nm , respectively , for a molar siRNA / mal19 - PPI ratio of 1 : 5 . 3 . 3 . Targeted Delivery of siRNA in PSCA - Positive Tumor Cells For characterization of targeted siRNA delivery to tumor cells , 293T PSCA / ffLuc were treated with scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes . As negative controls , non - speciﬁc polyplexes containing the EGFRvIII - speciﬁc scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP or dendriplexes without scFv - P - BAP were included . All poly - and dendriplexes contained a Cy3 - labelled siRNA ( Cy3 - siLuc ) in order to allow detection of siRNA delivery into cells . Flow cytometry analysis , shown in Figure 3A , demonstrated a scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - mediated internaliza - tion of the polyplexes by 293T PSCA / ffLuc cells , whereas no Cy3 signals were detectable after treatment with non - speciﬁc dendriplexes devoid of scFv - P - BAP or polyplexes con - jugated with scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP , respectively . This indicates that the siRNA delivery is enabled by receptor - mediated endocytosis . The right histogram of Figure 3A shows a moderate unspeciﬁc internalization of dendriplexes ( devoid of scFv - P - BAP ) which is most likely mediated by electrostatic interaction between polyplexes and the cell mem - brane . Confocal laser scanning microscopy studies , shown in Figure 3B , supported the data obtained from ﬂow cytometry analysis . The tumor - speciﬁc scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - Cy3 - siLuc - polyplexes were found to be internalized by 293T PSCA / ffLuc cells . Well recognizable , the Cy3 - labelled siRNA was located intracellularly in the cytoplasm , but not on the outer mem - brane , thus conﬁrming cell internalization . In contrast , the scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes as well as the scFv - P - BAP - free dendriplexes show essentially no nanoparticle uptake . The endosomal release and knockdown potential of polyplex - mediated luciferase - speciﬁc siRNA in 293T PSCA / ffLuc cells was determined by a luciferase assay ( Figure 3C ) . Of note , PSCA - positive target cells treated with scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided siLuc - containing Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 9 of 15 polyplexes revealed a signiﬁcant 39 % decrease in luciferase activity , while luciferase knock - down of control polyplexes conjugated to non - binding scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - BAP was less than 3 % . The low knockdown activities of the non - speciﬁc control polyplexes thus coincided with the data from ﬂow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis shown above . To analyze the receptor mediated uptake of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes in more detail , the same experiments were conducted in the presence of inhibitors of endocytosis . In general , endocytosis of human cells can be differentiated between clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis , which can be blocked by chlorpromazine [ 30 ] , is characterized by the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles from clathrin - coated pits , which then enter the endosomal pathway [ 31 ] . In contrast , clathrin - independent endocytosis involves caveolae - dependent and lipid raft - mediated mechanisms that are inhibited by ﬁlipin III [ 32 ] . Clearly , the ﬁlipin III treatment of 293T PSCA / ffLuc cells during incubation with scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes abol - ished RNAi - mediated luciferase knockdown , while endocytosis and gene knockdown were not inhibited by treatment with chlorpromazine . This identiﬁes clathrin - independent endocytosis as the uptake mechanism . Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , x 9 of 17 PPI / siRNA - dendriplexes to RNAse A / T1 ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . To generate tumor - specific polyplexes delivering siRNA to target cells with cognate receptor expression , neu - travidin was conjugated to mono - biotinylated scFv - P - BAP and mono - biotinylated mal19 - PPI - biotin using molar ratios 1 : 2 : 1 , respectively . To avoid potential biotin - driven aggluti - nation through unwanted crosslinking of the components , the remaining biotin - binding pockets of neutravidin were saturated after conjugation of scFv - P - BAPs and mal19 - PPI - biotin by adding D - biotin . Complexation between siRNA and mal19 - PPI was achieved using a molar ratio 1 : 4 . The electrostatic interactions between mal19 - PPI - biotin / neu - travidin / scFv - P - BAP ( bioconjugation adduct ( 1 ) and mal19 - PPI / siRNA ( bioconjugation adduct ( 2 ) intermediate conjugates resulted in scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes ( Fig - ure 2C ) . Assessment of the physiochemical properties of scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - polyplexes revealed a negative surface charge ( − 26 . 7 mV ) and average particle size of 135 . 5 nm for molar siRNA / mal19 - PPI ratio 1 : 1 .

PSCA - Speciﬁc Polyplexes Delivering Survivin siRNA Exert Anti - Tumor Effects in PC3 PSCA Xenograft - Bearing Mice For the exploration of our system in a more relevant therapeutic in vivo situation , we investigated the efﬁcacy of targeted RNAi - mediated Survivin knockdown in PC3 PSCA xenografts in NMRI Fox1nu / Fox1nu mice . The efﬁcient knockdown of Survivin expression upon successful delivery of siSurv into PC3 PSCA cells by PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes was ﬁrst proven in vitro , with Survivin knockdown almost reaching efﬁciencies of interferin as classical reagent for in vitro siRNA transfection ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . This also demonstrates the efﬁcacy of the selected siRNA . For in vivo therapy , the scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes containing the Survivin - speciﬁc siRNA ( siSurv ) were injected intraperi - toneally ( i . p . ) every third day for 17 days into PC3 PSCA tumor - bearing mice ( Figure 4A ) . Remarkably , this treatment with siSurv - loaded scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes led to a profound , ~ 50 % inhibition of subcutaneous tumor growth when compared to the double - negative control group , i . e . , mice treated in the same way with polyplexes containing the non - binding scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP and negative control siLuc ( Figure 4B ) . Notably , however , anti - tumor effects were also observed in mice treated with polyplexes containing the PSCA targeting antibody scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP plus negative control siRNA ( siLuc ) or treated with non - targeted , scFv ( MR1 . 1 ) - P - BAP - guided polyplexes loaded with siSurv . While these therapeutic effects reached statistical signiﬁcance as well , they were less profound com - pared to the double - speciﬁc treatment group . To exclude anti - tumor activity of polyplexes due to siRNA - mediated activation of Toll - like receptor 3 ( TLR3 ) [ 33 , 34 ] , PSCA - engineered HEK - Blue hTLR3 / PSCA reporter cells were treated with polyplexes loaded with siSurv . As shown in Supplementary Figure S3 , the potent TLR3 ligand poly ( I : C ) induced SEAP ex - pression in the reporter cells , whereas internalized scFv ( AM1 ) - P - BAP polyplexes and the non - internalized scFv ( MR . 1 . 1 ) - P - BAP - polyplexes , both loaded with siSurv , did not induce an innate cellular immune response . Thus , it can be concluded that the siRNAs and their complexation with mPPI did not interfere with TLR3 signaling and that the moderate anti - tumor effects observed after systemic administration of polyplexes containing the control antibody in PC3 PSCA tumor - bearing mice are based on the non - targeted delivery of siSurv . Likewise , the results of this study demonstrate moderate anti - tumor activity of PSCA antibodies , which is in line with previous reports [ 18 ] and contributes to the anti - tumor effects of our system .

Discussion Since the discovery of RNAi as a powerful method for gene silencing [ 35 ] , RNAi ef - fector molecules ( e . g . , synthetic siRNA ) have been applied in numerous clinical trials [ 36 ] , which has more recently led to the approval of the first siRNA therapeutics ( Patisiran , Givosiran ) . However , before RNAi - based therapeutic approaches can be applied , signifi - cant hurdles still need to be overcome , such as the development of efficient delivery sys - tems . Recently , we established a novel tumor - specific siRNA delivery system , consisting of maltose - modified - PPI / PPI - biotin , neutravidin and a biotinylated scFv for targeted siRNA delivery to tumor cells [ 10 ] . Here , we investigated this modular platform technol - ogy with regard to the combination of a therapeutic siRNA for knockdown of a relevant target ( Survivin ) with a PSCA - specific scFv that simultaneously functions as a targeting moiety and PSCA inhibitor . PSCA was chosen since it is found on a broad range of tumor entities [ 20 – 23 ] . Recent studies from our group have established PSCA as a targetable an - tigen , which after receptor crosslinking by anti - PSCA immunoconjugates induces endo - cytosis [ 25 ] . In general , two main pathways for receptor - mediated endocytosis can be dis - tinguished : clathrin - dependent and caveolae - dependent and lipid raft - mediated endocy - tosis . In this study , we identify caveolae / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis , but not clathrin - mediated endocytosis as the mechanism of PSCA - specific polyplex internalization . These findings are in line with previous studies , that demonstrated involvement of caveolae - dependent endocytosis in the internalization of other GPI - anchored proteins [ 16 – 19 , 37 ] . Yet , these results are in contrast to our recent report which revealed a mixed clathrin - and Figure 4 .

Discussion Since the discovery of RNAi as a powerful method for gene silencing [ 35 ] , RNAi effector molecules ( e . g . , synthetic siRNA ) have been applied in numerous clinical trials [ 36 ] , which has more recently led to the approval of the ﬁrst siRNA therapeutics ( Patisiran , Givosiran ) . However , before RNAi - based therapeutic approaches can be applied , sig - niﬁcant hurdles still need to be overcome , such as the development of efﬁcient delivery systems . Recently , we established a novel tumor - speciﬁc siRNA delivery system , consist - ing of maltose - modiﬁed - PPI / PPI - biotin , neutravidin and a biotinylated scFv for targeted siRNA delivery to tumor cells [ 10 ] . Here , we investigated this modular platform technology with regard to the combination of a therapeutic siRNA for knockdown of a relevant target ( Survivin ) with a PSCA - speciﬁc scFv that simultaneously functions as a targeting moiety and PSCA inhibitor . PSCA was chosen since it is found on a broad range of tumor enti - ties [ 20 – 23 ] . Recent studies from our group have established PSCA as a targetable antigen , which after receptor crosslinking by anti - PSCA immunoconjugates induces endocytosis [ 25 ] . In general , two main pathways for receptor - mediated endocytosis can be distinguished : clathrin - dependent and caveolae - dependent and lipid raft - mediated endocytosis . In this study , we identify caveolae / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis , but not clathrin - mediated endocytosis as the mechanism of PSCA - speciﬁc polyplex internalization . These ﬁndings are in line with previous studies , that demonstrated involvement of caveolae - dependent endocytosis in the internalization of other GPI - anchored proteins [ 16 – 19 , 37 ] . Yet , these Pharmaceutics 2021 , 13 , 676 13 of 15 results are in contrast to our recent report which revealed a mixed clathrin - and caveolae - mediated uptake of nanoparticle - like immunoconjugates comprising mono - biotinylated anti - PSCA - scFv conjugated via neutravidin to mono - biotinylated TLR3 agonist [ 25 ] . This discrepancy may be due to differences in nanoparticle sizes , since the nanoparticle - like im - munoconjugates were estimated to be in the range of 22 – 55 nm in size , whereas the particle sizes of polyplexes were determined at 84 – 220 nm [ 23 ] . It remains to be investigated how the size of nanoparticles will indeed affect the mode of receptor - mediated internalization . It is unanimously recognized that endosomal release of siRNA into cytoplasm is one of the key hurdles for most siRNA and nucleic acid delivery systems , often limiting their therapeutic effects . Notably , we demonstrated RNAi - mediated luciferase knock - down in 293T PSCA / ffLuc reporter cells after targeted delivery of siLuc using PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes , indicating efﬁcient endosomal escape of siRNA molecules . Concomitantly , PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes delivering siSurv showed profound downregulation of Survivin in PC3 PSCA prostate cancer cells in vitro . In line with this , our in vivo administration of PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes in human PC3 PSCA xenograft - bearing mice led to a signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor growth . Of note , PSCA - targeted polyplexes containing siLuc con - trol siRNA resulted in moderate anti - tumor effects as well . This is in line with previous studies reporting that anti - PSCA monoclonal antibodies derived from hybridoma 1G8 signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of established orthotopic tumors and prolonged the survival of mice bearing human prostate cancer xenografts [ 18 , 38 ] . Although our scFv was derived from a different hybridoma ( 7F5 ) [ 39 ] , it is conceivable that the scFv ( AM - 1 ) - P - BAP antibody derivative when embedded in a polyplex might induce some inhibitory effects on PSCA - expressing cells . Yet , treatment of PC3 PSCA cells with PSCA - speciﬁc polyplexes loaded with siLuc had no effects on apoptosis or clonal survival of PC3 PSCA cells in vitro ( Supplementary Figures S4 and S5 ) . This also indicates that classical 2D cell culture systems may only insufﬁciently monitor tumor - inhibitory effects of anti - PSCA antibodies , which can also rely on the modulation of other processes critical for tumor growth like tumor cell differentiation [ 40 ] , modulation of angiogenesis factors [ 41 ] or disruption of cell – cell or cell - matrix interaction [ 42 ] . Moderate anti - tumor effects were also observed after systemic administration of control polyplexes loaded with Survivin - siRNA . This may well be due to the non - targeted delivery of the siRNA , probably facilitated by the enhanced permeabil - ity and retention ( EPR ) effect [ 43 ] , that is often observed in tumors and can support the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissue . 5 . Conclusions In summary , we successfully validated a modular platform technology for the targeted delivery of therapeutic siRNA to tumor cells . In succeeding experiments , it is mandatory to investigate potential beneﬁcial effects but also limitations of tumor targeting polyplexes to pave the way for translation into the clinics . In particular , studies using syngeneic tumors models are envisioned to investigate potential immune responses due to facilitated release of tumor antigens after treatment with polyplexes delivering therapeutic siRNAs .
