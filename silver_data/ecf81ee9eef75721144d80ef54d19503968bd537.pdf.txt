Since the WA domain used in Figure 2A was purified from E . coli , while full - length Las17 was purified from yeast , we considered the possibility that activity differ - Results and Discussion ences might be due to the expression source . Therefore , we purified from yeast a carboxyl - terminal 106 amino Purified Full - Length Las17 Is Highly Active and Is Not Autoinhibited acid fragment of Las17 by the same method used to purify full - length Las17 . This WA domain had a similar To investigate the regulation of Las17 activity , we puri - fied full - length Las17 protein from yeast overexpressing activity to the WA domain purified from E . coli ( not shown ) , suggesting that the strong activity of Las17 is Las17 fused to nine repeats of the myc epitope tag . The tagged Las17 was affinity purified by using anti - myc not dueto its expressionsource , or to theresidual amino acidsleftontherecombinantproteinaftercleavagefrom antibody - coated beads , and the tag was cleaved by TEV protease digestion , leaving the sequence AAAENLYFQ the myc epitope tag . These data suggest that Las17 sequences amino terminal to the WA domain play an appended to the carboxyl terminus of Las17 ( Figure 1 ) . We tested the activity of Las17 on actin assembly in the important role in Arp2 / 3 complex activation . presenceandabsenceofpurifiedyeastArp2 / 3complex . In contrast to other WASp family members , Las17 was Effects of Profilin on Las17 - Arp2 / 3 Complex - Induced Actin Filament Nucleation not autoinhibited ( Figure 2A ) . Full - length Las17 potently activated Arp2 / 3 complex with half - maximal activation Profilin is an actin monomer binding protein that steri - cally blocks assembly of actin monomers onto the at 4 . 2 nM ( Figures 2B and 2C ) , 100 - fold stronger than the untagged mammalian WASp - WA fragment on mam - pointed end of the filament and suppresses spontane - ous nucleation of actin filaments from free monomers malian Arp2 / 3 complex ( half - maximal activation at 425 Current Biology 1002 ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . High concentrations of profilin inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly stimulated by the WA domains of SCAR or Las17 ( [ 7 ] and Figure 3A ) . We used this observation to test whether activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by full - length Las17 works by a different mechanism than WA domain activation of Arp2 / 3 com - plex . Concentrations of profilin that strongly inhibited maximal WA domain activation of Arp2 / 3 complex had no effect on full - length Las17 - mediated actin assembly ( Figure 3A ) . Since Las17 contains several putative pro - filin binding poly - proline sequences , we tested whether direct binding of profilin to Las17 might alleviate the negative effects of profilin on actin assembly . Arp2 / 3 complex stimulation by Las17 was tested in the pres - ence of a mutant profilin ( Pfy1 - 19 , containing the muta - tion Y120D ) that has at least ten - fold reduced poly - proline binding [ 20 ] . Wild - type yeast profilin binds to extended poly - proline stretches ( Pro 50 ) with a dissocia - tion constant of 5 . 5 (cid:1) M [ 21 ] . Therefore , Pfy1 - 19 should have a dissociation constant above 50 (cid:1) M . Pfy1 - 19 in - hibited the assembly of actin alone , similar to wild - type profilin ( data not shown and [ 20 ] ) , but had no inhibitory effects on Las17 - mediated actin assembly in the range of Pfy1 - 19 concentrations tested ( Figure 3A ) . These data suggest that Las17 - profilin binding does not alleviate inhibition of actin assembly by profilin . One caveat to this interpretation is that Pfy1 and Pfy1 - 19 may have a much higher affinity for Las17 than for poly - proline , since mammalian profilin - I has a higher affinity for N - WASpthanforpoly - proline [ 22 ] . However , noassocia - tion has yet been detected between Las17 and profilin in multiple efforts to find Las17 - interacting partners ( e . g . , [ 10 , 15 , 23 ] ) . Arp2 / 3 complex activation is thought to be mediated by a combination of two inputs : conformational change induced by binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to the sides of actin filaments , and conformational change induced by activator binding ( reviewed in [ 2 ] ) . To explain the effects of profilin on WA - Arp2 / 3 complex , we considered the possibility that by preventing spontaneous formation of actinfilamentsatearlystagesofassembly , profilinmight inhibit WA - mediated Arp2 / 3 complex activation . To test this model , we added preformed actin filaments to WA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex . While preformed filaments eliminated the lag phase of actin polymerization , they did not overcome the inhibitory effects of profilin ( Figure 3B ) ; this finding suggests that profilin does not inhibit WA - Arp2 / 3 complex by suppressing spontaneous fila - ment polymerization . What then accounts for the inhibition of WA - Arp2 / 3 complex by profilin ? Current models for activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by WASp and SCAR / WAVE proteins suggest that binding of WA to actin monomers is crucial for nucleation ( reviewed in [ 2 ] ) . It is possible that high Figure 2 .

In contrast , full - length Las17 may have a significantly Since purified Las17 , like purified WAVE , is not autoin - hibited , we tested whether Las17 might be regulated by higher affinity for actin monomers or Arp2 / 3 complex than its WA domain alone and therefore may efficiently trans - acting inhibitory ligands , as has been shown for WAVE - 1 [ 8 , 26 ] . Sla1 interacts with Las17 by the two - displace profilin from these ligands . To evaluate this model , we tested whether profilin hybrid assay [ 16 ] and coimmunoprecipitation [ 9 ] , and is required for normal actin organization and endocytosis could compete with subsaturating concentrations of Las17 ( 5 nM , subsaturating in Figure 2B ) . Profilin could in vivo [ 27 , 28 ] and for actin assembly in permeabilized yeast cells [ 29 ] . Sla1 has three amino - terminal SH3 do - inhibitsubsaturating full - lengthLas17 , and highconcen - trations of profilin had inhibitory effects on saturating mains , a central region with SHD1 and SHD2 ( Sla1 ho - mology ) domains , conserved in all fungal Sla1 homo - Las17 ( Figure 3C ) . Therefore , profilin has similar but much less potent inhibitory effects on Las17 - Arp2 / 3 complex logs , and carboxyl - terminal repeats similar to regions of the yeast Eps15 homolog Pan1 ( Figure 1A ; also [ 30 , compared to WA - Arp2 / 3 complex . These results suggest that full - length Las17 acts by a similar mechanism as 31 ] ) .

Therefore , we reasoned that Sla1 and Bbc1 might have similar effects on Las17 activity . Sla1 , Bbc1 , and a fragment of Sla1 containing its three SH3 domains were purified from yeast by the same method used to purify Las17 ( Figure 1 ) . Saturating amounts of Sla1SH3 inhibited Las17 - Arp2 / 3 complex activity by 39 % , with a half - maximal concentration of 200 nM Sla1SH3 ( Figure 4A ) . This value is consistent with the tightest reported binding affinities of SH3 do - mains for their ligands [ 33 ] . The SH3 domain - containing fragment of Sla1 proved to be significantly more amena - bletopurificationand manipulationthanfull - lengthSla1 , and since both Sla1 constructs had similar activity on Las17 - Arp2 / 3 complex ( not shown ) , only data using the Sla1 fragment ( referred to as Sla1SH3 ) are shown . Bbc1 also had an inhibitory activity on Las17 ; 150 nM Bbc1 inhibited Las17 activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by 28 % ( Figure 4B ) . The combination of Sla1SH3 and Bbc1 to - gether had a more pronounced effect ( 63 % maximum , Figure 4B ) than could be achieved by using Sla1 alone . By comparison , Sla1SH3 and Bbc1 had no effect on WA - Arp2 / 3 complex activity , indicating that their effects require sequences in Las17 amino terminal to the WA domain . We were unable to purify sufficient amounts of Bbc1 to saturate its inhibitory effect on Las17 . However , 250 nM Bbc1 had an equally strong additive effect with both subsaturating ( 0 . 5 (cid:1) M ) and saturating ( 2 (cid:1) M ) amounts of Sla1SH3 ( see the Supplemental Data avail - able with this article online ) . This suggests that Sla1 and Bbc1actthroughdistinctbindingsitesonLas17 . 200nM Abp1withmutatedacidicsequences ( andthusunableto stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex [ 34 ] ) , but with an intact SH3 domain , had no effect on Las17 activation of Arp2 / 3 complex ( not shown ) . Thus , the activities of Sla1 and Bbc1onLas17requirespecificSH3domaininteractions . To define which SH3 domain ( s ) in Sla1 are required for inhibition of Las17 - Arp2 / 3 complex , we generated point mutations in the conserved tryptophan residues of each of the three Sla1 SH3 domains ( W41A , W108A , and W391A ) . These typesof mutationshave beenshown to abolish SH3 domain interactions with proline - rich tar - gets [ 35 ] . Inactivation of either the first ( Sla1SH3 - 1 * ) or second ( Sla1SH3 - 2 * ) SH3 domain of Sla1 alone dimin - ished the inhibition of Las17 ( Figure 4C ) . Disruption of the first and second SH3 domains together ( Sla1SH3 - 1 (cid:4) 2 * ) inactivated Sla1 to a similar extent as disruption of either SH3 domain alone . In contrast , disruption of Figure 4 . Effects of Sla1 and Bbc1 on Las17 Activity the third SH3 domain ( Sla1SH3 - 3 * ) had little effect ( Fig - ( A – C ) ( A ) A total of 3 (cid:1) M or ( B and C ) 3 . 5 (cid:1) M rabbit muscle actin ( 1 % ure 4C ) , further supporting the specificity of inhibition pyrene labeled ) was polymerized in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Arp2 / 3 complex , Las17 , Bbc1 , or the Sla1 frag - of Las17 activity by the first and second SH3 domains ment .

Arp2 / 3 complex was used thus , any residual inhibition in these mutants is not due at 15 nM , Las17 was used at 15nM , and the Sla1 SH3 fragments to activity of the third SH3 domain of Sla1 ( Figure 4C ) . were used at 1 (cid:1) M . Percent inhibition was normalized to the activity These results wereunexpected , given that arecent anal - of wild - type Sla1SH3 . The bars show the average and standard deviation from at least two independent experiments . ysis of yeast SH3 domain interactions predicted that the third SH3 domain of Sla1 and the SH3 domain of Bbc1 can interact with the same proline - rich site on Las17 of Sla1 make distinct interactions with Las17 , since their [ 16 ] . However , the first and second SH3 domains of Sla1 activities are additive even when using amounts of Sla1 were not included in the above - mentioned study . Our that saturate its activity alone ( see the Supplemental Data ) . results show that Bbc1 and the first two SH3 domains Negative Regulation of Yeast WASp 1005 Sla1SH3 and Bbc1 could act together by recruiting Sla1 was sufficient to disrupt inhibition of Las17 in vitro , whereas either single mutant alone caused a less severe each other to Las17 , thus increasing overall affinity or inhibitory activity . Indeed , Bbc1 contains a recognition phenotype than the SH3 - 1 (cid:4) 2 * double mutant in vivo . One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that site for the third SH3 domain of Sla1 , and Sla1 contains a proline - rich recognition site for the SH3 domain of our in vitro assay is not sensitive enough to measure differences in activity between the double and single Bbc1 [ 16 ] . To test this hypothesis , we compared Las17 activity in the presence of Bbc1 and wild - type Sla1SH3 mutants . Alternatively , otherligandsofLas17mayinhibit its activity in the cell enough to compensate for disrup - or Sla1SH3 - 3 * . Bbc1 had the same additive inhibitory effect with Sla1SH3 - 3 * as with wild - type Sla1SH3 ; this tion of either SLA1 SH3 domain alone , but not for disrup - tion of both SH3 domains . A third and related explana - finding suggests that the third SH3 domain of Sla1 is not involved in the additive inhibition ( not shown ) . tion is that direct ligands of the first or second SH3 domain of Sla1 may provide compensatory inhibition of Las17 . The first and second SH3 domains of Sla1 were SLA1 and BBC1 Share an Overlapping Role In Vivo not included in a recent genome - wide analysis of SH3 Bbc1 is a component of Las17 / myosin I / Vrp1 complex domain interactions [ 16 ] . However , a genome - wide two - and binds to the SH3 domain of myosin I [ 11 , 36 ] . The hybrid interaction study between full - length proteins bbc1 (cid:5) null mutation alone has no growth phenotype but suggested binding of Sla1 to two other Las17 ligands , synthetically compromises the growth of other mutants , Rvs167 and Ysc84 [ 13 ] . These interactions were not including sla1 , sac6 , bni1 , cap1 , and sla2 [ 32 , 36 ] . Since predicted by the binding properties of Sla1SH3 - 3 [ 16 ] ; Sla1 and Bbc1 showed similar inhibitory effects on Las17 - this leaves open the possibility that Rvs167 and Ysc84 Arp2 / 3 complex , we tested whether their synthetic could bind to the first and / or second SH3 domain of growth defects in vivo might correlate with their bio - Sla1 and regulate Las17 . chemical activities . Our data support the model that there is a shared in We generated sla1 (cid:5) bbc1 (cid:5) double mutants and found vivo function for Sla1 and Bbc1 mediated by the first thattheywereviableatroomtemperaturebutweremore two SH3 domains of Sla1 ( Figure 5 ) .

However , mutation of either suggest that the first two SH3 domains of Sla1 in combi - the first or second SH3 domains of SLA1 in combination nation with Bbc1 negatively regulate Las17 . with the bbc1 (cid:5) null mutation reduced growth at 37 (cid:6) C , and mutation of both of these SLA1 SH3 domains in combination with bbc1 (cid:5) caused lethality at 37 (cid:6) C ( Figure Function and Regulation of Las17 In Vivo We have shown that Las17 has a much stronger ability 5A ) . These double mutant cells were large and round , which is a phenotype common for mutants in actin - to activate Arp2 / 3 complex than its carboxyl - terminal WA fragment and that full - length Las17 purified from associated proteins ( Figure 5B ) [ 37 ] . In contrast , muta - tion of the third SH3 domain of SLA1 in bbc1 (cid:5) cells had yeast by the method described here is not autoinhibited . Since mammalian WASp , for unknown reasons , can be no effect . We examined actin organization in sla1 bbc1 (cid:5) cells by rhodamine phalloidin staining .
