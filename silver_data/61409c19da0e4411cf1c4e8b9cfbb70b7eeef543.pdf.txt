This mechanosensing phenomenon occurs at the cell - matrix interface , where mechanical forces resulting from 16 cellular motion , such as migration or matrix stretching , are exchanged through surface receptors , primarily integrins , and 17 their corresponding matrix ligands . A pivotal player in this interaction is the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin and fibronectin ( FN ) bond , known 18 for its instrumental role in establishing new cell adhesion sites for migration . However , upregulation of the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bond is 19 associated with uncontrolled cell metastasis . This bond operates through catch bond dynamics , wherein the bond lifetime 20 paradoxically increases with greater force . The mechanism sustaining the characteristic catch bond dynamics of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN 21 remains unclear . Leveraging molecular dynamics simulations , our approach unveils a pivot - clip mechanism . Two key 22 binding sites on FN , namely the synergy site and the RGD ( arg - gly - asp ) motif , act as active points for structural changes in 23 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin . Conformational adaptations at these sites are induced by a series of hydrogen bond formations and breaks 24 at the synergy site . We disrupt these adaptations through a double mutation on FN , known to reduce cell adhesion . A 25 whole - cell finite element model is employed to elucidate how the synergy site may promote dynamic 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN binding , 26 resisting cell contraction . In summary , our study integrates molecular and cellular - level modeling to propose that FN’s 27 synergy site reinforces cell adhesion through enhanced binding properties and a mechanosensitive pivot - clip mechanism . 28 This work sheds light on the intricate interplay between mechanical forces and cell - matrix interactions , contributing to our 29 understanding of cellular behaviors in physiological and pathological contexts . 30 SIGNIFICANCE 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin serves as a crucial mediator of cell - matrix adhesion and has garnered attention as a target for impeding cancer metastasis . Despite its importance , the mechanism underlying the formation of a catch bond between 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin and its primary ligand , fibronectin , has remained elusive . Our study aims to address this gap by proposing a pivot - clip mechanism . This mechanism elucidates how 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin and fibronectin collaboratively reinforce cell adhesion through conformational changes induced by the dynamic interaction of a key binding motif , known as the synergy site . INTRODUCTION 31 Adhesion bonds enable cells to interact dynamically with their surrounding environment , orchestrating the regulation of essential 32 cellular processes such as proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis ( 1 – 5 ) . Integrins are transmembrane , heterodimeric 33 proteins that play an important role in cell adhesion by tethering the inside and outside of the cell via binding partners in 34 the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( 6 ) . 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin is one of 24 integrin heterodimers present in mammals ( 4 ) and mediates 35 cell - tissue homeostasis by binding to its primary ligand , fibronectin ( FN ) ( 7 , 8 ) . 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 and FN are linked together at the RGD 36 ( Arg - Gly - Asp ) motif and stabilized by the eight - amino - acid - long DRVPHSRN synergy site on FN ( 9 ) , allowing extracellular 37 and cytoplasmic forces to be transmitted across the cell membrane . The accumulation of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bonds form the basis for 38 1 Figure 1 : A ) Schematics of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin in its bent - closed , inactive state with FN fragment 7 - 10 unbounded ( left ) , extended - active state in complex with FN ( middle ) , and under an applied load ( right ) .

SYN : synergy site . RGD : arg - gly - asp . nascent cell adhesion and cell motion . Beyond 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s role in maintaining cell - tissue homeostasis , it has been implicated as 39 a potential therapeutic target for cancer ( 10 – 12 ) . For example , dysfunctional and overexpressed integrin bonds are markers of 40 uninhibited cancer cell migration ( 13 , 14 ) . As such , numerous antagonists have been developed to attenuate integrin bonds , 41 aiming to impede the invasion of multiple cancer cell types . Despite considerable efforts , these antagonists have faced challenges , 42 demonstrating limited success in effectively preventing cancer cell invasion . ( 15 , 16 ) . Therefore , a better understanding of the 43 biophysical nature of the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bond is needed to reveal mechanisms that can be exploited to target metastasis . 44 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin creates a catch bond with FN ( 9 , 17 , 18 ) , which is a type of bond that increases in lifetime with greater 45 applied force . The 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN catch bond allows for strong adhesion at the leading edge of a migrating cell and a steady release 46 of the bond at the cell’s trailing end . Catch bonds have inspired development of synthetic catch bonds for manufacturing 47 resilient materials ( 19 – 21 ) . However , the mechanisms involved in the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN catch bond’s ability to maintain its characteristic 48 strength is unknown . Understanding the underlying mechanism of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN catch bond resilience could identify structural 49 protein characteristics that can be targeted to arrest cancer cells through substrate or protein modifications . Moreover , structural 50 dynamics that enable catch bond behavior may inspire development of resistant nanomaterials with self strengthening properties . 51 Ideally , the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN catch bond could be imaged while an applied force is applied with a single - molecule testing setup ( e . g . , 52 optical trap or magnetic tweezers ) . However , current atomic - resolution molecular imaging techniques , like cryo - EM and x - ray 53 crystallography , require immobilizing the protein , making visualization of in situ structural changes of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN challenging . 54 In light of these experimental limitations , steered molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations have been used to visualize protein 55 conformational changes over time ( 22 , 23 ) . 56 Given 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s critical role in mechanosensing via its elusive catch bond dynamics , we used steered MD simulations 57 to visualize the motion of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN when acted on by an external load . We introduce a " pivot - clip " mechanism to model the 58 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s catch bond - like behavior , where the RGD motif acts as a stable pivot for FN about 𝛽 1 integrin and the synergy site 59 acts as a force - strengthening clip connecting FN to 𝛼 5 . Past experiments demonstrated that mutating the synergy site diminishes 60 catch bond behavior and weakens whole - cell and single molecule adhesion to 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 ( 18 , 24 ) . Even so , a lack of the synergy site 61 does not significantly limit cell traction on a 2D substrate ( 25 ) . To explain how the synergy site may promote 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN binding 62 while maintaining cell traction , we developed a 2D finite element ( FE ) model . Based on our MD and FE models , we present 63 a theory that the synergy site in FN reinforces cell adhesion via stronger binding affinity and a mechanosensitive pivot - clip 64 mechanism . 65 MATERIALS AND METHODS 66 Steered Molecular Dynamics Simulations 67 Constant velocity , all - atom steered MD simulations of the ectoplasmic 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN complex were run in GROMACS 2020 . 4 ( 26 ) . 68 The 7NWL crystal structure file of the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN complex with the TS2 / 16 Fv - clasp was downloaded from the protein data bank . 69 The 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin head domain and the FN type III fragment 7 - 10 were isolated using PyMOL ( 27 ) . We used MODELLER 70 10 . 4 ( 28 ) to impose a virtual R1374 / 9A double mutation , switching the arginine residues in positions 1374 and 1379 in FN to 71 alanine ( Figure 1B ) . 72 Wildtype and mutated structures were solvated in a TIP3P water box ( 18nm x 45nm x 19nm ) with 0 . 15 mM NaCl .

Positions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) correspond to the time at the peak force , local minimum , and final frame , respectively . was minimized for 15k steps with the steepest gradient descent algorithm , followed by an equilibration sequence of a 1ns NVT 74 simulation at 310K followed by a 10ns NPT simulation at 1 bar and 310K , per physiological conditions . Equilibration was 75 verified by ensuring that the RMSD of the fully unrestrained complexes ( Figure S1 ) were within 0 . 3nm resolution of cryoEM . 76 The K559 and E36 residues at the proximal ends of the integrin headpieces were then restrained . P1142 at the distal 77 end of the FN fragment was pulled at 10 and 1nm / ns using a 50kJ / mol / nm spring with an umbrella potential for 3ns and 78 20ns , respectively . The steered MD simulations used a 2fs timestep . We visualized the crystal structures and MD simulation 79 trajectories using Visual Molecular Dynamics ( VMD ) 1 . 9 . 4a ( 29 ) . All parameters for the MD simulations are available in 80 the supplementary materials ( Table S1 ) . The force and extension at 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s center - of - mass were derived directly from the 81 output files from Gromacs . The extension was measured as the displacement of the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s center - of - mass ( COM ) with 82 respect to the first simulation frame . The radius of gyration of the 𝛼 5 and 𝛽 1 heads was measured using the built - in Gromacs 83 function , gmx gyrate . Distances between key bonds at R1374 and R1379 were calculated by averaging the distance between 84 atom pairs that could form hydrogen bonds using the VMD bond select and graph tool . We used a distance cutoff of 0 . 35nm 85 ( 3 . 5 Angstrom ) and donor - hydrogen - acceptor angle cutoff of 30 in VMD to detect hydrogen bonds . 86 Force Distribution Analysis 87 Time - resolved force distribution analysis ( trFDA ) was used to measure the punctual stresses based on the Coulombic interactions 88 at all residues across all simulation time steps ( 30 ) . The punctual stress is the absolute value of scalar pairwise forces exerted on 89 each residue . Normally , stress would be in units of energy . However , the developers of punctual stress defined it as " force on 90 a dimensionless point " which uses units of force ( kJ / mol - nm ) . We opted to use this definition of punctual stress to remain 91 consistent with past studies . Parameters for the trFDA are available in the supplementary materials ( Table S2 ) . 92 Whole - cell Finite Element Model 93 We used a whole - cell FE model to calculate the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN concentration and force in a wildtype and mutant cell . We have 94 previously modeled the cell - substrate interface using a whole - cell FE model ; we refer the reader to that publication for the full 95 set of model equations ( 23 ) . In the present work , we introduced key changes to the catch bond model . We modeled the cell as a 96 2D elastic disk with neo - Hookean constitutive material properties on a rigid substrate , 97 𝜎 pasc = 𝜇 𝑐 b c − 𝑝 𝑐 I , ( 1 ) where 𝜎 pasc is the passive cell stress . The cell shear modulus is , 𝜇 𝑐 = 1kPa ( 31 , 32 ) . The deformation was characterized by 98 the left Cauchy - Green tensor b c . The pressure 𝑝 𝑐 was computed from plane stress boundary conditions . 99 3 An isotropic active stress field was applied inside the cell to model cell contractility , 100 𝜎 actc = 𝑡 𝑚𝑦𝑜 I , ( 2 ) where 𝜎 actc is the active cell stress due to an actomyosin traction , 𝑡 𝑚𝑦𝑜 in Pa ( 32 , 33 ) : 101 𝑡 𝑚𝑦𝑜 = (cid:26) 100 𝑡 0 < 𝑡 < 2 200 2 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 30 ( 3 ) where 𝑡 is the simulation time . 102 We used an existing catch bond model of adhesion to calculate the force - dependent concentration of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bonds per 103 node in the FE mesh ( 34 – 37 ) . The catch model assumed that the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN complexes behave as parallel springs that connect 104 and disconnect to the substrate based on an association constant , 𝐾 𝑜𝑛 and on a force dependent dissociation constant , 𝐾 𝑜 𝑓 𝑓 , 105 respectively . 106 𝐾 𝑜 𝑓 𝑓 = 𝐾 𝑎 𝑒 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑡𝐹𝑎 + 𝐾 𝑏 𝑒 − 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑡𝐹𝑏 , ( 4 ) where 𝐾 𝑎 , 𝐹 𝑎 , 𝐾 𝑏 , and 𝐹 𝑏 are fitted parameters ( Table S3 ) adapted from Bidone et al ( 37 ) and Takagi et al ( 38 ) . 𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑡 is 107 the magnitude of the force per 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bond . The force vector per bond , ( f int ) , is computed via the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN spring constant 108 𝑘 𝑖𝑛𝑡 = 0 . 5pN / nm ( 17 ) and the spring extension vector u int : 109 f int = 𝑘 𝑖𝑛𝑡 u int . ( 5 ) The force per node , f 𝑖 , 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 is related to the dimensionless concentration of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bonds 𝐶 with respect to the maximum 110 bond density 𝜌 𝑖 , 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 100 𝜇 m 2 ( 39 ) , and the local adhesion area 𝐴 at that node , 111 f 𝑖 , 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 = 𝐶𝜌 𝑖 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝐴 f int . ( 6 ) At any node , 𝑖 given the previous value of the bond concentration , 𝐶 , the updated bond concentration 𝐶 𝑡 + Δ 𝑡 at each 112 progressive time step is 113 𝐶 𝑡 + Δ 𝑡 = 𝐶 ( 1 − 𝐾 𝑜 𝑓 𝑓 Δ 𝑡 ) + 𝐾 𝑜𝑛 Δ 𝑡 ( 1 − 𝐶 ) . ( 7 ) Note that the updated eq . ( 7 ) is based on treating the bond kinetics in the limit of an ordinary differential equation discretized 114 in time with an explicit Euler scheme . 115 The internal force balance for the cell includes the elastic cell deformation ( 𝜎 pasc ) and the active cell contractile stress ( 𝜎 actc ) : 116 ∇ · 𝜎 c = 𝜌 𝑐 a 𝑐 , ( 8 ) in which 𝜎 c = 𝜎 pasc + 𝜎 actc is the total cell stress , 𝜌 𝑐 = 1000kg / m 3 is the cell density ( 40 ) and a 𝑐 is the cell acceleration . 117 The strong forms of the elastodynamic equation 8 has boundary conditions of the form 𝜎 · n = t on boundary Γ 𝑐 , i . e . 118 traction free boundary conditions . The internal forces were computed through the weak form . Briefly , we multiplied equation 8 119 by test function , 𝜈 , integrated over a domain Ω 𝑐 of thickness 1 𝜇 m , and applied divergence theorem to get the following weak 120 form for the cell . 121 − ∫ Ω 𝑐 𝜎 c : 𝛿 d c 𝑑 Ω 𝑐 + ∫ Γ 𝑐 t c · 𝛿𝜈 c 𝑑𝐴 𝑐 = − R c + f 𝑐 , 𝑒𝑥𝑡 = ∫ Ω 𝑐 𝜌 a c 𝑑 Ω 𝑐 , ( 9 ) The 𝛿 d is the variation of the symmetric velocity gradient , i . e . virtual work by moving each node by an independent 122 variation 𝛿𝜈 . R is the residual ( internal forces ) and the external force acting at a node of the cell mesh is : 123 f 𝑐 , 𝑒𝑥𝑡 = f 𝑖 , 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 + f 𝑑 + f 𝜅 + f 𝑎𝑐 + f 𝐴 , ( 10 ) where f 𝑖 , 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 is the force due to 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN at each node , f 𝑑 is viscous drag , f 𝜅 is curvature regularization , f 𝑎𝑐 is a random 124 fluctuation at the cell boundary from actin polymerization , and f 𝐴 is an area penalty to counteract cell contractility . 125 The mesh was updated by a dynamic explicit mesh generator , El Topo ( 41 ) , during the simulation run . The explicit mid - point 126 rule was used for time integration of the second order system of equations to update nodal velocities and positions . The 127 whole - cell FE simulation ran with a time step of 50 𝜇 s over the course of an assigned time of 𝑡 𝑠𝑖𝑚 = 30s . There were a total 128 of three simulation runs per R1374 / 9A mutant and wildtype catch bond condition , respectively . The three simulation bond 129 concentration and force outputs were time - averaged per condition . 130 4 Figure 3 : A ) Interactions between R1374—E124 and R1379—D154 at the beginning of the wildtype simulations .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 131 FN9 - 𝛼 5 disengagement coincides with synergy site deactivation 132 We analyzed force - extension in conjunction with punctual stress to determine the role of the synergy site in FN9 - 𝛼 5 133 disengagement . The initial force - extension curve of the wildtype 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN structure followed a linear response for both 10 134 and 1 nm / ns pull rates until peaking at 729pN and 462pN , respectively ( Figure 2A and B ) . The peak forces coincided with 135 sharp decreases in the punctual stress at the synergy site , namely at sites R1374 and R1379 in FN9 . R1379 has been shown to 136 be connected to D154 in the 𝛼 5 head via a salt bridge ( 13 ) . However , R1374 has not been previously observed to be actively 137 linked to 𝛼 5 . At both pull rates , R1374 retained higher punctual stresses than R1379 , but the sequence of disengagement was 138 dependent on the pull rate . Under the faster pull rate condition , the salt bridge was disrupted prior to a reduction in force on 139 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN and punctual stress at R1374 . This indicated that while the load on FN was sufficient to overcome the energetic barrier 140 to break the salt bridge connecting FN to 𝛼 5 , persistent electrostatic interaction at R1374 enabled additional force resistance . 141 This was not observed under the slower pull rate simulation , where we noted simultaneous punctual stress reduction in R1374 142 and R1379 at the peak force time point . While both residues were instrumental to resisting applied load at the synergy site , 143 faster rates that produced higher forces triggered new modes of force distribution at the residue - level . On the whole , the synergy 144 site engagement at multiple residues , as measured by the punctual stress , reduced after the peak force . 145 R1374 and R1379 were the primary contributors to punctual stress at the synergy site prior to the drop in force on 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN 146 ( Figure S2 ) . In both pull rate conditions , the combined punctual stress at R1374 / 9 prior to the force peak was on average two 147 5 times higher than other synergy site residues . Due to the importance of both sites , we mutated them ( R1374 / 9A ) to evaluate 148 their role in maintaining 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s structural response to force . At 10nm / ns , the force response of the wildtype and mutant 149 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN were similar , peaking at 729pN and 704pN , respectively ( Figure 2C ) . However , the punctual stresses at A1374 and 150 A1379 were 45 % and 40 % lower in the mutant case than the wildtype ( Figure 2C and D ) , indicating that the mutation disrupted 151 force transmission . Similar trends were observed in the 1nm / ns force rate condition , where the punctual stresses at A1374 and 152 A1349 were small relative to R1374 and R1379 , and the first peak force was lower in the mutant case ( wildtype = 462pN , 153 mutant = 291pN ; Figure 2D ) . 154 Punctual stress measurements provide insight into per - residue interactions and are substantiated by atomic - level interactions . 155 Specifically , the formation and breakage of hydrogen bonds between 𝛼 5 and FN9 are essential for relaying force between 156 the two . Since high punctual stresses were observed on R1374 and R1379 , we tracked bonds between R1379—D154 and 157 R1374—E124 ( Figure 3A ) . At both pull rates , the R1379—D154 salt bridge was broken before the maximum force was reached , 158 while residue R1374 remained bounded to either E124 or E81 depending on the pull rate ( Figure 3B and C ) . The measured 159 distance between R1374—E124 was within the range of a hydrogen bond ( 0 . 35nm ) after the departure of the R1379—D154 160 bond ( 10nm / ns case ; Figure 3D ) . At the slower pull rate , R1374 transitioned from E124 to E81 , maintaining contact between 161 FN9 and 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 together with R1379—D154 ( Figure 3E ) . Both bonds then released and the force on 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN consequently 162 dropped . The R1374 / 9A double mutation severed the main points of contact between FN9 and 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 , pushing the distance 163 between the residues to 0 . 65nm , beyond the 0 . 35nm hydrogen bond length cutoff ( Figure 3F ) . 164 For all test cases , the peak forces were followed by sharp increases in extension rate , suggesting a rapid conformational 165 change of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN ( Figure 2 ) . In the case of the wildtype 10nm / ns pull rate , the measured extension rate increased from 166 5 . 10nm / ns to 14 . 4nm / ns . Similarly , the wildtype 1nm / ns pull rate increased in rate from 0 . 547nm / ns to 1 . 82nm / ns ( Table 1 ) . 167 Notably , there was a mismatch between the input rate and measured rate . Steered MD simulations attempt to control the pull 168 rate via a virtual spring connecting a dummy atom to the pulled site . While the atom moves at a constant rate , the molecule’s 169 response depends on the virtual spring deflection and local conformational changes associated with the molecule . Therefore , it 170 is unlikely that the input pull rate matches the measured pull rate experienced by the molecule . Further , the output extension 171 was measured as the distance traveled by 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s COM , which depends on the structural behavior . 172 Our reported forces and pull rates are many orders of magnitude higher than what has been tested using atomic force 173 microscopy ( AFM ; 1 - 15 𝜇 m / s ) ( 42 ) . Given our large 1 . 5M atom system , we compromised on the simulation time scale by 174 applying extension rates within the bounds of past steered MD simulations of integrin ( 0 . 1 - 10 nm / ns ) ( 22 , 43 ) . The fast 175 extension rates contributed to simulated forces beyond what has previously been measured experimentally ( single molecule 176 rupture forces of 80 - 120pN ) ( 42 ) . Nevertheless , the difference between 10nm / ns and 1nm / ns was enough to note structural 177 shifts in 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN that enable larger force resistance due to synergy site engagement . 178 Table 1 : Measured extension rate ( nm / ns ) of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN under load in reference to the ( i ) peak and ( ii ) valley force , as seen in Figure 2 . Prior to ( i ) Between ( i ) and ( ii ) After ( ii ) 10nm / ns wildtype 5 . 10 14 . 4 9 . 21 10nm / ns R1374 / 9A 4 . 17 13 . 2 9 . 15 1nm / ns wildtype 0 . 547 1 . 82 0 . 546 1nm / ns R1374 / 9A 0 . 705 1 . 63 0 . 562 Conformational response of 𝛼 5 and 𝛽 1 was hampered by lack of synergy site engagement 179 We informed the differences in force and extension rates across conditions by visualizing the structural changes of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN 180 under both pull rates for the wildtype and mutant cases . We used the radius of gyration to quantify conformational changes 181 within 𝛼 5 and 𝛽 1 heads , with smaller radii indicating more compact proteins . In both wildtype runs , the 𝛼 5 head , which is 182 connected to the synergy site on FN9 , stretched further than the 𝛽 1 head , which is connected to the RGD motif on FN10 . 183 However , pull rate affected the degree of 𝛼 5 stretching . The lower 1nm / ns pull rate resulted in 0 . 165nm increase in 𝛼 5 ’s 184 radius of gyration , compared to a 0 . 407nm increase in the 10nm / ns rate simulation ( Figure 4A and B ) . Most of the 𝛼 5 head 185 deformation resulted before the peak force and synergy site disengagement . For the respective 10nm / ns and 1nm / ns rates , 186 97 . 7 % and 99 . 0 % of the max 𝛼 5 head deformation occurred prior to the peak force , when the synergy site loosened . From the 187 observations of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s quaternary structure , we noticed the 𝛼 5 head straightening while FN9 remained connected at the 188 synergy site ( Figure 4C ) . Further , at higher forces , 𝛼 5 underwent a greater degree of stretching and was able to resist synergy 189 site disengagement while FN9 unfolded ( Figure 4D ) . In contrast , lower forces seemed to encourage synergy site disengagement 190 6 Figure 4 : Force on 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN and radius of gyration of 𝛼 5 and 𝛽 1 head for the wildtype case pulled at A ) 10nmn / ns and B ) 1nm / ns . Positions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) correspond to the time at the peak force , local minimum , and final frame . The four shown frames from the simulation correspond to the first frame , ( i ) peak force , ( ii ) local minimum , and ( iii ) final frame for C ) 10nm / ns and D ) 1nm / ns wildtype cases . prior to FN unfolding . Our observation suggests that 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN’s catch bond dynamics may be promoted by greater synergy site 191 interaction in combination with 𝛼 5 extension to resist larger forces . The greater interaction may stem from the hydrogen bond 192 electrostatics at R1374 and R1379 that bridge 𝛼 5 to FN9 ( Figure 3 ) . 193 We tested the degree to which the synergy site contributed to structural changes in 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN by mutating the site ( R1374 / 9A ) 194 and again measuring the radius of gyration of 𝛼 5 and 𝛽 1 under an external load on FN . Surprisingly , the mutant pulled at 195 10nm / ns still resulted in conformational changes of the 𝛼 5 head , with the radius of gyration increasing by 0 . 266nm . However , 196 this was less than the 0 . 407nm increase observed in the wildtype ( Figure 5A ) . Further , the mutant pulled at the slower 1nm / ns 197 showed virtually no deformation of 𝛼 5 or 𝛽 1 ( Figure 5B ) . Investigating the quaternary structure of the mutant revealed that FN9 198 was separated immediately from 𝛼 5 ( Figure 5C and D ) . As the FN beta sheets stacked vertically in alignment with the pulling 199 direction , the force increased and peaked as soon as FN10 begun to unfold . For all simulations , the 𝛽 1 head kept a more stable 200 conformation , maintaining its radius of gyration within 0 . 12nm . 201 Our observations of the mutant trajectories support the conjecture that the synergy site may be responsible for reinforcing 202 integrin engagement ( 13 , 24 ) . Our results also imply that force between the synergy site and 𝛼 5 integrin head may be necessary 203 to induce conformational changes in both integrin heads . Overall , our results highlight the importance of the synergy site clip in 204 stabilizing and reinforcing the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bond after initial catch bond formation , which has also been previously suggested 205 experimentally ( 9 , 25 , 44 , 45 ) . While cell adhesion can be negated altogether by an RGD deletion as demonstrated by spinning 206 disk assays , the R1374 / 9A double mutation reduces cell adhesion strength by around 90 % ( 24 ) . So , while adhesion could still 207 occur , the bond strength was compromised due to the synergy site mutation , which has also been shown previously through 208 single molecule AFM ( 42 ) . Additionally , past surface plasmon resonance binding assays measure an 11 - fold decrease in affinity 209 between 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 and R1374A FN compared to wildtype ( 38 ) . Clearly , the role of the synergy site in maintaining a firm adhesion 210 cannot be understated . Here , we propose how the synergy site may give rise to specific molecular states of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin and 211 unfolding patterns of FN that show how adhesion reinforcement may occur in the presence of force . While our study highlighted 212 the reinforcing role of the synergy site at the molecular scale , we also sought to explore how this adhesion reinforcement may 213 dynamically manifest at the whole cell scale . 214 7 Figure 5 : Force on mutated 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN and radius of gyration of 𝛼 5 and 𝛽 1 head pulled at A ) 10nmn / ns and B ) 1nm / ns . For both figures , positions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) correspond to the time at the peak force , local minimum , and final frame . First frame of the simulation and three simulation frames corresponding to ( i ) peak force , ( ii ) local minimum , and ( iii ) final frame for C ) 10nm / ns and D ) 1nm / ns mutant cases . Synergy site presence led to adhesion reinforcement by recruiting 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin 215 We employed a whole - cell FE model that analyzed the adhesion interface that contained 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bonds under an isotropic cell 216 contraction that drove bond extension ( Figure 6A ) . Our simple model demonstrated an adaptive reinforcement of collective 217 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bonds due to the stronger binding affinity afforded by the synergy site . We modified the parameters for the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN 218 binding kinetics ( Table S3 ) to produce bond lifetime curves for the wildtype bond and R1374 / 9A mutant ( Figure 6B ) . The 219 differences in parameters between the two bond types resulted in an 11 - fold decrease in 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bond concentration ( Figure 220 6C ) , but no increase in equilibrium force ( Figure 6D ) . The areas of high concentrations and high forces are present at the 221 periphery of the cell during contraction ( Figures 6E and 6F ) , which has been shown by 2D Fluorescence Resonance Energy 222 Transfer ( FRET ) and traction force microscopy ( TFM ) assays ( 25 ) . Notably , mutant bonds compensate for the lack of number of 223 bonds by sustaining more of the cell’s contractile load . The higher recruitment of wildtype bonds distributes the forces more 224 evenly across the cell . 225 Our whole - cell FE model sheds light on the dynamic force balance at short timescales that are not as apparent experimentally . 226 TFM of cells plated on 2D substrates have shown that cell contraction and individual bond force were not altered due to an 227 absence of the synergy site ( 25 , 45 ) . Our model used the same 200Pa cell contraction across both conditions , but showed a stark 228 difference in how the adhesion forces are handled by the bonds . Namely , while forces eventually equalized between mutant and 229 wildtype conditions , we observed an initial dynamic adjustment of high forces at the cell boundary for mutant bonds ( Figure 230 6F ) . Specifically , average forces measured from mutated bonds peaked at 7pN , while wildtype bonds peaked at 3pN ; both 231 average bond forces were within the previously measured 1 - 7pN range ( 25 ) . A body of work has shown the reduction in cell 232 adhesion strength at the single molecule and whole cell scale due to a lack of synergy site engagement ( 24 , 25 , 42 , 45 ) . In spite 233 of the reduced bond strength , our work showed that the binding affinity gain due to the presence of the synergy led to a more 234 stable , dynamic force balance across the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bonds on the cell surface . 235 8 Figure 6 : A ) Schematic of whole - cell interface model that assumes that integrin behaves as a spring that is stretched due to cell contraction .

Pivot - clip mechanism of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN as a model for cell adhesion reinforcement 236 The mechanosensitive pivot - clip mechanism provides a model to consider how the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN catch bond reinforces cell adhesion 237 across molecular and cell scales under cell - matrix forces ( Figure 7A ) . At both pull rates tested in the wildtype 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bonds , 238 the unbinding of FN9 - 𝛼 5 coincided with a plateauing of 𝛼 5 extension and a small compression of 𝛽 1 ( Figure 4A and B ) . With 239 the link between FN9 - 𝛼 5 broken , FN10 was free to rotate about the RGD motif on 𝛽 1 ( Figure 4C and D ) . The FN10 rotation 240 about the RGD site was maintained in the mutant runs while diminishing the extension of 𝛼 5 , especially in the high pull rate 241 condition ( Figure 5 ) . Based on the structural changes observed on 𝛼 5 and 𝛽 1 , the synergy site clipped the 𝛼 5 head to FN9 while 242 the RGD motif on 𝛽 1 acted as a pivot for FN10 ( Figure 7B ) . The degree to which the clip engaged was force dependent , with 243 higher forces leading to greater clip engagement due to hydrogen bond rearrangement . While it has been known that the synergy 244 site plays a role in catch bond dynamics ( 17 , 24 ) , the heightened clip engagement under higher forces could be one mechanism 245 by which the synergy site enables catch bond dynamics at the molecular scale . Moreover , we showed that the synergy site 246 contributed to conformational changes of 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin that has been hypothesized to result in downstream mechanosignaling 247 via focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation ( 13 , 24 , 35 ) . 248 In the context of outside - in signaling , the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN pivot - clip mechanism demonstrates how the synergy site may play a role 249 in moving both integrin heads , potentially leading to cell - scale changes . According to the outside - in activation model , integrins 250 maintain a bent - closed , low affinity state before undergoing a conformational change to an extended , active conformation 251 upon encountering an ECM ligand ( Figure 1A ) ( 46 – 48 ) . In contrast , the inside - out model proposes that the adaptor protein 252 talin would bind to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin , allowing it to activate and subsequently bind to its ligand ( 46 – 48 ) . While 253 the current hypothesis states that binding between FN and 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 triggers an opening of integrin’s cytoplasmic tails leading 254 to an accumulation of adaptor proteins that resist cell - matrix forces ( Figure 7A ) , further studies are needed to elucidate the 255 mechanism behind integrin activation . Multiple steered MD models have been employed to interrogate 𝛽 3 integrin activation 256 ( 22 , 43 , 49 – 52 ) , with few investigating the cytoplasmic end of 𝛽 1 integrin ( 53 , 54 ) . However , to our knowledge , our approach is 257 unique in that we model the interface between FN and the 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin heads , where forces interchange between the cell and 258 its matrix . 259 9 Our study acknowledges several limitations . Firstly , we made the assumption that the proximal ends of the integrin heads 260 were anchored by fully extended integrin legs tightly held by tails in the cell membrane . While this assumption contributed to 261 model stability , it is worth noting that the head - leg junction has been suggested to possess greater flexibility ( 13 ) . Relaxing the 262 constraints on the proximal ends to allow lateral movement may introduce flexibility without the added complexity of integrating 263 the legs . Secondly , our study applied a large , vertical pulling rate . While this approach is advantageous for directly stressing the 264 points of contact between FN and 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 , it is essential to recognize the need for changing the force vector to investigate other 265 potential loading states , such as shear or torsion . Lastly , our focus was on a specific integrin subtype . The intricate nature of 266 cell - matrix interactions involves multiple integrin subtypes and their respective ligands . Due to the prohibitive cost of molecular 267 dynamics simulations , alternative approaches such as coarse - grained or agent - based models , capable of examining cell - matrix 268 interactions at a broader systems level and over extended timescales , may be necessary . 269 CONCLUSION 270 This work advances our understanding of cell mechanobiology by introducing a mechanosensitive mechanism , termed pivot - clip , 271 by which 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 integrin reinforces cell adhesion . Through physics - based simulations , we shed light on a key biophysical 272 exchange between the cell and ECM that underpin many cellular behaviors that drive physiology and pathology . Critically , we 273 also demonstrated essential binding domains that promote catch bond dynamics in the context of cell - matrix mechanosensing . 274 Looking forward , we envision elucidating how the force - dependent , pivot - clip mechanism interacts with its surrounding 275 machinery and how it may be transformed via novel therapeutics . As our understanding of cell adhesion progresses , we aim to 276 develop informed approaches to target diseases that rely on transmitting forces via cell - matrix bonds . 277 Figure 7 : A ) 𝛼 5 𝛽 1 - FN bridges forces between the cell and matrix , supported by cytoplasmic adaptor proteins .
