Developing CNS neurons have a better regenerative ability , but lose this with maturity . This mini - review summarises recent ﬁ ndings which suggest one reason for regenerative failure is the selective distribution of growth machinery away from axons as CNS neurons mature . These studies demonstrate roles for the small GTPases ARF6 and Rab11 as intrinsic regulators of polarised transport and axon regeneration . ARF6 activation prevents the axonal transport of integrins in Rab11 endosomes in mature CNS axons . Decreasing ARF6 activation permits axonal transport , and increases regenerative ability . The ﬁ ndings suggest new targets for promoting axon regeneration after CNS injury . KEYWORDS ARF6 ; axon transport ; axon regeneration ; integrins ; polarised transport ; Rab11 ; spinal cord injury Selective polarised transport and axon regeneration Axons in the adult central nervous system ( CNS ) are particularly susceptible to injury and insult . This is exac - erbated by the fact that after they have been damaged , adult CNS neurons do not regenerate . Injuries to the brain and spinal cord can therefore have serious life changing consequences . Neurons are highly polarised cells with multiple dendrites and a single axon . In adult - hood , the axon propagates the action potential and releases neurotransmitters , whilst dendrites receive and process information from the numerous axonal termi - nals that synapse on them . For these diverse functions , axons and dendrites require different intracellular machinery . This demands precise delivery and / or reten - tion of the correct molecules to their required locations . Membrane protein targeting is particularly precise , being regulated by numerous signalling , traf ﬁ cking and trans - port pathways [ 1 ] . This ability of neurons to selectively transport the correct molecules to either axons or den - drites is termed selective polarised transport . Crucially , this process changes with development of the neuron . In developing neurons , the machinery required for axon growth is abundantly transported towards the tip of the growing axon – the growth cone . This includes numer - ous cell - surface membrane proteins such as growth fac - tor and guidance receptors , as well as the cytosolic machinery required for the growth process , including cytoskeletal machinery and accompanying regulatory molecules , and the traf ﬁ c and transport molecules required for membrane addition and reorganisation [ 2 ] . As neurons mature , the role of the axon changes towards electrical excitability and neurotransmission . Axon growth machinery is no longer required , and presynaptic membrane traf ﬁ cking processes become specialised for synaptic vesicle recycling and release ( exocytosis ) ( Figure 1 ) . It is now becoming apparent that one of the conse - quences of this developmental alteration in selective polarised transport is that adult CNS axons do not pos - sess suf ﬁ cient growth - enabling machinery for regenera - tion after an injury [ 3 , 4 ] . This may be one of the reasons that CNS axons are particularly vulnerable to insult and damage , and why injury to axons in the adult brain or spinal cord has such devastating consequences . Two recently published papers describe roles for Rab11 and ARF6 in the regulation of selective polarised transport and axon regeneration in mature CNS neurons [ 5 , 6 ] . ARF6 and Rab11 are small GTPases that regulate the traf ﬁ c and transport of recycling endosomes . The two papers demonstrate that as CNS axons mature , ARF6 functions to remove axon growth machinery ( integrins in Rab11 endosomes ) from axons , constraining it to the somato - dendritic domain .

Factors preventing axon regeneration after spinal cord injury There are a number of events that prevent repair after spinal cord injury , but essentially , axon regeneration fails for two key reasons : extrinsic inhibitory molecules pre - vent attempts at regrowth , and adult CNS axons have a poor intrinsic capacity for regeneration [ 7 , 8 ] . Axons descending from the brain through the corticospinal tract ( CST ) are responsible for voluntary motor control , so when these are injured , paralysis occurs . Research is therefore aimed at enabling CST axons to regenerate past the injury site to make new connections leading to restoration of motor function . An optimal repair strategy will enable CST axons to regenerate over long distances , and allow them to re - establish their correct connections . Injury to the spinal cord leads to the formation of the glial scar . During this process , a number of inhibitory molecules are laid down around the site of injury . These have been well characterised , and include myelin associ - ated molecules such as NogoA , MAG , and OMgp as well as astrocyte derived molecules such as the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans ( CSPGs ) . Targeting some of these inhibitory molecules has generated successful interven - tions that can stimulate axonal sprouting and plasticity leading to partial recovery of function , and these discov - eries are now progressing towards clinical treatments [ 9 , 10 ] . However , overcoming extrinsic inhibition has not led to long - range axon regrowth . More recent studies have therefore been aimed at increasing the axon ’ s intrinsic regenerative ability , and these have identi ﬁ ed signalling pathways and transcription factors that can be targeted to stimulate meaningful regeneration [ 8 , 11 – 13 ] , but these approaches have not enabled long - range regen - eration of CST axons past the site of injury . There are therefore continued efforts into identifying means of enabling robust axon regrowth of CST axons over long distances through the adult spinal cord . Integrins can enable long - range regeneration in the spinal cord Long - range regeneration is possible in the spinal cord , as has been demonstrated for sensory neurons regenerating their axons towards the brain . Sensory axons normally extend from the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) into the spinal cord to relay sensory information . Some sen - sory axons form synapses and terminate in the spinal cord , whilst others continue towards the brain to form connections in the medulla [ 14 ] . After an injury , sensory neurons can regenerate their axons but their growth is Figure 1 . Polarisation of cultured cortical neurons . Neurons undergo various developmental stages during polarisation . Genetic changes and selective transport of proteins contribute to neuronal polarisation . For simpli ﬁ cation purposes , two developmental stages are cate - gorized here . Developing cortical neurons exist in a growth state that promotes ﬁ rst axonal and then dendritic outgrowth . As neurons mature , there is a decline in their growth capacity as they become geared for neurotransmission . The neurons form an axon initial seg - ment that propagates the action potential and also contributes to polarised membrane protein transport . Mature cortical neurons have a poor intrinsic capacity for axon regeneration . 2 B . NIEUWENHUIS AND R . EVA usually halted by inhibitory molecules in the spinal cord , including the extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) molecule , tenascin - C . Long - range regeneration of sensory axons was enabled by virally transducing them with an integrin that recognises tenascin - C , alpha9beta1 [ 15 ] . Integrins are a complex family of hetero - dimeric cell surface receptors which recognise molecules within the ECM governed by their alpha - beta combinations [ 16 ] . Integ - rins mediate guided CNS axon growth during develop - ment and in the PNS they can drive axon regeneration after injury [ 17 , 18 ] . Viral expression of alpha9 integrin together with its activator kindlin - 1 endows sensory axons with the ability to ignore inactivation by inhibitory molecules , leading to robust regeneration from the level of the forelimb to the medulla . This method enables re - establishment of connections within the spinal cord , leading to functional sensory recovery [ 15 ] . The approach works because PNS axons ef ﬁ ciently transport integrins , allowing them to guide axon regeneration from the axon surface . The strategy could be used to enable regeneration of descending motor axons in the CST , but crucially , integrins are restricted from these axons . Endogenous integrins are not transported into adult CNS axons , being found in dendrites and the cell body [ 19 , 20 ] , and viral delivery of alpha9 integrin into adult CNS neurons similarly allows transport of integrins into dendrites but not into axons [ 3 ] . Importantly , integ - rins are transported into immature , developing axons in the CNS , and these axons have a greater regenerative capacity . It is therefore likely that the restriction of integrins from adult CNS axons contributes to their inability to regenerate . The papers described in this review were aimed at understanding the mechanisms controlling axo - nal integrin traf ﬁ c and transport , with a view to identify - ing means of directing integrins into mature CNS axons . The authors reasoned that this might raise their regener - ative ability . Additionally , it might also mean that the integrin method which enables robust sensory regenera - tion through the spinal cord could be applied to the CST axons that control motor function . It should also clarify whether the CNS blockade of integrin axon transport contributes to regenerative failure . Rab11 and ARF6 Previous studies on integrin traf ﬁ c in PNS axons found that integrins are transported in recycling endosomes controlled by the small GTPases , Rab11 and ARF6 . Rab11 targets integrins to the axonal growth cone sur - face , and functions at the growth cone to regulate integ - rin recycling [ 21 ] , whilst ARF6 controls the direction of axonal integrin transport [ 22 ] . Active ARF6 stimulates retrograde transport , whereas inactive ARF6 allows anterograde transport . In PNS axons , integrins are ef ﬁ - ciently transported and move bi - directionally , but in mature CNS axons they are removed by predominant retrograde transport controlled by mechanisms involving ARF6 activation and the axon initial segment [ 20 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Rab11 and ARF6 have overlapping and distinct roles in the regulation of membrane protein traf ﬁ ck - ing through recycling endosomes . Rab11 was origi - nally identi ﬁ ed as a regulator of traf ﬁ c from recycling endosomes towards the cell surface via the peri - nuclear recycling centre [ 23 ] . Subsequently it was found that Rab11 is also involved in more rapid forms of localised recycling such as the high capacity turn - over of membrane proteins that is observed in migrating cells [ 24 ] , as well as being involved in a wider range of traf ﬁ cking pathways , including exocy - tosis [ 25 ] . It ’ s role in axon growth is now well accepted , being responsible for the transport and recycling of integrins and TrkA in PNS axons and growth cones [ 21 , 26 ] as well as having a developmen - tal role in the CNS , where it is involved in the regu - lated insertion of guidance receptors when developing axons cross the ventral midline of the spinal cord [ 27 ] . Importantly , Rab11 appears to be essential for growth cone function because its targeted removal ( by optogenetics ) leads to growth cone collapse [ 28 ] . It is also known to regulate the traf ﬁ cking of a num - ber of molecules which can stimulate axon growth in addition to integrins and Trk receptors , including the EGF , IGF and FGF receptors [ 29 - 31 ] and the pro - regenerative reggie / ﬂ otillin molecules [ 32 ] ( Table 1 ) . In addition to these molecules , Rab11 also regulates the process of neurite outgrowth by supply the mate - rials required for neurite extension through interac - tions with other Rab proteins such as Rabs 8 and Rab10 [ 33 ] . ARF6 also regulates endocytic traf ﬁ c through the recycling pathway , and is additionally involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphoino - sitide signalling . As it has very low intrinsic GTPase activity , ARF6 is strongly reliant on its GAPs and GEFs for regulation of nucleotide cycling [ 34 ] . ARF6 and its regulatory molecules have been closely linked to the control of integrin traf ﬁ c and function , regulat - ing integrin traf ﬁ c in migrating and invasive cells , as well as controlling the function of integrin adhesion complexes [ 35 ] . Our own early studies found a role for ARF6 in the regulation of integrin traf ﬁ c in PNS axons , and other work has demonstrated a role for ARF6 in the regulation of developmental axon growth in CNS neurons , partly as a result of signalling SMALL GTPASES 3 through phosphoinositides [ 36 ] ( Table 2 ) . ARF6 also plays a clearly de ﬁ ned role in the regulation of neu - rite outgrowth in PC12 cells [ 37 ] , as well as regulat - ing the migration of neurons in the cerebral cortex during development functioning via the ARF6 and Rab11 effector ( FIP3 ) / Arfophilin - 1 [ 38 ] . ARF6 also functions ( in its active , GTP - bound state ) in adult CNS neurons to limit axon growth by its ability to remove integrins from axons via retro - grade transport , because overcoming this process increases developmental axon length [ 20 ] . It is likely that the control of directional transport within axons occurs through an interaction of ARF6 with the JIP3 / 4 scaffold molecules , although this has not been dem - onstrated in neurons . The ARF6 JIP3 / 4 interaction has been shown to control the direction of endosomal transport during cytokinesis , with ARF6 - GTP increas - ing the af ﬁ nity of JIP3 / 4 for the dynein / dynactin complex , leading to retrograde transport , whilst ARF6 - GDP favours interactions with kinesin allowing anterograde transport along microtubules . This occurs in a complex involving both ARF6 and Rab11 [ 39 ] . In summary , Rab11 and ARF6 are recycling endo - some markers that regulate integrin traf ﬁ c and func - tion and as well as developmental axon growth ( Figure 2 , and Tables 1 and 2 ) . Rab11 and axon regeneration To investigate whether Rab11 and ARF6 are involved in the regulation of axon regeneration in mature CNS axons , we established an in vitro model for studying axon regeneration [ 6 ] . The in vitro laser axotomy model provides a platform for the identi ﬁ cation and validation of potential axon regeneration targets that could be taken forward for investigation in animal models of spinal cord injury . Rat cortical neurons were cultured to maturity ( up to 24 days in vitro ( DIV ) ) with an astrocyte feeder layer . This type of culture has been used before to inves - tigate changes that occur during neuronal polarisation [ 40 ] , but not in the context of axon regeneration . The cell cultures were validated by measuring electrical activ - ity and gene changes at 4 , 8 , 16 and 24 DIV . The neurons underwent a developmental change in gene expression , Figure 2 .

Active , GTP - bound ARF6 / Rab11 stimulate retrograde transport via dyneins , whilst GDP bound ARF6 / Rab11 favours anterograde transport via kinesin motors . Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , such as ARNO and EFA6 , activate GTPases by exchanging GDP for GTP and thereby promote retrograde transport .

EVA showing an increase in genes involved in synapse forma - tion , and exhibited increased electrical activity as the neurons matured . Importantly , ingenuity pathway analysis also revealed there was a decline in develop - ment - associated genes over time ( see also Figure 1 ) . To measure the intrinsic axon regeneration capacity , we used in vitro laser axotomy , which allows precise sever - ing of individual axons . This con ﬁ rmed that regenerative capacity declined in line with maturity [ 6 ] . We then used this in vitro model of regenerative decline to investigate a role for Rab11 in CNS axon regeneration . Our hypothe - sis was that the developmental decline in regenerative ability might be due to changes in selective polarised transport which restrict post - synaptic molecules to the somato - dendritic domain , limiting the molecules enter - ing the axon . A number of studies have demonstrated that Rab11 is an important dendritic , post - synaptic mol - ecule , being responsible for AMPA receptor recycling Table 1 .

Rab11 - positive - endosomes carry many cell - surface receptors that are important for axonal regeneration ( Table 1 ) , but has a somato - dendritic distri - bution in adult brain in vivo [ 42 ] . This was found to be the same in mature neurons in vitro . Importantly , Rab11 is present in equal amounts in axons and dendrites at an early stage ( 4 DIV ) , but by 16 DIV it is principally found in the cell body and dendrites , with low levels present in axons . To determine if this de ﬁ cit of axonal Rab11 con - tributes to regenerative decline , we overexpressed Rab11 and measured its effects on axon regeneration . Overex - pressed Rab11 is mis - traf ﬁ cked into axons , indicating that the mechanism involved in restricting Rab11 to den - drites and the cell body is to a certain extent “ leaky ” after gene overexpression . Overexpression of Rab11 increased the regeneration potential and length of cortical neurons after laser axotomy . Importantly , overexpressing Rab11 also led to an increase in the amount of integrins present in axons , suggesting that increasing axonal Rab11 enhan - ces regenerative capacity partly by providing the axon with regenerative machinery ( integrins ) . This study dem - onstrated that cortical neurons can be used to investigate the intrinsic decline in axon regeneration ability that occurs with maturation in the CNS , and that the decline is partly due to the axonal exclusion of growth - promot - ing machinery in Rab11 endosomes . ARF6 and axon regeneration ARF6 and Rab11 have overlapping and distinct roles , sometimes functioning as a complex [ 39 ] , whist still being capable of regulating different subcellular events . This is the case in CNS neurons , because whilst ARF6 and Rab11 cooperate in the regulation of axonal integrin traf ﬁ c , they also localise differently . Rab11 adopts a mainly somato - dendritic localisation , and functions principally in the post - synapse , whilst ARF6 appears to be uniformly distributed between axons and dendrites [ 20 ] , having roles in both the pre - and post - synaptic compartments [ 43 , 44 ] . Our earlier studies found that ARF6 activation can control the direction of axonal integrin transport , and that two seemingly distinct mech - anisms involving ARF6 activation and the axon initial segment ( AIS ) are responsible for the retrograde removal of integrins from mature CNS axons [ 20 ] . We reasoned that the two mechanisms might be linked , and the pres - ence of an ARF6 GEF in the AIS would unite them . Looking again in cultured cortical neurons , we found that the ARF6 GEF EFA6 localises to the AIS as neurons mature , being undetectable at early time points but strongly enriched by 14 DIV onwards [ 5 ] . Our hypothe - sis was that EFA6 might be responsible for the retrograde removal of integrins from axons through axonal ARF6 activation . If this was the case , targeting EFA6 might facilitate integrin and / or Rab11 transport into axons ( through the known interaction of Rab11 with ARF6 ) , and this could subsequently enhance the axon ’ s regener - ative ability . To investigate whether EFA6 was activating ARF6 in the AIS we measured ARF activation using a GST tagged probe that binds only to active ARF ( the ARF - binding domain of GGA3 fused to a GST tag ) . ARF protein activation was not restricted to the AIS , but was strongly present throughout the axon . Importantly , this was not evident earlier in development , when integrins and Rab11 are transported into axons . Silencing EFA6 sharply reduced axonal ARF activation , indicating that EFA6 activates ARF6 in mature CNS axons . The decreased ARF activation mediated by silencing EFA6 led to a decrease in retrograde transport and a substantial increase in anterograde axonal integrin transport . Cru - cially , silencing EFA6 also led to an increase in Rab11 endosomes in axons , most likely because Rab11 and ARF6 cooperate to control the direction of endosomal transport through interaction with scaffolds and motor proteins ( although this remains to be tested in neurons ) . EFA6 therefore functions to remove axon growth machinery ( integrins in Rab11 endosomes ) from CNS axons as they mature . To address whether this contributes to the matura - tional decline in regenerative capacity , we used the laser axotomy model to injure axons of neurons in which EFA6 had been silenced . Knockdown of EFA6 led to a substantial increase in regeneration after laser axotomy , suggesting that the GEF EFA6 contributes to the axon ’ s poor regenerative ability . The ﬁ ndings suggest that ARF6 is an intrinsic regulator of regeneration , governed by its activation state . To investigate this idea further , experi - ments were performed to test whether increasing ARF6 activation would prevent PNS neurons from regenerat - ing their axons after a laser injury . Adult dorsal root gan - glia ( DRG ) neurons are sensory , PNS neurons with a superior regenerative ability compared to adult CNS neurons . As DRGs have a relatively good regeneration capacity , the hypothesis was that they either expressed less EFA6 than CNS neurons or that EFA6 is differently localised . Surprisingly , EFA6 was found at high levels in adult DRG neurons , although it was not enriched in the axon . Furthermore , PNS ARF6 activation was found to be counterbalanced by an ARF6 GAP that is not present in CNS neurons , ACAP1 . Overexpressing EFA6 in DRG neurons resulted in expression throughout the axon , which led to a strong reduction in regeneration after laser injury . Expressing the ARF6 activation - incompe - tent EFA6 ( EFA6 E242K ) caused a much smaller reduc - tion in regeneration . This further suggests that EFA6 6 B . NIEUWENHUIS AND R . EVA opposes regeneration , functioning mostly through acti - vation of ARF6 . Taking the results from the experiments in CNS and PNS neurons together , we conclude that ARF6 activation state is an intrinsic determinant of regenerative capacity . Discussion – implications and future research Overall , the two papers described suggest that ARF6 and Rab11 are both intrinsic regulators of regenerative capac - ity , and that a supply of growth promoting machinery in recycling endosomes is an important pre - requisite for re - establishing a growth cone which can enable vigorous axon growth . The cellular mechanisms required for growth cone development and axon growth have been well characterised , but it is not understood why these cannot be recapitulated after an injury to enable axon regeneration [ 45 ] . Investigations into the intrinsic mech - anisms regulating axon regeneration have so far focused on upstream signalling molecules and transcription fac - tors that can be targeted to facilitate regeneration . These have identi ﬁ ed signalling through the PI3 kinase / PTEN pathway [ 46 ] and cytokine signalling pathways [ 47 ] , and transcription factors such as sox11 [ 48 ] and KLF7 [ 13 ] . These pathways enhance regeneration through regulation of either transcription or translation , but importantly , it is not known how this results in axon growth . In other words , the downstream cellular mecha - nisms involved in mediating the actions of these regener - ative interventions have not been characterised in detail . Our studies indicate that an ef ﬁ cient supply of axonal growth machinery is a critical factor determining an axon ’ s regenerative ability . It will be important to dis - cover whether axon transport is a mechanism that is involved downstream of any of the known regeneration interventions described above . One pathway that is likely to function through the mobilisation of growth machinery is the PI3K / PTEN pathway . The tumour suppressor PTEN was identi ﬁ ed as in intrinsic inhibitor of CNS regeneration almost 10 years ago [ 46 ] , and subsequent studies have demonstrated that it is part of an important pathway controlling the regen - erative capacity of both spinal cord and optic nerve axons . PTEN and PI3K transduce the actions of growth factor receptors and integrins . PI3K and PTEN therefore regulate two key signalling molecules , PIP 2 and PIP 3 . PI3K generates the phosphatidylinositol PIP 3 from PIP 2 , whilst PTEN converts PIP 3 back to PIP 2 . Importantly , the complete mechanisms through which PTEN deletion promotes regeneration have yet to be fully characterised . One possibility is that PTEN may function partly by sig - nalling via ARF6 . The majority of ARF6 GEFs and GAPs are regulated either directly by PIP 2 or PIP 3 , or by phosphorylation by kinases acting downstream of these phosphoinositides [ 49 – 51 ] . EFA6 is a good example of an ARF6 GEF that acts downstream of PI3K / PTEN , because it is strongly activated by PIP 2 [ 52 ] . It remains to be seen whether elevating PI3K activity and therefore levels of PIP 3 can overcome the activity of EFA6 ( by con - verting PIP 2 to PIP 3 ) to promote axonal transport , but there is evidence that axonal signalling through PI3K can lead to increased anterograde transport of growth factor receptors in a feed forward fashion [ 53 ] . Further work is needed to ascertain whether EFA6 is a valid target for enhancing regeneration after a CNS axo - nal injury . To begin with it will be necessary to deter - mine whether knock - down of EFA6 can enable integrin or Rab11 axonal transport into CNS axon in vivo . If this is the case , then it may be possible to apply the integrin method , ( which has been used to promote sensory regen - eration in the spinal cord [ 15 ] ) , in conjunction with EFA6 silencing , to achieve the goal of long - range regen - eration of CST axons after a spinal cord injury . Alterna - tively , it may be necessary to intervene in additional ways , such as the overexpression of ARF6 GAPs , in order to overcome the predominant retrograde axonal trans - port which prevents an axonal integrin presence . Careful in vivo experiments are necessary to identify the optimal intervention for enabling integrin and Rab11 transport into mature CNS axons in animal models of CNS axonal injury .
