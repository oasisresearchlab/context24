In this study , we evaluated the effects of a sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations induced by a receptor - bypassed stimulation with ionomycin , a Ca 2 + ionophore , on the endocytosis and down - regulation of H 1 receptors in Chinese hamster ovary cells . All cellular and cell - surface H 1 receptors were detected by the binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine to intact cells sensitive to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic H 1 receptor ligands , mepyramine and pirdonium , respectively . The pretreatment of cells with ionomycin markedly reduced the mepyramine - and pirdonium - sensitive binding sites of [ 3 H ] mepyramine , which were com - pletely abrogated by the deprivation of extracellular Ca 2 + and partially by a ubiquitin - activating enzyme inhibitor ( UBEI - 41 ) , but were not affected by inhibitors of calmodulin ( W - 7 or calmidazolium ) and protein kinase C ( chelerythrine or GF109203X ) . These ionomycin - induced changes were also not affected by inhibitors of receptor endocytosis via clathrin ( hypertonic sucrose ) and caveolae / lipid rafts ( ﬁ lipin or nystatin ) or by inhibitors of lysosomes ( E - 64 , leupeptin , chloroquine , or NH 4 Cl ) , proteasomes ( lactacystin or MG - 132 ) , and a Ca 2 + - dependent non - lysosomal cysteine protease ( calpain ) ( MDL28170 ) . Since H 1 receptors were normally detected by confocal immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy with an antibody against H 1 receptors , even after the ionomycin treatment , H 1 receptors appeared to exist in a form to which [ 3 H ] mepyramine was unable to bind . These results suggest that H 1 receptors are apparently down - regulated by a sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations with no process of endocy - tosis and lysosomal / proteasomal degradation of receptors .

G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , which possess seven transmembrane domains , form the largest plasma membrane receptor family and play crucial roles in the regulation of cellular responses ( Lefkowitz 2007 ) . When stimulated with agonists , GPCRs undergo G protein - coupled receptor kinase / arrestin - mediated internalization ( endocytosis ) and subse - quent down - regulation for cellular homeostasis ( Reiter and Lefkowitz 2006 ; Tian et al . 2014 ; Gurevich and Gurevich 2015 ; Smith and Rajagopal 2016 ) : the internalization of receptors , that is , moving from the cell surface via the formation of endosomes into an intracellular compartment inaccessible to hydrophilic extracellular ligands , involves clathrin - or caveolae / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis ( Mun - dell et al . 2006 ; Puthenveedu and von Zastrow 2006 ; Lajoie and Nabi 2007 ; Wolfe and Trejo 2007 ; Gong et al . 2008 ; Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow 2008 ) . The down - regulation of receptors , which is assessed by the loss of cellular binding sites for cell - penetrating hydrophobic ligands , generally involves the degradation of receptors via lysosomes or Received February 20 , 2017 ; revised manuscript received September 27 , 2017 ; accepted October 17 , 2017 .

The ubiquitination of receptors is known to be involved in their internalization and down - regulation pro - cesses ( Shenoy 2007 ; Marchese and Trejo 2013 ; Kennedy and Marchese 2015 ) . Histamine H 1 receptors are G q / 11 protein - coupled and Ca 2 + - mobilizing receptors , exist throughout the human body , and play roles in allergy and in ﬂ ammation in peripheral tissues and arousal in the central nervous system ( Hill 1990 ; Bakker et al . 2002 ; Monczor and Fernandez 2016 ) . We have been investigating the regulatory mechanisms of human histamine H 1 receptors , particularly those responsible for the agonist - induced internalization and down - regulation of H 1 receptors , since we demonstrated the ﬁ rst evidence for histamine - induced internalization of H 1 receptors in human astrocytoma cells ( Hishinuma and Young 1995 ) . We previ - ously reported that the agonist - induced internalization of H 1 receptors was transiently inhibited by Ca 2 + / calmodulin ( Hishinuma et al . 1998 ) , during which the af ﬁ nity of agonists for cell - surface H 1 receptors was dually regulated by Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II and protein phosphatase 2B ( calcineurin ) in human astrocytoma cells ( Hishinuma and Ogura 2000 ) . Furthermore , we found that cell - surface H 1 receptors internalize in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells stimulated with agonists via clathrin - dependent , but caveolae / lipid raft - independent endocytosis , which is a pre - requisite process for the subsequent down - regulation of H 1 receptors via the prompt and protein kinase C / ubiquitin / proteasome - dependent degradation pathway as well as the slow and lysosome - dependent degradation pathway ( Hishinuma et al . 2010 ) . Thus , the agonist - induced internalization and down - regulation of H 1 receptors appear to be tightly regulated by intracellular Ca 2 + signaling activated by H 1 receptors . Since agonist - induced increases in intracel - lular Ca 2 + concentrations were transient ( Hishinuma and Ogura 2000 ) , we were prompted to examine how the internalization and down - regulation of H 1 receptors may be modulated by a sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations . Ionomycin , a Ca 2 + ionophore , promptly equilibrates intracellular and extracellular Ca 2 + , so that ionomycin induces rapid and sustained changes in intracel - lular Ca 2 + concentrations up to concentrations equivalent to extracellular Ca 2 + ( Sato et al . 1988 ) . We herein present our novel results showing that ionomycin induced the Ca 2 + - dependent down - regulation of H 1 receptors without the apparent internalization of H 1 receptors and their lysosomal / proteasomal degradation .

The study was not pre - registered and neither randomization nor blinding was performed . CHO cells stably expressing transfected human histamine H 1 receptors or human U373 MG astrocytoma cells natively expressing histamine H 1 receptors were cultured in 150 - cm 2 culture ﬂ asks , as described previously ( Hishinuma et al . 2010 , 2012 ) . Dissociated cells were suspended in normal HEPES buffer ( in mM ; NaCl 120 , KCl 5 . 4 , MgCl 2 1 . 6 , CaCl 2 1 . 8 , D - glucose 11 and HEPES 25 , pH 7 . 4 at 37 ° C ) or in normal HEPES buffer but with various concentrations of CaCl 2 ( 0 . 1 l M to 1 . 0 mM ) and kept at 37 ° C for 30 min for equilibration . In experiments to evaluate the effects of hypertonic or Ca 2 + - free conditions , dissociated cells were suspended in hypertonic HEPES buffer ( 0 . 32 M sucrose was added to normal HEPES buffer ) or Ca 2 + - free HEPES buffer ( CaCl 2 was omitted from normal HEPES buffer and 0 . 2 mM EGTA was added ) . Treatment of cells with ionomycin Cells ( approximately 5 9 10 6 cells / mL ) were incubated without ( control ) or with 10 l M ionomycin at 37 ° C for 30 min in normal HEPES buffer in the presence or absence of test compounds or in hypertonic or Ca 2 + - free HEPES buffer . In experiments aimed to evaluate the effects of various concentrations of Ca 2 + , cells were incubated without ( control ) or with 10 l M ionomycin in normal HEPES buffer but with various concentrations of CaCl 2 ( 0 . 1 l M to 1 . 0 mM ) .

Measurement of [ 3 H ] mepyramine binding to histamine H 1 receptors The binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine , a cell - penetrant radioligand for H 1 receptors , to all cellular and cell - surface H 1 receptors was detected , using mepyramine and pirdonium ( a hydrophilic H 1 receptor ligand with a permanently charged quaternary ammonium group ) , respec - tively ( Hishinuma et al . 2016 ) .

In subsequent experiments , control and ionomycin - treated cells were incubated with 5 nM [ 3 H ] mepyramine in the presence or absence of 10 l M mepyramine or 2 l M pirdonium for 24 h at 4 ° C . The actual concentration of [ 3 H ] mepyramine was assessed by measuring an aliquot of [ 3 H ] mepyramine / HEPES medium . The reaction mixture was washed by suspending twice in 3 mL ice - cold medium and centrifuging at 220 g for 5 min . In experiments to evaluate the direct effects of Ca 2 + on the [ 3 H ] mepyramine binding to H 1 receptors , membranes were prepared from ionomycin - non - treated cells and incubated with 0 . 1 – 10 nM [ 3 H ] mepyramine in the presence or absence of 10 l M mepyramine in 25 mM HEPES buffer simply containing either 0 . 2 mM EGTA ( control ) or 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 according to the methods described previously ( Hishinuma et al . 2014 ) . The cell suspension or the membrane preparation was ﬁ ltered through Whatman GF / B glass ﬁ ber ﬁ lters ( pre - soaked for at least 3 h in 0 . 3 % polyethylenimine ) , using a 24 - place cell harvester ( Brandel , Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) . The ﬁ lters were transferred to scintillation vial inserts and a 3 - mL scintillator was added before the assessment of tritium by scintil - lation counting . All measurements were performed in quadruplicate . Detection of histamine H 1 receptors using confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy CHO cells stably expressing human histamine H 1 receptors tagged with three molecules of HA : YPYDVPDYA at the N terminus ( Hishinuma et al . 2016 ) were cultured on glass coverslips in six - well plates and treated without ( control ) or with 10 l M ionomycin or 0 . 1 mM histamine at 37 ° C for 30 min in normal HEPES buffer . These cells were ﬁ xed with phosphate - buffered saline containing 3 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with phos - phate - buffered saline containing 0 . 1 % Triton - X - 100 and 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin for 10 min . Cells were then labeled with primary antibodies against HA at 4 ° C overnight to detect histamine H 1 receptors and then labeled with Alexa - Fluor - 488 - conjugated secondary antibodies at 37 ° C for 30 min . Confocal immuno ﬂ uo - rescence microscopy was performed using a laser scanning micro - scope ( LSM710 ; Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . Measurement of histamine - induced accumulation of [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates Histamine - induced accumulation of [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates was measured as described previously ( Hishinuma et al . 2016 ) . Brie ﬂ y , cells were cultured on 10 - cm dishes and incubated with 0 . 12 l M myo - [ 3 H ] inositol ( 2 . 5 l Ci / mL ) for 24 h at 37 ° C . Cells were dissociated and treated without ( control ) or with 10 l M ionomycin at 37 ° C for 30 min in normal HEPES buffer before stimulation without ( basal ) or with the indicated concentrations of histamine for 30 min at 37 ° C in Krebs - Henseleit buffer ( in mM : NaCl 116 , KCl 4 . 7 , MgSO 4 1 . 2 , CaCl 2 2 . 5 , KH 2 PO 4 1 . 2 , NaHCO 3 25 and D - glucose 11 ; pH 7 . 4 ) containing 30 mM LiCl . [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates accumulated within the cells were collected with an AG 1 - X8 anion - exchange column and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting . All determinations were performed in quadruplicate . Measurement of changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations with an intracellular Ca 2 + indicator , fura 2 - AM Changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations were measured as described previously ( Hishinuma and Ogura 2000 ) . Brie ﬂ y , cells were grown on 35 - mm glass - bottom dishes and incubated with 1 l M fura 2 - AM and 0 . 02 % Cremophor (cid:1) EL for 60 min in the dark at room temperature ( approximately 25 ° C ) . The fura 2 - AM - loaded cells were stimulated with 0 . 1 mM histamine or 10 l M ionomycin in normal HEPES buffer before treatment with 10 mM EGTA . Fluorescence of the cells at an emission wavelength of 500 nm after excitation at 340 and 380 nm ( F 340 and F 380 , respectively ) and the ratio ( F 340 / F 380 ) was monitored with a ﬂ uorescence microscope ( IX71 ; Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) and a Ca 2 + imaging software ( MetaMorph ; Molecular Devices , Tokyo , Japan ) . Data analysis Results are presented as the mean (cid:1) SEM . The signi ﬁ cance of differences was evaluated by the Student ’ s t - test or ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections ( KaleidaGraph ; Synergy Software , Read - ing , PA , USA ) . A value of p < 0 . 05 was considered to be signi ﬁ cant . In initial saturation experiments , the number of [ 3 H ] mepyra - mine binding to all cellular and cell - surface histamine H 1 receptors was assessed by ﬁ tting the mepyramine - and pirdo - nium - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine to a hyperbola ( KaleidaGraph ) : B ¼ B max (cid:3) C = ð C þ K d Þ ; where B is the amount bound , B max is the maximum amount bound , C is the concentration of [ 3 H ] mepyramine , and K d is the dissociation constant for [ 3 H ] mepyramine binding to the H 1 receptor . Two binding curves were evaluated in parallel in each experiment . In subsequent experiments , B max was simply estimated from the mepyramine - and pirdonium - sensitive binding of 5 nM [ 3 H ] mepyramine . The ionomycin - induced loss of the binding sites of [ 3 H ] mepyramine to all cellular and cell - surface H 1 receptors was assessed from percentage reductions in B max for the mepyramine - and pirdonium - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine , respectively , from that for control cells ( no ionomycin treatment ) measured in the same experiment . Time - course curves for ionomycin - induced reductions in B max values for the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine were ﬁ t to the exponential function ( KaleidaGraph ) : B max ¼ R max (cid:3) exp ð(cid:4) 0 : 69 t = t 1 = 2 Þ þ ð 100 (cid:4) R max Þ ; where t 1 / 2 represents the time required for a half - maximal percentage reduction in B max for the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine to treated cells from that in control cells . R max represents the maximum extent of the loss of the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine . Concentration - response curves for ionomycin - induced reductions in B max values for the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine in the presence of various concentrations of Ca 2 + were ﬁ t to the following equation ( KaleidaGraph ) : © 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry , J .

B max ¼ ð E max (cid:4) E min Þ (cid:3) EC 50 n = ð C n þ EC 50 n Þ þ E min ; where E max is the maximal B max value , E min is the minimal B max value , EC 50 is the effective concentration of Ca 2 + to induce a half - maximal percentage reduction in B max values , C is the concentration of Ca 2 + , and n is the slope factor . Concentration - response curves for the histamine - induced accu - mulation of [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates were ﬁ t to a Hill equa - tion ( KaleidaGraph ) : Response ¼ 100 þ ð Resp max (cid:3) C n Þ = ð C n þ EC 50 n Þ ; where Resp max is the maximal response of the histamine - induced accumulation of [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates , C is the concentration of histamine , n is the Hill coef ﬁ cient , and EC 50 is the effective concentration of histamine to induce a half - maximal response . Results Ionomycin - induced increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration Figure 1 shows representative changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations induced by 0 . 1 mM histamine , 10 l M iono - mycin and 10 mM EGTA , which were monitored as changes in the ratio ( F 340 / F 380 ) in fura 2 - AM - loaded CHO cells . Histamine induced a transient increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations , whereas ionomycin induced a larger and sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations than histamine . The ionomycin - induced increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations was promptly reduced by removal of extracellular Ca 2 + with EGTA . Thus , ionomycin induced a rapid and sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentra - tions in a manner dependent on extracellular Ca 2 + . Ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites Figure 2 shows representative saturation curves for the mepyramine ( a ) - and pirdonium ( b ) - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine to intact CHO cells treated without ( control ; open circle ) or with ( closed circle ) 10 l M ionomycin at 37 ° C for 30 min . Estimated B max values for the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine were reduced by the treatment with ionomycin from 477 (cid:1) 21 to 126 (cid:1) 7 fmol / mg whole cell protein with no change in the estimated K d values of [ 3 H ] mepyramine for mepyramine - sensitive sites ( 0 . 44 (cid:1) 0 . 03 nM for control cells and 0 . 39 (cid:1) 0 . 06 nM for ionomycin - treated cells ) ( n = 3 ) . Estimated B max values for the pirdonium - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine were also reduced by the treatment with ionomycin from 374 (cid:1) 20 to 114 (cid:1) 5 fmol / mg whole cell protein with no changes in the estimated K d values of [ 3 H ] mepyramine for pirdonium - sensitive sites ( 0 . 33 (cid:1) 0 . 03 nM for control cells and 0 . 34 (cid:1) 0 . 06 nM for ionomycin - treated cells ) ( n = 3 ) . Thus , [ 3 H ] mepyramine binding to all cellular and cell - surface H 1 receptors was reduced by the treatment with ionomycin . These results suggest that the down - regulation of H 1 receptors was concomitantly induced by ionomycin with a loss in cell - surface H 1 receptors . Figure 2 ( c ) shows time - course curves for ionomycin - induced reductions in B max values for the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine in CHO cells ( open circle ) and human U373 MG astrocytoma cells ( closed circle ) : Values for the maximal reduction and t 1 / 2 were 85 (cid:1) 4 % and 3 . 6 (cid:1) 0 . 6 min in CHO cells and 97 (cid:1) 9 % and 25 . 6 (cid:1) 3 . 8 min in astrocytoma cells , respectively . Thus , the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors occurred in astrocytoma cells natively expressing H 1 recep - tors as well as in CHO cells stably expressing transfected human H 1 receptors . In subsequent experiments , we exam - ined the mechanisms responsible for the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors in CHO cells . Involvement of receptor endocytosis in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites We evaluated the involvement of receptor endocytosis in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites in intact CHO cells ( Fig . 3 ) . Ionomycin - induced reductions in the mepyramine ( a and c ) - and pirdonium ( b and d ) - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine were not affected under hypertonic conditions containing 0 . 32 M sucrose ( a and b ) , in which clathrin - dependent endocytosis is known to be inhibited ( Heuser and Anderson 1989 ; 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 R a t i o ( F 340 / F 380 ) Time ( min ) Histamine Ionomycin EGTA Fig . 1 Changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations induced by histamine , ionomycin and EGTA in fura 2 - AM - loaded Chinese hamster ovary cells .

Fluorescence of the cells at an emission wavelength of 500 nm after excitation at 340 nm ( F 340 ) and 380 nm ( F 380 ) was measured with a ﬂ uorescence microscope . Changes in the ratio ( F 340 / F 380 ) were monitored as relative changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations . Experiments were performed three times ( n = 3 ) with similar results . © 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry , J . Neurochem .

These results suggest that the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors occurred without receptor endocytosis via clathrin and caveolae / lipid rafts . Involvement of lysosomes and proteasomes in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites We investigated the involvement of lysosomes and proteasomes in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyra - mine - binding sites in intact CHO cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Ionomycin - induced reductions in the mepyramine ( a , c and e ) - and pirdonium ( b , d and f ) - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine were affected by neither lysosomal protease inhibitors ( a – d ; 0 . 1 mM E - 64 , 0 . 1 mM leupeptin , 0 . 1 mM chloroquine , and 10 mM NH 4 Cl ) ( Aoyagi et al . 1969 ; de Duve et al . 1974 ) nor proteasome inhibitors ( e and f ; 10 l M lactacystin and 50 l M MG - 132 ) ( Fenteany et al . 1995 ; Tsubuki et al . 1996 ; Kisselev and Goldberg 2001 ) . These results suggest that the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors was not caused by receptor degradation via lysosomes and protea - somes . Involvement of Ca 2 + signaling in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites We examined the involvement of Ca 2 + signaling in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites in intact CHO cells ( Fig . 5 ) . Ionomycin - induced reductions in the mepyramine ( a , c and e ) - and pirdonium ( b , d and f ) - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine were completely inhibited under Ca 2 + - free conditions ( a and b ) , but not by calmodulin inhibitors ( c and d ; 0 . 1 mM W - 7 and 10 l M calmidazolium ) ( Tanaka 1988 ; Agullo and Garcia 1997 ) or protein kinase C inhibitors ( e and f ; 3 l M chelerythrine and 100 nM GF109203X ) ( Herbert et al . 1990 ; Martiny - Baron et al . 1993 ) .

Involvement of calpain and ubiquitin - activating enzyme ( E1 ) in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites We then evaluated the involvement of calpain , a calcium - dependent and non - lysosomal cysteine protease , and a ubiquitin - activating enzyme ( E1 ) , which catalyzes the ﬁ rst step of the ubiquitination of proteins , in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites in intact CHO cells ( Fig . 6 ) .

These results suggest that the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites involved receptor modi ﬁ - cations via ubiquitination in part , but not by receptor degradation via calpain . 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control Ionomycin Hypertonic Ionomycin + Hypertonic M ep y r a m i ne - s en s i t i v e b i nd i ng o f [ 3 H ] m ep y r a m i ne ( % o f c on t r o l ) * * * * * * 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control Ionomycin Hypertonic Ionomycin + Hypertonic P i r don i u m - s en s i t i v e b i nd i ng o f [ 3 H ] m ep y r a m i ne ( % o f c on t r o l ) * * * * * * 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control Ionomycin Ionomycin + Filipin Ionomycin + Nystatin M ep y r a m i ne - s en s i t i v e b i nd i ng o f [ 3 H ] m ep y r a m i ne ( % o f c on t r o l ) * * * * * * * * * 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control Ionomycin Ionomycin + Filipin Ionomycin + Nystatin P i r don i u m - s en s i t i v e b i nd i ng o f [ 3 H ] m ep y r a m i ne ( % o f c on t r o l ) * * * * * * * * * ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Fig . 3 Involvement of receptor endocytosis in the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites .

( 2018 ) 144 , 68 - - 80 Down - regulation of histamine H 1 receptor 75 Ca 2 + dependence of the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites To further examine Ca 2 + dependence of the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites , CHO cells were treated without ( control ) or with 10 l M ionomycin in the presence of various concentrations of extracellular Ca 2 + in order to change intracellular concentrations of Ca 2 + ( Fig . 7a ) , since intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations are thought to become equivalent to extracellular Ca 2 + concentrations via the action of ionomycin ( Sato et al . 1988 ) . It was estimated that B max values for the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyra - mine were maximally reduced to 7 . 6 (cid:1) 13 . 7 % by Ca 2 + and that EC 50 values for Ca 2 + to induce a half - maximal percentage reduction in B max values were 0 . 20 (cid:1) 0 . 12 mM . Signi ﬁ cant reduction in the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine was induced by relatively high concentrations of Ca 2 + ( 0 . 1 mM or more ) , which were thought to be 100 times higher than intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations increased by 0 . 1 mM histamine ( Hishinuma and Ogura 2000 ) . These results suggest that the ionomycin - induced loss of [ 3 H ] mepyramine - binding sites might be caused by markedly high concentrations of intracellular Ca 2 + . The ionomycin - induced reduction in B max values for the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine did not signi ﬁ cantly recover up to 4 h after removal of extracellular Ca 2 + with 10 mM EGTA in CHO cells and the percentage of cell viability estimated by trypan blue staining was 96 . 0 (cid:1) 1 . 9 % for control cells and 2 . 1 (cid:1) 1 . 0 % for cells treated with 10 l M ionomycin for 30 min in normal HEPES buffer ( n = 3 ) . These results suggest that the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors might be an irreversible process accompanied by a loss of cell viability as a possible pathophysiological mechanism responsible for cytotoxic Ca 2 + . To evaluate whether intracellular Ca 2 + might directly reduce the [ 3 H ] mepyramine binding to H 1 receptors , mem - branes were prepared from ionomycin - non - treated CHO cells and the mepyramine - sensitive [ 3 H ] mepyramine binding was measured in 25 mM HEPES buffer simply containing either 0 . 2 mM EGTA ( control ) or 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 ( Fig . 7b ) : B max values for the mepyramine - sensitive [ 3 H ] mepyramine binding to membrane preparations were not signi ﬁ cantly reduced by the presence of Ca 2 + ( 99 . 5 (cid:1) 1 . 2 % of control , n = 4 ) . These results indicate that ionomycin - induced Ca 2 + - dependent down - regulation of H 1 receptors might not be caused by the direct effects of intracellular Ca 2 + on H 1 receptors . Confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy to detect the ionomycin - induced loss of cellular histamine H 1 receptors In order to clarify whether H 1 receptor molecules are lost after the ionomycin treatment , we used CHO cells expressing human histamine H 1 receptors tagged with HA at the N terminus ( Hishinuma et al . 2016 ) , in which H 1 receptors were detected by an anti - HA antibody instead of [ 3 H ] mepyramine ( Fig . 8 ) . Confocal immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy showed that the anti - HA antibody , which was predominantly detected on the cell surface in ionomycin - non - treated control cells in normal HEPES buffer ( a ; control ) , was still detected in ionomycin - treated cells ( b ) in a similar manner to control cells . In contrast , the anti - HA antibody was predominantly detected in intracellular compartments in histamine - treated cells ( c ) , which indicated histamine - induced internalization of H 1 receptors . Thus , cellular H 1 receptors appeared to normally exist in ionomycin - treated cells in a form detectable with the anti - HA antibody , but not with [ 3 H ] mepyramine , with no subcellular changes in receptor distribution . Changes in histamine - induced accumulation of [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates after ionomycin treatment Since cellular H 1 receptors appeared to exist in a form detectable with the anti - HA antibody even in ionomycin - treated cells , it was of interest to further examine whether H 1 receptors might normally respond to histamine after iono - mycin treatment in CHO cells . Since H 1 receptors are coupled with a G q / 11 - protein / phospholipase C pathway to activate phosphatidylinositol turnover upon stimulation with histamine ( Hishinuma et al . 2016 ) , we examined histamine - induced accumulation of [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates in cells treated without ( control ) or with ionomycin . As shown in Fig . 9 , accumulation of [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates was induced by histamine in control cells ( open circle ) : The estimated maximal response was 264 (cid:1) 13 % of basal and the estimated EC 50 value for histamine was 4 . 7 (cid:1) 2 . 0 l M . In contrast , histamine - induced accumulation of [ 3 H ] inositol phosphates was lost in ionomycin - treated cells ( closed circle ) . Thus , histamine failed to stimulate H 1 receptors after ionomycin treatment possibly due to a loss of the binding sites of histamine in a similar manner to [ 3 H ] mepyramine .

Neurochem . ( 2018 ) 144 , 68 - - 80 Down - regulation of histamine H 1 receptor 77 with the loss of the pirdonium - sensitive binding sites of [ 3 H ] mepyramine , cell - surface H 1 receptors appeared to be lost by ionomycin . Since the agonist - induced internalization of H 1 receptors is generally considered to be a pre - requisite process for their subsequent down - regulation in lysosomes and / or proteasomes , we examined the involvement of receptor endocytosis in the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors . We found that the loss of cell - surface H 1 receptors was not caused by receptor endocytosis via clathrin and caveolae / lipid rafts . Thus , the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors appeared to occur without the process of receptor endocytosis . Accordingly , lysosomes and proteasomes did not appear to be involved in the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors . A down - regulation pathway that does not require endocytosis is known to exist in the agonist - induced down - regulation of muscarinic M 2 receptors in CHO cells ( Tsuga et al . 1998 ) and ß 2 - adrenoceptors in murine ﬁ broblast L cells and A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells ( Jockers et al . 1999 ) . However , these processes are in contrast to those for the agonist - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors in CHO cells , which is considered to occur via proteasome / lysosome - mediated degradation after clathrin - dependent receptor endocytosis ( Hishinuma et al . 2010 ) . Confocal immuno ﬂ u - orescence microscopy indicated that cellular H 1 receptors existed even after the ionomycin treatment in a form detectable by the antibody against HA - tagged H 1 receptors , but not by [ 3 H ] mepyramine , with no subcellular changes in receptor distribution . This was also in contrast to our previous ﬁ ndings showing that cell - surface H 1 receptors were delivered to the Golgi apparatus upon a stimulation with an agonist ( Hishinuma et al . 2016 ) .

Ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors involves Ca 2 + - dependent , but calmodulin / protein kinase C / calpain - independent mechanisms The ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors was revealed to be regulated by Ca 2 + - dependent , but calmodulin / protein kinase C - independent mechanisms , whereas the agonist - induced internalization and down - regulation of H 1 receptors were found to be regulated by Ca 2 + / calmodulin and protein kinase C ( Hishinuma et al . 1998 , 2010 ) . The ionomycin - induced down - regulation of H 1 receptors might not be caused by the direct action of intracellular Ca 2 + to H 1 receptors , since the mepyramine - sensitive binding of [ 3 H ] mepyramine was well retained in membrane preparations in the presence of Ca 2 + . Calpain , which is known to be involved in the ionomycin - induced down - regulation of androgen receptors ( Libertini et al . 2007 ) , the inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trispho - sphate receptor ( Kopil et al . 2011 ) , the K - Cl co - transporter KCC2 ( Puskarjov et al . 2012 ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( Liao and Carpenter 2012 ) , did not appear to be involved in this Ca 2 + - dependent down - regulation of H 1 receptors . One possible mechanism involved may be conformational changes in receptor molecules via ubiquiti - nation , by which [ 3 H ] mepyramine , but not the anti - HA antibody , failed to bind to the receptors ; however , the mechanisms by which ubiquitination processes are regulated by Ca 2 + remained to be elucidated . Nevertheless , this Ca 2 + - dependent and endocytosis - independent down - regulation of H 1 receptors may function as an alternative or additional regulatory mechanism for cellular homeostasis in response to a sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations . Conclusions This study provided the evidence that the binding capacity of ligands for GPCRs could be lost by a sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations with no apparent endocy - tosis and lysosomal / proteasomal degradation of receptors . These results provide a novel insight into how ligand sensitivity of receptors is regulated by intracellular Ca 2 + . Acknowledgments and conﬂict of interest disclosure We thank Mr .
