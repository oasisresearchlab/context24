Here we show that actobindin has the same biochemical properties as the Drosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans homologous protein that consists of three (cid:1) - thymosin repeats . These proteins define a new family of actin - binding proteins . They bind G - actin in a 1 : 1 complex with thermodynamic and kinetic parameters similar to (cid:1) - thymosins . Like (cid:1) - thymosins , they slow down nucleotide exchange on G - actin and make a ternary complex with G - actin and Latrunculin A . On the other hand , they behave as func - tional homologs of profilin because their complex with MgATP - G - actin , unlike (cid:1) - thymosin - actin , participates in filament barbed end growth , like profilin - actin complex . Therefore these proteins play an active role in actin - based motility processes . In addition , proteins of the actobindin family interact with the pointed end of actin filaments and inhibit pointed end growth , maybe via the interaction of the (cid:1) - thymosin repeats with two terminal subunits . Proteins of the (cid:1) - thymosin family are small ( 5 kDa ) peptides that act as G - actin sequestering factors , because they bind ATP - G - actin in a 1 : 1 complex that is unable to polymerize into filaments ( 1 – 5 ) . In vivo , these proteins build a reservoir of unassembled ( monomeric ) actin ( 6 – 8 ) . The interaction of thy - mosin (cid:1) 4 , the major variant , and thymosin (cid:1) 10 , a minor vari - ant , with actin has been thoroughly analyzed ( 3 , 9 – 14 ) . Be - cause (cid:1) - thymosins are simple passive sequesterers in rapid equilibrium with ATP - G - actin , the balance between polymer - ized ( F - actin ) and nonassembled actin in living cells is in fact controlled by regulatory proteins that affect the steady - state concentration of free ATP - G - actin by modulating the dynamic parameters of filament assembly - disassembly at the barbed and pointed ends . The amount of sequestered actin is increased by proteins that cause an increase in steady - state ATP - G - actin and vice versa . For instance , profilin makes a complex with G - actin that energetically contributes to monomer - polymer ex - changes at the barbed ends as well as ATP - G - actin itself . As a result , profilin causes a decrease in the partial critical concen - tration of ATP - G - actin . Therefore , upon addition of profilin to a solution of F - actin in the presence of T (cid:1) 4 , the amount of T (cid:1) 4 - actin complex decreases , i . e . F - actin increases ( 15 ) . Conversely , addition of actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , which increases the concentration of ATP - G - actin at steady state , leads to in - creased sequestration of G - actin by T (cid:1) 4 , i . e . causes F - actin disassembly ( 16 ) . The structure of the T (cid:1) 4 - actin complex is not known at atomic resolution ; however , NMR and biochemical studies con - sistently show that T (cid:1) 4 binds actin in an extended configura - tion , the N - terminal segment interacting with the barbed end of the actin monomer , while the C - terminal region binds sub - domain 2 at the pointed end of the actin monomer ( 13 , 14 ) . This view satisfactorily accounts for the fact that T (cid:1) 4 inhibits G - actin association with both the barbed and the pointed ends of actin filaments . (cid:1) - Thymosins have been found in all vertebrates and in echi - noderms and mollusks ( 17 , 18 ) . Recently , a cDNA clone encod - ing for a 41 - amino acid (cid:1) - thymosin has been identified in the calcareus sponge Scyon raphanus ( 19 ) , indicating the ancient character of (cid:1) - thymosin among metazoa . On the other hand , (cid:1) - thymosins are absent in yeast , amoeba , Drosophila , and plants . In Acanthamoeba castellanii , a protein called acto - bindin consists of two (cid:1) - thymosin repeats and has been iden - tified as a G - actin - binding protein that may also sequester actin dimers ( 20 – 24 ) . A BLAST search on the complete genomic sequences of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorh - abditis elegans identified a triplicate (cid:1) - thymosin sequence ( 19 ) . Independently , this 3 - (cid:1) - thymosin repeat protein , called cibou - lot ( Cib ) , has been identified in Drosophila as being involved in the control of brain development during metamorphosis and characterized as a G - actin - binding protein ( 25 ) . Amazingly , although ciboulot shares sequence homology with T (cid:1) 4 , the Cib - actin complex participates in filament barbed end assem - bly like profilin - actin ( 25 ) . The profilin - like property of Cib accounts for its function in actin - based motility and axonal growth . These observations raise an issue of structural and functional relevance about the evolution of the actin binding domain of (cid:1) - thymosins . Are some biochemical properties of (cid:1) - thymosins found unaltered in actobindin and Cib ? What are the structural features at the origin of the functional difference between T (cid:1) 4 and Cib ? Is actobindin , the amoeba (cid:1) - thymosin two - repeat protein , functionally similar to T (cid:1) 4 or to Cib ? Here we compare Cib and actobindin regarding their binding to G - actin , their effects on nucleotide exchange on G - actin , and their effects on actin assembly at the two ends of filaments , with either MgATP - actin or CaATP - actin . We show that acto - bindin is functionally similar to Cib or profilin , and differs from (cid:1) - thymosins , regarding the control of filament dynamics . On the other hand , actobindin and Cib both slow down nucleotide * This work was supported in part by the Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer ( to M . - F . C . ) .

We conclude that proteins that consist of (cid:1) - thymosin repeats like actobindin in Acanthamoeba or ciboulot in Drosophila and probably the C . elegans homolog must play a positive role in motile properties of living organ - isms . The pure G - actin sequestering function of regular (cid:1) - thy - mosins may result from divergent evolution . MATERIALS AND METHODS Proteins— Actin was purified from rabbit muscle , isolated as CaATP - G - actin by Sephadex G 200 chromatography in G buffer ( 5 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 m M ATP , 1 m M dithiothreitol , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) . Actin was pyrenyl labeled on cysteine 374 ( 26 ) and NBD 1 - labeled on lysine 373 ( 27 ) . Gelsolin was a kind gift from Dr . Yukio Doi ( University of Kyoto , Kyoto , Japan ) and actobindin was purified from Acanthamoeba castel - lanii ( 20 ) . Thymosin (cid:1) 4 and profilin were prepared as described previ - ously ( 15 ) . The fusion protein GST - Cib cloned in the expression vector p - GEX2T * ( Amersham Bioscience ) was induced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified ( 15 ) . The Cib protein was then cleaved off the GST moiety with thrombin , dialyzed against 20 m M Tris - Cl , 1 m M dithiothreitol , pH 7 . 5 , and stored at (cid:1) 80 °C . The concentration of Cib was derived from amino acid analysis , from which a standardized bicinchoninic acid assay was developed . Actin Polymerization Measurements— Steady - state measurements of F - actin were derived from fluorescence measurements of pyrenyl - la - beled actin . Actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labeled ) was polymerized under phys - iological ionic conditions ( 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 ) in the absence or presence of gelsolin ( at 1 : 300 molar ratio to actin ) and in the presence or absence of Cib or actobindin at the indicated concentrations . The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant K C for the Cib - actin ( or actobindin - actin ) complex [ CA ] was derived from measurements of the amount of assembled actin at steady state ( after 18 - h incubation ) ( see the following equations ) , (cid:2) A U (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) A (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) CA (cid:3) (cid:2) A (cid:3) (cid:2) C C (cid:2) C 0 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) CA (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) C (cid:3) K C (cid:2) (cid:2) C (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) A (cid:3) / (cid:2) CA (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:4)(cid:2) C 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) A U (cid:3) (cid:3) C C (cid:5) (cid:2) C C / (cid:4)(cid:2) A U (cid:3) (cid:4) C C ) ( Eq . 1 ) where [ A U ] and [ A ] are the concentrations of unassembled actin and free G - actin at steady state and [ C 0 ] is the total concentration of acto - bindin or Cib . Initial rates of filament growth from the barbed and the pointed ends were measured spectrofluorometrically using either spectrin - actin seeds ( 28 ) or gelsolin - actin seeds , respectively . Gelsolin - actin seeds were prepared by mixing gelsolin and a 2 . 5 molar equivalent CaATP - G - actin in G buffer . The adequate amount of seeds was added at time 0 together with salt to a solution of MgATP - or CaATP - G - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labeled ) and Cib or actobindin . The initial rate of pyrene fluo - rescence increase was converted into molar amount of assembled F - actin using a critical concentration plot derived from the same actin solution . Data were analyzed and simulated as described in Yarmola et al . ( 29 ) Depolymerization rates at the pointed ends were measured by 20 - fold dilution of a solution of 2 . 5 (cid:5) M gelsolin - capped filaments ( 50 % pyrenyl - labeled ) in F buffer containing known amounts of Cib or actobindin . Nucleotide Exchange on G - actin— Kinetics of nucleotide exchange on monomeric actin were monitored using the change in fluorescence of (cid:6) ATP upon binding to G - actin ( 30 ) . ATP - G - actin 1 : 1 complex was ob - tained by Dowex - 1 treatment and diluted to 1 (cid:5) M in 5 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 , 1 m M dithiothreitol , in the presence of Cib or actobindin . The increase in fluorescence ( (cid:7) exc (cid:6) 350 nm , (cid:7) em (cid:6) 410 nm ) upon addition of 5 (cid:5) M (cid:6) ATP was monitored using a Safas flx spectroflu - orometer . The fluorescence time courses were satisfactorily analyzed in terms of a monoexponential process . The observed first order rate constant displayed hyperbolic saturation behavior with the concentra - tion of Cib or actobindin , consistent with a model in which Cib or actobindin shuttle from one molecule of G - actin to the other at a faster rate than nucleotide dissociates from G - actin or from Cib - actin or acto - bindin - actin complexes . The equilibrium dissociation constant for the Cib - actin or actobindin - actin complex was derived from the dependence of the apparent exchange rate constant on the concentration of Cib or actobindin , as follows , (cid:2) A (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) CA (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) A 0 (cid:3) (cid:2) C (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) CA (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) C 0 (cid:3) k obs (cid:2) (cid:4) k 1 (cid:2) A (cid:3) (cid:3) k 2 (cid:2) CA (cid:3)(cid:5) / (cid:2) A 0 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:4)(cid:2) A (cid:3) / (cid:2) A 0 (cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:7) k 1 (cid:3) k 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) C 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) A 0 (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) A (cid:3)(cid:5) / K C } ( Eq . 2 ) with (cid:2) A (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:4) 1 / 2 (cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:2) A 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) C 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) K C (cid:8) (cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:2) A 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:2) C 0 (cid:3) (cid:4) K C (cid:5) 2 (cid:3) 4 K C (cid:2) A 0 (cid:3)(cid:5) 1 / 2 (cid:8) ( Eq . 3 ) (cid:2) CA (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:4) 1 / 2 (cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:2) A 0 (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) C 0 (cid:3) (cid:3) K C (cid:8) (cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:2) A 0 (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2) C 0 (cid:3) (cid:3) K C (cid:5) 2 (cid:4) 4 (cid:2) A 0 (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:2) C 0 (cid:3)(cid:5) 1 / 2 (cid:8) ( Eq . 4 ) where [ A ] , [ A 0 ] , [ C ] , [ C 0 ] are the free and total concentrations of G - actin and Cib or actobindin and [ CA ] is the concentration of the complex ; k 1 and k 2 are the rate constants for nucleotide dissociation from G - actin and from the CA complex , respectively ; K C is the equilibrium dissocia - tion constant of the CA complex . The values of k 1 and k 2 were deter - mined experimentally in the absence and in the presence of saturating amounts of Cib . The value of K C was derived from the adjustment of the calculated curves k obs ( [ C 0 ] ) to the data . Equilibrium and Kinetic Measurements of the Interaction of Cib with G - actin— The change in fluorescence of NBD - labeled G - actin was used as a probe for the formation of the complexes of G - actin with T (cid:1) 4 , actobindin , or Cib . Static fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Spex Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorimeter in G buffer for CaATP - G - actin and in G buffer supplemented with 10 (cid:5) M MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 m M EGTA for MgATP - G - actin . Samples contained 1 . 5 (cid:5) M NBD - G - actin and different amounts of Cib . Excitation and emission wavelengths were 475 nm and 525 nm , respectively . The equilibrium dissociation constant for the complex was derived from the dependence of the fluorescence change on the total concentration of T (cid:1) 4 , actobindin , or Cib , analyzed using Equa - tion 4 . The kinetics of interaction of NBD - G - actin with Cib were monitored by fluorescence ( (cid:7) exc (cid:6) 470 nm , slit 0 . 25 mm ) using a stopped - flow apparatus ( DX - 18 MV , Applied Photophysics ) , with a 270 - (cid:5) s noise filter . A solution of K 2 Cr 2 O 7 was placed on the emission beam to eliminate light scattered at the excitation wavelength . Four to six superimposable time courses were averaged for each concentration of Cib . RESULTS Direct Binding and Kinetics of Interaction of Cib and Acto - bindin with G - actin— To evaluate the thermodynamic and rate parameters of the interaction of Cib and of actobindin with G - actin , we sought suitable spectroscopic probes . While binding of T (cid:1) 4 to G - actin is accompanied by a 20 % increase ( 11 ) , and binding of profilin by a 25 % decrease ( 30 ) in tryptophane fluo - rescence of actin , no change was observed with Cib . T (cid:1) 4 also causes a large change in the fluorescence of AEDANS - labeled actin ( 14 ) . Binding of Cib to AEDANS - G - actin caused a 7 - nm blue shift in the excitation and emission spectra and a 5 % increase in fluorescence ( (cid:7) exc (cid:6) 340 nm , (cid:7) em (cid:6) 480 nm ) , sug - gesting a less polar environment of the AEDANS fluorophore in the Cib - actin complex than in G - actin ( an effect conspicuously opposite to the one observed ( 14 ) with T (cid:1) 4 ) , but the signal was too small to be useful in kinetic experiments . Like T (cid:1) 4 , neither actobindin nor Cib affected the fluorescence of pyrenyl - labeled G - actin , in agreement with previous reports ( 22 , 25 ) . On the other hand , the fluorescence of actin in which lysine 373 was NBD - labeled was increased by 25 % upon binding of Cib , acto - bindin , or T (cid:1) 4 ( Fig . 1 ) . A similar change has been reported when actobindin bound to actin in which cysteine 374 was labeled by IANBD ( 22 ) . The equilibrium dissociation constants K C of the 1 : 1 complexes of G - actin with T (cid:1) 4 , Cib , and acto - bindin were derived from the analysis of the dependence of the fluorescence change on protein concentration according to Equation 4 ( Fig . 1 ) . Similar values of K C were obtained for all 1 The abbreviations used are : NBD , 12 - ( N - methyl - N - ( 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazol - 4 - yl ) ) ; AEDANS , 1 , 5 - I - AEDANS , 5 - [ 2 - ( iodoacetamido ) - ethylamino ] naphthalene - 1 - sulfonic acid ; IANBD , N - ( ( 2 - iodoacetoxy ) - ethyl ) N - methyl ) amino - 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazole .

Latrunculin A is a drug that interacts with G - actin with high affinity ( 5 (cid:5) M (cid:1) 1 ) and prevents polymerization ( 31 ) . Latrunculin A has been shown to noncompetitively inhibit T (cid:1) 4 binding to G - actin , decreasing the affinity of actin for T (cid:1) 4 by approxi - mately an order of magnitude in the ternary complex ( 32 ) . The present data show that in the presence of saturating ( 20 (cid:5) M ) concentrations of latrunculin A , the change in fluorescence of NBD - actin ( 1 . 5 (cid:5) M ) upon binding Cib or actobindin or T (cid:1) 4 was lower . The value of K C for binding T (cid:1) 4 or Cib or actobindin to NBD - G - actin was increased about 2 - fold by latrunculin A ( Ta - ble I ) . The data are consistent with the formation of a ternary complex between G - actin , latrunculin A , and either Cib or actobindin or T (cid:1) 4 . No binding of Cib or actobindin to ADP - actin was detected using the change in NBD - fluorescence ( data not shown ) . It is known that the fluorescence of NBD - actin , in contrast to pyre - nyl - actin , is not affected by the bound nucleotide ( 33 ) . In con - clusion , like T (cid:1) 4 and profilin , Cib has a high specificity for binding ATP - G - actin . The change in NBD fluorescence was used to monitor the kinetics of Cib - actin complex formation . Cib bound to NBD - G - actin within a single exponential process . The apparent first order rate constant k obs increased practically linearly with Cib concentration in the range 0 – 40 (cid:5) M Cib ( Fig . 2 ) . The apparent association rate constant ( k (cid:9) (cid:6) 1 . 6 (cid:5) M (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) s (cid:1) 1 ) was derived from the slope , and the apparent dissociation rate constant ( k (cid:1) (cid:6) 14 s (cid:1) 1 ) was derived from the lower limit of k obs at low Cib concen - tration . The value of the ratio k (cid:1) / k (cid:9) ( 3 (cid:5) M ) was in good agree - ment with the equilibrium dissociation constant derived from the dependence of the fluorescence change on Cib concentra - tion . The value of 14 s (cid:1) 1 for k (cid:1) was then confirmed by a competition experiment in which Cib was displaced from the Cib - NBD - actin complex by a 10 - fold excess of unlabeled actin . To verify that the affinity of Cib or actobindin is not affected by NBD labeling , the following experiment was carried out . Increasing amounts of actobindin or Cib were added to two parallel samples of actin , containing either 10 or 50 % NBD - actin , polymerized at 1 . 6 (cid:5) M in the presence of 4 n M gelsolin . The linear decrease in the amount of F - actin was consistent with the same affinity of Cib or actobindin for G - actin inde - pendently of the proportion of labeled actin ( supplementary data , Fig . 1 ) . Actobindin and Cib Slow Down Nucleotide Exchange on G - actin— Thymosin (cid:1) 4 is known to slow down nucleotide dissoci - ation from G - actin , while profilin accelerates it . It has often been proposed that the effect of profilin on nucleotide exchange supports its effect on motility in vivo . Both actobindin and Cib , which enhance actin - based motility like profilin in an in vitro reconstituted motility assay ( 25 ) , slow down nucleotide disso - ciation from G - actin , like T (cid:1) 4 ( Fig . 3 ) . The exchange rate was decreased 12 - and 9 - fold by actobindin and by Cib , respectively , while it was decreased 20 - fold by T (cid:1) 4 under the same condi - tions . Analysis of the data using Equation 2 yielded values of 2 . 0 (cid:5) M and 1 . 7 (cid:5) M for the equilibrium disssociation constants for binding of actobindin and Cib , respectively , to CaATP - G - actin in G buffer . This result indicates that Cib and actobindin share some of the binding features of T (cid:1) 4 . Their association with G - actin is linked to the slower dissociation of ATP . However , the effects of these two proteins on the dynamics of actin filaments are independent of their effects on nucleotide exchange on G - actin . The Actobindin - Actin Complex Participates in Barbed End Assembly of MgATP - actin , Like Cib - Actin and Profilin - Actin— The effect of actobindin on the steady - state amount of 10 % pyrenyl - labeled F - actin was measured under physiological con - ditions ( 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 ) in the absence and in the presence of gelsolin ( Fig . 4 ) .

The amount of depolymerized actin increased linearly with the concentration of actobindin , consistent with sequestration of MgATP - G - actin by actobindin in a 1 : 1 complex , with an equi - librium dissociation constant K C of 6 (cid:5) M . This value is in good agreement with previous measurements ( 22 – 24 ) , as well as with the value derived from nucleotide exchange kinetics ( Fig . 3 ) . A similar value ( K C (cid:6) 2 . 5 (cid:5) M ) had been found for the Cib - actin complex using the same assay ( 25 ) . In contrast , ac - tobindin did not depolymerize F - actin when barbed ends were free . The very slow decrease in F - actin versus actobindin con - centration is consistent with the lowering of the steady - state concentration of G - actin upon addition of actobindin . As an example , at 20 (cid:5) M actobindin , the measured concentration of unassembled actin was 0 . 15 (cid:5) M ( Fig . 4 ) . Using Equation 1 with [ C 0 ] (cid:6) 20 (cid:5) M , [ A U ] (cid:6) 0 . 15 (cid:5) M , and K C (cid:6) 5 (cid:5) M , the value of C C ( free G - actin ) is 0 . 03 (cid:5) M , much lower than the value of 0 . 1 (cid:5) M measured in the absence of actobindin . This result implies that actin - actobindin complex , like profilin - actin complex , partici - pates in barbed end assembly as well as actin itself , hence it lowers the energetic contribution of G - actin to monomer - poly - mer exchanges at steady state . In conclusion , actobindin - actin complex , like Cib - actin and profilin - actin , can stabilize the barbed ends , via monomer - polymer exchange reactions , as ef - ficiently as G - actin . The validity of the above conclusions relies on the assump - tion that the affinity of actobindin for actin is not affected by pyrenyl labeling . This was first established by Lambooy and Korn ( 20 ) . We have confirmed this conclusion both for Cib and actobindin by checking that the value of K C derived from as - says shown in Fig . 4 was independent of the proportion of pyrenyl - actin .

The curves are calculated using Equation 2 and values of 2 and 1 . 7 (cid:5) M for the equilib - rium dissociation constants for the actobindin - actin complex and Cib - actin complex , respectively .

When all MgATP - G - actin was in complex with actobindin , the rate of barbed end growth was 70 % of the rate observed with G - actin alone , indicating that the acto - bindin - actin complex associates with barbed ends with a rate constant only 30 % lower than G - actin . This value is identical to the one found first for profilin - actin ( 30 ) and Cib - actin ( 25 ) association with barbed ends . Association of Actobindin or Cib with Filament Pointed Ends Blocks Pointed End Growth but Not Depolymerization— The steady - state measurements displayed in Fig . 1 show that acto - bindin and Cib form a 1 : 1 complex with MgATP - G - actin that does not participate in pointed end filament assembly . Forma - tion of this complex is expected to cause inhibition of filament pointed end elongation from G - actin subunits . Seeded growth assays using gelsolin - actin seeds were carried out at two dif - ferent concentrations of G - actin . The decrease in the initial rate of elongation off gelsolin - actin seeds upon addition of ac - tobindin should reflect saturation of G - actin by actobindin . Hence more actobindin should be needed to saturate a higher amount of G - actin . Typically , since the pointed end critical concentration is 0 . 5 (cid:5) M , the rate of growth is expected to reach zero when 1 . 5 (cid:5) M complex is formed at 2 (cid:5) M actin and when 4 . 5 (cid:5) M complex is formed at 5 (cid:5) M actin . 50 % inhibition of elonga - tion should therefore be reached at an actobindin concentration A 50 % (cid:6) 3 . 75 (cid:5) M at 2 (cid:5) M actin and A 50 % (cid:6) 6 . 34 (cid:5) M at 5 (cid:5) M actin ( using the law of mass action with actin - actobindin complex (cid:6) 1 / 2 ( total actin (cid:1) 0 . 5 (cid:5) M ) and K C (cid:6) 5 (cid:5) M ) . In the case of Cib , 50 % inhibition of filament growth should be achieved by addition of 2 . 25 (cid:5) M Cib at 2 (cid:5) M actin and 4 . 3 (cid:5) M Cib at 5 (cid:5) M actin . The experimental data differed from the expected behavior . Elon - gation of filaments off gelsolin - actin seeds was inhibited by actobindin and Cib , but the rate of growth at pointed ends displayed superimposable concentration dependencies ( within experimental error ) at 2 (cid:5) M and at 5 (cid:5) M G - actin and could not be accounted for by the calculated curves within a sequestra - tion model ( Fig . 5 ) . Half - inhibition was observed at a lower concentration of actobindin or Cib than expected within the sequestration activity . The superimposable curves at two dif - ferent actin concentrations suggest that actobindin or Cib bind to pointed ends with high affinity , preventing their growth . Analysis within pointed end capping with a K P value of 0 . 6 (cid:5) M and a sequestration constant K C of 5 (cid:5) M for actobindin and 2 . 5 (cid:5) M for Cib satisfactorily accounted for the data ( Fig . 5 ) . The fact that a higher affinity is observed for binding to the pointed end than for binding to monomeric actin suggests , in agreement with previous results ( 23 ) , that actobindin and Cib may interact with two actins at the pointed end , via their T (cid:1) 4 repeats . Similar data were obtained using CaATP - actin instead of MgATP - actin and a polymerization buffer that contained 0 . 1 M KCl . To determine whether actobindin and Cib prevent pointed end disassembly , dilution - induced depolymerization of gelso - lin - capped filaments was performed . The initial rate of depo - lymerization from the pointed ends was not affected by either actobindin or Cib up to 10 (cid:5) M ( see supplemetary data Fig . 2 ) . In conclusion , association of actobindin or Cib with pointed ends prevents growth but not depolymerization . The behavior of Cib and actobindin has some similarity here with DNase I , which also prevents pointed end growth but does not prevent depolymerization ( 34 ) . The failure of Cib and actobindin to prevent pointed end depolymerization may be in relation with the poor binding of these proteins to ADP - actin , which is exposed at depolymerizing pointed ends , while ATP - actin is at the end of growing filaments . Therefore at the steady state of assembly of gelsolin - capped filaments , the relevant reac - tion is essentially the sequestration of monomeric actin by actobindin or Cib . Actobindin and Cib Act as Purely G - actin Sequestering Pro - teins When CaATP Is Bound to Actin— Polymerization of CaATP - actin is quasi - reversible due to the slow hydrolysis of ATP on CaATP - F - actin . Consistently , the critical concentra - tions are practically identical ( 0 . 6 (cid:5) M ) at the two ends . Profilin - CaATP - actin failed to polymerize at the barbed ends ( 35 ) . Both actobindin and Cib displayed the same behavior as profilin regarding interaction with CaATP - actin and caused depoly - merization of F - actin ( i . e . sequestration of G - actin ) at the barbed and at the pointed end ( Fig . 6 ) . Values of 8 (cid:11) 1 (cid:5) M were derived from the data for the equilibrium dissociation con - stants of the complexes of CaATP - G - actin with either acto - F IG . 4 . Actobindin sequesters MgATP - G - actin only when barbed ends are capped . Actobindin was added at the indicated concentrations to F - actin ( 1 . 6 (cid:5) M , 10 % pyrenyl - labeled ) , assembled in the absence ( open circles ) and in the presence ( closed circles ) of gelsolin at 1 : 300 molar ratio to actin . The data obtained in the presence of gelsolin are consistent with the formation of a nonpolymerizable actin - actobindin 1 : 1 complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant K C of 5 (cid:5) M . The dashed line is calculated assuming sequestration at the barbed ends with K C (cid:6) 5 (cid:5) M and a steady - state concentration of ATP - G - actin of 0 . 1 (cid:5) M . Inset , the actin - actobindin complex productively associates with barbed ends . The rate of barbed end growth was meas - ured using spectrin - actin seeds ( see “Materials and Methods” ) and 2 . 5 (cid:5) M pyrenyl - actin . Values of the rate were identical at 2 . 5 , 10 , and 15 (cid:5) M actobindin . F IG . 5 . Actobindin and Cib inhibit pointed end elongation by binding to the pointed ends . The rate of elongation from the pointed ends was measured using gelsolin - actin seeds ( 5 n M ) and either 5 (cid:5) M ( open symbols ) or 2 (cid:5) M ( closed symbols ) G - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labeled ) , in the presence of actobindin ( triangles ) or Cib ( circles ) at the indicated concentrations . Rates are normalized taking the 100 % reference for the rate of elongation measured in the absence of actobindin or Cib . The curves are calculated for actobindin , at 5 (cid:5) M actin ( dashed lines ) and 2 (cid:5) M actin ( continuous lines ) , using a simple sequestration model ( thin lines , K C (cid:6) 5 (cid:5) M ) and a combined capping and sequestration model ( thick lines , K C (cid:6) 5 (cid:5) M , K P (cid:6) 0 . 7 (cid:5) M ) .

In conclusion , the general features of the differ - ent interactions of profilin with CaATP - actin and MgATP - actin are displayed by actobindin and Cib . DISCUSSION We have shown that regarding its biochemical properties and biological function , the amoeba protein actobindin is a member of a new family of actin - binding proteins . These pro - teins consist of two or three (cid:1) - thymosin repeats and share some biochemical properties with (cid:1) - thymosins . For instance they bind ATP - G - actin specifically with thermodynamic and rate parameters very similar to T (cid:1) 4 and slow down nucleotide dis - sociation from G - actin - like (cid:1) - thymosins , indicating that their binding sites appreciably overlap the T (cid:1) 4 binding site on G - actin . This conclusion is in agreement with results from EDC - cross - linking experiments , which indicated that lysine 18 of T (cid:1) 4 ( 13 ) and lysine 16 of actobindin ( 36 ) make contacts with the 4 N - terminal acidic residues of actin . The rate constant for association to G - actin is lower than the expected diffusion - limited rate constant , suggesting , as proposed for T (cid:1) 4 ( 14 ) , that the formation of a low affinity rapid equilibrium collision com - plex is followed by a reversible isomerization step leading to a tighter interaction ; alternatively , the protein might be in rapid equilibrium between several conformational states , one of which only binds G - actin . On the other hand , unlike (cid:1) - thymosins , these proteins are not pure G - actin sequesterers but actually regulate the dynam - ics of filament assembly using the same mechanism as profilin , i . e . their complex with MgATP - G - actin participates in barbed end growth exclusively . This property is observed in kinetic assays of seeded filament growth . Its consequence at steady state is the lowering of the steady - state concentration of free G - actin , consistent with copolymerization of actin and acto - bindin - actin or Cib - actin complexes . The failure of actobindin to depolymerize actin at steady state when barbed ends are free or inhibit barbed end growth had been noticed previously but had been explained differently ( 24 ) . Due to the ability of their complex with actin to participate in barbed end growth , pro - teins of the actobindin family play an active role , like profilin , in actin - based motility processes . We have shown that the Drosophila homolog , ciboulot , is required for axonal growth during central brain development in metamorphosis of the fly and that either Cib or actobindin can replace profilin in a reconstituted motility assay ( 25 ) . The present work indicates that actobindin likewise must be required for some motile processes of the amoeba . Like for profilin , the participation of actobindin - actin or Cib - actin to barbed end growth is observed with MgATP - actin only , and a pure G - actin sequestering func - tion is observed with CaATP - actin . These results point to a possible role of ATP hydrolysis associated with actin polymer - ization in this function . Actobindin consists of two imperfect (cid:1) - thymosin repeats , while the Drosophila and C . elegans pro - teins harbor three (cid:1) - thymosin repeats , suggesting that their functional difference with T (cid:1) 4 might correlate with the fact that the (cid:1) - thymosin motif is repeated . This view is not sup - ported , however , by the following observations . Similar G - actin binding motifs showing similarity with T (cid:1) 4 , called “verprolin homology region” or WH2 domain , are found in WASp family proteins , and in the ActA protein of Listeria , where they have been demonstrated to share the same functional homology with profilin ( Refs . 37 – 39 and see Ref . 40 for a recent review ) . In these proteins , the G - actin binding module is generally not repeated , except in the case of N - WASp ( the neural form of WASp ) , which contains a tandem of two verprolin homology regions . Hence it seems likely that a subtle difference in se - quence in the G - actin binding motif , rather than the repeat of the motif , is responsible for the functional difference between (cid:1) - thymosins and these proteins . The repeated sequences would then simply help to enhance the affinity of these proteins for G - actin . Further studies of the biochemical properties of the isolated repeats are required to challenge this view . A mutage - netic analysis of these proteins should also help to elucidate the structural basis for the change in function of the (cid:1) - thymosin motif . In this respect , previous studies have shown that chang - ing the sequence 17 LKKTET 22 in the actin binding motif of T (cid:1) 4 into LKETET caused T (cid:1) 4 - induced actin aggregation in low ionic strength buffer ( 9 ) . In addition to this segment , T (cid:1) 4 interacts with G - actin via helix 1 ( residues 5 – 16 ) and helix 2 ( residues 31 – 39 ) ( 42 ) . According to Safer and co - workers ( 13 , 14 ) , C - terminal helix 2 interacts with subdomain 2 at the pointed end of G - actin . This contact may prevent association of the T (cid:1) 4 - actin complex to the barbed end of an actin filament . In binding to G - actin , Cib and actobindin do not sterically inter - fere with subdomain 2 association to a barbed end . Finally , (cid:1) - thymosin repeat proteins display the original property , not shown by either profilin or (cid:1) - thymosins , to pre - vent pointed end growth by a capping effect . This result has no physiological significance since in vivo pointed ends only depo - lymerize , but it is interesting from a structural point of view . The affinity for pointed ends is about 5 - fold higher than for monomeric actin . This result is surprising and paradoxical . Actually , the view that actobindin - actin and Cib - actin partici - pate in barbed end growth intuitively suggests that these pro - teins are transiently bound to the terminal subunit at the barbed end of the filament , but cannot be bound to the pointed end . To accommodate the unexpected pointed end capping we propose that two (cid:1) - thymosin repeats of a single protein may interact with two terminal subunits at the pointed end . The structure of actobindin or Cib bound to the pointed end may be similar to the structure of the reported high affinity complex of actobindin with covalently cross - linked actin dimers obtained by reacting F - actin with para - phenylene - bis - maleimide ( 43 ) . The covalent bond connects lysine 191 to cysteine 374 of a laterally adjacent subunit along the genetic helix ( 41 ) , i . e . may reconstitute the pointed end structure of a filament . Resolution of the three - dimensional structure of the complex of actobindin or Cib with G - actin is required to challenge this hypothesis . REFERENCES 1 .
