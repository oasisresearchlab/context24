DOI : 10 . 1189 / jlb . 1A0416 - 195R ABSTRACT Neutrophil extravasation is a critical step of the innate immune system’s response to inflammation . This multi - step process is tightly regulated by adhesion and sig - naling molecules in the endothelium and neutrophils . Activation of the b 2 integrin LFA - 1 is critical for adhesion of leukocytes to postcapillary venules . This step requires coordinated activation of signaling pathways in chemokine - stimulated neutrophils , including GTPase activation and cytoskeletal remodeling , leading to con - formational changes in LFA - 1 . Hematopoietic cell - specific lyn substrate 1 ( HS1 ) is a cortactin - related and leukocyte - specific actin - binding protein ( ABP ) that reg - ulates several processes in various immune cells . It has been shown in vitro that HS1 is important for neutrophil chemotaxis and transendothelial migration of NK cells , but its role in neutrophil extravasation in vivo has not been investigated yet . Intravital microscopy of CXCL1 - stimulated cremaster venules revealed an increased rolling velocity and reduced neutrophil adhesion and transmigration in HS1 knockout ( KO ) mice . CXCL1 - induced rapid neutrophil arrest in vivo and adhesion under flow conditions in vitro were also reduced signif - icantly . Whereas random motility of neutrophils was unaffected , chemotaxis toward a CXCL1 gradient was reduced in the absence of HS1 . Further analysis of the underlying mechanisms demonstrated that HS1 controls CXCL1 - induced activation of the small GTPases Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) and Ras - related protein 1 ( Rap1 ) , thus supporting LFA - 1 - mediated neutrophil adhesion . Importantly , with the use of Rac1 KO neutrophils , we could show that Rac1 acts upstream of Rap1 . Our results establish HS1 as an important regulator of proper Rac1 and Rap1 activation and neutrophil extravasation . J . Leukoc . Biol . 101 : 1133 – 1142 ; 2017 . Introduction Neutrophils are an important class of leukocytes that contribute to pathogen clearance in in ﬂ amed tissues , both through the release of antimicrobial substances and by phagocytosis . During in ﬂ amma - tion , circulating neutrophils begin to roll on the endothelium , slow down , and are activated by chemokines before adhering and ﬁ nally crawling to the site , where they leave the bloodstream [ 1 , 2 ] . This multistep process , known as extravasation or leukocyte adhesion cascade , involves a plethora of adhesion and signaling molecules in both neutrophils and the endothelium . PSGL - 1 and L - selectin on leukocytes are adhesion molecules that play an important role in leukocyte rolling . Selectin - mediated signaling triggers conforma - tional changes of the b 2 integrin LFA - 1 into its intermediate af ﬁ nity state , enabling slow leukocyte rolling . Chemokine activation then drives further structural changes in LFA - 1 , leading to its fully active , high - af ﬁ nity conformation , facilitating ﬁ rm adhesion of leukocytes to ICAM - 1 on the endothelium [ 3 , 4 ] . In neutrophils , an in ﬂ ammatory stimulus , such as CXCL1 , triggers several signaling pathways that are essential for high - af ﬁ nity activation of LFA - 1 [ 5 ] , such as activation of the small GTPase Rap1 [ 6 ] . Many other signaling and adaptor molecules mediate the conversion of LFA - 1 to its active state , including binding of kindlin - 3 and the ABP talin - 1 to the cytoplasmic tail of LFA - 1 [ 7 ] . Actin cytoskeleton dynamics are important for controlling proper integrin activation [ 8 , 9 ] , and other ABPs , including mammalian ABP1 , also regulate neutrophil adhesion and transmigration [ 10 – 12 ] . However , many other ABPs exist whose roles in leukocyte extravasation have not been explored yet . HS1 is a cortactin homolog speci ﬁ cally expressed in hemato - poietic cells [ 13 ] . It is an ABP that interacts directly with actin - related protein 2 / 3 , F - actin , diverse kinases ( Abl , PI3K , and PLC g ) , and other adaptor / signaling molecules , including Vav1 [ 14 , 15 ] . HS1 is phosphorylated by different kinases of the Src family and Syk in response to in ﬂ ammatory stimuli [ 16 – 18 ] . It is 1 .

Recently , the importance of HS1 for directed cell migration has been demonstrated in dendritic cells and neutrophil - like PLB - 985 cells [ 20 , 21 ] . In NK cells , tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 was crucial for NK cytotoxicity and chemotaxis [ 22 ] . Moreover , HS1 depletion in NK cells led to reduced activation of Rac1 , Rap1 , and Cdc42 . Only very recently , down - regulation of HS1 has been associated with defective transendothelial migration of NK cells in vitro [ 23 ] . Although several studies have demonstrated the importance of HS1 for various cellular processes in different hematopoietic cells [ 24 , 25 ] , not so much is known about the role of HS1 in neutrophils . Therefore , we investigated whether HS1 is important for neutrophil extravasation in vivo . HS1 - de ﬁ cient mice do not exhibit any obvious phenotype [ 26 ] . However , these mice are characterized by a defective clonal expansion of B and T lymphocytes upon antigen receptor engagement . Here , we demonstrate for the ﬁ rst time that HS1 is an important regulator of leukocyte extravasation in vivo by performing intravital microscopy of in ﬂ amed cremaster venules and peritonitis assay . Loss of HS1 led to increased rolling velocity , decreased neutrophil adhesion , and strong inhibition of transmigration . Mechanistically , HS1 de ﬁ ciency caused reduced activation of Rac1 and Rap1 , leading to defects in ICAM - 1 binding and ﬁ rm adhesion . MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice HS1 KO mice were kindly provided by Drs . Klemens Rottner and Daisuke Kitamura [ 26 ] . Age - and sex - matched C57Bl / 6J WT and HS1 KO mice ( 17th backcross to C57Bl / 6J ) were used for experiments . Rac1 KO animals were described before [ 27 ] . Animals were kept in a barrier facility under special pathogen - free conditions , and all animal experiments were approved by the local government ( M¨unster , Germany ) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of CINVESTAV ( Mexico City , Mexico ) . Antibodies and reagents The following primary antibodies were used : monoclonal a - HS1 , phospho - speci ﬁ c and total against PLC g , p38 , Akt , and ERK ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) ; a polyclonal against Rap1 ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) ; and a monoclonal against Rac1 ( clone 102 / Rac1 ; BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) .

APC - coupled anti - hIgG1 was purchased from SouthernBiotech ( Birmingham , AL , USA ) , and the antibody against Fc g R ( clone 2 . 4G2 ) was kindly provided by Dr . Alf Hamann ( Experimental Rheumatology , Charit´e , Berlin , Germany ) . Peroxidase - labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ( West Grove , PA , USA ) . Murine CXCL1 was purchased from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN , USA ) and human TNF - a from PeproTech ( Rocky Hill , NJ , USA ) . Recombinant murine ICAM - 1 - Fc and murine P - selectin - Fc were produced in our lab . PAK - PBD on colored beads was purchased from Cytoskeleton ( Denver , CO , USA ) and Ral GDS - RBD beads from EMD Millipore . Cell culture Murine bone marrow - derived PMNs were isolated as described [ 28 ] . In brief , femurs and tibias were ﬂ ushed with PMN wash buffer ( HBSS containing 10 % FCS and 25 mM HEPES ) . PMNs were separated on a Histopaque 1077 / 1119 ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) gradient and washed 3 times with PMN wash buffer . Cells were either used after overnight cultivation in PMN medium ( DMEM with 10 % WEHI - 3B supernatant , 20 % FCS , 1 % L - glutamine , and penicillin / streptomycin ) or freshly prepared as stated . The endothelioma cell line bEnd5 was cultivated as described [ 29 ] . Intravital microscopy and chemokine - induced arrest WT and HS1 KO mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 125 mg / kg ketamine hydrochloride ( Ketavet ; Zoetis , Parsippany , NJ , USA ) and 12 . 5 mg / kg xylazine ( Rompun 2 % ; Bayer , Leverkusen , Germany ) , and cremaster muscles were prepared for intravital microscopy , as described previously [ 30 ] . The leukocyte transmigration process was monitored after 1 h of 10 nM CXCL1 superfusion or directly after injection of 600 ng CXCL1 via the carotid artery for chemokine - induced arrest . The leukocyte counts after each minute in the chemokine - induced arrest represent the total cumulative numbers of adherent cells per time point . Postcapillary venules with a diameter between 20 and 40 m m were recorded using an intravital upright microscope ( Olympus BX61 W1 ; Olympus , Melville , NY , USA ) with a 20 3 XLUMPlan F1 ( Olympus ) 0 . 95 numerical aperture saline immersion objective . Numbers of rolling and adherent leukocytes were determined by transillumination intravital microscopy , whereas leukocyte extravasation was visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy [ 31 ] . Recorded images were analyzed using ImageJ ( U . S . National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) and AxioVision ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) software . Leukocyte rolling ﬂ ux fraction was calculated as percent of total leukocyte ﬂ ux . Emigrated cells were determined in an area of 75 m m on each side of a vessel over a distance of 100 m m vessel length ( representing 1 . 5 mm 2 tissue area ) . The microcirculation was recorded using a digital camera ( SensiCam QE , PCO - Tech , Romulus , MI , USA ) . Blood ﬂ ow centerline velocity was measured using a dual photodiode sensor system ( CircuSoft Instrumentation , Hockessin , DE , USA ) . Whole blood leukocyte count Murine whole blood samples were collected from cheeks and analyzed for leukocyte countsusinganExigoveterinaryhematologysystem ( Sp ˚ anga , Sweden ) , accordingtothe manufacturer ’ s instructions . In total , 18 WT and 18 HS1 KO male littermates from the Animal Facility at CINVESTAV were analyzed . Peritonitis Peritonitis assays were performed as described previously [ 32 ] . In brief , WT and HS1 KO mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml 3 % thioglycollate ( EMD Millipore ) or PBS . After 4 h , all peritoneal cells were collected by peritoneal lavage and counted using a CASY cell counter ( Roche Innovatis , Bielefeld , Germany ) . To determine PMN number , cells were resuspended in FACS buffer ( PBS with 3 % FCS ) , blocked with anti - Fc g R antibody ( 1 : 100 ) for 20 min on ice , and stained with FITC - conjugated Gr1 antibody ( 1 : 100 ) for 30 min on ice . Afterwards , cells were washed once with FACS buffer and analyzed using a FACSCanto ﬂ ow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) . The total number of PMNs was calculated as percentage of Gr1 - positive cells of the total cell count . Flow cytometry WT and HS1 KO PMNs were stimulated with 40 ng / ml CXCL1 for 1 h or left untreated . Cells were blocked using an anti - Fc g R antibody ( 1 : 100 ) for 5 min at room temperature , centrifuged , and resuspended in FACS buffer . PMNs were stained with Gr1 ( PE - coupled , 1 : 200 dilution ) , CD162 ( PSGL - 1 , PE - coupled , 1 : 300 ) , CD62 ligand ( L - selectin , FITC - coupled , 1 : 200 ) , CD11a ( LFA - 1 , PE - coupled 1 : 200 ) , CD11b ( Mac - 1 , FITC - coupled , 1 : 200 ) , CD182 ( CXCR2 , PE - coupled , 1 : 50 ) , and ICAM - 1 and ICAM - 2 ( FITC - coupled , 1 : 100 ) for 30 min at room temperature . After 3 washes , cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and analyzed using a FACSCanto ﬂ ow cytometer .

Freshly prepared PMNs were resuspended at the concentration of 0 . 25 3 10 6 / ml in HBSS containing 10 mM HEPES and stimulated with 10 ng / ml CXCL1 in the presence of 0 . 5 mM Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + . PMNs ( 1 3 10 6 ) were passed through the slide at a shear stress of 1 dyne / cm 2 with a Harvard Apparatus 2000 pump ( Instech Laboratories , Plymouth Meeting , PA , USA ) . After 4 min , the ﬂ ow was stopped for 4 min to allow the cells to attach . The ﬂ ow was restarted at 0 . 1 dyne / cm 2 and was gradually ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 , 1 , 1 . 5 , 2 , 4 , and ﬁ nally , to 8 dyne / cm 2 ) increased each 60 s . Videos were acquired using an inverted bright - ﬁ eld Axio Observer Z1 microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) , with an objective EC Plan Neo ﬂ uar 10 3 / 0 . 3 Ph1 ( Carl Zeiss ) , a Hamamatsu ORCA C4742 - 80 - 12AG camera ( Shizuoka , Japan ) , and Volocity software ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA , USA ) . All ﬁ rmly adherent cells at each time point were counted at 60 s intervals under different shear - stress levels using ImageJ software . Soluble ICAM - 1 binding PMNs ( 1 3 10 6 ) were resuspended in 30 m l FACS buffer ( HBSS containing 1 mM MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 ) and mixed with 1 . 5 m g ICAM - 1 - Fc conjugated with 0 . 75 m g APC - coupled anti - hIgG1 antibody . Samples were transferred to a ThermoMixer ( Eppendorf , Hauppauge , NY , USA ) and stimulated with 100 ng / ml CXCL1 for 90 s at 37°C while shaking at 300 rpm . The stimulation was terminated by adding 40 m l 7 . 4 % formaldehyde for 10 min on ice . Samples were washed with FACS buffer and stained with 1A8 ( Ly6G - speci ﬁ c ) FITC - coupled antibody ( 1 : 200 ) for 20 min on ice . Cells were washed with FACS buffer , and MFI was measured using FACSCanto . MFI data of bound ICAM - 1 - Fc to HS1 KO PMNs are displayed as percentage of bound ICAM - 1 - Fc to WT PMNs ( set to 100 % ) . Adhesion assays on ICAM - 1 - Fc and P - selectin - Fc Puri ﬁ ed recombinant murine ICAM - 1 , tagged with the human Fc fragment and hIgG as control , were added to 96 - well Costar tissue - culture plates at a concentration of 10 m g / ml in PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature for protein immobilization . Wells were then blocked with DMEM containing 10 % low IgG FCS for 1 h . Freshly isolated PMNs were ﬂ uorescently labeled with 2 9 , 7 9 - bis - ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) - 5 - ( and - 6 ) - carboxy ﬂ uorescein ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Karlsruhe , Germany ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions , and added to the coated wells ( 1 3 10 5 cells / well in a total volume of 100 m l ) , followed by stationary incubation , with or without 40 ng / ml CXCL1 for 30 min at 37°C . After 3 washes with PBS , PMN adhesion was quanti ﬁ ed using a spectro ﬂ uorometer ( Synergy 2 ; BioTek , Bad Friedrichshall , Germany ) . For P - selectin adhesion assays , 96 - well Nunc MaxiSorp plates were coated with 5 m g / ml P - selectin - Fc or hIgG overnight at 4°C and blocked the next day for 1 h with DMEM containing 10 % low IgG FCS . Freshly isolated PMNs ( 1 . 2 3 10 5 ) were resuspended in 100 m l PBS with 1 mM MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 , with or without 100 ng / ml CXCL1 . Cells were directly added to the wells and allowed to adhere for 20 min at 4°C under shear - stress conditions of 80 rpm . Next , all of the wells were gently washed several times , and ﬁ rmly attached PMNs were visualized on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 - U microscope and counted using ImageJ . Transmigration assay For PMN transmigration experiments , con ﬂ uent bEnd5 monolayers were activated for 16 h with 5 nM TNF - a . On the day of the assay , bEnd5 cells were washed with migration assay medium ( DMEM containing 20 % FCS and 25 mM HEPES ) , and freshly prepared 0 . 5 3 10 6 PMNs in 100 m l migration assay medium were added on top of the Costar Transwell ﬁ lter ( 5 m m pore ) . The bottom well contained either 40 ng / ml CXCL1 or no chemokine . After 45 min , numbers of transmigrated PMNs in the lower reservoirs were quanti ﬁ ed using a CASY cell counter . PMN transmigration into lower reservoirs is expressed as percentage of total applied PMNs . Random motility bEnd5 cells ( 8 3 10 5 ) were seeded onto gelatin - coated Ibidi dishes ( 35 mm 2 with glass insert ) , 2 d before the assay . After 16 h of stimulation with 5 nM TNF - a , 1 3 10 6 PMNs were added , and a 20 min video was recorded using an inverted bright - ﬁ eld Axio Observer Z1 microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) at 6 frames / min from 4 ﬁ elds . Trajectories of 40 cells / condition were analyzed using ImageJ . Transwell chemotaxis assay PMNs ( 0 . 7 3 10 6 ) in 100 m l chemotaxis medium ( 0 . 5 % FCS with 20 mM HEPES in HBSS ) were added on top of the Costar Transwell ﬁ lters ( 5 m m pore ) , and 40 ng / ml CXCL1 was added to the bottom well . Cells were allowed to migrate toward the chemokine gradient for 30 min and counted using a CASY cell counter . Chemotaxis assay PMNs ( 1 3 10 6 ) were suspended in 0 . 5 ml RPMI 1640 and plated onto glass coverslips coated with 2 . 5 m g / ml ﬁ bronectin ( Takara Bio , Kusatsu / Shiga , Japan ) , incubated for 30 min at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . After gentle washing with PBS , coverslips were placed upside down onto a Zigmond chamber , where one of the grooves was ﬁ lled with RPMI medium and the other with RPMI containing 100 ng / ml CXCL1 . The Zigmond chamber was placed onto an Axio Scope A1 microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) , and a real - time video was captured using a 40 3 objective for 1 h . The polarity index represents the elongation of the cells ( 100 cells of each sample ) , analyzed using the Circularity tool of Image J . The graph depicts data in a way that a score of 0 represents round cells and the higher the score , the more elongated the cells . To measure migration distance , 50 cells of each WT and HS1 KO PMN were tracked using ImageJ software and analyzed using the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool software v2 . 0 ( Ibidi ) . Western blotting PMNs were either treated with 100 ng / ml CXCL1 for 45 s or left untreated and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer . Equal protein amounts of cell lysates were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene di ﬂ uoride membranes ( EMD Millipore ) . After incubation for 1 h in TBST , containing either 5 % skim milk or 3 % BSA for blocking ( in the case of blots for phosphorylated proteins and Rap1 pull - down assays ) , membranes were incubated in primary antibodies at 4°C overnight , washed 3 times in TBST for 10 min , and incubated with species - speci ﬁ c peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h . Chemiluminescence signals were recorded on Hyper ﬁ lm X - ray ﬁ lms ( GE Healthcare , Freiburg , Germany ) . The quanti ﬁ cation of the phosphorylation levels of speci ﬁ c kinases shows the mean values of phospho - speci ﬁ c band intensities normalized to the total level of the speci ﬁ c protein . Pixel intensities were analyzed using MultiGauge V3 . 2 software . Rap1 and Rac1 activity assays Activity of Rap1 was assessed using a Ral GDS - RBD domain on agarose beads ( EMD Millipore ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions , using a different lysis buffer : 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 % NP - 40 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 20 mM NaF , 1 mM PMSF , and cOmplete protease inhibitors EDTA free ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) . PMNs were stimulated for 10 , 45 , or 90 s with 100 ng / ml CXCL1 or left untreated , lysed , and subjected to the pull - down with 20 m l Ral GDS - RBD beads for 45 min at 4°C . For Rac1 activation , PMNs were lysed using a buffer containing the following : 1 % NP - 40 , 25 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 2 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM PMSF , and cOmplete with EDTA . Cells were stimulated for 30 s with CXCL1 or left untreated , lysed , and incubated with 25 m l PAK - PBD agarose beads for 35 min at 4°C . The relative values of Rap1 and Rac1 GTP were normalized to the amount of binding domains ( Ral GDS - RBD or PAK - PBD , respectively ) in each sample and total GTPase levels in whole cell lysates . Quanti ﬁ cations show the differences between fold increases in Rap1 or Rac1 activation after chemokine stimulation compared with untreated samples .

Statistical signi ﬁ cance was assessed by Student ’ s t test or Mann - Whitney test when the normality test failed using SigmaPlot 11 . 0 software ( Systat Software , San Jose , CA , USA ) .

RESULTS Loss of HS1 affects neutrophil extravasation at different steps in vivo The role of HS1 in neutrophil transmigration in vivo has not been investigated previously . To better understand the function of this protein , we analyzed extravasation of neutrophils in the in ﬂ amed cremaster muscle by intravital microscopy . We observed that rolling velocity of neutrophils was increased by 28 % ( 6 34 % ; Fig . 1A ) , whereas the rolling ﬂ ux fraction was not affected ( Fig . 1B ) . Firm adhesion of neutrophils ( Fig . 1C ) to postcapillary venules was signi ﬁ cantly reduced by 40 % ( 6 17 % ) , whereas neutrophil extravasation was even more strongly inhibited by 53 % ( 6 12 . 9 % ) in HS1 KO mice ( Fig . 1D ) , suggesting that HS1 not only affects adhesive interactions on the apical endothelial surface but also the actual transmigration step . Wall shear rate of analyzed vessels and other hemodynamic parameters , such as total leukocyte count and vessel diameter , were not altered and within the physiologic range , as described for C57Bl / 6J WT mice ( Table 1 ) [ 33 ] . We conclude that the transition from rolling to ﬁ rm adhesion occurs less ef ﬁ ciently in HS1 KO mice , leading to a defect in neutrophil arrest . Thus , HS1 is required for optimal interactions of neutrophils with the vascular endothelium during different steps of the extravasation cascade . To determine whether the observed differences could be a result of altered cell numbers in the blood , we performed hemograms of whole blood samples from 18 HS1 KO and 18 WT male littermates . As shown in Table 2 , we found no signi ﬁ cant differences in total leukocyte count , number of platelets , lymphocytes , monocytes , and hematocrit or hemo - globin levels . In contrast to previously published data [ 34 ] , we even observed a signi ﬁ cantly higher neutrophil count in the absence of HS1 , suggesting that the observed defects in transmigration were not a result of reduced leukocyte counts . This is in line with previously published studies in which KO mouse models , such as CD18 KO and ICAM - 1 KO , which are characterized by decreased adhesion and diapedesis , also had elevated neutrophil levels [ 35 , 36 ] . To investigate HS1 effects on leukocyte recruitment in another in vivo model of transmigration that is reportedly dependent on LFA - 1 activation [ 37 ] , we performed peritonitis assays . We observed that loss of HS1 led to a signi ﬁ cant 44 % ( 6 11 % ) reduction of neutrophil recruitment into the peritoneal cavity in response to thioglycollate ( Fig . 1E ) . These results further Figure 1 . HS1 is required for neutrophil rolling , adhesion , and transmigration in vivo . The velocity of rolling cells ( A ) , the rolling ﬂ ux fraction ( B ) , the number of ﬁ rmly adherent cells ( C ) , and the number of transmigrated cells ( D ) were investigated by intravital microscopy of cremaster muscle venules of HS1 KO and C57Bl / 6J ( WT ) mice , 1 h after 10 nM CXCL1 superfusion .

Given that neutrophil rolling and adhesion were strongly affected in the absence of HS1 , we examined whether the expression of surface markers was altered . Importantly , ﬂ ow cytometry analysis revealed that surface expression of Gr1 , PSGL - 1 , L - selectin , LFA - 1 , Mac - 1 , CXCR2 , ICAM - 1 , and ICAM - 2 on untreated and CXCL1 - treated HS1 KO neutrophils was compa - rable with that of the respective WT cells ( Fig . 1F ) . Therefore , we exclude a differential expression pattern of these molecules as the reason for the observed defects in HS1 - de ﬁ cient cells . Activation of the b 2 integrin LFA - 1 is impaired in the absence of HS1 during adhesion in vivo and in vitro Next , we investigated whether HS1 plays a role in in vivo activation of LFA - 1 in the initial adhesion step of the leukocyte extravasation cascade . To this end , we performed chemokine - induced arrest assays in vivo , in which GPCR - induced integrin activation leads to immediate leukocyte attachment to cremaster venules . In WT mice , we observed a strong increase in the number of adhering neutrophils 60 s after CXCL1 injection ( Fig . 2A ) . By contrast , CXCL1 - induced arrest of neutrophils in HS1 KO mice was reduced by 33 % ( 6 19 % ) . Thus , HS1 is required for proper chemokine - induced GPCR signaling leading to LFA - 1 activation . To investigate whether HS1 is also important for shear - stress resistance of neutrophil adhesion , we performed adhesion assays under ﬂ ow conditions with gradually increasing shear - stress levels [ 38 ] . Previous studies have shown that some ABPs play a role in shear - stress sensing [ 8 , 38 , 39 ] . We observed that CXCL1 - activated WT neutrophils started attaching to P - selectin - and ICAM - 1 - Fc - coated ﬂ ow chambers under a physiologic shear - stress condition of 1 dyne / cm 2 and ﬁ rmly adhered to the surface during a subsequent period of 4 min without any shear stress ( Fig . 2B ) . WT neutrophils gradually detached from the surface , with 20 % ( 6 5 % ) of initially adherent neutrophils missing after restarting the ﬂ ow and increasing the shear stress gradually to 8 dyne / cm 2 . We observed that HS1 KO neutrophils adhered 29 . 5 % ( 6 13 % ) less to ICAM - 1 - and P - selectin - coated surfaces compared with WT cells . Importantly , we detected a similar tendency in HS1 KO neutrophil detachment after applying gradually in - creasing shear stress ( decrease from 70 . 5 to 55 % in KO vs . 100 to 80 % in WT ; Fig . 2B ) . Thus , HS1 is important for the initial arrest of neutrophils after shear , but it does not seem to be required for adhesion strengthening under ﬂ ow conditions . To investigate further whether HS1 is necessary for activation of LFA - 1 , we performed a soluble ICAM - 1 binding assay in vitro . As shown in Fig . 2C , binding of soluble ICAM - 1 to WT PMNs upon CXCL1 treatment was strongly increased , as expected . Notably , binding of ICAM - 1 - Fc to HS1 KO PMNs was reduced by 32 % ( 6 17 % ) compared with WT PMNs . These results suggest that HS1 is required for full LFA - 1 activation to enable proper ICAM - 1 binding and neutrophil adhesion . In vitro adhesion to ICAM - 1 , transmigration , and chemotaxis are reduced in the absence of HS1 , whereas adhesion to P - selectin and random motility are not affected Our ﬁ ndings suggest that the defect in neutrophil extravasation in HS1 - de ﬁ cient mice is in part a result of impaired leukocyte - endothelial interactions on the apical surface . To investigate further the function of HS1 , we performed in vitro adhesion and transmigration assays . As ICAM - 1 is the major endothelial ligand for neutrophil LFA - 1 during arrest and given the fact that soluble ICAM - 1 binds less to HS1 KO PMNs ( Fig . 2C ) , we also tested static adhesion of HS1 KO neutrophils to ICAM - 1 - coated TABLE 1 .

Latasiewicz et al . HS1 facilitates neutrophil extravasation www . jleukbio . org Volume 101 , May 2017 Journal of Leukocyte Biology 1137 surfaces . We observed that HS1 KO neutrophils adhered to recombinant ICAM - 1 less effectively than WT cells , and this effect was even more pronounced in the presence of the chemokine CXCL1 ( Fig . 3A ) . CXCL1 - activated HS1 KO PMNs showed a 37 % ( 6 8 % ) decrease in adhesion to ICAM - 1 compared with chemokine - stimulated WT cells . To make sure that the observed defects in LFA - 1 - mediated adhesion are not a result of reduced P - selectin binding , we analyzed PMN adhesion on a P - selectin - coated surface . As shown in Fig . 3B , HS1 KO PMNs adhered to P - selectin - Fc with the same ef ﬁ ciency as WT cells , regardless of CXCL1 stimulation . Thus , we conclude that in contrast to ICAM - 1 , HS1 does not affect adhesion to P - selectin . Moreover , we performed static transmigration assays , with TNF - a - activated bEnd5 cells grown on Transwell ﬁ lters , in the presence or absence of CXCL1 . WT neutrophils showed a strong increase in transmigration with 60 % ( 6 10 . 5 % ) of total applied cells migrating toward a CXCL1 gradient ( Fig . 3C ) . By contrast , only 16 % ( 6 2 . 4 % ) of total administered HS1 KO neutrophils transmigrated toward CXCL1 and crossed the endothelial cell monolayers . These data con ﬁ rm our in vivo observation that HS1 mediates neutrophil transmigration in response to CXCL1 . Next , we wanted to know whether HS1 KO neutrophils show defective migratory behavior . Whereas random motility of HS1 KO neutrophils on bEnd5 monolayers was unaffected ( Fig . 3D ) , absence of HS1 led to a decrease in chemotaxis by 28 % ( 6 13 . 5 % ) compared with WT neutrophils in a Transwell assay ( Fig . 3E ) . In addition , we performed chemotaxis assays using a Zigmond chamber to analyze cell trajectories and polarity indices . We observed that HS1 KO PMNs only migrated distances ; 11 times shorter than WT cells ( 30 vs . 344 m m ; Fig . 3F ) . Moreover , the polarity index ( highlighting the polarization of neutrophils toward the chemokine gradient ) of HS1 KO PMNs was signi ﬁ cantly lower compared with WT PMNs ( 0 . 07 vs . 0 . 21 ; Fig . 3G ) . Our data are consistent with previous results from the myeloid cell line PLB - 985 [ 21 ] and NK cells [ 22 ] and demonstrate that HS1 is important for chemokine - driven migration but not for random movement of primary neutrophils . HS1 does not affect the activation of kinases implicated in chemokine - induced neutrophil activation but plays an important role in the activation of the small GTPases Rap1 and Rac1 CXCL1 stimulation activates signaling pathways downstream of CXCR2 , including phosphorylation of kinases and activation of small GTPases of the Rho and Ras families [ 5 ] that lead to LFA - 1 activation [ 4 , 40 ] . With the consideration of these ﬁ ndings , we analyzed which of these signaling steps would be affected by HS1 de ﬁ ciency . First , we investigated the phosphorylation of the kinases Akt , ERK , p38 , and PLC g in WT and HS1 KO neutrophils upon CXCL1 stimulation . As shown in Fig . 4A , we did not detect any signi ﬁ cant differences in the activation of these kinases in HS1 KO cells . Next , we analyzed the activation of Rap1 , as it is a critical step in LFA - 1 activation [ 6 ] . To compare the activation levels , pixel intensities of Rap1 GTP signals were quanti ﬁ ed and normalized to both total Rap1 and the content of assay reagent in the samples . Values of HS1 KO samples were then compared with the WT samples , with 45 - s CXCL1 - treated WT PMNs set to 100 % . We observed that Rap1 is activated within 10 s of CXCL1 stimulation , reaching a peak of activation after 45 s and subsequent reduction of signal strength already after 90 s . The strong increase in Rap1 activation in response to CXCL1 in WT neutrophils after 45 s was signi ﬁ cantly reduced by 42 % ( 6 8 % ) in HS1 KO neutrophils ( Fig . 4B ) . Additionally , we investigated the activation of Rac1 , which also has been recently shown to act upstream of LFA - 1 activation [ 40 ] . Figure 2 .

Rac1 GTP levels in WT neutrophils treated for 30 s with CXCL1 were 3 . 6 - fold higher compared with untreated cells ( Fig . 4C ) . By contrast , Rac1 activation in CXCL1 - treated HS1 KO cells was only 2 . 1 - fold higher . We conclude that HS1 is required for the activation of both Rac1 and Rap1 in chemokine - stimulated neutrophils . Rac1 is required for full Rap1 activation Furthermore , we tested whether Rac1 is upstream of Rap1 in chemokine - stimulated neutrophils . With the use of Rac1 KO neutrophils [ 41 ] , we found that CXCL1 treatment activated Rap1 to a lesser extent in these cells ( Fig . 5 ) . Rap1 GTP levels were signi ﬁ cantly reduced by 54 % ( 6 15 % ) in Rac1 KO neutrophils compared with WT cells , suggesting that Rac1 is required for proper activation of Rap1 . Our data imply that Rac1 acts upstream of Rap1 in primary neutrophils , similar to what has been observed in platelets [ 42 ] . DISCUSSION Impressive progress has been made in recent years in identifying adhesion and signaling molecules that participate in the guidance of leukocytes through the blood vessel wall . However , few studies have aimed at understanding how ABP works in concert with intracellular signaling pathways and surface receptors in neutrophils during extravasation [ 38 , 39 ] . By studying in ﬂ amed cremaster venules by intravital microscopy in HS1 KO mice , we demonstrate for the ﬁ rst time that this hematopoietic cell - speci ﬁ c ABP is important for proper neutro - phil recruitment . Loss of HS1 leads to an increased rolling velocity and a decrease of neutrophil adhesion to the vessel wall . Additionally , recruitment of HS1 KO PMNs is reduced during peritonitis , suggesting that HS1 is required for proper neutrophil – endothelial interactions during transmigration . This adhesion defect is likely caused by defective activation of the small GTPases Rac1 and Rap1 . We recently demonstrated that cortactin is required for ef ﬁ cient neutrophil extravasation and proper activation of Rap1 and RhoG in endothelial cells [ 43 ] . Thus , it seems that besides their role in actin remodeling , HS1 and cortactin play a general and so far underestimated role in GTPase - mediated intracellular signaling in both neutrophils and endothelium during neutro - phil extravasation . The neutrophil extravasation cascade is a complex process comprised of consecutive neutrophil capturing , rolling , adhesion , and transmigration that requires the interplay of selectins , integrins , and several other adhesion molecules with their Figure 3 . Lack of HS1 affects PMN adhesion to ICAM - 1 , transmigration and chemotaxis but has no effect on adhesion to P - selectin and random motility in vitro .

Latasiewicz et al . HS1 facilitates neutrophil extravasation www . jleukbio . org Volume 101 , May 2017 Journal of Leukocyte Biology 1139 respective ligands [ 44 ] . The increased rolling velocity that we observed in vivo suggests that HS1 is needed for the slowing down of rolling neutrophils , which is known to require the transition of LFA - 1 into its extended conformation with the closed I domain [ 4 ] . Subsequently , neutrophil arrest requires further conforma - tional changes of LFA - 1 into its extended conformation with the open I domain [ 7 ] , which is also affected in HS1 KO mice given the observed in vivo defects in leukocyte arrest and ﬁ rm adhesion , as well as the reduced binding of soluble ICAM - 1 - Fc in vitro . Our in vitro experiments con ﬁ rmed an important role of HS1 in transmigration and adhesion under static and ﬂ ow conditions . We detected a 44 % decrease in transmigration of HS1 KO neutrophils through bEnd5 cell monolayers compared with WT cells . This is in agreement with previous data showing that only 50 % of HS1 - depleted NK cells transmigrated across endothelial monolayers compared with control cells [ 23 ] . By contrast , contradictory data on adhesion defects caused by down - regulation of HS1 have been reported . Whereas adhesion of HS1 - depleted PLB - 985 cells to ﬁ bronectin , ﬁ brinogen , or ICAM - 1 - coated surfaces was not affected [ 21 ] , HS1 - depleted NK cells showed reduced adhesion to ICAM - 1 but no difference in adhesion to ﬁ bronectin [ 22 ] . In our study , adhesion of neutrophils to ICAM - 1 in vitro and to postcapillary venules in vivo was strongly reduced . As the in vivo tests determined rapidly induced chemokine - triggered leukocyte arrest , our results suggest that activation of LFA - 1 via induction of its extended conformation with the open I domain requires HS1 . This interpretation was con ﬁ rmed in the in vitro ICAM - 1 - binding assay , in which HS1 KO neutrophils bound 32 % less ICAM - 1 - Fc than WT cells after CXCL1 stimulation . This result is in agreement with data in human NK cells , where loss of HS1 led to defects in binding of mAb24 antibody , which recognizes only the A 75 150 PLCγ phospho - specific signal total protein - CXCL1 - CXCL1 WT HS1 KO WT HS1 KO - CXCL1 - CXCL1 100 120 k i na s e s [ % ] n . s . n . s . n . s . n . s . 75 Akt 37 p38 75 HS1 37 ERK 0 20 40 60 80 p - PLCγ p - Akt p - ERK p - p38 C X C L1 a c t i v a t i on o f k c o m pa r ed t o W T [ 80 100 120 140 WTHS1 KO n s * * * * * * * * n . s . a c t i v a t i on [ % ] B 20 - 10s 45s 90s - 10s 45s 90s CXCL1 HS1 KO WT Relativevalues [ % ] 283 390 619 672 139 585 100 547 Rap1 GTP 0 20 40 60 80 untr 10 s CXCL1 45 s CXCL1 90 s CXCL1 n . s . n . s . no r m a li z ed R ap1 Rap1 WCL Relative values [ % ] 28 . 3 39 . 0 61 . 9 67 . 2 13 . 9 58 . 5 100 54 . 7 37 20 Ral GDS - RBD 40 60 80 100 120 d R a c 1 a c t i v a t i on [ % ] * * * C Relative values 1 3 . 6 1 . 3 2 . 8 20 Rac1 GTP WT HS1 KO 37 PAK - PBD - CXCL1 - CXCL1 0 20 40 WT + CXCL1 HS1 KO + CXCL1 no r m a li z e Rac1 WCL 20 Figure 4 .

We could exclude that HS1 is also required for ligand - induced adhesion strengthening , as our in vitro adhesion assays under ﬂ ow conditions revealed that although HS1 KO neutrophils adhered less ef ﬁ ciently to ICAM - 1 - coated surfaces than WT neutrophils , the gene - de ﬁ cient neu - trophils resisted enhanced ﬂ ow conditions , as well as WT neutrophils , and were not detached more easily . The role of HS1 in random motility and chemotaxis of other hematopoietic cells has been investigated before . Down - regulation of HS1 was associated with a decrease in the chemotactic index in dendritic cells and PLB - 985 cells [ 20 , 21 ] . Additionally , HS1 - depleted NK cells and T cells showed reduced chemokine - triggered migration , whereas random motility was not affected [ 22 , 45 ] . Our experiments now con ﬁ rm the importance of HS1 in primary neutrophils for chemotaxis and the lack of relevance for random motility . Furthermore , we investigated the intracellular signaling re - quired for proper integrin - mediated adhesion . It is well known that Rap1 is a crucial regulator of LFA - 1 activation [ 4 , 6 ] . More recently , other members of the Rho family have been implicated in inside - out activation of this b 2 integrin [ 27 , 40 , 46 ] . For example , in T cells , as well as in neutrophils , chemokine - triggered Rac1 activation was required for proper inside - out activation of LFA - 1 and subsequent adhesion [ 27 , 40 ] . Addi - tionally , chemokine - induced arrest assays in Rac1 KO mice revealed that neutrophils were not able to adhere to postcapillary venules after CXCL1 injection [ 27 ] . It was shown previously that activation of Rac1 was decreased in HS1 - depleted PLB - 985 cells adhering to ﬁ brinogen and stimu - lated with fMLP [ 21 ] . Likewise , CXCL12 - stimulated NK cells adhering to ﬁ bronectin showed a reduction of Rac1 activation when lacking HS1 [ 22 ] . Moreover , loss of HS1 led to diminished activation of Rac1 and Rap1 in NK cells downstream of LFA - 1 - mediated adhesion to ICAM - 1 . These ﬁ ndings implied that HS1 acts upstream of these GTPases during chemotaxis on a solid support . Whether Rac1 and Rap1 activation is related to each other was not analyzed . Here , we show that in primary neutrophils , HS1 is required for the activation of Rac1 and Rap1 in response to CXCL1 . Importantly , these assays were done in suspension , thus inside - out signaling was analyzed without an additional contribution by outside - in signaling via integrins . Furthermore , we provide evidence that Rac1 acts upstream of Rap1 activation in CXCL1 - stimulated neutrophils , as we found a signi ﬁ cantly reduced activation of Rap1 in Rac1 KO neutrophils . This is in line with ﬁ ndings in platelets where Rac1 can also act upstream of Rap1 [ 42 ] . On the other hand , our ﬁ ndings differ from previously published data in T cells , where dominant - negative Rac1 Tat peptides did not in ﬂ uence the activation of Rap1 upon CXCL12 stimulation [ 46 ] . However , it should be noted that signaling pathways leading to LFA - 1 activation and cell adhesion may differ among various leukocyte types and activation stimuli . Furthermore , we observed only a 54 % reduction of Rap1 activation in Rac1 KO neutrophils , suggesting that additional chemokine - induced signaling pathways can activate Rap1 in - dependently of Rac1 activation , similar to what has been observed in platelets [ 42 ] . Together with previously published data , our ﬁ ndings strongly argue that both Rac1 and Rap1 are indispensable for proper leukocyte adhesion and that HS1 contributes to their activation , thus facilitating leukocyte – endothelial interactions . By studying the roles of HS1 , HS1 - associated protein X - 1 , and lymphoid enhancer - binding factor 1 in granulopoiesis , Skokowa and colleagues [ 34 ] reported mild neutropenia in HS1 KO mice . To exclude that our defects in transmigration were a result of a lower number of neutrophils , we performed hemograms of 18 WT and 18 HS1 KO mice . We did not observe any decrease in the total number of circulating leukocytes . In contrast to the reported data , we even detected a signi ﬁ cant increase in neutrophil numbers in HS1 KO mice . This is in line with results on other KO mice lacking important adhesion molecules that regulate the transmigration process ( such as CD18 and ICAM - 1 ) , which show the same tendency toward higher neutrophil counts in the circulation [ 35 , 36 ] . The discrepancy between our data and results published by Skokowa and colleagues [ 34 ] can presently not be explained but might be a result of differences in animal housing , determination of cell counts , or ways of taking the blood samples . Thus , the defects in neutrophil extravasation that we observed in HS1 - de ﬁ cient mice are not a result of decreased neutrophil counts in the circulation . In conclusion , we provide evidence that loss of HS1 leads to severe defects in the leukocyte adhesion cascade , affecting neutrophil rolling velocity , adhesion , and transmigration in vivo . HS1 is required for initial LFA - 1 - mediated adhesion and chemotactic migration of neutrophils . HS1 acts upstream of Rac1 and Rap1 in the pathway leading to inside - out activation of LFA - 1 . We also demonstrate that in neutrophils , Rac1 triggers Rap1 activation and therefore , supports LFA - 1 - mediated adhesion . Our results establish HS1 as an important component of the molecular machinery that controls neutrophil extravasation to sites of in ﬂ ammation . AUTHORSHIP J . L . and M .
