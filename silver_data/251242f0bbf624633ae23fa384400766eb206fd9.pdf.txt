In the case 33 of epithelial microvilli , mitotic spindle positioning protein ( MISP ) is an actin bundler that 34 localizes specifically to the basal rootlets , where the pointed ends of core bundle filaments 35 converge . Previous studies established that MISP is prevented from binding more distal 36 segments of the core bundle by competition with other actin binding proteins . Yet whether 37 MISP holds a preference for binding directly to rootlet actin remains an open question . 38 Using in vitro TIRF microscopy assays , we found that MISP exhibits a clear binding 39 preference for filaments enriched in ADP - actin monomers . Consistent with this , assays 40 with actively growing actin filaments revealed that MISP binds at or near their pointed 41 ends . Moreover , although substrate attached MISP assembles filament bundles in 42 parallel and antiparallel configurations , in solution MISP assembles parallel bundles 43 consisting of multiple filaments exhibiting uniform polarity . These discoveries highlight 44 nucleotide state sensing as a mechanism for sorting actin bundlers along filaments and 45 driving their accumulation near filament ends . Such localized binding might drive parallel 46 bundle formation and / or locally modulate bundle mechanical properties in microvilli and 47 related protrusions . 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 3 INTRODUCTION 62 Actin filament assemblies provide structural support for a variety of cell surface features , 63 which mediate interactions with the external environment in diverse biological contexts . 64 Two general architectures include actin meshworks and bundles ; meshworks generate 65 large mechanical forces , such as those needed for leading edge protrusion during cell 66 motility , whereas bundles generate localized forces that can power the extension of 67 fingerlike membrane protrusions . 1 , 2 Examples of the latter case include filopodia , which 68 extend from crawling cells to promote surface attachment and control steering . 3 Other 69 well - studied protrusions that are supported by actin bundles include microvilli , which 70 extend from the apex of solute - transporting epithelial cells , 4 , 5 and morphologically related 71 stereocilia , which comprise the mechanosensory hair bundle that resides at the functional 72 surface of cochlear and vestibular hair cells . 6 In all three of these cases , individual 73 protrusions are supported by a core bundle consisting of multiple actin filaments , ranging 74 from ~ 25 for microvilli up to 100s for stereocilia . 7 – 9 Multiple filaments are needed because 75 individual polymers exhibit a flexural rigidity that is too low to support plasma membrane 76 deformation . 10 By bundling multiple filaments together with cell - type specific factors , cells 77 create more rigid structures that promote and maintain membrane protrusion without 78 buckling . 79 A defining feature of a protrusion core bundle is the uniform polarity of its 80 constituent actin filaments . In all cases , actin filament barbed ends are oriented out into 81 the distal tip of the protrusion , whereas the pointed ends extend down into the 82 cytoplasm . 11 , 12 Importantly , the critical concentration for incorporation of ATP - actin ( the 83 most abundant form of monomer in the cytoplasm ) is much lower at the barbed relative 84 to the pointed end ( 0 . 12 vs . 0 . 6 µM , respectively ) . 13 The differential kinetic properties at 85 the two ends fuel dynamic behaviors such as treadmilling , where new ATP - actin 86 monomers incorporate at the barbed end , flux through the polymer where hydrolysis 87 occurs , and then exit from the pointed ends in the ADP - bound form . 14 Filament networks 88 that exhibit treadmilling also generate mechanical force at their growing barbed ends , 89 which can be harnessed to power subcellular and cell scale activities ranging from the 90 motion of vesicles and endomembranes to the leading - edge protrusion that powers cell 91 motility . 15 , 16 Treadmilling has also been observed in core bundles that support fingerlike 92 4 protrusions . For instance , filopodia are supported by core bundles that exhibit robust 93 treadmilling , 17 and newly formed microvilli on differentiating epithelial cells also 94 demonstrate treadmilling , 18 , 19 which powers their gliding motility across the apical 95 surface . 20 How the behaviors of individual filaments in treadmilling parallel actin bundles 96 are coordinated remains unclear , although in vitro studies implicate factors with 97 multivalent filament binding potential , such as VASP at filament barbed ends . 21 98 In addition to creating a kinetic scenario that supports treadmilling , the eventual 99 hydrolysis of ATP in newly incorporated monomers at the barbed end creates a gradient 100 of nucleotide states consisting of ATP - , ADP - Pi - , and ADP - bound actin along the length 101 of an actively growing filament . 22 This gradient in nucleotide composition also impacts the 102 physical properties of the filament , such as flexibility , which is increased in older polymer 103 that is rich in ADP - actin . 23 , 24 The nucleotide landscape of an actin filament might also 104 impact where regulatory and network building proteins are able to bind . One established 105 example of this type of “sorting” is found in studies of cofilin , a ubiquitously expressed 106 filament severing protein that only binds to older ADP - actin . 25 In contrast , coronin - 1B 107 displays a binding preference for ATP and ADP - Pi - bound actin . 26 , 27 Another well - studied 108 factor is the Arp2 / 3 complex , which crosslinks newly polymerizing filaments to the sides 109 of pre - existing filaments in the ATP and ADP - Pi states . 28 Although the nucleotide - 110 dependent targeting and function of these factors have provided a mechanistic framework 111 to understand how branched actin networks are built and recycled , 1 whether actin 112 nucleotide states also control the formation and organization of parallel bundles , like 113 those that shape membrane protrusions , remain unexplored . 114 Interestingly , the bundling proteins that comprise microvillar core bundles - fimbrin , 115 espin , villin , and MISP – do localize to different segments along the length of the 116 structure . 29 , 30 While espin and villin localize along the full length of the core bundle , as 117 expected for canonical bundlers , 31 , 32 fimbrin seems to prefer the basal half . 29 Unlike these 118 bundlers , MISP exclusively decorates the rootlets . 30 Although the selective localization of 119 MISP is partially dependent on ezrin’s membrane - actin crosslinking activity , 30 whether 120 intrinsic features of core bundle actin filaments , such as monomer nucleotide state , 121 contribute to the sorting of MISP or other bundlers remains an open question . 122 5 In this study , we report that MISP exhibits an intrinsic ability for binding directly to 123 rootlet actin . Using in vitro reconstitution assays coupled with total internal reflection 124 fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , we found that MISP demonstrates a clear binding 125 preference for filaments enriched in ADP - actin , and assays with actively growing actin 126 filaments revealed that MISP binds at or near their pointed ends . Bundling assays also 127 revealed that MISP can organize multiple actin filaments into a parallel bundle , a feature 128 that is likely conferred by its pointed end binding ability . These findings implicate sensing 129 of actin nucleotide states in the specific targeting of MISP to microvillar rootlets , and 130 further suggest that MISP may play a role in organizing nascent filaments in a parallel 131 fashion at early stages of microvillar assembly . 132 133 RESULTS 134 Microvillar core bundle rootlets are enriched in ADP - actin 135 In cultured epithelial model systems , the core actin bundles that support nascent microvilli 136 undergo treadmilling , 18 – 20 and thus their rootlets are expected to be enriched in ADP - 137 actin . To determine if the rootlets of mature microvilli in native tissue are also enriched in 138 ADP - actin , we immunostained mouse small intestinal tissue with antibodies targeting 139 cofilin , a severing protein that specifically binds to actin in the ADP - bound state . 25 , 33 140 Confocal microscopy of the resulting tissue sections revealed that cofilin is highly 141 enriched on microvillar rootlets in a pattern that closely resembles MISP localization as 142 we previously reported ( Figure S1A , B ) . 30 Thus , in vivo MISP binds to filaments that 143 appear to be enriched in ADP - actin . 144 145 MISP dissociates slowly from ADP - actin enriched filaments 146 Strong colocalization of cofilin and MISP on microvillar rootlets suggests that MISP may 147 prefer binding to filaments enriched in ADP - actin monomers . To directly test this 148 possibility , we turned to in vitro reconstitution assays with purified proteins using TIRF 149 microscopy . We purified a MBP - EGFP tagged version of MISP ( herein referred to as 150 ‘MISP’ ) as previously described 30 and generated biotin - rhodamine - labeled actin filaments 151 enriched with monomers in three distinct nucleotide states . ADP - actin and ADP - Pi - actin 152 filaments were generated using phalloidin as previously described ( Figure 1A , B ; top 153 6 row ) . 34 To mimic the ATP state , we used AMP - PNP as a nucleotide analog ( Figure 1C ; 154 top row ) . Importantly , we previously showed that phalloidin labeling does not disrupt 155 MISP’s interaction with filaments . 30 To determine if MISP’s dissociation from filaments is 156 impacted by monomer nucleotide state , MISP was introduced at low concentrations ( 16 . 5 157 nM ) to surface bound filaments in each nucleotide state and binding event lifetimes were 158 measured directly using kymography . Notably , MISP dwell times on ADP - actin enriched 159 filaments were significantly longer relative to filaments enriched in ADP - Pi - or AMP - PNP - 160 actin , respectively ( 10 . 72 s [ 95 % CI = 10 . 15 – 11 . 33 ] ; 6 . 78 s [ 95 % CI = 6 . 13 – 7 . 50 ] ; 5 . 83 161 s [ 95 % CI = 5 . 53 – 6 . 14 ] ) ( Figure 1A - F ; S1F ) . Consistently , the number of events longer 162 than 60 seconds was also significantly higher in the ADP condition relative to ADP - Pi and 163 AMP - PNP ( Figure S1G ) . We note here that the measured dwell times are likely 164 underestimates as we did not consider events lasting longer than our imaging timeframe 165 of 500 sec . Nevertheless , these data indicate that MISP dissociation from filaments 166 containing ADP - actin is slow relative to other nucleotide states . To determine if MISP’s 167 association to filaments is also dependent on nucleotide composition , we monitored the 168 rate of increase in MISP fluorescence intensity during the decoration of immobilized actin 169 filaments . Exponential fitting of the resulting time courses revealed that the apparent 170 association rate is slightly lower for ADP - vs . ADP - Pi - and AMP - PNP - actin containing 171 filaments , by factors of ~ 1 . 1 and ~ 1 . 2 , respectively ( 0 . 30 µM - 1 s - 1 vs . 0 . 34 µM - 1 s - 1 vs . 0 . 36 172 µM - 1 s - 1 ) ( Figures S1C - E ) . Thus , MISP’s association kinetics are unlikely to contribute to 173 its preferential occupancy on ADP - actin enriched filaments . Together , these in vitro 174 findings suggest that an actin nucleotide state - sensing mechanism may contribute to 175 MISP’s specific enrichment on microvillar rootlets . 176 177 MISP preferentially binds near the pointed ends of actively growing actin filaments 178 We next sought to determine if MISP exhibits preferential binding near the pointed ends 179 of actively growing filaments , as we expect these sites to be enriched in ADP - actin after 180 several minutes of polymerization . 35 To this end , we designed TIRF assays with actively 181 growing filaments and observed polymerization for ~ 6 min prior to the addition of MISP , 182 which enabled identification of barbed and pointed ends based on differences in their 183 growth rates ( Figure 2A ) . After flowing in low concentrations of MISP , we observed puncta 184 7 preferentially binding with long dwell times ( > 70 s ) at or near the pointed ends ( Figure 185 2B - E ; Video S1 ) . In contrast , we observed fewer binding events near elongating barbed 186 ends , which are more likely to be enriched in ATP - or ADP - Pi - actin ( Figure 2E ) . 187 Interestingly , dwell times for MISP end - binding events were much longer than side - 188 binding events ( Figure 2F ) . To determine if this difference in event lifetime is based on 189 nucleotide state differences between these sites , we conducted experiments like those 190 described above ( Figures 1 and S1 ) by introducing low concentrations of MISP to 191 phalloidin - stabilized filaments containing only ADP - actin ( Figure S2A ) . Even under these 192 conditions , however , the number of MISP end - binding events was significantly higher 193 compared to side - binding events across multiple fields of view ( Figure S2B - C ) . 194 In cultured intestinal epithelial cells , MISP appears to be anchored to pre - existing 195 actin networks before core bundles assemble . 30 From this perspective , we sought to 196 determine if substrate bound MISP can capture the pointed ends of newly polymerizing 197 filaments from solution . To examine this possibility , we tethered MISP molecules on the 198 coverslip using anti - MISP antibodies and flowed in short seeds of actively polymerizing 199 actin filaments ( Figure 3A ) . Remarkably , immobilized MISP molecules maintained 200 preferential binding near the pointed ends , as indicated by the fast elongation of the 201 opposite barbed end over several minutes ( Figure 3B - C ; Video S2 ) . When binding events 202 were binned as pointed end , barbed end , or side - binding , we again found a preference 203 for pointed end binding ( Figure 3D ) . Together these data indicate that MISP exhibits a 204 strong preference for ADP - actin and for direct end binding , which likely work in 205 combination to constrain this factor at or near filament pointed ends . 206 207 MISP drives parallel and anti - parallel bundling of surface bound filaments 208 Considering that MISP normally functions as a crosslinker of multiple filaments , 30 , 36 we 209 next investigated whether MISP’s binding preference for ADP - actin and filament pointed 210 ends impacts its ability to organize multi - filament bundles . One intriguing possibility is that 211 MISP uses its ADP - actin binding ability to sequester the pointed ends of filaments , to in 212 turn create bundles of uniform polarity . To test this idea in vitro , we combined untethered , 213 polymerizing actin filaments with soluble MISP , and then observed the dynamics of 214 bundle formation over time using TIRF microscopy . Visualizing two - filament bundling 215 8 events , we found that MISP is capable of bundling filaments in parallel and antiparallel 216 fashion , with no significant preference for a single orientation ( Figure 4A - C ; Video S3 ) . 217 We also noted that MISP intensity was higher in two - filament bundles compared to single 218 filaments ( Figure 4B , D ) , suggesting a stronger affinity for two - filament arrays , likely 219 reflecting MISP’s multivalent actin binding potential . 36 A close inspection of two - filament 220 parallel bundling events also revealed that MISP signal was lower on newly polymerizing 221 pairs of filaments ( Figure 4B ; top row , green channel ) , as expected based on its 222 preference for binding older filaments that are enriched in ADP - actin ( Figure 1C ) . 223 224 MISP drives parallel alignment of multi - filament bundles in solution 225 During the course of collecting timelapse datasets in the experiments outlined above , we 226 also observed MISP - decorated actin bundles of four or more filaments ( based on 227 intensity ) landing in the field of view ( Figure S3A - C ; Video S4 , center panel ) . If MISP 228 exerts no influence over the orientation of individual polymers in multi - filament bundles , 229 one might expect to only observe anti - parallel bundles as the number of filaments in a 230 bundle increases ( Figure S3B ; top row ) . However , we observed thicker bundles that 231 landed and then elongated their barbed ends uniformly in one direction , implying parallel 232 alignment of constituent filaments ( Figure S3B ; bottom row ) . A close inspection across 233 multiple imaging fields revealed broom - shaped actin structures consisting of 20 or more 234 filaments and strong MISP signal at one end , which is consistent with parallel bundling 235 ( Figure S3C ) . Our failure to observe parallel bundling events de novo on the surface of 236 the coverslips ( Figure 4 ) is most likely due to the reduced conformational flexibility 237 imposed by substrate attachment . Together , these results suggest that MISP holds the 238 capacity to create anti - parallel and parallel bundles of multiple filaments . However , the 239 increased conformational degrees of freedom offered in solution may allow MISP to 240 sequester ADP - actin enriched pointed ends and promote parallel bundle formation . 241 242 DISCUSSION 243 MISP localization at microvillar rootlets is required for the normal elongation of this end 244 of the core bundle down into the sub - apical terminal web . 30 Confinement of MISP to core 245 bundle rootlets is partially explained by its exclusion from more distal segments by the 246 9 membrane - cytoskeleton crosslinking activity of ezrin . 30 The unique MISP actin binding 247 properties identified in this work represent additional , complementary mechanisms for 248 targeting MISP specifically to rootlets . Using in vitro reconstitution assays and direct 249 visualization with TIRF microscopy , we found that MISP dwell times on actin filaments 250 are significantly increased by the presence of ADP - actin relative to other nucleotide states 251 ( ADP - Pi and ATP - like AMP - PNP ) ( Figure 1 ) . MISP also demonstrated a clear preference 252 for binding near the pointed ends , even in filaments that were composed entirely of ADP - 253 actin . Here , we use the word “near” as the diffraction limited nature of TIRF microscopy 254 does not allow us to discriminate between true capping vs . binding in close proximity to 255 the pointed ends . Nevertheless , because core bundle rootlets are enriched in ADP - actin 256 ( Figure S1 ) and the pointed ends of constituent actin filaments , 11 these in vitro results 257 provide a mechanistic explanation for the direct targeting of MISP to core bundle rootlets . 258 259 Recent ultrastructural studies showed that ADP - actin containing filaments display a 260 flexibility that may expose multiple binding sites beyond those unmasked by phosphate 261 release alone , 24 , 37 and this may further permit the association of factors that appear to 262 “sense” nucleotide states , such as MISP . In terms of the molecular nature of the MISP - 263 actin interactions , the mechanism is likely unique as MISP shares little homology with 264 cofilin or other factors that demonstrate a preference for binding at or near the pointed 265 ends of actin filaments , including tropomodulins , 38 CAP , emerin , 39 and the bacterial 266 effector VopL / F . 40 Additional studies on the mechanism that allows MISP to sense ADP - 267 actin or bind near the pointed ends , will be needed to fill in these important mechanistic 268 details . 269 270 What functional benefit ( s ) would ADP - actin sensing and pointed end binding provide for 271 a filament bundling protein such as MISP ? Although it currently remains unclear how 272 MISP drives rootlet elongation , interestingly possibilities emerge considering the ADP - 273 actin sensing and pointed end binding activities revealed here . For example , MISP might 274 promote monomer association at the pointed ends , potentially by competing off capping 275 proteins such as tropomodulin - 3 . 41 , 42 The general idea that a bundling protein might 276 regulate the activity of an end binder is supported by recent in vitro biochemical studies 277 10 showing that espin exerts anti - capping effects at the barbed ends , which ultimately 278 contribute to filament and bundle elongation . 43 Alternatively , MISP could prevent 279 monomer dissociation from the pointed ends , potentially by delaying cofilin - driven 280 severing . The specific localization of MISP to core bundle rootlets might also drive a 281 downstream sorting mechanism that favors ( or restricts ) the binding of other actin 282 regulatory factors along the axis of the core bundle . 44 Previous studies found that different 283 bundling proteins self - segregate within the same actin networks , which may further 284 promote the sorting of other actin - binding factors by competition or by the differential 285 filament interspacing they create . 44 , 45 Sorting was also demonstrated in previous studies 286 with fimbrin , which displays preferential binding to MISP - bundled filaments , as well as the 287 basal half of the core bundle . 29 , 30 Although these roles are speculative , MISP is well 288 positioned to participate in these activities , alone or in combination , to promote rootlet 289 elongation . 290 291 Beyond regulating the length of core bundle rootlets at steady - state ( as alluded to above ) , 292 ADP - actin sensing and pointed end binding might also help MISP coordinate the 293 organization of actin filaments during core bundle assembly and microvillar growth . In the 294 case of filopodia , supporting core bundle filaments have their pointed ends crosslinked to 295 the sides of pre - existing filaments via the Arp2 / 3 complex , and this meshwork serves as 296 an anchoring platform for orienting filaments during protrusion growth . 46 Given that 297 microvilli assemble in an Arp2 / 3 - independent fashion , 47 , 48 it remains unclear how the 298 uniform polarity of core bundle filaments is established . Our bundling assays indicate that 299 MISP assembles substrate associated F - actin in both parallel and antiparallel bundles 300 ( Figure 4 ) , which is consistent with MISP localization to the unipolar core bundles of 301 microvilli and the mixed polarity bundles of stress fibers in cultured cells . 30 , 36 However , 302 the broom - shaped structures that we observed falling out of solution and landing on the 303 TIRF surface are suggestive of multi - filament bundles with uniform polarity ( Figure S3 ) . 304 Fimbrin assembles parallel bundles in vitro , 49 but its recruitment to microvillar rootlets 305 seems to be MISP - dependent . 30 Espin is another microvillar bundler capable of creating 306 bundles with uniform polarity in cells , 50 although its late accumulation during microvilli 307 differentiation is at odds with orchestrating bundle polarity . 31 Thus , as an early microvillar 308 11 factor with the ability to preferentially bind and crosslink filaments near their pointed ends , 309 MISP may be a candidate for establishing the polarity of core bundles early in microvillar 310 assembly . 311 312 Although the data we present here suggests that MISP might promote the uniform polarity 313 of filaments during bundle formation in vitro , in nascent epithelial cells this factor likely 314 coordinates with other actin binding and bundling factors that are known to be present 315 during the earliest stages of microvillar growth . One such factor is Epidermal Growth 316 Factor Receptor Pathway Substrate 8 ( EPS8 ) , a distal tip - specific microvillar protein that 317 also holds bundling potential in vitro . 51 – 53 Like MISP , EPS8 strongly localizes to the apical 318 region of immature enterocytes within intestinal crypts . 30 , 52 Given their end - specific 319 targeting and bundling functions , it is tempting to speculate that EPS8 and MISP 320 orchestrate the polarity of nascent core bundles from the barbed and pointed ends , 321 respectively . Assays that allow direct visualization of microvillar growth will be required to 322 determine whether these factors colocalize at the right place and time to organize 323 polymerizing filaments into parallel core actin bundles . 52 324 325 12 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 326 The authors would like to thank all members of the Tyska laboratory for their constructive 327 feedback .

Sections were washed and 467 incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C . Primary antibodies used were rabbit 468 anti - MISP ( Thermo Scientific ; PA5 - 61995 ) , or rabbit anti - Cofilin ( Sigma ; C8736 ) . Tissue 469 sections were then washed with 1X PBS and incubated with Alexa - Fluor - 568 Phalloidin 470 ( Invitrogen ; A12380 ) , Wheat German Agglutinin ( WGA ) 405M ( Biotium ; 29028 - 1 ) , and 471 F ( ab’ ) 2 - goat ant - rabbit IgG Alexa - Fluor - 488 ( Molecular probes ; A11070 ) for 2 h at room 472 temperature . Tissue sections were washed with 1X PBS and mounted in ProLong Gold 473 ( Invitrogen ; P36930 ) . 474 475 Light microscopy and image processing 476 Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) and Laser Scanning Confocal microscopy 477 imaging were conducted using the Nikon A1 Microscope equipped with 405 , 488 , 561 nm 478 LASERs , Apo TIRF 100x / 1 . 45 NA objective , and an Evolve EMCCD camera for the TIRF 479 modality ( Photometrics Technology ) . Images were denoised using Nikon Elements 480 software for images shown in Figures 2 , 3 , S2 and S4 . During imaging acquisition , the 481 gain was matched between samples for comparison . 482 483 MISP cloning and protein purification 484 The full length human MISP sequence was originally obtained from Harvard PlasmID 485 Database ( HsCD00326629 ) . MISP was then shuttled into Gateway - adapted plasmid 486 pEGFP - C1 . To create baculovirus expression vectors , EGFP - MISP sequence was 487 subcloned into modified pFastBac - 6xHis - MBP LIC expression vector ( Addgene ; plasmid 488 # 30116 ) . In - frame sequence insertion was confirmed by sequencing . The 6xHis - MBP - 489 EGFP - MISP construct was expressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells as previously 490 described . 30 Briefly , insect cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris HCl , 491 0 . 3 M KCl , 10 mM imidazole , 10 % glycerol , 2 mM DTT , pH 7 . 5 ) supplemented with 492 protease inhibitors ( Roche , 5892953001 ) . The resultant lysate was then centrifuged at 493 35 , 000 rpm in a Ti 50 . 2 rotor ( Beckman ) for 30 minutes at 4 °C . Samples were loaded 494 18 into a HisTrap column according to the manufacturer protocol and eluted with a 50 - 500 495 mM linear imidazole gradient ( pH 7 . 5 ) . Protein purity was assessed by SDS - PAGE . 496 Eluted protein was concentrated using a centrifugal filter ( Millipore ; UFC803024 ) in 497 storage buffer ( 20 mM Tris HCl , 0 . 1 M KCl , 10 mM imidazole , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM EGTA , 498 2 mM DTT , pH 7 . 5 ) . 499 500 In vitro reconstitutions assays 501 Coverslip functionalization . Coverslips ( Thorlabs , CG15KH ) were placed into a glass 502 jar , bathed in acetone for 30 minutes , incubated in ethanol for 15 minutes , and washed in 503 MiliQ water three times . Subsequently , the coverslips were sonicated in 2 % Hellmanex 504 or 2 % Micro90 for 2 hours at room temperature in a water bath sonicator , followed by 505 series of washes in MiliQ water . Coverslips were then transferred into a 0 . 1 M KOH bath , 506 incubated for 30 minutes , washed in MiliQ water and dried with clean nitrogen gas . For 507 functionalization , coverslips were submerged in a glass jar containing mPEG - Silane 508 ( Laysan Bio Inc , MPEG - SIL - 5000 ) or Biotin - mPEG - Silane ( Laysan Bio inc , Biotin - PEG - 509 SIL - 5K ) solution , and protected from light for 18 hours . The next day , coverslips were 510 washed with clean ethanol and MiliQ water . Finally , coverslips were dried once again with 511 clean nitrogen gas and stored at 4 ° C for up to two weeks . 512 513 TIRF flow channel preparation . Strips of double - sided tape were placed along the 514 length of the functionalized side of a coverslip leaving a gap of approximately 2 - 3 mm 515 between each strip . Flow channels were made by placing the coverslip / tape strips on a 516 clean glass slide . The flow channels were subsequently sealed by gently pressing the 517 areas with tape in between glass sides , and stored at 4 ° C . Before each experiment , the 518 flow channels were washed with high salt ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 600 mM KCl , 1 % BSA ) 519 and low salt ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM KCl , 1 % BSA ) buffers , blocked with 1X 520 TBSA ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 1 % BSA ) for 5 minutes , and coated with 0 . 1 521 – 1 μg / ml streptavidin ( SIGMA , 189730 ) for 5 minutes . 522 523 Actin preparation . Rhodamine - actin ( Cytoskeleton , AR05 ) , biotin - actin ( Cytoskeleton , 524 AB07 ) , and black actin ( Cytoskeleton , AKL99 ) were resuspended in G - actin buffer ( 5 mM 525 19 Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ; 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) supplemented with 0 . 2 mM ATP ( SIGMA , 10519979001 ) 526 and mixed at a final ratio of 20 : 1 : 79 , respectively . Alternatively , G - buffer was 527 supplemented with 0 . 2 mM AMP - PNP ( SIGMA , A2647 ) to prepare non - hydrolysable ATP - 528 bound filaments . Subsequently , the resulting G - actin mix was ultracentrifuged at 90K rpm 529 for 30 minutes at 4 ° C in an ultracentrifuge ( Beckman , Optima TL 100 ) to remove actin 530 oligomers and / or aggregates . 531 532 MISP binding on immobilized F - actin . G - actin was mixed with TIRF polymerization 533 buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM DTT , 0 . 2 534 mM ATP , 15 mM Glucose , 0 . 5 % Methylcellulose , 1X Oxyrase , 0 . 1 % BSA ) , and flowed in 535 through a streptavidin - coated flow channel at a final concentration of 500 nM . At this 536 concentration , actin is expected to polymerize exclusively from the barbed ends while the 537 pointed ends depolymerize very slowly . Once the polarity of filaments was determined as 538 evidenced by the exclusive and rapid elongation from barbed ends , EGFP - MISP 539 molecules were flowed in at a final concentration of 12 . 5 nM , and its binding position 540 relative to the filament was monitored over time . 541 542 MISP - driven anchoring of F - actin . Biotin - anti - 6xHis antibodies ( SIGMA , MA1 - 21315 - 543 BTIN ) were flowed in through a streptavidin - coated flow channel . Subsequently , EGFP - 544 MISP molecules ( harboring a 6xHis tag at the N - terminus ) were flowed in at a final 545 concentration of 12 . 5 nM , incubated for 5 minutes to allow for their immobilization . To 546 monitor short filament capturing events , G - actin ( 500 nM ) was mixed with TIRF 547 polymerization buffer and polymerize for approximately 5 minutes before flowing in the 548 reaction through the MISP - immobilized flow channel . 549 550 ADP , ADP - Pi , and ATP - like filament preparation 551 F - Actin was generated as described earlier but was stabilized with unlabeled phalloidin 552 ( ThermoFisher , P3457 ) to allow for dilution below the critical concentration ( < 100 nM ) . 553 Phalloidin was also added at different time points of polymerization to generate F - actin in 554 the ADP and ADP - Pi state as previously described . 34 To note , phalloidin was included in 555 20 all buffers throughout these assays to maintain the nucleotide state of filaments , 556 especially in the case of the ADP - Pi condition . 557 558 ADP F - actin phalloidin stabilized . Rhodamine - biotin G - actin ( 1 µM ) was polymerized at 559 room temperature , and phalloidin ( 2 µM ) was added at a 2 : 1 molar ratio . F - actin was 560 further aged for 24 hours before conducting assays . 561 562 ADP - Pi F - actin phalloidin stabilized . Rhodamine - biotin G - actin ( 1 µM ) was polymerized 563 at room temperature in the presence of phalloidin ( 2 µM ) at a 2 : 1 molar ratio , and used 564 within the next 24 hours of preparation . 565 566 AMP - PNP F - actin phalloidin stabilized . Rhodamine - biotin G - actin ( 1 µM ) was 567 polymerized at room temperature in the presence of the nucleotide analog AMP - PNP ( 0 . 2 568 mM ) and phalloidin ( 2 µM ) at a 2 : 1 molar ratio , and used within the next 48 hours of 569 preparation . 570 571 In all experiments , all different versions of actin filaments were flowed in into the TIRF 572 channel , washed with TIRF buffer . Subsequently , EGFP - MISP in TIRF buffer was flowed 573 in into the TIRF channel as imaging was in progress to determine dwell times . 574 575 Actin bundling polarity assays 576 G - actin ( 500 nM ) was mixed with EGFP - MISP ( 50nM ) in TIRF polymerization buffer , and 577 flowed in into an uncoated flow channel . To simplify quantification , two - filament bundling 578 events were considered . 579 580 Quantification and statistical analysis 581 All images were quantified and analyzed using the FIJI software package . Image 582 registration from TIRF microscopy movies was performed using the StackReg plugin to 583 correct for XY drifts when needed . 584 585 MISP dwell time on phalloidin - stabilized F - actin 586 21 Line scans were drawn along movies of actin filaments longer than 2 µm and converted 587 into kymographs . From these kymographs , the dwell time of multiple MISP binding events 588 along the filament were measured and plotted in a histogram . Only finite MISP dwell times 589 were considered for fitting purposes . 590 591 MISP binding on polymerizing F - actin 592 The distribution of MISP binding events on filaments were calculated as follows : A single 593 MISP binding event was considered positive if it remained stably bound to a single actin 594 filament longer than 8 frames ( i . e . , 70 seconds ) . A line scan was drawn along the 595 corresponding filament in the first frame of MISP binding to determine the filament length . 596 The maximum MISP peak intensity was used as a reference point to determine its 597 “distance from the pointed ends” . 598 599 MISP apparent association rates 600 Rectangular ROIs ( 2 x 1 . 2 µm ) were drawn along immobilized filaments ( 50 nM ) , which 601 were used to measure EGFP - MISP ( 50 nM ) fluorescence intensity over time . Intensity 602 values were plotted and fitted with an exponential curve to estimate the apparent 603 association rates . 604 605 MISP - driven anchoring of single actin filaments 606 Anchoring events refer to events where a single polymerizing filament was immobilized 607 by a single MISP puncta . A “pointed end anchoring event” was considered positive when 608 the captured filament kept polymerizing from the opposite free end . A “barbed end 609 anchoring event” was considered positive when the filament kept polymerizing from the 610 captured end . Events that did not meet these criteria were considered as “side capturing 611 events” . 612 613 MISP - driven bundling of two actin filaments 614 We manually quantified the number of MISP - driven bundling events of two filaments by 615 observing the direction of their growth before or after they overlapped . If filaments were 616 already overlapping , their direction of growth was evident by the increase in the intensity 617 22 of two filaments compared to one filament . To quantify the intensity of EGFP - MISP , we 618 drew 0 . 5 µm x 2 - pixel lines scans along 1 - and 2 - filaments at multiple time points . Values 619 were then arbitrarily normalized to generate the plot . 620 621 Statistical analysis 622 All statistical analysis was computed in PRISM v . 9 . 0 ( GraphPad ) 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 23 REFERENCES 650 651 1 .
