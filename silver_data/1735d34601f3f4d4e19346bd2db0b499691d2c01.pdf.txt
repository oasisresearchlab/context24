ABSTRACT Introduction Infectious disease misinformation is widespread and poses challenges to disease control . There is limited evidence on how to effectively counter health misinformation in a community setting , particularly in low - income regions , and unsettled scientific debate about whether misinformation should be directly discussed and debunked , or implicitly countered by providing scientifically correct information . Methods The Contagious Misinformation Trial developed and tested interventions designed to counter highly prevalent infectious disease misinformation in Sierra Leone , namely the beliefs that ( 1 ) mosquitoes cause typhoid and ( 2 ) typhoid co - occurs with malaria . The information intervention for group A ( n = 246 ) explicitly discussed misinformation and explained why it was incorrect and then provided the scientifically correct information . The intervention for group B ( n = 245 ) only focused on providing correct information , without directly discussing related misinformation . Both interventions were delivered via audio dramas on WhatsApp that incorporated local cultural understandings of typhoid . Participants were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 to the intervention groups or the control group ( n = 245 ) , who received two episodes about breast feeding . Results At baseline 51 % believed that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes and 59 % believed that typhoid and malaria always co - occur . The endline survey was completed by 91 % of participants . Results from the intention - to - treat , per - protocol and as - treated analyses show that both interventions substantially reduced belief in misinformation compared with the control group . Estimates from these analyses , as well as an exploratory dose – response analysis , suggest that direct debunking may be more effective at countering misinformation . Both interventions improved people’s knowledge and self - reported behaviour around typhoid risk reduction , and yielded self - reported increases in an important preventive method , drinking treated water . Conclusion These results from a field experiment in a community setting show that highly prevalent health misinformation can be countered , and that direct , detailed debunking may be most effective . Trial registration number NCT04112680 . INTRODUCTION Misinformation can be as contagious as a virus—sometimes more . And like a virus , misinformation can be fatal . There is strong evidence that misinformation can reduce protective actions , encourage risky behaviours Key questions What is already known ? ► Health - related misinformation is highly prevalent and highly damaging . ► Randomised trials to counter real - world misinforma - tion remain rare , with most evidence to date being limited to high - income settings . What are the new findings ? ► Two narrative audio dramas were tested via WhatsApp in Freetown , Sierra Leone ; the first explic - itly mentioned and debunked typhoid - related mis - information , the second focused only on providing scientifically correct information . ► Both interventions effectively reduced belief in mis - information as well as improved knowledge and self - reported protective behaviours , but stronger ef - fects were achieved by explicitly citing and debunk - ing misinformation . What do the new findings imply ? ► Explicitly addressing why misinformation is wrong via narrative public health messaging may prove ef - fective in countering infodemics . 2 Winters M , et al . BMJ Global Health 2021 ; 6 : e006954 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjgh - 2021 - 006954 BMJ Global Health and promote the spread of infectious disease . 1 2 The WHO has described the current COVID - 19 pandemic as an ‘infodemic’ , pointing to the overabundance of ( mis ) information . 3 4 Widespread misinformation has posed significant challenges to the control of the pandemic , introducing ( and amplifying ) uncertainty about the importance and efficacy of non - pharmaceutical inter - ventions such as masking and social distancing , as well as safety and efficacy of vaccines for SARS - CoV - 2 . 2 3 5 The public health challenges posed by misinformation go far beyond COVID - 19 . Vaccine hesitancy , driven by online misinformation , has played a role in the recurrence of preventable diseases , notably measles . 6 – 8 The rapid rise in the use of social media has increased the volume and velocity of misinformation , giving the especially virulent narratives a wider reach . 9 10 Despite the urgent need for tools to counter health - related misin - formation , there is limited evidence on which strategies are efficacious . Meta - analyses studying different strate - gies for countering misinformation found that detailed counterarguments could be effective , especially when they are delivered by a trusted source and in line with recipients’ worldviews and social norms . 11 12 However , this approach does not always yield reductions in belief in misinformation . 11 12 This might be explained by the continued influence effect , whereby despite credible alternatives , people still rely on the initial misinforma - tion , 13 – 17 or via a number of cognitive biases through which repeated exposure to information can strengthen its cognitive availability or appeal , raising the risk that corrective messaging inadvertently strengthens belief in misinformation . 18 – 20 Fortunately , evidence thus far shows that these types of unwanted side effects of debunking do not always occur . 21 22 However , many studies have methodological limitations and few use a pre - post randomised controlled design . 21 An alterna - tive approach to debunking misinformation emphasises providing correct information rather than directly coun - tering misinformation , to avoid spreading the narrative further to people who would otherwise not have come in contact with it and thus increasing their familiarity with the misinformation . 23 – 27 To date , there have been very few experimental studies of interventions to reduce misinformation in non - laboratory settings . 13 15 28 Most studies aiming to test debunking strategies against health and non - health - related misinformation have been carried out using survey experiments , or in laboratory experiments on university campuses , with relatively small sample sizes and subjects including young , mostly female college students . 11 29 Furthermore , many studies have not been anchored in a real - world context , as the effectiveness of debunking strategies was evaluated by experimentally introducing a piece of misinformation and subsequently countering its content . 23 30 In summary , there is limited evidence to date to counter already existing misinfor - mation that is prevalent among the public . In addition , as most studies have been carried out in high - income settings , little is known about debunking strategies in low - income settings that are especially vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks . Studies that have been performed in low - income settings have mainly looked at various forms of health education to increase knowl - edge and uptake of protective behaviours , as opposed to specifically testing debunking strategies to target health misinformation . 31 – 34 In Sierra Leone , there is widespread misinforma - tion regarding typhoid , and in particular , widespread belief that typhoid and malaria are closely related . 35 Interestingly , people commonly conceptualise typhoid and malaria as a single disease , ‘typhoid - malaria’ . The belief structure linking these diseases is complex and varied . Some narratives indicate that malaria weakens the immune system , which in turn leads to typhoid infection ; another narrative suggests that ‘typhoid and malaria walk on the same road’ or ‘are friends’ , which implies that the diseases have some causal relationship . Finally , some conceptualise typhoid - malaria as a more severe case of malaria , requiring distinct treatment approaches . The notion that typhoid and malaria occur in conjunction is the common denominator across all explanations . The perceived similarity of the two diseases also makes many people believe that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes . Although typhoid and malaria share symptoms ( eg , fever ) , they are very different diseases : typhoid is caused by bacterial infection , usually transmitted through contaminated food , water and the faecal - oral route . The incidence of typhoid in Sierra Leone is estimated to be low ( around 15 000 cases in 2019 ) . 36 Malaria is a disease spread by parasite - infected mosquitoes and is much more common than typhoid in Sierra Leone , with more than 3 . 7 million cases estimated in 2019 . 36 Typhoid can be diagnosed through blood culture . However , in Sierra Leone only one hospital currently has the necessary equipment , and resource constraints limit the availability of blood culture for clinical diagnosis . 37 Instead , the Widal test is commonly used to diagnose typhoid . The Widal test reportedly has low sensitivity , specificity and positive predictive value for typhoid diag - nosis , 38 39 and may cross - react with malaria antigens , raising the risk of a false - positive result for patients with malaria infections . 40 Confirmed coinfection of malaria and typhoid is rarely observed . 41 – 43 However , in Sierra Leone patients are frequently diagnosed in health centres with ‘typhoid - malaria’ , often without using a diagnostic test , 44 which in addition to antimalarials often is treated with antibiotics . 45 While there are limited data on typhoid diagnosis and related antibiotic usage in Sierra Leone , 44 the overdiagnosis of typhoid has likely contributed to the unnecessary use of antibiotics , as well as ensuing antibi - otic resistance . 46 47 Countering typhoid misinformation could therefore inform and empower citizens to question a typhoid - malaria diagnosis and potentially avoid unnec - essary usage of antibiotics . Winters M , et al . BMJ Global Health 2021 ; 6 : e006954 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjgh - 2021 - 006954 3 BMJ Global Health METHODS The Contagious Misinformation Trial ( CMT ) was a prospective , three - arm , superiority randomised controlled trial that took place within the community in Freetown , the capital of Sierra Leone , in 2019 . The CMT investigated the efficacy of two debunking strate - gies to counter misinformation about typhoid in Free - town , Sierra Leone , by incorporating scientific and risk communication information into four - episode audio dramas ( see table 1 ) delivered via WhatsApp , a widely used instant messaging platform . The audio dramas targeting intervention group A ( the Plausible Alternative group ) explicitly mentioned the misinformation and provided a detailed counter - argument . The audio dramas applied to intervention group B ( the Avoiding Misinformation group ) did not directly discuss the misinformation , and instead only focused on providing scientifically correct information . The control group received audio messages on breast feeding , unrelated to typhoid - malaria . We tested the efficacy of the two interventions using a randomised controlled trial of 736 participants that took place in the community . Comparing the two interventions allows us to examine whether explicitly invoking and discussing misinformation yields superior results in terms of reducing belief in misinformation . We tested two main outcomes : ► The belief that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes . ► The belief that typhoid can only co - occur with malaria . The study was designed to detect a relative reduction of 15 % in belief in misinformation between one of the intervention groups and the control group . Based on pilot testing , we assumed a 50 % prevalence of belief in misinformation . A sample size of 170 per group was required to provide power of 0 . 80 for a one - sided Wald test . Because of the clustered sampling strategy , the intracluster correlation ( ICC ) can potentially reduce the effective sample size compared with the calculated sample size . Based on a previous study , we assumed an ICC of 0 . 01 48 and a design effect of 1 . 2 . 49 The sample size was expanded to 250 per group in order to address ICC and potential attrition . The postattrition sample size of 668 gives a statistical power of approximately 0 . 97 . 50 Recruitment of participants We selected 21 of the 64 administrative sections in Free - town as trial sites using weighted random sampling without replacement . As these sections vary widely in size ( between roughly 600 and 6000 households ) , each section had a weighted probability of selection propor - tionate to its size . The weighted random selection was done by a macro written in Visual Basic for Application for Microsoft Excel . During the recruitment phase , three teams consisting of four enumerators and one supervisor visited one section per day for 7 days ( 7 – 13 October 2019 ) . Each enumerator recruited nine new participants in each section . Eligible participants were adults ( 18 years and older ) , living in Freetown , fluent in Krio , in possession of a phone with WhatsApp and with no hearing impair - ments ( more details about the recruitment can be found in the online supplemental material ) . Participants received 10 . 000 leones ( about US $ 1 ) worth of data credit ( around 220 MB ) per audio message they received , to ensure that the audio messages could be downloaded . All enumerators and supervisors followed the 3 - day training both before the recruitment and base - line survey and before the endline survey was conducted . The aim of the training was for the enumerators to understand the purpose of the study , the recruitment , and to practise the translation of the survey to Krio . The survey was constructed and pilot tested in English , and translated both in written and spoken Krio by a certified translator in Freetown . The data collection for the endline survey was struc - tured in a similar fashion as the baseline survey , with each team of four enumerators and one supervisor visiting one section per day . Enumerators called participants at least 1 day in advance to make appointments . Five extra data collection days were used to visit participants that could not be reached directly ( 2 – 13 December 2019 ) . In Western Area Urban ( the district in which Freetown is situated ) , an estimated 65 % of the population has access to the internet , compared with around 38 % elsewhere in the country . 51 This means that the sample in our study is likely wealthier and more highly educated than the general population in Sierra Leone . To strengthen the external validity and understand whether the interven - tion would work with another mode of administration , we Table 1 Core messages of audio dramas by intervention group Episode Group A : Plausible Alternative Group B : Avoiding Misinformation 1 .

Repetition of core messages in episodes 1 – 3 . 4 Winters M , et al . BMJ Global Health 2021 ; 6 : e006954 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjgh - 2021 - 006954 BMJ Global Health conducted an ancillary analysis with 60 additional partici - pants who did not have WhatsApp but were in possession of a mobile phone ( see online supplemental file 2 ) . Data collection teams were instructed not to say words like ‘misinformation’ when recruiting participants . Instead , they would explain that the study would aim to understand people’s knowledge about diseases , as knowl - edge is power . The Krio name for the study was ‘Info Na Pawa’ , or ‘Information is power’ . After obtaining written informed consent , the baseline survey was administered in Krio . Randomisation and masking After the recruitment and baseline survey , the partic - ipants were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 across two intervention groups ( A ( n = 246 ) and B ( n = 245 ) ) and one control group ( n = 245 ) . The random allocation sequence was generated by an Excel Macro ( created by ZZ ) , in which the whole sample was treated as one block . After randomisation , the study team and the partici - pants were blinded to the allocation of the participants . Enumerators were not aware of participants’ interven - tion condition during the endline survey . Questions about the audio messages ( which would have potentially revealed whether the participant was in the intervention or control group ) were asked at the end of the survey , so that enumerators would not be biased . After completion of the endline survey , data were anonymised so that the analysis team was blinded to the allocation of the partic - ipants as well . Intervention The two intervention groups in the CMT received audio messages that were based on evidence around coun - tering misinformation . The first intervention ( group A ) was called ‘Plausible Alternative’ , and was informed by research showing that offering a plausible alternative to the misinformation has a higher success rate than simply rejecting the misinformation as false . 11 The second inter - vention ( group B ) was called ‘Avoiding Misinformation’ , and was motivated by a less explored debunking method , which is to provide correct information without invoking or mentioning misinformation to limit the risk of further spreading misinformation . 23 We drew on these theories to produce two sets of audio dramas , with four episodes each . The audio dramas were produced in Krio with the Free - tong Players , a well - known actors group in Sierra Leone . The episodes in the Plausible Alternative drama explic - itly cited and discussed misinformation around typhoid and malaria , which was subsequently debunked in the episodes . The episodes in the Avoiding Misinformation drama on the other hand did not mention the misinfor - mation at all and instead focused on the correct informa - tion regarding typhoid . The audio dramas incorporated local cultural understandings and language regarding typhoid and malaria . The Freetong Players identified themselves at the start of each episode , and the scientific and risk communication messaging in the dramas was delivered by credible characters : physicians and nurses . By sending out four episodes in each intervention group , we ensured repeated exposure to debunking efforts . 23 24 Every episode had one core message ( see table 1 ) and lasted between 2 and 5 min . ( See the English transcripts in the online supplemental information . To listen to the dramas ( in Krio ) and access the full dataset see : https : / / data . mendeley . com / datasets / c758p4dtwz / 3 52 ) . Participants in the control group received two episodes promoting breast feeding in Krio , which were approxi - mately 1 min long . Outcomes The two main outcomes ( ie , to reduce the belief that ( 1 ) typhoid is caused by mosquitoes and ( 2 ) can only co - occur with malaria ) were captured in the baseline and endline survey with yes / no questions and were analysed with intention - to - treat ( ITT ) and per - protocol anal - yses . We conducted a dose – response analysis for each primary outcome . As a robustness check we conducted an as - treated analysis of the two primary outcomes . The study included several secondary outcomes . First , whether either the intervention unintentionally seeded misinformation among participants who held the correct beliefs as baseline . Second , we tested whether the inter - ventions improved knowledge about preventive methods and self - reported practices for typhoid . Statistical analysis Demographic descriptive statistics were tabulated and differences between the intervention and control groups analysed using χ 2 tests . We carried out an ITT analysis , excluding the participants who were lost to follow - up . The per - protocol analyses only included participants who reported listening to 100 % of the episodes ( four episodes for the intervention groups , two episodes for the control group ) . We also conducted sensitivity analyses to ensure that the per - protocol estimates were not confounded by sample selection ( see online supplemental material ) . For the as - treated analysis , the groups were determined based on the endline survey question ‘ Was the audio about typhoid or about breastfeeding ? ’ Crude logistic regression models were specified for the ITT , per - protocol and as - treated analyses . Adjusted logistic regression models incorporated sociodemo - graphic covariates , including sex , education , religion , monthly income and age . As a robustness check , we also estimated Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) regression models with robust SEs for the ITT , per - protocol and as - treated analyses ; the results were consistent with the analyses presented in the main text and can be found in the online supplemental information . We applied a Bonferroni adjustment to account for multiple hypoth - esis tests , setting our alpha at 0 . 025 . We tested whether the interventions unintentionally seeded misinformation by limiting the analysis to respon - dents who held scientifically correct beliefs at baseline , Winters M , et al . BMJ Global Health 2021 ; 6 : e006954 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjgh - 2021 - 006954 5 BMJ Global Health and modelling whether the treatments lead to an increase in belief in misinformation at endline . We used logistic regression models , comparing the intervention groups to each other , as well as to the control group . We conducted an exploratory dose – response analysis by building a treatment index based on the number of episodes each respondent reported listened to ; indexing these values allows us to compare the dose – response rela - tionship for the intervention groups ( who listened to a maximum of four episodes ) to the control group ( who listened to a maximum of two episodes ) . We conducted this analysis for the two primary outcomes using crude and covariate - adjusted logistic regression models . Knowledge about preventive methods was assessed through an index constructed from an open - ended ques - tion on preventive methods that was administered in both the baseline and endline survey ( ‘ Can you name up to 3 ways how you can prevent yourself from getting typhoid ? ’ ) . Correct answers such as drinking treated water were awarded one point , incorrect answers such as taking anti - malarials received one minus point ( see online supple - mental material ) . The total score per participant varied between −3 and + 3 . The difference between the interven - tion groups and the control group in preventive knowl - edge was analysed through crude and adjusted ordinal logistic regression models . Lastly , we conducted an exploratory analysis of two behavioural outcomes to estimate whether the inter - vention increased the use of scientifically grounded approaches to reduce the risk of typhoid infection . In the baseline survey , participants were asked whether they currently take actions to avoid getting infected by typhoid . Those answering yes were asked about the type of actions taken through an open - ended question . Similarly , in the endline survey , participants were asked whether they had taken actions in the last 2 months ( ie , the time between the baseline and endline survey ) to avoid a typhoid infec - tion . Those answering yes received the open - ended ques - tion regarding the specific actions they had taken . Crude and adjusted logistic regression models were fitted for two behavioural outcomes : sleeping under a bednet and drinking treated water ( with only the latter a scientifically correct approach to reduce typhoid risk ) . It should be noted that episode 3 in intervention group A mentioned that while sleeping under a bednet does not prevent a typhoid infection , it does help prevent malaria ; we therefore expect intervention group A to be less likely to report sleeping under a bednet to prevent typhoid at endline ( though no less likely to use a bednet to avoid malaria infection ) . Stata MP V . 15 was used for the analysis . The online supplemental tables S10 – S15 describe sensitivity analyses . The full study protocol and statistical analysis plan can be accessed at ClinicalTrials . gov and the online supple - mental file 2 . The study was reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials . 53 RESULTS In total , 736 participants in Freetown were enrolled in the CMT . A total of 44 ( 6 % ) participants were lost during the intervention period and 24 ( 3 % ) participants could not be recontacted for endline data collection , yielding a completion rate of 91 % ( see figure 1 ) . Participants who had completed primary education had a slightly higher attrition rate than those who had Figure 1 Flow chart of the Contagious Misinformation Trial . 6 Winters M , et al . BMJ Global Health 2021 ; 6 : e006954 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjgh - 2021 - 006954 BMJ Global Health no formal education , as well as those who had completed secondary and postsecondary education ( see online supplemental table S1 ) . The majority of the participants had received secondary education ( 54 % ) ( see table 2 ) . Islam was the most common religion among the partic - ipants ( 60 % ) . Two - thirds of the participants earned up to US $ 30 ( 300 . 000 leones ) per month . Almost two - thirds of the participants ( 66 % ) indicated that they had had typhoid at some point in life . In total , 94 % of study participants reported in the baseline survey that they had heard of typhoid - malaria . Belief in misinformation was highly prevalent : at baseline , 51 % believed that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes , and 59 % believed that typhoid and malaria co - occur ( see table 2 , online supplemental table S2 ) . There was no statistical difference between the three randomised groups on the demographic variables . At baseline , there was also no statistical difference in belief in misinformation between the intervention and control groups . ITT analysis The belief that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes was signif - icantly reduced in intervention group A compared with the control group in the ITT analysis ( group A : adjusted OR ( AOR ) 0 . 29 , 95 % CI 0 . 18 to 0 . 47 , see table 3 and online supplemental figure S1 ) . In intervention group B , the reduction was not significant ( AOR 0 . 61 , 95 % CI 0 . 39 to 0 . 95 , p = 0 . 029 ) .

The belief that typhoid co - occurs with malaria was significantly reduced in both intervention groups in the ITT analysis ( group A : AOR 0 . 29 , 95 % CI 0 . 19 to 0 . 45 ; group B : AOR 0 . 55 , 95 % CI 0 . 36 to 0 . 83 ) ( table 3 and online supplemental figure S2 ) . Group A showed a greater reduction than group B in the adjusted model ( AOR 0 . 51 , 95 % CI 0 . 33 to 0 . 81 , see table 4 ) , but was not significant in the crude model ( AOR 0 . 65 , 95 % CI 0 . 43 to 0 . 98 ) . As a robustness check , we ran the ITT analysis using OLS regression , which yielded similar results ( see online supplemental table S3 ) . Per - protocol analysis Similarly , both intervention groups had reduced levels of belief in misinformation under the per - protocol analyses ( see tables 3 and 4 , online supplemental figures S1 and S2 and online supplemental table S3 for OLS models ) . The belief that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes was lower in both intervention groups compared with the control group ( group A : AOR 0 . 06 , 95 % CI 0 . 02 to 0 . 20 ; group B : AOR 0 . 35 , 95 % CI 0 . 15 to 0 . 84 ) ; group A showed sharper declines in the odds than group B ( AOR 0 . 15 , 95 % CI 0 . 04 to 0 . 58 ) . Similarly , the belief that typhoid and malaria co - occur was reduced at endline in the inter - vention groups compared with the control group ( group Table 3 Primary outcomes for intervention group A and group B versus control group Crude OR ( 95 % CI ) P value Adjusted * OR ( 95 % CI ) P value Typhoid comes from mosquitoes Intention - to - treat ( n = 583 ) † Group A 0 . 31 ( 0 . 20 to 0 . 48 ) 0 . 000 0 . 29 ( 0 . 18 to 0 . 47 ) 0 . 000 Group B 0 . 50 ( 0 . 33 to 0 . 77 ) 0 . 002 0 . 61 ( 0 . 39 to 0 . 95 ) 0 . 029 Control Reference – Reference – Per - protocol ( n = 210 ) Group A 0 . 07 ( 0 . 02 to 0 . 19 ) 0 . 000 0 . 06 ( 0 . 02 to 0 . 20 ) 0 . 000 Group B 0 . 31 ( 0 . 14 to 0 . 70 ) 0 . 005 0 . 35 ( 0 . 15 to 0 . 84 ) 0 . 019 Control Reference – Reference – As - treated ( n = 419 ) Group A 0 . 15 ( 0 . 08 to 0 . 27 ) 0 . 000 0 . 13 ( 0 . 07 to 0 . 25 ) 0 . 000 Group B 0 . 33 ( 0 . 19 to 0 . 57 ) 0 . 000 0 . 38 ( 0 . 21 to 0 . 68 ) 0 . 001 Control Reference – Reference – Typhoid and malaria co - occur Intention - to - treat ( n = 618 ) † Group A 0 . 32 ( 0 . 21 to 0 . 48 ) 0 . 000 0 . 29 ( 0 . 19 to 0 . 45 ) 0 . 000 Group B 0 . 49 ( 0 . 33 to 0 . 73 ) 0 . 000 0 . 55 ( 0 . 36 to 0 . 83 ) 0 . 004 Control Reference – Reference – Per - protocol ( n = 220 ) Group A 0 . 07 ( 0 . 03 to 0 . 18 ) 0 . 000 0 . 06 ( 0 . 02 to 0 . 15 ) 0 . 000 Group B 0 . 16 ( 0 . 07 to 0 . 36 ) 0 . 000 0 . 15 ( 0 . 06 to 0 . 36 ) 0 . 000 Control Reference – Reference – As - treated ( n = 434 ) Group A 0 . 13 ( 0 . 08 to 0 . 23 ) 0 . 000 0 . 12 ( 0 . 07 to 0 . 21 ) 0 . 000 Group B 0 . 25 ( 0 . 15 to 0 . 42 ) 0 . 000 0 . 27 ( 0 . 16 to 0 . 47 ) 0 . 000 Control Reference – Reference – * Adjusted for sex , education , religion , income and age . †Complete case analysis .

There was no statistical difference between group A and group B ( AOR 0 . 32 , 95 % CI 0 . 09 to 1 . 09 ) . As - treated analysis For the as - treated analysis , 30 participants ( 13 % ) were reclassified from control to intervention group A , and 10 participants ( 3 ( 1 % ) in group A and 7 ( 3 % ) in group B ) from intervention to control . Results are robust to different reclassification techniques ( see online supple - mental table S4 ) . The as - treated analysis confirmed that participants in both intervention groups were signifi - cantly less likely to believe in misinformation . The belief that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes had significantly lower odds in both groups compared with the control group ( group A : AOR 0 . 13 , 95 % CI 0 . 07 to 0 . 25 ; group B : AOR 0 . 38 , 95 % CI 0 . 21 to 0 . 68 ) .

Seeding misinformation It is possible that an informational intervention to miti - gate misinformation can instead have the undesired effect of ‘seeding’ it , for example , by exposing people who previously held scientifically correct beliefs to factu - ally incorrect beliefs , which then take hold . We analysed whether the intervention unintentionally seeded misin - formation among the participants who held the correct beliefs at baseline . Participants in group A were less likely to believe the misinformation at endline compared with the control group , for both the belief that mosquitoes cause typhoid ( AOR 0 . 35 , 95 % CI 0 . 15 to 0 . 81 ) and the belief that typhoid and malaria co - occur ( AOR 0 . 39 , 95 % CI 0 . 18 to 0 . 82 ) ( see online supplemental table S5 ) . There was no significant difference between group B and the control group for the mosquito belief ( AOR 0 . 70 , 95 % CI 0 . 33 to 1 . 51 ) and the belief that typhoid and malaria co - occur ( AOR 0 . 58 , 95 % CI 0 . 29 to 1 . 16 ) .

BMJ Global Health 2021 ; 6 : e006954 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjgh - 2021 - 006954 9 BMJ Global Health was no difference between group A and group B on both outcomes ( mosquito outcome : AOR 0 . 41 , 95 % CI 0 . 15 to 1 . 05 ; malaria co - occurrence outcome : AOR 0 . 72 , 95 % CI 0 . 33 to 1 . 58 ) . Dose – response analysis The dose – response analysis suggests that the group A ‘Plausible Alternative’ intervention was more effective . Both intervention groups significantly reduced their beliefs in the misinformation after having listened to at least two episodes , compared with the control group ( see online supplemental table S6 ) . Limiting the analysis to only the two intervention groups , we found a signif - icant interaction between intervention group and dose for the belief that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes ( AOR 0 . 62 , 95 % CI 0 . 43 to 0 . 89 ) , showing that with increased number of episodes , group A performed better than group B ( online supplemental table S7 ) . This effect was not observed for the belief that typhoid and malaria co - occur ( AOR 0 . 80 , 95 % CI 0 . 58 to 1 . 11 ) . Furthermore , three episodes of the drama in group A were significantly better at reducing the typhoid - mosquito belief than the four episodes in the group B drama ( online supple - mental table S8 ) . Knowledge about preventive methods We scored participants’ knowledge about preventive methods on a scale ranging from −3 to + 3 . The data suggest that both interventions improved study partici - pants’ knowledge : at endline , 67 % of the participants in group A scored 1 or higher versus 66 % in group B and 51 % in the control group . Ordinal logistic regression showed that the two intervention groups scored signif - icantly higher than the control group ( group A : AOR 2 . 19 , 95 % CI 1 . 57 to 3 . 06 ; group B : AOR 1 . 79 , 95 % CI 1 . 27 to 2 . 50 ) , but there was no statistically distinguish - able effect between the two intervention groups ( online supplemental table S9 ) . Behavioural outcomes Exploratory analyses around behavioural outcomes showed that participants in group A were significantly less likely than the control group to report that they were sleeping under a bednet to prevent typhoid infection ( AOR 0 . 43 , 95 % CI 0 . 24 to 0 . 78 ) . There was no statistically significant association for group B ( AOR 0 . 64 , 95 % CI 0 . 36 to 1 . 12 ) ( online supplemental table S9 ) . Both inter - vention groups had significantly higher odds to report that they were drinking treated water to prevent typhoid infection ( group A : AOR 2 . 78 , 95 % CI 1 . 67 to 4 . 64 ; group B : AOR 1 . 77 , 95 % CI 1 . 08 to 2 . 91 ) . There were no statis - tical differences between intervention groups for either behavioural outcome . DISCUSSION Effectively correcting prevalent public health misinfor - mation is an urgent challenge . The CMT tested two ways of countering prevalent misinformation about typhoid using audio dramas delivered via WhatsApp . Results show that both intervention groups reduced belief in two types of misinformation compared with the control : the belief that typhoid is caused by mosquitoes and the belief that typhoid and malaria co - occur . Apart from changing the participants’ beliefs in prev - alent misinformation , both interventions also positively influenced people’s knowledge and yielded increases in an important protective practice ( drinking treated water ) . It should be noted that this measure was self - reported and might have suffered from social desirability bias . Further studies could gather longitudinal observa - tional data on behavioural risk reduction following ( mis ) information interventions . While both interventions reduced belief in misin - formation relative to the control group , the Plausible Alternative intervention group , which mentioned misinformation before debunking it , generally experi - enced stronger improvements in misinformation belief reduction than the Avoiding Misinformation interven - tion ( group B ) . This is consistent with evidence from laboratory - based studies . 54 While both interventions contained basic elements of storytelling , the debunking strategy of the Plausible Alternative group incorporated the dramatic element of conflict and debate , 55 56 which might have made the content ‘stick’ better . Both inter - ventions contained the same volume of scientifically correct , educational content , but intervention group A ‘invested’ additional story time in debunking misinfor - mation ; it is possible that increasing the length and scien - tific detail of the Avoiding Misinformation intervention could increase its effectiveness . Further research on these topics is warranted . However , the Plausible Alternative intervention did not yield statistically significant improve - ments relative to the Avoiding Misinformation interven - tion in knowledge of prevention measures or behavioural outcomes . Contrary to other trials with health communication interventions , 13 14 we found no evidence that the interven - tions created negative side effects . Despite concerns that specifically mentioning and debunking misinformation might inadvertently spread scientifically incorrect narra - tives , we found that the Plausible Alternative intervention did not seed misinformation among those who had previ - ously held correct beliefs . This could be because the risk of spreading misinformation is higher when those audi - ences are new to the misinformation . However , in our study a large majority of participants ( 94 % ) had heard of typhoid - malaria , which may have lowered the risk of seeding the misinformation among those who held the correct beliefs . 22 26 A major strength of this study is the study design . As a randomised field experiment , the CMT contributes to a small but growing body of research that tests strategies to counter misinformation in a community rather than laboratory setting or survey experiment . The interven - tion was designed to approximate a real - world public health communication effort , and therefore may have 10 Winters M , et al . BMJ Global Health 2021 ; 6 : e006954 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjgh - 2021 - 006954 BMJ Global Health stronger external validity than survey experiments and other commonly used tools to assess the efficacy of infor - mational interventions . Like other social media , WhatsApp , a widely used messaging platform with global reach , is a platform that can enable the spread of misinformation . 57 58 At the same time , WhatsApp’s wide reach could be used to deliver effective public health communication campaigns at scale , 58 while avoiding some of the challenges inherent to radio and television as information channels ( eg , information must be ‘consumed’ at time of broadcast , rather than when convenient for the receiver ) . Further studies are warranted to test corrective messages at scale . These studies might explore the potential for spillover effects , in particular the extent to which health informa - tion and educational messaging is shared with others , whether on or off the specific technology platform used to disseminate the intervention . In the case of the CMT , study participants were explicitly instructed not to share the audio dramas . However , real - world information inter - ventions could be much more impactful on a population level if recipients were encouraged to share them , and future studies could explore whether specific types of content , delivery or instructions can encourage ‘produc - tive’ spillover effects of health promotion messaging . This study also had several limitations . First , despite our ability to monitor message reception and follow - up with study participants , 30 % of our participants did not receive or listen to any of the audio episodes . If inter - ventions of this type would be implemented on a larger scale and with less intensive oversight , non - adherence could be higher . Further research could explore the effect of additional reminders and ‘nudges’ on listen - ership . The endline survey was conducted 8 weeks after the baseline . Future studies should assess the long - term ‘stickiness’ of improvements to knowledge and practices via these and other debunking methods . Furthermore , the misinformation we aimed to counter concerned a specific health - related myth that was not subject to politi - cised debates . Polarised misinformation might be harder to counter , although the evidence on this is inconclusive thus far . 59 60 Further experimental work is needed to examine whether the CMT intervention elements would yield similar improvements on polarising misinforma - tion . Similarly , while the misinformation in our study was explicitly debunked in the Plausible Alternative group , it would be of interest to study similar corrective efforts when misinformation consists of implied rather than explicit falsehoods , for instance , through the omission of relevant information . 61 CONCLUSION These limitations notwithstanding , we have shown that it is possible to reduce belief in misinformation rapidly , even where such beliefs are widely held and reinforced via the health system . A communications strategy that gives room to explain why misinformation is wrong and then provides scientifically correct information , is in line with existing worldviews , delivered by credible sources and gets repeated exposure has the potential to yield desired results without unintentionally seeding misinformation . This list of attributes may sound demanding . However , the results of this field experiment provide some grounds for optimism that even as misinformation becomes more prevalent , there are effective tools at hand to counter its impact and its spread .
