Although pilot studies evaluating the potential of MSCV - based retroviral vectors with this conﬁguration brighter than the wild - type GFP . 20 , 21 To obtain higher lev - els of GFP product in mammalian cells , the mut1GFP for exogenous gene expression in human HSPC have been encouraging , 12 , 23 there was reason to believe that coding region was re - engineered by using codons prefer - entially found in highly expressed primate proteins in removal of the PGK - 1 promoter may have a beneﬁcial effect on long - term MSCV LTR - directed gene addition to incorporating a Kozak sequence ( the consen - sus translation initiation site ) . 21 It has been shown that expression . 24 , 25 We therefore constructed a second retro - viral vector , MGIN , in which an internal ribosome entry these combinatorial improvements make EGFP (cid:46) 17 - fold brighter than the commonly used S65T GFP variant con - site ( IRES ) was used to coexpress the neo gene with the EGFP gene on a bicistronic transcript emanating from the taining a Kozak sequence . 21 We report the development of a reporter system using EGFP for the analysis of con - MSCV LTR ( Figure 1 ) . 26 , 27 As can be seen in Figure 2c , while approximately 60 % of BOSC23 cells transiently ditions leading to optimal retrovirus - mediated gene transfer into human primitive hematopoietic progenitors . transfected with either MGIN or MGPN2 plasmid DNA displayed green ﬂuorescence , MGIN yielded (cid:46) 10 - fold brighter mean ﬂuorescence intensity relative to MGPN2 .

Twenty hours after transfection , the cells Figure 3a , GFP ﬂuorescence directed by the MGPN vector were harvested and green ﬂuorescence in live cells was was only slightly above the high level of TF1 background cellular autoﬂuorescence . However , over half of the TF1 cells transduced with the MGPN2 vector displayed a medium to high level of ﬂuorescence intensity ( Figure 3b and b ¢ ) . Moreover , a similar percentage of MGIN - trans - duced TF1 cells displayed an even higher level of GFP ﬂuorescence ( Figure 3c and c ¢ ) . The high level of GFP ﬂuorescence achieved with MGIN was nearly off the scale so that it was necessary to lower the detection sensi - tivity in order to resolve the ﬂuorescent signals pro - portionally at the high end ( Figure 3b ¢ and c ¢ ) . When this was done , it was possible to estimate that the GFP signal intensity mediated by the MGIN vector was more than 10 - fold and 100 - fold greater , respectively , than that obtained with the MGPN2 and MGPN vectors .

Proliferating TF1 cells were exposed for 4 h to amphotropic retroviral supernatants of MGPN ( a ) , MGPN2 ( b ) or MGIN ( c ) produced by ProPak - A packaging cells . GFP expression 4 days after transduction was analyzed as in Figure 2 . The proﬁle of nontransduced TF1 cells ( a , thin line ) was overlaid to distinguish positive populations emitting GFP ﬂuorescence . Approximately 5 , 58 and 48 % of TF1 cells transduced with MGPN , MGPN2 and MGIN retroviral vectors , respect - ively , displayed GFP ﬂuorescence over background ( 0 . 2 % ) . To resolve the saturated brighter GFP ﬂuorescence in MGIN - transduced cells , the detec - tion sensitivity of the FL1 emission channel was reduced . The total 1024 recording channels were shifted to resolve the brightest ﬂuorescent signals ( on the right ) proportionally . The same MGPN2 and MGIN - transduced cells were then reanalyzed using the new setting ( b ¢ and c ¢ , respectively ) . The mean ﬂuorescence of GFP - expressing TF1 cells transduced with the MGIN vector was (cid:46) 11 - fold brighter than that for cells transduced with the MGPN2 vector . indicating that GFP expression was not detrimental to cellular properties ( data not shown ) .

Gene transfer efﬁciency and GFP expression level in live cells were sub - sequently analyzed by FACS ( Figure 4 ) . More than 75 % A GFP reporter system L Cheng etal 1016 Figure 4 FACS analysis of GFP gene transfer and expression in trans - duced human hematopoietic progenitors which retained the CD34 + Lin - phenotype . Sorted CD34 + Lin - human mPB progenitors were activated and transduced with amphotropic retroviral supernatants . ( a ) Conditioned medium from ProPak - A parental cells used as mock control , ( b ) MGPN2 and ( c ) MGIN viral supernatants . GFP expression was analyzed 5 days after ex vivo transduction . Expression of CD34 ( stained with a SR - conju - gated antibody ) and the Lin markers ( stained with PE - conjugated antibodies ) were also analyzed simultaneously . Live cells which did not express Lin markers were then gated and plotted for GFP as well as CD34 expression . The percentages of cells which expressed CD34 and / or GFP ( in green ) are indicated among the gated Lin - populations . The mean ﬂu - orescence of GFP - expressing cells transduced with the MGIN vector is (cid:46) 30 - fold brighter than that with the MGPN2 vector . cells retained the CD34 + Lin - progenitor phenotype , while total cell numbers increased approximately four - fold and two - fold , respectively , from the input BM or mPB CD34 + Lin - cells ( data not shown ) . Among mPB cells which retained the progenitor phenotype , approximately 35 % of CD34 + Lin - cells transduced by MGPN2 or MGIN expressed GFP at day 5 ( Figure 4 ) . Notably , however , MGIN - transduced cells exhibited (cid:46) 30 - fold brighter GFP ﬂuorescence than those transduced with MGPN2 vector . Similar results were observed with transduced CD34 + Lin - cells of BM origin ( data not shown ) . We also conﬁrmed that GFP expression in MGIN - trans - duced HSPC could be detected by ﬂuorescence microscopy . A portion of the cell population transduced with the MGIN vector was stained for CD34 expression and then deposited on to a microscope slide on day 4 ; as can be seen in Figure 5 , the majority of MGIN - or mock - transduced cells retained the CD34 antigen ( in red ) on the cell surface . In addition , approximately one quarter of the cells in the MGIN - transduced sample expressed cytoplasmic and nuclear GFP green ﬂuorescence , whereas (cid:44) 1 % of the mock - transduced cells displayed a detectable signal . Taken together with the ﬂow cyto - metric data , these experiments demonstrated that the EGFP gene driven by the MSCV LTR in the MGIN retro - viral vector is fully functional in primitive human hema - topoietic cells which retained a CD34 + Lin - progenitor phenotype during ex vivo gene transduction . Effectof GFPexpressionon biologicalpropertiesof transducedHSPC In addition to using GFP ﬂuorescence to evaluate gene transfer and expression in primitive human hematopo - ietic progenitors which retained the CD34 + Lin - pheno - type , we also analyzed GFP expression in live progeny cells derived from transduced CD34 + Lin - cells in two bioassays . The ﬁrst was an in vitro colony forming cell ( CFC ) assay which , depending on the cytokine combi - nation employed , detects clonogenic myeloid and erythroid progenitors in semi - solid medium . To estimate transduction efﬁciency of CFC on the basis of GFP expression , MGIN - or MGPN2 - transduced cells were plated in methylcellulose cultures under conditions sti - mulating the growth of CFU - GM progenitors which give rise to colonies of granulocytes and macrophages or BFU - E progenitors which give rise to colonies of erythroid cells . After 2 weeks , total and GFP - expressing colonies were enumerated by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Similar types and numbers of CFC ( approximately 22 % of total input cells ) were obtained in mock - , MGIN - or MGPN2 - A GFP reporter system L Cheng etal 1017 Figure 5 Fluorescence microscopy of CD34 and GFP expression in transduced human hematopoietic cells . CD34 + Lin - human progenitors transduced with the MGIN retroviral vector ( a ) or mock - transduced cells ( b ) were analyzed 4 days after ex vivo transduction . Cells were ﬁrst stained with the CD34 - SR antibody and then ﬁxed . The ﬁxed cells were then spun on to cytospin slides and analyzed by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy . Green ( GFP expression ) and red ( CD34 expression ) ﬂuorescent signals from the same ﬁeld were recorded sequentially through a · 20 objective lens . transduced cells . Approximately 28 % of colonies derived small CFC colonies were G418 resistant compared with 21 % of the MGPN2 - transduced cells ( Table 1 ) . These from MGIN - transduced progenitors expressed GFP ( Figure 6 and Table 1 ) , whereas some of the MGPN2 - results indicated that neomycin phosphotransferase activities as well as GFP levels mediated by the MGIN transduced cells displayed a weak signal which was not well above background ﬂuorescence ( background auto - vector were higher than those achieved with MGPN2 . The second HSPC assay we utilized was the cobble - ﬂuorescence was particularly high in BFU - E colonies ) . GFP ﬂuorescence in the case of MGIN - transduced cell stone area - forming cell ( CAFC ) assay , in which test cells are plated on a bone marrow - derived stromal cell mono - populations was observed in both CFU - GM and BFU - E colonies ( Figure 6b and d ) , although some larger BFU - E layer and progenitors form cobblestone - like colonies in long - term cultures . 30 Late - appearing CAFC ( after 4 – 5 colonies were not uniformly GFP positive . We also compared the transduction efﬁciency of CFC weeks ) are considered more primitive than CFC progeni - tors . 30 , 31 Accordingly , we plated MGIN - transduced by using two conventional methods . In the ﬁrst method , the presence of transgene - speciﬁc DNA sequences in CD34 + Lin - cells on the SyS - 1 clonal stromal cell line to monitor gene transfer and expression in these primitive individually picked colonies was investigated by PCR . The sensitive PCR analysis indicated that approximately progenitors . GFP expression was observed as expected in early - appearing myeloid cells in the cultures as well as 40 % of CFC arising from MGIN - transduced progenitors contained the MGIN transgene , and similar results were in CAFC colonies which appeared from 2 to 5 weeks . At week 5 , GFP ﬂuorescent signals were observed in obtained for MGPN2 - transduced cells ( Table 1 ) . These data indicated that the majority of progenitors containing approximately 15 – 20 % of CAFC colonies by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( data not shown ) . Examples of CAFC colon - the integrated MGIN vector could express the transgene at a detectable level ( 28 % GFP - expressing versus 40 % ies expressing GFP at week 5 are shown in Figure 7 ( a – d ) ; no green ﬂuorescent CAFC colonies were observed in gene - marked measured by PCR ) . A second conventional method to monitor functional gene transduction is enu - cultures of mock - transduced cells ( Figure 7e and f ) . meration of G418 - resistant colonies . We therefore plated transduced cells in various concentrations of G418 and Discussion determined the number of drug - resistant colonies after 2 weeks . A G418 concentration (cid:62) 0 . 85 mg / ml was required We have described in this article a combination of the EGFP variant and an improved MSCV - based retroviral to eliminate essentially all the colonies from mock - trans - duced mPB cells ( Table 1 ) .

Approximately 31 % of MGIN - transduced A GFP reporter system L Cheng etal 1018 Figure 6 Fluorescence microscopy of GFP expression in clonogenic cells . CD34 + Lin - cells transduced with MGIN ( a - d ) or mock supernatants ( e – h ) were plated in semi - solid medium to measure BFU - E and CFU - GM progenitor activities . Fourteen days later , plates were examined for colonies by a ﬂuorescence microscope with a · 10 objective lens . The upper row are samples of BFU - E colonies and the bottom row are CFU - GM colonies . The diameter of the central BFU - E colony is approximately 200 mm . Bright ﬁeld images ( a , c , e and g ) were taken without any ﬁlter and the corresponding green ﬂuorescent images ( b , d , f and h , respectively ) of the same colonies were taken with a FITC ﬁlter .

After 14 days , total or green ﬂuorescent ( GFP + ) colonies were counted by microscopy . Colonies of MGIN - or MGPN2 - transduced cells were individually picked and the presence of the GFP transgene was assessed by PCR . The mean and standard variation ( in brackets ) of the total numbers of colonies from each of three triplicates are listed in the ﬁrst row . Relative numbers of colonies were calculated by deﬁning the colony number of mock - transduced cells ( in the absence of G418 ) as 100 % .

Although G418 resistance pro - vides an estimation of gene transfer and expression in cell line . While sensitivity of detection of gene transfer based on GFP expression is no doubt still lower than that cells derived from transduced progenitors , G418 evi - dently retarded cell proliferation and / or differentiation achievable by PCR , we believe that the GFP reporter strategy is complementary to this DNA - based technique in the CFC assays since the sizes of the resulting colonies were much smaller in the presence of the drug ( Table 1 ) . and , for the intended purpose , arguably more relevant , since documentation of sustained retrovirus - mediated In contrast , GFP expression mediated by the MGIN vec - tor had no detectable detrimental effects on either freshly gene expression is ultimately the goal of these studies . In this regard , it is important that stable EGFP transduced cells or their differentiative potentials in the progenitor bioassays . Moreover , selection for GFP expression mediated by the MGIN retroviral vector did not interfere with the biological properties of HSPC , as expression has additional advantages over G418 and A GFP reporter system L Cheng etal 1020 exempliﬁed by their ability to give rise to progeny assess - packaging cells 43 were maintained in DMEM plus 5 % FCS .

Because several groups have reported that GFP is functional in mice and rats as well as in a variety of supernatants produced by PA317 packaging cells were made from selected producers after infection by BOSC23 lower organisms , 16 , 34 – 37 we anticipate that this marker will prove useful to monitor engraftment of HSPC in ecotropic viral stocks . 17 Amphotropic supernatants pro - duced by a human 293 cell - based ProPak - A packaging immune - deﬁcient mice and perhaps in clinical trials . 7 , 38 The simple and rapid GFP detection scheme enabled us line were made through transduction with pseudotyped viral stocks . 28 Brieﬂy , ProGag cells which constitutively to determine that the MGIN vector expressed the reporter (cid:46) 10 - fold higher than by the MGPN2 vector , although produce the MLV gag / pol protein were transiently cotransfected with vectors and a plasmid expressing the EGFP expression was under the transcriptional control of the MSCV LTR in both vectors . We also found that in VSV - G envelope protein . 45 Then the VSV - G pseudotyped retroviral supernatants collected at day 3 were used to CFC assays the neomycin phosphotransferase activity originating from the neo gene via an IRES in the MGIN transduce ProPak - A packaging cells .

For transduction , scription complex at one promoter changes the DNA top - ology such that another nearby transcription complex is fresh or previously frozen vector supernatants were mixed at a 1 : 1 ratio with medium containing target cells not efﬁciently formed , is presumably the explanation for this phenomenon . 39 It was of interest , however , that in the presence of 8 (cid:109) g / ml polybrene ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) . The transduction mixture was then centri - lower levels of MSCV LTR - directed EGFP expression from the MGPN2 vector were also observed in the transi - fuged at 1800 g at 32 – 35 (cid:176) C . After a 4 - h ‘spinoculation’ , cells were washed once and cultured in appropriate ent transfection experiments . It is possible that the latter effect is due to transcriptional interference reported in medium . 46 The end - point titers of three vector super - natants were similar ( 2 – 4 · 10 5 c . f . u . / ml ) , based on G418 episomal plasmids containing tandem promoters . 40 In any event , these ﬁndings suggest the use of retroviral resistance of NIH3T3 cells according to standard methods as described . 17 The G418 antibiotics from GIBCO / BRL vectors containing IRES sequences when a high - level expression of more than one exogenous gene is required were used at 1 mg / ml ( active ) for selecting transduced 3T3 , PA317 , ProPak - A and TF1 cells .
